Text: "The small convenience store in Surabaya shows the same vibe as the rest of\
  \ the city - excited and festive. \n\nThe upcoming Chinese New Year makes everyone\
  \ giddy for the celebration and probably upcoming vacations for some. \n\nI ask\
  \ the cashier where I can buy the train ticket. After pointing the small machine\
  \ by the entrance, the female cashier continues talking to her colleague excitedly.\
  \ \n\nAfter I put in my destination and date of departure, the machine shows me\
  \ the available train trips for the next day. Without thinking too much, I choose\
  \ the cheapest trip. And then take the small tub the machine released upon my payment.\
  \ \n\nThe following day is a series of chaos. From trying to find the train station\
  \ to figuring out how to exchange the small tub to a real train ticket in the station.\
  \ \n\nFinally, I reached the train that will take me to my next Indonesian city\
  \ - Yogyakarta. \n\nAfter finding a vacant seat, I realized that I am the only foreigner\
  \ in the carriage. And the only female among over 20 people. And then it hit me.\
  \ I booked a class ticket that poor Indonesians take to get to their work to the\
  \ capital. \n\nI have been to several countries before I headed to my one-month\
  \ trip to Indonesia. I started in Bali and working my way up through Java and then\
  \ Northern Sumantra. \n\nAnd I heard several horror stories inside Asian trains\
  \ where women were raped by their fellow passengers. Although it is currently in\
  \ broad daylight, the idea keeps nagging me and tempting me to leave the train before\
  \ it leaves. \n\nWhile I\u2019m contemplating whether to get off and take the next\
  \ train, an old man asks me if the seat is taken. I don\u2019t understand what he\
  \ said exactly but his body language is enough for me to read. I answer him in English\
  \ and that gets the attention of my fellow passengers. \n\nWith everyone eyeing\
  \ me, I started to get conscious. And as I decide to leave, a family enters the\
  \ carriage. With a kid and a woman in tow, it gives me the confidence to continue\
  \ with the trip. And as the train door closes, I pray hard for my safety. \n\nAs\
  \ we start our journey, two men decide to sit in front of me and the old man beside\
  \ me. By the looks of it, they all know each other. Out of curiousity, the younger\
  \ man asks me, \u201Cwhere you from?\u201D. And when I reply \u201CPhilippines\u201D\
  , the old man beside me gets so excited and say \u201CManny Pacquiao\u201D. I chuckled\
  \ in amusement and proceeded in asking the old man if he is a fan of boxing. Using\
  \ broken English and lots of body language, he explains to me how much he likes\
  \ boxing and how he is fascinated with Philippine politics. We talked about the\
  \ Marcoses - a popular political dynasty known globally for their corrupt practices.\
  \ \n\nOur chat is just a start. I learned that 70% of the men in the carriage are\
  \ constructions workers and drivers in Jakarta who goes home weekly to visit their\
  \ family after a full week of hard work in the city. With my limited Bahasa, I told\
  \ them I am travelling around Indonesia and I\u2019m worried about missing my stop\
  \ and the train will take me to Jakarta. They pacify me by saying they will take\
  \ care of it. \n\nThe next few hours are spent in playing cards, laughing and more\
  \ stories. And when it\u2019s time for a late lunch, these people whom I thought\
  \ badly initially, offer me their food. A food that they are probably saving for\
  \ a whole day of journey. A couple of them also offer me to try their snake and\
  \ alligator\u2019s dishes which they flippantly dare me to eat. \n\nThe whole trip\
  \ goes so fast and before I know it, my fellow passengers advise me to prepare my\
  \ stuff. \n\nWith a heavy heart, I collected my bags and say good bye to my new\
  \ found friends. And as if their kindness isn\u2019t enough, a couple of them help\
  \ me with my bags and an entire carriage of passengers are wishing me good luck."
