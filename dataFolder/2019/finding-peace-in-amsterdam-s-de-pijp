Text: "\u201COk, I\u2019m going to see you in a minute at the Rijksmuseum. Is it okay\
  \ to bring a classmate?\u201D I texted my friend and Amsterdam local Max. It was\
  \ my last day in Amsterdam before having to go back to Austria and I was missing\
  \ the city already - whether it be the lively, colorful streets and narrow, winding\
  \ alleys or the boats peacefully floating through Amsterdam\u2019s grachten.\nAs\
  \ I found Max she told us that she is going to show us a more urban and modern district\
  \ of Amsterdam called De Pijp. Leaving the Museumkwartier and entering De Pijp felt\
  \ like entering a different world - the whole atmosphere of this district was completely\
  \ different. All these vibrant colors coming from various street decorations or\
  \ cafes got amplified by the bright sun gently shining down and getting beautifully\
  \ reflected from the grachten. The streets were filled with the calm sounds of music\
  \ getting played and everything seemed peaceful and in place, whether it be a cat\
  \ running across the street or a bicyclist not seeing said cat and avoiding a crash\
  \ in the last second.\nWe continued our stroll until we arrived at the rather busy\
  \ Albert Cuyp Market, a street market named after a painter from the 17th century;\
  \ after passing several street vendors and doing some shopping at a second-hand\
  \ clothing store, my friend stopped and pointed at a small food truck crowded by\
  \ a bunch of people; Max said \u201CI think you both know by now what a Stroopwafel\
  \ is - here you can purchase the best, freshly made Stroopwafel in the whole city.\u201D\
  \ Biting into this warm and gooey treat was truly life-changing: it felt like a\
  \ warm, assuring hug after accomplishing something grand and the still slightly\
  \ warm caramel was oozing out between the two dough halves. All in all, I was in\
  \ a moment of complete bliss - something I never thought could be achieved by food.\n\
  But, like all good moments, these few seconds also found to an end and after collectively\
  \ devouring this dessert we continued our stroll through this lively and multicultural\
  \ street. After taking a few turns and almost getting run over by two bicycles I\
  \ could make out a faint sound of a violin being played in a nearby park. Completely\
  \ absorbed by this lighthearted tune, I shifted to autopilot determined to find\
  \ the source. Suddenly, I was face-to-face with a Koi, that directly stared back\
  \ into my eyes, almost ridiculing me. I was so caught up in the moment I slipped\
  \ and almost plunged into the small fish pond. \nAs I got up, still a little bit\
  \ startled, I noticed the violin was gone and even though I was disappointed in\
  \ the first place, falling in the ground for nothing - I still ended up being grateful\
  \ as soon as I looked up in the sky, letting the sun shine on my face I enjoyed\
  \ the peaceful sound of the birds chirping. Feeling completely disconnected and\
  \ being able to quietly take a few breaths, far away from all the traffic noise\
  \ and everyday stress, was truly a huge relief and I left the park happier than\
  \ before, catching up with my friends and continuing our walk through De Pijp on\
  \ my last day in Amsterdam..."
