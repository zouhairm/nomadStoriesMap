Text: "In August of 2018, I traveled to the quaint town of Obuse in central Japan\
  \ - known for its chestnuts and the famous Hokusai museum - as a camp mentor in\
  \ an educational summer program. \nOne night, my friends and I were welcomed into\
  \ the house of a local family for dinner. The evening turned into a five-hour feast\
  \ punctuated by our rolling of nori (sushi paper) voraciously amid comparisons of\
  \ our different cultures and ways of life. Tadashi, the father and head of the household,\
  \ is a professional wine-taster and his eagerness to spread his love for the sweet\
  \ drink made the evening even more eventful. He opened four bottles and when he\
  \ wasn\u2019t busy refilling our glasses, I told him about Bulgaria, my home country.\n\
  \u201CMy hometown is old cobblestone streets and a mix of European and Near-Eastern\
  \ architecture with a bitter Soviet aftertaste,\u201D I conjured up the image of\
  \ Sofia for Tadashi as best as I could recall. I hadn\u2019t lived there for over\
  \ 6 years. \u201CWe have a square with an Orthodox church, a mosque, and a synagogue\
  \ all facing each other. It\u2019s a very diverse city, anyone can feel at home\
  \ there!\u201D\n\u201CJapan is more closed,\u201D said Tadashi. \u201COur culture\
  \ is more isolated.\u201D\nAnd yet, the generosity and openness of the Tadashi family\
  \ were unrivaled by my experience of any Western country, including Bulgaria. It\
  \ could be that all-night wine and cheering tipped the scales in their favor but\
  \ that feeling resounded throughout my three-week stay in Japan. \nI spent my free\
  \ time sightseeing the mountains that crowned the town of Obuse, tasting various\
  \ local plates, and picking up Japanese words from my students. They called their\
  \ chestnuts \u201Cmarron,\u201D for example, and around 5 p.m. an excited murmur\
  \ of the word \u201Consen\u201D echoed around the conversation area.\nThe onsen\
  \ is a Japanese hot spring akin to a spa with public showers and hot pools. What\
  \ I didn\u2019t know at the time is that it\u2019s customary for bathers here to\
  \ dip in the nude. Despite the ample amount of steam in the main area, broad daylight\
  \ penetrated the fog and illuminated the toe-ridden bottoms of the pools, turning\
  \ the space into an exhibitionist\u2019s dream-place, though that was hardly the\
  \ point.\nGoing in, I was hyperaware of my naked body. I waded through the wet floor,\
  \ terrified that each slosh forward drew a new pair of eyes to me. I daringly looked\
  \ around as if to parry the gazes of any onlookers, but, to my surprise, I was met\
  \ with friendly indifference: no one looked twice at me. Instead, people\u2019s\
  \ attention was either inward, as the heat lulled their bodies to total relaxation,\
  \ or they were placidly gazing at the mountain-view.\nBy the 3rd time I stripped\
  \ and sunk in the steamy onsen, the bodily self-consciousness I had clung to as\
  \ part of my culture began to dissolve in the heat and comfort of the sauna. I became\
  \ one with my surroundings, taking in the view like everyone else; I was finally\
  \ a part of the experience.\nThe blissful collective presence at the onsen gave\
  \ me a hint as to what Japanese culture may be about, and why it doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ that everyone - students, friends, teachers - goes to bathe together naked. In\
  \ Western cultures, we worry about blending in and standing out as individuals,\
  \ but when you take part in a collective experience, the ego becomes secondary.\
  \ You can just be because everyone else just is. \nIn August, I had told Tadashi\
  \ that anyone can belong in my hometown of Sofia. In December, I went back for the\
  \ first time in a long time, and I realized that what I had said was a lie. After\
  \ 6 years of living abroad, I no longer fit in my past home. What I had described\
  \ to Tadashi were postcard images of the city, but those were a romantic myth.\n\
  It wasn\u2019t until I stripped naked in a crowded public spa that I fully realized\
  \ the power of shared experience. Dress may play a unique role in uniting communities,\
  \ but the collective presence, whether formed by mutual curiosity or indifference\
  \ to one\u2019s body, is perhaps an even more potent connecting force."
