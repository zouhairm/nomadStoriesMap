Text: "Platypus. Platypus. Platypus. It was the word that replayed in my head that\
  \ day when I got into the car. Ever since I arrived in Australia it had become an\
  \ obsession. In each river, lake or hole of water I passed by, I was hypnotized\
  \ by the water looking at the surface in search. Something I learned from these\
  \ shy little creatures is to search only at dawn or dusk when they leave their burrows\
  \ to feed. Watching, Waiting. Any movement beneath the surface was a reason enough\
  \ for me to keep staring for several minutes. Finally, my boyfriend had to drag\
  \ my arm and pull me away just like a small child. Taking me away from my hypnotic\
  \ state. I had no right to complain. I have been in Australian from Spain for only\
  \ a year, some Australians can go their whole lives without ever seeing this fascinating\
  \ creature. A sign of good luck to the Indigenous Australians due to the rareness\
  \ in sighting.\nAfter a long conversation, our next outing revolved around the search\
  \ for the platypus. My boyfriend and I, after hours of research concluded that the\
  \ best place to see the platypus in the wild would be not too far from Melbourne.\
  \ It was at Lake Elizabeth.\nWe arrived when the sun was beginning to descend. We\
  \ still had a couple of hours of light before the night fell. This was just enough\
  \ time to go around the lake several times. Each time trying to work out which would\
  \ be the perfect spot. We found several places where we could see a good piece of\
  \ water. The larger the surface, the better the chances of spotting a platypus.\
  \ During the golden hour I forced myself to sit on a small embankment that went\
  \ down to the lake and wait.\nThe buzzing of a cloud of mosquitoes on the shore\
  \ only increased my nervousness. As we waited I knew that today was the day, but\
  \ I was afraid that my sixth sense was wrong. I lost count of how many times I got\
  \ up. Trying to find the perfect perspective of the lake. As if standing and taking\
  \ several steps from one side to the other was to active a spring that would bring\
  \ up all the platypus from the bottom of the lake. In the end, it was a root that\
  \ made me fall to the ground and from here I did not get up again. Thus, there between\
  \ roots and ferns, surrounded by branches and mosquitoes was when I saw it. A small\
  \ flat head with a beak, swimming right in front of us. My hand was pointing in\
  \ his direction, while my throat a muffled inward cry. No sound came out but filling\
  \ my mouth with mosquitoes in awe. A few seconds passed and the platypus was submerged\
  \ again. It was here when I exploded with emotion. The words piled up in my mouth\
  \ trying to describe to my boyfriend the moment we had just experienced. A reaction\
  \ he is used to when I become overexcited\u2026\nOn our way back we met an Australian\
  \ family with two children. They had also gone to the lake with the same expectations\
  \ of seeing platypus. Unlike us, they did not succeed. How fortunate we truly were.\
  \  As we walked behind the family looking at the ground so as not to trip when the\
  \ youngest kid exclaimed: \u201Clook mum there is a glow party\u201D. The moment\
  \ we raised our heads to discover what the child was referring to, what we did not\
  \ expect to find were thousands of stars shining at the height of our eyes. It was\
  \ not the first time I saw glow worms, but that time it was simply beautiful. That\
  \ night, luck smiled on us."
