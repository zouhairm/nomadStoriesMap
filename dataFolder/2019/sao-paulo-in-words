Text: "When I left Mexico, I did not wake up with any emotion, I do not understand\
  \ how some people feel butterflies in their stomachs before leaving. Was I afraid?\
  \ I do not know, maybe I'm living a dream that I do not know if it's true or just\
  \ imagination.\nThe farewell was more difficult than I expected, from the first\
  \ moment I embraced moni (my girlfriend) I started to cry, it gave me that feeling\
  \ of thinking that I would never see her again: / we told ourselves how much we\
  \ loved each other and we said goodbye with a kiss on the forehead. After I said\
  \ goodbye to my sister, in a while she will go to work in Spain and that's where\
  \ I realize that the family has not stopped growing, everyone will take their bearings\
  \ and in a blink of an eye, the house, where there was no day that there was no\
  \ laughing of children playing, only the swing of the trees will be heard. How does\
  \ time go by? The farewell of my parents was painful, I saw my dad cry and believe\
  \ me they are counted the times he has done it, I gave him many kisses as well as\
  \ my mom, he told me to drink a lot of water and eat lots of fruits ... Oh my mom\
  \ :)\nEveryone said goodbye to me with a smile and that image I carry with me from\
  \ now on.\nMy flight to Panama I felt a little heavy, and almost came to see many\
  \ ships with containers, as if they were pirate ships. Upon arriving I realize that\
  \ I have no data and that I have time on it because I had 30 min or less to board\
  \ the next plane. They have been one of the most stressful things that have happened\
  \ to me in my entire life. :(\nI have taken the plane to S\xE3o Paulo, my final\
  \ destination. When I arrived, I could not understand any single word in Portuguese,\
  \ how can some people say that Portuguese is the same as Spanish? I made my exchange\
  \ at the Funda\xE7\xE3o Armando \xC1lvares Pendeado, for the course of international\
  \ relations, from the first moment that the classes began, all the students were\
  \ very kind to me, my dream is to return to take classes there, after 5 months living\
  \ in a country different from mine, I learned to speak Portuguese, not as a native\
  \ but I advanced a lot. I realized that Brazil is the happiest country in the world."
