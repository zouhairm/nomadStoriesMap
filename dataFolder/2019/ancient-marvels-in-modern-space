Text: "It was the next morning; a new day. I woke up still in disbelief, a bit nauseous,\
  \ a little apprehensive, and extremely terrified.  In the process of adding a checkmark\
  \ to my mental bucket list, I had taken a huge leap outside of my comfort zone,\
  \ while simultaneously ignoring the very stern--albeit affectionate--warnings from\
  \ my father, \u201CDon\u2019t do it, Bran. I don't think this is a good idea\u2026\
  \u201D For the first time in my life, I chose to \u201Cdisobey\u201D him; risking\
  \ his disapproval and disappointment. I decided to proceed in faith, trusting that\
  \ the peace I had in my heart was divine; a blessing from the Lord. I was going\
  \ to enjoy this. I was determined to. I trusted Him--at least I wanted to. \n\n\
  It was my first official full day in the country I had dreamed of visiting since\
  \ those days when I sat, casually slouched in a bolted seat, in a random lecture\
  \ hall. Your typical Art History class at Georgia Southern University is where I\
  \ often found myself zoning in and out of vivid daydreams wishing I were exactly\
  \ where I managed to find myself on that day.  In a humble abode (at best) with\
  \ a clear view of one of the original Seven Wonders of the World is where, in the\
  \ wee hours of the morning through foggy eyes coupled with what felt like first-day\
  \ nervous jitters, crippling anxiety, and a stomach full of butterflies, reality--literally\
  \ and figuratively-- hit me.  Albeit 15 years later,  I had finally made it.\n\n\
  Despite the loss of feeling in my legs, I managed to stumble out of the bed (without\
  \ falling might I add) and lumber to the window. The amber laden ombre` sunrise\
  \ forced its way through the sheer, textured window panels as I quickly shielded\
  \ my eyes from the aggressive rays and slowly drew the window panels back.\n\nTo\
  \ my astonishment, there was smog--lots of smog--but yet and still, there they stood\
  \ seemingly unbothered by the vigorous hustle and bustle of the bus-ridden city\
  \ surrounding it. Despite the age difference between these ancient beauties and\
  \ the modern city, they seemed to demand attention in the most humble way. It's\
  \ almost like they were acutely aware and in humble command of their eternal space\
  \ in this ever-changing place. \n\nI couldn't help but marvel at the dichotomy of\
  \ it all. An ancient city surrounded by a bustling metropolis, yet there was the\
  \ ever-present, admirable character of these structures who had managed to survive\
  \ centuries of adjacent transformation. I was in utter awe. I felt privileged, blessed,\
  \ downright lucky even. It was happening. I was here. Finally.\n\nWhew!  \u201C\
  Time to collect yourself, Bran,\u201D I muttered.  I sent the necessary, \u201C\
  I'm alive, I made it safely\u201D texts to loved ones, snapped a few Instagram worthy\
  \ photos, and quickly hustled outside of my hotel room in hopes that I could discover\
  \ a better view. To my excitement and surprise, at the end of the corridor was a\
  \ balcony adorned with french doors that led out to the street via stairs. They\
  \ were even more spectacular from this vantage point. \n\nThe sights were now accompanied\
  \ by the sounds of a bustling city--sirens, car horns, and the movement of tires\
  \ speeding along across the pavement. Yet, there they stood, one of those Seven\
  \ Wonders of the World, these ancient beauties. \n\nThey were the reason for my\
  \ choosing to defy my loving, yet overly cautious father. The reason that I had\
  \ spent many hours in prayer for peace and settling in my heart and spirit. The\
  \ reason why I managed to put myself in a little debt and invest in a GoPro camera.\
  \ The reason why I wanted to celebrate my 34th birthday away from loved ones. The\
  \ reason why I had nausea, anxiety, butterflies and unstable legs. They were the\
  \ Ancient Pyramids and I was finally getting an opportunity to rub shoulders with\
  \ the magnificence and breathtaking marvel of these astounding beauties."
