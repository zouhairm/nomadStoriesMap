Text: "My husband\u2019s last wish was for every guest to have one of these. The matronly\
  \ woman hands us a book. I feel a pang of guilt when I examine the cover and think\
  \ it cheap. In the center, a tilted photograph of the Amalfi Coast. The font and\
  \ arrangement of the title remind me of the Power Point presentations I used to\
  \ make for class in my teens. He died seventeen months ago, to the day. \nI look\
  \ out the window, onto the lemon grove. The first trees have started to bloom. The\
  \ night is tapestried with fireflies. My eyelids feel heavy; my partner and I left\
  \ Rome at the crack of dawn and drove down to the Coast, not having decided where\
  \ we would spend the night, or even if this would just be a daytrip. Having fortuitously\
  \ ended up in Ravello, a place neither of us had heard of before, we immediately\
  \ became enchanted by the strange town perched atop a hill. Its quiet winding alleys\
  \ called to us. Ravello has a very distinct character, and while it boasts of some\
  \ of the same breath-taking vistas as other cities on the coast, its relative seclusion\
  \ has allowed it to remain less frequented than places like Amalfi or Positano.\
  \ Yet because we booked last minute, we could only find a place that was relatively\
  \ far from the main square. Thankfully, we had the car. The inn was secluded, and\
  \ had we gone on foot, we would have had to go down at least 500 steps down a street\
  \ off of the main square. As we parked next to a garden overlooking the water, it\
  \ was already dark, but I knew the view in the morning would be stunning.  \nI was\
  \ born in this house, the woman says. My husband and I were together for fifty years.\
  \  When we married, this became our home. My son and I have run the inn since he\
  \ died. Da quando \xE8 venuto a mancare, she says, a phrase to which I have not\
  \ yet become accustomed, even years after living in Italy. It translates, literally,\
  \ into \u201Cfrom when he came to miss,\u201D though it simply means \u201Cfrom\
  \ when he left us.\u201D My partner and I exchange a sympathetic look. Something\
  \ about the house is teeming with contradictions. The room\u2019s signs of recent\
  \ remodeling\u2014the polished granite tiles and shiny kitchen appliances\u2014\
  contrast with the well-preserved but antiquated china cabinets and the many elaborately\
  \ embroidered doilies in the room. \nDrink this limoncello. I made it, her eyes\
  \ glow as she pours from a thin, long bottle. My glass is cold. Silently, she searches\
  \ our eyes for approval. Do you have a wife, children? she asks my grey-haired boyfriend.\
  \ No, he says, sono giovane nel cuore, I am young at heart. She seems to think that\u2019\
  s neither here nor there. \nI hope you won\u2019t mind sleeping in the same bed.\
  \ We exchange a look of mischief. We\u2019ve somehow become accustomed to this.\
  \ We tell her it\u2019s fine, we\u2019re going back to Rome early next morning.\
  \ You will excuse my clothes. I wasn\u2019t expecting you. A white kerchief envelops\
  \ her head, and else she is covered in black. Please, it\u2019s your home, I say,\
  \ and look down at the book of poems: La Forza del Pensiero, by Mario Buonocore.\
  \ I learn from the blurb that he had been known as the poeta muratore, the bricklayer\
  \ poet, because he had become an artisan after his family\u2019s economic situation\
  \ did not allow him to continue his studies beyond elementary school. There is a\
  \ picture of him on the back cover, his skin wrinkled by years under the sun. He\
  \ is snipping lemons into a wicker basket, barely able to contain a smile. The lemons\
  \ are big as softballs. I could swear I notice some traits of his wife in him, or\
  \ the other way around: the almond eyes, thin lips, protruded cheekbones. And I\
  \ wonder if protracted love is like a projected metamorphosis, a displacement of\
  \ the self. Or if it is just that the grief in the room has gotten to me."
