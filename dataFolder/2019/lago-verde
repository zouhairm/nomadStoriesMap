Text: "At 2017 I worked for the whole summer in San Vincenzo, Toscana. That was a\
  \ pretty untouchable place near the Tyrrhenian Sea, full of pine forests and eucalyptus\
  \ trees. After Krasnoyarsk (Siberia), where I've come from, with its polluted air\
  \ and gray streets, this place was a total heaven. By the way, I had just stopped\
  \ smoking cigarettes to that time, so I fully enjoyed the fresh mediterranean air.\
  \ \n\nThe hotel, where I lived, was in 2 km from San Vincenzo, so I was happy, that\
  \ I got my skateboard (this saved me so much time and nerves, actually). During\
  \ 2 weeks I've visited San Vincenzo, Pisa and Florence. All this time I went to\
  \ the San Vincenzo' side to travel further by train or by bus. One day I decided\
  \ to ruin this habit and decided to go by skateboard to another side. I was little\
  \ bit scared, because I rode too fast on the highway in the dark, and there was\
  \ no light at all. I used flashlight of my mobile phone to light 1.5-2 meters of\
  \ the road. \"One small stone or piece of wood and I will become a bloody mince\
  \ in a second\" - I thought.\n\nI've stopped when I heard reggae music nearby in\
  \ the forest. To this moment there was nothing around me in radius of 3 kilometers,\
  \ except dark blue forest and empty highway. \"Bad people don't listen reggae music\"\
  \ - said my mind. I put my skateboard in a case and took the path, leading to the\
  \ outgoing sound. I imagined small company, private party or just a car in the wood,\
  \ but the first I've seen were families with small children, running around the\
  \ trees and playing hide'n'seek between trees. Their parents were smoking weed and\
  \ laughed a lot. Every of them had a dreadlocks and funny colorful hat. I went further,\
  \ inside the forest and was incredibly amazed - reggae wasn't just a recording,\
  \ there was a live music!\n\nI love reggae, but I've never been on a live concert.\
  \ \"Grazie, Italia!\" - I shouted in my head. There was a lot of people on the improvised\
  \ dance floor, singing, smoking weed and dancing as free as they wanted. \"Is here\
  \ a legalized area for smoking weed?\" - I asked a man, which looked like a typical\
  \ rastaman. He had just looked on me with panic face and went away. That meant \"\
  no\", I suppose. The party was organised pretty well, with a good quality sound,\
  \ foodtruck and branded souvenirs with the \"Lago Verde\" logo. I took a glass of\
  \ wine and asked one of staff guys about this party. Andrea told me, that this is\
  \ temporary parties, with soul, reggae, funk and jazz music concerts and it called\
  \ Lago Verde, that means \"green lake\". I thought that this \"green lake\" associates\
  \ with a lot of weed here, nice parallel. \n\nI didn't expect to find a piece of\
  \ genuine Jamaica here, in Italy, in the night forest. I felt myself like Indiana\
  \ Jones or Christopher Columbus, that had just opened a place, free from walls,\
  \ free from city sounds, even free from the law. I sat on the sand shore with reggae\
  \ forest behind my back and stared on the water for a half of hour or more.\n\n\"\
  ...uhm, where is my skateboard?\""
