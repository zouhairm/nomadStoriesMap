Text: "My wife and I had just returned from our big wedding in Nigeria and were brainstorming\
  \ together in a bid to reach a compromise on a country to spend our honey moon at.\
  \ I suggested we visit the palm Jumeirah hotel in Dubai but my wife wouldn't buy\
  \ the idea; it definitely exceeded our budget according to her. I got furious and\
  \ resolved to verbally bully her into submission but on second thought, it dawned\
  \ on me that I wasn't a single man no more and as such I had lost the liberty of\
  \ making hasty and selfish decisions without considering her opinion. \n\nBelieve\
  \ me it was a difficult thing to do but I swallowed my pride and let her make the\
  \ decision. She opted for Lanzarote and I consented as neither of us had ever been\
  \ there. We booked our flights and accommodation and the next day we took off from\
  \ Birmingham airport en route lanzarote; a journey without any foreknowledge of\
  \ what to expect, a leap into the unknown.\n\nIt was a four hour flight; we spent\
  \ the first hour experiencing severe turbulence which got everyone jittery and panicky\
  \ but the pilot managed to put our minds at ease as the remaining three hours were\
  \ entirely calm and devoid of turbulence.  Traveling light proved to be advantageous\
  \ as it meant we headed straight to passport control and skipped the part of having\
  \ to wait for our luggage. The chubby cheeked immigration officer with a cheerful\
  \ mien greeted us, welcomed us to lanzarote, stamped our passports and said enjoy\
  \ your stay.\n\nTrust me, a location like Lanzarote with the beautiful sights it\
  \ wields deserves to make international news headlines on a daily basis but sadly\
  \ that isn't the case. I guess the international community does have a reputation\
  \ for underrating people and places. Driving through the city in our rented car\
  \ to the Rubicon palace hotel where we booked for our stay, i kept my eyes affixed\
  \ on the beautiful mountains and deserts and wondered why i  had opted for Dubai\
  \ in the first place. owing to a minor road construction, we were held up in traffic\
  \ for 10 minutes which meant the journey from the airport to our hotel took forty\
  \ minutes instead of the estimated thirty minutes. \n\nUpon arrival at the hotel,\
  \ we checked in successfully and followed the hotel chauffeur who drove us to our\
  \ room which was situated five minutes away from the main reception. We decided\
  \ to chill in the comfort of our room that day and begin our adventure the next\
  \ day which was preceded by an argument on whether the AC should stay on all night\
  \ or not; again i let her win for she had cold allergies.\n\nShe was already dressed\
  \ before i woke up the next morning so I had to hurry up so we could commence our\
  \ adventure. indeed there were too many alluring sights to behold beginning from\
  \ the poshness of the hotel down to its ambrosial buffets, amazing swimming pools\
  \ and complimentary hotel entertainment.\n\nMy wife's attention was drawn to a couple\
  \ who were dressed in swimming gear and set for scuba diving and suddenly she screamed\
  \ aloud, \"I want to do that as well and you are coming with me\". \"Hell no I said\
  \ for I had such a phobia for water but she kept nagging and wouldn't budge, i finally\
  \ had to oblige her against my will; the things we do for love and peace.\n\nScuba\
  \ diving wasn't in any way on my bucket list, I wasn't even close to being classified\
  \ as an amazing swimmer but with the guide of experts we made the leap into the\
  \ unknown, it turned out to be a beautiful sight but I definitely wouldn't do it\
  \ again as it scared the hell out of me. \n\nThe rest of the trip was mind blowing\
  \ and exposed me to several activities I would never have done if i had insisted\
  \ on Dubai. on our way back to Birmingham, I resolved to trust her judgment subsequently\
  \ as her insistence on Lanzarote proved to be a worthy one."
