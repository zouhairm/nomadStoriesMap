Text: "\u201CWhen I opened my eyes, I found myself in the city of paradise - Amsterdam\u201D\
  \n It all began when I was in India, packing my stuff, three days prior to my flight\
  \ to London (it was a connecting flight via Amsterdam). The question popped in my\
  \ mind why not to take the solo trip to the city of my dreams (Amsterdam), when\
  \ I still have my schengen visa with me before I head over to London for my convocation.\
  \ \nI always had a dream to travel solo and opportunity always knocks the door once.\
  \ I grabbed that opportunity, re-booked my flight, made a booking at dorm for a\
  \ night. The excitement was at its peak that finally I could visit the places which\
  \ I always had in the back of my mind.\nThis brings me to the Schiphol Airport where\
  \ I landed at 11:00 a.m. It was a perfect time to visit this city when tulips bulb\
  \ blooms in spring. I figured my way out of the airport and bought an Amsterdam\
  \ travel card, valid for two days which gave access to any means of public transport.\
  \ \n I took the train for the Central Station and from there I boarded a metro for\
  \ Nieuwmarkt and from there I walked down to my hostel, Shelter City. I was excited\
  \ and nervous at the same time. To my relief, the accommodation was pretty cool.\
  \ There I met two girls from France and we decided to explore this happening city\
  \ together. \nI grabbed my map and followed it to canals and streets, surrounded\
  \ with bicycles on every corner, captured the best of moments. The colorful houses\
  \ along the canals felt like a storybook. The best thing about the canals was the\
  \ boathouses and the floating flower market, which made the city so serene that\
  \ it felt like time stopped for a while.\nWhile admiring its cultural diversity,\
  \ how can we miss the dutch food! We had stroopwafels, poffertjes and croquette\
  \ and a coffee. Then we went to Dam Square (national monument), Royal Palace and\
  \ Amsterdam Museum. Thus, adoring its historical beauty. From there we split our\
  \ ways, as I wanted to explore the unexplored. By then, it was a dusk time, city\
  \ appeared to be so eye-captivating that it could be perfectly described as a colorful\
  \ walk on the streets. With the help of locals, I found a perfect place where I\
  \ had the exquisite food. Later, I went to the world\u2019s most famous red light\
  \ district, which all over had a different vibe. (Oh! I forgot to mention, red light\
  \ street was behind my hostel). There I again met my new friends and sat near the\
  \ canals, shared our life experiences and end the night with dancing beneath the\
  \ city lights.\nEarly in the morning, I enjoyed the cold breeze and the next thing\
  \ I did  was to plan an itinerary. We started the day with an amazing buffet and\
  \ part our ways. People visit this city for all kinds of fun experiences. But being\
  \ an artist, I came here for all the different reasons and one of the most important\
  \ one is my love for Vincent Van Gogh. I took a tram to Van Gogh Museum and after\
  \ reaching the destination, I was overwhelmed to look at his paintings which were\
  \ more mesmerizing in real life. Then, I visited Stedelijk Museum, Rijksmuseum and\
  \ Museumplein which left a tremendous impact on me. So, just like tourist does,\
  \ I got myself clicked in front of \u2018I AMSTERDAM\u2019. Before I had my flight\
  \ to catch, I went to the most famous Barney\u2019s coffees hop and got a special\
  \ cake.\nI started this journey with no clue on how it will turn out but little\
  \ did I know that this is the best chance to explore myself. It changed my outlook\
  \ towards life and gave me a chance to meet new people and to know different cultures.\
  \ Thus, I ended up making new friends for a lifetime. For me travelling solo was\
  \ a life changing experience, one should try it at least once!"
