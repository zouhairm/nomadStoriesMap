Text: "\u201CYou ok ?\u201D\nI opened my eyes to see my sister staring at me, her\
  \ eyebrows furrowed with worry. \nI had been shivering , quite loudly, for the last\
  \ hour or so and I must\u2019ve woken her up.\n\nI was stripped down to just a tank\
  \ top and undershorts and was curled up in my sleeping bag like a caterpillar ,\
  \ not as calm and still , but hoping for a transformation nonetheless.\nThe last\
  \ 48 hours had been tough, to say the least.\n\nWe had abandoned our attempt to\
  \ summit Mt.Kilimanjaro, a couple of hours back , just as we were approaching our\
  \ final camp at the top. \nI was soaking wet ,head to toe, and could see my sister\u2019\
  s jacket slightly sagging underneath the rain drenched weight , dripping slightly,\
  \ as she ambled on , a little ahead of me. \n\nIn addition to the cold and the rains\
  \ , she had been battling acute altitude sickness but vowed to go on as far as she\
  \ could , taking one small step at a time.\nMy sister was afraid of heights but\
  \ here she was , determined to scale the highest mountain in Africa or at least\
  \ get as high as she could.\nI remember us standing a few feet from that final camp\
  \ , deliberating whether to head left and push ahead with the final summit or head\
  \ right , down the steep valley and back to base camp , effectively putting an end\
  \ to this trek.\n\nWe had endured rains from dawn to dusk for the last 4 days and\
  \ braved Barranco wall \u2013 an awe inspiring lava rock monolith that stretched\
  \ up into the clouds. \nIt stood between us and our mountain ;  and so it would\
  \ come to be  that to get to the snows of Africa we had to first get past the lava\
  \ or at least what was once lava.\n\nHowever, on that particular day it hosted mini\
  \ waterfalls as a result of the incessant rains of the days before.\nAs I climbed\
  \ one section and stepped onto one side, I had a stream of water fall directly onto\
  \ my feet. \nMy sturdy waterproof hiking boots had finally given up on me ; I could\
  \ feel my toes get wet as the water seeped through. \nThe rains did more than soak\
  \ our clothes , it broke our spirit and all we wanted at this point was to stop\
  \ and magically transport ourselves to somewhere warm and sunny.\n\nOur start had\
  \ been pleasant enough , through the calm and winding forests paths and onto the\
  \ grasslands that seemed to stretch on forever.\nThese Plains were my favourite\
  \ part  of the trek.\nI would close my eyes and imagine all the beings that may\
  \ have taken the exact same steps as I had along this path.\nIt was here, one morning,\
  \ that we found tiny sparrows had entered our tents at sunrise.\nI must admit ,\
  \ there was some poetic  justice about that sudden invasion of our space by these\
  \ natives of the land , when it was typically the other way around.\n\nThe grasslands\
  \ were beautiful beyond description and never ending and they eventually lead us\
  \ to the moors that would prove to be the turning point of our journey.\nHere the\
  \ rains coupled with the mist limited visibility to just 10-20 meters ahead.\nThe\
  \ quiet gave us a sense of eerie fear of what lay ahead and had us question our\
  \ ability and , moreover, our desire to conquer this summit. \nThat grey ,cold and\
  \ damp place ; where we couldn\u2019t hear the birds anymore or the chats of other\
  \ excited trekkers and the rain ,the never ending rain.\nWalking across those moors\
  \ through the rains , that stabbed our faces like a thousand knives, had worn us\
  \ down beyond redemption.\n\n \u201CYes\u201D , \u201CWe\u2019re going to be ok\u201D\
  \ I responded, finally, shaking myself out of my reverie.\n\nYes ; the chirpy sparrows,\
  \ the endless plains ,the hauntingly beautiful grassland and grey moors and that\
  \ final view of the summit are as vividly clear as when I first saw them.\nAnd I\
  \ can\u2019t help but draw some philosophical parallels to life here , in the sense\
  \ that we may not always achieve what we set out to but the encounters we have on\
  \ the way may be just as memorable."
