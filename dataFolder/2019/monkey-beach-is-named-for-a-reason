Text: "Talking about Penang, Malaysia, some of us might immediately thought about\
  \ their culinary heaven, ranging from Char Kway Teow (stir-fried ricecake strips)\
  \ to their famous Ais Kachang (Malaysian shaved ice). I explored a bit further and\
  \ found anti-mainstream tourist attraction, Monkey Beach. Not just an ordinary beach,\
  \ Monkey Beach does not provide direct convenient access, at least for me. But,\
  \ as the saying goes, there is no such things as free lunch, right?\nFrom the city,\
  \ I take the 101 bus that dropped me right in front of Penang National Park.  There\
  \ are two ways to reach Monkey Beach from the park gate, first and the most convenient\
  \ way is to rent a boat costs 50RM, which was not an option for me. The second choice\
  \ is to hike all the way to the beach. This is where all the interesting story began.\n\
  The hike is free of charge but, one will need to register before started to hike.\
  \ Once I finished with the paperwork, I headed straight to the hiking track. While\
  \ I was expecting to feel some beachy atmosphere, I was walking into a forest. It\
  \ seemed to be quite easy at the beginning since the track is paved nicely. The\
  \ first batch of monkeys also seemed to be nice. The deeper I went, the fewer people\
  \ I bumped into and the track became more challenging. After 1 hour of trekking,\
  \ I finally reached one of the beaches, Teluk Ailing. The beach is very appealing\
  \ and since I am travelling alone, I asked 1 out of 3 people that was on the beach\
  \ to take a picture of mine. Satisfied strolling around this \u2018private beach\u2019\
  , I moved ahead to reach the destination.\nThe moment after I left Teluk Ailing,\
  \ I met the second batch of monkeys. I tried to avoid those monkeys as a precaution\
  \ since I am alone. This time, the monkeys were not so nice. One of them managed\
  \ to grab my feet, but I managed to run away from it. Thereafter, I prepared myself\
  \ with a wooden stick as my self defense weapon but luckily, I did not have to use\
  \ that until the end. I spent another one hour in the wood before arriving at Monkey\
  \ Beach.\nAll the tiring steps paid off when I reached Monkey Beach. I put down\
  \ my backpack and ordered a coconut drink while observing my surroundings. The scenery\
  \ was surreal, and it is definitely the best beach I have ever been. No one was\
  \ over-abusing the beach and the beach stand out naturally. I just could not believe\
  \ that this place exists. Again, asking for a help with an intention to get myself\
  \ captured along with those sceneries, I approached a group of family that was sunbathing.\
  \ Turned out that they are also Indonesians and we ended up chatting and exchange\
  \ stories.\nUnexpectedly, they offered me to join them on a boat ride back to the\
  \ National Park, so I would not need to walk all the way back. I really could not\
  \ hide my excitement and agreed it right away. Just in time after I finished enjoying\
  \ the beach, the pickup boat arrived. I was not allowed to enter the boat at first,\
  \ but I was relieved when they insisted that I am part of their family member, so\
  \ eventually, I was able to take the free ride. As the day cannot get better, they\
  \ even drive me to the bus stop!\nI took the same 101 bus back to the city and sit\
  \ next to a middle-aged man. I started to a conversation with him and I finally\
  \ realized that he was the guy I asked to photograph me back in Teluk Ailing. We\
  \ chatted along the way and all the sudden, we arrived at the city and I even missed\
  \ my stop. We share our contact before going back to our homestay. In the end, travelling\
  \ for me is not only about the place. It is the people that I met along the way\
  \ and the level of uncertainty that lead to an unforgettable trip."
