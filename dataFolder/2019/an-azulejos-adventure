Text: "When traveling into a country that is well known for its\u2019 culture and\
  \ ocean shores one will find many unique places to explore. This could be from the\
  \ local fresh food markets to the intricate tiles on the buildings. There are many\
  \ places on many corners that serve their specialized pastry called Past\xE9is de\
  \ Nata to the seafood inspired foods that include octopus and crab. When enjoying\
  \ the seafood take a dip into the world of vino and try the verde. Walking the cobble\
  \ sidewalks is no match for the many hills throughout the vine-like streets throughout\
  \ the city. Around every turn is a surprise because buildings tower the locals as\
  \ they weave and wind there way to work. The nightlife is just as entertaining as\
  \ the day when considering fun. There are clubs like LUX and Kapital to latenight\
  \ dinners. For example, in the LX Factory there are many places to dine. What else\
  \ would you expect to find than a all-you-can-eat sushi menu with creative options\
  \ that even include dehydrated bananas. Once you get a glimpse of this city you\u2019\
  ll never want to leave. There ate so many things to see and so many thing you\u2019\
  d want to try. Take this adventure with me and explore the unique Portugu\xE9s experience."
