Text: "Back when I was on the airplane to Chiapas, I was only excited to see its ecological\
  \ diversity: the Lacandon Jungle, the crystal blue waterfalls and the majestic Palenque\
  \ archeological site. The first stop was meant to be the Montebello Lakes, a huge\
  \ national park with at least five different colorful lagoons with only a fifteen\
  \ minute walk distance from each other. Camera? Ready. Adventurous spirit? Ready.\
  \ Weather? Not the adequate for this adventure\u2026 It was early morning and rain\
  \ was violently knocking the window of my hotel room. Our tour guide guy told us\
  \ the roads were filled with mud because of the intense rain, making it dangerous\
  \ to drive to the lagoons. It was offered to switch the activities prepared for\
  \ our last day to be the ones of our first day, after all, it doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ if it\u2019s raining where we are going now. \n\nAfter a one hour drive, the rain\
  \ is gone but it left the sky with dark grey clouds floating around. We arrive to\
  \ a small village, few houses, almost no trees and scrubland. \u201CThis is it guys,\
  \ we are in Chamula\u201D, our tour guide says, as I see through the window what\
  \ it seemed to be an abandoned ranch covered in fog, making it look more mysterious\
  \ and quite creepy. We were definitely not in the big forest and the wide jungles\
  \ we saw in the touristic pamphlets, yet I had no trouble with getting to know about\
  \ the local culture in Chiapas. We were walking to the town\u2019s church when I\
  \ saw all the local people starting their day. There they were, women wearing black\
  \ traditional shirts and dark sheepskin skirts, feeding their own black sheep in\
  \ the yard. This image definitely shocked me because the traditional Mexican clothing\
  \ is white and colorful, the pictures in the history books and movies show white\
  \ flowery shirts, I never even thought about the possibility of a black design.\
  \ This randomness perhaps is what hooked me right at the beginning.\n\nThen we headed\
  \ to a colorful big church with crosses and butterflies inside green squares, where\
  \ they asked us not to take pictures inside. \u201CWe believe cameras absorb the\
  \ energy for the rituals\u201D a guard outside the church said. A square box that\
  \ sucks up all the essence of a moment by capturing it in a picture? Yes, I knew\
  \ that\u2019s what a camera does, in a poetic way. I never took it so literal until\
  \ that day. That much respect to the spiritual made me realize sometimes I can be\
  \ more present on what is going on than just focusing on taking a good picture.\
  \ \nAl thought I have no pictures of it, my memories are vivid, probably because\
  \ I focused my attention on remembering all. To this day I visit this place in my\
  \ head, the many rituals taking place at the same time with colored candles that\
  \ would make figures as they melted on the floor. As soon as the colors of the wax\
  \ would collide to each other, a message was written, the expression of relief on\
  \ people\u2019s faces\u2026 As if they were reading a message, but no letters on\
  \ it, just melting colors. It was all about interpretation, everything being so\
  \ intuitive. I\u2019ve battled with being spiritual but not religious, not identifying\
  \ with the practices of my family\u2019s church. It was a relief to experience the\
  \ Chamula\u2019s rituals, a mix of all that is in tune with your own beliefs, trusting\
  \ your instinct and still using all sort of religious objects such as candles, to\
  \ create your own authentic relationship with the spiritual.\n\nThe cemetery close\
  \ to the church had the graves of their loved ones covered with plants, flowers\
  \ grow above the piece of land where their gone relatives rest their bodies. They\
  \ tend to grow up so tall because they are aiming to the sky, they want to help\
  \ the dead reach heaven. This way of celebrating death with life resonated even\
  \ more to me, it is their people and their culture, their devotion to the spiritual,\
  \ what makes visitors like me to experience a sensitive journey."
