Text: "Please, keep in mind this sentence... \"stardust\". \nMeanwhile, let me tell\
  \ you about my last trip. This time I went to Holbox, an island in the mexican caribean,\
  \ it\xB4s not only beautufil, is the home of the sharkwhales. \nThe island have\
  \ 3 principal atractions: 1.The sharkwhale, 2.Flamingos and 3.Bioluminiscence. The\
  \ last one was our goal.\n I went with 2 of my favorite girls in the world, but\
  \ we were in a \"no expensive, we have no money\" trip, so... \nOur adventure began\
  \ in Playa del Carmen. We drove from there to Chiquil\xE1 2hours ish. When we arrived,\
  \ we took the ferri to cross to the island. It takes only 20min to get there. While\
  \ you cross the ocean, with a bit of luck, you can see dolphins. Even if you don\xB4\
  t see them you can bet you gonna love the view.\nOnce we where in the Island we\
  \ were traying to find our camping... we stayed in a tent. First we walked to the\
  \ downtown and asking here and there to figured out that we have to took a golf\
  \ car. \nOnce in the camping area we walked about 15min to the beach called Punta\
  \ Cocos. It\xB4s so amazing! in the shore was only a \"palapa\" with \"camastros\"\
  \ and cocktels and inside the ocean there are some \"hamacas\" when you can take\
  \ very nice pics. \nWe walked a litte in the shore. We saw a baby stingray and a\
  \ lot of pelicans and albatros flying over the sea. \nBut lets go to the point...\
  \ in the night we took courage (it was soooo dark \xB4cause there was no light \
  \ from our camping to the beach)  and walked again to the shore to see the bioluminiscence,\
  \ there was our ADVENTURE, walked in the night only with the light of our cellphones\
  \ and trough a lot of puddles, wondering about if in the next step we gonna get\
  \ stocked because we didnt know how deep the puddles are or if we gonna found an\
  \ aligator or something..Imagine that, there was NO light at all, neither moon light,\
  \ it was new moon. \nNext scene: we have a puddle so long and deep infront of us\
  \ and we are asking us if we countinue or we get back to where we once belong (sorry,\
  \ beatles lover). There was no other way to reach the shore and over all the island\
  \ were puddles and water because a week later there has been a storm. So there we\
  \ are.. asking why the planet spin and then... we see a light coming up  from the\
  \ puddle and asking if we were lost.. It was a golfcar!! they crossed the puddle\
  \ and ask us if we know where they can see the bio so, we made a deal, we tell us\
  \ where and they pickup us there...\n\nFinally we were there..!! so, we ran into\
  \ the sea and splashed the water to move it and see the bio.. we were so amazed\
  \ about what we saw. There were blue lights every where we moved the water, was\
  \ like we had a light in our hands and body, it\xB4s was sooo amazing and fun.\n\
  We were about one hour making the sea shine and shine, wondering how all of those\
  \ plancton can iluminate the ocean like that, hopping that no one sea animal bite\
  \ us, and telling us how incredible it was. The water was so warm, the sky was clean\
  \ and full of stars, it was so quite because no one was there. The tipical tour\
  \ take you over other part of the island so we were alone, just six of us.\n\nPerhaps\
  \ now you are thinking  \"oh I get it! the bio is like stars in the water\"! Well\
  \ maybe it is, but this would be a clich\xE9... nop,  I asked you to keep in mind\
  \ stardust \xB4cause, I am so wonder about the fact that all in the universe is\
  \ made of stardust and all the shapes that stardust has taken. So, if all in this\
  \ world is made of stardust, This island is my favorite stardust in the hole world,\
  \  \xB4till I found another stardust shape over there more interesting and magic\
  \ than that one..."
