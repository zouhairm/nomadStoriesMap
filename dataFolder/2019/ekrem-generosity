Text: "\u201CWe could add another island and go straight to Greece,\u201D I suggested,\
  \ trying - and failing- to keep a hint of desperation out of my voice. The incessant\
  \ texts from my parents begging me to re-route, coupled with the constant news stories\
  \ blaring from the TV in every cafe I visited, had pushed my anxiety to almost unbearable.\
  \ \n\nDespite my apprehensions being completely justifiable and rational, my boyfriend\
  \  was adamant. \u201CIstanbul has been on my list to visit forever,\u201D he said.\
  \ It didn\u2019t seem to phase him that the Atat\xFCrk Airport had been fatally\
  \ and horrifically bombed less than 24 hours prior.\n\nThree hours later, fighting\
  \ back tears (on my end), we boarded the overnight bus from Bulgaria. Us and three\
  \ other people, on a bus that accommodated 105.\n\nAlthough nearly empty, the bus\
  \ felt cramped. To make matters worse, I spent the majority of the time giving (and\
  \ receiving) the silent treatment from the person who was supposed to comfort me\
  \ the most.\n\nFast forward three days, I never thought my boyfriend\u2019s stubbornness\
  \ would be a trait I would come to be so grateful for, and I was ashamed of my own\
  \ close mindedness. \n\nAs the only guests in our entire hostel, Ekrem, the son\
  \ of the owner, took it upon himself to be our personal tour guide, but he quickly\
  \ became much more than that. Young, bright, humorous and one of the most genuinely\
  \ kind people I had ever met, spending time with Ekrem gave me an overwhelming feeling\
  \ of guilt for the assumptions I had made about his country. \n\nWe walked through\
  \ the deserted aisles of the Grand Bazaar one day, Ekrem sadly explaining that at\
  \ this time last year you could barely move through the seas of people. Despite\
  \ the increasing desperation of the local stall owners, we were met with the utmost\
  \ hospitality as Ekrem\u2019s family and friends showered us with local samples\
  \ and invited us to partake in their traditions. People with nearly nothing were\
  \ willing to give everything they had to make sure we saw their home the way they\
  \ did: as home.\n\nOn our second last day in Istanbul I let my privilege slip out\
  \ and talked about how \u201Cawful\u201D the bus ride had been and how I was dreading\
  \ getting back on. Ekram, who we later found out had lost a close friend less than\
  \ 72 hours before in the attack, not only listened but empathized with me. Me! Complaining\
  \ about a 13 hour bus ride. He genuinely regarded my experience as a struggle to\
  \ me, and did not compare, judge, scoff or mention how he had it worse.\n\nAfter\
  \ the attack I had been terrified to come to an unstable, war-stricken zone. Logically,\
  \ my fears were at least partially rational. It was a vulnerable area with political\
  \ unrest. However, I neglected to dig deeper. I assumed headlines of horror would\
  \ translate to constantly feeling unsafe. I imagined all of the people I would encounter\
  \ would be distraught, unwelcoming and angry. I believe I felt this way because\
  \ that\u2019s how I would think I would feel. If I had skipped Turkey I likely never\
  \ would have looked back, marking it with a black X on any future travel itineraries.\n\
  \nInstead, I was dragged outside of my comfort zone and I met some of the most compassionate,\
  \ caring people I ever have and my mind has been forever opened. I embraced a culture\
  \ I knew nothing about, nor, to be completely transparent, cared much about. The\
  \ lifestyle I participated in surely differs from my own, but the hearts of those\
  \ living it does not. \n\nI still talk with Ekrem almost every day - although distance\
  \ separates us now, we still have the easy rapport I developed with him soon after\
  \ meeting. We reminisce of my short time in Turkey,  make plans to reunite and confide\
  \ in one another about nearly everything.\n\nOn my final day in Istanbul I meditated\
  \ to the sunrise with Ekram and his family, surrounded by the stunning architecture\
  \ of the Blue Mosque. As I did so I, ironically, in this war-torn country, had never\
  \ felt more at peace."
