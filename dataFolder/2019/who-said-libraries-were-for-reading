Text: "'Follow your nose' is a common piece of advice given to the adventurous, the\
  \ curious and... the hungry. \nSo, for once, I did just that. Following your nose\
  \ in Paris will lead you one of two routes, to one of the many bakeries smelling\
  \ of fresh bread and flaky, buttery pastries and displaying the most delicately\
  \ decorated patisseries, to the smell of warm tobacco and a group of very stylish\
  \ teenagers who are casually thrown against a graffiti mural about to head to a\
  \ Happy Hour. \n\nThis time, I followed my nose and I found myself wandering down\
  \ cobbled, uneven streets, pretending and hoping I gave the illusion that I knew\
  \ where I was going (and that I could keep my balance), without staring down at\
  \ the ground like a lost soul. The sounds of French political discussion and nonchalant\
  \ rants about tourists and taxis could be heard in the distance, all weaving into\
  \ one cloud of noise as I carried on walking to reach a queue of people who had\
  \ poured onto the street. It was crepes. No wonder there was such a queue. I patiently\
  \ waited and observed as the lady behind the counter took two euros and began pouring\
  \ batter onto a hot plate and smoothly flipping it in one movement before lathering\
  \ it with dollops of Nutella. \n\nI took the crepe, the tissue that it was wrapped\
  \ in was not enough of a barrier as it warmed the palms of my hands up and I began\
  \ walking down the road further. Accompanied by the mix of pastries, wine (it was\
  \ now past 16.00), crepes, Nutella and of course, le fromage, I escaped down a narrow\
  \ path that looked to be leading somewhere grandiose. Of course, walking down narrow,\
  \ un-signposted paths in the dark would ring a million alarm bells. But this was\
  \ Paris and I had my Nutella crepe with me. \n\nDown through this road that was\
  \ coated in cigarette butts, I was beginning to regret my decision and turn back\
  \ to the hustling, bustling streets filled with hungry teenagers when I looked up\
  \ and saw it. A huge, white-coloured building surrounding in a tall metal gate and\
  \ christened with a dome and spire to add to its grandiosity. The Panth\xE9on. I\
  \ walked in front of it, marvelling at the sheer size and beauty of its unique architecture\
  \ when I finally looked all around me. I was surrounded by huge limescale giants\
  \ embellished with Latin signs and doors that stretched to the height of 4th floor\
  \ of the apartments in the next door streets. \nAs I continued to walk, the French\
  \ dictionary in my head was making tenuous links between the odd word that I was\
  \ hearing and seeing before I came across another queue. Having been blessed with\
  \ the food of the Gods, which was currently running down the sides of my mouth,\
  \ I knew that I had to jump onto this queue as well. \nI quickly finished off the\
  \ last triangle of crepe and disposed of the tissue, wiping the corners of my mouth\
  \ and brushing down my coat. I was going to the library. Biblioth\xE8que Sainte-Genevi\xE8\
  ve is not really a library. Well, it is, but it is also so much more. \nIt is a\
  \ gallery, a museum, a social space, a masterpiece. The doors were heavy but so\
  \ lavishly detailed in engravings that I forgave them for my difficult entrance.\
  \ Greeted by a grumpy security guard, (bienvenue a Paris), I was bag-searched before\
  \ entering into a reception area of ancient relics and paintings, with the antique\
  \ chairs and a polished marble staircase just begging to be walked on, I could not\
  \ contain my excitement. \nAfter having been interviewed and given a card with my\
  \ awkward, yet excited face printed on it, I was finally granted access to one of\
  \ the most surreal, peaceful and beautiful places I had ever been in. \nThe smell\
  \ of oak and freshly cut paper filled my nostrils, sounds of pages being turned\
  \ delicately and 7 foot bookshelves full of catalogues with leather-bound novels\
  \ engulfed me. Beautiful emerald lights delicately hung from the ceiling and cascaded\
  \ down onto the long, royal tables. \nI did not want to leave."
