Text: "This is the only Arab country without petrol. It is expensive especially to\
  \ marry.\nThe young man shares with the female part of the family - sisters or cousins\
  \ - and they take on the task of first investigating whether the girl is not engaged.\n\
  If the girl is free, then there is a \"feminine\" approach. If they do not know\
  \ each other, the groom's close women find a way to get to know the girl, to become\
  \ friends and invite them to visit. Meanwhile, it has been mentioned that besides\
  \ all other relatives (they like to highlight those in a high position and in good\
  \ standing) they have a brother who is super.\nThe ladies go and carry their chosen\
  \ little gifts, among them nuts - they give her to eat to see if she has healthy\
  \ teeth (the Jordanians have bad teeth because they do not go to a dentist because\
  \ it is expensive, also the care of the teeth is not very widespread). With such\
  \ gifts, the girl now understands what they are looking for and, according to her\
  \ desire, she can perform well or makes a bad impression if she does not want to\
  \ get married.\nIf things go smoothly, it follows the second season of the marriage\
  \ saga: women tell their brother that there is hope and he already talks to the\
  \ family that he has decided to marry. This is an important family matter because\
  \ it is all related to a lot of expenses that are made by the groom's family. In\
  \ Jordan, the dowry is provided by a male side, and this is not the bride's purchase.\
  \ This ransom or dowry consists of money, jewelery, camels, or maybe a car and a\
  \ dwelling that is not given to the bride's father as a ransom, and remains for\
  \ the girl. \nAn official message is sent to the female side and a favorable third\
  \ season follows: The bride's family invites the most important and successful people\
  \ of both genera in one place. This is a camp or a big hall in a hotel because these\
  \ VIPs can be 1000-1500 people! A ritual with drinking a small cup of coffee with\
  \ cardamom is done - the host offers the guest's cup and he drinks it at the ex,\
  \ which shows that he accepts the hospitality and everything is fine. They ask the\
  \ girl if she wants to marry, and her answer must be clearly heard, for the sheik,\
  \ by writing the marriage certificate, will write that the woman has agreed and\
  \ there are witnesses for it. All these are circuses, because at this stage it is\
  \ already known that there will be a wedding, but these rituals are obligatory.\n\
  Then everyone enjoys drinking coffee and negotiating a marriage contract. It is\
  \ very important because there are other issues besides the dowry, such as a divorce.\
  \ For example, if a man wants a divorce, he has to pay his wife 10,000 dinars. If\
  \ a woman wants a divorce it will still take some amount, but it will be symbolic.\n\
  It is celebrated for a whole week - men and women separately - and the last day\
  \ is a very good mansaf dish, and then the bride and groom are donated - mostly\
  \ money. The gifts are recorded carefully, but not for the guest to account for\
  \ how much he has given. The thing is that when your uncle came and gave you, for\
  \ example, 1000 dinars, after inviting you to such an event, your gift should be\
  \ bigger, albeit a little. It is very shameful to give less and so it is recorded\
  \ who has given it the next time he invites you, you open your notebook and look\
  \ at: aaaa Uncle Ali gave me 1,000 dinars - I will prepare 1100. Other is shame\
  \ and horror and \"what people will say. \" Because of this, \"what people will\
  \ say\" the cost of weddings is rising and for many men it is a problem to get married.\
  \ \nI did not understand what the Jordanian standard of living. They do not make\
  \ the impression of rich, but apparently have enough money to play the game\"Jordanian\
  \ Wedding\"."
