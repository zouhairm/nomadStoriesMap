Text: "The wind licked my bare thighs and whistled softly into my ears pushed down\
  \ by a silicone cap. It was so cold outside I was internally self-warming. The sea\
  \ water, steely and calm lay before me. Not welcoming, not repelling, just being.\
  \ There. I approached, droplets running down my legs, bringing fleshy goose\u2019\
  s skin to the surface. It was February in Finland, standing on the shore of the\
  \ Port of Helsinki, staring down at the sea pool in nothing but my wet swimsuit\
  \ and cap, drenched in determination.\n\nYou see, I just spent the prior week swimming\
  \ 6km (3.7miles) a day in the fjords of Oman \u2013 different time zone, different\
  \ continent, and definitely a different climate, but a trip that boosted my self-confidence\
  \ like no other. So, while researching the second leg of my trip, a two-week Scandinavian\
  \ adventure, I couldn\u2019t help but be lulled by the call of the Alas Sea Pool.\
  \ I bought my wristband, swam a few ceremonial lengths in the heated lap pool, all\
  \ as a preamble to this, the freezing waters of the Gulf of Finland. But, as was\
  \ typical when I ventured away from the pack, a small group of followers formed\
  \ in my wake.\n\nYes, the change in wind must\u2019ve signaled to a select few that\
  \ it was time to leave the comforts of the heated pool and plunge into the icy waters.\
  \ I knew it was my moment. Deliberately I stepped down the wooden planks. Deliberately\
  \ enough to allow the rise, the rush, the pins and needles tingle of freezing water\
  \ to penetrate my feet, my ankles. Up my calves, and then my knees, before my fight\
  \ or flight kicked in and I was back up on the deck in a blink.\n\nTwo young men\
  \ brushed by in a mumble of Finnish; one immediately determined to swim in hope\
  \ that perpetual motion would keep his muscles and bones from cryogenically fusing,\
  \ the other treaded, mustache above water, teeth chattering. As I spectated, my\
  \ lower legs screamed as they came to, lulled out of their instinctual numbness\
  \ by the wicked winter wind. After a full lap, a minute or two of treading, the\
  \ men were out, stumbling towards the sauna \u2013 this was Finland after all!\n\
  \nUp next, a petite young Asian woman, bikini-clad and timid. Unsure of our potential\
  \ for a shared spoken language, we mostly gazed empathetically at one another intermixed\
  \ with fearful glances at the frigid waters. She made it about as deep as I did\
  \ and in half the time \u2013 in a Flash. In her initial defeat, she decided to\
  \ join me as a momentary onlooker and we didn\u2019t have to wait long. As Flash\
  \ emerged, a round Finnish woman, also donning a bikini, jaunted down the rubber\
  \ mat path and grasped the metal railings with delight. Without hesitation she walked\
  \ down the planks as one would down their childhood back porch steps, a glide of\
  \ familiarity. Flash and I watched on in awe \u2013 would her body\u2019s knee jerk\
  \ reaction give her away?\n\nAbsolutely not! She continued until she was submerged\
  \ save her head and hands. \u201CYou\u2019re brave!\u201D \u2013 the words escaped\
  \ my lips before I could think them. She smiled \u201COh, I come here all the time.\
  \ Stay in for at least 10 full seconds and always keep my head and hands out.\u201D\
  \ Her Finnish accent made her approachable, humble. If she can do this, my competitive\
  \ brain already hard at work with a pep talk, then I can do this!\n\nTen seconds\
  \ were up and she was out and into her towel. Flash and I gave each other an \u201C\
  ok, but who goes first\u201D glance, before I took the railings \u201CHere goes\
  \ nothing!\u201D I was even more determined, quickly before my lizard brain could\
  \ override my desire for experience, for exhilaration, for circulation! I\u2019\
  m in! I\u2019m IN!! I\u2019M IN!!! And before I knew it, I\u2019m half choking on\
  \ seawater, and I\u2019m out! But I\u2019m proud! With a smile and a pump of my\
  \ arm into the air, I\u2019m celebrating and walking the wobbly path to sauna time\
  \ \u2013 where I\u2019m looking forward to feeling the heat from the hell in Helsinki!"
