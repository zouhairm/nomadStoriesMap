Text: "I wish the youthful courage that drove me to India never leave me. Rishkesh\
  \ is a city crossed by the Ganges and shaded by the Himalayas. After working on\
  \ a social project, far from any tourist destination, I was exploring India. From\
  \ New Delhi to Rishkesh by car, on the highway\u2019s final kilometers , many ads\
  \ of Y\xF4ga's schools and teachers, all modest compared to the billboards of the\
  \ International Y\xF4ga Festival (IYF). I realized it was starting that very day.\
  \ Everything happens close to the bridges that cross the Ganges through the heights,\
  \ just beside monkeys and cows. Following the little street beside the Ganges, a\
  \ huge statue of Shiva emerges over the waters where the opening of the festival\
  \ was taking place that evening. Teachers with white beards, children holding candles\
  \ and vocalizing mantras, all using orange clothes. At the end of the ceremony,\
  \ everyone goes to an iron gate. Dozens of European faces with bracelets, which\
  \ I had already observed during the ceremony, identified the participants of the\
  \ event with access to the Ashram (Y\xF4ga institution). I asked for information\
  \ and found myself facing large dollar amount and then I considered the program\
  \ canceled.\n\nI continued practicing Y\xF4ga, paid in rupees, which was more fitting\
  \ for me. Two days were enough for me to love Rishkesh and decided to cancel the\
  \ plan to meet any other city. My friend came back to Brazil and I went to a cheaper\
  \ hostel. After initially not knowing what to expect from this city, it became my\
  \ favorite place in India, and I still didn\u2019t know the best was yet to come.\
  \ We walk in the opposite direction of the most popular places. There was a highway\
  \ up the mountain with a beautiful view of the Ganges. We passed a small dirt road,\
  \ a steep ascent of stones, from which came what we perceived to be workers in a\
  \ quarry and, surprisingly, two tourists that we had already crossed somewhere.\
  \ We asked what this road led, they said for us to check it out by ourselves that\
  \ we certainly wouldn\u2019t regret it. The rocky dirt road through the middle of\
  \ the woods was becoming more narrow and tiring but the mountain weather was very\
  \ pleasant. The amount of trees increases, we were already on a trail and the noise\
  \ of water fits perfectly in this walk. We saw a first small waterfall, but as the\
  \ trail still followed upstream, we continued, we found a bigger waterfall of two\
  \ falls, those pure waters came from mountains and ran straight to the Ganges River.\
  \ It really was a purification and energizing bath.\nIn a crowded restaurant I received\
  \ an invitation to share the table, with four beautiful women, they had arabic faces\
  \ and north american english. They also had bracelets from the International Y\xF4\
  ga Festival. We talked a lot, one of them was a festival teacher. I was asked if\
  \ I knew anything good about the city because they hadn\u2019t left the Ashram until\
  \ then. I was amazed. I thought of all the wonderful things I had ever known, and\
  \ I said just enough to arrange a trail to the waterfalls with them the next day.\
  \ I had never imagined feeling at the same time a tourist and guide in India but\
  \ that was exactly what happened. During the day I noticed that one of them spent\
  \ the day texting on the phone. At the end of the day, she said she would go back\
  \ to Los Angeles that night, took off the festival access bracelet and handed it\
  \ to me. So I entered the event, with lodging and access to all practices. The next\
  \ day, the class of one of the girls who was a teacher, as we became super friends\
  \ she asked me to stay well ahead. It was as if we were longtime friends, as if\
  \ that place had always been our home and surrounded by best friends. The fact of\
  \ living with an open heart and receptive to the place and the people provided this\
  \ wonderful experience, which I really didn\u2019t expect to find."
