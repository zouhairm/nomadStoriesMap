Text: "Changing environment sometimes help you to go through the hardest part in your\
  \ life. Living as a right thalamic lesion patient is not so easy as I thought. But\
  \ at least when I decide to further study abroad everything is a new for me. I can\
  \ breathe a bit. Study and travel makes me valuing every single day of my life here.\
  \  I never been imagining I get an opportunity to travel around Europe because I\
  \ don\u2019t have extra money. All of my expenses is just to cover my medication,\
  \ spend some stuff for my parents and my little brother. No excess money to pampered\
  \ myself. I believe in nature, after the rain, rainbow appeared. Yes, that\u2019\
  s true.\n\nI have been selected as a European Union scholarship holder for one of\
  \ the master program in Erasmus after apply second time in 2 years. I don\u2019\
  t have time to learn German language before I come here due to pack schedule of\
  \ government project which I had been involved. At the same time, I have other responsibility\
  \ to my family because my sister in law run away for my elder brother\u2019s home.\
  \ So her kids always ask me to come over when I travel for business in east Malaysia.\
  \ I have been so exhausted carry too much burden in my shoulder. So I accept the\
  \ offer from EU as a reason to escape from my old tiring life. Like killing bird\
  \ with one stone, I enhance my knowledge in spatial field at the same time enjoy\
  \ travelling around Europe. \nActually I don\u2019t think that I have passion on\
  \ travel at the first time. I just feel enthusiasm looking at the people, learn\
  \ their language, culture and food. The most important thing that I realize when\
  \ I am travel is I can ignore my illness symptoms. I can skip my prescription, without\
  \ worry about dizziness and seizures on left part of my body. Is sound good right?\
  \ You have to think to survive in new environment and challenge your skill of surviving\
  \ until you forget about your critical illness.  That is how I survive here. \n\n\
  In almost one and half year, I have been travel in 11 different countries, Greece,\
  \ Austria, Hungary, Bratislava, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Slovakia, Slovenia,\
  \ Poland and Czech Republic. From all of this countries, what the things that I\
  \ haven\u2019t expect to find is, how open Bulgarian people toward the religion.\
  \ All of the worship building in close to each other and it makes me so amazed at\
  \ the first time I am arrived there. Jewish synagogue, is located at the back of\
  \ central market, while the mosque is also nearby that area as well as the orthodox\
  \ cathedral. All of them are really big. I am Malaysian and everybody know that\
  \ we have multi races and multi religion. But it was the first time I saw all of\
  \ the worship building is huge, close to each other and it was in the city center.\
  \  For me I thought that foreign country is not so open about religion, especially\
  \ in western, but my prejudice change when I arrived in Sophia, Bulgaria."
