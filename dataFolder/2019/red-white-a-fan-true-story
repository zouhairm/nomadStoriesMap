Text: "December 9, 2018\nMadrid, Spain\nIt was four days ago that I left Buenos Aires,\
  \ Wednesday 5th. Relevant? Yes. It was my birthday, and not any but my fifty years\
  \ one. There was no cake, there was no  candles. I decided to fly that same day.\n\
  It would be my fifth time in Madrid. But this time it would be different. \nMadrid\
  \ were no the city where I \xB4d have been before. Because of Mary Virgen Day, the\
  \ government declared a four-day holiday weekend, so many people of the city and\
  \ from other smaller cities were free time. With Christmas oncoming, were all in\
  \ the streets, in the big stores, at he Christmas stuff market at Plaza Mayor. People\
  \ with Santa hats, reindeer horns headbands with colorful led lights on their heads.\
  \  It surprised me, cause in Argentina, people cares about not getting in ridiculous.\
  \  Xmas atmosphere was present... in people, at the stores windows, in the avenues,\
  \ at the walking streets.\nThere was no vacancy at the hostels, neither hotels.\
  \ \nWalking from \"Plaza del Sol\" to \"Plaza Mayor\", a ten minutes walk, it takes\
  \ twenty or more. People here, people there, people everywhere. Unbelievable!\n\
  Every \"Bar de Tapeo\" was crowded, impossible to get in.  Madrid was overflowed,\
  \ like I never had seen.\nBut, back to today. Time: past 11 pm. Place: Plaza del\
  \ Sol. The square was full again, but this time, it was a yelling crowd. Red and\
  \ white colors dye the whole place. Umbrellas, flags, caps, beanies, t-shirts, scarfs,\
  \ jackets with a thing in common, the colors red and white. They were not waiting\
  \ for the Noche Vieja (last night of the year). They were celebrating, I was celebrating.\
  \ Our soccer team River Plate had won The Final. The dreamed one, the most important\
  \ final in the history of the Club. of the Cup itself, and in front were the longlife\
  \ rival team, so it makes it more pleasant. The match ended 3-1. And after the coronation\
  \ in the field of the Bernabeu Stadium, as it just was known,  the meeting point,\
  \ the celebration place was Sol. I took the metro (subway) like everybody else.\
  \ And the \"party\" goes on. At the platform, at the wagons, at the mechanical stair\
  \ til Sol station was an unique voice of the crowd singing. At Sol, there were drums\
  \ and drummers, making the tempo of the songs. I was there til four thirty with\
  \ all my soul mates. The happier day of my life was ending. The fourteen hours flight,\
  \ the worst hostel in the world, it didn\xB4t care. It was an historical fact, and\
  \ I were there.\nNext morning,  I tattooed my left upper arm. The elected drawing\
  \ was Madrid symbol \" the bear standing leaning on a madro\xF1o tree\", but the\
  \ Libertadores Cup trophy in the tree place. A trip for remembering, for story telling.\
  \ Like Sinatra\xB4s song \"I\xB4ve got Madrid under my skin\" for Eternity"
