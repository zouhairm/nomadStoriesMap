Text: "A balloon billowed half deflated before me. \n\nAll morning I had squinted\
  \ through the dim, trying to willpower it into the air.\n\nI ignored my frostbitten\
  \ toes by conjuring those Instagram images I had seen a hundred times \u2013 a pastel\
  \ sky sprinkled with hot air balloons, each gracefully drifting over an alien landscape\u2026\
  \n\nThis was the scene that dragged me out of bed before dawn and sent me, bundled\
  \ in more layers than a babushka doll, up the hillside above G\xF6reme. \n\nHow\
  \ could I come to Cappadocia and not experience the iconic hot air balloons? This\
  \ was a bucket list essential.\n\nBut as morning light splintered over the horizon,\
  \ the sky remained stubbornly empty. \n\nOverall-clad figures rolled up the remaining\
  \ puddle of balloon \u2013 for the third morning in a row. \n\t\n-------\n\nI have\
  \ an uncanny ability to \u2018miss\u2019 key moments when travelling. \n\nYou know\
  \ the ones; those 'must-see' moments and monuments. The experiences canonised into\
  \ the holy Traveller\u2019s Bucket List through countless sun-soaked images splashed\
  \ over in-flight magazines, TripAdvisor feeds and that wanderlust-inducing blog\
  \ of a mate now on their fourth gap year. \n\nI want to cross these moments off\
  \ my bucket list as much as everyone else. But my timing is always, impeccably off.\
  \  \n\nI arrive at that World Heritage site during a raging rainstorm (looking at\
  \ you Plitvice Lakes), or when the mountain peak is engulfed by impenetrable cloud\
  \ (really, Triglav?). The camera breaks at that iconic photo opportunity (but it's\
  \ Uluru!), or the architectural wonder is under scaffolding (just a little peek,\
  \ Trevi fountain?). \n\nThe first-world indignation is felt acutely in these moments.\
  \ How dare this city or the weather thwart my travel itinerary!?\n\nI know, it\u2019\
  s embarrassing. I forget it\u2019s the unyielding nature of these \u2018wonders\u2019\
  \ that makes them so desirable in the first place. They stand for centuries in total\
  \ apathy to human comings-and-goings, and bucket list ticking. \n\n----\n\nOn the\
  \ hillside, a stray dog nuzzled my hand for a pat. With a sigh, I begun to retrace\
  \ my steps to town. \n\nG\xF6reme was rumbling to life. Cars crawled through hotels\
  \ and cave houses. The fairy chimneys stood rimmed in a strange, silver glow. The\
  \ final notes of the call to prayer echoed through the valley. \n\nMy sleep-deprived\
  \ reverie was only broken by something wet falling on my cheek. \n\nThen my earlobe.\
  \ \n\nThen my other cheek. \n\nOf course, I thought, all this day needs is rain!\
  \ \n\nBut as I dithered on the spot debating where to run, I noticed the rain wasn\u2019\
  t falling. It was fluttering.  \n\nFluffy confetti tumbled down, while a primal\
  \ feeling bubbled up.\n\nWas this anger? Was I going to be sick?!\n\nThe sensation\
  \ gripped my stomach, pushed up my chest and against my lips until \u2026 I laughed.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain the wondrous effect snow has on Australians, like\
  \ myself. I could count the number of times I\u2019ve witnessed snowfall on one\
  \ hand. \n\nI begun to twirl around the street like an over-grown child.\n\nI peeled\
  \ off my hood and let flakes catch in my hair, my eyelashes, my open palms. I grinned\
  \ and stared and whirled and frolicked as the sky crumbled around me. \n\nThis was\
  \ the reason the balloons hadn\u2019t flown that morning! Beautiful, ordinary snow.\
  \ \n\n----\n\nMost of my treasured travel moments happen in the wake of all the\
  \ ones I think I\u2019ve missed. \n\nIt was the moment a kind Croatian man handed\
  \ me a steaming cuppa that day in Plitvice Lakes, because I looked like a drowned\
  \ cat. \n\nIt was the dinner I shared with a Turkish family and their rescue kitten,\
  \ Tequila, after I got lost on my way to Uchisar fortress. \n\nIt was the inconsolable\
  \ laughter of my friend and I as we tossed a coin into the inflatable pool outside\
  \ the Trevi fountain. \n\nYou won\u2019t find these experiences on any bucket lists.\
  \ They fall in the cracks of your itinerary. Unscripted, unexpected, and sometimes\
  \ wholly undignified. But somehow, these imperfections render them even more novel,\
  \ and meaningful. \n\nI can\u2019t pretend that I still don\u2019t chase bucket\
  \ list moments, but I mind less when I miss them now. \n\nInstead, I look out for\
  \ those 'snowflake' moments, small and fleeting, and too beautifully ordinary for\
  \ any bucket list."
