Text: "To travel to a place unknown isn't just about the discovery found in the layers\
  \ of a destination. I've come to find that it has even more to do with discovering\
  \ more of yourself. To be frank, I didn't truly come to understand the deeper intrinsic\
  \ value of travel, intentionality, and how they intersect until I overcame the obstacle\
  \ of facing my own mortality... twice. And what further impacts the intentionality\
  \ is not just overcoming the obstacles, but rather the gentle reminder that life\
  \ is short and tomorrow is not guaranteed. \n\nThe first time I finished my chemotherapy,\
  \ I had the perspective of relief. The last time I went through my chemotherapy\
  \ (5 years after my initial one), my perspective shifted to one of a deep sense\
  \ of gratitude for life and how precious each day was. After being sick, I decided\
  \ that one of my objectives in life was going to be to travel and see as many places\
  \ in the world as I could. I decided to start with the United States, where I was\
  \ already based. I would proactively schedule, plan, and literally map out ways\
  \ to see as many different cities as I could. This led me to visit over 70 cities\
  \ over the past 4 years, using the foundation of live music to do so. Intentionality\
  \ became my guiding light. I would use each of my five senses to take in the culture,\
  \ the people, the food, and the libations of a city and its environment. What better\
  \ way is there to connect with people if not music, food, and drinks? \n\nI SAW\
  \ the the vividness of colors against the backdrop of a New York City skyline and\
  \ the tapestry of historic buildings in Fargo, North Dakota. I HEARD the differences\
  \ between live music venues in loud rock halls in Austin, TX to the more quieter\
  \ top-lines of an acoustic song in Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, TN. I I also experienced\
  \ the differences between Boston accents heard in conversation over an oyster happy\
  \ hour and the midwest accents heard while feasting on Chicago deep dish pizza at\
  \ Lou Malnati's. I got to SMELL the aroma of Stumptown coffee in Portland, OR as\
  \ well as the wafting smell of Mexican street tacos in Los Angeles. I FELT the wind\
  \ and the water while tubing on Leech lake in Northern Minnesota and also felt the\
  \ frigid coldness of snowfall in Akron, Ohio. I was able to TASTE the leather undertones\
  \ of an expensive glass of cabernet sauvignon at a winery in Napa Valley to the\
  \ Islay-like peaty mouthfeel of a Single Malt Scotch made in Seattle, WA. I tasted\
  \ truly al dente risotto in an authentic Northern Italian hole-in-the-wall restaurant\
  \ in Baltimore, Maryland. \n\nI realized that by being intentional with my senses,\
  \ I didn't need to take pictures of my food to remember them. I could sit in a moment\
  \ and let it fill into my entire being. My next goal in life is to take this approach\
  \ internationally. Once you go abroad, the differences in cultures becomes that\
  \ much more apparent. The differences in even how food is prepared, how wine or\
  \ coffee is grown, and how meals are enjoyed communally changes drastically. And\
  \ that excites me. Life is so full of beauty and the majority of us don't even capture\
  \ the tip of the iceberg. It is my hope to continue to use writing, music, my love\
  \ of food & drinks, and INTENTIONALITY to inspire and challenge others to truly\
  \ appreciate travel and how it can serve as a vessel of self discovery."
