Text: 'Leaving Kampot early in the morning, I jump on a Bus. 6 hours of bus ride was
  like a Roller coaster ride, indeed you need not go to a theme park over here as
  public transport or driving on the roads is about as exhilarating, or scary. The
  Bus bounced its way around like a pin ball before eventually breaking down 4km from
  the border into Thailand. Cows crossing the rd looked at us with dull eyes that
  said they had seen it all before. slowing grazing their cud.


  Giving up on the bus, we change into a taxi to get to the border. Several stern
  looking military men with rifles usher us through, staring at us in suspicion momentarily
  before stamping our passports. We get across the border otherwise uneventfully and
  jump in a minivan bound for Bangkok.


  8 hours of being locked in the back of a van packed full of people and packs, all
  steaming from the heat. though it stopped several times for the driver to have a
  pee stop or cig break only once did he let us out of our cramped steel prison. Though
  I did try jump out the window once. However 14 hours after leaving Kampot we arrived
  in Bangkok. the huge cost of $33 for bus trip, $1 a bottle of water, and a very
  relieving Pee at the end....'
