Text: "My story theme is all of the above: A leap into the unknown, Making a local\
  \ connection, and I didn't expect to find.\n\n I arrived in Tokyo, Japan on March\
  \ 20, 2015. I was 18; the greenest I have ever felt. I had never traveled alone,\
  \ certainly not outside the country! I had dreams and power within me willing to\
  \ do the work to succeed in this new environment though. I call it grit.  I arrived\
  \ at my first ever apartment with two suitcases, only around $200 USD to live off\
  \ of and no means for more income. I didn't speak the language so naturally, I applied\
  \ for jobs in customer service. Selling my willingness to learn and lying about\
  \ my level of experience, I landed a job as a waitress at a new cafe in the business\
  \ district of Tokyo. There, as the only foreigner, I failed again and again with\
  \ a huge smile on my face. I am a woman; there was a time when people believed amiability\
  \ to be all a woman needed to be okay in life. That sentiment is still alive and\
  \ well in Japan. I studied Japanese culture and as I learned the language I quickly\
  \ became able to transform every single day. A desperate need to survive in this\
  \ new world I dived head-first into was the bite. Grit, my power and willingness\
  \ to work was the catalyst to my transformation. I became not a man in wolf's clothing\
  \ but an American in Japanese clothing.\n\n I saw assimilation as the key to finding\
  \ my place in this place called, Tokyo. When in Rome, right?  So I gave it a try.\
  \ I got awfully good at convincing those around me that I was indeed born and raised\
  \ in Japan and that it was all I knew. This was the customer service version of\
  \ me. The real me, similarly changed by Japan, was a gif presented to my friends,\
  \ co-workers, and those who cared to know me. My ability to switch impressed those\
  \ around me and allowed for me to make real connections these people who saw me.\
  \ I did not at all expect my part-time assimilation to be the key. I didn't have\
  \ to fully change. I didn't have to wear the wolf's clothing all the time, only\
  \ when it was appropriate. \n\nAs I continue to travel in a world where every single\
  \ human being is different from the last but somehow identical to the next, I feel\
  \ my greatest asset is being an American werewolf."
