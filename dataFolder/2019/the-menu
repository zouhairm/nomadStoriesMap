Text: "I went to Greece with my sister to participate in an exhibition and people\
  \ there are not very fond of the English language so, we needed to hire a local\
  \ girl for communication. Similarly, other participants also hired young girls or\
  \ boys for translation.\n\nI am very fond of eating but, since the menu would be\
  \ Greek, I couldn't read it. I had to ask the staff whom we had hired to translate\
  \ it for me and order my food as well. Every day I would explore the menu and try\
  \ different food. This food hunt connected me with the local boys and girls who\
  \ worked there. They loved conversing with me and we discussed culture, politics,\
  \ movies; from actors to songs we discussed it all.\n\nWe would talk about studies,\
  \ courses and our interest in foreign languages. Other participants were shocked\
  \ to see me and my sister getting along with the locals with so much ease as if\
  \ it is my own country.\n\nWe had so much fun with the staff and got so comfortable\
  \ with them that we could even discuss boys, especially the Indian boy's. The girl\
  \ my sister had hired liked an Indian man and kept asking about him. We were so\
  \ warm and probably, that's what made her comfortable in discussing anything with\
  \ us. And not just her, but other girls and boys shared the same comfort and bond\
  \ with us.\n\nThis bond made me feel like home. I am very fond of eating and questioned\
  \ every day about what's new? what to order? I explored the menu every day which\
  \ made other people curious and they also wanted to do the same. Then one day I\
  \ and my sister ordered pasta and a burger, it was really tasty and I told my sister\
  \ that we must have it again. I gave the same feedback to other participants as\
  \ well, when they asked me about the food. \n\nTo my surprise the next day everyone\
  \ had ordered the same food. All of us ordered from the same place and the delivery\
  \ boy was carrying food worth 50 euro. It was like a party, everyone was eating\
  \ and enjoying themselves. And all of this happened because of exploring the menu!"
