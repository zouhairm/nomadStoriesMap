Text: "I actually wish for a taste more fear. Let me think through what I'm going\
  \ to do so much it stops me, let me be overly safe, let me fear the unknown. Just\
  \ a bit more. My mother has the whole \"fear\" thing down to a science and to be\
  \ honest, it saves her both money and effort. After multiple years of traveling\
  \ alone to more than six countries, I found the one thing that finally brought me\
  \ fear. That stopped me in my tracks. Rerouted my plans. When I was leaving for\
  \ my trip to Thailand my pretrip conversations were peppered with \u201CBe safe,\u201D\
  \ \u201CWatch your drink,\u201D \u201CDon\u2019t walk alone at night.\u201D To a\
  \ male coworker taking a similar trip, friends said, \u201Chave the best time.\u201D\
  \ He even got a few \u201Cget its.\u201D So a man going on a solo trip is encouraged\
  \ to go into the home of a man who is a complete stranger while I can\u2019t even\
  \ pee if I\u2019m not finished with my drink? But there I was in Thailand finally\
  \ feeling fear as a woman traveling alone and I can safely say it wasn't due to\
  \ a man. I spent my very first night in Bangkok at the Michelin Star restaurant\
  \ where Jay Fai cooks. I walked through what looked like a seedy part of town with\
  \ that giddy kind of joy you get when your latte art will make for the perfect Insta\
  \ pic. As I put my name on the waiting list, I saw a man flick something off his\
  \ shoulder. I followed the flicked \"thing\" to the ground where I came to terms\
  \ with the fact that I was standing in a pit of cockroaches. I counted ten before\
  \ I gave up my dreams of a Michelin Star crab omelette and settled for an indoor\
  \ green curry a few blocks away. After all the solo trips I had taken up to that\
  \ point, having dealt with drunk Irish men in Paris who seemed to lose the word\
  \ \"no\" in the translation from English to English, to the cab driver who tried\
  \ to run me out of the cab in China, to being stalked multiple blocks by a man in\
  \ the south of France, to my own daily happenings I encounter on the NYC subway,\
  \ you would think that cockroaches wouldn't have been the climax of my fear yet\
  \ there we were. I tip toe ran (you know that run you do that makes you feel like\
  \ you're on the ground too little of a time to actually have a bug climb on to you)\
  \ the entire walk home. A week later, I was in a small northern town called Pai\
  \ where once again my fear just wouldn't kick in until it was too late. I confidently\
  \ rented a motor bike believing that my Citibike membership back home made for fantastic\
  \ training. Five seconds on the scooter and this new thing for me called fear started\
  \ to bubble up. A sensible five more seconds on the scooter and bam. My face planted,\
  \ the bike fell on top of me, and my knees found a place among the rocks. I got\
  \ up only to listen to a man yell at me for crashing his bike. I then proceeded\
  \ to cry and head to 7/11 to bandage up. As I sat on a bench outside 7/11, a man\
  \ I had met in Bangkok just a few days earlier walked by. It was like being home\
  \ with your mom when you're sick. You can take care of yourself but sometimes you\
  \ just want someone to ask if you want chicken soup. He didn't ask if I wanted chicken\
  \ soup but he might as well have because all I heard was chicken soup, chicken soup,\
  \ ginger ale. I'm excited for what travels are ahead of me in the next few years\
  \ and what lessons I'll learn due to my lack of fear but if there's one thing I've\
  \ already learned it's that bruises heal, unplanned memories make great first date\
  \ stories, and women can travel alone."
