Text: "\u201CA bear has come to the village. I can take you?\u201D Andre suggested\
  \ with a head shake. We had first crossed paths when I investigated his sweet stall\
  \ for chikki, a brittle characterised by the use of jaggery - a mix of molasses\
  \ and spicy golden caramel - to bind the roasted peanuts together. Though originating\
  \ in the small western town of Lonavla, chikki is a familiar sight on street-food\
  \ stands throughout India - an unanticipated side effect to the development of the\
  \ passenger railway in the early 20th century. By happy coincidence for those with\
  \ a sweet tooth, the snack sold beside Lonavla\u2019s station proved a hit with\
  \ early passengers, and as the rail network spread so too did the recipe! I had\
  \ been hooked from my first bite of the delightfully sweet and chewy squares, and\
  \ though there were many stalls lining the winding cobbled street, it was Andre\u2019\
  s that I headed to daily. A doting father with mischievous eyes and a permanent\
  \ smile, his pleasure in my chikki appreciation was matched only by his joy at speaking\
  \ English, which he spoke slightly brokenly with a soft Indian lilt - English heritage\
  \ at an unspecified point in his lineage had bestowed upon him the keen desire to\
  \ learn English and a Western name that seemed at odds with the surroundings. Nestled\
  \ in the arid mountains of south western Rajasthan, Mount Abu\u2019s small population\
  \ of 22,000 is positioned around lake Nakki. It is surrounded by lush, dense forest\
  \ to which it owes its reputation as an oasis in the desert; although it is renowned\
  \ locally as a top honeymoon destination for newlywed couples, as the fleet of swan-shaped\
  \ pedalos on the lake can attest. Consciously casting from my mind the tale of a\
  \ tourist that had recently had their eyes gouged out by a bear gleefully recounted\
  \ by my hostel owner, I hopped onto the back of Andre\u2019s motorcycle.\n     \
  \    Though the forests are home to a thriving population of sloth bears, it is\
  \ unusual for them to venture into populated areas and a crowd had gathered. Full\
  \ of anticipation we joined the throng. My excitement proved short lived as Andre\
  \ made sense of the hubbub for me: the bear was in fact three - a mother bear with\
  \ two cubs. Nothing is more dangerous than a bear protecting cubs, and the bear\
  \ family lured to the fringes of the town in search of food now found themselves\
  \ cornered on a ledge in the rocks immediately above a Primary School. Straining\
  \ my ears, I could faintly hear the muffled cries of the terrified school children\
  \ trapped within.\n        Various strategies for flushing the bears out back to\
  \ the forest were urgently being discussed. It dawned on me that there was a fifty-fifty\
  \ chance the utterly unpredictable wild bears would be rampaging straight at us!\
  \ Fear rippled across the crowd as we scattered, rushing to distance ourselves.\
  \ Sheltering in an opening a short distance away, I gripped the door frame tightly\
  \ with sticky palms not, for the first time in a long while, due to the humidity.\
  \ My heart was racing. I waited with baited breath as the cries of the men armed\
  \ with sticks rang out. The trees shook wildly as if by an invisible hand, and the\
  \ frenzied shouts sent adrenaline coursing through my veins. As the air already\
  \ heavy with humidity became saturated by noise, I had the eerie sensation that\
  \ I was floating high above my body watching the situation unfold.\n    Just as\
  \ quickly as it had come, the clamour receded. By a stroke of luck, the bear family\
  \ had fled back to the forest in the opposite direction. Andre and I grinned at\
  \ each other, giddy with the sense of having flirted with danger and escaped unscathed.\
  \ Word had spread across the town and we received a heroes welcome from Andre\u2019\
  s family; though it was, of course, over more chikki that we steadied our nerves.\
  \ Now when I think back to my travels through India, the first thing that springs\
  \ to mind isn't the air laden with humidity and spice or the gloriously majestic\
  \ Taj Mahal, but the fresh mountain breeze with a hint of danger and the taste of\
  \ burnt caramel."
