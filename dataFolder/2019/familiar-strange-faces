Text: "Faces stare back at me, wide-eyed, scared, sullen, angry, resigned. Row after\
  \ row, thousands of them. My heart twists, my vision blurring; the round brown faces\
  \ and dark eyes of the younger boys remind me of my brother, half a world away.\
  \ Slowly, the implications of these photos sink in. \n\nI\u2019m visiting what once\
  \ was Tuol Svay Prey High School, then became S-21 interrogation camp but is now\
  \ known as Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, in Cambodia. The overseers of this prison\
  \ were meticulous. They documented and photographed those who entered their walls\
  \ \u2013 it is these faces that stare back at me. Room after room is filled with\
  \ their mugshots, names unknown. An estimated 20,000 prisoners passed through S-21.\
  \ Almost all were tortured and killed.\n\nUnlike the Killing Fields, the more well-known\
  \ site documenting the Khmer Rouge genocide, Tuol Sleng is situated in the middle\
  \ of Phnom Penh, Cambodia\u2019s capital. It\u2019s an unassuming location. If you\
  \ glanced at a photo, you would be forgiven for thinking it was simply a dilapidated\
  \ high school, rather than the site of horrific crimes against humanity. Multi-storied\
  \ concrete blocks of classrooms sit squat, overlooking a grass space framed with\
  \ trees and greenery. There are even some benches to rest on. The barbed wire covering\
  \ the buildings is a giveaway. It was put in place, our guide tells us, to prevent\
  \ prisoners from jumping. Many tried to seek death as an escape from their living\
  \ hell.\n\nMoving through the buildings, you can feel the weight of what happened\
  \ here. It is deeply upsetting, uncomfortable and confronting. A large board outside\
  \ lists the arbitrary rules of the camp in poorly translated English. The rooms\
  \ you walk through are the very same as those where tens of thousands were tortured.\
  \ The old tiles and bricks, what looks like a possible blood stain in the corner\
  \ of one room. Bed frames and chains are still in place, with photographs on the\
  \ walls of the corpses that were discovered by the liberating Vietnamese Army. \n\
  \nCambodia\u2019s history seems carved into its people. For much of the population,\
  \ the Khmer Rouge regime is still within living memory. A few days earlier our tour\
  \ guide had explained his deeply scared legs, damaged eye and missing finger. He\
  \ had been a professor of anthropology \u2013 a part of the intellectual class targeted\
  \ by the regime. His imprisonment and torture included being covered in fire ants,\
  \ and one time, being buried up to his neck. He escaped with the help of a guard\
  \ and ended up as a refugee for several years. \n\nHe is one of the survivors \u2013\
  \ an estimated 1.5 to 3 million people died during the Khmer Rouge\u2019s grip on\
  \ power from 1975-1979. Justice has been slow. Visiting the Extraordinary Chambers\
  \ in the Courts of Cambodia only highlights the fact that the cases against the\
  \ Khmer Rouge leaders are still in progress, nearly 40 years later. And yet my guide\
  \ was not bitter, just the opposite. His outlook was that he had already been through\
  \ the hardest times in his life, so he no longer had anything to worry about.\n\n\
  Touring Tuol Sleng is morbid, yet also compelling. For some of my tour group, it\
  \ is too much to bear, they sit on the benches, look up at the sky.\nI return to\
  \ the tiled room with its wall of photographs and look again at the young faces\
  \ that remind me so much of my brother."
