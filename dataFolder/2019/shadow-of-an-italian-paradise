Text: "La Maddalena was an island that remained dear and close to my heart for decades.\
  \ It was an island where even as I aged, I had hoped that it would remain as it\
  \ was in my memory; I had imagined it to remain untouched, a picturesque landscape\
  \ with its clear, emerald blue waters and its buildings painted in a rhythmic, earthy\
  \ palette. The existence of both urban and natural felt symbiotic and peaceful,\
  \ and it was my idea of paradise. I felt that returning would purify my senses and\
  \ cast aside the weight of the tribulations faced in young adulthood. It was on\
  \ this island that my life felt free, unburdened, and where I innocently and with\
  \ bright eyes eagerly perceived the world as a child. \n\nI initially had anxiety\
  \ regarding navigating around on my own, but my drive to see the island again gave\
  \ me the courage to break out of my shell and self-doubt. If it meant re-living\
  \ my memories and stepping foot on my beloved island, I was willing to go. \n\n\
  As I boarded the ferry from Palau, I saw La Maddalena from the distance. Memories\
  \ of my childhood started to flood into my mind, and my heart raced from excitement.\
  \ The laughter of children around me as I ran around chasing my friends in Piazza\
  \ Comando on a late, warm summer evening, dipping my feet into the crystal clear\
  \ waters as tiny fish scurried away from me, and sharing a pizza and rotisserie\
  \ chicken with my family from our favorite pizzeria\u2014all these precious memories\
  \ arose from my subconscious, and I couldn\u2019t resist the smile that broke out\
  \ from a usually composed face.\n\nWhen I arrived in La Maddalena, it was 2 PM on\
  \ a Friday. I quickly made my way to my AirBnb accommodation and walked to Piazza\
  \ Comando. As I walked along the narrow, brick walkways, I originally had worn a\
  \ sparkling smile but within minutes, it had transformed into worry. I looked to\
  \ my side and saw how numerous buildings donned chipped and dull paint, as if forgotten\
  \ for years. I looked ahead and saw no cars driving on the road nor people walking.\
  \ I looked to my right and found the entrance to the military base my father worked\
  \ on, only to find that the building had been demolished in favor of a grocery market.\
  \ Once I arrived at the piazza, there was no one to be found. I went to my old apartment\
  \ complex and was surprised to find that it was converted into a hotel. Lastly,\
  \ I went to my elementary school, Vista Mare, and became heartbroken to find that\
  \ it was now dilapidated.\n\nWhere is everyone? Why doesn\u2019t this feel like\
  \ how I remembered? This whole island feels lonely.\n\n\u201CHave you ever seen\
  \ the movie, \u2018Sleepy Hollow?\u2019 Ever since the Americans left, it\u2019\
  s been a ghost town.\u201D These were the words a local had told me within the first\
  \ few hours upon arrival. I thought it was a silly comment but over the course of\
  \ three days, it rang true.\n\nThis once lively island felt muted, and it didn\u2019\
  t take me long to realize that the entire island was indeed like a ghost town. \n\
  \nOn the last day, I went to a beach at Cala Francese. The path to the beach was\
  \ unassuming, as I had to follow a thin, dirt trail among hordes of bushes and shrubbery\
  \ to reach the water. I dipped myself in, fully clothed, and felt the warmth of\
  \ the water as I became lost in my thoughts. I basked in the silence and embraced\
  \ the solitude while at this beach. \n\nEven among all the changes, La Maddalena\
  \ still maintained its natural beauty. Its beaches were serene and well-protected,\
  \ and I loved how that was unchanged, even though remnants of my past had hurt my\
  \ expectations of how the town currently was. \n\nAs I left by ferry, I looked back\
  \ at the town, internally thanking it for all the wonderful memories this island\
  \ had given me as a young child to a young adult. I looked away and then forward\
  \ to mainland Sardinia."
