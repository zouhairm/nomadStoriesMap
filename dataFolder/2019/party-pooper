Text: "It\u2019s still early in the morning when I wake up shivering beneath my insufficiently\
  \ thick comforter. I can tell the heating system is switched off because I can\u2019\
  t hear the usual ticks and hums of the radiator. I yawn loudly in exasperation.\
  \ Across the room, my roommate is snoring softly. Instead of pajamas, Megan is rocking\
  \ tight jeans, a leather jacket and a maroon, peplum top. She\u2019s still wearing\
  \ makeup from the night before. At least she took off her boots, I think to myself.\n\
  When we first moved into our Florentine apartment, I remember Megan asking, \u201C\
  Why do we have a second little toilet next to the normal one?\" in her slow Philly\
  \ drawl.\n\u201COh, that\u2019s a bidet,\u201D I explained. \u201CItalians use it\
  \ to wash themselves after using the toilet.\u201D\n\u201CA What? A doo-bay?\u201D\
  \ she asked, laughing hysterically at this foreign concept of hygiene.\nSmiling\
  \ from the memory, I venture into the kitchen to prepare coffee in the moka pot.\
  \ I walk past our living room where I see Megan\u2019s friend, Carly, is sleeping\
  \ on our couch. She\u2019s visiting for the week. In the kitchen, I notice sticky\
  \ shot glasses and wine bottles litter the table from their night out. In past conversations,\
  \ my Florentine neighbors have casually remarked, \u201CAmericans drink too much,\u201D\
  \ making a hand gesture for drinking (hold your pinkie and thumb out and motion\
  \ your thumb toward your mouth). Throwing the bottles in the garbage, I can understand\
  \ their frustration.\nAs I sip my coffee, I watch the sun rise and slowly turn the\
  \ cityscape into a sea of gold. I take my time to indulge in this view on via Torta.\
  \ I adore my apartment because of its proximity to the Basilica di Santa Croce.\
  \ Across the street, I see Stefano is opening his pizzicheria where I often buy\
  \ paninis. There\u2019s a long lineup of vespas parked near my favorite gelateria,\
  \ Vivoli. In the distance, I can even spot the tip of Brunelleschi\u2019s cupola.\
  \ Florence is a city that is comfortable in its legacy. Even the mundane; the terracotta\
  \ roofs, wooden window shutters and aged stone walls draw on a deep-rooted tradition.\
  \ I sigh happily and turn to use the restroom.\nI lock the bathroom door behind\
  \ me, and I\u2019m suddenly bombarded by a pungent smell. Tears form at the corners\
  \ of my eyes. I gag and quickly bury my nose in the crook of my elbow. The smell\
  \ is tangible in its rancidness like a thick penumbra has taken over the room. I\
  \ discover that the source of the smell is a lump of poop in the bathroom\u2019\
  s bidet. Evidently, the perpetrator is our guest, Carly. I bolt out of the bathroom,\
  \ still holding my nose, and walk straight into her!\n\u201CSorry, I didn\u2019\
  t see you there,\u201D I mutter awkwardly.\n\u201CNo problem! Excuse me,\u201D Carly\
  \ says, walking past me to the bathroom. Perhaps irrationally, I worry that she\
  \ might see the poop and place the blame on me since I was using the bathroom before\
  \ her.\n\u201CNo! Wait!\u201D I call frantically, but she has already closed the\
  \ door. I run to get my roommate. \u201CWake up!\u201D I whisper-shout, desperate\
  \ for help. \u201CSomeone pooped in the bidet!\u201D\nBefore Megan can comprehend\
  \ what I\u2019m saying, I burst into fits of laughter. I can\u2019t talk from laughing\
  \ so hard. When I finally get the words out, we both struggle to stifle our laughter\
  \ from the bedroom.\nThe lesson to be learned from this story is twofold. First,\
  \ tourists have a responsibility when they\u2019re in a foreign destination. Travel\
  \ is an opportunity to eat delicious local foods, see famous sights and engage with\
  \ a new culture. It\u2019s also a chance to drink and celebrate with friends. These\
  \ are all good things! There is nothing wrong with enjoying the travel lifestyle\
  \ to the fullest. Sometimes in our excitement though we can forget to be respectful\
  \ of the local lifestyle. Admittedly, it is funny that a tourist went to Italy and\
  \ mistakenly pooped in a bidet; However, it also shows that we can do better as\
  \ visitors.\nSecond, always make sure you don\u2019t mistakenly use a bidet when\
  \ you need the toilet."
