Text: "The earth was rushing up too fast. Rotor blades drowning out my screams. Then\
  \ I heard laughter come through my headset. We were about to become a statistic\
  \ on this lonesome landscape and someone was chortling?! \n\nI should have expected\
  \ it, I have lived here long enough. Australia. I don\u2019t believe it is in the\
  \ Australian psyche to take themselves or anything else particularly seriously and\
  \ I had arrived in The Outback, its beating red heart. After living with my Australian\
  \ partner on the verdant and populous East Coast for a few years, I was drawn to\
  \ the enflamed palette of the Red Centre. The trip had started with Uluru and the\
  \ Olgas, both magnificently spiritual and awe-inspiring as their great hulking masses\
  \ rise up against the vast expanse of an otherwise featureless desert. However,\
  \ after jostling with the army of tourists who had managed to get between me and\
  \ these monoliths (not an easy task, they\u2019re pretty big) I was weary and in\
  \ search of a different perspective. \n\nLuckily, the next stop was Kings Canyon\
  \ over 300kms away. Upon arrival I shouldn\u2019t have wondered why there were no\
  \ crowds when the first thing we were faced with is something called \u2018Heart\
  \ Attack Hill\u2019. The lack of subtlety had not been lost.  Even so, after staggering\
  \ up its 100m high walls in 37 Celsius heat we were rewarded when, peering over\
  \ the canyon\u2019s edge, we spied its oasis within. Walking trails weaved around\
  \ gum trees as birds shrieked and disappeared into the cool confines of the aptly\
  \ named Garden of Eden far below. It was there, as I rolled over and laid on my\
  \ back, catching my breath and staring into the dust-tinged blue sky, I realised\
  \ what my vantage point needed to be. To escape the crowds and really experience\
  \ the scale of this terrain, we had to see it from above.   \n\nBack at the Kings\
  \ Canyon home-stay the opportunity presented itself in the form of 30-minute helicopter\
  \ rides over the area. Having never flown in one before I was confronted with a\
  \ combination of excitement and nerves. During the pre-flight briefing the receptionist\
  \ assured us the conditions were perfect. Good. The pilot was over twenty-old. Wait,\
  \ what? And he had been flying at least a month. Erm, hang on a minute...!  \n\n\
  There wasn\u2019t a minute though and next thing the dust was swirling around us\
  \ on take-off as we slowly ascended above the home-stay and turned towards the Canyon.\
  \ With the desert growing before us what I had thought was made up of 'nothing'\
  \ until then was far from it. The view was incredible; from the chasmic scar etched\
  \ across the land to the distant mighty stones beyond. I was mesmerised when the\
  \ pilot chirpily chimed in:\n\nPilot: \"So where have you guys travelled from then?\"\
  \nUs: \"Canberra.\"\nPilot: \u201CNo way, I\u2019m from Canberra! You're not a politician\
  \ or work for the government though?\"\nUs: \"No!\"\nPilot: \"Good. You won't mind\
  \ if I do this then\u2026\"\n\nWith that he pushes the controls forward and plummets\
  \ the helicopter within meters of the tree line. We hurtle across the countryside\
  \ swinging around rocks and over cliffs. As I screamed, the pilot just laughed,\
  \ flying past the camels and brumbies galloping beneath us. Eventually we neared\
  \ the home-stay and he slowed the helicopter to a leisurely pace and I finally got\
  \ my breath back. \n\nPilot: \u201CHow was that?!\u201D \nMe (laughing): \u201C\
  Petrifying! Just don\u2019t do that with a Prime Minister back in Canberra ok?\u201D\
  \nPilot: \u201CHa yeah nah, I have a few thousand hours to get up before they\u2019\
  ll let me fly in that airspace\u201D\nMe: \u201CErm\u2026.\u201D\n\nWalking away\
  \ under the thundering blades and passing the next load of passengers, I caught\
  \ myself once again contemplating how close death we had come. Later, staring up\
  \ at the enormous Milk Way sky, I asked my partner if he thought the pilot did that\
  \ for every group. \u201CNah, I don\u2019t reckon\u201D, he replied, \u201Che\u2019\
  s a fellow Canberran. We might be a bit crazy, but we\u2019ll always be up for a\
  \ bit fun\u201D. I had to agree."
