Text: "This past summer, my wife and I spent about 5 weeks in Japan. It was part of\
  \ a much longer overall\_trip\_in the region that also included six other countries.\
  \ While each of them was unique in its own right, Japan stands out as the most prominent\
  \ contrast among them.\n\nAfter some reflection, I came to the conclusion that the\
  \ reason for this is because their economy doesn\u2019t rely heavily on tourism.\
  \ As a result, English is not widely spoken. In fact, almost no one we encountered\
  \ spoke English beyond some very basic words. Not only did very few people speak\
  \ it, but many public places had signs, menus, etc that were written only in Japanese.\
  \ \n\nOver the course of our 5 weeks there, I may not have learned how to speak\
  \ fluent Japanese, but despite the language barrier, I\_did learn\_some wonderful\
  \ things about their culture. One of those things is how much Japanese people go\
  \ out of their way to help strangers. I have so many memories of this that it\u2019\
  s tough to narrow it down to only one, but for the sake of brevity, I have chose\
  \ to share the following story with you.\n\nIt\u2019s about a waitress.\n\nOne day,\
  \ on our way back from attempting to hike to the summit of Mt. Fuji, my wife and\
  \ I decided to stop at Arakurayama Sengen Park. It was sort of a consolation prize\
  \ because due to treacherous weather conditions, they closed down the trail and\
  \ we were unable to complete the hike.\n\nAfter almost getting stuck on the mountain\
  \ in the middle of a hurricane, we managed to catch the only remaining bus back\
  \ to ground level. As we made our way back to Tokyo, we realized that we\u2019d\
  \ be passing by the famous Chureito Pagoda. In hopes of salvaging our day, we stopped\
  \ at Shimoyoshida Station and made the 15 minute trek to check it out. The pagoda\
  \ itself was picturesque and the panoramic views were breathtaking. It wasn\u2019\
  t the summit of Mt. Fuji, but it was still a very cool place to see.\n\nBy the time\
  \ we made it back to the train station, we had developed quite an appetite. We still\
  \ had about 45 minutes before our train was set to arrive so we found a nearby restaurant.\
  \ After perusing the menu, the waitress came over and was ready to take our order.\
  \ We had run out of cash so I inquired if they accepted credit cards, but to our\
  \ dismay, they did not. We thanked them and made our way back to the station. At\
  \ that point we were too tired to continue searching and we decided to just wait\
  \ until we got back to Tokyo. So we sat down.\n\nAbout 10 minutes passed when all\
  \ of a sudden the waitress from the restaurant came into the station. She wasn\u2019\
  t there to take the train. She came looking for us.\n\nWhy?\n\nBelieve it or not,\
  \ she was concerned that we\u2019d be hungry. This woman took a break from her work\
  \ shift so that she could find us to tell us about another nearby restaurant that\
  \ accepted credit cards. We were both in grateful disbelief. It\u2019s not like\
  \ we even told her that we were going back to the train station. We could have been\
  \ walking around somewhere in town, but she made it a point to track us down. You\
  \ know, just in case we were hungry.\n\nI cannot think of anywhere else that I\u2019\
  ve been where someone would go out of their way in this manner. In case you\u2019\
  re thinking that this is a one-off example, let me clarify it for you by saying\
  \ that it\u2019s not. Whether it was the businessman who derailed his busy day by\
  \ 30 minutes so he could personally walk us to our destination, or the retired engineer\
  \ who surprisingly spoke perfect English and acted as our translator for 2 hours\u200A\
  \u2014\u200Athe Japanese people are incredibly helpful to strangers. They really\
  \ go above and beyond for no other reason than it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\
  \nI think that is something we could all aspire to do a little bit more of."
