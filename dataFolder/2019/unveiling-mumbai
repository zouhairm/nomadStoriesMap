Text: "So my first trip overseas...first ever...was in mysterious Mumbai in India\
  \ at the start of this year. For a South African girl like me, this was a leap into\
  \ the unknown! I enjoyed every bit of the travelling - the flight from Johannesburg,\
  \ to the stop over in Dubai and then enter Mumbai! We were shuttled to the splendid\
  \ Taj Lands End hotel, in an area called Bandra West right by the beach. As we entered\
  \ the foyer, we were welcomed by such a warm and friendly reception from the hotel\
  \ staff, and really felt like honoured guests in that breathtaking space. \n\nSoon\
  \ after we refreshed and replenished in the gorgeous rooms, we made our way to town\
  \ to find some chow. Boy the transport system in that city is like nothing I have\
  \ ever experienced...our taxi drivers back in Joburg are mere granny drivers compared\
  \ to the Mumbai Tuk Tuk drivers! Those guys live life on the edge hahaha. But they\
  \ get you to exactly where you asked, at a very affordable rate and in one piece.\n\
  \nThe following day, we decided to take a train ride to the massive, busy outdoor\
  \ laundromat called Dhobigat. The stories we heard about catching a train at Mahalaxhmi\
  \ station don't come close to the actual experience...we were packed into the female\
  \ coach like sardines in a can! What a frightening yet thrilling ride we had, squeezed\
  \ so close to each other. \n\nFrom the laundromat we went to the slums of Dharavi,\
  \ and witnessed a typical day in the life of a humble Mumbai local. In the midst\
  \ of the squalor and poverty, we found joy and awe in the faces of the local children\
  \ as they admired the synthetic braids in our hair, our black skins and foreign\
  \ features.\n\nWe also visited the local market  and found that you could buy almost\
  \ anything there...from door knobs to a tea set. We had lunch at the glamorous Palladium\
  \ shopping mall, where the rich and famous frequent. T'was such a glaring difference\
  \ from our earlier stop in the slums and unveiled the hierachy system that was so\
  \ evident from one end of the city to the other.\n\nWe spent the night dining at\
  \ Mahesh restaraunt in Juhu, where we were spoiled for choice from amongst the Indian\
  \ cuisine at the buffet. After filling our tummies, we took a Tuk Tuk to the local\
  \ night club called Rasta. The DJ pleasantly surprised by playing familiar songs\
  \ from the African continent. We felt right at home on that dance floor!\n\nFrom\
  \ the Gateway of India, a port where ships land to deliver goods from foreign lands\
  \ to the Khala Gorda art precinct, this city gave us so much life and diversity.\
  \ A feast for the senses! The people of Mumbai are vibrant and full of energy. Life\
  \ moves at such a fast pace there, everyone is on a mission to be or to get somewhere.\
  \ The people are hard workers who labour from dusk to dawn to feed and provide for\
  \ their families. I thoroughly enjoyed being engrossed in the rich culture and food,\
  \ the bright colours and the loud city sounds of the cab drivers. Mumbai was truly\
  \ unveiled and revealed!"
