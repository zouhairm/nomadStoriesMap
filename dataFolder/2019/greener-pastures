Text: "It took a great deal of willpower to overcome the fear rooted in my nerves,\
  \ a seed planted in me when I was a child and poisoning every dream and desire that\
  \ I had; a wild, invasive parasite looking for a new body to grow in because its\
  \ former host, my grandmother, already held too much of that misery in her small,\
  \ bent frame that there simply wasn\u2019t enough room for it to thrive.\n\n\tI\
  \ crouched at the base of the grape tree to take a cluster of the dark, plump sweetness\
  \ that looked like jewels in my palm, and thank goodness none of the other adventurers\
  \ and visitors were within earshot of me, because I laughed. I laughed, a little\
  \ too loudly despite there being no humor, because holding the fruits of the Prince\u2019\
  s Vineyard reminded me of how there wasn\u2019t a lack of trying on my grandmother\u2019\
  s part.\n\n\tMy grandmother\u2019s poison of choice wasn\u2019t exactly royal quality\
  \ like the bottled and aged wine in the Prince of Liechtenstein\u2019s cellars,\
  \ but she still drained her meager checks for cases of the beer that was enough\
  \ for a small party, and sucked every last drop away until it hurt less. Until her\
  \ lids drooped and eyes glazed and she couldn\u2019t see how she was trapped in\
  \ the confines of the cigarette stale living room. Until she was relaxed enough\
  \ to feel no shame in ordering her young, five-year-old granddaughter to fetch her\
  \ another can. Until her inhibitions were eaten away for yet another night, and\
  \ for yet another night, she\u2019d filled her granddaughter\u2019s ears with hatred\
  \ that can only come from the pits of Hell, and lure her granddaughter away from\
  \ her mother, her siblings, her opportunity to make friends; planting the seed of\
  \ misery in this young, malleable tot because no one wants to be evil alone.\n\n\
  \tShe drank until the burden of all her fears of a terrible childhood and anger\
  \ for her own, absent mother was bearable, because forgiving the ones who wronged\
  \ her, or at the very least letting it the fuck go, is an impossibility, but chaining\
  \ whoever my grandmother could chain to her, so that none could experience beauty\
  \ beyond the cold can or the menthol tobacco, now that was the proper action to\
  \ take.\n\n\tI laughed some more, moving my hand up until I made the error of disturbing\
  \ a hidden nest of finches and two flew right over my ducking head. I laughed because\
  \ my feet were sore from the hike on the Prince\u2019s Way, my chest was congested\
  \ from the eight-hour flight from which I\u2019m sure I was developing a cold, and\
  \ my arms and wallet ached from the bags of souvenirs I had to carry all the way\
  \ back to my cramped hostel room, and damn, I still wouldn\u2019t trade all of this\
  \ physical pain \u2013 and with it the fresh air, the breathtaking, frosted slopes\
  \ of the Alps that was like walking through a painting, the shudder of soaring over\
  \ the seas and clouds, the trinkets of new lands I can hold in my cupped hands,\
  \ and the fireside chats with fellow hostel guests and writers who have crafted\
  \ new worlds in their works and inspired the craft in me \u2013 for the dreadful\
  \ \u201Ccomfort\u201D my keeper sought in those cheap ales.\n\n\tI laughed until\
  \ tears dripped from my chin and took home in the red soil, taking with it just\
  \ a little bit more of this heavy terror I\u2019m learning to let go."
