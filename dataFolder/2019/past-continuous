Text: "M: \u2018What do you mean what do I mean? Protecting Kosovo is a duty! I would\
  \ go to war with the Albanians tomorrow!\u2019 \n[silence]\nS: \u2018Shall we do\
  \ shots?\u2019\n\nI am usually very lucky with the weather. This time, however,\
  \ I was to experience Belgrade (Serbia) in the hazy light of a harsh winter.\n\n\
  Serbia\u2026not your usual touristic destination, you might think. Yet, there is\
  \ a particular excitement in the hearts of those who were born in post-communist\
  \ countries.  It is as if only you can fully understand why there are ruins of an\
  \ abandoned industrial building in the centre of the city, or why twenty-floor grey\
  \ blocs pierce the horizon. \n\nMy first view of Belgrade was just this: from the\
  \ terrace of a top floor, overlooking the dim, amber streetlights of a long boulevard\
  \ covered in snow, enjoying the silence of a late night. Yet, it was only when I\
  \ peered over the balustrade that I truly felt Belgrade for the first time \u2013\
  \ the grand building of Metropol hotel - the stately memento of a past regime. It\
  \ had raw concrete, stark geometry and the iconic white fa\xE7ade. It all looked\
  \ immaculate, sterile\u2026ordered\u2026\n\u2018Come here, you need to see this!\u2019\
  , I could hear from the inside.\n\nA last glance at the horizon, I thought to myself.\
  \ How reassuring it is to see the silhouette of a giant cathedral illuminating the\
  \ murky sky from afar.\nIt was about the protests. They were all over the media;\
  \ the protests against Vu\u010Di\u0107, the current president, who, from what I\
  \ was informed by my friend, leads a borderline authoritarian presidency. Or at\
  \ least, that is what a growing amount of people has the courage to acknowledge.\
  \  \n\nIn daylight, Belgrade looked splendid. As we wandered on the boulevards,\
  \ I could not help but be impressed by the architecture. Everything about the city\
  \ was very eclectic. I look up and see Corinthian columns, Parisian-style balconies,\
  \ and colourful Secession fa\xE7ades \u2013 not precisely what you would initially\
  \ expect. And yet, a few minutes later, I look up again and find myself overshadowed\
  \ by the rigid edges of a communist building. This is why I say that this unique\
  \ blend can only be found in such countries \u2013 countries that carry the scars\
  \ of their past within the walls of their buildings, \u2018destroyed and rebuilt\u2019\
  \ (as Serbians put it) in both physical and cultural terms. With every step forward,\
  \ it became clear to me that \u2018the ruins\u2019 of this city are \u2018the future\
  \ of the monument,\u2019 bearing the marks and reminisces of what it has been and\
  \ what it is to come. But what is to come? \n\nWith that question in mind and the\
  \ sweet smell of pastries filling my nostrils, we stopped at the kiosk to buy some\
  \ cigarettes. Amongst the chewing gum, lighters and other little things a stall\
  \ sells, I could see the title of a pile of newspapers. It was written in Cyrillic,\
  \ and it was bold and red. And, although I could not fully decipher the letters,\
  \ it inspired urgency; it looked like breaking news. \n\nMe: \u2018What exactly\
  \ does this say?\u2019\n\nI: \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t think you want to know\u2026\
  \u2019 \u2018It reads: \u201CAlbanians proclaimed war to Serbia. Total chaos is\
  \ about to come.\u201D\u2019\n\nThe most read newspaper, that is. \n\nAnd that \u2018\
  information\u2019 was\u2026factually not accurate.\n\nIt was getting dark, and I.\
  \ decided to head towards a shisha bar where I was supposed to meet some people\
  \ \u2013 both friends of hers and locals. The sense of expectancy was high, since\
  \ I was finally going to hear the voices of the young people of Belgrade, the new\
  \ generation. \n\nIn the smoky air of a shisha bar, therefore, I was going to meet\
  \ M., who I learnt had the opportunity to study abroad \u2013 he did his SATs in\
  \ America. M. was also interested in the wider world, politics, he was kind, shy,\
  \ yet curious in getting to know more about me. He was pious, wearing a bracelet\
  \ with tiny religious iconography. He believed in honour, as one should do. \n\n\
  \u2018As one should do\u2026\u2019 kept coming back to me days after that. \n\n\
  M. is nineteen and would go to war for Kosovo, with the Albanians. \n\n\nWhat is\
  \ honour?"
