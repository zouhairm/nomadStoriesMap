Text: "There is something about diving into the unknown that makes us all feel like\
  \ children who wonder, what lies on the other side. The thrill is so exhilarating\
  \ mingled with a fear of the unknown at the same, it\u2019s so uncontainable you\
  \ do not even know how to express your emotions. Besides seeing Cape Town on television\
  \ and on brochures I had never been to the Mother City before and this would mark\
  \ my first solo travel to a place far away from home. \n\nWith the little money\
  \ I had, I wanted to see the terrains of our country land, the landmarks and landscapes,\
  \ things and places that hardly make it to magazines, the simple yet precious sights.\
  \ So I booked my bus ride, which would take about 20 hours till my destination,\
  \ but I did not mind as long as I got to see and learn about what is out there beyond\
  \ my home.\n\nI enjoyed seeing the sunrise on the road in the middle of nowhere.\
  \ The terrains were mainly unoccupied dry land, rocky mountains and mostly vineyards\
  \ which was beautiful to behold, that so much of land as far as the eyes can see\
  \ is undisturbed by human impact or deforestation. \n\nI was not sure of the experience\
  \ I would have, so I booked into three different places. The first was a hostel,\
  \ then a Bed and Breakfast and last was a room in a couple\u2019s home. The hostel\
  \ was right in the city and as the nature of hostels and a tight budget, I had to\
  \ share a dorm with eight women, I didn\u2019t know if I could do that, but my budget\
  \ spoke a different story which led me to meet other wanderers like myself, real\
  \ backpackers.\n\n The women were from Brazil, England, Zimbabwe, Switzerland, and\
  \ many other countries and none of them were there on business. They were all there\
  \ to see the tip of Africa where two oceans meet and here, we were sleeping in the\
  \ same room and sharing a Honey badger breakfast. It was all a wonder for me, a\
  \ first and absolute mind-blowing travel experience. I tried to speak to all the\
  \ ladies, but when the traveling bug has got you, you can\u2019t stay in the same\
  \ place for eternity (that being a few hours), I could not track the ladies with\
  \ all the in\u2019s and out, the hellos and goodbyes. We all had places to see and\
  \ people to meet, I went walking around the city, I was so happy the trees and architecture\
  \ made me smile.\n\nI went on the red touring bus, around the city and got off at\
  \ almost every stop. The most exciting stop for me was one of the seven world wonders\
  \ of nature Table Mountain, I went on the cable which took us up the mountain and\
  \ my God I saw the Atlantic ocean for the first time on the way up.  It\u2019s true\
  \ what they said about Cape Town having four seasons in a day, the mountain was\
  \ a bit windy, cold and misty. I saw the whole of Cape Town it was beautiful indeed,\
  \ I took a thousand pictures to show.\n\nA big milestone for me was visiting Robben\
  \ Island, the iconic incubator of South Africa\u2019s 25year old democracy. We sailed\
  \ over to the island in a beautiful boat, I sat at the back and watched as we got\
  \ further off the harbour and observed the ripples in the lime greenish-blue water,\
  \ I could not believe my eyes. When we got the island, I loved our tour guide\u2019\
  s energy, how he clearly shared the history leading around the island and finally\
  \ to the Prison where Nelson Mandela and political activists were detained for more\
  \ than decades.\n\nI visited the Old Biscuit Mill, I loved all the shops there,\
  \ selling beautiful artwork, I felt like buying everything, the bags and handmade\
  \ accessories.\n \nComing back home, I was a mix of emotions I wanted to stay longer\
  \ but I was also thrilled for my first flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg where\
  \ my family would pick me up. The flight would be two hours compared to the 20 hours\
  \ coming to Cape Town."
