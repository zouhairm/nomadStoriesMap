Text: "Scotland and The Isle of Skye\n\nIn May 2017 I went to Scotland with 3 years\
  \ worth of disappointment, a lack of hope and a lot of uncertainty having just quit\
  \ my job. Working as a health insurance customer service representative and point\
  \ person for life, disability and critical illness insurance claims exposed me to\
  \ a lot of sadness, despair and at times the very worst in people. With this trip\
  \ I was in search of myself, a person I had lost in that job. I decided I needed\
  \ to get as far away from Toronto and the Isle of Skye, Scotland seemed like the\
  \ place to go. \n\nThe highlands are a place full of folklore, hospitality, pride\
  \ and mysticism. My tour was full of fairy tales alongside actual accounts of history.\
  \ Scotland knows its past and is proud to share it. I would suggest some research\
  \ (and of course an \"Outlander\" binge-fest) to truly appreciate the country. \n\
  \nOn my trip I saw Loch Ness (no monster), the Fairy Pools, Old Man of Storr, the\
  \ Mackenzie castle, Eilean Donan castle and a few geographic wonders. There were\
  \ a lot of stories involving Clansmen, Vikings, Romans, an ancient tribal race called\
  \ the Picts who would paint themselves blue and fight naked. There were stories\
  \ of giants, warriors, princesses, clever soldiers and cunning merchants.\n\nI learned\
  \ about whiskey, and the Scottish way of life before the British interfered. One\
  \ of my favourite facts about Scotland is that their official mascot is a unicorn.\
  \ A tour guide once said it was because \u201Ca Scot is like a unicorn, free and\
  \ mystical \u2013\u2013 you can never catch one.\u201D. Unfortunately, I also learned\
  \ that the British Monarch's Coat of Arms includes a chained unicorn representing\
  \ their domain over Scotland \u2013\u2013 a little less free and mystical.\n\nHistory\
  \ and geography are the greatest stories of them all. The greed for power and the\
  \ shifts of power is relevant even today. I would strongly urge anyone to pick up\
  \ a starter history book regarding anywhere in the world and just learn. \n\n\n\n\
  Scotland: My Happy Place\n\nAnyone who has yet to visit the highlands should do\
  \ so whenever possible, if possible. The landscape is magnificent, soulful, and\
  \ epic. For me it was life changing.\n\nThis part of my trip was where I was able\
  \ to do some self reflection. I needed to forgive myself for slipping into a complacent\
  \ existence. It was not my job's fault, it was not my employer's fault, it was my\
  \ fault. I had to forgive myself for wasting such precious time and youth on something\
  \ that was not right for me. It was a learning experience but it was not worth the\
  \ pieces of myself that I had lost in the process.\n\n\nLooking up, I saw perfect\
  \ white clouds that frayed at the edges and melted into the blue of a sky that one\
  \ could mistake for a painting. The rolling mountains were a bright brown colour\
  \ with hints of green peering through. The mountains were divided by large pools\
  \ of water which felt heavy and soulful. When I focused my gaze on the weight of\
  \ the sea it made me feel like I was staring into the eyes of a person with a million\
  \ stories to tell, which only added to the impact of the landscape. Whenever the\
  \ sun peeked through the clouds and hit the ground it seemed as though I could feel\
  \ the earth breathing. This was the first time that I was brought to tears by the\
  \ majesty of nature. I felt everything and as I stood on a mountain overlooking\
  \ the Sound of Raasay, I promised I would never stray from my true self again. I\
  \ took a deep breath and kept climbing."
