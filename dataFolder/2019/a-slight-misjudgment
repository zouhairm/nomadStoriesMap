Text: "My heart raced as the Azeri soldiers emerged from the bushes. A raised hand\
  \ signalled for me to halt. It was an unnecessary gesture. I was already frozen\
  \ to the spot.\n\nThe three approaching soldiers cradled AK-47s in their arms. Grenades\
  \ hung from their belts, next to long black knives. Behind them, the trail twisted\
  \ under the trees, up into the mountains that now seemed so very far away.\n\nThe\
  \ soldiers stopped. At this close distance, they looked terribly young. A wispy\
  \ beard clung to one\u2019s face; a uniform was draped loosely over another\u2019\
  s wiry frame. Only one exuded any authority \u2014 clearly an officer.\n\n\u201C\
  Speak Russian?\u201D the officer asked. His assault rifle dominated my vision as\
  \ I shook my head. \u201CThank you\u201D and \u201Cwhere\u2019s the bus station?\u201D\
  \ wouldn\u2019t cut it here.\n\nThe officer tapped his chest and uttered, \u201C\
  no English.\u201D An awkward silence followed. \u201CPassport,\u201D he asked, staring\
  \ at me coolly.\n\nI waited nervously as he inspected my documents, hoping that\
  \ questions wouldn\u2019t be asked about the Armenian visa. It wouldn\u2019t be\
  \ the first time I\u2019d met someone who\u2019d lost family in the Nagorno-Karabakh\
  \ conflict. But his stern expression gave nothing away.\n\nThe other soldiers watched\
  \ me with unsettling curiosity. My pulse quickened as I realised I was alone in\
  \ the mountains with these men; a camera on my shoulder, all my possessions in a\
  \ backpack. I smiled meekly, noticing the Azerbaijan flag on their uniforms, with\
  \ their surnames below. The officer\u2019s was Hasanov.\n\nHasanov pulled a battered\
  \ phone from his pocket and typed into a translation app. \u201CWe go,\u201D the\
  \ screen said, followed by \u201Cdanger\u201D. Hasanov gestured at the mountains\
  \ which were now shrouded in cloud, his eyes betraying some anxiety.\n\nWithout\
  \ a choice, I followed the soldiers along a side trail. I walked in front of Hasanov,\
  \ my dread growing, acutely aware that my passport hadn\u2019t been returned. What\
  \ was this danger? Did I break a law? Had I been arrested? The forest that had seemed\
  \ so welcoming was now full of menace, the shadows growing with each crunch of the\
  \ soldiers\u2019 boots.\n\nThe trail ascended a steep slope, ending at a sandbag\
  \ wall surrounded by a thick coil of barbed wire. Hasanov took us through a gap.\
  \ Behind was a small outpost. From this vantage point the valley dropped precipitously,\
  \ before rising again in wave of rock that ended with the summits of the Caucasus\
  \ Mountains \u2014 and Azerbaijan\u2019s border with Russia.\n\nA guard nodded at\
  \ Hasanov, before turning back to the valley, gripping his rifle firmly. Scrawled\
  \ on a post beside him were calculations; numbers for measuring bullet trajectory\
  \ when shooting into the valley. Empty shell casings littered the ground.\n\nI pretended\
  \ not to have seen this and followed Hasanov under a camouflage net and into a trench.\
  \ This led through a gate at the camp\u2019s rear, which Hasanov closed behind us.\
  \ The two other soldiers had disappeared.\n\nThere was no path, but Hasanov knew\
  \ the way, cutting expertly through the trees. I tried to quell the sinister thoughts\
  \ crowding my mind, ignoring the pistol on Hasanov\u2019s hip. \n\nJust as my confusion\
  \ was peaking, we came upon a shack in a clearing with a wooden table and chairs.\
  \ Hasanov motioned for me to sit, while he went inside. From within, a vigorous\
  \ conversation ensued. Was he discussing my fate?\n\nHasanov then re-emerged, a\
  \ bottle of kompot in one hand, a pot of tea in the other. A white-haired man followed\
  \ carrying a plate of lavash, a soft flatbread.\n\nSeeing the stunned look on my\
  \ face, Hasanov reached for his phone and typed into the translation app, \u201C\
  Azerbaijan hospitality.\u201D Relieved, I pitched over with laughter, my anxiety\
  \ washing away. The white-haired man returned with a plate of sizzling lamb chops\
  \ that were sprinkled with sumac.  \n\nEyeing the meat, I typed a message into my\
  \ phone. \u201CI\u2019m vegetarian,\u201D the screen said. I then paused. Thinking\
  \ better of it, I deleted the message and simply said, \u201Cthank you.\u201D\n\n\
  Hasanov beamed a massive smile as I reached for the food. Stuck in the mountains\
  \ with an armed soldier, embracing the local customs with a lamb chop in hand seemed\
  \ to be the best idea."
