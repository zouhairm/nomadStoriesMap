Text: "There is a profound silence this December morning. The straight deserted road\
  \ looks as if it has been drawn with the ruler. It stretches as far as my eyes can\
  \ see, in both directions. Nothing here announces Christmas, although we are just\
  \ 3 days away...\nDavide is not at his best today, he sits down on a stone, leaning\
  \ on his backpack, his eyes closed searching for the sun. Just 50 m away from us,\
  \ another young Moroccan guy is waiting. On the other side of the road, two women\
  \ appear out of the blue, with their sleepy babies tied in a blanket around their\
  \ back. No one greets, no one moves, no eyes intersect. Silence becomes so loud,\
  \ it even speaks over my thoughts. We are waiting for a ride. \n\nA black luxury\
  \ 4\xD74 stops. Tuareg driver, traditional clothes, talking to us through black\
  \ fancy sunglasses. He\u2019s inviting us to our common destination: Merzouga, \u201C\
  the Gates of the Sahara\u201D, one of the famous sand dune spots in Morocco.\n\n\
  Piercing the picture on the other side of the road\n\nThe car moves forward through\
  \ vast arid landscapes. We witness beautiful nothingness through the window of the\
  \ car until the sand dunes start to appear. \nSuddenly, the driver turns left without\
  \ notice, piercing through the frame of the \"picture\" we were gazing at, on the\
  \ other side of the road, adventuring as a runaway madman into the unknown. He avidly\
  \ drives the car full power towards the dunes, as a furious bull that sees nothing\
  \ else except what is in front of him, inside a Spanish Arena. To our luck, the\
  \ car accepts the challenge and succeeds every time on climbing and descending the\
  \ dunes. The adventure continues without words, long enough for us to come back\
  \ from reverie and start seriously worrying about it. We try to keep a calm vibe\
  \ into our voices; the questions begin pouring out: \"Where is the village?\", \"\
  We go to Merzouga. MER-ZOU-GA!\u201D,\u201D If you do not go there, you can leave\
  \ us here...we\u2019ll manage...\u201D. Looking always ahead, the driver finally\
  \ assures us that we are getting there, but first, he needs to check on his grazing\
  \ dromedaries. \n\_Following carefully some unknown directions, we stumbled upon\
  \ his astonishing animals resting peacefully in the shade of a bush. We finally\
  \ return on the main street and soon we reach our destination. We whispered half-heartedly\
  \ some \"thank you\u2019s\", and we head off to meet our host.\n\nSahara speaks\
  \ to me\n\nIt's midday. We find ourselves in the protective womb of a huge golden\
  \ dune, hidden away from the ragging sounds of quads drove by tourists we\u2019\
  ve met on our way. Davide is resting on the sand like a lizard under the burning\
  \ sun. \nI'm taking out my notebook from my backpack and I'm starting to write...I\u2019\
  m starting to listen.\n\"The vast fields of wheat and freshwater rivers, the lush\
  \ forests that once sheltered an unimaginable variety of plants, insects, animals,\
  \ fish and perhaps even our ancestors, are now resting here. Everyone has turned\
  \ back into a potential seed, the golden grain of light, the indestructible unit\
  \ of a living organism: the Desert. Who knows what this desert will turn into, in\
  \ the thousands of years to come? I may have become myself a glitter of sand, on\
  \ the palm of tomorrow's Sahara: a young girl with golden curls, who will wonder\
  \ about my origins.\n\nWhen the cosmos falls down on Earth\n\nAfter a nice dinner\
  \ shared with our host, we dress in all our clothes, as a shield against the whistling\
  \ wind, and we head outside with our headlights on. The village seems frozen in\
  \ the darkness... It\u2019s not long until the sky opens and the vivid Milky Way\
  \ descends on Earth, uniting the horizon line in front of us with the one behind\
  \ us in a perfect semicircle. I\u2019m spinning, my breathing is shallow: \u201C\
  I have not yet fully realized that we\u2019re truly living in the Cosmos!\u201D\n\
  Davide quickly pulls out his tripod and starts setting his camera. He is excited!\
  \ I take a few steps away from him, I sit down and...disappear into the darkness."
