Text: "Mumbai is well known as a fashion hub in South East Asia. The city host fashion\
  \ weeks and Mumbaikars are obsessed with the fashion trend and the city is a shopper's\
  \ dream. Through a tour in a number of street markets which is offering the latest\
  \ trends, you can find that in each corner offers something new, and the range varies\
  \ from high-end couture to daily cheap trendy clothes.\nLet me take you to a tour\
  \ to find your fashion and accessories, all at a much lower price, so make sure\
  \ to polish your bargain skills before heading out.\n\nOur first stop at Linking\
  \ Road, which is one of the most popular street markets in Mumbai. The stalls here\
  \ offer everything from shoes to Indian clothes to bags, clutches and even jewelry.\
  \ So, a small suggestion to you is spending a whole day browsing and bargaining.\
  \ There are also a number of fast Indian food eateries you can stop by to refuel\
  \ before you continue to endless stalls in this street. \nIf you use your bargaining\
  \ skills, you will save lots and lots of money in this large street before heading\
  \ to other markets in town.\nFashionistas and food lovers will like to walk in Colaba\
  \ Market. There\u2019s a lot you can buy here from fashion and footwear to handicrafts\
  \ and home accessories. Of course, you can't keep waking and shopping unless to\
  \ have several stops at the same street food, then you will have a different experience\
  \ of from Mumbai street food at any of the vendors serving cutting chai, bun maska,\
  \ and pani puri. If you decided to sit in a decent cafe then we recommend  Leopold\
  \ Cafe.\nBesides, Mumbai is the hub of fashion designers which is the trigger for\
  \ the city's love for fashion. Indian fashion designers are now at par with their\
  \ western counterparts and their popularity is only booming by the day.\n\nNo wonder\
  \ then, if Mumbai has the merits to be called the fashion capital of India. You\
  \ will be left spoilt for choices by the vendors with fashion clothes and accessories\
  \ for all ages where there are at least 100 shops to be seen in a row in each street."
