Text: "I had been traveling for over a month in Europe; I was exhausted and with zero\
  \ clean clothes. Location: Naples. I wanted to walk around the city so I took the\
  \ only t-shirt that didn't smell bad. It was a white and black vertical stripes\
  \ shirt with the Juventus logo. It was actually a gift I bought for my football\
  \ fanatic cousin. I didn\u2019t think it over and got out the hostel wearing that\
  \ shirt, a black baggy skirt and tennis shoes; definitely fashion has never been\
  \ my friend. \n \nIt was a hot august day. I was walking down the street, trying\
  \ not to fall from the narrow sidewalk. I started to see something was off when\
  \ I walked next to an Italian woman, she smiled at me saying \u201CBrava\u201D with\
  \ both of her thumbs up. \u201CWell, that was weird\u201D I thought. I let it go.\
  \ I was in Italy, nothing could bother me. I was wrong. \n\nI put one foot in the\
  \ downtown and I inmediately felt every single people staring at me. The men started\
  \ to yell for afar \u201CNAPOLI! NAPOLI!\u201D I kept walking; suddenly a group\
  \ of men surrounded me and kept yelling that to me and some other things in Italian\
  \ I didn't understand. One of them got so close to my face that I could see his\
  \ eyes injected with anger while he did that characteristic Italian gesture with\
  \ his right hand and shouted repeatedly \u201CNAPOLI!\u201D without taking his angry\
  \ eyes away from my confuse stare. His girlfriend saved me when got him away from\
  \ me. I was scared. Somehow, I got away from there and got into an alley. I relived\
  \ the moment in my mind and understood my unforgivable mistake: I was wearing the\
  \ wrong city football team shirt. \u201CF***\u201D I thought. \n \nThe only thing\
  \ that I could think about was that they wouldn't make a fuss if they knew I was\
  \ not Italian, so I took my map out, hold it tighly and I hoped for the best. I\
  \ kept walking in lonely alleys because I was so afraid of going out the main streets.\
  \ Suddenly, I saw two young men talking outside the door with an old woman. They\
  \ had a glance of me and immediately as they realized that I was wearing the Juve\
  \ shirt their looks went crazy. They were about to say something but I took my map\
  \ and held it high asking for some directions in English. Their expression softened,\
  \ they helped me out. Ok, my plan worked. I could do this; they just needed to know\
  \ I was a stupid tourist. \n \nI went to a wider street and there they were, a gang\
  \ of five men between 40 and 60. They looked at me and stopped talking. In one second\
  \ their expressions changed to moody. So, again, I pulled the map and moved it asking\
  \ for directions in English. The reaction was as if they were saying, \u201COh,\
  \ she just doesn't know\u201D so they helped me out, then they asked me about my\
  \ nationality. One of them, Mario, asked me about the Juventus shirt. \u201CI just\
  \ didn't have clean clothes,\u201D I said, and they all started laughing. \u201C\
  Bambina, the city you go is the shirt you wear\u201D he said. I laughed with them.\
  \ I said my goodbyes, and went away. Just around the corner I saw a little shop\
  \ that felt more like a closet where everything they sold there was of the Naples\
  \ football team and I saw my salvation: the Naples shirt. I went back to see my\
  \ friends to show them my new acquisition. They all cheered \u201CPut it on\u201D\
  \ so I did. \u201CNow you are Neapolitan, now coffee time\u201D they said and they\
  \ took me to a little coffee shop nearby, with a brown old wooden bar and tiny tables\
  \ and chairs, it was all packed up but it still felt cozy. Every single person inside\
  \ there knew my friends, we stayed at the bar and they invited me the first Italian\
  \ espresso I had ever had. We stayed there for a while, talking by mixing Italian,\
  \ Spanish and English, we talked about a bunch of stuff including, of course, football."
