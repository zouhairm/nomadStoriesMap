Text: "As I arrived home from my part time job, my long term boyfriend informed me\
  \ he had arrived on schedule to the cancun airport in Mexico.  I was heartbroken,\
  \ because it was my decision after we had a rough patch that I wouldn't be going\
  \ on our wonderful pre-paid trip and would be missing out on the culture shock that\
  \ is flying into a new country with only a bag of clothes and a passport to identify\
  \ yourself.  A few moments passed and I recieved a text from my mother.  I had asked\
  \ her advice since I was afraid to see his family in a foreign setting, especially\
  \ going by myself, but I felt like I might miss out on something wonderful.  My\
  \ mother then proceeded to give me the most conscientious advice I've recieved to\
  \ this day.  \"I totally would [have gone] and you know that, that's why you called\
  \ me... It's what we do! How big a suitcase do you need?\".  That's when I knew\
  \ I was meant to take the trip.  I booked my ticket through the expedia app, packed\
  \ my sister's suitcase with swimsuits and warm weather clothes, grabbed my passport\
  \ and drove my car over to my mother's house for a final goodbye for the next few\
  \ weeks.  \"Be safe, be smart,  but have fun.  You're young and deserve to explore.\
  \  I love you.  Text me when you land.\"  \n\nThe next 19 hours were filled with\
  \ an absolute rush of energy and an independence that I had known but had not nearly\
  \ touched me until that sleepless flight.  I spoke very little spanish, so landing\
  \ in the Guadalajara airport and navigating it was difficult to say the least. \
  \ My heart pounded as I tried to mix ASL and English with the tiny bit of spanish\
  \ I had learned in gradeschool, hopefully describing an airplane and not a very\
  \ large animal with wings to a dozen airport attendants all looking at me like I\
  \ had been possessed by the spirit of La Llarona.\n\n Once I finally found my way\
  \ to boarding my second plane and got to cancun, it was unlike anything I had ever\
  \ experienced in my recallable youth.  It was so humid, I felt my skin was warm\
  \ and wet constantly.  The hustle and bustle of the airport and the people on the\
  \ streets on my way to the hotel weren't like the regular Californians I saw on\
  \ the daily, they weren't on cell phones walking through the streets or plugged\
  \ into a cybernetic world, they were open to their surroundings and completely aware.\
  \  The hotel was beautiful and exotic, with plants I had never seen before and waterfalls\
  \ at every turn.  There were long beautiful beaches and the restaurants and buffets\
  \ had more food than I had ever seen in my life. \n\nThe activities we had planned\
  \ took us on long dirt roads to cenotes and jungle caves, with long exhilarating\
  \ ziplines and preserved mineral enriched waters to scuba dive in that were thousands\
  \ of years old.  I was in a different world, and I didn't get to explore all of\
  \ it.  \n\nOn the second to last day of the trip, I stood with my toes at the edge\
  \ of a platform over a hundred feet tall, strapped to a long wire with a large angled\
  \ stick as my \"brake\".  I was frozen in thought.  It was as if the climax of the\
  \ movie I was starring in had come to a stop as I could see nothing but jungle tree\
  \ tops before me and a long line to take me down to a lagoon, and my brain began\
  \ to scream with anxiety at me.  Suddenly, I closed my eyes and thought about how\
  \ much it took for me to get there, how I peaked at the top of my comfort zone and\
  \ it lead me to this moment.  The wind whistled, the birds cawed, and as if it was\
  \ my instinct from birth, I jumped.  I leaped just as I had done 5 days before,\
  \ into a beautiful unknown.  By the time I reached the end, I couldn't wait to do\
  \ it again."
