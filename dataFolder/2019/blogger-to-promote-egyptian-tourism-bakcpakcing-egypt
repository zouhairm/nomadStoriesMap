Text: "Hey guys, \n\nThis is Mustafa Zaher 21 years old turning 22 and traveled to\
  \ 22 countries before, project manager of Backpacking Egypt? Yes, the biggest volunteering\
  \ project in Egypt, the aim of the project is basically is promoting tourism here\
  \ in Egypt through the materials and the output of each trip. \n\nHow i became the\
  \ project manager?\n \nBack to 2017, i was just a normal student in the \"German\
  \ University in Cairo\" studying Engineering mechatronics unfortunately and this\
  \ was my second year i took my decision to join an organization as an EP \"Exchange\
  \ participant\" and i went to volunteer with them in China, i chose this country\
  \ as i wanted to start a new year in a new country which is totally different to\
  \ go to a country abroad for the first time totally alone and see what's gonna happen,\
  \ so i went there lived there for 5/6 weeks and my project was basically teaching\
  \ children and some students English, but for 2 weeks the project was not working\
  \ cause there was a Chinese festival going on so i took my decision and i started\
  \ backpacking China in my own don't know anything about Chinese language or even\
  \ any thing that i can use as translator but i did and i survived also it was my\
  \ favorite part of the exchange, Then, i came back to my project after i traveled\
  \ around 10 cities in China or more, then when i arrived back i realized how amazing\
  \ that project and how the students were welcoming me for coming back to them and\
  \ how much they loved me and especially when i was leaving the country at the end\
  \ of the project and at the time i realized how i really impacted in those kids\
  \ and got connected to my friends there, so i took my decision to join this organization\
  \ when i came back in order to keep doing the thing that i loved which is making\
  \ an impact wherever i am, then they chose me to be part of Backpacking Egypt for\
  \ the first time i worked on that project really hard and then when it worked out\
  \ i was extremely happy about how the project was amazing, how much the people who\
  \ joined us enjoyed and how i truly felt the impact that happened to each one of\
  \ them because of us and at the same time the output that came out of the project\
  \ was more than amazing then i traveled to Berlin in the start of 2018 i moved to\
  \ there for 6 months as a semester exchange and during this stay i traveled around\
  \ too much that i couldn't even experience Berlin that much then i came back to\
  \ Egypt i have been chosen as a support for the project then they selected me as\
  \ a project manager now for the project!!!\n\nThe main purpose of Backpacking Egypt\
  \ and how the project works?\n\nBackpacking Egypt is a volunteering project here\
  \ in Egypt working on promoting Egyptian tourism through the output of the project\
  \ that the guys who join us from all over the world do, the interns with us get\
  \ sessions in the first two weeks with professionals in each field we have either\
  \ \"photography/videography/social media/BLOGGING\" in order to get them prepared\
  \ enough for the work that they will do in the trip which is like we travel through\
  \ 10 cities here in Egypt in 14 days, here you can find in this link the output\
  \ of the project when i joined it for the first time : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgeERICnq_o\n\
  \nHow this scholarship will help me in my life?\n\nThis scholarship will help me\
  \ a lot to gain more and learn more about how to market and write about a city which\
  \ i will use it later in my project and i will teach the volunteers who will join\
  \ me as well how they can write about each city we visit and about Egypt in general\
  \ so i'm really INTERESTED IN this scholarship and i would really love if you guys\
  \ selected me for it and i'm sure that i will do my best in such a thing to gain\
  \ more for myself, THANK YOUUUUUU!!!"
