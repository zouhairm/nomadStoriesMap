Text: "When I was seven I watched a documentary about the mysteries of Machu Picchu\
  \ in Peru. Since then I have always dreamed of crossing alone the 3,500 kilometers\
  \ that separate the Incas sacred city from Brasilia, capital of Brazil, where I\
  \ live. More than twenty years past until I could afford the two most needed equipment\
  \ for my trip: time and money at a once.\n\nAfter decades of planning, I was living.\
  \ The original idea was to cross Bolivia as fast as I could, spend around two weeks\
  \ in Peru and return to Bolivia to visit the Salar de Uyuni and decide if I would\
  \ head to Chile or visit others cities in Bolivia. I was going without know when\
  \ I would came back.  \n\nSeventeen days later, the cities of Puno, Arequipa, Nazca,\
  \ Cusco, Aguas Calientes and of course Machu Picchu had presented themselves and\
  \ all its diversity, history and touching gastronomy to me. I met incredible people\
  \ like Cecilia, a Spanish girl that warned me \"in Cusco you do not feel the time\
  \ passing, I intended to stay a week and it\u2019s been six months\", or the Peruvian\
  \ Edgardo, in whose house I stayed for three days, he told me all about the German\
  \ anthropologist, Maria Reichie, who devoted her whole life to understand and preserve\
  \ the Nazca Lines, \u201Cif wasn\u2019t for her work a lot of figures  could be\
  \ destroyed by roads now \". \n\nWhen I crossed again the border between Peru and\
  \ Bolivia I knew that I had realized a dream, but I didn\u2019t feel that I had\
  \ realized a dream. That magic moment when everything seems whole and perfect had\
  \ not happened to me. Maybe it was this, maybe these things only happen in movies,\
  \ or who knows the moment had passed without me realizing it.\n\nI disembarked in\
  \ Uyuni on a cold night and immediately was surrounded by a pack of tourist agents.\
  \ I contracted the two nights and three days tour and was taken to the agency to\
  \ wait the rest of the group and leave. A few hours later the driver and guide Jose,\
  \ I, two Portuguese women, two Germans and an Australian, took off  to face the\
  \ lasts blows of winter.\n\nOn the second night, after having visited a train cemetery,\
  \ an island of giant cacti in the middle of the desert, traversed more than 10,000\
  \ square kilometers of white hexagons that form the famous Salar and contemplated\
  \ the amazing laguna morada  with its shades of red, pink and purple, the magic\
  \ finally happened.\n\nI was in the hostel where I would spend the night, sleep\
  \ in that cold would be impossible. After dinner some tourists ventured searching\
  \ a nearby bar, some went to bed, others were chatting and I was worried. Despite\
  \ doing a dozen degrees below zero on the outside, I felt an irresistible urge to\
  \ be alone. I put on all my warm clothes and walked into the silence of the night.\n\
  \nAs I pulled away, I contemplated a clean, starry sky and wondered in disbelief\
  \ and excitement. \"Is it possible that this white trail in the sky is the Milky\
  \ Way?\". I have never seen it before. At that moment the generator's electricity\
  \ was gone, and the fuller darkness involved my eyes. In front of me was the Milky\
  \ Way in its entire splendor, a bridge of stars that linked one end of the horizon\
  \ to the other, but also linked Ayuni to Brasilia and the woman of today to that\
  \ seven year old little girl who once dreamed of traveling. \n\nAfter crying for\
  \ ten minutes, I could already go back home because I had found what I was looking\
  \ for without knowing, a bridge to myself. Even though in my country I am not able\
  \ to see the Milk Way, I know it is still there whenever I need a way crossing time\
  \ and space."
