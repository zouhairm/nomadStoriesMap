Text: "So it wasn't the first time that I was travelling to Manali, I'd been there\
  \ thrice earlier and each time I would breathe the air of Manali, I'd feel home.\n\
  \nThis time I was pretty lucky to go there during the Winter Carnival (happens in\
  \ the month of January/February) when Mall Road is all lit up and locals and tourists\
  \ spend a great time either shopping or eating or participating in fun games.\n\n\
  By the time I reached my hotel and got freshened up, it was evening and I decided\
  \ to take a stroll down the Mall Road. What I experienced after that will be one\
  \ of the most favorite chapters of my life.\n\nSo while I was walking down the road\
  \ I heard loud Punjabi music at around a corner and being a fan of Punjabi songs\
  \ I got tempted to go in that direction. The whole vibe was very electric, popped\
  \ up and full of energy. It was coming from an open truck which was set up in the\
  \ form of a mini stage and had an LED screen advertising about Kings XI Punjab IPL\
  \ team. Just when I reached, the host (a popular RJ from Delhi) came up on the stage\
  \ and announced that he was going to begin with some games and asked who'd like\
  \ to play. I shot my hand in the air instantly and was noticed by him too. He called\
  \ me up and then began a series of some really cool and funny games. Without sounding\
  \ too boastful I'd like to mention that I was pretty good and kept winning and kept\
  \ sailing past the next few rounds.\n\nAfter a couple of games I could see crowd\
  \ gathering around our truck/stage. Oh yes, by the way, the games were like- naming\
  \ 25 cosmetic brand names without stopping in a minute, naming some weird Rajasthani\
  \ dishes, et al. Finally came the final round where I had to bat and hit the ball\
  \ with the twist that I was blindfolded.\nWhen I finished playing the last round\
  \ I saw almost the entire city including most of the locals gathered up there and\
  \ cheering for me. I was elated, beyond any words can truly express! Icing on the\
  \ cake was when I was asked to sing a song (yeah I told them that I sing during\
  \ the games round). I sang an old favorite song on friendship- Yaaron dosti.\n\n\
  The night sky, the stars, the twinkling lights, mic on my hand, the crowd cheering\
  \ me to sing once more- all of it was so surreal. I felt like I went there for a\
  \ concert of mine. My first mini concert performance turned out to be at a city\
  \ which was not where I was born or grew up or lived.\n\nThe connect with the crowd\
  \ that I experienced in those few hours took me by surprise. They showered me with\
  \ so much love and warmth despite me coming from another city. That moment kind\
  \ of absorbed in me so much so that I can still feel them right now by just writing\
  \ about it.\n\nWhen I got off the stage I got a chance to speak to some of them\
  \ and I'm still Fb friends with a few of them. Just after about 10 minutes I was\
  \ surrounded by people all around and with the help of a little nervous organizers\
  \ I was made to exit by another way and rushed from the vicinity safely. This definitely\
  \ gave me a \"kind of celebrity feeling\". And if this wasn't enough, my performance\
  \ footage was there on the local channels the next day, my pictures were there on\
  \ the local magazine too.\n\nSo this trip of Manali only proved that I have a deep\
  \ connect with this place from the past and it's a home discovered by me about which\
  \ I am super grateful and delighted.\n\nPlanning a trip to Manali? I'm ready! Excitement\
  \ level \U0001F4AF%."
