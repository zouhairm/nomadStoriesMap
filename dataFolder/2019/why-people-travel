Text: "Why people travel?\n\nWhy people travel?\nMaybe because it\u2019s their goal\
  \ to go there.\nMaybe for a proposal.\nA wedding.\nMaybe because for their love\
  \ ones.\nTo meet them---to be with them.\n\nWhat if there is a girl. Dreaming.\n\
  Dreaming of herself walking, running, and riding, passing all the paths of that\
  \ different places, and she\u2019s wearing her brightest smile that the people she\
  \ know, her closest friends, and her loving family. Didn\u2019t know that she can\
  \ smile like that, happier, and be confident like that, because there is a feeling\
  \ attacking her that she shouldn\u2019t let that out. Telling her, \u201CIt wasn\u2019\
  t beautiful.\u201D That is why she was afraid to show it. There is someone stopping\
  \ her to smile on the brightest. Someone but herself. \n\nStepping out in her comfort\
  \ zone, makes herself, her. By travelling, she wasn\u2019t afraid to communicate---to\
  \ interact to the people she doesn\u2019t know at all. She wasn\u2019t afraid of\
  \ showing the smile she hide.\n\nShe smiled from the day she know that she is free.\
  \ That finally, \u201CI am free to be me.\u201D No judgemental eyes, no lying mouths,\
  \ and most of all no one can make her feel lonely.\n\nShe might be travelling alone\
  \ by herself, but she never been loved by being lonely by herself than being with\
  \ everyone, but still can feel loneliness.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean that you are\
  \ with them, you are already loved. Sometimes, you need to gain the love you wanted,\
  \ just like the trust. No one will trust you if you don\u2019t show them that you\u2019\
  re a trustworthy person.\n\nThis dreamer girl, she is loved. But she never felt\
  \ the love she deserve. Love isn\u2019t just giving love. Love is giving CARE, APPRECIATION\
  \ , ACCEPTANCE , and RESPECT. Giving, having, and receiving these four. That is\
  \ love. True love. The greatest love a person---a human, and to all living creatures\
  \ in this world could ever have.\n\nThis girl. This girl who\u2019s dreaming at\
  \ walking, running, and riding in nowhere. She found her greatest love at travelling.\
  \ Travelling alone.\n\nWhy people Travel?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just being with someone,\
  \ but it was also about being with yourself."
