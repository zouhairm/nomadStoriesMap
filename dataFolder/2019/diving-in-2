Text: "Two hours since touchdown, the car is yet to arrive to carry us on to the small\
  \ village I will call home for the next two weeks.  \u201CIsland time\u201D, someone\
  \ remarks, playfully reminding us of Samoa\u2019s oft-cited laidback culture.  But\
  \ we soon have wheels and begin to make our way south, then east.  We pass brightly\
  \ painted houses surrounded by lush, green palm trees and my hair becomes frizzy\
  \ in the humidity.\n\nBy the time we reach the bottom of Upolu, the country\u2019\
  s main island, all we see is the road.  Finally, a rise.  The bright yellow words\
  \ \u201CPoutasi-Fale\u0101lili\u201D appear on a pink arched sign, a gateway to\
  \ Upolu\u2019s underside.  We follow the long road down and are welcomed by a large\
  \ grin belonging to Joe, the village chief \u2013 or \u2018matai\u2019 \u2013 holding\
  \ his ukulele in hand.  \u201CTalofa!\u201D, he calls and we are each gifted a lava\
  \ lava (wraparound) to wear, as is custom for the villagers.  \n\nThere is a lingering\
  \ stillness that pervades the village only four years on from a tsunami that ravaged\
  \ the Pacific and, in particular, Poutasi.  Wide patches of barren soil remain where\
  \ debris long lay and there are a lack of permanent structures.  A community just\
  \ shy of 400 residents, nine people were lost on that day \u2013 one of them Joe\u2019\
  s wife.  But Poutasi\u2019s resilience is clear, much like Joe\u2019s ever-present\
  \ smile, and there is determination to rebuild.  We meet Manu, a young bricklayer\
  \ who is one of those helping to construct a new village fale and I notice tiny\
  \ signs of greenery pushing their way back up through areas of dark dirt.\n\nOnly\
  \ the church appears untouched.  Its colours are striking \u2013 white with borders\
  \ of royal blue \u2013 and it stands tall, a symbol of the community\u2019s faith\
  \ and determination.  On Sunday, I attend the service along with every Poutasi resident.\
  \  Inside, their singing voices ring out in perfect harmony.  The words are Samoan\
  \ and I do not understand, but I can sense the meaning through the congregation\u2019\
  s refrain.  It is melodious, happy, and sincere;  a village united.  \n\nI arise\
  \ to the ocean\u2019s waves and panikeke (banana fritters) over the following days.\
  \  At one point, we make a trip to the small school across the road.  Its library\
  \ shelves are overflowing with donated books.  The librarian, Sefina, laments. \
  \ \u201CI wish we had received new donations instead of people burdening us with\
  \ things they don\u2019t want.\u201D  Her tone is apologetic but I scan the shelves.\
  \  There are self-improvement guides, Auckland street directories, and photography\
  \ manuals.  I wonder how these will help students with their maths and history,\
  \ and we help Sefina sort through it all.\n\nOn Wednesday, Manu leads us on a fishing\
  \ trip.  In a small boat, we sail even further south to Nu\u2019usafee Island, a\
  \ small patch of terrain in the ocean south of Poutasi\u2019s shores.  We land on\
  \ sand crawling with hermit crabs, met with thick, green overgrowth and azure water.\
  \  It is everyone\u2019s first experience spearfishing.  \u201CI am Poutasi\u2019\
  s best fisherman\u201D, Manu jokes but it\u2019s no lie \u2013 no one can match\
  \ the skill and dexterity he has from years of tradition.  Once we have our lunch,\
  \ we cook the fish in a fire over coconut leaves.  The latter curl around the fish,\
  \ hugging it, and smoke wafts above us as we watch on in a circle.  \n\nBack on\
  \ the mainland, there is more smoke.  The men of the village have gathered to skin\
  \ a pig for a traditional umu.  I offer to help another villager gather coconuts\
  \ and we later dine on Joe\u2019s deck overlooking the ocean.  I can see my efforts\
  \ have contributed to tasty palusami, a blend of coconut milk and taro leaves. \
  \ As the sun creeps lower, Joe plays his ukulele and, once again, music connects\
  \ us as we laugh and sing ABBA songs under the stars.  \n\nOur last day is spent\
  \ at Papase\u2019ea Sliding Rocks \u2013 best described as natural waterslides \u2013\
  \ with Manu, who we have become close to in a short time.  Perched atop of my rock,\
  \ I reflect on how welcome and connected to the village I feel.  As I slide and\
  \ splash down, I am so glad to have taken the dive in."
