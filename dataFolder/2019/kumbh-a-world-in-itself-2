Text: "So I asked myself again.. Are you sure u want do this?\n\nIn zippy came my\
  \ reply \"No!\"\n\nI turned to my parents & said, \"I am not going to Kumbh\u201D\
  . And then, what I dreaded the most, started: emotional blackmail. I could take\
  \ all of that no more, so I agreed to go with little or no idea of what awaits me\
  \ there.\n\nNow that I am back from the Kumbh, I feel it would have been the biggest\
  \ mistake of my life had I not been there.\n\nSo begins my journey to the world\u2019\
  s largest religious gathering, The Ardh Kumbh, organized in Prayagraj (formerly\
  \ known as Allahabad) in India, which commenced on 15th Jan till 4th March in 2019,\
  \ held at the Triveni Sangam, the meeting points of three rivers \u2013 the Ganga,\
  \ Yamuna & mythical Sarasvati.\nOne can witness the massive gathering of people\
  \ from all over the world who believe that one dip in the holy water of Sangam,\
  \ will unleash them from the burden of their committed sins of all their past lives\
  \ & the present one too.\n\nStarted from Jaipur, I drove around 700kms to Prayagraj\
  \ in a single day. Thanks to the recent development, the roads are too good. However\
  \ Prayagraj was all together a different story. Millions of people coming to mela,\
  \ ends up creating traffic jam where crossing 100 mtrs will take hours, exhausting\
  \ you. \n\nIs it of worth? Definitely.\n\nOnce I reached Kumbh city which falls\
  \ on the outskirts of Allahabad, I forgot all my frustration looking at overflow\
  \ of Indian culture and the beautiful set up which stretches across 25kms on both\
  \ sides of the river. \n\nMassive right! It indeed is!\n\nFor many of us, our knowledge\
  \ of the Kumbh Mela comes from popular fiction \u2013 a large religious fair attended\
  \ by scores of people where families usually get separated sometimes for lifetime.\
  \ But very few of us know the significance of the Mela. It\u2019s origin can be\
  \ traced back to Hindu mythology. According to legend, during the churning of the\
  \ sea when the Amrit, (elixir of immortality) came up, a fight broke out between\
  \ the gods & demons. To keep this elixir away from demons, Lord Vishnu transformed\
  \ into his female avatar, Mohini & carried it away to a secure location. Mohini\
  \ accidentally spilled four drops of the Amrit along the way. These four locations\
  \ \u2013 Haridwar, Ujjain, Prayagraj & Nashik \u2013 are now the venues of the Kumbh\
  \ Mela where people gather in large numbers to wash away their sins & attain salvation.\
  \ \n\nThe day was spent taking a dip in the Sangam, roaming around camps, visiting\
  \ religious shops, meeting Sadhus, clicking pictures, exploring the fort & temples.\
  \ Once the sun sets, the city transforms entirely. The moon light falls on the sand\
  \ & sparkles the whole Kumbh city.\n\nOne of the vivid feature of Kumbh, are Naga\
  \ Sadhu's. These holy men are often seen with coils of matted hair & naked bodies\
  \ smeared with holy ash. They usually carry a trident that are crowned with human\
  \ skulls. While they look fierce, these sadhus are the most non-violent group of\
  \ people, who have renounced all materialistic goods & become one with nature living\
  \ a life of oblivion & avoiding human contact. Given this, they do not appear in\
  \ public with the exception of the Kumbh Mela. It is interesting to capture these\
  \ holy men at the mela as they too partake in the rituals to devoid their soul of\
  \ sin.\n\nLast but the most important thing: Khaana! Be it anywhere, a foodie like\
  \ me hunts for scrumptious, luscious & mouthwatering food! So, even in the Kumbh\
  \ I managed to find stalls which served hot jalebi's, bread pakoda's , methi pakodas,\
  \ bhajias & lot of more stuff! Not to forget with a khatti-meethi chutney to die\
  \ for. \n\nTo conclude, I would just say believer or nonbeliever of the Kumbh. Take\
  \ that leap of faith; Just like I did. To experience the biggest & largest religious\
  \ event in world; to discover a world which is hidden in this small world! It's\
  \ time to forget your apprehensions & plunge into the ocean of possibilities."
