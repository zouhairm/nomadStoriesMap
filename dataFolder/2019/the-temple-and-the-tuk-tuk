Text: "I shook the last drop of water onto my tongue, wiped the sweat from my brow,\
  \ and discarded my bottle. By noon, I had already inquired at four travel agencies\
  \ and asked nine tuk tuk drivers, but was still no closer to locating the mysterious\
  \ Cambodian temple. The two companions I had enlisted to help me with this task,\
  \ beaten down by the relentless heat and ever-declining prospects that this fabled\
  \ Wat Ey Sey actually existed, had already abandoned me. I was alone, searching\
  \ for a place that might not have been, with only my tenacity and pride to eschew\
  \ the prospect of surrender. \n\nI didn\u2019t know if this temple--this Wat Ey\
  \ Sey--was real. I had scrounged bits and pieces alluding to its existence online,\
  \ and had only heard admissions of failure from the throngs of backpackers who had\
  \ searched before. But after an entire day of inquiries, my spirit was battered.\
  \ I even imagined that success might come in the form of some wizened sage descending\
  \ from the clouds to deliver an invitation in recognition of my dedication. \n\n\
  That sage turned out to be a tuk tuk driver by the name of Johnny. He was somehow\
  \ the only driver in Kampot to know about Wat Ey Sey, but he made good on his promise.\
  \ We drove a good hour out of town, and he accompanied me for another 3-hour climb\
  \ up a steep remote mountain. The entire trek was surreal. Although the trail was\
  \ poorly-worn, we saw no animals. Although we were in the middle of the forest,\
  \ we saw no insects. And, waiting for us at the peak was an abnormally large staircase\
  \ and steps that I surmised could only have been designed for giants. \n\nAscending\
  \ the behemoth, I breathed in the serenity of the mountain air, and as my eyes adjusted\
  \ to the unfettered brightness, I witnessed the tranquil temple. Slightly dehydrated\
  \ and suffering from mild heat exhaustion, I blinked twice and assured myself it\
  \ was real. \n\nApparently Wat Ey Sey was still an active temple, and monks from\
  \ all around would travel here on a regular basis. The village, nested alongside\
  \ the temple, housed 20 or so people who would take care of the monks. Visitors\
  \ were infrequent, and the villagers invited us in and cooked us food. Johnny translated\
  \ what he could for me, but as travelers often have to do in foreign lands, I mostly\
  \ relied on the universal language of smiles, kindness, and gratitude. \n\nFinding\
  \ Wat Ey Sey was an adventure, and if you want to follow in my footsteps: I can\
  \ only recommend that you look for the tuk tuk with a green motorbike, often idling\
  \ outside the only ribs joint in town. Bring him some palm wine. Tell him I sent\
  \ you. Whether he remembers me will be your own story to tell."
