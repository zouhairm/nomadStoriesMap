Text: "It was June 2009 and I had finally arrived in Siena, Tuscany after a long flight\
  \ and bus ride. It was pouring rain and sheets of water greeted me instead of the\
  \ sunny Tuscan countryside I had expected! On top of that, I was jet-lagged and\
  \ the directions to the hotel we\u2019d to received didn\u2019t make sense (this\
  \ was before Waze existed and Wi-Fi was readily available). No one seemed to speak\
  \ English and I was starting to panic. Originally excited about this six week National\
  \ Endowment for the Humanities seminar on the life of St. Francis of Assisi and\
  \ the opportunity to spend the summer traveling around Italy, I now began to question\
  \ whether this was a good idea. Maybe I should\u2019ve just stayed at home and relaxed\
  \ all summer like most of my fellow teachers, instead of traveling in a country\
  \ where everything seemed different and challenging (I later read that of Europeans,\
  \ Italians are the least well versed in the English language).\n\nI eventually found\
  \ my hotel with some help from locals who pointed me in the right direction. I was\
  \ in a daze and frustrated but somehow with some gesturing and pointing was able\
  \ to find the alley where the hotel entrance was. It was a simple building and room\
  \ that was actually part of a convent. Every morning the sparrows woke me up as\
  \ they flew around and chirped when the sun rose, which was rather annoying. But\
  \ I learned to accept it as part of the experience and because I couldn\u2019t change\
  \ it. Plus I was in Italy for six glorious weeks! As time went on, I settled in\
  \ and became more comfortable. I learned a few Italian words and when we weren\u2019\
  t in class or visiting a museum, church or historic site, I would wander around\
  \ Siena and then Assisi where we stayed for the second part of the seminar. I enjoyed\
  \ people watching, grabbing gelato and eating Italian food every night.\n\nWhen\
  \ we had a free long weekend, I was determined to go to Urbino to see the great\
  \ Renaissance ducal palace. No one else in the group was interested in joining me\
  \ and I was happy to go on my own, something I have done a lot as I\u2019ve continued\
  \ to travel. I took the train and spent the night in Pesaro, a beach town on the\
  \ Adriatic Sea, where I enjoyed some beach time before taking the bus the next day\
  \ to Urbino. It is not a big tourist destination but was an important center of\
  \ Renaissance learning and entertainment with an impressive ducal palace that I\u2019\
  d read and taught about. \n\nAfter six wonderful weeks, I did not want to leave\
  \ this beautiful country. I learned and saw a lot and was now bitten by the travel\
  \ bug. Without this trip, I am not sure I would\u2019ve continued to travel and\
  \ explore new places. Since then, I have made recommendations to friends and relatives\
  \ who have sought my advice, posted photos and stories on my Facebook page and incorporated\
  \ what I\u2019ve learned into lesson plans. I've also learned ways to research and\
  \ plan trips, map things out and be flexible when things don't quite work out or\
  \ when having to make a change to the itinerary. Some of my best moments traveling\
  \ have been the unexpected--snorkeling at the Bay of Pigs, Cuba; walking into a\
  \ beautiful synagogue not frequented by tourists in Gyor, Hungary; being one of\
  \ the first American groups to visit the Point Alpa Museum and Foundation in Geisa,\
  \ Germany. I\u2019ve learned that not everything needs to be planned out. It\u2019\
  s important to allow time to wander, chat with locals, ask for recommendations and\
  \ sometimes just go with the flow! Traveling isn't easy and comes with frustrations\
  \ and challenges. As the late Anthony Bourdain once said, \u201CTravel changes you.\
  \ As you move through this life and this world you can change things slightly, you\
  \ leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life - and travel leaves marks\
  \ on you.\u201D I\u2019ve found this to be very true and it\u2019s why I keep traveling\
  \ and also want to try a new career as a travel writer."
