Text: "The rain was pouring upon the windows of my small room of the chalet where\
  \ I was staying for the weekend, washing with every drop of rain the background\
  \ voices in my head. I was laying on my back with my feet hanging in the air trying\
  \ to understand the strong feeling of anxiety that lead me to this exile. The sun\
  \ was shining surprisingly strong through the big leaves of the trees, leaving its\
  \ warmth to dry almost instantly the wet soil. The rain stopped. No matter how much\
  \ I would like to relax, enjoy the beautiful weather and nature, clear my mind,\
  \ I cannot. My mind is going crazy over the same things that keep me up at night\
  \ for months already. And I cannot even name it! It is just full of hollow thoughts\
  \ that do not go anywhere, or at least this is what I am feeling now. \nI risen\
  \ up annoyed from the bed and I went outside. The air was fresh, the sun was shining\
  \ and the temperature was perfect. I was in the woods, after the rain, my favorite\
  \ period and place and I cannot feel a thing. I started walking and I saw a snail\
  \ trying to make his way through the pile of leaves. I looked at him while he was\
  \ trying to climb a rock. The trail which he left behind was shinny, wet and slimy.\
  \ I touched it while making a face. It was creamy and repulsing. I sat by the snail\
  \ in lotus position and I watched him. Suddenly I was back at my grandparents\u2019\
  \ house, in the summer. I was 6 years old and I was playing in the mud created by\
  \ a rainy night. I was putting my hand in it, felt its coldness which I enjoyed.\
  \ The house's dog appeared and I started running with him when I stepped on something.\
  \ I stopped, looked back to see where was the sound coming from, I saw a smashed\
  \ snail and I kept running towards the dog. The life didn't matter then. Now, watching\
  \ the snail on the rock I was feeling some empathy. Still, only my life matters,\
  \ what happens to me, what should I do, how will my life be, who will I become.\
  \ \nBut I cannot ignore the empathy that I am feeling by just watching the snail\
  \ making his way through life. The feeling that I understand someone else's actions,\
  \ that I can cry or laugh with him, the connection maybe. I started to feel sad\
  \ and melancholic, to think about the passing life, about everything and everyone.\
  \ I told myself that this is a good thing, at least I am feeling something. I became\
  \ more and more self conscious and the feeling started to fade away. My eyes got\
  \ anost again and I started walking again with the tiny hope that I will find something\
  \ else on my path and I will, maybe, live a little bit more soon."
