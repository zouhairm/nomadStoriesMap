Text: "It has been a while since D told me that \"Mexico is the dream!\" His exact\
  \ words. Me being from another Latin country, didn't give too much credit this.\
  \ We all sort of come from the same place. Geographically and historically speaking\
  \ I am not wrong. I also have my Latin roots, but haven't been able to explore it\
  \ more than a few years since my family moved out of the country many years ago.\
  \ I made some plans to visit Mexico, wrote dates in my diary and looked for tickets\u2019\
  \ countless times. it was never the right time for a while. Until that \"kairos\"\
  \ happened. The meaning of this word is \"propitious moment for decision or action.\"\
  . This is what happened. An opportunity just appeared. Free tickets with a small\
  \ amount of work and I couldn't escape the chance to come see what was so exiting\
  \ about this place. \" It's the real Mexico of Mexico! With the Banda, Tequila and\
  \ the Mariachi. Man, you will fall in love. Many do.\" \"Okay D\" I got it. With\
  \ my tickets in hand I begin to travel to the unknow.\n\nWhen I arrive at the airport\
  \ the first thing I notice is the smell. That dusty smell just like all the mud\
  \ had dried out and I could see the sand lifting from the airport ground. The staff\
  \ brings these various tons of coffee and chocolate skin as well. All of them smell\
  \ different colognes and perfumes. Not many smiles in the immigration section. They\
  \ look serious until the immigration interview is over. Once you\u2019re done and\
  \ your passport is stamped they raise their head. What you will see are two soft\
  \ eyes with wrinkles on the side that look like they have been smiling for so many\
  \ years. With very well-maintained teeth and the words \u201CEnjoy your stay.\u201D\
  \ the officer sent me away with a smile. For me that almost felt like home already.\n\
  \nWe saw the houses close to Ds. They mostly have 2 floors with a little open yard.\
  \ These houses are not very big like the ones we see in a Hollywood movie. But they\
  \ are big enough to fit in one family and their guests. What I love about them is\
  \ that their colors are so vivid and different. Some have gates others don\u2019\
  t, some have greenery others pure concrete, some have their door open others have\
  \ a big glass window separating the kitchen and the patio. All of them have one\
  \ thing in common, there are people inside. How do I know this?  I can hear the\
  \ music, laughs, the neighbors shouting to see if the other is home, the dogs and\
  \ the children playing. This is a good neighborhood I think to myself. I start to\
  \ see what D meant when he said this is the Mexico of Mexico.\n\nDs mom doesn\u2019\
  t cook much so we go a few houses to the left. There you see that they have opened\
  \ up their patio and put plastic tables as restaurants do. With a simple white and\
  \ red cloth in the middle and a little saucer to hold three kinds of salsa in the\
  \ middle. The older gentleman working there is eating his ice cream looks up at\
  \ us. He says \u201CPasem\u201D meaning we can go in to his property. We sit, choose\
  \ the tacos we are grabbing for dinner that night. I can see Ds mom is a regular\
  \ because she is asking the old man about his health condition and about his children\
  \ as he serves us lemon. She turns and explains that this is a small town. Where\
  \ everyone mostly knows everyone. I don\u2019t know whether I like this or not.\
  \ We take some agua de Jamaica on the way home. Sit at out at the patio to discuss\
  \ our impressions of each other\u2019s countries. While this is happening, more\
  \ acquaintances come to join us. At the end we create a circle of 15 people, just\
  \ catching up and speaking about the different things we saw thought the day and\
  \ travels. \n\nThis was my official welcome to Mexico moment. I won\u2019t lie.\
  \ I completely fell in love with it."
