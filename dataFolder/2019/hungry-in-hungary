Text: "My twin sister, our best friend and myself went travelling around Europe for\
  \ a month in 2017! We had already visited cities such as Amsterdam, Budapest and\
  \ Lake bled, and were on our way to Croatia for a interval-week on the beach! On\
  \ arrival at the train station we were told that our train had departed early, thus\
  \ leaving us stranded for 24 hours until the next direct train. As three adventurers,\
  \ we decided to make our own route to Croatia\u2026easy\u2026right? We hopped aboard\
  \ the next train in the direction of Croatia, however we were told half way through\
  \ Hungary that we we were required to step off the train and get a coach full of\
  \ 50 other passengers to the next train station due to 'unexpected' difficulties.\
  \ All a part of the fun, we did as we were told and ended up in a small station.\
  \ As told by the driver, we hopped aboard the next train to a town pronounced; *gekyniesh*...\
  \ (cannot find it on google\u2026). This is where the trouble begins. It was creeping\
  \ on 10:00pm and the sun had retired with lightning as the only form of visual connection\
  \ to the outside world. As the last passenger got off the train, we were alone,\
  \ in a carriage with broken seats, smashed windows, on a train in which direction\
  \ was unknown to us. As if this wasn't spooky enough, as the train came to our station\
  \ a a fire appeared in the window as if out of a horro film, face covered by his\
  \ coat, holding an AXE! In my life I have never screamed as much! We ran off the\
  \ train, to which my twin sister fell over, rather ironically lightening the mood,\
  \ as we ran into the shutter of a train station in this unknown town. The shutters\
  \ of the tiny little reception (if you want to call it that) were were down, and\
  \ not a train was insight\u2026 we were alone, no food, no water, no bathroom. Despite\
  \ wanting to be as indeed as possible, it was time to call mum for some advice.\
  \ To our surprise the signal wasn't too bad, and so we managed to pin point our\
  \ location on maps to send to her. She soon told us that this haunted-looking station\
  \ was in fact a ten minute forest walk away from a town with a small population\
  \ of 2,000 with one b&b with no images nor information. With the rain pouring down,\
  \ we decided to slum it as true inter-railers and sleep on the floor, with the hope\
  \ that the following morning someone would come and rescue us. With our last remaining\
  \ phone on 1%, with the rising of the sun a tiny foreign woman trotted over to the\
  \ tracks and opened up the shutters of the room full with a desk, and a chair. After\
  \ a painful attempt of a conversation through mixed english, german, Spanish and\
  \ rubbish, we managed to grasp that we were in fact in the correct train station\
  \ the previous day, and had we not re-boarded the train, we would currently be relaxing\
  \ on a beach in Croatia\u2026 With the tears building, it was a \"you've got to\
  \ laugh or you'll cry\" moment so that we did, a lot, and waited for the broken\
  \ down carriage to rescue us to humanity again."
