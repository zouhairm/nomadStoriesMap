Text: "I have started my solo travelling just after taking step into the adulthood,\
  \ at the age of 18 years.  Within these 9 years I have travelled many places across\
  \ my country, India. But the most remarkable Adrenalin adventure was my journey\
  \ to Ladakh at the age of 20. This journey was completely unplanned and my wishful\
  \ leap into the unknown to discover the mystic beauty of nature which ends up by\
  \ discovering the sacred inner-self. I believe you can\u2019t get to know yourself\
  \ properly until and unless you devote yourself into the unknown. It needs courage,\
  \ it needs passion and it needs a strong faith to Universe and to yourself. To me\
  \ adventure towards unknown is the best way to journey inside and since early ages\
  \ saints and philosophers having described the journey inside as the toughest one.\
  \  A journey is not a term carry the meaning of travelling only; it\u2019s a way\
  \ of living, a spiritual path to discover also.\n\nLeh-Ladakh is far away from my\
  \ home town, north most part of India and considered to be one of the less explored\
  \ part of Asia continent. Starting my journey from Kolkata Netaji  Subhash International\
  \ Airport I reached Delhi Indira Gandhi International Airport within 2.30 hrs. .\
  \ From Delhi I travelled for a night to reach Dharamshala (Himachal Pradesh) which\
  \ well known as \u2018little lasha\u2019. Spending 3 days in monasteries I set for\
  \ Manali, one of the picture perfect hill stations of Himalayan range.  I haven\u2019\
  t and hadn\u2019t a regular job and I always loved to manage my living expense by\
  \ myself. So I had to be very careful about the budget also. To make my travel cost\
  \ pocket friendly I took public transport. According to my experience taking public\
  \ transport is both cheaper and safer for a solo female traveller. After exploring\
  \ Manali for 1 day I was all set for my unknown journey. I booked a van car to pursue\
  \ the biggest adventure of my life. The car has started at midnight beside from\
  \ Bisakha River.  Fortunately it was a full moon night and nature was profligate\
  \ in terms of its beauty; river seems to a flow of liquid silver. The road journey\
  \ from Manali to leh takes one and half days and it considered to be one of the\
  \ deadliest journeys. Despite of its imperil nature I must say that, it is one of\
  \ the best road trip one can encounter in his/her life. The highway is approximately\
  \ 500 km long and the beauty beside the way can make anyone crazy.  It is quite\
  \ impossible get rid of the mesmerizing beauty of leh-ladkh region for life time.\
  \  On the way you will have to pass through many magnificent valleys like spiti\
  \ and have to cross many mountains passes like Tanglang la which is the second highest\
  \ pass of the world.  I have heard from the local there is a saying that who can\
  \ cross the road from Manali to Leh he/she can go anywhere in the world. Crossing\
  \ the unforgettable road looking at the shadows of clouds on the mountain was extraordinary.\
  \ When I entered  leh after a day-long journey I got the embrace from  whole Universe\
  \ at that time. May be, if we remain all our windows open we can receive it at any\
  \ time, but often abandon this precious felling unmindfully. I made a promise to\
  \ myself at the time of starting this journey that I will only follow the flow which\
  \ will come naturally and accept the destiny happily. I am happy that I was succeeded\
  \ to keep my promise without giving an extra effort. Would like to end saying;\n\
  \n\u201CI am not a foreigner because I haven\u2019t been praying to return safely\
  \ home, I haven\u2019t wasted my time imagining my house, my desk , my side of the\
  \ bed. I am not a foreigner because we are all travelling; we are all full of the\
  \ same questions, the same tiredness, the same fears, the same selfishness and the\
  \ same generosity. I am not a foreigner because, when I asked, I received. When\
  \ I knocked, the door opened. When I looked, I found.\u201D\n\n-Paulo Coelho, Aleph"
