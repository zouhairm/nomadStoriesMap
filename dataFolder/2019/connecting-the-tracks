Text: "My best friends live far away. They know of my goal to travel to 30 countries\
  \ before I turn 30. I can connect to them through social media, but that's not enough\
  \ for me. I want to meet and talk to them face-to-face. Sometimes it's nice to just\
  \ walk to the train station and head off somewhere. Escape from the pressures off\
  \ work for a little while. I'm bolder when I travel and distant from what I know.\
  \ Embracing the hidden treasures of my own country make days like this make life\
  \ worth living.  \n\nThe United Kingdom takes pride in its multiple cultures. Our\
  \ country is built from a wide range of nationalities and is a humble home to all.\
  \ I went to a disco rave in Birmingham celebrating Korean Pop music. I felt out\
  \ of place with all the breakdancing out there, but I think I may have been the\
  \ oldest there. Despite that, I had a marvellous time. The next morning was a pleasant\
  \ train journey to Darlington where I stayed over at a friend's house. We studied\
  \ Iranian cuisine and even cooked the beloved fesenjan dish. \n\nMy friend had a\
  \ nature reserve not far from her house. We spent the afternoon feeding the ducks\
  \ and greeting dog walkers passing by. We did not travel to the places up north\
  \ as planned, but we are both young and there's still time. We took a different\
  \ path and learned about the inspiration behind her mother's book, the grandfather's\
  \ clock. \n\nFriday I went to London to meet some drinking pals. We attended a convention\
  \ dedicated to video games and anime. I took the day as an opportunity to waltz\
  \ around the Bloomsbury area and discovered a vintage shop that made me feel I had\
  \ warped back in time. Though I spent a bit of time on my own, the people I socialized\
  \ with made me feel like part of the family.\n\nTravel doesn't have to be abroad.\
  \ I believe that travelling is all about finding a new home from home and I feel\
  \ with my friends I've done it. One of them says that every day is an advdenture,\
  \ and I think she's right. This one is far from over."
