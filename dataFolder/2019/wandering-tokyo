Text: "Being a person who rarely travel, especially traveling abroad is the exciting\
  \ and scary feeling I felt at once. People said that travelling is enriched our\
  \ life experience whether is business trip, vacation or anything else. Just like\
  \ an overuse quote \u201Cthe most important things from travelling is not the destination\
  \ but the journey\u201D, after all the destination of all travelling is back to\
  \ where you came from, the \u201Cjourney\u201D I meant not only the trip but also\
  \ the preparation behind it. Me and my wife planning to take vacation to Japan,\
  \ even though I do not know anything about Japan except anime and a glimpse from\
  \ TV. Me and my wife committed to take this trip without using any tour travel services,\
  \ we arrange all of it from scratches. From bought ticket, apply visa, compile itinerary,\
  \ book accommodation and transportation also we take care all of the small things.\
  \  For more than 6 month I prepare all the visa requirement and all other things\
  \ such as accommodation and transportation. The departing day come, and we went\
  \ early to Ngurah Rai International airport to avoid being late and the possibility\
  \ of missed our flight. Our flight is direct from Ngurah Rai International airport\
  \ to Narita International airport.  From Bali to Japan we have to take 7 hours\u2019\
  \ flight, and one of thing that I did not anticipate before is, I did not bring\
  \ snack of food for the flight. . Narita is the town that we put our feet for the\
  \ first time, excitement and mixed feeling in my belly. After we pass the immigration,\
  \ the time has come that we have to take train to go to our hotel which is at down\
  \ town of Tokyo, and the things that we afraid and not anticipate before is come\
  \ to happen which is most of signage are in Japan language and almost none in English.\
  \ We try to ask to the platform officer and they only speak little bit English,\
  \ piece by piece we gather information within an hour and finally we are figure\
  \ out which platform should we took. Unlike Singapore which each platform/rail is\
  \ dedicated for specific route, however in Japan each platform/rail is used by several\
  \ trains with different routes and also with specific time schedule. If we took\
  \ the wrong train, we will end up in the wrong side of the city, so we must be sure\
  \ what train that we\u2019re going to take. Fortunately, we have Google Maps (not\
  \ promoting) which very reliable and most of it accurate, provide us detail schedule\
  \ of each train based on destination we want to go. Google Maps also updated with\
  \ information if there was any train that have problem or late, so we can anticipate\
  \ it and use other train. We have been lost twice in Tokyo, so one tips I recommend\
  \ to you is use other Maps app which provide Train and subway schedule for just\
  \ in case. We were amaze with the scenery of urban life in Tokyo, everyone seems\
  \ in hurry, every people like been chased or chasing something. So many vending\
  \ machine on every side of the road, selling food or beverages, toys, fruits, umbrella,\
  \ souvenirs or flower you named it.  As we walk through Tokyo we saw very mixed\
  \ culture appears, traditional meet modern makes Tokyo very interesting place to\
  \ go, people wearing traditional clothes while they played with their smartphones.\
  \ As we were getting used to the Tokyo life rhythm, we went to several shrine and\
  \ taste the calmness and very solitary place. We felt the sacredness of the place,\
  \ most of the shrine is in the middle of small forest and it became asylum for flora\
  \ and fauna in there. Even the shrine is open for tourist, that place keep emit\
  \ \u201CTaksu\u201D, in Balinese Taksu means sacredness, which make the visitor\
  \ respect the tradition and custom. Each corner of Tokyo gives unexpected and different\
  \ scene, attract people to come and feel the ambient of the city and soak with in.\
  \ Japan always be our special place to remember, every experience we felt and memories\
  \ we share makes us want to go back and peel another part of Japan and live inside\
  \ it."
