Text: "There was a time in my life that seeing monkeys were as commonplace as seeing\
  \ raccoons, both rummaging like tiny criminals through sealed bins like a grand\
  \ heist. But as we walked through the market, weaving in between hotel vans and\
  \ tut tuts towards the river separating Angkor Wat from the 21st century, they seemed\
  \ altogether foreign to me. Foreign in the way that they were completely welcomed,\
  \ unlike in Singapore where man imposed his will (as he usually does) and banished\
  \ the surilis and the macaques to zoos or nature preserves - remember, look with\
  \ your eyes and not with your hands - here, they were as integrated into the ecosystem\
  \ as the chet chien sellers or the mangoes rotting beneath our feet.\n\n\u201CNo\
  \ time for mangos,\u201D Sok Put grinned as he marched ahead, \u201Cwe must make\
  \ it for sunset!\u201D The moment it occurred to me to ask what we were making it\
  \ to was the moment the temple chose to reveal itself. An audible *gasp* synchronized\
  \ itself amongst my family as Sok Put\u2019s smile grew from ear to ear. The first\
  \ thing to greet us was Vishnu himself, strewn in golden silks with petals, every\
  \ shade of red, lain at his feet. Even as the years passed and Buddhism started\
  \ calling Angkor Watt home, the temple\u2019s Hindu roots remain: the gallery halls\
  \ that modern monks walked through to reach their pilgrimage depict the Ramayana\
  \ and the Mahabharata epics, the beams supporting the sacred middle tower are lined\
  \ with sandstone apsara and devata, and the roof overhead the Buddhist place of\
  \ prayer portray heads of lions and gerunds. \n\nIn between the capital temple\u2019\
  s nine century long history lesson, our guide slowly revealed his own. The youngest\
  \ son. A trilingualist. Marvel superfan. And in his final year studying the complexities\
  \ and traumas of his country\u2019s past, Sok Put looks to the wild west with hopes\
  \ of continuing his education at UC Berkeley. \n\n\u201CWe\u2019re from the Bay\
  \ Area!\u201D my family\u2019s youngest son exclaimed. \n\nAs if a smile couldn\u2019\
  t get any bigger! \u201CMaybe one day you\u2019ll be my guide.\u201D he thought\
  \ aloud. But as we made our way to the heart of the temple and climbed the vertical\
  \ steps to the middle tower, I thought how disappointing our tour would be. How\
  \ can one compare the ancient grandness of Cambodia\u2019s jewel with a golden gate,\
  \ only 82 years old? Or the monks in ceremonial prayer robes with the Bay\u2019\
  s unofficial denim uniform? Or the hum of cicadas with the constant rumble of rubber\
  \ tires on tar roads? \n\nAnd then, there it was. Sok Put\u2019s sunset, creeping\
  \ between the pillars and illuminating the tower above. The monks became statues,\
  \ the temple became quiet; and while I can\u2019t speak for the world that seemed\
  \ to fall away past the temple walls, I can assert that at least I was at peace.\
  \ The final light of the day bouncing off of sandstone reminded me of Singapore\u2019\
  s skyline aflame with dusk somehow, and of the way evening smolders off of Edinburgh\u2019\
  s limestone, and even of the golden shine that closes each day in San Francisco.\
  \ \n\nThere\u2019s almost 8,000 miles between Cambodia and California, although\
  \ Angkor Wat to the Golden Gate Bridge seems farther somehow. I hope that the world\
  \ is a small enough place that we meet Sok Put again, that we can walk past the\
  \ graffitied walls depicting the nation\u2019s revolutionary epic, see the crimson\
  \ (not golden) beams supporting a state\u2019s icon, and see the fog ceiling of\
  \ the city by the Bay. I hope he\u2019ll smile like he did when we first met in\
  \ Siem Reap. Though I can\u2019t help but wonder: when he looks out at the rolling\
  \ hills of California, will he miss his Cambodian sunset?"
