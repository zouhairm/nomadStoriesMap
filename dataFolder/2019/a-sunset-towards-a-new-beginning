Text: "The few lyrics of a country song that was able to escape the static from the\
  \ local radio station set the tone for the dirt road Colin and I have been traveling\
  \ on for just under an hour. Finally, we had reached the farthest Western edge of\
  \ Southern Ontario, the only West Coast a couple of twenty-somethings could afford.\
  \ An average summer road trip for many, but paradise to me, as someone who has never\
  \ strayed far from my hometown as a 24 year-old. Four hours away from home we entered\
  \ Goderich. Population: 7,000. \n\nIt was a town at half speed. A town I desperately\
  \ needed for my soul to unwind from a checklist race. College, check, first job,\
  \ check, boyfriend, check. It was time to walk. After facing the loss of a parent\
  \ at 18 and a heart attack just after my 24th birthday, I've never been able to\
  \ live life for me, and I've learned the hard way it's short. I needed to make sure\
  \ I was happy with my path in life. Maybe this place where the sun seemed to shine\
  \ brighter was the first step. \n\nWe decided to stop at the \"Sunset Beach\" before\
  \ checking in to the Airbnb. Even the seagulls sang as the sky lit up and Lake Huron\
  \ was a mirror of fire. The location lived up to its name. A teenager smiled as\
  \ she handed Colin and I our ice cream cones at a beach stop. He tried the flavour\
  \ of the month, I had my predictable, safe, chocolate cone. \n\nI'm a firm believer\
  \ in the little things. Over our four days in Goderich, I had many firsts. First\
  \ time leaving home, first time taking a vacation, but most importantly, the first\
  \ time I shut myself off from everyday society. Apart from of course the lovely\
  \ residents of Goderich, whom I started to suspect weren't aware cell phones existed.\n\
  \nOn the last night in town, Colin and I walked up seven flights of wooden stairs\
  \ from the beach to get a better view of the sunset that was due to start in the\
  \ next hour. Dragging our worn footwear to the last step, we were in awe at the\
  \ sight opposite the water. Countless dragonflies silently draped over rows of a\
  \ rainbow garden. Majestic in itself, it meant so much more to me. My mother loved\
  \ dragonflies, and whenever I see one, I believe it to be a sign everything will\
  \ be okay. In that moment as I then turned to see the most beautiful sunset in my\
  \ life, I knew I was right where I needed to be.\n  \nAs I sat in the passenger\
  \ seat with Goderich in the rear view mirror, I never thought I would find a place\
  \ only hours from home that would provide me such clarity. A little courage, faith\
  \ and travel can lead to magical beginnings."
