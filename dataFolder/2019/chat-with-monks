Text: "The East tempts with its comforting promise of Zen. We hope it will grant us\
  \ that which we did not know we were looking for, yet we\u2019ve been missing. Minimalism.\
  \ Meditation. Monks in orange robes. A sitting Buddha. A peaceful world where salvation\
  \ from our algorithm-conducted western lives awaits. Or does it? My one-way ticket\
  \ to Chiang Mai this year was anything but a trying-to-find-myself journey. I had\
  \ done my homework on that. I do not search for what has never been lost. Instead,\
  \ I set to explore new building blocks to create with.\n \nI arrive at dawn. The\
  \ morning nurtures hope as I step on the land of the world\u2019s most Buddhist\
  \ country. The buildings are architecturally miserable. It smells like frying oil\
  \ and the air is dense with smoke. Occasional perfume island traces of tourists,\
  \ left in the open to vanish, remind me of life\u2019s transience. Yet, this colorful\
  \ city lures foreigners from all over the world and bounds them to stay. Once the\
  \ ancient capital of the kingdom of Lanna, Chiang Mai has transformed into a creative\
  \ hub with explosive 4G connection. There, in between the vibrant life and hippy-like\
  \ westerners, locals in orange robes mingle and smile.\n\nI pick up a taxi from\
  \ the airport to the Co-living space where I will be staying. It is closed for another\
  \ 2 hours. As I sit and wait, I take in the city\u2019s ambiance\u2014busy traffic\
  \ with a dash of monks, walking on imaginary sidewalks. If you do a Google search\
  \ on the best things to do in Chiang Mai, an exotic suggestion comes up\u2014 \u201C\
  Chat with Monks\u201D. The phrase inflames a sequence of thoughts in my mind. Somehow\
  \ the randomness of a chat seems to clash with the profound nature associated with\
  \ a monk. That orange robe which speaks of wisdom just does not fit into the frame\
  \ of a shallow chat. The following days, I explore the city beyond Google\u2019\
  s suggestions, but the monk experience haunts me. I give into my curiosity. \n \n\
  \u201CChat with Monks\u201D is an informal cultural exchange program that allows\
  \ younger monks to practice their English. It is a great way to learn about Buddhism\
  \ and Thai culture while sharing curious facts about yours. Nestled in the Old Town\
  \ of the city, Wat Chedi Luang is one of the more popular and grandiose temples.\
  \ Men dressed in orange robes, sitting under the shade welcome those who wish to\
  \ indulge on their curiosity. No need to Rsvp, so I go.\n \nI spend an afternoon\
  \ in the company of Phra and a few other teenage monks. We talk about their routine,\
  \ their perceptions of life and motives to follow the path of enlightenment. Beyond\
  \ any transcendental reasons, most of them do so because their families are too\
  \ poor to support their education. The spark of curiosity lurks in their eyes. They,\
  \ too, wander about the world, seeking answers in ancient reasonings and beyond.\
  \ To be honest, they seem just as confused as the backpackers beyond the walls of\
  \ the temple.\n \nEven though I am respectfully covered, an initial awkwardness\
  \ stretches in the air. I choose the power of laughter to stir up the tension and\
  \ I ask them to teach me Thai. Laughter is in order! After describing all they need\
  \ to abstain from, such as eating after noon, sex and similar unnatural human activities,\
  \ I am curious whether they have smart phones. They sure do! Thoughts overwhelm\
  \ me. Is it that having a meal in the afternoon sabotages your journey to Zen, but\
  \ being on social media does not? \n \n\u201CChat with a monk\u201D may be an oxymoron\
  \ - a clash between cultures, yet the experience itself is binding. The utopian\
  \ image of the East is wired with the progress of the West. In the womb of globalization,\
  \ comfort and peace are a journey within. Other than that, Chiang Mai is a wonderful\
  \ destination that will add another angle to that 360-degree view of the world."
