Text: "I hand the street vendor a 10 baht piece, which I have fondly come to recognize\
  \ as the big coin with with the gold circle. Coins are valuable here. In the States,\
  \ 10 baht is the value of a stick of gum -- but in Thailand, it is a bag of pineapple\
  \ and pale pink spices, a savory chicken skewer, a mini crepe filled with pillowy\
  \ cream. Right now, it buys me mango sticky rice. Everything feels warm and sweet\
  \ as we walk around in the sun. \n\nTitang has taken me to a city called Pattaya,\
  \ a small beach town by the looks of it. Though I have only been studying in Thailand\
  \ for a few months, I feel closer to Titang, or \u201CSweet Tea\u201D as I call\
  \ her, than some of my friends in Texas. \n\n\u201CWatch out!\u201D She yells as\
  \ we walk by a group of children that are armed and ready with water guns. \n\n\
  I\u2019m too late. The kids laugh, watching me clutch my sticky rice as they soak\
  \ me through. To ring in Thai New Year, there is a water festival called Songkran\
  \ in which Thais and tourists alike fill the streets and splash each other. \n\n\
  \u201CT, let\u2019s go!\u201D I grab Titang\u2019s hand and we run the other direction.\
  \ A tuk tuk drives by, and always on the same wavelength, we both hop in. Our water\
  \ guns bop around on our laps, rising and falling with each bump in the road. The\
  \ wind whips at my hair, drying my body and clothes. I close my eyes, again thinking\
  \ about how wonderful the sun feels on my skin. All of a sudden, though, something\
  \ feels off. I open my eyes and finally notice the other people in the tuk tuk.\n\
  \n\u201CWhere do you want to go?\u201D The voice belongs to an older white man.\
  \ He has deeply set lines etched into his face, and his eyebrows are furrowed in\
  \ a way that can only be described as angry. \n\n\u201CAnywhere.\u201D The girl\
  \ beside him is beautiful. Her skin is the color of caramel and I cannot help but\
  \ admire how shiny her hair looks. I wonder if she is in her early 20\u2019s like\
  \ me. Despite her soft, kind-looking features, something about the couple strikes\
  \ me as odd. I turn to Titang, but she is staring at her phone, scrolling through\
  \ pictures from earlier that day. \n\nI happen to look back at the couple right\
  \ as the man places his hand on the girl\u2019s inner thigh. Her posture is rigid\
  \ and I watch her body tense as I finally put two and two together. \n\nShe is a\
  \ prostitute. They are not a couple. The man bought time with her and this is part\
  \ of her job. \n\nMy stomach drops. I feel like throwing up the mango sticky rice\
  \ that now feels heavy inside of me. I open my mouth, irrationally thinking that\
  \ I will say something to set this man straight. Instead, I find him staring at\
  \ me. His eyes slide past my face, hovering too long on my chest, moving slowly\
  \ down the rest of my body. He doesn\u2019t say anything, but I can almost hear\
  \ his voice, \u201CHow much for her?\u201D\n \nI grab Titang\u2019s hand, suddenly\
  \ protective of my friend. \u201CWe\u2019re leaving.\u201D I address the man directly\
  \ and the tuk tuk pulls over so we can hop off. \n\t\nWater shoots me in the back.\
  \ It\u2019s cold and forceful and not at all like the splashing from the kids. I\
  \ turn around and see the man aiming a massive water gun at me. \u201CSuper splasher\u201D\
  \ reads across the side of it. Everything about this man is huge, clunky, out of\
  \ place. \n\nThe tuk tuk drives off and disappears out of sight. I can feel Titang\
  \ staring at me, clearly confused, but I don\u2019t have words for her. All I can\
  \ think of is how similar the girl, Titang, and me all look. Young, dark-skinned,\
  \ soft features. The rice in my stomach feels heavier as I think about how many\
  \ big 10 baht coins the man used to buy her. I still don\u2019t have all the right\
  \ words, so I just clutch my friend\u2019s hand tighter than ever. \u201CLet\u2019\
  s go.\u201D"
