Text: "Singapore, A country in size of a city, that many called modern, high-end and\
  \ extraordinary. Many hope to see exquisite buildings, high technology gadgets,\
  \ luxurious lifestyle of the people. But I found something different, hidden in\
  \ busy society, a kindness that some may find rare yet truly beautiful. One act\
  \ of stranger that help to redifined what humanity is. \n\nLast year I went to singapore\
  \ with my friend for the first time. Had travel by myself to several country, as\
  \ usual I were keeping my confidence and positivity. Try to found my own way and\
  \ asked question to stranger for direction. I stumbled upon a couple, while waiting\
  \ for my friend. I talked with them as a friendly gesture. After a while I finished\
  \ my conversation by asking them where can I found a halal restaurant nearby. Yes,\
  \ I am a moslem woman and I can only eat halal food. \n\nWhat happened next was\
  \ the begining of a wonderful journey. They not only told me where to go but they\
  \ also took us there, paid for our food and invited us to their daughter house nearby.\
  \ Very kind indeed what they have done, we talked more , as I were curious about\
  \ why could easily trusted strangers. \n\nWith light expression, the husband answered\
  \ \"this was how I want to present my self in Allah's eyes, this was going to be\
  \ my good deed in Allah's sides\". It suprise me, how a sincere mind can easily\
  \ makes stranger as family out of faith. At that moment not only I see their kindness\
  \ but also God's blessing. It is very true that traveling will allowed u to find\
  \ how kind and  powerful God is. Those couple not stoped there. They continued to\
  \ suprise me, because later that day they tooked us to marina bay sand, to merlion\
  \ and to our guesthouse. \n\nTo be more suprised, we even went to johor, Malaysia,\
  \ full accomodation and food was guaranted by them, they also gave us ride to the\
  \ airport and treat us with another lunch. \n\nFull three days they provide us with\
  \ everything a person need, extra friendly, extra kindness and extra sincere. Singapore\
  \ was wonderful but what I found in Singapore was a lifetime treasure nobody could\
  \ understand or forget. I did not expect to see such kindness and sincerity but\
  \ yet Singapore is a gem indeed."
