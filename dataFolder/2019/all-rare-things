Text: "I was sitting in the airplane, waiting to land into the unknown. It was such\
  \ a rare feeling. I was looking at a photo of the Peru Rainbow Mountains, that one\
  \ photo I found in my grandma\u2019s closet when she passed away 12 years ago and\
  \ since that day I knew I was going to make my way to Peru somehow. I read books,\
  \ travel websites, watched documentaries and I always felt like I knew everything\
  \ about this country. Until that very moment, few minutes before landing, when I\
  \ realised I didn\u2019t know a thing about Peru. \nMy grandma used to tell me about\
  \ a friend of hers. One day, the mailman came and gave my grandma a letter from\
  \ France. It was from Marie Claire. The only problem was my grandmother didn\u2019\
  t know any Marie Clairs\u2019s. Especially from France. She oppened the letter and\
  \ started reading. Marie was a woman her age who just got beaten up by her husband.\
  \ By all the teardrops on the sheet of paper, it was sure that she was so hurt emotionally,\
  \ not only physically.She was very confused and she was asking her friend Ophelia\
  \ for advice. The thing was that Ophelia from Nice never recieved her letter. It\
  \ was Ophelia from Bulgaria who answered Marie\u2019s letter. A few months later\
  \ my grandmother recieved another letter from Marie. She got divorced. Now she felt\
  \ so relieved and thankful to my grandmother. They continued having beautiful conversations\
  \ for years. They became so close, even though they have never met. \nI remember\
  \ the day Marie arrived in my hometown, Varna. My grandma changed her outfits a\
  \ hundred times. I\u2019ve never seen her so nervous. She was so happy to see her\
  \ friend that she had never seen, but also scared if they are going to like eachother.\
  \ Marie was supposed to wear a long red velvet jacket so we can recognise her on\
  \ the airport. My grandma said that she felt Marie coming and Marie claims that\
  \ she recognised my grandma, even though they never met in person, she felt her\
  \ energy. The moment they hugged eachother on Terminal 1 was so magical. She stayed\
  \ for 2 weeks and grandma promised to go visit her. She never had the chance to.\
  \ She passed away too young. But I did. I found Marie in Paris and stayed at her\
  \ house for a few days. She couldn\u2019t stop talking about my grandma. For her\
  \ she was an angel sent by God. She said that after meeting in Bulgaria, they became\
  \ even closer and even though they tought they know everything about eachother,\
  \ there was so much more. \u201CYour grandma was like an art gallery. You can go\
  \ there every day for years to stare at the beautiful art and you\u2019ll never\
  \ get bored\u201D Yes, my grandma was art. And their friendship was one of all the\
  \ rare things that life brings us.\nI was on the airplane, waiting to land into\
  \ the unknown. I wasn\u2019t scared anymore. I knew that no matter how many books\
  \ I\u2019ve read, there\u2019s so much more to learn about this beautiful place,\
  \ the people, the culture. I\u2019ve seen so many pictures, but they can\u2019t\
  \ compare with what I was about to see with my own eyes. I\u2019ve cooked traditional\
  \ dishes of Peru at my apartment in Sofia, but they\u2019ll never taste as good\
  \ as the ones made by the locals. \nI landed. And I couldn\u2019t wait to see my\
  \ dearest friend Peru for the first time."
