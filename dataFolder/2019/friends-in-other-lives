Text: "The train ride was heavy with the scent of instant noodles and unfamiliarity.\
  \ Curious eyes gazed upon my skin, fascinated by the foreign sounds exchanged by\
  \ my two friends and I. \n\nFirst we had left the comfort of Australia to arrive\
  \ into the strange world of China and now we were leaving the comfort of a small\
  \ city in North-Eastern China known as Qingdao, to go to Beijing- an even greater\
  \ unknown. \n\nQingdao was a radiant city enveloped by the ocean and just over four\
  \ hours by bullet train from Beijing. The four hours soon came to an end and upon\
  \ arriving, I began to notice the differences between the little sailing city of\
  \ Qingdao and the great capital of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nAt the\
  \ station, I kept close to my friends as we were propelled into a sea of strangers\
  \ - all speaking tongues I could not begin to deduce. The small city girl in me\
  \ was unacquainted with the fleeting lights and sounds of the the livid train station.\
  \ \n\n\u201CNo one wants the best for us here,\u201D I thought to myself as I surveyed\
  \ the expanse of so called Taxi drivers attempting to charge comical amounts for\
  \ brief rides down the road.  \nWe were alone in a place with locals who could not\
  \ apprehend the world we came from, or so I thought. \n\nWe used the little Mandarin\
  \ we knew to get as close to our accommodation as possible. I realised that the\
  \ streets and Beijing cold did not agree with our depleted bodies. Our three minds\
  \ working together were still no match for the cryptic directions provided by our\
  \ Airbnb host. \n\nAn hour of meandering through damp lanes and glowing convenience\
  \ stores amounted to no luck. By this point in time we were all tired of saying,\
  \ \u201CN\u012D h\u0103o,\u201D and flashing our screens with Baidu (Chinese Google)\
  \ Maps on display, to the locals. \n\nWe were more than ready to give up when a\
  \ girl came sauntering past. In one last effort to find our Airbnb we routinely\
  \ asked for directions. The girl went completely out of her way to assist us and\
  \ the next hour was spent in an attempt to communicate; us through our disjointed\
  \ Mandarin and her through her minimal English.\n\nThrough extreme complications,\
  \ the girl took us under her wing and guided us to the warmth of our apartment.\
  \ All this and we never even got her name.\n\nAlthough language was not on our side-\
  \ after spending an hour with her, I felt like I had made a friend. The realisation\
  \ that this place was her home came shortly after.\n\nThese very streets could have\
  \ been where she had experienced her first kiss or maybe the supermarket across\
  \ the road was where she worked night shift.\n\nMaybe in another life, we could\
  \ have been best friends.  \nNonetheless she was an angel who I had the extraordinary\
  \ privilege of crossing paths with.\n\n\nThe next few days were not perfect, but\
  \ they consisted of intense, genuine encounters with other compelling humans beings.\n\
  \nA Beijing local showed us the wonder of The Great Wall and the Forbidden City.\
  \ Although I was not in my element and drowning neck deep in masses of people, I\
  \ had never felt so in love with the world and connected to history and humanity.\
  \ \n\n\nLater on, the intense parts of my encounters were experienced. A couple\
  \ tried to take us to a tea room purely for the sake of \u201Clearning English\u201D\
  \ (or so they said) and an outraged lady in a bar nearly threw a glass at us. These\
  \ moments were learning curves to say the least. \n\n\nFrom the moment I had arrived\
  \ in Beijing, I had been under the assumption that my stay would teach me distrust\
  \ and how to see the worst in people. Nevertheless I was mostly proven wrong. \n\
  \nThrough good and bad, the incomprehensible connections formed between my friends\
  \ and I and a few tender-hearted locals taught me the value of kindness.\n\nChina\
  \ taught me what kind of love I want to be consistently putting out into the world,\
  \ a skill that no textbook or university could ever teach me."
