Text: "My story began in August 2018, but is, like most stories, still ongoing.  I\
  \ was in the same job for 14 years with very little experience of the world beyond\
  \ my little world.  It terrified me to leave it all and take a job abroad in order\
  \ to travel and see other cultures in real life instead of on a screen in my living\
  \ room.  I could spend a whole page on just the stressful agony of how my VISA was\
  \ rejected 2 weeks before my flight where my new job awaited in Germany.  I could,\
  \ but I will fast forward to the airport where I said goodbye to my family as we\
  \ all worked hard on keeping all our emotions in.  It felt like we all knew we wanted\
  \ to cry, but if one would start, would we all be able to stop?  The moment I turned\
  \ my back and walked through customs, my 37-year-old heart was so confused.  Sadness\
  \ was pulsing through it with some fearfulness, but then there was also a sense\
  \ of freedom somewhere in there.  \n\nMy flight was about 13 hours long and sleep\
  \ was a battle.  The symptoms varied from swollen feet, blocked ears and a hint\
  \ of claustrophobia at some point.  But let me forward to actual Germany.  It is\
  \ the part you'd like to know about, isn't it?  \n\nA remarkable woman from back\
  \ home told me something that is still ringing in my ears as I am typing out these\
  \ words right now.  She said:  \"Nandie, remember, these people might not embrace\
  \ you with open arms.  There's a lot of hurt and pain in their history.\"  It was\
  \ the second day in Germany and I had just settled in to my new flat in Neuss, Germany.\
  \  I was walking down the streets and I really saw what she meant.  No one smiles\
  \ at you, no one greets you.  I made the mistake of thinking \"these people\" are\
  \ so rude.  It didn't take long for me to have to ask someone for help and I am\
  \ incredibly happy to report that I was met with friendliness and helpfulness. \
  \ I am still watching the Germans and their ways in absolute fascination.  I admire\
  \ their traditions and how they will not watch movies that are not dubbed into their\
  \ own language.  I enjoy watching their faces when they are at the parades during\
  \ carnival or listening to the bands marching through the streets during Sch\xFC\
  tzenfestival (certainly my favorite festival of them all).  \n\nAt first, I found\
  \ it very funny how all pedestrians actually wait for the light to turn green before\
  \ crossing the road, but if one thinks about it, where does breaking the rules end?\
  \  I started to fall in line and follow suit.  The rules were annoying at first,\
  \ but it didn't take long for it to make me feel safe in this foreign country far\
  \ from my home.  I remember a kid putting his feet on a chair during a train ride,\
  \ which became my \"people watching\" time.  A much older lady immediately scolded\
  \ him and he quickly took his feet off.  I felt she needed to be rewarded for stepping\
  \ in and protecting public transport.  I am not used to this.\n\nI found myself\
  \ quickly making friends and building a support system with other expats.  Then\
  \ I met a guy and, in our short courtship, I remember he said that I should make\
  \ friends with Germans.  He explained that it doesn't make sense coming to Germany,\
  \ but only have expat friends.  So, that is what I did.  So far, I have two German\
  \ friends.  I have learned so much through them, ranging from German politics, German\
  \ banking, beautiful churches, rebuilding Germany after World War II (and yes, they\
  \ talk about it!) and too much to mention here.  I try to take pictures and post\
  \ them on social media, but the pictures are always so disappointing, it just does\
  \ not capture the sounds and the feeling.  You would have to pause your life as\
  \ you know it, endure the flight and come listen as the Germans walk their cobbled\
  \ streets while bells ring from corner to corner!"
