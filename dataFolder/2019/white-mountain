Text: "\"Henos, chitto chitto henos (Come, come quickly)\"\n\nI exhaled, got out the\
  \ pole and walked ahead gingerly. I could make out Aita Hang standing at the end\
  \ of the bend, leaning against a rock. The wooden bridges at the start of our walk\
  \ had given way to moss-laden trees. The path - a mesh of stones thrown together,\
  \ over which he would jump and glide while I puffed and panted, cursing my decision\
  \ to join the group. What was I thinking attempting the Goe Chala for my first trek?\
  \ \n\nThrough the Kanchenjunga National Park, the trek was a technical one, spanning\
  \ seven days via the Dzongri peak. Only I didn't know it then. I had walked in blindly\
  \ after a short meet with two girls. Five hours in, in the middle of rebuking myself\
  \ again, it started drizzling. Exhausted and vision-blurred, I slipped and dunked\
  \ my feet in a small puddle. The rain was getting harder and there was no way to\
  \ reach the campsite before sundown. Hang found a makeshift hut used by yak herders\
  \ and locals. We slipped into the sleeping bags in the lone room, only to shift\
  \ uneasily as the wind whooshed in through the crevices.\n\nOutside, the rain refused\
  \ to relent. It poured as we adjusted our raincoats to the sway of the wind. We\
  \ could barely see two steps ahead. It didn't get any better the third day as we\
  \ headed towards Dzongri. Such rains during November were unheard of but there we\
  \ were - wet clothes, smelly socks, pruney feet and a traveller's hut with two rooms.\n\
  \nIt was the bagful of wet socks that took us to the kitchen. Perched on the cane\
  \ baskets used by the porters, socks were dried and corn soup poured. With a single\
  \ porter between the three of us, our food had run out. Hang's cousin was hosting\
  \ a party of French, with ample provisions. Our 24-year-old introverted guide ensured\
  \ we were fed well courtesy the French. Having given up a job as a kitchen staff,\
  \ Hang had come back likes many peers to the mountains. \n\nChaanu, our porter,\
  \ in the trade for 20 years now, would skip between Sikkim and Nepal to make ends\
  \ meet. For the past few years, Kashmir instead of Nepal. In that kitchen where\
  \ we find ourselves each day cries of Sewaro (Hello) rang out as Hang's friends\
  \ took us into the fold. Evenings, full of songs, the local beer Chaang, canned\
  \ fruits and pancakes coupled with us pulling their legs or commenting on their\
  \ hip hairstyles.\n\nWhen the sky cleared up on the fourth, I was glad I didn't\
  \ give into the urge to quit at Dzongri. The surroundings were awash with colours\
  \ - yellows, reds, browns and greens, the gurgle of streams and puffs of white clouds.\
  \ The feet, walking of their own accord for once, running into Chaanu with three\
  \ hot mugs of tea! We had reached Thansing, our campsite, in three hours! The mountain\
  \ loomed ahead, a block of white amid barren browns. Shivering despite the layers,\
  \ I couldn't stop looking. In those moments all was forgotten - the malodour of\
  \ the washroom, the straining calves, the rains. I could barely hear Hang calling\
  \ me inside. Who knew a leap into the unknown would yield such riches?"
