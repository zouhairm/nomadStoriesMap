Text: "I love many things about travelling.\nBut what I always love the most is the\
  \ way you look in front of the sceneries that I have never imagined to share with\
  \ you. \nI swear I saw those two eyes sparkle in joy whenever I didn't expect to\
  \ find.  \n\n-------\n\nI love the way you smiled in front of that slightly scarlet\
  \ cloudless sky. That smile became a bookmark on my brain. \n\nWhenever I see any\
  \ slight crimson ink on light violet canvas, now I immediately recall the water\
  \ we cruised; the warm evening breeze we sailed; the one person that I yearned to\
  \ gaze. \n\nDo you remember those lovely pals who waved back at us when we waved\
  \ our caps and hands over our head to them? We were crossing the water, you seemed\
  \ lost in your thought, and I just wanted to get you back to me. So I began to delightfully\
  \ greet the strangers as we cruise by, and you surprisingly joined me. I swear;\
  \ the river was murky with dark green touches, yet I swear I would have jumped into\
  \ it to make you smile wider and deeper.\n\n-------\n\nI love the way you stood\
  \ in front of the tingled red lanterns, waiting patiently for me to find you. \n\
  \nI was lost - the delighted crowd caught my sights; endless rows of street foods\
  \ distracted my smell; delightful footsteps, excited chatters, and faintly playing\
  \ Chinese karaoke from far far away distracted my ears. You know that I was never\
  \ good at staying on track when I am placed on the new place - my heartbeats always\
  \ keep skipping one or two beats away. \n\nThen there was you.  \nThe way you stood\
  \ with your striking blue dress\u2026 \nThe way you look stood out against everyone\
  \ and everything. \n\nWhen everyone was yellow, you were blue. \nWhen the time seemed\
  \ to stop on the \u201980s on that street, you seemed to make that clock tap-dance\
  \ again. \n\n-------\n\nI love travelling.\nYet, what I love the most was the way\
  \ you look."
