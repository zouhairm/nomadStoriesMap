Text: "It was December 29, 2014. A 21 years old girl full of dreams and fears landed\
  \ for her first travel in a foreign country and she was alone. This girl that arrived\
  \ at Mendoza, Argentina, in a very hot afternoon \u2013 typical in the summer of\
  \ South America \u2013 was me. The travel was part of a social exchange. When I\
  \ arrived at the airport with a really big and heavy bag, a boy of the internship\
  \ agency was waiting for me. We should get three buses to Guaymall\xE9n, a district\
  \ of Mendoza, where was localized the NGO that I would work in the next two months.\
  \ The road was long and the weather didn\u2019t help. In a city that never rains,\
  \ in that day rained \u2013 and not a little! We didn\u2019t have any umbrellas,\
  \ so we had to run to a bus from another with the bag. \n\nDespite of that beginning,\
  \ the travel couldn\u2019t be better. I learned that these small daily issues, like\
  \ be soaked after a rain, are nothing close to the problems of other people. During\
  \ the internship, I worked in a NGO, teaching Portuguese and Brazilian culture to\
  \ Argentinean children, showing to them maps, foods, typical music and dances, cartoon\
  \ movies and soccer games of my country. Moreover, I and the other trainees promoted\
  \ creative activities evolving drawing, painting and competition between groups.\
  \ We also talked about good manners and personal hygiene habits, like wash hands\
  \ before eating and brush the teeth. The situation of these kids is horrible: sometimes\
  \ they don`t have water to take a shower neither food enough in their houses. So,\
  \ the NGO provides every afternoon a meal for them. Besides, is very common for\
  \ the children to spend all day in the streets \u2013 frequently without going to\
  \ school \u2013 seeing teenagers using drugs in the corners. \n\nI never felt that\
  \ I was so important for the world, like I felt that time. The amazing reception\
  \ that Argentineans have given to me, developed a personal desire of make that community\
  \ a better place to live. It was like the world was screaming to me: BE HAPPY AND\
  \ MAKE THE OTHER PEOPLE HAPPY TOO. \n\nWhen I arrived in Argentina, it was almost\
  \ new year and for the first time I was away from my family and friends. This celebration\
  \ had everything to be the saddest of my life, because I was in Mendoza for just\
  \ three days and I didn\u2019t know anyone well enough. But I was wrong and that\
  \ New Year was the most special that I\u2019ve ever passed. I was invited to have\
  \ dinner with a family of a girl that worked in the internship agency. We ate in\
  \ a very beautiful table in the garden. The family was really big, so the voices\
  \ and laughs brought something magical to the atmosphere. After the midnight, I\
  \ and the girl of the agency went to a party in the hostel, where other trainees\
  \ of the program were living. I met people from India, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Peru\
  \ and I drank Pisco \u2013 a delicious Peruvian drink. Beyond that, I danced until\
  \ the sunrise.    \n\nDuring these two months, I lived in the NGO accommodation,\
  \ sharing the room with other two Brazilian girls that were working with me. Then,\
  \ I could live together with people of different regions of my country (I\u2019\
  m from the south and they are from the northeast). And I have no doubts that northeast\
  \ people are usually more talkative and funnier than southerners. Thus, I\u2019\
  ve started to be more receptive and less shy. We used to cook together in the nights\
  \ and we spent the days preparing the activities for the kids.  \n\nMendoza is an\
  \ incredible place. There are a lot of squares and the Andes Mountains around the\
  \ city. But the most beautiful thing is the kindness of the citizens. There, I have\
  \ never felt alone. Always has a person to help you (since to give an information\
  \ in the streets until inviting you to spend some days in their own house). The\
  \ biggest mountains in Mendoza aren\u2019t those of the Andes, but are the mountains\
  \ of love and generosity scattered everywhere by your people."
