Text: "I was ending my long vacation from Dubai to srilanka till Maldives. It was\
  \ at 21.00, and at that time there is no private jet to take us from the airport\
  \ of Mali to the island. We didn\u2019t want to sleep , my family and I , in mali\
  \ for safety reason . We were a family group from Lebanon and Germany . We went\
  \ to the Island threw public boat because it was the only available option at night\
  \ . The waves were really heavy and exiting at night , the people were really scary\
  \ , we all felt the insecurity and the fear . They were all the extremist with large\
  \ barbe and very poor people because they were going to the first local island .\
  \ The boat stopped at each island and ours was the last one . Fear from people and\
  \ waves very huge we coudnt sleep for 5-6 hours . Because I\u2019m a girl , I still\
  \ remember that I weared the cap of my brother to not attract attention . People\
  \ were looking at us with attention . We were the only foreign group. At 5 am we\
  \ reached the island. Once arrived we forgot everything . The view with the sunrise\
  \ were like paradise , unforgettable..... we spent the most beautiful days in our\
  \ life there : eating swimming, tanning , eating , drinking, dancing..:: full of\
  \ food and alcohol all the time ..:: we went back with the private jet reaching\
  \ in 30 minutes. The color of the sky and the water are really close, the water\
  \ transparent,you swim with the fishes .::: one of the best destination around the\
  \ world ."
