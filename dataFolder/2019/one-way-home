Text: "As an undergraduate student finishing his studies, I decided to go to Iceland\
  \ with a peer, not knowing what to expect. The plan was to just go for an adventure,\
  \ and live the moment. Little did I know about this unique country, apart from the\
  \ fact it is close to the North Pole and that the temperature would most likely\
  \ be freezing cold. With a secondhand rental car - yes, they have this in Iceland\
  \ - we started our journey to the unknown in the mostly deserted island. My story\
  \ focuses on the last day of my trip, returning back from J\xF6kuls\xE1rl\xF3n to\
  \ Keflav\xEDk airport. Driving in Iceland is a unique experience, as there is only\
  \ one main road that goes around the island, connecting villages separated by vast\
  \ empty lands. We would be driving hours without seeing any trace of human beings,\
  \ only waterfalls, black volcanic sands, rare vegetation and an endless road. One\
  \ thing we did know for sure was that at the end of the road we would reach the\
  \ airport, as there was no way of getting lost. On our way, suddenly, we find a\
  \ British couple, walking on this lonely road with backpacks. We decided to stop\
  \ and give them a lift, as we knew that most likely they would go in our same direction.\
  \ The car, which was normally quiet and relaxing, became full of life with everyone\
  \ sharing their adventure in this island, apparently full of secrets and undiscovered\
  \ places. Luckily enough for the couple, they were hoping for someone to give them\
  \ a lift to the airport, not realising that it would have taken them probably more\
  \ than a day walking to reach their destination. A few kilometres away from the\
  \ airport, we decided to stop in the middle of nowhere, to enjoy one last glimpse\
  \ at the dark sky of night full of shining stars. It had been an amazing trip, too\
  \ much to leave behind like that. It was at that point, my travelling buddy decided\
  \ to remain a few more days in the island, and follow the couples advice to visit\
  \ a few more places that we left behind. Unfortunately I had to go back and I couldn\u2019\
  t miss that flight, but looking back I have no regrets at all. I would go back and\
  \ still remember where to find these places, and maybe discover more on that circular\
  \ road that one way or the other everyone in that island has to take to get home."
