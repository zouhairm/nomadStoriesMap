Text: "\u201CI hate Halloween. So why am I outside in a day like this? No, the question\
  \ is, why am I outside in a day like this in New York?\u201D\n\nThose were the questions\
  \ that haunt my head as I climbed the millions of steps that would allow me to get\
  \ to the correct stop of the train. Ok, there weren\u2019t millions of steps, but\
  \ it felt as if it had been. With the breeze of the upcoming winter crashing against\
  \ me, the trash that came and went with it, the rats that could appear when they\
  \ wanted and the infernal inclination of the stairs, anyone would have thought it.\
  \ \n\nThe only thing giving me strength was the sweater I was wearing. I know, it\
  \ sounds weird, but let me explain. My friends and I love the movie \"The Sisterhood\
  \ of the Traveling Pants\" so we decided that this year in honor of the film, our\
  \ friendship and the distance we would have, we would share a sweater that fits\
  \ us all. \n\nThe idea of having the sweater comforted me when I was most afraid,\
  \ and that means all the time because I'm a coward. It comforted me when I hadn't\
  \ left the airport and was already lost in so much gray. When minutes later I took\
  \ an Uber and my internet didn't work so I didn't know where I was going, only that\
  \ the city, like the sun in a sunset, was appearing in front of me. \n\nIt comforted\
  \ me when I took the train alone the first time and the second and the ones after\
  \ that. Really, I hated taking the train. I don't know if it was because sometimes\
  \ I felt like people were judging me, my curly hair, my color, the clothes I had,\
  \ or if like the coward I am, everything was in my head. But that didn't stop me\
  \ from taking the train every day and getting to know the city.\n\nWhen my aunt\
  \ didn't change the news channel for a complete day and I found out about the daily\
  \ death of other Latinos in the same country I was in, the sweater comforted me\
  \ then, and I was able to go out with a peaceful mind, and walk alone, and look\
  \ up every day while I was doing it, because all the buildings looking me down made\
  \ me feel human again. It comforted me so much, that I decided it was okay to meet\
  \ a stranger and have a date. Mom, if you read this, I'm sorry, but everything went\
  \ well, so you can't scold me. \n\nThe sweater comforted me in such a way it allowed\
  \ me to meet new people, go out with old friends, go to a concert and be happy,\
  \ the kind of happiness in which you think you are outside your body because there\
  \ is no way in which that time can be repeated. It gave me the power to do everything\
  \ I ever wanted to do by myself in an unknown, big and beautiful city.\n\nAnd now\
  \ is comforting me while I am crossing one of the busiest avenues while a man in\
  \ wheelchairs carries on his legs a speaker with a song that gives me chills. Did\
  \ I already say it was Halloween? And that I'm a coward? So what was I doing? I\
  \ was living, and I know I wasn't doing it for the sweater, although it served as\
  \ a pretext to say that yes, I was doing it for me. \n\nIn NY I didn't find a great\
  \ adventure that could be remembered for generations or met someone in particular\
  \ or I did something incredible. But I found myself behind the fear that consumed\
  \ my life and that is the best gift of all."
