Text: "\u201CAre you sure this is your seat?\u201D \n\nI glanced up at the couple\
  \ towering above me. Both had on matching monochromatic ensembles. \n\n\u201CPretty\
  \ sure it is,\u201D I replied as I rummaged through my handbag to retrieve the e-ticket\
  \ on my handphone. \n\nI was onboard the train from Paris to Amsterdam. Married\
  \ but separating and not wanting to spend another birthday alone, I had made my\
  \ flight bookings for a return flight from Singapore to Paris. I knew I wanted to\
  \ fly in and out of Paris but I had no idea of the details. Amsterdam was another\
  \ spur-of-the-moment decision. \n\nAs I verified the details of the booking that\
  \ I had so hastily made the night before, I realised that the seat was indeed mine.\
  \ Unfortunately, I had booked for the 21st of December instead of 21st of November.\
  \ I silently berated myself \u2013 it was the second time I had made such an error;\
  \ the evening before, I had booked the hostel for the wrong day. I mumbled an apology\
  \ as I shuffled myself and my belongings to the empty seats at the front of the\
  \ cabin. I could almost feel the eyes of the other passengers piercing my back.\
  \ Among the people onboard the train, my caramel skin was conspicuous . I shrunk\
  \ into the chair, willing my petite Asian body to disappear. \n\nSoon enough, a\
  \ ticketing officer appeared and I was grateful that I had enough cash on me to\
  \ pay full fare. He assured me that there would be a refund on the other ticket.\
  \ That never happened (but that is a story for another day).\n\nJust as I started\
  \ to shrug off the events of the day, a group of people emerged in the cabin. A\
  \ tall man, possibly of mixed ethnicity, stopped in front of me and asked to check\
  \ my ticket and passport. \n\nHe had a tattooed sleeve. Such people had a reputation\
  \ where I am from. \n\nI hesitated but he spoke with such authority that I handed\
  \ them over. He asked if I was carrying 10000 of any currency and I replied in the\
  \ negative. Yet, he rifled through my wallet.\n\nI was humiliated. \u201CWhy wouldn\u2019\
  t he take my word for it?\u201D \n\nExplaining that it was a random spot-check,\
  \ he apologised for the intrusion and left. But as I turned to look, he and his\
  \ entourage zoomed past the other passengers. \n\nI had been wearing my prettiest\
  \ dress \u2013 it was crimson-red \u2013 and heels. It was my birthday after all.\
  \ I thought I looked expensive enough; they thought I looked Siberian enough. \n\
  \nOnce in Amsterdam, the tourist centre helped me to book my tours. By that point,\
  \ they could have told me any figure and I would have gladly thrown the money at\
  \ them. It had only been a three-hour ride but I was fatigued. \n\nThree days in\
  \ Amsterdam were thankfully uneventful. I would hang out past midnight and despite\
  \ its reputation, courtesy of the sex and the drugs, I felt relatively safe. People\
  \ still stared at me but stoned people are not violent people. \n\nEventually, when\
  \ I took the train to Belgium, I was cautiously optimistic. \nUp until I reached\
  \ the station. A number of people had darker skin. I had read so much on online\
  \ travel forums that I was a little wary although I had no logical reason to be.\n\
  \nI tried navigating the cobbled streets but I kept getting lost on my way to the\
  \ hostel and wound up at the station again. I approached one of the men milling\
  \ around. He flashed me a grin and pointed me in the right direction.\n\nAs I thanked\
  \ him, a Siberian lady approached me.\n\n\u201CWhat would you do with the money?\u201D\
  \n\nShe pointed to the roadside kiosk nearby. \n\n\u201CLet\u2019s go get you pastries\
  \ and coffee then.\u201D\n\nAs I paid for the items, this time too I felt the gaze\
  \ of the fair-skinned people. But I no longer cared. \n\nWhen I booked my trip,\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to find racism. I had travelled 10000 km and experienced\
  \ racism first-hand yet I had been frightened simply because they were not familiar\
  \ to me. \n\n\u201CThe soul becomes dyed with the colour of its thoughts\u201D Marcus\
  \ Aurelius"
