Text: "The hills beyond are like a field covered with a thick blanket of trees. The\
  \ slope nearby is pale green. It\u2019s May and trees are only yawning after the\
  \ winter asking: \u2018Is it the true spring\u2019s coming?\u2019 Far away, the\
  \ mountains have a cold-sea color.\nI\u2019m curled up in the middlest middle of\
  \ the mountain\u2019s top. Unlike these silly boys, I don\u2019t want to fall down\
  \ into this beauty.\n\u2018Ann, come here!\u2019 Miron called. \u2018Not so high\
  \ to be scared! Only\u2014\u2019\n\u2018Only enough to break your neck!\u2019 I\
  \ interrupted. \u2018The view is much better from here!\u2019\nMiron laughed and\
  \ continued jumping with other boys.\n\u2018When are we going down?\u2019 I asked\
  \ our guide. He was a shabby gloomy ranger smelling of tree bark.\n\u2018When somebody\
  \ adorns the scenery with his bloody body and we have to remove it.\u2019\nHe took\
  \ out a cigarette.\n\u2018What a grim person you are!\u2019 I wondered.\n\u2018\
  On Yamantau mountain I am.\u2019\nHe blew smoke into the gray sky.\n\u2018Why?\u2019\
  \n\u2018Do you know what the name \u201CYamantau\u201D means?\u2019\n\u2018A-Mountain-With-A-Long-Way-To-The-Top?\u2019\
  \ I supposed.\n\u2018No. It means \u201CThe Wicked Mountain\u201D.\u2019\nStrange,\
  \ I thought. Why didn\u2019t we go to another mountain?\n\u2018Not my problem. That\u2019\
  s your teacher\u2019s idea!\u2019\nMy teacher\u2019s\u2026 He is far back now! With\
  \ other tired adults.\n\u2018What time does the train to Ufa leave?\u2019 the ranger\
  \ asked.\n\u2018In two hours, I guess.\u2019\n\u2018We have to run,\u2019 the ranger\
  \ said very calmly.\nWe gathered the boys bit by bit, like it always goes with boys,\
  \ and rushed down the mountain.\nFor about a mile down we ran into adults. \nThe\
  \ parents wanted to climb to the top with the ranger: why had the children been\
  \ so high and the adults were left behind? But we had no time.\nOur teacher was\
  \ the most aggrieved. Adults quarreled, but, actually, I didn\u2019t care: Miron\
  \ was telling me lovely stories about mama bear and bear cubs on Yamantau.\nWe got\
  \ going again. Fifteen minutes later everybody stopped.\n\u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019\
  \ I asked somebody\u2019s mother.\n\u2018We can\u2019t see the road!\u2019 she was\
  \ really pale.\n\u2018Oh, come on!\u2019\n\u2018We can\u2019t come on! We are lost!\u2019\
  \n\u2018How is it possible with the ranger?\u2019\n\u2018The ranger,\u2019 the mother\
  \ grinned, \u2018is on the top! With your teacher, who wanted to see the view!\u2019\
  \nI was startled. The stories about bears didn\u2019t seem so cute and fluffy now.\
  \ I remembered the name of the mountain\u2026\n\u2018Lost! Wow!\u2019 Miron cheered.\
  \ \u2018Hope we won\u2019t find the way out and sleep on the mountain!\u2019\nThe\
  \ boys yelled \u2018hooray\u2019 and rushed away to find sticks for a tent.\nI had\
  \ an idea.\nI caught somebody\u2019s father that was the main in our company.\n\u2018\
  Let\u2019s go back!\u2019 I suggested. \u2018We know for sure where the top is:\
  \ the slope is really steep, so it\u2019s that way. There we\u2019ll meet the ranger\
  \ and go down!\n\u2018What will we do on the top!\u2019 he waved me away. \u2018\
  Let\u2019s shout instead!\u2019\nEverybody yelled. I went ten meters away. Nothing\
  \ could I hear.\nWe whooped until everybody was exhausted.\nI tried to persuade\
  \ adults to go up, but the answer was the same: what\u2019s the point?\nI gave up\
  \ and decided to help the boys.\nThe parents chose to go \u2013 down! Deeper in\
  \ the forest we went until we couldn\u2019t get further.\nOur train \u2013 the last\
  \ train \u2013 was leaving in forty minutes.\n\u2018I\u2019ve got an idea!\u2019\
  \ that main father shouted. \u2018Let\u2019s go back to the top!\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019\
  re the genius!\u2019 the moms gasped.\nWhat? That\u2019s me! I\u2019m the genius!\n\
  In ten minutes we found the road.\nThe boys were dejected. I consoled them saying\
  \ that we might not catch the train.\nWe ran\u2026 In ten minutes we met the ranger\
  \ and the teacher. The teacher was happy he wouldn\u2019t be alone to miss the train.\n\
  We ran up the platform. The train was moving by.\nAnd \u2013 stopped!\n\n\u2018\
  Why did we go to the Wicked Mountain?\u2019 I asked the teacher. Yamantau was getting\
  \ smaller and smaller in the window.\n\u2018Wicked Mountain means Wonderful Adventure.\u2019\
  \nI grinned.\n\u2018Adventures for us and not for you, as usual. Thanks, Gandalf.\u2019"
