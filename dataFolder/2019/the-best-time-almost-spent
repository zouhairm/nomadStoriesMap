Text: "On a cold, white winter morning I got myself up and ready to head to a place\
  \ that unfolded the exact opposite. The taxi ride there was where I vividly saw\
  \ images of myself, being back in place I call \u201Chome\u201D, for the first time\
  \ in three years. But specifically around this time of year, this place of culture\
  \ lights up in beautiful colors full of glory, complimented by the sunshine\u2019\
  s and mild sun showers. Almost like a beautiful flower.\n\nThe flight itself, wasn\u2019\
  t too bad. I\u2019ve probably experienced worse but reaching safely was the only\
  \ thing that mattered at this point. As I stepped off the aircraft, into the gates\
  \ of what I would consider  heaven on earth, I immediately smelled the strong scent\
  \ of one of the most infamous fast food restaurants here: KFC. As tempted as I was\
  \ this was my first time back, as a vegan, so I continued to birth better thoughts\
  \ besides that option like roti, doubles, callaloo, pholourie, and plenty more.\n\
  \nEntering the home of the steel plan, I could already hear the sweet melodies of\
  \ soca and calypso; music and sounds that represents our heritage. Going through\
  \ customs didn\u2019t take as long as I expected. Before I knew it, I was in my\
  \ taxi, heading to my family\u2019s house in Tuna Puna. As we drove through the\
  \ island filled with so much freedom of love, life, and culture, I drifted off into\
  \ a daydream:\n\nSitting on a towel, with the wording representing back home \u201C\
  Brooklyn Nets\u201D, I smile. Seeing all the kids filled with laughter with not\
  \ a worry on the mind, all I can hear from the sounds of it was \u201Cbeach and\
  \ a good time.\u201D Seizing a moment being spent on my favorite beach, Maracas\
  \ Bay, I hear the voice of my people conversing as they wait for the infamous bake\
  \ and shark; they say Maracas is the best place to buy it from. I actually couldn\u2019\
  t agree more, from the days I\u2019ve had it before. With the waves crashing on\
  \ the shore, I get up and began to head towards the clear, blue waters. As I dig\
  \ my feet into the sand, deeper and deeper, I ground myself as a plant in a tropical\
  \ place under the sun, flourishing.\nAs soon as I begin to break free and dive in,\
  \ the taxi driver awakens me and say in a very strong accent \u201CAye, we\u2019\
  ve reached.\u201D\n\nI get out the car and lug my worry-less troubles along side.\
  \ As I began to knock on the door, my Aunt beats me to it by opening the door, excitedly\
  \ saying \u201CWelcome back to Trinidad, Yankee girl.\u201D I couldn\u2019t be more\
  \ happier to be here. Let the Carnival and it\u2019s festivities begin."
