Text: "(Photo of Jesus at the top of a Mayan Temple)\n\nThis is Jesus, a mystic man\
  \ I met at The Copan Archaeological Park. On top of this temple, from which I took\
  \ this picture, the strings of words coming out his mouth were some sort of a magic\
  \ spell. His words began to draw the missing pieces of this gigantic puzzle called\
  \ The Copan Dynasty. I was no longer part of this present world, but a dweller in\
  \ the Classic period, somewhere in the 6th century AD; I was one of those women\
  \ with no pubic hair being part of an exuberant culture. A strident flock of macaws\
  \ flying above us brushed away the colors of the ancient city, and started painting\
  \ again the colors of my present world. \n\nWe descended the temple as returning\
  \ to a mundane world. A group of tour guides were waiting for us, there was a bad\
  \ omen in their eyes when they called Jesus apart. After a moment, Jesus had come\
  \ back to me and said with tearful eyes \u201CMy father just died.\u201D A heart\
  \ attack had taken his dad\u2019s life unexpectedly. I was petrified, like another\
  \ stone in this park, and before I could say anything, he added \u201CThere\u2019\
  s nothing we can do, what needed to be done was done while he was alive, life moves\
  \ on, so let\u2019s keep moving.\u201D \n\nWe kept on walking through those ancient\
  \ paths that once were trodden upon by many Mayans, his ancestors, his dad, and\
  \ now us. He deciphered the hidden messages in the intricate hieroglyphics magnificently\
  \ carved in the stelae and temples, and talked about life and death in a metaphysical\
  \ way, as though he was trying to trick the death by recreating the past so vividly.\
  \ He was not only talking about the Mayans one day inhabited this land, this was\
  \ a cathartic moment for him. His dad as well as this ancient civilization was no\
  \ longer there, but there\u2019s something that somehow still remains from them.\
  \ \n\n\tIn the afternoon, as I explored the ruins of a Mayan cemetery by myself,\
  \ I couldn't stop thinking how fragile a life is and what stays from us after we\
  \ depart from this world. I remembered Lalo, mi abuelito, and how difficult it was\
  \ for me to grasp the idea that he was no longer part of this physical world. Our\
  \ human existence is extremely short, but at the same time our human capacity to\
  \ remember events and pass their cultural value on to future generations make us\
  \ immortal. This is how we humans outsmart the death; a glimpse of enlightenment\
  \ in Jesus' eyes had taught me that. From ancient civilizations to the life of a\
  \ loved one, our nature allows us to keep them alive as long as we keep remembering\
  \ and celebrating their existence. \n\nMaria Angelica Lasso\nCopan Ruinas, Honduras\n\
