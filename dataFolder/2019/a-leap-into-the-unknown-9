Text: "\u201CA Leap Into The Unknown\u201D\n\nWaking up with a mind full of wanderlust,\
  \ heart throbbing from the thought of driving a road that leads to the unknown.\n\
  \ A new world, where nothing is certain. \n\nI see people passing by, each living\
  \ in their own world, and sonder comes upon me when I look into their eyes, wondering\
  \ what their story is. \n\nHere\u2019s my story.\n\nI\u2019m a lost soul trying\
  \ to find its way, not knowing where my feet are taking me. I walk roads that lead\
  \ to mysteries; roads with heavenly trees lining the sides, overshadowing the future.\
  \ After daydreaming about exploring the universe everyday, here I am, in the blazing\
  \ city.\n\nThe City Of Angels, where young boys stand on the sides of the roads\
  \ playing their guitars and singing, hoping that one day they won\u2019t have to\
  \ introduce themselves anymore. I see teenagers walking aimlessly under the city\
  \ lights, some with heartbroken-looking eyes, some with gleaming eyes, and some\
  \ with pure curiosity; wondering what this tremendous city has to offer them. I\
  \ can smell the aroma of street food cooking in the small shops under the tall buildings,\
  \ and an instant feeling of nostalgia hits me. This is what my dreams are made of.\
  \ They\u2019re made of streetlights and strangers smoking behind dark alleys, of\
  \ young people following their dreams of being stars one day, and of street food\
  \ fragrances filling the air.\n\nThe city chaos is clouding my mind, making me want\
  \ to look down on it from the edge of the roof on one of those gargantuan buildings.\
  \ Most people come to this city to take part in the quite literally star studded\
  \ night life of L.A, that never was it for me though; always seeking a glimpse of\
  \ L.A from its mountains, or listening to the city sway under its sparkling lights\
  \ from the beach with the ocean by my side.\n\nThat\u2019s how it\u2019s always\
  \ been; never wanting to be among the chaos, but craving to watch it from afar and\
  \ let it captivate me.\n\nI wander the city like I have never been on earth before,\
  \ mesmerized by everything I see;  from the mountains surrounding the area, to the\
  \ stars twinkling in the sky above me, and the lively city vibe filling my heart\
  \ with ecstasy. \n\nIs this what dreams look like?  Or is this the real life that\
  \ everyone is blinded by? Too blinded to notice the magic you see everyday in all\
  \ the little things.\n \n A gust of wind brushes against my cheek like a ghostly\
  \ kiss, and I knew the ocean was near.\n\n I\u2019m getting closer.\n\nAs I reach\
  \ the ocean, an instant wave of chilly air hits my skin, bringing back my senses.\
  \ A flow of water came crashing on the seashore, and I could feel myself moving\
  \ forward, wanting to be touched by the sea; Malibu Beach.\n\nThis is it, a moment\
  \ I've been dreaming of since what felt like forever. It's incredible how something\
  \ so basic and earthly could make you believe that fairytales exist, and that the\
  \ world holds more magic than you could ever imagine, all you have to do is open\
  \ your eyes, and let your mind be enwreathed with beauty. \n\nI dipped my feet in\
  \ the water and felt tingles on my skin from the coldness, yet softness of it. I\
  \ looked around and saw the city view in front of me, a little far, yet close enough\
  \ to observe it. I can hear the murmurs of people talking; friends chatting about\
  \ their current life events, families having some quality time together, and some\
  \ are just walking with their headphones in, listening to music, and for a moment,\
  \ I felt alive. \n\nIn this cold summer night, I want to let go of everything and\
  \ simply breathe in the moment, let it engulf me, and make me whole. \n\nMy hiraeth\
  \ is slowly slipping away, yet, not quite, as I still have the rest of the universe\
  \ to explore and find my place in the world.\n\nBut until now, this is my home;\n\
  \nThe striking hills of Hollywood, the land of a billion lights, the streets made\
  \ of desire, and the boulevard of hope and dreams."
