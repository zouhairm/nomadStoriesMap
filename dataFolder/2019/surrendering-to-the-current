Text: "\u201CYou\u2019ll find him,\u201D my mom said to me as we waited for the train\
  \ that would return me from a visit to my hometown in Michigan back to my adopted\
  \ city of Chicago. \u201CYou\u2019ll find him and it\u2019ll be easy. He\u2019ll\
  \ love to travel, too.\u201D\n\nHer words weren\u2019t tinged with the pity often\
  \ reserved for single women my age. Still, I didn\u2019t believe her. And it didn\u2019\
  t matter, really \u2013 I was truly happy being single, with loyal friends, an ideal\
  \ home, and a fulfilling career. Working in marketing at a bank afforded me security,\
  \ independence, and the ability to dote on my true love \u2013 travel \u2013 at\
  \ least for my allotted number of vacation days.\n\nUntil it didn\u2019t.\n\nFast\
  \ forward a few weeks. Just one more minute and then your whole life is changing,\
  \ Rachel, I thought to myself as the pixels at the top of my iPhone screen changed\
  \ from 8:58 to 8:59. The fluorescent lights overhead flickered as if to pull me\
  \ out of my thoughts and into the present.\n\nStepping into a conference room straight\
  \ out of central casting, I would be told that after careful review, my position\
  \ had been eliminated. A manila envelope would be slid across the table, an 800\
  \ number would be noted for any questions I may have. And just like that, a decade\
  \ of professional accomplishments was smeared away like chalk by an eraser.\n\n\
  It hurt, even though I had never aspired to spend my weekdays on the 21st floor\
  \ of a drab corporate building. But here\u2019s the thing: Once you find out you\u2019\
  re good at something, and you get rewarded for it, it\u2019s pretty easy to let\
  \ the current carry you from one year to the next.\n\nBut on that day, my last day,\
  \ as my (now former) manager read from her HR-approved script, it was a surprise\
  \ to feel pure relief washing over me \u2013 recognizable, but unfamiliar in this\
  \ context, like being a child and running into your schoolteacher at the grocery\
  \ store.\n\nAt first, I resisted the feeling, then surrendered. The relief was a\
  \ blessed undertow, and fighting it wouldn't do me any good. Floating into this\
  \ new current, it wasn\u2019t hard to change my destination from top of the corporate\
  \ ladder to, well, anywhere.\n\nAnywhere started with Reykjavik, mostly because\
  \ the round-trip tickets were astoundingly cheap. As my departure date approached,\
  \ I filled my month away with more destinations. Edinburgh. Berlin. Copenhagen.\
  \ Oslo. Stockholm. Southern Spain.\n\nIt was on the group tour of Scandinavia where\
  \ the tide truly turned. His name was Dan, but he was called Billo \u2013 after\
  \ all, every born and bred Aussie has a nickname. We rode every roller-coaster at\
  \ Tivoli in Copenhagen, Dan\u2019s beloved Boston Red Sox hat flying off his head\
  \ as we whipped around a turn. We left the Carlsberg brewery tour at the first exit\
  \ we found, instead plopping down in the grass of a nearby park and soaking in the\
  \ afternoon sun (and, secretly, each other). We laughed so much that a bartender\
  \ called us \u201Cthe happy people\u201D \u2013 a real feat when you\u2019re in\
  \ one of the happiest countries on earth.\n\nI had never changed my plans for a\
  \ guy before. But at the end of our tour, sitting in the Stockholm airport with\
  \ the anchor of my career no longer holding me back, I couldn\u2019t think of a\
  \ reason why I shouldn\u2019t book a flight to meet up with Dan in his next destination:\
  \ England. So I did.\n\nStepping into the arrivals terminal in Manchester was not\
  \ unlike being at the highest peak of that Danish roller-coaster. Stomach in my\
  \ throat, not quite able to catch my breath. What awaited me at the bottom of that\
  \ hill wasn\u2019t visible at first, just as Dan\u2019s face was hard to find through\
  \ the throngs of people awaiting their loved ones at baggage claim.\n\nThe feeling\
  \ returned just a few days later when Dan told me he loved me. Crazy, I know. What\u2019\
  s crazier? Today, we live in a small apartment in his hometown of Brisbane, scrimping\
  \ and saving as much as we can for an upcoming year-long trip around the world.\n\
  \nMom is always right, as the saying goes."
