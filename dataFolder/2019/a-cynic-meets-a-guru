Text: "The last city that could possibly come to your mind if you think of nightlife\
  \ would have to be Mysuru. Often referred to as a 'sleepy city', the entire city\
  \ closes down by 10 p.m. And yet, at 11 p.m. on a chilly February evening, just\
  \ as the last of the lights were switched off in Maharaja Palace, the migratory\
  \ birds in Karanji lake slept peacefully, six hundred people were gathered in a\
  \ narrow lane in the city watching the vehicles that were driving by; enthusiasm\
  \ increasing with every passing one. Just a little close to midnight a convoy of\
  \ police buses, Pinnacle Finetza caravans and Mercedes cars drove in, armed Z security\
  \ running swiftly beside the convoy. A small woman in her sixties clad in a white\
  \ sari got out of her car and folded her hands respectfully towards the crowd. Five\
  \ hundred and ninety nine of them went berserk with joy and chanted \u201CAmma ki\
  \ Jai!\u201D (Victory to the mother) \nCompletely unaffected by the euphoric mood,\
  \ I stared at my grandmother, the woman who had brought me to this chaotic mess.\
  \ I clutched her hand as I made my way out of the crowd, wincing in pain as a burly\
  \ man stepped on my foot. \nMata Amritanandamayee or \u2018Amma\u2019 (mother) is\
  \ a spiritual guru whom my grandmother revered and hence, we had embarked on an\
  \ eleven hour train ride to Mysuru to attend her spiritual discourse. \n\u201CI\
  \ am not coming tomorrow. No. There is nothing you could say that would convince\
  \ me!\u201D I declared as I plopped on the cozy hotel bed. \nI was dozing off next\
  \ to a pillar in the Auditorium the next morning even as my grandmother and thousands\
  \ of devotees sat enraptured by Amma\u2019s singing. Restless, I got up and wandered\
  \ around the Ashram. People from all over the world were moving about doing tasks\
  \ I would have otherwise labelled \u2018Indian\u2019. There were Indian and Japanese\
  \ women making colourful Rangolis on the ground, a couple of Americans rolling out\
  \ the dough for Rotis and some elderly Sudanese women tying together strings of\
  \ Jasmine, roses and \u2018golden shower\u2019, the earliest signs of spring. \n\
  I observed a young woman carefully handpicking and cleaning the carpet Amma had\
  \ walked on. She smiled as I sat next to her. \n\u201COm Nama Shivaya.\u201D she\
  \ greeted.\nCuriously I asked, \u201CWhy do you do this? I get Indians falling for\
  \ this. After all, we\u2019re a nation full of godmen and religious fanatics. But\
  \ why would you travel all the way from your country just for a guru?\u201D\n\u201C\
  It actually has nothing to do with religion or Indians. I chose to be with her because\
  \ she is kind and compassionate. I am from Finland and in the two years that I have\
  \ been with Amma, I have served over a thousand people in need.\u201D she said with\
  \ a feeling of satisfaction. \nI sat in silence for a minute before I joined her\
  \ in cleaning the carpet.\nAt ten that evening I stood with my grandmother in a\
  \ queue waiting to get a one-on-one with Amma and seek her blessings. I watched\
  \ Ashram volunteers going around with wet tissues wiping beads of sweat off the\
  \ devotees\u2019 faces as we got closer to Amma.\n\u201CShe embraces everyone and\
  \ whispers words of magic!\u201D my grandmother marveled. The cynic in me smirked.\
  \ \nAt about a foot\u2019s distance, we were asked for our natal language just as\
  \ I started smelling a pleasant fragrance. I finally came face to face with Amma,\
  \ the satirist meets the spiritual leader. \nI was engulfed by heady notes of Sandalwood\
  \ when she embraced me and gently whispered \u201CDarling daughter, wonderful daughter,\
  \ you are Amma\u2019s daughter.\u201D in Tamil. My eyes softened even as I was pushed\
  \ away by the volunteers to make room for the next devotee in line.\nAmma left with\
  \ her convoy the next morning, devotees running beside her car chanting \u201CAmma\
  \ ki Jai!\u201D I stood breathing the jasmine filled air one last time and thought,\
  \ \u201CGod person or not, she sure is divine.\u201D"
