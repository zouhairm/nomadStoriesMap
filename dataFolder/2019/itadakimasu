Text: "Alone with my girlfriend in a tiny bar in the dead of winter, I had seldom\
  \ before felt so warmed and welcome. Our faces flushed from the mostly-empty jug\
  \ of sangria before us, laughter filled the neon-coloured room until there seemed\
  \ no room for anyone who might come after us. With the remains of corn-chips and\
  \ tortillas in front of us, you would be forgiven for assuming we were somewhere\
  \ in Latin America. Outside, though, you would have found only the cold fog and\
  \ narrow side streets of Kyoto, Japan.\nTwo days prior, on our first night in Kyoto,\
  \ we wandered the streets searching for our dinner, having arrived at our first\
  \ choice only to find a \u201Cclosed for business\u201D sign hanging from the door.\
  \ Frustrated and indecisive, I heard an unexpected laugh come from my side. I looked\
  \ up and my girlfriend pointed to Maximo - a tiny Mexican place that would soon\
  \ become one of our fondest memories of Japan. At the time, however, we pondered\
  \ its existence with amusement,\n\u201CWhat do you think Mexican food is like in\
  \ Japan?\u201D\nIt was an intriguing thought - we had first met on exchange in China,\
  \ so neither of us were strangers to peculiar interpretations of Western food. Ultimately,\
  \ though, we decided it would be a waste to visit Japan and not make the most of\
  \ the local food, and left with Maximo in the back of our minds. And he stayed there\
  \ - until the next night, when, over a plate of dumplings, I looked up at my girlfriend\
  \ to find her eyebrows knotted as she looked intently down at her gyoza. I asked\
  \ - don\u2019t you like them?\n\u201CI do! It\u2019s just\u2026\u201D She looked\
  \ sheepish, \u201CIt\u2019s dumb, but I have to know. I need to know what Mexican\
  \ food is like in Japan.\u201D\nAnd so it was settled - the following evening we\
  \ again sought out the almost-intimidatingly bright exterior of Maximo, which we\
  \ soon discovered reflected its inside perfectly. We could see barely seven seats\
  \ in total, and as we took our own we grinned in anticipation. Leaning on our past\
  \ forays into western food in China, we knew that the quality of our food wasn\u2019\
  t going to be the main draw to this experience - that would come from the stories\
  \ we would tell later, laughing to our friends about the time we went all the way\
  \ to Japan for Mexican food. And we were right, in a way.\nExpecting the worst and\
  \ so starting with the simplest - the hardest to get wrong - we began the night\
  \ with a plate of nachos and soft pork tacos, and were immediately enchanted. Who\
  \ we thought was our bartender pulled an assortment of tiny plastic containers from\
  \ every crevice we could see, and many we couldn\u2019t. No kitchen in sight, a\
  \ small, gas-powered camping stove was set up behind the bar itself, and we marvelled\
  \ as he swiftly got to work on our meal. The smell of melting cheese and cumin filled\
  \ the room as queso was prepared and meat spat in the frying pan barely a metre\
  \ away. The moment our now-chef revealed two small, round, perfectly smooth balls\
  \ of dough and something that looked like a metal ping-pong paddle, we knew that\
  \ this night was swiftly headed in a direction that neither of us had ever imagined.\n\
  We returned to see Maximo twice more over our four nights in Kyoto - not always\
  \ without having eaten dinner elsewhere already. We know what others might say -\
  \ what we might have said ourselves before - that it was a waste to spend so much\
  \ time eating food foreign to the country we were travelling in. We could justify\
  \ it by saying that seeing how other countries recreate one another\u2019s culture\
  \ is a valuable cultural experience in itself, and we wouldn\u2019t be wrong by\
  \ any means. At the end of the day, though, the simple fact is that it\u2019s hard\
  \ to feel as though any experience is a waste when you\u2019re standing by the side\
  \ of a river in the dark, warmed by good food and drink, smiling and kissing the\
  \ love of your life as you make your way home after another successful evening at\
  \ Maximo."
