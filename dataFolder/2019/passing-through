Text: "With discerning eyes, she scanned my presence with curiosity as if she were\
  \ invoking the past years of my ancestry. I was passing through a bouquet of market\
  \ stalls that sat on the mountain surrounded by thousands of sunflowers in bloom.\
  \ It was a panoramic view of rolling hills meeting rainbow clouds. You could see\
  \ rows of vegetation for miles, climbing through the neighbouring highlands. Clouds\
  \ formed and disappeared abruptly as they came, giving warning of rain on its way.\
  \ It was only natural to admire the borough of homes that cut into the mountain,\
  \ brightly lit and decorative.\nLike so many market places of Northern Thailand,\
  \ this one peak of achievement stood out over and beyond the others I\u2019ve ascended.\
  \ Soon my realisation flooded with disappointment as the small village filled with\
  \ tourists. A reminder no matter how far from broken tarmac and concrete jungles,\
  \ there will be the odd vacationist, some with big bargaining chips.\nI almost forgot\
  \ the hustle of the busy streets the day before. There are smells that you won\u2019\
  t forget quickly, like the humid fumes of the tuk tuk, fresh market food blended\
  \ with underground septic rivers. Sounds of marketeers & day-trippers bartering,\
  \ music blaring from the bars and local workers enticing you to go inside for a\
  \ cold Bintang.\nMiles further north the air is dense but clean, revitalising my\
  \ lungs after the long day\u2019s journey. I gathered myself, look up & find the\
  \ strength to carry on.\nThe villages sloping through the mountain seemed like they\u2019\
  re pointing towards a final destination. As we travelled higher a transformation\
  \ becomes clear to me. A mix of old traditional homes versus the new age of providence\
  \ thanks to tourism: Homage to the gods for bringing abundance? Or homage to the\
  \ foreign hands that bring finance?\nAfter a few minutes of admiring the multi-coloured\
  \ marquee, full of intricate drapery, I chose a locally made garment suited for\
  \ a cooler and less humid climate. I handed the baht over to the stall owner and\
  \ she carefully placed my item into a bag. I felt my purchase was acknowledged but\
  \ my greatest surprise could have un-stitched the canvas of the tent holding it\
  \ together; A priceless transaction.\nYou can buy a ticket to the majestic places\
  \ in the world but to explore the fullness of its story you need admission by way\
  \ of its people. For it is told through their eyes, their traditions and their stories.\n\
  So here I was, transfigured in a place forgotten in time to be reborn. A humbling\
  \ journey to finally stand before a great mountain that gives life to all with spiralling\
  \ villages and city\u2019s below. As I drape my coloured coat over my tired shoulders,\
  \ one thing I will remember that the thread that ties my beautiful cloak together\
  \ came from this place that binds a wanderer, a stall owner and a rite to pass through\
  \ the mountain of its people. In an atmosphere creating the impression that old\
  \ practices need to make room for a new civilisation. Can they both live together\
  \ in harmony? This wasn\u2019t a debate I wanted to wrestle with in my mind. I just\
  \ wanted to breathe in the silent wonder. \nThis is my story, our story, separated\
  \ by seas, foreign lands and tongues and from the top of this mountain I could still\
  \ hear the song of my ancestors \u201Call things are connected, we are one\u201D\
