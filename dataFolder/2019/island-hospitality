Text: "A bright red rickshaw spluttered, coughed and came to a stop. Out shot a hand\
  \ from the passenger cabin. I shook it.  \n \n\"Hello! What are your names?\" asked\
  \ the owner of the hand. His smile glowed brightly amid the darkness of the cabin.\
  \ \n \n\"Noah. . .and this is Kye.\"  \n \n\"I'm Elanko!\" he beamed. His English\
  \ proficiency surprised us. We'd become fluent in that odd form of sign language\
  \ seemingly spoken by all travellers when interacting with the local population.\
  \ Here, it wasn't needed. \n \nWith the same piercing smile, he gestured down the\
  \ dusty track and turned back to face us. \n \n\"My house is this way. Come meet\
  \ my family, please!\" \n \nI cast a furtive glance at Kye; the midday sun beat\
  \ down hard, and our skin was an ever-deepening shade of pink. He nodded his approval.\
  \ \n \n\"We're coming!\" \n \nWith sweat streaked brows and the hope of shelter,\
  \ we followed in the rickshaw's fumy wake, our rental scooters struggling over the\
  \ rock-strewn path. India was to the west; the Sri Lankan mainland to the east.\
  \ We were on an island, somewhere in-between.  \n \nLeaping from the rickshaw, Elanko\
  \ shepherded us through the front gate. He was middle-aged and stout, with dark\
  \ brown skin and a voice like thunder. \n \n\"Welcome!\" he boomed. \n \nWe stepped\
  \ into a yard with a hard-dirt floor. Beyond it was Elanko's house, a sprawling\
  \ white island in a sea of green. In the shade of a veranda sat several people who,\
  \ unfazed by our foreignness, begged that we join their little congregation.  \n\
  \ \nThese were Tamil people\u2014ethnic Hindus who inhabit Sri Lanka's northern\
  \ region of Jaffna. We, Elanko told us, were on Nainativu, a small, palm-fringed\
  \ island off Jaffna's west coast. He had been raised here by his parents until the\
  \ early 1980s, when the nation collapsed into a state of civil war; the Tamil Tigers\
  \ militant group had entered into open conflict with the Sri Lankan Government,\
  \ desiring an independent homeland free from the control of the island's Sinhala\
  \ Buddhist majority. Fearing for their lives, Elanko fled with his family to Canada.\
  \ This was the second time he'd returned to visit since hostilities ended in 2009.\
  \  \n \nArrack flowed freely among the group. From the house came women bearing\
  \ the makings of a feast: conch meat, fresh from the shell; pots of rice and aromatic\
  \ curries, heaped to delicious excess; and, for dessert, bowls of sweet-scented\
  \ fruits, of which the rambutans were a standout delight. \n \nIt was some time\
  \ later before we regained the ability to move. Patting his belly and releasing\
  \ a dignified belch, Elanko lifted his head to speak: \n \n\"I have a boat. Would\
  \ you like to swim?\" \n \nNo more than a half hour later we were skidding across\
  \ the turquoise waters of the Palk Strait, a narrow stretch of sea separating Sri\
  \ Lanka and India. A shout from Elanko to the teenage helmsman (his nephew) saw\
  \ us drop anchor. Looking southward, he frowned.  \n \n\"See that island?\" \n \n\
  We nodded. \n \n\"That is Delft. In 1985 the Navy boarded a ferry there, on its\
  \ way to my island. Only villagers were on board\u2014no Tamil Tigers. Children,\
  \ too. The Navy chopped them up with machetes.\" \n \n\"No good,\" he said, shaking\
  \ his head.  \n \n\"No good.\" \n \nIt was sometime later back at the house that\
  \ Elanko approached us. The sun was setting, and we were preparing to leave. \n\
  \ \n\"Stay at my house tonight. We're making dinner; there's lots of room to sleep.\"\
  \ \n \nHis hospitality had reached new heights. Politely, we declined\u2014friends\
  \ were expecting us in Jaffna\u2014but the warmth and kindness of this man moved\
  \ us immeasurably. For it was in this invitation that he gave us a choice. A choice\
  \ only he knew the true value of, and a choice he never had. \n \nThe choice to\
  \ stay."
