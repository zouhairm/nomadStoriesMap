Text: "How a Nomadic Yogi Revived My Spirits:\n\nOn an early bus bound for Ipoh, my\
  \ eyes are sore, begging for rest, my cheeks dampened from an embarrassing flow\
  \ of tears. I keep my face turned towards the window to avoid the worried gaze of\
  \ locals around me. I can't even pretend to try and focus on the beautiful view\
  \ of the green hills and limestone mountains passing me by. My mind is finally clearing\
  \ from the fogginess left from drinks the night before, and I'm beginning to piece\
  \ together what has just happened. At what point did I lose control? What signs\
  \ did I not properly read? How have I let myself become a victim of rape?\n\nI made\
  \ a friend while visiting another Malaysian city, who invited me to stay with them\
  \ in Kuala Lumpur. After meeting two other women who had stayed with him recently,\
  \ I felt confident in trusting him. I had no idea that I would end the evening naked,\
  \ knees pressed up to my chest, hoping that I would wake up and realize it was only\
  \ a nightmare. I never expected to find myself feeling this kind of nakedness; ashamed,\
  \ disgusted and empty all at once. In my contorted fetal position, all I remember\
  \ is whimpering, silently mouthing for help, calling the name of a friend who was\
  \ oceans away.\n\nThis experience threw me backwards, taking a massive toll on my\
  \ confidence and self-identity that I worked so hard to acquire thus far. I always\
  \ encourage women to travel solo, saying that with a good head on their shoulders,\
  \ they have nothing to fear. I felt like I let them all down, and was ashamed to\
  \ admit what had happened to me.\n\nThough this may seem like a tragic story, the\
  \ last thing I want is pity. This is a story of hope; a story that proves that help\
  \ and reinforcement are always within reach. \n\nA few days after the incident,\
  \ I met a young woman named Delilah. She\u2019s a bubbly, energetic yogi who wears\
  \ only colourful clothing and makeup, and has a special fondness for pink. We became\
  \ instant friends and immediately started compiling silly inside-jokes. She encouraged\
  \ me to hike challenging trails with her, and shared helpful yoga stretches with\
  \ me. We spent endless time chatting about art, love, and life while we snacked\
  \ on fresh pineapple. \n\nWhen we met, I mentioned that I had a rough time in Kuala\
  \ Lumpur, but didn't elaborate further. During one of our hikes, we visited a temple\
  \ where I gave in to the sudden urge to kneel and pray. I don't remember who I was\
  \ praying to, or what I was thinking about exactly. I'm not much of a spiritual\
  \ person, but it felt good to close my eyes and let my body absorb all my thoughts.\
  \ Being the intuitive and bright spirit she is, I should have known that Delilah\
  \ would see right through me when I opened my eyes. \n\nA while later, she turned\
  \ to me and asked, \u201CWhat happened exactly, if you don't mind me asking?\u201D\
  \ Without contemplating her reaction, the entire story exploded out of my mouth\
  \ like vomit. At first, I didn't think confiding in a new friend would help me heal,\
  \ but Delilah brought back the light in me that was abruptly stolen days before.\
  \ In her, I saw the fire of courage and confidence I realized I still possessed.\
  \ She gave me the support I needed to rekindle that flame, and continue the rest\
  \ of my travels with hope. She felt sorry for me of course, but never made me feel\
  \ like I was an irrecoverable victim. She gave me advice, let me vent, and literally\
  \ helped stretch the tension out of my body. I wasn't completely healed by any means,\
  \ but the process began sooner than I ever anticipated.\n\nWhile travelling, you\
  \ encounter difficult situations no matter how safety conscious or experienced you\
  \ are. Those you love most may be oceans away, but support and healing energy can\
  \ be found in every corner of this planet. Sometimes, it magically appears when\
  \ you need it most, when you don't have the strength to seek it out yourself."
