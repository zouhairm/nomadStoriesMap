Text: "Japan became my dream in childhood. I read a lot about this country. Japan\
  \ seemed to me mysterious with its philosophy of life and unusual traditions. Japan\
  \ was close to me and far away at the same time. Only 900 km from my city, but it\
  \ was impossible to get there for a long time.\nMy wish was fulfilled last year\
  \ when I flew to Japan.\nWhen the plane landed at Osaka Airport, my heart fluttered\
  \ with delight. I liked everything. Even the dull skyscrapers did not seem so grey.\
  \ However, I was most impressed by Kyoto, the ancient city, the ancient capital\
  \ of Japan. Carefully preserved areas of nature and new buildings looked very harmonious\
  \ among the ancients.\nOne of the most famous sights of Kyoto is Fushimi Inari Shrine.\
  \ The shrine is best known for its thousands of red gates (torii), which form winding\
  \ tunnels. The road starts from the entrance to the sanctuary and stretches to the\
  \ top of the mountain. Two paths lead to the top of the mountain. One through the\
  \ red gates (torii), the second through a bamboo forest. The first road is very\
  \ crowded; hundreds of tourists want to go under the gates.\n\u201CWhich path should\
  \ I choose?\u201D\nI did not follow the crowd and chose the second path.\nClimbing\
  \ the mountain through a bamboo forest\u2026 It was an unforgettable feeling. Due\
  \ to the fact that this road was chosen by only a few people, I was left alone with\
  \ myself, alone with nature, alone with Japan. Nature, the coolness of the bamboo\
  \ forest and the silence, broken by the chant of cicadas, and the singing of birds.\
  \ What is so lacking in a noisy city. I immersed in thought and enjoyed the wonderful\
  \ surroundings. Despite the fact that August 2018 turned out to be abnormally hot\
  \ in Japan, the rise to the mountain did not seem hard.\nAt the top of the mountain,\
  \ travelers make a stop to take a breath and admire the panoramic view of the city.\
  \ I did it too. The rise was worth it. Also, at the top of the mountain two paths\
  \ were connected. I got into the corridor of the red gates. I thought that it would\
  \ be a short stretch of those red gates \u2013 maybe hundred meters or so. But I\
  \ spend an entire 2 hours! It was a good challenge, after a two-hour rise. Another\
  \ challenge was taking a picture. So keep your camera at the ready and exploit rare\
  \ moments of a view unobstructed.\nAround the road was the sculpture of foxes. Because\
  \ the goddess of the sanctuary is Inari. She is foxes\u2019 patroness. Also the\
  \ patroness of rice, sake, and prosperity. That\u2019s why most souvenirs with the\
  \ image of foxes in the souvenir shops near the shrine, and in the shrine itself.\
  \ The legend of this place says that at dusk when the corridors of the many gates\
  \ are dark, you can meet Kitsune \u2013 the spirits of foxes. I was there for about\
  \ 4 hours but did not stay until the evening for checking the legend.\nAt least\
  \ once in your life, at least for a few days, you need to visit Japan and try to\
  \ understand and feel this country full of secrets, magic and beauty. A thousand\
  \ words can't express those feelings."
