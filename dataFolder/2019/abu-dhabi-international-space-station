Text: "The halls of airports are long and repetitive. If it wasn\u2019t for the  advertisements\
  \ in Arabic, life could have you believe you were in a carpet tunnel anywhere in\
  \ the world.\n\nWalking through the halls, I notice a familiar silence behind the\
  \ drone of air conditioning and steps of faceless travelers. It is a no nonsense\
  \ silence, demanding passivity and placidity, directing us towards our next destination.\n\
  \nThe airport tunnel opens to a galactic dome. It has two colossal levels dazzling\
  \ with blue and gold lights. In the center of the dome, a large supportive structure\
  \ stands. It is painted in green, white, and adorned in gold finishings. The room\
  \ is filled by a muffled roar of people consuming fast foods and unwanted gifts.\
  \ Attendants call out over speakers, and beeps echo from stores scanning items.\
  \ Here, there are only necessary sounds, as the command of silence still reigns.\n\
  \nAirports are womb places. They are important, transitory, and safe. They allow\
  \ for an observation and interaction with cultures of the world stage. This is a\
  \ rare inclusivity, exclusive to air stations. Here, we walk around coddled in dream\
  \ states, watching.\n\nHeading towards my gate, I pass women dressed in lush black\
  \ scarves and men in white tailored Thobes. I pass Sikhs in massage chairs, and\
  \ young children sleeping. Eyes follow me as I follow theirs. \n\nMy path is glittered\
  \ by stores. Some, with large gold teapots looking like unimpressed tropical birds.\
  \ Some, with chocolates, biscuits, and teas comprised of date fruits. Others, with\
  \ gloriously overpriced items marked only in USD or UAE. \n\nThe Abu Dhabi aeroport\
  \ is one of the largest international airports in the world. It is home to over\
  \ 30 airlines, 120 destinations, 60 countries. With some of the highest international\
  \ standards, the Abu Dhabi port helped put the United Arab Emirates in the map.\
  \ \n\nArriving at my gate, there is a sea of people dressed in blue robes and yellow\
  \ bandanas. They sit dotted in almost every chair, with matching blue and yellow\
  \ bags on the ground. As I sit, I cross my legs around my backpack, and wonder where\
  \ this group is from. The group are jubilant. They are friendly, talking and bobbing\
  \ around the room in waiting. There are men, women, children, older eccentrics,\
  \ and wise ones. Using my eyes as a sponge, I watch carefully to gather any useful\
  \ information. I happen to catch white stitching on the back of the blue robes.\
  \ \u201CSAUDI ARABIA\u201D. \n\nApart from from oil, I realize I know almost nothing\
  \ about this culture, place, or people. Chancing a guess would only come from familiar\
  \ calculations, which  probably has little standing in this reality. \n\nAccepting\
  \ my ignorance, I relax into the scene around me. The flight screens are obscured,\
  \ but it is clear from the ubiquitous traditional dress, this flight is not headed\
  \ to Italy. \n\nApart from the colours, what struck me was how this group was sitting.\
  \ The eccentric and wise ones were sitting crossed legged in their chairs. Their\
  \ brown sandals laying footless on the floor. Their faces were soft and calm. They\
  \ had their eyes closed, hands on their knees. \n\nCrossed legged, they were waiting\
  \ in patient meditation. \n\nThis image cracked my mind open. Red, brown, blue,\
  \ sunsets, roads, and rivers poured out. I imagined great rugs, low furniture, and\
  \ tiled floors. I imagined struggles and I imagined love. I imagined a culture,\
  \ rich in their own tales of morality and justice. \n\nOne sudden glimpse revealed\
  \ to me the strength of culture in all times and places. \n\nIt is a wonderful thing\
  \ to understand how deeply it shapes even the simplest of our behaviour. This is\
  \ the bellezza of life. Infinite diversity. We must allow for it, look for it, and\
  \ relish it. \n\nPulled from my thoughts, I hear the flight attends call. \u201C\
  Boarding call for Emirates flight ZG100 to Jeddah. Boarding call for Emirates flight\
  \ ZG100 to Jeddah.\u201D\n\nThe Blue and Yellow sea rises. They form a doubled line\
  \ and attendants scan their passports. They start moving. One by one they disappear,\
  \ back down the long repeating halls of anywhere"
