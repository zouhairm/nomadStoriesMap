  \ about Afghanistan America War Watching on the TV news Reading Newspaper then my\
  \ conceptions was over.by the end I have done my Graduate level study at Abdul Wali\
  \ khan University Mardan Pakistan. Year mid 2016 I completed thesis.\nFour year\
  \ ago I make one plan finally time to come. I go to Afghanistan consulate Peshawar\
  \ Pakistan to get my visa country Afghanistan. I have no plan how I go to Afghanistan\

  \ terrorist living in Afghanistan  I am very scared I said to my friends who told\
  \ you my friends say to me I Watch on Tv and Internet. I said to my friends ok I\
  \ m going it\u2019s my final decision I can\u2019t believe  on media it\u2019s my\
  \ passion I want to see real situation by myself. He say to me ok go. Then I contact\
  \ to my Friend he is my school mate I contact to my afghani friend on Facebook he\

  \ I meet my childhood friend and then we will go to my friends home. One day ago\
  \ I\u2019m in Kabul me and my friend visit Mrshall fahim tomb this tomb very near\
  \ to Kabul city as a traveler I visit different provinces some place are very dangerous\
  \ Rural areas of Afghanistan Urban areas are safe  under the control of NATO and\
  \ afghan. \nAccording to my study my opinion As Travel writer Half populations of\
  \ Afghanistan Against to the USA Afghani Half populations supporting USA. Lots of\
  \ Afghani civilian woman children died during this War. Lots of American officers\
  \ .solider. and NATO forces during this War  USA lost in Afghanistan. USA  is a\
  \ super power on the World big Military USA have NATO power still Fails It\u2019\
  s a big challenge for USA Big Challenge for Afghanistan who understand this issues\
  \ and challenge. Another challenges for USA  how kick out US. Afghanistan."
