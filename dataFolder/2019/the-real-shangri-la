Text: "The powdery dirt danced beneath my feet as I struggled to get steady footing\
  \ on the steep track. My breath laboured, I took a moment of brief respite from\
  \ this pilgrimage \u2013 not the smooth sailing I\u2019d imagined for an amateur\
  \ like me. My vision limited; I was engulfed in cloud. At least I could tick that\
  \ off the bucket list \u2013 I\u2019d never walked in a cloud before! It was as\
  \ if this Himalayan Buddhist Kingdom was still reluctant to share her secrets with\
  \ me, even on my last day here. \n\nI\u2019d come to Bhutan, known as one of the\
  \ happiest countries in the world, to fulfil my dream of hiking up to Tiger\u2019\
  s Nest; the famous monastery nestled on the face of a cliff \u2013 10,240 ft above\
  \ sea level. I arrived feeling lost and hoped that by losing myself in the awe-inspiring\
  \ temples, the reverberating chants of monks and in the hidden caves of Himalayan\
  \ Saints, that I would find where happiness had been hiding all along. \n\nMy wonderful\
  \ young guide Tshering broke through the cloud to see if I was alright.\n\n\u201D\
  Yes, I\u2019m OK\u201D, I heaved. \n\nI then willed my tired feet to take another\
  \ step \u2013 disappointed that there was still no glimpse of the monastery in this\
  \ thick cloud. Tshering quietly encouraged me on, along with the occasional blue\
  \ magpies that seemed to follow us, intrigued. The silence was powerful here. That\u2019\
  s how you can tell a place is sacred \u2013 the silence. You can\u2019t escape the\
  \ sacred or the mysterious in this kingdom; they follow you like your shadow. \n\
  \nDetermined, I continued the seemingly interminable hike up as all that was revealed\
  \ was more dirt track in a shroud of grey. Tshering broke the good news \u2013 we\
  \ had climbed past the halfway point and were about to arrive at the caf\xE9. Grateful\
  \ for this break, I decided not to question how a caf\xE9 could even manage to exist\
  \ up here.  Renewed by the warm comfort of a cup of tea, I resumed my quest. As\
  \ luck would have it, or perhaps thanks to the kind Buddhas to whom I\u2019d paid\
  \ my respects in various holy sites over the past week, the clouds reluctantly decided\
  \ to part, revealing a small glimpse \u2013 my dream was in sight. \n\nI\u2019d\
  \ spent a week in this incredible country where my breath was routinely taken away\
  \ by proud mountains and untouched forests, sacred temples and colourful, peaceful\
  \ villages. A visit to one such village in the Haa Valley was strangely contrasted\
  \ by a military base filled with signs saying, \u201CThe more you train and sweat\
  \ in peace, the less you bleed in war.\u201D An uneasy reminder that Bhutan\u2019\
  s sister Tibet was not so far away, along with the might of China. \n\n\u201COh,\
  \ my gosh!\u201D I exclaimed. \n\nThe moment had come; my last few steps on the\
  \ path revealed the monastery nestled comfortably on the face of a mountain. The\
  \ white walls and red rooves adorned with gold seemed strangely at home there. The\
  \ path, covered in a rainbow of prayer flags, extended down to a waterfall which\
  \ plummeted down the mountain on my left hand side. On my right, clouds floated\
  \ lazily by, level with the monastery, while the green valley unfurled below.  \
  \ \n\nStaring in awe, I was convinced that I\u2019d stumbled on Shangri-La. Tshering\
  \ and I ventured in and paid our respects in the small cave where Padmasambhava,\
  \ the founder of Tibetan Buddhism who is reverently known as the Second Buddha,\
  \ meditated for three years. He is said to have arrived at the cave on the back\
  \ of a flying tigress \u2013 hence its name \u201CTiger\u2019s Nest\u201D. \n\n\
  Standing on the sacred ground that I thought was the end of my journey; I\u2019\
  d hoped to have come across the secret to happiness. A Bhutanese monk later told\
  \ me that the secret to lasting happiness cannot be found in fleeting things but\
  \ in love and compassion. Remembering the warmth, kindness and joy of the Bhutanese\
  \ people, I now realise that Bhutan had not been hiding her secrets from me this\
  \ whole time. The key to happiness was out in the open, patiently waiting for us\
  \ to open our eyes, as if for the very first time."
