Text: "La Tomatina you saucy festival!\PThere are no words to describe the last week\
  \ of my life. (I know for those who know me, it's not often I have nothing to say)\P\
  We all marched through the small village outside valencia, wearing our clean Whitey\
  \ tighties. 25,000 people crammed into a small street, being sprayed with freezing\
  \ cold sangria from fire hoses and cold buckets of water the locals throw over their\
  \ balconys.\LPregame entertainment, watching stupid tourists fight for the glory\
  \ of slapping the ham at the top of a lard covered pole.\PIt's mental to watch as\
  \ no one works as a team, every man for themselves. It was a vicious game. People\
  \ grabbing each other and pushing them off, one girl even broke a collarbone.\P\
  May the odds be ever in your favour. Don't ask me how but 6 trucks slowly plow their\
  \ way through the sardine packed street and threw out the tomatoes.\PAll of a sudden\
  \ I'm ankle deep in a tomato soup river as the trucks tip back their load.\PWhile\
  \ I'm here I figure I might as well make the most of it. Can many of you say that\
  \ you made a tomato angel?\PThat's another tick of the bucket list!\PThe care factor\
  \ of getting tomato in your shoes, hair, mouth and goes right out the window in\
  \ seconds.\PThe after math\PEveryone smells like salsa as the warmth or our bodies\
  \ warms the mooshy tomatoes. Shoulder to shoulder we shuffle out the streets and\
  \ back to our buses, passing and paying locals to hose us off.\PThe excitement was\
  \ over until....... the AFTER PARTY."
