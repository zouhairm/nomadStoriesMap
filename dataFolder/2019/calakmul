Text: "3 a.m. and the loudy screams outside the tent wakes me with accelerated heart\
  \ , I can\u2019t tell if they are near or far , they are just terrifying\nI was\
  \ just overcomming the mystical experience at the hidden jungle pyramid, even dreaming\
  \ about the awesome roots and threes that hugs the ruins as they were trying to\
  \ eat the past.\nI try to relax, it\u2019s raining a little and now I can tell that\
  \ the screams are not close, I think they\u2019re are even miles and miles away,\
  \ they are just so profound and deep in the silent darkness of the jungle that surprised\
  \ me, I open the tent viewer but I barely see my hands, think of going to the kitchen\
  \ were the moody host received me but don\u2019t see the point, weird attitude for\
  \ receiving the only guest in the camp, so yes, I am \nalone. \nThe screams keep\
  \ from here to there as I take my camera and push the play button to get some light,\
  \ the last picture of the bat\u2019s cave show in the viewer but is not very bright,\
  \ the bats came out at dusk so the picture is dark, I can still feel the wind that\
  \ their wings made flying by at centimeters, even between  legs.\nI\u2019m more\
  \ relaxed now, I am positive that the screams are not human and the constant and\
  \ different locations of the screams start to make sense on my head. Remember the\
  \ sign at the entrance of the park: Aulling Monkey\u2019s zone.\nI take a deep breath,\
  \ lay back again on my tent and enjoy the  beautiful 3 hours concert until get sleep."
