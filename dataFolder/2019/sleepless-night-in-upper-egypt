Text: "I can\u2019t sleep. A lizard tirelessly traversing the walls of my bedroom\
  \ in search of a meal, keeps me alert. Perhaps I would never feel comfortable in\
  \ such close proximity to these constant visitors. Majority of them are quite small\
  \ and I\u2019ve been told they are not dangerous. But in my homeland to have a close\
  \ encounter with a lizard, one have to make a long trip away from the city, and\
  \ before coming to Egypt I haven\u2019t seen many reptiles. I\u2019m trying to convince\
  \ myself that it\u2019s my ally in hunting all those tiny bugs that leave more and\
  \ more itchy traces of bites on my body. None of the members of the Egyptian family\
  \ I am visiting, seem to have this problem. Clearly my European blood must be so\
  \ irresistible. I\u2019m lucky anyway as I haven\u2019t seen a snake yet- apparently\
  \ they choose to rest in the shade of the hall on regular bases. And these can be\
  \ deadly dangerous\u2026\n   So I\u2019m not going to sleep tonight. It\u2019s too\
  \ bad as I have a busy day ahead. The ancient temples of Esna, Edfu and Kom Ombo\
  \ are my plan for tomorrow. I take an advantage of the wonderful location I\u2019\
  m staying- Qena,  some forty five minutes drive from Luxor, at the eastern bank\
  \ of the greatest African river, the Nile. On the opposite bank seats a beautiful\
  \ and best preserved in all Upper Egypt, ancient temple of goddess Hathor- Dendera.\
  \ I had an opportunity to see its most famous sculptured zodiac many years ago in\
  \ Mus\xE9e du Louvre, Paris. I reflect for a moment on the unceasing controversy,\
  \ the fact that way too many ancient treasures are to be seen now rather in French\
  \ or British museums than in the place of their origin\u2026\n   But then my thoughts\
  \ drift away from well known monuments to pretty unusual thing, which staying in\
  \ a private house of an Egyptian family undoubtedly is. And I believe it\u2019s\
  \ an experience of even greater value than visiting historical sites of this amazing\
  \ country. \n   Their house is big and three-story high, rectangular and flat, like\
  \ most of the houses here, unfinished at the top, allowing further floors to be\
  \ added. According to the local tradition, each son of the family has the right\
  \ to build his own flat on top of the ground floor one, where the parents reside.\
  \ I\u2019ve been given the best bedroom of the apartment, painted and furnished\
  \ white, with intricately ornamented, handmade wooden furniture, clearly inspired\
  \ by one of the Louis\u2019 styles. Right over my bed the massive fan is suspended-\
  \ another reason for uneasy nights. I can\u2019t get rid of the image of myself\
  \ being sliced into pieces in case it falls, but with over forty degrees Celsius\
  \ I am reluctant to not use it.\n   The center of the apartment is dominated by\
  \ a massive hall which serves also as dining room furnished in style matching my\
  \ bedroom. To my astonishment the family ignores the king-size table and twelve\
  \ comfortably upholstered chairs, having their meals served on a simple, round and\
  \  rough wooden table instead, so low that we have to seat on the floor to be able\
  \ to eat. We go through hilarious situations over the differences in what and how\
  \ we eat. Few days ago was Easter and I cooked our traditional Polish sour rye soup\
  \ served with hard-boiled eggs. Never seen this lovely people laughing so dearly\
  \ like over the egg in the soup. \n   There is a wooden bench in front of the house,\
  \ one of the kind which can be seen everywhere around the country. Men spend hours\
  \ on them even though they are extremely uncomfortable. Yesterday, tempted by the\
  \ sun, I sat there with a book. Within five minutes the whole family joined me.\
  \ Surprised, as normally they avoid the sun by all means, I discovered that it is\
  \ unthinkable for a woman to stay outdoors in the full light of the day on her own.\
  \ So they came in rescue to my honor! \n   It melted my heart. How not to love them?!\
  \ I\u2019ll forever treasure the days I spent here trying to live like a local!\
  \ And will be back one day Inshallah!"
