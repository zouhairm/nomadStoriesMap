Text: "Koh Phangan is small island in the South of Thailand. No one ever knows what\
  \ to expect on this island. I certainly did not after being invited to take part\
  \ in a healing sauna ceremony. But it was not something I was going to miss out\
  \ on, so I set off, no helmet, barefoot on my moped. It was a scorching day, as\
  \ I drove down the empty highway surrounded only by the vivid green of the tropical\
  \ woodland and a clear blue sky.\n\nI stopped just outside a temple on the highway\
  \ where I had arranged to meet my friend, Sanny. I had met this guy about a week\
  \ beforehand as he was holding a traditional Chinese tea ceremony just outside a\
  \ club in the early hours of the morning. A more eclectic mix would have been impossible.\
  \ Sanny was a Siberian hippy, with a head half-shaven half covered in dreadlocks.\
  \ The tea ceremony was set upon a wooden board with statues of Hindu deities surrounded\
  \ by classical Chinese china and clay. Nothing spelt unpredictability like this\
  \ guy.\n\nSanny arrived and led me across the road over a fence, very bluntly ignoring\
  \ the sign with bold letters: \u2018Private Property, do not trespass\u2019. What\
  \ else could one expect from Sanny? As I followed him, we soon came across a bob-wire\
  \ which I cautiously swung my legs over. I certainly would not have worn a dress\
  \ if I knew I was going to be evading sharp pieces of metal.\n\nAfter crossing a\
  \ river and jumping over a few rocks, we arrived at the final destination, at least\
  \ the physical destination, for the ceremony to come was in itself quite the journey.\
  \ We were surrounded by wild vegetation and drooping vines where a long white tipi,\
  \ sweat lodge and large stone fire pit had been constructed. Sanny told me, \u2018\
  Go find place, and relax\u2019. I did my best, but the novelty of it all instructed\
  \ my muscles otherwise. Of the participants,  A couple stared fiercely into the\
  \ fire, whilst others wondered about, seemingly fascinated by the vegetation, some\
  \ talking to themselves or something or the other in the air. One elf-like man wore\
  \ layers of pink and blue translucent fabrics which floated about in a fairy-like\
  \ way.\n\nIt had begun, we were initiated by a sound bath with a singing bowl which\
  \ must have been over a metre long. One of the officiators stroke the bowl by each\
  \ one of us. The sound oscillated and made me feel a bit like I was being abducted\
  \ by aliens. After this, we were invited to enter the sweat lodge, one by one, and\
  \ it seemed nudity was preferred over swimsuits. I joined in of course. Before we\
  \ entered we were struck, gently, several times by a branch with fresh green leaves\
  \ dipped in what seemed to be a blend of warm water and essential oils.\n\nAnd in\
  \ we went. We must have spent a total of 5 hours in the sauna, with short intervals.\
  \ At the centre of the lodge was a pit, where the officiator brought, in a shovel,\
  \ amber stones from the fire pit and deposited them. We then took turns smudging\
  \ an incense stick against the torrid stones, after which aromatic water was ceremoniously\
  \ poured over the rocks intermittently.\n\nEverything turned pitch black as a mantel\
  \ was drawn over the entrance of the lodge. Each hour represented a metaphor for\
  \ the elements, fire, water, wind and earth, and each element represented a phase\
  \ in our lives. Essentially, we were taken from cradle to grave. The darkness, humidity\
  \ and warmth of it was reminiscent of both the womb, and the idea of returning to\
  \ the earth. People just expressed whatever they needed to at that moment. It ranged\
  \ from singing, to yelling, to reciting poetry.\n\nAt every interval, I took the\
  \ opportunity to jump in the river, feeling more revitalised every time. It felt\
  \ like the water penetrated every pore of my body, flowing through me. By the end\
  \ of the session, I was like a newborn baby - every inch of me a-new.\n\nThat was\
  \ just another day in Koh Phangan, where no one knows what to expect."
