Text: "The drumming got me out of bed before the rays of the sun did. The baritone\
  \ notes of the valaga (a kind of trumpet), which followed, had my roommates rising\
  \ from their mattresses. We rushed to the window of our dormitory room to catch\
  \ a glimpse of the palanquin entering the gates. \nLight travels faster than sound,\
  \ I had learnt in school. \u201CAnd yet the nagari (drums) reached us with the news\
  \ that we are late for the ceremonies before the sun did,\u201D my grumpy sister\
  \ said, rubbing sleep out of her eyes, and heading to line up outside the bathroom.\
  \ I smiled. It wasn\u2019t the first time in my life that reason and feeling were\
  \ in contrast with each other, consequently challenging something I had been taught\
  \ to believe in. Gazing on at the palanquin-bearing priests heading past the small\
  \ pond towards the ebony pillars of the temple, I thought, \u2018Isn\u2019t that\
  \ exactly how I have landed in Shirali?\u2019\nThis tiny village had taken up many\
  \ of my summer vacations. My great aunt\u2019s house was in Kumta, the neighbouring\
  \ village; we always spend a few days there before we attended the annual chariot\
  \ festival at Shirali. At my great aunt\u2019s, I would spend my days bathing in\
  \ pump water, picking tamarinds in the farm and being spoiled by my great aunt.\
  \ In sharp contrast, my days at Shirali would be all about being made to fold hands\
  \ for the length of a ceremony or being scolded for dozing off during a ritual.\
  \ Which one I preferred is too easy.\nAs I grew up, however, I discovered the power\
  \ of questioning. I could easily push away the customs, flavours and ways of life,\
  \ that I had deeply resented being made to adhere to, using this power. \u201CEverything\
  \ you do, in life, should offer you the two things essential to your well-being\
  \ \u2013 belonging and purpose,\u201D I would argue with my parents, \u201CAnd I\
  \ find neither of those in pulling a chariot and chanting praises of the deity sitting\
  \ inside it.\u201D \nThe greenery flanking the roads of my village, the pigtails\
  \ of the girls attending its schools, the drone in the priests'chanting lulling\
  \ me to sleep, the shadows cast on my mother\u2019s face by the ebony lamps hanging\
  \ from the roof of every shrine she circumambulated, the distinct flavor of Mangalore\
  \ buns \u2013 their sweetness set off by a hint of salt and cumin, all of it faded\
  \ from my mind. became as negligible in my life as it was on the map of Karnataka.\
  \ It had taken over a decade for me to come back to the festival of the community,\
  \ which I didn\u2019t feel very connected to anymore.  \nThe swell of the valaga\
  \ made us hurry to the grounds in front of the temple, just as the deity went from\
  \ palanquin to chariot. I slipped into the library of the Math (temple), where I\
  \ spotted a book about the festival written by a local in 1973. \n\u201CIt is used\
  \ during wars as well as utsavas (festivals),\u201D he had written about the valaga.\
  \ He also mentioned how the festival provides jobs for villagers, building the chariot\
  \ to playing music and cooking. Purpose! \nI had never helped the villagers to string\
  \ flowers in the garlands that would adorn the chariot. Nor had I ever joined the\
  \ volunteers in the kitchen, old and young, cooking the meal that was going to be\
  \ fed to the whole village. I had wondered why I never felt the excitement and pride\
  \ I saw on the faces of the people over there, enthusiastically singing bhajans\
  \ (devotional songs). Maybe I had never done anything to belong to the community\
  \ and experience, along with them, the build up to the festival?\n\u201CEarlier\
  \ it was used to summon the villagers to the Math (temple) during any calamity\u2026\
  \u201D the author, who had drawn me back to my community, wrote about the nagari.\
  \ Reason and feeling were at war within me once again; and I knew which one the\
  \ sonorous drums were summoning.\nPulling the chariot and chanting praises of the\
  \ deity, with a whole village, later that day, I realized that some sounds reach\
  \ you first so they can bring you light."
