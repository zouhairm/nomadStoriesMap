Text: "\u201CLet us go, through certain half-deserted streets, \n\nThe muttering retreats\u2026\
  \u201D\n\nLet us go, through tentative one-night plans\n\nThe quiet whisperings\
  \ of doubt\n\nand demanding voices to be done about.\n\nVoices that surround like\
  \ a mythical creature beating the secret that holds the key to life and death out\
  \ of the hero and heroine\n\nand the creature is just one out of the many in the\
  \ labyrinth\n\nand the voice is just one out of the only in my mind\n\nOh, we have\
  \ lingered too long\n\nBy Google docs filled with plans- by phone calls filled with\
  \ dreams- by wanderlusts restricted by \u2026 and \u2026 and \u2026 and \u2026 and\
  \ whatnot- by the Little Mermaid\u2019s long, luscious tail wreathed with seaweed\
  \ red and brown\n\nwhy yes, she watches her prince go by-\n\nCeramics in Morocco\
  \ you say?\n\nUshguli in Georgia? Kazbegi?\n\nSalar De Uyuni?\n\nSay that again?\n\
  \nshe loves without knowing. she dreams without awaking. she lusts without desiring\n\
  \nbecause this has nothing to do with the prince,\n\nbecause the prince is nonexistent\n\
  \nbut this has everything to do with her visions\n\nOh, but we\u2019ve been lingering\
  \ too long\n\nEven the Len\xE7\xF3is Maranhense of Brazil, the Highlands of Iceland,\
  \ the glaciers of Montana would subdue\n\nso long as it quiets the muttering voices-\
  \ the voices of displeasure, wont to scream whenever routines start to form\n\n\
  Oh, keep on lingering- and one day your prince shall be married off\n\nbut you will\
  \ start living\n\nDo not ask- what? Only ask- when?"
