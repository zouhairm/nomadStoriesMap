Text: "Two hours later..\nI woke up from the taxi ride as we pulled up to Khao Yai\
  \ National Park from Bangkok. I smelled the fresh dew in the air, and stretched.\
  \ I was immediately greeted by my two tour guides for the day. \nThe journey has\
  \ finally begun. \nOn to the first hike of the day, which set the tone for how the\
  \ day was going to be. Full of surprises. \n\nMonkeys jumping around everywhere,\
  \ yelling and stealing food from my hands. This was so fascinating. \nWe loaded\
  \ up in the Jeep after the hour hike, and drove a few miles up the rode to get a\
  \ better view of the family of Northern pig-tailed macaques. Swinging from tree\
  \ to tree, eating fruits, and just laying around. Colors of Black, Brown, and Black.\
  \ We walked about a mile on the side of the rode taking pictures along with other\
  \ travelers and guides. \n\nAs we approached the campgrounds on our way to lunch\
  \ there was a family of Indian Muntjacks roaming around and laying in the grass.\
  \ The view was unreal. Campers walked around them and they stayed in place. This\
  \ is what I was missing humans and nature living amongst each other in perfect harmony.\
  \ \n\nI wandered off after lunch, into another entry the jungle nearby. I stumbled\
  \ upon a waterfall. The most peaceful trance I have ever come across. \nStanding\
  \ there with my eyes closed, allowing the breeze to caress my face and the sounds\
  \ to whisper in my ears. I spun around fast to get the perfect view on camera. After\
  \ 5 tries, I got it. \n\nReturning to the Jeep, we drove around for what seemed\
  \ like forever but I was just so happy to be in the jungle still. Experiencing something\
  \ of another world. I fell asleep in the back. \n\"Get up!\" \n\"There it is!\"\n\
  \"We found one!\" \nI knew then, that we finally ran into an Elephant. \nI rose\
  \ like a bat out of Hell. \nHere comes the Ranger, other guides and people on tours,\
  \ and us. Way too much excitement for the Elephant he left. \n\nDisappointment started\
  \ to sink in until the two guides suggested we quietly follow the Elephant to the\
  \ opposite side of the jungle in the Jeep. \nA few miles later of fast driving and\
  \ adrenaline rushing through the roof. \nWe finally get to the other side in what\
  \ seems to be an eternity but could have only been 5 minutes.\n\nThere he was as\
  \ calm as a field of snow.\n\nEating. \nWatching us.\nChomping on the leaves that\
  \ were hanging on the branches.\n\nI stood from the street in admiration that I\
  \ finally witnessed an elephant in its natural habitat. \nOne of the most beautiful\
  \ animals, and just watching him eat made me jump for joy.\nI stood there thinking\
  \ that this is the moment that I turned my experience as a solo tourist into a solo\
  \ travel.\nBy taking one leap into the unknown at a time I can always experience\
  \ these moments of pure joy. \nThen, just like that my 2nd solo trip to Thailand\
  \ was over."
