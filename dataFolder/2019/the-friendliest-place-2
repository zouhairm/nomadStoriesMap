Text: "It was getting darker very quickly. The path was not clear and the jungle seemed\
  \ to be alive. Heavy rains had been falling during the last week. They said it was\
  \ the tail of the hurricane.\nMy partner was somehow more used to the inclemencies\
  \ of weather but La Pampa was soft nature compared to Costa Rica\xB4s wild nature.\n\
  \nWe still don't know where he came from or why we stop. Out of nowhere a hitchhiker\
  \ was standing on the side of the road and we agreed to take him with us. After\
  \ a while we realized the guy was drunk and it hadn't been good idea.\n\nEvery bridge\
  \ we had to cross felt like about to broke.\n\nNoises of wild animals and the dark\
  \ night started to make us feel uneasy.\n\nSuddenly our hired truck stopped and\
  \ wouldn't start again. We didn't dare to go out of the car as the animals out there\
  \ could be dangerous. But there was no choice so nervously, we stepped out of the\
  \ car and try to fix it.\nLuckily a bus stopped to help. After a while some police\
  \ cars arrived and in a minute the bus and the drunk guy had disappeared into the\
  \ night.\n\nWe have heard a lot of stories about police and military in Central\
  \ America by that time so we were really scared.\n\nThey began asking questions\
  \ and forced us back into the car. Both of us - we knew that later- had an image\
  \ of us shot inside the car.  It didn't look good...\n\nAfter many questions they\
  \ realized we were just a couple of young guys that had rented the wrong truck.\
  \ Instead of going to an official rental we rented it from a local and it seemed\
  \ it was stolen. \n\nOnce this was clarified, the policemen became the nicest people.\
  \ They lifted us and drove to the next village making jokes and being super wharm\
  \ and caring.\n\nThe remaining days of our trip were amazing, discovering the nicest\
  \ beaches, incredible landscapes, jungle, volcanos, and the friendliest people ever.\n\
  \nPeople in Costa Rica are very nice and they have the most peaceful country in\
  \ the region to the point of no having an army and they are the oldest democracy\
  \ in Central America.\n\nWe learned that about the country and also that wild nature\
  \ at night can be very intimidating..."
