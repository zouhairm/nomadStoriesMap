Text: "I sit by a Stupa at an elevation above the shore of a flowing river in the\
  \ Himalayan Spiti region, shielding myself from the sun. It\u2019ll be a good sixty\
  \ minutes before my co travelers reach the place on their yak ride. I chose to ride\
  \ a van to the Stupa to avoid the punitive sun. Spiti is inexplicable that way,\
  \ one can be sunburnt and also shiver in the shade simultaneously. I stand under\
  \ the shade of the Stupa and force myself to wear the cowl of my sweatshirt to protect\
  \ from the strong icy cold wind. \n\nTo distract myself from the battle with the\
  \ weather and as I wait for the others, I stroll around and reach a viewpoint on\
  \ an abandoned rooftop and rest myself down, overlooking the mix of muddy and green\
  \ landscape, perched huts and colorful prayer flags symbolic of Buddhism flutter\
  \ in the wind. Like how we leave something of ourselves behind when we leave a place,\
  \ likewise small moments, discoveries like these that inspire me to travel, I think\
  \ to myself.\n\nAs I get up to leave, a little friend appears out of nowhere and\
  \ opens her little fist to reveal a beautifully carved ammonite fossil that she\
  \ offers to me. As I look around to see if she\u2019s is accompanied by anyone else,\
  \ I chose to hand her a bar of chocolate and we exchange smiles as she disappears\
  \ into a path probably where her other companions headed away. \nThat evening, I\
  \ sat in the caf\xE9 having dinner on my own and get chatty with Norbu, who works\
  \ at the caf\xE9, which promotes responsible travel and helps build sustainable\
  \ programs at Spiti. Spiti is in every traveler\u2019s list to visit, a dreamy land,\
  \ even with severe conditions in the backdrop of snow-hooded Himalayas. Norbu shares\
  \ many insights into this tiny land and one such was about the nunnery. \n\nI had\
  \ never been to a nunnery and all my imagination was only in my curious mind, so\
  \ I get anxious to learn more about their life yet not cross any line into insensitivity.\n\
  \nNorbu inevitably becomes the victim of my questions and he heartily abides, as\
  \ it was his end of day at the cafe. He continues to share their lifestyle, daily\
  \ routine, revealing most of them have been at the nunnery for over 10 years and\
  \ many of them move in at a young age out of their own choice and become a student.\
  \ He plucks a postcard from the small caf\xE9 store to show me a bunch of young\
  \ girls dressed in traditional red robe with a blue veil, I guess their age as young\
  \ 6 to 22 and their twinkling eyes filled with young innocence that was hard to\
  \ miss as they pose. \nAs we laugh over trivial facts, Norbu and I continue to talk\
  \ about their lives, I remain conscious enough. \nEach day the nuns wake up early\
  \ for morning prayers, spend upto 12 hours a day studying various subjects, work\
  \ at the bio gardens, do their homework, help in the kitchen and end the day with\
  \ their evening prayers. Each day is a practiced routine, quite similar to the next.\
  \ \nLife is harsh and rigorous for them; especially winter months, with temperatures\
  \ below -15 degrees and surviving without any robust heating facilities and with\
  \ only the stocked up food. When my eyes widened with awe, Norbu dismissed my sigh\
  \ and disclosed that they spend many nights studying under the moonlight in the\
  \ summers. A consolation was that they had access to education. \n\nNorbu reveals\
  \ in a funny note that many are scared of their head nuns and pause all activities\
  \ upon sighting her, they oblige when travelers photographs them and their love\
  \ for instant noodles and how they hide the packets in their robes as they walk\
  \ from the villages. \n\nNorbu and I wrap up our conversation to be ready for a\
  \ namchi (local doctor) session early morning the next day. \n\nAs I lay in bed\
  \ that night, I could picture their evening prayers and their simplistic life stirs\
  \ something in my soul. A life that they have carved for themselves that an outsider\
  \ probably cannot discover."
