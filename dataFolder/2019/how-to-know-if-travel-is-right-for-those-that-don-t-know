Text: "\u201COne is never afraid of the unknown; one is afraid of the known coming\
  \ to an end.\u201D\n\n- Jiddu Krishnamurti (1998)\n\n \n\nA truly fantastic quote\
  \ from one of the great travelers of the world, and only through hindsight am I\
  \ able to deeply reflect on what it means to me.\n\nIn 2012 I was 20 years old,\
  \ fresh out of culinary school and working as a chef in the tourism hub of New Zealand,\
  \ Queenstown; often referred to by it\u2019s transient locals as \u2018The Bubble\u2019\
  \ due to the fact that it has little resemblance to anywhere else in New Zealand,\
  \ and you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find many Kiwis who actually live there.\n\n\
  I buried myself into my work clocking in 80-100 hours a week in a desperate effort\
  \ to succeed. I never even looked at the many tourist attractions Queenstown offers,\
  \ extreme bungee jumps, glorious nature hikes, cliff diving spots and more that\
  \ a 700-word limit doesn\u2019t give room for. I didn\u2019t understand how to be\
  \ a tourist in your own country. I was surrounded by nomads, travelers and vagabonds,\
  \ each with their own thrilling tales of the world which I had yet to truly explore.\
  \ At the time, what I knew, was work. Work hard and you will succeed; I still believe\
  \ that today, except today I understand that \u2018work\u2019 isn\u2019t restricted\
  \ to your day job.\n\nSo, as with most good stories, I met a girl. An American girl\
  \ whose passion for travel and new experiences converted me to a tourist even in\
  \ my own country. I explored, I bungee-jumped and hated it, I fell in love with\
  \ hiking, I saw my own world in a whole new and exciting light.\n\nMad with this\
  \ newfound passion to experience new things, we started planning a rather overly-ambitious\
  \ 9 month trip through South East Asia. We booked a flight to Bangkok, Thailand,\
  \ 5 nights stay in a guesthouse, and an exit flight 9 months later from Bangkok\
  \ again. That was our idea of planning at the time.\n\nOur very first experience\
  \ upon landing in Bangkok, the taxi driver didn\u2019t understand where our guesthouse\
  \ was and simply dropped us off on Khao San Road, a 15 minute drive from our accommodation,\
  \ the Lee House Inn in Bang Rak. We must have looked very lost and confused as a\
  \ local woman working at a Starbucks, we happened to be standing outside of, rushed\
  \ out and offered us assistance. She hailed a tuk-tuk driver and directed him to\
  \ where we needed to go. Having finally arrived, I\u2019d like to quickly say that\
  \ very rarely is backpacker accommodation going to be a luxurious affair, especially\
  \ at our budget, but this place was a shock to the system. 38\xB0C in a room with\
  \ no windows, a fan that appeared to be powered positive intentions and a bed where\
  \ those same positive intentions went to die. These were only very minor challenges\
  \ of the many more increasingly major challenges yet to come. Sketchy border crossings,\
  \ language barriers, motorcycle accidents and all of which we came out better off\
  \ than we had been before, either physically or mentally.\n\nWhat a rush it all\
  \ was! We were challenged, we overcame, and we succeeded. This theme repeated itself\
  \ over again for the remainder of the trip and every subsequent trip I\u2019ve been\
  \ with that American girl, now my wife. I no longer fear the unknown because through\
  \ that trip I now know that I, and without a doubt you, the reader, are completely\
  \ able overcome what may seem impossible challenges.\n\nNow you may be thinking\
  \ that I should\u2019ve written about the specific details of that trip, and I can\
  \ only apologize when I say this tale wasn\u2019t written with you in mind. Though\
  \ please do know that I am immensely grateful that you\u2019ve given me your time\
  \ to read this far.\n\nThis tale was written for those of you who have that itch\
  \ to travel, and even for those that have never had that itch. Do the research,\
  \ book the flight, find love, find adventure, find freedom. Don\u2019t grip on to\
  \ what you have but let go to discover that there\u2019s an entire world of life-changing\
  \ experiences to be had."
