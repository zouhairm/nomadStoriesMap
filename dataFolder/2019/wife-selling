Text: "When I went to Egypt, more precisely in the region of Luxor, to realize dream\
  \ of knowing more of Egypt's wonderful history and its pyramids, temples and citadels\
  \ (and hide a camel, of course), my wife and I were heading for the entrance complex\
  \ of the Karnak temple, when we were faced with the need to pass heavily armed soldiers.\
  \ \nwe are both extremely friendly and love making contact with local culture and\
  \ people from the place we are meeting. Behold, I begin to chat with some soldiers\
  \ in a friendly manner to learn more about the temple, the region, and so on. A\
  \ slightly older soldier, with a machine gun across his chest, asks me to be taken\
  \ to a separate room to talk to him. He was very smiling, as well as everyone in\
  \ the environment, so I was not scared or even afraid, I warned my wife that I would\
  \ go back and so I went, without even imagining what he would propose.\nAfter a\
  \ few minutes \"surrounding,\" the soldier, whom I supposed to be the highest graduate\
  \ there, because he was not wearing any kind of uniform, only a cap with a badge\
  \ that was unknown to me, asks me if \"the blonde with me was my wife.\" Without\
  \ wary of what would come next, I respond affirmatively, with conviction.\nTo my\
  \ utter surprise, the Soldier whom I was talking to made the following proposal:\
  \ do you agree to sell it? How many camels would you like to change her for?\nAfter\
  \ a few seconds trying to process what I had heard, doubting my ability to understand\
  \ English (I'm not fluent) or cheering to get it wrong, I just answer him\"what?\"\
  I just laughed, even though all the soldiers around were standing still and looking\
  \ at me, waiting for my response. The older soldier reaffirms his offer with a more\
  \ serious tone and even improves the price: I pay as many camels as you want.\n\
  Nervously, I say that unfortunately she was not for sale, and even if she were,\
  \ I could not take the camels to my house in Brazil, just to be polite with him.\n\
  Meanwhile, as is the local custom, locals take pictures with my wife, who could\
  \ not wait for me anymore, in the heat of that  sunny and boiling day, about 45\
  \ celsius. She did not even think she was being negotiated.\nA few soldiers who\
  \ accompanied the negotiation were absolutely astonished and looked at me with a\
  \ regret of who missed a great opportunity or who stopped doing a great deal. They\
  \ could not believe that I had refused such a tempting proposal!\nI did not know\
  \ what the \"major's\" reaction would be to the rejection of the big deal he had\
  \ proposed to me, but it was clear that I could only deny it, even if there was\
  \ any threat or retaliation.\nMy wife, who peered at us through the large glass\
  \ window of the room we were talking to, began to worry about the change in our\
  \ faces, rather smiling, for much more serious expressions. He gestured to know\
  \ what was happening and I, just not to worry her, gestured back that he did not\
  \ care.\nThere was a great silence in the room. I heard someone cocking a gun. I\
  \ started to sweat a lot more than I already sweating. The old soldier grabs the\
  \ table, gently, and says he's missing out on a big deal. But he accepted and, just\
  \ like a gentleman, shakes hand with me and asks his soldiers to accompany me to\
  \ the exit.\nThe soldiers who accompanied me tried to dissuade me, in Arabic, which\
  \ I don\xB4t understand a word of, but I could see its purpose. I just nodded, negatively,\
  \ with a fake smile on my lips.\nWhen my wife saw my expression, she knew something\
  \ strange had happened, and she asked me what had happened in that room. I explained\
  \ that it was being negotiated, and I started to laugh, relieved. \nShe was outraged\
  \ at being considered a commodity in the middle of the twenty-first century, but\
  \ I was only too happy that she had come out of that unusual situatio"
