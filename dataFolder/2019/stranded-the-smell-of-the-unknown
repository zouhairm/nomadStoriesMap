Text: "Our traveling pastime has become a spontaneity for many.  But, in Summer 2016,\
  \ it became my necessity.  \n\nMy Grandmother\u2019s death sucked all plans to dwindle.\
  \  The sweet, sweating metal on the window ledge dribbled cool, the packed clay-grey\
  \ sands on our home shoreline sunken cold.  What followed was yet another pitfall.\
  \  University mislaid my examination papers, forcing me to re-sit.  I sought out\
  \ the knowledge of a local tutor, a crashing surf of emotions that entwined both\
  \ my yearn to pass my exams, but also my fury at our recent loss.  An intellectual\
  \ grieving.  But he was no tutor.  Quickly, his tutoring led to hands delving into\
  \ undiscovered boundaries.  Tongue-stunned, my summer break suddenly became victimised\
  \ in itself.  It became a journey through the Courtroom, far from any kind of journey\
  \ I\u2019d imagined \u2013 that spontaneity of travel.  \n\n3 days later I packed\
  \ up.  Trauma finally drove me onto a one-way plane, and yes, I was running from\
  \ my problems, quite literally.  I\u2019d never ventured the other side before,\
  \ but being deafblind, it\u2019d been a mission nonetheless to \u2018see\u2019 the\
  \ world\u2019s wonders before losing all sight.  Now I was doing just that.  Only,\
  \ I was also journeying to provide another comfort \u2013 to my friend, a student\
  \ who was residing in a 22nd floor flat amongst a colourful calypso of \u2018Jenga\u2019\
  \ blocks, mooching precariously above a corner of Hong Kong.  She too had succumbed\
  \ to some troubles, so it seemed right to embrace some enlightening adventure together.\
  \  But, upon arrival, a turn of events changed her mind \u2013 I was blocked from\
  \ her contacts and told bluntly that I could no longer stay.  Stranded.  Just myself,\
  \ my suitcase and my long, white cane.  \n\nCrude wafts of sticky oil fizzed low.\
  \  The heavy heat snaked through each backstreet, its hot void trapped, a city within\
  \ a greenhouse.  My cane cracked and rumbled as I stumbled over uneven slabs, windows\
  \ and washing-lines towering over with warm, glaring eyes, shafts of green daylight.\
  \  But the city\u2019s other onlookers weren\u2019t so warm, or so it seemed.  They\
  \ were curious, if not, afraid, by the long white stick I forced through each pave\
  \ and crack.  The locals leapt away, scooping up their toddlers, thick bobs of glossy\
  \ black hair shimmering in the hazy sunlight, squeals of gooey breath as they slurped\
  \ on bright matcha teas, sweet and plasticky.  An elderly woman, huddled up in her\
  \ shop doorway, cursed at me, pointing one stern finger whilst she tossed greasy\
  \ worms of delicate noodle.  They smelt delicious.  \n\nA taxi rattled across the\
  \ road, coppered red doors, horn screeching.  Thrusted into the doorway, I pressed\
  \ against a wall, only inches to inhale as the vehicle squirmed past.  Behind, clinking\
  \ cheap crockery chimed amidst hurried warbles of conversation, incoherent and fragmented.\
  \  The doorway led into the cranny of community caf\xE9.  A lady pulled out a three-legged\
  \ stool beneath the small, yellow table, ushering me to sit down.  I folded up my\
  \ cane and crouched.  She whipped out a menu, poised ready with pen and paper, but\
  \ it was scribbled in Cantonese, each with a low-resolution picture.  They were\
  \ too small for me to see.  Pointing spontaneously at a picture she whipped back\
  \ the menu and scampered away before returning with a steaming plate, ribbons of\
  \ red beef twizzled in pungent black bean.  They were greasy worms of delicate noodle.\
  \  Delicious.  But the service was lukewarm.  With haste, my plate was snatched\
  \ away and the bill crumpled into my hand.  Fast-food certainly went by its word\
  \ in Hong Kong.  Upon leaving, an elderly lady cursed at me, sandwiched behind her\
  \ wok counter.  She pointed a stern finger as I went closer, when, from her apron\
  \ pocket, she pulled out a piece of paper.  On it was an enlarged picture, low-resolution.\
  \  A dish of noodles, greasy and steaming, red curls of beef.  Her face creased\
  \ like the crumpled bill.  She smiled, pointing to my eyes.  I laughed, bowing my\
  \ head with thanks, before placing the picture into my pocket and leaving.  Wandering\
  \ out onto the narrow street, red taxis rumbling past, my long, white cane glided\
  \ smoothly along the street, as I ventured out again, seeking out the smell of the\
  \ unknown."
