Text: "It was the end of December of 2015 and I was preparing myself for some days\
  \ off in Havana, a place I always wanted to visit and witness for myself if the\
  \ rumours about the island were true. While I was finishing packing and getting\
  \ ready for my early flight next morning, I received a call from my boss, asking\
  \ me to start working on an urgent and complex assignment to be delivered in a day.\
  \ While I was listening over the phone I realized my heart was violently pumping\
  \ \u2013 my holidays were over. After thinking about it for a couple of hours, I\
  \ decided not to cancel my trip, not only because it was all paid but also because\
  \ I really needed the time off. I worked as hard as I could but unable to finish,\
  \ I finally called my boss from the airport and offered her to check my cellphone\
  \ and email as soon as I landed in Havana and continue with the assignment. Little\
  \ I knew that I was visiting a place where this was a remote possibility. \n\nWhen\
  \ I arrived at the airport I noticed that there was no wi-fi connection and although\
  \ I knew that in Cuba the internet was very limited and restricted, I was still\
  \ hoping to get some luck either on the airport or the hotel. Hours later, it was\
  \ pretty clear that wi-fi was not available and If I wanted to access for some minutes\
  \ I had to pay a considerable fee. Anxious and stressed for not even being able\
  \ to work, I had no option but to gave up on it and decided to enjoy my time there\
  \ as I planned before, however the busy schedule of activities and places I wanted\
  \ to visit was also not possible, since New Year's Eve coincides with the anniversary\
  \ of Cuba\u2019s Revolution and it is a difficult season to find museums, restaurants\
  \ and touristic attractions open to public. What it seemed like a relaxed and fun\
  \ trip to Havana, quickly turned into a nightmare holiday or at least that is what\
  \ I thought then\u2026\n\nNot following a schedule and disconnected against my will,\
  \ I was adapting myself to the unique pace of Havana where nothing is urgent and\
  \ days last more than 24hrs. Slow and simple, I discovered that its biggest treasure\
  \ is not its museums or the nightlife or even entertainment; it is the people and\
  \ the way they experience life every day. I\u2019ve spent countless hours wondering\
  \ around the Malecon, watching youngsters and couples hanging out, I\u2019ve also\
  \ got lost in La Habana Vieja looking for a place to eat and miraculously find a\
  \ family that owned a Paladar were only a limited number of dishes from the menu\
  \ were available and all of them were delicious \u2013 and finally \u2013 I walked\
  \ for hours to find the famous Helader\xEDa Coppelia where there was only one ice\
  \ cream for tourists \u2013 strawberry. Things in Cuba move at a different speed\
  \ and even if you are a foreigner you are slowly absorbed into the vibe that Socialism\
  \ has deeply imprinted in the country. There\u2019s no point in trying to speed\
  \ up things; you get only what it is available and things will happen anyway. This\
  \ is a particular shock for someone like me coming from a massive city where everyone\
  \ is in a hurry to produce and to plan and the time is not enough to complete everything;\
  \ even though you are expecting a quiet moment during your holidays to \u2018disconnect\u2019\
  , you are still very engaged to social media and running around the clock. \nBy\
  \ the second day, I had surrender to this new routine and that is when I truly started\
  \ enjoying myself. New Years\u2019 eve came and I found myself dancing reggaeton\
  \ and salsa with a bunch of strangers and an improvised music band \u2013 I was\
  \ enjoying life as never before. I didn\u2019t care anymore about my pending issues\
  \ or the plan for the next day, and as I watch the sunrise I realised I was ready\
  \ to quit my job."
