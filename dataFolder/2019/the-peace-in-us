Text: "I could write about Amsterdam or even about Madrid, two of the cities that\
  \ conquered my heart and took a piece of my soul. Instead, I'm going to tell you\
  \ about Costa Vicentina, the trip that made me go a little deeper in my feelings,\
  \ in my relationship with my cousins and in my innerpeace.\nPeople always say that\
  \ we have to see the world, there's a urge to do that as soon as possible. If you\
  \ don't travel much, you're missing everything, you've to see x, y and z cities/countries.\
  \ I AGREE. However, I've been traveling Portuguese cities and I've come to grow\
  \ in my own country.\nCosta Vicentina is one of the mandatory journeys, the one\
  \ you really have to do if you're portuguese. It's like seeing paradise in every\
  \ step you make. Every breath you take is a leap of faith, of trust, of stillness,\
  \ of tranquility. There's nothing wrong, everybody is so relaxed that you assume\
  \ that shape and don't get rid of it very quickly. I use to say that, whenever I\
  \ want to escape from my controversed days, I just close my eyes and go back to\
  \ all the beaches, all the camping places I've been. And it works. Perfectly.\n\
  It's funny that I'm telling you about this, because, the other day, in Lisbon, I\
  \ was having lunch with my cousin and a finland couple that was devoted to yoga\
  \ asked us about what beaches were worth it and we just kept talking for hours about\
  \ the ones we saw.\nWe started for Comporta, where all the fancy people go, it was\
  \ a hot sunny day and there were mosquitos all around, but not even that stoped\
  \ us from having a blast and dive in the water. We follow to Gal\xE9 Beach where\
  \ we slept in a Camping Park that had night shows and was a lot of fun, we watched\
  \ the sunset in the mountains near the beach and danced until late in the dinning\
  \ park.\nThe next day, we went to Porto Covo, one of the most beautiful places I've\
  \ ever seen. It was all so clean and at the same time so simple. We left our stuff\
  \ in the park and visited Samouqueira, Buizinhos and Porto Covo Beaches. As you\
  \ can imagine, we spent a lot of time trying to collect little shells in the Buizinhos\
  \ Beach that are one of my cousins favourite nature work of art. That night we chose\
  \ a very familiar restaurante to eat sardines and grilled vegetables with wine and\
  \ beer, those little plesures.\nOn the third day, we headed to Vila Nova de Milfontes,\
  \ where we just enjoyed a little time and caught some sun, passed Zambujeira do\
  \ Mar and left our stuff in Odemira, that was near Odeceixe where he had very good\
  \ italian food!\nThe last day, we drove until Arrifana, one beautiful treausure,\
  \ we just had to go down and down, round and around, and finally we saw a perfect\
  \ blue sea filled with perfect waves. After four hours of pure excitement and sun,\
  \ we had lunch on the top of the mountains with perfect view for the horizon.\n\
  Our journey seemed over but we still had a long ride home, so we drove near the\
  \ coast, so that we could see all the beaches while we were dancing and talking\
  \ in the car.\nWhenever I miss them and this stilness, I just get back to those\
  \ perfect moments and have a beautiful trip in my head. In fact, we can also live\
  \ through our memories."
