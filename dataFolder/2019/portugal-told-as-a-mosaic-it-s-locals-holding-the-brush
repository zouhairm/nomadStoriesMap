Text: "On this journey, I would carry nothing but a notebook, a pen, and a backpack\
  \ with just enough in it to keep me clothed, and pleasantly scentless. Other than\
  \ these material things, I would only be holding a hunger to create connections\
  \ with Portuguese locals and all the stories they have to tell me. I would follow\
  \ them in things as mundane as their daily routines, to examples of how they carry-out\
  \ celebrations. I would try every modern gelato flavour the local parlour has invented,\
  \ to the flavours their ancestors remedies hundreds of years ago. \nIf I'm going\
  \ to read a piece or watch a movie about somewhere in the world that is foreign\
  \ to me, I want to hear about what that location means to the people that call it\
  \ \"home\". I want to read descriptions so vivid that if I close my eyes, I can\
  \ feel the Portuguese sun waking me up from the inside out and the sweetness of\
  \ apricot juice quieting down my thirst. I want to hear conversations with the Old\
  \ Lady that has lived in that apartment her whole life, and watched her city go\
  \ through the inevitable march of progression, yet still hold the culture she grew\
  \ up surrounded by. I want to be able to close my eyes, and be transported to this\
  \ place without purchasing a plane ticket. I suppose even the best pieces, though,\
  \ haven't provided me with enough detail to completely ease my curiosity of and\
  \ yearning to experience very country myself. \nA couple years ago, I was at a friend's\
  \ house drinking wine over a \"vegan charcuterie board\" (whatever that means).\
  \ As we chatted, a show played in the background that's premise is a lucky man travelling\
  \ the world and tasting all the delightful foods that his destinations have to offer.\
  \ As I took a bite of that soy cheese, I watched shots on the screen of custard\
  \ tarts being plated up, next to lattes that looked crafted with clouds. The cafe\
  \ being shown was tucked into the cement walls of an alley, being scaled by pedestrians\
  \ and small electric scooters. Nothing dulled the sound of the conversations being\
  \ had by the friends and families over their breakfast's or morning snacks. The\
  \ street was multi-coloured and screaming for a camera's attention. It was the type\
  \ or cinematography that you could pause and  would be able to frame however the\
  \ shot froze to put on your wall. The show played montages of Lisbon's different\
  \ buildings, locals laughing, and bakers and chef's making delicacies that it was\
  \ apparent they'd made millions of times before. I noticed immediately how even\
  \ some of the house's roofs had vibrant tile laid across them. I thought, \"Wow.\
  \ A city that is so tentative to it's beauty that even it's rooftops are decorated.\"\
  \ I knew in this moment that I would love to have the privilege of visiting and\
  \ beholding Portugal so that I could step into the art that it is and feel it. Feel\
  \ the ceramic walls, the salted fish sting my tongue, the arms of locals wrap around\
  \ me after educating me on their quality of life, and the unique warmth of the Portuguese\
  \ sun. \nI am a twenty year old living in British Columbia. I study Writing at the\
  \ University of Victoria and am grateful everyday that I get to study something\
  \ I am passionate about. My dream job has always been to work for National Geographic.\
  \ The thought of travelling to other parts of the world to tell people's stories\
  \ through both their words and my own is my ideal career. Of course not all of these\
  \ stories would be happy ones, but I feel that the best forms of education are travel\
  \ and sharing stories and I carry the belief that everyone should be aware of the\
  \ beauty and the tragedy that is being felt by people that inhabit a different spot\
  \ on this Earth than they do. If given this opportunity, I would strive to familiarize\
  \ myself with this country by making friends, discovering the way the waves of the\
  \ Ocean breaks on a surfboard, and strolling down every tiled alleyway I stumble\
  \ upon (custard tart in-hand)."
