Text: "Six hours of flight. Totally exhausted. A very cold night. A single pair of\
  \ pants and a thin coat in my bag. The first night in Santiago was the most incredible\
  \ thing i\u2019ve ever done in my intire life, and the scariest, at the same time.\n\
  \nEvery morning, my friend and i were in diferente places. When my eyes were barely\
  \ even open yet, i could only think in how many people\u2019s stories i would know\
  \ that day. I\u2019ve always had an interest in people\u2019s stories. But how could\
  \ i know them if i dont understand a single word they\u2019re saying? I got out\
  \ of my bed a little bit sad.\n\nIn the hotel restaurant i heard a \u201Cbom dia\u201D\
  . In the supermarket a heard a \u201Ctudo bem?\u201D with a carioca accent. Brazilians\
  \ were in everywhere. From the subway to the city hall. I had just realized my schedules\
  \ were around me all the time.\n\nIn Pirque, about 40 km from Santiago, i met my\
  \ first interview with a love story. I was going to the Concha y Toro winery and\
  \ when i get there the tourist guide was chilean? No, of course not. He was brazilian.\
  \ \n\nAt the end of the tour i asked him for an interview. He did not understand\
  \ why, but he accepted. He told me that he came to chile looking for \u201Cthe love\
  \ of his life\u201D. He met her by exchanging letters. With great pride in his eyes,\
  \ he said that today they are married and have three children and many grandchildren.\n\
  \nWere about tem minutes of conversation and all the time he held his wedding ring\
  \ and sought his wife, who was a chef at the winery. He wanted to tell the story\
  \ along with her, but we had to say goodbye because he had to take another tour.\n\
  \nIn the way back to Santiago i started to think how afraid i was at the first day\
  \ and i thought \u201Cwhy the hell i was afraid?\u201D. I had just realized that\
  \ it was an irrational fear, and grew my desire to be a tourism journalist. Hear\
  \ people\u2019s stories and tell them. That\u2019s my dream."
