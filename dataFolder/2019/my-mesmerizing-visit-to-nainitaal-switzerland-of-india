Text: "Nainital is commonly known as Lake District of India, located in the state\
  \ of Uttrakhand at about 1900m above sea level. It gives you a much- needed break\
  \ from your hustle bustle life you have always yearned for. It is surrounded with\
  \ splendid lakes and scenic natural beauty. Despite being a peaceful place it is\
  \ filled with adventurous sports such as yachting, boating, paragliding, and bungee\
  \ jumping. It happened last month when I had a chance to visit Nainital and some\
  \ nearby cool places like Jim Corbett along with my friend. Endowed with the astounding\
  \ natural beauty, the pure and clean air in the uphills was perfectly pleasant.\
  \ Nainital is the best place to go and relax. The all the nine taals have a special\
  \ significance attached to it. Nainital derives its name from the Naini lake, signifies\
  \ eyes of Sati. The lake itself has the shape of an eye. It is said that when Lord\
  \ Shiva was carrying the burnt body of Goddess Parvati, some parts of her body fell\
  \ into 64 places and one of them being Nainital. These places where the parts of\
  \ the body fell are called as Shakthi peeks. Because of its simplistic natural beauty,\
  \ Nainital is the most preferred location for family trips, honeymoon and college\
  \ trips. It has various romantic spots like Naini lake and snow viewpoint. Children\
  \ can enjoy at the admiral Nainital Zoo.\n It was not possible for us to visit all\
  \ the taals at the same time but we could manage to visit two, Khurpa taal and Nainitaal.\
  \ The Khurpa taal where we stayed has greens all around, in fact its greens all\
  \ over the hills. Khurpa taal is a beautiful small dull green colored lake known\
  \ for anglers. It is located at the outer of Nainital and is about 11kms away from\
  \ Nainital city. It is about 1600m above sea level and due to this high altitude,\
  \ this place is rarely visited by the tourists. Moreover, tourists are less attractive\
  \ because it is less visible to the visitors by the hills. It is like secret heaven\
  \ on earth yet to be explored by the peace lovers. And because of less human traffic\
  \ in that area, it is still blessed with the natural environment and beauty. It\
  \ is far away from the reach of human pollution. \nTerraced farming is the most\
  \ popular pattern of farming in hills. Residents sow mainly vegetables. The village\
  \ folks in that area can be seen frequently, engaged in vegetable farming. This\
  \ area is best for farming due to the adequate amount of rain following throughout\
  \ the year. For tourists who love fishing, it is the best place for hangout in peace.\
  \ Apart from this, it is the best place who loves natural scenery. The area is well\
  \ covered by tall trees. People also plant a lot of fruit trees in their homes and\
  \ farms. One can see the fruit trees throughout the route as well from the journey\
  \ and in full blossom during the season. Every tree is been taken care by the caretakers\
  \ from the animals and birds. Residents have small cozy homes with enough space\
  \ in the front and the backyards. The people have a very simple lifestyle perhaps\
  \ due to the fact that they have distanced themselves from the materialistic things\
  \ of the metro cities. Although it has grown tremendously in the past few decades,\
  \ thanks to the tourism the city still has deep roots tied to its culture and heritage.\
  \ You will find souvenir shops in the market from where you can buy the old traditional\
  \ items which people were using years ago. If we go deep into their traditions,\
  \ they have an immense beautiful culture and a unique dressing style, especially\
  \ during weddings. Their folk songs are immensely popular in the region. Each caste\
  \ or community had its typical ornament. The way the bride dresses up with a huge\
  \ nose stud is amazing. I feel proud to visit such a rich natural identity of this\
  \ mesmerizing destination."
