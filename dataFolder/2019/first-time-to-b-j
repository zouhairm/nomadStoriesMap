Text: "Twelve o'clock. Friday. Finally arrived.\nAbout one month had passed since\
  \ I decided to come to the place after an exciting small conversation with a local\
  \ friend in Ramat Gan about my plan for travelling in Israel. Exciting because what\
  \ the friend told me was exactly like what I had read in the books about the people\
  \ in the place definitely included in my travel plan. Kind, generous, hospitable,\
  \ loyal to their homeland and to the country where they are. Really nice people.\n\
  I couldn't wait to travel to the place and see it and meet the people myself. Only\
  \ the courses I was taking in Bar-Ilan kept me weeks away from it.\nIt was Beit\
  \ Jann, one of the legendary places where the legendary Druze reside, near the northern\
  \ border of Israel.\nAnd Shabbat was drawing near. It was only half an hour from\
  \ the time public transportation would \"take a day off\" for the Shabbat when I\
  \ reached the village. I had first to find a place to stay.\nWalking around the\
  \ hilly village for about half an hour, I was led by some local people to a local\
  \ hotel. Nice view and nice decorations. Only it was two hundred and fifty shekels\
  \ for one night. I was considering staying for the whole weekend to experience the\
  \ village. But five hundred or seven and fifty for accommodation was just too much.\
  \ \nI walked around again for a cheaper place to stay.\nAround the corner, a football\
  \ coach merrily mingled with a group of boys on an open pitch drew my attention.\
  \ I enjoyed their football training for a while, and the kids and the coach, after\
  \ saying hello to me, enjoyed looking at me between their running and kicking and\
  \ yelling. When they paused for a rest, I tried to explain my situation and asked\
  \ the coach for help with directions. \nBut English was the same thing to the coach\
  \ as to me: a foreign language. And even more foreign to him at the time. We couldn't\
  \ communicate effectively.\nSo I made a phone call to my local friend, N., who taught\
  \ at Bar Ilan University at the time and who could speak Hebrew, Arabic, English,\
  \ and Chinese. I told him about the problem and he talked with the young coach for\
  \ a while. With the young coach\u2019s \u201CKan. Kan.\u201D to the mic, N. told\
  \ me the coach, A. S., promised to help me find a cheaper place to stay for the\
  \ night. \nThen I just waited there watching the kids practicing with him. \nAfter\
  \ a while, I asked A. S. when he would finish the coaching and took me to the place.\
  \ He told me just wait another while. Another while later I asked him the same question.\
  \ The same answer. He even told me to walk around the village and have some fun\
  \ first. Not worry, he told me. \nSo I just walked around the village, saw a lot\
  \ of housing of the styles I had never seen before and took some pictures. When\
  \ I got back to the football course, A. S. and the boys were still practicing. And\
  \ it was getting dark soon.\nJust after the sunset, the kids dismissed, A. S. and\
  \ I standing at the edge of the football field, there came a car. A handsome young\
  \ man got out. \nHe was A. S.'s brother, E. S. He came to take his brother home.\
  \ \nAnd me. Their home would be the \"hotel\" A. S. was trying to find for me. And\
  \ \u201Cjust take it as your home\u201D was what they told me in the car and what\
  \ Father and Mother S. told me. \nA stranger from China, a comer for the first time\
  \ to the village, with a one-minute brief introduction from a guy on the phone who\
  \ was claimed to be a teacher from Bar Ilan University, I could just \u201Ctake\
  \ it as home\u201D.\nI didn't know what to say. Surprise and happiness and gratefulness\
  \ then was so indescribable. \nFor Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday night and\
  \ all the days in between, I stayed at the S\u2019s. \nAnd it was only the beginning."
