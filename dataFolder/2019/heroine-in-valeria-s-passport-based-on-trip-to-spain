Text: "Years ago, I moved to Ft. Lauderdale, a melting pot of cultures. I was hot\
  \ tubbing at a posh hotel, and a girl in a bright red bikini dipped her toe in.\
  \ Her Latin boyfriend eventually joined us in the jacuzzi. Both were from Spain.\
  \ I took just enough Spanish in high school that I could make out their conversation,\
  \ and the idea for my novel, VALERIA'S PASSPORT was born. I am a freelance writer\
  \ and have written lots of travel content for clients all over the world, so the\
  \ decision to travel to Madrid and Granada, where the bulk of the story would take\
  \ place, was a no brainer. My husband and I had the most amazing time on our Spanish\
  \ adventure; I put tapas and flamenco -- even bull fighting -- into VALERIA'S PASSPORT.\
  \ \n\nI have experience writing brochure copy for offshore excursions on The Royal\
  \ Caribbean. I also ghost write food blogs for my client at Jorj.com, and do local\
  \ reporting for Talk Media, which covers a large swath of Broward County. This part\
  \ of Florida attracts a lot of different cultures, of which Portugal is one. I have\
  \ so many Brazilian friends that I speak a bit of Portuguese.\n\nI hope you pick\
  \ me ;)"
