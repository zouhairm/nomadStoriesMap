Text: "In the hills of Himachal Pradesh we stumble upon a little town of gompas, temples\
  \ and silences.\n\nI could hear a thousand bees buzzing and the occasional chime\
  \ of bells interjected by a clang, as if two super bees had just collided and sent\
  \ a ripple of high frequency waves across the foggy mountain air. The moisture in\
  \ the air absorbed this distinct clamour, and the buzzing continued and became more\
  \ pronounced as I climbed further up. As I trudged a few steps off the serpentine\
  \ road, a small structure emerged as the source of this humming. The human hum now\
  \ took on the distinctive shape of the morning prayers of the nuns in the Buddhist\
  \ monastery there.\n\nJust a turn away from this came another unassuming one-storied\
  \ building. With much curiosity, I interrupted the lama sitting there chanting and\
  \ rotating his handheld prayer wheel, to ask for directions to the caves, only to\
  \ shown into the building. A few steps inside and I felt the sudden drop in temperature\
  \ and the anxiety of an impending stillness. A small inverted V-shaped opening to\
  \ the right made me feel I was just about to enter a new world, like Alice. \n\n\
  A huge statue of Padum or Guru Padmasabhava, as he is known, looked down upon the\
  \ small room created by the walls of the caves and illuminated by many candles and\
  \ a few tube lights. The silence in the air was discontinued only by his looks and\
  \ the pointed goatee beard. The pale gold statue of Rinpoche, in his classic sitting\
  \ pose, had just enough space to be ensconced between the two cave walls. The small\
  \ cave room became the perfect time-capsule for a few passengers who wanted to digress\
  \ from earthly harangues and meditate in this stillness. A sharp ear could hear\
  \ water trickling down the walls in the adjoining smaller cave that housed a small\
  \ idol of Padum\u2019s consort Madarava.\n\nStepping out of the cave, my eyes were\
  \ blinded by the whiteness of the fog and the clouds passing by. I climbed up the\
  \ mountain to Naina Devi temple where there was more human presence. Bhajans could\
  \ be heard clearly while my mind yearned to collect the prasad on my way out. The\
  \ clouds eclipsed the temple towers and the heat from the havan kund was perfect\
  \ for the weather. A newly-wed couple sought blessings from the mountain Goddess\
  \ Bhagwati, an incarnation of Durga, while a few kids busily clicked pictures with\
  \ the clouds as backdrop. The time for arathi made the pilgrims congregate at the\
  \ sanctum while I ran out to get the prasad. After the unassuming fanfare at the\
  \ temple, a government HRTC bus took me back to Rewalsar via a densely fogged road\
  \ lined with pine trees.\n\nI could see the 123 ft statue of Padmasabhava overlooking\
  \ the town of Rewalsar from a hillock while rains continued to wet the green coloured\
  \ lake called Tso Pema, Padmacan or The Lotus Lake. The sun's rays impregnated the\
  \ clouds and struck the statue making it much more lustrous. A hot cup of tea in\
  \ the cafe outside the Nyingmapa Gompa, whichmade a perfect resting place, where\
  \ I could sit and watch the huge statue while letting the monsoon sink into me.\
  \ Reading a book was not an option, as the silence of the staccato was mind-numbing.\
  \ The mind picturised the whole sequence of events of Vajracharya on the burning\
  \ pyre, which instead of consuming him turned into a pool of water and hence the\
  \ water body called Padmacan and the genesis of Guru Padmasambhava, who went on\
  \ to preach Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet from here.\n\nA much-revered destination\
  \ for Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs alike, Rewalsar on the hills had a charm that\
  \ not many pilgrim sites possess. During a quiet walk around the lake, I stopped\
  \ at different places to just look at the huge statue and get into a minor trance.\
  \ It is believed that Rishi Lomas meditated here; and also that there is a Gurudwara\
  \ built by the Raja Joginder Sen of Mandi to commemorate Guru Gobind Singh's visit.\
  \ Having been mentioned as a sanctuary in Sau Sakhi, the town is sacred for Namdhari\
  \ Sikhs as well. Nestled between all these religious sites I found a small zoo that\
  \ housed some ghorals, barking deer, porcupines and bear. The panoramic view from\
  \ the side of the lake, which housed a huge prayer wheel and hundreds of smaller\
  \ prayer wheels (or mane, as they are called) was the perfect culmination point\
  \ after perambulating the lake.\n\nAfter a few days in this quaint little town,\
  \ I rushed back to the madness of the city to immerse myself in some post-travel\
  \ research to find out know more about this uncharted destination."
