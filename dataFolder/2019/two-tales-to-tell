Text: "I have always felt myself to be \u2018extrovertedly-introvert\u2019. While\
  \ I enjoy socialising and going out with friends, I need some good amount of alone\
  \ time to digest the experiences around me and express them for myself. This different\
  \ was no more strongly visible to me than during my trip to Krakow.\nAs I prefer\
  \ to travel slow and melt into the lifestyle of the city, I opted to volunteer for\
  \ a hostel and a party one for that matter this time. The additional benefit this\
  \ approach has is to reduce my travelling expenses.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ was that on this particular travel  & volunteering for a party hostel, because\
  \ of my nature, the two lives that I will live in this historical polish city will\
  \ be so starkly different from each other.\nWhile one of them involved socialising\
  \ with the guests each day as I worked during the hostel parties, and to be honest,\
  \ sometimes I just wanted to sit and watch people do hilarious things when drunk,\
  \ in the other there was no obligation, not even once and yet I was almost always\
  \ on the lookout for a local person to know.\n\nIn the former, which was set in\
  \ a hostel, I saw every night people getting wasted on the cheap polish alcohol\
  \ while they indulged themselves and woke up with heavy hangovers which made me\
  \ think why would anyone choose such a way of vacationing-not the drinking but excessive\
  \ drinking resulting in hangover every morning. The latter which I always observed\
  \ at some cafe, usually a quiet book cafe-without internet, did their work or read\
  \ books in an ancient old setting. \nQuite different from the modern hostel vibe.\
  \ Most of the people there were students taking break from the classes to come and\
  \ do their work, Polish mostly dotted with some Ukrainians while the hostel mostly\
  \ composed of Britishers. If you are familiar with the most common view about them\
  \ among the local community, you will understand why.\nI must say that it is absolutely\
  \ possible that the two sections of people are very much capable of fitting into\
  \ each others roles.\n \n\LFrom what I digested, surprisingly while being behind\
  \ the bar once, that trip had allowed me to experience two lives- two tales that\
  \ I recall from that leap into the unknown.\nIn the historical city known for its\
  \ medieval town and world war scarring, there also existed the modern night life.\n\
  The life I had expected before arriving was where I partied and drank a bit most\
  \ of the nights while I worked in the hostel. The other that I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ but was born out of the need to have my own time happened in a cafe where I read\
  \ and wrote almost everyday more often than expected, talked with many locals and\
  \ even sketched a few."
