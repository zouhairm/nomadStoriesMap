Text: "God is everywhere in India. We were standing in a tiny alleyway in Old Delhi,\
  \ among stacked residential buildings that leant to the side and sometimes didn\u2019\
  t get water, and there they were: Shiva, Ganesh, Buddha and Jesus. Right next to\
  \ one another.\n\u201CDoes anyone know why they\u2019re here?\u201D said our guide.\n\
  I studied the tiles, cemented to the alley wall in a row, each depicting a beautiful\
  \ image of a god or goddess; most religions were covered. We shook our heads.\n\u201C\
  They\u2019re to stop people urinating in the alley,\u201D she said, \u201Cyou\u2019\
  re not going to pee here if you know God is watching.\u201D\nThat word - the \u201C\
  G\u201D word - sat uncomfortably in my mouth, like the wire that bent off the back\
  \ off my front tooth last year. It was sharp, uncomfortable. You don\u2019t talk\
  \ openly about God where I\u2019m from. But here, in India, God is inescapable.\n\
  Our guide, Sachchit, motioned us to follow her. \n\u201CPlease come,\u201D she said\
  \ and continued to lead us through the alleys of Old Delhi. I\u2019d been trying\
  \ to guess her age ever since the tour started. A Delhi native, she looked no more\
  \ than thirteen, so tiny and slender, wearing a small women\u2019s t-shirt that\
  \ practically drowned her. She seemed wise beyond her years, far more articulate,\
  \ sharp and clever than a thirteen-year-old, though.\nWe walked in a single file\
  \ through the dusty alleys, dodged piles of rubbish, honking scooters and hungry\
  \ dogs. She walked quickly, expertly, faster than us. She\u2019d often turn around\
  \ and motion, \u201Cplease come\u201D, before darting off again.\nSachchit was showing\
  \ us Old Delhi as she knew it, as a street kid. She was here on behalf of an organisation\
  \ that educates and homes street children. She\u2019d been there most of her life,\
  \ she\u2019d said, and they had trained her to be a tour guide, to educate travellers\
  \ about the reality of life for her and the others.\n\u201CIf you\u2019re lucky,\
  \ I\u2019ll tell you my story,\u201D she smiled. \nWe had reached the main street,\
  \ this time dodging cars, rickshaws, and strangers. All of us hurrying behind our\
  \ guide, not wanting to get left behind. She would sometimes stop and block rickshaws\
  \ so that we could get past. \n\u201CHey Sachchit, how old are you?\u201D I asked,\
  \ half running to keep up.\n\u201CEighteen,\u201D she said, gently guiding me away\
  \ from the road.\nWe arrived at the next destination, the contact centre for the\
  \ organisation. After scaling the stairs, we crammed in its tiny office, covered\
  \ in old handmade posters about the importance of education and treating each other\
  \ respectfully. You know, classic school stuff. Outside, three boys talked with\
  \ a social worker. One had a bandage on his forehead; blood covered his shirt and\
  \ shoes. All of them were filthy.\n\u201CNow I will tell you my story,\u201D Sachchit\
  \ began, \u201Cwhen I was young, I had a good life, but my father, he was always\
  \ troubled. He began drinking a lot, and then, he began beating my mother. So my\
  \ mother decided to divorce my father, but soon, we could not afford to live. So\
  \ my mother sent my sister and me here.\" \nShe told us of how well she did in school,\
  \ so well she even got a scholarship to a private school. And she was popular, too.\
  \ Good at everything. But she missed her mother, so much, that she started misbehaving.\
  \ Her grades dropped, and soon she was expelled from the school and returned here.\n\
  \"I saw my mother again, and she told me, 'by the grace of God, go back and get\
  \ yourself an education'. And so now I am back here, returning to study, and I hope\
  \ to work in tourism one day.\" She beamed.\nWe applauded her, her spirit and devotion.\
  \ All the while, I thought of the boys outside. Would they be as lucky? \n\u201C\
  What will happen to them?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CThat is up to them,\u201D she said\
  \ giving one a smile from the room, \u201Cand God.\u201D"
