Text: "It is my first time went to Japan, i feel very excited from the time I bought\
  \ the ticket. My friend and I went to travel fair to find a cheap ticket and so\
  \ we got it. Our departure was on November last year, when the time comes I felt\
  \ really really excited because I always love to see where traditional meet modernity.\
  \ We bought biggest luggage size thinking so that we don\u2019t have to carry a\
  \ lot of travel bag, but as you know to get to the MRT in Japan you have to take\
  \ stairs a lot of it whether it is up or down pfiuuhh even though you can use elevator.\
  \ But one day I can\u2019t find elevator and so I need to go downstairs carrying\
  \ big luggage and find difficulties, the height of the luggage is nearly half of\
  \ my height so you can imagine \U0001F601. I didn\u2019t expect someone will help\
  \ me because it was early in the morning and people were rush to go to the office,\
  \ but hey there\u2019s this man asking me if he can help me carry the luggage, oooh\
  \ thank god,  it was like finding an oasis in the middle of deserts. Not only that\
  \ one time we found nice people in Japan, on another day we kinda got confused on\
  \ where do we have too take a bus to some shrine, then we are asking direction to\
  \ this one young man who I assume would like to go to the office riding his bicycle.\
  \ He asked us to wait when he try to find a right direction for us to take a bus,\
  \ we think it\u2019s very sweet of him to go back n forth for helping two strangers.\
  \ Actually I think he got confused too, but he tried really hard finding us the\
  \ right directions. And finally after a few minutes he find where we have to wait\
  \ to take a bus, very grateful for his help but also felt sorry because I might\
  \ be make him come to the office late. While waiting in halte bus, we ask someone\
  \ again which bus do we have to take to go to the shrine, he showed us which bus\
  \ and accompany us until the bus arrives. Based on that experience you will think\
  \ you can find good people everywhere even in the very least you expect . Can\u2019\
  t wait to come to Japan for the second time around, there are a lot of places I\
  \ want to see. Also can\u2019t wait to travel around the world meet local people,\
  \ see and feel the culture last but not least the food. Happy and keep traveling,\
  \ become the citizen of the world. Can\u2019t wait for another adventure"
