Text: "In the month of Ramadhan 2017, where I and muslims around the world do not\
  \ drink nor eat when the sun is out, I caught myself walking for hours in the sunny\
  \ Vienna. It was the joy of the view presented by Vienna that made me able to take\
  \ more and more steps in the heat not remembering that I was fasting. I enjoyed\
  \ walking along in the centre of Vienna, discovering a big plaza after entering\
  \ small alleys, following staircases that brought outstanding views, being invited\
  \ to come closer to a small opening with vines covering buildings only to meet a\
  \ small window where coffee is served. It was the smallest coffee shop I\u2019ve\
  \ ever seen bound by an open window as the shop space. \n\nI continued walking into\
  \ a shadowy part of building under an arch or a gigantic gate, yet it made me wonder\
  \ what comes after. At the place, I find large open spaces bound by majestic building\
  \ with huge Corinthian structures and greeted with human statues at Hofburg Palace\
  \ Complex. Here the scale of place plays fluidly, from intimate spaces to large\
  \ open spaces. \n\nFollowing my curiosity, I then find the shopping arcade filled\
  \ with people enjoying themselves around the Stephenplatz Station. The shops were\
  \ attracting and inviting that adds to the welcoming ambience. Once in a while I\
  \ hear salesman offering a ride on a horse cart, and the other salesman proposing\
  \ a seat in the local concert hall with a special colonial costume and wig. Motorized\
  \ vehicles were limited in the area that made pedestrians walk conveniently along\
  \ the cobblestones. \n\nThen I came to the city garden, where I start to feel thirsty,\
  \ but then being drawn to the blooming colorful roses in Volksgarten, my attention\
  \ was stolen. I closely look at the flowers, noticing their special color and character,\
  \ read their names aloud, and clicked on my digital camera to remind myself of their\
  \ beauty. The flowers were accompanied by statues, temples, chirping birds and the\
  \ sound of flowing water in the fountains. Later I notice a woman walking out of\
  \ the bushes eating ice cream, which again reminded me that I was fasting and told\
  \ myself to call it a day. I once read the book \u201CThe Concise Townscape\u201D\
  \ only to find that Vienna is implementing all the principles of creating the livable\
  \ townscape that focuses on pedestrian friendly paths that offers pleasant view\
  \ and sociable environment."
