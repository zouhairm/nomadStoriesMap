Text: "\u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 my sister said as she slipped off of her pants.\
  \ \u2018Where we are going, you don\u2019t need your clothes.\u2019 She casually\
  \ piled her remaining garments inside the bunkhouse room before tightening the laces\
  \ on her hiking shoes, checking the batteries in her flashlight, and heading towards\
  \ the trailhead. I took her at her word and followed , forgoing clothing for a water\
  \ bottle and sunscreen. We hurried towards the Welcome Center, we needed to be at\
  \ the trailhead an hour before dusk.\n\nWhile the trail is open to the public, it\
  \ is often recommended along with a warning. The trail starts in Valley View Hot\
  \ Springs, which is clothing-optional. Therefore, most of the people on the trail,\
  \ including my sister and I, have opted to be as close as possible can be to nature.\
  \ \n\nWe gather behind the camp host and make our way along the trail. Stretched\
  \ cat-like along the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley, the Sangre de Christo\
  \ mountains head North - South through southern Colorado. As we walk North along\
  \ the ridge, the entire horizon throbs red; there is a reason the range\u2019s name\
  \ means \u2018the blood of Christ\u2019. Everywhere is stained ruddy with traces\
  \ of iron ore. \n\nAfter half an hour of walking brings us to our half-way point.\
  \ The mining town of Orient has been abandoned for almost a century, long enough\
  \ to no longer appears on any maps. The men came here to take the blood-red ore\
  \ from the mountains and all that remains are cracked foundations, rusty scrap metal,\
  \ and large ocher-colored mounds of mining slag. Like all abandoned things, the\
  \ town draws you in only to disappoint with unanswered question. We pause momentarily\
  \ for sips of water before we are driven on by the oppressive heat and marauding\
  \ bands of mosquitoes. \n\nWe branch off of the main trail and head uphill. \u2018\
  Stay on the trail,\u2019 we are warned, the old mine shafts are uncharted, unstable,\
  \ and all around us. \n\nWe smell it first: a cold breeze that would be refreshing\
  \ if it did not smell of decay. The smell grows stronger as the trail levels out\
  \ and then suddenly ends at the edge of a black void in the mountains side. We are\
  \ here. \n\nThis hole in the earth represents just the tip of an iceberg of space\
  \ carved out of the mountain. Part of a large cavern and mining complex that collapsed\
  \ a hundred years ago and opened up the body of the mountain to new visitors. \n\
  \nThe cavern exhales over us as we wait in the growing darkness. It starts first\
  \ as a trickle: a tiny breeze against the side of your face. A small sound evolving\
  \ into a growling rumble until we all look up to see a black torrent spooling away\
  \ from the cavern and into the air. A waterless flood of twisting leathery wings.\
  \ For half an hour, as they fly over, around, and past us: a quarter of a million\
  \ Mexican free-tailed bats flowing out over the flatness of the valley. The only\
  \ sounds the flapping of soft bodies and the edges of squeals mostly too high for\
  \ us to hear. We watch until they slow to a trickle, until they are lost to our\
  \ feeble eyes in the night \n\nWe wait, breathless, until someone switches on a\
  \ flashlight and we silently pick our way back past Orient\u2019s bones and to the\
  \ warmth of the mountains hot springs. Later that night we can see them in the moonlight\
  \ swooping to catch the night-time insects, as we soak under the open sky."
