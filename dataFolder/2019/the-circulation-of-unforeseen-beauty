Text: "The inside of the theater was shaking with musical vibrations and jumbled,\
  \ harmonic chanting, echoing the rain and thunder hitting the streets outside. Local\
  \ post-rock elemental favorite Mamm\xFAt was playing its electrifying set, a must-see\
  \ for travelers and locals alike, as this band has become an influential name in\
  \ Icelandic music. It was Saturday night in busy Reykjavi\xEDk, well into Iceland\
  \ Airwaves 2017, so there were people everywhere, dancing, singing and pleasantly\
  \ colliding. \n\nAfter the show, I went to get my jacket from the free coat check.\
  \ When I had arrived earlier, there was no room to hang it up so I tucked it underneath\
  \ a coat rack on the floor. When I could not find it, I assumed the worst: That\
  \ someone had taken it, as would likely happen in Chicago.\n\nPanic started to creep\
  \ in, and my hands got sweaty. But taking a deep breath, I dug around and took a\
  \ closer look and saw my jacket \u2014 it was hanging on the edge with all the other\
  \ coats. Someone had picked it up from its hiding spot and hung it on the rack!\
  \ Gratitude, generosity and a sense of calm spilled over me like the waterfall Gullfoss\
  \ \u2014 strong, beautiful and peaceful \u2014further bolstering the genuine community\
  \ of Reykjav\xEDk I discovered when I had arrived seven days ago, which I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find in a town of more than 122,000 during one of the most famous music\
  \ festivals in Europe.\nI doubt I would have found my jacket if this were back home.\
  \ It wouldn\u2019t have been like this in any other place. The experience of Airwaves\
  \ and Reykjavi\xEDk was such an arduous yet astonishingly utopian memory \u2014\
  \ utopian because it felt as if we just plopped into this quaint Northern city when\
  \ it was at its best, when the world got to view its vast talent and compassion.\
  \ Encompassed by an excited, open community of locals and artists who treated us\
  \ as their own, writing about music and connecting with Iceland\u2019s nature has\
  \ me teetering in disbelief on the idyllic experience, which even included the most\
  \ unexpected small love story. It wasn\u2019t just a vacation or all business; it\
  \ wasn\u2019t reality, either; that\u2019s the beauty of this short trip I took\
  \ with my college class just before graduating. \n\nThis trip was two years ago,\
  \ but I still smell the sulfur from the thermal pools, feel the music pounding in\
  \ my chest, see the nature landscapes and remember the force of the last night\u2019\
  s storm that magnetized us to the cement walls while walking \u2014 the wind was\
  \ gusting about 40 miles per hour \u2014 impressive, considering I live in Chicago.\
  \ \n\nCovering Iceland Airwaves brought me closer to musicians that still play on\
  \ my music feed. As exhausting as every day was (packed to the brim with work, research,\
  \ interviewing and touristic excursions) we truly got the best of both parts: We\
  \ lived the journalist life during the day, learned the history of the island and\
  \ experienced the tourist side; in the evening \u2014 with the food, the festival\
  \ and the nightlife \u2014 we soaked up the local vibe while reporting on the scene.\
  \ \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to feel so at home, but maybe, on a subconscious level,\
  \ it felt closer to my core. As someone with a European background, stepping foot\
  \ back onto the culture \u2014 even if it\u2019s different compared to my Italian\
  \ motherland \u2014 reignites a part of me that can become dormant living in the\
  \ U.S. I automatically feel at liberty to be myself when traveling, comfortable\
  \ with the community and more empowered to experience multiculturalism because historic\
  \ judgments, attachments and social norms are left on the plane. \n\nLeaving an\
  \ unexpected magical community like Reykjav\xEDk in a short time helped me grow\
  \ and reminds me that stories can be uncovered in the most unassuming places if\
  \ you hang up your coat for a minute and listen. My Iceland trip reinvigorated my\
  \ love for travelling, my worldview perspective of compassion and pushed me to be\
  \ myself and keep lights on the person I was while there \u2014 keep her afloat\
  \ here. Keep her grounded toward her goal of telling stories and cultural narratives\
  \ through writing while learning and teaching the world simultaneously."
