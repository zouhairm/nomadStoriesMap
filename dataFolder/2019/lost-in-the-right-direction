Text: "A back bag, a camera and a note book. This what an adventurous person like\
  \ myself would travel with all the way from Lebanon. In fact, adventurous in a crazy\
  \ sense. This is how my life has been and will always be. Jumping to the road instead\
  \ of waiting for opportunities to come your way makes everything spectacularly outstanding.\
  \ \nTraveling to Portugal, getting to know the different cultures, diving into new\
  \ habits to enhance the beauty of one of the oldest countries in Europe, experiencing\
  \ the original English tea, sharing a beer with a fisherman and perhaps learn more\
  \ about the Pirates code would all be a new experience for the people where I come\
  \ from. Though we might share the same sea, yet the cultural diversity will always\
  \ be a new exciting curious discovery. \nEvery man has a story to tell, every feature\
  \ in the face says one more aspect in human kind\u2019s life. Putting those stories\
  \ in your backpack as you walk by life, trying not to feel your own emptiness, as\
  \ they narrate their lives by your own words, with an international language that\
  \ everyone understands\u2026 EYES!\nAs we spend most of our days trying to draw\
  \ the right path, or even finding the right way, I\u2019ve always preferred to get\
  \ lost. Wouldn\u2019t matter if it was winter or summer, in a village or a city,\
  \ day or night time, young or old\u2026 you will always find billion of stories\
  \ that you\u2019ll be related to in every air particle, with every dot of soil,\
  \ in each drop or water, and with every burnt flame. \nSo, why would anyone write\
  \ about other people\u2019s experiences? Why would I even do it? Don\u2019t I have\
  \ a story of my own to tell? Well, Yes I do. Connecting those billion of stories\
  \ in my every day, will draw my own tale. With every experience to be told, with\
  \ every laugh to be shared and with every opportunity to be recreated would push\
  \ me a little bit further draw the path I choose to walk through. I won\u2019t be\
  \ a stranger anymore, no matter what country I'm in. I will be in every person\u2019\
  s story and they will be in mine, and this would help me in getting lost in the\
  \ right direction!"
