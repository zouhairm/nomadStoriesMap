Text: "There we were in Kep, a coastal town so famed for its blue crabs, that you\
  \ can see a huge one emerging out of the sea holding a 'Welcome To Kep' sign.  We\
  \ had no real plan, but our visas were a healthy 2 weeks away from expiring, so\
  \ Kep felt like our oyster - or crab to be precise.\nThe main thing I noticed about\
  \ Cambodia on our many cramped tuk-tuk and bus journeys, were the views, or lack\
  \ thereof. The never ending horizon of flatness, I'd drift off for a few minutes\
  \ and expect to see a mountain or a hill, or even a slight mound of dirt when I\
  \ opened my eyes.  But barely anything came into my eye line, it all felt quite\
  \ alien after the terrain of Northern Thailand. \nOur first few nights\u2019 accommodation\
  \ was a quaint and basic guesthouse slightly off the beaten track.  The owners were\
  \ away so it was being run by a young French guy (Arthur) and his Cambodian wife.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t actually say what it was like inside, as our bed was a tipi in\
  \ the garden and we bloody loved it.  \nI can't remember who first thought a night\
  \ in the jungle would be a good idea, but we were both equally enamoured by it.\
  \  Although we'd been backpacking for a good 5 months at this point, we hadn't purposefully\
  \ gone out of our comfort zone.  Of course we'd stayed in some disgusting places,\
  \ been chased by wild dogs most nights and eaten food off the floor. But all that\
  \ is well within our comfort zone.\nWe packed our most jungle trek outfits, which\
  \ were scruffy, bizarre and entirely impractical. Off we went, in the blazing heat\
  \ with an army hammock under one arm, a 2 litre bottle of water in the other, and\
  \ rucksacks fit to burst.  \nThe first part of the trek was relatively easy; in\
  \ fact it was a route that we had done a few days earlier just for kicks. As we\
  \ got into unknown territory and our path was being made by a machete, we thought\
  \ we'd try getting to know Arthur a bit better...\n\"How long have you been doing\
  \ these jungle treks?\"\n\"About a year.  Before the guesthouse me and my wife would\
  \ always camp out in the jungle whenever we could.\"\n\"Ah, cool. How many tourists\
  \ have you done it with?\"\n\"Actually you girls are my first!\"\nJo and I looked\
  \ at each other in horror and amusement, but it was too late to change our minds\
  \ now- the path we knew was long gone, and we'd spent 30 dollars on this... if it\
  \ killed us.\nWe started a winding ascent that saw us clambering for branches and\
  \ right on cue Jo's only pair of trousers ripped all the way across her arse. Every\
  \ painfully awkward stride uphill was accompanied by the noise of the hole getting\
  \ bigger and bigger. Until eventually Jo's entire behind was on show, and Arthur\
  \ was beside himself. \nAfter hours of walking, the trek had now become a whole\
  \ different beast. Slippery paths with ripped up tree roots, spiders at every turn,\
  \ and trees that we helpfully nicknamed 'death trees' - with massive thick spikes\
  \ covering the branches.\n\nThe sun had well and truly gone to bed now, and the\
  \ stars offered little illumination. Arthur had the only torch, and was almost out\
  \ of sight. But off we went, blindly following his lead.  We could barely see our\
  \ hands in front of our face, and this was the steepest bit of the whole journey\
  \ yet. No sooner had we managed to scramble over the edge, when I heard Arthur\u2019\
  s uncharacteristically panicked voice\n\"WHAT?!\" \n\u201CIt's a snake - a dangerous\
  \ one\"\nI can safely say that was probably one of only a handful of moments I genuinely\
  \ thought we could die. Jo and I clung to one another while Arthur stood deadly\
  \ still.\n\"Don't move\" he whispered, brandishing his machete.\nLuckily we could\
  \ barely see what happened next, but the night had only just begun."
