Text: "Someday he will appear in my life? The man who will change my tires on a car,\
  \ carry suitcases, take a thousand my photos\u201D, I thought once again putting\
  \ a heavy twenty-kilogram suitcase into the trunk of a rented car, and another seven\
  \ kilogram of hand luggage. Don't think, I'm not worried about my helplessness,\
  \ I am quite an \u201CIndependent Woman\u201D, but I am really tired to being alone.\
  \ With these thoughts  I went to the airport. When I got to the airport, having\
  \ calculated everything in advance, I found that I had come to the wrong terminal.\
  \ It turns out I need to pass the car in one terminal, and my departure, in the\
  \ terminal, which is 20 minutes away. Aware of the fact that I need to first get\
  \ to this terminal, hand over the car and with heavy luggage to come back by some\
  \ kind of a shuttle. Time for all this is clearly not enough, I really started to\
  \ panic. I run out of the terminal to the parking lot, trying to find out from the\
  \ staff how to get to this terminal, in a panic and obviously I'm nervous. Turning\
  \ around I noticed that some \"Hindu\" walks nearby with an embarrassed look and\
  \ tries to make acquaintance. \"Is it really not clear that I am in a hurry?\" I\
  \ hissed and threw a furious glance at him. \u201CGot it!\u201D I run to the car,\
  \ try to make a route, turn my head and see that the \u201CHindu\u201D is already\
  \ at my car and knocking on my window. \u201CNo, well, how can you be so impudent\
  \ !\u201D What do you need, you don\u2019t see that I can't talk to you, ok? \u201D\
  But he stood his ground, \"I see that you need help, I want to help, just listen.\"\
  \ When I heard a very competent English speech, I slowed down and calmed down. His\
  \ speech looked like this: \"Don't  panic, I know what to do, I'm local, I can help\
  \ you, just trust me. \" I was a little wary, but calmed down, and decided to trust\
  \ that is happening. At some point, I noticed that he communicates with me as a\
  \ character from those films when he directs the barrel of a gun to someone, and\
  \ in response he is told: - \"only without panic, put the gun down, we will not\
  \ do anything bad to you. He got into my car and took everything into his own hands.\
  \ \u201CNow we will drive to my car, you will follow me, I know the road and the\
  \ place where we will return your car, then I will put your luggage to my car and\
  \ we will return back, don't  worry, we will have time. \u201COkay,\u201D I said,\
  \ a little embarrassed, because a couple of minutes before that I had been pretty\
  \ rude to him. On the way, he told me that he saw me rushing into the terminal in\
  \ a hurry and there was a panic on my face and for some reason he felt that he wanted\
  \ to follow me and it turned out I really needed help, amazingly! And then I felt\
  \ a long-forgotten state, when I can just relax and let go of control. \u201CReally,\
  \ I  don\u2019t have to worry about anything\u201D I thought. He took my documents,\
  \ reternd my car, checked in my ticket online, even gave me wi-fi so that I would\
  \ not get bored while he was doing all this. Probably God heard my whining today,\
  \ regarding men. Then we proceeded to the necessary terminal, my \u201CSavior\u201D\
  \ surrounded me with the utmost care that evening, and opened the door, gave me\
  \ a hand, treated me to coffee, took care about the  music and the air-conditioning\
  \ . 30 minutes before departure, we resort to the exit counter to the inspection\
  \ area, the inspector scanned my boarding pass: the \u201CPassenger was late\u201D\
  . My friend began to speak something in Arabic, then he ran away, somewhere, I no\
  \ longer believed that I would have time, then he came back and missed me out of\
  \ turn. I ran with all my might and literally flew into the lockable landing door.\
  \  Thanks God, I knew you care about  me!"
