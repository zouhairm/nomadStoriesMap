Text: "Travel, big word , can't describe.\nTraveling is for me a most wonderful thing\
  \ the human been can do .\nCollecting all this beautiful memories, experiences the\
  \ only way can do traveling.\nThe world if people have the chance,  is the most\
  \ unique little ball all we have.\nThinking of traveling , means to discover so\
  \ many different things   like people,  food , nature   culture and thousand things\
  \ more .\nThe best part of the travel , is everything is happening on the way of\
  \ you destiny.\nBecause that way is putting you new things to learn , and when you\
  \ got to your final destiny you are no the same person anymore. \n\nI am a traveler\
  \ who does not want to know this wonderful world, because the only thing that you\
  \ take with you in life or deat are your memories\_.\n\nI visited the most magic\
  \ countries and cities. \nLike Bella Rome Italy , the Beauty of the beaches in cancun\
  \  Mexico or the magic city in water Venice Italy , Winterland in Whistler , espectacular\
  \ sunset in Oia Santorini, wonderful culture in Athens Greece ,The Big Ben London..\n\
  But this world has so much to discover , to learn and to appreciate.\nThat's why\
  \ on going to give my life more reasons to travel , because this world is like a\
  \ book and those who do not travel, have only read one page of that book."
