Text: "It was cool hanging out in a royal city like Madrid, which in its own way was\
  \ like a New York from the eighteenth century, preserved in time. Or, forgive me,\
  \ my European friends, New York was kind of like it. \n\tI went back to the Prado\
  \ a couple of days later to finish looking at the Goyas, because they start to usher\
  \ you out fifteen minutes before the museum closes, opening the cattle gates, driving\
  \ the crowds of cheap-seekers out into the cool Madrid night. \n\tI compared Velasquez\
  \ to El Greco, how Velasquez best embodied the Spanish court\u2019s ideals\u2014\
  in Las Meninas, he holds a mirror up to life and shows himself in it. El Greco prioritized\
  \ his personal ideal over the state\u2019s and was forgotten for two hundred years.\n\
  \tThe Met has one of his two landscapes of Toledo: the city lies under a swirling\
  \ blue green sky and he has rearranged it to fit all of the important buildings\
  \ into his square canvas.\n\tThe other I took a high speed train to see the next\
  \ day. \n\tA lot of people had already given me their perspectives on Toledo. An\
  \ American who offered walking tours from my hostel said, \u201CTry the tourist\
  \ train. It seems like it\u2019s for old people but it offers great vistas.\u201D\
  \ The dude at reception said, \u201CThe escalators are very good. They make it easier\
  \ to climb to the old city.\u201D And a lady from Leon-Castile\u2019s outskirts,\
  \ who I met at breakfast said, \u201CThe gastronomy is very special.\u201D \n\t\
  I avoided their recommendations entirely. \n        I crossed the muddy Tagus where\
  \ a father taught his boy to fish in the mud of the cat-tails. I avoided the Alcantara\
  \ bridge, thronged with tourists, and saw the escalators the reception dude had\
  \ mentioned. I noticed the ruins of a twelfth-century monastery, littered with broken\
  \ beer bottles. A flight of nostalgia seized me; if only I lived here and could\
  \ make the ruins of a twelfth-century monastery my drinking spot. And the city gate,\
  \ with its human-sized Hapsburg crest welcomed me into the Old Town\u2019s cobbled\
  \ warren. \n\tI didn\u2019t feel like paying to go into the cathedral. Sometimes\
  \ you feel like the city is trying to milk you, and sure the church is good, but\
  \ ten euros good?  Instead I sat in the plaza and ate and watched a wedding procession.\
  \ \n\tTwo old guys held the bride\u2019s train. Above floated selfie sticks, phones\
  \ and tables, like modern escutcheons. I cursed myself for choosing to come here\
  \ on a Saturday, the busiest day of the week. I walked into the deserted Jewish\
  \ Quarter, noting the exquisite doors\u2014green lintels, brass rings, blue-and-white\
  \ terra cotta tiles bearing the house numbers, behind which were murmurs of Saturday\
  \ afternoon, cool corners and glasses of rioja, jam\xF3n. \n\tThe El Greco museum,\
  \ a villa with manicured gardens, close to where the master once lived, lay ahead,\
  \ a small crowd already there for the free entry beginning at two o\u2019clock.\
  \ \n\tDown a hall of apostolic portraits was the painting. Three times the width\
  \ of the one in the Met. A spectral figure\u2014Greco\u2019s son?\u2014holds a map\
  \ of the city in the lower right. The hospital, seventeenth-century symbol of modernity,\
  \ rests on a cloud beside a bronze statue. Annunciation fills the sky. No wonder\
  \ El Greco never found acceptance with Phillip II. I stepped back for a better view,\
  \ right onto an old lady\u2019s foot. My apologies were met with a smile. \n\tI\
  \ admired the other paintings and then moved outside. I bought an orange in a bodega\
  \ and followed an alley to a staircase with views of hazy umber hills. The Tagus\
  \ encircled the city like a moat and a swan flapped its wings on the ruins of a\
  \ Visigothic bridge. Olive trees baked in the heat, the scent of rosemary drifted\
  \ in the air, and opposite me, across the river, a climber scaled a hundred foot\
  \ rock face. His friends, miniaturized by the distance, shouted encouragement from\
  \ below. I sat on the second step, shaded by the limestone wall, and wondered to\
  \ what extent this hillside was once sacred, as I enjoyed my own view of Toledo."
