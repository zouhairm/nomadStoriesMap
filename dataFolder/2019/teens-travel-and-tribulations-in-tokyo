Text: "After a few hours tearful and gut wrenching hours in  search of the passports\
  \ ,wisely secreted  in a safe place some days earlier, I found myself plane bound\
  \ to Japan with four teenagers. I passed each teen their bundle of Yen , to be examined\
  \ , exclaimed over and pocketed amid catcalls when I cautioned them not to lose\
  \ their stash of cash .\n\nThat was my second surprise of the trip , with more to\
  \ follow. Japan , so tech savvy and yet very much a cash economy . Each transaction\
  \ met by an eager-eyed \"cashu?\". Cashu? I kind of expected a Japanese word , not\
  \ some bastardised form of English . Pinko another , can you guess ? I digress.\n\
  \nOur taxi driver was our first contact with a local and he evidently appreciated\
  \ our wonder and teen number 4 , expensively educated and purportedly  fluent  in\
  \ Japanese , shyly stepping up to the plate of group expectation and mouthing out\
  \ signage along the freeway to the city .\n\nWe checked in , lobbed our bags in\
  \ to our rooms and stepped out in a general direction . Tides of coated , scarfed\
  \ Japanese all moving swiftly along in almost silence . Even the traffic . Our strident\
  \ Australian voices in united wonder and excitement already attracting downcast\
  \ eyes . A choreograph of two hands and a bow with every 'cashu' transaction and\
  \ with it the feeling for the first time we were here, in Japan and really , really\
  \ , really in a different culture that they kindly forgave us for not yet understanding\
  \ the minutae of .\n\nNow I will answer your question .Why travel with teens , let\
  \ alone four of them . Strategy is the answer . Motivated teens , can navigate to\
  \ any place from anywhere and come up with an itinerary that takes in the whole\
  \ experience . Japan looms large in the teen Zeitgeist. All the more facilitated\
  \ when you have a pretty blonde teen fluent in Japanese ; her efforts to communicate\
  \ greeted by beguiled smiles and wonder . \n\nIn no time I found myself at the teen\
  \ cultural centre of Japan via a subway system with toilet floors I could eat my\
  \ dinner off . Except there is no eating on the move here. Akihabara aka Electric\
  \ Town . A concrete neon city within a city devoted to all things electronica and\
  \ devoid of the narrow , wonky buildings we had remarked upon . While the teens\
  \ excitedly worked their way through their Yen without a ken for  future costs \
  \ , I dangled off a side railing and watched the humanscape flow by me . Pasty young\
  \ men sliding out of doorways , brown paper bags full of Manga porn folded neatly\
  \ under their arm sylphing into the night for their dose of  solo gratification\
  \ . Manicured women pushing pampered pooches in prams . Loud foreigners .\n\nLitter\
  \ . I spied my only litter of the holiday and that too was Japanese to the core\
  \ , the ends of the bag tied neatly into an equal weighted bow. Talking of litter\
  \ we secured tickets to the Sumo wrestling after standing in an orderly and long\
  \ file in the cold dawn . At the end of the day's parading , pagentry and grapples\
  \ a lone finger walked the rows with a large yellow plastic bag . The cleaner .\
  \ When she arrived to our row at the end of her shift I noted the bag was only one\
  \ fifth full . I smiled and used the ancient art of arm waving to indicate the lack\
  \ of litter . She pointed inside and said \"Chinese '.\n\nIt snowed . Great soggy\
  \ blobs slapping down on Tokyo streets . The first time for three years. The heaviest\
  \ in twenty three years our reception reported and Tokyo slowly ground to a halt\
  \ . Not so the teens two of whom had never experienced snow . Much snowball throwing\
  \ and shrieking was had with ever silent side stepping us with downcast eyes . An\
  \ already wonderous city made extra worldly as the snow gathered on manicured trees\
  \ , shrubs and the curved roof tops of the many temples .  We quickly made haste\
  \ to Shibuya Crossing , strike me down I had never heard of the place , so that\
  \ we could could be a few of the one million plus who daily  track across this icon\
  \ but made special by the snow falling ever thicker .\n\nA world within a world\
