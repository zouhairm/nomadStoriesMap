Text: When setting off on my travels I was dubious about what I may find. I had not
  been in a holiday in over 6 years and four hours on a flight seemed long, even though
  it was not. I was astonished at the beautiful sea, the endless mountains and the
  culture. I emerssed myself in Turkish cuisine, plunged myself into a mud bath that
  smelled of rotten eggs, not everyone's cup of tea and searching through the hidden
  wonders of butterfly valley, a bit like the Sahara desert, humid, dry but with a
  waterfall at the end of it that you have to rock climb to get to it. So, what did
  I take away from this trip. The generosity Turkish people have. The landscape is
  beautiful, the caves, waterfalls, lakes and swimming with turtles. How at peace
  you feel even in 50 degree heat. The best time of the year to go is the end of May
  beginning of June. It's still hot but your not burning to death. That it doesn't
  matter how many times I go back to Turkey, there are still places u have not seen
  or visited or excursions I have not been on. If you like adventures and different
  experiences then Turkey is for you. If you like picturesque scenery and prefer a
  layed back holiday then Turkey is still for you!
