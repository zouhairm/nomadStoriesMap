Text: "My grandma mentioned once that my sister and I are incredibly\_different people.\
  \ This wasn\u2019t news, but the way she illustrated our differences struck a chord\
  \ with me. She said if we were to each go on a hike, my sister would be the trailblazer,\
  \ rushing through to the peak, where, upon arrival, she would ask \u201Cwhat\u2019\
  s next?\u201D. I, on the other hand, would take my time, thoroughly excavating each\
  \ staggering path, stopping, literally, to smell the flowers.\n\nBearing this in\
  \ mind, I went on a hike with my dad while we were travelling in Macedonia. Colour-coded\
  \ trail markers with Macedonian text pointed in different directions; we had no\
  \ indication of what lay ahead and chose a path at random. The hike started relatively\
  \ easily but stops for water grew more frequent. At one rest-stop, I found a branch\
  \ that doubled as a walking stick for which my dad teased me.\n\nThe hike continued,\
  \ and the trail markers were becoming less frequent.\_At times\_we doubted whether\
  \ we were still on the right path. The mossy leaf-laden trail - evident of the transitioning\
  \ Autumn and alluding to the oncoming winter - narrowed and became rockier, less\
  \ stable, more steep, more unwelcoming to beginner hikers. Sturdy footing no longer\
  \ a guarantee. Suddenly it was not so stupid to have that walking stick.\n\nWe didn\u2019\
  t know what lay ahead. Breathtaking views of kaleidoscopic Autumn foliage? Folded\
  \ layers of hills converging over a glistening lake? We had no clue. I created a\
  \ small routine to keep my motivation up; I wanted to make sure the journey was\
  \ just as breathtaking as the destination. So I counted 10 steps at a time. I climbed,\
  \ walked, and strode, counting 1, 2, 3\u2026 10. I observed each chalky jagged rock\
  \ underfoot, noticing the thorny branches weaving in and out of my path when suddenly,\
  \ snap!\n\nMy makeshift walking stick snapped clean in half as the space between\
  \ the sloped ground and myself disappeared. For a moment, I saw myself going over\
  \ the mountain. I hit the ground and slid back down the path. The plants underneath\
  \ me were dragged along and found themselves broken under my weight. I slid to a\
  \ stop after desperately grappling at the loose rocks and branches nearby. I looked\
  \ up to find my dad, who - forging ahead as my sister would\u2019ve - decided to\
  \ now stop for his daughter.\n\nI looked down once more before getting up, and suddenly\
  \ a wondrously familiar scent wafted up from the torn greenery below me. It smelled\
  \ like Thanksgiving. It was thyme. I\u2019d never seen it grow wild before, but\
  \ something about finding a familiar piece of home helped me feel some affection\
  \ for the nature that had just betrayed me. Pushing forward, we finally made our\
  \ way to a peak. The cuts and bruises on my arms and knees were long forgotten as\
  \ the sweeping landscape unfolded before us. It wasn\u2019t rugged or grand as some\
  \ wilderness is, but it was wild and pure in a\_humble way. We free-climbed up the\
  \ steepest parts on the way up and slid strategically close to the ground on the\
  \ way down, crushing a certifiable Autumn feast underneath us as we crippled thyme\
  \ coupled with the red- and black-currant berries staining our clothes. All of this\
  \ was made worthwhile with that view.\n\nAt the top, we found an abandoned monastery.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the faded wall fresco. At the graffiti signed\
  \ 1989. At the sheer fact that this holy space was here 700 years ago. After lunch\
  \ and internal speculation, we made our way back down the mountain. I thought about\
  \ the little discoveries that made this trip worth being a story to tell. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to be blown away by rolling hills when I\u2019d seen massive mountains\
  \ elsewhere. I didn\u2019t expect to eat soggy sandwiches with my dad in our own\
  \ little slice of divinity. I didn\u2019t expect to be beaten up by nature and rewarded\
  \ with humble beauty. All I knew was I wanted to tell people about this place. I\
  \ wanted to tell them to take it slow, observe your chosen path with intention,\
  \ and don\u2019t forget to stop and smell the thyme."
