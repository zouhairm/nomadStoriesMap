Text: "Unfinished Journey In Padang-Sumatera Barat, Indonesia.\nIn the 2019, my first\
  \ target is to travel around Europe or at least to visit another country out of\
  \ my hometown Indonesia, such as Malaysia or Singapore. Months passed untill I met\
  \ March and got a travel ticket to Padang city, West Java, Indonesia. This is my\
  \ first trip as a lecturer to go out of the city for working, having a very good\
  \ workshop about torism. So here it is, my journey to Padang city and its beautiful\
  \ things hidden from me.\nMy journey had started when I stood up my food having\
  \ long transit to Minangkabau International Airport Padang, for the first time in\
  \ Kualanamu International Airport, Medan, North Sumatera in Indonesia. The airport\
  \ was impressed me a lot. The facilities and amnities of the airport already got\
  \ a higher standard of the airport in general. The resting area there was my favorite\
  \ spot where I could lay my body down the big soft sofa with a big TV screen in\
  \ front of me. The place is hidden from public walk, therefore it could be on of\
  \ the best places to relax for  long transits.\nAfter waiting for about 6 hours\
  \ and been delayed for an hours, finally I left for Padang. It took an hour and\
  \ half to be arrived in there. My impression there was not really good at first,\
  \ because of the airport really near the sea and it remained me of Tsunami. For\
  \ many years ago, the tsunami happened here and had harashed all the city. It  is\
  \ because of Indonesia located in a ring of fire pacific which makes it easy to\
  \ the attack of earthquake and tsunami. But besides of the reason above, I could\
  \ see an amazing beautiful sea right beside the airport. I could even hear the wave\
  \ when I went out of the door of the plane. I went down the plane from the back\
  \ door down the path to the terminal gate that the view of the sea was seen clearly.\
  \ The weather at that time was quite warm and I started to feel more better than\
  \ my first impresion, then I drove an online car rent to the hotel which is far\
  \ from the airport. \nWhile was taking my way to the airport, I found some luxury\
  \ hotels around. My hotel had got me comfort to live in its room. I could own a\
  \ high quality standard of the room with only 423.700 rupiahs per night. Right after\
  \ felt great of the price I went for the workshop and got a short city tour in the\
  \ afternoon. Unfortunately, I only visited two landmarks of Padang during my journey,\
  \ Air Manis sea and Siti Nurbaya Bridge. These places have their own beauty and\
  \ history which can open up our insights into extraordinary history and culture\
  \ of other places in the world.\nFirst, Air Manis sea. This is the place where a\
  \ legend Malin Kundang live hundreds years ago. He was a bad son to his mother because\
  \ of his mother\u2019s poor condition and old. He married to a rich girl and did\
  \ not admit his mother. Later he was cursed to be a statue with a bow position apologized\
  \ his mother. Malin Kundang statue has been an icon of the city since a long time\
  \ ago. The statue gives great value for the people to learn how to be good to their\
  \ parents and how to treat a mother with heart.\nThe second place of my visiting\
  \  was Siti Nurbaya bridge. The bridge located is on Batang river which connects\
  \ Padang old city and a place named Taman Siti Nurbaya in Padang montains. The name\
  \ Siti Nurbaya was inspired from an old novel with the same name. The place best\
  \ being visited at night or when the sun sets in the evening. The place offers some\
  \ beautiful spots photo with best scenary of the city that cannot be forgotten.\
  \ And actually, there are some more beautiful history places we can visit in Padang,\
  \ Sumatera Barat when we can be off from work and activity to experience the journey\
  \ in detail to enrich our knowledge and information about places around the world."
