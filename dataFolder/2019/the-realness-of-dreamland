Text: "Japan always be my dreamland since I was young. If I described into one word...it\
  \ will be \"Colorfull\". More like rainbow colors and cute pastels.\n It was my\
  \ first ever travelling aboard for me, so many new things I experienced. When I\
  \ get in touched to the local, I learn a lot about their characteristic. They are\
  \ so helpfull when you asking for direction or help, but they actually doing our\
  \ favor with complete poker face, which I was very confuse to react. And when I\
  \ try to show some gratitude to them, they're expression still the same. But I think\
  \ it's better than faking their reaction tho.\nI found it amazing and unique how\
  \ different our cultures are. When my people, Indonesian always be helping with\
  \ smile and all but have know idea about inside their mind, sometimes they have\
  \ hiden agenda or something...well just some of them.\n\nAnother thing that I found\
  \ it really interesting is, their hospitality when you're being their guest. They\
  \ will make sure you are comfortable with everything they prepared for you. And\
  \ they don't really like surprises, I mean everything you should comunicate with\
  \ them clearly and they will make sure everything is under their control. At one\
  \ side you can feel a lil bit stiffness, but at the other hand you learn about how\
  \ to be a more planned person and how to manage life, which is I rarely did in my\
  \ country when everything is full of excuses in life.  Japan still 'Colorfull' in\
  \ my mind, but now the colors added some solid colors, I learned a lot, and feel\
  \ lil bit mature now :)"
