Text: It is said that one travels not to arrive but to travel,I traveled inside Egypt
  about 530 km, to the best place to spend the holiday under a warm sun and wet shadows,It
  is a city that does not see much rain and its temperature is medium and its sun
  is beautiful in summer,I have intended Naama Bay located in the city center,So that
  I can swim and watch Coral reefs and meet new people,Thenwhen I listening to Oriental
  music,I had to turn to Tiran Island,but for what??  In order to see its beautiful
  blue waters at sunset and ride its winding waves.After spending this wonderful day,I
  had to have dinner with friends in a tent in the desert,What is surprising is that
  Naama Bay is a meeting point between the continents of Asia and Africa,The friends
  of the East and the West also gathered in the tent,Then head to the hotel for some
  sleep and not rest so I see you tomorrow in my last day in Sharm el-Sheikh City
  of water and sun. at    6 :AM I woke up AND I have to take a shower now,after that
  i gotta take my nomad breakfast and It consists of a large cup of goat's milk and
  a few dry bread next to a piece of cheese and mountain honey,after that i had to
  go with my friends  To ride camel and race horses in the desert sands of gold and
  we listen to the nomad songs,But the great time goes fast, now we will see some
  sights of the city,The Mosque of Peace was considered the largest mosque in the
  city and then we went to the Church of the Semites in the Al-Nour neighborhood.
  But what looked nice was the visit to the Grand Museum of the City, the Sharm el-Sheikh
  International Museum. The museum houses about 7,000 artifacts dating from the Pharaonic
  era to the modern era.After taking pictures in the museum,Now we have to go to the
  hotel to have dinner and then have a good time at one of the night clubs,It is named
  Mandarin Bar and Cocktail Lounge Sharm el-Sheikh,After drinking shisha and some
  spirits we had to dance a little on the tunes of Arabic music,so we had to go right
  now to our bus, but But our tears come down because we do not want to leave, but
  as it is said, my soul yearns for travel ... unity ... and union with the self is
  not tainted by its passages or interference from anyone.goodbye for next trip.
