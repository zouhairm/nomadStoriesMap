Text: "At last, I was home. Upon my arrival in Beirut, I was greeted with the vastness\
  \ and excitement that roared through the engines of cars roaming the city. The air\
  \ was thick and hot but it felt familiar. It was a Saturday night, and so the city\
  \ that rarely slept did exactly that. In awe of what the country had to offer, I\
  \ witnessed the streets of Lebanon flooded with friends who were overjoyed with\
  \ laughter, tourists filled with curiosity, and lovers gazing at each other in admiration.\
  \ As we drove through Beirut, Jounieh, and Akkar, I was enchanted by the livelihood\
  \ of the country. \n\nThe following day, I was awoken by the loud noises of roosters,\
  \ cows, and mothers yelling at their children. My family and I were staying with\
  \ my uncle in a village near Tripoli where my dad grew up and my whole family lives.\
  \ As I proceeded to go downstairs, I was greeted with cousins, uncles, and aunts\
  \ I have never met. At the time, my Arabic wasn\u2019t strong, and I was too shy\
  \ to even try. Although I understood the language, I had a hard time letting the\
  \ Arabic words flow fluently. Thankfully, my cousin who was 16 at the time, knew\
  \ enough English for us to have a conversation in our native tongues. She would\
  \ speak in Arabic and I would respond in English, and together, we made a mutual\
  \ bond. \n\nShe was strikingly tall, skinny, and mature for her age. Being the eldest\
  \ girl in her family, she was held to high standards: be smart in school, maintain\
  \ your appearance, be nice, feminine, respectful, and obedient. The days without\
  \ wifi we would converse for hours on end; talking about our life goals, school,\
  \ friends, and general interests. On some days, she would invite her school friends\
  \ to meet me (they never met a Canadian before). Despite our 4 year age gap, we\
  \ related to each other. We both understood the struggle and challenges we face\
  \ as women in an Arab community seeking more from life than just marriage. After\
  \ our conversations, I always left feeling inspired by my cousin and her friends.\
  \ They were 16 year old girls from a small village in a small country with dreams\
  \ bigger than anything in this world. Despite their immediate family\u2019s lack\
  \ of wealth and the immense prioritization of marriage, they still remained focused\
  \ on their education and future careers. \n\nBefore coming to Lebanon, I dreaded\
  \ it. My opinion of the people in the country was skewed based on what my cousins\
  \ in Canada would tell me. Initially, I had no desire to make an effort to get to\
  \ know my family in Lebanon. Now, when I think about returning, I get a rush of\
  \ excitement and joy. The girls there touched my soul - and for that, I am eternally\
  \ grateful."
