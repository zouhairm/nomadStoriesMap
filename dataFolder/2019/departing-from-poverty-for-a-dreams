Text: 'My name is okto, I am from the Indonesian archipelago, Rote Ndao, living in
  poverty is my life, but in 2013, my family made a breakthrough and a dream that
  was so great for my life that it allowed me to take nurse of education, struggling
  and struggling so great, borrowing money from people for my education for 4 years,
  finally I was graduated on October 24, 2017 in Kupang, but Indonesian education
  which was quite high in class forced every nurse to continue their education in
  the Nurse profession again for 1 year.

  At that time I thought I would not continue again, but the family borrowed more
  money and allowed me to continue professional education to a distant island, West
  Java Indonesia, on November 2, 2017 I departed from Kupang to Bandung, until Bandung
  started registering and lecturing and in late April 2018, I and my classmates were
  allowed to do training in the Philippines, all dreams that were unimaginable to
  me, Poverty almost captured my dream but the great breakthrough of the family made
  me finally able to set foot in the Philippines .

  I think I am the one who blessed because my classmates have not been abroad like
  me.

  In Philippines, I continued training there for 2 weeks, a lot of life experience
  that I learned there, how to position myself as a foreigner to a country, how to
  respect cultural, religious and racial differences. it helped me so much that when
  I came back to the Rote Island later, in my house''s hut, I could tell them that
  the breakthrough made by the family had made me see the Philippines and not just
  for me but my siblings had to be educated because education can break through and
  can buy an expensive price of "life experience".


  Thank you Philipine on April, 23, 2018 until 6 May 2018, one of my dreams comes
  true, thank you Family, we do that.'
