Text: "In the morning, snow hurries in thick, downy flakes, blanketing Torres del\
  \ Paine. We kill time, lingering over instant coffee, sitting by the fire and hoping\
  \ the weather will clear. \n\nEsperando. The snow lets up and we make a break for\
  \ the trail. Strange geese with black ribboned wings waddle across the matted grasses.\
  \ Startled, they honk and take flight in a flurry of feathers, white and grey and\
  \ a beautiful rusty brown against the stark sapphire backdrop of Lago Peho\xE9.\
  \ Cresting the ridge, a torrent of sleet and snow stunts our progress towards Los\
  \ Cuernos, only the base visible in the furious storm. Guillermo gives me his raincoat.\
  \ \n\nThe sky gathers in swiftly shifting grey rent with clear patches of blue.\
  \ Between peaks, the icy aquamarine of a glacier glows briefly before it is muted\
  \ by the driving snow. The storm exhales, surging as we draw near the mountain.\
  \ \n\nThe storm subsides. Guillermo stops abruptly. Sunlight breaks across the sharp\
  \ incline of Los Cuernos in a perfect angle. A fine mist of snow ebbs and flows\
  \ over the rise of sepia foothills, and under the rinsed sky the pale star illuminates\
  \ with the nocturnal power of moonlight. The mountain is a terrifying, brutal, stubborn\
  \ beauty. Transfixed, I try to hold the shape of light on stone, the texture and\
  \ tenor of the moment. But there is no shelter for memory. Clouds press from the\
  \ south. Once more the flash of mountain and sun are extinguished. \n\nWe cross\
  \ into Valle Franc\xE9s, a lush emerald forest carpeted with dense moss, the trees\
  \ furred with lichen. Ascending, we emerge into the receding storm. Glacier Franc\xE9\
  s, marbled with ice and veined with snow, gleams with frozen fire as if lit from\
  \ within. Turning around, I can see all the way to the distant turquoise lake. The\
  \ clouds pull back like lips over teeth, revealing the grinning spires of Las Torres.\
  \ \n\nWhen we return to the refugio, it is afternoon. The snow has resumed in earnest.\
  \ We linger as long as we dare, but a few hours from sunset we cannot wait any longer.\
  \ Resigned, Flynn and I quickly pack and gear up, waiting outside while the others\
  \ prepare. \n\nI look through the window. Our group is casually organizing, zipping,\
  \ chatting, laughing. \u201CAm I being punked right now?\u201D I ask impatiently,\
  \ looking at Flynn. \u201CWhere is Kushner?\u201D \n\nHe looks at me blankly. \u201C\
  Kushner?\u201D\n\n\u201CWhere is Jared Kushner?\u201D I demand, stamping my foot.\
  \ \n\nHe dissolves, tears squeezed from the corners of his eyes. \u201CYou mean\u201D\
  \ he gasps \u201Cyou mean Ashton Kutcher.\u201D \n\nThe path is quiet and blank,\
  \ like an erasure. Snow is in my eyes. We trail each other closely so we won\u2019\
  t get lost. On the other side of the blizzard, we stop and sip whisky mixed with\
  \ mate. My shins ache. We are raw. Guillermo calls us \u201Ccrudos,\u201D smiling\
  \ hard. Self-assured, fearless, he is in his element.  \n\nNight falls softly, wispy\
  \ threads of light lingering. Smudges, thick like yarn, spool across the park, dyeing\
  \ the murky turquoise of the river, the saffron scrub clinging to marsh. Chartreuse\
  \ anemones merge with ruddy bark, the misty indigo above saturating the bleached\
  \ bone of the pampa. Darkness drapes heavy and woolen over the mountains. They disappear\
  \ behind the veil and are lost to us as we round a bend in the path. In the stillness,\
  \ grass whickers against my leg, rustles in the stiff wind blowing from the Pacific\
  \ and across the glaciers, crunching under my boot in the pitch of the two track,\
  \ deeply rutted and illuminated dimly by the fading flicker of lights as the others\
  \ walk on.\n\nI fiddle with my headlamp, switch it off. Stars form and distill like\
  \ dreams in the black velvet void. The arm of the galaxy extends. I search for the\
  \ Southern Cross, plucking it from a bright cluster in a corner of the Milky Way.\
  \ There is an amplified solitude to the hush and I am gratefully diminished. The\
  \ yawning night draws the mantle of oblivion close, the whispered seduction of mortality\
  \ descending from the obscured mountains. I cannot see them but I feel their presence.\
  \ They are ghosts, like words, like memories, like the past."
