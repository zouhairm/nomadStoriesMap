Text: "Cuba I'm talking to you as a friend when I thank you for the past three weeks\
  \ of travel that have just flown.\n\nCuba I'm talking to you as a friend,like as\
  \ a friend Se\xF1ora Gilda in Trinidad was telling me the story of her life and\
  \ of her country, while on our rocking chairs we where waiting for the hottest hours\
  \ of the day to pass.\nCuba I think about you as a woman, because you've been supportive,\
  \ you allowed me to  discover the pleasure to travel by myself without fears, making\
  \ me feel confident and safe all the time.\n\nCuba I want to describe you with the\
  \ same spontaneity of your nights. The nights that are bringing toghether Santiago's\
  \ people in squares; and the youth of Santa Clara in their colored cultural centers;while\
  \ in La Havana musicians go out on the street to make music.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\
  \t\t\t\t\n\nI've loved Cuba during every moment of my trip.\nI left my heart in\
  \ La Havana,the city that welcomed me to the country on a sunny day, one month ago,\
  \ and that said me a cloudy\u201Csee you later\u201Dlast tuesday before I got on\
  \ the plane to travel back to London.\nI've come to care deeply for the family atmosphere\
  \ of Playa Gir\xF3n, for the neighbours ladies coming every day for a goodnight\
  \ chat on the porch and for the humidity that was drying my hair after the beach\
  \ in heavy wild curls.\nI got a strong dose of good energy from Cienfuegos, thanks\
  \ to the many colors on buildings and on the sky, reflected on the water, at the\
  \ sunset hour.\nI felt at home with the people, with the place, on the four days\
  \ I spent in the beautiful and liberal Trinidad.\nI've met guys with brave, knowledgeable\
  \ souls, during a night that I stayed by chance in Santa Clara; I envy their need\
  \ and will to prove themselves to the world.\n\nI felt a strong sense of loss in\
  \ Santiago.\nThe difference between the oriental part of the island, and the occidental\
  \ one that I'd just left behind, touched me quite hardly, disoriented me, made me\
  \ question the safety I've been experiencing for the whole trip.\nBut I've been\
  \ so lucky in this journey, i met lots of beautiful souls, one of them in Santiago,\
  \ and we connected in a fantastic way.\nWe kept going toghethe, giving each other\
  \ the power needed to believe in doing something that sometimes, for a girl of twenty-two\
  \ years old, can appear to be not as easy as thought.\nThis is how I reached Baracoa,\
  \ the most unexpected wonder of nature: the greenest palm trees, the wildest beaches,\
  \ a great and open wind, the smell of  fresh coconut oil on the skin at the end\
  \ of the day.\n\nBaracoa was the farthest I pushed myself on this trip.\nThe maximum\
  \ I have seen and the maximum I have learned.\n\nCuba you teached me and showed\
  \ me so much about yourselves.\nI saw all your bads, and I'm sorry to tell you that\
  \ I believe are to many.\nThe socialism you fighted a lot for is a wonderful idea\
  \ of sharing and community, though I also believe that today is impossible to live\
  \ in that anachronism.\nPeople of our century have more and more needs every day,\
  \ and by ignoring that you are bringing your people to a sad condition of poverty.\n\
  \nCuba I'm talking as a friend that wants to be clear to you,when I'm telling that\
  \ you are beautiful the way you are and I would like to wish you'll never change,because\
  \ you are rich of everything that we can't buy anymore in our system,but I'm consciouss\
  \ it will change.\nI will tell all my friends to come and see you now, because soon\
  \ you will change, and I wish you all the best, I hope you will be smart enough(and\
  \ I know you are)to take just the necessary from all the cultures that are trying\
  \ to both help and violate you, but please keep doing you."
