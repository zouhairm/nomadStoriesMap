Text: "It was me and two other friends who came up to the idea that we should go hitchhiking.\
  \ This seemed like the best option, considering  the small budget that we had for\
  \ the mountain trip. We didn't know exactly how quick we'll get to Troodos mountains,\
  \ but we knew that there was no coming back from the decision of going on an adventure.\
  \ \n\nAs we were checking the map to see which route was best to choose, our plan\
  \ was slowly taking shape. The clock was ticking so we had to think fast about the\
  \ main concerns that we had. Will the weather be on our side? Is it plausible that\
  \ someone will take us in his car? Where do we sleep when we get there?\n\nAfter\
  \ finding satisfying answers to our questions, we packed a few things and we found\
  \ ourselves on the way to the main road where we wanted to check our luck. \n\n\
  We were volunteering in Lysos, Cyprus since a few weeks so we knew how friendly\
  \ the people are to hitchhiking tourists. I was six months pregnant at that time,\
  \ so our chance of getting picked up by a car was higher than normal anyway, I was\
  \ thinking to myself in order to decrease the little anxiety that I was feeling\
  \ from time to time.\n\nIt was a hot day of august and after we waited on the side\
  \ of the road for a little bit of time, we saw a big truck pulling on the side,\
  \ next to us, as we were holding the paper which had written on it ' Troodos mountains'.\
  \ Full of excitement, we jumped inside the truck and off we went towards our goal.\
  \ \n\nAs it was expected, at some point the truck driver had to drop us on the side\
  \ of the road so that he can drive towards his destination. There we were again,\
  \ going fast under the melting sun, trying to leave the highway as soon as possible.\
  \ This was the craziest thing that I've done while I was pregnant. I was feeling\
  \ how the adrenaline was rushing through my blood and how the endorphins were playing\
  \ with the chemistry of my body.\n\nSoon we left the highway, relieved that we were\
  \ again on a safer road. It didn't take long until the next driver stopped to take\
  \ us on his journey. He drove for an hour and then he dropped us where it was best\
  \ for us to try to find a car which could bring us even closer to our aim. \n\n\
  It was already around lunchtime, the time passed really fast as we followed the\
  \ blurry map that we had in mind. The sun didn't have mercy on us, so trying to\
  \ find some shadow so that we could eat our lunch seemed like a good idea; except\
  \ of the fact that there were mostly small bushes in the area so this time we weren't\
  \ lucky anymore. We ate some bread, cheese and some of the best olives that I ever\
  \ ate and then we left the picnic place. As we were getting closer to the mountains,\
  \ there were not many cars passing by anymore so the chance that someone would stop\
  \ seemed smaller. After we walked for some time in the almost unbearable heat, a\
  \ driver pulled on the side, taking us a few miles under the protection from the\
  \ sun. Like the other few times, the story repeated and the temporary friend that\
  \ we found in the person that took us by car had to reach another destination so\
  \ we were again lined up single file, next to the mountain road.\n\nWe reached Troodos\
  \ mountains before getting dark, so we had a little bit of time left in order to\
  \ explore the surroundings. Going down the pitoresque trail that we found and after\
  \ climbing a bit more on the mountain, a breathtaking panorama view stood in front\
  \ of our eyes. We didn't spend much time there, being aware that we still had an\
  \ important problem to solve back in the village: where we can find a cheap and\
  \ cosy place to sleep after the whole adventure."
