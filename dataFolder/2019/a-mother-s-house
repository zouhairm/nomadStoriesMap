Text: "The fear of being away from home has never been that soft towards me ,and leaving\
  \ my family without all their approval was not so easy. The beautiful scenery of\
  \ Zimbabwe is an attraction to inquisitives like me- aswell as a group of friends\
  \ who have spread the songs of a nation- where in recent years has become increasingly\
  \ unstable. \n\n In the midst of the political chaos of Zimbabwe in 2018, Trish\u2019\
  s joy and enthusiasm keeps my thoughts away from the darkness out there. The last\
  \ night has come to say goodbye to the memorable three days I've been in her residence,\
  \ and she wants to prepare a banquet with all types of food that had been bought\
  \ at the fare earlier- thought to be of my preference and culture. As the preparation\
  \ goes on, I learn my last words in shona with her little child, and other children\
  \ from the house do not delay in joining us in the small room.\n\n Clearly my portuguese\
  \ accent makes the pronunciation of \"Manheru akanak\" (good night) difficult, so\
  \ I step back to try and teach them how to say good night in portuguese. Among other\
  \ words, I couldn\u2019t help but turn my gaze to Trish, who refuses my help in\
  \ preparing the fish on the small mobile stove- that belongs to all the women of\
  \ the house. She has been living in this small room for four years now, and had\
  \ moved to this house of single mothers with a friend when she had her son- running\
  \ away from the confusion of a city in the center to the isolated Chinhoyi.\n\n\
  \ During dinner- with different kinds of meat, delicious vegetables and desserts-\
  \ the kids around the table surrounded it in anticipation to taste food they had\
  \ not experienced every day. My host made it evident, without many words, that this\
  \ was an occasion to do something special. I am impressed by the commitment of this\
  \ optimistic lady in making me feel at home. In the middle of our conversations,\
  \ my admiration grows- for in a country where life expectancy is below 50 years\
  \ old, one would not expect to find women as hopeful as Trish. After dinner she\
  \ takes me to listen to music, and typical dances invade the corridors, as this\
  \ happens at least every week on their entire property.\n\n After risking words\
  \ in the local language, I now risk dancing somehow- which clearly amuses everyone\
  \ watching my obvious clumsiness- but there was always a chance to try again. Casting\
  \ a glance around me I see a neighbor very well adorned with handmade jewelry. I\
  \ approach her to say how incredible her earrings are and in an innocent attempt\
  \ to convey admiration without holding back a big smile, she holds my hand and takes\
  \ me to her room where she presents me with two pairs like hers. I did not know\
  \ how to react to such a beautiful gesture and said that only one pair is enough\
  \ for me. She politely rebukes me and says, \u201C No! You have to take one for\
  \ your mother when you go back home.\" This was only the first gift, other jewelery,\
  \ fabric and dresses filled my suitcase. Every girl who came to me gave me double\
  \ in order that I could share with the women of my family.\n\n The charisma around\
  \ me was so contagious that I could barely settle down to sleep for the last time-\
  \ on the blankets that replaced the bed of the little boy and his mother.  With\
  \ them on my left, my heart could not be more filled with gratitude. Zimbabwe had\
  \ gone from just beautiful sunsets and incredible landscapes to a place like my\
  \ home."
