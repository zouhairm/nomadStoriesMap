Text: "Once I booked myself and ended up traveling to the city of Fes, in Morocco.\
  \ \nI was quite interested in the tanneries and in particular, one of their largest,\
  \ Chouara Tannery. The stories that I heard and read about them, made me want to\
  \ experience it for myself. Maybe something told me I have a stomach stronger than\
  \ the other writers I was researching. \n\nOne rainy morning, I headed out through\
  \ the narrow streets of the (then closed) old market to venture on my adventure\
  \ on foot.  Not a soul was awake at that moment and I found myself lost in the beauty\
  \ of old architecture, the arabic doors, and the thought that these narrow streets\
  \ will soon become a big, chaotic market.\n\nI went past what seemed like an army\
  \ of cats. Armed with Google Maps, very sparse sense of direction and what seemed\
  \ like ages of walk, I ended up in a small alley that opened up into the main entrance\
  \ of the Tanneries. \n\nAs like any other tourist place, I found a guy guarding\
  \ the door with a fake ID card claiming to be the guard to the tanneries and that\
  \ he would let me in for a fee of $100. Having done my research on the tanneries,\
  \ I was well versed with these scams and I did not pay the guy any money. \n\nI\
  \ waited for one of the shops that line the tannery walls to open up. A particular\
  \ shop (shop no.10 - for our convenience) was apparently the best spot to observe\
  \ the tanneries operation from the top. Waiting forever for the shops to open, I\
  \ was being convinced by many English and non English speakers to just pay the guy\
  \ and be done with it so that I can have some close encounters with these massive\
  \ tannery tanks.\n\nThe wait was worth it as the shop no-10 soon opened up and they\
  \ allowed me to enter a balcony overlooking the tanneries. I must admit, if you\
  \ go through the shop, you are slightly prepared for what's waiting for you at the\
  \ end. The smell of processed leather is overpowering but something you are used\
  \ to if you have entered any leather shop. Gradually, the smell starts becoming\
  \ stronger and more pungent as you proceed to the balcony. \n\nSince I ventured\
  \ early morning, I had not had anything to eat. Maybe that's why, I could stay for\
  \ almost an hour in this place. A pan around the tanneries shows a walled enclosure\
  \ with leather shops all around the walls, each with a viewing gallery into the\
  \ tannery. The roofs of most walls have camel hides in various colors being dried\
  \ in the sun.\n\nPlaced in the middle, is a series of stone built cylindrical tanks\
  \ with various liquids filled into them. People with long shoes walking from one\
  \ tank to another and even at times physically going into the tanks. The liquids\
  \ in the tanks vary from a mix of Pigeon poop, and other additives like Pomegranate\
  \ seeds etc. All required to break down camel hides into leather. \n\nThe workers\
  \ put raw camel hides into these tanks (some for a few weeks) and then transfer\
  \ them into other tanks with varying additives till it becomes the leather we know\
  \ and use. What a grueling task that these guys go through each day to bring the\
  \ finest leather goods that Morocco has to offer and exports to the world. No wonder\
  \ leather is expensive. \n\nI had to cut short my exploration of the business and\
  \ pictures that I was taking as the owner of the shop insisted that I buy some leather\
  \ goods from them. I was left with a mixed bag of feelings, having visited a place\
  \ I wanted to visit, surviving the stomach gurgling adventure but feeling helpless\
  \ for the sheer magnitude of cruelty that as humans, we have inflicted on this world\
  \ all in the name of a classy leather belt ...."
