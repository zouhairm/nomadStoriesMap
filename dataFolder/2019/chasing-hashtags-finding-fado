Text: "I hugged my jacket tighter as the spring wind from the sea hit me- fresh, cool.\
  \ It foretold of something new, something unexpected.\n\nI didn't know much about\
  \ Portugal. It was a last minute decision spurred by my husband's sudden job change-\
  \ one which left him with invaluable calendar space and a passport that had collected\
  \ far too much dust. \n\n\"How about Portugal?\" I asked.\n \nSecretly, it was a\
  \ single Instagram photo that sparked my interest: an image of a woman laughing\
  \ in front of a tiled Lisbon storefront. The caption: #Wanderlust. \n\nI wanted\
  \ that photo, too. I wanted to laugh in beautiful, exotic places. I wanted another\
  \ checkmark on my world travel bucket list, a destination (with photographic evidence,\
  \ of course) to add to my collection. \n\nHe offered a 'why not' shrug, and it was\
  \ decided: Portugal was the place. \n \nA series of sharp turns and steep ascents\
  \ up narrow streets brought us to our Lisbon apartment.\nDropping our bags, we rushed\
  \ to the rooftop to catch the sunset. The sea sparkled and the 'Christ the King'\
  \ statue stood sunlit, arms spread like a welcome to us: a benediction. Below us,\
  \ the city sprawled in pastel pinks and vibrant yellows, buzzing with life. Faint\
  \ music and the smell of seafood drifted from a restaurant down the street. There\
  \ was an intangible quality to the city, one I couldn't quite put a finger on. All\
  \ I knew was I wanted to be a part of it.\n \nWe spent a day just outside Lisbon,\
  \ exploring the whimsical architecture of the Pal\xE1cio da Pena and the Quinta\
  \ da Regaleira, whose twisting corridors and secret passages left me feeling like\
  \ I just stepped out of a fairytale. \nIn the evening, we gorged ourselves on Pastel\
  \ de Nata- the decadent custard tart dusted in cinnamon- and dreamed of possibilities...what\
  \ if we just stayed?\n \nOur last day in Lisbon, we hopped a ride on one of the\
  \ city's cable cars. We spotted a small cafe along the tracks, where we later sat\
  \ sipping espresso until a rain cloud drove us indoors. The bar was cozy, and the\
  \ bartender with a booming laugh insisted I try the Licor Beir\xE3o while we waited\
  \ out the rain. He poured me the sweet-tasting topaz liqueur over ice, then promptly\
  \ another when I finished. \nWe chatted about the Portuguese graffiti artist, Vihls,\
  \ and the complicated history of cod fishing in their rich coastal waters. \nThe\
  \ Sun beckoned, and as we said our farewells, the bartender invited us to join him\
  \ for live Fado music later that evening. My husband and I again looked at each\
  \ other with the 'why not' shrug and agreed to meet him at sunset.\n \nWe sat in\
  \ the dimly lit room with our new friend and waited. A musician strummed a Portuguese\
  \ guitar, and a lone vocalist stepped into the spotlight. She began to sing. \n\
  \ \nFeeling poured from every note. The words were Portuguese, but somehow I understood.\
  \ Emotions I felt when I saw the laughing Instagram woman flooded to my mind: Longing.\
  \ Desire. Freedom. Joy.  \n\nAs she sang, I realized it was this expression of emotion\
  \ that was the intangible quality I couldn't describe before. Emotion was hidden\
  \ in the details of Portugal; in the tiles arranged by hand and the cobblestones\
  \ underfoot; in the richness and pride of the cuisine; in the childlike optimism\
  \ of the architecture; in the freedom of the art; in the warmth of the smiles; and\
  \ now in the raw expression of the music- the very soul of Portugal bared for all\
  \ to see. \n \nOur friend told us that in Portuguese, they have a word for Fado\
  \ music: Saudade. \nIn English, it roughly means 'intense longing'. I feel this\
  \ Saudade now for Portugal. The people shared a piece of their heart with me, and\
  \ in return, I left a piece of my heart there with them, too. \n \nIn the end, I\
  \ got my tile storefront #Wanderlust photo, but so much more than that. I never\
  \ expected that I would find a place where my soul felt home, a place I didn't know\
  \ I had been missing...and that's not something you can capture in a photograph."
