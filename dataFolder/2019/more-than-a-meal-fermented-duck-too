Text: "Driving through narrow winding streets, the odd chicken dodging across our\
  \ path, I arrived at my homestay in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. The family I was\
  \ staying with were clearly much wealthier than the surrounding neighbours, with\
  \ a large property that could cater large groups, and a big refrigerator! My homestay\
  \ mom was short and a bit cuddly (reminding me of my mom), and couldn\u2019t speak\
  \ English. My guide was a young woman, who spoke amazing English and was supporting\
  \ herself through university by being a tour guide. I didn\u2019t meet the husband\
  \ and sons, as, typical in many regions, they left the hosting to the female of\
  \ the house.\nAs I was the only person staying, the host mom asked through my guide\
  \ and interpreter, whether she could cook some local food, in addition to the tourist\
  \ food. Eager to try everything, weird and wonderful, and knowing that she really\
  \ wanted to share real Vietnamese food with a willing tourist, I said yes. \nI helped\
  \ prepare the dinner, but mostly watched as my host mom worked like a well-oiled\
  \ machine, never checking a recipe (I\u2019ve always wanted that skill). In an impossibly\
  \ short time a huge feast was presented on the table, and we sat down together,\
  \ wondering how this would work. \nOver fermented delicacies (duck, shrimp and pork),\
  \ and the more palatable \u2018tourist food\u2019 (beef ribs and chicken) we shared\
  \ more than a meal, discussing our hopes for the future. \nDespite the language\
  \ barrier, my guide translated seamlessly, allowing us to have a personal conversation.\
  \ My fears about stumbling through an awkward dinner were gone.  I learnt about\
  \ my host family, their life and my host mom\u2019s role running a successful homestay\
  \ business (uncommon for a female in rural communities). I shared my family with\
  \ her, and told her about my brother living in America (I was living in Australia)\
  \ who I only see every two years. She was amazed at how far my family was spread\
  \ (with my Dad also coming from England), and how one day she hoped she would be\
  \ able to take her family on a holiday to neighbouring Thailand, but that it was\
  \ so expensive. This struck me, I have been to Thailand several times before, it\
  \ is considered the cheap tropical holiday common for many young Australians, who\
  \ take for granted their wealth in being able to afford last minute plane tickets\
  \ and abundant massages.\nAlthough the only things we had in common were our love\
  \ of food and our gender, the connection between the three of us was further strengthened\
  \ as we spoke about an event that occurred earlier that day. On a walk around the\
  \ neighbourhood, a man asked in Vietnamese where my husband or boyfriend was. When\
  \ this was translated to me I just laughed and shrugged. Familiar with this sentiment\
  \ after a month travelling through Vietnam alone, I was unsurprised and only a little\
  \ annoyed. \nMy guide, who was clearly working hard to achieve her goals, shared\
  \ her frustrations about family and societal pressures to get married. She wasn\u2019\
  t single, she had a long-term boyfriend, but she wasn\u2019t sure whether she wanted\
  \ to marry him. Her family would joke about why she wasn\u2019t married yet, and\
  \ pressure her to get married because she was too old to be single (she was 22).\
  \ \nMy guide\u2019s deepest desire was to have the support of her family in obtaining\
  \ an education and having a career. \nMy host mom\u2019s deepest desire was to take\
  \ her family on a holiday, and allow her children the freedom and opportunity to\
  \ travel and work overseas. \nMy desire was for my family to be together.  \nRegardless\
  \ of how different our lives were, we had the same connection to family and identity."
