Text: "As our bus rolled down the street I gazed through the window at the countryside.\
  \ The beauty of palm trees and mountains in the distance was offset by the images\
  \ in the foreground. Worn down houses lined both sides of the road. Trash littered\
  \ the space where one might expect to see a sidewalk. A plume of dark smoke billowed\
  \ from a pit where someone burned \u201Ccharbon,\u201D a crude source of energy\
  \ made by covering wood with dirt.\n I remembered Dr. Washington\u2019s description\
  \ of Haiti: \u201Cthe poorest country in the Western hemisphere.\u201D He and the\
  \ other professors had tried to prepare me and the fourteen other students for our\
  \ trip. We had been selected to travel to Haiti for Spring Break where we would\
  \ be both tourists and volunteers. The hope was that we would come to appreciate\
  \ the beauty the country offered but also be prepared for the ways such poverty\
  \ manifested itself. \nThe bus continued towards Croix-des-Bouquets, a city a few\
  \ miles east of Port-au-Prince. When it finally stopped, we were parked on a dirt\
  \ road in front of an open-air compound that looked more like a fortress than a\
  \ school. It had large walls that completely surrounded the building and a thick\
  \ gated entrance. When opened, however, the gates revealed something much more hospitable.\n\
  I saw children kicking an old ball around the courtyard, and a few older women sat\
  \ listening to music. Behind them stood a two story building with a kitchen and\
  \ clinic on the lower level. Bedrooms and office space were upstairs. On the other\
  \ side of the courtyard was a row of classrooms now empty after a full day of school.\
  \ We met in those classes early the following morning for our first activity \u2013\
  \ leading a workshop on reproductive health.\nWhen it was time to begin, we split\
  \ into two groups. The women received a group of girls to work with, and the men\
  \ were sent a group of boys. The lesson went smoothly besides some stifled laughter\
  \ from the younger boys in the group, but what was more eventful was the period\
  \ after class. After the lesson, we had a chance to speak freely with the student.\
  \ I found a boy who sat alone in the back of the class. He struggled with English\
  \ and was having difficulties conversing with my colleagues. \nI had spent a previous\
  \ semester studying in Paris and picked up some French while I was there. I plopped\
  \ down beside him and said, \u201CBonjour!\u201D His face lit up and he responded\
  \ with an incredulous \u201CVous parlez fran\xE7ais?\u201D We went on to talk for\
  \ an hour. He told me his name was Emmanuel and that he was fascinated by American\
  \ culture. He asked me about life in the United States \u2013 whether this movie\
  \ was realistic or that event really happened. He listed his own favorite American\
  \ rappers singers complete with detailed explanations.\nI was touched by Emmanuel\u2019\
  s eagerness and attempted to respond in kind. I told him about the delicious Haitian\
  \ food that I had tasted and about how I loved the scenery. Then I began rattling\
  \ off what I knew about the country\u2019s history. I mentioned the name of someone\
  \ who led the Haitian revolution, and Emmanuel became overjoyed that someone from\
  \ the United States knew so much about his little country. His voice then grew low\
  \ as he explained that he had American friends who vowed that they would never set\
  \ foot in Haiti. \nEmmanuel paused then asked, \u201CWhy don\u2019t people like\
  \ our country?\u201D  I was blind-sided by the question and rambled something about\
  \ ignorance. A few moments passed then he nodded his head before saying, \u201C\
  I think the most beautiful thing about Haiti is the people.\u201D I smiled in agreement.\
  \ We continued talking until the professors shuffled us off to our next activity,\
  \ but I kept thinking about our conversation.\n  During the rest of my time in the\
  \ country, I saw more signs of poverty and what lengths people went through to enjoy\
  \ simple pleasures. However, I also noticed that, despite their circumstances, people\
  \ continued to smile."
