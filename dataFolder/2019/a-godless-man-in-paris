Text: "Paris, je t\u2019aime. It\u2019s a classic. With millions visiting the city\
  \ of lights every year, it\u2019s bound to be. As you\u2019ve probably guessed,\
  \ I am one of those people, enchanted by its beauty, or the image of it to be exact.\
  \ Up until then, Paris had been anything but a picture of Tour Eiffel on my bedroom\
  \ wall. It was an act of faith, I guess. That the universe will one day realize\
  \ my lifelong dream. I was going through a challenging time. The business I had\
  \ built for about a decade had to be closed down, despite all my attempts to keep\
  \ it afloat. It was devastating. Surely, I was not the same man who taped that picture\
  \ on the wall years ago. At the time, being faithful felt like an impossible concept.\n\
  \ \nOne day, a former colleague from the office days called and informed me that\
  \ our company had decided to grant me the pension fund which was inaccessible before.\
  \ I was in disbelief. \u201CHas the universe finally spoken to me?\u201D And when\
  \ a lady from the HR division called to confirm the good news, I was ecstatic. It\
  \ wasn\u2019t long before a question popped up. \u201CWhat would I do with the fund?\u201D\
  \ Travelling appeared uncontested. Next question, \u201CWhere to?\u201D I was lost\
  \ in thoughts about possible destinations. And it was when I once again saw that\
  \ neglected and dusty picture of the iconic tower, that it all became clear.\n\n\
  It was a cold morning when I finally set foot in Charles de Gaulle Airport, late\
  \ September that year. Especially for someone who had been living in the tropics\
  \ all his life. I hurriedly took the train to the city so I could quickly experience\
  \ Paris. Time is of the essence! I had to walk for a little bit from the station\
  \ before I reached my hostel. My first thought was just to drop my backpack and\
  \ go explore straight away. But the administration work at the reception took longer\
  \ than I had anticipated. But it was right there and then that I met Mr. Dee for\
  \ the first time. And as if it was planned, we ended up being roommate! He was friendly\
  \ but we didn\u2019t talk much because the second I got my room key, I was out of\
  \ there. When I got back to the hostel, he was not in the room.  Exhausted, I decided\
  \ to take a quick bath and sleep.  \n\nThe next day, Mr. Dee asked if he could join\
  \ me exploring the city. Which was fine by me. Past breakfast, we decided to visit\
  \ The Louvre. We got along very well and talk about a lot of things. I found out\
  \ that he was originally from India and was working as a doctor in London. He shared\
  \ about his family, about his younger sister and parents who are still living in\
  \ India. Our similar Asian background definitely had something to do with our immediate\
  \ bond. It was during our visit to Notre-Dame that I found out about a quite surprising\
  \ side of him. He told me he is a non-believer. Where I\u2019m from, people are\
  \ very judgmental about atheists. But I\u2019m all about respecting differences\
  \ and tolerance. And I could see that it is the same for him when he bought the\
  \ rosary beads for his sister, who he said is a devoted Catholic. His parents are\
  \ very religious and still practice Hinduism.      \n\nFrom there we decided to\
  \ go for a walk down the bank of Seine. Reflecting my own situation, I was curious\
  \ about how he got through difficult times. To him, it was all about self-reliance.\
  \ Constructive self-talk was his ammunition. It was then I realized that it actually\
  \ took quite a personal strength and character to be an atheist. We parted ways\
  \ in the late afternoon as he was going to meet up with a friend living in the city.\
  \ My encounter with Mr. Dee, albeit brief, left quite an impression in me. My days\
  \ of being a temporary Parisian would be over soon. And the perspective I got from\
  \ my conversation with a godless man would be useful in my own journey. Perhaps."
