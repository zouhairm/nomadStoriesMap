Text: "You don't expect to find yourself on the outskirts of Brussels, surrounded\
  \ by derelict warehouses and unmarked offices. The warehouses are grimy, the windows\
  \ are broken and the doors are bolted shut. The graffiti is angry scrawl, nihilistic,\
  \ dispossessed - so different to Belgium\u2019s bright murals. \n\nWith your bare\
  \ shoulders resting against the concrete walls of an office building, you wait in\
  \ the shade. Suddenly, the still air is filled with the long wail of a violin. It\
  \ comes from the warehouse you are facing. You start \u2013 what? What was that?\
  \ And then it surges forward, like a tsunami: the crashing, roaring, opulent sounds\
  \ of a symphony orchestra. The instruments strain and soar, lift and smash, like\
  \ an outraged chef. \n\nYou gape at this moment, you stare up at the sky, you look\
  \ around for a witness. A man steps out of the cabin of his truck and walks over\
  \ towards you, his mouth slightly open. He is staring intently at the same warehouse\
  \ \u2013 about the size of an airport hangar, painted a dusty orange. He speaks\
  \ to you without making eye contact.\n\nWhat is this? It is not \u2013 this is not\
  \ what I expect, here? In this place? Do you know?\nYou shake your head.\nYou are\
  \ not with them, with the music?\nNo. I am waiting for a friend.\n\nThe truck driver\
  \ does not comment that this is a strange place for a young foreigner to be waiting\
  \ for a friend. He continues to listen intently, closing his eyes for a moment.\
  \ The rehearsal continues for another seven minutes, and at the end he rolls a cigarette.\
  \ \n\nSuperb, he grimaces. Some deconstructed Bach, eh?\n\nYou do not tell him you\
  \ can\u2019t tell Bach from Beethoven. You watch him slope towards his truck and\
  \ drive off. Your friend appears from the building behind you. You try to tell him\
  \ about it \u2013 there was this music, you say, like a film...\n\nBut your friend,\
  \ S\xE1ndor, is distracted. \n\nI apologise, he says formally. I should not have\
  \ brought you here. My boss did not like it.\n\nS\xE1ndor is tall and broad like\
  \ a heavy, wooden bookcase. There is a timelessness about him that is comforting.\
  \ He wears an analogue watch and a blazer. His belt matches his shoes. When you\
  \ met, he was drinking black coffee and reading a newspaper. You were the last two\
  \ people at the hostel breakfast. He is Hungarian, in town on business.  The only\
  \ Hungarian film I have ever seen ends with a shot of a rotting cow carcass, you\
  \ tell him. He smiles at you. Yes, he says. They all end like that.\n\nS\xE1ndor\
  \ does not wear t-shirts with slogans on them, or baseball caps. He speaks four\
  \ languages. He is not backpacking through Europe to find himself. He answers your\
  \ interrogations about his purpose in Brussels politely, but the details are gently\
  \ obscured. What is he waiting for? A call about a car. Where does the car come\
  \ from? They come from Hungary. Where do they go? They go to Paris. How, why? I\
  \ drive them, I drive one, others drive others, they are for the Romanians. There\
  \ are Romanians in Paris who want cars \u2013 they want cars and I drive them, that\
  \ is my job. \n\nWhat more can you ask?\n\nThe train you take to collect the car\
  \ together is old, with leather seats. S\xE1ndor sits opposite you, smiling at your\
  \ happiness as the dappled forests rush by. He wants you to drive to Paris with\
  \ him, and for a moment you consider it. This is the least lonely you have felt\
  \ in years. \n\nBut then there is the business meeting. His boss, and sharp way\
  \ he looks at you. The interrogation, the veiled threat. Your polite exit. And then\
  \ the music. The music you cannot tell S\xE1ndor about.\n\nAfter he apologises,\
  \ you stand together watching the trucks driving in and out of the parking lot,\
  \ the weary warehouses silent again.\n\nYou will not come with me, in the car I\
  \ must drive, to Paris, he states.\nThat is correct, you reply.\nHe stares at his\
  \ large, strong hands.\nCome, he says. We must buy your train ticket back to the\
  \ city."
