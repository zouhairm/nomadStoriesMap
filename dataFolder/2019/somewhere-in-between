Text: "I\u2019d always thought of Turkey as a country filled with millennium-old mosques\
  \ and spices that have flavored food for generations. \n     Living in Berlin, I\
  \ came into daily contact with Turkish people and Turkish culture. I fell for their\
  \ stout, sweet coffee made in small silver pots and their meze plates crowded with\
  \ warm falafel rounds sparkling with yogurt and pomegranate seeds. \n     The cuisine\
  \ piqued my curiosity first. It was only a matter of time before I traveled there.\n\
  \     One summer, Ellie, a friend of my sister\u2019s, came to visit Berlin. Ellie\
  \ lived in Istanbul and offered to host me. \n     It was my first time in the Middle\
  \ East. When I arrived, the sun was halfway to setting. There the golden hour is\
  \ lilac, pink, and orange-red, making for a sky that's at once both soft and loud,\
  \ wild and composed, a flurry of contrasts.  \n     Why would anyone ever leave\
  \ here? I thought as I waited for a bus outside the airport. \n     Ellie told me\
  \ half of Istanbul lies in Europe, the other half in Asia. Planted in limbo between\
  \ west and east, the city has a split personality and thus, always surprises you.\
  \ Even the waterway that divides the city is neither river nor sea: It\u2019s a\
  \ strait called the Bosphorous. \n     Much of the food is similarly in disguise,\
  \ revealing itself upon taste to be milder or stronger in flavor than you imagine\
  \ it being. Ellie introduced me to a crumbly white cheese called beyaz peynir. It\
  \ looks like feta but is creamier, less salty, and impossible to stop pushing hunks\
  \ of crusty bread into. The baba ghanoush is often so smoky, the cooked down eggplant\
  \ tastes like cigarettes. It's rich in flavor and unsurprisingly addictive. Raki,\
  \ a bracing, licorice-flavored alcoholic drink, is sometimes cut with sugary beet\
  \ juice. \n     Ellie and I drank the violet colored drink while sitting on a patio\
  \ overlooking the Bosphorus and listening to the dulcet strumming of a long-necked\
  \ Turkish baglama. The locals we were with kept reminding me, \u201CRaki gets the\
  \ people talking.\u201D \n     It was the middle of Ramadan. I was surprised at\
  \ how relaxed everyone was during a month of fasting, as well as at how so few restaurants\
  \ were closed. Religion is thickly woven into the fabric of the city. Each day the\
  \ Islamic calls to prayer sweep over Istanbul's many hills. They wake me up in the\
  \ early hours of the morning. I couldn't comprehend a word, but the effect was hypnotic.\
  \ \n     So are the paintings of Fahrelnissa Zeid, a 20th century artist I discovered\
  \ at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Istanbul. As eccentric and lively as her\
  \ country, Zeid was a princess who painted portraits of the wealthy aristocrats\
  \ and politicians she knew. In each, the subject\u2019s black eyes loom larger than\
  \ the rest of their face.\n     They\u2019re the artist's eyes. \n     Just as striking\
  \ are her paintings without people in them: Saturated colors edged in black and\
  \ made into angular shapes covering wall-sized canvases are unlike anything I've\
  \ ever seen. \n     Hagia Sophia is breathtaking on the inside, and the Spice Bazaar's\
  \ cardamom and saffron are more fragrant than flowers. \n     Now when I think about\
  \ Istanbul, I see more than mosques and spices. I see a fiery sunset and abstract\
  \ paintings. I see an hours long dinner by the Bosphorous. I hear the call to prayer.\
  \ \n     All of these are Istanbul. It's not Asia. It's not Europe. It's somewhere\
  \ in between, and it's never what you expect."
