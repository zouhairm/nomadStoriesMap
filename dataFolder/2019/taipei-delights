Text: "Taipei has been a pleasant surprise.  For my school vacation, I went to Taipei\
  \ with a friend from work.  We arrived on a Saturday evening and easily made our\
  \ way from the airport to our hotel.  Neither of us had really prepared much for\
  \ the trip, just sort of trusted our instincts that we would find everything we\
  \ would need.  I did research how to get from the airport into the city, but that\
  \ was about it.  \n\nThe first thing I noticed in Taipei was the heat and the humidity.\
  \  Taiwan is hot.  It's Bangkok hot.  Coming from a cool September in the USA, it\
  \ was surprising to be slapped in the face with such heat.  The hotel we chose was\
  \ in a great location called Ximen.  Ximen is one of the gay areas of Taipei  (pronounced\
  \ She Men).  It's popular with a younger crowd because of all the shopping, casual\
  \ restaurants, and bars.\n\nAfter getting settled, we headed to the The Red House.\
  \ The Red House is over 100 years old and started out as a market place back during\
  \ the Japanese colonization of Taipei.  It then became a movie theater and a performing\
  \ arts center.  In the 1990s it fell into disrepair and was abandoned until a cultural\
  \ arts center decided to save and renovate it in 2002. Today, it's the center of\
  \ the gay neighborhood.  It's surrounded by gay bars, clothing stores, and restaurants.\
  \  On the weekend, the plaza behind the building is filled with outside seating\
  \ and men.  Rainbow flags fly everywhere.  \n\nThe Taiwanese are incredibly friendly\
  \ people, and the city is very easy to navigate.  English is spoken much more readily\
  \ making it far better for communication than Seoul. Within hours of arrival, I\
  \ was sitting outside enjoying a drink when someone I met online joined me.  He\
  \ brought a friend, who in turn brought a friend.  Soon there were five of us enjoying\
  \ drinks on the warm and humid night.  After drinks the gents took us on a short\
  \ tour of Ximen, but it was pretty late at this point, and not much was open.  \n\
  \nOn Sunday, we went out to dinner with the guys we met the night before.  They\
  \ took us to a great local restaurant and we just let them order what they wanted.\
  \  The food in Taipei is delicious.  It's much more simple yet flavorful than Korean\
  \ food.  They love their ramen of course, as well as dumplings, fried rice, grilled\
  \ meats, stinky tofu, bubble tea, and fruit teas.  Unbeknownst to us, this was a\
  \ holiday weekend. Monday was a lunar holiday (as in Korea) but they celebrate the\
  \ moon festival by eating moon cakes.  Since Monday was a holiday, many people were\
  \ out Sunday night.  I joined the three guys for a drink after dinner and then we\
  \ went to an organized dance party, or circuit party.  The club was beautiful, with\
  \ amazing lasers, strobe lighting, and music.  We arrived about 11:30 and danced\
  \ for a couple of hours.  By 2:30 I was ready for bed so I said goodbye and made\
  \ my way back to the hotel.\n\nOn Tuesday we ventured out of the city on a bus and\
  \ went to the see these geological rock formations at a beach north of Taipei. \
  \ The bus ride was over an hour, and then we had to walk about 20 minutes to get\
  \ to the beach, but it was worth it.  Apparently the tide over the years had worn\
  \ away the sandstone to create these otherworldly sculptures that looked like giant\
  \ mushrooms.  You're able to walk among them as they tower above your head. It feels\
  \ as if you're walking on Mars. One is shaped like the head of the Egyptian queen\
  \ Nefertiti and is called The Queen's Head.  It's actually not the most impressive\
  \ sculpture there.\n\nTaipei is a city  filled exciting night markets, great shopping,\
  \ beautiful hiking trails, organized subways, and wonderful people and food.  It's\
  \ a jewel of city in Asia and one I look forward to visiting again."
