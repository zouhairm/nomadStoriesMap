Text: "The world is not innocent.  It has always fought me and I never succeed in\
  \ changing it to the better. This period was in the north where I was born and where\
  \ my family still lives. \nNow I moved to the south. I could not afford any more\
  \ and left -always same person very peacefully and without causing troubles to anyone.\
  \ Living in the south started in 2010. First I taught three years in a rural area\
  \ then in a semi rural area till now. The feeling of Life as a burden got lower\
  \ especially when my salary shrinked down because of a loan. It\u2019s magical that\
  \ only when that happened that I got happier. Money made me sad because I had to\
  \ think about the deprived- the more you have, the more you have to think about\
  \ the ones who don\u2019t have. I have little; then I am out of responsibility:\
  \ richer ones have harder responsibility and duties towards the poor and life.\n\
  Before I came to the south I had travelled to Middle East; Egypt and Jordan. Responsible\
  \ (activism and spiritual) tourism. \nI love travelling; in Morocco I saw most imperial\
  \ places and have much of the joy experiencing the exotic and organic life many\
  \ never had. Travelling is a drug and elixir for those who search for adventure,\
  \ enjoyment and meaning. Internationally, I had the chance to see Egypt and Jordan.\
  \ In both places I tried to mention my nationality and people seemed very welcome\
  \ and friendly with it. People still don\u2019t consider you are a stranger than\
  \ if you come from Europe or America or if you are blond. \nOriginally my travel\
  \ was not for leisure. Or at least searching pleasure of another kind- the one that\
  \ transcend the body to something philosophical, moral, existential and spiritual,\
  \ historical, social and cultural.  In Egypt, I joined an international movement\
  \ I met on facebook that called for the removal of the siege on Gaza at that time.\
  \  I joined the not because Palestinians are Arabs but mostly because mostly I considered\
  \ it a human case. Egypt has very nice people.  By people, I mean the everyday people.\
  \ As a Moroccan, you just feel you are at home and that there is no much difference\
  \ between the places. The noise, the chaos, the dirt\u2026yet you can say, I felt\
  \ the extreme Egyptian generosity especially three opportunities; 1 a clothes seller\
  \ who offered me soft drink when I got to buy something from him, 2 a barber who\
  \ offered me a free service of cutting my hair, 3 a taxi driver who proposed a free\
  \ ride when I was going to airport going back home.\nAfter Egypt and the sit-in,\
  \ my responsible travel did not have meaning, so I thought to go somewhere else.\
  \ The choice was Jordan. I believe it was not me who chose. I have spiritual convictions\
  \ and background that I am pushed to my deeds. I did it for Jordan and spent much\
  \ of my stay in a Wihdat district, a place I didn\u2019t know it was originally\
  \ a Palestinian camp only later.  I was not very good tourists because I didn\u2019\
  t pay much in hotel and even slept in the open some times; The climatic one was\
  \ the day when I ran short of money and decided to sleep under a small palm tree.\
  \ I felt very desperate and did not notice what in the tree only when I lied down\
  \ to sleep. Wow! The small palm had dates and very good ones. I picked some and\
  \ I got enchanted and tearful- it just made me remember mother Mary- mother of Jesus.\
  \ I could feel her situation in the deep of my heart.\nIn the whole experiences,\
  \ I had the privilege to meet people from Egypt, France, Portugal, UK, Palestine,\
  \ Jordan, Kazakhstan, America, Czech, Qumurus Island, Algeria, Australia, and South\
  \ Korea. My intention was to meet the maximum people who share the globe.\nTravelling\
  \ is one means to grow in mindscape and be tolerating the other. I grew in mind\
  \ and personality and I believe now that all humans should unite against all that\
  \ threaten all human race; mostly pollution and climate change, food security, poverty...All\
  \ should think about the goodness of all to be global humans. People don\u2019t\
  \ make much benefit of their lives if they don\u2019t travel; being open in mind\
  \ and rich in experience, getting knowledge and wisdom are just to list some."
