Text: "From a young age, I knew I loved the outdoors. Driving out of Windhoek, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but be fascinated by the vast open spaces of Namibia. The problem was, my\
  \ family didn\u2019t enjoy camping and still doesn\u2019t, and for me, camping was\
  \ just those school trips we all had. At university, I went on a camping trip for\
  \ the first time. Setting up my tent was like an initiation into a new world. That\u2019\
  s when the camping bug officially bit me.\n\nAs a fresh graduate joining the working\
  \ class, I used my paychecks for camping trips, not shopping sprees. It was also\
  \ at this time that I met cool people who had the same interest as me in exploring\
  \ Namibia\u2019s countryside, and we formed a little \u201Ccamping clique\u201D\
  .\n\nI believe life is too short to go to the same place more than once, but I\u2019\
  ve been to Bagatelle in the Kalahari twice. It has beautiful red/orange dunes and\
  \ lots of activities. However, I think what made me love this place from the start\
  \ was the great reception we received. The human interaction combined with the experience\
  \ is what made it so special.\n\nBeing a Namibian means that I\u2019m blessed with\
  \ so many beautiful campsite options in my own country. When I plan a camping trip,\
  \ the first thing I do is to book the accommodation. Namibia is in demand and space\
  \ is often quite limited. It also helps to keep all your friends committed to a\
  \ trip if they\u2019ve paid their deposit.\n\nMy camping trips usually last only\
  \ two or three days, but this year I did something completely different. I went\
  \ to the Orange River for a five-day rafting trip, where we camped along the banks\
  \ of the river and slept under the stars. I remember the second night when I was\
  \ in my sleeping bag, looking up at the billions of stars above me and thinking:\
  \ this beats all my previous trips.\n\nRafting the Orange River was magical. Surreal\
  \ rock formations surrounded us, and there\u2019s this unexplained calmness as you\
  \ paddle along. Then, the sun sets, and everything is a stunning vivid orange. I\
  \ packed most of my stuff in watertight zip-lock bags so that they couldn\u2019\
  t get wet. Our tour operator, Amanzi Trails, provided three meals as part of the\
  \ rafting package and this made it so much less of a stress for us."
