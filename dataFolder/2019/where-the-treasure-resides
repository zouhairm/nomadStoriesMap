Text: "It has always been my principle to travel with a purpose, whatever it may be.\
  \ Since birthdays are supposed to be celebrated, I dedicated my Buscalan, Kalinga\
  \ trip to myself as a gift with a purpose of meeting the legendary \"mambabatok\"\
  \ or traditional Kalinga tattooist of the Philippines Apo Whang Od.\n\nA few days\
  \ after my birthday, I invited my sister to come with me to Buscalan, Tinglayan,\
  \ Kalinga - one of the mountainous provinces of the Northern Luzon where the Butbut\
  \ tribe can be found. Here is where the national treasure of the Philippines resides.\
  \ Being known as the last of her kind, Whang Od had drawn attention from all over\
  \ the world and having been tattooed by her is a genuine life's experience and honor.\n\
  \nAs we arrived at Buscalan, we were fortunate to have avoided the crowd as it was\
  \ a weekday. We had the chance to experience the simplicity and serenity of the\
  \ barrio as well as an authentic immersion with the Butbut tribe without interference\
  \ from flocks of tourists. Spending three days with a tribal family, who treated\
  \ us as if we were their children, was truly a life-changing experience. Aside from\
  \ that, we got to hang out with Whang Od and her granddaughter, Grace, who did my\
  \ first ever tattoo alongside the famous three-dot signature of Whang Od.\n\nIt\
  \ has been my habit to wake up as early as I could whenever I am traveling to not\
  \ miss the chance of enjoying an unfamiliar morning scene. In Buscalan, it was the\
  \ fresh morning breeze, the sound of the children who woke up early that day to\
  \ play games, the conversations between parents who began doing routinely chores\
  \ that signified the start of their day, and the smell of poultry animals that freely\
  \ roamed around the vicinity as if they were pets that invited me to get up and\
  \ witness how their life unfolds every single day.\n\nWhen the sun came down and\
  \ the moon started to rise, I felt that a good night was ahead of us despite the\
  \ lack of electricity in the area. Little did we know that we were blessed enough\
  \ to experience a bonfire night with the locals which only happens during occasions\
  \ such as fiestas and weddings. That time, I knew that I had fallen in love with\
  \ Buscalan already. We sat around the bonfire with few other guests and the locals,\
  \ who were mostly farmers and tour guides, as we enjoyed the heat from the fire\
  \ and the booze that was shared among us. It was one of the best nights I ever had\
  \ in my life. Clich\xE8 as it may sound but good things indeed happen in real life.\n\
  \nLeaving a place like Buscalan was as painful as leaving a childhood home. It was\
  \ hard for us especially that we already felt as if we were one with the tribe.\
  \ Despite the difficulty of departing, I still got the courage to move on for I\
  \ know deep inside me that I will come back to Buscalan that I call my second home\
  \ and the Butbut tribe that I call my second family.\n\nUp to this day, being able\
  \ to experience a couple of days living with the legendary tattooist and her tribe\
  \ has been a treasure no one can ever steal from me as it is embedded in my memory\
  \ for as long as I live. Having to live this day to tell this story gives me hope\
  \ of inspiring others to protect our respective motherlands and the culture they\
  \ uphold to be equally experienced by the generations to come."
