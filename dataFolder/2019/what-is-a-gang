Text: "What is a 'Gang' \n\nGuatemala is a wonder, like many wonders in this world,\
  \ which cannot be expressed in words, photographs, or reenactments of intent to\
  \ expose. It must be felt, and may not induce the same reaction on to others, as\
  \ it did for me. Central America captured the essence of what my soul had been without,\
  \ up until that point, in my 20 years of life. I was stepping in to the unknown\
  \ of adventure. What I landed on, was the dawning of what \u2018humanity\u2019 meant.\
  \ What living every day as if it was your last, veritably felt like.\n\nI never\
  \ intended to go to Guatemala, live there, work there and build a community. My\
  \ best friend told me that Guatemala was where we were going to volunteer, and so\
  \ we did. In being the executive decider on our destination, I trusted her choice\
  \ of location,. I wasn\u2019t about to question her. Instead, I remained loyal.\
  \ Something unexplainable eased any doubt that I had about going to a place I knew\
  \ nothing of, nor had ever given thought to go to. Something inside me knew that\
  \ there was fathomless value in letting go of my developed comforts. \n\nDriving\
  \ 40km from Guatemala City West to Antigua, was deeply awakening. The walls of buildings\
  \ lined with bullet holes, which I first mistook for weathered architecture, screamed\
  \ at me through the blinding light of the sun\u2019s reflection off of their facades.\
  \ \n\n\u201CNo, mi quierda. That is death and suffering\u201D.\n\nA voice inside\
  \ of me spoke. Why did this evil cause me such intrigue? \n\nWhile exiting the city,\
  \ I knew I needed to return. A country torn with violence beyond my capacity to\
  \ comprehend, was now my engulfed world and reality. There were Gangs, created through\
  \ the innocence of dance clubs and young people\u2019s desires to constructively\
  \ express themselves. A corrupt government, who\u2019s intent was not in the benefit\
  \ of the people, but for the greed of its \u201Cdemocratic\u201D leaders. The culture\
  \ of Gang\u2019s and their warfare, was now the cusp of my curiousity. \n\n\"These\
  \ are humans. Humans, like me\".\n\nArriving to my home-base, I quickly made arrangements\
  \ to volunteer at \u2018Camino Seguro\u2019 in Zona 3, home to El Basurero (Garbage\
  \ Dump), where locals made their income. As I bused there in the mornings, I could\
  \ smell my destination before I saw it. Shoes, dangling from telephone lines and\
  \ piles of garbage strewn across the streets. The same bullet holes I witnessed\
  \ upon my arrival. \n\nI have never seen lice so abundant that it causes one\u2019\
  s hair to appear dusty. I did not know cities were divided in to \u2018Zones\u2019\
  \ according to their average income levels, murder rates and disease. I\u2019ve\
  \ never seen such a vivid bruise of a hand-mark on a child\u2019s face that of course\
  \ this screamed abuse, yet, the 8-year-old victim would repeatedly insist that she\
  \ fell down a set of stairs. The hurricane of grace, humbling grace, that flooded\
  \ my being, over-took my entire entity. \n\nMy naivety assured me, leading up to\
  \ stepping foot in to Guatemala City, that \u2018Good\u2019 would always prevail\
  \ over \u2018Evil\u2019. What was discovered, is that \u2018Evil\u2019 balances\
  \ \u2018Good\u2019, and without \u2018Good\u2019s\u2019 counterpart, we cannot see\
  \ the light through the shadows. Why was this my desire? Because, the longer I lived\
  \ in Guatemala, and with a local family, the more I envied their lives.   \n\nThere\
  \ is something to be said for the freedom of simplicity. Living with necessities,\
  \ versus excess. I witnessed people suffer through an unimaginable hell, according\
  \ to the standards of most North Americans. But, these people had more freedom than\
  \ most will ever know living in Canada or the United States. They lived everyday\
  \ more fully because each day brought immeasurable risk. \n\nI did not know what\
  \ I lacked. I did not know what had been invisible to me, yet, there all along.\
  \ Guatemala revealed the understanding of connection, unconditional love and undeniable\
  \ truth that we all belong to each other, on this planet.\n\nHumanity is our indoctrination\
  \ to the world. It is connection. But, what makes every human so different from\
  \ the next? It is love, light and balance. This is what I found. This is what a\
  \ Gang is."
