Text: "It was just an idea. A girl from the projects of Brooklyn only has ideas like\
  \ these. We were at a bar just sitting when someone spoke about travelling. That's\
  \ all I needed, just that idea. That idea turned into a dream and then it was all\
  \ just dreams. It was 2013 when that idea that was then just a dream turned into\
  \ a reality. I worked two jobs for 6 months and save 4000$ USD and backpacked Europe.\
  \ There were nights I slept on a park bench like i did in Switzerland. It was liberating\
  \ when I slept in a park in France. I made it down to Greece. Never thinking sleeping\
  \ on a beach would be so cold. There was a couple sleeping on the same beach speaking\
  \ about Australia. That gave me an idea. I applied online for a working holiday\
  \ visa to Australia. As an American under 30 years of age, we have the opportunity\
  \ for applying for this visa. I had no plans all I knew was I was landing in Perth\
  \ November 3rd. \n\nI landed in Perth. Wow was it just amazing. I walked every where\
  \ without shoes. Restaurants, Grocery stores, malls.. It was the culture there.\
  \ Within two weeks, I began hospitality work as a bartender at a hotel. I never\
  \ bartender before; I searched all of Youtube to learn the skills for this job.\
  \ But I wasn't satisfied, I came to Australia to live on the road. So I searched\
  \ online and found a job on the beach in the Great Ocean Road. And thats how it\
  \ all began. My dreams were real for a whole year I lived the nomad life I had wanted.\
  \ From there I would work on a sheep farm from the sheep farm I found myself on\
  \ a plane in New Zealand. \n\nOh New Zealand, you took my heart and my body for\
  \ 4 years. How I never saw that happened. I worked and saved. From there went to\
  \ Thailand and saw the monkeys and elephants they talk about on television. Then\
  \ I couldn't stop, I ended up in South America volunteering in Colombia. Months\
  \ later I was told about a small country called Belize. Sadly, Belize wasn't a forgiving\
  \ country to live poor. To be poor in Belize is a dangerous gig. From there I came\
  \ back home with my tail in between my legs filled with failure. I gave up for a\
  \ whole year. Belize had hurt my soul and dreams that it left me bruised. \n\nToday,\
  \ I decided to get back up. I overheard a story of a traveller in a bar in New Jersey.\
  \ All I needed was just an idea. Turns out, it was my friends talking about me.\
  \ Then I knew, I was the only one that gave up on myself. Looking forward to this\
  \ new dream to be the next reality."
