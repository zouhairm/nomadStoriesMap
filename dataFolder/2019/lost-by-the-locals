Text: "I've spent my two months last summer mostly in Bangkok, Thailand, but I do\
  \ visiting other cities after. \n\nHave you ever thought of living alone in a country\
  \ you don't even understand the language, have no friends and the only thing you\
  \ have was braveness, have you? If yes then you can relate on this story of mine.\n\
  \nLast summer, I went to Bangkok for doing my internship, it was a really great\
  \ experience I had, until now I always feeling lucky to have such a great moment\
  \ there with internship friends, mentors, and locals. \nSince I decided to take\
  \ the two months visa to stay, ofcourse it won't lead me to stay in the hotel for\
  \ two months, I choosed apartment in a full-Thai area, know nothing about the road,\
  \ food, nothing. But this is why this story is unforgettable for me, yes in these\
  \ 2 months almost all the time I got lost by the locals, I use body language all\
  \ the time, I have no idea where to go or what to eat, I feel like people is laughing\
  \ at me even some of them are trying to help. Because as you know, especially the\
  \ oldies of Thai are don't know anything about English, they're just speaking their\
  \ own languages. \n\nOne time I went for dinner in front of my apartment, I was\
  \ willing to buy noodle, the mom (seller) can't speak English, nobody can, until\
  \ came her daughter who at least can understand some words. I was telling her \"\
  I want a yellow noodle, with beef and without soup\" , but guys don't think I say\
  \ it with loud and clear voice, I was telling her by pointing on the etalase and\
  \ they were playing their eyebrows to understand me, after that the seller will\
  \ always remember what menu I will choose (lol).\n\nAnother story of buying foods,\
  \ this time I bought a drink it was 'Mew Ai' or in English it sounds like 'Milk\
  \ Ice'. Seriously guys I have to sound like Thai to make them understand, so I said\
  \ \"one Mew Ai please\" and she was confused and then somebody came over and ordered\
  \ it for me and teach me how to order, she said I can say \"Mew Ai neung ka\" to\
  \ order one Mew Ai, and again that was the only menu I can order there. Until now\
  \ I got sick of drinking that because almost everyday during that 2 months I've\
  \ been drinking that beverage. \n\nLast one the most fun of lost by local moments\
  \ was lost by taxi or tuktuk (traditional Thailand public transport) drivers. Everytime\
  \ I want to order them, I have to show them the picture of the address, that was\
  \ the ONLY thing I can do if I want to arrive in my destination. I was taken in\
  \ wrong way, wrong address, wrong house, wrong malls, wrong destinations, but sadly\
  \ I can't complain because even I do they won't understand a single word from me.\
  \ \n\nThose moments are the moments which give me such connection with locals, I\
  \ got known words, places, foods, because I use to connect and contact and in touch\
  \ with them by real connections. Now I have so many Thai friends, i can be able\
  \ to tell some numbers, words, name of foods, name of important words in Thai, thanks\
  \ to my two-months experience I has there. I won't ever forget that."
