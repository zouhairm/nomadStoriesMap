Text: "My grandfathers are alive, but I've never met either of them. One lives in\
  \ the same city as me, he's just too stubborn to acknowledge my existence because\
  \ of a fight with my father years before I was born. The other disappeared when\
  \ my mother was a toddler. Little did I know that, at twenty five, I would find\
  \ a grandfather, a nonno, in Florence, Italy.\n\nI'm visiting Elena, one of my favorite\
  \ people. She's always laughing, prone to sunburns and her short fiery hair is always\
  \ blowing all over the place. \"We can stay with my nonno\" Elena had told me over\
  \ the phone. I am ecstatic. Could there possibly be a better opportunity to see\
  \ a new place than through familiar eyes? In Florence, the capital of Tuscany and\
  \ the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance, I am determined to discover what it\
  \ means to be Italian. \n\nWhen I first meet nonno he seems stern and serious, but\
  \ I can sense that it might not be the case. He has traveled all over the world.\
  \ We have no common language aside from a little French he picked up living in Algeria\
  \ for over twenty years. He wants to make sure I get a proper tour, according to\
  \ Elena.\n\nWe walk at a slow, grandfatherly pace through the streets of Florence,\
  \ me and Elena each holding one of nonno\u2019s arms in ours. He seems to find me\
  \ amusing, thinking I am especially silly taking photos of street art, which he\
  \ was just commenting was a shame (though I didn't understand that part). \n \n\
  After soaking in the wonder of sharing ancient cobblestone streets and brightly\
  \ colored buildings with selfie-stick brandishing tourists unappealingly licking\
  \ their gelato, I am in awe of the city. Florence feels magical and ancient. The\
  \ light is different, somehow more golden. The air is unique and historic. \n \n\
  Walking home through the heart of the city, I feel the Duomo is following us, peering\
  \ in from a different angle everytime we pass another street. I can tell nonno is\
  \ pleased to have accomplished his mission from one traveler to another: to maintain\
  \ the sparkle of wonder and curiosity in my eyes all day.  \n\nBack at the apartment\
  \ we lounge in the living room and sip vin santo, an incredibly sweet liqueur accompanied\
  \ by cantucci: locally made almond biscotti.\n \nThe next day, he insists on taking\
  \ us for dinner. On the banks of the glimmering river Arno, with the sun low in\
  \ the sky, we sit outside on the terrace of an old stone building, flowers bursting\
  \ from cracks between the stones, threatening to take over.\n\nI learn the true\
  \ Italian way to coil the long noodles around my fork into the perfect bite-sized\
  \ bundle while nonno tells us about working in Iraq, experiencing its incredible\
  \ beauty which today is all but destroyed. Later Elena tells me that he very rarely\
  \ shares his stories other than with his family.\n\nI\u2019m surprised to learn\
  \ that the pasta was just an appetizer. As Elena and nonno laugh and laugh, the\
  \ waiter sets down a giant boiling plate of seafood. It\u2019s overflowing with\
  \ shellfish and topped with homemade bread and lemon wedges. I am so full I think\
  \ I will burst. \n\nThe next morning we wake early for one last cornetti and caffe.\
  \ We\u2019ve been here for breakfast every morning to enjoy fluffy pastries stuffed\
  \ with jam, cream, or chocolate. Something about knowing I won\u2019t be doing this\
  \ again makes me feel quiet.\n\nWaiting for the bus I start to prepare myself mentally\
  \ to let go of this person who already feels like family. I realize that I wanted\
  \ to learn about Italian culture and ended up living it myself. Through sharing\
  \ food, sharing love through food and finding comfort, I became a nieta. \n\nThe\
  \ bus pulls to a stop and to my surprise, nonno steps on. We ride mostly in silence.\
  \ Arriving to the train station they help me get my ticket. My train is set to leave\
  \ in 10 minutes. After a long hard hug I turn to go. I feel tears stream down my\
  \ cheeks and I look to see them mirrored back."
