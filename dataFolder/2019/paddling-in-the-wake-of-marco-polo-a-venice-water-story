Text: "As a lifelong surfer and ocean lover, I am enchanted by water. Despite no surfable\
  \ waves, the power of water drew me to Venice, Italy with my inflatable stand up\
  \ paddle board in a bag, ready to inflate my dreams of piercing the glassy canal\
  \ waters that served as home to Marco Polo. Representing a commercial, cultural\
  \ and geographical confluence of Eastern and Western worlds, the physical reality\
  \ of Venice is a globally unique stage to witness the union of human life and the\
  \ world of water. \n\nIt was on this stage that I plotted my leap into the unknown\
  \ dimensions of sharing the canal waters with those who pursue daily life in Venice.\
  \ The intensity of traffic on the Grand Canal with all forms and sizes of watercraft\
  \ represented a challenge similar to skateboarding on a busy freeway. Meanwhile\
  \ the tranquility and solace of the back canals provided another, subtle form of\
  \ sensory overload.\n\nMy virgin paddle was an exercise of water lust that functioned\
  \ to purge my adrenaline. Landing with jet lag the sight of the Grand Canal and\
  \ the hidden, twisting back canals generated an unforeseen energy within me to pump\
  \ up my board and piece together my paddle for a quick introduction to Venice. Carrying\
  \ my board to the steps of an entry point used for water taxi pick-ups, I had to\
  \ smile yet ignore the bursts of greetings and advice shouted my way: don't fall;\
  \ don\u2019t go to the Grand Canal; avoid the Gondolas. I was ready to get stopped\
  \ by someone, anyone. And surely I was ready for the water police to end my effort.\n\
  \nNone of that happened. The first strokes of my paddle blade in the calm waters\
  \ of that narrow canal connecting to the Grand Canal was one of the most memorable\
  \ water experiences of my life. Passing by buildings that surged upward with 'water\
  \ garages' and peeling paint, overhanging balconies, flower pots, kitchens bursting\
  \ with culinary odors, school kids and tourists gawking from bridges, and navigating\
  \ past other boat craft made me forget the passage of time. \n\nFor in reality I\
  \ was in my own time machine. I stood and wove through curving canals and past plazas\
  \ and under bridges. In fact, I truly got lost and after emerging out onto the Grand\
  \ Canal, was able to locate my canal-side rental studio through landmarks I had\
  \ noted before launching. Water taxis closely buzzed the rails of my board, no doubt\
  \ testing my balance and nerve. Gondoliers provided a full range of reactions from\
  \ scoff to acceptance. My \u2018quick\u2019 paddle to work off the jet lag literally\
  \ became a three hour tour.\n\nOver the next week, experiencing all the cultural,\
  \ architectural and historical wonders of Venice was like living a dream with a\
  \ passport to Venetian life that only a self-propelled watercraft could provide.\
  \ With evening lights illuminating my path, cool air misted off the water surface\
  \ while gliding through canals being shared by gondolas and singing gondoliers.\
  \ Floating past restaurants, bars, hotels and plazas with food, music, laughter\
  \ and cigarette smoke in the air, everything swirled together into a paddling experience\
  \ unlike anything I had ever experienced or anticipated. \n\nWords cannot describe\
  \ the feeling of sliding underneath the Bridge of Sighs, or Rialto Bridge at sunrise\
  \ when the reddish sky gives way to the sights and sounds of Venice waking up to\
  \ another day. The working boats and daily life of the canal waters roared to life\
  \ with speeding water buses packed with tourists, and locals commuting to school\
  \ and work. The sheer absence of cars is the real magic of Venice. The dynamics\
  \ of water, tides and constant movement of boats created a backdrop for human activity\
  \ that when viewed while standing atop my paddle board, provided a cherished sense\
  \ of access and intimacy. \n\nRespect for the locals and the working reality of\
  \ Venetian waters is of upmost importance to any such paddling endeavor. The non-obvious\
  \ rewards are infinite. For example, a violin school on one narrow canal produced\
  \ powerful acoustical harmony and energy bouncing off the water and between buildings\
  \ that made me feel the embrace of Venice. And perhaps even the smile of Marco Polo."
