Text: "Sun looked at me as I looked at her. She caressed my skin in her last moments\
  \ of the day as a comfort, a reminder that she\u2019ll be back after the long night.\
  \ These days doubt didn\u2019t touch me. She made a promise to this world billions\
  \ of years ago and she\u2019s kept it ever since. \n\nAs she dipped beyond the horizon,\
  \ the sky sang in shades of pinks and blues to bring me dreams of love and tranquility.\
  \ I woke up in my usual spot, the small mattress in the frost bitten VW mini van.\
  \ This time 50 miles deeper into the desert. The night had been colder than the\
  \ last, making the drive a test of my own persistence. How committed was I to my\
  \ journey? \n\nSun made her presence known as the sky sang again in the colours\
  \ of every feeling. The cup between each palm no longer held warmth and gratitude\
  \ washed over me as she began to rise. \u201CGood morning Sun.\u201D 4:55am. She\
  \ winked at me as she raised, changes are coming, I knew exactly what she meant\
  \ as summer was coming to an end. I also knew that I wasn\u2019t going to make it\
  \ to see the next summer. Although the thought of death no longer scared me, I allowed\
  \ myself a brief moment of wallowing sadness for my body that would be left behind\
  \ to rot.\n\nThe last few months seemed short. My first thought as I woke again\
  \ in my cold VW. November 27th. Exactly 3 months ago I had first felt the inevitable\
  \ cold mornings that were to come. My body was beginning to shut down, my lungs\
  \ aches and blood came with every cough. The bright yellow bobble hat was my new\
  \ wig covered the small patches of hair I did have left.\n\nI wasn\u2019t long off\
  \ my Sun spot. The raident god suggested the childhood spot to let my soul leave\
  \ this body a few years ago. She told me of the peace it would bring after my journey,\
  \ and she told me the way around the continents to see every monument left behind\
  \ for her. I had wished the society I was in now worshiped her as loudly as they\
  \ had back then.\n\nSun talked to me quite often now a days as the nights drew longer\
  \ and my body grew weaker; she understood how reliant my body was on her to keep\
  \ my soul vibrations high. I wanted to go home to her so bad but i couldn\u2019\
  t just abandon my body in a waste land. As Sun had put it, the body is the temple\
  \ of the soul, where ever your feet carry you and whenever your ribs protect you,\
  \ you you are at home. I hadn\u2019t seen it so heavily sugar coated before, but\
  \ I held my faith and enjoyed the lessons on the way. Now I just longed for Sun\
  \ to take me home, the quicker I got to God spot the quicker Sun would hold me close\
  \ again. She watched my every move in her wakened state and sent moon to watch over\
  \ me when I traveled and slept. \n\n4:44am. I drove the familiar road for the last\
  \ time on my own in pitch black. Life had been good to me through perspective. I\
  \ stuck by that belief now no matter what, even as my body ate away at its self.\
  \ I climbed onto the small mattress for for a lay bit of warmth for what I knew\
  \ as my last time. \n\nShe woke later than yesterday and smiled at me as climbed\
  \ out of the van. \u201CLast push then we\u2019re free darlin.\u201D I spoke gently\
  \ to my body as she carried my up the steep hill. Everything over grown from my\
  \ last memory and I couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201CYou healed too huh?\u201D\
  \ The trees listened but didn\u2019t reply. \n\nI sat where I had once before. A\
  \ calm presence sat with me suddenly and I felt nothing but love.\n\nI didn\u2019\
  t expect to find my fathers love here after all these years. But he waited in faith.\
  \ \n\n\u201CI\u2019m here dad, let\u2019s do home.\u201D\n\nSun welcomed us as eye\
  \ of God."
