Text: "We are walking ATMs. We are just waiting for someone to lure us into the right\
  \ place. Our precise role in tens of thousands of scripts it\u2019s always the same:\
  \ listen to polished monologues delivered in one breath, nod attentively. \nSometimes\
  \ the fablers intercept your trajectory. Sometimes they follow quietly as crocodiles\
  \ in the water, eyes peeping out of the surface. They\u2019re all just waiting for\
  \ a crack to move. A wavering, a check of the map.\nYou can never let your guard\
  \ down.\n\nEverything is unusually still in 8 am Jodhpur. On the way from the night\
  \ train to the hotel nothing has been offered to us.\nFrom the hotel\u2019s rooftop,\
  \ the Mehrangarh fort is a hazy horizontal monolith hovering on a stretch of narrow\
  \ flat roofs calling for a daredevilish chase.\nThe intro is classic: \"Which country?\"\
  \nTK is the sixty-year-old landlord with the open chest shirt. The man wearing the\
  \ blue tracksuit is a boxing coach, the Trojan horse opening the doors of the conversation.\n\
  \"One of his athletes just won an international medal in Poland.\"\n\"Would you\
  \ like to see our athletes training? Be our guest. Meet us downstairs at 6 pm.\"\
  \nSilvia stiffens, lingering. Over the past two weeks this kind of tropes has brought\
  \ us to countless shops, restaurants, art\u2019s schools, temples where salvific\
  \ prayers are quoted 500 rupees per minute.\nAs an act of self-defence, I on the\
  \ other hand have become an Indian deity - countless arms deflecting trade, insistence,\
  \ and tuk-tuks.\nBut curious invitations latch onto me.\n\nAt 6 pm we\u2019re riding\
  \ on the back of two vespas through hundreds of traffic layers moving in a jerky\
  \ parallax you can\u2019t get used to.\nThe schoolyard is delimited by brownish\
  \ rectangular buildings. We get off the vespas under a sign saying GYM. The scene\
  \ unfolding in front of us is unexpected, immediately clear, and it makes our hands\
  \ sweaty.\nIn the large hall, a multitude of kids is kicking wicker plastic balls\
  \ across a volleyball net. We get seated along one of the walls. As TK nods, all\
  \ the kids gather in rows sorted by age and gender. We are introduced as prestigious\
  \ international guests.\nEvery kid tells us their name, school grade and how long\
  \ they\u2019ve been playing Sepak Takraw \u2013 that\u2019s the name of this Asian\
  \ game.\nThen TK introduces the speeches: Silvia will motivate the girls, I\u2019\
  ll talk to the boys. My embarrassed English speaks about the heart and the seize-it-while\
  \ you-can.\nThey bring us marigold wreaths, while a flock of photographs, live videos\
  \ shared on Facebook and handshakes envelop an important event set up from nothing\
  \ with nothing, running smoothly under the watchful, paternal gaze of TK.\nThe kids\
  \ are ecstatic.\nWe take a monumental group photo. We are the only ones seated.\n\
  \nLess than fifteen minutes later, we will have gotten to another place - a university\
  \ campus only a short ride away from there.\nThe sun will be setting, and there\
  \ will be a boxing ring in the middle of a shady square. Silly pictures of us will\
  \ be taken on this ring while wearing boxing gloves. More flower wreaths, more motivational\
  \ speeches, more smiles.\nAbout seventy kids \u2013 from poor families, with few\
  \ opportunities - will surround us asking about Italy, touching Silvia\u2019s blonde\
  \ hair. In the hundreds of pictures that will be taken, everyone will be in a fighter\
  \ pose screaming \"Muscles!\"\nJust as usual, TK\u2019s eyes don\u2019t miss anything.\
  \ He\u2019s the uncle who coaches you about life, checks on your behaviour, teaches\
  \ you how to rebel against bullies, showing you a way through life.\nHe gives it\
  \ all he has and the kids give it all they have. It\u2019s so evident. And the kids\
  \ are all really there. None of them has a smartphone. Our Facebook contact is a\
  \ floating piece of paper nearly shredded by the dozens of hands that want to grab\
  \ it.\nImprov actors say \"Learn to accept the cues, good things will happen.\"\n\
  \nBy 8 pm we are outside the hotel. And it all ends there: no shops, no trades,\
  \ no monologues.\nWe are now the ecstatic ones, as we hang our orange wreaths on\
  \ the window handles in our room."
