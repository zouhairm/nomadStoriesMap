Text: "I was born in Korea but moved to the Philippines since grade 2. Since then,\
  \ I loved to travel and see the world. I got to travel more than regular Korean\
  \ students because of my Visa renual but this gave me huge impact when ever it came\
  \ to traveling. I\u2019ve been to 13 countries soon 15. And now I am back in Korea\
  \ for my education but when I meet people saying \u201Ctraveling is a waste of money\u201D\
  \ it hurts my feeling. \n\nWhen ever I travel, I learn new things. Meet the people\
  \ that you can never forget and even know more about yourself. Sometimes, not expecting\
  \ anything can really bring you to the \u201Cplace you will never forget\u201D \n\
  \nThe last travels I had was in India where people say its one of the worst place\
  \ to travel to. I stayed there for 6 weeks with other interns. After a week, I got\
  \ an illness called \u201Csalmonella\u201D. But even if I was sick for nearly 2\
  \ weeks, I still did not want to go back because of the people who I stayed with.\
  \ I went to India through a volunteer. People in our group work everyday from 9am\
  \ to 4-5 pm yet, they would wake up in the morning, check on me then go to work,\
  \ come back and chat with me all day long. If I did not choose this open heart to\
  \ travel to India, I would have not met these amazing people. \n \nThen, I became\
  \ really close with this girl from moroco, we traveled together to new delhi without\
  \ any planning. No plane ticket back to Hyderabad (that was our voulteer area. Far\
  \ from the north) no train or bus ticket ahead at all. Just ourselves , money and\
  \ our phones. We traveled to the north to get my friends visa done. Then we realized\
  \ we had no plans. The first day of arrival, we stayed overnight at the ticketing\
  \ area because we did not know that we could not come bacl in to the airport once\
  \ we leave. So we went to the office to stay for bout 8 hours. Also because it is\
  \ dangerous to travel at night in India. Then the following day we went to get my\
  \ friends visa done then headed to  subway to find train tickets to Agra.  \nWe\
  \ asked the local police  to help us to buy train tickets by their credit cards\
  \ because we could not do it ourselves. And I thought they would disagree. But he\
  \ was so friendly and helped us with everything. (Even if he was not a travel agent)\
  \ and did not even accept tips. This was just to see Taj mahal from delhi. The train\
  \ station was just like as if you would see in the movies. We started to feel scared.\
  \ Then we asked this family because they could speak english. \u201Ccan we sit with\
  \ you\u201D  They agreed and even told us what and what not to do in the train.\
  \ Then when we went to Agra, we were panicking because the same Taxi app wouldn\u2019\
  t work. And there were strange men who seemed to be following us. So we ran to the\
  \ train station lounge. We stayed there over night to feel safe. Then after seeing\
  \ Agra, we needed to go back to delhi so thankfully thistime, we rode the bus instead\
  \ of the train that we bought as a sleeper class.(the cheapest) We arrived back\
  \ to delhi and realized there was no train back to Hyderabad... We went to the airport\
  \ as fast as we could. Called our parents even if it was 2am or 12am. Thankfully\
  \ we were able to buy the ticket tho in such a high price. But we were relieved\
  \ that we were able to go back to Hyderabad. \n This doesn\u2019t seem like to be\
  \ a serious story. But when I was there in India, it was as if I was in a survival\
  \ movie and going to the country that I never expected to go, made me have another\
  \ chapter of my life.  This is one of my story of\u201Dthe place that I will never\
  \ forget\u201D"
