Text: "I had my first travel epiphany back in 2013. Fresh out of University, green,\
  \ eager to see the world, I set off for Europe in hopes of experiencing the European\
  \ world that I had spent the last four years learning about. I still vividly remember\
  \ stepping off of the plane in Dublin. The salty brisk ocean breeze, the foreign\
  \ accents, the beautiful women\u2026 I was awe stricken, captured, and taken. Naturally,\
  \ after spending eight hours on a vacuum packed intercontinental flight, with two\
  \ hours of sleep and an empty stomach, I was thirsty. First stop, bars. I hop on\
  \ the local bus and, head downtown and make sure to quench my thirst with a pint\
  \ of \u201Cthe black stuff\u201D. I\u2019ve heard tales of this ethereal, legendary\
  \ drink, from how it\u2019s poured, to the time it takes; pouring this black creamy\
  \ beverage is no joke. So serious are the Irish when it comes to pouring this beer,\
  \ that they actually have quality assurance specialists who make sure that bars\
  \ in the area pour it according to strict standards. After arriving at the bar I,\
  \ order a pint of \u201Cthe black stuff\u201D and watch the magic happen. From the\
  \ second the tap is pulled, the rushing black fluid, hits the base of the pint glass,\
  \ emanating a milky cloud of black, grey and chestnut brown smoke. As the glass\
  \ is filled, and the smoke clears what is left is an enchanting, almost supernatural.\
  \ I lean in to taste my first sip of the sacred nectar, but before I do the kind,\
  \ fire haired Irish bartender says \u201Cslainte\u201D. I raise my glass, give him\
  \ a nod, gasp, \u201Cslainte\u201D and go in for a gulp. It\u2019s, smooth, damn\
  \ smooth, certainly better than anything I\u2019ve had in Canada. It\u2019s liquid\
  \ gold, heaven in a glass, creamy, delicious, frothy, and perspiring. This first\
  \ pint of Guinness would prove to be the beginning of my taste for quality food\
  \ and beverage. It was a glimpse into the rabbit whole, the great beyond, and the\
  \ next dimension. So good was this pint, that I decided to enjoy a plethora, along\
  \ with a great Irish lamb potpie. \nMy first day in Europe and things were going\
  \ well, I had a mild buzz on, my stomach was full, and the sun was shining\u2026\
  \ until it wasn\u2019t. Being a seaside city, Dublin often experiences vast weather\
  \ changes. It can go from hot humid, sunny weather to black skies and showers in\
  \ a second. I figured I\u2019d risk it and try to get to my hostel by foot, figuring\
  \ \u201Cwhat the hell! Might as well save some money\u201D, this wasn\u2019t the\
  \ first time that I\u2019ve said this, and it sure as hell wasn\u2019t the last\
  \ time\u2026 Sure enough, on cue, the sky soon opens up to unleash a pestilential\
  \ hailstorm. A mad dizzying torrent ensues and I find myself marinating in water,\
  \ soaked from head to tow, running flat out to get to cover. Had I known I would\
  \ be running through the Dublin streets like a soldier going over the top, I would\
  \ have dressed for the occasion. After ducking and covering underneath a little\
  \ alcove on a side street, I assess the damage. Bag? Soaked. Shoes? Soaked. Shirt?\
  \ Soaked. Jacket? Soaked. Damn\u2026 \nAs I saunter on, feet squishing with swampy\
  \ marinade, I\u2019m captured. The ancient streets of Dublin envelop me and invade\
  \ my soul. Archaic boulevards lined with cobblestone and rocks are juxtaposed with\
  \ millennial old buildings. The streets glimmer with the ferocity of the newly emerged\
  \ sun and sparkle like diamonds. It is here that poets, journalists and writers\
  \ from all over the world have gained fame and drawn inspiration. Writers like Joyce,\
  \ Wilde, and Beckett all lived in this ancient beautiful city, and drew inspiration\
  \ from it. Above me, the seagulls chant, croon and bicker singing tales of the sea,\
  \ and with it defining and cementing the feeling of Dublin. This is a sea city,\
  \ and the smells, sounds and scenes are beginning to wear off on me.  I read and\
  \ dreamed about this place for years, and now I\u2019m here, feet saturated, clothing\
  \ sopping and smiling ear to ear."
