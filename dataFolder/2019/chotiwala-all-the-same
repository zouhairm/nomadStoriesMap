Text: "Our day\u2019s driver, Mobin, tried to point us toward a restaurant in Haridwar\
  \ where we could be sure to get clean, tasty food for dinner. We heard him say Chotiwala,\
  \ orange building, hotel, and my friend and I figured we understood the directions.\
  \ We crossed one of many bridges, each with a unique design, passed disabled people\
  \ rolling on dollies and vendors hawking ritual baskets and cheap souvenirs, to\
  \ reach the bustling heart of this town on the Ganges. All we could think about\
  \ was Mobin's suggestion of chana bhatura as restaurants\u2019 specialties taunted\
  \ our noses.\n\nBut there was no restaurant in the Hotel Chotiwala next to the orange\
  \ building. And the restaurant next to the hotel had an entirely different name.\
  \ Across the way, a big blue awning said, Chotiwala, but Mobin hadn\u2019t mentioned\
  \ across. We were hungry, confused, and starting to argue in the middle of a place\
  \ where we were drawing a collection of children asking for money. To preserve our\
  \ otherwise positive feelings about our long trek out of Delhi, we agreed to table\
  \ the choice.\n\nWe\u2019d really come to Haridwar for the evening\u2019s aarti\
  \ on the Ganges, even though we had only a na\xEFve understanding of what that was.\
  \ Sitting on the ghat, one step above the rising water, facing the chanting priests,\
  \ brought a fascination that calmed our hunger. We listened to passionate words\
  \ we didn\u2019t understand and watched rituals that could have meant anything.\
  \ Until we struck up a conversation.\n\nThe family next to us were on their second\
  \ trip to the river from the Himalayas. We chatted about how excited they were to\
  \ replenish a plastic jug they\u2019d brought to collect holy water, and about food.\
  \ They weren\u2019t sure about where to find Mobin\u2019s recommendation, but they\
  \ gave us directions to a Chotiwala all the same. And when we later asked them what\
  \ was happening in the ceremony, we all laughed that they had thought we were just\
  \ antsy to go eat.\n\nThey told us the priest was reminding everyone that we were\
  \ there to worship the river and should respect it always by keeping it clean. Meanwhile,\
  \ a steady stream of people prayed over diyas, baskets made of leaves and filled\
  \ with roses, marigolds, incense and a candle, before floating them down the river.\
  \ Soon, the whole area brightened as the chanting intensified and the priests lit\
  \ small pyres in bowls they held in their hands. Their movements, like a fire dance,\
  \ spread light and smoke, enchanting everyone in the holy place.\n\nBecause we couldn\u2019\
  t follow along on our own, the ending came abruptly and the fires extinguished.\
  \ We thanked our new friends and wished each other well, but their family was on\
  \ a spiritual trip and we were foreign tourists looking for local food.\n\nThis\
  \ time we followed their directions, over a bridge toward the shops and up ahead\
  \ on the right, we found it. The third Chotiwala. This was definitely not what Mobin\
  \ had described. We were down the hill from the original location, totally confused,\
  \ and ready to throw up our hands. But we took a hungry guess and returned to the\
  \ blue awning from the beginning of our search. \n\nSitting at a laminate picnic\
  \ table, we finally ordered chana bhatura and two glasses of chai. Soon, a large\
  \ metal plate was placed between us, but all we could see were the massive, fried\
  \ bubbles of dough. Each looked as big as a regular dinner plate and glistened with\
  \ oil around its perfect golden brown crust. They were far more exciting than anything\
  \ we\u2019d imagined. Then, our eyes turned to the sauced portions served alongside,\
  \ one scoop of chickpeas and a second of potatoes, both in a chartreuse sauce that\
  \ emitted a glorious aroma of spices we couldn\u2019t identify and couldn\u2019\
  t stop eating. We used the bread to spoon and sop and purred at each other through\
  \ every bite until only the metal plate remained.\n\nBy then it was dark and we\
  \ still had 6 hours back to Delhi, so we made our way to Mobin\u2019s car. We raved\
  \ about the evening and the dish, and he chuckled. It was the wrong Chotiwala, but\
  \ not for us."
