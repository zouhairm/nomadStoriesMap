Text: I gave you all of me .. so that I can see you & me as we. I gave u all my time
  , in hopes of you being forever mine.. our life is actually on edge far from this
  world we sledge ... I always treated u with superiority knowing you giving me the
  last priority ... When I loved you , you acted to be numb I was so dumb I can see
  my thoughts getting scum... You came back to me but the distance is what I see,
  for me you are not chimera luckily we captured some best memories in camera ....
  With you so high we are really near to the sky. Finally by your side into deep love
  we slide. This ups in treks & downs in life is just another ride baby together we
  can swim this tide never ever to you I lied ..... All I want is you are not grinded
  & I be yours only one it's not all just fun. All being complicated between two when
  I can love you & only you . I always try to understand why can't you take a firm
  stand ..... We need to stop this for God sake I believe this is not our last trek
  every morning cuddling you I wake . You need to break to make what he himself not
  gonna break ??? More from this I can't even try to make ohh good I can't fake .....
  Spend 31 hours with you need more million years with you just by the thought of
  it I got blew. Deep valley of love & hate where we fall it's all on fate !!!!
