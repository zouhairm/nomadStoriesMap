Text: "It was cool night in September, 2018 and we were about to sleep in the university\
  \ hostel, my friend presented an idea of one day hiking trip to Miranjani hills\
  \ in Pakistan. Despite my busy schedule, I couldn\u2019t deny as I am already passionate\
  \ about trekking.\nIn the morning, at 5:30 am we left the campus and procured the\
  \ destination after two hours of excited travelling. Miranjani hills were notorious\
  \ for remote location along with wild animals. Its peak was at a height of 9816ft\
  \ from sea level. We expected great contest regarding these troubles being excited\
  \ and enthusiastic. We were on the verge of start, a local guide appeared, suddenly.\
  \ He instructed us about the difficulty level, multiple trek blending issues and\
  \ offered his services but we were supposed to unlock the achievement by ourselves.\
  \ \nThe journey started. Lovely weather promoting passion, cold wind supporting\
  \ strength and lush greenery relaxing eyes were the charms. Moving further, we passed\
  \ by a group of monkeys and realized actual notorious reputation of track and our\
  \ agitation started converting into seriousness. All of sudden, my friend shouted,\
  \ \u201Cwe found the company\u201D. Luckily they were hikers and looking for some\
  \ water, we helped them and moved on. After one hour we reached the top. It was\
  \ full of green foliage and clouds were upto the vision extent, making it unforgettable\
  \ moment. At the peak, we came upon unexpectedly couple of youtubers making photographs\
  \ and video footage for their youtube channel. And being initial vlogger, I collaborated\
  \ with them regarding travel vlogs. \nNow, we caught our glance at another talisman\
  \ peak, far away from our position and decided to chase it. This was the robust\
  \ part of trekking as we have to pass through grass, bushes, plains and steeper\
  \ path. This unyielding path almost drained our energy. At any rate, we arrived\
  \ on this top in next 2.5hrs. At this peak we found ourselves in the state of being\
  \ relaxed and observed the nature. There were some locals playing cricket on the\
  \ top, we joined them as am really captivated of it. There were remains of a historical\
  \ building that depicting the impermanent nature of living and non-living matter.\
  \ Then we had some rest, ate the apple, got some energy and decided to come back,\
  \ it was already 2:30pm.\nUnfortunately, we lost the track and scattered in the\
  \ hills. Moreover, roamed for about 4hrs but couldn\u2019t find the way. We were\
  \ stunned and fearful as it was about to dark and cell phones were out of power.\
  \ We sat in anxiety to ponder upon the solution and heard a voice of goat. Following\
  \ the voice, we saw a small home approximately 200m below from our position. Having\
  \ no other means, we contacted the resident in home by shouting and he guided us\
  \ to the home. In spite of our critical mental depression and physical weakness\
  \ he was unable to offer us residence. On the request of his grandmother, he was\
  \ ready to lead us to the starting point. The old village resident guided us to\
  \ the steepest path. It was dark, fear aroused inside our souls being alone with\
  \ an unknown person. We prayed the God almighty by remembering our good deeds in\
  \ the past.\nIn the mean time a horrible incident occurred when moving on a tail\
  \ along hills on left side and abyssus on right, my friend slipped and fell upto\
  \ a depth of 15m. Luckily, he grasped bushes to withstand on a fairy level place.\
  \ Anyhow, we rescued him by particular planning. It was a moment we had to take\
  \ rest as he was trembling and shivering continuously. By eating fruit (got from\
  \ villager\u2019s home) gathered some strength and moved on. \nThere was a waterfall\
  \ on the way. \u201Ccross it carefully otherwise you will be flown away by water\
  \ thrust\u201D, he warned us. Crossed that way by holding hands of each other. Finally,\
  \ it took 3hrs to reach at the starting point. We thanked God, offered money to\
  \ the old man as a reward but he refused by saying, \u201CI love serving people\u201D\
  . We stayed in the hotel at night and came back university in the morning."
