Text: "I had no idea what I was doing. It could have been a sort of psychotic break\
  \ for all I know that my friends wanted to indulge me in. My two best friends were\
  \ torn: one of them professed that what I was doing was a bad idea. The other? Well\u2026\
  \ he wanted to be a part of it. \nMy life had self-destructed. I had broken up with\
  \ my ex, I got laid off from my job, and my lease was about to be up on my apartment.\
  \ I had enjoyed a brief period of what some people call \u201Cnormalcy\u201D, but\
  \ I should know by now that my life is anything but. Its days were numbered. I should\
  \ have known. Yet here I was with no plan after the crashing disillusion that was\
  \ not to be my life. \nThe death of a friend provided no consolation on that either.\
  \ That was the last time that my one best friend, Adam, had come down from Canada\
  \ along with some others I had never met before for the funeral. One of them was\
  \ Adam\u2019s childhood friend. He and I spoke at length about travel and the like\
  \ as he had been a traveling engineer and about his wife who owned an organic farm\
  \ west of Seattle. He mentioned a sort of farming internship that she runs, and\
  \ we joked about ditching the life I had for one in verdant pastures and pastoral\
  \ intent. We laughed and laughed and laughed\u2026.\nBut I wasn\u2019t laughing\
  \ now. Not with my life in shambles shortly after this incident. \nAll I had was\
  \ a crazy idea to take this internship Adam\u2019s friend recommended on his wife\u2019\
  s farm \u2013 3200 miles away. After downing a bottle of wine with him via Skype\
  \ one night and telling him about this, his propensity for delighting and helping\
  \ me act out my bad ideas bloomed in glory. \u201CI will fly down there and we will\
  \ take that 3200-mile road trip together, buddy.\u201D It was a tempting offer.\
  \ I really had nothing else holding me here. \u201CTake the ride!\u201D he kept\
  \ saying, repeating it over and over like a cheer. His childlike excitement flavored\
  \ and fueled my own will at that moment when I truly had none. I made the only choice\
  \ there was to make. I agreed. \nThe next morning I was on the phone, packing suitcases,\
  \ and closing the business I had started with friends several years ago. It was\
  \ already dead; I simply needed the death certificate to ensure I wasn\u2019t going\
  \ to be taxed that year. I closed down all of my affairs, said goodbye plenty of\
  \ times to plenty of people. Then Adam and I took off up I75 on a balmy mid-July\
  \ morning.\nI took a leap out of a window that was already broken, yet would I have\
  \ leaped without someone encouraging me to move forward? The glass was sharp and\
  \ treacherous. What if I cut myself? What if I didn\u2019t truly want to take this\
  \ ride? All of these questions popped into my head as I took the steering wheel\
  \ with everything I owned in the back of my SUV.\nI looked over to the man that\
  \ had been at my side through these past 10 years. We look so much alike that introducing\
  \ him as my brother would have raised no question. So much so that I know the mischievous\
  \ smile when it creeps onto his face: it was one of sheer excitement, the anticipation\
  \ of the road ahead. I remember my face having that smile once. I looked at the\
  \ dotted yellow lines passing by and then that smile again. \u201CAdam,\u201D I\
  \ began. \u201CDo you think I\u2019m crazy?\u201D \n\u201CPsht, duh!\u201D he replied\
  \ without hesitation. \u201CBut you didn\u2019t think I was gonna\u2019 let you\
  \ have all the insane fun, did you?\u201D That smile again.\n\u201COf course not.\
  \ I know better.\u201D I felt a smile curl onto my face. Something I hadn\u2019\
  t felt in some time. It was then that this leap whispered a promise: to start anew\
  \ and relinquish the old. It was about time to release everything that I had outgrown\
  \ to replace with new."
