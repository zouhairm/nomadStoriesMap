Text: "Whenever I travel to Chiapas my family knows that it\u2019s a must for me to\
  \ go to \u201CEl Ca\xF1on del Sumidero.\u201D Ever since I was a little girl, I\
  \ fathomed the marvelous sight, the tall canyons, the river and the crocodiles that\
  \ remind me of how minuscule I am in comparison.\_\nEverything was going according\
  \ to plan. The beauty of the canyons mesmerized my nieces, my brothers\_and I reminisced\
  \ our childhood, and my parents and uncle couldn\u2019t stop smiling and pointing\
  \ out fun facts about the place.\_\nAfter the delightful ride, we continued walking\
  \ around Chiapa de Corzo and trying the wonderful tasty food. We decided to eat\
  \ before going home since the drive was long. Once we finished eating, it was time\
  \ to go. \u201CI\u2019ll come again,\u201D I thought with watery eyes. If only I\
  \ knew what was about to happen, I would have convinced my parents to stay one more\
  \ day.\_\nAbout halfway, I commenced to get anxious; I knew that something would\_\
  happen because whenever I get a distressed feeling there is a bad outcome. I told\
  \ myself to calm down and stop overreacting. And then, it occurred. Pouring rain,\
  \ falling on the windshield, becoming faster.\_\nNormally, I\u2019m fond of rain,\
  \ and even more so when is pouring. There\u2019s a mystical feeling whenever the\
  \ sky blesses us with water. In that instant though, it seemed like the gods resented\
  \ humanity; the rain was piercing the car making difficult for my dad to see the\
  \ road.\_\nThe thunder made my nieces cry, and with that, everyone became distressed.\
  \ My dad has experience with driving in the rain, fog and even fire, hence I didn\u2019\
  t get scared. However, we couldn\u2019t see my uncle\u2019s car\_behind us. At that\
  \ moment, I imagined a thousand outlooks. Keeping myself positive was difficult\
  \ with the crying and the unspoken tension that surrounded me. But somehow, I could\
  \ speak, \u201CStop the car, let\u2019s wait for my uncle to catch up,\u201D I told\
  \ my dad.\_\nMinutes passed, and with each one, I got more and more uneasy. I looked\
  \ around every five seconds, but all I could see where the mountains and the surrounding\
  \ greenery. In other circumstances I would\u2019ve been in awe by the thrilling\
  \ view; how the fog and the rain made the trees and the road somehow mystical like\
  \ we were entering a dystopian novel.\_\nAfter what seemed like hours, we spotted\
  \ the tiny red car with my brothers and uncle. My oldest brother got out of the\
  \ car and came running to the van. \u201CMy uncle got scared, he almost couldn\u2019\
  t drive with all the rain.\u201D He told us a little shaky.\_\nAround half an hour\
  \ later of waiting, the rain stopped. It was getting dark, and the agitation was\
  \ still present, but somehow, after all the complications and delays, we got home\
  \ in one piece."
