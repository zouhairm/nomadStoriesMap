Text: "Just a year ago, my friends and I visited Bali, the most fascinating island\
  \ among the best of Indonesia. I got there just in the purpose of study trip. Although\
  \ I am Indonesian, that was the first time for me to visit what Indonesian called\
  \ the Island of foreign tourists because scares in my minds often did not allow\
  \ me to go by ships - oceans scared me. In order to get peace in our mind, as usual,\
  \ we prayed before going. \nWe arrived in Bali at 3.00 AM after travelling for about\
  \ one day. It took so long due to our intention to drop for a while in Education\
  \ Authorities of Surabaya. That mattered a lot to our experiences as teacher candidates.\
  \ \nPanglipuran village was the first time we were interested in to observe Balinese\
  \ culture. Interaction between foreign tourists and villagers was another important\
  \ point that we wanted to learn. Some communication strategies could be seen in\
  \ their conversations such as mumbling, topic avoidance, appeals for help, using\
  \ mother language, and the like, since Bali was multilingual place and the villagers\
  \ are lack of English mastery. However, most foreign tourists could speak in Indonesian\
  \ language so there was no big misunderstanding happened. \nPendidikan Bali Asia\
  \ was the next institution we spent our time in. No more than that that institution\
  \ got many medals for its professionals in education, we got, as we had seats far\
  \ away from the representative speaker in the welcoming ceremony in a hall of a\
  \ mall. It was just worse as we were figuratively dying because of starving. \n\
  The next fun happened on the next day in Pandawa beach where some of my friends\
  \ said that somebody would find his/her mate and get married soon when he/she prayed\
  \ there. It was not easy for me to believe it because I was sure that many girls\
  \ out there were waiting for me to propose. Some of us were having fun in the cool\
  \ blue water with the wonderful dancing ocean waves. The others including me were\
  \ just having talks in a little cafe in the bank of the desert-like thing near the\
  \ bus parking, about how weird we were to arbitrarily play around in the water like\
  \ child although I was sick of that drivel and really wanted to join in the beach.\
  \ Nobody was alone except one of my friend who just slept in the bus. He told me\
  \ that without his girlfriend trip was just a sleep. \nThe coolest moment happened\
  \ on the third day in a hall with a beautiful stage. We were watching Tari Kecak,\
  \ one of traditional dances in Bali. My friends told me that the show was just so\
  \ amazing which I regretted to miss. My stomach seemed to be protective of me, did\
  \ not prohibit me to see that thing, and send me into a bathroom near the show hall.\
  \ It could be tolerated anyway because I was not into such traditional dance. \n\
  The next section of the trip was about exploring what people called Jimbaran beach.\
  \ That was the last destination we had in Bali and, in my opinion, the most picturesque\
  \ beach among Segara, Sanur, Kuta, Pandawa, Dreamland and other beaches in Bali.\
  \ Accompanied by stars in the night and a song from Camila Cabello \u201CHavana,\u201D\
  \ my mind was flying away, avoiding the crowdedness of the-last-night party which\
  \ was intentionally held to familiarize us, considering that we were going to graduate\
  \ for about a year later. Only waves grazing my feet, sweeping sands happily swing\
  \ on my leg hair, appeased my heart, erased my longing for my family and disturbed\
  \ me from my dream of that someday my family and I could be there together. I could\
  \ not stand my intention to play there with my lovely sister and brother. I could\
  \ not wait any longer to try Balinese food with them. And that day, I believed,\
  \ would come soon."
