Text: "The Lion city.\nThe Garden city.\nThe Red Dot.\nThe Crossroads of the Orient.\n\
  All these names refer to one location: Singapore.\nOne of the most amazing cities\
  \ in South-East Asia.\nThe Republic of Singapore is a sovereign and democratic state,\
  \ which has become an independent nation after its separation from Malaysia, in\
  \ 1965.\nA multicultural blend of Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Western human beings\
  \ living in this exciting developed, western-like, well-organized city. Warm atmosphere,\
  \ colors, clean streets, avant-garde architecture, art, respect for nature, welcoming\
  \ educated people, well-functioning public transport system, delicious food, high\
  \ street shopping, and so much more. \nHaving a few days here is difficult because\
  \ everywhere you look around, there's an interesting spot ready to inspire your\
  \ eyes. \nMagic happens anyway.\n\nSingapore's Changi Airport warmly welcomes you\
  \ with a great sense of tranquility,  genuine smiley faces, art installations such\
  \ as the famous Kinetic Rain, the world's largest kinetic art sculpture, and so\
  \ much more.\nThe transport system is perfectly functioning, but the decision goes\
  \ to take a taxi and go to the hotel (Swissotel The Stamford is a recommended, affordable\
  \ 5*  accommodation, close to the airport, perfect central position).\nEyes on the\
  \ road, eyes up to the sky, while the wind gently kisses your face. \nAnd then,\
  \ suddenly, incredulous eyes on a jaw-dropping innovative building called Marina\
  \ Bay Sands, a stunning architectural visual pleasure, perfect from every angle\
  \ which it's seen.\n\nIndeed, the first attraction is the Marina Bay Sands, the\
  \ integrated resort fronting Marina Bay.\nNot just exclusive accommodation. \nBut\
  \ a 5* luxury experience, with three columns, dancing up to the sky and gently sloping\
  \ to bow down to the harmonious art of feng shui, supporting the majestic ship-shaped\
  \ structure on the 57th floor. This incredible rooftop embraces the world's largest\
  \ rooftop Infinity Pool, the SkyPark Observation Deck, restaurants and bars.\nDon't\
  \ worry if you cannot afford to swim at sky-level, you can simply enjoy the stunning\
  \ 360-degree view of Singapore skyline. Very recommended.\nMarina Bay Sands, welcomes\
  \ also a Casino, theatre shows, stores, and more.\nPlus, near Marina Bay Sands you\
  \ can also shop at the Louis Vuitton Marina Bay, a store on the water and the brand's\
  \ first Island Maison.\nMoreover, just by the complex, it is located ArtScience\
  \ Museum, with its superb lotus flower design of the building.\nNot so far from\
  \ Marina Bay Sands, curious eyes meet one the most stunning places on earth, Gardens\
  \ by the Bay.\nAn incredible spectacular futuristic park featuring: the Supertree\
  \ Grove, giant man-made tree structures embraced by the panoramic Skyway; the outdoor\
  \ peaceful Garden; the unique Flower Dome with the world's largest selection of\
  \ flowers from every corner of the planet, all gently inside this immense glass\
  \ greenhouse; the Sun Pavillon; Art Sculptures creating a connection between humanity,\
  \ creativity and nature; and the jaw-dropping view of the indoor vertical garden\
  \ called Cloud Forest. At night, Gardens by the Bay puts on its best dress and shines\
  \ with the sublime light show, carrying you into another dimension, as if you were\
  \ inside 'Avatar' movie colors and shades. \nAn unforgettable place, with unique\
  \ colors and a sustainable structure. One of a kind.\n\nAfter the excitement of\
  \ this impressive park, take a walk from the stunning waterside Clarke Quay to Merlion\
  \ Park, where you can spend some quality time admiring the famous Merlion, the iconic\
  \ statue of a mythical creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish,\
  \ watching the night incredible light show from Marina Bay Sands.\nBesides the Chinese\
  \ district of Chinatown, there's also Little India, an incredible spot where you\
  \ can find nice shops, typical flavors, colonial buildings, full-colored houses,\
  \ temples, and precious atmospheres.\n\nAnd then, the last attraction.\nSingapore\
  \ Botanic Gardens is a stunning collection of over 60,000 orchids, gingers, palms,\
  \ and cycads. Colors of every type of flowers, a peaceful atmosphere,  grace surrounding\
  \ your whole body during a morning walk through the magical paths. This is a UNESCO\
  \ world heritage site and it also represents the world 's largest orchid display.\n\
  A sublime sensation for your eyes\nIt's really hard to leave this dynamic city because\
  \ this beauty queen is cosmopolitan, sustainable, clean, avant-garde and seriously\
  \ inspiring. \nCiao, Singapore!"
