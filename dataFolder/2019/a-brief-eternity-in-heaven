Text: "I deserve a Darwin Award. Out of all the very bad ideas I\u2019ve had, this\
  \ one was by far the worst. I didn\u2019t tell any of my friends where I was going.\
  \ And, hoping to avoid the two hours hiking trail back, alone and starving, I threw\
  \ myself into the sea in hopes that swimming back to Fortaleza beach would be faster\
  \ than walking. But it is not. I can\u2019t see any beaches. Only rocks. And the\
  \ beautiful tropical trees beneath them, thirty feet above me.\n\nAt this point,\
  \ I don\u2019t know what else to do. I\u2019ve tried the four cardinal points. Swimming\
  \ north seemed like a good idea at first, but I now realize it\u2019s far, far away.\
  \ Gosh! Of course it\u2019s far away: two hours hiking! Swimming south, back to\
  \ the trail, where the little seashore I passed by moments before throwing myself\
  \ into the sea is not working: the tide is very strong. No matter how hard I swim,\
  \ I stay in the same spot, right beneath this amazing Ip\xEA tree. No, I\u2019ll\
  \ not try to swim east to high sea, it\u2019ll only increase my risk of drowning\
  \ or to be run over by a motorboat, despite the fact that no boats passed by in\
  \ the last hour. Actually, I have no clue of how long have I been adrift now. Seems\
  \ like an eternity. I tried, of course, to climb the west rocks, from where I threw\
  \ myself at sea. But the moment I set my right foot on one of the rocks full of\
  \ sharp mussels, a wave took away my sandal and I sustained a deep cut. Now, I\u2019\
  m bleeding. Nothing could be worst, right? In the future, a friend will tell me\
  \ that this sea is full of sharks, but right now, bleeding and without the shark\
  \ information, I am desperate enough.\n\nThe sea is getting rougher and rougher.\
  \ I am exhausted, feeling hurt, hopeless, floating, drifting, lying still as a plank.\
  \ I close my eyes.\n\nWhat else can I do? I hear the amazing atlantic forest tree\
  \ leaves moving with the wind. I feel the freshness of the water. I hear some birds.\
  \ I feel the warmth of the sun in my face. I hear the sound of the waves hitting\
  \ the rocks nearby. A loud sound. But beautiful. And I am pretty sure I\u2019m already\
  \ in heaven. Maybe I am lucky if die here, this way, right now. My despair vanished.\n\
  \nFor a second, at least, just before hearing a different sound echoing in the rocks.\n\
  It\u2019s approaching.\nIt\u2019s a familiar sound.\nA motor sound!\nI boost myself\
  \ out of the water to see... an inflatable grey boat! The waves just let me see\
  \ a glimpse of it before pulling me down again. It turned off it\u2019s noisy motor\
  \ and stopped less than half a mile away! In the future, I\u2019ll learn that the\
  \ boat was sent by angels and stopped for no reason other than just save me. But\
  \ right now, I have to think fast: I can swim east to reach it, but the guys in\
  \ it would probably not see me and leave before I got there. I\u2019ll be left behind\
  \ at  high sea and in a worse situation. Or I can just wave my hands when in the\
  \ highest point of the waves, and scream.\n\u201CHELP!\u201D The drumming sound\
  \ of the waves hitting the rocks is not helping.\n\u201CHEEEEELP!\u201D But I still\
  \ have some energy left right now.\n\u201CHEEEEEEEELLLLPPP!\u201D Those guys are\
  \ now looking in my direction. Right? Maybe I could wait all day for the next boat,\
  \ to do it all again in case this one fails to see me. But I feel it\u2019s my last\
  \ chance and it has to happen now!\n\u201CHEEEEEEEELLLLPPPLEEEEAAASE!\u201D\n\n\
  In a blink of an eye, I\u2019m inside the boat. Unbelievable! The two guys tell\
  \ me they stopped just to open a beer can, and they never do such a thing. They\
  \ miraculously heard my screams among the louder sea sounds. And made an effort\
  \ to believe that little dot waving among the waves was a person. \u201CWant a drink?\u201D\
  \ I usually don\u2019t drink but \u201CYES! A Skol for my life!\u201D"
