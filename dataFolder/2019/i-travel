  \ to Coorg, nice,peaceful, and positive place. Where I explored the beauty of nature\
  \ as well as human kind. We are working daily to earn money to live a luxury life\
  \ but here I felt more royal without investing lot . Food was healthy , environment\
  \ was healthy, mind was so positive at that moment when I sat for an hour with my\
  \ husband , without any aocial updates   yes! First time in a while I felt I don't\
  \ need to post anything . I was enjoying every little moment over there being on\
