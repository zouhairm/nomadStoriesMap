Text: "Mrs Kadam mixed a teaspoon of sugar in the boiling pan of tea placed right\
  \ in front of her gas stove in fuschia. As I observed this unusual combination,\
  \ I was amused to encounter a piece of equipment which is usually associated with\
  \ burning flames painted in an interesting shade of pink.\n\n I looked around the\
  \ one roomed-house situated in a busy community of Dapodi in Pune, India where Mrs\
  \ Kadam lives with one of her sons and husband and pays 35 rupees to clear the monthly\
  \ rent. The walls were enveloped in the darkest of pink as the front door complemented\
  \ them by showcasing several shades of blue. \n\u201CThis wall is made of mud\u201D\
  , said Mrs Kadam pointing at the edges. \u201COur family has been living here for\
  \ the past 20 years. We have the house painted in different colours because we like\
  \ it this way. The colours make it look vibrant and hides those parts of the walls\
  \ that have been ruined by the rains and water system. We paint these walls on our\
  \ own and along with that we also paint the doors and a lot many other things found\
  \ in the house. It just makes everything look lively\u201D, she added. Responding\
  \ to the query of not choosing bland colours like off-white or a lighter version\
  \ of pink and yellow usually found in urban buildings of India, she said, \u201C\
  That is too boring. The darker shades make our house look more beautiful.\u201D\n\
  \nAs I walked out of her residence, I found a similar pattern of buildings and doors\
  \ painted in darker shades of blue, pink, teal, sea green, orange, purple, and yellow\
  \ across the community.\n \u201CEveryone paints their own houses and shops here\u201D\
  , said Mrs Kamble, another resident of the community. \u201CWe like the darker shades\
  \ of the colour and we paint every part of the walls in different colours because\
  \ it looks beautiful to look at\u201D, she added as she showed the shelves of her\
  \ walls coloured in darker shades of green in contrary to the outer area of her\
  \ residence painted in indigo and aqua colours. The interesting culture of painting\
  \ buildings and objects in a variety of colours seemed to house a billion voices\
  \ of Dapodi that move towards the beginning of a trend that has been subconsciously\
  \ created in their lives.\n\nThis \u2018paint culture\u2019, however, is not rooted\
  \ in Dapodi alone but has been found signifying spirits of vibrancy across several\
  \ communities in India, out of which most of them are low-income. I have travelled\
  \ to 7 clusters of communities in Pune alone that resort to painting residents,\
  \ shops, and sometimes even vehicles. The residents of the communities like what\
  \ the spirit of the colours has to offer.\n\nAs many communities in Pune like Bopodi,\
  \ Dapodi, Dapodi village, Khadki Bazaar, Yerwada, Peth Area, and Hadapsar Area are\
  \ resolving the issues emerging from cleanliness and hygiene by painting their properties\
  \ in various skies and rainbows, the long acquired culture marks a subconscious\
  \ collective effort of commencing positive urbanism. The life that the colours add\
  \ to every element of the communities is everything that forms its premises on the\
  \ very heart of positivity. The pattern has been found symbolic of growth, happiness,\
  \ and confidence, in many slum-based and low-income communities of Pune. This impactful\
  \ concept validates for a number of households and enterprises the joy the colours\
  \ entail and has been rooted in their communal culture forever and a day.\n\nI am\
  \ at loss of words number every time I look at the vibrant envelope of resilience\
  \ immersed in the towns that I travel to. At one of the sunsets in Khadki Bazar\
  \ in Pune when I stepped on the stones bordered with crooked walls, and doors that\
  \ had been left ajar, I saw a wave infused with unusual patterns of an unidentified\
  \ rainbow, that ran over the streets paving stepping stones for vibrant urbanism\
  \ in the town."
