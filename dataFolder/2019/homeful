Text: "After a series of unfortunate events; mass family death, an abortion I wanted\
  \ to keep, a few suicide attempts, and moving to the mountains to have my room sold\
  \ right out from under me, I took a leap of faith. \nVery unlike The Revenant, where\
  \ you just keep hoping his life will get better, I believe mine has. I may be homeless,\
  \ living out of my car until I can save enough for a camper or build enough credit\
  \ for an apartment, but I am very blessed. I have a fun job with amazing coworkers,\
  \ I have an amazing boyfriend (who, though blind, tells me how beautiful I am everyday)\
  \ and I live in a wonderful place where Incan adventure everyday. \nBeing in the\
  \ professional climbing industry isn\u2019t as glorious as large companies like\
  \ to make it seem with their all-star athletes. I came to the industry looking to\
  \ write real stories, and now I\u2019m living one. With a boyfriend who\u2019s title\
  \ is \u201CWorld Champion,\u201D in ParaClimbing, even he is struggling just to\
  \ get his sponsors to afford him the competitions they require him to participate\
  \ in. Needless to say, someone with a mission to help people struggling with depression\
  \ can\u2019t get companies to afford even publishing one article that hits real\
  \ subjects, because, \u201CPeople want to read what backpack to carry, not about\
  \ people who newly blew their brains out.\u201D \nSo, yeah, my story is a continuous\
  \ leap of faith; faith in finding a way, faith in the unknown, and faith for life.\
  \ \nI know I was allotted twice the space for writing here, but honestly, if a synopsis\
  \ like mine doesn\u2019t grab your attention, a few more paragraphs won\u2019t make\
  \ a difference. \nstay positive. \nxoxo"
