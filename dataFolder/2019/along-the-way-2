  \ life.  As a solo traveler, I have the luxury of taking my time and talking with\
  \ the people I encounter along the way.  It\u2019s the workers I\u2019m interested\
  \ in, the people that most travelers ignore; the ones that clean the hotel rooms,\
  \ the bus boys, the drivers.  \u201CHow long have you worked here?\u201D \u201C\
  How long do you work in a day?\u201D \u201C How long does it take you to get to\
  \ work?\u201D The answers are usually humbling.  Making local connections is one\
  \ of my main reasons for traveling. \n\nI am enjoying a \u2018gap year\u2019, but\
  \ not the kind young adults take between high school and college or right after\
  \ college. My gap year is between being old and being too old to travel. I\u2019\
  ve been traveling since mid November. I started by taking Teaching English as a\
  \ Foreign Language Class in Prague, and then did some volunteering in Poland and\
  \ Hungary. Exhausting my Schengen zone Visa, I am now in Sri Lanka. Finishing a\
  \ week of volunteering, I am now touring the country meeting people.  \n\nI am from\
  \ the great state of Alaska. In most countries, that in it self is enough to start\
  \ a conversation.  In the Czech Republic I enlisted the help of the hotel receptionist\
  \ to mail a package to the US. In the course of our trip to the post office, he\
  \ discovered that I was from Alaska.  Years ago, he had been an exchange student\
  \ in a small, Native village in Southeast Alaska. He couldn\u2019t stop talking\
  \ about it. It was an experience, both frightening and enriching, that changed his\
  \ life. He said it was such a pleasure to finally be able to share his story with\
  \ someone that had the context to understand what he had been through. \n\nIn Hungary\
  \ I met a young girl from Nepal that was cleaning hotel rooms. She was 23 and had\
  \ been gone from home for 5 years. She worked 12hour shifts. Most of the money she\
  \ made, she sent home to her parents and brother who could not find work.  She was\
  \ looking forward to returning home within a year because her parents had found\
  \ a suitable husband for her. I asked if she was pleased. \u201COf course!\u201D\
  \ she replied. \u201CI would never have the time and energy to find a suitable mate,\
  \ I am so happy my parents have found someone for me, I can\u2019t wait to meet\
  \ him and start my life as a wife.\u201D I was in awe at her contentment, so different\
  \ of our Western ideas of romance. \n\nIn Sri Lanka, I befriended another hotel\
  \ worker. She was 72 years old and had been working at the same hotel for 35 years.\
  \  \u201CWhat else can I do?\u201D she explained.  Her husband had left for the\
  \ Middle East many years ago and she never heard from him again. Her only son died\
  \ in the tsunami of 2004. She stopped her cleaning and sat on my bed as she described\
  \ the terror of that day. Her son had been living in Galle, where the wave hit.\
  \ She waited for days to hear from him, but never did. He was never found. She lives\
  \ alone. There is no one to help her; her only choice is to keep working.  She wiped\
  \ away the tears, smiled and started making up the bed. \n\nMy life continues to\
  \ be enriched by the people and stories I encounter along the way."
