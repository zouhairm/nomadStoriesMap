Text: "In October 2014 I visited India for the first time with my mother as part of\
  \ my 18th birthday.\nAfter stops at Delhi, Agra, and Jodhpur, we made our way to\
  \ Udaipur - the Rajasthani city famous for its water palace. While I spent my days\
  \ exploring the country with my mother, at night I would sit in the hotel\u2019\
  s business room for long hours, working on my university applications.\n\nThe Udaipur\
  \ hotel did not have a business room, which is why I sat at a computer behind the\
  \ reception desk, right next to the porter. The first night, he would be there only\
  \ occasionally, leading to some amusing situations where late-night hotel guests\
  \ mistook me for a staff member and asked me for their keys, which I had the pleasure\
  \ to hand out a couple of times. On the second night however, I got to talk a bit\
  \ more with Shiv, as he was called. Shiv was originally from Jaipur, Rajasthan's\
  \ largest city, and moved to Udaipur for his job. He told me a bit about life in\
  \ India, and how vibrant the many festivals are.\n\nCoincidentally, as we stayed\
  \ in Udaipur, the Navaratri, also known as the \u201CNine Nights Festival\u201D\
  , was taking place. Shiv told me that it would be a great opportunity for me to\
  \ witness Indian culture, and offered to take me there after his shift. Always eager\
  \ to experience new things, I readily took him up on the offer, and sure enough\
  \ at midnight he came down to pick me up. \n\nWe talked a few blocks down to his\
  \ apartment, where he stayed together with some other hotel employees. After he\
  \ changed into more casual attire, we went back out on the street, where a friend\
  \ of his was waiting. He sat in a bright-red open-top jeep with a Coca Cola logo\
  \ painted on the sides. While slightly perplexed at what I was seeing, I was only\
  \ all the more intrigued. This is where the fun actually began to unravel.\n\nThe\
  \ festival grounds, located in the middle of the city, were about a fifteen minute\
  \ drive away. Suffice it to say that this was probably the craziest ride in my life\
  \ so far. The jeep was not particularly big, but when trying to manoeuver through\
  \ the narrow side streets of an Indian city, there rarely were more than a couple\
  \ of inches to spare on either side. We even had oncoming traffic a couple of times,\
  \ and to this day I\u2019m not quite sure how we got past that.\n\nOnce we reached\
  \ the festival grounds I slowly started to realize what I was getting myself into:\
  \ thousands of people were gathered in a small square, waiting for the ceremonies\
  \ to start. Shiv led me past the crowds, close to the podium on which some kind\
  \ of awards ceremony was taking place. After all of that was said and done, upon\
  \ a sign from Shiv, one of the elders on the podium urged me to come up. While not\
  \ quite sure what helped me to this honor, I followed his plea, and took a cross-legged\
  \ seat next to him. Luckily, I brought my camera, allowing me to capture the ensuing\
  \ festivities. \n\nNavaratri is largely nocturnal, and finds its culmination in\
  \ its grand nightly dances. Hundreds of people form two giant circles, and perform\
  \ a musical dance with wooden sticks in which dancers constantly switch partners.\
  \ This ceremony goes on for more than hour, after which the celebrations subside\
  \ and recommence the next day. Awe is the best word to describe my experience, for\
  \ no grand imagery can truly capture the feeling of being immersed in something\
  \ so fantastic yet so sincere as I saw taking place at this particular moment and\
  \ place.\n\nAfterwards, I reunited with Shiv and his friends, and they brought me\
  \ back home again. Leaving Udaipur the next day and India two days later, I parted\
  \ with the country on a true highpoint, and managed to stay in touch with Shiv ever\
  \ since. It is without a doubt a travelling experience I will never forget, and\
  \ easily the first one that comes to mind when I think of an extraordinary story."
