Text: "As it was school holidays, though short and rainy, I decided it would be good\
  \ to drag some beauties up north to educate the locals on the true fabulousness\
  \ of teachers on break.\nScotland is one of my favourite mixtures of old and new\
  \ world and though it was the first place I travelled to on my own years ago, I\
  \ still find myself coming back and, more often than not, dragging others with me.\
  \ I found it surprising that the two UK residents on the trip had never made it\
  \ so far north before and it was so much fun playing tour guide in Edinburgh! Imagine:\
  \ an Irish-looking Aussie leading the British rabble around. \u2018Over here is\
  \ the Heart of Midlothian which marks the spot of the Old Tolbooth, in this case,\
  \ a prison. Locals still occasionally spit on the heart \u2018for luck\u2019. Or\
  \ possibly just to freak out the tourists\u2026\u2019\nBeing in Scotland and on\
  \ holiday, we were obliged to sample a few drinking houses, and took any and all\
  \ recommendations offered by the locals we met. Separated by the rail system, an\
  \ enormous park that was once a dumping ground for Edinburgh waste, and more than\
  \ a few bodies, and a gothic monolith that looks epic in rain or sun, the Old and\
  \ New Towns of Edinburgh present visitors with two very different experiences. \n\
  Travelling through the Old Town, down the Royal Mile with a \u2018Pirate\u2019s\
  \ of The Caribbean\u2019 mega-fan, we stopped for lunch in the World\u2019s End\
  \ Pub for a chicken trio burger and a cider, of course. Pre-dinner drinks were at\
  \ a cosy whisky bar five minutes walk from South Bridge, called The Royal McGregor-\
  \ bar staff here are whiskey experts and very kind to beginners, they only laughed\
  \ a little at our reactions to the different whiskeys. \nIn the New Town, there\
  \ is a different vibe in the streets. More young locals spend their Friday and Saturday\
  \ nights on this side of town, coming in from the fringes of Edinburgh to visit\
  \ the quirky, constantly evolving bars, restaurants and clubs spotted between Princes\
  \ St and Queens St. Cocktails trump beers, though whiskey is still a staple. Mini\
  \ dresses with knee high boots are more common than tourists. Being teachers, we\
  \ had to make a stop at The Queens Arms to appreciate the library-esque setting\
  \ with its walls lined with books, deep, leather armchairs cloistered around tables\
  \ and, perversely, local live bands playing until all hours. On the advice of a\
  \ local, we dropped into Dirty Dick\u2019s. I was sceptical- the place is small\
  \ and crammed with odd bits and pieces from around the world. I wasn\u2019t a fan\
  \ of the creepy clown dolls, but neither was the original owners\u2019 daughter,\
  \ or so the story goes. The regular canine visitors as well as excellent bar staff,\
  \ however, made the trip worthwhile. It\u2019s definitely something to see!\nDigging\
  \ up the past is a hobby we four teachers have become somewhat morbidly fascinated\
  \ with. As such, we embarked on what turned out to be a particularly funny \u2018\
  historical\u2019 local ghost tour, starting at Starbucks, passing through the \u2018\
  top rated graveyard in Edinburgh\u2019 and an alley where an undead woman is said\
  \ to live. Unfortunately, the sun had yet to go down so some stories didn\u2019\
  t quite have the spook factor our guide was going for, but it was a good way to\
  \ spend an evening. We did learn, however, that the Scots attempted to built themselves\
  \ a coliseum as they were once considered 'the Rome of Europe', mostly by themselves.\
  \ Unfortunately, shipping enormous slabs of sandstone from warmer climates takes\
  \ a toll on the pocket and whoever it was, I suspect the universities, ran out of\
  \ money. The half built grand coliseum stands on the hill by the observatory and\
  \ looks charmingly out of place up there.\nMy only wish would have been to have\
  \ stayed longer, but that is nothing new.\nA good time was had by all, one pound\
  \ bills were collected, alcohol was consumed and laughs were had.\nUntil next time\
  \ Scotland! You know I'll be back."
