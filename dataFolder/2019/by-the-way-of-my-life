Text: "There are many different ways to understand, explain or discover the unknown.\
  \ Usually we are so scared when  there is something new. The changes make us feeling\
  \ a little bit anxious or sadbecause we prefer to have the control situation, is\
  \ more comfortable whenever wouldn't know what to do because we've lived this before.\
  \ Our brains spend less energy to repeat an action then to think or change a behavior.\
  \ That is the reason it is so hard to turn bad  habits into good ones.  When we\
  \ had born everything is unexplored.  The knowledge starts through the basic and\
  \ the simple things slowly. we grow up and we usually have to stimulate a lot of\
  \ things and we cannot waste time because everything goes very fast. Sometimes it\
  \ is like we lost the pleasure in the process of the knowledge creation. The growth\
  \ is the bridge between the unknown to the knowledge. \nSince I was a child I'm\
  \ so curious about the things that I don't know. in my vacation I used to visit\
  \ the place that I don't know anyone or anything. And there was two times that I've\
  \ been in two countries. My first experience was in Toronto,Canada, I spend a month\
  \ and another time I've been in Santiago, Chile, I spend only two weeks. The both\
  \ trips were so amazing because of I've by myself in a different place and I do\
  \ a lot of things  you should think that I'm can't do it and I make some special\
  \ friends. I fell in love for Toronto at the moment that I put my feets in the airport.\
  \ \nThe first time that I've been the underground was in Toronto and it is so different\
  \ the reality of my country. And it was so easy because there are a lot of maps\
  \ by all of the stations and if you are lost you may ask someone to do a street\
  \ and they stop what did they are doing to help, you that's amazing. Toronto there\
  \ are many good places to visit, put in different neighborhoods like Chinatown,little\
  \ Portugal, Little Italy,  and in this cosmopolitan city you have a lot of different\
  \ food to eat . A situation that I will never forget, I've been in the mall with\
  \ my two friends we had visited the little Portugal and then we go to the mall Eaton\
  \ Center. It was 5:15 a clock and we didn't eat lunch, we are so hungry then I saw\
  \ a Greek restaurant. There the waitress gave us the menu, in there was a word that\
  \ I didn't recognize the translate to Portuguese. I asked to do waitress what means\
  \ lamp and she did the imitated a sound of a lamb. I love the people who live in\
  \ Toronto, they care for the others,even if they are foreigners.\n My experience\
  \ in Santiago was more difficult than Toronto, because I do not speak Spanish. I\
  \ understood what they were saying, but I didn't know how to answer. The most important\
  \ to me when I travel alone is learn about myself. It is amazing when you have a\
  \ chance to complete a challenge and you do it well. But you don't need to go to\
  \ another country to discover yourself how about you know, for example, if you read\
  \ a book that usually don't, this is a way. Somethings you have to try by yourself\
  \ if you want know what is the feeling. \nHowever when I was young I used to say\
  \ that I will have a lot of money to travel around the world. Some feelings are\
  \ born and belong to your soul. I feel so grateful when I turn the unknown into\
  \ knowledge. There are many different ways to discover the unknown, read a book,\
  \ watch a movie, make a friend or travel, all of them will improve your life and\
  \ give freedom to your soul."
