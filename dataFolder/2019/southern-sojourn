Text: "We travel not to escape life but life not to escape us. This journey of ten\
  \ days started with our travel to Coorg - lush green surroundings, moving clouds,\
  \ and breezy weather on your drive to Kushalnagar serenades you to purity. It jolts\
  \ you back to simplicity. Our exploration started at Kushalnagar with Cauvery Nisargdhama,\
  \ the early morning next day. The slight drizzle and the excitement to reach the\
  \ island made us land there early in the morning.\n\nHowever, we never had complaints\
  \ as the first sip of Coorg coffee in the morning started our day. The river Cauvery\
  \ banks make an ideal stop for a picnic. The journey to Windflower Resorts Coorg\
  \ was ethereal and so was the stay. The emerald green hills and intoxicating whiff\
  \ of the coffee and pepper plantations make you belong. The next day, we were all\
  \ excited to visit Dubare Elephant Camp - we thought of exploring the camp for rafting\
  \ and our interaction with the elephants and get involved with the feeding and bathing.\
  \ When we reached there we realized it was hustling and bustling. the place was\
  \ well kept and there were rules and timing however, as we all know it few of us\
  \ believe the rules. However, we took it in the stride and while making sure we\
  \ caused less of discomfort to them participated in the activities. \n\nThe drive\
  \ to Mallalli Falls was the one we wished never ended - if heaven is anywhere it\
  \ was there. The designation was such that we never counted the steps to reach the\
  \ falls. It was raining and the mountains were covered with mist. As we were going\
  \ back to town we decided to make a quick pit stop at Abbi falls and then we went\
  \ to Raja Seat to soak it all in. The next day, we travelled to Mysore, a city with\
  \ its own unique flavor of architecture and food. I have seen lot of museums but\
  \ the sand sculpture museum was the one I really wanted to explore as it has 150\
  \ sculptures of sand in 16 different themes, which have been placed over an area\
  \ of 13500 sq. feet. \n\nThe next morning made us travel to local Ranganathittu\
  \ bird sanctuary at Srirangapatna. Early morning drizzle and birds chirping with\
  \ greenery and lake. A world to experience in its own, monsoon gave way to nesting\
  \ to thousands of birds. It is a place with story untold. Our journey was on a roll,\
  \ places undecided, early morning on our sit-out was a bird watching spree. We decided\
  \ we would go to mysore zoo. Mysore zoo has been maintained really well and is at\
  \ par with international standards spacious and clean enclosures, hospital and veterinary\
  \ services. After our short visit at the zoo because of time crunch we made a quick\
  \ pit stop at Chamundeshwari Temple to admire the architecture. The journey from\
  \ Mysore to Masinagudi was a wild ride. It falls within Mudumalai National Park\
  \ region under Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, an International Biosphere Reserve in\
  \ the Western Ghats and Nilgiri Hills ranges. We were welcomed with wildlife during\
  \ our bus as well as jeep ride. At Rolling Stones we experienced the wilderness\
  \ and hospitality unparalleled. \n\nThe property is without any boundary - acts\
  \ as an open corridor for animals to come and visit all day and night. The best\
  \ part was we were the only guests during our stay so we were able to bond with\
  \ every member including the owner of the place and his staff. Ideally, wild life\
  \ lovers go on safaris to see the wild life... in our case, the wild life walked\
  \ up to the property for a little t\xEAte-\xE0-t\xEAte. In addition, the home-cooked\
  \ food was finger-licking delicious. Mubeen the owner at Rolling Stones took us\
  \ for a drive to Marvakandy dam. Such a beautiful place and sunset at the dam with\
  \ the everchanging sky made it look ethereal. Last day at Masinagudi was again memorable\
  \ as we went for a short trail to a water hole. \n\nSometimes pictures aren't enough\
  \ to describe beauty of a place. Final adieu to Masinagudi is with the promise to\
  \ come again to experience home away from home."
