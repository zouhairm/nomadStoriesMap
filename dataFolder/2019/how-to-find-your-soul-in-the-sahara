Text: How to find a soul in the Sahara is the story of a nomadic girl, that was looking
  for something she lost; the story is based on a real story, is not about the goal
  is about the way you make, sandstorm, thirst, hungry and to lose a friend were the
  principal adventures and obstacles she had. Face adversity she said, alone in the
  mittle of nothing with the sun on her body at every step he took, she felt the sand
  in the whole body like a caress, after 73 hours walking her knees buckled, she was
  not able to make one more step, slowly her eyes close and the air of the night was
  just with her, she dreamed that she find a treasure and she was really happy about
  that she scream "Please, Please!! And suddenly, she woke up, in the mittle of the
  night, she was afraid;and her heart beat so much that anyone a kilometer could hear,
  she closed again her eyes and listened that somene was coming... at the end of the
  story, she fought and won the battle, and not just the battle outside, the battle
  she had inside with fears, and demonds, it is not what you find materially, but
  what you find inside you
