Text: "I had a breakdown. I visualized dots being connected between global cities\
  \ and blindly booked a one way ticket to Sydney. I had 30 days to go around the\
  \ world, on a desperate search for something unknown. \n\n\u201CAUSTRALIA!\u201D\
  \ (Oprah\u2019s voice) was all I could hear when I hit \u201Cpurchase\u201D on Delta.com.\
  \ It was a moment of joy, followed by sheer panic as I thought about being on a\
  \ plane for fifteen hours.\n\nI managed to cram one month\u2019s wardrobe, of opposite\
  \ seasons, into my largest suitcase. I was ready to arrive in the land of Hemsworth\
  \ brothers and koalas! The moment I landed, I was met with the unexpected. The \u201C\
  happy, sunny, life-changing Australia\u201D I imagined quickly turned into one of\
  \ the loneliest places, coupled with intense and incredibly jarring self-reflection.\
  \ I spent six long, emotional days in Sydney. I didn\u2019t know if it was the intense\
  \ jet lag, but I started releasing emotional debris from the past three years of\
  \ my life. I was running from myself. \n\nI took a breath. Maybe life does begin\
  \ at the point just beyond your comfort zone.\n\nI flew to Christchurch and took\
  \ a Lord of the Rings tour. I finally had to admit that I had never seen the movies\
  \ and was just there for the scenic views. There was a silent pause, then an uproar\
  \ of laughter. We stopped in the most incredible landscapes and playfully found\
  \ ourselves lost in action photos for hours. A beautiful lesson unfolded. I put\
  \ myself on a bus with complete strangers, a ridiculous trip to \u201CMiddle Earth\u201D\
  , but I then led the group up a mountain, swords (yes swords) in hand. I thought:\
  \ you never know where life will lead you, so always be open or you could miss something\
  \ magical.\n\nMelbourne felt like the best of New York and Seattle. Pulsing with\
  \ beauty, culture, nightlife and curated coffee shops. Dukes Coffee Roasters was\
  \ a coffee shop straight out of Kinfolk with the best flat whites and fresh almond\
  \ croissants. Still, I spent each morning staring at my reflection in the glass\
  \ ceiling of a lap pool. What was this journey I was on? \n\nI landed in Tokyo,\
  \ exhausted and illiterate. It was a miracle that I found anything, especially a\
  \ 7-eleven under a giant Godzilla. I walked everywhere, completely mesmerized by\
  \ the effortless blend of tradition vs. futurism. The streets were shockingly peaceful\
  \ despite a population of over 13 million people. Much of my time was spent fully\
  \ lost in translation. I went into a local store for water and a cup of ice and\
  \ walked out with water, ice cream and an iced coffee after sharing awkward gestures\
  \ with the store clerk. This was why I quickly loved Japan. You felt like a newborn\
  \ because nothing made sense and then everything made sense. You were fully present.\
  \ \n\nDubai was a welcome oasis, straight from The Alchemist. I arrived at 5am and\
  \ watched the sunrise on the beach. I made it. \nI decided to push my comfort zone\
  \ with a \u201Cdune bashing\u201D excursion. Our teenage guide watched YouTube while\
  \ driving with his knees. After a terrifying roller coaster, we made our way to\
  \ an Arabian Nights camp. Happy to be alive, I made a beeline for a trio of camels\
  \ amongst angry locals, starving cats and pangs of dark anxiety. I prayed and vowed\
  \ never to leave the resort again. \n\nThe final stop was St.Tropez. Basically,\
  \ heaven on Earth with the beautiful water, endless ros\xE9, and chic clubs like\
  \ Le Club 55 and Bagatelle. I felt renewed under the warm sun.\n\nIn total, I had\
  \ been in 7 countries; flown on 10 flights, lived in 8 time zones and crossed the\
  \ world in 30 days. \nWhen you travel around the world, your sense of time changes.\
  \ You realize how quickly each day passes, the possibilities of what we can do (or\
  \ waste) in each and how capable we are in our own adventure. My new perspective\
  \ was both enlightening and painful. Tears filled my eyes as I deeply felt what\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to find, myself. \n\n\u201CSo, I love you because the entire\
  \ universe conspired to help me find you.\u201D - Paulo Coelho"
