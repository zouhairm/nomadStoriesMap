Text: "Hi, \n\nI'm Mus, this is my travel story for this beautiful city of joy. I\
  \ came to Kolkata through ship as I working as a navigator on a container vessel.\
  \ \n\nFirst when I reached Kolkata as my ship sail from Singapore through the bay\
  \ of Bengal and enter the Hooghly River, my thoughts was different, what I see is\
  \ only small little buildings, and the river water was totally brown filled with\
  \ alot of rubbish but mind was still filling with a lot of negativity. But at the\
  \ same time, I put the negavity away and wanted to learn more about it. To be honest,\
  \ Kolkata is the most peaceful and beautiful place I ever been to. Here's my story\
  \ about Kolkata. \n\nHooghly River is an approximately 260 kms long distributary\
  \ of the Ganges River. It splits from the Ganges as a canal in Murshidabad District\
  \ at the Farakka Barrage. The river was an important transportation channel in the\
  \ early history of Bengal, and later with the colonial trading ports. The river's\
  \ presence is one of the reasons chosen by the British to settle there at Calcutta.\
  \ The Dutch / French colony at Chandannagar on the Hooghly was once the rival of\
  \ British Calcutta. The river banks hosted several battles and skirmishes towards\
  \ the start of the colonial era, including the Battle of Plassey Palashi, as well\
  \ as earlier wars against Maratha raiders. \n\nThe Hooghly river system is an essential\
  \ lifeline for the people of West Bengal. It is through this river that the East\
  \ India Company sailed in to Bengal and established their trade settlement - Calcutta,\
  \ which later grew up to be one of the greatest cities of the world and capital\
  \ of the erstwhile British India. People from other countries like French, Dutch,\
  \ Portuguese, etc. all had their trade settlement by the banks of this river. \n\
  \nDakshineshwar Temple, Kolkata, West Bengal, India Hooghly River is considered\
  \ very auspicious as it has links with River Ganges. On the banks of Hooghly, devotees\
  \ offer prayers and also perform last rites for the departed souls to rest in peace.\
  \ From the location that I was standing, on my left I could see the mighty Vidyasagar\
  \ Setu (Bridge) and to my right was the famous Howrah Bridge. Heavy fog had diminished\
  \ the visibility to a great extent. \n\nFormerly known as Calcutta, Kolkata is also\
  \ called The City of Joy. To be honest, I wonder why? Over 15 million people live\
  \ in this metropolis and its suburbs, making it one of the most congested metros\
  \ of the world. Most of the population just crams in the city and its public transportation\
  \ system. While new development happening on the outskirts is world-class, the life\
  \ in the city leaves much to be desired. \n\nHowrah Bridge, Kolkata, West Bengal,\
  \ India Kolkata served as the capital of India during the British Raj until 1911,\
  \ when its perceived geographical disadvantages and a growing nationalism in Bengal\
  \ led to the shift of the capital to New Delhi. The city is noted for its vibrant\
  \ political culture. It was a center of the Indian struggle for independence and\
  \ remains a hotbed of contemporary politics. Once the center of modern education,\
  \ science, culture, and politics in India, Kolkata witnessed economic stagnation\
  \ in the years following India's independence in 1947. However, since the year 2000,\
  \ economic rejuvenation has led to acceleration in the city's growth. Like other\
  \ metropolitan cities in developing countries, Kolkata continues to deal with contemporary\
  \ urban problems such as pollution and traffic congestion. \n\nI hope this sastify\
  \ the judges as I'm not a good writer but I'm willing to put more effort to learn,\
  \ I still have more to write but the box only requires 700 words, winning or losing\
  \ doesn't excite me, what excite me is to learn even more out there, meet more new\
  \ people, learn more about other people's culture from different countries regardless\
  \ of race and religion. \n\nBest regards \nMustaza Ismail"
