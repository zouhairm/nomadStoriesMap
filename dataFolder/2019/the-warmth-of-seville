Text: "Tired of the cold winds in London, I decided to travel to Seville in Spain\
  \ for some warmth with my three other friends. After going around all the tourist\
  \ attractions listed under \"places to visit in Seville\" on Google and being amazed\
  \ by the fact that famous movies and shows such as Star Wars and game of thrones\
  \ were shot in the famous spots of the city, we thought to ourselves that maybe\
  \ this was all that the city had to offer. We decided to go to watch a flamenco\
  \ performance. Little did we know that we were about to experience the extremely\
  \ majestic and passionate side of the city. A mix of clapping, tapping and snapping,\
  \ the flamenco dance was an indication to us that the city was way more than what\
  \ we had looked through google in the context of movies and shows. It made us realise\
  \ that we had actually missed out on all the intricate details of the city. \n\n\
  We again went to see all the places that we had gone to see before, only this time\
  \ it was different. This time we were not trying to just cross out our list of things\
  \ to see but we were indulging in the whole experience that it had to offer. We\
  \ crossed the Gualdalquivir river and ended up in the gypsy quarter of the city.\
  \ Chatting with the locals over their traditional tapas made us feel like we were\
  \ one of them. After experiencing the magical sunset by the river, we started wandering\
  \ in the streets of Seville. We came across local crowd dancing flamenco in one\
  \ of the Plazas and decided to give it a try. Even though our dancing skills were\
  \ terrible, it gave us an insight to the gleeful and euphoric ways of the city.\
  \ It made us feel like we belonged there. It was amazing how a foreign city made\
  \ us feel so much at home. \n\nHaving been brought up in a country like India, I\
  \ am always amused by the culture of other countries. While travelling, I always\
  \ try to engross myself with the particular country's lifestyle and food. Spain\
  \ made me feel like I didn't have to try to be part of them but that I was already\
  \ one of them. We actually found what we were looking for - some warmth."
