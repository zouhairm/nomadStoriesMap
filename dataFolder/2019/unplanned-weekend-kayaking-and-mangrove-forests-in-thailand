Text: "Two free days at the end of a business trip to Bangkok. The days leading up\
  \ to the business trip had been so busy that I\u2019d barely had a chance to learn\
  \ anything about the country and continent I was visiting for the first time. I\
  \ had no idea where to go or what to do. I just knew that I wanted to get out of\
  \ the heat and humidity of the crowded city. \n\nI asked my Thai colleagues where\
  \ I could escape to for the weekend. Each had an idea: Phuket said one, known for\
  \ its night life. How about Ko Samui said another, with its beaches and exquisite\
  \ temples? The most attractive suggestions was the Phi Phi Islands, if I really\
  \ wanted to get away from the city. \n\nGoogle told me that the Phi Phi islands\
  \ were in Krabi province, just a two-hour flight away. Minutes later, I had a flight\
  \ to Krabi and a booking at a local resort. Early the next morning, I was on an\
  \ unknown adventure.\n\nThe first thing I noticed as I stepped off the plane in\
  \ Krabi was that the air, although still hot and humid, was significantly more breathable\
  \ than in Bangkok. The taxi took me along wide open spaces consisting of smallholdings\
  \ and large-leafed tropical vegetation with the ocean far on the horizon. I soon\
  \ felt the claustrophobia of the city lifting off me.\n\nMy hotel in Ao Nang beach\
  \ town faced the beach. In no time, I had changed into comfortable shorts and tank\
  \ top, and took off for a long walk along the beach. The traditional fishing boats\
  \ were lazily coming back to shore, many of them decorated with flags and strips\
  \ of decorated cloth. On the street side, stalls sold fresh fruit, ice cream and\
  \ fried seafood delicacies. \n\nBut what really caught my attention were the magnificent\
  \ limestone rocks along the coast and jutting out of the ocean. \n\nBack at the\
  \ resort, I inquired about boat tours to the rocky outcrops. I was in luck. The\
  \ next morning, a guide would be departing for a full day sea kayaking tour from\
  \ Ao Nang to Ao Thalane and Hong Island. \n\nHaving kayaked only once before in\
  \ in still water, I wondered how on earth would I be able to row on the open ocean?\
  \ But since I\u2019m always game for a new adventure, I agreed, albeit with a bit\
  \ of trepidation!\n\nIt turned out to be an incredible day. I also was the only\
  \ customer, but the guide, Chati, still agreed to take me out.  I even got my own\
  \ kayak. The ocean kayaking was hard and only Chati\u2019s encouragement helped\
  \ me make my way through waves and wind. \n\nBut then we entered a mangrove forest.\
  \ The water became still as glass. The enormous trees drowned out the sounds and\
  \ the stink of diesel of the working harbour in the distance. The only sounds were\
  \ the birds singing in the trees and the rhythmic slapping of the oars on the water.\n\
  \nChati, with his limited English, noted my need for silence, but was also informative\
  \ as he guided our way through the mangrove forest, into caves, inlets and the other\
  \ hidden nooks. He pointed out birds, a snake, and landmarks, including the film\
  \ set for The Beach with Leonardo di Caprio. We lost ourselves for hours in the\
  \ mangrove forest, navigating the roots of the massive trees and stopping occasionally\
  \ for a snack. \n\nEmerging from the mangrove forest at the end of the day, the\
  \ wind had picked up and the rowing back to shore was nothing short of terrifying.\
  \ I rowed as if my life depended on it and Chati kept coming back for me, but we\
  \ eventually made our way back to the harbour and the hotel, to a welcome shower\
  \ and good night\u2019s sleep!\n\nI awoke the next morning with aching muscles and\
  \ prepared to begin the long trek back to South Africa. I could have stayed in Bangkok\
  \ and visited the famous temples, palaces and waterways. Instead, I plunged into\
  \ the unknown and visited a place of incredible beauty and a desire to return someday\
  \ and explore it further."
