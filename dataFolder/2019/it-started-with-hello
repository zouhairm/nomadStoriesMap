Text: "It had been a long and emotional 24 hours. At the bus stop in Edinburgh I had\
  \ just separated with my partner and was boarding a bus to Berlin to start over\
  \ again. I hopped on that bus knowing my life will never be the same. A day later\
  \ I arrived in Berlin as a single solo female traveller starting life over. \n\n\
  Life at that time was scary. I was in a place I didn\u2019t know the language, had\
  \ to find a place to live, had to find work to keep myself alive and for the first\
  \ time in a long time I was alone. I had to learn how to survive in this foreign\
  \ place all on my own. Part of me wanted to give up and go back home to Australia\
  \ where things were easy and comfortable. Despite the challenges, the spark that\
  \ made me want to explore Europe was still inside and burning brightly. This was\
  \ not an opportunity I could waste. I was determined to make this work. \n\nAt the\
  \ time I was living in a hostel in Berlin pushing myself every day to get out of\
  \ bed to make the most out of the day. I was discovering the intriguing city of\
  \ Berlin on my own.  One foot in front of the other, keeping myself moving with\
  \ a positive mental attitude. I kept telling myself about the opportunities the\
  \ city could offer. Berlin after all is a city of start-ups and is one of the trendiest\
  \ places in Europe. \n\nAfter a day of exploring and contemplating, sitting in the\
  \ hostel common room doing research I noticed a guy sitting near me on the lounge.\
  \ I was feeling lonely and he looked friendly so I took a chance and said hello.\
  \ Little did I know at the time that this person would have the biggest impact on\
  \ the rest of my time in Berlin and the rest of my travels. He was a nice young\
  \ German guy who had done a bit of travelling himself including visiting Australia.\
  \ We bonded over our love for travel and Australia and I laughed at how he pronounced\
  \ Darwin like Darvin in his thick German accent. We connected so well that he was\
  \ kind enough to offer his help in updating my CV to German and help me apply for\
  \ potential jobs. \n\nThe next day we spent the day together exploring the secrets\
  \ Berlin has hidden away from the general public. I remember walking with him in\
  \ a forest and exploring an old abandoned building from the war. It was a place\
  \ only locals would know about, rich in history and surrounded by a feeling of mystery\
  \ and eeriness. \n\nThat evening he went to a friend\u2019s house party and I went\
  \ back to the hostel for an early night watching movies in bed on my laptop. Relaxed\
  \ and cosy in bed I was unexpectedly surprised by my new best friend pulling me\
  \ out of bed and dragging me out to his friend\u2019s party. He had been to the\
  \ party and purposely came back get me. I was so overwhelmed by the sincere gesture\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t say no. At this party I met the girls renting the property,\
  \ after they heard about my situation they were kind enough to offer me a place\
  \ to stay which eventually turned into the place I lived in Berlin for a year. \n\
  \nBerlin will always hold a special place in my heart. I connected to Berlin on\
  \ multiple levels. It is the place I found my identity as an individual, solo female\
  \ traveller who could do anything. That connection started with a hello in a hostel\
  \ common room talking to a complete stranger. Just one act of kindness and my circumstances\
  \ changed for the better. We still keep in contact and I\u2019ve asked him about\
  \ that night. For him it was just one human being helping out another."
