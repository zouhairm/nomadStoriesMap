Text: "Hermanos, indeed\n\n\n     The trip I thought was going to be the adventure\
  \ of my life had finished. It was the first time I left South America to experience\
  \ life abroad. Eleven months passed by and the voyage around Australia and Southeast\
  \ Asia was over. I returned to Argentina for a number of reasons, including the\
  \ expiration of my Australian Working Holiday Visa and loving promises made for,\
  \ by then, my Argentine girlfriend. While traveling transforms, and the curiosity\
  \ behind getting to know another culture was deeply rooted in my mind and heart,\
  \ after depleting my savings for almost a year, I had to find a secure job to survive.\n\
  \n     Brazil, our huge neighbour, was the destination that welcomed me in mid-2014,\
  \ after going through a tough selective process for a management consulting firm.\
  \ Making some links between dates and facts, it is not difficult to size the situation:\
  \ a 26-year-old stereotypical Argentinian, passionate about soccer, lover of the\
  \ Argentine sky-colored flag, moving into the domain of his historical soccer archrival,\
  \ a sport of which its inhabitants are tremendously fanatical, amidst the heat of\
  \ a World Cup.\n\n     So, in June 2014, I made my way to the airport just as Lionel\
  \ Messi scored an amazing winning goal against Iran, and I arrived to Belo Horizonte,\
  \ the city where that match had taken place 5 hours prior. I had no doubt that because\
  \ of the event, the Brazilian streets would be a real party, with samba and beer\
  \ taking over every corner. Every face would be tinged with hope and joy that for\
  \ at least a month, the disadvantaged Brazilian population would forget about their\
  \ social and economic problems, something that happens back home when a match takes\
  \ place. It was a complete surprise to me that the local fans were receiving their\
  \ Argentine counterparts so peacefully and warmly when the matches between the two\
  \ countries are filled with pure hostility.\n\n     The tournament was finishing,\
  \ and one day after the catastrophic elimination of Brazil at the hand of the powerful\
  \ Germanic team, Argentina was going to play its first World Cup semi-final match\
  \ since 1990, against the Netherlands. The fantasised final between the two South\
  \ American giants was no longer going to happen, but my dream of seeing the colors\
  \ of my flag in the final remained. And Argentina did it.\n\n     My subconsciousness,\
  \ and the great festive atmosphere that took the tropical country led me to commemorate\
  \ the Argentine victory in the main square of the city. Overwhelmed with elation\
  \ and happiness, together with my Argentine colleagues I celebrated with our typical\
  \ war-cry songs, which by that point had become undeniable hits of the World Cup,\
  \ laced with obvious references against Brazil. Suddenly, we had dozens of Brazilian\
  \ (as well as foreign) eyes staring at us but, to our surprise, they were mostly\
  \ accompanied by gestures of joy and recognition. To be honest, I felt a slight\
  \ sense of fear alongside the euphoria that flooded me, particularly when a shirtless\
  \ and brawny man started walking directly towards me. When he arrived at my location,\
  \ he approached me and wrapped his toned arm around my neck, but without any violence.\
  \ Gently and in a friendly tone, he told me:\n\n                               \
  \                  \u201CFica tranquilo, irm\xE3o. Voc\xEAs fa\xE7am a sua festa\
  \ que n\xF3s j\xE1 fizemos a nossa. Parab\xE9ns, hermano\".\n\n                \
  \                                 \u201CIt is alright, brother. You can celebrate\
  \ your victory as we have before. Congratulations, hermano\u201D.\n\n     What happened\
  \ a week later, I could never have imagined in my wildest dreams. The Rio de Janeiro\
  \ streets were dyed light-blue and white, the people of Copacabana were listening\
  \ to cuarteto and Argentine cumbia rather than bossa nova, and cans of beer and\
  \ caipirinha glasses were replaced by cut-plastic-bottles of Fernet con Coca. I\
  \ never believed that I could be happy, even though Argentina has lost the final\
  \ match which could have been a great feat. But most of all, what I had never anticipated\
  \ was that I had fallen in love with Brazil and its people, my archrivals in the\
  \ sport I love the most."
