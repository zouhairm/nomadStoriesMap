Text: "I'm Writer, Director & Producer of my long documentary film.\n\nAswan, Jewish\
  \ temple, Heaven the dog and other things!\n(Working title)\n\nThe film tells the\
  \ true story of a girl who works as a journalist. Originally from Aswan in Upper\
  \ Egypt, she does not like this place praised by many others. \nShe has personal\
  \ reasons for this: her father divorced her mother, so the mother left Aswan with\
  \ her daughter to live in Cairo. Also, our protagonist was subdued to tribal customs\
  \ in Aswan before moving to Cairo including genital mutilation.\nThe girl tells\
  \ all this in a letter that has been sent to an unknown person in the beginning.\
  \ Over the course of the film though, we find out about the person's identity. \n\
  It is a journey from Aswan to Cairo, but also a personal journey to become a journalist\
  \ - along which she encounters many issues such as conservatism and cultural intolerance.\
  \ \nIn this respect, she also dialogues with Magda Haroun, the head of the Jewish\
  \ community in Egypt. In a rare if not unique moment, we film inside the Jewish\
  \ temple and its library in Cairo. High security measures surround the temple, shooting\
  \ is usually forbidden, as Egypt and Israel keep on fighting over the temple. \n\
  Our protagonist also witnesses the deterioration of other Egyptian cities such as\
  \ Aswan, Port Said, or Cairo along her way. \nIt's a journey of an Egyptian girl\
  \ who has a lot of pain and suffering inside herself and inside her country Egypt,\
  \ but she still has hope. Hope for change.\nShe thinks to travel abroad Egypt (\
  \ Europe ), in the same time she wants to stay here in Egypt.\n\n**\n\n8 Minutes\
