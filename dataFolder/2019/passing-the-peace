Text: "The Medina was damp and disgusting. Rain had drenched Fez all morning, leaving\
  \ the pathways of its famous marketplace swimming in pools of mud and other questionable\
  \ materials. The smell was a nauseating blend of barn animal, rainwater, heavy spices\
  \ and sweet pastries. \n\nTo my left hung a decapitated camel head.\n\nKeeping my\
  \ head down to avoid sight of the butchers\u2019 torture chambers interspersed between\
  \ stalls selling everything from argan oil to and spices, I weaved through the narrow\
  \ streets of this market of horrors. Inside the shops, however, was a completely\
  \ different story. I was met by jovial Moroccans in every store, welcoming and eager\
  \ to show off their goods. The carpet store owner was such a convincing salesman\
  \ that he almost had a group of college students sold on hand-woven rugs equivalent\
  \ to a semester\u2019s tuition. The artisans\u2019 passion as they presented the\
  \ goods to which they have devoted their entire lives was palpable. My dreary morning\
  \ mood was lifting, even though the rainclouds were not.\n\nWho knew shopping could\
  \ ever be a cultural experience? But in the Medina, this was a way to understand\
  \ ancient traditions, to connect over goods that carried months or years of labor,\
  \ heart and soul. And though we certainly looked out of place\u2014a group of white\
  \ American tourists with our backpacks and cameras slung over rain-drenched North\
  \ Face jackets\u2014somehow in the shops, the differences between us felt smaller,\
  \ the distance just a little less great.\n\n\u201CWhy is it you want to come to\
  \ my country ?\u201D a worker in the leather store asked me as I longingly fingered\
  \ a soft suede jacket. He had one glass eye, and in the other there was distinct\
  \ pride and curiosity.\n\nI weighed my response. The truth\u2014that I was an American\
  \ college student studying abroad in Spain and had the chance to cross Africa off\
  \ my bucket list\u2014 felt trivial in light of everything I had seen so far. \n\
  \n\u201CI wanted to experience another culture that was different from my own. And\
  \ I\u2019ve heard a lot about Morocco, but I wanted to see it for myself.\u201D\
  \ I finally said.\n\n\u201CWell, what you hear is not all true,\u201D he told me,\
  \ almost apologetically. My mind flashed to the often harsh Muslim portrayals and\
  \ what he must think I think of him. \u201CHere we welcome you. We are happy you\
  \ are here. We wish you peace\u2026 We want peace.\u201D\n\nHis statement was raw,\
  \ and it broke my heart. For a moment he wasn\u2019t a shopkeeper trying to sell\
  \ me a leather jacket; we were just two people from worlds apart forging an unlikely\
  \ connection.\n\nI didn't buy the jacket, but an exchange still took place. As I\
  \ exited the shop, he offered his blessing: \"As-salaamu \u2018alaikum.\u201D\n\
  I first tried to reciprocate the response, before becoming tongue-tied over the\
  \ pronunciation and ending with the only word that popped into my brain: \u201C\
  Shalom.\u201D He laughed amiably, eye twinkling, and kindly informed me that was\
  \ the wrong religion.\n\nThat's OK. The smile I caught over my shoulder as I left\
  \ told me we understood each other all the same."
