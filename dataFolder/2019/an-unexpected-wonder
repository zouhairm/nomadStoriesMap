Text: "I ran wildly down the path towards the river, gravel crunching under my feet,\
  \ I was all alone except the big ship looming at the end of that road.\nThere are\
  \ many quick getaways near Kolkata and most of them are usually tourist infested\
  \ by the weekends. While searching for places to go during New Year\u2019s eve,\
  \ my father suggested Haldia. It is a small industrial town located near Kolkata\
  \ and settled on the banks of Haldi and Hooghly river. The town is famous and an\
  \ important petrochemical hub, naturally, the town is interspersed with townships\
  \ . It has a major riverfront. I was much skeptical about it as it is far from being\
  \ considered as a tourist spot. Nonetheless, we booked our rooms at Haldia Bhawan.\
  \ Being a government accommodation, it was cheap but bookings can only be done through\
  \ online or approaching their Kolkata office.\nOn a bright sunny morning, we left\
  \ for Haldia in our car. It was a journey of 118.5 km . The entry to the town is\
  \ marked by a huge gate, also known as Haldia Gate. Upon approaching the town, I\
  \ could see humongous chimneys and big factories. For some reason, the grandeur\
  \ of it all and the straight winding roads through the town made me feel at peace.\
  \ Even before exploring the town properly, I had a liking for it. \nHaldia Bhawan\
  \ is situated near the Haldi river. The glittering river in the morning is a sight\
  \ of amazement from the room\u2019s balcony. It shines brighter than the brightest\
  \ jewels. A road from the gate of the building leads straight to the bank of the\
  \ river. There is a narrow lane along the river bank, dotted with seating arrangements\
  \ and flanked with palm trees. We enjoyed quite a lot of our afternoons and evenings\
  \ , strolling along the road or just sitting and admiring the river. Another matter\
  \ of wow factor for me was to watch the big ships slowly sail by the river so close\
  \ to me. There were so many different kind of ships and some were unloading at the\
  \ nearby docks and some are just on their way. The scenario called for an excellent\
  \ sunset and indeed it was excellent. It was postcard perfect. The scenario of the\
  \ sun setting  and the silhouette of the ships on the almost golden river, is a\
  \ sight to behold for hours on end.  The place has got a lot more to offer than\
  \ just factories and ships. It has the charm of an old township with it slow-paced\
  \ life and close knitted bonds. There are even quite a few heritage locations and\
  \ temples. Oh, and how could I forget the local market and the frequent fairs. They\
  \ are small and genuine. We headed out to one such fair and had a lot of freshly\
  \ made sweets. The best I had in a long time. Going to these places, you get a feel\
  \ of the local life. There is a road along the riverside, known as the Marine Drive.\
  \ It stretches from coast guard jetty to 3rd oil jetty point. The road is simply\
  \ picturesque. There are quite a few ghats along this road and you can even opt\
  \ for a small boat ride in the river  (prior booking is necessary). A small note\
  \ for all bird lovers ; the quieter parts of the town are a bird\u2019s haven and\
  \ we were lucky enough to get glimpses of a variety of birds. \nTo summarize my\
  \ trip, I would say that I was not bored for a second in Haldia, probably because\
  \ I get overly excited as a kid upon seeing big ships or fire emitting chimneys\
  \ or perhaps the variety of birds and the innumerable windy roads I found. This\
  \ small town got me all excited yet had a very homely feel about it.  There is a\
  \ quiet serenity about this place as it is not much commercialized. If you are looking\
  \ for a quick holiday and in the mood to not being ripped off by overly commercialized\
  \ places or looking forward to not seeing more tourists and more of your home city\
  \ people, this is the perfect place for you."
