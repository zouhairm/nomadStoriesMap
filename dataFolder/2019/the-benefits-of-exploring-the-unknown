Text: "There is no other way to enter the unknown than by doing it, once the decision\
  \ is made to begin and the mind is asking for it. In that sense, such action does\
  \ not necessarily require a concrete displacement of the person. That is, you can\
  \ enter the unknown by reading from home, for example, so that the intellectual\
  \ conditions necessary to advance in that project are created.\nAt the same time,\
  \ entering into the unknown should be, in general conditions, a product of curiosity,\
  \ otherwise it would be entering the grounds of the 'danger', a fact that would\
  \ subsequently lead to an unwanted scenario. \nIn other words, the entrance to the\
  \ unknown can sometimes be the result of fortuitous or accidental conditions, and,\
  \ in this case, entering the unknown for reasons beyond personal motivation could\
  \ be unpleasant.\nAnyway, the ideal would be that the experience with the unknown\
  \ is done under good conditions, because even if the goal is to transmit some knowledge\
  \ from research, then we would not transmit the correct colour of a message if the\
  \ conditions are not optimal. Then, the results will be positive or not, but the\
  \ experience must be done under consciousness.\nUnder this framework, given the\
  \ desired conditions, the unknown could enrich the person from varied perspectives.\
  \ In that aspect, we can mention the cultural perspective, the spiritual perspective,\
  \ the intellectual perspective, among others. The unknown is, in short, one of the\
  \ most efficient ways to renew the human spirit. The loss of the same leads to the\
  \ lack of mental exercise and, therefore, affects our mood in the long term, because\
  \ learning new things is equivalent to activating the loitering again. In short,\
  \ it is about questioning our structure of reality and updating ourselves every\
  \ so often.\nImmediately, there is the sensation of venturing and of equating, for\
  \ example, generations. In many cases it is rare to see older people in language\
  \ schools, but this situation allows informal interaction between the elderly person\
  \ and the young person or adult. Therefore, the limits of age are indirectly challenged.\n\
  Followed, with the unknown also appears the development of creativity, because in\
  \ many occasions the previous research is not enough to cover all the scenarios\
  \ that occur when a cultural exchange is made in another country, for example. That\
  \ is, the exposure of the person to certain scenarios never seen before works as\
  \ a catapult to re-activate the sense of resolution. \nLikewise, the comfort zone,\
  \ as a friend of the routine, is also affected by the idea of the unknown. At the\
  \ same time, previous opinion from a specialist, certain symptoms of dissatisfaction\
  \ can be avoided. \nIn other words, you can never know everything in life and when\
  \ a frame is generated, a sense of emptiness happens, which, from a personal point\
  \ of view, is nothing more than a lack of completeness in the modern world. Even\
  \ those who have been successful in life and in the family may need to reform their\
  \ repertoire of information. Putting the mind to play is never negative given the\
  \ desired conditions, because information is never destroyed but recycled. In that\
  \ sense, it is then a sanitization from a certain point.\nFinally, self-esteem also\
  \ plays a beneficial role in the practice of the unknown. Those people who dare\
  \ to move along the path of the unknown are also people who learn more quickly to\
  \ accept different types of realities; that is, different ways of doing the same,\
  \ being able to benefit from the openness and exchange of knowledge, in conditions\
  \ of mutual growth, either cultural or what so ever. After all, nobody has the absolute\
  \ truth and this idea can lead to a hindrance in personal growth. \nIn conclusion,\
  \ there are many positive aspects in the openness to the unknown, but above all\
  \ to understand that behind the negatives in this regard is the monster of boredom.\
  \ The diet of the mind works in the same way as the diet of the body. The tastes\
  \ of salsa vary like Italian sauces and whenever it is safe it is also fun to grab\
  \ a different path. Only a madman/woman would not see benefits in the fun, whatever\
  \ their origin."
