Text: "The modern world has not eliminated human slavery as much as people like to\
  \ think. Few are aware of the magnitude of slavery in France. Sexual exploitation\
  \ forms a large part of the modern slave trade, but there is also a great problem\
  \ with sweatshop workers, domestic slavery, and minors forced to work as thieves\
  \ and beggars. Anyone, including natives and tourists, can become victims. \u201C\
  Police estimated that ninety percent of the fifteen thousand to eight thousand female\
  \ prostitutes working in the country were trafficking victims, and that three thousand\
  \ to eight thousand children were forced into prostitution and labor.\u201D This\
  \ is my story.  \n\n\tCrisp ocean air blew the wispy tendrils of hair around her\
  \ face. After being cooped up with the same people for almost three weeks, she needed\
  \ some space from her traveling companions. She'd seen so much of France in the\
  \ short amount of time she'd been there, but she hadn't gotten a chance to do any\
  \ exploring on her own.  \n\tThe little harbor of St Rapha\xEBl was bustling with\
  \ fishermen and tourists. She dodged through the crowd until she arrived at the\
  \ dock. It was vacant except for two men and a little boy. One of the men approached\
  \ her and spoke something in French. His eyes were a startling shade of blue in\
  \ his weathered brown face and his smile had an unpleasant tone. She was struck\
  \ with a wave of uneasiness once he realized she didn't speak French and queried\
  \ again in English, \u201CAre you staying here? Where is your hotel?\u201D \n\t\
  Warning bells sounded in her head as she remembered her friends warning her about\
  \ sex traffickers in France. She pointed in the opposite direction of where her\
  \ hotel was and forced as natural of a smile as possible. The blue-eyed man continued\
  \ staring at her with the same unnerving smile while pulling out his phone as she\
  \ hurried away in the direction she had pointed in. Once she was out of his sight,\
  \ the girl doubled back down an alley, trying to reach her hotel without the blue\
  \ eyed man spotting her.  \n\tHer heart slammed in her chest as she ran down the\
  \ back roads, constantly checking over her shoulder. Just as she thought she had\
  \ lost him, she noticed a large white van cruising down the main road with the blue-eyed\
  \ man and his companion scanning the sidewalks. Her face paled, and she ducked behind\
  \ a building, praying they hadn't seen her. She froze with bated breath for a full\
  \ thirty seconds before peering out from behind the corner...and coming face to\
  \ face with the blue-eyed man! He chuckled and tried to grab her. A wave of anger\
  \ swept over her. \u201CDo NOT touch me!\u201D she shouted, kicking him hard in\
  \ the groin. The blue-eyed man cried out in pain and doubled over as she wrenched\
  \ herself away from him.  \n\tThe girl threw caution to the winds and bolted off\
  \ at top speed in the direction of her hotel. Her breathing was ragged and her legs\
  \ burned, but she didn't dare slow her pace or look back.  After what seemed like\
  \ an eternity, she reached the hotel. She went straight to her room, and sat alone\
  \ on her bed, shaking as the realization of her close call hit her.\n\nOne week\
  \ later\n\n\tThe girl scrolled absently through her Facebook feed. She'd been back\
  \ in the US for 3 days now. The remainder of her trip in France had been uneventful,\
  \ and she hadn't seen the blue-eyed man, or told anyone about her frighting encounter.\
  \ As she moved to turn her phone off, an article on Facebook caught her eye. She\
  \ clicked on it, and her blood turned to ice in her veins. At the top of the page\
  \ there was a picture of the blue-eyed man next to a photo of a young girl. The\
  \ headline read: American Teen Missing in France: Last Seen With This Man.\n\nPatt,\
