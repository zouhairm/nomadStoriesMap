Text: Landing in Portugal is to start a journey, with breathtaking views, for a country
  full of history and stories. It is walking along typically cobbled sidewalks and
  see richly decorated homes, many of them tiled, wherever you go from north to south
  in the country. It is to know that centuries of history have carved the life of
  this country and that with much pride their people embrace the future without abandoning
  the learning and traditions that run in their memory and in their blood. It is to
  stand in the midst of the day-to-day dynamics of local people to enjoy sights, moods
  and lifestyles, and to forget for seconds that time flies because it breathes good
  vibes and energy. It is to pass several times by the same place and to be able to
  always be astonished as if it were the first time; it is to discover details and
  news at every step and never to get tired of  walking there. It is to enter in the
  night inside with good food, wine, conversations and fado or another style of music
  according to the taste of each one or desire. It is to run on the beach, bathe in
  the cold Atlantic or blend of tepid waters with the Mediterranea;, is to walk in
  historic villages and tread the mountains and hills full of legends and  enchanted
  Moors. It is to live many experiences within one experience and never get tired
  of going out in here!
