Text: "We had reached the end of the city, and all we could see where dried fields\
  \ and the pristine coastline of Albania. The two, who had picked me up, had already\
  \ checked into their hotel; they had already reached their holiday, however they\
  \ were determined to take me to mine. And, after driving through the city, we still\
  \ hadn\u2019t found it. \n\tThe people who I was staying with told me to meet them\
  \ at \u2018Pizza Savos,\u2019 I however read this as Piazza. \n\tWe drove back towards\
  \ the city, stopping to ask one local who didn\u2019t know, and the next, who also\
  \ did not know, until we reached a large white hotel that looked out over the blue\
  \ waters that sparkled under summer sun to ask a group of policemen who seemed to\
  \ be standing around, twiddling their thumbs. \n\tI was left in the car with the\
  \ Kiwi husband and their one year old child who was fascinated by my ginger hair\
  \ and who enjoyed playing the game, \u2018let\u2019s throw all the toys on the floor\
  \ again, and again, and again,\u2019  whilst the mother, fortunately Albanian, went\
  \ to go ask. Within five minutes she was back, saying that they knew the place very\
  \ well, everyone knew the place very well (just not the ones we had asked), and\
  \ it was easy to get to. \n\tThe police car, (of sorts), stormed off, in the direction\
  \ of the city, siren deafening, and the blue and red flashes invisible in the mid-day.\
  \ We followed closely behind, flying passed one car and the next, driving on the\
  \ wrong side of the road, (feeling more at home in the left lane), heading into\
  \ oncoming traffic, blazing through the busy summer city. The police escort did\
  \ not slow around corners, it did not slow for anyone walking across the road, and\
  \ it did not stop at the odd traffic light. It informed everyone that they were\
  \ on a mission, and they had right of way. \n\tWe arrived at a steep hill, continuing\
  \ to speed through, and now up, the city, for the police to suddenly pullover, (in\
  \ the middle of the road), and for an arm to shoot out of the window and wave the\
  \ woman back over to the battered cop car. She jogged over and bent down. Her head\
  \ went back and forth from the shop, on her right, to the car, as if watching a\
  \ tennis match. And once everything was clear, she came back and the police were\
  \ off; a number of hands waving through the cloud of dust that they brought to life.\
  \ I got out, grabbed my bag and threw it onto the floor. \n\tWhen I started off,\
  \ making my way to Sarand\xEB from Vlor\xEB I made it half way, ending up being\
  \ stuck in the middle of a forgotten tourist destination, that only Germans seemed\
  \ to pass through, to then be dropped of at a wooden shack, (thought of as a shop),\
  \ by two drunken Albanian men, who tested their car\u2019s performance, engine and\
  \ brakes on the steep cliffs along the coast, to, after being lost in a small city,\
  \ have a police escort to a pizza restaurant to meet two people who were giving\
  \ me a bed to rest my head for a night or two. \n\tI thanked the married couple\
  \ with all of my heart, not being able to expression my appreciation with my words,\
  \ wishing them the holiday of their dreams before they drove off and left me on\
  \ a road that parted the city into two and opened it up to the sea that the sun\
  \ set across, painting the sky a deep pink above the twinkling lights of Corfu.\
  \ I turned to the pizza place, rang the guys, and felt a rumble in my stomach. When\
  \ in Rome, they say, however, in this case, when in Sarand\xEB."
