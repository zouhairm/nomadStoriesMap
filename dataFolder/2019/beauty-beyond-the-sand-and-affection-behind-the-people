Text: "If have a something that I love in the world is see how the simple things are\
  \ beautiful\n\nI was lot tired of my routine and stressed in July 2017 a lot , and\
  \ made a travel to Len\xE7ois Maranhenses in Maranh\xE3o located in the city of\
  \ Barreirinhas, Brazil\nI was not expecting to find so much peace in this place,\
  \ we arrived in Barreirinhas by the morning there and felt a connection instantly,\
  \ the city is charming and gorgeus, the connection that I felt made me forgot all\
  \ troubles that was on me, minutes after arrived we went to the \"Grandes Len\xE7\
  ois\" ando to get there we have pass one enormous adventure, we left the hotel and\
  \ we met the driver that took us to the \"Len\xE7ois\", He was funny, and my father\
  \ is a people who made relations quickly, after 10 minutes a person who didn't know\
  \ them, probably tought that they are childhood friends.\nI tought that the way\
  \ to arrive there was calm, but the way was full of adventure, I was with my mom,\
  \ my brother and a friend, the pickup truck pass through big holes full of mud,\
  \ pass through big weeds, we entered in a lot of woods, and we have so much fun,\
  \ my mom screamed a lot, but she was have such a great time.\nWe have to made a\
  \ crossing a river on a boat, the river was very deep, we were very afraid because\
  \ there were a lot people on the boat, and the boat wasn't totally safe\nWhen we\
  \ finished cross the river we kept the adventure in the pickup truck, we saw lot\
  \ of nature, the vegetation, the plants, everything was lovely, enthralling, we\
  \ arrived in a local that we saw just sand,like a desert, and the weather was hot,\
  \ we just walked and walked until can look how amazing the \"Len\xE7ois Maranhenses\"\
  \ are. \"Len\xE7ois\" means \"sheets\", the word refers to the large colored lakes,\
  \ some lakes are blue and some are green, and the water is so crystalline that you\
  \ can see the bottom of the lake neat.\nWe have so much fun and I can't felt anything\
  \ just gratitude, because that place was very fascinating and have this experience\
  \ with my parents and my brother is a thing that I can't forgot never. We were turning\
  \ back to the hotel, and It started rain a lot, when we took the boat to cross the\
  \ river back, was in everything in the dark, was late night and the people started\
  \ to be afraid, the rain began to fall heavier and stronger,  loud and sudden thunders\
  \ started to drop. It was so relieving when I turned the flashlight from my cellphone\
  \ on and see people  calming others and taking care of one another. Those simple\
  \ things makes me believe that the human being can be good in nature.\nAfter we\
  \ arrived in the hotel, we just take a little rest and we went explore the city\
  \ of Barreirinhas, the city is simple, but so cute, hanging out with those people\
  \ was amazing, every corner in the coastal square have a different kind of music\
  \ , but the hotter kind music was \"forro\", principally \"forro p\xE9 de serra\"\
  , this music have an addictive rhythm and the dance is full of movements, cadence,\
  \ joy, shake and interaction.\nPeople was very receptive and attentive, definitely\
  \ is a place that I can go back anytime that I have opportunity. In other day we\
  \ visited the \"Ilha do Cabur\xE9\", we took a boat again to get there, arriving\
  \ in the place we saw a lot of little monkeys and was amazing how they are smart,\
  \ one of the instantaneatly jumped in the shoulder of my father to take one biscuit\
  \ that him was eating, the monkey stay in my dad's shoulder for a while and I got\
  \ surprised how the monkey kept calm and liked to be in my dad's shoulder. We saw\
  \ a lot of men walking rinding camels in the dunes and we just and we just managed\
  \ to think like they were not feeling hot. In that travel I was so happy that I\
  \ remember it until today."
