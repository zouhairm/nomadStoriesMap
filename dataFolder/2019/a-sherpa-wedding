Text: "The night is dark, the moon covered by heavy clouds of rain. Artificial light\
  \ shines brightly on the guests as they burst, hands in the air, into an energetic,\
  \ rhythmic and explosive dance. Big wall-like speakers howl Nepali pop songs loudly\
  \ into the open air, causing it to travel far and expand into the valley, crashing\
  \ into the vast mountain-range that surrounds it. The plot of land chosen for the\
  \ celebration is structured in the form of a terrace with three levels. The lower\
  \ one is an open arena of dancing and drinking, where the main events happen for\
  \ the guests. This \"dance floor\" is encircled by woods of scarce vegetation -\
  \ at this altitude, it is not as lush as in the plains of the south - and features\
  \ a massive 30-person tent for the tired attendants to have a well-deserved rest\
  \ in. Everyone is dressed in traditional Nepali clothing, even the foreigners are\
  \ wearing the topi and sari, generously lent by the neighbours of the village.\n\
  Around the lamp-posts, circles of dancers are formed with members of every generation.\
  \ They start moving, shaking their hands to the rhythm of the song as if wanting\
  \ to summon something out of thin air, constantly advancing, creating a hypnotic\
  \ effect like an enacting of a mantra.\nOn April 2015, this village, with many others\
  \ ranging from Tibet to the Kathmandu valley along the Himalaya chain, was shaken\
  \ to its core by a massive earthquake. It was Saturday, and many people were out\
  \ working in the fields, but in this village, Dhumtang in the Sindhupalchowk region,\
  \ 1 out of every 3 lives were lost, and all the structure - school, houses, the\
  \ road connecting the nearest city with Tibet - were completely destroyed and left\
  \ in ruins. Since then, many organizations sent their teams and joined forces with\
  \ the local population. Most of the houses - even in a temporary, CGI and bamboo-based\
  \ form - are now standing, the road is about to be reopened, and a team of around\
  \ 20 volunteers, teaming up with local masons, is very close to finishing an earthquake-resistant\
  \ school for the children of all the valley. Even if there is still a long way to\
  \ go, there is plenty of cause for celebration.\nIt is a Nepali wedding after all,\
  \ and as such, food could never be less than over-abundant. One level above the\
  \ celebration, all the observers - either too old, too shy or just not in the mood\
  \ to dance - crouch, discuss and laugh about the mishaps of the roundabout of dancers\
  \ below them. Behind them are a couple of wide tables and big pots filled with Tomato\
  \ Dal Bhat and a very expensive treat, Buffalo Chili. They are both spicy delicacies,\
  \ full of colour, and calories for the long night ahead. Also, and maybe more importantly,\
  \ many liters of Raksi - a sort of moonshine, locally distilled inside people\xB4\
  s houses, with a similar taste to Japanese sake - are displayed along the tables\
  \ in jars for everyone to take. Anyone who is distracted for long enough, or not\
  \ fast in covering their glass with their hand, will be served another round until\
  \ all the stock is finished.\nOn the top level, right next to the entrance, the\
  \ family of the groom is greeting all of the arriving guests, overlooking the celebration\
  \ away from all the noise. The groom is wearing a theatrically golden round hat,\
  \ bordered by a patch of Yak wool, resembling the ones found in the steppes of Mongolia,\
  \ sitting proudly with a straight back surrounded by his family members. On arrival,\
  \ guests present their gifts and are received by them, obliged to stay still all\
  \ night.\nIt is an adventure in itself reaching these pastures. The valley is secluded\
  \ and far from the closest city, reachable only after a six-hour bumpy bus ride\
  \ from Kathmandu, and a one-hour trek up the mountain through wiggly floating bridges\
  \ and possible spectacular falls on scarped ridges. Even if not for the faint-hearted,\
  \ the secretiveness of it - don\xB4t expect crowds -, the wild exuberance of the\
  \ flavours, the culture, the dramatic landscapes are among the things that make\
  \ this region one of the best travel destinations in the whole world.\nLong live\
  \ the newlyweds!"
