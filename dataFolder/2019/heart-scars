Text: "Zimbabwean-born Isabel Daniels is leading a carefree, somewhat ineffectual\
  \ existence in London, partying hard and not overly inspired by much else. Presented\
  \ with the alternative of going to work in Thailand as a dive instructor, Izzy jumps\
  \ at the opportunity; with no obvious responsibilities or attachments to hold her\
  \ back, she\u2019d swap the damp and cold of England for the warm waters of Thailand\
  \ any day. \n    Her casual way of life is continued \u2013 if not improved \u2013\
  \ on the idyllic island of Koh Tao, where her most pressing obligations are to take\
  \ tourists scuba diving, and not to miss her weekly yoga class... Although she is\
  \ far from home and forms no significant bonds with anyone on the island, she meets\
  \ plenty of travellers to keep her entertained.\n    Completely out of the blue,\
  \ Izzy\u2019s friend Kyle \u2013 who she has a secret crush on \u2013 arrives at\
  \ the lodge where she works; he needs to do a scuba course and figures it\u2019\
  s a good excuse to visit Izzy in Thailand. Long-suppressed feelings, and the romantic\
  \ nature of the island, soon prevail and the young couple find themselves in the\
  \ throes of a passionate love affair.\n    This magical bubble suddenly bursts on\
  \ New Year\u2019s Eve, when a drunken Frenchman on a scooter causes an accident\
  \ that nearly kills Izzy.\n    Much like the impact suffered to her skull, Izzy\u2019\
  s outlook on life takes a hard knock \u2013 she begins to question her ultimate\
  \ destiny and feels a greater appreciation for the people who love and care for\
  \ her, as well as an overwhelming need to be closer to them. This convinces her\
  \ to leave Thailand and go with Kyle to Knysna, the small coastal town in South\
  \ Africa where her parents are now living.\n    Once in Knysna, Izzy \u2013 with\
  \ the support and guidance of those who love her \u2013 starts to piece herself\
  \ back together, and discovers meaningful inspiration for her new life."
