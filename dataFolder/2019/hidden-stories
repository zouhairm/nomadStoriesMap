Text: "\"Pray for me from Heaven, Mom. I miss you. Sorry for not being able to make\
  \ you happier when you are with me.\" \n\n\tThe paper in my hand felt heavier. It\
  \ was just a scrawl, large letters with uneven spacing, no sign of sophistication.\
  \ Probably a kid wrote this. I was standing inside a two by two meters wooden box\
  \ with elevated flooring, surrounded by envelopes put on stand. On each envelopes,\
  \ a letter. On each envelopes, a secret people hid. \n\tAfter a trip I had planned\
  \ for months failed on the last moment, I had two days to spend with bleak prospect.\
  \ I should have been island hopping on Belitung, exploring the lighthouse, swimming\
  \ in crystal blue water, and dining on fresh seafood. Probably ease my worries for\
  \ a while. Instead, I was stuck looking at greyish cloud of Jakarta sky, another\
  \ day to feel stuck in this unforgiving city. Nothing could turn out to be worse,\
  \ so I decided to visit an art museum in Jakarta. Its name was Museum of Modern\
  \ and Contemporary Art in Nusantara or what Jakartans amusingly called as Museum\
  \ Macan, with \u201Cmacan\u201D is an Indonesian word for tiger. \n\tNever I thought\
  \ that I would peek into others\u2019 intimate thought in the museum. \n\tIt was\
  \ an art installation, titled Letter Writing Project by Lee Ming Wei, encouraging\
  \ people to pour their most intimate, secretive thoughts into a letter. It could\
  \ be sent, if the writer wanted to, only an address needed. \n\tMy hand reached\
  \ for another letter. The letter\u2019s surface felt coarse, the wording on it gentle.\
  \ \n\n\t\"I love you. Come to me. \u2013R-\" \n \n\tI took another. \n\n\t\"For\
  \ the future me, do not give up. You could make it through. The difficulties now\
  \ will make you smile later on. \"\n\n\tMy hands kept reaching for another envelope.\
  \ A love letter, an apology, a thank you note, stories people kept hidden. Worries,\
  \ unhappiness, grief, the naked truth of human being. Raw emotion.  \n\tFor me travelling\
  \ has always been for peace and solitude. No crazy boss messaging. No demanding\
  \ friends asking to meet. Travel was supposed to be on an exotic destination, miles\
  \ flown away from home. Further, better, because I could be a stranger in a stranger\
  \ places, finally away.  It had always been a mission to appreciate human differences,\
  \ without forgetting the fact that how each of us is just a bundle of the same worries\
  \ and thoughts.\n\tIt was just supposed to be a visit, a compensatory trip. A mere\
  \ two miles away from home and I found solace. Solitude. Each letter chipped away\
  \ my weariness. No backpack, luggage, boarding pass needed. Peace engulfed me. I\
  \ was not alone in this rat race. \n\tI took a paper and the envelope provided.\
  \ I walked away, leaving a letter. Maybe another may find solace in my thoughts."
