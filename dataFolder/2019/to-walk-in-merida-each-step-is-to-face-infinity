Text: "One never ceases to write about Merida. Sedimented layers of times \u2013past,\
  \ present and future ones\u2013 resonate within the \u201Cciudad blanca\u201D of\
  \ the Yucat\xE1n Peninsula. Merida is the mythic origin of this world. 65 million\
  \ years ago, an incandescent, blazing fireball burst against the earth. The journey\
  \ started then.\nThe first time I heard about this place was probably as a child,\
  \ in some history or geography class. Another collision took place in Merida, millions\
  \ of years after the meteorite. In 1517 the Europeans arrived. Merida saw the first\
  \ cathedral built in Mexico.  My parents used to reminisce about their own trips\
  \ to Merida during their youth. As I heard about their wanderings through Mayan\
  \ pyramids, their sleepless nights under starry skies and the enigmas buried deep\
  \ under the waters of the cenotes, I began to imagine and dream of the place I would\
  \ visit many years after.\nI arrived to Merida on November 3rd, 2018. I flew from\
  \ Mexico City, where I had spent a couple of weeks after living for a while in Chicago.\
  \ Like Jack Kerouac, my life was on the road back then. To remain in one single\
  \ place was not an option. I was a meteorite drifting through the cosmos. The road,\
  \ this time, took me to Merida. The local university had summoned historians from\
  \ all over the country to present their research papers, and with them, my own.\
  \ The subject: history of the nomadic lifestyle. In my experience, a matter cannot\
  \ be truly analyzed unless one allows it to alter the conception of life itself\
  \ whilst doing so. To embody thought is to become a living account of its strength.\
  \ In this sense, my journeys and my writing bear witness of the relationship between\
  \ the depths of my being and the surfaces of the world that surround it. To write\
  \ and to travel is to constantly waver between these two spaces. The journey was\
  \ a fusion of the density of mythic origins, imagined and dreamed accounts, and\
  \ reality itself.\nAfter landing, I fetched my bags and hurled away from the crowd.\
  \ Through the hallways, an insistent series of publicity images advertised apartment\
  \ buildings with exclusive golf courses and breathtaking ocean views. Currently,\
  \ the city\u2019s extension is almost absolute. The existence of \u201Cnatural reserves\u201D\
  \ is a proof of this, because only the city itself can measure, calculate, design.\
  \ Are we close to the point where isolated, like Walden will no longer exist? I\
  \ was expelled to the outside. Airports are liminal zones of indetermination. They\
  \ operate as limbos of status and identity. They are platforms where cultural fusion\
  \ take place. Airplanes are womb-machines that embrace us while they slide in virtuality.\
  \ In a way, landing in Merida was being pushed out of a metallic womb. There I was,\
  \ born again.\nAs I exited the airport, I was confronted with another atmosphere.\
  \ Not only the weather but the culture as well let the idea of being in another\
  \ place sink in.  The heat was singular, it transformed my body into a pore. Through\
  \ it, I was intersected by everything and everyone, and vice versa. The jungle and\
  \ the coast transformed time, it melted, and again, like in olden times, days weren\u2019\
  t measured by minutes. It was the setting of the sun and the rising of the moon\
  \ that measured the length of days, the taxi driver told me as he drove me downtown.\
  \ He suggested me to get a refreshment at noon at \u201CEliados\u201D, a traditional\
  \ cantina where families, workers and students enjoyed live music whilst unlimited\
  \ beers and oysters were served. The 16th century churches on the street reminded\
  \ me of the legends of El Dorado that, surely, were told in that time. Some of the\
  \ main entrances had medieval sirens, shells and Hercules columns carved on the\
  \ stone. Songs from the Mediterranean world tell the story of Odysseus, the voyager\
  \ that had to leave his house in order to return to it. Odysseus, like every nomad,\
  \ is a frontiersman. The signs of the journey joined mine like signals that guided\
  \ roads of other times and spaces.\nTo walk in Merida, each step, is to face infinity."
