Text: "The pristine lagoons of Rarotonga play host to the some of the most beautiful\
  \ and clear waters in the Cook Islands. Situated north of New Zealand, the 4 hour\
  \ flight from Auckland to Rarotonga's airport is a short trip for most. Arriving\
  \ on the island, you are greeted by warm air, warm smiles and freshly made lei's\
  \ that the locals be-still upon your neck as a humble greeting to their home. \n\
  \nThe island itself is a round trip of approximately 40 minutes and can be explored\
  \ via car, bike, scooter or by foot. With the multitude of cuisine and tourist attractions\
  \ on the island, there is something for everyone. But for myself, and as many others\
  \ like me, my mind and soul was drawn to the sea. \n\nImagine being immersed in\
  \ a world unable to be seen from above. We walk on the land as though it doesn't\
  \ even exist, completely oblivious as to what hides beneath it's canopy. Sitting\
  \ on the bow of the glass bottom boat in the sanctual lagoon of Muri Beach, your\
  \ feet dangle amongst the waves as you glide through the rippled blue waters encompassing\
  \ around you. The motor ceases and the flurry begins. People around you begin to\
  \ find their gear in eager anticipation to enter the water. You are also waiting.\
  \ Staring down the bow of the boat, you can see a shining speck just below your\
  \ feet, but you're unable to make it out. A deep inhale of oxygen engulfs your body,\
  \ holding deep within the base of your diaphragm, your heart begins to make a louder\
  \ presence from within your chest and your pulse is present just below your ears.\
  \ You push yourself forward away from the boat, your body floats in the air, your\
  \ heart skips a beat for a split second and your body becomes immersed beneath the\
  \ canopy of the waters edge. Your last breath stays with you for this moment as\
  \ your flippers hit the water, followed by the rest of your body. You emerge into\
  \ the unseen world of Muri Lagoon. \n\nUnder the water, everything is still. You\
  \ can hear your heart beating, you know you're still alive and this world you're\
  \ envisaging  is not a dream. The sand is white, and coral clusters are scattered\
  \ across the lagoon floor. As you dive deeper, you feel the water cover your body,\
  \ as it slips through your fingers as your pull through the water. Out of the corner\
  \ of your eye, you see the shining speck. A parrot fish. \n\nWith my last breath,\
  \ I immersed myself into an unbeknown world below the water. The parrot fish that\
  \ caught my eye from behind the coral swum up to me and danced around my hands as\
  \ they glided through the water. As I dove deeper, it followed. Before I ascended\
  \ back to the world above, it swum around my arm one more time before we said our\
  \ goodbyes. I ascended, back to my world. \n\nTaking your last breath isn't always\
  \ a negative connotation. I would take multiple last breaths as I re-entered into\
  \ the world below, in the hope to discover more of its hidden secrets and treasures\
  \ that would unfold. Fish of all sizes would emerge from behind the coral and disappear\
  \ as I would come closer.\n\nIn a world hidden away, your last breath can also become\
  \ your hide away for a moment too."
