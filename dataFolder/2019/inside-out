Text: "\u201CDarkness is just light turned inside out.\u201D\n\n--\n\nWe are walking\
  \ through the narrow streets of London that awaken the claustrophobic within. I\
  \ am overwhelmed by the sheer number of bodies on the sidewalk. Head bowed down,\
  \ I examine the stone pavement while British accents hover under the hooded sky.\
  \ My eyes carefully follow my friend\u2019s steps and his occasional finger that\
  \ point to glance-worthy monuments- the ghosts of all the postcards I have collected.\
  \ \n\nSlowly and then all at once, a curious building swallows all of my attention.\
  \ It looks like the insides of the building structure are on the outside, sitting\
  \ bare. \n\nI find it foreign, yet familiar. I am told that this building used be\
  \ a factory and when it was being renovated into a \u201Cmodern\" capitalist member\
  \ of the street, they ran with its original design. \n\nWhen I gaze upon this building,\
  \ I see a character, the character of older London, the industrial soul-sucking\
  \ London. It\u2019s as if history is looking back at me, inside out. \n\nIt reminds\
  \ me of Russian reversal jokes; in America you watch the television, in Russia the\
  \ television watches you. This building is reversed; when you watch it, a part of\
  \ its previous life is watching you.\n\nTo rephrase John Green, sometimes you need\
  \ to look at things reversed because it reveals truths that we might otherwise miss.\n\
  \nShall we need to look at ourselves reversed as well? No skin, no barrier, no protector;\
  \ just organs, veins, and bones. These are the core of our functionality. So does\
  \ it matter how we look beyond our insides? Or should we lay bare, inside out?\n\
  \nInside out building* is my favourite.\n\n--\n\n*This is the Lloyds building, headquarters\
  \ of the insurance company, Lloyds of London."
