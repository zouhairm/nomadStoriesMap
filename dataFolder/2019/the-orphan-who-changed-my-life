Text: "Ahhhh India, you little seductress.   Like a dysfunctional lover, you entice\
  \ the unsuspecting traveler with your promise of other-worldly delights.  However,\
  \ what you fail to reveal in your come-hither calling is the immediate and complete\
  \ assault on one\u2019s senses; which you successfully achieve the moment a flight\
  \ touches down.  The cacophony of noise 24/7, the stifling humidity, the pungent\
  \ scents of curry juxtaposed with the overwhelmingly sweet-scented flower cart \u2013\
  \ all delivering a one-two punch in the face. But then, you embrace in the most\
  \ magnificent loving stronghold.\n\nInvited on a voluntourism trip to India, I was\
  \ truly uncertain about what I was committing to when I allotted my limited vacation\
  \ time and money to work at an orphanage there. But this is how the magic begins,\
  \ doesn\u2019t it? The thrill of adventure and uncertainty.\n \nOur journey to the\
  \ orphanage after arrival entailed a hotel (basic \u2013 but it had clean sheets,\
  \ warm-ish water, rumbling air conditioning and the worst noise insulation on earth),\
  \ a car (left hand driving \u2013 DO NOT HIT A COW), a train (first class is the\
  \ way to go, trust me), a rickshaw (a 3-wheeled, open-air tuk-tuk) and several exhaustive\
  \ moments struggling with the 11.5-hour time difference.  \u201CWhat am I doing\
  \ here?\u201D I asked myself more than once as India repeatedly punched me in the\
  \ face.\n \nOur assignment was to paint the children\u2019s home with glorious color.\
  \  Because, in most Indian orphanages the atomosphere feels more like a jail than\
  \ a home.  There is little color, little air circulation, and sometimes little hope.\
  \  Our team set to work with the children painting colorful mural masterpieces and\
  \ handprints of all the kids on the walls. \n\nThere was a 10-year old girl who\
  \ stole away my heart.  She had coco skin, deep soulful black eyes, and an incorrigible\
  \ little smile.  The entire week she would run to me when we arrived each morning\
  \ on the bus from our nearby hotel.  \u201CAuntie, Auntie, COME\u201D she would\
  \ call out and take me off to see some small accomplishment of which she was proud.\n\
  \ \nThroughout the week we painted walls, painted hands, and virtually painted their\
  \ names across our hearts.  They blossomed under our love. And we, of course, grew\
  \ extremely attached to them.\n\nOn the last night, the kids performed a Bollywood\
  \ dance show and asked us to join them on stage.   Swinging them around, laughing,\
  \ dancing - the evening breeze kissed my skin and, I swear, the earth sent vibrations\
  \ through me. With all her warts and beauty, Mother India warmly and magically embraces,\
  \ if you open your heart to her.\n \nMy tears mixed with the children\u2019s, as\
  \ we hugged one another tightly.  Keep in mind, these children are orphans. Unwanted!\
  \ The \u201Cuntouchables\u201D in their culture. All they own are a change of clothes\
  \ (when one outfit is on, one is being hand washed by a house mother and sun-dried\
  \ in the courtyard), a school uniform, books for school and a plate for meals. \
  \ Their few other worldly possessions are shared.  The girls have little bits of\
  \ jewelry made of plastic or cheap metal. Because let\u2019s face it, what is an\
  \ Indian girl without bangles?\n\nOn that magical last night after dances and endless\
  \ hugs, my girl pulled me aside from the madness. I crouched down to talk to her\
  \ and she made me open my hand and put it in front of her.  She tugged the little\
  \ blue heart off her plastic beaded necklace and placed it in the palm of my hand.\
  \ She closed my fingers around it and put her little hand over my fist and said,\
  \ \u201CAuntie, Auntie, so you will never forget me.\u201D I was choked with emotion\
  \ in a way no other child had ever made me feel. Like I would EVER forget her? \
  \ I hugged her close and whispered in her ear a \u201Cthank you\u201D which came\
  \ out like a croak, I was so overwhelmed.  When someone who owns NOTHING gives you\
  \ something, your paradigms shift in the most powerful way.  That day I realized\
  \ she did not have \u201Cnothing\u201D, she was filled with love. Teaching me the\
  \ best lesson I could ever learn. \n\nAhhhhh India, you little seductress!"
