Text: "A ten day trip to the land of the Prophets of  worlds largest Religion, the\
  \ Islam in Saudi Arabia. My travel story started from Dubai. The difficulties of\
  \ going to Saudi Arabia as tourist is very obvious if you are entering without any\
  \ legal sponsorship. specially for those aren't a muslim. so then because im a muslim\
  \ its a bit easier for me to travel inside Saudi Arabia with the bookings from authorized\
  \ agency to the kingdom. i manage to get a ten days Umrah package for a lower price.\
  \ with hotel and land travel from Dubai to makkah. What makes exciting for this\
  \ trip is the road trip that takes for more than 24 hours to reach the holy place\
  \ of Makkah in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. there are several stop over including\
  \ the border for passport and visa clearing and luggage checking. everyone in the\
  \ bus where patiently waiting until we reach the holy place of Makkah. this is ass\
  \ well my first time to be in the Kingdom so excitement is normal. i was only watching\
  \ in the television of what is happening inside the Mosque of Masjid Al Haram where\
  \ thousands of pilgrims walking around the Black Stone. people were trying to kiss\
  \ and touch the holy stones and door. goosebumps as i see the holy stone. i feel\
  \ a different atmosphere of holiness inside me. managing to touch the stone is a\
  \ challenge. and make it myself as well but not the stone with the silver coverings.\
  \ inside Masnid Al Hatam there are pilgrims who are prividing small meals to the\
  \ other pilgrims who came from different country. you can really feel the original\
  \ spirit of islam. the beauty of this place and its holiness will last untill the\
  \ end of time. its the people and the religion itself preserving this very unique\
  \ and indescribable place. \nafter spending 4 days in Makkah we move to the Prophet\
  \ Muhammad 's place. the Madina. of how incredible you will describe the Makkah,\
  \ Madina will mesmerize your sight. along the way to madina you can see glamours\
  \ of the Saudi' s natural beauty. endless mountain and plains. its not a desert\
  \ as what it is describe in the school. it is ended a beauty never known to everybody.\
  \ as we reach madina and saw the Masjid An Nabwe i was in shock. i thought i was\
  \ already in heaven. this is the most beautiful and the most glamorous Mosque i\
  \ have ever seen in my life.  coming to this place will never make you think of\
  \ going anywhere anymore. i myself think of not coming back to dubai. i could die\
  \ in this place r maybe i could stay in madina until the day i die. but its just\
  \ a dream for eveybody, specially if you are not a Saudian National. \ninside the\
  \ masjid An Nabwe you can see great history of the this great nation. not only religiously\
  \ historical the place but also nationaly and geographically historic. the architecture\
  \ and the engineerings of this masjid will make you thing whether normal himans\
  \ or aliens have ever planned and contruct this majestic structure. the umbrellas\
  \ outside the Mosque An Nabwe will mark to your mind until the day you die watching\
  \ it blossoming in the early morning and closing in the afternoon. its magical beauty\
  \ perfectly engineered is a proof itself that this religions and this people the\
  \ muslims were truly blessed and guoded by the most powerful and most Benevolent\
  \ God. Allah. \nThe people in madina is the real example of islamic religion. doing\
  \ what the real muslim is doing and living. indeed the holy place is always the\
  \ holiest among holy's in the world. the Makkah and Madina. sorrounded by Sands\
  \ and Stone is the most beautiful and holy place everyone should see. \nI am a filino,\
  \ a natural born christian,but found the real truth in the arms of the muslims.\
  \ i was a convert not encouraged but motivated by the essence of the real people\
  \ who show me the truth and the real life of the real muslims. the Sands and Stone\
  \ maybe not so precious but makes a strong foundation same as religions."
