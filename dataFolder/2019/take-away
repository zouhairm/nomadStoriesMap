Text: "I cupped my hands together and in a sweeping motion, as if I were using them\
  \ as a shovel, explained in English to my new-found friend in Granada, Spain, \u201C\
  take\u2026away.\u201D Omar was a Moroccan immigrant working at the restaurant I\
  \ was ordering food from. To my amusement, he spoke little English and Spanish,\
  \ but was very eager to demonstrate his fluency in Arabic. Exhausted from my Cordoba\
  \ expedition earlier in the day, this hand motion was my feeble attempt to explain\
  \ to Omar that I wanted my food \u201Cto go\u201D \u2013 as we call it in the United\
  \ States. At first, he greeted me with a puzzled look when he saw my hand motions,\
  \ and then, with a wide smile, he mirrored the same action I just performed and\
  \ repeated after me. \n\nAs we both laughed at our inability to understand one another,\
  \ Omar\u2019s mother burst from the kitchen doors and, observing our hand motions,\
  \ immediately understood what I wanted. She reached behind the counter to take out\
  \ the all too familiar clear plastic container, smiled, and pointed to it. Excited\
  \ at the breakthrough, I nodded my head in approval. It turned out that Omar\u2019\
  s mother knew a bit more English than Omar, and we started to converse as she prepared\
  \ the food.\n\nI shared with her that this was my first trip to Spain coming from\
  \ New York City. She let out a \u201Cwow,\u201D knowing how far I had come, and\
  \ said \u201Cme, not too far, from Morocco.\u201D I had prepared myself to greet\
  \ the locals in my 10-day Spain trip, but little did I expect myself to make friends\
  \ with Moroccans living in Spain. The restaurant was seemingly out of place with\
  \ its interior full of Islamic art, deep red ottomans, and cherry wood dining tables\
  \ contrasting against the gray cobblestone streets and Catholic church looming over\
  \ the small restaurant. Yet, the bustling crowd inside showed that the Spanish community\
  \ had embraced the restaurant. Omar\u2019s mother was proud to share with me that\
  \ the restaurant was owned by her family, who had worked hard over the years to\
  \ make it a part of the neighborhood. \n\nTheir assimilation in Spain reminded me\
  \ of Cordoba\u2019s history, shaped through a blend of influences from the Romans,\
  \ Moors, and Catholics. Walking on the Roman Bridge of Cordoba earlier in the day,\
  \ I was treated to a warm, red-orange sunset that filled the rivers with its hues\
  \ and highlighted the Moorish arches outlining the bridge. Stepping inside the Cordoba\
  \ Cathedral-Mosque, with its dimly lit, hollow, and expansive interior echoing the\
  \ footsteps of passersby, I learned that the eight hundred or so pillars within\
  \ were from the original Roman structure it was built upon, which were then later\
  \ embellished by the Moors and Catholics. The open-air courtyard was laced with\
  \ bright green grass, pebbled stone walkways, and pops of neon from the sour oranges\
  \ found on the trees planted by the Moors.  Towering above it all, a former Islamic\
  \ minaret now functioning as a bell tower.\n\nImmigration has recently become a\
  \ polarizing issue around the world, yet being in Spain made me realize how differing\
  \ cultures of the past (Cordoba) and present (Omar\u2019s Moroccan restaurant) can\
  \ borrow and enhance each other\u2019s surroundings. Content in my reflection while\
  \ I waited for the food, Omar looked at me as I held onto my cell phone, smiled,\
  \ and uttered a phrase that unifies cultures in present day, \u201CYou want Wi-Fi\
  \ password?\u201D"
