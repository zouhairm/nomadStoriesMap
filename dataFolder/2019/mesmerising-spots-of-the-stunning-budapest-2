Text: "Spending three days there, my friend and I finally knew the joy of living in\
  \ a Hungarian hostel. It was wonderful, apart of couples that slept together and\
  \ did something that they should not do in front of other people. As girls who came\
  \ from a country where religion is a must, it was very surprising for us. In other\
  \ words, we also found the dread and discomfort of living in that small building\
  \ where you must stay with another seven people in a room. Bravo, cheap backpacking!\n\
  \nI simply could not stop playing with a night lamp beside my bed. The made-in-China\
  \ stamp made me so proud for some reasons. Maybe it was because I can easily find\
  \ made-in-China stuffs in my country Indonesia. So it made me feel like home. \n\
  \nOur journey began at the day after we reached Budapest. We found this city cool\
  \ and fascinating. What sets it apart from the rest of the world was of course the\
  \ city's personalities that offered very different atmospheres. Buda is a place\
  \ for people who love to discover calm and relaxing city. It was away from the crowds,\
  \ while Pest is a place of people with modern life, shopaholic travelers, and culinary\
  \ hunters. In short, no matter where in Budapest you are situated, you must have\
  \ a stop there to see natural places, cultures, and modern life. \n\nOur first destination\
  \ in Budapest is the amazing Hosok Tere or Heroes' Square.  It is a place where\
  \ they put iconic statues of seven Magyar's leaders, the national leaders of Hungary.\
  \ \n\nStanding at a small path next to Hosok Tere made me feel like living in an\
  \ area with two seasons at the same time. At my right side, a frozen lake used as\
  \ a place for skiing. There are hundred of people playing there. It was definitely\
  \ a picture of winter. At the left, there are trees with brown leaves that fall\
  \ off to the ground. There were no snow. It was like autumn, a season that many\
  \ people admire so much.\n\nAnother extraordinary place to see in Budapest was Vadjahunyad,\
  \ a stunning castle stood at the center of the city park. It is one of the most\
  \ popular tourist attraction in Hungary. There, again, I found other interesting\
  \ things. One of them is The Anonymous Szobor, a statue of a robed figure with his\
  \ head covered in a hat. It is a picture of an author of the early story of the\
  \ Magyar Nation. \n\nAs a big fan of old and artsy churches, I also found Jaki Chapel\
  \ just a few meters walking from the mysterious Anonymous Szobor. It is the only\
  \ heritage of Hungarian monasteries in the Middle Ages, built in Roman style and\
  \ is an important part of Hungarian architecture. \n\nIt was a satisfying journey\
  \ at the city park. My friend and I decided to find Hungarian restaurant and have\
  \ some lunch there.  On our way, we saw a big old building. My friend thought it\
  \ was a museum, I did not agree with her. It looked more like a state office for\
  \ me, but that was interesting to see many people, including children, entered the\
  \ 'state office' without being checked. So, my friend and I tried to get into the\
  \ building. When we got in, I saw the innocent face of my friend, shocked to realize\
  \ it was a hot spring. I either gave her the same expression. \n\nWow! Budapest\
  \ really amazed me, both with its nature and architecture."
