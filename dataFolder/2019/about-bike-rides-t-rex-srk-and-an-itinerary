Text: "Blue. That was the dominant color that stretched in front of me for miles,\
  \ as my sister and I started our bike ride on the roads (read cliffs) of Nusa Penida\
  \ \u2013 an island southeast of Bali. We were on a 10-day trip to Bali with a packed\
  \ itinerary. For Nusa Penida, we had: Kelingking Beach, Broken Bridge, Angel\u2019\
  s Billabong, Atuh Beach and indulge in local food at Warungs.\n\nOur second day\
  \ started with a breakfast of pancakes with banana and black coffee. As I scrapped\
  \ off last of my pancake and sat back sipping coffee \u2013 I realized there is\
  \ nowhere else I would rather be than overlooking the Sun rising above the Indian\
  \ Ocean, littered with tiny colorful dots of single-mast dinghies racing the winds.\
  \ The tides crashing on the shore called me out of the balcony for just one dip.\
  \ But like a Siren's song, the list called upon us. \n\nSoon, we were driving towards\
  \ our first destination \u2013 Kelingking beach, zipping and navigating through\
  \ the steep cliffs. Nature had me entranced such that I did not notice the scooter\
  \ in front had hit the brakes, and my sister followed suit. This action led to a\
  \ reaction of me being thrown on the road and in the process, I had grazed both\
  \ my knees bloody. Luckily, we located a medical shop, a few kilometers away enabling\
  \ us to clean and bandage my wound. Within an hour, with resolve, we were back on\
  \ the road. I did not want to start our trip with a hiccup!\n\nThe moment I saw\
  \ the T-Rex \u2013 it dared us, called us out to trek down the cliff. However, my\
  \ knees were screaming for rest. Walking normally, seemed like an uphill trek to\
  \ me. So, with a heavy heart but logical mind, I told others to continue, while\
  \ I rest with my Murakami.\n\nAfter clicking the mandatory photographs with T-Rex,\
  \ I sat in one of the cafes with a bag of chips, brooding over the fact that I might\
  \ not be able to cross off all the places from the itinerary. I felt dejected since\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t be able to see the white sand hidden beneath the T-Rex, forming\
  \ the belly of the Dinosaur. It was then when the strained words from a Bollywood\
  \ song \u2018Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\u2019 penetrated my eardrums, interfering with my\
  \ heavy thoughts that weighed me down. I looked around searching for the source\
  \ of music when I spotted these two Balinese kids dancing to the steps of Bollywood\
  \ song and trying to lip-sync.\n\nAs I walked towards them, they grew shy and stopped\
  \ dancing. In an effort to put them at ease, I started singing the same song. Hearing\
  \ me sing, a group of people nearby joined us and without intending to we had started\
  \ a singing competition!\n\nWhile singing with them, it hit me \u2013 I was so caught\
  \ up with my itinerary, that I did not even take a moment to just sit and marvel\
  \ at the clouds drifting over the ocean or watch the other traveler and tourist\
  \ pose for a photograph or be astounded by their drone maneuvering skill trying\
  \ to capture a perfect video. Then came my epiphany \u2013 one can find more enriching\
  \ experience by just living in the moment. There is a virtue in slowing down and\
  \ not bothering to be at all the places. Leaving a tick-off from the list is more\
  \ endearing than anything else. \n\nThis trip offered many things, but I was not\
  \ ready to find these in Bali: Firstly, a liberating moment, stopping my worry of\
  \ following the itinerary. Secondly, such ardent fans of Bollywood\u2019s SRK in\
  \ Indonesia and, moreover, the ones who can sing a song so perfectly from a late\
  \ 90\u2019s movie!\n\nAs I continued to sit and stared out at the T-Rex with the\
  \ \u2018Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\u2019 blaring from the makeshift caf\xE9, I was drawn\
  \ to the words of WH Davies\u2019 Leisure \u2013\n\nWhat is this life if, full of\
  \ care,\nWe have no time to stand and stare.\n\nNeedless to say, there were a lot\
  \ of other places that I let go off from my itinerary \u2013 that, however, is another\
  \ story to narrate, for another time."
