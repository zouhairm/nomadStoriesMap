Text: "I am standing in the middle of an impressive area, that resembles the moon.\
  \ I am looking around me and there are no plants, only rock and sand. The blue sky\
  \ is diving into the sea at a great distance, at what I know is a height of almost\
  \ 3000 meters. The views are breathtaking. It has been worth every single minute\
  \ of hiking uphill with a heavy backpack on my back. The feeling of reaching the\
  \ top of Mount Olympus is exhilarating. Across from the plateau where I am standing\
  \ \u2013 which is named after the Muses, the inspirational goddesses of literature,\
  \ science and the arts \u2013 I see at another 200 meters height, the throne of\
  \ Zeus. The father of all ancient Gods in Greek Mythology. All the myths I had read\
  \ when I was a child, come to life right at that moment. I can see Zeus fighting\
  \ with his wife Goddess Hera, because he had cheated on her once again. I can see\
  \ the goddess of beauty, Aphrodite, sit in front of a large mirror, brushing her\
  \ beautiful hear. And her brother Hermes, with his magical shoes with wings, flying\
  \ around and delivering messages. That solid rock I am looking at, has stood there\
  \ for thousands of years. And the Gods have lived there ever since. Its form really\
  \ does resemble a large throne. \u201COf course it would, because the father of\
  \ all Gods, wouldn\u2019t accept any less than that enormous throne. As a true ruler,\
  \ looking over the whole world\u201D, I hear myself thinking. No wonder the Muses\
  \ inspired human beings. When standing up here, all you want to do is express yourself.\
  \ The silence around you is soothing. It allows you to get in touch with your thoughts,\
  \ feelings, creativity and everything you have been hiding inside you. \nWe started\
  \ out the journey two days earlier, at 1000 meters, where we parked our cars and\
  \ set out for this adventure. Hiking uphill 2000 meters was a challenge, to say\
  \ the least. The scenery was fabulous, starting out with green forests up till 2000\
  \ meters and ending up in an alpine moon-like landscape at the top. Every step you\
  \ take, takes you further away from the little village at sea level, Litochoro,\
  \ there where it all started. While hiking I turn around occasionally, to admire\
  \ the amazing view. The higher up you go, the greater the distance to everyday worries,\
  \ stresses and problems. The first thing you let go of, is your dependency to your\
  \ mobile connection and the internet. It is just not available anymore. Then, suddenly,\
  \ all worries go away. You become one with nature and your body tunes in to the\
  \ vibes of the mountain. You can feel your body belong there, in the middle of literally\
  \ nowhere. All that is important now, is finding your next meal to eat, keeping\
  \ yourself warm and adequately hydrated. \n\nOnce at the top, everything else seems\
  \ so small and insignificant. It is a clear and beautiful sunny summer day. From\
  \ up there you can see half of Greece in every direction. Later, it is a very cold\
  \ and clear night. Up there, the stars seem so much closer to earth and all of us\
  \ seem so unimportant and small. Does anything that seems important in our daily\
  \ lives, matter as much as we think? Work and deadlines and the endless running\
  \ around all day to get everything done in time? And what is the concept of time\
  \ anyway? Does it even exist? \n\nVisiting the top of Mount Olympus has a certain\
  \ effect on you, that stays with you, even after you return to your everyday hectic\
  \ life. From now on, whenever the world overwhelms you, all you need to do, is mentally\
  \ return to that happy place for a short moment; there you can find your lost peace\
  \ and harmony. And then you realize that you have found something you probably didn\u2019\
  t even know you were looking for up there: your true self, hiding deep inside you.\
  \ The great part is, it is with you everywhere, as long as you take the time to\
  \ listen to it!"
