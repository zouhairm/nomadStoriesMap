Text: "When I signed up to travel across 6 districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over 5\
  \ days with a group of volunteers to spread awareness on the roles of parliamentarians\
  \ in ensuring better education in the province leading up to the national elections,\
  \ my biggest concern was not knowing the people I was travelling with well enough.\
  \ Little did I know, it would leave me with a friendship I will cherish for years\
  \ to come. \n\nI had been restless throughout the trip, having gone through anxiety\
  \ my entire life. But by day 3, I looked as haggard as I felt. My exam results were\
  \ due and I had no way of finding out before I reached Karachi. Suddenly I felt\
  \ someone take my hand and ask me if everything was alright. I looked up to find\
  \ Shazmeen, a teacher at the school in Haripur that we were visiting that day. I\
  \ found myself telling her about why I was fretting.\n\n\u2018You remind me of my\
  \ daughter Rubina. She lives in Islamabad where she\u2019s attending university.\
  \ You worry like her\u2019, her eyes crinkle. \u2018Tell you what? If you\u2019\
  re done with today\u2019s sessions, why don\u2019t you come with me and I\u2019\
  ll show you around. I\u2019ll be sure to drop you back at the school in time.\u2019\
  \ I\u2019d never thought I\u2019d say yes but here I was, telling the rest of the\
  \ group I was going to catch up with them later. \n\nI get on a horse cart that\
  \ Shazmeen used for her daily commute and for the first time in the day, I take\
  \ in the majestic Tanawal Hills and just like that, all my stress vanishes into\
  \ the ether. We make it to her charming little house between maize fields where\
  \ Shazmeen\u2019s rams are waiting to welcome us. \u2018I\u2019d offer you lunch\
  \ here but I promise where I\u2019m taking you is worth the wait,\u2019 she says\
  \ as she quickly packs some fruit and a blanket. \n\nWe\u2019re off again, this\
  \ time to meet her husband Rehman, a fisherman who worked along the edges of the\
  \ Tarbela Lake. I\u2019m overwhelmed as I take in the scene in front of me, from\
  \ the azure water to the colorful boats and the hustle and bustle of the day. After\
  \ Shazmeen explains the surprise guest who accompanied her, I see Rehman beckoning\
  \ me over. He is warm too, like the sun peaking from the hills as he signals the\
  \ waiter from the dhaba and tells me that we\u2019re having Rohu fish fry and that\
  \ I will love it. Rehman is absolutely right. \n\nThere is something about the air\
  \ in Haripur that made everything feel as light as the clouds above. Shazmeen teases\
  \ me good-naturedly during lunch about my morning and tells her husband of how much\
  \ I remind her of Rubina. I see Rehman get misty-eyed and suddenly it feels very\
  \ much like dinner in Karachi with my parents. Never missing a beat, Shazmeen puts\
  \ her arm around me while Rehman implores me to eat more. \n\nSome apple slices\
  \ later, Rehman urges me towards the lake shore where he\u2019s firing up his boat.\
  \ Shazmeen picks up the blanket and wraps it around me the minute I board it. For\
  \ the next 30 minutes, no one talks as we make our way through the lake. Soon enough,\
  \ the sounds from the engine die out too as Rehman stops in the middle of the lake\
  \ and Shazmeen dips her toes in the water. \n\nWe all sit and I can\u2019t remember\
  \ when I last felt so at peace as we talk about my trip and life back in Karachi,\
  \ Shazmeen\u2019s life in Haripur, Rehman\u2019s favorite spots growing up and Rubina\
  \ finishing her studies. We\u2019re quiet again as we make our way back to the shore\
  \ around sunset and to the school where my driver\u2019s come to pick me. Shazmeen\
  \ and I exchange numbers and she tells me that I\u2019ll be in her prayers. I\u2019\
  m overcome with gratitude for this quaint sweet woman. The same woman who is the\
  \ second person after my mother to know my results, making me realize of how things\
  \ come to be when and where you least expect to find them."
