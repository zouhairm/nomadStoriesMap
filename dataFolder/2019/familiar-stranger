Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s cold, isn\u2019t it?\u201D a woman spoke to us after I complained\
  \ about Busan\u2019s weather in Indonesian language. She flashing her smile between\
  \ her chubby cheek.\n\n\u201CAre you girls Indonesian?\u201D Yes, we replied. \n\
  \n\u201CWhere do you girls want to go? I\u2019m planning to go for dinner, why don\u2019\
  t you join?\u201D \n\nWe looked at each other, quite taken a back. It\u2019s not\
  \ surprising to find an Indonesian in South Korea, but to find one that would make\
  \ their way to talk to you -and even asked to join her for dinner, is one rare event.\
  \ We were quite hesitant, because this kind of situation could lead to two possibilities;\
  \ either fun or awkward. We concluded that it could lead to the later, so we told\
  \ her that we were planning to eat at an Italian restaurant recommended by the hostel.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYou are in Korea and you want to eat Italian food?\u201D asked her followed\
  \ with laughter, made her eye looks smaller. Well, she got a point.\n\n\u201CLet\u2019\
  s eat together. I\u2019m gonna get my husband first,\u201D\n\nWe then followed the\
  \ woman and her husband in search for night feast. She introduce herself as Vivi.\
  \ Tante Vivi, as we call her, said that she was on vacation with her family. She\
  \ lets her two daughters went on shopping spree, while she rest her worn out knees\
  \ at the hostel. \u201CI\u2019m already old,\u201D she laugh. We took our turn to\
  \ introduce ourselves. We told her that we were college friends on holiday. We tried\
  \ to squeeze in opportunities to travel together before life gets in the way.\n\n\
  \u201CHow nice!\u201D she said, \u201Cit\u2019s really sweet of you to keep in touch\
  \ after all those years.\u201D Yes, it is.\n\nAfter contemplating between Dakgalbi\
  \ restaurant or seafood store, we settled on a street stall that look like they\
  \ sell affordable korean delicacies instead. It was a humble stall that occupied\
  \ half of roundabout. The waiters were busy as almost all table were filled by locals,\
  \ ending their day either alone or with friends. The menu was displayed on big banner\
  \ that double functioned as cover. They offered some standard Korean foods, like\
  \ ramyeon, kimbab, tonkatsu, and kimchi fried rice. We ordered our foods and continued\
  \ the conversation while waiting.\n\nTante Vivi started with story of her life;\
  \ about her family, her daugthers, and her friends. She also told us about how he\
  \ met her husband, and how they started everything from zero. \u201CI\u2019m not\
  \ a smart person. I\u2019m only a high school graduate. But, I tried my best at\
  \ everything, and just pray to God,\u201D reminisced her.  We also talked about\
  \ political issues back home, as there will be election the next year. I started\
  \ to regret my choice of food. I ordered a bowl of Nangmyeon to beat the cold, but\
  \ sadly, it tasted quite bland, and the conversation was getting juicier than my\
  \ food. I stuffed myself with Oden instead, while listening Tante Vivi elaborated\
  \ her choice of President. \n\n \u201CSo, where will you go after this?\u201D asked\
  \ her. We told her that we hesitated between called it a day or go to Gwangalli\
  \ Beach. We just arrived that evening after all, and there were a packed schedule\
  \ ahead of us. We paid our bills and bid goodbye to Tante Vivi and her husband.\n\
  \n\u201CJust go! You are still young!\u201D encouraged her for the last time. We\
  \ just laughed, but actually took her advice to heart.\n\nBy the end of the dinner,\
  \ I learned two things : you\u2019ve got to make the most of everything. So, while\
  \ we were in Busan, might as well go to Gwangalli Beach despite the clock strike\
  \ midnight. The second thing is that Oden is really expensive."
