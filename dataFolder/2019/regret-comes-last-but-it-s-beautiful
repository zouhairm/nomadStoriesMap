Text: "I went to Australia as an International Students for 6 years. \n\nAt first,\
  \ i was purely stunned by the beauty; the air so clear you can feel your lungs become\
  \ healthier by the minutes to inhale (i cam from an urban city where pollution is\
  \ so bad people needs air purifier in rooms), the view so novel with blocks of old\
  \ buildings and history, trees everywhere reminding me that urban is not just bricks.\
  \ \n\nThen i've spent the next 6 years trying to stay, to keep all that. And i forget\
  \ how to enjoy them. \n\nLike all regrets, it came last. I failed to stay. I returned\
  \ to my home country. I cursed every second of the flight. I hate. Hate. Hate. I\
  \ don't want to go back to that awful city that raised me. \n\nI have yet to give\
  \ up. I joined a company promising me a chance of working abroad. I worked as hard\
  \ as i can, and i let them place me in any places they wanted. I went from Bali,\
  \ Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Surabaya and Palembang. I work as a salesman and an analyst.\
  \ I tried and tried, with that image of crisp air and romantic old buildings to\
  \ fuel my effort. \n\nAnd now, i regret how foolish i have been. \n\nThe cities\
  \ i despised slowly makes me like them. Nay, love them. I started to see the beautiful\
  \ people around me, with the same language i spoken since birth, opening their home\
  \ to me. Strangers sharing kindness and helping me. I walk through the blue green\
  \ beaches i used to look down upon and realised, hey this is very beautiful. And\
  \ the pollution that used to haunt me, slowly became a norm and romantic thing (yes,\
  \ its not good still, but i learned that it is beautiful. I became more appreciative\
  \ when a big rain came and it clears out the \nCo2 fogs). \n\nI am now in Palembang,\
  \ one of the oldest cities in Indonesia. Despite people telling me how unsafe it\
  \ was for a single girl, i found comraderie in small places. Like the store owner\
  \ where i sell my products to gave me a pack of dukuh (seasonal local fruit), my\
  \ local coworker telling me about tit and bits of local secret (the cheapest and\
  \ most delicious pempek maker), and to appreciate that life doesn't need to be luxurious\
  \ or sophisticated ala scandinavian; this slow life, walking from sidewalk alongside\
  \ the river or the LRT rail is also an adventure too. \n\nWhere else can you walk\
  \ on sideways to find a small crocodiles blinking lazily under the sun? \n\nI found\
  \ myself back, in the country i used to look down upon and despise. \n\nRegret comes\
  \ last, but its beautiful."
