Text: So, I do have family in Peru but I decided to try and live there. My plan was
  to stay there for 6 months and save up money. Turns out you can't make a lot of
  money working as a nonresident so I came back home after 3 months. However, this
  was the first time in my life I attempt to move away from home. I grew up in Hawaii
  and that's all I really know as far as living and supporting yourself somewhere
  goes. Peru thought me to be independent and toughen up. Everyone in Hawaii is so
  nice I had to learn how to speak up when someone would be rude to me. I ended up
  talking a Spanish class at there language school for 2months. It was great! I made
  3 friends there all from different parts of the world. One from Hungary, the other
  from Lebanon and the past from Turkey. We would go out to lunch together and offen
  out at night. It was a nice way for me get to see a part of Peru I never seen before.
  I would visit often with my dad as a kid but never really got to adventure as much
  I wanted to. I feel like I found myself in Peru. At least found my potential to
  be something more in this life. To truly be part of something bigger than myself.
  It really inspired me to work towards becoming the best version of myself. Now back
  in Hawaii I plan on getting school done so I can help people. My goal is to become
  a holistic doctor one day.
