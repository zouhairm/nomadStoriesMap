Text: "Do you believe in the magic of an encounter destined to happen? I didn\u2019\
  t until I lived it.\n\n\u201CDo you know someone in Paris who can give me accommodation?\u201D\
  \ I asked that question to some friends in Barcelona in a study afternoon, while\
  \ we were having a drink in some cute cafeteria. I had purchased the flight in a\
  \ great offer of 22 euros round, but it was half of my year and my scholarship for\
  \ the second semester had not yet arrived.\n\nTrite or not, Paris was my dream since\
  \ I was 15 years old. To know the city of light was the hidden motive of this decision\
  \ to study a master. I could not lose the opportunity, but I didn\u2019t want to\
  \ get lost in the fear of having to sleep in any random park.\n\nA friend of my\
  \ friend was the brave one who said yes, despite not knowing me. That\u2019s what\
  \ happens when, far from your country, you meet people who, just like you, look\
  \ for any opportunity to make new friends and surround themselves with them to feel\
  \ at home. I never saw him in person because for that date he had another trip,\
  \ all our deal was through social networks, where he told me he would leave the\
  \ key to his room with a classmate, to whom I would have to return when I left,\
  \ 4 day later.\n\nFavors are not charged, although you should always be ready to\
  \ pay for them, and a couple of months later I went from being a guest to become\
  \ a host. He contacted me again to tell me that he would go to Barcelona and asked\
  \ if it was possible that I would receive him, I said of course! When the agreed\
  \ date arrive, at midnight, he knocked on the door of my building and I found a\
  \ globetrotter. Honestly, the hour was not conducive to conversation and my body\
  \ screamed for going to sleep, but something at that moment kept me in the room\
  \ while he talked about the history of himself.\n\nMy work as a tourist guide of\
  \ the city that I fallen in love with, was exhausting; but after the grandeur of\
  \ the Sagrada Familia, the tranquility of Park G\xFCelll, the energy of the Parque\
  \ de la Ciudadela with the Arc of Triomf crowning it, the bustle of the dancing\
  \ fountains of Montjuic and the traditional walk along the Ramblas, we arrive at\
  \ Barceloneta, beach that witnessed one of the best night of my life.\n\nChatting\
  \ was so easy, it seemed we knew each other since 20 years ago, the conversation\
  \ was still flowing even with silences that were anything but uncomfortable, I was\
  \ so transparent and I told him about me without thinking too much, because his\
  \ energy was so natural that I could see myself reflected in him, in his profound\
  \  black eyes, his big smile and in that free way of thinking that invited me to\
  \ enjoy life. That night we connect in such a way that even today we cannot explain\
  \ it - it is ours-, that magic will stay with me all my life because even remembering\
  \ it makes me sigh.\n\nHowever, everything has an ending and that night would also\
  \ have it because he has to go back to Paris. The farewell was bittersweet, we both\
  \ still thinking about what was happened without saying it aloud, but the train\
  \ arrived and I saw the doors closing while we said goodbye through the window asking\
  \ ourselves if we would see each other again.\n\nThe answer came soon because one\
  \ month later he returned to my apartment and that visit was repeated a couple of\
  \ months later, before I finish my year at Barcelona and have to return to my country.\n\
  \nThree times we saw each other and they were not more than 12 days in total, but\
  \ I learn that there are people who stay in our mind, settle in our heart, touch\
  \ our soul to enlighten it and simply become part of us. They remain through the\
  \ time and despite the distance, or at least I know he will."
