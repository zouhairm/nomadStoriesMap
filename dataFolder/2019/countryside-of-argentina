Text: "Hello ! My name's Ignacio Bassano and I'm from Argentina. I'm 24 years old\
  \ and I'm currently studing for music teacher in my hometown, Mar del Plata and\
  \ I play bass guitar, guitar, a little keyboard and drums. I love to travel too\
  \ and since I've been on Elementary school I went on travel with my family going\
  \ to San Carlos de Bariloche, Cordoba, Mendoza, Puerto Iguazu, and some other places.\
  \ But I got really surprised when I visited with my ex-girlfriend the town of ''El\
  \ Bolson'' and ''Lago Puelo'' down in Patagonia. Those places were totally stunning:\
  \ inmense mountains and lakes, vasts forests in the middle of nowhere, really nice\
  \ hippie vibes and interesting prices. We stayed in some super cool Hostel called\
  \ ''Universal Travellers Lodge'' and we met people from Brazil, Germany, USA, and\
  \ of course, people from Buenos Aires (They're everywhere). We rented a bike and\
  \ we went ciclying to Puelo Lake (like 13 milles) and some other countryside places\
  \ entering Chubut Province. Also we went to ''El Hoyo'', a dreamlike village in\
  \ the middle of the mountains with some nice small waterfall near there; and to\
  \ ''Colonia Suiza'' (Swiss Colony) a small village too near Bariloche Town with\
  \ really good beer in sale. \n\nMe and my ex girlfriend back then (2017) were really\
  \ in Love! and that travel was like the height of our relashionship. (Sadly some\
  \ time later we took differents paths) .\n \nI seriously recommend going to Patagonia\
  \ ! \n\n\nIgnacio\n\n[email\_protected]"
