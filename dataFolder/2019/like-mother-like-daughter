Text: "It is a strort of a mother and daughter\u2019s travel journey, a trip to Delhi\
  \ & Agra. It is a story of a beautiful young mother ( La bella ) ., who saw Taj\
  \ Mahal one of the Seven Wonders of the World, with her new eyes. It is an experience\
  \ of a mother & daughters fun trip with lots of hilarious fun, ups & downs, enthusiastic,\
  \ loving and caring. It\u2019s a journey of that mother who has struggled throughout\
  \ her life and her daughter wants to give her all the happiness as much as she can.\n\
  It was a whole new experience for the mother like flying in the sky for the first\
  \ time, the chase of window seat , living in the 5 star , seeing the wonder of the\
  \ world , historical places which she read in her school books ( qutub minar ) ,\
  \ etc . She was so fascinated by the historical fairy tales that she was just into\
  \ it . The relationship that mother daughter shares in the story is like a bond\
  \ of best friends forever. It was cozy winter time and perfect travel time with\
  \ less of expenditure with more fun . A journey worthwhile in a city of unknowns."
