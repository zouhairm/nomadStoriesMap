Text: "Here is my first writing and i am truly enjoyed writing since few weeks ago\
  \ and I want to write more because writing is able to create an extraordinary and\
  \ memorable work . I went to France in June, 18th  2017 also the same date on my\
  \ 19th birthday. I arrived in Paris then I was not expected to received some nice\
  \ birthday greetings from the immigration officers. They were even singing me a\
  \ birthday song in English and French version. What a day that I will obviously\
  \ remember in my life. After passing the airport, I finally had some time to rest\
  \ in an apartment by enjoying the view from the balcony. The buildings, the streets,\
  \ the weather were so amazing because it was also my first trip to Europe. \nThe\
  \ next day I went for food hunting, and I had my first baguette. I wonder what could\
  \ I add on the baguette to make it more tasty, and was hoping to get a smoother\
  \ bread because I have never ate a real bread such as baguette which has hard texture.\
  \ Everytime I entered a shop, the shopkeepers were saying \u201Cbonjour\u201D which\
  \ means hello at the entry and \u201Cau revoir, bonne journ\xE9e\u201D which means\
  \ goodbye, have a nice day at the exit. Few times I was not saying anything except\
  \ smile to them but then I realized that I should have saying that too. The next\
  \ days I finally used to that and feeling excited, so I said to every shopkeeper\
  \ I met. \nI tried Escargot, it is made of Snails cooked with garlic butter, wine\
  \ or chicken stock and some sauce for serving. I was doubting myself to order it\
  \ because it looks greeny, fishy-smells and watery a bit. But once it served and\
  \ I was amazed that It was super delicious, fresh, and literally not smell fishy\
  \ at all. No wonder why it becomes one of the most favorite foods in France by the\
  \ price it is not really expensive but worth it. \nThe first time I met some french\
  \ people in person and they were doing \u201Cla bise\u201D which a custom that is\
  \ related as greeting by giving double kiss each other on the cheek for two women,\
  \ women and men and even for two men, especially for the older generation. It was\
  \ obviously the thing I have never expected to find it anywhere such as tradition\
  \ or a habit. Because the country where I live, Indonesia we used to shaking hands\
  \ or just waving our hands each other while saying \u201Chey\u201D.  La bise It\
  \ is a good thing we should keep doing it because it shows respect in a way of society.\
  \ I spent 3 months in France and those unexpected things that happened in my trip\
  \ were amazing."
