Text: "This trip was awesome and a very special one for me, your first time volunteering\
  \ you never forget. It happened in 2015 when I  was 17 years old and basically,\
  \ without my parents, I decided to go on a volunteer and missionary trip with a\
  \ few friends and my dance group. We were leaving from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to\
  \ Teresina, Piau\xED - Brazil. I was definitely excited, but at the same time nervous,\
  \ cause it would be my first time on a  volunteer trip, just with my friends. Although,\
  \ I was with my heart opened, ready to share the things I've learned during my seventeen\
  \ years and also ready to share love and compassion.\nThe plan was having a 20 days\
  \ tour through a few cities- Caridade, Cabaceira, Sim\xF5es e Maria Preta. The objective\
  \ of this trip was reunited a big group of people from all around Brazil to go to\
  \ the backwoods of Piaui to introduce them to a few art workshops and also share\
  \ our love. We discovered that they were really poor people that usually live in\
  \ the backwoods, big families in small houses. Lots of them are not even able to\
  \ read or to write. As it was said, it wouldn't be a comfortable trip for us travelers,\
  \ but a challenging one, we were going there to serve, to help and to be useful\
  \ through our skills. First days we went to Teresina and slept in the accommodation\
  \ of a team called Jocum. We spent 2  nights there. It was the two most comfortable\
  \ nights we had. In addition, in this accommodation, we met other travelers who\
  \ were passing by preparing for their next volunteer work.\n After having the whole\
  \ group together we took a bus to guide us to the first city, Sim\xF5es. It took\
  \ a whole 18 hours of the bus to get to the place. We arrived in that city and our\
  \ next lodging would be a school. Our time there was a week, a week full of activities.\
  \ Our group wakes up early around 7 am, we go together walking for about 20 minutes\
  \ to have breakfast and we had to be back until 8:30 am. Every day we offered free\
  \ courses for the entire population. It had ballet courses for babies, reading,\
  \ theater, hip-hop, crafts and among others. When we finished the course we only\
  \ had time for a quick dinner, in the same place that we had coffee and, then every\
  \ night we have a presentation in the town square. In the city, we were being advertised\
  \ as a circus or art team, and our goal was to offer a different show every night\
  \ for free to the population. The show had everything, humor show, dance,  theater\
  \ play and music. Every night the population waited for our show. In our last days,\
  \ we visited two Quilombola communities, 5 hours traveling to each one, The reality\
  \ in these communities was very different, their houses were very small, it was\
  \ really the backlands, many had no electricity, also not all went to school and\
  \ so many could not read. Poverty was even bigger. We went there to present our\
  \ show and to give them some donations we have collected.\nMy heart was grateful\
  \ for that trip, people were so happy with our simple show that our fatigue and\
  \ the desire to take more than one bath a day were forgotten. They did not want\
  \ us to leave, the children always asked if we would ever go there again. They feel\
  \ forgotten, and with our presence, they felt so important. Of all the events I\
  \ have two that marked me. One was when one of my friends was dancing ballet in\
  \ points and at the end of the presentation, a very old lady came hugging her so\
  \ happy and said that she thought she would die and would never see a girl dancing\
  \ on tiptoe. Secondly, a family decided to get together and cook for us,  a huge\
  \ dinner. They did not want us to do anything, we were served by them, and they\
  \ said that was the way they found to thank us for all the good we had brought to\
  \ them."
