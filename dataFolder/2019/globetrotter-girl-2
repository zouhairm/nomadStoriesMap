Text: "I love travel in India because\u2026I have learned to appreciate the simple\
  \ things in life.\n\nThis little boy with his rucksack slung over his shoulder,\
  \ is a great reminder.\n\nIt was my first trip to India, it got off to a rough start,\
  \ I was sick, run down, and new to India.\n\nThis brief encounter, his carefree\
  \ spirit, completely  changed my outlook that day and set the tone for many more\
  \ wonderful adventures to follow!\n\nI love travel in India because :\n\nIn a small\
  \ village, on the edge of nothing, I found myself on a rooftop with dozens of women\
  \ in their best saris, holding their babies, waiting in line to have me take their\
  \ photo for the first time.\n\nAnd months later, when I returned, we all sat on\
  \ that same rooftop, giggling over the photos I had brought them until it was dark\
  \ outside. Sisterhood.\n\nWhere else would I find even stones telling stories and\
  \ telling them since ages, creating a continuous civilization for us.\n\nI love\
  \ travel in India because it is a land of a billion smiles.\n\n I love travel in\
  \ India because. Only in India I get to see physical evidence that God is omnipresent\
  \ and in every form; be it a stone, a tree, a cow, a person possessed by spirits,\
  \ the small shrine in the middle of crossroads or even autorickshaw meter! \n\n\
  A mid-winter visit to a Buddhist-run school in Leh, Ladakh becomes a cultural exchange\
  \ and offering of kindness.\n\nI love travel in India because every visit is different,\
  \ every experience unique.\n\nTravelling as a family showed us the value of shared\
  \ experience.\n\nIndia taught us about each other, and about cultures vastly different\
  \ from our own.\n\n\nI love travel in India because each day you step outside is\
  \ an adventure. You can\u2019t guess what awaits you.\n\nBharat Mata ki jai. \n\n\
  But, at the same time, India has wide-open quiet spaces that many don\u2019t travel\
  \ to.\n\nYou can find your peace in nature. You can have it all in India!\n\nI love\
  \ to travel in india because here it\u2019s a celebration always. It\u2019s full\
  \ of colour and diversity.\n\nIt\u2019s like a mountain valley in spring when the\
  \ land explodes with life in myriads of hues and colours.\n\nThe beauty of India\
  \ lies in the spontaneous,  un-manicured experiences you get while travelling.\n\
  \nI love travel in India because there is simply nowhere like it \u2026 the people\
  \ and the culture and the food and the ancient history \u2026 I love how my friends\
  \ call me \u2018 Uncle \u2018  and I love the respect shown to elders .\n\nI love\
  \ Bollywood movies and the songs; I heard them so many times from a cheap radio\
  \ at every corner or shop or chai stall.\n\nI love the train network and the service\
  \ and the tiffin tins and the cries of the vendors \u2026 and I love how India is\
  \ called Mother.\n\nI love travel in India because there is no country which encapsulates\
  \ diversity so perfectly.\n\nAs the only non-local audience at a village, located\
  \ deep in the inland forests of Bekal in Kerala, I feel equally connected to a Theyyam\
  \ artist imbibing the role of Goddess Bhagvathi, as anyone else in the village.\n\
  \nWe are distanced by nothing. Not language, caste, creed or regionality.\n\nI love\
  \ travelling to India. \nBecause in her quiet and in her chaos\nI find a depth of\
  \ experience that is unparalleled,\n\nand while marveling at the ingenious joyful\
  \ response to life that is the essence of this mystical land and her people,\n\n\
  I love travelling in India because wherever I go, I can find a family and a home.\n\
  Because the simplicity and quietness of rural life is striking and unpretentious.\n\
  \nAnd in villages across India, I\u2019m in awe of expert yet humble artisans, soulfully\
  \ engaged in arts that have been passed down from generation to generation over\
  \ thousands of years.\n\nI love travel in India because anything can happen. A quick\
  \ lunch with friends in a Jaisalmer restaurant can be transformed into a two hour\
  \ session of watching black and white Bollywood movies with Jake, restaurant\u2019\
  s owner, and listening to the stories of his life while tears of lost memories rolled\
  \ down his cheeks."
