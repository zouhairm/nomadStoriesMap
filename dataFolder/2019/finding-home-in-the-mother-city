Text: "Since first arriving in this gem of a city, there is always a sense of the\
  \ exciting unknown. \nTo this day, whenever I return, that feeling of seeing Table\
  \ Mountain and Lion's Head as we are landing, feeling the Mzansi sun on my face\
  \ and the excitement of the senses lets me know that I am Home. \n\nCape Town provides\
  \ the benefits of a city, but you are never far from nature either. Nature reigns\
  \ supreme here! Hikes up Table Mountain at sunrise seem to connect me to another\
  \ world. Laying in the sun on the beautiful beaches, being a part of the sea life,\
  \ or just simply relaxing while I take Afternoon Tea at the historical Mount Nelson\
  \ Hotel.\n\nSouth Africa's Apartheid rule formally ended with negotiations between\
  \ 1990-1991. The precursor being the release of Nelson Mandela after 30 years of\
  \ political incarceration. This year marks the 25th Anniversary since the first\
  \ Free Elections on 27 April 1994.\nWhile many years have passed, it is still evident\
  \ that there is work to be done here. Both politically, and on a societal level.\
  \ South Africans are known as the Rainbow Nation, and with that, face many different\
  \ problems but, also an opportunity for many different solutions.\n\nThough South\
  \ Africa has a turbulent past, and a rather unknown future at present, there is\
  \ an energy here. A feeling that I do not find anywhere else, a sense of truly being\
  \ alive! I see it in the faces of the people on the streets, in the power of their\
  \ smiles and their determination to persevere.\nI feel it in the communities, and\
  \ in the stories of ancestors that are shared over a meal in their homes. It gives\
  \ me hope. Hope for a better South Africa, hope for a better tomorrow for us all!\n\
  \nThe vibrancy, the sounds, smells, tastes and soul of the Mother City, is one of\
  \ the most beautiful and special places I have been to on this planet. It is why,\
  \ when this nomad is homesick, I always long for Cape Town! \n\nI leave you these\
  \ words from Tata, which means Father in Xhosa. It is a term of endearment given\
  \ to Mandela by many South Africans..  \n\n\u201CAs we let our own light shine,\
  \ we subconsciously give other people permission to do the same\u201D \n\n- Nelson\
  \ Mandela (Madiba, Father of the Nation)"
