Text: "And there I was, sat on museum steps in Mexico\xB4s City looking at the rain\
  \ and getting shivers when the cold wind touched my skin. Wet hair, wet shoes, wet\
  \ clothes. \nBeing in a city 1.902,4 km far from home, alone, below a cloudy sky\
  \ without enough money (and enough hunger) doesn't sound like the best travel experience,\
  \ however, that precise moment was the best moment for me to notice all the different\
  \ experiences I went through in that two weeks trip, from getting lost on those\
  \ infinite streets surrounded by enormous buildings, to listen to more than three\
  \ different languages in one single room in Bellas Artes while I was appreciating\
  \ a Pablo Picasso's painting. I was smiling. A couple of minutes passed stick together\
  \ with my thoughts and reflections of the days before that moment, the rain didn't\
  \ cease so I ventured myself walking in the downpour until I arrived at a mall.\
  \ Finding the restroom and try to dry my socks while people looked at me with an\
  \ \"ah! tourist!\" expression on their faces became in another great story to tell\
  \ when I stayed in that beautiful city. \nThat trip was simply different because\
  \ it was the first time I found myself in Mexico\xB4s colors and flavors, I found\
  \ myself in my own country. It was like a revelation to me, I didn't expect to find\
  \ myself in that city's details, I found myself in those beautiful handicrafts,\
  \ in the cracks of the oldest houses, in the traditional dishes, in the incredible\
  \ historic architecture, in the delicious spicy of each meal that makes you cry\
  \ but you continue eating because of its taste, I found myself in the people, in\
  \ their happiness, generosity, and kindness. \nLooking back and think about the\
  \ streets and places I walked, makes me feel like a part of me stayed in them, and\
  \ a part of them stayed with me. It is an indescribable sensation. People say that\
  \ you can leave Mexico, but Mexico will never leave you. I can also say that no\
  \ matter if you are Mexican or not, once you connect with Mexico, it stays within\
  \ you forever."
