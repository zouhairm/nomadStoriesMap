Text: "Traveling is adventurous and it\u2019s supposed to be fun but no one talks\
  \ about traveling solo with a severe mental illness. \n\nI was just diagnosed with\
  \ a panic disorder and anxiety two weeks before my trip and I was given medication\
  \ in case I needed it. \n\nI was planning a five day trip to Anaheim, California.\
  \ It was my first solo-trip and I was excited to find myself in a new city but it\
  \ followed with an underlying fear of the unknown. \n\nWhat if you want to travel\
  \ but your anxiety, depression, or panic attacks stop you from enjoying those spontaneous\
  \ adventurous moments? Sometimes you have to just buy that ticket and go. Figure\
  \ every moment as it comes.\n\nAlthough there were moments I was on edge during\
  \ my trip, I still was able to enjoy all its moments. I was able to walk on several\
  \ beautiful California beaches, eat at some unique spots, and even make a special\
  \ friend who joined me in most of my adventures. \n\nMy favorite moments were walking\
  \ on the beach and looking out on top of a hill as the sun went down. I was surprised\
  \ as the weather in Anaheim is chilly in the evening, which is nothing like Texas\
  \ heat. Walking down streets of shops and restaurants near long beach as the sky\
  \ was a beautiful shade of blue and people were riding bikes and walking in bathing\
  \ suits, so laid-back and care-free. I finally could see why people love California.\n\
  \nThe diverse plates of food I ate where unbelievable. Delicious pho soup, sushi\
  \ in the shape of animals, Korean soup, and tacos. I swear I would move to California\
  \ just for its food.\n\nAlthough not a Cali native I did gain a travel buddy who\
  \ came from Miami, she helped me realize when to let go and enjoy every moment in\
  \ my trip. I left California with a happy heart and a feeling of sadness as I left.\
  \ Also, the medication I was given in case I suffered from panic attacks were never\
  \ used during my trip.\n\nTwo years later, I no longer have a panic disorder. Instead\
  \ I have a hunger for travel and the unknown."
