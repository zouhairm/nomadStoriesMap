Text: 'This story is not about visit other country is story about my travel in life
  to go throw this all obstacles to broke in piece and to fix myself, i travelled
  to many places into my mind to imagine that amazing trip that will make me feel
  like those who make the dream true. My story is started when i am young and have
  a lot of dreams that never happened to think of my futur is blessing or a curse
  and how to make it better for leaving. Why i felt so lonely ? How can i have a lot
  of friends and know their journey in life ? How can i learn from them ? ...

  Many questions get inside my mind but i was too young to realise that i can make
  my own travel, this life is too short to know everything but i felt too long to
  understand that i can''t success without throw all what put me down and make a lot
  of knowledge because it is now my powerful sword to fight even protect myself from
  myself to make the beast inside me us a beauty always kind and smilling. Until know
  i am still thinking in my future if i can achieve my dreams and do all what i want
  to do and that''s makes me a fraid from everything i felt that my life doesn''t
  mean anything even i died now one will know me many people i knew that will forget
  me but i will never make it happen i will write my travel and make people know that
  i am not worthless i didn''t leave without a fight i did all my best and make some
  of my dreams become true not for anyone just for myself i will stay always live
  us gladiator but i hope that darkness will never rise inside me i believe in myself
  to be better, i believe that i can change my own life and make it full of love and
  peace this is my story is too short us my life but it''s too long to live like i
