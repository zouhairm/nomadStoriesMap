Text: "The cool whiff skimmed over my skin while I was undressing to my bathing costume.\
  \ Although it was Christmas time, the Primavera (Spring) forest was gleaming in\
  \ vernal hue. The odd orchestra of birds soothed the aura around us. The surface\
  \ of the hot rivulet was hazed by mist. I\u2019ve never been this far from my country,\
  \ still I wasn\u2019t lost because one of us was home in Mexico.\n\nI was among\
  \ the benighted people in the world regarding the North-American country until our\
  \ life entangled each other. My previous notions of Mexico flap away gradually by\
  \ the recitals from a local, my love. I was eager to gaze the horizon over the far-reaching\
  \ Pacific ocean yet ignoring what could had been awaiting for me in the mainland\
  \ of Mexico.\n\n\u2018Jalisco es Mexico\u2019 (Jalisco is Mexico) the signs displaying\
  \ proudly all around the state. Doubtlessly, the Mexican culture is deeply rooted\
  \ here through the born of Tequila and the renowned Mariachi music. Wilderness enshrouds\
  \ the entire region, also where the Rio Caliente (Hot River) meanders after escaping\
  \ from the trap of the volcanic magma.\n\nFor a moment, the hot volcanic water was\
  \ burning my flesh as I stepped in. It took a minute for my body to adjacent entirely\
  \ to the temperature of the river. Despite of our silence, the persistent noise\
  \ of the vigorous cascade was keeping the quiescence away. The stoney barricades\
  \ blocking the way of the river was not only responsible for the presence of these\
  \ short waterfalls but for the creation of baths where we could stretch out in the\
  \ trapped water.\n\nIn recent days it was a gift to savor the atmosphere of a wondrous\
  \ place like this without being over packed with tourists. After a while, our bodies\
  \ became overwhelmed with the warm and started craving after the reviving cool air.\
  \ Hence we headed off in the river, side by side, wading through the rivulet, while\
  \ the December breeze was cooling our skins.  During our wandering we had to realize,\
  \ we are not alone. Silence was still present when the little ashen squirrels ventured\
  \ on approaching us from the dense flora. Lucky us it wasn\u2019t one of the also\
  \ local inhabitants, the lynxes.\nDespite of the metropolis lying at the edge of\
  \ the Bosque de la Primavera it is still passably untouched. Apparently this intensifies\
  \ its particularity along with the R\xEDo Caliente and the diverse flora and fauna.\
  \ Even local citizens are not aware of what treasure they have within their reach\
  \ and still less cognizant of that the forest is about to be devastated in favor\
  \ of multinational companies. The fact that we just spent a morning in the wild\
  \ sounds conventional, although it was a place which is not on the cover of travel\
  \ brochures, not among the top results in search engines about Mexico, and after\
  \ all that\u2019s what makes it invaluable, perfect."
