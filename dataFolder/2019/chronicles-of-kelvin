Text: "I remember vividly the shapes and shades I came across during my time away\
  \ in South Africa. My journey to the South was quite adventurous and interesting\
  \ .In the heat of summer, I set off on a vacation to SA the world I have never known\
  \ and been before. The only basic information I learned  of this land in the Southern\
  \ region was that, it was a commercial hub, heavily industrialized, scenic and to\
  \ some extent infested with crime.\n\nI had seen pictures before and watched on\
  \ a television cassette some bitter-sweet reports about this land. with all that\
  \ however, I yearned and looked forward to have a first-hand experience during my\
  \ break away. So, to make it more live and adventurous I decided to do the cross\
  \ country by road. From Lusaka, Zambia I took off. \n\nIt was Sunday morning and\
  \ hoped to  arrive the following day on a Monday. I was casually dressed up and\
  \ my feet were shod in a pair of slacks I bought the other day. I felt comfortable\
  \ and fulfilled. I bought myself a seat that lay close to the window where I could\
  \ clearly sight-see. When i checked on my wrist watch, the time read 06:00 a.m when\
  \ the driver started the engine. I imagined what lay ahead of me. When I checked\
  \ on the map, our route was via Zimbabwe to Beit Bridge leading into South Africa.\n\
  \nThe weather was fair and becoming, good for travel and seated next to me was a\
  \ lady in her mid-forties and wore a friendly face. We exchanged smiles and glances.\
  \ From the beginning I knew I had good company at least. As soon as the bus came\
  \ out of the City of Lusaka the driver started to increase on the speed. Some pockets\
  \ of noise sprang up. People conversing, a baby crying, some whispers and the sound\
  \ of the engine as well as some distant singing of birds.\nSuddenly, I was alone\
  \ with my thoughts. My mind went back to the day i was in high school. I thought\
  \ about Beck and Naluchi those two babies were really lookers. On second thought\
  \ I decided that It would be great meeting them again now that I was a grown-up.\
  \ I looked at myself admiringly and approved with a nod of satisfaction that i was\
  \ looking well-built up and handsome. I told myself no blonde in her right head\
  \  would dare refuse such a gent.\nI was brought to the surface with a start! The\
  \ bus heaved forward and immediately pulled up along the  kerb. There was in a sudden\
  \ panick..."
