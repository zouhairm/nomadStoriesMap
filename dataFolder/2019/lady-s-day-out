Text: "\u201CCentral line. Jubilee line. District line...\u201D confused trying to\
  \ figure out the knots of lines, I take a deep breath. Sitting at Wimbledon station\
  \ I start thinking. The city from where I belong has ONE metro line. I\u2019m from\
  \ India, more accurately I\u2019m from Kolkata. I\u2019ve come to visit England\
  \ with my family because I\u2019m nineteen and still not allowed to travel alone.\
  \ \nYet I\u2019m sitting here at Wimbledon station alone, trying to unknot the London\
  \ Underground. I\u2019ve to reach a station named \u2018Earl\u2019s court\u2019\
  \ by 10 a.m. and it\u2019s already 9.45. I\u2019ve no idea how far it is and I\u2019\
  ve got this permission to spend a day alone in the city of London after much hustle\
  \ with my parents and I can\u2019t let this day go to waste. \nI approach a passerby,\
  \ an elderly gentleman. With his difficult British accent he tells me to follow\
  \ the District line and finally I get in the metro. Focused on the announcements,\
  \ I hear \u201CThe next station is Earl\u2019s Court\u201D. I get down and there\
  \ he is! \nWe met back in Kolkata at a house party through common friends and instantly\
  \ clicked. He was volunteering with an organisation and I was pursuing my graduation.\
  \ We dated for the rest of the time that he was in India and he left with a promise\
  \ to come back again any time he gets a chance. I thought we wouldn\u2019t meet\
  \ again. But we never know what plans God has. My parents planned a vacation in\
  \ London and here I\u2019m meeting him after six months. I see him and all my confusions\
  \ vanish. I\u2019ve a big day ahead and I can\u2019t stop blushing.\nI\u2019m welcomed\
  \ with a tight hug and a long kiss. I can hear the violins play in the background\
  \ like those Bollywood movies. The excitement lasted quite long and then he told\
  \ me the itinerary for the day. We are going to the Royal Botanical Garden. Now,\
  \ my idea of gardens has never been very exciting. Especially being from India,\
  \ that\u2019s not how we like spending a good day. But he is the guide for today\
  \ and I have to follow. So we take another metro in the same line and reach Victoria\
  \ Gate station. A little walk from the station and there it is, the entrance to\
  \ the garden. He gets the tickets done, we enter and I stand amazed for exactly\
  \ two minutes. I\u2019ve never ever seen such lush greens in the middle of a city.\
  \ We found ourselves a nook under the canopies by the 50 metre tall Great Pagoda\
  \ which we could see peeping through the sky right from the entrance. He has brought\
  \ a blanket that he spread on the grass. He took out the champagne bottle and the\
  \ orange juice and some freshly baked English pastries. To be honest, I didn\u2019\
  t know what a mimosa is before today.\nAfter our little brunch we decided on taking\
  \ a stroll around the garden.  Walking through the 18 metres high Treetop walk with\
  \ breathtaking view of the garden and the magnificent Japanese landscape garden\
  \ we reach the Palm House. The iconic Victorian Glasshouse with a rain forest climate\
  \ inside is the home to a wide range of tropical plants. After spending some time\
  \ looking at the greens when we came out it was already 4 in the afternoon. We decided\
  \ to go for a walk by the Thames and see the sunset. Down the same Underground line\
  \ we reach Embankment station. Walking out of the station I can see the Thames right\
  \ in front of my eyes. The walk ways by its banks are never not busy.\n Surrounded\
  \ by cosy pubs with outside seating areas it's very difficult to choose one. But\
  \ we found one with umbrellas and decided to quench our thirst with a glass of Guinness.\
  \ The sun has started playing hide and seek in the clouds and it\u2019ll be dark\
  \ soon. It\u2019s time for me to get back to my hotel. He comes to see me off. We\
  \ depart with a kiss and a promise to meet again. May be we will, maybe we won\u2019\
  t. But what\u2019s important is that today\u2019s memory will forever be cherished."
