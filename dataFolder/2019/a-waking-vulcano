Text: "Approaching the top of this bizarre landscape I wondered if I was still on\
  \ Earth or on the moon. A year before, my granddad had passed away, and as he loved\
  \ volcanoes, I had decided to climb one in honor of him. Twilight commenced and\
  \ as the slope became steeper and my legs heavier, more artificial lights and antennas\
  \ appeared. After hiking for a day, I reached the highest point of Panama: the top\
  \ of the sleeping Volc\xE1n Bar\xFA. Between some electricity poles and tents, I\
  \ searched for a place to hang my hammock, but the wind was strong and ice cold.\
  \ Next to what looked like a massive electricity generator was a little concrete\
  \ hut with light coming through its window. Hoping to find some advice, I passed\
  \ through the gate and knocked on the door. First carefully, then firmly.\n\nAfter\
  \ some time, a tall, middle-aged man in white striped pajamas opened the door, looking\
  \ as if he was on his way to bed \u2013 or had just come out. He seemed surprised\
  \ to find a lonely adventurer at his door at this time. \u2018Buena sera\u2019,\
  \ I tried in my baby Spanish. \u2018I\u2019m here with my hammock and was wondering\
  \ if you\u2019d know where I could hang it.\u2019 After a multilingual word mess\
  \ explanation, he indicated towards where the wind had just felt strongest \u2013\
  \ and believe me, the wind was cold here at 3,475 meters high. \u2018Okay\u2019\
  , he said, sensing my confusion, and gestured that I could stay in his \u2018place\u2019\
  . \_Did I trust this man? Would he do something and get away with it? This place\
  \ seemed one of a kind and owned by the government. At first I was hesitant, but\
  \ for some reason it felt he was a good man, and down in the village people knew\
  \ I was here. \u2018Okay\u2019, I thought, and took the risk.\nWith its cement walls,\
  \ iron door with a porthole and lack of anything impractical, this small place reminded\
  \ me of a ship, except that it was equipped with a massive electricity installation\
  \ bigger than the hut itself. Paco was a calm, sympathetic man from the village\
  \ at the foot of the vulcano. He stayed here half of the time, serving electricity\
  \ generation for the radio and TV reception for the country. Every 3 weeks, he changed\
  \ shifts with his colleague. \u2018Where were you staying before?\u2019 he asked\
  \ me. I hesitated to answer, but after I did, of course he turned out to know Antonio,\
  \ the owner of that hostel. \u2018What are you doing here alone? Do you have a boyfriend?\
  \ Why doesn\u2019t he come with you? Women should not be alone,\u2019 he said concerned,\
  \ and warmed me a can of beans on his simple but stable stove. I ate them appreciatively\
  \ with the dry crackers that made it to the end of the day, and after this hike,\
  \ they tasted wonderful. Paco put a mattress on the floor and opened my sleeping\
  \ bag. \u2018Buenas noches oruga\u2019; \u2018Good night caterpillar\u2019, he said,\
  \ and went to bed. Contently and excited about the passed and coming adventure,\
  \ I fell asleep.\n\nA few hours later, I woke up from sunrays shining through the\
  \ porthole. Would I be in time to see the sunrise? I rushed into my clothes, packed\
  \ my bag as quietly as possible, and grabbed the door handle. But at that moment,\
  \ Paco woke up. \u2018Will you do something for me?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Please\
  \ say hi to Antonio.\u2019 For this kind man, of course I would. I stepped outside\
  \ and continued my journey to the top. More hikers arrived after their night-hike\
  \ from the village, including my friends from the hostel. \u2018What a hike\u2026\
  \u2019 they admitted exhausted. \u2018You made a good decision staying here\u2019\
  \ \u2013 something everyone had discouraged me to do \u2013 and we searched for\
  \ a spot to enjoy the sunrise. As far as we could see, clouds separated us from\
  \ the rest of the world, and we became one. \n\nA golden line rose above the clouds\
  \ and soon, a ros\xE9 golden ball casted everything into a wonderful warm glow.\
  \ As a sailor, I had seen beautiful sunrises, but this was definitely the most phenomenal.\
  \ This was like waking up in life."
