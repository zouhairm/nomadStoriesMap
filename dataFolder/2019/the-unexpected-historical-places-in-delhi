Text: "Delhi is a capital of India and I haven\u2019t got chance to visit the city\
  \ in last 25 Years. So this year I got a chance to explore it. It is a long way\
  \ from Mumbai but it was also my luck that I got here. I have not made any plan\
  \ so it was like backpack trip just for a sake of going out from boring day to day\
  \ life. \n\nWhen I landed in Delhi whole place was unknown to me and also I have\
  \ not even googled the places which I need to visit. You can say I was unknown about\
  \ what\u2019s going to happen. I was travelling to unknown ~ Delhi with a goal of\
  \ exploring the historic, archaeological destinations.  \n\nIndia is having rich\
  \ history and Delhi is well connected with the all historical and archaeological\
  \ factors. Starting with Chandni Chawk the well connecting history from Murals to\
  \ British all are well connected. I visited historic destinations like Red Fort,\
  \ Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib ji, Jama Masjid. \n\nNow that we have been to some historical\
  \ places in Delhi. Now the plan was to visit some more places. I have visited Gurudwara\
  \ Bangla Sahib it\u2019s a historic place linked to Sikh\u2019s eight guru. Near\
  \ this place there were two more ancient and architectural astronomy place. I have\
  \ never seen place like this. I was also not knowing that our ancestors were having\
  \ great knowledge about astronomy. The place consists of 13 architectural astronomy\
  \ instruments. Also there are some main instruments one shows time, one shows zenith\
  \ distance and the altitude of the sun, other is to determine the shortest and longest\
  \ days of the year. Other place I have visited is the place name Agrasen ki Baoli\
  \ its 60-meter long and 15-meter wide historical step well. It\u2019s not so famous\
  \ destination for Indians. But many foreign tourist visit this place. This place\
  \ was unknown to me I got the information about this place from local people.\n\n\
  Most important I was having 24 Hours to explore the city. There were last 3 hours\
  \ to explore some more place. So as per the duration and place suggested by many\
  \ person I visited Qutub Minar. It was one of the best place I visited. As per the\
  \ images on google my expectation was not too high. But when I visited the place\
  \ I was amazed with the Architectural works done. It\u2019s also UNESCO World Heritage\
  \ Site. The Calligraphy work done on all monuments are amazing. You will love the\
  \ finish work done by the people who made it. In today\u2019s time I think no one\
  \ can do the work done by them. I was very much amazed by it. Also I was not aware\
  \ about the place. Inside Qutub Minar Complex there are various things to see they\
  \ are Tomb of Iltutmish, Quwwatul Islam Masjid, Allaudin's Tomb and Madrasa, Azan\
  \ Tower, Sanderson\u2019s Sundia, Alai Minar.\n\nThis was the last destination I\
  \ have explored. It will always remain close to my heart. I would like to visit\
  \ this place every time I will go to Delhi. So trip ends with the happy note."
