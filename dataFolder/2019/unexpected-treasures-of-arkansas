Text: "Many 20 somethings have embarked on a cross country road trip seeking something.\
  \ In the fall of 2018 I found myself falling into that category. Putting the keys\
  \ into the ignition of my 2008 Subaru I embarked on my first trip out west. Searching\
  \ for my new purpose while discovery some hidden gems along the way was my plan.\
  \ I had a skeletal plan of what I wanted to do and the things I wanted to see, but\
  \ was going to leave a majority of it up to chance. After a quick jaunt in Mississippi,\
  \ I  set off to enter Arkansas. A state that held no curiosity or mystery in my\
  \ life, Arkansas. I knew virtually nothing about this place, only that I needed\
  \ to drive through it in order to get to Oklahoma. I had not anticipated that this\
  \ place was a state full of unassuming beauty and the most welcoming of individuals.\
  \ \n\nAs I crossed the border into Arkansas I decided to get over my preconceived\
  \ notions about the state and give it a shot. Instead of going straight to the campsite\
  \ I was going to call home for the evening, I opted to explore with an open mind.\
  \ When seeing an intriguing sign I would drive towards it as opposed to trying to\
  \ get through quickly. The first diversion started off towards the town of Hope\
  \ to see former President Bill Clinton\u2019s childhood home. The NPS sign acted\
  \ as a beacon calling out for me to get another stamp on my NPS passport. As I pulled\
  \ off the highway towards his home and the rain started to come down at what seemed\
  \ to be 100 miles a minute I was not deterred. Finally parking in front of the tiny\
  \ home that saw our president grow in his formative years, I was excited to have\
  \ this place to myself and to absorb all of the information I could. As I looked\
  \ around the exhibit, a timid park ranger offered to show me around the home. Excited\
  \ to step in the halls that Clinton once played in, the ranger and I shared an umbrella\
  \ and scurried towards the nearby home. There is something about exploring places\
  \ that hold such a rich history within their walls. \n\nSaying goodbye to Clinton\u2019\
  s home I wanted to remain on the National Park train so I headed towards Hot Springs,\
  \ a place where luxury and nature meet. The streets were lined with Victorian bath\
  \ houses acting as a time portal back to an era where you can imagine the many people\
  \ who visited nearly 100 years ago. Leaving Hot Springs National Park I headed towards\
  \ Lake Dardanelle State Park which I decided to call home for the night. I pulled\
  \ up to my campsite I quickly realized I was; A. the youngest person there and B.\
  \ one of the only people without an RV rig. As I set up my tent a woman around the\
  \ age of 70 walked up to me saying how inspiring it was that I was camping and traveling\
  \ solo. She said it was something she hoped to be brave enough to do someday. Her\
  \ words resonated with me- a woman who has lived a full life jealous of someone\
  \ whose life is virtually just beginning. She is only the first instance of kindness\
  \ I experienced in the Dardanelle.  After a night of sleeping in the rain I was\
  \ greeted by another retiree couple exploring Arkansas by way of their RV and accompanied\
  \ by their dogs. They invited me in for a cup of coffee and a much needed chat.\
  \ They shared stories of their grandchildren and I of my future plans and adventures.\
  \ Though our interactions were minuscule their impacts have lasted for the long\
  \ haul. That is the beauty of travel. You meet people who you would least expect\
  \ to leave an impact on you and at the most unexpected of times. Arkansas was a\
  \ place that I had no intentions of giving a fair chance. I planned to leave as\
  \ soon as I drove in, I learned, however, there is good in any place, you just have\
  \ to be willing to open your eyes to it."
