Text: "Life was good. I walked out of my very last university exam to find a job offer\
  \ sitting in my inbox. It was a temporary position based in Molfetta, Puglia - the\
  \ region spanning the heel of Italy. I pictured myself sunbathing on a strip of\
  \ sandy beach, with a book in one hand, and a cocktail in the other. I pictured\
  \ myself stuffing my face with pizza and pasta, as well as the (not-so-)occasional\
  \ gelato. I pictured myself having my morning coffee in one of those rustic caf\xE9\
  s, followed by a stroll along the seaside on a lazy Sunday afternoon... Life couldn\u2019\
  t get any better than this, could it?\n\nBefore I knew it, I had landed in Italy\
  \ and was on my way from Bari Airport to Molfetta. \"So this is it, this will be\
  \ a journey of a lifetime!\", I thought as I gazed out of the car window. Molfetta\
  \ has the typical look of an Italian town - faded yellow buildings with green window\
  \ shutters, colourful laundry dangling from the clotheslines, and cobblestone alleyways\
  \ weaving in and out of the historical centre. There were countless cats and dogs\
  \ lazing about in the sun, and I could hear Italian TV and radio programmes as I\
  \ walked on the streets. I found groups of people chit-chatting in every corner,\
  \ from the tobacconist\u2019s to the public fountains - they seemed to know everyone\
  \ else in the area. I couldn\u2019t wait to further explore this exotic town along\
  \ the Adriatic coast, and to see if it lived up to its reputation. Little did I\
  \ know, Southern Italy was not all glamorous.\n\nHaving lived in Hong Kong and London,\
  \ moving to a small town was definitely a challenge. I was used to being surrounded\
  \ by skyscrapers, the anonymity within the city, and being able to move around without\
  \ a car. The constant power cuts I experienced (whenever the electric heater and\
  \ kettle were on simultaneously) were the first warning signs that some first-world\
  \ problems would emerge. One thing that struck me most was the siesta right in the\
  \ middle of the day. I was out on the main street at 1pm and the town was, quite\
  \ frankly, dead. Everything was shut, people were nowhere to be seen, and I was\
  \ the only one wandering aimlessly. I waited, waited and waited\u2026 people finally\
  \ started flooding back in at about 5pm. My confusion multiplied when I noticed\
  \ that they generally had dinner after 9pm but had work at 8am the following day.\
  \ To someone who was accustomed to working from nine to six with an hour\u2019s\
  \ lunch break (without taking naps) and having dinner at 8pm at the latest, the\
  \ Southern Italian lifestyle was baffling, to say the least. Coupled with hints\
  \ of homesickness and loneliness, I felt out of place. To make matters worse, the\
  \ weather was horrendous as the rain never stopped pouring. I thought it was supposed\
  \ to be sunny all day, every day\u2026 I couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Southern Italy\
  \ was everything but what I imagined it to be. I did not love it. I did not even\
  \ like it.\n\nHowever, there are two sides to every coin. The food was as amazing\
  \ as promised. I couldn\u2019t stop dreaming about the orecchiette con le cime di\
  \ rapa (pasta with turnip greens, a Pugliese specialty) after I tried it for the\
  \ first time. The seafood was heavenly: octopus, mussels, shrimps\u2026 you name\
  \ it. Not to mention the pizzas and the fresh cheese, with burrata on the top of\
  \ my list. Moreover, Southern Italians are the friendliest people I have met to\
  \ date. They would offer me lifts before I even asked and make sure that I felt\
  \ at home in a country I could barely call home. Suddenly, Southern Italy did not\
  \ seem so bad anymore. The unknowns had given me an initial hiccup, but I gradually\
  \ started to appreciate and embrace the differences and characteristics of Southern\
  \ Italy. It is currently 2:30pm on a Monday afternoon, and as I am about to take\
  \ my midday nap before heading back to work at 5pm, I just want to say\u2026\n\n\
  La vita \xE8 ancora bella. (Life is still good.)"
