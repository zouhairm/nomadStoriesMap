Text: "In 2011 I moved from my home country of Portugal to go and live in England\
  \ once I arrived at the airport I didn\u2019t know a word of English I only knew\
  \ my birth language my mom was their waiting for me and my sister and my dad at\
  \ the airport with her friend and my younger brothers and sister that were born\
  \ in England. We got into the car and drove off to Grantham Lincolnshire once their\
  \ me and my sister waited two hole months to start school once we got to st Hugh\u2019\
  s school everything was good until I started to get bullied for being an immigrant\
  \ I only lasted their for three weeks has I kept getting bullied and excluded for\
  \ no reason then I moved to the priory ruskin academy where I got excluded and detention\
  \ every day I studied their until 2013. Everything seemed to be fine in my life\
  \ but not I was beaten up every time at my home by my dad and my mom trying to kill\
  \ me by trying to throw me out of the window I ran away from home every single day\
  \ has I couldn\u2019t cope any more with the abuse that i was suffering from my\
  \ parents I couldn\u2019t tell anyone because I was afraid of what could happen\
  \ to me until the day in 2013 I decided to tell my youth worker what was happening\
  \ she asked me if I wanted my dad and mom charged and I said yes in that same day\
  \ she called my social worker and my social worker got in contact with the police.\
  \ I went back home and told my dad that he was going to be arrested that same day\
  \ he pinned me into a wall and put his hand around my throat in an attempt to kill\
  \ me that\u2019s when the police knocked on the house door and for a minute I thought\
  \ I was going to die and I would have died if the police didn\u2019t knock on the\
  \ door when they did. My dad was arrested and so was my mom me and my siblings where\
  \ transported to the police station where I was in the same day taken to hospital\
  \ to check my injury\u2019s then we got split up into different short term foster\
  \ parents. The next day I was due to go to school but I was taken into the police\
  \ station to give evidence against my dad and mom and have my pictures taken off\
  \ my injury\u2019s for the case. Then me and my sister got taken into a foster home\
  \ while the court case was going to start the next day we started at new schools\
  \ then I miss behaved at the foster home where got moved to another one where i\
  \ actually enjoyed the people. The court case finished and it was decided me and\
  \ my two sisters were to stay in permanent foster care until we were 18 and my two\
  \ younger brothers were to go up for adoption. I miss behaved at Skegness academy\
  \ every single day and got moved into a naughty school and I actually liked this\
  \ one I felt free to express who I was got to ride motorbikes then in 2017 my two\
  \ brothers were adopted and I had my last contact with them. I finally finished\
  \ my school at the naughty school and went into Lincoln college to study sports\
  \ coaching then I moved home because my other foster parents were going to retire\
  \ so I moved to a different foster family in Lincoln and I liked it I started helping\
  \ in their farm with the cows and everything and whilst studying at Lincoln college\
  \ I finished my course and decided to do another year at college in the same subject\
  \ but for level one sports coaching that started in 2017 and was going to finish\
  \ in 2018 I finished the course whilst doing everything has normal and then I decided\
  \ once I finished to go and get a job and save up to move back to Portugal and that\u2019\
  s what I did I moved back on the 27 of August and still in Portugal"
