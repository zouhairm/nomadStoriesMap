Text: "Last year, for my birthday, I decided to go to Vancouver, Canada. It was the\
  \ first time I would travel without my family and the bare thought of it got me\
  \ excited. I made my research and found that there is a rainforest in Victoria and\
  \ since it wasn\xB4t that far, I took the ferry right after I landed in Vancouver.\n\
  \nThe next day I got up early, rented a car and hit the road. After and hour or\
  \ so of driving I saw the tiny parking lot indicating the entrance to the beach.\
  \ I really was like nothing I\xB4ve ever seen, all the rocks, the breeze, the cold\
  \ weather, it was fantastic.\n\nI kept walking for about 2 hours and decided to\
  \ head back to the car, so I could visit the East-Sooke Regional Park. Getting there\
  \ was a little tricky, even though I was using the GPS on my phone, I got lost a\
  \ couple of times but at the end it was totally worth it.\n\nAs I pulled out of\
  \ the car I was greeted by this large meadow with trees on the background. I approached\
  \ to one of those information maps  and picked the route I would walk, I knew I\
  \ had about 3 hours to walk around so I could  return the car and still make the\
  \ ferry back to Vancouver. How wrong I was.\n\nI started walking, taking the \"\
  Beach Trail\" first, I could see the sea to my left and the forest to my right.\
  \ I would, occasionally, run into couples or families going the other way. I was\
  \ perplexed by the beauty of it all, I couldn\xB4t put my camera away, some times\
  \ I try to fight it, though; photography has taught me to admire and enjoy with\
  \ my eyes before snapping pictures like crazy. To treasure those moments. \n\nAn\
  \ hour had gone by and I changed trails, headed deep into the forest, I was sure\
  \ I could make it back since I had seen that map. That\xB4s where the real adventure\
  \ began. The day started to fade, not only making way for the low temperatures but\
  \ also for the animals. I walked for hours, at this time I had already put the camera\
  \ away and I was just taking it all in, I couldn\xB4t believe the peacefulness,\
  \ the sounds, branches breaking, the wind caressing the trees. I was enjoying the\
  \ experience but I realized I was lost. The little voice in my head started to panic\
  \ about it but my foolish side, influenced by some unjustified-confidence and some\
  \ kind of excitement found between the anxiety and the fear of getting lost, kept\
  \ me going. \n\nSomewhere along the trail I found a fork, I revisited the map, or\
  \ what it was left of it, in my mind and remembered that I had to go right. The\
  \ light was slipping and the trees didn\xB4t help much, 2 or 3 more hours had passed,\
  \ I don\xB4t remember, but the real struggle came when the path was no longer noticeable,\
  \ not because of the light but because of the nature claiming the trail, so, using\
  \ what I had left of that confidence and, what I now believe was, adrenaline, followed\
  \ by some pretty lucky choices, I got back, I saw the same meadow from before and\
  \ I was ecstatic! \n\nWalking to the car, suddenly,  I felt it flooding me, some\
  \ feeling of pride for what I\xB4d achieved, it felt like a victory. I got in the\
  \ car and bursted with laughter for what had happened the past few hours. I was\
  \ happy, I smiled all the way back to Victoria.\n\nAt the end I made up for the\
  \ time I\xB4d lost and arrived at the last ferry of the day.\n\nThat single day\
  \ made the entire trip worth it and I would do it again, because getting lost was\
  \ an amazing experience."
