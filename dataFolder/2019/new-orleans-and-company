Text: "New Orleans was the city of choice. I was enjoying my mom as company opposed\
  \ to no company at all. For a week we hit up the pre-mandated tourist attractions.\
  \ I held a baby crocodile with it's mouth tied shut on a boat ride out to the bayou\
  \ at the exact moment it decided to pee on my shoes. We toured on the air-conditioned\
  \ safety of the double-decker bus that was populated by families with small children\
  \ and elderly with white tennis shoes and high socks. We split most drinks and took\
  \ candid shots with vibrant background colours and powdered faces from the beignet\u2019\
  s at Cafe au Lait. On day four we ate oysters and alligator bites and labeled ourselves\
  \ locals. So much deep-fried food. We missed Mardi Gras but the beads were still\
  \ there. I think they're present all year; at least as long as it takes for moss\
  \ to grow all over. It makes the town look constantly festive, as does the 24/7\
  \ party ongoing across seven blocks of music and laughter. I had yet to experience\
  \ live jazz before, and a truly wonderful thing to be introduced to the genre in\
  \ the very city it was born. \nBy now, I was a week into sharing and caring and\
  \ basic politeness we learn in Kindergarten, so I decided to send my mom back to\
  \ our accommodation on the trolley while I saved the remaining half day for myself.\
  \ While we were still drinking Hurricane\u2019s at Pat O\u2019Brians I used Tinder\
  \ for the greater good. I claimed to be new to town and needed a tour guide which\
  \ he so kindly offered to do so. I was after the behind-the-scenes version of New\
  \ Orleans you can only know by asking.\nI chugged what was left of my drink and\
  \ canned it before he could label me a mess and walk on by me, head down, dodging\
  \ a bullet. Sure enough, there on a timely manner at the busy corner downtown, we\
  \ met. \nHis name was Nick and I tasked him with finding me a coffeeshop that would\
  \ put bourbon in my iced coffee. I figured it was a must; to drink bourbon on bourbon\
  \ street. \nHe came through! We further walked on and dodged drinks spilled from\
  \ balconies. He told me stories of growing up there and I too was convinced I\u2019\
  d grown up there until we split ways (he spared me his lunch break) and we arranged\
  \ to meet that weekend. Too bad I\u2019d be back in Canada by then. I got my bourbon,\
  \ banter and some good company, and I hope he did too! \nI waved to everyone waving\
  \ to me, and meandered over to follow the Trolley line home via sidewalk, to see\
  \ what I\u2019d been trolley-ing by on foot. \nIt was as rough as it looked from\
  \ the trolley and I knew I should be nervous but I couldn\u2019t help it. I\u2019\
  m not a fan of shoes so I took them off and shoved them in my purse. The further\
  \ I got, the more it appeared to be populated by those who had been kicked off Boubon\
  \ Street for what could potentially be public intoxication. The holding cells were\
  \ probably full. I smiled and waved anyway as a naive, privileged, 20-something-millennial\
  \ dressed in a tube top and skirt to prevent tan lines. Power walking, I was picking\
  \ up bits and pieces of conversation from those living on the sidewalks watching\
  \ life pass them. \nOne mans soft spoken voice spoke directly to me, probably because\
  \ it was directed at me.\n\u201CPut on your shoes girly. Your feet\u2019ll be cut.\u201D\
  \ \nHis voice was neutral. It wasn\u2019t patronizing, defiant, all-knowing, or\
  \ superior. \nI could tell he knew things, but i\u2019ll never know because I walked\
  \ on by like I was the local and he was the tourist. \nHe could\u2019ve begged for\
  \ change. Instead, he cared.\nI left New Orleans feeling like it was the kindest\
  \ place in the world, where people truly care for you and I sincerely hope everyone\
  \ gets a chance to walk the trolley line past this genuine man.\nNew Orleans."
