Text: "The rear lights before us didn\u2019t move. They remained fixed in relative\
  \ space, prisoners of the same infinite tunnel. Interstate-10, at night, on the\
  \ way to Las Cruces, New Mexico.\n\t\u201CCan you change the playlist? I use this\
  \ one to fall asleep.\"\nI scanned Julia\u2019s phone for something less sleep inducing\
  \ and settled on a playlist consisting of feel-good tunes from the last decade.\
  \ A few hundred miles earlier, the songs were a nostalgic mood boost. Now, we sat\
  \ in a grotesque reverie as the bass and auto-tuned voices pounded around us. The\
  \ black seemed to bend in from the edges of the highway, and every few miles reflected\
  \ signs reading, \u201CDUST STORMS MAY EXIST, ZERO VISIBILITY POSSIBLE\u201D would\
  \ hurtle through space past our windows. \n\tWe were on a transportation mission.\
  \ Post college graduation, Julia needed to move her car from our four-year home\
  \ in California to her hometown in Texas. I tagged along for the ride.\n\tA light\
  \ in the distance broke through the monotony.\n\t\u201CIs that the city up there?\u201D\
  \n\t\u201CNo, we\u2019re too far away. Is it a fire? Is that a flame?\u201D An entire\
  \ hillside glowed orange in the darkness in front of us. A patch of bright light\
  \ sat atop the hill. \n\t\u201CThat\u2019s the moon!\u201D \nThe top of the orb\
  \ was now visible, levitating slowly. I was witnessing a moonrise in the desert\
  \ for the first time. It seemed huge, out here its own planet, not a subsidiary\
  \ of this one. After hours of only darkness, I fixated on the orange light pulsing\
  \ down the hillside. We chased it along the straight line of the interstate.\n\t\
  The moon was of appropriate size again, safely above us, when we pulled off the\
  \ highway just beyond Las Cruces. We crawled down a side road leading into Bureau\
  \ of Land Management property \u2013  free camping, as far as we were concerned.\
  \ This stretch of BLM land below the Organ mountains was partitioned into public\
  \ and private swaths, and it seemed that much of it was utilized by NASA. Earlier,\
  \ we called to confirm there were no ballistic missile tests that day. From what\
  \ we could gather from the website, if there were, camping should be avoided, though\
  \ it was unclear whether anything on this stretch of desert was monitored or enforced.\
  \ \n\tWe were hoping to pull off the main road and set up camp, but we soon realized\
  \ it would be impossible. Past rains had carved grooves and holes into the baked\
  \ soil, creating miniatures of the valley in which we drove and the hills behind\
  \ us. The sedan wasn\u2019t going to make it far, but it was late, and we had no\
  \ backup plan. We managed to find a small driveway about five-hundred yards from\
  \ a dark compound of buildings. Our phone\u2019s flashlights scanned the ground\
  \ for a patch without too many rocks or bumps. As we began to set up, we noticed\
  \ a circular area of light soil, eight feet in diameter. A small hole in the middle\
  \ revealed ants coming and going from their terrestrial mansion. \n\tOut of options,\
  \ a safe distance from the ants, we pitched the tent and settled in to get the sleep\
  \ we\u2019d been staving off for the last few hours.  But we were closer to the\
  \ main road than we wanted. Every so often a car would pass, rattling as it made\
  \ its way over a cattle grid. Each time we were reminded that this is a strange\
  \ land. We didn\u2019t know the people in those cars.  We weren\u2019t given the\
  \ rules of this desert game. We were displaced, forced into guesswork and uncertainty.\n\
  \u201CI\u2019m scared.\u201D \n\u201CMe, too.\u201D\nWe slept in fits until the\
  \ sun rose a few hours later. Then we drove on."
