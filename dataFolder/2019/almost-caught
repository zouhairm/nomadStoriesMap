Text: "His hand had moved up my thigh, lightly grazing it and sending a sharp knife-like\
  \ lightning bolt across my stomach. For a moment, I swam in what was evidently desire\
  \ and let out a tiny moan. He hugged me. My mind was drifting, forgetting the distant\
  \ din of noise in the Medina at this time of the night. Noise I had become accustomed\
  \ to. I felt awakened. Aroused.\nNot wanting to appear less committed, I stroked\
  \ his blonde hair, still surprised by the stark difference in our skin color and\
  \ yet drawn to it, as though we were a backgammon board game. Yin and Yang. We had\
  \ let our guards down and given into our spur-of-the-moment desires. A mobile app\
  \ had turned two strangers into lovers. \nHis light bite to my neck brought me back.\
  \ I felt the hotness of the AC air, thick and cosy, a solid barricade from the wintry\
  \ air. I could hear the mueziin calling everyone to prayer and the usual pitter\
  \ patter of slippers as guests at the riad passed his room. Some heading out for\
  \ dinner to find couscous and yet others simply hoping to get surprised by the night.\
  \ Fes did that to anyone, it made you present and daring, turning docile human beings\
  \ into extroverted champs looking for the next conquer.\nHe was moving a bit too\
  \ fast now with less tact. He had quickly pulled my t-shirt over my head. There\
  \ was an urgency, a need to fulfill. Then, I sensed it rather than heard it, voices\
  \ conversing outside the door, in Arabic and French. I couldn\u2019t predict their\
  \ emotion. From my experience haggling with taxi drivers and Argan oil, Arabic sounds\
  \ like two people yelling.\nI tried to quietly extricate myself from his embrace.\
  \ There was a rap at the door, not a gentle rap expected from the caretaker but\
  \ an authoritative I-am-the-police-open-this-door rap. We couldn\u2019t have moved\
  \ any faster. He jumped up quickly finding and pulling his trousers whilst pulling\
  \ his sweater on at the same time. I put on my t-shirt, my heart pounding in my\
  \ ears. His face registered panic as he dressed. We knew this could easily be the\
  \ death of us.\nThe rapping momentarily stopped. There was excitement behind the\
  \ door. A lot of chattering in Arabic. Someone ran, his sandals making an uneven\
  \ pat! pat! pat! noise. Inside the room, I looked at him, urging him to open the\
  \ door but we stared at it unmoved. The feet were back and the voices were loud.\
  \ Someone was struggling with the lock, keys jingling. We had not budged, both of\
  \ us fully dressed and his hair unkempt and ruffled.\nThe door burst open. Everyone\
  \ looked at each other. \n\u201CWhat is going on?\u201D I asked.\nThey did not respond.\n\
  \u201CYeah, what\u2019s going on?\u201D he asked.\nSomeone was selling bells in\
  \ the Medina, ringing them every few seconds Krrrr! Krrr\nIn broken English, the\
  \ caretaker replied pointing at me, \u201Che is not be here, tell him to go to caf\xE9\
  .\u201D We looked at each other. \n\u201CWhy?\u201D he asked. \u201CHe is my friend\
  \ and we are working on a project together. We will stay here.\u201D\nThe caretaker\
  \ shifted uneasily then insisted, \u201Cno, no, no, he not be here, tell him go\
  \ now. Walahi...\u201D He switched to Arabic looking at his companions, hoping for\
  \ some direction. The companions wore Djellabahs \u2013 long, white robes, their\
  \ tarbushs swinging left to right as they talked animatedly. They stood by the door,\
  \ staring with shameless wonder at the room and its inhabitants.\n \u201CNO! I paid\
  \ for this room. We have done nothing wrong to be treated like this\u201D My lover\
  \ said while carefully slipping 50 dirhams into the caretaker\u2019s palm.\nThe\
  \ men had not seen the exchange, still too preoccupied with the room and the belongings\
  \ of the inhabitants.\nSuddenly, speaking in Arabic, the caretaker motioned for\
  \ them to leave. There was a murmur of dissent as they filed out, their faces showing\
  \ disappointment. \nMoment of silence.\n\u201CGay hookups in Morocco is an extreme\
  \ sport.\u201D He said laughing.\nI chuckled nervously."
