Text: "Don\xB4t cry, it\xB4s all going to be... They mentioned \"the\" clich\xE9 quote.\
  \ Ok, im gonna pick up my tears from the floor. I\xB4m mocking at you right now,\
  \ no hesitations. A few days after, a bunch of \"naive\" college girls, including\
  \ me, were on their way to a paradisiac surfing beach known as Sayulita, Nayarit\
  \ in M\xE9xico, to celebrate the a friend\xB4s birthday. The story is simple. we\
  \ got there, enjoyed the sunset and how the ambiance felt so clean almost as a metaphor\
  \ of precisely how we wanted to feel inside, we laughed to the lack of a german\
  \ bar tender jokes which made it more humorous, danced in all the local parties,\
  \ smiled because we knew that time was carrying us away and still we were there\
  \ together not caring at all. We cried, drank, a girl had sex, the rest of us focused\
  \ on drinking more, the nights were energetic and magnetic, the evenings were poetic,\
  \ we observed each sunset happening at the same spot everyday, right above the peek\
  \ of a hill next to the ocean. The sound of the waves mixing with the beats of the\
  \ parties and the majestic air that felt soft from a distance but itchy once it\
  \ got too close to our skin, as a self defense mechanism it had agaisnt us human\
  \ beings. we are too dramatic for nature. And then, one of those afternoons waiting\
  \ for the night to come it hit me. I was pretending the martyr for several years,\
  \ expecting everything from nothing, as a martyr does: Give everything to the world\
  \ and receive nothing in return because it would be a sin, too much for one single\
  \ person. I scratched my lips with sandy hands and accidentally tasted the bitter\
  \ flashback of my failed love relationship from months ago. The devil showed up\
  \ in the shape of a shadow that evening, sat next to me and reminded me that love\
  \ is not profitable and it will never stay, like the ocean, gets savage, wild and\
  \ dark, right at the most romantic phase of the cycle, total prank. I was accidentally\
  \ the devil\xB4s pilgrim, or a heretic believing every word he said, every single\
  \ time. That same day at a party, a stranger reached me, normally I would have declined\
  \ but this felt natural. We heard mutual confessions with all the attention alcohol\
  \ couldn\xB4t take away from us, and it felt as if the scene was planned by a celestial\
  \ energy, shape or god. We sat on the sand and talked about deep love, spiritual\
  \ life subjects. We actually were lacking of time, he wanted me to stay longer.\
  \ I remembered it was Holy week, and even though I\xB4m not a religious person,\
  \ this unexpected reunion in fact, felt holy. I will never forget the way that man\
  \ stared with bright eyes, listened, spoke and declared words out of his mouth naturally,\
  \ the way he talked calmly, purely as a saint,  the exact way a believer imagine\
  \ the biblical voices while praying for a brief moment of peace and salvation. Our\
  \ worlds collided for 5 hours and I recover the lost faith with a simple yet fulfilling\
  \ conversation while digging deep into my soul again. I can\xB4t precisely explain\
  \ how. All of a sudden the ocean looked so pure, life was beautifully heartbreaking,\
  \ and the tears I cried before I went to Sayulita became waves where I wanted to\
  \ swim in order to heal. I understood then that life is nothing and everything but\
  \ a journey and all the clich\xE9 quotes make some sense, and love? as the ocean,\
  \ it\xB4s always there, just sometimes from a distance. No, I don\xB4t know anything\
  \ from him nowadays, he was from Czech Republic. This trip showed me a self portrait\
  \ through nature and people, a reflection of the purest kind, an archive of vivid\
  \ three dimensional photographs that I needed to embrace. So I did, and went inside\
  \ the ocean with that stranger, to later say fairwell. That was my holy week, and\
  \ I went back to the city all wet in proudly tears, never again the same. I went\
  \ there to celebrate a party but ended up celebrating baptism."
