Text: "The lights flickered above as we peered up the dark hallway. Screams echoed\
  \ throughout the building. Hidden behind a doorway ahead, just out of sight, lurked\
  \ a waiting evil. I stared at my friend. There was no turning back. We clutched\
  \ hands, took a deep breath and ran for our lives...\n\nJapan is a country of extreme\
  \ contrasts. On one hand you have exceedingly polite people who uphold honour and\
  \ rationality. On the other hand, you have a country that is the undisputed leader\
  \ of horror with a population who love to scare the crap out of themselves. So that\u2019\
  s how I found myself in an abandoned hospital being chased by zombies. Welcome to\
  \ Fuji-Q Highland.\n\nFuji-Q Highland is one of the more spectacularly located amusement\
  \ parks in Japan, a two-hour train ride from Tokyo to the Yamanashi Prefecture at\
  \ the base of Mt Fuji. The park contains several world-record holding roller coasters,\
  \ including the \u201C4th Dimensional\u201D Eejanaika, the 79-metre high Fujiyama,\
  \ and Dodonpa - the fourth fastest roller coaster in the world. All of which give\
  \ you an incredible view of Mt Fuji. \n\nBut for my friend, Melody, the main drawcard\
  \ was a two-storey, 900-metre fake abandoned hospital full of zombified employees\
  \ called: The Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.\n\n\u2018But I hate zombies!\u2019\
  \ I had whined as Melody dragged me to the ride. Unfortunately, I had made her go\
  \ on the fastest ride there so now I owed her.\n\u2018Come on, it\u2019ll be fun,\u2019\
  \ she insisted. \u2018Don\u2019t be a wuss!\u2019\n\nEager to prove I wasn\u2019\
  t scared, I obediently followed, choosing to ignore the rusted barbed wire fences\
  \ and boarded-up windows of the hospital as we lined up with the other willing victims.\n\
  \nOnce we got into the hospital, we sat for a long time in a dimly-lit waiting room\
  \ before we were split up into groups and taken into the ward. No lounge music,\
  \ no bright lights, just the choking scent of musty antiseptic, broken furniture\
  \ and the screams of other victims echoing around us.\nFinally, we were led into\
  \ the ward by masked nurses, who handed us a torch and wished us luck. We followed\
  \ the arrows and climbed the stairs, me leading the way, frantically lighting up\
  \ the ground on either side, convinced something was going to grab my ankles.\n\n\
  The attention to detail was incredible. Broken medical equipment lay on its side,\
  \ bloody sheets hung off railings, beds sat empty, children\u2019s toys were scattered\
  \ about and lights flickered on and off. There was a morgue, several operating theatres\
  \ and a bacteria lab chock full of fake-blood covered (yet enthusiastic) zombie\
  \ actors. I don\u2019t want to give too much away, but there was a lot of screaming,\
  \ running, dead ends and zombies leaping out from behind counters.\n\nHalfway through\
  \ the second floor Melody the zombie lover decided she\u2019d had enough, so we\
  \ braved the rest of the floor to find one of the evacuation points (oddly enough\
  \ only labelled in English).\n\nWe fell into the sunshine, laughing to cover up\
  \ our terror, before doing the walk of shame past people lining up to get in. It\u2019\
  s fair to say our dignity was well and truly lost.\n\nSo we admitted defeat and\
  \ spent the rest of the day taking in the scenery before hopping on a train back\
  \ to Tokyo for a much-needed drink. I think next time I\u2019ll stick to being a\
  \ wuss..."
