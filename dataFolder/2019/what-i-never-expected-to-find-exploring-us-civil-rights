Text: "I arrived in the US for a semester abroad on the eve of a controversial presidential\
  \ inauguration. Standing in line at immigration for over an hour, watching people\
  \ be shouted at and arranged like cattle, I could never have predicted the \u201C\
  Spring Break\u201D I would experience a few weeks later or how much you could learn\
  \ about a country and its spirit through the lens of a historical movement. My exploration\
  \ of the US civil rights movement took me to Atlanta, Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, Montgomery,\
  \ Selma, Gulfport, New Orleans, Little Rock and Memphis. I met people who had experienced\
  \ the movement at its height, people who were fighting to keep it alive today (and\
  \ a baby crocodile called Bruce).\n\nUpon hearing about the \"Civil Rights Pilgrimage\"\
  , I was sceptical. A bunch of mostly white university students from Wisconsin plus\
  \ a pasty British girl traipsing around the American South for one week\u2019s worth\
  \ of civil rights\u2019 experience seemed somehow demeaning to the subject matter.\
  \ The pre and post-trip questionnaires only raised more concerns. Questions included:\
  \ \u201CHow comfortable are you with a person of another race on a scale of 1 to\
  \ 10?\u201D It felt slightly like I had wandered into a conversion camp for bigots.\
  \ Despite this, I figured it was a good way to see more of the country and learn\
  \ about a movement I was curious about. \n\nAfter days of museum after museum on\
  \ the same subject and hours of sleeping (or not) on coaches, I started to feel\
  \ weighted down by the history. It felt like a distant culture, firmly placed in\
  \ the past and in the category of tragedy. After a long day, we were shuttled into\
  \ a hall bookended by floor to ceiling shelves filled with jar upon jar of dirt\
  \ displaying every colour dirt can feasibly be. Each jar contained soil collected\
  \ from the site of a racially motivated lynching in the US. The scale was inescapably\
  \ confronting and the neat rows of carefully collected soil were too unnervingly\
  \ calm for the messy rage it represented. We were sat down and shown a short local\
  \ news clip about an African-American man wrongly imprisoned and put on death row\
  \ for over 30 years. The clip was tragic but would have most likely been lost in\
  \ the great sea of stories and statistics we had heard that day. The door swung\
  \ open and, with considerable gasping from the crowd, the wrongly imprisoned man\
  \ entered. We were already aware of the hard facts of his case but his moving stories\
  \ of imagination and endurance added the humanity. He spoke of his unique tactics\
  \ to combat the isolation, of his celebrity girlfriend keeping him company and of\
  \ his magical visit to Buckingham Palace to meet the Queen. Up to this point, the\
  \ trip had focused on the past, the victories and martyrs of this cause. This man\
  \ forced us the to see the reality of this ongoing story, the story of a man who\
  \ rather than being angry was only regretful of the fact that his mother had died\
  \ a few months before he was set free.       \n\n \nI am not religious and I wasn\u2019\
  t exactly jumping for joy at the thought of attending a service as part of this\
  \ trip. Upon hearing that this was the church that Martin Luther King Jr attended,\
  \ however, my historical curiosity was piqued. We filed into what looked more like\
  \ a modern theatre than the ancient, serious churches I knew back home. What followed\
  \ was a festival of joy and courage, unlike anything I had seen before. It bore\
  \ no resemblance to the exercises in solemnity that I associated with Christian\
  \ church services. For the first time in my life, I actually related to the content\
  \ of a religious ceremony, it didn\u2019t matter that I didn\u2019t believe- the\
  \ vibrant dances, joyful singing and inspiring speeches transcended religion. Much\
  \ like the service, this trip taught me volumes about expectation. Whether it was\
  \ the turbulent experience of a slavery reenactment or eating the best fried chicken\
  \ of my life in a tiny church hall, I learnt more than just the history of a movement.\
  \ I learnt the great variety and resilience of spirit of this country."
