Text: Travelling is my favourite habit and I want to travel around the world, but
  when I travel in any country so I write it, so one the best tour of my career was
  travelling to Africa. When I was travelling to Africa and I was excited to see the
  Africa because it was my dream to travel Africa to see the beauty of that country
  so when I arrived there in Africa and I was really enjoying there,then my uncle
  was living there and he took from the airport and take me to their home and cooked
  some food for me and I ate some food then I took some rest and I slept at my uncle's
  home. When I woke up and take bath after taking bath so then I told my uncle that
  I wanted to travel the some beautiful places of Africa so he took me in the wild
  when I saw wild animals so I was very surprised to see those animals and I told
  my uncle that i always watch these animals in the television so at that time I  took
  some pictures of these animals and I was walking over there with my uncle then I
  saw some people who were different from the other people and we call them junglee
  but they were very happy people when they saw us as they took us to their head and
  their head was very strong and powerful. The main problem was that their language
  was totally different from the world and they were talking with each other so we
  can not understand them so we can not understand their language and they don't know
  our language so it was very difficult to communicate with them so we were talking
  on the basis of handing so we told them that we just wanted to see this jungle and
  I personally told them that I came from the another country to see beauty of your
  country so i came here to see you and want some help from you to take us to the
  whole jungle so they took us and  I was really excited
