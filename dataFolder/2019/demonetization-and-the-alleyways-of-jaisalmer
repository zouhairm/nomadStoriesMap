Text: "I was in the Thar desert of Rajasthan on a trekking expedition when the 2016\
  \ Indian banknote demonetization was declared. The announcement had given India\
  \ quite a sudden and major shock. I, however, was amidst the sand dunes in Sam on\
  \ that chilly November night and the news had little impact on me. The calm of the\
  \ desert had lured me into a false sense of security as I expected the situation\
  \ to stabilize when I finish the trek and face civilization.\n\nReally hit me hard\
  \ three mornings later. Standing outside a closed ATM at Hanuman Chauraha, Jaisalmer\
  \ I counted the money in my purse. I had a little more than Rs. 600 in changes and\
  \ one demonetized 500 rupee note. I had to spend a full day at Jaisalmer and three\
  \ more traveling before reaching home. A decent meal was 100 rupees, room for one\
  \ night 600! My teammates had already left the city though I had stayed back. Jaisalmer,\
  \ standing in the middle of the Thar for almost nine hundred years has a rich history\
  \ and is famous for its golden buildings made of yellow sandstones. I had intended\
  \ to spend the day amongst those famous monuments and museums to revisit the history\
  \ of \u2018Rawals\u2019, the \u2018Kings\u2019 of Jaisalmer. I had also wished to\
  \ attend a puppet show, a traditional art form in the evening.\n \nAll these wishes\
  \ seemed a far cry after I visited five different ATMs in the city spending three\
  \ hours in a vain attempt to withdraw cash. As a consequence of demonetization,\
  \ all those ATMs were either closed or non-functional. Disappointed, I decided to\
  \ walk aimlessly till I get really tired.\n\nI realized after a while that I had\
  \ left the main road, picked up an alley, and had arrived at a marketplace. Handmade\
  \ Rajasthani jewelry was on display there, and turbans. There were showpieces made\
  \ of yellow sandstone too. The sunlight upon reflecting on them was creating an\
  \ illusion as if they were made of gold. My mood uplifted a bit. I felt hungry.\
  \ On one corner of the marketplace, there was a shop of Kachori-jalebi, the local\
  \ snacks. I ate three kachories and moved on to another alleyway.\n\nThis time I\
  \ noticed the alleys carefully as I walked through them. They all looked alike,\
  \ narrow stone pavements in the middle of towering golden houses at both sides.\
  \ I was amazed to notice Jharokhas, a traditional overhanging balcony on some of\
  \ the common houses, something I had expected only on palaces. These alleys are\
  \ the veins of this old city, meeting at its heart at Trikuta, where the famous\
  \ golden Fort of Jaisalmer stands. As I approached the fort, the number of houses\
  \ grew lesser on the sides, being replaced by street vendors. Soon I arrived at\
  \ \u2018Akhri pol\u2019, the first gate of the fort. Entering, I smiled as the structure\
  \ inside the massive sandstone walls resembled the city outside. It had the palace\
  \ of Rawals at its heart and other palaces connected to it by several passageways.\
  \ The fort is a living fort, in the sense that people live inside the fort walls\
  \ till today. The palace of Rawals had been turned into a museum, but I had to refrain\
  \ myself from going in as it had a 100 rupees ticket per person. I visited the seven\
  \ magnificent Jain temples inside the fort though. Dedicated to seven Jain Tirthankaras,\
  \ the temples have breathtakingly beautiful and detailed intricate sculptures on\
  \ their walls and ceilings.\n \nGetting out of the fort, I went to Gadisar Lake\
  \ to watch the Sunset. I had to miss the puppet show in the evening for it cost\
  \ Rs. 700 per person, but did enjoy a puppet dance at a \u2018chawk\u2019 accompanied\
  \ by live music and fire by a local group. I even tried to learn to play \u2018\
  Morchang\u2019, another local music instrument from them.\n\nDemonetization was\
  \ cruel on me in a way, not letting me spend my day as I planned. At the same time,\
  \ it helped me find life in the alleys of an alien city as I never would have.\n\
  \nI had even found a diner-cum-dorm in those alleys to spend my night only for Rs.\
  \ 200."
