Text: "My flip-flop clad feet are covered in sewage after a sunrise walk around Varanasi\
  \ in the rain, and my knee is still bleeding from where I slipped on the cobbled\
  \ street.  But I don\u2019t mind.  I am standing, slightly dishevelled, yet in awe,\
  \ peering into the home of a withered old man.  \u201CThe happiest man in Varanasi\u201D\
  \ our guide proclaims.  Before long I begin to understand why.\n\nVaranasi is an\
  \ assault on the senses.  Life bursts out of the city and simultaneously seeps away\
  \ into the river Ganges.  The streets swarm with vehicles, pedestrians and livestock,\
  \ all surging forwards like ants attacking a leaf, only to halt moments later as\
  \ the road narrows again.  The noise of traffic battles with workshop machinery\
  \ and chanting pilgrims, punctuated by contemplative gongs and bells from nearby\
  \ temples.  Incense from the temples mixes with the scent of milk, petals and tea,\
  \ which only slightly sweetens the smell of burning bodies from the cremation pyres\
  \ which burn 24 hours a day.\n\nIn a city where life\u2019s expiration and frailty\
  \ are all too obvious the inhabitants grasp every chance to live.  Earlier this\
  \ morning we witnessed men, women and children bathing in, and collecting water\
  \ from, the sacred Ganges.  Now priests sit under umbrellas offering blessings and\
  \ locals float along the river from one ghat to another.  There has already been\
  \ plenty of laughter and joking as the sun rises on another day of chaos.\n\nWe\
  \ leave the ghats and move through the throng of pilgrims dressed in orange.  Then\
  \ stroll past children walking hand in hand to school along the winding streets\
  \ and I notice dogs sleeping in shrines and cows making their way about town.  The\
  \ sound of a bearded gentleman playing a wooden flute drifts past us to the street\
  \ vendors selling food and drink.\n\nEverything becomes still as we near the next\
  \ stage on our journey.  Along another cobbled street is an open window.  Not a\
  \ small window, this is a hole in pretty much the entire fourth wall of a humble,\
  \ patchwork plaster room, which is dimly lit and has one sole occupant.  \u201C\
  The happiest man in Varanasi\u201D we are told.   The room is so dim and he so dark\
  \ and withered that only his bright eyes shine out of the gloom.\n\nAs my eyes adjust\
  \ to the interior I recognise the shapes of stacked boxes and bottles along the\
  \ walls.  The room is tiny; barely wide enough for him to sit, cross-legged, on\
  \ the floor amongst his scant belongings.  He knows as much English as anyone else\
  \ on the street, \"hello\", but our guide translates my questions to him.  He doesn\u2019\
  t know how old he is - he estimates perhaps between eighty or ninety - but age holds\
  \ little interest to him.  He sells remedies for a living and doesn\u2019t want\
  \ for anything. He is content as he sits peeling potatoes for his breakfast, totally\
  \ absorbed in the task of simply staying alive.  He becomes animated as he interacts\
  \ with visitors to his home.  When he smiles his teeth glint in the darkness and\
  \ his entire face lights up the room.  I suddenly get it.  This man is happy just\
  \ as he is.  A stark reminder for me that happiness is as simple as being able to\
  \ take a breath each morning.  He has no prejudice, only an open heart.  He is engrossed\
  \ in the dirty business of living and making the most of each day on this earth.\
  \  Despite my filthy feet I feel it too, the warmth of happiness.  It\u2019s contagious.\
  \  Be sure to spread it wherever you go."
