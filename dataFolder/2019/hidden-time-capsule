Text: I was finally fluent enough in Portuguese to have a decent conversation and
  suddenly I found myself in another world entirely. We trekked up several hills with
  stunning overlooks and continued on a road that seemed to extend far beyond what
  I even thought possible. A family had invited us for Sunday lunch and I was glad
  for a chance to stretch my legs and explore the countryside. We were in a remote
  part of Southern Brazil where the lush landscape hid pockets of history. We arrived
  at a modest home (with a prominent outhouse in the front) and began to share in
  a feast of roasted meat. The Brazilian tradition of churrasco filled the air with
  intense aroma and our stomachs were anxious to enjoy. Very quickly the Portuguese
  that I had worked so hard to learn was rendered useless. This family was one of
  many who settled in southern Brazil from Germany around the time of World War II.
  Nestled in these mountains was a preserved dialect of German unique to the immigrants
  who settled here generations earlier. Here in this gorgeous countryside, eating
  traditional Brazilian barbecue, I couldn't understand a word of what was being said
  around me. It was like I had entered into a hidden time capsule, an amalgamation
  of cultures and language. And I was the foreigner in more ways than one. That day
  was an exercise in good humor and makeshift sign language. I will never know exactly
  what was exchanged between the family members about my presence, but I learned quickly
  that good humor (and good food) can lead you to the most unexpected times and places.
