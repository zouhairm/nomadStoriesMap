Text: "( Exerpted from my account of a hastily-organised trip to my cousin Nick\u2019\
  s wedding in Ireland, where he lives )...\n\nTravel tip for UK to Ireland passengers\
  \ navigating Dublin Airport terminals: Always look for a nun in a wheelchair, and\
  \ follow them.\n\nUpon my arrival at Dublin Airport, I immediately exited the terminal\
  \ to await the AirCoach bus connection to Bray. There was a whole army of people\
  \ in AirCoach uniforms, and being a rather anxious traveller, I asked one of them\
  \ when the next departure was. He rather oddly pointed at the tray of chicken chow\
  \ mein that he held in front of his face. I stood there expectantly waiting for\
  \ him to finish his mouthful, not wanting to appear rude by going off and asking\
  \ another staff member. He then chowed down on a second mouthful, and furtively\
  \ followed this with a step backward behind a railing. Avoiding any further eye\
  \ contact, he proceeded to act as if he had suddenly made himself completely invisible.\
  \ Surmising that the chow mein was some kind of religious observance, and not to\
  \ be interrupted under any circumstances, I approached another AirCoach employee\
  \ who confidently told me the next bus was at five. I was puzzled again, because\
  \ from memory I was sure I could get one at half past four. How could I know this\
  \ guy\u2019s job better than he does?\nEventually, the four-thirty showed up, and\
  \ I got a return ticket for \u20AC17. It took an hour to get to Bray, and I got\
  \ off expecting to see a line of taxis to whisk me to the wedding. There were none,\
  \ just a bustling Seventies-style row of shops. The butcher\u2019s looked the least\
  \ busy, so I went in and asked him where I could get a cab. The local accent is\
  \ impenetrable at the best of times, and when softly-spoken, even more so. He turned\
  \ and started to make phone calls as if I wasn\u2019t there, and after the AirCoach\
  \ experience, I nearly left to go next door. Unexpectedly, he turned to me and said,\
  \ \u2018It\u2019ll be here in ten minutes, go and stand by the phone box on the\
  \ main road.\u2019 I thanked the gentleman and a few minutes later the cab arrived,\
  \ speeding me out of town and into the beautiful countryside. I was deposited in\
  \ front of Summer Hill House Hotel, located in a scenic spot surrounded by the dramatic\
  \ hills of verdant Wicklow.\nSpotted by Nick\u2019s mom Wendy, who projected my\
  \ name across the banquet hall in her finest RADA accent ( prompting a round of\
  \ applause ) I raised my fist triumphantly, as an immediate pile-on of family members\
  \ ensued. As usual, I had missed the actual ceremony, but had made it in time for\
  \ the free food. Yes!\nNick led me to my seat, where I was greeted by the voluble\
  \ Neil, Man-of-Letters, member of a famous Irish journalism clan. On my other side\
  \ was Nick\u2019s youngest, fourteen year-old Fionn. \nEager to chat, Neil told\
  \ me he\u2019s currently working on a play with a friend.\n\u2018What\u2019s it\
  \ about?\u2019 I asked.\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s about some things, but\
  \ then again, it isn\u2019t. \n'You can\u2019t tell me anything else?'\n'Well, it's\
  \ about two blokes in a flat. When it\u2019s finished, I\u2019ll send you the script.\u2019\
  \n\u2018Great,\u2019 I said, \u2018I fancy a laugh.\u2019\n\u2018Oh, it\u2019s not\
  \ a comedy. It\u2019s more a profound meditation on sorrow and grief.\u2019\nHe\
  \ paused, a blob of mash suspended on his fork, \u2018But then again\u2026\u2019\
  \nThe food - unlike the usual wedding fare - was very good, although hardly indigenous.\
  \ Neil and I had the chicken wrapped in parma ham, with a huge dollop of mash, whereas\
  \ my diminutive cousin Fionn, in keeping with his Buddhist ideology, ate some kind\
  \ of aubergine derivative and was assured by the staff that the gravy was ethically\
  \ sourced from only the most relaxed vegetables. ( I myself am sympathetic with\
  \ Fionn\u2019s views: I cannot eat anything with eyes - therefore I only eat meat\
  \ from an animal which has been blinded first ).\nThe wedding cake was also very\
  \ good, with two handy layers - one being a chocolate and biscuit combo, the other,\
  \ the traditional fruit option for the masochists.\nEnd of exerpt."
