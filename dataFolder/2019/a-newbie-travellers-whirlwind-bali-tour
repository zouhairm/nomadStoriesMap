Text: "I travelled to Bali with friends for a whistlestop two weeks in August. We\
  \ were complete travel novices, having not one gap year between us, and so Bali\
  \ seemed like a pretty safe first choice in which to dip our toes. We\u2019d seen\
  \ many an idyllic looking instagram post of the myriad tourist hotspots and so without\
  \ a second thought we booked our flights and plotted a vague itinerary before heading\
  \ off to see what all the fuss was about. Who knew, maybe we\u2019d \u201Cfind ourselves\u201D\
  !\n\n\nTouching down in Seminyak at 1am was quite the culture shock. Having never\
  \ ventured beyond Europe, I was instantly struck by the intense heat and smells\
  \ of this strange new place on the other side of the world. Seminyak served as our\
  \ starting base from which to find our feet before exploring more of the island,\
  \ and for this it was ideal. Possessing all of the mod cons and a trendy boutique\
  \ around every corner, we were in our element for a day or two. However, this area\
  \ felt crowded and noisy, and we were soon keen to escape further.\n\n\nUbud was\
  \ definitely closer to what we were looking for and we were regretful that we couldn't\
  \ have spent more time there. Although bigger and busier than expected, Ubud has\
  \ an undeniably cooler vibe than Seminyak with its identikit streets and restaurants.\n\
  \nOur accommodation in Ubud was particularly special, a small hut in a traditional\
  \ Balinese style with ornate dark wood doors and walls, set in a rainforest garden\
  \ which was constantly abuzz with the sound of various insect life. We even had\
  \ an outdoor bathroom meaning we could shower in the open air under a canopy of\
  \ tropical leaves - although my travel companions were less impressed with this\
  \ feature! \n\n\nFollowing the whirlwind of Seminyak and our fleeting Ubud experience\
  \ (complete with obligatory sunrise mountain trek!), sleepy Sanur was just what\
  \ we needed. This little fishing port provided the ideal few days respite before\
  \ our final stop. We took the opportunity here to slow down and relax on the beach.\
  \ We did take one day out of our time here to go on a snorkelling boat trip, which\
  \ was definitely a must, albeit a little hectic on the organisation side (as is\
  \ everything in Bali). We travelled by boat from Sanur to the nearby island of Nusa\
  \ Lembongan, stopping at various snorkelling locations. These certainly didn\u2019\
  t disappoint, with crystal clear water and a breathtaking array of beautiful tropical\
  \ fish and coral reef, we even saw manta rays! \n\n\nIt felt like we\u2019d finally\
  \ found what we were looking for when we arrived in Canggu for our last few days\
  \ in Bali. A surfing hotspot, Canggu encompasses the quiet of the islands, but with\
  \ all the cool vibes of Ubud, and none of the hustle and bustle of nearby Seminyak.\
  \ Our hotel was perfectly situated a stones throw from Echo beach and Batu Bolong,\
  \ and we took full advantage of this proximity to make the most of the amazing surf.\
  \ Surfing in Bali is an experience not to be missed - as much for the warm water\
  \ as for the great waves, and this was probably my favourite experience of the entire\
  \ trip. \n\n\nWhen we tired of surfing we explored a little more of Canggu, before\
  \ heading back to the beach for a sunset walk. Here we stumbled across Old Man\u2019\
  s - a beachfront beer garden/late night hot spot, and couldn\u2019t help but join\
  \ the party. If you\u2019re in Bali and feel in need of an evening of Bintang beers\
  \ and dancing, Old Man\u2019s is a must!\n\n\nWe concluded our Bali trip having\
  \ done a huge amount in a short time but feeling like there was still so much more\
  \ to see! Bali is such a tourist magnet and on some occasions what we saw felt jarringly\
  \ different to the dreamy photographs of secluded waterfalls, remote rice terraces\
  \ and unspoilt beaches that had led us there in the first place. That being said,\
  \ this little island has an undeniable charm and many a hidden gem and in many ways\
  \ was just what we needed for our first foray into the travelling experience. Bring\
  \ on the next adventure!"
