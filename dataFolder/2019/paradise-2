Text: "After tireless hours on a bus across the border, I woke up to a pinch of sunlight\
  \ that felt warm like my grandmas garden. The many morning moans of hungover hearts\
  \ all sang together in harmony. The bus smelled of wine, beer, and classy regrets.\
  \ A true bucket list achievement for university students.\n\nI was a stranger among\
  \ the minds of european natives. It was spring break. I wanted to be free from the\
  \ books that devoured my spirit. To travel somewhere wild, yet inviting like a cup\
  \ of tea in the afternoon. Or at least, that\u2019s how the British say.\n\nWe finally\
  \ arrived. The beginning of the end. I never been so grateful to get off a bus in\
  \ my entire life. The journey was so long, but the memories are something I\u2019\
  ll always look back and think, \u201CI should of taken the plane\u201D.\n\nBeing\
  \ in Spain was the best. Soon as we got to the hotel, I changed into my bathing\
  \ suit top, put on my high waisted shorts, and worked the streets like it was my\
  \ job. No, I\u2019m not a stripper. I\u2019m 24 and on vacation. Living my best\
  \ life.\n\nThe first night out was basically a contest to see who could even make\
  \ it to the club. We had one unfortunate soul, but the rest of us pushed through\
  \ our slurs of pure disappointment and laughter. Before sleep, we would wobble over\
  \ to the shops, eating 4am pizzas together. The only logical decision drunk people\
  \ can make at that time. Ask anyone. It\u2019s true.\n\nDuring the day, we would\
  \ make our seperate ways. If there is anything that I can recall, it\u2019s the\
  \ ocean. I walked with a few friends up a cliff, where we could see the locals at\
  \ the beach below. The breeze and seagulls gave a calm vibe to the scene. It was\
  \ midday. \n\nI walked away from the group, taking steps towards the edge of that\
  \ same cliff. I looked out to the sea. The reflection of the sun sparkled like stars\
  \ dancing on water. To this day, I still can\u2019t recall anything more beautiful.\
  \ A once in a lifetime feeling.\n\nWhile standing there, I also became lost in thought.\
  \ Since I come from such a large country, visiting Spain showed me a surreal understanding\
  \ of the world. There is so much we don\u2019t know and a lot that we judge. Between\
  \ politics and violence, we lose sight of the simple things. \n\nSitting at a bar\
  \ and sharing large vodka smoothies, playing arcade games, pulling pranks, running\
  \ along the ocean\u2019s shore, and making new friends. I still rememebr that same\
  \ blue water view from the cliff. It flows with the world, like day and night. \n\
  \nThe true meaning of paradise."
