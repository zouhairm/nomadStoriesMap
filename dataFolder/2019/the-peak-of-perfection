Text: "Otto stopped in his tracks. We were hiking alone on the autumn heavy trails\
  \ of Mount Schafberg, Austria. Its peak welcomes unceasing winds as well as a view\
  \ of morning fog sweeping over the cottages below. It was as if Mount Olympus decided\
  \ to relocate to the Austrian countryside. It was surely worth the six-hour round\
  \ trip and, luckily, I was being led by the most tenacious seventy-six-year-old\
  \ tour guide.\n \n\u201CI need a moment to catch my breath,\u201D Otto said. Only,\
  \ he could not catch it. He was breathing too deeply. I spoke no German or Austrian\
  \ and I quietly went into panic mode. I waited patiently and feared that his pride\
  \ would lead him to make the wrong decision, to keep climbing.\n \nEven at the age\
  \ of seventy-six, Otto is a running, hiking, and skiing enthusiast. In the summer,\
  \ he runs a ten-mile loop around Lake Fuschl four times a week. During the spring\
  \ and fall, he and his friends hike to at least three peaks per week. In the winter,\
  \ Otto and his skiing buddies hit the thickly powdered slopes in the Salzkammergut\
  \ on a weekly basis. Otto\u2019s bliss comes from adventure and I wondered how his\
  \ hobbies and passions would change as he aged.\n \nIn truth, he seemed indestructible.\
  \ His build was that of a thirty-year old runner, slim and strong. His eyes matched\
  \ the crystal-clear center of Lake Fuschl, the place he had called \u201Chome\u201D\
  \ for the last forty years. From the moment I arrived, he proclaimed his fitness\
  \ expertise and it was clear that he did not expect much of my abilities at first.\
  \ For some reason, I had to prove myself. Maybe that was the unspoken price of living\
  \ under his roof. It seemed as though Otto always had something to prove. I wished\
  \ in that moment on the mountain trail, that he could let this one go. \n \nBack\
  \ on the winding and rooted trail, I glanced up and down the path for signs of other\
  \ hikers. Otto turned to me, his right hand still hovering over his heart, and begrudgingly\
  \ said, \u201CI can\u2019t go on.\u201D I could feel his disappointment, and his\
  \ face was now stained with scarlet frustration. We walked back down the mountain\
  \ to the beat of Otto\u2019s incessant apologies and I wondered why my opinion mattered\
  \ so much to him. Once we got back to the car, I caught a glimpse of Otto looking\
  \ up at Schafberg\u2019s peak. I took that moment to say, \u201CIt\u2019s okay,\
  \ next time.\u201D He smiled, and in that moment, I hoped that he still felt limitless."
