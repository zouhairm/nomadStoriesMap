Text: "The Travel is a new life \n   One moment I feel executed from the word, staying\
  \ at home without doing anything! Family around me but never feel it. Feeling tired\
  \ from trying to look fine, happy...because nothing happened as I planned it, studied\
  \ in the right filed, being with someone I loved! I failed three times to get the\
  \ average to be accepted in the English department, I filed to save the one I love!\
  \ I lose control on myself. Until my father decides to go for a short trip, I wasn\u2019\
  t really excited to travel with family it like get in trouble!  \n     On 12 august\
  \ 2018, was a sunny day, a quiet wind, roses smell and birds singing, I drink my\
  \ coffee enjoying that day and thinking what is next! I started  preparing my baggage\
  \ and every things I need for this trip, I have to be on the time 08:00 am , all\
  \ my family were so happy because we went to a new city Boumerdes,Algeria we never\
  \ visited before, so this was the first time but for me it was like any other  cities\
  \ . I get on the car and I sat next to the window as long as it my favorite place\
  \ , and I guess every body do , we all want to discover the rote or  actually to\
  \ run from the reality , I kept looking to the natural , trees , when I opened the\
  \ window the winds hit in my face slowly , it was best moment , I feel it  like\
  \ I am flying   with this wind and forgot everyone and everything just flying .\
  \ I was heartbroken could not focus what going in on and could not control on myself.\n\
  \    We arrived at 12.00 am  to Boumerdes city , the first thing I saw it and attracted\
  \ me is The Beach with mix two colour blue and green , bleu sky , beach \u2018s\
  \ smell , new people , new language .Boumerdes is located in the east of Algeria\
  \ near to Kabyle and they speak a second language Tamazight which some cities speak\
  \ it, my parent went to see the apartment and I walked for a few miters to see the\
  \ beach better from the mountain , I saw people down some swim , some play, parasols\
  \ are organized like one line that was a nice picture . We went to restaurant for\
  \ lunch, the server notice that we are new people! Everybody can do. in the evening\
  \ I went to the beach there were many different people from different cities, they\
  \ were so happy, kids play with their parents, I kept looking and thinking why those\
  \ people are happy and I\u2018m not ? I start ask myself some question I could not\
  \ answer it\u2026I watched the mix of the sunset color with the beach , the sounds\
  \ of waves, wind, people laugh, If these sounds unite, they become a piece of music.\
  \ \n   The next day, I wake up early, I drank my coffee then my destination was\
  \ to the beach.. because I decide to enjoy my life especially those holidays, if\
  \ I\u2019m not going to enjoy it right now, I will never enjoy my life, I found\
  \ the beach flat like a table with a quiet waves, I jumped in the heart of the sea\
  \ I lay down on the water and left my soul and my body seized by the water because\
  \ it took all my sorrow and let the sun burn all my tears. I met new people, making\
  \ new friends from others cities, I discover Boumerdes by visiting some tourist\
  \ places such sablier, zammouri\u2026 I spent all the day out, at night we had the\
  \ diner out, I share it with my family, is was at Front de mer (sea front) it is\
  \ a famous place at Boumerde and we had the chance to see live sing by famous rapper.\n\
  \    I notice that I am better then I was, I\u2018m not anymore sad, hopeless eventually\
  \ I \u2018am hopeful. The travel was fuel gave me energy here I discover the travel\
  \ is a new life."
