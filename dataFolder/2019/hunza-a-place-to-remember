Text: "I am a mountainous guy and I love to explore new places. It was a cool spring\
  \ morning when my team and I started our journey from home to a heavenly valley\
  \ known as Hunza. The beautiful spring blossom added more colors to the memorable\
  \ journey. The journey started on the seventh wonder of the world known as the Karakorum\
  \ Highway (Initially known as the Silk Route) which joins Pakistan to the Republic\
  \ of China. The highway is around 1600 km long in length. After a continuous journey\
  \ of four hours, we reached one of the world\u2019s famous and hearth touching Rakaposhi\
  \ viewpoint. From here one can easily see one of the world\u2019s highest peak the\
  \ Rakaposhi. A thirty minutes tea break under the mighty snowcapped mountains was\
  \ worth remembering. We again started our journey to the next destination which\
  \ was Baltit Fort Hunza. After another thirty minutes journey, we reached the Baltit\
  \ Fort which is considered one of the oldest heritage sites of the province. Being\
  \ an Urban Planner, a stay of an hour in such a rich heritage site was one of the\
  \ best experiences for me personally. We took our lunch in a local hotel where the\
  \ homemade foods add more glory to the journey. Finally, we reached our final destination\
  \ which was the Atta Abad Lake. According to the locals, the lake was formed back\
  \ in 2010 when a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) hit the region. The mesmerizing\
  \ view of blueish Atta Abad Lake was something to be remembered forever. The final\
  \ salty tea ends the journey here. We returned back home around another four hours\
  \ journey.\nMy experience in the district where the enrollment rate is 100% was\
  \ amazing. I was not expecting to find such beautiful things in the extreme northern\
  \ Hunza.  After going through this memorable journey, I found some observations.\
  \ First of all, what I heard about the place and what I witnessed there was totally\
  \ opposite. People used to criticize the people of Hunza valley, but we found them\
  \ very humble and hospitable. Secondly, God has blessed the planet earth with a\
  \ variety of natural resources, the thing here is to explore them and take a maximum\
  \ benefit out of it. Lastly, being human beings we should respect the differences\
  \ exist among us. Life is so beautiful in a diverse culture. All in all, I conclude\
  \ that a life close to nature is a life worthwhile."
