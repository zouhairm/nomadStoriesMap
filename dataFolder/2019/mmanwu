Text: "Every year, for Christmas and new years Igbo people living in southwest Nigeria\
  \ return to their ancestral home in the east. I call this \u201CThe Return.\u201D\
  \ In 2005, my family and I went on one of these trips. I was not particularly excited.\
  \ Born and raised in the west, I did not consider this place home. Also, as a city\
  \ kid, I believed the village had no stories I cared to bring back. \nFew days into\
  \ our trip, on what would usually be a bustling morning filled with laughter, music,\
  \ cockcrows, and activities, there was a holy silence. It was Eke, the sacred day\
  \ of the Igbo week and little or no work is done. Instead, the community takes time\
  \ to perform rituals, offer sacrifices, and pray. While my family did not amputate\
  \ any chickens, my grandparents prayed for our blessings in the form of life, health,\
  \ peace, harmony, and prosperity. For me, they said a special prayer- they prayed\
  \ for my Chi to find and guide me. They were evoking my personal god.\nLater that\
  \ day went to Okpala, the village square. This was where the real festivities happen.\
  \ The highlight of Eke days was Mwanwu- the masked celebration masquerades. It was\
  \ believed that when evoked, ancestors would visit from the spirit realm as masked\
  \ masquerades. These masquerades and their masks were physical manifestations of\
  \ ancestors, spirits, and Gods. \nWhen I arrived, the ceremony had begun. The Mmuo\
  \ (spirits) were performing in the middle of the square. Whether I believed or not,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t deny the presence of the forces around me. Immediately, I was\
  \ astonished by the artistic vitality of the Mmuo. Their expression was rich in\
  \ color, patterns, texture, and intricate design. When they moved to music, dancing,\
  \ rotating and leaping through the air, it felt like I was watching aliens perform.\
  \ The rhythm of the drums was firm and loud but not as loud as the joy and cheer\
  \ of the audience. At first, it was overwhelming. I didn\u2019t know what to do\
  \ or how I fit in the picture. So I stood close to my aunty, observing with awe\
  \ and enthusiastic admiration. \n\nAt some point, a Mmanwu minstrel invites the\
  \ audience to participate in the art of chanting. He is leading spirits into our\
  \ world, and it is only fair he invites us into theirs. He is moving like wind through\
  \ the crowd, free and loud. We are mesmerized by his voice, motion, the colors and\
  \ the fantasy of this experience. Dust raised, people chanting, between dance and\
  \ movement, I am immersed completely. In what felt like a millisecond, I am standing\
  \ eye to eye with a masquerade. A Giant wooden black mask with red lips two horns\
  \ and three red dots on its forehead. It was grotesque, and I was terrified. When\
  \ I came out of  my shock, I heard it:\n\n\u201CCan you cast a spell\nIf you are\
  \ not a spirit \nCan you cast a spell?\u201D\n\nAt this moment, I realized that\
  \ this masquerade was just as spellbound by me as I was by it. I had demystified\
  \ it, and it did the same to me. This was us sharing a connection. This was my Chi\
  \ finding me. Like me, the Mmuo were artists, storytellers, and from out of this\
  \ world. Nevertheless, we were both from the same place, here.\n\nIn this part of\
  \ the world, when the truth must be told with great courage, the masquerade appears.\
  \ For me, I needed to be aware of the truth that this is home. This is a story of\
  \ discovery and acceptance. On this trip, I found an identity and a part of myself\
  \ I didn\u2019t want to believe existed. And for this, I am more complete. So every\
  \ time I make this trip, I am open and excited. I remember my grandparents' prayer\
  \ and allow my Chi to guide me in discovering treasures in new truths and stories\
  \ about myself and my people. \n\nMy experience is captured in the poem \u201CThe\
  \ treasure at Home\u201D by Eenwa-Ohaeto. He writes:\n\n\u201CIt is the treasure\
  \ at home\nThat beckons the masquerade\n\nOur treasures cannot be lost\nThere are\
  \ memories that remember.\u201D"
