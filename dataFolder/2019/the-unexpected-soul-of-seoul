Text: "First time in Asia. Lot of pictures seen on the internet, but still without\
  \ an idea of what to expect. K-dramas and K-pop gave a hint of its new culture,\
  \ but leaving aside a great deal of the Old costumes. With that in mind, we (my\
  \ mother and I) arrived at Incheon Airport (Korea), after 24 hours travelling from\
  \ Chile, in a summer day of July.\n\nMy first impression was seen a huge, modern\
  \ and luminous airport, in which you feel that you have travelled through time instead\
  \ of space, with high-tech toilets that counted with more functions than needed,\
  \ machines that made immigration easy peasy and spoke with you in the language of\
  \ your country's passport. With a staff that, even if they didn't speak English\
  \ perfectly, tried to do everything they could to help you, we managed to grab a\
  \ bus that left us in the area we were going to stay in, Myeng-dong, the Korean\
  \ capital of cosmetics. \n\nAfter checking in in the hotel, we decided to go out\
  \ and see what Seoul had to offer to a pair of tired travelers at 10 pm. And so\
  \ we walk just two squares and we saw it, the crowded streets of the heart of Myeng-dong.\
  \ Filled with cosmetic stores like Nature Republic, innisfree and The Face Shop,\
  \ restaurants that are highly rated in the web and clothing stores from international\
  \ and South Korean brands, these streets had things to see, shop and eat for every\
  \ taste.\n\nOn the next morning, first thing we do was eating breakfast. We went\
  \ for a traditional one which differed absolutely from every concept we had on breakfast.\
  \ They had options like noodle soup, Korean side dishes, called banchan, like kimchi,\
  \ spicy squid, seaweed, rice porridge, among others. I tried them all and I had\
  \ no disappointment, all the dishes were exquisite, changing my perception of what\
  \ is acceptable to eat at that meal.\n\nThat day we took the city tour bus, and\
  \ it was really good and efficient. It always arrived on the estimated time, and\
  \ had three courses that, once done all three, you can say that you sightsaw all\
  \ of Seoul, as it stops in every landmark of the city. With it, you can go to N\
  \ Seoul Tower, with spectacular views of the city and even North Korea, Gyeongbokgung\
  \ palace, Bukchon Hanok Village, with traditional houses and tea shops, and even\
  \ to Gangnam.\n\nOne of our stops was Dongdaemun, an area that combines a contemporary\
  \ building called Design Plaza with dozens of malls. This is the shopping area for\
  \ excellence, but be warned that their concept of malls are different. These are\
  \ tall buildings without stores properly delimitated, therefore, they look like\
  \ a huge department store. The greatest aspect of them is that they give a space\
  \ for local designers, which makes it a place to find unique clothing and accessories.\n\
  \nMy favorite stop of all was Namsangol hanok village, a village that preserved\
  \ traditional housing, with beautiful gardens and lakes, in which I didn't just\
  \ lose the track of time, but I also felt I was living in 1500s Seoul, thought that\
  \ was reinforced by people who rented hanboks, Korea's traditional dress, and wandered\
  \ around the village. It was like I had an astral travel to the past of the country,\
  \ witnessing the daily life of its inhabitants. Having said this, this place fulfills\
  \ its duty of being a faithful representation of what Seoul was, giving travelers\
  \ the experience of going through the history of the city.\n\nAs for food, I ate\
  \ mostly Korean BBQ, with some pat (sweet red bean) stuffed bun for dessert and\
  \ sikhye (a sweet rice beverage) for drinking, as this were my absolute favorites.\
  \ Surprisingly, food was cheap, two persons could have a complete and abundant meal\
  \ for less than 15 dollars in most places, which makes the food even more tasteful.\n\
  \nWe only had three days in Seoul, as we travelled to Jeju afterwards, but it was\
  \ enough for me to fall in love with the city. Certainly, it is one of my favorites\
  \ cities in the world, competing with Prague and Mexico DF, and I am expectant for\
  \ a return."
