Text: "How do you make sense of something even after years past? How can travel be\
  \ felt so deeply, yet be so incredibly finite. Passports created, tickets purchased,\
  \ airline miles, check in dates, boarding passes, the ticking of the clocks and\
  \ the searching for your gate and the reminders of time zone changes. It seems best\
  \ then to reflect and ponder on travel. So here I am, pondering years later a spring\
  \ break trip to Spain, where my family and I would be catching up with my older\
  \ brother Jack, who would be our sometime tour guide of the city where he was studying\
  \ abroad in college. For an anxious Junior in Highschool; a trip to a country with\
  \ a vast history and exquisite culture, the plan to travel sounded incredible. \n\
  My first impression is that Spain draws you in. That was my first impression. From\
  \ the window of the airplane, arriving in Barcelona the white washed buildings,\
  \ houses bathed in the honey colored rays of sun, Barcelona already had my heart\
  \ and I had not set foot on the tarmac yet. Before navigating such monumental sights\
  \ like the Sagrada Familia, it was first nice to get settled in and catch up with\
  \ my brother. The Ramblas, the main street for walking and the host of various vendors,\
  \ music and activities welcomed us. The Ramblas also leads to Columbus monument\
  \ on the Passeig de Colom near the marina. Columbus, it would seem, would be found\
  \ in various monuments throughout Spain, partnered as well with Queen Isabella.\
  \ Colombus, as his legacy as colonizer in chief of the Americas, would be nothing\
  \ without the support of Ferdinand and Isabella, or without the Doctrine of Discovery\
  \ Papal Bull of 1493. We were unequivocally in Columbus\u2019s territory. In the\
  \ days that would follow we would bump into street performers as well as Sardana\
  \ dancers outside the Cathedral with the local band (cobla) playing on in a display\
  \ of Catalan pride. However, more humbling moments from travel would provide awe\
  \ that would be hard to replicate. \nThe Sagrada Familia, an incredible Cathedral,\
  \ UNESCO Heritage site and Antoni Gaudi\u2019s masterpiece is a testament to the\
  \ creativity and legacy of Gaudi, and its intersection in history, including the\
  \ interruptions in its construction due to the Spanish Civil War in. The Catalan\
  \ Art Nouveau or Modernisme became a part of Gaudi\u2019s legacy and the awe of\
  \ the many visitors. Walking through the Sagrada Familia provided a calm that was\
  \ almost unfathomable considering how many other people were there visiting. The\
  \ architecture itself was hypnotizing. But it wasn\u2019t until we started walking\
  \ up the long spires and up the various tight staircases that we were able to see\
  \ through the towers, the enormous arms of the cathedral that we could see an astounding\
  \ birds eye view of the city. The various neighborhoods, parks, cyclists, the trees\
  \ popping out of the concrete, the zig zagging streets. Out of breath from climbing\
  \ the stairs we hurried back down to continue to explore. One of the more stunning\
  \ and confusing designs that we noticed were that the columns throughout the cathedral\
  \ looked like trees, as though they were growing out of the marble and lit by the\
  \ sun coming through the windows. In deadpan timing my brother looked at me and\
  \ said \u201CDoesn\u2019t this look like Lord of the Rings?\u201D.  As we finished\
  \ the tour, we stopped by the museum housed inside. There was a large document written\
  \ about the various architects and artists building off of Gaudi\u2019s legacy.\
  \ There were sketches that resembled the various cloaked statues we saw throughout\
  \ the chapel. The cloaks, gaunt faces and ethereal way the clothes hung on the body\
  \ looked familiar: \n\u201CDoesn\u2019t it look like the animation sequence from\
  \ the Deathly Hallows?\u201D, another sly observation by my brother. Fitting, the\
  \ sequence from the film mentioned the three brothers who escaped death, one of\
  \ the myths from the final book from the Harry Potter series. Death, was a cloaked\
  \ figure, though tall and cloaked, was never threatening. Fitting  that these figures\
  \ that resembled the Deathly Hallows, the lessons of mortality and morality hiding\
  \ in the statue figures in the nooks and crannies of the cathedral."
