Text: "Our bus driver was a Muslim man with slowly-graying hair, and a pair of black,\
  \ drug-store sunglasses.  They helped prevent him from squinting when he navigated\
  \ Jerusalem\u2019s  streets filled with identical, white limestone buildings.  Whenever\
  \ our group entered the bus, he would offer a slight head nod and a warm smile towards\
  \ us, to relay a greeting that his words couldn\u2019t.  He was very quiet.  I sat\
  \ in the front of the bus, directly behind him, and never heard so much as a hum\
  \ or a cough from him.\n\nOur tour guide was not quiet (though I\u2019m pretty sure\
  \ that\u2019s one of the credentials for being a tour guide).  She  was a lovely\
  \ Jewish woman with a sing-song voice that made it easy to listen to her for hours\
  \ each day.  She held her course, black curls back from her face in a butterfly\
  \ clip.  She reminded me of some kind of \u2018traveling librarian.\u2019  She often\
  \ pushed her sweaty glasses as far up the bridge of her nose as she could as she\
  \ bent down to furiously rummage through her bag of travel booklets to find a fact\
  \ that she wished to share with the group.\n\nWe were a group of Christian college\
  \ students hungry to learn (and just plain hungry in general).  We found out that\
  \ a falafel from a street vendor in Tel Aviv will never taste quite as good anywhere\
  \ else, and that Americans pronounce \u201Chummus\u201D completely wrong.  We learned\
  \ about mosques and temples and religion.   We discovered that the politics of Israel\
  \ were more complicated than we originally thought, and that trying to come up with\
  \ any solutions to a problem seemed as impossible and useless as me trying to revive\
  \ my phone that had died after being dropped in the Dead Sea.   \n\nOne afternoon,\
  \ our tour guide announced to us that it was our bus driver\u2019s birthday.  She\
  \ asked for him to stop the bus and join us to view the scenery on a Nazareth hillside.\
  \  Our bus driver soon emerged with a red tin of cookies and two liters of yellow\
  \ soda.  Turned out, it was Ramadan and he was fasting; we were going to be eating\
  \ his birthday cookies for him.  We found some rocks to sit on and attempted to\
  \ sing him \u201CHappy Birthday,\u201D in Hebrew with the promptings of our tour\
  \ guide.  In shaky Arabic, she began to translate for us some questions we had about\
  \ his life, his family, and his religion.  There was a lot of sweat, a lot of awkward\
  \ silence, and a lot of laughter as we passed the fluorescent soda around and chatted\
  \ about our lives and beliefs. \n \nI chewed.  I wondered.  \n\nMaybe the solutions\
  \ to the country\u2019s problems should start with cookies during Ramadan."
