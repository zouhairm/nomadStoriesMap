Text: "When I recall about all my trips, the most unexpected out of all the trips\
  \ I have ever been to, would be my trip to Meghalaya. It was finally that time of\
  \ the year when my sister and I turn into mountain apes. So what other place could\
  \ have been better than the Abode of clouds itself. Hence, on a fateful day we started\
  \ our trip. \n\nIf I have to tell about all the unexpected experiences I had in\
  \ that trip, there are so many incidences that run through my mind. Whether it be\
  \ the unexpected swim that I took in Krangshuri falls with all my warm clothes after\
  \ being instigated by Raj, one of our travel guides from Discover Northeast, a\u201C\
  Traitor\u201D as I call him, or, cliff jumping into the crystal clear water of Dawki\
  \ river; whether it be spending the night in Mawlynnong, the cleanest village in\
  \ Asia and seeing a pitcher plant eat a fly just in front of the homestay we were\
  \ staying in, or, following the tunes of guitar that we could hear from afar in\
  \ the middle of the night; whether being amazed by the fact that the Single Living\
  \ root bridge is handmade from the aerial roots of rubber fig trees by the locals,\
  \ or, getting scared of falling down 3000 ft from the bamboo bridges made by the\
  \ villagers across the many mountains of the scariest trek of Meghalaya, the Mawryngkhang\
  \ trek; whether almost crying (and I am not a crier) while listening to the heart\
  \ wrenching story related to Nohkalikai falls, or, looking through the beauty of\
  \ the seven sisters falls, or, losing the diamond of my sister\u2019s ring, which\
  \ was only the size of a warrior ant\u2019s butt, in the caves of Mawsmai. Everything\
  \ from the beginning till the end was nothing but full of unexpected events. But\
  \ out of all the experiences, my favourite was the time we spent in Cherrapunjee.\
  \ \n\nI was tired from the trek and had fallen asleep inside our warm and cozy car.\
  \ When the car stopped and I jumped out of the car ready to have dinner, the very\
  \ next instant I jumped back inside the car because of course the three nemesis\
  \ conveniently didn\u2019t tell me that it was freezing outside. It looked like\
  \ fog but the place actually was surrounded by clouds. That\u2019s when I realized\
  \ I was really in Cherrapunjee, the wettest place on the planet Earth. One thing\
  \ that I was really happy about was the food in Meghalaya. Not only was it tasty,\
  \ but the portion size was large enough to sate the hunger of a big man. My sister\
  \ had ordered chicken soup and fried rice and couldn\u2019t finish the soup, hence,\
  \ wanted to get it packed. What was hilarious was to see the servers along with\
  \ Raj wreck their brains about how to put the chicken soup inside the small bottle\
  \ as they didn\u2019t have a packaging bowl or a funnel. And finally when the soup\
  \ was ready to go, we started to move towards Sohra, Cherrapunjee. \n\nWhen we reached\
  \ the homestay we were going to spend our night in, Raj and Senapati (another guy\
  \ from Discover Northeast) announced their plan to have a bonfire. After getting\
  \ changed for the night, we went outside. Raj and Senapati had arranged the logs\
  \ and huge iron container for the bonfire. But a bonfire is never complete without\
  \ food to grill on the fire. With no meat in the restaurant of our homestay, Senapati\
  \ was immediately sent to the nearby market. What he could arrange were only eggs\
  \ and papad (Indian crispy chips) and we just put the eggs and papad near the fire\
  \ hoping that they will be cooked enough and praying that the rain wouldn\u2019\
  t spoil our plans. I tried my best to scare them with my scary stories, but my sister\u2019\
  s songs were scarier! Later that night, it started to pour down and stayed that\
  \ way till next morning, true to the claim of Cherrapunjee being the wettest place\
  \ on Earth\n\nAnd the words I carried from this place was \u2018Khublei Shibon\u2019\
  \ (Thank you very much in Khasi)."
