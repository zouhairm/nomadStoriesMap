Text: "After 9 hours of flying over the North Atlantic, I had finally arrived in Paris.\
  \ To say I was tired was an understatement. I am turning 33 in a few days and my\
  \ dream of celebrating a birthday in the Ville de Lumi\xE8re was finally coming\
  \ true. I expected to feel excited and thrilled because this was meant to be a celebratory\
  \ trip \u2013 something I would remember for years to come. As life would have it,\
  \ events up to the trip had changed my perspective and motivation for what I wanted\
  \ from Paris. I went from expecting celebration to needing healing and a sense of\
  \ peace. The day before traveling, I buried a close aunt and weeks prior to that\
  \ I had delved into a deep emotional wound in therapy that left me raw and exposed.\
  \ My Soul was wounded and was in need of some type of soothing balm.\n\nI dreamt\
  \ of visiting Paris since the age of twenty, while in college daydreaming of traveling\
  \ through the world. I imagined doing the typical tourist attractions of meeting\
  \ The Mona Lisa in the Louvre and gazing at the Eiffel Tower as it lit up and glimmered\
  \ against the backdrop of the night. I created visions of walking the cobbled streets\
  \ of the Rue Cr\xE9mieux, admiring the pastel colored buildings while nibbling on\
  \ a buttered croissant, and journeying the timeless labyrinth of the Catacombs that\
  \ lay beneath Paris life. \n\nNow, as I sat in the Uber heading to my friend\u2019\
  s home in the 19th arrondissement, I sensed a heaviness in my chest and lightness\
  \ in my head. \u201CIt must be the jet lag,\u201D I told myself and slowly began\
  \ to slouch into the seat while a song in French played on the radio \u2013 something\
  \ about opening to the present moment. \n\nThe car ride felt like an eternity, mostly\
  \ due to the morning traffic as Parisians were on their way to work. Upon arriving\
  \ at my friend\u2019s home, I was greeted by Celine who rushed out the front door\
  \ and embraced me with open arms. I was instantly comforted by the smell of fresh\
  \ coffee on her clothes and the sweet perfume in her curly brown hair. It was this\
  \ same embrace that I felt six years ago when we met in San Francisco at Grace Cathedral\
  \ during Yoga on the Labryinth. The sight and smell of her was enough to snap my\
  \ awareness into the present moment and the reality of where I was slowly began\
  \ to sink in. I took in the view of her neighborhood: the cobble stone roads and\
  \ alleys filled with people and kids walking to work and school, window balconies\
  \ decorated with miniature gardens of various colorful plants and flowers, and a\
  \ familiar sense of calm that I would not expect for such a large city. \n\nCeline\
  \ excitedly asked about my trip as she gave me a quick tour of her home and seamlessly\
  \ was able to inquisitively ask questions while also explaining the history of her\
  \ home and neighborhood. I put my things down and then we headed out towards Parc\
  \ des Buttes-Chaumont to find a caf\xE9 to sit and catch up. On our walk through\
  \ the park, the memory of my last therapy session came to the forefront of my mind,\
  \ slowly distracting me from the beautiful scenery of the park. I remembered that\
  \ my therapist was guiding me through a visualization of finding a \u201Csafe place,\u201D\
  \ somewhere I could retreat to when things became challenging or I was emotionally\
  \ overwhelmed. In the vision, I remember seeing myself surrounded by grass covered\
  \ hills with a weeping willow standing amongst it. I saw myself sitting underneath\
  \ the tree, feeling the protection of its shade and the comfort of the wind and\
  \ I sensed a feeling peace. The memory was so strong that I felt the need to share\
  \ it with Celine and as I began to tell the story, I was stopped in my tracks by\
  \ the view in front of us. I was looking at a part of the park where grass covered\
  \ hills surrounded the terrain and right in the middle stood a weeping willow tree.\
  \ Its branches and leaves waving in the wind, summoning me to sit underneath it.\
  \ Then the word \u201CHome\u201D came to mind. I had come home."
