Text: 'This story would be one of exploration by the seat of your pants.  Going somewhere
  with few reservations and interacting with people, both in hostels and the locals
  in home stays.  I have been to Lisbon and Oporto previously..but in 1990.  The contrasts
  between then and now would highlight the story with the old and the new. Made it
  all the way up to Bragancia in the mountains last time.  Like the off the beaten
  path stuff and would strive to go solo for more interaction with the local populace.  I
  would hope to inspire older folks to just go out and do it as life is short...so
  what are they waiting for?  My fiancee passed away in 2004 from breast cancer, she
  was ten years younger than I so ever since then I''ve traveled a couple to a few
  months every year.

  Not trying to go for the easy way here...just thought you may wish to take a look
  at the last couple of years of writing...with photos.


  Thanks for your time


  Kevco'
