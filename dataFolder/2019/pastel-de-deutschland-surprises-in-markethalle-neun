Text: "Markethalle Neun in Berlin is nestled among the businesses in Kreuzberg's Eisenbahnstra\xDF\
  e and has been operating in various forms since the late 19th century. Despite having\
  \ been open in its current form since 2011, it only popped onto my radar after my\
  \ father suggested visiting, it having been recommended to him by a work colleague.\
  \ The idea certainly excited me; recent years have seen Berlin become a rising star\
  \ on the world culinary scene. But for me what brought intrigue also posed risks\
  \ that any allergic foodie will know, especially in a nation where I didn't speak\
  \ much of the language. Nevertheless, with a phrasebook in hand and \"Ich bin allergisch\
  \ gegen\" typed into my phone, I set off to see if I could find allergy-friendly\
  \ food in Berlin. Little did I know I was in for a highly unexpected culinary surprise.\n\
  \nWalking into the market, a short hop from Berlin's city centre, one can feel the\
  \ energy of the place, so many stalls laden with food and drink from all over the\
  \ city and the world. One stall, in particular, caught my eye, a little cart standing\
  \ alone in one of the market's communal areas. This cart was laden with all manner\
  \ of Portuguese pastry delights, with the world-famous Past\xE9is de Nata taking\
  \ pride of place on the stall. Just as I was about to discount this stall as an\
  \ egg-filled allergy nightmare, something caught my eye. One of the labels was proudly\
  \ displaying the name Pastel de Nada, amused by the wordplay I looked closer and\
  \ saw to my delight the word \"vegan\" in the corner of the label. I was hardly\
  \ able to contain my joy, this was something I'd searched for since visiting Portugal\
  \ two summers ago. \n\nWhilst paying for the tasty treat, I struck up a conversation\
  \ with the lady running the stall, a bubbly Portuguese woman called Mafalda who\
  \ explained some of the stall's history to me. Since opening in 2006, the company\
  \ that runs the cart, alongside several other Berlin businesses had the simple aim\
  \ of making Portuguese food available for all. With that in mind, I asked Mafalda\
  \ why the company had decided to stock vegan Pastel de Nata. Her response was simple,\
  \ \"it is such a special cake that people deserve a vegan one\" In a world where\
  \ alternative dietary choices can make life very difficult, this determination to\
  \ make one simple thing accessible to all was heartwarming. The Nata itself was\
  \ gorgeous, a rich and tasty custard surrounded by soft and flaky pastry. It tasted\
  \ especially good knowing someone had created it with the aim of making an iconic\
  \ dish accessible to all. \n\nFinding Pastel de Nata so far away from their Iberian\
  \ homeland was something I never expected; finding allergy-friendly ones was even\
  \ more of a surprise. I didn't expect to discover these in Berlin and I can only\
  \ hope that their homeland follows suit with allergy-friendly options of their own.\
  \ Until two days before the trip, the name was unknown to me, now it's a place I\
  \ won't forget, full of excitement and unexpected surprises."
