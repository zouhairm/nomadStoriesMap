Text: "Imagine a country in which you\u2019ve never been. Imagine you wish to discover\
  \ it and imagine you have a flight in few hours for coming back home. Imagine that\
  \ you were there for another reason and not just to visit the beautiful places this\
  \ country can offer.\nImagine that it\u2019s raining.\nImagine that you don\u2019\
  t stop and you decide to go to the closest waterfall. \n\nAlone, wet and full of\
  \ energies. \n\nAfter a short trip in the bus, you can hear the water falling impetuously\
  \ close to you. You start walking and the noise is always louder. A nice dog walks\
  \ close to you and when you throw the stick he plays with you. \n\n\nA little bit\
  \ of rain and a little bit of steps and you get the place. You see it, the waterfall.\
  \ You observe it close to the sea and you think of the vastness of the world. How\
  \ can nature never stop? Where does it find so much of energy? Why does not it get\
  \ tired? \n\nLooking at it, you\u2019re amazed. The world, the nature is simply\
  \ incredible. I didn\u2019t expect to find these emotions inside myself. I thought\
  \ I would have said just: \u201CThis is beautiful\u201D. Actually, this is something\
  \ more. This is something which can go ahead forever and forever, despite obstacles,\
  \ despite scaries, despite bad news.\n\nSometimes I have thought that travelling\
  \ allows you to find yourself and to give you the answers you need. Human brain\
  \ is not able to remember every single element of the reality, but emotions can\
  \ change you forever telling you how to continue your life. Emotions are found where\
  \ you feel well and there is not a better way to feel well than looking at something\
  \ beautiful. \n\nI saw that waterfall and I felt well.\n\nAnother are just for a\
  \ while. Time goes and you must go and follow your way.\n\nThis is why you go looking\
  \ for a simple bar for drinking a coffee. You don\u2019t find any place, but then\
  \ you get closer to a sketchy place. You want a coffee and so you get inside anyway.\n\
  \nTwo men are standing inside and you ask for a coffee. They answer: \u201CPlease,\
  \ sit down\u201D. \n\nYou sit down.\n\nThe coffee comes relatively fast in a very\
  \ typical cup. You drink it and the man who prepared the coffee asks you why you\
  \ are there, what do you do in your life and if you like the country. \n\nYou answer\
  \ and then you reply with similar questions. \n\u201CI am a refugee from Iran. Do\
  \ you know my country?\u201D\n\u201CYes! And do you like this new place?\u201D\n\
  \u201CYes...Mmmm...Yes...Yes...Mmmm...Yes\u201D\nI didn\u2019t expect to find a\
  \ man older than me being confused about his present. Does it mean that even if\
  \ you are not twenty years old you can be not totally satisfied of your life?\n\
  I didn\u2019t expect to find a man older than me that is still dreaming with energy.\n\
  \nTime goes again and I need to come back to the hotel. I greet them and I go to\
  \ the bus stop. In the while a colorful cat asks me food with tendress and meowings.\
  \ I give him a piece of biscuit and I definitely take my way.\n\nBefore getting\
  \ the hotel, you need to buy some gifts. You walk for a while under the rain and\
  \ you get inside a shop.\n\n\u201CIs this plate typical of this country?\u201D\n\
  \u201CYes, yes. Everything is from this country, except me\u201D.\nI didn\u2019\
  t expect to find a young person available to share with me a part of his story with\
  \ me in that situation.\nHe explains to me that he is a Syrian refugee. He is living\
  \ in a dignified way, working and dreaming. He\u2019s worried because his brother\
  \ is in Germany and maybe they will never meet again because of documents.\nLet\
  \ me say that it\u2019s strange to feel so privileged just because you were born\
  \ in Europe. I will meet my brother again.\n\nYou wish him good luck. \n\nThe rain\
  \ has stopped and you\u2019re coming back home. \n\nNow I repeat to myself that\
  \ world is beautiful and that humans are just a part of it."
