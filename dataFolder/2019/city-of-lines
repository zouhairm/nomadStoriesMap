Text: "They don\u2019t list the Paris Uniform in the travel guides, but it should\
  \ be there, in between the H\xF4tel de Ville and the Hunchback of Notre-Dame: How\
  \ To Dress The Part And Avoid Stigma. Paris\u2019 everyday fashion requirements\
  \ are as narrow as her stairwells: jeans, white sneakers, leather jacket optional.\
  \  I arrived in April to find ninety percent of my suitcase redundant.\n\nIt took\
  \ me a long time to work out why I could tell the visitors from the locals even\
  \ if the tourists, like me, were wearing the uniform. But it\u2019s oh so possible\
  \ to get it wrong: running shoes instead of casual sneakers, ill-fitting jeans,\
  \ polo shirts. A lot of exposed skin that is not smooth and luminous. \n\nLittle\
  \ wonder, though, that a city so physically dominated by lines tends sartorially\
  \ to colour inside them.\n\nThe grandest line is the Axe historique, which since\
  \ the 17th Century has been Paris\u2019 spine and today marches unbent from the\
  \ Louvre, through the Jardin des Tuileries, across the Place de la Concorde, along\
  \ the Avenues of the Champs-Elys\xE9es, the Grande Arm\xE9e, and Charles de Gaulle\
  \ (passing under the Arc de Triomphe on the way), and finally over the Seine to\
  \ the modern Grande Arche in the business district of La Defense. Crossing this\
  \ triumphal way on a clear day is an exercise in awe and timing: the perfect linear\
  \ grandeur of the thoroughfares between monuments demands to be admired, while traffic\
  \ charges on, willing to run down the mesmerised pedestrian.\n\nIf Louis XIV and\
  \ Napoleon laid the foundations with the Voie Triomphale, it was Georges-Eugene\
  \ Haussmann\u2019s renovation of Paris in the 1800s that turned her into the City\
  \ of Lines. Haussmann\u2019s ambitious project of demolition and creation intended\
  \ to make a grim urban landscape more spacious, interconnected and beautiful. Today\
  \ it is impossible to imagine Paris without the symmetry of the Rue de Rivoli, or\
  \ the Boulevard Voltaire.\n\nI have a theory that it\u2019s the lines that have\
  \ made Paris such a haven for artists. What better place for the beauty-obsessed\
  \ and the subversive than a city defined by lines demanding to be either admired\
  \ or transgressed?\n\nParis is an immersive masterclass in perspective and light,\
  \ its avenues lined by stone buildings dressed in much the same style as the modern\
  \ Parisian woman: slight variations on an elegant theme. (While their balconies\
  \ and turrets and windows are rarely uniform, Haussmanian buildings never exceed\
  \ six storeys and their height is, or at least once was, proportional to the width\
  \ of the street at their feet).\n\nWhat the lines mean, in practice, is that in\
  \ almost every neighbourhood there\u2019s an elegantly framed and often unexpected\
  \ view of something. Round a corner in Grands Boulevards and you\u2019re face to\
  \ face with the domes of Sacre-C\u0153ur; turn your back for a moment on the Pantheon\
  \ and the Eiffel Tower peers over the Jardin de Luxembourg. \n\nHaussmann would\
  \ perhaps be disappointed to discover that the line which most powerfully defines\
  \ modern Paris, both physically and culturally, is its least beautiful. The Boulevard\
  \ P\xE9riph\xE9rique draws a shaky circle along the city\u2019s administrative limits,\
  \ separating the city from her suburbs with absolute authority. \n\nThe not-Paris\
  \ beyond the P\xE9riph\xE9rique is more diverse; cross the physical boundary of\
  \ Paris and you\u2019re more likely to transgress her intangible limits. The word\
  \ banlieue has become weighted with poverty and racial tension, insecurity and ugliness.\n\
  \nBut the banlieues range from desperation to decadence; from the \u201Chot\u201D\
  \ neighbourhood of Saint-Ouen in the north-west, it\u2019s a short drive to La Defense,\
  \ all glass towers and global insurance firms. Venture south-west and the suburbs\
  \ are village-pretty, filled with detached houses, the smell of woodsmoke in winter,\
  \ the occasional lost hedgehog in summer.\n\nThe French Government \u2013 famous\
  \ for drawing incomprehensible bureaucratic lines around everything from employment\
  \ rights to handwriting \u2013 enjoys sending newcomers to the end of metro lines\
  \ in search of its elusive approval. In September I approach the P\xE9riph\xE9rique\
  \ to visit the Prefecture de Police, an application for a French driver\u2019s licence\
  \ in my hand. I\u2019m wearing my good sneakers and my leather jacket for the occasion.\
  \ Please, my dossier says in triplicate. I\u2019ll drive within your lines if you\u2019\
  ll let me."
