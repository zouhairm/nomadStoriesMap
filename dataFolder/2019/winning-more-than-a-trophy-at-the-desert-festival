Text: "My hands were on fire, the distorted rope seared into my sunburnt skin. Sweat\
  \ dripped from my face to mingle with the sand beneath my feet. The laboured breaths\
  \ of my comrades filled my ears. A combined pull. A fall. A hush. Then the crowds\
  \ went wild. \n\nWe made up only four of the thousands who were pouring into Jaisalmer\
  \ to take part in the annual three-day sporting event celebrating everything Rajasthani.\
  \ We would leave with an individual insight into Rajasthani culture, however we\
  \ came with singular minds: winning a trophy. \nWe careened into our first taste\
  \ of the festival, coming face to face with a distinguished figure garbed in white\
  \ linen and brandishing a sword on horseback. He led a crowd which was an explosion\
  \ of colour and music, comprised of women in rainbow saris astride camels and children\
  \ acting out popular Hindu myths. As commanding as the pied piper, they led us out\
  \ into the desert to await the coming games. \n\nSeated under large canopies to\
  \ block out the blazing sun, the atmosphere was like that of a football match without\
  \ any of the aggression. Everyone makes room for one another as we sign up for our\
  \ event. Water is passed, jalebis are devoured, and we do anything but settle down\
  \ to watch the first competition: turban tying. A hilarious exercise in which men\
  \ not native to India are tasked with tying their own turbans after being given\
  \ meters of cloth and a brief demonstration. This was made more entertaining by\
  \ comparison, the ensuing Rajasthani equivalent taking merely seconds to secure\
  \ the elaborate constructions. \n\nThen came the \u2018Mr Desert\u2019 competition.\
  \ Part beauty pageant-part strongman contest, men proudly approached the stage.\
  \ Each was dressed magnificently, amazingly structured moustaches peeking out from\
  \ underneath towering turbans. The grading process was exact with the length of\
  \ nose and shape of eyes all considered when deliberating over the perfect Rajasthani\
  \ male. We were to learn later that the title holds real gravitas, our subsequent\
  \ desert excursion was sold to us on the basis that our guide\u2019s grandfather\
  \ had once himself been a Mr. Desert. \n\nThe ensuing camel polo consisted of the\
  \ creatures getting caught up in their own legs, causing them and their riders to\
  \ come crashing down in search for the tiny ball. They fared no more gracefully\
  \ in the races, kicking up clouds of sand as they hurtled around, their fearless\
  \ riders dexterously holding on. \nWe waited in anticipation for our event to be\
  \ called. Eventually it came: international women\u2019s tug of war. The Indian\
  \ component was already up, dressed in matching t-shirts and caps; they looked intimidatingly\
  \ legitimate. Under the desert sun with sand whipping around our faces we emerged\
  \ bewildered but somehow victorious. We erupted into celebration, music pounded,\
  \ and we were swarmed by tv crews proffering microphones and asking, \u201Chow do\
  \ you feel?\u201D After a brief pause, I choked out: \u201Clike Usain Bolt?\u201D\
  . \n\nAfter a glorious procession in which crackly speakers emitted the nationality\
  \ of each participant we were awarded with a gigantic golden trophy. Lifting it\
  \ above my head we posed for multiple photoshoots, acting progressively more ridiculous\
  \ for the amusement of the crowd.  \n\nFor the rest of the day we were treated like\
  \ minor celebrities, numerous TV interviews allowed me to make up for my Usain Bolt\
  \ comment and we were posed meatier questions like \u201Chow do you feel being British\
  \ in India?\u201D Through chatting to decidedly more talented contestants we learnt\
  \ the religious significance of the festival and meeting past winners helped us\
  \ see how the festival had developed. By participating we had managed to break a\
  \ barrier between tourist and local, by becoming more than spectators we had shown\
  \ we were willing to learn about and embrace this amazing exhibition. \n \nPost\
  \ camel ride later that night, sleeping under the desert stars with a thali cooked\
  \ over a campfire warming my stomach, I couldn\u2019t wait for the next day\u2019\
  s festivities and the promised ensuing pandemonium. For the next two months the\
  \ trophy would take up valuable space in my backpack. However, it never stopped\
  \ sparking interesting conversations whenever humbly displayed."
