Text: "**Let the sea writes about the sea, and reminds you of the sea**\n\nThe phrase\
  \ \"Khaled La Bahr, a.k.a: The Sea\" from Morocco said when I called to ask him\
  \ to remind me what happened at the sea in the city of Hammamet \"Tunisia\" at night\
  \ on December 25, 2017.\nWhy does my memory betrays me about this event? All I remember\
  \ that I was happy.\nThe strangest thing is that everyone who was with us did not\
  \ remember anything about it too.\nWhy am I so sure that you are the only one who\
  \ knows the events of this day and remembers it, and why you?\nMy call to \"Khaled\"\
  \ came upon the request of the psychiatrist who gives me depression and psychological\
  \ trauma therapy after the death of my mother, by recalling the moments and happy\
  \ memories in my life and writing it down , suddenly i remembered my trip to \"\
  Tunisia\" and how happy I was!\nWhile writing about my trip to Tunisia, I remembered\
  \ happy events and useful experiences, but one day in my memory was vague and unclear.\
  \ I can not clearly recall those memories about the sea in the city of Hammamet,\
  \ Tunisia. I feel that I touched the hands of the sky and my heart was full of happiness.\
  \ \n\nI got insomnia, my pen stopped, and also my life and my main concern became\
  \ how to remember this day... I called Khaled and asked him.. He told me that he\
  \ will write me a letter about that night.\nHe said jokingly: - \"Call the sea to\
  \ write about the sea and remind you of the sea.\"\nI was selected to travel to\
  \ attend a conference in the civil society to the city of Hammamat in Tunisia.\n\
  When I arrived at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Hammamet, i was greeted by the responsible\
  \ for the program and training participants from the various countries (Khaled Labahr\
  \ from Morocco). A man totally different from me. Very quite, speaks few words,\
  \ and has a freezing glacier face. I am not a smooth person to approach people.\
  \ I am waiting for them to take the first step so that they do not hurt me. So it\
  \ was certain that I will not be friend with him, me and \"Khalid\" will never do\
  \ any project in the future, even i will not remember him when I return back to\
  \ Egypt.\nKhalid told us that all the participants were invited to dinner outside\
  \ the hotel but did not attend with us because he was busy preparing the conference\
  \ program. We arrived at the restaurant for dinner, I was shocked! The place does\
  \ not reflect the heritage of \"Tunisia\".\nThe gathering ended without asking myself\
  \ a dinner. Everyone came out of the restaurant, but I do not know what happened.\
  \ I found myself alone in the street. No one with me, then i tried to return to\
  \ the restaurant in case I can find any colleagues looking for me, and I worried\
  \ that in Tunisia, the majority of the shops close down early and it became more\
  \ catastrophic that I have no money from the country's currency. I could take a\
  \ taxi, I had only a few dollars to be paid for visa issuance expenses. Even the\
  \ mobile I can not use, because the battary was empty. \n\nYes,it became even worse\
  \ than that when i failed in remembering the name of the hotel. I was tried from\
  \ long walking but suddenly I found three people including a girl, i approached\
  \ them and asked them about the road, they noticed that I was tense, someone asked\
  \ me you are Egyptian ?! I replied Yes! He said that if I were not Egyptian and\
  \ from another country (which he hates), he would not help me (that country is associated\
  \ with \"Tunisia\" as political problems and as usual people pay the price of that\
  \ policy and hate and love each other according to the whims of the rulers)\n\n\
  Finally, we found the hotel and I at the gate of the hotel found in front of me\
  \ \"Khaled-the sea\" and the features of his face do not explain anything and he\
  \ looks angry,"
