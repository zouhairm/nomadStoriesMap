Text: "It was a day like no other, the breeze was warm and the sun was high in the\
  \ sky and the waves were gently caressing he sandy shore. We set out into the depths\
  \ of the horizon on a little boat in search of an experience. We wanted to feed\
  \ the village that day with the fruits of our labour. \nWe got to a spot that felt\
  \ right. The sun was hot and the ocean calm. This was it. The spot dreams are made\
  \ of. The gods of the ocean must have been with us that day because we managed to\
  \ catch 2 giant Wahoo fish. They were beautiful. Like no other fish I had ever seen,\
  \ they had Stripes like a tiger and faugh just as hard as one as we tried to bring\
  \ it in the boat. The fisherman Screamed and shouted wahoo wahoo. All of a sudden\
  \ we were all chanting WAHOO WAHOO. The smiles went from ear to ear. Songs started\
  \ to be sang and dancing broke out. \nSitting back watching the pure joy on the\
  \ fisherman\u2019s faces was everything we had set out for that day. As we headed\
  \ back to shore there was a sense of satisfaction in our hearts. Everyone seemed\
  \ more happy knowing they were getting to eat a feast tonight. Upon returning to\
  \ shore we were greated by the owner of a local restaurant called cleavlands. It\
  \ sat right on the beach with a picture perfect view of what we call paradise. \
  \ \nCleavland himself greated us upon arrival. You could see his white teeth beaming\
  \ with excitement that he was going to be able to cook a feast for the small village.\
  \ WAHOO WAHOO they chanted as they lifted the enormous fish from the boat. There\
  \ were people thanking the high heavens and children dancing around us. The feeling\
  \ of pure blissfullness overcame us till tears of joy rolled down our faces. The\
  \ fish was carried like a trophy over head to the kitchen where it was blessed.\
  \ Cleavland insisted we grab a drink and enjoy some local music while he prepares\
  \ us lunch. We sat with our feet in the sand, the sun on our faces and the calming\
  \ sound of the palm leaves rustling over our heads. Life was and is great. All of\
  \ a sudden it hit us. The overwhelming scent of the fresh fish and local spices\
  \ combined was intoxicating. We headed up to the deck where people were laughing\
  \ and dancing. Every minute of life was being enjoyed to the fullest. It was impossible\
  \ not to smile. Finally the long awaited wahoo was presented in front of us. It\
  \ sat on a bed of long grain rice along side some saut\xE9 cabbage with a perfectly\
  \ cut lemon wedge. It was heaven on a plate. Everyone sat and prayed to the fish,\
  \ they thanked it for its life before they dug in. Wow the flavour was something\
  \ I will never forget. The flesh of the fish was bright white, it flaked apart as\
  \ soon as you touched it. As we sat around the table listening to local fishing\
  \ stories we became as one. We were now part of their stories that will never be\
  \ forgotten. We will foreve just like they will remember that perfect day where\
  \ the breeze was warm and the sun was high in the sky and the waves gently caressed\
  \ the sandy shore."
