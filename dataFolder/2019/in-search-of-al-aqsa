Text: "I jumped the fence although I knew I shouldn\u2019t. It was just a few mental\
  \ bars that doubled as handles for the people walking down the ramp towards the\
  \ main road, but it created a division nonetheless, and those things mattered here.\
  \ \n\nHad I been anywhere else in the world I doubt I would have seemed or felt\
  \ like much of a threat. Clearly, I wasn\u2019t very good at climbing or at being\
  \ discreet about my sudden rebellion. I clumsily stumbled as I landed and then just\
  \ stood there re-adjusting my clothes as the people in the restaurant below looked\
  \ up at me. They didn\u2019t seem very frightened.\n\nI sat on the roof of the restaurant\
  \ overlooking Jerusalem as the sun set over the newer, more modern buildings. Sitting\
  \ there felt deceptively peaceful. In half an hour my bus would come and take me\
  \ and the rest of my group back to the West Bank where the occupation felt much\
  \ more brutal. This might be the last moment of quiet I would get for some time,\
  \ so I began writing about my attempts to reach Al-Aqsa Mosque, the sacred place\
  \ where Prophet Mohammed (pbuh) is said to have ascended to heaven. \n\nWhen we\
  \ were dropped off in old Jerusalem we were warned to stay in groups for our safety\
  \ and informed that the mosque would be closed to non-Muslims at that time of the\
  \ day. I protested that it was the only chance we had, but, unfortunately, the whole\
  \ territory doesn\u2019t change according to my wishes. If only. \n\nSo, of course,\
  \ I set out to get in anyways. I had been mistaken for that of an Arab before, so\
  \ why shouldn\u2019t it be so now? I wrapped my scarf loosely over my head as we\
  \ entered the old city. Then, as the rest of my group, mostly pale and blonde Europeans,\
  \ walked down past the crowded shops in the tiny narrow streets of the old town,\
  \ I turned right and lost them. \n\nI found a few signs and followed them eagerly\
  \ up and down the allies until I arrived in what is known as the Muslim neighbourhood,\
  \ where the Palestinians are still allowed to be. Here, the shops were vibrant,\
  \ full of spices and beautiful fabrics, but the atmosphere was tense. The Israeli\
  \ soldiers\u2019 presence was more visible and suddenly looking like an Arab did\
  \ not feel so safe. \n\nI felt the soldiers\u2019 gaze fixed on my back as their\
  \ hands held on tightly to their guns. I hesitated but fear got the best of me.\
  \ Gently, I loosened my scarf to reveal my hair once again and as their eyes seemed\
  \ to move away from me, my actions were a painful reminder of my privilege as an\
  \ outsider. \n\nWhen I reached the place where the entry to the mosque should be,\
  \ I found a group of soldiers standing next to a fence instead. The road split in\
  \ two and I reluctantly asked one of them in English the direction to the mosque.\
  \ He laughed and turned his body left, signalling the way to the mosque with his\
  \ rifle. I began to head that way, but he stopped me. \u2018You can\u2019t go\u2019\
  \ he said, cheerfully. \u2018Why not?\u2019 I asked, feeling much more tense that\
  \ he seemed to feel. \u2018Are you Muslim?\u2019 He asked, having already decided\
  \ the answer. \u2018I could be\u2019, I answered. \u2018No, you don\u2019t want\
  \ to be.\u2019 He said, more solemnly now. \n\nWhat he meant was that I didn\u2019\
  t want to be a Palestinian. I turned around disappointed and after doing some shopping\
  \ in a few Palestinian shops and witnessing a couple of kids taken aside and questioned,\
  \ I made my way towards the meeting point, stopping at the spot where I know sat\
  \ gathering my thoughts.\n\nWhen I jumped the fence, nothing happened. I did not\
  \ get arrested. I did not get shot. I could have been. Many have been. But I was\
  \ not Palestinian and that was a kind of privilege I embodied."
