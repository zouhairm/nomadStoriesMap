Text: "It had been a varied and highly rewarding first trip to Indonesia, taking in\
  \ the volcanoes of Berastagi, the natural beauty of Lake Toba and the highlight\
  \ - seeing the endangered Sumatran orangutan in the jungles of Bukit Lawang. However,\
  \ after ten days of exploring Sumatra, it was time to make my way to Medan, the\
  \ island's largest city, in order to catch my flight back to Kuala Lumpur early\
  \ the next morning.\n\nAs the only foreigner sitting in a food court that evening,\
  \ five young Indonesian guys grabbed my attention and motioned for me to join them.\
  \ I finished my meal, walked across the plaza and sat with them, quickly discovering\
  \ that they barely had a word of English between them. Unfortunately, my Bahasa\
  \ was even more limited, but as is so often the case when you're travelling, we\
  \ managed to get through the language barrier and they suggested that we all go\
  \ for a beer.\n\nI have to admit that my first reaction to their offer was one of\
  \ hesitation, but my curiosity definitely got the better of me - being in a predominantly\
  \ Islamic country, going for a beer with some locals was the last thing I expected\
  \ to do on my last night! I assured myself that everything would be fine and we\
  \ were soon flying through the streets of Medan, three motorbikes between the six\
  \ of us, with the \u2018leader\u2019 of the group pointing out sights to me along\
  \ the way. \n\nI was reminded of my initial uncertainty when we suddenly turned\
  \ down a dark side street after about ten minutes, but rather than worry, I found\
  \ myself shaking my head in amusement at how stupid I\u2019d been to go with them.\
  \ What was that point about not accepting lifts from strangers that everyone's parents\
  \ used to harp on about?\n\nWe continued down the back alley and I racked my brains\
  \ about how I was going to get myself out of the situation, even considering jumping\
  \ off the motorbike as we started to slow down. A small restaurant came into view\
  \ and my angst turned to confusion - what were we doing here? Fortunately, I needn\u2019\
  t have worried, the restaurant was owned by the leader's family and they just wanted\
  \ everyone to meet their Australian friend!\n\nAfter five minutes and ten times\
  \ as many handshakes, we took off once again. I bought some beers to take to the\
  \ \u2018nightclub\u2019, which consisted of plastic tables and chairs on the side\
  \ of the street. There were several of these establishments next to one another\
  \ and the sound bleed from the ridiculous levels of techno being blasted from each\
  \ of them meant that the music was indistinguishable. If conversations in the food\
  \ court were difficult, now they were impossible!\n\nMy flight was at 6am, so I\
  \ had earlier tried to explain that I needed to be back by around 2am to pack my\
  \ things and make my way to the airport. I had left my phone behind, so had no way\
  \ of telling what time it was and wasn\u2019t sure whether they had understood my\
  \ request, but after a few beers and plenty of people watching, the guys signalled\
  \ that it was time to go.\n\nAnother motorbike trip through the city followed before\
  \ I finally recognised my guesthouse. I got off the leader's motorbike and he showed\
  \ me his watch \u2013 2am on the dot! I shook my head in amusement for the umpteenth\
  \ time that night and thanked my new mates for showing me around their city.\n\n\
  I\u2019m sure I would have been a lot fresher for my flight and the following day\
  \ in Kuala Lumpur had I not taken a leap into the unknown, but I don\u2019t think\
  \ it would have been quite as memorable!"
