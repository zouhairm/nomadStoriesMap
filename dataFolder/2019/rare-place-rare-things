Text: "I have always been a fan of artefacts and antique things. And\_Jaisalmer\_\
  is filled with antique shops, that sell very rare things may that be a fish-shaped\
  \ lock which fascinated me every time I saw it, or may it be very cute and complex\
  \ looking toy for kids. I used to stop at every antique and artefact shop on my\
  \ way to anywhere I go. It was like they had\_a magical power that pulled me towards\
  \ them and I couldn\u2019t resist it.  And there was this shop in particular where\
  \ I used to stop everyday and look for something interesting in that slot to take\
  \ it with me, but there were so many things that I could never decide what to buy.\
  \ It had been 3 days that I used to regularly come to the shop look for something\
  \ rare and return to my room without anything but on the last day I was sure I want\
  \ to but something to gift my brother for good luck, so I examined almost every\
  \ thing kept on that table, and the shopkeeper uncle who now knew us as we have\
  \ been there everyday and used to talk to him about what the different artefacts\
  \ meant to do. He told me to buy a fish-shaped lock that I have eyed from day one,\
  \ but I gave him a reason that the day I would have my own my place I would be buying\
  \ interiors from him and this answer made him happy.  Then there was a shop that\
  \ I could never forget, it had statues of gods of different ethnic groups and it\
  \ brought out the explorer part of me which wanted to ask questions about who these\
  \ gods were, which were the ethnic groups and people who worshiped them, why were\
  \ they worshiped and what not. But there was no one that could answer these questions,\
  \ so I left the shop with a lot of questions and a lot of pictures of the statues\
  \ hoping that one day I will meet people and show them these pictures telling them\
  \ about the things I discovered while on the various adventures and be happy with\
  \ the mysteries that remained with this statues."
