Text: "After my uncle has put a lot of effort into researching our family tree, I\
  \ have known my great great grandmother was a dancer at the legendary Moulin Rouge,\
  \ the talk-of-town-place in Paris' wild nightlife during the Belle Epoque.\nBeing\
  \ a musician / singer-songwriter myself and being surrounded by family with regular\
  \ 9 to 5 jobs, I fell in love with the fact there was this one woman in my bloodline\
  \ that once shared the same passion for the arts and music with me and was even\
  \ friends with some of the most iconic artists at the time, like Henri Toulouse-Lautrec.\
  \ Ever since my family has known about her existence on that faithful Christmas\
  \ Day in 2013, this connection to her has sticked with me like.\n\nAfter finishing\
  \ our a-levels in 2015, my friend Lisa and I decided to celebrate our upcoming graduation\
  \ with a nice little trip to Paris.\nOn a gloomy afternoon, we walked around the\
  \ mysterious streets of Montmartre and by accident came across the cemetery. \n\
  Strolling around the venerable graves with famous names I couldn't believe my own\
  \ eyes: \"Ici repose Louise Weber, dite \"La Goulue\", 1866-1929\". \nHave I just\
  \ stumbled across my own relatives grave by accident? I sure did. I was speechless.\
  \ \n\nSince then, I have returned twice, with yellow marguerites."
