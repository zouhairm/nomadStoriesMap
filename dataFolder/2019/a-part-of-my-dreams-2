Text: "Why I LOVE FRANCE...?\nMost people know that France is one of the romantic\
  \ countries in the world. some places have  beautiful architecture in the West European\
  \ region whose high art and magnificent. spread of the light from thousands of lights\
  \ at night makes it even more dazzling. Visiting Paris is like a dream of many people.\n\
  I'd like to visit the cultural capital of western France, Nantes...you know why?\
  \ because  the gateway to the Loire Valley comes alive in summer with a multitude\
  \ of events. \nAnd as Brittany's capital is a cultural center, a beautiful historical\
  \ city, and well within range of the province's gorgeous coastline. Add in family\
  \ attractions and superb food, and you can't go wrong with a visit to Nantes. \n\
  The food scene also blossoms in warmer months, with the emergence of La Cantine\
  \ du Voyage , a pop-up restaurant on Ile de Nantes ... where diners can sample a\
  \ set lunch or dinner beside the water with wine .\nYou can\u2019t get lost, and\
  \ there\u2019s always \nsomething beautiful around the next corner\U0001F609\nNo\
  \ doubt, I did make an extraordinary trip in France and enjoy the unique combination\
  \ of beautiful architecture, unspoilled  history, local people, delicious cuisine\
  \ and delicious wines of course\U0001F601 surrounded by passionated and friendly\
  \ locals ... hmm , I don't think about \"falling\" in love for the local before.\
  \ Finally, it was happens and ends with tears......."
