Text: "\u201CSo, are you going to have to wear a burka while you\u2019re there?\u201D\
  \ \n\nI got this question over and over from other Americans when I told them I\
  \ was moving to the United Arab Emirates after my college graduation.\n\nUsually,\
  \ I laughed it off. No, I wouldn\u2019t be forced to wear the traditional full-body\
  \ covering, or even a head scarf, during my teaching contract in Abu Dhabi. Although\
  \ the country has a Muslim culture and population, westerners who live and work\
  \ there are free to dress as they please. \n\nI spent two years teaching preschool\
  \ in the capital city of the UAE. I was thrown into the deep end with a few short\
  \ weeks of training and then I found myself running a classroom overcrowded with\
  \ three and four-year-old students. Although, in my first year the term \u201Crunning\u201D\
  \ doesn\u2019t quite fit. Something like \u201Cflailing\u201D or \u201Cfalling\u201D\
  \ might be a better description. \n\nAs difficult as adjusting to life inside the\
  \ classroom was, adapting to life outside of work in Abu Dhabi was even tougher.\
  \ It was the first time I came in contact with women whose lifestyles were so foreign\
  \ to my own and I underestimated just how hard I would cling to my comfort zone\
  \ when confronted with the cultural practices that shape our lives into very different\
  \ molds.\n\n\nBecause my students were so young, they had to be picked up from my\
  \ classroom at the end of the day. Through this I met many of their parents, and\
  \ one mother in particular stood out from the rest. She was the only woman who arrived\
  \ every day in a complete burka. Even her eyes were obscured by the black cloth\
  \ and she wore black gloves to cover her hands.\n\nOver the course of the year,\
  \ I found myself increasingly fascinated with the woman behind the veil. How old\
  \ was she? What did she look like? What was her day-to-day life like inside her\
  \ home? \n\nI saw her every single day, but her silence and stature intimidated\
  \ me. Were we really so different that we couldn\u2019t find any common ground between\
  \ us, or is that just what I let myself believe?\n\nI\u2019ll never know, because\
  \ I chose the easy route. I gave her a small wave from across the room every day\
  \ when she came to collect her daughter, and never worked up the courage to start\
  \ a conversation. \n\n\nSometimes I was only an observer while life in the UAE swirled\
  \ on around me. Other times I found myself stumbling right up against it.\n\nWhen\
  \ I started my second year in Abu Dhabi I began tutoring a set of twins in their\
  \ house. After a few months, I was introduced to their father. Instinctively, I\
  \ reached out to shake his hand, but he gently rebuffed me by placing his own hand\
  \ on his chest. \n\nI flushed. \n\nI forgot; we weren\u2019t allowed to touch. \n\
  \nSome men believe they can\u2019t touch women they\u2019re not related to, to avoid\
  \ temptation. I smiled reflexively, but in that moment I felt small, seen not as\
  \ a person or a teacher but instead reduced down solely to my gender. \n\nI went\
  \ back to my lesson, but the feeling lingered. \n\nIn a t-shirt, jeans, and messy\
  \ bun, I was awkwardly aware of my sexuality. I could have asked about the practice,\
  \ but I shied away from my discomfort and let what could have been an open conversation\
  \ end, again, in an abrupt pause. \n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to pass judgement in these\
  \ small moments. It\u2019s much more difficult to examine them. But, I\u2019m learning,\
  \ an integral part of traveling is looking closer at our differences no matter how\
  \ much I may prefer to gloss over them.\n\nAs my two years in Abu Dhabi drew to\
  \ a close, I found myself back at the same table with the twins, preparing them\
  \ for their upcoming final exams. \n\nTheir mother came home from a shopping trip\
  \ and I offered her a piece of the candy I brought for the boys. She politely refused,\
  \ telling me she would have her period during Ramadan so she had to fast before\
  \ the holiday began.\n\n\u201COh,\u201D I said, nodding along. \n\nAnd then, surprising\
  \ myself, I asked, \u201CWhy?\u201D"
