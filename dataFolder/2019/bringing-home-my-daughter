Text: "Old chewing gum still stuck at the side of my vans and I decided to travel\
  \ Shillong wearing only these pairs. Mom was displeased but, that was the whole\
  \ point why we were attending cherry blossom festival. The day I returned home from\
  \ Bangalore, was the day I met her, stepped on a chewing gum and movie like fell\
  \ in love with my daughter. Her existence was ego, dominance, disagreement, laughter\
  \ and pure love in itself; everybody had their pick.\n\nThe sun was warm though\
  \ it was November, we step inside polo ground, punctually, as mentioned on the brochure,\
  \ dust meagrely rolled around, many stalls were setting up. Prawns, crabs, pork\
  \ were stacked on sticks for barbecue, fascinating view, my expectation was mostly\
  \ of samosa, jalebi, pakora as an Indian. Immediately I clicked their pictures and\
  \ send it to my meat fanatic brother, who instantly regretted not joining us. Further\
  \ ahead, a stall for study in Japan was being set up, wondered if they would have\
  \ any idea how to get a double flowering cherry blossom tree sapling, mom insisted\
  \ to at least ask them, being judgemental I didn't, besides I had already asked\
  \ someone to ask the Japanese delegates. I needed, deliberately wanted for my kid.\
  \ \n\nA month back when I was conversing with Mr. Albert, one of the government\
  \ organiser of the festival, they were giving Prunus cerasoides, the only specie\
  \ available. Japanese embassy had taken initiative to co-organize with Shillong\
  \ government, a silver lining at midst of adversity, holding on to a small hope,\
  \ maybe I could get a little info about the tree specie I wanted, I promised to\
  \ attend the festival.   \n \nThey weren't commencing anytime soon so we decided\
  \ to exit and call our driver, Ricky who was showing us around. First we visited\
  \ Don Bosco museum, 7 floors of Meghalaya and North-East history was displayed.\
  \ At top, a skywalk which gives an entire view of Shillong and we could see the\
  \ Don Bosco school, which was constructed in 1950 by the first missionary John Bosco\
  \ to educate Khasi, Garo and Jaintia tribes. We were hungry so we asked him to drive\
  \ to pizza hut, on our way we asked whether he had his lunch or not, he immediately\
  \ said yes and told us to eat too. Unexpected answer left me dazed, whenever you\
  \ hire a car in india which is not a tourist car, you have to feed your driver,\
  \ put petrol, but here he was, driving us to a restaurant and didn't try to extort.\
  \ \n\nOnce we were done we headed to Ward's Lake and asked Ricky to join us for\
  \ a stroll, park was decorated with types of lights, beautiful fall cherry blossom\
  \ trees were surrounded by people taking photos, turnwise. Mom was busy talking\
  \ with my aunt walking ahead of us, both of us were having conversation he was telling\
  \ me about his family, I did too, not the part about my kid. Approximately 16 kg,\
  \ 5 months old rottweiler, my daughter, she taught me how love feels, what forgiveness\
  \ means and she didn't expect anything rather than to be feed on time, play along\
  \ and most importantly to love her. She was a blessing to us, suffering from distemper\
  \ like our old boy Saturn did, she breath her last after fighting hard for 22 days.\
  \ When we bid her farewell for the last time, I was determined to bring her back,\
  \ in the form of cherry blossom tree, the only thing resembling her happy personality,\
  \ and live many years more than me, nobody deserves to die young.\n\n The day for\
  \ our return had arrived and Mr.Albert was suppose to give me the sapling, he asked\
  \ me if I could come near Laitumkhrah school, didn't know where it was so he personally\
  \ delivered it to me. I was so thankful to him, to people we met on this journey,\
  \ their integrity help me heal, weird but true. Though he didn't get time to ask\
  \ about the other specie I was content with what I had in my hands. Saturn was coming\
  \ home after two years, soon Pluto will too. Just a bit of patience.\n\nP.S. : Next\
  \ destination Japan."
