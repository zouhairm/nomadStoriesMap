Text: "\u2018It looks just like in movies\u2019 I think, while I see a man through\
  \ the window, walking with a baguette under his arm. Every Oh la la! I hear, every\
  \ boulangerie I see, reminds me of all the movies and books I made myself desperately\
  \ ingest as part of my preparation to come here. So, why do I feel like an alien?\
  \ All the cultural references were supposed to make my feel home when I got here.\
  \ Why does the Tower - Eiffel Tower, as the driver highlights, since \u2018there\
  \ are many towers in Paris Mademoiselle\u2019 - looks like a hologram when I see\
  \ it for the first time? \n\nI get home - I still can\u2019t believe that this is\
  \ home now - and everything is so Frenchie! \u2018Oh la la\u2019 level of Frenchie.\
  \ I read everything I could about this race: how to introduce to French people,\
  \ how French people date, how French people eat, how to be polite to French people\u2026\
  \ but now I don\u2019t know what to tell them. They look annoyed all the time -touch\xE9\
  , le clich\xE9 est vrai!\u2019 By the way, the word clich\xE9 comes from the French-\
  \ even if they are eager to show me around. They\u2019re hard to read. Am I going\
  \ to be able to make any friends here? Am I going to find the husband that will\
  \ take me away from the tragedy of Venezuela? - Joke\u2026 kind of -. The truth\
  \ is that all those months I spent preparing, didn\u2019t do much to prepare me\
  \ for this. \n\nBecause this city is a metropolis, yes; you can hear people talking\
  \ in every language in the Oh-so-scary-metro-of-Paris, but Paris is France itself.\
  \ Any of the romanticisms, ideas and stereotypes prepared me for this strong Parisian\
  \ essence that goes beyond the movies. The Eiffel Tower has a power to make you\
  \ forget all of those scenes, post cards, pictures\u2026 and bring you to this moment;\
  \ it forces you to make your own picture, your own drawing, to write a couples of\
  \ lines in her honor. She loves being worshiped, maybe that\u2019s why there are\
  \ so many -insufficient- images of her. \n\nL\u2019arc du Triumph, Place de la Republique,\
  \ Invalides, La Bastille\u2026 all of them are exactly as I imagined, but not only\
  \ that. Paris has a way that I never saw before. Even now in the middle of my struggle\
  \ for not falling for her, I admire her just for making it this difficult. I never\
  \ thought I liked clich\xE9s.\n\n\u2018Guerra avisada no mata soldados\u2019 is\
  \ what my mom says when she warns me about something that turns out exactly as she\
  \ said. So, why am I losing this war? It was not really unknown when I got here,\
  \ it was not surprising, it was not unexpected. \n\nI tried to avoid the \u2018\
  leap into the unknown\u2019\u2026 Oh God I tried. Just because I didn\u2019t want\
  \ it: unknown may be exciting, but not when you want to make the unknown become\
  \ home for a while. To be a successful immigrant - or to try to be one - I had to\
  \ be prepared. And indeed, I was; I thought I could easily figure this city out,\
  \ figure these people out. I was prepared to take whatever I could from Paris -a\
  \ degree, a job, a scholarship- and then move on as I\u2019ve been doing for a while\
  \ now. What I didn't expect though was the meaning, the story and the justification\
  \ of those clich\xE9s I knew about. Because those meanings, stories and justifications\
  \ are the ones making me love -oh God, I\u2019m proposing- this City of Clich\xE9\
  s \u2013 did someone say lights? -. \n\nSometimes it doesn\u2019t have to be unknown\
  \ to be magical. Sometimes clich\xE9s are not bad - worship the Eiffel Tower can\
  \ be pretty amaizng - they are just what they are. Leaping into the unknown is cool,\
  \ but the surprise of what you thought you knew is even cooler. In any case, I\u2019\
  m keeping my eyes wide open for the next Parisian clich\xE9."
