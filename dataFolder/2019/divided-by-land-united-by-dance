Text: "I think the best part about travelling is the surprises that come your way.\
  \ You could have an itinerary decided with every hour of your trip planned, but\
  \ no matter how organised you are, there will always be something that will take\
  \ you off course. In the month of July, my family and I travelled to Uzbekistan.\
  \ We planned to visit three cities- Bukhara, Samarkand and the capital, Tashkent.\
  \ On the second day, after exploring the rustic town of Bukhara, in the evening\
  \ we travelled to Samarkand in a speedy and classy train called the Afrosiyob. We\
  \ checked into Regent Hotel, cleaned up and made our way to a local homestay, where\
  \ the host had invited us for dinner. After a local meal in an open patio, we returned\
  \ to our hotel, all but ready to collapse onto our beds. Up until this point, our\
  \ trip was going as planned. What happened next, however, was absolutely unexpected.\
  \ When we entered the lobby of Regent Hotel, we heard the muffled beat of an old\
  \ Bollywood song wafting through the air. In the next moment, a young Uzbek girl\
  \ stuck her head out of the hall room and through the gap in the door, we heard\
  \ the familiar lyrics of a popular Hindi song, Disco Dancer. The Uzbek girl began\
  \ waving her hands frantically, signalling us to come into the hall. We stood still,\
  \ feeling confused at first and then amused, as the girl finally stepped out of\
  \ the doorway, ran up to us and pulled us towards the music. Inside the hall, there\
  \ was a small table in the corner where an Uzbek boy was playing Bollywood dance\
  \ numbers from YouTube and in the centre of the room, there was a whole group of\
  \ Uzbeks swaying their hips to Indian music. On the very first day, our tour guide,\
  \ Fakruddin had told us that the people here were madly in love with Bollywood,\
  \ and as I stood in the small hall in Regent Hotel, I was certain that he was speaking\
  \ the truth. There was a crowd of boys and girls, both young and old, before my\
  \ eyes, raving to old Hindi classics that we listened to, back home, all the time.\
  \ When they approached us to dance with them, we hesitated, but their enthusiasm\
  \ was contagious and before we knew it, we were moving along to the beat and having\
  \ a wild time with a couple of strangers. That same night, something Fakruddin said\
  \ to us on our first day in Uzbekistan, rang in my mind. \u201CMountains may not\
  \ meet mountains, but human beings can always find a way to meet each other.\u201D\
  \ In the hall, there were people from Uzbekistan and people from India. Hindi was\
  \ being spoken, Russian was being spoken. Two different styles of dancing took place,\
  \ the songs from both countries were different, our clothes and the way we dressed\
  \ were different. Yet somehow, we connected. Somehow, we covered the gap between\
  \ us and none of our differences mattered. Our lands may have been miles and miles\
  \ apart from each other, but as we sang and danced and laughed together, in the\
  \ small hall of Regent Hotel, not a single one of us felt like they didn\u2019t\
  \ belong there."
