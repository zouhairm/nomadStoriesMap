Text: "People don't usually head to a foreign country to get their hair done. But\
  \ when you're in a nation known for its beauty industry and beautiful people, as\
  \ South Korea is, hair suddenly becomes a big deal. Especially, when your roots\
  \ are growing out and look horrendous.\n\nAs a foreigner in one of the world's most\
  \ homogeneous countries, I stood out. Especially with my curly hair and tanned skin.\
  \ The peculiarity of my presence subsequently transformed me into a kind of poster\
  \ child for all people who looked remotely like me.\n\nUnder the burden of my new\
  \ responsibility, I need to take care of myself more. That's why my black roots\
  \ that clashed ungracefully with my light brown dye job became problematic. The\
  \ remedy was a salon appointment in Hongdae.\n\nSitting about a mile north of the\
  \ Han River that bisects Seoul, Hongdae is one of the hottest neighborhoods in the\
  \ city.  Three surrounding universities feed a rotating population of students into\
  \ the vein-like and sidestreets, fueling an industry of nightclubs, beauty parlors,\
  \ and eateries that leveraged innovation to lure customers. \n\nIn addition to being\
  \ a must-go-to spot for young visitors, it is an extremely foreigner friendly place.\
  \ So it shouldn't be too hard for an American gal to get her hair dyed, right?\n\
  \nThree hours later on the south side of the Han River in the working-class Yeongdeungpo\
  \ district, I snake through the ever-present crowd. Passing the old hunch-back selling\
  \ fruits by the pharmacy and bypassing a man lugging a cart of cardboard a three-story\
  \ cafe looms over me as I veer right to enter the back roads. \n\nDazzling neon\
  \ lights and ostentatious signs beckon people to a place that is not unlike a mini\
  \ Las Vegas. A K-pop song blared out of a norebang as I passed. I wondered if it\
  \ was that loud to draw people in or to cover the off-pitched singing of occupants\
  \ within.\n\nAt the heart of this Sin City is my AirBnB. My room, stuffy and hot,\
  \ matches my mood. The heat of helplessness and embarrassment over my hair are still\
  \ fresh. As was the ammonia that burned my scalp. \n\nHan Min-nam, my hairstylist,\
  \ had dyed my hair again after the first attempt yielded something I described as\
  \ i-sanghae, weird. The resulting coppery, rust-brown hair, unfortunately, was a\
  \ far cry from the chestnut color I wanted.\n\nA vibration from my pocket told me\
  \ I had a new message. \"Well, I hope you feel better soon,\" my friend Kameron\
  \ replied in response to my lamentation over the ordeal. \"I\u2019m proud you at\
  \ least went to have the experience,\" she wrote.  \n\nShe has a point, people don't\
  \ usually head to a foreign country to get their hair done. Food, music, history\
  \ and rare sights dominate trip itineraries. How did I get here? \n\nFor me, it\
  \ was the train ride. In the subway station and on trains people would look at me,\
  \ my clothes, and my curly hair. I was a poster child, a representative, I needed\
  \ to look perfect.\n\nSouth Korea has a way of making you pay more attention to\
  \ yourself. To take the train riders pass stunning celebrities and plastic surgery\
  \ success stories in advertisements that decorate walls. Body length mirrors in\
  \ key intersections distract people who slow as they eyed themselves for any imperfection.\
  \ A hand would to comb through styled hair or flick wily bangs into place before\
  \ feet hastened again to make the incoming train.\n\nSeoul's nine-line 283-station\
  \ subway system moves 7 million riders daily and many, like myself, spend a large\
  \ chunk of time traveling from place to place. At each stop, people get off and\
  \ on with each person evaluating the riders and their propriety that extended to\
  \ beauty. I had acclimated.\n\nI picked up my phone and opened the Kakao Talk chatroom\
  \ I had used to make my appointment with Han Min-nam the day before.  Typing quickly,\
  \ I thank him for his hard work, and that I liked my hair. Send. \n\nDing. \"THANK\
  \ YOU,\" Han wrote in all caps. \"I'll see you next time!\" he replied cheerfully.\
  \ I thought for a second. Maybe there would be a next time."
