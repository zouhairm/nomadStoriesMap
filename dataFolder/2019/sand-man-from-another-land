Text: "I met a man on the beach.\n \nHe came over wearing aged tattered clothing that\
  \ had long lost their colour, the same way he seemed to have lost his spirits.\n\
  \ \nHe asked my friend and I if we were interested in getting henna tattoos and\
  \ presented us with a book of all the different patterns and designs we could choose\
  \ from.\n \nAs he sat on the sand opposite us with his back to the sea, I watched\
  \ as he began painting the black paste onto her wrist.\nConversation taught us his\
  \ story.\n \nHe was selling his services as a henna artist in order to get by. A\
  \ slow and risky business where he is constantly having to keep a watchful eye out\
  \ for the police.\n \nHe told us that he was from Pakistan and that he missed being\
  \ back home.\n \n\u201CWhy did you come here?\u201D We asked.\n \n\u201CMoney.\u201D\
  \ He replied.\n \nThis was how he was making his living. I could see the pain behind\
  \ his eyes, the sadness masked in his voice and I wish I could have done more, perhaps\
  \ said something more to save this man from living a life that had been reduced\
  \ to this bland and repetitive cycle.\n \nThere we were on holiday, gazing at the\
  \ dying sun sinking into the blue horizon \u2013 a rare and wonderful sight to two\
  \ city girls, and there before us was a middle-aged man who had seen the same sun\
  \ and had walked the same lengths of the golden stretch of sand a thousand times.\
  \ All we could do was empathise and shake our heads disapprovingly at life\u2019\
  s harsh realities.\n \n\u201CWhat about your wife?\u201D We pondered.\n \n\u201C\
  No wife.\u201D He smiled. \u201CYou can be my wife.\u201D\n \nI watched the concentration\
  \ on his face as he paid attention to each detail. This was his life. The black\
  \ form on her wrist began to take shape into the anchor that had been promised.\
  \ The tattoo was complete and so was his business with us.\n \nBefore he left, he\
  \ gave us a final look of appreciation.\n \n\u201CThank you.\u201D He said. \u201C\
  You respect me.\u201D\nThese words I swear I\u2019ll take to my grave.\n \nWe watched\
  \ as he unfolded his legs and moved across the sands in his beaten slippers calling\
  \ Henna to unseeing sunbathers.\n \nI know I probably won\u2019t see that man again,\n\
  \ \nbut sir,\n \nI hope life treats your well."
