Text: "I woke up in the lights of the sun. Wait, isn't today December? Why there are\
  \ sun and bright sky outside of my apartments? Well, that's because we are in Barcelona\
  \ - colourful and noisy city which doesn't accept conventional Spanish rules.\n\
  I am just a simple student from Ukraine with a big passion for travelling. Have\
  \ you ever been to Ukraine? I guess you haven't because most people don't really\
  \ know anything about this country, which by the way, is the biggest country in\
  \ Europe (except for European part of Russia) and produces quite a lot potatoes\
  \ (yes, like good housewives we can feed a lot of people). But if you visit Ukraine\
  \ in December (or in any time from November till March) you will realise that having\
  \ sun in the sky isn't the thing that we are used to. Instead we are used to gray\
  \ landscapes, grumpy faces in black coats and dirty and frozen streets. I don't\
  \ want you to think badly about my homeland but this is the reality for which any\
  \ foreign guest should be ready (we really need more tourists just don't come in\
  \ the winter).\nThat time in Barcelona was not the first time I've been abroad.\
  \ And not the first time I've seen the sun in winter. But that was the first time\
  \ I've been so impressed by the city that I instantly felt in love with the whole\
  \ Spanish culture. Since that time I've been to Spain two more times enjoying a\
  \ lot of marvelous cities such as Madrid, Sevilla, Cadiz, Toledo, Cordoba etc, spent\
  \ a couple of years learning Spanish which is one of the most beautiful languages\
  \ that have ever existed and is so suspiciously easy for me that I start to think\
  \ that I'm doing something wrong, and read about a lot of Spanish programms for\
  \ foreign students which are quite expensive for me right now but I still dream\
  \ about them. I have never thought that one country which is really different from\
  \ your own country but at the same time has a lot in common with it can get into\
  \ one's soul in such a short time. \nLearning Spanish became my first serious hobby\
  \ that brought me to the thought that I would love to visit Latin America even though\
  \ it is considered to be poor and dangerous. Well, I come from poor and often dangerous\
  \ country so I guess I would feel there like at home. I am talking about this because\
  \ now I believe that a love for one place can open a lot of passions and desires\
  \ which can grow into something big like meaning of life or at least a dream. \n\
  All in all I didn't expect to find myself which is the best thing you can do (except\
  \ for finding a cure for AIDS - I'm a medical student so I had to mention something\
  \ related not only to travelling but also to medicine which is another great thing\
  \ to do) when you are young and reckless and have a whole world in front of you\
  \ waiting to be mastered or even conquered."
