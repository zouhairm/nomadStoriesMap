Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s a Great Day to Be Alive,\u201D split the brisk morning chill,\
  \ my alarm waking me to another day of work. This was the summer I volunteered as\
  \ an hospitalero (host), at a Spanish municipal albergue (hostel) for pilgrims on\
  \ the Camino de Santiago. I awakened to a dream come true.  A historian of antiquity,\
  \ I saw the ancient Roman bridge spanning the Rio Iso from my bunk in the Ribadiso\
  \ albergue, one of the oldest remaining pilgrim hospitals still in use.  It represented\
  \ the second to last stop before weary peregrinos (pilgrims) completed their 800\
  \ kilometer journey by walking through the final archway into the massive courtyard\
  \ of the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral 50 kilometers west. The Ribadiso albergue\
  \ perched on a bank above the Iso, whose sparkling blue waters cut through the pastoral\
  \ Galician fields of golden corn and wheat. \nThe pilgrims, weary and hot from their\
  \ afternoon trek from Palais de Rei, arrived from the east, crossing the bridge\
  \ into this small oasis with its shady stretches of napping grass and the river,\
  \ that river that more often than not tempted travelers to halt for an afternoon\
  \ soaking their aching feet in its healing waters. As a pilgrim nearly a year before,\
  \ I first encountered Ribadiso in this same way, breaking through the trees to find\
  \ that sleepy hallow, where I spent the best afternoon and evening of my month-long\
  \ pilgrimage. \nSeduced by its simple profundity, I returned this year to spend\
  \ two weeks welcoming the pilgrims and assigning them camas (beds) and trying my\
  \ best to explain in Spanish where the facilities and area attractions were located.\
  \ Every day I greeted sixty new faces with sixty life stories and reasons for walking\
  \ the camino; however, the only constants during my tenure were my mother who worked\
  \ with me on this assignment and the townspeople of Ribadiso. Every morning, I woke\
  \ at dawn to Travis Tritt\u2019s assurance of a great day to my morning task of\
  \ ensuring that the pilgrims had all left the albergue by seven before Salome and\
  \ Anna, the resident hospitaleras, arrived to clean the rooms and scold the occasional\
  \ late sleeper. Exiting my apartment, I was greeted by the jubilant songs of the\
  \ hundreds of birds feasting on the bounty of a sentinel cherry tree. Walking over\
  \ dewy grass in my bare feet, the large stone building loomed before me with its\
  \ sky-blue window sills closed against the previous night\u2019s chill. After checking\
  \ the rooms for any stragglers, I would head next door to the small bar for an Americano\
  \ and a glass of orange juice to watch the stream of pilgrims walking in the same\
  \ footsteps as the past two millennia of peregrinos. \nEvery day, certain faces\
  \ and stories stood out from the rest, and then one day, two faces burst through\
  \ the crowd lodging themselves in my mind and heart forever. Pascal and his wife\
  \ Mathilde were French Basque from the Pyrenees who were walking the pilgrimage\
  \ in reverse to honor their recently deceased son. Without a common language, we\
  \ patched together words and phrases from French, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese and\
  \ English, creating one of the most memorable dialogues in my life. Sharing an interest\
  \ in the Knights Templar, history, religion, and the world\u2019s pilgrimages, we\
  \ sat for hours shaded from the radiating sun that scared even the birds out of\
  \ its glare. Later over a beer, Pascal and Mathilde conveyed their heartbreaking\
  \ story about the loss of their beloved son, which had set them on the road to walk\
  \ every pilgrimage in the world in his memory. In a moment of rare human connection,\
  \ while my mother and Mathilde nearby floundered through their halting conversation\
  \ of flowers and greenhouses over multiple glasses of vino tinto, Pascal turned\
  \ to me and said sincerely, \u201CYou remind me so much of my son. Now, I am your\
  \ other father, and you are my other son.\u201D"
