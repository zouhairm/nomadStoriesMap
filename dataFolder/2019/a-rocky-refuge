Text: "Fifteen meters below the waterline, I hover over a rugged shelf littered with\
  \ acorn barnacles, waving beadlet anemones and long tendrils of kelp that lightly\
  \ brush my semi-dry suit with each rocking motion of the water. Bubbles gurgle around\
  \ my face as I twist my body towards my lead diver, Cathal, who floats just out\
  \ of sight on my blind side. He looks at me with eyes magnified inside his blue\
  \ rimmed mask, cheeks puffed around his regulator and framed by his tight black\
  \ hood. He signals descent with a downward gesture of his thumb. I look, puzzled,\
  \ at the surface mere inches below, but nevertheless follow him as he pushes through\
  \ the jungle of dancing weed. The visibility is terrible and for one entangled moment\
  \ all that exists is the rasping sound of breath being pulled through my reg. Then\
  \ suddenly the world drops away beneath me into a gaping expanse of blue-green ocean.\
  \ I find myself leaning out over an encrusted precipice, gazing with bated breath\
  \ into the encroaching darkness below.\n   A flicker of doubt causes hesitation\
  \ as I remember those first uncertain dives in my university pool. I had recently\
  \ lost my right eye in a bicycle accident and despite my keenness for the sport\
  \ I was flooded with anxieties about taking my patch off in the water. The exposure\
  \ could enable further damage and I didn\u2019t know what effects rapid pressure\
  \ changes could have on my new prosthetic. A tentative moment passes, but with a\
  \ resolute flick of my thumb I let some air from my BCD and feel myself falling\
  \ forwards, plunging down into the murky depths.  \n   Whilst I sink I feel the\
  \ pull of the current tugging at my body as the powerful waves above crash against\
  \ the ragged shores of Inishark. This island lies on the same archipelago as Inishbofin,\
  \ one of the most Westerly inhabited islands off the Irish coast. The next stop\
  \ is Newfoundland and Labrador, 3,058.28km away. Inisharks westerly orientation\
  \ to Inishbofin is partly the reason why its sister island still remains populated,\
  \ the other being the natural bay that hugs its southern face and protects it from\
  \ the brunt of the Atlantic\u2019s relentless pounding. It is the lack of any such\
  \ protection that led to the government mandate which forced the last inhabitants\
  \ of Inishark to the mainland in 1960 following a particularly cruel winter.\n \
  \  The persistent battering of the ocean still succeeds in gnawing away at the Silurian\
  \ slates and shales, its squalls pulverizing abandoned ruins and mingling them with\
  \ the scattered remains of historic Bronze Age settlements. The island\u2019s forlorn\
  \ graveyard, which juts from the rock face, slowly surrenders its dead into the\
  \ sea with each winter shudderingly endured. It is in these turbulent waters that\
  \ we now dive in a bid to explore this extreme coastal landscape.       \n   The\
  \ underwater cliff rises on our left in vibrant contrast to the gulping blue opposing\
  \ it. A whole ecosystem clings to this last rocky refuge before yielding itself\
  \ to the deep. I spot the familiar glimmer of a male cuckoo wrasse weaving around\
  \ tufts of spiky rose weed to get a better look at us. I search for the female and\
  \ spot her floating tentatively a few feet away. Cathal\u2019s torch illuminates\
  \ pale purple jewel anemones that cover a nearby overhang like a scab, causing them\
  \ to glow eminently. I feel my tensions resolve as we dip steadily below the 25\
  \ meter mark without incident. For the first time I am acutely focused on absorbing\
  \ the sensory experience which I find myself immersed in.\n   Black sea cucumbers\
  \ zigzag the wall like stout sentinels of the deep, broken intermittently by spiny\
  \ sea stars and spindly spider crabs clutching unsteadily to the vertical rock face\
  \ as they search for anchorage. A lion\u2019s mane jellyfish larger than a beach\
  \ ball suddenly emerges from the murk, pulsing silently as we veer cautiously around\
  \ it. The torch beam guides my eye to a squat lobster lurking in an alcove, long\
  \ antennae extended to peruse the drift for careless shrimp. Deep under the surface\
  \ of this wild, howling coastline, the current ebbs and wanes, and a sobering calm\
  \ is felt settling in its silent depths."
