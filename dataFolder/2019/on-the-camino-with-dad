Text: "In 2015 my father and I hiked the Camino de Santiago together. We had been\
  \ talking about the trip for years before that. When I was 10 years old my parents\
  \ had taken me out of school for three weeks to go on a family trip around Spain.\
  \ The experience was magical and a total waste on a 10-year-old. I was a book-worm\
  \ and would rather finish the next chapter in my latest book than wander around\
  \ a boring art museum like the Prado. Most of the journal that I kept for school\
  \ from that trip is filled with entries like, \u201CWe are lost again. Mom and Dad\
  \ are fighting again. I couldn\u2019t find a place to pee for over three hours in\
  \ the car.\u201D But somehow the seed for the Camino was planted. I think it was\
  \ late high school that I started pestering my dad about it, insisting that we do\
  \ it together. I started giving him something Camino-themed for every holiday. And\
  \ then in 2015 it we actually made it happen.\nThe Camino de Santiago or \u201C\
  The Way of Saint James,\u201D is a pilgrimage to the cathedral in Santiago de Compostela\
  \ in Spain, where the relics of St. James the Apostle reside. There are several\
  \ routes and pilgrims can start walking from any number of locations in Europe,\
  \ but the most well-known route is the Camino Frances. \nMy father and I started\
  \ our walk in St. Jean Pied-de-Port in France, crossed the Pyrenees, and proceeded\
  \ across Spain to Santiago de Compostela. We then went out to the coast of Spain\
  \ and walked between Muxia and Fisterra \u2013 \u201Cthe end of the world\u201D\
  \ to the pilgrims of old. The most common modern format for peregrinos on pilgrimage\
  \ is to walk all day and spend the night in pilgrim\u2019s hostels or albergues.\
  \ Dad and I eventually fell into our own personal rhythm of about 20km per day,\
  \ with a coffee break in the morning, picnic lunch from the market, afternoon beer\
  \ (or ice cream) break and dinner in our ending town. We discovered that bars would\
  \ often let us sit out in their plaza seating or picnic tables and eat our picnics\
  \ while drinking a cerveza con lim\xF3n (beer mixed with lemonade) from the establishment.\
  \ But at night is when the real magic often occurs. Before settling into a dormitory\
  \ full of snoring pilgrims we would have a pilgrim\u2019s dinner from a local eatery.\
  \ Pilgrim\u2019s dinners had a reliable format for a low set price, usually including\
  \ at least two courses\u2026and wine! Sometimes dinner included a whole bottle of\
  \ wine for one person because the wine was so inexpensive and it was easier than\
  \ trying to split a bottle between separate parties.  \nWine figured prominently\
  \ along our journey. As anyone who has visited Western Europe apparently knows but\
  \ I was thrilled to discover, wine is cheaper than water. Literally, in some cases.\
  \ You can walk (or limp) into any liquor or grocery store along The Way and buy\
  \ a lovely bottle of vino tinto for what amounts to less than $3 USD. It was a magnificent\
  \ new frontier of drinking, made even more exhilarating as it came on the heels\
  \ of the worst foot pain I have ever experienced from the cross-country trudge.\n\
  The Camino passes through several distinct regions of Spain and is often flanked\
  \ by long stretches of vineyards. It was the end of September as we transitioned\
  \ from Castilla Leon to Galicia and as we re-entered wine country, the harvest was\
  \ in full swing. Outside of Paraje there was a group of grape-pickers near the trail.\
  \ I\u2019d been enamored with the process that we\u2019d seen from a distance along\
  \ the trail and so I took the opportunity to chat with the workers in my imperfect\
  \ Spanish. The conversation was limited, but the group apparently found my attempts\
  \ endearing and one of the women handed me a huge bunch of dark maroon grapes to\
  \ sample. I shared with my dad and a few other pilgrims as I meandered down the\
  \ path and those grapes were unbelievable. I\u2019ve read prose in novels about\
  \ things tasting like sunshine, but with these grapes I really got it."
