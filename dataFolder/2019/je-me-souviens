Text: "I experienced two and a half year that felt like a just few months. Memory\
  \ is a funny thing; the more experiences you have, the more souvenirs you accumulate,\
  \ and at the same time you\u2019re left to wonder how this has already come to an\
  \ end.  \n \nI arrived in Montreal with no idea of what I would encounter. I was\
  \ very eager to find out about this former French colony, entirely occupied by the\
  \ English Canadians. Well, not entirely... One small state of indomitable Quebecois\
  \ still holds out against the invaders.\nMontreal is a two-faced sparkly lady. Half\
  \ English, half French, white hell in winter, green heaven in summer, it exposes\
  \ different intertwined realities depending on the time and space you get the chance\
  \ to meet her. \n\nI remember organizing a rave party deep into the woods, recreating\
  \ house spaces in the middle of the forest, cranking up techno and psytrance music\
  \ all night long. Hazy memories resurface in the most unexpected ways and often\
  \ more than once, it\u2019s the most bizarre that stick. Constructing a \u2018soundproof\
  \ wall\u2019 made of car tires at dawn or moving sound equipment in the middle of\
  \ the night to keep the party going are just some of the oddly fond ones I keep.\n\
  \nOn the way there, I asked the two Quebecois in my car what this \u2018Je me souviens\u2019\
  \ written on every car\u2019s licence plate meant, and funny enough they could not\
  \ remember.\n\nI recall the strange new French words, the old ones used in different\
  \ ways, the shameless mix of French and English, those old enemies meeting an unexpected\
  \ truce through multiple language appropriations. It\u2019s supposed to be the same\
  \ language, but French is different there, and while walking on the streets, I sometimes\
  \ did not even recognize my own mother tongue. \n\nEverything is bigger: the streets,\
  \ pavements, cars, parks, flats or any kind of space for that matter. In fact, I\
  \ even found myself taking part in a sizable community. Twenty-six atypical people\
  \ living in six different flats reunited to reflect, create and breath together\
  \ in order to offer cultural events to the city. \nTechno music was a constant,\
  \ days and nights were spent listening to those greasy heavy beats with trance always\
  \ lurking around the corner. Reminiscence of our hearts turned into beat machines,\
  \ bodies vibrating to the bass sounds and feet stomping the ground are still engrave\
  \ deep inside of me. We were giving a lecture to the earth, we were making a statement,\
  \ what was it\u2026 I seem to have forgotten. \n\nNature rules Canada, in Montreal\
  \ squirrels squeak and scream as if they own the place and raccoons salvage bins\
  \ in the city\u2019s own forest Mont Royal. So, you can imagine going into the wild\u2026\
  \ The first time I went camping, they gave us gear to hang up our food in the trees,\
  \ why you ask? A laconic one syllable word was our answer\u2026 Bears. I have memories\
  \ of Omega Park, Quebec own Serengeti version where deer replace buffalo, bears\
  \ for lions, moose for rhinoceros, wolves for leopards and bison for elephants.\
  \ \n\nSo yeah, some clich\xE9s have thick skin, however\u2026 I did not ski, did\
  \ not ice skate, did not ice fish, never rode a sled dog or snowmobile and never\
  \ even wore the iconic lumberjack flannel. I did swim in cold lakes, went camping\
  \ and survive outside in more than -30 degree Celsius. I had maple syrup, poutine\
  \ and ate in a sugar shack and had some surrealists\u2019 \u2018French\u2019 conversations\
  \ with locals, but this is all there for anyone to take or experience. Truthfully,\
  \ Montreal and Canada were about the meaningful encounters, heavy music and looking\
  \ for a sense of community, a truth that is speaking to you, but you can\u2019t\
  \ decipher. \n\nI found a piece of myself over there, a piece that was conceivably\
  \ already there. This piece is still with me, its reminiscences still over there,\
  \ nostalgia the only bridge left standing between these two sides of the same experience."
