Text: "I always have a lot of ideas in my mind about how to write or tell about those\
  \ stories or cases that occur in my life, I think about everything, but they remain\
  \ in my thoughts. And perhaps now is the only chance when I still have to start\
  \ writing. Of course, among the applicants will be professionals, to which I am\
  \ as far as the sky, but I'm a dreamer and I know that dreams tend to come true,\
  \ at least until today it was so. \nSo I'll start my story. One schoolgirl from\
  \ a small village once heard the conversation of her brother and parents about his\
  \ trip to America,(by the way he will go there only 10 years) and she had a dream\
  \ as soon as she turns 18 she will definitely go. As the days passed, and finally\
  \ came the very moment she goes to America, she seemed to have got into another\
  \ world, other people, other food, it all seemed as if it was all happening in a\
  \ dream. This program was only for the summer. The summer quickly ended and she\
  \ wanted to again there. At the first opportunity she went to different countries.\
  \ And since then, 8 years have passed and travel, travel has become for her like\
  \ a drug. Probably only those who once went abroad will understand. During these\
  \ 8 years she has traveled to 15 countries. It's not much, but for a girl from the\
  \ village, it's a very good start. Of course, each country, city has its own attractions,\
  \ features. And never was such that somewhere something did not like. \nNow Instagram\
  \ is very popular and like that one girl she saw a photo from Monaco. And since\
  \ she was sleeping and saw myself there, but for some reason thought it was something\
  \ unattainable. You know, this girl can be proud of her perseverance, purposefulness,\
  \ and lives under the motto \"if I want something, then it will be so\" and of course\
  \ after a while she goes to Monaco. It was a tour of Europe and the last place was\
  \ Monaco. There is so beautiful already breathtaking, and there she began to cry\
  \ from all that she sees, and grateful to her parents for the opportunities and\
  \ for their perseverance. Here is her dream-to visit Monaco, walk along the Cote\
  \ d'azur, swim in the Mediterranean sea, and just walk, and make the same photo\
  \ as the girl from Instagram. \nAnd every time her cherry leaf is replenished, and\
  \ she is sure that all that she has in this sheet will come true, and she wants\
  \ to go again to all these places with her mother..."
