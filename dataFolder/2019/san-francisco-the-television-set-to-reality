Text: "The City, she greets me with her grey sky, subtle drops of rain, she graciously\
  \ invites me in. The two glass doors of the San Francisco International airport\
  \ open, I step outside and simply found myself grasping for air, in pure disbelief\
  \ that I, am here. A visitor in her imagination comes\u2019 a light with the final\
  \ opportunity to explore her very being. The character of my choosing is here. \n\
  \nI look to my right, blinded by the many lights of several cars. I stand here,\
  \ awaiting my journey, settling for adventure, curiously wild and unknown. An entire\
  \ spring of excitement stirs up and bursts into shock as I see a familiar face.\
  \ I had traveled from Phoenix, Arizona to visit a friend I had met in New York.\
  \ Such comfort, as I heard the subtle Italian accent from my friend, murmur in my\
  \ ear. In still, silent shock, my love affair begins with the city. \nThe introduction\
  \ started off at a little town by the name of Sausalito. Sausalito is derived from\
  \ Spain, which means \u201Csmall willow grove.\u201D  A city, arrayed with houseboats,\
  \ colorful, bright and a calm inviting spirit. I was completely stunned by her movement,\
  \ within me. We walked along the marine, found ourselves a little coffee nook. Fred\u2019\
  s Place is a vibrant corner stop. The bright yellow sign, pavement chairs and tables,\
  \ the exhilarating view of the marine is enough to be committed. The warmth of the\
  \ coffee, pressed against my skin, the crisp air, had me at comfort. Sausalito might\
  \ have been my introduction to the windy city but, certainly pushed my pen to write\
  \ a new chapter. \n\nOur next stop certainly was the cities greatest teaser. All\
  \ the way up at twin peaks view, one overlooks the city of San Francisco. The idea\
  \ of having all the possibility in sight, gave me the fight to explore the possibility.\
  \ I can still see myself, standing there, black rubber boots, grey coat, pushing\
  \ my hair back behind my ears, in complete awe of just how beautiful our universe\
  \ truly is. The lush green trees, the creative\u2019s behind every detail set in\
  \ the concrete of buildings, texture, sound, and all here in accordance with me.\
  \ I could certainly stay here, staggered in mindfulness and free falling in her\
  \ beauty, I had to know more. I needed to see more. I had to feel more of her. \n\
  \nWe drove down twin peaks, into all I had just witnessed, imagined and more.  The\
  \ colorful houses, trees, became more prominent, more inviting, and louder. Trolley\
  \ trains from all across the world, heading up the streets, the loud parade colors\
  \ in the corner of my eye, such promise, such love, is here. I rolled down my window\
  \ stuck my head out, smiling as wide as my face would allow me, I am here. I am\
  \ literally crossing the famous Bay Bridge. I was no longer a visitor at a television\
  \ screen, or a reader to an article. I was the content. Living and breathing.\n\n\
  The Beauty behind any traveler is what you experience, how it experienced you and\
  \ most importantly, how you share this experience together with the eyes and ears\
  \ of the world. There was plenty more I had seen, more personality swelled within\
  \ me from the breathe of she, the City. This here is the true beauty, the simple\
  \ truth of accomplishment, acknowledging San Francisco beauty as I had lived it."
