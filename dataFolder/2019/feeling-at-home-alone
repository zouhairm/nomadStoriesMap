Text: "\u201CTable for one, miss?\u201D\n\nI nodded, eager to sit down and finally\
  \ have a drink. I was finally at my hotel in Ambergris Caye after cab, boat, and\
  \ golf cart rides from Belize City. This was my second solo trip and I still haven\u2019\
  t gotten the hang of navigating international travel on my own. As a young woman,\
  \ I\u2019m always vigilant about my surroundings. As a type A, plan-ahead young\
  \ woman in a foreign country on her own, my stress receptors were on overload.\n\
  \nThankfully, I had picked the right place to untangle my bundle of nerves. Lina\
  \ Point Overwater Resort was in the north, quiet side of Ambergris Caye, even quieter\
  \ now that Belize entered its off-peak season. I was so excited to stay in Belize\u2019\
  s only overwater resort that I moved my original travel dates so I could book a\
  \ first-floor room with a glass bottom floor \u2013 so worth it.\n\nThe golf cart\
  \ ride, however, took a little bit longer than I expected. After my driver Minor\
  \ picked me up at the ferry terminal, we drove straight through downtown, past the\
  \ shops, hotels, restaurants, over a bridge, then about another mile until we made\
  \ the left into Lina Point. It looked so much closer on Google Maps. Thus, I ended\
  \ up at the on-site restaurant for dinner, the quiet night punctuated only by the\
  \ sound of the US Open blaring from the TV.\n\nEager for some human interaction,\
  \ I turned to Hector, the cook, and asked \u201CSo, uh, do you always watch tennis?\u201D\
  \n\nWhile preparing my meal, he says \u201COh yeah, all the time! I\u2019m a huge\
  \ fan!\u201D\n\nTremendous, except I wasn\u2019t. But with the help of a quick Google\
  \ search, I chatted with Hector about Serena William\u2019s rebound from her difficult\
  \ child birth and Naomi Osaka, the new favorite.\n\nHector brought over the jerk\
  \ chicken I had ordered, complete with a side of rice, beans, and plantains. \u201C\
  So what are you doing while you\u2019re in Belize?\u201D \n\nI outlined my plans\
  \ for a snorkeling tour, and a few other sites I wanted to see. As I finished my\
  \ meal, Hector gave me some advice for enjoying my time here. Definitely get a golf\
  \ cart, sunscreen, and mosquito repellant. Full of jerk chicken, I thanked him for\
  \ the meal and the advice, paid for my meal, and told him that I hoped to see him\
  \ again while I was at Lina Point. \n\nHe beamed, \u201CI\u2019m not going anywhere!\u201D\
  \n\nOver the next few days that I was at Ambergris Caye, I snorkeled the Belize\
  \ Barrier Reef, hiked the ruins of Altun Ha, and went out to the not-so-secret Secret\
  \ Beach on the northernmost point of the island. I befriended some of the tour guides\
  \ and tourists on my tours but more importantly, I spent glorious stretches of time\
  \ by myself \u2013 away from the expectations and demands of the modern world.\n\
  \nThe line between being alone and loneliness is a narrow one. On my solo adventures,\
  \ I\u2019ve had to open myself to people and experiences that I ordinarily wouldn\u2019\
  t when traveling with friends. In doing so, I\u2019ve found more in common with\
  \ others than differences. \n\nOn my last night there, I worked up the courage to\
  \ ask Hector for his jerk chicken recipe. I mean, what better souvenir than jerk\
  \ from the Caribbean? Hector was more than enthusiastic. He listed off the ingredients\
  \ and instructions while I wrote it down. Chicken bouillon, black pepper, Grace\u2019\
  s jerk seasoning. \u201CAnd the secret ingredient?\u201D he said conspiratorially,\
  \ \u201CMustard!\u201D\n\nMore in common, indeed."
