Text: I've been searching for ways to travel the most. Experience is the best teacher.
  and a traveler, the best student. I've been traveling this year, I am Living and
  studying on Spain, Im Mexican. I went this December with all my saving to Vietnam.
  My life was changed. I got now an schoolarship to go to Argentina to keep studying
  there. Also Im trying to get the erasmus Scholarship to france. I've been doing
  all I can to keep Travelling. Not for pictures, even though I love taking them,
  you can search my Instagram @antoniogoolv,  I travel for life, for knowledge. I
  want to fill my brain with knowledge, I want to learn new ways of life. With travelling
  you understand the bases of life. You can't own life, or keep life, you can only
  Live it and make it. I want to travel to live, and learn to make. Life is my path
  and my feet my vehicle.  A leap of faith, is all you need. This year was my first
  year travelling completely alone. It's so powerful. You feel you are riding the
  horses with yoyr hands, and you learn how mucho value Humility and Kindness has.
  I want to keep learning values of men in the world. and keep feeling the welcomeness
  of locals to foreneign, and keep sharing, as I do , All my  knowledge to whomever
  I encounter. The only true power is knowledge. The only true change comes from knowledge.
  We just gotta connect to one another.
