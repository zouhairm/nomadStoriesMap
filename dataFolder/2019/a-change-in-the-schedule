Text: "When I visited Istanbul for the first time, I was impressed by the architecture.\
  \ You are surrounded by mosques and palaces that make you start wondering how someone\
  \ can live in this city without being shocked by its beauty and history every day.\
  \ However, I guess I found the answer during my second visit to Istanbul. My second\
  \ time was different because I stayed in a local area, a place so far away from\
  \ all the touristy places that you would usually visit. To be honest, I was kind\
  \ of devastated at first. After all, I am in Istanbul for a vacation. On my first\
  \ day there, I woke up thinking about how troublesome it would be to find the bus\
  \ stop, and then navigate my way through the streets to reach my destination. However,\
  \ I was faced by something unexpected at all. As soon as I stepped outside my hotel,\
  \ I found that there was this weekly local bazaar, where you can buy everything\
  \ from your fruits to your electronics. I decided to explore this bazaar, and I\
  \ was definitely pleased. Everywhere was crowded with stands for goods, buyers trying\
  \ to find the best deal, and sellers shouting how much everything was. This somehow\
  \ reminded me of my home, and I thought that living in Istanbul is the same as living\
  \ in Ramallah or any city in the world. Yes, you will be enchanted by the sea, the\
  \ mosques and the museums. However, you will be more amazed by those local bazaars\
  \ and the welcoming people. With my close to zero knowledge in Turkish I found myself\
  \ trying so hard to communicate with the sellers, but everyone was warm and excited\
  \ that I found myself spending two hours there without noticing.\nWith my schedule\
  \ thrown out of the window, I decided to change directions, and explore my hotel\
  \ area more. The streets were full of little cafes and restaurants that offer an\
  \ authentic Turkish breakfast. A particular one stood out though.  It was by no\
  \ means something fancy or eye catching, but what drew me in was the smell of freshly\
  \ baked pastry and the aromatic coffee. \nOne thing that people don\u2019t tell\
  \ you while travelling alone is that you have to be confident. I was in my head,\
  \ thinking about the best way to introduce myself and order whatever I want to drink\
  \ or eat, when a voice interrupted me. I looked in the voice\u2019s direction and\
  \ was greeted by the most magnificent mustache I have ever seen. There was an old\
  \ man, 60 or maybe 70 years old, I could not tell, and he was ushering me to sit\
  \ with him on the same table. I was worried because I did not know more than hello\
  \ and water in Turkish, which cannot help me that much here. However, as soon as\
  \ I sat down, I noticed a board game with two dices and black and red circles. I\
  \ vaguely recognized the game, but I had no idea how to play. Concern was clearly\
  \ showing on my face, because the old man, whose name is Cemil, started organizing\
  \ the circles, and I kind of understood that the best way to learn is to try and\
  \ observe. Underestimating the difficulty of the game, I was clearly losing. However,\
  \ I honestly did not care. I was playing backgammon, a Turkish traditional game\
  \ that I knew the name of after googling it later, and I told him about Palestine\
  \ and the place I grew up in. With our broken languages we managed to somehow start\
  \ a conversation and enjoy our time. I cannot remember how much time I spent in\
  \ that little cafe, all I know is that I realized how beautiful and absurd the situation\
  \ was. I could have strolled down the street, without paying attention to Cemil\
  \ or to the little coffee shop, but I am glad I did not. I made a connection in\
  \ an unexpected place, with an unexpected person."
