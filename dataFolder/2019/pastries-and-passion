Text: "Was it the sweet aromas of the bustling morning rush that swept me up or was\
  \ it the glistening of the golden statues at Pont Alexandre fountain that made me\
  \ feel overwhelmed with magic? \n\nStarting out my year looking for love \u2013\
  \ I decided to travel to the city where is all happens. Paris!\nAfter a long-haul\
  \ flight from Australia, backpack weighing a tonne and nervously grasping at my\
  \ hand-written directions, I headed towards my home-stay on Rue Yves Toudic.\n\n\
  \u2018There is a bakery on the corner, with the best croissants in all of Paris\u2019\
  \ my host had mentioned in the email. Spotting the shopfront in the distance, well-dressed\
  \ locals exit the grand corner store, hugging brown paper bags filled with sweet\
  \ treats to get them through the day. \n\nThe smell of cooked butter and burnt sugar\
  \ lead the way, fueling my craving for a Parisian pastry. \u201CExcusez\u201D, a\
  \ young lady pushed past me as I  inconveniently stood in the way. Shuffling to\
  \ the side an attendant nodded for my order, \u201COne Almond Croissant please\u201D\
  . As she placed the goods in the bag, I caught her eye-roll while handing it over\
  \ the counter.   \n\nStepping outside, I continued on my way not letting the bakery\
  \ encounter get in the way of my euphoria. Arriving at large red double doors, I\
  \ buzzed the intercom. \u201CEllo\u201D, a sweet French accent responded. \u201C\
  Hello, its Anna, your house guest from Australia\u201D. \u201CBonjour Anna, welcome,\
  \ please come up to the fifth floor\u201D\n\nEntering the lobby, a spiral staircase\
  \ set upon me. Taking a deep breath I persisted to push through with the last ounce\
  \ of energy I had left. \n\u201CWelcome to Paris Anna, I\u2019m Martine, (kiss on\
  \ each cheek), you must be tired. Let me take your bags\u201D. A middle-aged woman\
  \ greeted me dressed in a white linen blouse tucked into her jeans, her hair out\
  \ with a natural wave; she was so effortlessly chic yet naturally elegant. \n\n\u201C\
  Thank you Martine, you have a lovely home.\u201D I wandered around the apartment\
  \ placing handing over my backpack.  \u201CDo you mind if I take a rest, I\u2019\
  m tired from the flight?\u201D \n\u201COf course, I have set aside some towels for\
  \ you to freshen up. My son is coming over tonight; I thought it would be nice for\
  \ you to meet him. Would you like to join us a little later? \n\nWith only a hot\
  \ shower and sleep on my mind, I wasn\u2019t in any mood to socialise. Politely\
  \ responding, \u201CSure, that sounds lovely\u201D as I make my way towards the\
  \ bathroom. \n\nHours pass, I roll over sleepily unaware of my surroundings. \u2018\
  Where am I\u2019? The sounds of clinking wine glasses fill the air and French accents\
  \ speaking rapidly. \u2018THE DINNER\u2019! Leaping out of bed I race to the bathroom\
  \ to wash my face and smear some lipstick on. Pulling on a pair of pants and clean\
  \ t-shirt I scrunched my hair as I passed the mirror. \n\nWalking into the lounge\
  \ area Martine was in the kitchen stirring some pots. A tall rugged looking man\
  \ with his back towards me was observing the books on the bookcase, wine glass in\
  \ hand. \u201CYou\u2019ve woken Anna\u201D Martine enters from the kitchen \u201C\
  This is my son, Javier\u201D as she walks towards the rugged man. \nHe turns to\
  \ meet my eyes and we are both brought to a standstill. He greets me with a nervous\
  \ smile, slight twitch in his lips and twinkle in his eye. Does he feel as taken\
  \ back as what I do right now, like time has completely stood still? \n\n\u201C\
  Hello\u201D, he finally breaks the silence with a croaky voice. I stand there staring\
  \ at him like I was star struck, unable to find any words to exit my mouth.\nMartine\
  \ breaks the silence saying, \u201CCoup de Fondre?\u201D meaning \u2018Love at first\
  \ sight\u2019?"
