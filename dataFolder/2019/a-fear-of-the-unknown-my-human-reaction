Text: "Fear is an irrational imaginary state of being that is necessary in some circumstances\
  \ but completely debilitating in others. Some are born with the wandering gene,\
  \ born to travel or search for their true place of belonging. To understand themselves\
  \ and others in ways that their current situation of repetitiveness does not allow.\n\
  \nThat's how I saw myself. I imagined I would easily and effortlessly globe trot\
  \ with curiosity and excitement but that was not how it went on my first trip to\
  \ Morocco . I found that reading about a culture or seeing the external tip of the\
  \ iceberg in action through media , documentaries or films was in no way a true\
  \ representation of day to day life or the values and beliefs that formed society.\n\
  \nI felt like an alien or another planet. Lost in language barriers, lost in the\
  \ noticeable change of climate and environment. The smells, the sound of continuous\
  \ car horns, the rush of people and the armed police that were dotted around the\
  \ airport and city. This was all normal day to day life, swirling around me, just\
  \ normal people doing their normal activities and yet the capital Rabat, seemed\
  \ to me like I had indeed, rocketed out of the comfort of my familiar small Irish\
  \ village and had landed in a land where I felt unable to process the scenes and\
  \ uneducated as to how I should behave. Whatever anxiety that lingered inside now\
  \ multiplied with each passing second. \t\n\nI was so glad that my host was by my\
  \ side, my only connection to navigate through a country where I could not connect\
  \ through speech. I was relieved to get to his house where I could take some time\
  \ to adjust. Unable to speak much, and struggling with doubting thoughts that screamed\
  \ \u201Cwhy?\u201D, \u201CWhy did you come here\u201D? I excused myself early that\
  \ evening to sleep and familiarize myself with my surroundings and to convince myself\
  \ that two weeks is not that long and that I will be home again. \n\nI knew that\
  \ this was a Muslim country and that fives times a day the call for prayers would\
  \ be made but the last thing I expected was to experience such an intensive reaction\
  \ to one of these calls. I did not know that the person calling for prayers would\
  \ be in the street at dawn very close to my window. I hadn\u2019t expected it to\
  \ be on a PA system. In hindsight, I was so naive and under prepared. I was in a\
  \ restless sleep on that first night,in the TV room, dreaming of a swirling body\
  \ in the room. I was aware of the room as if I was awake. Then I heard this unusual\
  \ music, enchanting and drawing me out to the street. Coaxing me to follow, beckoning\
  \ me to float out and join them. However, this body in the room was pulling me back,\
  \ holding me back, whispering to me that I should stay inside. I woke with a start,\
  \ soaked and frightened white. I was disoriented . It took me a few minutes to remember\
  \ where I was and to realize that this strange sound was coming from outside and\
  \ was a call to pray. I did not return to sleep after that and kept my experience\
  \ to myself. I waited for morning so that the real exploration could begin.\n\n\
  It would be a lie to say that everything changed after that or that I suddenly felt\
  \ like I belonged or became at ease with the situation. Unfortunately, as soon as\
  \ I got a little used to a city and the feeling it emitted to me, my host would\
  \ bring me to another part of Morocco. To me, it was like jumping countries. My\
  \ fear spoiled my experience, I should be writing about all the beautiful things\
  \ I saw and the kind people I met but what I remember most is the intense unnecessary\
  \ fear that  although I am determined to never feel again, I believe I could never\
  \ overcome if I did not leap into the unknown,"
