Text: "The bright sunshine, so warm in my skin, was the first thing I noticed as I\
  \ stepped out of the train in Sutomore, Montenegro. I was tearing up slightly from\
  \ saying goodbye to a mother and child I had met on the Belgrade to Bar journey.\
  \ I had been traveling alone for more than half a year now, and meeting Aneta and\
  \ her sweet boy made me remember and long for my own family, thousands of kilometers\
  \ away in Brazil. \n\nIt was a scorching July morning, full of beautiful east european\
  \ couples dressed in fancy beachwear, children running around and screaming in a\
  \ language I could not understand and tired looking locals, either working or getting\
  \ to work. Anxious to get rid of my enormous backpack and cure my homesickness with\
  \ a relaxing day at the beach, I set to find my home for the next three days: Rooms\
  \ Lazarev\xEDc. \n\nAfter about 20 minutes roaming around these confusing beachtown\
  \ streets, and finding no English speakers who could help me, I called the owner\
  \ of the apartments. Hopefully, Moris could understand me, and even managed to discover\
  \ where I was, even though I could only give a small pizzeria as reference. He found\
  \ me sitting at the curb, munching on what felt like the greatest piece of marguerita\
  \ pizza I had ever tasted. Hmmm, the taste of fresh basil. \n\nAbout five minutes\
  \ later, he parked at the entrance of a wide green passageway, that led to the main\
  \ house and the other small apartments. In front of the house, there was a beautiful\
  \ garden that smelled of orange blossoms, my favorite. As I walked closer to investigate\
  \ the strawberry patches, an old lady, of about 60 years old,  walked out of the\
  \ house. She approached me and said: \"Oi querida, tudo bem?\" For those unaware,\
  \ she was speaking Portuguese. I don't remember exactly what I said, but I walked\
  \ closer to her and embraced her, a traditional Brazilian greeting. I could not\
  \ believe it, but it looked like I had found a small patch of home, just when I\
  \ was needing it the most. \n\nSutomore - and Montenegro - are gorgeous, vastly\
  \ undiscovered places that hold some of the greatest landscape gems I have ever\
  \ seen. Turquoise seawater and grainy beige sand in one side, incredible rock mountains\
  \ from the other, but still, the best discovery I made in this episode of my travels\
  \ were Tiana - a sweet person who reminded me of the incredible power and meaning\
  \ of the word home."
