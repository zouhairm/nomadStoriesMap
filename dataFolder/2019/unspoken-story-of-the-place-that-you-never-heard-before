Text: "I walked barefoot on the soft white soil, stopping for sometimes and then to\
  \ admire the surreal beauty of the forest behind and the dazzling shadow of Mountains\
  \ in front of me  on the crystal clear river. The sun was about to set on the other\
  \ side of the mountain and the river was acted as a border between two countries\
  \ India and Bhutan. As the gentle waves stroked me, I was continuously chatting\
  \ with her; a beautiful lady in her thirties wearing a traditional Assamese dress\
  \ called dokhona. Standing in middle of the water ,  balanced on the rocks, she\
  \ asked me \u201Cwhere I am now ? India or Bhutan?? \u201C\n\nIt was ten past seven\
  \ and the village was as silence as dark. The concoction of wild flowers and wet\
  \ black soil produced an attractive earthy aroma. I was sitting on a bamboo made\
  \ chair in the lawn of mud house and she sat just a campfire ahead. Our laughter\
  \ and chitchat has suddenly stopped when sound of a Bihu tune begrudgingly moved\
  \ towards us. Durga, her name poured some local rice beer on my empty glass and\
  \ asked \u201C Do you find this place unsafe for the World?\u201D. I was so engrossed\
  \ into the tune and the taste of Zarwo (Silkworm fry) , it took me a while to understand\
  \ her meaning and why not? My entire perception of these indigenous people and the\
  \ locality got changed when first time I stepped here at  lush green paddy fields\
  \ surrounded by bamboo trees. I did not answer her question only to thank myself\
  \ to not to listen of my closed ones who have either not heard about this place\
  \ or have some different opinions. According to media the name Bodoland was taken\
  \ with scepticism because of the violent confrontation created by tribals and the\
  \ illegal immigrants of Bangladesh. Life is not easy anywhere but still important\
  \ how we lead our lives. By looking at her and the dark where electricity is luxury\
  \ , I murmured myself \u201Cgive them a reason to smile, give them a reason to \
  \ live.\u201D\n\n\nWe began the morning while breathing fresh air in the mid of\
  \ Manas National park while enjoying a ride of Elephant. The same afternoon I found\
  \ myself  roaming at Manas Maozigendri Ecotourism Society where the poachers of\
  \ Rhinos have become protectors now. These people left their good earning because\
  \ of the education they got from local NGOs and I felt good that they are trying\
  \ to maintain the social responsibility. By the time we had some Pitha (dessert\
  \ made by rice grains ) and laal cha (black tea made by jaggery) I got to know about\
  \ many people who were killed above 100 animals now protecting them, creating roads,\
  \ reinforcing houses and educating the next generation about  the importance of\
  \ Biodiversity. My next stop was my reason to visit the place; a local festival\
  \ called Dwijing. I found the festival pulled me to its vivid projects while was\
  \ taking me to an alternate world. I was the onlooker of the workmanship and their\
  \ diverse exercises lured me to an ever increasing extent. Durga explained about\
  \ Dwijing - the River Festival where the Bodo tribal come together to promote river\
  \ tourism and to provide a livelihood opportunity for local people. Started in 2016\
  \ with the name of \u201CAie river festival\u2019 later changed its name to \u201C\
  DWIJING \u201D to showcase the river \u201CAie\u201D and its importance.  The festival\
  \ was geared towards the tribe, but travelers were welcome to join.\n\nI spent my\
  \ week with Bodo people at village and witnessed the simplicity and hardships borne\
  \ by the villagers. No electricity, long way to reach hospitals, schools, tough\
  \ to earn basics by collecting firewood, fishing by local made Jakoi and Khaloi\
  \ ( bamboo sticks type) , weaving through loom and facing social issues.\n\nPart\
  \ of me wanted to stay. It's not easy to come back at the same city of rat race.\
  \ It's not easy to forget those smiles, toxin free air , the river , the local food,\
  \ the festival, heart touching welcome, the place where I witnessed of black and\
  \ white soils together ; I still mesmerize the safe sunset in between the rural\
  \ place."
