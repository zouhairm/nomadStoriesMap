Text: "I have been in Thailand for nearly six months to stay with my parents who work\
  \ as lecturers in a university here. \nAround November, a family friend sent them\
  \ a link to a Model United Nations Conference and encouraged me to join. It was\
  \ anxiety-inducing; for two whole months I was unable to sleep properly thinking\
  \ about my position paper and researching as much as I could. I'm a first-timer.\n\
  \nFast forward to January 30, 2019. My mom and I went to Bangkok for the conference.\
  \ She dropped me off at Windsor Hotel, a posh 4-star hotel at the heart of Bangkok.\
  \ There I was told that my registration details for the conference were at a different\
  \ hotel, just behind Windsor. Still, it was no minor inconvenience as I had heavy\
  \ bags and we were not informed via email of the last minute hotel switch.\n\nHuffing\
  \ frustratedly at the elevator to retrieve my things, two Nepalese students hurriedly\
  \ tried to stop my from going down because they were in a similar position as me.\
  \ It was a good thing that I hadn't pressed the button for the hotel lobby yet,\
  \ and hastily reopened the elevator. There, I complained again and asked if they\
  \ were in a similar position. We asked the committee and they also don't know why\
  \ the organisers neglected to inform us. \n\nHowever, I'm thankful. If I hadn't\
  \ been in a position where I was so frustrated, I never would have met two wonderful\
  \ people who eventually became two of my closest friends. They introduced me to\
  \ Nepal, showed me pictures, the girl even gave me a pair of earrings she made.\
  \ They promised that they'd make time for any of their friends who will visit Nepal\
  \ someday.\n\nAside from them, I also met other people of my nationality during\
  \ the conference. They too, have become my closest friends. We were all bonded together,\
  \ different cultures, traditions, and nationalities because we wanted to solve complex\
  \ world issues. Our meeting sessions focused on the climate crisis and the solutions\
  \ that low-income countries need to alleviate the climate crisis' burden on them.\n\
  \nWe did explore Bangkok, but I know the city, the food, and the culture very well.\
  \ What fascinated me more than anything was how these new people fell in love with\
  \ Thailand just as much as I did. Beyond the ones in my immediate new circle, talking\
  \ with other people from different cultures and usually stereotyped ones, made me\
  \ appreciate diversity even more. Without it, how bland this world would be. Their\
  \ passion and insights are a direct reflection of the plight of their country. Unlike\
  \ actual politicians, these young people also consider the global effects of policies\
  \ before deciding to make it final. \n\nWhen I met a vast number of people at the\
  \ conference, I fell in love with all of them. I see not just people, but also their\
  \ countries proud and beautiful: from the obscure countries of Africa to the little\
  \ island-countries of Asia, they were there for a cause, not superficial or pretentious\
  \ ones. There was actual unity among these countries and it made me think that if\
  \ in the future, they will replace incapable leaders of their nations, these young\
  \ leaders will truly make a better world. \n\nThere might be a lot of bad in this\
  \ world, but there is a lot of good in it, too."
