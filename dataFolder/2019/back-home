Text: "Everyone has inside three special places. The First is your home city, the\
  \ second is tour Heart's house,where you feel home(to me is my Holliday Little Village\
  \ in Liguria), the third is the unknown and unexplorated Place where your Heart\
  \ guides you. The last one for me was Australia. When i was five i listened my aunt\
  \ australian Story, when i was twelve i dreamt to escape to Australia,when i was\
  \ sixteen i won a contest and i left. I spent five months there, i knew a lot of\
  \ people coming from all the world and i lived a very different reality but what\
  \ impressed me more was the nature that i discovered. The Red of sunset and the\
  \ blue of Ocean, the coluored, noisy birds in the Skye and the smart, fast Dolphins\
  \ in the water. In praticular i loved the Two weeks' Outback trip. I remember the\
  \ Bright of stars in the middle of nothing. I remember the firework and the guys\
  \ sitted in circle. I remember the Story of a girl birth the same day of her granma,\
  \ the same face,the same voice, the same Energy and the way she woke up Every year\
  \ the day of her brithday on her grandma's favourite sof\xE0 After had felt asleep\
  \ in her own bad, how she said they were the same soul. I remember the sound of\
  \ larves when i ate them, crunch, as Little Chips,the jolts in the camel's hump,\
  \ the color of Aborigens'paints, their stolen identity, locked up in reservs, the\
  \ fear and enthusiasm of swimming in a lake Surrounded by crocodiles, the soft of\
  \ koala's fur. But What i remember most, What i'll Never forget It's how i felt\
  \ strongly and irreedimably alive, how i changed and how,cause of this, i feel strict\
  \ in my today Life. This story happened three years ago and i would Like to thanks\
  \ to have had the occasione to write all this e feel all this emotions,again,another\
  \ time,i'm grateful for the occasion of remember. I would say that Memories at the\
  \ end It's all that we have, It would sounds poetic but It would be false. What\
  \ i have at the end are not only memories, that shades with time, but a new Force\
  \ inside of me and some more Friends beside."
