Text: "So, this was the second day of solo trip, I was waiting on hills of Nahargarh,for\
  \ the Sun to rise.\U0001F304\n.\n.\nToday, I decide to do at least one thing, that\
  \ I HAVE NOT DONE BEFORE. So, I started the day super early. And thought to explore\
  \ the city on bike.  I have never been on the bike with someone other than my brother\
  \ and Dad. I know this may sound weird. I just don't feel comfortable.\nBut today\
  \ was the day of challenging my comfort zone. \nI booked an uber bike and confidently\
  \ boarded it. \nThe driver gave me a helmet and he seems to be professional. And\
  \  as we pass the jaipur city to reach Nahagarh fort, I was amazed by the beauty\
  \ of city in the morning. \nIt was pleasant morning, I was feeling the breeze touching\
  \ my face. There was fragrance of \"agarbati\" and \"Dup\" from tiny temples near\
  \ the road. It was so refreshing. There were different smell in air, I smelt freshly\
  \ made \"kachories\" while passing some lane.\n.\nI was completely enjoying my time,\
  \ was super happy about my decision to take this challenge.\n.\n.\nLife was feeling\
  \ perfect, with my hair tangled completely in air.\nWe reached the end of the Pink\
  \ city with Jal Mahal on side. .\nI have no idea about route, so we were in valley\
  \ now. And the valley was silent, no one was around,except few people at distance\
  \ for morning walks.\n.\nNow, we were passing the silent jungle in valley. And my\
  \ mind was so scared. It made me think about all the possible negative things that\
  \ can happen at that moment of time. We kept on moving. Even in this fear, the hills\
  \ and sky looked so beautiful to me that was helping me keep calm.\nThere were different\
  \ stages of emotions, or alot of emotions mixed. I was happy, scared, feeling strong,\
  \ amazed, excited, thoughtful. .\n. \nI remember there was a moment when we reached\
  \ the middle of the valley and I felt FEARLESS, all my negative thoughts got vanished\
  \ in air. I didn't understand the magic happened. But it changed my thoughts. I\
  \ was so much confident about everything on the top of the hills. I realised, the\
  \ key to remove the fear about anything in life is FACING THAT FEAR.\nAnd when you\
  \ overcome that, you  will be feel bombshell. U will feel, easy and fearless!!\u2B50\
