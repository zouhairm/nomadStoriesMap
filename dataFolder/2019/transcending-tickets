Text: "I ended the call from my deflated ex in Uyuni, knowing in my heart I was embarking\
  \ on an adventure into the unknown. I cancelled my surf lessons in North Peru, grabbed\
  \ my backpack, and set out to locate his abandoned passport in La Paz. With the\
  \ hope of getting to Oruro in time to catch the weekly train to Uyuni, I mapped\
  \ out that it would require me covering 3,256.4 km in less than twenty four hours\
  \ in order to reunite Aaron with his passport and then enjoy a tour of the Bolivian\
  \ salt flats together. Ambitious, yes. Doable, maybe?\n\n1 flight, two hostel visits\
  \ and a lot of Spanish phase book usage later; Aaron's passport was successfully\
  \ and safely in my hands. As I marched up the steep cobbled streets of La Paz, the\
  \ weight of my backpack became truly notable for the first time, along with the\
  \ hours that had slipped away getting to this point of my journey. Believing I had\
  \ the hardest part behind me, the next stage was a four-hour bus ride to Oruro.\n\
  \nConfusion ensued; as locals hustled from one bus to another and listed departure\
  \ times were vague at best. But I secured my ticket, and front seat on the next\
  \ leg of my trip. Sitting, staring out to the vast, long road that lay ahead I tried\
  \ to settle my nerves as I surrendered to being at the mercy of Bolvian public transport.\
  \ As the sunset, and the lights to the next town became tiny specs on the horizon,\
  \ like the stars now encompassing the sky, the lingering thought that I might not\
  \ make it started to feel all so true. After trying to call Aaron to no-avail, the\
  \ elderly local sat beside me, without a word, gently squeezed my hand, looked at\
  \ me with her wise brown eyes and gave me a comforting smile. She didn\u2019t know\
  \ my story, but clearly sensed the comfort I needed.\nWe made the not so uncommon\
  \ stop to collect roadside passengers from a broken down bus during which I sat\
  \ and prayed with all my might that we would not face the same fate. As the bus\
  \ finally pulled into Oruro, I scrambled out my seat, shrieked \u2018taxi\u2019\
  \ and leaped into the nearest open car door. I had exactly 9 minutes until my one\
  \ option out of Oruro departed. After weaving the back streets in a somewhat formula1\
  \ style, I speedily slapped dollars into my drivers hand as I made haste for the\
  \ train.\n\nRunning towards the station platform, I heard the train signalling its\
  \ departure. My stomach dropped, but my heart told me, there\u2019s still hope.\
  \ Without a second thought, I ran towards the luggage carriage and irrationally\
  \ threw all my belongings on to the now moving train. With a further train signal\
  \ bellowing across the platform, it sent my body into adrenalin override. Within\
  \ moments I\u2019d sprinted the length of the platform, to an open carriage door\
  \ and in spotting the inspector inside, hurled my body through the air like I was\
  \ superman and dived into the carriage. \nThe poor inspector didn\u2019t know what\
  \ hit him, as he opened his eyes to a trembling girl on top of him. My immediate\
  \ response, Ba\xF1o (meaning toilet) as after all those hours the body could finally\
  \ relax. He quickly ushered me into the nearest toilet and that\u2019s where I started\
  \ to process exactly what I had accomplished. After composing myself somewhat I\
  \ explained to the inspector that I didn\u2019t have a train ticket, he looked at\
  \ me like I was crazy (which is fair, given he\u2019d seen me jump onto a moving\
  \ train). We exchanged money and he found me a comfy seat, blanket and signalled\
  \ me to get some sleep.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d made it. My heart was\
  \ still racing. I thought back on everything that brought me to this point, smiled\
  \ and sent Aaron a text saying I had his passport and the time I\u2019d arrive at\
  \ Uyuni station. As I curled up in my blanket I peacefully closed my eyes and thought,\
  \ Salt Flats here I come, knowing I\u2019d sleep most if not the entire seven-hour\
  \ train ride."
