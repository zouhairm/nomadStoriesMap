Text: "The call came just as I had finished work. \nThe call that I didn't realise\
  \ at the time would change my trip and the way I experienced everything for that\
  \ July in Sri Lanka. \nWith dads finger degloved and not fit for kiting, after a\
  \ kiting accident at the local spot (pretty ironic), I would head to Sri Lanka alone.\
  \ Our father daughter trip was off but there was no way I was going to pull out\
  \ of this trip. Hence how myself and roughly 15 other Australians found ourselves\
  \ loading baggage into buses in the stinking heat, ready for the 7 hour bus ride\
  \ ahead. \nMannar was our destination, and the videos on youtube had given me rather\
  \ high expectations, coupled with a twinge of nervousness after hearing that neighbours\
  \ had taken a bulldozer to the companies last kitesurfing resort, hence why the\
  \ Mannar resort had been built. Surely this was not a usual occurrence? \nIt is\
  \ hard when you arrive somewhere at night, the desire to go see everything then\
  \ and there is absolutely present, although the dark veil the sky draws tends to\
  \ disrupt this yearning and you are left to imagine the goings on around you. Our\
  \ first glimpses at life in Sri Lanka were people selling fruit at their roadside\
  \ stands and odd flashing moments that felt like dreams where at 3am street-lamps\
  \ lit up people raking their driveways and the roadside. I still wonder about this.\
  \ Arriving at roughly 8am, we unloaded and took in the incredible resort before\
  \ us, and the wide smiles greeting us. \nAs much as I was ready to get stuck in,\
  \ I was not expecting that less than an hour later we would be out on the water.\
  \ As a learner kiter, the lack of skills and lack of sleep i possessed definitely\
  \ ate at my nerves, as my stomach full of butterflies bumped around in the back\
  \ of the tractor on the way to the lagoon. \nAfter a lesson and some encouraging\
  \ words I was still nervous as hell, but had survived my first session on the water!\
  \ The feeling of being absolutely drained while being so energised from the fact\
  \ that I was there was an interesting combination, and wiped me out rather early\
  \ that night. The following days would be spent riding and learning, and eating\
  \ with fellow travellers/kite-surfers as well as the amazing staff in the open and\
  \ relaxed beach lounge. Something that often made me chuckle was the obvious juxtaposition\
  \ between the kite-surfers and the few people there to bird watch. It was as I said,\
  \ very obvious who was who. \nPersonally, the biggest thing I gained from this trip\
  \ was confidence. This came from many aspects of the trip and my experiences including\
  \ learning a new skill, talking to more people, travelling 'alone' for the first\
  \ time and the support of the staff. But I think it this was mostly due to the local\
  \ staff. These staff worked in the kitchen and the accommodation, and at the forefront\
  \ of the action, at the lagoon. It was a sight to see, the makeshift shelter erected\
  \ from driftwood to ward off the sun and the bustle of people running around, eager\
  \ to get out there. My first session alone, outside of a lesson was extremely daunting\
  \ and the smile and laugh of Thilak and Roy, a boy working to support his family,\
  \ meant so incredibly much. The moments where I needed a break from kiting I looked\
  \ forward to, as I got to spend time with them joking in the shade. And boy, I have\
  \ never met funnier people. I have never felt more comfortable and more included\
  \ right off the bat. I got to learn parts of a new language, for all the important\
  \ things in life; food, drive the tractor, and most importantly make new friends.\
  \ I was the youngest, most inexperienced, but I believe that kindness and consideration\
  \ (which is something I strive to be everyday) will get you so far with people,\
  \ and the respect and interest into another's culture is so important when making\
  \ real connections. They were the best two weeks of my life."
