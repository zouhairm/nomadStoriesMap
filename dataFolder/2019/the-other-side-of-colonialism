Text: "\u201CGive me your hand. You don\u2019t need to be scared.\u201D \nRichmond,\
  \ the man I had just met, held out his hand to me with a bright smile. We stood\
  \ at the opening of a pitch-black stone cave which two hundred years earlier was\
  \ filled with tightly packed bodies waiting to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean\
  \ to a new world. I took his hand and we walked together into the slave dungeon\
  \ of the old colonial castle in Cape Coast, Ghana. \nThe British lived in this castle,\
  \ isolated from the native Africans in town. Richmond led me upstairs to the now\
  \ uninhabited spacious rooms where the white governors used to live, work and go\
  \ to church. All while down below in the dungeons people suffocated from lack of\
  \ air, food and sanitation in the hot dry season as they waited for their unknown\
  \ fate. \nHe described to me how the British colonial leaders in coastal towns like\
  \ Cape Coast would send slave catchers deeper into the African continent to capture\
  \ people to be forcefully shipped to the Americas.  During colonial times, it wasn\u2019\
  t unusual to see slave catchers leading a solemn procession of people in chains\
  \ through the colorful and lively main streets of Cape Coast all the way to the\
  \ imposing white castle on the beach. \nRichmond recounted true stories of women\
  \ being raped while in captivity in the dungeons of this castle. As we stood in\
  \ the dank underground women\u2019s dungeon, he pointed to a crude wooden ladder\
  \ leading to a hole in the ceiling. He told me how the British governor would look\
  \ down at the captive, starving women and choose one. He would invite her to come\
  \ upstairs and offer her food, a bath, clothing. He would rape her and eventually\
  \ send her back down to the dark and crowded dungeon. \nAny babies born from these\
  \ affairs, the children of the British governors, would be taken away from them\
  \ and educated in the Church-run school inside of the castle with other British\
  \ children. The woman would be put on the slave ship with the rest of the captives,\
  \ never to see her child again. \nIn Cape Coast, I lived with a batiker named Betty\
  \ and her three children: Ewuraefua, Nanaadjua and Yooku. Betty is proud of her\
  \ Ghanaian heritage, so much so that she did not give her children English names.\
  \ Most people in Cape Coast have a Fante name, which is based on the day of the\
  \ week they were born and used in informal situations. Usually parents also give\
  \ their children an English name to be used at school, work and in other formal\
  \ situations. This is a relic of colonialism which Betty refused to pass on to her\
  \ kids. \nOn the small covered porch behind her house, Betty taught me how to laugh\
  \ hard, batik fabric, pound fufu and wash the laundry by hand in a bucket. Everybody,\
  \ including me, dressed up in brightly colored African textiles to go the Methodist\
  \ church each Sunday and sit in the hot sun while a preacher yelled in Fante and\
  \ people danced up to the altar to give donations. I spent both Valentine\u2019\
  s Day and my twentieth birthday in that church.\nReligion was used as a tool by\
  \ the British to keep the native populations of colonial territories under control.\
  \ As I rode from Accra to the Krobo region in an old half-broken-down van converted\
  \ into a cross-country public bus, my ears were assaulted throughout the entire\
  \ journey by an American Bible-belt preacher with a strong Alabama accent blasting\
  \ at top volume on the radio. Although it may seem incongruent, this type of evangelism\
  \ is strongly present in Ghana. Along the road it\u2019s not uncommon to see billboards\
  \ with the faces of preachers and \u201Cprophets\u201D plastered on them or huge\
  \ Jehovah\u2019s Witness compounds closed in by barbed-wire fences. \nI went to\
  \ Ghana to learn about batik textiles, meet its famously happy and welcoming local\
  \ people, and see Africa for the first time. Ghana met and exceeded all my expectations.\
  \ What I didn\u2019t expect was that I would leave with a more complex understanding\
  \ of the history of colonialism, slavery and racism than I could have imagined."
