Text: "Before flying to Singapore i knew nothing about the history or culture. I was\
  \ totally going into this Country blind and i couldn't have fallen in love with\
  \ a place more.\nSingapore truly has it all, there's this unique balance of everything\
  \ you could ever want. It\u2019s got the hustle and bustle of the city, the immense\
  \ culture, the food, the beaches, and of course the jungle. Each place i visited\
  \ felt completely different to the last and no one was better compared to the other,\
  \ just different. It was something else.\n\nThe first place i went to is Raffles\
  \ Hotel. Raffles is where the iconic cocktail the Singapore sling was created in\
  \ 1915 by a barman named Ngiam Tong Boon. Back then due to British customs women\
  \ weren't allowed to drink in public and so it was created as a way to hide alcohol.\n\
  Entering the bar is like stepping back in time and the atmosphere was very pleasing.\
  \ I got the impression from just my short visitation that the locals and tourists\
  \ clearly enjoy everything about it.\nThe cocktail itself was delicious and might\
  \ just be my new favourite but what was really enjoyable is the whole experience.\
  \ Whilst you have a drink in the iconic long bar. each table is given a bag of Monkey\
  \ nuts that you are welcome to enjoy, instead of being given a bowl for the shells\
  \ you are encouraged o just throw them on the floor just as the affluent men would\
  \ have done all those years ago.\_ \n\nFrom this i ventured on to Haji Lane and\
  \ Arab Street. Both were so vibrant and eclectic. Restaurants, boutiques and fabric\
  \ stalls lined the streets, every shop so different to the last and a different\
  \ colour too. Every inch of wall was either laden with exotic greenery or painted\
  \ on them the most magnificent murals, definitely a must see!\n\nOne of my favourite\
  \ places i visited was JUMBO, a restaurant in Dempsey Hill which\_\nspecialises\
  \ in a Singaporean classic. Chilli Crab! I went for dinner here one night and\n\
  it was absolutely delicious, we were served a big pot of Cracked crab with a spicy\
  \ sweet sauce.\nEveryone is given these bibs to wear (i know how flattering!) as\
  \ you are encouraged to get down and dirty, use your fingers and just enjoy the\
  \ whole experience. If anyone visits Singapore this is what i recommend doing the\
  \ most!!\n\nI took an afternoon to go to Sentosa island and visited Tanjong Beach.\
  \ Although the beach is man-made it is truly stunning and you could easily imagine\
  \ being on a beach in the Med, the sand is super soft, the water clear and beach\
  \ lined with loungers. The cove looks out onto the ocean which is dotted with container\
  \ ships which reminds you just where you are. A remarkable paradise. Something you\
  \ truly wouldn\u2019t expect to find in this ever surprising Country.\n\nI had the\
  \ opportunity to experience riding in the jungle one morning. Thats the thing about\
  \ Singapore you can transition from skyscrapers in the city to acres of greenery\
  \ in the jungle within a 10 minute drive. I had a great time and it was so different\
  \ from any riding i have every done before.\_\n\nOn one day i ventured into China\
  \ Town. The hustle and bustle of stalls, eateries, gift shops, tourists and locals\
  \ is enough to put anyone off even attempting to walk down the busy streets but\
  \ I promise you it is all worth it. I experienced some authentic Chinese street\
  \ food which was delicious and i just wandered from alley to alley in my own time.\_\
  \n\nI had a great time in Singapore and there's so much more I could write about\
  \ such as the botanical gardens which were so peaceful and incredibly well maintained;\
  \ The Singapore National Museum; which is where I learnt so much about Singapore's\
  \ history that i didn't know before.\nSingapore is so multicultural theres something\
  \ for everyone and i think thats what makes it so enjoyable to visit. It is a very\
  \ special, unique place and what i experienced i didn't expect to be anything close\
  \ to the reality that it was."
