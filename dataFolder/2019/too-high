Text: "I was at five thousand metres above sea level, when I realised I hadn't done\
  \ this before. It was October 2018, myself and James, an Englishman I'd met in Columbia\
  \ the year prior, decided to walk the Annapurna circuit in Nepal. I had plenteous\
  \ hiking experience, James had zero. Therefor between us I was the more experienced\
  \ one. James and myself made the regrettable decision to complete the trail unassisted,\
  \ no porters, no guide. I was confident in my ability and quite frankly we were\
  \ on a budget. \nPokhara was our first stop, we purchased our genuine fake hiking\
  \ equipment. Then began our journey via local bus and jeep, to the quint village\
  \ of Syange. The safe arrival to Syange, allowed us both to breath easy, after the\
  \ harrowing jeep ride. Cliff face to the left and a sheer drop off on the right.\
  \ I found myself grappling the edge of my seat for the entire two hours. \nOne week\
  \ in, the hike was going fantastic. A new mad French friend; Gill was as thin as\
  \ a rake, smoked like a chimney and told the most alluring stories. A loveable creature\
  \ who became a memorable part of our journey. \nThe first challenge for me came\
  \ when we decided to do a side trek to the famous lake Tilicho lake, 4920metres\
  \ above sea level. The arrival to Tilicho base camp was an unforgettable ordeal.\
  \ We walked for hours through landslides, it was icy, windy and on arrival we discovered\
  \ there was no accommodation left. If we wanted to complete the hike to Tilicho\
  \ lake the next morning, we needed to spend a night at base camp. \nJames, Gill\
  \ and I were among at least sixty others, who also didn't have a bed for the night.\
  \ At 4140metres above sea level, there was snow starting to settle on the vast valley\
  \ of loose stones. With no beds, silicon, negative five degree sleeping bags, genuine\
  \ fake North Face gear and a can do attitude, we started to anticipate the night\
  \ ahead. The staff at the lodges were thankfully prepared, they laid down thin mattresses,\
  \ on the dining room floor, for the sixty plus homeless sweaty hikers to roll out\
  \ their sleeping bags. \nJames and I ended up bunking in with some accommodating\
  \ Swedish girls, who had managed to arrive at 6am that day, to get a room. This\
  \ being the coldest night of both of our lives. The wind whistled up the cracked\
  \ floorboards as snow fell outside. Fed up with shaking for hours, we attempted\
  \ the climb to the lake at 4am. A few hiccups along the way meant we arrived to\
  \ the lake at noon. This was far later than expected, as I had my first bout of\
  \ altitude sickness. \nIgnoring the recommended \"descend slowly\" advice, James\
  \ and I ran back down to base camp, narrowly escaping the cold winds of Tilicho\
  \ lake. Both very happy to say, that was over.\nThe famous Thorong La pass at 5416metres\
  \ above sea level, was in our sights for the week ahead. Therefor we took a few\
  \ short days, to rest and prepare. The morning we planned to cross the pass, we\
  \ had reunited with Gill. At 4540metres he was still smoking like a chimney. It\
  \ was another 4am start, in order to beat the hazardous weather, that can arise\
  \ at the top. The three of us walked at the pace of my ninety year old Pa, until\
  \ I could walk no more. I was confused why the altitude was affecting me, more than\
  \ ever before. As I sipped my ginger tea with a Diamox, in a desperate attempt to\
  \ recover. A lovely Irish girl informed me that the Inca trail was only 4215metres\
  \ high. This meant I was nine hundred metres higher, and one hundred per cent more\
  \ decrepit. \nI now had three options, a piggy back from the chain smoking Frenchman,\
  \ a donkey ride for $200USD, or offload the contents of my pack to James, and walk\
  \ like a geriatric for the next kilometre, uphill. I took the third option.\nI then\
  \ went on to complete the circuit with a smile, calves of steel and a boyfriend.\
  \ Thanks Annapurna."
