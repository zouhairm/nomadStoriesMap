Text: "It's day 410 of my bicycle trip across the world. I wake up in my improvised\
  \ campsite in a little Croatian town, just a day's ride from Dubrovnik. I am gloriously\
  \ alone and all I see and hear is the Adriatic waters kissing the rocks on the coast.\
  \ Yes, I am a woman travelling alone on a bicycle. A prefer the term solo traveller,\
  \ though it doesn't always apply. During these last 14 months travelling the world,\
  \ I have met incredible people who have invariably inspired me with their lives\
  \ and stories. I've been fortunate to spend three minutes, hours, days or weeks\
  \ with these new friends that will stay in my life forever - like memories, or like\
  \ friends, but they will stay with me forever. \nYesterday, I said goodbye to Samu,\
  \ my three week cycling partner who is pedalling from Spain to Nepal to become a\
  \ Buddhist monk and leave all he's known behind. My eyes tear up thinking about\
  \ our time together. Samu is a veteran adventurer who has walked from Spain to Iran\
  \ twice and has explored untouched places, places most people would be afraid to\
  \ go to. He taught me what being a true adventure traveller means. He taught me\
  \ about slowing down, about dropping the kilometre count to instead, turn on my\
  \ senses to hear and experience beauty and love. About acceptance to experience\
  \ life as it comes, with its beauty at its pain, but without suffering, because\
  \ pain may be inevitable, but suffering is absolutely optional. He also taught me\
  \ about listening, about loving people,\_ situations and things for what they are.\
  \ \nSamu lost the ability to use his hand 22 years ago. And honestly, I hardly ever\
  \ noticed it. In fact, I am only telling this story because his passion for life\
  \ and drive might inspire someone reading these lines, as it inspired me.\_ Some\
  \ people would say he is disabled, but he is not! He is incredibly able! Samu has\
  \ done more and will do more than most people will ever do in their lives. I am\
  \ so incredibly grateful to have crossed his path! \nNow it's time to pack up my\
  \ tent and leave. Samu is headed to Greece, and me... I'm here, watching the waves\
  \ kiss the rocks."
