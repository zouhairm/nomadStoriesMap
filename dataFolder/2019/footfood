Text: 'I have been a very curious traveler since a long time and as I belong to an
  Indian family where my father expects me to be in a bank and work there but my ambition
  has always been to travel , meet new people and eat unique food of that particular
  place.

  So to get into the habit of traveling and finding my ownself I started my own food
  and travl blog page and started to travel my own country India. From the past 3
  or 4 years along with maintaining my studies  I have travelled to a lot of places
  in India and have had amazing food. For others traveling maybe just having fun and
  chill with friends and family but for me its finding peace in the chaos , exploring
  myself and living as I can hear my own breath. I love talking to new people , knowing
  about their life , what they do and how they live. As I travel I love each and every
  part of my traveling from going to bus stations to airports to railway stations
  to using random roadside washrooms , eating in roadside to high end places , etc.
  I love when I travel and I love what I do. Traveling is more than passion to me
  its like a drug which ironically doesn''t kill me but keeps me going.'
