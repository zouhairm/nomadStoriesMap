Text: "I\u2019m not as scared of spiders as I remembered, but of cockroaches? Yes!\
  \ They\u2019re both equally as erratic, but the difference is spiders are scared\
  \ of you too. You are likely to come across a spider or two at Mountain Mist. Fortunately,\
  \ no cockroaches. The mountains are mightily evident on arrival. The mist not so\
  \ much. A title merely due to an owner with a particularly peculiar partiality for\
  \ alliteration? Time will tell.\n\nWe are requested to bring a 2 litre Tab and pocket\
  \ of onions up the mountain, lest the owner not muster the motivation to make the\
  \ trek into town to get these amenities for herself before our arrival. A testament\
  \ to how far removed we will be. We\u2019re seeking escape after all. Tab for her\
  \ brandy cocktail. Onions hopefully not the garnish. It\u2019s the deep West Coast.\
  \ I\u2019ve seen stranger things. \n\nA wooden cabin with creaky floors. What is\
  \ it that\u2019s so comforting about that? I\u2019m still trying to figure it out.\
  \ But I think in this case it probably has something to do with the fact that you\
  \ have the opportunity to actually hear the squeaks and creaks. An infinite hum\
  \ of insects and secrets sent sailing through the trees. Simultaneously, a kind\
  \ of endless silence. It makes me wonder about the squeaks and creaks I may be missing\
  \ daily. In my kitchen cupboards. My bathroom door. Or, you know, my life. \n\n\
  I like the way warm rocks rise to meet the arches of my feet here. Even more so\
  \ when I lie down to watch the sunset and they meet the arch of my spine. The earth\
  \ has your back. Isn\u2019t it wild how watching the sun disappear behind the horizon\
  \ is like watching the last few grains of sand in the hourglass that is a day in\
  \ life slip away? I find that both deliciously satisfying and painfully terrifying.\
  \ But also strange that I\u2019ve never had the clarity of mind to appreciate the\
  \ obviousness of this sentiment until now.\n\nThe setting sun illuminates the passing\
  \ mountain mist. I get it now. Not just a futile alliteration after all. All spectrums\
  \ of gold punctuated with moody hues of bruised blue. Like a battered overripe peach\
  \ smeared across the sky. A pixelated orange orbed sun. The type I\u2019ve only\
  \ seen in travel photos from the likes of the Serengeti, and wondered if they just\
  \ have their own kind of sun there. Watering eyes from a gentle whisper off the\
  \ cliffs. An unwillingness to bat an eyelid and miss the sun sneakily slip behind\
  \ the horizon. Paper thin pale pink flowers lit up like Chinese lanterns. Golden\
  \ reeds ablaze with illumination\n\nGravity defying black and orange rock formations\
  \ like a prehistoric baby dinosaur left its Lego block creations out to calcify\
  \ for the rest of time. A breeze cool enough to offer comfort from the heat. Sunshine\
  \ warm enough to be thankful for the breeze. A cold condensation covered bottle\
  \ of beer that\u2019s quickly turned matte and finger-marked with heat. \n\nA robust\
  \ rusted outdoor bathtub with a starkly contrasted sparkling white porcelain interior.\
  \ No plumbing save for a hose pipe ten metres around the corner. No hot water. Dried\
  \ leaves and dying proteas an unavoidable bath time salve shaken loose from the\
  \ overhanging trees. Cheesy Roman-style cement pillar at its side, the perfect prop\
  \ for a drink. Made cheesier still with DIY glitter painted decoration. But somehow\
  \ also all the more charming. \n\nA warm windy day that feels like several. The\
  \ knowledge that here, I\u2019m utterly insignificant. \nI notice that the dead\
  \ proteas from the cabin\u2019s surrounding trees are just as mesmerising as alive\
  \ ones. Maybe even more so. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a meaningful metaphor there,\
  \ but I\u2019m just too lazy to extrapolate. My beer is getting warm and I need\
  \ to gulp it down quickly. Who would\u2019ve thought you could get so lost at home."
