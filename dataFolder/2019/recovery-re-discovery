Text: "My travel story is going to be about my journey navigating through this new\
  \ life of mine. Rewind five years into the past, I was homeless, broke, and hopeless.\
  \ Coming from a family filled with substance use disorder, and as they say \u201C\
  The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree.\u201D Now as I sit here today writing\
  \ this, I am no longer hopeless, I am no longer hopelessly dependent apon any substance\
  \ to bring me joy, or to fill a void in my soul. I have been on a journey of re-discovery,\
  \ finding out who I truly am. Now I\u2019m trying to start up my own production\
  \ company to in hopes that one day it can be a successful business. As I have found\
  \ a passion for photography, finding these activities that bring me joy is essential\
  \ to me finding joy in life!\nSo essentially my story would be sharing a message\
  \ of hope. I have found another passion of mine, and that\u2019s helping others.\
  \ Even if it\u2019s something as simple as smiling at a stranger, to starting my\
  \ own homeless outreach program through the company I work for. (Greener Pastures)\
  \ I just want to be of service to my fellow humans. Bringing my self out of the\
  \ dark and now seeing the light, I know that it\u2019s now my job in life to help\
  \ guide others out of the darkness. I haven\u2019t ever been able to travel, probably\
  \ never will be able too. If I was to get this opportunity I would be forever grateful.\
  \ You would make a guys dream of being able to travel, take pictures and write.\
  \ \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this! \U0001F64F\nHave a great day,\n\
