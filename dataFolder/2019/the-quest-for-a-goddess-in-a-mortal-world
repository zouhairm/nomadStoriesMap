Text: "First time I travel to Nepal I was curious to experience some of the festivities\
  \ that were made around Kumaris, as my arrival was in September and according to\
  \ the calendar these celebrations take place precisely in this month. People tried\
  \ to explain me which were the rites involving this tradition, and mostly I learned\
  \ the importance of being chosen a Kumari or living goddess. In brief, there is\
  \ a whole long process which has to be made by some kind of priests, whose work\
  \ mostly is to find among certain number of candidates -girls from 4 to 7 years\
  \ old- the avatar on earth for the goddess Durga. After a careful examination of\
  \ 32 principles of perfection that a girl must fulfill in this matter, the lucky\
  \ child will be taken care of, to the minuscule aspects of her life, and of course,\
  \ she would be treated like a goddess. To my surprise, taking this position requires\
  \ of a girl that age to witness the sacrifice ceremony of 108 buffalo to the goddess\
  \ Kali, and stay in complete calmness while they chopped the buffalo\xB4s heads\
  \ off as a symbol of fearlessness. She will assume this position until she becomes\
  \ a teenager and will be dismissed around her twelve birthday, with the coming of\
  \ her first period. Life after that would be of loneliness, as it is known a sign\
  \ of bad luck to marry an ex-Kumari.\nMaking your way through the narrow streets\
  \ of Thamel can be the most colorful adventure ever. Thamel is the most visited\
  \ neighborhood in Katmand\xFA, and the meeting point of people from almost all nationalities,\
  \ besides being full of small businesses selling from old nepalese prayer wheels,\
  \ to furry yak charms clung to scarves and bags. In trying to find the Kumari Temple,\
  \ I found an orange and navy blue elephant-designed skirt, Buda statues, cashmere\
  \ sweaters and gloves; pants, shoes and hand-crafted caps, all imprinted with the\
  \ pleasing \u201Cnepalese touch\u201D. As a business area, there are also restaurants\
  \ of all kinds of food; the \u201Ctacos\u201D of the Texan-Mexican place, amazingly\
  \ taste the same in this part of the world \u2013unexpected. Funny how, despite\
  \ my best efforts to get information from the locals and getting back in track to\
  \ the museum-temple, I found myself in the most enigmatic bookstore. Not only millions\
  \ of books from the Himalayas or about paragliding were on display, but there were\
  \ five different editions of the Gita, six different from Shakespeare's complete\
  \ works, and plenty of African art, besides selling toothpaste, henna, makeup, keychains\
  \ and tea. One place in a million.\nSo, after walking for maybe half an hour, carrying\
  \ some books, and a gorgeous mendhi in my hand, I was a little hopeless. The temple\
  \ was nowhere to be found and no one seemed to know about it. In my mind I was comparing\
  \ how foreigners in my country keep asking for places that even as a local I wasn\u2019\
  t aware of; markets full of crafts and secret parks or alleys can cause a huge impression\
  \ on alien visitors.\nWhen I reached the \u201Cmain square\u201D around the Kumari\
  \ temple, I found three pyramid-like houses surrounding the museum. I climbed one\
  \ of them and was completely seized by the view. The huge property in front of me\
  \ was in absolute peace. Not a soul could be seen through the twenty open windows,\
  \ except some far movement in the courtyard. In entering the museum, I found the\
  \ explanation of this tradition on the wall and the staff enlarging my story. I\
  \ dreamed of meeting her in person; at least to see her through her chamber window,\
  \ carried by people avoiding her to touch the \u201Cimpure ground\u201D. \nBut what\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to find was a normal Sunday afternoon; a boy was kissing\
  \ a girl in the plaza, women and their children buying ice cream, none of them caring\
  \ about my luck, or Kumaris\u2019 luck. I tried to concentrate again. How would\
  \ someone react if chosen a Kumari? Truth is, I was discovering a link between the\
  \ known and the unknown, between me and the gods, between me and Nepal."
