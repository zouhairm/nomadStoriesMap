Text: "After the very long flight delay I have had, finally the plane landed in Stuttgart,\
  \ the sky was immensely clear and the heat hit me, I collected my bags and the only\
  \ thing I\u2019ve knew was that I had to take the ICE train to Gotha in less than\
  \ an hour and that I had no idea where to start. An employee at the Airport somewhat\
  \ guided me to the place where I should go first and which took nearly forty-five\
  \ minutes to get there by the bus. The train station was huge, not at all as I\u2019\
  ve expected, I kept walking without any sure direction, I asked a few people but\
  \ apparently they didn\u2019t know either where to head, I started to have a sort\
  \ of anxiety when it occurred to me that only fifteen minutes left to go and thankfully\
  \ and lastly two teenage boys were able to help me, they had the Skater style and\
  \ could not speak English, one of them gesticulated to follow him after I\u2019\
  ve showed the ticket and the other helped me with the bags, we kept running silently\
  \ for a good while and suddenly one of them stopped and jerked his thumb toward\
  \ a white, huge train, I waved quickly at them, thanked them in German and the moment\
  \ I stepped inside the door closed behind me.\nAfter a whole day of travelling,\
  \ July 1st, a sunny Sunday morning in Muhlhausen, I opened my eyes and for the first\
  \ time found myself in the middle of nowhere, breakfast was served with pancakes,\
  \ fruits and tea from Sarah. Even though the journey had fatigued me, I haven\u2019\
  t felt that power inside of me for ages. Sarah had a serene energy I observed from\
  \ the start, she started a summer job at McDonald\u2019s and rode nearly thirty\
  \ minutes by bike. She always had a morning shift, so every day after breakfast\
  \ I would get an urge to go and tour the city, I would get on the bike and head\
  \ anywhere, the fact that I became indolent the past two years, I was genuinely\
  \ enjoying the vivacity that had gripped me and even though I haven\u2019t ridden\
  \ a bike since 9th grade and that one morning I fell real bad and almost got hit\
  \ by the car, I was truly delighted by every event that was happening in my life.\n\
  \ Muhlhausen is a small city in Thuringia, I was astonished by the architecture\
  \ of the city, the old buildings blended well with interesting designs and vivid\
  \ colors, the city had a structure and nothing leaned out of that, as much as I\u2019\
  ve liked it, I was many times bewildered and lost my way home nor could I go to\
  \ McDonald\u2019s to find Sarah, but I guess I was always bad with direction and\
  \ still am. The majority of inhabitants were middle aged and then a portion of teens,\
  \ everybody knew each other, and if you stayed more than two hours in the square\
  \ and the center, every face around you was familiar. I caught the locals\u2019\
  \ attention all the time, they weren\u2019t used to get visited by an outsider and\
  \ the most common question I got was how why this city. There wasn\u2019t much to\
  \ do, every Friday, people would gather at someone\u2019s house, light a fire, some\
  \ snacks and beers, I liked the simplicity, after some hours they would all get\
  \ in the mood of dancing and laughing together, I\u2019ve learned as well some of\
  \ their dance moves and some patriotic songs, and other times, Sarah\u2019s friends\
  \ would come over and we would play games like \u2018 truth or dare\u2019 while\
  \ waiting for her to finish her shift and then we would all drive to Erfurt or Eisenach\
  \ and come back after midnight. \nThat summer was nothing what my peers would envy\
  \ me, nor what people my age like to call wild and crazy, but it will always be\
  \ unforgettable in its way. Never thought that I can be strong, confident and doing\
  \ just alright until I\u2019ve put myself out there in front of the world. It was\
  \ a process of exploring the inner and a progress of self- love."
