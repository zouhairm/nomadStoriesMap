Text: "It was 4:30 when we pulled out of the garage of my parent\u2019s house. It\
  \ was still dark, the only light in the driveway coming from the porch light. It\
  \ was replaced for a moment with my headlights before we drove away. Despite knowing\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t see the sights of my hometown for another month I didn\u2019t\
  \ pause to take them in.\nThe hours leading up to my first solo flight were similar\
  \ to the way I felt the summer before starting university. I reveled in the suspense\
  \ of not knowing what the rest of my life would look like after a specific time.\n\
  I had my first glimpse of Missouri from the window seat of the plane. Having lived\
  \ in California my whole life I expected the dry brown hills I left behind and I\
  \ wasn\u2019t expecting to see so many bright green trees during our descent.\n\
  I was reminded of the first week of college when a girl in commented how beautiful\
  \ San Luis Obispo was. I asked how she could say that when she was from Hawaii,\
  \ one of the most beautiful places I had ever been.\n\u201CIt\u2019s a different\
  \ kind of beauty,\u201D she had said. I finally understood the way she felt as I\
  \ looked out the airplane window.\nThe first sight of my potential new home was\
  \ a positive one but I was unsure of what was to follow. I had been told for weeks\
  \ to brace for the heat and humidity. But surprisingly when I went outside I found\
  \ it was no worse than Bay Area summers. I had been expecting Florida levels of\
  \ humidity, the air so thick I could barely breathe. It had been my first encounter\
  \ with Florida, immediately making me certain I never wanted to move there. And\
  \ yet I had partially committed to living in Missouri, somewhere I had never been\
  \ before that day. I wanted to like it but I was worried something would make up\
  \ my mind for me. Like weather or desolation.\nI was picked up at St. Louis International\
  \ Airport by my boyfriend. We had met two years before through our college\u2019\
  s Facebook rideshare group. He had picked me up 30 minutes outside my hometown to\
  \ carpool us 4 hours south to go back to school. For five minutes I knew him as\
  \ a resident of California until he revealed he had been visiting his grandparents\
  \ and was actually from a small town outside St. Louis. At the time the most I knew\
  \ about Missouri was it was located in the Midwest and there wasn\u2019t much there.\n\
  This was confirmed for me as I looked out at the endless stretch of freeway while\
  \ he told me most of the residential areas of the state lined the highway. The rest\
  \ was untouched land.\nThere was a different type of remoteness present here than\
  \ there was in central California but as I looked at the trees lining the highway\
  \ it didn\u2019t feel quite as empty. \nI felt like an outsider many times in the\
  \ next month. My boyfriend was at ease having lived there his entire life while\
  \ I was asked by everyone I met how it was here compared to California, a constant\
  \ reminder I was a stranger here. I wasn\u2019t in a truly foreign place, after\
  \ all I was only a few states away but I might as well have been.\nThe few moments\
  \ I reflected on how I felt there was in the mornings outside on the back porch\
  \ looking at the view of the lake behind their house. It was the closest I felt\
  \ to California. Here there were no hills or bodies of water but back home I was\
  \ used to living at most half an hour away from the water and facing the hillside.\
  \ I was worried that I would never live near the water again but then I found out\
  \ his parents lived on a lake.\nIt wasn\u2019t the same but it was enough. I couldn\u2019\
  t quite see myself here yet but I also liked what I saw enough to stay."
