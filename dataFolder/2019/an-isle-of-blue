Text: "She was one of my favorite friends from my childhood. Always daring and full\
  \ of adventure, her outlook on life was remarkably riveting. I loved how she was\
  \ unapologetic in everything she did, despite the skeptical opinion of others. So\
  \ it came to no surprise that she announced that she was getting married at age\
  \ 18 and was being whisked away to a corner of the country that I had never even\
  \ heard of to be with her husband. I distinctly remember typing \"Friday Harbor,\
  \ WA\" in Google and educating myself about this newfound place. It was a town located\
  \ on an island off of the coast of Washington state. The San Juan islands, I learned,\
  \ was the name of both the group of islands that it was a part of and of the actual\
  \ island that the town was located on. I was struck with intrigue, so three years\
  \ later I decided to venture out to visit. \n\nI flew into Seattle with bolts of\
  \ excitement surging through me, I didn't know what to expect. My friend met me\
  \ at the airport and we drove an hour and a half northwest to a town called Anacortes.\
  \ The scenery on the way was unreal. The snow cap mountains against the sapphire\
  \ sky had me plastered to the window; the vast space and grandeur was incredibly\
  \ overwhelming for this Chicago-native. We arrived at a ferry port in Anacortes\
  \ and had to wait about 30 minuets until the next departure for our destination.\
  \ There was one ginormous mountain governing a lake that was right next to the port.\
  \ My friend and I walked around the lake and on the rocks that were beside it. \n\
  \nAs departure time was nearing, my friend and I got into her car and drove onto\
  \ the ferry. She parked and we went to upper deck where the passengers could sit\
  \ and relax. There was one long window almost stretching the entire perimeter of\
  \ ferry to host the vivacious display. I peered out onto the carpet of water with\
  \ various mounds of land poking out of it. It was daunting yet stunning. After an\
  \ hour-long ferry ride, we finally pulled into the dock at Friday Harbor! It was\
  \ such a quaint and serene town that gave me a very home style vibe.\n \nThe next\
  \ few days were spent exploring all that the island had to offer. My friend and\
  \ I went hiking in what could have easily been an enchanted forest. The pine trees\
  \ were majestic and tapped the sky. There was a unique stillness that settled in\
  \ the further we went. Chipmunks scurried along our path as birds echoed each other.\
  \ The air was fresh and filled with euphoria. Then we went down to a popular harbor\
  \ for tourists and walked up and down the docks until the sun went down. \n\nThe\
  \ next day we went to a beach and I was absolutely floored by the way the way the\
  \ water swept against the sky. It was an isle of blue. The interplay between the\
  \ shades of blue and the golden sun rays were timeless. We walked along the coast\
  \ and posed on huge rocks and found massive legs of seaweed, there were more miniture\
  \ rocks than sand and I felt like I was on the shores of Scotland or Ireland. It\
  \ was magical. \n\nI never imaged that trip would turn out the way that it did.\
  \ It was a complete surprise. San Juan Island is easily one of the most exquisite\
  \ places in the US that I have visited. And I never would have known about it if\
  \ it wasn't for my sweet friend. Her little nook of the country totally swept me\
  \ off of my feet!"
