Text: "It's not too difficult to understand the economics of tourism. Rich people\
  \ visit. You smile for them. They leave money. But it wasn\u2019t like that in Cambodia.\
  \ It's not that the Cambodian people didn't smile or weren't genuinely helpful,\
  \ it's just they didn't seem to care if you visited or not. There was no endless\
  \ feedback loop. No restaurant wanted me to Yelp them. Most of the time I felt invisible.\
  \ The Cambodian's are gracious and accepting because that's who they are, but they\u2019\
  re not salacious.\n\nThe flip side is there is no better way to embrace an authentic\
  \ cultural experience than wrapped in a cloak of invisibility. Tourism is hard on\
  \ culture. I don't blame the French for trying to keep English slang out of their\
  \ language. The Cambodian people have already lost so much and now China is buying\
  \ up the rest. Cambodians adorn their babies with gold jewelry because they don't\
  \ trust banks and besides, who would steal from a baby. They own what they own because\
  \ that\u2019s all that there is left. \n\nCambodia is a youthful culture. There\
  \ are almost twice as many children under 15 in Cambodia compared to the US. But\
  \ Cambodia isn\u2019t ready for you if you\u2019re old. City streets have death-defying\
  \ crosswalks\u2014heck, our two-story villa, with its ladder-steep stairway and\
  \ no railing alone would preclude many. When I asked the DJ to play some 80\u2019\
  s pop music in the club last night, the teen-ager looked at me like I was a dotty\
  \ old man requesting Lawrence Welk.\n\nWe toured the countryside where most people\
  \ are rice farmers or fishermen or both. Fish provides 2/3 of an average family\u2019\
  s protein. Our guide taught me how to fish with a net from shore.  You draped it\
  \ around your shoulder like a cape and gathered each fold with your fingers. Like\
  \ a discus thrower, your un-coil, spin and throw all in one motion. If you did it\
  \ right, the net spreads open in a great circle as the weights in the hem hit the\
  \ water first. All I managed after a dozen tosses was a handful of two-inch minnows.\
  \ My guide graciously accepted them for his family\u2019s dinner. In the Mekong\
  \ river fishermen with stood in the brown water all day up to their necks, throwing\
  \ nets and casting dredging hooks for catfish. Some brought home less than the few\
  \ fish in my net.  \n\nThere are many types of rice raised in Cambodia. There is\
  \ a Khmer saying, \u201CThe offering rice for ghost sneers at the rice for the ancestors.\u201D\
  \ Meaning you use the less expensive rice to ward off bad spirits and save the good\
  \ stuff for your offering to your ancestors. Rice is a staple in their diet and\
  \ their culture. We relished much more than rice at mealtime. I especially liked\
  \ the chicken soup that they serve for breakfast and the stir-fries for dinner.\
  \ The fresh local ingredients like ginger and lemon grass have rainbow of subtleties\
  \ I never tasted back in Seattle. \n\nOk, so you want to know about eating insects.\
  \ My wife crunched down fried crickets, which are seasoned and eaten like potato\
  \ chips. Cambodians prepare many other insects too. At a stop along a dusty highway\
  \ I gave a woman a couple of bucks for a fried tarantula and a cold beer to wash\
  \ the thing down with. After I ate it, I was mildly chastised by our guides to more\
  \ carefully consider my food and drink purchases. And they were right. I mean a\
  \ dollar for a cold beer, fine, but a dollar for a fried spider too? Another tourist\
  \ ripped off abroad.  \n\nAnother omnipresent ingredient is Prahok. It\u2019s mudfish\
  \ that is fermented, salted and crushed into a smelly paste. Originally it was a\
  \ method for preservation. Our guides said next time I visit they are going to order\
  \ me a dish prepared wholly from prahok. Too much? Perhaps, but the Khmer have a\
  \ saying, \u201COnce you dip your hand into the prahok, then dip it up to the armpit.\u201D\
  \ \n\nAn offering of a bowl of prahok as incentive for my return; like I said, Cambodia\
  \ really doesn\u2019t care if you visit or not."
