Text: "Birthday Travel Expos\xE9\nJeremy Kyle Houston (USA)\n\nDearest,\n\nIt was\
  \ still dark when I boarded the 5 a.m. Aeromexico flight to Bogota.  I however was\
  \ full of light.  Hours before I had witnessed some my favorite DJs play sets at\
  \ Mexico City\u2019s Electric Daisy Carnival.  The atmosphere had been ideal.  I\
  \ had never attended a large-scale music festival before.  I sat on the plane recollecting\
  \ the anxiety I had months ago when deciding to book this trip.  The ecstasy-like\
  \ feeling I had now was the reward for pushing past those emotions and living outside\
  \ my comfort zone. Bogota would have more in store.  \n\nFrom the taxi, I assessed\
  \ Bogota to be a modern city cascading down a lush mountainside.  I settled into\
  \ my Airbnb and checked my WhatsApp.  In my opinion, one of the only negatives to\
  \ traveling solo is the roulette one plays with eco-tour operators.  They prefer\
  \ to take groups on excursions understandably.  Circumstances proved favorable as\
  \ Andes Eco Tours sent me a confirmation message.  The next day two Swedish tourists\
  \ and I traversed the bio-diverse Choachi mountains that dazzled our eyes with its\
  \ symphony of colors.  With our local guide Carlos, we foraged and explored the\
  \ paramos, a high-altitude ecosystem unique only to this region.  As the clouds\
  \ rolled in blanketing the landscape, we ended the tour at Carlos\u2019 aunt\u2019\
  s house toasting with fresh goat\u2019s milk the serene beauty we had just beheld.\
  \  Experiencing a natural environment like this was the top priority for me in Bogota.\
  \  Yet, more awaited as I descended.\n\nPrior to arrival, I had agreed to meet Miguel,\
  \ the owner of my Airbnb for a dinner.  He was tall and slight with black curly\
  \ hair.  He appeared sophisticated like a museum curator; and that happened to be\
  \ his profession.  We nourished ourselves with shrimp ceviche among other dishes\
  \ as we discussed variable topics.  He had just returned from Cartagena where he\
  \ was an extra in a Colombian beer commercial starring Chuck Norris.  Who would\
  \ have ever guessed Chuck Norris had that side gig?  After dinner we walked the\
  \ Macarena neighborhood and an undeniable chemistry kindled between us.  I accepted\
  \ the invitation into his home which was accented by stylish furnishings and quirky,\
  \ handmade ceramic birds.  I have a personal history with birds and perceived their\
  \ presence in the house as a queue for me to spread my wings and try to glide from\
  \ platonic into romantic love.  \u201CWhat happens now?\u201D I asked.  \u201CI\
  \ suppose I want to kiss you\u201D he replied.  So, I consented and nature took\
  \ a course ripe with honor and edification.\n\nThe next day Miguel moved me out\
  \ of the Airbnb and offered me a room at his place.  A stateside friend originally\
  \ from Bogota connected me to some locals who I met later that afternoon.  Maria\
  \ and I meandered an exotic fruit market where I was introduced to fluorescent colored\
  \ sweet granadillas, mangosteens, and pitayas.  We eventually met her husband, Roberto,\
  \ and proceed to enjoy my last night with an assortment of Colombian fare while\
  \ we mused A Course in Miracles.  Returning to Miguel\u2019s, I bought him a small,\
  \ yellow and blue dreamcatcher as a memento of the time we shared.  It would mingle\
  \ perfectly among the eclectic ornaments that adorned his house.  He appreciated\
  \ it.  \n\nI try to travel somewhere new in the world every year for my birthday.\
  \  It is becoming a little tradition, a tiny gift of self-care.  This trip from\
  \ Mexico City to Bogota exposed me to progressive music, pristine views, delicious\
  \ food, laughter, and best of all, a little love.  I wish nothing less for you my\
  \ friend. I believe you will find all this and more.  \n\nLeap into the unknown,\n\
  \nJ"
