Text: "I won random collectible cards of several famous players on my first plane\
  \ flight, gift from a traveling gringo (foreigner). The destination, an archipelago\
  \ famous for having served as inspiration for the book The Origin of the Species\
  \ by Charles Darwin: The Galapagos, a small part of Ecuador. Looking through the\
  \ window I saw the islands, from Isabela to San Crist\xF3bal, or so I thought. When\
  \ we landed, we went straight to the hotel, it looked like any coastal city but\
  \ life was way more expensive and much more for foreigners (all the people who did\
  \ not live on the islands). In one of the tours we went to a national reserve, there\
  \ I met the solitary George, the giant tortoise, years later his death would end\
  \ with a unique species of the planet, product of a historical event. During the\
  \ conquest, this animal had served as food for Europeans, too slow to flee it was\
  \ an easy hunt. The next day we went straight to the beach, transparent waters and\
  \ exotic animals filled my eyes, like the royal frigate with its striking red chest\
  \ or the marine iguanas resting on the rocks. In the afternoon, I saw several blue-footed\
  \ boobies standing on rocks looking directly at the sea and suddenly one flew away,\
  \ dipped his head in the water and the next second he had a fish in his beak, a\
  \ si ple actual that showed me, at nine years old, how ephemeral life can be, first\
  \ you are swimming calmly and suddenly you die. Those thoughts were turned off when\
  \ I saw the cracks of the island of Santa Cruz, where I swam for hours until my\
  \ fingers looked like raisins. During the trip, I could also see several sea lions.\
  \ But be careful becaouse they do not want you to play with their babies. I learned\
  \ that the bad way when I was almost attacked by one. At the time the beautiful\
  \ animal seemed giant and he attacked me, I was told, because I was too close to\
  \ their young , although in reality I was more than six meters away. The speed of\
  \ the animal flapping in the sand terrified me and I ran away, ending up falling\
  \ and scratching my leg. I had a reprimand from the tour guide who, after giving\
  \ me a band-aid, told me that it was dangerous to be so close to these animals when\
  \ they are parents. But the trauma disappeared the next day, I managed to make friends\
  \ with one of them who was swimming amicably around me.  As a reminder of my new\
  \ friend I brought an extremely expensive stuffed animal, with the shape of a sea\
  \ lion that during my adolescence I cared for, remembering that place magical that\
  \ I had visited. On the penultimate day of the trip, we went to a park where I could\
  \ see the Darwin's Finches and in the afternoon, when I returned to the hotel on\
  \ a raft, I could appreciate the wonderful view of dolphins jumping in front of\
  \ the sunset, typical of the Pacific coast. One of the best landscapes I've seen\
  \ in my life. However, my holidays were coming to an end. They had been very short,\
  \ I barely knew four of the dozens of islands in the archipelago. The last day was\
  \ the saddest, the previous afternoon I had packed all my clothes and we spent the\
  \ night walking by the boardwalk of the city. The last morning we did not have time\
  \ to go to the beach, the flight was going to leave before noon and we had to arrive\
  \ with an hour of antecedence to the place. At the airport I felt like seeing the\
  \ beach again, but I could not leave. At least, in the airport, I could go into\
  \ different stores and see cups, shirts, bags and key rings, all with references\
  \ to the archipelago. I was passionate about some bracelets, which in the next few\
  \ days I gave to my best friends while I told them about those animals and dazzling\
  \ landscapes I had seen. And they, both open-mouthed, put on their bracelets and\
  \ said repeatedly: we also want to go."
