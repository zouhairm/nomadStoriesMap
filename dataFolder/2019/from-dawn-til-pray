Text: "Six hours of torment were finally ending, culminating in a backpack crammed\
  \ with the experiences gathered through seven summer weeks of volunteering in Surakarta,\
  \ Indonesia. The project was over and my last few days at the tropical country would\
  \ be spent scuba diving in the unearthly waters off Weh Island, Aceh province. My\
  \ landlord, Pak Wiwit, a lean man of sound aspect and sincere smile, would bring\
  \ me to Surakarta\u2019s train station. As I went through my schedule one last time,\
  \ nostalgia invaded me for the room I\u2019d called home for seven weeks.\nRainbow-colored\
  \ seashells, captured in a road trip, were left behind. The last Mexican sweets,\
  \ brought overseas as offerings, didn\u2019t make it. A pan, a portable stove and\
  \ even a plastic-demijohn for purified water: all of these would settle with my\
  \ neighbor. \u201CI\u2019ll definitely miss you, but thanks for the free stuff,\
  \ amigo!\u201D he sang, hours before. Balancing the bag was difficult, its weight\
  \ competing with mine: I was as slim and swarthy as any Indonesian, able to camouflage\
  \ as a local for as long as my mouth remained shut.\nThe motorcycle\u2019s engine\
  \ roared one hour later. The dirt road fused with the avenue and the humid heat\
  \ felt chilly, hastened by the bike. Soon, I became mesmerized by the wind inflating\
  \ and deflating Wiwit\u2019s shirt. A humble sound started to reverberate throughout\
  \ the city: adhan, the call to worship, bursted through the loudspeakers of the\
  \ nearest mosque. The call to Fajr prayer, one of five daily adhan, is recited by\
  \ a muezzin in Arabic at every mosque after dawn; it\u2019s an unsettling experience\
  \ the first time, but you grow accustomed to it.\nI had never heard it while on\
  \ a motorcycle, though. I had not heard the call from its beginning, as it typically\
  \ woke me up during my last sleep cycle. More importantly, it never had the force\
  \ of that occasion on me, my last moment in Surakarta. One mosque near me chanted\
  \ adhan and another one did the same, far away. We hummed through a neighborhood\
  \ without red lights and every turn of the wheels met with a new adhan.\nHere I\
  \ was: an agnostic, an infidel, a pagan. Unable to speak Arabic or Indonesian, struggling\
  \ with an overstuffed backpack and sleep-deprived. Here, at the other side of the\
  \ world, I felt a million devoted souls, praying to the air: an entire city united\
  \ by dawn duty. A melody recurring a hundred times, exploding at every corner: every\
  \ wave of wind whirling through Wiwit\u2019s shirt was a call to prayer and every\
  \ breath I took was saturated of zeal. As a single tear glided through my left cheek,\
  \ I felt grateful for the unexpected event.\nI have always been an skeptic, valuing\
  \ rituals and religious activities for their cultural and historical significance.\
  \ In my native Mexico they\u2019ve become little more than a family burden, carried\
  \ over centuries of colonial rule, oftentimes hindering my fellow denizens from\
  \ realizing their full potential. But this time was different: adhan felt like the\
  \ possibility of connection with Others, the eagerness of starting a new day and\
  \ the necessity of garnering strength for what is to come. Something universal was\
  \ at play: the ritual, above its particularities\u2014adhan or bells tolling, Qur\u2019\
  an or Bible, Indonesia or Mexico\u2014exists to unite; never before I felt as close\
  \ to my faithful peers as in that motorcycle ride, hearing the call to pray.\nWe\
  \ arrived at the station a few minutes later, the last adhan fading in the warm\
  \ air. I wiped off my red eyes and pulled out the Mexican flag I saved for seven\
  \ weeks. Pak Wiwit took a long-split second to understand my gift, and I returned\
  \ his sincere smile with a hug. Tears piled up in my eyes; \u201Cgoodbye, friend\u201D\
  \ was said, and nothing was left unsaid."
