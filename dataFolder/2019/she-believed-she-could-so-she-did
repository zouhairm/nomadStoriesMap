Text: "Growing up a regular girl from a small city, life seemed to be all mapped out\
  \ for me already. Go to school, get a good job that takes up most of your time,\
  \ live to be good enough for a guy who hopefully falls in love with you Until you\
  \ get married and have kids with him then he realizes he can still step out and\
  \ have a family when he comes home. Well isn\u2019t life just great? I think not...\
  \ at a young age I realized I was too smart for that same old borrow repetition\
  \ and all the rules of people telling me how to live my life and how to make myself\
  \ happy. I stopped listening to all the noise and started listening to my heart.\
  \ With a risky mentality and a brave personally I couldn\u2019t say no to my opportunity\
  \ to fly out to Bahamas to enjoy the weekend with successful men and my girls cane\
  \ along with me. My perspective of living quickly changed. I was instantly intrigued\
  \ by the laid back personalities and the care free life style. Being on the water\
  \ everyday in the sun, having a butler, security , and a chef is exactly what living\
  \ life looks like to me. It was a set up for\nMe to never leave, I could have stayed\
  \ forever, changed my name and called it a day. Not only did the life style sweep\
  \ me away but the men certainly had their own way of welcoming me to the island\
  \ with their charming smiles and handsome looks. I had my eye on one in particular\
  \ but unfortunately not every king sees his queen laying in front of him immediately.\
  \ Let\u2019s just say the love notes were transported telephathically. Energy was\
  \ at its highest and I feel the ocean had something to do with it. The feeling of\
  \ paradise and never wanting to go \u201Chome\u201D or where we are told to call\
  \ home a place where we are stuck in a generic lifestyle where we aren\u2019t incoiraged\
  \ to be individuals, just another number or cubical. Being anywhere besides the\
  \ place I have been treated as a queen with beautiful weather, food, and people\
  \ seems to be prison in my mind. The adventures unfold through the stories are told,\
  \ we live in the cold but cry that we\u2019re old. I decide to live by design not\
  \ by default and where I can wish on something beautiful I will chase it through\
  \ the night until I am refused to do it."
