Text: "The city, if it could be called that, had hardly risen to the light of the\
  \ morning sun as the young boys jacked up the pickup truck to replace the tires.\
  \ As we stood outside the Ford F150, vagrant cats scrambled among the greasy spare\
  \ parts carefully propped against the side of the shack. Our teacher  caravan was\
  \ on a mission, headed to Incahuasi, house of the Incas, to deliver much needed\
  \ school supplies to the little ones. Local drivers were hired to maneuver over\
  \ the winding, railless, serpentine dirt roads. We were greeted at the elementary\
  \ school entrance by rosy faced children eager to see what we had in our bags. An\
  \ opening ceremony in Spanish was held as the students stood at attention to the\
  \ Peruvian flag flapping in the Andean breeze. No sooner had the speeches and traditional\
  \ dances finished than it was time for lunch.\n\nAs the guests of honor, we were\
  \ seated on wooden benches while our hosts sat across from us on the grass. As we\
  \ prepared to eat, hand-embroidered napkins were unfolded and our lunch was revealed\
  \ piecemeal. First, what I thought were boiled, white potatoes turned out to be\
  \ yucca. Next, there were mounds of fat kerneled corn to which I helped myself to\
  \ several cobs. Finally, to the spectators\u2019 delight, we moved onto the main\
  \ course.\nI tried to extrapolate from the clues what charbroiled piece of meat\
  \ lay in front of me. There was a an outburst of tremendous laughter from the women\
  \ as we surveyed the grilled specimen as though other outsiders had experienced\
  \ the same ritual of presentation and confusion. The flattened outline of an animal\
  \ was obvious, and there was a strange yet familiar silhouette to it. It was bigger\
  \ than a squirrel and smaller than an armadillo. A sudden flashback to my childhood\
  \ days made it all make sense. It was Charlie. Charlie was on my paper plate.\n\n\
  I didn\u2019t expect to find myself eating guinea pig, but I was surrounded by Quechua-speaking\
  \ women in large brimmed hats intently eyeballing my every move. They sat there\
  \ quietly swaddled in hand-woven ponchos with geometric shapes in hues of rich reds\
  \ and yellows. To not eat it, would be rude, and to not eat it as an American, the\
  \ rudest act of all, so I devised a strategy. With delicate movements, I pulled\
  \ off the rubbery skin to expose the edible meat. On a positive note, there was\
  \ not that much of it on the bone so it wouldn\u2019t take me long to finish as\
  \ long as the grease allowed me to hold it in my fingers and move it toward my mouth\
  \ without having to perform acrobatic feats. Unfortunately, that was not the case\
  \ as I moved it toward my lips and it slid out between my thumb and forefinger.\
  \ This of course brought on the laughter from the onlookers. As quickly as I could,\
  \ I picked apart the meat and tried to shove it in my mouth. It tasted like...you\
  \ guessed it, chicken! I was finished, or was I?\n\nNope. The last act, or should\
  \ I say course, was to wash everything down with a mouth scorching 160 proof sugar\
  \ cane alcohol shot commonly referred to as \u201CJohn K.\u201D While the women\
  \ were fixated on my eating Charlie, the men in their modern baseball caps and jeans\
  \ were intrigued by my drinking acuity. Boldly, I raised the paper cup in the air\
  \ and triumphantly shouted \u201CSalut.\u201D Hats came off and flapped violently\
  \ in the air in a show of solidarity. That\u2019s all I remember."
