Text: "The city of Bishkek boasts magnificent sights, culturally as well physically.\
  \ Walking through the city, one cannot help but travel through time and experience\
  \ history that still lives in the Kyrgyz people. Then Kyrgyz come from a nomadic\
  \ lifestyle. I was surprised to discover that there is such a thing as World Nomads\
  \ Games that Bishkek had hosted earlier that year. This is a sporting completion\
  \ sorely dedicated to ethnic sports practised in central Asia. Another aspect that\
  \ has survived through centuries and emanated from the nomadic lifestyle of their\
  \ ancestors is the \u2018yurt\u2019. A traditional yurt is a round tent covered\
  \ with skin and used as lodging in the plains of central Asia.\nIn a case of history\
  \ and culture meeting the modern era, Dasmia restaurant dome is designed as a huge\
  \ yurt. Intricate detail fills the whole area with artwork decorating the place.\
  \ The warmth that greeted me as I entered its doors struck me. It was such a contrast\
  \ to the outside weather, earlier; I had spent my afternoon tracking in at the beautiful\
  \ Ala-Archa Gorge with the snowcapped mountains surrounding the place, the people\
  \ that are so warm, inviting and friendly. The amazing food and general hospitality\
  \ was something I did not expect to find after a conversation I had had a few days\
  \ prior.\nI have to admit that prior to this trip; I had no knowledge of the country,\
  \ let alone know how to pronounce its name. That did not, however, stop the excitement\
  \ that was in me. I was so excited that I had spent a good amount of time since\
  \ I had known that I would be going there learning how to pronounce the name of\
  \ the country I was going to. I was not too sure, however, about my progress but\
  \ that wasn\u2019t going to stop me from saying it when I was asked by the gentleman\
  \ who did a pre-check of our documents before the check-in desk.  He asked us where\
  \ we were headed - I was with a companion \u2013 I jumped in to answer because I\
  \ did not trust that my companion had mastered the proper pronunciation. Yes, I\
  \ was that confident with those three weeks of constantly asking Google and the\
  \ occasional redirection to YouTube videos had paid off.\n\u2018\u2019Kyrgyzstan\u2019\
  \u2019, I told him with the slightest stammer \u2026 well, I did not want to seem\
  \ too corky to my companion, thinking I was way above him, so I had to inflect the\
  \ stammer for just that effect. He went on to ask casually what business we had\
  \ in Kyrgyzstan, I went on to say that we were just going there to; do some sightseeing.\
  \ This was not entirely true because we were actually going for a forum, but I wasn\u2019\
  t going to tell him that.  ` The gentlemen stopped looking down at the documents\
  \ and looked at us and asked something that has stuck to me since then. He said\
  \ \u2018\u2019 who goes sightseeing in Kyrgyzstan? It\u2019s just one of those countries\
  \ where there just isn\u2019t anything worth to see\u2019\u2019 he went on to say\
  \ that we were the first people he had come across who had told him such \u201C\
  shocking news\u2019\u2019. \nI have to admit that the way he said the name Kyrgyzstan,\
  \ with such confidence and without any hesitation whatsoever, like he had been saying\
  \ it since he was born made me almost believe him. I asked him if he had ever been\
  \ there. He said no, because like he had mentioned before, people just didn\u2019\
  t go there. My companion felt the need to tell him that the reason we were actually\
  \ going there that was actually going for a conference.  He said \u2018oh, that\
  \ makes sense\u2019\n\nI refuse to live with single stories as demonstrated by the\
  \ renowned author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie-  and untrue perceptions that people\
  \ have about other people. Dark clouds definitely exist, but in the words of Maya\
  \ Angelou; \u201Cbe the rainbow in someone\u2019s cloud \u2018\u2019. Always strive\
  \ to find the good in something or someone. In regards to my trip to Bishkek, I\
  \ did not have to do much to find \u2018the rainbow\u2019, the place and the people\
  \ there already are."
