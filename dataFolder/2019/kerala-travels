Text: "Unsymmetrical Chinese fishing nets dipped in the brackish green back waters\
  \ like the long legs of a giant spider caught in motion. A canvass of dotted coconut\
  \ palms outlined the shores.\nNaveen manouvered the twenty feet long Arabian Nights\
  \ into the canal that ran between houses on both sides. Whitewashed housee with\
  \ red tiles turned mossy and with old crepeers entwined around its pillars and Windows\
  \ and every other spot worth climbing up.Nadeem was barely eighteen according to\
  \ the frayed id card that hung limply around his long neck.yet his strong wiry arms\
  \ gripped the steering wheel of the boat with an experienced touch.with his blue\
  \ washed out denim and his Che Guevara t shirt he should be sitting in a class room\
  \ not behind the wheel of a boat house.\nA young girl bathing in the water. Her\
  \ head bobbed above  the ripples, her hair spread out like an umbrella around her\
  \ barely visible shoulder.she glanced to look at us as the boat approached ,the\
  \ loud engine noise cutting through the silence of the scenery, the beginning of\
  \ an ample cleavage visible below the surface.\nAn older woman thrashed  house hold\
  \ clothes on a large stone, soap bubbles frothing around her legs. The thwack of\
  \ her beatings stopped in mid air .she turned and casually dipped her hands in a\
  \ blue bucket by her side, wiped the water off it by rubbing them on her night gown\
  \ and waved at Nadeem.\n\"Ammini Amma sells the best prawns on these waters. You\
  \ buy?\" He asked turning around.i nodded my approval barely takinh my eyes of the\
  \ girl in the water, who caught my letcehrous eyes and had skipped on to the stone\
  \ steps leading to her house.the crack of her ample butt visible through her wet\
  \ skirt.the \n\" you eat  here? She make curry .Good toddy also.\" Nadeem had a\
  \ mischevious glint in his eyes.\nThree men sat haunched in the thick grass under\
  \ a palm tree. They had stopped conversing. Their eyes had a hazy far away look,\
  \ a half finished bottle of rum stood half tilted . One of them made a move to get\
  \ up tying his white mundu around his waist.\n\" no.lets move on\". I said firmly.\
  \ Nadeem  waved out to Ammini Amma as he steers the wheel full right into the silence\
  \ of the waters , the engine noise marching ahead."
