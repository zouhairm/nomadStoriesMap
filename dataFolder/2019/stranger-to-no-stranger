Text: "It started with an apartment in one of the posh areas of Mumbai when I sat\
  \ alone with my pen and paper and I saw him. My visit was for the workshop to the\
  \ city that never sleeps. As soon as I knocked, she opened the door with a welcoming\
  \ smile and said Hi, how was your journey. This is your room and here is the towel,\
  \ soap, and washroom. If you need anything, just let me know. My name is ... and\
  \ I am his girlfriend. If you observe the natural cycle of the body, you will find\
  \ that there is something called do I feel pretty? One minute I was enjoying the\
  \ full extent of her attention, and the next minute it is gone. This city that has\
  \ its own rhythm \"Amchi Mumbai\", which is a mix of everything. All that glitters\
  \ is not gold here. It was Friday evening, my watch displayed 7 pm, when I got down\
  \ from an auto rickshaw near Chocolate Room. I was over the phone when I saw him\
  \ again, tall handsome. Ah! I was lost in those deep dark dreamy eyes. It may sound\
  \ strange that the presence of a stranger could make me feel so beautiful and sexy.\
  \ Thought of calling a few of my friends just to dodge him. That was the time when\
  \ I stared at him carefully, he was dressed in blue jeans and a black t-shirt, clean\
  \ shoes and looked simple. \n\nI managed to finish my call and turned at him for\
  \ the usual conversation and came to know that he is from Pune and working as an\
  \ officer in the Navy. We got into the taxi, sat together and started chatting.\
  \ We went inside in Leopold at Colaba and asked for a place which is comparatively\
  \ quiet. As soon as we realized that we don't know each other's name and we were\
  \ talking for so long. \"Adil\", he said and we have decided to exchange our phone\
  \ numbers,  once we are done ordering but he got a call and my poker face turned\
  \ pensive. I ordered cranberry ice tea along with pasta. I finished my food and\
  \ saw the time it was 1.30 am. I told him that I have to leave now and would love\
  \ to meet him tomorrow as soon as I am finished with my work. My eyes looked at\
  \ him and I consciously knew that I am getting late, but still something was stopping\
  \ me. It was another 5 mins that I looked at him and waved my hand. He quickly uttered\
  \ and told me to give him a call. I typed his number and tried to save my phone\
  \ died. Before I could realize the number was lost. \n\nHe might have been thinking\
  \ many things and waiting for my call. The sense of belongingness that we developed\
  \ in that short span was romantic and real. It may happen that we won't meet again\
  \ in this liberal-minded city or we may meet tomorrow. I am pretty sure that if\
  \ I am going to meet him tomorrow, I will fall in love with him. Was it all just\
  \ a dream or a fairytale? It was a story of two strong-headed people who were not\
  \ meant to be together. Expectations of a woman who fell in love with a man of honor\
  \ and he fell for a woman who cherished every moment with him. Next morning, I wore\
  \ my ruby woo lipstick and that new dress from Zara, smell like a secret, kick those\
  \ silver gladiators, got out with my man and toast to a new life and a new beginning.\
  \ \n\nI believe in love, I believe in love at first sight, I believe in the new\
  \ start, I believe marriages are made in heaven."
