Text: "This will be reiterated by any local you meet, who watches the crowd go crazy\
  \ from afar with a slight frown on his face. This usually-peaceful hamlet in the\
  \ desert state of India is a popular destination for foreigners to play and experience\
  \ the colourful festival of Holi \u2018like a local\u2019. Little do they know that\
  \ this is a hippie parody of Holi, with the locals giving the visitors exactly what\
  \ they want; colours, trance music and a long-lasting high.\n\nHoli in Pushkar is\
  \ a loud, colourful day-long party. Everyone is welcome, and the locals take it\
  \ upon themselves to make you feel at home. If you reach on Holi morning, as we\
  \ did, either prep yourself in the bus, or be ready to be greeted with a fistful\
  \ of colours. None of those nasty, everscrubbing-neverfading pigments like grease,\
  \ enamel paints or eggs. Follow the pumping music through the narrow winding lanes,\
  \ and you shall arrive at Brahma Chowk, with speakers stacked up to 2 storeys high,\
  \ and not an inch to move. The energy is intoxicating. \n\nTummy and bed\nThe city\
  \ is littered with cafes, for the much-needed respite from the sun and the music.The\
  \ roof-top cafes offer a beautiful view of this organic city. However, if you want\
  \ to eat your money\u2019s worth, the roadside stalls offer a palate ranging from\
  \ vegetarian burgers to cinnamon cakes. Shops with Indian sweets and savouries circumscribe\
  \ the ghats but are reserved only for foreigners. Indians are not welcome. So you\
  \ can decide if you want them to earn off you or not.\n\nCommonly a day trip, one\
  \ should book your room well in advance for extended stays. The prices skyrockets\
  \ during Holi and the rooms are very hard to get. For the day-visitors, a place\
  \ to keep your bag and bathe is essential. For that, I advise you to befriend someone,\
  \ let them keep your bags in their room and bathe. Bhargav Ashram is a saviour at\
  \ such times, having clean common toilets let out at Rs. 100 per person. \n\nAnd\
  \ the stuff?\nFrom hashish to ecstasy and bhang cakes, it\u2019s all here. The atmosphere\
  \ transports you to the 60s and 70s reggae culture. Since the goods can very easily\
  \ be spiked, please accept only if the source is reliable. And if you\u2019re worried\
  \ about any authoritative control, you\u2019ll soon spot policemen having parties\
  \ of their own.\n\nWhat is Pushkar?\nPushkar is an ancient city built around the\
  \ sacred Pushkar lake. The ghats along its periphery is a beautiful example of regional\
  \ water-front development. 52 in total, they are primarily used to conduct sacred\
  \ rituals and baths, which is more common during the Pushkar fair than Holi. Hardly\
  \ crowded during the day, this is a good spot to relax after a tiresome day and\
  \ meditate. An occasional saadhu (priest) may you a visit and engage you in a religious\
  \ ritual, asking for bheeksha (alms) in return. \n\nThe city transforms itself every\
  \ year to welcome its visitors from all around the world. The locals seemed to have\
  \ had extensive meetings to stage this unique experience for the visitor, making\
  \ then feel as though it was custom designed for them. The conservative locals,\
  \ of which there are many, do not partake in the celebration. Though they run businesses\
  \ such as restaurants and lodges, they do not allow any of their family members\
  \ to venture out. \u201CThe youth of the city have ruined our Holi celebrations.\
  \ Only a few foreigners used to come before and it was much better\u201D, said a\
  \ staff member at Bhargav Ashram, referring to the fame that Pushkar holi received\
  \ over the last 2-3 years which began attracting young crowd from the neighbouring\
  \ cities as well. He celebrates Holi with his family at a village 10 kms away from\
  \ Pushkar. \u201CI do not let my children outside to play with these rowdys.\u201D\
  \ At the same time, we saw a traditionally-clad old woman starring in horror at\
  \ a few scantily clad foreign girls dancing. This foreign invasion seems to have\
  \ rattled with their traditional sense of culture. However strong their disapproval\
  \ is, this event must cause an annual financial boom to their local economy, which\
  \ they would never want to interrupt."
