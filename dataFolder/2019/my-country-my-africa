Text: "My Africa, where did we go wrong? Mozambique is on of the best tourist destination\
  \ for South Africans. We go there to enjoy the beauty of their beaches and for the\
  \ fact that it's affordable. Travelling through Mozambique has been real eye opening\
  \ for me as I didn't expect the living conditions to be the way they are right now.\
  \ I mean it's 2019 and the conditions that side are so bad, even in Urban areas\
  \ one can't drink from the water tap as the water that side is not sanitary. I enjoyed\
  \ my stay that side, but I feel at the same time I believe more could be done to\
  \ improve the living conditions that side. It is no wonder why most mozambicians\
  \ flee their homes to try and find a better life in South African. The place is\
  \ not very sanitary to a point that when going that side you are in risk of contracting\
  \ malaria and other sicknesses that side. Besides the devastating conditions, the\
  \ country is beautiful and worth visiting. It's a great escape for us South Africans\
  \ especially in winter on our side as it it warm that side. I'm more worried about\
  \ the lack of sanitary equipment, the housing infrastructure considering the fact\
  \ that the country is a cyclone prone area. \n\nHow do people survive, how is it\
  \ that in this day and age that people are still washing clothes from river banks\
  \ and also drink the water from there. The roads are bad and the living conditions\
  \ are so poor. I am appalled by the condition and how friendly the people are. The\
  \ people that side still have humility and love being around tourists, even when\
  \ you are just from a neighbouring country like South Africa. The cities are dangerous\
  \ as crime rate is high and the inflation is so high that even South African rand\
  \ is more valuable than the currency that side. There is not much law around alcohol\
  \ since anyone can sell booze on the street with no license. Which is a nice thing\
  \ when you're  from a country with so many strict laws about alcohol but the downside\
  \ of it is that alcohol can be dangerous and I believe one should have license in\
  \ order to sell or operate a booze selling place. \n\nMy worry is If we South Africans\
  \ take precautionary measures when we visit Mozambique, how about the people living\
  \ there, with the state of the economy how are they able to live and not be affected\
  \ by these sicknesses. Being that side has humbled me in so many ways and made me\
  \ even wonder and imagine how are the people from the rest of Africa living when\
  \ the ones close to me suffer so much. My dream is to travel the world as it opens\
  \ up different perspective about people, cultures and ways of living. The experience\
  \ was humbling, very emotional and quite exceptional as I will hold it in my heart\
  \ as I travel throughout the world and experience the different food of the world."
