Text: "A tiny little blurb in the local paper changed my life forever, thanks to my\
  \ mother.  An ad to teach English in South Korea.  I had of course heard of that\
  \ 'place near Japan', as my grandfather had gone to war there. My 22 year old self\
  \ could honestly not have fathomed what that leap of faith that journey had in store\
  \ for me.  \nNestled in neatly on a map, around 100 km above Pusan, is where my\
  \ life changed forever. \nAs I descended into Ulsan, the fear and the doubt had\
  \ already begun seeping in. The squeaks of terror were harder to silence, so were\
  \ the tiny fear farts. The squeaks turned into a churning in my stomach and I was\
  \ silent in fear.  Welcome to your new home.  More nausea. \nHaving no idea what\
  \ jet lag was, nor knowing a single word of the language, I was dumped in a staff\
  \ room and assigned a roster of classes. I was starting to feel the ooze of doubt\
  \ infiltrating my very soul as I was, I'm certain, shoved into a classroom and told\
  \ to 'just talk.'  That I did, actually assuming that they were all keen as beans\
  \ to learn, learn,learn. Wrong! (wrong,wrong...wrong).  Turns out they were just\
  \ as confused as me, so together we learned how to make it fun, as a team. Turns\
  \ out there was a lot more to this experience than just 'teaching' them English.\
  \  \nLuckily there were evenings, weekends and a few days here and there to knick\
  \ off an see some really amazing stuff.  From temples to beaches to a bustling metropolis\
  \ of people in volumes I had never even dreamed of.  The night time screamed with\
  \ neon signs, music, street food and markets.  It was an assault of the senses,\
  \ particularly to the newbies.\nWith the help of our new found Korean colleagues,\
  \ friends and most importantly our favourite bartender, I dove into everything.\
  \  From temples to beaches and sprawling markets, you had enough to keep you going\
  \ 24/7.  Fuelled by an astronomical amount of Soju, Korean rice wine, there was\
  \ no stone left un-turned when we set out.  There were trinkets and gadgets lining\
  \ the streets! Oh and the food.  The spicy delights I once feared, have now become\
  \ the unique delights I long for to this day.  \nFrom temples to plane to trains\
  \ to World Cup soccer games, we navigated and owned those cities in the end.  It\
  \ was fabulous.  If I could give any young, ambitious traveller a glimpse into my\
  \ mind, it would be that incredible journey.  However, it didn't end there. Didn't\
  \ this new to the world traveller find herself an Aussie boyfriend and it was off\
  \ the the breathtaking, I can't stress that word enough, Sunshine Coast.  Set in\
  \ motion by the unfortunate passing of said boyfriends father, I migrated to Australia.\
  \ Thus beginning another chapter of my life.\nI now reside in Sydney with a family\
  \ of my own.  Life is funny like that, and sometimes you just have to go where the\
  \ wind takes you.  The story begins to write itself over, and over, and over, again\
  \ until it's time to wind it up.  Settled in and happy now, studying and still travelling\
  \ where I can fit it in.  Where the flights take me next, I am still manifesting\
  \ those dreams. Europe will be the next on the list, and with a Danish partner I'd\
  \ say that's in the cards one day. Find your flow and ride the wave. It's an amazing\
  \ journey.  \nIt's a fabulous way to plunge into a new world and it is never dull.\
  \ That I promise you. There is always adventure if you know where to look, and the\
  \ longer you are there, the easy it is to find.  Word of mouth and new friends,\
  \ with experience under belt, are a great kick off point.  Make sure though that\
  \ you do use a travel guide so you don't accidentally miss a thing.  You may never\
  \ get back, so make it count."
