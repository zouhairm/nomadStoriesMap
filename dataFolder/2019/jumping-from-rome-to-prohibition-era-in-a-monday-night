Text: "There I was, on a chilly March Monday night in the city of Chester, UK, extending\
  \ a London trip to meet Victor, an old friend from college. My expectations towards\
  \ the night were very down-to-earth: some lame sightseeing and a beer in a poorly\
  \ themed medieval tavern. But, as John Lennon once sang, \u2018life is what happens\
  \ to you while you\u2019re busy making other plans\u2019.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re going\
  \ to love the boys\u2019, said Victor, as we walked to meet his neighbor Rob and\
  \ their friend, Robie, the designated driver for the night - be safe, everyone.\
  \ \n\nThe rest of our party were waiting in the Coach House Inn, a cozy place with\
  \ halfway painted pastel blue walls and dark leather armchairs. By the fireplace,\
  \ we found Jason and Dave with pints. And the group was whole. David, legs crossed,\
  \ sitting straight up with caramel oxfords, was a calm thin man and an exact opposite\
  \ of Jason, a heavy strong Italian looking fella. An incredible resemblance to Laurel\
  \ & Hardy was hard to miss. Rob, the tallest, was more cheerful, always with an\
  \ interesting chat. Robie was a quiet but wise listener, ready to put a good thought\
  \ on the table. \n\nJason jumped up to say hello, with two kisses, one for each\
  \ cheek, a thoughtful gesture. This is how we greet in my homeland Brazil. \u2018\
  So, are we staying here?\u2019, I asked. Dave replied: \u2018No, we\u2019re going\
  \ to pub crawl and we\u2019re going to sing\u2019.\n\nAnd, oh, they did! To my surprise,\
  \ the four men in front of me were actually the Contraband, an a cappella barbershop\
  \ singing quartet. We went out to the next pub with a detour over the ruins of an\
  \ old Roman Coliseum. They sang Coney Island Baby to warm up. I couldn\u2019t tell\
  \ if I was more impressed by the harmonic voices or the outstanding sight: two thousand\
  \ years ago, this was the stage for the Roman entertainment. How could I, or anyone\
  \ really, have missed Chester?\n\nAs we walked through the beautiful streets, Contraband\
  \ shared all the historic facts of this amazing city. Chester is located in the\
  \ ruins of what was once known as Deva Victrix, a fort built by the romans in the\
  \ AD 70s. The town is considered to be an historic site with its typical columns,\
  \ double level streets and landmarks such as the Eastgate Clock, installed in the\
  \ remains of the fort east wall in the late 17th century.\n\nAnd there was a lot\
  \ more than meets the eye. As we went on a suspicious alley, Victor pointed to a\
  \ discreet black door. \u2018It\u2019s here!\u2019, he said. Jason knocked three\
  \ times. A man opened the door, and welcomed us to the Prohibition. Inside we found\
  \ this unbelievable salon, decorated in the manners of the Prohibition Era in the\
  \ US. It is a speakeasy in the middle of Chester!\n\nThe show started. Contraband\
  \ performed Elton John\u2019s Can You Feel The Love Tonight. And the place\u2019\
  s atmosphere just changed: Couples holding hands with loving eyes and gasps. This\
  \ girl, a tourist from Canada sitting in front of her boyfriend, had tears of joy\
  \ running through her cheeks! Not a scene I shall easily forget.\n\nAfter applauses\
  \ and beers, our journey proceeded into the next venue. Bear in mind that each place\
  \ we visit has a distinctive feeling and history. Pub crawling in Chester is something\
  \ unexpected and amazing. This time, it was a place inside an old crypt building\
  \ that the boys filled with the Beatles\u2019 tune Lady Madonna.\n\nOur last stop\
  \ was Shropshire Arms, for Open Mic Night. I got invited by Victor to do a Brazilian\
  \ folk song duet and it felt like a powerful bonding moment, my personal surprise\
  \ from the city who gave me so much joy in that evening.\n\nMonday nights from now\
  \ on will have a hard time keeping up with my marvelous experience in Chester, a\
  \ city that gathers around the old, new, unusual and vibrant people, places, music\
  \ and moments I never expected to find."
