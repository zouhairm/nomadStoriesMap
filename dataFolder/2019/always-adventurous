Text: "I love traveling in an adventurous way, but what happened in my 14-daystrip\
  \ to Morocco was totally unexpected. I went to Fez, to Mecnes, Rabat, and when I\
  \ was heading to Essauira by second class train (crazy thing in Morocco where you\
  \ have to fight for a seat) and bus...After an hour in the bus I realised the ticket\
  \ officer had sold me the wrong ticket and I was heading to Agadir instead of Essauira.\
  \ \n\nWhat could I do? I started to talk to a girl who spoke english and inmediately\
  \ she and her whole family started to help me! They called I don't know how many\
  \ people to get me a bus to go from Agadir to Essauira. When I arrived to Agadir,\
  \ the old woman bought me a bus ticket and she did'nt even want me to pay for it.\
  \ Such an angel, as I called her. \n\nI wait some hours in a dark room, until tue\
  \ bus came. When it came, it was a 1950s bus! So old, and ruined. It drove me along\
  \ the coast in such a dangerous way, until I arrived to Essauira. Where a reggae\
  \ kind of Bob Marley man waited for me at the hostel. \n\nI was finally where I\
  \ was supposed to arrive 10 hours before. And I slept so well. \n\nEven though in\
  \ that moment it was a stressful situation, now I remember it as a funny story.\
  \ The most adventurous things are the ones we remember as the best."
