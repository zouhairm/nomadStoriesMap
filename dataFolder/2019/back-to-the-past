Text: "There I was, 25 years later. Standing at the stairs in front of the water fountain\
  \ to the main entrance of 1 St. Francis Place, standing tall and proud on the corner\
  \ of One and Folsom Street as cars sped down the main road behind me.  The flower\
  \ shop where I used to hang out because of the smell and the card shop where I once\
  \ stole some pogs and got in trouble for, forever keeping me off the criminal path,\
  \ were no longer to be found. Besides that, nothing much had changed and yet so\
  \ much had. My best friend, Tal, meeting again for the first time after 23 years,\
  \ was right beside me, just like the old times. There was something euphoric about\
  \ being back to the place we lived when we were 8 years old.\n\nAs we walked up\
  \ the stairs there was a sense of excitement and wonder. The main entrance had the\
  \ exact same set up. To enter you had to inform the desk of who you were seeing,\
  \ but being the adventurous ladies we are, and thinking they might not let us in,\
  \ we sneaked passed as someone was exiting.\n\nThere was a strange sense of being\
  \ home, after 23 years, I was finally back. But home had shrunk. We walked towards\
  \ the main grassy square where Easter egg hunts and Halloween get togethers were\
  \ organised and where I started my first business selling one-dollar sea shells\
  \ for one dollar. I look around and all I can think is how much smaller it is. The\
  \ distance from here to building 3, my building, our building, was much further\
  \ than 100 meters. I rode bikes, rollerbladed, played hide and seek, created secret\
  \ club rooms in every inch of this place, which now seems much more compact.\n\n\
  We continued to building 3. Crossing the pool, where I swam laps, now looks more\
  \ like I could float from side to side. Arriving at the building, we inspected the\
  \ downstairs area. On the left, there was the party room, where we used to have\
  \ Sunday brunches, birthday parties. We would often sneak in using a credit card\
  \ or get the code off of one of the employees who succumbed to our charming 8 year-old-selves\
  \ and was now a, dare I say,  fitness room. Clientele had clearly changed. To get\
  \ into building 3 you also needed an access code, which we obviously did not have.\
  \ We tried the old-school credit card technique with little success. So we waited,\
  \ and waited, and waited, until finally someone came out and we smoothly and confidently\
  \ slipped inside like we belonged there. Feeling a little high from the win, we\
  \ pushed the elevator button enthusiastically, 2.  My floor. My apartment. My home.\
  \ Remembering all the fun and random moments we had in the hallways. It was tempting\
  \ to ring the doorbell to door number 7, instead, we thought it best to keep a low\
  \ profile, deciding to check out the garbage shoot I once jumped down with my sisters\
  \ instead. It was still there, just as dirty and just as high. We then went to the\
  \ third floor, Tal\u2019s apartment, where I hid under the table and couldn\u2019\
  t be found sending all the adults into a meltdown. \n\nAs we exited the complex\
  \ looking at buildings 4, 5, and 6 we exchanged notes on who and where each of our\
  \ old friends lived, Molly and Claire were in building number 5. Brian in building\
  \ 4, and Scott in building 1, way back at the front near the reception. Returning\
  \ to the fountain, we took out a coin, turned our backs to it, giggled like 8-year-old\
  \ girls, and made a wish.\n\nAnd that was it, the tour of our old stomping grounds\
  \ where we were carefree, and the world was ours, a world that looked much bigger\
  \ than this one, had concluded. However, the adventure didn\u2019t stop there. On\
  \ we went to explore the greater outskirts of 1 St. Francis Place to realise just\
  \ how small we were and how big San Francisco really is, matching memories to reality."
