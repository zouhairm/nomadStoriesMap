Text: "In our local language Shona we have a saying that says \"chitsva chiri murutsoka\"\
  \ literally translated \"new this are found in the feet\", the saying is interpreted\
  \ to mean one can only experience new things as they travel or embark on a journey.\
  \ It is meant to encourage exploration and adventure in our people. \nHistory is\
  \ full of those adventures that our people have taken over the years. Iyt is only\
  \ through adventure that we get to discover things and experience new experiences\
  \ in life. It is for this reason that Zimbabwe as a country encourge domestic tourism.\
  \ Citizens are encouraged to travel along the length and breath of the country and\
  \ to discover the richness in terms of tourism products and cultural heritage that\
  \ the country has to over. From the popular Victoria Fall, Mana Pools to the not\
  \ so popular Mtarazi Falls in the eastern province of Manicaland. \nManicaland is\
  \ full of yet to be discovered and explored tourist destinations. The unfortunate\
  \ thing is most people are only sold Victoria Falls and areas such as the mysterious\
  \  Mt Inyangani,  Bridalveil Falls, Chimanimani National Park, Inyangombe Falls,\
  \ Gairezi river, Vumba Botanical Gardens, among many other attraction. Indeed Manicaland\
  \ is a world of wonders on its own. Say one traverses this mountainous province\
  \ your breath is taken away by the scenery , vegetation and even Prince of Wales\
  \ have a place named after him the \"Prince of Wales View\" in Mutare.  A breathtaking\
  \ view that took the attention of the Prince of Wales when he visited the country.\
  \ All you will say is \"I didn't expect to find such beautiful, serene environment\
  \ in Manicaaland"
