Text: "Finding myself in the thick of an empowering demonstrative protest was the\
  \ least expected when I set out on a relaxing New Year\u2019s getaway to Kerala.\
  \ Kerala is a coastal state in India, proudly known as \u2018God\u2019s own Country\u2019\
  \ and rightfully so. However, there\u2019s a painfully long socio-cultural war that\
  \ has loomed over this breathtaking state for quite a while now, which I unknowingly\
  \ stumbled upon. \n\nJust a few hours back, my friends and I were leisurely sipping\
  \ on steaming south Indian coffee, while seated at an Italian cafe perched on the\
  \ popular Varkala cliff, hypnotized by the view. Past the rugged cliffs were two\
  \ coconut trees in a romantic embrace and a few scattered fishermen boats afar in\
  \ the Arabian Sea while occasional birds flew in and out of the picturesque frame.\
  \ The cloudless sky and the sea looked like twins, separated by the horizon. It\
  \ was the perfect New Year\u2019s gift from nature.\n\nI could have sat there all\
  \ day, but the temptation of watching the sunset from our next destination in Kerala;\
  \ a gorgeous houseboat drifting on the lush mangrove-covered backwaters of Alleppey,\
  \ got us moving. It was late afternoon when our cab arrived and thus we set out\
  \ on the unexpected drive. \n\nAlleppey, situated in central Kerala was a three-hour\
  \ drive from Varkala, located down south. As we weaved through quaint towns and\
  \ fishermen villages with miles of coastal backdrop, large groups of women frequently\
  \ appeared on the left side of the road. My optimistic mind thought it\u2019s refreshing\
  \ to see abundant women population in rural parts of India, however, as we approached\
  \ the national highway the traffic got tighter and now there were a ridiculous amount\
  \ of women. Women from varied walks of life holding hands; in colourful saris, burkhas,\
  \ schoolgirls in uniforms and even nuns! They formed a vibrant human chain that\
  \ accompanied us throughout the drive.  \n\nWe soon learnt from our driver Venkat\
  \ that millions of women were going to form a wall crisscrossing through all fourteen\
  \ districts of Kerala, covering six hundred kilometres. This was a demonstration\
  \ of renewed strength and equality; a protest against the religious conservatives\
  \ who have been opposing the Supreme Court verdict that lifted the ban on women\
  \ entering the famous Sabarimala temple in Kerala; the shrine of the eternally celibate\
  \ Hindu deity, Lord Ayyappa. It was offensive to learn that women under the menstruating\
  \ age bracket weren\u2019t allowed to enter the temple because they were considered\
  \ impure. \n\nI couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine how these women felt on being\
  \ denied their fundamental right to visit a temple in their own city, while I and\
  \ most women were freely visiting other cities and countries. Yet, they stood like\
  \ warriors under the burning sun with a determination that burnt even brighter inside\
  \ them. \n\nWe were trapped in traffic when we saw a large group of men on the right\
  \ side of the road, wearing black shirts and black lungis (a traditional garment\
  \ worn like a sarong in southern India). They were a communist party, protesting\
  \ against the lifting of the ban. As most of them passed by, Venkat honked at a\
  \ couple of them that lagged behind amidst the road animatedly conversing while\
  \ blocking the way for the ongoing traffic. This enraged them and they charged at\
  \ us and starting furiously banging their hands on the car. Venkat instinctively\
  \ locked the doors and attempted unsuccessfully to manoeuvre out of there. We were\
  \ terrified as we saw a few more of the members approaching the car.\n\nAt this\
  \ point, two schoolgirls who were part of the wall saw this and ran a few hundred\
  \ meters ahead, informing the policemen at the nearby junction. Thankfully, minutes\
  \ later the policemen dispersed the men and got the traffic moving again. As we\
  \ waved goodbye to the girls, I was overwhelmed and filled with renewed respect\
  \ for the brave women of Kerala who were individually united, fighting for a cause\
  \ bigger than themselves.\n\nWe obviously did not reach the houseboat in time to\
  \ watch the sunset. But that's alright because you don\u2019t always get what you\
  \ expect, sometimes you get much more. In this case, an empowering journey with\
  \ the wonder wall of women."
