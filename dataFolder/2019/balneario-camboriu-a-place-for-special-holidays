Text: "Maybe when you read something about Brazil, you will imagine a tropical island,\
  \ exuberant places and beautiful beaches that you want to take a picture. Nevertheless,\
  \ it is more things that you need to know about this place located on the Brazilian\
  \ southern state of Santa Catarina, such as is famous for the cable car, unique\
  \ in the world, that links the city's central beach and the beach of Laranjeiras\
  \ known as Parque Unipraias and also has more attractions as Cristo Luz, Parque\
  \ Cyro Gevaerd, Capela de Santo Amaro and Parque Ecol\xF3gico Rio Cambori\xFA. \n\
  The Unipraias Park can be seem as a simple and regular form of transportation but\
  \ it is much more than that because takes people to a tour inside an area that are\
  \ almost extinct as Atlantica Woods and give tourist the chance to watch breathtaking\
  \ ocean views. Cristo Luz is a kind of monument that you must visit because it is\
  \ up to 33 meters high at top of Morro da Cruz where you will be able to enjoy other\
  \ activities, for instance: Stores, live shows and some restaurants.\nThe Parque\
  \ Cyro Gevaerd most known as Santur is a natural place where you can enjoy the brazilian\
  \ fauna and flora. It shows a different types of animals such as world of birds,\
  \ a aquarium and some kind of museums as the Archeologic, Oceanographic, Fishermen\
  \ museums. If you want more, you can visit a minifarm that show some local species\
  \ and the zoo. To complete this natural visit to the fauna and flora, I suggested\
  \ you a walk for the Parque Ecol\xF3gico Rio Cambori\xFA where the main attractions\
  \ include a sort of local plants that combines beautiful gardens.\nThis attractive\
  \ zone has the Capela de Santo Amaro (St. Amaro Chappel) that had been built in\
  \ 1810 and was named Historical Patrimony in 1998. This building was built with\
  \ a mixture of whale oil and mortar. Here you have a sum up of the most popular\
  \ activities but that's not all.\nThe beaches of Santa Catarina are a synonymous\
  \ of good life, thanks in large part to its banks toasted by the sun. Guarda do\
  \ Emba\xFA is one of the best surf spots in Brazil and Praia do Rosa is the state's\
  \ most sophisticated game center. In any of these places, travelers will be amazed\
  \ as soon as he puts his feet on the pristine sands. Although, I really felt a completely\
  \ relax on my body when I had been in Bombinhas because this beach city has 26 beaches\
  \ that are characterized by a white sand and crystal clear sea. The most important\
  \ beaches of all them are Bombas, Bombinhas, Porto Da V\xF3, Sepultura and Mariscal.\
  \ This section is where you will be able to discover a new sport and do it meanwhile\
  \ you see some fish under the water because this is perfect for Diving and it is\
  \ the main sport for excelence in Bombinhas. Visitors have a variety of school's\
  \ options to take some Diving lessons.\nTo end up, you have some discos and pubs\
  \ to night out in a city where the majority of tourists are students who go to have\
  \ a good time after the school graduation. All these combination of nature, museums,\
  \ buildings, sports in the beach and nightlife stlye make Balne\xE1rio Cambori\xFA\
  \ a perfect place for visitors on special holidays."
