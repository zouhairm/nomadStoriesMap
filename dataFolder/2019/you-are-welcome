Text: "Growing up (in the 90\u2019s) in Botswana and being half Zimbabwean, Half South\
  \ African \u2013 but identifying as and to a large extent \u201Clooking\u201D Tswana-\
  \ I often found that people (strangers) were often quick to share xenophobic anecdotes\
  \ with me, under the misguided impression that I was Tswana and shared the same\
  \ views. It was not out of the ordinary to hear tales of cannibals from Congo, the\
  \ poverty and war torn streets of Burundi, the drug lords from Nigeria and pirates\
  \ on the coasts of Somalia. \n\nThe experience of growing up hearing xenophobic\
  \ tirades and watching, frankly, scary or shameful depictions of Africa on TV resulted\
  \ in my having a negative view on what life on the rest of the continent was like.\
  \ \n\nFast-forward 2 decades later, I took my first trip to Lagos, Nigeria. On arrival\
  \ at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, I had my defenses up. I remembered\
  \ all the advice I had been given prior to the trip by well meaning associates:\
  \ \u201CKeep a stern look on your face\u201D, \u201Cbe abrupt\u201D, \u201Cdon\u2019\
  t smile\u201D, \u201Cand don\u2019t appear weak\u201D. \n\nAbout 20 minutes from\
  \ disembarking, my defenses wavered in the humidity. Lagos\u2019 heat and humidity\
  \ immediately embraces you as soon as you get off the plane. It is a warm embrace-\
  \ if you love heat. If you do not enjoy heat, I can image it would feel intrusive.\
  \ \n\nHaving to contend with a slow immigration process and walking past the airports\
  \ moldy walls, I found myself prejudging the place. My defenses once again regained\
  \ their composure and the heat became unbearable. After what felt like a lifetime\
  \ in a sauna, with too many people, the immigration officer ushered me forward and\
  \ the first thing he said to me was \u201Cyou are welcome, Madam\u201D, with a smile.\
  \ His greeting took me by surprise- I am welcome for what, I wondered. \u201CThanks,\
  \ good morning\u201D, I responded. \u201CGood morning madam\u201D, he cheerfully\
  \ responded. We exchanged pleasantries and at the end of our exchange, his good\
  \ -bye was simply \u201Cyou are welcome madam\u201D. \n\nWalking out of the airport\
  \ that is all you hear \u201Cyou are welcome\u201D- as a way of greeting or saying\
  \ good-bye. It really hit me.\nI had heard so many things about Lagos, I had heard\
  \ about crime and chaos, I had heard about poverty and corruption. What I had never\
  \ heard is that when you arrive \u2013 the first words said to are: \u201Cyou are\
  \ welcome\u201D. And indeed you will feel welcome. \n\nwhen I arrived in Lagos,\
  \ I expected to find chaos and noise; I expected to find a city of contradiction\
  \ where poverty and obscene wealth reside side by side. and I found those things.\
  \  \n\nWhat I did not expect to find is that Lagos is warm and friendly. Lagos is\
  \ like that aunt who hugs you tightly when you visit her, before proceeding to feed\
  \ you with far too much food despite all your protests that you are full. She is\
  \ that cousin you always thought was undistinguished and lacking in character, only\
  \ to spend time with them and to realise, much to your shame, has more wealth, breadth\
  \ and depth of character and personality than you will ever possess. She is that\
  \ genuine friend that unapologetically holds the mirror up and shows you how your\
  \ cowardice has sold you out. Above all else \u2013 She is reassuring, kind and\
  \ overly generous, and:  You, as You are, are welcome."
