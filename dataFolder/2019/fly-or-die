Text: "Leaving my comforting yet somehow stifling job on a private yacht for the unknown\
  \ world of being a full time touring singer songwriter was my goal.\n\nI left the\
  \ USA and that \u2018perfect job\u2019 to freefall into a life of my dreams playing\
  \ my own songs to audiences around the world.\n\nNot long after I returned home\
  \ to Oz was I confronted with the continual \u2018itchy feet syndrome\u2019 never\
  \ content to stay in one spot for long.\n\nAfter a year I booked my next big trip\
  \ & first BIG tour of Europe, taking in Greece, Czech Republic, England, Estonia,\
  \ Germany, Denmark.. all for a taste of that adventure & unkown. \n\nI played gigs\
  \ in tiny bars, underground, in theatres, restaurants, irish pubs cafes.. it all\
  \ led to feeling like there is more to life than living a 9-5 at home, buying a\
  \ house in suburbia and raising 2.5 kids, a dog and a husband. \n\nMaybe there was\
  \ more to life than all of this. So I came home, packed up everything, sold most\
  \ of my stuff, got myself a visa and left for the UK, moving over with only a massive\
  \ suitcase, my guitar, enough shoes & clothes to get by and my good luck charms\
  \ to keep my spirits high. \n\nAnd so began the free fall into my next phase of\
  \ life... settling in Germany, Berlin, becoming a full time troubadour touring Europe.\
  \ And learning how to live an unconventional life. As a singer songwriter. Following\
  \ my heart & dreams."
