Text: "Waking up to the same sun, in a new country was, well, quite the same and yet\
  \ different. The shower system was foreign to us and and struggling to figure out\
  \ its opetation got my research partners and myself delayed. The hot water was so\
  \ pleasing to our Indian skins that each one of us would always want to stay there\
  \ for some minutes more. \nThe drive to Laurea was mesmerizing; the lush green aura,\
  \ the clean environment charmed me. What I saw in my life for the first time was\
  \ the traffic decorum of the country. The vehicles would wait for the pedestrians\
  \ to cross the road first and only then would they pass by (something unimaginable\
  \ in India). \nThe Finnish breakfast is the best I've ever had. It comprised a variety\
  \ of different breads, milk, butter, jam, powders, yoghurt, vegetables and other\
  \ alien products that it would get so mind boggling to make one final decision on\
  \ eating one of the many delicacies. So many new varieties of food in front of your\
  \ eyes and so tempting that one will always want to taste a bit of everything. I\
  \ did the same. \n\nThe next astonishing thing, which maybe is a very simple and\
  \ monotonous chore for the Finnish guys everyday after meals, that I noticed, was\
  \ the segregation of the trash bins; the bio/solid waste in one, the plastic waste\
  \ in one and then the paper waste in another. This was new. In India, I threw almost\
  \ everything in the same bin. \n\nAnother interesting thing that happened was the\
  \ visit to the summer house of Dr. Paivi Grano, where there was a sauna and we could\
  \ swim in the Baltic if we had the courage to do the same. Well, we did have the\
  \ courage for this at least and were quite confident, prepared and brave, unlike\
  \ our thesis presentations. We also hogged pizzas and drank good, warm, tomato soups.\n\
  This experience of a typical Finnish sauna's one of the best experiences I've ever\
  \ had. The chillness of the air at late in the evening and then sitting and warming\
  \ ourselves up in that small sauna room and having fun with throwing more water\
  \ on the metal rod (or something I'm not sure about) that would give out excessive\
  \ steam, sometimes seemingly unbearable one, each time one threw water on it. The\
  \ steam would clog mostly on the ceiling space, where the people sit to bask themselves\
  \ up. Even breathing the hot air was becoming difficult. Precilla, I remember, was\
  \ sweating more than anyone else and she seemed to enjoy the warmth in her bikini.\
  \ After taking the last steam, which is deliberately made the hottest of all, we\
  \ all walked towards the sea to try a dip in it. Precilla was too scared to try\
  \ that so she just stood watching the others. Nivedha slipped on the stairs and\
  \ rolled automatically into the sea, without making any efforts. And I took a proper,\
  \ long dip in the sea and rushed to the sauna room to get warmed up, all over again.\
  \ I wish this cycle of running from the sauna to the sea and back to the sauna wouldn't\
  \ end but sadly, the men were also waiting for their fun moments in the sauna.\n\
  The evening was quite refreshing and we enjoyed the ride back with Miss Virpi and\
  \ spotted some deer and wild rabbit.\nNext was the Amusement Park and THIS was the\
  \ craziest day ever. \nThe ride was the Burj Khalifa of Finland, a drop tower. Sitting\
  \ at a height of some hundreds of feet above the ground and getting a crazy free\
  \ fall was just an insane feeling that I cannot describe. My dear friend that I\
  \ looked up to for some consolation was happily laughing her lungs out whereas the\
  \ Finnish kids, some 5 to 10 years younger to me were probably having a conversation\
  \ on what they had for breakfast or whatever because it didn\u2019t seem from their\
  \ faces that they even had 1/3rd of the fright, horror and dismay that I had when\
  \ I was right up there in the air, seeing the whole of the world of the freaking\
  \ Helsinki."
