Text: "We were stalked by a whisper of doubt from the moment we arrived in Irkutsk.\
  \ We saw it first in the smirk of our hostel owner; heard it in a laugh ringing\
  \ down the phone, made by a woman from the emergency services we registered our\
  \ expedition with. Later it appears in the clucking of maternal tourists there to\
  \ witness the vastness of Baikal\u2019s frozen expanse from the safety of the shore.\n\
  \nStood on the ice at the tip of Olkhon Island and surrounded by sceptical faces,\
  \ we were three women, come to cross Siberia\u2019s Lake Baikal in winter, and we\
  \ were not supposed to be here.\n\nFrom January to May every year the pure waters\
  \ of the largest freshwater lake in the world are stilled for months as its depths\
  \ turn so cold the surface freezes. A thick window of glassy blue ice appears, stretching\
  \ from horizon to horizon. To the locals, this is simply the ebb and flow of the\
  \ seasons, nothing more than the time where boats are put to bed, roads are etched\
  \ across the surface and life goes on. \n\nFor the three of us, images of its myriad\
  \ formations were spellbinding, and have called us there from nearly 4000 miles\
  \ away. We plan to complete a crossing of Baikal\u2019s vast plains in 4 days, pulling\
  \ pulks as we walk and sleeping perched in a 4-season tent above a kilometre and\
  \ a half of abyss. \n\nOur driver however is unconvinced, shaking his head as we\
  \ pull our gear from the roof of his sturdy bukhanka (the ubiquitous Siberian van)\
  \ and start to configure our packs and sleds into burdened pulks. The only way to\
  \ reach Khoboy, the end of the island and the best place to start our journey, is\
  \ on a sightseeing tour along the coast from the shamanic town of Khuzhir. We were\
  \ forced to spend the day in limbo, champing at the bit as he drove us to various\
  \ sections of cascading ice along the cliffs.\n\nHe speaks earnestly to Theresa,\
  \ our group\u2019s linguist. She smiles ruefully at us. \"He\u2019s telling us not\
  \ to go.\" We open our hands and shrug our shoulders in a universal gesture of apology\
  \ and continue our packing regardless. He is unaware that we\u2019ve been over this\
  \ plenty of times. That at each stage before this point we had heard one phrase\
  \ repeated. \"Three women? Really? Without a man?\"\n\nOur journey so far had shown\
  \ us we had little choice but to ignore his warning. Before departing, we\u2019\
  d considered the impact of travelling here as women, planned how to keep safe and\
  \ what local customs we should respect. We\u2019d overlooked the part where we would\
  \ be told we couldn\u2019t do it, where the vital information we needed to cross\
  \ would be corrupted based on our sex. \n\nWith my pack firmly secured to my sled\
  \ and harness clipped into place, I turn to my team. \"Ready?\" I ask nervously.\
  \ They nod the affirmative. \n\nBefore we go, we are asked for pictures; as the\
  \ only passengers on a one-way trip we\u2019ve drawn a crowd. Olga, a young woman\
  \ from St Petersburg, plants herself firmly in the centre, which is welcomed by\
  \ us. On the way out she\u2019d helped us contact a local weather station, translating\
  \ their reply to us and confirming we were safe to depart. \n\nShe hugs us, clutching\
  \ the three of us in one hold whilst two worried mothers attempt to sway us back\
  \ onto the van. \"These people\" she says. \"They only know how to spend life on\
  \ their sofa. They do not know what we can do.\" And with that she let us go.\n\n\
  Emboldened by the immovable faith of another woman, the doubts sewn into our journey\
  \ are unwound. With seemingly lighter pulks, we stride out onto the ice and are\
  \ embraced by a welcome unknown."
