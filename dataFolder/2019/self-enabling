Text: "Self-Enabling\nAs a young Afghan girl who has started her working journey in\
  \ 2007 as volunteer, it was my goal to be one-day voice of community in national\
  \ and international platforms and am happy that right now am in that position. For\
  \ me it was unacceptable to accept all of my society's problems and as other girls,\
  \ get married and settled life with husband and kids, but instead I applied for\
  \ university and besides my work, have done my bachelor and masters in Persian language\
  \ and literature. Beside that I was working as female instructor and radio presenter\
  \ to young generation in the field of media and modern journalism. \nAfter that\
  \ I started my activities with focus on tickling my community's problems in fields\
  \ of youth and health, and more than two years was producing programs on both aspects\
  \ with different topics, which I got awards and appreciation letters. Beside production,\
  \ I was also worked as part of middle management team and was doing coordination\
  \ between high management and lower level. Also had activities with different NGOs\
  \ on environment protection campaigns, water saving methods, volunteering work values,\
  \ and helping my professors on Linguistics related researches. \nIn 2014 I joined\
  \ Afghan government as spokesperson of Afghanistan Urban Water Supply and Sewerage\
  \ corporation where my main task was connecting the organization with people, other\
  \ organizations, donors and media. My best efforts made me to have promotions and\
  \ became the first woman who is in high management as head of Human resources department.\
  \ In this section, was mostly focused on how to provide best recruitment facilities\
  \ to my community's young educated generation, and developed policies enabling women\
  \ and youth involvement in water sector of the country. In 2017 I have joined senior\
  \ advisory office of Afghanistan\u2019s president in United Nations affairs, and\
  \ our main agenda was to work on Delivery As One or ONE United Nation under Afghan\
  \ ownership and effective usage of financial aids provided by United Nations in\
  \ the country. One UN agenda outcomes provide more effectiveness in projects and\
  \ budget consuming in 6 thematic areas: health, education, livelihood and food security,\
  \ rule of law, returnees and migrants and human rights. we were working closely\
  \ with more than 21 agency of United Nations in Afghanistan to make them agreed\
  \ on having one leader, one office, one program, one budget and one voice. \nin\
  \ Dec, 2018 I have joined Women economic empowerment national priority program in\
  \ the capacity of deputy program director leading a coordination unit with close\
  \ partnership of 12 implementing agencies in the overall country. Our main goal\
  \ is to economically empower poor Afghan women; the ones that couldn\u2019t benefit\
  \ from different programs implemented in the country up to now. \nThe journey is\
  \ still going on and never it ends, for me all these years and working interventions,\
  \ were like traveling different countries of the world and facing new people, learning\
  \ new lessons, gaining different experiences and of course stepping higher levels\
  \ and getting more enabled as human and as a woman. Having the beautiful assets\
  \ of professional appreciations and awards within my pocket makes me proud of myself;\
  \ and looking at all of these achievements puts more pressure as it gives the sense\
  \ of more responsibility towards my country. A self-enabled woman is quiet enough\
  \ to lead her life and take different responsibilities plus working for other vulnerable\
  \ people. World needs more enabled women, enabled humans of course!"
