Text: "On the first night in our sheltered, dull, and gloomy office refuge at New\
  \ Orleans Tulane hospital, everything seemed normal for the most part. By the grace\
  \ of God, my entire family gathered together along with my mother\u2019s boss, Pamela,\
  \ who had also brought her family to patiently wait for the storm to blow over.\
  \  Little did we know, Hurricane Katrina would in fact, blow over all of New Orleans\
  \ creating a catastrophic disaster for its victims. This daunting feeling hovered\
  \ over us like a dark energy cultivating from the robust winds and rainstorms that\
  \ stirred as the hours passed. I often recall seeing the devastation on everyone\u2019\
  s face as they sat by, calmly listening to news updates from the office radio. It\
  \ seemed as if the severity of the storm grew worse and worse as minutes turned\
  \ into hours, and hours turned into days. Quite frankly, the inevitable was upon\
  \ all of us; however, my nine year old self decided to focus on creating an imaginary\
  \ world. I turned our gloomy office space into a fortress. I used almost all of\
  \ the copy paper to create child-like masterpieces, in which I hung on each wall\
  \ of the elongated sections we inhabited in this particular area of the building.\
  \ I filled the grey walls with sheets of paper covered in my Crayola crayon doodles.\
  \ In the midst of all this chaos, I did what any ordinary kid would do, I tried\
  \ to have fun. I didn\u2019t realize how serious things were becoming until there\
  \ became a routine of having to choose between eating tuna with crackers or cold\
  \ ravioli for the next few days. I remember constantly begging my parents to find\
  \ some other food--to dig inside an invisible bag of goodies and reveal some type\
  \ of treat that would mend this routine madness. By the fourth day, the city I had\
  \ only known for nine years was being taken from me. My home had been flooded without\
  \ warning, ruining every inch of my childhood; consequently, Hurricane Katrina became\
  \ a fighting force in my life, she came without any remorse. The very next day,\
  \ we received notice of an immediate evacuation. The entire hospital had been vandalized,\
  \ perpetrated by looters who raided the pharmacies, and the hallways were filled\
  \ with men who preyed on innocent little girls like myself. It was time for us to\
  \ make a move; to finally leave the depressing office--my ingenious fortress, behind.\
  \ As we abandoned our place of refuge to leap into the possibility of safety, we\
  \ ended up having to sleep outside in the parking garage, waiting in an enormous\
  \ line of hurricane victims, hospital patients, and physicians. After two days,\
  \ we finally reached the top of Tulane hospital, in which a small-scale helicopter\
  \ anticipated our arrival. The propellers swung with full force, blowing my puny\
  \ body to the ground. I was terrified. Within seconds, an Air Force soldier grabbed\
  \ my waist, carefully placing me inside the aircraft along with my mother and Pamela\
  \ while the rest of our families followed suit. I didn\u2019t have any idea of where\
  \ we were being flown to, but I didn\u2019t care. I was full of joy that we survived;\
  \ we made it. To my dismay, I glanced over, and saw Pamela sobbing. I guess the\
  \ miracle of our survival didn\u2019t truly dawn on her until the moment we were\
  \ suspended nearly 20,000 feet into the air. Unlike me, she felt burdened by her\
  \ safety. It seemed as though she was doubtful for New Orleans; she had to accept\
  \ leaving behind other victims and survivors as we transported to a different city.\
  \ \nWe were headed towards Houston, Texas; however, in my mind, it was more of an\
  \ unfamiliar territory. As we landed on the rooftop of yet another building, we\
  \ had to wait to be brought to a homeless shelter called The Star of Hope. From\
  \ there, I never thought I\u2019d find myself having to adapt in yet another place\
  \ I barely knew. We received clothes, toiletries, blankets, and I even had a choice\
  \ in finding books to read. For once, everything seemed to be alright. And for what\
  \ it\u2019s worth, I simply made it my new fortress."
