Text: "I was in Veracruz on an invitation. I had met Joaquin in the university town\
  \ of Cholula, the previous week, through a friend. The night had ended with him\
  \ inviting us to his little sister's fifteenth birthday celebrations in Joaquin\u2019\
  s home town; Mexico may be the kind of place that inspires caution, but it is also\
  \ full of big hearted, fun- loving people. Fifteenth \u2018coming of age\u2019 parties\
  \ are a big deal in Veracruz, and, my friend assured me, the event would be worth\
  \ travelling for: Jarochos really knew how to party.\n\nLerdo, 2 hours south of\
  \ the tropical port of Veracruz on Mexico\u2019s Gulf coast, has a langorous, down-\
  \ at- heel air. Virtually everyone is overweight- nowhere in Mexico is the hegemony\
  \ of the Coca- Cola company more manifest than here- but they are handsome folk,\
  \ with glowing skin, and they laugh a lot. The town mushroomed in the 70s around\
  \ its twin sugar- cane processing plants, and has been in steady decline since the\
  \ U.S. abandoned Mexico for the Caribbean in a race to the bottom for the cheapest\
  \ sugar. Sandwiched between the plants\u2019 hulking chimneys, which billow blackly\
  \ over the town by day and emit eerie shrieks in the small hours to summon workers\
  \ to their shifts, the low-rise grid of streets teems with turkeys. The males cruise\
  \ main street ostentatiously while girlish gaggles hover on corners; occasionally\
  \ these are scattered by the arrival of a big yellow tricycle, resplendent with\
  \ its larger- than- life passenger, a pig, a small Mexican pedalling behind.\n\n\
  In Veracruz, it\u2019s all about the pigs.\n\nAs we had arrived 24 hours early for\
  \ the party, we were there when the pig destined for the birthday banquet was delivered.\
  \ Watching it heave itself down off the tricycle, I flinched at the dozy, amiable\
  \ face, and slept fitfully that night for intimations of murder outside. I was roused\
  \ at first light by Joaquin\u2019s mother and aunts, who had brought me, as guest\
  \ of honour, the best bit: the pig\u2019s tail, crispy and hot out of the fryer.\n\
  \nAfter bathing Lerdo- style in an old pig- feed bucket, I was taken through the\
  \ back of the house to a room where I could dress. There I encountered the stunning\
  \ spectacle of a 3- foot- high statue of the Christ child with gaudily painted face,\
  \ lovingly swaddled and lying on a bed. Joaquin's mother Zita solemnly explained\
  \ that her elderly mother liked to sleep cuddling the baby Jesus, for his comfort\
  \ and hers. Not knowing quite where to look while I processed this information,\
  \ I perused the few dog- eared photos on the walls, hung between rosaries, Coca-\
  \ Cola keyrings and a holographic image of the virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico\u2019\
  s patron saint. Zita took a photo down to show me: 'my fifteenth birthday' she said,\
  \ wistfully. The image was an arresting one. Zita stood beside a young man with\
  \ a long, gloomy- looking face and exuberant Afro, wearing a bowtie. Zita's round,\
  \ miserable face glowered out of the photo. She had on a flounced white dress as\
  \ wide as it was long, and dirty white stilettos. The background was nondescript,\
  \ with pig. They were ludicrously young, they were standing in mud, they appeared\
  \ to have been fighting, and Zita, on closer inspection, was heavily pregnant. 'Embarazada'?\
  \ I asked. 'Si!' she said- 'with Joaquin. It was my fifteenth birthday, and my wedding\
  \ day, too'. She smiled, sadly. \u2018My husband went to the other side, de Mojado,\
  \ she said. 13 years ago he left for the U.S.; the last time he came home was 6\
  \ years ago. I haven\u2019t heard from him since\u2019.\n\nWithin minutes, Zita\
  \ was all smiles and raucous laughter once again and later that night was to be\
  \ found dancing to Reggaeton among the revellers who still filled the street. The\
  \ pig had melted away on the tongues of a hundred guests seated on beribboned plastic\
  \ chairs while fifteen- year- old Esmeralda, a Disney princess vision in shimmering\
  \ turquoise, danced with cousin after cousin. \nThrough the crowd, I glanced a posse\
  \ of Joaquin's female relatives, including granny clutching a bundle. 'Oh look!\u2019\
  \ our mutual friend exclaimed: 'Joaquin's Abuelita is dancing with our lord Jesus\
  \ Christ\u2019."
