Text: "Where was I? I thought to myself as panic washed over me, sudden and fierce\
  \ like a Summer rain disrupting blue-sky bliss. \n\nI was on a dirt road headed\
  \ to a campsite in the western South Dakota Badlands. It was pitch-black. I had\
  \ no cell service, no GPS. If the road forked, I was screwed. \n\nI thought, if\
  \ I die this way, lost in the middle of nowhere, maybe attacked by a drifter or\
  \ wild animal, my family would resurrect me, say I told you so, then my dad would\
  \ kill me himself. I\u2019d embarked on this solo trip from Minneapolis to the Badlands\
  \ against their wishes. Despite knowing what they\u2019d say if they knew my current\
  \ predicament, or maybe because of it, I let my optimism and possibly twisted excitement\
  \ for the terror of the unknown triumph over fear and pressed on. I prayed my car\
  \ could handle all the jostling it was enduring from this so-called road. \n\nTo\
  \ my delight, I eventually reached the campsite, and it actually wasn\u2019t hard\
  \ to spot\u2014there were plenty of lights from vehicles and tents. \n\nI parked\
  \ my car, in which I\u2019d laid out a mattress pad and comforter, for a bed. I\
  \ had to sleep diagonally to fit, and though most people would have felt like a\
  \ sardine, at 5\u20192\u2019\u2019, I was short enough to stretch out fully. \n\n\
  After parking, I did a baby wipe \u201Cshower,\u201D changed, and settled in. I\
  \ was shot. I\u2019d started that day in the eastern-most part of the park, at a\
  \ much less sketchy campground. Setting out around 7, I\u2019d driven along the\
  \ road through the park, heading west, stopping at every designated viewpoint\u2014\
  one spectacular vista after the next. About halfway through, I\u2019d cut out to\
  \ the main road to get to nearby Mount Rushmore. In the evening, I headed to Rapid\
  \ City, where I\u2019d treated myself to a burger (For practicality and to save\
  \ money, I was subsisting entirely off mini cereal boxes, granola bars, and PB&J\
  \ sandwiches). I\u2019d headed toward the western campgrounds as night fell. \n\n\
  All of that caught up to me the minute I was settled, and as I waited for sleep\
  \ to come, a round of what-ifs hit me. What if I run out of gas driving through\
  \ the park tomorrow? What if I don\u2019t see any wild animals\u2014would this all\
  \ be for nothing? \n\nI\u2019d started this trip with a million what ifs and I want\
  \ to but\u2026s. I want to see the Badlands, but can I afford the expense? What\
  \ if I go and I\u2019m lonely? I want to go, but it\u2019s a lot of driving. What\
  \ if my car breaks down?\n\nBut after doing my usual over-thinker, indecisive thing\
  \ and debating myself in circles for days, I at last decided I was going, gosh dang-it.\
  \ So, at 7 am Saturday, I set out for my first national park adventure, my first\
  \ solo camping trip.\n\nI didn\u2019t know if I could hack it as the sleep-in-your-car\
  \ adventurer hippie I was trying to be. I didn\u2019t know if reality would live\
  \ up to the fantasy. Everything about how this crazy idea would play out was unknown.\
  \ But I knew if I didn\u2019t do it, I\u2019d never forgive myself. So, I took a\
  \ leap of faith\u2014that I could handle anything the trip threw at me.\n\nAfter\
  \ all, it\u2019s the leaps of faith that make the best tales. And sure enough, f\
  \ I had never leapt, and set out for that trip, I would have never known the rush\
  \ of clambering around wondrous rock formations to get to cliff edges that looked\
  \ out over an endless sea of Mother Nature-made castles and peaks of sediment\u2014\
  which became even more glorious under the orange-yellow hues of the setting summer\
  \ sun. \n\nIf I hadn\u2019t continued driving down that dirt road into the unknown,\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t have experienced the childlike joy of waking up to find a buffalo\
  \ just 20 feet from my car, then wound up smack dab in the middle of hundreds of\
  \ them crossing the road. \n\nThat moment, that whole trip, meant more to me than\
  \ I can say, and it all only happened because I leapt into that unknown."
