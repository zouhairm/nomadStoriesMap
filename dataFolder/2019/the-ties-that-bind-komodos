Text: "\"Help me pick tamarinds at the hill, will you? I'll make a delicious fish\
  \ soup for dinner.\"\n\nA family just arrived back at the village after gone fishing\
  \ to the sea for days. The mother then asked her children, two small boys, to quickly\
  \ found some tamarinds nearby. When they were about to back home, one boy stopped\
  \ in a bush to relieve himself shortly. In that brief moment, a Komodo attacked\
  \ him. \n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\
  \ \n\n\"That was the first time Komodo attacked the people in the village,\" Sidik\
  \ ended the story of an incident occurred twelve years ago. \"The only mistake the\
  \ Mother did was she didn't ask the boys to clean themselves first, to get rid of\
  \ fishy odour on their body.\"\n\nSidik is chief of a sub-village in Komodo Village,\
  \ Komodo Island, one of the prominent areas in Komodo National Park, East Nusa Tenggara.\
  \ Sidik was born as Atamodo or Komodo tribe, whose language also called Komodo.\
  \ Ever since the village existed in the 1930s, the eight-year-old-boy accident was\
  \ the only time Komodo has ever known to attack the Atamodo. The people always live\
  \ harmoniously alongside with the Komodos. It is believed that once a woman would\
  \ always give birth to two babies: a human and a Komodo. Hence, they never hurt\
  \ or hunt Komodos because both are blood-relatives. Even though the lizards wander\
  \ close to the village.\n\n\"A komodo attacked two of my goats this morning,\" a\
  \ man told me lightly as if he was talking about the weather. People keep goats\
  \ as the living fences to protect themselves from Komodos. The man pointed at the\
  \ cliff just beside his house, where I could see a glimpse of Komodo, peeping out\
  \ to the village.  \n\nKomodo National Park was registered in 1980, then is listed\
  \ in UNESCO World Heritage List in 1991. In 2011, Komodos became one of Seven Wonders.\
  \ The wonder that has put the living-fossil lizard as the main star in the Labuan\
  \ Bajo travelling ads. After two decades tourism has grown in this area, there are\
  \ no economic benefits earned by the village, except for the souvenirs trade or\
  \ tourist guide tips. All the tourism revenue goes straight to the region and national\
  \ government. Early this year, the provincial government announced surprising news:\
  \ Komodo National Park would be closed in 2020 for a year.\n\n\"We are definitely\
  \ against it,\" Sidik firmly declared his opinion. \"People in this village has\
  \ made most of their income from tourism. If this island closed for a year that\
  \ also means we have no income during that time.\"\n\nSidik has been working as\
  \ a Komodo researcher for seventeen years. So he knew exactly about the wrong facts\
  \ behind the closure: Komodos get thinner or the population is steadily decreasing,\
  \ when in fact, the population is stable around 4000-5000. Besides these reasons,\
  \ the Governor also implied that the entrance fee would raised up to USD500 for\
  \ international tourists and USD100 for domestic tourists. How much of it goes to\
  \ the people?\n\nPressures are keep coming in various ways: the difficulties to\
  \ have a senior high school in the village of 1700 people or some restrictions in\
  \ having homestay because their lands are accounted as a national park area. Recently,\
  \ the national park officials planned to to put a wired fence surround the people's\
  \ habitation, which already less than one-third of the island.       \n\n\"We will\
  \ fight against the closure,\" Asdar, a young man born in the village, restated\
  \ the people's wish. He then continued to talk about his dreams about his hometown.\
  \ After graduating from university, Asdar went home and gathered his young fellows\
  \ to create a movement. Their current missions are to collect historical and cultural\
  \ facts about Komodo Tribe and to start local tourism. A breath of fresh air for\
  \ Atamodos.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\
  \n\"So, what the people did to the Komodo?\" I asked Sidik about the incident a\
  \ decade ago.\n\"The people caught all komodos around the village then moved them\
  \ in other areas of the island. We managed to catch eight of them.\"\n\nBut Komodo\
  \ always finds its way home to Atamodo. Just like Sidik said, where there is an\
  \ Atamodo, there will be always a Komodo."
