Text: "I take my coffee seriously as demonstrated by my suitcase packing order:\n\n\
  1.  Passport\n2.  Coffee and tea (backup provisions)\n3.  Clothes, toiletries and\
  \ other stuff\n\nI love my morning ritual of a delicious cappuccino, preferably\
  \ consumed at a tiny table with perfect people-watching potential.\nI didn\u2019\
  t expect to find an outstanding cappuccino in the coastal village of Klongwan, a\
  \ short cycle ride from Prachuap Khiri Khan, my favourite hideaway in Thailand.\
  \ \n\nMy husband and I discovered Prachuap, as it is colloquially called, several\
  \ years ago. It\u2019s 100 kilometers south of the more famous town of Hua Hin.\
  \ Our favourite pursuits include strolling along the town pier in the early morning\
  \ and riding our bicycles around the military base at the nearby and very beautiful,\
  \ beach of Ao Manao. It\u2019s a lush paradise, where we have to stop to let planes\
  \ land before we race across the runway or pause to smile at the enchanting dusky\
  \ langur monkeys playing tag.\n\nLast November we were in transition in Prachuap\
  \ from our old life in Mandelieu-la-Napoule, France, where bitter black coffee is\
  \ strangely popular among the locals, to our new life in Brisbane, Australia, where\
  \ every caf\xE9 in the city churns out hundreds of barista kissed cappuccinos each\
  \ day.\n\nOn our morning bike ride we had discovered the seaside village of Klongwan\
  \ which is a couple of kilometres south of Ao Manao. As we precariously, threaded\
  \ our way around mangy dogs and wobbly tuk-tuks overflowing with vegetables, we\
  \ spied a caf\xE9 which had a place to park our bikes out front. Always a good sign.\n\
  \nAs we started removing our shoes the owner came out to open folding chairs to\
  \ facilitate the de-shoeing process before quickly returning indoors to crank up\
  \ the air-conditioning. It was elegant and calm inside and we were given the Wi-Fi\
  \ password as soon as we slumped into the comfy chairs, being careful to keep our\
  \ sweaty backs away from the lovely fabric.  A few minutes later our delicious cappuccinos\
  \ arrived on a golden tray. We soaked in the glorious nectar in the cool and calm,\
  \ while watching the buzzing fish market across the road.\n\nExcited at the discovery\
  \ of our little Shangri-La  we were disappointed the next day when we rode into\
  \ Klongwan to discover it was closed. \nThe following day as we cycled through the\
  \ village we were elated to discover that once again our little oasis was open.\
  \ As we were removing our shoes we noticed something glittery inside. Our host Warawan\
  \ rushed to greet us and to explain that she had spent the previous day shopping\
  \ for Christmas decorations. Now, not only was the caf\xE9 adorned in tinsel and\
  \ chintzy decorations but Michael Jackson was bellowing out 'I saw Mummy kissing\
  \ Santa Claus last night'. My husband was mortified. In hushed whispers he indicated\
  \ in no uncertain terms that this would be our last visit.\n\u2018But the coffee,\u2019\
  \ I pleaded. He shook his head, skulled his coffee and signalled for the bill.\n\
  \nHe paid and stood to leave. Warawan raced outside to unfold the plastic chairs\
  \ again for us to sit on while we \u2018re-shoed\u2019 for the ride back to Prachuap.\n\
  There was a tear forming in my eye as I waved goodbye and threw my leg over my bicycle.\
  \ My husband turned to me and said in his best Bogart voice, \u2018Don\u2019t be\
  \ sad. We\u2019ll always have Klongwan.\u2019"
