Text: "The Kid from the Antipodes\n\nOnce I heard that for most places in Earth the\
  \ Antipodes would be somwhere in the Ocean, as it doubles the lenght of the land.\
  \ In fact, that\u2019s more likely if you are from the Northern Hemisphere. When\
  \ you are born and raised in a coastal city of Argentina like me, antipodes means\
  \ somewhere around China.\nAfter several days riding a bike through different loops,\
  \ we arrived at Don Det, the largest island of Si Phan Don (\"Four Thousand Islands\u201D\
  ).\nI remember a child who came to play with us. That day, with that kid, I had\
  \ the feeling of being further away than ever, although perhaps it was not true.\
  \ Suddenly, I saw myself on an island in Laos, with the current communist flag,\
  \ on that small beach where sand and mud were the same thing. It ran, a few steps\
  \ away, the majestic Mekong River, witness of so many moments along my Asian trip.\
  \ It ran, this time, so fast that it was impossible not to be carried by the current.\
  \ Every once in a while, I felt the pricks of the little fishes eating the skin\
  \ of my feet.\nMy travel mates and I were struck by the knowledge and the expressions\
  \ the local made at his age. We communicated by gestures, or by mischief. Because\
  \ when language is a barrier, mischief is what most brings you closer to the other,\
  \ even when it comes to using gestures. For this kid, that came out through the\
  \ pores.\nHe started playing and he would not let me go, even if he had brothers,\
  \ even if there was a river, even if the rays of the sun invited him to look at\
  \ the horizon or play with the long shadows of the afternoon. But, of course, not\
  \ every day a foreigner appears wanting to have fun. So I was his war enemy, his\
  \ clown, his photographer. I was his horse, one so docile that endured it for a\
  \ long time although it never felt so much the smell of pee in its life.\nIt's weird,\
  \ but I remember those moments as if they happened a few hours ago. Maybe because,\
  \ somehow, from that feeling of being far away I could never go back. Days go by\
  \ and more and more, the city where I grew up seems less like me, less close. Maybe\
  \ it's just the idea of belonging. Perhaps it's to feel right now that one belongs\
  \ to the World and not to a small corner of it. Or maybe is just that possibility\
  \ of returning is a lie, because the soul of one is lost, entangled in landscapes\
  \ and distant people, floating between magical memories of secret places, crazy\
  \ experiences and some nonsense.\nThat day I knew I would never be the same back\
  \ home. Geographically, it may not be truth that Don Det is the Antipodes of my\
  \ hometown (Mar del Plata). But spiritually, it certainly was."
