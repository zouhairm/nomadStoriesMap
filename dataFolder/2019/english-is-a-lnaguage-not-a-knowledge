Text: "I was walking inside art&cultural centre in Bangkok, enjoying Binneale arts\
  \ from the artists all over the world and clicking photos in my camera. I was wondering\
  \ about the talent of the artists and tried my best to click better photos to respect\
  \ them. There were many tourists and student groups, I felt, it was not a time to\
  \ concentrate on the people but the beautiful creations only. \n\nI was trying to\
  \ get better photos of every art and a girl approached me with her camera and smiled.\
  \ I said Hi, she replied Hi too. She was asking something in local Language, but\
  \ I don\u2019t know what was it. \nI understood she don\u2019t know English.\nAgain\
  \ she started pointing my camera(she had a better camera than mine), so I understood\
  \ she wanted to check my photos.\nI said of course, then given my camera, she given\
  \ me her camera too.\nWhile she was checking my photos I tried to click some photos\
  \ with her camera.\nI showed my clicks, she was happy seeing it, she was blushing,\
  \ her eyes said she got excited.\nFrom the crowd, she held my hand and start walking,\n\
  I was following her, I felt like I am not in my control.\nHer hair was touching\
  \ my face, she doesn\u2019t talk anything.\nIn the crowd of bangkok she was taking\
  \ me to somewhere but I don\u2019t know where,\nI don\u2019t care actually, she\
  \ was so beautiful like I could spend days looking at her. \nWe changed metro to\
  \ local TukTuk service, then she ask me to get down, and she was leading me somewhere.\n\
  While walking, I was feeling more peace, we are going through a nice place away\
  \ from the city, I never expected this kind of place in Bangkok City,\nI was clicking\
  \ photos throught including her beautiful face.\nShe was trying to explain things\
  \ in her limited english knowledge. I tried understanding my best, she said she\
  \ will make me meet her teacher.\nAfter 30 minutes of walk, we reached at her college,\
  \ that is the only time I knew she was taking me to her college. It was an art college\
  \ with very few students as it was already evening and an off day.\nIt was an old\
  \ building with full of trees and planst, looks like at least 200 years old, the\
  \ college took my memory to my childhood where I studied in primary school, the\
  \ village of india the peace and calm of nature. I tried clicking the atmosphere\
  \ in my camera. She introduced me to her teachers and they were also hardly speaking\
  \ English, so she took me to a hall, where I found the art creation of students.\n\
  The paintings, pencil drawings, and many other form of art, I was amazed seeing\
  \ the talent of those students and I envy them that they are lucky to have that\
  \ campus. I clicked the photos of painitings(later I deleted the painting photos\
  \ as I felt I was not doing justice).\nThen she showed around the campus and was\
  \ explaining a lot of things which I had to catch from her actions. But time flew\
  \ very fast looking at her beautiful face and smile.\nIt was going to be dark, we\
  \ started waking back, as she explained I understood she lives nearby. She took\
  \ me to a local food place. We had food, she was so cute I felt that is the best\
  \ thing happened in whole thailand trip. Before leaving I took her to an art accessories\
  \ shop and gifted her a canvas and few colors of oil paints which she initially\
  \ disagree to accept. \nAnd the hardest part of the relationship is saying bye,\
  \ even if it is years long lasting or minutes only we met, she hugged me tight and\
  \ I could see the sadness in her face, I just hold her few minutes and said we will\
  \ meet again. I still remeber she was holding canvas and waving hands when I took\
  \ a taxi from there.\nI could not concentrate on anything that day. I flew Dubai\
  \ next day. \n\nFew days later one fine evening, I recieved a picture, \n\nA nice\
  \ fish 3D art in a canvas!!!"
