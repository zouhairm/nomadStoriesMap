Text: "Alberto and Pinuccia left Milan because they wanted to grow older in a quieter\
  \ environment, closer to nature. They moved to the Ligurian countryside at the Italian\
  \ northwest coast to produce vegetables, jellies and to try to live a more sustainable\
  \ life. It was my first day there. I was amazed by their house and farm, where I\
  \ was going to spend the next two weeks working in the vegetable garden and helping\
  \ with the kitchen and the agritourism\u2019s guests.   \nAs the sun fell down that\
  \ evening, the afternoon rain had finally stopped. My hosts asked me if I liked\
  \ music and arts. My response was not only with words but all my body expressed\
  \ a big YES! After more than a month in the countryside \u2013 this was my second\
  \ farm experience in Italy \u2013 I missed the cultural life from big cities. \n\
  \nWe drove for about twenty minutes until Sarzana. The village immediately transported\
  \ me to a cinema atmosphere. The old medieval style with wooden windows and big\
  \ doors with heavy metal lockers was completed by the color palette: beige, orange\
  \ and yellows from the walls that perfectly matched the colorful flower vases. \
  \ We walked through the main Piazza when the night started to reveal the first stars.\
  \ Shops were closed, the last workers were going home and the street was quite silent.\
  \ \nPassing by a merry-go-round in the main square, Alberto commented \u201CI do\
  \ not know why but a merry-go-round in a Piazza makes me feel melancholic\u201D\
  . I responded as if I naturally knew the reason: \u201CIt is because the Fellini\
  \ movies, there is always a merry-go-round in a Piazza and some human dilemma of\
  \ a character to be resolved.\u201D Then I realized that Sarzana was a village from\
  \ classics movies scenery. Alberto and Pinuccia smiled and we agreed that Fellini\
  \ was a master when it comes to recreating an image that reveals the Italian spirit.\
  \ \nWe then continued to walk through narrow streets with cozy lights. The next\
  \ stop was in a typical italian bar where you can ask for a caff\xE8 espresso at\
  \ any time. While we were having our coffees the barista started a conversation\
  \ with Alberto about the quality of prosciutto (ham)! He was arguing about its industrialization\
  \ process. I was astonished by the conversation. People do really know about food\u2019\
  s origin, if it is artisanal or industrialized or even how it is made. Pinuccia\
  \ realized how that simple episode caused an impression on me. She told me that\
  \ Italian gastronomy is a myth: \u201CItaly has as many dialects as traditional\
  \ foods. In order to preserve these many traditions, family members such as grandmothers\
  \ teach the importance of preserving family traditions and recipes to their grandchildren\
  \ starting from a young age.\u201D   \nWe continued the walk to our final destination\
  \ that night: a musical concert inside a Barroque church. The presentation was part\
  \ of the Sarzana Opera Festival 2017. As we walked towards the musical event, Pinuccia\
  \ explained to me that the village plays an important roel in Italy\u2019s cultural\
  \ and intellectual life. Once a year, since 2004, Festival della Mente (The Festival\
  \ of Mind), a great conference where important thinkers have the chance to spread\
  \ a word about their research and academic works take place there. It is like a\
  \ precursor of TED Conferences! Zygmunt Bauman was one of the major speakers in\
  \ 2011.\n\nWhen I entered the San Francisco church, or Chiesa di San Francisco,\
  \ I realized that small villages can be as cultural as big cities. It was crowded\
  \ with an enthusiastic audience. As the lights came down in the church a young girl\
  \ came in. Anastasiya Petryshak, a prodigious Ukrainian violinist, who was only\
  \ 22 years old, played the entire Four Seasons by Vivaldi as soloist. She was accompanied\
  \ by other musicians that backed her up, but the sound of violin echoing inside\
  \ the church transported everyone to another dimension! Even more impressively,\
  \ it seemed that for a moment everybody forgot about their smartphones and social\
  \ media to simply feel the moment and its solemn atmosphere. In the end, what I\
  \ thought it was just going be a nice concert, turned out to be an experience way\
  \ beyond my expectations."
