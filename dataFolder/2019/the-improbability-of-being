Text: "Hardly anything grows in Sarteneja. The sun is relentless. The ground is more\
  \ gravel than soil. It never seems to rain other than in short, exclamatory bursts.\
  \ Though every yard in the small Belizean fishing village seems to have a banana\
  \ tree, none show evidence of fruit.\n\nHardly anything moves in Sarteneja. The\
  \ iguanas step so slowly they\u2019re hardly walking. Faded fishing boats stay at\
  \ the dock, barely bothering to float. Even your sweat sits still, ripening on your\
  \ skin. \n\nImagine living in a painting forever and that\u2019s living here, in\
  \ the hot sun and the no rain and the faded colours and the long, quiet afternoons.\
  \ The heaviness of the air reminds you that serenity isn't always weightless.\n\n\
  The wind hardly ever blows in Sarteneja. Sometimes, along the dock, an ocean breeze\
  \ will catch you by surprise. The palm trees will continue to slouch towards the\
  \ earth, offering coconuts. Watching the ocean, I ask a villager if he could imagine\
  \ something as north as my native Canada. He laughs and says he can hardly imagine\
  \ as north as Mexico, whose border is 85 kilometres away.\n\nIn Sarteneja it\u2019\
  s not easy to be a fisherman. \n\nYou leave your family behind for days and work\
  \ long hours with little guarantee of a catch. The ocean moves violently\u2014perhaps\
  \ to make up for the village\u2019s stillness. You may not always weather the next\
  \ storm.\n\nBut in Sarteneja it isn\u2019t easy to be anything. \n\nAsk the guy\
  \ who drives around town for hours with a pickup truck full of produce for sale,\
  \ all the way from the south, Belize City, trying to move the fruit before it spoils\
  \ in the aggressive heat. Ask the teenage girls, bored, standing in the unintentional\
  \ irony of the four-aisle Sarteneja Superstore, watching their one ineffective table\
  \ fan strain and suffer and spit warm air back at them. Perhaps this not unique\
  \ to this town or these moments but simply illustrated in Sarteneja in a faded,\
  \ dried-out truth: It\u2019s not easy to be anything.\n\nJust ask Chuy.\n\nChuy\
  \ used to be a fisherman. He learned to paint by writing the names on fishing boats.\
  \ He got tired of being away from his family, of the dangerous ocean, of the uncertainty\
  \ of a catch.  \n\nAs he tells me, the only thing he could be sure of was his kids\
  \ growing bigger while he was away. He needed to find something more dependable\
  \ than what he could bring in on any fishing haul. He thought that with tourism\
  \ and a growing national interest in art, he could paint more than just the names\
  \ of boats.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how here, in the town where nothing grows and nothing\
  \ moves, not even the wind, a fisherman became an artist\u2014something improbably\
  \ difficult in any place but that feels divinely fantastical in this tiny, gorgeous\
  \ sand lot on the coast of nowhere, a two-and-a-half hour bus ride from anything\
  \ you\u2019d find on a map. \n\nChuy paints on cut-up cereal boxes from the not-so-Superstore.\
  \ He sells originals the size of a large coaster framed with popsicle sticks, four\
  \ for a twenty. The tourists love them\u2014especially the ones with palm trees.\
  \ There\u2019s nowhere in Sarteneja to buy his paints and brushes, or even anywhere\
  \ in northern Belize, so sometimes he makes do with leftover paint from the dock\
  \ until a friend can make the drive to Mexico and pick him up some fresh supplies.\
  \ \n\nChuy\u2019s more financially stable now than he\u2019s ever been. Outside\
  \ the trailer he and his family live in, he tells me the art scene is growing here\
  \ in Sarteneja, in Belize. He thinks next month he\u2019ll show some pieces to tourists\
  \ on the trendy islands of Caye Caulker, 189 kilometres away.\n\nHardly anything\
  \ goes to waste in Sarteneja. Chuy ties old fishing line into loops, so finished\
  \ paintings can hang from the trailer wall. In the centre there\u2019s a larger\
  \ piece. It\u2019s a sailboat on rough waters, dark silhouettes rushing across the\
  \ deck under a bright moon. A white dove flies in the stormy foreground: Hope. I\
  \ buy it immediately, and now, back north, look at it often, imagining what I can\
  \ be if even in Sarteneja, Chuy can be all this."
