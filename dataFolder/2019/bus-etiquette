Text: "Daily travel in Nepal, no easy feat.\n\nTo get to the village, to get to work,\
  \ to go to the shop to buy some rice. To get back to work, back to the village and\
  \ back home to cook the rice. You must take a ride on the local Nepalese bus. \n\
  \nNot an ordinary bus- A bus that could make a Guinness world record for \u201C\
  Most people to fit in one very small Bus at one time\u201D No rules apply. Except.\
  \ Well, the bus must move. \n\nA scenic route, but a challenging task. \n\nYou see,\
  \ there is no \u201Cgood spot\u201D on the Nepalese bus. Every spot comes with a\
  \ different set of challenges. Therefore  understanding Nepalese bus etiquette,\
  \ is an absolute must. Pushing is allowed. Step on toes, get your hands on someone\u2019\
  s shoulders.  Push, And push hard. Shove. Kick. Push.\n\nNow you know how to get\
  \ on the bus. But where to stand? See, the back appears spacious, you are almost\
  \ guaranteed a seat. You might be sharing with 4 people on 2 seats, but that\u2019\
  s ok....You still got a seat. You can relax and enjoy the ride. It\u2019s very scenic.\
  \ \n\nUntil. \n\nYou find yourself nearing your stop. You envision the pathway of\
  \ your near future. The distance from the exit door dawns and the anxiety kicks\
  \ in.Your smugness dissolves as you wriggle, stress and push your way through the\
  \ sardine packed crowd. But wait. your still on the bus? You missed your stop? Disadvantage\
  \ of the back: You will always miss your stop. So plan ahead 9 stops before your\
  \ own. \n\nDidn\u2019t fancy the back? Maybe try the middle? Riding the bus in the\
  \ middle offers a \u201Cget out of bus free card\u201D however, you may die of heat\
  \ exhaustion or worse, strangers armpit odour intoxication. On some occasions a\
  \ lady will toss you her baby while she argues for a seat. It will probably start\
  \ crying and you will be stared at. Maybe the middle isn\u2019t for you? \n\nThe\
  \ front? Same problem as the back. You can\u2019t get out. Shop keepers will often\
  \ decide to bring the whole shop with them. Bulk bags of rice, hoola hoops and chicken\
  \ cages. Helpful. \n\nWhy not try hanging on from the outside of the bus? This way\
  \ you have a  \u201Cget on get off\u201D type freedom. However, It means your going\
  \ to have to join the other 6 people hanging from the outside. A circus trick perhaps?\
  \ Yet little old ladies are doing it. \n\nSo that\u2019s the Nepalese bus for you.\
  \ It\u2019s chaotic, it\u2019s a a challenge and it\u2019s 10 cents a ride. Every\
  \ spot has its perks along with its quirks."
