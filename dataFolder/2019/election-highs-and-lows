Text: "I had only ever been to places I consider safe and normal.  When my boyfriend\
  \ asked me to join him on a journey to Honduras I immediately agreed.  Then...I\
  \ thought, \u201Cwhat have I done?\u201D  Once the travel plans were made I was\
  \ scared and anyone I talked to told me not to go because it isn\u2019t safe.  \n\
  \nIn the days leading up to my trip, I wrote a final will and testament, put it\
  \ in my nightstand, I was both nervous and excited.  \n\nWhen we arrived at the\
  \ airport in Honduras my boyfriend had a friend who picked us up.  Victor had a\
  \ car, which is rare among Hondurans, and he drove us to his hometown of Amoa. \
  \ When you check in to a hotel in Central America, it is common to view the room\
  \ prior to agreeing to a rate and checking in.  While we were viewing a room, the\
  \ sun was setting.  I wandered away from the group and to the deck overlooking the\
  \ ocean and captured a picture of one of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever\
  \ seen.\n\nThe Hondurans were welcoming and I felt safe in Amoa, away from the capital\
  \ city where things can be a bit different and not as comforting.  What we did not\
  \ anticipate was that Election Day was during our stay in Honduras.  \n\nHonduras\
  \ is under a regime that does not treat the people well, so an opportunity to vote\
  \ for change was a welcome day for many.  The country is a different place around\
  \ Election Day.  They don\u2019t serve alcohol in the country the day before the\
  \ election or the day after.  They don\u2019t want anyone getting so drunk and hungover\
  \ that they don\u2019t go to vote and they don\u2019t want drunk rioting after the\
  \ election.\n\nOn Election Day, the streets are empty and the shops are closed.\
  \  When they go to vote it isn\u2019t as organized or as high tech as it is in the\
  \ US.  They walk up to a card table and mark their vote in a notebook.  And to make\
  \ sure you don\u2019t vote more than once, they dip your pinky in indelible ink.\
  \  Your pinky then indicates to your friends and neighbors whether or not you have\
  \ participated in the process.\n\nIt was an incumbent vs. a businessman who was\
  \ running on a ticket for change.  On Election Day, the people were hopeful.  As\
  \ the returns were coming in and the news was on the television, the candidate for\
  \ change was wining by a landslide.  The mood in the country was that of excitement.\
  \  \n\nWe were on a bus traveling from Amoa to Copan and near populated towns the\
  \ traffic was stopped with people cheering and dancing.  The idea that life might\
  \ get better was overwhelming.  When we got to Copan, it was a party...there was\
  \ a band and people dancing in the town square.  \n\nI was taking video of the cars\
  \ driving around the square cheering and shouting.  As visitors we had to be careful\
  \ as we do not have rights to participate in any type of political rally.  \n\n\
  As the sun rose the next morning, hopes started to fall.  The counting had been\
  \ halted and without explanation, no additional results were being reported.  The\
  \ mood of an entire nation shifted from hopeful to angry.\n\nWe were in a curio\
  \ shop and there were several locals gathered around a television.  As I was looking\
  \ at a meaningless piece of pottery a man let out an audible groan and stormed out\
  \ of the shop.  The election returns had started again and the lead was changing\
  \ over to the incumbent and you could feel the tension in the shop.\n\nWe flew out\
  \ that evening and the news continued to lean towards the incumbent.  The natives\
  \ took to the streets and roads were closed.  Violence ensued, another day and we\
  \ would not have been able to get to the capital to fly out.  We would have had\
  \ to reroute through Guatemala, a small inconvenience compared to what the people\
  \ of honduras now face....4 more years of no change."
