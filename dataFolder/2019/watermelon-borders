Text: "It must have been at least 40C degrees, when we got off the minibus and were\
  \ hit by the air so hot that we moved our heads and hands repeatedly and rapidly\
  \ in attempts of finding fresh air. I looked around to understand where exactly\
  \ we were. \"Not the place I would choose to be stuck in\" I thought. As I have\
  \ taken the road to the south of Armenia more times than I can count, the watermelon\
  \ fields in front of me and the brown-yellow mountains behind them quickly let me\
  \ know that we were driving on the highway along the border of Nakhchivan and Armenia,\
  \ where the war took place nearly three decades ago.\nMy thoughts were quickly interrupted\
  \ as the old ladies selling watermelons on the side of the highway yelled \"Come,\
  \ come!  Come under the covers or you will melt\" they laughed. For a few kilometers\
  \ there was nothing but watermelons growing, after that grapevines and the wine\
  \ region would start. As we crossed the road, we were quickly welcomed into a small\
  \ room-sized shelter. Being the only one on the bus who spoke Armenian, I introduced\
  \ myself and the five tourists to the locals.\nAt least 50 watermelons on sale,\
  \ a crooked bed which once probably used to be a sofa, a big sharp knife and a wooden\
  \ table. These became our companions for the next 2 hours as we waited for the second\
  \ minibus to arrive. These and the stories that Tatik shared with us, the woman\
  \ who openly welcomed us into her little cozy \"watermelon-shop.\"\nTatik effortlessly\
  \ cut a huge watermelon in half, then into six great pieces, offering each one of\
  \ us red fresh tastiness and telling us it is important to stay hydrated. She then\
  \ went on talking about her name, Tatik, which in Armenian means Grandma, as so\
  \ many people in her village call her that way, she no longer responds to her real\
  \ name, which is ironic, as Tatik liked talking about her youth years. From how\
  \ she got married to having 6 children, leaving her village and helping build a\
  \ new village from the ground, I learned more about her generation and the war than\
  \ I ever did from history books.\nTatik took us on a journey, and throughout it,\
  \ I kept wishing that no one would raise any questions. \"Why did they need to move?\"\
  \ and \"What happened to her home village?\" were the ones I was particularly dreading.\
  \ As if avoiding them would mean that her village was never destroyed or that Tatik\
  \ did not see borders shifting and her whole world changing, all when she was in\
  \ her 20s. As if avoiding them would somehow change her past.\nHowever, Tatik had\
  \ a sense of simplicity in her stories that made everyone in the room feel like\
  \ the harsh circumstances she had to go through were somehow more bearable than\
  \ they seemed. Her stories taught us that you can make the best out of any situation,\
  \ even if all you have to offer in a radius of a few kilometers with unmanageable\
  \ heat is a watermelon.\nI could not find the words to explain why I felt guilty\
  \ of being born in a different generation, one that does not have a physical memory\
  \ of war. Being only 2 generations apart, it felt infinitely unfair how different\
  \ my life is from hers, simply because of slightly different timing and location,\
  \ in which I had absolutely no say and credit.\nBefore our bus arrived, we exchanged\
  \ a few jokes, got lost in the translation between English and Armenian, played\
  \ a word-game on city names, ate more watermelons than we had ever eaten in our\
  \ whole lives, and left with each one of us reflecting to ourselves Tatik's story\
  \ through our own experiences, our own cultures and our own pasts. \n\"Ah, youth!\
  \ Cherish it. And have a safe trip.\" were the last things Tatik said as she put\
  \ a massive watermelon in our hands as a parting gift."
