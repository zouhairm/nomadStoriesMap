Text: "It was last summer that I met him at The Front Door in Galway, Ireland.\n\n\
  August 2nd, the eve of my 29th birthday, to be exact.\n\nThis was my first trip\
  \ to Europe and my first experience as a solo traveler. Taking my friends\u2019\
  \ advice, I had booked the spontaneous trip to the Emerald Isle in order to experience\
  \ a much-needed escape from my work stresses and to treat myself for my birthday.\n\
  \nJoining a tour group, I met fellow Canadian travelers along with other solo travelers\
  \ from around the world. Following the lead of our friendly Irish tour guides, I\
  \ and my new friends enjoyed a slew of adventures as we explored castles, learned\
  \ about Irish folklore, drank some Guinness and gallivanted throughout the Irish\
  \ countryside. When the final day arrived, I and my new friends decided that we\
  \ would enjoy one final hurrah \u2013 of drinks and live music at a popular Galway\
  \ pub known as The Front Door \u2013 before saying our goodbyes and going our separate\
  \ ways. \n\nSo as I sipped on my cider while listening to the cover band play The\
  \ Beatles\u2019 \u201CHere Comes the Sun\u201D and singing along with my friends\
  \ by my side, I felt a mixture of joy and sadness as the sun would soon be setting\
  \ on my Irish adventure.\n \nWhen the song came to an end, I swallowed the last\
  \ drop of my cider and went back to the bar to order a second.\n\n\u201CLet me pay\
  \ for that,\u201D offered a gentleman standing next to me, who looked to be my age\
  \ or a couple years older.\n\nPleasantly surprised, it took me a moment to respond\
  \ with \u201COh thank you so much but you don\u2019t have to\u201D as I smiled and\
  \ looked up at him.\n\n\u201CPlease, I insist,\u201D he said with a charming Irish\
  \ accent, smiling back at me as his green eyes appeared to twinkle in the dim glow\
  \ of the bar lights. \u201CBy the way, I\u2019m Adam.\u201D\n\nAfter saying cheers\
  \ and clinking our drinks together, the rest of the night I felt like I was literally\
  \ swept off my feet and floating through a magical reverie. \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019\
  s your favourite karaoke song?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201CDefinitely The Four Seasons\u2019\
  \ Oh What a Night. I\u2019ve sung that onstage at pubs on more than one occasion,\u201D\
  \ he said with a laugh.\n\n\u201CI love that song! I\u2019d love to hear you sing\
  \ it someday,\u201D I said.\n\n\u201CMaybe you will,\u201D he said with a mischievous\
  \ twinkle in his eye.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too long afterwards that my tour mates found\
  \ me with my Irish Prince Charming.\nAfter introducing him to my friends, during\
  \ which they gave me looks that said \u201Ctell us the whole story later\u201D,\
  \ Adam briefly left to talk to the band during their 10 minute break.\n\nWhen he\
  \ came back, he whispered in my ear \u201CI\u2019ve got a surprise for you\u201D\
  .\n\nI looked him in the eye, saying \u201Cwhat do you mean?\u201D.\n\nHe gave me\
  \ a playful wink as my friend announced \u201C6 minutes until Celina\u2019s birthday!\u201D\
  \n\nAfter throwing back a round of birthday shots, the band started up again and\
  \ I was surprised to see Adam hop onstage with them.\n\n\u201CGood evening ladies\
  \ and gents, I\u2019m happy to have the chance to sing a song for a special Canadian\
  \ girl I met tonight,\u201D Adam said to the cheering crowd as my friends pulled\
  \ me towards the front of the audience. \u201CCelina, this one\u2019s for you. Happy\
  \ birthday and I hope you\u2019re having a grand time tonight.\u201D\n\nAdam then\
  \ nodded to the band who began playing that iconic melody as he began singing \u201C\
  Oh, what a night. Late December back in '63. What a very special time for me. As\
  \ I remember, what a night\u201D.\n\nLike a true rockstar, he emanated pure charisma\
  \ as he got the whole crowd dancing and singing along \u2013 and maybe it was partly\
  \ due to my tipsy state, but I couldn\u2019t help but swoon over this handsome Irishman\
  \ who was serenading me with The Four Seasons. \n\nOnce he got to the chorus, he\
  \ looked directly at me as he sang the words \u201CI was never gonna be the same.\
  \ What a lady, what a night.\u201D"
