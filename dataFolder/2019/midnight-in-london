Text: "The sun shone brightly as I got off the plane. Blinking I stare into the brightness.\
  \ It\xB4s a beautiful day on this island. Actually, I expected a grey sky and rain,\
  \ as I was told it\xB4s always raining in London. But I seem to be fortunate today.\
  \ Today. The first day of my semester abroad. The first day of 186 days I would\
  \ be spending in this unknown place. Quickly, I reach for my sunnies and turn on\
  \ the music on my headphones. Adventure awaits, and I\xB4m so ready for it. \n\n\
  One of my favorite stories I tell about why I wanted to come back to this city so\
  \ badly is, that I fell in love with it the first time I had come here, at the age\
  \ of 12. Now I\xB4m 25 and I\xB4m still drawn to this place like a magnet. To convince\
  \ you that this city is worth paying a visit - actually it\xB4s worth plenty - I\
  \ could easily tell you about all the generic touristic things you have to do here,\
  \ but instead, I want to tell you about a little bar I fell in love with during\
  \ the first term: the Balabam. \n\nI\xB4m a sucker for Jazz music, especially relaxed\
  \ live music in small and moody bars, where musicians drink wine from the bottle\
  \ and play away passionately like they are alone on this planet. There is something\
  \ intimate to it, something mystical, something magical. Something I only experienced\
  \ once so far, in this place in north London, which we spotted randomly when visiting\
  \ a friend who lived close by. \nIt was a cold winter day, late January. I met up\
  \ with a friend in Seven Sisters. It was freezing, and it just started to rain.\
  \ So we chose to pay the next bar a visit. To enter the Balabam was quite a random\
  \ decision, as you can see. Faith? Perhaps. The bar welcomed us instantly with the\
  \ smell of food, wine, dust, and, most of all, music, that came from the stage on\
  \ the other side of the room. They were playing some smooth Jazz, a song I didn\xB4\
  t know. It was like entering a dream. Hit by nostalgia, I felt like Gil Pender in\
  \ Midnight in Paris, suddenly transported into another era. A time without having\
  \ to worry about assignments, but filled with music, art, and poetry. People were\
  \ chatting, laughing, drinking, and dancing carelessly.  Usually, I\xB4m a rather\
  \ introvert person, but this night I talked to strangers about the most arbitrary\
  \ topics, danced unbridled, and even fell in love. \nWe ended up spending all night\
  \ in this bar, and when they closed down it was already dawn. Leaving the bar -\
  \ through the same door we had entered it only a couple of hours ago, but what seemed\
  \ to be part of another life - we were hit by the cold. Throughout the whole way\
  \ home, we remained silent, caught up in our own thoughts. Unnoticeably, the rain\
  \ had become snow falling in big flakes, covering the streets in white."
