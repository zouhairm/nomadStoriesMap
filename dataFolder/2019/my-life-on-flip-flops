Text: "The life I easily get used to living in. The life where I became friends with\
  \ a cockatoo, a dog, three cats, five goats were of two just born, another dog and\
  \ two lizards. \nThe life where I was permanently tanned and the life I made heaps\
  \ of stories. So I shall tell you a bit about that life.\nIt all started in January\
  \ 2018 when I decided to go to Australia for a \u2018short\u2019 trip for only a\
  \ few months. Always travelled and always loved to travel and soon I understood\
  \ that I wanted to stay there longer. So lived in Australia for about a year and\
  \ travelled to New Zealand, Fiji and Indonesia before I returned, temporarily, back\
  \ home in the Netherlands.\n\nFrom winter in the Netherlands, I arrived midsummer\
  \ in Australia. With some days temperatures of 46 degrees Celsius, the flip-flop\
  \ life started immediately. Didn\u2019t know I loved my flip-flops so much. Lived\
  \ near Melbourne for a while to help with a big project to build an eco-friendly\
  \ house. Life was good, amazing people, good weather and great sunsets. Later I\
  \ moved on and stayed in Melbourne for a while where I got some \u2018nice' stories\
  \ about the hostel life, where I saw penguins and where I got totally surprised\
  \ when a random dude came up to me and asked me out. This all happened on flip-flops;\
  \ we became friends for life.\n\nTravelled along the east coast up. Came along Sydney,\
  \ hiked in the Blue Mountains, went to Byron Bay, cold coast and then arrived in\
  \ Brisbane. Life was hard because my friends and I were more separated, at the hikes\
  \ in the mountains, I wore hiking boots. Byron Bay was \u2019cold\u2019 and rainy\
  \ so also no flip-flops there. We started to miss each other. Where was the trust\
  \ that we always had each other's feet? Cold coast it was nice and warm again, freed\
  \ my flip-flops out of my backpack and became best friends again.\n\nAfter Brisbane,\
  \ I flew to New-Zealand. A little bit colder since it was autumn already. New-Zealand\
  \ is beautiful! Nature there is amazing. All these differences. Mountains, rain\
  \ forest, beaches. More hikes. I enjoyed it. Totally forgot about my friendship.\
  \ Slowly my flip-flops got lower and lower in my backpack and further back in my\
  \ mind. Became better friends with my hiking boots. Together we hiked Roys Peak,\
  \ Fox Glacier and more.\nAt the time we arrived in Queenstown, it started snowing,\
  \ I unconsciously had switched from friends. My flip-flops, deeply hurt, lonely\
  \ and squeezed at the bottom of my backpack. We shared anything, right? \nMy hiking\
  \ boots even joined me on the Nevis swing, the biggest swing in the world. (Although\
  \ I think my flip-flops wouldn\u2019t like the swing anyway\u2026)\nAlso together\
  \ we passed the Tongariro alpine crossing. Beautiful hike! Seriously, amazing. It\
  \ is over several mountains and through great nature. It\u2019s a day hike, with\
  \ a lunch break and some picture breaks, it took us 7 hours to get the end.\n\n\
  From New-Zealand, we flew to Fiji. There it was of course back to the flip-flop\
  \ life. But it wasn't that easy. Seriously hurt and lost its trust in our friendship.\
  \ So we had to work on that. Promised for better times and that we were going to\
  \ work on our friendship.\nSlowly the trust came back and again we made new stories\
  \ together.\nFirst the paradise part of Fiji! On the Yasawa islands where the beach,\
  \ palm trees, sunsets and cocktails were the daily thing.\nLater on the big main\
  \ island, we saw the real Fiji life.\n\nBack to Australia. I thought by this time\
  \ everything was fine and we were as the good old times best friends. Well, apparently\
  \ I had seriously damaged something. One day when it was very hot, my flip-flops\
  \ got so hot that they gave me blisters, never done that before. \nWell after that\
  \ we both learned our lesson, we all lived happily ever after and celebrated our\
  \ friendship on Bali. I didn't expect to find this friend for life!"
