Text: "Sun kissed skin and windswept hair by the sea. Live music by local artists.\
  \ A meet up with a celebrity. Streaks of orange as you sip on a cocktail watching\
  \ the sun disappear behind the mountains. These are the make ups of a dream day--the\
  \ product of meticulous planning. Would you believe it if I told you that none of\
  \ it was supposed to happen? \n\nThe day was meant to contain a tour of Robben Island\
  \ to learn about South Africa\u2019s brutal history of apartheid. I was to go with\
  \ a girl I had befriended the night before, Yvonne. However, the boat ride to Robben\
  \ Island got canceled due to unsafe waters. This left our schedule wide open. We\
  \ did the only sensible thing we could: bought beers and walked around the waterfront\
  \ gazing dreamily out at the white, foamy waves in the sea and taking in the sounds\
  \ of local musicians performing their hearts out. \n\nWe eventually made our way\
  \ back to the marketplace for lunch. As we sat eating she asked, \u201CDo you ever\
  \ dream of quitting your job and this just being...your thing?\u201D\n\n\u201CAll\
  \ the time.\u201D \n\nThe question had barely left her mouth before I answered.\
  \ \n\n\u201CLet\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s travel the world together.\u201D\n\nWhether\
  \ these fantasies would ever come to fruition was hardly the point. In that moment,\
  \ it was reality. \n\nVulnerability is a scary thing, but when on the road it seems\
  \ to happen a lot more than you might expect. It is incredible the amount of emotional\
  \ freedom and safety you can feel with nearly a complete stranger. I opened up about\
  \ dreams and insecurities that I scarcely share with my closest friends back home.\
  \ For an American boy and a German girl meeting in Cape Town, there was no danger\
  \ of our transparency tracing back to anyone. We were safe to share anything we\
  \ liked. In addition to sharing the day together, we shared our lives.\n\nWe did\
  \ everything our whims dictated. After having explored the waterfront sufficiently,\
  \ it felt time to get a move on. We noticed a rooftop bar. \n\n\u201CShould we\u2026\
  ?\u201D\n\u201CYeah we should.\u201D\n\nThat was all it took to direct our steps,\
  \ and before long we were jamming to house music on a rooftop sixteen floors up,\
  \ dangling our feet in a pool, and sharing about our lives back home. She told me\
  \ about how life had become too mundane and filled with routine and how she had\
  \ quit her job and come to South Africa. If it is possible to fall in love with\
  \ the idea of someone after only knowing them a day I think I had managed it. We\
  \ saw another rooftop much higher up where life seemed to stir. \n\nWe had to know.\
  \ We had to explore. So we did. \n\nWe sipped cocktails and watched the sunset together\
  \ dreaming aloud simultaneously of a life together on the road with each day carrying\
  \ the same magic as the moments we were breathing. The crowning moment of our adventure\
  \ came when we were asked to switch tables to make way for a party. Once the party\
  \ arrived we realized we had been seat warmers for Miley Cyrus. Yvonne got a selfie\
  \ with her while I managed a couple of awkward exchanges between drooling over her\
  \ from across the bar. \n\nI don\u2019t know if Yvonne and I will ever see each\
  \ other again, much less travel the world together. I hope so. Even if we don\u2019\
  t, however, our time together fulfilled a purpose simple yet sensational--all because\
  \ our plans fell through. It filled me with hope. With excitement. Our conversations\
  \ brought life back into me in a way I had not felt in a long time. Our spontaneous\
  \ adventures reminded me that any moment of life can be unexpectedly dazzling. Yvonne\u2019\
  s story of quitting her job to travel inspired me. It infused me once more with\
  \ dreams. Having been struggling with depression, this was monumental. I found purpose\
  \ again; I found myself. I expected a good day. I expected to make a new friend.\
  \ I expected a solid history lesson. I could not have planned for what I found instead."
