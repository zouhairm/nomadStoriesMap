Text: "We were eating Cuban sandwiches at an outdoor caf\xE9, the first stop after\
  \ getting on the bus from the airport. We sipped on our Coca-Colas and excitedly\
  \ guessed about what the students from California were going to be like. We did\
  \ not even know how many of them there were going to be, but we knew that for the\
  \ next week we would be spending every second of the trip with them. Finally, one\
  \ of the many tour buses we saw passing by pulled over, and I noticed him before\
  \ he even got off the bus. \nAfter lunch, we drove two hours through a beautiful\
  \ jungle like landscape until we arrived at a lagoon. We took turns passing our\
  \ luggage down onto different speed boats before being whisked off under the setting\
  \ sun to our floating rustic hotel. That morning I woke up, opened the back door\
  \ of my little hut, and climbed down the latter onto a tiny boat of my friends while\
  \ the sky was still grey. We watched the sunrise from the middle of the water and\
  \ spotted many different types of birds. After the sun rise the boats took us to\
  \ the main building where breakfast would be held. That was the first time I talked\
  \ to him. \nThat day we walked around the beautiful cobblestone streets of Trinidad\
  \ visiting churches and drinking Havana Club. A Cuban man excitedly showed us a\
  \ newspaper featuring a picture of Barack Obama, with a headline about the new Cuban/American\
  \ relationship. Obama came to the beautiful country a week later and was the first\
  \ president to visit Cuba in a century. Everywhere we went the Cuban people were\
  \ so excited to see Americans, and every place we visited just got more beautiful.\n\
  The next place we stayed was a hotel that consisted of a bunch of little houses\
  \ that were just one or two bedrooms each, along a pathway descending down the edge\
  \ of a cliff, leading to a dock stretching out into the Ocean and pointing straight\
  \ towards a never-ending view of the water meeting the sky, with a beautiful cliff\
  \ on one side, and the hotel on the right. \nWe were going to go swimming off of\
  \ the beach but one of the hotel staff warned us about a fish that was dangerous\
  \ over there, so I ran off the dock, and I watch him follow me. We splashed around\
  \ in the water not caring about what dangerous fish could be at our feet, and then\
  \ the rest of our group came running onto the dock playing music and jumping in.\
  \ We were all so happy to be there.\nThat night we had salsa lessons after dinner,\
  \ I didn\u2019t end up dancing with him, but he watched me dance anyway. We walked\
  \ around the hotel grounds after hours visiting our friends from the group, he was\
  \ staying right next door. He came outside and went with us to the docks. Before\
  \ we got there, he grabbed my hand and turned me around. I asked \u201Cwhere are\
  \ we going?\u201D and he led me back up the path and to the vacant pool. We sat\
  \ on one of the pool chairs, we talked about our lives back home and he kissed me.\
  \ We sat on the edge of the pool with our feet in the water and looked up at the\
  \ stars. I didn\u2019t even wonder what was going on back home. \nA lot can happen\
  \ in a week, a lot can happen in a country that you would have never expected to\
  \ visit. Cuba had beautiful beaches, beautiful cities, beautiful and kind people.\
  \ We went to different museums, memorials, a Santeria worship, and even had lunch\
  \ with a woman who sat at multiple dinners with Castro. I saw a peacock walking\
  \ around a restaurant at the same time learning about a political idea I never fully\
  \ understood. I had no idea I was going to fall in love with Cuba the way that I\
  \ did, and even less of a clue that I would fall in love in Cuba."
