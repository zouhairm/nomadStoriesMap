Text: "My home is a small cottage, in a petite little village in the ancient Langededoc\
  \ region. The village is called Labastide Esparbairenque, a place whose letters\
  \ in its name almost outnumber its inhabitants. There are just 54 people living\
  \ here full time in the row of houses that face out towards a spectacular view of\
  \ the valley. Most have lived here all their lives and have ages that start with\
  \ the numbers 7,8 and 9. A visit to the local graveyard proves that mountainous\
  \ living is good for you. For one thing only a third of the graveyard is occupied\
  \ with all of those interred having lived for almost 100 years according to the\
  \ dates etched into the marble marking the their lives.\n\nThe graves here are more\
  \ like crypts, above ground, due to the excess rainfall that hits in winter. One\
  \ such crypt in the corner of the graveyard beside a rose bush has the name \u2018\
  Ernest Garcia\u2019 emblazoned across it in gold lettering. Which is rather worrying\
  \ because Monsieur Garcia is alive and well, in fact I passed by him this morning\
  \ on my way to the source, the spout where clean and clear mountainous water flows\
  \ freely keeping us all hydrated in this hot summer sun. \u2018Bonjour\u2019 I said\
  \ to this spritely 94 year old who walks up steep hills with a cane and a weaved\
  \ basked slung over his shoulder containing legumes fresh from his garden. He became\
  \ the most eligible bachelor round here after his wife Luciene died nine years ago.\
  \ It is in fact Luciene who occupies the grave. Even though it\u2019s her husbands\
  \ name which is emblazoned across it. I eventually noticed the words \u2018wife\
  \ of\u2019 written in small carvings just to the side of his name. And in the corner\
  \ of the bottom part of the crypt a small faded picture of her, the year of her\
  \ birth, the year of her death and her name  is etched in gold.\n\n\n\nMonsieur\
  \ Garcia is a \u2018fan of the ladies\u2019, according to John, the owner of the\
  \ retreat here, who advised me on my first day that if I wanted to buy eggs I could\
  \ buy them from him but that I was to ensure I didn\u2019t allow him to get too\
  \ close as he tended to have wandering hands and a twinkle in his 94 year old eyes.\
  \ \n\nAnd believe me I\u2019ve added at least another 7kgs of flaw to my body since\
  \ I got here. I have tried to excercise every day, but nothing will stop the softness\
  \ that has crept across my belly and my hips, evidence of the copious amounts of\
  \ cheese and wine that has passed my lips almost every night. Not that I regret\
  \ it. I have enjoyed every morsel. I have savoured every crouton, topped with fromage,\
  \ slathered in juicy fig jam. Every glass of wine I drank in the company of my new\
  \ found friends passed down my throat where the echo of a laugh still lingered.\
  \ My mother told me to enjoy every moment while I was here,  it just so happened\
  \ that lots of those moments have involved food and I sure have taken her advice\
  \ quite literally.  \n\nSo now, well now there is just more of me to love.\n\nTinder\
  \ in my tiny french village is not exactly hopping, and while I had hoped to kiss\
  \ many a Frog while here but sadly the lily pads around me remain unoccupied.\n\n\
  Maybe Mr Garcia has eaten them all, I hear he is partial to a frogs leg or two.\n\
  \n\nI realise of course that there are often other women in these fairytales we\
  \ get fed as children. The mean old witches who lure people to their fate with things\
  \ like breadcrumbs and poisoned apples. I hope I do not end up like one of them.\n\
  \nBut if I do, I\u2019m definitely going to live in a house made of cheese with\
  \ a free flowing fountain of wine.\n\nAt least then when I die I\u2019d have the\
  \ crypt all to myself, my name alone emblazoned across the top.\n\n\u201CHere lies\
  \ the wicked old witch ...who always believed in love\""
