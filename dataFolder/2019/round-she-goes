Text: "I am often asked what was the impetus for my sailing dream.\n\nTruth be told,\
  \ I\u2019ve always been drawn to water, from my youth growing up on Lake Michigan\
  \ to my travels along the shores of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. I started taking\
  \ sailing lessons in my early adulthood, but something \u2018more important\u2019\
  \ always diverted my attention away from sailing (e.g. work, more work, relationships,\
  \ shiny silver things, etc).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the last dream I was living\
  \ (moving to New York City and establishing a career) had long since become a reality\
  \ and had left me feeling stuck, that I began craving a new adventure. I seriously\
  \ began considering the possibility of a global circumnavigation in 2008.\n\nI had\
  \ been chartering sailboats with a childhood friend who was \u2018living her bucket\
  \ list\u2019 after being diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. She taught me to\
  \ enjoy the moments and pursue a dream while I was able.\n\nI enjoyed traveling\
  \ and taking in the great outdoors in the comfort of my temporary \u2018sailing\
  \ home\u2019. I welcomed the simplicity of sailing, needing only to take along the\
  \ essentials, leaving everything superfluous behind. I felt a meditative sense of\
  \ calm and connectedness while on passage. Time would stop. Life was clarified.\
  \ Everything seemed to make sense. I wanted more of this experience and thus my\
  \ new dream was formed.\n\nAt first, I was too fearful to follow my dream. I thought\
  \ that I would jeopardize the career that I loved and had taken so long to build\
  \ and that I could not afford to undertake such an adventure. I thought that my\
  \ friends, colleagues, and family would think I was crazy and irresponsible and\
  \ that I would fall flat on my face. It was only when the fear of not following\
  \ my dream became greater than all of my other fears that I decided to \u2018lift\
  \ anchor\u2019. None of my fears materialized. In fact, quite the opposite occurred.\n\
  \nIn 2011, I resigned my position (and was subsequently offered an 8-month leave\
  \ of absence) to earn my RYA Yachtmaster Offshore certification and cross the Atlantic\
  \ Ocean as Watch Lead in the ARC (Atlantic Rally for Cruisers).\n\nI returned to\
  \ work in 2012 to successfully deliver the biggest project of my career.\n\nIn 2013,\
  \ I started my second \u2018sailbatical\u2019 to cross the Pacific as First Mate\
  \ aboard SY Amandla. A one-season voyage from Isla Mujeres, Mexico to Auckland,\
  \ New Zealand transformed into a three-year voyage to Sydney Australia, allowing\
  \ me to explore ports such as French Polynesia and Fiji more deeply and to fully\
  \ transit the Pacific before returning to work.\n\nMy career still beckoned me,\
  \ but the sea continued to hold sway. Job offers came in Australia and Singapore,\
  \ but the call to explore new lands and finish my circle aboard Amandla kept me\
  \ sailing onward across the Indian Ocean.\n\nI was euphoric as we rounded Cape Agulhas\
  \ before dawn on the summer solstice in December 2018, staying on watch an hour\
  \ longer just to savor the moment. 7 years ago, I\u2019d transited The Atlantic\
  \ for my first time. 5 and 1/2 year ago, I left her shores to sail The Pacific and\
  \ Indian. With this passage, I\u2019d returned home to her once again. Honestly,\
  \ I never thought I\u2019d make it this far.\n\nIf all goes according to plan in\
  \ 2019, I will have traveled a full-circle once I make landfall in St. Helena and\
  \ will complete my first circumnavigation when I cross my line in Panama in mid-2019.\
  \  \n\nI am amazed by how everything came together once I decided to go for it.\
  \ Even apparent glitches (failed relationships, health issues) along the way turned\
  \ out to be blessings in disguise and actually supported me on the journey.\n\n\
  Living my dream is not always unicorns and rainbows. Sometimes it can be a real\
  \ nightmare. However, even at its worst, it is much better than sitting around wishing\
  \ I was living my dream.  \n\nI remain on the fence as to whether to return to my\
  \ career as a Program Manager or sail around again. Perhaps both. I miss my former\
  \ life but there is so much more to be seen out there."
