Text: "As our 12m motor cruiser rounded steadily into western Comino's revered Crystal\
  \ Lagoon, a hypnotic patchwork of cyan waters, gleaming white sands and underwater\
  \ forests of khaki sea grass stretched out before me. Hugged by staggeringly high\
  \ limestone cliffs the colour of honeycomb, I realised this was the place I'd finally\
  \ learn to swim.\n\nI'd only heard of Comino ('Kemmuna' in Malti) when we'd set\
  \ sail for it earlier that day. Over a breakfast of chicken pastizzis, my boating\
  \ party's internet search had revealed a precipitous 3.5 square kilometre nature\
  \ reserve set between Gozo and Malta. Instantly, we'd been charmed by the island's\
  \ minuscule population (three), to say nothing of its cloak-and-dagger history as\
  \ a hideout for medieval pirates, who sought cunning refuge in its deep caves and\
  \ secret coves.\n\nBut it was only after we'd left the Blue Lagoon, Comino's star\
  \ attraction and the Crystal Lagoon's bigger brother, that I'd felt nearly thirty\
  \ years of deep-set terror take hold of my body. Plastic masks and snorkels had\
  \ been produced, and chatter had developed of diving and snorkelling, if only to\
  \ see the schools of friendly fish who were known to sidle up to visitors for crumbs.\n\
  \n\"The water here is safe,\" Captain Frankie promised me, as our cruiser anchored.\
  \ A Santa Claus of a sea dog, Frankie was sturdy and squat, with twinkling blue\
  \ eyes and olive skin bronzed from over 50 summers in the Mediterranean sun. \n\n\
  He pointed to the top of the vertiginous cliffs that encircled the lagoon and protected\
  \ it from fiercer sea currents. In the scorching mid-July heat, a small crowd of\
  \ swimmers were hurling themselves off the sharp edges, blurring into human bullets\
  \ as they rained one by one into the lagoon. Whoops of terrified joy bounced around\
  \ the cove, joined by the baritone smacks of soft bodies breaking deep water.\n\n\
  \"See? You will be OK.\"\n\nSomehow, I didn't believe him.\n\nLater, as I stepped\
  \ off the cruiser's ladder and into the gently lapping waves, I repeated Frankie's\
  \ words to myself like a feverish mantra. My heart began thudding into overtime.\
  \ This was one of the only times in my life where I'd been in water deeper than\
  \ I could stand. And yet, I didn't - couldn't - turn back.\n\nWheezing in one last\
  \ Darth Vader breath through my snorkel, I pushed my masked head into the great\
  \ unknown.\n\nEverything was quiet.\n\nResting atop 15m of pristine open water,\
  \ the cruiser now seemed to bob with otherworldly lightness. Shoals of silver saddled\
  \ bream, peeking at this new intruder with beady eyes, circled in lazy arabesques\
  \ above vast tufts of waving sea grass that turned the azure waters below green.\
  \ Towards the surface, the disembodied legs of other swimmers pedalled gracefully\
  \ in sync, their hands fluttering to join this silent underwater ballet.\n\nMy heartbeat\
  \ began to slow.\n\nBuoyed by the richly salient waters, I clumsily front crawled\
  \ towards a jutting cliff-side rock shelf an impossible 25m away. By the time I\
  \ slumped onto it, my head once again in the balmy Maltese air, my entire body was\
  \ ablaze. Deep, coarse breaths rasped in and out of my lungs. Every strained sinew\
  \ in my arms and legs burned, exhausted from the unfamiliar motions of dragging\
  \ my body across water. When I pulled off my now foggy mask to rinse it in the neck-deep\
  \ lagoon, my hands wobbled uncontrollably. \n\nResting against the amber-coloured\
  \ rock, the still beauty of the Crystal Lagoon laid bare, I felt a quiet sense of\
  \ bravado stir inside me. What I'd just achieved, over the last agonisingly slow\
  \ ten minutes, was something that for my entire life had been emphatically out of\
  \ reach. And yet, I'd always had everything I'd needed. What magic there was, to\
  \ sometimes just let go and trust that you would be caught. \n\nBack at the cruiser,\
  \ I hoisted myself up the metal sea ladder and onto the glistening white stern.\
  \ Frankie called to me from the bow - we still had another fifteen minutes before\
  \ weighing anchor.\n\nSmiling, I waved at him and twirled around to dive straight\
  \ back into the lagoon. But not before I heard Frankie laugh, as another cliff-diver\
  \ loudly met the sea's warm embrace."
