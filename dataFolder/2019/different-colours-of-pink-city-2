Text: "I'm currently in my final year undergraduation with  political science and\
  \ geography as my major disciplines. Right from my childhood I'm into travelling\
  \ (definitely to surrounding tourist places because of my family's economic condition).As\
  \ I'm growing up my love towards travelling keep escalating.Last November I went\
  \ to JAIPUR,capital city of state of Rajasthan in India. This city is popularly\
  \ known as PINK CITY. One part of this city is completely filled with pink houses\
  \ which I didn't expect. There is so much to explore and enjoy in this city.I don't\
  \ want this trip to be preplanned to enjoy the spontaneity. First I just roamed\
  \ the streets near the place which I stayed,then HAWA MAHAL is the first ever tourist\
  \ place I visited in Jaipur. From outside it's just a beautiful building with many\
  \ windows,and the beautiful five storeyed is beautiful in inside too if we see it\
  \ along with it's history. This mahal has got a beautiful scenery with mountains\
  \ in the backdrop if we see from the cafes around the streets.Next to Hawa Mahal\
  \ there are so many local shops in line which exhibits local handicrafts and articrafts.\
  \ This street with Hawa Mahal and shops is an eye feast in the evening with beautiful\
  \ lights on and that too I visited that place during Diwali(lights festival of India).This\
  \ is the place where I fell in love with the tourism of Rajasthan and the people\
  \ here are so welcoming.Next place I visited was CITY PALACE,It was the seat of\
  \ Maharaja(king) of Jaipur,where royal family still lives here.It is a very beautiful\
  \ sight to see and there are many things inside to see like clothes ,accessories\
  \ of different periods and their habits,courtroom,art room etc.Architecture of certain\
  \ parts of this palace was very amusing.\nNext in the evening,I just explored the\
  \ streets of jaipur and interacted with local people there.I went to Masala Chowk,food\
  \ street with cuisines of all states of India and I tried traditional Rajasthani\
  \ dishes and fell in love with them instantly.Later I went to Albert hall museum\
  \ which is very very beautiful in the night with lights on and roads surrounding\
  \ it.This pretty much ended my very first day. I spent my night talking to fellow\
  \ travelers in my backpackers' hostel which made me more to incline towards travelling.\n\
  Next day I planned to visit three major forts of Jaipur as it is the city with beautiful\
  \ forts.\nFirst I went to experience elephant ride at Amer fort .Elephant will take\
  \ travelers from bottom to the top at where fort is situated.This place is beyond\
  \ beautiful with mountains,lakes near the fort. Inside, we can see many unique features\
  \ of the fort like secret tunnels of kings,mirror hall,queens apatments which left\
  \ me with mouth \ndropping expression. Next fort I visited was Nahargarh fort which\
  \ is again another beautiful fort with water tank,step well and many more features\
  \ .I spent almost more than one hour just sitting there. Even the way from amer\
  \ fort to nahargarh fort was very refreshing. The last fort I visited was jaigarh\
  \ fort , it is a very massive fort with so many pre wedding shoots going around;p\
  \ ,yeah it has got some beautiful view points to feel and enjoy. On my way back\
  \ to hostel, I stopped to see Jal mahal which I'm luck I didn't miss this one.This\
  \ one situated right in the middle of the river surrounded by water four sides,\
  \ woah! A perfect place to spend a peaceful evening. Totally I was very satisfied\
  \ with this day . Later at night I explored many local streets and did some shopping\
  \ there.\nAlong with pink streets I got to know many colours of the city like golden\
  \ forts,colourful \nStreets,blue lakes,fancy cafes. If you're in India you must\
  \ visit this place.I can truly say this state is the hub of many tourist places\
  \ even I'm from southern part of India, I never seen such welcoming state before."
