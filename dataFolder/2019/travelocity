Text: "You dont always need a plan sometimes you just need to breathe,trust,let go\
  \ and see what happens.Travelling for the first time provided me with the wave of\
  \ heterogenous emotions.When I began my journey it was completely disparate.I was\
  \ utterly new and pristine.To remunerate for my dearth of readines,I went through\
  \ lots of tour sites.I was young and callow and made many novice mistakes.\n   There\
  \ was an unpleasant feeling triggered by the perception of danger, real or imagined.\
  \ But i was undaunted about it and managed to choose my dream destination.I chose\
  \ the port of call to be Venice-The land of canals.\n   Venice is fabled for its\
  \ canals and it is built on an archipelago of 118 islands formed by about 150 canals\
  \ in a trivial lagoon.It has around 400 bridges.The water transport is the main\
  \ means used there.\n    The dates I chose were between 7 October to 12 October\
  \ as the best time to visit Venice is frim September to November.But I did not know\
  \ from where to start.I was as tangled as Grandma's yarn.I sat there sequestered\
  \ and faint,took a deep breath and unlocked my laptop.I opened the site to solicit\
  \ for my visa.\n   Days passed by and only a week was left for my leao into the\
  \ unknown.I started cramming my suitcase with all the obligatory stuff.I made a\
  \ checklist and stuffed my bag exactlt according to it.\n   Finally the day approached.My\
  \ excitement and happiness was exorbitant.I checked in at the airport and embarked\
  \ my flight.I felt every bump and lift as the airplane soared into the air.I even\
  \ got the stomach drop\"roller coaster\" feeling for solicit seconds.Then finally\
  \ after 13 hours my Quatar landed on the Venice Marco Polo Airport.The airport was\
  \ magnificent and alluring.The people were different and winsome.After I came out\
  \ of the airport I took a water taxi and headed towards my hotel.Never before had\
  \ I travelled by a water taxi.It was some virtuous experience all together.That\
  \ day I decided to just recline at the hotel.\n   The very next morning I set myself\
  \ in motion.I boarded the water taxi and headed towards Piazza San Marco,commonly\
  \ known St.Mark's Square.It is the principal public square of Venice.I learnt from\
  \ the local people that it is known a just la Piazza.The square was dominated at\
  \ its eastern end by the great church of of St.Mark.I was litrally amused by the\
  \ beauty and the way they had perpetuated the church as well as the srautues inside.After\
  \ a captivating day I moved back to the hotel and geared up for the next day.\n\
  \   The new day emerged. I was looking forward for something fresh and alluring\
  \ for the day.I was all set to vist the Dodge's palace.When I reached there I saw\
  \ a huge and massive palace in front of me.It still seemed so young.This place is\
  \ the best place for and art lover and an architect.\n   The third day I was certain\
  \ and had kept completely for shopping.I went to Le Mercerie.It is famous for street\
  \ shopping.I was really overehlemed by seeing the shops and boutiques of the largest\
  \ top Italian and international fashion. I bought many things for my family and\
  \ moved back to my hotel.\n   The last day had finally arrived.My journey was going\
  \ to conclude.That day I had planned to visit Murano.The island of Murano is renowned\
  \ for its long tradition of glass-making.I saw many glass souvenirs.The shops were\
  \ rich with handcrafted glass things.I bought many things for my friends and family.\n\
  \   That night I boarded the flight and within 13 hours  I was back home. That whole\
  \ day I slept due to jet lag. The next day I felt poles apart.I missed the water\
  \ taxi. I missed everything from that place.\n   The leap taken by me was worthwhile\
  \ and gave me so much to remember.When I came back I was much more confident and\
  \ happier.I learnt that sometimes to take risks and jump into something new can\
  \ be the most fruitful thing in your life.I also learnt to believe in myself."
