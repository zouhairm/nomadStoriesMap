Text: "Ferociously a flayed club of thews slammed onto the table by the burly arm\
  \ of the swarthy chasseur. In his other hand he brandished a horrendous knife and\
  \ gave me a leonine smile, broad in almond cheeks. \u2018I shot the beast myself,\u2019\
  \ he said as he began to carve blood-hued slices onto my plate, \u2018couple years\
  \ ago. I cure all the beasts for Ubraye, I am the best charcutier. Today we celebrate\
  \ Ubraye; she is our home, our chateau.\u2019\n\tAt noon I had descended Mont Bernarde\
  \ and when I thought I could smell again the thyme amongst the pine I had spotted\
  \ Ubraye. Her coddled pink pantiles were salient in the green verdure, sat on a\
  \ shoulder far in the valley low, belittled by mountainous escarpments beyond it.\
  \ As I had arrived and moved between its stone walls, the sultry air uncloaked from\
  \ around me and in that respite of cool I heard the clatter of laughter and the\
  \ trickle of a lavoir.\n\tI was late, they had giggled, as I unsubmerged my head\
  \ from slaking my thirst in the lavoir. For what, I had replied, squinting from\
  \ the sun and the wet hairs of my fringe. Late to lunch!\n\tThe lively bunch, probably\
  \ half of Ubraye, had been arrayed in the shady half of the place; around the tables\
  \ littered with debris of plates, glasses and bottles of wine. I was enthroned on\
  \ a old wooden chair, offered a cigarette and poured some glowing Limoncello with\
  \ ice.. and when I had seen to that, they poured me another. The cooking was retrieved\
  \ and spooned and dished; and that was when the chasseur had struck his thews of\
  \ boar.\n\t\u2018You walking these forests?\u2019 He eyebrowed, pointing his knife\
  \ whilst between a slice, \u2018Beware the sangliers, they are m\xE9chants, breed\
  \ like rabbits, murderous if you get between their little ones.\u2019 \n\tI nodded,\
  \ everyone laughed and lunch reposed through the afternoon. Some dozed off in stupors\
  \ of wine and sun; and underneath their chairs the chasseur lit a little firework,\
  \ which gave even those awake a fright.\n\tWith gifts of cured boar stowed away\
  \ in my rucksack, salty in smell and taste, darkly crimson, soft and smokey, it\
  \ was time to adieu Ubraye. Now Nice beckoned from over the mountains...\n\tThat\
  \ early evening I plunged back into the Haute Provence, taking tracks shelved into\
  \ the steeps of the cool alpine forests. A stone cracked beneath my foot and all\
  \ I heard was that, for a moment, then suddenly hooves scampered in the shadows,\
  \ little phantoms fleeting away from my sight as clumps of pine needles were thrown\
  \ into the air. Then ensued a silence as the drooping larches swayed. The chasseur\u2019\
  s warnings recalled to mind and I felt the fear and saw visions of Calydonian tusks\
  \ hurtling towards me.\n\tThe twilight after next I was on the suburban \u2018terraces\u2019\
  \ above Nice; its turbid air gloomed and lights blinked in the distant below. I\
  \ struggled to find a good spot to camp as the wilderness had disappeared, so I\
  \ settled on the terrace of a building site of a minimalist mansion.\n\tRemoving\
  \ my glasses, I slept. All night surpassed thirty degrees and the mosquitoes thought\
  \ it fun to force me into my sleeping bag, torturing me with heat and sweat. \n\t\
  In the middle of the night I awoke to a noise and immediately sat up. A mere two\
  \ metres in front of me, blurred in my shortsightedness, was a big black orb in\
  \ the darkness. The orb moved as if startled at my sudden rise, and then the most\
  \ blood curdling squeal clutched my heart through my ears. Shit! Boar! Shit! My\
  \ mind raced as my hand simultaneously blindly groped for my glasses. This boar,\
  \ my own Erymanthian Labour, hesitated for, what I could only imagine, my blood.\
  \ Without weapon or wise I instinctively went for my lungs and, I will lie and say,\
  \ let out a Herculean roar which stunned the beast, who squealing retreated and\
  \ into the darkness routed.\n\tMy heart thundered. I found those glasses, cursed\
  \ them, then thought whether to move. Decided against it, the standoff was won,\
  \ put my glasses down and curled into my boiling sleeping bag."
