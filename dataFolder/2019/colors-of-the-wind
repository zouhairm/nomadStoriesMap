Text: "I'm Antonella, Argentina/Italian and I always wanted to fly. The world seemed\
  \ enormous to me to stay in one place. I have been able to know Ecuador, Brazil,\
  \ Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, Bahamas, United States, Cuba, much of Argentina and many\
  \ cities in Europe, was in 2016 when I toured this continent with my friends and\
  \ felt the most magical vibe of my life to tread Barcelona, where today I live.\n\
  Everything I lived since I started this adventure, in July of 2018, were thanks\
  \ to that I lower the volume to the voice of my head and up to the maximum The voice\
  \ of my heart, of my soul and of my inner girl, giving me place to play , because\
  \ living is playing and I was looking for new ways to do it.\nI looked for oxygen\
  \ and found dreams that I always wanted to fulfill and that relate to art and expression.\
  \ I started to lead by the rhythm of the sky, asking for signs to the moon and the\
  \ sun, to the stars too. \nI started my trip in Pisa, where I thought I was going\
  \ to see the love of my life, that was actually a person with whom I connect a lot\
  \ in Argentina and \nhe incentive to realize my dream. Starting the trip with a\
  \ heartbreak was hard, but allowed me to be open to meet new people in all that\
  \ was coming (and I had no idea of everything I was going to live). From the earth\
  \ go to the water, I went to Venice, I lost in those streets full of history, I\
  \ needed fluency.\nFrom that heartbreak jump to the warm embrace of my two best\
  \ friends, with whom I travelled Greece and Croatia: sunbathe on a beach where the\
  \ sand is lava from a volcano, I saw the nearest sun in Zadar while the organ sounded\
  \ in the sea , I traveled the Plitvice lakes and I felt in Bariloche, I pulled a\
  \ high stone in Split and I saw the bottom of the blue sea full of stones grabbed\
  \ by the hand of my best friend, we arrived at Hvar and wanted the time to freeze\
  \ : The most magical island in which I was, with turquoise water and giant stones,\
  \ the laughter of my friends dancing in Hula Hula with strawberry Margarita, the\
  \ transparency of the water of Palmizana, the wall of Dubvronik and feel me in a\
  \ medieval story, reach Greece on a plane of propeller, go around Santorini by car,\
  \ fill the retina with blue watching from the lighthouse as the sky is camouflaged\
  \ with the sea, see the sunset in Oia with the largest sun and orange, listen live\
  \ the Chainsmokers with the sea in the background and to play the song of The Lion\
  \ King, the Acropolis of Athens and the pink granite floor, exit the subway in Rome\
  \ and see the Colosseum, tour the coast of Genoa on motorbike with Enrique , to\
  \ know Sori: The Castagnola village, the color of the windows of the houses of St.\
  \ Margaret, the boats in Portofino, the sangria in the street of the colourful umbrellas\
  \ of Genoa Principe, the Duomo in Milan, the Malaga fair with my cousins, the Paseo\
  \ de la Costa de Marbella , palms and the Mojito of 1litre in the Malagueta listening\
  \ to Donna summer, listen to Solomun in Pacha Ibiza and know the most beautiful\
  \ cove of the Mediterranean, the days in a grey Berlin with my cousins, get to Barcelona\
  \ and confirm because it is my city in the world : Everything is connected, vibrating\
  \ is that the wind changes.\nI learned to dance the dance of my dreams, being faithful\
  \ to myself, I dance to the rhythm of my heart, which moves fast, like a Colibri,\
  \ looking for adventures. If I could take a picture the minute my Colibri starts\
  \ flapping, that picture could be called magic.\nI launched to the adventure trusting\
  \ that nothing would fail, and today I thank what I fail because it made me grow,\
  \ and what flowed, because between them make me be who I am today. \nThere is fire,\
  \ earth, air and water, all connected."
