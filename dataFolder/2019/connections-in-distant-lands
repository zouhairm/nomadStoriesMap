Text: "Most people don't travel during the rainy session, its wet, its humid but for\
  \ me it tells the story of the country. There is something amazing about sheltering\
  \ from the rain with locals under the same roofs, of the cleanliness in the air\
  \ straight after the rain has fallen; of jumping over puddles like a small child\
  \ as the clouds clear and the rain clouds move on. Some of my best memories of Nepal\
  \ happen in the rain or straight after the rain. This was the second time I had\
  \ been in Kathmandu during the rainy session. To me the rain in Kathmandu now represents\
  \ opportunity to meet new people and experience new things. \n\nWhen I return I\
  \ can't help but visit my favourite places. I have traveled to Nepal a number of\
  \ times and every time I am in Kathmandu I make sure to visit the same temple area\
  \ its called Swayambhunath. The location is stunning, you walk up a hill in order\
  \ to get a fantastic view over the city and see the temple surrounded by colourful\
  \ prayer flags waving in the wind. The walk up is as rewarding as the top of the\
  \ mountain, as you walk there are monkey's everywhere! They are wandering around\
  \ in between the tourists, the shops, the dogs and the humans. They will stare at\
  \ you while you take their photographs blissfully unaware of the impact they are\
  \ making as people try and capture the moment.\n\nI am enamored by the monkeys that\
  \ live their, their co-existence with the dogs and the humans that live there and\
  \ the sunset over the city of Kathmandu \nbut this time was different. This time\
  \ we walked down the mountain after dark, we had stayed on top of the mountain as\
  \ the sun set over the city absorbing the images of the prayer flags, the temple\
  \ and the monkeys in the dusk. Myself and two friends started to walk down the mountain\
  \ in the dark, we saw a young girl and her family standing by a table of candles.\
  \ The candles all grouped together created a bright light that you felt compelled\
  \ to go closer and take a better look. You paid a small amount to light a candle\
  \ and make a wish but we were mesmerized by the firelight and the dancing candles\
  \ in the almost complete darkness. The little girl standing with her mother and\
  \ older sister bravely asked us where we were from; we responded and spoke to her\
  \ in the little Nepalese that we had learnt on our journey. My friend took photos\
  \ of the lights in the darkness and we sat with this girl and her family and they\
  \ told us stories of their life while we lit candles. We traded stories not as tourist\
  \ to local, not as seller to buyer. not as a transaction but as an exchange of knowledge.\
  \ We thought about the past, the present and the future as we all stood around the\
  \ firelight. In the darkness of the mountain, of the temple and with all the animals\
  \ watching we stumbled and communicated across two languages finding common ground\
  \ and communication between us but in the end we didn't need words in the end we\
  \ sat in silence watching the dancing fire in the shadow of the mountain being watched\
  \ by the monkeys as they headed into the shadows for another night."
