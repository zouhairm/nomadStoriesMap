Text: "I was on my way to Cologne, Germany via rail. The leg from Frankfurt traced\
  \ the majestic Rhine River. I enjoyed watching the low barges nudge along the seemingly\
  \ still water, framed by colourful architecture and vines that seem to grow perilously\
  \ on seventy-degree slopes hugging the river. I was enjoying a breather after a\
  \ gruelling seven-week tour of Norway. After dropping show gear off in storage in\
  \ Frankfurt I was meeting my partner Natalia in Cologne, because it was conveniently\
  \ placed between our next location in Belgium and I\u2019d heard about its beautiful\
  \ gothic architecture, local K\xF6lsh beer and quaint streets full of boutiques\
  \ selling various aromas.\n\nAs you get out of the train station in Cologne you\
  \ are immediately struck by the most astonishing Gothic cathedral, The K\xF6lner\
  \ Dom. Knowing the history of Germany in the past 70 years, the fact that a cathedral\
  \ of this size still stands is a remarkable feat. I got a simple hotel room for\
  \ the night, which seemed to set itself apart from the others with its abundance\
  \ of oranges in the lobby. Hundreds. \n\nAlter Markt (Old Town) is the place to\
  \ go in Cologne with its windy cobblestone streets, small bars and market stalls\
  \ nestled amongst its Romanesque churches. The local football team had won and people\
  \ were out in numbers. I saw a man in a clown costume and a group of men dressed\
  \ in Beatles suits singing Hey Jude to the drunken crowd. I didn\u2019t think much\
  \ of it, just that this was a particularly boisterous night out in Cologne.\n\n\
  In the morning, I arranged to meet Natalia outside the main train station, just\
  \ near the Body Shop I said, should be easy to find each other. As I was heading\
  \ there enjoying a pleasant, quiet, sunny morning, I passed Jack Sparrow\u2026 Super\
  \ Mario\u2026 and Pikachu. I figured there must have been some sort of fancy dress\
  \ party nearby and shrugged it off. But as I turned the corner to head across the\
  \ square, I suddenly saw at least\u2026 eight thousand people, all in fancy dress.\
  \ Meeting each other wasn\u2019t going to be as easy as I thought\u2026\n\nThankfully\
  \ the advent of location sharing meant we could track each other down, I found her\
  \ next to a couple of sexy nurses and Dracula.  It turns out the one day we had\
  \ come to Cologne also happened to correspond with the opening of the carnival season.\
  \ On the 11th of November at 11.11am the K\xF6lner Karneval starts. It is often\
  \ stated that festival season in Cologne is nicknamed the Fifth Season and is only\
  \ interrupted over the next few months by a small thing called Christmas and some\
  \ intermittent fasting. This particular day, it turns out, is about when the peasants\
  \ got given the keys to the city in the 1820\u2019s. This now is celebrated by respecting\
  \ the peasant\u2019s great love of techno, onesies and currywurst.\n\nI thought\
  \ the carnival might have just been centred in this square and we\u2019d have a\
  \ chance to get a meal in the Old Town, but the crowd swallowed us up and took us\
  \ into its bowels, I\u2019d never seen a festival take over every nook and cranny\
  \ of a city, bars packed with witches, alleyways full of pirates. We weaved our\
  \ way through the crowds, to the soundtrack of thumping music, dodging the open-air\
  \ urinals and a passed out Cinderella. Spat out the other side we managed to procure\
  \ some sweet relief at the Cologne Chocolate Museum. Armed with supplies, we had\
  \ a dance with some ninja turtles and eventually found a place to sit down and have\
  \ a meal. We were seated next to a friendly American and Turkish pair, who, were\
  \ equally baffled by the cavalcade of characters and especially the amorous display\
  \ of Sailor Moon and Batman outside our window.\n\nKnown as the birthplace of perfume,\
  \ today Cologne smelt more like stale beer and sweat from the inside of a polyester\
  \ costume. We decided that 8 hours of blasting techno and packed streets was enough,\
  \ and headed for the train to Bruges. We agreed to come back to Cologne another\
  \ day and next time, we\u2019ll bring our onesies."
