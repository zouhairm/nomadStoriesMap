Text: "I'm the one who travel every day with her imagination.\nI'm the one who try\
  \ everyday to catch up some memories from the back of the life.  \nI'm the one who\
  \ found an amazing oppurtunity to live a different life and, i'm the one who took\
  \ a plane to New York without no one, without friends or family, just with two suitcases\
  \ and a body full off expectations and emotions. \nI saw New York for the first\
  \ time and i can swear that i saw the \"real me\" for the very first time.\nI mean...\
  \ We always have in our mind many things about ourself, we think that we know us\
  \ but it's not so, we can discover who we are just when we are in front of an experience\
  \ or in front of something that scare us. \nI was alone but i understood that our\
  \ heart is really big and it can have everyone inside. \nI was thinking that i wanted\
  \ to found who i were, i did. \nI found me, i found my way to be happy. \nWe feed\
  \ on expectations, the reality is that sometimes we just have to get carried away\
  \ by instinct without too many questions, without organizing our heart and mind.\n\
  Just starting, just giving yourself an opportunity\nA travel maked me understand\
  \ that the earth is our place, that the people are just person that can prove my\
  \ same feelings and i understood that the heart of my wolrd is not a place, but\
  \ persons. \nI cannot be alone, never...\nBecause i can always find my safe point,\
  \ the heart of my world, my breath, my everything... In my Family, the costant of\
  \ my life!. \nLet the travel bring you around your internal world, let the travel\
  \ help you to understand what do you want from yourself!."
