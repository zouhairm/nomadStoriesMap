Text: "Conservation is not my job, it's my lifestyle.\n\nIt\xB4s with this phrase\
  \ that I\xB4m received by my new colleague, at Campo Grande airport, capital of\
  \ Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.\n\nAnd for the next 35 days I'd understand the weight\
  \ of those words in my own life.\n\nI was on my way to a new job at an NGO that\
  \ works for the conservation of the jaguar in the Pantanal Sul Matogrossense. Located\
  \ in a rural area and totally isolated - the nearest town is at least an hour by\
  \ car, if weather conditions are good - my routine would be to work every day in\
  \ the office administration and also in training in the field. It would be to live\
  \ with strangers who were in the same situation as me, and to welcome the guests\
  \ who came from afar to do ecotourism.\n\nAs I had never been to the Pantanal, nor\
  \ personally known the Ecological Reserve I would live in, everything was new and\
  \ unknown. I was excited to be in a place that I wanted to visit since I was a child.\n\
  \nI knew that the place was a very old farm, colonized by Englishmen. Now, it was\
  \ in the hands of an important Brazilian businessman who, in addition to ecotourism,\
  \ had been raising livestock there for decades.\n\nLiving and working with all the\
  \ employess every day, I was able to go beyond my expectations. I could experience\
  \ how it was to work in tourism, in a place so inhospitable, wild and lonely. \n\
  \nIn this incredible biome of flora and fauna, there is also a huge diversity of\
  \ people. Natives have been accustomed to seeing wild animals in the backyard of\
  \ their houses since they were babies, and sometimes kept them as pets.\n\nMen and\
  \ women who came from generations of jaguar hunters; but for a good job opportunity\
  \ and a change of their minds, now lived side by side with these big cats, and raised\
  \ their family working for the conservation of nature.\n\nOthers came from various\
  \ corners of Brazil, mostly biologists. Newly graduated students, young people who\
  \ dream of doing different, dream of leaving their legacy in this world.\n\nThe\
  \ ecological reserve provided us with everything: from nature came the incredible\
  \ sunrises and sunsets, rainbows, armadillos, tapirs, white-lipped peccaries, blue\
  \ macaws, capybaras, anteaters, jaguars chilling on the village soccer field, and\
  \ many others. One of the things that astonished me most, was to see the blue-fronted\
  \ Amazon parrots flying free and vocalizing in their own voice, not caged, doomed\
  \ to imitate the voice of a human being.\n\nFrom the dining room came the wonderful\
  \ food, half organic, half industrialized, but always made with much affection and\
  \ dedication of the cooks.\n\nThose who are going for a tour have no idea of the\
  \ sacrifices these workers make every day (the bad part of being there).\n\nBeing\
  \ away from family, not being able to keep a close eye on the growth of your children.\
  \ From living in a constant \u201CBig Brother\u201D, to make all meals surrounded\
  \ by people from work, so you\xB4re always working.\n\nThe lack of privacy and freedom,\
  \ to come and go any time you want. From the hard adaptation, from the exhaustive\
  \ hours of work, which\xB4s start very early on the farm. From the fear of getting\
  \ hurt, and being three hours away from good medical care.\n\nThe obligation to\
  \ always look cheerful and motivated in front of the guests on the safaris.\n\n\
  Despite all this, I\xB4ll never forget the \u201Cterer\xE9s\u201D (the cold version\
  \ of Argentinian mate) shared with co-workers. Of the laughter and the new connections\
  \ made. To share 20 hours of tour bus only with Bolivians, to visit incredible waterfalls,\
  \ to live the colors and unique flavors of the Pantanal. From being incredibly surprised\
  \ by scorpions in my room, or receiving a \u201Chave a very nice day\u201D from\
  \ a cow from my window.\n\nThis wild paradise that is home not only to wild animals,\
  \ but also to many human beings, taught me a lot about the beliefs, dreams and history\
  \ of my own people."
