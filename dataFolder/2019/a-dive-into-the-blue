Text: "Swimmers, take your mark. I\u2019m standing on the starting block. Upright,\
  \ nervous, eager. I untie my legs and arms, shrugging my shoulders while my head\
  \ draws a circle clockwise. All around, the chaos. Top-down, I glimpse opposite\
  \ teams cheering, yelling, waving. I don\u2019t recognize sounds nor faces. I feel\
  \ catapulted in a foreign, parallel dimension. Brentwood, Tennessee. State qualifying\
  \ swim race, women, 100 meters breaststroke. Everything appears to be evolving.\
  \ Everything, except for the scoreboard, which marks zero in all its measures. Empty,\
  \ origin, new beginning. It\u2019s like before leaving for a journey, a bit bare,\
  \ a bit airtight. You know what you leave, not what you\u2019ll find. Excited and\
  \ melancholic. The world seems as weary as the cheering sections seen through the\
  \ goggles. Cream-colored like the floor, wetter and wetter as it approaches the\
  \ pool-side. Like the weather outside in a tedious mid-February afternoon. Swimmers\
  \ ready to dive. Tense eyes, determination, a speed round, the desire to arrive\
  \ that tenth of a second before the last time, that tenth of a second after the\
  \ next one. 1:26.39, the time not to exceed. 1:26.39 in which it doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ if I\u2019m half way across the world, with my family eight thousand kilometres\
  \ away, different continents, a ten-hour flight. It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019\
  m sixteen and don\u2019t always understand my coach\u2019s indications. Christine,\
  \ Chris who calls me \u201CJewel\u201D, instead of \u201CJules\u201D. Chris, who\
  \ draws my attention and instructs me \u2013 a nod to remind me not to get distracted,\
  \ eyes fixed, stay focused. Better not to fear a jump.  \nSet. I make sure my goggles\
  \ are tight and my cap is firmly attached to my forehead. The right thumb escapes\
  \ the trampoline a few centimetres, ready to push the left foot, the weak one, when\
  \ diving. My lane is next to the middle one \u2013 a benefit, since waves penalize\
  \ me less. I\u2019m an exchange student, here thanks to a ten-month scholarship.\
  \ I stare at the water and time seems never-ending. I hear shouting from the bench.\
  \ Those strangers are now my anchor, screaming \u201Cgo Jewel\u201D show tunes.\
  \ \u201CGiulia\u201D is a test for Americans, full of vowels and diphthongs. My\
  \ body is still dry and apathetic, almost naked but amenable to any new, unexpected\
  \ feeling. When you have nothing, you have nothing to lose. My coach\u2019s words\
  \ thump into my head. \u201CIf you are there, be all there\u201D. She\u2019s a beautiful\
  \ woman. Blonde, with a brown eye and a blue one. Every time before a competition\
  \ she takes my hands and whispers a prayer, unconcerned about the fact that she\u2019\
  s a devout Christian and I\u2019m not even baptized. I no longer see people yelling,\
  \ grey floors and nervous swimmers. I only see the block and my toes. Exactly like\
  \ in a journey, where the more time passes, the more life takes shape. Stronger\
  \ and less fearful. Up for the challenge, because the view is no longer filtered\
  \ by the googles but it is, suddenly, sharp as never before.    \nGo. The water\
  \ is crystal clear. Still, host country and not guest. It never demands, but it\
  \ takes and it gives. Swimmers ready to dive. When nobody knows you, you can be\
  \ the best version of yourself. On the starting block I\u2019m the best version\
  \ of myself. With no origin nor destination. As transparent as the water. Wearing\
  \ my swimsuit, deep inside undressed. With no hesitation, I pivot the right toe\
  \ while raising the left heel, trying not to push up, but rather long. Head between\
  \ my armpits, hands crossing one another, the body of a mermaid. This is not a leap\
  \ into the unknown. Every leap scares, but if you jump, you are willing to take\
  \ the risk. 1:26.39 doesn\u2019t scare me. It doesn\u2019t matter if you lose speed\
  \ underwater or you stall in the turn. You can still repay. Whether with the stroke\
  \ or with the kick. Only, you need to be all there. Because every journey starts\
  \ with a dive. And this is not a leap into the darkness. This is a leap into the\
  \ blue. And leaps into the blue don\u2019t scare. Now dive."
