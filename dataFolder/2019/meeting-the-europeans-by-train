Text: "Meeting the Europeans by train\n\nThe story that I want to will tell you could\
  \ fill into the three categories. First, it was a big leap into the unknown: my\
  \ first travel alone, across 9 European countries from Paris to Athens. But for\
  \ once, I don\u2019t want to write about myself, I want to write about the incredible\
  \ people I met during my trip and share with you their story.\n\_\nFirst, let\u2019\
  s go back to me for a second. My name is Amaury, I\u2019m a 23 years old French\
  \ guy and for my last summer as a student, I wanted to do something special. So\
  \ I took a summer job and saved a little extra money for travelling. I couldn\u2019\
  t afford an all-inclusive trip to Miami (and there is nothing special in it anyway),\
  \ while Europe held out my arms. I decided to travel alone for the first time to\
  \ finally push myself out of my comfort zone and meet new people.\_\n9 very friendly\
  \ persons that I consider now as my friend, opened me their house and their couch\
  \ for a few nights. During the time we spent together, we shared food, stories and\
  \ laughs and I was able to know them better than anybody else. Each city I made,\
  \ each people I met were an amazing experience on its own and today I want you to\
  \ meet 3 of them.\n\_\n\n\nFirst of all, there is Hisyam. When I met Hisyam in Budapest,\
  \ I had already made more than 2000 km by train and travelled 5 countries, so I\
  \ was already used to Couchsurfing and live to strangers' place. But Hisyam was\
  \ my age, 23 and he was a really nice host with me. He was born and raised in Malaysia,\
  \ but very early he expressed the wish to leave his country and move abroad to live\
  \ his youth. That\u2019s what he did. \xAB In Malaysia you cannot drink alcohol\
  \ or have a piercing \xBB he said, showing me proudly his pierced ears. Firstly,\
  \ he moved one year in Northern Italy to study informatics and then Hungary to find\
  \ a job. Hisyam is a European lover, but as he said to me, it\u2019s hard for him\
  \ here, under the Orban\u2019s administration. The anti-migrant policy prevents\
  \ him to find a job and soon he will have to move again if nobody gives him his\
  \ chance.\n\nWho can give him a chance, who can really make a difference if not\
  \ a lawmaker? Stanislav is a former deputy of Slovakia from 2010 to 2012 and he\
  \ accepted to host me the night France won the World Cup. He is known in his country\
  \ to be the first deputy openly gay in the National Council. He came out in 2011\
  \ and since he is really involved in the protection of LGBTI rights. As a member\
  \ of the Freedom and Solidarity committee in the Council of Europe, he\u2019s also\
  \ very concerned about the death of a young anti-corruption journalist last year.\
  \ The protestations in which he participated, led to the resignation of the president.\
  \ Since 2008, four journalists were murdered because of their work, here in the\
  \ European Union.\n\nNo need to be a politician or a journalist to make a difference.\
  \ Cosmin was my host in Romania, he is a lawyer who decided to dedicate his life\
  \ and his job to protect the environment. He works with Greenpeace and other local\
  \ NGOs to sue every company which doesn\u2019t respect the environmental law in\
  \ Romania. The country has so many coal mines, and to shot down one is a case of\
  \ David and Goliath, but step by step he could really changes the world.\n\n\n\n\
  Even if the people I met weren\u2019t representative of the European citizens, it\
  \ was so rewarding to talk with them. I visited 9 European countries, made exactly\
  \ 3762 km by train, walked more than 500km by foot and became friend with 9 wonderful\
  \ people. What an adventure!\_\n\nI promised you in the beginning, that my story\
  \ could have filled into the three categories. I could have written about the last\
  \ thing I expected to find on my road: love. But that is another story.\n\n\nAmaury\
  \ BISIAUX"
