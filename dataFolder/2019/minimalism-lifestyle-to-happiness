Text: 'Last year (2017) took me on ventures I never expected to experience at the
  start of the year. Life revolved and I was forced to live in the present. This lead
  me to putting all my personal belonging into storage and set off into the unknown.
  I had no idea where my ''life'' path would take me and so all I could do is live
  in the moment. At this point I didn''t realise all the amazing people I was going
  to meet, the breath taking views I was going to see or the magical moments I was
  going to experience.



  Amongst the fear of the unkown (not knowing when I was going to return to England),
  I started to feel liberated and a feeling of freedom filled my soul. So I embraced
  the change and traveled to Portugal (where I heard it was good for yoga and surfing).



  As soon as I arrived in Portugal I was greeted with like-minded beautiful souls
  from all around the world. I feel very grateful that I was in the same place at
  the same time as such wonderful people (some of them are now my life long friends).
  All the people I met taught me something, I felt my personal growth expand by their
  knowledge, wisdom and stories. But most of all I enjoyed the moments spent with
  them and the adventures we went on, just being in their presents was a blessing.


  "They say embrace change so I did"'
