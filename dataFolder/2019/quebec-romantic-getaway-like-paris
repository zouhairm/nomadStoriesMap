Text: "When I thought no of a place to visit that is romantic and historically significant\
  \ I think Paris or European countries. I was thinking of a romantic place to take\
  \ my husband who was turning 50 years old to a world of antiquity without the price\
  \ of flying to Europe. \n    Two of my friends encouraged me to feel the romantic\
  \ exuberance of Montreal. In fact a coworker insists I go and visit Montreal and\
  \ then Quebec. Quebec is the most romantic antiquated city of Canada. With the notion\
  \ of romance and French cuisine and amazing Gothic architecture to view it was all\
  \ I could dream. Visiting this city was the best option of since it\u2019s cost\
  \ effective, romantic, great Canadian French cuisine and with French architecture\
  \ with historical significance.  \n       We set our romantic journey to Montreal\
  \ to wine and dine on French cuisine. We remained content looking at the Canadian\
  \ version of Notre Dame building and the beautiful port with the large Ferris wheel.\
  \ This mostly urban city had incredible charm with its universities and amazing\
  \ French cuisine and Gothic architecture. \n     My husband was enchanted but wanted\
  \ to enrich his experience by venturing to Quebec. The hotel we had was behind the\
  \ most castle like building the Fairmont Chateau  Frontenauc Hotel the most romantic\
  \ hotel at the base of the coast of the Lawrence river. The most enchanting part\
  \ of the Chateau is it\u2019s location along river and the Governor Promenade the\
  \ mountain that led to the city\u2019s citadel was an amazing place to climb to\
  \ get the best burd\u2019s view of the city. A series of steps that escalate up\
  \ a mountain that reaches to the highest part of the hill. We climbed the hill to\
  \ the citadel where the first navel base was built in 1600\u2019s. A monumental\
  \ navel fortress that was erected to defend themselves from the English who were\
  \ constantly battling the French. It was the the French who built the citadel with\
  \ cannons and still  remained as one of the most significantly historical landmarks\
  \ for Quebec. The climb left you as breathless as the view. Looking down from the\
  \ top of the Governor\u2019s Promenade made everything look like miniatures and\
  \ the whole city can be viewed from this place.\n      The next day we embarked\
  \ on going to the citadel to look at the cannons and learn some history of the ongoing\
  \ battle between the French and English. The battle that left the fur industry in\
  \ dire because the English battle fleet defeated the French. Though the city remains\
  \ French in riots with cuisine, architecture and of course the official language.\
  \ The most fantastic thing about the Citadel was it\u2019s invilvement in WWI and\
  \ WWII and the bomb shelters on the premise. The national emblem of the fort was\
  \ a beaver and the French flag which still held on to the French roots since Cartier\
  \ the explorer. The exhibit of the citadel had many uniforms and letters that were\
  \ framed that the officers wrote to their loved ones. I was deeply moved by the\
  \ sentiment of the hero\u2019s that had fallen and conquered their fears through\
  \ letters to their beloved family. \n    The best part of Quebec for me was the\
  \ quaint feel of the small city where the streets were all cobblestone and houses\
  \ were small and French looking. At night their were gaslight lamps looming a beautiful\
  \ glow that light up the roads which were festooned with Halloween decorations from\
  \ a pumpkin patch to the mini haunted houses in the park. The moon that night was\
  \ full and the stores were Ll close and quiet. Some people would think think think\
  \ it was a sleepy city but I found it quiet and enchanting. I remained absolutely\
  \ fixated on the Fairmont Chateau Frontenauc which lit up in all shades of blue\
  \ and purple and discus pink light at night. Waking with a full moon cascading in\
  \ the moonlight kept me thinking that this is a city I would love to live in for\
  \ a month and write a vampire book filled with sex, love and romance. Lovely and\
  \ enchanting is Quebec City full of mystery , beauty and romance. We kissed each\
  \ other in the moonlightfor hours."
