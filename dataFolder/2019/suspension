Text: "The airport in Addis Ababa smelled of perfume, incense, and sweat. The duty-free\
  \ shops overcompensated for the scent of musty old clothes by drenching the already\
  \ thick air with Dior and Marc Jacobs, causing the smaller vendors with traditional\
  \ wares to light more bakhoor and agarwood that filled their shops with a density\
  \ that hit the back of her throat. Travellers rummaged through baskets containing\
  \ Coptic crosses made from old coins, their elaborate latticework drawing from Celtic\
  \ and Egyptian influences that represented one of the oldest forms of Christianity\
  \ in Africa. Other commuters prayed in tiny rooms with musallahs already laid out\
  \ facing Mecca, their travel clothes hastily covered by abayas and kurtas between\
  \ flights. \n\nSome hovered around the smoking room, which was little more than\
  \ an old converted kitchen with feeble extractor fans barely removing the stench\
  \ that wafted out every time someone opened the door. The restaurants were full\
  \ of people wanting to get a quick meal in before braving the airline food, and\
  \ some fell asleep at the boarding gate waiting areas while some read their books\
  \ or stared at their phones. Through all of it, quietly watched people living their\
  \ transient lives in the most structured way they could; a hurried attempt at normalcy\
  \ in the awkward suspension of waiting.\nShe loved watching people at airports.\
  \ Travel is always filled with anticipation. Whether they were going home or leaving\
  \ home, there was a sense of eagerness. The coming or going is not always happy.\
  \ People waited to go home for funerals or to see a loved one in pain, and some\
  \ waited to go to a place they\u2019ve never been and were filled with worry. Women\
  \ travelling alone looked about in a lulled fear, hoping everything will be fine.\
  \ \n\nThe carpets at boarding gates littered with shoes and bags filled the air\
  \ with urgent longing. Some slept the wait away. Others read, sometimes looking\
  \ around to ensure their things were safe. Some looked out the window and probably\
  \ wondered whether they had forgotten something. Some spoke to their travel partners\
  \ and some had their eyes glued to their phones or took selfies. Soft and not-so-soft\
  \ snoring was interspersed with languages she didn't recognise and some she did.\
  \ She eavesdropped on conversations in English and French; the two she knew fluently.\
  \ She giggled to herself when they said something funny so as to not seem rude.\n\
  \nThe fluorescent light giving little space to be inconspicuous. These transitional\
  \ spaces are a window to the best and worst parts of humanity. How people loved\
  \ and how they got angry with delays and airport staff. The waiting is a suspension\
  \ of life; a small breather from life in one city to life in the next."
