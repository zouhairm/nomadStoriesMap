Text: "1. We don\u2019t like Salsa\u2026we LOVE it! To say Cubans love their music\
  \ and dance is a massive understatement. I have never experienced a culture where\
  \ music is so entrenched in every facet of life. Every Cuban appears to have some\
  \ innate ability to sing, dance and play a musical instrument, or all three, and\
  \ sometimes at the same time! You can\u2019t walk 10 meters in Havana without your\
  \ visual or auditory senses being stimulated. There\u2019s always music, EVERYWHERE!\
  \  I happened to be there during the tragic plane accident that claimed 100 lives,\
  \ and the government declared a period of national mourning. For 3 days, there was\
  \ no live music or dancing in Havana. It felt like the city lost its soul. Then\
  \ on the evening of the 3rd day, I heard the wonderful sound of congas break the\
  \ musical \"fast\", and Havana felt awakened and whole again.\n\n2. The best thing\
  \ about Cuba is the Cubans. The only way to do Cuba is to stay at family owned and\
  \ run Casa Particulares. I stayed with a lovely young family, renting their spare\
  \ bedroom, living and discovering the city like a local. Every morning during breakfast,\
  \ we would chat about life in Australia. They are surprisingly open about their\
  \ views the on the pros and cons of living in Cuba. They taught me how to use the\
  \ local buses and \u201Ccollectivos\u201D taxi system to get to my daily piano lessons.\
  \ Living and traveling this way really does give you an authentic taste of how the\
  \ locals live. I had many interesting encounters with locals. When they didn\u2019\
  t mistake me for one of their tribe, they were always curious about Australia, about\
  \ India, why I was there, what music I played and my hair! I was in awe of their\
  \ vitality, energy and optimism, despite their very obvious daily struggles with\
  \ poverty and food rations. Yes there were times I was a little bit on edge as I\
  \ was carrying more cash on this trip than I usually do (ATMs can be dodgy) but\
  \ I never once felt unsafe or threatened in Havana despite walking through some\
  \ pretty dark dusty streets returning from salsa clubs at 3am!\n\n3. Its kinda like\
  \ India. In a way Havana reminds me of Mumbai. It has some parts that are really\
  \ dirty, and other parts that are really beautiful. The Malecon is like Marine Drive,\
  \ along the ocean where all the locals come out to get away from the hustle and\
  \ bustle, to chill. There is definitely a lot of poverty in Cuba, and some areas\
  \ in Havana which would classify as \u201Cslums\u201D. And like India, while nothing\
  \ seems to work, it all comes together in the end. I am under no illusions that\
  \ Cuba is a tough place to live. Despite the free health, education and subsidised\
  \ food, the average Cuban can really struggle to live, and hustles like hell to\
  \ stay afloat. But they make it work. I am sure the music, the dance, their spirituality\
  \ helps, and a bit of rum.\n\n4. Rice and beans OR beans and rice! That\u2019s what\
  \ I was told would be my only options for food, especially as a vegetarian. But\
  \ I was really surprised, Cuban food isn\u2019t half as bad as I expected it to\
  \ be. And there was a pretty decent selection of vegetarian dishes to choose from,\
  \ including pastas, veg paellas, fried plantains and I even found a vegan burger.\
  \ Oh and of course there\u2019s rice and beans!\n\n5. Would you like some rum\u2026\
  with your rum? I now realise that the only way to serve a pina colada or mojito\
  \ is with rum on the side. When the bar tender prepares your cocktail, they leave\
  \ the bottle of rum on the table for you to free pour to your hearts content. Its\
  \ actually not as easy as it seems. I ruined many cocktails by overestimating my\
  \ tolerance for Havana Club and ended up drinking the cocktail through gritted teeth\
  \ as the rum piped through my veins in dangerous portions.\n\nNeedles to say it\
  \ is an amazing place. And Havana is now one of my favourite cities!"
