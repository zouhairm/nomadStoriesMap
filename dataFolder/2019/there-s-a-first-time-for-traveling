Text: "I am an aspiring food and travel blogger, that hasn\u2019t had the chance to\
  \ travel like I would like, due to lack of funds and time. However, my time is freeing\
  \ up soon and it would be a complete honor to be able to tell my story by my first\
  \ love: food. \nObviously everyone loves or needs food due to it being a necessity\
  \ to live, however my love goes beyond that. I have a passion that cannot be expressed\
  \ in words, you hear it with your ears, and see it with your eyes. My passion runs\
  \ deeper than just posting a burger on Instagram hoping for an adequate amount of\
  \ likes. I believe good food brings people together. Everyone\u2019s tastebuds are\
  \ different yet smiles and conversation spark from eating your favorite meal or\
  \ eating something for the very first time. \nI want to make an impact on food and\
  \ the importance it has on our everyday lives. Things like the amount of waste there\
  \ is in the food industry: whether it is from a restaurant, a catered event, or\
  \ something simple like product waste at home. We\u2019re oblivious and we take\
  \ food for granted. \nI was raised in a household where you ate everything in your\
  \ plate, whether you furnished it in one sitting or you came back to it later once\
  \ you grew hungry again. \nI would love to see how different cultures handle food\
  \ waste, and enlighten people all over the world."
