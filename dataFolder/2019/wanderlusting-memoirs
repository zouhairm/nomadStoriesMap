Text: "This is a vignette of my three days\u2019 life in the Himalayas \nThe mountains\
  \ spoke to me. Well, they speak to everyone, but who has the ears? She was majestic,\
  \ intimidating, beautiful, dangerous, enrapturing composition of nature\u2019s melody.\
  \ A vibe you can\u2019t help but tune into. The topiary scent wafting from the pine\
  \ trees nourished the psyche and soma with every zephyr. The blanched rivulet whisking\
  \ away in a serpent like dance enraptured me, rooting me to the spot. The mise en\
  \ scene was not foreign, having seen the similar settings on the television. But\
  \ the real deal was overwhelming. Never have I ever felt such pure pleasure, where\
  \ every breath was excitable, every motor response awed, and every sense titillating.\
  \ This tactility with Dame Nature was unanticipated, yet contenting. Experiencing\
  \ another level of alleviation altogether. The Italians have a word, attraversiamo:\
  \ to \u2018cross over\u2019. So did I, upsurge into an exotic phantasm in the lap\
  \ of serendipity, contended to choose this scenic \u2019hamlet\u2019 in the Tirthan\
  \ Valley of Himachal Pradesh, in a place called Jibhi.\nJibhi is a place where you\
  \ have to arrive. It is as it were one is seeking the \u2018holy grail\u2019, only\
  \ easier and infused with some breath taking views and mesmerising shores meet for\
  \ some interesting soul searching along the way. It can be approached from the Chandigarh-Manali\
  \ highway, and, after reaching a small town named \u2018Aut\u2019, one can traverse\
  \ on the road along the breath taking river \u2018Beas\u2019 to a lush green place\
  \ called \u2018Banjar\u2019, where one can take pit stops along the eateries along\
  \ the way in this town with alpine meadows and Victorian pinewood cottages, moving\
  \ further up to Jibhi towards \u2018Jhalori Pass\u2019, covering a distance of 35\
  \ kilometres. The drive is very scenic, with the serpentine flowing, is one of the\
  \ best parts of the journey.\nEverywhere I looked, I found a picturesque backdrop,\
  \ verdant lined, and snow topped views of the great Indian Himalayas. There was\
  \ so much, and I wanted to take in as much as I could of these ancient structures,\
  \ beautiful trails full of cedar trees, apple plantations, and soul soothing waterfalls.\
  \ As an adventure enthusiast, I set on a trek trail to the serene location of Sarehul\
  \ Lake, (via Jhalori Pass and Kanhi Jhalori 360 view peak) which was frozen in the\
  \ December air. On our way, we footslogged through dense patches of Himalayan oak\
  \ trees, and a few temples on the grassland vales, where the locals blessed our\
  \ troop with jiggery offerings and warm smiles. \nContrary to the city life, I spent\
  \ a lot of time outdoors; trekking, trailing, meditating by the water fall, lying\
  \ on the snow, and reading in the meadows. All this soul nourishing activities not\
  \ only distressed me, but also humbled me, and left me brimming with hope, even\
  \ in the eerie bleak hours and biting frost of the mountains. I was thoroughly charmed\
  \ by the splendour of nature in this short slice of mountain life escapade, feeling\
  \ serendipity through my bones while traversing through the small \u2018Pahadi\u2019\
  \ villages, with its various shrines, stone alignments and mossy oaks along the\
  \ way.\nTo get in touch with oneself, one has to get out from mundane settings of\
  \ monotony. There were many moments of philosophical self-awareness while I sat\
  \ in silence by the rocky and snow covered out crop of Seroyul Lake with a temple\
  \ on its shore, feeling enveloped by the amity of nature, making a memory that will\
  \ last forever. The experience of touching snow, feeling the elatedness emanate\
  \ from within when laying on the white clad microscopic geometrics, breathing the\
  \ crisp air, while enjoying a humbling meal of lentils and rice, prepared over firewood.\
  \ \nI am happy I took this less travelled road, that has filled me with so much\
  \ tranquillity. Everything was therapy, the gushing waterfalls, creeks, the walks\
  \ through the enchanted forests, smelling oak trees and wild flowers, living in\
  \ a non-commercialized accommodation of a homely guest house, the honest people\
  \ of the vale, bike rides in the blistering cold, getting lost in the mountains\
  \ (sometimes purposely). All this has brought me immense happiness, made me a better\
  \ person and a nouveau, but an ardent travel enthusiast."
