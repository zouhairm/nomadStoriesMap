Text: "The experiences and memories we live through everyday teach us many things.\
  \ Life is the best teacher. Many times we only see the surface, we never dig deep\
  \ inside to see the whole meaning of the situation. No one ever expects their parent\
  \ to die before they do.  As a girl you imagine your dad being by your side during\
  \ your college graduation, walking you down the aisle on your wedding day, being\
  \ called grandpa by your kids.  But all this is now unreachable for myself and many\
  \ others who have lost their loved ones; due to the violence in Mexico.  \n\nI have\
  \ lived in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico my whole life and followed the same routine of\
  \ crossing the border daily to receive an education in an all girls academy in El\
  \ Paso, TX.  In high school I was involved in many clubs and was part of the tennis\
  \ team.  I love living in the border of two countries because I get to see the difference\
  \ in the two cultures while learning both languages. I am fluent in both English\
  \ and Spanish. My life had been pretty normal until I turned 15 years old and faced\
  \ my parents divorced.  It was very hard for me to face the fact that my parents\
  \ would not be together anymore. I felt like my whole world was falling apart. With\
  \ time I was able to face all the hardships my parent\u2019s divorce brought. I\
  \ got used to this new life and continued living as a normal teenager. I graduated\
  \ high school and started attending the University of Texas at El Paso to obtain\
  \ my bachelors degree. I thought my parent\u2019s divorce was the hardest thing\
  \ that happened to me ever until my father\u2019s death. This summer he was assassinated\
  \ in my hometown.  The violence had started growing again and sadly he was one of\
  \ the victims of these terrible events. I had always been a \u201Cdaddy\u2019s girl\u201D\
  \ he was my best friend, he knew me better than I knew myself. When I found out\
  \ that he was gone forever, that was the hardest moment of my life. I would never\
  \ be able to talk to him again. Not even a simple hug. I felt lost for days; I didn\u2019\
  t know what to do with my life. I realized who my real friends were and that life\
  \ ends in a blink of an eye.  After this tragic event I decided to take a semester\
  \ off and volunteer abroad. I love the feeling of selflessness you get when you\
  \ volunteer. How something so simple can mean so much to others.  I am currently\
  \ in Madrid volunteering with in the agriculture field with a couple of immigrants\
  \ from Africa. I am living a whole different life than what I was used to.  It is\
  \ crazy to think that something so tragic gave my life a 180-degree spin.  After\
  \ my time in Madrid I will continue volunteering but in Peru. Here I will be working\
  \ with the conservation of animals. Life teaches you the toughest lessons right\
  \ when you think you are the strongest. But I believe it is good to fall, get up,\
  \ clean yourself up and continue on with your journey. I am thankful for all the\
  \ lessons that my father\u2019s death has brought on to my life. Of course I would\
  \ love to hug him and have the opportunity to tell him how much I love him one more\
  \ time. But I know he is watching over me and will continue on being my life\u2019\
  s biggest blessing."
