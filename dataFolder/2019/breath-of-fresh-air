Text: "I went to Bali in a short notice - in there I was running away from something.\
  \ I didn't plan on it but my father booked a flight there for a job he had to do\
  \ there. So I tagged along and traveled alone around Bali while my father was working\
  \ the whole time. I didn't exactly know what to expect, but I had a driver who was\
  \ ready to take me anywhere I wanted to go. \n\nThe first thing I did was step on\
  \ the hot summer day, at the beach, wearing jeans and a shirt. With the many tourists\
  \ who probably were wondering as to why I was fully clothed, but that was something\
  \ I had yet to discover. I was mesmerized by the whole thing, learning new things\
  \ from the driver fresh from Bali and giving me pep talks the whole ride to a specific\
  \ destination. \n\nOf course, everyone was friendly. They didn't care about what\
  \ we wear in there, because it's just how sunny it is. So, the next day I decided\
  \ to wear shorts freely, surrounded by people who did the same thing. I felt like\
  \ that girl from Travelling Pants who got rid of her long skirts and dresses. Also,\
  \ I felt like I finally fit in somewhere, after quite some time struggling to feel\
  \ like I belong. I was happy. Even though I was traveling alone while everyone was\
  \ probably with their peers, but I found myself. I found things that I hadn't been\
  \ able to find if I never went to Bali in the first place. It was a good feeling.\
  \ \n\nObviously, all good things must come to an end. My travel days were over and\
  \ I had yet to come back to my day-to-day routine. But at least, I was feeling brand\
  \ new again."
