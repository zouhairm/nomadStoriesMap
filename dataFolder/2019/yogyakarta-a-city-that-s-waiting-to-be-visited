Text: "If you used to be scared of going out for an unaccompanied trip, then you need\
  \ to read this story. This is a story of my last trip during summer break in Yogyakarta.\
  \ Frankly, that was my first solo trip and the reason why I picked the city was\
  \ because it has everything: mountains, beaches, culture, foods, historical sites,\
  \ and I heard that people are very nice.\nIt was quite a long trip from Jakarta\
  \ to Yogyakarta. It took 8 hours before I could finally I arrived in the rail station\
  \ at 6 am. Well, I picked a business class-train and I talked a lot to a guy sitting\
  \ next to me which is a student in Yogyakarta.\nMy first morning in Yogyakarta was\
  \ terrific. After I finally I arrived in the rail station, I decided to directly\
  \ go to my first destination. It was a well known street called malioboro which\
  \ we could walk directly from the rail station cause it\u2019s very closed. Actually,\
  \ we could just rent a bike for free but I decided to walk the street to enjoy this\
  \ pleasant morning. Furthermore, it had everything to provide along side the street,\
  \ such as variant of breakfast menus, coffee, souvernir, etc. I saw people having\
  \ their breakfast along the street, so I grabed a pecel, a local dish containing\
  \ boiled vegetables mixed with a spicy-sweet peanut sauce. Well, it tasted good\
  \ and surprisingly, it costed only IDR 5,000,-. After I finished with my breakfast\
  \ and then I came to a hotel which located alongside the street to put my stuff.\
  \ \nFrom the hotel, I decided to travel the downtown using an andong which went\
  \ fun. Andong is a traditional vehicle in Yogyakarta and it\u2019s more like a horse-drawn\
  \ carriage. Actually, It felt a little weird sitting on a horse-drawn carriage but\
  \ I still can enjoy. We went traveling the downtown and we had a good conversation.\
  \ We went through palaces, souvernir shops, market, water castle, etc. The andong-dude\
  \ was so nice, he told me a lot of thing about the city, the history, the culture,\
  \ and destinations to visit. Finally, the downtown tour took for an hour and it\
  \ costed IDR 80,000,-.\nSpending afternoon at Puncak Becici was my favorite thing\
  \ to do in Yogyakarta. As I already said, the city has everything to visit including\
  \ its mountain. Well, there is a tourist destination in Yogyakarta which was basically\
  \ a hill top called Puncak Becici providing a wonderful sunset view. It took an\
  \ hour for me from the hotel to the spot using motorbike and the trip was fascinating.\
  \ We could see the pine forest alongside the road and riding motorbike could be\
  \ the best choice cause we could enjoy the smell of pine trees. On top of that,\
  \ we could see the beautiful mount merapi from up there which was great. The real\
  \ show began when the sun went down. It was a perfect combination of the yellowish\
  \ sky and a sparkling city view from above the hill top. Actually, that was one\
  \ of the unforgattable hours in my life. I finished the trip at 8 pm and went back\
  \ to the hotel.\nNight attractions are everywhere alongside malioboro street. When\
  \ I arrived on the hotel after my trip in Puncak Becici, I saw people everywhere\
  \ surrounding the street. As I walked by the street, there were so many night attractions\
  \ provided by some street performers such as street theater show, traditional music\
  \ show, wayang show, and many more. It was great the people are all there spending\
  \ their times enjoying the night attratcion. In fact, being there in the middle\
  \ of the crowd had made me realize that I am not alone in this universe.\nFinally,\
  \ I only spend 2 days staying in Yogyakarta. During my second day I visited water\
  \ castle and sultan palace. But still, there are much more places I hadn\u2019t\
  \ already visited. On top of that, people are very nice and they were everywhere.\
  \ Finally, I realized that it wasn\u2019t a big problem to go for a solo travel\
  \ cause we\u2019re not alone. There are a lot of people and wonderful places in\
  \ this world waiting to be found."
