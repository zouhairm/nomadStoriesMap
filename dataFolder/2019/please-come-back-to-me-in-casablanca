Text: "A few years ago, I worked as a tour manager for a popular Russian rock band,\
  \ and once we received an invitation to perform at the birthday party of a nouveau\
  \ riche. This young man was a fan of our creativity and he rented a small boutique\
  \ hotel in a beautiful oasis in Marrakech for a week. All rooms of this hotel were\
  \ occupied by his friends and beautiful models from different countries. \nI, a\
  \ fool, succumbed to the bohemian way of life and bravely swallowed some slippery\
  \ filth from my plate, for which in half an hour I paid. I have never felt so bad,\
  \ I missed all the fun without leaving the bathroom.\nIn the morning we went by\
  \ bus to Casablanca, along a beautiful flat road, we flew to the airport earlier\
  \ and therefore I had the idea to swim in the Atlantic Ocean.\nOur rock stars by\
  \ this time were very hungry and demanded to bring them to some eatery with burgers.\
  \ The driver brought us to Beach Lalla Meryem, a small neat McDonalds pavilion stood\
  \ on the shore and everyone went to breakfast. I felt overwhelmed after a sleepless\
  \ night and I could not even look at the food. So I went ashore.\nA sandbank with\
  \ huge boulders, covered with algae, volcanic surface and puddles underfoot, and\
  \ sad and silent Moroccans sit on the stones and sadly look beyond the horizon.\
  \ Giant waves crash against the shore about 300 meters from the stones, and against\
  \ the background of this wall, boys play football made of water, foam and dust of\
  \ the sea.\nOur guys felt uncomfortable with the surrounding atmosphere and therefore\
  \ did not dare to go to the waves, but I needed to refresh myself, put my body in\
  \ order and I stubbornly reached the water, threw off jeans and a T-shirt and ran\
  \ into the cold ocean. It was exactly what I needed! I was able to stand in ice\
  \ water for no more than ten minutes, but this was enough for me to feel like a\
  \ newborn!\nAll soaked with salt of the Atlantic, cheerful and happy, my hair was\
  \ like a mohawk of London punk - stuck out in different directions, I confess, I\
  \ did not look like a tour manager of a rock band.\nAnd so we arrived at Casablanca\
  \ airport, before the flight to Madrid for about an hour and a half, and we are\
  \ not in a hurry, we get in line to check in, someone goes for souvenirs, and I\
  \ admire my eyes from both sides.\nWhat a riot of fantasy nature and human imagination!\
  \ It seems that in this place were all the peoples and tribes of Africa - people\
  \ who have the most different skin tones, different forms of eyes and lips, different\
  \ hairstyles, jewelry and clothes! The exotic, which I saw in the school textbook\
  \ of Geography and on the photo in the advertising booklets of travel agencies -\
  \ all these wonders passed me by speaking wonderful languages \u200B\u200Band dialects.\
  \ I felt like a pioneer of an unknown continent and could not take my eyes off these\
  \ beautiful and proud people!\nWhile I stood with my mouth open and turned my head,\
  \ my comrades went through the registration and went outside the wall inside the\
  \ inspection sector. There are only two English students in front of me \u2014 they\
  \ happily toss passports at the counter \u2014 and once! A bummer - the guy behind\
  \ the desk mumbles timidly about something like some sort of \u201Csorrioverbooking\u201D\
  ! The English students are shocked, they start stuttering and swearing, and I try\
  \ to get from my memory what overbooking it is? I can not remember, but in the corner\
  \ of consciousness flashes a red light bulb and the words - dude, this is a problem!\n\
  At this moment, an immense African matron with a huge turban approaches the check-in\
  \ counter and begins to command loudly. Behind her back, three baleen men loomed\
  \ sadly, trying to keep a cart with three skyscrapers from their luggage and leather\
  \ bags with Louis Vuitton logos from falling. As if the ghosts near the pillars\
  \ are materializing out of nowhere, three more women in black veils - only eyes\
  \ that pierce you like arrows are visible!\nIn general, it looked as if the queen\
  \ of the tribe from the very heart of Africa, with her husbands and servants, went\
  \ on a trip to the shops of Madrid and took with her part of her kingdom in the\
  \ Louis Vuitton brand suitcases.\nThe airport employees look in horror at these\
  \ huge heaps of baggage and begin to bang something, waving their hands and shaking\
  \ their heads. The entire royal gang, driven by their leader, begins to persuade\
  \ the clerks to be more kindly with her Queen - and ... After five minutes, the\
  \ queen's baggage problem begins to be solved by the entire male population from\
  \ the nearest check-in counters, the woman\u2019s shouts become threatening and\
  \ three brave men in camouflage appear and with machine guns.\nThey leisurely and\
  \ very professionally surround the screaming donna and begin to admonish her, but\
  \ the raging lady makes an unforgivable mistake at that moment - she begins to hand\
  \ out the crackle to the soldiers.\nIn the blink of an eye, all the king's army\
  \ put their noses on the floor, a dozen policemen appear, guns, machine guns, handcuffs\
  \ flash around us, suitcases fall, fabrics crack and harsh commands are heard, and\
  \ after a few minutes silence. The arrested queen and her men are taken away, the\
  \ girls in black are sown behind them, picking up suitcases, the British are neither\
  \ dead nor alive. The manager carefully peeks out from under the registration desk,\
  \ he straightens up, wipes his forehead with a handkerchief, snatches passports\
  \ from students' hands, gives them boarding passes, clicks the seal loudly and smiles,\
  \ says - Welcome! Next please!\nI galloped into the airport and began to tell my\
  \ comrades that story - they looked at me as an idiot and were advised not to eat\
  \ oysters anymore, since they cause such delusional visions."
