Text: "Upon arriving to Kuching, Malaysia, my hastily thinking was in full speed \u2013\
  \ far from the methodic wisdom of cats \u2013 \u201COdd? Why would they have cat\
  \ statues positioned in the center of this majestic city?\u201D I spewed. To no\
  \ answer from my partner and taxi driver. Large and unadorned, the statues seemed\
  \ out of place against the gold-plated Old State Mosque, Sarawak State Legislative\
  \ Assembly Building, Chinese temples, and the Dura Hana Bridge (rooted in traditional\
  \ Bidayuh). Religious and cultural monuments engulfed my attention effortlessly\
  \ and away from my inquisitive judgments about cats. \n \nIn preparing for this\
  \ trip, I read about the large Muslim population in Malaysia but I did not expect\
  \ to see women in jihads or burqas amongst women wearing short sleeveless dresses\
  \ patterned in sunflowers, poppies, and daises. Naively, this filled my mind with\
  \ worry: \u201CDo I need to be wearing one? I should have researched more about\
  \ religious sensitivity? Am I being disrespectful to this religion?\u201D Without\
  \ internet, when traveling, questions are left to be answered with time and from\
  \ your environment. And so, my first question verbally answered was by my bicycle\
  \ tour guide. I asked, \u201CIs it okay that I am not wearing a burqa?\u201D With\
  \ a friendly grin, the kind you give to a child whose question is filled with such\
  \ naiveness it warms your heart, she answered, \u201CYes, it is not a problem. Only\
  \ women who are Muslim wear burqas.\u201D It then dawned on me, a Muslim country\
  \ meant a large religious population it did not mean religious imposition for everyone\
  \ in Malaysia. Once this \u201Cmental reframe\u201D occurred so did the lens I was\
  \ experiencing Malaysia. Birthed in Los Angeles and born again in Wisconsin, a narrow\
  \ lens to begin with, this I knew. Now I noticed a country dancing collectively\
  \ with one another\u2019s religions and cultural traditions. Differences were respected\
  \ and admired. As the mosque bells rang to note time for prayer. I no longer fretted\
  \ for guidance. I simply did what I associated the sound of bells with \u2013Mindfulness.\
  \ I closed my eyes and brought attention to my breath. I was free to be my western-self\
  \ \u2013 half Cali\u2019 and half \u2018Sconsin.\n\nWithin three days of integration,\
  \ the acceptance of religious freedom created a 3-D experience, one of transparency,\
  \ acceptance, and inclusion. Releasing my initial confusion and subsequent list\
  \ of questions, I sat in a mesmerized state on the steps of The Kuching Old Courthouse.\
  \ Overlooking a squared courtyard, its well-manicured grass was centered with a\
  \ circular water fountain. Outlining the square were symmetrically placed white\
  \ columns before single-level buildings. Buildings that once housed Sarawak\u2019\
  s government officials. Now, a tourism center, an upscale bar, and a mostly all-white\
  \ casual eatery. I relaxed into the richness of it all. I watched towards the fountain\
  \ as a young couple posed for their wedding pictures. A groom wearing all-white\
  \ was joined by his bride in a vibrantly hued red and pink bejeweled dress. With\
  \ joy, I reflected on the thousands of traditions that fill our world and the vastness\
  \ of all the differences. In my reflection, my attention caught a woman with her\
  \ small child, both in a hijab, walking briskly pass the young couple and into the\
  \ \"mostly-white casual eatery.\" The door held open for her and her daughter by\
  \ a teenage girl wearing a Nike hat, navy blue tank-top and denim cut-off shorts.\n\
  \nIn that moment, I realized, I had cats all wrong. Cats are said to have nine lives\
  \ and even with this karmic luck they protect their lives wisely. When faced with\
  \ a decision, they methodically observe, wait (for the right time), and then act.\
  \ As such, Malaysia has done the same with the arrival of differing cultures and\
  \ religions - observed immigration, waited to make a decision and their action was\
  \ to create space. The people of Kuching know this wisdom very well, and so, cat\
  \ statues are honored proudly, even naming their city after them. In Kuching, Malaysia,\
  \ this cat-like approach has allowed all to co-exist, leaving travelers, like myself,\
  \ feeling as if I\u2019ve traveled to nine countries."
