Text: "Nowhere was the Cold War more evident in post-World War II Europe than crossing\
  \ Checkpoint Charlie into East Berlin. Between 1961 and 1989 the Berlin Wall served\
  \ as an imposing symbol of Communist oppression, and a literal and figurative barrier\
  \ between West and East Berlin. \n\nBy the 1980\u2019s West Berlin had begun to\
  \ shake off its painful past and rise again to lay claim as one of Europe\u2019\
  s premier cities. Modern architecture peaked out among the remaining historic buildings\
  \ lining the city\u2019s main shopping thoroughfare, the Ku\u2019Damm. The bombed-out\
  \ Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church served as a haunting reminder of the war and stood\
  \ in juxtaposition to nearby trendy caf\xE9s, galleries and shops. At night, bustling\
  \ shoppers gave way to those seeking a good meal or following the pulsating beat\
  \ of the discos. \n\nIn 1985, business took me to Berlin. There was a chill in the\
  \ air that week in March as the cold winter struggled to morph into Spring. After\
  \ hours, the city was ours to explore and a visit to \u201Cthe East\u201C was at\
  \ the top of the agenda. A cab delivered us to Checkpoint Charlie, the gateway to\
  \ East Berlin. The transit across the border separating the East and the West immediately\
  \ brought up images of espionage as our taxi was searched, passports scrutinized,\
  \ and the midnight curfew was assigned. \n\nUpon arrival in the East, one could\
  \ immediately sense the startling contrast between these distinct worlds. As modern\
  \ and prosperous as West Berlin was, East Berlin was caught in a time warp. The\
  \ darkness of the night gave the block of dimly-lit apartment buildings a film noir\
  \ setting with the silence broken now and then by the boxy Soviet cars. A short\
  \ distance from Checkpoint Charlie was a restaurant offering traditional East-German\
  \ fare. \n\nEntering the restaurant, we were greeted by wafts of cigarette smoke\
  \ and by a friendly young man, whose name is long forgotten, but whose face remains\
  \ vivid more than 30 years later. Unlike the West Berliners, many of whom spoke\
  \ English, our waiter only spoke German. By default, I became the translator for\
  \ the evening. \n\nConversation gradually turned to his life \u2013 filled with\
  \ dreams and aspirations, but tempered by a very predictable and limited reality.\
  \ He was about our age, but unlike ourselves who were exploring the world through\
  \ our careers, his travel was limited only to Soviet Bloc countries. His eyes lit\
  \ up when he learned we were from the United States and we swapped stories about\
  \ our lives. By the end of the evening we shared what little samples of our lives\
  \ that we had with us that night \u2013 a Florida map, perfume samples, logoed pens\
  \ \u2013 all treasures to our new friend. \n\nWe weren\u2019t fooled to think that\
  \ we were the only Americans with whom he had ever been in contact, but we\u2019\
  d like to think our connection was special. Perhaps because we were all of a similar\
  \ age or maybe because we realized that even with our differences, we were really\
  \ not that different.\n\nReturning in 1990, our same group of colleagues visited\
  \ the Berlin Wall and witnessed a city that was no longer divided. Even though it\
  \ had only been four months since the fall, throngs of visitors chipped away at\
  \ the remains of the wall for their mementos. Returning to Berlin many times since\
  \ that first trip, I still think of the young man at the restaurant near the border\
  \ who warmed my heart on a cold night, and can\u2019t help but wonder how his life\
  \ has changed since that historic event."
