Text: "We had been driving for twenty minutes already; having navigated ourselves,\
  \ with the help of an ageing Blackberry Curve, out of the leafy Southern Suburbs,\
  \ through the taxi lined streets leading into town. We were now within sniffing\
  \ distance of the sea salt. \n\u201CAre we almost there?\u201D Pieter asked, pinching\
  \ the top of his shirt to try and fan himself.\nI peered down at the screen of the\
  \ Blackberry in my hand. \u201CI think so.\u201D I wasn\u2019t sure. I hadn\u2019\
  t been sure of any of the directions I\u2019d offered on this journey, but we hadn\u2019\
  t gotten lost yet, so I thought it best not to mention that I had a habit of getting\
  \ lost.\nOn our right-hand side sat the imposing Table Mountain. We had to be close\
  \ by now. I could feel my hand vibrate as the phone alerted us to an upcoming left\
  \ turn. \n\u201CLeft!\u201D\n\u201CNow,\u2019 he asked, I could tell that he was\
  \ doubting me and the omnipresent Google Maps.\n\u201CYes,\u201D I said, trying\
  \ to sound confident.\nHe turned the Citi Golf left so that we were travelling up\
  \ a road that seemed more mountainous than I would\u2019ve expected for the last\
  \ stretch of a trip to the coast. On one side we were confronted with the view of\
  \ the centre of Cape Town and its harbour, to our other side a mountain range seemed\
  \ to be evolving. The road was winding further and further up, but the smell of\
  \ the sea and the old Blackberry propelling us forward seemed to be enough for us\
  \ to keep going.\n\u201CAre you sure that it says straight?\u201D By this point\
  \ I could tell that whatever faith Pieter had was dissipating.\n\u201CIt says straight\
  \ for a while,\u201D I had also lost faith in my navigational skills. \u201CAlso\
  \ there\u2019s nowhere for us to make a U-Turn.\u201D\nAs we continued to elevate\
  \ above Cape Town, and our hopes to get to the beach by eleven became more of a\
  \ fantasy, we started to appreciate the view around us. The way that the city and\
  \ nature seemed to happily overlap on each other made the increasing heat bearable.\
  \ We started to see parked cars around us and the road seemed to have given up its\
  \ trek up the hillside. \n\u201CPlease make a U-Turn,\u201D a robotic voice announced,\
  \ as Pieter stopped the car at the end of the road, sliding into an empty space\
  \ between two other cars.\n\u201CI think, I was wrong about that left turn.\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CObviously.\u201D He said, using his hand to shade his eyes. \u201CWe\u2019\
  re on top of a mountain.\u201D\nWe got out of the car and moved towards where most\
  \ people were posing for selfies. We looked over the edge and saw the city beneath\
  \ us, the tuffs of green trees, towering buildings and the oceanfront were all visible.\
  \ I pulled my camera from my bag and started to try and capture the beauty of the\
  \ city. \nWe hadn\u2019t spoken since getting out the car when he said: \u201CIt\u2019\
  s amazing.\u201D\n\u201CIt\u2019s definitely not the beach though.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Ja, but the view makes up for it.\u201D\n\u201CDo you know where we are?\u201D\n\
  He shook his head. \u201CNo clue.\u201D\nHe decided to ask a couple next to us to\
  \ see if they knew more about the geography of Cape Town than we did. While he was\
  \ gone, I took to snapping close-up photos of the flora on that ran down from where\
  \ we stood, dry pieces of veld were interwoven with more soft green leaves all the\
  \ way down until there were tall trees blocking the road. \n\u201CApparently, this\
  \ is Signal Hill.\u201D Pieter told me on his return. He turned me around to look\
  \ at a rock face that towered above us. \u201CAnd that is Lion\u2019s Head.\u201D\
  \n\u201CImpressive.\u201D\nWe alternated between taking in the view of the city\
  \ and that of Lion\u2019s Head for a few more minutes before deciding it might be\
  \ best to finally make our way to Clifton, like we\u2019d planned. Before we got\
  \ back into the car, we encouraged an American couple to take a picture of us being\
  \ touristy with the view of a mountain we didn\u2019t know existed until a few minutes\
  \ ago."
