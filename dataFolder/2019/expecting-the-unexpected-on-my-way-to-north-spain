Text: "First trip by myself across a big piece of water. I wasn\u2019t sure of what\
  \ to expect about this journey. What I was going to find, the people I was going\
  \ to meet. And well, everything went so good, but is after all the traveling when\
  \ I realize how much I enjoy it, even though, I did it every step I made.\nFirst\
  \ place, Madrid, exclusively because my 10 hours flight from Mexico arrived there,\
  \ I just needed to take a train directly to Santander, Northern part of Spain. It\
  \ was my second time in this beautiful city but in this case I was only passing\
  \ through. It was necessary to take a bus to Torrelavega, a small village that will\
  \ lead me to my final destination. \n     \nMy arrival to Torrelavega was nice.\
  \ At 2 pm I was already leaving the train station. However, what was my surprise\
  \ when I was out there? That I was in the middle of nowhere trying to find my way\
  \ to my next stop. \n     Anyway, it was Sunday. Do you know what does it means?\
  \ Well, that everything was closed, no people on streets, no people to ask any directions\
  \ and I was feeling kind of lost. So the noon became afternoon, a beautiful of course.\
  \ But as the day passed by, my back was hurting outrageous because obviously, nobody\
  \ taught me how to travel light. Anyhow, I had 25 kilos on my back and as an artist\
  \ 2 more bags with all this artist stuff: writing, painting, creating, etc. \n \
  \    \nAt the moment that I found a bus stop I could notice that I rested more than\
  \ I should. But a gentleman came to the rescue, he read completely my tired and\
  \ lost face so he asked me where I was heading to, for what I answered hopeful that\
  \ I was looking for a bus that could take me to Santillana del Mar, another very\
  \ small village, really close by. And he suggest me to accompany him in the next\
  \ bus so he can show me the bus station where I could buy a ticket to my destiny.\n\
  \nIt is important to mention that I had no internet and there was no free Wi-Fi.\
  \ Reason why it was very difficult to be in contact with my host.  It was a 15 minute\
  \ road trip to arrive to Santillana. And in the matter of fact, I decided to get\
  \ off the bus in front of a hostel, just in case I had to stay there. It was very\
  \ late, so the darkness prevail over the streets. In addition, I was so tired I\
  \ couldn\u2019t realize how beautiful the narrow stoned street was. \n    \nBy the\
  \ way, I entered to this hostel restaurant & bar to take a snack, I was starving.\
  \ In the mean while I ask for the Wi-Fi password and in that instant I started to\
  \ receive all the text messages from my host Eva where she was asking me if I wanted\
  \ to be picked up from the train station of Santander. Oh my god! Imagine when I\
  \ read this, almost I suffer a heart attack. I was quite far from that city long\
  \ time ago and now I had to reply her my actual location. She was impressed of my\
  \ dedication to find my way there. I think I felt the same way from myself as well.\
  \ She reach me up into the hostel and took me to Finca \u201CLa Garita\u201D where\
  \ I was going to stay for at least 15 days. \n\nAll my dramatic feeling disappear\
  \ when we arrived there and she introduced me to this other guests from France that\
  \ I get along very well with. And \u201CAll my troubles seem so far away\u201D (yes,\
  \ theme from The Beatles) when I tried the delicious French crepes that they cooked\
  \ that day. \n     \nAnd there I was in the other part of the world, in the middle\
  \ of this green and amazing hills, in the North of Spain. Tired but very pleased\
  \ with my ham and cheese crepe on my stomach."
