Text: "Riding on the back of the motorcycle behind the driver with his posterior sliding\
  \ perilously backwards, Luke\u2019s feet floated aimlessly, desperately seeking\
  \ something other than the hot exhaust to rest on, his face pressed awkwardly against\
  \ the soot encrusted roof that trapped in Erica, myself and our gear on a tiny bench\
  \ seat. Our ability to see was blocked by our luggage making it near impossible\
  \ for our driver to turn the contraption, and with each rotation of the wheel I\
  \ sensed impending doom and felt sure our overloaded \u201Cbecak\u201D was destined\
  \ to be swallowed up by a larger or faster piece of transportation.\nAnd so began\
  \ our mission to see wild Sumatran Orangutans. Squeezed into one of these iconic\
  \ rickshaws for the most cramped, exhilarating and terrifying ride of my life across\
  \ the charming madness that is Medan.\nAt last we reached Pinang Baris station;\
  \ a seemingly endless swarm of minibuses, where we began soaking in some of the\
  \ delights that characterize Indonesia. Everywhere, the pungent aroma of millions\
  \ of motorbike exhausts, coupled with the fumes of strong solvents being used by\
  \ a myriad of  industrious and talented mechanics to give new life to a huge array\
  \ of tired and worn out small engines. \nEventually we boarded a minibus for an\
  \ eight hour bum-numbing trip along twisting roads, inhaling the omnipresent cigarette\
  \ smoke, finally clambering out for a short break with splitting headaches and bursting\
  \ bladders at a popular gathering spot with noisy natives enjoying the grub on offer.\n\
  Before long I conjured up the guts to order \u201CAyem Gulong\u201D, a somewhat\
  \ ballsy proposition considering I didn\u2019t have the foggiest what was coming.\
  \ Erica was still trying to figure out how to use a longdrop toilet and Luke was\
  \ instead opting for the Indonesian variation of Oreo cookies! My meal arrived as\
  \ a chicken breast floating in liquid and so, with much trepidation, I pulled off\
  \ a piece of chicken only to discover it had been cooked in a delicious, spicy coconut\
  \ sauce. \nAfter a couple more hours, it was midnight when we reached our destination,\
  \ the town of Kutacane. Deposited outside the driver recommended Hotel Maroon, we\
  \ were happy to find a light on and a friendly face at the front desk, but our relief\
  \ quickly gave way to dismay at the sad state of our lodgings. \nDirty and rundown,\
  \ the stale scent of urine lingered over the dried, brown freckles that graced the\
  \ longdrop footpads. A bucket of water and a scoop were on offer to replace what\
  \ we previously considered a given; toilet paper and a flush mechanism. A few cold\
  \ drops of water could be eked out of the pipe opening showerhead, assuming one\
  \ was okay with slipping and sliding in the narrow, wee impregnated trough that\
  \ formed the shower basin. Three inch long cockroaches clawed their way out of the\
  \ floor drain. \nA rank old mattress lay in one corner and was Luke\u2019s slice\
  \ of heaven for the night as he lay, covered from head to toe in clothing, with\
  \ enough deet for an army, all under the blissful spell of an Ambien to allay his\
  \ concerns. \nNext to him lay Erica and I, cocooned in our recently acquired, insect\
  \ repellent, sleeping bag liners and similarly calmed by a sleeping pill induced\
  \ stupor, essential to quell our fears of the bugs undoubtedly skulking from our\
  \ sixty year old mattress. \nI had hoped to find orangutans on this trip, un-warped\
  \ by human interference, oblivious to their impending plight. I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find my entry into their world would also bring us to a place of unparalleled\
  \ beauty with storybook settings where our view of these great apes swinging through\
  \ the trees was occasionally obscured by steam from spectacular hot springs or where\
  \ butterflies so splendid would make me question if this was a psychedelic trip\
  \ rather than a real experience. \nI didn\u2019t expect to find the contrasts of\
  \ experience and the difficulty of getting around would contribute to how special\
  \ the adventure was, nor did I imagine I would cherish the bad with the good; but\
  \ the things one doesn\u2019t expect are very often the things that make the magic\
  \ of travel so rewarding."
