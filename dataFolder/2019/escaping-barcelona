Text: "As we were approaching the monastery on the top of Montserrat -the sacred mountain\
  \ of Catalu\xF1a, and to whom I share a name-, many passengers kept talking about\
  \ what happened yesterday in Barcelona. I didn\u2019t know any of them, but we could\
  \ see in our faces we were all escaping the city. And not even that gigantic saw\
  \ shaped mountain could take our minds away from that.\n\nThat day we were all trying\
  \ to leave behind happened two years ago, a few days later I arrived in Barcelona\
  \ on August 15, 2017, in a suffocating humidity and what it felt as a hundred degree\
  \ temperature. But it didn\u2019t matter. I was there for the biggest party of the\
  \ year: The \u201CFesta Major de Gr\xE0cia\u201D, which in catalan translate as\
  \ the \u201Cparty of the people\u201D, an annual celebration hosted by one the most\
  \ iconic neighborhoods of Barcelona, Gr\xE0cia. \n\nAfter leaving my bags in the\
  \ hostel, in Sans -another neighborhood having a big party those days-, I took the\
  \ subway that afternoon to meet Marcelo, a friend from Chile, that lived there now.\
  \ \n\nAs we were walking through the streets, red devils from all sizes appeared\
  \ in almost every corner. Other streets were covered by colorful ribbons, birds\
  \ and books. There was even a replica of King Kong climbing the Empire State, which\
  \ were all made by the neighbors of Gr\xE0cia.\n\nWe danced and drunk beer until\
  \ 7 am, and we were ready to go again that same night. \n\nThree days later and\
  \ fully recovered from one of my biggest hangovers, me and Marcelo arranged a shopping\
  \ day in La Rambla, the main street of the city, full of stores and tourists. But\
  \ after walking all day visiting monuments, around 5 pm I was worn out, so I called\
  \ him to bail. \u201CIt\u2019s ok. I will go now and we\u2019ll meet there later\u201D\
  , he replied.\n\nAt 5.15 pm I was finally in my bed. My eyes were closing, but I\
  \ wanted to check Twitter before sleeping. \u201CTerrorist attack in Barcelona\u201D\
  \ appeared on my screen. The Tweet also mentioned La Rambla as the place of the\
  \ attack. An instant rush of blood went straight to my face and made me jump out\
  \ of bed, when I remembered my friend was there. I called him several times, but\
  \ there was no answer.\n\nFive hours later, Marcelo called me. \u201CA white car\
  \ came towards us, and everybody started to run. I entered the first shop I saw\
  \ and hide. Some of them were bleeding. It was horrible\u201D, he told me.\n\nThat\
  \ day, the police announced that all the parties of the city were cancelled, and\
  \ the streets were emptied for security purposes. \u201CDon\u2019t leave your home\
  \ until it\u2019s safe outside. One of the attackers is still on the run\u201D,\
  \ said one the many messages the national guard of Catalu\xF1a posted on their Twitter\
  \ account. \n\nThe next day, I went to the train station anyway and bought a ticket\
  \ to Montserrat.\n\nThe train was in full capacity, and the collective fear was\
  \ visible. \u201C\xBFCould he be the attacker?, \xBFor him?\u201D I kept saying\
  \ to myself through all the way.\n\nInside the monastery, home of Montserrat, the\
  \ black Virgin and patroness of Catalu\xF1a, and old lady with who I started talking\
  \ during an hour line to see the virgin, told me she came here once a month to touch\
  \ her hand and pray. I'm not a religious person, but that day I touched the hand\
  \ of the virgin's statue to thank that my friend was alive, and prayed for the victims\
  \ of the attack. For some reason, I felt heard. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to comeback\
  \ to Barcelona. I finally started feeling safe enough to let go the attacks. But\
  \ at the end of the day, we all did.\n\nBack in Sans, I saw the neighbors setting\
  \ a big table on the street. I asked them if the party was going to happen anyway.\
  \ \u201CYes, tomorrow. We don\u2019t like to live in fear, so we are going to celebrate\
  \ we are alive\u201D, one of the guys in charge of the music equipment told me.\n\
  \nThat night I sat with them in the big table to celebrate just that."
