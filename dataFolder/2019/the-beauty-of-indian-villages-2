Text: "My love for traveling, started with an invitation from my friends (Gauri) sister\
  \ (Soni) to attend her wedding at their village.My flight landed at Lal Bahadur\
  \ Shastri Varanasi Airport. Gauri came to receive me, her village was 3hrs away\
  \ from the airport, so we started our journey and I was so dumstuck with the beauty\
  \ of the road side farms, I asked about the plantation she told me it\u2019s wheat\
  \ farming, till the extent I can see I fall in love with the beautiful wheat farm,\
  \ we were crossing the local markets and to my astonishment those small shops by\
  \ the corner of the road side had everything from clothing to household amenities,\
  \ general stores, I saw a cart full of sugarcane and a machine through which the\
  \ sugarcane is passed and crushed and the juice coming out from the other side then\
  \ a pinch of few drops of lemon, mint and ice was added, I couldn\u2019t control\
  \ the urge of enjoying the drink it was just so refreshing. We again started and\
  \ this time I happened to see the sugarcane farms, and by the corner of the farm\
  \ a small mud house was there and a person was sitting in front of a huge mud burner\
  \ (Mitti ka Chulha)from which the flames were coming out and a huge deep pot (kadhaii)\
  \ was kept on the top of it and sugarcane juice was cooked in it to make jaggery\
  \ out of it, It was so mouth watering.\nFinally we reached the village( Jagdishpur)\
  \ but before entering the village we are supposed to worship the Mahadeva Temple\
  \ ( Lord Shiva temple) it is said that we can\u2019t enter his territory without\
  \ his permission, so we bowed down at the temple perform the rituals and took the\
  \ blessing.\nAs we started towards her home the lane was so thin going between the\
  \ farms only a professional driver and a local from that area can drive, and here\
  \ we are to my friends place, as I got down from the taxi I was overlooking a 36\
  \ pilars sitting area, almost 50 no. Of four legged traditional bed was placed and\
  \ more than 100 men were sitting, chit chatting enjoying snacks sweets tea and it\
  \ was all a personalised service and the servers were brothers of the bride. I also\
  \ happened to see a well that was cemented and a hand pump attached two men were\
  \ taking bath. The strangest thing I couldn\u2019t see any female as I stepped towards\
  \ the door, it\u2019s beauty freezed me for the moment 7ft. long doors Like we have\
  \ watched in movies made of pure woods full of small squares and from those square\
  \ a small cone pointing out, and the borders of the wood was beautifully crafted\
  \ with images of elephant as we entered the door I saw a tulsi plant planted in\
  \ a cemented vase with a dia on the left inside that cemented vase and again another\
  \ sitting area for ladies. The bride was sitting in the centre and the ladies of\
  \ the house next to her and pandit Ji  (priest) was chanting some shlokas and other\
  \ village ladies were singing traditional songs, playing dholak and dancing. According\
  \ to the tradition the would be bride was suppose to be taken to their kul Devi\
  \ (Godess) \u201CAtharahi Mata \u201Cmeans 18 in no. She takes care of 18 villages\
  \ so she has got the name as I was passing from the village the simplicity of the\
  \ people, the generosity such a simple living ouches me the air was so fresh, I\
  \ can easiy find people milking their cow small kids naked dancing in front of the\
  \ Dhol wala (musician) and gathering the toffees and coins thrown by the brides\
  \ aunty and mother, we were walking and dancing on the mud street, most of the houses\
  \ were made of Mud . Finally we reached the temple the mother prepared the Prasad\
  \ of Poori and Halwa and offered to the Goddess for the Happy Married life of their\
  \ daughter.\nAn experience that change the meaning of my traveling and enlightened\
  \ me to discover and travel more such places."
