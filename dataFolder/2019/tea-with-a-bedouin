Text: "We wound our way over the dirt paths as the sun inched downwards, silently\
  \ filling the valley with its orange glow. Petra. It was stunning, with its winding\
  \ passages and ancient facades carved from towering rock faces. We\u2019d completed\
  \ the classic tourist checklist; view the Treasury from above, clamber up the endless\
  \ stairs to the Monastery, navigate the throngs of tourists and turn down numerous\
  \ \u2018special deals\u2019 from Bedouin guides who all resembled Jack Sparrow.\
  \ The three of us had met that morning and spent the whole day wandering round,\
  \ our legs ached, but we were determined to reach the \u2018High Place\u2019 atop\
  \ the monstrous rock mountains to watch the sunset. \nWe briefly left the path to\
  \ grab a photo, when suddenly a man appeared out of nowhere. For a moment we were\
  \ startled by his sudden materialization until we realized he had emerged from a\
  \ small doorway cut into the rock. I didn\u2019t instantly recognize that he was\
  \ a Bedouin because he wasn\u2019t dressed as a suave pirate like the rest, but\
  \ he waved us over so we approached. As we neared he pointed at the entrance, \u201C\
  Come! Come have tea, welcome!\u201D Ducking through the doorway we found his wife\
  \ sitting cross-legged on a thin straw mat, tea already brewing, in a constant state\
  \ of readiness for any wandering tourists who happened across their home. Without\
  \ looking up she mumbled an inaudible welcome as her husband threw a squab on the\
  \ ground for our comfort, before disappearing out the door. \nSo there we sat, silence\
  \ broken only by the simmering of hot water. Somewhere in the distance a donkey\
  \ echoed its melodies across the ancient valley. The woman sat preparing dinner,\
  \ years of hard work written in the deep furrows across her face. It felt uncomfortable\
  \ to accept such hospitality from a complete stranger so I broke the silence, using\
  \ what little Arabic I knew to ask her name. I was later told that this is a no-go\
  \ between men and women in Bedouin culture, but she -not so discretely- covered\
  \ by instead reiterating in mumbles that she did, indeed, live here. And so we sat\
  \ in the evening\u2019s silence, drinking tea and exchanging looks of amazement\
  \ accompanied with occasionally mouthing \u201Cwow?!\u201D \nThat\u2019s when it\
  \ arrived. Inquisitively peering around the corner of the door came this four legged,\
  \ cloven hoofed, woolen foe. A bedraggled sheep had split from the Bedouins\u2019\
  \ herd and shuffled over to explore the indoor world. At first it appeared to be\
  \ innocently glancing in, until it caught a whiff of the simmering dinner and edged\
  \ forwards. Muttering a warning the lady waved it off with a hand to no avail. It\
  \ took another step. The woman shouted begrudgingly and tried to shoo the creature\
  \ away but it ignored her and stepped across the threshold, intent on coming inside.\
  \ After more inaudible murmuring under her breath her eyes scanned the room, settling\
  \ on an intricately carved wooden cylinder. Bingo. Compelled by an irritation that\
  \ seemed to transcend her age, she leaned backwards onto her forearms and clutched\
  \ a hand on the block. Straightening up, she gave the sheep one last momentary grunt\
  \ of warning before -with complete disregard for aim- hurling the wooden projectile\
  \ at the open doorway. The block bounced off the animals\u2019 woolen behind! Point\
  \ blank in the line of fire it spun in a flurry of dreads and dags, clattering its\
  \ hooves and disappearing off around the corner.\nProblem solved. We almost spat\
  \ our tea across the rocks in laughter, the woman simply clambered upright and turned\
  \ back to the stove to complete dinner.\nJust another day in the life of a Bedouin."
