Text: "Nestled in a valley between the Western Ghats of India, there is a small community\
  \ which hosts people from around the world.  People are welcome if they want to\
  \ contribute to an unusual initiative, Vanastree, which supports women who are trying\
  \ to sustain biodiversity. The chance to stay with a farming family and explore\
  \ the region is very special.\n\nThe house was poorly lit, every evening, thin candles\
  \ and oil lamps were all we had to see by, apart from the flashlights we carried.\
  \ While we cooked and ate chapattis with different spicy vegetables, the single\
  \ bulb in the kitchen illuminated our host\u2019s face as she told us about her\
  \ life. Her chattiness was wasted on me as I could only partially understand her\
  \ rapid speech. I nodded along, trying to find meaning in the mix of Marathi and\
  \ Kannada that made up her dialect. My friend was familiar with both, and held her\
  \ own, she even translated for me. \n\nWe had been there for a few days, it was\
  \ the last day of our stay with the elderly lady who farmed a small patch of land\
  \ in north-western Karnataka. As she spoke to my friend, it became clear she was\
  \ talking about a distressing topic. My friend refused to tell me what they were\
  \ discussing. We had a fairly uneventful night in our sleeping bags in the small\
  \ entry room.\n\nI wake up in the morning, prepared for a final day of exploration\
  \ and get my friend to finally share the information which had made her jumpy throughout\
  \ the night. It was clear the news was terrifying her. Once she told me, I was no\
  \ longer scared, but there was a whir in my mind.  \n\nSleeping in the same spot\
  \ where a man had hung himself did not disturb me as much as the thought of the\
  \ thousands of families of farmers who experience this every year. I did not feel\
  \ the loss of a son or family member, unlike our host. After her son committed suicide,\
  \ she was all alone, left with no one else to share her life and responsibilities.\
  \  Perhaps that contributed to how warmly she welcomed us and opened her home to\
  \ us. \n\nAs we left the small bu beloved home and returned to our lives in a city\
  \ not so far away, but with very different concerns, I was reminded of the headlines\
  \ I had been reading and listening to for years. \u201CFarmers commit suicide\u2026\
  \u201D has been reported far too many times.  The details of the particular region\
  \ being plagued by a drought, flooding, or a number of other environmental or market\
  \ factors usually varied. These events should not be so overwhelming to such a significant\
  \ portion of the Indian population. And yet, a few seasons, or even one really poor\
  \ season with failing crop is enough to drive an Indian farmer to a pit of despair\
  \ that is unfathomable to many of us. \n\nIndia remains an agrarian nation. You\
  \ cannot have a real picture of this country without an understanding of the farmers\
  \ who contribute immeasurably to Indian lives. Before this trip, I didn\u2019t have\
  \ this understanding either. The journey into farm life, though it was just for\
  \ a week, was eye-opening. It let me see my life with fresh eyes when I returned\
  \ to all the amenities, especially electricity, running water, and an en suite bathroom!\
  \ But these don\u2019t make up for fresh air, lush forests surrounding your home,\
  \ and the vast sky filled with clouds of all shapes on a perfect day in the Western\
  \ Ghats. Comparing a city and a farm is futile, we have to capture the best of both\
  \ wherever we find ourselves living."
