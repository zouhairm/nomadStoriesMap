Text: "Late afternoon and me and my partner John were riding back to home stay in\
  \ a big road in an Indonesian village, Lombok. We were on the main road busy with\
  \ hundreds of motorbikes, cars and trucks passing both ways. They were fast. The\
  \ road had no traffic signs whatsoever. While John and I were trying to cross the\
  \ road to turn to the street on the right, all of a sudden, we appeared on the ground.\
  \ We fell down while attempting to turn right, after crossing the road. It occurred\
  \ in a second. However, I stood up quickly and asked, \u201CHoney, are you OK?\u201D\
  \ The response was, \u201CIt\u2019s on my leg! It\u2019s on my leg!\u201D  \nI attempted\
  \ to lift the scooter off his leg, but I failed. At that moment, a man in grey T-shirt\
  \ appeared from out of nowhere. He was local and modestly dressed. He happened to\
  \ be a scooter taxi driver. He quickly lifted the vehicle and freed John. We looked\
  \ at each other to see if we had any injuries. The blood dripping onto the scooter\
  \ but we could not see where it was coming from. Then, I saw it was coming from\
  \ John\u2019s elbow. Ouch! I started panicking, as the cut was rather deep. I had\
  \ never seen human flesh in my life. I was frightened. John started asking himself,\
  \ \u201CHow did that happen? What went wrong?\u201D\nLuckily, there was a pharmacy\
  \ nearby. We ran into it and asked the pharmacist to help us cover the injury. She\
  \ did so, but we knew that was not a long-term solution. We needed a hospital. The\
  \ cop nearby, whom it was harder to convince, rode John in his scooter to the hospital.\
  \ The taxi driver who freed John from the vehicle rand I followed them.   \nWe arrived\
  \ a few minutes later. When I entered the hospital, John was already in the emergency\
  \ room with a nurse attending his injury. Meanwhile, as John described: \u201Ca\
  \ quietly competent nurse who had rather moderate Muslim dresses on\u201D was attending\
  \ his injury. The scene of a Muslim woman operating on a Westerner\u2019s (his)\
  \ arm seemed humorous to him. She did not speak English neither did we speak Indonesian.\
  \ However, there was no need for words. The nurse had a soothing smile on her face.\
  \ She knew exactly what to do as if she had done it hundreds of times. With no questions,\
  \ she cleaned up the wound and put six stitches on John\u2019s arm. \nIn the meantime,\
  \ John was replaying the incident scene in his head repeatedly. He tried to understand\
  \ what went wrong. It frustrated him not knowing the cause of the accident. I told\
  \ him not obsess over it as everything was good after all. He was relaxed.  \nThe\
  \ most shocking part of the story though for him was the cost of the medical aid.\
  \ The hospital charged us 50,000 rupiah, which is three dollars and fifty cents.\
  \ He said it was laughable, as back in the US he would have costed him hundred times\
  \ more, just for the ambulance call itself. Of course, if it were in the US, there\
  \ would have been a whole procedure for this type of episode and different one.\
  \ \nJohn was amazed though that the two strange men helped us. The operation at\
  \ the hospital was smooth and efficient. There were no questions about where he\
  \ was from and no forms to fill out. They immediately put him in the emergency room.\
  \ It was quick. It was efficient. It was natural. It was humane.\nBack in the US,\
  \ John told the story to a number of people who shared their completely different\
  \ experiences and nightmarish stories with the hospital system in the US. Not surprisingly,\
  \ in the US, the hospital system is much more complex. There are procedures for\
  \ everything. Going through an emergency room might not be as smooth. Moreover,\
  \ Americans overpay for healthcare yet they still have to wait weeks or even months\
  \ to get an appointment. \nWe are well now. Everything is behind! John was very\
  \ impressed by this. He learned good lessons to take back home from a developing\
  \ country."
