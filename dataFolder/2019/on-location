Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself on public transit while strangers felt\
  \ my hair; nor did I expect to be in the front row of a Rolling Stones concert while\
  \ my brother nodded off next to me. However, that\u2019s what travel does, the unexpected.\
  \ \nIn 2003 my mother\u2019s production company was contracted to produce a televised\
  \ concert. With my brother being 10, and myself being seven, my single mother made\
  \ the choice to bring us along for the 10 days or so of shooting. \nThere is no\
  \ better, or maybe more Hollywood way to experience a culture than following around\
  \ a camera crew and a charming host. I constantly poked my head where I probably\
  \ didn\u2019t belong, asking the crew where we were going next, screaming when a\
  \ shrimp crawled on my hand at the Ladies Market and earnestly replying \u201Cyes\u201D\
  \ when the host asked my brother and me if she looked like she had forehead wrinkles\
  \ when she made a certain face.  \nOne misty, dreamlike early morning I watched\
  \ as the crew set up cameras to film Tai Chi. I had no idea what that was. When\
  \ I asked I was told it was like slow fighting meets dancing, I was sold. I impatiently\
  \ waited as I saw more and more people take their place on a stone path amongst\
  \ the haze and otherwise grassy surroundings. I can clearly remember one older man\
  \ as he moved it seemed easy, effortless, powerful and soft. I was told I was allowed\
  \ to join in, but being seven and shy I held back. I tried to hold back my giggles\
  \ as some of the crew joined in, lacking the grace and strength of the active practitioners.\
  \ \nEven drives back to the hotel were utterly mystifying. After a long day of location\
  \ shooting, being stuck in traffic was almost welcome. As my eyes began to feel\
  \ heavy someone pointed out a building with a huge hole in it, \u201Cfor the dragon\
  \ to fly through\u201D they told me. I knew dragons weren\u2019t real...but there\
  \ was no way that hole was for nothing. Maybe, just maybe there could be one here.\
  \ The culture was dripping with mythology and tradition that the idea of there actually\
  \ being a dragon that could fly through this skyscraper didn't seem so far fetched.\
  \ \nNot only did I have every chance to see all Hong Kong had to offer, but it also\
  \ came with front row ticket to The Rolling Stones, Prince, and a few other artists\
  \ that appealed to the MTV audience of 2003. I remember the grown-ups telling me\
  \ how cool it was that I was going to see the Rolling Stones and Prince, but I was\
  \ clueless to the timeless magnitude that these legends created. My brother and\
  \ I were tired from a long travel day and when we found our mom she hugged us, gave\
  \ us some earplugs, and walked us to the front row. I tried my best to be excited,\
  \ I\u2019ve always loved music, and everyone else was exuberant. Nevertheless, jetlag\
  \ is relentless, especially on little kids. I stood and enjoyed the music for a\
  \ while, I looked to my left to see my brother had already lost the battle to time\
  \ change and was asleep in his chair. I gave in and let myself sit down, telling\
  \ myself \u201CI can sit and stay awake,\u201D and then \u201CI can rest my eyes\
  \ and stay awake\u201D until sleep finally took me as well. I wonder if Mick Jagger\
  \ ever looked into the front row to see two sleeping preteens, I\u2019m sure if\
  \ he did, he would have thought it was funny. Maybe he would have thought it was\
  \ something he didn\u2019t expect to find either."
