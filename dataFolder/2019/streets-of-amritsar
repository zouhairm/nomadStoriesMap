Text: "Amritsar has always been close to my heart especially during summer vacation\
  \ during school  and college days  , the excitement of going to Santacruz , Bombay\
  \ airport early morning and flying down to New Delhi followed by connecting Shatabdi\
  \ express to Amritsar Jn . The fun of having free meals back then in flights and\
  \ given toys or bags is still fresh in my mind . \n\nOn reaching Amritsar Jn , welcomed\
  \ by our close relatives by never ending hugs ( that\u2019s what Punjabi\u2019s\
  \ are famous for ) we don\u2019t greet by shaking hands we give warm and never ending\
  \ hugs , as they were from the village of Ludhiana a few hundred kilometres  from\
  \ Amritsar they left in a day back as Mom , Bhai (Brother) and I wished to stay\
  \ in the city and enjoy our holidays by visiting Golden Temple . \n\nWe stayed in\
  \ a Sarai ( Lodge sponsored by charitable Trusts) near to the Golden temple vicinity\
  \ Ie Hall Bazaar , the streets had hustle - bustle all day long with cycle rickshaws\
  \ , pedestrians, hawkers walking on a small one way road . The aroma of punjabi\
  \ food from different stalls of Samosas , Puri Channa couldn\u2019t stop us not\
  \ from trying it but mummy was very strict no outside food only Langar ( Food from\
  \ Free kitchen) at Golden temple or home cooked food at the Sarai , still remember\
  \ the Cook was specially hired for us .\n\nDays were long and Nights short , so\
  \ generally we used to visit Gurudwara at Night and the streets in afternoon generally\
  \ to shop or getting Pathani suits tailored (Long cotton Robes ) remember those\
  \ days bhai and I joined a few hobby classes like learning tabla , learning to tie\
  \ turban , learning Gurmukhi scriptures but we\u2019re always accompaniedby Mr Badal\
  \ Uncle ( that\u2019s what we fondly called him ) to all these classes as we were\
  \ new to the city \n\nDescribing Badal uncle he was an old man maybe in his late\
  \ 60s , wrinkles on his face due to constant smiling I guess , height around 5,10\
  \ feet , slim and fair toned , walked at a fairly fast pace , now we majorly knew\
  \ Hindi or English as growing up in Mumbai since 11 years but Badal uncle only knew\
  \ Punjabi .\n\nHe used to take us in cycle rickshaws , around in the city heat and\
  \ dust , with constant blow horn of scooters and bikes but being with him was soothing\
  \ because he had stories to tell , of which was of good friend who he parted during\
  \ partition of India and Pakistan , they both were swimming buddies who grew up\
  \ in Lahore and described the streets to be exactly similar like Amritsar . \n\n\
  In summers they used to wake up early and play with marbles and then go for a swim\
  \ in the pond nearby Satpal as he fondly called him , he remembered that once Satpal\
  \ saved his life as he was about to bit by a deadly snake and how swiftly he slowly\
  \ convinced him to let\u2019s leave without making the dangerous creature aware\
  \ of them being nearby \n\nBadal uncle sometimes used to cry thinking of him and\
  \ sing similar songs they used to sing while going to school , back then majorly\
  \ punjabi and Urdu mix . Even though we used to fairly understand the meaning of\
  \ it but what he called it was pure love of bonding . Sometimes when Badal uncle\
  \ used to be in a very good mood he made us have jalebis ( Indian sweet meat ) and\
  \ explain us how satpal once burnt his hand by being too close to the pan . \nHis\
  \ stories used to come in my dreams sometimes the streets of Lahore and Badal and\
  \ Satpal as kids \nLately when we visited Amritsar after years we couldn\u2019t\
  \ get in touch with Badal uncle to only been unfortunately notified that he was\
  \ no more by his family ,emotionelly drained I just narrated out a few of our travel\
  \ storties to his wife of his treats and smiling face ,and his young days with Satpal\
  \ , to which she stopped me and sobbed , satpal was her infant son who died when\
  \ they were leaving from Pakistan in the middle of partition at midnight , Badal\
  \ could never get out of that grief and saw his dead son in you\u2019ll all the\
  \ time ."
