Text: "The Wild Side West is one of the elder queer bars on the West Coast, having\
  \ relocated three times, it has been at its current location since 1976, longer\
  \ than I have been alive, though it was established in 1962. I visited this lovely\
  \ bar last fall, as part of a weekend trip to California, having added it to the\
  \ list of possible destinations on a whim. \n\nThe drive from the Castro to Bernal\
  \ Heights was meandering but beautiful. I admired the famous Painted Ladies of San\
  \ Francisco as the Uber took me to an unassuming street, to what looked like a house.\
  \ As they drove, I was struck by how the eccentric style of the buildings made me\
  \ crave the authenticity I would find at the Wild Side West. \n\nThe bar was quiet\
  \ when I arrived, just a few patrons lining the bar while a game of pool took over\
  \ the main room. The red-painted walls were lined with what seemed like a thousand\
  \ unique pieces, some of them lit, some indiscernible until one was standing just\
  \ in front of them. Wandering outside, a beautiful garden filled with a homey, eclectic\
  \ mix of sculptures and lush plants seemed to welcome me.\n\nOver the course of\
  \ several hours and over a few beers, I met woman that has been coming to the bar\
  \ for a dozen years or more. She told me about moving to California and her work\
  \ as a trainer, and how she had advanced in her company over the years.\n\nAs the\
  \ afternoon turned to night, I met more regulars, their neighbors, a couple that\
  \ had been delivered to the Wild Side West by a search on Google Maps. They stayed\
  \ and chatted for a few minutes, their colognes mixing into the air before leaving.\
  \ At times, the juke-box blared behind us, and sometimes strangers would break into\
  \ song for a few lines, breaking their conversation momentarily. A local guy stopped\
  \ by for a beer, bantering with the bartenders in what was clearly a routine. \n\
  \nThe bar\u2019s history of inclusivity and community was evident everywhere I looked,\
  \ from the decorations lining the walls and the chandelier illuminating the bar\
  \ to the art  lining the bathrooms. The echoes of people being just how they are\
  \ were everywhere, some of their visits brief, some of them ongoing for years. \n\
  \nMy short visit to the WSW reminded me that authenticity can be more important\
  \ than neatness. Everyone needs a place to relax and be and that a neighborhood\
  \ bar is made more wonderful by its eclectic mix of customers. Though I expected\
  \ to find a place that felt foreign, I found a wonderfully dim, neighborhood bar\
  \ waiting to become familiar, crowded with ever-changing art, community events,\
  \ lovely people and good conversation."
