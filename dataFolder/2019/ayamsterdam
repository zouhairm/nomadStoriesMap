Text: "There I am, again, 10 years later, for a trip into the unknown. My innerself\
  \ unknown in the Netherlands, in what I called Ayamsterdam or Amsterdam or A'dam,\
  \ if you are a local. \n\nI went on a trip from Dublin to meet my former host family.\
  \ But where I ended up was a journey meeting my inner aliens. \n\nIt feels amazing,\
  \ when you don't plan much and ended up having an amazing experience. I finally\
  \ met the Mother of all Medicinal plants.\n\nI met mother Ayahuasca. Sure, there\
  \ are stories about it everywhere from the craziest thing to... the craziest ones.\
  \ No. There is no midterm. I ended up sleeping 2 nights in a row , within a gym\
  \ in a beautiful area outside Amsterdam. \n\nMy trip was within and no less beautiful.\
  \ As I knew already Amsterdam, I was there to meet old friends and they invited\
  \ me for the journey and I accepted with no doubts. Of course this took me a little\
  \ planning before going there and some care with my diet.\n\nWe shared some Sananga,\
  \ which is a medicine for your vision but also, makes you have better insights of\
  \ your visions while on Ayahuasca or Yag\xE9. We also shared Rap\xE9, which is a\
  \ powerful medicine, that only a Shaman can sniff into your nose. We also shared\
  \ the food we brough with us.  \n\nIt was all very new to me and I thought with\
  \ myself what is that all about. Sniffs, I was feeling like as If I was doing drugs\
  \ but I was never on drugs. I go to the gym 24/7 and now Im doing drops that hurts\
  \ your eyes, sniffing some powder, but then, after all the ritual preparation I\
  \ met her. \n\nLuckily she humbled me in such a way I will never be able to describe.\
  \ From seeing unbeleivable colors, purging my guts, seeing galaxies, to devils and\
  \ his guides with my eyes open, eyes bright open, and understanding the meaning\
  \ of Unconditional Love through all the anecdotes served through Aya. \n\nI understood\
  \ that life is much more than what we see in front of our eyes and what 3000 years\
  \ of egyptian history was, through connecting with ancient tribal languages from\
  \ Egypt during one of the experiences..\n\nSharing medicine, sharing the food, sharing\
  \ what we had, sharing Love and leave feeling accomplished to show the world what\
  \ kind of journey I am about, this is what I am here for. To write, to show what\
  \ is the medicine for. To let everyone know that they can, if they really want to\
  \ and their journeys outside will be as beautiful as inside."
