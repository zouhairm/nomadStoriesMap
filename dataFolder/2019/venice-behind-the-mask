Text: "The Floating City enchants from every angle, attracting millions of people\
  \ across the world in their desire to experience 'la dolce vita'. Flooding the piazzas,\
  \ backstreets and bars, selfie-sticks in one hand and dripping gelato cones in the\
  \ other, straining their necks to get a glimpse of Ponte di Rialto or standing in\
  \ line to see the view from Campanile di San Marco. \n\nThe real beauty of Venice\
  \ is lost\u2026 lost beneath the cameras, the canals and the crowds. 'La dolce vita'\
  \ so desperately sought is found only by those who no longer chase it. Stray from\
  \ the masses, leave maps and cameras behind and turn off the phone, losing the way\
  \ through unlit alleys of the old town. Allow the twists and turns of cobbled side-streets\
  \ to guide further and further away from the music, the souvenir shops and the insistent\
  \ waiters that thrust menus forward, strewn with blurred pictures of Spaghetti alla\
  \ Carbonara. \n\nIt is dusk; the cruise ships have departed and the sky turns a\
  \ faint lilac-pink, which serves as a fitting backdrop for the young couple sipping\
  \ Aperol, falling deeper in love. The streets become quieter, filled only with the\
  \ sound of waves splashing up against the sides of worn houses and the off-key whistles\
  \ of a woman as she collects her washing from a balcony line. \n\nTaking this turn\
  \ and that, following the path unknown until stumbling across an old bar where a\
  \ tired, olive-skinned man stands at the doorway, lighting a cigarette as he watches\
  \ no one walk by. He brushes his shirt-sleeve across his forehead and offers a wide,\
  \ coffee-stained smile. Setting foot inside, bottles of liquor line the walls, tentatively\
  \ resting upon rusty cabinets. The barman winks playfully, sliding a single espresso\
  \ across the counter.\n\nIt grows darker outside, and amidst ancient bridges and\
  \ weathered shutters the subtle echo of solitary footsteps is interrupted as laughter\
  \ and chanting fills the air. It is here, reaching the end of a dark, narrow passage,\
  \ where a Campo gingerly reveals itself and Venice comes to life.  \n\nHere, you\
  \ will not find giddy tourists tripping up on each-others toes, nor will you come\
  \ across the yawning men in striped t-shirts that perch upon glossy gondolas. Here,\
  \ street-vendors selling sailing hats are nowhere to be seen and sleepy love songs\
  \ played by violinists in frayed tuxedos cannot be heard. \n\nRather, dim streetlights\
  \ expose tables packed with locals picking at Cicchetti, sipping on cold beer, ordering\
  \ another bottle of 'vino bianco della casa'. The real beauty of Venice lies far\
  \ from the crowd, away from the fabricated, magical madness of Piazza San Marco\
  \ and at the heart of this modest square. Where waiters shout across to adjacent\
  \ bars in teasing tones and students smoke like chimneys, popping open bottles of\
  \ prosecco and flinging laurel wreath\u2019s up into the hazy sky in celebration.\
  \ Where children with sun-kissed cheeks spiral every which way, taking turns racing\
  \ bicycles around dozy grandparents who watch on from dark-green benches scattered\
  \ about. It seems as though everyone knows each other\u2026 a private party, open\
  \ to all. \n\n'La dolce vita' is not found where crowded restaurants line the canals,\
  \ where litter spills onto the streets and roses lay trampled on the ground. It\
  \ is found, instead, in the expressions upon Venetian faces as old men salute young\
  \ graduates and sons fetch focaccia for their fathers. It is found where the woman\
  \ who runs the local Pasticceria wishes the priest a good evening on his walk home,\
  \ and the young girl from the corner shop blushes as the boy she likes looks her\
  \ way once again.\n\nPerhaps it is better this way, that only those who happen upon\
  \ it by chance have the pleasure of seeing Venice for what it really is, behind\
  \ the mask. It is better this way, so the charming, intimate sense of community\
  \ that still remains can live on, unobserved, in spite of its surroundings.\n\n\
  In an ideal world where 'no grandi navi' reach Venice, unscarred by the power of\
  \ money, image and greed, the Venetians rise up, sitting once again in the local\
  \ bar, watching no one walk by. This island of water is not a theme park, it\u2019\
  s a home."
