Text: "As I zipped the bag, the feeling of true dread waved throughout my entirety.\
  \  I have absolutely no idea what I am going to do, but my soul is rattling, taking\
  \ total control over my mind.  This is it and nothing is stopping me from being\
  \ where I'm meant to be. \n    It isn't every day the universe flows from chaos\
  \ to utter certainty.  As my footsteps echoed throughout the stairwell, my heart\
  \ swells with adrenaline.  All ego vanished and it's now replaced by a yearning\
  \ for understanding and love.  My attention deficit all of a sudden is cured!  \n\
  \    Usually, a spontaneous journey halfway across the country would have been daunting,\
  \ is now merely annoying.  Keys, gas, and my nerves... check.  Adjust rearview and\
  \ side mirrors as I bring the seatbelt to the buckle.  All the time this every day\
  \ redundant motion is happening, my life is forever altering simultaneously.  Unlike\
  \ every trip before, this is the complete shift in my existence altogether.  As\
  \ the key turns and the engine comes to life, I draw in the deepest of breathes.\
  \  I exhale and draw the gears into reverse but before I release the brake I feel\
  \ my life's problems disappear.  Until this moment I had no idea of what my purpose\
  \ in this world is.  As my foot releases and the vehicle rolls into the lane my\
  \ searching is over.  Without hesitation I accelerate forward, on my way to meet\
  \ my newborn son.   Just getting started."
