Text: "When me and my friends bought a return ticket to Phuket (HKT) in 2011, little\
  \ did we expect that life will never be the same ever since. Initially we'll be\
  \ travelling by four, in the last minute two friends cancelled out leaving me and\
  \ another friend named Aga. Flight from our hometown Jakarta (CGK) to HKT about\
  \ one-third seat are empty, so during taxi so many passenger are changing seats\
  \ including Aga, who initially seat beside an appealing girl. When we are landed\
  \ in HKT, we clearly don't know where to go, we didn't book hotel and don't know\
  \ how to activate a cellular data for smartphone since this is my first trip abroad\
  \ using a popular smartphone back then, a Blackberry Javelin. Out of sudden, we\
  \ met that girl again now with her friend that they are travelling with two other\
  \ friends. While they are setting their smartphone, they also ask if we are going\
  \ to Patong ? i replied \"maybe\" because i really have no idea about this place.\
  \ They also told us that there's a counter if we want to buy Thai SIM Card. As i\
  \ approach the counter, i found it very crowded so i just told Aga that we should\
  \ of get out of this airport and lets get lost, literally.\n\nAs we walk out the\
  \ airport, so many people offering hotel and airport transfer. I have no idea about\
  \ this, until somebody asks \"Are you going to Patong ?\" i just said yes, so we\
  \ visit his counter and book a hotel and buy a van ticket to the hotel. On the way\
  \ from HKT, to be honest we are very surprised and found that this place are not\
  \ so interesting, until we are approaching Patong area, especially Bangla Road.\
  \ I told Aga, this is awesome mate.\n\nWe spent 5 days doing what other tourist\
  \ do, shopping, bar hoping, sunbathing, and took a day trip to James Bond Island.\
  \ Just an ordinary story that I convinced you have heard, read or watch in YouTube\
  \ about \"Traveling to Phuket\" \n\nWell, my story actually started when we are\
  \ about to go home. In HKT airport we met those girls again, by now a full team\
  \ of 4 girls all wearing a same shirt. We exchange stories about our journey and\
  \ get on board. When we are landed in CGK finally i can activate my BlackBerry again\
  \ so we exchange BBM Pin with those girls. We told our other friends that we don't\
  \ bring much souvenirs because we don't bring much cash, I don't have credit card\
  \ and i don't know that Visa ATM card can be used to withdraw money anywhere in\
  \ the world, instead we bring much more, we made a new friendship with four girls\
  \ about the same age with us and at that point, all of them are bachelorette.  \n\
  \nAfter this we like to hanging out together, we introduce our other friends in\
  \ Jakarta. Me and Aga, plus those 4 girls are not 6, but more than that, even more\
  \ than 15 ! Every time we met, there's got to be some one new being introduced.\
  \ However as the time goes by, we cannot always be together and inseparable all\
  \ the time. People come and go, and somebody are getting married or moving out from\
  \ Jakarta. Well, its a natural process so nothing to be worried about it.\n\nHowever\
  \ for me on a personal level, I've got introduced to 2 person among them. One of\
  \ them turns into my Business Partner, as i place some investment in his existing\
  \ business. The other one even much better, I was introduced to a girl that later\
  \ become my wife :))))\n\nWe got married in January 2015, and later going on honeymoon\
  \ to a place no other than Phuket. As of this February 2019, we already have a 3\
  \ years old son.\n\nI won't be surprised if you have heard about someone met his/her\
  \ significant others because of travelling, but i'm glad to become one of them.\n\
  \nEven better if this story can make me win this competition\n\nThanks and Best\
  \ Regards,\n\n\nAkbar Pasha"
