Text: "Where the galaxies live: Summer in the Amalfi Coast \n\nThis summer, I\u2019\
  ve chosen to dive into the searing heat and suffocating crowds of the Amalfi Coast\
  \ in the middle of August with my family in tow. Together, we face the glittering\
  \ seas\u2014and the occasional jellyfish\u2014for a classic Italian experience with\
  \ some added flavour. \nWe start in Naples: Gateway to the Amalfi Coast and the\
  \ city that welcomes restauranteurs from far and wide, but we don\u2019t stay here\
  \ for long. Four million people visit Italy\u2019s pristine coastline per year and\
  \ half of those people arrive in the summer months, so we quickly trade these congested\
  \ streets for the sea and book a charter boat down to Cetara. \nThe coastal breeze\
  \ that surrounds us on board is a welcome reprieve from the heat of the mainland,\
  \ and the champagne we sip glistens like the seas we move through on our way down\
  \ the coastline. Like most Italian summers, the air is dry and the sun is unforgiving.\
  \ But the cliff-side villages we pass boast a vibrancy of earthy reds and sun-kissed\
  \ rooves that distract us from the heat. \nIt\u2019s our first chartered cruise\
  \ with the Plaghia Charter group, a company that boasts \u2018unmatched personal\
  \ service\u2019 with a luxury that will make you feel like \u2018Grace Kelly of\
  \ Monaco\u2019. I stand next to our captain, Romero, as he steers the boat with\
  \ one foot. He wanted to free up his hands so that he could search through his phone\
  \ for a photo he has to show me. Matthew McConaughey was on his boat last week,\
  \ he tells us, brandishing the photo on his phone as evidence. There\u2019s a spot\
  \ underneath Cetara that he\u2019s going to take us to, one that McConaughey apparently\
  \ loved. Loosely translated, he describes this McConaughey-approved cave system\
  \ as a place where \u2018the galaxies live\u2019. \nWe have a healthy amount of\
  \ cynicism shrouding our expectations as we drop anchor underneath the limestone\
  \ cliffs of Cetara. After all, it seems unlikely that a place along the Amalfi coast\
  \ would remain a secret for very long when the piercing gaze of hungry tourists\
  \ like us crowd every cave, inlet, or secret \u2018spot\u2019. But as I dive into\
  \ the clear water and swim underneath a limestone archway still glistening with\
  \ damp green moss, my doubts are immediately dashed. \n\nI suddenly understand Romero\u2019\
  s description. On the roof of the cave there are iridescent patterns that dance\
  \ in glowing blues and whites. The damp moss on the limestone captures the sky-blue\
  \ reflection of the water and throws it in curving lines of light on the cave walls.\
  \ It\u2019s as if the aurora borealis has swum through the clear waters of the Mediterranean\
  \ and been captured by this space. \nWe float underneath these luminescent patterns\
  \ for almost half an hour, transfixed by this seemingly personal lightshow before\
  \ my sister suddenly cries out in pain. There are hundreds of jellyfish around us,\
  \ brought in by the changing tide. In their transparent bulbs they contain their\
  \ own little flickering luminescence, but in their tentacles, they carry a sting\
  \ that forces us quickly out of the mouth of the cave and back into the Italian\
  \ sun. Romero laughs, and we laugh too, bearing the small red marks of what he calls\
  \ \u2018jelly kisses\u2019. It\u2019s their breeding ground, he tells us, as we\
  \ rub aloe vera on each mark. \nApparently, Matthew McConaughey is somewhere now\
  \ with his own red marks and a story of a place beneath Cetara where galaxies live\
  \ on the roof of a limestone cave."
