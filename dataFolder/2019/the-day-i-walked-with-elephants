Text: "Doesn't it happen to you that sometimes you look at your travel photographs\
  \ and cannot believe you were there? It still amazes me feeling so strange and intimate\
  \ with all the places I visited, with every experience I lived. Thailand provided\
  \ me with memories I retell today as if they were an everyday activity, when in\
  \ fact, they were extraordinary, so far away from my daily routine, so  wonderful,\
  \ oneiric, that when I recall them I cannot help feeling moved by them.\nIn Chiang\
  \ Mai, 700km North of Bangkok, I had the pleasure of visiting an elephant park.\
  \ I had read a lot about them, about the different places where you were allowed\
  \ to ride them. But I did not entirely like this idea. I knew that most of these\
  \ places worked with shows and in order for the animals to \u201Cperform\u201D,\
  \ they were brutally abused. Until I heard about a place that rescued and rehabilitated\
  \ elephants, so I began to convince myself. No separating them from theirs mothers,\
  \ no locking them down, no chains, no \u201Cbreaking their spirit\u201D, but exactly\
  \ the opposite. \nI looked for several options: volunteer work? Dedicate  three\
  \ days to these animals? Do  I love them that much?  Pamper baby elephants? No,\
  \ definitely not babies. I decided to spend one day feeding and bathing elephants.\
  \ No more and no less. \nThe day started  quickly, like  ripping off a band-aid.\
  \ As soon as the group I went with arrived, we were brought closer to an elephant\
  \ and given a bag with fruit and sugar canes. The park guides  made gestures so\
  \ we would start feeding them. Already? I thought. Without introductions? In fact,\
  \ we have been introduced, but what with accents and astonishment to see them so\
  \ closely, I missed the whole thing out. One second you are on the bus, the next,\
  \ you are feeding an elephant that slaps you with its trunk. No time to get used\
  \ to. \nWe were explained that we would feed them along a path and that we should\
  \ frequently do it so that they could follow us until the river where they would\
  \ bathe themselves. And so I did. A bit scared at first, but then I started to play\
  \ and pet them until that moment when you realise that the path is narrow, the group\
  \ walks slowly ahead of you and you have an elephant behind you that does not stop.\
  \ You learn that selfies are beautiful, but  that is not the reason why you are\
  \ there; you are there to take care of them, as long as they  want you to. You are\
  \ at their service and not the other way around. You chose a tour that requires\
  \ responsibility. \nWe had luch and after a while, the guides sent us to the river.\
  \ The elephants appeared slowly from the corners. They came towards us, a small\
  \  group of tourists excited and a bit terrifed  at the same time.  I approached\
  \ them with caution. Which one was my elephant?, I thought.  The one that walked\
  \ with me? It did not matter anymore. I just let it splash me and I did the same.\n\
  We played along, all of us. This is one of the most extravagant and, at the same\
  \ time, one of the simplest memories that I posess of all my journeys. In the end,\
  \ we were all children. Different ages, different species splashing ourselves. \
  \ Some animals threw themselves to the mud while the branches of the trees nearby,\
  \ crunched under their weight, reminding us that we were guests in their home. And\
  \ then just as they came, they left. No warning, leaving me, I must say, feeling\
  \ abandoned.\nI still recall vividly walking at their side while the guide explained\
  \ the stories of every animal in the park, when a cry from a mommy elephant broke\
  \ the surroundings . I remember that cry that concentrated so much; the fear, the\
  \ concern, and the very small place that we have in the wild nature. Whenever someone\
  \ asks me about Thailand I tell them this story, and I urge them to spend a day\
  \ walking with these lovely animals."
