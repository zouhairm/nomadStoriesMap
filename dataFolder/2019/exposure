Text: "Coming back to the place where you nearly died is everything but easy. We arrive\
  \ at the remote village in southern Vietnam late in the evening, as the suffocating\
  \ heat has melted away and the air is warm and breathable. The restaurants and bars\
  \ offer entertainment, we can hear laughter and cheerful voices. But, we are no\
  \ ordinary tourists. We are here on a mission.  \n\nI have come back to claim something\
  \ I left, to gain back my confidence. Trapped in the day that made me face my mortality,\
  \ I\u2019ve been running amok for the past four years. Being unable not to travel,\
  \ and yet not capable of staying in one place, I took refuge in European cities,\
  \ soaked in their history, I hiked in the lowlands and forests. I even learned to\
  \ climb. Everything and everywhere to be away from the water. I feared the sea and\
  \ the ocean, the very sound of them made my heart go tap-dancing, and my hands shake\
  \ uncontrollably, I once had a panic attack in the movie theatre \u2013 there was\
  \ a plane lending on a river on the screen. It was our second date with my fianc\xE9\
  , and he bought the tickets.   \n\nSurprisingly, he stayed through all of this by\
  \ my side and eventually persuaded me to start therapy. This trip is the final part\
  \ of my treatment. And I am going to live.  \n\nThe morning I nearly drowned, I\
  \ was windsurfing alone far away from the shore. Together with a group of water\
  \ sports lovers I had come to Vietnam for a short vacation in April, right before\
  \ the mon-soon season.  \n\nThat day, blinded by my confidence, I stayed in the\
  \ water long after the more skilled and experienced have left. I was waiting for\
  \ \u201Cthe real wind\u201D to come. And it did come. It turned my board upside\
  \ down with the mast knocking me on the head. I can remember everything that happened\
  \ next so precisely as my nightmares won\u2019t let me forget the smallest detail.\n\
  \nAs I managed to swim from under the sail, blood oozed from the wound on my forehead\
  \ and blocked my vision. Caught up in the waves and unable to cling to the drifting\
  \ away board, I began to panic, my brain was no longer functioning and the only\
  \ clear thought I had was:  \u201CThis is it. This is how I am going to die\u201D\
  .  \n\nI made a desperate attempt to swim to the shore, each stroke taking away\
  \ the remaining strength. I gasped for air, swallowing water and blood,  I can still\
  \ feel the salty and sugary tastes in my mouth. I was starting to feel that I could\
  \ no longer stay afloat when some strong hands lifted me up and onto a boat \u2013\
  \ someone on the shore saw me and alerted the lifeguards.   \n\nFour years later\
  \ I am back. The next day after the arrival I get up early. My fianc\xE9 is asleep\
  \ and I don\u2019t wake him up as I have promised to. Technically, I am not supposed\
  \ to be doing this alone, but I want no back up.  It is about six, as put on my\
  \ swimming suit and step out of the house. The sun is begin-ning to rise: red, yellow\
  \ and pink paints are thrown carelessly and yet with precision onto the light blue\
  \ canvas coming miraculously alive with every touch. Quietly as if not to wake the\
  \ entire world, I go to the beach, and freeze one meter before the water. My heart\
  \ starts to beat just a tiny bit faster and I close my eyes.\n\nMy therapist called\
  \ it \u201Cexposure\u201D. We started lightly: with photos of the sea, then moved\
  \ on to listening to the sound of waves, and imagining myself swimming. And now\
  \ it\u2019s real. The sea. I open my eyes and make one more step. I have a choice,\
  \ I can either be afraid for the rest of my life or\u2026  With that I start to\
  \ run, meeting the cold waves on my skin, and plunge into the coolness of water.\
  \ And, as the last touch of the night disappears in the morning light, so does my\
  \ fear."
