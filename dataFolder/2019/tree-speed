Text: "My alarm clock came in waves, the humming call to prayer from the mosque at\
  \ 5:30 am, hungry chickens pecking at my toes, and most enjoyably, the gentle rustle\
  \ from a gibbon gliding through our forests canopy. She was almost as rare as the\
  \ reigning sultans of Malaysia. \n\nI\u2019d heard of the Rainforest Treehouse from\
  \ a local artist I met on the island of Penang. \u201CIt\u2019s a guesthouse for\
  \ people wanting to connect with nature,\u201D she said as we biked the narrow streets\
  \ of Georgetown blending in with murals on the 19th century buildings. So far, Penang\
  \ had left me mystified and I wanted to see more. Mosques, Hindu temples and Taoist\
  \ temples were neighbors on the same block. A buffet of spirituality and artistic\
  \ inspiration. I found it important to pay my respects equally, visiting each church\
  \ and following the ceremonial practices.\n\nI pin balled my way across the peninsula,\
  \ bouncing between bustling cities and natural wonders. On one particular tour in\
  \ the Cameron Highlands, we followed dogs through towering ferns and friendly banana\
  \ trees. We were in a sea of green hunting for a brick red flower with cream colored\
  \ spots. The rest of the group wiped clay from their shins and swatted mosquitoes\
  \ while our guide slathered the mud on as war paint. After several hours, the dogs\
  \ stopped, circling a cluster of banana leaves on the ground. There was no guarantee\
  \ we\u2019d see the flower because of it\u2019s six day bloom cycle. Our guide slowly\
  \ peeled back the leaves to reveal the largest flower in the world, the Rafflesia.\
  \ It turned out to be surprisingly foul smelling and on the verge of extinction.\
  \ \n\nEach site seemed to outmatch the previous, and after months of solo travel\
  \ I craved finding a small community and quite frankly a break from moving every\
  \ couple of days. I found out that the Rainforest Treehouse ran an organic farm\
  \ and needed volunteers. I booked my bus for the next day. \n\nStanding alone, in\
  \ the dark, after a seven hour ride to the southern tip of Johor, I wondered what\
  \ my sister would say if she knew my only defense was a heavy backpack. I was anxious\
  \ and sweaty, waiting for a fellow volunteer to pick me up. Out of a small blue\
  \ car a woman called, \u201CAre you Ashley?\u201D I ditched my bags in the trunk\
  \ and we drove to the closest food carts for dinner. The exotic spread mirrored\
  \ the mix of culture I\u2019d felt in Penang. We had red curry, nasi lemak, eggs\
  \ soaked in red wine, frozen durian and for desert, pigs tongue. I gnawed at the\
  \ muscle and Yen, the volunteer, laughed asking if I\u2019d like to join her mom\
  \ for dance class that evening. Full to the brim with strange food, I found myself\
  \ dancing to Madonna with a group women in their sixties, kernels of fear evaporating\
  \ from my skin. \n\nThe next day we climbed 380 steps to the open, circular community\
  \ of six houses nestled in the trees. Some were 15 feet high, some 30, all were\
  \ rustic. In the center, braided vines led to hammocks where people relaxed, soaking\
  \ in the sounds of the jungle. Yao, the owner, was a monkey himself, scurrying up\
  \ trees as he explained the thoughtful construction of each house. They were unfurnished\
  \ except for mosquito nets, threefold mattress toppers and a fan. Every morning\
  \ we took the guests jungle trekking, picking cinnamon leaves and pointing out beehives\
  \ on the trail. Every evening we made dinner over the fire and shared techniques\
  \ for defending our food from the macaque monkeys. \n\nWe were coming up on the\
  \ fourth of July and while the guests were fascinated that I\u2019d never had anchovies\
  \ with rice for breakfast, I was equally shocked they hadn\u2019t experienced graham\
  \ crackers, marshmallows and melted chocolate. We dangled our toes from the top\
  \ floor of the observation tower watching the fireworks fly over the treetops, celebrating\
  \ both the end of Ramadan and America\u2019s independence. \n\nI drifted to sleep\
  \ that night, suspended in the air, comforted by the sound of the gibbon reminding\
  \ me of the mysterious power of the pace in the trees."
