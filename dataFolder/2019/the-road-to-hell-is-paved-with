Text: "I recall being small and examining the capital\u2019s name on a map. Ashgabat.\
  \ How to make sense of it? My childhood mind, grasping for associations, conjured\
  \ images of smoldering campfires and exotic winged creatures. What to make of the\
  \ \u201Cga,\u201D though... probably the only thing Turkmenistan has in common with\
  \ Georgia. As I grew older and learned how closed and unreachable a country it is,\
  \ my interest was piqued even more. So when a chance job opportunity crossed my\
  \ path in early adulthood, without hesitation I set off to find out firsthand the\
  \ meaning of Ashgabat.\n\nThe Western world knows well North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong\
  \ Un, but a less familiar face is that of his Turkic counterpart: Gurbanguly Berdymuhamedov,\
  \ known in Turkmenistan simply as the turkmenbashy. \u201CHow on earth do you remember\
  \ his name?\u201D Western friends ask. But once you\u2019ve spent any time in Turkmenia,\
  \ it is impossible to NOT have his name and image seared across your consciousness.\
  \ His countenance, which actually hosts a quite benign expression, exemplifies the\
  \ concept of ubiquity in this little-known Central Asian nation. His portrait considers\
  \ me complacently from the wall separating my kind from business class, as our tiny\
  \ airplane touches down in Ashgabat.\n\nMy time in Turkmenistan is limited, and\
  \ the 11:00pm city-wide curfew gives me even less time to explore my new habitat.\
  \ I peer out at the impossibly clean and entirely empty streets from my apartment\
  \ window and ponder my course of action for the coming days. Of priority on my agenda\
  \ is one of the world\u2019s more curious locales \u2013 the Gates of Hell. Rich\
  \ in oil and natural gas, Soviet Turkmenistan played host to many a Russian drilling\
  \ expedition. In 1971 one such undertaking near the village Darvaza punctured a\
  \ cavern of underground gas, which began to leak toxic fumes of distressing proportions.\
  \ The Soviets\u2019 solution? Light it on fire. And it has been burning ever since.\
  \ Most children dream of visiting the Eiffel Tower. But I was always drawn to the\
  \ Gates of Hell in Turkmenistan. I\u2019m afraid this says a lot about me. \n\n\
  The road to Darvaza will take the majority of the day, already a shortened one in\
  \ accordance with the beginning of winter. It starts snowing as we leave Ashgabat,\
  \ huge flakes falling rapidly onto the forms of shaggy camels grazing along the\
  \ road. \u201CCamels are smarter than cows,\u201D Vadim, my driver, tells me matter-of-factly\
  \ as we stop at a gas station. \u201CAnd their milk is more nutritious. I\u2019\
  ll get you a bottle.\u201D And hops out of the Jeep. He quickly returns, but instead\
  \ of the promised camel milk, deposits a Snickers bar in my lap. \"The gas station\
  \ owner\u2019s son didn\u2019t get up early enough to do the milking before school,\"\
  \ Vadim explains apologetically. But I suppose snacking on American sugar is just\
  \ as fitting for my journey to the Gates of Hell. Munching contentedly, I contemplate\
  \ the furry humpbacked beauties along the road, whose long-lashed faces are now\
  \ almost as familiar to me as the Turkmenbashy\u2019s. Soon a smattering of simple\
  \ brick houses comes into view. Darvaza \u2013 announces a road sign \u2013 population\
  \ 350 \u2013 and already visible on the horizon are vivid blazes signaling arrival\
  \ at our destination. \n\nThe fiery pit does not disappoint. As promised, it really\
  \ is an ever-burning chasm in the middle of the desert. I shiver in the dark and\
  \ chilly November evening, as gaseous flames beckon me into an alleged underworld.\
  \ My grasp of geology, chemistry, and whatever other sciences are needed to comprehend\
  \ the workings of this dramatic spectacle are admittedly shaky, and my lack of understanding\
  \ perhaps makes my awe even more profound, the sight even more surreal. In companionable\
  \ silence, Vadim and I gaze into the enormous flaming crater: an experience I certainly\
  \ would never trade for any Eiffel Tower. They say the road to Hell is paved with\
  \ good intentions. Mine was paved with.... camels and Snickers?"
