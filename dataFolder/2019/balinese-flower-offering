Text: "It\u2019s the rainy season in Bali. My clothes are permanently damp from the\
  \ humidity and my consistent stream of sweat. Here in Bali, the beads of sweat that\
  \ drip down your face and back are part of the beautiful land. The torrential downpours,\
  \ that last for days sometimes, ignites both fear and calmness in me. \n\nDayu enters\
  \ the open room that morning with the same innocent smile we had been seeing all\
  \ week. The supplies were neatly organized as she explained we would be making our\
  \ first flower offering. These offerings would be received that afternoon at Pura\
  \ Tirta Empul before the rain. \n\nWe gather around to learn more about Balinese\
  \ Hindu: Red lies in the South representing fire and the Brahma god. Purple or blue\
  \ symbolizes water in the North with the Wisnu god. The East corner represents the\
  \ Iswara god with pink or white. The East is for wind. The Mahaclewa god comes from\
  \ the west with yellow or orange colors to represent the earth. Lastly, the god\
  \ in the middle, Siwa, represents balance with green. \n\nI struggle with the calmness\
  \ I have seen in the Balinese people as they create numerous of these flower offerings\
  \ everyday. There are no staples, tape, or glue. Only indigenous plants that have\
  \ been used for hundreds of years by the Balinese people to assemble their delicate\
  \ offerings to their God. \n\nThe speed we travel towards Pura Tirta Empul makes\
  \ me have to swallow back my urge to vomit as my body moves back and forth with\
  \ the van\u2019s motion. Roads here are narrow and windy with an expression of organized\
  \ chaos, at least to my USA standards where organization is everything. Envy builds\
  \ inside of me as I experience more of Bali and its people. How they can show such\
  \ balance in their daily life is truly something I want to emulate in my life \n\
  \nAs I climb out of the van after the half-hour journey, we are again greeted by\
  \ Dayu\u2019s smile. She shows us how to correctly tie a sarong for the temple.\
  \ My sarong was purchased a few days before in the hectic Ubud market where haggling\
  \ is a must. All men, women, and children must wear a sarong to enter the sacred\
  \ temple for worship.  \n\nOur authentic sarongs cover our bodies as we prepare\
  \ to enter the holy water with our hand made flower offering. There are three pools\
  \ filled with crystal clear, holy water that comes from a local river. Each pool\
  \ has a certain number of water spouts with each spout representing something different\
  \ to the Balinese people. \n\nApproaching the first spout in the first pool, I feel\
  \ a sense of ease. Something I have not felt since I have been in Bali. I finally\
  \ feel calm and can try to understand where the Balinese people gain their calmness.\
  \ I bow my head at the first spout, holding my flower offering, and I make a prayer.\
  \ As someone who is not Hindu, I did not want to seem insensitive to their religion.\
  \ But this time, at this moment, I felt a connection to a religion, people, and\
  \ something bigger than myself. For once I could understand the reason for extensive\
  \ devotion to something beyond me. \n\nI place my flower offering above the spout\
  \ with all the other beautiful offerings that people have made to give to their\
  \ higher spirit that day. As my prayer left my thoughts, I splash my face three\
  \ times with the ice cold water followed by dunking my head into the water three\
  \ more times for completion of the ceremony. At almost every spout in every pool,\
  \ I share my prayer to whatever higher power is listening in hopes for some answers.\
  \ At that moment I realize what the Balinese people already know, the answers are\
  \ from within and we are all connected no matter what side of the planet we live\
  \ on. The Balinese people taught me to go forth with kindness and calmness to all\
  \ living creatures."
