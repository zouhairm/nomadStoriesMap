Text: "In the year prior to walking through the blue tiled gates of old Fez, I had\
  \ lived through approximately 6,720 Epileptic seizures. I had reached the outer\
  \ limits of Western medicines ability to help me and was informed by multiple medical\
  \ experts that I should \u201Cgo home to get my affairs in order\u201D. Simply put,\
  \ thousands of seizures has \u201Cnegative consequences\u201D on ones heart. International\
  \ travel was considered a pipe dream, rooted in a baseless hope and a slightly pollyanna-ish\
  \ world view of what was otherwise considered impossible. \n\nSo when I heard that\
  \ 9000-9500 allys and streets, that constitute old Fez were \u201Cimpossible\u201D\
  \ to navigate without a guide, I had a very different relationship to the word than\
  \ potentially was wise. \n\nSuccessfully locating the temporary apartment my travel\
  \ partner and I had secured for the next few days, revealed that we were at the\
  \ \u201Ctop of the market\u201D. I therefor only had remember to walk \u201Cup\u201D\
  \ any one of the 9000 streets in order to get \u2018home\u2019 safely. I was dirty,\
  \ grumpy and still smelled like the sheep underneath the bus I had taken two days\
  \ earlier. I was in desperate need of some solo time. Armed with a casual intention\
  \ to find a traditional Hammam, I headed out to wander, and watch the world go by.\
  \ \n\nStepping out into the midday sunshine my nose quickly filled with dusty red\
  \ earth, and the smell of donkeys pulling coca-cola carts. This was followed closely\
  \ by diesel spewing car fumes. After a few moments of observing a beehive like humm\
  \ of humans to car, to width of populated road ratios, I decided to hug the sides\
  \ of the market stalls out of curiosity and a well developed survival instinct nonetheless.\n\
  \ \nI felt myself flexing new found traveller muscles that a few short months ago\
  \ had seemed all but impossible. Slightly nauseous from excitement, I walked into\
  \ my very first solo travel time. Feeling the crunch of the pebbles beneath my feet\
  \ and the smell of soup prepping itself for the evening meal a few hours off, I\
  \ leaned into my delight. My first few steps into the pleasures of solo travel and\
  \ my cheeks were instantly flushed with the crimson color\u2019s of growing confidence\
  \ in my body. This feeling was no small feat and it had arrived with a few small\
  \ steps into the ancient ally ways of this souk.  \n\nAs I walked I checked out\
  \ the contrarian products in the stalls, tall, thigh high 8inch heeled boots, next\
  \ to the Koran\u2019s, and Holy stories for children. Turning a few unplanned corners\
  \ I found a groove of following my feelings more than the map I had purposefully\
  \ left tucked into my bag. I noticed I was yet again, the only woman I could see\
  \ for quite some distance, not an uncommon experience for me at this point, but\
  \ I wondered where they all were. \n\nThat was around the time I found myself in\
  \ front of a hole in the wall Hammam and realized that these were the women\u2019\
  s bathing hours. \n\nFeeling the ache of three weeks of bus travel in my body, I\
  \ took a deep breath not really knowing what to expect, and walked into a completely\
  \ foreign world. \n\nI took off my shoes, and was stunned to realize I was completely\
  \ out of my comfort zone. My mind lurched and stumbled trying to bring subterranean\
  \ beliefs and the belly laughing bodies of Arab women all around me. Folding my\
  \ clothes and shifting my eyes towards the door, I saw a woman in full Burka walk\
  \ into the room. I watched as she bent over, grabbed the bottom of her Burka and\
  \ whipped it up over her head. She began orating accrose the room with the passion\
  \ of filibustering politician. As she turned to walk away, I noticed the word \u201C\
  flirt\u201D written across the butt of her underwear. It was in that exact moment\
  \ that heard a lifetime of asinine assumptions shatter like fragile glass inside\
  \ my mind. Stunned but smiling, I chuckled at myself, lifted my chin, grabbed my\
  \ bucket and stepped into a white steamy room filled with mystery and a growing\
  \ sense of freedom."
