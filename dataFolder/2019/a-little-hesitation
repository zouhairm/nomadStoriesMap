Text: "You close your eyes and clench your teeth. The chilling realisation dawns on\
  \ you that you\u2019ve finally reached the point in your life where you would learn\
  \ to break free- even if it were just for a little bit. You look to the left and\
  \ find your sister grinning at you like the absolute maniac she is. \u201CReady?\u201D\
  \ she asks and you nod in confirmation. She doesn't hesitate in the slightest before\
  \ ecstatically jumping into the depths of tartarus- as it seemed to you. You watch\
  \ as she resurfaces up ahead of your yacht- frantically motioning for you to jump\
  \ in. This is it, you think, and jump into the Andaman sea. \n\nNow, it wasn\u2019\
  t as if you were doing this against your will- or that you had come here out of\
  \ a strong need to do something that was too crazy. You were here because you wanted\
  \ to do it, you needed to do it- you had to do it. Just because. Sure, you were\
  \ a little jittery for lack of any swimming experience, but that wouldn\u2019t stop\
  \ you today.\n\nThe first gush of water against your skin succumbs you entirely,\
  \ leaving you paralysed for a few seconds. You sink a little as your eyes take in\
  \ the image of the all- encompassing ocean. When you resurface, you look up to the\
  \ sky and realise that all you want to do now is explore the depths within. Gushing\
  \ in as much air as your lungs could hold, you dive in again and start swimming\
  \ around. Looking down is of no use- all you see is the bluish green of the water\
  \ and a large black void. You have no sense of depth or dimension- the void could\
  \ be a couple of meters, or miles away. \n\nThe training instructor soon enters\
  \ the water and brings the two of you to him. Having confirmed all the signs, he\
  \ shoots a thumbs up at the yacht rider and looks at the two of you. \u201CReady?\u201D\
  \ he asked, and you reply in unison, \u201CYes!\u201D before plunging into the waters.\
  \ \n\n\u201CSurreal\u201D is one word to describe the feeling. \u201CEthereal\u201D\
  \ is another one. But in reality, the experience was simply sublime. As you go deeper,\
  \ you find yourself becoming one with the ocean, as if you belong. It felt so effortless\
  \ that you don\u2019t realise when the scenario shifted from plain blue to hints\
  \ of green, red and yellow. The corals appear, bringing with them life that emerges\
  \ from all around you. Your eyes widen in apprehension, as a swarm of beautiful\
  \ golden blue fish pass you to the right. You look up ahead to find your sister\
  \ trying to reach out to a blowfish, only to find that it has ballooned up and spiralled\
  \ into the corals. You chuckle and look downward, managing to catch a glimpse of\
  \ a water snake rustle into the rock formations. \n\nYou remember the packet that\
  \ you had sneaked into your airtight suit pocket earlier, and remove from it a fistful\
  \ of bread crumbs. You hold your hands out, and suddenly, all around you have gathered\
  \ colourful fish and sea horses, nibbling at the floating crumbs before they turn\
  \ soggy. You try to frame this memory forever; taking in the throbbing fish, their\
  \ little tails, their myriad forms and vibrant colours. It had hardly been seconds\
  \ before the bread crumbs vanish into thin air and the fish meander away, though\
  \ the moments felt to you like forever. \n\nThe instructor lets you saunter around\
  \ the corals for a little while longer, before motioning to you the hand signal\
  \ that indicated that you begin your ascent. There is a buzz in your heart that\
  \ helps you ignore the pain you feel in your ears as you ascend through pressure\
  \ differences.\n\nYou resurface about two hours later, and immediately plunge back\
  \ in for one last glance. A last goodbye to the ocean that has shown you your place\
  \ in the vast universe."
