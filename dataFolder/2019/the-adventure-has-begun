Text: "My entire existence on earth has been confined to a place I like to call \u201C\
  the blackhole of Canada\u201D which the outside world deems as Saskatchewan. I call\
  \ it this because it seems many people want to leave, however, whenever they try\
  \ to escape it\u2019s vast emptiness, they are hopelessly vacuumed back into it\u2019\
  s antagonizing suction, doomed to walk alongside the looming sheaves of wheat for\
  \ all of time.\PGrowing up I was unable to travel much as my mother was a young\
  \ single mom, living on her own, also in university. We didn\u2019t have much change\
  \ to spare for leisurely travel. Being restricted to a singular environment where\
  \ the scenery is bland and quite non existent really has influenced me to crave\
  \ adventure elsewhere. I had always dreamed up the idea of moving away to travel\
  \ the globe but actually taking the necessary steps for venturing out in the unknown\
  \ terrified me to the bones. Until I did it.\PNearly nine months ago I adventured\
  \ to Toronto for a music festival. While in Ontario my soul came to life after becoming\
  \ stagnant and jailed for what seemed an eternity. This time completely changed\
  \ my life. It was then I knew where the next chapter of my life needed to be written.\P\
  As fate played it\u2019s cards it granted me the opportunity to move to Ontario\
  \ three short months later. It was off a whim. My original plan had been to work\
  \ while saving up money to make the big move. That is not what happened. Not even\
  \ close. I had just been fired from a job, and had only a measly thousand dollars\
  \ in the bank; my life was looking grim. I was in a place of having lost all hope\
  \ of fulfilling my dream of making the great escape when my friend, whom I had met\
  \ at the festival in Toronto, told me she had just bought a house. She then proceeded\
  \ to invite me to live with her. I jumped on the offer without hesitation. I bought\
  \ a one way ticket to Toronto that night. Three weeks later I left everything I\
  \ had ever known behind, besides whatever I could jam into two suitcases. I stepped\
  \ aboard that plane ready with anticipation for adventure to unroll itself at my\
  \ feet. It was me against the world. Nothing has ever felt as empowering as that\
  \ moment did. Against all the odds I was able to make my dream come true. That\u2019\
  s how I now know I can do anything I set my mind to."
