Text: "After an hour and a half train ride I arrived to the station of Aguas Calientes,\
  \ It\u2019s very early and it\u2019s still very cold in the valley but all of that\
  \ doesn\u2019t matter because my excitement surpassed any type of obstacle that\
  \ the weather could provide. After a slow bus ride from Aguas Calientes to Machu\
  \ Picchu we finally arrived and it was breathtaking. The cold weather, the long\
  \ journey and the mountain sickness is forgotten as soon as you step into the ancient\
  \ archeological complex.\n\nArriving and all of the sudden discover that mystical\
  \ city built at the top of the mountain isn\u2019t quite comparable to anything\
  \ you could possibly imagine. As you begin your journey to Machu Picchu you see\
  \ birds and flora that make you feel like you are transcending into another dimension\
  \ and, if you are lucky enough, you\u2019ll see the fog that gathers around the\
  \ mountain for a more magical sensation.\n\nThere, in Machu Picchu, watching the\
  \ sky through a window of the Temple of the Sun, I realized that travelling has\
  \ something to do with discovering the strange yet fascinating relationship between\
  \ man and earth, and for a brief moment I felt like I could fly.\n\nThis place has\
  \ a different vibe, that kind of energy that becomes really hard to explain to your\
  \ friends, that kind of energy that only few places in the world can transfer to\
  \ your body and Machu Picchu is certainly one of those places."
