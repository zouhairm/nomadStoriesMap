Text: "\"One Euro for the toilet\"\n\nThat's the info I got once I want to go to the\
  \ toilet, once upon a time, in the northern hemisphere of Europe.\n\nI'm kind of\
  \ the person that go to toilet, very very often and regular - like once in every\
  \ 30 minutes (Yes, even when I was sleeping sometimes)\n\nI was in the heart of\
  \ Helsinki, capital of the 2018 happiest country on earth; Helsinki Cathedral.\n\
  After climbed up hundreds of stairs, we reached at the doorstep of the magical,\
  \ simple, huge, white Cathedral. I saw a wonderful bustling Helsinki from the top\
  \ and all the big effort to get the top was paid off - especially when you climbed\
  \ with your 2 years old kid and her stroller as well.\n\nI am a travelling addict,\
  \ that what I describe about myself. Everytime I get a chance to travel the world\
  \ - like cheap fare, long holiday or mileage redemption, most of the time I will\
  \ take it.\n\nI grew up in an ordinary (and simple) family in crowded city of Jakarta,\
  \ Indonesia. I am living in two worlds; once I was living in the era where never\
  \ imagine to go overseas because I and my family couldn't afford the airfare, and\
  \ for us, travelling was a very luxurious thing. Now, I'd say that I'm living in\
  \ a better circumstances where the universe help me by providing cheaper fare and\
  \ internet in our hand, and I have much more spare resources to do travelling (thanks\
  \ God for your blessing).\n\nOur little famliy got another blessing in 2018 when\
  \ we found an unrealistic round-trip ticket from Jakarta to Moscow just for around\
  \ USD 450/person and it's just at the same time with 2018 Russia World Cup!!!\n\
  Attending the world cup match was one of my greatest childhood dream - a thing that\
  \ I'm scare to think of - it's too a big dream for myself, but, I made it, not only\
  \ for myself, but also bring my wife and little kid there.\n\nWe had 3 weeks in\
  \ total for this journey, and we want to utilize this timeframe to visit as many\
  \ as countries that we can. We have some options, but we decided to explore the\
  \ Baltic states and plus FINLAND!! Nominated as the happiest country in 2018.\n\n\
  To make long story short, we touched down in our starting point, Moscow. From there,\
  \ we continue our trip to beautiful Lithuania, went up to rustic Latvia, sexy Estonia\
  \ and finally we arrived in Helsinki, capital of Finland, just 2 hours away from\
  \ Tallinn by a huge ferry.\n\nOur excitement was at the same level like the award\
  \ given to this country when we arrived at the Helsinki port. We were expecting\
  \ everything would be perfect in this \"utopia\" country. \nAfter went around and\
  \ had some meals, we realized that this happy country was much more expensive compare\
  \ to other country that we've been. And, even we need to drop 1 Euro to go to toilet.\n\
  \nI don't really mind to pay the toilet fee, but for the people who's coming from\
  \ the developing country, 1 Euro equal to 1 meal package for my lunch.\n\n\"Ha..\
  \ ha.. ha..\"\nThat's only my expression.\nFinally I got a conclusion, happiness\
  \ is a very valuable. Many effort and price we need to pay to get the happiness\
  \ (in life).\n\nThanks for the lesson that \"you\" taught through this trip.\n\n\
  See \"you\" on the next one!"
