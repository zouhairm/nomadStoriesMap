Text: "There were at least eighty of us. They kept us in the basement for what felt\
  \ like hours. In reality, it was probably no more than thirty minutes, but when\
  \ faced with the unknown, even one minute can feel like eternity. The loudest sound\
  \ was the buzzing of our nerves, drowning the whispered conversations and anxious\
  \ questions. And the worst part? We were all here by choice.\n\tAt first it was\
  \ a relief to get out of the hot sun where we had waited, some for hours. The gray\
  \ concrete basement was cool and shaded, and we finally got to sit. But gradually\
  \ the hard floor became uncomfortable. The waiting seemed endless. \n\tFinally,\
  \ a woman came out to speak to us.\n\t\"We'll take you ten at a time. Give your\
  \ paper to the person at the door, then line up in order.\"\n\tI examined the adolescents\
  \ in line before me. I had worried about what to wear, but the boys and girls here\
  \ were dressed in anything from neatly pressed school uniforms to T-shirts and jeans\
  \ to athletic wear. Some of the girls wore cosmetics and had their hair styled,\
  \ but most were bare-faced with their straight black hair down or pulled simply\
  \ back from their faces. The boys were more generic \u2013 no makeup needed and\
  \ hair casually styled or not at all. Appearances varied from beautiful and sculpted\
  \ to homely and rumpled. More tended toward the latter end of the scale. \n\tWhen\
  \ my row was called, I wondered for a moment if my knees would still straighten.\
  \ My heart was trying its best to burst through my sternum, but I held my head up\
  \ in an attempt to appear confident. We stood bravely in a line in front of three\
  \ young women at a folding table and a video camera on a tripod. The women looked\
  \ bored.\n\t\"When we're ready we'll signal the first in line to begin. We'll signal\
  \ each of you in turn.\"\n\tThey waved the first girl to begin, hardly looking up\
  \ from our forms on the table before them. Why had I volunteered to stand before\
  \ this firing squad of indifferent executioners?\n\tThe pudgy boy in a bright orange\
  \ polo shirt and thick-rimmed fashion glasses two spaces in front of me had a fabulous\
  \ voice. Powerful, precise, and full of feeling. He wasn't handsome, but perhaps\
  \ his singing would make up for that. The judges' highly trained, focused observation\
  \ dissected him like they were performing surgery with their eyes.\n\t\"Thank you.\"\
  \n\tHe had barely begun. It was like that for each of us. No one had a chance to\
  \ complete the already-short song selection he or she had prepared. No questions\
  \ were asked of us \u2013 not even the single white girl in the midst of the Asian\
  \ youth. No doubt there were many other foreigners auditioning for this prestigious\
  \ entertainment agency. Perhaps even Westerners, though I had not seen any others.\n\
  \tI sang my snippet. Better than I had hoped. Vibrating with nerves, but the words\
  \ were right, the melody intact. In a matter of seconds, we were through. No one\
  \ was asked to remain behind. The assurance that we would be contacted if selected\
  \ was rote and bland. We were ushered out. Hours spent together in the pursuit of\
  \ a common goal had left us as much strangers as when we first stood next to each\
  \ other under the morning sun. I would never recognize one of these applicants if\
  \ I passed them in the street. I don't think they would recognize me either, for\
  \ all I looked so different. \n\tHours of waiting for mere seconds to distinguish\
  \ ourselves. Emerging from the basement into the hot summer afternoon in downtown\
  \ Seoul was as much a relief as if we had really been prisoners just granted freedom.\
  \ Even if I never experience the inside of the South Korean pop music scene, my\
  \ appreciation for the artists, and the hopefuls, is now fathoms deeper."
