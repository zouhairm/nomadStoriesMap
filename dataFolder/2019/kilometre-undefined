Text: "Make sure you have an up-to-date will.\n\nOn my government\u2019s travel advice\
  \ website, the Russian Republic of North Ossetia is classified as \u2018Do Not Travel\u2019\
  . The above is one of their cheerful pieces of advice for those who nevertheless\
  \ feel the compulsion to visit such regions. \n\nI told this, in broken Russian,\
  \ to my interlocutor, who chuckled and told a few of the other passengers in our\
  \ carriage. We were on a Moscow-bound train from Vladikavkaz, North Ossetia\u2019\
  s capital, and the passengers were all ethnic Ossetians. \n\nAnisya turned back\
  \ to me. \u201COssetia\u2019s not dangerous. We\u2019re hospitable people. When\
  \ you visit again you should stay with me.\u201D\n\nShe said \u2018when\u2019 instead\
  \ of \u2018if\u2019 as though it were a foregone conclusion. \n\nI asked, \u201C\
  Why are you going to Moscow?\u201D\n\n\u201CBecause,\u201D she said, opening an\
  \ unlabelled bottle of yellow liquid, \"I've never been.\"\n\nShe poured me a shot\
  \ of what turned out to be homemade corn vodka. It had a bite like the Yekaterinburg\
  \ wind.\n\nOnce I could speak again, I said, \u201CI thought alcohol wasn\u2019\
  t allowed on trains.\u201D The nervous traveller in me knew the rules, but I\u2019\
  d also seen the beer cans piling up in the carriage\u2019s communal garbage bag.\n\
  \n\u201CIt\u2019s always allowed! And in Moscow,\u201D she grinned, \u201Ceverything\u2019\
  s allowed!\u201D\n\nShe took out some kebabs and grapefruit and shared it among\
  \ the passengers. Someone had a pirog, an Ossetian pie whose roundness represents\
  \ the universe, and we had a piece each. It was heavy like a shooting star and just\
  \ as elusive; you don\u2019t realise it\u2019s gone until all that\u2019s left is\
  \ a little sweetness along your teeth, a goodbye kiss.\n\nI contributed Australian\
  \ biscuits and bad grammar. Anisya kept offering me more food. I declined; it didn\u2019\
  t look like she had enough for herself. In my Vladikavkaz hostel, I remembered,\
  \ the receptionist had offered me his dinner once. \n\nI went to the toilet, slipping\
  \ past a lady who\u2019d boarded alone but who was now standing in the corridor\
  \ chatting, waving her mug and spilling tea on laughing new friends. The bathroom\
  \ was flooded. I waddled back. Anisya took one look at my wet feet and poured me\
  \ more vodka. \n\nThen she slid her iPhone across the table. In the notepad app\
  \ she\u2019d written, \u201CI don\u2019t like boys. Quiet only.\u201D\n\nI read\
  \ it three times to make sure. I looked up. Swallowed. Quiet only. Leaned in. \u201C\
  Me, neither.\u201D I waited for the all-too-familiar prehensile tendril of shame,\
  \ which rented my innards and was a few years in arrears, to awake. It slept on.\n\
  \nHead tilted, she smiled. \u201CI could tell at once.\u201D Quiet only. \u201C\
  In Russia it\u2019s not allowed. But in Moscow-\u201D\n\nI had already been to Moscow.\
  \ I said nothing.\n\nAnisya prepared for an afternoon nap. The man in the bunk above\
  \ me, who I only ever heard say \u201CI\u2019ll help\u201D, assisted in laying out\
  \ her bed. I watched her head disappear under the blanket, then turned to the window.\n\
  \nWind-blown snow glittered in angled sunlight and the birches, straight and still,\
  \ stood guard. We passed many stations, some bearing simple names like Kilometre\
  \ 1736, the number marking the distance to the country\u2019s capital. I thought\
  \ about Ossetian kindness and the promise of Moscow.\n\nAnisya slept, perhaps dreaming\
  \ about the latter. As for me, I was looking at return tickets and updating my will."
