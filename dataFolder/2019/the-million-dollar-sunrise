Text: "I was waiting at the bus-stand to take the bus to Pokhara \u2013 all my friends\
  \ were already in the bus, and I was boarding the bus from a different stop. \n\
  Pokhara is one of the most famous travel destinations in Nepal. It is also a midpoint\
  \ for many other amazing places you can travel to. Usually, people spend one night\
  \ there and start their trip the next morning. We were doing exactly that \u2013\
  \ staying the night in Pokhara and going someplace else, but I did not know which\
  \ \u201Csomeplace\u201D were we going to and I was in for a surprise! \nThe bus\
  \ finally came, I boarded the bus, I looked at my friend who was planning this \u201C\
  surprise\u201D, she was smirking a little bit and that scared me. \n\u201CWHERE\
  \ ARE WE GOING?!\u201D \u2013 I screamed, because the anticipation was killing me!\
  \ \n\u201CWe are going to Ghandruk, and\u201D \nI still remember reading about the\
  \ beauty of Ghandruk in sixth grade and envisioning of visiting the place. \nShe\
  \ continued, \u201Cfrom there, we are taking the Ghandruk-Ghorepani hiking trail\
  \ to Poonhill.\u201D \nI love hiking but this was a 12-hours hike and I was about\
  \ to have my periods. I had a million different emotions at the same time but all\
  \ I said was, \u201CI am in for an adventure!\u201D  \nWe spent one night in Pokhara\
  \ as planned, walking by the regal lake, dreaming of doing that with your partner\
  \ someday, and grooving to the live music at a bar. The next day, two bumpy bus\
  \ rides, home-coming of my periods and one hour of trek later, we reached Ghandruk,\
  \ and the place was captivating. The textbooks did not do justice to the grandeur\
  \ of this place. We strolled around for a while, but decided to rest because the\
  \ next day was going to be a long one. \nI was the first one to wake up, because\
  \ I had period cramps. I opened the windows and there was the breathtaking Himalayas\
  \ standing in all its glory. I completely forgot about the pain and I was I ready\
  \ for the day. I would probably get a lot of stuff done if I woke up to such a view\
  \ every day. \nWe were a group of 6 people \u2013 2 boys and 4 girls, and with us\
  \ was the same kid who had decided to guide us through the trail. When we started,\
  \ I was behind everyone. I had fallen down twice already within the first 30 minutes\
  \ of walking (Being clumsy is really a disadvantage for hikers, apparently!), but\
  \ I did not want to be the one lagging behind, so I started upping my game and soon,\
  \ I was ahead of everyone! I was enjoying every bit of the walk. It was a 12-hour\
  \ hike, most of which I walked alone, whilst enjoying the greenery, chilling by\
  \ the lake, admiring the waterfalls and taking difficult shortcuts. I felt a sense\
  \ of independence that I had never felt before. I did not need anyone to carry my\
  \ backpack or help me climb up the hills. I was doing it all on my own. I did fall\
  \ many times, but I was getting up by myself and I continued walking. \nAfter 12\
  \ hours of hike, we reached Ghorepani, which was where we were staying the night.\
  \ I was so proud of myself, because I reached there first. The next day, we started\
  \ our hike at 4 am because we wanted to see the sunrise. We started the one hour,\
  \ uphill hike which was much more difficult than what we felt the previous day but\
  \ WE WERE GOING TO SEE THAT SUNRISE! We reached at the top before the sun had rose.\
  \ So, we saw the sun slowly come up from behind the majestic Himalayas, while the\
  \ sky turned from completely dark to navy blue to orange to a beautiful sky blue.\
  \ It felt like transcendence. All the pain, the fatigue, the sleeplessness was worth\
  \ this one 5-minute experience! \nWe all just sat there, absorbed by the magic that\
  \ we had just witnessed and looked at each other with big smiles on our faces -\
  \ 3210m high from the main land, infinity times high on life."
