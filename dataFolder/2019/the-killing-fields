Text: "The unrelenting heat of the capital suggested a singlet, and a scarf - to cover\
  \ when needed; Royal Palace regulations, however, did not. With the weather taking\
  \ it's toll, it was in a Tuk Tuk for a one minute drive back to the hotel for clothes\
  \ with a royal tick of approval.\n\nOccupied by the Cambodian Royal family since\
  \ the 1860\u2019s, sans a short period in which the Khmer Rouge placed the country\
  \ in turmoil, the Royal Palace is both an ostentatious display of wealth and an\
  \ inspiring feat of architecture. In a sad irony, the neighbouring park is home\
  \ to many homeless hammock dwellers; with more than just the fence separating the\
  \ two worlds. \n\n$15 US is all that is needed for a tuk tuk for the day. A gentle\
  \ and protective driver, Gabir, was to be our guide for the day.\n\nToul Sleng Genocide\
  \ Museum is a tribute to the onsite prison, S-21. This prison was the site of torture,\
  \ interrogation, starvation, disease and despair. Prisoners were forced to deliver\
  \ false confessions of treachery, disloyalty and international espionage. The classrooms\
  \ were crudely transformed into crammed cells by haphazard brick walls. All the\
  \ women's hair was chopped to shoulder length to satisfy Pol Pot, as long hair displayed\
  \ Vietnamese characteristics. Of the 18,000 prisoners that were dragged through\
  \ the gates, seven survived. Seven.  Liberation came from the Vietnamese in 1979.\
  \ \n\nThe road from Phnom Penh to the Killing Fields was like any other: traffic\
  \ chaos, roadside shops and scattered trash, but an uncomfortable feeling was settling\
  \ in. This is the last route that thousands of innocent, terrified, and exhausted\
  \ Cambodians travelled. It's hard to fathom that such atrocities occurred so recently.\
  \ \n\nPol Pot and his Khmer Rouge regime envisaged a communist ideal: pure agrarian\
  \ society, self-sufficient with no need for foreign, especially Western influence,\
  \ intellects, and traitors to the Khmer Rouge regime. From his first day of power,\
  \ the way Cambodians acted, who they spoke to, their jobs and where they lived was\
  \ dictated by this delusional tyrant. Intellects were seen as a threat; doctors,\
  \ teachers, including those who wore glasses and those with soft hands; were as\
  \ such, killed. Pol Pots theorised that to kill the grass, you must destroy the\
  \ roots, to justify his slaughter of up to 3 million men, women and children. \n\
  \nPol Pot's early life, education, intellectual rejection, climb to power, 'pure\
  \ society' ideal, systematic human slaughter, ultimate demise and suspicious death\
  \ draws uncanny similarities to Adolf Hitler. \n\nWe arrived at Choeung Ek where\
  \ 20,000 people were murdered and discarded in mass graves. One of over 300 killing\
  \ fields scattered all over the country. As we entered, everything seems ok, at\
  \ this moment of naivety this respectful moment to the genocide is just somewhat\
  \ surreal. \n\nThe audio guide tells the harrowing struggle of prisoners at the\
  \ hands of their barbaric executioners. All visitors fall into meaningful silence\
  \ as they stroll around, careful to not step on bones as the emerge due to the rain.\
  \ It is a silence to respect the tens of thousands who were so cruelly murdered\
  \ here. \n\nOne mass grave was the involuntary home to 166 decapitated Khmer Rouge\
  \ soldiers. Defectors of the regime. They were accused of having Cambodian bodies,\
  \ but Vietnamese heads. Pol Pot stated that \"killing an innocent by mistake it\
  \ better than letting a traitor live by mistake\".\n\nNearby a tree was adorned\
  \ with hand made bracelets. These are a token of respect to the many children who\
  \ were beaten against. Why? Simply, to save bullets. \n\nOne piece that will be\
  \ hard to forget were the last sounds that the victims heard: a hybrid of local\
  \ music and a diesel generator orchestrated to disguise the piercing screams that\
  \ would penetrate the still, and lonely nights. \n \nAll who visit are moved by\
  \ the sombre dignity of this monument to systematic human slaughter. It's incomprehensible\
  \ that ordinary people could morph into barbaric monsters in an instant. \n\nThe\
  \ return trip back to Phnom Penh was slower than the trip out, perhaps the sobering\
  \ effects of Choeung Ek were playing a part."
