Text: "Ha Long Bay is the stuff of legend. Of dragons and jewels, divine fire and\
  \ emerald walls. Of a mother and her children, sent from the Heavens to defend against\
  \ an invading enemy. The story is so woven into the fabric of the Vietnamese culture\
  \ that it even lends itself to the bay\u2019s name. \u201CHa Long,\u201D which means\
  \ \u201CDescending Dragon.\u201D\n\nOut at sea is where we found ourselves. A two\
  \ night soir\xE9e aboard a luxury cruise, thankful for the opportunity and what\
  \ was to come. It was a far cry from our typical backpacker accommodations; a gift\
  \ to the woman who boarded the boat a girlfriend and would disembark a fianc\xE9\
  e.\n\nLeading up to the moment, however, much was still unknown, including if this\
  \ would indeed be the time and place, but then, something happened.\n\nAs we paddled\
  \ our kayak through the hushed waters on day one, a single red rose floated by.\
  \ Seated in front, she swooped it up in an instant, nestling it in the grooves between\
  \ us. To her, an amusing encounter. To me, a sign. I knew then that this would be\
  \ the final day of mere dating.\n\nThe next day, I was all nerves. As the rose rested\
  \ on the windowsill of our room and as the ring box, equal in its shade of red,\
  \ bulged and burned in my pocket, I still did not know the exact plan. The details\
  \ of the upcoming sequence amiss.\n\nThe day progressed. A climb through a cave,\
  \ a bbq on the beach. All gorgeous in their own right, but without the privacy and\
  \ intangible romanticism I craved.\n\nIt would have to be on the kayak, I thought.\
  \ Only something wasn\u2019t right. There would be no one knee, no real way for\
  \ her to even turn around or embrace. But the sign! This was to be it. I felt it.\n\
  \nAnd, apparently, so did the world. For moments later, as we stepped off the small\
  \ transfer boat and back onto the ship for a bit of respite, I was discretely pulled\
  \ aside. It was our cruise guide, it was regarding what I wrote when I arranged\
  \ the booking. The secret I had shared with only them and no one else.\n\nDuring\
  \ our minute long exchange, I became light. The weight so quickly released from\
  \ my shoulders that I could\u2019ve floated away. A smile so wide, it would be almost\
  \ impossible to hide.\n\nThere was a beach, he explained, tucked away in a sheltered\
  \ stretch of the sea. The group would go left and we would go right, eyes fixed\
  \ on a separate guide, who would steer us toward its sandy shores. It was perfect.\
  \ I could\u2019ve kissed him in that moment, but that I would save for another.\n\
  \nBack in the room, there was work to be done, a poem I had begun on a stretch of\
  \ Zambian road, yet which still required a final verse. Just then, it came to me.\
  \ The words assuming ink form, as they tumbled out through a shaky pen.\n\nThe announcement\
  \ sounded. It was time to congregate at the back of the boat. Life vests on, oars\
  \ at the ready, we set forth. Into the unknown and into the next chapter.\n\nOnly\
  \ the pages were stuck. Beaches came and went, yet we continued to speed by. My\
  \ heart raced. But then, just as quickly as every distraught thought arose, they\
  \ vanished, and appeared the most perfect of reverse oases. Our guide performed\
  \ a nod of synced understanding and propelled away.\n\nShe knew. And I knew that\
  \ she knew. And on a rock sculpted for this moment, she sat. I cried before the\
  \ poem even emerged from my pocket and continued to do so all the way through its\
  \ reading. It\u2019s what I do. A tune softly whispered from my phone, as we jumped\
  \ and hugged and laughed. I couldn\u2019t even remember if she said yes, so she\
  \ said it again.\n\nThere\u2019s roughly two thousand islands and islets scattered\
  \ across Ha Long Bay. Limestone karsts with fabled emerald origin. Yet to two people\
  \ on one of those islands, it\u2019s a ring of silver and Tanzanite which will tell\
  \ the tale."
