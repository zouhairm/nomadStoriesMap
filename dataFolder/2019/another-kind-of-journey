Text: "The day I came back home, after my long journey, I said : \"Ok, tomorrow I\
  \ will start to run to get myself back in shape.\"\n\nI run. \n\nOnly three days.\n\
  \nSo, I said to myself : \"I will join spin classes, so I will be trained for my\
  \ solo bike trip in Canada.\"\n\nDone!\n\nI biked in beautiful imaginary lowlands,\
  \ up and down shiny green hills, on the sand at the beach and, at the end, in my\
  \ best visions, I reached the top of the mountain. \n\nThen I stopped.\n\nThe day\
  \ I came back home, I decided to read one book a week.\n\nIt's been seventeen weeks,\
  \ I am still at the seventh book.\n\nOne day, I woke up and I decided to learn to\
  \ play guitar by myself.\n\nWell, my fingers say they do not want to play that F,\
  \ F, F, fudge F chord!\n\nEven before, another day, a surge of impatience woke me\
  \ up with the voice of my inner ghost : \"It's been two months down here, go away,\
  \ NOW!!\".\n\nSo, I booked a flight ticket to Reykjavik and from there other one\
  \ to Toronto. The daily mantra became: \"Ehy, babe, within two months you will fly\
  \ away.\".\n\nIn all of this:\n\n- One of the many mornings I proclaimed myself\
  \ Queen Of The Neighborhood because, sitting outside on the porch, I did not have\
  \ anything else to do;\n\n- I bought a little tree and I named it Ernesto. I caressed\
  \ it every day, in exchange it does not die. For now;\n\n- After my 27th birthday,\
  \ I decided it was time to bloom into a woman, so I bought a pair of high-heeled\
  \ boots (6cm).\n\nI wore the boots only once, so uncomfortable!;\n\n- I bought a\
  \ new pair of glasses. They looked great on me.\n\nI lost them after a week;\n\n\
  - After three months, I found a job. Six days a week, almost nine hours a day. I\
  \ learned how to make 'calzoni', 'focacce' and other typical food of my region.\
  \ I laughed and I got angry, I danced and I sang the opera with my nightingale voice,\
  \ I talked about chief systems but most of all I talked senseless and then I laughed\
  \ again and again and then I quit. After a month.\n\nThe day I came back home, though,\
  \ I did not expect that, one day, the flight ticket to Toronto would become a ticket\
  \ to Rome plus college application (trying to get the degree again and again and\
  \ again) and, also, that one night, back home from work, I would have sat on the\
  \ edge of the bed and cried.\n\nI haven't cried for a whole year.\n\nEvery day,\
  \ though, I took a picture from the porch: the tree on the right, the apartment\
  \ building in the middle, the cupola of the church, so far, on the left.\n\n121\
  \ days, 121 pictures. To see thru and to understand why leave everything again.\n\
  \nI met so many wonderful people, during these 121 days. Some of them allowed me\
  \ to embrace their deepest feelings and therefore mine, too; about the others, however,\
  \ I could touch only the surface and it was ok, too because every single thing reminds\
  \ me a quote of a great human (as well as a doctor, philosopher, physician, writer)\
  \ Albert Schweitzer, who sais : \"You must not expect anything from others. It's\
  \ you, of yourself, of whom you must ask a lot. Only from oneself has one the right\
  \ to ask everything and anything. This way it's up to you - your own choices - what\
  \ you get from others remains a present, a gift.\".\n\nThis was also a journey,\
  \ another kind of journey.\n\n...and I thought that nothing would happen at home.\n\
  \nSo, after four months, it was time to pack because Iceland was waiting for me...\
  \ but, well, this is another story."
