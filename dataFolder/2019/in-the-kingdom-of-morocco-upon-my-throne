Text: "This was the first time travelling I\u2019ve ever felt so naive. Forgetting\
  \ I was leaving the Western civilization and heading to Africa I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ things to be so different. Reality reached out and slapped me in the face with\
  \ a clammy hand within minutes of arriving in Rabat.\n\nI was curious and vigilant,\
  \ scared and very western looking. There was no hiding from the masses. After walking\
  \ around the Medina trying to find my bearings between the narrow winding streets\
  \ I eventually found my Riad\u2026after seeing the bathrooms I made the rash decision\
  \ not to eat for 3 days as I couldn\u2019t comprehend a way to utilize the hole\
  \ in the floor, without making a mess of myself. Of all the things my father had\
  \ taught me growing up, using a spoon, writing my name, swimming even! But nothing\
  \ came even remotely close to this situation... Squatting in a hole. \n\nEventually\
  \ I had to eat. I was walking so much I was running on empty. And Tea. Lots of Tea.\
  \ I was in my hotel and I couldn\u2019t find the hole. Time wasn\u2019t on my side\
  \ so I had to do what I had to do. In the porcelain toilet. To my horror when it\
  \ was time to leave it wouldn\u2019t flush\u2026 I had a stage 5 cling-on staring\
  \ at me, I could almost hear it saying \u201Ctypical tourist\u201D. I spent at least\
  \ 5 minutes filling the toilet with water, trying to flush\u2026I done all I could\
  \ do but it wouldn\u2019t sink. At this point I was running late so I had to go..\
  \ Leaving my mark there and all. I was in my room getting my belongings together\
  \ when I heard a young girl say to her mother \u201Cyucky\u201D. At that very moment\
  \ I realized they had entered the toilet. I was paralyzed with fear and embarrassment\
  \ and didn\u2019t want to walk past. So in true Moroccan style I loitered like a\
  \ local and waited in my room until I heard them head back up stairs.\nThis didn\u2019\
  t happen as I had planned. Before long I heard the plumber banging tools around\
  \ in the bathroom area trying to plunge the pipes. Removing pieces, draining others.\
  \ Safe to say....Morocco couldn\u2019t handle me!!"
