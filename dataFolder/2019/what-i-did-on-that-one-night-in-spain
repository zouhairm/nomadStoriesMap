Text: "I'd arrived in Spain with the last vestiges of my marriage crumbling. I'd started\
  \ in Barcelona, then made my way to Granada and the impressive Alhambra, before\
  \ finally landing in Seville. \n\nIn Seville, I'd already tired of the main attractions.\
  \ The main arteries that ran by the Seville Cathedral and Azucar Real were jammed\
  \ with British tourists. In Spain, my first time traveling alone, I realized that\
  \ it was lovely to walk around at night, when the crowds had thinned and the air\
  \ cooled. Then I could wander the serpentine streets until I came upon the Cathedral,\
  \ illuminated by the soft white lights from the street and take pictures of its\
  \ gargantuan spires, its reflective glass. \n\nBut I'd tired of being alone after\
  \ two days. Two days of sipping beers, eating tender beef, small bits of octopus\
  \ in beds of brown rice, befriending the bar tender or a couple in the time it took\
  \ to eat three tapas. Maria and I met in the usual way these days, via our phones.\
  \ She'd told me that I must attend the flamenco dancing offered up by the local\
  \ students, and I'd sat alone, mesmerized by the stomping of the dancer's feet,\
  \ the twirling of dresses, and the raw passion of the flamenco. \n\nAfter the dance,\
  \ I wandered down to the main square and met Maria. She was a head shorter than\
  \ me, and she had a quick smile. We walked through the main square where a group\
  \ of young people were dancing, their bodies twining round one another as the music\
  \ played. Maria said hi to a friend, mentioned she'd been practicing this particular\
  \ dance, but we just stood there, admiring the way that the bodies coiled like snakes.\
  \ \n\nWe walked around Seville to some of her favorite tapas bars. She'd lived in\
  \ Seville her whole life, forty years. And we talked as we stood at the bar, where\
  \ I used my tongue to eat my first snail. Maria told me about college, about the\
  \ men she'd dated, the way that her life hadn't quite turned out like she wanted.\
  \ We drank beers and exchanged who paid as the night wore on. \n\nAfter more beers,\
  \ she took me to a place in Seville where I'd wandered the night before, it's called\
  \ the Jungle she said.  The streets were filled with people, young and old, a panoply\
  \ of bodies and hair colors. In America, going out when you're past thirty is considered\
  \ a sin. I felt, at thirty-seven, that I'd found the sort of culture that I'd always\
  \ been looking for. I loved staying awake late into the night, drinking wine, dancing,\
  \ or talking over the ways that everything falls short of what we imagined. \n\n\
  Maria and I entered a throng of bodies, and she managed to get to the bar and buy\
  \ us drinks. As we wandered towards the dance floor, she hugged a friend and introduced\
  \ me as an American, in town for one night. And then we wandered through the dusty\
  \ light, through the techno haze, and danced together as if we'd both lived in Seville\
  \ our whole lives. As though we'd both been waiting for this particular moment,\
  \ on a warm May night in Spain."
