Text: "I sat down at the top, feeling like I was about to faint. The ruins, a few\
  \ meters away, still seemed to be miles away. At 4000 meters, the height of the\
  \ Isla del sol, every physical effort becomes twice as hard, and my empty stomach\
  \ was complaining stubbornly about the 5-hour-trek I had just finished. The curious\
  \ thing about \"Soroche\" (altitude sickness) is that it doesn't hit you right away.\
  \ It slowly sweeps on you, like the green waves crashing on the white sand beaches\
  \ of the highest lake in the world. By the time it settles in, all you can do is\
  \ sit down, breathe and wait. Maybe pray. \nI took the water bottle from the daypack\
  \ and smiled at the thought of the \"ahicito nom\xE1\" that didn't actually mean\
  \ \"nearby\". I figured Distance, just as Time, must be perceived differently in\
  \ a place where buses, cars or phones didn't exist. Locals would often use donkeys\
  \ or boats to take things around the island and they were very used to walking the\
  \ trail I had just finished. Thus, the \"ahicito nom\xE1\".\nThe shades of pink\
  \ and orange on the sky told me it was too late to make it back to the north of\
  \ the island that day, and that I needed to somehow find a place to spend the night\
  \ on less than 20 soles. Reluctantly, I got on my feet\nIt was a short walk to the\
  \ small array of houses that grouped together on the west shore. It was hard to\
  \ distinguish them, but my survival instinct immediately identified a store.\"Maybe\
  \ they own a guest house too\" I thought, trying to convince myself that spending\
  \ the only money I had on food wasn't a reckless idea. I walked into a small shop\
  \ that held a strange combination of products: cleaning products, groceries, some\
  \ electronics, candies. Behind the counter was Basilia. Her small body and soft\
  \ face made her look like she might be 15 years old, but there was old wisdom in\
  \ her ways, a tranquillity that comes only with years. She was happy that I spoke\
  \ Spanish. \"Do you speak any other languages?\", I asked.\"I studied Aymara, our\
  \ local language, in college. I wanted to become a linguist, but when my father\
  \ got ill, I had to return to help my family work the land. In the island, every\
  \ family trades their products with other families. So, they needed me. I came back\
  \ to help with the shop and with the farm\". The conversation flowed easily between\
  \ us:  she spoke, I listened and asked questions. \"I love languages. I always ask\
  \ people to teach me some words in their language when they come to the shop, and\
  \ I keep everything in this notebook. I speak some French, some Italian, some German...\"\
  . I couldn't believe what I was hearing. The passion with which she learnt and studied,\
  \ without means and with no one to help her inspired me. \"The problem is that we\
  \ don't have teachers on the island that teach other languages, so tourists hire\
  \ guides from La Paz. They don't know our traditions, how we rotate the plantations\
  \ each year to keep the soil from becoming barren. They lie, and nobody can do anything\
  \ about it\". \nAt that point, I had long forgotten about the room, about being\
  \ hungry or cold. I've always known coincidences don't exist, but that day I confirmed\
  \ it. \"Basilia, if it's ok with you, I'd like to help\". She smiled at me eagerly\
  \ as I got on my knee and opened my backpack. I'm not a very organized person and\
  \ when I saw my pen drive in the bottom of my pack earlier that day, I thought it\
  \ was just me being me. A pen drive for a 5hrs trek around an island. Useful, right?\
  \ \"I am an English Teacher for Spanish speakers. In this pen drive I have the material\
  \ for the first 4 levels of English, books, dictionaries, tests. Do you have a computer?\"\
  .\n I slept at her house that night and had dinner with her and her family. \"You\
  \ should stay on the island and teach English at the local school. Would you?\"."
