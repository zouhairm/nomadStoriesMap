Text: "- Ask your question.\n- Should I travel to S\xE3o Paulo or not?\n\nI cut the\
  \ tarot with my left hand, anxious.\nThe tarologist tells me that she does not know\
  \ if I'm going to Sao Paulo, certainly somewhere further south.\n\nI, months ago,\
  \ felt that I had to go back to that city.\nI had just graduated in Film, at the\
  \ federal college of my hometown, Recife.\n\nA month went by and I got a message\
  \ from a friend saying we were going to travel, to shoot a documentary for a television\
  \ channel. I did not even know I was on her team, she had put me there and only\
  \ let me know when the project was chosen. \nShe enrolled 3 projects for 3 different\
  \ cities.\nOnly one passed.\nTo S\xE3o Paulo.\n\nSo, 3 women, a journalist, a producer\
  \ and I the camera, we were going to film a low budget documentary in the immense\
  \ and largest city of southeastern Brazil.\n\nThe film was about a professor of\
  \ literature, Julio, who taught in public School, with a playful and very special\
  \ way.\nThe first day we left our things in an apartment and went to meet the teacher\
  \ at the woman's hospital.\nWe arrived\nwith equipment,\nentusiasm and\nfull of\
  \ students with curious eyes.\nI waited for the administration's authorization to\
  \ go up the stairs to film.\nIt was authorized and I saw the children for the first\
  \ time that were calm, \nreading stories to patients who took morphine to calm their\
  \ pain. All were laughing and exchanging messages of affection. \nNone video editing\
  \ could not convey the feelings of the scene.\n\nCut\n\nEverything was fine on the\
  \ set, except for the apartment we rented.\nIt was a small building, in a quiet\
  \ street, and we took care of a large, friendly dog, that was left with a little\
  \ warning:\n- He does not like the dark.\n\nBy the first day's return we were all\
  \ tired, and when we got in, we rushed to take a shower and relax.\nI was the second,\
  \ the shower burned well in my turn.\nIt was cold, and the shower was not ours,\
  \ nor was it more business hours, it was late, so late that I thought no one would\
  \ come to fix it, but a motorcycle electrician came in the middle of the night.\n\
  He entered the apartment and moved a few strands.\nHe short-circuited.\nEverything\
  \ went out.\nThe lights of the whole building.\nWe were groping the walls until\
  \ I found the syndic to go in the central box trying to light everything back.\n\
  Meanwhile, I heard a bark, the dog was there, in the dark, I ran back to keep him\
  \ company.\nBetween laughter and tears, the light went on, but I was already satisfied\
  \ with my stay in that apartment.\n\nI thanked myself and moved to an apartment\
  \ of a friend, on Avenida S\xE3o Jo\xE3o, in a tall building called Santa Branca.\n\
  I arrived full of suitcases, alone, in the rain.\nAt the suggestion of this friend,\
  \ I began to take a course in photography, near a garden full of flowers, in the\
  \ center of the city.\nAt the end of the class I decided to take a ride with the\
  \ teachers, who shared an apartment in the same neighborhood as I, the Republic,\
  \ near the red line of the subway.\nOn the way, I said:\n- You can leave me there\
  \ on Av. S\xE3o Jo\xE3o, which is fine, I'll walk.\n\nThey said: - You can tell\
  \ the place, we'll leave you in your home.\n\nI said: - It's number 1333.\n\nThey\
  \ said: -  what? Us too!\n\nWhat is the probability?\nI can not even tell you.\n\
  \nThey also won the same education prize, to make a documentary, like mine, in the\
  \ same tv Channel.\nThere were so many synchronicities, that soon we became friends.\n\
  \nI finished the video and never went back there.\nTwo years later, I'm thinking\
  \ about going back.\n\nLast week I was at a friend's house, and her father said\
  \ to me:\n\n- I have a tarot here, do you want to try?\nAsk your question.\nI said:\n\
  - Should I travel to S\xE3o Paulo or not?"
