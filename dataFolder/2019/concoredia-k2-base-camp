Text: "K2 Base Camp and  Concordia\nArranged by Machulo Treks and Tours Pakistan (MTTP),\
  \ our trip started from Islamabad where we stayed for a day. The next morning, we\
  \ took a short, but a very scenic, flight to Skardu. We acquired a great deal of\
  \ interesting information about our destination from the plane's captain, which\
  \ naturally got us pumped for the journey ahead.\nWe passed through Nanga Parbat\
  \ and Lake Saif-ul-Mulook among other landmark destinations. After one day stay\
  \ in Skardu, we left for the village of Askole, We drive through hanging wooden\
  \ bridges, however, made it worth it.\nSituated at a distance of 18kms from Askole,\
  \ we reached Jhula just before sunset. We parked our camp next to the river, which\
  \ afforded us an ethereal view of the Barkhudas mountain peak.\nThe next morning,\
  \ we trekked from Jhula to Payu campsite, which is 22kms away, at 200 metres of\
  \ elevation gain; the route that we took was close to the river bank with many uninhabited\
  \ houses.\nFrom Payu, we made our way to the Baltoro glacier, the focal point of\
  \ our trek. The journey to our next campsite Khoburshe was 15km away, with 500 metres\
  \ elevation gain.\nwe saw the glimpse of the spectacular Trango and Lobsang mountain\
  \ spires as well as the starting point of the serene Baltoro River from here.\n\
  \     The next morning, we trekked from Khoburshe to Urdukas,we crossed two glaciers\
  \ and glacial streams to reach Urdukas, surrounded by tall imposing mountains. It\
  \ is a wonderful campsite that sits atop huge rocks.\nOur next stop was the Goro\
  \ II. It was another long trek of 15kms, with 270 metres of elevation gain. We were\
  \ ecstatic when we saw our first views of the incredible Masherbrum (7821m) and\
  \ Gasherbrum-4 (7925m) mountains. Our campsite at Goro II was the coldest on the\
  \ trek. When I woke up in the middle of the night, my tent was covered in frost.\n\
  \  Our next camp on Concordia glacier was next to Mitre Peak. With that as our reference,\
  \ we walked about 12kms to reach Concordia.\nNear Concordia, we had to negotiate\
  \ many complicated crevasses. We also heard loud songs of the glacier cracking up.\n\
  After what seemed like an eternity, we arrived at our camp on Concordia. Situated\
  \ at 4,600 metres of elevation, the high altitude made us easily breathless, even\
  \ if the movement was something as small as getting up.\nMost expeditions end on\
  \ Concordia after which trekkers head back to Askole. One can also take an alternative\
  \ route by hiking to Ali Camp and then crossing the Gondogoro Pass to enter Hushe\
  \ Valley and return from there. It, however, requires expert technical climbing\
  \ skills.\nIn our case, we decided to visit the K2 base camp, which is approximately\
  \ 11kms away from Concordia,The three of us, including myself, stayed back at the\
  \ K2 base camp for about an hour, and had lunch with an international expedition\
  \ team before returning to Concordia.\nThe return journey from Concordia to Askole\
  \ was 90kms and took us three whole days to return to Askole from where we returned\
  \ to Skardu the same evening"
