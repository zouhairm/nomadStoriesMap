Text: "The last words of Professoressa Giorgia nipped at my ear lobes. \n\t\u201C\u2026\
  pagina quaranta per domani\u2026\u201D\n\tGot it. Emily poked my thigh with her\
  \ kneecap.\n\t\u201CAre you going to the show tonight?\u201D she said. \n\t\u201C\
  What show?\u201D\n\t\u201CSilenzio!\u201D Horatio, the most mature student in the\
  \ program, placed a wrinkled, bony finger to his lips.\n\t\u201CMi dispiace.\u201D\
  \ The bell rang and our classmates shuffled their belongings together. Horatio stared\
  \ at us, angry at our English disrespect.\n\t\u201CFifteen euros at teatro Persiani.\
  \ Were you listening?\u201D\n\t\u201CListening and understanding are different.\u201D\
  \n\tWe walked out of the room. Three flatmates waited for us in the hall.\n\t\u201C\
  Are any of you going to the show tonight?\u201D Emily bumped shoulders with Dan.\n\
  \t\u201CWhat show?\u201D he said.\n\t\u201CSi.\u201D Eduarda pistolled her thumbs\
  \ to the sky. \n\t\u201CIt\u2019s an Italian rock concert! Apparently, it\u2019\
  s a great local band. Drinks and dancing, too. We should check it out.\u201D\n\t\
  \u201CI\u2019m down.\u201D I shot thumb pistols back to Eduarda. \n\t\u201CI told\
  \ Maria I\u2019d hang out with her tonight. Plus that\u2019s a lot of money for\
  \ a show I won\u2019t like.\u201D\n\t\u201CFine. So, us three?\u201D\n\t\u201CHave\
  \ you asked anyone else?\u201D\n\t\u201CYeah. Everyone basically said the same thing\
  \ as Dan.\u201D\n\t\u201CWhen did she say this?\u201D\n\t\u201CYesterday they told\
  \ us.\u201D Eduarda laughed. Our group started to walk toward the pizzeria\u2014\
  this week\u2019s ritual\u2014and further discussed the evening plans.\n\nJust after\
  \ seven, we entered the theatre. The ushers wore tuxedos and a quick peek into the\
  \ theatre revealed solid oak finished red velvet seats, gold-leaf balconies, and\
  \ a godly scene painted over the entire ceiling.\u201CIs this the right show?\u201D\
  \n\t\u201CYes.\u201D Eduarda pointed at a sign on the door. We looked at each other.\n\
  \t\u201CHow many times will you enjoy a show performed in a seventeenth-century\
  \ theatre?\u201D Emily handed her money to the ticket-taker.\n\t\u201C\xC8 vero.\u201D\
  \n\t\u201COkay. But if it\u2019s opera, I might have to get wasted and come back.\u201D\
  \n\nWe sat in our seats for almost an hour before the lights dimmed. Cheers and\
  \ inaudible heckles tickled the acoustically consummate area. Five musicians footed\
  \ the stage. I cannot stress the overwhelming joy to see scraggly men in jeans.\
  \ After a few moments of guitar tuning, floor scuffing, supposed-to-be-water-but-everyone-knows-its-not\
  \ drinking, and awkward silence, the lead singer took the mic and introduced the\
  \ band. \n\t\u201CHello Recanati, how you doin\u2019?\u201D\n\tHis words caused\
  \ almost dead silence except for the sound of Emily and I slapping each other.\n\
  \t\u201CWe\u2019re a small alternative rock band from Chicago and we\u2019re touring\
  \ around obviously. We\u2019re so glad you could have us\u2014this is a beautiful\
  \ place with beautiful people. We think it\u2019s haunted, though, so, we\u2019\
  ll carry on now before the ghost returns. We think he hates Americans. Is anybody\
  \ here American?\u201D \n\tEmily\u2019s American blood vibrated. Too shy, she relied\
  \ on the bold Canadian to take the task of giving comfort to these men who were\
  \ about to perform for people who had no idea what the hell they just said. I hollered\
  \ and raised my arms.\n\t\u201CShut the fuck up. From where?\u201D\t\n\t\u201CVirginia!\u201D\
  \n\t\u201CAre you being serious?\u201D\n\t\u201CYes!\u201D Emily answered herself.\n\
  \t\u201CWell, shit, now we actually have to play.\u201D \n\tAt that moment, the\
  \ lights on stage went off and the sound cut. The musicians looked around, called\
  \ for the stagehand. \n\t\u201CIt\u2019s the ghost!\u201D I screamed. Emily slapped\
  \ my arm and snorted. The lead singer pointed in our direction. The stagehands worked\
  \ on the sound for a few minutes before an electric wail erupted from a speaker.\
  \ The band began to play a few notes. The lead took the mic again.\n\t\u201CAlright,\
  \ ghost, I hope you like this one. It\u2019s from an older album. It\u2019s called\
  \ \u2018Bottles and Bones\u2019.\u201D\n\tEduarda hadn\u2019t reacted. Emily turned\
  \ to me, stared.\n\t\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\t\u201CI just can\u2019t believe this. We\
  \ are in Italy in a seventeenth-century theatre listening to a mediocre garage band\
  \ from Chicago. It\u2019s surreal, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\n\t\u201CMaybe. I think\
  \ it\u2019s insanely ironic how we showed up thinking we would be the only ones\
  \ who didn\u2019t know what the fuck was going on but it turns out we are the only\
  \ ones who know what the fuck is going on.\u201D\n       \"And you didn't want to\
  \ come.\""
