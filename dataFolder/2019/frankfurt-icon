Text: "All my thanks to my mother...yes she won the travel in a secure life and we\
  \ had a lot of destinations, but finally was Frankfurt.I don\xB4t know why.But finally\
  \ the travel was good,without rainining and doing sigthseeing from the bus(hop-on\
  \ and hop-off bus).One day I arrived close to the Film Museum,and it was very strange\
  \ because the doors it was similar than a door\xB4s house in a simple city,white\
  \ colour and heavy to push it.The minutes that I stayed there was short because\
  \ I could be closed the Film Museum, but finally I arrived to the shop museum and\
  \ then I buyed two pens for two friends.First I bougth it for me,but I thougth that\
  \ be less sellfish at all,and give it to one of my friends. I take few photos and\
  \ the alien scuplture and the croma it was a surprise. Other day was a deception\
  \ with the tv program called \"the voice\" because I was waiting more voices with\
  \ more talent. But only one sang better than the others. Frankfurt is an icon city\
  \ because appears in the movie \"the A team\",and the tall buildings like New York.\
  \ After the brigdes is similar than the New York bridges but in Europe. Exists different\
  \ kinds of sausages,delicious sandwiches and beers. In this case we not only stay\
  \ in Frankfurt too,we move to Heidelberg from Frankfurt where we met with my brother\
  \ and his wife there. We did a lot of tourism, buying clothes,but we needed in my\
  \ opinion going out but is not secure this city than Madrid. Perhaps the neigborhood\
  \ is different, than I live,and perhaps I needed more simpathic with the people\
  \ that I spoke a little, perhaps I need to leave to my confort zone,that why I write\
  \ this in this  moment.We went 6 days I think, but its not my city where I can leave,perhaps\
  \ I prefer Berlin than Frankfurt.But the metro in Berlin I think it needed  a improvement\
  \ of rails and decorate,it\xB4s too old the trains.Finally I prefer the icon or\
  \ sculpture of the euro for dramatic my situation,and the situation of the rest\
  \ of the world like one poor woman resting to the sculture of the euro with the\
  \ striking colors.We went to D\xFCsseldorf too.We pick up a flixbus,close to the\
  \ station train of Frankfurt,but I only love the Ludwig Museum with the pieces of\
  \  Warhol.After we picked up a boat and we stayed enjoying the landscapes but the\
  \ waitress arrive just when the visit in the boat finish.At the end we looked a\
  \ wedding and my mother don\xB4t stopped filming how to leave from the church the\
  \ married bride and the married groom.Then we come back to Madrid and remmember\
  \ the place and the photos of the travel.And now I am thinking about my coats and\
  \ my coats now are short than before,and now I appears like an onion.I would like\
  \ that my mother please  win another trip and if she want to join with her in the\
  \ travels.I have a Dad,but when I were little yes,when I was litle he payed and\
  \ support me in my crazy travels,but now no,I am growing  I have 30 years old and\
  \ this is a little difference between years and how the thinks can be change.And\
  \ now with the rest of my debts just has been payed I will buy a ticket to another\
  \ place where I pray that be receive in a  good moments and no \"que te den...\"\
  \ like when I was walking in Frankfurt.I hope the people would be happy to look\
  \ at me no like a stranger or a bad person that other people want to hurt me.Finally\
  \ I would like to think in positive and save a lot of money for my short travels.\
  \ Who know what can it happen in one day,one week or one month.I hopefully think\
  \ in good times,like I remember or better. Perhaps I will have to work hard to get\
  \  the famous icon of Frankfurt or simple win the green card lottery in October.\
  \ But it\xB4s a lot of time to wait. While it will continue with the word \"passport\"\
  \ all the time, and with my win of leave of Spain. Greetings from Madrid."
