Text: "The weather is sunny. The skies filled with blue colour. A slight breeze is\
  \ mixing, every now and then, with high winds emphasising, at the same time, my\
  \ current location. I'm in the land of dreamers. I'm walking along the beach and\
  \ observing adjacent (semi-)detached houses. They cost a considerable amount of\
  \ money. Some are newly built with windows going from the floor to the ceiling providing\
  \ a clear view towards the Indian Ocean. You can wake up to this spectacular view\
  \ every day and sooth your senses with the fresh air and waves. I'm in Goa. \nWhat's\
  \ not in goa.. adventure, water sports, seafood, casino, partying, nightlife, biking\
  \ \u2013 all these collectively define what Goa is. This beach getaway is as much\
  \ a favorite of couples as popular with a group of singles. \n\nI sit among rocks\
  \ in the shadow during the sunset. Then I decide to switch my mind off. Go to the\
  \ other side on the mountain that just I conquered (using a cable car). I climb\
  \ on a high rock to admire the sun going down. It's already low on the horizon and\
  \ I can see it hiding there bit by bit. Now I understand why people buy an annual\
  \ ticket to access Table Mountain whenever they want. There is something magical\
  \ about the experience. Few minutes pass and the sun goes down with only the glow\
  \ residing on the horizon. Another half an hour and the colours keep changing until\
  \ total darkness. One can only see spots of lights from the city underneath.\nGoa\
  \ is filled with interesting things, \n- scuba-diving to spot shipwrecks at the\
  \ Mormugao Harbour\nThe mere thought of diving and exploring the wrecks is fascinating.This\
  \ surreal and mysterious experience lets you unravel the mysteries of the past where\
  \ four ships -- including three German ships and an Italian -- blew up and sank\
  \ into the Goan sea in 1943.\nApart from these four ships, there are also shipwrecks\
  \ from the Second World War.\nScuba divers have access to two of these shipwrecks\
  \ -- Suzy and Davy Jones Locker -- which are situated near Grande Island.\n-Crocodile\
  \ spotting and elephant bathing\nThis could possibly be the first time you are up\
  \ close and personal with crocodiles.Scared? This adventure is meant for the brave\
  \ hearts.A small cruise along the Cumbarjua Canal introduces you to the wildlife\
  \ along the river.\nThe crocs sit patiently, covered in muck, but don't be surprised\
  \ if you spot one swimming by.You can also enjoy a day out with elephants.\nEver\
  \ tried your hand at elephant bathing?\nA visit to the Sahakari Spice Farm lets\
  \ you ride through its outskirts and bathe elephants too.\nYou will be provided\
  \ with brushes, buckets and water (of course) to bathe these beautiful animals.\n\
  Once you done, the elephants will take you for a ride, fill their trunks with water\
  \ and splash you happily.\n\nTravel to me is all about rejuvenation and learning.\
  \ It is taking a break and exploring how the life and times and gain some perspective.\
  \ Every place has a different story to tell and as a traveler, a researcher, and\
  \ a teacher, I feel it attracts me even more. Vacation in goa blissed and enlightened\
  \ me."
