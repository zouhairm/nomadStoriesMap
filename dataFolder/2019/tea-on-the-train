Text: "Whether in the middle of Kazakhstan\u2019s sweltering summers or frozen winters,\
  \ Kazakhs continue to boil their tea and drink it hot. While some new supermarkets\
  \ feature refrigerated sodas, the preferred method to hydrate was drinking a scalding\
  \ mixture of boiled water, mint leaves, and so much sugar that an undissolved patina\
  \ forms on the bottom of the cup. To drink tap or bottled water was scandalous;\
  \ a Kazakh friend informed me that drinking nonboiled water would cause horribly\
  \ illness. And so, it was that during the hottest months of summer, with an average\
  \ temperature was 37 degrees Celsius, that I found myself drinking scalding tea\
  \ out of a samovar.  \n\nIn July 2018, I boarded an old Soviet train in Astana,\
  \ the capital of Kazakhstan. I was embarking on a 17-hour overnight journey across\
  \ the Kazakh steppes from Astana to the old capital Almaty. Dressed in a sweaty\
  \ tee-shirt and jeans, with a small backpack and a sun-bleached baseball cap, I\
  \ was the obvious tourist amid the blundering, roaring chaos that is evening train\
  \ travel in Kazakhstan. After being jostled by a shouting man into the wrong train\
  \ car, squeezing my way through frantic corridors full of men yelling, women bustling,\
  \ and children scurrying through any free space available, and a final wrestling\
  \ match with a stuck door, I arrived in the small compartment I had an overnight\
  \ berth in. \n\nThere were four berths in the compartment and four Kazakhs already\
  \ inside; two elderly women in shawls and headscarves already claimed the bottom-most\
  \ berths while with a younger mother nestled with her child in another berth above.\
  \ After a brief greeting, I discovered that only the younger woman seemed to understand\
  \ my crude attempts at Russian. Perhaps a thick Canadian accent made understanding\
  \ impossible. Or it was possible that they did not speak Russian either; most rural\
  \ Kazakhs from southern Kazakhstan speak Kazakh as their mother tongue, while Russian\
  \ is primarily the language of the northern cities. While the train rumbled to life,\
  \ I struggled half-heartedly to communicate through smiles, frequent and enthusiastic\
  \ grunts and nods, and any conceivable Russian word I could remember. After much\
  \ mutual confusion however, I grew discouraged and settled overhead, prepared for\
  \ a long silent journey.\n\nAn hour into the train\u2019s rocking path across the\
  \ steppe, one of the older Kazakh women conjured an ancient pewter samovar from\
  \ a loose fabric bag and placed it on the floor in the middle of the compartment;\
  \ the other rummaged in her own bag and produced ramen noodles, meat and vegetables,\
  \ and an array of spices with a set of small red plastic bowls. Chatting animatedly\
  \ in Kazakh, the two women set to work preparing first tea and then a hot dinner.\
  \ The younger woman contributed some bread to an accumulating pile of food before\
  \ leaving, returning later with two large Kazakh men in dirty slacks and sweaty\
  \ button-up shirts. One brought a dombra, a traditional Kazakh stringed instrument\
  \ similar to a banjo. These two men settled on the lower bunks, causing steel frames\
  \ to groan slightly. All chatted in Kazakh. \n\nUnderprepared for such a feast,\
  \ I offered what little I had from my pack; a shrivelled apple and some beaten-up\
  \ granola bars from Canada. Smiling apologetically at my meager offerings, I returned\
  \ to my upper bunk to continue reading a Russian book I had borrowed. A few minutes\
  \ later, amid the growing cacophony of Kazakh voices below accompanied by the early\
  \ strumming of the dombra, I felt a faint knocking on my bed frame. When I looked,\
  \ I saw one of the Kazakh women holding a steaming bowl of tea towards me. \u201C\
  Po\u017E\xE1lujsta.\u201D \u201CPlease.\u201D She spoke in broken Russian, gesturing\
  \ vigorously with the tea. Some of the boiling tea slopped across the brim. I took\
  \ it carefully from her with a smile of thanks. And promptly burned my fingertips\
  \ on the spilling liquid. Attempting to prevent further disaster, I seared my lips\
  \ and mouth attempting to drain the rest before the train\u2019s next lurch. Perhaps\
  \ taking my tears as gratitude, the woman continued offering steaming cups of tea\
  \ to the compartment. A man laughed heartily. \n\u201CHospitality,\u201D my Kazakh\
  \ friend had said, \u201CIt\u2019s simply what\u2019s right with Kazakhstan.\u201D"
