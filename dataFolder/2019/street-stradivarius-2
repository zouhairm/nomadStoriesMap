Text: "Guanajuato is a beautiful Mexican City that during the colonial era contributed\
  \ to the Spanish Crown a huge amount of precious metals. The ambition for the wealth\
  \ of its bowels was forming a labyrinth of tunnels and on top of the large mansions\
  \ and miner\u2019s neighborhoods. Today, surrounded by hills and full of history,\
  \ it is the stage of many events, the most famous the Cervantino festival. Two years\
  \ ago I went to a race organized by the Mexican army, in the Alh\xF3ndiga de Granaditas\
  \ esplanade; the soldiers where painting your face as a soldier and the infantry\
  \ orchestra playing popular music. I got goosebumps of emotion. In the afternoon\
  \ three fired cannons marked us the start, the resounding noise made us shiver and\
  \ we started running over the innumerable stone tiles at our pace, green, white\
  \ and red papers fell down from the sky, the Mexican Flag colors.\n \nThe route\
  \ was through different streets and tunnels, at our pace people gave encouragement,\
  \ we saw bakeries, taco stands, coffee shops ...one that caught my attention was\
  \ a bar where customers come out to applaud us, some brought their drinks in their\
  \ hands but they managed to cheer us. Suddenly I saw a gentleman with a long white\
  \ beard, glasses and a violin. He also wanted to cheer us up and started playing\
  \ happy notes, the sound of the violin moved something in my chest.\n \nThe next\
  \ day we had breakfast in a restaurant on the street. I was eating some mining enchiladas,\
  \ corn tortillas with sauce and topped with cheese, it was the lunch of miners.\
  \ When among the people's noise, I heard a violin approaching, I turned and confirmed\
  \ that it was the same man from the previous afternoon. The beard, the glasses,\
  \ and the violin, couldn\xB4t be other, he approached and made a comment of my dog,\
  \ I smiled and I turned my attention to my dish, the violinist followed his path\
  \ with his melody.\n  \nLater that day walking through the city we decided to climb\
  \ the 86 steps of the University that gives a beautiful view, you can see hills\
  \ surrounding the city, mine entrances, alleys, people in their daily lives and\
  \ tourists walking, thinking of those nuances of life I was surprised again by the\
  \ melody, again it was the violin, I didn\xB4t know where it was but the notes came\
  \ to me.\n\nThe sun made us crave a beer from the San Fernando Plaza. They were\
  \ putting my cold jar full of beer, salsas and chili powder in front of me when\
  \ I saw the violinist coming through one of the entrances to the Plaza. Our eyes\
  \ met, a few steps away,  other times I had avoided eye contact because my prejudice\
  \ to his appearance distracted me, he greeted me as if we knew each other, I smiled,\
  \ he asked me if my drink tasted good and ask him to sit down , I invite him one\
  \ drink, his face was surprised, he asked my name and said he would play something.\
  \ He played a song and by the time he finished his drink he was already at the table,\
  \ he hesitate a bit and when I looked into his eyes I extended my hand pointing\
  \  the chair in front of me. It was like opening a Pandora's box, he told me about\
  \ his life and how his father and grandfather died when he inherited his instrument\
  \ and how he enjoys touring Guanajuato with his music. He showed me the violin and\
  \ the label, inside it said \"Stradivarius\" and nineteen hundred and something,\
  \ its wood was beautiful despite the years and the life it has led. I had to leave,\
  \ he told me that he would like to talk to me again one day and tell me how his\
  \ grandfather got the violin, told him I did not know when I would return. Two years\
  \ have passed, I usually receive calls from an unknown number and I answer them\
  \ because it can be from a charitable soul that agrees to Don Meche's request to\
  \ call me, it is always the same question: Silvina, when are you coming back to\
  \ Guanajuato?"
