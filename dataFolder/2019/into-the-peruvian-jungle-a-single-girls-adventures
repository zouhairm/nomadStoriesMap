Text: "This adventure I\u2019m about to embark on has been in my mind for 7 years\
  \ and I leave in a week.   South America on my own. Nerves are kicking in but also\
  \ excitement what will I experience, who I will meet, what challenges I could face.\
  \  It\u2019s all booked, planned and I\u2019m ready.\n\nPeru, this is where my journey\
  \ originally started I\u2019ve always wanted to visit. Cusco is a charming town,\
  \  From here I leave for my 5 day Machu Picchu trip, I\u2019ve decided not to do\
  \ the traditional trek and explore a more adventurous Mountain Jungle tour, this\
  \ includes a 40km downhill mountain bike tour, a 1 and a half day of full hiking\
  \ through the mountains, which at times this can be challenging, a white water rafting\
  \ experience and zip lining. All amazing but the true reason for my trip is the\
  \ end, Machu Picchu. \n\nWe board our coach from Agnes Caliente at 5.30am ready\
  \ for the opening at 6am. Unfortunately the weather is not great as it\u2019s cloudy.\
  \ Once the doors open we all pile in to look at this magnificent ancient village.\
  \ Due to the weather I cannot see much and I find myself walking around crying,\
  \ this was the dream destination how could it be so cloudy we can\u2019t see anything.\
  \ Finally at 10am the sun comes out, I walk up to the famous Sungate to get the\
  \ classic photo opportunity showing Machu Picchu in all its glory, finally I relax\
  \ and take it all in. I can now leave Peru happy.\n\nMy next stop is the Amazon\
  \ Jungle, I have been so excited for this experience, a lot of research was done\
  \ on finding the most unique style of accommodation.  The Tree-house Lodge is 11\
  \ individual and unique tree-houses. Getting to the Tree-house Lodge is an experience\
  \ in its own, I flew into Iquitos and was met by my lovely guide, a  1 hour transfer\
  \ will take you to the port where you will collect your  boat for the remaining\
  \  1 and half hour transfer.   I\u2019m booked into number 5 at 25ft high up, I\
  \ climb stairs and walk over a suspension bridge to reach it.  Equipped with my\
  \ own private bathroom, seating area and comfy Queen bed with Mosquito netting.\
  \  Birds Chirping and monkeys rustling in the trees you are truly at one with nature.\
  \  The serenity is amazing.  \n\nMy meals are included and I can choose any of the\
  \ activities offered by the lodge. I opt for a night Jungle cruise, Sunset cruise\
  \ with Grey and Pink dolphins, a jungle walk, visit to Monkey Island and a visit\
  \ to the local village.  My first night I do the jungle cruise and I\u2019m nervous\
  \ its pitch black I have no idea how the driver can see where he is going but at\
  \ the same time it\u2019s amazing,  we are watching for Piranha\u2019s jumping and\
  \  bird life.  \n\nHeading to the local village, meeting local people who live so\
  \ remote and basic was fantastic, the children and men play soccer the women sit\
  \ around together talking, all are so friendly, welcoming and wanting to hear where\
  \ I am from.  One of the villagers invites me into his home, no electricity, or\
  \ bathrooms but he has a pet sloth named Pablo and I jump at the chance when offered\
  \ to hold him. His Fur is hard and wiry, his nails are so long digging into my t-shirt\
  \ but it\u2019s well worth the experience, watching this amazing creature move so\
  \ slowly like you are watching him on a slow motion video.\n\nMonkey Island was\
  \ a memory I\u2019ll never forget, we take bananas and throw them to the monkeys\
  \ swinging from the branches.  From the corner of my eye I notice a Capuchin monkey\
  \ jump into the water and swim towards us, I get nervous, I\u2019m worried about\
  \ rabies and could he attack me.  The little monkey sits himself on my lap and refuses\
  \ to leave for 10 minutes all the while I\u2019m a little scared but excited at\
  \ the same time.  Finally the tour guide kindly puts him back to the water. \n\n\
  Sad to leave this journey, it\u2019s exceeded my expectations, memories I will have\
  \ forever."
