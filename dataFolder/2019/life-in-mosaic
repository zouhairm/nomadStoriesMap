Text: "The many compelling colours and light-plays bring with it an indelible sense\
  \ of discovery. So when you find yourself in Marrakech in the evening haggling for\
  \ Tagine wares, it gives you an acute awareness of interacting with life. I say\
  \ that in in light of how most people these days only interact virtually, and find\
  \ themselves at a complete loss with dealing with the reality of living in the real\
  \ world.\n\nI expected heat. I expected it to be red hot. I looked at the weather\
  \ reports before I left. I shouldn\u2019t have bothered. I happen to like the sense\
  \ of discovery. It was a beautiful kind of weather. Sunny, mild, a light breeze\
  \ that caressed your very being.  \n\nCrossroads.\n\nIt was never as noisy as you\
  \ would find it in say for example Bangkok, or Mumbai. There is a middle ground.\
  \ There always is. And Marrakech did not disappoint. With its confluence of the\
  \ Arab, African and Occidental, it makes you feel good about humanity. About life.\
  \ Especially if you\u2019re a traveller.\n\nThe orange juice stalls.\n\nAt the Jemaa\
  \ El Fna, you can find life in its entirety. Snake charmers, monkeys doing tricks,\
  \ food, delicious food, sweet sellers and a myriad other trades, smells (delicious\
  \ mixed with foul), tourists offended by the way animals are treated, tourists offended\
  \ by the way kids are treated, people (all sorts), that is a sheer fascination to\
  \ watch. What a pity then that none of the caf\xE9\u2019s or restaurants around\
  \ the square sell any wine. Wine always seems a wonderful catalyst to magical odysseys.\n\
  \nThere is something hypnotic about the late evening light creating shadows. And\
  \ the sound of horse hoofs as the carriages pass by. Traditionally dressed Berbers\
  \ (old men, by the way) trying to make a quick buck out of the tourists taking photographs,\
  \ so they could have drown their sorrows of life in drink that night.\n\nMosaic\
  \ again. Finding an old hotel at the end of the one of the busier streets that evening.\
  \ Local beer. Dutch girl. Mosaic on the walls. Travel talk. Experiences. In India.\
  \ In Thailand. In Peru. Mutual ground. Travel is always such a safe topic to be\
  \ on. It leads to such interesting things. Always a conversation starter, leader.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s one of life\u2019s rare occurrences when one meets someone in an\
  \ exotic setting and think straight away \u2018Hola, she\u2019s the one!!\u2019\
  . Then of course, it\u2019s obligatory, and one has to ask the girl if she would\
  \ like to dance. If she says yes, looking in your eyes rather that express anything\
  \ verbally, you know that dance is going to be a long one involving some compelling\
  \ sex and rock and roll. That could be construed as chemistry. And that sort of\
  \ chemistry doesn\u2019t need a catalyst.\n\nBut such pleasure were denied me that\
  \ night. There were moonlight shadows outside. A fire rose across the building from\
  \ where the hotel bar was. Then the sudden rush of fire engines and ambulances.\
  \ Crowds. Wouldn\u2019t it have been safer to keep a distance?\nIt was time to go\
  \ back to the Riad. There were other pleasure to be had."
