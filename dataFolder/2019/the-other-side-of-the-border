Text: "I carry the second worst passport in the world (Pakistan) and yet I dare to\
  \ dream of traveling far and wide. One such dream took me to my first international\
  \ trip in 2016 to the land of Kafka and Kundera. On the very first day of landing\
  \ in Prague, I ended up losing my wallet which also meant losing my passport and\
  \ my credit card. In tears and total emotional mess I arrived at the hostel in Prague\
  \ where I was greeted by rather crude staff. Just when I was sitting on the couch\
  \ in the lobby at midnight in a city that only seemed dear in the stories of my\
  \ favorite authors, I found a rather familiar looking man at the counter holding\
  \ a can of beer. Amidst my tears I didn't even realize that he was walking closer\
  \ to me until I heard the language that I recognized more than the one I\_ was using\
  \ to navigate my way in a totally new world. The guy was Indian and he spoke the\
  \ language that I refused to associate with my part of the world. You see I grew\
  \ up on the other side of the border of where he came from. He was an Indian and\
  \ I was a Pakistani, carrying the burden of 72 years of animosity. If home country\
  \ is in fact like a mother, my country was this rebellious teenager who separated\
  \ from its mother and has been trying to act like a grown-up ever since. It's been\
  \ 72 years since the bloodiest exodus in the world and we are still trying to out-win\
  \ the other, not knowing we are playing against our own selves and each of us only\
  \ seems to be losing.\n\nThe guy told me that I could sleep in his room, that he\
  \ would book another room for himself and that everything will be okay. You see,\
  \ if there was one thing I was taught while growing up, it was to never trust Indians.\
  \ I was always told that they're different, I just wasn't told how. I slept on the\
  \ couch that night only to be greeted by his face in the morning while the new receptionist\
  \ was yelling at me. He asked me if I would like to come along with him to take\
  \ a tour of the city. I was too tired and lonely to resist so I half-heatedly accepted\
  \ his offer. We kept walking around the city with very minimal conversation until\
  \ he mentioned Gujarat, the land my grandmother kept telling me stories about until\
  \ she passed. I told him how I had always wanted to visit Gujarat to look for her\
  \ long lost family. He told me how he still has some family in the South of Pakistan.\
  \ We were sitting on the stairs of an area I don't even remember but I remember\
  \ the way he looked at me and I looked at him. The distance between our home towns\
  \ was less than seventy kilometers but the distance between us was more than seventy-two\
  \ years old.\n\nWe got up and continued to explore the city until we got to the\
  \ part that was my biggest motivation to visit this city despite all the pains that\
  \ visa applications bring with them. We finally arrived at the magnificent Charles\
  \ Bridge at the sunset. He managed to grab a bottle of wine from a nearby winery\
  \ and we decided to sit by the corner and read poems to each other. For his \"if\
  \ you forget me...\" by Neruda,\_ I had \"there is a bluebird in my heart\" by Bukowski\
  \ as a response until we ended up reciting the same poems, talking about the same\
  \ poets and tearing up at the same problems. For that one night I forgot that I\
  \ was sitting with someone I was not supposed to sit with, that I was supposed to\
  \ hate him because that's what I was told to do. What I choose to remember from\
  \ that night is that we cried at the same poems, that we loved the same poets, that\
  \ we shared the same bottle of wine and that we both spoke the same language."
