Text: "While Ahmad was 14 years old, his family moved to the city due to the deteriorated\
  \ situations in the village. at first, life was very challenging to Ahmad. He was\
  \ the only one to feed his family. from 8 to 12 he was attending his school. upon\
  \ his return, he was eating at home and going out in the afternoon he started to\
  \ study English language and computer programs. while he was done with the tuition\
  \ courses than he was leaving to the brick making factory. the factory was the only\
  \ place where he was earning they money. he was working as row arranger and brick\
  \ collector at first. which is a very though job. he was returning from the at mid\
  \ night to his house. The factory was not providing any meal for the dinner. at\
  \ midnight he was preparing his food for himself. while their family members were\
  \ sleeping. after one and half year, Ahmad's life changed dramatically which brought\
  \ happiness and contentment to his life . \nAhmad finished studying the Diploma\
  \ in English Language and Diploma in Information technology and topped the institute.\
  \ the office of the institute offered him a trainee volunteer lecturer job to teach\
  \ computer subjects and English language to his fellow citizens. \nHe taught these\
  \ subject approximately for 2 years and later was appointed as head of computer\
  \ department. within 3 years he brought noticeable changes to the department which\
  \ boosted the student enrollment ratio by 40%. this achievement opened a new career\
  \ pathway for Ahmad. In open competition for a vacancy as technical translator with\
  \ United Nation Ahmad got the position and started to work for the United Nations\
  \ in 2014 in Afghanistan. he was a part time student at the collage of Engineering\
  \ and full time employee with United Nations. later his position was switched to\
  \ technical operator of computer and projects. he suggested policy changes in the\
  \ project cycle. as result, his project was nominated as unique and standard project\
  \ in All Afghanistan. this achievement has further motivated him to work for the\
  \ government. at first, Ahmad worked in a municipality as volunteer at licence issuing\
  \ authority. by the passage of the time, he studied the whole revenue collection\
  \ system. and he came up with a new way to collect revenues he converted the manual\
  \ system into an electronic system, which was communicating online with the bank.\
  \ as result the revenue for the fiscal year of 2016 has surged 33% and Ahmad was\
  \ nominated as the executive director of the municipality. and the Municipality\
  \ has received an award of 500.k $ from the president. \nby the start of 2017, Ahmad\
  \ was proficient in English language and he applied for a UK government funded scholarships.\
  \ in 2000 applicants competition he shortlisted for the interview. after the interview\
  \ he was the finalist. for the scholarship. one of the requirement of the scholarship\
  \ was to Pass IELTS or TOEFL tests with higher marks. at mean time, Ahmad was working\
  \ full time and part time to support two of his family members (Brother and Sister).\
  \ So, it was very hard for Ahmad to study and work full and part time. after several\
  \ attempts Ahmad made it possible to pass the after-mentioned tests. and he became\
  \ the finalist for those scholarships.   \nHe studied Masters of City Planning in\
  \ the United Kingdom while working at the same time to support his family. as result,\
  \ he graduated from the masters in 2018. He returned back to Afghanistan, and in\
  \ an open opportunity he was selected as vice minister of the Ministry of City and\
  \ Urban Development.  So, if we study that, at first Ahmad was a young boy who used\
  \ to take his sheep to the green grass to feed them. a worse situation made him\
  \ to depart to the city but he didn't lose his temper and commitment toward his\
  \ studies and social development. as result, now, Ahmad is the Acting minister of\
  \ the City Development ministry. So, If we want to be successful in our life we\
  \ have to work on our goals to achieve it and work for it. so, the time and people\
  \ will decide where we can work and receive a high prestigious place."
