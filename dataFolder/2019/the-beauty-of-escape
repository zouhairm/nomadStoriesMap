Text: "New York home to Peter Parker/Spider-man, Jon Bellion and the birthplace of\
  \ Frankie and Benny's\n\nLeaving the unfaithful weather of the U.K was always going\
  \ to be exciting,but I would've never thought that my residential accommodation\
  \ would be apartment on top of a local high-end Japanese restaurant (Yakitori Totto)\
  \ \n\nMy Heart had always connected with Japan since I love Anime and Manga hearing\
  \ the chef's speak and cook with such passion ignited the Naruto in me and I couldn't\
  \ help but say \"Arrigato\" meaning Thank you in Japanese. I felt so pleased being\
  \ served by such a people who inspired my childhood. The next day I decided to take\
  \ the train across the town of Manhattan and as I did so the recollection of rumours\
  \ concerning the dirtiness of New York had tried to shower me due to the cold morning\
  \ being welcomed by sour breaths of the public and demonised rats who had no fear\
  \ but my desire to enjoy the journey had guarded me and truth be told it did, one\
  \ of the main factors I enjoyed was the conversation I had with a brown skinned\
  \ lady wearing a purple jacket who sat next to me whose presence was that of ancient\
  \ sage and she began witnessing to me about the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ\
  \ and hearing the words coming off her tongue were like honey to my ears and as\
  \ she continued to talk about her life as a hairdresser in Albany back in the 70's\
  \ really helped me acknowledge the history beyond what I was seeing. The lady got\
  \ off at the sixth avenue greeting a male relative who could've been her son,nephew\
  \ or a friend it could've been anyone but they seemed like they knew each other\
  \ very well it kinda reminded me of my relationship with Grandma.\n\nAnyway I got\
  \ off at 42 st. Bryant park subway station. And as I ascended out of the subway\
  \ station all I could see was skyscraper after skyscraper connected as one all reaching\
  \ for the sky I was intimidated by the thought of a building collapsing but that\
  \ was one of anxiety trying to kerb my excitement, anyway as I walked the crowded\
  \ street of busy professionals trying achieve some kind of goal for a business firm\
  \ they never really enjoyed, a cool breeze overtook my attention and I was fascinated\
  \ by the dancing trees singing along to the wind's tune about the hidden freedom\
  \ of New York in the Bryant park and as the wind sung I interpreted it's song and\
  \ it pulled me in to enter its green paradise where I sat watching the open green\
  \ acting as an open bed to anyone tired of the rat race they called life. \n\nMy\
  \ inner child wanted to swim along that green bed for some reason but I had to get\
  \ up and leave but the desire I had grew the longer I sat there and I eventually\
  \ got up and went as soon as the dogs decided to join the party #I'mAfraidofDogs,\
  \ since it was end of October and I wanted to check out the winter village and in\
  \ doing so I found out that Northern Americans are all about showing up and showing\
  \ out, walking through the village just declared to me that Christmas was here and\
  \ that Santa was truly welcomed,the people were gathering in huge crowds getting\
  \ all festive talking about their Christmas plans and how excited they were for\
  \ the Christmas dinner, the snow whether it was artificial or not rested there on\
  \ the shops with such delicacy and each shop had intertwined lights of Blue and\
  \ Red, Green and Purple, Yellow and Red selling Christmas gifts and the like.\n\n\
  That night ended with sipping Disaronno mingled with Pepsi enjoying the male jazz\
  \ singers singing a worthy rendition of \"when you\u2019re smiling\" by \"The King\
  \ of Swing\" Louis Prima in the Birdland Jazz Club filled with people basking in\
  \ the warmth of each other's company.\n\nThe trip had ended and New York had gone\
  \ from being an place I'd only see on TV to a place where I could it my home."
