Text: "Spending some time living in Daegu, South Korea, some friends and I ventured\
  \ to the Jeongeup National Bullfighting Festival.\nAn hour of so train ride from\
  \ the city, a modest sized stadium when compared to the Spanish equivalent. In contrast\
  \ to the Spanish, the Korean version involves a scrum between two bulls with no\
  \ blood or killing on show, much to the relief of our moderate Western temperament.\n\
  \nStrolling into the venue was quite lax; circa 2011 so security was less tight,\
  \ added to the trusting nature of Korean people. Eager to see the show we walked\
  \ through the first tunnel by the entrance and took our seats. Looking around the\
  \ circular stadium, we noticed all other patrons where sitting concrete terraces,\
  \ while we had those nice plastic bucket seats. Sure enough, we had walked with\
  \ such waygook ignorance, it had been mistaken for confidence and we had accidentally\
  \ bluffed out way into the VIP section.\n\nHappy with our comfortable seats we played\
  \ along. The bullfighting started, with placed bets with each other, broke open\
  \ our cans of Cass (Korean beer) from our plastic bag of snacks, and enjoyed the\
  \ show from our front row pew. We suspected our casual attire and up-class shopping\
  \ bag would get us kicked out soon enough, but thought it best to make the most\
  \ of it. Upon reflection, we absolutely were taking advantage of Korean kindness\
  \ and resistance to confrontation, but we where just happy to have a good view.\n\
  \nThen it really kicked off, traditional Korean drums started, the whole stadium\
  \ stood up, in walks all sort of well-dressed folk. We obliged and stood, and soon\
  \ were ushered into a greeting party. We gave the patented two-handed handshake\
  \ and bow to what we where soon to find out was a mixture of a Mayor, a Culture\
  \ Minister, several foreign ambassadors, plus their entourages. \n\nI am sure from\
  \ a security/organisers perspective they knew they should have moved us, but it\
  \ had gone too far now, we where on the big screen.\nThe more I write the more I\
  \ realise what we did was wrong, and quite disrespectful to the event and the organisers.\
  \ Having said that, I do not believe I would adopt this attitude if it were any\
  \ other country, let alone my own home country of Ireland. Blaggers are looked upon\
  \ with admiration in all other circles.\n\nFrom my time in Korea, the kindness of\
  \ local people is what left the greatest impression on me. I had taken advantage\
  \ of that kindness and their well-assuming nature. I had made the most of it, and\
  \ for that, I am sorry. Sorry to the Korean people and those event organisers I\
  \ never met.\nLearned my lesson."
