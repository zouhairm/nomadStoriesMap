Text: "The hills, so close knit that the tarmac road between them looked like stitching\
  \ thread intermittent with its fabric. Small roadside posts counted down from the\
  \ current position to the destination. Now at one hundred and twenty kilometers.\
  \ The smooth tarmac road, filled with anticipation of what we are going to find\
  \ on the other side of the long stitch in this fabric. \nThe hills suddenly got\
  \ more spaced out, and the road wound down a valley, then up a hill. And there it\
  \ was, Namanga, boarder town Kenya to Tanzania. A place I had only dreamt of. Excited,\
  \ I gassed it, and charged straight for the border crossing. Like Vin Diesel in\
  \ Fast and Furious, smuggling drugs across the border. Only to have my dreams smash\
  \ into a wall at cruising speed. A border patrol officer waved the vehicle to a\
  \ halt, and asked where we are headed. And we explained we had already reached our\
  \ destination. Then came the question of a lifetime.  \n \n\u201CWhy not continue\
  \ in? Come sign in, pay customs, and drive on. You have I.D.s don\u2019t you?\u201D\
  \ he asked.  \n \nAnd just like that, a search here and there and we were in a new\
  \ country. Old currency now valueless, national language now meaningless. Under\
  \ a new flag, new tribes, new laws, new politics. Passports were not necessary as\
  \ the trading block in the region facilitated for crossing countries passport free.\
  \  \n \n\u201CYou know mom, I think I have set a new record in the family. I am\
  \ the first to drive on foreign soil. Even you haven\u2019t beaten that.\u201D I\
  \ said.  \n \n\u201CAgreed my son, but do not forget, this is my car. Before you\
  \ brag, get your own.\u201D Said my co-driver.  \n \nThe soil was red volcanic,\
  \ with a hint of brown. The hills on the other side of the boarder were more spaced\
  \ out. The roads had fewer bumps. The sun was hot, the hills were rocky and the\
  \ vegetation was scrub. We stopped at a petrol station, and never had I seen so\
  \ many digits in fuel prices at the pump. I wondered where the decimal was.  \n\
  The drive goes on, I see my first functional wooden wheelbarrow. It had one wheel\
  \ at the front, but had no supporting structures, it was simply a wooden stretcher\
  \ with one front wheel. There was no town for quite a distance. At the first stop,\
  \ I decided to buy a sim card, since my phone was set to roaming networks.  \n \n\
  \ \n\u201CHello sir, I need a sim card. How much for one?\u201D  I asked.\n \n\u201C\
  You can have one for two thousand shillings.\u201D Said the shopkeeper. \n \nFigures\
  \ like those were only thrown around in banks from where I am from. But on this\
  \ side, that is the price per liter of petrol.  \n \nAnother drive hour later, there\
  \ it was, the beautiful city, Arusha. A simple city, with simple people. The Tanzanian\
  \ flag stood tall at government buildings. The grass at the city was green and fresh.\
  \ New stations were registering on the radio. My phone finally found a steady network\
  \ signal. The air and aura in this new city is very different from what I left back\
  \ home.  \nThe region is still heavily influenced by Maasai culture. Herdsmen, still\
  \ had cattle grazing in the city and its environs. The city of Arusha is quite advanced,\
  \ but at the same time the people have found a way of maintaining culture and not\
  \ phasing it out with the incoming \u2018modern\u2019 times. \nAs I drove towards\
  \ the city, a Maasai man in his blood red shoal standing next to his drove of cattle,\
  \ numbers definitely well over one hundred, waved at me. He had a stick, from a\
  \ local shrub tree, which he held over his shoulders, and hang his hands over the\
  \ stick. His legs were crossed. His ears were pierced and he wore sandal shoes made\
  \ from car tires.  \nWhen leaving home, I expected to end my journey at the border,\
  \ now, not only did I cross it, I was in a whole new country. In addition, a whole\
  \ new city, and the only city I have ever come across that culture is still true\
  \ to its roots, regardless of modernization."
