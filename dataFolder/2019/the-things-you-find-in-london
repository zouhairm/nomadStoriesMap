Text: "London is a beautiful city with many unexpected adventures hiding around any\
  \ given corner, you must only be willing to take one of the paths less traveled.\n\
  \ I had intended on a quiet afternoon out in the city as it was a cooler summer\
  \ day and the weather wasn\u2019t superb. There\u2019s nothing that marks a dreary\
  \ summer day in England like an afternoon tea at Fortnum and Mason, where the finest\
  \ qualiTEA scones, cakes, sandwiches, and teas will brighten any skies. On the way\
  \ back from this lovely afternoon sipping tea with my mother, we happened upon some\
  \ of the police closing the roads and paths near Buckingham palace, this peaked\
  \ my interest\u2026 \nPreviously, my time wandering the streets of London have led\
  \ to some pretty extraudinary sights indcluding a tuba with flames coming out the\
  \ bell as a man played some upbeat tunes.\nWe crossed the road and decided to hang\
  \ around for a bit, we happened upon a few people just as curious as we were when\
  \ the noise of the Queen\u2019s horses and the marching band approach in the distance.\
  \ I looked at my mother with gleaming anticipation as to where they could possibly\
  \ be heading and dying to find out. My mum knows this look on me very well and just\
  \ told me to go ahead follow them and she\u2019ll catch up. I essentially ended\
  \ up chasing the Queen's band all the way down the road and as they approached Horse\
  \ Guards Parade I arrived at a ticked gate. As I gathered the information about\
  \ this event my mum soon caught up, we decided it looked interesting enough and\
  \ by the skin of our teeth, and leftover scones in hand, we were still able to buy\
  \ tickets to Beating the Retreat at Horse Guards Parade. Which is one of the most\
  \ inspiring military performances I have seen to this day."
