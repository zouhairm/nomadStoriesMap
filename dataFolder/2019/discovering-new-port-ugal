Text: "Hi! I\u2019m Leo Consul from the Philippines. I\u2019m an actor, singer, tv\
  \ presenter, book author and a cook both in Indonesia and The Philippines for nearly\
  \ 5 years now. Reading scripts and doing studio shows have somehow thwarted myself\
  \ to travel and see the world. So, this year, I decided to take some months off\
  \ to quench my travel thirst. Naturally, many people asked me the big WHY? I mean,\
  \ why not? It\u2019s when I travel that I get to experience the beauty of each place\u2019\
  s culture, the thrill of learning new things from traditions to languages, and meeting\
  \ new people. I remember when i was a little boy, growing up in a small far-flung\
  \ town in the Philippines in a very poor family, my brother would always tell me\
  \ to read books, as many as I can. He told me that it\u2019s by reading that I get\
  \ to see the world because we didn\u2019t have money to travel. Reading will take\
  \ me to places I might not be able to see. When I grew up and finished schooling,\
  \ I told myself I wouldn\u2019t let myself get contented just by reading stories\
  \ about those places that I dreamed of visiting. I\u2019ll work hard so I could\
  \ actually go to those places and thankfully, I did it and I\u2019m very proud of\
  \ that. Some people\u2019s treasures composed of fancy cars, huge houses, nice gadgets.\
  \ And if you asked me what my treasures are? Passport stamps! \U0001F601 This year,\
  \ I\u2019m starting it off in a remote Island of Batanes in the Philippines then\
  \ head straight to Cambodia. India has been a dream and I\u2019m making that happen\
  \ this year. To visit Portugal would be a phenomenal experience and I just can\u2019\
  t wait! \U0001F64F\U0001F3FB"
