Text: "On the night of 2 May 2018, she landed at the airport in Lisbon, the beautiful\
  \ Portuguese capital. She had last been on the sidewalks of the city a year and\
  \ a couple of months ago. During that time she had gone through a lot of things\
  \ and changed a lot:\n\n\"How nice to see the same thing with other eyes,\" she\
  \ thought.\n\nThe desire to return matured in her for a long time, but she did a\
  \ pretty, determined and spontaneous action one morning in April. Buy the ticket\
  \ almost as soon as the sun rises - he tried to make sure that all this was not\
  \ emotional and spontaneous, but a rational and well thought-out decision ... but\
  \ she was really excited and decided to keep the trip a secret of everyone so far.\n\
  \nShe still shared her parents just before she left, not to be angry that she had\
  \ escaped outside the country without warning them ... at least she thought her\
  \ mother would have told her. She really needed to run somewhere and herself .\n\
  \nIn the last week before his departure, there was still room to sleep - the trip\
  \ coincided with the Eurovision Song Contest, and all the rooms in the city were\
  \ reserved. This in no way disturbed her because she knew that magic was happening\
  \ in this country. Perhaps he even preferred to be so.\n\nthe escalator and in front\
  \ of it: the train ticket machine ...\n\n\"Desculpe, podes ajudar-me com os bilhetes\
  \ a comboio?\" Asked a swarthy man: she thought he was asking her how the machine\
  \ worked and he just asked her 2 euros ... how kindly on his side ... Get on the\
  \ train almost in the last minute:\n\n16:20 - as always, the king is on schedule.\
  \ I wonder where the illusion of the Portuguese is coming from is that the Portuguese\
  \ are a late nation ... their transport network is uncomfortably accurate and moves\
  \ on schedule, and all the Portuguese I know arrive at the place quite a while ...\
  \ certainly ahead of me!\n\nSantos, Bel\xE9m, Carcavelos, Estoril ... views one\
  \ of the more picturesque: palms, sands, tourists on the beaches of the Lisbon coastline\
  \ ... The train stopped on Estoril. She felt her excitement quieten, and she swam\
  \ more and more slowly through the depths of her soul. Her eyes widened, and she\
  \ felt that familiar naive look:\n\nShe was in love again and the lover was the\
  \ way again ... he had called her again to the ocean.\n\n***\n\nShe went to the\
  \ station in Cascais, where her classmate met her. They took pictures of the beach,\
  \ strolled along the paved sidewalks on the city's secluded street, and finally\
  \ drank cocktails on a terrace.\n\nWhere are you going to sleep tonight?\nI have\
  \ no idea, everything is reserved for the Eurovision.\nI will call my landlord to\
  \ warn him that you will come tonight.\nOk ... the journey starts lucky ... - she\
  \ thought.\n\n***\n\nOn a return trip they met a group of tourists who made her\
  \ sing on the train. They had a \"team building\" from their conference, and they\
  \ made them sing with a stranger on the train. They kept thinking of her as a local\
  \ resident, and she was genuinely happy about it."
