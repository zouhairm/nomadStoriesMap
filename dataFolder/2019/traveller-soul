Text: "When we travel in a new city,  the best way to experience it is to travel like\
  \ a local,  hangout where the locals do and visit all non touristy place. \n\nExperiencing\
  \ Amsterdam on a bike: Amsterdam's best experience comprises few things, one of\
  \ which includes getting around the city on bike. The city has more bikes than cars.\
  \  Additionally it will cut down your carbon footprint by reducing carbon emissions.\
  \ \n\nHanging out in Local Summer Hangouts:\nIf you are visiting Amsterdam in summer,\
  \ you will find the city really busy.  The City Centre gets too crowded, which is\
  \ more of a reason to explore places other than tourist Hangouts. People generally\
  \ visit Pllek or Roest in Amsterdam which has indoor and outdoor space where people\
  \ relax by the sea and enjoy live music. You can pack a picnic for the urban beach\
  \ or eat at the vegetarian and vegan restaurant too if you like. \n\nDrink local\
  \ Beer:\nHead to a local Pub to taste the local beer as well as international beer.\
  \ My recommendation is Cafe Gollem. This cafe stocks around 200 types of bottled\
  \ beer and 10 on tap.  Locals loves it and any beer lover will also have the same\
  \ feeling . \n\nYour Caffeine fix\nThere are many coffee shops in Amsterdam.  I\
  \ will list down the favourites of the city here - Screaming Beans is all about\
  \ quality in a cup,  they serve coffee with the finest beans of the world.  They\
  \ know it right hence this place is a regular hangout place for the locals.  You\
  \ can also try white label coffee shop or tokiho which are the other popular coffee\
  \ shop hangout places as well. \n\nLearn the language:\n\nIn Amsterdam most people\
  \ speak English but there is no harm in learning the Dutch language.  The tricky\
  \ part is the pronunciation of the words are very different from the spelling. You\
  \ may want to make sure you are saying the phrases right before you get talking.\
  \ \n\nSee You (English)  - Tot Ziens (Dutch) \n\nStroll Around in the Nature: \n\
  \nIf you love nature, you could stroll in some of the most beautiful and scenic\
  \ parks of Amsterdam,  head to Vondelpark which Amsterdam's most favourite park.\
  \ Located at the centre of the city,  it is very popular among the locals as well\
  \ as tourists especially during sunny weather days. On a bright sunny day you will\
  \ spot so many people sprawled on the grass,  relaxing with a bottle of wine or\
  \ enjoying picnic with friends.  \n\nWhile there are so many other parks to visit,\
  \ namely Amstelpark or Westerpark, I have visited Oosterpark during my last visit.\n\
  It is a famous and relaxing park visited by diverse nationalities. The park has\
  \ several sculptures and a stone in the park placed in 2005 to promote free speech.\
  \  The park makes a very interesting spot for people who loves bird watching,  they\
  \ can spot rare birds such as parrots in the wild in Western Europe,  Grey herons\
  \ and Wild ducks.  The park is very clean and a perfect spot for picnic."
