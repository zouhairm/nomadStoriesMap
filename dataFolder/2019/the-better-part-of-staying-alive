Text: "It had already been nine hours on the bus from Fes to Tangier, and there was\
  \ still no sign of a place to eat for another six more. It would take at least that\
  \ long to get to my pre-booked riad, and the bus seats were getting no comfier by\
  \ the minute, Ramadan or no. \"I'm staying right next door, I'll show you the ropes\"\
  , I remarked to the only other English speaker on the bus, \"just be ready\". Although\
  \ friends for all of a bumpy bus ride, we were now brothers-in-arms when it came\
  \ to catching a taxi.\n\nPaul, as I remember his name, had little experience yet\
  \ with the difficulties of Morocco. He'd flown straight into Fes and was yet to\
  \ appreciate the sincerity in my voice. I'd already taken the train with my best\
  \ mate Henry from Tangier down to Marrakech last week, and had successfully distressed\
  \ ourselves by attempting to purchase some of the 'premium' hash in a rapidly darkening\
  \ alley. Buying from a fellow with inch-long horse stitches from his neck stretching\
  \ from ear to ear should have tipped us off, but we had yet to learn the difference\
  \ between looking scruffy and dangerous. \n\nRealising our mistake far too late,\
  \ we'd no choice but to pay him off so he couldn't see which riad we entered. 'Stitches'\
  \ had been following us for at least half an hour by the end and Henry was not pleased,\
  \ despite the 'adventure'. Considering we had effectively been mugged for 'tips'\
  \ the night before as we were led to the backdoor of our restaurant, the only place\
  \ that sold alcohol to take the distressing edge off the heat and intensity, we\
  \ decided it was rightly time to take Morocco seriously. One harrowing incident\
  \ a week was enough.\n\nBy the time Paul and I reached Tangier he'd been sufficiently\
  \ warned. Henry had flown out from Fes, and now I was on my own. The reality hit\
  \ me fast; was my lack of backup obvious? It felt like it, and Paul had inadvertently\
  \ come to my rescue, even if I was pretending to come to his.\n\nWe reached the\
  \ bus stop in Fes, inexplicably miles from the centre of town or any nearby accommodation.\
  \ We grabbed our bags, keeping a keen eye on the bus undercarriage where the man\
  \ had thrown our bags (or survival necessities), and promptly made our way to the\
  \ taxi stand. It happened fast, as it always does, with at least six different cabbies,\
  \ or rather vintage Mercedes Benz drivers, bearing down on us loudly. They hadn't\
  \ even asked us where we were headed before three had their hands on Paul's bag\
  \ and started a tug-of-war that had him darting between them and me for sympathy.\
  \ I was prepared. I grabbed Paul's bag, yelled the name of the riad and the price\
  \ we were willing to accept (thank all the gods for online advice), and watched\
  \ as they resigned themselves one by one. Not worth it if there's no way to trick\
  \ the tourists!\n\nAs the remaining three drivers argued I moved towards the closest\
  \ of their three cars, threw our bags in, and yelled \"Ramadan Moubarak\" to many\
  \ thanks and the briefest moment of calmness needed to get in and escape. The hard\
  \ part was over, I told my newest ally, and it had gone better than I thought. Paul\
  \ was shaken, to say the least; I was utterly jaded. Fair to say we figured each\
  \ other by the time we discovered there were no seatbelts. Of course not.\n\nThere\
  \ was little doubt that I was done with Morocco. Between its heavy-handed shopkeepers\
  \ clasping you rigidly at every 'quick browse'; the labyrinthian pathways stretching\
  \ endlessly into darkness on even the brightest of mornings; the intense flavours\
  \ that permeated nostril, tongue, and clothes despite a religious inability to eat,\
  \ drink, or smoke; and the general atmosphere of danger that followed you with each\
  \ longing glare, Morocco had stripped back my securities to survival first. But\
  \ as I reached my riad for my last few days prior to Spain, done and very dusted,\
  \ it become glaringly obvious by my first drink of the night: I had rather enjoyed\
  \ myself."
