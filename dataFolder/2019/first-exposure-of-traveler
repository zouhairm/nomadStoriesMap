  \ Arabia with my mother and sibling that was told me by my mother. Then ,we come\
  \ and go there for spent vacation.then I decided to stay KSA  since 2011, I was\
  \ 16 years old that time .\n\nI never knew that it\u2019s a beautiful country because\
  \ my exposure wasn\u2019t interactive that time.But we are happy that we are with\
  \ our parents,With the passage of time country developing, every individual got\
  \ rights and me also.. \nI never noticed that it has beautiful place in different\
  \ cities \nI heard that somewhere that  you  can feel the nature of beauty from\
  \ inner feeling if you see everything with love ,you will like it .\nI traveled\
  \ north ,south ,east ,west.\nIt\u2019s mountains ancient territories , and sea side\
  \ and helped their needy families,child who can\u2019t affort the happiness because\
  \ of financial problems. \n\nWhenever I see the pictures and read the stories ,novel\
  \ that related to the sea that attracted me to go there spent whole the day there\
  \ and   sea always given me determination,fresh feeling,release  stress \nUsually\
  \ people save the money and come here now it\u2019s become a tourist country where\
  \ government gives their special attention.\n\nThis is a short part of my story.\n\
