Text: "-What are these, guys? I said, drawing my partners\u2019 attention to the thick,\
  \ grainy sand modelled beneath our feet.\n\nIt was very early in the Chapada dos\
  \ Veadeiros, 655 km^2 of immense and powerful nature; Brazilian cerrado, limitless\
  \ savannah able to regenerate your spirit with every breath. The only traces of\
  \ the man among the dry and gnarled branches of that park without order and without\
  \ end, are small paths traced to allow reaching the cachoeiras, dives of water and\
  \ rainbow light, presents of God that offer relief and freshness to the braves that\
  \ don\u2019t give up.\n\nWe arranged to meet early in the morning, me, Marianna,\
  \ my adventures companion par excellence and Fred, a kind and caring Brazilian.\
  \ We just met him the previous day in the middle of that incredible world part,\
  \ and he was already a friend, a real one. He donated his sandwiches to me and Marianna,\
  \ two brave girls a bit 'inexperienced, who decided to deal with 9km of heat and\
  \ emotions without the necessary amounts of energy and calories. \u201CWhen someone\
  \ gives you his food, he gives you his life\u201D, a friend told me when I was in\
  \ India. I can never forget it. We repaid him telling our stories, even the most\
  \ intimate and true ones, and we vowed to meet again the day after for another adventure.\
  \ We didn\u2019t expect to find ourselves in front of our greatest fear.\n\n-Footprints!\
  \ Marianna said with frightened excitement.\n-Footprints left by a feline! Added\
  \ Fred.\n\nI looked at Marianna and she looked at Fred who looked at me in turn.\
  \ The same image materialized, terrifying in our mind. Two yellow eyes murderers,\
  \ two long and sharp canines, a sinuous tail and a robust and spotted body: the\
  \ on\xE7a. None of the three dared to utter that word, almost as if, by pronouncing\
  \ it, the chances that she would appear in front of us were greater. That word,\
  \ however, resounded loudly in our mind like a threatening thunder on a day that\
  \ promised to be peaceful and you had planned an outdoor picnic.\n\nI didn\u2019\
  t know what the exact translation of the term on\xE7a was, perhaps jaguar or perhaps\
  \ panther, but she is the queen of the forest. Surely, the on\xE7a is an animal\
  \ that when Brazilians tell you about, it doesn\u2019t seem to be of this world.\
  \ A supernatural creature, an invincible feline that doesn\u2019t\u2019 leave escape.\
  \ Silent, fast, she can swim and climb; if she attacks you, you cannot run away.\n\
  \nWe were all paralyzed.\n\n-Guys, I cannot go on, I just cannot do it - I said.\n\
  \nOur journey could have ended there. The on\xE7a had taken over our minds and our\
  \ minds no longer gave orders to our legs. We only felt our hearts beating hard\
  \ and our stomachs, our stomachs burning.\n\nThen Fred gathered all his courage:\n\
  \n-We cannot defeat the on\xE7a. It\u2019s true. However, we can trick her. If we\
  \ get very close, we raise our arms, all together, and we shake them, screaming\
  \ and moving forward, then she might think that we are an animal bigger, scarier,\
  \ stronger than her. She will run away. The on\xE7a attacks man not because she\
  \ is evil, but just because she is hungry.\n-He said, appealing to his Brazilian\
  \ culture, still linked ancestrally to the wildest nature.\n\nFrom a terrible threat,\
  \ the on\xE7a came back into my head to be just a being of the creation.\n\nThe\
  \ on\xE7a is fear, the greatest and more real of man's fears, the one that the man\
  \ is forced to face daily. Daily he devotes a fleeting thought to it and then he\
  \ comes back to attach to his life and moves forward, always and in any case. If\
  \ we let ourselves be overwhelmed by it, going on will not make sense anymore, nothing\
  \ will make sense anymore. However, if we keep on walking, aware of the risks but\
  \ also of the ways we have to cheat them, we could enjoy the prizes that the beauty\
  \ of the world offers us every day.\n\nWe held each other. Our shoulders touched\
  \ and our hands tightened. We were ready to face the on\xE7a. That was how we continued\
  \ our journey."
