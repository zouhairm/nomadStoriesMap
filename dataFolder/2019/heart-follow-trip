Text: "One day I woke up and I was thinking why I should be in place where I like\
  \ less?? And that was a big city life, if I liked to be in nature and place where\
  \ is nice, full of good air and nice colloured flowers. I did not find any possibility\
  \ to work in Czech Republik and so I packed all my bags and leave a bit in hectic\
  \ way, but anyway, I could not find any compromis with my teacher in Czechland and\
  \ so full of disgutting feelings left.\nThere are two stories that I want to include\
  \ in this funny stories and I want to start with the first.\nThat \"one\" days came...after\
  \ two hours of being on the sky with grey clouds and windy torrents I got to the\
  \ green fields with many birds that circulate and move on sky up and down next to\
  \ my dreamt cows, animals. I was in the middle of the ocean, meeting many of bigger\
  \ blond persons, with blue eyes. They had whiter color of the skin and some they\
  \ had pigments on it. Every days i thought that I would come back to Czech and do\
  \ something else, but i couldn't as on that time I did not know nobody that is really\
  \ carying for animals, just only I met persons at the university that not agree\
  \ with my thoghts and ideas. After these funny time I started to sing at work and\
  \ has discussions with my employer from Island. But I liked that work, even if I\
  \ would expected that something would be different. Somebody could write, maybe\
  \ my younger collegue: \"the work was quite the same and you cannot speak to noone\
  \ at the work place, cause nobody was there, just cows. For me was not \"just cows\"\
  , for me they were more important, that work has for me a bigger significance.\n\
  It was not true that every day was same, many things I discover in the freezing\
  \ climate with the snow covering the ground and many of that high tops of the mountains\
  \ that a person in comparation with a nature is a real ant that does not has strong,\
  \ only with a help of the others things can change, the sadest thing is that not\
  \ everybody can change and do good things for many of that reason that has not sense\
  \ to explicate now. By the way, I wanted to change place and go on some hottest\
  \ place, where is not so cold and so my second trip that I made it was in direction\
  \ of South, close to Africa, but still Europe, Spain. Before I reached this hottest\
  \ place I was passing throught to many of problems but also adventuror funnies time\
  \ in Swiss, by their green reach valley with cows outside, the best city of Luzern,\
  \ that amased me, but I have to escape to France, where I saw a part of my family,\
  \ cause Swizerland has a different economy and it's a lot expensive. The others\
  \ cities I saw, it was Vaduz, very small green, smart, with modern architecture,\
  \ but unfortunately not so far from the famous top of the city, where is situated\
  \ the castle, I could see many industries. Anyway, the best adventure starts in\
  \ C\xE1diz, after I was able to cross all the Spain. There I cross of the for city\
  \ in the night to reach a hostel that does not exist. Before I was in Cordoba and\
  \ I met one American, that after escape from me to Thailande, but I was very sad,\
  \ cause I think he could be the right one, but no worries, I met in Nerja, where\
  \ the persons live in countryside in caves and a lot wild, without cars, most of\
  \ the time without houses, one boy from Togo, and there it was when starts a real\
  \ stressfull but a lot adventuror life!! I left the car and start to walk and live\
  \ wild, until the day I have reached San Pedro, where I decided to leave this kind\
  \ of life and go in a house again, where I am now, in \xC1guilas, with one Maroccan\
  \ boy relaxing and thinking what I will do next, cause it seems that in comparation\
  \ this boy won't to left me, but unfortunately most of the time we speak by using\
  \ hands and drawing, cause I do not know Arab and he does not speak English. Even\
  \ if I am not that kind of person who would go only to work and back to sleep, now\
  \ cause of my mind and feet need it, after 3 months here I recollect on this way\
  \ many of the plastics, glass and things in the countryside, so as an environmentalist\
  \ I did something for the nature, I received a lots of recommandations and have\
  \ a possibility to grew wild, learn a lot, have free times, but now I would prefere\
  \ maybe to work for a while for after start to travel again."
