Text: "I first tried to jump when I was five and nobody taught me, but last vacation\
  \ someone has taught me how to that. Last January was the biggest trip I\u2018ve\
  \ ever done in my life. I went to three places in full one month. Two islands in\
  \ Indonesia and one city in Malaysia. Two places with beaches and one place with\
  \ city life. Bangka. Bali, and Kuala Lumpur, three different type of places that\
  \ have big influence to myself. \n\nThe heavy rain welcomed me in Bangka, my first\
  \ destination. Dima, I just landed in Bangka and it\u2019s heavy rain. Will be there\
  \ one hour from now. I sent a text to my friend who I stayed with. Okay. He replied\
  \ shortly. He is originally from Russia and staying for a couple of months in Bangka.\
  \ I grabbed a taxi then went straight to his house. \n\nI heard an island named\
  \ Bangka, but never thought I would visit that place. Every morning for twelve days\
  \ Dima always took me around the village by bicycle. Beach, the main place we visited\
  \ everyday. More than five beaches we had been to, but the most beautiful and less\
  \ people we always spent the rest of the day together was Pantai Matras. Ten minutes\
  \ by foot and no people on weekdays. \n\n\u201CCome on, take your shirt off and\
  \ let\u2019s jump into the waves!\u201D shouted Dima from the sea.\n\n\u201CWhat?\
  \ Do you want me to die? I can\u2019t swim!\u201D I answered loudly.\n\nHe laughed\
  \ at me and said, \u201CNooo, just jump when the waves comes and you\u2019ll be\
  \ fine. Let\u2019s go!\u201D \n\nI took my shirt off then jumped into the sea. The\
  \ waves came and I jumped same as he showed me. That was fun!\n\nThe typical of\
  \ beach in Bangka that never found in other places was the big stones. Almost every\
  \ beach has big stones. Watching sunset on the stone with waves as the backsound\
  \ was my favorite thing in Bangka. \n\nThe stars and the moon were watching me asleep\
  \ through the window on the plane. I landed in Bali in the midnight. My cousin\u2019\
  s boyfriend picked me up at Ngurah Rai International airport. Late night riding\
  \ with motorcycle in Bali was not bad. Hot, it was my first impression to the island\
  \ of the Gods. Bali has a lot of beaches as Bangka. I found other beautiful sunset\
  \ on this island. \n\nPandawa beach, Sanur beach. Kuta beach, Seminyak beach. Seseh\
  \ beach. Those are some of beaches with beautiful view, but the most beautiful one\
  \ was Seminyak beach. Sunset was always give its best smile at 18:30 to every person\
  \ who watched it. Everyday for twelve days I went to the beach for sunset in Bali.\
  \ The waves, the wind, and the sand were my bestfriends on the beach. \n\nFor the\
  \ second time the stars and the moon were watching me asleep on the plane. Night\
  \ flight to Kuala Lumpur, my last destination of my trip. It was my first time to\
  \ Kuala Lumpur. I stayed in two places, first was near Chinatown and the second\
  \ one was in Cheras, a little bit far from the central city. Walking in the big\
  \ city and using public transportation are the common things in my hometown, but\
  \ two things that makes me impressed to this city were the cleanliness of the city\
  \ and the awareness of the people to every rules in public transportation. \n\n\
  Visiting three places in full one month was not my plan, but it happened because\
  \ of my curiosity of places, people and local wisdom. The diversity is not a problem\
  \ in society. It makes me as human learn and know that this life is beautiful. This\
  \ trip has taught me that this planet is full of magnificence, not only about the\
  \ nature, but also the people."
