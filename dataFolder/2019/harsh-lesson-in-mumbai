Text: "\u201CDon't ever stop for anybody or anything here in Mumbai or anywhere else\
  \ in India. Because no one will wait for you!\u201D Niki scolded.\n\nNiki's willowy\
  \ stature and girlish voice contrasted comically against the blunt words she bestowed\
  \ upon me. It would have been hilarious if an incoming car hadn't almost hit me.\n\
  \nNiki was escorting me to the Gateway of India so I would be able to take the ferry\
  \ to Alibaug, a sleepy resort town.\n\nBut on my way there, I froze, momentarily\
  \ stunned by Mumbai's frenetic traffic. The aroma of street mixed with cattle ordors,\
  \ the blare of car horns, and the hazy smog was overpowering. The oppressive heat\
  \ created a sheen of sweat that plastered my clothes to my body like an uncomfortable\
  \ second skin. The strap of my duffle bag cutting into my shoulder.\n\nThe sensory\
  \ overload caused me to halt midway into oncoming traffic. Until Niki had intervened\
  \ and tugged me to the other side of the road.\n\nThe hand grasped on my left wrist\
  \ was reminiscent of a mother holding a child's hand while crossing the street.\
  \ It served as a stark reminder of my obliviousness leaving me flustered and foolish.\
  \ \n\nDespite my initial self perception of bravado-- there was plenty I needed\
  \ to learn. My worldliness was not extensive as originally thought.\n\nIt had been\
  \ an extravagant few days in Mumbai-- I was shown the inside of a cricket club and\
  \ taken to sit in restaurants. My over eager picture taking was tolerated and looked\
  \ upon with bemusement. I hadn't realized up until that point how protected I was\
  \ from the more grittier and hectic elements of Indian city life. \n\nUpon reflection\
  \ I understood how accommodating and gracious my host had been during my stay in\
  \ Mumbai. It was admittedly an embarrassing awakening to have after almost get struck\
  \ by a vehicle.\n\n\u201CDon't ever stop for anybody or anything here in Mumbai\
  \ or anywhere else in India. Because no one will wait for you!\u201D\n\nThe cacophony\
  \ of excessive honking and reeving of engines played like a soundtrack to this sentiment.\n\
  \nWhen I first arrived in Mumbai, I recalled a female pedestrian getting into argument\
  \ with a driver. Her bright green sari gleamed as her hands slapped angrily against\
  \ the hood of the car, berating the driver for refusing to stop for her. I realized\
  \ that this display of assertiveness and aggression was necessary in daily life.\n\
  \nAs Niki continued to lead me to the ferry near the Gate of India, her hair billowed\
  \ behind her, chic attire unscathed, she appeared unperturbed by the incident. I\
  \ was overwhelmed with the sense of farther displacement at my own naivety as I\
  \ got on the boat. I needed to be more bold and assertive even while walking down\
  \ the street.\n\n\"Welcome to India! It was nice meeting you\" Niki blurted cheerily\
  \ as she heaved my duffle bag at me.\n\nI caught the bag with a grunt but not before\
  \ it knocked me in the solar plexus.\n\n\"Thanks!\" I wheezed, hoping country life\
  \ in Alibaug was a bit more mellow. But heeding to Niki's advice I wasn't expecting\
  \ it to be much easier."
