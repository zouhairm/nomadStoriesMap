Text: "Have you ever tasted Guava Jelly? It's not your everyday spread. It hasn't\
  \ got the sweetness of strawberry jam or the sourness of marmalade. It's got a tangy\
  \ flavor and when spread over a hot buttered toast it becomes ever so sweet.  Whenever\
  \ a relative or friend goes to India and asks what I would like them to bring back\
  \ I always ask for several jars of Guava jelly. It might seem strange to associate\
  \ jars of jelly with a place like India. When most people picture India they think\
  \ of a place full of elephants, brightly colored saris and three-wheeled auto rickshaws.\
  \ Many veteran travelers associate the country with massive amounts of garbage,\
  \ overcrowded public transportation, and the odd cow creating a rush-hour traffic\
  \ jam. \n\nI associate India or specifically Delhi with my great aunt's homemade\
  \ guava jelly jam. I was seventeen years old the first time I visited New Delhi.\
  \ Having spent my entire life in Vancouver, I had an out-of-body experience arriving\
  \ at the Indira Gandhi Airport in New Delhi. Coming from a cultural melting pot\
  \ it felt strange to suddenly be in a sea of brown bodies. I wasn\u2019t yet used\
  \ to the ceaseless noise pollution or strange scents of the capital. On the car\
  \ ride to my great aunt\u2019s home I found myself unable to pay attention to anything\
  \ the taxi driver was saying. I was far too engrossed with my surroundings. We drove\
  \ past the Qutb Minar, the Red Fort, Lodhi Gardens, and made our way over to Vasant\
  \ Vihar. This specific district was home to many foreign diplomats and it was in\
  \ this area that my great aunt bought a house many years prior. My great aunt was\
  \ born shortly after World War Two and has lived in Delhi for over fifty years.\
  \ She's seen the city evolve from under British colonialism into a post-Independence\
  \ political hub. She\u2019s watched Old Delhi and New Delhi grow side by side, and\
  \ her identity is very much an amalgamation of both. She dresses in traditional\
  \ saris but speaks fluent British English. She serves a full English tea every morning\
  \ even in 45 degree heat. It was strange to me to see this contrast but until that\
  \ point I had never visited a country that had been colonized. It was a strange\
  \ experience. \n\nI spend ten days in New Delhi with my great aunt. Every morning\
  \ I'd come to breakfast and she'd have had her cook lay out a full spread and there\
  \ was always homemade guava jelly. Over tea and toast we would go over my itinerary\
  \ for the day. I'd tell her I wanted to see Old Delhi, check out the local bazaars\
  \ like Chandni Chowk and Sarojini Nagar. She'd debate with me. Ask me why I wanted\
  \ to go to these overcrowded areas, why I wanted to try dirty street food, and haggle\
  \ with ethnic jewelry vendors. She wanted me to stay safe. Visit the more cosmopolitan\
  \ areas, try out the trendy new Italian restaurant in Khan market and shop with\
  \ all the other tourists at the \"cleaner craft bazaar\", Dilli Haat. \n\nI desperately\
  \ wanted an authentic experience. Even though we bickered about it I wanted to see\
  \ India without its western influences. I wanted to try papdi chaat (yogurt and\
  \ chickpeas street food) and south indian dosas. I wanted to walk through the gullys\
  \ (alleys) of Old Delhi and explore the city\u2019s Muslim Quarter.\n\n It was scary\
  \ at first to travel alone as a teenager but it was also exhilarating. We often\
  \ think of travel as a luxury and assume that it has to be a comfortable experience.\
  \ I like to think of travel as experiential learning. You have to lean into the\
  \ discomfort. \n\nIf I had listened to my great aunt I would have stayed in the\
  \ cleaner areas of cosmopolitan New Delhi. But part of seeing a new place is seeing\
  \ every part of it. The old and the new. I got food poisoning halfway through my\
  \ trip. For the remainder of my time in Delhi I could only stomach guava jelly on\
  \ toast. Guava jelly will always reminds me of Delhi because it was the first time\
  \ I really learnt how to travel."
