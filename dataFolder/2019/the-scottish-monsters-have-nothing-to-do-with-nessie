Text: "\"Meet me at The Scott Monument.\" I read the message again and I asked myself\
  \ if I was really about to go. I knew where the monument was. That was the first\
  \ place I visited in Edinburgh, the next day I arrived in Scotland. I was still\
  \ at work, so I had to be fast. \"See you there.\" I replied and, until I went home,\
  \ in the evening, I forced myself not to think about it.\n\nI was working in a hostel\
  \ for the summer, in order to make some money quickly for the rest of the year,\
  \ when I was a full-time student. I didn\u2019t have a lot of free time, but in\
  \ the next evening, I was sitting on a bench next to the Scottish monument of Sir\
  \ Walter Scott, thinking that if he would only knew, he would come back to life\
  \ and start laughing or composing a short poem about it. After a little while, he\
  \ showed up. We were both smiling like teenagers and we were both kind of shy. We\
  \ started to walk around and suddently we were in his car, going over Forth Bridge,\
  \ while I was seeing what a real Scottish sunset looks like \u2013 nothing but monstrously\
  \ beautiful.\n\nHis mom was Australian, but she moved in Scotland after she fell\
  \ in love with his father. She loved Scotland so much, she learned all its places\
  \ by heart. Then, she decided it to share it with others, so she became a guide.\
  \ At the middle of september, I ended my contract a week before I was supposed to\
  \ go back to Romania, so James planned a trip. We were supposed to follow this little\
  \ map his mom invented for us. It was an unique map of Scotland, full of places\
  \ that aren\u2019t usually visible on the official maps. We had some sort of mission,\
  \ as we were calling it: to visit those places she discovered in her tours.\n\n\
  Our trip was going to last around four days and I was laughing all the time we were\
  \ speaking about it, because everything sounded like a cheap movie scenary. On the\
  \ first morning, while we were driving to Fort William, I was making just stupid\
  \ jokes. My jokes and laughing stopped soon, when we started to get closer to the\
  \ Highlands. The mountains, the little lakes with their water so clear that you\
  \ could even see your toughts in it and the shapes of the castles you could just\
  \ randomly see here and there. \"Who\u2019s living in there? A princess? A king?\
  \ \" James ignored my question and started to speak, like a true guide-son, what\
  \ he knew from his mother about everything that surrounded us. \"Actually, in that\
  \ one, there is still living a princess.\" He shut my mouth so I just didn\u2019\
  t say a word for about one more hour. I sat there watching through the window, while\
  \ he was explaining carefully all he knew about every single place and I felt monstrously\
  \ lucky.\n\nWhen we arrived at Fort William, we spent about half day walking around\
  \ the shore of Loch Linnhe. The locals were fishing, couples were walking holding\
  \ hands and a guy scared us while he was coming out of water from what it looked\
  \ like a snorkeling session. On the other side of the city, the tourists were walking\
  \ around the small mountain-city streets and the silhouets of those who were probably\
  \ hiking were moving slowly in the distance.\n\"I kept Nessie for now, because I\
  \ tought you should see real Scotland first.\" And he was right. I saw the curly\
  \ forest road, the waterfalls and the small lakes that were surrounding the big\
  \ one. All of them had their magic and their monsters. But they were good monsters;\
  \ not scarry, not horrifying. I kept them with me, since I saw them, and when I\
  \ finally arrived to Loch Ness and looked around for Nessie, I realised Jmes showed\
  \ me already all the beautiful monsters of Scotland. There was nothing left to see.\
  \ And the ones I saw had nothing to do with the ones everyone there was looking\
  \ for."
