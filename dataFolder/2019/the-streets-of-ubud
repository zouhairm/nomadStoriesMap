Text: "The true beauty of Ubud is hidden within its people. \n\nI can never forget\
  \ the moment when the waitrons at MyWarung, sang for me on my birthday and gave\
  \ me a slice of cake and wrote \u201CHappy Birthday Nolo\u201D on the plate?\n\n\
  Ibu Jero, who on my first day in Ubud ,convinced me that it was safe to take a motorbike,\
  \ when I insisted it looked dangerous and would never do it, she was wearing a helmet\
  \ and I wasn\u2019t.\n\nKetut, who at night, drove me to every mobile shop we could\
  \ find and helped me to look for a wireless remote shutter. I had lost mine earlier\
  \ that day somewhere between battling a monkey and being followed by a dog.\n\n\
  \                                                                          ***\n\
  \nI stopped to buy ice cream just outside of The Monkey Forest Sanctuary.\n\nI had\
  \ plans to go to the Pura Dalem Ubud later so I also stopped to buy a sarong. \n\
  \nI was carrying the plastic bag with my sarong in it when a monkey jumped in front\
  \ of me, yes, a monkey, on the streets.\n\nMy two hands were juggling my phone,\
  \ the plastic with my sarong, my bag and the spoon I am using to eat my ice cream.\n\
  \nThe animal dived for my sarong, I could not let him have it; I had plans to go\
  \ to the Temple in the morning. I ducked, it only managed to scratch the bag. \n\
  \nThe rascal went for the hand that had ice cream in it, managing to knock it out\
  \ of my hands and it landed on the road.\n\nWe both dived for the ice cream and\
  \ the little rascal got to it first. It has speed advantage. It grabbed it and ran.\n\
  \n                                                                             \
  \   ***\n\nWhat is it with animals in Ubud and plastic bags?\n\nAfter my encounter\
  \ with the Ghetto Monkey. I stopped for 2 glasses of wine. \n\nMy maps app had estimated\
  \ a 24 minute walk back to my hotel; I decided to walk.\n\n10 minutes later, the\
  \ app estimated a 38 minute walk to my hotel; I must have missed a turn.\n\nThe\
  \ street lights had come on, I got a bit nervous but I continued walking.\n\nI met\
  \ a dog. It decided to follow me. \n\nI had just fought a monkey, I did not have\
  \ the energy for this.\n\nIt seemed to take interest in the plastic bag I was carrying,\
  \ it kept sniffing at it.\n\n15 minutes later, I stopped to check if I was still\
  \ on the right path, my app estimated a 55 minute walk back to my hotel. \n\nI kept\
  \ on walking, pretending that I was in control, the damn dog is still following\
  \ me. I yelled \u201Cvoestek\u201D a couple of times; language barrier, it did not\
  \ even flinch.\n\nI was now walking in an area where there were no houses or shops,\
  \ there were bushy trees on both sides of the road.\n\nI came across a local who\
  \ had stopped his motorbike on the side of the road.I waved, crossed the street\
  \ over to him and asked him to take me to my hotel.\nThe animal never followed me\
  \ across the street \u2013 problem solved.\n\nAs a rule in Bali, you must negotiate\
  \ the price. I didn\u2019t even try. This young fella had 100% negotiation power.\
  \ I agreed to the first price he asked for.\n\nI clung onto him like a chameleon\
  \ clinging to a tree branch, he squirmed a little; I had no plans to loosen my grip.\n\
  \nHe stopped shortly afterwards and asked that we use my phone to navigate to the\
  \ hotel. Panic set in, it was because of this app that I was in this situation in\
  \ the first place. \n\nHe stopped again a few times to check the app, every time\
  \ he did this I got worried. I no longer had faith in that app.\n\nIt was dark.\
  \ I was scared to check the time.\n\nEventually I heard the words \u201Cyour destination\
  \ is on the right\u201D.\n\n \u201CHere is your hotel,\u201D Wayan confirmed.\n\n\
  The best parts about travel are the unplanned moments. Ice cream connected me to\
  \ a monkey, a plastic bag connected me to dog, which connected me to Wayan."
