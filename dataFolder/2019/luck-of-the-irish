Text: "The early evening air was as warm as the famed Irish hospitality. It had been\
  \ an uncommonly sunny and dry few weeks on the Emerald Isle and the Irish people\
  \ were soaking up as much of it as possible. It was day two of my three-week stay\
  \ in Greystones and the thrill of exploring a new town and eating at The Happy Pear\
  \ had me downright giddy with excitement. I set off from the local b&b and ran smack\
  \ dab into a handsome Irishman in the driveway.\n \nOver a month of traveling abroad\
  \ solo led up to this chance meeting in the driveway. After selling and donating\
  \ 80 percent of my belongings, I quit my corporate job, and left Los Angeles\u2014\
  my home of nearly a decade. I was embarking on what some might call a life changer.\
  \ Years of hard work, a few wrong turns, and an unfortunate company buyout, had\
  \ shot me straight into a dead end position at my job. And as much as I adored the\
  \ Southern California weather and would miss my tight-knit group of friends, I knew\
  \ that I needed to make a radical change if I was ever going to begin growing again.\
  \ As both a writer and a human.\n \nSo I booked a one-way ticket to Iceland, with\
  \ a three-month itinerary that included Scotland, the Czech Republic, and almost\
  \ two months dedicated to roaming Ireland.\n \nThose first seven weeks flew by.\
  \ I learned what it means to be truly, solely alone in a foreign country. I learned\
  \ how to get out of my comfort zone, meet new people, be perfectly fine eating dinner\
  \ in a pub by myself, how to navigate European transportation, and to be content\
  \ in silence. By the time I dragged my tiny suitcase down the pebbled lane in the\
  \ quaint Irish town of Greystones, intent on finding a b&b, I had transformed into\
  \ the most confident version of myself. That was when I met Richard.\n \nWith clear\
  \ blue eyes that reminded me of the nearby sea and a thick Irish accent that had\
  \ me both charmed and somewhat confused, I knew that I\u2019d met someone quite\
  \ special. We agreed to meet up at the local pub when he got back from helping his\
  \ father on the farm over the weekend.\n \nThe pub was adorned with old books, clocks,\
  \ antique furniture, and an entire wall of whiskey. We sat on a sofa and drank for\
  \ four hours. Never drink with the Irish\u2014they will remain sober, while you\
  \ become outrageously sloshed. When the pub closed, we crossed the street and walked\
  \ along the beach at midnight under the stars. It was all very dreamy. He was an\
  \ utter gentleman and never in my life had I been on such a romantic date.\n \n\
  After that, we spent every day together exploring and talking for hours. Thankfully,\
  \ I became better at understanding all his Irish-isms (i.e. going on a session,\
  \ ending sentences with \u2018like\u2019, and saying \u2018away with ya\u2019 anytime\
  \ a compliment was uttered.) I was smitten. Richard embodied every quality I had\
  \ ever wished for in a man, and then some.\n \nFriends joked that I would meet my\
  \ husband while traveling, and for a moment, I thought maybe they were right. Three\
  \ weeks of time spent together turned into a seven-month long-distance relationship.\
  \ We made plans to see each other, but a rather unfortunate (or perhaps fortunate)\
  \ cancellation of my flight near Christmas led to us eventually breaking it off.\
  \ He was in the middle of getting his masters in environmental science and I was\
  \ still immersed in my life changer\u2014bouncing from place to place, even when\
  \ I came back to America. We both agreed the timing was bad.\n \nRichard was my\
  \ first real relationship and I think I was falling in love with him. To this day,\
  \ he is still the best man I\u2019ve ever met. Sometimes we meet people thinking\
  \ we\u2019ll spend the rest of our lives with them, and other times we meet people\
  \ only for a short time who leave a lasting mark on our hearts. Saying goodbye isn\u2019\
  t always easy, but if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn\u2019t change a thing."
