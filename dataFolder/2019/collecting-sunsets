Text: "Never, in a million years would I think I'd be right there, in that moment.\
  \ And nothing prepared me to live something so special.\n\nI was told once that\
  \ change was the solution to our problems. As a child, I discovered that travel\
  \ was the solution to my problems, since then, I travel to live, I travel to forget,\
  \ I travel to think and I travel to remember.\n\nThey say that the journey is part\
  \ of the destination. Believing this, our trip begins in the preparation of it.\
  \ All those sensations, the feeling of packing, getting on the road, or getting\
  \ on a plane are one of the most addictive feelings I've ever experienced.\n\nI\
  \ love a road trip, nothing better than getting the car and drive, feel the wind\
  \ on our face, the smell and everything. So the trip from Teresina Piau\xED to Jericoacoara,\
  \ about 7 hours drive, was not a problem at all, just the anxiety of arrival that\
  \ made me uneasy.\nThis is one of those trips that you can witness a little that\
  \ Brazil offers you. Going from a city totally in the dry, \"epoca da queimada\"\
  \ (season were the weather is so hot, that the vegetation catches on fire, literally)\
  \ and your destiny is a paradise beach, full of vegetation and beautiful blue sea.\n\
  \nJeri, as it is known by locals, is a hard-to-reach beach, where it passes sand\
  \ dunes and an easy path to get lost. We had an ordinary car, they said that we\
  \ needed a 4x4, but we decided to take a chance and go with our own, we hired a\
  \ guide who followed in the front showing the way. The dunes are a little high and\
  \ long, with slim sand, making it very easy to get bogged, and that's what happened\
  \ to us, we jammed the four wheels, we simply drove the car halfway down the wheels.\
  \ as access is difficult, so call for help to untying our car was big problem, and\
  \ no one would come. So It took 8 people shaking the car and pushing to get the\
  \ car out of the hole. Nothing better than an improvisation on our trip right?\n\
  \nJericoacoara is a private beach, perfect for those who want to relax and enjoy\
  \ themselves, a few inns and hotels. Local access is remote and wonderful restaurants.\n\
  \nThe largest and most beautiful dunes is a stage to watch the sunset. Where the\
  \ sun goes down and the kitesurf gives a show.\n\nJericoacoara has one of the most\
  \ beautiful sunset I have ever experienced, where the sun sets in the sea and forms\
  \ a watercolor of shades of yellow, orange, red, blue ... besides the beauty that\
  \ It provides me, but the feelings of tranquility and the privilege that surprised\
  \ me the most.\n\nThat's why our lives are based on the moments collected. The memories\
  \ of food tried for the first time, the salty smell of the ocean, the details, Jericoacoara\
  \ is a memory of the moment of my fingers tucked into the soft sand, warm by the\
  \ strong sun, the taste of the best 4 cheeses risotto, the company, a surreal landscape\
  \ and a clear blue sea, which to me, born in the south, unfortunately is something\
  \ more difficult to see. But that's another story.\n\nJeri is one of those beaches\
  \ that makes you thankful for the opportunity.\n\nAnd we added another sunset to\
  \ our collection."
