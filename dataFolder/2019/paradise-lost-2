Text: "In the summer of 2014, my fianc\xE9 and I landed in Serbia. Nearly forty years\
  \ ago her grandparents ran away from this homeland. Not because of war, but for\
  \ love. They assumed a harsh journey that ended on the rusty plains of South Australia\
  \ where they mined opal with other immigrants. Today, the affluent country they\
  \ left behind no longer exists. Yugoslavia lives now only on the covers of their\
  \ fading blue passports and in memory. Our desire was to reconnect with that family,\
  \ but it wasn\u2019t that easy, Serbia is a complicated place. Much has happened\
  \ since the implosion of the Yugoslav state, not much of it good. \n\nConsumed by\
  \ the eclectic structures of fallen empires, I found Belgrade to be a gritty bastion\
  \ of urban art, cuisine, and grunge bars. Yet, amongst a renaissance of European\
  \ tourism, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the traces of war that still haunt this\
  \ magnificent city. Anti-NATO graffiti riddles its central boulevards and downtown,\
  \ bombed-out buildings are commonplace. The more outspoken locals call the aerial\
  \ assault on the Serbian capital in the late 90\u2019s, \u2018the American Holocaust\u2019\
  .\n\nOutside Belgrade, we drove into the rolling hills that resembled the Italian\
  \ countryside, and found our way to a red brick house with a sprawling vegetable\
  \ garden, where we met her Grandfather\u2019s family. We were strangers, but her\
  \ uncle hugged us with a broad, tearful grin. It was hard not to feel like family\
  \ here. Over a pint of yogurt and grilled meat we discussed life in Serbia. It became\
  \ clear that the Balkan wars had crippled Serbia for a generation, and life has\
  \ been hard here ever since. In just a few hours, lubricated by what had to be rocket\
  \ fuel, I grew to love these proud people, and laughed endlessly at their wicked,\
  \ dry humour. I could see the joy on my fianc\xE9\u2019s face as we nestled into\
  \ the warmth of these kindred spirits. She had discovered her brothers, kind and\
  \ generous, and ultimately her people. \n\nAfter a week of laughing and sightseeing,\
  \ in what is now my favourite city in the world, we eventually set off to Ni\u0161\
  \ in Southern Serbia. We pulled up to a charming house that was decorated with flowers,\
  \ and woodpiles were stacked against a picket fence. This was the home of her grandmother\u2019\
  s family. We entered a smoky room of cigarettes and swooping grins, boisterous singing\
  \ and greetings in broken English. Soon, dozens more people arrived from all over\
  \ Serbia to toast our arrival. Huzzah! It was both heartwarming and overwhelming.\
  \ As the drinks flowed, we soon discovered that her grandmother\u2019s family was\
  \ originally from Kosovo, and I could see a silent mourning in their eyes when it\
  \ was mentioned. \n\nThey had lived in Pe\u010D, an alpine region in northwestern\
  \ Kosovo; that holds many similarities to modern day Austria, and on one unforgettable\
  \ day: men with assault rifles walked into their village and demanded they leave\
  \ or die. Generational homes were abandoned and livelihoods erased in an instant.\
  \ They fled to Montenegro, others to Ni\u0161. And yet the Serbian love for the\
  \ province may never go away. Kosovo represents the ancestral cradle of their zealously\
  \ defended Orthodox faith, and many regard its loss as a dagger to national pride\
  \ and cultural identity. Kosovo is a partisan issue in Serbia, as it certainly must\
  \ be in Albania, but amidst the rhetoric, it was the civilians who lived in community\
  \ for generations that lost the most - Orthodox and Muslim, Serbian and Albanian.\n\
  \nWe wanted to connect with my fianc\xE9\u2019s family and we succeeded in a profound\
  \ way: we feel connected to the pain and desires of the wonderful Serbs that took\
  \ us into their homes but we also discovered an untouched country of beauty, art,\
  \ and history. Many, like my fianc\xE9\u2019s grandparents, prefer to remember an\
  \ idealistic version of Yugoslavia, one of peace and unity, rather than the tinderbox\
  \ of ethnic states ultimately doomed to failure. I don\u2019t blame them; their\
  \ country no longer exists, nor does their home. They experienced a world when Kosovo\
  \ was just a beautiful place to live and their neighbours were simply, Yugoslavs.\
  \ Both are paradises lost to time."
