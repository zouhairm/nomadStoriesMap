Text: "Last fall, I went to Amsterdam on a long-awaited trip with my husband, two\
  \ siblings and their significant others.  Each year, we go to a new destination\
  \ for a little exploration, connection and R&R (we have five kids between us). \
  \ The importance of these trips grows with each passing year\u2014the new places,\
  \ the inside jokes, the memorable experiences, the changes that we feel when coming\
  \ home\u2014they are worth their weight in gold as we head into middle-age.  \n\n\
  Amsterdam had been high on my travel list since I found out that I had Dutch blood\
  \ in my veins back in elementary school. You suddenly discover that you are \u201C\
  from\u201D somewhere and immediately form a kinship with that place.  It\u2019s\
  \ nothing new, really\u2014it harkens back to our innate desire to feel a true sense\
  \ of belonging. My grandmother was born in Amsterdam and traveled with her parents\
  \ by boat to Ellis Island in the 1920s. I never met her\u2014she had passed decades\
  \ before I was born\u2014but being in the place from which she hailed instantly\
  \ connected me to her and those that came before her.\n\nIn Amsterdam, we spent\
  \ our days drinking Dutch beer, walking the canal-lined streets, biking through\
  \ Vondelpark, taking in the sights and sounds of the city.  We rented a boat to\
  \ cruise the canals ourselves, an intricate framework of one-ways and low bridges\
  \ that glide you past four-story rowhouses\u2014at their feet, scores of bicycles\
  \ on cobblestones streets. We ate farm-to-table at a restaurant made entirely out\
  \ of shipping containers. We filed in to see the famous works of art at the Rijksmuseum,\
  \ ate Dutch pancakes for breakfast and cradled fries in paper cones from stands\
  \ on the street. \n\nThe city came alive to me, as cities often do when you are\
  \ from suburbia. I found myself aching to be anchored in such a beautiful place.\
  \ We walked from one end of the city to the other, my family chatting away behind\
  \ me.  But I was up ahead and in my own world.  I touched the brick walls, dragging\
  \ my open palm across them and heard a voice say out loud, \u201CI feel most like\
  \ myself here.\u201D It had come from me but where had it come from? What did it\
  \ mean? Did I feel most like myself in Amsterdam or in this blissful state of travel?\
  \ In this state of constant movement, of raw wonder and curiosity?\n\nI often feel\
  \ like a sleepy part of me comes alive when I travel. The part of me that clings\
  \ to the monotonous routine and comfort of everyday life sort of slides away and\
  \ in its place, I feel a newness, an acute sense of the world around me, a poetic\
  \ kind of self-discovery. I felt it happening then in a way that I hadn\u2019t before.\
  \ \n\nTravel changes us, we know this from experience, but it\u2019s hard to ascertain\
  \ just how.  It can be quiet, almost stealth-like where we don\u2019t see the change\
  \ in ourselves until well after we\u2019ve returned home from the trip.  But sometimes,\
  \ if we\u2019re lucky, we have a front-row seat to change in us. We travel for so\
  \ many reasons but I think this is biggest of all\u2014how will we come back changed?\
  \ What will we have experienced that will transform us? \n\nTravel encourages us\
  \ to open ourselves up the world around us.  It plucks us from our quiet, repetitive\
  \ existence and plants us right down in the middle of the unexpected and new. It\
  \ begs of us to be adaptable and accepting, to be willing. Willing to let go, willing\
  \ to try\u2026willing to see, help, roam, explore. Willing to go in the first place.\
  \ \n\nWe don\u2019t find ourselves\u2014our true selves\u2014in the predictability\
  \ of everyday life. We find ourselves in the moments when we are outside of our\
  \ shells just long enough to look back and say, \u201Coh, there you are\u201D."
