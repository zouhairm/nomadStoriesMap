Text: "I was a dedicated runner; not necessarily the fastest but I was obsessed. I\
  \ meticulously tracked mileage using a GPS watch, hydrated incessantly, performed\
  \ complicated pre-run rope stretching routines, and ran through the streets of my\
  \ native New York City with an intensity and focus bordering on neurotic. When I\
  \ decided to travel to Nicaragua for the summer at age seventeen, I planned to take\
  \ my training with me. I packed my running shoes, enough gel packs to last a lifetime,\
  \ and boarded my flight to Managua (only after assuring the TSA officers that my\
  \ muscle roller was not, in fact, a weapon).\n\nSure enough, a few days later, my\
  \ feet were pounding along a quiet, paved roadway on the volcanic island of Ometepe.\
  \ I ran down a steep hill towards the beach, dodging potholes and fallen mangos\
  \ and soon fell into a trance along the glimmering lake, running until I reached\
  \ a small shack selling freshly caught fish before pausing and turning back. Days\
  \ later it was the cobblestone streets of Estel\xED I explored, turning down colorful\
  \ streets backed by the breathtaking mountainous landscape of the northern highlands.\
  \ Training was going spectacularly.\n\nOne morning, my travel group was set to embark\
  \ on a three-day trek through the mountains tracing a route used by rebels fleeing\
  \ the dubious Somoza dictatorship in the late 1970s. That same morning, as we boarded\
  \ the back of a pickup truck to drive to the trailhead, my stomach began to show\
  \ its first signs of disapproval. By the time we reached our campsite for the night,\
  \ a remote coffee plantation, I was horribly sick. Unable to keep anything down,\
  \ I refused dinner and went to sleep quarantined in a small toolshed wrapped up\
  \ in as many wool blankets as I could find. \n\nWhen the sun rose, I was still weak.\
  \ The plantation\u2019s owner, Don Julio, offered me a small cup of coffee and some\
  \ lemon juice to quell my stomach and I decided I would attempt to continue on the\
  \ trek. Bad idea. An hour and a half into the day\u2019s hike I was nearly on the\
  \ verge of collapsing. At this point, I decided my body had had enough, and that\
  \ despite my stubbornness, I should seek medical treatment. I felt defeated, exhausted,\
  \ and miserable; unable to hike, unable to train, unable to run.\n\nAfter retracing\
  \ my steps back to the plantation with the help of one of our group leaders, I was\
  \ surprised to be greeted by Don Julio himself. \u201C\xBFSigues enfermo?\u201D\
  \ I nodded my head yes. Immediately, without hesitation, he hung up a hammock between\
  \ two poles, fetched a glass of water and sliced up a bowl of fresh vegetables.\
  \ Despite having just met the day before, his concern was genuine and comforting,\
  \ like a parent unto a child.\n\nShortly after, a leader from one of the nearby\
  \ communities offered to drive me all the way back into the Estel\xED town center\
  \ in the back of his pickup truck. Bumping along the uneven dirt path through remote\
  \ villages we stopped frequently along the way to offer rides to sweat-soaked farmworkers\
  \ carrying heavy loads of fresh produce on their backs into town markets; everyone,\
  \ no matter how tired, bearing smiles and radiating warmth. \n\nOne IV treatment,\
  \ a case of Powerade, and several days later, once I had regained my strength and\
  \ was ready to return to the group from what turned out to be a nasty case of salmonella,\
  \ I boarded a public bus and headed back into the hills. At the first stop I watched\
  \ curiously as a young girl handed a large sack of animal feed to the driver. With\
  \ ease, he hoisted the bag onto the top of the bus, strapped it on with rope, and\
  \ resumed driving. Over an hour later, the bus pulled up to a worn, wooden gate\
  \ from which a man and his daughter emerged and received the sack. I seemed to find\
  \ hospitality at every turn. \n\nWhen I returned to running on New York City streets\
  \ nearly a month later, I turned a corner, was almost hit with a car door, and was\
  \ cursed out by the driver. Ah to be back."
