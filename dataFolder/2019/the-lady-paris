Text: "Paris is far. Couples who cant solve their problems should be forced to take\
  \ this non-stop flight; because when you sit next to someone for 15-hrs, you will\
  \ have to like them or listen to them. Or kill them.A 15-hr non-stop flight feels\
  \ like taking the wrong turn to Canaan. It\u2019s endless. The plane stops being\
  \ a vessel, it starts being an extension of the passengers.\nYou sleep, you watch\
  \ a movie. You eat a mini burger. You wait by the washroom. You read. You sleep.\
  \ You wake up. You stare out the window at the heart of blackness. You ask your\
  \ seat mate if they grew up being hugged. You watch a movie, stop halfway and watch\
  \ a cartoon. You giggle. You order another drink. You giggle louder. You walk down\
  \ the darkened aisle, past the rows of snores and someone saying in their sleep,\
  \ \u201Cplease don\u2019t let my flower die.\u201D You tell a cabin crew - Keziah\
  \ - \u201CI know you, you are my boy\u2019s pal.\u201D You wait outside the washroom.\
  \ Repeat.\nI read and finished a whole big book, an autography of Mohammed Ali,\
  \ (Ali: A life.) where Don King is described as \u201Ca 50- carat setting of sparkling\
  \ vulgarity and raw energy, a man who wants to swallow mountains, walk on oceans\
  \ and nap on clouds, a black Machiavelli of the streets.\u201D I read that twice\
  \ and I sucked on the words like a toddler on a nipple.\nIt\u2019s coming to 7am\
  \ in Paris but my body clock is just before lunch hour in Nairobi. My body clock\
  \ is back in the office, at my desk asking Fred if he carried any snack from home\
  \ to share and him saying no and my body clock saying \u201Cseriously, how come\
  \ the wife never packs anything for you anymore? Is the love fading?\u201D Outside,\
  \ Paris  hums with sirens. It\u2019s surreal. Surreal that maybe Samuel L Jackson\
  \ could be in this same city. Even more surreal - and terrifying - that Toni Braxton\
  \ could. I have come so far and come so close, Toni. Free me from this angsty teenage\
  \ slavery or I will fall on my own sword of words, you big Apple of my eye, and\
  \ put a brutal end to this unrequited love\nParis? Paris is a lady. And today she\
  \ is wet. Wet and very cold. It\u2019s raining, that deceptive light drizzle that\
  \ will soak your boots. Leaves are falling off trees. Women walk hunched under black\
  \ umbrellas. Men cup their hands to light cigarettes under le v\xE8lum and doorways.\
  \ I saw a boy behind a window looking at the streets below; cheeks as pink as a\
  \ flamingoes tail. You dont see anyone\u2019s hands; they are either thrust in pockets\
  \ or in gloves. Small cars crawl through narrow streets like beetles seeking mating\
  \ partners. Black clad figures in scooters weave through traffic rushing to cups\
  \ of steaming coffee and french kisses. There are no birds. Winter is coming.\n\
  Because Paris is the euphemism for love I thought I\u2019d see people kissing on\
  \ low bridges. In my imagination everybody in Paris holds hands, men sing for women\
  \ on balconies, nobody drinks wine, they sip it, men have hairy knuckles and women\
  \ have thin smiles and they laugh with their heads thrown back and say \u201CEsp\xE8\
  ce de vilain coquin, toi!\u201D In the books I have read about Paris, foreplay is\
  \ a national culture.\nBut even in this glum weather, you feel Paris\u2019s intention.You\
  \ know she will surprise you. She will say something sultry like \u201CTu vas rester\
  \ l\xE0 \xE0 me regarder ou tu vas enlever ce pull de p\xE9p\xE9.\u201DTo mean,\
  \ \u201CAre you gonna just sit there staring at me or are you going to get out of\
  \ that grandfather sweater"
