Text: "It is a story that I felt when I came true a dream which dreamed for years\
  \ after saw a picture of one Annapurna on the internet a long time ago.\n\nI walked\
  \ Annapurna circuit for 18 days including exit and entry to Nepal and crossed the\
  \ maximum 5416M Thorongra. I have met many things on the road, mountains, valleys,\
  \ flowers, Yak, horses, stone and river and peoples who live in the mountains. The\
  \ day before my return to Korea I visit Pashupatinat.  \n\nWhen I looked back to\
  \ those days after a certain period of time, I felt that I did not have any memories\
  \ left for mountains, flowers, or roads. It's just people's lives that are in my\
  \ mind and come closer to me. It's just people who have nothing to do with me. What\
  \ remained most intensively is death. The text I wrote after the trip was about\
  \ the road that passed, but the conclusion was people. The following are the conclusions.\n\
  \nPashupatina is a Hindu temple but with a crematorium on the banks of Bagmati,\
  \ the tributary upstream of the Ganges River. It is designated as a World Heritage\
  \ Site. \nYou can also see the pictures here on the banks of the Bagmati River,\
  \ the upper tributary of the Ganges, a sacred river that passes through Pashupatina.\
  \ Pashupanat's Nat means 'temple', Pashup Party is one of Shiva's names, Fache is\
  \ 'Life' party\n\nIt means 'dignified existence'. Devout Hindus regard their wish\
  \ to wash their body in the Bagmati River. When it is time to die, it is said that\
  \ it is cremated after it comes to death to come here.\n\nNo matter how you listen\
  \ to Shiva, it is a complicated and far-reaching story to tourists who are not Hindus\
  \ in fact. Rather, I may be looking for Pashupinath to see the deaths that have\
  \ been completely blocked in my life. There are various types of funeral rites in\
  \ the world. Mainly the natural environment and religious precepts of the area have\
  \ the greatest influence on the funeral customs. \nIf you look at the ritual of\
  \ funerals, you can see that the body is returned to earth, water, fire and wind.\
  \ The body in the wind. Some dry to wind, some burns a body to fire, some a body\
  \ to give a bird to a bird, many are buried in the soil.\n\n Our lives are not thrown\
  \ away by the cold breaks of death, but by sunlight, wind and water, and into another\
  \ life. Being able to soak in warmth is comforting to those who have not yet died.\n\
  \nThere are not many crying crews, and many of the family members are far away,\
  \ and the workers are burdening the body. No matter how powerful he was and his\
  \ honor was high and he has many goods, what he occupies after death is to burn\
  \ the body. Below are three layers of firewood stacked vertically and horizontally,\
  \ two layers of firewood on top of the body, and wet straw stitches for burned and\
  \ abandoned. To burn well, a guy stir bamboo firewood piles. The body that was burned\
  \ and turned into ashes and it just flows along the water. And after a while, another\
  \ corpse will be in place.\n\nThere are many small buildings with white roofs are\
  \ where the people waiting for death. Here in Shiva temple. It is a place filled\
  \ with hearts that want to die and cremate and flow to the sacred Ganges. In some\
  \ cases, the body is better and the life is extended again. In this case, it changes\
  \ its name in the sense that it has got a new life, and it returns from this place.\n\
  \nThank you for being born again by Shiva.\nIt was a precious time that it was hard\
  \ to meet while living. I was comforted by seeing the life and death of those who\
  \ passed by.\nIn Buddhist expression, it is called a very good karma.\nMemories\
  \ that are not necessarily sad ... But I miss those times that I feel like I will\
  \ get sick if I get too depressed.\n\nThe stars of longing were in the mountains,\
  \ and they were people and their lives."
