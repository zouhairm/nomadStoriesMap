Text: "\u201CWhiskey cola please\u201D - a middle-aged woman with golden stars on\
  \ top of her nipples hands a mug to me. I am working in a bar - I pour drinks in\
  \ the middle of the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. It sounds a little bit absurd -\
  \ like everything at Burning man.\nIn America you shouldn\u2019t call blacks - niggers,\
  \ and Burning man - a festival. That sounds like an insult to the annual attempt\
  \ of universal efforts to create an alternative reality. In this psychedelic brew\
  \ there are all elements of a real city - post office, hospital, airport, cinemas,\
  \ cafes and spa centers. Here there are official marriage registrations and laser\
  \ eye surgery.\n\LOne of the main principles here is gifting. People are staying\
  \ on the road and provide soup and pancakes, give out ice cream and watermelons.\
  \ All this they bought and brought to the desert at their own expense, just to share\
  \ with others.\n\LIn this atmosphere of universal love and care, a desire to give\
  \ something and make people happy is borning. On the wave of this impulse hours\
  \ of volunteer work is what you started to desire. But you dont lose time at work\
  \ \u2013 it is also part of the desert life.\n\LAt Burning man something is always\
  \ going on. There are so many events that you do not need to chase after them. They\
  \ will find you. There is no main stage and no main event. The center of what is\
  \ going on \u2013 it is always yourself. Wherever you are, something happens to\
  \ you. And from this there will be created your personal experience - for which\
  \ people come here. \n\LPeople come out of the sand, talk to you and disappear as\
  \ soon as you blink. It is very difficult to meet the same art-car twice and the\
  \ same person twice. If this happened, it means - Playa provides. It is the local\
  \ religion. \n\LA feeling of a permanent holiday never leaves the city. All people\
  \ are smiling and hugging, exclaiming \"enjoy your burn!\" And \"welcome home!\"\
  . In every camp plays its own DJ. And all this music merges for you into one track,\
  \ when you ride along the road on a bike. Throughout Playa objects are scattered\
  \ chaotically. The most important are the Man and the Temple. Man stands in the\
  \ heart of Playa as the main landmark. And the Temple is in the deep Playa - a bit\
  \ away from the city.\nThe silence in Temple is deafening. On the wooden walls people\
  \ write about their loved ones who have passed away. Photographs are looking at\
  \ me from of each of the walls. As well as the inscriptions. I think that burning\
  \ man is the most impressive party on the planet, compared to other club parties\
  \ which are more like matinees in kindergarten. But I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ that the heart of this holiday of life is pain.\n\LPeople all around have a different\
  \ skin colors, language, sexual preferences as well as attitudes towards drugs.\
  \ They can walk naked or in shorts with a unicorn - but inside everyone there is\
  \ this pain. The same as yous. And the Temple is the place where people open it\
  \ to each other. The atmosphere here feels like at cemetery. But in the cemetery,\
  \ everyone's emotions are directed inwards, and then - outwards. And that's why\
  \ it's a temple. A temple of a religion common to the whole world - love.\n\LOn\
  \ the last day of the festival, the Temple burns. Tens of thousands of people watch\
  \ this huge fire. Everyone is silent. \u201CLive brightly and leave no trace \u201D\
  \ - another principle of the Black rock city - a city that exists 8 days a year.\n\
  \LBurning man is when 70,000 people simultaneously decided to escape reality. It's\
  \ not just a big party - it's a cosmic world with its own laws. There are not as\
  \ many naked people as you think. It's not just the electronic music. Here, not\
  \ only orgies and drugs. Here everything is not what you expect. And how - depends\
  \ on the result of the chemical reaction between you and the white dust of this\
  \ magical city."
