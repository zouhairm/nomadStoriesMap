Text: "Our backpacks were ready, we should reach the harbor by dawn, I thought. The\
  \ harbour is located 78 km from our town. We took a bus at 2 AM. The ferry only\
  \ has one scheduled in a day. It\u2019s very crucial that we can\u2019t miss it.\
  \ \nThe ship was loud, crowdy and dusty. Cars, buses, trucks and motorcycles were\
  \ entering this ship. There were many people who carried groceries, vegetables,\
  \ fruits and other basic food. The whole situation reminded me of a traditional\
  \ market. At 6.30 AM this big boat finally departed and for the next five hours,\
  \ we were stuck in this sea, the Java Sea. \nWe were hundreds of marine science\
  \ students. We were always going to places but we never went this far before, to\
  \ the island of Karimunjawa. We had planned this trip for months. We will be going\
  \ into some part of these unpopulated islands for our study, yet we know that it\
  \ was merely a travelling. \nKarimunjawa is one of the perfect islands for marine\
  \ conservation in Indonesia. Mangroves and coral reefs there are still perfectly\
  \ healthy. Its only about 71.2 km2 in size, but it also has 27 little islands surrounding\
  \ it. \nThe temperature was 38\xB0 C when we arrived. We were tired, but as soon\
  \ as we realized what was there, we thought the journey was worth it. \u201CWow!\u201D\
  \ My mouth opened for a few seconds. \nBlue. It was the purest blue color that I\u2019\
  ve ever seen. I came from a big city where I can\u2019t see such a holy scene. It\
  \ was a mesmerizing view.\nThe next morning, we packed our equipment and took several\
  \ small boats to the Cemara Kecil Island. It took about half an hour. As I took\
  \ my first step, I can feel how desolate this island was. It has the cleanest sand,\
  \ a small pine forest and silence, except for the sound of waves. We decided to\
  \ do a Coastal Clean-Up that we never did before. I thought, why do we have to clean\
  \ this barely touched island?\nWe divided ourselves into five groups according to\
  \ the type of the garbages that we need to clean, plastic, paper, fabrics, glass\
  \ and iron. We highly doubt that we can get these all kind of garbages at first\
  \ though.\n After walking on the seashore for around five minutes, my group found\
  \ several plastics. We use plastic everyday and everywhere around us, so it was\
  \ easily carried by ocean currents. What about fabrics? No one lived here and this\
  \ island was far away from the main island, so I assume that the fabric group would\
  \ not find anything. \nSurprisingly, the fabric group finally found something after\
  \ 15 minutes. They first found a lousy backpack, then after that, they keep finding\
  \ a ripped out shirts, pants, underwears, a whole pillow, dolls and some unknown\
  \ object. The whole kind of plastic, paper, glass and iron that we collected were\
  \ kept getting heavier and heavier. We never expected this would happen in this\
  \ beautiful place. After circling this small island, we gathered the sack of the\
  \ waste and weighed it. 350 kilograms! A shocking number for an island that is only\
  \ as large as one and a half hectares.\nI never expected that this could happen\
  \ to this hidden paradise. I know that the oceans are always moving. The patterns\
  \ of currents that moved all of this trash were never really gone. If one place\
  \ was polluted such as big cities, all kinds of environment in the world would have\
  \ the impact. Our trip has taught us many valuable lessons. We had traveled to many\
  \ places but it is only now that we become aware of something that we didn\u2019\
  t realize that we have underestimate."
