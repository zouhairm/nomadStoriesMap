Text: "One of the things that I'm taking longer to adapt here in Italy, are the windows.\n\
  \nMy apartment has several of them.\nNot just normal windows, but huge ones.\nAnd\
  \ I live in the middle of a small village, full of buildings and no space between\
  \ them.\n\nThis taught me that behind every great window, is a great granny - very\
  \ curious about the neighbors' habits.\n\nI came from Brazil.\nThere, we have lots\
  \ of space and just love to open the whole house to let the air in.\nWith me, is\
  \ no different. \nI always keep everything open.\n\nWich is clearly bringing me\
  \ many of embarrassing moments here.\n\nFor example, just now. \n\nThere I was.\
  \ \nIn a beautiful moment of empowerment and vulnerability, wearing my green clay\
  \ mask and a shower cap full of penguins, sitting in the toilet and practicing my\
  \ italian pronunciation by reading the daily horoscope, aloud.\n\nSo far, everything's\
  \ ok.\nNo shame in making our time in the bathroom worth it. \n\nBut it turns out\
  \ that, for me, the idea of having a big window in the middle of the bathroom, strategically\
  \ positioned for people follow this \"real life Game of Thrones\" was so bizarre,\
  \ that I just didn't realize that I not only had this big window, but also, was\
  \ the joke of that episode.\n\nLiterally six meters from where I was, there was\
  \ my sweet and lovely neighbour, Mrs. Margherita, watering the plants. \n\nShe smiles\
  \ and say something like: \n- \"Ohhh bella! Non preoccuparti com me! \nHai una bella\
  \ pronuncia!\"\n\nAt that moment, I understood.\n\nThat' s how Italians start the\
  \ most honest relationships ever."
