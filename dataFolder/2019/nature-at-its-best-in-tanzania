Text: "Star gazing on a crystal clear night in Tanzania. We saw Venus the brightest\
  \ star next to Jupiter, and the faint pink Mercury star completing the triangle.\
  \ It was a magical night. Who knew it would be the start of an exciting family trip\
  \ in Africa!\n\nWe chose this destination primarily to see the solar eclipse, so\
  \ naturally we were staying in a remote area. Although it was so isolated I was\
  \ amazed to have the comforts of hot water and wifi. Where else can you hear the\
  \ phrase \u201CThe elephant pulled the wires out so we have no wifi!\u201D \n\n\
  I loved the safaris. It was beautiful to see wildlife in their natural habitat.\
  \ Although it required a lot of time and patience, it was definitely worth every\
  \ second! I did not expect it to be such an exhilarating experience though, as our\
  \ safari cars had no doors or windows. We saw crocodiles eating a dead hippopotamus\
  \ and a lion sunbathing on the grass. It was so close I could have patted the lion\
  \ if I reached my hand out! There were so many memorable moments. We had a rare\
  \ sighting of a leopard climb up a tree to its prey, just a few metres from our\
  \ car. We also witnessed a buffalo run, escaping from eight lions and bravely running\
  \ back to its brothers. I was cheering the buffalo on, quietly hoping that it would\
  \ survive. At the end of its run, the buffalo was panting and breathing hard. It\
  \ definitely gives a whole new meaning to running for your life! Like humans, animals\
  \ have their own personalities as well.  We had an elephant charge at us, as if\
  \ we were too close and in its personal space. We saw the evolution of life and\
  \ the survival of the fittest on these safaris. Totally unscripted and completely\
  \ unforgettable!\n\nOur primary reason for visiting Tanzania was for the solar eclipse.\
  \ It was a clear and magical day, surrounded by giraffes. At that pivotal moment\
  \ of darkness, there was a calmness. Time stood still, and even the wildlife paused\
  \ as if they knew something special was happening. It was definitely a case of mother\
  \ nature at its absolute best.\n\n\nOur last few days were spent at The School of\
  \ St Jude. A school that is free for children from very poor families. I was part\
  \ of a volunteering organisation that donated AUD$1000 many years ago, for the provision\
  \ of clean drinking water. For this reason, I have a special connection to this\
  \ place. An Australian, Gemma Sisia founded this school with only $10 and named\
  \ it after the patron saint for the hopeless. This place definitely gives people\
  \ hope. The motto of the School is \u201CRespect, Responsibility, Honesty, Kindness\u201D\
  . From this vision, there is a sense of community and positiveness from the students.\
  \ There are so many inspirational stories on how this place has changed the lives\
  \ of the children, their families and even the staff. The visitor coordinator, Felix,\
  \ had an amazing story. Having tried six times and four different ways to get a\
  \ job at the school, his persistence finally paid off after securing a position\
  \ as a bus driver. His strong desire to keep learning saw him learn English words\
  \ from students during the bus rides. They even gave him homework! However, he wanted\
  \ to learn more than just words.  He eventually got promoted to visitor coordinator\
  \ where he was able to develop sentences and practice his English. He is the perfect\
  \ example of how persistence pays off and a constant reminder that we should never\
  \ give up. We also visited one of the student\u2019s home. Her mum was so warm,\
  \ welcoming and so grateful to us. Seeing their living situation was definitely\
  \ a very humbling and emotional experience for me. They are a great example of how\
  \ we should appreciate and be happy with what we have. \n\n\nTanzania has far exceeded\
  \ my expectations. I definitely did not expect such an emotionally driven and eye\
  \ opening experience. So blessed to be able to go with my family who travelled from\
  \ all over the world. A memorable trip where mother nature and human nature were\
  \ at its best!"
