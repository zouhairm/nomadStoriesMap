Text: "One sunny day in October, i finally made decision to travel alone with no friends\
  \ or family member and no plan to visiting anybody I knew. It was a spontaneous\
  \ journey to went and saw beautiful island in my country that had been mesmerizing\
  \ most people around the world, Bali. This island of god is on my top list as it\
  \ provides a combination of natural beauty, uniqueness of the culture, and traditional\
  \ delicious food. \nThis was an important exploration for me as I had never been\
  \ exploring a new place alone before. Raised in the violence situation within family\
  \ since childhood, that kind of condition often kept me in fear for years of life\
  \ and hold me back long enough not to having clear picture of who I am and what\
  \ I want to do in life.\nI arrived in Denpasar and spent around one hour went to\
  \ Ubud by car.  There was a  nice little villa in the midst of Banjar Sema Payangan\
  \ village.  On the way to my staying place, I could see the beauty of green and\
  \ layered paddy field. The next morning, after took a good rest, I went to first\
  \ destination \u2018Campuhan Ridge Walk\u2019. When did a walking approximately\
  \ 3 kilometres on trackway surrounded by greenery and hills with unlimited blue\
  \ sky above my head and the smell of fresh air, my soul was elevated to the new\
  \ dimension of life which was \u201Cthe freedom\u201D. It was a moment when I felt\
  \ became myself, and find new identity, courage, strength, and vision about life.\
  \ \nAfter a long walk, I stopped by in a cafe nearby and drank pure coconut water.\
  \ It was relaxing moment sitting there while my eyes spoiled by the view of rice\
  \ field illuminated by the sun and lotus pond around the cafe. At other traditional\
  \ restaurant or \u2018waroeng\u2019, I tried mixed rice Bali - one of culinary heritage\
  \ - consist of rice, some different kinds of chicken cooked in traditional spices,\
  \ and served with vegetables, and chili. Mixed rice or \u2018nasi campur\u2019 is\
  \ a modern version of \u2018nasi yasa\u2019 which was made for Hinduism ceremonies,\
  \ and symbolizing  the prosperity. I was enjoying and appreciating my meal, as for\
  \ me it was a cultural heritage served on a plate.\nI chose rice field as my next\
  \ destination on the second day. Stepped onto the foothpath nearby the rice field\
  \ was a compulsory activity for me when visiting a village. I saw some Balinese\
  \ mother wear the traditional costume, harvesting the paddy, and several women checked\
  \ the condition of plants. Most women here are the backbone of their family. I was\
  \ glad could see daily activities of people in different region and had time to\
  \ say hello to these hard working women.\nOn my way back to the villa at noon I\
  \ ever had a chance to see Balinese did praying ceremony together in \u2018pura\u2019\
  \ - Hindu temple. They usually bring \u2018canang\u2019 - a plate made from young\
  \ coconut leaves which contains flowers in multiple colour. It was interesting to\
  \ seeing and meeting people from other beliefs here and it was fostering a love\
  \ of diversity in my heart.\nIn the evening before leaving Bali, I spent my time\
  \ at Bale Bengong - a traditional gazebo in front of my villa - and was trying to\
  \ contemplate the days I went through here. Through my trip, I found that I started\
  \ to love myself despite all the unexpected things I went through on my past and\
  \ had the boldness to stir up my dream again. I was hoping that women outside there\
  \ who had been facing violence in their life could arrived at same point as mine.\
  \ Then finally I got a new definition of my life that \u201Cmy life is a compelling\
  \ journey aimed to embraced every single moment in the way of appreciating myself\
  \ and others in various form of diversity wrapped in the beauty of nature\u201D."
