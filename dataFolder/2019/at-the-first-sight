Text: "Tuesday, 29th January 2019, I had not realized I would go on a trip the next\
  \ day. As the same time, I was excited about it. I had never gone to Natal, a city\
  \ from the northeast of Brazil, and I would like to know a beach close to it called\
  \ Pipa. This trip would be my first solo travel and guess what? By bus. Yeah! I\
  \ would face around 22 hours by road on a bus, not so comfortable, but I was expecting\
  \ for the best. \n\nWednesday, 30th January 2019. Finally, my day trip. So anxious\
  \ for the unknown, glad to have this opportunity and burning inside to get to know\
  \ a different place, diversity of culture and people. And it is exactly what it\
  \ was. Diving myself in a world that I did not know yet. The bus left around 7:50\
  \ pm from the bus station, my parents were there to give me a see you soon. But\
  \ it would be a really fast trip, anyway, they would like to be there and it was\
  \ good. Parents in these moments are kind of butterfly seeing their daughter flying\
  \ to see the world outside. \n\nWhen you are about to take 22 hours by road you\
  \ need to be ready for the bored time. Watching the landscapes through the window,\
  \ sleeping some time, trying to listen to some music (until the cellphone die),\
  \ thinking about whatever came in my mind and so on. 2 am and we stopped at Aracaju,\
  \ for my surprise a guy took a seat by my side and pull out the bit of my comfort.\
  \ After I would thank him for the chat we have with another guy who was straight\
  \ at our front. It was a chat for more than 4 hours. We talked about everything.\
  \ Cities we were from, and gaze, we were from the same, what the reason for our\
  \ trip, about climate, beaches, trips, and etc.\n\nTime to say goodbye for the guys\
  \ of the bus and follow my way to Pipa\u2019s beach. All the route was overgrown\
  \ of such amazing views. Coast of Brazil, is like that. Just arrived at Pipa I walked\
  \ to my hostel, named Zicatela Beach Hostel. So cozy place, people from all over\
  \ the world there. Argentina, most of the guests, Israel, Sweeden, Germany, and\
  \ Brazil, of course, who said that Brazilians doesn\u2019t travel inside our own\
  \ country? Uh? It was moments of exchange of experiences with the travelers who\
  \ were in the hostel. Joys, doubts, hardships, difficulties, but in the end, learning\
  \ has always been the word of motivation to continue to travel.\n\nThen, two days\
  \ were gone, I would have to travel back. Time to catch a bus to Natal, because\
  \ the bus would leave on Sunday, at 9 am. And again, another first experience doing\
  \ Couchsurfing. It was incredible. I would never think that it would be how it was.\
  \ Ana hosted me one night and called her friends to go out with me. We went to a\
  \ little restaurant next to her house to have some food and drink, we talked, talked,\
  \ and talked about trips, wishes, experiences. We came back around 1 am, after enjoying\
  \ a lot. I had to wake up at 5:30 am in order to go to the bus station. At the time\
  \ I got there I realized how much I was blessed to could enjoying moments like those.\
  \ Hoping to travel again and write down my feelings and experiences to share the\
  \ world what we have to know from the other, the unknown."
