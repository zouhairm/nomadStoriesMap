Text: "It's a story about the time when I was in my 10th grade, the time when every\
  \ kid is filled with a bucket load of excitement and curiosity to explore the outside\
  \ world. Before we get started, I just want to let you know that our principal was\
  \ the cheapest individual on the planet. \n\nIn the middle of every academic session,\
  \ we students can go for a trip with designated faculty of the school. So, we all\
  \ demanded a trip to Manali or Pachmadi, but our chintzy principal wouldn't allow.\
  \ He put forward a restriction that we cannot afford going outside of the state\
  \ because it will turn out to be a week-long trip, and also due to pre-boards were\
  \ approaching he was kinda right on point. So, we ended up with a destination two\
  \ hours away from our hometown - Jatmai & Ghatarani. As soon as that day's bell\
  \ rang, we munchkins rushed to our home, packed our bags, and were ready for an\
  \ upcoming two days adventure.\n\nThe next day as soon as our bus got into motion,\
  \ our excitement level reached its peak. The roads throughout this journey were\
  \ loaded potholes and hitches so, we decided rather than getting dizzy, and eventually\
  \ faint off we made ourselves involved in playing dumb charades for those two hours\
  \ of rough commute. Teachers were consistently shouting on us because they couldn't\
  \ even hear the honking of outside vehicles as our hooting had much weight. \n\n\
  When we finally reached Ghatarani, everyone was astounded by the waterfalls, structure\
  \ of temples, and there were so many primitive things to grab our 21st-century brains,\
  \ but the thing I found out most fascinating was a giant spider making its way by\
  \ her own created web to the tip of the central temple from a balcony which was\
  \ literally 1 KM far away, and that zip line kind of web was hanging above a narrow\
  \ stream of water which was falling from the waterfalls surrounding that temple.\n\
  \nAfter having a little brunch break, a tour guide was present there to guide us\
  \ all around the temple, waterfalls, and those mysterious caves where no one dared\
  \ to go. As we explore that place, we got a purest vibe of peacefulness, every now\
  \ and then you can hear that echoing bell ring, water flowing from waterfalls goes\
  \ by touching your foot as you make each step inside the temple, people were offering\
  \ dainties to the monkeys, crabs and other animals rather than indulging it the\
  \ statues, it was totally a surreal experience. \n\nWhen everyone was busy taking\
  \ those selfies me and one of my friends found staircase carved from the mountain\
  \ with a very narrow-steep path, our curiosity triggered and both of us couldn't\
  \ stop ourselves from exploring this mysterious region, as we were making each step\
  \ our vision of the city was expanding; we felt like mountain is surmounting us,\
  \ and that feeling of looking very far is just can't be expressed in words. And\
  \ going further deep into that mountain you can actually find where the water of\
  \ fall is coming in. \n\nT"
