Text: "I\u2019ve never been a hiker yet here I am; me, my failing hopes, and my inconvenient\
  \ forty-pound backpack. We are all working in tandem, each one of us equally fueling\
  \ my defeat. I\u2019m in Gangotri, India with my study abroad group traveling to\
  \ one of the holiest site to Hindus, Gaumukh, the origin of the river Ganges and\
  \ the seat of the goddess Ganga. \n\nMy group is several kilometers ahead of me\
  \ so alone I wander. To my left is a sharp hill with several mountain goats who\
  \ occasionally disturb the earth and send human-sized boulders down the mountain.\
  \ To my right lies a sharp cliff that, if fallen off of, would send me plunging\
  \ into a rushing river. I was alone in a foreign land doing what I thought was the\
  \ impossible - I was hiking.\n\nI begin to take in my surroundings. First, the rare\
  \ sighting of a Himalayan black bear and her cubs. Pilgrims trekking the path barefoot,\
  \ their devotion to their god worn on their sleeves. A husband and wife who 60-\
  \ sympathetically stated that my friends were far ahead of me and I needed to catch\
  \ up. A handful of visitors who see my black skin and begin to laugh. A family sees\
  \ me struggling up the path and what logically follows is the decision to ask me\
  \ for a photo.\n\nI continue to walk.\n\nThen, came the straw that broke the camel\u2019\
  s back. I tripped over a rock. I fell on my back and stared into the heavens. I\
  \ think to myself, I can\u2019t do it. It felt like every fear, every piece of anxiety\
  \ I\u2019ve ever encountered sprouted and grew, wrapping my body in vines of paralysis.\
  \ I began to calculate the what ifs. I was never good at math, but I was always\
  \ estimating the chances of me surviving moments.\n\nI rest my body against the\
  \ rugged boulders that outlined the trail. As I sat slumped over, a wandering holy\
  \ man\u2019s gaze meets my eyes. We stare at each other. Both tanned skinned and\
  \ deep brown eyes. He\u2019s ordinately dressed- white cloths and bare feet. He\
  \ reaches his hand towards me and breathes. In that moment- the fear that once paralyzed\
  \ me seamlessly melted. Because- despite not knowing each other\u2019s language\
  \ we exchanged a moment that transcends verbal communication. We exchanged hope.\
  \  \n\nHis hope ran through my body like adrenaline. I believe he wanted me to experience\
  \ the awe of the glacier Gaumukh; the power the goddess Ganga could grant those\
  \ who come to her. There is a reason why so many hindus walk this dangerous path-\
  \ her beauty is undeniable. \n\nOn the path to Gaumukh, I was blessed by a stranger.\
  \ \n\nI have never walked the same again."
