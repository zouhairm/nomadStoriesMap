Text: "My first time traveling, I wound up in San Francisco, drawn to the Golden State\
  \ by a youthful preoccupation with the California myth -  sand. surf and temperate\
  \ weather.  It was an uncertain step given my lack of experience, my homebody nature,\
  \ financial instability, and general anxiousness.  I had never even flown before.\n\
  \nAt best, I thought I was embarking on what would likely be an unremarkable experience.\
  \  Wherever you go, there you are, some pseudo guru once said.  In other words,\
  \ you can travel all the way across the world but when you get there you\u2019ll\
  \ still be you, with the same heavy psyche and lingering baggage.  It\u2019s all\
  \ the more cathartic when, despite your cynical expectations, you do have that eye-opening,\
  \ mind-altering moment of elation.  The surprising thing about traveling is how\
  \ succinctly it can crack you open and how certain summits and distant realms can\
  \ tug at something buried so deep - a nomadic urge, the desire to escape, to drift\
  \ freely - and how quickly our layers of discomfort are shed when exposed to new\
  \ places.\n\nMy moment of unexpected exhilaration happened on New Year\u2019s Day.\
  \  I had a plan for the day.  I was going to hike from Land\u2019s End to Golden\
  \ Gate Bridge, an approximately three and a half mile journey along the coastal\
  \ trail, as a symbolic shedding of the previous year and commemoration of a new\
  \ one. But even after a few days in San Francisco, I was still skeptical and tense,\
  \ entirely unsure of the value of this experience.  \n  \nAbout halfway along the\
  \ hike, there was a series of intertwining paths stretching up and down the dunes\
  \ of Baker Beach with spectacular views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the rocky\
  \ Northern California coast.  I paused to rest somewhere along one of the plateaus.\
  \  Maybe it was from three hours of intense sun exposure and slight dehydration,\
  \ but as I looked back at the path I had traveled, I was hit by a wave of euphoria.\
  \  As a kid, I had always pretended that the pimply green hills and insignificant\
  \ protrusion of Southern Ontario were mountain ranges and that it\u2019s copper\
  \ colored rivers and lakes fed into something bigger, but I\u2019d underestimated\
  \ the impact of seeing, for the first time, a real lush, raw wilderness, and an\
  \ expansive, sun-kissed ocean.  And I underestimated the clarity and happiness achieved\
  \ by reaching a particular destination.\n\nAs you surrender to the peculiar magic\
  \ of traveling everything becomes more potent and sweeter.  My senses seemed to\
  \ grow stronger, as though they been prodded and nourished by the coast.  I could\
  \ taste my morning dark roast from Java Beach again, its aromatic acidity and therapeutic\
  \ heat. The sights and sounds of the city - meals I\u2019d meant to savor, the local\
  \ color of Haight Street and the Castro, streetcars chiming their way along The\
  \ Embarcadero, the carousels at the pier and the bustling Ferry Building Market\
  \ - came back to me with new richness and texture.   \n\nI think I emerged from\
  \ this hike, however brief, in someway reformed with my senses sharpened and my\
  \ imagination prodded.  That chunk of terrain that marked the end of California\
  \ had, for me, signified the beginning of something new - a thirst to explore, to\
  \ pursue different and provocative places, people and flavors without fear or hesitation."
