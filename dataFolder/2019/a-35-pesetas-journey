Text: "It was Sunday and Chaguito\u2019s mum gave to him 35 pesetas to buy some bread.\
  \ He hadn\u2019t left his house for a week. He was only twelve, but he was always\
  \ involved in any kind of problems. Because of that, his father beat him to resolve\
  \ those troubles. Chaguito went stumbling along the street while he was thinking\
  \ how he could run away from that neighborhood, made up of houses which spread disorderly\
  \ down the hill to the beach. He didn\u2019t know very well where to go. But he\
  \ knew for sure that he was not taking bread home. He wandered around the city.\
  \ At dark, he walked into the port of Santa Cruz. \n\nBefore his eyes, a Pinillos\
  \ cargo ship was docked, connected to the dock by a boarding ladder and, there was\
  \ a sailor on guard. He decided that would be the boat which would take him to the\
  \ nearby island, Gran Canaria. He thought of himself sailing into Puerto de la Luz\
  \ harbour and looking for any kind of job in that city. The only thing was how getting\
  \ on board. As it was Sunday, there was nobody in the surroundings. So, he waited\
  \ for the shift change and got into the boat, then, quickly, he hid into one of\
  \ the big lifeboats.\nNext morning the heat coming from the plastic cover awakened\
  \ him. He had stayed long time in there and his back ached. He could feel the rocking\
  \ of the ship. He kicked a paint pot when stretching. That was a loud noise. Suddenly,\
  \ the tarp that covered the lifeboat got fully opened.\n\n\u2013\tWhat the heck\
  \ are you doing here? \u2013The sailor was atonished.\n\u2013\tI wanted to go to\
  \ Las Palmas \u2013 said Chaguito.\n\u2013\t\xACBloody hell!\n\nThe sailor dragged\
  \ him by his arm strongly, pushed him on his tiptoes along the deck and took Chaguito\
  \ to the Captain. \n\n\u2013\tThis guy wants to go to Las Palmas. Maybe swimming!\
  \ What can we do with him? \n\nThe Captain looked at him up and down. Chaguito thought\
  \ he had better change his attitude. The Captain had a nicer look than the sailor,\
  \ but he made Chaguito feel more frightened.\n\n\u2013\tFelix \u2013 he spoke to\
  \ the sailor \u2013 lock him in some cabin. He mustn\u2019t walk around the boat\
  \ as if at home.\nThe sailor grabbed his neck, as if he had horseshoes instead of\
  \ hands. \n\u2013\tBy the way, Felix. Tell him this ship is not going to Las Palmas.\
  \ His journey will be a little longer.\nFelix started laughing again.\n\u2013\t\
  Boy, have you ever been in England? \u2018Cos there we go!\n\nThe journey lasted\
  \ four days. The rest of the crew took him some food and cigarettes, too. In the\
  \ end, he was allowed to leave the cabin. He used to walk around the decks, talking\
  \ to the sailors about life at sea, he even was taught to tie knots. Felix did it.\
  \ \nWhen the boat arrived in England there was a big fuss with customs authorities.\
  \ You don\u2019t carry your passport when you go to buy some bread. Fortunatly,\
  \ Father Angel, an Anglican priest, who had been gifted with the power of persuasion\
  \ and who could speak a good Spanish, helped him.  Chaguito told him everything.\
  \ It was useless because the priest made up another completly different story and,\
  \ according to the results, it worked perfectly.\n\nWhen every was cleared up, the\
  \ priest proposed Chaguito to join the Anglican Church. Obviously he considered\
  \ Chaguito a poor lost soul. Chaguito refused, he wanted to go back home. The priest\
  \ helped the boy to get in contact with his family and they gathered in Bilbao.\
  \ \nThe boy ran up the street shouting \u201CI got to England with 35 pesetas, I\
  \ got to England with 35 pesetas\u201D; he went on running and shouting, he crossed\
  \ the fields near the school. His friends heard him from the fence which enclosed\
  \ the school yard, they looked confused through the bars. \u201CIs that Chaguito?\u201D\
  \ some of them asked. The boy, still shouting, came nearer and nearer. \u201CThat\u2019\
  s Chaguito!\u201Dthey cried with the exitement of having come across by chance.\
  \ Finally, the boy reached the fence and gasp a last \u201CI got to England with\
  \ 35 pesetas!\u201D"
