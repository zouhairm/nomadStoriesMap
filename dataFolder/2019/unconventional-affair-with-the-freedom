Text: "Peeking from her comfortable life She was looking for something that excites\
  \ her, soothing that makes her jump from her bed and be a little uncomfortable chasing\
  \ something which was prohibited for her.\n\nFreedom, yes she was craving for it\
  \ since she last tasted it when she was out on a field trip sneaking out alone in\
  \ the woods. She was bamboozled by the things she could do when she was free. \n\
  \nNow when she is wiser, she knows exactly she wants and this started her forbidden\
  \ affair with the freedom and the crazy winds. \n\n An unconventional bag on her\
  \ shoulders and lots of dreams in her eyes she started. \n\nMeeting people and seeing\
  \ unrealistic parts of her country, she was happily confused why she never looked\
  \ at the world this way before. World is so beautiful and full amusement that it\
  \ scares her how much time she has wasted chasing stupid things. \n\nAnyways she\
  \ was enlightened by all this beauty and the kindness she was receiving.\n\nThis\
  \ affair was not one sided but the consequences were one sided. The Societies of\
  \ the world stand in front of her to stop but she didn't listen, she was too much\
  \ in love with her freedom and the view."
