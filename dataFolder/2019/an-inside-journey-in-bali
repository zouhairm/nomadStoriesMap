Text: "Some trips just blow your mind while you're living them, some others \u2013\
  \ for whatever reason \u2013 need more time to get under your skin.\nIt happens\
  \ one day, while I'm at home, lazily watching Netflix \u201CChef's Table\u201D,\
  \ an eye-catching series of documentaries on celebrity chefs. This one's about Will\
  \ Goldfarb, a New York pastry chef running away from his stressful big-city life,\
  \ who apparently disappeared to reappear in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nBali.\n\nJust three\
  \ years ago, on my thirty-first birthday, I'm flying from Melbourne towards this\
  \ tiny island, a weirdly-shaped spot in the Pacific Ocean. \nGizelle, a Canadian\
  \ pastry chef (temporarily lent to Australia), is dragging me there, and I just\
  \ let her take the lead: my life is on a pause, I feel broken, interrupted.\n\n\
  There's no trace of my travel expertise at this time, just a couple of online reservations\
  \ I've made without putting much effort into it.\nAt a first glance, I would say\
  \ I'm feeling rather annoyed by Bali: all that light, those colors, those harmonious\
  \ shapes... they seem to crash againts my inside ruins.\n\nIt's been three years,\
  \ or maybe a hundred, and it just takes one episode of a random TV show to raise\
  \ with surprising clarity what I had previously experienced in a state of semi-conscience.\
  \ My mind glides rapidly over the lush green rice terraces with their sinuous curves,\
  \ above the bright colored flowers, the lively silence of intricate gardens, the\
  \ smell of spices and the fleshy taste of fresh coconut.\n\nAll of a sudden, everything\
  \ is incredibly near.\n\nI can feel the wooden floor on which I try to do some yoga,\
  \ plunged in a pacific chaos, I can hear the infinite echo of a gong, a voice telling\
  \ me that I need to feel, live, suffer, face my sorrow. I can taste those salty\
  \ tears on my tongue, while I silently shout among a bunch of strangers.\n\nMy memory\
  \ changes, as my thoughts move to that cooking class with a local lady, who embraces\
  \ us with silky gentleness, while our senses wander among the spices smashed with\
  \ dried fruit on a coarse stone, the grilled meat caramelized by some thick scented\
  \ smoke, the freshness of the fruit penetrated by sharp knives. The spoon carving\
  \ between the hard coconut wood and the smooth whiteness of the pulp. The heat of\
  \ the spicy broth, whose steams wet the surrounding air.\n\nAnd, finally, there\
  \ goes my mind, at the foot of Mount Batur; at two in the morning. It's dark, my\
  \ friend is way faster than me and I lose her after a couple of minutes. It's dark,\
  \ and I'm scared. The sandy ground melts under my feet wrapped in my low-budget\
  \ tennis shoes.\nHumidity makes it harder to breathe, I sweat heavily under my worn-out\
  \ t-shirt, while the grey sand fills my shoes at every exhausted step. We walk in\
  \ line in the darkness, while strangers with torches try to light our way to the\
  \ top.\nI'm breathless, tears start flowing down my cheeks as I stop beside the\
  \ path to let other people pass.\nIt's still dark. A local man comes towards me,\
  \ asks no questions, offers me a hand. Maybe he's smiling. I don't know. On the\
  \ other hand he's holding a torch, with which he makes the ground around my feet\
  \ brighter. We start walking as he holds my hand up to the top of the volcano. When\
  \ we finally get there, we all sit down, silently, as we wait, staring at the horizon.\n\
  It's already five in the morning, when a red light slides horizontally on the surface\
  \ of the lake at the bottom of the valley. Then another ray of light: golden, this\
  \ time. Silence, again, nobody moves. Among the rocks, some steam of the active\
  \ volcano starts to show.\nThe light inflates on the horizon, the world regains\
  \ its shape, the path looks clear now. A couple of monkeys lazily sit on a corner,\
  \ bored, one leaned against the other. \nI feel weak, but I'm still here. A new\
  \ day has started and I've survived.\nI just don't know it yet."
