Text: "It was an unplanned trip to Kerala as my sister was passing out from her training.\
  \ As we were landing in Kerala, everything around that we could see was greenery.\
  \ We were heading towards our hotel and on the way we could see a lot of trees and\
  \ it was already cloudy and the weather was really pleasant. We crossed a bridge\
  \ which was over the backwaters and could spot 'Chinese Fishing Net', which is still\
  \ used and is a symbol of history in Kerala and an attraction for tourists. \nAlthough\
  \ it was a short trip to Kerala, but the very next day we witnessed the passing\
  \ out of my sister and she had already planned for a trip for us for the next two\
  \ days. \nThe very next day we left for \"Munnar\",  a hill station. On our drive\
  \ to Munnar we got a chance to hop into a boat and have a 45minute long boat ride\
  \ in the backwaters which covered half of the city and while on the boat, we spotted\
  \ a unique bird, an old man collecting shells and mangroves all around but it was\
  \ satisfying and getting to see the Chinese Fishing Net with a group of birds sitting\
  \ on it was another attraction for us. Also, adding on to that was the fresh coconut\
  \ water that we got on our way from a family that that stays along the backwaters\
  \ and it made out day. \nAfter this we headed to Munnar again and it had started\
  \ raining but the smell of rain just made it so fresh all around. Our next stop\
  \ was at a Traditional Kerala restaurant where we had Special Kerala food which\
  \ was a delight. The next we stopped was at the Elephant Safari which took us into\
  \ the forests and we could see the farming of spices and could get the aroma of\
  \ that in the environment (a must). We also had a chance to visit the Chocolate\
  \ Factory, where we bought some homemade chocolates and after this long tiring journey\
  \ we went for the Ayurvedic Massage which indeed was very relaxing and then we headed\
  \ to the hilltop where we had our hotel booked and it was an adventurous drive to\
  \ that hotel as it was all dark and raining with fog. \nThe next day we had a sumptuous\
  \ breakfast and left for Kerala(Ernakulam) again and on our way back we went for\
  \ a Jeep safari which took us through the villages and we got to see the Ripple\
  \ Waterfall, the Suspended bridge, a very famous Dam, the plantation and a spot\
  \ from where we could see the whole of Kerala. It felt heavenly, all we could see\
  \ was greenery all around. Then while returning, we were all tired as the Jeep safari\
  \ took around 4-5hours and we got the Ayurvedic massage done again and left for\
  \ Kerala from there. \nAfter a long drive through the hills, once we reached Kerala\
  \ we got to know that there was a surprise party planned for us, that just added\
  \ on to the short trip and just made the day very happening. Also, how can I miss\
  \ visiting the Fort Kochi that took us to a different era and we could see some\
  \ historical elements too which was artistic as well. \nIf you are someone who loves\
  \ nature, peace, love to understand and see how spices are planted and witness a\
  \ rich cultural heritage, you must plan a visit to KERALA and indulge into the greenery."
