Text: "Travel lover. Had immense experience. Each moment is worth sharing. but i would\
  \ like to highlight my trip of Iran. It was not less than a leap into the unknown.\
  \ A complete new idea and adventure. Back in October 2016 i went to Iran's famous\
  \ city Esfahan. Once a historic and largest city of the world. It's landmark includes\
  \ one of the world largest square (Naqsh E Jahan). A UNESCO world heritage site.\
  \ The square is surrounded by buildings from the Safavid era. The Shah Mosque, Ali\
  \ Qapu palace and the Grand Bazar.\n\nThe chili weather still reminds me of the\
  \ fountain spray that used to sprinkle the water in each direction. Setting for\
  \ longer until the crowd diminish and everything get calm and silent, when people\
  \ left for their hotels and rooms, around the square. Then i would look around and\
  \ think of the great architecture and their works. Ali Qapu build in almost 1500\
  \ is still unique in it's design and shape. Made of woods and multiple stories.\
  \ From the top of the palace, i used to have a view of the whole square for hours.\
  \ There i would meet with tourists from around the world. It was great to listen\
  \ to their stories and experience. \n\nThen the historical Chehel Sotoun (forty\
  \ columns). It was mesmerizing for me. It colored my whole trip. After enjoying\
  \ each part of the Chehel sotoun, i decided to have some rest. Thus i went to a\
  \ coffee shop. It was a traditional shop. The traditional decoration. The teapot,\
  \ sweets, tea cups and sofas were so awesome. It was completely new for me. I was\
  \ setting there for almost an hour. Talking with the tea maker. Took pictures of\
  \ his unique shop. I enjoyed listening to him. He told about the big kettle and\
  \ about traditional cultural items, unique cloth design on the shop walls. \n\n\
  The cold nights were more enjoyable than i thought off. The Si O Se pul and Khaju\
  \ Bridge are of immense value in Esfahan. When the waters flows under the bridge,\
  \ the city is more excited and people will come in crowds to sing and enjoy in groups.\
  \ Although at that time there were no water in the river but still huge crowds were\
  \ there setting in the unique rooms of the bridge. They were singing, eating and\
  \ smoking shesha. \n\nThe most wonderful place was the Vank Cathedral or the Church\
  \ of the Saintly Sisters. Located in the Jolfa District of Esfahan. A landmark of\
  \ the 1600 era. The Cathedral has a museum  and library inside it. It hosts almost\
  \ hundreds of valuable Armenian and medieval European language scripts and arts.\
  \  It has one of the world oldest printing press machine. It gave me a pleasurable\
  \ time. I met with elderly Christians. The old man was too friendly but unfortunately\
  \ we couldn't talk with ease due to language bearers. Still he told me much about\
  \ each historical thing inside the museum. He also told me about the hanging place\
  \ where hundreds of innocent people were once hanged for their beliefs and religious\
  \ views.  \n\nTo conclude i can say that it was a new and excited experience of\
  \ my life. I met with new people and saw their culture. It was unique, friendly\
  \ and loving. Although this experience is two years older but still it's alive in\
  \ mind like yesterday event. It was a leap into the unknown but that proved to be\
  \ the most joyous moment of my life. I wish to have such experience each year. To\
  \ visit new places and have a story of it."
