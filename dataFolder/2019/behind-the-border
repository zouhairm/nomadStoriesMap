Text: "After an 8-hour bus ride crossing into the Sinai Peninsula through the night,\
  \ followed by another 6-hour bus ride and a hike across the desert with my over-packed\
  \ luggage, I finally made it to the Egypt-Israel border crossing around 11:30AM\
  \ on Friday. \n\nI had read stories about how you should prepare to spend some time\
  \ there because of heightened security, but I didn\u2019t expect it would be too\
  \ much of a problem. Just in case, I booked my bus from Eilat to Jerusalem for 3:30\
  \ to give myself plenty of time to cross, grab some food, and get comfy before the\
  \ journey. \n\nIt was my turn to talk to the immigration official. She began to\
  \ ask how I, as a solo female, found the money to go to the places I had been. With\
  \ eyes full of skepticism and judgment, she asked how much I had in my bank account\
  \ and if I was meeting a man on the other side. As I explained that I just enjoyed\
  \ solo-travel, I wasn\u2019t meeting any men and didn\u2019t plan to, she called\
  \ her manager over who showed me to a tiny, private investigation room with yellow-painted\
  \ walls that reminded me of a school infirmary. \n\nI explained my bus and hostel\
  \ reservation for Jerusalem, and showed proof of the itineraries, along with my\
  \ flight to leave the country in 10 days. Hours passed by as the manager put me\
  \ through one investigation process after another; requesting me to take my clothes\
  \ off to be searched, asking for the passwords for my phone, reading my emails and\
  \ texts, looking through my photos, and dumping out all of my belongings onto the\
  \ floor. With tears welling up in my eyes as I struggled to put my clothes back\
  \ on, it was the first time I had wondered if this trip was worth it. \n\nThe manager\
  \ then looked at her watch, looked at all of my belongings scattered across the\
  \ floor, and looked up at me before muttering a barely audible, \u201Cyou can go\
  \ now.\u201D She stamped my passport and left me there to clean up the mess that\
  \ she left of all of my personal belongings that I had been traveling with over\
  \ the last 7 months. It was 4:00PM on the dot and Shabbat had begun, meaning I not\
  \ only missed my bus, but everything was shut down for their weekly 25-hour observance\
  \ of rest and prayer. I wanted to go home. \n\nAfter spending hours wandering the\
  \ streets of Eilat in the suffocating August heat and collapsing on a curb with\
  \ a salty mixture of sweat and tears running down my face, I finally found a place\
  \ to stay for the night so I could catch the next bus to Jerusalem first thing in\
  \ the morning. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before I boarded a bus that would take me\
  \ across the border into Palestine where I had arranged to Couch Surf with a family\
  \ in Nablus. When I got off the bus, it was as if I had woken up from a bad dream.\
  \ I was met with huge, warm smiles and hugs from people I had never met before,\
  \ excited to show me their home and their little piece of paradise. I was taken\
  \ to the market, where everyone offered me traditional sweets and friendly conversations,\
  \ sat and drank tea in a place where the tables and chairs were actually inside\
  \ the river, and went back to the house where the mother had prepared an entire\
  \ family feast to welcome me as a guest. \n\nThe warmth and love that was shared\
  \ with me within those walls that surrounded the West Bank was unparalleled to any\
  \ other experience. My new friends dropped me off at the bus station to head to\
  \ Tel Aviv and the father took me to the side, almost ashamed by what he was going\
  \ to ask. He placed his hand on my arm, looked me in the eyes and asked me if I\
  \ could write his family a letter that said I was their friend in hopes they could\
  \ apply for permission to step outside of the walls someday. They had never seen\
  \ the other side."
