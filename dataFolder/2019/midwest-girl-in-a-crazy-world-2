Text: "When I was given the opportunity to step outside of myself and the country\
  \ alone I experienced a fleeting anxiety. I decided to put my big girl panties on\
  \ and do my research. Culturally where I am from in the Midwest folks are scared\
  \ of anything out of the ordinary. I had found myself newly back home and in dire\
  \ need of a change of scenery.\n\nHe was a lover that I had met previously on a\
  \ girls trip. He begged me for 2 long years to come back to him, so I did. I had\
  \ 10 days off for spring break as a teacher. The plan was to stay with him in his\
  \ swanky digs in St. Anne's outside of Ochos Rios. \n\nThe first few days were great.\
  \ I went swimming with the locals, hung out at the shanty bars that lined the streets\
  \ of Priory; went to a strip club that would put an Atlanta club to shame; hung\
  \ out at impromptu dancehall parties in the street; visited Margaritaville Ochos\
  \ Rios; ate fresh curry everything and had mind blowing sex. \n\nHowever, on the\
  \ 5th day my lover began to scramble and scurry around the house throwing \"his\
  \ sister's\" clothes in a bag and running off and telling me to pack in haste. I\
  \ was so perplexed, scared, and upset with myself. I had yo keep a firm grip on\
  \ my emotions so that I could go into my Plan B mode. He returned 20 mins later\
  \ to vaguely explain that some serious stuff was going down and that he had to take\
  \ me to another house. I was not down with his plan. I had booked a room in a hostel\
  \ in Montego Bay just in case some s!%# hit the fan. I insisted he take me to the\
  \ city.\n\nThe ride to Montego was full of me crying and snotting. I was calling\
  \ my friends talking crap about him in his face. 45 minutes later we ended up in\
  \ Montego Bay. As the car climbed its way into the city my heart started to sink.\
  \ I don't know anyone and the neighborhood looked a little sketchy. \n\nFinally,\
  \ we make it to Mobay Kotch, wich is this quaint historic building with winding\
  \ stairs and hardwood floors as far as the eye can see. As I check in and he lugs\
  \ my things behind him I see a patio to my left and hear the familiar chattering\
  \ and clanging of distant strangers in a hostel becoming friends. My heart sighed\
  \ and I was instantly ready for him to leave so that I could be the social butterfly\
  \ that I am and salvage my trip.\n\nOnce settled I sat on the patio and listened\
  \ to everyone introduce themselves. I joined in and told everyone a watered down\
  \ version of my stay. Niles from Austria offered me a Red Stripe and the hostel\
  \ keeper offered me a spliff and it was in that moment that I knew I had made a\
  \ great decision. \n\nStaying in REAL Montego Bay was everything. We had assembled\
  \ a United Nations crew for saftey. I hung out with Europeans, Asians, Africans\
  \ and Canadians (of course everyone wanted to talk about 45 lol). We roamed the\
  \ beaches, clubs, bars, malls, markets and late night food vendors during a time\
  \ when the town was on watch. I never felt scared or in danger. I even went to the\
  \ beauty shop and got my dreadlocks done -you know black women don't play about\
  \ their hair- that was the best wash and twist I ever had.\n\nLong story short,\
  \ had I not took a leap of faith I wouldn't be the honorary Montego Bay resident\
  \ that I am now. I also would have never acquired some of the great friends that\
  \ I did from this trip. Montego Bay, Jamaica doesn't owe me a thing!\n\nP.S. I only\
  \ paid $100 USD to stay at Mobay Kotch Hostel for a week!! #budgetnista"
