Text: "My day started with me wondering a parking lot looking to buy a ticket to the\
  \ Tierra del Fuego National Park in Ushuaia, Argentina. I was hiking to the end\
  \ of the road, to the end of the world, to the end of Ruta Nacional 3. A famous\
  \ Argentine highway stretching from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia - the southernmost city\
  \ in the world. \n\nI quickly found a lady selling tickets to the park, so I purchased\
  \ one and she told me to wait for my driver. I immediately noticed that the lady\
  \ that I just bought my ticket from was gone, she disappeared. I didn\u2019t see\
  \ the driver anywhere.  For a moment I thought I had been scammed but after asking\
  \ for help I found my driver. \L\n\nMy driver didn\u2019t speak English and I was\
  \ the only one in the van so we talked. My broken Italian allowed me to make basic\
  \ conversation. The driver was an older man who was kind and sweet.  He couldn\u2019\
  t say my first name so I gave him my middle Italian name, Lucia. He instantly shortened\
  \ it to Luci. I smiled, I made my first friend and picked up a nickname.\_\n\nAs\
  \ we drove, I decided to map out my hiking route. I had about six hours before the\
  \ last bus.  I noticed on the information pamphlet that the first trail, which ended\
  \ at the visitors\u2019 center, was 3/4 hours. I read this as 45 minutes, 3/4th\
  \ of an hour. I wanted to see as much as possible, so I got off at the first stop.\
  \  \n\nAs I started down the trail along the rocky shoreline, I admired the sun\
  \ shining off the blue water.  Eventually the trail curved into the forest.  I noticed\
  \ that the trail was losing its path-like quality as I went deeper into the forest.\
  \  Then I stumbled upon a Frenchman counting his pesos. It was a strange sight.\
  \  We were both lost as the trail just stopped so we decided to head back together.\
  \  I learned that 3/4 hours is actually three to four hours. I had read the map\
  \ wrong.  \n\nI tried to get a ride at the first stop but was denied.  So off I\
  \ went down the dusty road by foot.  After an hour of walking down a long dirt road\
  \ with absolutely no scenic views I decided I needed a new plan.  I flagged down\
  \ a bus going in the wrong direction but got on it anyways. Thankfully the driver\
  \ understood me and helped me get on a new bus in the right direction. \n\nI finally\
  \ arrived to the visitors\u2019 center.  Surprisingly, I had enough time to walk\
  \ along the shore of Lago Roca if I skipped lunch.  I pulled out a small treat in\
  \ my bag to munch on as I walked down to the lakeshore.  The black-necked swans\
  \ were swimming in the cold but inviting lake and the dense-forested mountains stretched\
  \ as far as my eyes could see. \n\nAfter my stroll, I started my trek to the end\
  \ of Ruta Nacional 3. This is where I got lost again. I took a detour when I should\
  \ have stayed on the main path. I had to backtrack yet again. Finally, after an\
  \ hour of hiking, I saw people standing around a large sign taking pictures.  I\
  \ had made it - to the end of the world.  \n\nI took my photo, walked around and\
  \ waited for the bus.  \n\nOn the way back into town, I saw a hotel with the name\
  \ Olga, my nonna\u2019s name. I was worn out from the long day but seeing her name\
  \ gave me comfort.  I was proud of myself for being here and my journey through\
  \ South America was beginning.\n\nI would go on to see my nonna\u2019s name spray-painted\
  \ along the shores of Montevideo, Uruguay - she made other appearances too.  My\
  \ trip took me to nine countries in nine months.  When I look back, I am thankful\
  \ for misreading the map and getting lost.  Without this mistake I would only have\
  \ a photo of me standing by a famous sign. My journey to reach the end of road was\
  \ the memory, the adventure."
