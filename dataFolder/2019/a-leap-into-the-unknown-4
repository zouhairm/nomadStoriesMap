Text: "Trips that you take on your own are places that leave you breathless, people\
  \ who don\u2019t understand you on your dilettantish Spanish, narrow steep streets,\
  \ short but inspiring days, seeking inspiration while navigating your place in the\
  \ universe.\n\t\nI had to go. I do not know exactly from what or whom, I would rather\
  \ say I went after something. It has been calling me for years, alluring me from\
  \ the corner of subconscious, and sending small signals and motivational messages.\
  \ I had to go to find myself again. Time passes quickly when you turn a blind eye\
  \ and sink into your duties and daily routine, but you can\u2019t ignore your soul\
  \ forever.\n\t\nThe day comes, seemingly quite ordinary, and you know it's time.\
  \ At first, I was overwhelmed with euphoria and various scenarios I packed in my\
  \ head. Later, I was scared and worried\u2026 and again euphoric. This is the way\
  \ of experiencing the world with my senses. \n\t\nAt the airport alone, with two\
  \ large suitcases filled to the top with essentially unnecessary things and just\
  \ a couple of memories. As the plane takes off, I am broadening my mind. I'll learn\
  \ the art of living. I will meet incredible people, new languages and different\
  \ cultures. Strange habits and another picture of the world. Different customs and\
  \ unknown roads. New words and expressions, prices and brands. Specific Mexican\
  \ cuisine, Italian pizza and pasta, stories about Escobar directly from Colombia,\
  \ the fact that in Korea on the day of your birth, you are considered to be one-year\
  \ old, Spanish songs and beer from Barcelona. \n\nInternational student parties\
  \ and long days at the university trying to understand business idioms and expressions\
  \ in Spanish. Instagram profiles of people around the world. Facebook group full\
  \ of student exchange experiences. Google maps as my best friend. And weird Spanish\
  \ pillows ...\n\nEnglish-Spanish negotiations about renting an apartment, at the\
  \ bus station - buying a ticket in two directions, in the store - while I'm looking\
  \ for a culinary cream, in a blind street - when I got lost, at the university -\
  \ as I orient in A, B, C, D buildings, and finally, that night in the disco - when\
  \ I met him.\n \nA man has to spend eternity on things that are nothing, to understand\
  \ the value of the moment that is everything. In that exact moment I threw away\
  \ my compass and maps, and even though I was lost somewhere in the world, I\u2019\
  ve never felt closer to home.\n\nI had to go. I do not know exactly from what or\
  \ whom, I would rather say I went after something. \nYes, I went after me."
