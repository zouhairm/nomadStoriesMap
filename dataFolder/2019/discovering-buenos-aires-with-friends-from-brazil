Text: "It was 2010. I chose remembering this travel  because good memories with lovely\
  \ friends and beautiful places with strong culture never escape of our mind and\
  \ heart. Me and my three bestfriends,  Julio, J\xFAlia and Rafaela, decided to go\
  \ to Argentina by bus from S\xE3o Paulo. We knew the travel could to be long, first\
  \ we live in a wide country as Brasil in the southest region, we have to pass all\
  \ south region to arrive at our destine, Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina.\
  \ It was incredible to see the fields of our south region and the borders of our\
  \ neighbor gran hermano country, Argentina. When we arrived at bus station of Buenos\
  \ Aires we were so tired and with hungry, we took a t\xE1xi to arrive at our rental\
  \ apartment in Belgrano district, there we could enjoy a relax place with a lot\
  \ of things to do. In the corner with Jorge Newberry y Cabildo we saw a little restaurant\
  \ with a green front that sell some tradicional foods and drinks, all them was delicious,\
  \ a lot of kinds empanadas with diverse flavour and chorip\xE1n made in the same\
  \ moment and refreshing drinks with fernet, pisco y cerveza. \nDespite the long\
  \ travel we did in the after day we woke up early, me and J\xFAlio were responsible\
  \ for record all step that we gave with a little c\xE2mera. Step by step we go out\
  \ passes by the historical centers and streets. I didin't expect to find a lot of\
  \ memories of the culture and history of argentines in every street that we passed.\
  \ The people are thankfull and have a good education, political and easygoing talk\
  \ to present for us brazilian foreign their daily lives. We as artists loved the\
  \ expression of the Argentina, they have beautiful theathers and libraries. The\
  \ tango a genre of music and dance was present in the plazas. At caminito we found\
  \ portrait of the greaters writers of there, as J\xFAlio Cortazar, Jorge Lu\xED\
  s Borges and vinyl of the great singer Gina Maria Hidalgo, as well the stories of\
  \ Mafalda.\nWe go out from Argentina after 2 months. Another memories are possible\
  \ to appear, from our shopping at malls and supermarket, until our visit to historical\
  \ point with simbolic feeling for the argentine democracy. Here I try to expose\
  \ in general a little of thoughts that could be developed with passion, affect and\
  \ fun as it was left in my mind. Before comeback to Brazil, we cooked toghather,\
  \ we did share lectures of spanish plays in our apartment, we went to a party at\
  \ UVA, the university of Buenos Aires, and met very glad people as the cinema student\
  \ C\xEDntia. \nAlways our pocket guide helped us to arrive in incredible places.\
  \ Hey I can't forget of the boliches and Te matar\xE9 Ramirez the sensual restaurant\
  \ that is decorated with candles and roseswith tables for two dating person or a\
  \ group of friends. I have to retorn to Discovery the World. Nowadays I am living\
  \ in Salvador da Bahia, learning and sharing my experi\xEAncies with this beautiful\
  \ and hot brazilian people."
