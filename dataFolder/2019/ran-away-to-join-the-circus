Text: "I lived in Canada my whole life. I moved from a farm, to a small town and then\
  \ into (what I thought was) a big city. I did what I was supposed to: I finished\
  \ school, got a job at an engineering company, and spent at least half of my conscious\
  \ hours at work. I ate healthy, I worked out, I spent what little left over energy\
  \ I had with friends and family. After 6 years, I was tired. I was beyond tired.\
  \ I was soul crushingly exhausted and sometimes literally bored to tears. I had\
  \ odd little hobbies on the side that would spark life in my life, like dancing\
  \ and archery, but slowly it all melted back into the monotony soup of life. \n\n\
  I started doing personal development, studying philosophy, and trying to find some\
  \ meaning to what I was going through. During this process I learned something valuable:\
  \ there is no meaning. Existential nihilism is the philosophical perspective that\
  \ life has no intrinsic meaning. Life was full of possibilities, but the only real\
  \ significance anywhere was in our minds. Descartes said \"I think therefore I am\"\
  \ because we can't really know anything is true. If nothing is certainly real and\
  \ has no meaning, then we make up the rules in our lives and we say who we are.\
  \  It was that moment in the matrix where Neo discovers \"there is no spoon.\" I\
  \ began to think \"if I'm making the rules, and my life is what I make it, why am\
  \ I making myself so miserable?\" All I ever wanted to do was learn, and travel.\
  \ \n\nAn opportunity happen to arise in my life at that point. My land lady's sister\
  \ came to visit from Mexico. We got to talking, I took her out dancing and she told\
  \ me about her life. At the age of 21 she fell in love with a Mexico circus clown\
  \ and ran off to the circus. She stayed there for 17 years, had a son, and although\
  \ she eventually had a (more or less) civilized separation from her dear clown,\
  \ she still ran parts of the circus. She invited me to come to Mexico and dance\
  \ in the circus. I had been dancing for a few years, one of the hobbies I still\
  \ hold dearest. In Canada when I wasn't slaving away behind a computer, I was dancing,\
  \ and I had gotten pretty good. Her offer, what had seemed like a ludicrous idea\
  \ at first, solidified into the obvious next path for me. I quit my job, gave my\
  \ land lady notice, and packed my things. \n\nNow I live in Mexico, and my stories\
  \ are endless and as colorful as the people here. I have created a variety of incomes\
  \ that support my frequent travels all around Mexico, and most recently Europe.\
  \ I write more, I read more, I laugh more, I dance more, and I know without a doubt\
  \ that my life, with all of its ups and downs, is mine to shape however I want it.\
  \ I was never a victim of my life, I was the author, and little by little, I'm getting\
  \ a bit better with my words. I work for my dreams now, not someone else's. I am\
  \ not the same person I was before. The people I've met, the things I've seen and\
  \ everything I've learned has changed me. I want to share with everyone that journey,\
  \ so they can find new possibilities for their own."
