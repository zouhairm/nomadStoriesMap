Text: "I don\u2019t think people take leaps into the unknown often enough. Not just\
  \ people, also myself. I think we become too comfortable with the familiar and continue\
  \ down that path until we grow bored. Although I believe this is the case, I also\
  \ believe when we take these leaps they forever change us. I know this is sounding\
  \ philosophical, more than I had intended. If you met me you would realize very\
  \ quickly that I am not a philosophical person. I just think we should refrain from\
  \ becoming too comfortable by taking leaps into the unknown. \n\nTwo years ago,\
  \ I took the biggest leap I ever had in my twenty-one years of life. I decided to\
  \ study abroad in Swansea, Wales. I realize some people may not consider this a\
  \ leap, but it most certainly was for this girl. I was very comfortable at my university\
  \ and with my friends but randomly decided to apply on a whim. After LOTS of humming\
  \ and hawing, I decided to follow through with this decision and leap into the unknown.\
  \ It felt more like a long jump than a leap. I had never travelled to the UK or\
  \ Europe before, don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019ve travelled lots, but I had never\
  \ made it to the continent that intrigued me most. I already adored it and I\u2019\
  d never been. \n\nAs I travelled from London to Wales, it felt like an eternity\
  \ (if you know you know) and my nerves stood more and more on edge. Why did I leave\
  \ my place of comfort? I don\u2019t know these people. I don\u2019t know this place.\
  \ But I got to know the people and I got to know the place and Swansea felt like\
  \ home. \n\nWales is an underrated country. There I said it. Even though that may\
  \ be an unpopular opinion to most, I absolutely loved the crazy nights on Wind Street\
  \ and day trips to the beach. Along with, the convenience of travelling throughout\
  \ the rest of Europe. Best leap I ever took. I think everyone should live abroad\
  \ at least once in their life. Not only do you learn a lot about different cultures\
  \ and ways of life, but also to learn about yourself. If I could live anywhere and\
  \ everywhere, I would. And I will live abroad again, no doubt in my mind. This time\
  \ it will feel like less of a long jump and more like a leap."
