Text: "My helmet fit securely. My helmet lamp was working. My wetsuit finally fit\
  \ with a balance of snugness yet mobility of movement that satisfied my guide.\n\
  \nT Ve, who had been guiding these trips for years, gave us some instruction out\
  \ here in the warm sunlight. \"At one point just after we jump off a waterfall I\
  \ will have you join up, with each of you grabbing the feet of the person behind\
  \ you to form a chain. Hold on tight so that we don't lose anyone in the dark\"\
  .\n\nWaterfall? I found myself somewhat distracted\_at that part of the sentence.\
  \ \"When you jump off the waterfall I need you to face backwards but don't just\
  \ fall off, really push yourself off to get over the rocks\". It occurred to me\
  \ that I did not recall seeing jumping off waterfalls in the brochure.\n\nBlack\
  \ water rafting  is a cross between spelunking and tubing. With a wetsuit, helmet,\
  \ helmet lamp, and inner tube I would float down an underground river in one of\
  \ the many caves in the Waitomo Caves area of New Zealand.\n\nJust after entering\
  \ the cave T Ve said, \"I have to go back and get my tube. You need to figure out\
  \ which of these two passages we should take next. The one on the left has an eel\"\
  . With that he left us in the dark.\n\nAs the only man in the group it seemed to\
  \ be my responsibility to explore the path. I chose, for reasons that should be\
  \ readily apparent, the right fork. Fortunately the eel-less route proved to be\
  \ the correct answer. It was not until later as we were warming up with hot soup\
  \ and bagels that T Ve started telling stories about 6 foot long eels trying to\
  \ bite him while he was pulling a chain of tourists through the cave.\n\nThe cave\
  \ is filled with the sound of water. At times it is the gentle drip, drip, drip\
  \ that will eventually add to the stalactite formations. At times it is the rush\
  \ of an underground cataract. The air of the cave is filled with mist which frustrates\
  \ T Ve as he tries to take pictures of the group. A camera flash just lights up\
  \ the air.\n\nThe wet suits insulated us from water that was around 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\
  \ The first time we had to jump into a pool of water, the cold water poured down\
  \ the inside of my wetsuit in a way that recalled to mind several Anglo Saxon words\
  \ that I don't normally use but then caught them in my throat with the sudden intake\
  \ of breath. Two of my companions were quite thin in a manner that suggested they\
  \ had never worked at a company that offered free doughnuts. My years of preparing\
  \ additional insulation kept me from shivering, like they were, after nearly an\
  \ hour in the water.\n\nMy hands were exposed and quickly lost feeling from the\
  \ cold. Losing feeling might be helpful as they got scuffed and scratched as I clambered\
  \ over rocks carrying my tube one minute and then the next minute pushed off against\
  \ the sides and roof of the cave to propel my inner tube. At times that roof was\
  \ close enough to the top of the river that you had to put your head back or sideways\
  \ to breathe in the small space, but at other times the roof would rise up and off\
  \ into the distance where your head lamp would not illuminate it. We would turn\
  \ off our lamps and float lazily in a dark chamber lit only by glow worms.\n\n\"\
  OK, this is the waterfall I told you about\", T Ve shouted above the roar. It was\
  \ not tall for a waterfall but in the dark whatever rocks were at the bottom were\
  \ hidden from sight but were looming large in my imagination. I chose to face forward\
  \ and lept out into the dark of the cave and into the deep (enough) inky waters.\
  \ My head broke the surface of the water as I bobbed back up. Frigid water ran down\
  \ my back that made me truly awake if not truly alive."
