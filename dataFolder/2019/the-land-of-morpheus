Text: "I thrived on her passion and excitement about every single detail. She had\
  \ no interest in seeing the world as a mere spectator, but rather in sensing it.\
  \ A sip of coffee in a remote tavern could bring a shiny blush all over her cheeks.\
  \ A violin solo in a forgotten narrow street would trigger a tear in her greyish\
  \ almond-shaped eyes. And I travelled with her and through her. Her never-ending\
  \ hunger to sense the world in her particular way would send me to another realm.\
  \ A peaceful state of mind in which everything was possible. \n\nWe would sit by\
  \ the window at night to daydream about our future and create our own stories. We\
  \ would go to the nearby park and we would have a picnic, sunbathing under every\
  \ single silver lining of the clouds. We would run and run through the streets with\
  \ the song of our bumping hearts and our wild lungs fighting for air. We would sit\
  \ by the window before travelling to the land of Morpheus, hoping for another day\
  \ to come. \n\nI travelled through her during two years of hope, seven hundred and\
  \ thirty trips to the most beautiful places I could have ever imagined. Sitting\
  \ by the window of the hospital, I could sense the beauty of the world thanks to\
  \ her passionate stories. We tried to take the train to the land of my cure many\
  \ nights but we never found it and I had to travel to Morpheus\u2019 land to remain\
  \ there."
