Text: "Abuelita brushes a deviant curl away from my cheek and holds my face with her\
  \ gaze. It\u2019s been a year and 4 months since we saw each other last and though\
  \ we only have a short time together, she leisurely studies me. With a dirty laugh\
  \ she discloses her findings: \n\u201CYou know, your Spanish and your spirit is\
  \ stronger, your sense of humour\u2026 meh... it is still wicked! But you have a\
  \ song, yes... a song in your body\u2026 it is love! Tell me, where your beloved\
  \ lives? \n\nActual geography or jest? I toy with what will taunt her all-knowing\
  \ feathers the most. In her 68 years, she reminds us frequently, she has seen everything\
  \ at least a couple of times over. Little shocks or even amuses her. She nods her\
  \ head at me, less \u201CGo on\u201D more \u201CI dare you\u201D. \n\n\u201CMy beloved\
  \ lives in my elbow, everything I create, he extends,\u201D I play. \n\u201CBut,\
  \ where does he live?\u201D \n\u201CHe lives in the curve behind my knees, as I\
  \ move through the world he supports my movements.\u201D\n \u201CD\xF3nde vive el?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CIn the folds of my eyelashes, there is only sweeping clarity.\u201D\n\
  \ \u201CHmm,\u201D she pauses, smirking. \n\nWe are studying each other now. \n\n\
  \u201CAh! It means first, you fell in love with yourself and... with this travelling\
  \ you become a mystic,  poet-sage. Ha! Like Rumi, Ibn Battuta, you think?\u201D\
  \ She cackles, pouring us both hibiscus tea. \n\nYes, Battuta, years prior was scribbled\
  \ in notebooks: \u201CTraveling\u2014it leaves you speechless, then turns you into\
  \ a storyteller.\u201D Since, I\u2019ve learnt that the stories worth sharing, must\
  \ match our journeys inwards too. That upon returning from them, loved ones will\
  \ spot within the suitcase of things that is your being, much has changed. You have\
  \ not returned with what you left with. Your breathing is different, your look too.\
  \ Strangely you begin to look more like yourself than anytime before. \n\nReally,\
  \ it is not romance or poetics that has you arriving at yourself. Not for all the\
  \ ways, you have felt native in lands that were other people\u2019s homes, and how\
  \ often this reminds you of the relentless unbelonging you have felt, as a child\
  \ of South Asian immigrants born in \u201CWhere do you come from?\u201D England.\
  \ Or for the way your brown skin deepens into darkness with heat, to speak of impoverishing\
  \ people and time spent with the earth. Instead of weekends in Mykonos and suntan\
  \ lotions, they tried to sell you at Gatwick airport or the other occasions where\
  \ it was permissible to be hauntingly dark without conjuring up the living ghosts\
  \ of colonisation. \nNeither does it account for the way the violence and exhaustion\
  \ of separation force people like you to run towards a return of some sort, not\
  \ knowing where or what that even is. But mostly, not for the way you unpack layers\
  \ of trauma, shifting inner landscapes and dislocate your entire being to excavate\
  \ a space within you. So this place might become a type of home in a world that\
  \ reminds you too often that it was not designed for people like you. \n\nMy Spanish\
  \ does not stretch far enough to share all of these words with Abuelita. I settle\
  \ in silence hoping they might still reach her. What do you say to the woman that\
  \ has seen it all a few times over anyway? \n\nAbuelita puts down the cup she is\
  \ drinking from, her silver bangles clink on the ceramic. Gently, she pushes my\
  \ chin up, tilting my head. Her black eyes now able to observe my throat better:\
  \ a locker of the unspoken things. The void where conversations we cannot have,\
  \ roam freely and quietly. Stirring and stirring. I wonder what she is reading as\
  \ she takes me in some more. Her chest rises as though to speak but she does not\
  \ say anything either. Instead, she replies with a sigh that is the tone and breadth\
  \ of women all across the world right now, it is saying:\n\u201CMe too.\u201D I\
  \ am not sure if I am glad or grieved. We do not have enough language between us\
  \ to confirm, only ways to fold towards one another, into a warmth that is the strangeness\
  \ of our familiar."
