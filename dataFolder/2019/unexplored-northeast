Text: "One day me and my friends decided to go somewhere that very few people have\
  \ been to \nAnd then we found one .. it was Northeast of India .We reached Guwahati\
  \ through flight and then took a cab to shillong , it was about 2000 indian rupees\
  \ from guwahati and we were 4 people so we split the share .\nShillong is a beautiful\
  \ hill station in the northeast .theres a market place in shillong its called police\
  \ bazaar its called PB in short by local Cab drivers there so we went from the hotel\
  \ to PB by local cab . Taxis are the local means of transport in the city . Its\
  \ a buzzing market area with local goods and lots of food to try . Jelebi at Delhi\
  \ mastan is a must eat. We rented motorbikes from PB and decided to explore around\
  \ \nWe have seen few local places and drove to laitlum grand canyon next day morning\
  \ it was very cold that day. The canyons offer a beautiful serene view of the mountain\
  \ stretch.Sitting there sipping red tea (famous in shillong) and watching the Sunset\
  \ will relieve you from any stress.You have shops to eat there the pinapples are\
  \ very plump and juicy and maggie is made in many varieties . Pork is cooked in\
  \ many different ways in shillong its a good place for meat lovers.\nNext day we\
  \ drove to elephant falls and ate samosas in army canteen nearby.\nThen we found\
  \ another waterfall on the way to Cherapunjee (wettest place inthe world) and that\
  \ was called Wahrashi falls, these falls are very sere they have clear water and\
  \ main thing you will be the only people there ..you will only hear the sound of\
  \ gushing waters and birds making the sounds . We took few pictures there sat for\
  \ a while and made a move ..there were other famous falls like 7 sister falls but\
  \ they were dried up.Nohkalikai falls in cherapunjee was a high waterfall with the\
  \ water being turquoise blue ..we can only watch it from a view point and it has\
  \ a history.\nAnd i ve to mention something, In Meghalaya the day starts early and\
  \ ends very quickly by 5 pm it gets darker so we can travel only when the sun is\
  \ out so its warmer .\nThe krangsuri falls is a place where the water is light blue\
  \ and you can swim into the falls I couldnt believe it when i heard of such place\
  \ but you can swim in the falls but in winters the water gets so cold you need to\
  \ be careful. I was freezing it got late for us to start from krangsuri so we had\
  \ to drive from there to mawlynnong at night it was a 2 hour drive and it was freezing\
  \ \nAny way the roads were empty and we reached the airbnb that night. Mawlynnong\
  \ is known as the cleanest village in asia and god it was clean . Every house has\
  \ a bamboo dustbin infront of their homes . The road was clean and garden was everywhere\
  \ the local flowers give beauty to that place and people there are very sweet and\
  \ they know a simple means of living .you wouldnt feel like leaving that place .\
  \ Its also famous for living root bridge .the trees with roots form a natural bridge\
  \ and its a natures beauty from the bridge with a little walk you get to see bangladesh\
  \ border.There are small local shops in mawlynnong where they sell handcrafted items\
  \ and they come for best deals and are very artistic and useful.\nFrom there we\
  \ went to Dawki its known for its clear waters and offers a picturesque view .the\
  \ boats are multicoloured and the water is crystal clear like a green glass . You\
  \ can see the fishes underneath and go boating to go to the end border of india\
  \ and next to you will be the bangladesh border \nYou can see both indians and bangladeshi\
  \ men and police guarding the border. The local cafes in shillong like ML05 , Dylans\
  \ Cafe and Hoitea Toitea offer the best for foodies . \nUnpolluted water falls ,the\
  \ scenic skies, clouds and mountains makes meghalaya an unexplored Serene Beauty."
