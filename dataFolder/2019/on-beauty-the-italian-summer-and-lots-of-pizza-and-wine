Text: "I didn't want to be in love anymore, so I left. I'd been thinking about Aristophanes,\
  \ the Greek who said people used to exist with four arms, four legs, two heads,\
  \ and that life saw us longing for our soul mate. I didn't want to believe in soulmates,\
  \ but I started to think Aristophanes was right; only we aren't trying to find our\
  \ other half, we are running away from it, afraid to be able to see, to touch, the\
  \ one thing in the world that proves our lack of strength, our necessary imbalance.\
  \ \n\nSo, heartbroken and spontaneous, I bought a ticket to Italy. I rescued my\
  \ backpack that hadn't seen the light of day since I explored Europe the year before,\
  \ walked the streets in Budapest my grandparents grew up on, ate what seemed to\
  \ be a whole baguette a day in Paris and read poetry in the sprawling parks of Amsterdam.\
  \ Now I was on a different type of journey; to go somewhere I didn't speak the language,\
  \ but would recognize (I hoped) the feeling in the streets and the beauty in the\
  \ air. Not to mention aperitivo hour, which after 6 weeks in Italy I knew was my\
  \ absolute favourite cultural experience. I am cocktail culture, patio culture,\
  \ riposo culture. Mostly, I am eating pizza everyday for a month and walking 40,000\
  \ steps a day culture. I think I ran away to Italy in the hopes of finding myself,\
  \ which of course I did not (since that's the whole journey isn't it?), but man\
  \ I found something. \n\nMy first stop in Italy; Rome. I stayed in a Hostel that\
  \ said Welcome in pink neon, and I was excited and lonely and free, a traveler again.\
  \ My first day I walked to the Colosseum and my brain exploded. The road that led\
  \ me there sloped upwards, and I saw the massive architectural feat, huge from a\
  \ distance and then closer, and closer, colossal.  And I don't know what happened\
  \ inside me, but I had never known something could be so beautiful. So beautiful,\
  \ it made me think about beauty, real beauty, how I pretend beauty stays where it\
  \ is waiting for me to come back, when really it moves on without me. If I didn't\
  \ pretend I never would have left Rome. Only, I never would have arrived. I would\
  \ still be in Budapest, I would still be in the arms of my first love, I would still\
  \ be lying under the stars in Pennsylvania, I would still be in my mother's womb.\
  \ \n\nSo I am sitting there at the Colosseum in the middle of the day in July, sun\
  \ drawing freckles on my skin, listening to a teenager in a striped shirt play guitar\
  \ to his friends over a glass (well, bottle) of wine, and I can't stop crying, because\
  \ it was so beautiful. And just ephemeral, effervescent, despite the size and stone.\
  \ That day at the Colosseum reminded me why I love to travel. Its always been about\
  \ chasing beauty, in the land or the buildings or the art or the people, and if\
  \ we don't look for it, we won't find it. \n\nLater on during my trip to Italy,\
  \ in Bologna (the city of my dreams), I went to a film festival held in Piazza Maggiore,\
  \ the main square. Two night in a row we watched black and white silent films (with\
  \ Italian and English subtitles, lucky for me). It was mentioned that Martin Scorcese\
  \ was in the audience, along with me and a few thousand sitting in beautifully aligned\
  \ rows of chairs the city had set up. I bought myself a slice of pizza and some\
  \ Peroni and got a seat an hour early, watching the Bolognese day turn to dusk.\
  \ I felt myself crying again, that Colosseum feeling came back to me, of beauty,\
  \ flawless and fleeting. And I was still excited and lonely and free. A traveler,\
  \ and so, so happy. So, I didn't find myself in Italy, but I found the grandiose\
  \ of the Colosseum, a cup of gelato and a book of poetry, of film festivals shared\
  \ by a whole city on a summer night, and I found Italy"
