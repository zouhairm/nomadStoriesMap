Text: "I was a poor, 25-year-old student, spending Christmas in the U.K. with my friend\
  \ Danielle. \n\nIt was a crisp morning when we boarded the ferry to the Isle of\
  \ Mull. The damp haze hanging low in the air, making it hard to see the small birds\
  \ floating alongside our large steel vessel.\n\nWe spent the day hiking through\
  \ the sodden moores of the Inner Hebrides. Following trails, that winded through\
  \ pine trees decorated in Christmas ornaments, waterfalls, and snow covered mountains.\
  \ \n\nThe weather started getting worse by the time we returned to the small ferry\
  \ station in Craignure, the large weathered ferry dock now barely visible through\
  \ the thick Highland haze. \n\nThe weather was expected to get worse, and the ferries\
  \ cancelled indefinitely. \n\nSoggy, tired, and defeated. We sat on the curb next\
  \ to the ferry station and waited. \n\nThat's when we met the local bread man.\n\
  \nHis name is Jon.\n\nJon is a small, balding Scottish man,  who wore a bright yellow\
  \ rain suit. He smelled faintly like tobacco and cinnamon buns and he was willing\
  \ to give us a ride.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was sitting in the middle of the\
  \ cramped three-person truck that I even considered that this could be a bad idea.\
  \ \n\nAs I examined my current situation, Jon swerved in and out of the one-lane\
  \ traffic with laid-back confidence.\n\nI'm a control freak, and I was now at the\
  \ mercy of the local bread-man.\n\nI snapped back to reality as Jon accelerated\
  \ towards a small next pull out, barely missing the small red sports car that was\
  \ racing towards us and I couldn't help but wonder when was the last time he had\
  \ the breaks checked. \n\nWe were waiting under a small canopy at the Fishnish ferry\
  \ crossing, eating warm chips, and brown vinegar, when we learned that Jon was a\
  \ storyteller. \n\nHe told us why the sheep were spray-painted neon pink and green,\
  \ and the unwritten rules of illusive Scottish one-lane highways.\n\nAs we exited\
  \ yet another ferry station, I became more and more confused by his ability to remain\
  \ cheerful. I hate waiting five minutes for a train, let alone take three extra\
  \ ferries at the end of a long day. \n\nWhen I asked Jon if this detour was normal.\
  \ He said you can\u2019t control the ferries. Some days he was home for dinner,\
  \ and other days he was four hours late. \n\nIt wasn't until we were weaving through\
  \ the small valley through Glencoe, that I finally relaxed into the day. It was\
  \ here I began to realize that this unexpected tour with our Scottish storyteller\
  \ took us to places we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise seen, and discovered stories\
  \ we would have otherwise missed if we had gotten on that ferry back in Craignure.\n\
  \nThis trip changed me. In many ways, I\u2019m still a control freak, but I now\
  \ embrace the things that are out of my control. \n\nSometimes getting stranded\
  \ can turn out to be fun. What really matters is your perspective.\n\nI often think\
  \ of Jon when I get too caught up in the chaos of juggling school, work, and a dwindling\
  \ social life. Thinking about that rosy-cheeked Scot reminds me that happiness is\
  \ about accepting challenges head on, and it\u2019s your outlook that makes the\
  \ difference. \n\nAfter all, we are all storytellers. Take the extra ferries, talk\
  \ to strangers, and never stop looking for adventure."
