  \ yeah, literally outside right now, at Corniche beach..\nIt's so silent..i don't\
  \ know if it the first time or after a very long time..but yes, I'm quiet right\
  \ now Inside and out..no one's debating in me about rights and wrongs..inner me\
  \ is quiet.it always tells me what to do and why to do that either I like it or\
  \ no.so yes..its surprising for me to make myself this quiet :)\nIm hearing sounds\
  \ though but it's the pleasant noice of vehicles that are passing by the road behind\
  \ me, the sound of little harmless waves crashing at the bank and this buzzing sound\
  \ from trees and plants..some night insects..ch ch ch ch..i don't know what they\
  \ are feeling bad about.\nThe helicopter's wings noise and then that white yaught's\
  \ motor, I wonder who's going in that at this hour and then the sound of these foot\
  \ step of few people who are walking. I wonder why at this hour ? It's almost 4\
  \ in the morning or maybe they're trying find the same thing I'm looking for. I\
  \ wanna memorize it all for someday...\nSomeday ??\nIt's my *someday*.. I always\
  \ wanted to do this at this way in this hour and I'm having it..\nI'm living my\
  \ someday.No matter how hard I try.. I won't be able to click this scene and save\
  \ it in my phone. \nI can't.. it just can stay in my heart like this."
