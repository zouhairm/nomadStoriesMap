Text: "Bus arriving in three minutes.\n\nTuhtuhtuhtuh! My feet take rapid turns tapping\
  \ the pavement, propelling me up the hill. I can\u2019t miss this bus. Even though\
  \ it\u2019s freezing out, my face quickly moistens as my eyes search through the\
  \ blinding sunlight reflecting off of parked cars. A left glance through an alleyway\
  \ reveals a mountain of dirt I\u2019ve never seen before on the next street over.\
  \ Eyes squinting and limbs darting, I think, \u201CWhat the...\u201D?\n\nEarlier\
  \ on...\n\n\u201CYo...don't...move\u201D, the warning pressed through the fragile\
  \ atmosphere from my mouth, each syllable elongated in a still, stringent tone,\
  \ as my body clutches the black, rocky ground, ready to jet at any moment. My friend\
  \ sat completely still on a rusty, blue swing beside me. Our eyes trained on the\
  \ only lights in the darkness. The headlights of a car slowly inched down the street,\
  \ surveying everything. The only thing separating us were the remnants of a tall,\
  \ silver, chain link fence now mangled and consumed by vicious vines and a single\
  \ layer of unkempt woods. I sensed the wrath behind the headlights, and the person\
  \ containing it.\n\nEast of the River in the southeast quadrant of Washington, DC\
  \ is considered the most dangerous part of town, yet that didn\u2019t keep my friend\
  \ and I from taking a 10pm stroll down to the Anacostia River. We listened to the\
  \ tranquil flow of water, watched blue lights on the bridge twinkle between lands,\
  \ and felt the welcoming autumn breeze embrace us. Our phones had died, and I told\
  \ my mom I\u2019d be out for ten minutes. Ten minutes meant three hours, but she\
  \ didn\u2019t know. I knew trouble awaited if caught, so we scurried back home through\
  \ the neighborhood, when a car zoomed down my street.\n\n\u201CUh ohhh\u201D, my\
  \ friend said. We raced the car before it could turn onto the street we were on,\
  \ and, as if nature was on our side, an opening we had never seen before became\
  \ visible. Just as the car had turned, we disappeared into darkness.\n\nBus arriving\
  \ in two minutes. \n\nAs I bend the corner, an apartment building shields me from\
  \ the fierce light rays, and I see the dirt mountain clearer. It\u2019s a construction\
  \ site. No unkempt woods or vines, the schoolhouses that towered above are now being\
  \ towered by yellow-vested men, and the rusty swing is gone. It can\u2019t be.\n\
  \nBack to earlier...\n\nEverything slowed as the car and us came face to face. Our\
  \ breathing flowed in and out with the enveloping breeze, which gently swayed the\
  \ branches and leaves along the ground. \u201CDoes she see us?\u201D, floated into\
  \ my mind, but at that exact moment, the car continued down the street. We had made\
  \ it!\n\nBus arriving in one minute.\n\nI made it to the bus stop, heart pounding\
  \ and nauseated. I look at the site and the first sign on it says \u2018Costello\
  \ Construction\u201D. Sadness and anger stirs within me. DC is undergoing gentrification,\
  \ and my community is caught in the wave. Families I grew up with have been forced\
  \ to move out entirely, because they can no longer afford to live in the place they\
  \ grew up. Construction sites are depressing sights to many here, including me.\n\
  \nHowever, the second sign says a school is being built there. I remember the night\
  \ we discovered the rusty swing as the wild vines and woods invited us misfits in.\
  \ My heart calms, the anger dissipates, and my mindset renews.\n\nThis is my community.\
  \ Despite who or what comes and goes, the memories will remain. I\u2019m connected\
  \ to this land, a part of its history. The streets I ran through as a kid and river\
  \ I risked it all to see was one chapter in our story. Now, we\u2019re both entering\
  \ a new one, an unknown one, and I\u2019m ok with that.\n\nBus arriving. \n\nBeeping\
  \ sounds from the bus brings my attention back. The doors spring open, I step on,\
  \ and find a window seat. I was running, but I honestly don\u2019t have a clue where\
  \ I\u2019m going, and I\u2019m okay with that, too.  All I know is the clock was\
  \ ticking, and I couldn\u2019t miss the bus."
