Text: "\u201CBeing in Delhi is not the best time to be extra trusting to strangers\u201D\
  . That\u2019s what my Indian friends told me before leaving New Zealand for a do-it-myself\
  \ cultural and heritage tour in New Delhi and Agra. I didn\u2019t want it to spoil\
  \ my excitement so I just brushed that off my mind. \n\nAfter spending five days\
  \ in Kolkata for my friend\u2019s wedding, I flew to Delhi and everything seemed\
  \ smooth until I went out of the New Delhi Railway Station in Paharganj, known to\
  \ be one of the most dangerous places in Delhi.  I knew my budget hotel was just\
  \ close by so I wasn\u2019t too worried about the hassle of having to look for an\
  \ auto rickshaw, India\u2019s version of tuk-tuk. It was about dusk and the crowd\
  \ outside the station was too overwhelming that it instantly confused me whether\
  \ to go straight, left or right. Old school that I am, I prefer asking people over\
  \ mobile apps for directions. I approached a man in uniform and asked for directions.\
  \ He looked bothered and immediately warned me that Delhi was in red alert due to\
  \ the recent bombing in Kashmir and that India and Pakistan might go into war any\
  \ moment.  \n\nHe called an auto driver and instructed him to drive me to a \u201C\
  government agency\u201D intended to assist tourists. Since I\u2019ve never been\
  \ that scared for my life, I willingly submitted and even thanked him for all those\
  \ warnings. Next thing I knew, I was inside a small office and being asked of some\
  \ personal information and my travel itinerary. Apparently, it was a tourist agency\
  \ who wanted me to avail their tour packages. I started suspecting something was\
  \ wrong, so I tweaked some of my answers. When they realized that I\u2019m not a\
  \ typical tourist willing to shell out a fortune, they allowed me to go without\
  \ saying a word, making me feel like a useless victim. The same auto drive was waiting\
  \ for me outside. Still feeling afraid, I begged him to drop me to my hotel. I was\
  \ charged a whopping 500 Rupees, ten times larger than the usual fare. He dropped\
  \ me to a place where I had to tackle a long stretch of stores and had to deal with\
  \ hawkers and touts every step of the way. With sharp eyes, he warned me not to\
  \ tell anyone about what happened. It took me 20 more minutes to reach my hotel\
  \ where I cried to the receptionist, calmed down and eventually got a room. I was\
  \ too beat that I immediately jumped to bed and ignored the buzzy and bitey mosquitoes.\
  \ \n\nThe following morning, I woke up to a view of the Paharganj\u2019s  littered\
  \ rooftops, with the lovely sunrise, a flying dove and the three-coloured Indian\
  \ flag proudly waving, as if telling me to get to know the country better. The next\
  \ two days in Delhi and a day in Agra were the most challenging solo adventures\
  \ I had and I don\u2019t regret paying a visit to these places. More than the UNESCO\
  \ heritage monuments, mausoleums and temples I\u2019ve visited, it was the action\
  \ and drama-packed scenes I\u2019ve witnessed that made this journey one for the\
  \ books.\nI braved the never-ending honkings in the city, the air pollution, the\
  \ disrespected pedestrian lanes and the crowded buses and trains. The homeless made\
  \ me feel guilty, the persistent hawkers made me realize how hard it is to earn\
  \ money in many parts of the world, while the smog and mosquitoes both reminded\
  \ me of simpler things I complained about back home. The poverty in many corners\
  \ of the city showed me how complex the world\u2019s problems are. \n\nBeing in\
  \ India for 10 days was surprisingly incredible in many ways and it is probably\
  \ one of my life\u2019s most unforgettable trips. On my way home, while reflecting\
  \ on my takeaways from this trip, the one which resonated the loudest was Gandhi\u2019\
  s message to Indians. You know you made the right decisions when they are directed\
  \ to making life easier for the poorest and most helpless men in the country. As\
  \ an engineer, I got more inspired to do my share."
