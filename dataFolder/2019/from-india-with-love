Text: "I traveled to India for a corneal transplant and woe unto me, the universe\
  \ had other plans for me. I was admitted on arrival at the Hospital and booked as\
  \ the first patient for surgery at 8 am the following morning. One of the prerequisites\
  \ for surgery is a blood test to show the complete blood count (CBC), and as the\
  \ nurses too out my blood, I couldn't help ask If they'd run an HIV test. \"Of course\"\
  , she answered and I was scared since I had been very promiscuous. The hospital\
  \ staff were punctual and I was being prepped for surgery, one of the nurses accidentally\
  \ left my file after injecting the anesthesia and glanced to see who my donor was\
  \ and the results of the HIV test. I guess I felt sad that the 33 yr old lady donor\
  \ had to die of chest complications and me be the recipient of her cornea, and that\
  \ her family had not been notified of any of her organs being donated; however,\
  \ the realization that I was HIV negative and the thought of seeing properly again,\
  \ overshadowed the brief spell of grief. I was in and out of consciousness throughout\
  \ the surgery but vividly remember my old cornea being cut off and the new cornea\
  \ being stitched on.  \nRecovery started out tough as I wasn't allowed to read,\
  \ watch telly or take long walks because of the risk of straining and infecting\
  \ the eyes and thus had to spend most of the time indoors. As the adage goes, 'the\
  \ way to a man's heart is through the stomach'; my desire to eat non-Indian food\
  \ led to me looking for KFC or any other fast food joint within the vicinity. Luckily,\
  \ I found someone who gave directions to a fast food joint a km away from the hospital\
  \ and since he spoke better English than most Indians I'd met, I was curious about\
  \ his occupation. \"I am an English trainer at Gracia Maria Ielts & Academy of English\"\
  , he replied and invited me to one of his classes. The class was in a small 3m *\
  \ 2m room with a rattling fan hanging in the middle and shortly after Arun (the\
  \ trainer) asked me to introduce myself and ended up taking over his class since\
  \ all of the students were eager to speak to a foreigner. The evening class was\
  \ almost like the first until Betty arrived, she was a bit shy at first and gained\
  \ courage soon after. Betty spoke better English than the trainer and that caused\
  \ tension since she would often correct the trainer. Betty and I spent the next\
  \ 3 weeks in constant communication and at first tried to keep it purely school\
  \ stuff but it quickly turned into an illegal affair because the Indian culture\
  \ did not allow it. Thus, we spent most of the time talking on phone apart from\
  \ the evening class, which I had taken over from Arun on request from the other\
  \ students. 3 weeks flew by and I had to fly back to Nairobi via Ethiopia but the\
  \ thought of leaving Betty was tough but I had to leave. I had a hard time finding\
  \ the Ethiopian Airlines counter because of grogginess from sleeping on the previous\
  \ flight from Kochi, and decided to find an Ethiopian to help since they're very\
  \ loyal to their airline. I found one and soon after we were at the counter. I couldn't\
  \ connect to the airport Wi-Fi and asked Hareg (the Ethiopian) for help. 5 hours\
  \ later, Hareg and I were still talking and had exchanged her peanuts from Singapore\
  \ with the Indian ones I had. The counter had opened and the Ethiopian airlines'\
  \ crew, unfortunately tried to get us to seat together since Hareg had told them\
  \ she was my wife. She had just divorced the father of her 2 boys and was in love\
  \ with me. She asked me to go to Ethiopia instead since we couldn't part so soon\
  \ after meeting and I obliged. After making love on arrival, I wondered how Betty\
  \ would have felt had she found out I hadn't gotten home."
