Text: "The spiralling stone staircase twisted sharply as I climbed, the single light\
  \ bulb at the bottom not strong enough to reach up into the darkness. I had a tight\
  \ grip on the rope fixed to the rough wall, but it would only take one wrong step\
  \ to send me tumbling to the bottom. I cautiously worked my way upward and managed\
  \ a sigh of relief when I stepped into my room.\n\nI was staying in the tower room\
  \ in Auberge de la Halle, an old hotel in the medieval town of Cordes sur Ciel in\
  \ southern France.  The blonde stone walls and lace-curtained bed were reminiscent\
  \ of another era. There were few rooms in the hotel and I appeared to be the only\
  \ occupant for the night. An old metal key and the side door allowed me to come\
  \ and go as I pleased.\n\nI visited Cordes sur Ciel when I was in France recently,\
  \ looking after a friend\u2019s home. It was unlike any other village I\u2019d seen\
  \ in my limited travels. Perched high above the farmland, Cordes, as it was originally\
  \ known and is still called today, can be seen from miles away. The town was strategically\
  \ placed to protect the residents from whatever dangerous forces were in the countryside\
  \ below. One of the region\u2019s first fortified towns, its main buildings date\
  \ back to the 1200s. \n\nThe stone walls around Cordes are thick and still strong\
  \ after 800 years.  For those brave enought to walk from the newer section of the\
  \ town below, it takes effort and determination to climb to the top.  The town centre\
  \ consists of restaurants, hotels and shops, and after business hours, the streets\
  \ are almost deserted.\n\nAs I explored in the evening sun, for the most part, I\
  \ was the only person about. The aloof, but curious, stray cats were my only company.\
  \ I wandered silent, empty streets and flower lined alleys, and examined weary wooden\
  \ doorways and worn stonework.   Stopping for a rest on an old stone bench along\
  \ the wall, I was an unseen observer watching life pass by below. \n\nEach corner\
  \ revealed another impressive street or alley that demanded exploring, and for hours,\
  \ I was lost in time. Stepping on those cobblestones worn shiny smooth, I wondered\
  \ about the people who walked there over the centuries - villagers, merchants, traders,\
  \ soldiers. What was life like back then? Difficult? Happier? It most certainly\
  \ would have been simpler. If those old stone walls could talk, what stories would\
  \ they tell? \n\nExperiencing the town this way made me realize what my previous\
  \ trips were missing. What had been lacking all along was authenticity, getting\
  \ to know the \u201Crealness\u201D of a place. \n\nFor many travellers, European\
  \ trips consist of visits to the big places - Paris, Rome, Barcelona. As those usual\
  \ tourist spots get busier and more congested each year, it becomes harder to have\
  \ a positive experience. Jostling elbow to elbow with hundreds, if not thousands,\
  \ of tourists in a congested city square or venue steals much of the joy of visiting\
  \ a new place.\n\nOf course, the big cities are important and are still exciting\
  \ to visit. They are popular for a reason and are interesting in their own right.\
  \ But away from those centres, far from the tourists and crowds, a visitor gets\
  \ a real feeling of a country. \n\nThis short trip was far different from my usual\
  \ travel nights of hotel room and tv. I saw normal life as it was lived there, not\
  \ sights and scenery simply packaged for tourists. It was an experience unlike any\
  \ other I'd had before.\n\nI returned to my temporary home with a new plan for my\
  \ future adventures. What started out as a simple overnight stay somewhere unusual,\
  \ resulted in an entirely new approach to travel, and maybe, life in general. \n\
  \nSometimes, getting away from the usual and \u201Cnormal\u201D is more than a simple\
  \ adventure."
