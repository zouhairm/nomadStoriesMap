Text: "At the intersection of the Amazon, the Andes, and the Equator, there exists\
  \ one of the most biodiverse places on Earth \u2013 Yasun\xED National Park, locally\
  \ known as \"El Yasun\xED.\" Right next to it, there is an unassuming village called\
  \ Nuevo Rocafuerte. When I planned my visit to the jungle, I only predicted my fascination\
  \ with \"El Yasun\xED.\" Yasun\xED makes Ecuadorians the proudest, and bird watchers\
  \ the craziest, and it rendered incredible memories during my 2018 trip there. However,\
  \ it was Nuevo Rocafuerte that stole my attention, to the point of becoming my year-long\
  \ thesis topic.\n \n        \tNuevo Rocafuerte is located in the easternmost tip\
  \ of Ecuador\u2019s Amazon rainforest, bordering Peru. Most people think I\u2019\
  m crazy for choosing such a remote town as the case study for my research because\
  \ getting there is a challenge most people aren\u2019t willing to go through. To\
  \ reach this place from the capital city, Quito, it takes a seven-hour bus ride\
  \ east, followed by a nine-hour boat ride down Napo River (which becomes the Amazon\
  \ river once it reaches Peru). Nuevo Rocafuerte\u2019s rundown streets and deteriorated\
  \ houses scream political neglect. Nevertheless, its people are enchanting! They\
  \ know their authorities have forgotten them, yet they live blissfully and slowly.\
  \ They reminded me of working-class New Yorkers. Both are people that understand\
  \ the intimidating richness that surrounds them and still carry on with their humble\
  \ routines day after day. I realized Nuevo Rocafuerte and \"Nueva York\" have similarities.\
  \ For one, \"Nueva York\" is a concrete jungle and Nuevo Rocafuerte is deep in the\
  \ jungle.\n \n        \tYasun\xED attracts national and international tourists,\
  \ whereas Nuevo Rocafuerte mainly attracts neighboring locals. On my first visit,\
  \ I observed life in this village. On my second visit, I talked to locals and listened\
  \ to their stories, and on one of my last days, I met a soccer team from a nearby\
  \ commune. They were visiting to use the soccer fields there and were returning\
  \ home after their game. They invited me to come along and offered to show me their\
  \ hometown, which was on the riverbank some twenty minutes upstream. Twenty minutes\
  \ sounded easy. Little did I know they would be the scariest but fondest moments\
  \ of my journey.\n \nI embarked on a ten-people-canoe with twenty-seven soccer players.\
  \ Naturally, I felt unsafe, but their laughter and nonchalant attitude pointed to\
  \ no danger. I had been practicing staying present for some weeks before this trip.\
  \ \u201CFear not, this will be a great spiritual practice,\u201D I thought to myself\
  \ as the canoe balanced exaggeratedly from left to right. The canoe was so heavy\
  \ and low, we could\u2019ve tipped over at any moment. When fear became intense,\
  \ I desperately anchored my attention to my breath and turned my gaze away from\
  \ the muddy river; the water seemed too close to the canoe\u2019s rim. I began noticing\
  \ the cloudy sky. It had a shimmery silver-blue color with sun rays filtering from\
  \ between the impenetrable clouds. I then noticed the colossal number of trees in\
  \ the distance. I thought to myself, \u201CThe canopies are as dense as New York\u2019\
  s skyline and the Amazon has tall trees instead of skyscrapers...\u201D\n\n    \
  \    \tLiving in the present is a challenge for an avid daydreamer. I went from\
  \ being in the now, to thinking about all the similarities I could find between\
  \ Nuevo Rocafuerte and \"Nueva York.\" \u201CNew Yorkers also suffer political neglect,\u201D\
  \ I thought, and suddenly, a scare hit. Literally. A brown trout of about a foot\
  \ long had jumped from the river into our canoe and it jumped its way towards me,\
  \ slapping me directly across the face! No one in the boat had ever witnessed such\
  \ a thing! Naturally, everyone burst out in laughter and I laughed with them while\
  \ cleaning the scales off my face. It was amid the laughter that I registered the\
  \ privilege I was experiencing being a part of their fearless life. With everyone\
  \ turning their bodies to check out what had happened to me, I imagine that the\
  \ canoe rocked even more than before, but I didn\u2019t notice the movement. In\
  \ that moment of laughter, I simply felt there, connected to them, connected to\
  \ the vastness, and at ease with the now."
