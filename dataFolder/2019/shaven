Text: "\u201CThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m cutting my hair,\u201D I write him, looking\
  \ at my long, black hair reflected in the window of a third-wave, Dutch coffeeshop.\
  \ \u201CBut I wouldn\u2019t mind meeting up for lunch.\u201D\nHe tells me he\u2019\
  s been a hairstylist for ten years. Originally from India, but getting his MBA in\
  \ Amsterdam. Hair, however, is really what he loved. \n\u201CI contact travelers,\
  \ cut their hair, and then donate it,\u201D his text reads. Normal, that\u2019s\
  \ totally normal, I think to myself. \u201CYou\u2019d really pull off a pixie cut,\u201D\
  \ he continues, I laugh nervously in an empty metro car and stare out the window.\
  \ Earth tones. Brick buildings. Hundreds of brown leaves littered across wet sidewalks,\
  \ canals, and bike seats. Amsterdam was beautiful even in the rain, I think. \u201C\
  I don\u2019t have the face for that,\u201D I reply.\nWe meet at his favorite restaurant\
  \ way outside the center of the city. Sushanth has thick, curly hair that he wears\
  \ in a loose bun, a frizzy beard, and a scraggly mustache that sits uncomfortably\
  \ on his face. He has an almost cartoonish raspy voice yet made anything sound like\
  \ a quote right out of a zen-buddhist calendar. \u201CYou know,\u201D he remembers,\
  \ \u201Cyou would look really good with short hair.\u201D I let out a small burst\
  \ of laughter. \n\u201CI\u2019m not doing it,\u201D I confirm. I look him right\
  \ in the eye. Sushanth looks back at me, skeptically.\nBack at his dorm room, I\
  \ find myself venting about my waning flame in Portugal and my frustrating new crush\
  \ in Madrid. \u201CI\u2019ve always been self-conscious of my masculine tendencies.\
  \ I grew up with three older brothers. I\u2019m confident, funny--I\u2019m always\
  \ the one to make the first move. But I don\u2019t know, I just feel like guys aren\u2019\
  t really into that, you know?\u201D Sushanth listens intently as I speak. For a\
  \ moment, I forget that he's a total stranger. I man I literally just met few hours\
  \ earlier through a traveling app on my phone. I pause for a moment and twirl my\
  \ hair between my fingers. \nQuietly, Sushanth gets up from his bed and starts rummaging\
  \ through his dresser. \"Genesis,\" he says, finally pulling out clippers and a\
  \ pair of shiny, silver scissors, \u201CI would never cut the hair off someone who\
  \ wasn\u2019t ready for it.\" \nI sit anxiously in a chair with a plastic apron\
  \ fastened around my neck. My mami is going to kill me, I think. Sushanth walks\
  \ over to me, grabs a chunk of hair from the right side of my face, and with his\
  \ fancy, hairstylist scissors, cuts the entire chunk off. I watch silently as hundreds\
  \ of hair strands float softly to the ground, scattered all around me like the leaves\
  \ outside. I flinch infinitely as I feel the vibration of the buzzing clipper on\
  \ my scalp for the very first time, imagining myself as my brothers getting their\
  \ hair cut, unphased. \nSuddenly, the buzzing stops. The sound of snipping scissors\
  \ cease. The apron is removed from around my neck. I slowly get up from my chair,\
  \ tip-toe across Sunshanth's dirty floor, my ex-hair--parts of my old self--fighting\
  \ to find its way between my toes. \nIn the bathroom, I glance in the mirror, and\
  \ gasp. With a half-shaven head, a short, black bob, and an incredulous smile, for\
  \ the first time in a long time, I finally say myself."
