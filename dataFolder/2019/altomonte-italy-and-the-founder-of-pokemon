Text: "Located high up in Southern Italy\u2019s Cosenza Province, the medieval town\
  \ of Altomonte (literally translated as \u2018high mountain\u2019) overlooks the\
  \ Esaro Valley in majestic and breathtaking fashion. Home to about 4,400 people,\
  \ Altomonte\u2019s culture pays extensive homage to what Italy has been famous for,\
  \ for centuries -- good wine (ancient Balbini wine, to be exact), flourishing olive\
  \ groves, and a history that is highly saturated with Christian influence. One trip\
  \ to Altomonte is a literal blast from the past, as a walk through its roller coaster-esque\
  \ streets is speckled with 14th- and 15th-century architectural works, plenty of\
  \ great, local restaurants with traditional Italian cuisine, and even an open-air\
  \ theatre to boot.\nAbove all else, the people of Altomonte are the main attraction,\
  \ as they have been highly and continuously praised for their hospitality and welcoming\
  \ attitudes. When taking all of this in, there\u2019s no wonder why the town puts\
  \ on around 300 weddings every year; people from all over Italy just can\u2019t\
  \ seem to overlook this romantic setting.\n\tWhen I visited Altomonte in the summer\
  \ of 2017, I was lucky enough to feel such hospitality firsthand, maybe even at\
  \ an exponential level. I think this had to do with the fact that although Altomonte's\
  \ residents are used to visitors from throughout Italy, having visitors from other\
  \ parts of the globe is almost newsworthy in town. I remember walking down the street\
  \ and being met with stares from every angle, as everyone had been waiting for my\
  \ Italian professor (an Altomonte native) to bring his American students there for\
  \ the summer (as he did annually). Although our group was nowhere near fluent in\
  \ Italian, we were treated with the utmost respect and always greeted happily and\
  \ patiently by our hosts. It took me no time to realize that Altomonte\u2019s seemingly\
  \ unconditional hospitality was something to be deeply appreciated. However, I would\
  \ soon come to understand that this same unconditional hospitality could be easily\
  \ exploited as well.\nThis became evident when I learned that the founder of the\
  \ hit Japanese video game and Anime \u2018Pokemon\u2019 had allegedly made permanent\
  \ residence in Altomonte.\n\u201CUmm, what?! Are you serious?! You mean to tell\
  \ me that Satoshi Tajiri lives HERE? No way!\u201D\nNo way, indeed, Ryan. No way,\
  \ indeed.\n\tYou see, It wasn\u2019t long before we learned that we were not the\
  \ only Americans staying in Altomonte: a supposedly rich American editor had made\
  \ it his home and had heavy influence in town. Everywhere we went, there was something\
  \ to be said about him, from stories about how he founded Altomonte\u2019s Memorial\
  \ Library for Children to the supposedly insane parties and orgies he threw. \n\
  Weird? Maybe, but he sounded like something of a local legend. A local legend for\
  \ sure, because he somehow convinced the Altomonte faithful that he was the true\
  \ creator of \u2018Pokemon!\u2019 \n\u201CBut wait, his story could have some merit!\
  \ Maybe he still helped work on \u2018Pokemon.\u2019 He was probably just mistranslated\
  \ or something.\u201D\nI thought so, too. I knew I needed evidence. One Google search\
  \ later, I found that the only results that matched him with \u2018Pokemon\u2019\
  \ were all from Altomonte\u2019s tourist and hospitality websites.  My mind was\
  \ BLOWN.\n\tFrom the moment I uncovered this man\u2019s admittedly clever but exploitative\
  \ ruse, I was met with somewhat of a moral struggle -- Do I expose him, hurt his\
  \ reputation, and make Altomonte\u2019s residents out to be fools? Or do I let go\
  \ of my social justice warrior attitude and leave the concerns of Altomonte out\
  \ of my business? \nA truly hard decision indeed, but in the end, I learned that\
  \ any effort to expose him was futile. He had sunk his teeth in too deep, gained\
  \ the trust of all the land of Altomonte, and no one was going to ruin it for him.\
  \ Not a single soul I talked to could be convinced that an Italian-American named\
  \ Josh wasn\u2019t the creator of an East Asian-turned-global phenomenon. Meh, you\
  \ win some, you lose some, I guess. At least I can say I left Altomonte with some\
  \ pretty important life lessons: Whatever you do, don\u2019t exploit the kindness\
  \ of the people who are welcoming you into their home, and beware of your local\
  \ \u2018Pokemon\u2019 creator."
