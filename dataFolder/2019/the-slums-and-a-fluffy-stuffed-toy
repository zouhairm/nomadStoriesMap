Text: "The Slums and a Fluffy, Stuffed Toy\n\n7:30pm. Right now, my exhaustion and\
  \ resultant emotions crowded the desire to go and make a difference. The muddy,\
  \ faded red taxi was rounding the last corner before we entered The Slums. Most\
  \ of us could not pronounce the name of the area, about a thirty minute drive outside\
  \ of Chiang Mai, Thailand, where we were teaching English to underprivileged children.\n\
  \nFaint light was spilling from the window of a tiny box-shaped house comprised\
  \ of one room only \u2013 plain and with no decorations or furniture. Eager, ever-smiling,\
  \ brown-eyed faces appeared in the doorway. Tonight, their smiles could be seen\
  \ miles away, even under the dimmest of street lights \u2013 tonight, was special!\
  \  \n\nIt had been three challenging, magical, dream-fulfilling and utterly exhausting\
  \ weeks of an outreach which would complete a 6-month Personal Development school\
  \ which I was attending. I had started this school because I needed to find myself\
  \ after a messy divorce. My thoughts were scattered between missing home; back in\
  \ South Africa; and my need to reach out and do something good for those who were\
  \ so obviously in great need and simply being emotionally drained. Right now, the\
  \ last thing I wanted to do was explain verbs and nouns to children who had no idea\
  \ what we were saying. In The Land of Smiles, the language barrier had been a much\
  \ greater challenge than I ever expected!\n\nJoyful shouts filled my ears. Strong,\
  \ young hands grabbed at us as we exited the taxi. The excitement on these children\u2019\
  s faces was unmatched to any I had ever seen. Innocent, gleaming eyes danced. They\
  \ knew they had to complete their lesson first and humbly sat down on the once white\
  \ tile floor. English lessons came first. No matter how long their school day had\
  \ been or how many chores they had completed. If you couldn\u2019t speak English,\
  \ you couldn\u2019t ever hope to find a better job.\n\nAided by our translator,\
  \ Big (this was his English name as translated from Thai, which caused quite some\
  \ amusement to us, as most Thai people were significantly smaller than us Boer-Afrikaners),\
  \ we managed to complete a somewhat successful lesson. A beautiful little deaf and\
  \ dumb girl had crept closer to me tonight, and was huddled up in a cross legged\
  \ bundle of curiosity. \nWe were still erasing the white board, when there was a\
  \ stirring at the back of the room. Controlled whispers turned into giggles. Twelve\
  \ and thirteen year old boys were not able to sit still any longer, but an elder\
  \ entered and they managed to once again, obey. Discipline was strict, in the city\
  \ schools as well as The Slums. \n\nFinally, an older Thai man and blonde American\
  \ lady appeared, carrying a huge, slightly worn cardboard box. It was a special\
  \ shipment from America. Generous families had donated unwanted items and it was\
  \ being distributed to the underprivileged areas around Chiang Mai. This specific\
  \ box was a treasure chest. My heart jumped with surprise as the first pink, fluffy\
  \ stuffed animal appeared from it. Soft toys? What on earth would teenagers do with\
  \ SOFT TOYS?? Back home, they were nagging parents for even more expensive IPhones\
  \ and gaming consoles\u2026\nThen, the most heart wrenching, but heart-warming moment\
  \ I had ever witnessed, unfolded right in front of me. The assortment of blue, pink\
  \ and other colored fluffy toys were handed out one by one. The boys were holding\
  \ their gifts lovingly and when a mobile phone appeared they were hardly able to\
  \ stand still for the three seconds it took to take their picture. They were overjoyed.\
  \ They had received a GIFT, a TOY!! I couldn\u2019t stop the tears. This moment\
  \ had changed my life dramatically!\n\nI kept staring at those laughing, shiny faces\
  \ under those faint, dirty streetlights as we were leaving The Slums for the last\
  \ time. For one night, these children had known what happiness was, what it felt\
  \ like to be remembered, to mean something, to someone. I had never expected to\
  \ start finding myself, my purpose, here \u2013 but for years to come, that one\
  \ moment and one precious photo - would remind me of the truly meaningful things\
  \ in life."
