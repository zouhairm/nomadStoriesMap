Text: "There is no ideal way to lose your passport.\n\nMine has vanished somewhere\
  \ between Budapest and Brussels, and now I am on my way to throw myself at the mercy\
  \ of the U.S. consulate in Amsterdam and beg for a temporary replacement. From Maastricht,\
  \ the southern capital of the Netherlands, the journey by train takes two and a\
  \ half hours. But if there is a nicer train journey in Europe, I\u2019ve yet to\
  \ find it. It's March, spring has come early, and carpeted fields of splendid green\
  \ unroll into the horizon. Punctuated by small cottages and flat winding creeks,\
  \ the Dutch countryside is a bucolic daydream passing quickly by my window.\n\n\
  Though the scenery is a consolation, the reverie ends at Nijmegen. A man enters\
  \ my carriage with a stream of commuters, and, like a dog that can sense human despair,\
  \ seizes the opportunity to squeeze himself next to me despite an abundance of unoccupied\
  \ chairs. He smells terrible, body odor with something unfamiliar. On his lap he\
  \ holds a wooden crate with tiny holes drilled into the top, and there is something\
  \ moving inside of it. Many somethings.\n\nThere is no ideal way to lose your passport,\
  \ and it is even less ideal to lose it then spend two hours sitting next to an unwashed\
  \ stranger. But Koen, as he quickly introduces himself, is nothing if a determined\
  \ conversationalist. I have been told the Dutch are a direct, straight-forward people,\
  \ and Koen is this incarnation to the extreme. He ignores my attempts to read a\
  \ book or look out the window. I surrender to his barrage of questions: Where are\
  \ you from? How long have you been studying here? You lost your what? \n\nInside\
  \ their darkened crate, the pigeons make no noise apart from the shuffling of their\
  \ feet against the wire floor. Through the tiny holes appear glimpses of a silvery\
  \ wing, a talon. To my untrained eye they look like completely ordinary pigeons,\
  \ yet Koen assures me they are sourced from the finest racing pigeon breeder in\
  \ Belgium. \u201CMike Tyson buys his birds from the same man,\u201D he tells me.\
  \ \u201CThey cost anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 euros, because they are pedigree\
  \ pigeons, the fastest in the world.\u201D \n\nKoen gives me a tour of the inside\
  \ of his backpack. There is a 1 liter canteen \u201Cfrom his soldier days,\u201D\
  \ which looks like a completely ordinary water bottle. There are also whole chocolate\
  \ chip cookies rolling around loose in there, sans container or packaging. \u201C\
  My girlfriend,\u201D he says, like this explains it, \u201Cbaked them this morning.\u201D\
  \ He offers me one. I decline.\n\n\u201CAnd this,\u201D he says, extracting an expensive\
  \ leather portfolio from the crumbly contents of his backpack, \u201Care the pedigree\
  \ papers.\u201D His hands dance over the pages, unable to contain his excitement.\
  \ I don\u2019t read Dutch, but it looks official. \n\n\u201CThey don\u2019t have\
  \ any names,\u201D I observe. One page depicts the pedigree breeding lineage of\
  \ the pigeons, a long family tree of serial numbers descending into more serial\
  \ numbers, without description or imagination.\n\n\u201CI will name one after you,\u201D\
  \ Koen promises.  \n\nAlthough not one to warm quickly to strangers, I am touched\
  \ by his gesture. For the next two hours, as he explains the intricacies of long\
  \ distance pigeon racing to me, I hold my breath and do not worry about my passport.\
  \ \n\nHe gives me a friendly nod and departs at Zwolle, both arms wrapped around\
  \ his extraordinary cargo. In Amsterdam, the consulate refuses to give me a temporary\
  \ passport in lieu of waiting weeks for the replacement paperwork to go through.\
  \ I will have to cancel all trips outside of the country for the next month, including\
  \ my already scheduled tour of Spain. Hundreds of euros down the drain. But what\
  \ can you do? There is no ideal way to lose your passport.\n\nOutside the Rijksmuseum,\
  \ the first tulips of the year seem unusually vibrant, their very existence an act\
  \ of defiance in the face of the evening chill. As I flex my fingers in the cold\
  \ and anticipate the long ride back to Maastricht, I force myself to remember: I\u2019\
  m in the Netherlands. It\u2019s March. Somewhere out there, there\u2019s a pigeon\
  \ with my name."
