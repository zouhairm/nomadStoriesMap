Text: "We had come to Kotor in Montenegro to visit the famed Lovcen National Park\
  \ and Mausoleum proudly built at its highest point.\n\nIgnoring the tour office\
  \ sentiments that 'No-one walks there, we just drive!', we set off up the steep\
  \ ascent. Exhausted but exhilarated at making it to the top, we took in the 360\
  \ Degree panorama of Lovcen National Park and surrounding regions of Montenegro,\
  \ Bosnia & Herzegovina and Albania. Feeling awestruck to be standing on one point\
  \ and seeing all of those areas simultaneously was soon overshadowed by the pressing\
  \ matter of getting home before nightfall. The late hour precluded us from walking\
  \ home to Kotor, and the choice was made to start walking with the idea of flagging\
  \ down a passing motorist.\n\nWe quickly calculated the remaining provisions we\
  \ had to see us through a night on the mountain just as a car trundled up beside\
  \ us. The car, looking every bit its 30 years and the size of a mini minor had a\
  \ trailer full of vegetables on the back. The two occupants within shared 155 years\
  \ between them and were enthusiastically gesturing for us to jump in the backseat.\
  \ Excitedly we opened the door with the deepest gratitude at having been spared\
  \ a night in the wilderness. This appreciation overflowed when the driver motioned\
  \ for us to eat one of the freshly picked apples rolling free in the backseat.\n\
  \nDiscussions in non-existent English and Montenegrin were had about heading to\
  \ Kotor. It was slow-going as the driver kept stopping in the middle of the road\
  \ to turn around and talk to us, establishing that we liked Slivovice, the local\
  \ plum brandy. Right on cue, a gleaming bottle of the stuff was retrieved from the\
  \ glovebox and gleefully shared between driver and three passengers. Much stopping\
  \ and drinking in the car ensued and before long we came to a turnoff indicating\
  \ Kotor in one direction and Njegusi the other. The driver took the turn for Njegusi\
  \ and immediately my overactive imagination had me envisioning our grisly ends.\
  \ Pointing in the direction of Kotor, we attempted to find out where we were going,\
  \ only to be reassured with wide toothless grins \"2 mins, only 2 mins then Kotor!\"\
  . Anxiously we sat in the backseat as we drove down winding country lanes. We pulled\
  \ up at a house and were instructed out and inside the house. Sombrely we sat in\
  \ silence, listening to the discussion outside between the driver and his passenger.\
  \ We rued being so utterly trustful of our toothless companions. \n\nThen just like\
  \ that, desperation transformed into joy. Our \u2018kidnappers\u2019 procured a\
  \ litre of slivovice easing our tensions when we realised all they wanted to do\
  \ was have a few drinks with us! Two hours of wild gesticulations and roaring laughter\
  \ followed as both parties tried to learn more of each other. They seemed hell-bent\
  \ on finishing the entire bottle, and the least we could do after having such un-charitable\
  \ thoughts was to go along and help them do it. An instrument called a Gushle was\
  \ pulled from the wall and we attempted to play whilst photographs were taken of\
  \ all of us wearing a military hat from 1910. The making of Turkish coffee signalled\
  \ that it was time to go, and after enjoying one of the best cups of coffee I've\
  \ ever had, we were back in the car again on our way to Kotor. \n\nWe were too overcome\
  \ by our experience of pure Montenegrin hospitality to care too much about our sensible\
  \ notions of drink-driving. Negotiating the descent of 30 hair-pin bends was made\
  \ quite exciting as the driver greeted every turn by taking both hands off the wheel,\
  \ spitting in them and rubbing them together gleefully! The car\u2019s age was the\
  \ saving grace as it could only reach speeds of 40km's per hour. Back in Kotor,\
  \ we tried to buy our new friends a \u2018Thank you\u2019 bottle of Slivovice. Having\
  \ none it, we were given an enthusiastic farewell by two warm and happy smiling\
  \ faces, forever etching this most enriching cultural experience in our hearts."
