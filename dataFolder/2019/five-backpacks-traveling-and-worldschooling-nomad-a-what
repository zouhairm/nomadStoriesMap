Text: "Not all who wander are lost.\nSome are on a quest.\n\nWe are living nomadically,\
  \ traveling around the globe to gather knowledge that will help us lead the rest\
  \ of our lives more thoughtfully and with greater perspective.\n\nWe are on this\
  \ quest in order to spend less time shoveling around our stuff and more time learning\
  \ as a family. We wish to know which of the material possessions that seem to burden\
  \ us are worth their weight. We want to quit worming our way through well-worn paths\
  \ of thought. We wish to experience the growth that comes from intentional culture\
  \ shock. We want to see the world firsthand, rather than through the eyes of the\
  \ evening news.\n\nWe have spent the last fifteen joyful years in Alexandria, Virginia\
  \ \u2014 originally as two, Chris and Holly, eventually as five, with the addition\
  \ of our sons Jack, Leo, and Seth. Alexandria has been a great home, full of family,\
  \ friends, past adventures, formative moments, poignant memories, and more history\
  \ and culture than you can shake a stick at. We have loved our careers as teachers\
  \ of martial arts and music, and are grateful to all the students who have come\
  \ our way. We\u2019re not overjoyed about the weather, but all told, it has been\
  \ a great place to live, grow, and raise a family.\n\nAnd so, logically, we have\
  \ decided to leave for a while \U0001F642\n\nWe embark on April 22, 2019. We will\
  \ first drive across country for about three months, camping in our nation\u2019\
  s amazing wild places, and visiting far-off friends and family. We will then fly\
  \ across the Pacific to learn about China, Russia, and Mongolia. Plans are sketchy\
  \ from there on, with a vague southerly direction as it starts to get cold. We want\
  \ to train in the Philippines, and we hear that New Zealand is amazing. Part of\
  \ the process is to figure things out as we go. Isn\u2019t that the way of life?\n\
  \nWorld-schooling, here we come!"
