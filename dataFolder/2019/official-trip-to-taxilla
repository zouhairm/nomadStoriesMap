Text: "When I was in 8th class, our whole class had an official trip to Taxilla, a\
  \ city located almost 70 km from Islamabad. \nThat was Sunday. All of us were very\
  \ excited for the tour. Some of the students wanted to go to Murree. It was our\
  \ classteacher, sir Ishaq Ali Raza who convinced us to go to Taxilla rather than\
  \ Murree.\nWe had preparations for the trip week before that Sunday. At that specific\
  \ day, all the students prepared themselves and we assembled at 7:30am in front\
  \ of our college hostel. The bus was ready. Sir Ishaq had come. \nWe were seated\
  \ in the bus and it started moving. We reached Taxilla at about 9 am. \nFirst of\
  \ all we went to HITEC university in which heavy industries related education is\
  \ taught. It was a wide university. Many departments were there. A special guide\
  \ from the university showed us the whole university. There were different grounds\
  \ to play cricket, football, volleyball etc. \nThen we went to the old ruined civilization\
  \ of Buddhists. It was well organized civilization. They had water sanitation system,\
  \ different rooms, water pool, washrooms,worship places etc. \nThere was the oldest\
  \ university of Asia named Juvilian. It was a very systematic university of the\
  \ past. Students had hostel with separate rooms for everyone. People from across\
  \ the region used  to study there. Then it was ruined by conquerors.\nKhanpur Dam\
  \ was also worth watchin. We rode on camels. We had lunch there too.\nAfter that\
  \ we went to Faisal Mosque Islamabad where we offered prayers. \nOur official time\
  \ for the trip was about to be over. Our teacher decided to go back to college.\n\
  We were seated again in the bus and reached the college at about 7 pm.\nWe enjoyed\
  \ the trip a lot, learnt a lot and had a lot of fun. \nThat's all about our trip."
