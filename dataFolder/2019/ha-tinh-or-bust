Text: "I woke up early in Vietnam. It\u2019s nothing new; I\u2019ve been doing this\
  \ since 2016. The only new thing was the pain in my neck after resting my head in\
  \ a series of syllabi that were overdue.\n\nInjecting my body with the necessary\
  \ toxins it has grown accustomed to, I worked outside watching the sunrise. It's\
  \ therapeutic starting the day this way, until it\u2019s one those days where the\
  \ royal blue skies of night begin forcing little balls of sweat down your face.\n\
  \nBy dawn it was time to put on a tie for a meeting. I\u2019ve had hundreds of meetings,\
  \ but none where I\u2019ve had to ask for large sums of money on behalf of my employers.\
  \ When I first started this job with a \u2018how hard can it be?\u2019 attitude,\
  \ I never thought I\u2019d be sitting in front of business people asking for funding.\
  \ \n\nTie off; it was time to teach colours. It's a hard change of mindset from\
  \ talking 5 figure sums to pronunciation sounds. One is very diplomatic; the other\
  \  humorous with the possibility that some nose picker will punch you in the privates.\n\
  \nAround midday it was time for the long ride out of town, volunteering a summer\
  \ holiday program in rural Ha Tinh. A tough journey via roads that are harsher than\
  \ a teenagers face; full of snakes, trucks and mountain passes. One wrong move means\
  \ a tricky phone call to the insurers. Particularly when you\u2019re journey includes\
  \ swearing as your front tyre bursts.\n\nBetween classes I have enough time for\
  \ pho \u2013 a rural mess of a beef-noodle broth, drowned in chilli sauce. However,\
  \ my second portion of toxin injection was interrupted by my boss saying we have\
  \ a dinner meeting and that I\u2019ll have to drive because he\u2019s had a few.\n\
  \nI nursed my bike back into town to wrestle with Ha Tinh\u2019s rush hour traffic\
  \ while my boss sleeps. I\u2019ve driven in many countries throughout the world,\
  \ but nothing is more exhilarating than provincial Vietnam at dusk.\n\nThis was\
  \ not knowing what happened that evening. I\u2019d been asked to revise a driving\
  \ syllabus for an American investor who is teaching students to drive. Anything\
  \ to help students in this desperately poor province gets my tick of approval \u2013\
  \ particularly something that involves me having a quick drive.\n\nIt all went well;\
  \ the investor showed me his ideas for driving in the blackness of night, me flicking\
  \ the ass out on gravel corners with the ultimate male entertainment: the handbrake.\
  \ That is until one of the wheels went a bit wobbly, and we spun\u2026 a lot. Long\
  \ of the short of it \u2013 I broke it, having driven a brand new car 4 kilometres.\n\
  \nThankfully, insurance policies allow for teachers to damage property because it\
  \ was time for football. The Vietnamese love their football, even when it\u2019\
  s 2 am and an angry Indonesian commentator has Vietnamese subtitles. Enjoying my\
  \ first beer for the week, I nervously wrote a script for an IELTS video I was making\
  \ the following week; finishing in time to watch Vietnam score the only goal against\
  \ South Korea.\n\nCatching the bus at dawn back to Ha Tinh under the influence of\
  \ tiredness saw a text saying I needed to teach an afternoon class after another\
  \ morning meeting. So tie back on, by 9 am, it was detailed discussion about something\
  \ not interesting. \n\nFear not, by 1:30 it was time for a final toxin injection\
  \ before teaching IELTS listening. If it wasn\u2019t for the occasional swear word,\
  \ I would have been in a coma. Of boredom. \n\nWhen the final bell rang at 5pm signifying\
  \ an even off, it did allow me to reflect on what was achieved in the past 34 sleep-free\
  \ hours:\nFinished syllabi, five-figure meeting, taught, rode, taught more, drove,\
  \ broke a car, wrote a script, meet again and taught once more.\nThere was no point\
  \ in anyone asking me if I was ok, because the simple fact of the matter was - I\
  \ was broken.\n\nBut I would rather do that every day for the rest of my days than\
  \ anything else. This job is cruel, harsh and unforgiving \u2013 but it's the single\
  \ most rewarding thing in the world."
