Text: "Travel is a continuous discovery of people, of new places but above all, of\
  \ yourself. Moments that are breathtaking, smiles that grab you. Just like India,\
  \ a world apart, suspended between past and future, did with me. Nature, people\
  \ and their vibrations awaken a myriad of feelings and contrasting emotions, like\
  \ when I see their millenary traditions and vision towards progress coexisting with\
  \ very harsh living conditions and the damage of the planet, that some of these\
  \ traditions have.\nIt\u2019s weird to walk through the streets of the south of\
  \ India and not see other westerners. Anyways, everyone looks and stares at you\
  \ constantly as if I was the only one that comes from faraway lands, and my mind\
  \ takes me back to all anxious and fearful phrases told countless times by my friends\
  \ and relatives, before leaving Italy.\nSmell, noises and tastes are so different\
  \ from every other I felt before. Of death is the first smell I feel in this strange\
  \ land.\nIndia is a place with a unique and timeless charm, able to make me start\
  \ looking at this world again with wonder, without prejudices or barriers, from\
  \ a different perspective. It makes me explore in the unknown in a new way, or perhaps\
  \ in a way I left in my childhood..\n\_\nNow, more than ever, I realize that some\
  \ days are perfect in solitary: me, my curiosity and the world around me.\nIt\u2019\
  s morning and I decide to go towards the road that runs along the Varkala's cliff,\
  \ today there is a particular energy, everything appears so profound. Along the\
  \ way, I meet children who eat banana chips and others who invite me to play the\
  \ carrom, a typical Indian game. The unexpected opening of these people never ends\
  \ to amaze me.\nAfter an hour I continue with the walk, and I arrive to the Black\
  \ beach, so colorful because\_of the residues of volcanic minerals. I stop for a\
  \ few minutes to enjoy of the sound of ocean waves and set off for Kappil beach,\
  \ the point where the largest lake in Kerala meets the ocean. On my left I see the\
  \ sea and on my right there are endless expanses of palms and coconut trees that\
  \ fall from time to time, sometimes a resort that clashes with rudimentary stone\
  \ houses or with leaf roofs of palm trees. Suddenly, the magic silence is interrupted\
  \ by a voice, two little girls, twins. They look at me from a little house and run\
  \ towards me with curiosity, asking me to come in. \nThe emotion for this invitation\
  \ is high, I tiptoe towards the entrance and the grandmother appears at the door,\
  \ inviting me to come in and sit down without hesitating. It\u2019s pure magic.\
  \ We introduce ourselves, the mother of the three girls arrives and after several\
  \ questions, sometimes also uncomfortable, they bring out dozens of notebooks with\
  \ drawings, and page after page, I feel more and more at home and welcomed. They\
  \ explain me every single lines and in a heartbeat it\u2019s been an hour between\
  \ those four walls and that breathtaking view when I was overlooking the ocean.\
  \ A simple life, made of the essentials, or maybe even less. Two rooms for almost\
  \ ten people, mattresses on the floor, a super small entrance hall with few chairs\
  \ and a door wide open to life.\nIt\u2019s time to continue, but first, they ask\
  \ me to leave my autograph, so they take out a small notebook where I can enter\
  \ different data: name, country of origin, birthday, mother, father, sister, best\
  \ friend and they ask me to leave my signature. With a filled heart and bright eyes\
  \ I thank everyone and I head back to Kappil beach, after several kilometres I\u2019\
  m there, ocean and lake just skim each other, it's not the right season to see them\
  \ meet, but the atmosphere is incredible.\nAn intense day, full of meetings, emotions,\
  \ exchanges, this is the meaning of the journey.\nThe people I meet, the travelers\
  \ I cross in the way, the local inhabitants who kidnap me and tell me their stories,\
  \ their questions, but above all, their sincere smiles. They are the great discovery\
  \ of my journey."
