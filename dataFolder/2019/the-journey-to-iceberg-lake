Text: "It was 6am when my alarm sprang to life, I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and\
  \ with an outstretched hand reverted our van back to silence. \nAs I began the process\
  \ of cooking bacon and eggs with our back doors open, Grace, my girlfriend, was\
  \ awoken by the aroma of bacon and the noise of oil and fat splashing and spitting\
  \ from the pan.\n\nThe kettle was boiled, coffee made, breakfast eaten and soon\
  \ that familiar feeling of placing one's foot in a hiking boot took over, as we\
  \ stretched out our legs and attempted to breathe life in to our weary muscles.\n\
  \nToday was different though, it was Grace\u2019s birthday. And to celebrate we\
  \ decided to hike to a spot known as \u201Ciceberg lake\u201D to celebrate the aging\
  \ of our bodies. \n\nSoon the rucksack was slung over the shoulder and buckled into\
  \ its familiar resting place as we locked our van and slowly started plodding towards\
  \ our destination.\n\nThe first hour of hiking was pleasant, our rested bodies made\
  \ easy work of the ascent as we walked stoically through a forest thick with pine\
  \ trees and hyperactive squirrels. The only noise being made was the crackling of\
  \ twigs underfoot and the constant ringing of our bear bell attached to our rucksack.\n\
  \nWe were hiking in British Columbia, an area famed for its rugged beauty and pristine\
  \ wildlife. So to avoid any confrontation with the biggest predator out here, the\
  \ bell was attached securely to the rucksack in attempt for us to not stumble upon\
  \ and frighten a large bear.\nThe plan appeared to be working as we marched forward,\
  \ no bear encounters yet, but squirrels and chipmunks ran around freely, seemingly\
  \ undeterred by the ringing.\n\nThe pines began to thin as we continued to climb,\
  \ the gurgling of water could soon be heard as we found the outflow of the lake\
  \ we had been seeking, we knew we were closing in and soon came upon an alpine meadow.\
  \ \n\nHere the pines had ceased growing and grassland took over, we climbed a rocky\
  \ outcrop to survey the meadow in front of us, a path meandered on the outskirts\
  \ towards our alpine lake which sat perched several hundred yards above the clearing,\
  \ a group of four people walked slowly down towards us. We chose here to have a\
  \ snack and rest our legs before we continued on the final portion of the hike,\
  \ when suddenly the entire group in front of us froze.\n\nA sense of danger gripped\
  \ the meadow, no noise was being emitted and it seemed as though everyone had stopped\
  \ breathing, and it was at the time I realized why. \n\nA female grizzly bear slowly\
  \ rose from its resting spot, a gigantic animal, with a skull the size of a beach\
  \ ball and paws that can rip a car door clean off its hinges. It\u2019s two, small,\
  \ energetic cubs tussled with each other and all of this a mere 50 yards from the\
  \ group.\n\nThe mother bear originally took no heed of the intruders, as two of\
  \ the members slowly grabbed their bear spray precautionary. But then, one of the\
  \ bears inquisitive cubs caught a scent, and slowly began walking towards the statuesque\
  \ group. \n\nIn a split second, one of the group began to holler and shout in an\
  \ attempt to scare off the bears, the rest of them joined in on the scare tactic,\
  \ but this only frightened the mother grizzly in to thinking that her cub was in\
  \ danger as she started to charge towards the wall of noise.\n\nThe two spray wielding\
  \ members unleashed the toxins from their canisters as the grizzly roared in defiance,\
  \ and with just a gap of 5 yards, the spray deterred the bear enough for it to spin\
  \ around in anger, and run into the pine laden forest with its cubs in tow. \n\n\
  We waited for four hours before walking back through the forest towards our van,\
  \ every sense was on edge, the bear spray gripped tightly and adrenaline coursed\
  \ through our veins as we walked in hope of avoiding another confrontation"
