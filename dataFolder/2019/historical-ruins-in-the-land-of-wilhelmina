Text: "The Netherlands, historically and culture indirectly has an attachment to Indonesia.\
  \ directly or indirectly, if reviewed historically many things that have been achieved\
  \ by the Dutch are currently the result of Indonesian nation's culture. Many Indonesian\
  \ historical heritages are stored in Dutch museums that cannot yet be studied, maximally\
  \ examined in the form of manuscripts, historical records and other historical objects.\
  \ It is the duty of the Dutch government and the Indonesian government to be able\
  \ to sit together to solve this problem because this is a world cultural heritage\
  \ that must be saved and studied by the world community. Many historical objects\
  \ from the Indonesian nation are stored in museums scattered in various parts of\
  \ the Netherlands which have not been optimally studied comprehensively. \nFrom\
  \ some of the notes that I traced, these historic objects can be grouped in several\
  \ periods or times. There are cultural objects before the arrival of the Dutch government\
  \ trade mission in order to expand in order to become competitors from the Spanish\
  \ kingdom and the Portuguese empire; an era where after the domination of the Netherlands\
  \ in Indonesia, it was marked by the establishment of the VOC (Vereenigde Oostindische\
  \ Compagnie)  trading commission; and times after the collapse of the VOC (Vereenigde\
  \ Oostindische Compagnie) ; also the emergence of politics reciprocated. Catatan\
  \ - catatan ini menjadi penting bila kita telusuri secara budaya, histori guna menatap\
  \ hubungan baik dari kedua negara. Kami berharap dengan adanya study tentang benda-\
  \ benda sejarah bangsa Indonesia yang tersimpan di Belanda dapat membuka wawasan\
  \ ilmu pengetahuan khususnya bagi masyarakat Indonesia. It is our great hope that\
  \ the Dutch kingdom is willing to facilitate this journey for the good relations\
  \ of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands\
  \ and for the advancement of science."
