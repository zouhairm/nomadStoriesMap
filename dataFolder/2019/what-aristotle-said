Text: "Across the harbour from the mosque I looked towards the old Jewish quarter.\
  \ There wasn`t time to get lost again in those streets and alleys so I made for\
  \ the bus. The bouzouki and chorus of \u201COlos o kosmos Thalassa\u2026\u201D sounded\
  \ from the radio and I crossed myself in the Greek Orthodox manner as we passed\
  \ the church. Perhaps that`s why the elderly gentleman next to me patted my arm\
  \ and pointed to my lap, \u201CPosoi seagull[oi] einai levkoi?\u201D he said. I\
  \ had Alan Turing`s 1950 paper on Computing machinery. I felt that strong feeling\
  \ of coincidence as if something just touched me. He was referring to swans, it\
  \ was this idea about how Science is done, what Alan refers to, and appears to mock,\
  \ as Scientific induction: it`s essentially the way man sees more and more similar\
  \ things, e.g. an object or phenomenon (man always seems obsessed with having to\
  \ see things) and so draws the conclusion; all of those things are like that, even\
  \ though most often a very large part has not been investigated. And the short of\
  \ it as we all know sometimes one of those things appears that is completely different,\
  \ or a lot of them in the case of the seagulls.\nCrete`s old capital Xania, sometime\
  \ Ottoman, charmingly Venetian and in Minoan times known as Kydonia, was out of\
  \ view now but I could see the deep blue Aegean alive with lots of little white\
  \ horses. These seas can get rough when the meltemi picks up and I wondered what\
  \ conditions were like when the Antikythera mechanism found its way to the seabed.\
  \ Now sitting in the museum in Athens \u2013 purportedly an astronomical computing\
  \ device. Whatever it does it never ceases to fascinate me: Science and ancient\
  \ Greece. You see, I was trying to be a Scientist and this idea that perhaps I wasn`t\
  \ doing it properly was on my mind. Aristotle said something like, \u201Cto say\
  \ that that which is is not OR that which is not is - is a falsehood, and to say\
  \ that that which is is AND that which is not is not - is true\u201D. Remember this\
  \ was around 330 BC. So even if my Greek was better I knew people now only really\
  \ had the chance to see this as I had. Because I felt this is Science, both on the\
  \ level of how to reason something, ok without \u201Cappears to be\u201D but the\
  \ falsehood part can allow for that, and if you assume a closed system and can examine\
  \ it fully, regardless of whether we are told he wrote this in his Metaphysics,\
  \ can this not describe reality?\nRain patted the windows as we passed through clouds\
  \ on the Lefka Ori. These mountains reach near 2500m, with caves a kilometer deep\
  \ and in their midst like a great scar, the Samaria gorge. This terrain and people\
  \ have sheltered nonconformists for centuries. Things were moving quickly as we\
  \ reached the plateau; shepherds, their sheep and goats, farmhouses and olive groves,\
  \ and sun bursting through on to green pastures. Then nothing but blue and with\
  \ a glimmer from the Libyan Sea I thought I could trace an island as we descended\
  \ south. At Sougia everything is seafront, in this delightful village. I felt cool\
  \ as I sat there in the shade of the taverna, light reflecting from the mirror still\
  \ sea as I thought of her. The waitress placed the coffee down \u201Cellinikos kafes\u201D\
  , and added with a smile \u201Cbe careful, it`ll burn your soul\u201D.\nThe next\
  \ day I set off early, catching the morning ferry east. It was humbling to see Agia\
  \ Roumeli lying below this tall and wide fissure of the Gorge. I was hiking to Loutro,\
  \ the little white washed village at Phoenix, treading along stones and stopping\
  \ for the occasional dip. The sun high, my thoughts flicked between Scientific induction\
  \ and what Aristotle said. What about infinity or another dimension? What if a closed\
  \ system could open for the briefest instance. I was beginning to stumble as I climbed\
  \ the track, reaching out for the nearest branches. Then I saw her. Through the\
  \ pines by the water`s edge, the church of Agios Pavlos and beyond, Gavdos."
