Text: "9:00 A.M.\nShip leaving in 5 hours.\nDocuments? Shoes? Camera? All checked.\
  \ Everything's here.\nI always love and hate that excitement's nausea that captures\
  \ my body everytime I have to travel. A part of me wants to stay and a part of me\
  \ can't wait to go.\nThis time my parents organized the trip without telling me\
  \ the exact cities we were about to go to. \"Greece\" was the only detail I got.\n\
  I searched some stuff online, learned a few words like \"thank you\" or \"goodbye\"\
  \ and got annoyed by all those comments about \"the best sunset ever in Santorini\"\
  .\nWell.. Guess what? It was REALLY the BEST sunset ever!\nI didn't expect to find\
  \ those vivid colors, to see the orange sun reflected on the amazingly blue sea,\
  \ making wonderful pink fades in the sky. The gentle wind and all the smells that\
  \ carried, the music, the lanscapes, the people.. Oh, the people! For weeks before\
  \ our holiday I've been reading wrong assumption about greek people: they said they\
  \ were rude and unpolite. Instead, I met kind people, generous souls and funny old\
  \ men who told me ancient stories about the islands and invited me to dance. Greek\
  \ food wowed me as well. I tried strange recipies which even if on the menu pictures\
  \ looked a little weird, they were heaven in a plate!\nI didn't expect to find such\
  \ a beautiful country, I was scared maybe by all the negative things I heard before\
  \ leaving, or maybe by the stereothypes that circulate around those places. Whatever\
  \ it was, I was happy to learn just amazing thing about Greece. I couldn't stop\
  \ talking to people, taking pictures, getting hypnotized by the view or breathing\
  \ the pleasantly salty air.\nAfter Santorini we visited Athens and trust me when\
  \ I say there's no other feeling like reaching the top of the Acropolis and finding\
  \ yourself face to face with the Parthenon. And what about when while you're up\
  \ there, you turn around and find out that you have - literally - Athens at your\
  \ feet? WOW!\nIt was hard but totally worth it.\nOf course we couldn't come back\
  \ without admiring Mykonos' mills or without swimming in Katakolon's glowing sea\
  \ (like.. really, do they photoshop everything or what?!). I really loved those\
  \ places and I may even consider to move there someday.\nThis trip was definitely\
  \ one of the best of my life and I can't wait to go back there and see that mesmerizing\
  \ sunset that, for now, is just a wonderful memory in my heart.\nThanks Greece,\
  \ I really didn't expect you to enchant me, but I'm so happy you did it.\n\nP.S.\
  \ *for coffee lovers* In Greece you will find out that whatever is your team, Americano\
  \ or Espresso, here you will for sure get addicted to \u03BA\u03B1\u03C6\u03AD.\n\
  Have you ever heard an italian girl loving a foreign coffee like her own? No?! Then\
  \ that's why you should go to Greece!"
