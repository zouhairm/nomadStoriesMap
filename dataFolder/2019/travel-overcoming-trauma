Text: "Several years ago, I learned that I had PTSD. I was easy to startle, and avoided\
  \ social media because triggers would cause me to cry, drink, or go on long, solo\
  \ walks. \n\nI had a remote job, and so it was easy to stay inside (where I felt\
  \ safe), order food, and work without even getting dressed.\n\nMy anxiety only became\
  \ worse, to the point that I was too terrified to tell Seamless which apartment\
  \ I lived in. I would have the food delivered to the front door and come down to\
  \ retrieve my meals. The sound of the doorbell startled me.\n\nI saw coworkers of\
  \ mine who lived hermit-like lives in front of their computers. They didn't leave\
  \ their apartments. I knew that was going to be my future. . . and I needed a change.\n\
  \nAfter all, I had a remote job. Why shouldn't I travel?\n\nBetween 2017 and now,\
  \ I traveled to 10 countries: Italy, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Germany, Austria, England,\
  \ Turkey, India, Colombia, and England. I learned Odissi dance from an Indian guru\
  \ in a temple, belly danced on the waters between Asia and Europe in Istanbul, taught\
  \ yoga and learned energy healing in Costa Rica, and volunteered helping kids in\
  \ a Nicaraguan barrio with their homework.\n\nWhile I still have PTSD, the condition\
  \ no longer controls my life. The anxiety and flashbacks do not dictate my days.\
  \ Recently, I quit my remote job to focus on writing full time. In just a few months,\
  \ I have become a top writer in the travel, feminism, race, humor, fiction, and\
  \ creative writing categories on Medium: \n\nhttps://medium.com/@lisamartens\n\n\
  Medium and teaching yoga and belly dance have become my primary sources of income,\
  \ and I have the passion to continue traveling and writing. \n\nJust as I left my\
  \ comfy, dark apartment to explore and take advantage of a nomadic opportunity,\
  \ I have now left the comfort of a corporate job to turn my passions and hobbies\
  \ into so much more: I aim to inspire others, to make them laugh, and to show those\
  \ who may be frightened that the world and its inhabitants are not so scary, so\
  \ threatening, or so dangerous...that we live in a beautiful world and should explore\
  \ both the beauty around us and the beauty inside ourselves."
