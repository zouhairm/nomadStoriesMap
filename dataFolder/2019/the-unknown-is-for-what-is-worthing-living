Text: "Exactly two years ago I decided to go in an exchange to Romania. At the time\
  \ I was feeling bad about lots of things in my life and thought that travelling\
  \ abroad, alone, to the other side of the world was going to be a turning point\
  \ for me. Discover something different, more about myself, get to know people from\
  \ around the world was the good things. But I was in a country I knew nothing about\
  \ it. Was to do something that I was terrible at: to give classes to children and\
  \ teenagers. I didn't knew absolute nobody there or travelling to. So I stopped\
  \ to think to feel less anxious. At the moment I entered in the airport in Brasilia,\
  \ Brazil, I stopped to think. But I couldn't do that, were to many expectations,\
  \ too many concerns. I started to feel seek, to pass out, to throw up. In The hole\
  \ travel. All the 4 hours to Panama. All the 9 hours to Italy. All the 3 hours to\
  \ Romania. \nI thought I couldn't do it. I thought I will need to go back home.\
  \ I thought I was going to arrive in the \"slum of Europe\" as people told me and\
  \ was going to be alone.\nAt the moment I arrived at my dorm I meet my roommates.\
  \ Was a dorm of a school and two floors were for us. People from China, Taiwan,\
  \ Egypt, Oman, Pakistan and Brazil were there already.\nThey were all playing games\
  \ together, waiting for me to arrive and go eat in the City. I arrived and they\
  \ were smiling, introducing them, telling about the dorm and how cold was the City.\
  \ It was freezing.\nAfter I tell about me, holding the anxious to trow up again.\
  \ They told me that in the weekend we had no job, so they were planning to go to\
  \ a City close to there first thing in the morning. I just didn't thought about\
  \ it and said I was also going. The happiness to be there, to just do stuff, to\
  \ just trust those people and feel like home took place in me.\nSo we went out to\
  \ have dinner, and besides being seek I felt alive, like never before, like a few\
  \ times after. I felt the City, the little places, the lights in the streets. There\
  \ was nobody in the streets, we are just talking and feeling the cold toking place\
  \ in us. I saw the snow for the first time, and was better and beautiful that I\
  \ could ever imagine. I felt my feet frozing and couldn't feel my fingers. This\
  \ moment is so marked in me, the fear of the cold, the unknown. Its strange, but\
  \ I miss this specific moment. The moment I felt most cold in my hole life. Was\
  \ the moment I knew I was doing something for the first time. Was the best feeling\
  \ ever. Where I didn't know what was going to happen after. Where I didn't care\
  \ about before. Where I was feeling all my body. Where I was with me, feeling me.\
  \ I didn't knew what I was going to find there, but at this moment, in this walk\
  \ I knew that this feeling, is what is worth Living. From that moment on I knew\
  \ that this is what I should look for. Not to know stuff, to have plans, expectations,\
  \ Dreams. But to Live the moment I was in. And so I did, in those two months there.\
  \ To really leap into everything, to try, to make mistakes, to meet people, to teach,\
  \ to discover. I stooped to over thinking, and started to enjoy, the good and the\
  \ bad.  \nAnd so I look doing after that, in all my moments. To Live looking for\
  \ feelings for the first time. To Live for the moment.\nAn experience in travelling\
  \ can change your life, not just because of some moment, but to change the way you\
  \ see and deal with everything. \nThank you Romania, to teach me a little more about\
  \ this big world and this crazy life."
