Text: "Growing up may be challenging, but there is always this time of year, when\
  \ you start to believe in miracles again. Whenever you get the feeling of being\
  \ too much of an adult, plan a Christmas trip to Europe (just make your struggles\
  \ appear a little closer to December). The choice of locations is incredible, but\
  \ let me focus on the less expected destinations for a Christmas road trip. \nSo,\
  \ ready? Steady. Valkenburg, the Netherlands. From then on the smell of pine and\
  \ the taste of hot wine became a part of my everyday routine. Walking through illuminated\
  \ streets I chose the route to the caves. Have you ever walked under the rocks cruising\
  \ through various Christmas market tents? Time to put it on your to-do list. And\
  \ prepare your wallets - unexpected spendings may become a \u201Cmust\u201D here.\n\
  Straight after the first breath of Christmas I headed towards Maastricht, the Netherlands.\
  \ A little rushing around tiny streets and I started wondering, where is all the\
  \ magic? A few steps further. And there it was. A huge square with a Ferris wheel,\
  \ ice rink and dozens of tents with souvenirs, food and drinks. A tiny city like\
  \ this can fill with positive vibes so much! \nWe\u2019re just getting warmed up\
  \ here, follow me to Ghent, Belgium. A well-preserved medieval city with a formidable\
  \ castle in the center of it and much more squares for a pleasant Christmas pastime.\
  \ 40+ cuisine choices, husky stroking and surprisingly unique and appealing city\
  \ illumination. While walking from one market location to another, don\u2019t miss\
  \ the \u201CBooks and Booze\u201D shop. Not only will you get acquainted with various\
  \ bottled drinks, but also a sommelier will select the best book that goes with\
  \ it. Don\u2019t drink and drive, drink and read. \nLet\u2019s move further. Time\
  \ for Bruges, Belgium. One of the cities, which got its reputation due to a movie\
  \ and I understand why. It is a fairytale within a fairytale in December - buildings\
  \ make an impression of big gingerbread houses with nice lights and holiday figures.\
  \ Christmas days can become very busy here, but it\u2019s good to be in the country\
  \ of 3000+ beer options - it\u2019s easier to cope with all the inconvenience while\
  \ having a nice Trappist drink. And evenings can be very meditative in comparison\
  \ to days. Just imagine sitting on a terrace in a warm blanket having a nice beverage\
  \ and listening to approaching hooves. \nPack your things again, Antwerp is waiting.\
  \ If you\u2019re traveling by train, you\u2019re a lucky person! Your first impression\
  \ of the city will reach top level on your scale immediately. The train station\
  \ is their calling card and for good reason. Beautiful architecture with several\
  \ floors of train rails seem impossible, but it is real. Head towards the main Christmas\
  \ squares and don\u2019t miss a sculpture of a sleeping boy, who\u2019s hugging\
  \ a dog under a tile blanket. It might be the cutest monument you\u2019ll ever see.\
  \ If you\u2019re tired of hot wine, let me introduce you to Elfde Gebod bar. Don\u2019\
  t confuse it with a church, because I understand how such a number of religious\
  \ figurines might puzzle you. It is meant to be this way and it\u2019s very atmospheric.\
  \ And I wonder, how come this place can have \u201CLucifer\u201D beer on their menu?\
  \ No one knows, but it tastes good, so who cares. \nA final destination, a great\
  \ location for a New Year night. Amsterdam - the city of canals, lights, art exhibitions\
  \ and endless fun. A few hours before midnight find yourself on any central square.\
  \ Fireworks are only allowed here on 31st of December, so can you imagine, how colorful\
  \ the sky is for several hours in a row? I doubt it. You\u2019d better check it\
  \ out for yourself.\nBeing an adult is fun, but staying a kid inside is much more\
  \ fun. Especially when your inner child can be so easily inspired with the help\
  \ of Christmas spirit."
