Text: "I guess my whole life has been influenced by all the trips I made. Starting\
  \ to when I was a kid, traveling with my family, until now that I got to choose\
  \ where I go and with whom. One of those trips that most influenced me happened\
  \ in 2013 when I got the chance to work for the Walt Disney World company, for three\
  \ months. And in the meanwhile, I met my boyfriend - which we only start dating\
  \ a year after our job program had ended.\n \nBut this is not the travel story I\
  \ want to share, even though knowing the background is important for the context.\
  \ In 2015, as a Christmas gift, my boyfriend gave me a bracelet charm with the two\
  \ Californian symbols: the bear and the map of the state. But not only that, with\
  \ the present he made a promise and said: \"This is not only a bracelet charm but\
  \ also a promise that I'll take you to California into an unforgettable road trip\
  \ through the golden coast\". I was very touched by it, but I knew that promise\
  \ would take long enough to happen - if it really was going to happen someday.\n\
  \ \nWe just didn't know that he would go back to work at Disney and spend one year\
  \ abroad, with more than 5.000 kilometers away from me. We spent more than eight\
  \ months without seeing each other in person, talking, arguing and missing each\
  \ other through cell phones and computers. I can't say the long-distance relationships\
  \ are easy, you must love and have so much patience, but they are worthy if love\
  \ someone and wants to see his success.\n \nSo, through the year that we were apart,\
  \ we started to plan a way to see each other, so I found an incredibly cheap flight\
  \ ticket ~ guess where to ~ to California, and then we started to plan our road\
  \ trip. After months of planning, imagining and a couple of bills to pay, we finally\
  \ got back together again, but now in California, where that promise we made a long\
  \ time before, had finally come true.\n \nWe've been from San Francisco to San Diego,\
  \ getting to know every and each small city along the way. Tasting every flavor,\
  \ watching every sunset, getting from 8 to 30 degrees Celsius, always remember to\
  \ have faith in the future, despite the uncertainties and the unknown. But I only\
  \ realize that I was living the promise when I got to see the statue of the bear,\
  \ from the California State flag, right in front of me, at the Griffith Park, in\
  \ Los Angeles. That time I knew the travel of my dreams came true, along with a\
  \ promise made with a bracelet charm and now accomplished."
