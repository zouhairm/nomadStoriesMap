Text: "There was absolutely no good reason for me to want to travel. I come from a\
  \ big hispanic family that's lived in the same 500,000 person city for literally\
  \ generations. No one in my family had ever left the country till last year. Besides\
  \ me. Because 10 years ago at thirteen years old, I marched my impertinent self\
  \ up to my parents and informed them that I was going on a mission trip to Bolivia.\
  \ Oh, and they weren't invited.\nI still remember the moment that first plane took\
  \ off, with me on board. Clutching my passport like it was a lifeline, panic rising.\
  \ Who did I think I was? Who were these people sitting next to me? And more importantly,\
  \ how do I get off this plane?? I was setting off on my first adventure, with no\
  \ idea what I was doing. Since then, I've found that the best adventures start that\
  \ way, and this one falls solidly into that category.\n I don't know if you remember\
  \ being thirteen, but the narrative for most people at that age is basically homework,\
  \ friends, parents, sleep, repeat. Certainly I fit that description. It was a small\
  \ world I inhabited. But Bolivia was different. Riding through the streets of Sucre\
  \ in a rented bus, for the first time I looked beyond my own life. I opened my eyes\
  \ to the world beyond the window, and what I saw I didn't recognize.\nWe spent 8\
  \ days in the city of Sucre.  While there, we did home visits, church visits, school\
  \ visits. We dug the foundations for a new school building, and played soccer in\
  \ the streets with the neighborhood kids. Basically, we got a taste of local life.\
  \ This sound really exotic, but in reality it was more disenchanting. It was keeping\
  \ a smile plastered on your face to hide your shock as you look at a dirty mattress\
  \ on the floor shared by 9 people. It was gratefully accepting a plate of warm food\
  \ from a family, knowing it might have been all they had to eat for dinner. It was\
  \ hearing over and over again the haunting mantra of the poverty-stricken across\
  \ the city, \"Don't forget about us when you go home\". I can still hear it echo\
  \ in my ears. And these experiences, they changed me. My eyes, once completely engorged\
  \ with my own problems, shifted off of myself for the first time. That trip, I realized\
  \ that not all kids get a birthday party every year, or get the chance to go to\
  \ school and take exams. That what I take for granted, or even resented, is of inestimable\
  \ value to millions of kids who would give almost anything to grow up in upper middle\
  \ class suburbia.\nThat, I believe, is the true power of travel. Wherever in the\
  \ world we go, there are people there with existences completely separate from our\
  \ own. In encountering them, in being accepted into their lives and opening our\
  \ hearts to them in return, we see worlds we couldn't have dreamed existed. Our\
  \ eyes shift. And this is powerful. We hear their mantra, \"Don't forget me\", and\
  \ we carry a part of them with us.\nSince that first international experience, my\
  \ travels have taken me far and wide. I have the pieces of many lives woven into\
  \ the fabric of my own. Every member of my immediate family now has their passport.\
  \ My parents took Europe by storm last year, my brother spent 3 weeks in Ecuador.\
  \ I dream of influencing cultures around the world to make international travel\
  \ a staple of their society. What's my good reason to travel nowadays? I believe\
  \ that when we see worlds that are not our own, the world becomes much more our\
  \ own for it."
