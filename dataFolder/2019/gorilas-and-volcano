Text: "I was with my partner in the southern part of Mexico, we were getting close\
  \ to celebrate our 5th anniversary. So I went to a travel agency and check flights\
  \ from Mexico to Guatemala. Didn't know much about the country. These happened on\
  \ 1995. No internet and not a lot of resources. I called him into a nice spot in\
  \ San Cristobal de las Casas town, told him that I had a surprise for him and I\
  \ was going to take him in an adventure. Little that I know that I was going to\
  \ do that. We arrived in Guatemala City, soon after we arrived in Antigua. Went\
  \ to the Tourist information office. I wanted to check what was around with in the\
  \ city and the area. I always like to know what is safe or unsafe, specially in\
  \ a city that I have never been before and didn't know much. I was told that for\
  \ the most part the city was safe. But, NOT TO GO TO A VOLCANO close by the city.\
  \ Since it has been some problems with the rebels called Gorilas. So, I took the\
  \ information and a few blocks from there I saw that they were selling some tours.\
  \ Among those tours, they were offering the tour to the Volcano in which I was told\
  \ not to go. I asked the person, and he assure me that it was safe. We discussed\
  \ it and decided to go on that adventure the following day. It was a few hours hike,\
  \ we have to stop for a bit of rest mid ways to the volcano crater. Met other Canadians,\
  \ which they informed me that they heard that a few months back the Gorilas attacked\
  \ the tourist people. They killed the men and raped the women. I turn to look at\
  \ my partner and asked me to figure out what to do. They were to choices, either\
  \ go up and take a chance that nothing happen or go down and perhaps get lost in\
  \ the middle of the forest, since it was not a road to follow. We discussed it for\
  \ a while and we both decided to continued with the trip. It was an amazing experience.\
  \ On the way down, start getting darker and it was a bit scary knowing that in any\
  \ given moment we could get attack by the Gorilas. On the other hand, the adrenaline\
  \ rush it was incredible. Not sure if I would do something like that again. On the\
  \ way down, I realized that the tour guy lied to me when I asked the day before\
  \ if it was safe to go up in the volcano. We had two tour guides, one will go ahead\
  \ of us and we have to follow him. The other will go behind us, to make sure that\
  \ everyone was going down with the group, and to make sure that no one was missing.\
  \ Everyone has a flashlight, since it was really dark and it was in the middle of\
  \ the jungle. I was close to the back of the line, I realized that the tour guide\
  \ that was close to me was carry a gun. That is when I realized how dangerous was\
  \ what we were doing. \nThe adventure continued when we decided to go to Tikal.\
  \ We flew in one of the local airlines from Antigua. It was a 20 seats plane. It\
  \ was really scary, to see at the small airport. Burned planes, or pieces of planes\
  \ left behind at the airport. It was a really smooth flight to Flores. Which was\
  \ the town closest to Tikal, then we took a transfer. In the minivan I met a guy\
  \ from Italy, he was asking me if we were Americans. My response, was NO we are\
  \ Canadian. His reply was \"I am so glad to hear that.\" I thought, there we go\
  \ again - he start telling me that sometimes in this roads between Flores and Tikal,\
  \ the Gorilas will stop the minivan and will ask for ID. If they found any Americans,\
  \ will rob them and leave the rest of the passengers alone......the adventure continues\
  \ in Guatemala! Hope to be able to write another adventure."
