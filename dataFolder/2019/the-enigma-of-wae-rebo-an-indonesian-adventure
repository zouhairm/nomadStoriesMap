Text: "I\u2019m on the island of Flores in East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, heading\
  \ east from the scrappy port of Labuan Bajo, traveling through Manggarai country\
  \ by car towards a secluded village in the hills called Wae Rebo. The Manggarai\
  \ are indigenous people \u2013 mostly Catholic after the Portuguese dominated the\
  \ island in the 1500s, but they still retain animist beliefs and hold on to traditional\
  \ rituals. Wae Rebo dates back 1200 years.\n\nA few minutes out of town and there\
  \ are rolling green paddy fields; bubble bath clouds pour rain on distant hills;\
  \ sprays of morning light shower swaying banana fronds, coconut palms, rustling\
  \ bamboo, and grizzly green creepers. The light is beautiful and the wind comes\
  \ tumbling down, like a soft heavy towel to wrap us in it\u2019s luxurious embrace.\
  \ On the radio, a local called Ivan Nestorman, sings of dancing dragons and the\
  \ cape of flowers. \n\nThe sky is powder blue over the sea behind us, and woolly\
  \ grey ahead. The road, like some windblown ribbon, wraps upwards through the hills,\
  \ past tin-roof shacks made of wood, palm-mats, bamboo, bricks, ply, cinder-blocks,\
  \ anything! Along the way, there are shops with yellow banana bunting selling gasoline,\
  \ water and biskut kelapa. \n\nTwo hours later, beneath the brows of towering clouds\
  \ and through valleys daubed with sunshine, are terraced rice fields, stony streams\
  \ by immaculate churches and graves tiled with Lady Madonna. Soccer games roll by,\
  \ tiny vagabond schoolchildren skip and cows graze in slow-motion; palms drip rosary\
  \ beads of fruit; clove trees, silver-blonde candlenut, cocoa and coffee all seem\
  \ to grow wild here. There\u2019s a never-ending breeze swirling through these hills\
  \ and a drizzle at polite intervals.\n\nAt one point, we stop. The road ahead has\
  \ been washed away by heavy rain the previous day. The driver turns the car around\
  \ \u2013 perhaps no Wae Rebo today. My hopes dip. We pass smiling locals and turn\
  \ again \u2013 there is another road \u2013 bumpy and broken, through a back way.\
  \ An hour later - same story, different broken road \u2013 even daring motorcycle-taxi\
  \ ojeks refuse to go onwards. In the distance, the Savu Sea crashes onto a rocky\
  \ coastline and trees stand ankle-deep in what must have been a buffering beach.\
  \ And then, like some thunderous angel, a public transport truck arrives. Salvation\
  \ is a lorry ride \u2013 boombox at full choir, blaring crude rap, belching diesel\
  \ fumes, wooden plank benches rattling and bopping over stones and broken road.\
  \ The sea is lapping mere feet away. I board, grin and hang on. \n\nWe pass over\
  \ the elemental road and up another hill. Irrigation channels flow downward past\
  \ fields on either side toward the sea. Up ahead is the village of Denge \u2013\
  \ provider of overpriced starchy rice and instant-noodles, gateway to the forested\
  \ mountain and the trail-head that leads up to Wae Rebo. \n\nSwitching to motorbikes,\
  \ my novice guide and I ascend for 10 minutes, dismounting at a forded stream, and\
  \ begin a climb through a dripping rainforest on a crude path of wet-melt orange\
  \ soil studded with broken rocks. It\u2019s 3 PM, but it feels like 5. The trail\
  \ is 5 kilometers long, but at a 30-degree angle, it feels like forever. The path\
  \ mists, Jurassic-era ferns drip, and all I can hear is my heartbeat, heavy breathing\
  \ and the occasional call of some exotic, hidden bird. We pass clouds at eye-level,\
  \ look down at a lush green carpet of trees and up at the never-ending gloom and\
  \ the unknown road ahead. \n\nAt 5 PM, not too soon, but much before the expected\
  \ 4 hours, the road forks \u2013 one path continues, and another goes up to an outlook.\
  \ I step up to the viewpoint. In the distance, in a clearing on a ledge, stands\
  \ Wae Rebo \u2013 seven large conical huts, blackened by moisture on a green field,\
  \ in the middle of a mist, overlooking a valley and sheltered by towering hills\
  \ \u2013 it\u2019s an enigma, both there and not quite there, and a beautiful sight\
  \ after an arduous journey. Ricky, my guide, jumps up and down and hugs me \u2013\
  \ he\u2019s just completed his first successful \u201Cguiding\u201D. It\u2019s been\
  \ an exciting journey for the both of us, but somehow it feels like it\u2019s only\
  \ just begun."
