Text: "There I was two days left, by this time the 30+ heat and sunshine has left\
  \ me a seasoned vacationer. My skin was bronzed and salty air had given my hair\
  \ the perfect waves. I like to think mermaids wished for hair like mine, but that\
  \ is what two weeks in Cuba did to you. The ocean was frigid according to locals,\
  \ but at a comforting mid20\u2019s temp, it was welcomed breaking from piles of\
  \ snow and ice that lined my city streets. \n\nI had wondered the streets and listened\
  \ as locals regaled me with stories of time passed. I did as the Cubans do, gone\
  \ to the markets and drank the Cuban rum. A secret brand that is the \u2018best\
  \ of the best\u2019 according to the guide, who could have been a dead ringer for\
  \ Ray Charles\u2019 Cuban cousin. Alas, I wanted to experience more. All I could\
  \ in my last few days in the Caribbean paradise. \n\nI wanted to experience the\
  \ nightlife. What happens when the sun goes down during the warm nights? There were\
  \ the dance clubs with the fancy layouts and the gimmicks. All set out to entice\
  \ the tourists, but I wanted something more. Over my time there, My small group\
  \ had managed to make friends with a local. Every day we would talk to him, telling\
  \ each other of our lives in our respective parts of the world. As a last hurrah,\
  \ My friends and I had wanted a night on the town. We searched through books and\
  \ in brochures, but everything lacked authenticity filled with touristy gimmicks\
  \ and things we could find at home. \n\nThen we were suggested something by our\
  \ local \u201Ctour guide\u201D, something off the beaten path. Dressed up, we drove\
  \ through the winding streets, salty wind kissing my skin as I watched the people\
  \ chatting and laughing. It was a completely different world, where line up where\
  \ made and no matter what you were celebrating, groups kept to themselves. We pulled\
  \ up to an old brick building stairs leading up to a bright red door. No signs,\
  \ just the sound of music on the air. \n\nWalking through the doors had felt like\
  \ I stepped into old Havana. Men were dressed in suits, while the ladies were done\
  \ up all. On stage were dancers dressed in their rich blue and silver plumes. Headdresses\
  \ to make you admire their dedication and legs moving so fast to the rhythmic beat,\
  \ I was entranced. I felt I had stepped into an old black and white. I found myself\
  \ looking around the room to spot Rita Hayworth or Frank Sinatra at a table. A band\
  \ played in adjacent to the stage. Horns, drums all of it live and on the fly. It\
  \ was magical. It was warm and welcoming. It didn\u2019t matter that I was Canadian\
  \ or that I had grown up completely different. We were all there for the music,\
  \ fun and a chance to forget our troubles. I still think of how for that one moment\
  \ I really felt like I was just another Cuban."
