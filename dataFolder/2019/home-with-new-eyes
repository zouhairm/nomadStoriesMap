Text: "There I was, in the land that I found frustrating, silly, confusing and down\
  \ right bizarre, I was back home. I had not been in the US for the last three years,\
  \ to be more specific the Chicago and Milwaukee area otherwise known as part of\
  \ the Midwest. I grew up in Chicago, and for those of you from Chicago, yes in the\
  \ city, the neighborhood of Rogers Park if you must know.   \n\nI touched down in\
  \ the middle of a snowstorm and a government shut down so the feelings of frustration\
  \ and confusion remained intact. My partner was with me and it was his first time\
  \ coming to the U.S.A. He never felt the need to come to the United States but love\
  \ made him do it. While we went through security checks I heard the unmistakable\
  \ flat nasally A of my people, I giggled a little and my stomach felt lite and joyful.\
  \ We stepped out of the gate and there to the left I saw a Nuts on Clark with Chicago\
  \ mixed popcorn, I had to get some. The first bite of savory cheese and sweet caramel\
  \ hit me like a warm blanket of cuddly love. My partner was delightfully surprised\
  \ by the flavor too. My mom and sister picked us up and off we went to explore this\
  \ strange and yet familiar place. \n\nWe went as far north as Milwaukee with its\
  \ stunning museum and as far south as Chicago\u2019s Aquarium with its stunning\
  \ view of the skyline. The landscape was cold and covered in pure white snow. The\
  \ arctic had come to visit as well and covered the area in a sort of other worldly\
  \ beauty and peace. \n\nMy partner commented on how warm and friendly shopkeepers\
  \ and wait staff were (we live in Germany, its not so common here). He was amazed\
  \ by the buildings, so tall and yet in between the skyscrapers were small friendlier\
  \ buildings as well.  We went to hear jazz at the Green Mill and were amazed that,\
  \ yes, in the U.S. there are places that are still cash only and laughed in a little\
  \ hamburger place in Racine, WIS (a very interesting small city with great Frank\
  \ Lloyd Wright buildings and other gems to see) called Kewpee\u2019s were the service\
  \ was more like it is back home in Berlin. \n\nMy partner never thought he would\
  \ like the U.S. so much and I found myself falling in love with this slice of the\
  \ county, despite the freezing temperatures, in away I hadn\u2019t before. I still\
  \ find the country its self, frustrating, silly, confusing and down right bizarre\
  \ but then so is my adopted country and from what I can see one can say that about\
  \ everywhere. I guess I can say that I was surprised at how I could fall for a place\
  \ so familiar as if it was completely new to me."
