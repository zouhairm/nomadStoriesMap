Text: "`Avoid metro stations`, they told me. So here I am, rushing on Champs-\xC9\
  lys\xE9es, with my heavy backpack. `Don\u2019t miss the bus, Andreea!`, I was thinking\
  \ in my head.\nBus stations are supposed to be full with people, no? Well, this\
  \ was not the case. It was empty, no buses and no people. I panic, then I looked\
  \ around and there was a small poster. The last bus was cancel. \n`Ok\u2026`, I\
  \ told to myself taking a deep breath. `My plane leaves in the morning, no panic,\
  \ but the idea was to sleep in the airport, where I\u2019m going to sleep?` I checked\
  \ my wallet, 20 Euros and a few coins. `That won\u2019t take me far`, I am thinking.\n\
  I take my phone and I start looking for open until the morning, but guess what,\
  \ everything closes at 2 am. Meanwhile I notice a tall man, with dark hair, black\
  \ skin, wearing a red shirt and ripped jeans staring at me. I totally ignore him\
  \ and I start to walk towards a near train station, hoping they have a bench to\
  \ rest on.\nIt\u2019s midnight in a dark Paris area, I desperately pull each door\
  \ of the train station, but it\u2019s close. `God damn`, I hit the door with my\
  \ foot. I nervously pull my phone from the pocket, I drop it, I bend to take it\
  \ from the pavement and I take a quick look to my left. I see again the man with\
  \ the red shirt. I turn my head quickly into my phone, go on Google Maps and try\
  \ to find an open place to rest and feel safe. \nA big smile appeared on my face\
  \ when I found a fast-food. I grab something to eat, charged my phone and rest for\
  \ a few hours. On my way to the bathroom I looked on the window and I had the sensation\
  \ that the man in the red shirt was outside. I am thinking like `You are paranoiac,\
  \ probably tired and you get to see things`.\nAt 2 am I had to leave. I did a little\
  \ bit of research and in the aria I only found some 4 stars hotels. `I could go\
  \ there and ask them if I can stay at the reception`, I am thinking. `But what if\
  \ they kick me out?`, `No, I don\u2019t have courage to ask`. Meanwhile I felt like\
  \ somebody was following me. I bend my hand, to look like I want to scratch my back\
  \ and throw an eye and there he was, the man in the red shirt. I start waking fast\
  \ and I bump into three girls. They looked ready for a party, wearing black dresses\
  \ and hells. We chat a few minutes. I looked around and the man in red shirt was\
  \ gone. I felt relieved and then I suddenly here `Hey! Are you lost?`, `No, I am\
  \ fine!`, `You look like you need a place to stay?`, apparently it was very obvious.\
  \ `No, I am just going to crush at the hotel` and I pointed to the hotel in front\
  \ of me. `That\u2019s an expensive hotel!`. `I know!`. And then he just walks in\
  \ front of me. I was like, `He followed me around for hours just for that\u2026\
  `. \nThere was a bench in front of the hotel. I rest there and I analyzed the people\
  \ coming in and out from the hotel. Women with fur coats, men in costume, expensive\
  \ cars parked in front. \nSuddenly a car stops in front of me, and a man with blonde\
  \ hair gets out. `Are you ok? What happed? Need help?`, he asked me with a worried\
  \ tone. `Yes I am fine, my bus got canceled.` Ten minutes another person ask me\
  \ if I am ok, and then another one. I felt safe knowing that people care. At 5 am\
  \ I head back to the bus station. When I arrived there I saw people in sleeping\
  \ bags or on the ground. I felt amuse and I pictured we all have similar stories.\
  \ I rush in the bus and I figure on my way to the airport that Paris is safe in\
  \ the night or I was lucky."
