Text: "As I sat on the bed of my hotel room in Kathmandu, my curiosity was heightened\
  \ to an overarching degree. I could not comprehend why everything was white - the\
  \ walls, the bedsheets, the pillow covers, the curtains and even the doorknob. I\
  \ thought for a while and eventually my eyes started piercing a sheet of paper,\
  \ which again, was white. This sheet of paper made me spend twenty minutes of my\
  \ time in sheer agony. Tea or coffee? I always thought that coffee was the closest\
  \ thing to divinity but for some reason I decided I wanted a cup of tea. \n\nOn\
  \ my way to the Budhanilkantha Temple, I wondered what the Nepali equivalent of\
  \ word 'tea' was. My world however, came to a happy halt when I saw the sculpture\
  \ of 'The Sleeping Vishnu.' My secular being took a backseat and the snakes wrapped\
  \ around the body of Vishnu made me embrace the idea of rose tinted hope. Faith\
  \ didn't seem like a distant idea. It was as if the image of the sleeping God was\
  \ hinting towards the serenity one finds in the concept of stillness.\n\nKathmandu\
  \ had a lot to offer and what struck me the most was how bright and colourful everything\
  \ was. What I couldn't understand though, was why my hotel room chose to worship\
  \ a color that doesn't scream of its existence. This thought crossed my mind everyday\
  \ but I used to put it aside as soon as I would step outside my room.\n\nI explored\
  \ a lot. Every brick of every historical site of importance was a picture of elegance\
  \ in itself. I, according to my family, became this vanguard vehicle that preached\
  \ of the finesse that plurality entailed.\n\nMost of the tourist sites were temples.\
  \ All of them were beautiful but my favorite was the  Swayambhunath temple. My mother\
  \ asked me not to enter the temple because I was menstruating at the time. I didn't\
  \ protest because you \"don't bite the hand that feeds you.\" I quietly sat on a\
  \ bench. An old lady dressed in the most colorful saree approched me. She gently\
  \ placed her hand on my shoulder and said, \"chai.\" Chai! Chai means tea in my\
  \ mother tongue. It was at that moment that this foreign land seemed familiar. I\
  \ always loved the colors around me but now they made sense. I understood them.\
  \ I bought a cup of chai from her. And then, after an hour or so, we all went back\
  \ to the hotel room. My stay in Nepal, like everything else, eventually came to\
  \ an end.\n\nMy locus amoenus now involves tea in a white cup. You see, we add meanings\
  \ to the meaningless. We fill in the colors. And above all, faith is nothing but\
  \ chai."
