Text: "I fell in love with a city when I was having coffee in Haight Street, full\
  \ of people, and one men passed by wearing only his pink underwear and flaunting\
  \ his hairy belly. He walked on that sunny Wednesday in San Francisco and no one\
  \ looked. No one cared about that seemingly irreverent scene. Only me who watched\
  \ attentively and just wanted to stay there, looking at the coming and going of\
  \ a place that accepts you as you are.\n     Meanwhile, the president was talking\
  \ about expanding border walls. In Brazil, the news revolved around the controversial\
  \ fact that homosexuality could be considered a disease in the country. But that\
  \ day, California brought me to forget the walls made of concrete or built through\
  \ the law. The place showed its open doors, in which I read several posters of \u201C\
  San Francisco accepts all kinds of people\u201D, \u201CWhoever you are, you are\
  \ safe here\u201D.\n    While I knew the town, I felt small. I come from a country\
  \ where irreverent clothing, hair and lifestyles are meant for niches. In general,\
  \ people are sexist and not receptive to the different. We have the world's highest\
  \ LGBT murder rate.\n    California can teach a lot about the art of socializing,\
  \ it defies the conservative wind that blows through the world nowadays and invites\
  \ everyone to a cool show of empathy.\n    At night, a cozy bar offered a concert\
  \ and housed people of all ages. All the hair colors were there, including the very\
  \ whites. What a delight to be in a city where everyone joins together the sound\
  \ of a great soundtrack.\n    I went to another bar, where I was drinking with three\
  \ men practicing polyamory. \u201CIt's as if I'm living a dream\u201D, a beloved\
  \ Brazilian, who made his nest in San Francisco, told me. What a delight to believe\
  \ that one only place can belong to everyone. \n    We took our car and went to\
  \ the incredible blue-sky roads of Big Sur. I daresay \u2014 and I come from a country\
  \ where we smile and hug a lot \u2014 that I have never been so well-received in\
  \ life. Friendly people in a location that boasts a mother's heart.\n    I know,\
  \ San Fran, you have your faults and I did not stay long enough to meet them. But\
  \ everyone with whom I could express my overwhelming passion, who chose you as home,\
  \ did not disagree with me.\n    Max, my new friend in silver shorts who smoked\
  \ on the sidewalk of the bar where I was, told me that this town is where all the\
  \ queers come to meet. But I think every place is an invitation. There are cities\
  \ that make you want to hide your true clothes at home, because being equal is also\
  \ being safe. Others, like SF, are an invitation to be true to ourselves. Its streets,\
  \ evenings and days are also open doors. Today this is not an easy thing to find.\n\
  \    \u201CYou are safe here\u201D, it echoed in my head as we continued on the\
  \ road to Las Vegas, and I was already missing the place I fell in love with. I\
  \ started to imagine San Francisco as a unique country inside another, with its\
  \ colorful and contagious power. I imagined it taking the shape of a continent,\
  \ expanding, growing and becoming a planet. \n    I shook my head and heard the\
  \ sounds of the present. I now listen to the Brazilian news and I can feel the coldness\
  \ of the conservative wave that has hit us. I continue to be in love with a city\
  \ by the Bay. San Francisco, in 2019, you are resistance and I think I'm still there,\
  \ standing on a Haight Street\xB4s coffee feeling like it's my home."
