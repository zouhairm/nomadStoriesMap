Text: "I am the kind of girl who jumps on every opportunity to travel to a new place.\
  \ But as much as I'd be excited about the trip, I'll be apprehensive about the challenges\
  \ that I might face. As I traveled more, I started getting comfortable with the\
  \ discomforts that accompany it. And the major highlight of all these progressive\
  \ changes in me was my trip to Bled.\nBled is famous for the panoramic lake views\
  \ on a bright sunny day. But as luck would have it, it was raining the whole time\
  \ I was in the town. Though it was a little discouraging, I still wanted to go out\
  \ and see the much-praised postcard views of Bled.\nMy hostel's host had suggested\
  \ two hikes that I should do. And as unplanned and under-prepared I am, I didn't\
  \ do any research and just asked him the difficulty level of both the hikes. I needed\
  \ this information to gauge my capability of completing these hikes by myself and\
  \ also for the motivation to actually go for them.\nThe first hike according to\
  \ him was simple, and the second one a little more advanced, but had better views.\n\
  \LAround 10:00 am when it finally stopped raining, I hurried out of my room with\
  \ my impatient feet eagerly pushing me. \nI started with my first hike to the Straza\
  \ viewpoint. There were two trails to reach the top, one amidst the forest and the\
  \ other one through the meadows. I hiked up through the meadows, but I didn't want\
  \ to re-iterate the same path on my way back, so I decided to go down the forested\
  \ trail. Incidentally, there was not a single person around the area, both while\
  \ coming up and going down.\nWhile I casually climbed the hill, it was a lot trickier\
  \ hiking down. With the rain pouring constantly and leaves brushing against me,\
  \ I somehow managed to come out of my tiny scared self and reached down in one piece.\
  \ It was a joyous little moment for me overcoming my inner fears and at the same\
  \ time having the best views to just myself - the picturesque clouded greens.\n\
  I was already soaked in the rain by the time I got down, so I thought to myself\
  \ that it is ok if I don't do the second hike - it was anyway a little challenging.\
  \ But when I told my hostel's host about it, he said, the second hike, though a\
  \ little hard and unsafe during rains, it has the most beautiful views. The words\
  \ that stuck in my mind and kept repeating in a loop were, \"it has the most beautiful\
  \ views\". At that very moment, I decided to go to Ojstrica and check these views\
  \ for myself.\nSince my shoes were wet from the rain, so I wore flip-flops instead,\
  \ assuming it'll be fine, and hiking in them won't be too strenuous. But given that\
  \ it had rained all afternoon, wearing flip-flops was not a very good choice it\
  \ seems.\nI started hiking without giving much thought to the difficulty level.\
  \ It was a minute after walking on the muddy trail, I asked someone who was already\
  \ descending, the difficulty level of the hike. I was suggested to not go further\
  \ for I was wearing flip-flops and the rocks were very slippery.\nIt did not affect\
  \ my determination though because, one, I had already walked a lot after I left\
  \ my hostel to do that hike, second, I wanted to see the view that was so talked\
  \ about. So undeterred, I kept climbing unaffected by the people who crossed me\
  \ wondering how I am going to make it. I kept my pace slow and steady without trying\
  \ to hurry up.\nAs I started nearing the top of the hill, the muddy path became\
  \ rockier. I took extra care to not slip on a wet rock. And when I finally reached\
  \ the top.....\n\"The view too beautiful to be described in words!\"\n\nI am so\
  \ glad that I did these two hikes - I didn't only experience the most amazing views\
  \ but also overcame my fears and discomforts which till date I am so proud of."
