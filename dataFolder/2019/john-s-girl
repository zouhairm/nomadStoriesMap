Text: "There\u2019s a story on his lips and I wait, patiently sipping my lager. It\u2019\
  s barely noon. This is beer number two. He lifts a bottle to his lips, condensation\
  \ sticky between label and palm. A sigh of tension has slipped between the lightness\
  \ of our conversation. I watch his eyes follow the tilt of the drink upwards, unshaven\
  \ cheeks pink from the morning\u2019s exertion and sun. \n\n\u201COne morning I\
  \ was woken up, dragged outside and pointed in the direction of my car. Not a scratch\
  \ or streak of dirt, except\u2026both the front and back of it had been crushed,\
  \ a foot of each end missing. I\u2019d driven it home the night before but couldn\u2019\
  t remember anything.\u201D His hands measure a foot of air between palms as he speaks,\
  \ eyes cast between the distance into a past I can\u2019t see. There\u2019s a pause,\
  \ our jovial mood from moments before held between those hands, suspended. \nHis\
  \ eyes move to me, something else measured now. \n\n\u201CAnd that\u2019s when I\
  \ knew I had to change.\u201D The admission is raw, unplanned. Unexpected. \n\n\
  Sitting across from me is my dad. \n\nA day\u2019s travel: two flights - one restricted\
  \ and challenged by 400 feet of landing strip abutted by sheer cliff - a ride in\
  \ the bed of a pick-up, a trek up too many stairs, and finally: Saba. A small Caribbean\
  \ island with the tallest peak in the Netherlands, Saba\u2019s just a stone\u2019\
  s throw from St. Martin, boasting brilliant views, amazing dive sites and a conservation\
  \ program that\u2019s inspired this whole trip.    \nGoats herded off the tarmac\
  \ upon our arrival, their bleats accompanied by the whirl of propellers and waves\
  \ crashing against the island\u2019s shore. The airport itself is a thatched roof,\
  \ a metal trench from which to collect bags, no walls and, of course, a bar. From\
  \ behind the counter, the bartender moves from his post only to don a security cap,\
  \ switching roles from libations expert to customs officer. The first of many private\
  \ smiles is exchanged. \n\nPast the open walls, Saba rises relentlessly. A single\
  \ road skirts cliffs, hugging Mount Scenery, as it snakes its way around the volcano\
  \ and dips into villages of red-roofed cottages. Sun and heat and ocean breeze stain\
  \ my lips with salt. There\u2019s work to do but momentarily we\u2019re stilled\
  \ by the mysteries of the cloud-shrouded peak before us, a landscape of sun-stoked\
  \ tropics and bleached-white rocks.\n\nI don\u2019t think my father or I had expected\
  \ my answer to be yes when he\u2019d floated the idea of this conservation trip\
  \ to me months before. We aren\u2019t estranged, just unfamiliar. Neither of us\
  \ would ever imagine that Saba would become an uncompromising part of his identity\
  \ in the years to come. That this island and its community would charm him back\
  \ year after year, impressing on him a sense of home and belonging; that his sudden\
  \ death less than a decade later would devastate the locals here as much as the\
  \ rest of us back home. \n\nBut this is his first time here, and mine too.\n\nA\
  \ week into working side-by-side, into navigating a relationship that has never\
  \ felt natural, we\u2019re changing. Hard work reaps respect, a well-deserved beer\
  \ cushions conversations, and this island, with all its mysteries, has forged a\
  \ territory of shared awe. Suddenly my father isn\u2019t so unfamiliar. In the company\
  \ of sunbathing iguanas, he tells me of his mistakes, an adolescence of drug and\
  \ alcohol abuse, of regrets and lessons. Against backdrops of cloud forests, he\
  \ whispers of meeting my mom and changing his life. And in turn, I share too - Saba\
  \ gives us \u2018us.\u2019 \n\nIn the years following, I\u2019d recall these conversations\
  \ in moments of camaraderie or disagreement and be reminded of that \u2018us\u2019\
  . Those memories and that connection would be both precious and heartbreaking when\
  \ he was gone. \n\nAnd I\u2019d return to Saba. I\u2019d step back onto the tarmac,\
  \ heat against my skin; air thick with memories of him. I\u2019d walk into the airport,\
  \ towards the bar and hand my passport to the bartender who occasionally acts as\
  \ a customs officer. I'd watch him read my name. And with recognition in his eyes,\
  \ he\u2019d look up and say, \n\n-\u201CYou\u2019re John\u2019s girl.\u201D"
