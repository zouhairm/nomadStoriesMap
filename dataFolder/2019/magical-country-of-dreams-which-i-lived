Text: "I never knew that this will happen it was something just like the dreams which\
  \ i see in stars sitting by my window every night watching moon and telling him\
  \ that one day i will visit to the place of my dreams.\nYou wont believe it was\
  \ so unexpected i went Malaysia \U0001F1F2\U0001F1FE for a conference of four days\
  \ and the city tour which was a part of conference made me stick back to such a\
  \ beautiful country. City tour for me was just a summary of the places to visit\
  \ to country but i have never thought that it would change my travelling reason\
  \ to malaysia i mean from conference now i wanted to travel and explore Malaysia\
  \ i mean every single market, malls,etc etc.\nIt all started from 14 jan a life\
  \ turing point in my travel experience. My journey starts with the \u201C city of\
  \ twin towers - KUALA LUMPUR \u201C . In the breezing night with soft cold winds\
  \ and time was around 2-3 actually midnight the twin towers gloomed and glow with\
  \ the lights which sparkles and best to be here at this time was the show of cars\
  \ of all brands and models and colours racing performed by local people ... place\
  \ is different at night and morning and have importance accordingly. Next when i\
  \ woke up in a room with best view of city was so refreshing that it made my day\
  \ ... i got ready , gathered my things and yes camera most importantly and also\
  \ a guide to the city ...\nI started again with twin towers may be i was in love\
  \ with the place then comes the best for person like me who is addicted to chocolates\
  \ the great chocolate factory of malaysia globally famous for chocolates \u201C\
  Harriston signature chocolates\u201D factory . This place was like gem here i have\
  \ found chocolate for all skin type , body , disease etc and best part it was cheapest.\
  \ It was unbelievable actually.\nNext was thing i love to do most in my free time\
  \ that is shopping i can do it even when i m not free ... so here was this place\
  \ \u201CCentral Market\u201D another amazing place i found you it was unbelievable\
  \ the market was a pool of small shops from all countries with there speciality\u2019\
  s i mean from india to china every country was there . And most amazing thing i\
  \ got was a pendant which i m still wearing which real malaysia flower inside and\
  \ which glows in dark the flower which you can find on malaysia ringgit notes ,\
  \ symbol of the country.\n\nNow it was time to visit the government palace of yhe\
  \ country putra jaya ... it had most beautiful and scared heart taking away mosque\
  \ and parliament of the country and also place had india restaurant with great food\
  \ . \nNext day it batu caves to come along the way .. they were hindu temples in\
  \ cave beautiful and peaceful ao statisfactory and relaxing... there are many more\
  \ things to write and express but short words . This was my story to malaysia it\
  \ was like a dream from which i never want to wake up.\n\nThankyou"
