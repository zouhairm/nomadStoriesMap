Text: "Spaniards know how to strike. Earlier this year, thousands of taxi drivers\
  \ in Madrid went on strike for almost 2 weeks. They parked across the Paseo de la\
  \ Castellana, the main artery, obstructing traffic for days. On March 8, International\
  \ Women's Day, millions of women across Spain went on strike. My Spanish school\
  \ was eerily quiet, though I still had class since my teacher was a man. The strike\
  \ was well organized: teachers told their students not to come to class, shopkeepers\
  \ told me to come back the next day, screens in the metro announced that 60% of\
  \ the trains would be on time. \n\n     On \"El D\xEDa de la Mujer,\" I hurriedly\
  \ hailed a cab to take me to a seminar called \"The Rules of Attraction to Your\
  \ Man.\" It promised to teach women things like why the men we like don't want to\
  \ marry us and the 5 keys to love success that only some women know. The irony that\
  \ a massive Women's March was in progress elsewhere in Madrid was not lost on the\
  \ audience of 8. \"Why did you come?\" One woman asked, just as I was about to ask\
  \ her the same. \"For entertainment and out of curiosity.\" \"And you?\" \"Exactly,\"\
  \ she said with a chuckle. \"Me, too.\"\n\n     I had been in Spain for 2 months\
  \ and it would be difficult to explain my other reasons in Spanish to a complete\
  \ stranger. Yes, it would be a fun way to practice Spanish. I\u2019d also have a\
  \ good laugh at cheesy and sexist advice on female attractiveness. I wanted a good\
  \ story. But a small part of me, the 40 year-old, never married part, wondered if\
  \ I might be one of those benighted women who didn't know the keys to love. Maybe\
  \ I would learn something life-changing.\n\n     The speaker wore her hair in soft\
  \ waves with a flower tucked behind one ear, a scarf and statement jewelry. She\
  \ looked every bit the \"feelings life coach\" who had a large and international\
  \ (thanks to Skype) clientele. She opened with an explanation about how men fall\
  \ in love differently than women. Due to hormonal differences, sex was a necessary\
  \ but insufficient part of male emotional attachment. Okay, maybe this isn't pseudoscience,\
  \ I thought. Next, she told us about her own romantic devastation and recovery,\
  \ leading to her current career. I started to feel guilty about my preconceptions.\
  \ This wasn't a joke, this was real psychology. \n\n     So I did learn the 5 \"\
  keys,\" and more. While I can't explain them all here, this is what sticks with\
  \ me most: to have success in romantic relationships, women need to create a sense\
  \ of otherness, a magnetism between opposites, between the feminine and masculine\
  \ symbolized by yin and yang. This is what creates sexual attraction. A common problem\
  \ is that an \"alpha\" type of woman might want to be with an \"alpha\" man similar\
  \ to herself, but in fact she attracts the more passive \"beta\" types and alpha\
  \ men aren't interested. In order to attract an alpha man, she needs to play a different\
  \ role. Equally important: successful women create and maintain emotional connections.\
  \ \"We have different abilities in this due to our upbringing and other factors,\"\
  \ the speaker said, \"but we can all improve.\"\n\n     I didn't agree with everything\
  \ in the presentation. I didn't agree with the implicit definition of female success\
  \ being marrying a \"quality\" man or moving in with a new boyfriend within 6 months\
  \ of arriving in a new country, for example. Yet much of society still appraises\
  \ women this way. Emotional labor is still considered women's work. Should it be\
  \ so? And is it ethical or healthy to play a role that feels unnatural if we think\
  \ it will get us what we want? \n\n     People tell me that I should improve my\
  \ ability to connect, and they\u2019re right. Living in Spain has exposed me to\
  \ a stronger culture of solidarity and emotional connection compared to the U.S.\
  \ The Spanish strikes wouldn't have happened otherwise. There\u2019s no simple explanation\
  \ of how, but if I can strengthen the connections with and among the people in my\
  \ life right now\u2014family, friends, patients, coworkers, even someone reading\
  \ this\u2014I will have succeeded."
