Text: "At Tbilisi train station, I was waiting to board the overnight train to Zugdidi.\
  \ The station brought back memories of travelling with my parents from Karachi to\
  \ Bahawalpur. Our platforms are bustling with portals, travellers and people bidding\
  \ farewell to travellers. Here i was standing at a huge empty space, except for\
  \ the few travellers. On the platform I saw people standing near by their compartments,\
  \ I did the same. \nThat\u2019s when I heard someone approach me, \n\u201Cthis train\
  \ is going to be shit, you should get an upgrade.\u201D \n\u201CWell, doesn\u2019\
  t matter\u201D I brushed him off. \nI was hurting inside, less than 4 weeks ago\
  \ I had buried a young 11 yr old gun shot victim. Her father, Umer, my husband\u2019\
  s cousin and she, Amal, like my own niece. Georgia was my escape. I had flown to\
  \ Tiblisi this morning, been singaled out at airport immigration for being a Muslim.\
  \ The state of this train was far better than the state of my heart.\n\u201CWhere\
  \ are you from?\u201D He asked me, even though I had moved my face in the other\
  \ direction to avoid conversation \n\u201CI am from Pakistan and you \n\u201CI am\
  \ french\u201D\nHe looked Indian, he probably thought I was too. Outside Pakistan,\
  \ I often get mistaken for a taller fairer Indian. We do have the same gene pool,\
  \ our body shape and mannerisms are similar. Tonight, I didn\u2019t have the energy\
  \ for small talk. This was the first time in a month being on my own without my\
  \ kids, without my family, outside Karachi, outside of where the incidence took\
  \ place... I was not in a happy place and I moved away from this chatty guy.\n\n\
  Finally we were allowed into our compartments. I deposited my suitcase. It was hot\
  \ inside, I came out for a breath of fresh air, once the train was ready to leave\
  \ I hopped back on and now my compartment was full of huge suitcases and hiking\
  \ bags. Standing outside, were a couple of guys chatting to people in the compartment\
  \ next to mine. We greeted each other. Friendly smiles. Enthusiastic chatter till\
  \ someone asked \u2018where are you from\u2019 \u2018Pakistan\u2019 And my words\
  \ drained colour from the guy standing in front of me. \n\u2018Where are you from?\u2019\
  \ I asked \n\u2018israel\u2019 he replied coldly. Everyone went silent around us.\
  \ He moved away. Pakistan does not recognise Israel. This guy and his two buddies\
  \ had recently finished their military training. And here we were going to be stuck\
  \ in a compartment of 4 for the night. I sat on my seat, eyes on my book, passages\
  \ floated on the page as I overheard him giving others a heads up about my country,\
  \ our nuclear weapons and our enmity with India. \n\nOne of them came in the compartment\
  \ and started talking to me. He said his friend was being impolite. I asked him\
  \ where they were headed and gradually we eased into a conversation despite my heavy\
  \ heart. \n\nThis was his first interaction with a Pakistani, Muslim woman. He was\
  \ surprised. No hijab, no broken English, no aggression. Thank you media! Real life\
  \ is stranger than fiction. To me he was like one of my university students, full\
  \ of ideas, uncertain about future. He spoke about his family, his brother, his\
  \ mother. He had the kindest brown eyes and a short crew cut. I talked about my\
  \ sons, my husband and the tragedy eating my insides. Its when I spoke about death\
  \ that we both connected. We talked late into the night till finally i fell asleep.\
  \ His friends eventually claimed their bunks and i could understand snippets about\
  \ me. They were curious too. \n\nIn the morning we went our own way, except we were\
  \ happier, lighter and more informed about each other. Him a 21 year old looking\
  \ to work in the IT industry and me a 44 year old having a hard time letting go\
  \ of a child."
