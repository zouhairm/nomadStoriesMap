Text: "Upon stepping inside Al-Aqsa, I saw no one else other than the masjid. \n\n\
  Men and women shared the same entrance, the same shoe cubbies, men passed through\
  \ the women\u2019s section to get to the men\u2019s section, men and women who knew\
  \ each other greeted one another, sat together and talked about their respective\
  \ families. This was unlike other masjids I had attended. \nMen and women interacted\
  \ with one another in a respectful manner. Men and women sat together with little\
  \ hesitation, in complete comfort, and no one reprimanded them, no one gave a second\
  \ glance to them, it didn\u2019t lead to sin or blasphemy; the world didn\u2019\
  t crumble. \n\nI focused on the arches and poles, the red carpets and the new digital\
  \ prayer clock to my right. Ten minutes to prayer time. I walked past a line of\
  \ older, fragile woman, praying seated. I sat at an empty spot near a brother and\
  \ two sisters sitting together talking and laughing. I stared at the carpet, combed\
  \ through it and committed the pattern to memory when a Muslim girl with down syndrome\
  \ dressed in a red hijab and burgundy dress sat beside me and smiled at me. I hardly\
  \ noticed the older women behind me until one of the younger women in her forties\
  \ came up to me. \n\n\u201CAs\u2019salamu Alaikum, my daughter,\u201D she said to\
  \ me as she tapped and stood over my right shoulder, wearing a black hijab and a\
  \ traditional Palestinian embroidered dress. \n\n\u201CWa\u2019Alaikum As\u2019\
  salaam,\u201D Looking up at her. \n\n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D she asked with\
  \ a maternal look on her face. I could tell she wasn\u2019t questioning me as others\
  \ had that day; she was making conversation. \n\n\u201CAmerica,\u201D I said without\
  \ a second thought. \n\n\u201CDid you pray two rak\u2019as? One prayer here is worth\
  \ 500 prayers. My daughter, pray two rak\u2019as and then it is almost time for\
  \ Asr prayer... Come back and pray with us.\u201D She stroked my shoulder and walked\
  \ away. \n\nI got up and prayed two rak\u2019as or at least I thought I did. I became\
  \ so focused on the words and the meaning of words in prayer that I lost track of\
  \ how many rak\u2019as I prayed.\n\nAnd then the adhan peacefully shot through the\
  \ loudspeakers and through my ears as I got up and turned around. The woman from\
  \ before had walked halfway towards me, reaching out her right hand to me. She grasped\
  \ my left hand and put me in line between an older woman in a chair, wearing a white\
  \ hijab and a traditional Palestinian embroidered dress, and a young woman, my age,\
  \ dressed in beige from head-to-toe. The motherly figure pushed us closer together,\
  \ forcing some of the women in chairs to move their chairs closer to the standing\
  \ women. The masjid wasn\u2019t crowded, but we crowded together, shoulder-to-shoulder,\
  \ as our organizer said, \n\n\u201CLeave no space for the devil to sit between us.\
  \ There is no room for the devil here.\u201D She continued to crowd us together,\
  \ repeating herself and made sure that we not only left no space for the devil but\
  \ that we stood in a perfectly straight line. \n\n\u2018Asr prayer commenced, it\
  \ was the first time I had prayed in a group in a year. It was the first time I\
  \ ever felt comfortable in group prayer. As I said my teary-eyed As\u2019salaamu\
  \ Alaikums right-and-left, I looked for the woman who invited me to pray but couldn\u2019\
  t find her. She must have left without my noticing. I wanted to thank her for inviting\
  \ me in, but I never got the chance to tell her. I couldn\u2019t help but feel that\
  \ my prayers had been answered and that this very moment itself was my home."
