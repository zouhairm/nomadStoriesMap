Text: "My first experience to Japan was simply breath taking. I visited Kiyoto for\
  \ the first time because I always wanted to experience the life of a geisha. In\
  \ Japan Geisha is a Artist. Geisha is the art of conversation and music. Geisha\
  \ also serves as a entertaining assistant to guest in Japanese games and entertainment.\n\
  \ I am a very huge influencer when it comes to music. I was born with the essence\
  \ of music, song, chant, and dance. In Japan I recognized that Hawai\u2019i plays\
  \ a very huge role in the Japanese Cultural events. The Art Of Hula is a very big\
  \ commodity to the Japanese people. The way they mimic each Hula movement with grace\
  \ and elegance. It can be hypnotizing. In Japan there are more Hula Schools, then\
  \ their are in Hawai\u2019i. People travel from miles away to take a Hula lesson\
  \ in Japan. I am truly amazed especially being that I am a native of how much Hawai\u2019\
  i has a huge influence on Japan. The Japanese people carry the Hawaiian culture\
  \ with such respect, honor and dignity, even with the initiatives to learn the native\
  \ tongue. I would love visit Japan again I\u2019m the future, in hopes to gain more\
  \ experience if there lifestyle, custom and ways of living. I believe we all come\
  \ a culture and it truly is about giving honor and respect to all who are worthy."
