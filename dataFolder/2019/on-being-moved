Text: "On December 18th, 2017, I cried. \n\nNotably cried too because I wrote it down.\
  \ After wandering circles around Chapters Indigo (\u2018Indigo Chapters\u2019, just\
  \ \u2018Indigo\u2019, etc. etc.), I gave up at searching for sweet sweet discounts,\
  \ and began flipping through books on art\u2014because Indigo Chapters Chapters\
  \ Indigo Indigo has coolly branched out\u2014and found one on the works of the Group\
  \ of Seven. \n\nOf course I had heard of the Gof7 before; elementary school gave\
  \ us all a solid glimpse. However, it wasn\u2019t until I was seeing their work\
  \ on thick, crisp paper in a hardcover book that I truly awed at their historical\
  \ pieces. I stopped at \u2018Mt Lefroy\u2019, by Lawren Harris. \n\nThis is what\
  \ took my breath away. At first glance, it seems like a sort of \u2018paint-by-numbers\u2019\
  \ artist\u2019s interpretation, attempting to compress the landscape\u2019s vastness\
  \ into a more accessible piece to the public\u2019s eye (and much later, to that\
  \ of the Calendar Club). \n\nStill paused on the same page and I remember when I\
  \ saw Lefroy in person: earlier that year, 2017, sitting on a rock on the edge of\
  \ the Plain of Six Glaciers trail in Lake Louise, Alberta. \n\nRunning my fingers\
  \ over the page, and Lawren Harris has perfectly shown the mountain\u2019s perpetual\
  \ capture of the best sunlight. \nHis slopes simultaneously show a mountain\u2019\
  s threatening sharpness, and its beautiful \nun-touchability. \nMoving to turn the\
  \ page, and I almost dog-ear the corner in hesitation. A $40 book and I\u2019m almost\
  \ CREASING THE EDGES. I caught myself.  \n\nOn the right side of the mountain is\
  \ the \u201CDeath Trap\u201D; a sheer drop, white and seamless, with no sign of\
  \ where it begins. I\u2019m remembering stories of people losing their lives at\
  \ the hands of Mt. Lefroy. First reported missing, then found without breath. I\u2019\
  m at the lookout, watching the helicopter circle, then fly to the village for fuel,\
  \ come back, circle, and return again, over and over, searching for any sign of\
  \ them, and I sit still. \n\nThe lines become more pronounced, there\u2019s a sharp\
  \ division between light and dark, side-by-side, just the right amount of ominousness\
  \ without detracting from the overall splendor. \n\nBehind the mountain is British\
  \ Columbia. More space is so close, but I\u2019m fenced in. I can breathe, and be\
  \ still, but I can\u2019t shake the fact that my horizon is now that much higher,\
  \ and myself that much smaller. \n\nThe left of the frame paints like the great\
  \ unknown. At times it looks unappealing, but at others it\u2019s what I want but\
  \ just can\u2019t have. I am basking in the brilliance of Lefroy\u2019s white on\
  \ the one hand, but the other is a part of that fence of mine. \n\nStanding in that\
  \ store, in that mall, listening to Mariah belt that Christmas song overhead; I\u2019\
  ve gotten out. Where I am now, Ontario, the land is flat and accessible; I can go\
  \ anywhere it seems. \nBut nothing will compare to the terrified awe of looking\
  \ at Mt. Lefroy. Little as I was, I felt humbled, like I was put in my place. The\
  \ land isn\u2019t ours to occupy. Thrill seekers or big thinkers as we may be, some\
  \ things will always be out of reach. I learned this sitting on that rock, and again\
  \ looking at the painting that is absolutely not a \u2018paint-by-numbers\u2019\
  .\n\n\u2026Mom, I\u2019m fine I just need a minute."
