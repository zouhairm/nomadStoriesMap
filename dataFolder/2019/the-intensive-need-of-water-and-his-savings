Text: "As you all know Pakistan is an agricultural country. Our economy is largely\
  \ based on agricultural exports.  But due to the negligence of our leaders, we didn't\
  \ build any dam in the last couple of decades. Our existing dams, Mangla and Tarbela\
  \ are dying. Mores of water are going in Arabia Sea unused. On the other hand, India\
  \ is building a lot of dams in Kashmir and diverting the course of Pakistan's water.\
  \ Mangla is totally dried up! The situation is only going to get worse. More than\
  \ 80 percent of water in Pakistan is considered unsafe. Meanwhile, in 2017, the\
  \ Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) announced that Pakistan\
  \ would run out of the water by 2025.\nThe only solution is to build dams as soon\
  \ as possible and plant as many trees as we can. Otherwise, we could face a situation\
  \ like that of Cape Town. We urge the Government of Pakistan to start work on all\
  \ pending dam projects on first priority. Please sign this petition; let's try to\
  \ save the future of the next generations. Water is not just for human consumption\
  \ but also necessary for agricultural development, electricity production, environmental\
  \ stability, and many others. I\u2019m worried about the alarming condition of water\
  \ scarcity we are about to face. I am advocating dams and water reservoirs since\
  \ flood started hitting south Punjab as it was the sign of following lack of water.\
  \ The govt is of view that the maintenance cost of dams is usually too high and\
  \ so in long run, they are not feasible. In the moon soon we lost water of billions\
  \ dollar worth. China has used a new tech that helps maintain dams effectively and\
  \ efficiently and it must not be an excuse to lose water. Apart from it, India is\
  \ creating so many dams on our river and water which is alarming for the defense\
  \ of Pakistan. Our crops are being affected. Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court agreed\
  \ to hear cases on the water shortage in Pakistan, beginning June 7. The hearings\
  \ will particularly focus on the proposed Kalabagh Dam on the Indus River. The dam\
  \ could increase Pakistan\u2019s dismal water storage capacity while providing 3,600\
  \ megawatts of electricity. In the past, Pakistan\u2019s political parties have\
  \ been unable to reach an agreement on the dam, a hurdle activists hope the Supreme\
  \ Court will be able to overcome. \nAttempts to build dams in Pakistan have been\
  \ riddled with land conflict, political disagreements, and international disputes\
  \ with India. Since it has become clear that water stress is a major issue in Pakistan,\
  \ efforts have been made for Pakistan to build dams. In recent months, WAPDA has\
  \ been attempting to build the Diamer-Bhasha Dam. The dam lies between the two provinces\
  \ Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) which has led to conflict and\
  \ land disputes. Those who claim to hold ownership over the contested land have\
  \ even become violent. Each time dam construction commences, local\u2019s fire on\
  \ workers. So far, 12 have been killed at the construction site.\nPakistan\u2019\
  s most highly produced crops are wheat, rice, cotton, and sugarcane. Although these\
  \ are agricultural staples, they are also the most water-intensive crops on the\
  \ planet. These crops are hardly drought resistance, so if Pakistan did experience\
  \ water scarcity, it would could an economic and humanitarian disaster."
