Text: "Your dreams are coming true. This one , oversimplified statement clouded my\
  \ thoughts as I tried to make my anxious mind find solitude in the city which transformes\
  \ millions of lives everyday. \nThe land of the free. Yet,  as I sat in a sweaty\
  \ seat of the cheapest bus available, with my heart racing to the beat of an overplayed\
  \ song,  I couldn\u2019t comprehend the essence of freedom...\nThe spectrum of the\
  \ sunset illuminated through the stained glass windows hit my journey-tired pupils;\
  \ the same sun that 6 hours ago I saw 3333 miles away.  Though every atom in my\
  \ body loudly prohibited me from appreciating the beauty of the city, overthinking\
  \ about the disappointment my childhood perception of the \u2018city of dreams\u2019\
  \ will bring , I was determined to go against all senses and appreciate the magic\
  \ I longed for. \nThe engine started roaring and, with the intense heat of the sun\
  \ still on my face, I observed the details as we moved slowly through the never\
  \ ending Manhattan traffic, behind the famous yellow taxi. It\u2019s true, what\
  \ they tell you, New York has a lively heart; I saw people race the streets with\
  \ eagerness and passion in their eyes, men with black suitcases containing what\
  \ were probably the world\u2019s finances entering a skyscraper confidently, and\
  \ women stumbling across the uneven pavement in their high heels and perfectly fitted\
  \ office skirts. The people brought energy, movement and emotion which splashed\
  \ against the canvas of the architecture. The manmade buildings crowded above us,\
  \ with windows too high to visualise, they provided a stark, static permanence to\
  \ a town that is constantly evolving. Seeing the endless, unique restaurants competing\
  \ for customers with their \u2018pizza for a dollar\u2019 options made my stomach\
  \ happy with even the thought of endeavouring a famous New York Pizza slice. I felt\
  \ small and invisible surrounded by what seemed like every culture in the world.\
  \ But I wanted to stop looking at the bigger picture: as we entered the busiest\
  \ part of the City I looked out of the window at the secrets, the hidden parts that\
  \ I never envisioned when thinking about the idealistic city I was now a part of.\
  \ I witnessed a homeless man, misery painted upon his wrinkled face, he was sat\
  \ like a child on the dirty pavement leaning against an overflowing bin and begging\
  \ passers by to give him at least a second of attention in their hectic day. Blinded\
  \ by the \u201Acity that never sleeps\u2019,  no one stopped and no one listened.\
  \ My journey continued, but the man remained clearly drawn out in my mind. Soon,\
  \ it was time to leave the comfort of the bus and put my two feet on the ground\
  \ of this strange place. I stepped outside and was immediately hit with an unfamiliar,\
  \ distinct smell of petrol and sweat. In front of me was a correlation of colourful\
  \ flags representing each nation, showing a united world. Before I could even slightly\
  \ turn my head to see more, I was rushed to the grand entrance of the Rockefeller\
  \ centre through the crowd of people all moving in a different direction and shouting\
  \ in different languages, each one with a different purpose. After walking up a\
  \ staircase, holding tightly unto the golden railing in order to keep my balance\
  \ and not become too overwhelmed with the expenses of my surroundings, a polite\
  \ man gave me a list of instructions in a matter of fact tone. The only sentence\
  \ I managed to understand in the chaos was \u201Cyou are going 66 floors up to have\
  \ the best ever experience, have fun.\u201D And so the red digital numbers in the\
  \ lift increased: 1, 30,66. The doors opened slowly and the New York skyline greeted\
  \ me with its undeniable beauty. The silhouette created by Manhattan\u2019s buildings\
  \ was instantly recognisable from the canvas picture that hangs in my room, it was\
  \ utterly mesmerising. The buildings rose like trees above the barely visible crowds\
  \ of people: a true concrete jungle. Yet, I felt an aching in my heart because I\
  \ knew that in the midst of this jungle was mystery. The secret individuals, with\
  \ a dark past that remain hidden behind glorified buildings and businessmen. They,\
  \ too, are a part of this city. It was at that moment that I finally reached a conclusion\
  \ that New York isn\u2019t a \u2018city of dreams\u2019. It is a city of contrast:\
  \ contrasting people, contrasting buildings, contrasting life stories, contrasting\
  \ cultures. Today,  I thank the homeless man for showing me that to fully experience\
  \ what it means to be a New Yorker it\u2019s important to immerse yourself in the\
  \ reality of contrast."
