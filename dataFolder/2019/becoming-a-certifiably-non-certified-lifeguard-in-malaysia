  \ gear, climb Batu Kuching, watch the sun rise, cliff jump into the ocean, and swim\
  \ back to camp,\u201D I review the plan with Denzel. \n \n\u201CAre you taking flip\
  \ flops?\u201D he interrupts. \n\nIt\u2019s a tough call. We\u2019d walked up Batu\
  \ Kuching barefoot last time, but that was in daylight, and before the mangrove\
  \ snake, one of the most poisonous in Malaysia, had started making daily appearances\
  \ around camp. We\u2019d also grown a lot wiser about the other island perils: red\
  \ ants, termites, poisonous millipedes, to name a few. On the other hand, hiking\
  \ in flip flops meant we\u2019d have to swim back with them, two kilometers. \n\n\
  \u201CScrew it! We\u2019ll be fine!\u201D I declare. \n\nAs we ascend Batu Kuching\
  \ barefoot, and take in our last morning in nature, the ocean conditions look a\
  \ little rougher than usual. But what better way to seal a week of volunteering\
  \ for Lang Tengah Turtle Watch than cliff jumping at sunrise? \n\nI take the thirty-foot-leap\
  \ in first, and, as soon as I surface, I\u2019m bobbing like a yoyo - we\u2019ve\
  \ totally underestimated the choppiness! \n\nDenzel, a volunteer I\u2019d met a\
  \ week earlier, tosses down our masks, snorkels and fins, before jumping in himself.\
  \ I quickly slip into my gear and give myself a pep-talk: \u201CSam, stay calm.\
  \ You\u2019ve been in crazier situations.\u201D But there\u2019s no time to focus\
  \ on myself, as Denzel is in full panic mode. While I have the wits of an adept\
  \ swimmer, Denzel does not. Kuala Lumpur-born, he\u2019s spent most of his life\
  \ in the big city.\n\nTossed by the successive swells, Denzel starts swallowing\
  \ water. I hand him his fins to stay afloat, but he insists on putting on his mask\
  \ first, so I back off. \n\nI keep an eye on his sinking fins, but they\u2019re\
  \ descending too fast and, within seconds, they\u2019re barely visible. Denzel is\
  \ so hysterical, his mask isn\u2019t even covering both nostrils! \n\nQuickly assessing\
  \ there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll be able to freedive to his fins, I take a deep\
  \ breath, and swim down fifteen meters to grab them. Thankfully I\u2019ve been practicing\
  \ my freediving, but a meters more... \n\n\u201CDenzel, put these on now,\u201D\
  \ I state firmly. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t argue, but he does struggle. I want to help,\
  \ but I leave a long arm\u2019s length between us. I\u2019d learned the hard way,\
  \ years ago when my sister almost drowned me, that a panicked person\u2019s adrenaline\
  \ puts them in Hulk mode! And if Denzel takes me down, it\u2019s sayonara! \n\n\u201C\
  Now pull your mask down onto your neck and look at me...\u201D I continue to give\
  \ commands,  \u201CWe\u2019re going to take ten deep breaths together. We\u2019\
  ll be fine. We just need to relax.\u201D \n\nWe\u2019re treading so hard though,\
  \ it\u2019s truthfully difficult to relax. I pivot strategies, \u201CFlip onto your\
  \ back, Denzel, and scissor your fins up and down. Let\u2019s just float for a minute.\u201D\
  \ And, that\u2019s how we swim the two kilometers around the point and back into\
  \ our camp\u2019s bay, alternating between swimming and floating breaks. \n\nAs\
  \ we swim, I ignore the sharks darting towards the jagged coastline, prowling for\
  \ breakfast, and focus on how peacefully the fish surrender to the ebb and flow\
  \ of each wave. When the swell pushes us hard, we let it- swimming against the current\
  \ is easier once we stop resisting.  \n\nAnd not a moment too soon, we turn the\
  \ point into the calm waters of the protected bay. Over the past week, I\u2019ve\
  \ swam every nook of this bay, so much so that I recognize all of its inhabitants.\
  \ It seems they recognize us too. The shy blowfish greets us from behind its coral\
  \ home, the nervous shoal of Big-Eyed red snapper oggle us, and the baby black tip\
  \ reef sharks patrol the area, dutifully. Frankly, I couldn\u2019t be happier to\
  \ see them! \n\nWe swim the final length to the beach, where Denzel collapses in\
  \ exhaustion. \u201CSam, thank you so much. You saved my life.\u201D\n\n\u201CGood\
  \ thing we didn\u2019t take our flip flops!,\u201D I relievingly joke, and that\u2019\
  s how I became a certifiably non certified lifeguard in Malaysia."
