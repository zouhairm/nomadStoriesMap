Text: "We are always afraid to do something, even if we really want it... Sometimes\
  \ we just imagine the perfect picture of the journey, we know how everything should\
  \ go. I realized that my love for India was superficial and idealized. I was afraid\
  \ to go there, although I really wanted it and read a lot about it. I overcame my\
  \ fear. There was a reason. It's a conference. Tickets and visa were issued so quickly\
  \ that I did not expect. And now I'm sitting on a plane. Night flight, and the plane\
  \ gets into a zone of turbulence. Nothing happened. I stepped on the land of India.\
  \ And I felt the smell of the country, which was completely different, new to me.\
  \ Early in the morning I went to campus in a rickshaw. I saw people sleeping on\
  \ the street, exotic animals, and my impressions have already begun to form. I went\
  \ into my room and saw a big lizard looking at me from the bed. And I thought it\
  \ was just the beginning. In the morning I went outside and realized that where\
  \ people go, there and cars go, cows want. Streets were so noisy that I was afraid.\
  \ I wanted to go back to my room and wait there until I left. But I changed my mind\
  \ abruptly and went on. And now I am grateful to life for those days of travel.\
  \ I feel like I'm in a whirlpool. I drove around New Delhi in a rickshaw, learned\
  \ how to bargain, ate very spicy local food, and I loved it. I was enjoying myself.\
  \ I went to Agra on a local bus with a lot of people to see my dream \u2013 Taj\
  \ Mahal. I saw how kind and religious people can be, what a bright and unique culture\
  \ of India. I fell in love with India again. Now it is for real. On the last day\
  \ of my stay, I wondered why I hadn't flown to India before and what I was afraid\
  \ of. I was afraid of change and discomfort. But these 4 days in New Delhi turned\
  \ my consciousness and understanding of life upside down. I know now that even the\
  \ smallest things can bring joy and give a smile. For example, a delicious ice cream\
  \ on the street or a monkey who stole a banana from the seller. A year passed. And\
  \ I realized that the trip to India was the best trip of all time. And I'm already\
  \ planning a new trip to India, to another state, so I could get new emotions from\
  \ my truly beloved country."
