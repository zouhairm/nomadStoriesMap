Text: "Nightfall was always early around here. Looking at lights going off at 8:30\
  \ was weird for us town folks who burn their eyes looking at their phones for an\
  \ hour before sleeping. Maybe even they are doing that. Who knows? \n\nThe Gangtok\
  \ valley was enveloped by mountain ranges, and looking at the lights of the innumerable\
  \ dwellings in the night going on and off would make you feel like countless stars\
  \ blinking beneath you. A date with a quarter of old monk rum had left me a little\
  \ buzzed. I was pondering about the countless stories that these huge looming figures\
  \ must have witnessed. That\u2019s when the phone rang. \nIt was Rakesh.\n\n \"\
  Sir, The Baba has protected us today. There was a landslide on the Nathula pass.\
  \ A number of cars are trapped.\"\nI was dumbstruck. After enquiring about his safety,\
  \ I hung up. \nI shuddered at the thought of getting stuck in a landslide with nothing\
  \ but steep hills on one side and endless abyss on the other. \nToday's events stirred\
  \ before my mind.\n\nThe road to Nathula pass was one of the most breathtakingly\
  \ beautiful and dangerous roads I have traveled on. My driver Rakesh Thapa was a\
  \ middle-aged Nepali man who was driving through the steep hairpin bends of the\
  \ mountains with unerring ease. A white Buddhist prayer bead and a small idol of\
  \ Ganesh were adorning his dashboard.\n\nOur first stop, the bewitchingly beautiful\
  \ Tsomgo Lake was formed of water melted from the ice of the surrounding mountains.\n\
  \nI made the vain resolution that someday I would come back and live here.\n\nA\
  \ tap on my shoulders disrupted my musings. It was Rakesh\n.\n\"Sir, we need to\
  \ leave now, it becomes risky to drive on this road after dark\"\n\n\"Yet knowing\
  \ how way leads on to way,\nI doubted if I should ever come back.\u201D\n\nReluctantly\
  \ I returned to the car. After all, seeing the Nathula pass, the historic silk route\
  \ going through the Sino-Indian border is what I had been excited about. \nBut there\
  \ was another stop. \n\nBaba Mandir was a shrine built in the honour of the late\
  \ Harbhajan Singh, a dedicated army officer who died in an accident. It is believed\
  \ that his spirit still goes on patrols and warns the army of any impending attacks.\n\
  \nBeing an agnostic, I wasn't too interested in it. But the shrine was a must stop\
  \ for all cars going towards Nathula.  Even army convoys would convey quick prayers\
  \ before driving off towards the border.\n\nI went into the temple and observed\
  \ the neatly kept uniform and shoes of the dead soldier. I had to admit, it was\
  \ kind of intriguing looking at a dead man's clothes. Apparently one would find\
  \ crumpled bed sheets in the morning and mud stains on his shoes in the evening.\n\
  \n\"Yeah right!\" I chuckled and retraced my steps towards the car. Rakesh's head\
  \ had disappeared into the bonnet.\n\"Looks like the spark plug's burnt!\" \n\n\
  I was vexed but there was no alternative other than waiting. However, things weren't\
  \ that simple. First, the car would rev a bit, slowly the growling of the engine\
  \ grew weaker until it gave a final few coughs and died. Now we were in a soup.\
  \ It was already late. The problem at hand wasn't going to Nathula. \n\nIt was going\
  \ back to Gangtok.\n\nSurprisingly that was arranged without much fuss. One of Rakesh's\
  \ friends agreed to give me a lift back to Gangtok. It was already late afternoon\
  \ and the erratic mountain weather had started showing it's true colours. The bright\
  \ morning sun had taken refuge behind a horde of dark clouds. It was already drizzling\
  \ by the time we passed Tsomgo. It was raining heavily by the time we reached Gangtok.\n\
  \nMonths later, when I would recall the incident, it would seem pretty distant,\
  \ like looking at something from the wrong end of a telescope.\n\nBut for today,\
  \ I decided to believe that the mountains have their own truth. Maybe it was all\
  \ just a coincidence. But I choose to believe that I was saved by a guardian angel.\
  \ I came to Gangtok looking for a respite from my mundane life.\n\nInstead, I found\
  \ faith."
