Text: "I\u2019ve been restless since we landed at Haneda. It\u2019s just that time\
  \ of the month.\n\nI thanked Rina, my travel mate, for choosing this resort. It\
  \ was heaven for when you need time for yourself, to reflect, to be at ease with\
  \ your thoughts. This place is so different from Tokyo, even though located just\
  \ an hour away. Lines of almost barren trees were visible at every directions. Wooden\
  \ cabins and establishments disguised themselves, merged with their surrounding.\
  \ No winds, no busy traffics, no sounds of rustling leaves, no chattering, no people,\
  \ there were just our footsteps and our laughs for when we realized cold doesn\u2019\
  t always come from the wind, it\u2019s also caused by below zero temperature.\n\n\
  While I could distract myself from the cramps by our activities this past few days,\
  \ my mood swing was persistent and we both know that at some point we should part\
  \ way before ruining our friendship. Key for travelling with close friend is to\
  \ know our own limit and to be ready for a time-out from each other. The opportunity\
  \ came after Rina decided that we\u2019re lost, that we wouldn\u2019t be able to\
  \ find the Stone Church we came for, and it\u2019s time for her hot spring bath\
  \ which I, of course, couldn\u2019t join. I didn\u2019t want to turn the onsen into\
  \ a murder scene, did I?\n\nWe separated at the bus stop, she walked toward the\
  \ onsen and I stepped toward the Harunire Terrace where I could find cafes and restaurants\
  \ while waiting for her and the shuttle bus. But the smells of hot cofffee and the\
  \ sight of books at Maruyama Cafe couldn\u2019t calm me down. I stepped out again,\
  \ left a lingering bell chimes at the door.\n\nI retraced our steps. Read every\
  \ signs more closely untill I found a stone path we didn\u2019t take before. By\
  \ the edge of the parking lot, I saw it: The Stone Church. Stood grandly with its\
  \ grim walls. At this dim end-of-winter light, it\u2019s easy to miss the church\
  \ for its resemblance to the surrounding and for its quirky design and for no apparent\
  \ view of any crosses. I hastily walked up to the glass door, reached the handle,\
  \ almost pushed it when I startled for someone already pulled it for me.\n\nI froze.\
  \ A sister stood in front of me. I panicked. I lost words. Then, in a doubtful tone\
  \ of my limited Japanese vocabulary I asked, \u201CIs it okay?\u201D I pointed at\
  \ my head. What I really meant was, \u201CAm I okay?\u201D\n\nThere we were, at\
  \ the enctrance of a church, two women, both showing only limited skins and hairs.\
  \ She\u2019s in her habit and I was in my hijab. For a moment, I caught myself thinking\
  \ about national cathedral and mosque in my country that had been built side by\
  \ side, face to face, to encourage unity in diversity. \n\nThe sister smiled, nodded,\
  \ and told me not to take any photography while gesturing to the sign behind her\
  \ which said the same thing.\n\nI entered the main hall to find myself to be a lone\
  \ visitor. It felt different from my countless stops to Hindu\u2019s temples from\
  \ when I still lived in Bali, also different from my trips to Buddhist\u2019s pagodas\
  \ in Jogjakarta, and certainly different from the Shinto\u2019s shrines I came to\
  \ here in Tokyo. This place, felt sacred. Probably because it\u2019s my first visit\
  \ to any church and at this moment this church is mine and mine alone. Not only\
  \ that, I realised my faith came from the same roots. We shared histories.\n\nExcitement\
  \ and serenity flooded my senses.\n\nJust like its name, the walls, floor, and ceiling\
  \ were made of stones. Lights peeked from the giant window behind the altar and\
  \ from the glass insertions at the ceiling. Vines draped down at certain part of\
  \ the walls. Water audibly trickled at the man-made stream. I brought myself to\
  \ walk down the aisle and sit at the second row of wooden bench at my left-hand\
  \ side, reading the inscriptions at the wall and stairs:\n\nOur father in heaven,\n\
  Hallowed be thy name,\nThy kingdom come,\nThy will be done.\n\nAnd I, finally, at\
  \ peace."
