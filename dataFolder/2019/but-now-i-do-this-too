Text: "The question is asked out of suppressed desperation. \u201CSo, when did you\
  \ first start to sail?\u201D Facing the ocean on a high-placed bench that allows\
  \ me to rest my feet on the railing, I turn to the leather-faced employee on the\
  \ small boat. I am in urgent need of distraction - if I spend one more minute looking\
  \ into the moving mountains of water surrounding me, I will surely panic. Rather\
  \ than thinking of how just one misplaced wave might throw me overboard, I throw\
  \ myself into a conversation that will prove to be symptomatic for my many Portuguese\
  \ encounters to come.\n\u201CWhen I was very small,\u201D he answers with a thick\
  \ accent and a grin, as I quickly have to grip a firmer hold of the back of the\
  \ bench due to a larger wave.\n\u201CI am a fisher, really. On the other side of\
  \ the island we catch the fish served in the best restaurants around the world,\u201D\
  \ he says and points to Berlengas, the cliffs peeking up from this fringe of the\
  \ atlantic sea. \u201CBut now I do this too,\u201D he says and gestures towards\
  \ the lot of us, at least 5 different nationalities cramped together under a beautiful\
  \ and tall sky.\nJust like the fisherman, not one of the people I met working in\
  \ the tourist industry seemed to have been doing it for very long. There was a distinctive\
  \ before and after. They all used to have other livelihoods, but as the number of\
  \ tourists kept growing, they had joined the movement and nothing was really the\
  \ same anymore. Portugal was elaborate and brand new to me, just the exotic outskirt\
  \ of Europe, which I had travelled several weeks by train to reach. But what I did\
  \ not expect to find was a sort of weariness hovering over it all. Most people were\
  \ benefiting financially from the tourist boom, but the people I met had a certain\
  \ sadness to them, a sort of nostalgia, really, relaying the fact that everything\
  \ comes at a cost. One of these people was Hugo. \n\nDirected by this charming walking\
  \ tour guide in his late 20\u2019s, I was led through the winding streets of Alfama,\
  \ the oldest part of Lisboa. He talked about his grandmother, who as a young woman\
  \ used to lead even the most intimate conversations by leaning out the window and\
  \ yelling to her friend living across the square. Nothing was private and nothing\
  \ held back in the open spaces between houses dressed in tiles. I now wonder if\
  \ not every tour guide shared that same grandmother, but as Hugo went on to talk\
  \ about the atmosphere of Lisboa, he kindly revealed his more unpolished self to\
  \ us. \n\u201CIn this city people are friendly,\u201D Hugo gesticulated as he spoke,\
  \ and he carefully locked eyes with each of us in turn, \u201Cwe care about each\
  \ other and though Lisboa is a large city, it often feels like many small villages.\u201D\
  \ He then came to a halt and his body language abruptly paused. \u201CBut things\
  \ have changed these past few years,\u201D he added. \nHugo was right. His country\
  \ was undergoing massive changes, and people like myself would automatically alter\
  \ the places we went, simply by being there. He knew that. Like Anna, a tuk tuk\
  \ driver/ music guide/ former teacher with whom I shared a beer in a cramped Fardo\
  \ bar, the fisherman, and so many more of his countrymen, Hugo earned his living\
  \ off tourism. He walked the streets like he was working his dream job. But at that\
  \ moment, as his whole being seemed to pause, it was as if he accidentally remembered\
  \ and understood the ugly truth; that sharing the marvelous places he loved and\
  \ knew also meant changing them. And, ultimately, that it might mean playing a part\
  \ in their gold-plated destruction."
