Text: "My homestay was in the mountainous region of Pecs, a Hungarian city just an\
  \ hour\u2019s train ride from Budapest. The cool, moist air allowed for an energizing\
  \ start to the day, which I knew would be necessary given the full-time teaching\
  \ position I\u2019d taken on. After a light breakfast of toast and an apple, and\
  \ my host family walked me down the long driveway to show me to the bus stop on\
  \ the main road. \n\nThe bus ride into the center of town took about twenty minutes\
  \ and allowed time for the coffee to set in as well as time to completely overthink\
  \ my first day of teaching. My stop is coming up: Aradi vertanuk utja. At least,\
  \ I think that\u2019s what they said \u2013 the bus was loud and I wasn\u2019t completely\
  \ familiar with the language. I hopped off anyway and looked for the community center\
  \ where I would teach: Baranya Megyei Onkentes Centrum. Instead, I saw a Turkish-age\
  \ mosque and a Gothic-style cathedral across the street from each other, already\
  \ beginning to tell the story of the long, sometimes brutal, and always interesting\
  \ history of the Hungarian region. \n\nI then noticed a man on the corner selling\
  \ flowers. He waved excitedly to me:\n\n\tSzia!, he said (hello!, he said)\n\n\t\
  Szia, jo napot!, I responded (hello, good morning!, I responded)\n\nI walked about\
  \ three more blocks to the community center where I began my journey. I was pointed\
  \ in the direction of my classroom, where I\u2019d meet my students for the first\
  \ time. I took a breath and entered the room.\n\n--\n\nI woke up at 6 o'clock sharp.\
  \ I promised my host mother, Bubu, that I\u2019d make her French toast for breakfast\
  \ on my last day in Pecs. After we ate, I headed down the long driveway to the bus\
  \ stop on the main road. \n\nThe bus ride into the center of town took about twenty\
  \ minutes and allowed time for the coffee to set in and to contemplate the day\u2019\
  s lesson plan. As we drive past the Turquoise-topped mosque and cathedral, I know\
  \ my stop is coming up. I step off. I\u2019m still in Pecs, but the nostalgia is\
  \ already kicking in. I look for my flower-selling friend in his trusty spot. \n\
  \n\tSzia-szia, puszi!, he said (hello friend, kiss on the cheek!, he said)\n\n\t\
  Szia-szia, k\xF6sz\xF6n\xF6m, I responded (hello, friend, thank you, I responded)\n\
  \nHe handed me a sunflower.\n\n\tNincs mit, szia, he said (don\u2019t mention it.\
  \ until next time.)\n\nI do not know the name of the man who sold flowers, but of\
  \ the months I spent in Hungary, it\u2019s always the flower man by the bus stop\
  \ that I mention in the stories of my time in Pecs. Each day, he sparked a sense\
  \ of belonging, of kindness, in a town that could have easily felt lonely and isolating.\
  \ Travel is not always about big, bold adventures, but rather is often an opportunity\
  \ to recognize the unity in the world, and solidarity between members of humankind."
