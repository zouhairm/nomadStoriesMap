Text: 'In March of 2016, I had the opportunity of a lifetime: studying abroad in Hamburg,
  Germany for a month!  While I was overwhelmed with excitement, I was also nervous
  since I was only 17 years old and this would be my first time traveling alone.  When
  I arrived, I was in awe of the culture, food, and beauty of the country.  Hamburg
  itself is unique, with distinct districts each with a flair of their own.  I was
  fortunate enough to have a host family to show me around the city.  While I was
  homesick at first, this ''leap into the unknown'' quickly became a type of adrenaline
  rush for me.  I loved exploring the city for myself with no set plan.  I find that
  these are the times when you stumble upon the greatest highlights of a trip.  This
  experience also taught me about the importance of connecting with the locals.  Even
  just learning a couple of words goes such a long way and shows an appreciation for
  culture and a desire to ''dive in'' rather than ''navigating'' through cultural
  differences.  This was one of the greatest and most daunting opportunities that
  I have faced thus far, and I would do it again in an instant.  Traveling is an experience
  that is of greater value than any material things, and the feeling of creating memories
  in a place that becomes so special cannot be beaten.'
