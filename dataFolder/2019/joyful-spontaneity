Text: "I didn\u2019t realize I had a slight aversion to adventure until I had to have\
  \ one.\n\u201CIt doesn\u2019t say what time it arrives,\u201D Hannah said, the little\
  \ crease appearing between her eyebrows. \n\u201CAnd do we need to buy tickets or\
  \ do they take coin?\u201D Tenea asked.\nIn March 2017, I traveled to Florence,\
  \ Italy to visit my best friend, Hannah, who studied abroad for a semester. I was\
  \ dying to go; the mere thought of \u201CFlorence\u201D made me vibrate with joy.\
  \ For one whole week, I would get to spend time with Hannah, and my other, dear\
  \ friend, Tenea, eating and laughing our way through one of the most beautiful cities\
  \ in the world.  \nAll of sudden, moving alarmingly fast, an electric blue rectangle\
  \ dashed to the curb. In bright neon red, Pratolino 2A registered in my retinas.\
  \ I jumped up so quickly I almost scared Tenea off the bench. \n\u201CThere! Shit!\
  \ Runrunrunrunrun!\u201D\nIn our best dresses, we fluttered across the street and\
  \ jumped on the bus.\nI was still so anxious, though. I was afraid of getting lost.\
  \ Of being pick-pocketed or stranded thousands of miles from home. My anxieties\
  \ would always try to keep me from having fun or relaxing, and I had such a paralyzing\
  \ fear of doing anything that would risk consequence, I could hardly leave Hannah\u2019\
  s apartment the first day I was in Florence. \nBut I was on a mission. Scrolling\
  \ through Pinterest months before to find what to-do in Italy, I found him. Colossus.\
  \ A massive, 16th century statue of a man hanging over a lake in the countryside,\
  \ with rooms hidden inside. Colossus was in Pratolino, though, not Florence. Which\
  \ only increased my anxiety.\nWe jumped into the sun\u2014so warm, I could feel\
  \ new freckles jumping up on my skin by the second\u2014and did a few ballerina\
  \ twirls trying to figure out where to go. A hand-painted sign that read \u201C\
  Parco Villa Demidoff\u201D pointed us down a hill that looked like it led to something\
  \ from Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Hannah let out a shriek of delight.\n\u201C\
  Let\u2019s go!\u201D \nWe went skipping down the hill and booked it across the street\
  \ to the park. A security guard in a down coat came out.\n\u201CChiuso, chiuso.\u201D\
  \  Closed, closed.\nI deflated.  He handed me a brochure for the park and tapped\
  \ one line several times. \u201COpen from April to October.\u201D\n\u201CNo!\u201D\
  \ Hannah cried out. \n\u201COh Katie, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201D Tenea said, rubbing\
  \ my arm.\nI smiled, wiggling my nose to fight off the new tingling sensation there.\n\
  \u201CGuess we might as well go,\u201D I muttered.\n\u201CActually,\u201D Hannah\
  \ jumped in. \u201CI saw a church on top of the hill. We have to go.\u201D\nI gave\
  \ her the nicest stink eye I could. She smiled at me. \n\u201CI have a good feeling\
  \ about this.\nI begged my anxiety to just let me have this and walked.\nWe were\
  \ quiet most of the time, because to talk felt like disturbing the entire town.\
  \ Pratolino was the complete opposite of Florence: quiet, full of trees and fresh\
  \ air. The kind of place that makes you think at every turn.\nThe church was locked\
  \ but a door in the fence held shut against the wind by a bungee cord caught our\
  \ eyes. We wandered through it and walked into the most beautiful cemetery I\u2019\
  ve ever seen. I was perplexed. Golden yellow, magenta, and baby boy blue, glowing\
  \ against white granite. It was windy walking up, but here, everything held still.\
  \ Photos of the departed\u2014some black and white and faded, other on glossy paper\
  \ in color\u2014looked up at us.\n\u201CWhat\u2019s back there?\u201D Tenea said,\
  \ standing on top toe to peak over the fence. \nI nudged our way through another\
  \ door. We gasped. We couldn\u2019t not gasp. It was a meadow, bathed in God light\
  \ and tickled by purple crocuses. Deer jumped the creek nearby.\n\u201CGood thing\
  \ we didn\u2019t turn around before,\u201D I grinned.\nWe sat in the meadow, writing\
  \ and feeling the sun on our legs until we could hear our stomachs over the wind.\
  \ We made our way back down the hill to the only restaurant in town. I was so at\
  \ peace and so happy."
