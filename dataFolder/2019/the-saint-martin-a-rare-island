Text: "There is a quote in English, \"Beautiful things do not ask for attention.\"\
  \ Saint Martin is such an island. St. Martin's is a small island (area only 8 km2)\
  \ in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, about 9 km south of the tip of\
  \ the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf peninsula, and forming the southernmost part of Bangladesh.\
  \ There is a small adjoining island that is separated at high tide, called Chera\
  \ Dwip.\nThe first settlement started 250 years ago by Arabian sailors who named\
  \ the island 'Jazeera'. During British occupation the island was named St. Martin\
  \ Island. The local names of the island are \"Narikel jinjira\" which means 'Coconut\
  \ Island' in Bengali, and \"Daruchini Dwip\" which means \"Cinnamon island\" in\
  \ Bengali. It is the only coral island in Bangladesh. \nLast year I traveled this\
  \ island with some of my friends. We started our journey at 11.30pm from Chittagong,\
  \ Bangladesh by bus and check out from the bus at 6.00am at Teknaf. Then we ate\
  \ our breakfast and went to the ship in Teknaf Ship Ghat. The only way to reach\
  \ St. Martin's Island is by water transportation: boats and ships. The ship started\
  \ at 9.00am and reached at St. Martin at 12.00pm. Then we check in the Hotel and\
  \ had lunch. Then we went to the sea beach. St Martin's is a tropical clich\xE9\
  \ and the only coral island in Bangladesh, with beaches fringed with coconut palms\
  \ and laid-back locals. It's a clean and peaceful place with nothing more strenuous\
  \ to do than soak up the rays \u2014 even mosquitoes are a rarity. There's a naval\
  \ base near the center of the island, and the USA looked into setting up one of\
  \ their own a few years back.\nIt is possible to walk around St Martin's in a day\
  \ but we stay there a night. Stars are also amazingly plentiful on a moonless night,\
  \ due to the lack of electricity on the island. That was moonlight night so everything\
  \ was so charming. Sunrise on the east side of the island, and after a lazy day\
  \ head over to the west side for sunset. Sunset Point is a rocky peninsula on the\
  \ northwest corner of the island, near Saint Martin's Resort, which exists only\
  \ at low tide \u2014 a popular spot if sunset and low tide coincide.\nThere are\
  \ many small shops near the dock/port and along the main road selling very basic\
  \ necessities and the odd souvenir t-shirts, hats, dry fish, shoe, sandals, dry\
  \ foods, cosmetics & toiletries and sunglasses and many more. These are relatively\
  \ cheap from the main town. Especially one must buy dry fish from here, it's relatively\
  \ cheap and high quality. There are also few restaurants along with the main road\
  \ of Saint Martins Island. The foods are cheap and good quality to eat. Anyone can\
  \ complete the Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner with various plates of seafood. Everyone\
  \ should taste the experience with different sea fishes and food if once go there.\
  \ Food is a little more expensive here than on the mainland. The food shacks that\
  \ line the road to the port all cook up similar fare: parothas (Tk 8), omelets (egg,\
  \ Tk 20) and vegetable curry (Tk 20) for breakfast, and (fish, dal, rice, and veggies\
  \ at 130 Tk) the rest of the day. Cha is Tk 8. \"Narikel Jinjira Restaurant\" is\
  \ simply the best of the best. We have all heard about \"A room with a view\" but\
  \ at Narikel Jinjira Restaurant they say \"Dine with a view\". The restaurant is\
  \ located right at the front of the pier. Coming down from the pier you will find\
  \ the restaurant on the first right side. They specialize in Seafood as well as\
  \ Bangla, Indian and Chinese. Bar-B-Que is one of the special features they have\
  \ for late afternoon. \nNext day at 11.00am we check out from the hotel and get\
  \ in ship at 2.00pm after lunch. Then we come back to Chittagong. Overall it was\
  \ a great travel."
