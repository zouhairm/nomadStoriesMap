Text: "What is it about a place that captures the hearts of travellers? For many,\
  \ it could the awe-inspiring scenery; for others, perhaps, centuries-old history\
  \ that whisper of ancient kingdoms, fallen empires, and folklores of the past. The\
  \ reasons run the gamut. Everyday in every corner of the globe, a traveller steps\
  \ foot in a new city, town or village and falls hopelessly under its spell like\
  \ a scene straight out of a fairytale. \n\nMy love affair with Istanbul was not\
  \ quite as clear-cut. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint how exactly the city got under\
  \ my skin. Sure, every travel guide book will breathlessly list down the many charms\
  \ of Istanbul: sprawling mosques; bustling bazaars that tickle and tantalise all\
  \ five senses; an East-meets-West sensibility that no other place on Earth can lay\
  \ claim to...the list goes on (and on). But in my case, it goes beyond all that\
  \ \u2013 an intangible yet undeniable thread that ties me to Istanbul. \n\nWhat\
  \ is it about this city that has captured the heart of this traveller? 11 years\
  \ has passed since I first step foot in Istanbul one brisk winter\u2019s morning\
  \ in 2008. 11 years, 5 trips, and countless cups of \xE7ay later, I\u2019ve only\
  \ begun to slowly unravel this mystery. D\xE9j\xE0 vu: a sense of familiarity towards\
  \ a city that was previously unknown to me. How can place so foreign feel so intimate?\
  \ I\u2019ve never believed in the concept of past lives or reincarnation but it\
  \ is possible that in another lifetime, I called Istanbul my home.    \n\nWe travel\
  \ to escape, usually from the drudgery of our daily lives: a dead-end job, unfulfilling\
  \ relationships or the sense of restlessness from knowing that where you come from\
  \ isn\u2019t where you really belong. That\u2019s why I escape \u2013 jetting from\
  \ country to country in search of that elusive sense of belonging. Many times I\u2019\
  ve tried and failed but to quote a wise woman: \u201CIt takes but one person, one\
  \ moment, one conviction, to start a ripple of change.\u201D In my case, it took\
  \ one city to make me feel finally at ease again. \n\nThe travel guide books aren\u2019\
  t wrong. Istanbul has so much to offer to its lucky visitors. But for me, what I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect to find there was home."
