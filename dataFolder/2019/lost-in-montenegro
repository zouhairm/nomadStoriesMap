Text: "When I set off for my trip on 28 May 2017, my mother wouldn't let me board\
  \ my plane without making me promise her - for maybe the 100th time that day - that\
  \ I'd be careful and not do anything stupid. Two months later I was being driven\
  \ through the dark mountains of Montenegro in the middle of the night by two German\
  \ girls I had just met, not knowing at the time where we were nor where we were\
  \ going. \n\nThis all took place around the tail-end of what was supposed to be\
  \ a three-month long whirlwind backpacking adventure through Europe, accompanied\
  \ by my friend Rebecca. I had flown from LAX to Dublin and had about a week exploring\
  \ Ireland and Scotland before I met up with her in London. From there, we raced\
  \ our way through all those classic cities subject to every American wanderlust's\
  \ fantasies: Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Krakow, and Athens to name a few,\
  \ and even did a more audacious side-trip to Chernobyl in Ukraine. \n\nIn any case,\
  \ Rebecca and I's journey quickly took us to Skopje, North Macedonia, where we we\
  \ just so happened to be sharing a hostel room with two extremely friendly and outgoing\
  \ German girls who not only had the same itinerary, but also a car! I began talking\
  \ and tried to hint as subtly as I can that we were in need of a way to Lake Ohrid,\
  \ and maybe beyond. To my delight, they said yes, and I rushed to tell Rebecca.\
  \ The more level-headed of us, she was more wary than I about hitching a ride with\
  \ two girls we had never met before. Somehow I managed to convince her that it was\
  \ a good idea, so a few hours later we hopped in their car and left Skopje, and\
  \ after an eventful two days we were ready to leave Ohrid as well.\n\nWe drove through\
  \ Albania where we had a harrowing experience of a group of burly men shining their\
  \ lasers at us at a petrol station in the middle of nowhere. Perhaps it was that\
  \ experience that put us all on edge, but it didn't make our next experience better.\n\
  \nIt was nearing 11 PM and we were now somewhere in Montenegro. It was pitch-black\
  \ outside; the only indication of light being from the car itself. The narrow dirt\
  \ road we drove on snaked alongside the mountain, the looming knowledge that a couple-hundred\
  \ meters fall awaited us should we drift ever so slightly to our left. It didn't\
  \ help that the villages we drove by look like they came straight from the set of\
  \ a horror movie. We laughed at our situation, but there was a sense of nervousness\
  \ behind all our jokes of being kidnapped by a cult or something similarly outlandish.\
  \ I thought about what my mother would say if she were to see the situation I got\
  \ myself into, and couldn't help but laugh.\n\nThe jokes and laughter soon stopped\
  \ as we realized that even if we got down the mountain, we still had nowhere to\
  \ stay. It wasn't until a little after midnight when we hit the first major city\
  \ in hours; Nik\u0161i\u0107. We got reception and realized it was only another\
  \ hour until Risan, which is a town near Kotor, our next main destination. So we\
  \ made that journey and arrived around 1 AM. To our surprise there was still a restaurant\
  \ open with people inside! Alicia, being the extrovert she is, immediately marched\
  \ to it and unabashedly began asking people if they spoke English and could get\
  \ us accommodation. I stood back, believing it was no use.\n\nMiraculously, the\
  \ restaurant said he also owned an AirBnB just a little bit up the alley-way, and\
  \ that it was available for the night. I couldn't believe our luck as he handed\
  \ us the keys. After saying \"hvala\" to him a million times, we trudged to the\
  \ flat and dropped all our things on the floor. The four of us didn't speak much\
  \ as we settled into our rooms, ready to fall asleep so we could wake up the next\
  \ morning refreshed for a new adventure."
