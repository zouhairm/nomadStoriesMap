Text: "Days before traveling to Buenos Aires, Argentina, I already had all my travel\
  \ planning ready. Nothing could go wrong as it was my first international trip alone.\
  \ It was necessary to know how to get around the city, what to see, what to eat,\
  \ how much to pay in tourist attractions... I thought everything would go according\
  \ to the plan, but it was not, fortunately. I came across places, sensations, emotions,\
  \ and palates that I did not expect to find, even knowing in advance what I would\
  \ do.\n\nEmbarking on the air-time machine, I gained a small alfajor whose shape\
  \ I had never seen: it was not covered with chocolate like the ones I knew. I expected\
  \ to eat something on the plane, but I did not expect to eat an alfajor in the early\
  \ hours of the trip and still read about its history in a magazine. This food symbol\
  \ of Argentina was present in all the ten days of my trip. Every day I tasted a\
  \ different alfajor and all of them were good. That may sound clich\xE9, but it\
  \ was indeed.\n\nStill talking about food, I expected to taste the famous Argentinean\
  \ dulce de leche, but I did not expect to eat it on a loaf of bread during breakfast.\
  \ I devoured the dulce de leche with bread, in the alfajor, in a small bocadito\
  \ covered with chocolate, along with coffee and, more than once, I still had a refresh\
  \ with the ice cream of dulce de leche, that made me want to live in that city in\
  \ every lick.\n\nWalking through the streets of Buenos Aires I observed the people,\
  \ the places, the food in the shop windows, I took pictures, selfies ... I hoped\
  \ for that, but I did not imagine that I would fall in love with the visual composition\
  \ of the streets and the architecture of the old part of the city. I preferred to\
  \ walk for an hour instead of arriving at my destination in 20 minutes taking a\
  \ subway. I scoured the big streets, like Avenida 9 de Julio, and discovered the\
  \ small streets and alleys of the neighborhoods. On each walk, I founded one of\
  \ the places I wanted to see. In each walk, I discovered a new place I did not expect\
  \ to find.\n\nIn El Rosedal, I expected to find roses, but I did not imagine that\
  \ I would burst into tears at the visual fragrance of that sea of colored roses\
  \ in the middle of spring. I expected to shiver in the Recoleta Cemetery, but I\
  \ did not imagine that I would be moved by the tomb of Evita Per\xF3n, full of homage\
  \ and roses. I had planned to take a boat trip on the Rio Tigre, but I could never\
  \ know that I would find houses hidden along its banks, where family stories had\
  \ happened. I knew that La Boca was a colorful neighborhood and I expected this\
  \ visual saturation, but I did not know that I would also face an immense social\
  \ contrast. Having known France years before, I did not believe that Buenos Aires\
  \ was the Paris of the Americas, but when I went out on the streets at night I could\
  \ see the lights of the city gaining form in front of my eyes, bringing back memories\
  \ of the Parisian lights.\n\nI expected a thousand things from Buenos Aires. I came\
  \ across with many of these hopes, but what struck me the most were the city's parks,\
  \ from the smallest to the largest. No one had talked about the parks in travel\
  \ reports or videos about what to do in the Argentine capital. In the parks, where\
  \ leisure and rest are mixed, I lay down, slept a little, ate meals, watched the\
  \ time pass, watched the people interacting, couples kissing, people running, dogs\
  \ walking ... On the grasses of these countless parks, I thought about myself and\
  \ connected with my inner self, with the sensations and emotions of being alone\
  \ in a foreign country without knowing anyone.\n\nOn the flight back home, I find\
  \ myself making plans to learn Spanish, make empanadas and return to Buenos Aires,\
  \ whether alone or with others."
