Text: "The trip I want to talk about takes place in France however, that is not where\
  \ it began. The idea of traveling had always been interesting but I never knew it\
  \ was possible. A mission trip to Belize had left me wanting more but I was unsure\
  \ how to get there. I decided I would head back to Belize. Partly to acquire credits\
  \ for a class I was taking, partly to get back to the place that had called me to\
  \ missions, and partly to get away from the norm of life in hopes to find how my\
  \ life would move forward. While in Belize my taxi driver made an interesting observation.\
  \ He told me how he thought the cruise industry was not good for Belizean tourism.\
  \ He explained how tourists come in from an American ship, expecting American culture,\
  \ finding a third world country, and leave never having experienced the true beauty\
  \ that lies within the Belizean culture. I began to examine my own willingness to\
  \ let go of my American ideals and accept Belize on its own and not as a comparison\
  \ to my life at home. \n\nEnter France. France was not my first choice of travel\
  \ destinations. I had a few other trips higher up on my bucket list but as I looked\
  \ for ways to get to those places France refused to leave my mind. I went so far\
  \ as to find myself in Disney\u2019s Epcot in the France pavilion looking for flights\
  \ to Paris. It so happened I found a $500 flight to Paris while sitting there and\
  \ impulsively purchased it. A week later I had booked all hostels and train tickets\
  \ and was set for an 18 day trip through France. \n\nLyon was the beginning of my\
  \ next life lesson. While taking a food tour I learned about the passion of the\
  \ patisseries, the talents of the bakers, and the determination of the shop owners.\
  \ As we tasted each dish we learned about every ingredient, why it tasted the way\
  \ it did and why it was important to the culture of Lyon. It was so important that\
  \ we didn\u2019t simply eat the food but that we were immersed in an experience\
  \ where food was our catalyst. \n\nMy next stop took me to Geneva Switzerland. I\
  \ made the last minute decision to cross the Alps and go on a chocolate tour. Here,\
  \ chocolate was no longer a simple sweet to eat after dinner. It was an extremely\
  \ complex science. We were told to slow down, smell the chocolate, hear it snap\
  \ in half, and let it sit in our mouth as each flavor and complexity made itself\
  \ present. With the complex flavors, textures, and scents, chocolate became one\
  \ of the most interesting foods I had eaten. \n\nBordeaux proved no different. A\
  \ winery tour explained the complexity of mixing the different grapes to create\
  \ a wine that was unique and interesting. We smelled wine, saw the colors, and finally\
  \ tasted the wine providing a full sensory experience that was unlike any other\
  \ wine tasting I had ever encountered.\n\nFinally I found myself back in Paris.\
  \ I took yet another food tour. We encountered bakers, shop owners, butchers, and\
  \ chocolatiers each one an expert at their craft. After shopping like a Parisian\
  \ we stopped for dinner. Our guide prepared and explained each cheese, meet, glass\
  \ of wine and piece of bread in a way that made me believe I had never actually\
  \ encountered food before.  The greatness of this trip was not limited to food.\
  \ The lesson was taught through nourishment but carried so much more weight. This\
  \ lesson was about life in general. It taught me that life was not meant to be lived,\
  \ but experienced. Just as wine and chocolate became so much more complex when slowed\
  \ down and intentionally experienced so life. When we are intentional about seeing\
  \ all life has to offer we can fully live the way we are meant to live. Travel isn\u2019\
  t about seeing a new place but about experiencing the world from such a new perspective\
  \ that it changes how we see our selves, others, and every day."
