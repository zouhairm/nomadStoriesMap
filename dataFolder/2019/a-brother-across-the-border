Text: "\u201CHey you, you, and you, get out of my class and don\u2019t return after\
  \ four weeks.\u201D\nThe Sun wore its fiercest look on that day as it made me regret\
  \ rubbing lotion before leaving home. \u201CI\u2019ve never enjoyed French classes\
  \ anyways.\u201D I scoffed within me, feigning a sorry look as I strolled happily\
  \ out of the dilapidated classroom.\nI didn\u2019t look back but I was sure my classmates\
  \ felt sorry for me.\n\n\u201CThe three of you will regret ever taking this subject\
  \ for granted.\u201D Mrs Ola grunted as her voice echoed like a displeased father\
  \ laying a curse on his only child. The silence which followed earned her statement\
  \ more relevance. Combining this with the sound of our footsteps made it seem as\
  \ though it would come to pass.\nWell, it almost did after 15 years and 25 blog\
  \ posts when I embarked on my first international solo trip as a travel blogger.\
  \ I found myself at Seme, one of Africa\u2019s most popular land borders. With sweat\
  \ trickling slowly from my armpit, I joined multitudes of other foot travelers as\
  \ we made the long walk from the Nigerian side of the border via the illegal route\
  \ under the scorching Sun.\n\nI did all I could to recollect some basic French words\
  \ I had learned few minutes before via the internet but gave up when I couldn\u2019\
  t tell which came first between \u2018neuf and \u2018sept. This got me even more\
  \ terrified.\n\nGoing back to Nigeria will make no sense because I had set my social\
  \ media timeline agog with the news of my proposed trip to Benin Republic. It was\
  \ only logical that I continued into this land where I knew no one. \u201CI can\u2019\
  t disappoint my readers\u201D I whispered, as I changed 30,000 Naira to 49,000 Cefa.\n\
  With a straight face masking my fears, I made it to the rusty gate separating the\
  \ two countries towards a bike park where riders were on a standby to take travelers\
  \ to the country\u2019s capital. I barely noticed the beggars lined beside the gate\
  \ as they pulled my shorts with the hope of getting something.\n\nI eventually joined\
  \ the first bike on my left\_which already had a male passenger, so I sat behind\
  \ him. \"Cotonou na 200 Cefa\" the rider told us in a manner which revealed he\u2019\
  s said that a billion times during his stint as a bike rider. He kicked the bike\
  \ to life before either of us could even haggle.\nThe tyres seemed to have a deeper\
  \ relationship with the Asphalt as we arrived Cotonou way earlier than the money\
  \ changer had hinted me at the border.\n\nOn Alighting, I figured my co-passenger\
  \ didn't have exactly 200 Cefa, so I offered to pay for him. \"Merci\", he managed\
  \ to say, still dumbfounded as to why a total stranger will pay his fare.\nAs if\
  \ waiting for the biker to leave us, he asked, \"are you Nigerian?\", to which I\
  \ nodded in affirmation. \"Well, my name is Peacemaker, a final year student in\
  \ one of the universities here in Benin and I usually work as a translator and tour\
  \ guard when on break\u2026\u201D He stretched forth his hand for a handshake.\n\
  Peacemaker has never had a Nigerian friend all his life. I on the other hand needed\
  \ a saviour in the strange land of Benin where I could barely say a word in their\
  \ language! \u201CHope you wouldn\u2019t mind me showing you around?\u201D he said\
  \ cheerfully.\n\nAfter 7 different home-made meals, 6 tourist destinations, dozens\
  \ of street pictures and 8 introductions, Peacemaker bade me goodbye. He fought\
  \ gallantly to keep back his tears, but his eyes betrayed him. He tried saying a\
  \ few more words but his lips were too heavy. He gave up and simply waved. In no\
  \ time the smoke from the exhaust enveloped him, forcing me to squint before seeing\
  \ he hadn't moved any inch. \n\nAlone with my thoughts while riding back to Nigeria\
  \ in a rickety 14-sitter bus wearing one of Peacemaker\u2019s shirts, I chuckled\
  \ again at the words of Mrs Ola. I obviously would have done things differently\
  \ should time decide to dance back 15 years for my sake."
