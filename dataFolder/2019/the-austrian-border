Text: "I was exactly 45 minutes in Austria. It was unexpected and sudden to visit\
  \ there but one of the most emotional parts of my life. I was on a trip to south\
  \ Germany and that day I visited Neuschwanstein castle. I was travelling with my\
  \ friend Vishvanath and visiting this castle was part of the trip. In the nail-biting\
  \ cold of December 2017, defying the grey weather we reached the castle. We spent\
  \ some time there and watched the ice-capped landscape from the top of the castle\
  \ grounds. I thought for a moment about how beautiful this place is and suddenly\
  \ my friend pointed out by seeing his map. \"Hey, can you see those houses far away,\
  \ they are in Austria.\"  We took a bus back to a small town F\xFCssen where we\
  \ were staying and after taking some rest we left to go see a famous waterfall near\
  \ the town called Lech fall. \nSince when I was a kid I was always intrigued with\
  \ the borders. No, I am not a fan of them. How can a sane person like them, they\
  \ divide the people. Ask a normal person from the Indian subcontinent and they will\
  \ tell you how much blood was spilt when our countries were partitioned. My dislike\
  \ for them is from that day when I learned about them. Before coming to Europe I\
  \ knew that there are open borders and I always thought of visiting them. \nSo,\
  \ we were walking towards the fall on the sidepath and my friend was busy taking\
  \ pictures. Suddenly a signboard struck on our way. It read in German that welcome\
  \ to Austria. I opened my google map and I discovered that we walked already 100\
  \ meters into the country. There was no police, no border control we just passed\
  \ through it. At the end of the day when I was lying on my bed, I thought why my\
  \ country couldn't do that. Why everyday day we are spilling the blood of each other\
  \ to protect something which is just mere a line drawn on maps."
