Text: "She was just a child. She exhaled and a fog of smoke escaped and joined the\
  \ drunken dancing in the air. She was the youngest of the group, and these were\
  \ her sisters, if not by blood, then by bonds even stronger. The authority, the\
  \ defiance radiating off them urged me to take a seat right there on the ground\
  \ with them.\nThe other girl, she was a machine gun. Bombs exploded out her mouth-\
  \ rapid and quick. Like bullets. Like a powerful firework show. Frightening so up\
  \ close. But mesmerising. The boldness. The confidence. These were four girls I\
  \ met \u2018na rua\u2019* in my search for the best samba places in Rio.\nI had\
  \ been to the south of Brazil. The dark colour of my skin stood out and raised so\
  \ many questions about my ethnicity, whether or not my African ancestors had practised\
  \ \u2018capoeira\u2019 and \u2018samba\u2019. The answer was no. These important\
  \ cultural practices, though born of African roots, I considered Brazilian and felt\
  \ no connection to them. But I went to the north anyway, to the Afro-descendants,\
  \ to see if maybe, just maybe, this rhythm that everyone expected to run in my blood,\
  \ truly did. \nAnd so I ended up in the middle of a crowded street, samba music\
  \ blasting through the air, groups of people huddled up in corners puffing out variously\
  \ scented smokes, and sitting atop a rock with four girls from a favela. \n\u201C\
  A gente morra na casa de todo mundo\u201D* they told me. \u2018A community house\u2019\
  . Yet their words were contradicted by the large notes they pulled out of their\
  \ wallets.\nThe music did echo through my bones, to answer the question that dragged\
  \ me to Rio. I wish I could believe it was because of my ancestry, but really, I\
  \ think the music is a compelling rhythm with the power to lift anyone to their\
  \ feet.\nThe next morning, I found myself sitting at a quaint cafe listening to\
  \ a boy in a pink shirt sing songs I never could possibly understand, but that I\
  \ felt deep within my soul to be true. He had a voice so compelling, so pure, that\
  \ I sat down right there and listened to him until the sunset. I speak enough Portuguese\
  \ to get by, but the words he sung were so ancient they were meant not to be understood,\
  \ but to be appreciated. He made me feel as though I was in love, but with what,\
  \ I don\u2019t know. \nWhat I do know is that I felt something in that city. Maybe\
  \ it was in the fierceness of those four girls, or in the music that played in the\
  \ streets. Whatever it is I felt, it was something so primordial, so fundamental,\
  \ that I know I have to go back and figure out what it truly is.\n\n\n\nna rua*\
  \ In the street\na gente morra na casa de todo mundo* We live in a communal house"
