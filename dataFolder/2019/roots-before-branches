Text: "At 2:57 AM on the 31st of July 1998, my life-journey started. The peculiarity\
  \ is that it started in a town called Ann Arbor, in Michigan, USA, on the opposite\
  \ side of the Atlantic Ocean compared to where I\u2019m from: Italy As  I often\
  \ say jokingly, my parents were pursuing the American dream. They needed experience\
  \ abroad to make their careers grow in their homeland, so they left and started\
  \ their family in an unknown world.\n\nI have no memories of the year we spent there,\
  \ but during my growth I remember dreaming of going back to the US. I wanted to\
  \ go there on my own, to discover by myself the places where i spent the firs moments\
  \ of my life. But I wasn\u2019t either old or brave enough.\n\nIt was not until\
  \ November 2017 that things changed. That year I started the university and I was\
  \ very confused about my choice. I wasn\u2019t sure that I could be able to start\
  \ building my adult life, living by myself. I was scared. So, I decided to challenge\
  \ myself and I bought plane tickets to go back to Michigan.\n\nI left Bologna on\
  \ March 28th and from there I went to Copenhagen, to Chicago and finally to Detroit.\
  \ I felt both thrilled and terrified, I didn\u2019t know what to expect and if things\
  \ wouldn\u2019t have gone as I hoped it could have been destructive to me. I had\
  \ to manage all my bags, my documents and I felt somehow unsafe. But I needed to\
  \ prove myself that I\u2019d make it.\n\nI planned everything: I would have stayed\
  \ in Ann Arbor for four days, hosted by a family that my parents had met when they\
  \ live there. Then I would have taken a bus to Toronto, second step New York and\
  \ finally back to Detroit, two days before taking the plane back home, on the 12th\
  \ of April. What would have I done in those towns? I had no idea. My only desire\
  \ was to experiment, beside being finally able to see a Broadway musical with my\
  \ own eyes. So it begun. Sixteen days that made the most unique experience of my\
  \ life up until today. \n\nTwo are the experiences that made this journey special.\
  \ First, the people I met. Traveling ten and more hours by bus can be boring but\
  \ I was surprised by the familiar environment that was created in every trip. Going\
  \ from NY to Detroit, we stopped in Cleveland, Ohio. It was four AM, I was tired\
  \ and annoyed. I couldn\u2019t imagine that, thanks to that two hours wait, I would\
  \ have met three people that opened my mind. They were a couple an an English lone-traveller.\
  \ The first two where going to Detroit to attenda t a friend\u2019s wedding. They\
  \ both had migration stories that broke my heart. Mostly hers was intense, as she\
  \ had crossed the Mexican border by foot with her mother when she was only five!\
  \ The English boy instead was in the US to visit all the 50 states without a time\
  \ limit. He was very inspiring to me! Also in Detroit I had the occasion to take\
  \ part in some initiatives organized inside Wayne State University for the \u201C\
  Italian Cultural Week\u201D. I met a different style of learning and it really helped\
  \ me clarify my options for my future career, exactly what I was looking for.\n\n\
  The second experience is probably the most formative and the one that changed my\
  \ view of the world. It\u2019s centered on the empowerment that I felt, as a young\
  \ women, and as a person traveling alone. I was able to focus on my own needs and\
  \ wants, to finally ask myself what I really wanted to do, I felt free. I also started\
  \ feeling safe because I trusted myself and my abilities more and more as the days\
  \ passed. Since then I have a new picture of myself.\n\nGoing back to my \u201C\
  roots\u201D to me it was like closing a circle. I felt like saying peacefully goodbye\
  \ to my child-self and finally being ready to embrace my adult life and starting\
  \ to grow my branches. As the song says: \u201CYou gotta have roots before branches\u201D\
