Text: My name is Sabrina Nuwera, I am from East Africa in Rwanda to be exact but also
  an international student here in the United States. My travel story has nothing
  extra ordinary to tell about because I am always very busy in between my classes
  and barely get time to sit and admire the beautiful diversified world I live in.
  Growing up diversity or I can our ethnic differences, had caused disastrous events
  in 1994 that caused more than 800 innocent deaths and for me I casted the world
  that could ever make us different in color, culture or language if the only thing
  we could get out was only being victims, hatred and violence. I certainly had a
  bad image of diversity and it was hard for me at first to get settled here because
  of the culture shock but with time, my understanding about diversity changed. As
  a economics major, I learned so much about how two nations or two cultures can converge
  and build a fruitful future for their people with the only meaning of understanding
  and good communication. That is when my zeal for discovering new perspectives and
  new cultures came. I am proud to say that I am now unfraid for culture shocks; in
  fact I have been able to travel in various countries in the Middle East and the
  United States and would like to go to Europe too. If I was able to win this scholarship,
  I would be immensely greatful because it is yet an open door for me to understand
  the world I live in and hopefully impact my community positively to have a good
  connotation of diversity and how we are privileged to live in this world. Thank
  you for your consideration.
