Text: "Nancy and I were biking along a pot-holed road down a peninsula under the hot\
  \ Caribbean sun, the last of the carrots my mother had bought to feed the island\
  \ donkeys in my backpack, when I had the second glimpse, albeit slight and fleeting,\
  \ that we were going to be okay. The first, oddly enough, had been intermingled\
  \ with the feelings of dread and despair that crashed over me when my father had\
  \ uttered the words \u201Cyour mother died\u201D two days before. Or maybe it was,\
  \ \u201Cyour mom has died.\u201D It definitely included the heartbreaking phrase,\
  \ \u201CI tried to save her but I couldn\u2019t.\u201D\n\tWe were cruising down\
  \ the only road that travelled the southeast end of Grand Turk Island from the charming\
  \ villa where we were staying. Because the cause of her death was a mystery, we\
  \ had to wait for the results of an autopsy before her remains could be released\
  \ and we could return home. We needed to distract ourselves, and the activity that\
  \ is the main reason people make the long trek to this tiny, quiet island was most\
  \ certainly off limits to us, as it had just resulted in the death of my mother.\
  \ The sun shone brightly, glinting off the beautiful turquoise water on either side\
  \ of us and the bleached limestone that made up the road and surrounding soil. The\
  \ wind was calm and cooling. It felt good to move our bodies, if only at a leisurely\
  \ clip. \n\tWe arrived at the end of the island and dismounted as my sisters, their\
  \ partners, and my father rolled up in a beat-up island car with the steering wheel\
  \ on the right side. Not once during our wanderings around the island throughout\
  \ our time on Grand Turk-- to pick up expensive imported beer, to hunt for the nonexistent\
  \ docks where the fishermen brought in their daily catch, to thank the medical staff\
  \ at the hospital for their unsuccessful attempt to intubate my mom and bring her\
  \ back to life-- would we successfully turn on the car\u2019s blinker, hitting the\
  \ windshield wipers instead.  We pulled the carrots out of our backpack and laughed\
  \ as the donkeys trotted over to us. Their lips and tongues were slimy as we fed\
  \ them the last of my mother\u2019s carrots.\nIt is difficult to put in to words\
  \ how strange it is to wait two weeks for the results of your mother\u2019s autopsy\
  \ in one of the most beautiful places you have ever been. Surrounded always by happy\
  \ sunburned families, we explored a different part of the island each day in brightly\
  \ colored tank tops and sandals. We ate conch ceviche with banana peppers and drank\
  \ pina coladas atop pure white sand as the surf gently lapped at our feet. We climbed\
  \ Sapodilla Bay Hill to search out 200 year old pirate etchings carved in to the\
  \ rocks at the summit. We drifted along with the current as we watched sea turtles\
  \ munching on eelgrass. We ate at the islands\u2019 best sushi, Indian, and Italian\
  \ restaurants, and (at least I) maintained a perfect low-grade vacation buzz thanks\
  \ to the island\u2019s terrible rum. We also sobbed, fought daily with bureaucrats\
  \ and health officials, planned a funeral, and drugged ourselves to sleep every\
  \ night with my mother\u2019s leftover sleeping pills. \nOur last day there, Dad\
  \ asked if we wanted to go to the beach where her body had been unloaded from the\
  \ boat and placed in an ambulance. We put on our bathing suits and sunscreen and\
  \ drove down. The setting could not have been more beautiful. The sand was ivory\
  \ white and the water was clear and blue. Like all of the days we were there, the\
  \ sky was dotted with puffy clouds, the sun shone brightly, and a light breeze kept\
  \ the heat at bay. My sisters, father and I held hands and walked out into the ocean.\
  \ When the water was waist deep, we circled up, our arms behind each other\u2019\
  s backs, and said our goodbyes. We baptized ourselves in the warm blue water and\
  \ made peace with the ocean, letting the salt water cleanse our wounds and rinse\
  \ away our tears. \n(excerpt from a much longer piece)"
