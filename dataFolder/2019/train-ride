Text: "The local DB bahn train that connects to the city centre was packed that afternoon\
  \ . I was not the only person heading to Zeil, the shopping Mecca of Frankfurt .\
  \ The train was exploding with people and it was tough to find a comfortable corner\
  \ to stand without being crushed. However After two train stops , the crowd started\
  \ melting away and I spotted an empty seat, thrilled I made my way towards it unaware\
  \ that my life was about to change.\nAfter Happily sitting down  , I started making\
  \ mental shopping notes, least intimidated by the eyes that were upon me.\n Being\
  \ an Indian tourist with brown skin it is customary to get attention in an European\
  \ country but the person sitting right opposite me in particular was gawking at\
  \ me shamelessly the whole time and it started making me feel uncomfortable. \n\
  A few minutes passed and yet I could feel his uninterrupted gaze on me.\nI decided\
  \ to look at him and end this bizzare feeling but to my surprise  I found a pleasant\
  \ looking young man smiling back at me.\nI smiled back in return but he continued\
  \ smiling without making any conversation.My stop had arrived And I Got off the\
  \ train unwillingly but the whole day  I spent thinking about him. \nA part in me\
  \ wanted to know him and meet him again. \nThe next day I headed back to the city\
  \ centre In the afternoon to grab lunch and buy a watch. Though I had an appetising\
  \ Schnitzel but I didn\u2019t find a watch that grabbed my fancy , disappointed\
  \  I wanted head back  to my hotel . \nWhile I was walking towards the train station,\
  \ I heard someone yell behind , \u201CHey ! hey ! but I didn\u2019t bother looking\
  \ back.\nIn a city where I was a tourist without knowing a soul in the new city,\
  \ it was a remote possibility that I might encounter someone familiar. \nBut the\
  \ \u201Cheys\u201D didn\u2019t stop and I turned behind curiously , it was the same\
  \ man from the train approaching me! I froze.\nIn a buzzing city like Frankfurt\
  \ where weekends are full of tourists  and movement is so fast , this was a sheer\
  \ co-incidence.\nHe greeted me in a friendly manner and introduced himself . I could\
  \ tell that he was attracted to me. \nAfter exchanging pleasantries , He asked me\
  \ out for Coffee and I accepted the invitation as I was keen to know him .\nWe found\
  \ A lovely outdoor cafeteria just minutes away from the train station and spent\
  \ the next two hours in each other\u2019s company drinking Cafe Latte\u2019s.\n\
  When it was time for us to say goodbye , we both agreed that it was a strange coincidence\
  \ that our paths crossed each other\u2019s and vowed to keep in touch. \nThe next\
  \ day I left for Italy to celebrate my birthday week .\nWhen I arrived in Genoa\
  \ and met my friends , I told them about this strange encounter I had with this\
  \ man . \nThey encouraged me to invite him to Italy and make him a part of the celebration\
  \ , as they felt it was an extraordinary encounter. \n\nAnd indeed it was a lovely\
  \ encounter because today I\u2019m married to him and have children . \nSometimes\
  \ I wonder , if it was not for that one vacant seat on that train , how else would\
  \ I have met the love of my life."
