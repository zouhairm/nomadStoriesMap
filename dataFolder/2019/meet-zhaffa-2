Text: "We landed in Kuala-Lumpur in the early morning after a sleepless night. If\
  \ it could help, I would swallow my coffee with a cup \u2013 anything to get rid\
  \ of that drowsy feeling. Kuala-Lumpur was our transit city on the way to Singapore\
  \ and we had only 10 hours at our disposal to explore the capital of Malaysia. Thus,\
  \ two Sleeping Beauties hit off the road towards their short adventure. On our way\
  \ to Batu Caves, we tried to use any chance to get some sleep. The first failed\
  \ attempt was on a shuttle bus from the airport, where it was so cold inside that\
  \ we were close to fall into anabiosis, yet, not asleep. \nI must admit that navigation\
  \ in a country without knowing its local language is a total disaster, especially,\
  \ when your body spends its last energy to stay awake. However, somehow we did it\
  \ \u2013 found the right rout and were waiting for our train that was expected to\
  \ arrive within 45 minutes. We found a perfect empty bench on the platform, set\
  \ up alarm clock, got in a comfortable position, closed our eyes and\u2026\n\u201C\
  Hello! Where are you from?\u201D\nI raised my head to see the one who dared to disturb\
  \ me. I already prepared my eyes to give him a very very angry and reproachful gaze,\
  \ when he asked again:\n\u201CMay I sit with you?\u201D \n\u201CYes, please.\u201D\
  \ said my friend cheerfully, while I was busy staring at the screen with the schedule.\
  \ 43 minutes left.\nA chubby old man sat on a bench with us. He was wearing a stylish\
  \ pair of sunglasses, though there was no sun in here.\n\u201CWhere are you headed\
  \ to?\u201D \n\u201CBatu Caves.\u201D\n\u201COh, how lucky I am to share my commute\
  \ with two beautiful ladies from Russia and Ukraine!\u201D\nHis flow of speech was\
  \ quite slow and sometimes not distinguishable. Zhaffa, our new friend, was born\
  \ and raised in Kuala-Lumpur, in his sixties, married to the most beautiful woman\
  \ in the world, had two wonderful children, and a personal cosmetologist, who advised\
  \ him to protect his skin from the aggressive sun, especially a vulnerable eye zone.\
  \ He also owned a small online store, where a customer could buy Malaysian styled\
  \ shirts. He loved shirts of any kind. The shirt he was wearing at that moment was\
  \ his favorite \u2013 of a classic blue color with small white buttons and abbreviated\
  \ spread collar. That morning he was commuting to visit his old friend who he had\
  \ not seen for a long time. Zhaffa usually amused himself by watching short funny\
  \ videos when waiting for his train. But that day was his lucky day, because he\
  \ could show them to two beautiful young ladies and amuse them as well. He did amuse\
  \ us \u2013 we saw everything that was kept on his smartphone. Well, he tried his\
  \ best. So did we \u2013 tried our best to listen and watch attentively, imitate\
  \ interest and curiosity on the last leg that we actually were saving for Batu Caves.\
  \ By the end of our one-hour conversation I could perfectly understand his Malaysian\
  \ accent. Right in the middle of his ode to Kuala-Lumpur Zhaffa suddenly stood up,\
  \ waved us good bye and left the train:\n\u201CHave a safe trip to Singapore, I\u2019\
  ll call you later!\u201D said our new Malaysian friend.\nAnd he called. We just\
  \ had our first delicious and expensive breakfast in Singapore, returned to the\
  \ hostel to pick up some things, when I saw someone calling me. It was weird that\
  \ my Chinese number was available there:\n\u201CHello?\u201D said I with curiosity.\
  \ \nIt was Zhaffa. \n\u201CHello, hello! This is me, we met yesterday in Kuala-Lumpur.\
  \ Do you remember me?\u201D\n\u201COh, right, of course. How are you?\u201D\n\u201C\
  I have an appointment with my cosmetologist today. Are you in Singapore? Is everything\
  \ alright?\u201D asked he with parental care as if we were his daughters. \n\u201C\
  Yeah, we are fine!\u201D\n\u201COkay, girls, call you later!\u201D\nAnd he never\
  \ did."
