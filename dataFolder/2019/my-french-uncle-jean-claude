Text: "December 2015, Genova, I\u2019m stuck in a life which I did not want, working\
  \ as HR advisor in a big company. Last summer I went visiting a village in Piemonte,\
  \ Italy, which means a lot to me. My parents used to bring me here since I was 3\
  \ and there I spent my best summers during childhood. It\u2019s been a while I was\
  \ not coming over and the first thing I did was asking local people if my French\
  \ uncle Jean-Claude was still around. Jean-Claude was a 60 years old French man\
  \ which I accidentally met on a bowls tournament when I was 7. \u201CI\u2019m sorry,\
  \ you\u2019re gonna loose today kid\u201D, he said to me to the very first time,\
  \ while smoking a Gauloises and with his unforgettable hard French accent. From\
  \ that moment, we built up an incredible friendship all over the years and he became\
  \ my so-called French uncle. On that day of December 2015 memories bring me back\
  \ to last summer, when I got to know that he was not coming over anymore to Piemonte.\
  \ He was getting too old, his wife passed away and he was also seriously ill. On\
  \ the same night I call my mother \u201CHey you must find a postcard Jean-Claude\
  \ sent me almost 10 years ago, I need to know where he is, I want to see him, and\
  \ I want to see him now\u201D. \nFew weeks later, it is the 26th of December and\
  \ my alarm beeps at 5:00 am. Suddenly I start thinking I\u2019m crazy, what\u2019\
  s the point of going visiting an old man, I just have a phone number and nothing\
  \ else and I\u2019m supposed to drive for more than 6 hours. Everybody told me just\
  \ a crazy man like me can do it but it\u2019s too late for going back, I put my\
  \ sunglasses on like Jake & Elwood and start my ride towards Jean-Claude. His town\u2019\
  s name is Martigue, a small village not far from Marseille. I leave car in a huge\
  \ parking, close to the sea and while watching grey waves I make my call. Nobody\
  \ answers. I start being depressed quickly, while having a view of Martigue. Back\
  \ to my car, I\u2019m about to leave and then.. then my mobile rings, it\u2019s\
  \ a French number, it\u2019s Jean Claude\nSalut?\nOh my God, I think, his voice\
  \ is much older than expected. \n-\tBonjour Jean\u2013Claude do you remember me?\
  \ It\u2019s Matteo here\n-\tMatteo, Matteo yes I do, how are you my Italian friend,\
  \ so much time passed from the last time we saw each other and I\u2019m now old,\
  \ you know.\n-\tJean- Claude I\u2019m very good and listen I\u2019m at your place,\
  \ yes je suis ici, \xE0 Martigue! I\u2019d love to catch up with you, is it possible?\n\
  For a couple of minutes I do not receive any answers, I start getting worried and\
  \ then: \n-\tMatteo? You serious? Ce n\u2019est pas possible!\n-\tOh yes it is!\
  \ Give me your address and will be right there\nJean-Claude is now having the same\
  \ voice he had the first time I met him, almost 25 years ago. He explains me everything\
  \ in details and calls me twice while I\u2019m still driving. And then, there he\
  \ is. He\u2019s older, his hairs are much less blonde than how I remember but I\
  \ don\u2019t care, we\u2019re hugging each other, his eyes are shining, he still\
  \ does not believe I\u2019ve made all this just to say hello. We spend the whole\
  \ afternoon together, and then it is time to say good-bye. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve\
  \ decided will not be back home, will take this opportunity to make my first lonely\
  \ trip, with my car I\u2019ll be visiting south-west of France, Northern Spain and\
  \ will finally arrive in Oporto, Portugal. I will see Jean-Claude just one time\
  \ more, when I\u2019m heading back to Genova. Few months ago, a call advises me\
  \ that he just passed away. That night, together with Jean-Claude, I\u2019m thinking\
  \ to all stunning emotions I lived on that trip. And that night, with my eyes still\
  \ wet of tears, I start realizing that I do not want  keep on doing this life, I\
  \ want travelling and writing, starting from the story of my French uncle Jean-Claude."
