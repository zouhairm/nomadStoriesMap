Text: "There is a life out there that you have been dreaming of. There is a place\
  \ that is hidden ready for you to find. The universe is so big and the creation\
  \ so wide. Do you ever wonder what is beyond the horizon  you see? Let me take you\
  \ to this magical place located in the middle of world called ECUADOR. All you need\
  \ is love and all you need to see is the amazing waterfalls, mountains, oceans,\
  \ jungles and islands from this place all of it in one. \nEcuador is just 109,483\
  \ miles smaller than the state of Nevada with 16 million people wow! Small place\
  \ but full of kind loving people that kiss you and hug you even if they dont know\
  \ you. Because we are all one and we all deserve to be treated equally. If you believe\
  \ in love you are in the right place when you step into this wonderful new world\
  \ you will experience a taste of dreams and reality and you will never know if you\
  \ are dreaming or not. \nI was impressed with their culture, their love to still\
  \ make things with their hands and share their talents with everyone. Their food\
  \ with natural ingredients, their delicious  fruits that are not heard of anywhere\
  \ else, that melt in your mouth. My favorite \"jugo de guanabana\" white fruit from\
  \ the inside and green from the outside makes you fall in love literally haha. I\
  \ was in love every day I spend there. \nI recommend to visit the 4 regions from\
  \ this country. It won't take you long because of the size of it. Its impressive!\
  \ \nFirst region is La Sierra where the mountains are and the weather is like Spring\
  \ time all year. Lots of history, cathedrals, monuments and the capital called Quito\
  \ makes a superior 5 start stay with their views.  The Cost where the beaches are,\
  \ some of their beaches boarding the Pacific Ocean look like Miami Beach, but with\
  \ authentic sea food straight from the sea to your plate. The Oriente where the\
  \ jungle is and native people welcome you with open arms.  You can dream of a new\
  \ world there play with birds, monkeys and snakes yeah! \nThe Galapagos Islands\
  \ where the sand has different colors and you find giant tortoises that are not\
  \ found anywhere else in the entire planet. Magic all around! \nEcuador has a taste\
  \ of an unknown magic that I want to keep forever with me. I can go back there every\
  \ summer and explore all their magnetic places that are yet to be seen. \nI know\
  \ dreams come true and if you really believe they will happen, they will! Ecuador\
  \ is the place you what to visit if you like to explore the universe and dream while\
  \ you are awake! \nCome with me."
