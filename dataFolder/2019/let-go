Text: "I clung tightly to the moto driver as the strong smell of gasoline and sweat\
  \ filled the air. The driver kept inching forward and I followed him fiercely with\
  \ my panic and my grip. Five days into my trip and I still wasn\u2019t used to squishing\
  \ onto a small taxi bike with one, or sometimes two, other people. Drivers here\
  \ wove in and out of traffic with ease. There was no clear designation of lanes\
  \ and certainly not less than four directions of traffic at all times. People drove\
  \ their cars, motorbikes, tuk tuks, in whichever direction there was space. It seemed\
  \ so messy, yet no one seemed to get in the way of anyone else. \n\nAs we took the\
  \ turn onto the street with the Lucky 7 grocery store, the landmark in Phnom Penh\
  \ that signalled we were back in the main part of town and close to home, the moto\
  \ driver tried to inch more forward but there was no space. I knew it, but I wouldn\u2019\
  t let go. Ahanh, sensing the tiny but clear space that had grown between her and\
  \ I yelled over the loud engine, \u201Cnot polite to touch driver with body\u201D\
  \ she said. I stiffened. Did she want me to let go? \u201CWhy?\u201D I shouted into\
  \ the driver\u2019s ear without turning my head to answer. Ahanh, casually sitting\
  \ sideways on the bike, hanging on with one hand and gesturing with the other replied,\
  \ \u201CNo touch here. Not even boyfriend touch. No touch.\u201D\n\nMy shoulders\
  \ dropped. I was violating a significant cultural practice because of my fear. I\
  \ took a deep inhale and breathed in gas fumes, pressed on the pedals under my feet\
  \ to lift myself up, and moved myself a full inch back toward Ahanh. I slowly loosened\
  \ my grip on the driver so that I was just loosely hanging onto his waist. I breathed\
  \ in again. I took one hand off of him and quickly reached around behind me to grab\
  \ Ahanh. I had already learned the previous day that women holding hands to help\
  \ each other was ok. She met my hand in response confirming it and held onto my\
  \ arm tightly. The driver immediately adjusted and visibly relaxed his shoulders.\
  \ I squeezed my eyes shut against the dust and fear.   \n\nThe driver soon slowed\
  \ and dropped us off across the street from the internet caf\xE9. I paid him the\
  \ American dollar for the ride and he took it and left unceremoniously. Ahanh pointed\
  \ across the street to the caf\xE9. \n\nAhanh, 14, was the housekeeper\u2019s daughter\
  \ at the home I was staying at. She was working part time with her mother, Mai,\
  \ to help herself and her brother through school. She was studying English. She\
  \ was showing me the way to the internet caf\xE9 on her way to the market. She pointed\
  \ at the caf\xE9 across the road and said \u201Cthat\u201D.\n\nI looked both ways\
  \ to cross the street but the same dizzying traffic continued in all directions.\
  \ My head turned to my left and to my right several times but I couldn\u2019t see\
  \ a break in traffic. I kept taking steps to my left, thinking one of the steps\
  \ would eventually move in the forward direction. I looked to my left for the umpteenth\
  \ time and suddenly felt Ahanh gently take my hand in hers and lead us confidently\
  \ and briskly across the street. \n\nOnce crossed, I stood there, letting the moment\
  \ sink in. A 14 year old just safely walked me across a chaotic street. A moto driver\
  \ just got me safely to my destination despite the odds. I had to admit it. There\
  \ was a magic here. An unspoken flow to life. And in that moment, I realized that\
  \ it was all much bigger than me. All I had to do was let go. \n\nWith a big smile,\
  \ Ahanh pointed again at the caf\xE9 in front of us, took a small bow and left for\
  \ the market. I looked at her walk away a moment before I made my way inside. I\
  \ smiled. I had arrived."
