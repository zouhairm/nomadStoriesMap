Text: "The terracotta bricks of Madang road are worn in such a stalwart way that I\
  \ imagined they must have once been bright vermilion. Not a crack or a chip flaws\
  \ any of the buildings, only the softening of harsh colour and accent. I begin to\
  \ suspect that they were refurbished to look this way, aged through design and artifice,\
  \ rather than history. \nThe name of the area, Xingshijie, translates to \u2018\
  new world\u2019. A shop that sells fragrances for the home, mainly diffusers, with\
  \ a sampling of essential oils, carries a New Zealand Aromatherapy Co. diffuser,\
  \ the same one I have at home in Auckland. It was three times the price here. My\
  \ mother and her sister walked five paces behind me. In their heads, they held a\
  \ safety leash attached to my arm. \nMost of the points of interest I researched\
  \ took me to minor museums and galleries. The former site of the provisional government\
  \ of Korea occupies a small set of residential buildings, separated by an alley,\
  \ from local shops hidden from the main road. The entrance reminded me of a visa\
  \ office. An unusual electric fan shaped like half of a giant capsule cooled the\
  \ guests sitting on simple metal stools, watching an introduction to the museum\
  \ on a TV hung high on the wall. All the visitors spoke Korean apart from my mother,\
  \ aunt and me. \nEntrance was 20 yuan. \u201CWe\u2019ll wait here,\u201D said my\
  \ aunt, \u201Cyou\u2019re the one who wanted to see this.\u201D I was given a colour-printed\
  \ ticket, and told to hand it to a guard at the entrance. I backtracked into the\
  \ alley, following free-standing wooden signs that reminded me of a buffet restaurant.\
  \ I expected to have to put plastic covers on my shoes, as I did at several other\
  \ heritage buildings, but I only saw an empty hallway. I thought I had gotten lost\
  \ and entered someone\u2019s home.\nShanghai is unbearably warm in October. I wasn't\
  \ surprised to find a woman sleeping on a chair in the alcove formed by a set of\
  \ stairs. She had an official looking uniform on. Assuming she was the guard, I\
  \ woke her, and she jolted up, hitting her head on the staircase. She rubbed her\
  \ head as I handed her my ticket. I was instructed to ascend the staircase, where\
  \ the museum began. Once she took my ticket, she went back to sleep. \nThe history\
  \ was explained in Chinese and Korean, neither of which I could read fluently. The\
  \ exhibits were arranged in such an organic way that they appeared to have been\
  \ unmoved since its use during the Japanese invasion of Korea. The only difference\
  \ was the leaders and bureaucrats had been replaced by mannequins. They held one\
  \ pose each, carefully dressed and positioned to capture the scene of an official,\
  \ dressed in a 1920s western-style suit taking a call at a powerful table. The building\
  \ had three floors, some rooms now dedicated to administrative use. I imagine they\
  \ store the cleaning supplies and perhaps the artefacts which garner little interest.\
  \ \nI grew accustomed to the emptiness, rooms where only the sound of impatient\
  \ traffic penetrated. Each horn carried the memory of crowds into the quiet. I tried\
  \ to read a metal plaque hung on the third floor. I could only recognise some characters,\
  \ and tried to piece it together with the fragments of history I knew. It felt like\
  \ I was pressing my fingertips against a countertop, and licking the crumbs of this\
  \ building\u2019s story into my mouth. The words carried so much, yet I detected\
  \ no flavour from the crumbs I could swallow. \nI ended the visit short, having\
  \ cast a glance over everything. It was my usual completionist method of exploring.\
  \ I felt my 20 yuan was wasted. \nI returned to the waiting room. The video was\
  \ replaying from the beginning. \n\u201CWas it interesting? Had your money\u2019\
  s worth now? I never would have come here if you didn\u2019t say. None of us locals\
  \ notice these places.\u201D my aunt asked.\nI told her it was interesting. \nAs\
  \ we walked to a mall to cool down in some air con, I wondered whether the guard\
  \ hit her head every time a guest arrived."
