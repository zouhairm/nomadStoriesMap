Text: "This was the first time that I got a glimpse of travel as \"travail\" - a difficult\
  \ journey. Originally, any form of \"travel\" (in the Middle Ages, where the word\
  \ originated) was found to be difficult, laborious, hence the etymology. But over\
  \ the centuries, travel as we have come to know it has become easier - less about\
  \ necessity and transportation and more about choice and place. More about arrival\
  \ than the journey there and back. \n\nFor the first time in my life, this wasn't\
  \ the case for me. My departure for India started weeks before I found myself in\
  \ any close proximity to an airplane. And my arrival and experience while there\
  \ has extended far beyond the time when I returned to Canadian soil. \n\nI went\
  \ into it with a head full of facts, of \"don't dos\" and \"avoid thats\", of cautionary\
  \ tales and reminders - all realistic and justified but all barriers to a full experience.\
  \ I wrapped my head around expectations and assumptions, and then tried to let go.\
  \ I wanted to build my understanding of India from scratch.\n\nDaily, my senses\
  \ were inundated with a myriad of impossible happenings occurring all in a relatively\
  \ small, but very real, space. \n\nI have a distinct memory of a colourfully clad\
  \ woman at the Kinari Market in Agra with a sack of something that looked pretty\
  \ heavy on her head, holding two babies in one arm, her other hand busied with maneuvering\
  \ her sari to cover her mouth as she stepped into a cloud of yellow vapour. My eyes\
  \ followed her steps as she stepped into an intersection between a speeding rickshaw\
  \ that missed her hip by a few inches and a surprisingly fast-moving cement roller\
  \ with an elderly half-naked man in a turban, his knees jutted out by his ears as\
  \ he crouched at its wheel; below her at her bare feet, a deformed young man struggled\
  \ to move himself forward on a small wooden cart. Next to her, a black, bony cow\
  \ obliviously dawdled next to her, miraculously avoiding the dung and burning garbage\
  \ (read: open flames) on the unpaved ground. Accompany this with a cacophony of\
  \ honks, horns, bells, and incomprehensible human and animal voices, and a heavy\
  \ humidity in the air that carries dozens of smells and fragrances that stick to\
  \ your skin and sting your eyes, and you'll still have only a partial understanding\
  \ of what I saw in those short four seconds.\n\nIt was hard not to gape in awe,\
  \ my eyes, tongue, ears, nostrils, fingers, all ready to take in the scenes around\
  \ me. But I had to consciously remind myself to use my heart.\n\nAmidst the hodgepodge\
  \ of machinery and limbs, noise, colors and smells and mire, I searched for opportunity\
  \ when most everything seemed teeming with risk (like contracting the dreaded \"\
  Delhi belly\"). With effort, the initial miasma of Indian life, of that traffic,\
  \ poverty, and filth (garbage in all four states) transformed into a kind of magic\
  \ show: A medley of unlikely occurrences and dense bits of experience that came\
  \ together making me believe there was no single other possible way this place could\
  \ be.\n\nA land of contrasts. It was hard work, remaining cautious without being\
  \ paranoid; at temples, I removed my shoes along with my prejudices; I salivated\
  \ between wafts of indescribably disgusting odors, laughed heartily with people\
  \ who lived under unbearable weights of hardship, shivered at fifty degrees, and\
  \ sometimes, just didn't know what to feel except Present.\n\nIndia, despite its\
  \ initial unsetting exterior, was an incredibly inviting, pleasant, at times, even\
  \ relaxing, place. In the presence of a lot of poverty and discomfort, I found joy\
  \ - the kind you find everywhere where there is human life. Even the notoriously\
  \ aggressive touts when approached the right way, with respect, backbone and warmth,\
  \ reciprocated, dropping their greedy guise to offer a smile and a joke. \n\nIt\
  \ wasn't easy to arrive at this kind of India; it took a certain effort and altering\
  \ of attitude to step up, open up, and enter. What I didn't foresee was the difficulty\
  \ that I'd experience in not just getting there or being there, but in coming home.\
  \ Staying put, a travail of its own..."
