Text: "It was my second day in Peru when I met my fellow psychonauts at the California\
  \ Cafe. I'm starting from day two because on day one I was getting hideously wasted\
  \ in the hotel bar and talking to the bartender all night about music. My Spanish\
  \ is terrible, his English is ok and I think we came to an understanding. California\
  \ Cafe is a cool place, you get the sense that this is where the hip, young, trendy\
  \ people (not to mention tourists also) hang out and consume smoothies alongside\
  \ delicious caffeinated beverages. If you're passing through Huaraz and feel parched\
  \ I suggest trying this place. But I did not come here for coffee however, I came\
  \ here for one reason alone, to have a spiritual awakening and to try the most potent\
  \ psychedelic known to man.\n\nWhen I was younger I took very much to heart a lot\
  \ of the East-West synthesis that has become known as the contemporary New Age movement.\
  \ I attempted to practise mediation, among other quite ridiculous things such as\
  \ so-called astral travelling, which I succeeded in once or twice and basically\
  \ amounts to a hallucinated out of body experience. But this is beside the point.\
  \ The point is that I've always been the sort of person who thinks empirically and\
  \ wants to know, on the basis of evidence, what the truth is about the world and\
  \ human experience as delineated from what we're told by religious and spiritual\
  \ organisations and spokespeople. I was already a hardened atheist at this point\
  \ and I will never stop treating the claims of religion and spiritual 'teachers'\
  \ with scepticism.\n\nThe attitude among the group of people I was with I feel was\
  \ somewhat similar, it was an attitude of a group of people who either needed to\
  \ be healed for some reason or because they too are sceptical and are seeking to\
  \ avow or disavow their spiritual convictions on the basis of evidence. Talking\
  \ to these people you get the sense that they're very much in the New Age tradition.\
  \ Also at The Way Inn, where the retreat was to be held, there were yoga classes\
  \ on offer as well as Ayurvedic readings and dietary advice and also tai chi. I\
  \ found tai chi and yoga very painful and will not be doing these again in a hurry.\
  \ The Ayurvedic medicine was also interesting and it told me that I had a decent\
  \ balance of the three Ayurvedic elements in me, which I took to be a good thing.\n\
  \nThe most striking thing about the location was the scenery; The Way Inn crouches\
  \ on a foothill of the Cordillera Blanca, from the porch you can see the tip of\
  \ the mountain Artesonraju (the Paramount mountain); then of course there's the\
  \ view on the other side with Huaraz nestling in the valley beneath, still at 3,000\
  \ meters above sea level. \n\nOn the first day at The Way Inn we were introduced\
  \ to Alex and the rest of the team at Ayahuasca Satsangha who gave us our formal\
  \ introduction to Ayahuasca and the Shamanic dieta that we'd be following throughout\
  \ the course of our two weeks there. The dieta is considered an integral part of\
  \ the experience. It is a selection of rather bland foods, mostly boiled fish and\
  \ quinoa and this has somehow been shown to be effective at bringing on visionary\
  \ experiences from the Ayahuasca. Prior to these experiences (seven in total) I'd\
  \ already read Aldous Huxley's The Doors of Perception  and would be using this\
  \ as my yardstick to gauge the experience from a secular perspective.\n\nI could\
  \ write a book about the first experience alone. It really was that breathtaking,\
  \ serene, deep, complex, esoteric and, ultimately, pleasant. I am aware however\
  \ that not everyone's experience was the same. Ayahuasca also purges your body and,\
  \ as such, I felt refreshed and brilliant on the days after the second experience,\
  \ which like all of the experiences in their first hour or so, included a lot of\
  \ vomiting and diarrhoea before one can settle in to enjoy the experience. If you\
  \ like tripping and want something to change your life as this has changed mine\
  \ I'd recommend Ayahuasca."
