Text: "I arrived in Cancun a day late after having spent the previous 24 hours falling\
  \ in love with a German traveler in Merida. \n\nIt was 6pm when the bus rolled in.\
  \ I had to find an ATM to take out enough cash for the two nights at the hostel\
  \ and the hour-long taxi ride ahead. 8pm was the check-in time, I remembered - a\
  \ peculiar policy for a beach town, I thought. I reached into my pocket for my debit\
  \ card. It wasn\u2019t there. I tried my other pockets, my passport, my bra, my\
  \ shoe\u2026 but it still wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI ran to the coffee counter to borrow\
  \ a phone. The clerk handed me her cellphone. I started to dial the Canadian number,\
  \ but couldn\u2019t bare the thought of the international fees placed on this global\
  \ citizen, so I handed her back the phone and ran across the street for the McDonald\u2019\
  s, for they had wifi.\n\nI called everyone who I knew that had their life together.\
  \ Nobody picked up. Except for my ex, who was able to get in contact with my mother,\
  \ who was able to put my debit card on hold. (Why was it that he could get a hold\
  \ of her when I couldn\u2019t?)\n\nIt got dark. I tracked down a cab. He agreed\
  \ to take me to the entrance of the town, no further. with the 60 pesos I had left\
  \ I got to the hostel at about 1am. A girl from my room let me in the gate. She\
  \ asked me how I arrived. \u201CLong story,\u201D I said, and went to bed.\n\nA\
  \ shake of the legs. \u201CBecca! Wasn\u2019t your flight at six?\u201D \n\n\u201C\
  Yeah, so? What time is it?\u201D \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s seven.\u201D \n\nWhen set my\
  \ alarm for 4am, my cellphone was still set to Vancouver time PST, three hours behind\
  \ Cancun. My alarm didn\u2019t wake me until 7am local time, to catch my flight\
  \ that had already left at 6.\n\nI ran out the door without paying. The girl borrowed\
  \ me 100 pesos for a taxi and told me she\u2019d make my bed and tell the reception\
  \ I was a no-show.\n\nI stood in line at United Airlines desk, running through possible\
  \ valid clauses missing my flight - food poisoning, stolen debit card, ransom, student\
  \ loans, \u201CYo no hablo Espa\xF1ol\u201D\u2026 when someone gently placed their\
  \ hand on my left shoulder\u2026\n\n\u201CDisculpe, miss. May I ask which flight\
  \ you are scheduled for?\u201D He was dressed in a United Airlines uniform.\n\n\u201C\
  Well yes, the 11am\u2026 it\u2019s complicated. You see, someone stole my debit\
  \ card on my way here and I\u2019ve had food poisoning for the passed nine days\
  \ and the receptionist didn\u2019t call my taxi on time and I feel I may pass out\
  \ talking to you, so I missed my 6am flight to Vancouver this morning (at no fault\
  \ of my own), and I\u2019m hoping to be placed on 11 o\u2019clock at no charge.\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CWhat if I said I can have your flight rescheduled for tomorrow morning\
  \ at 11am, if you stay just one more night here in Cancun at the Marriott Hotel\
  \ - a four-star resort on the beach? We overbooked the 11am flight. We need people\
  \ to volunteer to stay an extra night.\u201D\n\n\u201CBut I don\u2019t even have\
  \ my ticket yet.\u201D\n\n\u201CBy the sounds of it, you have the right to be on\
  \ the 11 o\u2019clock flight.You will have to pay a small only a small ticket exchange\
  \ fee, that I will have reimbursed in double with this $500 USD flight voucher.\
  \ My colleagues will help you out at the desk. Your valet is waiting for you at\
  \ the door.\u201D\n\nI got to the resort with 20 pesos left in my pocket. I had\
  \ two queen-sized beds to choose from and an unlimited jumbo shrimp buffet, but\
  \ somehow still felt dissatisfied. I wanted to go to town and meet locals. I went\
  \ to the ATM to take out money with my visa card, despite the transaction fees.\
  \ The machine ate my card and I started crying.\n\nI called my ex, who called my\
  \ mom, who was able to cancel my credit card.\n\nI went back to my room to watch\
  \ tv with my family of towel swans."
