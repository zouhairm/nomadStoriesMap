Text: "\u201CAre you from the Middle East?\u201D \nThis was, and continues to be,\
  \ the first misconception London seems to have about me. When I arrived in the capital\
  \ five months ago, I came with two large suitcases, a preparation for the iron-rich\
  \ air on the tube, and a few dreams to make something of my Master\u2019s degree.\
  \ I expected to find an inordinate fondness of the city\u2019s inhabitants for independent\
  \ pubs, steely skies, and equally steely faces of pedestrians hurrying on in grumbling\
  \ rain. Thankfully, my estimates were correct. But having moved residences continually\
  \ in my twenty-two years of existence, what I did not expect was to find myself\
  \ feeling at home in the city snaking around the Thames. \n\nMy flat faces a small\
  \ pub with a fancy English name, The George. It is bordered by a residential building\
  \ with a colour scheme of brown, beige and cream. Very nonchalant, very British.\
  \ Any suburban neighbourhood in London smells slightly of Middle-Eastern food, chimney\
  \ smoke, and rain-washed tar. Mine is no different. While it lacks the sheen of\
  \ Notting Hill, it makes for an interesting study with its nondescript walls, punk-haired\
  \ beggars under the overground track, and a children\u2019s library juxtaposed against\
  \ an abandoned warehouse. Winding my way down Holloway Road, I find London\u2019\
  s soul resting by the railroad next to a recycling facility. It is in the disciplined\
  \ lines of white, terraced houses, gigantic red buses gliding on impeccable roads,\
  \ life-saving convenience stores that glare in the 2 a.m. tube-light, and a multitude\
  \ of manicured parks. As I walk past women in burqas lugging around children and\
  \ Tesco bags, the city fills me with a nostalgia for home \u2014 a place that I\
  \ continue to seek, one that continues to elude me. \n\nAs a new girl in a foreign\
  \ city, I learn to celebrate small joys. There is an air of familiarity in finding\
  \ a go-to cafe across the street, a sense of accomplishment in figuring out which\
  \ Eastbound train to board. And by the end of my second month, the final triumph\
  \ of childlike glee comes on being asked for directions to the Caledonian Road bus-stop.\
  \ In my first few months in London, I have turned a hundred identical street-corners,\
  \ walked a hundred alleys \u2014 alleys with promises of quiet and shadows. Alleys\
  \ in which you miss a lover. Alleys, also, which remind you that you are enough\
  \ on your own. Enough to read London in Blyton and Dickens, and enough to explore\
  \ it by yourself with a little help from strangers and Harry Beck of the London\
  \ Underground Map repute.\n\nAn alien city that sometimes glitters like the moon\
  \ and at other times is coloured by solid yellow smog \u2014 this is how I know\
  \ London. It is simultaneously too bright and too lacking in lustre. Identities\
  \ multiplied and closing in on themselves, including mine. London is where I realise\
  \ it takes time to make friends who don\u2019t merely double as companions for a\
  \ pub-crawl. For a long time in this global melting-pot, I stuck to my identity\
  \ as a \u2018new girl in the city\u2019, coming to terms with loneliness one sip\
  \ of 'chai' at a time. London is suburban angst personified; the structured tube-service\
  \ goes hand in hand with the formless feeling it evokes. Its sleeping towers belong\
  \ to everyone. But the relatable plaque in front of the Tate Modern, a free morning\
  \ coffee, and the friendly Turkish lady at the laundrette belong to me. As London\
  \ oscillates between leaving me out and welcoming me in, I pick up the takeaway\
  \ of kebabs and head home. The kebabs taste different, as does the air. English\
  \ breakfast tea cannot replace 'adrak wali chai' but I am willing to strike a bargain.\
  \ Maybe this is why these days I text my mother \u201Cheading home\u201D. Maybe\
  \ this is what home means: a different tea, but that one teacup to sip from wherever\
  \ you go."
