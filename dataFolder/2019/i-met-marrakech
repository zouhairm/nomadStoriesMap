Text: "I still conflicted about defining my visit to Marrakech as a simple journey.\
  \ \nIt was more like getting to know someone new, for me: discovering his character\
  \ little by little, loving the peculiar nuances that make it unique and not understanding\
  \ some of its contradictions.\nIt was the first time I had left Europe to go and\
  \ discover a new continent.\nEvery place, city or landscape I\u2019ve ever seen\
  \ before always had something that looked or sounded familiar, until that moment.\n\
  It happens sometimes to find a common ground in history, in architecture, and even\
  \ in language.\nYet in Marrakech everything had new colours and scents. The scent\
  \ of the soil heated by the sun, the sweetness of oranges and dates mixed with the\
  \ aroma of turmeric and other spices.\n\nJemaa el-Fnaa is the market square around\
  \ which the Medina (the ancient city) develops and it changes its face with the\
  \ light of day. In the morning It\u2019s a frantic beating heart. Snake charmers,\
  \ monkey masters and Mehndi (temporary henna hands decoration) tattoo artists, fought\
  \ for the attention of tourists from all over the world.\nDuring the evening the\
  \ sound of Berber music filled the air taking the place of the merchants\u2019 alluring\
  \ call. The nightlife went on in the lights of the shops, which were still open\
  \ along the perimeter of the square.\nIn the distance the majestic and magnetic\
  \ Koutoubia Mosque could be seen from there, and it looked like fairy-tale castle.\n\
  People smiled in every street and along the Souks, and tried to welcome me in various\
  \ languages, trying to understand where I\u2019d came from.\nThey called for my\
  \ attention shouting in French, German and Spanish, but they were able to grasp\
  \ my origins as soon as they shifted to Italian \u2013 they may have caught a fleeting\
  \ glimpse in my eyes.\n\nMy riad was just a few steps away from the chaotic old\
  \ town and it was possible to listen to the Adh\xE0n at night, the Islamic call\
  \ to prayer. \nI had an initial moment of uneasiness at first, especially because\
  \ of the unexpected metallic voice that spread from nearby loudspeakers, which showed\
  \ up in every corner, creating an absolute almost unnatural silence throughout the\
  \ city. However, soon after that I could appreciate the incredible unifying force\
  \ it conveyed. It lulled me to sleep, like a mantra."
