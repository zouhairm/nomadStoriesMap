Text: "That's what my dear friend Kath always use to say. I always thought she was\
  \ a bit too optimistic until my journey in India. I am a true skeptical person.\
  \ Even though I did artistic studies and am into spiritual practices, sometimes,\
  \ it's hard for me to believe and trust. During my solo trip to India, I learned\
  \ to trust that life will provide what I need.  \nI went to India for a wedding.\
  \ I clearly remember myself saying, as a joke, to Sujata that the only reason which\
  \ would make visit India would be to attend her wedding. Two years later, she invites\
  \ me to her Indian wedding. I took it as a sign from the universe and decided to\
  \ go. After 3 amazing days, diving into Indian culture, I thought I was ready to\
  \ be confronted to real India. I left the resort with 3 other guests to go to Jodhpur.\
  \ But when the taxi driver dropped us next to the market, I literally freaked out.\
  \ All this chaos... From far as I remember, it's the first time I felt so panicked\
  \ in a foreign country. \nIt's a very strange sensation to be alone in a place where\
  \ everything is different from where you live. It was my very first steps in the\
  \ Asian continent. Even though I am used to travel a lot, and it wasn't my first\
  \ trip on my own (though it was the first of 3 weeks long), I was feeling slightly\
  \ overwhelmed by this new environnement, not knowing what or who to trust. Specially,\
  \ when, as a woman, I'd been very much warned by my friends before going. Some people\
  \ even said I was crazy to go there alone...\nAfter some days in Jodhpur and Goa,\
  \ I was about to take a bus night bus to go to Hampi. After a long talk with the\
  \ tuk tuk driver, we finally agreed on a price and he took me to the bus stop. When\
  \ I say \"bus stop\" it's more a way of talking than a truthful description of the\
  \ reality. As a matter of fact, he left me in the middle of nowhere, yelling \"\
  stay there!\". I didn't know how long it would take me to find a tuk tuk driver\
  \ and, because it was way quicker than expected, I had a long time to wait before\
  \ the bus would pass. I was in a very bustling area, not welcoming at all, one of\
  \ the only woman outside and for sure the only foreign white woman. I felt so exposed\
  \ and unsafe, that I thought I should go inside a place (any place) and stay there\
  \ until my bus arrives. The problem was there wasn't any place where it feels OK\
  \ for a woman to go and have a tcha\xEF tea. I still chose one and stayed for a\
  \ while, until the owner kicked me out because I was not spending enough. I had\
  \ to go back to the bus stop. This is when the magic happened. When I arrived back\
  \ to this unsafe place, some people were there too. And this is how I met Arpan,\
  \ a young Indian who was visiting his family during holidays. As a very well educated\
  \ Indian man, Arpan felt the duty to take care of me (he probably felt my distress).\
  \ He helped me to find proper restrooms because he didn't want me to go to any random\
  \ ones. We ended in the bar of a small hotel chatting about our cultural differences\
  \ and our respective lives. \nI know it seems a bit exaggerated, but I really saw\
  \ Arpan as a bless and a life saver. It seemed that universe heard my priors and\
  \ put this person on my way. We stayed in touch during all the rest of my trip and\
  \ helped me giving me tips and infos. Today still I am very grateful for this encounter\
  \ and know now, that if you wish it strong enough, the universe will provide..."
