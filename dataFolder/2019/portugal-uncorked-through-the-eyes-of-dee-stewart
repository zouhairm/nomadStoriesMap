Text: In less than 6 months I will alongside my husband become an empty nester. One
  of the most relevant and important things I took pride in was finding adventures
  to take my family on... Whether a local trip around the corner or an unexpected
  trip abroad, my life was centered around creating family memoirs. Coming up with
  experiences for my family meant everything to me, and so it is for every mother.
  For me traveling is something I always wanted to do, and writing is something I
  just always had a knack for. I can't help but write from the heart, I can't help
  but share my passion for creating adventures for our family, memories for a lifetime.
  Naturally everyone cannot afford to do and go as they would like, nor does anyone
  seem to have the time to look or research  those unexpected, delightful hidden secrets
  around the world. I would love the opportunity to be that spokesperson for these
  rare beautiful places and experiences, food and fun, through my writing that families
  can learn about and consider for their own crew. These excursions and time of exploration
  I can bring to the world for all families not just mine own... Especially now that
  I will soon have the time.
