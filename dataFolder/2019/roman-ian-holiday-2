Text: "My friend Maria, my sister and I had spent several months dreaming up a European\
  \ holiday for the summer of 2014, focusing primarily on destinations where we could\
  \ couchsurf to make the most of our budgets.  Though Maria\u2019s parents had immigrated\
  \ to America after the fall of Ceau\u0219escu, both sets of her grandparents remained\
  \ rooted in Romania, and she suggested that we start there.\n \nHad it not been\
  \ for Maria\u2019s heritage, I likely never would have visited Romania.  My impression\
  \ of the country was a nebulous caricature at best, conjuring clich\xE9s of Vlad\
  \ the Impaler, vampires and gypsies. Eastern Europe was entirely alien to me, and\
  \ I was intrigued and excited for the opportunity to experience the culture through\
  \ a more intimate lens.\n \nDespite the late hour of our arrival, Maria\u2019s grandparents\
  \ greeted us warmly at their home in Bucharest.  A basket of fresh bread laid on\
  \ the table waiting for us, accompanied by a plate of house cured meats, slices\
  \ of homegrown tomatoes, and telemea, a soft, tangy cheese similar to feta.  I stood\
  \ observing the scene, entranced by the old world feel of it all.  Bookshelves lined\
  \ with delicate china, old university textbooks, portraits of loved ones and other\
  \ enchanting miscellanea.  Framed Eastern Orthodox icons rested on bedside tables,\
  \ painted in the austere, flattened Byzantine style, old wedding crowns hung on\
  \ the corners of the frame, their former emerald leaves now crisp and curled into\
  \ the palest mint over time.  \nWe ate dinner in their garden every night, underneath\
  \ the canopied trellis of grapevines in the backyard, rimmed by hydrangea bushes,\
  \ roses and tomato plants.  Most meals were composed of small plates served family\
  \ style\u2014platters of chiftele accompanied by a pungent, singeing mustard, dolmas,\
  \ zesty homemade pickles, fresh cherry tomatoes from the garden, and salata de vinete,\
  \ baba ghanoush\u2019s Romanian relative.\n \nEvery meal was served with a shot\
  \ of a plum moonshine called \u021Auic\u0103 , ubiquitous and sacred in Romanian\
  \ households.  My sister and I would psych ourselves up to knock back the potent\
  \ sample, our gracious hosts refilling our shot glasses as soon as we set them down.\
  \ Resigned to our fate, we\u2019d sink successive rounds of stonefruit swill out\
  \ of courtesy, catching each other\u2019s pleading eyes in the process.  Our first\
  \ few days in Bucharest we wound up unintentionally drunk by the end of breakfast,\
  \ in awe of the Romanian tolerance.  A few days later Maria laughingly explained\
  \ that it was meant to be sipped throughout the meal, rather than pounded down in\
  \ one fell swoop.  It was one of those ironic cultural crossed wires\u2014while\
  \ we\u2019d been stomaching the shots in what we thought was a gesture of gratitude\
  \ to our hosts, her grandparents were apparently surprised by our habits, thinking\
  \ us a pair of American alcoholics.\n \nAndrei, our chauffeur and guide, was a sweet\
  \ but nervous fellow; over long drives through the Romanian countryside, he would\
  \ tell us stories about day-to-day life under communist rule.  As we cruised down\
  \ cypress-lined highways, he shared stories of friends and family that had gone\
  \ missing, their remains discovered later in shallow unmarked graves a few towns\
  \ over.  He spoke of the injustices of collectivism, the scarcity of food.  His\
  \ father was a farmer and once hid a fatted calf for a neighbor\u2019s wedding feast.\
  \  He learned his lesson, Andrei said\u2014a few days later his father disappeared,\
  \ resurfacing three days after, beaten and bloody.\n\nThe countries that followed\
  \ were lovely as well, Germany, Austria and France being traditionally popular vacation\
  \ spots.  But something about the first leg of that trip stuck with me, perhaps\
  \ because it was so different from anything I had experienced before. More unpredictable,\
  \ less sanitized than democratic, occidental society.  The loosely maintained anarchy,\
  \ wild dogs running amok in the streets, bands of gypsies selling home-made wine\
  \ on the side of the road, mingled with the charms of the Carpathian region with\
  \ its thatched roofs and village women wearing traditional \u0218tergar head coverings.\
  \  Hearing firsthand accounts about life during communism and seeing the ugly effects\
  \ of its aftermath, making one appreciate the sociopolitical freedoms that are so\
  \ often taken for granted.  To this day, it remains one of my more intriguing travel\
  \ experiences."
