Text: "I was always an introvert and shy, old school girl. Last three months ago,\
  \ my parents forced me to go and explore a city of excitement and full of surprises,\
  \ Goa. I was accompanied by my cousin sister. I went to Mumbai from Prayagraj and\
  \ for the first time, I was traveling alone. After reaching Mumbai, I took a train\
  \ and reached Karmali Railway Station in Goa. My heart was beating rapidly. I was\
  \ going to unknown place for the first time without \nmy parents. At station my\
  \ cousin sister was waiting for me. Hola! Finally I completed the harculean task.\
  \ Then our exploration was started. We went to Mandrem by taxi, where we stayed\
  \ for 4 days and 3 nights. Locals are amazing and helpful. We went to different\
  \ beaches, meeting strangers and doing all those things which I was always afraid\
  \ of. I was enjoying my own self. Life is about to explore and I was exploring my\
  \ own self's island (the core of my heart). Both of us started our scooty and without\
  \ navigation we were riding on the roads of Goa. We went there to lost. Hahaha I\
  \ was always a good and obedient child and only focused to study but in Goa, I realized\
  \ that there is much to explore in this world. On the eve of 25th, the roads were\
  \ glittering with the sparkling lights of cafes and pubs. I entered first time in\
  \ Pub Life and it was beyond the awesomeness. I danced till 3 a.m and hogging a\
  \ lot of sea food. My favorite things in Goa memories the sea food, Goan cuisine\
  \ and serene beaches. Most pleasant and serene beach in Goa is Mandrem Beach and\
  \ Candolim Beach. Baga Beach is the centre of attraction for all the people but\
  \ for me its too crowded and dirty. No toilets and changing room are available there,\
  \ So for ladies, its a big prob!\nIn Mandrem, we made Russian friends in a cafe.\
  \ We spent our last night with them with great food and Russian music. The must\
  \ visit places are Bom Basaillica of Jesus Church, Baga Beach, Agoda  Fort, Archeology\
  \ Survey of India, Tito's Caf\xE8 and Britto Caf\xE8. Finallyy come to go back to\
  \ the real world. Ah! for me it was like a dream. I enjoyed every single moment,\
  \ breaking my own rules and living wholly. I made good friends over there and unforgettable\
  \ memories. That trip imprinted its image in my heart and mind. And I just remind\
  \ a great line written by an author about Goa which is Goa is Rose and Rose is Goa.\
  \ I miss you Goa! And I will come back soon."
