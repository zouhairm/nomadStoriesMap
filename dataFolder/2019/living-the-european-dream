Text: "I had planned a trip to Europe in June last year n was desperate to see the\
  \ beauty n architecture of Italy and Vatican City and my boyfriend wanted to visit\
  \ Amsterdam. We checked for the best flights available and had to add Paris as one\
  \ of our travel destinations because our return flight was from Paris.\nWe weren't\
  \ keen on visiting the place as we had read a lot of stories about the place and\
  \ the unpleasant experience the other tourists had whilst visiting the city.\nUpon\
  \ our arrival in the beautiful city of Paris, we fell in love with the place as\
  \ soon as we arrived.\nThere is definitely something magical about the place, the\
  \ romance is in the air. We checked-in to our hotel and couldn't wait to move out\
  \ to explore the city. We kept our bags, changed our clothes and immediately rushed\
  \ out. We were in awe of that place. It's amazing architecture, there was serenity\
  \ everywhere. Our tour to visit the majestic Eiffel tower was planned for the next\
  \ day but we couldn't wait till tomorrow n decided to visit it the very day we had\
  \ arrived.\nMy boyfriend is someone who just cannot wait in queues but he developed\
  \ patience all of a sudden and stood in the long queue to see one of the wonders\
  \ of the world. Once we reached the top floor of the tower after waiting for hours\
  \ for our turn, we got to experience the breathtaking views of the city.\nMy boyfriend,\
  \ became all the more romantic and saw a new side of him which I had not seen before.\n\
  The next day we visited the tower again and took the city tour to visit the world's\
  \ largest art museum, the Louvre. The architecture in Paris is commendable n cannot\
  \ be compared to it's neighbouring countries.\nNo wonder it's called the city of\
  \ love as I found the people pretty friendly unlike the reviews I had read about\
  \ them being rude. The weather during the summer season is perfect which adds to\
  \ the charm of the city. \nThis place came as a complete surprise for us and I want\
  \ to travel to this place again."
