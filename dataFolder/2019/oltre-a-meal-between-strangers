Text: "It was 2014, and I was alone in the world. I had arrived in Bologna for my\
  \ exchange semester, 16,000 kilometers away from family, friends, and my long-term\
  \ boyfriend Davis, who had cried all the way to the airport. I didn't have a place\
  \ to live, my suitcase weighed more than I did, and I was absolutely starving. Wandering\
  \ into the hostel kitchen, I was greeted by two girls, Canadian and Swedish, who\
  \ were heading out together for a meal. After a quick chat, they graciously asked\
  \ me to join, and we stumbled out into the Via San Felice, the late summer sun still\
  \ high and bright.\n\nAs students, we were none of us very well off, but it was\
  \ one of those evenings where money did not feel like an object. We were enticed\
  \ into a small upmarket osteria called Oltre - an Italian word meaning above, over,\
  \ more than \u2013 which claimed to showcase the best of Emilia-Romagnan cuisine.\
  \ We were the only ones inside, as it was far too early in the evening for any real\
  \ Italians to be eating. As such, we were truly spoilt in having the doting waiter\
  \ and chef all to ourselves, as they took pride in explaining each of the dishes\
  \ and its origins, and providing delicious recommendations. By the end of the meal\
  \ \u2013 passatelli and vino rosso for me \u2013 I had learnt all about Claire\u2019\
  s family dramas, and how Mathilde\u2019s passion for human rights law almost equalled\
  \ that for her long term violinist boyfriend. \nThe waiter, at this point, had sat\
  \ down with us at the table, and we were shortly joined by the chef, along with\
  \ bottle of homemade limoncello from the freezer. We spent the next hour or so taking\
  \ shots of the sweet liqueur while the chef told us about growing up in Sicily,\
  \ before saying goodbye \u2013 still in broken English \u2013 and paying the bill.\
  \ Talk about customer service \u2018\u201COltre\u201D al normale\u2019! \n\nThe\
  \ next day I found a place to stay and moved out of the hostel, and never saw Claire\
  \ or Mathilde again. But there was nevertheless something magical about the balm\
  \ of a good meal with kind people on a sunny evening, and Bologna no longer felt\
  \ so vast and friendless. It was 2014, but I was not alone, but ready to take on\
  \ the world."
