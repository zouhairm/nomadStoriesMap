Text: "I always wanted to feel what it\u2019d be like to sail and make landfall on\
  \ a desolated sand beach in the middle of the ocean. After extensive research, I\
  \ was able to find a very affordable package that consisted of island hopping in\
  \ the West Indies on a 58\u2019 IPanema Catamaran with a Captain and a Chef! Why\
  \ wait, right? Besides, the Caribbean sun never disappoints.  \n\nWe paid a little\
  \ under 4K for a cabin with a bathroom, all meals included.  Another perk is that\
  \ you don\u2019t need to pack much, you can be in a swimsuit all day long and shoes\
  \ are not allowed in the Catamaran. You just need your pjs, sandals, clothing to\
  \ get back and personal items.\n\nOur Journey started by arriving in Grenada on\
  \ a Sunday and a magnificent sunlight awaited us. Coming from the cold Northeastern\
  \ winter to a balmy 87 degrees, it was definitely a warming welcome. The heat was\
  \ strong but the breeze was stronger; this part of the Caribbean is well known for\
  \ its winds.\n\nOur first stop was the island of Carriacou. The tidal current and\
  \ wind were strong but still enjoyable.  As we took a walk through the small city\
  \ of eight thousand habitants, the unhurried way of life was enviable.\n\nWe stopped\
  \ at Sandy Island, where we anchored at sea for the night.  This island was tiny\
  \ but very charming, and a nice place to watch the sunset. Every time we walked\
  \ into these little towns, we felt for the most part safe. There was poverty for\
  \ sure, but these towns depend so much on tourism that the local authorities make\
  \ sure the tourists have a good visit. Most locals are also super friendly.\n\n\
  The following day, we went to the island of Union in the country of St.Vincent.\
  \ In the downtown of this small island there was a very colorful market. We tried\
  \ some fresh smoothies and a fruit called Golden Apple, which ironically did not\
  \ look like an apple and tasted like a mango. Then we went to Palm island, which\
  \ is surrounded by a huge coral reef. In every stop we had plenty time for snorkeling\
  \ and were able to swim with turtles and fishes! I am not always comfortable with\
  \ the ocean. Sometimes I feel like I an intruder when I see so many aquatic animals.\
  \ I am also a little scared of sharks, but to live life fully, we need to take risks,\
  \ and I am all up for the challenge.\n\nThen, we traveled to a very small island\
  \ called Mayreau. We walked to the top of the hill where the view of Tobago Cays\
  \ was mesmerizing.\n\nOn Thursday we went to Tobago Cays, where five small islands\
  \ are lost in a mass of corals. The clear waters with tons of fish and sea turtles\
  \ made our journey unforgettable.\n\nThen, a small boat picked us back up and took\
  \ us to Petite Tabac, where some scenes of Pirates of Caribbean were filmed. This\
  \ isolated island is known as the world\u2019s end reef, because it\u2019s lost\
  \ in the middle of the Caribbean and Atlantic swells. \n\nOn Friday we stopped at\
  \ very little sand islet in the middle of the ocean, called Morpion. This islet\
  \ had a thatched umbrella set up, and it was a very convenient place to take pictures\
  \ from and to rest in the shade. We then sailed to Petit St-Vincent, which was an\
  \ attractive island of two small hills, with a large barrier reef and a nice beach.\
  \ \n\nOn Saturday, we sailed for around 6 hours back to Grenada. We stopped at Dragon\
  \ Bay where you can swim and see some concrete statues under the sea. \n\nThe entire\
  \ trip was filled with stunning ocean views and nature. I can now say I have swum\
  \ with turtles, which were gorgeous to look at. Most meals were very tasty and healthy.\
  \ There was a lot of time for relaxing, reading and writing. The memories of our\
  \ landfall on some desolates sand beaches in the middle of the ocean, will be stocked\
  \ in my mind for life. If it\u2019s not already, sailing in a Catamaran should be\
  \ on your bucket list. It\u2019s worth it!"
