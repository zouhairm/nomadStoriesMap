Text: "Two of the towns we (a couple of couples) visited in Uttrakhand, both happened\
  \ to be our random trips. The trips we just took because we were so tired and needed\
  \ a break and needed to get ourselves relaxed. First one was in the year 2015. We\
  \ were just sitting, sipping some alcohol abd it occured to us to take a trip. As\
  \ we stay in Delhi NCR so Shimla Dehradun were the best options for us but did not\
  \ to go there and just wander on Mall road and see a lot of tourists and lot of\
  \ traffic instead of beauty. So, we just googled and saw Kausani which is not so\
  \ much visited. We just booked a hotel overnight and left and drove to the place.\n\
  Oh My God! So beautiful, these were our firstt words. Why havenot we come here earlier.\
  \ And to our surprise, we got our rooms upgraded to the best ones there with biggest\
  \ balconies. It was amazing. We did not plan anything and just left after getting\
  \ freshen up and saw some amazing beautiful sceneries. We even had tea at a local's\
  \ house. They had so small yet very beautiful houses there. Its so different. They\
  \ are so hospitable. We were all wet from a dip in a sea, beautiful view(founded\
  \ randomly) and people saw us and offered tea. They even offered food, but we wanted\
  \ to explore more. I hope that place doesnot costruct more hotels and resorts as\
  \ that would definitely lower down its beauty. Next morning we woke up and went\
  \ for a morning walk(or rather climb) to an orchard where we ate fresh(oh so fresh)\
  \ fruits. It was amazing and you have to visit it on your own to see how amazing\
  \ the place is!\n\nAnother trip was to another hidden place named Chamba in Uttrakhand\
  \ in 2016. People think of only one Chamba thats in Himachal. I hope that would\
  \ be beautiful too but we went to this one, because we did not want to drive more\
  \ as i was pregnant and hoping(happily) not to get another road trip soon(which\
  \ to be true as i have not gone on a road trip since then, but will go on one soon).\n\
  And to be a surprise we did not even book any hotel prior. As we thought everything\
  \ would be vaccant as its also a not so visited place. But to our surprise, we had\
  \ difficulty finding a room as there were leser hotels and more tourists, but still\
  \ so quiet and beautiful.\nWe went on  a morning walk(here too), beautiful, purest\
  \ air, dry leaves on ground and green leaves on trees. Heavenly feeling it always\
  \ is.\nIn one evening we visited to Tehri Dam nearby, considered to be the highest\
  \ dam in India and one of the highest in World. It has a very good history and i\
  \ am not going to tell everything here, you should go on a trip there and find it\
  \ yourself.\n\nSo, here is my short story. I would like to write a long one too\
