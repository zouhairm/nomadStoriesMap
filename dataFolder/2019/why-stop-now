Text: "Waking up at 6am to the sound of a bunk bed ladder crashing to the floor wasn\u2019\
  t ideal, but honestly it seemed pretty fitting for the situation. A combination\
  \ of arriving in Madrid three days before school started along with little self-restraint\
  \ over the weekend meant I was stranded at a hostel for the start of my teaching\
  \ career. I rubbed my eyes and sat up as I threw my legs over the edge of my bunk.\
  \ What am I doing here? I thought to myself, teaching English on the other side\
  \ of the world? The answer was vague, lying somewhere between the desire to travel\
  \ and wanting to take a break from the rat-race made inevitable if you listen to\
  \ what they tell you at school and beyond. I was young, they told me, I best make\
  \ the most of it before it\u2019s too late. I jumped off my bunk and made my way\
  \ downstairs to the kitchen. Churros and coffee were on the house, a breakfast that\
  \ made me feel a little more Spanish in a hostel full of expats. As I sat around\
  \ the kitchen table, I thought about what the next 9 months held for me. Honestly,\
  \ I had no clue, something that both frightened yet excited me at the same time.\n\
  \nI thought back to that moment last night, as I braved against the piercing wind\
  \ of the Spanish night; five months had felt like yesterday. I looked across at\
  \ the Prado as I listened to the sounds of the night; the language, the atmosphere,\
  \ the broken pattern of my breathing once I realised I was listening to it. It was\
  \ not every day you could run past something so iconic. But for me, it really was\
  \ - if my body permitted that was. I ran past a restaurant, small yet lively, only\
  \ glancing at it momentarily. This was the norm in Madrid, people outside at all\
  \ hours, the conversation flowing like the taps behind the bar. I smiled as I heard\
  \ a snippet of a conversation. Something that had once sounded so foreign now had\
  \ meaning.\n\nI found myself thinking back on the places I had seen; the markets,\
  \ full of character; the parks, so enchanting. You could spend hours without realising\
  \ where the time went.  I recalled the morning of my first day of work, locked in\
  \ a losing battle against the ticket machine at the station. Admitting defeat, I\
  \ turned to the man behind me, and although the two of spoke different mother tongues,\
  \ we accomplished the goal of ensuring I wasn\u2019t late for my first day of work.\
  \ I thought about the staff, the students at school, so accommodating and friendly.\
  \ If only I could count how many \u2018hey teacher\u2019s and high-fives I got per\
  \ day. Sometimes I felt more like a student there the way they treated me. \n\n\
  And then by Thursday afternoon, I was free, free to explore the city that now felt\
  \ like home. A home I couldn\u2019t see myself leaving in four months\u2019 time,\
  \ but rather had no choice but to. How contradictory it would be of me to not follow\
  \ the advice I had been preaching to my students that change fostered growth, ideas\
  \ and the best version of yourself. I was now walking beneath the old Tobacco factory\
  \ \u2013 a reformed co-operative art-space, the walls a beautiful mess of self-expression.\
  \ Uninformed, you couldn\u2019t fathom the history of the grounds you stood on.\
  \ From providing work for over 2% of Madrid\u2019s population to being used as a\
  \ temporary base for Napoleon\u2019s army, it felt like a metaphor for the ever-changing\
  \ idea that was life.\n\nIt was now February, I found myself sitting alongside the\
  \ Templo de Debod with an old friend from Australia, the accordion faint in comparison\
  \ to the simmer of conversation. He had just finished a six month long internship\
  \ in Dubai, inciting the discussion of what was next for him, for us. What\u2019\
  s the rush to go home? We pondered briefly. There was still so much to see, to do\
  \ beyond Australia, moments that were waiting for us wherever our journeys transpired.\
  \ Well, we agreed, why does Australia have to be our only home?"
