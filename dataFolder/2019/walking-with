Text: "The church bell tolled seven as I walked through winter-stubbled fields out\
  \ of Kirk Yetholm, the small border town marking the beginning of the trail. I decided\
  \ to take it as a good omen. I was heading north \u2013 along a meandering 864 kilometre\
  \ route that would take me through farms and cities, along old drove roads and across\
  \ swollen streams, and thereby, I hoped, into the mountainous back-country of myself.\
  \ \n\nWhen you think of hiking the length of Scotland, you imagine empty hills under\
  \ granite skies with only the ghosts of ancient heroes (and sheep) for company.\
  \ I'll do away with the suspense from the outset \u2013 I didn't make it far enough\
  \ into the wilderness to discover whether or not this is ever true, as I was forced\
  \ by injury to postpone the second half of my quest. In the 250 kilometres I did\
  \ manage, though, the land was far from empty. Within a quarter of an hour of setting\
  \ out from Kirk Yetholm, I met an older man taking his dog for their morning constitutional.\
  \ He stopped me to make sure I was headed in the right direction and to marvel at\
  \ the size and violent orange hue of my pack.\n\nI walked into Peebles with a man\
  \ named Andrew who gave me a handful of instant coffee sachets, and camped in a\
  \ friendly farmer\u2019s field outside of Galashiels. In Melrose, I met a man named\
  \ Len, who accompanied me for the distance between the public toilets and the sports-field.\
  \ \"Ye gads!\", he said when I told him where I was headed, quickly followed by,\
  \ \"Gee whiz!\" He called me a hero, and pressed a pound coin into my hand. Whether\
  \ it was for luck or to pay for my ferry ride across the Styx, I wasn't certain:\
  \ for every person I met who was impressed by my endeavor, was another who was dubious.\
  \ \n\n\"All by yourself?\" I was asked, more than once. \"You're brave!\"\n\nAdventuring\
  \ alone seemed to be considered a far more perilous thing for a woman like myself\
  \ than if I had been a young man. But I refused to be cowed into believing that\
  \ I should be afraid of the world; Bilbo Baggins wasn't afraid to face dragons,\
  \ and I would not be either. \n\nOn the fourth day of walking, I pitched camp in\
  \ a field of heather at the top of the Pentland Hills above Edinburgh, in the lee\
  \ of a stone wall. I sat in the weak late-August sunshine, bundled into several\
  \ wool sweaters and a pair of thermal underwear, and listened to the croak and cackle\
  \ of frogs in the marsh to the west. The wind stroked the heather \u2013 each bush\
  \ trembling and twisting in a shivery dance. The late sun struck the strands of\
  \ spiders' webs strung between the branches, and they shimmered, white gold. \n\n\
  I awoke the next morning as the sun was rising over the ocean. The light was crystalline,\
  \ sharp, the sky shading from faded terracotta at the horizon through egg yolk yellow\
  \ to a milky blue directly above my lonely tent. This was Scotland, so, naturally,\
  \ there were a few clouds, but they were only scattered stratocumulus, blushing\
  \ the dusty pink of Turkish delight. Far below, I could make out the cantilevers\
  \ of the Forth bridge stretching away northwards. \n\nThere is a M\u0101ori proverb:\
  \ He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tangata, he tangata, he tangata. \"What is the most\
  \ important thing in the world? It is people, it is people, it is people.\" In my\
  \ attempt to walk to the end of the world, it was not only the places that were\
  \ empty of people that offered me beauty and joy; it was also the people I met,\
  \ who shared their stories, who proffered their wisdom and their doubts and their\
  \ faith, who gave me the simple gift of conversation and companionship. I set out\
  \ believing that only by losing myself alone in the wild would I find some kind\
  \ of deeper meaning. But in the end, the truth I was given was this: it is other\
  \ people, not our lonely selves, who give sense and meaning to this world."
