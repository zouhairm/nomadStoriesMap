Text: "Don't ge me wrong, I always love to travel. Its something that activate my\
  \ adrenaline response, but to work abroad for love is another story. \nIts a leap\
  \ of the unknown, its the fear of the unknown that scares me, the two words \"what\
  \ if\" eventually come up to me. And yes, I made it and thats the best thing happened\
  \ to me so far, I move out in a foreign country I least expect me to be where different\
  \ cultures I met, I've learn a lot and still learning. And I could say, I travel\
  \ for love because I love myself so much that I wanted her to explore and see life\
  \ in a different level. I love how I am expose and will certainly not limit my potentials\
  \ or opportunities for growth. As individual, traveling is a food for soul, it nourish\
  \ us our minds, our soul only for us to realize we are too tiny in this world, and\
  \ has given one life, one chance to explore and see the potentials of humans and\
  \ the only way to find it out is to travel. Right now, I am working abroad in Dubai\
  \ and this is my starting point of achieving my dreams, lets see where it would\
  \ take me,"
