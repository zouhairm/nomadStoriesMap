Text: "I found myself with a free long weekend in the midst of gray and chilly early\
  \ spring in northeast France, craving for Vitamin D, warmth, the magnificent ocean\
  \ views, and culturally diverse cuisine.  Through ease of accessibility and affordability\
  \ from discounted airlines, I found direct flights at bargain prices to Portugal's\
  \ second largest city, Porto, which conveniently fit my pre-requisite wanderlust\
  \ list. \n\nBeing such a short trip, I knew I needed to make local connections quickly\
  \ to receive authentic suggestions and experiences in the bright, colorful, and\
  \ historical city. To resolve the issue of not actually knowing any locals, I decided\
  \ to take the free walking tour presented by Porto natives. \n \nI can\u2019t recommend\
  \ enough taking this free 4 hour walking tour with a passionate local from Porto\
  \ Walkers (Do this!) I learned so much from history to unknown eateries that are\
  \ top picks of locals and not tourists. The most authentic experience of having\
  \ a native Porto guide was his storytelling and how he provided us with current\
  \ day appreciation for tourists and at the same time the unfortunate reality of\
  \ class and economic rapid changes due to the influx of recent tourism. This eye\
  \ opening, other side of the coin lesson left me shocked but further educated and\
  \ I felt it necessary to share a few important points\u2026\n\n1. Porto\u2019s tourism\
  \ is relatively new (think 15-20 years new). Thanks to UNESCO declaring the historical\
  \ center of Oporto as a World Heritage Site and the influx of additional budgeted\
  \ flights like RyanAir, the city has seen a large growth in visitors and most of\
  \ the locals are appreciative for the economic boost but\u2026\n\n2. In the underprivileged\
  \ sections of town, where the buildings create narrow, quaint winding, colorful,\
  \ clothes-lined drying alleys, some families monthly wage is 500\u20AC. Once upon\
  \ a time there were laws to protect the impoverished, where monthly rent was grandfathered\
  \ over year after year to keep prices low to protect them from losing their homes.\
  \ Due to greed and a change in law, rents have skyrocketed from 50\u20AC per month\
  \ to 800\u20AC per month, to create Airbnb\u2019s for tourists like myself. This\
  \ results lead to these families financially suffering and often, ultimately leaving\
  \ them homeless.\n\n3. Here\u2019s what we can do to help: Do not rent Airbnb\u2019\
  s within the Riberia district (Old Town) or support the overpriced, tourist restaurants\
  \ and shops along the Douro river front. Do eat at local Portuguese restaurants\
  \ and shop off the typical tourist beaten paths. You will know the difference immediately\
  \ because there will probably be a wait to get in because they are small and the\
  \ prices will be extraordinarily less expensive.\n\nBecause of my chance to meet\
  \ and learn from a local, I hope to pass on my more intimate adventure in Porto\
  \ and pass this knowledge onto you. I hope you all get a chance to visit and take\
  \ into account the need to respect their culture, heritage, and people. And drink\
  \ all the port wine! If you are waiting for a reason to go see this beautiful, eclectic\
  \ city, the weekend of June 23rd is a huge street party for festival of Saint John\
  \ (Sao Joao). A celebration with locals and tourists alike using toy plastic hammers\
  \ and of course an excuse to drink, dance, and see a fantastic fireworks display.\
  \ This is certainly not a celebration to be missed."
