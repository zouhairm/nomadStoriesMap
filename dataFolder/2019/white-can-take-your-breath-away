Text: "We were walking one behind the other and together we formed a serpentine wavy\
  \ trail. We took a turn and all of a sudden there was a soft cry. We got to see\
  \ clear distinct foot prints of animal leading to mountains where we could see huge\
  \ gathering of birds in the air, mostly choughs but few could be vultures. What\
  \ did we just see? Were these footprints of snow leopard? Has the hidden / residual\
  \ kill been found by birds and are thus so many of them at one place? The thought\
  \ made me shiver with excitement. \n\nIt was our typical day from a frozen river\
  \ trek in Zanskar region of Himalayas.  Our surrounding was full of different shades\
  \ of white with a tinge of blue. The flowing part river was turquoise, the sky was\
  \ blue, the path on frozen river, mountain top and slopes on both sides was milky\
  \ white due to fresh snowfall from night before. It was surreal, beautiful, out\
  \ of the world experience. But it was dangerous too. We survived the temperatures\
  \ ranging from minus 15 to minus 30 degrees Celcius. Extreme weather conditions\
  \ coupled with altitude, makes it is very common for trekkers to fall prey to AMS.\
  \ A slight change in the temperature has a huge impact on Chadar. Ice forms, breaks,\
  \ and melts throughout the day. There is just no way of knowing what kind of terrrain\
  \ lies ahead of you. The walk  ice could lead to falls causing you bone fracture\
  \ and worse could be falling in the water below which could cause hypothermia. But\
  \ real life begins at the end of your comfort zone. \n\nWhile I am marathon runner\
  \ and have run \u2018Khardung La\u2019 challenge an ultra-marathon of 72km on highest\
  \ motorable road on earth passing through an altitude of 5359m (which is another\
  \ story altogether), that was during Summer and weather was more or less pleasant.\
  \ It was during that trip I got to know about \u2018Chadar trek\u2019. It is a trek\
  \ on frozen \u2018Zanskar\u2019 river. Coming from Western India where winter lasts\
  \ for couple of months and average temperatures is around 10 degrees Celsius, it\
  \ was unthinkable of me to do a Himalayan winter trek. But as they say life begins\
  \ at the end of your comfort zone. \n\nDuring winter, \u2018Zanskar\u2019 river\
  \ freezes and sheet of ice (called as Chadar in local language) is formed. It becomes\
  \ very difficult to commute on hilly roads due to heavy snowfall. The frozen river\
  \ becomes the shortest route to Leh from Zanskar valley. Natives use this route\
  \ for trading, to sell stuff like goatskin, Yak butter etc. and buy their supplies.\
  \ The frozen river becomes a lifeline of the Zanskar valley. This was discovered\
  \ by some tourists and soon a trek route was formed.\n\nI happened to go for this\
  \ trek during the month of February this year. We arrived at Leh with outside temperature,\
  \ minus 12 degrees Celcius. We had to stay at Leh for couple of days for acclimatization\
  \ and medical checkup and insurance for the trek. Our actual trek started only after\
  \ that. After travelling by mini-bus till the start point of the trek, being first\
  \ day, we had to walk only about 3 to 4 kms on ice. It was little tough to get used\
  \ to walking on ice. Thankfully the ice formation was thick and there was no fear\
  \ of cracking of ice and falling in to water below. There was no summit in this\
  \ trek, the aim was to reach till pace called Nerak where one gets to see frozen\
  \ waterfall. I could not even imagine the exact point in time when and how this\
  \ must have happened. The nature is truly amazing. On your way back, there could\
  \ be instances when formation of Chadar no longer exists or a new layer of Chadar\
  \ formed or fresh snowfall covers the entire path. Even though it's the same route,\
  \ you'll be amazed to see how different it appears while coming back. Our entire\
  \ batch finished the entire trek without any mishaps.\n\nIt indeed in once in lifetime\
  \ experience and a must to do before you die."
