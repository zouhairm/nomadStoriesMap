Text: "Have you ever traveled alone without a plan? It was supposed to be my first\
  \ trip abroad with the company of my friends and acquaintances. Shortly before that,\
  \ we bought one-way bus tickets from St. Petersburg to Tallinn, and agreed to act\
  \ according to circumstances for further movement. However, due to unforeseen circumstances,\
  \ all our company quarreled the night before leaving, and nobody wanted to travel\
  \ together anymore. I was very upset. I have been waiting for this trip with such\
  \ impatience, my expectations had been ruined and I had nothing to do in the city\
  \ during the summer.  Then, without hesitation, I packed up my clothes and went\
  \ to the bus station early in the morning.\nCan you imagine my feelings? I was a\
  \ first-year student that decided to go alone from Russia to Europe for the first\
  \ time, absolutely without having an action plan, and one that possess a little\
  \ amount of money in her pocket. I was overwhelmed with a whole gradient of emotions\
  \ from fear to delight, and I literally could not sit in my place on the bus. Regardless\
  \ of everything, I was determined to spend two weeks of my vacation in Europe, and\
  \ I could not even imagine what adventures would await me.\nOn the bus, I firstly\
  \ booked a place for the night at the hostel and started to look for the cheapest\
  \ tickets to other cities. I did not notice how time had flown by, and I found myself\
  \ in Tallinn. I could not stop looking around and explore the city after I took\
  \ off from the bus. Before I knew it, the day was gone and I felt very tired, since\
  \ I was carrying my own backpack all day. I got to the hostel almost at night and\
  \ immediately fell asleep, from an overabundance of physical and emotional activity.\n\
  The next day I decided that I would spend another couple of days in Tallinn, I would\
  \ look around, and then I would go to Riga. On the same day, while walking around\
  \ the city, I met my future fianc\xE9 (but this is another story), and in the evening\
  \ I met a company of two Americans and a girl from China. After talking, they invited\
  \ me to join their company, and I agreed. The next morning, we all went on a ferry\
  \ to Helsinki.\nFrom that evening during our journey we were an inseparable company,\
  \ bound by the fate of lonely wanderers. We walked, talked, shared the history of\
  \ our countries, learned the culture of locals and each other. A day later we returned\
  \ back to Tallinn, then continued to travel together to Riga and Vilnius. In each\
  \ city we spent three or four days without making any plans, used as much time as\
  \ needed for sightseeing and trips to the nearest settlements.\nAt the end of it\
  \ all I was sorry to leave my new acquaintances, because after two weeks of traveling,\
  \ we practically became a family to each other. We spent almost every minute together\
  \ and sharing all our experiences. However, everyone had to go back home, and, promising\
  \ each other to meet somewhere by the same company, we departed.\nThis trip literally\
  \ turned around my life and opened my eyes to a new world. For the first time I\
  \ stopped being afraid of other cultures and countries, to remain and live alone\
  \ among strangers. I fell in love with the spirit of freedom and independence, as\
  \ well as I now have the desire to learn foreign languages. Three years have passed\
  \ since then, and I continue to travel, discovering new countries all around the\
  \ world."
