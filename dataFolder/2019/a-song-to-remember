Text: "Mark leans over the well. We are all sitting in silence in the dark, while\
  \ he is telling us of the origins of various Irish superstitions. He\u2019s quite\
  \ the entertainer, the kind of person who always seems excited and his child-like\
  \ enthusiasm is quickly spreading through everyone it the room. He waves his hands\
  \ around his head, his voice is constantly changing its tone as the words rush through\
  \ his mouth \u2013 he\u2019s the living embodiment of a person who is not only loving\
  \ his job, but puts his soul in it. \n\nWe\u2019ve been putting The National Leprechaun\
  \ Museum for later since we first set our feet on Irish land. Earlier this day,\
  \ as we were passing through it, we still weren\u2019t entirely sure if we should\
  \ enter. Mark saw and greeted us. He is exactly the sort of short, glasses-wearing,\
  \ already-balding, already-aging man that you could easily overlook in a crowd,\
  \ but as soon as he starts talking he has you on his side. He informed us that he\
  \ personally will lead the tour which doesn\u2019t happen often these days (he was\
  \ one of the founders of the museum as we later learnt) and we were easily persuaded\
  \ that the experience would be funny and interesting.\n\nNow, as we are sitting,\
  \ listening to his stories, we all know that we are in the last room of the museum;\
  \ the end of our tour is near. There are eleven or twelve people in that room; we\u2019\
  re resting on log seats, our heads turned into the same direction. The light coming\
  \ from the well is green. It illuminates Mark\u2019s face and distorting his features,\
  \ creating otherworldly atmosphere around him. The whole scene fits perfectly with\
  \ the themes of his mythical fables. For a very brief time he manages to take us\
  \ to a land of forgotten wanders, where anything could happen to you if you\u2019\
  re not careful and respectful to the ancient creature that are already living there.\
  \  \n\nHe tells us about the stories he heard as a child and a song his mother used\
  \ to sing to him. \n\n \u201CI don\u2019t normally do this\u201D, he says. \u201C\
  But today I feel like doing it.\u201D\n\nAnd then he does. He starts singing a song\
  \ about love and loss; an old song with even older lyrics. Its gentle and melancholic\
  \ melody evokes sadness for the heartbroken man who wrote it. We all listen carefully.\
  \ Mark\u2019s voice is raw and powerful, and it doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019\
  s a good singer, it doesn\u2019t matter at all. \n\nSuddenly, there are decades\
  \ of heartache locked in the words, we hear millions of lonely souls lament the\
  \ death of their hopes. The creatures that we were so jokingly discussing only few\
  \ moments before are sitting around us, listening to the old, old song and the man\
  \ who is dedicating his life to tell their tale to the world. \n\nMark\u2019s performance\
  \ lasts for two minutes, maybe less. But its magical integrity is so powerful that\
  \ it leaves us speechless and a little heartbroken too. He is very humble and tries\
  \ to brush off the compliments with the same cheerfulness as before, but something\
  \ in the overall mood has changed \u2013 we all know we\u2019ve witness something\
  \ genuine and beautiful. I know there are tears in my eyes and I try to wipe them\
  \ before anyone could notice. \u201CThis is the last place I thought I could cry\u201D\
  , I tell myself while we are headed to the exits. \n\nBut I did though. \n\nBecause\
  \ I never really expected to find the soul of the place I visit in something so\
  \ small as a song. Now I know better."
