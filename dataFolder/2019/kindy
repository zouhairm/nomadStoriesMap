Text: "Lisa Rosenblum- [email\_protected]\n\nKindy\n\nI\u2019ve been single during\
  \ all of my travels- joking to my parents that maybe I\u2019ll meet the love of\
  \ my life with a shared passion for adventure while on the road just like in \u201C\
  Eat, Pray, Love.\u201D After 4 months of traveling through NYC to Hawaii, onto NZ\
  \ before touchdown in Australia- I did find love...on a remote island. Kangaroo\
  \ Island, to be exact- with a kangaroo named Kindy.\n\nThe family I babysat for\
  \ while I was on Kangaroo Island for 2 weeks found Kindy as an orphan in his mom\u2019\
  s pouch as his mama \u2018roo was hit on the side of the road. Unfortunately a lot\
  \ of kangaroos are found in Australia like this as roadkill, since they hop around\
  \ and are most active at night. This fourth generation Kangaroo Island family were\
  \ on their way to kindergarten or \u201Ckindy\u201D (as aussies tend to abbreviate\
  \ most words) when they rescued him. Baby kangaroos require a lot of care just like\
  \ human babies; they need 5 bottles a day of a mixed formula. \u201CLisa, do you\
  \ want to help feed Kindy?\u201D Excited by the opportunity to have this rare chance\
  \ to give a bottle to a baby kangaroo, I replied, \u201CIs that a real question?\u201D\
  . So now my role in the household was caring for 3 humans under the age of 5 and\
  \ 1 kangaroo under 6 months old. Now, I may be biased, but Kindy was one of the\
  \ cutest kangaroos I\u2019ve ever seen- he would hop towards me on his little back\
  \ legs, reach out his tiny front arms towards the bottle, stare into my eyes with\
  \ his big eyelashes blinking at me while taking long slurps of milk which caused\
  \ his front lip to split away to reveal his cute little \u2018roo teeth.\n\nOne\
  \ evening I was going for a long walk, singing out loud to my music through the\
  \ eucalyptus trees and sheep grazing. The sun was setting in the long interrupted\
  \ sky that was so different from the skyline I was used to back home in downtown\
  \ Manhattan. I heard a thumping behind me and sure enough Kindy was trailing behind\
  \ me.\n Here I was in Australia, on a solo jaunt, and a baby kangaroo is following\
  \ me... I bend down to get to down to his level so I can take a selfie and a video\
  \ of him hopping behind me. \u201CHey Kindy boy, are you chasing me?\u201D I say\
  \ to him laughing in the video and he silently answers by coming up close to me,\
  \ nuzzling his face in my hair and gives me kangaroo kisses. Now, I\u2019ve always\
  \ been a sucker for some TLC- puppy cuddles, being the little spooon... But trust\
  \ me when I say, you haven\u2019t felt affection until you\u2019ve experienced getting\
  \ smooches from a kangaroo.\n They say that Australia is the deadliest place on\
  \ Earth- well if I had died right then and there in the bush, I would\u2019ve died\
  \ a happy girl in that moment.\n\nSo while my twenty-something year old friends\
  \ were getting engaged and starting their families back home, I was raising an orphan\
  \ kangaroo and finding a new love for a species that can only be found \u201Cdown\
  \ unda\u201D. Fascinated by this animal that can only be found in this part of the\
  \ world, I started asking a lot of questions about these unique animals. As a female,\
  \ I found it really interesting that kangaroos can be pregnant with 3 different\
  \ joeys at once and have adapted to long bushland droughts by being able to prolong\
  \ a pregnancy for up to a year! Wowza- talk about strong female role models.\n\n\
  So while I still may not have a boyfriend waiting for me to return from my travels,\
  \ I do now have a kangaroo son/mate/bf/pet in Australia...and THAT makes me feel\
  \ like the luckiest girl in the world ;)"
