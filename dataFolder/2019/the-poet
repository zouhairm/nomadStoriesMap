Text: "It was late morning when I got off the train. A hot breeze ruffled the dried\
  \ leaves on the street. I could\u2019ve called a cab, but decided to walk the empty\
  \ road across the ancient countryside. Its stillness soothed me. It took me 35 minutes\
  \ to reach the town. Now that I was almost there, I felt all the heaviness of the\
  \ last hours.\n\nThe morning before, someone had knocked on my door.\n\u201CHi,\
  \ I\u2019m Ben, your new next-door neighbour.\u201D\n\u201CWhat about the Petersons?\u201D\
  \n\u201CThey just moved,\u201D he said, hesitant. \u201CHere, take this.\u201D He\
  \ handed me a folded sheet of paper. \u201CIt\u2019s a little poem. Sounds strange,\
  \ but it\u2019s the easiest way to get to know me. So\u2026 come whenever you want.\
  \ See ya.\u201D\nBack in my kitchen, I read the poem quickly. I found it less telling\
  \ than I had expected: you could just as easily think that the poem had written\
  \ itself.\n\nThat night I woke up in a sweat, without knowing why. I just felt the\
  \ agitation and an urge to force something out from inside myself and, no matter\
  \ what form would it take, just give to it a permanent one, before it was late.\
  \ Then, I saw the poem. \nShaking, I reached Ben\u2019s front door; it was open.\
  \ In the kitchen, Ben beckoned me to sit down.\n\u201CHow did you put yourself in\
  \ that paper? Where? I need\u2026 to do it, Ben. I feel\u2026 impalpable\u201D.\n\
  \n\nAnd now I was almost there. \nIt had been a four-hour train ride, but the undisturbed\
  \ motion of the train had helped me sleep. The \u2018Welcome to Oldcat\u2019 sign\
  \ was ruined, partially covered by the foliage of a stretching branch. I walked\
  \ to a grocery to get some water, though I hadn\u2019t been thirsty since the day\
  \ before.\n\u201CHow much is it, please?\u201D \n\u201CGimme 1 pound.\u201D An old\
  \ man behind the counter, who had been watching me trying to get the attention of\
  \ the cashier, approached. \u201CYou foreigner? First time in town, I see it. I\u2019\
  ll give you a tour.\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019m headed to Amesbury Road, 22.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Very, very well,\u201D he said slowly. \u201CIt\u2019ll be our final stop. 45 minutes,\
  \ no more.\u201D\n\nStrangely, I was not in a hurry; no more. Since I had left my\
  \ house at down, I had felt at peace. No concerns, no duties. My memory would bring\
  \ me back to no more than few seconds before. I made no plans, as well. \nThe town\
  \ seemed uninhabited. Anything, from the dusty roads, to the rusty gates of the\
  \ houses appeared to have remained untouched by development. The trees, either because\
  \ untrimmed, or simply because of unknown species, looked inscrutable. \nThe old\
  \ man showed me around, dragging himself sluggishly. Hardly he spoke, sometimes\
  \ he walked towards the doorway of a closed shop and knocked, never getting any\
  \ answer. He said things like: \u201CI used to buy milk here,\u201D or \u201Cthere\u2019\
  s no barber like Bob\u201D. \nAsking whether they were closed for holiday or because\
  \ they were out of business seemed pointless: I thought unlikely there would be\
  \ someone demanding their opening, anyway. \n\nAt Amesbury Road, we entered the\
  \ gate and passed through the gravestones, without a word. The trees at the corners\
  \ chirped like they were plucked by harpers. After some time, we stopped before\
  \ a tombstone. On it, the poem I had kept in my pocket was inscribed, along with\
  \ a name and a year: Ben Parker, 1836. When I turned, Ben was there.\n\u201CYou\u2019\
  re not the author.\u201D\n\u201CI am.\u201D\n\u201CYou should be dead.\u201D Silence.\
  \ \u201CWho are you?\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019m,\u201D he stepped forth, \u201Cwhat brought\
  \ you here. The travel, the poem, the train, the man. The trauma.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Trauma?\u201D\n\u201CYours. Of knowing.\u201D\n\u201CThat means I\u2019m dead. I\u2019\
  m late. I didn\u2019t find the place\u2026 haven\u2019t written anything.\u201D\n\
  \u201CIt\u2019s a long journey, here\u2019s only the beginning. You\u2019ll write\
  \ through your neighbour. He\u2019ll write for you.\u201D\n\u201CBut he\u2019s you.\u201D\
  \n\u201CNot really.\u201D He smiled. \u201CI\u2019m Ben, he\u2019s John and alive.\
  \ I\u2019ve been travelling in your life through your actions, as you\u2019ll do\
  \ with John\u2019s.\u201D\n\u201CYou mean my medical studies?\u201D Ben nodded.\
  \ \u201CI see. So, I\u2019m a poet, right? That\u2019s\u2026 unexpected.\u201D\n\
  \u201CDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll show you the way.\u201D\n\nThen I walked because\
  \ he walked."
