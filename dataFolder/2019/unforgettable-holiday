Text: "Spending time with those you love is priceless.  I and my family go for a holiday\
  \ to a seaside almost every year during summer. This year wasn't an exception. As\
  \ usual, we went by car, as my dad is super afraid of flying, but for the very first\
  \ time, we went to Bulgaria. The whole week of doing nothing, just sunbathing, eating,\
  \ swimming and a little bit of sightseeing. And that's it. Our holiday, nothing\
  \ special. Time flew and the last day came. My dad woke me up in a very nervous\
  \ way 'We don't have the car'. I was still half sleeping 'What?' I asked. 'Someone\
  \ stole our car!' Okay. I got it. Our car was stolen. I looked through a window\
  \ to make sure he wasn't lying. He wasn't. The place, where we left our car in the\
  \ evening, was totally empty. 'What are we going to do?' I asked my parents. It\
  \ wasn't the best idea as it was a question that had been crossing their mind probably\
  \ since the first moment when they found out. I'd never seen my parents so hopeless\
  \ and miserable. My dad contacted the hotel where we stayed and they contacted police\
  \ that came after one hour of waiting. One hour of fear and desperation. We needed\
  \ to work on our next plan which was to buy flight tickets. Anybody who has ever\
  \ bought a flight ticket knows, that more in advance = cheaper. Just imagine buying\
  \ last minute flight tickets for 4 people for today or following days. The prices\
  \ were incredibly high but we didn't have another choice. Unfortunately, the prices\
  \ from Bulgaria started at 600\u20AC while from Bucurest, Romania they were a little\
  \ bit cheaper. We booked the tickets and waited for dad to come back from a police\
  \ station. A taxi waited for us when he returned. We had to left more than half\
  \ of our things there because, of course, when you travel by a big car you pack\
  \ everything: two balls, three pairs of shoes each, fridge, the food we bought the\
  \ day before for the journey back... We took the taxi, I said goodbye to my favourite\
  \ shoes and went for a three-hour journey. After a couple of minutes sitting in\
  \ the car, I thought that we are in the slowest car ever. Fortunately, at the border\
  \ Romania Bulgaria we changed the driver and the car and this time we went super\
  \ fast. Especially after I made a call with an airline company (because I and my\
  \ mum, and my brother and dad have same names and I couldn't make check-ins) and\
  \ said we wouldn't have enough time to make check-in at the airport. The driver\
  \ heard it and went like crazy, I guess more than 150km/h in the city. I couldn't\
  \ believe how fast we were going, no stopping at red lights, going in the wrong\
  \ lines, overtaking more cars at once... And suddenly, all I heard were brakes.\
  \ Very loudly breaking sound and my mum screaming. My body was thrown in the front\
  \ but at the same time was stopped by a seat belt. Somewhere I heard also cars honking.\
  \ Our driver just turned to us, said 'Sorry', put the first gear and disappeared\
  \ from the scene of the accident. My whole family was in a big shock. We didn't\
  \ talk at all, everyone waited in silent what will happen next. 'Will we catch the\
  \ plane or not?' Well... We didn't."
