Text: "The Christmas of 2006 remains the worst of my life \u2013 but it is also, bizarrely,\
  \ my favourite.  \n\nI'd only lived in Edinburgh a few months but was already in\
  \ love with its crumbling beauty. To supplement my student lifestyle of pub dinners\
  \ and jacket potatoes and hand rolled cigarettes, I got a job at a movie theatre.\
  \ It was an easy job, but the hours were late and it was often close to midnight\
  \ before my shift ended. \n\nSuch was the case on December 23 when I decided to\
  \ walk the ten kilometres back to my flat. I was feeling forlorn - it was the first\
  \ Christmas I\u2019d spent away from my family and I was not especially excited\
  \ to return to an empty dorm room. \n\nEventually I found myself on a footpath winding\
  \ through a park. Up ahead I saw three figures, laughing and loud. Teenaged boys.\
  \ They wore sweat pants and had bad acne. As I approached, one of them asked me\
  \ for a cigarette. I said sorry and tried to continue walking, but he grabbed my\
  \ collar.\n\n\u201CI'm going to smash you now.\u201D \n\nHe got one good punch in\
  \ before I bent over and tucked my chest into a ball, trying to protect myself.\
  \ The others joined in, pummelling the sides of my face. One of them managed to\
  \ grab my wallet and their general grunting turned into demands for my pin number.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHey! Get off him! I\u2019ve called the cops!\u201D\n\nFrom somewhere\
  \ across the park, through the darkness. An orange light illuminating a small porch.\
  \ The shape of a man standing there, shouting. A miracle. \n\nThey ran off with\
  \ my wallet. I truly didn\u2019t care. I staggered towards the light because I didn\u2019\
  t know what else to do. When I got closer I saw a woman standing there too. She\
  \ smiled at me. The man looked much older than his voice had sounded. \n\n\u201C\
  Come on inside, lad.\u201D Martin and Jane. My guardian angels. \n\nWe sat at their\
  \ kitchen table and they apologized for their city, assuring me it was usually a\
  \ very nice place. I told them I know, I love it here. They poured me tea and gave\
  \ me painkillers and let me wash up in the bathroom. \n\nIn the mirror I saw a strange\
  \ face, puffy and purple and red. One of my eyes wouldn\u2019t open. I brought my\
  \ hands up to wash my face, gently, sure the merest touch would make me flinch \u2013\
  \ but instead I felt nothing, just the contours of these new lumps. I spit blood\
  \ into the sink. I was dizzy, exhausted. But I knew I\u2019d be fine. \n\nThe police\
  \ officer took our statements, then offered to give me a ride home. We sat in the\
  \ driveway while he filled out paperwork. I noticed the date on his report: December\
  \ 24. I turned away and stared at the small, tidy porch beneath the orange light.\
  \ House number 34. I could see the kitchen table through the window. My guardian\
  \ angels waved at me as we pulled away, enthusiastic waves that did not match the\
  \ sad looks on their faces. \n\nI slept through the whole next day. My face throbbed\
  \ and my lips were huge and my eye still wouldn\u2019t open. At one point I tried\
  \ to eat but just cried instead so I went back to bed.\n\nI must have made the decision\
  \ in the night without realizing it, because I opened both my eyes on Christmas\
  \ morning feeling oddly light. I went outside, found an open shop, and bought a\
  \ red ribbon and a bottle of wine. Then I began walking. \n\nHouse number 34. That\
  \ tidy little porch. There were more cars in the driveway this time. I scrawled\
  \ a thank you note to my angels and tied it to the bottle with the ribbon. \n\n\
  Jane answered the door. She looked shocked, as if worried that I needed rescuing\
  \ again. She waved me inside, said they had family over, insisted I meet them and\
  \ stay for lunch. I declined. They had already given me so much. Instead I stepped\
  \ off the porch, squinted back the Christmas morning sun, and strolled home."
