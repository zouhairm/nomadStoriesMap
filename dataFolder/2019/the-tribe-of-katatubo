Text: "It had been two months of solid work in the relenting heat. I could always\
  \ feel the texture of my own tongue. The air was dry, the dust permanently gathering\
  \ between my toes. I was exhausted, I was perpetually thirsty, and I wasn\u2019\
  t ready for what was next.\nI was in the Philippines, working and living in Nueva\
  \ Ecija with the local government on different projects, as part of a team of 20\
  \ young volunteers. There we were, ready to save the world, not knowing how many\
  \ times we would have to stop and stand in the shade every hour. The work is sometimes\
  \ jolly such as talking to local business stall holders, gathering data. Sometimes\
  \ it was standing in the heat in a makeshift workshop space, teaching interview\
  \ skills to the locals.\nEither way it was rewarding, but boy it was hot, and never\
  \ a whisper of wind for comfort or ease. \nAfter two months we are told by our team\
  \ leader that a local tribe is isolated but wants to join the local town and integrate-this\
  \ being our latest assignment. Straight away my host mother sucked her teeth and\
  \ tutted-it was clear they weren\u2019t wanted in our community.\nThe next day I\
  \ went to church with my host family and took the chance to ask my neighbours their\
  \ opinions. \nNobody wanted the tribe. I heard a lot of \u2018Katatubo are bad,\
  \ they will not fit in with us\u2019, and after hearing these words from people\
  \ who had taken care of me...I didn\u2019t want to help the tribe either.  \nThe\
  \ day day I reluctantly packed my bags, hopping aboard the bus, a 3 hour drive west\
  \ ahead of me with my team. I realised then my earphones has finally given up the\
  \ ghost and I was now on my own with my thoughts. To be honest my thoughts were\
  \ narrow...what on Earth was going to happen to me? Was this trip going to be a\
  \ disaster? What if they hated us...the outside help.\nI felt sick after 3 hours\
  \ and 6 stops along the way for various WC stops...every knock and jump of the bus\
  \ along the road jolting me back into the reality that I was about to spend a month\
  \ hating the experience. I had been sent away with a gift from my family, this gift\
  \ being the knowledge that this tribe were NO GOOD. \nfinally after many skin narrow\
  \ muddy tracks and turns we arrived..to an entire village stood in front of us.\n\
  I got off the bus with my bag over my shoulder, swallowing all hopes of a joyful\
  \ welcoming.\nHow very wrong I was...."
