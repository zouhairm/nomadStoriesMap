Text: "\u201CHow do we get across?\u201D The construction in the roundabout was making\
  \ it very difficult for us to reach the destination I had longed to see again for\
  \ so long \u2014a broken engagement, a master\u2019s degree, five jobs, five homes\u2014\
  \ for four years and three months if we want to be more exact. L\u2019\xC9glise\
  \ Sainte-Marie-Madeleine is like none I\u2019d ever seen before it, a whole Catholic\
  \ temple that at the center of the altar has Saint Mary Magdalen as the protagonist.\
  \ It is a grandiose show of wealth and power built by Napoleon to make Paris a worthy\
  \ capital to his empire.\n\nThe first time I visited I was a student in Ireland.\
  \ My then fianc\xE9 decided to visit me from our home country (a good 14-hour flight\
  \ away) and take me to Paris, I thought this decision was extremely romantic and\
  \ sweet, turns out he wanted to see a band. We went into the church because I wanted\
  \ to see it, one of the only things I got to decide during that trip since all my\
  \ ideas seemed to be either a waste of time or of money. I was in awe of the giant\
  \ columns that welcome you in, the intricate holly water fountains on each side\
  \ of the nave, the statues, the pews, the pulpit, etc. Though that was nothing compared\
  \ to what I felt once I saw the altar: a giant statue of Saint Mary Magdalen surrounded\
  \ by angels, her eyes to the heavens. I fell in love with that church, lit a candle\
  \ for the Virgin and said a short prayer before I felt the urge to leave, I had\
  \ spent too much time on something only for myself.\n\u201CI think if we cross the\
  \ main street and the approach from the side we can get to the church.\u201D He\
  \ was very right. He was also an entirely new boyfriend. Once we reached the top\
  \ of the long stairs, the columns I remembered so well, I let go of his hand, even\
  \ though I don\u2019t identify as Catholic anymore, it still feels wrong to show\
  \ affection in a church. I crossed myself with the holy water by the entrance and\
  \ took my time, I wanted to take everything in. \nThe church provides information\
  \ sheets with explanations of the history of the place, as well as details on all\
  \ the main works of art; I grabbed one and followed it. Statue after statue I discovered\
  \ all the details and gorgeous workmanship I had missed the first time around. And\
  \ then I saw her, she was imposing in her simplicity, powerful and beautiful, I\
  \ could not believe I had missed her before, her image was stuck in my head even\
  \ as I turned around to return my info sheet and leave.\n\nI walked towards the\
  \ door and suddenly, I stopped. Rummaging through my fanny pack I was struggling\
  \ to find two Euro. I proceeded to rush over to the collections box, but the lady\
  \ already there seemed to be struggling too. Her bill didn\u2019t seem to fit in\
  \ the small slot marked for such purposes, so she smiled and said something in French\
  \ I didn\u2019t understand. I smiled back and gestured to my coin, miming that I\
  \ would try and push her bill in, this time I did understand her thanking me and\
  \ she walked away to light a candle in front of the Virgin Mary. I realized that\
  \ there was a little lever you needed to pull to make the money go down, so I did\
  \ and then picked up a candle.\n\nI hesitated for a moment in front of the Virgin,\
  \ but she was calling, so I kept walking until I reached her, Saint Joan d\u2019\
  Arc. Something about her determined face and her defiant sword and how she stood\
  \ there by herself, made me see that my candle was for her. \u201CI have no idea\
  \ if there\u2019s a specific prayer for you, but please give me some of your strength,\
  \ I will need it. If I ever come back, I promise to visit you again\u201D And with\
  \ that short prayed I left the church I love so much, having found another love."
