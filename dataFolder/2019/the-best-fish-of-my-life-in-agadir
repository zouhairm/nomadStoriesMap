Text: "Everything I thought I knew about Morocco was flipped upside down when I explored\
  \ Agadir and the neighboring fishing villages off of the southern Atlantic coast.\
  \ You can't get anything fresher than fish from a seaside city, even if you're that\
  \ close to the desert! And let me tell you, Agadir is NOT a sleepy beach town.\n\
  \nVisiting Morocco for the first time, I was expecting to see smooth, sandy dunes\
  \ (which I eventually got to surf!), and instead my boyfriend and I were surprised\
  \ to find flat desert terrain with colorful architecture. Among the typical tan\
  \ and red buildings with brown accents were modern designs with both light and bright\
  \ colors that popped against the blue sky.\n\nWe strolled the beach, hoping to find\
  \ fresh seafood, and caught the beautiful sunset instead. The color of the sand\
  \ was so rich and looked like it was glistening with dew. Soaking in the setting\
  \ sun, checking out the carnival games, and watching some mothers in the water with\
  \ their children completed our list of things to do. It was dinnertime!\n\nOn our\
  \ way towards the marina for dinner, we saw the words of a Moroccan motto begin\
  \ to illuminate on the side of the hill, \u201CAll\u0101h, al Wa\u1E6Dan, al Malik.\u201D\
  \ Standing guard over the town, the writing on the hill reads, \u201CGod, Homeland,\
  \ King.\u201D\n\nThe marina is the shopping destination offering local-made art\
  \ products and crafts alongside top international brands beneath luxurious apartment\
  \ homes. Just like the beautiful boats lined up in a row, the night clubs, pubs\
  \ and restaurants lined the marina offering lovely views of the water and a lot\
  \ of international cuisine options. \n\nBeing so close to the ocean, we were excited\
  \ to try Morocco\u2019s seafood. We walked to the end of the marina and finally\
  \ stepped inside the office of the apartment complex to ask a local for suggestions.\
  \ The concierge was happy to direct us to the fish market as a great place for the\
  \ freshest seafood in the city. He even led us through a secret trap door behind\
  \ his desk. \n\nAlong the way, an older gentleman guided us to his cousin\u2019\
  s restaurant in the market filled with numerous stalls and options to choose from.\
  \ Each one offered similar foods for a comparable price, but his restaurant came\
  \ with such great hospitality, we couldn't turn him down. He even took us to the\
  \ back where they stored the \"it\u2019s-so-fresh-it\u2019s-still-alive\" seafood,\
  \ and we knew it was going to be good.\n\nWe got a lot of fresh fish for a low price,\
  \ but you have to be careful of add-ons. The fish market is a great deal until you\
  \ order the gambas (prawns) and other bottom half items. They\u2019ll get you with\
  \ the prawns because the prawns are too delicious to resist!\n\nLike any desert\
  \ town, when the sun goes down, the people come out. We enjoyed the fresh fish and\
  \ lay back atmosphere so much that we noticed groups coming and going before we\
  \ had our fill. While we were eating with the locals, we set our forks and knives\
  \ aside to eat like the locals. This was a meal unlike any other.\n\nThe most inspiring\
  \ business in the market (in my opinion) was the man who charged folks to wash their\
  \ hands before and after the meal. Agadir holds a special place in my heart."
