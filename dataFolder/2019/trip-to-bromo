Text: "Let me tell you my unforgettable experience. The experience I felt when I set\
  \ my foot down in Tengger, East Java for the first time in my life. The experience\
  \ filled by the precious story and floral wreath of eternal flower, Edelwies. The\
  \ cold air always remember me of that story.\nMy watch pointed out 03.13, exactly\
  \ before the dawn. The travel I went by stopped close to some muffler and glove\
  \ sellers. The cold air caressed my face, make me shivered and chilled until I should\
  \ have drew my grey shawl in my neck and embraced my body hard as possible. I accepted\
  \ it as a congratulation for my coming in Tengger land. I and my friends went immediately\
  \ to a wine \u2013colored jeep that would bring us to start our impressed trip when\
  \ it came. The jeep climbed the road goes steadily upward in Tengger\u2019s range\
  \ of hills being covered by the darkness. Sometimes I saw some of Tengger\u2019\
  s residents climbed in the side of road with bringing their agricultural devices.\
  \ The jeep stopped near by a long stone stair soaring highly to the top of a hill.\
  \ I stepped it up without any hesitancy. The atmosphere was still dark when I arrived\
  \ to the top of the hill. I could hardly find anything besides a hexagonal area\
  \ with a pillar in the center of it. The area was crowded by many people. I was\
  \ still anxious of the place until I found some persons were taking photos while\
  \ pointing something in the dale far of my standing place. I was more and more curious\
  \ when I saw my friends did the same thing. Then I joined them and got something\
  \ very astonishing. Bromo mount located precisely under the foot of mountain range.\
  \ The sun started to address a moment after that. It provided a beautiful sunrise\
  \ scenery spoiled every eyes. The golden sunshine making Bromo mountain was brick-red\
  \ colored and its hot vapor of its crater which was going up caused the scenery\
  \ became more amazing. The sunlight that chased away the darkness of dawn made me\
  \ aware that I was among floral wreathes of Edelweis growing around hill\u2019s\
  \ peak. I was pleasantly surprise at the beautiful view which was never seen by\
  \ my eyes before. We took some pictures among Edelweis with brick-red colored Bromo\
  \ and attractive golden sunrise as the background.After being satisfied taking some\
  \ photos and being some Edelwies as memorabilia, we carried on the trip.\nAfter\
  \ that,we went to our main destination, Bromo\u2019s crater. Reaching the place,\
  \ we had to ride the jeep and go through a rather distant way until it stopped in\
  \ a sandy area in the foot of mountain range which surrounded Bromo. The area was\
  \ named \u201CPasirBerbisik\u201D. The name more knowledgeable for me. Every time\
  \ the wind flushes on the area, the wind-sand friction would produce the sound of\
  \ sizzling like a whisper. We had to walk far away from our jeep parking to reach\
  \ the crater. Before that I didn\u2019t leave my chance for riding the horses in\
  \ the middle of the sandy area\u2019s enchantment among Tengger\u2019s billow of\
  \ dust. I was seriously mesmerized when reaching Bromo\u2019scrster that always\
  \ blow the hot vapor out. The deep hole as hundred metres with boiledsulphur within\
  \ it. I felt that my feet were trembled when I turned my back on the volcanic hole\
  \ brimful with boiled sulphur. The admiration and fear mixed in myself. I didn\u2019\
  t forget to take some pictures and held a paper written \u201CI wish you here\u201D\
  \ at the same time, it was for my adore friends which were not with me at that time.\n\
  As the last treatment and complement for the trip, we decided to visit the top of\
  \ Malang which is a nice place for enjoying fresh air. We could see spread area\
  \ of Malang while taking a rest after a long exhausting tour, however it was also\
  \ very amazing at the same time. I really thanked to Allah because finally I could\
  \ take of my heavy jacket I wore for almost a rest of day. I sat in one of top\u2019\
  s side and enjoyed precious twilight. That all never faded from my mind."
