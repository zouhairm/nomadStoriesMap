Text: "At a young age, a fascination for Ireland grew within me. Maybe it was on my\
  \ own terms, or maybe the seed was planted from my Father's dreams of traveling\
  \ there. I would constantly look at pictures of Dublin and imagine myself singing\
  \ \"Galway Girl\" with a Guinness in hand at a local pub. I set my phone background\
  \ to the Cliffs of Moher, a magnificent tourist attraction, with the hope that if\
  \ I thought about this dream enough, it would come true. I always had this belief\
  \ that once I would go to Ireland, everything would \"make sense\". \n\nFast forward\
  \ to April 2018 and I was on a flight to Dublin with my best friend. The two weeks\
  \ of exploring the streets and tourist attraction flew by all too quick. There were\
  \ many beers, many songs, many coffees with Bailey's, and many laughs. A trip I\
  \ never wanted to end. Towards the end of our trip, we did it. We got to the Cliffs\
  \ of Moher. To any local, these were just regular cliffs, crowded with tourists.\
  \ To me, this was something I accomplished. A dream I made come true. I paused to\
  \ take photos on my camera, then looked at my phone for the time. Sure enough, my\
  \ phone background was still the Cliffs of Moher. I held my phone up in front of\
  \ me, and I was in the exact same spot that original photo was taken in (that I\
  \ took off Google). \n\nThe whole trip my friend kept saying, \"I'm surprised you\
  \ haven't cried yet, you've been talking about this dream for years\".  Being in\
  \ Ireland just felt like home to me. It felt more like a home than the actual place\
  \ I lived in for the last 10 years. Everything started to make sense. Several things\
  \ started to come together in my mind and heart. This had to be the place I moved\
  \ to one day. This had to be the place I got married and raised my family. This\
  \ escape was everything I needed to get away from my reality, back home. I did this.\
  \ I got myself to this point and I can get myself to many more. \n\nHow is it that\
  \ you can barely know a place, but have it feel right? Have it feel like the home,\
  \ you had your whole life? I'm still trying to figure that out, but I feel in love\
  \ on that trip. I fell in love with Ireland."
