Text: "I was really exhausted but persisted with life in true milleanial style. As\
  \ I had been taught in order for me to be a good person, successful and happy. I\
  \ just had be really really hard working. With of course taking \na bit of rest\
  \ when only really, really necesarry.\n\nSo obviously I was now working as an exoctic\
  \ dancer, running my own beauty startup business & studying philosophy for fun when\
  \ I had the time to help organise my overly creative mind. And living a life that\
  \ still somehow felt a bit mediocre.\n\nI woke slightly drunk from the night before\
  \ put some jogging bottoms and a jumper on. A pair of trainers and my new but technically\
  \ old coat as I had bought it from my favourite charity shop. And put on Charlotte\
  \ my tri colour Cavalier King Charles Spaniel harness who although was 6 still looked\
  \ like and acted like a puppy. \n\nShe is certainly my spirit animal. As although\
  \ they say black doesnt crack I even sometimes look younger than my 23 year old\
  \ sister and I am 34. And Charlottes long wavy ears funnily resemble my hair style.\
  \  \n\nAfter walking Charlotte I get home and realise I am craving some human specifically\
  \ male attention. So I start scrolling down my whatsapp list to see who was the\
  \ lucky emotionally unavailable guy, who I was going to insanely flirt with to seduce\
  \ him into taking me on a date. Which I would probably cancel as I came to my senses\
  \ before the date came around. Unless he was willing to take me on a decent date.\
  \ Maybe I will give Matt another chance I thought. He had independently made the\
  \ decision to take me on a date to an art gallery followed by a few drinks in the\
  \ members bar.\n\nAs Im scrolling I come across my friend Tyas whatsapp who as a\
  \ smoking hot new hot profile pic. So ofcourse I have to confirm to her of how much\
  \ of a Godess she is. Then she proceeds to send me a voice note. I love Tyas voice\
  \ note as it still fascinated me that a half Thai half Italian petite lady had such\
  \ a strong Scotish accent. \"Hey babe, Im just in Thailand having eyelid surgery.\
  \ How are you I miss you.\" She says in the voice note. I type back, \"Oh wow Thailand\
  \ I wish I could be there with you.\" She types back, \"babe book a ticket Im here\
  \ alone.\"\n\nAnd to a short story even shorter that day I booked a ticket to Thailand.\
  \ Despite having already been to the South of France with the love of my life at\
  \ time and a solo cruise of the meditranian earlier that year. \n\nAnd it was one\
  \ of the best decisions I made. Beause it was this holliday to Thailand that helped\
  \ me to surprisingly find out what should have been obvious. But only became obvious\
  \ once I took that life reviving holliday. And that was that  the best days of my\
  \ life were here and even better days were coming."
