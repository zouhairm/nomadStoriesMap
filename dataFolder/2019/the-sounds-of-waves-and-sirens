Text: "This story starts in honor of the memory of an explorer and adventurous free\
  \ spirit. These were the attributes of an athletic man, marathon runner, very special\
  \ to me: my father.   \n\nI have never imagined I would live close to the paradise,\
  \ in a tiny piece of land in the middle of the enormous Atlantic Ocean. Faial: The\
  \ Blue Island.\n\nNew adventures were waiting for our family. This Brazilian Soap\
  \ Opera plot is a trite: a jobless husband with his wife and two daughters in an\
  \ underdeveloped country. Something had to be done. In order to financially support\
  \ his family, my father didn\u2019t think twice: he moved to Portugal. He worked\
  \ really hard. After struggling in a new country for six years, finally, he was\
  \ financially stable to bring his girls close to him. \n\nNonetheless, what was\
  \ not in our family plans was that when I was 17 years old, the most unstable part\
  \ of our lives had just begun. A week before turning 18 years old, seating at Concei\xE7\
  \xE3o beach, I was trying to forget my problems while listening to the sound of\
  \ the waves. Meanwhile, on the other side of the island, there was a huge fire in\
  \ the forest. Due to the fire magnitude, all the firefighters were notified. Even\
  \ the ones who were off duty had to leave their homes, driving their own cars, to\
  \ help. That was complete chaos.\n\nFor the first time, I heard ambulance sirens\
  \ out of tune. Ironically, that funny little moment made me think something really\
  \ awful had happened. Out of a sudden, my father\u2019s friend arrived desperately,\
  \ as if he were bringing bad news. My heart started pounding. I already knew. After\
  \ being paged to help with the fire, one of the firefighters who were off duty crossed\
  \ his path with my father while father was riding his beloved violet Suzuki. The\
  \ tuneless sirens were not funny anymore. They were a sign that my father was heading\
  \ to the hospital in a coma. Isn\u2019t it ironic? The heroic father collides with\
  \ a life-saver firefighter. I was still sat by the beach when I got the horrifying\
  \ news. With watering eyes, I couldn\u2019t see anything. Nonetheless, I ran to\
  \ the accident\u2019s place. At that moment, I couldn\u2019t feel the ground below\
  \ my feet. I couldn\u2019t feel anything.\n\nFrom that moment on, everything was\
  \ painfully hard. Suddenly, it was only the three of us: three lonely girls without\
  \ money to go back home to their caring and nurturing family. However, I have never\
  \ imagined finding a strong heroine in this trip to the unknown: a heroine that\
  \ has the name of a queen and a teaching degree. Mother worked really hard washing\
  \ the dishes at a hotel kitchen. From the two years, we lived at the paradise island,\
  \ for one and a half years, it was only the three of us. Only when I turned 18 years\
  \ old I realized the strength within my mother. We became friends. At that moment,\
  \ I acknowledged she had the bravery of our ancestors within her soul. She fought\
  \ for us alone. She suffered. She took care of her little girls in the best way\
  \ she could. Despite her shattered feelings and her struggle to take care of us,\
  \ she stood up like a fortress after a war. After seeing her down, I witnessed my\
  \ mother putting herself together. Piece by piece. Amongst the chaos, I have learnt\
  \ that traveling feels like a one-way ticket to get to know yourself other people's\
  \ strength. \n\nAt Faial, I also got to know people from everywhere in the world\
  \ and I had the opportunity to absorb each and every experience in this unknown\
  \ place. The architecture of the houses, the fortresses, the stone churches, the\
  \ magnificent Summit in front of the island, and the art pieces spread all over\
  \ the floor collected the most beautiful stories I have ever heard. This experience\
  \ taught me a lesson I will take with me forever: when someone is brave enough to\
  \ step outside its comfort zone, we can see its real character. Being able to tell\
  \ this story of bravery makes me want to keep this legacy with my own future experiences."
