Text: I was Travelling from one station to another in early morning. And was desperate
  to make an amazing movie but needed and story but could not find a right story as
  i was travelling through train i got window seat,With lovely monsoon weather outside
  and Stunning scene coming on the way from Mumbai to Pune while i was sitting and
  enjoying the view a lady sat before me And started talking to me suddenly and not
  finding it Akward i was answering her But not finding his Question Interesting as
  i wanted to Enjoy the Scenes. Few Hours of the Journey we entered into Lonavala
  Ghat and The ghat is stunning Beauty with All the Tunnels made through mountains,Greenery
  And Ghats With Bridges made During British era Made me to think What if there was
  a kingdom a Medieval kingdom with palaces and all medieval structures hidden from
  modern world and That's where i got my idea of my film and it just came and came
  whole the idea rushed as the greenery surrounding me and all the old structures
  they gave me the idea and then i wrote it down into my diary and worked on it and
  today we are working on this film and soon will start shoot and this my travel short
  story that i did'nt Expect to find this way And the lady on my side slept the whole
  after that so i could right my Epic Tale
