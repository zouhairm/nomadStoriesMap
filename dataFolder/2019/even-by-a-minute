Text: "\u201CIf Germans hate anything, it\u2019s being late,\u201D he said, \u201C\
  Even by a minute.\u201D The wind scrapes over my cheeks, past the two of us standing\
  \ on the concrete platform and down the train tracks. The blue screen above the\
  \ track reads 12:02, three minutes before scheduled departure. I shiver from the\
  \ sharp chill that has forced its way through my scarf onto my bare skin underneath.\
  \  \n\nEarlier that day, the Christmas markets of Cologne buzz; a carnival of characters,\
  \ overflowing with adults and children, tourists and locals. It\u2019s a small cedar\
  \ village residing in the shadow of a massive stone cathedral. The tiny cabins promote\
  \ their individual trades under the watch of a 8 ft tree, adorned with strings of\
  \ white lights that reflect off of the gold and silver ornaments that were sprinkled\
  \ among them. A sign that reads \u201CWeihnachtsmarkt\u201D hangs above a large\
  \ stage in the center of the market, covered in yellow papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 stars.\
  \  \n\nThe people bounce down the long walkway between the two rows of wooden stands\
  \ like slow pinballs. We mingle among them, following the warm scent of chocolate\
  \ crepes. Merchants display hand-crafted silver jewelry and painted glass ornaments.\
  \ Some proudly exhibit candles made from honey, sculpted into shapes of animals.\
  \ Kraut and hot sausages are dipped from a large silver vat into paper bowls. Hot\
  \ red wine is ladled into ceramic mugs, decorated with stick figure angels. Clear\
  \ tubes hang from beams over the food counters like cow udders. I watched hungry\
  \ customers squeeze thick, yellow paste onto bratwursts and thickly cut French fries.\n\
  \nLaughter and puffs of heat from warm mouths fill the mid-day air. We continue\
  \ walking until happy chatter is replaced by sounds of a river flowing steadily\
  \ beneath us. We stand next to the railing of a bridge with thousands of locks attached;\
  \ locks of all sizes and colors, mostly reds and pinks with hearts drawn on or engraved\
  \ into the metal. \n\u201CThe bridge is so weighted down from the locks they have\
  \ to come cut some off.\u201D He explained. \n\u201CA friend of mine put a lock\
  \ on there with his girlfriend and when they broke up, he came back with a pair\
  \ of bolt cutters. He searched for probably two hours before he found it.\u201D\
  \ \n\nWe stroll arm in arm, with my gloveless hands shoved into my coat pockets,\
  \ until we spot a beer hall and decide to stop. Fresh, bubbling K\xF6lsch is delivered\
  \ to the table in glasses so small I can drink the entire thing in three gulps.\
  \ The bubbles float angrily to the surface and burst into miniscule pieces of wet\
  \ confetti. We drink them easily, and as soon as we place the empty glasses back\
  \ onto the table, the waiter shuffles over with a round platter lined with dozens\
  \ of tiny beers to replace them. He takes a pen from the front of his apron and\
  \ places two tic-marks on my coaster. \n\u201CThey\u2019ll keep bringing fresh pints\
  \ until you cover the glass,\u201D he laughed.  \n\nMy nose tingles from the cold,\
  \ but my body is warm and loose as we amble back to the train station. I hadn\u2019\
  t known anything about this place before arriving; only that it\u2019s the childhood\
  \ home of someone I love. \nThe glowing white numbers of the clock turn 12:05 as\
  \ the still gray beams of the track begin to vibrate, and the nose of a white train\
  \ car appears in the distance. I look up at the screen behind me for the train times.\
  \ Departing 12:06. It was right on time."
