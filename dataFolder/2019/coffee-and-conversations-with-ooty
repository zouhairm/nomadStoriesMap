Text: "Udhagamandalam(Ooty) is a small but a mystique and a must visit hill station\
  \ in the state of Tamil Nadu, in southern India. Walking on the delicate grass of\
  \ rose garden, our local guide(I was accompanied with a group of people) tells us\
  \ about the indigenous traditions and culture of the place, the food and berry wines\
  \ still made in village households. Only a handful of home stays now serve local\
  \ delicacies like bamboo shoot, kidney beans and pork curries.\nEager for a taste\
  \ of traditional life in the region, I moved to a small family-run farm stay along\
  \ rice paddies, in a typical Coonoor village. This is a local family\u2019s endeavour\
  \ to create an organic oasis; huts furnished with bamboo artefacts and earthen pots,\
  \ lampshades carved out of pumpkins, rice paddies sustained without fertilisers\
  \ or pesticides, an indigenous waste water recycling technology, and delicious food\
  \ that is entirely organic, including the oil, rice, vegetables, and even fruits.\n\
  \nDuring my visit my guide told me how the place has changed since the British planted\
  \ its first coffee plantations. Spending his childhood on these estates, he ultimately\
  \ became a coffee trader and later a coffee broker, all the while, trying to perfect\
  \ the art of making coffee from seed to cup. When we finally taste his organic in-house\
  \ brew, we are reminded of the quaint cafes in small Italian towns!We spend lazy\
  \ afternoons on the farm, splashing in the rice paddies in gumboots and a traditional\
  \ bamboo rain protector, and cycling in the surrounding villages, with maize fields\
  \ swaying in the backdrop. On hearing about our love for the roads less travelled,\
  \ Naga(our guide) drives us through his favourite coffee trails in Ooty, enchanting\
  \ us with stories of the Toda jungle tribe, who tame wild elephants by feeding them\
  \ weed! He introduces us to a hobbyist beekeeper who makes the tastiest honey I\u2019\
  ve ever tried, and gives us a glimpse into the lives of monks, at lesser known monasteries\
  \ in the neighbouring Tibetan camp. \n\nWe drove through tea plantations to reach\
  \ this lesser known but beautiful colonial villa in a place called as \"NeedleCraft\"\
  . We were invited in by Mrs. Naaz, who runs this shop that offers exquisitely hand-embroidered\
  \ napkins, bed covers, cushion and pillow covers etc. The work is done by missionary\
  \ women and sold at this house. I sat there hours taking notes about other scenic\
  \ beauties present in and around Ooty and the living conditions which affect those\
  \ local people. \n\nIn the latter half of the week we were having a stroll around\
  \ gardens, sanctuaries and waterfalls but over our last cup of coffee when Naga\
  \ asks us what we\u2019ll miss most about his homeland. With a pause, I say, the\
  \ coffee and conversations."
