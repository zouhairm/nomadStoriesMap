Text: "It was only a short adventure to Bucarest to watch a football game with my\
  \ cousin, the 2012 UEFA Cup Final. He's originally Russian, I'm Argentinean, my\
  \ uncle married his mom, and we've been like brothers for over a decade. Both fans\
  \ of the same team, we find ourselves in the Romanian capital for 1 night, and as\
  \ it turned out it was a fantastic one!\nAs we're leaving behind our hotel, we notice\
  \ a couple of young men struggling to start up a car engine by connecting two batteries.\
  \ Both cousins immediately tried to fix the problem for them. Now, between my cousin\
  \ and me, we speak 5 languages, none that could assist us on the current situation.\
  \ So with hand signals and a few smiles, we managed to help these guys head back\
  \ to work, or wherever they were going. The perfect Good Deed.\nA few blocks down\
  \ that same avenue, a member of the local Press notices that we're dressed for tonight's\
  \ game and dares for a quick interview with us. Main questions were: \"Do you like\
  \ Romania so far?\" and \"What do you think about the local cuisine?\". With not\
  \ even two hours in the country, we weren't able to grasp the whole reality. He\
  \ asked us where we come from and we told them: my cousin lives in Brighton (UK)\
  \ and I live in Prague (Czechia), and together with our backgrounds, he suspected\
  \ he found the golden egg of stories for tomorrow's headlines. So he decided on\
  \ inviting us for lunch, right across the street from where we were standing, where\
  \ the major was giving out the most typical meal in Romania (call it karma or whatever\
  \ you want for fixing a car battery). BY THE WAY, it was Romania's celebration for\
  \ independence that day, thus the strange yet nice coincidence. \nOf course we accepted\
  \ the invitation, the locals have been very friendly so far, this didn't seem to\
  \ be an exception.\nOur newest friend took us to meet the major of Bucarest and\
  \ quickly found us two gigantic plates with a delicious Moldavian Stew with three\
  \ Sarmale (cabbage rolls) on the side. Mind you, we were not the only people waiting\
  \ for food in that place, plenty of other families, ornamented with very colorful\
  \ clothing and tiny Romanian flags, have been queuing there all morning. In addition\
  \ to the free food served on that spot, there was a peculiar music band playing\
  \ local folk songs wholeheartedly. A beautiful show!\nAll in all, we got to enjoy\
  \ amazing local food, and a great music spectacle, while experiencing our first\
  \ (definitely not the last!) trip to Romania. Photos were taken; interviews were\
  \ conducted. And, without reasonable doubt, one of our craziest adventures ever\
  \ happened!"
