Text: "Osaka hadn\u2019t been part of the plan originally, but when the engineering\
  \ student \u2014 the first person that we\u2019d met our first night in the country\
  \ \u2014 followed up to repeat the invitation to his English study group, we thought:\
  \ why not. We\u2019d be passing nearby anyway, I had vague notions of the city being\
  \ cool and huge and really into baseball, and the guy seemed so genuinely eager\
  \ to have native speakers chat with his gang of what we tacitly assumed would be\
  \ fellow globally curious millennials.\n \nWe\u2019d be staying with a friend of\
  \ his who had more space, and, he assured us, was also super welcoming. We show\
  \ up straight from the station and clammy from the journey, shoes swinging from\
  \ twin overstuffed packs, bottle of student-budget red in hand.\n\nWhen the door\
  \ opens to reveal a person half my height and at least three times my age I am,\
  \ momentarily, taken aback. But there isn\u2019t time for dwelling on misplaced\
  \ expectations. Our hostess commands a warm, electric energy that whisks us briskly\
  \ through the shoe-lined entranceway and on into a dining room, where our inviter\
  \ and a dozen other youngsters loll around a gleaming chabudai table, joking, drinking,\
  \ and looking for all the world like they are seated in some student bar, not the\
  \ emporium of tasteful furnishings we\u2019ve somehow stumbled into.\n\nExchanging\
  \ awkward bows, I fumble names around the table. Laughter flows at my wide-eyed\
  \ amazement at the fugu \u2014 not to mention unconventional chopstick manoeuvres\
  \ \u2014 but it's friendly laughter, and I am quickly having too much fun to be\
  \ embarrassed by my out-of-place \u2018backpacker\u2019s best\u2019. An older man\
  \ emerges from the kitchen, bearing a still-smoking pan of takoyaki. Grinning, he\
  \ declares a toast to our arrival and our culinary immersion, and in one sweet-and-sour\
  \ gulp I\u2019m introduced both to the magic of plum wine and the drinking cry \u201C\
  Kanpai!\u201D\n\nOver the sharp smells and gratifying crunch of Kansai cooking,\
  \ I hear about the authors and the artists and the jobs abroad that have inspired,\
  \ in different ways, the groups\u2019 devotion to learn English. But, as sake-heavy\
  \ youngsters who will stay the night start raiding cabinets and crashing out with\
  \ the familiarity of college dormmates, I also get a sense of something more \u2014\
  \ the way that English practice goes beyond an aspiration or a hobby, in this home.\
  \ The group share wit and anecdotes with all the ease of chosen family, and it\u2019\
  s hard to not get swept up in the ready intimacy shared between the plates and generations.\
  \ \_\n\nWalking to our bedroom, we pass an antique sword, and our host cannot contain\
  \ her laughter at the hushed reverence with which we both admire it. Before I know\
  \ it, the sword is off the wall and in my hands, and she\u2019s directing me at\
  \ hip and shoulder into proper swinging form, providing war-like whooshes to accompany\
  \ my strokes. \u201CGoodnight, Samurai!\u201D she laughs, as she takes her leave.\n\
  \ \n***\n \nIn the morning she is up before us, efficiently preparing her small\
  \ kitchen for what appears to be a ceremony.\n \nI\u2019m still in pyjamas when\
  \ she wraps her aunt\u2019s kimono round me, admires it, tuts at my short hair.\
  \ We sit as we\u2019re instructed, curious and unprepared. We marvel at each artefact\
  \ produced from the chabako: cupping the exquisite tea bowl, a gift kept from her\
  \ wedding day; pressing the silken cleansing cloth against our palms. \n\nWhen she\
  \ thrusts the matcha with its bamboo whisk into my hands, her gleeful energy crackles\
  \ through the ritual\u2019s restraint, and she guides my unsure motion with a wrist\
  \ firmly on mine. Under her proud smile, I feel the stiff paste give way into a\
  \ gentle, lighter foam, smell the vegetal aroma blossom into mellow sweetness. I\
  \ feel viscerally part of this ancient art, and of this home, even if I hardly understand\
  \ the rotation of the tea scoop, or the function of the ornate fan tucked into my\
  \ sash. \n\nAs we sit to sip and savour the tea that we\u2019ve prepared together,\
  \ she asks us what we want to see while we're in Osaka. Incredulous, I giggle. My\
  \ experience here feels so complete, I want to tell her. Is it really just beginning?"
