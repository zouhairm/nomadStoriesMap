Text: "I was born in a day god was very i'll,\nwith the star of the good bye tatooed\
  \ in my heart and a scent of lost in my path.\nLike a soft essence in the darkness\
  \ of my been,\ntrying to seach for happiness without fulfill. Trying to search a\
  \ home, a place and maybe to know what chip i am in the world's puzzle.\n\nI was\
  \ born in a day god was feeling bad,\nin me he putted all the pain that a soul can\
  \ have, always losing, always outcasted and always sad.\n\nThey say now that i'm\
  \ devil and mad,\_because i look not for money but for a true path,\nbut i don't\
  \ understand it im just trying to have a heart, to do something important that trascends\
  \ space and time.\n\nI was born in a day god was very i'll...\nand with that i live\
  \ my days with lonelyness and leaves, with confussion and mistreat.\n\nI just hope\
  \ i didn't woomed everyone that were unlucky to be in my heart,\nbecause that only\
  \ creates pain, sadness, a huge caos and,\_\nof course, a hard time.\n\nSimply because\
  \ a bad star.\nSimply because i was born in a day god was feeling really bad. (\
  \ poem of a book of my own authory called The Tales of a Forgotten Soul.)\n\ni lived\
  \ in the jungle of Amazonas, with Ashaninkas tribes. I explored Mauchu Picchu and\
  \ all south america until i ran out of cash. A free soul i am. Yogui, meditator,\
  \ away from the mundane of life. I just want to discover the misteries of the world\
  \ and find truth that after, i can share in books and tales, in poems and histories\
  \ as well. I am outcasted i know but i prefer the word genuine to describe my soul."
