Text: "It does not smell there and smells have long since disappeared, but was so\
  \ difficult to breathe, as if something was squeezing the chest.\n\nThe word Auschwitz,\
  \ in the minds of many people, is a symbol or even the quintessence of evil, horror,\
  \ death and the concentration of the most unthinkable tortures.\n\nAbout 6 years\
  \ ago, when I was in high school. one of the teachers told us about concentration\
  \ camps. Her stories struck me so deeply I decided that someday I have to see everything\
  \ in real life.\n\nLast year I was an exchange student in Czech Republic, and since\
  \ it was my first time in Europe I planned to see as much as possible. When it became\
  \ clear that we are going to Krakow I have not doubted for a minute that we have\
  \ to visit Auschwitz. \nThe first part of the tour begins immediately after entering\
  \ the gate with the sadly famous inscription \u201CArbeit macht frei\u201D (Work\
  \ brings freedom) but the freedom there has not received anyone.\n\nAuschwitz consists\
  \ of three parts and the tour takes place in the first two. Auschwitz 1 was created\
  \ in the place of pre-war barracks. It contained between 15 000 and 20 000 prisoners.\
  \ This part is now a museum, the most terrifying museum I have ever seen. Behind\
  \ glass showcases there is a huge amount of shoes, hairbrushes, tons of hair, children\
  \ belongings and suitcases of killed and tortured people. The worst thing is that\
  \ some people thought they were going to a better life, to work. They took with\
  \ them all their things, suitcases, and children took with themselves toys. And\
  \ only when they would arrive to the camp, absolutely everything was taken away\
  \ from them. People were even shaved off.\n\nIn the middle of our tour, my heart\
  \ started to ache because of that horror. The horror of realizing that these hair,\
  \ glasses and shoes belonged to a living man. Maybe a postman, maybe to a student\
  \  that dreamed about a happy and free life with a family.\nDid they hope that one\
  \ day the sun rays would ever bring them joy again? That the bulky gramophone would\
  \ gather family members at the holiday table and the little girl would put on a\
  \ bright dress instead of prison uniform.\n\nThis is the place where the most mass\
  \ destruction of people took place in history. This should be seen with your own\
  \ eyes, and it should stay as a reminder and a warning to descendants. Because \u201C\
  Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\u201D"
