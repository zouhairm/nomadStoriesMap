Text: "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the wind anymore. It\u2019s not windy like that\
  \ this time of year. Not here. Then what is that rumbling sound that woke me up?\
  \ That angry, deep, devastating sound? My bare feet touch the floor as I reach for\
  \ the curtain, and for the first time I can rally feel the movements of the earth\
  \ beneath me. It\u2019s a terremoto. The earth is angry, and it\u2019s letting us\
  \ know. \nI grab the keys, a half-empty bottle of Cola, the sheet on my bed, I don\u2019\
  t know what else to bring. The lock on my door keeps moving, but I get out, and\
  \ get downstairs. Outside the hotel is a large group of people, some in pyjamas,\
  \ some in clothes, some, like my mother, with only a blanket wrapped around them.\
  \ No one screams. No one speaks. There is no sound, except for the constant roar\
  \ from beneath. \nIt had never crossed my mind that a terremoto would have such\
  \ a roaring sound. But it makes sense, when you think of it. The earth, the most\
  \ steady and concrete substance we humans deal with in our day-to-day life, is moving.\
  \ Dancing. Shaking us out of our comfort zones. How can something so natural feel\
  \ so unsafe? It feels like a demonstration of strength, a declaration of war. Or\
  \ is it just a reminder? A pick on the shoulder, so that we don\u2019t forget who\
  \ the real boss is? \nThere\u2019s nothing we can do but wait. Some people move\
  \ their cars away from possible dangerous areas, some evacuate. We sit on the ground.\
  \ It doesn\u2019t make much of a difference what you do. When the rumbling finally\
  \ stops, we wait for the next round. In the silence that follows we can hear the\
  \ sea again. Big, heavy waves hitting the shore. Washing the sand clean. \n\u201C\
  Coffee?\u201D a uniformed woman smiles down at me. I am sincerely confused. \u201C\
  Or tea?\u201D she continues. I don\u2019t know what to say. Do I want coffee? Or\
  \ tea for that matter? \u201CWhisky?\u201D  Now we\u2019re talking. She pours me\
  \ a glass and continues her mission around the group of guests, like a stewardess\
  \ managing her passengers. A thousand terremotos wouldn\u2019t have been half as\
  \ absurd as this. We don\u2019t have cellular connection. No running water. No electricity.\
  \ But the hotel staff is serving coffee. Tea. Whiskey. Some humans work, even when\
  \ the ground is shaking."
