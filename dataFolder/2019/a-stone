Text: "I am sitting on a fortress wall above an abandon town in the humid hot air\
  \ of inland Portugal. Kids run around below me in the old courtyard. I didn't expect\
  \ Portugal to be so beautiful. The orange shingles and stone walls of the historic\
  \ villages help them blend into the landscape of tan and green. I look up at the\
  \ beautiful blue July sky as I tilt my head back to rest it against the stone wall\
  \ behind me. I can almost feel the history speaking to me as I touch the centuries\
  \ old stone that I'm leaning against. I can nearly feel the hundreds of people of\
  \ the past who left their imprint upon this one spot. It is a comfortable place\
  \ here: shaded, over looking the valley, and warm. I feel my eyelids drifting closed\
  \ and I give into sleep like day gives way to night. \n\nWhat is that noise. Who\
  \ is talking? My eyes snap open. A young man is leaning over me his brown hair is\
  \ shoulder length and slightly ruffled. He says something in Portuguese so I shake\
  \ my head while asking for English. He continues with his ramble his eyes seem terrified.\
  \ I feel a cold sweat breaking out he is looking for something, running his fingers\
  \ along the wall behind me tracing the stone edges. Why is he freaking out? \n\n\
  I hear the sound of approaching feet, many feet. They are running toward us but\
  \ I can't see who is approaching yet. The young man lets out a sigh of relief which\
  \ causes me to look back up where he was tracing the stones. He pushes the left\
  \ side of one stone and the right side rotates outward. He then digs his hand into\
  \ the purse looking bag hanging off his left side. Withdrawing it full of something\
  \ shiney and I hear many different pieces slide out of his hand into the chamber.\
  \ He does this several times but my attention has been drawn to his clothing. He\
  \ wears interesting baggy white pants and a long flowy shirt of white. He is barefoot\
  \ and his bag is barley two pieces of clothing sewed together. He abruptly swings\
  \ the hidding spot door closed and begins running down the wall in the opposite\
  \ direction of the approaching footsteps that are nearly in sight. Almost immediately\
  \ four men dressed in even more interesting attire: black tight pants, knee high\
  \ black boots, and white long sleeve shirts came around the corner. I stood up as\
  \ to let them go by but they didn't even seem to notice me. \n\nThey followed in\
  \ hot pursuit of the young man and they to disappeared out of sight. I took off\
  \ after them trying to keep up but when I caught sight of them again they were holding\
  \ the young man down on the ground. They bound his hands together with a rope, picked\
  \ him up, and started back toward me. Panicked I took a step back to get out of\
  \ sight but my foot planted in thin air and I fell. \n\nI woke up with a gasp and\
  \ the sensation I was still falling. I dug my nails into the stone on both sides\
  \ of me to ground myself and clear the dizziness from my head. I was sitting in\
  \ the same spot the sun had shifted in the sky but it was still warm. I was drenched\
  \ in sweat head to toe. Slowly I stood up, careful to stay away from the edge. I\
  \ sat for many minutes attempting to clear my head.\n\nI placed my hand on the wall\
  \ to held balance myself as I stood up. The stone shifted under my hand. I pressed\
  \ on the left side of the stone and the right side swung outward. I felt the cool\
  \ chills creeping up my back as I lifted myself to look inside. There lay several\
  \ handfuls of glittering stones. I had not expected to find treasure. I brought\
  \ one stone out a deep blue rock with jagged edges. I placed it in my pocket just\
  \ to remember. Then I closed the door and walked down the path and down the mountain."
