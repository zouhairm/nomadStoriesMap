Text: "The most shocking episode of my travels happened in the border from Bulgaria\
  \ to Serbia. All of the passengers jumped out of the train to get some fresh air.\
  \  Right then, it happened the most surreal experience of my trip:\n\nA group of\
  \ around 10 people, with darkish skin, humble clothes and big bags of luggage, were\
  \ running for their lives passing right in front of the passport control office.\
  \ Four officers chased them down, shouted at them, hit them on their legs and forced\
  \ them to run back the way they came from while they were running right behind them\
  \ still hitting them on their legs. \n\nI was in shock. I had questions; why are\
  \ they running? am I in danger? should I be running? I felt their fear for a split\
  \ second and it was terrifying. And then I realized they were refugees and that\
  \ this is how we deal with \"migrations\", like savage animals protecting our territory.\
  \ But . . . we claim to be a civilized society, then, why don't we act like it?\
  \ \n\nA French backpacker that was right by my side screamed to one of the officers:\
  \ \u201CWhat are you doing to these people? Why are you hitting these people? -\
  \ the officer was ignoring him- Excuse me! WHY YOU DO THAT TO THOSE PEOPLE? THEY\
  \ ARE HUMANS!\u201D Meanwhile, the officer was uncomfortably smiling. Another traveller\
  \ from our train responded from the distance, in English: \u201CBecause they are\
  \ fucking refugees trying to get into my country- he was Serbian- fuck no! fucking\
  \ refugees \u2026\u201D \n\nWe saw them with our own eyes, they were two meters\
  \ away from us, they were being hit just because they were trying to get into a\
  \ country, by foot, with all their heavy belongings on their backs. \n\nWe were\
  \ called on the train again and given our passports back. When the officer gave\
  \ the passport to the French guy, the only one that had confronted the officers,\
  \ he said: \u201CIt\u2019s not okay what you have done to these people! Hitting\
  \ them and treating them violently \u2026 This won\u2019t stay like this, I will\
  \ let people know about this situation \u2026\u201D- said the French guy. \u201C\
  Are you sure I was doing that?\u201D-said in a threatening voice tone the officer.\
  \ The French guy responded: \u201CWell ... if you weren\u2019t doing that you can\
  \ tell your friends that they shouldn\u2019t \u2026\u201D-he was interrupted by\
  \ the officer. \u201CWHAT? I CAN TELL MY FRIENDS? WHAT AM I THE MESSENGER? AM I\
  \ THE MESSENGER?\u201D- he had an exaggerated response, screaming like a madman\
  \ in broken English. The French guy was quiet, probably shocked by this reaction.\
  \ The officer left the wagon and came a second after, holding the door open. - \u201C\
  DO YOU WANT TO GO TELL THEM? GET OFF THE TRAIN! YOU STAY HERE AND YOU TELL THEM!\u201D\
  - The officer was threatening him to stay inland. The French guy remained in his\
  \ seat and that was the end of this horrible episode. \n\nI reckon European governments\
  \ would accept the death of thousands of Syrians just so that they won't have to\
  \ spend money on saving them. \nHello capitalism, goodbye humanity."
