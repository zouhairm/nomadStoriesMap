Text: "It's just a garden, a famous botanical garden that was there since the British\
  \ invasion in Java. I've been visiting this garden  since in elementary school since\
  \ it's a popular spot for school educational tour, also for church picnics or family\
  \ gatherings. That afternoon it seems different. It's just a casual group tour with\
  \ some new friends. But as I walked there,  along with other people and their own\
  \ groups, looking at those tall trees. It feels for a few moments that time stopped.\
  \ These silent trees were like taking me somewhere in the past, where the automobiles\
  \ were horse drawn carriages. Where the European girls walked there wore long dresses\
  \ and some Javanese girls in their kebaya. Time surely flies. \nHere,  back in our\
  \ time, we girls in T-shirts,  jeans and sneakers, I heard our tour guide talked\
  \ about the presidents and prime ministers that had lunch here in this garden. And\
  \ gone are the girls and their old time outfits. Though in old Dutch cemetery there,\
  \  some said that they still made an appearance sometimes. \nThis pretty garden,\
  \ that I visited many times in the past for study purpose and for picnics, somehow\
  \ took me to the past, though it's only for a second. \nMany famous paintings and\
  \ songs were made inspired by a beautiful garden. But this time, let me just quoted\
  \ a song from Indonesia's KLA Project. \n\"Wahai alam dekaplah jiwaku\nGelisah dan\
  \ mencari\nDi langit ingin ku basuh wajahku.. \"\n\n(Dear nature, hug my soul, \n\
  My unresting and seeking soul\nLet me wash my face in the sky..) \n\nActually, I\
  \ want to sing The Garden from Elvis Presley. But maybe later, if I can catch the\
  \ earliest  train."
