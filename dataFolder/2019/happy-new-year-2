Text: "In August of 2016 I went to Spain for six months of exchange program, in the\
  \ end of December my Brazilians friends Bia, Gabi, Maju, my Mexican friend Alba\
  \ and I went to Budapest, Hungary, to the New Year\u2019s eve. \nWe were leaving\
  \ the hotel to go to a party and Alba asked: \u201Cdid someone take the keys?\u201D\
  \ and one of the girls said: \u201Cyes, I did\u201D, then we left. We arrived at\
  \ the party, there was good food, nice people and great music, I remember that was\
  \ playing Reggaeton and somebody asked for Brazilians songs, we danced a lot, met\
  \ new friends and had a blast! \nAt 11:59 everybody ran outside to the countdown,\
  \ at midnight the fireworks started, it was really beautiful, people were thrilled,\
  \ hugging each other, saying happy New Year even for unknown and besides all this\
  \ I was thinking about the year before, about what happened, about what I have done\
  \ or should have done and what was expecting for me in 2017.\nAt about 1 a.m. Alba\
  \ took the keys with our friend and we came back to the hotel and our friends went\
  \ to another party with a Brazilian group they have met. When we arrived at the\
  \ hotel the key we had wasn\u2019t the front door's one, it was the room\u2019s\
  \ door, so we couldn\u2019t come in because the reception was closed at that time.\
  \ So Alba and I rang the bell for 1 hour hoping someone woke up to open the door\
  \ but no one did it, so we sat on the floor to wait our friends so we could stay\
  \ together or somebody who had the key to open the door, but it was winter, -11\xB0\
  C, we were freezing outside, we couldn\u2019t feel our extremity like hands and\
  \ feet, so we searched on the internet a place to go, there was few options, almost\
  \ every place was closed of course, because it was New Year.\nThe closest place\
  \ we found was a Subway restaurant. The place was small, there was few tables left\
  \ so we sat in the first we saw, it was between Italians and French guys, suddenly\
  \ they started to talk loud to each other about soccer, food, culture and a fight\
  \ started and we were literally in the middle. The waiter didn\u2019t know what\
  \ to do so he kicked everyone out, including Alba and I because he thought we were\
  \ involved in the fight. At 3 a.m. we were on the street again and Alba was shaking,\
  \ so we hugged, but it wasn\u2019t enough, she started to talk about hypothermia\
  \ and searched the symptoms on Google, we also searched another place to go, then\
  \ we found the KFC restaurant, it was far but was the closest to us.\nWe stayed\
  \ there for hours, we asked for cappuccinos, what helped to warm us up a little\
  \ bit, but it was still cold inside, we were tired, almost sleeping on the table,\
  \ Alba couldn\u2019t even walk anymore. At 6 a.m. I took Alba\u2019s cell phone\
  \ because it was the only one that had internet and I would need it to find the\
  \ way back to the hotel and I gave my cell phone for her so she could connect it\
  \ to the KFC Wi-Fi and we could keep talking.\nI started my way back to the hotel,\
  \ I had to try again, and when I arrived there the door was still closed, I rang\
  \ the bell and surprise, a man finally opened the door! I sent a message to Alba:\
  \ \u201Cthe door is open!\u201D and she came in a hurry, she arrived with a big\
  \ smile and a tired face just like me, and she was still holding her cappuccino\
  \ which had turned into ice. \nSome minutes later our friends arrived from the party\
  \ and we told them what happened, we laughed a lot together and we were sure that\
  \ 2017 would be a great year because any day could be worse than that night, and\
  \ nothing, even the cold weather, would stop us because we were stronger and ready\
  \ to leave the hotel, Budapest and Hungary at 8 a.m. and go to our next adventure,\
  \ Berlin, Germany."
