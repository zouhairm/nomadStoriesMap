Text: "He had his eye on me from the second our truck rolled through the gates. Perched\
  \ regally on a rock at the entrance to Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, he waited patiently\
  \ as my two travel companions disembarked. Then, with the speed and agility of a\
  \ Papio ursinus half his size, the baboon bounded up to the truck and snatched my\
  \ purse out of my hands.\n\nThe thief returned to his rock, deftly opened the bag\u2019\
  s compartments and flicked away the items deemed unnecessary: passport, sunglasses,\
  \ tampons. Then, inventory complete, he took my little red bag in his mouth and\
  \ ran into the forest.\n\nI leaped out of the truck and made a beeline for the galloping\
  \ primate, only to halt amid cries of, \u201CNo, madam, no!\u201D Workers in the\
  \ park explained how dangerous these animals are, and to please not worry, they\
  \ would retrieve the bag themselves. Then, armed with nets and alarming confidence,\
  \ they marched into the forest. I trailed after them, still reeling. After living\
  \ in New York for years, I was only now experiencing my first mugging.\n\nThe rush\
  \ of the falls grew louder as we trekked deeper into the forest. A cool cloud of\
  \ mist washed over us. Through the lush greenery, the mammoth falls roared into\
  \ sight and stopped me in my tracks. Without any obvious beginning or end, the layers\
  \ of water poured relentlessly, lifting up a delicate rainbow over the mist. Living\
  \ up to its Lozi name, it truly was Mosi-oa-Tunya; \u201CThe Smoke that Thunders\u201D\
  .\n\nI felt a crunch beneath my sandal and looked down to see a corner of plastic\
  \ peeking out from under the leaves. A middle-aged Indian man stared out from the\
  \ photo of his national ID card; an apparent relic of an earlier victim. I pocketed\
  \ him and caught up to the men with nets in time to see the baboon disappear down\
  \ a cliff, red bag bobbing in the distance.\n\nAs the startling reality of a trip\
  \ without camera, money and credit cards suddenly hit, I burst into tears. The men\
  \ began to pull the nets back and formed a circle around me. \u201CI'm sorry madam,\
  \ these monkeys, they are fast here. I saw which way he went, did you see? Maybe\
  \ he will come back up later. Yes, we will try again later.\u201D\n\nWith that,\
  \ I headed back to town.\n\nAs Victoria Falls retreated into a cloud of reddish\
  \ smoke, I couldn\u2019t help but notice my sudden calm as I gazed out the window\
  \ of the Jeep. Zambian scenery tends to switch immediately from town to bush, offering\
  \ few clues for travelers as to what they'll see next. Already a stranger in an\
  \ unfamiliar place, and now vulnerable without my bag, there was no choice but to\
  \ accept my fate.\n\nI waited for the town of Livingstone to approach.\n\nThe main\
  \ drag of the city sweeps red dirt on the concrete of the roads and the sidewalks.\
  \ It settles sleepily, a warm layer of dust mixing the smell of clay in the air.\
  \ Sunburned backpackers wait in line at Barclays to exchange their cash for kwacha\
  \ while in the same crowd, babies tied securely to their mothers\u2019 backs snooze\
  \ contently.\n\nWhat mere hours ago seemed so unfamiliar, were now the same sights\
  \ cushioning my fall from that morning\u2019s experience. Bewilderment as to what\
  \ to do next was replaced by acceptance, then laughter.\n\nWhen the park's workers\
  \ would arrive at the hostel gates hours later, and proudly present me with the\
  \ tattered remains of my bag, they would laugh with me too. In between their beaming\
  \ smiles and my eruption of fresh tears, one of them gently patted my shoulder.\
  \ \u201CDon\u2019t worry, miss,\u201D he said. \u201CIt happens all the time.\u201D"
