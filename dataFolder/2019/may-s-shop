Text: "The windows that look onto the street are covered in decade old newspapers.\
  \ Their muted beige and reds outline the cleanly lettered stories long past. In\
  \ all directions their breaking news reads plastered onto the glass. A small sign\
  \ on the barely visible door reads \u201CMay\u2019s alterations\u201D. With a sharp\
  \ hesitant push, the door opens to a news agency long presumed to be extinct. Only\
  \ the regulars with their shaking walking sticks and fumbled coins browse the short\
  \ sparse aisles. Slowly. Fresh papers and sticky notes clash with the brightly coloured\
  \ lotto tickets that are plastered to the unattended counter. From the back of the\
  \ shop, the soft, crackling sound of an unknown language shoots rapid fire sounds\
  \ that explore  philosophy or the weather. \n\nMy feet are quiet on the linoleum\
  \ floor as I approach the small room visible through the windows in the separating\
  \ wall. The room is barely a couple of metres squared but clothes fill every millimeter\
  \ in various stages of repair or disrepair. Suits and dresses and plastic coat bags\
  \ on hangers are hooked to every chip and ledge. A sea of blacks and business grey.\
  \ In the corner at a bench sits a small lady. May, it is assumed, wears loose red\
  \ pants and a long sleeved shirt that reveals her wrinkled but strong hands. Her\
  \ hair is cut short in a soft, grey pixie that blends with the clothes in the room.\
  \ Reading a fresh newspaper, she leaves me a second to take in the room before she\
  \ looks up. Silently. It is obvious why I am here. I hold the dress in my hands.\
  \ But she lets me explain anyway. She brushes off my explanations and flutters me\
  \ behind a curtain to change into the dress. \u201CThank you, thank you\u201D she\
  \ says, placing me on a box as she begins to chop at the hem. No hesitation. \n\n\
  As she cuts I offer a tentative question. With a small surprised smile she gently\
  \ tells me her story.  Born in China she moved with her family when she was young\
  \ to a small village in Vietnam. As a child she learnt from her mother to sew and\
  \ embroider. \nShe glances at me proudly. When she became old enough to work she\
  \ started her own school. A school for young girls to learn to embroider bears.\
  \ A quick smile. \n40 years ago, she tells me, she moved to Bondi in Australia then\
  \ to Randwick 13 years ago. And now she fixes clothes. \nHer age is impossible to\
  \ guess and her face gives no hints to the secrets of her history. How did she get\
  \ to Australia? Is she happy here?\n\n $20 she tells me quietly as her price. I\
  \ hand her a crumpled note and she takes it, \u201Cthank you, thank you\u201D she\
  \ says. \nAs I go to leave she looks as me a long time. Finally, she asks if I am\
  \ the girl who came with her father the day before. I shake my head confused, never\
  \ having been in the city before. \nGoodbye I tell her. \nThank you, thank you she\
  \ says."
