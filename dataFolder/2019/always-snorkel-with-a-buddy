Text: "\u201CAlways snorkel with a buddy.\u201D This time, would having a snorkel\
  \ buddy have helped? Perhaps we might have spotted it earlier or perhaps, if push\
  \ came to shove, I might have been the stronger swimmer and the one that gets away.\
  \ \n\nThis was our fourth day on Mataray Island. We\u2019d settled into an easy\
  \ routine of breakfast, snorkel/dive, lunch, snorkel/dive, dinner, sleep. Repeat.\
  \ This was an all-meals provided resort on our island paradise. This had been the\
  \ perfect seaside family holiday \u2013 with weather to match. \n\nOur beach villa\
  \ was sited with sea views in mind. When the curtains were drawn back from the glass\
  \ double doors, I could see the water from the bed. The villa was air-conditioned\
  \ and there was even an open-to-the heavens ensuite shower with its footpath of\
  \ stepping-stones in a bed of sand. Granted, there were the pesky ants that made\
  \ themselves at home in the shower on our second day, but housekeeping soon fixed\
  \ that with a can of bug spray. \n\nI was half-drifting and half-heartedly heading\
  \ out this morning to see how close I could get to the safety rope with its bobbing\
  \ floats barrier that encircled the \u201Csafe\u201D snorkelling zone. The tide\
  \ was not at its lowest, neither was it at its highest. This made for very pleasant\
  \ snorkelling. \n\nWhen it is low tide, you have to float very carefully over the\
  \ coral which starts just a flipper-kick away from shore. Sometimes, when the tide\
  \ is really low, a sign would be erected on the shore informing people to come back\
  \ later. \n\nThe staff had a very commendable conservation attitude to their patch\
  \ of private coral sanctuary. Jacob, a local Fijian diving instructor, built like\
  \ a bronzed Aussie surfer, had shared with me what the staff did regularly. \u201C\
  In our free time, we tidy up the coral. We remove the dead ones and lift up those\
  \ that have fallen over. You have to be careful of stone fish though. They look\
  \ like dead coral.\u201D \n\nWith his warning in mind, I made sure to keep my fingers\
  \ to myself as I immersed myself in the glorious never-ending colourful activity\
  \ of the underwater world. Not all dangerous marine creatures disguised themselves\
  \ as inanimate mineral objects. The rabbitfish with its colourful yellow torso and\
  \ black and white striped face looks too cute to be dangerous. You naturally avoided\
  \ the sea urchins without anyone telling you \u2013 all those long spiky protrusions\
  \ just scream, \u201CKeep away!\u201D \n\nPerhaps someone should have said, \u201C\
  Keep away\u201D to me as I headed further than I\u2019d gone before. And this time,\
  \ by myself. My usual snorkel-buddy a.k.a. my daughter, was too preoccupied with\
  \ making another Fijian shell-and-rope bracelet with Save (pronounced Sa-vae) \u2013\
  \ one of the friendly multi-talented resort staff. Weaving coconut palm baskets,\
  \ tiara-wreaths and fish were part of his repertoire. He also cheerfully swept up\
  \ leaves from the resort jungle-garden\u2019s undergrowth and around the villas\
  \ in the morning with a hibiscus behind his ear. \n\nI loved it that all the staff\
  \ wore hibiscuses or frangipanis behind their ears. Our regular waiter looked perfect\
  \ with his bead necklace and neatly pressed shirt matched with a simple dun coloured\
  \ sulu.  \n\nI was trying to recall how to say the appropriate Fijian greeting to\
  \ him on our second last morning on the resort when I spotted what looked like a\
  \ 2m long water-laden log lying on the sandy sea floor. I\u2019d snorkelled out\
  \ so far that I\u2019d reached the edge of the prolific coral reef and reached what\
  \ the locals called \u201Cthe drop\u201D. Visibility wasn\u2019t great there. \n\
  \nHmm... I thought, that log has an uncanny resemblance to a shark. I paused, I\
  \ froze. I peered through the murkiness and tried to discern its outline. If it\u2019\
  s a log, it\u2019s a damn-good shark-shaped log. \n\nSuddenly, the \u201Clog\u201D\
  \ swished its tail and darted off towards the sea. My heart almost seized up. \n\
  \nI swam in a gentle back-pedal towards land. I thought I might have more chance\
  \ of defending myself if I could see it coming (!). \n\nI made it to shallow water\
  \ and decided it was time for lunch anyway. \u201CNi sa yan-dra\u201D was past,\
  \ it was time to practice saying \u201CNi sa Bula\u201D."
