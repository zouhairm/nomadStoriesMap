Text: "It's 3am in Paris. I am ignominiously stranded outside the Gare de\_l'Est train\
  \ station without any money, phone or French skills, and one expired train ticket\
  \ in my pocket. Things aren\u2019t looking good. \n\nThe night hadn\u2019t started\
  \ off so drastically. My boyfriend and I, in France for just a few days, had gone\
  \ out dancing with some mates.  My vigorous dancing had broken the strap on my delicate\
  \ purse. No worries! My boyfriend simply stowed it in his backpack. As a chronic\
  \ over-packer, I was especially enjoying this bagless freedom. \n\nWe were staying\
  \ at a friend\u2019s apartment, and at 2am we called it a night and set off towards\
  \ his place. He gave us precise instructions for the bus home, but as a directionally-challenged\
  \ Anglophone, one detail I had memorised was the station: Gare du Nord. So when\
  \ I heard the bus driver bark \u201CGare de\u2026\u201D, like Merv Hughes I was\
  \ primed for action. I leapt out of my seat and off the bus with impressive agility.\
  \ I was so fast that my boyfriend was still sitting there, staring at me as the\
  \ doors shut and the bus pulled out. Uh-oh. Turns out this was Gare de l\u2019Est.\
  \ \n\nUsing bushwalkers\u2019 logic, I decided to stay put until I was found. After\
  \ all, I didn\u2019t have anything on me. Where could I go? But it was a warm September\
  \ night and the streets were dotted with partygoers stumbling home- everything will\
  \ be fine, I thought. I\u2019ll just wait.  \n\nHalf an hour passed, then another.\
  \ As the clock neared 3, I started to lose my confidence. There was no hint of dawn\
  \ in the sky, but there were creepy guys straying into my self-appointed \u201C\
  safe zone\u201D outside the train station. As the night wore on and the streets\
  \ started emptying of revellers I felt my bravado crumbling. Having literally nothing\
  \ left to lose except my dignity, I started crying. It wasn\u2019t a discreet little\
  \ tear either, more like passionate Gallic weeping. Where could I go? What could\
  \ I do?  \n\nAt this point, I was approached by two dignified-looking African men\
  \ cloaked in traditional robes; one tall, one short. Having already fended off a\
  \ few creepers during my wait, I was wary but exhausted. To be fair, I was also\
  \ crying loudly. \n\n\u201CAre you ok?\u201D, the short one asked. \n\n\u201CI\u2019\
  m stuck here!\u201D I sniffed. \u201CMy boyfriend has all my stuff and I don\u2019\
  t know where I am! Or where he is. And, you know, je ne parle pas francais!\u201D\
  \n\nBut instead of making some lewd proposition, these men looked concerned. \u201C\
  Do you know his number? You can borrow my phone to call him\u201D the tall one offered.\
  \ \n\nA new wave of haplessness gripped me. \u201CNo! Argh! I\u2026I don\u2019t\
  \ know it.\u201D\n\nHe looked thoughtful. \u201CWhat about...your mother\u2019s\
  \ number?\u201D \n\nHope outweighed any potential sheepishness as I considered explaining\
  \ everything to my mum. I summoned the landline in my mind, a number I\u2019d dialled\
  \ a thousand times before the mobile age. \n\nAfter two rings, I heard my mum\u2019\
  s angelic voice pick up the phone. In a garbled rehash I explained the situation\
  \ (prefacing it with the phrase every parent wants to hear: \u201CDon\u2019t panic\
  \ but\u201D). Mum laughed and promised to call my boyfriend and tell him where to\
  \ find me.  \n\nThe two kindly Senegalese men waited with me until my frazzled boyfriend\
  \ turned up 10 minutes later, relieved and puzzled to find our unlikely trio. \n\
  \nAt a loss for words, all I could do was thank them. I felt endlessly grateful\
  \ for the kindness of strangers, especially ones I had met at the end of my tether,\
  \ hopelessly lost.   \n\n\u201CMy sister, we are all strangers here. Of course we\
  \ help you! We need to look out for each other\u201D, the tall man explained as\
  \ we parted ways. Later I learned that they even called my mum back the next day,\
  \ to check in on me. To those kind men whose names I never learned, all I can say\
  \ is: thank you. Thank you for your generosity, your company, and most importantly,\
  \ your phone."
