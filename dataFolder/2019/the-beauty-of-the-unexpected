Text: "One day I quit my job, sold my car, my camera, my clothes and bought a ticket\
  \ to Spain. As I writer I felt imprisoned, stucked on a rut and kind of blue, dreaming\
  \ always of seeing what's further beyond home, so I made this life changing event\
  \ to basically see what will happen if I travel to unknown places I have not always\
  \ wanted to visit, but the journey lead me there.\n\nIt started in September, few\
  \ days after my birthday, and took a flight to Barcelona. My cousins lived there\
  \ then and we planned this crazy journey through Europe, just pointing at the map\
  \ and going all the way there. At the beggining my expectations about every place\
  \ and person were very high, the way I imagined of what I have read or see, an unreal\
  \ image that felt very comfortable in my head. So I decided to not take the touristy\
  \ route. I took all the free local tours every city I visit. \n\nFirst I explored\
  \ myself the Catalan city, enjoying the last days of Summer: strolling through Parc\
  \ G\xFCell, catching sunsets at Badalona's beach, and later having a couple of beers\
  \ at Nevermind's skate-bar. But the cozy warm weather ended when we took a plane\
  \ to Oslo, that was our first offical stop from this amazing trip. I remember seeing\
  \ the green sceneries from my window as we flew over the magical Norway. After it,\
  \ train rides were common, exhausting and incredibly fun. I was never bored and\
  \ saw the most amazing sceneries; the ones I saw once in movies were getting better\
  \ and real, of course. Stockholm, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Tallin, Riga,\
  \ Vilnius, Warsaw, Krakow, Berlin, Paris, Bratislava, Budapest, Bucarest... it has\
  \ been almost two months travelling.\n\nI was tired and it was colder. The broders\
  \ of almost all Eastern Europe countries were restricted and that meant no international\
  \ trains. So I was stucked in Bucarest among all these gray Soviet buildings, malls,\
  \ a lot of people and 1 euro beers. Finally, at the train central station a grumpy\
  \ lady told me there was just one train to Budapest so I can cointue my journey,\
  \ the only \"thing\" was it was a regional one. It stopped almost 20 or 30 times\
  \ until Hungary, and then I has just few minutes to take another to Ljublana (included\
  \ on my trip ticket, because I was travelling on a budget and by that time it was\
  \ loooow). I made it. Went to this beautiful medieval city with lots of art exhibitions,\
  \ museums, poets and local markets. I really liked here. \n\nI wanted to go to Craotia\
  \ but political conflcits such as the Paris terrosits attack and the Syrian war\
  \ migration wave were obstacles i wasn't prepared for. So I switch the plan and\
  \ go to Italy. As all the international train lines were suspended and by bus it\
  \ was too expensive for me, I got on Bla Bla Car and took a ride with some Serbian\
  \ guys who were heading to Florence. They picked me up near my hostel at 4am. They\
  \ didn't know any English or Spanish, just Serbian. The were travelling in a van\
  \ full of other people. I sit in the front and fell asleep immediately. When I woke\
  \ up we were in Venice, outside everything looked foggy, not as I expected Venice\
  \ would look like. \n\n20 hours later we were in Florence, the guys were very nice\
  \ persons finding my hostel through the chaotic Tuscan city. At the end nothing\
  \ was what I expected. I thought my life would be in danger maybe, but this things\
  \ made me more trustful about my intuitons and sixth sense. By that time I was so\
  \ relieved I have had finally a bed to sleep and real food. I spent the whole trip\
  \ worrying about my budget so I decided to enjoy the last days. I went for a gelato,\
  \ watch the carrousel at night and bought some grapes, cheese and wine at the store.\
  \ Later that night, I toasted for everything I have known, grateful about having\
  \ a warm place to stay and for making such good friends along the way."
