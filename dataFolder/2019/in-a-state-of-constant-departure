Text: "The crinkle of plastic-covered tablecloths and slushing of mid-day daiquiris\
  \ tickled my ears. I was eating alone, waiting for something to happen to me. I\u2019\
  d been 4 days in Havana without having the guts to make a friend. This was my eighth\
  \ solo meal. At once anticipating and fearing the possibility of meeting someone\
  \ new, I was unable to shake the feeling that I was being watched. I stared down\
  \ at my ropa vieja \u2013 its flavor bleeding into the white of the rice. \n\nIt\
  \ seemed to me AMERICAN was stamped on my forehead and I was trying my best to obscure\
  \ it. I eventually looked up from my plate and noticed a young man at another table.\
  \ He asked if I\u2019d like to join him.  As a woman alone, there\u2019s always\
  \ the worry that an interaction with a male stranger could wind up badly. Yet, this\
  \ man appeared soft and warm in his approach and so I felt I could trust him. \n\
  \nWe immediately bonded over travel and movies - realizing that they each had something\
  \ to do with our love of movement. I told him I liked going places, whether there\
  \ was a destination or not. The point was to go. After finishing our cafecitos but\
  \ not our conversation, we decided to roam Havana\u2019s streets together.  \n\n\
  Through streets smelling of clay, coffee, and smoke, we made our way to the Plaza\
  \ Vieja. Outside a caf\xE9 - situated between sandstone pillars \u2013 was a woman\
  \ we\u2019d both seen before. When you type \u201CSanter\xEDa Priestess\u201D into\
  \ Google Images, her face makes several appearances. (Nowhere, can you find her\
  \ name.) Crossing before her altar of white lace, we watched as a British couple\
  \ snapped her photo. The couple then made to leave, but the Priestess rose up from\
  \ her shrine and asked to be paid. The wife laughed the request off and quickly\
  \ ushered her husband out of the town square. \n\nThe scene made me and my new friend\
  \ sick. The Priestess hadn\u2019t received her due and the culprits had gotten away\
  \ with it - thinking they had done nothing criminal. Except, of course, they had.\
  \ They\u2019d taken her image, expecting to give nothing in return - perhaps feeling\
  \ as if they had a right to do so \u2013 and thereby violently enacted their privilege\
  \ as tourists.  As tourists ourselves, we bowed our heads in shame when dropping\
  \ a few pesos into her bowl. We weren\u2019t na\xEFve enough to think that our donation\
  \ made the situation any better. If anything, it was an attempt to quell our guilt\
  \ about being bystanders. \n\nAfterward, we sat on the steps of the Catedral de\
  \ San Crist\xF3bal and were approached by an old man. With his guitar, he sang us\
  \ a love song - alternating between Spanish and English. Once he finished, he showed\
  \ us a worn photo of him and his daughter. He said that years ago, he had been deported\
  \ from Miami, separated from his family, and was now unable to return for financial\
  \ and political reasons. We offered another small donation, knowing yet again how\
  \ futile our attempts at \u201Cgiving\u201D were. I felt guilty for the fact that\
  \ I could afford to move as I chose and he could not. I was quiet most of the time\
  \ he spoke, unsure of what to say.\n\nBut when he asked if we were a couple I let\
  \ out a breathy laugh. My friend said, \u201CNo, we met today.\u201D \nThe old man\
  \ replied, \u201CSo you\u2019re not a couple, but you look like you know each other.\u201D\
  \ \nMy friend insisted, \u201CNo, not yet.\u201D By the end of the day, I think\
  \ we did. And perhaps we came to know a little more about our places in the world\
  \ as self-proclaimed nomads. Since that day, I haven\u2019t seen the old man - nor\
  \ the young one. \n\nLeaving Havana, I felt heavier. As I continue to travel - to\
  \ move freely \u2013 I carry with me a mixed-feeling. It\u2019s a feeling of guilt\
  \ and of gratitude, born from uneven experiences of brief cultural exchanges. Yet\
  \ still, I go - seeking out strangers in the hope of connecting."
