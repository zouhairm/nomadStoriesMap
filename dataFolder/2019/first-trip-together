Text: "My boyfriend and I had been planning our first trip together for a while, to\
  \ San Cristobal de las Casas in southern Mexico. We had been working hard, and needed\
  \ a time for us. We were excited for this occasion, though things turned out quite\
  \ different as expected.\n\nFirst, the bus towards San Cristobal stopped in the\
  \ highway for over an hour without a reason. We were afraid it might have a failure,\
  \ so we would have to return to the start point and drive all over again. Eventually\
  \ the drive resumed. On top of that, during the whole drive there were kids sitting\
  \ next of us walking to and fro, making noises for hours, so we were much relieved\
  \ when finally arrived. It was midnight, the city was silent and cold. We walked\
  \ to our hostel, and it turned out the place no longer existed, though we had already\
  \ paid it using a website. By the moment I already wanted to go back home, things\
  \ seemed to be all messed up. We walked to the next hostel, and fortunately it had\
  \ a bedroom available. We stayed there overnight, while asking for a refund. \n\n\
  Next morning, after a long time spent by the phone we got our refund and were able\
  \ to book a new place for the remaining nights. From that moment on things were\
  \ different. We walked around town enjoying the amazing food and admiring the architecture.\
  \ Finally it was our moment to chill.\n\nThe next day we decided to visit an archeological\
  \ site two hours away. We sat in the bus and had to wait for a long while before\
  \ departing, because the driver waited until it was full of passengers. We departed\
  \ quite late. In the bus there was a woman sitting close to us, yelling at the phone\
  \ for over half an hour. No one seemed to care about it. I was quite upset and wanted\
  \ to ask her to lower her volume. Right before speaking with her the call ended\
  \ and we were able to enjoy the ride through the woods. \n\nAt the archeological\
  \ site it seemed that nothing could bother us any more. We were in a beatiful place\
  \ and such small annoyances suddenly seemed unworthy of our worry. That night we\
  \ went to a wonderful bistro and we had the most amazing dinner, and right after\
  \ we celebrated New Year's Eve. Everything was so perfect. By the moment I even\
  \ found funny all those situations  I had found so terrible, they meant nothing.\
  \ The people was celebrating around us, they all looked joyful. The only thing that\
  \ mattered was the present moment, the past was gone. Everything was perfect."
