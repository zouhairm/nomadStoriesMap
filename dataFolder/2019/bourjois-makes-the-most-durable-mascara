Text: "Copacabana was not a good place to die that day. Rocinha. City of God. A paragliding\
  \ hill overseeing Niteroi. Plenty of places to die properly in Rio de Janeiro. Not\
  \ Copacabana, not on one of the sunnier days that winter. An older guy in a red\
  \ hawaiian t-shirt selling buttered corn, a middle-aged woman making tapiocas, favela\
  \ kids begging for money, or food, or weed, or just cigarettes ma\u2019am please\
  \ - I wouldn\u2019t want to ruin their morning.\nThe sun was comfortably covered\
  \ by clouds. People\u2019s hands were sticky with fresh coconut milk and spilled\
  \ caipirinha. Bitter maracuja seeds had to be spit out on the sand, where plastic\
  \ cups were lying full of warm beer and melted a\xE7a\xED.\n- This is the brazilian\
  \ tanning secret. - Carolina spread her black and white towel in front of me - You\
  \ have to be facing the sun.\nAnd so I did. Blond, white, in my giant sunglasses\
  \ and a red bikini, lying on an \u201Ci love brazil\u201D towel. Gringa. Young and\
  \ wild, only 23. Ready for the danger.\n- Should we go to the water sometime soon?\
  \ - I leaned towards my mulatto friend after a good minute. We met on a bench in\
  \ Ipanema, turns out she was moving to Wroclaw next year.\n- You go first, I will\
  \ join. - she said without looking at me. Her big hair needed a dark skin entourage\
  \ and it was an emergency.\nSo I went. Polish girl from a lake district, taking\
  \ her first steps in the ocean. The water was cold as expected. My feet recognized\
  \ a familiar ground but got shy with slight salty tingle. I took small, steady steps.\
  \ I was standing, halfway in the water, halfway in the hot sun, experiencing two\
  \ sensations at the same time. Here I was, in Brazil, when a month ago I was only\
  \ contemplating going for a week holiday in Romania. First time on the american\
  \ continent, free and uninhabitated, meeting new people, learning new ways of life\
  \ and breathing a wonderfully clean, tropical air.\nThe ocean was inviting me and\
  \ I complied. I threw my arms in the air and jumped in the water. It felt salty,\
  \ it felt cold but it felt alive. I was moving my muscles, feeling my entire body,\
  \ remembering being in a lake. I felt strong and invincible. I didn\u2019t even\
  \ notice when I found myself far away from the beach, behind the waves that were\
  \ growing stronger and stronger.\n\u201CIt is all good\u201D I thought to myself\
  \ \u201CI only have to be faster than the waves\u201D\nI turned around and started\
  \ swimming towards the beach. Suddenly, I felt the water running away rapidly from\
  \ underneath me. I looked back and in the second I saw a huge wave behind I took\
  \ a deep breath.\nThe wave swept me in. I was weightless. No amount of fighting\
  \ would change my position. All I could do was counting the seconds until my lungs\
  \ were empty.\n\u201CIs that it?\u201D ran through my head \u201CIs that the punishment\
  \ for my greed? For being in Brazil, when I rather belong in Romania?\u201D\nThe\
  \ wave lift me up, pulled me in and pushed me away, bored of playing with my weightless\
  \ body. When my lungs went dry, suddenly I was out. I looked up and saw another\
  \ wave coming.\n\u201CThis is the end\u201D I thought when taking another deep breath\
  \ \u201CThat\u2019s for not jogging when I should, for not being nice to my parents,\
  \ for being annoyed with combing my bunny\u201D\nI knew I would not take the third\
  \ one. This had to be the last one.\nAnd it was. Seconds before loosing my consciousness\
  \ I was beached and Carolina was running towards me.\n- Is my mascara ok? - I asked\
  \ before falling on the golden dust of Copacabana beach.\nI couldn\u2019t die, I\
  \ wouldn\u2019t do that to the tapioca lady. That day left me exhausted, confused\
  \ and fearing the ocean. It made me careful and reckless, scared and ready for life.\n\
  My life was new. Brand new, until the next day, in Rocinha, when the sun was rising\
  \ and the corn was sweet and the football was on tv and that kid was killed."
