Text: "I was dating an Israeli man who was living in the United States. His name was\
  \ Asaf. He had gone home to visit his family for a month and convinced me to come\
  \ for a visit. \"Israel is one of the most beautiful places in the world. You must\
  \ come!\" That was all the convincing I needed.\n\nThe morning after my arrival,\
  \ Asaf and I were drinking coffee in the kitchen while his mom was whipping up breakfast\
  \ for us. Asaf inquired about what I wanted to do that day. I told him I wanted\
  \ to visit The Dead Sea. Asaf protested. \"It's boring. We grew up with it here\
  \ so it's not a big deal to us.\" I looked at him with disappointment in my eyes.\
  \ His mom quickly chimed in \"Asaf!\" She spoke to him in Hebrew in a stern voice.\
  \ Asaf looked at me and said \"We'll go to the Dead Sea. It is what you want to\
  \ do and you came all this way for me.\"  We ate the delicious breakfast Esther\
  \ prepared for us and got ready to go.\n\nWe arrived at the resort. The view was\
  \ truly majestic. The water flowed with vibrant hues of blues and greens. I could\
  \ see rock formations off in the distance. The sky seemed almost perfectly still\
  \ for a moment. I was in one of the most serene places I had ever visited. \n\n\
  The resort we were at had a designated area where guests were meant to stay. \"\
  Let's go over there where there's no other people.\" Asaf said. \"Babe, we're supposed\
  \ to stay over here. That's why no one else is over there.\" I replied. Asaf smirked\
  \ and responded with \"It's fine. We're in Israel. We do what we want here. Don't\
  \ worry!\" I was concerned. I'm a person who tends to follow the rules and Asaf\
  \ seemed to love testing these boundaries. I trailed behind him as he ran with excitement\
  \ to the area we weren't supposed to be in. The resort started sounding off a siren.\
  \ \"Asaf! They're doing that because of us. We need to turn around.\" I told him.\
  \ \"No they're not. It's fine. They'll come get us if we can't be here. You worry\
  \ too much.\" He responded. We arrived into the area we were forbidden from going\
  \ to and waded into the water. I felt the sand and mud between my toes, the sun\
  \ on my skin, and the warm water splashing against my legs. I laid down to float\
  \ in the water and instantly sprung up. The Dead Sea was truly incredible! I was\
  \ floating in this water without any effort on my behalf. My worries had completely\
  \ subsided. I thought to myself it couldn't get more relaxing than this.\n\nEventually,\
  \ I got out of the water to take photos and videos of the magical view. Suddenly\
  \ I hear, \"Tricia! Grab my hand! I'm sinking!\" I glanced over at Asaf nonchalantly.\
  \ I knew he enjoyed poking fun and getting an uprise out of me. \"I'm sinking!\"\
  \ Asaf exclaimed. I felt sheer panic for this time I knew he was serious. I sprinted\
  \ to the water and got to him as fast as I could. I reached in to pull him out.\
  \ He tried to grab my hand, but slipped away. I shot my hand out again. Our hands\
  \ slipped apart again. I moved closer to him, but felt myself starting to sink as\
  \ well. I was determined to save him. I was going to get him out or we were both\
  \ going down together. I flung my hand out again. This time our hands locked firmly\
  \ and I was somehow able to pull him out, despite the fact that I was slowly sinking\
  \ myself. I looked at him with tears in my eyes and embraced him tightly. Prior\
  \ to this instance, I believed sinkholes were just some plot writers added to movies\
  \ to make them more intriguing. I never would have predicted that I could potentially\
  \ lose the man I loved to a sinkhole at The Dead Sea."
