Text: "PHINDA \u2013 WHERE BLINDING BEAUTY MEETS SHEER TERROR\n\n\u201CSouth Africa\
  \ isn\u2019t just beautiful, it is achingly beautiful\u201D \u2013 ex-US President\
  \ Bill Clinton\n\n&Beyond Phinda Private Game Reserve \u2026. a place where a once-in-a-lifetime\
  \ encounter with endangered species and the Big Five await those who imagine themselves\
  \ khaki-clad and bumping their way through the African bushveld under a canvas-topped\
  \ Land Cruiser.\n \nSituated amid the untamed plains of KwaZulu-Natal (between the\
  \ Mkuze Game Reserve and the Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park) this 170 km\xB2 private\
  \ game reserve is an easy three-hour drive from Durban \u2013 it offers discerning\
  \ guests, both local and international, a world-class luxury wild life experience\
  \ leaving them wanting for nothing, dreaming of more and scheming to return.\n\n\
  Each of its Rangers is highly skilled. They all have their own areas of expertise\
  \ and are able to offer guests immense local knowledge. Matt Yardley, a self-confessed\
  \ \u201Cfarm boy from Zululand\u201D is one such specialist and is a sought after\
  \ wildlife photographer.  His passion took root after capturing the rare and beautiful\
  \ moment when before his eyes, a rhino gently rested its head on a buffalo\u2019\
  s head. All at once he realised how many untold stories he could share through his\
  \ photography, especially when words are simply not enough to describe the scene.\
  \ \n\nFor Matt it is about \u201Ccapturing emotion, an entire story in a fraction\
  \ of a second. The African bush is the exact point where blinding beauty meets sheer\
  \ terror. It\u2019s that moment I search for\u201D, he says. \n\n\u201COne day we\
  \ were driving past a waterhole and all of a sudden, two massive elephant bulls\
  \ burst out from under the water like whales breaching! They had left only the very\
  \ tips of their trunks sticking out above the water in order to breathe. Needless\
  \ to say, laughter and gasps rang out through the vehicle as the bulls continued\
  \ to play and plunge\u201D, he recalls.\n\nMatt says that an awe-inspiring Phinda\
  \ photo experience does not always have to be about the birds and animals \u2013\
  \ it could also be the more subtle moments such as the spectacular African sunsets,\
  \ a storm over the plains or star gazing while lions roar in the distance.  As Nelson\
  \ Mandela famously said, \u201CI dream of our vast deserts, of our forests, of all\
  \ our great wildernesses\u201D.\n\nMatt offers hour long photography lessons which\
  \ alternate between camera and post production work. For Matt it is not only about\
  \ the exceptional guides, luxury accommodation and gourmet food, but also the startling\
  \ array of experiences on offer. He is as passionate about tracking and viewing\
  \ the Big Five, the black rhino and cheetah (both the latter are on the heavily\
  \ endangered list) as he is about photographing them.  \n\nHis day starts at 5am\
  \ with a pre-dawn Game Drive or Bush Walk and ends around 10pm after having dinner\
  \ with guests.  Somewhere in between he manages to fit in another four-hour Game\
  \ Drive, photography lessons, airstrip pickups, rifle assessments and ranger meetings.\
  \  No one day is ever the same.  Matt could relate to words of Oscar Wild when he\
  \ wrote \u2013 \u201CI never travel without my diary. One should always have something\
  \ sensational to read in the train\u201D. \n\n\u201CPhinda is really very special.\
  \ We have a phenomenal story to tell,\u201D he says. \u201CIn partnership with the\
  \ local community, hunting and farm lands have been changed into one of the most\
  \ successful conservation stories on the continent of Africa\u201D. \n\nIts proximity\
  \ to the Indian Ocean allows one to watch turtles lay eggs in the morning and to\
  \ stalk the Big Five later in the afternoon.  Some guests opt for a morning ocean\
  \ safari (to swim with dolphins and whale sharks before lunch) and still be on time\
  \ for the 4pm sundowner Game Drive before dinner. \n\nSome of the moments captured\
  \ by Matt\u2019s extraordinary photographic talent gives one a taste of just how\
  \ close he has sometimes come to a potentially life threatening situation.  However,\
  \ what frightens this strapping young Phinda ranger the most is the sight of an\
  \ inflated kiddies\u2019 party balloon!"
