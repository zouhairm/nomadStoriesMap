Text: "It\u2019s never a good time to find out that one has the sex appeal of a potato,\
  \ but this was certainly one of the worst moments. Stranded on the highway in Nicaragua\
  \ between Managua and Leon, I had finally hitched up my skirt to show some leg and\
  \ stuck my arm out with my thumb pointing in the direction of Leon. I felt ridiculous,\
  \ but these were desperate times and that move always worked in the movies. Twenty\
  \ vehicles passed me by without even slowing down. \n\nMarco and I were on our way\
  \ to Leon, Nicaragua to spend NYE 2015 and hike to the crater of the active volcano,\
  \ Telica, where we might get lucky and have the once-in-a-lifetime chance of looking\
  \ down at magma. The minivan that we were on had been rear-ended by another minivan\
  \ that our driver had been in an unofficial race with ever since we left Managua.\
  \ Nothing can jolt one out of jetlag after a long flight from the US quite like\
  \ careening down a highway driven by a Nicaraguan Michael Schumacher. Now both vans\
  \ were waiting for tow trucks to arrive, and we were left\u2014thankfully, unscathed\u2014\
  wondering how to get to Leon.\n\nIt had been an hour of waving at passing colorful\
  \ \u201Cchicken\u201D buses, minivans, and taxis, but they were all full and would\
  \ not stop.  We were standing on the side of the dusty highway under the prime conditions\
  \ of 35 degrees Celsius, what felt like 100% humidity, two heavy backpacks, and\
  \ a 1-liter bottle of water to share between the two of us with no tienda in sight.\
  \ When we had almost decided to walk the remaining 50 km to Leon, a car finally\
  \ slowed down beside us. The driver was a resident of Leon on his way home, and\
  \ offered to drop us at our hostel for a fee. Marco, always frugal, started bargaining\
  \ immediately, trying to lower the price by 100 cordobas ($3)\u2014although this\
  \ man was our only get-out-of-the-highway card. I was questioning our wedding vows,\
  \ but Marco reached a compromise with the man\u2014saving us a grand $1.50\u2014\
  and we got into his car and were finally on our way to Leon again. \n\nWe got chatting\
  \ with our rescuer, Miguel during the hour-long ride, and we were buenos amigos\
  \ by the time we reached Leon. He was a taxi driver and sometimes worked with one\
  \ of the local tour agencies as a guide, and gave us valuable suggestions for our\
  \ stay in Leon. He drove us to the address we had provided for the hostel that we\
  \ had booked online three months before. Hungry, jetlagged, and bedraggled, we were\
  \ looking forward to dumping our luggage in the room and going to gorge on the local\
  \ cuisine.  There was no sign outside the hostel, and when we asked about our reservation\
  \ to the lady standing near the entrance, we were told that the hostel had closed\
  \ for good a month ago. After being in a car accident, then stranded on the highway,\
  \ and now, finding out our hostel no longer existed\u2014all in the span of 3 hours\
  \ after landing in Nicaragua\u2014our reaction after the first surprised silence\
  \ was exhausted laughter. \n\nMiguel came to the rescue again and suggested that\
  \ we go home with him for lunch and he would then take us to some of the more popular\
  \ hostels so that we could find a room.  Too tired to think of alternatives, we\
  \ joined him and his charming family\u2014his wife managed admirably to hide her\
  \ surprise at seeing us\u2014for a flavorful meal of gallo pinto, fried plantains,\
  \ and vegetables, and played hopscotch with his two kids after lunch. Later, after\
  \ thanking them profusely, and engaging Miguel to take us to the Telica volcano\
  \ the next day, we went with him to find accommodation.\n\nSitting beside Miguel\
  \ and his wife on the charpoy outside their home that afternoon, drinking agua de\
  \ jamaica and sharing stories in my broken Spanish with these accidental friends,\
  \ I mused on how we travelers can always rely on the kindness of locals, and, wherever\
  \ we are, how one\u2019s empathy for someone in trouble binds us all together."
