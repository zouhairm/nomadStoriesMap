Text: "Why I call Norway as my personal Narnia? It\u2019s not only because of its\
  \ fabulous nature; although, this is what I like in Norway the most. Of course,\
  \ in Russia, where I originally come from, we also have wonderful forests and impressive\
  \ landscapes, but in Norway the nature is somehow closer to you (and you\u2019re\
  \ closer to it). I like this feeling of freedom \u2013 silence, wind in the hair,\
  \ and nobody is nearby \u2013 such a paradise for introverts! But return to reasons\
  \ why I compare Norway with Narnia. First, it\u2019s because of time: it seems that\
  \ time passes differently here. I feel that it runs slower, especially in comparison\
  \ with a crazy Moscow speed. In addition, because of the Midnight Sun you have much\
  \ more time in summer and walking on the streets at 00:00 and later sounds not too\
  \ unrealistic. Second reason is due to feeling yourself as a more physically stronger\
  \ person. Do you remember how Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy could easily swim, fight\
  \ and ride horses in Narnia? So did I in Norway, even though I am not a super-athletic\
  \ person; but it\u2019s like being a better version of yourself \u2013 more brave,\
  \ strong and stamina...\n\nPast and present\nTrondheim is known as the medieval\
  \ capital of the Norwegian Kingdom. The name \u201CTrondheim\u201D was chosen by\
  \ its citizens during the referendum in 1928, when the majority preferred it against\
  \ the ancient name of Nidaros. Nowadays the city is the top location for students\
  \ and researchers (imagine that one out of six inhabitants here is a student). The\
  \ city has a good infrastructure, so you can easily reach it by plain from Oslo,\
  \ Krakow, London, Barcelona or even NY. Another alternative is a train from Oslo:\
  \ people say the view outside the window is breathtaking.\n\nTrondheim is the most\
  \ northern city with a tram system in the world!\nAfter closing a tram system in\
  \ Arkhangelsk, Trondheim becomes the most northern city in the world with a tram\
  \ line, called Gr\xE5kallbanen. Therefore, you should definitely take this chance,\
  \ if one day you come to visit Trondheim, especially if it happens in a rainy day.\
  \ \nThere is only one tram line, running from St. Olav\u2019s Gate in the city center\
  \ uphill to the recreational area of Bymarka. On the tram\u2019s way, you will get\
  \ a nice view of the city. Furthermore, at the end station (Lian) there is a restaurant\
  \ with a view above the lake.\n\nCozy cafes and restaurants to feel \u2018hygge\u2019\
  \nI guess, everybody heard a word \u2018hygge\u2019. It was chosen to be 2016 Oxford\
  \ Dictionary Word of the Year. Although it is a Danish word meaning \u2018coziness\u2019\
  , I have a feeling that it can be applied for the whole Scandinavia and its lifestyle.\
  \ It\u2019s quite hard to describe this word properly, and I believe that everyone\
  \ has his/her own \u2018hygge\u2019. In general, it\u2019s a word describing something\
  \ ordinary that makes you happier. You can feel \u2018hygge\u2019, when you come\
  \ home after a long working day, take off your shoes and make a big cup of cacao.\
  \ It\u2019s also \u2018hygge\u2019, when you\u2019re in the bosom of your family\
  \ celebrating your small victories and achievements.\nI always tried to catch a\
  \ \u2018hygge\u2019 at Norwegian cafes and restaurants. Many of them are characterized\
  \ by some unique features, even though they may have quite same meals. For instance,\
  \ I really liked the atmosphere of the caf\xE9 which looked like the house of your\
  \ Granny with old-fashioned furniture, retro pictures on the walls and very tasty\
  \ sweets. I used to make some informal connections with local people while being\
  \ in cafes.\n\nAdditional tips\nYou won\u2019t find the most famous sights like\
  \ Trolltunga or Kjerag in Trondheim, but I guarantee you will discover your own\
  \ fairytale world there. Depending on season, there are a lot of things and actions\
  \ you can visit or explore during your trip to Trondheim, e.g. the Nidaros Cathedral,\
  \ the fjord, the confectionery factory Nidar, a nearby village R\xF8ros, or the\
  \ Northern Lights. However, I would recommend checking other opportunities that\
  \ city may offer to you, in addition to its touristic component. Remember that Trondheim\
  \ is a homeland of different music festivals or art exhibitions (e.g. JazzFest).\
  \ Enjoy!"
