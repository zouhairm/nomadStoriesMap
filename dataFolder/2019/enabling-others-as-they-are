Text: "Silver glitter dripped off as I glanced down to check the Metro stop for tonight\u2019\
  s discoteca. I absentmindedly ran my hand through my hair, wondering if I would\
  \ kiss any cute Spaniards that evening. A twinkling arc cascaded behind me. There\
  \ was certainly glitter on my butt, and my lopsided fuchsia lipstick was starting\
  \ to crack. As stares progressively increased around me, I knew I was committing\
  \ many subtle social transgressions. \n\nI could not be more proud. \n\nThis is\
  \ not a story about how my 11-year-old host brother\u2019s makeup skills affected\
  \ my adventures in Madrid. This is not even a story about how familial love transcends\
  \ romance.\n\nThis is a story about opening myself to enable others to be as they\
  \ are. \n\nWhen I reflect on the glee that poured from my host brother Diego that\
  \ night \u2014 of washing my hair in his mom\u2019s sink so that the glitter could\
  \ attach to my drenched strands, of painting my lips fuchsia even though it clashed\
  \ with my outfit, of every time I affirmed \u201Cyes\u201D before he executed a\
  \ design decision \u2014 he was free. Gender roles went flying out of the tiny window\
  \ overlooking Chamberi. He tested blush on his cheeks and curled his lashes and\
  \ danced when he perfectly blended eyeshadow. \n\nI was in no way a hero to Diego.\
  \ But, I made it clear that I loved him openly and wholeheartedly. With me, he was\
  \ safe; I would not judge him. He could try, fail, and be as fully as he wanted.\
  \ Even though I walked out the door most of those nights looking ridiculous, whether\
  \ glitter erupted in a trail behind me or foundation caked my face, I was thrilled\
  \ because that makeup symbolized something magical. That makeup was a tangible reminder\
  \ that for those 45 minutes we were getting ready, Diego had the chance to unleash\
  \ his whole self. \n\nWe live in a gorgeous world full of life, depth, and love.\
  \ We also live in a world full of performance. I expect almost all of us have needed\
  \ to put on a mask at various points in our lives. We perform every time we inaccurately\
  \ respond to \u201CHow are you?\u201D with \u201CWell,\u201D or go along with a\
  \ group mentality even when we think differently. To be oneself in societies that\
  \ tug us to fit into molds demands tremendous courage. For many people, however,\
  \ pretending is the only safe option. It became abundantly clear over the course\
  \ of my stay that Diego\u2019s classmates did not appreciate his stunning creativity.\
  \ They bullied him because he was different. They bullied him because of toxic masculinity,\
  \ entitlement, and fear. Diego\u2019s family fortunately supported him; however,\
  \ like all parents, they did not want their child to be hurt. \n\nI share this story\
  \ because I believe travel writing can also be a form of advocacy. If I can contribute\
  \ to making this world even a bit safer for Diego, who should have the liberty to\
  \ fearlessly be his whole self in public, then I will continue to blend travel narratives\
  \ with commentary that upholds the dignity and liberty of all my fellow humans.\
  \ \n\nWhen we open ourselves to failure and rejection in service of compassionate\
  \ acceptance, we can allow others the opportunity to finally be as they are. We\
  \ all mess up; we all end up with glitter on our butts and piercing stares from\
  \ strangers. Summoning the courage to be in these moments, hold my head high, and\
  \ feel immeasurably proud of what this \u201Cpain\u201D meant filled my heart with\
  \ purpose. My minor inconveniences meant nothing compared to the joy that flowed\
  \ from Diego when he did my makeup. The warmth that glows in our chests when we\
  \ do something meaningful, expansively twinkling because we know we are living a\
  \ value that is true, is what I want to feel every day of my life. I want to strive\
  \ for a global society where everyone can be as they are, and loved wholeheartedly\
  \ for it. If whenever sparkles rain out of my hair, they also fill my heart, I will\
  \ be the most joyful big sister in the world."
