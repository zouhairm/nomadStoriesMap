Text: "I didn't know that this place would resonate with me so much. I'll start with\
  \ the end. I was crying all the way home from Glasgow for a reason that I won't\
  \ tell you now. I looked out of the plane window and saw some of Scotland and a\
  \ lot of England laid out like a map. I saw the Forth Bridge and both of the Severn\
  \ Bridges. I came home thinking that I Ihad learned more from Glasgow than anywhere\
  \ else in my life. I was 39, about the age of a mid life crisis. I travelled with\
  \ my mother. We hadn't spent much time alone together, having always been with sister\
  \ and dad. We worked out that when we were together we had a very easy time. We\
  \ were both annoying, my mum brought a plastic ziplock bag of Shortbread to Scotland\
  \ and didn't believe in Google Maps. I went out dancing to Indie music when she\
  \ thought I would stay home. We loved the Scottish Colourists and Mackintosh's school,\
  \ (where we set off an alarm looking for a special brick that he hid). We ate vegetables\
  \ because that's what we like and we went home when we felt like it.\n\nWe had fish\
  \ and chips in the Horsehoe Bar where we chatted with lovely Glaswegian men. It\
  \ was a shame to say that all we heard and understood was gcgvdsvuhv Hen dadgasgfsgfj\
  \ Hen sdhvksdjhfkjsdhf Hen. I asked somebody, does Hen mean Chicken or Love or something\
  \ else? I think it\u2019s a word on it\u2019s own which makes you feel comfortable\
  \ and looked after. \n\nIn the whiskey Bar, we realised that Laphroig is the drink\
  \ of the gods, especially when matured in a sherry Barrel. Yet again we were amongst\
  \ friends. We went for a curry as we had been told Glaswegian curry was the best.\
  \ We agreed with that, it was amazing. The Museum of Contemporary Art was having\
  \ an open day, probably for children. No matter, we sat on the floor and made cardboard\
  \ houses, masks and badges. The building was old and the art was new. It worked\
  \ perfectly. We saw the burnt out Glasgow School of Art, which was very sad. That\
  \ such a renowned artist had designed it (mainly out of wood) was hard to get your\
  \ head round. Later we heard that many of Mackintosh\u2019s design features were\
  \ in storage elsewhere so hopefully would be restored.\n\nWe sneaked in to the Mackingtosh\
  \ Caf\xE9, but it seemed too formal for a cup of tea so we left after admiring the\
  \ windows. The buildings were grand and the streets interesting. The underground\
  \ was old fashioned and orange, we went the wrong way but were helped to get back.\
  \ I watched some football on the telly. It was Celtic (I have looking at Rangers)\
  \ against Livington. The game was good and the mood matey. It took me a couple of\
  \ hours to work out which team I was cheering for.\n\nI met somebody who I will\
  \ remember for the rest of my life, because of the music and the gentle accent.\
  \ For the first time ever I went out dancing on my own and had a lot of fun, despite\
  \ the pouring rain. Glasgow struck me as a place full of art, both historical and\
  \ contemporary and full of people who cared about where they came from.\n\nWe saw\
  \ the \u2018People Make Glasgow\u2019 slogan everywhere and we completely understood\
  \ it. I saw a bike for hire with \u2018Puddles Make Glasgow\u2019, which was seemed\
  \ to fit too. Never have I left a place where every single person I met I could\
  \ be friends with. I have a \u2018People Make Glasgow\u2019 magnet on my fridge\
  \ and I will never forget it.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the weather I would be up\
  \ there right now."
