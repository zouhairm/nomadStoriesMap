Text: "It started with a book; it ended with a miracle. Unexpected connections don\u2019\
  t require traveling to an exotic locale - they only require being aware and open\
  \ to those around you.\n\nThe book was \"The Glass Kitchen\" by Linda Francis Lee,\
  \ a story about a woman who navigates her world through her passion for cooking.\
  \ A little magic, a little emotion, and a lot of love drew me into this mouthwatering\
  \ story. \n\nI was listening to the audiobook version on a road trip from Ohio to\
  \ Georgia. The drive between those states is a long one, and requires going through\
  \ some of the less populated parts of Tennessee. My stomach started actually growling,\
  \ and I knew it was time for a pitstop. \n\nRight off the exit was a gas station\
  \ with four pumps and a Sonic \u2013 not a bad fast food chain, but I just couldn\u2019\
  t imagine wolfing through a half-cooked burger while listening to Lee\u2019s descriptions\
  \ of these beautiful meals. However, the ticking clock reminded me that I couldn\u2019\
  t casually drive through this tiny town hoping for a restaurant that tantalized\
  \ my taste buds.\n\nWhenever I\u2019m in a dilemma, even one as slightly ridiculous\
  \ as this, I consult the Lord \u2013 He\u2019s always got the big picture and the\
  \ willingness to listen. So, I asked, \u201Cdo I suck it up and go to Sonic? Or\
  \ is there a place worth going to?\u201D As I stood there pumping gas, a small wooden\
  \ sign caught my eye. It was in front of a roadside caf\xE9 about a block down from\
  \ me.\n\nUpon entering, I realized that the diner\u2019s garish yellow color scheme\
  \ and ripped pleather seats guaranteed it would never make a Tennessee guidebook.\
  \ However, the appetizing smells that hit me cemented that I was in the right place.\
  \ \n\nThe mousy waitress who took my order politely asked about my destination.\
  \ When I told her I was on my way to a Christian conference about the power of healing,\
  \ she looked straight at me and said, \u201CWell, I believe in healing. You\u2019\
  re looking at a medical miracle.\u201D\n\nThis unassuming woman in her 40's told\
  \ me a story of being born with half of a heart. Literally. From infancy to four\
  \ years old, she was in and out of hospitals. At the age of four, there was a final,\
  \ last-ditch surgery effort. Before the surgery, her family asked a local pastor\
  \ to come in. He and her mom placed their hands on her little arms and prayed. She\
  \ came through the surgery and began to be able to function normally.\n\nOriginally,\
  \ the doctors predicted she wouldn\u2019t live past her teens. She said she and\
  \ God defied that. Then, they said that she wouldn\u2019t have kids. She proudly\
  \ showed me pictures of her two sons. \n\nMeeting her and hearing her tale was the\
  \ highlight of my whole trip (although the conference itself was powerful and inspiring!).\
  \ In a town that barely made a blip on a map, a woman I never met before and likely\
  \ will never see again, impacted me in a way that still remains. Not only was she\
  \ a walking example that miracles still happen, she reminded me that everyone has\
  \ a story. You just have to open your ears and pay attention.\n\nOh, and the daily\
  \ special that she recommended went perfectly with \"The Glass Kitchen.\" I finished\
  \ out the rest of the book, listening to the main character Portia delving into\
  \ her new culinary surroundings, while chomping on flavorful meat loaf. The homemade\
  \ slices dripped their juice simultaneously on my chin and between the grilled layers\
  \ of thick Texas toast. \n\nWhile munching, I remembered what author Patti Digh\
  \ said about a friend of hers who was rendered speechless by a whale-watching expedition.\
  \ She wrote, \u201CWhy, David asked afterward, do we reserve such awe for whales\
  \ and not for human beings? Why don\u2019t we look to other humans (and ourselves)\
  \ with the same eye? That man from Cincinnati beside you on the plane in seat 8B?\
  \ He\u2019s miraculous \u2013 see it, acknowledge it.\u201D\n\nAcknowledged, Patti.\
  \ Acknowledged."
