Text: "Me and my husband split up after 10 years of marriage while travelling in Canada,\
  \ last summer. We planned this trip for ages and unfortunately it ended like the\
  \ worst trip ever. First thought I had was: \"I'm still in love with him, how will\
  \ I cope with that? how will I be able to travel again?\". \nThen I've spent so\
  \ many days crying, without eating and sleeping properly and enjoying life. \nSoon\
  \ I realized I didn't want to spend the first Christmas alone with my own family\
  \ or New Year's Eve with all of our shared married friends like the \"separated\
  \ girl\". So, without thinking twice, I booked a 2 weeks trip. My first solo trip.\
  \ Scaring and thrilling enough!\nQuoting the Oasis: \"Out to sea, it's the only\
  \ place I honestly, can't get myself some piece of mind\": so, because I was running\
  \ out of money I thought about a cheap place by the sea with warmer weather than\
  \ Milan and in Europe. \nI was never been in Lisbon, my husband visited once and\
  \ he told me he considered it a nasty city and, because with him I didn't had the\
  \ chance to go there, I took all the bravery I had and I chose Lisbon as my destination,\
  \ and I booked the flight and the hostel. I want to travel easy and with a minimalist\
  \ mood, stay with cosmopolitan people, feel the vibes of freedom and enjoy the seaside.\
  \ I didn't plan anything special except for my first surf lesson ever, on the first\
  \ day of my arrival, Christmas Eve, crazy enough! \nIt was one of the best experience\
  \ in my life: the water was warm enough, hitting the waves was like I needed to\
  \ face all the bad things happened in my life and that I needed a fresh new start,\
  \ I needed to wake up! I met a Canadian girl at this surf lessons - another sign,\
  \ she's from Toronto, when my heart was broken - we talked a lot, she was finding\
  \ relief after a break up too.  I get lost in Lisbon the following days. No plans,\
  \ just wandering, walking, thinking and crying alone. Enjoying my free time, talking\
  \ to people from all over the World and meeting new friends. \nLisbon is a real\
  \ cosmopolitan city, everybody is friendly and everybody talk to you in English.\
  \ \nI visited the Berardo Museum and Belem. I ate Pastel the Nata, bacalao \xE0\
  \ bras and tinned fish. I went to the hipster Lx market for a vegan brunch. I felt\
  \ accepted from this city, like I was a local, and in Alfama I've felt more connected\
  \ to my family (we are from Sardinha) and, obviously, with my inner spirit.\nThen\
  \ I spent a night in Barrio Alto with my new Canadian girlfriend, listening to live\
  \ fado music, a cure for our broken hearts. We tried porto wine and ginginha and\
  \ while walking I met an amazing guy. We kissed after few minutes we met, in Miradouro\
  \ de Sao Pedro, and I felt like I was a survivor, like a plant able to blossom again.\
  \ Even for just one moment.\nThen I went to Cascais and the faboulous Sintra and\
  \ back to Lisbon when I've spent New Years Eve alone in Placa do Commercio. Under\
  \ the fireworks I received the first message of the New Year, it was the guy I met,\
  \ he wanted to meet me again and say goodbye. But no taxi were available, and I\
  \ was so sad, because I felt the connection with him, and I didn't want to miss\
  \ the chance. While I was trying to find the way catcha a ride, I met a really kind\
  \ Portuguese guy who made it possible. We shared a Uber drive and, like in a romantic\
  \ comedy, he helped me chasing him. I've promise in change for the help I received,\
  \ because of the Karma law, I will help a Portuguese guy in Italy and for sure I\
  \ will as soon as I have the opportunity. \nFor now thank you Lisbon: you are beautiful,\
  \ you made me cry, you made me eat again, you made me love again."
