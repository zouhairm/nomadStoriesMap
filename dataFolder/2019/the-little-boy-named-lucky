Text: "I took my first business flight at the age of 23. I was not a seasoned traveller\
  \ at the time. I flew from Johannesburg to Durban. I had a rental car, and spent\
  \ two days in Durban working on a project. On my last day I drove by a lady standing\
  \ in the street with a very small baby in her arms. I could see desperation I her\
  \ eyes. I stopped my car. Asked how I can help. She said that the driveway led to\
  \ an orphanage & that the baby she was holding was terribly ill. I did not expect\
  \ to find such a gravely ill child by the roadside. She explained that they did\
  \ not have money for gasoline to get the baby to hospital. Without thinking twice\
  \ I offered to take her to hospital.  It was still morning and my flight was in\
  \ the afternoon. The baby was limp in her arms, his eyes rolling... She directed\
  \ me to the public government hospital. We joined the queue. I could not just leave\
  \ them there. How would they get back? We stood for four hours. The lady fainted\
  \ and I grabbed the baby from her hands just in time. Now I had two patients on\
  \ my hands. Some staff came to see to the lady and took her away. Finally it was\
  \ time for the doctors to see the baby. \"What's his name?\" they asked. I said\
  \ \"I don't know\". \"How old is he?\" they asked \"I don't know\" I responded and\
  \ explained how I got to to be there. They took off all his clothes and dressed\
  \ him in a hospital gown. \"Please sign here\" said the nurse. I  said \"I am not\
  \ the guardian of this child\". She said \"either you sign him in or he does not\
  \ get signed in.\" I signed the baby in. Relation: none. I went to his cot to go\
  \ say goodbye. The nurse said to me if I had brought him later he probably would\
  \ have died. I went back to the hospital entrance in the hope to find the lady.\
  \ She was there. Wirhout her knowing she was pregnant. That's why she fainted. I\
  \ took her back to the orphanage. As I sped off to the airport I realised that time\
  \ was running out. Once I got to the airport I ran to the Departures hall as fast\
  \ as I could. The counter to my airline was closed. The ground hostess said that\
  \ the gates close 30 minutes prior to the flight. It was 29 minutes to. I pleaded\
  \ \"please let me on to this flight\" but with no avail. The gates were closed.\
  \ I did not have money for a plane ticket back home. I did not even own a credit\
  \ card! I collapsed into a little heap, crying. I cried myself into a nose-bleed,\
  \ and draped myself over my suitcases. ..just lying there. Crying. In an empty hall.\
  \ \n\nParamedics rushed toward me. They took me to a medical room. Between the tears\
  \ I said \"my suitcase.... my suitcase!\".... \"don't worry\" said one of the paramedics.\
  \  The man you are travelling with has it. I was not travelling with a man! The\
  \ medics were all over me: stopping the bleed cleaning my face, taking my pulse\
  \ and blood pressure.  Once \"stabilised\" an old man came to the medical room.\
  \ \"Hi. My name is John. Sorry about what happened to you. I handed your suitcase\
  \ in for the next flight to Johannesburg. I am also on that flight. So you will\
  \ not be flying alone\". He gave up his seat in business class for me and sat at\
  \ the back of the aircraft for the remainder of the flight. At arrivals I introduced\
  \ John to my parents. I looked him in the eye and said \"thank you\" and he said:\
  \ \"no, thank you\". In a flash he was gone. \n\nI never saw nor heard of John again,\
  \ but I will never, never forget him. And as for the baby? No one knows what happened\
  \ to him, but I still think of him often: the little boy I decided to call Lucky."
