Text: "Madeira island apeared magnificent over the atlantic sea in the morning of\
  \ a beautiful day of May. The travel in the Costa cruise has been perfect so far\
  \ now traveling from italy to Madeira in a long trip.   The visit started in the\
  \ botanical Park of Madeira, that it is son gorgeus, with a lot of diferent species\
  \ like cactus or papiro but beside the looking of the vegetation you always can\
  \ see the town from the highs and the sea. In the middle of the Park exist a small\
  \  caf\xE9 with tipical sweet foods like the orange cake or the banana cake but\
  \ the speciall ofert there is that you  can taste a kind of sweet wine very tipical\
  \ of the island. After to visit the Park you can get down to the center of the town\
  \ taking a telespheric transport that will gives you a speciall view from the place\
  \ and building. In the center of Funchal you must visit the public market, where\
  \ they sale exotical fruits with very strange names and aperiences!... the same\
  \ happens when you see the part of the seafood...where if you are lucky  you will\
  \ see a morena with their horrible teeths!!!  Near to the market exist a lot of\
  \ tipical restaurants that invite you to know the Madeira's food... But for a problem\
  \ of time in my case o did not eat this food, thing that i regret a lot, so you\
  \ must plane your trip there thinking in enjoy at least 1 hour of the great Madeira's\
  \ food! Continued in the center of Funchal, exist a lot of souvenirs shops where\
  \ they sale the most beautiful handcrafts of Madeira and the special hats decorated\
  \ with small figures of people and other things... they are all beautiful and it\
  \ depends how do you use the tail placed in the top of the hat, you can say to others\
  \ many information about yourself like if you are a women single or married or a\
  \ man single or married too, so this cute hat tells the others important personal\
  \ information related with your love life!!! My travel was so short but i really\
  \ want to return to Madeira to know everything that i missed, i hope that you will\
  \ get a better picture of the island than mine, but in this few words that you just\
  \ red o encourage you to visit Madeira some day..."
