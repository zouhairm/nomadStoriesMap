Text: "No matter how organised you think you are, nothing can prepare you for your\
  \ first trip abroad without your parents. At the age of seventeen, and in my first\
  \ year of university, I decided to save every last penny that student life could\
  \ spare and embark on my first true adventure: South East Asia. I had written extensive\
  \ lists, Googled all the tourist spots and packed my suitcase two months early;\
  \ \u201CWhat could possibly go wrong?\u201D I asked myself, as I awoke at 5am to\
  \ the Scottish sunrise piercing through the gap above my tiny, single-glazed, student\
  \ flat window. I am not usually a morning person, but, after spending the entirety\
  \ of my high school years dreaming of travel and exploration, I had never felt so\
  \ elated to be awake before the local seagulls.\nTo my delight, I was not alone\
  \ on my travels; I had met someone with just as much enthusiasm for adventure as\
  \ myself, although not quite so enthusiastic about waking up at 5am, after I confessed\
  \ that we would have to spend four hours in the airport. What can I say? I wanted\
  \ everything to run smoothly. And smoothly it did. In fact, so smoothly that we\
  \ were upgraded to a penthouse suite in our hotel in Bangkok. This smoothness wore\
  \ off rather quickly.\nWe had planned a wonderful route: after arriving in Bangkok\
  \ and staying for two nights to cure our jet lag, we decided to catch a flight to\
  \ Cambodia for the beginning of an extraordinary month in one of the most beautiful\
  \ parts of the world exploring Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Singapore. \nCambodia\
  \ was a country that neither me, nor my partner, had ever considered when discussing\
  \ our travels but a friend informed us that we should go whilst we are there and\
  \ see Angkor Wat \u2013 one of the seven wonders of the world! What an amazing experience\
  \ to tick off our bucket list, sign me up! This meant that we had no idea what to\
  \ expect, making the journey that bit more exciting.\nSo off we went, departing\
  \ from our wonderful life of luxury in Bangkok in a 1997 Ford Mondeo with no front\
  \ bumper and only one functional headlight. The journey to the airport was long,\
  \ but the adrenaline pumping through our bodies was enough to keep us entertained\
  \ and when we arrived, we were ready to leap into the unknown. Standing in the queue,\
  \ clutching on to my passport, visa, driver\u2019s license (anything that I might\
  \ possibly have to present), I turned to my partner and asked: \u201CWhere\u2019\
  s your passport? We\u2019re next!\u201D \nI watched his face as he rummaged through\
  \ his gigantic, 75 litre rucksack: at first he appeared tranquil until little sparks\
  \ of panic began to creep into his expression. \n\u201CI can\u2019t find it. Laura,\
  \ I can\u2019t find it!\u201D\nI was surprisingly calm, convinced that he had thrown\
  \ it in the bottom of the bag with his clothes or some other rational explanation.\
  \ But, after 10 minutes of searching and the contents of not just his, but also\
  \ my own gigantic, 75 litre rucksack \u2013 I really cannot express how gigantic\
  \ these bags were \u2013 scattered across the terminal floor, I began to realise\
  \ that the passport was not going materialise out of thin air. A frenzy of phonecalls\
  \ back and forth to our hotel followed and eventually we managed to persuade the\
  \ staff to have the passport sent to the airport\u2026 in a limousine. With 40 minutes\
  \ to spare before the gates closed, we prayed for some miracle that the now rush\
  \ hour traffic would clear and the passport would arrive in time to catch our flight.\
  \ \nLow and behold, a short, middle-aged man came running down the terminal walkway\
  \ an hour later, clutching the passport and waving it about frantically. By this\
  \ point, I had managed to waddle my way to the check in desk with both rucksacks,\
  \ leaving my partner to meet the man.\nNow, twenty minutes late with two passports,\
  \ two checked-in bags and two flustered brains, we pleaded with the check-in assistant\
  \ to let us through. Her reply?\n\u201COf course; I don\u2019t know why you are\
  \ rushing, your flight has been delayed by two hours.\u201D"
