Text: "Have you ever heard the story about the starfish? It goes like this: a little\
  \ boy is walking fast along an ocean shore, rushing to throw starfish after starfish\
  \ back in the water after hundreds have been left on hot sand by the retreating\
  \ tide. A man approaches and tells the little boy that he can not change the world\
  \ with such small acts. The little boy throws a starfish back in the water and replies\
  \ with something like, \"I changed the world of that one.\" The moral of the story\
  \ is, we can all change the world in a small way no matter who we are. \n\nIn 2013,\
  \ someone changed my world while I was on my high school\u2019s humanitarian aid\
  \ trip to the Dominican Republic. My classmates and I spent a week living in Yamasa,\
  \ a town made vibrant by red, orange, and ocean blue huts, as well as by the people.\
  \ Every Dominican we passed while bringing food and medicinal supplies to local\
  \ families smiled and waved at us. The families we brought supplies to hugged us\
  \ as hard as a mother would if her child returned home after months of being away.\
  \ I felt love and kindness all around me, but the culmination of these feelings\
  \ came when we visited the Batays.\n\nThe Batays are considered the poorest part\
  \ of Yamasa, where individuals and families cannot access or afford clean drinking\
  \ water or healthcare. A local man named Anthony took us on a walk through the Batays\
  \ and told us the story of a man named Polito. Polito once had a wife and many children,\
  \ but they passed away due to health problems that he had no money to fix. When\
  \ he got old and sick, his house collapsed in a storm. The community banded together\
  \ to build him a barn-like structure to keep him in the shade and at peace in his\
  \ final few years of life.\n\nAs Anthony finished the story, we arrived at the barn-like\
  \ structure and looked inside through an open doorway. There, in the middle of a\
  \ concrete floor, a man laid covered by blankets, his skeleton-like feet sticking\
  \ out the end. Flies were buzzing around him, but his breathing was heavy, causing\
  \ the overlying turquoise and pink striped comforter to rise and fall. This was\
  \ Polito. \n\nJust as I thought, \u201CThis man must be an angel to have his community\
  \ care for him,\u201D Polito raised his frail hand above the mound of blankets and\
  \ waved at us. My classmates and I fell silent. Most of us began to tear up. Polito\
  \ seemed too weak to swat flies away when we arrived, but he found the strength\
  \ to wave at us! We read the story about the starfish for a journal prompt the day\
  \ before, and we felt that Polito was our starfish. He died only two days after\
  \ our visit and it felt like our purpose seeing him was to give him one last dose\
  \ of care and joy. We were like the little boy putting a starfish back in the water.\
  \ \n\nBut now that I think about it, I was a starfish too. At that point I was seventeen,\
  \ getting ready to choose a university and worrying about who I was going to be.\
  \ When Polito waved, a feeling of warmth washed over me. He showed me that no matter\
  \ what hardships or losses we face, we can be resilient with acts of kindness. Since\
  \ then, I\u2019ve made it a goal to make the world a better place by writing songs\
  \ about things I\u2019ve been through in hopes that someone else can find solace\
  \ in them. My journey to Yamasa not only humbled me and made me a stronger person,\
  \ but gave me an unforgettable role model. Polito is a kind soul I will never stop\
  \ remembering."
