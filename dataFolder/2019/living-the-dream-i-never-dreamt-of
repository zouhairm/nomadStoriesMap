Text: "When we opened our google map, we could locate ourselves just few miles away\
  \ from the Line of Control. Considering the tension between our neighbours, it added\
  \ that extra bit of adventure in our trip to Leh from Srinagar via Kargil. Spending\
  \ a night at Kargil was always a part of the plan and after experiencing the stunning\
  \ landscapes that brought us here in Kargil, we knew our trip started with a bang.\
  \ While a visit to the Kargil War Memorial gave us Goosebumps, our hotel at the\
  \ vicinity of the ever flowing Sindhu river made our soul leap with joy.\n\nAfter\
  \ our breakfast, we started our journey towards Leh. We were promised an even better\
  \ view of the landscapes today and it was a promise well-kept indeed. The road trip\
  \ from Srinagar to Leh is considered one of the best in the world. For me, frankly,\
  \ I did not care comparing. The 5 hours journey is still fresh in my memory. \n\n\
  Stay at Leh is like staying at any other hill station. The perfect weather made\
  \ us stare at the gigantic Himalayas every now and then. I don\u2019t want to get\
  \ into details of the city sight scene as it has nothing special to overdo our road\
  \ trip yet.\n\nOur ride to Nubra Valley via Khardung La (self-proclaimed to be the\
  \ highest motor able road in the world) was bumpy and tiring but the raw beauty\
  \ of the Karakoram made up for it. It is because of Nubra that Ladakh is termed\
  \ as \u2018The desert in the skies\u2019. The night went well after another round\
  \ of bumpy Double-hump camel ride.\nThe trip started with high note in the name\
  \ of a roadtrip, but the graph has been steady since. Who knew then that the actual\
  \ surprise was being cooked for the penultimate day of our trip.\n\nIt was the 14th\
  \  of August 2017 and the 5th day of our journey to the Heaven on Mother Earth.\
  \ The JOSH was certainly high, not physically though as we have already travelled\
  \ over 1000 kms by road in three and a half days. We intended to reach Pangong Tso\
  \ Lake before sunset but it was just in time. Cameras were out but it was the dying\
  \ minutes of sunlight and we were a bit disappointed not to get a better view. We\
  \ were supposed to stay in a tent just 200 metres from the lake. Dinner was served\
  \ quickly but we were still bewailing about not getting the \u2018Sunset at Pangong\
  \ Tso\u2019 checklist ticked off smoothly. As night progressed, the monumental cosmic\
  \ structure above left us awestruck. We were debating whether we are witnessing\
  \ the Milky Way above us and concluded with the point that whatever we are viewing,\
  \ it\u2019s mind-blowing. So we decided to live in that moment. \n\nIts 00:30 now\
  \ and getting colder. The lake is quiet and the mountains surrounding it are slowly\
  \ getting covered with snow. People have got bored of the Milky Way perhaps as there\
  \ were only our bunch outside at that point of time. I was struggling with my tripod,\
  \ still trying to get a perfect shot of the Milky Way when one of us pointed to\
  \ a direction behind one of those snow-capped mountains. At first it seemed like\
  \ a tube light pointing towards the sky. China was 30 kms away and we joked may\
  \ be they are attacking us. Yeah, PJs like this kept us moving against all odds.\
  \ Now comes the part which ticked all possible checkboxes. For the next 5minutes\
  \ we witnessed something which was out of this freaking world. The tube light shaped\
  \ object started growing in size and radius with every passing second until it formed\
  \ into more than a half grown moon. We were left speechless at the outcome and when\
  \ the moonlight filled the entire area with its silver colour, it looked like a\
  \ completely different place. When we looked at each other we knew our trip was\
  \ successful there. We wished each other Happy Independence Day and went to sleep\
  \ with total contentment."
