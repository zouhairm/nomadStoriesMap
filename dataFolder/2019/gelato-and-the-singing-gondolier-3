Text: "As I looked out the window of my flight to Europe, I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ feel a deep sense of excited anticipation. Somehow Peter, my best friend, convinced\
  \ me to take an unexpected trip to Italy for a few weeks, and since I have a tendency\
  \ to over plan, I hadn\u2019t expected my first trip out of the states to be so\
  \ haphazardly strewn together. When we finally landed in Venice, we were met by\
  \ a young woman calling out for Peter and he ran to greet her, Marcella, a foreign\
  \ student from some of our university classes during our last year. It finally became\
  \ apparent to me why Peter had chosen to visit Italy; it was her native country\
  \ and I was officially the third wheel on this bicycle built for two.\n\nWe decided\
  \ to avoid the touristy parts of the city for our first day, so we took a bus to\
  \ Dorsoduro, one of the six districts of Venice, to enjoy a stroll around Campo\
  \ Santa Margherita. The sun had begun to dip behind the old facades of the square\
  \ as lights from within make-shift taverns began to illuminate the streets and canals.\
  \ The hustle and bustle of university students brought laughter, music, and excitement\
  \ to us as Peter and Marcella stopped at a bar while I continued on my way to find\
  \ a quiet place to relax. After an hour of wandering through narrow corridors, I\
  \ stumbled upon a gelato shop that was still open. As I glanced inside to see the\
  \ flavors, my eyes fell upon the sight of a young Italian man sitting at a table\
  \ reading a book and paying no attention to his spoon, dipping it into his cup of\
  \ gelato and placing it into his mouth. Every so often, he\u2019d repeat this movement,\
  \ making sure not to lift his gaze from the transfixing fiction he held onto with\
  \ his other hand. His soft features were calming and inviting even though he was\
  \ a stranger and as I passed his table, I crouched down to pick up his bookmark\
  \ that had fallen to the ground. \u201CCiao, tu segnalibro?,\u201D I asked as I\
  \ placed it on the table. \u201CGrazie mille,\u201D he responded. After a few pleasantries,\
  \ I discovered that his name was Giovanni and he suggested that I try his favorite\
  \ gelato flavor, crema di grom, which had pastry cream with corn biscuits and chocolate\
  \ chips. It was a brief encounter; no need to make it into more than that, but in\
  \ those 10 minutes of conversation, it felt as though we had known each other for\
  \ years. Peter and Marcella interrupted the evening and we headed to our hotel to\
  \ rest for the next day.\n\nOur last day in Venice began with a water taxi to the\
  \ Riva Degli Schiavone that continued to the Bridge of Sighs at sunrise. While I\
  \ was enjoying the view of the warm hues meeting the colors of the chill waters,\
  \ a face I recognized could be seen peeking over an easel of acrylic paints on canvas.\
  \ I was shocked! Giovanni waved me over to where he was painting and we talked while\
  \ I admired the exact replica of the sunset that was before us. I didn\u2019t want\
  \ to seem too eager, so I stayed calm and collected until he suggested we enjoy\
  \ the day together. My friends paid no mind to my decision, and Giovanni escorted\
  \ me through the Piazza San Marco, the Rialto Bridge, and many other tourist spots\
  \ I had yet to visit. While weaving through the streets and canals of Venice, we\
  \ talked about every topic imaginable; what our aspirations were, our favorite books,\
  \ and which part of the city was our favorite. I only had a few hours left in Venice,\
  \ so at dusk, he took me to a spot off of the Grand Canal and surprised me with\
  \ a gondola ride. The views were breath-taking and since our gondolier wasn\u2019\
  t a singer, I decided to sing an Italian aria I had learned in college; \u201CAh\
  \ cielo, di piu non chiedo! Si puo morir d\u2019amore!\u201D which translated, \u201C\
  oh heavens, I could ask for nothing more! Yes, I could die of love!\u201D"
