Text: "What\u2019s the first image that pops up in your mind when I utter the word\
  \ \u201CGoa\u201D? I bet it is of pristine beaches with swaying palm trees and sun-bathing\
  \ tourists. On my second trip to Goa, I decided to go off the beaten path and visit\
  \ Fontainhas, the old Latin quarters, in Panjim. \nLeaving behind the bustling market\
  \ of Panjim, I started walking towards the quieter Fontainhas. The church bell started\
  \ tolling and my feet tapped with its rhythm. At crossroads, I was greeted by a\
  \ captivating red house with a conical, tiled roof and arched windows made of shells.\
  \ Soon I got immersed in the lanes filled with houses painted in myriad hues. It\
  \ felt as if I had entered a child\u2019s imagination. The houses built in Indo-Portuguese\
  \ style have tiled roofs, spacious balconies, roosters on rooftops and ornate nameplates.\
  \ Boutique shops selling ceramic houses, porcelain figurines and decorative plates\
  \ abound in the area.\nWhile I was engrossed in clicking pictures, a woman approached\
  \ me and asked, \u201CWhy are you taking pictures?\u201D I was flabbergasted by\
  \ the question and replied peevishly that I was clicking the houses because I wanted\
  \ to. She pointed to an orange house and said that it belonged to her granny. And\
  \ then she told me that she would take me to an amazing little bakery. She literally\
  \ grabbed my hand and dragged me to the bakery in one of the bylanes of the area,\
  \ simply called \u201CConfeitaria\u201D. It\u2019s a small bakery with outside seating\
  \ and the table tops are made of tiles decorated by Mario Miranda, the renowned\
  \ cartoonist. \nMy new friend, the kind Svetlana, offered me a Swiss-Roll which\
  \ was so fresh and tasty that it instantly melted in my mouth. I thanked her and\
  \ asked her about the roosters on the top of the houses. She explained, \u201CWe\
  \ were with the Portuguese at the time of the building of the houses. The rooster\
  \ is the national bird of Portugal. So all the houses have roosters on top.\u201D\
  \ She wanted to show me a chapel at the end of another lane but she was in such\
  \ a hurry that I couldn\u2019t take pictures of the vibrant houses. So I let her\
  \ go ahead, leaving behind a sweet Swiss-Roll induced taste in my mouth and a memory\
  \ to last my entire life. Have you ever encountered such an indulgent stranger too?\
  \ Her warm gesture inspired me to be more generous towards unrelated people. A single\
  \ act of kindness can leave an indelible impression in someone\u2019s life. And\
  \ what is life without the smiles and joy that we can bring to others?\nEntering\
  \ into another lane in this enchanting area, I was fascinated by the ornate doors\
  \ and plants kept on the window sills. A picturesque white chapel with an imposing\
  \ facade and a bell stood majestically at the end of the road. On turning right\
  \ from the chapel, I found an old well painted in red and white with two white roosters\
  \ on the top its pillars. The well is now filled with mud and green plants were\
  \ shooting out of it. One never knows what jewels are hidden at unexpected corners\
  \ in these maze-like lanes. Nearby two cats were lazing around on a yellow wall.\
  \ They were the embodiment of susegad \u2013 the art of relaxing and enjoying life\
  \ to the fullest \u2013 like true Goans.  \nLater I walked into a caf\xE9 called\
  \ The Old Quarter - The Hostel Crowd. It has a poster that reads, \u201Cthe beach\
  \ is boring\u201D. While roaming in the streets of Fontainhas that statement seems\
  \ validated. Sipping hot coffee and gazing at the zigzag lines of the colourful\
  \ houses, I thought about how blessed one is to be able to travel and to be mesmerised\
  \ by beauty \u2013 beauty of buildings, people, animals and plants. I realised the\
  \ perks of exploring a place by walking around with no particular destination in\
  \ mind. I made friends with locals and indulged in impromptu conversations; appreciated\
  \ the architecture; and tasted the yummiest-ever Swiss Roll. Isn\u2019t that what\
  \ travel should be about?"
