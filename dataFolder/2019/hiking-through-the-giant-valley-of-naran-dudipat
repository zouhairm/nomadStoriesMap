Text: "Collecting the group of about eight people we fled from Peshawar early morning\
  \ in the month of July. The travel engulfed the whole day in reaching Naran but\
  \ because of the jubilant company and serenity of the greenery outside the window\
  \ pleasant our eyes and fueled our hormones at each spot never realized us when\
  \ did that happened. The chattering and high fives continued till mid night until\
  \ we cannot resist our eyes anymore and slept in the complete dark and silence.\
  \ \n\nA cold gush of wind aroused me early morning next day when I opened my half\
  \ eyes heading out of blanket conceiving the message of adjustment with cold weather.\
  \ As per planning we pumped for the journey toward Babusar Top at height of 13691\
  \ feet in the picturesque drive in four wheels where we were jolting with our own\
  \ lyrics and bashing taunts on one another. The jagged mountains of Babusar Top\
  \ flooded with natural lakes stunned us as we were approaching the valley with the\
  \ breeze keeping us alive every second we spend there.\n\nIce shooting and photo\
  \ sessions were done and we grab our way back to make tent at our start up point\
  \ of our most awaiting part of our trip. The real Creditors were Sardar and Aziz\
  \ in making the tents sophisticated way right on the bank of river. The gentle sound\
  \ of water flow acted as lullaby that surrounded us with deep sleep. At 06 30 am\
  \ we were hit by the sound \u201CAlakano pasay Nawakhta kege\u201D Get Up as it\
  \ Getting Late. I was so absorbed in the sleep that for the few seconds I found\
  \ the call like a morning alarm but then realized that the call was for one of my\
  \ adventurous mornings of my life.\n\nWe have to embark our journey some few miles\
  \ away from Lulusur Lake called Besal and to cover about 18 km distance from one\
  \ side to reach Dudipatsar Lake. As we stepped on we have cross a little river in\
  \ what local language Called \u2018Zango\u201D. With each step we got the formidable\
  \ gain of elevation but also rewarded us with spectacular glimpse of glaciers and\
  \ unique massive mountains. The mountains become bared as we traversed along the\
  \ route.\n\nTricky streams have to be crossed along the way through single lying\
  \ wood bridges connecting the both ends with lush greenery and galloping horses\
  \ grazing in the mysterious meadows. After every kilometer we meet with kids and\
  \ local elders wearing torn Clothes constantly asking for some headache and fever\
  \ tablets the value of which was worth dollars in that hilly track.\n\nThe sound\
  \ of ice crunching under my feet, small crystal clear streams reflecting my face\
  \ images coming time by time and white clouds overhead made the trek languid and\
  \ astounding. As we were pleading we started seeing crevasses and as we advanced\
  \ the number of crevasse become greater with sheets of glaciers hide beyond our\
  \ eye sights. All this giving me the immense pleasure that I have found a paradise\
  \ on earth and visiting here  pleasant my eyes diversify my mind and release my\
  \ adrenaline.\n\nAfter almost we have travelled for about six to seven hours we\
  \ reached Mulla K Basti the relaxation point for trekkers before they head towards\
  \ Dudipat Lake. The elevation we were gaining become more demanding Done with some\
  \ good rest and started again to Dudipatsar Lake with flowers glittering and dancing\
  \ constantly with breeze on the track.\n\nAt Dudipat Lake a man having tent with\
  \ small kitchen inside trembling with the cold offering \u201CGaram Paratas\u201D\
  \ \_and we washed them down with wonderful milky Chaye (Tea) at the spot before\
  \ we leave that place. As we headed back a strong rain hit us with water running\
  \ everywhere making extreme difficult for us to reach our destination. But we were\
  \ lucky enough to see the sheets of rain ends up and grab an enjoyable weather to\
  \ step down.\n\nWe trekked about 36 km (18 kms from each side) in the mountains\
  \ for whole day. Everyone flooded with exhaustion and slept as soon as we find our\
  \ bed in the tent enjoyed the deep sleep under the background of river flow."
