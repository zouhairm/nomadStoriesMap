Text: "It was Chimamanda Adichie, the renowned Nigerian writer, who said the problem\
  \ with stereotypes is not that they are untrue but that they are incomplete. We\
  \ always try to fight the single stereotypical story that others have of us and\
  \ forget those that we have of ourselves, and our kind. \nIn April 2018, I decided\
  \ to visit my grandmother in the rural village that she lived in Akwa Ibom state,\
  \ southern Nigeria. Ikot Nya was a small beautiful village, it smelled different\
  \ \u2014 free of pollution and that toxic scramble for activities. It boasted of\
  \ many women who rode bikes \u2014 an uncommon feat in many places in Nigeria. Every\
  \ side of the road was flanked by tall trees and for a moment, I felt that global\
  \ warming would never reach Ikot Nya because they went green all the way. I had\
  \ never returned since childhood. \nShe lived in a house that was half mud and half\
  \ cement. It did not have a bathroom or toilet and so you had to do your business\
  \ in the bare earth and bathe in the open surrounded by trees and flowers. In the\
  \ morning, we would roast corns with wood fire, and at night eat foo foo with okra\
  \ soup. \nI could not communicate with my grandmother because I did not speak Ibibio\
  \ and she did not speak English. Still, she would sit by the mat where I slept and\
  \ talk to me for hours. I decided to record all our conversations and smile at everything\
  \ she said, at things I did not understand. As I packed my bags to leave, she hugged\
  \ me tightly. I held her hands tightly till I climbed into my Aunty's jalopy. Before\
  \ we drove off, she shouted some words after me. I wrote them down quickly before\
  \ I could forget.\nBack in school, I spent a whole day with my coursemate, Antia,\
  \ who understood Ibibio. When she was done with the translations, I was shocked.\
  \ I held the paper with all the translations beautifully written in Antia's perfect\
  \ cursive. Grandma had spoken of race, class, politics, culture and of feminism.\
  \ I never thought she understood those things, intricately. I never thought she\
  \ understood anything happening outside of her small village. I had always been\
  \ of the opinion that rural dwellers did not understand modern Africa.\n In Africa,\
  \ there is a massive exodus occurring because people are leaving the rural areas\
  \ and going for the urban. No one wants to be associated with rural life, or rural\
  \ people. For many of us, rural is where you can be when there is nowhere else to\
  \ be. For many of us, rural means illiterate. \nMy coursemate had looked at me with\
  \ a smile before she left. \"The last thing she said,\" she started, \"while you\
  \ were being driven off, was that if no man would regard you, you must learn to\
  \ regard yourself.\"\nI felt shame rise from the sole of my feet to the crown of\
  \ my head. I regret that I was unable to talk to her, to ask questions, to watch\
  \ her mouth form those words as I listened attentively. I regret my inability to\
  \ communicate.\nNow, I'm learning to speak Ibibio so that when I visit again, I\
  \ would tell her all the many things that I want to. Now, I spend more time with\
  \ elderly people than I spend with my age mates. In their dyed wrappers, faded shorts\
  \ and milk white fairly-too-large singlets; they speak of the world like seasoned\
  \ philosophers. I like this aspect of my life; an aspect that sprung out from things\
  \ I never expected to find."
