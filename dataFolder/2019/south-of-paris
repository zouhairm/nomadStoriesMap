Text: "It was my closest experience to a rainforest without visiting one. A chunk\
  \ of France that lay south western from Paris, yet north of Cannes.\nAn epilogue\
  \ to roaring claps of thunder and a light show of electricity in the sky that reminded\
  \ me of a concert, humidity clung to the air and rose in a cloud of mist. It moved\
  \ up through the valley below our quaint g\xEEte like a solid monster, hiding much\
  \ of the canopy underneath, yet moistening the ground thoroughly. \n\nOur party\
  \ of six, seven with the dog, learned about the effects of humidity on the ground\
  \ the hard way; a giant minibus stuck out as though it were some alien craft in\
  \ amongst farm vehicles, some similar in age to fossils. The colossal wheels flattened\
  \ damp earth, leaving a tire tread that no local had seen before, one man looked\
  \ as though he were staring at a yeti footprint. \nBut these wheels proved no match,\
  \ one wrong turn down the incorrect path and said wheels were submerged almost instantly.\
  \ \n\nWe were forced to get out and trudge towards a small sanctuary of grass, orange\
  \ mud caking dress shoes and tanned legs. The French sun had been kind to our skin,\
  \ yet not to our path ahead. \nA sign was substituted for a shovel in an attempt\
  \ to claw the mud away from the wheels, it became clear almost immediately that\
  \ this was only causing the minibus to sink further.\nThe nearest village was a\
  \ couple of minutes walk up a hill. According to a sign the population stands at\
  \ 195, with one business running the entire economy of the small hamlet. A Michelin\
  \ Star restaurant. \n\nIt was in this moment that I realised the universal language\
  \ of being quagmire bound, the villagers spoke no English but helped us regardless.\
  \ Igniting the engines of tractors that, albeit antiquated, still managed to tow\
  \ the minibus free from the bog. \n\nThe sun was slipping down and the dying light\
  \ only permitted a cloud of hungry mosquitos to descend, dining on us before we\
  \ could dine at the restaurant. \nIt wasn\u2019t a gimmick, nor some uncommon French\
  \ humour that could only be understood by the inhabitants of Les Arques; the Michelin\
  \ Star quality was present in every dish that we received. I speak little french,\
  \ so much of what I ordered came to be a pleasant mystery, the adrenaline that had\
  \ accumulated from the previous adventure retroceded, my tastebuds now embarking\
  \ on their own unexpected travels."
