Text: "I woke up at four o\u2019clock. I cannot stop thinking about the walls. I am\
  \ in Bernauer Strasse, a street on the former border between Berlin oriental and\
  \ occidental. A place where people throw themselves into freedom by jumping through\
  \ the windows and wall and building tunnels.\nI do yoga classes and think about\
  \ walls. I know, there is no wall anymore. But I\u2019m from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\
  \ The country where I was born is known worldwide for having the most murderous\
  \ police in the world. And my state has become a kind of laboratory of reactionary\
  \ policies against mostly poor and black people. \nI can feel this wall in me and\
  \ I struggle myself violently with it. I hate it so much that my whole body stiffens\
  \ in reaction. Because I want to destroy it. \nEvery day, at 7 a.m., I started the\
  \ practice. I salute the sun ten times, Surya A and B. The teacher touches my shoulders\
  \ and shows me that I'm not being flexible, that I put a lot of tension all over\
  \ the shoulder girdle, and I breathe desperately. \u201CTake air with energy and\
  \ release it gently,\" she says. Five repetitions and my shoulders hurt, but I keep\
  \ firmly because I want so hard to continue. She asks me to stop. I am the wall.\
  \ I sit and watch the class. I see the vigor in the movements, the desire, the expression,\
  \ the fear, and the joy. \u201CHere (on the mat) you can fight with your demons\u201D\
  , she advises me. \nThen, suddenly, I stare at a young woman with oriental traces.\
  \ I get completely trapped in the softness of her gestures. There is no hurry, there\
  \ is no end and there is no beginning. She just pulls the lines as someone who weaves\
  \ her own existence with infinite pleasure. I am infected by this kind of patience,\
  \ which makes me wish not to reach the end of the postures, nor finish them, but\
  \ start again, learn how to cross them daily. This tenderness for being present\
  \ becomes unbearable in light of my body-wall, whose limits were deeply established.\
  \ And although I know I am not the wall, I have grown accustomed to stopping at\
  \ its borders and cursing the border patrol, asking for permission to exist, doing\
  \ exactly what the wall demands from me: recognize its power over me, triggering\
  \ it at any step I want to take.\nThe walls are like the borders, it aims to determine\
  \ what the subject can do, taking away the ability to create new possibilities.\
  \ To affirm desire then implies learning to look at the wall without being astonished\
  \ to believe that everything is already determined, to the point that we do not\
  \ even dare to wish to produce cracks. You have to learn to deal with the wall.\n\
  Hating the wall is not dealing with the wall, but submit to the point of being hostage\
  \ to it, to be something identified. A stiff or amorphous body can also be a wall.\n\
  I imagine that the Japanese in front of me also experiences the wall because somehow\
  \ the walls constitute all of us, they are like the language or the norms that precede\
  \ us. But I believe she uses the movement itself to make the wall inside of her\
  \ flexible. Her own existence at that moment puts the wall in check, and perhaps\
  \ with such tenderness that the wall does not complain, nor perceive.\nWhile watching\
  \ her, my extreme tiredness, typical of those who are obsessed with destroying the\
  \ wall, collapses and I cry. And when I cry, I feel this wall weaken, and I can\
  \ feel myself weak, imperfect, fragile, and something brand new break out in myself:\
  \ the wall of power becomes the will of potency. Will of potency is very different\
  \ from the wall of power: the wall of power separates people from what they can.\
  \ Will of potency is the pleasure of achievement, but not the achievement that leads\
  \ to people submission, but the one that has the same meaning when it is said that\
  \ a painter has conquered a color. Bernauer Strasse makes me believe in these old\
  \ new colors: freedom."
