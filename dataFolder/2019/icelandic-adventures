Text: "I remember once reading a quote from Into the Wild during a horrifying moment\
  \ in my trip to Iceland. Back then, I was just so young and full of dreams that\
  \ even the most dangerous moments appeared very bright to me. \n\u201CThe joy of\
  \ life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater\
  \ joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and\
  \ different sun.\u201D - Jon Krakauer\nIt was somewhat past midnight and it was\
  \ completely dark outside. We were driving through Iceland\u2019s main road in order\
  \ to get to the next hotel that we had booked. It was early March, 2016, and there\
  \ was so much snow that I even felt depressed by looking at so much whiteness during\
  \ the past days. Through the car windows, we could not see anything at all and we\
  \ had to trust our lives on the GPS, which was showing the huge mountains on the\
  \ right side and the ocean on the left side. On the left side of the car was an\
  \ abyss leading towards the sea and the snow was very heavy everywhere. \nWe were\
  \ very tired and scared. We had been driving practically the whole day and did not\
  \ have much to eat as well. We decided the best decision was to call the hotel and\
  \ let they know we would come very late, and so we did not need to hurry. The next\
  \ stop was in Hofn, a very small town in Iceland that seemed a nice spot to spend\
  \ the night. However, it was past midnight and we still had more than two hours\
  \ until Hofn, making it very unlikely to get to, considering the weather conditions.\
  \ \nWe drove a little more when we saw a sign in the road: \u201CHvalnes closed\u201D\
  . I knew there was something wrong. My friend who was driving, being very stubborn\
  \ and reckless, promise us that it probably was referring to some touristic attraction\
  \ and kept going for a little while. I decided to look up on the weather website,\
  \ as Iceland authorities update it very often in case there are avalanches or snowstorms\
  \ blocking the roads. I went online in the middle of nowhere and I confirmed it:\
  \ there had been an avalanche exactly on the road to Hofn. Exactly on our way. The\
  \ avalanche had just happened, probably around thirty minutes before.\nI could not\
  \ breathe for a while. I decided to let my friends know that we were in real danger\
  \ and that we needed to make a quick decision, a lifesaving decision. We decided\
  \ to take a step back and turn around, because driving into an avalanche in the\
  \ middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, would probably have been insane\
  \ and mortal. We went back a little while trying to find any other small towns where\
  \ we could find a hotel to spend the rest of the night. The town we stopped was\
  \ Djupivogur, eastern Iceland. We found a hotel but it was a horrible experience:\
  \ the attendant was grumpy and impolite and almost did not let us in. \nThe next\
  \ morning everything looked more calm and bright, but there was still a heavy snow\
  \ falling. It was my turn to drive in the morning, and soon after leaving the hotel\
  \ we passed through the avalanche spot. There were men taking the huge blocks of\
  \ ice and dirt from the road, it had completely ruined the road. I felt very lucky\
  \ that we did not kept driving; otherwise, we could have been in a real trouble.\
  \ \nWe continued our trip safely after what probably was the scariest night of my\
  \ entire life. The road was never the same again, just as I was never the same.\
  \ That night I read the quote from Into the Wild to my friends in the car in order\
  \ to calm us down and to remind us that it was fine to get in trouble if our purpose\
  \ was big enough. By that time, our purpose was to live life to the fullest\u2026\
  \ and we did it."
