Text: "Pondicherry,  in the southern part of India, is surely lazy little town with\
  \ French quarters and a week's trip is the perfect blissful getaway for serenity\
  \ and calm.\n\nDay 1\nIt was Sunday, and it lent a perfect laziness to the atmosphere\
  \ that even eateries opened up lazily. The first thing we learnt about Pondy was,\
  \ invest in a hat & wear it everywhere (its hot out there!) and secondly, you can\
  \ walk the whole French quarter with the help of Google maps! Our first stop was\
  \ Indian Kaffe Express where we had a sumptuous breakfast and then roamed around\
  \ the quarter loving the whole French feel of the area. The exotic Rues and Boulevards\
  \ and the brightly coloured buildings are a sight you wont get tired of! Our next\
  \ stop was the famous Baker Street. The rush on Christmas Eve made us leave soon\
  \ and we explored the market for a while, queuing up at Cafe Xtasi for their well-known\
  \ pizzas. Our day ended with a nice walk at the Promenade.\n\n\nDay 2\nThe next\
  \ day, we headed to Cafe des Art for breakfast and it became our favourite spot\
  \ for the rest of the trip.\n\nNext we headed to Auroville, the sanctuary of peace\
  \ and a universal community based in the lap of nature. The scenic walk around Auroville\
  \ was a peaceful one and the Visitor's Centre houses 3 boutique shops and a lovely\
  \ little bookshop. We headed to Dreamer's Cafe to grab a cuppa and had a really\
  \ nice gelato, created in Auroville!\n\nKalki on Mission Street is a lifestyle boutique\
  \ that one must visit & so is the Hidesign store if you're a fan of leather. I found\
  \ Casablanca to be the best, decked up like a candy store!\n\nIt was Christmas and\
  \ we could not miss the brightly lit beautiful church. We visited Eglise de notre\
  \ Dame des Anges - Our Lady of Angels church and enjoyed the Christmasy vibes!\n\
  \n\nDay 3\nTuesday saw us turning into beach babies as we set out for Paradise Beach.\
  \ The ferry ride was as much fun as the pristine beach!\n\nOur saviour in desperate\
  \ times of hunger and low-budget, were Hotel Surguru and A2B Adyar Anand Bhavan\
  \ which serve really delicious South-Indian food and doesn't burn a hole in your\
  \ pocket!\n\nDay 4\nWednesday morning I was excited as I had booked a heritage walk\
  \ in the evening with Storytrails. And I had planned to attend a night-long Tamil\
  \ folk dance-drama show of Ravana Samharam (Ramayan) at Adishakti (near Auroville),\
  \ an artists' residency and institute for performance. We headed to Pondicherry\
  \ Museum, which tells a lot about the history of this sleepy little town, and had\
  \ a nice afternoon siesta lying under a shady tree in Bharathi park.\n\nDuring the\
  \ heritage walk, we went around talking about the history and culture and prominent\
  \ personalities of Pondicherry, and we visited the 500-year old Sri Manakula Vinayagar\
  \ Temple of Ganesha.\n The show at Adishakti was a colourful, rustic folk musical\
  \ of olden times. It's not a place to be missed if you're an artist!\n\nDay 5\n\
  We decided to go sight-seeing to Mahabalipuram - home to UNESCO World Heritage-listed\
  \ temples, caves and rocks and a beach! The amazing architecture of the Panch Rathas\
  \ and the shore temple are a thing of beauty!\n\nDay 6\nIt was finally Friday and\
  \ I was really excited to experience whatever MatriMandir had in store for me. Amazing\
  \ architecture coupled with an awe-inspiring aura and an unparalleled meditative\
  \ experience amidst deafening silence, is an introspective experience nobody should\
  \ miss!  The rest of the day was spent visiting Basilica of the Sacred Heart of\
  \ Jesus, the Aurobindo Ashram and the Ashram Trust that creates organic perfumes\
  \ and cosmetics.\n\nDay 7\nIt was the last day of the year, last day of the trip\
  \ and Pondicherry felt like home.\n\nThe evening called for celebrations to welcome\
  \ the new year! We headed out to look around at awesomely lit Secretariat building\
  \ and govt. sponsored public celebration for tourists and locales ending with fireworks\
  \ at the Promenade, welcoming the new year, which was a spectacular sight! As we\
  \ left Pondicherry the next morning, I knew I'm surely going there back again some\
  \ day!"
