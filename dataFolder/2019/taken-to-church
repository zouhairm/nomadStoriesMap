Text: "I was six days into a seventeen-day backpacking trip in Costa Rica with my\
  \ friend Lucy. We had spent the last twenty-four hours travelling along cloud forest\
  \ bridges, night time jungle footpaths and soring above valleys on a zipline but\
  \ our time in Monteverde was up. We were catching a bus back to San Jose, a place\
  \ we had already been and found eye wateringly boring. \nOn the bus we got chatting\
  \ to Marco Molina, a nineteen-year-old freelance photographer, journalist, illustrator,\
  \ eco-warrior and practicing Christian. His appearance made him look older with\
  \ his dark curly hair tied back in a scruffy ponytail and sporting better designer\
  \ stubble than I was able to produce. During our journey together, Marco showed\
  \ us his impressive camera equipment, told us about the issues Costa Rica pretends\
  \ it doesn\u2019t have, his intention of going to Germany as a missionary and tried\
  \ in a vain attempt to improve our Spanish. I was very impressed by Marco. He was\
  \ very mature for his age and I liked his attitude and mentality towards life and\
  \ work. \nTowards the end of our journey, Marco asked us if we wanted to join him\
  \ at a church service that evening. This is when alarm bells started to ring for\
  \ me. It was all too convenient. Conveniently that evening and conveniently just\
  \ around the corner from our hostel. Hostel Pangea was our destination in the Am\xF3\
  n district. We had stayed here before and loved it as it had everything we looked\
  \ for in a hostel. A pool, murals and artwork on every available surface, hammocks,\
  \ a bar complete with dance floor and pole, onsite restaurant and more importantly\
  \ at this point, a heavy gate and front door you needed to be buzzed through. Previously\
  \ we visited a bar on the corner of the block, close to Marco\u2019s church, which\
  \ appeared to be the drop off point for ladies on the night shift, if you catch\
  \ my meaning. It could have been the way Marco brought it up but it felt like the\
  \ film \u201CTaken\u201D but neither mine or Lucy\u2019s dad was Liam Neeson. We\
  \ told Marco that it had been a long day for us already and we were a bit tired\
  \ but if we felt up for it after we had checked into our room we would pop along.\
  \ \nWe did end up sharing a taxi with Marco to outside our hostel (just like in\
  \ Taken) where he went around the corner and we ran into the safety of our hostel.\
  \ Talking to Lucy in our room I discovered that she had the exact same bells going\
  \ off. We weighed up the options and decided to leave the safety of the hostel to\
  \ scout the place out. \nTurns out we had nothing to fear whatsoever. Hosted by\
  \ the New Life New Glory Ministries, this was one of the friendliest and most casual\
  \ church services I have ever seen, filled with people who just wanted to share\
  \ God\u2019s love and not rob us blind and dispose of our bodies in a ditch. Marco\
  \ was so happy to see us and it appeared that he saved us two seats right at the\
  \ front with him. I felt bad walking past everyone in the middle of the service.\
  \ It was being led by a very charismatic American called Sam Wingenbach who had\
  \ been living in San Jose for the last year and Chile for two years before that.\
  \ He had a Spanish interpreter but some things got lost in translation with some\
  \ of Sam\u2019s more obscure metaphors. Towards the end of the service, when everyone\
  \ else was doing their final prayers, Lucy and I were looking around, unsure what\
  \ to do. We reckon Sam clocked us as non-believers (along with turning up very late\
  \ and being the two whitest people in the audience) and came over to say hello when\
  \ it was finished. He was a really nice guy and very easy to talk to. Before we\
  \ left, he said a little prayer for our safety on our trip and to see lots of \u201C\
  awesome stuff\u201D. It could have been the prayer, it could have been luck, but\
  \ we did."
