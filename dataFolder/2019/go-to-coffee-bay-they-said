Text: "There was a roar of cheering, then we all squirmed. The moth had flown back\
  \ in to the web and the spider was heading towards it. Sat in hammocks and slightly\
  \ stoned, we couldn\u2019t believe it, he\u2019d escaped twice already! Maybe, it\u2019\
  d been scared by our excessive cheering last time it got away! \n\n\u201CMake sure\
  \ you go to Coffee Bay\u201D said every backpacker I met in South Africa. It was\
  \ 2003 and I was headed to Durban. Coffee Bay was on the way. On arrival, I was\
  \ greeted with rolling green hills scattered with bright blue huts\u2026 a long\
  \ way from the shanty towns in Cape Town. The rugged coastline reminded me of home.\
  \ \n\nThe signs on the toilet doors encouraged the men to 'water the garden' instead\
  \ of block up the congested toilets, and not give sweets to the children (as there\
  \ are no dentists in the area). Another sign asked us not to encourage the 'begging\
  \ culture' by giving money to any of the locals as there were community programs\
  \ encouraging children and locals to make bracelets and knick knacks to sell. Other\
  \ locals sold 'fresh produce' which was always welcomed and sought after by the\
  \ backpackers!\n \nWe spent our days exploring, laughing, swimming, cliff jumping\
  \ and being alive. Although a trip like this wouldn\u2019t be complete without some\
  \ shenanigans and my new Irish friends didn\u2019t disappoint. Aside from their\
  \ uncanny ability to lose their camera and have it returned daily (if not hourly)\
  \ by strangers, they stepped it up a notch when they actually lost the film from\
  \ inside! Thankfully they left the Transkei alive even though one opened the car\
  \ door to take a photo of the scenery, somehow forgetting the car was travelling\
  \ about 100km per hour. \n\nI was also happy to leave the Transkei alive. To get\
  \ to the closest beach you had to cross a river. The river joined the ocean and\
  \ could only be crossed safely at low tide. I was alone and the river was rising.\
  \ After walking along the edge looking for the safest place to cross, I waded through\
  \ the water watching the waves crash in front of me, when all of a sudden, the river\
  \ started flowing out to sea even faster. I didn\u2019t know which way to go. Thankfully\
  \ a dread locked, river guiding hippy arrived at just the perfect time. He grabbed\
  \ a big stick and stepping over to me, pulled me back to the rivers edge. A huge\
  \ tree swept past where I had been standing, it would\u2019ve easily taken me out.\
  \ It must have fallen across the river at some point, holding back the water. As\
  \ it released, it brought the power of the river with it. Realising I could\u2019\
  ve just died, made me also realise I should probably have contacted home more often\
  \ so people knew where I was!\n\nMy guardian angel disappeared as quickly as he\u2019\
  d appeared and I walked back to the Coffee Shack Backpackers, grateful for life\
  \ and ready for my next adventure."
