Text: "It was the August of 2017, I had just done a successful group show in Jaipur,\
  \ collaborating with artists from all around India and had long planned my trip\
  \ to Chennai and Auroville. I was to visit my friend Suri in Chennai. As I reached\
  \ her house, I was met by her boyfriend and her very friendly puppy, Osho. She jumped\
  \ on me, her paws digging into my skin and clothes, I got a bit scared because this\
  \ was the closest I had been to a dog. An hour later I had warmed up to her. Post\
  \ dinner we picked up another friend of ours from the airport.\nThe next day we\
  \ got up in the morning and caught a bus to Pondicherry. It took three hours to\
  \ reach. We hired two scooters and rode our way to Auroville. We rode through Promenade\
  \ beach and Osho Ashram, and after an hour reached our destination Auroville. \n\
  We stayed at New Creation Guest House. I made friends with a dog called Doobie.\
  \ He was mostly playful in the nights, one night he snatched my cheesecake from\
  \ hand and started running in the other direction. The next night he kept tugging\
  \ on my black scarf till I let it go. \nThe first two days we went to all the Auroville\
  \ destinations that one will find prescribed in a travel book. From far away, the\
  \ small orb of Maitri Mandir started growing larger and larger as we went closer.\
  \ As I walked closer towards it and inside the huge campus, I found myself enamoured\
  \ by the beauty of the architecture. The cemented petals, water flowing through\
  \ the vertical columns, red ambience, convex orbs, a single ray of light, people\
  \ meditating and complicated stairways were no less than dystopian or utopian aesthetics.\
  \ Within the sphere, I found myself transported to a dimension where time and space\
  \ react to form a different cosmology than the real world where I come from. \n\
  I checked out a few art spaces, which is basically all the buildings in Auroville.\
  \ \nThe third day, Mehr had left and I and Suri had extravagant plans of cycling\
  \ through the city. We packed some loaves of bread from Auroville Bakery and hired\
  \ two cycles. We cycled around the earthy roads of Auroville. TWe stopped at an\
  \ old nursery and cycled around Maitri Mandir and met with a cafe and started cycling\
  \ again. We passed a potter\u2019s open studio, a travel company\u2019s office which\
  \ looked like a cafe and we reached the interiors. We must have trespassed because\
  \ I heard distant barks, and a second later fast-paced footsteps. I expressed sudden\
  \ stress to Suri to which she replied \u2018Just keep moving\u2019. A second later\
  \ 3 guard dogs came running after us and we doubled our speed. They kept barking\
  \ after us. I looked sideways at one of the dogs, it looked at me and barked loudly.\
  \ This must have gone on for a full 10 minutes. There were times when I got ahead\
  \ of Suri and there were times when she got ahead of me. Every time we passed each\
  \ other, our eyes met and I saw worry and adventure blazing in her eyes. We kept\
  \ on cycling without realising that the barks have receded and we entered into the\
  \ jungle. The pathways had become eerily thin and wild crept onto the narrow bare\
  \ earth. We stopped for a while wondering where to go, forward did not look like\
  \ a way to go and backwards could have the wretched dogs waiting for us. My phone\
  \ died as soon as I wanted to see which way to go. Finally, we cycled backwards.\
  \ I could see the footmarks of dogs in the loose sand. Luckily, I saw a diversion\
  \ and we took that path. It meant the world to us when we saw a man riding a motorcycle\
  \ and coming in our direction. We asked him, \u2018Where are we?\u2019 he seemed\
  \ to have not heard our question and said, \u2018What are you guys doing here, you\
  \ have reached the adjacent village. He told us the route to Auroville. We ate a\
  \ lavish dinner at Tanto\u2019s to commemorate our survival."
