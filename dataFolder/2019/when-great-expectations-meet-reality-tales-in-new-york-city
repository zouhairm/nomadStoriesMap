Text: "I had pined over and dreamed up a trip to New York City for so many years.\
  \ Finally, in 2018, the time had come.\nBags packed, journal ready. Hello, land\
  \ of dreams, and bagels.\nUpon arriving, I am sleep deprived but recharged by pure\
  \ adrenaline. It feels like a fairytale to be here in this grimy, magnificent city.\n\
  Waking up on my first full day, I jump out of bed realising I\u2019ve slept half\
  \ the day away. No time to spare and it\u2019s time to catch the next train from\
  \ Ralph Street.\nI am met on the train by a range of richly diverse people, ages,\
  \ stages and colours. They remind me of why I am here.\nI try to take in all of\
  \ the people and the conversations around me without appearing to do so. I am out\
  \ of my depth in the best of ways, feeling like an outsider peering in to a world\
  \ I want to join.\nStepping off the train, I am soon greeted by the Brooklyn Bridge.\
  \ I scurry my way around the streets in search of the staircase that will take me\
  \ to her.\nFor I moment I stop and stare. The locality of where my feet reside has\
  \ now sunk in. The bridge, marked by the cloudy sky and buildings on both sides\
  \ is simply a bridge, and yet in this moment it is speaking freedom to me. It is\
  \ my connection to this city that promises so much, and yet I already know will\
  \ overdeliver.\nWalking over the Brooklyn Bridge, slowly, consuming it piece by\
  \ piece, I\u2019m comforted and feel safe. I ask a stranger to take my picture.\
  \ I feel remarkably void of awkwardness as I walk alone in this big city.\nThe bridge\
  \ comes to an end too soon and I\u2019m confronted with choosing which way to go\
  \ from here. A subtle reminder that I am choosing my own adventure. I turn right.\n\
  Meandering along streets that carry such a sense of toughness and weight, I then\
  \ find myself on Fifth Avenue. I continue walking at pace, grasping in blinks of\
  \ department stores, tourists and locals.\nA long walk continued straight ahead\
  \ leads me to a small park beside the Flat Iron where pop up food stalls are set\
  \ up. It\u2019s there that I see my future, in the form of a gorgeous, hot margarita\
  \ pizza. Nothing\u2019s going to stop me now.\nLike some sort of divine New York\
  \ City setup, a man cuts in front of me. The polite side of me wins, and I stay\
  \ silent. Yet, it\u2019s only a matter of time until another man in line points\
  \ out his error. The man in question apologises and finds his way to the back of\
  \ the line. I feel like I\u2019m getting the royal NYC treatment, and it is delightful.\n\
  The days go by, and with each and every turn I am greeted by new characters, situations\
  \ and beauty that I cannot pack down into a conveniently sized box. I struggle to\
  \ form a description in my mind of the expanse and dynamics of this city. A city\
  \ that feels so uncomfortable in many ways, and yet it comforts me still.\nI leave\
  \ knowing that I\u2019ll be back. Like a piece of my heart is being kept here, and\
  \ that I\u2019ll return to it and find that it has been refined and polished.\n\
  Leaving is hard, but I can\u2019t help but look forward to the respite of a plane\
  \ seat for a little while. The city in all its glory and grime has left its visible\
  \ mark, literally and figuratively. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back, but\
  \ soon enough the taste of freedom will draw me to these city streets, and I\u2019\
  ll be comforted once again."
