Text: "Plenty of us hate shaking the feeling of jet lag, we drag ourselves out of\
  \ hotel room, desperately seeking coffee and that second round of energy to explore\
  \ day one in a new city, well look no further. It is overwhelmingly wonderful and\
  \ easy to discover so many of the cultural hotspots that Lisbon proudly has on offer.\
  \ Wether you're an early riser jumping to explore the sun soaked cobble stoned streets,\
  \ weaving through the laneways and espresso pitstops or the markets, even the hustle\
  \ and bustle, there is one thing for sure, Variety is all around you. \n\nBreakfast\
  \ hotspots, delicatessens, cafes, flower shops are mostly anywhere you roam and\
  \ all the local attractions, plus the hidden local spots are highly accessible through\
  \ the local public transport, easy to navigate, understand the locals love a great\
  \ chat, smile and waves all around.\n\nIf you're looking at pouring into the streets\
  \ of Lisbon at your own pace, there is a smorgasbord of activities to entertain\
  \ even the undecided little feet.\nMarkets, Art Galleries, Shopping, discovering\
  \ a local hidden treasure is only a glance away. If you're into history and heritage,\
  \ the city is packed with sites that connect the old and new, architecture, churches,\
  \ gardens, museums, fish markets and even a stunning view from the beach or coast\
  \ line.\n\nAll this adventuring must leave any weary traveller, thirsty and hungry\
  \ for more adventure, and we're not talking sights, we're talking flavour. \nBoasting\
  \ some of the best food and cuisines in the world, the capitol of Lisbon is packed\
  \ with restaurants, cafes, tapas bars and food stalls that would feed every foodie's\
  \ desirable heart. The best seafood in the whole of Europe are literally jumping\
  \ onto the plate, fresh, rich in flavour and character, just like it's people. \n\
  \nOne thins that brings back the crowds year after year is that this sun kissed\
  \ village roads, it makes you feel you have the entire town to yourself and then\
  \ you turn a corner and you are once again in the heartbeat of their culture. Everyday\
  \ is different, every street has a story and if some of those walls could talk,\
  \ we're sure they would say, \"Slow down, and enjoy the finer things in life.\n\n\
  If you're thinking to yourself, to much to choose from, there is something for everyone,\
  \ you could lost for a whole in the city's library alone.\nAccomodation varies but\
  \ there is always a homely feel about a terrace skyline with white laundry, music\
  \ playing in air, children running down the street with a football, couples out\
  \ for a moonlight stroll or cheeky kiss, or whether it's the nightlife, only a few\
  \ alcohol infused heartbeats away. \nThe people and locations around Lisbon screams\
  \ colour, life, culture and Love. This is defiantly a bucket list location, from\
  \ the heights of the chapel towers, to the azure coast line, from the vineyards\
  \ to the market place. Food, culture, people, history, lifestyle. Lisbon, Portugal\
  \ is the complete holiday experience, not to be missed."
