Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself dancing \u201CHare Krishna\u201D on the\
  \ Mediterranean coastline of Tel Aviv, backed up by my mother, on her 60th anniversary.\
  \ \n\nI grew up dreaming of the Dead Sea, the city of Eilat and all the pomegranate\
  \ juices that one may find near the seaside. As most of the Romanian Jews (those\
  \ still alive after the Second World War) have emigrated to Israel, my uncle Mendi,\
  \ married to Victori\u021Ba, made no exception and fled to the Holy Land years ago.\
  \ \n\nAfter they managed to build themselves a good life there, they also began\
  \ to spend their holidays in Romania. Each summer they would bring us awesome sweets\
  \ and toys and coffee and dollars, telling us all about their lives, always inviting\
  \ us to visit. Actually, mom and dad spent there some kind of a honeymoon in the\
  \ '90s, but I didn\u2019t get a chance; since I can remember, that region has always\
  \ been the scene of the Arab-Israeli conflict and no normal adult wanted to take\
  \ responsibility for me.\n\nSo I grew up with this frustration, that I have some\
  \ uncles in Israel that I want to visit, but I can not, because of the conflictual\
  \ situation and all the impudent wars. And, as you know, the Arabs have always tried\
  \ to destroy Israel, one way or another.\n\nWhen I turned 18, I told myself \"This\
  \ is it!\". But then in 2006 a second Lebanese war started (the war between Israel\
  \ and Hezbollah), and things got even worse there. And again my departure was postponed\
  \ until further notice from the Eastern front. And so on and so forth, until it\
  \ became too late. Sad to say, in October 2011 lovely Uncle Mendi was kidnapped\
  \ by Alzheimer and the old age. I remember I took a hard one at that time. I reproached\
  \ myself for not being able to go and see them one last time. \n\nLast year, when\
  \ I thought I would at least go visit Vicky together with my father, it was again\
  \ too fucking late, because that's life, unpredictable, always acting on her own.\
  \ \n\nSo here we are, me and my griefing mother, on her 60th birthday, eating israelian\
  \ icecream and dancing \u201CHare Krishna\u201D on the Tayelet promenade. \nWe came\
  \ in peace. But the thing is, my first trip abroad should have been to Israel, not\
  \ this one. And my father shouldn\u2019t have died young."
