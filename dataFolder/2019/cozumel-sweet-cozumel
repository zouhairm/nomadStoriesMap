Text: "COZUMEL, SWEET COZUMEL\n\nI truly believe that there is a force, intensely\
  \ supernatural that lures me back to the island of Cozumel year after year.  \n\n\
  Cozumel \u2013 the island that has a suspicious and overwhelmingly repugnant smell\
  \ of Mexican blankets.  \nCozumel \u2013 where of the 50,000 inhabitants, 42,000\
  \ of them are taxi drivers.\nCozumel - where a family of four, their dog and their\
  \ groceries is not considered too much for a moped.  \nCozumel \u2013 where no dish\
  \ remains meat-free as my poor vegetarian friends can attest to.  \nCozumel - where\
  \ shoes are optional, six year olds pack groceries, and drinking beer while doing\
  \ construction (or in any other work environment for that matter) is a job requirement.\n\
  \nWith the staggering influx of American tourists, to take advantage of the gingo\
  \ dollar residents have done their utmost to hone their marketing skills.  These\
  \ efforts are observed by short, round-faced, sun-kissed Mayan people dressed in\
  \ frilled tight-fitting shirts hospitably inviting me to their town by bellowing;\
  \  \u201CLet me show you sonteen!\u201D \u201CAlmost free\u201D or  \u201CHey, cunn\
  \ heere and give me a chance to reep you off!\u201D\nThen invariably, I\u2019m invited\
  \ to join some exclusive party which is taking place just up the stairs from where\
  \ a man is passed out, bottle still tightly gripped in his hand.  \n\nAs many are,\
  \ I am perpetually wary of the vicious water in Mexico. I stopped at a particular\
  \ restaurant that had a sign posted that read: \u201CThe manager has personally\
  \ passed all of the water here,\u201D which did not increase my confidence that\
  \ I would not be subject to the sacrifice of Montezuma should I devour one of their\
  \ queso fundidos or delight in one of their frozen margaritas. \nI have found that\
  \ enjoying a quiet meal on the island is an impossibility.  Invariably, nomadic\
  \ musicians with their metal-lined teeth will approach the table and assault my\
  \ eardrums with the song \u2018Cozumel\u2019 that repeats over and over in my head\
  \ until I\u2019m sure that my brain will leak out of my ears.    \n\nDespite these\
  \ completely factual observations of the island, what I didn't expect to find is\
  \ Cozumel is such charm of the people, pristine beaches, an entirely different world\
  \ under the water in the coral reefs, a home, a new country of citizenship.  \n\n\
  I would fill the pages with more endless chatter, but I must go destroy a vegetarian\
  \ beef taco, and spend my money on hats and braids.  \n\nDon Ceeendy"
