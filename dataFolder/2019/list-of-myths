Text: "A List of Myths\n\nWe were in Crete chasing myths. My friend Frank and I had\
  \ set out on an old world trip through Egypt, Turkey, and Greece to see antiquities,\
  \ but often the sheer age of things conflated reality with legend. Our visit to\
  \ the palace at Knossos that afternoon had been prime example, authentic ancient\
  \ ruins alleged to be the site of the labyrinth and the home of the Minotaur. So\
  \ we continued on the trail of tall tales and without much thought decided to drive\
  \ into the mountains to visit a cave. Ancient offerings from the Minoans were discovered\
  \ there, and mythologists posited it to be the location described in the story of\
  \ Zeus\u2019s birth. \nThe landscape of Crete befitted myth, the mountains rising\
  \ staggeringly from coast to clouds, their peaks lost in a swirl of snow and cumulus.\
  \ Somewhere up there was our destination\u2014the Lasithi Plateau, and beyond, the\
  \ Psychro Cave. We wound our way upwards through the well-watered winter green of\
  \ olive groves dotted here and there with patches of white. Soon, we were among\
  \ the clouds. Plowed snow lined the curves of the road and the green landscape gave\
  \ way to white. The going became more precarious, and at the Keras Kardiotissa monastery,\
  \ we turned around, unable to continue because of ice and trepidation.\nWe were\
  \ simultaneously disappointed and relieved, promising to return one day but happy\
  \ to have avoided disaster. Still, we felt the spirit of spontaneity, and, instead\
  \ of backtracking completely, we followed a sign to turn sideways into the village\
  \ of Krasidi. We passed a couple in an old red truck stuck in the snow just off\
  \ the road. Frank immediately suggested we get out and help. We did, and, working\
  \ together, pushed the car out without too much difficulty.  Then we said our goodbyes.\
  \ \nWe continued into the town and decided to try and spend the night there. I got\
  \ out of the car to ask around for accommodation. After finding some warm and tempting\
  \ taverns, I was answered without luck and so returned to meet Frank. \nThe car\
  \ was gone. In the swirling snow with visibility fading, my hair was turning white\
  \ years premature. \nI called him and he told me he had had to move, so I headed\
  \ back down the road we came from, stopping for some photos that did no justice\
  \ to the picturesque snow-dusted olive trees. I went some ways, almost back to where\
  \ we pushed the car, but I didn\u2019t see him. \nEventually he called me again\
  \ and told me I was mixed up. He had gone up, further into the town. So I ran a\
  \ bit up the hill, the first time in a few months since I had begun to feel the\
  \ lingering pain in my heel. It felt great.  I was bounding away like a natural\
  \ born Cretan runner.\nThen I saw his form emerging from the snow fog and he told\
  \ me the couple we had helped earlier had given him some wine and some water (only\
  \ later that night would I discover that the clear liquid was not water but Tsikoudia,\
  \ a local spirit, much to my surprise).\nWe followed the sound of voices and walked\
  \ to the main square. There was a family playing in the snow. Earlier, we had seen\
  \ several cars stopped along the way to frolic, build snowmen, or throw snowballs.\
  \ It must have been the first big snow of the season. We saw a centuries-old plane\
  \ tree in whose shade many folk had no doubt lolled away sunny summer afternoons.\
  \ I placed my palm on its cool bark. We saw a gushing aqueduct that diverted water\
  \ from the road and filled a fountain below it. I dipped my hand into its cold depths.\
  \ \nWe decided it best to return to the next town down, below the snow line. In\
  \ five minutes we were there, back to the fading light of dusk and green olive groves.\
  \ And we were wondering where and when the snowman originated. Add it to the list\
  \ of myths."
