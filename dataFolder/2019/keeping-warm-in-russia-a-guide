Text: "I\u2019d heard a lot about Russia before I embarked on my trip. My family was\
  \ concerned, who\u2019s crazy enough to visit Russia in winter, after all? But as\
  \ an Australian, I had never experienced true cold before. I don\u2019t like to\
  \ do things by halves, so Moscow seemed like the perfect way to go about it. \n\n\
  As a bisexual young lady travelling alone armed with little more than a passing\
  \ knowledge of Russian, I probably had some cause for concern. I\u2019d done my\
  \ research before I left Australia, all contradictory as information from the internet\
  \ is.\n\nI suppose, all I could really take from all that I\u2019d read and heard\
  \ was that I would have to dive in and find out for myself. \n\nWhen I took in my\
  \ first breath of frosty Russian air, I coughed it all back out. It felt like needles\
  \ in my lungs and I\u2019d thought to myself, \u2018how on earth am I going to stay\
  \ warm in this?\u2019 As it turns out, there\u2019s more to warmth than tea with\
  \ jam, fresh from the samovar, and stocking up on every kind of heat-tech Uniqlo\
  \ has ever made.\n\nTo be clear, they definitely did come in handy as well.\n\n\
  One of the things I\u2019d been most excited about for my trip was going to see\
  \ The Nutcracker in the Kremlin. I\u2019d bought my tickets months before, had to\
  \ exchange several emails with the company to secure a seat and pay for my ticket\
  \ in Russia rather than paying the horrific prices on an English site. It\u2019\
  d been an ordeal, but I was so excited. \n\nI got all dressed up, and went out,\
  \ finally got settled into my seat to watch. It was, of course, beautiful. Everything\
  \ I\u2019d hoped for, but what stuck in my memory most from that night, and from\
  \ the entire trip, was the lady I met afterwards. \n\nOnce the performance was finished,\
  \ hundreds of people came pouring out, and it was chaos. An older lady leaned over\
  \ to me to say something in Russian with a cheeky grin, looking at the mess of people.\
  \ It was one of those times where you don\u2019t really have to speak the same language\
  \ to share an inside joke. After that, we made our way through the crowds, separate\
  \ but together.\n\nWe didn\u2019t really speak for a good while as we strolled along.\
  \ I waited for her to go down the stairs at her own pace, and she seemed to understand\
  \ I was going to stay. Eventually I spoke up, telling her in terrible Russian, that\
  \ my name was Jessica, and I was Australian. \n\nFinally she understood why I was\
  \ so quiet. She spoke slower, and more carefully after that. I learned that her\
  \ name was Dina, she was 71 years old, and had lived in Moscow all her life. It\
  \ was a slippery walk over the slick cobblestones back to the train station, so\
  \ we\u2019d linked arms. She learned that I was just 21, and excitedly told how\
  \ we were exactly 50 years apart, with a little help from frozen fingers and trusty\
  \ Google Translate. I told her about how I loved Moscow, how beautiful it was. I\
  \ told her I was from Brisbane, and she said that Australia was a good place. We\
  \ laughed about our accents and we talked about the performance. \n\nWe parted ways\
  \ on different trains after telling each other to stay safe, and I suppose in the\
  \ grand scheme of things, that\u2019s just a passing encounter that means nothing.\
  \ But it meant something to me, and it meant something to her. \n\nI tried a lot\
  \ of different ways to stay warm in Russia. I tried vodka, I tried mulled wine by\
  \ the fire, I tried skating until I was sweating. \n\nYou can find warmth in the\
  \ coffee in your hands, in the steam in your face, but there\u2019s warmth in the\
  \ eyes of kind strangers too. That\u2019s the kind of warmth that stays with you\
  \ after the coffee\u2019s finished and the fire\u2019s gone out."
