Text: "It was a cold, crisp day, and having just landed in Toronto, my eyes were wide\
  \ with wonder and jet lag. Since I was visiting my best friend Amber for the first\
  \ time, there was a whole lot of Canadian things to explore. Number one had to be\
  \ the Niagara Falls.\n\nI always imagined that when I saw the Falls, I would relish\
  \ looking up at the masses of water running down in a dramatic splash, feeling overwhelmed\
  \ by the force of water. But I visited Canada in February and there was no chance\
  \ anything would be splashing \u2013 the entire waterfall was frozen. Also, spoiler\
  \ alert, you can\u2019t actually go to the bottom. And yet, it\u2019s a truly impressive\
  \ view.\n\nBut what really knocked me off my feet that day were the delicious, maple-dipped\
  \ beaver tails. The pastry type, not the Canada\u2019s national animal\u2019s body\
  \ part. Beaver tails are fabulous followed by a hot cup of double-double from Tim\
  \ Horton\u2019s. Yes, I quickly picked up the lingo \u2013 and embraced everything\
  \ my local friend introduced me to: the CN Tower and Steam Whistle Brewery, snow\
  \ shoeing in her aunt\u2019s back garden and tubing in the Blue Mountain resort.\
  \ I spent time in her hometown, visited her workplace and drank beer in her favourite\
  \ bar. I didn\u2019t feel like a tourist, a stranger, someone on their first day\
  \ at work. More like a new addition to the family.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t entirely\
  \ out of place \u2013 I always felt a strong connection to Canada. After all, ever\
  \ since I can remember and until a few years ago, my grandad lived in Toronto. I\
  \ knew Canada from his stories and letters. It seemed like the American dream kind\
  \ of land of maple opportunity \u2013 or at least it was to my grandfather looking\
  \ for a better future for his family back in Poland. Canada was where all my cool\
  \ clothes came from. My fanciest toys. And the beautifully aromatic coffee, my mum\u2019\
  s favourite. None of those things are in any way representative of Canada, but to\
  \ me aged seven that\u2019s what they were. \n\nNone of those things are unusual\
  \ in Poland now either \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t always the case. While in the late\
  \ 90s Poland was no longer a communist wasteland, if you lived in one of the poorer\
  \ areas where I\u2019m from, it sometimes felt like it. There were about two shops\
  \ where you could buy kids\u2019 clothes in my hometown so when I received pyjamas\
  \ with a huge print of my childhood hero Pocahontas \u2013 something you definitely\
  \ could not get in my town \u2013 I wore it to death. When I got my Furby, which\
  \ means nothing to anyone born after 1990 but to my generation it was the coolest\
  \ thing, I took it outside like a pet and learnt English trying to communicate with\
  \ it. In a way, despite never visiting Canada, it shaped my childhood.\n\nBut what\
  \ I considered the luxurious gifts from across the great pond, were literally my\
  \ grandpa\u2019s blood, sweat and tears. It was hours of removing asbestos from\
  \ rooftops, years of loneliness in a small basement flat and several teary goodbyes\
  \ at the end of his rare visits.\n\nSo when I finally made it to Toronto, years\
  \ after he\u2019d returned to Poland, I couldn\u2019t help but look at it through\
  \ his eyes \u2013 but with the comfort of someone one generation down, who had it\
  \ easier. \n\nI hopped along his footsteps admiring the Niagara Falls. I knew it\
  \ well from the postcard he had sent me. I admired the city\u2019s skyline with\
  \ the greediness of a curious child I felt when he sent me a picture of the view\
  \ of Toronto from across the Lake Ontario. I ploughed through the early February\
  \ snow exploring the streets of the city, wondering if he\u2019d ever stopped by\
  \ that small poutine bar my friend took me to.\n\nBetween the story of my grandpa\
  \ making Toronto his Promised Land and Amber sharing with me the places close to\
  \ her heart, I never actually felt like a stranger there. Somehow, despite the fact\
  \ it was my first time in Canada, I felt connected. And homey."
