Text: I've never traveled before to a different country. I've been to different states
  in the United states. But we always drove to where we wanted to be never been on
  a plane or a boat. Then one day I decided to go on a cruise to Mexico. We drove
  18hrs from Chicago to the ocean of Alabama it was the longest drive of my life.
  But it was totally worth it I had the chance to see a parts if the United states
  I've never seen before. I was very nervous to get on the boat an sail into the unknown.
  I took a deep breath an stepped off land to sea. The ocean Is the prettiest shades
  of blue I have ever seen. The food on the cruise was delicious the company was great.
  But what I saw when we made it the second day to Mexico was very unexpected. The
  culture was very different from what I'm use to. The people were different from
  what I'm use to the water was crystal clear. The sand was white and beautiful the
  tropical fish you can see right through the water. You can see pyramids from the
  ocean. I've never seen a pyramid except in books growing up. I was so nervous to
  even step off the boat I didn't realize that when I did it was a very different
  temperature. It was mid March winter time in Chicago 15 degrees to 95 degrees was
  a drastic change in temperature. So hot that I couldn't take it. But I did it anyway
  I had to be brave to go into a country that I don't even speak the language. I was
  very worth it if I could travel for the rest of my life to experience every culture
  around the world I would not back down..
