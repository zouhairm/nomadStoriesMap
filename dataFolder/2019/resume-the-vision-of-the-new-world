Text: "Hello there, seems like you're reading my story and I'll try to make this process\
  \ interesting and knowledgable. \nMy name is Ihor and I'm Ukrainian (believe me\
  \ this information is important). Once upon a time I received an interesting idea\
  \ from my acquaintances to look for a job abroad, where I could make more money.\
  \  United Arab Emirates became my target to travel to, 'cause there was one guy\
  \ who I knew. Only now I realize that one person in entire country is not enough\
  \ for me to understand and learn all local rules. As I mentioned I was Ukrainian\
  \ and UAE had totally different culture and mentality...\n\nSo I went there with\
  \ all money I had and actually that move you can call \"All in\" because money was\
  \ not my powerful side. I arrived to Sharjah and spent there 4 days (that was the\
  \ moment which changed my understanding of this country). \nOn the first day I went\
  \ to the closest supermarket to buy some snacks and beer to relax. When I didn't\
  \ find any alcohol at all - I was confused and decided to ask the cashier where\
  \ actually was beer. Her reaction was the same as if I asked \"where can I plant\
  \ the bomb in this building\", she panicked and of course I also started to panic\
  \ (because there was no beer at all in the city). But I put myself together and\
  \ went back to the hotel just to sleep and to go for a walk on the next day.\nNext\
  \ day started as a day when I wanted to see the town Sharjah but instead I was offered\
  \ to go to watch Dubai! Of course I agreed and when we were approaching the city\
  \ I was so shocked that I couldn't speak, it was amazing!! Since I'm from Ukraine,\
  \ the highest building I saw had 25 floors, but now in Dubai, when you see all this\
  \ futuristic architecture - you accidentally decide that it's so wonderful and you\
  \ won't see anything more beautiful. For the first time in Dubai and alone I don't\
  \ know why, but I was not afraid it was for me more like an adventure: a lot of\
  \ new people, new streets, new weather and in the end new culture which I liked\
  \ (but some rules on my opinion are still very strict). Somehow I felt free.\nIn\
  \ the evening me and couple of tourists from our hotel went back to Sharjah and\
  \ Dubai didn't leave my brain...\n\nCouple of rest days staying in the hotel I was\
  \ walking around and giving my CV to different people in different places for different\
  \ vacancies. In the end, The guy who I knew told me to go to Abu Dhabi where he\
  \ lived and I went. It was also gorgeous city (by the way it is the capital of UAE).\
  \ He told me to go to the particular district and my surviving experience started\
  \ when I forgot the name of the district and was working at that moment so he couldn't\
  \ answer the call. I started to look for a place where I could spend at least the\
  \ night and internet didn't help me. I didn't understand the reason why so many\
  \ people rejected me just because I've never faced it before. All those people didn't\
  \ want me to stay with them only because I was not either Indian or Filipino and\
  \ even when I tried to pretend on the phone using different accents I still didn't\
  \ speak their languages and of course they were catching me on it. During the entire\
  \ day till the late night I couldn't find anything, by the end of the evening I\
  \ realized I was alone, my phone battery died, nobody let me in even to sleep and\
  \ leave in the morning. My mind was broken and all hopes left me so Mr Ihor already\
  \ wanted to sleep on a bench in the street, when suddenly the last guy who I talked\
  \ to said that there was one place where I could stay."
