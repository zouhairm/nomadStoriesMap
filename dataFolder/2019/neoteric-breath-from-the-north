Text: "Just after walking through the Karl Johans gate I headed in a search for caffeine\
  \ to keep my curious eyes awake, facing from each side narrow streets with two or\
  \ three whiskey bars, but wasn't time for Ardbeg Supernova scotch, at least for\
  \ me, so I turned left to Radhusgata which lead me to the Caf\xE9 Skansen with outdoor\
  \ seating and jazzy atmosphere even from inside where it looked like library from\
  \ 19th century. I took macchiato which was so mellow served in an antique cup with\
  \ one sugar cube. While sitting outside I noticed men in faded burgundy jacket approaching\
  \ my table. While asking me can he sit on a bench next to me he was parking his\
  \ bicycle, painted in a mix of pink and yellow seemed like really messy sketches\
  \ what some child was drawing for homework. My first thought was \"this is going\
  \ to be strange\" but I surprised myself because I arrived from London where eccentricity\
  \ was an absolutely normal part of our day. He was Christiansen and he was talking\
  \ about himself in the third person with half French and half Norwegian accent.\
  \ In our short conversation, he suggested me to go to see the castle where he met\
  \ his better half. On the one hand, I got a bit pathetic love story, about the way\
  \ how they met each other on small path which leads to castle and they used to spend\
  \ priceless days there, especially in this time of the year, but on the other hand\
  \ I liked it because was the story of a man who is part of this place. It was Oslo\
  \ in October and I was just in a leather jacket, without listening to society to\
  \ take ski equipment because it will be so freezing here on the north. So, I embraced\
  \ my fifty something years old companion and offered him a coffee as gratefulness\
  \ for telling me about this castle Akershus Fortress, which I wasn't able to pronounce.\
  \ He was absolutely right! When I crossed the road next to the Skansen was a garden\
  \ with a path going more up and up and I found myself in front of Akershus castle\
  \ which served as a prison and protection for the capital of Norway with imperial\
  \ guard keeping an eye on it and few tourists which were waving around. One side\
  \ of the castle was all in autumn colors what was obvious in that time of the year\
  \ and more I walked I noticed door of stone which was an entrance and exit to the\
  \ seaside where you had a view on Oslo and harbor. After few hours in nature, I\
  \ went to visit Norwegian National Opera and Ballet which was for me a nice example\
  \ of modern art, at least for me, white and transparent surrounded with the darkness\
  \ of the sea. Coming there from castle seemed like another world, artful world compared\
  \ with the awareness of fresh air on a top of the mountain and actually, you are\
  \ between walls of not defeated castle, so it is not even comparable. Before flight\
  \ back I wanted to see Gustav Vigeland park and I didn't regret that, was something\
  \ that you don't find often, park with sculptures in bronze, granite and cast iron\
  \ which were presenting human interactions. Vigeland park is one of the places where\
  \ you can spend all day and you won't get enough of it, again a fusion of nature\
  \ and art. I didn't know and I still don't know so much about  the history of Oslo\
  \ but I was aware of one sure fact what this city presented to me and it was hierarchy\
  \ between avant-garde and plain nature on the way that you can live urban city life\
  \ but you can still breathe deep in the air and enjoy scent of the sea. On the way\
  \ back to Lufthavn airport I saw graffiti where was written \"We know your capitalistic\
  \ paradise\" and will consider it as a reminder that above all capitalism in which\
  \ we live will stay a chance to take a deep breath on a top of a castle above the\
  \ sea."
