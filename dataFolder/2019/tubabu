Text: "'Dad I'm going to Africa.' It was very clear by the expression on his face\
  \ that it was not what he expected to hear when I told him I needed to speak to\
  \ him, but it was what I had been wanting to do for a long while. The next journey\
  \ on my list, and this time not backpacking; this time trying to live there.\n\n\
  Burkina Faso. I never heard about the country, despite all my knowledge of maps.\
  \ Alto Volta was its name, before becoming a independente nation. When I started\
  \ to research information, it seemed to me the perfect scene to immerge myself into\
  \ for the first time in Africa. There wasn't anything there according to other people.\
  \ That nothingness was everything to me, the reality itself.\_\n\nAfter a long trip\
  \ from Santiago de Chile, Lima, Madrid, Paris, Tripoli, Ouagadougou, i finally arrived,\
  \ late at night. I walked out of the airport and all I could see was ebony colored\
  \ heads. I couldn't find the person who was supposed to be picking me up. After\
  \ a while, my contact arrived with a friend. He took me to a hostel. The driver\
  \ and his friend talked during the journey but I couldn't understand them. However,\
  \ eventually I realized they wanted to go dancing, but i just wanted to go to sleep.\
  \ I woke up the next day in the middle of a noisy\_ and dusty street market. \n\
  They put me up on a motorcycle with all my luggage and took me to the bus station.\
  \ I was outside and it was daytime, there was no doubt, i was in Africa, and finally\
  \ i was able to see wide awake.\_I began to feel my five senses assimilating everything\
  \ around me. Yes! Madness, but incredibly beautiful.\n\nBut my trip was far from\
  \ ending, because i had to arrive to Bobo Dioulasso, the city of the Djemb\xE9,\
  \ Baobabs and the great mosque of clay, that was going to be my city. I was very\
  \ tired, but i coudn't allow myself close the eyes and lose what that six hours\
  \ between one city and other had to offer me. The first images of this big adventure.\_\
  \nIt was very exciting to see Africa in motion from the bus. Is very real and intense.\
  \ Every time I made that journey between my city and the capital, I saw life itself\
  \ pass in front of my eyes. I observed the people who lived by the roadside; their\
  \ silhouettes became lost in the paths of the savannah. The big trees, the red color\
  \ of the earth. Children playing in the cotton piles, people carrying water on their\
  \ heads. Houses made of clay - some of which had collapsed due to\_ the rain in\
  \ monsoon season. People who greeted me on the road. I dont know! so many things,\
  \ for me, the whole of humanity!\n\nThe trip from the capital Ouaga to Bobo, had\
  \ a mandatory stop. Boromo. There I came very close to the elephants that can sometimes\
  \ be seen from the bridge. A stop in the middle of chaos. A market where anything\
  \ can be found. People knew that inside that particular bus there was always a foreigner,\
  \ and they waited anxiously. This opportunity that foreign was me.\n\nThe bus stopped\
  \ for 10 minutes. I decided to stay inside. I noticed the bus was surrounded and\
  \ they stood beside my window, with their sesame seeds, peanuts, fruits, vegetables,\
  \ water and chicken legs, held above their heads. It was very hot inside the bus\
  \ and outside was worse, but to be honest i was trying to avoid to face that moment.\
  \ I heard them call me, ''Tubabu come here!'' I said, it's fine I'm going down.\n\
  \nI was nervous and anxious at the same time. What was I searching for? Why had\
  \ I come here? This purpose needed to be accomplish, starting at certain point.\
  \ That was the moment, the point of no return, the first lonely step here, that\
  \ i did on my own, Outside of that bus, awaiting me, was an unknown world, that\
  \ was completely new to me. And i got myself into it."
