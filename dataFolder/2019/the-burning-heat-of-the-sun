Text: "\u201CWe will reach the shore. We will\u201D, I kept whispering under my breath,\
  \ squeezing my eyes shut. I tried to forget that our little open vessel was plunging\
  \ in the Atlantic Ocean with violent wind all around us. Or that I had no idea how\
  \ to swim.\n\nJust 5 days ago I had arrived to Tenerife for some enjoyable holidays.\
  \ I could feel the blazing heat immediately after stepping out of the plane; the\
  \ weather was perfect for anybody hoping to get a nice golden suntan or go for a\
  \ refreshing swim. But I was looking forward to something else. Afterall, you don\u2019\
  t get to see one of the largest animals on Earth from up-close very often.\n\nGoing\
  \ on a whale watching tour seemed liked a brilliant idea, after a thorough investigation\
  \ online, I decided to book the two-hour-long option. My heart skipped a beat as\
  \ I realised that I would be in the open water for so long. \u201CYou\u2019re not\
  \ scared, you\u2019re excited\u201D, I told myself as I shut down my computer and\
  \ left for a stroll on the beach.\n\nOn the morning of our expedition I was really\
  \ enthusiastic: the weather forecast was for clear skies for the whole day. I could\
  \ feel the uplifting atmosphere as I joined thirty other adventure seekers on the\
  \ deck. \u201CThis is going to be incredible\u201D, a man next to me told his daughter\
  \ just before our vessel sailed away from the dock. \n\nHalf an hour passed, and\
  \ everyone was starting to get disappointed. With no sight of the promised animals,\
  \ we were simply drifting out to the ocean. The guide was trying to keep up the\
  \ spirits by telling some facts about the blue whale, the beaked whale, the false\
  \ killer whale\u2026 It didn\u2019t take me long to realise that something was off.\
  \ The waves were getting higher and higher and the shore wasn\u2019t visible anymore.\
  \ Thick mist was starting to form in a matter of minutes.\n\nI looked around. The\
  \ deck was no longer full of loud conversations or cheerful children shouts, the\
  \ sound of water hitting our boat had become the only thing I could hear. The unsettling\
  \ feeling in my stomach made me sick. I stood up and started taking childishly small\
  \ steps towards the cabin, trying not to fall on my way: I had to find out what\
  \ was happening.\n\nThe look on the captain\u2019s face was enough to make me regret\
  \ getting up from my seat, but it was too late. I stood by the cabin door and waited\
  \ for his answer to my question. \u201CThat fog you see over there\u201D, he shouted\
  \ through the noise, \u201Cthat\u2019s not fog. It\u2019s Simoom, a wind from Sahara.\
  \ We can\u2019t go back to the shore, Simoom\u2019s blocking us from getting closer\
  \ to the land. We\u2019ll have to -\u201D.\n\nBefore I could hear the end of the\
  \ sentence, I felt the surface beneath me shake and was thrown down onto the floor\
  \ of the cabin. The terrified crew was shouting something in Spanish. It struck\
  \ me that if we turn over, I will drown, so I grabbed an old life jacket and stepped\
  \ back to the deck, realising that I might get thrown into the freezing water at\
  \ any second.\n\nTime stopped. I couldn\u2019t think about anything and, for the\
  \ first time in my life, actually realised that someday I\u2019m going to die. It\
  \ wasn\u2019t up to me to decide if I would get another hour of life; all I could\
  \ do was to make the current moment count. I gave myself the promise that if I survived\
  \ to live another day, I would never forget this. The sound of the waves slowly\
  \ took over my thoughts.\n\nI can\u2019t really recall what happened next. I was\
  \ told that the captain managed to keep our boat under control until the wind slowed\
  \ down, then we were finally taken back to the coast. I remember taking my first\
  \ step onto the solid ground: all I wanted to do was fall down on my knees and scream.\
  \ Shaking uncontrollably, I felt the burning heat of the brightly shining sun. It\
  \ was one of the best feelings I\u2019ve ever felt: I was alive."
