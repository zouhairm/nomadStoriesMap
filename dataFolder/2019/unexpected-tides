Text: "My best-friend and I thought that us traveling solo together was the ultimate\
  \ experience, but what awaited us were 3 weeks packed with adventure and nothing\
  \ going as planned. I\u2019d never been to Asia before, so I did not really know\
  \ what to expect, but we were both eager to start our volunteering project and explore\
  \ the rich Chinese culture. After 11 hours in the air, we finally landed in Beijing.\
  \ We were in a vortex of emotions ranging from exhaustion, hunger, and excitement\
  \ with a slight fear of the unknown.\LThe next morning, we were on our way to one\
  \ of the 7 wonders of the world. The only way to get up from the base to the watchtowers\
  \ on the Great Wall \u2014 other than hiking \u2014 is a chairlift, and even my\
  \ uneasiness with heights did not stop me. It was a scary fun ride, but when we\
  \ stepped foot on that mighty wall, all of that ceased to matter. It was such a\
  \ surreal moment, we were enraptured by the dense history this place holds within\
  \ its walls. \nGoing down, we took a luge ride that gave a spectacular view of the\
  \ whole wall. To this day, it\u2019s one of our favorite experiences. \nHours later,\
  \ we took a train to Ningbo. When we arrived, we were greeted with the news that\
  \ the agreed upon accommodation was no longer an option. After various meetings,\
  \ we could not see eye-to-eye and were completely left on our own. \nWe decided\
  \ to explore this unfamiliar city, that is to be our home for the next few weeks.\
  \ As we settled in the city, the humidity was getting unbearable. Being from the\
  \ Middle East, we were not accustomed to 95% humidity and above. So we did what\
  \ the locals did, we bought an umbrella to shelter us from the fierce heat. Moreover,\
  \ \u201CHoney Pomelos\u201D became our signature drink in overcoming the airlessness\
  \ we had to endure. \nSubways became our main mode of transportation, and as such\
  \ we spent most of our time on them. It was incredible seeing people from all walks\
  \ of life sitting next to each other, all taking the subway, all going somewhere.\
  \ \nHaving a different religious background made it interesting to be inside a temple.\
  \ To witness how people pray, give thanks and tokens to whom that they worship.\
  \ And that made me appreciate that even though we follow a different God, we are\
  \ all on a similar spiritual journey. \nOur next destination was the beautiful city,\
  \ Hangzhou. The scenery was breathtaking. The crystal blue water, the green trees,\
  \ the flowers and the peacefulness of it was the reward we needed to end our trip.\
  \ We packed some chips, toast, and honey pomelos, and ate in silence as we tried\
  \ to take it all in, how it all went wrong yet we couldn\u2019t have hoped for a\
  \ better adventure, how we were forced out of our comfort zones every single day,\
  \ how we are not the same people we were 3 weeks ago, and how fulfilling these weeks\
  \ have been. As the sun went down, and the sky was this light shade of pink, a Chinese\
  \ dance class was held in front of the lake, we put down our sandwiches and danced\
  \ away together into the night."
