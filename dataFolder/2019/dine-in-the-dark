Text: "I am a person that is always seeking for learning and exploring, so when I\
  \ came across an information about a dinner served in the dark at a restaurant in\
  \ Bangkok, I had no doubts, I soon managed to fit it in our city itinerary and make\
  \ reservations!\n\nDINE IN THE DARK. The adventure consists of dining in total pitch\
  \ dark, without knowing what is served and all the waiters are visually impaired!\
  \ The restaurant is located at the Sheraton Hotel in Bangkok, on arrival you are\
  \ greeted by the hostess at the bar where she hands you an apron and tells you how\
  \ it works. You can choose from 4 menu options (Asian, Western, Vegetarian or Surprise);\
  \ dinner is served in a 4-course sequence. I was with by my husband and we chose\
  \ the Surprise menu, of course! Adventurers, remember?!\n\nAfter the hostess\u2019\
  \ explanation it's time to head to the door of the restaurant where you are greeted\
  \ and presented to your waiter, Ball was his name. We walked into the darkness of\
  \ the restaurant with our hands on Ball's shoulders, as instructed by him. At first\
  \ we feel panic, go down steps and walk in the dark in a totally unknown place takes\
  \ you out of your comfort zone. Ball set us up at our table and retired to get some\
  \ water. We took the opportunity to recognize the environment with our hands, check\
  \ what was on the table and gradually we were relaxing. Realizing how open we were\
  \ to that experience, Ball always offered us challenges like pouring water into\
  \ the glass and hot soup in the bow by ourselves! We accepted it all and we were\
  \ able to perform the tasks with praise! Everything there is designed in a way that\
  \ makes you explore more of the other senses. The dishes have unusual shapes and\
  \ not simply square or round, some foods are served to be eaten with hands, others\
  \ with cutlery and everything was simply divine! In each course we made sure of\
  \ sliding our hand on the plate to make sure we had left nothing out. I can\u2019\
  t give you details of the menu, it would spoil the surprise!\n\nIn the end, when\
  \ leaving the restaurant and returning to the bar, the hostess shows you photos\
  \ of the dishes that were served. Everything with an impeccable presentation, even\
  \ if it is not possible to appreciate with the vision. With each dinner paid, the\
  \ hotel makes a donation to the Foundation of the Blind in Thailand. Dine in the\
  \ Dark is a unique and enriching experience, I encourage everyone who likes to venture\
  \ into the unknown!"
