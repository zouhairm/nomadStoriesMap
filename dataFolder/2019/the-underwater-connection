Text: "\u201CSunrise is best time to see him,\u201D Wayan said. \u201CYou want wake\
  \ up call?\u201D\n\nEight hours later, a gentle tap on the cabin door. Wayan stands\
  \ with a fresh banana in one hand and snorkelling gear in the other. He hands both\
  \ to me with a toothless smile and points towards a dusty path behind the guesthouse.\n\
  \n\u201CThe north shore,\u201D he says. \u201CBe careful of the collection.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CThe collection?\u201D I repeat, wearily. He nods. \n\nI walk past snoring\
  \ wooden houses guarded by tethered cows with glinting eyes. It is quiet, save for\
  \ the caws of an enthusiastic cockerel. \n\nThe inland path comes to an end and\
  \ I am on the eastern shore. Towering palm trees shelter beachside shacks that,\
  \ from lunchtime, will sell bottles of Bintang to a soundtrack of reggae music.\
  \ \n\nThe collection, I learn, takes place on a Thursday morning. \n\nHundreds of\
  \ black sacks are piled onto the beach, the tide lapping against them. They bulge\
  \ hazardously, as if teetering on the edge of a sneeze, threatening to burst and\
  \ reveal their contents.\n\nI scan the gargantuan amount of waste; the smell is\
  \ pungent and my stomach lurches with a deep sense of helplessness. \n\nI jog past\
  \ the wall of polyethylene and continue north. The beach is uninhabited at this\
  \ time of the day and its empty, seemingly clean sands are the antithesis of the\
  \ eastern shore. I squeeze my toes together, feeling the soft, cool grains beneath\
  \ my feet. I eat the banana that Wayan gave me, leaving the peel alongside my towel\
  \ as I don my snorkel and run into the water. \n\nA bed of dead coral dominates\
  \ the shallows. Bleached branches lie lifelessly on the seabed and after a minute\
  \ of swimming, I start to wonder if Wayan had meant for me to search here. But,\
  \ through the dim orange haze, the white seabed starts to transform into a scatter\
  \ of rocky outcrops and colourful sponges.\n\n\u201CFind the barrel,\u201D Wayan\
  \ had said the night before. \n\nI spot a solitary batfish up ahead. A sea anemone\
  \ dances in the tide, and I glimpse a flash of orange between its tentacles. I dive\
  \ towards it and come face to face with a family of clown fish. A bold male approaches\
  \ my mask with a furrowed brow. From the cerulean of the ocean, I spot a flash of\
  \ olive green. \n\nWayan was right.\n\nThere, cushioned on a giant barrel sponge,\
  \ lies one of the island\u2019s oldest residents. An aged green turtle, its shell\
  \ a hexagonal patchwork of earthy brown. I dive down, my ears popping as I plunge\
  \ deeper under the water. The turtle\u2019s round, black eyes roll lazily towards\
  \ me. \n\n\u201CHe\u2019s nearly as old as me,\u201D I hear Wayan chuckling. \n\n\
  His golden head rests on the edge of the sponge whilst his fleshy underside bobs\
  \ against the coral. A chunk of his left flipper is missing, a spotted edge fringed\
  \ with a white scar. \n\nI rise to catch my breath and the turtle follows. He glides\
  \ to the surface and pokes his face out of the water, taking an audible breath.\
  \ With bubbles drifting from his nostrils, he returns to his sponge. \n\nA hum of\
  \ engines breaks the silence and I swim back to shore, conscious that boats frequently\
  \ cross these waters from all directions. A stream of smoke rises near the eastern\
  \ shore.\n\nA plastic bag floats ahead of me, and I grab it. A few metres beyond\
  \ that, an empty can of Diet Coke. A sack has split and spilled into the shallows.\n\
  \nI reach the beach and throw off my snorkelling gear, returning to the water to\
  \ drag the rubbish out. I forget that dead coral lines the seabed and I cut my toe,\
  \ trailing blood across the sand. \n\nI am startled by a cough behind me. A young\
  \ local boy, cigarette in hand, stares at me blankly.\n\nI heave the waste onto\
  \ the palm-lined path and pick up my banana peel. I go to put it in the broken bag,\
  \ and then I hesitate. \n\n\u201CThey take it over there,\u201D the boy says, kicking\
  \ the bag softly and pointing to the horizon. \u201CBut it always comes back.\u201D"
