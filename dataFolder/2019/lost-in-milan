Text: "4th of March. 2018. One city. Three days. \nI always dreamed about visiting\
  \ Italy, the country whose culture I love the most and the city which I decide on\
  \ to start was Milan, the capital of fashion, where people look amazing even when\
  \ they sleep.\nAfter begging my parents to book my trip, I woke up in the airport,\
  \ at 9 am, eager to meet the culture which I read so much about. It would have been\
  \ my first flight, so I was both anxious because I had to face a three-hour trip\
  \ and also because I would have to deal with the unknown of a new destination, one\
  \ which a dreamed about a lot.\n11 am, Milan, Italy. I was already on the heart\
  \ of the town, dumbfounded by the mastery of this amazing city. The architecture\
  \ which was surrounding me, the people who were rushing to arrive to their destination,\
  \ the tratorias which slam the area, everything made me fell like being lost in\
  \ unknown. But this unknown was a place from where I would never leave!\nI checked\
  \ my phone in order to find the way to my hotel and after thirty minutes I had already\
  \ done my check in. I was greedy to discover all beauties of the city, so I left\
  \ my luggage in the room and, taking my photocamera, I stroked the streets to the\
  \ city centre which made me made me fell in love with Milan from the first sight.\n\
  The loftiness of the Duommo let me without words and at that moment, when I hit\
  \ the build with my view, I knew that this will become my favourite place in the\
  \ word. History, art, cuisine, all things that I was passioned about in the same\
  \ place!\nEven if I felt still lost in it's beauty, I understand that sometimes,\
  \ it's good to be lost if you are in the right place. And for God's name, Milan\
  \ is the right place!\nI go on the Duommo and my breathe was taken. The view was\
  \ absolutely thunder-struckly and I started feeling mused about my chance to be\
  \ there and also to be part of the city story.\nI spent my days there trying all\
  \ savoury flavours of ice cream, pizza, past and the toothsome tiramisu which I\
  \ had been already loving since I was a child.\nAfter I went back home, I started\
  \ feeling incomplete, like a part of my soul was left in Milan, there where the\
  \ stars are shinning over the Duommo and where people smile you and say \"Buongiorno\"\
  , making you fell like being lost in the country of \"La vita e bella\" movie. I\
  \ promised myself to return and spend more time in the city which stole my heart,\
  \ the city which made me understand how good is to fell lost if you are in the right\
  \ place."
