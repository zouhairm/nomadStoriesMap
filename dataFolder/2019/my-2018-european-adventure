Text: "My name is Priscila and I am Brazilian. Two years ago I ended a relationship\
  \ that lasted for eight years. The pain I felt was so great, and so hard to deal\
  \ with that I decided I needed a new adventure. I needed to get away from everything,\
  \ my city, my friends, myself. During a work trip in 2016, I met a Portuguese girl\
  \ who had a flat in Lisbon. She told me she was going away to China for a year.\
  \ \n\nI asked her if I could fly to Europe and stay in her flat, to get away from\
  \ it all. I had never been to Europe before. My roots are Portuguese, so I really\
  \ wanted to know more about this country. I arrived in Lisbon in April, 2018. With\
  \ only a rented apartment and a remote job. No friends. No specific plans. I could\
  \ stay in Europe for 3 months, so I thought, if this didn't work out, I could just\
  \ return to Brazil. I also wanted to see other countries in Europe, but wasn't sure\
  \ if this was going to be possible. \n\nSo I spent my days working and going sightseeing\
  \ and doing volunteer work. One day, when I was volunteering in Lisbon, I met a\
  \ Swedish woman who asked for my phone number. She later texted me and said she\
  \ had a daughter living in Paris. After my period living in Lisbon and going on\
  \ short trips to other countries, I got an extension to stay in Europe and moved\
  \ to Paris in July, to live with her daughter (I rented a room in her apartment).\
  \ I couldn't have imagined any of that when I left Brazil. After staying for two\
  \ months in Paris, I moved to Italy for a month, living with an Italian friend who\
  \ used to live in Brazil. I also had the chance to go to the Netherlands and meet\
  \ my remote work colleagues from the Dutch office for the first time. In total,\
  \ I could visit Portugal, Spain, England, the Netherlands, France and Italy. My\
  \ mother joined me for the final leg of my trip, and I made great friends along\
  \ the way that will (hopefully) become friends for a lifetime.\n\nDuring this whole\
  \ time I took many pictures and saw many places. I also kept a journal to describe\
  \ the turmoil that was going on inside me. Bit by bit, I felt better, I learned\
  \ about the world, about cultures and especially, about myself. It's clich\xE9 to\
  \ say, but yes, when you travel far enough, you meet yourself. When you are deprived\
  \ of everything and everyone that feels \"familiar\", and you need to introduce\
  \ yourself so many times, and deal with other people's (and your own) stereotypes\
  \ and assumptions, you really figure out how you come across and who you are. And\
  \ then, for me, it started to become really easy to identify the people and places\
  \ that were a good match for me. \n\nBad things happened too: immigration officers\
  \ were nasty. My luggage didn't arrive with me in Paris. I had to stay with the\
  \ same clothes/shoes, same everything for two days. My phone was also stolen there\
  \ and I had to talk to my family using only emails until I got another one. I freaked\
  \ out and thought I couldn't do it anymore. But I survived. And each of these challenges\
  \ made me stronger. \n\nI returned to Brazil in November, 2018. The lessons I learned\
  \ stayed with me. And sometimes I look back and can't believe all this happened.\
  \ I felt like I wanted to do this, not only to see the world and learn new things,\
  \ but also to prove to myself that I could do it. And if I could do all that, alone,\
  \ it was not a break up that was going to be the end of me. And it wasn't. And it\
  \ isn't. And I am already planning my next trip :)"
