Text: "Ones upon a time, there was a girl born in a conservative family who was living\
  \ in one of the remote provinces of Afghanistan. She was aware that her destiny\
  \ should be challenging yet beautiful. She was also aware that there are boundaries\
  \ that she needs to cross in order to challenge the old traditions. She had a mother\
  \ who could rarely read/write but yet she was the very first teacher she ever had,\
  \ starting from learning how to write to how to pronounce the Arabic words in order\
  \ to learn how to pray. She had a father who was educated but yet afraid of being\
  \ caught by Taliban because his education was a threat for the extremists who at\
  \ the end had no alternative other than leaving his own beloved country/family behind\
  \ in order to keep himself and his family safe. She had brothers who were not less\
  \ than friends who would do anything for their only sister in order to make her\
  \ happy, simply by just supporting her points of views and believing in her. And\
  \ yes, she has a niece and a nephew who are more than a television at home. Televisions\
  \ are hardly being watched here in Kabul (the capital of Afghanistan) due to lack\
  \ of sufficient electricity but they two never fails to make everyone happy and\
  \ occupied with their childish nature.\nLater on, as life goes on this girl kept\
  \ fighting for her freedom and education and left behind following the old traditions\
  \ and became the very first female member of her community to get a Master\u2019\
  s degree from a country other than her own and to explore life from a different\
  \ perspective. \nOne day, she saw a post that was about travel writing scholarships\
  \ and thought to apply. The reasons behind her application has a long story:  1.\
  \ She is a passionate personal blogger who is eagerly looking to share her views\
  \ through her personal blog which she has created while doing her Bachelors degree\
  \ in the year 2013. However, she found it somewhat hard to work/publish the articles\
  \ she found interesting for herself \u2013 the cases of corruption, the theme behind\
  \ women rights and children rights, the family concerns, and so on. 2. She is looking\
  \ to expand her photography skills and to show the world the good sides of the people\
  \ and places. 3. The title of my article is chosen \u2018The journey from Afghanistan\
  \ to Europe\u2019 because I wanted to link a personal story of a girl, living in\
  \ a less privileged country with a minority background to a girl who never gives\
  \ up in achieving her dreams, the dreams of living free with no social, political,\
  \ and economical pressures.\nLast but not the least, she is looking forward to grabbing\
  \ an opportunity that facilitates her to explore the world and bring up the positivity\
  \ and hope regardless of how small or big her efforts are, yet she will keep continuing\
  \ her journey the way she wants as a human being."
