Text: "Dead of winter, not wanting to roll out of bed, beautiful music is calling\
  \ to my heart and soul, 212 miles away in Idaho Falls, Idaho.\n\nAlthough this road\
  \ trip has been in the planning for several months, waking up late, procrastination\
  \ has finally caught up with us, leading to expeditiously throwing two days\u2019\
  \ worth of clothes and essentials into a backpack, drinking Chai Tea and eating\
  \ granola bars while rushing out the door. \n\nCrisp air, blue skies, sunshine and\
  \ dry roads are greatly appreciated as our Ford Taurus travels at top speed. The\
  \ necessity to fill up 90 minutes into our journey is imminent, as driving on fumes\
  \ is not an option. Being stuck on the road out in the middle of nowhere is not\
  \ the purpose. No matter what obstacles we face, we will arrive safely and on time.\n\
  \nPulling into one of only two gas stations in the entire town to fuel up, it is\
  \ decided that it is in our best interest to get a late lunch while here, as vegan\
  \ dining options in Idaho Falls are unknown and possibly very limited, and time\
  \ is definitely of the essence.\n\nTwangy country music plays as we enter and the\
  \ sole employee takes our order. Sitting inside the Subway sandwich shop in Malad,\
  \ Idaho, halfway through the meal, who should walk in but Howard Jones, his manager,\
  \ and guitar player! The employee has no clue as to who they are. I spot them immediately,\
  \ and nearly choking on my sandwich in utter disbelief, Howard sees me and exclaims,\
  \ \u201CJenn!!! If you\u2019re eating here, so can I!!!\u201D (He\u2019s vegan too).\
  \ They all come over and sit with us and tell their story about how they came to\
  \ be in the same place at the same time in the middle of nowhere. \n\nTheir connecting\
  \ flight from SLC to Idaho Falls is canceled. David, Howard\u2019s manager, proclaims\
  \ in his very British accent, \u201CCanceled! It can\u2019t be canceled! We have\
  \ a show to do!!!\u201D There is no logical reason for all flights into Idaho Falls\
  \ to be canceled. The only option for them now is \u201Cto hire a van\u2026and drive\
  \ 3 hours\u201D, only to find themselves at the very same Subway shop as us along\
  \ the way. What are the chances of that happening, to have your all time favorite\
  \ musician cross paths with you in the most random place in the world? (It happens\
  \ considerably more than one realizes, especially for me-I possess The Rock Star\
  \ Law Of Attraction\u2026That\u2019s another story though\u2026)\n\nAfter warm welcoming\
  \ hugs, they walk up to the counter, Howard turns around, and motions me to come\
  \ up. \u201CJenn, what did you get on your sandwich?\u201D I tell him, and he orders\
  \ the exact same sandwich as I have. Apparently, Subway is his Go-To. They are everywhere\
  \ in the world and offer at least a couple of vegan options, even if they are options\
  \ that aren\u2019t particularly exciting. They provide subsistence, and sometimes\
  \ that\u2019s all you need for the time being. We all finish our meals and conclude\
  \ our inspirational conversations and go our separate ways, even though the final\
  \ destination is the same-we are attending his show in Idaho Falls later in the\
  \ evening.  \n\nWe arrive safely in Idaho Falls and Howard\u2019s performance is\
  \ phenomenal, especially from the front row! Having to wait a month after tickets\
  \ went on sale for Season Pass Holders, it was definitely not expected for me to\
  \ score front row tickets as a member of the general public, but it was meant to\
  \ be! The Universe knows that is where I need to be and it answered my call. It\
  \ is not just a recommendation, it is a requirement. \n\nLooking around, the average\
  \ age of this particular audience is about 76, not his usual fan base, but Howard\u2019\
  s music crosses all borders and everyone can enjoy it. At the end of the concert\
  \ as I am exiting, an elderly couple is talking, and overhear the exuberant commentary\
  \ , \u201CThat was even better than The Mikado!\u201D It made me smile!\n\nIn the\
  \ end, you never know what to expect; just embrace all the experiences and opportunities\
  \ that present themselves for the most magical moments!"
