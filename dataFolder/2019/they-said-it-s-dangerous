Text: Freedom gives you options, you can choose what you want to experience. I started
  trekking a lot with my friends and each time I loved it more. One day my friend
  showed me beautiful pictures of frozen waterfall which was in Leh. We decided to
  go on Chadar trek. I knew nothing about the Trek I was very excited. When there
  was just two months for the trek I started preparing . I googled a lot of things
  about Chadar which terrified me. I was very scared. My friend cancelled it because
  she had asthma. I was determined to go but I was scared. I reached Leh to meet my
  newself and I did. I learnt I could go through hardship. Walking on the slipperery
  ice, bearing subzero temperatures (-26 to -33) , feeling breathless became a routine.
  I made so many new friends on my solo trek to Chadar. Moreover I was myself with
  13 unknown. Our daily task was to walk 10-15km on small hills, broken ice, snow,
  freezing cold water. I enjoyed my journey I never felt I was wrong going for the
  trek alone. Those majastic mountains, humble people of Leh, 13 unknown friends like
  my own and last but not the least,  steaming hot mutton momos made me fall deep
  in love for the mountains. I had finally completed my 5 days trek on frozen Zanskar
  river. I came back stronger than I thought I was.
