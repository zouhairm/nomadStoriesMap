Text: "\u201CHey, there\u2019s a photo in here!\u201D \n\nDiego\u2019s voice snaps\
  \ me out of my cheese omelette induced reverie, bringing my attention to the papers\
  \ he\u2019s just pulled out of a book. We glance at the photo of a Tibetan man and\
  \ woman smiling side by side, but our attention is almost immediately diverted by\
  \ the envelope next to it. He slides out the letter inside it, and we begin reading\
  \ it together. \n\nMcLeod Ganj, a tiny suburb of Dharamshala, is nestled into the\
  \ mountains of Himachal Pradesh in India. Once a favorite retreat of the British\
  \ rulers, it now plays host to cedar trees, stunning views of snow-capped peaks,\
  \ colorful buildings - and the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader of Tibet. Since 1959,\
  \ the spiritual leader of the Buddhist nation has lived here, creating a shadow\
  \ government under the protection of India, and presiding over what has come to\
  \ be known as the mini-Tibet of the country.\n \nDown one of the smaller lanes lies\
  \ His Holiness\u2019 temple and residence. Featuring paintings, carvings and statues\
  \ in the Buddhist style, the temple is populated by a mixture of pilgrims and tourists\
  \ turning the ubiquitous prayer wheels, all whilst surrounded by red and yellow\
  \ robed\nmonks. On our visit there, I was struck by the repetition of one facet\
  \ of the art - the mandala. Often used as a representation for the cosmos or the\
  \ universe, it also signifies the impermanence of beauty, a concept that at the\
  \ time powerfully resonated.\n\nConnections made while traveling are ephemeral,\
  \ yet extraordinary. A shy, reserved person by nature, I could not have predicted\
  \ the number of friends I would have made when I embarked on my first trip - nor\
  \ how those fleeting relationships would stay with me. \n\nTraveling up the mountains,\
  \ I had a childhood wish in mind - to see snow for the first time. Upon reaching,\
  \ I discovered the last snowfall had just melted, and the next was not expected\
  \ for at least a week - long after I would leave. \n\nI had almost resolved to leave\
  \ town and make my way back to Delhi, when a tumultuous roar of noise tumbled into\
  \ my hostel room and within 10 minutes, I found myself packed and ready to trek\
  \ up to the hamlet of Dharamkot with a group of 6 other people; all solo travelers\
  \ who had found each other in the hostel. When we reached there, we found it equally\
  \ dry, and discovered that every hostel there had run out of water due to a burst\
  \ pipe. It seemed destined to be a terrible night.\n\nThat\u2019s what we thought\
  \ until we checked into one of the few open hostels. My memories of that night primarily\
  \ consist of listening to music in the flickering electricity, gorging on copious\
  \ amounts of hot chocolate and Maggi (a popular ramen in India), dancing the night\
  \ away, and yes - rushing out at 12 am, shoeless and giddy, right into the fresh\
  \ snow.\n\nThe next morning, we made our way back down, gorged ourselves silly on\
  \ momos (Tibetan dumplings), trekked up to waterfalls, and finally, drank hot tea\
  \ in the pouring rain. The next few days would bring more cafes, a talk about death\
  \ and the loss of a parent with Aaliya, discussions about life, love and politics\
  \ with Jairam, and finally, the entrance of an American boy who stole my heart for\
  \ a day, and who sat across from me now, eyes tracing the words on the paper. \n\
  \nWhen we finish reading the letter, my heart aches. It details that experience\
  \ we all hope never to go through - a friendship gone stale, two people drifting\
  \ apart for no reason, and finally - goodbye. It was clearly a relationship deeply\
  \ cherished. Neither of us have any idea how it found itself in a book in Yak Cafe.\
  \ Diego gently inserts it back into the envelope and sets it aside. We pay our bill\
  \ and depart. \n\nPerhaps the letter writer already knew what it took me travelling\
  \ to the other end of the country to learn - a relationship is a beautiful thing,\
  \ no matter how long it lasts, and even after its end."
