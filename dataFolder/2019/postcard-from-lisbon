Text: "Like many visitors, I too had come to the Tejo bar by word of mouth. It would\
  \ have been enough to meet some musician or talk to some artists or simply ask the\
  \ \"right\" person how the evening should be ended, and then you could have had\
  \ the chance to be accompanied in this private studio in the heart of Alfama, the\
  \ Moorish quarter of Lisbon. On the Tejo Bar, everybody shared a specific behavioural\
  \ code.  First of all, you had to knock on the door, waiting for Joao to examine\
  \ you and decide if you could enter and finally you could sit in silence. The criterion\
  \ was: no more than 30 people, do not clap, stay there to have fun with everyone.\
  \ So the landlord Man\xE8 could decide whether to read a poem, recite a piece, play\
  \ music or sing. The guests had to actively participate in each show by reading,\
  \ playing or singing, even in their own language. It was nice to listen to the sounds,\
  \ to be patient without necessarily perceiving, because the created atmosphere was\
  \ always of understanding beyond meanings. The setting was small and informal: tables\
  \ with chess, a bar with a few drinks and graffiti on the walls. The people who\
  \ came were mainly musicians who ended their evening there after their concerts;\
  \ many foreigners and someone from the neighbourhood. I liked to go late at night,\
  \ just because I knew I would meet someone, I would learn some new poetry and I\
  \ would sing. Every night I was impatient to know what it could happen because I\
  \ felt that all cultural diversity led to mutual enrichment. I lived in Lisbon in\
  \ 2005 because I went there on Erasmus and I tried to present myself in all possible\
  \ situations. Why did I choose this destination, I really did not know it at the\
  \ time; maybe it was just for a book that I had read set in Portugal, which has\
  \ given me a poetic melancholy linked to the past. it could have been a film that\
  \ portrayed Portugal from a romantic and timeless point of view. However, as the\
  \ Fado says (traditional Portuguese music), the emotional part is already written\
  \ while the exploration's one has yet to be discovered. My first impression of Lisbon\
  \ was that of a bright and decadent city, exactly as I had idealized it; Moorish\
  \ colours on the facades of the houses smells of embers on the street and life in\
  \ the dark alleys that characterize it. One breathes a \"Saudade\", (nostalgia),\
  \ that echoes in the memory of a maritime past of a dictatorship, ended in 1975,\
  \ and of the rebirth in a composed and silent way. I lived an intimacy with this\
  \ culture that I had no way of living with my Italian one and I breathed the present\
  \ similar to the past that my parents told me. I did not believe I had a nature\
  \ linked to that apparent calm; indeed, the surprise was the discovery of a disquiet\
  \ behind that tranquillity. The Tejo bar represented a synthesis of all this: clandestine,\
  \ intimate and restless and all those who attended it had these characteristics.\
  \ The reality of the Tejo bar had to be told, it is a simple reality, made of repeated\
  \ gestures, musical rituals and moments of poetry, all expertly managed by Mr Man\xE8\
  , who no longer exists and has given way to new urban settlement."
