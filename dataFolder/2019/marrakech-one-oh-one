Text: "It\u2019s strange to think that one can hop on a plane in Dublin and less than\
  \ 4 hours later (providing you can meet Ryanair\u2019s numerous and oftentimes mind-boggling\
  \ guidelines) touch down in a place that is as different from home as chalk is from\
  \ cheese, as Christmas is from Easter, as Ozzy is from Britney. \n\tMarrakech, Morocco,\
  \ on the tippy-top hairline of Africa. \n\tStepping out of arrivals in Marrakech\
  \ is like stepping into another world, to coin a rather stale phrase. Gone are the\
  \ square-box, pebbled-dashed buildings, replaced by ochre structures with curious\
  \ peepholes dotted across their faces that made me itch to enact my own version\
  \ of Assassin\u2019s Creed.\n\tThe vegetation of home, although incomparable with\
  \ most countries, still finds a worthy rival in Marrakech\u2019s thick and laden\
  \ orange trees, fountain palms, and tall trunks of nothing that suddenly umbrella\
  \ out at the top above everything.\n\tThere is no inch of space that isn\u2019t\
  \ decorated by tiles, tracery or ornament. Colour, colour, everywhere. The smells\
  \ \u2013 incense, rotting oranges, spices. And beware the population of stray cats\
  \ that pull without mercy on your heartstrings. The place truly is an assault on\
  \ the senses. For a girl who considers herself \u2018of the word\u2019 Marrakech\
  \ certainly wasted no time in shutting me up. My people-watching tendencies went\
  \ into overdrive however, sometimes to an embarrassing degree for my companion;\
  \ it is tough enough to get by in a country so foreign without having to travel\
  \ alongside someone who consists of nothing but gawping eyes and gaping mouth. \n\
  \tOf course one cannot visit Marrakech without braving Jemaa el Fna \u2013 the mother,\
  \ father and extended family of all markets. I\u2019d heard many horror stories\
  \ about such places and the hassle a single woman would get from the vendors, so\
  \ I was expecting my day to be a challenge not unlike reaching the bar in a nightclub,\
  \ ungroped, five minutes before closing time.\n\tI soon, however, developed a failsafe\
  \ method of survival involving dropping my eyes and plunging onwards. Me, I\u2019\
  m more accustomed to grinning at anyone who passes my way, sometimes to the extent\
  \ that it sends little old ladies skittering in the opposite direction with their\
  \ tails between their legs. So this tactic was no mean feat for me.\nThe more calls\
  \ and comments that were thrown my way, the harder that giggle inside would boil\
  \ up; it was inevitable that it would eventually spill over. It was always well\
  \ received when it did however. In fact, on one occassion my companion was offered\
  \ 4,000 dirham to relieve himself of me. \n\tAlthough this would be considered quite\
  \ a pot of nectar in a poverty stricken area such as the one we were mired in at\
  \ the time, nonetheless, I was a little stung that there wasn\u2019t at least one\
  \ camel thrown into the dowry. \nI wisely deduced though, that on this occasion\
  \ in Marrakech, haggling wouldn\u2019t be in my best interest. Best instead, to\
  \ accept the offer as compliment and keep plunging."
