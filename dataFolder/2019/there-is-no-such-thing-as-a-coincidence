Text: "\u201CWhy don\u2019t we go to the fire?\u201D\n\n\u201CSure\u201D\n\nMarshmallows\
  \ are roasting over an open bonfire and I\u2019m very curious to enjoy this American\
  \ culinary experience. We are ice-skating in Canada and fresh snow is as far as\
  \ the eye can see. Despite the beauty, I\u2019m literally freezing. We chose to\
  \ spend our Christmas here mostly for two reasons: first, we want a white winter\
  \ wonderland; second, we couldn\u2019t decide with which family to be, therefore\
  \ when someone asks us, \u201CWhy have you decided for Edmonton? Do you have family\
  \ here?\u201D \n\nWe like to joke and answer, \u201CNo, but that\u2019s exactly\
  \ why we are here!\u201D. \n\nA heterogeneous group is chatting and laughing around\
  \ the fire: is made of every age and multiple ethnicities. People skate in and out\
  \ as a jovial and rather plumpy man is distributing roasted candies amongst cheerful\
  \ children. We ourselves are warming up those two icicles we now must call hands.\
  \ My better half and I fraternise with a friendly French Canadian man, his name\u2019\
  s Mike. Mike, who\u2019s a volcano of enthusiasm, is keen to share anything and\
  \ everything with us. I come understand even more why everybody seems to share an\
  \ admirable attitude of kindness and gratitude: their life mission is to spread\
  \ in the world, or better in their neighbourhoods, the word of the Lord. They are\
  \ all Jehovah\u2019s witnesses. When Mike asked us where we are from, he seems to\
  \ find me much more exotic than my American boyfriend. Moreover, as a lots of other\
  \ North Americans, he is fascinated with that Old World from where his ancestors\
  \ left with the purpose to look for a new, better life. He doesn\u2019t apparently\
  \ share any Italian genes because both his great-grandparents were from France,\
  \ but his wife does. I explain him that I was born in a town close to Venice. \n\
  \n\u201CThat\u2019s more or less where the father of my wife was from! The name\
  \ of the town is Ma-Me-Na, darn, I don\u2019t remember, but it ends with sul Piave\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201COh, that\u2019s curious, it sounds like the same town where my mom is\
  \ from. Could be Maserada sul Piave?\u201D \n\n\u201CNot sure, but it sounds alike.\
  \ Let me call her. Cristina, Cristina!\u201D \n\nA blonde is gracefully skating\
  \ towards us. \n\n\u201CHer surname is Zuliani\u201D \n\nI\u2019m speechless. I\
  \ couldn\u2019t help myself, but only blush, because of my wonder. \n\n\u201CThat\u2019\
  s also the same surname of my mum!\u201D\n\nYet the marvel is on everybody\u2019\
  s face but Cristina, who wasn\u2019t there to listen the full story. She offers\
  \ us some tasty hot chocolate. Once we explained ourselves to her, she turns to\
  \ me for a warmhearted hug and she calls me her cousin. With all our differences,\
  \ we are a family. In reality, we still don\u2019t have a specific idea of our degree\
  \ of kinship, but thanks to some research and few calls, we will discover that we\
  \ are even closer than what we thought that night in front of the flames. We know\
  \ now that our Great-Grand parents were brothers and they were living in an ancient\
  \ brick house that is today the restaurant where my uncle works as a chef. When\
  \ few days later we missed our flight due to a grumpy officer at the airport who\
  \ judges me as not eligible to enter in the United States, we called them, asking\
  \ for hospitality. My unfortunate case, which is only one of the millions out there,\
  \ sad result of strictly and blind law regulations of the immigration, is turning\
  \ into something positive. It gives me the chance to get to know and appreciate\
  \ my new relatives, which turned to be fantastic people. To me and my boyfriend,\
  \ it fells like the universe was planning to make fun of us for our Christmas joke;\
  \ no matters how fast you can run from your family at holidays, you will end up\
  \ to celebrate with them. It turns out that Cristina\u2019s father escaped his beloved\
  \ country because he refused to join the army. His disgust for blood and his respect\
  \ for peace drove him to cross an ocean and to land in a new continent. But somehow,\
  \ blood revealed to be thicker than water."
