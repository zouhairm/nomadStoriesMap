Text: "On a cold December night, on my birthday, I made the decision. I booked a two\
  \ month stay in Thailand, all on my own. \nI never did anything this wild, but I\
  \ knew I had to. It\u2019s my life, I can\u2019t wait after others or listen to\
  \ others thinking they know what\u2019s best for me. It has been my dream to go\
  \ to Asia as I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the culture and food. \nI said\
  \ my goodbyes to my friends and family, I knew it was for real once I was dropped\
  \ off at the airport and there were tears falling down my mother\u2019s eyes.\n\
  It\u2019s ok I told her, I\u2019m going to the country of smiles. And it was exactly\
  \ that! A population so filled with that thrill of life, enjoying the beauty of\
  \ everything, immersed in culture and great authentic and creative food. \nMy first\
  \ week I was getting settled into my condo and learning my whereabouts. \nIs this\
  \ a dream? Did I just travel 25 hours away from home and have to look after myself,\
  \ feed myself, and start something new all from scratch?\nOddly enough, people would\
  \ think that I would be afraid or fee vulnerable but no, for what reason?\nGod was\
  \ with me every step I took. \nI knew I\u2019d stay protected and that there\u2019\
  s nothing I should worry about as long as I have faith. \nI started then exploring\
  \ the city of Bangkok more in depth, getting lost in translation, living my life\
  \ as if I were living it here in Montreal. \nI booked some gigs, took some beautiful\
  \ images of people and the scenery, hopped on a tuk tuk, learned some basic Thai\
  \ and ordered the coolest and yummiest street food there was. I mean, who in the\
  \ world pays 1$ for a wholesome meal? Someone in Thailand that is!\nI got to meet\
  \ some interesting people along the way, enjoying night outs in the crazy Khao San\
  \ Road, listening to Ed Sheeran as he was very popular to the locals but then it\
  \ would switch up to ganster rap music real quick!\nI even got to eat fried larvae\
  \ as it\u2019s considered as a delicacy and let me tell you, it tasted just like\
  \ French fries but seasoned with some spices which were great!\nEnough about the\
  \ city though, did I explore the beaches?\nWell of course I did! I wouldn\u2019\
  t go all the way to Thailand and not explore Phuket a bit? I got to ride a scooter\
  \ all around the island and be on a quest to find the perfect beach. I found quite\
  \ a few, and snorkelled as well despite me being burnt from the first day as I fell\
  \ asleep on the beach...\nBut that\u2019s just a little detail I couldn\u2019t let\
  \ hinder my stay on the island. \nDid I mention me getting myself out of a situation\
  \ with cops trying to get a big amount of money from me for visiting a private beach?\
  \ Thank God I talked my way out of it and played like the typical dumb tourist not\
  \ knowing what\u2019s going on hehe! I actually left there laying a couple of bucks\
  \ instead of a couple thousands!\nFrom parties to giant malls, to amazing street\
  \ stands, to long walks around the city, almost having my camera completely run\
  \ over by a truck, to figuring out how to use the laundry machine or to missing\
  \ my departure flight back home...\nI had such an amazing time and wouldn\u2019\
  t change it for the world because it taught me a huge lesson. \nAt the end of the\
  \ day, you have to first be good with yourself and take a leap of faith. Stuff may\
  \ go wrong, you just continue and look forward and know that everything is here\
  \ today and gone tomorrow. \nLive your dreams,\nNever say never,\nDo what you love,\n\
  And live for yourself. \nSee you on my next adventures!"
