Text: "Last year, my best-friend and I traveled to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. We\
  \ spent the final days of our trip in Sintra, a resort town in the foothills of\
  \ Portugal\u2019s Sintra Mountains. Most notably, it is the location of the 19th-century\
  \ hilltop Pena Palace. Upon arrival in the enchanting town, I began documenting\
  \ my experiences. I think it is most effective if I share a journal entry I wrote\
  \ the day I arrived in Sintra. \n\n\u201CI can\u2019t believe I am finally in Sintra.\
  \ All of my pre-Portugal thoughts revolved around the warm yellow and orange tones\
  \ of the Pena Palace. Something about this castle reminisced with me - even before\
  \ I visited it.\n\nWe arrived in Sintra later in the day - exhausted from travelling\
  \ by plane, metro, and train (multiple times and with heavy luggages), I resurfaced\
  \ the little bit of inner strength I had left to conquer the steep slopes that were\
  \ the Sintra mountains. Immediately awe-struck by the warm energy and tones that\
  \ encompass the city, my soul seemed to regain the little pieces of happiness that\
  \ were lost throughout earlier portions of this trip.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t even reached\
  \ the Pena Palace yet and I had already acknowledged that my soul was in pure bliss.\
  \ The tapestry of bright colours illuminated from the castle. The winding path to\
  \ the castle was filled with enchanting gardens and exotic trees. We stood at the\
  \ top of the Palace, overlooking the picturesque city that was blanketed in a lilac\
  \ foggy haze. The castle itself was filled with a strong and contagious energy.\
  \ I felt comfortable and connected at the Palace. I became harmonious with the energies\
  \ around me. I find it difficult to describe my feelings in humanly words. My awareness\
  \ of time and space completely vanished. I was having major d\xE9j\xE0 vu. My connection\
  \ was so deep. Even though I had never been to Sintra before, I felt like I had.\
  \ In this moment, I was one with the universe. I felt as if my soul had finally\
  \ regained access to a multi-dimensional plane. I had exited this dimension and\
  \ was floating in a site of absolute and endless love, happiness and ease.\u201D"
