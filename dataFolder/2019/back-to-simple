Text: ''''' Paradise is here. ''''

  You can create some expectations upon being received with that phrase. At least
  it causes a sensation that had been uncommon in the last months of that year: enthusiasm.
  They had been overshadowed by individual questions about decisions, life and it''s
  course.


  Much was said about paradisiacal beaches, enchanting landscapes and a certain agitation
  at night.

  After meeting hours on a winding and tiring road, to be greeted by such a precise
  phrase, accompanied by dunes that carried a sample of what awaited us - wild and
  charming - was at least ecstatic. But, this is precisely the most special feature
  of the place: isolation.


  A village-shaped work of art, the result of years being handled by villagers, people
  who contribute to it''s growth.


  The simplicity of everything contrasts with the modern world, which also had its
  effects there. The banana leaves that cover the roofs of the villas capture much
  more attention than the luxurious hotel built close to the beach. On a walk at night,
  you can feel the sand on your feet, this one that makes up all the streets of the
  village and be illuminated by the light of the stars, since electric power is only
  more in the center, where are located restaurants.

  In the streets and establishments,you can hear people from all over the world who
  fell in love with the place and became annual goers.


  That place, the people and the glaring simplicity of each thing brought my attention
  back to the little details that I have lost around me and inside me.'
