Text: Moving to a new place for the first time was a big step for me, it was the year
  of 2015 when I completed my graduation and had to go somewhere to complete my masters.
  When I first went to Kolkata, I was quite nervous as the language was a bit unfamiliar
  and no one would speak in the language which is known to me. I hated the place for
  sometime to be honest but I eventually start to like it. I made new friends and
  got to know new people and it was quite an experience for me. From eating the famous
  street foods to celebrating their festivals, I enjoyed each and every moment when
  I was there learning new things from anyone I met. I learnt traveling alone in the
  speed driving buses in Kolkata to talk to unknown people and most important, I almost
  learnt their language in the two years that I stayed there. It's been 2 years since
  I last visited the place. From seeing the ghats of the different mandirs to visiting
  the churchs and the old buildings built by the British during the time of post independent
  India. I must say, that it took me  two years to visit the places Evenugh, it was
  not exactly a travel but a place which made me believe that there can also be a
  home other than your own home. And I can't wait to visit the place which is also
  known as "the city of joy".
