Text: "We were just going for frozen yogurt. It had been so hot the past couple days,\
  \ we were in need of something frosty. As we ate it, we walked along the river.\
  \ The sun had just set, and the lights glittered over the horizon. It was something\
  \ of a magical feeling. As we made our way down the stretch, we passed many kinds\
  \ of people. But there was this one man who caught my eye. He stood close to the\
  \ rivers edge, out of the way of the bustling pedestrians. He had a guitar that\
  \ he strummed like it was the most natural thing in the world. I stopped walking\
  \ and began to listen. Billy Joel, Piano Man; my favorite song. I listened to the\
  \ sweet tune as it filled the air and I looked at the world around me. It was very\
  \ different from my small town living, but I was never so comfortable. Lights filled\
  \ the sky, conversations in every language filled my ears, my song tying the scene\
  \ all together. I felt like this was \u201Cnormal,\u201D I wasn\u2019t a tourist\
  \ anymore. Tears welled in my eyes; this may have been someone else\u2019s everyday,\
  \ but for me, this was beautiful, this was living."
