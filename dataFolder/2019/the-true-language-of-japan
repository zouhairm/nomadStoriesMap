Text: "I noticed the small boy, standing all alone. \n\nWith pale skin and jet black\
  \ hair in a bowl cut, his glasses sat awkwardly on his round face. An oversized\
  \ backpack threatened to tip over his bony frame. Any wind would surely snap him\
  \ in an instant. He looked 5 years old, maximum. \n\nI instinctively scanned the\
  \ crowds of people rushing past me. A sea of black heads spanned the entire length\
  \ of the clean, grey platform. My ears rang with the echo of various melodies that\
  \ indicated the departure and arrival of particular Shinkansen\u2019s, the bullet\
  \ trains in Japan. I am surrounded by sharply dressed business men clutching brief\
  \ cases, and perfectly elegant Japanese women, many with their heads buried in their\
  \ smart phones. \n\nYet none of them belong to this little boy. \n\nThe professional\
  \ social worker in me is ruffled. \n\nI cautiously approach. \n\nIn limited Japanese\
  \ I attempt a conversation. \n\n\u201CExcuse me?\u201D\n\nSlowly, the boy looks\
  \ up from his small video game to peer at my face.\n\n\u201CWhere is your mother\
  \ or your father?\u201D I draw out each syllable, hoping he understands my broken\
  \ Japanese. \n\nHis studious eyes study my face thoughtfully.\n\n\u201CThey are\u2026\
  at home\u201D. \n\nHis answer is short and hesitant. \n\n\u201CIs there anyone here\
  \ with you?\u201D \n\nThere is a long pause. \n\n\u201CNo\u201D. He shakes his head.\
  \ \n\nMy eyes are darting around now. At any moment I expect a responsible or caring\
  \ adult to appear and claim him. \n\nBending down, I stare intently into his dark\
  \ brown eyes, and whisper softly \u201CAre you ok?\u201D As I do this I see the\
  \ reflection in his spectacles. She has long brown hair and a worried expression.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHai!\". (Yes!!) The answer was so sharp it stabbed me in the stomach.\
  \ \n\nAs I am reeling from this injury, a familiar melody marks the arrival of our\
  \ train. Lining up to ride the crowded train, the little boy quickly and artfully\
  \ evaporates into the crowd. Not two minutes later I see him for the last time,\
  \ light reflecting on the edge of his glasses, as he stares at me suspiciously \u2013\
  \ from the other end of the platform. \n\nOn the train back to Kobe question marks\
  \ buzz around and knock on the walls of my skull. Why did no one seem to notice\
  \ or care? Is that normal? Was he lost? Could the little boy actually be \u2013\
  \ safe? \n\nGazing out the clear glass window, I see countless grey monochrome skyscrapers,\
  \ looming in their certainty. There are expertly crafted ancient temples, specific\
  \ in their design, precisely shaped shrines and dazzling rivers. All of the bakery\u2019\
  s display vivid pictures of sumptuous foods, along with meticulously gift wrapped\
  \ pastries to carry home. The taxis have fresh, perfectly laundered seat covers,\
  \ complete with automatic doors that pop open when approached. The convenience stores\
  \ are everywhere, containing every single thing you could wish, hope for, or even\
  \ imagine. \n\nAnd this is when I notice that outside of nearly every convenience\
  \ store, are dozens of bicycles. Neatly parked row upon row, some bike\u2019s have\
  \ groceries still in the back, and other\u2019s display coats or even bags dangling\
  \ lazily from handlebars. They are all unlocked.\n\nArriving at Sumiyoshi train\
  \ station, and looking back and forth from sign to ticket, I realise I have the\
  \ wrong train pass. Loitering at the steel gates I wonder if I should address this,\
  \ after all, my temporary home is only a street away. I choose to carry on, pushing\
  \ my way through. As I do this, a uniformed transport official suddenly appears\
  \ by my side. I brace myself for the conversation. Surprisingly, I am immediately\
  \ helped through the gates by the smiley and pleasant Japanese man - who doesn\u2019\
  t even glance at my ticket. \n\nOn the short stroll home I pass another convenience\
  \ store whilst mulling over the day\u2019s events. There are no sounds of horns\
  \ blaring or road rage, and things run ever so smoothly, in this high tech, modern\
  \ land. \n\nAnd then it hits me. \n\nHonesty and trust are the key ingredients that\
  \ shape Japan - the perfect fusion of a high tech society mixed with old school\
  \ values. \n\nThis is the real unspoken language I have yet to learn."
