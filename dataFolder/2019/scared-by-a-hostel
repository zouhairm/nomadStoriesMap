Text: "In Brazil, S\xE3o Paulo is the largest city and the economic center of South\
  \ America, so it\u2019s expected to find there uncountable buildings, a lot of traffic\
  \ and people locked in the offices dealing with a variety of business problems.\
  \ It might be really stressful, even for a calm and easy going biology student like\
  \ me. A couple of months ago, I was invited to an environment congress to discuss\
  \ new ideas for the urban architecture of certain areas of the city. The event organizer\
  \ suggested us to stay at least for two days, and the students who lived in other\
  \ cities were allocated in a hostel near the theatre where the meetings were happening.\
  \ \nNowadays, I do not travel as much as I would like to, but when I can afford\
  \ a small trip, I\u2019d rather stay in a hotel or I rent an apartment. I had never\
  \ been in a hostel before this Congress, so the experience of sharing accommodations\
  \ with strangers was totally new for me.   \nMy lifestyle is not typical for a young\
  \ lady grown up in the countryside. To prove that, when I finished school, I decided\
  \ to go to another city for college, and I did not get married as my parents hoped\
  \ so, even if my boyfriend keeps proposing me. Also, I\u2019ve got five tattoos\
  \ and changed dramatically my hair. \nEventually, despite all these peculiarities,\
  \ I\u2019m still a bit shy and couldn\u2019t make friends easily until the environment\
  \ congress. When I was told that my room at the hostel would be shared by five girls\
  \ who I had never met before, my first thought was that it would turn into a complete\
  \ mess. The idea of how we would manage to use the only bathroom on our floor with\
  \ the boys in the bedroom in front of us worried me very much. For my relief, at\
  \ first, the owners provided breakfast and dinner, once lunch would be served at\
  \ the Congress. I couldn\u2019t picture the scene of so many students preparing\
  \ their meals in a small kitchen. \nAlthough, I didn\u2019t expect to find out that\
  \ I misjudged my roommates. The girls were lovely and we had lots of conversations\
  \ during the nights and the breaks of the meetings. The boys in front of us were\
  \ surprisingly tidy and respected our space as ladies. The most remarkable moments\
  \ were when we all had dinner together: everybody talking about how the Congress\
  \ was interesting; smiles for all over the tables; greetings for the delicious food\
  \ and offerings for the cleaning after the meal. \nFrom that time on I stopped making\
  \ judgments about people and places before I really know their essence. Such experience\
  \ will be remembered forever, even if it sounds a little bit clich\xE9. I still\
  \ keep in touch with some friends I made in the hostel and sometimes we plan to\
  \ visit the same place and catch up the news from our academic life and have some\
  \ fun as well."
