Text: "30 March 2018, my last day in Romania after six months spent in Bucharest.\
  \ I came here as a volunteer in a European Voluntary Service project. Was a life-changing\
  \ experience. Go to a country that you don\u2019t know at all and be the sole Italian\
  \ in the project. \nI didn\u2019t really know what to expect when the 1st of October\
  \ I said goodbye to my family, to my friends and I left my hometown. \n\nBut let\u2019\
  s come back to the 30th of March, my last day in Romania. The day after I would\
  \ take a flight to Italy. \nFor my last day, our last day, we had, with the coordinator\
  \ of the project, Razvan, and with my teammates, Loann, Lisa and Katia, from France,\
  \ Maxi and Rebekka from Germany, our last trip. \nWe went to the Bucegi Mountains,\
  \ in a place at an altitude of more than 2200 meters high. I had never been to a\
  \ place so high before.\nI am from Cosenza, in the south of Italy, we have mountains,\
  \ but not so high, and to be honest I prefer the seaside.\n\nTraveling in Romania\
  \ means taking \u201Cold fashioned\u201D trains taking a lot of hours to get to\
  \ the destination. That's an experience too. While traveling one of the options\
  \ to pass the time is to look at the landscape, that means, when you travel from\
  \ Bucharest to the center of Romania, looking at forests, mountains, little villages\
  \ with their church and if you are lucky a castle. \n\nWe arrived in Busteni, a\
  \ small town in the center of Romania at the bottom of the Bucegi mountains, where\
  \ we took the cable car to get to the top of the mountain. \nOne of my friends was\
  \ scared to take the cable car, and while we were inside looking at the landscape,\
  \ surrounded by trees and snow, we started laughing when we saw Katia with her eyes\
  \ closed almost praying. Luckily for her it didn\u2019t take much to arrive at the\
  \ top of the mountain.\nWe get off the cable car and we started walking to our destination.\
  \ \nThere was a heavy cold wind arriving on our faces, while walking our legs were\
  \ sinking in the snow, we were following the steps of the others trying to avoid\
  \ this, and I can say that snow it\u2019s not my favourite path.\nEverything was\
  \ white except for the blue of the sky and the grey of some rocks.\nThat\u2019s\
  \ the reason we went there, these rocks. One of these looks like the sphinx. \n\
  Wait, a sphinx in Romania? Yes, if you watch it from a certain angle, it looks like\
  \ the Egyptian Sphinx, except for the fact that there is no sand but only snow around.\
  \ \nRazvan explained to us that Romanian people think that there is magical energy\
  \ in this place and there are a lot of conspiracy theories around it, one even involving\
  \ aliens.\nSomeone also says that this area is the \u201Cgate to heaven\u201D. That\
  \ time I believed it was true; there was a great silence, and you feel something\
  \ when you get there, listening to that silence. \n\nWe sat on some rocks close\
  \ to the Sphinx and I remember that a lot of memories came to my mind, that place\
  \ gave me the opportunity to reflect about my experience in Romania, how I changed\
  \ in six months, how I discovered a lot about myself.\nI have never thought that\
  \ being in the middle of nowhere, just snow, wind, and rocks, could be so amazing.\
  \ \n\nI said at the beginning I didn\u2019t know what to expect when I left my hometown.\
  \ After six months I felt happy about the choice I had made. I met wonderful people\
  \ in Romania, learned a lot of new things, understood what means living with people\
  \ from three different countries in a foreign nation. I learned a bit of Romanian\
  \ language, I talked with a lot of Romanian people telling me about their country,\
  \ the challenges they face, the dreams they have. \nAnd I went to Transylvania,\
  \ that it's not only \"Dracula\u2019s homeland\", but means wonderful castles, cities,\
  \ mountains and the Sphinx."
