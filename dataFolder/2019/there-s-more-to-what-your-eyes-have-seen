Text: 'There''s a saying that says "as far as your eyes can see do can you reach"
  everything seemed unrealistic in papers , pictures and online but the moment I set
  my eyes on this country I bet I was on another planet ,look it is the cleanest place
  not to mention the kind people it just felt like home but a little bit hotter than
  home, the green pastures, the blue skies, the different personalities, a different
  atmosphere, although the sun just decided to just stand right there and heat us
  it''s okay it''s okay thus far the flowers still look beautiful the trees still
  look good and unique. Who said "the grass is can never be greener on the other side?"
  Because trust me the grass is definitely greener on the other side. Such an amazing
  experience I could do it over and over again with no doubt in fact the sun can burn
  me over and over again. Singapore you''ve been good to me if you where human I''d
  go down on one knee under that sunset and ask you to marry me ,but see all I long
  for is to see you soon.

  It''s a date? Gosh I love you Singapore I love learning more about you, the different
  religions and the reasons why you are named "Singapore" your beauty us so Devin
  it''s just like rain on your wedding day (blessings) I''m definitely coming back
  to see you.'
