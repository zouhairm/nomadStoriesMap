Text: "And there we were, warm and 95, perked up in the in the backseat of a 1958\
  \ Buick, my hair stuck to my neck.\n\nLike the dream you had where you were floating\
  \ over vibrant green land while people gilded on earth\u2019s surface beneath you\
  \ - that\u2019s how my soul has felt ever since that young spring day in Havana.\n\
  \n\u201CHola, mi nombre es Reinaldo.\u201D\n\nMy bestfriend and I nervously smiled\
  \ at each other as the man slid onto the warm cream-colored passenger-side seat\
  \ of the taxi we were hunkered in the back of. Our first time in the vibrant city.\
  \ Was this a sign of what\u2019s to come?\n\nThe taxi took off, the wheels rolling\
  \ down the boiling pavement, the pavement that\u2019s supported it all, the pavement\
  \ that\u2019s seen love, fear, war, revolutions, that\u2019s heard the voices of\
  \ innovators, sinners, romantics, that\u2019s held the weight of leaders, heroes,\
  \ workers, and dreamers. My glances held long, but not long enough, taking in the\
  \ colors and the falling foundations that surrounded me.\n\nThe man continued to\
  \ talk, in english luckily, or broken pieces at least. We spoke about pastimes,\
  \ family chemistries, education systems and music. The more I listened, the more\
  \ my ears began to melt to the sound of his voice.\n\nOur early morning turned into\
  \ a late night as we sat on the balcony together teaching each other lessons of\
  \ languages. Two worlds becoming one. His warm arm around my chilled body. Words\
  \ flowing from our tongues like marker on a wet coffee filter, the more we said,\
  \ the prettier the picture became. We talked of a future. What would happen if we\
  \ did what people said isn\u2019t possible?\n\nThe man from Calle 41 wasn\u2019\
  t just a stranger any more, he wasn\u2019t just a man I exchanged eye contact with\
  \ in a taxi on that sultry Sunday morning. After three comely nights in the old,\
  \ winsome city, I was in love. \n\nOn the fourth morning, my bestfriend and I left\
  \ the city the same way we arrived - with the man from Calle 41 as the manifestation\
  \ in the front passenger-side seat, but this time he had a name, Reinaldo. My hair\
  \ still stuck to my neck. Will I ever see you again I thought to myself. \n\nA woeful\
  \ ending to a beautiful holiday, tears poured down my face as I dragged my feet\
  \ toward the long line of airport security, praying it wouldn\u2019t be the last\
  \ time I dove deep into the honey-brown eyes of the man I met just four days ago.\n\
  \nMinutes felt like years as my plane jetted over the blue waters that disconnected\
  \ the bodies of land. Two worlds that continue to turn, mysteries to those who have\
  \ never been. But when they say travel without leaving footprints, they\u2019re\
  \ not talking about footprints on the soul.\n\nMoments after my plane landed in\
  \ the United States, I received THE message, the warm arm around my chilled body,\
  \ the water to my colored coffee filter, the hand that held my heart. He\u2019s\
  \ thinking of me. \n\nAnd over 13 months later, I still receive the messages - but\
  \ this time, not as the man on Calle 41 nor the manifestation in the front passenger-side\
  \ seat - as Reinaldo, my strong and beloved boyfriend who wrote me the story of\
  \ a lifetime during those young spring days in Havana."
