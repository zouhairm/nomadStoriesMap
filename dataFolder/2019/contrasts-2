Text: "Contrasts\n\nWaking up, opening the window and breathing the air is everywhere\
  \ a different experience by itself. No matter wheter it\xB4s the grey block building\
  \ in german Bonn, where i was born, or the humid air oft he countryside of Chittagong\
  \ in Bangladesh, where my parents where born, or it\xB4s the buzzy and thick air\
  \ of Budapest\xB4s jewish quarter in Hungary, where i am currently staying. \n\n\
  For me as a German with Bengali roots, Eastern Europe was, half a year ago,  just\
  \ a big riddle. WIth most the eastern european states being mostly Roman-Catholic,\
  \ it was not natural for most of my friends, why i am leaving for a year to study\
  \ medicine abroad in Hungary. \n\nAfter walking around some months in this city,\
  \ especially in my quarter, i am just realizing more and more how contrasting this\
  \ city is. No matter the gouvernment is one of the most restrictive in the European\
  \ Union, and Hungary, especially the countryside, seems to stand mostly behind its\
  \ gouvernment, the jewish quarter Erszbetvaros seems to be liberal centre of protest\
  \ against the restricitve gouvernment. Doing that the quarter really became a magnet\
  \ for open-minded people. You are meeting, against my expectation, just people from\
  \ every colour and destination. \n\nI realize that in many different situations.\
  \ Talking to natives in the big smoking area of F\xFCge Udvar (one of he largest\
  \ ruin pubs in the city), or just listening to the performances of inhabitants at\
  \ the frequent open mic evenings,  where topics like LGBT, veganism and Jordan Petersen\
  \ are discussed as lively by internationals everywhere, that it reminds you of some\
  \ venues in Cologne or Berlin.\n\nI love absorbing everything new around me here.\
  \ Just watching the people in the 4/6 tram (the main centre line of public transport)\
  \ on their way to office or work in the morning, is just interesting. Eastern Europe\
  \ has it\xB4s very own vibe. But the people are also looking back and are always\
  \ open for having a decent talk !\n\nHungarian people don\xB4t really seem to be\
  \ mostly very happy over the day, when you meet them on their way to work, or even\
  \ in the office. \nBut it all changes in the late afternoon and early evening !\
  \ Then the city just completely changes. Cafe\xB4s, bars, and restaurants are just\
  \ starting to fill. When talking to them, it just feels like they really search\
  \ for distraction from grueling everyday life. And it\xB4s just a pleasure to jump\
  \ in !"
