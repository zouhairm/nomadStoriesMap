Text: "I remember that since I was a child I was always searching for things. New\
  \ things, weird things, beautiful things - everything that could make me understant\
  \ the world around me. Now I realize that the most intense search was for finding\
  \ myself. \nA few month ago I decided that it\u2019s time to change the environment\
  \ and I left with a scholarship in Bologna, Italy. Without knowing it, I arrived\
  \ in the perfect place for me to bloom. \nAt the first glance Bologna was a welcoming\
  \ city, so warm and cozy - and I am not saying that only metaphorically, but also\
  \ physically. The old architecture was painted in terracotta hues, pale yellow or\
  \ warm grays and adorned with contrasting windows in forest green or other natural\
  \ colors. \nJust by looking at the different buildings I had around me, I was descovering\
  \ always unique textures or a patterns, that were giving me a sense of calmness\
  \ just by their continuity, their repetitiveness. In the same time, they were leaving\
  \ me wanting to discover more of what Bologna has to offer. \nI enjoyed walking\
  \ a lot, mainly because of the fact that was way easier to observe all the details.\
  \ Even tho you could\u2019ve got from any point A to a point B located in the old\
  \ city center in around 30 minutes, my walks were always longer than that. I felt\
  \ the need to stop and admire mostly all the ancient details that the city preserved\
  \ through the years, just so we can see them today. \nOne of these details are the\
  \ columns, that happens to also be my favorites and you can find them all over the\
  \ city. Bologna has around 38 kilometers of porticoes and on all this lenght, with\
  \ around 1.5 meters between them, are all types of columns, in different styles\
  \ and colors.  \nThe landmark of the city is also an architectural treasure, the\
  \ Two Towers: Garisenda & Asinelli. Those are only two of the 100 towers Bologna\
  \ had in Middle Ages and of the 22 that lasted untill nowadays. Asinelli Tower is\
  \ actually the tallest one and can also be visited, offering one of the best panoramas\
  \ of Bologna. The view from the top let me saw how warm-colored and welcoming this\
  \ city is. \nI described this view as one of the best, because there\u2019s another\
  \ place that gave me a wonderful picture of Bologna from above - the Sanctuary of\
  \ the Madonna di San Luca. I prefered to walk to get there and I made the best decision:\
  \ these four kilometers of porticoes, around 600 to be more exact, filled with history\
  \ were so beautiful, that I didn\u2019t feel the time flying, nor the tiredness.\
  \ When I reached the top, I was surprised to discover an even warmer terracotta\
  \ colored basilica church surrounded by dark green trees and circular yard outlined\
  \ with a light concrete fence, all wonderfully highlighted by the sun. \nAlthough\
  \ I love walking on the streets of Bologna, I realized that seeing it from the top\
  \ helped me understand it better. And it thought me that I should make the same\
  \ exercise with me too: analyze and enjoy every detail that makes me an unique person,\
  \ but from time to time, I should take a step back and analyze myself as a whole.\
  \ I a warm-colored flower with an unstoppable desire to bloom. And I will bloom!"
