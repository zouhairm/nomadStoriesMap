Text: "There\u2019s no night sky like the desert\u2019s night sky.  Lying there, in\
  \ between the age old sand and the entire galaxy, can make you feel significantly\
  \ insignificant.  Each star neighbors so closely to each other that it\u2019s hard\
  \ to tell where one begins and another ends, but they all shine so distinctly that\
  \ it\u2019s as if they barely even share illumination.  No light pollution, no end\
  \ in sight, and no sound barriers to minimize any reverberation of noise.  And yet\
  \ even with all that vulnerability, there\u2019s a stillness that exuberates through\
  \ the dirt and the blaring sun, that leads into after hours, within the chill and\
  \ the voluptuous night sky. \nThis was my first reaction upon endeavoring into the\
  \ Israeli desert in 2012, as a indecisive 19 year old who barely knew which way\
  \ was up or whether up was even the direction I wanted to look towards, entering\
  \ the desert hit me like a brick. As the epicenter of the three major religions\
  \ in the world, it would be a difficult task to try to shake the weight of every\
  \ step you took throughout the secular state.  I felt this.  And although each historical\
  \ site brought with it it\u2019s own lessons, by the time we dragged our tired feet\
  \ across Israel and to the western desert, saying our bodies and minds were exhausted\
  \ would have been an understatement.  Hindsight being 20-20, I now see that that\u2019\
  s exactly what our program wanted us to feel by this point.  The desert is a long\
  \ standing form of depletion, so it\u2019s only right that you yourself would feel\
  \ depleted upon entering such barrenness. \nWhen we arrived at the auburn Bedouin\
  \ Tents, it was still light out.  Despite the desert sun, the most fascinating part\
  \ during the day is how sound can carry itself.  At one point, a few fighter jets\
  \ flew over our heads and for a solid 30 seconds afterwards, I couldn\u2019t hear\
  \ a single syllable a friend was profusely yelling in my ear to tell me that dinner\
  \ was going to be served in the adjacent building to our tent. \nOnce we had finished\
  \ our dinner, which culturally took place on the floor around an open coal fire,\
  \ we were told that our next activity was going to take place a couple hundred yards\
  \ away from our campsite.  The stragglers of the group, myself included, followed\
  \ in suit and found ourselves far enough away to still see where we came from, but\
  \ also know that if we walked any further,  we would have needed to sleep with the\
  \ buzzards and the desert camels. \nOur group of almost 30 began to finally quiet\
  \ down and our tour guide for the evening was able to successfully engage us to\
  \ his will for 20 minutes.  Considering our group, this was proudly considered a\
  \ win.  After the 20 minutes had passed, it was evident that the rest of us had\
  \ no intention of listening or retaining anything that was being said.  Instead,\
  \ he decided that the desert sky would speak for itself. And it did.\nLooking around\
  \ at us sitting in a circle, our tour guide asked us all to take the next 5 minutes\
  \ to be completely quite and to sit back, and fully appreciate the glory of the\
  \ full desert night sky.  We succumbed because 5 minutes was a simple enough task\
  \ to endure.  And so we all laid our backs against the cool hard ground and took\
  \ a deep collective inhale.  As luck would have it, upon our exhale, a shooting\
  \ star whizzed past the never-ending night sky.  We all erupted.  My immediate next\
  \ action was to take hold of the first thing my hand could find \u2013 which strangely\
  \ enough was a rock.  A rock that I still have to this day.  A rock that still coincidentally\
  \ fits so perfectly between my thumb and my index finger that you would think I\
  \ molded it from clay for that very purpose.   My rock. The rock that reminds me\
  \ that sometimes sitting still can bring unexpected beautiful miracles. The desert\
  \ rock, among other desert rocks."
