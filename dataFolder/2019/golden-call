Text: "It was just a normal September day and I was sitting at work in Kyiv office\
  \ bored by pushing paper around. \nSuddenly my phone rang. I looked at the screen\
  \ and my heart started to beat faster: it was an UAE number. \nI grabbed the phone\
  \ and ran like hell out from the office so nobody could hear my conversation.\n\"\
  Hello, am I speaking to Miss Kateryna?\"  asked the voice on the other end of the\
  \ line.\nMy throat was parched but I gathered all the strength and answered \"Hello!\
  \ Yes, It's me! It's Kate!\"\nMy heart was beating so fast, I was like a ticking\
  \ bomb going to explode the next moment.\n\"Kateryna, the voice said, my congratulations!\
  \ You were selected by Emirates airlines to become a cabin crew member!\" \nThe\
  \ lady paused for a few seconds professionally: it was a usual moment for a candidate\
  \ to scream/cry/laugh. But I did none of the above, I just continued to be a ticking\
  \ bomb with my head digesting the information.\nThe lady sighed, then continued:\
  \ Kateryna, now I need to ask you if you are ready to finish all your business,\
  \ sign a contract for 3 years and move at the beginning of October to Dubai\" \n\
  \"But it's September today...you mean, you mean I need to come in one month?\" \n\
  \"Exactly! So, do you agree to come on 6 of October so I can send you a contract\
  \ to sign?\"\nWe talked for a few minutes after I gave the main answer in my life\
  \ and the lady hang up.\nIt wasn't just a normal September day.\nI was standing\
  \ on the street looking at the screen of my phone. The autumn winds blew suddenly\
  \ and I shivered a little. \nThe unknown future was in the air: it was a wind of\
  \ change."
