Text: "Land of belief. That is where I come from. Place where people have all the\
  \ time in the world. What does a kid do? Kids go to school but here apparently there\
  \ is this kid who walks out at 11am after a hefty breakfast, you know eat like a\
  \ king and everything. He drags a little chair with him, slowly climbs up to the\
  \ roof and gets to duty. His colleagues have already taken usual positions in the\
  \ office. Only his office is a little differently set up. This guy, the king sits\
  \ center stage. The entire blue sky is his conference room. Do you want to guess\
  \ who his colleagues are now? Well, let me spare you the effort. \nThem be the those\
  \ beautiful creatures; everybody\u2019s morning walk buddy. Ok, enough suspense.\
  \ They sing. Birds. \nThis kid talks to birds. He don\u2019t go to school. \nWho\u2019\
  s to argue with him that he has to go to school, learn calculus, understand binary\
  \ code. Somebody should sit down and teach him binary. That is an episode to watch.\
  \ When I meet this guy, my life seems big. I try to crunch big numbers, learning\
  \ how to modulate efforts into matter of money. Dream of driving cadiallacs on Gold\
  \ coasts. But every now and then, I take that kid to be my inspiration to go on\
  \ with life. Only my skies don\u2019t have to be just blue. They could be orange,\
  \ yellow, pink, all the mix of colors in my cocktail that I wouldn\u2019t care to\
  \ brink. My chair should have a coffee cup holder and if time permits, I\u2019d\
  \ like the waves to clean the dirt in between my toes. \nMornings are crisp in my\
  \ city or now should I say, the city where I was born. They told me I came into\
  \ this world quietly on a festive evening. I took my time itseems and that\u2019\
  s kind of my style. I take my time on my ride. But just so light on my feet that\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t miss the checkpoint. Checkpoints where I can stop, park my wheels,\
  \ talk to some strangers along with my friends to make more, sipping some rich coffee\
  \ judging over the finesse in the milk. I\u2019m always on an unending hunt where\
  \ someone pulls out milk from a cow, puts it straight on a stove and into my cup.\
  \ If I find a place like that, I\u2019m going to invest in it and maybe build a\
  \ home opposite to those mountains. And then, find another one for lunch. Maybe,\
  \ just maybe another for dinner. \nSanta Monica has the best pier I have seen so\
  \ far. Although I feel the giant wheel should be a little more giant. Traveling\
  \ for me is about sinking in with the place. Staring at the street lights in a dim\
  \ lit parking spot listening to the radio play billboards. I do not think there\
  \ is so much of an unsafe place in this world. Well if someone says, there are few,\
  \ they might want to call me and take me for a brunch in the heart of that place.\
  \ I\u2019d like to have some talk with the locals. \nIs there so much time to visit\
  \ all the pictures I saved in my mobile. To write all that I wanted to on a camera\
  \ lens. Will I ever stumble across a rare tiger on a cold trail only to find it\u2019\
  s my guardian angel? Will I just keep staring at that kid every morning dragging\
  \ his little chair along with him? Are my gold coasts drive even more special than\
  \ his morning meetings? Should I stop arguing about who\u2019s is more better? I\
  \ won\u2019t. Because I wanna fight over these things. I want to go to war over\
  \ who\u2019s alcohol is more poisonous, over who parties like an animal. I\u2019\
  m not competing with the Russians. Walking into a city where people wake up and\
  \ dance at the beach for a daily routine, that will be my north. Although my compass\
  \ points to the direction upon which side lies what I want the most. Will it point\
  \ to all those curves, roads and beautiful eyes. Only time has to tell me. Peace."
