Text: "Perhaps it sounds a little unique to swim at a height of 4,100 meters above\
  \ sea level, in the middle of a snowy mountain. But it is possible in the National\
  \ Park of the Nevados. This journey starts on a hot Saturday in March with a couple\
  \ of friends, where they travel 3 hours from Ibagu\xE9, the capital of the department\
  \ of Tolima to the municipality of Murillo, we were received in a place where we\
  \ need to detail the colonial architecture and mix of colors in each of the houses\
  \ have you seen a house with yellow, brown and red ?, I tell you that in this place\
  \ there were hundreds of houses like that, with colonial balconies and a park that\
  \ paid homage to the colorful.\n\nIn order to settle to start this journey, we are\
  \ located in a hostel in front of the park and in the afternoon we go to a waterfall\
  \ known as \"El silencio\", to get out of the municipality to get into the rural\
  \ area and to do an ecological walk of approximately 30 minutes, during the road\
  \ the amount of flowers on the sides of the path that looked like a white carpet\
  \ is highlighted, and almost 300 steps that we had to descend to observe this natural\
  \ paradise, a waterfall of 30 meters high and 4 of depth, crystalline water in which\
  \ the rocks of the bottom were evident and that became a challenge to swim, being\
  \ to less than 3 degrees of temperature.\n\nAt nightfall we decided to meet the\
  \ other guests of the hostel to share anecdotes, knowing that we should wait for\
  \ the next morning. When we got up on Sunday, the first thing we saw through the\
  \ windows was the majestic snow of the Ruiz very close, imposing and white, it was\
  \ a sunny day and the most exciting thing is that in two hours we would be climbing\
  \ that place.\n\nTo get to the Nevado we took a car that took us to the base of\
  \ the mountain, we should walk for about two hours; only after half an hour of walking\
  \ we observed the first sign that said \"welcome to the snowy national park\", we\
  \ felt so much emotion that with only half an hour walking we could observe the\
  \ clouds lower than ever, and by the center of that wonderful We could see the \"\
  Guali\" River, which is beautiful as well as a historical landmark for our country,\
  \ this small river being the place where mudflows fell for the year 1985, destroying\
  \ the population of Armero Guayabal as it passed and causing the death of 25,000\
  \ people, therefore, was almost incredible to believe that the history learned in\
  \ our schools is reflected before our eyes and generates us so much calm.\n\nContinuing\
  \ with the tour and after an hour and a half ascending the Nevado, we saw at 4000\
  \ meters high the first frailejones, which are thick trunk plants and large leaves,\
  \ it was the first time I saw one outside the TV screen and the best thing is that\
  \ it was not just one, ten minutes later there were hundreds of these plants around\
  \ the road.\n\nAnother twenty minutes later we saw a small cabin that warned us\
  \ that we had arrived, finally we were at our final destination called \"Termalitos\"\
  , they are beautiful hot springs with a light blue color, the water was at a temperature\
  \ of 30 degrees Celsius which were perfect for counteracting the cold breeze to\
  \ three degrees that was received while walking, was one of the most wonderful experiences\
  \ of life, being in the water we saw hot water spouting from our feet with a sulfur\
  \ smell and if we looked up we were surrounded by trees, nature, frailejones, observe\
  \ the descent and there was absolute peace.\n\nIt was a wonderful experience! Every\
  \ landscape, every step, every thermal sensation has been worth it and from there\
  \ I reiterate that we all have to swim in the middle of a snowy mountain at least\
  \ once in our life, considering that in front of a good landscape and A good company\
  \ forgets fatigue and obstacles that arise.\n\nThank you."
