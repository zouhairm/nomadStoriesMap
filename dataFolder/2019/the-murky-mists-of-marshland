Text: "Fog, transcendent early summer morning fog, embracing us as we drive deeper\
  \ into the countryside hoping not to bump into some wild animal and actually get\
  \ to our destination in time. This might get a little tricky as we have slept just\
  \ under an hour, all exhausted from endless exams nevertheless extremely exhilarated\
  \ for our first ever experience of paddle boarding in the bog. \n\nYou\u2019ll have\
  \ to agree \u2013 not many have had a chance to do that. Actually, majority of the\
  \ people have never been to a marsh, simply because such territories are quite rare\
  \ (at least in Europe). The one we are heading to is Cena Moorland located 30 kilometres\
  \ from Riga, the capital of Latvia. It is a Nature Reserve with peat mine still\
  \ functioning these days.\n\nSome minor blunders, some wrong turns taken but here\
  \ we are, enjoying the uniqueness and atmosphere of the place. WE. Who exactly are\
  \ we? Well, two slightly silly college girls in colourful dresses (mind you, dress\
  \ more appropriately for such occasions if you don\u2019t want to freeze your bum\
  \ off, even if it is summer and you want to look gorgeous) who spontaneously decided\
  \ to go on an adventure the night before. Ready to carry 15 kilograms of equipment\
  \ for 2 kilometres keeping our eyes open to see the hidden, well preserved beauty\
  \ and experience the extraordinary \u2013 tiny pines wrapped in the blanket of fog\
  \ the colour of milk, wild berries peeking from the depths of fluffy moss like jewels,\
  \ spider webs in the most unthinkable places covered in tiny pearls of dew. \n\n\
  Walking through this landscape, slightly reminiscent of miniature savannah, you\
  \ walk through space and time, lost in your thoughts, taking in the enormous quiet\
  \ around. It seems like a virgin place, untouched, untroubled. Unfortunately, far\
  \ from it. The war came here too. During The Christmas Battle (World War I) this\
  \ bog saw a lot of blood and gore when Latvian Riflemen fought against German forces\
  \ for six days. Nowadays it seems almost inconceivable, but the traces of entrenchments,\
  \ memorial signs and the museum nearby are here to remind us of the history.\n\n\
  As heavy bags thud on the wooden platform near the Skaista lake I\u2019m drawn out\
  \ of my ponderings; now is the time to do some more work in order to finally rest.\
  \ Sharp breaths, tense arms, first drops of sweat. When it seems that everything\
  \ that\u2019s left in this world is you pumping up a paddle board, comes the moment\
  \ of consolation - a light nudge and you slip into the dark water cutting it up\
  \ like a knife, yet mysteriously leaving it untouched. Balance. It\u2019s all about\
  \ it. At first difficult to find but once you let the water carry you it all starts\
  \ to make perfect sense. All the troubles you faced to get here fade, all the freezing\
  \ fingers and toes are forgotten. Everything that matters is this moment in the\
  \ crisp air that so vividly contrasts with the warm water of the lake. The soft\
  \ rays of the sun, barely woken up, illuminate the sharp edges of long dead branches\
  \ which give the scenery an almost fairy tale feeling. A dark and twisted fairy\
  \ tale although that\u2019s exactly what gives it the most singular impression.\n\
  \nThe intricate details of the delicate spider nets catch my eye again. Then my\
  \ eyes shut. It feels like the second best decision I\u2019ve made today. Soaking\
  \ up the surroundings is so much easier like that \u2013 lying down on the paddle\
  \ board, both feet in the water and a paddle on the chest like a sword on an ancient\
  \ Viking who has been sent on his last journey. \n\nTranquil peace. However, it\
  \ was not destined to last for long. Joyous voices of children suddenly echo around\
  \ shaking the rusty air up. The first visitors are here, bringing with them the\
  \ world we so gladly left behind.\n\nIt\u2019s not without a silver lining though\
  \ \u2013 the smell of pine trees, the warmth of sunlight on my face, the sound of\
  \ wild geese crying out \u2013 it all stays with me. And one day I\u2019m going\
  \ to come back.\n\nI promise."
