Text: "Smiling to myself, I walk up to the restaurant I chose on name alone - Nirvana\
  \ Caf\xE9. It was kismet for a homesick Seattleite. Stepping inside, the rich scent\
  \ of curry spices wafting towards me vilified my choice and momentarily transported\
  \ me to my go-to restaurant back home.\n\nAfter approaching me in French and noticing\
  \ the distinct lack of registry on my face, the owner smiles and switches to an\
  \ accented English, gesturing behind him with a kind, \u201CSit anywhere.\u201D\
  \ Glancing towards the crowded back of the restaurant, I hesitantly sink into a\
  \ chair at a large table near the quiet front window, hoping to catch the last rays\
  \ of the sun as it sets over Luxembourg. A lone girl at a four-top on a Friday night\
  \ in a restaurant would never go well back home, but taking note of other patrons\
  \ that have taken the same approach, I assume this isn\u2019t a social faux pas\
  \ in the sleepy European town. \n\nMouth nearly watering I order myself curry and\
  \ settle in to take in my surroundings. The sky has pitched to a vibrant orange\
  \ that fades into a deep purple over the picturesque buildings along the upper rim\
  \ of the city. A pleasant and steady stream of ambient noise from the diners entering\
  \ and exiting the restaurant puts me at ease, and the other diners seem to have\
  \ the same feeling. The woman quietly scrolling through her phone at the large table\
  \ adjacent quietly coughs, a group of women at the window laugh in hushed tones\
  \ and the owner at the counter softly talks to an employee. It\u2019s a peaceful\
  \ restaurant, a place with enough familiar comfort that I can think about home while\
  \ appreciating the wonderful foreign differences found in a new country. \n\nThe\
  \ door sweeps open to let in a group of four women and a sharp gust of wind, a reminder\
  \ that summer is nearing end and fall creeps steadily closer. \n\nI watch the owner\
  \ look approach them with a greeting before turning towards the restaurant, smile\
  \ dropping as distress blooms across his face noticing that while there are open\
  \ tables, none that comfortably sit four people. His eyes land on my table and before\
  \ he opens his mouth I stand, offering to move in broken French, mentally kicking\
  \ myself for ignoring my instinct and settling at a table that large by myself.\
  \ The owner gratefully (and perhaps amusedly due to my stuttered French) smiles\
  \ and begins to look around for a new table for me when the lone woman previously\
  \ scrolling her phone says, \u201CYou can sit here if you want,\u201D in crystalline\
  \ English. \n\nThanking both of us the owner seats the newcomers and I settle in\
  \ across from the woman, wondering if this is going to be a dinner in companionable\
  \ silence as she turns back to her phone. Reaching for my book my head snaps up\
  \ when she suddenly asks, \u201CSo where are you from?\u201D\n\nA quick sigh of\
  \ relief that she asks in English. \n\n\u201CI\u2019m from Seattle and just got\
  \ into Luxembourg.\u201D\n\nLaughing she says, \u201CHey me too, do you also work\
  \ for Amazon?\u201D A quick scan of her face and I can see she\u2019s not kidding,\
  \ so picking my chin up off of the floor I slowly shake my head and ask where she\
  \ went to high school. \n\nA vegan Indian restaurant across the world and this woman\
  \ went to a rival high school, and we happen to sit next to each other. \n\nWe spent\
  \ the rest of the meal talking about home, her about her kids, me mostly talking\
  \ about my dog, restaurants and hole-in-the-wall type places we missed and making\
  \ mildly derisive comments about a few mutual rival schools. In our mutual excitement\
  \ we didn\u2019t even share names or numbers, we simply had a lovely meal and enjoyed\
  \ each other\u2019s company, appreciating the small piece of home we\u2019d found\
  \ in each other while so far away. \n\nSometimes you need that human connection,\
  \ that reminder than no matter how massive the world may seem it\u2019s not as imposing\
  \ or secular as it may seem. Home isn\u2019t as far as you think, sometimes it\u2019\
  s only a table away."
