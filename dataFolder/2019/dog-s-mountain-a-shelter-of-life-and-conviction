Text: "I was afraid when I saw almost 80 dogs running directly to the car, some huge\
  \ ones, some small, all of them with something in common, an incessant movement\
  \ on their tails.\n\nAfter a two hours rode from Bogot\xE1 the capital city of Colombia,\
  \ we arrieved to a huge mountain call La Punta , a place with few settlers, full\
  \ of vegetation, water and rocks. In this place Lucila Carmona a 50 years old women\
  \ full of strenght, with a loudly voice and some signs of dog love (scratches in\
  \ her arms and legs) manage\xB4s a shelter were dogs from all ages, have been rehabilitated\
  \ from cruelty, abandon and in the worst cases rapes.\n\nHer voice was intense and\
  \ mocking, come down don't be afraid, they are pure love; Parallel to Her Words\
  \ Two huge dogs started figthing for what it seems to be the corpse of some dog\
  \ toy, she got distracted to make them break. I was there with two of my best friends,\
  \ seeing each other and unconciously laughing, because we were afraid, and did not\
  \ want to run, but to be braves.\n\nSudendly tree more cars arrieved and with out\
  \ hesitate a bunch of kids in between 10 and 14 years old, whent out and start greeting\
  \ the dogs, that jumped and just started licking their hands with enthusiam. That\
  \ was the sign, we went out of the car and walked straight into the entrance; that\
  \ day we started a magical relation with 80 souls that hopped to have a second chance.We\
  \ were supposed to stay 2 days there, we end up sleeping there during 1 week and\
  \ now we go at least twice per month.\n\nEach morning at 5am Lucila and Manolo,\
  \ are wake up by a unify chorus of barks and howls. The day start with a smile,\
  \ conviction and mental strengh - a fundamental aspect to keep working hard each\
  \ day-  by 7 am all the integrantes have ate a cup full of concentrate,then, a sense\
  \ of peace fill the mountain. Some dogs run from the top until the bottom of the\
  \ mountain, others lay on the grass and rocks, majority sleeps, play or bite all\
  \ kind of imaginable toys.\n\nThe shelter occupies 2 hectares, , many birds that\
  \ are already used to the dogs come to eat fruits and flight up and down, it almost\
  \ seems they play with the dogs, meanwhile they fligh 4 puppies run fast triying\
  \ to catch them. They do not want to harm them, instead they jump and move their\
  \ tails. .  \nBelly facing to the sky, the tongue out and what seems to be a smile,\
  \ thats the face of love, recovery of faith and animals nature!\n\nAfter a day of\
  \ feeding, cleaning and supervising, the authors of all that hapinness sat down\
  \ in a huge coach strategically situated on the top of the moutain, they drank a\
  \ cofee and see the powerfull landscape; The one they are part of, full of positive\
  \ changes, vegetation, harmony and hapinness. That week was hard, full of physical\
  \ work, and definetly, it was the best gym ever if we considerated how much we sweat.And\
  \ at the end we share their thought, all is worth it if at the end of the process\
  \ you see how slowlly, but infallibly, the expresion of an abused dog becames a\
  \ prove of joy. \n\nAfter one week on magic we needed to go back to the city, to\
  \ the chaos and to the lonyless of many street dogs that havent meet angels like\
  \ them, but our life changed for ever, because we understood the posibility of working\
  \ hard for others, and because since then, we also wake up with a chorus of barks,\
  \ a private concert of Linda, Rocky and Mandy, the dogs that gave us a second chance."
