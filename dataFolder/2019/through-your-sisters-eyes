Text: "In July 2014 Greg was diagnosed with stage 4 mesothelioma and given a prognosis\
  \ of 6-12 months. Mesothelioma is a rare and deadly cancer caused by asbestos, the\
  \ only scientifically proven cause. \u201CThey say you only start to value something\
  \ in your life when you are faced with them being gone. Fortunately for us we had\
  \ shared a life full of fun experiences and loads of learning and laughter. It is\
  \ true, wisdom = valuing the things you have, while you have them. \n\nUncle Rej\
  \ passed away on the 14th of October, 4 months after you were diagnosed. Life just\
  \ kept serving up reminders of how fleeting it is. Sitting behind you at the funeral\
  \ shook me to the core. Watching while Mum spoke through tears of her memories &\
  \ love of her only brother. I was so scared of you not being part of the future.\
  \ I was still in shock and denial, pretending all was OK and we could get through\
  \ this. Greg worked for both James Hardy & BP during his apprenticeship where he\
  \ was exposed to asbestos frequently. Greg valued work and always gave selflessly\
  \ in pursuit of a successful career. He lived a very clean and healthy life, was\
  \ mindful of what he ate, didn't drink or smoke and would meditate daily. As with\
  \ every diagnosis and subsequent prognosis it all came as a massive shock. To give\
  \ some perspective to the bond Greg and I shared, we described each other as best\
  \ friends, shared similar ways of seeing, yet often challenging each other in debate\
  \ to test resolve and seek to understanding of all ways of being.\n\nConfronted\
  \ with the news, I researched alternative treatments that could be combined safely\
  \ with the Chemo & Radiotherapy Greg had decided to accept. The first thought was\
  \ of the Amazon but considering the limitations we faced in regards to time and\
  \ distance, I realised that local custodians would also hold ancient healing wisdom\
  \ right on our doorstep. I had mentioned the idea to Greg & he was receptive, so,\
  \ I made the booking & sent him the ticket. At that point I hadn't confirmed we\
  \ could see Frank for the dates I booked or even if he was in town. When I made\
  \ the enquiry, Sue, who assists Frank with the bookings had said \"Sam, if you are\
  \ happy to just go with the flow, everything will be as it is meant\"\n\nWe started\
  \ out on the 21st of November 2014 for a few days in Alice Springs. The intention\
  \ was to catch up with Frank Ansell, Ngangkari.\nThe Ngangkari are spiritual healers\
  \ who have passed their ancient wisdom from generation to generation practicing\
  \ touch & spirit healing.\nMeeting Frank was an experience neither of us will forget.\
  \ We had no idea what to expect. On meeting Frank & sitting with him a feeling of\
  \ total calm & peace engulfed us. Frank performed a healing on Greg by placing his\
  \ hands above his head & singing an ancient song. He then clasped the energy from\
  \ my brothers chest and pulled it out, releasing it to the universe. He spoke of\
  \ his teacher & of his path & of ours, unique & all encompassing. We too are healers,\
  \ believers & of god.\n\nSitting with Frank was a life changing experience. On leaving\
  \ our energy is incredibly light & infinite, no fear, no doubt, only love, peace\
  \ & gratitude. Greg was for the first time in a long time free of pain. No aches,\
  \ No pain. No cancer.\nWe will all pass from these bodies but our journey is eternal.\
  \ Words don't do the experience justice. It is more than words, it is feeling &\
  \ knowledge.\nWe are blessed, we are well, we are great spirit. \n\nThere comes\
  \ a time when all the conditioning and influences that brought you to that moment,\
  \ no longer dictate the person you unwillingly choose to be. The key to reacting\
  \ less is choosing to act on how we want to feel, not on how we feel. To walk in\
  \ the shoes of another opens hearts and minds\nIntention of being become us, show\
  \ gratitude in choice creation where love is the only law."
