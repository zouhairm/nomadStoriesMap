Text: "Traveling around the world within a ship, I found myself with a series of questions,\
  \ \nHow to capture the attention of people, \nHow to make them find the showcase\
  \ that would make them smile when they discovered the world ?, \nAnd walk on all\
  \ those immense landscapes full of culture, languages and colors, I was still finding\
  \ people without smiles, no matter where I was, Italy, France, Spain, Malta, Canada,\
  \ and I was wondering; Why we always want what we do not have ?, I was fascinated\
  \ with all those new people, those new countries and it was on returning to Mexico\
  \ that I understood the hunger I feel for devouring the world with smiles and love,\
  \ and I realize the great answer to my questions, AUTHENTICITY, that is the reason\
  \ why Mexico is one of the most visited countries , there is no better food, party\
  \ and colors in the world, with this I do not try to say that the rest of the world\
  \ has no attractions, on the opposite, but it is there in that small showcase of\
  \ reality, looking for  the fascination, sharing the culture that arise in our soul\
  \ and escaping through that beautiful and small hole we call eyes, There is nothing\
  \ more beautiful than a shining look of seeing new horizon and enjoying with new\
  \ people, that is what is enriching to travel, accompanied by a notebook that keeps\
  \ those details that neither the photographs could keep in time, the words on paper\
  \ as the firmament of what this planet needs, !BE TRANSPARENT, BE AUTHENTIC!, there\
  \ is the real journey.\n\nBecause to travel is to expand the mind, to shake old\
  \ versions of oneself, to delight the palate of new food that in each bite shows\
  \ a dose of magic transported in their condiments, to see those people walk on the\
  \ avenues, living their lives to the natural, without noticing that from the other\
  \ side of the world we do not even think about that, there in that little grocery\
  \ shop where you can provide yourself , in that child's smile on the corner selling\
  \ chewing gummies , there in the subway finding faces that do not seem to have a\
  \ good day, there it is where the mind expands, in the encounter with something\
  \ different from our reality, because the world is a leaf carried by the wind gently\
  \ until it finds the perfect autumn to prostrate itself as it is to travel.\n\n\
  Looking for a good wine in all those restaurants, looking for a cigarette, looking\
  \ for a new adventure,looking for a new knowledge, looking for a shiny way that\
  \ lead my life, looking for my life goal, looking for a new chance, looking for\
  \ a new love, looking for new music that my voice gonna sing, looking for a new\
  \ letter for my journal, looking for new instagram pictures, looking for a miracle,\
  \ looking for that light fill it up my soul, in all those street surrounding by\
  \ trees , hearing the noise of the cars and realizing the bus going to cruise the\
  \ street, there in all those places I was looking for something, !There is where\
  \ I found the love!, in every sound , every whistle, every street, every person,\
  \ there in the airport waiting for my flight to go back home, there I was looking\
  \ for, AUTHENTICITY, to be ready to still biting every hidden corner of the world."
