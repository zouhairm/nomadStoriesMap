Text: "Having moved 14 times now between five countries, many years back when shifting\
  \ to India, I hadn't known what to expect. I had suffered ten years, Celiac Disease.\
  \ Western doctors would repeatedly tell me there was no cure for this.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PugGvhPvPe8&t=46s\n\
  \n\nI came across a Youtube channel of things I was interested in, which brought\
  \ me to a saint by the name of Paramahamsa Nithyananda. He had cured people of lupus,\
  \ cancer, and life threatening illnesses.\n\nI took a two day trip down South in\
  \ a very bad train. I came to a place called Thiruvanmalai, a splendid area that\
  \ probably had the best natural settings I'd seen uptil that point in my life. It\
  \ was like Mother Nature had blessed this place and it was overflowing in abundance\
  \ of greenery and lusciousness I'd not seen in my life growing up in the US and\
  \ Canada up until then. \n\nI first saw one glimpse of a young 30 something yogi,\
  \ saying something very casually, I immediately thought I knew him before. I felt\
  \ strongly connected to him in a way I cannot explain. \n\nHe took us to Arunachala\
  \ a hill with a temple in Thiruvanamalai where he was born. He told us he'd never\
  \ taken devotees there. The intricate work of the South Indian temples was astounding.\
  \ I wandered around the temples while my father meditated. I marveled at European\
  \ Greek Art while I was young understanding the Renaissance period in Europe. But\
  \ this was far more detailed. I wondered how many years it took to make, almost\
  \ hundreds of idols carved into the temple with tons of colors and structured in\
  \ a way that had a logic to it, mathematical, proportional. \n\nMe and my father\
  \ were met by a local man who wanted to show us something. He took us to an area\
  \ that was closed and locked away, to which he had the key. He showed us an area\
  \ with two padaukas, feet like representations honoring a saint or God in India,\
  \ and he explain that these were the very footprints of Lord Shiva many many centuries\
  \ ago he walked the planet Earth, the most powerful God in Hinduism. Though some\
  \ Westerners regard Hinduism as myth, I had many experiences proving this was very\
  \ real. It was a religion that accepted different paths, didn't say only one path\
  \ was right to God, and even allowed atheists. It provided some of the highest experiences\
  \ I had in my life, and yet it was tolerant, and accepting of all.\n\nI later visited\
  \ various parts of India with this master. I went to Hardiwar on my birthday which\
  \ was a very religious part of India, communities of people living very simple lives,\
  \ but a beauty in that simplicity when it is intertwined with the sacred, with the\
  \ Divine. The purity in the faces of people was very much apparent. You would see\
  \ tons of temples everywhere with people doing various practices. Sastras, Tantras,\
  \ various texts, Hinduism has more that a 1,000 texts. \n\nOne particular program,\
  \ my Guru held in Varanasi. Varanasi, said to be the oldest city in known civilization.\
  \ My Guru explains that people there used to  fly. Having had dreams of being able\
  \ to fly connected to my thoughts, I had to go. My parents used to do a practice\
  \ called Guru Gita everyday and Vishnu Sahsranam, ancient texts from the Sanskrit\
  \ language, one of the oldest languages in the world which speaks in the context\
  \ of enlightenment, mentioned about the importance of Varanasi. My Guru mentions\
  \ that in Hinduism, we talk about Avatars, when God comes down in human form when\
  \ humanity is lost the most, that Varanasi had the most amount of incarnations,\
  \ avatars on the planet because the vibrations where so high.\n\nIndia was a fascinating\
  \ place. Without my Guru, I wouldn't have had certain spiritual experiences take\
  \ place. It was a very rich land which the British stole and looted from constantly.\
  \ It was regarded as the jewel in their crown, the Kohinoor diamond literally taken\
  \ from India. The ones who follow this master we wish to revive Hinduism to it's\
  \ peak, and serve the world through it."
