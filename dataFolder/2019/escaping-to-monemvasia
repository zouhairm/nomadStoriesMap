Text: "Escaping to Monemvasia\n\nLooking from above, the orange Byzantine rooftops\
  \ of the city of Monemvasia appear carefully staggered. As the eyes drift downwards,\
  \ the narrow alleys slowly surrender their sinuous curves. They\u2019re rendered\
  \ meaningless once they reach the turquoise sea that extends far past the horizon.\
  \ It is a spectacle offered only to those who succeed in climbing to the summit\
  \ of the rock to reach the Agia Sophia, an emblematic church dating back to the\
  \ 12th century.\n\nThe fortified city, of Byzantine origin, occupied by the Venetians\
  \ and Ottomans and eventually reconquered by the Greeks, is located on a peninsula\
  \ carved on a rocky slope south of the Peloponnese, in the heart of a Greece historically\
  \ agitated by the battles of empires. Today, it is the calm and the wild beauty\
  \ of the place that make up the charm of Monemvasia, a quiet town closed off to\
  \ cars. A narrow road joins the mainland to this picturesque island whose only and\
  \ modest entrance attests to the etymology of the Greek name of the city: \u201C\
  mone\u201D, unique, \u201Cemvasia\u201D, entrance.\n\nAs I passed the gates, I was\
  \ immediately struck by the flowery tranquility that reigns in the corridors of\
  \ the citadel. An armada of colors ravels out to the visitors and the inhabitants:\
  \ dazzling cascades of fuchsia bougainvillea, deep green cacti, laurels and eucalyptus,\
  \ all hanging off of the walls and window sills.\n\nWhen the shops close, locals\
  \ and tourists clink to the sweet rhythm of the setting sun, a glass of Malvasia\
  \ wine in hand, accompanied by the soft sound of a bouzouki. In the famous Tavern\
  \ of Matoulas, coloruful mez\xE9s are served: Tzatziki, Taramosalata, Saganiki,\
  \ stuffed vine leaves and calamari, followed later on in the evening by the legendary\
  \ sweet Loukoumades.\n\nAfter a night in the splendid hotel Malvasia, I am quick\
  \ to reach the sea. The beauty of the place at dawn is somehow inexplicably even\
  \ more striking than the day before. Tranquility sweeps through narrow shuttered\
  \ alleyways and the labyrinth of secret passages finally brings me to the sparkling\
  \ kingdom of Poseidon.\n\nWhile bathing in the limpid Aegean Sea, I admire the fortifications,\
  \ which were built deliberately to remove the city from the sight of pirates. I\
  \ remind myself of the words spoken by a few inhabitants the day before: \u201C\
  Monemvasia is visible from nowhere unless you are facing it straight on, and it\
  \ is quick to disappear as soon as you begin to move away.\u201D\n\nAs the hour\
  \ of departure approaches, I walk the alleys and come to encounter an old man who,\
  \ after poking his head out of the small window of his kitchen, invites me to taste\
  \ his fish soup, Kakkavi, a delectable type of Greek bouillabaisse.\n\nHung somewhat\
  \ secretly above my work desk is a picture taken from above, of this half-wild peninsula,\
  \ which I often admire in the hopes of returning sometime soon. I invite those who\
  \ venture to Greece to make a halt in Monemvasia, and to remember and perhaps learn\
  \ again what it is to take one\u2019s time and connect to the present."
