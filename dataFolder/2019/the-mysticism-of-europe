Text: "Brexit is a word on everyone\u2019s lips and being a proud Remoaner, I revelled\
  \ in the chance to visit Brussels, the de facto capital of Europe and the EU\u2019\
  s home. The Belgian capital is a city filled with duplicity, balancing the sleek\
  \ silver governmental buildings with a Medieval heart oozing opulence. It seems\
  \ extremely fitting that the European Union finds its home here in this metropolis,\
  \ as the city perfectly encapsulates the traditional past and advancing future synonymous\
  \ with Europe.\n\nAfter exploring the ancient streets of the Old Town, the greatest\
  \ of surprises unveiled itself. The Grand Place is a surprisingly hidden complex\
  \ that comes alive as you discover it. Surrounded by grand churches and a patchwork\
  \ of Renaissance architecture, the Medieval heart of Brussels unfurls itself in\
  \ a mix of majesty and gold-adorned wonder. A plaza surrounded by some of Europe\u2019\
  s oldest and grandest buildings. It truly is breathtaking. \n\nDeciding to take\
  \ a break from explorations my boyfriend and I sampled the notorious Belgian waffles\
  \ (something everyone should try). Whilst sitting in an al fresco caf\xE9, a commotion\
  \ erupted. Naturally, being as nosey as we were, we immediately headed back inside.\
  \ \n\nOur senses were bombarded.\n\nBang. Clank. Clip-Clop.\n\nSpeaking the most\
  \ broken French, we ascertained that this was the Ommegang of Brussels and it was\
  \ a spectacle. A reenactment of the parade to honour the arrival of Charles V in\
  \ 1549 was being recreated right before our very eyes. An entire cast decked out\
  \ in all their finery performed a masterclass in Medieval revelry. Alongside the\
  \ mock-royals, performances of lute playing, flag dancing and fire dancing all entertain\
  \ the gathered crowd. \n\nThe fire dancers were particularly entrancing but broken\
  \ up as some rowdy knights insisted in a jousting battle. An excited crowd released\
  \ that expectant murmur, the loudest and quietest of sounds in one. A scream erupted\
  \ from behind a gleaming helmet and the knights charged at each other - their horses\
  \ pounding the floor as they picked up speed.\n\nMiss!\n\nAs the knights prepared\
  \ for second attempt, a spotlight directed us to the raised platform where the royalty\
  \ of Medieval Europe had positioned themselves. The Grand Place was filled with\
  \ cheers, laughter and amazement as the event reached an historic peak. \n\nA passionate\
  \ speech informed the audience of the significance behind the gathering, and attention\
  \ shifted towards the emergence of an opera singer. It was an intimate and personal\
  \ performance that completed the immersion into this world. It felt truly authentic,\
  \ and at that moment I did believe I had been transported through history. \n\n\
  The head of the parade then issued a speech, informing us that the Ommegang had\
  \ been successful, and the royal houses would take the procession out onto the streets.\
  \ The audience, like the actors, fled out of the plaza to see the next stage to\
  \ the celebrations.\n\nWe adopted a strategic position to see as far as we possibly\
  \ could. The procession marched through the crowd-lined avenues and roads, with\
  \ new additions flooding in to join the celebrations. Princesses passed by in horse-drawn\
  \ carriages whilst bishops and mock-Popes marched whilst bellowing ancient Latin\
  \ parables. Decorated warriors rode decadently dressed horses alongside comical\
  \ wizards who appeared to be casting spells. There were giant plaster figures that\
  \ covered stilts to give the illusion of giants within this crazy parade.\n\nThe\
  \ celebrations culminated in what became a huge, impromptu street party. Bars and\
  \ cafes all threw open their doors and windows and revellers amassed in the streets\
  \ fuelled by wine and beer. It was so very European, yet uniquely Belgian. The smell\
  \ of barbecued meats flooded the air as everyone united their happiness with food\
  \ and alcohol.\n\nHappiness. Friendship. Fascination. Wonder. Fun.\n\nIf only we\
  \ had shown these moments when campaigning during the EU referendum."
