Text: "It's been a while since I travelled somewhere. And now here I am at the country\
  \ of freedoms, Canada. \n\nFor over 20 years I been trapped home . In a country\
  \ where I grow up . In a country that's not mine, But it was good. Yup it was, because\
  \ I'm forced now to find another country. \n\nCanada was my dream.  Just to see\
  \ how beautiful it is , and to see the charm of nature . Yet it was so hard . But\
  \ I finally made it. Canada, the country of happiness . \n\nIt was a short trip\
  \ there. Went for a visit to one of my friends but it was worth the fight. Seeing\
  \ my friend was sweet but what really enchanted me was the beauty of it . How people\
  \ are happy and sweet. Golden sunsets and amazing nature, and of.course maple .\
  \ \n\nVancouver was my favourite. The pearly white mountains, the beautiful beach\
  \ , and how amazing the food was. If not the best . \n\nI guess you figured when\
  \ did I went to Canada. Yup ! It was in Christmas. The greatest holiday in the year.\
  \ The city become alive with arted street light figures, and the sweets and food\
  \ of Christmas was like heaven on earth. And yeah alot of maple.  Tho I was crazy\
  \ cold , but the beauty and the people there keeps you warm because it's just simply\
  \ amazing. \n\nMy next stop was Toronto. The city of night life. It's more like\
  \ Dubai but it's more nicer . The city becomes alive at night. The lights are so\
  \ charming and you just get lost in the beauty of the city.  It was amazing. \n\n\
  Here is Christmas day came. And people are buzzing . Shopping for Christmas, buying\
  \ gifts, food , cloths , everything. Even if you don't have family, you'll have\
  \ family there . People are sweeter than horny in Canada and you won't feel alone.\
  \ \n\nChristmas night, the night that every one waiting for . Churches are all blooming\
  \ , the lights are so breath taking , and happy Christmas songs playing and sang\
  \ every where.\n\nFor me it was so different.  And so amazing to the max , for a\
  \ guy that have never been out for along time and to see beauty like that.  It's\
  \ speechless. And it's really sweet.  Finally for 20 years I got finally to see\
  \ my favourite country. It was a relife."
