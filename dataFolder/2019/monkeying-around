Text: "With a racing heart, sweaty palms and trembling legs, I took a deep breath\
  \ and jumped. \n\nAs the wind whipped through my hair, I heard screams of delight.\
  \ It was only when I tasted the forest dew I realised my mouth was wide open and\
  \ that sound was coming from me. I forced my eyes open to find myself soaring above\
  \ the trees. \n\nThe dramatic scenery was blurred by the breathtaking speed so when\
  \ I came to a halt, I dangled - suspended 150 metres off the ground - and soaked\
  \ up the bird\u2019s eye views.\n\nSituated in Bokeo Nature Reserve in Laos, the\
  \ Gibbon Experience is a conservation project which allows visitors unique access\
  \ to the rainforest.\n\nEverything about it is exhilarating yet petrifying from\
  \ the accommodation \u2013 a canopy level treehouse - to the transport \u2013 the\
  \ only way in and out of the treehouse is via zipwire. \n\nAfter a quick safety\
  \ demonstration in broken English, we were free to explore the jungle. \n\nWe spent\
  \ a high octane day surfing the jungle canopy, launching ourselves into the abyss,\
  \ floating over valleys, gliding through a labyrinth of ancient trees. \n    \n\
  By the time I collapsed into bed, even the orchestra of crickets and bed-hogging\
  \ creepy crawlies couldn\u2019t stop me from sinking into the land of nod.\n\nThe\
  \ next morning, the jungle was shrouded in mist so flinging yourself off the platform\
  \ involved a leap of faith but one which paid merit. Propelling yourself into the\
  \ jungle wide-eyed is invigorating enough but doing it blind was pure euphoric.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019m not going to lie \u2013 this isn\u2019t the easiest way to get your\
  \ kicks. The steep trek through the dense forest to reach the network of zip-wires\
  \ is torturous. The jungle is filled with cranky critters that bite, sting and suck,\
  \ all of which insist on sharing your bed, toilet, food and even pants. The rain\
  \ is relentless. And there are no guarantees you will see any gibbons.\n\nBut if\
  \ you have a head for heights and want to fulfil a childhood fantasy while laying\
  \ claim to sleeping in one of the \u201CTop 10 Most Precariously Placed Treehouses\
  \ on Earth\u201D I highly recommended this trip. Vertigo-sufferers need not apply."
