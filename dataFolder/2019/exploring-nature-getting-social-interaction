Text: "I was studying in China , Doing Medical there so i got semester break for one\
  \ month , i made plan to visit And explore China , i Take chance of travel to waterfall\
  \ area , on that time while i was travelling i found many chinese people that Need\
  \ to communite with me ,i was not able to speak full fluient Chinese language ,\
  \ but i found they were very kind to me , i had to know about their culture while\
  \ i was travelling , I Visited Detain waterfall near to Vietnam border , Detian\
  \ Waterfall is a transnational waterfall in the Sino-Vietnamese border, ranking\
  \ the largest transnational waterfall in Asia and the fourth largest transnational\
  \ waterfall in the world.It takes about 3 hours from Nanning City to the Detian\
  \ Waterfall.\nIt is the highlight in Detian Waterfall Scenic Area.\nIn spring, the\
  \ fiery-red kapoks peculiar to the south scatter around the waterfall and make it\
  \ more beautiful.\nVisitors can enjoy the cascade groups, boating, or fishing at\
  \ the foot of the mountains. Located in Shuolong Town\uFF0CGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous\
  \ Region, the Detian Waterfall originates from the Guichun River which passes Vietnam\
  \ and winds back Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. When the Guichun River arriving\
  \ at the bluff in Detian Village, Daxin County, then the Detian Waterfall formed.\
  \ Up on the about 200-meter wide bluff, the waterfall pours down with the drop of\
  \ 70 meters. Visitors can the resonant roars kilometers away. If who visit the waterfall\
  \ early in the morning, he would enjoy the rainbow when the rising sun shining on\
  \ the mist upon the waterfall.\n\nThe Detian Waterfall is divided into three layers:\
  \ the upper layer, the gradual slope, and the lower layer. In the upper layer, the\
  \ water rushes along the almost vertical bluff, and pours down into the deep pool\
  \ with silvery spray splashing upon the pool. Then the waterfall comes to the gradual\
  \ slop, in which the waterfall has an opportunity to relax after the onrush before\
  \ and gather momentum for the grandest lower layer. In the lower layer, the water\
  \ rushes down and open a marvelous natural picture with wide water screen and surrounding\
  \ green trees. In summer, the Detian waterfall has the largest water flow , \n\n\
  (Nearby Attractions)\n\n1. Tongling Grand Canyon\n\nIt is a closed crayon with rectangle\
  \ shape, about 37 kilometers from the Detian Waterfall. Visitors there can enjoy\
  \ the waterfall with the biggest drop in China and the wonder of cliff burial, and\
  \ visit the unique buildings in Zhuang style and the primeval forest with many rare\
  \ plants.\n\n2. Mingshi Scenic Area\nThe rural scenery in Mingshi Village is honored\
  \ as \u2018little Guilin\u2019 for its green mountains and blue waters. The beautiful\
  \ natural rural scenery can be found all around the village.\nCultural Life\n Chinese\
  \ culture is clearly predominant. Because the minorities in Guangxi possess neither\
  \ a unified organization nor support by fraternal groups, their assimilation by\
  \ the Chinese is far more advanced than in the other autonomous regions. The underlying\
  \ causes of what appear to be the region\u2019s ethnic tensions are economic and\
  \ geographic factors that have exerted a powerful influence on cultural trends.\n\
  \nEducation\n\nA special educational feature in Guangxi is the program for the education\
  \ of national minorities. Minority languages are used for instruction in primary\
  \ and middle schools, written scripts (such as that for the Zhuang language) are\
  \ developed for spoken minority languages wherever needed, minority teachers are\
  \ trained, and government subsidies are provided for minority students. Instruction\
  \ in the Zhuang language is offered where the size of the Zhuang population warrants\
  \ it. The Institute for Minorities in Nanning trains both intellectuals and technical\
  \ specialists of minority descent to work among the minority peoples below the county\
  \ level. Institutions of higher education include Guangxi University at Nanning\
  \ and Guangxi Normal University at Guilin, as well as Guangxi Medical University\
  \ and the Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medical University, both also at Nanning.\
  \ The Museum of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Library of the Region are\
  \ located in Nanning \n \nIn Guangxi, Chinese culture is clearly predominant. Because\
  \ the minorities in Guangxi possess neither a unified organization nor support by\
  \ fraternal groups, their assimilation by the Chinese is far more advanced than\
  \ in the other autonomous regions"
