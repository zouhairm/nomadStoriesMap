Text: "Part 1\n\n\n\nThe coach carried us across the narrow bridge, over the murky\
  \ Mekong, then dropped and thudded onto a small slip road. We were now on a puddle-strewn\
  \ dirt path, still wet from the night\u2019s rain. A small peloton of motorbikes\
  \ drove alongside us. They were rushing \u2014 bouncing and weaving around rain-filled\
  \ potholes, and causing a dusty red mist to rise into the gradually heating morning\
  \ air.\n\nIt was early. I lifted my glasses and rubbed my eyes, straining to see\
  \ through the tinted window. I saw that the mighty river was now on our left-hand\
  \ side. After running past this point \u2014 near the Thai border town of Chiang\
  \ Klong where we\u2019d just left, and Huay Xai where we would start our voyage\
  \ \u2014 the swirling brown water I could see would slide southwards. It would drain\
  \ through Cambodia and into Vietnam\u2019s Mekong Delta, with its swamps and rice\
  \ paddies, before eventually spilling its dirty guts into the South China Sea. \n\
  \nWe drove for a few more minutes, and stopped near a collection of wooden buildings\
  \ that lined the road which dropped down to the water\u2019s edge. The motorbikes\
  \ that had passed us on the way, just after the border bridge, were parked on either\
  \ side of the road. There was a melee of people. They were crouching down and lifting\
  \ things. I couldn\u2019t quite make out what though, through yet more swirling\
  \ dust, this time caused by a dozen pairs of shuffling sandals. \n\nThe driver turned\
  \ the engine off.  Stepping off the bus a few minutes later, one of the last to\
  \ do so, it became clear: the motorbike riders had passed us to set up shop and\
  \ sell us stuff. \n\nI bought a cigarette lighter and straw hat, then looked down\
  \ the slope at the wide and menacing Mekong. I saw a row of boats, about seven or\
  \ eight, all tied up in the water. They bobbed with the aggressive current. We were\
  \ leaving for our two-day slow boat cruise in twenty minutes, so I walked away from\
  \ the street sellers to a small yet busy shop. \n\nI stocked up, buying a chicken\
  \ baguette, a two-litre water bottle, and six small cans of Beer Laos. Finally,\
  \ no more Chiang, Tiger, and Singha, which was all they served back in Thailand.\n\
  \nThe longer I travelled (this was my fourth month in Southeast Asia), the less\
  \ I planned. I arrived alone in Laos without a to-do list, but after the boat ride\
  \ to Luang Prabang, I wanted to visit Vientiane, the capital city. \n\n\u201CToo\
  \ early for a beer?\u201D asked the stranger in front. \n\n\u201CNever,\u201D I\
  \ replied, unable to say no.  \n\n\u201CWhat are your plans in Laos?\u201D I asked\
  \ him, after he\u2019d introduced himself as James, from Liverpool, which is not\
  \ far from my hometown. \n\n\u201CNot sure, I've not planned much,\u201D James said.\
  \ \n\n\u201CTake it day by day, I guess\u201D\n\nWe were both solo travellers, and\
  \ spoke until we embarked and the boat chugged into life. \n\n\n\nPart 2\n\n\n\n\
  \u201CStrike!\u201D \n\nJames, who I had spent the last two days with, ever since\
  \ that beer by the jetty in Huay Xai, knocked over the battered pins at the end\
  \ of our lane. He had won our game. \n\n\u201CWell played,\u201D I shouted over\
  \ the noise. \n\nIt was three in the morning. I was drunk. So was everybody else.\
  \ The bowling alley was the only place serving alcohol in Luang Prabang past the\
  \ eleven o\u2019clock curfew.\n\nIt was surreal, bowling in the middle of Laos,\
  \ well past midnight. James, who had finished being congratulated by the others\
  \ playing with us, turned to me. \n\n\u201CI knew nothing about Laos before, but\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to find this.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat,\u201D I said.\n\n\u201C\
  This fucked-up bowling alley,\u201D he slurred as he swayed, gesturing to the room.\
  \ \n\nWe stood beneath flashing disco lights. Western pop music played. Bowling\
  \ balls smashed into clattering pins at the end of lanes either side of ours.  \n\
  \n\u201CWeird, right,\u201D he said. \n\nI looked towards the entrance to the room.\
  \ A small group entered. Outside, I could see a row of large targets, and a line\
  \ of people with bows and arrows. \n\n\u201CFancy some archery next?\u201D I asked.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYou\u2019re right,\u201D I added, \u201Cthis is weird.\u201D"
