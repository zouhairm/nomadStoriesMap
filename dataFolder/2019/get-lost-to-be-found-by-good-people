  \n- Ibn Battuta\n\nHave you ever 'get lost' when you were on a trip?\nYou went to\
  \ somewhere, but then you had no idea how to go back.\nI did!\n\nIt happened in\
  \ November 2017 when I was on a trip to South Korea.\nThat day, I was going to Pyeongchang\
  \ to attend the Dream Concert at the Olympic Plaza. You might heard of Pyeongchang\
  \ since The 2018 Winter Olympics was held there.\nI was staying in Seoul that time\
  \ and the KTX to go to Pyeongchang was still on process, so I had to go there by\
  \ bus.\nI wasn't sure enought at that time, since there\_ weren't that much information\
  \ and I wasn't that good either at korean, so I just bought a bus ticket to Pyeongchang\
  \ Station.\nWhile I was waiting for the bus, I saw some crew of a Brazilian magazine\
  \ were also waiting for the same bus like me. I approached and said hi to them.\n\
  I know them because they were one of the sponsors when my favorite korean group,\
  \ B.I.G came to Brazil.\nThey were going there for the concert as well and they\
  \ also got the ticket from B.I.G's company. What a coincidence!\nWhen we finally\
  \ reached our destination, we asked some people about the venue. Surprisingly, the\
  \ venue was still so far, so we decided to go to their hotel by taxi because the\
  \ hotel supposed to be near the venue.\nThere were six of us, so we took two taxies.\
  \ I need to say I was lucky enough to meet them, so I don't have to be alone. Even\
  \ luckier because the taxi fare turned out to be extremely expensive. It's better\
  \ devided by three than pay it all alone, right?\n\nThe concert was started at 5\
  \ pm. It was 3 degrees that night, but I feel like it was really cold. I used to\
  \ walk around with just a t-shirt and jacket during 3 degrees nights in Seoul, but\
  \ in Pyeongchang it felt so much different.\nI enjoyed the beautiful and awesome\
  \ concert, but I decided to go out before the concert ended. I need to find a way\
  \ back to Seoul since I didn't book any hotel there.\nI was looking for information\
  \ at the venue, but unfortunately they said the ticket to go to Seoul was sold out.\n\
  They told me to ask the people at the shuttle bus stop. I asked them and they told\
  \ me to go to the parking lot. I went there and asked again. I think some people\
  \ that I asked were the volunteer at the parking lot. They weren't that good in\
  \ english but I'm blessed because they tried their best to help me.\nThey called\
  \ some bus drivers if there's a spot for me. After that, two of them were accompanied\
  \ me to go to another parking lot to got nothing. So, we rode another bus and during\
  \ our ride, they told me that the last choice was I had to find a hotel to stay\
  \ if we couldn't get a ticket. We stopped at a bus stop then we walked for a while\
  \ till we finally reached a bus station. I actually didn't know they brought me\
  \ to a bus station.\nThe other guy helped me to ask the ticket and yasss! I got\
  \ a ticket! Both of them even accompanied me and made sure I went into the bus,\
  \ but before that I asked them to snap a picture with me.\nI was so grateful I met\
  \ them. I didn't know what will happen to me if I didn't meet them.\nBecause of\
  \ these good people God sent me, I was able to go back to Seoul safely.\n\nWhat\
  \ I want to say is... It was quite fun adventure to go to an unfamiliar place, then\
  \ get lost, and how you found that there were still a lot of good people in this\
  \ world.\nOne day, if you meet a wanderer on their journey, please remember to be\
  \ that one good person to reach them out. It's always good to be a good person."
