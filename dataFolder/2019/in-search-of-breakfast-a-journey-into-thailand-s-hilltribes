Text: "It feels like we are driving back in time as we leave Chiang Mai and modern\
  \ life behind us.  Hours later the roads become narrower, rough and winding.  Villages\
  \ are smaller and less frequent. We are heading to the remote hill tribe villages\
  \ of Northern Thailand.  \nThe twisty roads begin to climb. Higher and higher into\
  \ the mountains we drive, each bend revealing another steep incline.  My husband\
  \ is casting dirty looks at me from the driver\u2019s seat.\nWe are a month into\
  \ a three-month journey through South East Asia with our two children.  This five\
  \ day, 700km drive from Chiang Mai to the Golden Triangle and Chiang Rai was my\
  \ idea. It is day two and we are wondering what we have gotten ourselves into. \
  \ \nThe rented car is playing up, the gearbox isn\u2019t working, slowly, slowly,\
  \ we climb an endless hill.  Until we stop.  And start to roll backwards.  My heart\
  \ stops too, there is panic in the back seat and the children yell \u2018Dad\u2019\
  !  He remains calm, only the shaking of his hands giving away his stress.  A hand\
  \ brake start, and we climb again, inching our way to the top of the hill in first\
  \ gear.  We do this again and again as the afternoon wears on.\nIt is the end of\
  \ the day when we arrive in Mae Salong, the market is closing.  The day trippers\
  \ have left on their bus, whole families pile precariously onto motorbikes to ride\
  \ home.  A woman of the indigenous Akha hill tribe stands out in her striking dress.\
  \  \nShe is delighted to make a last sale for the day.  Our daughter is fitted for\
  \ her very own Akha dress, hand-dyed and embroidered. They smile and pose for pictures\
  \ together, a little girl from New Zealand and a beautiful Akha woman.  Her traditional\
  \ headdress dripping with coins, feathers, pompoms, tassels and long silver chains.\
  \  There is no language, there is a smile and a connection, this is what we travel\
  \ for.\nThere is Thai wine for sale, we need it after that journey.  I didn\u2019\
  t know Thailand made wine until today.  Turns out there is a reason why it isn\u2019\
  t famous. It is like drinking bad vinegar. We pour it into the hotel sink and go\
  \ to bed early.\nWaking up to sunrise over the tea plantations, there is a misty\
  \ haze in the air.  We\u2019re looking forward to breakfast on the terrace, but\
  \ the hotel breakfast looks awful; the greasy smell stops us venturing further.\
  \  I want to go back to Mae Salong where there is at least coffee.  But it is uphill,\
  \ and my husband is stubbornly refusing to drive back up that hill.  I toss an emergency\
  \ packet of crisps to the children in the back seat and we set off, downhill, in\
  \ search of breakfast.   \nWe follow a sort of route towards Mae Sai and the Golden\
  \ Triangle.  Detouring into likely looking villages along the way, looking for food,\
  \ we soon become hopelessly lost.  The roads are narrow and steep, turning around\
  \ impossible.  We climb higher again, through villages of a just a few bamboo stilt\
  \ houses, chickens scratching in the dirt, mothers with babies strapped to their\
  \ backs.  But no sign of breakfast.   \nWe arrive at a town with a busy morning\
  \ market underway.  We are the only tourists.  After browsing the market offerings,\
  \ we decide that although we are quite hungry, we really don\u2019t feel like frogs\
  \ for breakfast.  \nThere is a 7-11 (a convenience store) and there we discover\
  \ one of the simple joys of our trip, the 7-11 breakfast.  Iced coffee for Mum and\
  \ Dad, choices of yoghurt and cereal with milk.  The complication is that some cereals\
  \ come in a type of bowl packaging, but others don\u2019t.  At least one person\
  \ chooses a cereal with its own bowl, this person eats first and then gives their\
  \ bowl to the next person to mix and eat theirs.  \nAll of this is done on the side\
  \ of the road, as we become the entertainment, attracting the inquisitive stares\
  \ of local people.  Rather than the tourist visiting the attraction, we become the\
  \ attraction\u2026"
