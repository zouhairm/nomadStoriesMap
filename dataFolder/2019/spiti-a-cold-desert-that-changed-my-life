Text: "It was only after I left my boyfriend of two years, I decided to do something\
  \ gutsy and to go to Spiti Valley, Himachal Pradesh because of the awe-inspiring\
  \ beauty of the Great Himalayas  and my love for exploration and local interaction.\
  \ And because I couldn\u2019t breathe in the city anymore. I wanted a break, I wanted\
  \ to rejuvenate. Be away from all sorts of social media, technology, etc. In a journey\
  \ of self exploration and self finding.. while on a budget, I wanted to go to a\
  \ places that still was so pure and hardly was touched by technology or materialism\
  \ of today\u2019s world and all the other evils that we\u2019re used to living with\
  \ now. I ended up going on a solo trip to a cold desert, alone. A solo female traveller\
  \ in India with mostly good experiences to share, where I met people from different\
  \ nationalities and even the localites. Every person I met taught me something new.\
  \ Of course a lot of life lessons to which a 700 word limit essay could perhaps\
  \ never even describe. Some negative but a lot more positives. The beauty lies in\
  \ the people of Spiti and the simplicity in the basic sense where we reach the stage\
  \ of self actualisation at an earlier stage because the mountains make you live\
  \ your life. They say if you submit to them, they have ample for everyone to not\
  \ just survive but live. One of the days during my travel i had no money because\
  \ the only ATM in the district had no cash, I rode a bike 80kms away from the last\
  \ village and 10 kms away from the nearest habitation. Trekked to the valley in\
  \ the cold desert, for 4 hours to get to the banks of the frozen Spiti river with\
  \ winds upto 30kmph and the temperature dropping to a -20\xB0C, I was alone but\
  \ for the first time not so lonely. I tried pitching my tent but miserably failed\
  \ at it, I had to sleep covered in the tent but I\u2019d do it all over again. For\
  \ the Milky Way that I saw, all by myself\u2014and hundreds and thousands of shooting\
  \ stars in one night. Never in my life had I ever seen something so beautiful, so\
  \ beautiful that it makes you want to cry. My hair froze and turned into dreads,\
  \ the skin on my cheeks cracked and turned red because of the high altitude and\
  \ the harsh temperature. But I\u2019d do it again, that night...I was alone, all\
  \ by myself, under the Milky Way, under a light of a billion stars. The earth lit\
  \ up with the twinkling of the stars, the frozen water shone, the peaks were covered\
  \ with snow. Of course even though I was on a budget and hardly was left with any\
  \ money, ended up extending my stay from a week and a half stay to a month\u2019\
  s stay...I volunteered to teach in a monastery and got to graze yaks and fill water\
  \ in earthen pots. I got free accommodation because I would cook food at the homestay\
  \ I was staying at, well, only dinner. I met a chef from France who loved the butter\
  \ chicken I made and this gentleman called Aaron who\u2019s introduce himself to\
  \ locals as \u201CARUN\u201D so that it would be easier for them to remember him,\
  \ he said. Barbecues on charcoal \u201Canghithi\u201D with the local spirit\u2014\
  arak and sea buck thorn preserves and locals singing and children dancing near the\
  \ bonfire. All in all, I love adventures and I love proving to myself that I\u2019\
  m only going to get stronger everyday. I met people who have inspired me to be more,\
  \ to be the change, to explore and live every day.  And I hope my stories make people\
  \ want to live and experience and exchange with people. Open themselves and be vulnerable\
  \ because, all of this makes us stronger every day. People interact in real life\
  \ than on phone. We make connections and connect with people, empathise, learn,\
  \ grow, and of course share. We spread our wings and this is what Spiti had to offer\
  \ me."
