Text: "I am standing at the exit of the Mohrenstrasse U-Bahn station. I\u2019m among\
  \ the first to arrive, but it takes only seconds for Mohammed to notice me. He immediately\
  \ smiles and rushes over, enthusiastically extending his hand to introduce himself.\n\
  \nI quickly discover Mohammed is a cheerful, chatty 28-year-old. I also learn he\u2019\
  s a Syrian who fled his home country after he was imprisoned by government forces\
  \ in Aleppo, and he arrived in Berlin in 2014 as a refugee. Today he\u2019ll be\
  \ our tour guide.\n\nMohammed clears his throat, addressing the group for the first\
  \ time: \u201CToday I want to answer the question: \u2018Why are we here?\u2019\
  \ This is the one question people want to ask me, but never do.\u201D He gestures\
  \ for us to follow him, and we do.\n\nOur first stop on the walking tour is the\
  \ German Department of Finance, a building that reflects the stages of Germany\u2019\
  s turbulent history more clearly than almost any other building in the capital.\
  \ Here, Mohammed describes the East German uprising of 1953 and how the demonstrators\
  \ were brutally suppressed by the regime. Hundreds of people died \u201Cjust asking\
  \ for their basic rights\u201D, he tells us. He points to the bullet-scarred buildings,\
  \ which he says remind him of the streets of his hometown of Hama, Syria, where\
  \ half a million people gathered to protest against Assad\u2019s government in 2011.\
  \ The uprising was violently crushed by the state within days. \u201CThese two stories\
  \ are similar,\u201D he informs us. \u201CThey are both about people fighting for\
  \ their freedom, their rights, what they should have.\u201D\n\nCheckpoint Charlie,\
  \ the iconic wall-crossing between East and West Germany, is our next stop. It is\
  \ here Mohammed shares with us his own story of crossing borders. He\u2019d been\
  \ a student in Aleppo, studying mathematics, when he was arrested for publishing\
  \ anti-government sentiments on social media. Detained and tortured, he was eventually\
  \ released. Not wanting to endanger his family, he left immediately: first to Egypt,\
  \ then to Libya. When the situation in Libya worsened, he was smuggled across the\
  \ Mediterranean Sea to Italy by boat. From there, he made his way to Germany.\n\n\
  We stop again. This time outside of the Topography of Terror, located where the\
  \ former Nazi government\u2019s secret police and its paramilitary force once had\
  \ their headquarters. The buildings were destroyed during the war, but their foundations\
  \ have been excavated and serve as a backdrop for the museum whose primary purpose\
  \ is to educate the public about the heinous crimes committed by the Nazi regime.\
  \ Here, Mohammed draws parallels between Germany's Nazi past and modern Syrian history.\
  \ He explains the origins of the civil strife in Syria, the atrocities carried out\
  \ by the Assad regime, and the rise and fall of the Free Syrian Army.\n\nHe pauses\
  \ for a moment, before continuing. \u201CThe regime didn\u2019t even spare a group\
  \ of 14-year-old boys, who had written graffiti saying, \u2018Your turn, Doctor\u2019\
  , on their school walls,\u201D he tells us. He is referring to the incident in the\
  \ small town of Daraa that ignited the present-day conflict. Standing at the site\
  \ of the former Nazi headquarters and hearing Mohammed\u2019s words, I finally begin\
  \ to understand the severity of the ongoing situation in Syria.\n\nOur tour concludes\
  \ at Gendarmenmarkt, which is home to an architecturally impressive ensemble of\
  \ cathedrals and a concert hall. We stop in front of the looming French cathedral,\
  \ where he tells us that it was built in 1701 by the Huguenots, an immigrant community\
  \ from France and stood directly adjacent to the Lutheran Protestant cathedral of\
  \ the German natives. Despite the animosity between the two groups, the Edict of\
  \ Potsdam ensured the protection of the Huguenots\u2019 religious freedom and civil\
  \ rights. According to Mohammed, today the two buildings are \"a beautiful symbol\
  \ of how welcoming Germany can be.\u201D \n\nAfter the tour, I ask Mohammed a few\
  \ more questions. Most of all, I want to know why he started giving these tours\
  \ in the first place. Without hesitating, he responds: \u201CThere\u2019s a huge\
  \ misunderstanding of what a refugee is. If people understand the context and history\
  \ of why people come here, perhaps instead of talking about refugees all the time,\
  \ they\u2019ll start talking with us instead.\u201D"
