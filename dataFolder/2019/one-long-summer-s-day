Text: "Her passionate, Irish spirit leapt into the unknown heavens on a sunny, sweltering\
  \ Sydney afternoon. Clamoured bodies rushed to revive a woman who would dare to\
  \ die on such a beautiful day. A mother. As the sun gleamed as a hopeful eremite,\
  \ all we could see was darkness. We could feel the gush of a cool breeze that wasn\u2019\
  t there. It was cold. \n\n\nIt was a long plane flight. My feet swelled, the man\
  \ beside me smelt of deep anxiety and the whiskey was just strong enough to send\
  \ me into a flickering slumber, and somewhat deaden some of my doubts. \n\n\u201C\
  What would you like, miss?\u201D\n\nWill I be surprised by what I discovered? Was\
  \ she kind? Was she funny? Will her family like me? Will they despise me? Am I like\
  \ her?\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll have another whiskey please.\u201D\n\n\nI tucked my violin\
  \ under my arm and soaked in the impressive stares of many people also collecting\
  \ their luggage. I\u2019m just a beginner.  Although pretending I had arrived to\
  \ play Bach for the cultured Irish was perhaps a somewhat easier fiction for me\
  \ to reconcile than dwelling on the true reason I had come. The size of my case\
  \ must imply that I\u2019ll be here for a while. \n\nMy legs, immovable as pyramids,\
  \ my lips, dry as firewood and my arm, burdened by the violinist career I will never\
  \ have, led me through the mechanical, nostalgic gates of change. I scanned a sea\
  \ of ginger faces, my mind half reconciled to the truth that I may be greeted by\
  \ a sterile valet, nervously holding my misspelt name, until. \n\nHe is there. His\
  \ swimming blue eyes and face as warm as the sun, pulls me into an eternal embrace.\
  \ \n\u201CYou are just like her,\u201D he stammers, \u201CYou are just like your\
  \ mother.\u201D\n\nDublin is cold. It rained yesterday, it will rain tomorrow. Today\
  \ is just grey, thank God. My blue-eyed uncle has just called to remind me that\
  \ we\u2019re having roast lamb tonight. Also, that my young cousin Christopher has\
  \ finished the last Harry Potter book, and is almost epileptic with excitement to\
  \ watch it together. Tonight perhaps. He tells me to stop bringing Australian made\
  \ wines to dinner, and asks whether or not my neighbours have complained about my\
  \ violin playing yet. \n\n\u201CThey must just appreciate good music\u201D I tell\
  \ him. He tells me it might snow.\n\n\nHer school friends hold my face in their\
  \ hands with such vigour, as if I too might suddenly vanish. They rummage through\
  \ years of memories and tell me about the first time they smoked a cigarette together.\
  \ The first time they fell in love. The times they fought and argued. \n\n\u201C\
  \ She was bossy\u201D they say through a proud and surreptitious grin, \u201CShe\
  \ never NOT had an opinion.\u201D\n\nI meet a stranger, a man in the hospital who\
  \ knows who I am at a glance, and without any exchange, says playfully,\n\n\u201C\
  You must be Caroline\u2019s daughter.\u201D He firmly hugs me, \u201CShe was a good\
  \ friend of mine. I had no idea you were here.\u201D He holds me tighter and longer,\
  \ \u201CYou are just like her.\u201D\n\nDublin is rarely sunny. The sky is always\
  \ full of rain. I am plagued by the perpetual shiver. Yet, in every pint of Guinness,\
  \ in every trill of the r\u2019s and bang of the drum, in every stranger\u2019s\
  \ smile and glittered raindrop, I see a lonely, single ray. I am reminded of her.\
  \ Reminded that she was a daughter, a loving sister, a mischievous friend, lover,\
  \ and devoted mother. And as I stand in the place that she once stood, I never expected\
  \ to discover that she was human. That she was who she was and we are who we are.\
  \ And that, in all its disgrace, is still beautiful."
