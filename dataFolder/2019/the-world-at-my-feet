Text: Stepping into a prisitine, colourful delight of Japan, Tokyo, the new, vibrant
  city  with all the gadgets and brilliance of buildings and then to the ancient Kyoto,
  with the Geisha girls and the more traditional way of iife, to see order, the neatness
  in the supermarkets and gift shops, no mess, no rubbish, just cleanliness in evertwhere
  I looked. Seeing Mount Fuji, in all it's glory, white capped and snow clad, the
  views from the room was spectacular, the glistening waters, shining in the sun and
  the reflection of the mountain in the water through moonlit strands. I dsin't expect
  to find all this love, attention to detail in all the hotel rooms we stayed in and
  the friendliness of the peple, even those who didn't understand English, would help
  using their phones to guide us in the direction we needed to go, the beauty was
  everywhere, the roads, the shops, the train station, sitting on the bullet train
  taking us from place to place in hurriedness to get the next destination, an apology
  if one minute late. The Japanese people are always ahead of schedule, never behind.
  The gorgeouness of the clothes that they were, mixed with modern and traditional.
  Seeing Hiroshimo that was sobering and eerie, seeing all the children's items of
  clothing, play toys, the essence of them. The story of the girl who survived and
  wiled her time by making origami swans. This is what I didn't expect to see in Japan,
  I knew about the History and all that had happened, but the warmth, the beauty,
  the mix of old and new. Japan surprised me no end and want to go and see more.
