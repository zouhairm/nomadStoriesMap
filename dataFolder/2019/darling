Text: "Darling\n\nI was in my early twenties in 1993 when I first flew into Cambodia.\
  \ Phnom Penh was crazy-wild, an outlaw city full of colour and life. \n\u201CWhere\
  \ you go, mister?\u201D \nA scrawny Cambodian guy on an ancient moped flashed me\
  \ a hopeful look. Behind him the street was a muddy mess \u2212 a bedlam of bicycles,\
  \ pedestrians, beggars, motorbikes and beat-up cars splattered in mud. \nBefore\
  \ I arrived all I knew about Cambodia was the horror of skeletal people staggering\
  \ into a deserted city, but these Khmers looked as if they were going to a garden\
  \ party \u2212 pork pie hats and button-up shirts, wide-brimmed hats and gloves.\
  \ \n\u201CWhere you go? I take you. Go Killing Fields?\u201D\n\u201CNo thanks,\u201D\
  \ I said, for the twentieth time. \n\u201CYou go me?\u201D\nThe man patted the seat\
  \ behind him, keeping pace. \u201CYou go me. Go Killing Fields. See bones.\u201D\
  \nI shook my head. \u201CMe walk,\u201D I said, sounding as if I was in some bad\
  \ Tarzan movie. \nThe moto-taxi man took off swerving into the traffic like he was\
  \ playing dodgems.\nI stomped through the mud, skirting mounds of garbage on every\
  \ corner, jumping puddles like a pre-schooler. Above my head electric wires of different\
  \ colours and widths decorated the street, high-voltage party streamers. Pock-marked\
  \ French colonial terraces flew washing like flags. \n\u201CWhere you go, mister.\
  \ See bones?\u201D\nI sighed and turned around. \u201CNo go.\u201D \n\nAs the early\
  \ morning coolness evaporated the sun felt fierce enough to make the puddles boil.\
  \ The open gutters reeked and when I blew my nose black smeared the tissue. Dark\
  \ clouds hovered on the horizon. My shirt stuck to my back with sweat. The further\
  \ I walked the more beggars I collected: mothers with children clinging to their\
  \ skirts, old women without teeth. Soldiers my age with one pant leg folded up bounded\
  \ towards me on crutches. \nWhen the hundredth moto-taxi pull up beside me, I gave\
  \ him a grouchy: \u201CNo go. I walk.\u201D\nBut when I saw him, I regretted it.\
  \ This man was no average moto-taxi driver. His face reminded me of a God from one\
  \ of the temples I\u2019d seen in my guidebook. He was beautiful, full-lipped and\
  \ heavy-lidded with high cheekbones that lifted his face out of the ordinary. Eyes\
  \ so black I saw myself reflected in them. \nI swiped sweaty hair from my forehead.\
  \ \n\u201CWould you like ride with me?\u201D he asked, still smiling.\nThat caught\
  \ me off-guard. \u201CYou speak English?\u201D\n\u201CA little. I will take you\
  \ where you go.\u201D\n\u201CMore than a little.\u201D \nHe smiled down at his bike.\
  \ \u201CCan I practise speaking with you? No need to pay money.\u201D \nI stepped\
  \ back. \u201CNot pay?\u201D I\u2019d been travelling alone long enough to know\
  \ when things weren\u2019t right. I\u2019d seen the guns slung over the shoulders\
  \ of soldiers that loitered on street corners. They didn\u2019t look like UN forces\
  \ to me. \n\u201CDarling. You and me. Darling.\u201D He beamed again and patted\
  \ the seat behind him.\n\u201CDarling? I\u2026I\u2019m walking. I don\u2019t want\
  \ to ride.\u201D I\u2019d learned enough to know that most Asian men thought white\
  \ women were easy targets, but this man seemed different. I scanned his body language\
  \ looking for clues. \nHe belly-laughed. His eyes lit up and I wasn\u2019t afraid\
  \ anymore. His face was open and honest. How could I not trust Buddha? \n\u201C\
  Dar- ling. You know? It is Cambodia language. Walk - dar, play - ling. Together\
  \ darling. Go for fun.\u201D\n\u201COh. I thought you\u2026\u201D\n\u201CNo. Not\
  \ sweetheart.\u201D His eyes looked straight into mine, then he threw back his head\
  \ and laughed again. \u201CPlease Miss, you ride with me.\u201D\nI hugged my bag\
  \ to my chest. \u201CI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201D \nHe leant closer. \u201CBut\
  \ I don\u2019t know you too.\u201D He was so near I felt the heat of his cheek.\
  \ Sliding forward on the seat, he patted the space behind him. \u201CPlease come.\
  \ Phnom Penh has much to see better than this.\u201D\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, I\u2026\
  \u201D \n\u201CCome,\u201D he said, kick-starting the bike and beckoning me with\
  \ a nod of his head. \u201CI am your guide today. You teach me English, I show you\
  \ my city. It was beautiful before.\u201D\nI took a step towards the bike. \n\u201C\
  Come,\u201D he said, \u201Cdarling.\u201D"
