Text: "While munching on my snacks, I saw him; he was staring at me as if I owed him\
  \ some debt. I tried to ignore him but he made me quite uncomfortable that it became\
  \ impossible for me to cherish my hodophilia. We were travelling to Karachi in a\
  \ same train and this guy with enchanting eyes was sitting next to me. I believe\
  \ I had never seen such alluring eyes as his. \u201CHow can a man have such mesmerizing\
  \ eyes?\u201D I thought to myself and meanwhile the splash of rain on the glass\
  \ of my window diverted my attention away from him and I started looking outside.\
  \ A hot sunny day was dissolving into a fresh rainy evening and the petrichor intoxicated\
  \ my sense of smell. I looked at the man again; he was extremely handsome that his\
  \ physical appearance reminded me of old Greek gods. Peeping out of the window he\
  \ was trying to inhale the rain. \nThe whooshing sound of the train has been aesthetically\
  \ less appreciated but this sound always makes me feel life with more intensity.\
  \ I remember when I was a kid; I used to sit in the balcony of my compact house\
  \ and spent hours waiting for train to come to listen to the sound of its engine.\
  \ I always wanted to travel in a train alone and this was the day when a long awaited\
  \ wish was going to be fulfilled. This was going to be a biggest adventure of my\
  \ life. I was looking outside and feeling the gentle caressing of pure air. It had\
  \ always been a mystery for me as a child how the trees move when you travel but\
  \ the mystery got resolved when I studied the scientific basis for the phenomenon\
  \ in my physics book. I was thinking about the phenomenon and suddenly the train\
  \ stopped on a big platform. Here in Pakistan, the platforms are the perfect spots\
  \ to study the life of a common man. Passengers were hurrying to their train, the\
  \ porters were helping the passengers in lifting their luggage and the tea sellers\
  \ were asking the weary people about refreshment as \u201Cchaye wala chaye wala\u201D\
  . Being a tea lover, I couldn\u2019t resist myself from calling a young guy and\
  \ asked him for a cup of tea. He poured hot cardamom tea in my cup and I started\
  \ appreciating the aroma of tea in my mind. The rain has now stopped and before\
  \ enjoying my tea I asked the beautiful eyed man if he wanted to have some in courtesy\
  \ but he nodded his head smiling and I took a deep breath, I don\u2019t know why\
  \ I felt something unusual. \nAfter having tea I tried to sleep but this unusual\
  \ feeling didn\u2019t let me and I continued staring outside. Suddenly, the man\
  \ took a folded stick from his bag and it was a real shock for me to see a white\
  \ cane. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, he was asking about the way to washroom\
  \ but my tongue was numb and I couldn\u2019t speak a single work. A man sitting\
  \ nearby took him to the washroom and I felt a warm fluid flowing from my eyes."
