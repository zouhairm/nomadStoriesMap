Text: "Gripping the steering wheel with one hand, our driver blasted his horn at the\
  \ bus heading straight for us on the narrow, winding road. While I held my breath,\
  \ the other bus swerved to the inside, passing so close I could admire the nose\
  \ ring on an Indian woman staring out the window. Focusing on her jewelry kept me\
  \ from worrying whether our bus still had all four tires on a road that dropped\
  \ off steeply to the Ganges River below.. Most of us were still jet-lagged from\
  \ the long flight when we piled into two chartered buses for the ride to Govindghat,\
  \ our gateway to the Indian Himalayas. Our goal was to hike to the Valley of the\
  \ Flowers, a UNESCO World Heritage site, & then climb to the world\u2019s highest\
  \ Sikh temple at Hemkund.Reverence for mountains & rivers became apparent as we\
  \ headed north. Alongside the Ganges was a parallel river of young Hindu men, dressed\
  \ in orange & carrying buckets of holy water to their villages, often hundreds of\
  \ miles away. Drinking water from the Ganges with their dying breath, they believed,\
  \ would take their soul to heaven.Spending a night in Rishikesh where the Beatles\
  \ wrote many of their songs & where they introduced the world to transcendental\
  \ meditation. The atmosphere in Rishikesh seemed to have changed since then. Rowdy\
  \ young men on their Ganges pilgrimage made the city seem more like Florida during\
  \ spring break than the yoga capital of the world.\nThe next stop was Govindghat,\
  \ where we left our bus to join Sikh pilgrims on an eight-mile hike Pilgrim in Rishikesh\
  \ to Ghangari comes alive only 4 months a year when the snow has melted enough to\
  \ clear the trail. Porters and mules carried our luggage so we could direct our\
  \ energy to the more than 3,000 ft elevatio. I wondered if I were up to the trek.\
  \ Does\u201CPorters will carry you if you can\u2019t make it up on your own.\u201D\
  \ The idea of being carried up in a basket by a small porter, or even in a sedan\
  \ chair hoisted by 4 men, was enough to keep me trudging up the trail.Arriving at\
  \ our modest hotel, we had to be patient while a bucket of water was heated over\
  \ an open fire and brought to our room. There was no shower, only a drain in the\
  \ bathroom floor. \u201CThis hotel rates a minus one star,\u201D I told my partner\
  \ as we poured dippers of warm water over our heads and took turns drying off with\
  \ the one towel provided. With no Internet or tv, we struggled with electronic withdrawal.\n\
  While the rest of India suffered under sweltering heat & monsoons, the air in the\
  \ mountains was cool, and soft rain watered the flowers while we slept. Up early\
  \ the next morning we Mountains and Flowersheaded toward \u201Cthe place where the\
  \ gods showered flowers on the earth.\u201D That\u2019s what the locals called it.Planting\
  \ walking sticks firmly, we snaked back and forth along the switchbacks. My partner\
  \ was in front with the other touristsi, I spread out along the trail, stopping\
  \ often to catch my breath in the thin mountain air. Only the rush of the Pushpawati\
  \ River below broke the silence. Gone were the incessant honking horns on the road\
  \ to Govindghat and the clatter of mules that carried our luggage up the rocky path\
  \ to Ghangaria. Gone were even the sacred cows, barred from this World Heritage\
  \ Site so they wouldn\u2019t munch on the wildflowers.\nAt nearly 11,500 ft, what\
  \ the guidebooks called a simple 4-mile trek was taking all my energy. Watching\
  \ waterfalls tumble down green velvet hillsides encouraged me to keep putting 1ft\
  \ ahead of the other. Although I had been worried about my partner She seemed least\
  \ bothered by the altitude. When my partner was finding it painful to breathe,one\
  \ of the physicians in our group, returned with altitude sickness medicine, & then\
  \ hurried back to join the others.If we faltered, there was always someone ahead\
  \ on the trail to provide inspiration or someone behind who needed encouragement.\
  \ Young or old, we relied on each other in ways we never would have at home. Together\
  \ we made it up the mountain & back down again."
