Text: "There are many scary things in life. \n\nThere are many scary things about\
  \ travel.\n\nHowever, my scariest leap into the unknown when it came to travelling\
  \ (or in life in general!) wasn't jumping off the edge of a slippery rock into the\
  \ warm Mexican waters below; nor was it jumping onto a train in rural Germany with\
  \ limited directions to find an abandoned hospital. Though these moments were scary,\
  \ my biggest leap into the unknown took place back in the spring of 2017 when I\
  \ stepped into the airport to take me on a flight out of my comfort zone and halfway(ish)\
  \ across the world to Mexico.\n\nI'd never travelled alone before. In fact, bar\
  \ a few summer holidays, I'd never really travelled before full stop. Biting the\
  \ bullet and putting a deposit down for my first time travelling was one of the\
  \ bravest things I'd never done. Why?\n\nBecause I'd never even gotten on a plane\
  \ alone before - and was convinced I'd somehow get lost in the airport and wander\
  \ onto the wrong plane. Because I'd never visited somewhere so different from the\
  \ UK - thick jungles, soft beaches and deep cenotes were things I'd only read about\
  \ in magazines. Because I'd never had to fend for myself - every trip I'd ever been\
  \ on, I'd had a friend or family member there to take over when things went wrong.\
  \ \n\nI think the scariest part of all - other than actually taking the step to\
  \ book it all and go through with the trip - was the idea that it would go well.\
  \ I know that sounds silly, but I was convinced I'd end up being ever so lonely\
  \ away from home or I'd get lost and be too scared to travel again alone. I was\
  \ petrified I'd love the entire experience because if I fell in love with the experience\
  \ of travelling then I'd never want to come back. It would mean a lifetime love\
  \ of travel - saying no to the tradition and suffocating nine to five desk job or\
  \ putting a deposit down on a property to one day start a family.\n\nOf course,\
  \ my fear came true. I fell head over heels in love with the idea of travel. Since\
  \ my Mexican adventure, I've had solo weekend's away in different cities. I've had\
  \ road trips across the vast landscapes of Romania - and, in just a few weeks time,\
  \ I'll be heading to America to explore the West Coast (followed by a three-day\
  \ road trip, of course). \n\nI don't quite know how I've managed to afford it or\
  \ if I'll ever stop. All I know is that by taking that one step - that first leap\
  \ into the unknown - my life has never been the same. I have become a different\
  \ person altogether; a more confident and adventurous version of myself. I work\
  \ harder and budget better - the days may drag by when I am not travelling but I\
  \ know that each paycheck goes towards a new adventure. I have memories to last\
  \ me a lifetime (and even a spontaneous tattoo from Mexico to last me a lifetime\
  \ too!). I have friends all over the world - and I am no longer scared of getting\
  \ lost in an airport.\n\nMy leap into the unknown changed my entire life for the\
  \ better - and I'll never stop being proud of myself for it."
