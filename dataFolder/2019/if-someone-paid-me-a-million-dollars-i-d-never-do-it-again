Text: "Sitting at my work desk on a hot Sunday awaiting the onset of the famous Indian\
  \ summer, reminiscing about my time in the freezing Gundruk region of Nepal, still\
  \ makes me shiver. I wanted to visit Nepal for a while now, primarily for the Himalayas,\
  \ but to also experience a form of spirituality that emerges from this land. I've\
  \ been a Hindu all my life and I had reached my limits with organized religion.\
  \ I wanted to give in and cautiously surrender myself to the mysticism this land\
  \ offers and I did. Landing in Kathmandu, the brisk chill of November made me layer\
  \ up quickly. Kathmandu was beautiful with its ancient architecture,  but the familiarity\
  \ of the pollution and chaos made me want to leave as soon as possible. So the very\
  \ next day, I was on my way to Pokhara, eager to start my hike up the mountains.\
  \ \n\nThe first two days of the ascent and descent were excruciating. Repetitively\
  \ gaining and losing altitude felt like my body weight multiplied every time I took\
  \ a step. Soon enough, I woke up every morning pumped and ready to continue . Halfway\
  \ into my 8-day journey, when I was nearing base camp, there was a sudden surge\
  \ of people returning. We all converged at a shelter as it began snowing and after\
  \ asking around, I found out there had been two avalanches that had completely blocked\
  \ the trail ahead. We were stuck! \n\nWith no other information, I remained calm\
  \ but also felt sad because there was a high possibility that my journey had come\
  \ to an end. I asked a fellow hiker who turned back why he didn't want to chance\
  \ it? He said, \"There's always next year but no second chances to life.\" Those\
  \ words continued to echo in my head but I decided to risk it! I managed to find\
  \ a bed in the dining hall of a fully-occupied lodge that was crowded with stranded\
  \ hikers. I waited in the cold as I surveyed people who braved the avalanche slopes\
  \ returning from base camp. I remember the words of a trek leader who brought her\
  \ group back through the avalanche - \"Even if someone paid me a million dollars,\
  \ I would not do it.\" \n\nCommon sense would make anyone pack up and leave, but\
  \ out of sheer foolishness I stayed on. At 3.15 am, the sky was lit with the brightness\
  \ of the moon, the roaring of the river kept me awake. Adding to the list of possible\
  \ causes of death, being washed away by a freezing river bout 300 feet below was\
  \ one. I walked outside, the night was still, the wind subtle. It felt like this\
  \ was my last night on earth and I tried to enjoy every bit of it. \n\nAt break\
  \ of dawn, I started my walk toward the avalanche. The slope got bigger and scarier.\
  \ Slow and conscious steps and with no snow boots, I was walking with almost bald\
  \ shoes. I noticed the Sherpa's put on their socks over their shoes to get some\
  \ grip and I followed suit. A brilliant hack but still not clear of the danger zone.\
  \ The area I was crossing was a high-risk avalanche zone with boards warning us\
  \ every 100 feet. The snowy path was hard as ice with people treading over it again\
  \ and again, the socks on shoes was doing its best, but here, best wasn't enough.\
  \ There was a 10-feet bridge made of wooden planks. This bridge, although just 10-feet,\
  \ was the toughest thing I ever did. I got down so close to the ground, almost on\
  \ all fours to lower my centre of gravity, knees weak, I looked up to the sky almost\
  \ wishing I was religious, but now was not a time to convert. One step after the\
  \ other, I made it past all the avalanches. Taking my final steps to the base camp,\
  \ I walked up to the signage that read, \"Welcome to Annapurna Base Camp.\" \"Come\
  \ as guests and leave as friends.\" I dropped back first, looked up the sky, as\
  \ snowflakes fell on my face. I had no more wishes to make, I was at peace."
