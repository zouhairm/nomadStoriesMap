Text: "\u201CParakrama\u201D -- Bandula gave me a new Sri Lankan name, as he drove\
  \ us up the Knuckles Mountain near the city of Kandy. Imagine my thrill to be named\
  \ after this great Sinhala king, who unified the whole of ancient Sri Lanka under\
  \ one rule. \n\nThe word \u2018Parakrama\u2019 means courage. This is what kept\
  \ me going on my dream trip to Sri Lanka. I had intended it as a family trip in\
  \ 2018, but my parents refused to come along. The next opportunity came in February\
  \ 2019, but I ended up fracturing my left elbow soon after booking my flights. Strangely,\
  \ the doctor gave me the courage to make the trip.\n\nAnd courage is what Bandula\
  \ displayed that afternoon as he navigated his car on a narrow hill path through\
  \ heavy rains that blinded the view ahead. The conditions were wet and rough. It\
  \ would have been easy to give up on the plan to trek the Knuckles Mountain. Instead,\
  \ Bandula voluntarily started walking with me, which gave me the confidence to complete\
  \ the trek. \n\nLater, the soft-spoken Bandula shared how he had won a tough human\
  \ rights case against his former employer in the Middle East before returning to\
  \ his homeland Sri Lanka. It left me wondering what gave people like Bandula such\
  \ mental strength.\n\nAlong the way, I met some foreign tourists whose travels in\
  \ Sri Lanka helped them accomplish a life goal, overcome a fear, or live their passion.\
  \ A German girl I met in Colombo told me that by volunteering in Sri Lanka she proved\
  \ to her family that she could stay independently outside Europe. A Norwegian lady\
  \ I sat with on a train to Nuwara Eliya said that living in Sri Lanka encouraged\
  \ her to follow her dream of working as a turtle conservationist. \n\nA young French\
  \ couple I chatted with in the tea gardens of Ella were grateful that Sri Lanka\
  \ inspired them to plan their first ever family trip with their kids. An elderly\
  \ English man I stumbled upon while strolling through Horton Plains said that Sri\
  \ Lanka provided a great opportunity for him to spend quality time with his wife.\n\
  \nMy own \u2018aha\u2019 moment happened at Kataragama, an ancient temple complex\
  \ revered by Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and indigenous tribes. Experiencing a prayer\
  \ ceremony here opened my mind to the possibility of world peace through a confluence\
  \ of religions.\n\nHistory reveals that the path to peace requires great courage.\
  \ After a long-fought war, the Indian king Ashoka renounced violence and sent his\
  \ daughter Sanghamitra to Sri Lanka to spread Buddhism.\n\nIn those days, for a\
  \ woman to undertake an arduous journey by sea was a miracle. She brought with her\
  \ a branch of the Bodhi Tree under which Buddha himself had attained enlightenment.\
  \ \n\nThat branch has since grown into the oldest Bodhi Tree in Sri Lanka in the\
  \ city of Anuradhapura. People from across the world come there just to bow down\
  \ before the tree. As I joined them in their quiet walk round the tree, I could\
  \ feel their determination to follow the path of Buddha. \n\nIt is said that Buddha\
  \ himself visited Sri Lanka three times. I must confess -- my first trip to Sri\
  \ Lanka was to tick off a bucket list. But, Sri Lanka as a country is far too culturally\
  \ rich and naturally beautiful to experience in a single visit.\n\nSo, what might\
  \ inspire my second visit to Sri Lanka? A Chinese traveller told me that he came\
  \ to Sri Lanka to escape the crowded cities in China. Coming from India, this could\
  \ be a perfect excuse for me as well. A Swedish couple I met on my flight to Colombo\
  \ said they came to Sri Lanka just to relax on the gorgeous beaches. Being a sea\
  \ lover, even I would jump at such an opportunity.\n\nOne person I fondly remember\
  \ meeting in Sri Lanka is the Santa Claus of Finland. Yes, you heard this right.\
  \ This now-retired Finnish gentleman is actually paid by his country\u2019s airlines\
  \ to be a brand ambassador by dressing up as Santa Claus.\n\nWith my new Sri Lankan\
  \ name, Bandula might fancy my chances of dressing up as the great Sinhala king\
  \ Parakrama."
