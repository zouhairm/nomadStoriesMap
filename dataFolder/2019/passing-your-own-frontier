Text: "Those were days when the fear involved my thoughts cause I knew that everybody\
  \ is going to ask the same thing that my unconscious was yelling me: what the hell\
  \ are you going to do there?!. \nBut anyway I traveled to Erbil, the old city that\
  \ once was the capital of Kurdistan, and now is just another city of Iraq. What\
  \ brought me there was a job contract us a musician in a 5 stars hotel. I just appeared\
  \ by these land because of that, and all my attention was that at only 30 minutes\
  \ from my residence the Isis, that one that made many countries tremble with their\
  \ terrorist acts, had their base; so yes the question have sense. Even some of the\
  \ Kurdish wish I talked just a few words, asked me the same every time they knew\
  \ that I\u2019m an foreigner. And guess what...I did not regret the moments I spend\
  \ there, my experience was so far from my first thought that I just wanted to make\
  \ you know about the kindness I found there, every person around me and my partners\
  \ put the best of them to make us feel like at home, \nEven though the country have\
  \ a beautiful natural places, with transparents rivers, mountains...things that\
  \ I enjoy, this doesn\u2019t impact me that much like the way they live. Just a\
  \ few years ago the economy of the city was growing because of the petroleum industry\
  \ that was developing in their area, there for knew places for the tourism entertainment\
  \ were opening, so some foreign companies brought people of many countries to work.\
  \ \nIs very well known that almost all the countries that speak Arabic language\
  \ have a strong rules, but more than that is the practice of Muslim\u2019s religion,\
  \ who makes their habits stronger to follow. But somehow they found the way to cohexist\
  \ with all this changes the country was going through in just a few years, and step\
  \ by step get closer to us and have a nice conversation with a woman like me that\
  \ doesn\u2019t wair to much cloth in front of them and trated me with respect, and\
  \ open their houses and their families to us, offering us the most succulents plates\
  \ made with love and gratitude just for being ourselves and brought a bit of music\
  \ to their lives. \nKurdish people have also practicants of the cristianism, who\
  \ celebrate all the holidays like Christmas and so. The christians occupied a part\
  \ of the city and the Muslim the another one. So you\u2019ll have many celebrations\
  \ through the year. When the Ramadan comes the whole month at night they have food\
  \ festivities, and when the sun goes out stop taking any food till the sunset again.\
  \ The way to have fun for almost all the habitants there are big diversions parks,\
  \ with amazing devices. The ice creams I tried there, can\u2019t explain you...my\
  \ mouth melts just to think in those combination of flavors that I use to choose,\
  \ the fruits ones are my preferred and they have all kind of colorful and tastes\
  \ fruits, in an especial machine the man in charge of it makes you the ice cream\
  \ by orther just in front of you, you enjoy the process and for the kids he makes\
  \ juggles with it before giving to them. \nAt this point you must being asking yourself:\
  \ well what about the war and all this, just to tell you in one occation I listened\
  \ sounds like machine  guns-shots, my friend wanted to see through the window and\
  \ I did not let her do it, instead of that I push her to the bathroom and tell her\
  \ stay down please, we just went out when all come back to the calm, then we walked\
  \ out of the room very afraid, to ask for some information about what just happened,\
  \ everybody laughed of us... that sounds were fireworks and we missed hahaha.\n\
  Yes...the world is a surprise, in the same country that this huge conflict, that\
  \ by the way was really happening, we lived a normal life, I confirmed that being\
  \ afraid can make you avoid incredibly experience in your life, so just leap into\
  \ the unknown."
