Text: "Monica parts the webbing of my mosquito net and the blinding East-African sun\
  \ hits her face in such a way that I understand why we compare beauty to sunlight.\
  \ \n\t\u201CIt\u2019s time to do your laundry\u201D she says, and quickly turns\
  \ away. Do I detect amusement in her voice? I throw on the cleanest clothing I can\
  \ find, grab my laundry bag, and pad off behind her, my rubber flip-flops loudly\
  \ smacking against the cement floor. Monica is my partner in a six-month cultural\
  \ exchange program, and we are one week into our orientation in Mwika, Tanzania,\
  \ a small village at the base of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Monica has lived in Tanzania for\
  \ most of her life, but I have been transported into a new world. \n\tThe aroma\
  \ of chapati and french fries lay thick upon the air. Women dress in bold, geometric\
  \ prints and cover their heads and lips in fuchsia. People speak with each other,\
  \ laugh with each other and touch each other. Laughter looks different. It reverberates\
  \ deep from the belly, heads are thrown back, and people howl with joy! Everyone\
  \ smiles with their teeth. Children weave in and out of laundry lines and race each\
  \ other through alleys and side streets. Dala dala conductors shout their routes\
  \ to passerby and thirty or more people cram into the space of a minivan, dive through\
  \ windows and perch on their toes. Community is as inevitable as it is necessary.\
  \ \n\tMonica has been patient with me as I revel in the beauty of the snow-peaked\
  \ mountain and touch all of the fabrics in the marketplace, but this morning, her\
  \ swinging arms and pursed lips tell me my lessons are about to begin. She brings\
  \ out two buckets and fills them with water from the well, dropping a packet of\
  \ powdered soap into the first. Plunging my whole arm into the cold, soapy water,\
  \ I grab at items of clothing, wring them out repeatedly, and dip them into the\
  \ second bucket to rinse them off. Soon, my buckets are nearly empty and black with\
  \ dirt. Monica is next to me, expertly doing her own wash in full, pristine buckets\
  \ of water. \n\t\u201CCan I grab some more water?\u201D I am sheepish. \n\t\u201C\
  Not if you also want to shower.\u201D She is reproachful. \n\tIt hadn\u2019t occurred\
  \ to me that there was a limit to the water I could take. I string up my still-saturated\
  \ laundry, fill a shower bucket, and lug it to the bathroom, leaving pools of water\
  \ in my wake. The bathroom has a slanted, cement floor with a hole that acts as\
  \ both toilet and drain. I undress, squat before the bucket, and submerge my head\
  \ in the already tepid water. A lizard zips across the floor in front of me. Grabbing\
  \ for a bottle of shampoo, I lather up my head generously and scoop up water with\
  \ my hands to rinse it off. Shampoo still drips from my scalp when the last of the\
  \ water is gone. \n\tI leave the bathroom soapy and defeated, and find Monica on\
  \ her hands and knees, pushing a sopping towel along the hallway, mopping up an\
  \ inch of water in the hallway. I have flooded the entire second floor! I run out\
  \ to the line to grab my clothing. My half-washed sundress audibly crunches with\
  \ dried soap as I help clean the flooded hall. Monica laughs at me kindly, and I\
  \ wonder how ridiculous she must think I am if the loss of a washing machine and\
  \ shower has rendered me this useless. After all, I have seen children half my size\
  \ balance tubs of water on their heads under a blazing tomato sun.\n\tIn the first\
  \ weeks I spent in Tanzania, these small lessons in privilege were hard to swallow.\
  \ In time though, I learned that doing laundry together carves out precious time\
  \ to spend with loved ones. I eventually got better at showering with the bucket,\
  \ and it taught me to be more intentional about the time I spent with myself, too.\
  \ After all, finding yourself is not about hopping on an airplane, it\u2019s about\
  \ throwing yourself into the experience of your one beautiful life\u2014mess and\
  \ all."
