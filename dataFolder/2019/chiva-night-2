Text: "The evening air of Santa Marta hung warm and thick.  Three chivas, traditional\
  \ farm transport turned Colombian party bus, were waiting in the parking lot. With\
  \ their garish paint jobs and purple and green strobe lights, they looked more traveling\
  \ carnies than mobile discos.  We were a group of nine middle aged Philadelphians\
  \ who came to Colombia sharing only our devotion to Elizabeth, our Cale\xF1o Spanish\
  \ teacher. \n\nOur destination was Playa Rondadero, Santa Marta\u2019s beach, where,\
  \ we were told, there would be music and dancing. It was Fat Tuesday, the last night\
  \ of Carnaval.  Visions of a beach pulsating with throngs of white-clad Colombians\
  \ dancing cumbia filled our minds.\n\nRubiella, our local guide, led us to one of\
  \ the chivas. Our driver appeared with a cooler of beer and water, then disappeared.\
  \ The two other chivas took off into the night. A wizened woman walked by carrying\
  \ a tray of beer on her head for sale.  We drank beer. We waited. The driver returned\
  \ to switch on some loud dance music and vanished again.  Energized with anticipation,\
  \ we started dancing in the cramped aisles.  \n\nAfter an hour, a group of young\
  \ Colombians joined our bus, drinks in hand.  The chiva finally chugged out of the\
  \ parking lot around 9PM. The music accelerated and the Colombians sang and waved\
  \ and moved rhythmically in the back. A young man with a shaved head and tight shirt\
  \ leapt to the back of the chiva and motioned us all to dance while humping the\
  \ seat backs.  \n\nWe drove slowly through the streets of Santa Marta, music blaring\
  \ with hip-hop and reggaeton and Latin pop.  The Colombians were shouting the words\
  \ with the lively familiarity of a family wedding. We stopped at a gated liquor\
  \ store to buy booze.  We stopped to take selfies wearing curly yellow Carlos Valderrama\
  \ wigs next to an outsize statue of the Colombian Pel\xE9.  \n\nThe chiva meandered\
  \ through Santa Marta as the music grew louder. The smell of diesel permeated the\
  \ humid air. The Colombians were still animated while the Americans began to fade.\
  \ The promised Carnaval was nowhere in sight.  Elizabeth, who prefers Chopin to\
  \ Pitbull, had paled from the din and the fumes, looking like a china doll in distress.\
  \ The rest of the us smiled gamely. \n\nAround 10:30 the chiva stopped downtown.\
  \ The Colombians descended, disappearing to buy food. We lingered along the busy\
  \ malec\xF3n, enduring what one of the many inexplicable pauses on this trip, understood\
  \ only by our guides. My friend Cathy pointed to a taxi and said \u201Cwe could\
  \ escape now\u201D. But we stayed. The Colombians returned and the chiva carried\
  \ us through increasingly poorer neighborhoods of Santa Marta.\n\nThe chiva pulled\
  \ into un unlit parking lot behind an apartment building. \u201CLlegamos a la playa!\u201D\
  \ exclaimed Rubiella.  We had reached the beach, two hours after we had left.\n\n\
  The beach was dark and deserted, illuminated mostly by the green neon of restaurant\
  \ signs across the street. Scattered groups of young people stood nearby. There\
  \ was a faint smell of marijuana in the air but no throngs, no music, no Carnaval.\n\
  \nRubiella led us to an open patch of beach under a dim street light.  A few bright\
  \ red plastic chairs had been arranged as if in a prayer circle.  She motioned to\
  \ us to sit and a singer, a drummer, an accordion player, and a percussionist with\
  \ a guacharaca materialized into the circle.\n\nThe men began to play vallenato,\
  \ the traditional music of troubadors, the improvisational griot  of Colombia. As\
  \ the singer cast his ballads across the night air, Elizabeth\u2019s face began\
  \ to glow. She stood up, sang along, and began to sway to the music. A skinny man\
  \ in loose white clothes came over to dance with her, hips rolling and hands circling.\
  \ Rubiella beamed.\n\nWe sat on the beach in our plastic chair circle for another\
  \ hour, as the vallenato music floated across the sand and toward the Caribbean\
  \ Sea, watching Elizabeth smile.  We danced and clapped. The two hours on the chiva\
  \ faded into the past. The ride had been the prelude to this, the blessing of a\
  \ Colombian folk tradition on an empty beach. The Colombia of Elizabeth\u2019s memory."
