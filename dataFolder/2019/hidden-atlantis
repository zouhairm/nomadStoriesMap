Text: "Before I came to Sulawesi, Indonesia, I knew it mainly for their good food\
  \ and blistering hot weather. Now I will remember for its colorful rocks and their\
  \ beautiful white sanded beaches lay soround the unique shape of the island. There\
  \ are legends that states sulawesi island was submerged under water long time ago\
  \ and re appear after natural disaster occur in the past. Which explained a lot\
  \ of beautiful coral and other porous rock spread across the whole island. Despite\
  \ its obvious uniqueness and natural charm of the place, not many people have made\
  \ sulawesi their destination.\n\nLanding on Luwuk, city on the center of Sulawesi,\
  \ I spend my first day with 7 hours\u2019 car ride to remote city Taronggo and welcomed\
  \ with traditional ceremony with local people. The ceremony is a unique welcoming\
  \ party where each of us are asked to smoke corn husk filled with dried tobacco\
  \ leaves lead by the head of the Wane Posangke tribe while he pray, and closes with\
  \ belly filling dinner with its local menu called Papeda. Papeda is white starch\
  \ porridge that has gooey texture and taste bland, ate with yellow fish soup as\
  \ its companion to enhances the flavor.\n\nThe next day, we trekked through remote\
  \ portion of the Wana Posangke. Lead by a local woman named Indo Imel, indo means\
  \ mom and Imel is the name of her first chicken. I asked her how does she named\
  \ after her chicken name, she sat back to ponder the question, \u201Cits the culture\
  \ of the tribe to call adult based on their fist foster care, in my case its chicken.\
  \ I also didn\u2019t understand that conception at first until I was being called\
  \ after my chicken name\u201D explained Indo Imel with her laugh follows. On the\
  \ way to the destination I took a deep breath for a closer look at flying butterfly\
  \ with bright colors above corals in a crystal clear river. As I observed, there\
  \ are a lot of small coral around the river with the gigantic piece embedded on\
  \ the surface of hill range around the river. With a lot of porous coral rock around\
  \ the hills, that definitely makes us easier to climb up The hill despite it leaves\
  \ a lot of tiny scratches mark because of its sharp edges. After having a long walk\
  \ across rain forest, and river it\u2019s tempting to soak a bit on the shallow\
  \ side of the river to release the heat. Surrounded by river around the village,\
  \ our destination is just around the corner.\n\nI arrive just in time for the chocolate\
  \ harvesting season. Most of the member of the tribe is chocolate and coffee farmers.\
  \ Every year they celebrate the harvesting season with festivities of music, beer\
  \ and fireworks to give thanks for the prosperity god has given them. We spent 3\
  \ days learning a little bit of their nomadic lifestyle and explore its natural\
  \ surrounding.  On our last day Appa Nelce, one of the leader of the tribe, lead\
  \ us to the what he called \u201Chidden waterfall\u201D on the middle of the forest.\
  \ leaded by Appa Nelce, we got excited and asked how far is it from the lodge, and\
  \ its 30 minutes walk \u201Cslowly\u201D he said. After 10 minutes, me and my other\
  \ 5 friends just realize that we are about 20 meters apart from Appa Nelce, this\
  \ is the first time I got a tour guide that his walk is my speed of run. We ended\
  \ up chasing Appa Nelce in the middle of forest and suddenly I fell down and broke\
  \ my slipper caused me to walk the slowest among the group. As we arrive on the\
  \ waterfall, I was mesmerized by the sight. A stack of small lagoon side by side\
  \ with the big lagoon on the center radiate beautiful green color hugged with lush\
  \ tropical trees and bushes around. After few minutes feeling the calming vibe with\
  \ the sound of water descended from one lagoon to another below, I sat on one giant\
  \ rock to enhance the experience of the hidden Atlantis."
