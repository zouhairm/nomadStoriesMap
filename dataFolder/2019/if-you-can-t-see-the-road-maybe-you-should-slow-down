Text: "The road out of Coober Pedy shouldn\u2019t even be called a road. Sepia rocks\
  \ and more sepia rocks plus a load of dust spitting out under the tires of the convoy\
  \ in front of us as we headed to the Painted Desert. The faint tracks were only\
  \ marked by the mounds of dirt on each side, like the piles a snowplow makes back\
  \ home after a heavy fall. Nothing in front and nothing behind. Nothing to the left\
  \ and nothing to the right. Just loads of dust and a haze over the horizon, the\
  \ hills rusty clouds beyond our reach. Each abandoned vehicle we passed whispered\
  \ to us of the adventure and danger of a place like this. Some said this place was\
  \ uninhabitable. My first instinct was to take that challenge.\n \nI squinted into\
  \ the nothingness and pretended that Sofus and I were speeding along in Mad Max.\
  \ Even in the sweltering heat we didn\u2019t turn on the A/C. Sofus stayed slow\
  \ and far back from Dean\u2019s SUV as the dust spread an invisible cloak over everything\
  \ and seeped into the car. I belted out songs, wishing I\u2019d had a pair of those\
  \ steampunk goggles, and he focused on where the road should be.\n\nPerhaps it was\
  \ a slight corner too quick, but it must have taken just three seconds. Three seconds\
  \ for banging and spinning and flipping and landing and upside down and how did\
  \ we get there and where did those seconds go? \n \t\u201CAlina!\u201D Sofus called,\
  \ panic stricken and moaning. \u201CAlina! Are you all right? Alina!\u201D\n   \
  \      And I am. I think. I don\u2019t know. Everything is disjointed and cracked\
  \ and hazy and confused and I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong, but I do,\
  \ but this only happens in the movies and what happened, and what might be wrong\
  \ and I didn\u2019t renew my travel insurance and the car might blow up.\n\nThe\
  \ car might blow up.\n\nI must have unbuckled my seat belt but I don\u2019t remember.\
  \ I must have crawled through the broken window but I don\u2019t remember. I do\
  \ remember trying to stand but my knees were wonky and weak and I was a camel, up\
  \ and down up and down while my brain thudded out of my skull. What was wrong with\
  \ me?\n          And there was Sofus. He staggered up beside me with a shock of\
  \ red in a streak down his face. \u201CAre you all right?\u201D He put his hands\
  \ on my shoulders with a tortured scared face. \u201CI\u2019m so sorry so so sorry.\u201D\
  \n          We hug close and hard. \u201CWe\u2019re all right,\u201D I said. \u201C\
  Are you? Just a headache. What happened?\u201D\n          He\u2019s a frightened\
  \ child about to explode. A big pale red baby. \u201CI think my back tire caught.\
  \ It was so hard to see. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201D\n          I took him around the\
  \ waist and sat with him, his broad shoulders tight over mine.\n          He hyperventilated\
  \ and cried and all I could do was rub his back and say \u201Cdeep breath in, deep\
  \ breath out. Deep breath in. Deep breath out.\u201D We breathed and I blathered\
  \ for what felt like hours.\n          \u201CWe\u2019re okay,\u201D I said. \u201C\
  They\u2019ll be back soon. We survived. All will be well.\u201D I believed it but\
  \ I understood why he didn\u2019t. I stroked and kissed his forehead and repeated\
  \ the mantra and watched the horizon for signs of them. Nothing to the left, nothing\
  \ to the right, nothing in front, and nothing behind. Where were they?\n\nFinally,\
  \ a car appeared. But it was coming from the wrong direction. I looked both ways.\
  \ Where were we headed?\n          It slowed and the five of them got out of the\
  \ SUV where yesterday I was riding shotgun. A dirty group of travellers gathered\
  \ \u2018down under\u2019. They stared out at this disaster scene with quiet faces.\
  \ This was not the plan.  \n          Kendall hugged Sofus as he cried. She then\
  \ came to me, her long arms outstretched and I felt a weight lift.\n          Kangaroos\
  \ appeared in the distance and skinny cows came to investigate. The sun\u2019s burning\
  \ rays faded, leaving us halted there amidst the detritus of broken food, goon bags,\
  \ warped stoves, and newly stranded wreck, in a world that some people said was\
  \ uninhabitable."
