Text: "Could you do it? Get naked with strangers? Worse: get naked with folks you\
  \ KNOW? Colleagues? Friends you know from church? Your children? Maybe your own\
  \ mother-in-law?\n    As a not-unusual very-private American female, I consciously\
  \ and painfully choose clothes to hide body flaws. Choosing a swimsuit is an hours-long\
  \ ordeal. Now, I would risk offending my generous Finnish hosts if I declined to\
  \ participate in a ritual ubiquitous to the Finnish culture \u2013 the sauna.\n\
  \    Riita and Tuula invited me to a rural sauna club (members who don\u2019t have\
  \ home saunas join such a club) in the verdant countryside outside Helsinki. If\
  \ nobody\u2019s at the communal club but you, you\u2019ll have to build the fire\
  \ in the sauna. It takes a lot of labor and hours to prepare, even if the caretakers\
  \ have left chopped wood for you. Aside from the sauna, there is a large building\
  \ holding 20-40 bunk beds and you bring your own sleeping bag.\n   There are just\
  \ five million Finns, yet three million saunas in the country. You will find saunas\
  \ in individual apartments. In homes. In corporate businesses.  At the Finns\u2019\
  \ private summer cottages \u201Cin the nature.\u201D In exclusive membership-only\
  \ sauna clubs. On cruise ships and ferries on the Baltic Sea. In the basement of\
  \ the Finnish Embassy in Washington, D.C. The sauna ritual permeates Finnish culture.\
  \ \n    Sauna (pronounced \u201CSOW-nah\u201D) is the great democratizer. No titles\
  \ are used. And though everyone\u2019s naked, don\u2019t picture a sleazy sex club.\
  \ Former Finnish President Tarja Halonen once said in a TV interview that it was\
  \ unfair politically, when men and women had separate saunas in the Parliament.\
  \ Since men dominated the Parliament, women were often shut out of far-reaching\
  \ political discussions. Business is conducted in the saunas like Americans on a\
  \ golf course.\n    How serious is the sauna in Finland? Marjatta gave up room for\
  \ a washer/dryer to install a sauna in her city apartment. Juhanne and Anneli, a\
  \ married couple, built their sauna house two years before they built their summer\
  \ cottage on their lake-front property. It\u2019s been told that the Finns who joined\
  \ the French Foreign Legion many decades ago built saunas in the desert. Sports\
  \ teams will build tent saunas at tournament events. \n    Here is the sequence\
  \ of an authentic Finnish sauna. You wash thoroughly. Enter the hot sauna (150-250\
  \ degrees Fahrenheit.) Pour water on the hot stones to create l\xF6yly (wet steam.)\
  \ Often, one cuts a bundle of leafy birch branches to whip oneself while in the\
  \ sauna. It brings blood to the surface of your skin and increases circulation.\
  \ Next, beet red and approaching deathly heat stroke, you exit to cool down by sitting\
  \ on the porch in the cold, jumping into the lake, rolling in the snow, or inserting\
  \ yourself into a hole in the ice of a frozen lake (I did each of these at different\
  \ saunas). Return to sauna. Cool down. Have beer. Grill sausages and eat.  Return\
  \ to sauna. Cool down. Have beer. Repeat cycle at least three times.\n    So, back\
  \ to the woods for my first sauna. Tuula was naked, sandals only, a small miner\u2019\
  s light on her forehead, navigating the now-dark forest, a wooden bucket in each\
  \ hand that she had just filled from the lake, laboriously balancing on stepping\
  \ stones as she hauled fresh water to the sauna. Naked. Dark. Light on head. Balancing\
  \ buckets of water. It was like unexpectedly running into a wood sprite. \n    There\
  \ were many saunas I made acquaintance with during my year in Finland, including\
  \ a large wood smoke sauna, with no chimney. The experience was preceded by a wood\
  \ steam sauna and jumping into a hole cut in the ice. One is forbidden from wearing\
  \ swimsuits since it\u2019s believed the suits hold in the impurities that the sauna\
  \ sweats out of you.\n    A young college exchange student had been anxious for\
  \ the sauna experience, so I was bewildered to see him fully-clothed, sitting it\
  \ out alone in the bar of a sauna club, and I had to inquire.  In his highly-injured\
  \ British cadence, he answered, \u201CThey wanted me to take me trousers off!\u201D\
  \n    Ah, well, Tommy. You missed an experience."
