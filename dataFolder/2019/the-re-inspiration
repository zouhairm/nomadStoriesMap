Text: "For quite some time I felt uninspired to create content. Perhaps it was the\
  \ overly saturated and heavily repetitive photos on Instagram, or maybe it was the\
  \ overwhelming pressure to constantly create as opposed to just enjoying the scenery.\
  \ Either way, I was in a bit of a rut and didn\u2019t want to write or shoot as\
  \ much. \nThen I planned a solo trip to India which I was looking forward to but\
  \ still didn\u2019t have much of a desire to create. \nIt wasn\u2019t until I landed\
  \ in delhi (a 15 hour flight), drove to Agra ( a 3 hour drive) and arrived at the\
  \ Taj Mahal that I experienced a magical wake up call. \nNow I\u2019ve heard about\
  \ the hype of the Taj Mahal, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be pure perfection.\
  \ The intricate designs blew me away. The perfectly symmetrical building had me\
  \ in awe as I walked the grounds for almost 4 hours. This place alone inspired me\
  \ to want to create again. I said to myself \u201Cif these people can create something\
  \ so beautiful with no technology or fancy instruments, then there\u2019s no reason\
  \ why I can\u2019t do the same\u201D. \nThe rest of my trip to India was purely\
  \ magical. All the palaces and Havelis had me saying \u201Cwow\u201D very 4 minutes!\
  \ I would walk up to some of the temples and touch them and ask myself \u201CHow\
  \ did they even make this?\u201D \nWhile I was in India, my inspiration not only\
  \ kicked in but it went in over time. I started shooting a lot more and my writing\
  \ improved drastically. I actually believe my best work was done in India. Since\
  \ I\u2019ve returned, I\u2019m  now I\u2019m on a mission to keep up this momentum\
  \ for the rest of my travels."
