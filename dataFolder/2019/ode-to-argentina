Text: "It only took five minutes for me to realize that dark skinned women are a rarity\
  \ in Buenos Aires. As I stood in admiration of the architecture, my eyes met a handsome\
  \ man with white hair, staring straight into my eyes. \nI gave him a smirk and looked\
  \ away. \n\nMy eyes met another man. And then a woman. I turned around slightly\
  \ frantic to realize there were about 5-6 people staring at me; almost in awe. \n\
  \nJust as I was about to start questioning whether or not I was delirious, our guide\
  \ Luis came to me with a huge smile. \n\n\u201CThey are  looking at your skin,\u201D\
  \ he said. His heavy Argentinian accent had become a love language to us all. \n\
  \n\u201CMy skin?\u201D I was slightly confused because growing up with dark skin\
  \ in America was like growing up with a \u201Ctease me\u201D sign on your back.\n\
  \n\u201CYes, your skin is dark and beautiful. Take it as a compliment.\u201D\n\n\
  I smiled, soaking in the admiration a bit longer while gaining much needed confidence\
  \ in my healthy dose of melanin. \n\nA little girl ran up to me with trinkets and\
  \ cigarettes in hand. She began to show me all of her inventory, asking for money\
  \ in return. \n\n\u201CNo thank you,\u201D I said and then realized she may not\
  \ be able to understand English. \n\n\u201CNo..No quiero.\u201D \n\nShe moved on\
  \ to the next potential customer without batting an eye. She was used to the dismissal.\
  \ A tiny bit of guilt set in and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why a five-ish\
  \ year old girl was outside, in the middle of the day selling cigarettes. \n   \
  \                                                                        \nThat\
  \ evening we passed through beautiful mountains and valleys with burnt orange rocks\
  \ and streams with running water. I listened to the sounds of India Arie and relished\
  \ that I was far beyond the street lights of Smyrna,GA. \n\nWe arrived to a large\
  \ home about two hours away from Buenos Aires. A small but stocky man walked towards\
  \ us wearing a cowboy hat, boots, a button up and ripped jeans. His land was decorated\
  \ with horses, open grass and a llama standing on the porch in the same way the\
  \ dogs in Homeward Bound sat waiting on their family to come home. \n\nFor dinner,\
  \ we sat down at the table to homemade potatoes, steak, and green vegetables grown\
  \ from their fresh garden in the backyard. The stocky man was named Fido. Him and\
  \ his wife Maria had been living on that land for 30 years selling woven items and\
  \ farming their own food. \n\nAfter dinner, we took turns teaching each other dances\
  \ from our home countries. Fido, Luis and Maria taught us how to meringue and I\
  \ led the entire group in a lesson featuring the Electric Slide. \n\nOur mouths\
  \ fresh with wine, we danced until we could barely stand. The energy in the room\
  \ felt pure, as every face was wearing an authentically genuine smile. \n\nAs I\
  \ walked outside to catch fresh air, I was instantly taken by the scene before me.\
  \ We had driven so far up the mountain, that we were face to face with the nights\
  \ sky. Thousands of bright stars stared back at me and all I could do was marvel\
  \ at their existence. \n\nWithin minutes, Luis walked up next to me. \u201CWooo\
  \ Natasha! Are they dancing like that in America? I need to come and visit you there\
  \ so you can teach me more of the dancing.\u201D \nI laughed and said \u201CI would\
  \ absolutely love that Luis.\u201D\n\n  .\t.\t.\n\nNine months later, on a cold\
  \ January night, I was back home, headed out to a show when I got a message from\
  \ Luis\u2019 nephew, letting me know Luis had a sudden heart attack and passed away.\
  \ \n\nI sat down in heartbreak. Luis and I had spent several nights in the previous\
  \ months on Skype; talking about our time in Argentina, personal stories and his\
  \ eventual trip to the States.  \n\nWhile the news of his passing is painful, all\
  \ I can do is smile when I think of him. Recounting our memories and hoping that\
  \ one day, somewhere in Heaven, I can find him again, and teach him more of the\
  \ dancing."
