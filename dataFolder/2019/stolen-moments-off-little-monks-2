Text: "'Please offer prayers for my father's soul,' saying that, I handed few rupees\
  \ to Phurba, promised to visit him again, and hugged him loosely from the corner\
  \ of my right arm, maintaining a respectful distance. \nPhurba took those crumpled\
  \ notes, coyly nodded, blushing red.  \nAfter a second of eye contact, I quickly\
  \ turned to take the city route. To only turn once, to have a glance of Phurba and\
  \ his friend rushing to attend their evening lessons on Buddhist scriptures, followed\
  \ by offering prayers for those sick and departed. \nPhurba, only 15, but wise beyond\
  \ his age, was offered to the Monastery at the age of 5, by his Buddhist family,\
  \ as per the tradition. Blushing, he confessed that he misses the \"normal\" life,\
  \ being with his siblings. However, he considers himself lucky to have been chosen\
  \ for this holy path to serve the Takstang Monastery. \nTaktsang, basks in the glory\
  \ of being the 'holiest' of all the monasteries in Bhutan. No doubt, most popular\
  \ for tourists, for its surreal facade.\nAn official, guarding visitors shared that,\
  \ the monastery  was built \"piece by piece\" by bhutanese-locals who worshipped\
  \ the Guru, believed to have leaped onto the rocky hills, seated on the Tiger. And\
  \ to ward off the evil spirits, meditated in the dark crevices of the rocks. Those\
  \ faithful, sense the vibrating energy of the Holy protective Spirit of the Guru,\
  \ I was told. \nAfter an hour of bowing to almost all the energy depicting figurines,\
  \ in separate chambers, I walked out of the Monastery with a sense of incomplete-ness:\
  \ like an unfinished conversation with a Lover.  \nFew meters ahead, I saw little\
  \ monks coyly denying offerings of sweets from tourists. Upon asking them, in a\
  \ local dialect if there are ideal spaces to pitch tents, they collectively responded\
  \ with an enthusiastic, YES! And clambered for my heavy bag, and took me to their\
  \ residential school on the other end of the hill. \nAn hour after sunrise, I woke\
  \ up to chattering, around my tent. They were curious if I had heard a nocturnal.\
  \ I had heard one and shivered to sleep, but didn't want to engage in fear and complains.\
  \ After all, the caretaker monk had made a huge fire to keep me safe and warm, on\
  \ my insistence to sleep outside, upon his repeated requests. \nAround midday, after\
  \ lunch from offerings of noodles, rice, cheese, and dried beef,  Phurba, having\
  \ got the permission to guide me to Bumdrak, handed me a cane stick, tucked a steely\
  \ knife in his garment, while narrating few stories. On the way, he pointed towards\
  \ an abandoned house, that was very recently scavenged by a wild bear, mauling to\
  \ almost death of a young resident.\n\nBefore we set afoot on the isolated trek,\
  \ we took little rest in the meditation centre en route. \"After three years of\
  \ rigorous meditation, they are promoted to the status of a Guru/revered monk, appointed\
  \ as caretaker of monasteries, and initiate young boys into monkhood,\" informed\
  \ Phurba. \n\nWe reached Bumdrak Monastery. It was late afternoon, few hours before\
  \ sunset. The view was surreal: clouds, sun, folding hills and paro valley. \nThe\
  \ Caretaker monk, offered us warm tea and sat us down for a chat and quick tour.\
  \ After about 20 minutes, sensing the setting darkness, hurriedly packed biscuits,\
  \ and a bottle to fetch water from the holy spring flowing through the crevices\
  \ of the rocky hills. The mouth of the stream is a resting place of a lady spirit:\
  \ Daikini; protecting the source of water in Bhutan, informed Phurba. \n\nIt was\
  \ few minutes before night sky fell, I spotted the caretaker monk perched in the\
  \ window with a conch to blow. \nUpon hearing the sound of conch reverberating in\
  \ the silent hill, like an imagined premonition, we ran downhills. \nPhurba being\
  \ a fearless guide, gave me few lessons on a gutty bellow, he picked from older\
  \ monks, to scare off nocturnals. After few failed attempts,  we continued bellowing,\
  \ synchronising our hurried steps with glittering lime stones that paved our way.\n\
  That Night, Phurba and I, stole the show from the bears and fireflies; those stars\
  \ of the dark nights in the silent hills of Bumdrak Valley."
