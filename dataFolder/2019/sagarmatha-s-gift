Text: "Ama Dablam dominates the cloudless blue skies above, its prominent peak stealing\
  \ the show even as the trail winding through the vast green countryside reveals\
  \ the first, distant glimpse of Sagarmatha, the Goddess of the Sky and the mountain\
  \ otherwise known as Everest by the Western world. It\u2019s day three on the trek\
  \ to Everest Base Camp, and our team steps off the trail for a midday break, gathering\
  \ on the grassy knolls away from the warning clang of yak bells. We\u2019ve yet\
  \ to reach the most physically challenging days on the mountain, and the mood is\
  \ lighthearted as we settle down with snacks, the crew breaking into a hearty rendition\
  \ of a traditional Nepali song.\n\nTogether, we were already turning heads on and\
  \ off the trail. Our crew, Take on Nepal, was empowering young Nepali women by employing\
  \ them as porters and guides, becoming the first trekking agency in the Himalayas\
  \ to break this gender barrier and providing a crucial opportunity in a society\
  \ where early childhood marriage and human trafficking are prevalent. The clients,\
  \ a group of nineteen women, hailed from around the world but were connected through\
  \ WHOA Travel, an all-women\u2019s travel adventure company that stands for Women\
  \ High on Adventure. Though this was my first time setting foot in the Himalayas,\
  \ it was as a Group Adventure Leader (GAL) for WHOA Travel. In the coming days,\
  \ I would rely heavily on the young women of Take On Nepal for their leadership\
  \ and experience, but none more so than eighteen-year-old Kamala. \n\nClad in a\
  \ brightly colored knit hat with ear flaps that perfectly framed her mischievous\
  \ smile, Kamala knelt excitedly beside Tiffany, who\u2019d just granted her permission\
  \ to inspect the large white plugs that stretched her ear lobes. Gingerly poking\
  \ a finger through the hole in Tiffany\u2019s ears, Kamala squealed in glee. Then,\
  \ giggling, she reached for a metal carabiner from her backpack and fastened it\
  \ through the gaping hole in Tiffany\u2019s ear. \n\nA week later, as the ladies\
  \ warmed themselves around a yak dung stove in the teahouse and prepared for the\
  \ nightly briefing from lead guide and Take on Nepal founder, Som, we learned of\
  \ the heartache behind Kamala\u2019s infectious smile. Like many of the crew members,\
  \ she was Som\u2019s cousin. At the tender age of five, Kamala and her sisters were\
  \ orphaned when their mother murdered their father and was sent to prison. In Nepal,\
  \ young children are often incarcerated with their parents. Though Kamala managed\
  \ to escape a prospective life behind bars with her mother, her infant sister, Pema,\
  \ was not so lucky. After years in prison, Pema was relinquished to the care of\
  \ a social worker named Pushpa Basnet. Founder of a nonprofit organization and boarding\
  \ home for children living behind bars, Basnet received international accolades\
  \ for her humanitarian efforts and was featured in the 2013 documentary Waiting\
  \ for Mamu. Though Som, Kamala, and her sisters were initially granted visitations\
  \ with Pema, Basnet objected to a permanent change in custody, and Som was embroiled\
  \ in a bitter custody battle for years before successfully reuniting the sisters\
  \ under his care. \n\nThroughout the fourteen-day trek, I would hear stories of\
  \ horrific childhoods. I\u2019d learn of those who lost everything in the earthquake.\
  \ Slowly, I\u2019d come to realize why the young women of Take on Nepal made climbing\
  \ this mountain look so effortless. Sagarmatha, the Goddess of the Sky herself,\
  \ would not be the one to leave the most lasting imprint on my heart. But I couldn\u2019\
  t have known this as Kamala strung a second carabiner and then a water bottle through\
  \ Tiffany\u2019s ear lobe and dissolved into a fit of convulsive laughter."
