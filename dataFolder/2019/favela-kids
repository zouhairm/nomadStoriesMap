Text: "It\u2019s 4am and the streets of Rio are starting to cool. The sweltering heat\
  \ that once grappled at my neck and slid down my back is loosening it\u2019s tension\
  \ on the curls that frame my face and dance around my shoulders, extending down\
  \ to just below my waist. The inky blue sky has devoured the streets, leaving us\
  \ with a subtle glow from the scattered streetlamps and the sounds of insects with\
  \ names too long to pronounce. I\u2019m exhausted after an evening of dancing salsa,\
  \ samba and forr\xF3, the latter being a traditional Brazilian dance that is essentially\
  \ an English two step, but an intensely upbeat Latino version. \n\nAmbling down\
  \ the streets reminds me of Europe, what with the greenery of the palm trees and\
  \ the uneven pavements, accompanied by the pride that glows from each flag; one\
  \ of which I had wrapped around my hips only a few hours before on return from the\
  \ beach after vainly attempting to reach the golden shimmer that only the most exotically\
  \ breathtaking of people seem to achieve\u2026 or in other words, Brazilians. \n\
  \nA friend grasps my arm, making me jump from the anxiety that is suddenly vibrating\
  \ from his body, his breath has caught in his throat and I notice a stern crease\
  \ in his brow that hadn\u2019t been there a mere 10 seconds before. He pulls me\
  \ behind him and whispers to me in Portuguese to hold my breath, to not utter even\
  \ a single world. I hear a distant lullaby of voices and despite my better judgement,\
  \ try to peek out from underneath his elbow. Children, no older than 12, come into\
  \ view as they turn a corner, no more than 150 yards away, parading down the street\
  \ with rifles and what appears to be a couple of makeshift wrench hammers.\n\nI\
  \ glimpse around at my comrades\u2019 faces and notice how their stances have stiffened,\
  \ knowing full well that despite their size and capabilities as dignified navy officers,\
  \ they didn\u2019t have faith in their strength compared to the speed and the fearlessness\
  \ of the favela kids. \n\nIn a split decision before we came into their view, we\
  \ slink into a dark spot behind a couple of denser trees, waiting for them to pass\
  \ with bated breath, not daring to tweak the ivy that dug into our backs as we backed\
  \ up against a wall that hadn\u2019t seen fresh paint in over 60 years. Adrenaline\
  \ spiked the air, alongside a distinct fear of alarming the children into loading\
  \ our body with foreign bullets. \n\nThe kids carried on in their stride, unwavering\
  \ and quite happy singing an old children\u2019s rhyme, one of which sounded unnervingly\
  \ similar to \u2018teddy bears picnic\u2019, an English classic that you could so\
  \ often hear drumming out of ice cream vans back home. A sobering reminder that\
  \ these children, were indeed, only children. Except they hadn\u2019t grown up with\
  \ doll houses and leisurely trips to the park, but with white lines on tables, red\
  \ stains on walls and broken glass on the floor. \n\nDespite the assurance of renewed\
  \ safety from the five Brazilians, we hurried home in silence, dosed in a sobering\
  \ wave of reality that until this point, had hidden under a cloak of caipirinhas,\
  \ the beauty of the white sand, clear waters and an infectiously compassionate Latino\
  \ spirit."
