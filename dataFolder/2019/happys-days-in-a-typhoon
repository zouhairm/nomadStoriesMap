Text: "Farewell dear stable land, I will see you in a week. Excitement fluttered through\
  \ me as we untied the ropes from the dock, waved goodbye to the folks who launched\
  \ us and motored out to sea. There is nothing like watching the land you were just\
  \ standing on slowly disappear from you and realizing that it is just you, your\
  \ boat and your crew surrounded by deep, deep water. This is usually when the nerves\
  \ and seasickness settle in. Luckily, my eager beginner jitters kept any fears at\
  \ bay and we finished day one mesmerized by the cotton candy sunset skies. Unfortunately,\
  \ the euphoria didn\u2019t last long as we woke up to radio warnings of a typhoon\
  \ not far from the direction we were headed.\n\nUp until 2014, I had never voyaged\
  \ out on a boat outside of wakeboarding on smooth gentle lakes or cruising down\
  \ a river in a kayak. So what was I doing in Cebu, Philippines stepping foot on\
  \ an 82-foot superyacht called Happy Days and embarking on a week-long crossing\
  \ at sea? Through cosmic connections and a willingness to leap into the unknown,\
  \ I accepted a position to be the chief stewardess on this superyacht. Therefore,\
  \ Happy Days was not only my transportation from the Philippines to Palau, but also\
  \ my home for a while.\n\nThe waves grew bigger and the wind gained strength as\
  \ we veered towards another island in search of a bay for anchorage. We found a\
  \ small area where many other boats were similarly trying to hunker down for the\
  \ night. Although the eye of the storm didn\u2019t beat down on us directly, no\
  \ one in the bay slept a wink through that howling evening. As with all thunderous\
  \ storms, the calm afterward brought much relief and we carried on our voyage to\
  \ the tiny Micronesian island of Palau. The storm had passed but the seas remained\
  \ big and with only three crew members on board it meant our shifts of sleeping,\
  \ standing by and monitoring at the helm came in four-hour stretches. At night,\
  \ all trust goes into the autopilot system to keep you on the course and flag if\
  \ any boats or objects come in your path. I sat behind the wheel trying to focus\
  \ on the vivid swath of stars in the dark night rather than on the fact that the\
  \ entire boat was keeling over from side to side, making every joint, bolt and board\
  \ produce a deafening creak. \n\nAfter another four days of not seeing a single\
  \ other boat or land, we finally spotted an outline of little islands emerging from\
  \ the sea. Oh, happy days, we made it to our destination! Or at least we had almost\
  \ made it. There are approximately 340 islands that make up the country of Palau,\
  \ which also means there\u2019s an abundance of reefs and shallow beaches to navigate\
  \ through before reaching the harbour. To make this navigation more challenging,\
  \ one of our engines decided to give up on the last part of the journey and our\
  \ radio fritzed out during the storm. So we went old school. We tied fishing wire\
  \ from Captain Nick at the helm down to me in the engine room, where I manually\
  \ controlled our one back-up engine. Nick would tug once for me to engage it forward\
  \ and twice to throw it in reverse. This is what got us into Palau. I\u2019ve never\
  \ been more happy to put my feet back on stable land, but I would do it all again\
  \ in a heartbeat."
