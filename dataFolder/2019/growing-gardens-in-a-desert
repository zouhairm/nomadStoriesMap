Text: "Three years ago, I had the chance to visit Jordan while I was performing with\
  \ a Theatre company .We had the wonderful chance to meet local people who does \
  \ great labors over there.\n One of this amazing locals is You, he is japanese ,\
  \ but now he consider his home Jordan. He has the  goal of turning a desert to a\
  \ fruit forest. I volunteered a day to get to know more about the challenges he\
  \ has to overcome. He is completely sure that this experiment of growing fruit trees\
  \ and vegetable with permaculture, can be the answer to hunger. He happily overcomes\
  \ heat and dry ground everyday with the same patience that magicians had whie trying\
  \ to  convert carbon to gold. We all finished thirsty and with the skin burned.\
  \ But this ninja showed us how a goal can make you stand anything for it. \n The\
  \ other great local is Munter, he works taking syrian children who lived in refugee\
  \ camps to a monthly canyon hiking. He explained us how difficult and what a big\
  \ responsability is to take people out of the camps. For this cnildren , this excursions\
  \ are so expected and give them relief,since the campas are isolated in the middle\
  \ of the desert. By the way, I had the chance to  make this excursion and it offered\
  \ great red landscapes with waterfalls which are beduines everyday sights.\n This\
  \ great locals made me question what should I do for my country and for my society\
  \ back to my mexica  land. Also gave me hope that there are a lot pf persons willing\
  \ to help our planet and other people. \n Both experiences ended with a Mansaf dish\
  \ (lamb with yogurt) and a coffe .The typical jordan meal."
