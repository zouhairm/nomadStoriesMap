Text: "He leans effortlessly against the wall ahead, the glare of his motorbike a\
  \ shock to my wide eyes. I can feel it rising again. Panic. I try to push it down\
  \ and keep running forward, my hand still gripping Chloe tightly. It\u2019s not\
  \ panic that I see in her eyes; it\u2019s fear. I need to fix this.\n\nHis eyes\
  \ flick downwards to my hand, the red slowly seeping through my fingers. He\u2019\
  s pointing at the motorbike with a sense of urgency. There\u2019s only room for\
  \ the two of us. I glance at the second motorbike and then at Chloe. No. We can\u2019\
  t split up. I look again at her arm; my hand still squeezing it tightly. We need\
  \ to go. We need to go now. I kick my leg over the metal and it seers against my\
  \ skin. That\u2019s going to leave a mark. I glance across at her once more, and\
  \ then she\u2019s gone, speeding off through a sea of donkeys.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\
  \nThe sights and sounds exploded around us in a riot of colour. Ochre-dusted lanes\
  \ straight from the pages of Harry Potter. The stalls were abuzz with tourists and\
  \ locals, spiritedly haggling over beautiful handmade wares. Animal carcasses swung\
  \ on hooks next to twinkling lamps and necklaces. Lane after lane, stall after stall,\
  \ each arterial led us towards the city\u2019s beating heart; the Djemaa El Fna.\
  \ As we stepped into the medina, Marrakesh\u2019s story began to dance before us.\n\
  \nA former site of public executions, the square is now more akin to a glorious\
  \ buffet with something to satisfy everyone\u2019s taste buds. Master storytellers\
  \ bringing urban legends and oral history to life; snake charmers and monkeys led\
  \ around on chains that shed light on the city\u2019s darker side. Dancers and singers,\
  \ acrobats, troupes and henna tattoo artists all seek applause and a few dirham.\n\
  \nThose first days in Marrakesh were a haze of getting lost and then being found\
  \ by often less-than-altruistic locals looking for an easy buck. Or dirham as it\
  \ were. However, with each passing day we became more and more confident in our\
  \ ability to navigate the labyrinthine streets.\n\nA day spent riding camels named\
  \ after pop divas, bartering for a bargain and devouring camel burgers at Caf\xE9\
  \ Clock whilst riddled with guilt left us feeling ready to match the old city\u2019\
  s frenetic pulse.\n\nWe ventured into the medina as the day faded into darkness.\
  \ The lights had gone out, but the party was only just beginning. We wandered the\
  \ stalls, the tang of tagine almost visible in the air. A man approached us, a twinkle\
  \ in his eye. \u201CHow much? 5 camels?\u201D \u201COh, no thank you. Chloe isn\u2019\
  t for sale. Also, no, her name is not Shakira.\u201D The madness, the mayhem, the\
  \ magic; Morocco was really putting on a show.\n\nThe day began like any other.\
  \ Once again, we were lost in the lanes that seemingly led to nowhere. A local man\
  \ directed us towards another man; a friend bound for the famous leather tanneries.\
  \ We wound deeper and deeper into the maze, further from the medina, further from\
  \ our chaotic haven. \n\n\u201CYou want to buy a rug?\u201D\n\u201CNo thank you,\
  \ we should really be going.\u201D\n\u201CTwo hundred.\u201D\n\u201CSorry, we don\u2019\
  t have that much.\u201D\n\u201CYou pay now.\u201D\n\nThe city\u2019s dark side was\
  \ again at the forefront.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, chaos. \n\nFootsteps; slow\
  \ at first, then faster, faster. And the old city closed its gates.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\
  \n\u201CWhat happened? Are you okay?\u201D I cling desperately to this stranger,\
  \ his shirt now stained a deep red. We speed through the lanes past donkeys and\
  \ horse-drawn carriages. We are going home.\n\nI trace the scar on my leg, now just\
  \ the faintest reminder of a day. But it\u2019s not the fear or the panic that comes\
  \ to mind. It is him that I remember. I don\u2019t recall the colour of his eyes\
  \ or the way his hair fell around his face. What I will always remember is his voice;\
  \ \u201C Let me help you.\u201D"
