Text: "On a sunny day in April 2011 , in Alexandria the city of love and fairy tales\
  \ and cultures , where the sky is bright and clear and the waves of the sea are\
  \ dancing in a calm way sort of forming a melody ,life is going on where the cars\
  \ are rushing through the streets ,men are on their way to their jobs to make money\
  \ ,old and young people are walking , jogging by the sea ,bicycles are here and\
  \ there ,cats are following the fishermen to have their meals ,happy faces are all\
  \ around . In this very month with these beautiful conditions around ,where you\
  \ can smell happiness and good vibes all around, Mourad has decided to declare his\
  \ love to Karima ,  two young lovers who have a shinning future ahead of them and\
  \ are willing to confront this life hand in hand as their love is way deep that\
  \ it can break the stones and travel into the space ..they form a unity when they\
  \ are together , nothing can break them apart and to document that love, Mourad\
  \  hanged a lock on the fence  of Stanly  bridge and stood by the fence , Karima\
  \ was delighted by such behavior as it in  her eyes symbolize the true meaning of\
  \ love , Mourad then  threw the key into the deep sea  .The key remained suspended\
  \ in the sky until it hit the sea water and slowed all the way down  ... And during\
  \ the path to the bottom,  it was picked up by a huge fish which  thought it was\
  \ delicious food .. the key remained in  the belly of the fish and  it completed\
  \ its journey in the sea and swam in the depths way too far from the bridge, the\
  \ fish swam easily and fast cutting miles  .... Meanwhile a giant brethren  was\
  \  in the sea making it's way to have it's good fortune from the sea sailing steadily\
  \ ,knowing its pass as it has been taking through the years .It threw it's enormous\
  \  net with all the strength it had , fishermen were abroad on deck looking and\
  \ watching by their fierce  determined  focused eyes , waiting for the right time\
  \  to unload the capture of their fruitful day which requires  a lot of patience\
  \ and power to deal with angry ,rapturous ,restless tied fish .The huge crane kept\
  \ lifting the plunder and it kept swinging in the air .  our huge fellow was trapped\
  \ into the nets from the wide sea with other poor unlucky fish, being lifted ,he\
  \ struggled trying to escape  .. kept bending and pushing it's body up and down\
  \ , right and left but with no use at all .They were all carried from the sea and\
  \ distributed into stamped closed giant boxes . This kept the fishermen busy on\
  \ deck for a while ,distributing the fish according size and type .  It was dark\
  \ place around the key and above the darkness ,more darkness ...It was settled for\
  \ a while when suddenly a sound was heard . A very loud voice ....it was the sound\
  \ of hitting the ground pretty hard ....and then all the fish were laying and thrown\
  \ on the ground in a place sort of a market , alot of noises were heard here and\
  \ there , people are everywhere ,bargaining and making deals ,people fighting ,other\
  \ are paying money ,all happening at the same time . Long time have passed , can't\
  \ exactly determine the duration of it , but then light strikes it's way  to the\
  \ belly of the fish ... An elderly human body  is now seen in the view clutching\
  \ a fork and knife in an Italian  restaurant  of fish rejoicing in what is on the\
  \ plate of tomorrow ... of food and precious treasure in his eyes.As it appeared\
  \ to be a man with a taste and likes collecting old stuff. He believes that old\
  \ stuff always have something to say ,give and teach us and always have that smell\
  \ of years ago. After finishing the meal the man put the key in his pocket and gave\
  \ the waiter tips . \nThe key is now placed on a large slab with a set of old keys,\
  \ each with an interesting story to tell. who knew that the key would travel that\
  \ far far away?"
