Text: "Least traveled are the places that are most likely to be traveled. The closer\
  \ you are , the more distant you find yourself from it.\n\nIt's been nearly 10 years\
  \ I've been to Visakhapatnam though I grew up, educated and worked a mere 3 hours\
  \ away from it.\n\nWe are going to a traffic safety rally as part of our Corporate\
  \ Social Responsibility(CSR). This rally will be all along the sandy beach named\
  \ Ramakrishna Beach. Whatever they name it, CSR is one of the few marketing stunts\
  \ pulled by every IT firm.\n\nOur bus whizzed past few mangrove trees at Bheemili.\
  \ This used to be greener with more trees, bigger ones. Apart from few new employees\
  \ most of us are disinterested as it's neither a new place(most of us live in this\
  \ very district) nor the rally an interesting thing to do on a weekend. \n\nThe\
  \ Jewel of East Coast or Vizag as it has been nicknamed, a natural harbor, a port\
  \ city defended by Indian Navy, this beautiful place along with its people is still\
  \ recovering from the effects of the cyclone Hudhud. It could possibly be no more\
  \ the pleasant place I've visited last time.\n\nWe rallied along the beach shouting\
  \ the slogans about Traffic Safety, but I couldn't stop admiring the clean beaches\
  \ which no more filled with debris. \n\nUnder what rock has been my head all these\
  \ years! I've felt like a stranger in my own land, I no longer recognized it. It's\
  \ not a wounded city anymore, it's filled with the vigorous energy of a youth.\n\
  \nNo wonder it has been declared the 3rd cleanest city in India.\n\nGVMC has set\
  \ up a museum for both aerial and aqua based warfare equipment as a source to attract\
  \ tourists. As the wiki has put it perfectly, ' The INS Kursura Submarine Museum\
  \ and Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraftTU 142 Aircraft Museum opposite to each\
  \ other is the only of its kind in the world, conceptualizing the hunted and hunter\
  \ of the wars. '\n\nAfter the rally is completed, we are left to our devices and\
  \ are expected to get back to the bus by another half an hour or to be left back\
  \ here. \n\nI've increased my pace looking for the Oceanarium. I still remember\
  \ looking at the aquatic life(dead and alive) with awe. Among the new tourist attractions\
  \ is the old guy who've has lost his charm. He's obviously been left with little\
  \ to no development. Like an old corpse rotting and decaying with time, he no longer\
  \ has the life which inspired my fascination for marine life. Why does good memories\
  \ always succumb to old age and left to rot away. It no longer felt the same place\
  \ I've visited with my father. I was completely dejected.\n\nI joined my colleagues\
  \ sitting on a Sea wall and ordered the Muri Mixture, also known as Andhra BhelPuri.\
  \ I could no longer look at the old guy breathing his last. I shifted my gaze towards\
  \ the sea. Across me are few students creating ruckus, a party atmosphere. There\
  \ is music and few of them are dancing with their friends or just acquaintances.\n\
  \nThey should be celebrating, it seems they've cleaned up the beach. A good work\
  \ always needs a celebration. Snacks and water bottles are distributed. \n\nSaw\
  \ a girl sharing her snacks with a stray dog who apparently has been dehydrated.\
  \ She sat beside the mutt, patting and letting it drink water she has poured in\
  \ a small cup.\n\nShe could've simply had her ration of Snacks and water after a\
  \ long stressful day, yet she took care of the dog. I tried taking a picture of\
  \ her, from this distance the picture is too grainy. I didn't expect to find someone\
  \ who is beautiful both in and out, yet couldn't click her.\n\nWe've boarded the\
  \ bus and moving away from us, \"pelli kooturu la mustabu aina Vizag\", decorated\
  \ like a new bride, Vizag illuminated her beauty with street lights accentuating\
  \ it further. \n\nI guess it's not the place that looks beautiful, it's the people\
  \ who make a place beautiful."
