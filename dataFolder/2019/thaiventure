Text: 'Being a Teacher in the Philippines would not make you earn enough to luxuriously
  travel to places you would like. It is a rare opportunity to visit places you would
  only see in videos. Luckily, i was able to visit Thailand to celebrate my birthday.
  Thailand has been one of the most visited countries on Asia because of it''s rich
  culture and great people.

  During the time when my friends and I visited, it was the time when they declared
  Martial Law in the capital ciry, Bangkok. So, we decided to visit the provinces
  beside Bangkok which are Kanchanaburi and Ayuthaya, which are also the most visited
  tourist places in Thailand.

  Ayuthaya is famous for their temples and structures that show the rich culture and
  religion of Thailand. One of the most unforgettable temples we visited was the tiger
  temple. Wherein, believe it or not, we were brought inside a tiger den to take pictures
  with the tigers. They say that tigers are tame becuase of the monks and because
  of the Gods. It was indeed a great experience for me and my friends.

  In Kanchanaburi, we were able to experience riding an elephant. Elephants has been
  a national symbol for Thailand that is why one of the must-try attractions is the
  elephant ride. It was very memorable to be able to experience riding an elephant
  and be able to tour around the park.

  Indeed, Thailand is one of the must-visit countries in Asia. I know there are still
  a lot to explore in Thailand and I must come back someday for more Thaiventures!'
