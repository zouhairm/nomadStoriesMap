Text: "It was October 2015 and I had been awarded a scholarship to do my master's\
  \ degree in the United Kingdom. Coming from Mexico, this was going to be a great\
  \ adventure! After a ten hour flight to London, a roughly two hour flight to Newcastle\
  \ and a forty minutes travel by coach, I had finally arrived to what is now my favorite\
  \ place on earth, Durham. \n\nDurham is a tiny little town in the Northeast part\
  \ of England, home of the world heritage site Durham Cathedral. Durham is this land\
  \ that you would never imagine it existed, a land surrounded by nature, a river,\
  \ a castle and cobbled floor throughout the two streets that form the city centre,\
  \ a land similar to a princess' tale, a land with history. \n\nDurham is known as\
  \ a land of miners, and every July several groups of miners march on the streets,\
  \ every group carries each own flag, and they march with their own brass band.,\
  \ each band performs several music acts before reaching a big fair next to the river,\
  \ in which many food stalls are found along with some local fair games, such as\
  \ darts or fishing the rubber duck in which you could win a prize. But Durham is\
  \ much more than that, Durham is also a place full of light, during its big and\
  \ renowned event Durham Lumiere.\n\nDurham Lumiere comes to the city every two years\
  \ , lightning the Cathedral , the Castle, and the surroundings of the city centre.\
  \  During Durham Lumiere the Cathedral lights up at night showing different colorful\
  \ and artistic patterns all around it., moreover, several visual effects are put\
  \ alongside the city centre such as a very realistic big smiley moon or colorful\
  \ lights all around the forest and the botanic garden, however Durham is not just\
  \ visual but also musical. \n\nDurham turns into a vibrant and lively place when\
  \ the International Brass Band Festival comes round every summer, performing a vast\
  \ and huge repertoire of well known songs in the hearth of the city centre under\
  \ the warm sun. Durham is full of life, life that you could spot since you wake\
  \ up every morning and go out of your house, seeing some rabbits running all around.,\
  \ or probably you are cooking in the kitchen, and look outside the window spotting\
  \ a dear in the back woods of your home.  That was my experience at Durham, a land\
  \ full of scenery, a land brought to life from a Disney film, where Buzzards lay\
  \ on to your windows on a normal sunny day. \n\nBut apart from hearing and seeing\
  \ the magic of Durham, you can also taste it. Durham holds a huge variety of cafes,\
  \ restaurants and pubs. Pubs in Durham are one of the most British places you could\
  \ ever eat in, selling traditional British food such as the Sunday roast with a\
  \ Yorkshire pudding , some Cumberland sausages with mushy peas, or if you fancy\
  \ something in an early afternoon, why not going for an afternoon tea and trying\
  \ all the variety of sandwiches and desserts that British cuisine could offer, such\
  \ as the delicious Marie Rose prawn sandwich and a very traditional scone with clotted\
  \ cream and raspberry jam. \n\nTravelling to Durham was for me a life changing experience,\
  \ without even counting the nice and friendly people that I met there, people that\
  \ I never expected to meet coming from such different and distant places to my home\
  \ country such as Mauritius, Antigua and Barbuda, and Japan. People from whom I\
  \ learnt a lot and made a friendship for life.  If I could ask life for a wish,\
  \ it would definitely be to go back to Durham, a place in which my deepest wishes\
  \ came true and in which I could really feel the magic coming to life."
