Text: "2 years ago, I visited my old friend in Cam My, Vietnam. Cam My is a rural\
  \ district of Dong Nai Province in the Southeast region of Vietnam. A small district\
  \ which is approximately one hour drive from Ho Chi Minh City. Beyond my imagination,\
  \ this district is still filled with rubber forests with inhabited by only a few\
  \ hundred of households. It\u2019s like traveling with a time machine, this district\
  \ reminds me of Jakarta in the 60s. Their people, their fashion even their font\
  \ that they use in billboard are very old school.\n\nMy friend lives in a small\
  \ house with a large yard, where his father does farms there. They still use wooden\
  \ beds, not yet using mattresses. Therefore, they put me in the only one hotel in\
  \ the village. Like the people in the village, they still interact with each other.\
  \ We are going to the local market looking for breakfast in the morning. At the\
  \ local market we interact with local residents, even the seller kindly explains\
  \ the type of food that they have. As long as here, I interact with local people\
  \ using body language. Because they still use their language which I don't understand\
  \ at all, yes at all. \n\nAt beginning, I only wanted to stay overnight in My Cam,\
  \ then I will spend my vacation in Ho Chi Minh City. Really! This city made me curious\
  \ and changed my original plan. I extended my vacation in My Cam, there were several\
  \ places recommended by my friends. One of them are Vung Tau, a coastal city that\
  \ is not too crowded and only visited by a few local tourists. Please make a note,\
  \ in Vietnam so many people use motorbikes, including my friend. He has 4 family\
  \ members and they have 4 motorbikes, according to the number of their family members.\
  \ To go to Vung Tau, we rented a car (the type of car that I have not seen in Jakarta\
  \ for a long time) In Vung Tau, I climbed to a hill where there was a giant Jesus\
  \ statue on it. From the top of the hill, I could see the whole city of Vung Tau.\
  \ After getting tired of climbing the hill, I stopped by a roadside coffee shop.\
  \ There I ordered one glass of Vietnamese ice coffee to get rid of thirst and enjoy\
  \ the blowing breeze.\n\nMany things are impressive from this city besides its inhabitants,\
  \ their food and the experiences. I wish I can explore more city in the other side\
  \ of the earth, to connect more people and to learn more."
