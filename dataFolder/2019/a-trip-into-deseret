Text: "Utah is probably one of the most misunderstood areas in the United States.\
  \ It hosts a lot of ski resorts and beautiful national parks. It is also the headquarters\
  \ of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. You probably know this group\
  \ better as the Mormons. I know what you\u2019re thinking. Between their emphasis\
  \ on conservative family values and de-emphasis on alcohol, Utah is like Disney\
  \ Land sans any fun. But that\u2019s not quite fair or true.\n\n\tDespite any stereotypes\
  \ that may accompany this state, I ended up making the journey there back in February\
  \ of 2015. Departing at the refreshing hour of 4 am, my friend Bissy and I departed\
  \ for the day long 12-hour trip from Portland, Oregon to Provo, Utah to visit our\
  \ mutual friend Ellie. Together, we were one agnostic and one \u201Cfrozen chosen\u201D\
  \ Protestant driving into the heart of the colloquially named \u201CMormon Bubble.\u201D\
  \ Whatever the opposite of \u201Ctwo pilgrims in an unholy land\u201D is, that would\
  \ be us. Eleven and a half hours in we crossed the border from Idaho into Utah.\
  \ This provided an opportunity to turn off the radio and play a game I like to call\
  \ Utah Bingo. Here are some of the items on that list:\n\n\u2022\tA cinema playing\
  \ R rated movies\n\u2022\tA bar \n\u2022\tA gay bar\n\u2022\tA caf\xE9 (because\
  \ Mormons can\u2019t drink coffee if you didn\u2019t know) \n\u2022\tA tea room\n\
  \u2022\tA church that isn\u2019t Mormon\n\n        All items on this list were checked\
  \ off within the first hour of crossing the state line. Which illustrates that despite\
  \ being the most religiously homogenous state in the union, not everyone in Utah\
  \ is Mormon. Nor is every Mormon quite so pious, as I\u2019ve always known, seeing\
  \ as the friend we were meeting is Mormon. \n\n        We arrived in the college\
  \ town of Provo at 6 pm. While Bissy could stay with Ellie, I as a man could not.\
  \ Therefore, I was designated to an all-boys house across the street. At first,\
  \ the sights there seemed standard. Just a bunch of college students playing video\
  \ games. But then they decided it would be fashionable to dance on the tables. Later\
  \ that night when some young women decided to visit (on Valentine\u2019s Day no\
  \ less), these gentlemen thought they could impress them with their chemistry. That\
  \ chemistry involved lighting the table on fire ala hand sanitizer. It was in this\
  \ moment that I realized that Mormon college students behaved like almost any other\
  \ group of college students, minus the usual inspiration to get there. If you couldn\u2019\
  t guess, that means booze.\n\n\tThe following day we made our way to Salt Lake City\
  \ to visit the Temple Square. Whatever your thoughts on the Mormon Church, it is\
  \ a landmark that is certainly worth the visit. Like the Vatican or the many sights\
  \ of Jerusalem, it provides a lot of historical and cultural insight into the faith\
  \ it represents. There you learn all about the history of the Mormon Faith, from\
  \ its founder Joseph Smith to its relevance today. One thing that was especially\
  \ noticeable in Temple Square was the church\u2019s emphasis on its now global community.\
  \ All the guides at the visitor center had flags under their name tags signifying\
  \ their country of origin. They really want you to know that the church is more\
  \ than a small enclave in the heart of Utah. \n\n\tUpon our return to Provo, we\
  \ started preparing for dinner. While the food was being cooked, we (myself, Bissy,\
  \ Ellie, and her roommates) started playing a rousing game of \u201CNever Have I\
  \ Ever.\u201D Once again, this notoriously revealing game broke more stereotypes.\
  \ All of the Mormons present were guilty of various vices, from skinny dipping to\
  \ drinking caffeinated soda.\n\nAt this dinner I also got to meet Ellie\u2019s roommates,\
  \ an interracial Mormon lesbian couple, a combination of words that will never be\
  \ boring to utter. And ultimately, it just goes to show that one should never stereotype.\
  \ Whether it\u2019s by religion, race, nationality, or any other demographic, it\u2019\
  s always easy to assume \u201Cthey are all alike.\u201D As always though, the truth\
  \ is more complex."
