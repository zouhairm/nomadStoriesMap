Text: "Budapest is split in two sections divided by the Danube River, Buda on one\
  \ side and Pest on the other, connected by several impressive bridges. We are staying\
  \ on the Pest side which conveniently has the most to offer. \n\nSights in Budapest\
  \ are spread out, making walking to everything difficult, so we rode the Hop on\
  \ Hop off bus allowing us to capture the best of what the city has to offer, such\
  \ as the thermal baths.  We were all a little hesitant bathing with hundreds of\
  \ strangers in baths of different temperatures, some for medicinal purposes (smelly\
  \ and green) and some purely for pleasure. The baths were amazing, three huge pools\
  \ outside - one for fun, one for relaxation and one actually for swimming.  The\
  \ fun one was medium temperature and had bubbles at times and an area that you were\
  \ whooshed through a whirlpool, the relaxation one was the hottest and was like\
  \ a giant hot tub without bubbles and you guessed it  the swimming pool was cooler\
  \ and you actually swam in it. Bathing caps a must and rental bathing suits available.\
  \  Inside there were several smaller pools of varying temperatures and saunas and\
  \ steam rooms for medicinal purposes.  You could just imagine what went on in these\
  \ places in times past.\n\nThe Budapest Parliament buildings are breathtaking. They\
  \ are filled with stained glassed windows, homemade rugs, beautiful golden gilt\
  \ statues, frescoes on the ceiling and chandeliers abound.  The 800 year old crown\
  \ is displayed nicely within the golden walls of this architectural gem. We learned\
  \ that the crown was entrusted to Jimmy Carter for 30 years for safe keeping at\
  \ Fort Knox before returning it to its rightfully owners.   \n\nAfter our exploration\
  \ of the city and a lovely lunch in a tradition English Pub which cost 12,500 Forints,\
  \ we boarded river boat and worked our way back down to our end of the river, which\
  \ is quickly becoming very comfortable and familiar to us. We now have the transportation\
  \ system mastered so we carried on the Great Market , which unfortunately is very\
  \ commercialized now. The ingredients we didn\u2019t get at the market we managed\
  \ to get at our local supermarket. Some items required playing charades with the\
  \ locals to find, everyone we encountered was kind and accommodating.  All in all,\
  \ a great few days in Eastern Europe."
