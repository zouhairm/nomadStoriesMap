Text: "Travel has always been something I've loved, even before I was able to do it.\
  \ I grew up in a big city in Texas, and my mom still recalls how I always said when\
  \ I was older, I'd move far away and never return. Guess it shouldn't be much of\
  \ a surprise that I did just that. Everybody has their reason for going somewhere.\
  \ For some it's business or family, some seek new thrills, some just want to relax\
  \ and unwind. Sometimes, it's even a combination. But normally after this pause,\
  \ however long, these people return to their lives and continue on. For me, I was\
  \ at a point where l found myself needing to leave. Not a vacation, not get my own\
  \ place, but go far away and start anew. Escape. Life had been adding more to my\
  \ plate than I was able to handle. As a recent college graduate my student loan\
  \ situation was dismal, I couldn't make the astronomical payments ($800 a month\
  \ just for private loans), I was living with my mother in an area I couldn't find\
  \ work in my major, I got guilted for not accepting any random job to to make ends\
  \ meet, and my small family had become even smaller with the passing of my grandmother\
  \ whom I was the closest with. That led to family inheritance fighting where I,\
  \ the youngest, got put in the middle to mediate and listen to bickering. I couldn't\
  \ do it anymore. So, I looked for alternative ways out of my situation. I have always\
  \ had lofty travel dreams coupled with practicality. I knew I wanted three things\
  \ from my next job. 1. To work in theatre. 2. To travel. 3. To pay off some of my\
  \ loans. I saw some friends who seemed to be doing well teaching English in South\
  \ Korea, so I talked to them. They knew with my background of summers working with\
  \ kids that teaching could be perfect for me. So I did it. I gathered the paperwork,\
  \ saved just enough money to get started and found a job. I was amazed by how easy\
  \ the whole process seemed. I said goodbye to my friends and family, spent my last\
  \ months with my mom, and then, January 2016, I made the move. I hopped on a plane\
  \ heading to South Korea. A place where I didn't know the language, the culture,\
  \ or anybody, as my friends had already departed. Who would've expected my planned\
  \ 2 years would result in a bit over 3. Was it perfection? No. But it was what I\
  \ needed to right my life and find my path once again. I started out first at a\
  \ job where the manager would scream and swear at teachers causing many new friends\
  \ to quit and leave the country, to discovering a gym with new hobbies that became\
  \ a second home. I found a new job at a far better and caring school for my final\
  \ 2 years. I discovered a love for Korean food, got to explore Korea, hike volcanoes,\
  \ go to cultural festivals, walk along the old city wall, go see the famed DMZ where\
  \ the North and the South stood watch against eachother. I got to experience the\
  \ impeachment of the President and see a country unite as one.Through this experience,\_\
  \ I was able to travel more and see other ways of life. I made new friends both\
  \ local and foreign who helped broaden my outlook, and I had a few heart aches.\
  \ I got to go see the Winter Olympics and\_ snowboard and ski alongside Olympians\
  \ at the ski runs. When I arrived the North was still doing missile tests, which\
  \ despite scaring the rest of the world, didn't faze anyone in the South. When I\
  \ left, the North and the South had met for the first time since the Korean war.\
  \ It was incredible being able to change alongside a country doing the same.\_ Sometimes\
  \ it takes a leap of faith to try to discover more about yourself and what you need.\
  \ I've found a passion for teaching and traveling, and I am excited to see what\
  \ my future holds and where I wind up."
