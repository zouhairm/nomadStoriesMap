Text: "With childhood memories of my parents belting out folk songs about Xinjiang\
  \ around our house in a small New England town, I grew up\u2013as a Chinese American\
  \ kid\u2013with a romantic vision of this faraway, mysterious land. Songs laced\
  \ with eloquently expressive lyrics that painted images of landscapes dotted with\
  \ immense deserts, rugged mountains, rolling pastures, sun-ripened watermelons and\
  \ soft lambs cuddled by girls with big, beautiful eyes. \n\nI was fascinated by\
  \ this geographically and culturally diverse region\u2013a vast autonomous zone\
  \ spanning the northwestern corner of China\u2013bordering Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan,\
  \ Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan and Tibet. Xinjiang is the\
  \ hub for various ethnic groups, with the Uighurs being the majority. The Uighurs\
  \ are Chinese Muslims with unique facial features that are a captivating blend of\
  \ Asian, Middle Eastern and European. It\u2019s a culture with their own Uighur\
  \ language, and a generous people known for their love of song and dance. \n\nI\
  \ excitedly set out on my solo adventure to Kashgar, a remote city in western Xinjiang\
  \ that Marco Polo traveled through; an oasis desert town that linked ancient China\
  \ to the outside world, with my vague plan to retrace the Silk Road. \n\nExpecting\
  \ an archaic village pregnant with buried secrets from the past, I felt a twinge\
  \ of disappointment when my bus ride from the airport revealed a typical modern\
  \ Chinese city with a six-lane road and nondescript communism-inspired concrete\
  \ buildings. Clich\xE9d street names such as Liberation Road, People's Road and\
  \ Cultural Road instantly killed off my romantic visions of stepping back in time.\
  \ \n \nBut as I took the time to roam out of the city center on foot, away from\
  \ the hordes of tourists and allowed myself to get lost through the winding narrow\
  \ side streets, I realized the modernity of Kashgar was only a facade. I found myself\
  \ amidst a maze of mud brick walls and dirt alleyways. I peeked through faded wooden\
  \ double doors with intricately patterned iron knockers into meticulously decorated\
  \ family courtyards, filled with curiosity about the lives behind these closed doors.\
  \ The further I meandered from the main roads, the less Mandarin was spoken. The\
  \ deeper I wandered into the backstreets, the more veiled the women's faces became.\
  \ With every twist and turn, time seemed to unwind, until my surroundings felt like\
  \ a place altogether forgotten by time. \n\nI sat down on a dust-covered fallen\
  \ tree by the side of a quiet, sleepy passageway that could be a scene lifted from\
  \ an Indiana Jones movie. Gnawing on a juicy pomegranate and making a dripping fuchsia\
  \ mess, my initial disappointment faded away. I wondered what life stories these\
  \ ancient walls have witnessed. Sinking into the rhythm of a place and absorbing\
  \ its energy is far more fulfilling than crossing off guidebook lists. With no schedule\
  \ to follow, no agenda to executive, I observed with intrigue the flow of life that\
  \ passed by.\n\nTwo old, wrinkly men donning kufi caps stopped next to me, animatedly\
  \ discussing and pointing to the log I was sitting on in their Uighur language,\
  \ completely ignoring my presence. Only when I smiled at them did they smile back\
  \ toothless grins with surprised looks on their faces, as if seeing me for the first\
  \ time. \n\nA little while later, a woman in her early 20\u2019s walked by. Upon\
  \ noticing me writing in my journal in English, she gently whisked the pen from\
  \ my hand without permission, and scribbled the letters GULNUR on the page. \"Your\
  \ name?\" Puzzled, I pointed to her and asked. Smiling, she nodded and walked away\
  \ without a word. \n\nAs the sun moved across the sky, two women emerged from their\
  \ courtyards simultaneously as if on cue and enthusiastically chatted away. I wondered\
  \ if they were exchanging neighborhood gossip? As I immersed myself in my writing\
  \ and sketching, the younger of the two women, with big, beautiful eyes, plopped\
  \ herself down next to me with curiosity, peaking over my shoulder with a shy grin.\n\
  \nSuch simple moments of connection, precious exchanges with strangers without words.\
  \ Encounters where minute details become magnified and seemingly insignificant gestures\
  \ become doorways into parallel worlds. Sitting on the wooden log under the golden\
  \ rays of the setting sun, my heart felt full."
