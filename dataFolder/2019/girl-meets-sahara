  \ of my group had asked their questions and left. Our tour guide stared at me. \u201C\
  Grace,\u201D he burst out, \u201CWhere do you think you\u2019ll charge your batteries?\
  \  Do camel drivers charge batteries?\u201D\n\nI shrugged.  My question was no worse\
  \ than the rest of my group\u2019s. \u201CWhere will we chill our wine?  When can\
  \ we buy more wine?  What happens if we run out of wi\u2014er, shampoo?\u201D  Despite\
  \ our guide having told us that the wine we\u2019d just bought needed to last three\
  \ days, since there are no wine shops in the Sahara.\n\nHow did I end up in the\
  \ Sahara with my wine-loving new friends? \n\nOnce upon a time, I was a child reading\
  \ and re-reading the 1001 Nights, also called the Arabian Nights.  I dreamed of\
  \ princesses, sultans, djinns, deserts, and camels \u2013 mostly of camels.  More\
  \ than anything, I longed to go to the Sahara, never mind that the Sahara isn\u2019\
  t part of the Arabian Peninsula.  To be fair, the Arabian Nights may have its origins\
  \ in Persia or India, two other places in which the Sahara \u2026 isn\u2019t.\n\n\
  I was no longer a child when I finally went.  So why the Sahara after all?\n\nThe\
  \ Arabian Nights is a story.  It\u2019s a second cousin to reality.  Isn\u2019t\
  \ the Sahara as good a desert as any?\n\nBut more than that, the Sahara was the\
  \ setting of my childhood dreams.  By the time I learned its geography, I was already\
  \ in love.  I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun \u2026 except I wasn\u2019\
  t in the middle, or anywhere near.\n\nFor years, I\u2019d looked and saved for an\
  \ English-speaking guide to take me into the Sahara.  Except even local women don\u2019\
  t hire guides to travel by themselves in that part of the world, and none of my\
  \ close friends were interested.\n\nOne ordinary day at work, I had my eureka moment:\
  \ I could join a tour.  A few days in the Sahara wasn\u2019t a week \u2013 but it\
  \ was far better than I\u2019d managed so far.\n\nIn less than a day, I\u2019d found\
  \ a highly rated small group tour of Morocco that included three days and nights\
  \ in the Sahara.  Due to a cancellation, there was even a discount \u2026 on a tour\
  \ starting in six days.  \n\nDid you know US passport holders don\u2019t need visas\
  \ for short stays in Morocco?  Taking a deep breath, I told my boss I needed to\
  \ take some vacation, and landed in Casablanca five days later.\n\n\n***\n\nI was\
  \ the youngest in my group.  Many were well-off enough that international travel\
  \ had become a comfortable habit.   They were amused by my delight with the trip,\
  \ my unconcealed anticipation of the Sahara.  One desert is much like another, they\
  \ told me kindly, and suggested I moderate my expectations.\n\nThey were generous;\
  \ they were genteel; they offered me wine. What mattered most: their genial indifference\
  \ to the Sahara, leading me to hope I\u2019d have my pick of camels.\n\nThis turned\
  \ out to be the case.  When the time came, half the group chose to rest in their\
  \ tents. \n\nAnd I?  I spent one of the happiest afternoons of my life on a camel\
  \ under the peerless Sahara sky, as I\u2019d dreamed of doing almost my entire life.\
  \  I passed the next 72 hours in a dream of joy, taking desert treks, admiring each\
  \ sunset and sunrise, eating jam and doughnuts, drinking wine.\n\n***\n\nThree years\
  \ later, I still dream of the Sahara, and now I have photos and memories to help\
  \ me.  My mind conjures caravans, oases, and a sleepless woman trapped in a golden\
  \ palace, spinning stories for her sultan to win her life.  \n\nI know Scheherazade\
  \ isn\u2019t real, that the stories of the Arabian Nights weren\u2019t told by a\
  \ single woman.  But after so long, she\u2019s real to me.\n\nShe would have exulted\
  \ in that beautiful desert.  She would have been moved to tears by the incomparable\
  \ luxury of a few days off, of speaking only when she wanted to speak, of walking\
  \ where she wanted, of sleeping through the nights.\n\nShe would have loved to travel."
