Text: "The story starts in July 2017, I was a temp salary in agrochemical industry\
  \ and I had just learnt that my contract will be extend for 6 months. After a full\
  \ campaign exporting chemical products, I needed a break and I falled on an article\
  \ discribing the best destinations to leave in September. I don\u2019t know why\
  \ but Puglia drawn immediately my intention. Some days later, I found a stay at\
  \ Torre San Giovanni in the South of Puglia. I immediately falled in love of Italy\
  \ and Puglia. The food was just amazing, the architecture beautiful and people very\
  \ warm. That was the first time I booked holidays alone, I was single and nobody\
  \ of my friends was available but that was the best holidays of my life. The first\
  \ day, I visited Lecce also called the \u201CFirenze of the South\u201D, I was amazed\
  \ by the baroc architecture, I liked to loose my way on the old streets. The next\
  \ day, I went to Gallipoli, I explored the fishing port and the old town, then I\
  \ went to Galatina but the cath\xE9drale was closed, what\u2019s a pity ! So I decided\
  \ to explore Porto Cesareo. After a good meal of risotto, I explored the beautiful\
  \ beaches, I preferred punta prosciutta which is very wild. I learnd that a tortule\
  \ layed her eggs on the beach  few years ago so the area was protected. The evening\
  \ at the hotel, I met the animator of the hotel, he proposes to come to a party\
  \ after the dinner, I came and then we went to drink a beer in the center of Torre\
  \ San Giovanni, we talked, he explained me that during his studies there was earthquake\
  \ and a lot of his friends died. At the beginning, I did not believed him I though\
  \ that was a strategy to soften me but then I saw his red eyes ready to cry. Everything\
  \ was closed in the town so we decided to come back to the hotel to drink something,\
  \ we stol a bottle of Prosecco in the bar and then we went to my bedroom. Everyday,\
  \ I went to visit the Salento and the night I found him to sleep. I am sure that\
  \ was a fling for him, we never met again since these holidays but I cannot explain\
  \ how hard was the return in France, i could not control my tears that were sinking\
  \ during my transit in Rome. Unless the romance I lived with this beautiful Italian\
  \ guy, I will never forget the beauty of the south of Puglia. The region is so rich\
  \ of culture and really authentic, I am sure I will come back one day. The most\
  \ beautiful beaches that I ever seen were in Puglia, I already went to Caribbean\
  \ but I found Baia de Turchi, the most amazing beach. To achieve the beach you have\
  \ to cross a road in the pins understory. I remember also the beauty of the Italian\
  \ countryside, I drove on the roads surrounded by olives threes. I visited Castro\
  \ and was very surprised to see people swim in the marina but the water was so clear\
  \ !  I cannot forget also the beauty of Pescaluse also known as \u201Cthe Maldives\
  \ of Salento\u201D. The trip was very enriching for me, I made other travel since\
  \ but nothing was so beautifully as Salento."
