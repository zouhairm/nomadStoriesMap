Text: "I picked up the receiver and listened to the man\u2019s voice: a monotonous\
  \ stream of words in a language I did not understand. \"Josef K.\", he repeated\
  \ at times, the only part that made sense to my ears. Josef K., the protagonist\
  \ of an absurd tale in an imaginary city. His creator, Franz Kafka, had been dead\
  \ for almost a century \u2013 but I was there, in the museum dedicated to his life,\
  \ in the Prague district of Mal\xE1 Strana, surrounded by rotary phones and filing\
  \ cabinets and his immortal words.\n\tFranz Kafka was dead, but I was alive, retracing\
  \ his footsteps along the Charles Bridge, looking up towards the same stone statues\
  \ that had once loomed over his figure. I wanted to understand how this beautiful\
  \ place became a labyrinth of existential dread in his eyes; I searched for someone\
  \ who could help me look beyond the fa\xE7ade and reveal the story of the city,\
  \ the beating heart within.\n\tDavid the tour guide was a Scotsman, the first one\
  \ I had ever met. He spoke with the strange and sweet accent of the country that,\
  \ unbeknownst to me at the time, would become my home a couple of years later. He\
  \ talked about the city that surrounded us, the buildings, the cobblestones, the\
  \ graves in the Jewish cemetery. As the boat we were on passed under endless archways,\
  \ he sunk a plastic cup into the river, and showed us how the murky green waters\
  \ of the Vltava became crystal clear in his hands.\n\tAfter the boat ride, I asked\
  \ him to walk with me as the sun was setting over Star\xE9 mesto, the Old Town district\
  \ where our mutual favourite author had been born and had spent most of his days.\
  \ We talked about the imaginary Prague, the paper-thin city that lay on top of the\
  \ real one like a stained glass pane. The ancient Castle, built in the 9th century,\
  \ had been the seat of power for kings and emperors throughout the years, but it\
  \ was also the enigmatic fortress that K. could never reach. Not only holy men and\
  \ wandering tourists had ever walked through the doors of St. Vitus Cathedral, but\
  \ also Josef K., finding solace in the midst of his trial.\n\t\u201CKafka worked\
  \ for most his life as an insurance officer, but he always thought of himself as\
  \ a writer above all else\u201D David said. \u201CThe job was just a way to pay\
  \ the bills, to survive so that he could keep on writing. His days were spent amongst\
  \ the mundane, and then he walked down these same streets, sat down at his writing\
  \ desk and surrounded himself with the fantastic. He died very young and nobody\
  \ knew his name. If his friend had respected his death wish and burned all his novels,\
  \ we wouldn\u2019t have, either.\u201D\n\tDavid asked me if I had ever been to Scotland;\
  \ I hadn\u2019t. I had no way of knowing that, only two years later, I would make\
  \ that land of lochs and glens my home. I would also become a tour guide, showing\
  \ visitors the splendour of a city that had not birthed me, but which I felt my\
  \ own, just like David and his Prague. I would look up towards Edinburgh Castle\
  \ and project upon it the vision of a man pleading to be let in: a Kafkaesque ghost\
  \ transported through time and space inside the pages of a book. I would sit to\
  \ rest in Parliament Square, by St Giles Cathedral, and surround myself with the\
  \ elusive memory of an afternoon spent in a different square, by a different cathedral,\
  \ listening to the sweet and strange words of a man who showed me the magical city\
  \ behind a brilliant mind."
