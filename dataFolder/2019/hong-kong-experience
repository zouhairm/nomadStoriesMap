Text: "It was September 12 2018, and my 2nd visit to Hongkong. This time I went with\
  \ my friend for holiday and shopping trip. And of course with the incentive of discount\
  \ airfare ticket from SQ. We've bought the ticket 4 months in advance and the date\
  \ seems perfect for both of our schedule as well.\n\nEverything went well. We've\
  \ visited Macau, see the casinos, enjoy Portuguese foods, do some awesome shopping,\
  \ and crossed all of our tourist bucket lists. \n\nThen on the 15th of September\
  \ 2018, just the day we've been expecting and we're about to pack and leave for\
  \ Jakarta the very next day, we are informed only by sms that our flight is cancelled\
  \ due to a category 5 Typhoon, namely Super Typhoon Mangkhut. Additionally, Mangkhut\
  \ was also the strongest typhoon to affect Hong Kong since\_Ellen\_in 1983.\n\n\
  Imagine that. What are the odds. Me, on my 2nd visit to HK, happen to experience\
  \ the strongest typhoon in HK in 25 years!\n\nIf it wasn't so bad I would actually\
  \ call myself lucky! \n\nWe frantically try to call SQ with no results. We went\
  \ to the HK Airport to at least talk to someone from SQ but there's nothing they\
  \ can do for us. For this, the only way is to call the Singapore number. To make\
  \ it worse, the Singapore call center put us on hold the whole time. It was a horrible\
  \ customer service experience.\n\nAnyway with mixed feelings and bit of anxiety\
  \ and panick, we prepare ourselves stocked up for the upcoming typhoon. Walking\
  \ around the town, it gets eerily scary as people putting \"X\"s on their glass\
  \ windows using black sticky tape everywhere. It sort of reminds me of Jakarta during\
  \ the 1998 riot where people writes \"PRIBUMI\" in front of the houses and stores\
  \ to protect them from people's wrath. But fortunately local people we saw around\
  \ the street doesn't seem to be panicked, so this has calmed us a little as well.\n\
  \nOn the day of the 16th, we are trapped whole day inside the 35th level of our\
  \ airbnb room, and fully experience the \"live show\" of typhoon madness, again\
  \ - I must repeat- strongest in 25 years, right before our eyes. I would say that\
  \ we're in the best spot to see it as well, with the panoramic window of our miniscule\
  \ twin room. \n\nThe \"show\" starts at 9am, and the typhoon is raging and creating\
  \ a visible savage gusts of winds in the empty space in the middle of the tight\
  \ apartment towers, whirling and whirling and tries to take away all the loose debris\
  \ along and throw it around. It also whistles eerily at times. Down below I saw\
  \ people still struggling to walk with the strong wind, and in the roof top of apartment\
  \ building lower than ours, we saw 2 people struggling to cover the roof top of\
  \ their house with plastic sheets to no avail.\n\nIt's scary and yet thrilling.\
  \ It's my first typhoon and I really don't know what to expect! \n\nBut then the\
  \ mad wind slows down by 2pm and it starting to drizzle normally. By 7pm we are\
  \ dead bored and since it seems that there's only light rain, we decided to come\
  \ out and look around, and maybe find for something to eat as well.\n\nThe once\
  \ tidy HongKong are ruined. Fallen trees, broken neon boxes, bent down traffic signages\
  \ and even broken motorcycles are everywhere. The typhoon showed no mercy. But amazingly,\
  \ the trusted 7-11s are still open on some parts and we can still buy our food and\
  \ snacks.  Not a proper one but we survived.\n\nThen SQ (finally!) called and told\
  \ us our new flight schedule back to Jakarta. We eventually extending our holiday\
  \ for a few more days while waiting for the flight out of HK because well, 900 flight\
  \ are either gets cancelled or delayed. And that amounts to at least some 15.000\
  \ people.\n\nWe finally went home, grateful to have witness and survives the Mangkhut,\
  \ and it truly is a leap to the unknown, which ends pretty well I must say."
