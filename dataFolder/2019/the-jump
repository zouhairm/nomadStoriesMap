Text: "As being in the Police Service, we hardly get time for ourselves, but once\
  \ in a blue moon we do get a chance to go for training in New Delhi, India. Such\
  \ was my chance which I avail in the month of March, 2018 and guess what we got\
  \ one weekend free for ourselves. As we all know Delhi is the transit point from\
  \ where one can go to all the Hill stations in the Northern India my plan was also\
  \ to go for River Rafting in Rishikesh, India. But I ended up going for Triund and\
  \ Kareri Trek in Himachal Pradesh .But later in the same year I got another chance\
  \ to go for training in New Delhi but this time after the training I reluctantly\
  \ ended up in Rishikesh.  As the monsoon season was in its peak, you never know\
  \ at what point of time you can be stuck in a road block for landslide or any other\
  \ natural calamities which Rishikesh was always prone to. As it was dangerous for\
  \ anyone travelling there but for me, I would be in trouble as I was literally \u201C\
  on duty\u201D. My plan was for River rafting for which this place was famous for\
  \ but due to heavy rainfall it was closed and instead I went for another call. \n\
  Bungy Jumping \u2026 \nThe Bungy Platform was an one hour journey from its head\
  \ office in Tapovan, Uttarakhand and it was India\u2019s highest platform scaling\
  \ 83 metres .\nAfter reaching the place-----------\nWe were briefed! \nForms were\
  \ filled!\nWeight checked!. \nBelongings locked! \nWe were ready to move!\n\nI was\
  \ sitting in the caf\xE9 waiting for my turn when I heard a staff member calling\
  \ my name. I was joined by another girl. I strike a conversation with her and got\
  \ to know that she was a journalist from Delhi and she had already done her Giant\
  \ Swing & Flying fox from this same platform. I was like \u201Cwow\u201D, & she\
  \ was a motivation for me.\nEven though I had done lots of adventurous stuff in\
  \ my life and was given the title of \u201CWonder Woman\u201D in the eve of Intl\u2019\
  \ Woman\u2019s Day 2018 but still I wanted someone to motivate me this time and\
  \ she was the one. \nWe both were ready by wearing all the safety gears and I first\
  \ asked her to go as in this case  she was far more experienced than me. She stood\
  \ there, waited and waited .Once you wait; the chances are less that you will be\
  \ able to perform.\n Later she told that this was her third time! Previously also\
  \ she came in this same platform twice but couldn\u2019t make it .She was in a kind\
  \ of a competition with herself .But she failed again. Once she crosses this barrier,\
  \ I think she will go back stronger.\nNext was my turn .I had to do it at once .I\
  \ didn\u2019t let her failure influence me  . I just had one thing in my mind that\
  \ I have to just go and dive , no waiting , no looking  down because once you look\
  \ down all gone  and it will be a failure  . There was a yellow board far away with\
  \ a point mark , I was asked to look at that point and not to look down , I kept\
  \ looking there! I knew I will shout Jai Bajarang Bali ki Jai (a motivating slogan)\
  \ and dive and I did exactly that , I shouted the slogan but couldn\u2019t complete\
  \ it as Man! I was already in the Air and after the half way I realized that I did\
  \ it and I shouted ---\n \u201CI did it\u201D. \nOh ! that was a feeling .\nYou\
  \ just need the guts to jump. It\u2019s just a matter of few seconds and I did it.\
  \ Just that jump all my presumptions went wrong! And I did it !\n\n I have achieved\
  \ a lot in my life but as once one RJ in an interview asked me:\nRJ - \u201C what\
  \ are you proud of?\" \nMe \u2013(Thinking )  \"I don\u2019t do something  to be\
  \ proud about; I just do it because I love to do it.\"\n \nBut this time I was really\
  \ Proud of myself !"
