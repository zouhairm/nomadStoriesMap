Text: "He spoke fervently of the turmoil his beloved country has been through, voice\
  \ heavy and eyes misty. The struggles and strife every citizen had to bear came\
  \ out of him in an overwhelming flow as we stood in front of the infamous, now graffitied\
  \ wall.\n\nWe walked on by, pushed by the morning crowd along the uneven cobble\
  \ stones exploring our next stop: Checkpoint Charlie. \n\nTourists stood in turn\
  \ to take a picture with a modern day \u201CGerman soldier\u201D, an odd excitement\
  \ buzzing in the air. Most of my mates eager to purchase souvenirs and the rest\
  \ focused on capturing every little stone in the city through their Apple lenses.\
  \ \n\nWhat was it, I wondered that made me ache about this city? I couldn\u2019\
  t quite put my finger on it as we wandered the streets. I stood in front of the\
  \ shed like structure, unable to comprehend that this once was a point where people\
  \ died for attempting to cross. \n\nShudders ran down my spine as I tried to imagine\
  \ away the dead fugitive lying in front of me. \n\nA deep sigh of the same ache\
  \ . \n\nI followed my guide as he made his way through the mob, with quick short\
  \ steps, onto the bus and on the way to our next destination:The Jewish Museum,\
  \ a tribute to the lost souls of the holocaust.\n\nThe building, an iconic gray\
  \ steel maze which encompasses the illustrious German-Jewish history, was nothing\
  \ compared, to the stories that it held inside. We were pulled into a world that\
  \ everyone and no one should ever see. \n\nMy jaw never really found its way up\
  \ as I walked through each exhibit. Walking, living, breathing and feeling an era\
  \ in matter of an hour really does send one's mind and emotions into a complete\
  \ toss. And all of a sudden the it made sense.  \n\nEveryone experiences pain, loss\
  \ and trauma in one way or another\u2026.and the ache? The ache, I realized, was\
  \ my heart, empathizing with another with the same emotions, even though the other\
  \ was behind a vintage frame enclosed in solid glass. The eyes said it all.  \n\n\
  I walked out of the museum, into the clear blue of the Berlin sky. Her rays of sunlight\
  \ and cold breezes that rustled through the Linden trees filled my sorrowed heart,\
  \ the one encumbered with the painful history of this city, with hope, a hope of\
  \ a better tomorrow. And at that moment I felt connected."
