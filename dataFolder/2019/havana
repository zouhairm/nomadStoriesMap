Text: "While sitting in a hot, sticky taxi after failing to get any money out of the\
  \ airport atm and praying that the twenty dollars we did have would suffice, I didn\u2019\
  t expect that we would fall in love with Havana. Although we were already frazzled\
  \ we couldn\u2019t help but soak in the sight of the colourful yet crumbling buildings\
  \ that surrounded us. This was the first indication of what to expect from Havana.\
  \ It is a bit of a fixer upper. The skeleton of what was once an affluent city remains\
  \ but the flesh has well and truly rotted away. You feel nervous to reach out and\
  \ touch anything as it may fall apart at the slightest movement. Our accommodation\
  \ was proof of this as we dodged leaking toilets, loose bed springs and questionable\
  \ food for our three night stay. We had mentally prepared ourselves for this having\
  \ listened to many a backpackers tale. We had gotten off lightly by all accounts.\
  \ We woke in the morning to incessant drumming that we soon discovered is the heartbeat\
  \ of Havana. It pulsates through your body filling you with anticipation and eagerness\
  \ for what lies ahead.\n\nThere is a sense of determination from the people of Havana.They\
  \ knows its strengths and weaknesses and they ensure that you know what makes it\
  \ unique. Music. Music fills the city whether it is a lone musician out on his balcony\
  \ in the morning practicing for his gig later that night or it is the thronged bars\
  \ like the El Floridita belting out loud jazz. Either way you find yourself moving\
  \ to the beat of the city. At the sway of a hip, gallery owners will rise from their\
  \ chess game to salsa dance with you among the installations. Havana is eager to\
  \ rise out of the rubble and spring back to life by showing its visitors all it\
  \ has to offer. \n\nCuba\u2019s history has influenced all of this. Their sense\
  \ of pride towards Castro and their idolisation of Guevara is so passionate that\
  \ you can\u2019t help but be intrigued by it. Guevara\u2019s iconic face is omnipresent\
  \ on t-shirts, lighters and other items of memorabilia found on every corner. It\
  \ is the classic underdog story. One of overthrowing the suppressors to set out\
  \ on their own. While wandering through the Museum of the Revolution you can\u2019\
  t help but share that sense of patriotism with them. You wish to see them succeed\
  \ in building a system that is on their terms.\n\nAlthough this has its disadvantages\
  \ in terms of service and quality. It is a city of hope and aspiration as you can\
  \ see changes happening. Around the Capitol the once neglected hotels are undergoing\
  \ a face-lift with chic cafes and bohemian bistros filling the streets that surround\
  \ them. Havana also appeals to the artist as haunts like the La Bodeguita del Medio\
  \ boasts of being a regular of Hemingway. Throughout the streets and along the Malecon\
  \ you will find dusty artist studios where a lazy cat will get up and stretch to\
  \ greet you as you peruse the vibrant paintings of Afro-cuban influence. It is impossible\
  \ to sit down for something to eat without being entertained by a live band. In\
  \ fact it is nearly impossible to just sit down as locals will pull you back up\
  \ again to join them for a dance. The discs bought from these bands won\u2019t reproduce\
  \ the joy felt in that moment. Only Havana can give you that feeling as you sip\
  \ on your mojito and soak in the culture that emanates around you.\n\nI left Havana\
  \ with a spring in my step, a sway in my hips and a slight roll in my shoulders.\
  \ Havana lingers in your memories for long after. It may not have the suaveness\
  \ of other cities but it will pull you in. It will embrace you with open arms and\
  \ convince you of its worth. Havana has drummed and danced its way into my heart\
  \ for forevermore."
