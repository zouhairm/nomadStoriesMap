Text: "Japan is a place of wonderful and sometimes frightening technological advancements.\
  \ And sometimes, if you are from rather removed parts of Australia, these advancements\
  \ can surprise you. Today a toilet entered my deepest regions in a most unexpected\
  \ way. As any normal person in a foreign country I like to explore, which often\
  \ means pushing every button I see. Sometimes there is no English guide. \nThe warm\
  \ penetrating stream of H2O stayed its course directly into my rear end for several\
  \ minutes before it occurred to me that it was not ceasing its ministrations. I\
  \ repeat, it would not cease. I tried another button which only caused the water\
  \ to become hotter and more ferocious in its attack on the small hole that decorates\
  \ my rear cheeks. The bathroom was empty of people and the lights gradually flickered\
  \ off with the lack of traffic moving through. \nI sat frozen in the darkness, unable\
  \ to stop the penetrating jet of water or leave the toilet during this aggressive\
  \ tongue bath for fear of the stream hitting the door or the tiles in front. I pressed\
  \ many buttons and experienced many things before the toilet permitted me to leave.\
  \ It's these small moments that can really make a trip; like finding a quality cup\
  \ of tea in a vending machine, or accidently eating offal broth as a vegetarian.\
  \ \nJapan: come for the culture, stay because you couldn\u2019t have left the bathroom\
  \ anyway."
