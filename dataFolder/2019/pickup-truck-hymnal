Text: "With pine needles stinging through our jeans in the swelling noon heat of July,\
  \ I picked burrs from Jordan's shoes by the side of Interstate 90. We sat underneath\
  \ the young ponderosa for relief from the incessant heat. We hadn't considered that\
  \ the ground below might not be so inviting. This was an odd place to find ourselves\
  \ on a Monday, underneath a tree by the highway; but we had to get Jordan to a job\
  \ interview in Eugene, Oregon, which meant hitchhiking to Seattle to pick up my\
  \ car, which I had left there a month earlier. \n\nOur first rides that morning\
  \ set a surreal tone for the day - our first was Mikey, who waxed something poetic\
  \ about stopping to smell the roses, gifted us an old Zippo lighter, and showed\
  \ us his sword when he dropped us off near the Montana-Idaho border, which he accidentally\
  \ nicked his cheek with while presenting it to us. (Note: the handle was shaped\
  \ like a dragon's head with a plastic ruby eye.) From there, Becky picked us up;\
  \ an aging hippie on her way to see the newest iteration of the Grateful Dead. Becky's\
  \ buoyant demeanor and laugh were contagious. She took to a hidden lake to dip our\
  \ feet, where we saw a moose. Somehow, it turned out Becky knew my mom \"back in\
  \ the day.\" \n\nNow we sat where Becky had left us, near a truck stop in western\
  \ Washington's prairie, vast and ochre-yellow, dotted with subdued green sagebrush\
  \ and small pines. We took a lunch break, sipped lukewarm coffee, half-joking about\
  \ getting one long ride, all the way to Seattle. There might be some science to\
  \ hitchhiking; intricacies of what makes a good or bad spot, timing, methods. If\
  \ so, we were clueless but incredibly lucky. We finished our lunch and stood by\
  \ the deafening, busy freeway. Within five minutes, a small white pickup truck pulled\
  \ over, haphazardly and hastily, stirring up a churning cloud of dust. We were greeted\
  \ by a friendly, albeit very sweaty man. By way of some comically cosmic synchronicity,\
  \ he rolled down the passenger window and, with a forced, enthusiastic smile, uttered\
  \ three magic words - \"Going to Seattle?\" \n\nMy good friend and former employer\
  \ David insists upon this idea of a 'friend for life'. The gist is that through\
  \ every meaningful interaction, or a simply kind introduction, you've formed a lifelong\
  \ friendship, even if you never see the person again. Mateo is definitely a 'friend\
  \ for life'. Humble and shy, he says very little and spends a long time pondering\
  \ his responses. Jordan and I squished into the bench seat of his tiny pickup truck\
  \ and tried to get cozy for the long haul across Washington state. There was no\
  \ air conditioning and the sun beat down, washing over the fields and sandstone,\
  \ painting us honey gold in the refracted illumination. \n\nAfter a few sun-dazed\
  \ hours of comfortable silence, Mateo cleared his throat and pointed to the windmills\
  \ lining the horizon. \"They blink their lights to communicate with each other.\"\
  \ Jordan and I looked to him, a bit confused. He elaborated, \"The red lights blinking\
  \ on the windmills; they're saying hello to each other so they don't get lonely.\
  \ They just blink and blink all night.\" We were stunned for a moment, then the\
  \ three of us erupted into hearty laughter. For the remainder of the drive, Mateo\
  \ was lively and talkative. He told us about his dream to walk from Alaska to Mexico,\
  \ his life and family, and taught us a hymn that we all sang over the fading pop\
  \ radio station - our pickup truck hymnal. \n\nEventually, Mateo dropped us off\
  \ in Seattle, where we got a night's rest before continuing our journey. We drove\
  \ to Eugene the next morning. Jordan didn't get the job, a writing teaching position\
  \ at a community college. But the hikes, time with old and new friends, and (more)\
  \ hidden lakes that followed were some of the most meaningful experiences we've\
  \ shared. I still often think of Mateo and wonder where he is. I wonder if he remembers\
  \ me, too. I imagine that when we do, we're like windmills saying hello, blinking\
  \ our red lights in the night."
