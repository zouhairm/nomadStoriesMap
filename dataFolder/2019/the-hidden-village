Text: "The sky was dark, and our bodies were still suffering after seven-hour driving\
  \ from Labuan Bajo when our local guide greeted me and my friends in Denge, the\
  \ starting point of three-hour trek to Waerebo, the hidden Manggaraian village.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWe must reach the top of the hill before sunrise, so you won\u2019t\
  \ miss the view!\u201D excitedly fumed the guide. Confused and sleepy, we came behind\
  \ him down to the rocky pathway, gripping the flashlight as if our lives depended\
  \ on it.\n\n\u201CAll of you would wake up before this pathway ends,\u201D mused\
  \ him while explaining the trekking route.\n\nIt\u2019s true. The rocks were a great\
  \ wake-up call. The sharp corners made us feel like we were shoeless. We felt like\
  \ toddlers stepped on pointy toys. We almost cursed, but the sound of the river\
  \ released us from the misery. Wae Lomba, the river\u2019s name. It also happens\
  \ to be the first checking point.\n\n\u201CAfter this river, we head to the rain\
  \ forest pathway. Be careful since it\u2019s slippery, thanks (but no thanks) to\
  \ the prior rain!\u201D he reminded me who almost dashed frantically. \u201CAnd\
  \ don\u2019t you do dare venture into the village before I arrive. Remember, an\
  \ entrance ritual must be performed for the guest,\u201D shouted him.\n\nUpon answering\
  \ him, I picked up the pace, leaving behind my friends. Maybe because of the cold\
  \ wind, or the darkness, or the time limit, I only focused on the narrow path in\
  \ front of me, completely dismissing the beauty of this forest. Slowly, I could\
  \ see tiny specs of light escaping through the trees. I walked faster than before,\
  \ recalling our guide\u2019s description of the pristine paysage view that I would\
  \ come upon soon.\n\nI reached the top of the hill just in time, the second checking\
  \ point, Poco Roko. The sun just rose, and its ray pushed out the morning mist.\
  \ Flores stunning landscape began to appear, the mountainous and green landscape\
  \ glistened from the sunrays. A look of awe crept into my face, and I couldn\u2019\
  t stop absorbing the view into my memory.   \n\nAs I hiked further and got more\
  \ tired, I felt the route is harder to the third checking point. However, the fatigue\
  \ was gone once I cleared the third checking point, Nampe Bakok. With morning mist\
  \ was gone, I could see the Waerebo iconic houses in afar. After I immersed myself\
  \ enough in the view \u2013 and resisted to not taking pictures since I hadn\u2019\
  t done the entrance ritual \u2013, I took my last steps to the entrance gate of\
  \ Waerebo, and waited for the guide and my friends.\n \n\u201CLet\u2019s ring the\
  \ bell, so the villagers know we\u2019re here\u201D shouted our guide after waiting\
  \ for half an hour. He, then, showed us a bamboo stick and a bigger piece of bamboo\
  \ and began making noise from the pair for three times. He told us to wait for the\
  \ answer from the villagers before we could go. A couple of minutes later, we heard\
  \ the answer, and began to trudge into the village.\n\nAs we got in, we were completely\
  \ astonished by the cultural landscape in front of our eyes. The seven-circular\
  \ cone-shaped houses with great architecture and local material which already a\
  \ hundred years old, the mountains which isolate this village, and of course, the\
  \ villagers. However, our admiration was brought to a sudden halt as our guide took\
  \ us to the main house, Niang Gendang, to meet the chief village finally perform\
  \ our long-awaited entrance ritual\n\n\u201CHere I bring nine guests from Bali,\
  \ and they\u2019re eager to stay in this village. Should we kick off the Wae Lu\u2019\
  u ceremony?\u201D proclaimed our guide to the chief village in local dialect. Meanwhile,\
  \ our minds were already lost in thought contemplating what sort of experiences\
  \ was in hold for us in this ancient and authentic Manggaraian village."
