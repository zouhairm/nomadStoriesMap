Text: "I always knew my great grandfather had been brought to South America as a slave\
  \ from India; but I never knew just how important India would become in my reflection\
  \ of my identity, belonging and heritage. \nAs I arrived in the small village called\
  \ Ujhari, I was greeted by many elders, most of whom spoke a dialect of Urdu or\
  \ Hindi that I didn\u2019t quite understand. One thing that I kept hearing, as if\
  \ being repeated over and over again to me, was the name Zubeida. \nI kept wondering\
  \ to myself, who are they talking about? I was so confused, yet so intrigued by\
  \ this person. Eventually, I asked my mother why these people kept mentioning this\
  \ name to me. Why not to her, or my father, or brother? \nShe laughed at my confusion\
  \ and explained that Zubeida was her aunt, and had visited India when she was a\
  \ young lady. Unfortunately, she caught smallpox and died before she could return\
  \ back to South America. That explained a lot, no wonder I had never met her or\
  \ heard much about her. But still, even after knowing who she was, I had no idea\
  \ why anyone would mention her to me. \nA few days later, when visiting another\
  \ home, there was an old man, and she pointed at me and said something, mentioning\
  \ her name once more. I quickly called over a family member who could translate\
  \ for me; I told him to ask this man what he was trying to tell me. The man stated\
  \ that when Zubeida visited India, he had been her teacher. He was trying to tell\
  \ me that I was just like her. \nAs I began asking questions and trying to find\
  \ out more about who she was, her dreams and aspirations; I began to realize that\
  \ besides my looks and behaviours, I shared many more similarities with her. Our\
  \ love for serving our communities; our dreams to open an orphanage for children\
  \ living on the streets; and our love for history were only a few of the things\
  \ that made me feel as though I had found myself...as though I was seeing myself\
  \ through an entirely new lens. \nWhen I returned to Canada, I asked my grandmother\
  \ if she had a picture of Zubeida, I wanted to see how much I looked like her, considering\
  \ random people who had no idea that I was even related to her were telling me that\
  \ I looked like her, and in all honesty even I was freaked out by how much I resembled\
  \ her. It was like looking at myself 70 years ago, in black and white. \nMy grandma\
  \ told me that the reason why my grandpa favoured me while he was alive was because\
  \ deep down, I always reminded him of his baby sister that he had lost so many decades\
  \ before."
