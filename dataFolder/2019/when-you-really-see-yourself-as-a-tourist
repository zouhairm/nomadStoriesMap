Text: "Once I dreamed about going to Turkey. Everytime you dream about something you\
  \ have high expectations about it. I was absolutely right. Things could not be more\
  \ interesting there.\nThe first place I visited was Cappadocia . It was january.\
  \ It was not the warm and agitated place, that for some reason I had in my mind.\
  \ I saw a completely white Cappadocia. A very calm an unique place. People were\
  \ sweet and seemed to be my best friends ever. At that point of the trip I thought\
  \ nothing could be better. I was wrong.\nWe flew to Istanbul, and there is where\
  \ the magic began. We got there at about 5 pm. As any crazy and anxious tourists,\
  \ my husband and I  ran to enjoy the last few hours of that day. After walking for\
  \ some minutes we heard some bells. We followed the bells, without any clear idea\
  \ of what they were. \nSuddenly we got to Sultanahmet square which is surronded\
  \ by Mosques. It was the very first time in my life I saw myself as a tourist. Everywhere\
  \ I looked I could not understand what was written, everywhere I could hear the\
  \ sound of people singing like praying I could not understand.\nThat was when understanding\
  \ became something unnecessary. Feelling became my priority there. The sensation\
  \ of a huge faith made me feel protected. No matter where we were we always tried\
  \ to end the day at that square.\nOn the following days we could find lots of signs\
  \ in English to guide us wherever we would like to go. We crossed Bosphorus strait\
  \ and got to the Eastern side of the country. \nThe other side is not just a matter\
  \ of geography. It is definetely another country inside Istanbul. People dress like\
  \ we always imagined, there is no English around, turkish is the only language we\
  \ heard. I was sure I was not part of that culture. On the other hand I really wanted\
  \ to stay longer.\nFood was delicious, souvenirs were much more interesting. The\
  \ landscape was colorful and the seagulls, the famous seagulls were everywhere.\n\
  On the following last days we decided to visit the mosques again, but with a guide.\
  \ All around the square people offer guide services. We hired Ecrin.\nThat was another\
  \  moment I saw myself as a real tourist. My husband does not speak English, so\
  \ the guide had to tell evertyhing to me and I translated to my husband. He had\
  \ to look at me. Muslims have a very specifc relatioship with women, specially with\
  \ the ones are not theirs.\nAfter half an hour guiding us inside the Blue Mosque,\
  \ he stopped and apologized. I could not understand why, when he finally explained\
  \ me. He was sorry he could not avoid desiring me. I got desperate. And he calmy\
  \ asked me to tie my hair, because in his culture, the hair is one of the most precious\
  \ treasures a woman can have. Why? because it is how we can seduce a man. What did\
  \ I do? Imeddiately tied my hair. After that, as nothing had happened he kept on\
  \ guiding us with a lot of attention and patience.\nIn short, Turkey was exatly\
  \ like my high expectations made me think. Surprising, delicious, curious, unique,\
  \ mystic, scenical and new. Everything was new to me. Nothing sounded familiar,\
  \ I was a real strange. I was a real tourist, in love for making my dream come true."
