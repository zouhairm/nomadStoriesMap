Text: "The Chapard family and their artist friend Daniel and the family pet, You,\
  \ came in after I sat for my meal at Cafe Daguerre in Montparnasse. European restaurants\
  \ tend to be cozy and nicely decorated. \n\nThe restaurant was bustling, waiters\
  \ hurrying to tables with copious amounts of wine-filled glasses, waiting to be\
  \ savored by their guests. The lights were set to a warm glow, creating an ambiance\
  \ that left the restaurant looking like a scene from a romantic comedy. \n\nIt was\
  \ evening, I met an expat at a tea salon in Butte-Aux-Cailles, in the 13th arrondissement.\
  \ Walked the neighborhood to discover more local street art and the sound of restaurants\
  \ setting up for the happy hour crowd filled the air. Hipsters and women on their\
  \ way to enjoy a Parisian night. \n\nI walked into Franprix, a popular chain of\
  \ grocery stores across Paris, for a quick breakfast before I hopped on the metro\
  \ to Montmartre. \u201CBonjour,\u201D said the shop owner as I walked in, I responded\
  \ in kind and proceeded to the bakery section for pain au jambon and some o.j. I\
  \ sat down ready to enjoy my breakfast in solitude when I realized I hadn\u2019\
  t picked up a napkin. \n\nI looked around the bakery section of the Franprix to\
  \ no avail. So I went looking for an employee to assist me. A young worker, named\
  \ Laila, who appeared to be in her early 20s was wiping down a counter when I approached\
  \ her, saying \u201CBonjour! Vous parlez anglais?\u201D to which she sheepishly\
  \ replied \u201CBonjour, Madame! D\xE9sol\xE9e.\u201D \n\nMy brain tried to remember\
  \ the word for napkin in French and all I could come up with was \u201Csevette,\u201D\
  \ which in Haitian Creole means napkin. Laila had no idea what I was saying. Not\
  \ the exact cognate I\u2019d been hoping for, so I resorted to pantomiming as I\
  \ motioned wiping my mouth with an invisible napkin. The things you do to to communicate\
  \ when you\u2019re in a foreign country make for the best stories. Finally a breakthrough.\
  \ \u201CAhhh, oui. D\u2019accord, un mouchoir,\u201D said Laila. We both chuckled\
  \ after Laila brought me a napkin.\n\nI asked Laila if she was in college and she\
  \ said she couldn\u2019t afford the carpentry courses so she got a job at Franprix.\
  \ I was interested in her story after she told me that she hadn\u2019t seen her\
  \ mom since she was 10. She said she was 19 and living in \u201Cfamille d\u2019\
  accueil\u201D which is foster care in France. As Laila continued her facial expression\
  \ changed to a more pensive look. I told her that my parents had died when I was\
  \ young, my dad died when I was 6 and my mom passed away when I was 19. We had something\
  \ in common. \n\nThe pain of losing a parent changes you forever. But for Laila\
  \ her unstable family life caused the French government to place her in foster care.\
  \ I was crushed to have learned her story. I gave her my number and promised I would\
  \ keep in touch. \n\nThe next day, I called Laila and told her I had an extra ticket\
  \ to see Pauline Croze at Les \xC9toiles. She agreed to meet me at the concert venue.\
  \ We enjoyed the show and I am so happy that this serendipitous meeting at Franprix\
  \ connected me to people I count as friends today."
