Text: "Zimbabwean born but British raised, I have seen very little of Africa within\
  \ my time. My memories of the continent involve various airports as connecting flights\
  \ for journeys that lead me back to Zimbabwe once every few years, then of course\
  \ the savanna lands of Zimbabwe, the dusty country roads that lead to the family\
  \ farm and bottle stores you can collect fuel for the generator from. Otherwise,\
  \ Africa is still unventured lands, so when presented with the opportunity to travel\
  \ to Morocco I leapt at the chance. I found myself venturing on my own amongst a\
  \ group of strangers from all over the world. \nAs my eyes met the coast on the\
  \ ferry, I felt at ease, it was like I had found myself at home. But what was to\
  \ follow was nothing like it. \n\nFrom camel rides along the beach, watching the\
  \ waves crash against the sand and rock and touring through caves with glints of\
  \ light shining through; the excitement had only just begun. As we journey through\
  \ the streets of Tangier, there was a sense of familiarity. The roads and buildings\
  \ stood akin to those of the streets of Harare; the way the traffic moved and the\
  \ way that pedestrians and vehicles interacted. The noise and bustling city had\
  \ engaged me and the connection was to only grow stronger.\n\nMy favourite experience\
  \ in my short stay was the tour of the Blue Cities. Our tour guide, a middle aged\
  \ Moroccan man guided us through the hilly cities through market places and restaurants.\
  \ Till this day I think the only person that can convince me to buy a 'student carpet'\
  \ would be a Moroccan market man. \n\nDuring that tour, I spoke with the guide often\
  \ and he asked me where I was from. My initial answer is typically England as by\
  \ nationality I am British and have lived in England for the majority of my life,\
  \ but he asked where in Africa and I responded with Zimbabwe. A smile beamed from\
  \ his face and he embraced me and said 'Welcome home sister'. I was pleasantly shocked,\
  \ my notions of Morocco had never been tied to Africa. As a country within the continent,\
  \ yes, but as somewhere I could feel loved and accepted, no. Then it played over\
  \ in my head, the trip so far had given me image bites of a life I've seen before,\
  \ but of course with the added extra of differently spiced food, a different religion\
  \ and interest leisure activities. And as the trip proceeded, I noticed more and\
  \ more the welcoming nature of my Moroccan brothers and sisters, and became more\
  \ comfortable with the locals. Every trip we made in the following days, I would\
  \ exchange greetings and on occasions share embraces. Morocco showed me that differences\
  \ are normal and can make us feel separated, however, we should always embrace them\
  \ because greater things come out of that."
