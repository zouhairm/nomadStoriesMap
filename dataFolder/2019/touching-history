Text: "I stood in the center of a tilled field in rural France with the sun staring\
  \ at my neck as I grasped a handful of rusted stake flags and stared at the upheaval\
  \ of earth at my feet. I was two inches from stepping on history. \n\nThe hillside\
  \ field just barely overlooked the medieval walled town of Marsal, a tiny all but\
  \ forgotten relic with its foundations dating back to the Bronze Age when life was\
  \ fueled by the ancient salt trade. It was home to 285 people, a couple herds of\
  \ dairy cows, and at lest three rival gangs of chickens. And for six steaming summer\
  \ weeks, it was home to a rag-tag, dirt-encrusted troupe of wide-eyed, hopeful archaeologists\
  \ who grew together within the town\u2019s cracks.\n\nWe were roughly a week and\
  \ a half out from completing our internship. We could see it in our mismatched tan\
  \ lines, feel it in every stiff sleeping turn on our army cots, and taste it in\
  \ the by now familiar grit of dirt between our teeth. We had been digging, cleaning,\
  \ sorting, and counting briquetage until our minds were numb to the wonder of ancient\
  \ salt ovens and rubbish piles. \n\nOur leaders gave us a reprieve in the form of\
  \ field-walking the hilltop sanctuary site for a third time since the start of the\
  \ program. We hadn\u2019t found much from our first two passes earlier in the season,\
  \ and other than a longer stretch of our legs and rest for our weary knees, expectations\
  \ were low. We passed around the pink and green plastic flags, as stiff on their\
  \ metal poles as we were in our shoes, and lined up ten feet apart. By now our team\
  \ of twenty-five interns knew which knots of earth could hold our weight and which\
  \ ones would cave in and twist our ankles. We had learned the exact slow rate at\
  \ which to turn our heads as our eyes systematically searched the ground. We walked\
  \ in reverent silence, the treads of our boots grasping for purchase between the\
  \ long and haunting caverns of soil.\n\nI was there because I sought a connection\
  \ with history, had wanted to be there when the past reemerged, to touch it, to\
  \ somehow add a piece of myself to its small hold on being just slightly less than\
  \ eternal. Artifacts could last beyond lifetimes, and I fancied the idea of some\
  \ part of me, some part of my story, doing the same.  \n\nThe muddled sea-green\
  \ tint peeking out low from the ground made me pause. It was hesitant to be noticed,\
  \ but asking for attention all the same. I rubbed my thumb and forefinger together,\
  \ perhaps as much for luck as to shed any residual dirt that had housed itself between\
  \ the creases of my skin. I bent down, touching a knee to the well-packed ridge\
  \ of earth housing my curiosity. I gingerly ran my finger over the exposed rim,\
  \ allowing it to guide my efforts in its tiny excavation. \n\nThe coin was faded\
  \ against my palm, looking worn and disgruntled with the lack of uniformity along\
  \ its edges and the vague impression of a horse stamped slightly off center. For\
  \ a brief second, I felt as if we were the only two in all of time and space - me\
  \ and that little coin. \n\nOver two thousand years ago, someone had cast and stamped\
  \ the metal. Someone had carried it with them across the continent. Someone had\
  \ paused here on this hill and braced their arm against the sun as summer sweat\
  \ beaded atop their skin. Someone had bowed down, pressed their knees into the dirt,\
  \ and thanked the gods for their good fortune.\n\nI staked the ground at my feet,\
  \ placed the coin next to where I had freed it from its past, and stood. I had found\
  \ a piece of history and had touched it with my bare hands. I had become an irrevocable\
  \ part of its existence."
