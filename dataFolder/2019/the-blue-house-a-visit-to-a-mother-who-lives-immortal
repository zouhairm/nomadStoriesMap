Text: "She lived in colors and tragedy; bold red and glittery gold. Holding her red\
  \ book, she was wearing leather corset and a tehuana skirt, in the frame imprinted\
  \ on her house. Who was she?\n\nCoyoac\xE1n, a cultural hub in Mexico City, on the\
  \ weekend offered a bunch of options to explore indigenous sides of Mexico. Among\
  \ bars, traditional markets and local performances, her house was the chosen one;\
  \ Museo Frida Kahlo. From the outside it was a fortress consists of striking blue\
  \ wall and gigantic green door with such a long queue.\n\nAs I stepped up the corridor\
  \ stairs and got in the building of the left area, I was depicted to who is she\
  \ from her fashion style; an eccentric and modest woman. She loved to wear those\
  \ beautiful Mexican traditional dresses but what appealed me the most from those\
  \ attributes was the crutches. It was a bus accident\u2014painted her skin with\
  \ blood and gold glittery powder exhibiting a terrible beauty just like the characteristics\
  \ of her artwork. Her name, Frida Kahlo, is famous for surrealism painting which\
  \ is not only a media to express but also to criticize, in other words to make a\
  \ movement.\n\nStrolling the greenery yard decorated with some aztec statues I then\
  \ got in the second building; a shelter where she used to sleep, paint, cook and\
  \ even host a big figure like Leon Trotsky. Frida Kahlo and her beloved husband\
  \ Diego Rivera, also an artist and social activist, always open their door for everyone\
  \ to share kindness. This house shared warmth and brought the visitors to a beautiful\
  \ nostalgic of simple life; the furniture, the painting equipment even the earthenware\
  \ in the kitchen, made me gaze in amazement.\n\nPulmonary embolism took her life\
  \ away but she is still here. She never dies. Living in her painting and her zeal.\
  \ This house unsilenced her ideology and her partiality to the marginals. Frida\
  \ never gave birth but the generations who embrace her spirit is her successor,\
  \ her children, that is not limited by citizenship and background are the people\
  \ who will continue her fight. Her legacy in the form of art will never run out.\
  \ Moreover, her diary, those are sold in the form of book, would be able to share\
  \ her romantic life through her colorful rustic drawings from surrealist to idealist.\n\
  \nShe still lives in her everlasting artwork.\n\nStepping out from her house, I\
  \ still had a fortnight stay in Mexico to uncover other local uniqueness. I never\
  \ thought I would have a chance like this, to be introduced to great mother through\
  \ her lively residence. Eventually, I was conscious that in the travel journey a\
  \ lot of unexpected things always happen!"
