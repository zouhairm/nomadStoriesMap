Text: "After nearly three weeks of hiking, we reached the highest monastery in the\
  \ world: Tengboche, Nepal. I wanted to go to Everest Base Camp. Barrett wanted to\
  \ become a monk. While this is normally something that takes years to do, within\
  \ a week, he had shaved his hair, gotten a job in the little town shop selling toilet\
  \ paper and Coca-Cola to tourists, and began his quest to translate Sherpa into\
  \ English. He would sit at his desk in the shack all day scribbling down little\
  \ bits of Sherpa he learned from those that lived there. He made friends with all\
  \ of the monks and villagers. While many people passed through this small town of\
  \ three or four buildings each day on their way to Everest, few stayed for more\
  \ than a day or two. Barrett was different. By the end of his stay all 13 residents\
  \ and even some traveling monks would know him by name and truly appreciate his\
  \ presence. He was even given a name by the monks, which I cannot share. And to\
  \ his delight, upon leaving the village, he was bestowed a yellow sash, something\
  \ reserved in their culture for those that are loved dearly. \n\n     He learned\
  \ that the culture of the Sherpa people is different than the Nepalese. Their humor\
  \ is a more subtle shade of poking fun, while still laughing with, and possibly\
  \ at you. Their work ethic steadfast, and their generosity limitless. The little\
  \ bakery where Barrett got his job paid him in hot chocolate in the mornings, and\
  \ pie in the afternoon. The shop owner would bring it to him with a little smile.\
  \ She was a very sweet woman but ran a tight shop. Barrett seemed to be an exception.\
  \ She seemed to like him. \n\n      Everyone that lived in the village knew it was\
  \ strange for someone to take this keen of an interest in Tengboche, but they were\
  \ honored by it, and excited at the same time. The little shack he worked in was\
  \ attached to the side of a brick building built out of materials the villagers\
  \ had gathered over time. It was by no means nice, but it kept the rain out, and\
  \ the Pringles somewhat safe from rats. Of which there were many. I know this because\
  \ I slept between those walls for a night, which was one too many. The morning after\
  \ I saw those little black shapes scuttle across the floor beneath my cot, and between\
  \ the walls, I went on my way up the mountain, without Barrett, to Everest. \n\n\
  \     He stayed behind to build a home and learn from a culture. He wasn\u2019t\
  \ paid in money, but something much more valuable. He appreciated the great opportunity\
  \ he had to learn and explore their culture. He loved walking  with the head monks\
  \ around the stupas. And meditating each morning with the monks at the monastery.\
  \ He would help them with their duties, searching for lost yaks and fallen prayer\
  \ flags out on the mountain side. Crossing the rocky rivers and hiking mountainous\
  \ trails that were scattered about Tengboche. He came to know the area better than\
  \ most.\n\n     While I thought I was having the adventure of a lifetime, going\
  \ up to Mount Everest alone, I realized later I was completely mistaken. Truth is,\
  \ the best adventures are right in front of you. The people we are surrounded by.\
  \ Take a moment and experience the places you visit, instead of experiencing what\
  \ you think you should. The true adventure is made up of the people you meet, the\
  \ experiences you share and the lives you affect. Remember this as you climb your\
  \ Everest. After weeks separated from Barrett, I came back to a village full of\
  \ people that already knew me by name and were excited to meet me. They said \u201C\
  Barrett has told us so much about you.\u201D While I may have hiked a mountain,\
  \ Barrett won the hearts of a people. And because of their love of him, they loved\
  \ me too. The last day we were in Tengboche, the shop owner came up to me, smiled\
  \ with her kind eyes, and bowed as she placed a yellow sash around my shoulders."
