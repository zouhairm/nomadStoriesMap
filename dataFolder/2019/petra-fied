Text: "I can't quite fit through the crack in the rock face with my backpack on. I\
  \ remove it carefully and pass it up to the bedouin boy, hoping that my footing\
  \ is secure enough not to fall down the steep cliff we are climbing. I refuse to\
  \ look down, knowing that doing so would shatter any chances of making it to the\
  \ top.\n\nThis is absolutely not the route I had planned.\n\n\u200BEarlier that\
  \ day \u2026\n\nWe elbow our way through masses of people, camels, and donkeys.\
  \ Above us looms the Treasury, Petra\u2019s most famous landmark. Three thousand\
  \ years ago, the Nabataeans intricately chiseled this stunning structure deep into\
  \ the pink sandstone rock face. Now, with recognition as one of the \u201Cnew seven\
  \ wonders of the world,\u201D Petra draws visitors from near and far. We dodge selfie\
  \ sticks as we make our way to the hiking trail.\n\n\u200BPetra is home to some\
  \ bedouin people, many of whom operate the vending stalls and arrange camel and\
  \ donkey rides. We are followed for a section of the trail by a young bedouin boy,\
  \ probably no older than seven. His clothes are ragged, his feet are bare, and he\
  \ persistently asks us for money and biscuits. Signs instruct tourists not to encourage\
  \ children selling trinkets and asking for money as they should be in school instead\
  \ of begging in the park. I am more saddened than annoyed at the persistence of\
  \ this boy.\n\nWe follow the main trail until we are addressed by a Jack Sparrow\
  \ look-a-like on a donkey. We tell him we are headed to the Monastery, arguably\
  \ Petra's most awe-inspiring monument. He suggests to us an alternate route that\
  \ will take us along another trail through the mountains and past a spring. He claims\
  \ it will take us the same amount of time as following the main trail but will afford\
  \ much nicer views.\n\nNever trust strange men on donkeys.\n\n\u200BAfter following\
  \ the trail for about forty five minutes, it disappears. We have seen only one human\
  \ and a herd of goats during this time. Eventually, we encounter two bedouin boys,\
  \ roughly fourteen and ten years of age, and another Jack Sparrow look-a-like with\
  \ a donkey. They give us confusing and conflicting information about the location\
  \ of the Monastery and the likelihood of reaching it on this trail. With the fourteen-year-old\
  \ bedouin as our guide, we decide to take our chances and push forward.\n\nThere\
  \ is no defined trail. We follow a narrow ledge on the side of the mountain over\
  \ uneven terrain. Our guide makes our route sound straightforward: \"Just follow\
  \ here and up there and then Monastery is there. Five minutes.\" Ok. We hike on.\
  \ No Monastery in sight. Now it's: \"Just over here and then we climb and then Monastery\
  \ is there. No problem. Five minutes.\" Ok. Keep going.\n\n\u200BWe reach the cliff\
  \ face we are meant to climb. \u200BIt\u2019s high and it\u2019s steep. My palms\
  \ start to sweat as my fear of heights kicks in. At this point, there is no turning\
  \ back. I begin to climb. As I gain height, I make a very conscious effort not to\
  \ look down. Behind us, the mountains fade away to desert. The view is phenomenal,\
  \ but I dare not look. As I reach the top, the view of the Monastery is the most\
  \ welcome sight I have ever seen. \"See?\" our guide says. \"No problem. I get you\
  \ here. I forget my business for you.\" We thank him profusely and hand him several\
  \ dinars for his time.\n\nThe Monastery towers over us. This monument is even more\
  \ grand than the Treasury, showcasing the skill of ancient builders in its detail\
  \ and placement so far back in the rock face. Weary visitors rest on chairs by a\
  \ snack stand with bottles of water. We scoff. They took the easy way up.\n\nThe\
  \ way down along the main trail takes us several hours. We are badgered by more\
  \ Jack Sparrow characters selling donkey and camel rides back to the Treasury. We\
  \ decline. We are intent to walk our way back. The sun sets as we wearily tread\
  \ towards the exit with the last of Petra's visitors."
