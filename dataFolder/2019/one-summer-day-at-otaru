Text: "It was one hot summer day on 2018, when my husband and I decided to take a\
  \ day trip to Otaru. Hokkaido had always been on my bucket list ever since I watched\
  \ a travel vlog about the island. One thing I would like to try the most? The famous\
  \ fried chicken at Otaru. We took rapid train from Sapporo Station. Along the journey,\
  \ I could see beautiful blue sea and bright sky from the train window. Sometimes\
  \ the view shifted to traditional Japanese housings, which lined so harmoniously.\
  \ It was a short 30 minutes trip from Sapporo to Otaru. The station itself had a\
  \ very different feel to the ones at Japan\u2019s big cities like Tokyo or Osaka.\
  \ It was small and had an old-times feel with decorative ceiling and small glass\
  \ ventilations. We took a map of the city in English. \n\nEverything in Otaru was\
  \ within walking distance. It would have been more perfect day for walking though\
  \ if only the weather was not so boiling. While waiting for lunch hour, we decided\
  \ to walk around for a bit. The city had totally different vibe to metropolitan\
  \ Tokyo. Everything was in a slower pace. The buildings on the main streets had\
  \ old Western style with many small shops along the street selling handicraft, glass\
  \ art, ceramics and many others. We stopped by one popular photo site of H.K. Porter\
  \ & Co\u2019s Railroad monument. A few steps further, we spotted a very vibrant\
  \ shop selling fresh Hokkaido\u2019s rock melon. Who could resist creamy melon ice\
  \ cream with sweet melon cuts on top of it on a burning hot weather? It was just\
  \ heaven. \n\nAfter about 20 minutes walking along the main road, we could start\
  \ catching a glimpse of grey-bricks warehouse buildings with bright blue roof. And\
  \ not far from those buildings, finally we arrived at the most famous tourist spot\
  \ of the city: Otaru Canal. There were professional photographers ready to help\
  \ tourists taking beautiful pictures. However, we did not use their service since\
  \ we were \u2018bartering\u2019 to take picture with one Philippines\u2019 couple.\
  \ The photo taken by the husband was pretty nice. It was as if we were on an breezy\
  \ day with clear blue sky above us and calm stream behind us. The real deal was\
  \ we were sweating like crazy. But worry not, after enjoying the canal, there were\
  \ food stalls inside nearby warehouses selling cold beers and some Japanese bites.\
  \ \n\nThe final mission was of course to find the chicken! The restaurant location\
  \ was printed on the map we took earlier at the Station. But to make sure, we were\
  \ using Google Map help. We continued our walk to Sakaimachi Street, where tourists\
  \ could find many cafes and souvenir shops. It was a lively area with pretty traditional\
  \ decorations. We just passed through it, since it was already passed midday and\
  \ we had not had a proper meal yet. We kept walking on the sidewalk, following the\
  \ given direction. Sweat was drenching our clothes and the sun was burning on top\
  \ of our heads. When we spotted a Bank of Japan Museum on the opposite road, we\
  \ decided to walk inside \u2013 just to look for air conditioner!\n\nOne hour passed.\
  \ We seemed to have walked everywhere looking for the restaurant. We arrived to\
  \ the destination mentioned on Google Map, only to find an abandoned building. Some\
  \ locals said they had moved to new location.  To give up now would be wrong, since\
  \ we had wasted so many hours. As we had reached what looked like the end of road\
  \ \u2013 the neighborhood was very empty, so we decided to make a detour. Just when\
  \ we almost gave up and walked back to train station, there it was! We saw big banner\
  \ with a chicken logo on top of a building. We found it: Naruto Honten! The fried\
  \ chicken was even better than what I had expected. It was just a simple fried chicken\
  \ seasoned with a little salt and pepper, served with hot rice. We ordered Ice Cola\
  \ for drinks. Nothing could ever beat the combo of crispy chicken and cold cola\
  \ on a hot summer day!"
