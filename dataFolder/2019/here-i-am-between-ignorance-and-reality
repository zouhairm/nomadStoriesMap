Text: "For the past few weeks, I have wandered between realms of ignorance and reality.\
  \  My role as a tourist, as a student, and as a local has immersed me into one sphere,\
  \ then forcefully dragged me into another.  Each sphere lives its own separate life,\
  \ yet social and political consequences successfully transcend these borders.  As\
  \ a tourist, I have gasped and awed at the picturesque South Africa.  The mountains\
  \ have been climbed.  The restaurants have been visited.  The tickets for adventure\
  \ have been paid for.  As a tourist, I have the money and the time to experience\
  \ the luxurious \u2014 and predominately white populated \u2014 areas of South Africa.\
  \  Here, I live in a sphere of ignorance.  \n\tLiving in a homestay, I have been\
  \ pushed into the life of a local \u2014 to a life beyond beautiful pictures.  I\
  \ have lived with families who have very real struggles of gentrification, land\
  \ rights, and economic opportunity.  These struggles are no longer ignored.  They\
  \ are real and immediate.  As a local, I see how the oppressed overcome hardships\
  \ to find dignity and humanity.  Here, I live in a sphere of reality.    \n\nFrom\
  \ 1948 to 1991, South African citizens lived under an oppressive Apartheid regime.\
  \  In an attempt to make Cape Town an all-whites city, people were categorized according\
  \ to their race.  These classifications determined everything.  If you were not\
  \ white, you were forced to live in the outskirts of the city.  If you were not\
  \ white, your daily movement was restricted and monitored.  If you were not white,\
  \ manual labor jobs were your only economic opportunity.  If you were not white,\
  \ you were classified as a child and treated like so.  You did not vote.  You did\
  \ not own land.  This was the law.  And if you did not obey the law, you were subject\
  \ to brutal whippings or execution.\n\tIn 1991, the Apartheid government \u201C\
  peacefully\u201D ceased power after years of protest from the African National Congress\
  \ (ANC).  I simplify this cession of the Apartheid government which includes stories\
  \ of brave South Africans, powerful and peaceful protests, violence, and international\
  \ relations.  Instead, I wish to concentrate on a less popular topic \u2014 South\
  \ Africa\u2019s expectation of democracy versus its reality.  \n\tIn 1994, the ANC\
  \ came to power.  Nelson Mandela was elected President of the newly formed South\
  \ African democracy.  The ANC passed a progressive and powerful constitution, granting\
  \ all its citizens the right to health, education, water, and housing.  And land\
  \ \u2014 its redistribution was mentioned in the constitution.  Though to this day,\
  \ land redistribution has still no explicit plans for change.  \n\tThis brings me\
  \ to where I am today, the rural community of Zweletemba, a former blacks only township\
  \ created during Apartheid.  The 200,000 people of Zweletemba are unique in their\
  \ stories, but not in their struggles.  \n\tIn the center of the neighborhood, most\
  \ roads are paved and houses are constructed in neat, straight lines.  Electricity\
  \ poles stand erect.  Hidden pipes bring water to homes.  Children jump rope on\
  \ the dusty roads.  Dogs roam looking for attention.  But as you move to the outskirts\
  \ of the town, electricity poles become more and more rare.  Outdoor public toilets\
  \ become the only source of plumbing.  Houses take the form of four walls constructed\
  \ of sheet metal.  Zweletemba is a neighborhood of subsidized government housing.\
  \  In extreme circumstances, families construct a house out of the supplies they\
  \ have, apply for government housing, and wait.  After many years, the government\
  \ finally constructs the housing -- it so plainly labels as a human right -- for\
  \ the family. \n\nIn 1991, whites were greatly advantaged.  Then in 1994, all races\
  \ were granted political, economic, and social equality.  Opportunity was now available\
  \ to all.  But, there is a tragic flaw in this logic.  When someone starts a marathon\
  \ 10 miles ahead of you, how are you expected to finish at the same time, let alone\
  \ within the same hour?  This is the reality for many.  As a tourist, student, and\
  \ local, I have the privilege to move out of this sphere of reality.  With this\
  \ privilege, it is my responsibility to use my voice for empowerment, equity, and\
  \ activism."
