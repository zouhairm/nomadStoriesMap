Text: "What one can expect from a Sunny day in July in Milano, lots of tourists at\
  \ Duomo taking pictures, Mc Donald\u2019s full with people around the globe and\
  \ you can hear 7 different languages in your 10 metres proximity.Girls swarming\
  \ at H&M and Zara like bees in San Babila, looking for that chic dress to try for\
  \ the Milano Nightlife with clubs full of models and foreigners. \nYes, I expected\
  \ all these ,I planned to visit all the  tourist attraction , planned to check out\
  \ nightlife after spending 15 minutes  on google and going through  instagram pages\
  \ of the clubs,and maybe also to find some tourists from the Couchsurfing  app and\
  \ go for a walk around Arco Della and Navigilio.\nThough I was in different mood\
  \ that day ,I was trying to talk to everyone in metro ,trams even if they were frowning\
  \ straight on my face,and then this random dude came to me and asked if I have a\
  \ cigarette, Travel tip -if u have extra cigarette in Italy,you can make lots of\
  \ friends. This dude was shorter than me, wearing shorts and Tshirt in the middle\
  \ of the day on a Friday and normally I would have said no, and passed on, but thank\
  \ to god I had an extra cigarette that day because my whole way to travel and my\
  \ perspective of life was about to change,\nI got in talking with this guy for the\
  \ whole metro ride and he invited me for aperitivo with his another friend in evening\
  \ . Aperitivo is pre dinner drink deeply engraved in Italian daily lives, where\
  \ people get together at their favorite bar and only pay for the drink and get the\
  \ buffet full of food for free with it.\nAs the evening approaches, I started getting\
  \ skeptical and feeling weird of this whole meet up with this random dude for aperitivo,\
  \ but again I was in different mood that day,I wanted to take chances,so I went\
  \ anyway. I reached a Bar named Turne at Porta venezia ,and I was in awe at looking\
  \ the vibe of the place, it was very crowded ,people in groups chatting outside\
  \ the bar with drinks in their hand ,different groups of people just mingling with\
  \ other groups of people in lightly dimmed very hip looking place.\nMe, Luigi and\
  \ Pier took a table outside the bar with drinks in our hand exchanging stories,\
  \ talking when two very British and very drunk guys joined our table and started\
  \ making plans to go to Lake como together the next day. But one of those guys realized\
  \ one thing that I didn\u2019t noticed, Luigi looked  exactly like Prince Harry,and\
  \ he told us that his heart broke when Meghan markle got married.So we did the most\
  \ obvious thing that one can do to console a Drunk guy, we convinced him to get\
  \ a tattoo of Meghan Markle on his arm the same night,and we DID IT!\n\nOur night\
  \ continued with me,Luigi and Pier taking three sharing cycles from the street ,exploring\
  \  Milano from the tram parking area of Milan to darkest of streets with creative\
  \  graffitis ,then we reached a building name BASE, which is a cultural center for\
  \ meetings and presentations, but on Friday night, it\u2019s underground parking\
  \ is a Nightclub. We entered into the parking which gave me Fast and furious Tokyo\
  \ drift type feelings and there I saw crowd full of local Milano people  grooving\
  \ to the remix of Karma Chameleon and YMCA .We danced all night ,expanded our group\
  \ to 10 people. I learned the song Bella Ciao which is a revolutionary song in Italy\
  \ and we all chorused on the streets after the club looking for something to eat\
  \ at 3a.m.\nThe night was amazing for me and changed my way of travelling.After\
  \ that, traveling for me is not visiting places and clicking photographs, For me\
  \ it is taking chances, getting out of your comfort zone, trying to make new connections\
  \ with people, trying to get an inside view of the life of Locals by asking them\
  \ to let you into their real life stories. Travelling for me is creating millions\
  \ of memories with awesome human beings of the world."
