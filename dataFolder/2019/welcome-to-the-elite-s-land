Text: "I never thought that making a local connection in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\
  \ was very easy. I traveled with my mother because my mother needs a companion to\
  \ do something. Arrived in Prince Mohammed Bin Abdul Aziz International Airport\
  \ with small groups of people, straight to the bus and left the airport. It\u2019\
  s a quite nice airport, clean and we can find many shops although they\u2019re closed\
  \ at 1 a.m. in the morning. The airport is totally different from Jeddah International\
  \ Airport in 2007. \n\nI stayed in a 5 stars hotel near the holy mosque. It took\
  \ only 5 minutes\u2019 walk and surrounded by many local shops and well-known coffee\
  \ shops or restaurants such as Baskin and Robbins, Dunkin Donuts, and even Starbucks.\
  \ Local shops sell various products, if you want to buy something, I will give you\
  \ a suggestion to buy gold. The Middle East is famous for its gold, their gold is\
  \ different from our gold. That\u2019s something we won\u2019t regret.\n\nPeople\
  \ think that we have to speak Arabic if we want to go there. This time, it\u2019\
  s easy to find directions or even speaking with the people in English. At least\
  \ they understand how to answer our questions. If you\u2019re afraid about the people,\
  \ well don\u2019t be. They\u2019re as friendly as we are, as long as we give respect\
  \ to their values and traditions. Mingle with people around us always be the best\
  \ options. If we can\u2019t mingle with people, we\u2019d better learn from refugee\
  \ kid who hugs me suddenly near the mosque. The kid told me that she came from Syria,\
  \ with her brother and father. Her father sells perfumes and the kids help her father.\
  \ They live near my hotel and its store is between my hotel and the holy mosque.\
  \ \nI didn\u2019t like the smell of the perfume, it made me dizzy, but I bought\
  \ it to help her getting her 10 riyals to buy ice cream. She couldn\u2019t just\
  \ ask for it to her father, she must sell something first. Well. I agree with that,\
  \ teaching your kids as an entrepreneur since the very beginning and let them learn\
  \ between needs and wants. \n\nAfter buying perfume from a cute little girl, I walked\
  \ to the store next to my hotel. Most of them sell clothes and jewelry. Fortunately,\
  \ most of them speak Indonesian. The owner of the store told me that his employees\
  \ speak Indonesian, English, and Arabic. Some of his stores employ Indonesian students.\
  \ He said that\u2019s the effective method to transfer languages and using English\
  \ as intermediary language or a bridge language. When I asked him why using English\
  \ not Indonesian, he said that google translate using English, so it\u2019s easy\
  \ for Google to understand another language if the intermediary language is English.\
  \ We both laughed and he gave me his named card. I looked at it and I read that\
  \ he also sells camel\u2019s heart! He said that many people believe that a camel\u2019\
  s heart can cure disease and camel\u2019s meat is healthier than other red meat.\
  \ Well, thank you, I\u2019m not a fan of red meat, I prefer salmon fish and dory\
  \ fish for sure. I\u2019m a white meat lover!   \n\nTraveling to the land where\
  \ most people are afraid to come doesn\u2019t scare me. Madinah is one of the holy\
  \ places for Muslim. Forbidden for other religions. Muslim from all over the world\
  \ come and gather together as a family to pray. So when we hear bad news about something,\
  \ we\u2019d better try to see it from many perspectives or different angles because\
  \ maybe it\u2019s our fault insist to implement our thought without giving our respect\
  \ to their values, rules, and tradition. The world needs people who can give their\
  \ respect over values and understanding without judging."
