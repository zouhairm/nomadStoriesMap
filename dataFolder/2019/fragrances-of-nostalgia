Text: "If people associate the Japanese town of Nara with deers, I associate it with\
  \ a group of three adorable old ladies, a stand of handmade objects in the courtyard\
  \ of a building and lots of camera flashes.\n\nIt is 10 o'clock in the morning when\
  \ I leave Nara station, with the certainty of being able to reach the park at the\
  \ foot of Mount Wakakusa. But around 12 pm confidence is about to leave me: the\
  \ green mountain is always in front of me, yet it always seems too far. I tell myself\
  \ that it would be better for me to go on a guided tour, to get on a shuttle at\
  \ least, to be sure of reaching the park \u2013 instead I take a turn for a gravel\
  \ road. To be honest, I do it because there are cherry blossoms on both sides, I\
  \ hope to get to the deer. I actually do, but with one (not too) small detour. There\
  \ are three old women in a front yard, the first people I see in nearly an hour,\
  \ someone I can finally ask for directions. It is not language barriers that prevent\
  \ us from communicating, also because they seemed to be looking forward to meeting\
  \ someone from Naples, the city of pizza. Pizza suddenly becomes more important\
  \ than any deer in town.\n\nNoriko, Kaiya and Yoshiko set up a stand once a month,\
  \ they sell items which they sew or paint themselves\u2013 paperweights, jewelry\
  \ boxes, toys which they put in display in the courtyard of the building they live\
  \ in. They explain it to me, while we have tea together at Yoshiko's. Her daughter\
  \ is the only one who is the most fluent at English and now she is looking on Google\
  \ Maps for the best way to go to Nara Park. In fact I already forgot I have to go\
  \ there. I get involved with their stories, that passion for pizza pervading them\
  \ and also the genuine satisfaction of meeting some from Naples for the first time.\
  \ It is a surprise for me as well to be in a small square apartment with pink walls\
  \ (Yoshiko's favorite color), sitting at the table with three ladies in their 70s\
  \ talking about yeast, dough mozzarella related to some old lady's past experience.\
  \ But I have already become their darling Bianca, I realize, when they all asks\
  \ me to take a picture with them, using phones or old-fashioned film cameras. Before\
  \ I know, Yoshiko is looking out the window in the kitchen and is inviting her neighbors\
  \ over to meet Bianca, the girl from the pizza city. Yoshiko's daughter is embarrassed,\
  \ but I tell her I am not bothered, because in the city of the deer park you can\
  \ also talk about pizza, and I am clearly ready to satisfy their curiosity.\n\n\
  So many photos of me are taken at Yoshiko's house, but the stories I hear, those\
  \ are even more. There are mostly people in their 70s around me, almost no one has\
  \ left Nara during their lives, except for some short holiday within the State.\
  \ And if they say that my adventures in the city of pizza are the most extraordinary\
  \ stories they have ever heard, I think their lives exude smells just as tasty.\
  \ As much as the scent of genmaicha tea, a green tea mixed with roasted rice, which\
  \ the bottom of my cup now bears only a paltry track.\n\nIt is three in the afternoon,\
  \ I am on the road again, ready to follow the path suggested by Yoshiko's daughter.\
  \ And I no longer care about being late, in Naples we are not really people fond\
  \ of schedules, Noriko laughs when I tell her. It is about cultural differences,\
  \ Kaiya points out, but this does not mean that our ears cannot be echoing distant\
  \ stories. This is probably way there is a well-framed picture of me on the kitchen\
  \ wall, between the window overlooking a cherry tree blooming every spring and the\
  \ stove, where Yoshiko, Noriko and Kaiya practice kneading and cooking pizza, so\
  \ that the smell can travel the world and reach me, the girl from the pizza city."
