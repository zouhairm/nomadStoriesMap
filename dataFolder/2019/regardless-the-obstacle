Text: "Yes I like , love & adore Travelling and I almost could say that I live to\
  \ travel, I go every day to work ,engaging with everyday life struggle to earn my\
  \ livings & to save money to travel. And yes I know that travelling is my gate of\
  \ happiness as I like to describe it. And yes my friends and fellow travelers see\
  \ that I have the \"traveler spirit\xB4\" if we can say such a term.\n\nBut what\
  \ I did not expect to find were two things, the first was that I am traveling addict\
  \ that much, addict to the limit that can jeopardize my health to be able to travel\
  \ & not to miss a travelling chance, So I could describe it that I am an addict\
  \ with no limits. And simply here is the story, I had booked flight tickets, hotel\
  \ accommodation and get a tourist visa to visit Russia, even I had booked a domestic\
  \ flight tickets to see and visit not only Moscow but also saint peters-burg as\
  \ well, besides booking a Bolshoi show. Only five days remaining until my traveling\
  \ date & suddenly a car accident with a broken knee as a consequence this demanded\
  \ a surgery of Screw Stripping to fix the fracture.\nI asked the doctor could I\
  \ postpone the surgery for two weeks ? He answered \"yes but I do not recommend\
  \ this \" Then I asked him again after explaining him my plan so do you think that\
  \ I can travel?  And his astonish reply was \"Yes you can but without walking on\
  \ your injured  leg at all & either to use a stick or a wheelchair \"\nAnd without\
  \ thinking anymore I found myself had made my decision I will travel & I will not\
  \ cancel the journey. \nYou could imagine how hard to convince my parents to travel\
  \ in such a case but I succeeded & I found that my Travelling passion & addiction\
  \ is more than what I had expected in myself or in other words \" I did not expect\
  \ to find myself has travelling limitless addiction that much\"\nSo that was the\
  \ first thing that I did not expect to find, the second one was Russian people and\
  \ how helpful they are. With getting information from American movies and stories\
  \ that we used to hear I expected to be in a country with tough people or even aggressive.\
  \ But it was totally the opposite, Starting with guiding me to a place which gave\
  \ me a new wheelchair for free to use it among Russia for a whole month \u2013I\
  \ have just stayed 10 Days there- passing with Opening every closed door in any\
  \ museum or historical place just because I am on a wheelchair , then passing again\
  \ with two women -who did not know each other before- & do not speak English at\
  \ all but helped me to find out where to go by the underground by making a searching\
  \ committee if I can say by using Google translator and Google maps , And ending\
  \ with a wonderful taxi driver, who gave me a free tour in Moscow because of the\
  \ same reason which is using the wheelchair  Although he knew that I am just injured\
  \ & not paralyzed .\nActually I did not expect that the Iced Russia will have that\
  \ warmness not in weather but in dealing with me from a human prospective without\
  \ asking me about my nationality or my religion. \nAnd this journey was a journey\
  \ to remember because it was \"Regardless the Obstacle\""
