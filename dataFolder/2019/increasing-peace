Text: "In Australia I was quoted $4000 AUD for the removal of my wisdom teeth. Finding\
  \ these approximated dental costs overly expensive for my student budget in 2013,\
  \ I searched for an alternative solution. Thailand offered the best solution for\
  \ my dental issues, and so I set about obtaining my first Passport and a tourist\
  \ visa from the Thailand Embassy in Melbourne. No stranger to travel, but I had\
  \ yet to fly out of Australia and experience a different country. I packed two small\
  \ bags and travelled alone. Near the end of the flight, the plane travelled through\
  \ the scariest black clouds. All was pitch black, the plane shook violently from\
  \ the storm that we passed through and gripping the seat arms was all I could do\
  \ until we passed the worst of it. Upon the night arrival in Suvarnabhumi, one of\
  \ the first things I noticed about the difference in our cultures was a seated lady\
  \ on the floor of the airport. She sat entirely contained and calm in a lotus position,\
  \ giving the first strongly memorable impression of Thailand. Then I took the airport\
  \ train directly from the airport to Phaya Thai station, then connecting services\
  \ to Siam, then Saphan Taksin. The Chao Praya river flows beside Saphan Taksin,\
  \ and trapped river water around the structures causes an overpowering stench. The\
  \ swelter of the tropical city hit as soon as I left the air-conditioned train,\
  \ even at 11pm. Food and drinks were offered at the many roadside carts, some bursting\
  \ with brightly coloured exotic appearance. As I walked to my backpacker accommodation\
  \ in Bangrak, I dropped my preconceptions of the streets being dangerous. Although\
  \ this thought did not bother me, and I walked amongst the locals, and street dogs,\
  \ taking the time to experience all of the sights that were already before my eyes.\
  \ \n\nA few days passed, and I was picked up by the driver for the dentist, he was\
  \ very courteous and I felt at ease and that I could trust the dentist with my surgery.\
  \ I paid cash in baht (14,500) after my surgery which covered all associated costs.\
  \ Immediately after my surgery was over, I was driven to Siam upon my request, and\
  \ I had a lovely asparagus soup contained within a large round bread roll (rather\
  \ similar to a medieval trencher) for lunch from a western style eatery. The softest\
  \ food that could be found. Back in Bangrak I traversed the local shops and bought\
  \ silk garments and a necklace from one of the many jewellery merchants. With my\
  \ swollen face I wandered Bangkok and discovered a Snake Farm. Cobras were only\
  \ metres from the seated audience, without containment, only the snake handlers\
  \ to keep them in check. The chance to hold a large yellow python was not to be\
  \ missed and my body was squeezed lovingly. Having no fear of pythons, I enjoyed\
  \ the photo opportunity. After a week my teeth were checked with another driver\
  \ pick-up and I was cleared to go from Bangkok. Hua Lamphong with the seated rows\
  \ specifically for Buddhist monks and ordinary seats was the start of my passage\
  \ by land to the south of Thailand. An overnight train journey to Surat Thani cost\
  \ about $16 AUD in 2013, and I had the upper bunk with a pillow and blanket. I had\
  \ a vegetarian Thai style meal that was delivered on a tray, as the unknown places\
  \ outside slipped past. The train stopped at the time noted on my ticket and I got\
  \ out at a tiny train platform with my 2 small bags. It did not seem right, and\
  \ after asking a Thai boy who did not speak English, then another man who did, I\
  \ was directed to get back onto the train. I did, just in time!"
