Text: "\u2018The chefs call me \u2018Brigitte Bardot\u2019, because she is an animal\
  \ rights activist,\u2019 the waitress tells me. We are walking to the beach, from\
  \ my accommodation and her workplace, l\u2019H\xF4tel de la Plage, in the quiet\
  \ before the evening rush. We cross a short stretch of tidy hydrangea beds and the\
  \ odd plane tree, a Norman nod to southern French boulevards. \nWalls of wild roses\
  \ hide modern seaside houses and the more-than-slight breeze carries a soapy floral\
  \ scent towards us. Ahead, the Channel forms a bridge between the two walls that\
  \ circle the town of Quin\xE9ville, built to protect hardy customers at Bar la Br\xE8\
  che from the worst of the Cotentin Peninsula winds. The murky water is barely distinguishable\
  \ from the overcast sky. Well-fed gulls circle, flying in formation, their cries\
  \ like sirens on the wind. \n\u2018I hate that. Bardot is very right wing, you know.\u2019\
  \nThe waitress carries a covered plastic crate for moules; collected locally on\
  \ the bay of Barfleur. She lifts the lid, inside it crawls with crabs. Some are\
  \ tiny and orange; perfectly detailed by nature. Others are big and black, like\
  \ leggy smudges with a pinch. They scatter like shrapnel, in a panicked search for\
  \ shelter.\n\u2018They come with the moules,\u2019 she shrugs. \u2018I hate that\
  \ they die in the kitchen.\u2019 \nOn our right, we pass the Quin\xE9ville Memorial\
  \ World War II Museum. A long row of flags flutter: United States, France, United\
  \ Kingdom, Spain and Canada. The white and black winged bird, a symbol found across\
  \ this coastline, flies alongside them. \nI stop to look at the plinth outside the\
  \ museum. It is white, blue and red and depicts a burning flame. Voie de la Libert\xE9\
  , 1944 \u2013 it marks the freedom path. \n\u2018A lot of allies died here,\u2019\
  \ the waitress tells me. Her angular body braces against the wind. \nWe reach the\
  \ fine, grey sand of Quin\xE9ville Plage. I consider removing my shoes, but there\
  \ is a chill in the air. The tide is midway and in the gloomy light of a stormy\
  \ sky, there are only a few game paddlers. Two little boys in bright yellow windbreakers\
  \ squeal at the water\u2019s edge. A family collects shellfish in nets. \n\u2018\
  Bulots (whelks), mainly,\u2019 she watches them. \u2018We serve them as a starter.\
  \ It is hard to see when the customer is finished. The plate is always full of shells!\u2019\
  \nWe crest a small hill of beach debris, including some barren bulot husks. They\
  \ stand tall, like a dollop of cr\xE8me fraiche, another Norman delicacy. Here and\
  \ there, gulls pick through it with their beaks.\n\u2018My boss taught me to look\
  \ at the mayonnaise pot on the side: when that\u2019s empty, the customer has eaten\
  \ all the little bulot bodies.\u2019 She continues, with a small smile, \u2018when\
  \ it is two-thirds empty, call for the main.\u2019 \n\u2018Are you a vegetarian?\u2019\
  \ I ask her. In the sand, harder now, small holes appear as we step; creatures burrow\
  \ beneath us, seeking safety. \n\u2018Yes,\u2019 she responds, \u2018but I sometimes\
  \ eat chicken.\u2019 \n I nod at the channel, now an iron bar ahead of us, reflecting\
  \ the weight of a passing rain cloud. \u2018Is it cold?\u2019\nShe shrugs, \u2018\
  it is not pleasant if you don\u2019t want to be in it.\u2019 \nShe stops. \u2018\
  We won\u2019t get there in time. We can leave them here.\u2019\n\u2018I can take\
  \ them,\u2019 I offer. My eyes sting in the salty air.\n\u2018I need the crate or\
  \ the chefs will tease me. Here is fine.\u2019\nShe plonks it down near a patch\
  \ of kelp and unceremoniously tips the crabs out. Some scuttle away, heading directly\
  \ underground for a crustaceous reunion, the rest lie dazed.\nThe gulls return as\
  \ we walk back across the sand. Over my shoulder, bewildered crabs twitch, their\
  \ orange bodies made more visible by their bed of dark purple weeds. A gull swoops.\
  \ Crabs scatter sideways. A second gull spirals downwards; all precision and aim.\
  \ The damp air is a chorus of victorious squealing. A delicious feast. A massacre.\
  \ \n\u2018It is the life cycle,\u2019 the waitress shrugs. \u2018This beach has\
  \ seen worse.\u2019\nThrough the gap in the walls, I spot the plinth. It gleams\
  \ against the darkening sky."
