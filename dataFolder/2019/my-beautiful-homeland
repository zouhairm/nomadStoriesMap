Text: "It all started back a year and a half ago while I was getting myself all amped\
  \ up for the trip of a life time. Where is it you ask I\u2019m going? Egypt the\
  \ motherland my beautiful homeland. I wasn\u2019t born in Egypt like my parents\
  \ were but that doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t my homeland. It\u2019s where\
  \ my roots date back decades and I will forever be proud of it. The month finally\
  \ came and i began to jump for joy only two weeks and I\u2019ll be going home as\
  \ call it. I went crazy shopping for all the right things to bring with me on my\
  \ trip cloths, shoes, swimsuits and more. Finally a few days till my trip and I\u2019\
  ve begun packing. Now keep in mind it\u2019s only for three weeks so I can\u2019\
  t over pack but I probably will anyways. One day before I leave is my birthday I\
  \ get myself pampered hair done nails done so I can sleep and wake up ready to head\
  \ to the airport. This is it the day is here where I can finally jump on that plane\
  \ and head out to my beautiful homeland. After a nine and half hour flight we finally\
  \ land, super early morning over there and Egypt. I look around me and smell the\
  \ fresh air of what\u2019s been missing for many years. I\u2019m greeted by family\
  \ and friends hugs and kisses because it\u2019s accustom for us to do so. Fast forward\
  \ about one day I\u2019ve woken up super early with my sister to the gorgeous view\
  \ of the spectacular pyramids. My sister and i to pack a small bag as we travelled\
  \ to another city with my aunt and uncle till my parents follow after. The drive\
  \ was gorgeous we decided to travel through the city to see the beautiful breathtaking\
  \ crystal clear blue ocean. It was just like I was looking in a magazine but living\
  \ it in the real world. Each city you come to eat restaurant you stop at, has a\
  \ story of it own. You must live and breathe it to know that you\u2019re in Egypt.\
  \ I took many trips to different cities spent countless nights having so much fun\
  \ you don\u2019t even know where you are. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m in\
  \ Egypt because of its beauty. Going to the historic churches and mosques let you\
  \ know how it all started. How two different religions became one with each other\
  \ because no one discriminates against the other. Taking a trip to Khan al Khalili\
  \ is just as if you\u2019re in Turkey visiting the Grand bazaar. So many things\
  \ to see so many foods to eat. If you want a pretty decent nightlife I\u2019d visit\
  \ on occasion but nothing tops a great nightlife like the city of Cairo. Taking\
  \ a gorgeous ride along the Nile river watcing as the night peeks in. This is the\
  \ only time of day where life begins. Finally after countless trips and endless\
  \ fun my trip came to an end. With sorrow and sadness that strikes my face it was\
  \ just about time to go home. Repacking all my bags and taking a piece of egypt\
  \ with me to make sure it\u2019s never forgotten. Oh wait you\u2019re my beautiful\
  \ homeland that won\u2019t ever be forgotten."
