Text: The warm rays of the sun touched my face as a shivered up the mountaneous area
  in the city of Budapest. The day was about to come to an end and we were attracted
  by this huge cross facing towards the bridge and the water. My soul gasped at the
  presence of such a beautiful site, being a believer it was a God given discovery
  I would not miss at all. Up we went, step after another pausing to observe the breath-taking
  views, they got better the higher we went. I gazed at the tiny rusty gate right
  at the top, I could already see the sun rays shooting through the tiny rocks at
  the top excentuating a bold lady statue. Finally stepping into the platform I held
  my breath for a while. The sunset, people, everything felt as beholding the glory
  of God. The whole of Budapest was a heaven to behold, the noises of cars and the
  city life disappeared for a while. We walked past " I do's" expressed on padlocks
  with names. Right up to the quiet market at close with a food truck still open.
  Budapest won my heart that even she became a cherished memory, a glorious treasure.
  A hidden beauty clearly visible from that top.
