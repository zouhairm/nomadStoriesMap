Text: "The immediate reaction people had when they heard that my family and I were\
  \ visiting the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in January was sympathy. This was surprising\
  \ given that the Kgalagadi is well known for its exceptional wildlife and well-provided\
  \ facilities. It became clear later that this reaction was not relating to the destination\
  \ but rather the weather at that time of year. January was going to be hot, very\
  \ hot.  \n\nOur first stop was Mata-Mata Rest Camp, which is located in the South\
  \ Western region of the park on the Namibian border. The rest camp provided a campsite\
  \ and self-catering chalets for accommodation, my family chose the latter for our\
  \ stay. Each chalet had a balcony overlooked the park primed for spontaneous animal\
  \ viewings. Our chalet was first in line and closest to the watering hole giving\
  \ prime viewing right from the balcony. \n\nEach day we would pack the car with\
  \ supplies and venture out to explore the area. High summer temperatures meant the\
  \ best time to see animals at their most active was early in the morning or late\
  \ evening. This meant our morning game drives would start at 5am and we would be\
  \ out for three to five hours at a time. The mornings were the best viewing times,\
  \ but we made sure that we went out twice a day to maximise our chances of seeing\
  \ game. \n\nBeing out in the park for so long meant we saw a diversity of animals,\
  \ catching their nuances in behaviour, which would otherwise be missed. The area\
  \ near Mata-Mata was flush with giraffes that blending into the trees, herds of\
  \ wildebeest, lone jackals and many ground squirrels. The area was also home to\
  \ a family of cheetahs \u2013 mom and two cubs. We spend a long time with this family\
  \ of three. We watched and listened as their chirps filled the dry and dusty air,\
  \ causing confusion to anyone who hasn\u2019t heard their bird-like cries. \n\n\
  Our time with these three cats meant that we got to witness their interactions,\
  \ not only with each other but with other animals nearby. Shade and water bring\
  \ all sorts of animals together. The three cheetahs were surrounded by four jackals.\
  \ Jackals are scavengers by nature and are expected that they choose to stick close\
  \ and follow other predators in hopes of feeding off their leftovers. \n\nAs the\
  \ sun crept higher into the sky, we stayed to watch the cheetahs move to a larger\
  \ tree to escape the heat. The jackals, normally know to keep their distance, used\
  \ this motion as an opportunity to move closer to the three cats. A jackal, seeing\
  \ an opportunity to pounce on one of the cubs, snuck up and lashed out to bite the\
  \ cub\u2019s tail. We didn\u2019t expect to find a jackal this brave.\n\nThe action\
  \ was so out of the ordinary it took us all a moment to register what was happening.\
  \ The jackal was playing with the cheetah cub. In a strange way, it looked to be\
  \ an African Safari retelling of Romeo and Juliet. The cheetah cub and jackal pup\
  \ from two very different worlds choosing to approach each other despite this. It\
  \ provided some quality morning entertainment. \n\nKgalagadi provided so many more\
  \ curious moments like the cub and the jackal. We witnessed a Springbok giving birth.\
  \ A pride of lions 3 meters from a viewing hide. A baby wildebeest separated from\
  \ the herd. A jackal catching a pale chanting goshawk. And so many bateleurs our\
  \ response became: \u201COh no! Not another bateleur?\u201D After two weeks in the\
  \ park, it became clear that sympathy was not the right response to visiting in\
  \ January. Yes, it was hot. Despite this fact, the park provided so many moments\
  \ to remind us of the duality nature \u2013 both beautiful and cruel."
