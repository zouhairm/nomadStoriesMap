Text: "Hajime!\nMy left fist struck my opponent before my mind registered the command.\
  \ Due to my height advantage, the first blow caught him off guard as I let loose\
  \ a fierce kiai, but by my second he was striking back. I felt impact all over:\
  \ his punch on my wrist, my kick to his forearm, his fists tapping the air out my\
  \ gut. Our fight was so dirty that nobody scored. So much for beginner\u2019s luck.\n\
  My first taste of competition Karate with Team Northumbria was bittersweet. After\
  \ confirming my loss, I clambered back to my seat and collapsed with exhaustion;\
  \ more empowered than ever.  My athlete\u2019s high ensued. The fierce exercise\
  \ and competition triggered a burst of endorphins, reminding me of the thousand\
  \ times I felt this after a basketball game or track meet. My past self touched\
  \ fingers with my future self, in the present. The space between then and now shrank\
  \ down to a single point. I sat there in the stands, dumbstruck that this connection\
  \ existed.\nAt BUCS Invitational I fought more than I spoke. Life granted me a conversation\
  \ with two nine-year olds boasting their record for head kicks in a single match,\
  \ and a moment of eaves dropping on parents gossiping about other people\u2019s\
  \ kids. Nostalgia ensued again as I remembered my basketball games similarly.\n\
  I was claustrophobic as the first day concluded.  Dinner, sleep, and another day\
  \ of competition still lay between me and my return to Newcastle. We ate at Nando\u2019\
  s where I nursed a bottle of Desperados and relished in my confusing, melancholy\
  \ mood and thought of home. But which one? For some reason the image in my mind\
  \ flipped between the wide cobblestone streets of Newcastle and its Victorian Architecture,\
  \ and Atlanta and its modern skyscrapers and smell of hot cement in the South.\n\
  The word \u2018home\u2019 became ambiguous when I started college, but exploring\
  \ Newcastle and Sheffield made the term otherworldly. Newcastle holds a special\
  \ place in my heart as my first international journey and home for ten months. Twelve\
  \ hours in Sheffield left me yearning for this city as much as my hometown. I was\
  \ trapped in a strange space between two homes and two lives I\u2019ve made, and\
  \ this space was full of growth and nostalgia to chase. That night I found a comfortable\
  \ sleep I thought wouldn\u2019t come.\nAnother day, another kumite. Team Northumbria\u2019\
  s only novices, Daniel and I, took a walk after we finished fighting to clear our\
  \ heads. We vented about our shortcomings as we slinked aimlessly around the block,\
  \ beholding Sheffield\u2019s steampunk architecture. Then, we beelined to a building\
  \ with huge glass windows.\nGorgeous trees and other vegetation greeted us upon\
  \ entry to The Millennium Gallery. I found my inspiration as I decided to leave.\
  \ On our way to the exit, a fixture of large, blue and white glass speech bubbles\
  \ drew our attention. The text read that we\u2019re \u201Cmillions of molecules\
  \ that are always happening and growing and changing,\u201D and that we\u2019re\
  \ the \u201Cart of matter.\u201D Most notably, these speech bubbles called me a\
  \ \u201Cliving, walking poem.\u201D Instantly I remembered who I am and what my\
  \ muses are. I\u2019m an artist first and fighter second, which means I should\u2019\
  ve looked to BUCS Invitational for inspiration and experiences, not titles and accolades.\n\
  The medals ceremony followed the finals later. Competitors from each event strode\
  \ before the crowd and was awarded a shiny medallion. Just like in their fights,\
  \ these artists told me plenty without ever speaking. Pangs of longing and inadequacy\
  \ simmered in me as I watched my peers bask in the limelight I failed to reach.\
  \ Rather than deny those pangs, I accepted them, and they existed alongside my respect\
  \ and admiration for my competitors just fine. Feeling sorry for myself was a waste\
  \ of energy I could focus on being happy for them. This life lesson was a ghost\
  \ from the past that\u2019s lingered around me since age thirteen, but I couldn\u2019\
  t grasp it until I was twenty, exploring the U.K. Somehow, a weekend submerged in\
  \ the unknown connected me to the familiarity of the past through nostalgic daydreams\
  \ and musings of home spread across continents and timelines."
