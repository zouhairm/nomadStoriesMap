Text: "Over the course of the week of my university\u2019s designated \"Reading\"\
  week, my sister, one of my closest friends and I made our way to St Lucia. This\
  \ whole trip turned out to be a dream come true filled with life lessons and astonishing\
  \ discoveries. The sequence of events crumbled to make the trip go so seamlessly\
  \ essentially making me realize conceptually the idea of such thing as \"too good\
  \ to be true\" is jaded and a false illusion. I had dreamt about going to St Lucia\
  \ since before  entering university and finally got a chance to travel through my\
  \ sister as she is a flight attendant. Desperately wanting to get away from these\
  \ cold walls and dreadful somber winter days, we packed our bags and made our way\
  \ to Montreal not being a hundred percent sure we would make it on the flight, as\
  \ Air Canada employees are put on standby. Upon our arrival in Montreal, my friend\
  \ and I took the metro and made our way to the airport. At our arrival, we found\
  \ out that my sister\u2019s flight from Vancouver had been delayed due to snow and\
  \ we were not sure we were going to make it on the flight. We had lost hope, therefore\
  \ latched onto despair and sorrow. Shortly after, the manager of the check-in kiosks\
  \ asked us if we needed assistance, having explained to her our situation she spoke\
  \ to the pilots and managed to pull some strings so my sister would make it to the\
  \ gate regardless of her plane being late. A couple of hours later we finally made\
  \ it to St Lucia and were greeted by the warm sun and beautiful and utterly kind\
  \ souls. We became beach bums and charmed an amazing man by the name of Jermaine\
  \ to take us snorkeling out in front of the famous Soufriere Pitons and that is\
  \ when my life changed. Throughout my eighteen years of living, I have taken countless\
  \ swimming lessons however never mastered maneuvering deep water. Snorkeling usually\
  \ requires fairly deep water and knowing that we had access to lifejackets I underestimated\
  \ the steepness of the water. As soon as I jumped in the water my body was rushed\
  \ with millions of ions that contained cells of panic. However, one thing I realized\
  \ was that I needed to internalize that it was simply not that deep and that the\
  \ universe sent me on this trip and it was not to fucking die. So I calmed myself\
  \ down and said \"fuck winter, just relax and enjoy the vibe\". So I did just that.\
  \ I put my head down and yelled under the water \"Fuck Winter\" as loud as I could\
  \ and admired the fishes and dragged myself back to the boat. This experience taught\
  \ me that I can do anything I put my mind to as long as I believe myself. Reminding\
  \ myself why the lady helped us get into the plane and how sweet Jermaine was to\
  \ take us out on his boat for free reminded me that the world can often be not that\
  \ bad and that just like the deep water, nothing is out to get me. In the end, just\
  \ like winter and most of life, something in the universe is like a miserable artist\
  \ desperately trying to prove me that they have something to show for and that fear\
  \ which is False Evidence Appearing Real needs to scarce from the fragile mind."
