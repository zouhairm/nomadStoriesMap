Text: "Usually, Panama and the CIty of Panama is a tiny country in themiddle of Central\
  \ America  which its role is to be as tunnel or a passage to all citizens who are\
  \ traveling around the globe and/or passing by the America\xB4s continent. It\xB4\
  s overthere planes of all over the airline companies with your AirBuses and Boeings\
  \ or even with the private Jets make the stop down on the tiny and almost hidden\
  \ \"island\". \nAccording to this, my case was not an exception. After a 25 day-trip\
  \ of US, my plane, flying Copa Airlines, a Latin American airline, had flew from\
  \ Miami to Rio de janeirop (Brazil), passing by Panama. It was only one stop on\
  \ this leg and  it was ok. According to the fly ticket, my stop in Panama will be\
  \ for 14 hours and lifting up to Brazsil on that same day. \nDue to this, I arrived\
  \ in Panama at 8 am and it was kinda nostalgic. I finally was on a Espa\xF1ol language\
  \ land for full, 100%.  On the contrary of US, where everyplace I have been i barely\
  \ had a delay of few seconds just to sense which language would  I use to communicate\
  \ with other people. \nDespite, the American Dollar was  its currency money, people\
  \ overthere, or pa\xF1amenos, says a lot in Spanish. Thank God!\nOn the way out\
  \ of the Airport a elder gentleman took me and my older sister in his car and he\
  \ was so gentile, so charming, it looked like as my past away grandfather. So thoughtful...\
  \ and his thoughtfulness spread us and took us for the main places in City of Panama,\
  \ the capital city of Panama: The Panama`s Canal, where ships and boats from all\
  \ over the world take this passage which is a shortcut to continueing travelling\
  \ at the sea. Generally, the whole passage it\xB4s pricey and diminish 2 or 3 monts\
  \ of trips on the ocean. And it was fantastic to see huge ships going up and down\
  \ in a few minutes betewwen the gates. \nAfter this, we made a city tour walking\
  \ by the Historic center and We\xB4ve could seen the city hall, the antique buildings,\
  \ where Indians people lived centuries ago and we saw a huge President\xB4s House\
  \ and  lots of   shops, diners and bars. Meanwhile, this historic center is almost\
  \ near of the oceanfront, where the beach is home for lovely yachts and small boats\
  \ for wealthy people. In fact, it seems Panama has a lot of wealthy people, because\
  \ i saw a lot of yachts overthere. From all parts in the world. \nBack to the historical\
  \ center, we could had lunch in a beautiful speaclist restaurant sea food and then\
  \ walk by some public fairs where many artistas and designers sell its masterpieces\
  \ in a good price. \nBut the main character of Panama is the people. Everybody is\
  \ thoughtful, everybody treats you very kindly and it seems you have been friends\
  \ for years. I know Brazilians have this fame across the globe but I thought Paname\xF1\
  os were most. They are cr\xE8me de la cr\xE8me in the way of how being polite and\
  \ nice people.  It\xB4s incredible. \nI only know after 14 hours passed and no time\
  \ remaining more, in the Airport, my flight was calling me to go back to Brazil,\
  \ I sat and cried, cried, cried a river as i would be in a divorce of i felt like\
  \ a child left on the school\xB4s door for the first day and firt time during the\
  \ schoolarship. Finally, after this, i put Panama in my plans to return and see\
  \ and feel more slowly the people and the city. Panama is one place on Earth that\
  \ I could live some part of life."
