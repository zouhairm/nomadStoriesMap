Text: "have you ever been to a place that you have never been to and keep on dreaming\
  \ on going there? When I saw this opportunity, I was thrill to be the first one\
  \ to apply. This is one of the place in my bucket list. If I get select, I will\
  \ go tp Pico do Arieiro for breakfast. Then head to  belem tower, then will go to\
  \ park and nation palace of Rena. In addition will go to get lunch then head to\
  \ Bairro Alto and stay there at night at the bar to experience the nightlife at\
  \ Potugal.I heard the nightlife is the best way to know the local people there.\
  \  The second day will head to Bairro Alto to look at the castle with seaviews.\
  \ then head to Quinta da Regaleira to visit gardens. Furthermore lunch will head\
  \ to Bolsa Palace, after that will head to Peneda-Ger\xEAs National Park for a walk\
  \ then eat dinner. The third day, will go to National Azulejo Museum, then heading\
  \ to Park and Palace of Monserrate, then Tavira Island to see the views, and lay\
  \ back and relax. I am a person that loves oceans and see the nature, this is the\
  \ perfect trip for me. The fourth day will go to Ocean\xE1rio de Lisboa, it is an\
  \ aquarium and see the ocean. I love seining aquariums, and then ater that head\
  \ to Santa Justa Lift and this is to help get around the neighborhood, I think this\
  \ is pretty cool. The head to lunch, then head to Livraria Lello, this is a bookshop,\
  \ it has nice artichtiecture. Ay last if I have more time, I will see other attractions,\
  \ but I already have a listo on my mind. This is a great chance for me to express\
  \ my ideas of where I want to go and do. I really can't wait and getting excited\
  \ already."
