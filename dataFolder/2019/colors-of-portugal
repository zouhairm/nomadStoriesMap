Text: "The first time I arrived in Portugal I decided: this is the place where I want\
  \ to live. So it happened! Lisbon is now my city and I couldn\u2019t be happier\
  \ of my choice, but why portugal?\nAfter three years living in baltic countries\
  \ i needed a different prospective of life.\nI made my first trip and I was overwhelmed\
  \ with amazing food and wines, great hospitality and a lovely decadent charm that\
  \ is really the heart and soul of this beautiful country. \nIt is absolutely a delightful\
  \ experience walking in the alleys of Lisbon and Porto, while a lovely smell of\
  \ fish or grilled sardines guides you throughout those amazing streets, so full\
  \ of history and stories. But Portugal is not only Lisbon and Porto, in order for\
  \ you to know the real essence of Portugal you need to take a trip to Piodao.\n\
  The trip to Piodao was one of my favorite experiences of my life, I left the amazing\
  \ Coimbra (yes you should definitely visit Coimbra and its university) to drive\
  \ to a timeless journey going through lands where the time stopped. You will have\
  \ the chance to see people producing their cheeses or oil, two important products\
  \ of the Portuguese tradition. When you will arrive to Piodao, you just won\u2019\
  t believe how old and isolated is this place!\nNevertheless the countryside of Portugal\
  \ offers also breathtaking views on the Douro valley, driving your car through the\
  \ narrow streets in the woods is a lifetime experience. Enjoying the wines of the\
  \ area is a pleasure that everyone should try.\nBut Portugal is loved by a lot of\
  \ people especially for its coast. After two years here I see I still need to see\
  \ a lot but the Costa Vicentina and Algarve are two places that captured my heart.\
  \ I loved to feel a small part of nature, enjoying the dramatic rocks of the see\
  \ or seeing the magic colors of a sunset. But Portugal is not only on the continent!\
  \ Sadly I haven\u2019t seen Azores yet, but Madeira...I don\u2019t even know where\
  \ to start with Madeira, however I can certainly say that for me is the most amazing\
  \ place in the world. Impressive mountains, exotic birds and gardens, amazing beaches,\
  \ beautiful nature, old traditions, charming towns and delicious food. Yes Madeira\
  \ offers everything it is just there for you, and you should really visit it"
