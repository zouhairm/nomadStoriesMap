Text: "As I wonder beyond the border that separates my family\u2019s homeland - on\
  \ maps, if not physically - I proceed toward the glorious landscapes, the people,\
  \ the culture, the animus of a nation with a legacy, I think about neighbors. Portugal\
  \ is Spain\u2019s neighbor. Simple and corny and kind of a \u201Cno brainer\u201D\
  \ here. But it\u2019s not as simple as that.\nYou see this is a whole entire country\
  \ that is someone\u2019s neighbor. And Europe is a great big neighborhood. And in\
  \ that neighborhood lies Portugal, one of the oldest countries to exist on the continent.\
  \ Only Auntie Andorra, Cousin Switzerland and good Ole San Marino can say the same.\
  \ And yet, they all lack a coastline. Portugal has a beautiful coastline open towards\
  \ the North Atlantic which to this day forms the backbone of the Iberian nation.\n\
  Food and wine aplenty along with the friendliest of people and the cleanest of beaches,\
  \ Portugal continues to offer the best of what it has been good at it\u2019s entire\
  \ existence.\nFrom Faro to Lisboa to Porto, there is something for everyone\u2019\
  s palette. Port wine and the francesinha are just the beginning of what you can\
  \ experience in the former Lusitania. The entire country offers the best in seafood,\
  \ In particular bacalao. And the beer is of great quality, taste, and it\u2019s\
  \ very affordable for everyone on all type of budget.\nPortugal is one of Europe\u2019\
  s most beautiful and magnificent treasures, and I can say that I\u2019m proud to\
  \ have it as a neighbor, as it offers so much adventure and life. I wish to share\
  \ this wonderful little country with the world. A country that has been overshadowed\
  \ by its larger European neighbors with wonderful iconic monuments. A country that\
  \ has superbly iconic monuments of its own. A country that is rich in history and\
  \ culture. A country that enjoys life and looks towards the future."
