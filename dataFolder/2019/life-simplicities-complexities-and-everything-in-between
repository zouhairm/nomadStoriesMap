Text: "So how can everything in life be so simple and co-ordinated. We wake up, we\
  \ eat, we go to work, we get home, we eat and then we sleep. Life in its simplistic\
  \ form is in effect a repetitive routine. We live and go through life living by\
  \ rules and regulations set by by our predecessors.\nWe need to step out of this\
  \ comfort zone or in my personal situation \u2018stepping away from shackles and\
  \ restraints\u2019. Life can be so zapping if you follow the path that everyone\
  \ else wants you to follow; but once you start thinking for yourself and outside\
  \ the norm the world becomes your oyster. Having already spent time away in America,\
  \ Guatemala and Italy I\u2019ve already experienced how culture can adapt and effect\
  \ your mind. It\u2019s an amazing feeling to be completely free with no limitations.\n\
  How much are we capable of if we really let ourselves go and completely embrace\
  \ the new, weird and different.\nSo where does this idea of French Polynesia come\
  \ from? To be honest; from a dream, a real vivid dream that felt as real as that\
  \ first time you ride a bike without stabilisers. The dream left me with a real\
  \ thirst for adventure and so many questions. Blue waters, white sands and the poetic\
  \ French language. Deep in my subconscious the French language is there among Italian\
  \ and Spanish and I know my brain is ready to develop a deeper understanding of\
  \ what this life has for us and what we can experience. Languages; just one of the\
  \ many complexities in our life.\nThere are so many more complexities and simplicities\
  \ that I wish to divulge once in surroundings that can influence the way I write\
  \ and feel.\nFor now; I will leave you with what I feel is my idiosyncrasy. Painting\
  \ weird pictures in my mind which lead to stories and these stories come to light\
  \ in a potryal via a strange accent. In actual fact this strange accent has become\
  \ my go to for any accents and any portrayal of friends or people I meet in Day\
  \ to Day to life. But the perfect example of these weird pictures leading to stories\
  \ in my mind goes hand in hand with my current work life. Sitting in an office;\
  \ three seats and the middle one being occupied by a young lady called Rose. So\
  \ in my head this lead to a story which I wrote down called; \u2018A rose between\
  \ two fauns\u2019. Now stay with me, as you\u2019re getting a small snippet into\
  \ my mind....so the premise of this story is that in 2020 two creatures come out\
  \ into the modern world after hundreds of years of hiding. They become accepted\
  \ as part of the modern world and get hired by a company that are looking to buck\
  \ the trend of only having humans on staff. The first day they are sat either side\
  \ of a young lady called Rose and the story begins. It\u2019s simple yet complicated\
  \ and ties in nicely with how I feel about life and everything in between.\n\nThank\
  \ you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you."
