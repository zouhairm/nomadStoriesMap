Text: "\"It's about setting an intention.\" I remember Yasheera's words from a few\
  \ days earlier. They echo in me as my hand reaches to touch my throat and I wince.\
  \ Each breath pierces my esophagus. Like swallowing ice picks, the tips getting\
  \ caught as they fight their way down, rewarded only by a quick pause in my chest\
  \ before they are catapulted back up into my throat. I am standing on a small stone\
  \ landing, in the shadows between lanterns and between an aching decision to press\
  \ on or retreat to the comfort of lower ground. I am about halfway up the 5,500\
  \ stair\_climb to Adam's Peak, the 5th\_highest mountain in Sri Lanka. It's almost\
  \ 4:00am and my shirt dampened with sweat is cooled by the mountain night air and\
  \ brings momentary comfort.\n\nYasheera lives in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka\
  \ on the eastern coast of the island. A friend of my partner's, he met with us in\
  \ the nearby town of Mt. Lavinia for a warm evening of wine and comradery, wrapped\
  \ in the ever-so-slightly thinning humidity rolling in from the soft waves on the\
  \ shore. He tells us he climbs the mountain twice a year. As we spoke about the\
  \ climb to the top he explained: if you don't have an intention you're not going\
  \ to get up there. You're trying to deliver this thing and at the top is where you\
  \ leave it.\_\n\nThe intention is both your guide and your fuel; to do this climb\
  \ without one only gets you halfway.\_\n\nAdam's Peak is a site of many pilgrimages\
  \ year-round and an important cultural, community and spiritual climb for people\
  \ of many faiths. Near the center of the island in hill country, it acts as a beacon\
  \ to the nearby town of Hatton.\_The climb begins with stretches of flat ground,\
  \ a path sprinkled with tea shops. All too soon this gives way to stair after stair,\
  \ only getting steeper as you go.\_\n\nMy breath is coming now, even and smooth.\
  \ I look up and see my partner motioning for me to hurry up, anxious to see the\
  \ sunrise from the top as 6:00am looms closer. I'm anxious to keep my legs and lungs\
  \ from exploding, with the sunrise coming in at a close second. \n\nThrough the\
  \ faint lamplight, I'm watching people who pass me and search their limbs for the\
  \ secret of endurance. An older woman, likely in her 80\u2019s, is holding the handrail\
  \ to the right side of the uneven steps. Her left leg does not bend. She swings\
  \ this leg along with a cane to the stair above. Steadied, she wills her body to\
  \ follow suit. And then the next stair. And next. Rhythmic. I see children, some\
  \ clambering and some sleeping on the backs of the parents who carry them up, up,\
  \ up. Three teenage brothers carry their 4th who's lost mobility from the waist\
  \ down. Women singing, monks singing, carrying a call and response refrain. Encouragement:\
  \ turning burden to light.\_\_\n\nI continue climbing and breathe. I hold my intention\
  \ close to my chest like a tensor bandage convincing my ribcage to hold fast. Exhale.\
  \ I'm finding a rhythm.\_\n\nThe last leg is the steepest. The distance between\
  \ climbers is closing as we near the top. The temple at the peak is at capacity.\
  \ We stop, standing 3 to a step, 40 feet from the entrance gates. Perfect, as it\
  \ turns out. A completely unobstructed view as the sky begins to lighten and a thin\
  \ stream of sun streaks across the horizon. Over smaller mountains, hills turning\
  \ from misted dark greys to deep and bright forests of colour. On the step below\
  \ I watch as a young Buddhist monk, dressed only in a thin orange robe, works 2\
  \ cell phones, one in each hand to capture the immensity pouring out of the sky\
  \ towards us.\_\n\nWe reach the temple an hour after the sun has risen. It\u2019\
  s 7:00am and the sky and day are full and open. People sit sharing food and stories\
  \ and I feel full. I leave my intention at the top, grateful it carried me this\
  \ far and knowing that again, it will help bring me home."
