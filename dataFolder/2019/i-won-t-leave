Text: "I wasn\xB4t feeling good. I missed my family, I missed my bedroom, I missed\
  \ the coffee I used to drink in my favorite corner. It was my sixth month in M\xE1\
  laga. I had just turned 20 and spent my birthday eating frozen yogurt. Ten thousand\
  \ miles away from home. I felt guilty: I was supposed to be happy, I was in one\
  \ of the happiest places in earth - sunshine, beaches, no winter - . I felt like\
  \ breaking down so I walked, and walked, and walked. And I went where the sun could\
  \ reach me, where everything was tourists, and languages, and random conversations.\
  \  People walking dogs and dogs walking people. Where I could only be one, among\
  \ millions, who writes, who feels, who loves. Where no one knew my name or even\
  \ had interest in knowing it. Where my presence became part of the landscape and\
  \ my face a blurry background in someone's memory. The girl who just stares.  I\
  \ went there because I\xB4d rather be alone in a crowd than lonely by myself. Yes,\
  \ I was lost, but lost in couples\xB4ilussions, in pictures a tourist took, in seagull\xB4\
  s flights, in memories that won\xB4t be remembered. The dock, surprisingly, turned\
  \ into something special. My safest place. My home away from home."
