Text: "\u2018Arrived\u2019 \u2013 my husband\u2019s voice comes from another universe.\
  \ I exit the car to dizzy rain that wakes me up and stand in front of two-story\
  \ stone manor. Massive house looks at me with completely dark windows. I go around\
  \ helplessly trying to knock. Wet sweatshirt sticks to my skin as despair takes\
  \ over my mind \u2013 by now we\u2019ve made about fifty miles on narrow windy roads\
  \ which by night seemed like five hundred. Our initial destination \u2013 romantic\
  \ camping place in Serra da Estrela mountains \u2013 turned out to be an abandoned\
  \ waste ground with a couple of barking dogs. And now, not far before midnight,\
  \ I get no sign of life in the only reachable hotel booked right afterwards that\
  \ sad discovery.\n\nSuddenly I hear voices. They clearly come from outside my head.\
  \ Turning around I see light in about hundred meters and, rushing closer, discover\
  \ a house, a car and several people hugging and waving good-bye to an old woman,\
  \ supposedly a host. For a moment I forget rain and pain - they look so genuinely\
  \ happy that my heart clenches nostalgically about loved ones back home. My unconscious\
  \ gazing gets me noticed.\n\n\u2018Sleep?\u2019 \u2013 she gestures putting two\
  \ hands together to the right ear and bending her head.  She has curly dark hair\
  \ and kind brown eyes. I nod pointing in direction of the hotel. \u2018Sleep here?\u2019\
  \ \u2013 she takes my hand and leads me to her house. Her hand feels warm, her voice\
  \ gentle. \n\nAnd here she stands opening a wardrobe full to the top with blankets,\
  \ quickly performing some magic with fireplace and showing me how to turn on warm\
  \ water in the bathroom. Then she gestures a spoon near her mouth. I stammer inventorying\
  \ in my mind our lunch leftovers while voices in my stomach get louder and, probably,\
  \ heard. \n\nIn no time I\u2019m sitting in a mighty chair with my legs barely touching\
  \ the floor listening to the wood cracking in fireplace and fearing this sweet dream\
  \ might come to an end still before dinner. She disappears to the fridge, then stove,\
  \ then cupboard coming back with plates, forks, glasses, potatoes, meat, salad,\
  \ home-made cake. Finally, she puts on a big round table covered by beautifully\
  \ embroidered tablecloth a bottle of home wine. She just had her family exactly\
  \ to the same meal as now the two foreigners who still haven\u2019t introduced themselves.\n\
  \n-\t\u2018Rosa. Tia Rosa\u2019 \u2013 she says welcoming us to the food. \n\nWe\
  \ eat. We talk. She speaks only Portuguese so English and German are of no use.\
  \ Soon we give up languages \u2013 can do even better without. Feeling of comfort\
  \ and warmth takes over as the food disappears. And by now I know about her youth\
  \ spent trekking in these mountains, her husband who passed away several years ago\
  \ and is observing us from the framed picture in the cupboard, her kids and grandkids.\
  \ My husband tells his grandma\u2019s name was also Rosa. We share our lives and\
  \ stories. \n\nThen she utters: \u2018Oh, fruits\u2019 \u2013 fruits from her garden.\
  \ She brings cherries and apricots. I try one hesitantly \u2013 I love fruits but\
  \ recently got allergic to those. She looks at me, then takes an apricot, a knife\
  \ and starts peeling. I watch her wrinkled hands with soil leftovers under the nails\
  \ gracefully taking thin cover off, hands that grow those apricots, hands that work\
  \ and hands that care. And while peeling and taking turns in handing one to me,\
  \ one to my husband, she talks, just like my grandma, complaining I should eat more,\
  \ should not stay up late, should wear proper clothes. Words irritating one in youth\
  \ but words missed desperately when you get older and fewer and fewer people care\
  \ to tell you those\u2026 I forget the allergies, I eat and enjoy.\n\nMorning comes\
  \ and the surroundings, including that two-story manor, look much more welcoming.\
  \ Hot coffee, delicious breakfast and off we go. She waves until the car gets out\
  \ of sight. Or maybe longer? Tia Rosa. Just like the grandma\u2026. I put my hand\
  \ in the bag with cherries and apricots she prepared for us. Food and care. The\
  \ two simple things that can light up the darkest and warm up the coldest night."
