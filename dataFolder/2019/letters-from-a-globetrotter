Text: "Dear Ryan,\n\nIt\u2019s so sunny, yet so cold in the Himalayas today. The warmth\
  \ of the sun has brightened my mood. Cheerful travelers from Ireland are sipping\
  \ local chai and discussing their next destination near my teeny-tiny home-stay.\
  \ Tittle-tattle in the sun, isn\u2019t it the best way to spend a winter afternoon?\
  \ I miss doing the same with you.\n\nIt\u2019s my fourth day in the mountains and\
  \ I have so many stories up in my sleeve. And the hardest part is to decide, which\
  \ stories are worth telling. When you have thousands of moving experiences, you\
  \ come face to face with the nuances and subtleties of life. And then regular coffee-table\
  \ gossip that we share as stories start to seem facile and meaningless. The stories\
  \ that stay and remain in you post travel are always the one that gives you a reason\
  \ to live, a reason to write.\n\nI left Tagdah yesterday and moved to a tiny village\
  \ near Sandakphu, called Tumling. Located at an altitude of 9,600 ft, Tumling is\
  \ a hamlet in the eastern Himalayas. It is 13 km from Manebhanjan, which is another\
  \ 1 hr 15 min drive from Darjeeling. As I approached Tumling, I started noticing\
  \ small cottages and huts from a distance. Right at the center of Tumling, there\
  \ is a lovely view point which is more like an open field. On a clear sunny day,\
  \ like today, from the edge of this area, you get the magnificent views of the Kanchenjunga\
  \ snow peaks.\n\nI have acclimatized not just to the weather but also to the people\
  \ around. Here I am staying with a local family in their cottage. They are a family\
  \ of three. A young woman name Binsa and her septuagenarian mother and father. Both\
  \ frail and wrinkled but with eyes sparkling with kindness, welcomed me in their\
  \ home-stay with a soup of noodles, chicken and boiled vegetables. A local dish,\
  \ popularly named as \u201DThupka\u201D.\n\nRight now I am sitting on their worn\
  \ out carpet, beside the fireplace. Talking to them about my life in Kolkata and\
  \ at the same time writing back to you. We talked about Sandakphu. How in summer\
  \ it turns into a comfortable trekking destination for thousands of tourists who\
  \ take the perilous Sandakphu-Phalut trek route. Binsa and her family host many\
  \ of them. It is their main source of income.\n\nI will leave Tumling tomorrow.\
  \ My next stop is New Jalpaiguri. Yes I am finally returning home. After having\
  \ a sumptuous dinner, I went to Binsa\u2019s mother to clear my bills. She gifted\
  \ me hand-knitted woolen socks, saying \u201CIt\u2019ll keep your feet warm\u201D\
  . I gingerly clutched the socks and hugged her. She smelled like my mom. I felt\
  \ a little homesick, I guess. That\u2019s the thing I love about travel. It stumps\
  \ you with kindness and belongings. Surprises you when you least expect it. You\
  \ go out as a stranger, and come back as someone whose has friends even in the oddest\
  \ part of the world. Traveling takes you away from all the religions and brings\
  \ you closer to the only religion that matters, humanity. And that is the reason\
  \ Binsa\u2019s family made me feel at home in this foreign place.\n\nI have to go\
  \ now. It\u2019s already 1 AM. I must get some sleep. I will write back to you whenever\
  \ I get a chance. Keep me posted. I really enjoy your stories and the details of\
  \ your life in the other half of the world.\n\nAlways moving, always returning,\n\
  Aditi."
