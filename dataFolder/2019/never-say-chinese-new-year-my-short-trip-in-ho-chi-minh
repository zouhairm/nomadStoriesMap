Text: "I planned my Vietnam trip for a long time. But I guess I am not really good\
  \ with planning when I booked a ticket from Manila to Ho Chi Minh, with a five hour\
  \ layover in Singapore. Those five hours were spent going around the Changi Airport,\
  \ stopping at pop-up bookstores, drooling on books I can\u2019t buy. When I arrived\
  \ in Ho Chi Minh, I noticed that the weather was sunny and humid. I felt like I\
  \ never left Manila. I told myself that I will relax and forget my work for a while,\
  \ but when I stepped out of the airplane, all I did was observe Vietnamese culture.\
  \ I guess overthinking runs in my blood. \nTen minutes of my life stopped when I\
  \ saw the immigration officer punched himself while asking questions about my stay.\
  \ I realized that he was just trying to stay awake at work, so I moved on and thought\
  \ of it as a wonderful welcome in the city. \n\nMy first night was spent with a\
  \ motor ride in the capital. I was told that an average household in Vietnam owns\
  \ three to four motorcycles, which makes it their primary mode of transportation.\
  \ I can say that my driver was truly an expert of Ho Chi Minh streets. He drives\
  \ so fast even if there were few traffic lights and the streets were wet because\
  \ of rain.  I realized that motorcycle rides can be fun too, especially if done\
  \ in Vietnam.\n\nThe next day, I decided to learn more from its people and history\
  \ through a free local tour I found online. My guide and I was supposed to meet\
  \ at the Saigon Central Post Office, but I was late for the tour. As I enter the\
  \ post office, I saw piles of books that were on sale. I must admit that books are\
  \ my weakness. I promised myself that I will not buy anything \u201Cacademic\u201D\
  , but I realized that it can be a good memento for my trip. Books can be a test\
  \ of self-control in budget when travelling. Almost all traveling scholars can attest\
  \ to that.\n\nAfter an hour, I have decided to go around the city alone. While I\
  \ was on my way out of the post office, I saw a young man wearing a shirt with the\
  \ words \u201CSaigon Tour\u201D written on its back. I approached him, introduced\
  \ myself, and I apologized for being late. He just smiled and started the tour immediately.\
  \ My guide was Khoa, a marketing student from Ho Chi Minh. I felt a little awkward\
  \ to be on a tour alone, but I love listening to him as he tries to explain the\
  \ history of their city. I study the concept of decolonization in Asia, and I love\
  \ to see concrete evidences of how former colonies tried to withdraw from the influences\
  \ of their former colonizers. I also noticed that stores were decorated with red\
  \ lanterns, so I asked him how they celebrate the Chinese New Year in Vietnam. He\
  \ immediately gave me a blank stare and said, \u201CIf you do not want to get punched\
  \ in Vietnam, never say Chinese New Year, it is Tet\u201D. Then he kept quiet and\
  \ never explained further.  \n\nI have taught Asian history for some time, and trips\
  \ like this is a chance to know more information from the locals about the topics\
  \ I discuss in class.  As we go around the city, I noticed how Vietnamese words\
  \ were written. I asked Khoa how to pronounce it and I terribly fail on how I say\
  \ words such as \xD3c Eo and Nguy\u1EC5n. Vietnamese words are phonetically unique,\
  \ and it will always be an advantage to learn it from a native speaker.\n\nAfter\
  \ a day of a meaningful tour around the city, we decided to say our farewells. \
  \ It was a wonderful short trip in Vietnam, and the best lesson I learned is the\
  \ importance of taking a break, and learning how to appreciate the world around\
  \ you. Work and school can be challenging sometimes, and it is important to travel\
  \ and immerse oneself with people, places and culture that will surely give us lessons\
  \ that are valuable in this journey called life."
