Text: "As I write this, I'm sitting on my bed in a small room in Civitanova Marche,\
  \ Italy. If I listen hard enough, I can hear the sea. The wind. A million different\
  \ opportunities knocking on my window overlooking the Adriatic- some of them I asked\
  \ for, some of them I never ever dreamed of. They all have something in common:\
  \ I want to take them all. \n\nI arrived here less than a month ago, two suitcases\
  \ that I thought would be impossible to carry (spoiler alert: I did manage to do\
  \ so) and all of my savings in my wallet. I took two planes and three trains, and\
  \ 28 hours after leaving the only home I've ever known in Buenos Aires, Argentina,\
  \ I reached my destination: a town I had never visited before, where they speak\
  \ a language I haven't fully mastered yet, no friends, no full time job, only my\
  \ faith and my dreams. \n\nWhat am I doing here, you may wonder. I moved to Italy\
  \ because this is where my family came from. I moved to Italy because I wanted to\
  \ go back to my roots, find out what it was like, see it for myself, write a new\
  \ chapter of my story. I had a lot of doubts and a lot of fear before coming here,\
  \ and I haven't left all of my anxieties behind me yet, but I'm almost there. I'm\
  \ here, opposite to a month ago when I was several miles away dreaming of what it\
  \ would be like if I dared to do this. You see, ever since I was born I've had this\
  \ intense feeling, this idea that wouldn't let me be: I had to travel, I had to\
  \ see places, I had to see the world. I had to go back to where my grandparents'\
  \ grandparents took the steps that led them to become immigrants in South America.\
  \ All of my life I had wanted the same: to become an immigrant myself. \n\nHow is\
  \ it like here? I imagined living in Europe would involve visiting museums a lot\
  \ more. The small town I'm in is quiet, there is only one library, one theatre,\
  \ a museum that's always closed for some reason. I did visit Florence for four days\
  \ and became forever enamoured with the art there. I'm planning to see more of Italy\
  \ as soon as I can. But the thing is, aren't those all things only tourists do?\
  \ Right now, I'm focusing on becoming a local. I don't want to be a tourist in a\
  \ country I have always loved and felt as my own. \n\nI'm learning Italian. I'm\
  \ learning to cook their food properly. I walk three, four, sometimes even five\
  \ miles a day with the sea as my only companion. I write a lot (I'm a writer after\
  \ all, the other thing I was sure I was born to do ever since I was a child). Somedays\
  \ are easy and full of adventure, a sense of wonder invading me every single minute,\
  \ the feeling that possibilities are endless. The certainty that the world is mine\
  \ to take and that this will be worth my while. Some days don't feel like mine at\
  \ all. They pass by in a blur and I don't even leave my small house in front of\
  \ the beach, my mood as blue as the sea that Regina Spektor once described as 'a\
  \ wetter version of the sky', a quote I remember every time I look at the Adriatic.\
  \ \n\nBut wasn't this what I was after? Wasn't this what I came here to do? This\
  \ trip is more about finding where life could take me, where my intuition is leading\
  \ me, and less about visiting interesting places and eating out or hanging out with\
  \ other young turists. This has always been about jumping headfirst into the unknown.\
  \ A month ago, I did not only took two planes and three trains to get here. I also\
  \ took a leap of faith. I think in due time it will pay off."
