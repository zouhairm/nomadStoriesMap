Text: "Thailand. Koh Samui. Shops perched along the Ring Road like scarecrows hugging\
  \ each other after a muggy day. It storms, still there are scooters hurtling on\
  \ both ways, carrying some funny-dressed tourist. The rain flows sideways and runs\
  \ down the road, creating little waterfalls gushing into smaller, downhill streets.\n\
  \nAs we follow the rain, a new street, parallel to the Ring Road, unravels. It seems\
  \ to be the new-born of the last, where each characteristic is smaller, but incredibly\
  \ enhanced. Noises are louder, tourists are doubled, shops are messier and livelier.\
  \ The Lamai area offers the typical Thai experience: a mix of the authentic and\
  \ unspoiled with the fun international vibe of the night and the comfortable relax\
  \ by the seaside.\n\nIt was my first intracontinental experience, and I didn't expect\
  \ to find what the beauty in the ordinary meant. I was an unexperienced traveller,\
  \ holding a passport and not an ID for the first time. The backpack felt heavy on\
  \ my back, but the challenge intensified each emotion exponentially. \n\nOne day,\
  \ I was walking down the centre, when an art shop grasped my attention. I remember\
  \ the colours exploding out of the front door and uncountable paintings huddled\
  \ in the corners of the room. Inside, a smiling Thai lady was welcoming the guests.\
  \ Her loose, floral dress looked in perfect harmony with the place. \u201CI am the\
  \ owner\u201D, she said. She spoke English gently, in a maternal tone, and showed\
  \ me around.\n \nThe artists were quiet, focused, each with his own story. There\
  \ was one painting tigers since he was ten. Another one who took his first paintbrush\
  \ when he was only eight, to paint the toffee candy that his father handed him that\
  \ day. Now they both create Impressionistic art.\n\nYet, the most striking story\
  \ is Sen Pun\u2019s. He was upstairs, alone, in the quietest room, painting the\
  \ same subject over and over: the Buddha. I was enchanted. I must have had my jaw\
  \ dropped to the collarbones, because the owner smiled, told Sen Pun something in\
  \ Thai and reported me his answer: \u201CIt makes me feel happy when I see the excitement\
  \ in the tourists\u2019 eyes when they look at my art\u201D. Curious, I asked why\
  \ the Buddha has been his only subject for years. His answer was simple, logical,\
  \ faithful: \u201CTourists consist of most of my clients, which means my art travels\
  \ around. This is why I feel it is important that it is authentic\u201D. \n\nHis\
  \ mission: a chance to change the world by entering the buyers\u2019 houses with\
  \ his art. The Buddha\u2019s face is an image of peace and the Thai tradition fully\
  \ embraces this concept. With his art, Sen Pun wants to protect the traditional\
  \ Thai art and spread peace all around the world, because, as he added, \u201Cart\
  \ stays\u201D.\n\nStill fascinated by the simple, yet sublime art history of the\
  \ place, I head back to the front door, thankfully bowing goodbye to these inspiring\
  \ people creating the extraordinary out of the ordinary. I had just turned my back\
  \ when I heard \u201CWait!\u201D. I looked at the woman, suddenly flanked by one\
  \ of the artists. \u201CHe wants to give you something\u201D. He handed me a tiny\
  \ casket, with a see-through top and a bottom side covered in red velvet. Golden\
  \ Thai words were written on top. And inside, lying on the velvet, a Buddha. \u201C\
  This is for protection. Buddha keeps the evil away.\u201D she explained, using her\
  \ hands to \u201Cpush the evil\u201D off of her. Then, she looked up, softly curving\
  \ up the sides of her lips. \u201CYou came in and brought joy and smiles, now we\
  \ want you to preserve it forever\u201D. That little Buddha is still with me today,\
  \ in that same pencil case that followed my academic experience around the world.\n\
  \nThat day, I realized that beauty lies, unrevealed, in the smallest details. When\
  \ you are alone and spontaneous, a wanderer by mind rather than by feet, try to\
  \ look for beauty somewhere else. Don\u2019t search for it, let it come to you.\
  \ While strolling around the busy streets, absorb the different energies electrifying\
  \ the place. Look deeper into it. Can you see the beauty in the ordinary?"
