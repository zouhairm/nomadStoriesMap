Text: "I never knew the Calla Lily Festival was a thing until I came to Taipei. And\
  \ now, even if the season has not yet officially started, here I am surrounded by\
  \ terraced fields dotted with the tall white flowers. People have flocked to Zhuzihu,\
  \ a small village in the Yangmingshan\u2019s Park north of Taipei, certainly helped\
  \ by the easy transport system the city is blessed with. All the signs on MRT and\
  \ buses are both in traditional Mandarin Chinese and in English, allowing other\
  \ waiguo ren like me to find their way around. I haven\u2019t been walking for long\
  \ but as I pass by a frog themed small coffee shop I decide to stop for a snack.\
  \ I\u2019m welcomed by a young lady and offered a seat outdoors. While she positions\
  \ the chair so that I can sit in the sun, she leaves three laminated handwritten\
  \ pages on my table: the menu has sweet and savoury snacks as well as a number of\
  \ different teas, hot or cold. I take a look around, to other tourists who decided\
  \ to pick their own calla lily from the field and are now wearing rented full leg\
  \ rubber boots and rubber aprons to protect themselves. They will soon walk along\
  \ the lines of flowers which are grown in muddy soil. The sound of running water\
  \ fills the air, along with the occasional bird chirping. I consider that, come\
  \ the evening, there certainly must be croaking frogs adding to the soundtrack of\
  \ the place. This area used to be a lake of volcanic origins and has turned into\
  \ calla lily fields. The lady of the coffee shop approaches me to show me a jar\
  \ with a tiny green frog inside: now I understand where the coffee shop theme comes\
  \ from.\n-\tBella!, I observe, inadvertently reverting to my native language.\n\
  -\tAh, sei italiana? Io parlo italiano!\n\nOf all the places, I did not expect to\
  \ find someone speaking Italian here, in the middle of Taiwanese countryside.\n\
  -\tE dove l\u2019hai imparato?, I ask, where have you learned it?\n\nSo Mya tells\
  \ me she\u2019s been in Italy for about one year.\n-\tWhere in Italy were you?\n\
  -\tBergamo.\n\nOk, that\u2019s also unusual. The common reply is Florence, Rome,\
  \ Venice. Even Milan is for people who go back a second time. Mya goes inside to\
  \ pick up my order, and while I enjoy a delicious vanilla flavoured cheese cake\
  \ I ask more questions.\n-\tMy aunt lives in Bergamo, she explains. She is married\
  \ to an Italian, and I stayed with her. I was there a first time for one year and\
  \ then a second time for one more year, to study.\n-\tAnd what did you study there?\n\
  -\tHow to cook!, she replies merrily. This is what I do here.\n\nAnd well she cooks,\
  \ at least this cheesecake is memorable. But I have to move forward, if I\u2019\
  m lucky I\u2019ll find cherry blossoms further on in the park. Mya is helping some\
  \ other tourist with the gears to go lily picking when I say goodbye, and as she\
  \ comes back with her Arrivederci! I can see a couple of other waiguo ren turning\
  \ in surprise."
