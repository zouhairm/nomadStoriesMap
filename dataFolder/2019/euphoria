Text: "No one could have ever said this any better than what it's always been said,\"\
  Life's short. Explore. Risk. Live.\" \nSo I finally bought my ticket to the only\
  \ country I really wanted to but was afraid to travel to.. the States. Captivating\
  \ Enough. Gathering all the courage I had mustered  up,I walked through the airport\
  \ to find my \"oh,so looong distance friend\" waving excitedly at me to take me\
  \ to her place. As I stepped out of the airport,the Cali winds welcomed me with\
  \ so much warmth that I actually closed my eyes and breathed in. The way to her\
  \ place wasn't very busy luckily that day but the sky was clear and the roads had\
  \ a hint of the rain from a few hours earlier and the breeze made justice to my\
  \ homesick stomach. Surrounded by beautiful orchards and trees was my friend's neighborhood.\
  \ She decided to take me out to the Disneyland to relive our childhood memories\
  \ of Disney Princesses or in my case.. the beauty's beast? Eh. The Disneyland was\
  \ everything I had never expected. We have had our favorite ice creams,all of the\
  \ rides and swings I might have never agreed to do with anyone before. Bought a\
  \ Mini mouse headband for myself and her and watched the colourful fireworks ..\
  \ the colourful bursts of the fireworks made it seem like we were all young again..\
  \ hopeful,innocent but intense. The fireworks subsided and we headed towards the\
  \ famous"
