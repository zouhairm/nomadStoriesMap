Text: "The top of an enormous cruise ship floats above terraced rooftops and terracotta\
  \ tiles. My legs fill with a peculiar ground-level vertigo. It hovers like a long\
  \ white spaceship or a strange bird, observing Venetian life as it crawls through\
  \ the lagoon; the windows of its many-eyed face carving out spherical snapshots\
  \ of the floating city. Fresh off the airport vaporetto and still acclimatising\
  \ to my watery surroundings, I was met with a local-tourist dynamic that bears the\
  \ weight of cruise-ship sized tensions. Venice, however, was not my destination.\
  \ The final leg of my journey was a brief boat trip to the long, narrow sandbar\
  \ called the Lido. \n\nThe Lido, once the glamorous epicentre of beach bathing,\
  \ grand hotels and casinos, is now a quiet backwater where Venetians and summer\
  \ visitors alike flock to sunbathe and escape the stifling heat and tourist crush\
  \ of Venice in the summer. Now, in early evening, as Venetians return to their homes,\
  \ the Lido feels suspended in a hot, muggy torpor. Stillness seems to breathe out\
  \ from the quiet green waterways, the faded grandeur of the architecture, and the\
  \ locals who watch the crowds arrive by day and disappear with the sun. .  A hybrid\
  \ of old and new Venetian life, The Lido materialised from the way modern life pushes\
  \ in through old spaces; facades preserved, but gaps filling with modern apartments,\
  \ tourist shops, even a couple of supermarkets. Charming in it\u2019s own particular\
  \ way, it is the slow-paced sister of mainland Venice. Surprisingly, there is an\
  \ abundance of small, old-fashioned cars on the island \u2013 oddly shaped vehicles\
  \ that hark back to another era and tear, Italian style, along the narrow roads;\
  \ bicycles swerve and teeter out of their way down one-way streets. \n\nThe summer\
  \ I spent there was marked by a heat wave and a returning thunderstorm. During the\
  \ heat we ate sliced red peaches outside under a heavy, yellow-hued sky. As the\
  \ days went by, darker clouds rolled in and brought thunder, lightning and rain\
  \ that pierced the swollen air. We watched the silver forks of lightning fall over\
  \ Venice and sound across the lagoon. One day we were on the beach when the dark\
  \ clouds spread across the sky, bringing a fierce wind. We hid inside the cabana\
  \ in the dark. Then, one after the other everyone ran into the wild and numinous\
  \ sea. We returned home with an unfamiliar chill. \n\nThe third Sunday in July is\
  \ Redentore: an ancient festival celebrating the end of the plague in 1576, and\
  \ marked by extravagant fireworks. Towards sunset, my Italian host family took a\
  \ boat, decorated with fairy lights, out to St Mark\u2019s Basin with a cooler box\
  \ of ice cream. The lagoon filled with boats of all kinds \u2013 raucous parties,\
  \ families eating and drinking, quiet lovers. The lagoon filled with boats of all\
  \ kinds \u2013 raucous parties, families eating and drinking, quiet spectators.\
  \ The fireworks unfolded from the sky just as the lightning had before. It was one\
  \ of the kids\u2019 first Redentore, and soon they grew tired of all the excitement\
  \ and fell asleep. \n\nOn the way back to the Lido, after all of the boats had somehow,\
  \ in some invisible system or agreement, left the lagoon, I also closed my eyes\
  \ for a bit. Scenes of Venetian life replayed themselves; the tiny details and langorous\
  \ pace of life in The Lido had left its imprint in my memory. Perhaps, I reflected,\
  \ the true beauty of experiencing a place is when you are not required to see everything\
  \ and check all the boxes; you can close your eyes on the splendours in front of\
  \ you and still feel the essence of being in that place. I think back to the unseeing,\
  \ gargantuan bulk of the cruise-ship, at once too close and very far away from the\
  \ truth of this unique collection of lagoon islands. When I opened my eyes again,\
  \ a pair of large, brown, seven-year-old eyes were staring back at me above the\
  \ kind of smile children have when they catch you unawares."
