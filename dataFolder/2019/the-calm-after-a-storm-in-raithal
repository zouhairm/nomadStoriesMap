Text: "Some bright warm rays after a series of cold and stormy days were essentially\
  \ longed for. \nIt was my third day at the beautiful settlement of Raithal, 40 Kms\
  \ ahead of Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand, and I was yearning to see sun. After losing\
  \ two days to thunderstorms, I was eagerly hoping to be able step out and walk around\
  \ through the village.  My struggle for having to reach that place, juggling through\
  \ various unusual means of transport at odd hours of the day, in a beautiful yet\
  \ difficult landscape, all seemed to go off the drain with the weather hindering\
  \ my plans on the trip.  I was lodging in a local home stay with a beautiful room\
  \ view. The breath-taking view of the mighty mountain range kept my patience on\
  \ point. The hosts of the home-stay were a lovely family who dropped by to check\
  \ upon me every few hours. They had specifically warned me from stepping out in\
  \ the bad weather. It was the last week of March and the weather conditions weren\u2019\
  t anticipated by them either. It was the season of sowing potatoes and it hindered\
  \ their agricultural produce.\nWith the third day bringing no sun-rays on ground,\
  \ my ray of hope was diminishing. It had gotten all dark and extremely windy. I\
  \ heard the neighbouring residents communicate loudly, ensuring each other\u2019\
  s safety. They rushed towards their cattle and tied them indoors. It took half the\
  \ day for the storm to calm. I almost lost another day to the silly weather. Having\
  \ waited eagerly for long, I checked for the gush of the wind and as it seemed to\
  \ have calmed down, I walked out of my room to the balcony. The air smelt as fresh\
  \ as the mountain snow. It was pleasantly satisfying. Without wasting another minute\
  \ I climbed down the crooked stairs and trailed down to the most interesting spot\
  \ of the village. It was the east periphery of the settlement which housed a gigantic\
  \ traditional house standing tall for the past 500 years almost. I had seen images\
  \ of it but when I stood there in real, I was awestruck. My eyes couldn\u2019t fathom\
  \ what they saw. As a practice I carry my sketchbook and paint along where ever\
  \ I travel and having carried my bag there, I looked around for a place to sit in\
  \ order to sketch it down and document. As I began, I got completely involved in\
  \ it in a while, not realizing where I was seated and who I was surrounded by, I\
  \ went on sketching. In some time, I started hearing voices reaching out to me.\
  \ I was a stranger in the surroundings who had hijacked someone\u2019s terrace and\
  \ was seated, all lost and drawing things they couldn\u2019t follow until it was\
  \ completed.\n Every passer-by was curious to find out my details and what I was\
  \ trying to do. I responded to every \u201CAap kahan se aye ho?\u201D,\u201CAap\
  \ ka naam kya hai?\u201D  and\n\u201CAap kya bana rahe ho?,\u201D politely. \nThe\
  \ people around exhibited a little more excitement about a stranger\u2019s involvement\
  \ in their heritage and surroundings. In the meanwhile, I heard a voice calling\
  \ out for me. It was a middle aged lady in her traditional Garhwali attire, carrying\
  \ a cane woven basket on her back. She appeared to be returning from the forest.\
  \ As my brain was stuck with the particulars of her apparel and the commonness of\
  \ the red fabric every woman in the village tied around their waist, she smilingly\
  \ complimented my painting and invited me over for some \u2018chai\u2019. I was\
  \ pleased by the gesture,. She took me over to meet other people in the neighbourhood\
  \ and introduced me to everyone. We all talked over a cup of chai and shared about\
  \ each other. I was touched by their hospitality. They took me around the village\
  \ and introduced me to every passer-by and shared stories of the place. The people\
  \ are warm and welcoming. Their culture and tradition is rooted and unaltered. Within\
  \ no time I felt a connection for that place.\nIt was one of the most beautiful\
  \ experiences of a place and having explored it all alone, it holds a very special\
  \ place."
