Text: "I have to admit it was a donut run to me, but well deserved in my eyes, craving\
  \ sugar after a long day of sweating at the work site  My team and I, composed of\
  \ about fifteen families were busy building a small stucco house for a family in\
  \ Mexico and after a days work completing our goals for the day, the older members\
  \ of our team decided to  buy a new refrigerator for our host family, with the extra\
  \ money raised for our trip, and with that notion we decided to all travel together\
  \ to a local supermarket. Upon arrival, a group of foreigners in a local store is\
  \ quite a sight to see, I imagine in the eyes of the locals, the group of us split\
  \ into our groups of the older members looking for refrigerator and the younger\
  \ members' purpose of finding Mexican sweets. Buying candy, donuts, and after checking\
  \ out finding a ice cream stand.  \nMy friend offered to pay for my sister and me,\
  \ he took out twenty U.S dollars, I glanced at the colorful decorated chalk board\
  \ with the prices, only a couple peso I remember, as soon as the cashier saw the\
  \ twenty dollars he gesturing to us that the payment was good. I'm not good with\
  \ math but three ice cream  cones for twenty dollars seem a bit too much or on the\
  \ flip side either really good ice cream. My friend handed him the twenty, and we\
  \ received our cold treat , but no change back,  I was still left with confusion,\
  \ i felt like we got ripped off. As we are walking back to our cars, my friend knew\
  \ what had happened, but he assured me calmly, \"he needed it more than we do.\"\
  \ I never thought of it like that beside it's only twenty dollars. As we are walking\
  \ out of the store, I see families on the out side benches, eating ice cream, seeing\
  \ them made me realized what really matters: people, material good, are replaceable,\
  \ but people are not, I feel grateful just to see them,\nhopefully they did not\
  \ have to pay as much as we did, but it does not even matter anymore about the price\
  \ but realizing in poverty stricken country, a twenty is worth more."
