Text: "In the moment that I believed I was about to be abducted, two guilt-stained\
  \ thoughts lodged themselves in the forefront of my mind. The first was the memory\
  \ of thirty freshly-printed pages that my grandmother\u2019s arthritic hands had\
  \ thrust toward me only two days before: her well-intentioned, albeit exhaustive\
  \ list of Ecuador\u2019s most common scams, diseases and natural disasters. The\
  \ second thought was that perhaps if I had bothered to give her research more than\
  \ a cursory glance, I might have avoided my current predicament. At the time, my\
  \ longing for fried plantains and bragging rights had overridden any desire to read\
  \ about the intricacies of a chiggers infestation. A reverberating screech of nearby\
  \ car horns brought me out of reverie and back onto the cobbled alley in which I\
  \ stood. My eyes roved over the stranger in front of me-  older, with a weathered\
  \ face and smartly vested in a sports jacket and pressed chinos-  and down to his\
  \ gnarled hand wrapped tightly around my forearm. My gut bubbled with fear and I\
  \ glared at the map clutched in my sweaty palm. That slip of paper had so effortlessly\
  \ betrayed my na\xEFvet\xE9 and status as an extranjera, a foreigner. Hadn\u2019\
  t I been warned plenty of times that something like this would happen? Had I not\
  \ been advised against traveling alone?  \n\nThe man roughly tugged at my arm and\
  \ pointed in the direction of a dusty pick-up truck parked across the narrow street.\
  \ Was I being given an option or a command? I jerked my head \"no\", shook my arm\
  \ free of his grasp and backed into the cool stone of the wall behind me. Low, tiled\
  \ roofs I had found so charming minutes earlier now cast constricting shadows. I\
  \ felt his hand snatch at my arm once more and as he pulled me into the street the\
  \ incessant honking that permeated Quito escalated from nuisance to threatening\
  \ roar. My body went woozy with the dread of being driven to an unknown location.\
  \  And then, instead of shoving me into his truck as I had anticipated, he resolutely\
  \ turned heel and towed me uphill while grumpily muttering in a language I did not\
  \ yet understand. My fear displaced by confusion, I took stock of my situation and\
  \ realized that he held my map in one hand, each of his sharp turns preceded by\
  \ quick glances at its crumpled face. \n\nThe altitude of Quito\u2019s hills and\
  \ the pace of his march had left my blood feeling like oatmeal. In my oxygen-deprived\
  \ brain I feebly questioned the ineptitude of a kidnapper that needed to regularly\
  \ confirm his own geographic location. Without slackening his grip or letting up\
  \ his steady stream of exasperated Spanish, he lugged me several more blocks uphill.\
  \ As the streets widened, the sky bloomed overhead and I began to make out the top\
  \ of a grassy slope. Abruptly, he stopped, placed the map in my hands and grandly\
  \ swept his arm in the direction of the greenery. \L\L\n\n\u201CAqu\xED, Parque\
  \ Itchimbia.\u201D\n\n \L\LI stared stupidly at those same words on my map. Words\
  \ that I had so eagerly circled before I set out that morning and found myself lost\
  \ in the crooked elbow of a side street. With a terse nod of his head, my guide\
  \ bid adieu and commenced his descent back into the cool alleyways from which we\
  \ had come. Chastised, I made my way to a small stone bench and looked out over\
  \ the sprawling city below.  Nowhere in my grandmother's extensive research had\
  \ it mentioned the self-inflicted dangers of my congenital arrogance."
