Text: "Food for the soul. Four perfect words for me would be these. Discovering new\
  \ cultures and exploring your deeper self, uncovering the unexpected mindful corners.\
  \ Interacting with people around the world and covering the little places on this\
  \ round world. Isn't it beautiful to know there's one more place where you could\
  \ belong to. And upon travelling discovering you would belong too. The beauty the\
  \ buildings breathe, the stories bricks narate, the way the streets seduce a traveller\
  \ to uncover the experiences is just breathtaking. Yes, too romantic and historic,\
  \ being an architect you start picking up the eye for detail and a meaning in every\
  \ tale. \n\nTravelling is just another step to self discovery and indulging into\
  \ the world. Crossing \"bucket\" lists, scratching places off the maps, discovering\
  \ stories to people and soo much more. It gives our minds a new perspective to look\
  \ a things, a new mindset, a new outlook, a little new human.\nA little time away\
  \ from one reality to another. Just like how books are to a bookworm, travel is\
  \ to a soulsearcher . Since I'm both! \nIt can be overwhleming but could give a\
  \ reality check as well. Sharing your experinces with others and getting stories\
  \ for them is the most exciting. Bright, fresh, explored faces is something to look\
  \ forward to."
