Text: "Only a winner\u2019s occasional whoop interrupts the bells and whistles accompanying\
  \ the flashing lights of the slot machines. Piles of chips multiply and vanish on\
  \ green, felt-covered tables as waitresses walk the aisles, chirping, \u201CCocktails\
  \ anyone?\u201D\nAs clouds of smoke rise above them, gamblers nervously eye the\
  \ dice rolls, spinning roulette wheels and falling cards. Newcomers eagerly wait\
  \ for a loser to bust or a winner to cash out so they can sit.\nThe amount of money\
  \ flowing out of the players\u2019 wallets and purses is mind-boggling, but no one\
  \ seems fazed.\nThis is downtown Las Vegas, ground zero of the renowned premiere\
  \ adult playground, also known as Sin City and the largest gambling mecca in the\
  \ world. The gritty scene inside and outside the casinos in the entertainment district,\
  \ known as the Fremont Street Experience, rival New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.\
  \ The party rocks all night, all week long.\nIn recent years, word drifted across\
  \ the country that the old Las Vegas, the one where tourists felt free to indulge\
  \ in wretched excess of every kind, no longer existed. That\u2019s not true in the\
  \ center of the city.\nThe giant casino hotels on the Las Vegas Strip \u2014 the\
  \ ones that feature the big concerts and other shows \u2014 embrace a cleaner, more\
  \ wholesome atmosphere. But Fremont Street remains as wild and crazy as ever.\n\
  When the guests at the large casino hotels want to indulge in a little hedonism,\
  \ they climb on board the shuttle that runs between the Strip and downtown in search\
  \ of more excitement. There they find virtually naked men and women standing on\
  \ the pedestrian-only street, promoting commercial and personal agendas. Two of\
  \ the more unusual posers stood out in the raucous crowd: a woman wearing the headdress\
  \ of a nun, pasties, a black bikini bottom and high heels, and a man wearing only\
  \ a pink thong. Both sought \u201Ctips.\u201D\nThe hotels above the casinos are\
  \ nice, but the district gets loud late at night. The street is covered by a canopy,\
  \ and it features a zip line at the top for anyone daring enough to seek that high\
  \ rush.\nIt\u2019s clear why so many visitors to Las Vegas go for only three nights;\
  \ a longer visit might not only bankrupt, it would leave you thoroughly exhausted.\
  \ The body can only take so much punishment, and the bank account is likely to give\
  \ out even faster.\nThat\u2019s when the entertainment venues on the Strip become\
  \ more appealing to gamblers.\nOnly Las Vegas can provide a forum for big-star performances\
  \ like Cher, Britney and Ricky Martin and their prop-heavy, sensational shows in\
  \ enormous theaters. Cirque du Soleil recently staged a performance of \u201CLove,\u201D\
  \ featuring Beatles music, at the Mirage with heavy emphasis on \u201CSgt. Pepper\u2019\
  s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\u201D\nNo one lucky enough to be there will ever forget\
  \ the props and performances by the acrobats, dancers and singers.\nA cab ride to\
  \ the Monte Carlo to see the Cher show became as entertaining as everything else\
  \ in Las Vegas. The cab driver also worked as a dealer in one of the big casinos,\
  \ and he shared his knowledge of Las Vegas. He said while Sin City is best known\
  \ for gambling, the biggest income generator has become the shows and conventions.\
  \ When the casinos and the shows both become too much, Las Vegas offers the Smith\
  \ Center for the Performing Arts and Discovery Museum in Symphony Park, the Neon\
  \ Museum, the Las Vegas History Museum, the DISCOVERY Children\u2019s Museum, the\
  \ Nevada State Museum and the Old Las Vegas Mormon State Historic Park.\nThe Downtown\
  \ Arts District, with numerous galleries, hosts the annual Las Vegas Film Festival,\
  \ and First Friday is a monthly celebration featuring exhibits of art, music and\
  \ food. Hoover Dam is another popular tourist draw, and tours of the Grand Canyon\
  \ and the Mojave Desert are available.\nSo it is a diverse city. Nevertheless, Las\
  \ Vegas will forever be linked with entertainment. Many of Las Vegas\u2019 residents\
  \ never step foot in the casinos, but few people who visit Sin City are able to\
  \ resist the lure of the slot machines and tables.\nIt\u2019s the sort of experience\
  \ most people like to try at least once."
