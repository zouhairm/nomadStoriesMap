  , said the shutters of all the shops in Jammu, as messengers of the exasperated\
  \ citizens trying to convey different emotions and waiting for a reply.\nMy mother\
  \ panicked on knowing that a police officer had been killed a day before our arrival\
  \ and the whole city was on red alert. Bombings, shootings, death and attacks were\
  \ a part of Jammu\u2019s daily routine.\n\u201CThe India and Pakistan partition\
  \ went exactly as planned\u201D, said a co-traveler. I couldn\u2019t agree more.\
  \ \n\nWith newly formed knowledge of a dark past, our trip to Ladakh began. Gulmarg\
  \ was our first stop. Taken straight from a painting were the wooden houses, with\
  \ impeccable greenery and freshness in every breath. Every colour could be recognized.\
  \ It seemed that the palate had been over flown with colours dancing in joy. The\
  \ photographer in me removed her DSLR and shot every picturesque view she saw. With\
  \ people narrating stories of their families, with red noses and trembling feet,\
  \ we realized that \u201CWinter Is Coming\u201D. Known as the Switzerland of India,\
  \ Jammu and Kashmir definitely lived up to its reputation. \n\nA news popped up\
  \ on my phone saying there was a gondola (cable car) fallen from a height of about\
  \ 3000 meters killing 7 people. I saw NDTV, Times of India, and several other curious\
  \ news channel vans entering the area and questioning the public. With my cousins\
  \ stuck in the trauma, all I could think of was their safety. \n\u201CDidi! I am\
  \ here! I am fine!\u201D, exclaimed my cousin, Palak, as she came running towards\
  \ me and my best friend, Isha.  Relieved and tired, we went back to our rooms as\
  \ the snow storm got worse.\n\nOn my journey next day, I only wondered on how the\
  \ media is playing a role in controlling our emotions and reality. How could they\
  \ know something happening 4 km away from me, before I could?  \n\u201CPOMP POMP\u201D\
  , the car\u2019s horn distracted my thoughts to a board welcoming us to Kargil.\
  \ Kargil- where the conflict between India and Pakistan was spoken by guns, wounds,\
  \ deaths and not words. With a museum of detailed history and operations, three\
  \ mountains being attacked, names of the martyrs on tombs, stood the Kargil Memorial\
  \ War. An open place with tall mountains surrounding the place, it screamed victory.\n\
  \nWe sat inside our buses and continued our ride for Ladakh. \nI entered Ladakh\
  \ and saw a wave of differently coloured people, some short, some angry, some fair\
  \ and some with a wide smile. The people had only one thing in common- a warm welcome.\
  \ With tiny cafes and many German bakeries, Ladakh made a special place in my heart.\
  \ No Wi-Fi, no network but there was warmth amidst the chaos and tiny markets. After\
  \ a beautiful visit to the Shanti Stupa we slept only to wake up to something more\
  \ exciting.\n\nI saw different bikes stationed outside our hotel. Yes, it was the\
  \ most awaited day for us to go the highest motor-able road- Khar Dung La pass.\
  \ \n\u201CDon\u2019t cross the speed limit\u201D, cautioned our tour guide and off\
  \ we were. Passing through heighted roads and relying on our camphor, we crossed\
  \ 40 km. There were people, people with different coloured flags, different cultures,\
  \ speaking different languages waving at us from above. We reached to see the amount\
  \ of victorious riders congratulating each other in Tamil, Hindi, Gujarati, Marwari,\
  \ Marathi and tons of other Indian languages. I got off the bike, standing at 18,000\
  \ feet, holding hands with the citizens. \n\nEnding our trip with good-byes and\
  \ memories, I came home only to believe in \u201CUnited we stand, and divided we\
  \ fall\u201D"
