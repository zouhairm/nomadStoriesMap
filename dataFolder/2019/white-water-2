Text: "Inhale... DUCK!\n\nI continuously battled to resurface up, as the stubborn\
  \ waves attacked one after the other -  each one horrifyingly more atrocious than\
  \ the previous.  My body is taking every smash like a punching bag, but I have to\
  \ maintain it balanced on the surfboard so I can propel my arms and paddle away\
  \ from the impact zone.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s never-ending!\u201D I gasped loudly back\
  \ at Jerome, hoping he could hear me from all the splashing.  Even in-between being\
  \ engulfed in the waves, I could hear his high-pitched laugh echoing across the\
  \ horizon. Such. A. Brat.  I knew what that meant, and he was right.\n\nWe arrived\
  \ mid-afternoon yesterday, despite leaving before dawn from Manila.  It was a crippling,\
  \ almost 300-km drive to get to Baler; and the roads aren\u2019t the best of conditions\
  \ either. The asphalted highway was replaced by unfinished paths and then cliffs,\
  \ where a 6-wheeler truck had already toppled over.\n\nBut in a few hours, I am\
  \ flying 10,000 kilometers back to the United Kingdom. I couldn\u2019t possibly\
  \ miss this annual trip with my siblings, the beach, surfing and of course the sun:\
  \ I needed to enjoy all these things I would be deprived of when I depart.\n\nThis\
  \ time my brother got in touch with one of his friends who knew one of Baler\u2019\
  s best surfers - who could teach us.  We dropped our bags at the small family-owned\
  \ hostel we used to stay at and rushed to the beach.  Expected to be taught by one\
  \ of the best, only to be disappointed, as he decided not to teach anyone but instead\
  \ recommended his friends.\n\n\u201CHow old are you?\u201D  I was curious of my\
  \ instructor.\n\n\u201CNineteen!\u201D  Jerome beamed with his naughty incisors.\
  \ \n\nHis age was practically plastered all over his forehead.  All the instructors\
  \ looked similar - their brawny but small frames, hair disheveled and beach tan.\
  \  But among all four, Jerome was the only one whose eyes would glisten with excitement\
  \ and laugh hysterically after I tumbled a few times in the beginning.  I had to\
  \ I recall how it was to balance on the surfboard again.  He bragged how he would\
  \ juggle working as a delivery boy and surfing as his leisure.  Somehow, he managed\
  \ to eventually see my triumphs of riding the waves and greeted them with squeals\
  \ and high-fives.\n\n\u201CWhen is the best time to catch the best waves?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\n\n\u201CThe gnarly comes at six o\u2019clock in the morning!\u201D his\
  \ voice crackled.\n\nHe must think this is all a joke. I am definitely not waking\
  \ up that early.\n\nInhale. Duck!\n\nI continuously battled to resurface up.\n\n\
  The water is glacial, but I closed my eyes as I received the embrace of the warm\
  \ sunshine.  The waves have finally calmed a bit now and I glided wholeheartedly\
  \ to what Jerome had called \u201Cwaves fit for a lady.\u201D  I road all the waves\
  \ as much as I could, occasionally filling my gut with salt water, but I rode them.\
  \  When my hour is up, I thanked him and went back to the shore still giddy from\
  \ the adrenaline and his boyish jokes.\n\nAll the other instructors went to eat\
  \ breakfast after that early start, but Jerome went back to the beach.  I watched\
  \ the kid play carelessly,  falling, chuckling. When thoughts of my imminent departure,\
  \ of being alone and away from home again tried to emerge, I closed my eyes shut\
  \ and listened to the swell flow back to the ocean."
