Text: "After a three-hour roadtrip coming from Montevideo in a bus full of agitaded\
  \ tourists from all over the world, we finally arrived to Colonia Del Sacramento,a\
  \ town in the countryside of Uruguay, and as soon as I jumped off of the bus, I\
  \ was already in love. \nAs the tour guide lead us further into the old streets\
  \ made of little Stones, i coudn\u2019t contain my excitement enough to listen to\
  \ most of the stories he was telling us about the city, I was already mesmerized\
  \ by every single corner, building and tree in front of me, as IF I had Just landed\
  \ in a completely new world and despite being a total stranger to that place it\
  \ felt Just like home to me.  The entire environment  had a very vibrant 18th century\
  \ energy that amused me and made me shiver to my bones, I was delighted to see how\
  \ History was written over every single  corner in my sight, turning it into a stunning\
  \ roofless museum  composed by various colonial style buildings and castles that\
  \ would make you feel like you\u2019re living in a fairytale. The church, however,\
  \ was definetely one of my favorite places, it fills me with joy and hope to see\
  \ that there are still places like that, so well-preserved and maintained, when\
  \ we are going through a time of such devaluation of History and it\u2019s monuments.\n\
  And the town continued to surprise as we went on with the trip. As we were walking\
  \ down the colorful streets we could take a glance at the variety of restaurants\
  \ and coffee shops ofered by Sacramento.  Also, it was pretty thrilling for me as\
  \ an art enthusiastic to see how the comunity embraces their artistic spirit, through\
  \ every part of the town we could find many craft shops and small handicraft fairs,\
  \ with a number of handmade products that would make any tourist lose their mind,\
  \ wondering which of the gorgeous souvenirs to take home to their family and friends.\n\
  It is unnecessary to say at this point how cozy and heartwarming I felt while visiting\
  \ Sacramento, the entire small-town vibe made me feel like a part of the comunity,\
  \ like I was already a member of the family. Above evertyhing else, the town is\
  \ an exemple of a balanced environment, where nature and human life live together\
  \ peacefully and mindful of each other. The comunity is a whole tribute to art and\
  \ history, enhancing the best side of humanity and everything it can offer. To this\
  \ day I am still honoured that I was able to live this experience and see such beauty\
  \ up close, I can\u2019t help but feel that there\u2019s a part of me that belongs\
  \ to that place and it left me wanting so much more that I came home already planning\
  \ my return."
