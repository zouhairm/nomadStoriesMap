Text: "Olive oil trickled from my lips as I nibbled on a fresh chunk of ciabatta bread.\
  \ I dipped again. Tracks of oil glistened off the corners of my lips as I smiled.\
  \ My classmates chattered around me as we enjoyed the rustic food. We are in Tarquinia,\
  \ Italy today. The class journeyed from a small town in Texas to Italy a few days\
  \ ago. The purpose of the course was to follow the footsteps of the Roman civilization.\
  \  It was my first time abroad and each day I experienced something new. \n\n  Tarquinia\
  \ looked like it could have been tucked away in a storybook. The Roman Pines lined\
  \ the edges of the plot and the air smelled untainted with gentle notes of oranges\
  \ from a nearby orchard. The professor, Dr. Cape, led the group and commentated\
  \ along the way. We stopped at an assuming plot of land. We squinted and looked\
  \ for signs of civilization. The class spent most of the trip in Rome, so we were\
  \ used to being dwarfed by magnificent ancient buildings. The professor told us\
  \ we were at an ancient Etruscan burial site. The Etruscans were a precursor to\
  \ the ancient Romans and lived along the Tiber river until 509 BC. They left behind\
  \ a wealth of artifacts that gave us clues with how they lied. The Etruscans also\
  \ left behind underground tombs.\n\n    I have a strange relationship with death.\
  \ I never knew how to deal with death and always avoided addressing it. My stomach\
  \ turned as I thought about what was hidden within the tombs. Were there ghosts?\
  \ Mummified bodies that may come to life? Will there be spiderwebs and an ominous\
  \ unexplained dripping sound within? The 20 burial markers scattered across the\
  \ plot made me feel uneasy. Tentatively, I walked towards a burial marker. At the\
  \ entrance there was a small description and a staircase that led to the underground\
  \ tombs. I looked around and saw my classmates reach a burial marker and then walk\
  \ downwards as if they were swallowed by the ground. There was a steep staircase\
  \ that was underground and led to the tomb. The path was dimly lit and there was\
  \ a small room at the bottom that was encased in glass. My heart raced as I sunk\
  \ lower and lower into the ground. The tomb was dark and waiting to be lit. A button\
  \ beckoned me to press it so the lights would turn on. I pressed it. \n\n   A gentle\
  \ light lit up the small tomb. There were colorful frescos on every side of the\
  \ wall. Happiness and joy echoed within motifs of parading women, animals, and feasts\
  \ lined the wall. The figures were dancing, feasting, and rivers of wine overflowed\
  \ their cups. The frescos revealed reclining couples and animals floating above\
  \ them. There were botanical motifs decorating the walls. Flora and fauna intertwined\
  \ and surrounded the reclining couple. I expected to walk into a grim tomb that\
  \ reeked of death, but instead stumbled into tombs that celebrated life. \n\n  \
  \ The uneasiness I initially felt waned and I was intrigued. Surely not every tomb\
  \ was this festive? I climbed the steep staircase back up and set off to another\
  \ burial marker. Tomb after tomb, it became clear that the Etruscans treated the\
  \ burials as a celebration of life. There were paintings of leopards, birds, and\
  \ other fauna intermingling with people on the walls. Some frescos even had a painted\
  \ door, which historians speculate represents a doorway to the next life. The tombs\
  \ embrace and welcome death with scenes of musicians, dancers, and pets. \n  \n\
  \ My fear slipped away and I found myself speechless at the bottom of a dark staircase.\
  \ I am grateful that the Etruscans left behind these beautifully decorated tombs.\
  \ Each tomb provided clues about how the Etruscans lived. They lived vicariously\
  \ and savored life. They continued to enjoy life unwaveringly, even after death.\
  \ I pressed the button to light the tomb one more time. The lights stayed on for\
  \ several more moments and turned off. I was engulfed in the darkness again, but\
  \ this time, I wasn\u2019t afraid. I turned around and followed the sunlight at\
  \ the top of the staircase and made my way to the next tomb."
