Text: "Incredible India.India is a very different and  multifaceted country. I am\
  \ in India for the third time and all three times are very different from each other.\
  \ India is the country of my childhood dream! I could not imagine that I would be\
  \ so lucky to know all the expanses and latitudes of India so soon. Most likely\
  \ I will begin my story with my first visit to India. \n   Summer 2017.08.11 this\
  \ day I will never forget! On this day I went beyond the horizons of my country\
  \ for the first time,it was my first push. For the first time in my life, I go outside\
  \ my country and fly to the country of my dreams. I thought I am the luckiest person\
  \ in the world. And finally I'm in India, Delhi. Delhi international airport seemed\
  \ so huge to me that I never understood where the beginning and where the end. Even\
  \ got lost at the airport, and with the Luggage there were difficulties, we just\
  \ did not know where to go and where to get the Luggage. We sorted out the Luggage,\
  \ found a way out and left the airport. Outside was hot, so hot that sweat was pouring\
  \ out of you like water from a bucket.  A lot of people,the cars,the noise,the crowd,\
  \ at that moment  I just started to watch everything going on nearby, and it was\
  \ all near the airport. We were met at the airport, we got into the car and drove\
  \ off towards the hotel. On the way to the hotel, I looked at everything and everyone.\
  \ We drove for a long time to the hotel and on the way met very different places\
  \ and people.\n   So we reached the hotel, entered the inside of the hotel. There\
  \ were two of us from the same country and one spare room. We were told to live\
  \ in one room until the second room was vacated. As soon as the room is free one\
  \ of us will move. We agreed because we had no other choice. Suddenly after a couple\
  \ of hours, someone had checked out. I was moved separately and our life in India\
  \ began. We went out to meet the guys and found girls from our country, and  many\
  \ other students from other  countries of the world. We were very happy to meet\
  \ them. Began to communicate, get acquainted with each other. It's time to eat and\
  \ we did not take anything from home. I didn't even think about it, we need to take\
  \ food with us from home.(pasta, cookies,etc.) We ordered food at the hotel, asked\
  \ to make not spicy. Went down to eat, the food was very spicy and a lot, a lot\
  \ of spices, a variety of spices and seasonings. Food was impossible to eat. A girl\
  \ from our country came down to us and she began to tell us and guide us. \n   Then\
  \ we went to buy fruits, dairy products and other necessary accessories. When we\
  \ left the hotel it was very hot,noisy, a lot of cars and some not familiar smell\
  \ in the air. You start sweating instantly. Everything was very unfamiliar, strange\
  \ and alien. There were problems with the English language among this people is\
  \ completely different pronunciation and accent but then I used to. Gradually we\
  \ began to get used to everything but not to spicy food. Began to visit and a place\
  \ with European cuisine. Delhi is a beautiful city, many kinds of places such as:\
  \ Kutub Minar, Lotus temple, India Gate and many many other beautiful places,but\
  \ you have to come and see. Visited other places, such as Rishikesh, Haridwar, Mathura,Noida,\
  \ etc. All these places fascinate with its beauty and history, each story is interesting\
  \ and monotonous. With people whom I finished the course in Delhi I have the most\
  \ indescribable and most vivid emotions and impressions. \n   Again I'm  here,I\
  \ am in India, a new state, a new city, new people,new acquaintances and new experience.\n\
  \   Of course there are difficulties, I always try to find more positive even in\
  \ such situations of my life. It was a brief description of my first visit to Incredible\
  \ India and my first impressions and discoveries about Incredible India."
