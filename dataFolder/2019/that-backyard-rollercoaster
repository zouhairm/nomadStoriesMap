Text: "THAT BACKYARD ROLLERCOASTER\n\n\nWell, I guess life is like a giant puzzle,\
  \ pieces connect when you least expect and adventures take place along the way...\n\
  \n- November, 2015, Brazil\n\nI was reading a book called: All the Bright Places\
  \ by Jennifer Niven. The author takes us in a journey through unique and different\
  \ places in Indiana, USA. I\u2019d think to myself that one day I\u2019d drive around\
  \ that state and visit all those places... Well, that\u2019s where my journey started\
  \ and I had no idea what the future would bring. \n\n- May, 2018, Illinois, USA\n\
  \nI was doing a cultural exchange program in America and I wanted to have a little\
  \ break from Illinois\u2014 the state I was living at that time. I wanted something\
  \ cheap and near by, so I started googling only to find one called Indiana, that\
  \ was only 4 hours away. It didn\u2019t take long for me to remember the book I\u2019\
  ve read in Brazil and so, I got the list of places from it and suddenly I had a\
  \ hotel booked, a car rented and a to go travel itinerary without any effort.\n\n\
  I still needed one thing though \u2014 a travel buddy \u2014 and I knew just the\
  \ right person!\nThe phone rang, she answered, I told my plans and as fast as a\
  \ racing car she was in!\n\nHer name is Amanda and I met her in Brazil\u2014 our\
  \ home country. We were both waiting in line for our visa interview, we got along\
  \ quite well and made plans to meet abroad. We were both traveling to America, though\
  \ we would be living in different states.\n\n- June, 9, 2018, Indiana, USA\n\nWe\
  \ woke up early to go to the first of many \n bright places we were going to visit.\
  \ Off we went to meet the Ivers and their creation.\n\nJohn is this super duper\
  \ awesome senior guy and his wife was so sweet, they welcomed me and Amanda to their\
  \ home with such kindeness.\n\nJohn is a very creative guy and many years ago he\
  \ was in his backyard when he looked to his wife and said: I\u2019m gonna build\
  \ a rollercoaster here, so our children can have something really fun to play with.\
  \ I think she must have laughed and thought he was crazy.\n\nThey said he tried\
  \ to ride many times, he literally put himself in danger to make sure it was safe\
  \ for his children. He is no engineer and it\u2019s pretty amazing all the work\
  \ he did.\n\nWe had an awesome time talking, but it was time for us to face our\
  \ fears and ride the \u201CBlue Flash\u201D coaster. To be honest we didn\u2019\
  t lack fear, the coaster looked pretty sketchy and the only thing holding you was\
  \ a kind of abdominal safety bell.\n\n I was the first one to ride, and fear was\
  \ all running through my veins, but oh man, that\u2019s was one of the most thrilling\
  \ things I\u2019ve ever done. \nAmanda was even more scared, but she rode too.\n\
  \nWe knew that backyard rollercoast was a huge leap into the unknown\u2014 we had\
  \ to trust our lives to a guy we\u2019ve just met, we had to trust that Blue Flash\
  \ would take us from beginning to end in safety, but we made it and how much fun\
  \ we had.\n\nThey say that what really matters is the in between \u2014 the journey\
  \ \u2014 not the departures or arrivals. I couldn\u2019t agree more, because those\
  \ little moments, those valuable memories are what makes life so precious and help\
  \ building who we are.\n\nThe rest of our road trip was awesome, but without any\
  \ doubts that unknown backyard gave us the best adventure!"
