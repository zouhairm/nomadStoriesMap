Text: "Tokyo. The land of the rising sun, or on this occasion, the land of the typhoon.\n\
  \nI wake to the bleating of my alarm, taking only seconds to spring into consciousness.\
  \ Today is the day! Weeks of anticipation have led to this moment. I pull back the\
  \ blinds of our eleventh story apartment and my heart sinks. Rain is pouring down\
  \ over the rooftops of Shinjuku. The skies are grey and foreboding, Typhoon Malakas\
  \ has arrived.\n\n Disappointed but not deterred, we are soon on the early morning\
  \ train heading to Mayhama. The train pulls into the station to the familiar jingle\
  \ of \u2019It\u2019s a small world\u2019. I take a deep breath and smile. We\u2019\
  re here! After 10 long years, I have returned to my place of dreams. Will it be\
  \ the same? Will this day be everything that I\u2019d hoped it would be?\n\n As\
  \ we make our way across the wet and deserted entrance, I peer at my husband, his\
  \ head hung low as the rain whips at his face, he doesn\u2019t seem convinced.\n\
  \n\u2018Welcome to Tokyo Disney Sea\u2019 blurts a cheerful voiceover as we pass\
  \ through the giant ornate Italian archway. Suddenly we\u2019re transported to Venice,\
  \ with colourful painted shops, gondolas and an impressively large mediterranean\
  \ harbour. A crew member stands dutifully in the rain, waving ecstatically, seemingly\
  \ unperturbed by the downpour. All thoughts of the weather quickly dissipate as\
  \ we step into this magical world.\n\n Wearing our matching Mickey and Minnie ponchos,\
  \ we set off to explore, skipping gleefully between one attraction to the next.\
  \ Our shoes are soaked through, our umbrellas destroyed by one gust of wind, but\
  \ our spirits are free and somehow we don\u2019t care.\n\n We queue for a ride,\
  \ which seems to be designed , unbeknownst to us, for children. As we cram into\
  \ the tiny seats, we notice that the ride is entirely occupied by adults. As the\
  \ roller coaster takes off, our carefully buttoned up hoods fly off our faces in\
  \ the wind. The rain is pelting us like bullets, but we are all laughing, completely\
  \ free and uninhibited. Once the carriage comes to a halt, we notice that every\
  \ adult is beaming from ear to ear. Typhoon Malakas isn\u2019t stopping us! We are\
  \ having the time of our life.\n\n Later, as we make our way back to our hotel,\
  \ I glance at my husband once more. His expression is perplexing to me, it is almost\
  \ that of pure elation. His eyes sparkling and full of childlike joy. As my brand\
  \ new shoes squelch with each footstep, I ask him if he had fun. He says nothing\
  \ back, but grins\u2026."
