Text: 'When you find yourself in the middle of a storm, in the dark blue of the Indian
  Ocean, on a little wooden red boat whose motor is on fire, surrounded by praying
  men, you start thinking why you had to choose Indonesia for your travel. Not Bali
  or Java, but a little unknown archipelago near Sulawesi, the wildest and less touristic
  place of the Country, that even google maps cannot find. Such a great idea to live
  with the fishermen like a modern Malinowski, on islands with no signal and, above
  all, during the rainy season. Rainy season means few connections with the mainland
  (only the bravest sailors set sail), scarcity of food and water on the islands and
  high chances to get caught by a storm during a trip, maybe while you are trying
  to go back to the big city, Makassar. It is more an adventure than a trip, the kind
  of adventure that obliges you to make a clear decision: to give up with your modern
  and riskful explorer''s life or to hold on tight. An adventure which requires you
  to stay strong in front of a storm or a mosquitos'' bite, while your just-met friend
  is in a (quite bad) hospital with the dengue. This kind of travel teaches you a
  couple of things: for example, that you have to be prepared to give up things you
  have taken for granted for a long time (from tap water to electricity), or that
  nature can be really dangerous, even if you swim damn well.

  But above all, that you will never find a life jacket on an Indonesian boat, so
  buy one yourself.'
