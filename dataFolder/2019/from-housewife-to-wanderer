  \ call me Ms/Mrs. Levina. I am a housewife and a teacher. \n\ni love writing. in\
  \ the turmoil of my heart I want it to feel like I have to jump somewhere place\
  \ to take my time to write something that can bring inspiration and the desire of\
  \ someone who just enjoys being or living. it does not mean that I do not live with\
  \ the heart of what I am living right now but my love in writing and traveling when\
  \ I jump at one time I want to make a separate story that I want to share with everyone.\
  \ \n\nThe dream that I felt was still hidden deep down was a bit risky if it was\
  \ said that without real evidence in front of me, I hoped that I would get a golden\
  \ opportunity to be able to jump to a place where the field of knowledge and shared\
  \ learning opportunities were worshiped in the form of stories the journey of love\
  \ will be beautiful in the next steps.\n\nhopefully with me being able to join Travel\
  \ Writing Scholarship 2019 to Portugal together will make it real."
