Text: 'It was five years ago that i embarked upon my second  foreign trip to Bonn
  where i stayed for three months as part of my fellowship at the Urdu service of
  DW.  I will always remember the visit for  so many reasons. Firstly and definitely
  because  it was fully of learning  trip where i learnt a lot from my peers at the
  DW about the contemporary trends in the field of Journalism.  And secondly because
  i was not expecting Bonn will be such a relaxed  and laid back place, and every
  thing is so accessible and definitely i was not expecting such a good integrated
  transport system. There''s also a lot of countryside around Bonn. It''s based on
  the Rhine, with the city on one side, and mountains and hills on the other. In fact
  there were so many things that surprised me.  In fact i explored  the entire city
  from  its sex shops to the mosques. I really discovered the opera here in Bonn.
  The last thing I saw was The Marriage of Figaro. The Bonn Haus der Geschichte is
  the best museum in the city. It is packed with information and material about modern
  German history since the Second World War: it is very informative and has lots of
  interesting display items, like video clips and newspaper cuttings. For me, though,
  the real highlight of the city has to be the Rhine itself, it''s just really beautiful.
  In the nutshell, i will always cherish my visit to Bonn and would  like  to visit
  the city again to exploit what i could not explored in the last visit.'
