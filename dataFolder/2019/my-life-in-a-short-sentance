Text: I Was born on the 17/12/1958 in Govan Glasgow from Irish Parents, My Mum & Dad
  Came Home to look after his Dads Farm, where I Helped out for years, then after
  trying to work in local factories an Oil Company Came to Glangevlin exploring for
  Gas so I though Id try it & got started straight away, but had to go to Larne where
  Kenting Drilling was  taking in a new Platform to drill for Geothermal Wells,  I
  stayed with them for years & traveled all over Europe & sent cash Back to Mum &
  Dad. It was when we were drilling in Yorkshire that I meet my "Yorkshire Rose" Jeanette,
  and we got married, I then got a new job with KCAD working Abroad in Switzerland
  & Dubai & I always called home to my Rose, But when I called home once she said
  she had "Good News" for me?. After much to & Frowning  she said she was Pregnant,
  which was a total surprise to me as I was 100% sure I was "Firing Blanks", So I
  said was she Sure & again the reply was "Ill Show U when U come Thursday. So to
  Surprise her I came home 2 days early on a Tuesday, I got to my hose in Otley &
  no Car outside so I thought shed be Working in her Bar Job. I went to the toilet
  & washed my hands & Flushed it, then the door bell Rang, & it was my Good friends
  Wife Allison, she came in & I said I was going to check if Id Flushed the Toilet,
  When I heard her what I thought was "Are U Going to Bed", to which I replied "NO"
  I'm going to check if I've Flushed the Toilet as I was in it when U wrung my door
  bell. Then I checked the toilet & as it was Flushed I Flushed it again so she could
  hear the sound, I then came down & She said to me "Why Did I not Want to go to Bed
  with Her", which Surprised me & I said this " Allison I Have Border Lines with My
  Friends Wives & this is not a Line I was Willing to Cross. She then said "Where
  do U think Ur wife is & with Who?. I said I'm sure she at work in the crown & on
  her own. She said Lets go and see, so she Brought me to the rose& Crown & told me
  to go in First, Which I did & on the righthand Side was my Wife & My Best Friend
  Andrew ( Allison Husband.) & his hands were on her Knee's until he saw me & Quickly
  came off., She then came over to me & said why was I Home Early to which I replied
  to "Surprise U" but looking at this its me that has got the surprise. We had Lots
  of Discussions, but to cut a long story short I Left the next day & Requested a
  divorce. I Truly Loved her but my friend Abused my trust.      ?????????????????????
