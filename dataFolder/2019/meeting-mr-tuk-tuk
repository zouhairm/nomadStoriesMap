Text: "Let\u2019s get the bus and go somewhere new! Clairebear, my dear friend had\
  \ said the night before. Claire wanted to go somewhere off the beaten track and\
  \ had heard of a hidden gem along the Chindwin river. The next day we were on a\
  \ local bus on our way to Monywa. \n\nThat day we travelled for many hours till\
  \ we arrived at the bus park. It was full of people coming and going.  Some however\
  \ were waiting eagerly for what the day could bring and by the looks we received\
  \ stepping off the bus I don\u2019t believe it was us. I remember faces filled with\
  \ smiles and overwhelming amounts of arms pointing at a range of vehicles including\
  \ motorbikes, tuk tuks and trucks.  \n\nIn typical friendly Burmese fashion it was\
  \ not long before we had many gestures of help, however one man stood out. He was\
  \ small and unassuming. He had an inviting face and rushed up to us saying \u201C\
  hello\u201D and \u201Ccome\u201D. He had his phone on him and showed us some photos\
  \ of foreigners he had previously taken places. He also had a few text messages\
  \ translated into English offering his local guide service. With both our small\
  \ amount of Burmese and his small amount of English we decided this was a perfect\
  \ match. We jumped in the back of his bicycle driven tuk tuk. \n\nThis was Mr Tuk\
  \ Tuk and he was going to show us some accommodation options for the night. We settled\
  \ on the second place he took us. I had a big backpack and didn\u2019t want to exhaust\
  \ him any further.  After a second showing of Mr Tuk Tuk\u2019s photo gallery we\
  \ gratefully agreed that Mr Tuk Tuk would return in the morning to take us on an\
  \ adventure to Phowintaung. We would later know it as the Pho Win Hill. We all agreed\
  \ on a time and off Mr Tuk Tuk went. \n\nBright and early the next morning Mr Tuk\
  \ Tuk was waiting. This time to our relief he arrived in his motorbike tuk tuk.\
  \ Mr Tuk Tuk drove us out of the city and into the open highways. There was little\
  \ traffic, apart from the occasional motorbike or mining truck. We passed a large\
  \ mine on our way and Mr Tuk Tuk advised us that it was the Chinese mining copper.\
  \ \n\nWe arrived at Pho Win Hill two hours later with a very exhausted motor that\
  \ needed a rest. It almost didn\u2019t make it up the hill. We passed many empty\
  \ shops and cafes on our way up. As I stood at the top of the hill the pagoda tops\
  \ popped out of the landscape like ice cream cones, inviting us to explore higher\
  \ and come closer. \n\nWe followed Mr Tuk Tuk and then he followed us, keeping his\
  \ distance and offering gestures of guidance when we looked uncertain. We went up\
  \ and down, round corners and down alleyways. It was like navigating a maze as a\
  \ child, not knowing what way to turn but exhilarated by the prospect of discovering\
  \ something new. The jungle crept in where ever it could and from the outside we\
  \ could have been walking in the mountains along some rocky edges. \n\nOnce we entered\
  \ the door like cave entrances and peeked through the little holes in the rock face\
  \ a whole other world welcomed us in. There were over 900 Buddhist statues in total.\
  \ Faded and perfected formed painting depicted on the walls. The figures ranged\
  \ in size, and were depicted telling different stories. Some were older than others\
  \ dating back to the 14th century but all magically mesmerising. \n\nAlthough we\
  \ had learnt little facts about this place we had learnt that was not what coming\
  \ here was about. This was a place where you felt its importance; it\u2019s history\
  \ and seeing it was the greatest gift Mr Tuk Tuk had given us. We finished that\
  \ day off with Mr Tuk Tuk taking a photo of the two of us in front of one of the\
  \ cave entrances. We wanted to be a part of his story because he had so importantly\
  \ been a part of ours."
