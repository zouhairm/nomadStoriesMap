Text: 'The more you travel, the more you learn.

  When you travel one country and then travel to another, you put into practice what
  you left behind, like when you scale at a professional level.

  The essence of who we are are the steps we have taken throughout our years.

  With cities happens a little bit the same thing.

  When you enter a city with a lot of history, you discover what was behind those
  new walls recently painted, that plug the ruts that the years have been leaving,
  like the wrinkles of an old woman sitting in the doorway of her house selling handmade
  things. Each crack each wrinkle represents a story.

  In my travels I love to look at the streets and stay dreaming of what happened,
  I imagine through the stories I hear from the local people.

  Many times we do not realize it but when we travel we learn many things and one
  of them for me is to be a better person.

  When you find a place in cities or villages with low resources, hospitable locals
  and invite you to they home, they put a plate of food, without caring if they can
  afford it, teach us grateful.

  They teach us what was their country or culture or daily life , they show us their
  kind side, and for me that is a good trip.

  Culture is not the historical part of monuments it is everything that composes it
  from a plate of food to a bullet hole.'
