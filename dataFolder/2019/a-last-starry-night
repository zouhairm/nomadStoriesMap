Text: "There are two starry nights which brought tears to my eyes, midnights at the\
  \ Saharan desert and   inside the jungle in Costa Rica. When I left my home for\
  \ the first time, certainly I was not expecting to find a family far from home,\
  \ but something that never crossed my head, was that I almost took my own life in\
  \ the middle of a starry night in the jungle. \nOne month far away from everything,\
  \ on a country not so far from home, was a good start from someone who has never\
  \ left the country before. Of course, I felt the latino welcoming, but I knew I\
  \ wasn\u2019t home, until I left. You are bound to the land where you were born\
  \ and raised, but each time we travel we left a little of us there, as much as we\
  \ take from that land that received us. But I almost left my own life in a cliff\
  \ facing the Caribbean.\nA Portuguese, a Brazilian and a Slovak and myself. We were\
  \ headed to Puerto Viejo; however our destiny was far from one of the most visited\
  \ beaches in the country. Our destiny was 24 kilometres from the small village.\
  \ The way there is only through a narrow and tricky highway that goes up and down,\
  \ between hills and crossing rivers. No cars, just bikes.\nThe small village of\
  \ Puerto Viejo is basically composed by two long streets where the inhabitants work\
  \ in tourist traps. If you go further where they do eat (and live), you will be\
  \ able to experience vibrant an afrocaribbean oasis. Sweet coconut rice & beans\
  \ with tender fish fillet at the beach with the fresh breeze of the Caribbean against\
  \ the rocks is just \u201CPura vida\u201D. \nWe took the road with the bikes, we\
  \ visited small pristine beaches at the edge of the highway and kept going.  I was\
  \ always behind the rest of the group no matter how much I tried. Little did I knew\
  \ that the bike was as old as myself (about 20 years by now) and the tires as flat\
  \ as deep ends of the small hills and cliffs we were crossing. Despite the strenuous\
  \ way, the sights were astonishing. The virgin jungle and the Caribbean aside was\
  \ a perfect combination. Birds chirping, monkeys howling and the sea roaring, with\
  \ the fresh scent of the blooming flowers and fruit trees growing freely, it was\
  \ pure paradise.  Still fresh on my memory because when you remember, you live it\
  \ all over again. \nSoon, we peaked the highest cliff that faces the Caribbean,\
  \ more than 20 meters tall, whilst taller waves crashed against the place that we\
  \ were standing. As horizon turns red, we took the road again. And then the problem\
  \ started. Soon it became dark. An old Mexican saying goes \u201Cas black as a wolf\u2019\
  s mouth\u201D. But we needed to keep going, since a light rain started pouring.\n\
  It did not last long. The rain was over soon, and the sky soon became clear as before.\
  \ Our path became guarded by the millions of stars naked on a perfectly dark land\
  \ which did not blinded our guardians. And as dark as a wolf\u2019s mouth, we kept\
  \ it going. But being as the left behind of the group I was struggling to keep the\
  \ pace. But now when I reached the peak of a tall hill, they were at the bottom\
  \ facing a small bridge waiting for me. So, I threw myself in that old bike, and\
  \ soon I noticed that I couldn\u2019t control the speed. That small bridge had a\
  \ small space that went directly down to a running river. I was unstoppable. Went\
  \ straight into the jungle or falling into the river? When I was close to the edge\
  \ of falling, I turned my handle violently, passed over a dirty shovel and sweep\
  \ until half of the bike was hanging into the abyss. I almost fell. I look up to\
  \ the sky, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. My friends were shocked when I told them\
  \ that we should keep going. Adrenaline running and a violent heartbeat as we kept\
  \ going, under that perfect starred night."
