Text: 'I did not expect to find such warm welcome during my official tour to another
  province of my country. Before leaving to Peshawar i was very concious and instructed
  from my family and colleagues that Peshawar is not a safe place for a girl to travel
  alone, i should be very careful and keep them informed regarding my every movement
  there.

  While starting my journey i covered myself properly and said alot of prayers to
  get back to my province safely.

  I saw many unknown faces at the terminal in peshawar but that was a usual thing
  for me as i use to travel alot during my job, but this time it was feeling a little
  different.

  I noticed that men around me were also a little consious that a girl was walking
  alone which added to my concerns.

  Suddenly i realized that a man was standing on the side to allow me to walk outside
  the door first, this was rather a pleasant experience and i do felt happy by his
  positive gesture.

  I started my official meetings and again i was surprised by the a personal secretary
  who allowed me to meet the Minister without any appointment just because i was a
  girl and a guest to their province.

  Things were easier to me as i was given respect by everyone, it started to change
  my narrative and i realized that how our misconceptions grow with us and we start
  believing them without any authentic prove.

  I told these stories to everyone back at Punjab in my circle that there is a very
  condusive atmosphere at Peshawar for girls and most of our misconceptions like narrow
  mindedness or conservatives of Pathans regarding girls is misleading and needs to
  be overcome.'
