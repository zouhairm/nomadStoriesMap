Text: "Whenever I visit a new city, I like to walk the streets and watch life happen.\
  \ The streets are a fascinating spectacle. If you are patient enough, they will\
  \ reveal top secrets to you. Things known only to the locals.\n\nAnd so I always\
  \ walk and spend most of my time outside.\n\nThe weather is very much a part of\
  \ street life. It can change the way you feel. It can change the way you perceive\
  \ things.\n\nWhen I was in Amsterdam last week, it rained. It was foggy and Amsterdam\
  \ looked nothing like the city promoted on colourful postcards outside souvenir\
  \ shops. Everything was monochromatic \u2013 the canals, the buildings, the sky,\
  \ the people. All of it blended into one single colour.\n\nIt was difficult to take\
  \ pictures. I made a few unsuccessful attempts to balance my umbrella with my chin.\
  \ All of this while trying to keep my lens clear of rain drops.\n\nImpossible.\n\
  \nBy lunchtime I felt defeated. Defeated by the streets I loved so much. I still\
  \ had nine hours left till my flight and wondered if I should visit a museum instead.\
  \ Indecisive, I made one last round along the canal. There I spotted a charming\
  \ bike. It was leaning against a stylish lamp pole and looked beautiful.\n\nI forced\
  \ the umbrella shaft under my chin again and focused on the bike in the viewfinder.\
  \ The background was cluttered with two bikes which had fallen over. Only when I\
  \ tried to recompose my shot did I notice a message on the electricity box next\
  \ to them.\n\n\"The emotions of the street are something museums can't buy,\" it\
  \ said.\n\nI almost could not believe my eyes.\n\nThe streets of Amsterdam were\
  \ telling me to stay and give the city one more chance. \n\nI smiled and obeyed.\n\
  \nI pointed my camera on the bike again. I tried to recompose my shot, but the two\
  \ bikes in the background were still there. After a short moment I found myself\
  \ picking them up and moving them to the side. As I walked back to the spot from\
  \ where I took my first shot, I realised I had had a coffee shop right behind my\
  \ back all this time. There were people sitting in the window. It was the type of\
  \ a caf\xE9 with long tables along the windows which invite you to watch street\
  \ life unfold right in front of you. As you sip your hot drink and ponder. \n\n\
  I was not sure what I would think if I was one of them. If I saw somebody doing\
  \ what I had been performing there \u2013 squatting, standing up, moving one step\
  \ right, jumping one step back, pulling the bikes up, pushing them to the side,\
  \ pushing them a bit more... They must have thought I was crazy. \nWhen you watch\
  \ people in the street, you may not always understand what they do or why. The street\
  \ can make you wonder. It can make you laugh. It can make you cry. And it can provide\
  \ answers.\n\nJust like the message I received one rainy day in Amsterdam. I could\
  \ have easily missed it if I wouldn't have focused on the beauty of the street.\n\
  \nAnd so I ended up spending the entire Saturday outside, walking the rainy and\
  \ foggy streets of Amsterdam. \n\n\"Did you eat a lot of gouda?\" One of my friends\
  \ asked when I got back home.\n\n\"Ehm, no,\" was my answer.\n\nA moment of surprise.\
  \ Who goes to the Netherlands and does not get at least a bite of gouda?\n\nAnother\
  \ one tried, hoping there would be more to talk about:\n\n\"Did you visit any museums?\"\
  \n\"Actually no,\" I confessed.\n\nA moment of laughter. Nobody dared to ask another\
  \ \"Did you?\" question and for a while I felt like I did not do a good job being\
  \ a tourist.\n\nBut maybe it's just that we all experience travel differently. We\
  \ grasp reality through different senses. Some of us need to taste. Some of us need\
  \ to touch.\n\nI need to see.\n\nI need to watch life unfold right in the middle\
  \ of the street.\n\nWhoever wrote it was right: \"The emotions of the street are\
  \ something museums can't buy.\""
