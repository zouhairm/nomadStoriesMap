Text: "In 2014 I walked the Camino Frances to Santiago with a double intention pledged\
  \ to the road I was taking. Walking the way for me wasn\u2019t logical, I didn\u2019\
  t train, practise my hiking, or even talk about it beforehand. I wanted to make\
  \ a pilgrimage. \n\nI learnt that my intentions would be committed to a distance\
  \ way beyond the length of that path. \n\nI learnt that friendships made on the\
  \ road could be for a moment or endure into my present tense. I learnt that people\
  \ come and go.\n\nI learnt at my weakest point to be the subject of compassion as\
  \ a beggar offered me windfall plums stretched out on a leaf.\n\nI learnt I could\
  \ endure through heat and rain like a well-weathered piece of driftwood washed in\
  \ and washed out with the tide. \n\nI learnt that all journeys begin with small\
  \ steps taken alone, that the month-long walk was like a miniature of life\u2019\
  s longer trajectory.\n\nI met characters familiar to me. The people I encountered\
  \ held mirrors to the invisible ones at my side on the journey.\n\nI learnt to trust\
  \ myself, a lesson I would later forgetfully unlearn in doubt and fear. \n\nI learnt\
  \ that communication lies at a seabed deeper than speech. Across chaotic stagings\
  \ of four languages, even straying into the rocky terrain of semi-signed Italian,\
  \ I walked most often in silence.\n\nI learnt to keep on walking whatever the weather,\
  \ through valleys of white cows delicately carrying their bells, winelands so hot\
  \ they drained me of blood, ghost tundra villages guarded by lizards, and up and\
  \ out into the dense green embrace of Galicia. \n\nI intended to leave my voice\
  \ behind me, but it came with me like an uninvited guest. I was glad of it, singing\
  \ as I walked: to make the journey shorter, make a prayer of thought, whenever I\
  \ was asked, often when I was alone.\n\nI learnt fear, lying on the ground in a\
  \ flat and deserted country, waiting for the thunderstorm to pass over me.\n\nI\
  \ learnt betrayal, leafing through the missing places in my wallet where my money\
  \ had been.\n\nI learnt awe, staring at the ancient tombs of kings, and felt unexamined\
  \ social shame at other graves defaced during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nWhy travel?\
  \ The inner and the outer journey, every moment of braveness demanding a leap into\
  \ the unknown. I remember trying to conquer my fear of heights by jumping onto ever-moving\
  \ mountain gondolas in Austria. The illogical idea that I would be left hanging\
  \ suspended in conflict with the outcome of having made the leap as the gondola\
  \ ascended. \n\nMy first Camino was not what I expected. I had not in fact known\
  \ what to expect, did not want to know beforehand, and knew that nobody could tell\
  \ me what would happen in advance of the event. I was afraid, but didn\u2019t need\
  \ to be. I got injured and sick, I fell, I was lost, I cried, I met some crazy,\
  \ or even nasty people, but I survived, and had an adventure worthy of amazement.\n\
  \nAnd alongside the night terrors which came to pass, I filled my eyes and heart\
  \ with so much joy, and met good people who bandaged my wounds and listened to my\
  \ story. I experienced a richness of culture and heritage in Spain that astounded\
  \ me. I gained the desire to learn Spanish and to return and help others who walked\
  \ that path, volunteering on the Camino Nord as a hospitalera in 2016. The Spanish\
  \ is still a work in progress, but I am singing in the language and learning.\n\n\
  If anything, walking the Camino Frances gave me a stronger desire for adventure.\
  \ I am happy to look back at that younger version of myself, who walked without\
  \ knowing where she was going, content to learn the hard way what would come to\
  \ pass. I am pleased that I did not know what lay on the other side of that Camino."
