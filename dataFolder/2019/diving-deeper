Text: "The tiny island of San Pedro lies a couple miles off the Belize mainland; it\u2019\
  s lined by a cobalt blue ocean laced at the edges with white coral reefs. Belize\
  \ boasts the world\u2019s second largest barrier reef, so in 2017, I journeyed from\
  \ home, the deep cold of North Dakota, to dive off the shallow sand of Belize. \n\
  Scuba diving is the main tourist draw, and the best way to explore the rich waters\
  \ of San Pedro is through a seasoned dive master, who acts as the link between the\
  \ visitors and the diverse, thriving reef. Diving brought me to Belize, but my true\
  \ connection was through a kindred spirit. \nInhale. I can taste the air- dry with\
  \ an aftertaste of metal. I thread through the yellow maze of coral ridges until\
  \ I reach a dead end. Exhale. My bubbles weave a path toward the surface. A miniature\
  \ perfectly painted fish chooses its own route around the coral. I blast air into\
  \ my diving vest and let myself float up the invisible waves. Suddenly, my view\u2019\
  s flooded with every color imaginable--tangerine, liliac, chartreuse. My guide,\
  \ Gio, gestures for me to follow him through a tunnel, I kick to catch up as the\
  \ coral closes around me. The groups of surrounding fish clump together based on\
  \ similarities- like people do. We follow them deeper into the ocean.\nThis particular\
  \ day, my excitement mounts on the five minute boat ride out to our dive site. \u201C\
  Welcome to Esmeralda Canyons,\u201D Gio says. His tattooed arms motion to a radius\
  \ of water around us. The other divers on the boat seem unphased, while I\u2019\
  m leaning precariously off the boat trying to see something. I don\u2019t. Gio\u2019\
  s hand helps me shuffle to the edge of the boat. He gives me rushed instructions\
  \ and I nod as I re-adjust my equipment then check my air supply. Inhale. And fall\
  \ backwards off the boat. \nSafe, comfortable water catches me as I fall. As my\
  \ view shifts underwater, I concentrate on not holding my breath. Exhale. The distant\
  \ image of San Pedro, Belize and the rocking boat on the water\u2019s surface become\
  \ distorted. \nDeep in the seamless blue, Gio\u2019s awkward stance on land transforms\
  \ into grace. He\u2019s in his element. He knows exactly where to look: this crack\
  \ to find a camouflaged lobster. And he knows the things to stay away from: that\
  \ cave where the fluorescent green moray eel waits for unexpecting fingers. \nI\
  \ can see his all knowing brown eyes through his mask, happiness creasing the sides.\
  \ We form an unspoken bond as Gio teaches me to play. He shows me how to make rings\
  \ by putting my knuckles together in the cloud of bubbles and flicking outward to\
  \ propel the bubbles into a floating circle. Water is my element too. I study Gio\
  \ alongside the nearby creatures, the black wetsuit traces the muscular curves of\
  \ his body as he floats effortlessly.  Even the stingrays seem to follow him, sensing\
  \ his ease. \nGio\u2019s passionate love of life isn\u2019t obtainable above water.\
  \ The rest of us struggle to leave the world behind us. But when Gio dives, he lives\
  \ in the ocean. He\u2019s far from the problems and poverty of the town he grew\
  \ up in, even though the reef isn\u2019t far from the Belizean shore. \nAs my air\
  \ runs out, I come back to the surface, bobbing with the rough choppy waves. I haul\
  \ my body and equipment up the ladder back onto the boat but my mind is still underwater.\
  \ On the beach, Gio opens up with us about the dangers of his second job- filling\
  \ the air tanks that we use to dive. He worked with a guy that died when a tank\
  \ exploded years ago. That\u2019s not part of the floating, problemless being I\
  \ saw at the bottom of the ocean. Maybe Gio, and the ocean, aren\u2019t as untouched\
  \ by the harsh outer world as they appear. \nDivers always start in the shallows\
  \ and gradually work their way down farther. With Gio, I leave my struggles on shore\
  \ to grow in the Caribbean Sea. Like fish, kindred spirits group together to dive\
  \ deeper."
