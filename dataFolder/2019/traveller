Text: "Traveller know about travelling place and also about culture and India is known\
  \ as home of different culture and at every distinct millimetres lauguage and culture\
  \ changes .... India is home of different languages but same hearts and love to\
  \ their motherland and tell they belong to India..\n\n I found different people\
  \ with different culture with different food style.....\n\nPeople are helping and\
  \ help to tell some old places with history...\nI visit temple , gurdwara , mosque\
  \ , church and I found ALL religion  at same place... Within 2km I found temple\
  \ , gurdwara, mosque , church....\n\nI go to library and found about Indian old\
  \ history.... Indian history divided into 3 parts ... Ancient , medieval , modern\
  \ history.....\nIndia is have different locations like sea , desert and forest and\
  \ mountain.....\n\nIndia all people are happy .... I see poor and rich area and\
  \ but people have good character ...India is vast and India have 29 States and 7\
  \ Union Territory ....\n\nI watch 15 August a special and important day in India\
  \ history is freedom ....in Goa Fishing with the locals off the east coast of Bali\
  \ and then getting it all cooked up with rice, chilli and satay on the beach, washed\
  \ down with a cold one....\n\nI'd have to say going to india with People to People.\
  \ It was amazing...big group so I made a lot of friends and I got to experience\
  \ a lot. The only downfall would be the lack of openness, we couldn't wander where\
  \ ever but then again I was in ninth grade =) Still amazing sights and I'd definitly\
  \ go back. \n\nEarly on a cloudy, windy and wet spring morning standing in front\
  \ of Stonehenge. I remember there were very few tourists there at that time of day,\
  \ and the combination of this amazing stone circle, the deep hues of green pastures...\n\
  \n\nStanding on the Great Wall of Rajasthan in India (know as second great wall\
  \ of world after China great wall)on a blustery, yet sunny, fall day. I remember\
  \ thinking the wall looked like a giant serpent across the rolling hills. To be\
  \ honest I didn't really enjoy my overall experience at the Great Wall but my partner\
  \ and I were able to find a moment together at a quiet section of the wall to appreciate\
  \ the place for what it was."
