Text: "To any foreigner who identifies as being Black, or as being of the African\
  \ diaspora, the lack of interconnectedness we feel towards our native continent\
  \ is similar to an electronic device not being able to pair with its home Wi-Fi\
  \ signal--it\u2019s unrecognizable on both sides.  The history, to us, is muddled\
  \ or unknown, the culture isn\u2019t embraced, and our understanding of African\
  \ beauty standards seems wrongfully exotic.  So how does one connect?  \nOne must\
  \ go there.\n\n\nThe Cows, the Roosters, and the Children\n\n\nWe\u2019d traveled\
  \ over 17 hours by commercial air across Africa, 2 hours by propeller plane over\
  \ the expanse of Lake Victoria, and 4 hours by bus through the valleys of Dar es\
  \ Salaam, Tanzania.  We\u2019d finally arrived in the jungle of the Kagera region,\
  \ a small Tanzanian city bordering Kenya to the south.\n\nThe earth looked bloodstained;\
  \ as if our ancestors\u2019 last dying wish was to breathe life into the ferrous\
  \ and copper-rich clay.  The surrounding jungle created this protective, steamy\
  \ canopy of deep, hydrated green that contrasted sharply with the vivid sanguine\
  \ tones of the earth.  Overhead, monkeys whooped and Kingfisher birds chirped.\n\
  \nI\u2019d been given strict instructions not to stray too far from our camp, but\
  \ curiosity had gotten the better of me and at first light one morning I set out\
  \ with the earliest risers\u2026the cows, roosters and the children.\n\nIt would\
  \ be the children who would help me see the real Africa.\n\n\nCherish the Children\n\
  \nNo more than six and seven years old, these tiny but mighty troopers walked determinedly\
  \ for miles to school each day.  Readied with one thinly bound notebook and one\
  \ pencil, the kids hummed their way to the schoolhouse.  The eyed me excitedly from\
  \ a distance, intrigued that I was traveling amongst them that morning.\n\nTo any\
  \ foreigner coming from America, where elementary school facilities are almost on\
  \ par with universities, one is unable to imagine a school without Internet and\
  \ iPad-integrated lessons, or basic amenities such as light fixtures and water fountains.\
  \  Yet as I stood on that red earth, I stared bewilderingly at the brick building\
  \ before me, adorned with glassless windows and doorless doorways and thought, how\
  \ can anyone learn here?  Yet here the children were, actively engaging in their\
  \ lesson every day, the enthusiasm matching mine when I went to school.\n\nFor me,\
  \ having never visited Africa before, I\u2019d been conditioned to envision the\
  \ Motherland in no way other than desolate and destitute.  This mindset left little\
  \ room for growth and open-mindedness. I was challenged not to look at Tanzania\
  \ through the oculus of a predisposed lens.\n\nReturning back to the school later\
  \ that day with my parents, we were greeted this time by squealing and laughing\
  \ children, pulling our arms in every direction to play and talk to them on their\
  \ courtyard.  As we gave away school supplies and gifts from America, the children\
  \ danced and sang reveling with their new markers, crayons, and notebooks as if\
  \ they were gold\u2026 and in some ways, they were just as valuable. \n\nAs an only\
  \ child, I didn\u2019t expect to feel so protective towards these small boys and\
  \ girls who were so elated to see us, yet here I was feeling as if I owed them so\
  \ much more than my measly few hours.  I\u2019d wanted to stay\u2026to teach them,\
  \ learn from them and immerse myself as a foreigner in my home continent. \n\nChildren\
  \ have this uncanny ability to see the positivity in every situation.  Too young\
  \ to accept the imbalances of the world, their idealistic optimism is refreshing\
  \ to those of us who know too much for our own good.  More than just the future,\
  \ children serve as a window into what the world is before systemic classification\
  \ and before dreams become harder to actualize.  It makes the local connection with\
  \ them \u2026 all the more unforgettable."
