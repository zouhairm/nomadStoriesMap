Text: "It was 13:00, the Sun seared my skin and drank my sweat drying me even more.\
  \ With just a lemon soda and a dosa in my belly since morning, I somehow managed\
  \ to travel for twelve hours to reach MURUDESHWAR from HOSPET. It was the journey\
  \ which tested my patience. A woman shared my seat and started to drool on me always.\
  \ Every speed breaker on the road made her butt fall on me. Her snore made me, even\
  \ more, frustrate which led me to put on my headphones. Her weight would be double\
  \ of mine, and the road had many speed breakers than I imagined. Every stroke she\
  \ gifted me with her butt bones, wracked me down. By the time we reached, half of\
  \ my pant was filled with her stains of saliva.\nAs soon as I stepped off my bus\
  \ in Murudeshwar, I was astonished facing the majestic twenty storey Gopura (2nd\
  \ tallest Gopura in ASIA) with two concrete elephants welcoming at its entrance\
  \ to either side. Having my camera backpack, I walked through the entrance gate,\
  \ which let me completely lose into admiration for the SHIVA Statue. Permitting\
  \ my face held high, I faced towards the 123 feet \u2018Shiva\u2019 meditating isolated.\
  \ Started to ruminate on the sculpture, I rummaged for my words to describe him.\
  \ Not that I was a whole packed religious bloke! I certainly had a heart of giving\
  \ credit to the sculptor. I thought I should never escape being in the temple, for\
  \ the festival. So, I went back to Virupaksha and was astonished seeing hundreds\
  \ of people like a forceful flowing stream of a river, crammed up, chanting to God.\
  \ I sat beside some local kids for that night, participated in their beautiful religious\
  \ songs (as if I knew Kannada). There I found a saint being completely naked. I\
  \ went and asked him the reason for being a sadhu (saint). He stared straight at\
  \ my eyes for a while and replied: \u201CNakedness was the only way to show how\
  \ free my soul was to SHIVA\u201D.\n\nCrores of hopes, Lakhs of devotees, millions\
  \ of prayers. Does God really listen to all their wishes?\n\nIt was 3:00 AM. The\
  \ sky was dark as hell, the street lights flickered making me fear of loneliness.\
  \ My panic levels raised up with some street dogs fights and howls. Despite being\
  \ sleepless for the past few days I was anguished to have a good slumber. I strolled\
  \ to every good hotel for a room but was demanded an abundant amount even for a\
  \ one night stay. I don\u2019t have the other option. I was on the roads. My muscle\
  \ sapped up and asked my brain to take rest. My empty stomach began to order me\
  \ for food, while my eyes started to cry for sleep. Stumbling on roads with fear,\
  \ every minute seemed to be an hour. As there was no charge on mobile and camera,\
  \ I conceived to go to the railway station.\nAfter I lurched for a 10-minute walk\
  \ to the station, I rested myself for a while in the waiting hall. I put my phone\
  \ under the charge and opened my book to read. Meanwhile, a group of hippies joined\
  \ me in the waiting room. Unlocking their bags, they rummaged something deep inside\
  \ their bags. Taking out some ganja packets, some of them started rolling it in\
  \ papers. Everyone had a headband with embroidered shroom shoulder bags, \u2018\
  Tree of Life\u2019 Necklaces, Rings for almost every finger, pierced stones for\
  \ their earlobes and tongue, Bracelets and Om shirts. Some hippies had LSD\u2019\
  s, Marijuana, weed, tobacco., Then there was me having empty chips cover, empty\
  \ lemon rice packets, dead camera, phone, two novels and a travel guide. That very\
  \ authentic moment of my life., one of the hippies who were high on the drug, gave\
  \ me a proper meaning of travelling. He said, \u201CTravel is all about the life\
  \ you\u2019d want to live; breeze you\u2019d prefer to feel; people you\u2019d like\
  \ to meet; dishes you\u2019d die to taste and the sky you\u2019d realise to gaze.\
  \ It achieves connecting one\u2019s soul to the soil, the shore, the Zephyr and\
  \ the atmosphere.\u201D"
