Text: "In the end, the violence of the winds in Malmo turned out to be true. I was\
  \ warned by Geron, a retired train driver, as he watched my bicycle brimming with\
  \ sarcasm. We connected. I was captivated by his naughty gaze and temperance. I\
  \ never asked him what he saw in me, what was hidden behind that question mark drawn\
  \ between his eyebrows. It did not take more than a second coffee to share something\
  \ more personal, more intimate, a memory of his childhood. At the end of the last\
  \ school year, Geron and all the girls and boys of his class cycled the route between\
  \ Trelleborg and Ystad. He spoke to me about salt, about wind, about sand, about\
  \ friendship, about the end of an era. Afterwards: the war. Probably it was not\
  \ the what but the how he said it, but that is why I am fulfilling a dream today.\
  \ I am an open person, you know it, a wise apprentice who learned to listen to advice.\
  \ Fourteen kilometers south of Trelleborg, in the southernmost geographical point\
  \ of Sweden you will find a lighthouse, the lighthouse of Suggehuk from where I\
  \ am writing you. \nProud, protective, solitary. What secret this passion hides\
  \ is a mystery that I do not know if I want to solve, that does not correspond to\
  \ me. But the curiosity knocks on the door and when I open it you appear drawing\
  \ memories with a rigging, times of youth, of south wind and tubes at low tide,\
  \ smelling like coconut, hashish and sex, of readings of Jack London to feed my\
  \ dreams. Bare feet, black skin and white nails, saltpeter and knots in the hair,\
  \ salty taste; let's leave the sweetness for the children and the old ones. My childhood\
  \ is sea, my youth is ocean and my future is water turned into heaven. Horizon,\
  \ the more I pedal towards, I never arrive.\nBut I imagine that by now you're wondering\
  \ why the hell I am living in a lighthouse in southern Sweden, so if you like, I'll\
  \ open my journal and start from the beginning. So many things have happened that\
  \ it will be nice to remember it."
