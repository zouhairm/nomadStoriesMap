Text: "I shall not forget in a hurry the first feel of Brazil. Sao Paolo is a breeze.\
  \ Perhaps overwhelmed by the relentless wave of tourists descending from the sky\
  \ for the 2014 World Cup, immigration officials at the Guarulhos International Airport\
  \ admit all arrivals brandishing necessary entry papers. \n\nI go on to arrange\
  \ a connecting flight, and promptly encounter the first culture shock: language.\
  \ In response to multiple sentences in English, the Portuguese-speaking World Cup\
  \ volunteer loses patience and motions the visitor towards not-so-apparent exits.\
  \ But which is which? Two Ethiopian fellows in a similar quandary want to know.\
  \ Sorry, can\u2019t tell. Just passing through. \n\nHours of waiting and a night\
  \ flight into Brazil\u2019s Northeast after, the lights of Salvador, less intimidating\
  \ but no less impressive than Sao Paolo\u2019s, guide the mighty mechanical bird\
  \ in whose belly rides I \u2013 lately football tourist \u2013 to a stop. Bem-vindo!\
  \ Welcome!\n\nFinding a bureau de change, or casa de c\xE2mbio, I change my first\
  \ dollars into the Brazilian currency, real; plural reais (R$). Mercifully, the\
  \ clerk at the c\xE2mbio, Rodrigues, speaks English. I\u2019m here for the World\
  \ Cup from Nigeria, I say in response to his opening enquiry. I\u2019ve come to\
  \ watch my favourite teams Spain and the Netherlands play at Salvador\u2019s Arena\
  \ Fonte Nova and to research Brazil\u2019s connection with African history, instead.\n\
  \nRodrigues envies me. I wish I can watch my favourite team, Germany, he says. But\
  \ I\u2019m too busy and cannot afford a match ticket. Do you know Germany are coming\
  \ in tonight through this airport? \n\nWhat? That ramps my World Cup excitement\
  \ fever-high. I find a seat with a good view of all the escalators in sight, and\
  \ promptly doze off. \n\nAt daybreak, a taxi ride into town opens the city to opening\
  \ scrutiny. Where\u2019s everybody? I wonder, after settling into the Patamares\
  \ hotel where Julie, the receptionist and a multiracial Bahian woman, graciously\
  \ waives the common hotel protocol of noon check-in to put the visitor at ease.\
  \ At home sleeping, she says. It\u2019s Sunday! \n\nThe curt reply partly describes\
  \ my first real acquaintance in Brazil. Also my first Portuguese teacher, she introduces\
  \ me to Bahian life and the city\u2019s beloved football team, Esporte Clube Bahia,\
  \ affectionately called Bahia. Say it: Ba-hia! I do. Ba-hia! \n\nIn various ways,Julie\
  \ and the hotel staff make the first half of my Brazil stay unforgettable. Mornings\
  \ begin with a hearty Bom dia! It is followed by buffet breakfast supervised by\
  \ effervescent cook and personal favourite, Dorival. Daily, the Mesti\xE7o chef\
  \ recommends the sumptuousness of every pastry, dish and concoction with a lip-smacking\
  \ effect somewhat suggestive of his native Brazilian roots.\n\nBy the simplest of\
  \ gestures, yet another favourite, Lorina, makes my second day. Succeeding Julie\
  \ on her shift, she couldn\u2019t have contrived a warmer meeting. Hi, I\u2019m\
  \ Lorina. I\u2019m on shift today. Julie told me about you. She told me to take\
  \ care of you. So what would you want?\n\nYes, there are things I want, need even.\
  \ But she can\u2019t do some of them, the language barrier being so formidable.\
  \ Unlike Julie, Lorina struggles with her English. With you, I can practice it,\
  \ my English, she says, matter-of-fact. My husband tells me not to be too shy about\
  \ speaking, but I always fear that people will laugh at me. So all the time, please\
  \ speakee with me. \n\nBut she strains to interpret my hankering for pepper in food,\
  \ Nigerian style. The average Brazilian might think the typical table laid to appetising\
  \ delight, but not me. Regardless of the balance or variety, serving steak or fish\
  \ and rice without some edible oil or pepper is plain unpalatable. I suffer and\
  \ swiftly become home-sick.\n\nI regret not my first dip into a lifelong bucket\
  \ list, however, for a berth in the land of football and guarana, the sweet fruit\
  \ at the base of stimulating beverages. In gradual measure, I savour the country\
  \ of carnivals and street parties fuelled by samba and cervaja, or beer. I revel\
  \ in the state of Bahia and its capital and cultural melting pot, Salvador. With\
  \ time and luck, I think, lasting connections stretch across borders."
