Text: "I was walking down Soi 11 in downtown Bangkok, with traffic hustling across\
  \ the zebra crossings as the crowds rushed by on a busy weeknight . Roadside stands\
  \ smelled of gravy and mustard sauce inviting my senses. Hunger approached as so\
  \ did next trip to the airport as my weekend spirit awakened, anticipating yet another\
  \ journey from within a journey. There was more in the mountains that awaited me\
  \ and i took my next flight to another part of Thailand , towards the North, away\
  \ from the metropolis diving further into the world i yearned to explore- The ancient\
  \ North. \nThe air was different, crispier and cleaner , promising a heightened\
  \ sense of adventure.  I took a bus across to the central square , known as the\
  \ Night Bazaar- the beautiful night spot in the middle of the wonderful city of\
  \ Chaing Mai.  The world beckoned.  Silk shops, antiques, clothes, pearls, food\
  \ and drinks and a great lively spirit of culture and happiness. I sat down with\
  \ my bags, got some currency exchanged by a corner shop and looked around at the\
  \ diversity of Thailand , its people & the sheer feeling of being in a beautiful\
  \ arena that surrounded me. I breathed in the air & felt reborn.  The mountains\
  \ stood further north as lights blinked across the hills , on the far side of town.\
  \ Soon , there will be time to reach the stars and hold the clouds. Soon there will\
  \ be light as the day breaks tomorrow. I will be ready. The ancient north had so\
  \ far to show me as the temples of the ancient Gods beckoned me forward, to the\
  \ most unforgettable story of my life. The Big Buddha stared down from across the\
  \ hills of Chaing Mai , looking upon us all . It was long journey by foot - hundreds\
  \ of steps up the mountain side. I will be there. \nEach moment made new sense,\
  \ each step was a new direction.  I was alone but fulfilled for the new phase of\
  \ my journey into the ancient world of the mountains has begun.  The Temples of\
  \ the Golden Gods would take me to them.  I longed in anticipation and smiled at\
  \ the sky, Life was beautiful and times were changing. The spirits of the Gods were\
  \ with me.  I felt content & awakened. The journey would be something to remember.\
  \  Tales untold would be brought to life. I walked across the dim lit corridors\
  \ of the bazaar in the dead of night. The Morning after, will be something amazing.\
  \  The Ancient New Journey would change my life."
