Text: "As your teenage years finally go to an end and a breath of \u201Cthe real freedom\u201D\
  \ sweetly kiss your neck, you get to the point when, you believe, finally the life\
  \ will start. Of course, life goes as it wants and instead of absolute power and\
  \ control, you go and make brand new mistakes, as in my case it was getting into\
  \ a pretty unhappy and draining relationship.\n\nThere was one day, though, when\
  \ I decided to say enough. The charm of being in love had nothing to do with freedom\
  \ which was always my absolute priority and my soul yearned to hitch-hike again\
  \ and live through new adventures which used to fill my high school years. \n\n\
  The silver lining of being already \u2018a grown-up\u2019 and the decision of hitting\
  \ the road went beautifully hand in hand. My Brazilian friend happened to be in\
  \ Berlin, I studied 2 hours from the capital of Germany, in Pozna\u0144, Poland.\
  \ We decided to meet, rent a car and just go whenever we wanted. Finally, we felt\
  \ free, joyful and we could be real instead of trying to meet people's standards\
  \ and expectations.\n\nWe went south. The final destination was Croatia but the\
  \ real magic and wonders happened on the road. I will never forget driving on the\
  \ highway along Vienna almost 180 km per hour, listening PJ Harvey on full volume,\
  \ having shades and feeling and therefore being absolutely fabulous. (Yes, a little\
  \ wink to my favourite sitcom). I felt free from the burdens that I had left in\
  \ my city, bad relationships and boring studies, all that didn\u2019t matter because\
  \ back ta that very moment we were faster than we should have and we couldn\u2019\
  t be happier and more independent. \n\nWhen we were driving through Slovakia, we\
  \ noticed a vintage car driven by a girl who wore some absolutely magnificent black\
  \ dress full of laces and huge hat in a french style. When I looked left, there\
  \ was the Adriatic sea. The girl waved to us, we waved back and we felt that amazing\
  \ human connection, how the world was our oysters and how we can do whatever we\
  \ want if  only we just press the courage and make a decision to move on. \n\nUnfortunately,\
  \ my Brazilian friend was the only one with the driving license, therefore we decided\
  \ to take a break and sleep in a tent in some Slovenian fields. However, all of\
  \ them seemed to be a private property turned into some touristy camps and everything\
  \ was already booked.\nObviously, we wanted to spend as little money as possible,\
  \ from a very simple reason of not having much, but we ended up in a beautiful hotel\
  \ in Izola. I  had never heard about that place before but everything looked stunning.\
  \ The beach, the sunset, the narrow streets and all the buildings with simple, wooden\
  \ and therefore the most beautiful window shutters. \nTo commemorate finding a nice\
  \ hotel and basically the whole amazing life, we bought two bottles of wine and\
  \ decided to go and sit (!) in the sea and drink it while our sandals were swimming\
  \ away from us and mine didn\u2019t come back and I genuinely hope they are still\
  \ happily floating somewhere or maybe even someone managed to get them and use them\
  \ and the thought how everything circles around our planet made me really ecstatic.\
  \ \n\nIn the background we could hear laughters and chats of people dining in the\
  \ restaurants on the seaside. All the foreign languages were mixing and me and Camila,\
  \ my Brazilian soulmate, we felt that we are a part of the perfect wholeness, of\
  \ the human race and that it\u2019s only up to us how we live our lives and that\
  \ you really can do it. It\u2019s all about the first step, then life takes over\
  \ and it will hold you by the hand telling you it may not be always easy but girl,\
  \ you will enjoy the waltz."
