Text: "The jeep had been battling the boggy ruts for several long hours, striking\
  \ a dangerous passage through the roof of the world. We had left Manali for Leh\
  \ at midnight, and driven north into the night. \n\nMy Himalayan trip was following\
  \ four tumultuous months in Southest Asia, where tethers to my previous sense of\
  \ selfhood had slackened. The untethering began when a sly hand absconded with my\
  \ only comfortable footwear, and concluded with the lid closing on a dissolved relationship\
  \ somewhere at the Plain Of Jars in Phonsavan. \n\nI had thought perhaps I would\
  \ find both clarity and closure where the air was thin. Maybe I would rest on a\
  \ mountainside, slurp a lassi and play some chess with a Turkish traveller under\
  \ the sunflowers, all while regaining a grasp on myself. I was ready to arrive.\
  \ The next place was waiting for me.\n\nA vision of my mother\u2019s concerned brow\
  \ had haunted my decision to go the 24-hour drive to Leh without a stopover to acclimatise,\
  \ but with determination to visit the apple orchards of the Kullu Valley, I had\
  \ chosen daughterly guilt and adventure over a short high altitude flight from Delhi.\n\
  \nAt the rear of the jeep, my perch over the wheel had secured a dynamic relationship\
  \ between the road and myself. With every dip I felt my body move in an impulsive\
  \ and cinematic convulsion. My neighbour, an elderly Ladakhi man, had taken kindly\
  \ to my shoulder as his headrest, and groaned as we lurched onwards.\n\nFrom first\
  \ light emerged the shadow of giants. Spectres of geological glory, vague apparitions\
  \ too large to comprehend rising heavenwards; and beyond the sliver of road to my\
  \ right, the valley walls descending into an abyss of black.\n\nUpwards was the\
  \ dim ribbon of several hundred vehicles caught in the chaos of a traffic jam. It\
  \ was backed up by several kilometres and entrenched in the dregs of a deteriorating\
  \ one-lane road. This dawn party forced our jeep to a standstill. \n\nAccustomed\
  \ to the jeeps movement, the immediate stillness sent my awareness to my body. My\
  \ ears echoed with a muffled ringing, my fingers were pink and plump. I tried to\
  \ bend my knuckles but was met with the taut resistance akin to a bee sting. Most\
  \ noticeably was an inner movement, the untimely yet urgent necessity to answer\
  \ nature\u2019s call.\n\nPlease, not now, I thought.\n\nThe recent past had presented\
  \ me with difficulties I had weathered with only a little fuss. Besides the shoes\
  \ and breakup, I had succeeded in recovering a stolen passport, survived a tame\
  \ yet rather rattling mugging in an industrial city in Thailand, and saved myself\
  \ from drowning in the spring rapids of Sai Yok National Park. This challenge was\
  \ different. I had the illusion that arrival into higher altitudes would have me\
  \ transcend human processes and deliver me to the realm of the gods. \n\nPlease,\
  \ not now.\n\nResistance was futile. My dignity was on the line. The jeep felt claustrophobic\
  \ and the windows steamed as I became hot and irritable.  I made it known that I\
  \ needed to exit the vehicle, and eleven men, as if awakened from a stupor, looked\
  \ at me curiously, with my long braids and red skirt and blue flip flops, two sizes\
  \ too big. \n \nOut of the jeep I jumped into a foot of mud, whipped stiff by the\
  \ beating of tires. Men in shawls, leaning jauntily against the colourful masterpieces\
  \ painted on the cheeks of their trucks, turned their eyes in silence. The sun was\
  \ rising over a distant valley as I followed the road to a bend. \n\nAmongst the\
  \ dewy wildflowers in shades of purple, amongst a sea of offerings both fresh and\
  \ ancient, where sad wisps of soggy loo rolls were tucked neatly under fallen rocks,\
  \ I humbled myself where other\u2019s calls had been too been answered. I was not\
  \ out of eyesight. \n\nUnexpectedly in this moment, I found a rising in my throat\
  \ and a tickle of mirth in my chest. It was my old humoured self, returning. I had\
  \ arrived between destinations at the clarity I sought, and I had the last laugh."
