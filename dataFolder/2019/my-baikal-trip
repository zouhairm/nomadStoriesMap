Text: "When you think you can't travel because you have no money - you wrong.\nWhen\
  \ you think you know your country after living in one city all the time - damn!\
  \ You are so wrong.\nWhen you think most of the people are angry - you, again, wrong.\n\
  \nHow to be right? Just step outside your comfort area. Like me. In 2010, I decided\
  \ to hitchhike with my friend from Ekaterinburg to Baikal. Because it was the cheapest\
  \ way for me as a student. It was a great adventure, which I never forget. We stopped\
  \ cars, talking about so many things with peoples, living in a tent, hotels.\n\n\
  Sometimes we go under the rain, wet, angry, dirty, no one wants to drive with us,\
  \ we wanted to step back, and go home. And at this moment we realized one thing.\
  \ In all kinds of a journey there is a point when you want to step back, and if\
  \ you deal with it, you finish the journey. \n\nWe passed over 7000 kilometers in\
  \ 12 days, we met so many good drivers and peoples, all of them have their own life\
  \ story. We had been diving into ice tempered mountain river and just sitting under\
  \ the black night sky with shining stars. It was an awesome journey which changed\
  \ us inside. Now we know that restrictions mostly placed in our mind. No money -\
  \ this is only an excuse for not wanting to change something.\nWe start big journeys\
  \ to change places, but they change our soul."
