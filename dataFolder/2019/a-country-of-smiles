Text: "\"Sixteen days,\" I whispered to myself, staring at the mountains below me\
  \ as my plane descended into San Salvador. I had given myself sixteen days to hike,\
  \ ride Chicken buses and hitch rides from El Salvador to San Jose, Costa Rica. I\
  \ had done my research, read forums and blogs, where to go and not to go, and the\
  \ MUST SEE locations. But even tho my Spanish was weak, to say the least, I wanted\
  \ to see the REAL Central America...the people. Sure I wanted to see the beautiful\
  \ beaches and hike the lush, green rainforests of extinct volcanoes, but it was\
  \ the people I wanted to hang out with, laugh with, learn what they eat, what's\
  \ most important to them, their home life, their work life.\nMy journey started\
  \ with an all day tour with a friendly guy named, Miguel. He pulled up to my quaint\
  \ little hotel in a Toyota Camry, not the typical mini bus. It was just me and him\
  \ for eight hours. I thought to myself, if this guy isn't very talkative it's going\
  \ to be a LONG day. But, as soon as I climbed in he threw me a big smile and introduced\
  \ himself. From that moment, we were best buddies because I like everyone and I\
  \ never meet a stranger. We criss-crossed El Salvador like an Indiana Jones treasure\
  \ map. Volcanoes, coffee bean plantations, Cathedrals and bright, dusty little towns.\
  \ I must of asked poor Miquel a hundred questions. I wanted to know EVERYTHING about\
  \ his beautiful little country. I learned more in eight hours talking to my driver\
  \ and visiting little towns than I would reading ten books. When our trek was over\
  \ I hugged my new friend and felt an overwhelming amount of gratitude. I felt so...\"\
  educated\" about a new place.\nThe next day I met a very nice couple who gave me\
  \ a ride to the Honduran border where I hopped on a Tica bus - sort of like an old\
  \ tour bus. Upon boarding I was quickly told, since I was an American to not get\
  \ off in Honduras for very long because of political unrest and safety concerns.\
  \ Even tho Im very adventurous and can take care of myself, I also had to use common\
  \ since. I didn't want to be robbed or held up in some Honduran jail so I only spent\
  \ one day in Honduras. I was also traveling in the central part of these countries\
  \ and the Pacific coast - which is MUCH different than the Caribbean coast. \nA\
  \ better peace of mind ran over me once I entered Nicaragua. Ive always been fascinated\
  \ with volcanoes, and even tho Ive experienced some of the best in Hawaii and Iceland,\
  \ Nicaragua was full of them. And Masaya was at the top of my list. An active volcano\
  \ that's a must see at nighttime. My little 12 passenger tour bus was filled with\
  \ people from Germany, Japan, France, Australia and me, the lone American. That's\
  \ the most amazing thing with traveling abroad, you get to meet people from around\
  \ the world and learn so much from each other. We were all mesmerized at the \"\
  Gate way to Hell\" as it was so aptly named. the glow of the flowing lava was other\
  \ worldly.\nThe next few days I rode Chicken buses ( Old American school buses pimped\
  \ out) down through this amazing country, overnighting in cheap, but clean hostels,\
  \ meeting generous, kind people who always tried to help with their broken English\
  \ and my pitiful Spanish. I had heard so much about Ometepe Island, I just had to\
  \ get a ferry and see for myself. I met a sweet young lady that invited me to stay\
  \ in their home. I ended up staying a week with this amazing family, eating meals,\
  \ riding scooters, playing with kids, swimming. Their way of life was so calm, easy\
  \ going. I was so surprised at how happy they were with so little. Family and church\
  \ was SO important to them. I honestly did not want to leave. They had pizza and\
  \ coke, too, so I was good. It was so wonderful that I only got to spend 2 days\
  \ in Costa Rica."
