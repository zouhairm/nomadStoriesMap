Text: "To my unborn child,\n\n\tThe clouds are calling me. ( Wait, did that sound\
  \ too ominous?) \nSimple times. Simple joys. Simple stories.These few days have\
  \ been full of them, amidst the little moments of heartbreak that I\u2019ve come\
  \ to accept. \u201CJekhane porbe shethai dekhebe alo\u201D ( A Bengali adage that\
  \ literally translates to: wherever you will fall you will see light) only happens\
  \ when you are light. Yet the mountains have a way of taking the sadness right out\
  \ of my snub nose and monster-eaten fingers. Cathartic without quite fitting the\
  \ way that word is often used. \n\tI\u2019m sitting on the rooftop patio of a homestead\
  \ in Rinchengpong, West Sikkim. The clouds look like those Japanese washing method\
  \ paintings. The billowing ones that rise up in angry concentric circles over a\
  \ setting sea. I have too many deadlines back home. The online courses. Assignments.\
  \ Entrances. When I escaped to Darjeeling a few days ago, I couldn\u2019t sleep\
  \ because of them. Part of me wanted to take the next flight home and get back to\
  \ my \u2018real life\u2019. And now, as I spoon mouthful after mouthful of dry \"\
  khichdi\" ( a lentil and rice concoction found in myriad forms across India) made\
  \ with an unfamiliar root that can be found only in the months before the rains,\
  \ all I hear are lines of that Nora Jones song that used to play day in and out\
  \ back home in Seattle\n               All my love is like a lost balloon\n    \
  \           Rising up through the afternoon\n               Till it could fit on\
  \ the head of a pin\nIt\u2019s been difficult to write. To find things to say. I\u2019\
  ve been angry, sad and not sure where to go next. Even now, as I write these words\
  \ in a book I take with me whenever I run off on these adventures that I end up\
  \ escaping, I can\u2019t help but feel a little less somehow for regressing. Using\
  \ this book as a heal write was never my intention. I want to read more, think more,\
  \ connect more, childish as that sounds. I want to become the person who will someday\
  \ make a life for you. So when I write things like \u2018I\u2019ve been angry, sad\u2019\
  , it feels like I\u2019m still stuck in Ms.Cordell\u2019s fourth grade writing course\
  \ with constant emphasis in that droning voice, urging us to show more than tell.\n\
  \tMay be that\u2019s it. I look for answers in stories the same way I look for escapes\
  \ in places. \u2018Where do I really belong\u2019 is a question I haven\u2019t been\
  \ able to answer. Am I truly the historian I believed myself to be? Is that really\
  \ my preferred prism? There are so many compulsions these days. Constant deadlines\
  \ that never let up no matter how hard it is on other fronts. A war we fight with\
  \ ourselves, the ideas we have of how we look like, is as valid, as real as the\
  \ ones we fight with the world around us. We\u2019re surrounded by showing moments.\
  \ Whenever we open our mouths, someone wants us to open it again. And again and\
  \ again. I can\u2019t help but wonder if these showing tests are the true tests.\n\
  \tEither way, escaping is as real to me as the real life that waits at the end of\
  \ the adventure. It was nice to step back for a while. The mountains force me to\
  \ pause in a way that I can\u2019t seem to anywhere else. And for what its worth,\
  \ an old lover, if nothing else, is worthy of a while.\n                       \
  \                                                                  -October 18th,\
  \ 2018\n                                                                       \
