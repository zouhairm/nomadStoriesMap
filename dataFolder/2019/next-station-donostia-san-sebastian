Text: "Miranda de Ebro was the city that fired me from Castilian lands. In just a\
  \ few minutes the train would glide through the Basque Country. I noticed it especially\
  \ in the landscape that went from a pale yellow and monochrome to a leafy green\
  \ and full of life. The typical rain of the north got that not summer could snatch\
  \ them of that wild nature. Soon we passed through Vitoria, and then through towns\
  \ and cities with an irrevocable name for someone who does not speak Basque. I was\
  \ already beginning to feel that accumulation of sensations and perceptions that\
  \ I had the first time I stepped on San Sebasti\xE1n. I could still only smell them.\
  \ I remembered very well the first time I went. Unfortunately for her, Elena was\
  \ my companion. We had prepared a five-day trip to rest and have a little time for\
  \ ourselves. Neither of them could imagine that the trip would end in this way.\
  \ The first day, just after getting off the train, I already had a tingling in my\
  \ stomach and in the part of my ankles that I had never had, maybe because I had\
  \ never left my town. All my life trapped in a prison of invisible walls and, finally,\
  \ I was about to know what it was like to live. The sea breeze caressed my face\
  \ as soon as I got out of the car. It was summer. August 2005. Hundreds of guiris\
  \ and countrymen toured the city, under the appeased gaze of the Christ of Monte\
  \ Urgull. The first day things went more or less well. We visited the city like\
  \ the tourists we were. We throw ourselves on the beach to sunbathe and play with\
  \ the powerful waves of La Concha Bay. However, everything changed suddenly. And\
  \ because of me, as always. The second night I got an irrepressible desire to visit\
  \ the city and I could not help but escape from our hotel. I stayed until eight\
  \ in the morning only through the streets of the city, admiring every corner. It's\
  \ hard to explain but, for the first time, I saw someone I never thought I could\
  \ be. San Sebastian had marked a plot point.\n\nElena, of course, cared for me.\
  \ When he woke up and did not see me, he went out to look for me in the most obvious\
  \ places in the city. What she did not know was that I did not go around these places,\
  \ but in certain corners that nobody remembers. After all Elena did not know me\
  \ as much as we would have liked. When I finally arrived at the hotel she received\
  \ me mute. His silence murdered the years we had spent together. Everything built\
  \ so far fled through the window and was delivered to the sea. When returning to\
  \ the village nothing was the same. We continue together, in fits and starts, out\
  \ of boredom or laziness. But everything was over, and we both knew it. Remembering\
  \ that bittersweet story, a little voice rang through the train. \"Next station:\
  \ San Sebasti\xE1n - Donostia\". I felt a snake through my stomach. At last. It\
  \ had already been two in the morning. I was a little afraid to go only around the\
  \ city at that time, but my impatience was more powerful than my attitude. The sensations\
  \ of which I spoke earlier increased unchecked. He returned to that August of two\
  \ thousand five, but this time alone. Free. Without a past Without roots. As an\
  \ exile of war. Nothing to lose. With nothing to wait .. I could already see the\
  \ railroad station. Only two people were waiting on one of the platforms. A couple\
  \ of boyfriends. I imagined a story for them. She had to leave because her father\
  \ needed him in town. He would wait for him in his city, from now on his coffin.\
  \ But she would never come back. I left my violet bubble and returned to reality.\
  \ Probably the next day they would see each other again. In addition, it was not\
  \ the moment to create histories, but the one to become the protagonist of all of\
  \ them."
