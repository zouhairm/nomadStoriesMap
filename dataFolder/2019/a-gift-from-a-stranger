Text: "In early February, 2008, I couldn\u2019t withstand the desire any longer and\
  \ bought a plane ticket with my student loan money to Paris.\nI was set to leave\
  \ the day after Spring semester at UNM. I didn\u2019t know where I\u2019d stay or\
  \ what I\u2019d do\u2014only that I was so in love with the art movements and writers\
  \ and artists in modern French history that I had to get over there as soon as possible,\
  \ or my heart and brain would explode.\nI was telling someone about the plane ticket\
  \ on the patio of Winning Coffee in Albuquerque. An inconspicuous woman in a muumuu\
  \ overheard me a couple tables away. She said her name was Penelope, and she had\
  \ an artist nephew in South France. Maybe she could set something up for me. I gave\
  \ her my email address but thought nothing would come from it. She seemed sweet,\
  \ but maybe was a little nutty or lonely\u2014she didn\u2019t know me at all and\
  \ had no reason to help.\nA few days later, I received an email from her which proved\
  \ how wrong I was\u2014Penelope had hooked me up beyond the call of humanity. I\
  \ couldn\u2019t believe it.\nHer nephew lived with his artist wife in a succulent\
  \ village with cherry trees and magic and boulders the size of Alaska, which he\
  \ had to drive over to get into town.\nFor two weeks I lived on the second floor\
  \ at Paris\u2019s Shakespeare & Company Bookstore, working two hours a day for lodging\
  \ during its literary festival.\nI met write Paul Auster, and sat on a bench next\
  \ to the very aged and pale-eyed beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Then Penelope\u2019\
  s nephew picked me up at the train station in Hyeres, South France, presenting my\
  \ with a fresh onion and sardine tarte, a taste of local pride. I stayed in my own\
  \ little casita on his property in Toulon, and we ate dinner with the baron next\
  \ door. After dinner I\u2019d play them songs on the ukulele. During the day we\
  \ took lunch under a massive cherry tree.\nHis neighbors had goat farms, and I ended\
  \ up living with one of them (\u201Cneighbor\u201D is relative out there; their\
  \ home is on a neighboring mountain called Bormes les Mimosas). I made goat cheese\
  \ every single morning for two hours exactly, and then the rest of the day was mine\
  \ in, again, my own casita.\nFrench families in rural places don\u2019t just let\
  \ strangers from America stay with them and make cheese, but they thought I was\
  \ the muumuu-ed woman\u2019s nephew\u2019s niece, through some lost-in-translation\
  \ miscommunication, which I did not correct them on. So in that sense I was practically\
  \ family, in their mind, being related to a neighbor. None of this cost me one penny.\n\
  Actually, I made money.\nOne of the members of this family, a milliner, worked with\
  \ the Chamber of Commerce in Bormes les Mimosas. She hooked it up so that they gave\
  \ me a weekly gig playing ukulele in the village at night. I sang originals, American\
  \ songs, and Jacque Brel songs. No one knew what a ukulele was; it was amazing.\
  \ I made between 40 and 100 euros each time.\nI then went on to stay with another\
  \ member of this same family in nearby town on the water\u2014a regional wooden\
  \ boat captain expert who took me sailing a few times with the family over the clearest\
  \ cerulean blue water.\nThe whole thing was like a dream, looking back on it. A\
  \ gift from a stranger across the street from UNM.\nThis is why you honor your desires,\
  \ and tell everyone; they will never disappear, only fester and grow.\nThis story\
  \ illustrates my favorite Zen saying: Leap and the net will appear."
