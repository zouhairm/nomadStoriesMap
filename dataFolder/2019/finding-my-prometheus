Text: "Jeep\u2019s tires skidded against ice on a sharp turn and the next moment,\
  \ it was moving back into the ditch of folded mountains. Driver pulled the breaks\
  \ abruptly and the locals, accompanying to deal with unexpected situations, started\
  \ covering tires with iron chains; a traditional method to avoid vehicle slippage.\n\
  Instantly, my eyes met with a tall cherry-cheeked chap wearing a monkey cap, holding\
  \ kehwa-thermos, smiling upon my thrilled facial expressions. Air outside the vehicle\
  \ was frosting my nostrils with sun lightening his mysterious face.\nNext morning,\
  \ wearing tri-layered clothing and holding ski equipment, I was mounting for Naltar\
  \ slope. Naltar valley is situated in Karakarum mountains of Gilgit-Baltistan having\
  \      Pakistan-Air-Force ski-resort at the apex. It includes picturesque circular\
  \ green huts with turquoise-colored lake at back, facing frosted cream-topped mountains.\n\
  Having first experience of such altitude, as soon as I looked up, puffing steam\
  \ from my out-of-breath situation, I saw true colors of \u2018the best view comes\
  \ after the hardest climb\u2019. A wide straight slope was mounting down with ski-lift\
  \ and chair-lift on its sides. Skiers and snowboarders crossing each other down,\
  \ grand speakers thickening the air with pop-music, sun coming out of the slope\
  \ casting a moonlit reflection of snowflakes, colorful banners and poles against\
  \ white background making the slalom boundary, and a big wooden sun-room at the\
  \ bottom seemed to attract adventure aspirants. Examining snowflakes, their intricate\
  \ hexagonal patterns dumbfounded me. Fragile, but fierce as avalanche; unique like\
  \ souls, yet humble having heart of a dust particle. \nI saw the same mystical guy\
  \ there, selling kehwa. Asking for a cup inquiring his name, he answered \u201C\
  Karim\u201D, pouring kehwa. By offering him a seat, I initiated the chat. After\
  \ a while, we were twittering as if two lost friends have just caught up. Talking\
  \ about tourist attractions, he asked me, \n\t\u201CThere is a snow-leopard in the\
  \ woods. Would you like to go?\u201D\nConceding, we set off to a silent upward track.\
  \ Sun was playing hide-and-seek with us. Reaching the destiny, I saw what wasn\u2019\
  t expected. The animal, listed \u2018vulnerable\u2019 on the IUCN Red List of Threatened\
  \ Species 2017, was wandering around the cage in lonesome anxiety. Karim said,\n\
  \t\u201CA male once had escaped her from the cage, but due to pregnancy she couldn\u2019\
  t pass the cold stream. So, was caught again.\u201D\nAnd here it was, being caged\
  \ alone with a long furry tail, sweeping snow.\nAfterwards, Karim asked and insisted\
  \ to have dinner at his house as their local hospitality, down in the village. A\
  \ thousand watt smile crossed his cheeks upon hearing me consenting. \nIn the village,\
  \ there were wooden houses having two rooms for the whole family with a peculiar\
  \ stove inside, cooking food as well as heating room, coming down the mountain like\
  \ a pyramid in various colors. I schmoozed with the locals and learned a bit lingo.\
  \ Finally, I went to Karim\u2019s house, being his guest. Unlike others, his house\
  \ was a single big room in a courtyard fenced with sticks. Karim was an orphan and\
  \ the sole breadwinner among his seven younger siblings.\nIn dinner, I was served\
  \ with chapshoro (chopped lamb-meat filling in wheat chaupati), sweet freshly baked-bread\
  \ with apricot oil, diram, and mamtoo (curried-dumplings).  Drinking kehwa, I suddenly\
  \ saw a hand-crafted wooden board resting in a corner. Upon asking, I felt as if\
  \ Karim was reluctant to talk about it. Thereupon, his mother surprised me saying,\n\
  \t\u201CKarim has an intense interest in snowboarding. Because he isn\u2019t allowed\
  \ to do so on the slope, he practice it in the neighborhood during his leisure\u201D\
  \nA silenced pause fell afterwards. With the sound of firewood cracking in the room\
  \ and hazel-brown grim eyes conveying both longingness and helplessness, Karim was\
  \ looking a cap-a-pie silhouette of motivation. \nOn my way back as I looked above\
  \ to the starry sky, drenched in thoughts, I saw a shooting star. The mysterious\
  \ guy, igniting my inner fire and giving me the best gift of Magi on Christmas,\
  \ had turned out to be a Prometheus for me. \nI thought treading \u2018Yes, passion\
  \ is a shooting star. Far away from sight, it shoots for us when chased wholeheartedly\u2019\
  . Enlightenment fell upon my heart as I heard my passion calling my name."
