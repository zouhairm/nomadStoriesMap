Text: "As the bus driver turned into the quiet town, I watched the street signs in\
  \ fascination. \u201CJohn F Kennedy\u201D drive roared by as I began to think about\
  \ that day. April 29th 1945.\nAs we neared the site, I considered the some 31,000\
  \ individuals that lost their lives within the gates of this hell. The time had\
  \ neared, and I breathed a heavy sigh, briefly considering turning back. Would anyone\
  \ think the lesser of me if I walked away now? A voice inside me spoke with conviction,\
  \ as I knew that I needed to have this experience one last time. I stepped off the\
  \ bus and began to walk down the gravel road.\nAs I continued forward, I glanced\
  \ to the houses that lined the fences. 74 years ago, a massacre was happening in\
  \ the backyards of innocent people, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how. My\
  \ mind wandered as I heard the screams of suffering ringing in my eardrum. Like\
  \ a lightning bolt on the horizon, I came back to reality. One last corner separated\
  \ me and a distant memory of my first and most recent visit to Dachau concentration\
  \ camp. Although I was aware of what was coming, nothing can truly prepare you for\
  \ that moment. Crowds of people made their way around the bend in the path, talking\
  \ and laughing joyously with one and other- blissfully unaware of what was to come.\
  \ As the gate came into my line of vision, the air suddenly fell dead. \u201CArbeit\
  \ Macht Frei,\u201D a phrase often used in the Nazi death camps, lined the top of\
  \ the rusted metal gate. As the first person stepped forward to release it from\
  \ its hinge, a loud creaking noise sounded. I closed my eyes and breathed in sharply\
  \ before stepping forward and entering a place in which the word \u2018hell\u2019\
  \ can not even satisfy. \nI stepped forward and turned to the right hand side of\
  \ the grounds to continue around and visit each building. As most of Dachau was\
  \ torn down shortly after its liberation, many of the original structures no longer\
  \ stood. Despite this, the camp had been accurately restored and rebuilt for those\
  \ that choose to relive history. One by one, I walked into each building, considering\
  \ the photos of the bunks lined with starving men, woman, and children. As the crisp\
  \ fall air blew past my cheek, I couldn\u2019t help but imagine how winter fell\
  \ over these grounds. I was dressed in a thick parka and boots, far more clothing\
  \ than any prisoner was offered here. \nMy walk continued on slowly, and as I once\
  \ again reached the gate, I knew that I had one last place to return to. A small\
  \ path down the back end of the gravel square separated me and the building. I remembered\
  \ vividly my experience 4 years prior, and the flood of uncontrollable emotions\
  \ that followed. In my head, I knew my fear could never compare to the fear of those\
  \ that walked this camp before me. A silent echo, a cry for help, rang through the\
  \ camp as my imagination began to construct visions in my head. The building stood\
  \ weathered and aged, with two small sets of stairs leading to each door. Of the\
  \ thousands of recorded deaths here, most of the remains were carried through these\
  \ very same doors to be disposed of. The crematorium of Dachau concentration camp\
  \ is the last original, fully intact building. I could see the remnants of ash and\
  \ bone lining the large metal drums. In this moment, the air was so tense that you\
  \ could cut it with a butter knife. As an elderly lady beside me broke down. I reached\
  \ into my bag and handed her a tissue before turning to leave. My journey was complete,\
  \ and as I boarded the bus back to Munich, I suddenly realized that I had not spoken\
  \ one word since my arrival. The words \u201Cnever again\u201D escaped my lips as\
  \ we exited the town limits of Dachau. \n\u201CThose who cannot remember the past\
  \ are doomed to repeat it.\u201D"
