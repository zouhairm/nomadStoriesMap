Text: "When I was 18 I moved to the United Kingdom and started what has now became\
  \ my main activity: travel writing and journal keeping. At 23 years old I found\
  \ myself freshly gratuaded from an English Literature degree and working as a barman,\
  \ teaching assistant and translator in London, after having traveled on foot, in\
  \ a tent or with a bike throughout the British Isles, barely being able to pay the\
  \ rent. A tax return allowed me the freedom to buy a one way ticket for what became\
  \ a 6 months journey into Mother India. I decided not to stay in one place for more\
  \ than 3 days, and in the first months I covered from the edges of Jammu and Kashmir\
  \ (Shingu La, Himalayas) to the most distant cardinal points in India (Amritsar,\
  \ west; Tirunelveli, south; Kolkata, east). During this trip I kept a personal journal\
  \ but traveled without camera, phone or any other technology. A few years later,\
  \ I found my way back to India, this time for a yoga course in Rishikesh and a subsequent\
  \ journey from the spring of the Ganga, in Gangotri, all the way to its most sacred\
  \ stretch, Varanasi, known as Benares. This time, I kept a blog (Namaste. My name\
  \ is Diana Pascu and I am multipolar. I left for India in order to become a yoga\
  \ (Hatha, to begin with) instructor. (https://indhyana.wordpress.com)\nThe writing\
  \ bug was growing big and in 2018 I founded a contemporary Roma magazine, Shukar,\
  \ which is now at its third issue. Being the first project of its kind in Romania,\
  \ we received plenty of media coverage, including radio, TV and other publications.\
  \ We traveled in Roma communities throughout the country and abroad and wrote stories,\
  \ took photos, met people. I gained experience in how to engage with different cultures,\
  \ both developed and individualistic ones like western Europe and the US and less\
  \ technologically developed oriental ones. Thus, I decided I was ready for another\
  \ solo journey of discovery and I spent the last month of 2018 on a fascinating\
  \ and trying journey to Israel and Palestina. Following on the footsteps of the\
  \ Bible authors, which I managed to (partially) read for the first time, I walked\
  \ the gospel trails that cross Haifa, Nazareth, Galilee, The Dead Sea and its Gedis,\
  \ Jericho, one of the oldest human settlement in the world which is now thorn apart\
  \ by human discord, Beersheba, Jerusalem, Bethlehem and of course Hebron, where\
  \ the exit from the Garden of Eden is heavily protected by competing armed forces.\
  \ The journey was an introduction into the middle east and I kept a journal, which\
  \ I use for occasionally releasing travel posts on social media, in order to grow\
  \ the number of visitors that come to my Airbnb in Bucure\u0219ti. Now I am getting\
  \ ready for the prequel to the Israelian journey, which is a month long journey\
  \ into Egypt, following the Nile upstream from Alexandria to Abu Simbel. My interest\
  \ in Egypt started as a child, when I even made an attempt to learn hieroglyphs,\
  \ so I plan to keep a detailed account of this rite of passage up the Nile, followed\
  \ by a direct flight to Amman, Jordan and from there to Petra, the Navataean caravan-city\
  \ inhabited since prehistoric times. Maybe I'll find clues about the caravan-dwellers\
  \ knows as the Roma people, whom are called (abusively, activists believe) 'gypsies'\
  \ because it was thought they origin from Egypt, when in fact they come from India,\
  \ a lost tribe.\nTo Portugal I have been planning to travel since discovering Fernando\
  \ Pessoa, whose existential nihilism denies Lisbon, thus rendering the place all\
  \ the more interesting. Maybe one day I'll reach it, after crossing Europe on foot,\
  \ from Budapest to Santiago de Compostela."
