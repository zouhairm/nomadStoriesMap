Text: "Everyone holds an unforgettable trip in their heart: a city-break to London,\
  \ a shopping spree in New York, or a road trip around the Emerald Isle. A place\
  \ whose wonderous sites are engrained in our minds, and an itching feeling in your\
  \ feet, longing to return to that place which brought you so many happy memories.\
  \ I recently purchased some incense for my meditation: some frankincense, Juniper,\
  \ and white sage to calm my body and focus my mind. But as I got to the cashier,\
  \ a display of Dragon\u2019s Blood caught my eye and rang true in my ears; a strange\
  \ familiarity. I added a box to my purchase and left for home, my scents swishing\
  \ about in my canvas bag along with some fresh notebooks. I had forgotten how scents\
  \ can trigger our sensory memory, like how hot rain on tarmac brings me back to\
  \ a child-like state, skipping around Disney World in pure delight. I lit a stick\
  \ of this Dragon\u2019s Blood, and I instantly got a hit of nostalgia. Suddenly\
  \ I was a fifteen-year-old browsing through nick-nacks and miniature wood carvings\
  \ in an Icelandic store. I could see the ornaments in front of me: three of the\
  \ thirteen trolls of Christmas. Giljagaur (Gully Gawk)\nBj\xFAgnakr\xE6kir (Sausage\
  \ Swiper) and the adorable St\xFAfur (Stubby). Indeed, I don\u2019t think a history\
  \ and folklore so strange and rich as Iceland\u2019s could ever be forgotten, especially\
  \ by a foreigner. We stayed in Iceland for ten days as a Geography studies field\
  \ trip, studying the vast natural phenomena on this volcanic Island. A Hostel in\
  \ Laugarvatn positioned us an hour or so from Reykjavik, by coach, and gave us the\
  \ backdrop of the vast mountains we were to explore. From the Glaciers of Sn\xE6\
  fellsj\xF6kull to touring the Hellisheidi power plant, which uses the island\u2019\
  s geothermic energy to provide clean, free heat and electricity. I absorbed so much\
  \ information in these ten days and gained a fascination for this country which,\
  \ over the last five years, has not left me. I didn\u2019t just travel to Iceland\
  \ to soak in the natural minerals of the Blue Lagoon, or for a photo-op with the\
  \ Aurora Borealis. I discovered a culture, history and a way of living that I found\
  \ difficult to leave behind, boarding the plane home to rainy, drab Belfast. I long\
  \ to return to this quaint fishing island and drive along the smooth, heated roads\
  \ to the many glaciers and waterfalls which decorate the hills. I want to eat in\
  \ Cafe Loki and actually have the stomach to try the delicacy of fermented shark,\
  \ this time. I long to walk through the aisle in Hallgr\xEDmskirkja church, in total\
  \ awe of its magnificent architecture, watching the beautiful organ pipes rise up,\
  \ and above me. I want to visit the National Penis Museum, since it wasn\u2019t\
  \ on my Catholic school\u2019s itinerary. I picture myself exploring the many galleries\
  \ and hand-crafted stores I found, and browsing for hours and hours, and maybe discovering\
  \ that same store I was brought to just this week, with the smell of Dragon\u2019\
  s Blood."
