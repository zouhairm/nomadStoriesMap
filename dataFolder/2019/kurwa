Text: "It was a scorching summer in Eastern Europe and I was in Poland both to visit\
  \ the place and to do a little research about synagogues in Warsaw in order to find\
  \ out about the lives of my grandparents that had ran away from the Holocaust and\
  \ moved to Brazil. Taking a break from this task, I switched to a more pleasant\
  \ one: a pub-crawl. It was there that I met a cute Swedish primary teacher and began\
  \ a brief, yet intense, summer affair that lasted a couple of days, as I had booked\
  \ nights in Lviv, Ukraine, before meeting her, and she did the same but for Krakow.\
  \ So, after an afternoon full of passion and being shamefully caught by her friends\
  \ while at it which I rather not detail so much; I finally went to Ukraine.\n\n\
  As the space here is short and so was my experience in Lviv, I won\u2019t detail\
  \ it much. It is important to notice, though, that Eastern Ukraine was at war. Even\
  \ though Lviv was pretty far away from the Crimea region, I was still a bit scared\
  \ of going there. Yet, I went anyway, unable to take my head off my sweet Swedish\
  \ girl. Which, yes, may sound like a creep, as I barely knew her, but still.\n\n\
  After a couple of days at Lviv it was time to embark for Cluj-Napoca, as I had to\
  \ be on Corfu in around a week and was still pretty far away. I innocently got the\
  \ bus, unaware of the surprise that was expecting me. After a couple of hours inside\
  \ it, I noticed we weren\u2019t exactly going south. It was not Kansas \nanymore.\n\
  \nThey use the Cyrillic alphabet in Ukraine. I have absolutely no freaking idea\
  \ of how to read the cyrillic alphabet. Therefore, I have bought my bus ticket pretty\
  \ much based on trust, considering that the cashier could barely speak English.\
  \ Still, I checked both on my hostel and with the bus driver and they both confirmed\
  \ that my ticket was correct, so I\u2019m not quite sure how exactly what happened,\
  \ happened. My main theory is that the hour of depart was set for 10 P.M., while\
  \ I took the bus at 10 A.M. Yes, reader, as you already may have guessed, I took\
  \ the wrong bus.\n\nWith barely anyone speaking any language other than Polish or\
  \ Ukrainian, I have only to be grateful that the bus, with all of it flaws, somehow\
  \ had Wi-Fi, which allowed me to realize that something was wrong since I was going\
  \ west and, by that point, near Poland\u2019s border. The thoughts of going somewhere\
  \ unknown in a country at war made me sort of panic a little bit. Somehow, I managed\
  \ to find an English-speaker that made me calmer by informing me that I was heading\
  \ to Krakow. \n\nCalm is, perhaps, a strong word. I was still in a foreign land,\
  \ alone, going somewhere that was not part of my plans, and therefore losing the\
  \ reservation I\u2019ve made on a hostel at Cluj-napoca, as well as having to find\
  \ one at Krakow. It happens, though, that the cute Swedish girl actually went to\
  \ Krakow after we had left from Warsaw, as I said on the beginning. I\u2019ve had\
  \ no idea if she was still there, and it would be a bit complicated to make her\
  \ believe in the truth rather than that I was a random creepy stalker, however I\
  \ had nothing to lose so it was worth the shot. For my astonishment, she not only\
  \ believed but also invited me to stay together at the house she was renting. For\
  \ free.\n\nI\u2019m well aware of psychoanalysis theories of the unconscious to\
  \ perceive that this Freudian slip was convenient enough. Nevertheless, I swear\
  \ to you, reader, at least as far as my conscience go, I was trying to get to Romenia.\
  \ Well, I suppose it was for the best. And do you wanna know what happened to the\
  \ Swedish cute girl? Well, I\u2019m married to her nowadays. Just kidding, I have\
  \ actually never seen her again once I left Krakow. Kurwa."
