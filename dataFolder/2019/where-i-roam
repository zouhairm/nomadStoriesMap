Text: "Where I Roam\n\nBy Yael Amouyal\n\n\n\nThe unknown - for some an idea they\
  \ lust after, to have that adrenaline coursing through every muscle. I have taken\
  \ these leaps. I set up a tent in the bottom of Lucerne, Swiss Alps. Hiking fifteen\
  \ kilometers a day with thirteen kilos on my back. I\u2019ve spent windy nights\
  \ singing myself to sleep, ignoring the sounds of animals, trees, and creaking that\
  \ sends shrills of terror down my spine. I\u2019ve woken up to the sun inviting\
  \ me to jump into glacial waters. No reason to part my lips and share my journey.\
  \ Fast forward, I have climbed, trekked, fallen, and arrived at Zermatt. Temperatures\
  \ are dropping. I must feel the separation. Separation from societal norms. Continuously\
  \ taking apart and setting up my two pole, single, green mesh tent. Days go by and\
  \ time begins to blend. I have yet to speak, for there is no reason to. I cracked.\
  \ Taking showers with the swans. Eating lunches with the heron. I\u2019ve broken\
  \ my spirit with solitude and isolation. This unknown, this thrill I am familiar\
  \ with.\n\nOthers continue to seek the misunderstood, the unidentifiable. I have\
  \ felt the harsh jagged cold serrated edge of three pistols jabbing into my back,\
  \ rib cage, and chest in a repeatedly almost melodic like bashing. Up against the\
  \ cool soil of corruption. Being told I\u2019ll be executed in the morning. Being\
  \ told \u201Cshut up girl! \u201Cevery time I explain. Hands in cuffs, legs in cuffs,\
  \ strapped to a chair. Stuck in a Cambodian mud pit they call \u201Cjail.\u201D\
  \ Do I offer money right away, do I try to bribe them? When they spit on me, should\
  \ I react? Reading faces, studying body language, knowing my own strength, is finally\
  \ handy. They want six hundred dollars, but I only have two hundred on me. They\
  \ want me to be weak, cry, breakdown show them the fear all white people carry.\
  \ I did nothing. I did not quiver, shake, nor cry. Sunrise approaches. They share\
  \ concerned glances. Their faces screaming when will she crack. I make eye contact\
  \ and say \u201Cmoney,\u201D he says, wearing a military green army uniform, carrying\
  \ a military pistol, smoking his military cigar, \u201CUS Money.\u201D\n\nI say\
  \ \u201CYes\u201D\n\n-       \u201C600\u201D\n\n-       \u201C200\u201D\n\n-   \
  \    \u201CNo\u201D\n\nI repeat \u201C200.\u201D\n\nSilence. Laughter. Pointing.\
  \ Rats running along my shoulder. Cockroaches making a home on my feet. Click, clank,\
  \ crink. I am free. I am free and I now know the feeling of buying your freedom.\n\
  \nSomehow amongst all the roaming I have carried myself through. Recalling the first\
  \ time I went on a solo trip, that first journey alone, standing in a Lisbon train\
  \ station wondering, how will I ever learn to read a map. Those unknown feelings\
  \ have led me to more than thirty-seven countries, led me to shed all that I can\
  \ on the road. A place I wish I could be constantly. My biggest leap into the unknown.\
  \ My biggest fear. Sitting here on this couch, forever contemplating. Forever trying\
  \ to motivate myself to be better, do bigger. The uncomfortableness of shifting\
  \ my life, not knowing which passion is the right passion. Not knowing where my\
  \ feet will lead me. Concocting another excuse to stray further from my unknown\
  \ purpose. The familiarity of the road warms my soul. The familiarity of getting\
  \ lost in new lands, of not caring because it isn\u2019t my home, of no one knowing\
  \ my name. Allowing myself to be a true full throttle self. Just like a shooting\
  \ star, the wonders, excitement, wishes of abundance, all gone in a flash. Paralyzed,\
  \ smoking spliff after spliff gazing through moss-covered windows. Contemplating\
  \ my unknown. My future. Thinking of the vastness I have yet to comprehend scares\
  \ me more than pistols. More than solitude. I wouldn\u2019t mind this if I only\
  \ knew my end goal. Where these long and winding roads lead. If only that introspective\
  \ journey were like the projections we all carry. Disconnected and beautiful. If\
  \ only I had answers. If only someone did. It seems the unknown burden I carry is\
  \ ME."
