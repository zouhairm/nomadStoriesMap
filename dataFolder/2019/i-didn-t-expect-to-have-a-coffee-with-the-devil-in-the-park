Text: "Recently I travelled to Madrid. I was staying in Lisbon at the time, so it\
  \ seemed reasonable to take a 10-hour long nap in a bus and roll out afterwards\
  \ with no plan in my second favourite capital at the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAs much\
  \ as I usually don`t prefer going to green areas or parks due to my childhood traumas\
  \ caused by growing up in the countryside, at one point I found myself in the middle\
  \ of Retiro park. After visiting a book market known for its famous Madrid Book\
  \ Fair that is being held there in May, I really needed a coffee. My GPS told me\
  \ the closest one I will find is in the park, and my sugar-in-blood level told me\
  \ there is no way around it. So I went.\_\n\nFunny fact \u2013 it turned out the\
  \ park is so huge I just might find GPS handy there, and also I might find the only\
  \ sculpture in the world dedicated to the devil there. Curiously enough, the sculpture\
  \ sits 666m above sea level. Curiously even more \u2013 I couldn`t find it. I can\
  \ tell you this in advance \u2013 if you try to type it in Google Maps, you will\
  \ see a photo of an underground window 1,5miles away. It might be someone`s hell,\
  \ but keep looking, that is not it.\_\n\nI didn't keep looking. Instead, I sat in\
  \ my coffee place and ordered my coffee with milk, when suddenly I spot it right\
  \ in front of me (how did I manage to miss that?). Fallen Angel fell just in front\
  \ of the coffee place, near the Rose Garden, in the middle of the park. Apparently\
  \ one of the most controversial monuments in Spain with an interesting history,\
  \ it was built in the year 1877 by Spanish sculptor Ricardo Bellver, inspired by\
  \ John Milton`s epic poem Paradise Lost that depicts Lucifer falling from Heaven.\
  \ Although it was a big scandal, it was also a big success at the Spanish national\
  \ Fine Arts Exhibition and at the third Paris World`s Fair (1878). A few years later,\
  \ the sculpture was released to The City of Madrid and now let alone for being observed\
  \ by passengers while it stands on its fountain, unsurprisingly being called Fountain\
  \ of the Fallen Angel.\n\nSo there I was, having my coffee 666m above sea level\
  \ (rough estimation) staring at this one of a kind statue with a trace of disbelief\
  \ on my face. Maybe I am a park person after all?\_\n\nSo I googled it just a bit.\
  \ Facts: I had been sitting surrounded by 15000 trees (welcome back my childhood),\
  \ the Large Lake (boating activities), the Velazques Palace and the Glass Palace\
  \ (exhibition venues), Puppet theatre, many monuments and a botanical paradise,\
  \ including the oldest tree in Madrid \"Ahuehuete\" or \"Montezuma Cypress\" that\
  \ has not moved from there since 1630.\_ You could spend a whole day in there with\
  \ no problem. Moved by having a coffee in the company of a Fallen Angel and my broken\
  \ idea of a park being the last place I would like to go, I just ordered another\
  \ cup of coffee. What the hell."
