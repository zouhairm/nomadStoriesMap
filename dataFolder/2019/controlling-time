Text: "7am. Train Station. Life starts relatively early here. Hot. Windy. It's May.\
  \ Crowd. Queues. Normal here. This is scenery you see every day when you live in\
  \ the most populous city in the world. This is Shanghai and more generally, this\
  \ is China. You always feel overwhelmed by something, either the huge skyscrapers\
  \ hanging over your head or the tons of people everywhere at any time of the day\
  \ and the night or the time that seems unstoppable and irredeemably fast.\nSo why\
  \ am I in a station now? For me, a countryside girl who moved to this metropolis\
  \ this life sometimes is too much. So I decided I needed a break from the busyness,\
  \  to check out and discover some new places.\nI got on a train to Hangzhou, a city\
  \ just half an hour away from Shanghai. But, what I would have never expected, was\
  \ what kind of travel that train was actually taking me on. It felt like a travel\
  \ time. When I got of the train and the subway and I finally got to see the sky,\
  \ it was somehow new, fresher and deeper. There was no smog in that sky, no fog\
  \ or coulds covering it. While walking to reach the most famous spot in the city,\
  \ the air I was breathing felt different, and when I reached the place I was heading\
  \ to, I understood what was that about. From furistic technology, the tallest skyscrapers\
  \ and most modern life, I was back in ancient China. That train had taken me to\
  \ the most peaceful place my soul has ever felt.\nJust under that deep blue sky,\
  \ where some incredibly white clouds were embedded, green hills layed silently on\
  \ the border of the huge lake that stood in the middle of that place circling it\
  \ all along.\nCherry trees with cherry blossoms were filling the slopes of the hills,\
  \ going up to the top of them, where some astonishing pagodas and temples where\
  \ standing. The lake was bathed is the same blue color as the sky, seeming that\
  \ they were part of the same thing, just divided by the sinuous line if the hills.\
  \ Hundreds of little yellow and red wooden boats were quietly and slowly sailing\
  \ in the middle of the lake. Every place, every person was bathed in the soft sunlight\
  \ and cooled down by the delicate wind. \nNo one was in a hurry there, no one seemed\
  \ to have to go anywhere, we were just enjoying that soul restoring place all together.\
  \ \nThat's how, escaping one day from the speed and the busy metropolitan life that\
  \ seems to always take your time away, the way to stop it."
