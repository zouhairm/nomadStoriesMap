Text: "I\u2019m not sure how to begin my story, it was like a dream come true. I\u2019\
  ve been in love with the contry, Seoul since i was 15. The first moment i heard\
  \ Korean song, the language sounds so unfamiliar in my ears. But through the years,\
  \ i listen to Korean songs more than anything, that i\u2019m getting more fluent\
  \ in Korean day by day.\nSo, i always wanted to go to Seoul since i was young, but\
  \ i just don\u2019t know how to tell my parents that, they won\u2019t allow me,\
  \ i\u2019m sure.\nOne day in 2015, i found a best friend with the same passion as\
  \ mine, i really enjoy talking to her that we eventually share the same dream too,\
  \ \u201CGo to Seoul\u201D. We end up found the coolest way by doing some research,\
  \ for competition that will be held in Seoul, we didn\u2019t have enough time but\
  \ we eventually tried our best. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t make it. Our research\
  \ was still lack in so many aspects, the rejection was inevitable.\nThe next year,\
  \ we didn\u2019t really expect anything. After doing our last task before we graduated\
  \ from university, we eventually submitted another reasearch and paper to the same\
  \ competition. We didn\u2019t expect much, really. But unknowingly, when the notice\
  \ came, we\u2019re surprise because our reaserch and paper is accepted.\nIt was\
  \ unbelievable. We rush to get our passport renewed and got our visas. \nThings\
  \ are happened in the blink of an eye, we\u2019re arrived in Seoul. Even before\
  \ our plane is landed, i\u2019m getting all the goosebumps from watching Seoul from\
  \ above. The timing was right, a song called \u201CView\u201D by SHINee, one of\
  \ Korean Poupular Group was playing, it\u2019s matched the atmosphere so well. I\
  \ got too emotional.\nThe next day we visit the infamous Gyeongbokgung Palace, it\
  \ was beautiful, but it was really hot. We went the on summer though. But i love\
  \ it so much, even when we were only sitting on the subway and watch the people\
  \ doing their stuff, it\u2019s pretty much familiar. I\u2019ve watched a lot Korean\
  \ drama and shows, there\u2019s this drink called, Banana Milk. On our first day,\
  \ we went to a convinent store to bought that, it was hella delicious. Even the\
  \ smell of it was delicious hehe. We went to Namsan Tower too, i remember meeting\
  \ a nice grandpa, he was taking an old camera with him. He nudges me and politely\
  \ asking if i can help him to take his pictures for him. I excitedly said yes. That\
  \ was my first time directly using Koreang language with the local and we communicate\
  \ pretty well. I take some pictures of him and he looks pretty satisfied. I don\u2019\
  t really ask him why he came up alone.\nThen we went to Myeongdong, there are a\
  \ lot of stores, fashion, make up, street food, basically everything. In Korean\
  \ street, we can mostly found a store that sells cute shocks, the shocks were really\
  \ cute, the have all the characters and cute models, the owner uncle of the stores\
  \ ask me \u201CAre you Korean?\u201D Because i keep using Korean to him, and i heard\
  \ that a lot since i was you that i look a lot like Korean. I was surprise and told\
  \ him no. He asked me how did i learn Korean, i told him it was because of the dramas\
  \ and the songs.\nOn the night, we bought ourself good and delicious Korean street\
  \ food, he fish shapped cake, it was delicious. The owner gave us a freebie. We\
  \ also bought spicy rice cake and fish cake with soup. The portion was generous\
  \ and the owner was nice too.\nSeoul was so friendly, just like how i saw t from\
  \ the movie. My another to friends wore hijab, Korean respect the so much. They\
  \ greet them politely, they doing all the polite gesture with them, one thing that\
  \ left deep impression to me was on one morning, we passed by a group of drunk youngster,\
  \ their faces was still red, but the eventually stop and bow to us with the polite\
  \ gesture while saying \u201CSalaam\u201D and smile to us warmly, they went away\
  \ shortly after that."
