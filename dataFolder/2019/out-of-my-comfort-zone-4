Text: "Tired after an overnight train ride from Agra and shivering in the misty dawn\
  \ air, I waited for a tuk-tuk to take me from Jaipur\u2019s train station to my\
  \ guest house. A homeless woman approached me with a cup of tea in one hand, the\
  \ other outstretched, palm up. I didn\u2019t want the drink she offered, so I thanked\
  \ her then turned away. Angry, she slapped my luggage and threw the tea in my face;\
  \ forcing me out of my comfort zone. Minutes later, I climbed into the back of a\
  \ three-wheeled rickshaw and placed my bags on the rear bench seat. Shaken, I handed\
  \ a sheet of paper with an address to the driver then he peddled us away.\n\nAt\
  \ my whitewashed lodging, I was ushered under a tall elephant-size gate through\
  \ the courtyard and into a tiny room with four chairs. As soon as I was seated,\
  \ a young woman, no more than twenty, brought me hot chai tea and honeyed sesame\
  \ wafers on a tray. The warm drink calmed me down a bit, but I couldn\u2019t stop\
  \ chastising myself for not giving the homeless woman a few coins.\n\n\u201CThe\
  \ tea and biscuits are delicious,\u201D I said, still dazed, as the woman gathered\
  \ my plate and cup. She threw her long black braid behind her back and gave me a\
  \ hesitant smile, then left.  I continued to sit in the windowless room as they\
  \ readied my sleeping quarters, and half-heartedly studied the intricately carved\
  \ Hindu trinkets and vibrant cloth wall hangings that decorated the small room.\
  \  When my suite was ready, the woman led me down the narrow corridor to the last\
  \ door on the right, then handed me the key.\n\n\u201CIf you like, I can teach you\
  \ how to make chai tea and show you how we cook our food,\u201D she offered, in\
  \ limited English, head downturned. \nI hadn\u2019t thought of taking an Indian\
  \ cooking class, but I didn\u2019t have any plans, and cooking happened to be one\
  \ of my hobbies. I nodded my head and said, \u201CYes, I\u2019d like that\u2026\u201D\
  \ and trailed off, not knowing how to address her. \u201CMy name\u2019s Barbara,\
  \ and you\u2019re?\u201D\n\n\u201CTeena,\u201D she answered then hurried away.\n\
  \nThat evening, at seventeen hundred hours, I was taken to a ten-foot by ten-foot\
  \ concrete block structure separated from the other buildings. Inside, the only\
  \ kitchen equipment I saw was a two burner cook plate, much like a camp stove, and\
  \ a sink. Above, on a wood shelf that rimmed the perimeter of the room, pots, pans,\
  \ and foodstuff were stored, three feet above the concrete cooking counter.\n\n\u201C\
  Here,\u201D Teena said, giving me a knife and pointing towards an onion she had\
  \ laid out on a wood block. \n\nAs I began chopping, she hopped up on the counter,\
  \ barefooted, and pulled down lentils, rice, potatoes, cauliflower, and bags full\
  \ of colorful spices: brown cumin, yellow turmeric, black peppercorn. Once she had\
  \ all the ingredients and utensils she needed, she hopped back down to the dirt\
  \ floor, not bothering to wash off the counter where her bare feet had trod. \n\n\
  \u201CDo you do all the cooking for your family?\u201D I asked, watching as she\
  \ arranged the food in piles on the counter.\n\n\u201CI must learn how to cook and\
  \ clean if I am to get married,\u201D she told me. Then she placed the pressure\
  \ cooker on the hot plate. \u201CI must be able to prove to my mother-in-law that\
  \ I can be a good wife.\u201D\n\n\u201CAre you betrothed?\u201D I asked, expecting\
  \ her to spill over with a love story.\n\n\u201CNo,\u201D she whispered. \u201C\
  There was a boy at school. He wasn\u2019t actually my boyfriend, but I liked him,\
  \ and I could tell by the way he smiled at me, he liked me, too. He was Muslim,\u201D\
  \ she said and looked at me expectantly. \u201CWe\u2019re Hindu. My parents would\
  \ not like him.\u201D \n\nI cringed inside, feeling her frustration.\n\nShe continued\
  \ to prepare the meal, not talking, and not assigning me any more tasks. When the\
  \ meal was ready, we brought the lentil soup, spiced rice, \ncauliflower with potatoes,\
  \ and chapati to her family\u2019s one-room living quarters. There we sat on rugs\
  \ and ate, companionably."
