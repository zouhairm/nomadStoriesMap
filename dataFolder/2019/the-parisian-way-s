Text: "\u201CIf you meet people in your building but they don\u2019t greet you outside,\
  \ don\u2019t take offense, that\u2019s just the Parisian way.\u201D\n\nThese were\
  \ my new landlord\u2019s parting words of advice as he handed me the key to my very\
  \ own, teeny tiny, walk up studio on a quiet street off the tourist-ridden, ice\
  \ cream-slinging Rue Saint-Louis en I\u2019\xCEle. Never mind that I was still panting\
  \ from climbing seven flights of stairs while eyeing crumbling wall paper and suspect\
  \ drips from a ceiling I couldn\u2019t quite make out thanks to a permanent, lingering\
  \ cloud of cigarette smoke. Hell, I\u2019m sure someone like Hemmingway lived in\
  \ this building back in the day and they just didn\u2019t want to alter the integrity\
  \ of such a historical monument. Yeah, that was it. That would also explain why\
  \ I had to share a small toilet with four other apartments, eloquently placed directly\
  \ on the other side of the wall where my head would lay to rest each night. But\
  \ on Sunday mornings, these intimate noises of concern would be drowned out by the\
  \ wafting melody of the bells at Notre Dame- THE Notre Dame. I could roll with it.\n\
  \nIt had only been a week, and I was getting really good at facilitating these internal\
  \ dialogues to remind myself that I could, in fact, roll with it. When I arrived\
  \ straight from the airport to discover the room I thought I\u2019d secured through\
  \ a mutual connection was already rented. When I ended up spending the first few\
  \ nights in a cheap hotel with a group of sheiks in high heels trying to gain a\
  \ Twitter following via Paris Fashion Week. Even when I was two hours late to my\
  \ teacher orientation as the University of Versailles because my train \u201Cest\
  \ supprim\xE9.\u201D I spoke a little conversational French, but \u201Csupprimer\u201D\
  \ was not yet in my vocabulary when I saw it flashing in red on the train queue.\
  \ Google translate then told me my train \u201Cwas deleted or abolished.\u201D Dramatic,\
  \ much? \n\nI had moved abroad before, and knew that those first few weeks of discomfort\
  \ and chaos were meant to be laughed at and learned from. But this time it felt\
  \ different- lonelier. During past stints in South America, I had strangers offering\
  \ to walk me home from the bus stop just to make sure I made it safely, but here\
  \ I couldn\u2019t even manage to score some eye contact on the metro. One week without\
  \ meaningful human connection was far more taxing than my seventh floor walkup and\
  \ deleted trained combined. \n\nAfter my landlord left, I decided to go for a run,\
  \ eager to clear my head and explore my new neighborhood. As I walked through our\
  \ courtyard, a little old man enveloped by a massive fur coat was checking his mail\
  \ while chiding his three fluffy dogs in tow, and I smiled and offered a soft \u201C\
  Bonjour,\u201D which he returned. I have a new French apartment and I just said\
  \ hello to my stylish French neighbor- what a day to be alive! My loneliness morphed\
  \ into a temporary sense of accomplishment that gave me the courage to explore a\
  \ nearby market after cleaning up from my run. I managed to track down some cooking\
  \ essentials, feeling equally hungry and triumphant as I headed to check out, reaching\
  \ for a bottle of (self) congratulatory champagne along the way. That\u2019s when\
  \ I came to an immediate halt, recognizing the fur coat and three poof balls staring\
  \ back at me in line. My new neighbor was in front of me, and all I could do was\
  \ panic. We were outside our apartments, in the great unknown world of social cues\
  \ called Paris, and I didn\u2019t want to screw it up. Do I smile? Do I ignore him\
  \ entirely? Do I pet his dogs? Do French people pet dogs? I knew I was spiraling,\
  \ yet couldn\u2019t stop myself. The loneliness crept back up into my jet lagged\
  \ brain, and I decided that maybe this was all too much to navigate alone. But then,\
  \ a simple five words reminded me that I wasn\u2019t. Five words as warm as the\
  \ coat adorning the man that spoke them: \u201CMademoiselle, welcome to the neighborhood.\u201D"
