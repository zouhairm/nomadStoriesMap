Text: "When I was 14 years old as one of the residents of Benghazi city, my interest\
  \ in nature and travelling to visit new places and meet new people increased. My\
  \ obsession to the idea of travelling from one city to another had increased day\
  \ by day. In 1992 I have visited many towns around my city and I walked and camped\
  \ and every time I met new people and contacted with them. I was travelling for\
  \ four years which provide me with the experience in using the travelling equipment\
  \ like the shoes and another camping stuff.  At that time the network service was\
  \ not available in my country and no camping books were available, so I depended\
  \ on my own experience trying to live in nature. \nDuring these four years I have\
  \ visited different areas of Libya. I had learnt to live in many different conditions\
  \ in the desert, mountains and cost cities as well the multiculturalism and climate\
  \ variabilities helped me a lot. I understood the demographic composition and the\
  \ multiculturalism of Libya which help me a lot in presenting my country culture\
  \ to the world during my 10 years of travelling around the world.\nDuring my journey\
  \ in Libya I was obsessed with the idea of visiting the Mediterranean sea countries,\
  \ I started looking for a big colorful map to start planning for my next journey\
  \ unfortunately I could not find any one in my city. I remembered that in my school\
  \ there was a big map on the wall like the one I was looking for, but I could not\
  \ have it so I stole it. I hanged it on my room wall and I kept on staring at it\
  \ as I can see my dreams come true. Among all the negativity I was surrounded with\
  \ and my fears from what is coming, my map made the strongest support to me, especially\
  \ when people started talking about me like the weird mad man who  wants to travel\
  \ the world on feet. In 1996 one day in the morning I had returned the map to the\
  \ school and tore the world map paper from a geography book, I said goodbye to my\
  \ family and I could not forgot my mum tears on her cheeks. They all could not believe\
  \ that I'm only 18 years old and I'm leaving with only 200 dollars in my pocket\
  \ and one bag on my shoulders. I was really young.\nI'm Omar Attera, from Libya,\
  \ I have visited about 115 countries in the three continents around the world. I\
  \ had learnt the African, European and Asian cultures in 10 years of my journey,\
  \ I had communicated with Maasai and Zulu tribes in Africa, and I had tried the\
  \ Catha edulis in Mukalla, Sada'a and Taiz. Also I had drunk the tea in sheba and\
  \ I had hugged the clouds on mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. I also had visited all\
  \ the European countries and I like to share my experience with the world."
