Text: "My  Unplanned trip to Capetown was really Exciting and just full of Surprises\
  \ and discoveries I never thought I had in me.\nI remember becoming super active\
  \ After getting my fitbit watch then later on discovering this amazing place in\
  \ FishHoek Capetown that looks like a glimpse of Heaven.\n\ni was in Capetown with\
  \ my sisters from the 31st of December until the 7th of January, the I Decided to\
  \ spend one more day in Capetown and \u201C Return\u201D on the 08th, little did\
  \ I know I would fall into a system of Sex, drugs & alcohol all in the name of God.\
  \ \n\nCutting a ling story short , Jesus saved me and I found myself in Hospital,\
  \ I guess it\u2019s better than the mortuary. I\u2019m a new creature in Christ,\
  \ I\u2019ve got supernatural powers, I can think, act and just live fast but not\
  \ get influenced, im on my way to leading a life full of miracles. I feel like the\
  \ chosen, I feel like God lives in Capetown but visits us from time to time. All\
  \ in prayer. I feel like I\u2019ve met God. I feel like I\u2019ve met Angels.\n\n\
  I\u2019ve since hiked the table mountain \u26F0 , the 7th wonder of the world, and\
  \ I would do it again. It\u2019s an amazing experience, i need to take my family\
  \ with me some day. Life is really what you make of it. It\u2019s not a box of chocolates,\
  \ life is the Box of chocololates you package yourself. You know exactly what inside\
  \ the box but you still get surprised when you open the box. \n\nRemeber to Meditate,\
  \ Eat well, rest , exercise, make time for Family & Friends. Be happy under any\
  \ circumstance. Remember its only temporary."
