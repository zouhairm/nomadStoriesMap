Text: I have been in portugal before. I was like 16 or less when i joined a traditional
  dance group from Indonesia. I was literally the youngest of the group. I went there
  for around 20 days and really enjoyed the magnificent Lisbon and other few cities
  thanks to the Embassy of Indonesia in Lisbon and my dance group director. I didnt
  have enough money to get myself a digicam to take picts of myself not even a camera
  phone. So for days i spent there chat and joke around with other locals and tourists
  in a hostel called Yes! And i was having a blast time like it was an eye opening
  experience for a countrified poor girl from far away who never been to anywhere
  except her home country before. I almost knew every street around the hostel and
  knew some of the local shop owners and they were so friendly. About the scenery..i
  still cannot find any other places that can beat the look of Portugal. Portugal
  which i hope to be the sacred place for me to get marry one day. And i mentioned
  about 'i was a fool', well more like i was unlucky because i didnt get the chance
  to capture any photos of myself because i didnt have a camera. When you were the
  youngest, didnt have any camera and had the most selfish seniors on earth well i
  had to take all the picts for them exclude myself. I just want to have that second
  chance to make happy memories for my grandkis to tell, well i wish so. Thanks for
  reading my story guys. I hope the winners are the ones who truly deserve this travel.
  Thanks for lighting up my day and make reminsicing my wonderful Portugal memories.
