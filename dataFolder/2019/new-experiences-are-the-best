Text: "Unknown, to me, is something worth looking for, because the whole idea of \u200B\
  \u200Bsomething new and uncertain is invigorating and enthralling. Despite the title,\
  \ I did not jump into the unknown, actually, I dive in into the unknown. I really\
  \ like to travel, but because I live in a coastal state I had only traveled to cities\
  \ in my state. A few months ago I decided to make the trip I hoped for did, but\
  \ only because something forced me to do it. I live in the northeastern region of\
  \ Brazil and I went to do a test in the south region (without it I would have probably\
  \ taken a few months to go since I was expecting to do 20 years). What is unknown\
  \ about this? For some, it is just a common journey, for me, a way to break up and\
  \ venture into the unknown, since I had never traveled by plane before, let alone\
  \ alone. Yes, when I was 19, I only made the famous family trips by car.\nA new\
  \ region, despite being in the same country, new customs, different foods and different\
  \ attitudes. Many different things, my aunt had already warned me of the differences\
  \ and I thought it would not be too difficult. I confess that on my first day in\
  \ another state I was a bit unmotivated, because I wanted to know everything, but\
  \ it was Sunday and many places were closed. Then I went to a belvedere (where I\
  \ could see the whole city) and I was thinking about how to visit each tourist place\
  \ or just walk out and find out where I was going to get. But on my second day,\
  \ I decided to explore the city, where I started to walk, to talk to some local\
  \ people about their traditions, local merchants, most of them gentle people who\
  \ spoke a little about the city, about the European-style architecture and its cuisine\
  \ different from the northeast. All right until then. I continued to walk around\
  \ the city, did not want to take a taxi and wanted to buy some souvenirs, until\
  \ I got lost. The city was so pleasant, I was watching the cathedral, museum (unfortunately\
  \ I could not enter because it was closed), and I did not know where it was. I asked\
  \ a few merchants for information and went to a gift shop where to get there I had\
  \ to walk a few more kilometers. After shopping, as unfortunately I was with a lot\
  \ of things and my feet were hurting enough to walk a lot (little more than 4 kilometers),\
  \ I had to call an uber and I ended up finding that I was literally on the other\
  \ side of the city.\nWhat for some may just be another trip, for me was an enriching\
  \ experience, addressing things that I have never done before, especially traveling\
  \ alone. Why did a leap into the unknown end up being so important? Having the experience\
  \ of traveling alone, you discover and do things you normally would never do. You\
  \ learn to have a little more responsibility, because if you have an appointment\
  \ you need to arrive on time, this already counts from the time of taking the flight,\
  \ you try out new meetings, because at some point you will have to talk to someone,\
  \ and best part, at least for me, was the cooking, where you will have to detach\
  \ from your mother's food and eat what is in the local cuisine.\n\_The unknown is\
  \ present in our lives in many ways, because every day we have to face something\
  \ new and many times that we have not seen before, it is up to you to know how to\
  \ deal with the unknown, making it better your experience and make you stronger,\
  \ or just make you give up and settle down without running after what you really\
  \ want."
