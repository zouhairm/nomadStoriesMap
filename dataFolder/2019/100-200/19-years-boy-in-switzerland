Text: Being a 19 years old boy ,who went to the beautiful country of the world with
  friends. He speaks little bit of French and German, who doesn't know much about
  the country,there culture etc but he wants to travel to Switzerland because from
  his childhood he saw many Bollywood films being picturized there . The day whenhe
  landed on the runway in Zurich airport it was snowing , that was his biggest memorable
  time of there. Stayed there for 15 days ,went to Interlaken,Bern,Geneva and many
  other amazing places. Coming back from discos around 5:00am and eating Swiss chocolates
  will be always remembered. This is my story - Manik kakra from india
