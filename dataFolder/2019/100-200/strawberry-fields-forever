Text: Baguio City, Philippines is the nation's summer capital more than a thousand
  feet above sea level. Famous for its strawberry farms, I didn't expect to find that
  the inhabitants are able to grow this popular berry known for its sweetness and
  tender flavor one can find in our country. Different strawberry products are sold
  into fruit jams, preserves, syrups among others. Although these berries found their
  way too in an undisclosed location, Cantipla, in the City of Cebu where local farmers
  have also cultivated this red fruit crop. Getting one of these in the supermarket
  has found its way in this local farm.
