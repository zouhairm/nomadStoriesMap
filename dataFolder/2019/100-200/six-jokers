Text: The journey is going to learn something to learnBut some travels leave a question
  behind it, a question whose answer is neither we nor it is near God.One such question
  was in front of meThis journey is also known as normal trips, to gain knowledge
  and enjoy.Travel 6 friends who were completely different from each other.If someone
  was like Ravana then someone like Amol Palekar.There was no Haryana roadways then
  no Rajasthan roadways.But still we were all one.Is full of pages of memories, life
  is a puzzle of happiness and sadness. If we  sitting alone, then life   is incomplete
  without faith.Our question was with God what was his house humans heart or building
  .
