Text: A Portuguese girl wins the trip of her dreams to travel back to her heritage
  for fourteen days. Not only does she get to explore her family heritage, this young
  aspiring writer gets to attend workshops and receive knowledge on writing that she
  has been aspiring to be engaged with all her life. Imagine attending a 4-day workshop
  with Tim Neville and receiving a portfolio review from Norie Quintos in Portugal?
  Yeah, well that's this lucky girls life! Being surrounded by the beautiful weather,
  the glorious sights, the Portuguese language, the culture itself, the food and drinks,
  the writing blog and pieces she had been indulging in were finally starting to come
  together and her career as a young writer was finally looking promising. She made
  connections, got properly mentored and felt inspired to continue working towards
  her dreams while taking pictures and capturing moments that she could only dream
  that she could be apart of all thanks to World Nomads 2019 Writing Scholarship.
