Text: Taking things for granted is a national past time.  No one even bothers to question
  whether or not a bicycle can replace a horse because no one takes either seriously.  Horses
  are for dilettantes and poseurs. Bicycles are for fitness nerds, hippies, or Luddites.
  1896, however, the question was asked, pondered, and an answer was attempted. Buffalo
  Soldiers (a ambiguously racist term for African-American army members) were given
  the task of answering the question by taking bicycles on a 1900 mile trek between
  Missoula, MT and St Louis, MO. It's a crazy long trek by today's standards and near
  impossible in 1896. But it got done.  Can that epic journey be recreated? Why should
  anyone try?  The only excuse would be to honor the memory of soldiers who accomplished
  the impossible and were promptly forgotten.
