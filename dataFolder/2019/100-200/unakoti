Text: "Once me and my two friends decided to travel a historical place only for 1\
  \ night and 1 day in Unakoti, situated in North Tripura, India. We packed up our\
  \ luggages and our journey was approx 3-4 hours. That place is really a beautiful\
  \ place with some amazing carved stone statues of god's on the hills. And all the\
  \ scenery was based on hills and jungles but the inner of that place is nothing\
  \ less than the golden age of old civilization. Some monks lives in that jungle\
  \ and drink the water which comes from an unknown source of top of the hill. And\
  \ we visited a site also where there is a pond situated and this was full of Lotus\
  \ flowers. So overall our travel was more satisfying and successful.\n   Thanks.\
