Text: "It\u2019s about 2 months ago .. i got a chance to explore Manali . The experience\
  \ was freaking awesome. I am not still getting out of that experience. \nWe were\
  \ three friends. We went there in the month of January . We pre booked the car for\
  \ travelling there . From Delhi, it\u2019s 8hr way by bus to Manali. If you want\
  \ to enjoy the scenery you must go by bus. \nWe went shalong valley , waterfalls\
  \ , hadimba temple , rohtang pass , monestry etc . \nExperience was damn good .\
  \ The people we met were awsome. Locals were soo supportive . \nI can\u2019t describe\
  \ it in words \n\nMeanwhile adventure is worthwhile \u2764\uFE0F"
