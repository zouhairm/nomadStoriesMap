Text: 'I was born and raised in a small village located in the outskirts of KwaZulu
  Natal, South Africa. Life was only what existed inside the margines of my village,
  no one imagined a world beyond.


  I met two exhange students from the UK while I was still in school, their accounts
  of life beyond sounded like a movie. When I told them about my life, they couldn''t
  help but notice the differences that existed between us. We were the same age, but
  due to the circumstances, my life story sounded like an ancient tale to them. Since
  then I have wondered, How is life beyond South Africa, across the seas? I have heard
  the stories of Africa that were told through travellers. I want to tell the story
  of the Great Britain through the eyes of an African.'
