Text: People are usually self- absorbed in their own world with people around them.
  They are excluded from different parts of the world that they could be more acceptable
  and welcomed. People in your community can be judgmental and have stereotypical
  towards those actions that are out of their prerformabces; in contrary,  you are
  more acceptable out there in different world for so many reasons. You look different
  / speak differently/ act differently / you speak for differences. Well... you are
  more accepted out there for the same reasons that you are excluded from your community.
  So now, what could ever ever be the reasons you should be on a trip that does not
  share the same type of norm from your own community?! Discover your thoughts & discover
  and see your actions or attitudes. Feel the needs to be courageous or needs of changes.
  Gain confidences & trust your guts. Take control of your thought and fears, but
  let your attitudes & laughters & actions free
