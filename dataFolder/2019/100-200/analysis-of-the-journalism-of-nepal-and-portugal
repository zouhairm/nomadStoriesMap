Text: 'I have been working in Nepal''s journalism sector for the past 15 years. Journalism
  is very challenging as Nepal is a desperate nation. Nepal''s journalism was very
  troubled during the conflict between the past 12 years ago. With the formation of
  new constitution in Nepal, the change in the country after the general elections
  has led the country to a new pace. The change in modern society, the development
  of new technology, is also looking for new content in common media in Nepal.

  When I am journalism in Nepal, what has been happening abroad? What are the themes
  of the media there? What are the problems of common society? I have searched for
  this opportunity for searching and writing about what topics are related between
  Nepal and Portugal. Hopefully your cooperation will match.'
