Text: 'Kyrgyz food is the product of a long history of pastoral nomadism and is overwhelmingly
  meat-based.And if we are saying overwhelmingly,it means really overwhelmingly.Those
  with vegetarian fixations may wish to fresh fruits,vegetables,and fresh bread from
  one of the ubiquitous in every city,eat in Chinese restaurants or stay with bread
  and tea only.While people from the West are programmed to think of large vegetables
  as desirable,small and flavourful is the rule here.Same is valid for pistachios,almonds
  as well.Washing vegetables before consumption is recommended.

  Besh barmak ("five fingers") is the national soupy dish of Kyrgyzstan.For  preparation,a
  sheep or horse is slaughtered and boiled in a large pot.

  The resulting broth is served as a first course.

  The meat is then divided up between those at the table.Each person in attendance
  receives the piece of meat appropriate to their social status.The head and eyes
  are reserved for guests of honor.The remaining meat is mixed in with the hands,although
  nowadays more often with a fork or spoon.Kyrgyz people like soupy food in general,those
  food that are served as kind of pasta in Russia (pelmeni),they prefer it as soup.'
