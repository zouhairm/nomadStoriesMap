Text: I am world traveller originally from Korea South. Since I started so travel
  after school, first job and trying to get a dream job as a cabin crew. The reason
  of traveling was I knew I had lack of overseas experience than other applicants.
  I probably had almost 30 interviews to be a cabin crew after I resigned my first
  'good enough' job. I booked a flight ticket got a working holiday visa granted and
  flew to Unknown world. I was lucky to met all good people in Sydney where I lived
  for the first time in different country and Melbourne as a 2nd city. I was shy non
  English speaks middle 20' Asian girl came AU to get a dream job. I worked hard to
  try my make up less fluency. After this experience motivated me to travel to EU
  - lived in Ireland and travel so many countries with unforgettable memories and
  NZ working for biggest motorhome company to support customers and Korean speaker.
  If I did not need to go through so many failure from airline company I wouldn't
  be here today as where I am.
