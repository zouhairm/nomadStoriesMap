Text: "I'm a Latin girl form El Salvador in central Am\xE9rica I came to portugal\
  \ to live by my own with 20 years old not not speaking portuguese and with the hope\
  \ to have the adventure of a life time since then I decided to explore Europe and\
  \ portugal mostly because I deeply fall in love with the country , the food , the\
  \ people and most of all the culture it's so amazing. Here in Portugal I learn that\
  \ to find I need to get lost, when I get lost I discovered the most amazing things\
  \ , this country grow in me and a Explorer spirit and learn from traveling a lot\
  \ of the amazing things portugal has to offer and about myself.\n\nI think this\
  \ opportunity its amazing because there's not much Latin people here in Portugal\
  \ and it's a door to another young people in Latin America who wants to travel and\
  \ portugal"
