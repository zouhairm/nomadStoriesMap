Text: 'When I was a kid my grandfather used to tell me stories about his experience
  in Europe during World War II, I just love to hear all about it. So, when I turned
  18 years old I decided to do this trip on my own by visiting the places he always
  tells me about it. Starting with London, France and last Rome. I was very excited
  to see all the pubs, cafes and buildings I heard in my stories, met amazing people
  and made new friends, I also took some photos for my grandfather to see the places
  he had loved so many years before moving to Brazil when the war ended. I still have
  a diary to write my adventures with letters, photos and everything that reminds
  me how wonderful this experience was for my life. I''m pretty sure no one can stop
  me now because, as Freddie Mercury once said,


  Don''t stop me now, I''m having such a good time

  I''m having a ball

  Don''t stop me now

  If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call


  So, if you want someone who loves being on the road and going crazy anytime, just
  pick me and give me a call.'
