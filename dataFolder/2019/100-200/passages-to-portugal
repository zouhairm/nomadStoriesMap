Text: During my passage to Portugal, I did not expect to write so many passages. The
  people and locales I experienced there were more than I could have imagined, as
  I have never traveled to Europe. The people, the places, the food and the beauty,
  hidden In each and every city and town where almost more than one could stand. The
  feeling of being overcome, with the abundance of visual beauty, were lessened somewhat,
  only by the aromas of the streets, in cities and towns alike. In the end, I had
  come to love the people, places and culture, that I may never have had the experience
  to experience, had I not set out, on this passage of passages.
