Text: "When two 40s Indian ladies decide to be adventurous and explore the red light\
  \ area..it was a fun riot.\nOur phone batteries were dead so no google map..when\
  \ asked the local where is the place..the answer was just the next lane ..which\
  \ we never found..our legs were hurting with the long walks and my co traveller\
  \ would just turn her face if i was asking a stranger for the way.\nLast but not\
  \ least when a man gave a spat on my ass..we just ran off that place.\nBut we did\
  \ not give up..next day we were back from Eindhoven well equiped and well read...and\
  \ yes we explored that place\n\U0001F923\U0001F60A From a true Indian lady"
