Text: Traveling can be a source of your mind massage and i like to do it usually.
  It is my passion to explore out the hidden beauty around us. The best beauty that
  i found in my life was there in Abbottabad (KPK) Pakistan. There were amazing sceneries
  to watch. It was a bit difficult track to reach up the Ayubia National Park, but
  it was a worthy to travel out there. Nature was laid there with open handedly, huge
  mountains with full of greenery don't let me forget those memories.  This place
  was totally unknown to me, but now it becomes the favorite one.
