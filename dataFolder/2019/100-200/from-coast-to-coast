  From coast to coast



  The idea of the story

  Buy or rent a van and organize a journey by car from the American Atlantic coast
  to the Pacific coast for a 3 months


  interview the local people and visited many villages and small towns along the way

  And the most important American monuments.


  And writing various reports on the trip

  In addition to photos and videos


  And then compiling content to write a book or maybe a documentary film.


  I am Mohamed Maher, an Egyptian journalist living in the United States of America.


  I work as a correspondent for Al Masry Al Youm Newspaper in Cairo and Al Ain News
  in the UAE.


  Always prefer to write about travel and trips

  I have visited 15 countries and lived between Egypt and the United States.'
