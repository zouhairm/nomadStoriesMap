Text: Kashmir is not a terrorist capital state of India but a paradise in the world,
  I went solo to Kashmir on my birthday to witness paradise without giving a thought
  of situation or circumstances there might be, my journey started from Bhopal Madhya
  Pradesh when I boarded my train Jhelum express and honestly the cruel side of humanity
  I experienced there I can't give it words finally my destination Jammu arrives and
  Inhale fresh air in my lungs with peasant aura of some bakery nearby hitchhiked
  till Srinagar explored every corner of Dal lake and old city shikara ride is something
  one should never miss while going to Srinagar from there I was supposed to go somewhere
  else but situation made my plan change and I went to Phelgham witnessed marriages
  scenic beauty and everything a heaven can offer. My Kashmir trip lasted for 15days
  and in these 15 days, I was never far from my family as locals never made me felt
  like a stranger I was a daughter to them indeed no state can compete with Kashmir
  in terms of hospitality. Scenic beauty is all over the world but hospitality is
  something that makes Kashmir paradise.
