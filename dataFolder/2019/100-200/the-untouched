Text: "Holy country,India with a diverse texture got to show us a lot. I happen to\
  \ visit few places within the country and realised how beautiful every touch it\
  \ contains. Maharashtra, gujrat, Manali, Uttarakhand, Kerala, madhya Pradesh, Uttar\
  \ Pradesh and karnataka, these states gave me certain values and soothing feel from\
  \ every little story within itself. I stayed with the people and could try the authentic\
  \ taste of it's identify while go around admiring beautiful architecture. The sun\
  \ could helped every inch shine within these countries but the stars and moon gave\
  \ it a heavenly touch of it's own. These countries had their own different tradition\
  \ and attires which was an icing to the creamy people. Every country is blessed\
  \ with Such rich hearted people which will surely make one feel warm. Memories of\
  \ the visits will always remain in my blessings. \nTravel to the fullest, but soaking\
  \ the richness of country in oneself is a true Traveller. A look isn't enough unless\
  \ try and dig out the mystery."
