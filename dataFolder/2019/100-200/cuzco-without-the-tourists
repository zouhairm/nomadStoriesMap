Text: 'While volunteering in Urubamba, a small town in the Peruvian Sacred Valley,
  I wanted to pay back my host family by cooking a meal. There was nowhere in the
  town where I could buy sauces, so I asked where to go and my host family gave me
  directions to the shopping area of Cuzco. They said this was the area where local
  families do their weekly shopping. Imagine my shock to enter the T-cross streets
  and avenues and discover no tourists whatsoever! I spoke to the locals: indulged
  in cakes served in plastic cups, spontaneously bought some nice quality socks, was
  very shocked when a man, delighted to know I was English, referenced football hooliganism!
  It was nice, heading back to my host family on the local crowded commuter bus while
  experiencing a normal locals'' weekend.'
