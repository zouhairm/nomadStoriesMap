Text: 'I always find peace and serenity looking at the sea and exploring the countryside
  where my family has got its origins, in the Mediterranean Sea. But my heart is always
  captured by the charm of the mystery: I like read fantasy stories and drawing the
  character. I never expected to find my dark side in the Czech Republic, especially
  in Prague: every street or corner remind me a story, tell me that there is something
  more behind. It''s like the building''s bricks keep the secrets of this town that
  has got origins in a very far past. When you walk through Karluv bridge, it''s like
  you know you are going through the gates of mystery: from the castle to the old
  astronomic clock, you breathe the history of these places. And once you''re home,
  you just know that one day you will come back, because this city catched you for
  the rest of your life.'
