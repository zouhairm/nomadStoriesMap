Text: "Gunfire echoes through a street strewn with bloodied corpses, shattered by\
  \ explosives, crushed by tanks. Children struggle on severed limbs, blood spouting,\
  \ futures stolen.\n\nThe terror ended. Class was dismissed. \n\nAn exchange student\
  \ in Chile, I was studying the country's culture of killing their own. I read of\
  \ Chile's volatile past, but sterile books do not trigger anguish like live imagery.\n\
  \nEmotion was inoculated with knowledge; violence is an ingrained trait of humankind,\
  \ currently pervading Brazil and Venezuela. Embedded in Chile\u2019s DNA, it could\
  \ soon return in the form of a new Pinochet.\n\nThus, I went to the Valpara\xED\
  so carnival armed with the conviction, \"live life\". \n\nConfetti detonated, launched\
  \ from storming chariots. Crowds barricading the streets cheered \"M\xE1s! M\xE1\
  s!\" (More! More!) as we danced in arms, defeating the thunder of marching drums.\n\
  \nBlunt force awakened survival instincts.\n\nShot with adrenaline, I charged the\
  \ raucous masses. Pinochet\u2019s sins ricocheted through my mind\u2019s retina.\
  \ Freedom became fear. \n\nMy purse was gone, dress ripped. I was wounded. \n\n\
  Mugged. \n\nLike millions before me, I was running for life.\n\nNext stop: Venezuela."
