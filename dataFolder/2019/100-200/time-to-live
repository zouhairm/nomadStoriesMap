Text: The location is Guadalajara Mexico. My girlfriend and I have just confessed
  our love for one another on a rooftop pizza stop during sunset. Our hearts are filled
  and our stomachs are full. As we walking down the steps to begin our journey across
  town to shop as the tiendas we notice a faint music playing in the distance. We
  feel the beat in our chest and begin to trek and hunt down the source of this festive
  sound. To our amaze we discover a festive within the city and endings in the culture
  the city is offering to us. We begin to travel from booth to booth and notice family
  we were amazed to find in the city. As we kindled on our time to get her we notice
  more members arriving and so we journey to the heart of the festivel, where the
  music is at its peak. I look the my beloved and twist my hips and we begin to dance.
  Once in that moment time slows and a smile emerges from her body and a moment that
  can only be explained as the warmth of the sun on my skin as the morning begins.
