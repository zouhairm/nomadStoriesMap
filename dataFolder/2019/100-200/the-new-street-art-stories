Text: The secret stories. what only locals know. What should be show only for a special
  one - is the modern street art. What is the pulse of real city life. Non from touristic
  guides. Real sincere alive. My idea is to find street- and urban artists and see
  the city by their own eyes, know local context and made a new guide. The Art is
  only language that does not need translation. And the most powerful tool of society
  development. I believe that stories of the modern street artists - the better way
  to understand and become in love with a city
