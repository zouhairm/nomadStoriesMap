Text: "India is a country with variety of cultures, religion, caste,  creed and language.\
  \  You will find different language in every 100 K.M. Despite being so much of difference,\
  \  India is a integrative country. \nI pertain  from a small village in Rajasthan\
  \ and for higher studies, I came out of my village,  I went travel to different\
  \ places in India which includes Jaipur- The pink city of India,  Udaipur, Kota,\
  \  Delhi, Ghaziabad, Meerat, Alwar,  etc. \nFirst time, when I came out, I was surprised\
  \ and scared by see that how small I am and my village is.  The cities  are growing\
  \ so fast,  Everyone was different here.  \nBut when I travel to the fort of the\
  \ Jaipur,  I found a kind of peace in myself.  I watched out that a city with so\
  \ much growing speed also have its ancient embroidery, a deep history and the living\
  \ standard of the old times etc. \nSimilarly,Udaipur is also like Jaipur which is\
  \ known for its royalty.  \nI am very much of attached to the nature and feel a\
  \ great sense of peace being around the nature."
