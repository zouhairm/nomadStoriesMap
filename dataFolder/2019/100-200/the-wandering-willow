Text: "Have you ever been to SE Asia? Neither had I. Until you are present and can\
  \ fully submerge yourself into a culture, it\u2019s really hard to know what it\
  \ feels like. The salty taste of the majestic waters, the humming of a different\
  \ language, and the vivid colors and spices entangled in food are only the beginning\
  \ of the experience. The adventure goes much deeper that. The locals spirits shine\
  \ with a different happiness, and they are friendly and kind. Coron Palawan, located\
  \ in the Philippines is a treasure of its own. Not only are their islands beautiful,\
  \ but so are their stories. In my time here, I have found a love for less, but feel\
  \ rich in my soul. The Philippines authenticicity is worth exploring on your next\
  \ trip to SE Asia."
