Text: "Myself.\nI didn\u2019t expect to find myself In the streets of a bustling old\
  \ world town in the mafia ruled town of Naples. But that\u2019s exactly what I found\
  \ on my solo, unplanned and unexpected visit to this mecca town on the west coast\
  \ of Italy.\n A town where underworld shadows operate beyond the seeing eye, old\
  \ traditions trump new modern millennials and the intoxicating aroma of homemade\
  \ artisan fare drifts through the streets. \nI strangely felt at home. I felt that\
  \ this was my place. Locals greeted me with a mix of familiarity and curiosity-\
  \ who is this single, young, white woman that visits us.... \nI also found my love\
  \ for coffee amongst the small local cafes here. \u2018Coffee hopping\u2019 became\
  \ my morning addiction; nothing compares to a smooth, hot, sweetly acidic shot of\
  \ manicured espresso on a chilly autum morning whilst winding round lost streets\
  \ in Naples. Bellisimo!\nI was searching for a distraction in my mess of a life,\
  \ but I found myself and my passion.\nYou taught me how to love life.\nI shall return.\n\
  Ciao Napoli"
