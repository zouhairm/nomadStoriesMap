Text: I'm from.the province of Lanao Del Sur. After I graduate my 1st degree l, I
  really want to travel somewhere in the world where can I find new people, new environmet,
  new friends as well but lacking of finance can stop your dreams. What i did is i
  went to Manila a capital city of our country which is Philipiines. I try to find
  work after a long journey and finally I have it but not enough to myself but at
  least I save a little amount of money then spend it on my papers going abroad in
  middle east. I know that someday, somehow I'll get there maybe in the right time
  even thought I really want to spend my time there but I have to wait for a long
  time to earn much money just to get there. Maybe not this time but some other time.
