Text: 'I like running. And when I run in a new place - this is very great for my inspiration.
  When you are running through a new city, in an unfamiliar country, and you can easily
  mark a place for yourself, where after the race you definitely need to look and
  look at everything in detail. There is a plus in this quick acquaintance with a
  new place: you do not spend a lot of time to go around everything and make hundreds
  of identical photos. You rush through the streets, greet the same, only local runners
  and feel at least half an hour local. Wake up, go for a run, recharge your batteries
  for a day, and then you can walk slowly around the city. Traveling at speed - allows
  you to see much more than a regular tour.'
