Text: "As a history student, everytime I travel I see the world with different eyes\
  \ as other tourists. When I went to Vienna, Austria, as I was walking through the\
  \ city, I could see the entireness of Vienna, Austria and Europe's history, from\
  \ the Habsburgs to the republic, going through the sieges of Vienna and the austro-hungarian\
  \ empire.\n\nI went day 24 of July of 2018, It was my 19th birthday, indeed an unforgetable\
  \ day and a night that I met such wonderful people, and even famous people! I went\
  \ to a RAF Camora concert, a famous artist from the capital, Who I always listened\
  \ to.\n\nI liked to say that Vienna has been my favourite place where I've been,\
  \ after traveling to Budapest, Par\xEDs, London, Liverpool, Barcelona, Madrid and\
  \ Chicago: It's a place where each and every times of history colide and create\
  \ a mix of a timeless city that stands equal throughout the years. \n\nI would love\
  \ to keep exploring the world and watching places through it's ways of nowadays\
  \ and what has It been, and even, what could It be the day of tomorrow."
