Text: 'I never did expect to find myself in the way that I did.


  Everyone talks about how they found themselves when they are a teenager, however,
  I found myself when I was a little girl. I was born into a military family. I was
  moving every three years until I was a senior in high school. But when I lived in
  Germany, I found myself. I found myself loving the culture and the sights around
  me. Living overseas at such a young age truly taught me to respect the culture and
  the people around me. Now that I am 20 years old, I wish to travel back overseas
  now that I am back in the United States. I want to experience the culture now that
  I am older and embrace everything around me.'
