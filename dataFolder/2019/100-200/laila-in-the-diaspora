Text: "This story talks about a Syrian refugee who moved to the United States after\
  \ the war and kept looking for a purpose in her life l, but should be reminded everyday\
  \ of how unplaced and  far away from home. After lots of loses of friends and lots\
  \ more of disappointment, she refuses to lose hope, all she wants is to find happiness\
  \ which she never fond i the US. One she thought to her self, that now that she\
  \ is a free bird who doesn\u2019t belong to anywhere, why not go look for love that\
  \ she is hungry for somewhere else. She is a fern believer that love does exist,\
  \ it might have several meanings, shapes, or forms but it does exists.\nThe journey\
  \ starts the second she hops on the plain."
