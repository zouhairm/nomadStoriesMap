Text: "My travel story belongs and is dedicated to my grandma, as well as all the\
  \ people who have to flee, migrate and/or seek refuge in another country. Grandma\
  \ takes me to Baghdad to show me where she grew up, but realises she doesn't want\
  \ to leave again, for the second time. The story follows her lead - physically in\
  \ the city and emotionally, as she selectively go through her past, current life\
  \ in Israel and how she sees the future. The end is her end this time, not imposed\
  \ on her but a choice, reconnection, defining her home. It is a story of farewells\
  \ and unknown future, settlement and longing, and also exploration. \n\nI would\
  \ rather not paste the story into this box as I feel it is unfair to show 70% finished\
  \ story, let alone since I apply for the Rewriting and editing interest.\nI hope\
  \ the theme and the plot spine are enough to judge my application by."
