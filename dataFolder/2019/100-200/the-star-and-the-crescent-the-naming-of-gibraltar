Text: No one has heard the full account of how culture was spread throughout Europe
  and the rest of the Western world, until now! This story is a historical perspective
  of the 711 conquering of Spain by the Moors and their general, General Tarik ibn
  Ziyaad.  It is filled with stories, historical speeches as well as some magical
  realism from tales and legends that arose from the time between 711 AD and how it
  has impacted all of our lives.  The tale is a story of a slave who became a powerful
  general and how what he, did changed the world as we know it.  I myself am a Christian,
  the general was a student of Islam yet I feel this story needs to be seriously written
  in English.  I am disabled in a wheelchair yet that does not stop my from travelling
  and especially from writing.
