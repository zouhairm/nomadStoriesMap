Text: First time travelling alone finding hidden treasures and myself. The colours,
  the aesthic and the simplicity of life in Bali convinced me to persuade my dream
  and start writing about travelling. Is a way if reflecting what I have seen and
  lived through my eyes and at the same time encourage people to travel alone as far
  as they can. It gets you out of your comfort zone and you appreciate things you
  already had it for granted. The colours, the taste and the energy of this place
  is incredible. Reminds you an innocent period of your childhood when everyrhing
  was so easy and pure
