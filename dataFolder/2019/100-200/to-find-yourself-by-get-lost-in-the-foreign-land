Text: "We are living in the repeating habits , we woke up and go to work after that\
  \ we finish work we go home and tomorrow same things repeat again .. \nIt is easy\
  \ to lose your self in the routines, and one day we wake up and we realized that\
  \ we need to find something .. \nTravel to foreign land , is a way to find our self\
  \ . To get lost in the foreign land , its like our body getting excited over new\
  \ experience again - like child that learning new experience.. How our body feel\
  \ free and excited .. New breath of fresh air into our soul ..\nGetting lost in\
  \ order to find back yourself ..\nLets wandered in the unknown land .. and learn\
  \ its beauty .."
