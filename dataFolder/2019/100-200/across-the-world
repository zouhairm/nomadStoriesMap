Text: So this is my story and in fact I have never traveled the world or left my state,
  but I will tell a little of it and what this experience can add to who I am. I am
  a 21 year old girl, I live in Brazil and I have never traveled, I love writing and
  photographing dream in one day this will be my total lifestyle. I always had a great
  dream and one of them is one day to meet at least one country that is not only mine,
  and write about it by showing others that your dreams can be fulfilled when you
  seek it. That's my story there is not much to add, I do not have a travel story
  to tell, and if I can get that bag, I'll definitely go. write it.
