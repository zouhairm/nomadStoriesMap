Text: "Pretty much always stories are happenings of the past or at least a past few\
  \ days! For now, I am just writing what happened to me just a few hours back. Well,\
  \ it was just a pretty good morning today and I was just sitting at my hostel. For\
  \ me, I never take hostels while travel, but this time I intentionally did. So I\
  \ sat at the table around the corner of the hostel garden, all furnished and beautiful.\
  \ The breeze was blowing its way and it kissed her hairs. She gave a good smile\
  \ to the wind which captured my attention. Pretty much the way it had to happen\
  \ we conversed a lot on cultures and went on the bamboo train trip at Battambang!\
  \ \u201CCarmon\u201D, as she is called, she is way too much of a kind soul and an\
  \ amazing woman! Now I got the reason, why I feel home sick for places which aren\u2019\
  t my home while I travel... Oh yes, it\u2019s the friends and the people I make..\
  \ Anyways it was just one fine afternoon and everything still remains the same but\
  \ for me it was an unexpected friendship, something which worth a gem Stone!"
