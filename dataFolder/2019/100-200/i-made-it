Text: "I woke up rushing around trying to find my ticket , I had 1 hour to pack and\
  \ leave.  As I reached the airport , I headed for the gate to leave . It was finally\
  \ happening , what I've longed for so much . To see this beautiful world God created\
  \ . \n\nI awoke to passengers passing by me to get off the plane as I sat there\
  \ in excitement to finally start my journey.  I made it ...... I made it \nI jumped\
  \ off the last step like kid in a candy store . Oh the sun beamed down one , filled\
  \ with bliss , joy  , laughter \nAnd this is where my journey begins ."
