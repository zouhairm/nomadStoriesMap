Text: My name is Favio Lopez. I was born in La Paz Bolivia, in a desert farm in the
  middle of hills. My story is about the stages and the moments. why? I currently
  live in Argentina, I finished the University, behind were the rubber tires of truck
  wheels, the dust and the snot hanging. But I do not forget it. I remember it as
  something good, that helps me think and create. My story continues and if I make
  the trip the distance between the beginning (my birth) and the current Favio would
  be filled with intangibles and stages that I am excited to think about where they
  will take me. In which word synthesis will terminate.
