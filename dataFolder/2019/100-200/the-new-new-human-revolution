Text: In first month of 2019 I went to goa. The main aim of this trip was to only
  entertainment. But it turn out of something that made deep impression in my heart.  I
  went their with my friend and due to craze of alcohol drinks. My friend was fully
  drunk and sub consciously he was sharing his story where he told that he haven't
  meet his son since last 5 years. The deep wound was reflecting in environment itself.
  On beach there were little kid was begging for food. Can't believe this situation
  occur at  same time. On one side he his struggling to meet his child and on other
  side kid don't know where his father. Surely I would have mission so I witnessed
  this situation. My mentor says that Human revolution within single individual can
  change the world.
