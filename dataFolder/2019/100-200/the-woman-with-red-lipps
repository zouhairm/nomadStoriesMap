Text: 'Every time I wear my red lipstick it means only one thing: I am ready for a
  new journey, a new adventure, a new challenge to face .. I wear my red lipstick,
  because it is my fuel of life, because for me and the color of life, of passion
  and love that I put into everything I do .. and so with my red lipstick, and a small
  backpack (strictly red), I set off to discover this land, Denmark, mostly known
  for its capital, Copenhagen, but very little for its wild beaches, its small wooden
  houses, precisely RED, which run along the coasts of the island of Fyn, or those
  small cafeterias, where already from the entrance, I was perverse by that smell
  intense of cinnamon, that in an instant, gave me that sweet and involuntary smile,
  that sprouted on my face, by magic ... the magic of Denmark, I was only started
