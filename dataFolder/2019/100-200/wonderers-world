  \ I makr it all happen? Will I go alone ? Can I handle it all? \nAll these questions\
  \ played in my mind over and over again as The excitement rised in my whole body.\
  \  Not knowing whats ahead of me scared me in a way that I have never been scared\
  \ before.  but for the first time I was excited to be scared.  I placed my hand\
  \ on my shiny glob and turned it, closed my eyes and placed the tip of my finger\
  \ on the place i was destined to go.  JAPAN that was gonna be where i start..."
