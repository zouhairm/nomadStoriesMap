Text: "It\u2019s an exploration into letting go and separating ones self from the\
  \ daily patterns we all accept as \u201Cthe way we\u2019re meant to live\u201D.\
  \ The idea that everyone should simply be born, go to school, work, have a family\
  \ and then retire, when the universe we live in is endless and infinite is saddening\
  \ to me. Everyday we just accept that pattern and resign our lives over to society\
  \ because that\u2019s the path of least resistance. We\u2019re so afraid of appearing\
  \ different that we literally BOX ourselves into categories created by society to\
  \ better decide for us how to live our lives. Un-boxing Yourself is an almost biographical\
  \ diary account that follows me as I have spent the last 3 years trying to break\
  \ those pattterns, nock down those walls and Un-box myself from the convenient packaging\
  \ that society has marketed me as."
