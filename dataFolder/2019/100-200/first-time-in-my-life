  \ and decided I will go.....\n\nI never go to Canada and it far from my country,Thailand.\
  \ I find to search for host it cheaper than hotel , book tickets and go...\n\nOnly\
  \ one in the big town,Vancouver. I walk,ask,walk,see map and walk every day. I go\
  \ to important places, I learn to travel by train by bus and learn to walk faster.\n\
  \nI\u2019m appreciate when I go to Vitoria island. It the famous place that who\
  \ come to Vancouver must visit the island still look like England. I went to the\
  \ parliament and deep to the first era who established this place.\n\nSo,Capilano\
  \ Suspensions Bridges is the place you should go. When you walk to the forest walk\
  \ on the bridge maybe you will excited,but I feel warm and calm.\n\nSo many places,\
  \ many people that I met for 3 weeks that I live there,and it first time that I\
  \ travel by myself."
