Text: "The love of love, it\u2019s an epic idea and we always explore using the word\
  \ but what do we know about it. What drives our love for art?, culture, food. This\
  \ idea and expression from where does it originate. Yes Paris is the city of love\
  \ but Italy is the city from which love was born. From the food to the art, I just\
  \ want to share with you, my audience these different forms of love that I\u2019\
  m going to explore and hopefully in the end , Me an adopted child from the south\
  \ side of Chicago who has never been out of the country can share this experience\
  \ with you. Not only from the love in my heart but to motivate you to go explore\
  \ and find love on your journey."
