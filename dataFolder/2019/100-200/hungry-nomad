Text: "So to say I was traveling since I was under 5years of age because my father\
  \ is in army and where ever he is posted we go along with him and that's how I jab\
  \ traveled all the directions of india, tasted everything, know multi languages\
  \ which is really a advantage for me as a traveler as I can connect with people\
  \ real quick. I went to Nagaland once and I realised that the food was toooooo good\
  \ without using masala or any oil. I had 4 plates of rice with lots of meat and\
  \ boiled veggies and I realised that the host were so happy to see me lobing the\
  \ food. That's how I realised I not just love traveling but I connect with people\
  \ by sharing local cuisine and trying to learn their language. I might not speak\
  \ perfectly but theirs a joy connecting with people.\nNow I explore places, look\
  \ for local cuisine and try their languages. \n\u270C\uFE0F@HungryNomad."
