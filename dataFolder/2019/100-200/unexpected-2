Text: "hello everybody,\n\nthe nature of my degree course has prepared me to join\
  \ an international company . It involved a great deal of independent research, requiring\
  \ initiative, self-motivation and a wide range of skills.\n\nI used to be a translator\
  \ for a German company and I undertake a variety of tasks, including providing customer\
  \ service.\n I AM ITALIAN I SPEAK ENGLISH AND GERMAN.\n\nStudying for a degree and\
  \ working have made it necessary for me to learn very quickly how to prioritise\
  \ tasks, and have instilled in me the need to remain flexible. I have had to be\
  \ highly organised in order to meet tight deadlines both at work and study.\n\n\
  ALL I NEED TO DO NOW IN LIFE IS EXPLORING THE WORLD AND THIS IS A REAL CHANCE FOR\
  \ ME I AM WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR!\nNOTHING CAN'T STOP ME !"
