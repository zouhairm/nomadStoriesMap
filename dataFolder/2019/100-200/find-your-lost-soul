Text: "I came into a desperate place where resources are not well-off, tried pushing\
  \ myself into a goal of reaching my dream destination since I was a kid - New Zealand.\
  \ \n\nI came across countries, from Philippines to United Arab Emirates to New Zealand\
  \ for an overseas works - slash- to travel & explore the country. Never thought\
  \ that God would answer my practically long lost prayer to find my lost soul. \n\
  \nI had this wee son, he is Isaiah, I stepped into an inspiration of leaving him\
  \ home to give all the necessities he needs - practically saying, if he grows up\
  \ I want him to see me and say to me, \"Momaah, I'm proud of you.\" It's hard yet\
  \ it's an amazing thing to do, between leaving home and going into your ventured\
  \ goal is fulfilling. \n\nTravelling, for me, is finding out my lost soul. Taking\
  \ a huge steps away from home & giving myself the full authority to decide and gather\
  \ my broken pieces from the world that I want to jive in."
