Text: "Women alone.  Are you discriminated against because you are not a couple? \
  \ Do you pay more for your accommodation because of that?  We travel to Portugal\
  \ to find out.  Lisbon.  Are you safe in the city of history?  The city of  Ferdinand\
  \ Megellan? Of Batholmeuu Dias?  Or, dare we say it?  Christiano Ronaldo?  Where\
  \ does one go for the so-called famous Bacalhau \xE0 br\xE1s?  What does that mean?\
  \  And where can I get it? Or maybe we can discover Sardinhas at the ubiquitous\
  \ road-side stalls? There may be more to the locally-called Lisboa than we had ever\
  \ imagined.  And it may, perhaps, be cheaper than a sojourn in Spain?  But with\
  \ the same history, architecture, aesthetic, and culture.  Find out."
