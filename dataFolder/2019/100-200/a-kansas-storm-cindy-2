Text: "A Kansas Storm\n\nI didn't care that I was barefoot in a dirty motel parking\
  \ lot. \nI was raw and drenched and I was exhausted in every way a person could\
  \ be.\nI just stood there, looking up at the lightning in the Kansas Sky and the\
  \ flickering glow of the motel sign.\n\nI am in a moment, I thought. \n\nIt's been\
  \ so long since I've had a moment, \n\nand I'm not ready for it to pass.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\
  \nCindy\n\nIn New Orleans I went to a concert where I was surrounded by sweaty friendly\
  \ strangers. The air was hot and sticky, but I didn't mind. I felt like royalty\
  \ in my strappy black bra and denim shorts. \n\nIt was the week of a tropical storm\
  \ and I kept dancing as she arrived and made her downpour debut. I kept dancing\
  \ until the song had ended and the band scurried every which way to salvage their\
  \ speakers and amps from the rain."
