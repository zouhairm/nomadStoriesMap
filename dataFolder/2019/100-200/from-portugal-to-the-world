Text: 'I would like the people of my country, as well as the people of Portugal, to
  know about our traditions, customs and food. I think that living with locals makes
  you know more about the country, how local people live there, what is the normal
  food that is only in the place, how are the small supermarkets in the area, the
  most recommended areas to visit, the best season, etc.

  It would be very interesting to know what people in Portugal think about Mexicans
  in general, what their favourite Mexican dish is and how much they know about Mexico
  or what Mexican people think about Portuguese people.'
