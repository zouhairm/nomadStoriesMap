  \ like to do in they own ordianry life. When Travel Through the Balkans u see like\
  \ stone like something beautiful that Will be born soon. The most beautiful adri\xE1\
  tic coast. Culture Balakn People its going many century ago in the history. People\
  \ Share together history and other stuff. Hiden isalnds are very precios place to\
  \ get know better. Most of People are si calm and reading most of time and want\
  \ to be more educated then other. When talk to local the smart u Will always be\
  \ suprise by some answers because they are clever and from that moment u can see\
  \ biger picture of local enviorment, how everything works. What is are advantages\
  \ and disadvantages of local community."
