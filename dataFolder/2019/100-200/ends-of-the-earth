Text: So I was listening to a song and I heard thhe lyrics end of the earth, something
  prompt me to get on a plane and just go to Vatican. So I quit my 9 to 5 job and
  pursued this soft voice bugging me. Landing in the land of honey my heart felt peace
  looking over the sunset. I knew I was at the right place at the right time. Taking
  a gap year doing community service voluntarily. Some people thought it was crazy,
  but my world view, knowledge and ambitions changed once I began speaking to an older
  lady in the Vatican city center. Her life experiences and culture intrigued into
  exploring the beauty. It was nothing I have ever seen, structures and fields was
  out of a story book. I saw a floating Ballon for the first time. It was all because
  of my desire to seek discomfort and take a risk going to Vatican. I'll do it all
  over again.
