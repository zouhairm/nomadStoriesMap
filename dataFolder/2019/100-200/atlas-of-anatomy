Text: "4.  The \"Atlas of Anatomy\" is an medico-anthropological documentation on\
  \ the remnants of human bodies. The film will encompass a search for dead bodies\
  \ in places typically unvisited by medical practitioners, in pursuit of archiving\
  \ body parts and associating the remnants with physiological and environmental causes.\
  \ Later the digitizations will be made into highly detailed illustrations, locations,\
  \ dimensions, and colored dissections included, with archaeological photographs,\
  \ in the Human Anatomy Illustration Encyclopedia. It is through the lens of a \"\
  human journey\" film but will conclude in a written thesis project. Therefore, the\
  \ entire project is threefold: 1. a film. 2. photographs and documentation 3. highly\
  \ detailed anatomical Encyclopedia for use in the medical field. Results will be\
  \ researched alongside pathologists' and physicians' journals and writings. The\
  \ objective is to provide documentation to the orthopedic and general surgeons,\
  \ to learn potential causes of internal diseases affecting external musculoskeletal\
  \ structure, and to provide insight into the journey back in time to the \"undiagnosed.\"\
  \ \n\nIf not human bodies found, then skeletal remnants of other species will be\
  \ documented."
