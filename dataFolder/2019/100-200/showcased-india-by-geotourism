Text: 'Geotorism holds a great potential for preservation of significant geological
  structures and mountain of India. The diversity of landscapes of India consist of
  geological, tectonic and geomorphic features from Karakoram in the north to Kanyakumari
  in the south largest salt desert in Great Rann of Kuch in East to caves of Meghalaya
  in the west .


  The porblem today is not of the dearth of sites of geo- diversity but we all have
  to shake hands to develop them in India. India has to develop and showcase our landscapes
  and diversity our history and geological evolution and clean environment. It calls
  for collective action of earth scientist, local community, Tourism departments,
  agencies, freelancers and NGOs.


  Let move forward and hold the hand and make a innovative approach to develop India
  with Geotourism.'
