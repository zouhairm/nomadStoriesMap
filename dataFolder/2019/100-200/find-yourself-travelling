Text: Find the world inside you... Find the words that your heart is telling... See
  the colours.... Find the magical of nature... The little things that became the
  treasure... Your treasure... Safe yourself from the toxins of society and dance
  all day, all night... Be free... Smille and open your arms to the world... To the
  society...  Step by step you will find the way... The short way to say.... I'm alive...
  I'm in this world and i'll help to make the difference... Don't forget yourself
  and the goods things that we can make together... Travelling.... To find the way
  home.... To find you inside the cruelty sistem.... To find the best way to live....
  To find the real colours in the nature... Writing something like a real painting...
