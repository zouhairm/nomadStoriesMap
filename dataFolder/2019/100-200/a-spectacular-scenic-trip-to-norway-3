Text: 'A spectacular scenic trip to Norway

  Last year I went to Norway. Firstly Oslo, secondly  Bergen and finally Flam. And
  I loveit, of course, I don''t how would think of those places in the dark seasons.

  All of Norway is full of English speakers, remarkable nice people that would stop
  in the middle of the street and listen to a question in bad spoken English, always
  ready to assist. Oslo has picturesque little streets that for a moment make me think
  in Paris. Bergen with its colorful wooden houses, fish market, and panoramic view
  was beautiful, but a little bit crowded, any corner of tht town was full of the
  widest gamma of tourists. Flam was smaller than Bergen but Train of Flam is worth
  the stop and money, although I would recommend for people that get sich easy because
  the route was twisted and long.

  Overall Norway has its peculiar charm. Everyone is willing to talk or assist while
  taking his time to do their own thing. Everything works and all the transport is
  on time. If you want to relax, and get in touch with nature in a friendly environment,
  Norway is the place!'
