Text: "I want to learn and see how digitization is influencing travel in different\
  \ countries. I observed that in Africa a lot of people are stunned by how developed\
  \ we are becoming and it stunts me as many travelers have a certain expectation\
  \ of what they except Africa to look like. We are in the 4th industrial revolution\
  \ and I want to see if other countries are adapting and how they are adapting. As\
  \ a traveler it\u2019s important to notice this things about technology and how\
  \ it impacts a certain country. I want to win this trip so I can be able to write\
  \ a story or a book about the world of traveling and technology."
