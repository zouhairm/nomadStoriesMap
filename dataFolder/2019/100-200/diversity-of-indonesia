Text: "Indonesia..\nIs made up of 17,500 islands and 33 provinves, meaning that the\
  \ cultural landscape is also a diverse one. \nWe can feel more  the diversity in\
  \ Bali. The culture & socialand the religion are bare in mind to the diversity.\n\
  The Balinese are the last remaining, but still very strongly believing, Hindus in\
  \ Indonesia, with most the rest of the country being muslim and other than that\
  \ chritians, and buddists. This makes Bali a very different character to the rest\
  \ of country and its proud Hindu cultural traditions provide a great platform for\
  \ the temples, the dance, the art and the processions that make it such an attractive\
  \ place to visit.\nIn the meantime enjoy the beauty and culture of Bali and if you\
  \ have a chance, the amazing diversity of Indonesia."
