Text: Tired of the mess in my city, unployed ans free to go anywhere on earth, I decided
  to get back to the most charming tiny fisherman village in Northeast, Jericoacoara.
  Where the streets are made of sand, the nights are made of stars, stunning big orange
  sun always surprises us in a daily sunset show, where the water is warm and relaxing
  and time seamed to stop, cause it takes its own time with the wind...Wind that tranforms
  the clouds each second, colorful the sky with many kites, takes the sand and our
  hair to dance. Times flies, but in this charming little village, for some people
  takes time to understand that Jeri has her own way, own time, and once you are here,
  let yourself goes with the wind of Jeri, like a fairytale, once upon a kite, Jeri
  with all your singular way, unique nature, will lead you to a deep connection with  yourself
  and nature. Natives used to say, once you drink the water of Jeri, you will never
  be the same and you will always return.
