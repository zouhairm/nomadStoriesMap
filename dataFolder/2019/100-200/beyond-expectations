Text: "It was our first time to go out of our own country to another South East Asia\
  \ country. I and a friend of mine chose to spend our last days of 2018 in Vietnam\
  \ and New Year in Siem Reap. From what we know it was supposed to be 25 Celcius\
  \ degree in Vietnam, but guess what.... the weather surprised us. When we stepped\
  \ out from the airport, it was chilly, our jackets couldn\u2019t hold it. It was\
  \ 15.... and then going down to 9. The rest of the days were about 10 and 11 Celcius\
  \ degree. It was a really experience for us, that never has a cold weather experience.\
  \ The coldest in our hometown is only 22 to 25 Celcius degree. Raining made the\
  \ weather in Hanoi became freezing. We bought winter clothes and had our first winter\
  \ holiday. But that was the fun parts. See the charming of Hanoi city and the mesmerising\
  \ Halong Bay make everything perfect."
