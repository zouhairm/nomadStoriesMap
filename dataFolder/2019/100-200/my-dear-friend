Text: "My Dear Friend,\n\nYou\u2019re beautiful and everlasting. \nYou can be powerful\
  \ and restless, you can scream out loud  and you can whisper softly calming me down.\n\
  \nI still remember how we first met.\nI\u2019ve travelled thousands of miles, from\
  \ east to west, spending hours on the road.\n\nAnd here you\u2019re. \n\nThis was\
  \ a sunny Monday morning and people were passing by without paying any attention\
  \ to you. They used to see you every day. Not a big deal.\n\nYou know what? I was\
  \ so jealous to kids who grew up next to you. However now, they don\u2019t appreciate.\
  \ They don\u2019t understand how it feels to live in a small town of cold Siberia\
  \ and then find yourself next to you.\n\nThey\u2019ll never have this feeling when\
  \ the heart is beating so loud and it feels like there is something in your chest.\n\
  \nYour energy is charming and fearing at the same time.\nThis sound of the waves\
  \ ...  that\u2019s how you talk, right?\nYou\u2019re life and death. You\u2019re\
  \ indifferent stranger and the best teacher.\n\nSometime I sense like I want to\
  \ cry because I\u2019m so happy and lucky to see you every day.\nI\u2019m running\
  \ towards you as a little kid.\n\nMy Dear Friend.\n\nMy Dear Ocean."
