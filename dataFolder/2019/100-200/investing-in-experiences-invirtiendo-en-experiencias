Text: 'My trip through the Middle East, and in this case Iran, started as all my previous
  trips: alone with my backpack in search of authentic experiences, living like the
  local people and interacting with them. When traveling alone it is much easier to
  relate, learn and discover wonderful people and places.


  I also try to make my trips have a historical sense. A historical sense that in
  this part of the world is most impressive. From the search of wonders of the ancient
  world until the search of new flavors and sensations, where in a culture like the
  European one it is difficult to find.'
