Text: 'Motivation and fear, after all, what brings us closer to one and the distance
  from the other. Feelings feed or kill our days. What to do to follow the path of
  motivation and how we are drawn by worldly fear.

  This project presents how the digital world has contributed to the streets being
  filled with empty people and digital applications filled with empty people. Are
  we living in a bipolar world?

  How to reconnect the past with the future, preserving our story without feeding
  it with fake news?

  This journey takes us to the forgotten past behind the walls of the buildings of
  the centers of the great cities. Which leads people to debate for support of a celebrity''s
  opinion, and ignore the history being consumed by abandonment.'
