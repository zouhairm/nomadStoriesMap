Text: I started to explore the nature with bike to see the unseen by going to the
  unnamed roads as I want to see different views with different options of traveling.
  Explore street foods where I can eat cheap, tasty, and full of experience like locals.
  Went to different spots with plastic bag with me as I will bring any rubbish I can
  bring to the bin where some of them don't care about environment. So always telling
  people who comes for visit not to leave any rubbish on the ground. Traveling and
  educate people to look after the nature so we can enjoy the view without rubbish.
