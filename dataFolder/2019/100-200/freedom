Text: 'Words are expressed only after experience and whatever said without expereince
  is like heartless talks. However, feeling like, should adopt local transportaion
  so that you get a golden chance to speak to localites and understand the culture
  from real point of view. Staying in hotel wont serve my purpsoe, i prefer to stay
  at spiritual places or homestay to lean forward in the arms of beauty of the city
  and then to rise with the sunrise is altogether different jouful. Eatings local
  food is like heaven for me. Keeping low budget purposely helps to take the journey
  on another level of experience. Thank You !

  My last visit was between India and Bhutan. Train, Local bus was life time memorable
  experience.'
