Text: On a cruiseship with my mom, one the spots we stopped was Estonia. I knew almost
  nothing about the country, and I was much more insterested in the other destinations
  on the cruise (Russia and Sweden). I just spent one day there, but I didn't expect
  to find such kinship with a country; as I learned more about their culture, their
  beliefs, their economic system and such, I fell in love. We visited an historic
  castle at the city of Rakvere, old-time museums and little streets in the capital,
  Tallin, and everything I was discovering was new and yet, it felt like something
  I always knew in my heart. If you want to know a historic place that not many people
  talk about, I recommend Estonia. It's a small country compared to where I am from,
  but i has so much to offer. And you can find such a peaceful mindset, just walking
  down there and getting to know their people. It's amazing what only one day did
  to me; definitely a place where I will go back to.
