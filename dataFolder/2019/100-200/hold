Text: I miss him even in his presence. Long back I lost my dad to Alzheimer. The other
  day in the middle of the conversation with my friend's dad, he said things which
  I always wanted to hear from my dad, in essence to what he said was "if you face
  any problem in life just let me know for once and it will be taken care of. You
  are like my daughter". I did not expect anyone say that to me. I broke down. After
  long it felt like home. I am scared that maybe again I 'll lose my home. Maybe I
  'll pretend to be happy or maybe thay are here to stay.
