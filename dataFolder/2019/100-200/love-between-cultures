Text: I lived in Ireland for a year and I travelled around the Ireland all weekend
  in order to get deeply involved with the culture. However, a couple of weeks before
  I had to come back to Spain I found the love of my life. I felt terrible in love
  with someone that I have to left there. It was not enough time to know each other
  properly; however everything was super intense. I would like to find that love once
  again and be able to talk about it through a romance story. (I am a romantic person,
  but I do not know how to express those feelings in the paper if I'm not sad and
  I would like to learn that)
