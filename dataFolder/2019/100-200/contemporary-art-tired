Text: "The tour starts at customs with my bad English, I was barred by the officer.\
  \ But they did not tell me that I took maps I drew and painted so as not to lose\
  \ me. What became a phenomenon among the officers who gathered to see the drawings.\n\
  \ Released for entry, I visit all the galleries and museums of London, seeing from\
  \ Banksy to Van Gogh.\nBut what struck me the most on the trip, happened outside\
  \ the gallery. When in a rain I went to get shelter under a marquee.\nI do not know\
  \ if it was my wet clothes, my beard or Latin face. A pretty woman offered money,\
  \ which I refused. She insisted a lot, until both of them spoke loudly, I took the\
  \ money and she thanked me. Thanks!"
