Text: "This travel memoir recounts my journey from St Petersburg to Beijing, via Siberia\
  \ and Mongolia and is rooted in literature - books read along the journey which\
  \ helped me connect with the history and atmosphere of each place as I passed through.\
  \ Intertwined with this is the connections with local people and the incredible\
  \ and widely changing landscape that the train journey took us through. \nIn 2016,\
  \ my husband and I travelled on the train for our honeymoon. We flew to St Petersburg,\
  \ travelled by the red arrow train to Moscow, then on through Siberia to Irkutsk\
  \ and lake baikal. The train then turned south to Ulan Bator where we disembarked\
  \ and travelled through the gobi, travelling with local and sustainable guides and\
  \ spending 3 days on our own with nomads in their Gers. We then travelled back to\
  \ Ulan Bator to rejoin the train, arriving the next day in a very busy Beijing where\
  \ we ended our trip. \nWhen researching the trip, I found very little about the\
  \ Mongolian route of the transiberian beyond tour guides. I researched literature\
  \ available in translation by native authors, or set in the spaces through which\
  \ we would be travelling."
