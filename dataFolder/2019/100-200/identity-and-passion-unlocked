Text: 6 months around Europe with nothing but  a backpack, a camera and the person
  who I thought I knew to be myself. The niave, sheltered and ignorant girl I once
  was - gone. A strong, vibrant and confident woman is what I have become since my
  endeavours into the unknown. Someone who thrives to be better. To do better! Experiences
  are what challenge and allow us to discover our true identity and passion. We are
  not weak. We have the whole world in the palm of our hands. All we need to do is
  grab it. But would you grab the unknown? Would you take a leap of faith and trust
  in yourself that you will discover the things you imagined? Or will things not be
  as they seemed before? Will you be pleasantly surprised or disturbed by the outcome?
  Experience the world. Challenge yourself and engage with the people that make this
  world whole. Not all is good. Not all is bad. Leap into the unknown and you will
  truly live.
