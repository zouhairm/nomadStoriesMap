Text: I had dreamed about fly since I was a little girl in a time where there wasn't
  internet, Facebook, Instagram and etc. My dad used to listen to Beatles and taught
  me the songs and I started wonder who were those people singing in a different language
  and where did they live. So I grew up keeping on my mind that someday I will take
  a flight and land on that strange land. 34 years after I was there in my first flight
  crossing the ocean to land on Liverpool to sing in absolute happyness the Beatles
  songs in Cavern Club. Nobody believed that a poor girl from Itaquera could do it.
  But I made it! I am the world's greatest.
