Text: I have convinced myself, that Im going to die soon. Why is that?, I think because
  I want to find who I really am, in places far from home where maybe I could learn,
  discover, find inspiration, find my real me, learn from another culture, another
  feelings... I love music, I love to dance and I want to restore myself into a happy
  and greatful person. I want to discover that there is no end to my life, that there
  are a lot of things for me, I know that there are a lot of things in the world,
  but I want to believe it, I want to find happiness by finding myself, I want to
  know how to live withmyself, accept the human being that I am, and be happy.
