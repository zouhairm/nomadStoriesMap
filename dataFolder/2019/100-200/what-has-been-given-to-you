Text: "Seeing the prosperous farms out my window, I took note that there\u2019s more\
  \ to Pakistan than what I thought. If there\u2019s more to the country, there\u2019\
  s more to the people. Tapping on my one-week long Pakistani friend, I posed the\
  \ question, \u201CWhat is the one thing you want Americans to know about your people?\u201D\
  \ \n\nHis eyes fixed on the fields, he breathed in. \u201CI want you to know that\
  \ we are not all the same. We are not all terrorists. There\u2019s more to us.\u201D\
  \ \n\nAs I looked back at the farm it spoke of Pakistan\u2019s potential, along\
  \ with its unpredictability. As a farmer scatters seed, he witness\u2019 its potential,\
  \ but not fully knowing what the final outcome is. Some seed may fall in the rocky\
  \ area, some may be picked up by the birds and others fall in the fertile soil.\
  \ \n\nTherefore, how will you respond to what\u2019s given to you? \n\nThere\u2019\
  s more to places and people than you think, so you need to go explore, listen, and\
  \ learn for yourself."
