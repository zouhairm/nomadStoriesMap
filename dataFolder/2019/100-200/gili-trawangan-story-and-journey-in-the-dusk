Text: 'At first, I wanted to write the history and culture of Gili Trawangan, Lombok.
  However, when I interviewed locals in the island, they told me another more important
  story behind the luxurious of tourism: land conflict. The locals wanted me to lift
  up the story and bring it to the world, so that people know that the locals'' life
  is not as bright as it looks. Finally, the book, titled Gili Trawangan Cerita dan
  Perjalanan pada Senja, has been published and the revenue from the book sales has
  been distributed for earthquake victims in Lombok last year.


  I truly believe that travel story should not only about the fun that we get on the
  journey, but also spread the truth and put the joy to others'' life.'
