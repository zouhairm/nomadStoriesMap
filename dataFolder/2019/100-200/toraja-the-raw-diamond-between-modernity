Text: 'I went to Toraja in the end of 2017. A journey which been arrange for almost
  a year, all of the budgets, and the ittanary was made by my self. I decide to go
  whereever I want and for how many days.

  Batutumonga, nek gendheng museum, and Palawa are my priority. But suddenly my travelmate
  nag me to add Negeri diatas Awan into our schedule. And, it was a great decision
  I''ve ever make for my entire life.

  You can see the cloud which hang on the top of the forest under where you stand.
  It looks like an Ocean on the mountain. Slowly, the sun rises and the Ocean seems
  really real. With a white yet temptating, made me stand still for almost an hour.


  Someday, I''ll be back. Those are the promise I''ve made. And I will make sure that,
  I will pay it full someday.'
