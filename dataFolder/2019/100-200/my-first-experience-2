Text: "It was in 2003, I have been in Indonesia by the president programm \"Cadres\
  \ of XXI century\". As the representative from my country (Kyrgyzstan), i was studing\
  \ there about 1 year and received too much experince. Even if I was 18 years, too\
  \ young for my age and that time i didn't go out even to the regions of my country.\
  \ I learned english, saw many people (students) from diferrent countries. I still\
  \ see in my dreams some memories about my first travelling to the unknown \"at that\
  \ time\". \nAfter travelling every mind getting change? fnd neither did I. I started\
  \ to earn more than my parents in my 20 years old in teaching of breakdancing. I\
  \ think, i made many things not lied to my age.\nNow I'm 34 years old, I work in\
  \ diferrent places just be alive every day. I became rich in too young age and now\
  \ I'm living every day as the last. Thanks for reading my old, but real story..."
