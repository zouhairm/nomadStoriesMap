Text: My father being in the army and that too a doctor he got posted to a new station
  every third year and we as a family always got excited to explore a new place a
  new city and i feel that this was always there since childhood the excitement of
  getting to meet new people always made me excited. I still have fond memories of
  different stuff i discovered at different places due to the climatic change of the
  different areas i got to see mountains rivers and lots of greenery and then i saw
  desert areas one of the beautiful things were hospitatlity of the areas we had lived
  in then i have the memories of catching  fiireflies and lady bugs in some parts
  of the country which was the magical part of my childhood. Its always brings an
  adrenaline rush to know the unknown although somewhere inside of you there is a
  fear that what will be in store for you so you gotta take the leap and explore to
  overcome that fear and also add up to the best of the experiences of your life.
