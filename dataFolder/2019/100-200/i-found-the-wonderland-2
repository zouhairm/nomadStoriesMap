Text: "People say I have two personalities. One, where you find me serious, curious\
  \ and well, not so interesting. Second one, it's when I'm travelling; funny, unstoppable,\
  \ energetic and smart. I would like to tell you why. Because I wasn't born as a\
  \ tree, I wish I was a bird though. \nI was lucky to grow up in a land where travelling\
  \ in a few hours gets you from a desert to a forest, cross the green mountains and\
  \ you are right in front of the sea. \nIf you can just sit with me, I'm going to\
  \ share what I have found so amazing in my hundreds of trips in my precious wonderland,\
  \ that you will surly give up on being a tree. Oh, are you too have wished to be\
  \ a bird? still join me. I'll fill you up with my stories and take you where the\
  \ bird version of you would want to go. Just sit with me. \nI'm Safoura. It's name\
  \ of a bird."
