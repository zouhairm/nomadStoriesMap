Text: "Me and my family went on vacation to Bahamas. We hired a tour guide. He was\
  \ very humble and funny man. I remember one incident happened. While roaming around\
  \ I was very hungry. I asked him to stop somewhere so I can grab something to eat.\
  \ He said why don\u2019t you pluck some fresh fruits from the tree. I asked him\
  \ is it legal to do that. He said yea, he parked on the street. There was a house\
  \ very next to the parking. I went there and plucked fruits. After 2/3 I heard lady\u2019\
  s voice. Then I saw an old lady with the stick. I freaked out and climbed the tree.\
  \ She was shouting. After 5 mins my tour guide came and spoke to her for 20 seconds\
  \ only. It was none other than his own \u2018MOM\u2019 I was at his HOME. It was\
  \ pre planned with my mom and dad. We laughed the whole day. It was indeed the best\
  \ vacation of my life. I want to make many mores like that In future."
