Text: This big trip begins in February 2011, I call it "big" because it was one of
  my first departures. my first flight, the second time I changed currency, the third
  time I organized to go to different landscapes. At the time, I did not use Airbnb
  yet which is an application that greatly facilitates the temporary impregnation
  of the inhabitants where one lodges. In the heart of a hotel in Mahdia, I wandered
  to the beginning to see its city center, with always the characteristic iodized
  odor of the seaside. Many tourist shops were  abandoned because we were in a very
  particular election period. The pastries, on the other hand, did not exacerbate
  local customers. A thousand colors in the windows exposed small almond paste cakes.
  My fondest memories are a stroll in a seaside cemetery. A historic door made of
  stone was beautiful and let the imagination build what was nothing but ruins. It
  reminded me of Greece or Italy, where historical monuments have been and are only
  present in writings and imaginaries. Especially I was accompanied by Zied to see
  different places where Tunisian film shoots have taken place...
