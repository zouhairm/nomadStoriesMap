Text: We went to site around sundown as the audio-visual presentation was to start
  at 1845. The structure is imposing, and although it needs renovation and repainting,
  I could imagine how it must have been during its glorious days. The audio-visual
  (visual is more of the play of lighting) presentation is informative.Thirumalai
  Nayakar Palace was erected in 1636 AD in the city of Madurai, by King Thirumalai
  Nayak. The palace depicts the perfect blend of Dravidian and Rajput styles. After
  Independence, this palace was declared as a national monument and till date continues
  to be one of the spectacular monuments of Southern India. The magnificent palace
  is located in the vicinity of the very famous Meenakshi Amman Temple. Depicting
  the Saracenic style of architecture, it was constructed during the rule of Nayak
  Dynasty and is widely considered as the most illustrious monument built by the Madurai
  Nayak Dynasty.
