Text: I'm from Taiwan, born and lived in Taipei until 25 years old. I moved to the
  opposite way, south Taiwan live there for two and half year. I work in a hostel
  and make friends from different countries, I publish magazine interviewing locals
  and people who stayed in the hostel, organize event for travel zero waste and free
  market. During the time I work there, I get chances to travel often to different
  countries by myself, I went to Vietnam, America. I've also been to Hong Kong, France,
  China,Macao and Japan before. My major was film and I have ongoing project filming
  and writing when I go travel. I traveled to Australia by working holiday visa since
  2018,8. I love the diversity in Melbourne and also traveled to several parts of
  Australia so far, Tasmania, Sydney, Adelaide...The journey still goes on...
