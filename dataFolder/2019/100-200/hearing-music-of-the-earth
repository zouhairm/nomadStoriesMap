  \ breeze along with the music of the sea wave. \nAll of it always make me feel free,\
  \ peacefull and calm. YEAH, I know HE is good and never abandon us. \n\nThis island\
  \ bring me the peacefull combination of the earth. Sun, wave, and wind. Being Here\
  \ make me feel thankfull for keeping me alive and safe. \n\nEven walking on the\
  \ beach make me feel loved, there's many services offer in cheap price. \n\nBraiding\
  \ your hair, massaging on the beach with sunset visualization. It makes me leap\
  \ into another world. Heaven on earth. \n\nI always craving to come back. Everytime\
  \ I'm down. These place never fail bring back my strength and power up. Beautifull\
  \ scenery, colurfull sky, even the sound of the wave is like music to my day. This\
  \ place keep remind me that every negative opinion out there is nothing. We just\
  \ a small tick of HIS creation."
