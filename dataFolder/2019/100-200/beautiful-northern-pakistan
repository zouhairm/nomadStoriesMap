Text: "Travelling in Northern Pakistan. When I first told my parents that I planned\
  \ to travel to Northern Pakistan as part of my hitchhiking adventure across the\
  \ Middle East, they were somewhat doubtful. Pakistan is a country which is often\
  \ portrayed in the media as a war-torn hellhole and tourism in Pakistan is almost\
  \ none-existent. Every year, only a very small number of adventure backpackers and\
  \ die-hard climbers travel to Pakistan. Travelling in Northern Pakistan is a truly\
  \ unique and wonderful experience, it can be frustrating, enlightening, life changing\
  \ and, more often than not, surprising. Pakistan is the ultimate adventure backpacking\
  \ destination and if you are a fan of real adventure, it\u2019s time for you to\
  \ travel to Pakistan, here\u2019s why.\nFirst the people of north are simply amazing,\
  \ Unbelievable Landscapes, Everything is possible in Pakistan even raves, Pakistan\
  \ is safe, The Historical Silk Roads, Travelling in Pakistan is cheap then others\
  \ countries, Fantastic Treks in Skardu, Multi-cultural awesomeness, The hash is\
  \ some of the best in the world, Pakistan is an Adventure Playground."
