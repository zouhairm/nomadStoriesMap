Text: "Packing up our van driving out of the grid lock traffic on a Friday night after\
  \ a week of work, childcare and just life. Hitting the four lane freeway on the\
  \ way to an unknown beachside location, that we will find in the pitch black night\
  \ in two hours time. To park, set up, settle our toddler into his backseat make\
  \ shift bed, and fall alseep under the stars of the Milky Way, and to the sound\
  \ of  crashing waves. To wake up to peace, fresh salty air, and our little guy saying,\
  \ \u201CHey, what are you guys doing?\u201D Is my pure bliss!"
