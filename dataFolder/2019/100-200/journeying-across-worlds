Text: This place is not so distant geographically ... but it surprises in an inexplicable
  way. it is as if there exists a portal that connects with a kind of ancestry and
  universal ... a place to disconnect and reconnect with more clarity. the completely
  wild beauty of the littoral zone (the expression I am referring to) is truly wild.
  Some beaches do not have electricity, for example ... even inhabited. We are deliciously
  forced to experience all the imponderables of life. Lamplight, dirt roads ... food
  plans that are possible in this reality. The experience on the Uruguayan coast rescues
  essential values with lots of poetry. Deep!  I highly recommend it, it is a remarkable
  and powerful anthropological experience.
