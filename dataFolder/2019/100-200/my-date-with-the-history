Text: "In my first solo travel to europe i couldn't miss Berl\xEDn Germany because\
  \ i have a crazy passion for the history of the two world wars. And I went with\
  \ some places to visit in my mind. I made a list and a search of a lot of information\
  \ about it. But I never expected to be envolved by the city like it did. It cought\
  \ me by itself. I discovered a young city. Full of vibrant energy and art. Art that\
  \ you can see everywhere you go. Places that at first sight are not so pleasant\
  \ but the beauty lies in that young people have taken to become them an spaces for\
  \ artistic expression. Art that has healed the wounds of a violent and difficult\
  \ past. Erasing the scars that are still visible but what gives it personality and\
  \ invite you to want to know more about the urban culture. I didn't expect all that.\
  \ All those feelings that give more meaning to travel and they also make you understand\
  \ the kindness of the people that you will never forget."
