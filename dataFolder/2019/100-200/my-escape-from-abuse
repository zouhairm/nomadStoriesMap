Text: "Married at 20 to a man who I thought was my best friend. Ran away from a father\
  \ who tortured me into his arms. He was my escape my safe place- or was he?\nI thought\
  \ I was a free woman but I learned I was in a different kind of bondage different\
  \ hand around my neck.\nNow I\u2019m here in Portugal after finding myself. My true\
  \ self. Just before leaving I\u2019ve found someone. Not just someone... the one.\
  \ We made a deal... I help him with a case, he helps me with a place. It\u2019s\
  \ was suppose to be simple. Quick easy family law case. It turned into an adventure\
  \ and one crazy night, just one. I fell into his arms..."
