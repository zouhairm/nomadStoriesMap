Text: The title alludes to the idea, "In Vino Vertias," or "In Wine Lies the Truth,"
  suggesting a person is more likely to reveal their hidden desires under the wide
  array of "truth serums" that Portugal is known to offer.  In my early thirties,
  I first set out to reside in Portugal in 2014 while unwittingly under the influence
  of cult control. It was there I would settle in to worker bee mode with another
  unwitting cult victim who I entered into a marriage of convenience with. After five
  years of living a quiet, contained life under various undue influences, I finally
  broke free from the help of a local Portuguese man who came to my rescue and I fell
  in love with, but later learn to discover would ignite and expose our abandonment
  issues that would become just as controlling, if not more so, than the initial cult
  I felt prey to. After returning to the U.S., dissolving a marriage with a convenience
  partner who still takes up in Portugal, I set out to discover if I ever had any
  deeper ties to the country apart from the ones stemming to the meanings I acquired
  while under cult control.
