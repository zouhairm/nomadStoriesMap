Text: "My eyes stopped at white pale European style church. The Portuguese made in\
  \ during the East Hindie trading period at 17 centuries.\n\nThe smell of egg tart\
  \ from small shop made my feet moves. I can't stand to buy and try one. \nSweets!\
  \ \n\nFive feets from a place I'm standing there's a lot of people laughing while\
  \ preparing a powder.\n\nToday is Mandi-Mandi day. Mandi means showering in Indonesia\
  \ language. But for Portuguese it's means commander. A command to forgive others\
  \ by putting white powder to others face.\n\nIt's once a year tradition. Once you\
  \ become totally white it's means your sins has been forgiven.\n\nA medleys from\
  \ saxophone made me wanting to dance. Time flies but the memories still remains.\n\
  \nThe church, egg tart, Mandi-Mandi, and music are belong to present people. We\
  \ share joy, love and life."
