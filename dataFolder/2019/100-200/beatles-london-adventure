Text: "This sounds touristy, but me and my house mate are massive fans of the Beatles\
  \ so went on a trip to London to find records and pay homage to our heroes. It was\
  \ a short train ride from Birmingham but we went around all of the record shops\
  \ picking up some bargains, but decided not to go to Abbey Road until the main buzz\
  \ had gone. So we ventured to there at 3am, and each did the famous walka across\
  \ the road. We then tried to recreate the roles of Paul and Ringo. Toby took his\
  \ shoes off to be Paul and i left mine on to be ringo, the hardest part was either\
  \ propping the phone up while we took one, or finding a randomer to take a photo.\
  \ This is easily one of my most treasured photos, taken when two best mates went\
  \ away to celebrate his 21st and see something we\u2019ve both idolised from a far\
  \ for ages.."
