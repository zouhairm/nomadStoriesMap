Text: "I traveled to find a undiscovered place where I stay. I travelled on my motorcycle\
  \ putting all safety gears on in searching for a place where I can sit and enjoy\
  \ the nature peacefully. I rode my motorcycle almost for 3 hours and then found\
  \ a place with beautiful lake covered with all side a mountains. The place was amazingly\
  \ beautiful where there was noise of winds could hear. It was totally worth riding\
  \ for 3 hours for this place. Mountains were looking like it has hold the water\
  \ from all directions. Shadow of mountains were reflecting in the water also there\
  \ were people who made simple boat using plastic pipes for fishing. \n\nI sat down\
  \ there for almost 4-5 hours and now when I feel like to get the peace I go and\
  \ sit at that place."
