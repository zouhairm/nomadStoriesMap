Text: Cuba has been a place I would love to explore.  I would love to know the history
  other than what I have read or watched.  I want to get to know the people, and who
  they are.  I want to explore their history, there culture, there food and there
  lifestyle.  Cuba has a great history and as a photographer it has been one of the
  places in the world I want to document.  Cuba has a history in health, history,
  food, politics and other things.  All things I will document and share with the
  world and the cultures at large.
