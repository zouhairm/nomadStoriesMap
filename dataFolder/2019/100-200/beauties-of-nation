Text: "Traveling in carnival, i found simplicity and hospitality in a small vegan\
  \ hostel.\nIn the first day, i dive on the most famous beach os the south of Brazil,\
  \ Rosa Norte, Imbituba-SC\nI met the local surfers who called me to go to a pub\
  \ with them.\nAn extremely cozy and bealtiful pub, Quintal Buti\xE1, and so was\
  \ my first day.\nOn the other day i made some good new friends, we celebrated alot\
  \ while we met new places. I took my camera because i knew it wold be nice to record\
  \ this moments.\nWe went to different beaches, dunes, watherfalls, restaurants and\
  \ parties together. \nI love recording moments with my camera and sharing with other\
  \ people, encouraging everyone to travel and meet beautiful cultures!"
