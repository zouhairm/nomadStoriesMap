Text: 'I went to the hillside areas of Jammu to the goddess Vaishno Devi .Though we
  can choose that plain to reach the main Bhavan(place of worship) but we choose the
  old way to reach there .It was the year 2k12 I was just a kid I barely have experienced
  with this much long traveling.After the hard work and sayings of the slogans "Jai
  mata di" we reached to the main bhavan we started the tracking around 6_7pm by the
  whole night mornings we were just keep walking on those harsh Stony mountains but
  when once speed goes slow the strangers over there keep calling "Jai mata di "n
  heading on.Those three words ...aah! I can''t say what kind of marijuana stuff they
  are containing in them...but trust me everybody who all are in pain just keep aside
  there sluggishness n keep their head high and again start moving on.The oldies over
  there were having a great will to reach the bhavan.they use the donkey pullers to
  take them .The shops in between the hills were like a boon to kids like us...hehe



  I have many more things and stories to write but for now I am submitting this much
  only.'
