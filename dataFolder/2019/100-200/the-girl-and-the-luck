  \ hard-work student who longed to meet new places and cultures. Unfortunately, she\
  \ came from a poor family, and the only thing they could pay was her studies. She\
  \ worked and worked but never got the chance to actually save money for travelling\
  \ around the world. It was her lifeteam dream. She loved studying foreign languages\
  \ because she wanted to communicate with people from different parts of the world.\
  \ \n\nOne day, she went to her college and there was a tree with papers. When came\
  \ close, she noticed they were wish cards which were sticked into the leafs. Therefore,\
  \ she grabbed a small sheet of paper and wrote \"I wish I could travel around the\
  \ world\". She stick it on one of the leafs and went to her class without thinking\
  \ about it.\n\nA couple of weeks later and Laura recieved a call. It was from WorldNomads.com.\
  \ She was selected to take part in a Travel Writing Scholarship in Portugal! Laura\
  \ was so happy. She could finally visit a foreign country and share her knowledge\
  \ with the world, as well as learning from the citizens.\n\nThe end"
