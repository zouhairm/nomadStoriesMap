Text: The story of two cultures,portugal and kashmir india ,resemblances,, differences
  and uniqueness and definitely landscape, i would definitely give an edge of developing
  interest in Portugal because of my favourite footballer christiano ronaldo who is
  from portugal,i love his skills and Portuguese had long history with India as portuguese
  had come or migrated to india almost the centuries before were settled in southern
  India so definitely portuguese and indians share a common bond believed to be a
  very old connection,,,i want to travel to Portugal to explore all aspects of life
  over there ,cultural ,economical,social,political n landscape ,,would love to mingle
  the cultures and try to actas a bridge and overcome the gap between the two,,if
  i would get an opportunity i would definitely explore portugal to my fullest energy
