Text: "\u2018Fernweh\u2019 this has always been my inspirational word, since I was\
  \ 16 I wanted to become a traveller see the world and experience the reality. I\
  \ loved the idea of clicking pictures and writing stories with it so that the world\
  \ can see my travel diaries through my eyes. Not much in my life but I still got\
  \ few chances to explore my country India. I have my traveling page on Instagram\
  \ named missgoodytwoshoes8 where I share\n What I see. In my travel stories the\
  \ most important part has always been nature,I\u2019m an aesthete. I love to see\
  \ and capture the serenity of nature in my eyes and in my soul. Traveling makes\
  \ us grow and my travel stories has always been about nature love Athens simplicity\
  \ and the earths creativity!"
