Text: When I landed in Paris for the first time, I didn't expect myself to fall madly
  in love with every aspect of it. I didn't expect to wander through outdoor markets
  and buy vintage cameras for three Euros, and I definitely didn't see myself getting
  coffee with the first boy I ever loved in the Starbucks at the Louvre.  I didn't
  notice that I was becoming someone better than I had been before, someone kinder
  and gentler. I became more ethereal, more soft, more angelic. I wish I'd realized
  it then so I could've held onto it with all my heart. I'm constantly searching for
  the ghost of the soul I was back then. I miss that version of myself, but I'm also
  excited to find out what other kinds of selves I'm going to accumulate over time.
