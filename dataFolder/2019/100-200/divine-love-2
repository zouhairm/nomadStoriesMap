Text: I love her indescribably. This passion transcends me and everything I know.
  People usually know about family love, friends love, love for oneself, even, the
  love of man to man and woman to woman, but... this is not the same. Does loving
  a same-sex person makes you gay? No, it makes you more human. I met her in Istanbul,
  she dedicated her life to God and she spoke to him five times a day. I did not love
  her at first sight, it took me 28 nights and a tour in the Bosphorus to all in love
  with her soul. The last night I took her hand, it was like holding the universe.
  The stars went up my arm to my heart and joined me with her. I knew I had to let
  her go because having the universe in the hand is divine, not human. It was impossible.
  The next day I left her and she flew. I will never be complete again, one part of
  my soul is with me, the other went to Paris. And it stills there.
