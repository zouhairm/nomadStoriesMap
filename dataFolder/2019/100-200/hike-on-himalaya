Text: 'Himalayas is its own history .there''s many hidden place and calm environment
  cover by snow and vast landscape . when I visit to jalori to thirtan valley its
  feel like heaven top of the mountain view was incredible even you can see crystal
  clear sky its really feel like you are part of Galaxy in night .people over there
  was friendly and good . then I meet with Russian trekker they were like fully equipped
  with advanced hiking tools I learnt lot of things from them . we play music and
  search crystals and get back to camp .

  It was a lovely day with nature and its more than heaven.'
