Text: India, a mystry country. I , myself born in India bt there are some facts are
  still unknown to me. Banaras is the holy place for hindus and our first priority
  when its come for mystry. We visit banaras in the middle of last december.. It was
  cold there.  The biswanath temple was our first spot. The holy ganga made banaras
  the spritually pure. When people die the throw the remaining ash in ganga and also
  they believe ganga can wash your bad energy and turn you in a positive pure energy
  form. There are also many mystry that you can see in the roadsof banaras. Aghori
  , sadhu babas, and also many people are mystry it self.
