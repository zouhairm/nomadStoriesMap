Text: 'One day I was there, in the south of the beautiful country called Chile.

  I met the north of this country and was wonderful with that shiny stars and a really
  big and dry desert cover with many awesome flowers.

  Know it''s turn to meet the south, when I''ve arrived, instantly I sew the wonderful
  view, all cover with big trees and green plants.

  And the people was incredible , they could give you his things without meet you,
  I haven''t seen something like that before.

  When I was walking on the street all people wave me or they gave me greetings as
  if they know me very well.

  I love it and I think the south of Chile is beautiful, with the "Cordillera De Los
  Andes" a big group of mountains, the rivers full of salmons jumping all time as
  rabbits ,and the old trees big and strong next to many flowers and green plants.

  But specially I loved the people from this place, people who seem as if they love
  you as your family.'
