Text: 'Recently i went to Mussoorie ( the queen of hills) in India. I get so much
  freshness and social feel among the people there, i interected with many peoply
  there, and i found no person who made me feel awkward. The breezes came from the
  altitude there was very fresh. The cuisine was so tasteful and the view was fantastic.
  Mussoorie is the place where we find the essence of freedom and joy. It has fresh
  air, respect for traveller and much more things which makes us feel comfortable.
  There has full of adventure, not even daylight but also you will find the best feeling
  of adventure in the night also, An evening in Mussoorie is on 2nd place after Paris.  Mussoorie
  is the new Paris of india,  there has a lovely culture, the government has provided
  lots of facilities for travellers and the local residing people. Their handmade
  crafts has essence of their culture. Everybody who went there is in love with hills
  and the evening view of mussoorie.

  colourful stars and it made the scene of beautiful galaxy in the night.'
