Text: 'We were 4in all, had 3 bikes and an undestined route, wandering and exploring
  we reached to a place known as CHOPTA, located just below TUNGNATH. It has been
  6 days we were still mapping one heaven after the other, but the night we spent
  at CHOPTA in our own 2&3 person tents was the night we would always remember.

  That''s just brief and yes the day we climbed CHOPTA with our bikes, snowfall too
  began the same day, and guess not what we were forced to face and how the snowfall
  gets heavier and heavier, the locals helped out a lot, and then we were rescued
  by a team sent to rescue us. We came back after 2weeks to bring our bikes back and
  that experience was even more hilarious, dangerous and breath taking..!!

  Just the outlines, thanks for your precious time to consider my story and feel the
  blaze .'
