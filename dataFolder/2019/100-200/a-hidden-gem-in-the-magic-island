Text: "Florianopolis is known for its famous luxurious beach clubs and 42 beaches.\
  \ The Magic Island, they said. \nSo normally one would look for the white sands\
  \ to adventure but this time I took a different turn.\nIntrigued by the Concei\xE7\
  \xE3o Lagoon, I decided to hop on a boat line - No, I didn\u2019t mean to say bus\
  \ line- and rode along with locals to see where the ride would take me. Water splashing,\
  \ wind blowing and that perfect sunny day. I was heading to the \u201CCosta da Lagoa\u201D\
  , a still hidden place in the island that can only be reached by boat or hiking\
  \ trails. \nBreath taking Atlantic Forest, right by the water was where I ended\
  \ up. Humble restaurants  owned by fishermen,serving the freashest seafood and delicious\
  \ capirinhas were my companions to enjoy the beautiful afternoon, watching boats,\
  \ windsurfers while relaxing.\nA little piece of the island that remains untouched\
  \ by the glamour. A boat line that connects de madness of a big city with the calm\
  \ simple life of the natives. A gem worth sharing."
