Text: 'One day I met a boy, who turned into someone special, from there he dedicated
  himself to a travel company about wonderful places around the United States, it
  turns out that he decided to invite me, and I became a passenger of a van with people
  from london and korea from the south and I was the first latina that made that kind
  of free tour i had to act as if I did not know it and the group believed it

  , because he planned to take me to know and camp places that I never imagined, it
  was the best experience of my life.:)'
