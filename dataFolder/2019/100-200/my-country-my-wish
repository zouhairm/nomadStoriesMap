Text: 'Hii, I am Veeresh here to say my journey in South India, actually I thought
  my own country is selfish and tolerance but when I attend some of the places like
  Mangalore and near by cities I came to know, if I am cool everything will be normal,
  and I started    to know about some villages background and I got surprised about
  it so I need to go worldwide for know the people''s and enjoy myself and I visited
  for Goa it''s heaven for Indians and other countries brothers and sisters I enjoyed
  more over my journey there i relaxed and I enjoyed in beaches, boating and more,
  and traveled for Bangalore I found myself and started judge the people easily and
  another heaven is Mysore...Palace, clean roads, Devi chamundeshwari temple wow moments.....
