Text: 'A soothing autmn day of October 2018, I was visiting the streets and forts
  of the Jodhpur- the blue city of Rajasthan, India. The shutter of my camera was
  constantly looking to capture something amazing, something which is soul satisying.
  While I was clicking pictures at the giant Mehrangarh Fort, I happen to come across
  one such person with whom I felt some sort of conmection.

  This old man was reason behind my smile and happiness.  How ? I was clicking random
  pictures of the Fort and to my surprise this old man pops up in-front of the camera
  and stood like a still, posing and all so calm. Without him saying a word and without
  me uttering a single word, as if there was a mutual understanding between my camera
  and its subject (the old man), I went on clicking his pictures. At the end of the
  day I felt satisfied and happy not because I got a few good shots of him but because
  one picture made this old man happy and important.  And we moved our ways after
  this- talking without utteringa a single word.'
