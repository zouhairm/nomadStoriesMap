Text: 'At the turn of the 19th-century, an ambitious and curious young Frenchwoman
  endeavors to uncovers mysterious occurrences that have been happening. She risks
  all, and in her hunt is rescued from a fate worse than death, and spirited away
  from her city into a new life as a vampire. She expected nightmares and horrors,
  but comes to learn her new life and home are radically different than she may have
  expected. Though she is aware of new limitations and strengths, she finds she retains
  much of her humanity and questions what she knew of the things she once feared.
  She travels to the depths of the Carpathian Mountains, exploring mysteries and reimagining
  her own sense of self.

  Living a life as what others would call a monster she finds strength, power, freedom,
  and self expression in a new identity.'
