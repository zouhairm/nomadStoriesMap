Text: "My friend and I spent last August in Norway.\n\nOur first stop was Trolltunga,\
  \ 22km of walking through snow, mud, rain, wind and darkness. Two days later we\
  \ hiked Pulpit Rock, almost half the distance, this second hike seemed like a breeze\
  \ compared to the first one.\n\nWe spent the rest of the time relaxing and exploring\
  \ the beautiful county of Ryfylke \u2013 from a 10 Euro/day spa overlooking the\
  \ lake, gazing at the incredible and numerous waterfalls, to aimlessly driving by\
  \ the fjords.\n\nI have always been scared of heights.\n\nIt had been less than\
  \ a year since my foot surgery, accomplishing these hikes made me feel excited and\
  \ liberated.\n\nOn one of our drives along the fjords, we found ourselves alone\
  \ on the road surrounded by endless beauty, I felt like this was my chance to do\
  \ something else I\u2019ve always wanted to do\u2026\n\nWhen visiting Norway, hop\
  \ over to Bergen. it is a beautiful city to visit with its own 5 Star Hostel"
