Text: "Visiting Portugal would be an amazing opportunity to discover the land of Brazil\u2019\
  s discoverers. Besides the language, we have a very similar culture and food. In\
  \ Portugal, I can hear my language, the Portuguese, spoken differently. There are\
  \ in Lisbon a lot of places and good restaurants to be at. Just like Brazil! They\
  \ don\u2019t have Samba, but they have a very beautiful music: Fado. Portuguese\
  \ people is very friendly and cool. They listen to my Portuguese and laugh. And\
  \ we are speaking the same language, but in our ways. I can hear on the radio Brazilian\
  \ songs. There\u2019s Brazilian food everywhere! And Brazilian guys too! Portugal\
  \ is magic. Portugal is fun. Portugal is a piece of my country. Or the inversion.\
  \ Now, I really don\u2019t know: was Brazil the colinized nation or Portugal? I\
  \ think both of them!"
