  Portugal, meaning Port of Cale, reflects what we know: a long stretch of land at\
  \ the edge of Spain, embracing the sea. \n\nSo it's no wonder that Porguese life\
  \ revolves around this, between fishing, sailing, cooking the produce from the sea,\
  \ usually cod, their favourite. It is shared with friends and family while listening\
  \ to traditional fado or folk music and dancing, mainly later in the day, after\
  \ work. \n\nThe other face of Portugal is that of a modern, vibrant country, which\
  \ has to surprise us by how it embraced technology to fit in its traditional setting.\
  \ \n\nHowever, that is probably for the next voyage to Portugal, whether in dreams\
  \ or for real...."
