Text: "Somewhere there\u2019s a Polaroid of us sitting in a bar, you drinking a beer,\
  \ me wrapped \u2018round your arm, smiling ear to ear.\n\nWe paid 4 euro for something\
  \ we wouldn\u2019t keep, searches our pockets for days, the wager to meet,\n\nA\
  \ moment in time, where we could be anywhere, a beer sign behind us, a brick wall\
  \ affair.\n\nMet in the morning and sang you a song,\nScottish boy guitar can\u2019\
  t go wrong.\n\nHe didn\u2019t like the Beatles, but he knew them well, enough to\
  \ sing along with this southern belle.\n\nCoffee and smoke filled the room, stuck\
  \ on our cloths, what the day is to bring, no one knows.\n\nAlong the streets, riding\
  \ back seat of the bike I found yesterday, our Scottish friend helps push us up\
  \ hills, barely making the way.\n\nGuttural laughs and holding on for dear life,\
  \ where we began our day, landed elsewhere by night.\n."
