Text: "I am argentinean born in C\xF3rdoba (center our country) and since I have memory\
  \ I Loved going to Buenos Aires to enjoy life in the big city. Any excuse was a\
  \ great opportunity to prepare my bag With my C\xF3mics, underwear and some candies,\
  \ even when I spent as a kid all day long in meetings waiting for my dad to and\
  \ go to have dinner in a nice restaurant (another passion).\nWhen I was older, in\
  \ one of those \u201Cbusiness trips\u201D, I decided to for a walk by myself and\
  \ feel I was also from the city, but of course I was lost the minute after so overcoming\
  \ my shyness I asked a man in the street how to go back to my hotel, with the Best\
  \ luck ever that he was deaf..."
