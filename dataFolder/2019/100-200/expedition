Text: 'We are four guys and two girls who are recently opened this project, and our
  friend who own a backpacker accommodation here in Dar and also found organization
  thought it will be great if volunteers from the globe will participate on this project
  and he is the one bringing some from his organization at the moment, we are all
  from the slum and 80% the fellow youth have no jobs or skills, so we opened this
  vocational center where we can teach and make other youth be able to employ themselves
  through hand making products,


  We train youths to make crafts, local ornaments, painting, tie and dye, clothes,
  hand bags, bracelets, cooking, local cookeries, in short we make youth to be future
  entrepreneurs,


  We would like to have volunteers who can collaborate with us on helping the community,
  since English is very important we will love volunteers to also teach the youth
  some basic so they can be able to write and speak English'
