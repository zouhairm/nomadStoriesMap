  \ adventure. When she finally gets her passport at the age of 36 after a life of\
  \ hard work and struggles. This is where the adventure begins, with her bubbly nature\
  \ and kind heart. She begins to develop friendships and followers from all over\
  \ the world. The people she meets along the way are inspired and amazing at what\
  \ this truly humbled young woman can achieve. With many unexpected hurdles along\
  \ the way. The young woman takes on every challenge and is determined not to be\
  \ defeated, by displaying mental strength and remaining calm and positive. No matter\
  \ how heartbreaking and rock bottom the situations become."
