Text: 'It is one of my biggest wishes that one day I would become a good writer and
  also I like to travel different places to see and understand the culture of other
  natitons. In 2016 I went to Poland for one semester education, during my studies
  I traveled to some Europe countries and it was one the best opportunity to see and
  write something about their culture, religioni education sistem and etc. But that
  was not enough for me to improve my self very well.

  In this time if I accepted for this scholarship I believe that I can write a new
  and helpful things.

  Right now I follow some travel writer via twitter, facebook, instagram and etc.
  I also want to be one theme.'
