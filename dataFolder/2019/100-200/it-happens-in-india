Text: "It all started when he left his dream job to follow his dream. Never thought\
  \ it will be that easier than it was. With some dollars in bank and a notepad of\
  \ fantasies, he stepped up. His dream was never to tell anyone, how much he'd travelled\
  \ or what he'd seen, what he'd experienced, but to write a story which everyone\
  \ reads, story of his dreams. \n\nIt was last night, I guess 3 am! When phone alarm\
  \ buzzes and called for getting ready to take the first fly, for the first destination.\
  \ There was a nervousness in heart, like a new born baby feels of coming in new\
  \ world.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n... and one day he reached where he wants to reach, a wonderland,\
  \ a dream place or something else. Lil hard to define and easy to breathe. But was\
  \ that the end of his journey..\n\n\nHis story of his \"dream\" journey."
