Text: "Lugo is a municipality and city of Galicia, Spain with about 100,000 inhabitants.\
  \ A charming city with a Roman Wall that marks its Celtic and Roman origin, the\
  \ historical features are intense, the buildings are rustic and Lugo has two World\
  \ Heritage Sites: Cathedral of Santa Maria and the Primitive Way. But the city does\
  \ not only offer historical places, there are beaches to take the leaf, the cathedral\
  \ beach is one of the most famous, the culture is remarkable and the gastronomy\
  \ emphasizes flavors like Lac\xF3n with grelos. Lugo is fascinating, and propitious\
  \ a leap into new flavors, cultures and landscapes, a leap into a unknown that is\
  \ worth being known."
