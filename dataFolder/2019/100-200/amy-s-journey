Text: Hello! My name is  Amynah, I am 23 years old, I am Brazilian and I always wonder
  what is or what is my life journey, I confess that there are many things that I
  want to do or practice. I've had some experiences that added me to the answer to
  that question. I love to know new cultures, I know more than 7 countries and I can
  say that my journey began or I know and experience with these very different cultures
  of Brazil and this has added an amazing feeling to me, but it is time for me to
  decide what journey to my life will have and I believe that this discovery will
  be made in Portugal, a curious country, beautiful culture and brilliant people who
  will contribute and I will contribute in a unique way.
