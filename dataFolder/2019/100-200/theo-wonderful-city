Text: "Verily, I did not expect to find Rio de janeiro in this life. I have seen this\
  \ paradise since my childhood but just by TV. So, my honeymoon toke place there.\n\
  In the first day, I knew the famous downtown. Literature Achademy and the Lapa.\
  \ What a beautiful vision. \nIn the second day, we were given more adventure spirit\
  \ and took subway to discover an unkown place. The greatest challenge was a tourism\
  \ guide. Our friend assigned to follow us did not go to the airport. We knew Rio\
  \ the best possible manner because we talked with hundreds citizens asking informations.\n\
  In the third day, we thought we were in our local city, we called the hotel address\
  \ our address. Until today."
