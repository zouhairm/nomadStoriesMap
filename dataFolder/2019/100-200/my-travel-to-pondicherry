Text: "Pondicherry...it\u2019s not just a place, a beautiful destination which is\
  \ filled with French architecture..The restaurants are just among with delicious\
  \ French style food.The old buildings located in French colony just blown me away\
  \ and the rock beach is one of the adroable beach which is so pleasant and marvellous.It\
  \ is mostly a chill out space for most of the people around the French colony.My\
  \ second day visit was to Auroville.It is considered to be the meditation centre,\
  \ possibility where we can see many of the foreigners around who come there in order\
  \ to meditate and get inner peace.I consider it to be one of the most peaceful place\
  \ where you could ever be to.\nIt was a journey with so many exeperiences,bliss\
  \ of happiness and a wonderful journey. As a overall all i can say is it if you\
  \ are missing out to visit Pondicherry then you missing something in your life!"
