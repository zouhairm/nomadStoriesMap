Text: Back in february in 2018, i was in Lisbon for 2 days by myself. I was studying
  in Madrid a semester of my bachelors degree in International relations and my mood
  in life was to take every opportunity that was offered to me. So i took the night
  bus from Madrid to Lisbon, not knowing what to expect but i was ready for the unknown.
  On the evening of the first day, i found an area with an stunning view of Lisbon,
  and i took a seat on a bench and a young man was playin' the guitar and singing
  a song in english. I stood there for i don't know how long just listeting to the
  guy play and collecting my thoughs about how precious every moment is and lucky
  we are to be getting to know the world and the amazing humans, places, memories
  out there.
