Text: 'Last November, I traveled to Japan. I come in the fall. The first time I set
  foot in Japan, a feeling of peace had entered my heart. I am in Tokyo. One of the
  metropolitan cities that is crowded with human workers. While in Japan, I found
  many extraordinary things, which I have not found in my country. Japan is a safe
  place, a clean place, neat streets and a very disciplined people. I was very amazed
  to see the design of the city and the residents there. I really want to stay here,
  someday.

  However, I found a speck of dust on the third day I was in Japan. The dust was when
  I saw trash falling in front of a group of people, but those people did not take
  the garbage and then continued to walk. I know, they have a plan not to take what
  is not theirs or take care of matters that are not their business. However, is that
  speck of dust a form of individualism that makes a sense of indifference in humans?'
