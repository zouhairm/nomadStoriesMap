Text: I would love to live specifically for these days, for all the moments, for all
  those landscapes that make me stop traveling through time in search of few perfect
  moments. Its because of these moments when the voices inside me wont shut up & I
  am about to quit, something reminds me of them & I stop, moments which gives me
  a purpose, moments which make me feel alive on the inside, its because of these
  moments that I am still breathing!!! This brokenness inside me would start healing
  itself. Out there when I am travelling. I am totally someone else. I thought may
  be ill find myself,  if I could just come in. I swear I'll leave, Won't take anything
  else but jus memories. I have started believing that travelling to different places
  can sometimes give me all my answers. Its about where you can find ur magical world.
  And i have found mine in traveling to dreamy destinations all over the world...!!!
