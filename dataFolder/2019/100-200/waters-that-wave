Text: "India is more than a country full of colour and culture. There\u2019s a charm\
  \ in it\u2019s safe haven of secrets. These secrets, you\u2019ll discover speak\
  \ to everyone differently. \nThe quiet recluse, the shadow of a shack and waving\
  \ at the waves becomes, quiet honestly, a writer\u2019s paradise. All you have to\
  \ do is take off your shoes, feel the warmth of the sand through your toes, make\
  \ your way to the water and then it\u2019s all you. You can stand and let the waves\
  \ do all the talking, you can jump and scream with the water or you can just run\
  \ into it and splash your way to happiness. There\u2019s one thing for a certain\
  \ the water will always wave back. And you will know one more thing about you, when\
  \ you\u2019re done. Like I said, the secrets reveal themselves differently to different\
  \ people. That\u2019s because more often than not, they reveal what you\u2019ve\
  \ never been able to see in yourself."
