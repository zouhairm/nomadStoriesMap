Text: 'Location:- Vagator, Goa.

  After trekking through the woods behind Chapora fort I saw a way to Vagator. So
  I chose the way down to Vagator, through the woods, then to go by the road. And
  there I was at the Vagator, less crowded with beautiful scenic beauty. And adding
  to the amazing view, the weather suddenly changed. While relaxing at the shore,
  I got this urge to run by the side of tides. It was such fun when a beautiful girl
  from Paris named, Vienice noticed me and started running with me. And we still talk
  now. This what adventure does to you, it leads you to unknown places and introduce
  you to lovely people and you realise this beautiful life has got to offer so much
  that we just need to embrace or just open our eyes to.'
