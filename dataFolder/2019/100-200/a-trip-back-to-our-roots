Text: In Brazil, a mixed race country, everybody has something that connects to Portugal.
  Maybe a last name, which all the Silvas and Oliveiras and Santos can relate. Maybe
  it is a recipe, like our popular snacks with codfish. Maybe it is just the language,
  spoken by all of us and that connect us to them. Whatever that is, Brazilians grow
  up not knowing a lot about their history and roots. Once we go to Portugal, we understand
  our traditions, our habits and of course, how to cook that perfect codfish with
  potatoes that only Portuguese grandmas can teach. Connecting our history and our
  roots is important to find out who we really are and to understand how big the world
  is. And that connection is only the beginning for bigger stories.
