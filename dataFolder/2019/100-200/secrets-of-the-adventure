Text: "Imagine you can open your favorite book in a gorgeus place. Imagine you can\
  \ smell and hear the ocean just a some steps of you. It's tuesday morning and you\
  \ forgot about that, cause your new friend is talking to you about her last time\
  \ in here. Three years ago, she said, this restaurant used to rent little boats\
  \ to sail during sunset. Each one of visitors're able to swim some meters towards\
  \ the sun light, and everybody could remember a piece of their countries from that\
  \ moment. But now, everything has changed, and you hoy tell her: imagin\xE9 you\
  \ can live a great experienceexperience in Portugal acompannied by a mexican style.\
  \ Now, she look at hoy, quite interested, why not? She answered. And start walking\
  \ down to the sea together. Ready to jump in a wild way; fearless. Portugal has\
  \ begun in your words. Are you ready? ... Stop imagine. Start traveling. Voy only\
  \ live once."
