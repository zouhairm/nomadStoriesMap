Text: When I visited Banyuwangi village I found any misterius place before it. Like
  macan putih viilage. It was an old viilage which has saved big history about tradition
  of biggest king at Javanese kingdom. Between ritual of old Javanese king we can
  talk about Moksa. It's a ritual with clean of human self with semadi. After fasting
  until long time, an old king would gotten a message from the God. Kusuma Wijaya
  king lived at Blambangan kingdom and followed this ritual and lost his self. Before,
  he was a famous king with other king in Javanese kingdom. He learned About life
  and religion. He believed everybody has choice to learn. Thank for your attention
