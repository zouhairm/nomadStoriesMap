Text: "To describe very short what the story is about, it\u2019s exactly about what\
  \ the title says. A story about how spontaneous ideas, decisions or connections\
  \ lead to happiness and the feeling of true happiness. It\u2019s my personal travel\
  \ story of my time in Taiwan, when I biked around the island, 1.110km in total.\
  \ A trip I planned beforehand, but turned out completely different. Already from\
  \ the beginning it changed from what I planned and with every minute on this beautiful\
  \ island, it changed so much. It was much more than I ever could have dreamed of.\
  \ Because of what i experienced, because of the people I met, this trip ended completely\
  \ different to what I first expected. Also my biking route turned out completely\
  \ different and with huge achievements for my personal self. I felt truly happy\
  \ during the whole time and would like to share my story to inspire people to try\
  \ something crazy."
