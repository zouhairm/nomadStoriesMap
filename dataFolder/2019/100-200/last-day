Text: 'I I can not say it was the best and greatest travel of my life but it was life
  changing.

  It made me realize how poorly we think about time. I was in a little cozy town with
  12 000 people and for an entire year it was my home. I always though "i have time
  to do this" and so i slept on everything I wanted to do. But i don''t regret it,
  i had plenty of time to do more thing such as, learning german (which i never learnd
  the right way), making new friends and exploring all the cities that i could go
  to. I was living day by day but not as if it was my last day there.

  My travel story is about my good moments and my bad ones, cause not everything is
  pink color.'
