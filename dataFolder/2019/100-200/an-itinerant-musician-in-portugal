Text: As a guitarist i have traveled all over the world playing music with locals.
  Music provides a level of connection with locals that may not otherwise exist due
  to language and cultural differences. Musicians will seek each other out and music
  provides an instant connection. Local musicians will often approach me when i'm
  playing in a park or beach and we jam. This invariably leads to invitations to peoples
  homes or music related events where one gets to know local people and participate
  in the real local culture first hand. I would like to travel with my guitar and
  use it and music as an avenue to connect with local people and learn about their
  lives and music and culture.
