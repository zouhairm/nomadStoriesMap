Text: "I fell in love with him at first sight. The tall blue-eyed Dutchman was the\
  \ most beautiful man I've ever seen. I was ready to dive with him into the pool\
  \ with my head. So I did. On the second day of our holiday in Turkey, on a cool\
  \ summer evening, we decided to walk along the pier. Suddenly, my handsome prince\
  \ wanted to dive from a high pier. The height to the surface of the water was almost\
  \ 2 meters. I didn\u2019t know how to swim, so I was extremely skeptical of the\
  \ adventure. However, love stupefied his head and eclipsed common sense. Already\
  \ in flight, holding my hand in the hand of my beloved, I realized how much it was\
  \ a risky and ill-considered step into the abyss. Reaching the water, emerging and\
  \ realizing that I was still alive, my feat was rewarded with a passionate kiss.\
  \ It was a real leap into the unknown."
