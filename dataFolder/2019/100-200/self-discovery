Text: I've always wanted to travel.  Ive never had the money to travel.  I love learning
  about new people, places,  etc.  I would like to enrich my life with more culture
  and knowledge. I've never won any contest in my life. If I win I will show everyone
  that anyone can win. To show people to never give up on their hopes or dreams.  To
  make a positive attitude and positive difference in people lives one word at a time.  To
  stop the stigna associated with travel. To show people they don't have to be afraid
  to travel to anywhere.
