Text: "Fades to >Black is Zane Bartlett. A young nomad with failing sight. His poetic\
  \ blog will take you on a journey only Zane could pave. He suffers from a condition\
  \ called Retinitis Pigmentosa. A condition which slowly will fade his vision to\
  \ black. These tales dont require sympathy. Zanes optimism for life out weighs his\
  \ disabilty and the bigger curiosity for Zane is the condition of mortality. \n\n\
  Follow Zane as him and his wife drive Eveyln there newly acquire temperamental 96\
  \ Ford Escort through North America. Ride the highs and lows of an inspirational\
  \ young man as he treks North. Zanes wit sparks conversation and leads him into\
  \ the hearts and homes of all walks of life. He asks the questions which ponder\
  \ life, death and what if everything \u2018Fades to Black\u2019."
