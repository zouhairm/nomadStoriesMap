  \ ablut managgening a fly fishing lodge in patagonia, 300 km from home, clients\
  \ from USA, a fly fishing world (leap into unknown\U0001F643for sure) its been the\
  \ begining of the kind of life I was trying to live. \neverything was new for me,\
  \ peolple from the farm, clients, my english was not so fluent, but my life did\
  \ a 360 jump in a couple of days.\npatagonia, as you know, is incredible from wherever\
  \ you watch it, amazing places, rivers, mountains, animals, emotions. so thats what\
  \ happens when you spends almost 6 months in the middle of nowhere, you start feeling\
  \ like you are part of it, and thats what happend to me."
