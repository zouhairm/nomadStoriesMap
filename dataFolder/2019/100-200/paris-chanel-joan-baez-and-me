Text: 'There was no way I was going to get to Paris, but no way I could miss the final
  tour of my teenage music hero, Joan Baez. While at 77 she may still outlive me,
  my chances of ever hearing that wild-ocean voice of peace I''d loved for 40 years
  were slim. Unless...

  My old school friend Chanel bought two tickets to the show. Said she''d fly in from
  England if I flew in from South Africa. Another high school friend sent me an airplane
  ticket. I sold everything of any worth that I owned - washing machine, fridge, furniture
  - and booked a tiny apartment in Montmartre with Chanel for the weekend. I didn''t
  expect any of this - the Fare Thee Well tickets, the airline ticket, the glorious
  old green door that led to the room we filled with laughter. Mostly, what I didn''t
  expect to find was tears, rolling down my cheeks, as Ms Baez took to the stage and
  sang to me... "Goodbye is too good a word, babe... so I''ll just say ''Fare Thee
  Well''.'
