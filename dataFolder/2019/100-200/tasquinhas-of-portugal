Text: "Portugal has a culture of good food; throughout the country there are myriads\
  \ of interesting restaurants and typical small tasquinhas (small taverns).\n\nWhat\
  \ better way to connect with a country than the exploration of its food, eateries\
  \ and dining customs. \n\nNot to forget Portuguese wines have enjoyed international\
  \ recognition since the times of the Romans -- who associated Portugal with the\
  \ god of wine and excess, Bacchus.\n\nMy travel story will explore (aka taste/eat)\
  \ what the locals enjoy at football matches, concerts, festivals, day-to-day. And\
  \ how the food has changed to accommodate tourists (and where to go to enjoy the\
  \ real food of Portugal); also regional delicacies are a must to try."
