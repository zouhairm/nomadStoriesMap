Text: "Adventure is the word that I use to replace the term travelling, backpacking,\
  \ holiday, or trip. Much energy and time have been wasted on debating the definition\
  \ of the aforementioned terms. I recall Rangga\u2019s statement in AADC 2, in which\
  \ he explained the true difference between travelling and holiday. Travelling is\
  \ the daring act to take risk and flexibility, which seeks to prioritize process\
  \ over the result itself. Adventuring for me has been evolving over the years. It\
  \ used to be a hobby, before it went to turn into a must-have. I used to go on an\
  \ adventure when it\u2019s holiday or I have a lot of free time. And now, for the\
  \ sake of life balance, I traverse the globe in search for an adventure.\n\nNow,\
  \ the feeling to go on adventure is way more immense than last couple of years.\
  \ Thanks to the abundant annual leaves, that made it possible for me to arrange\
  \ my adventure. Back in college years, I cut my meal allowance in order to go on\
  \ an adventure. Now, it\u2019s easier to go on an adventure because finance is no\
  \ longer a major issue."
