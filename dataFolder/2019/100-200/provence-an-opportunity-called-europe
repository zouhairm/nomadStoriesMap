Text: "Provence is a mix of mystery and nature. Nice welcomes me with the sun and\
  \ makes me feel again in Italy. But I'm not in Italy, and I'm not even in France.\
  \ I\u2019m in Europe, a place of peace and progress. Europe is in many things: the\
  \ lighthouse in Cap d'Antibes, the multiethnicity of Marseille, the alleys of Saint\
  \ Paul de Vence and the rain of the Alps at Moustiers Saint Marie.\nThe lake of\
  \ Saint Croix and the gorges of the Verdon have a European horizon. Try to climb\
  \ up to the Trescaire Belvedere and let your imagination travel without boundaries.\
  \ A journey in the journey. Europe is everywhere, in the  projects financed by the\
  \ European funds and that have made Provence a better place to live."
