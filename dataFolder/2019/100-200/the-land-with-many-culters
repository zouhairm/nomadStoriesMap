Text: "Koovagam is a village in the ulundurpettai taluk in Villupuram district in\
  \ Tamil Nadu.I hope everyone knows about the Mahabharata war in India,in which the\
  \ kauravs and the pandavs fought heroically.But the pandavs won because of a very\
  \ big sacrifice made by Aruna\u2019s son Aravan.As the story goes before the Mahabharata\
  \ war a Kshatriya bodybhad to be sacrificed but at that time only Krishna and Arjuna\
  \ had flawless bodeis but they could not be sacrificed as they were to play more\
  \ important roles in the war.So Aravan Arjuna\u2019s son came forward to sacrifice\
  \ himself for the benifit of the Pandavas in the war.So when Aravan was asked what\
  \ is his last wish,he replied he wanted to marry even of it is for just one day.Then\
  \ Lord Krishna appeared in the form of Mohini and married Aravan.This single day\
  \ marriage is celebrated during Koovagam Transgender festival as Lord Krishna\u2019\
  s form that day was of a Transgender.And since then there has been a temple in Koovagam\
  \ where Aravan is worshiped in the form of Koothandavara."
