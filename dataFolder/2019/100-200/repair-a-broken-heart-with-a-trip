  \ i go to travel, i meet new people with amazing views about life. I drink and eat\
  \ new stuffs, i hear about amazing stories about love, selft conection and healing\
  \ ways to live. \nNever before think about all this knowledge, my entire world was\
  \ remove and clean, now i now how a have to feel every day, i learn about life with\
  \ other point of view. I know, the real conection and love happen in day by day,\
  \ face to face, word yo word un zero smartphones or social media, all the people\
  \ who love me and i love them, live less un rrss and more in town, next to me, to\
