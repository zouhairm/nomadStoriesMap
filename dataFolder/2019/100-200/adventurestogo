Text: "I am eighteen years old and finished the school recently. Now I have wanderlust\
  \ and want to travel the world with my best friend. We are friends since ten years\
  \ and we have never been outside of germany. With our education we are ready to\
  \ try new things and experience new cultures, lots of people and adventures, who\
  \ are waiting for us. My goal is to explore country\u2019s before I face the seriousness\
  \ of life. I have members of my family in Portugal who I never saw in real life\
  \ before. They told me the country is one of the most beautiful country\u2019s in\
  \ Europe and I have to visit it. I\u2019m young and broke and can\u2019t afford\
  \ a trip to a country without support. So I hope you will help me seeing members\
  \ of my family and travelling the world. It would fulfill a lifelong dream from\
  \ me."
