Text: I Travel the world not because I like to, travel but because it's so much to
  see and discover, the world it's full of unknown places and beautiful people to
  meet. Traveling is your own wikipedia waiting to be found and explore. It's the
  only college diploma I want to have in my life. Since I was 18 I had been traveling
  the world and Everytime I go to a new destination I discovered a new place, food
  and culture, its like reading a book you never want to end. Travel for me  it's
  not just a reason to escape from life but a reason to see the world though me!
