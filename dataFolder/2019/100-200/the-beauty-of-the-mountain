Text: 'I did not know that my story would be so exciting at the end, but I learned
  a lot from it

  I had the passion to visit a village in the high mountains of Tizi Ouzou, Algeria,
  to discover how to live and how life is there, even though I am aware that it is
  difficult due to the difficulty of terrain and lack of resources to meet daily needs

  But when I arrived in the area after a long journey from the capital to the village
  of Naith Erathan I had to go over a mountain and then climb up to find the village.
  The weather was cold at the beginning of December but I decided to overcome it with
  difficulty because the area on the high mountain and on a rugged road

  After an hour and a half walking three kilometers, I found myself in front of an
  unparalleled beauty. The sun was shining above the houses of the villagers, and
  the view of nature was breathtaking. I never forgot that day, because it was rooted
  in my mind for how beautiful it was.

  Really worth visiting and climbing the mountain for that'
