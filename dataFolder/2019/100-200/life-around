Text: My passion to explore and never settle has led me to travel, meet new people
  see their work and at times also work along with them, and trust me that is the
  best time I live. In the course of years I have found the stories behind these people,
  places and their work so mesmerising that I felt that it should be told to the world.
  I am fascinated by the smallest of details, stories and things and find so much
  life in them and thus, I started recording them in the form of photos and videos
  and occasionally through words. It has kept me inspired, rejuvenated and strong.
  So as the explorer of life I am and want to document these life stories which are
  so close yet untold to be told to everyone and for everyone to get encouraged.
