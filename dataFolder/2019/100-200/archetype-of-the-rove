Text: Travel is being the source for stories to many people around this earth.Well
  may be ,who knows Aliens may even travel for stories.okay trying to be serious now,I
  think travelling changes you from inside,no Matter, wherever you wander,you will
  explore the place and yourself.some places will shake you,some places will abduct
  you,some places will abandon you but every travel experience makes you strong and
  chisel you a bit like a antibiotic it prepares you for the next risky experience.This
  happened to me when I visited Himachal Pradesh,That time I was stressed out of work
  and travelled to get lost in nature.The journey was pretty smooth and more like
  a detox process.when we are about to return,I saw an old man crawling down with
  hands ,he used his stick for support.This disturbed me a bit and we offered for
  help ,he responded with smile and refused with thanks.This may   not be a unusual
  incident but it really inspired me to stand on my own legs and never give up on
  self love.I remember the quote "Go out and let the stories happen!".let the stories
  happen to you as well !
