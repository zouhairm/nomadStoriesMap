Text: It was a day in January 2019, I had planned to leave Salzbourg to Hallastatt,
  but with the snow it turned into an adventure, changing many trains, taking buses,
  arriving in a city where it was difficult as hell to walk, and no shop open. was
  kind of cemetery with the snow, and also the few people there. but I think that
  this day, made me understood that adventure and travel where made of souvenirs that
  you cannot create, or imagine before leaving. from that moment, i used to expect
  that kind of adventure each time I travel. being surprise is for me the best way
  to enjoy a moment and create souvenirs and stories to tell. The snow was amazing
  and put the landscape in great conditions, even if walking was really hard. also
  this story show that nature, in interrail, is amazing and has a lot of influence
  on the way you see the places you go or visit.
