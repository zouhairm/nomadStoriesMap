Text: I entered 12 to Dulwich Library in a hurry and sat next to a woman who looked
  indian to me for some reason. Anyway, like the usual I put my earphone on and played
  girls like you while looking at all the other passengers in the bus. At the corner
  of the bus opposite me, I saw a father and his son in a crib. Looked like a loving
  father to me, patting his sons head playing with his hair. The father was doing
  something in his phone, looked like he was texting someone. But to my surprise he
  put on a cartoon show and handed over the phone to his son, again playing with his
  hair. I had a feeling he was a single father until the woman next to me, yes the
  woman who looked indian to me for some reason, stood up and went next to her son
  and husband.
