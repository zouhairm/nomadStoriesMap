Text: 'My name is Mohamed Silimi, Health and safety engineer, I''ve been selected
  to participate in international training in Lisbon 2013, at our company head office,
  for 05 weeks.


  It was an extraordinary experience, I met people from different nationalities, with
  different cultures, we enjoyed the time in classroom and also in the Hotel, in Lagos
  Park, Porto Salvo, we were surprised by the hospitality of TD hotel staff, and with
  the delicious food.


  In the weekends, our tourism guide who assigned by the company, took us to discover
  the city, we had the chance to visit a lot of places and monuments, Lisbon is very
  nice city, warm people there, we made a friend there and we still connected till
  today.


  Special thing happened during my journey, was meeting with Portugal football players
  in the hotel by the occasion of world cup qualification match against Sweden, we
  took pictures with the players, I shake hand with the Don Cristinao Ronaldo my favourite
  player.


  With the end of our training, we left Portugal with great memories, and with best
  wishes to come back another time.'
