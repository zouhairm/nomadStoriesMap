Text: As a young free spirit woman, I am very outgoing and adventurous, I do not have
  the fear of the unknown and love meeting new places and people. I always travel
  withing the borders of my country, currently when to Durban ro experience their
  lovely beach, stay in Johannesburg where I always take my trips from. In my hometown,
  I'm forever traveling, which is taking three trips a week. This is because I am
  not restricted to staying in one place and because I have stayed in places like
  Free State(Bloemfontein ) as well as North West(Mafikeng). Being exposed to many
  different places at a very young age gave me the advantage of  coping well in a
  different environment I be in contact with.  Back in high school I was doing tourism
  which taught alot about traveling and being a tourist.  As a 21years old female,
  I utilize what I learnt in tourism to make it my everyday lifestyle, as I'm forever
  traveling.
