Text: India is a country with different cultures and traditions. I went to several
  place like kashmir, Himachal pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab. The kashmir
  trip was best ever for me. The kashmiri kava freshens the mind, soul and mood.  The
  beauty of kashmir can't much explain in words rather than experiencing. The humour
  which we used to see on news channels is not like the same. Its a calm city. The
  charming valleys, the romantic views, gardens etc.  The real beauty is snow covered
  mountains and the frozen Dal lake on the shore of which Hajzatbal shirine is located.
  The street food of kashmir is awesome like rogan josh, goat biryani, chicken biryani,
  kashmiri tea with baked flour balls. The weather is awesome.
