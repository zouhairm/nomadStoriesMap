Text: "Roaming around the streets of Mumbai, watching out the mesmerizing beauty of\
  \ the city that never sleeps it is very surreal to see lots of stories in each place\
  \ I visit, whether it be local trains, food stalls, street shopping or big malls\
  \ and restaurants there is a different story which each one has to stay about Thier\
  \ struggle and hustle which can inspire thousands and still they deal with everything\
  \ so simply and with a smile. India is very vast and each state and city describes\
  \ it's own beauty holding the wonders in Thier space. Taj Mahal the reason why people\
  \ still believe in love and no matter what either be an outsider or an Indian no\
  \ one will ever fail to see that beauty made for Mumtaz by her love! Each and every\
  \ place holds a significance and value and here there are holy places too where\
  \ you can just get yourself mad in the world of bhakts and surround yourself with\
  \ peace and nature! Hence it is said it's incredible yet beautiful \u2665\uFE0F"
