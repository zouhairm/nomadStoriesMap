Text: "That tour was the best tour of my life...  Saw a many countrys people are visiting\
  \ that place.. Most of the people are coming in winter session...  Because in winter\
  \ session the tree,, the roads as like also roof of the all shops are under covered\
  \ by ice....  Snow fall are just outstanding....... Look like a European city...\
  \ In that time I thought I'm walking in the clouds....  You can find the best place\
  \ of shimla when you go to the 2000 ft up from the mean sea level.... You Can see\
  \ also how the wind is working on clouds level...  At last that was amazing view\
  \ and the amazing tour ever I reached \U0001F60D"
