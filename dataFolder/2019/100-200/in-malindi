Text: '"On the brink of the Indian Ocean, a hundred kilometers away from Mombasa,
  there is a city called Malindi. Fine sand, lots of smiles, little money. It is not
  easy to get to Malindi: an invisible line cuts it out from all the rest. There,
  behind that line, is where lost things end up; where dreams, people and streets
  end.

  There, in Malindi, is where the world ends. But the world doesn''t know."


  My travel story takes place in a city that I visited during my trip to Kenya, Malindi.
  I live in Italy, and Malindi was totally different from my reality, from everything
  I had always seen and known before. I wanted to tell the story of the people who
  live there, of everybody who can''t always tell his or her own.'
