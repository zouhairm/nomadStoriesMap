Text: "Hey. Let me tell you a real story that take place in train. Few years backs.\
  \ I booked a train to chattisgarh from bhopal.As i got lower berth on booking but\
  \ exchange to upper berth bcoz the uncle was too old to climb the upper berth. But\
  \ unwilling i exchanged my berth.now i am in upper berth.i was uncomfortable as\
  \ it is too much hot in upper berth. By adjusting myself to this heat,i saw a girl\
  \ next to me .she was quite pretty.i was like just fallen for her. She ignores me.\
  \ Now cut two hours of staring she asked me for charger. I gave her & conversation\
  \ started. Meanwhile in conversation we discovered that we both have many things\
  \ in common.talk continues. & We are so much busy in conversation she forget that\
  \ her station she was about to departure was left behind. Bow she departed in my\
  \ station & after that i dropped her in her place by my bike it's a 2hour journey\
  \ .we exchanged numbers. We dated. That's all \U0001F607"
