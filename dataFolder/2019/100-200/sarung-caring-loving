Text: Indonesia is a beautiful country, not only with amazing natural and sea views,
  but the way they socialize, respect each other and serve guests, there I can feel
  familiarity with residents in each region I visit, one day when I became a tourist
  guide in Sabang island, we as locals, feel very happy to serve guests who come down
  from cruise ships, not only take them to beautiful tourist spots, but we are also
  very passionate about learning English, because we want to feel closer to the tourists
  who come, I hope someday I can go to other countries like Europe to share stories
  about the beauty of our country and feel the beauty of European nature and feel
  the social conditions of the people there, hopefully it will be a wonderful experience
  for me to tell my friends in the my village
