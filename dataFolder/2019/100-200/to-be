Text: 'I have always wanted to travel the world but have always been limited by resources
  and finances (I have resorted to explore my current surroundings & making it work
  with what I have). Being a photographer, a writer & an explore is a unique skills
  that brings the world to life. Seeing the world in a different view, meeting different
  people &  being by telling your own story - bringing it to life in your way. Also
  finding beauty in all elements that life has to offer.


  The world is a beautiful & interesting place waiting to be discovered/explored -
  engaging & including the masses into this wonderful treasure by writing the experiences
  & engaging the people.


  Different in my own way


  To be....'
