Text: I grew up in Miami, rich with secondary Cuban culture. Growing up, I lived through
  the Elian Gonzalez saga and was an impressionable young man taught the story of
  Cuba through one lens. When I had the opportunity to go, I was fascinated to find
  out first hand what the Cuban culture was like. And I wanted to discover it on my
  own terms. I flew to Havana, bought a bicycle, and after a few days, started riding
  with no direction or place to go. I went with the flow of the people I met, the
  stories that attracted me, and scenery along the way. I got a hands-on experience
  of everything Cuba had to offer, and it was different than what was pitched to me.
  I came back with new perspective, and it is this story I want to bring to life and
  share with the world.
