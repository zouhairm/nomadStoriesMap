Text: "Everyone has dreams, but has different effort to achieve it. \n\nI had a lot\
  \ of dreams, of course, everyone had it. My biggest dream is to travel around the\
  \ world, to see the unknown, experience the unexperiences, and to feel 4 different\
  \ seasons in different country. It's not easy, it's never been. I work hard and\
  \ travel when I can, at least 1 different country each year. Early this year, I\
  \ travel to Japan for the first time, I've seen snow for the first time at Shirakawa-go,\
  \ and it was so beautiful. I will never forget what I felt when I'm playing in the\
  \ snow, the wind chill, and the beautiful white scenery. Right at that moment, I\
  \ feel very blessed and gratefull that I'm alive, healthy, and still had a chance\
  \ to travel. One day I know, there will be a time that I cannot go travel anymore,\
  \ so I'll live for this moment, reaching my dreams and will never stop until I can't\
  \ do it anymore."
