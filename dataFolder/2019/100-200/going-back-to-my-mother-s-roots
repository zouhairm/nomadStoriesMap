Text: My mother is Portuguese.  I have family that live there in Portugal. I have
  never been. I'd love to see my long lost family. Interact with the Portuguese people
  and eat there food. See what there culture is like. I enjoy traveling and want to
  again. I'd write on my blog and post tons of pictures of myself and the things I
  witness there. My great grandmother last name was Rocha on my mother's side of the
  family.  I have found out thru fb that's a very popular last name there. I would
  take this opportunity in a lifetime in a heartbeat.  Thanks again.
