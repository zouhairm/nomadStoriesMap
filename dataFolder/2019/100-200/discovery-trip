Text: "When I was studying in Senegal I went with the students on an exploratory and\
  \ training trip.\nWe went to the borders of Senegal, 700 kilometers from the capital.\
  \ The number of US was  about 600 students came from Senegal and Mali from different\
  \ nationalities when we arrived in  the place \nWe started to get up early in the\
  \ morning and we prayed and we went to do some exercise and we come back to eat\
  \ breakfast and we went to a beautiful tourist place where there were two mountains\
  \ facing ;one of the mountains where the water is falling like beautiful waterfalls\
  \ and between the mountains there is a pool of water and a cold place without l\
  \ the sun rays ; we washed us from the water and we walked back To the place and\
  \ another day we went to another place to explore it is a village on the top of\
  \ a mountain inhabited by ancient people do not know the problems of cities and\
  \ not civilized they had  the trade of precious stones and tourism revenues and\
  \ there are some giant trees and it was a really discovery trip."
