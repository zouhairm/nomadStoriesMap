Text: Among all these uncaring people, there was a man that said a nice word. Walking
  down old Egypt is hard as you meet up with various people but they all have one
  thing in common which is that they want to reach their target place no matter what
  would happen. You can see a guy shooting at a woman because she wanted to pass and
  he was blocking the route. When everything goes bad and you hear one of your family
  makes fun of you and how you look like in front of a strange man, you feel very
  bad but this one time you find a good heart defends for you and you end up with
  this belief that there's good in people.
