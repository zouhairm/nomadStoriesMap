Text: The story begins from the College. As a photographer, I love traveling and finding
  new places. As a part of being a photojournalism student its a very important part
  to explore the area and also get to know the locals. Making a local connection was
  difficult in the beginning because of the language,but more and more getting into
  the local made it easy make a Connection. Ooty is such a nice place who lives mountains,
  stars and cold and friendly people. There are lots tourists attraction spot and
  also adventure seeking points. Since there are wild animals in the forest area it
  is a great risk to go alone into the woods.
