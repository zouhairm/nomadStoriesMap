Text: Is incredible how important could be travel, and is not because the stamps in
  your passport or your photos in instagram, it's because when you are traveling you
  can meet incredible people from everywhere, different cultures, taste different
  food, learn different languages, but the most important lenguage and is the only
  one that you can get an answer wherever you go is the smile lenguage.  That's what
  I wanna find in Portugal. I had the honor to met some portugal people in Asia and
  Australia and I can tell how friendly and nice people they are. Also one of my dreams
  is to learn the sexy Portuguese, with the strong accent and for sure the smile that
  they always wear.
