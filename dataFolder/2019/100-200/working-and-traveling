Text: I am a lecturer of private university in Palembang, South Sumatra. One of my
  main activities is related to research. After doing a research, I will write an
  article and disseminate it into seminar or conference. Few years ago, there are
  so few seminar or conference held in my home town. So, I almost attend seminar or
  conference inter islands. The journey to disseminate an article is not only related
  to business only but also enriches with some sigh seeing activities. Recently, I
  interested to disseminate my articles overseas. I have present my papers in Australia,
  Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia for sure. I want to explore more countries as well
  in the future. The journey to America will give a huge experience for me
