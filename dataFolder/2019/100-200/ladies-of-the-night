Text: 'Ladies of the night, a dive into the world of late nights, bright lights and
  smoke-filled air that surround the women who have subjected themselves to a world
  of transaction-al sex due to poverty, molestation and financial-affiliated factors.

  Their grief and numbness, their fight for survival and their reason for holding
  on to such a life. their hopes, aspirations, needs and desires and most of all their
  cry for help.

  their struggle in the business and the maltreatment from the men and society in
  which they were born into. these women cut across various destinations, sizes and
  characters as i give them a voice to  state their fears and regrets.'
