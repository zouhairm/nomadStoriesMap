Text: "When I first arrived in Portugal I was completely alone and completely lost.\
  \ All I had was a map. Thirty five hundred dollars and a small room my parents had\
  \ rented me. This was going to be my college graduation present and I literally\
  \ picked Portugal out of a hat. \n\nMy other options had I chosen while blindfolded...\
  \ Barcelona Spain, Rome Italy or two weeks in thailand - the only thing these trips\
  \ had in common was my inability to speak the language. \n\nIt took me two weeks\
  \ to learn the basics of Portuguese - \u201Chello\u201D, how are you? \u201C my\
  \ name is Keri and \u201Cwhere is the beach?\u201D \n\nFunny when I arrived I had\
  \ forgotten most of it. \nGood thing my cab driver spoke a few different languages.\
  \ With out him I may have never been able to see the sites I\u2019m about to share\
  \ with you today."
