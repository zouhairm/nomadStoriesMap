Text: "As someone who was fresh out of college and had nothing to look forward too,\
  \ I decided to go on a vacation with my best friend. A budgeted trip and the hunger\
  \ to explore we set our foot on our way to Pondicherry, a union territory in India.\
  \ We travelled by train and because we did last minute reservations, we had to share\
  \ the sane seat for almost 12 hours but it was all worth it. Pondicherry has beautiful\
  \ beaches and amazing food. Everything that we set out to explore was done and apart\
  \ from the travel which was a task, our trip was smooth even though not very luxurious.\
  \ \nMy parents love traveling and so every year we went out to travel the world.\
  \ However this trip was extremely special because I was alone with my best friend\
  \ and we felt like the world was at our feet and that we could explore anything.\
  \ The freedom which we felt was exhilarating to say the least."
