Text: I spent a month in Greece some years ago. It was a wonderful adventure I will
  remember for life! From the beginning, I collected wine bottle labels every day
  from our aperitif wine each evening. They featured table wines as well as other
  samples. It was a happy trip, rather a respite in remember! We met young men to
  date, wine to ingest, sites to explore and remember, motorcycles to crash on, and
  about all the things necessary for a trip to Paradise. At the end of the trip, during
  our foray to Mykonos, I was unfortunately injured in a motorcycle accident when
  we hit a bridge abutment. I finally understood why my parents had always admonished
  me to avoid them, but, being up for one last adventure, I chose to "forget" that.
