Text: "I spent 8 weeks in Ethiopia, I was mainly at the capital Addis Ababa. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find the weather so cold considering the fact that it\u2019s in Africa.\
  \ I\u2019m African and where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s so hot and from what I\u2019\
  ve read, I expected the whole of Africa to be hot as well. \nIn Addis Ababa, I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find the people so welcoming and nice and also, patriotic. Ethiopians\
  \ have a huge respect for their country, culture, food and so on. I didn\u2019t\
  \ expect to find such a high level of patriotism there and I felt really welcome.\
  \ \nI also didn\u2019t expect to find a large number of foreigners at the capital\
  \ I felt almost at home. I had fun exploring the countryside of Debrezeyit and Langano.\
  \ Also, I tried the local food injera and I didn\u2019t expect to find it tasty\
  \ and almost like local food."
