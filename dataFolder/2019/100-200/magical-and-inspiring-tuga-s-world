  \ made me feel happy. I prefer being in Hostels to know people, i love to take pictures\
  \ and i m very happy because i have just bought my first Canon. \nI  have worked\
  \ being a manager in a company, i m responsable for all social medias and branding,\
  \ i organize events and in all my vacations i trabel abroad. \nI know Portugal and\
  \ i love this country, my grandmother was born in S\xE3o Pedro do Rio Seco, Almeida\
  \ and this year i will get my European passaport.\nI like different things, i love\
  \ design and make me fell free. Travel is everything to me and i made a choice,\
