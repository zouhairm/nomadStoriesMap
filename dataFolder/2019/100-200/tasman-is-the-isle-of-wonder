Text: Leaving the mainland and arriving in Launceston stomach in knots but head full
  of questions, we drove to our first stop. The highlights of the trip were visiting
  Cataract Gorge and riding above it on mechanised chair similar to a ski lift. The
  Bees are big and blue and seeing the monkeys in a little part of the local park.
  Walking up to a lookout in Wineglass Bay was breathtaking and humbling. Salamanca
  markets was bustling and humming with different smells sights and sounds. Visiting
  Port Arthur was a solemn and thought wrenching day, hearing history and reading
  the vivid accounts of struggle torment and torture was painful.
