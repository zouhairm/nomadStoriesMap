Text: "I am the author of eight best-selling business books. \n\nFor my next book,\
  \ I have studied our future \u2014 how artificial intelligence, machine learning,\
  \ robots, data, and analytics will drive our future.\n\nOr will they? Is that really\
  \ the key to what Shakespeare once called the Undiscovered Country \u2014 the future?\
  \ Actually, no. Not at all.\n\nWhat I've discovered is that our future lies in our\
  \ past, in what makes us who we are \u2014 our values, our dreams, our fears, our\
  \ hopes.\n\nMy hope is explore those foundational ideas in Portugal, that Portugal\
  \ is the portal to our future by looking deeply into it's people's souls, experiences,\
  \ hopes and dreams.\n\nMy hope is to discover our future in Portugal's past and\
  \ in its people.\n\nMy hope is that this scholarship affords me the opportunity\
  \ to explore our common threads that pull us into the future, by exploring Portugal's\
  \ unique past that keeps us grounded as we also soar into the future."
