Text: Covered under the shield of autum leaves,the terrain was beautiful but throwing
  punches on my feet as I went high up to the mountains.Reaching on top all my tiredness
  fainted away as I saw the beautiful panorama,a mesmerizing view,a source of peace
  & happiness.As I looked at the sky it was the time of dawn beautiful sunrays touching
  my skin, peeking & saying goodbye. The sound of water from a stream flowing by my
  side was like a beautiful piece of music.As I was enjoying some time alone when
  I saw an old man with a stick walking barefoot on those sleepy terrain taking his
  flocks of sheeps back to home.He approached me while I was sitting on an old fallen
  tree trunk& said "Namaste".It was a sweet conversation with him as he told about
  his days there in mountains.I wanted to know more but it seems I have to wait till
  tomorrow as it was dark now with the moon now sparkling  lightsinto the sky.My day
  end with complete  peace as I went back to my tent with a complete excitement to
  explore the mountains next morning.
