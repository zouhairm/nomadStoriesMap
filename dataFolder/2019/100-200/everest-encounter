Text: It has to be on our trip to Nepal we hopped in a car with some of the locals,
  this took us to the rice fields of Bagmati and we were able to see mount Everest
  in the distance from the lookout point.  Towards the end of our one week trip  we
  took a mountain flight with Buddha Air on this flight we met travellers from all
  over the world.  The flight took us to Mount Everest where we saw some amazing views
  of all of the  Himalayas it was amazing seeing Everest up so close it looked like
  an almighty beast, it was amazing what mother nature can produce, i will never forget
  it as long as i live.  As soon as we landed, we went to celebrate and talk over
  a few drinks and traditional Nepalese food.
