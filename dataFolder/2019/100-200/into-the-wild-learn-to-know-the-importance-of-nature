Text: I would like to travel to a wild and untouched place by man. I would like to
  sensitize myself and those who follow me on the importance of nature and the environment
  that surrounds us. Too many times, man thinks of himself first rather than respecting
  his own ecosystem. all of us should think deeply about climate change and what we
  can really do to improve our planet, starting with small precautions we can carry
  out every day. each of us like to escape from our polluted cities and take shelter
  in uncontaminated places. instead of doing this we could begin to return as much
  as possible to the past.
