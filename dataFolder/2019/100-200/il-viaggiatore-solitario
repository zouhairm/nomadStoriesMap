Text: I have lived in Texas my entire life. I live in the suburbs where there is a
  lack of phenomena and creativity, so as I search for myself in the love-quilted
  city of Venice I hope to uncover more about myself than I have learned thus far.
  As a member of the lgbt community and a sufferer of bipolar disorder, I have had
  a great deal of struggle in terms of identity and my future. I am longing to journal
  my experience into an entirely new country as well as write to people like me. I
  want to give everyone a voice. This isn't a love story. This is a self-discovery
  exposition. As I journal of the lost pieces of myself I am able to recollect in
  Venice, I would love to document the culture and differences between the lovely
  country compared to sweet little Arlington, Texas where I have lived for the last
  eighteen years.
