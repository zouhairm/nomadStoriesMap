Text: "i am an traveler. and this is my story, i live in  a city where we don't have\
  \ time for our own self every one is in hurry every one want to rushes.all we care\
  \ is money but  once i go to an place where everyone looks like me but the  have\
  \ different ways and standard of living they share there time they care each-other\
  \ they have time for each other they don't work for money they work for there development\
  \ for there pride for there satisfaction they serve there services for other. no\
  \ old homes are there they want sunset they can smell the fragrance of  air they\
  \ know how rain feels when drops touch there cheeks \n and they do rain dance they\
  \ can look the colors they don't only text each other they talk they touch they\
  \ live for each other, is this paradise, \"cities are so beautiful but so alone\"\
  .i wish to be simple but be realistic i don't want to die on Internet i want to\
  \ die between my love ones life is beautiful in the middle of nowhere......................"
