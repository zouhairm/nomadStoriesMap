Text: Well, how can i start this story? I always dreamed of visiting Brasilia, but
  i never had the opportunity until 2018, when i went to college and got through it
  to travel to the famous Brasilia. I had a very different view of the city, in my
  imagination i expected so many building at the same way, without any interventions
  or characterizations of the residents and users of the city. But the brilliant architect
  Oscar Niemeyer planned a city that surprises everyone. Your project in the shape
  of an airplane is the most characteristc of Brasilia, with your curves that represent
  the sensuality of brazilian women. So after meeting Brasilia from corner to corner,
  i learned that when we travel we have to erase averything we know about fate so
  that we have a bigger surprise and excitement
