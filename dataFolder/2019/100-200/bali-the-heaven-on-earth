Text: "We see beauty in portraits, life in nature, and magic is definitely real in\
  \ Bali. \n\nWhen it comes to high mountains beautifully colored by green and beautiful\
  \ forests Bali has it. When it comes to the cliffs with splashing waves on its chest\
  \ and with mesmerizing sunsets drowning in the amidst of the bluest oceans. When\
  \ it comes to golden sands that covers its shores and the grains that tickle your\
  \ toes when you stroll on its beach it has it all. Bali is a sensational island\
  \ with an exceptional stunning views with the most breathtaking scenery and activities.\
  \ \n\nIf you are looking to be connected with your senses on all levels, spiritually,\
  \ physically, and go on endless journey to pure joy and enrichment then Bali it\
  \ is."
