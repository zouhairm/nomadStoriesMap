Text: "An unwritten story can be the cultural heritage a person takes with themselves.\
  \ No matter where you travel to. Or how you travel.\nMy main character will be an\
  \ african slave sold to the New world. He is a Griot from Senegal, or another country\
  \ in that cultural area: Senegambia. \n\nHe and his family are instrumental in developing\
  \ the mexican marimba and harp music. \n\nIt will remind readers of a Saga like\
  \ \"Roots\" by Alex Haley and be gripping like \"Outlander\" by Diana Gabaldon.\
  \ Based on historical facts, it will uncover the connection between mexican songs\
  \ like \"La Bamba\" that have deep roots within traditional african music. While\
  \ it develops a passionate story. That will speak to international readers. Especially\
  \ readers who love to travel. Or would love to travel.\n\nThe african diaspora involved\
  \ many stations and countries. I would like to get to know countries such as Portugal\
  \ and the portuguese way of life. I would like to develop characters that come to\
  \ life while reading because of the historical accuracy."
