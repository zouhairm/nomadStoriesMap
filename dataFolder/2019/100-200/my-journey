Text: "Me and my friends spending our holidays in Sikkim,  Kolkatta, Raipur,  and\
  \ we had lots of fun we get to know the place very well.\nThe best journeys don\u2019\
  t just show us the unfamiliar \u2013 they help us understand it. In these stories,\
  \ our nomads dive deep into the local culture in search of the beliefs, desires,\
  \ and history behind the customs.\nTravel to me is all about rejuvenation and learning.\
  \ It is taking a break and exploring how the life and times and gain some perspective.\
  \ Every place has a different story to tell and as a traveler, a researcher, and\
  \ a teacher, I feel it attracts me even more. So this time, when my friends and\
  \ I were planning a trip, Sikkim was already decided for we had heard a great deal\
  \ about the place."
