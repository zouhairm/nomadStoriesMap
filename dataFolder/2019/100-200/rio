Text: "\"Give up, as I gave up. Dive into the unknown, as I dove. Do not worry about\
  \ understanding. Living surpasses all comprehension.\"\n\u2500 Clarice Lispector\n\
  \nToday, during my last stroll through Rio I encountered the writer Clarice Lispector,\
  \ whom I admire. I saw her sitting by the sea. Of course, you may think, you happened\
  \ to see one of those statues on the boulevard. Yes, that is true, but I swear I\
  \ saw her. Staring at the sea, I could notice words sprouting out of the water;\
  \ everything was poetry.\nAfter bidding farewell to the city at Jobi bar last night,\
  \ this morning I decided to go for a walk and enjoy a contemplative view of Rio.\n\
  The city offers shelter through the sun and the hills. It smiles back at you with\
  \ every gaze.\nThis last day is no exception; its streets, nature, people\u2026\
  everything stimulates the senses.\nGoing back to places where one was happy may\
  \ entail a high risk, but when you take it with conviction, it becomes a lifelong\
  \ learning.\nDuring a ramble along Ipanema, a man plays the saxophoneat the square\
  \ to earn a few reais. Certain familiar notes can be heard: \"Tristeza n\xE3o tem\
  \ fim, felicidade, sim\"."
