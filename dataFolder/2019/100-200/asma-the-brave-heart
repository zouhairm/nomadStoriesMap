Text: "My grandmother was a beggar. She had to beg for us. My mother died during my\
  \ birth. I have no memory of her. My grandma raised me and my four cousins alone.\
  \ My only aunt committed suicide because of her husband's torture. After losing\
  \ both of her daughters, my grandma only fought for us. I still remember how she\
  \ used to collect leftover paddy from the paddy field after sunset. She used to\
  \ beg in front of the mosque and bazaar. She sold everything to raise us, even her\
  \ only suitcase that was my grandfather's last memory. Now we are grown up, living\
  \ in different places, working for life. But our love for grandma remains the same.\
  \ My four cousin sisters and I send money to her every month. We bought furniture\
  \ and repaired our house. Nowadays, she is not doing well, I asked her what was\
  \ her last wish. She asked us to promise that we would never mistreat any beggar\
  \ if they come to us for food. She said, 'I pray for every single soul who fed me\
  \ and all of you. There is no greater pain than hunger'\n \n- Asma"
