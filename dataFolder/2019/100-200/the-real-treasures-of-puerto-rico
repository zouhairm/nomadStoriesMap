Text: "I love Puerto Rico. Every time I visit I find something new. There are so many\
  \ stereotypes about this amazing island(s) and the people who live here. Yet every\
  \ time I visit I find evidence of the opposite. The most generous, kind, warm people.\
  \ And amazing geographic diversity. You can eat world class food and discover up\
  \ and coming artists. You can drive down a bumpy country road, park under the trees,\
  \ put on a mask and discover another world just off the shore. You can hike into\
  \ the mountains and cool off in an idyllic pool under beautiful falls. Did you forget\
  \ to bring water? No worries - there are no strangers in Puerto Rico. Someone will\
  \ offer you a cold water or the omni present local beer Medalla. \n\nI have met\
  \ so many people that feel like long lost friends. \n\nLet me introduce you to one\
  \ of the most warm and welcoming places I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of discovering\
  \ and rediscovering."
