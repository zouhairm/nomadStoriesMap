  \ of the world, i sell all my stuff at home to begin my travel and buy the cheapest\
  \ fly, this takes me to uruguay were i stay for some months. Working in what i find\
  \ and making new friends, after that i take a bus to brasil, and stay there for\
  \ some time trying to learn the lenguaje and make a life without it. After that\
  \ i go to argentina making friends and learning all the culture i can in my way\
  \ to be part of the population and live like them. Thats how my travel begin. Actually\
  \ im in U.S.A. \n\nMaking family all around the world with just my backpack and\
  \ my camera. Producing my life and learning new things.  I dream to go all around\
  \ the world one day. To share great time with new people."
