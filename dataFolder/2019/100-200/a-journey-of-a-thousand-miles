  \ abroad. But this time, little bit far than i though. At first this is only our\
  \ joke to talk that we (me and my friend) planning to go to Japan. Basically this\
  \ is the further country that i really want to go - compare to other country that\
  \ i\u2019ve ever visited. By the time being, my friend agree to go together with\
  \ me. So, both of us trying to make a plan from buy the ticket, looking for the\
  \ accomodation, etc.\nFast forward, the day is come. No experience at all. This\
  \ is the first time for us to go to Japan. A thousand miles away from our hometown.\
  \ We arrive there, such a beautiful country, with friendly people. We only know\
  \ a little about Japan. At last for 5days we\u2019ve been there. All the time we\
  \ spend the short trip there was awesome. Behind this our journey to unknown. We\
  \ had the best experienced during it."
