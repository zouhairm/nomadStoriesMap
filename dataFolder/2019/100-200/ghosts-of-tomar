Text: I was in Portugal once. I went on business and my job was to move a research
  group there that later became the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown. (Zach) I
  went around a bit and found that the Convento in Tomar to be the spookiest place
  ever. This was where the Knights Templar came to be blessed before going south to
  the crusades. They were blessed in a church that was built to accommodate them on
  horseback without getting off the horses. This was the last stop for them and it's
  all a very complicated story. Ghosts howl at you from every corner. Can't describe
  the chill when you first see it.  I would have liked to talk to some people there
  about this and give voice to those ghosts, but had to move on and frankly, didn't
  have the skills.
