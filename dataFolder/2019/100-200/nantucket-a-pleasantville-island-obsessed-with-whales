Text: "When you think of nantucket you imagine chads, millionaires, lobster rolls\
  \ and ros\xE9 wine festivals but you\u2019d be surprised!\n After staying there\
  \ for 6 months, you get to know the story of an island trapped in time, that gives\
  \ you the feel of being the star in the Herman Melville novel. The perfect gray\
  \ tiles houses, even the mailman truck and the bus are dated! At night, no matter\
  \ where you are you get to listen to the seawaves.\n Nantucket is definitely a total\
  \ different chapter of USA, where locals care for the environment (for example,\
  \ street lights are prohibited in order to not damage the animals) and the local\
  \ farming is 100% organic. Get to know the real american charm by visiting the local\
  \ farm Bartletts Farm and taking part of the \u201Cpick your own tomatoes\u201D\
  \ festival, or enjoy an also retro and close to perfection old cars parade and hat\
  \ contest! in the Nantucket Daffodil festival. In big ol\u2019 \u2018merica also\
  \ less is sometimes more."
