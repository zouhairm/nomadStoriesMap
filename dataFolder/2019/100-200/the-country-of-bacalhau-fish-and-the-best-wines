Text: "Portugal is one of the bests places YouTube can find fine wines , bacalhau\
  \ fish and the swettest \"Pastel de Bel\xE9m\".  Portuguese is their main language,\
  \ If you speak portuguese as me It Will be really easy to walk and talk around,\
  \ but If not Spanish and English Will be Fine too in turistic placas. Portugal has\
  \ beautiful Beaches and gorgeus historic places as well as their culture. One of\
  \ the most visited beaches is Caiscais, a beautiful Beach with a sunset that shine\
  \ in to your soul. For the cullinary you definetly need to try the \"bolinho de\
  \ bacalhau\" it's kind of fish fried with floor and Olive oil the taste Will be\
  \ unique in your life, as well you need to try the \"pastel de Bel\xE9m\" also known\
  \ as Portuguese custard tart is a Portuguese egg tart pastry dusted with cinnamon.\
  \ They are also popular in former Portuguese colonies and in other countries with\
  \ Portuguese populations. And of course their wines, red and white both are exeptional,\
  \ with a Lot of Varieties, and for dessert they have a Sweet wine called \"vinho\
  \ do porto\" as know as Wine Port, the sweetest Wine that You Will prove."
