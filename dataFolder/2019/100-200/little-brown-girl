Text: "There are so many Black people; especially Black women who do not travel or\
  \ who do not know what else is out there in the world. They remain in their own\
  \ bubble in the same neighborhood dealing with the same things that generations\
  \ before us have dealt with because of what they see or think that there\u2019s\
  \ all that exists. Me being a Black woman exploring a place that I do not know about\
  \ and exploring areas that people in my neighborhood and country will show that\
  \ there is nothing different in our cultures than theirs. It will educate others,\
  \ see what the locals do, & to encourage them as well to explore outside of their\
  \ comfort zones. It will be me exploring \u201Cneighborhoods\u201D, discovering\
  \ what they do, cook, do for work, what they contribute to their families, explorations,\
  \ etc. it\u2019s a way to connect to other people."
