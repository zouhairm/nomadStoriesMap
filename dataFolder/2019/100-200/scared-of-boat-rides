Text: "Last year a traveled to Gujarat for a visit to dwarika temple i was excited,\
  \ we get along in a boat to that island in afternoon and while the time we were\
  \ on that island we forgot that we have to get back early as that was a windy day\
  \ and tides were occurring in that sea we got late and didn\u2019t got any private\
  \ boat to travel back so we went along in public boat and there the scary part started,\
  \ the boat was full of 55 passengers and wind was at a good speed and at that night\
  \ i was so scared as boat was tilting again and again there was so much chances\
  \ that we could have drowned at that night but by having faith in god we get back\
  \ safely to th port back ."
