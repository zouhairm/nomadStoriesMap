  \ to find a place where you find that instant connection with the people , food\
  \ , culture , and many divserve communities that fit into your dream destination.\
  \ That\u2019s how I felt when I first Arrived in Canada and it really inspired me\
  \ as individual and made me realise not all Of us will get out wishes but when and\
  \ if they do make sure to capitalise on it because it\u2019s once a lifetime opportunity\
