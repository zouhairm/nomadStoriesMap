  \ aspects that will help me to connect with Portugueses one of them is the language,\
  \ Even though the Portuguese has differences from Brazilian Portuguese the connection\
  \ wil be natural.\nI was born in a city calls S\xE3o Vicente in state of S\xE3o\
  \ Paulo and I live since my 8 years old in a favela called Mexico 70, a lot of people\
  \ that grew up with me was took wrong paths, besides that reality I always looked\
  \ for my dream, discovery the world by Sheyla. Yes by sheyla once the perspective\
  \ change everything. \nBuilding a connection with people around the world, get exemples\
  \ of reall life, real people that change the odds and make your life as a champion\
  \ dream. New ways to dance, study and discovery everything."
