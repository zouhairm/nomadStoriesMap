Text: "Ever felt the urge to do something, but never have? Samsara is a girl who's\
  \ a wanderer, but never has come close to having an experience that brings out the\
  \ magic in her. \n\n(Im not great at writing, but it's always been away for me to\
  \ put out my thoughts. It's also been away of putting down my creativity, imagining\
  \ myself being in the story. Im not expecting anything by sending this over, as\
  \ I'm just letting myself go and literally jumping at opportunities. If y'all do\
  \ take a look at this, all I need is someone to help me get my ideas out and get\
  \ creative with words. Hopefully then I'd write a book of my own) \n\nThis story\
  \ will bring out the soul of a writer who is in a constant battle between herself.\
  \ A girl who lets out the wanderer in her and jots down her experience of the travels\
  \ of life"
