Text: "Before a Hello there is a smile. So the traveler is sure to go further, he\
  \ went out, took his backpack and his boots took care of the rest.\nOnly the clock\
  \ mov\xE9s until he met two walkers with whome he took the opportunity to share\
  \ the good, and at night they drank the cheapest wine in front of the beach and\
  \ above it was the milky way.\nHe writes it so that the sensation is recorded in\
  \ ink, maybe it doesn't rhyme, meybe it doesn't have coherence, but each letter\
  \ will serve as a time machine and will return it to that beach to watch that show\
  \ of stars, to feel the cold wind of the Patagonia and that infinite talk.\nThat\
  \ was his memory.... A free souvenir"
