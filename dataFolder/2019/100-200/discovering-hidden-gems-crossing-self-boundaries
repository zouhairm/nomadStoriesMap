Text: "\u2018Discovering Egypt\u2019s hidden gems, crossing self boundaries \u2018\
  \ ... we travel; leaving our homes heading to discover new places. But actually\
  \ traveling is a journey through our minds and beliefs ... in the present time to\
  \ discover the past and reshaping the future! \n\nEgypt is full of many spots, rich\
  \ with tangible and intangible heritage. All what we need is an eye opened,  an\
  \ ear to hear the silence, and a mobile to take photos and write stories. May be\
  \ we need to analyze, connect fragments; stitches on a dress, hair cut, courtyard\
  \ in a house , or even a pattern on the skin of a fish. \n\nWhat can add to this\
  \ experience is reflections on ourselves... in other words, reading our ideas, feelings\
  \ in this specific moment. I\u2019m now passing by a complete transformation in\
  \ my ideas, let\u2019s say revisiting my believes. The reason of this transformation\
  \ is that last July I discovered I had lymphatic tumor.  Moreover, many complications\
  \ may lead to not being able to have kids, and I\u2019 m not married. \n\nTraveling\
  \ is my way to fight, to resist and allow this transformation."
