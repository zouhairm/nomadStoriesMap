  bike. I will tell the story how to commute between each side the country and see
  new things along the way. I believe on how the diversity as human being can easily
  connected as we are still the most socialist mankind on earth.

  For every road I take, I will share also the originality of culture which stay in
  their life until today, try to chapture the most beautiful and unique places to
  encourage other traveller to visit. Which definitely will improve the local tourism
  income in the future.

  experiences.'
