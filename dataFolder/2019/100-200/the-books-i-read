Text: 'I didn''t expect to find so much love and dreams in my travels. I am familiar
  with the world and he is familiar to me. Each new journey showed me so many different
  things: love, passion, pain, suffering, joy and especially dreams. I''ve been to
  a lot of places, mostly in the US, but I can say that I visited several continents,
  I saw the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, the Great Wall of China, the famous
  cemeteries in New Orleans, I drank in the temple bar. And in all these places, I
  didn''t expect to find parts of me, lost in different places of the world, thrown
  in the wind in search of a path. But most important of all is that i didn''t expect
  to find all this in the books I read.'
