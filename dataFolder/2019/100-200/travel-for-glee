Text: 'Traveling to an unknown place expecting nothing but to enjoy every single second
  you spent with the person whom you love the most is an incredible experience, that
  not even money can measure the happiness lovers feel.


  Thailand is a beautiful place to travel, with all the alluring beaches, temples,
  historical places, smiling faces of Thai people together with the delightful foods,
  and distinct culture can captivate not only tourist but such lover who wanted to
  discover the beauty of a certain unknown place.


  As I discover the beauty of Thailand, visiting one place to another leads me to
  understand how Thai people give importance not only to their culture but also to
  the preservation of the beauty of their country.'
