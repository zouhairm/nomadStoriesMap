Text: I was with my x husband.we went to abroad for the first time. I went to most
  of the places their where in one city is surrounded by one side sea and another
  side mountains and one side plain. So we can  see all types of nature their.Their
  we also see a beautiful street like in Paris. We went to a very beautiful village
  their we eat hot dog and we want to buy a sugarcane honey, but we got late so we
  are enable to buy that but it's k. So then we next day shifted to another hotel
  near beach. Their I want to go to beach at night but he didn't allow me so we fought.
  N next day we came back to India back.
