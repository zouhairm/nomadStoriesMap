Text: "I remember taking the train somewhere. I was exhausted from carrying too much\
  \ luggage as usual, just seeking to rest for a few hours. It was bloody hot outside,\
  \ all I wanted was to enjoy the silence and to sway by the gentle movements of the\
  \ train. I hadn\u2019t fully closed my eyes when an Indian family entered the wagon,\
  \ probably counting 8 or 9 people in total. Kids running everywhere, the adults\
  \ in deep conversation close behind me. I decided to listen for a bit. The way each\
  \ of them paid full attention to one another and understood to let each other talk\
  \ impressed me. Completely calm and with thick accent the man said: \"What you feel,\
  \ in your last moment of life, that is what\u2019s most important.\" And there I\
  \ was sitting, blessed to have not fallen asleep."
