Text: I left for a month-long road trip to the eastern countries. Poland, Hungary,
  Slovakia, Austria, Romania. I am very interested in the culture of each country,
  gastronomy and architecture. my favorite is poland, people seem very distant, we
  will not speak to you and they do not really appreciate the tourists. but it is
  enough to dig a little to know that they are formable and admirable people following
  their course. the food is amazing you can taste the pierogi (small stuffed ravioli)
  or specialitee the donut with rose jam sitting on the market square in front of
  this great basilica with warm colors and the sound of the trumpet, all around a
  broom brooms incessant caleches pulled by horses more beautiful than each other.
  you will be able to drink a coffee spiced with cinnamon on the numerous terrace
  presents so agreable lorque the sun comes to carresser the face. and yes, one month
  in Poland I only had good weather in autumn. the country is beautiful the country
  is rich the culture very rewarding. one of the most beautiful discoveries of my
  many trips.
