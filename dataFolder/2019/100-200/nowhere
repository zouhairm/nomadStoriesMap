Text: "Once I & my group members went to Shillong, India for our theatrical play.\
  \ It is also known as \" Abode of the Clouds \" and \" Scotland of the East \".\
  \ I have never been gone to such places before. it was very cold there & natural\
  \ water streams & uphills everywhere. We also went to famous Dawaki river which\
  \ flows between Bangladesh to India. It has crystal clear waters and we experience\
  \ a heavenly scenario. We also went to see living root bridges of trees which challenges\
  \ today's engineering. All was for once and for first & last in life time. So we\
  \ enjoyed a lot. We made new friends and learn different culture with some new words\
  \ of their regional Khasi language.\n I have never been before out of India & I\
  \ wish my dream will come true one day as a traveller."
