Text: Oneday, I go to the Sebatik Island. Sebatik Island is an island with two countries,
  namely Indonesia and Malaysia. My journey started from Jakarta towards the City
  of Tarakan in North Kalimantan. Then I went to Sebatik Island using a boat from
  Malundung Port in Tarakan City. The journey reaches 12 hours. When I arrived on
  Sebatik Island, I lived in Lourdes Village. The name is similar to a village in
  the French city of the same name. Sebatik Island has two currency transactions,
  namely Indonesian Rupiah and Ringgit from Malaysia. Sebatik Island is a remote lagoon
  region even though it is close to Malaysia. Education on Sebatik Island is very
  far from feasible. Children still lack education. They need teaching staff to be
  able to help children in the interior of Sebatik Island. There are overgrown with
  oil palm trees but Sebatik is far behind Malaysia.
