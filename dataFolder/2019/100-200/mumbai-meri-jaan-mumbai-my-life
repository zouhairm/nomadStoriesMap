Text: 'A city that never sleeps. A city that has plenty of diversities like 1000 plus
  gods and godesses, 100 plus religions and different believes, 50 plus different
  languages spoken, 25 plus regional newapapers and magazines, rural to urban and
  internation clothings and dressed up men and women. This is a city which is really
  unpredictable in all terms like religion, political, unions, etc. This is the city
  where you will find cuisines of all over the world... you name it and its there..
  mughlai, chinese, thai, continental, japanese, italian, and much more part of local
  indian dishes. The famous fast food is vada pav which is a commonly served food
  across the city and internationally named as indian burger.

  more to mumbai still continues.....'
