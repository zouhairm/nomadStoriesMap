Text: 'As i went to visit my mentor and a teacher in Palakkad to convey my regards
  on her birthday. i saw my soulmate.


  in an institution where my teacher worked. i came to see an angel. she was there
  infront of me, i swim in her eyes as her eyes looks alike as a fish. her energetic
  personality to convert bad to angel. was all it takes to fall in love. as the time
  passed an hour, yet nothing changed.


  she went on, her voice was like waves in the sea. active downs amd ups, yet charming.
  i looked in her eyes and asked her mobile number, then the journey started.


  the mischievous and the humanities passed all along with each other. we loved, we
  cared, we laughed, we cried all along journey. well! things will never be the same,
  anyway right?


  the family members enters in to the conversation as we now know, its little bit
  deep for her to leave her family for me. but, she promised to stay as a friend.
  all along in my life. yet i cry all night. till i die.'
