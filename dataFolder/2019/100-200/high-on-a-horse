Text: "My travel story was themed around horse riding, traveling to the Free State\
  \ Province of South Africa and making a connection with the local Basotho people.\
  \ The result was an escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life into nature\
  \ and learnings about my own culture. \n\nI was travelling from Cape Town to the\
  \ well known Golden Gate Highlands National Park. Upon arrival, I checked into the\
  \ hotel and met up with the photographer for a photoshoot - at the hotel, at the\
  \ horse riding school for an outride and on a leisurely drive up a hill. These were\
  \ the events of the first day of my travel assignment, in connecting with nature\
  \ and the horse. \n\nOn the second day, I had the opportunity to connect with the\
  \ local people. I was taken for a tour in an indigenous village of the Basotho people.\
  \ I gained more insight about my heritage as a half Pedi South African, also known\
  \ as the Northern Sotho people of the country.\n\nAfter this excursion, I made my\
  \ way back to Cape Town. My story was published in Wild Card magazine in 2017, I\
  \ also featured on the cover on a horse."
