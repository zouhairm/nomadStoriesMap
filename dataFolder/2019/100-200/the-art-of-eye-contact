Text: "Arriving to USA two years ago, in January to be part of an intensive english\
  \ class for improve my vocabulary and pronunciation, I met a german guy and it was\
  \ necessary just an eye contact to know we will like each other. I\u2019ve never\
  \ thought stay with someone on a trip because it\u2019s too hard and sad for me\
  \ say goodbye and don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m going to ser that person again.\
  \ But fortunately sincee that moment we\u2019ve been in touch, talking by calls\
  \ and social media like instagram, whatsapp, etc all these two years and now he\
  \ is coming in August to my country (Argentina) for meet one more time. We will\
  \ visit some turistics  places and probably I\u2019ll go to Germany next year. It\u2019\
  s a typical but not less awesome love story through the distance."
