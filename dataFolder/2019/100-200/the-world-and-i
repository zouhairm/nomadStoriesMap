Text: "Here I am in a foreign country, a country everybody would love to visit because\
  \ of its famous landmarks such as the Eiffel Towel and Louvre Museum to name a few.\
  \ \n\nYes it has been my dream to visit France and explore such beautiful and historical\
  \ landmarks. But what I am excited to know about France is its people. People whom\
  \ I\u2019d like to meet and get to know more , more about them, their culture and\
  \ their food! I believe language is not going to be a hindrance in exploring this\
  \ place! We will communite through food, people and culture! \n\nAs a Filipino,\
  \ to be in a country like France would be an amazing experience! \n\nSo let\u2019\
  s go and explore France with me, fellow Asians!"
