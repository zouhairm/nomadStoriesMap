Text: From Vasco da Gama to cristiano Ronaldo Portugal has been the land of hereos
  and daring people.But it's not only about the people but also about the places,be
  it Madeira be it Lisbon be it Porto beauty beholds within every city with a vast
  history to be learnt about every place.its now my time to get into the streets of
  Portugal and find out what people don't know about it from crazy places to eat to
  peaceful places to relax let's backpack and explore this beautiful country and make
  sure we find out places which a tourist doesn't go but a Traveller will.
