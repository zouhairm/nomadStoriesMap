Text: "In May,2012 \n\nThis is my first step in seeing an outside country. No plan\
  \ no friend  accompanied me for this story when i called my new experience to see\
  \ the world. on the plane before taking off I made a status on my social media \"\
  Bye-Bye Indonesia\" with a little sense of pride in posting it.I've never been this\
  \ brave , in my mind I asked what I would do when I arrived  but with the knowledge\
  \ I read on  google and I read and read again blogs of people who have been to Singapore\
  \ , so i hope i can feel enjoy for this journey.\n\n3 hours more I was in the plane\
  \ to arrive in Singapore from my hometown of Makassar, Indonesia, I was immediately\
  \ amazed by the airport called Changi Airport.With sincere intention to see the\
  \ world  I started my journey that day alone by my self."
