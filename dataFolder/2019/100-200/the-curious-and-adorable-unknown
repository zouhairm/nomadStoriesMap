Text: "Most of girls, nowadays, like shoes, purses and make up. I'm different, I'd\
  \ change all of this, for knowing the whole world.\nThe thing is: I never had enough\
  \ money to do all the traveling I wish I could. But that's all right. When we want\
  \ something we must find a way, right?!\nFor me it never mattered. The nearby city...\
  \ Or a closer state. Since I remember I love to discover, to explore, to know. Alone\
  \ or accompanied.\nBut, then, the dreams started to get bigger and bigger. I wanted\
  \ to know different people, different flavors, languages, cultures. Diversity.\n\
  It was then that, in 2016, I got all my coins and decided to go to Mexico to do\
  \ a volunteer work. And you know what? It was, scared, because I was absolutely\
  \ alone. It was also hard, none of my family never supported my dream, but, above\
  \ all, it was transformative, in other words: my best choice.\nWhen I came back\
  \ home I already knew I'll never be the same. \nThe world is so big. And beautiful.\
  \ And has so much to teach...\nI don't want to stop this curious and adorable path\
  \ to unknown."
