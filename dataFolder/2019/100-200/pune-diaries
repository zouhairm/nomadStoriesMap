Text: When i first reached there i didn't know that i will be able to nake connection
  but yeah when i was leaving this there are lot of people who were crying who doesnt
  even know my real identity.they just know i am normal who is coming from another
  city to explore thus city. I won't be to express this beautiful experience of mine
  in 700 words but i'll try.so,it was a new life for me where i didnot know anyone
  and i was alone there.and having a cultural and language differences i was a bit
  scared but when i start talking to random people and asking them for a coffee and
  we went into a great conversation.by that time we started making a connection.i
  met some people who were 70 someof them were above 40 and yeah finally someof them
  were above my age.noone knew my age and they still don't .
