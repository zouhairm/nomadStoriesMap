Text: "February 2016: I proposed to who I thought was my true love and best friend.\
  \ She said yes and at that moment I was the luckiest guy ever. \n\nI always wanted\
  \ to make her feel as if she was the only girl in the whole world. My Victoria Beckham\
  \ or Gauri Khan. \n\nFebruary 2019: I have been dumped by my best friend. Having\
  \ had enough of sleepless nights I sat in Cherapunjee on my first ever solo trip\
  \ fearing the unknown. \n\nThen something happened...\n\nI hitchhiked, got kicked\
  \ off a homestay, got lost, roamed around the the streets in search for a place,\
  \ fell over, got bruised, got up, sang, jumped into a waterfall, felt the chill\
  \ of said water, scored the best free weed of my life, made friends with amazing\
  \ people, ate strange food, got invited to their homes, bought a hitchhiker food,\
  \ felt freedom, felt so happy. \n\nFrom the worst of times to the best. I had never\
  \ felt like this. \n\nI have found my true love for now, it is traveling. Getting\
  \ lost in the unknown."
