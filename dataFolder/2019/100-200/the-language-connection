Text: Cree is an Indigenous language within Canada that more and more people are learning
  about. However to the world outside of Canada, it is a language that most may have
  not even heard of. Through this trip, teaching the basics of the language will be
  the focus as I travel to parts of Portugal and make the connection of teaching my
  Indigenous language to different people. In return I simply ask that they also teach
  me words from their native tongue. Through this process an exhchange of knowledge
  and culture will be met, and more people to the outside world can learn the rich
  and re-emerging history of the Cree Language.
