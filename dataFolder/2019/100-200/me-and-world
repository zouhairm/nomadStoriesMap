Text: 'Me and World


  World is a largest comunity. All are stay in world we can call it comunity. Every
  part of our have a responsibility about how to make the world better. Travel world
  not always means that we can go somewhere. But actually when i rich i will do that.
  I can around the world just surfing with my cheap handphone. I can seen everything
  i want. Some informations will save in my mind and i will do that when i have better
  chance than now. I can    not run because many peoples borrowed my shoses and foot
  without permission. And my heart felt disappointed.'
