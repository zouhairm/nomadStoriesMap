Text: 'As a child growing up in Trinidad I always heard that my grandmother left Madeira
  as a young child with her family and sailed to Trinidad in the 1890s in search of
  a better life.

  I did some on line research and found a civil registry site for Madeira. I made
  contact with the supervisor and was able to get a lot of information about my grandmother
  who left Madeira with her parents and siblings in September of 1894, when she was
  5 years old!

  In May of 2018 my wife and I made a trip to Madeira to get more information on my
  grandmother and her family.  My story is about this trip and the family connections
  We discovered on this trip.'
