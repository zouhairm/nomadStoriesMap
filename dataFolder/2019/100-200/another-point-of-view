  \ to blessed for each oportunity because that makes me see life different, makes\
  \ me see the unexpected beauty of every picture, every landscape, every person that\
  \ i have the chance to known, that make me feel so grateful, because thanks of that\
  \ i see life different and all i want is share, share it with every person i know,\
  \ share my words and my moments. I don\u2019t wanna stop, i\u2019m young and i feel\
  \ like i\u2019m unstoppable thanks to this trip.\n\nThis journey also make me discover\
