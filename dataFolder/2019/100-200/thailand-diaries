Text: 'I went to Thailand on Christmas was there for a week.  The hospitality is just
  awesome, people don''t get agitated and are always smiling. The thing which touched
  me is that the whole country is smiling where ever you go be it the market place,
  beaches, islands, . From the poor to the rich all are happy and smiling.they believe
  in doing everything on time and are very dedicated towards it.

  One more thing is that , if they commit you something they fulfill it.

  Food is awesome in Thailand and that took at a very reasonable cost.tge places visited
  by me was Bangkok, Pattaya, ko larn, Koh phangan.'
