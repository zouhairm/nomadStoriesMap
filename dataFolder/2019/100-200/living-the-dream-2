Text: "Hi team , I have 9 years experience of International market in customer support\
  \ and tech support  but my passion and dream was traveller and owner of cafe since\
  \ my school but fate brought me in job as my father passed away but each single\
  \ day my dream is alive in my mind to fulfill it.  Recently after great 9 years\
  \ I quit the job to live in my dream and passion and opened Homestay for travellers\
  \ as I love travelling . In 2018 ,it was like an achievement to me and thanks to\
  \ google that they counted my efforts of travelling and gave the badge of level\
  \ 6 as travel guide . I travelled 28 places ,4 cities and 1 country but over all\
  \ 13,711 KM's which is 34 % of the world. Tourist see the place but travel enjoy\
  \ and feel the place . Travellers see the actual beauty of the city, if anybody\
  \ wants to know the actual city ask traveller not the tour guide . \n\nFind me on\
