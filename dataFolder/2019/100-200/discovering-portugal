Text: 'Discovering Portugal is about seeing the sights, meeting the people, understanding
  the culture, experiencing the food, and perhaps learning the language. A country
  is more than just one of these things, it is all of them combined that makes a country
  what it is. As a travel writer, that''s what it is all about, taking an adventure
  to discover something completely different than what you already know or have already
  experienced.


  Learning about others and how they live, especially in a place different from yours,
  is an experience unlike any other and those that can''t or have not been able to,
  deserve to also share in the experience even if it is through word and pictures.
  You can paint with words and a picture can tell the words.'
