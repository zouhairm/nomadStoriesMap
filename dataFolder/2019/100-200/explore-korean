Text: "I want to explore South Korea because I want to see beautiful places that I\u2019\
  ve seen on the Korean Drama on TV. I want to studying about Korean\u2019s language,\
  \ Korean\u2019s culture and daily activities on there. I want to try Korean food\
  \ and beverages (Kimchi, Ramyeon, Bulgogi, etc). I want to visit Nami island, Namsan\
  \ Tower, Myeong-dong, Buckhon Hanok Village, Insa-dong, Everland, Lotte World, Etc.\
  \ That\u2019s all I want, all I dreamed and I hope it will come true. And because\
  \ I love the Korean music, I like Blackpink, BTS, EXO, I love all things that Korean\
  \ offers to me. So I hope that I can visit that country. And be the unforgettable\
  \ story and moments in my life."
