Text: "Expressing the words as an experience with the place that I visited many times\
  \ in my life. The experience wasn't regarding the people only, there also I got\
  \ a wonderful feeling of belonging with the nature and it's day to day lives.\n\n\
  \      The story of the day we started from our home bicycle to the place that were\
  \ far away from my home to mostly about 50 to 60 kilometers. It was very fantastic\
  \ to go by bicycle. We really enjoyed the day with the wonderful nature and the\
  \ regarding the people belongs to there. It was Un similar from the crowd of the\
  \ city, like their living styles their passion and their way of behaving and living\
  \ styles, etc. I was really found something about the culture that are approximately\
  \ dependent upon the nature and it becomes like moving from a crowd where the world\
  \ is something different from that. Fishing, farming, poultry are the livelihoods\
  \ of the people. It was such a pleasure to see their styles of operating with that.\
  \ It was very nice to understand about their day to day lives."
