Text: 'I''m a scholar working on a 10 volume travelogue of an Ottoman traveller, Evliya
  Celebi''s Seyahatname (The Book of Travels) from 17th century. Evliya has travelled
  through an enormous geography from Austria in west, Sibiria in north, Russia in
  east and North Africa in south as well as Balkans, and the whole Anatolia at that
  time, which inspires me tremendously. What effected me mostly in his travel writing
  was that being an Ottoman and Muslim he caressed the non-Muslim cultures with an
  ultimate curiosity and wonder.

  I''ve been in Lisbon for a month before for a summer school and this city has a
  unique place for me. It was a perfect combination for me in the sense of belonging
  to both Western world and also its Muslim tissue, both European and Muslim Mediterranean.

  I''d like to focus on this hybridity in my story.'
