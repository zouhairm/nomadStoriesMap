Text: 'Life is full of good surprises. I could realize one of my dreams traveling
  to Alaska to see the Northern Lights, it was a magical moment that took tears out
  my eyes, I will never forget the feeling of that day. Other opportunities came and
  I could see even stronger northern lights but that first one was special. I experienced
  the magic of a solar storm hitting the Earth and its beautiful color in the sky.
  It was magic!

  After that I was sure that I would seek the frozen lights and here I am leaving
  in Northern Sweden.

  That trip was full of special things. Doing a couch surf in Fairbanks I was invited
  to join a lovely friend''s gathering for Easter, they said: "This is a special time
  it should be hard to be alone in another city, another country". Indeed travel alone
  sometimes can be hard, you can feel lonely but I felt home that day sharing a delicious
  lunch with very kind people that opened their home for a traveler and shared more
  than a meal and for sure this will be one of my unforgettable memories of Alaska.'
