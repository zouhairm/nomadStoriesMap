Text: "The eccentric Indian trail \U0001F1EE\U0001F1F3 \n\nDarjeeling the queen of\
  \ hills\nAnd the range that follows \nDriving all the way\nOff-city buzz \nin a\
  \ stranger\u2019s stay,\nunplanned\nA calm concept longing peace\nlazily opportunistic\
  \ \nOxygenated by the day.\nStar struck by night, \nand a foggy view of the tiny\
  \ lit mountains,\nWith a blend of classy music\nand shots of caffeine with this\
  \ crazy bunch of pals\nTaking feels of adulting amongst the mountains.\nsurely aesthetic\
  \ \nUnforgettable it was \nFor its karizmatic view\nThe snow capped Kunchunjunga\n\
  And the very first rays that striked it\u2019s peak\nInundating \nWith the crystal\
  \ white polished piece of  heaven\nThe most honest reflections of my feelings \n\
  made my heart feel full again!"
