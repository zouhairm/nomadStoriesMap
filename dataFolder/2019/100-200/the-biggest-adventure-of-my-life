Text: 'When I came to Australia, I had never left my country of origin, Brazil.

  I left friends, family, work, everything back, to live my dream of discovering new
  cultures, people, places and changing my vision of the world and my life.

  Here I learned that humility is one of the most important things, because we do
  everything to survive. I have visited incredible places that will be engraved in
  my memory forever and people who have helped me a lot and that I will carry forever
  in my heart.

  Australia has completely changed me. Today I am a much stronger person, with goals
  and going after what he wants.

  The word that sums up this journey and gratitude.'
