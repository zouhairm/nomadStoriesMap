Text: I headed to Kasol for my first ever solo trip. Excited, confused, thrilled and
  curious I boarded the Volvo from Delhi's kashmiri gate to bhuntar, it was an overnight
  journey so I dozzed off as soon as I got on my seat not expecting what I'll witness
  after waking up. On reaching bhuntar I was told to board a local business to Kasol
  but there was no sign of any bus and fortunately I met with this beautiful couple
  who came from Israel, seeking help from the locals as one of them got sick so out
  of courtsey I came forward to assist them for medical help and other things, after
  boarding the bus to Kasol we had a brief introduction and we found out that inspite
  of being from another country we have similar interests and likings thus we decided
  to stay in the same guest house and explore the place together and make some beautiful
  memories. It has been 2 years but we are still connected on social media and we
  are planning to go for our next adventure to connect and know more cultures and
  souls across the globe and to take another leap into the unknown.
