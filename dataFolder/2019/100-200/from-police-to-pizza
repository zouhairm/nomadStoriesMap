Text: "\u201CYou both go with me to the police office, I won\u2019t give you back\
  \ your passport\u201D that was how the train officer was telling us that we were\
  \ in troubles, the reason: after but the railPass we didn\u2019t mark it when we\
  \ used it, actually we bought the ticket in France and we didn\u2019t understand\
  \ a word the French guy said to us. After 2 stops and no police office actually\
  \ open, the train officer started talking to us in a better way, he started explaining\
  \ how the train works and he invited us to meet the train driver and after a nice\
  \ talk his mad eyes started to look more friendly, he haves is back our passport\
  \ and as we said we didn\u2019t have money to pay any kind of penalty fee he envites\
  \ us to take lunch! Best pizza ever! What did we learn? Doesn\u2019t matter how\
  \ bad a situation looks like you can always fix it with nice talk and pizza!"
