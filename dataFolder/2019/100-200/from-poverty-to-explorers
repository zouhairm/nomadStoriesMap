Text: "I am an aspiring historian currently working towards a history major. In one\
  \ of these classes I learned about Henrey the navigator and how Portugal went to\
  \ a poverished country to one of explorers. I learned that they found a route to\
  \ Asia by boat that didn\u2019t require going through the Ottoman Empire which disliked\
  \ them based on their religious differences. They later then went on to colonize\
  \ the new world, and started the age of discovery. I would like to exmain how this\
  \ discovery influenced them today. I would to find out if they are still aspiring\
  \ travelers and adventours and how their previous history of exploring has impacted\
  \ them now. I would like to see if there is influence of other countries where they\
  \ are, by seeing if some of what these merchants and lords that traveled brought\
  \ something back that left a lasting impact. I want to be able to write about the\
  \ history of exploring in Portugal and how they were the ones who started the age\
  \ of exploration and people such as Christopher columbus and Cortez merely followed\
  \ in their foot steps."
