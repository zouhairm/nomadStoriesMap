Text: "I was 18 years old, when i went to travelled alone without accompanied by my\
  \ parents. I go to Kuching, Malaysia \nI was very nervous when i waited at airport,\
  \ so i got lost \U0001F602. After that i went to my friend's house and slept there,\
  \ i slept with 5 people. On my first day i go to boulevard met my boy friend and\
  \ we eat together. Then, i go to kuching waterfront, main bazaar, I and others.\
  \ \nWhat i like the most is i can try something new. Such as: food, place, people,\
  \ and others. \nIf i can win this i will grateful for it. And also i can learn something\
  \ new in this country."
