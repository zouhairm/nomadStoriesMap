Text: "At first I thought it would be difficult to immerge and understand your culture.\
  \ But then I felt more confortable with you than I was back in my hometown.\nI grew\
  \ up with principals and values that i couldn\u2019t find in my own society. But\
  \ I found it when I met you. \nBeijing, you have been a delight to me. I encountered\
  \ so many great people who would just appreciate the fact that I would try to speak\
  \ Chinese. Beijing, you helped me when I was lost, and you gave me faith in humanity\
  \ again. \nTho I know so many people dislike you, are afraid of you, but it\u2019\
  s because you are great! And you did great! \nBeijing, I miss you, I miss your people,\
  \ your food, your architecture, your possibilities to success, I miss the all of\
  \ you. \nYou have been so great to me and to so many others who had the chance to\
  \ meet you.\nAnd one day, I hope, I will see you again."
