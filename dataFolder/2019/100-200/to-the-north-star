Text: No matter what time of the year, no matter which city, the one thing  that has
  always constantly been next to the ever-changing moon is you. You always make me
  feel that one drop of light is enough for us to make it through the dark night sky.
  All that the three wise men needed was you as their anchor point to guide them to
  the lord. When my feet were in river and looked up from the banks I could see you.
  When I was at the highest altitude you seem a little closer and that's when I felt
  the closest to home. And even when the sky was quite and millions of star were making
  the night glitter, you stood the tallest. No matter which part of the world, country
  or city my name soul is, I will always find my roots up in the sky with you. You
  will always be the local connection I require to fit in this estranged world.
