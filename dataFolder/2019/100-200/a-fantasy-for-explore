Text: 'For a long time, I thought I knew the beautiful Colombia. I really believe
  that Colombia was a simple country, nothing impressive. But I was wrong, I needed
  an unexpected trip to one of its beautiful cities.


  Colombia is a country full of history, culture and passion. A country full of fantasies,
  stories and experiences that not everyone can get to know.


  I have lived so long in Colombia, that I thought that I could not have a much more
  interesting experience than I had already lived. I thought I knew everything and
  that is why I was much more interested in visiting and traveling to other countries.
  But it is impossible to know your country completely, even though you have lived
  your whole life there.


  Colombia is full of unexplored places that are natural beauty, something exotic
  and unique that your eyes could see.'
