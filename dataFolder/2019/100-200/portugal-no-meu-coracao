Text: "I traveled several times to Portugal and it is the deepest love that I feel\
  \ for this country, for its traditions, its way of being so mediterranean and atlantic\
  \ at the same time, so cosmopolitan and so traditional.\nIt is a country of contrasts,\
  \ a country that falls in love with those words that sound like fado, a fisherwomans,\
  \ a local underground in the \u201CRua rosa\u201D of Lisbon.\nMy trip would try\
  \ to show the traditions of the way of life from the north Portugal to the more\
  \ cosmopolitan Portugal until the light of the southern beaches.\nFirst start art\
  \ Oporto and countries of Portugal north, its gastronomy, its buildings that have\
  \ stories behind.\nWe will go down to Lisbon, Estoril and Cascais where we enter\
  \ ay the modern Portugal, in an idyllic capital with history and modern, avant-garde.\n\
  We will discover the artistic movements of the city, the best restaurants and small\
  \ shops of all time.\nLater we will go down to the south, beach to beach, port to\
  \ port, seeing how the sailors bring seafood and listening to their stories, without\
  \ leaving aside the emerging and current surfer portugal.\nRediscover Portugal and\
  \ teach it to the world.\nPortugal, big unknown of Southampton Europe."
