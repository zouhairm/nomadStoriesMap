Text: Make the world your home, for it's really beautiful. I do not see it just for
  the TV screen or your cell phone. Live, conquer, venture out and you will be much
  happier.When I was 16 years old I made my first international trip to New Zealand,
  I was a shy teenager, I had never traveled to any place, I had never seen the sea
  or even stayed away from my parents, but I knew that to win that one scholarship
  to study in another country would change my life and I was right. The New Zealand
  showed me that being alone in an unknown country, living with unknown people and
  having as a medium of communication a language that I did not master would have
  its advantages, besides living in the skin a beautiful and empressing culture. From
  this trip I realized that to live truly requires a certain level of courage and
  strength, I learned that it's necessary to win the world, to conquer it only to
  know it for real.
