Text: "I started to travel to the unknown places to discover the different lifestyle,\
  \ culture like languages, food and history of the places also to exchange with locals\
  \ and especially meet the wanderlust from all over the world I have just started\
  \ on travel for few days into each country around Europe first as I don\u2019t have\
  \ a work and so no income or salary ! I learned Portuguese and keep practising I\
  \ studied in the univ of languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese) Portugal was\
  \ on my to do list but haven\u2019t done it yet would be amazing to discover this\
  \ place and do an mutual culture exchange \nI am a hard hearing person and found\
