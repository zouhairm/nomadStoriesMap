Text: "Going day-by- day with the rotunies in life is the pattern of habits and stable.\
  \ It becomes so going on that looking into other lives would allow ourself to be\
  \ center focus when there\u2019s a whole world with people to connect. On the other\
  \ hand, visiting a beach water island with nice trees would be ideal. Jamaica, located\
  \ close to Haiti and Cuba but had a  culture  Within it self. Being  colonized by\
  \ the British allowed forms of their primary language and government structures.\
  \  Jamaica had their own food, games, celebration and religion. Jamaica a flag with\
  \ yellow, green and black. An island filled with people who has been through the\
  \ poverty, riches, & development."
