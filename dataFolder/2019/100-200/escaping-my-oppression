Text: "My travel story will be about a Honduran young boy who is tired of the oppression\
  \ and discrimination of his town. He had never experienced what is like to live\
  \ outside his box, that\u2019s why he decided to explore Portugal ( since he heard\
  \ that Portugal is a more liberal and open place). During his trip, the young boy\
  \ will go through a process of reflection and self exploration. Once outside hiscountry\
  \ where people used to judge him and make him feel less for being \u2018gay\u2019\
  , he will have to face the reality of his life. Discovering a new place and experiencing\
  \ a new culture will encourage this young boy to not feel as an outsider anymore.\
  \ His most hidden secret will finally be released and a new life will come to him.\
  \ Enrique will be release and will finally realize that he should not be afraid\
  \ to be who he is."
