Text: "IT WAS MIND BLOWING EXPERIENCE FOR ME WHEN I LANDED IN UNITED ARAB EMIRATES\
  \ ,AND IT WAS COMPLETELY WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR ME,I NEVER SAW IN MY LIFE THIS KIND\
  \ OF ENVIRONMENT WHERE MORE THAN PEOPLE FROM MORE THEN 140 COUNTRIES WERE WORKING\
  \ AND LIVING WITH COMPLETE RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER AND WITH HARMONY.\n\nWHERE I OBSERVED\
  \ RESPECT FOR EVERY ONE IT DOES NOT MATTER WHICH COUNTRY HE BELONG AND WHICH RELIGION\
  \ HE FALLOWS,THERE WERE NO DISCRIMINATION DUE TO COLOR ,SKIN OR COST.IN OTHER WORDS\
  \ I WILL SAY UAE IS SMALL WORLD WHERE WE CAN FIND ALMOST EVERY NATION PEOPLE LIVING\
  \ WITH FULL FREEDOM.\n\nAND I NOTICED EVERY ONE IS RESPECT THE LAW,AND ITS MAKE\
  \ UAE IS GREAT PLACE TO LIVE.EVERY ONE IS FEELING FULL SECURITY AND FREEDOM AND\
  \ NO ONE CAN HARM ANY ONE.\n\nIT WAS COMPLETE SHOCK FOR FOR ME TO SEE A SUCH A SOCIETY\
  \ OR COUNTRY AND I FEEL GREAT TO BE  A PART OF THAT KIND OF SOCIETY . \n\nITS MY\
  \ DREAM TO SEE EVERY PLACE OF EARTH LIKE UAE WHERE ,THERE IS NO FEAR OR JUSTICE\
