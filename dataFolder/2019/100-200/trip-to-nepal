Text: 'it all started with the plan of long drive. we passed through jungles, drove
  through highways and there it was indo nepal border.

  our network was about to blow we needed new sim cards. turns out it was 30 mins
  work. one went for sim other went for passes. and then the journey begins. i had
  no idea how nepal would be. i always thought of it to be semi developing country.
  when we traveled through hills i realize people of this country is actually developed
  in a way they travel vertically on the hills by foot they have homes all over hills
  with no way to travel and nothing to park. they have developed sence of humanity
  and since are fit in numerous way. soon we reached pokhra city between mountains.
  If you are looking for something pretty sure you are in the right place. trekking
  in the mountains to boating in the lake, paragliding in air to hopping through the
  bar. it was more than we imagined when we decided to come here. this long drive
  turned out to be better than anticipated.'
