Text: I was travelling to Uttarakhand masoori. It was quite late when we reach there
  was a lot of stuff happen in my life. I was just there to relax as travel is the
  best way to change your mood.  We all reach there as the plan we all go to hotel
  and then started roming here n there in masoori.  After some time I started going
  up from the small path, so after a little walk i saw down n saw the beautiful clouds
  . I feel like I was above the cloud n at that point I realized all my emotions and
  started loving my self.. When I was see down all I saw clouds light the beauty of
  cloud there emotions how the are always there with us but don't let any one felt
  there existence .we can only feel them and that feeling is an emotion only a traveler
  can understand..
