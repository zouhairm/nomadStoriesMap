Text: As the plane crosses the Atlantic Ocean my head runs thoughts of how it could
  be, landing in the old world ever felt so close. A list of what to do was made comprised
  with a in depth research of places to go and see in Portugal. And I catch waves,
  after 3 years residing in Los Angeles, California, I have dove into the surfing
  culture lifestyle that composes the Southern Californian air. And have evolved to
  be an acceptable surfer on the breaks I frequently paddled out to. Food is a subject
  I often hear people mentioning after a Portuguese pilgrimage, about its astounishing
  seafood dishes and the warm welcoming from the natives. How many shoes should take?
