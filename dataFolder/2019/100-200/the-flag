Text: "That should be the 25th day of the trip. And I was relaxing, having a beer\
  \ after another trekking to Everest Base Camp. It was Irish Pub with people from\
  \ all over the world, ready to go to the summit or to celebrate victory of the safe\
  \ return. Even with that sonorous confusion of languages, I recognized the one from\
  \ my country. The words c\xE2mera out from a boy, who was fiddling with a Brazilian\
  \ flag hunged near from me. I introduced myself and saw that he was signing the\
  \ flag. He asked me if I had already signed. I said no. When I approached with the\
  \ pen, the big surprise, my name was already there, with the year I had been there\
  \ the first time: 2014. I added the new year and photographed the flag. If wasnt\
  \   for the boy, I would never live this story. Returnig to the return to beer,\
  \ a thought comes to mind: Will I be able to put another year on that flag in the\
  \ future? Hope so."
