Text: It is a travel story of myself, aiming to travel around the city, meeting new
  people, exploring places at my own time, interracting with locals and basically
  getting to know the whole city itself. It is an unforgettable experience that will
  be written down in my own simplest form. From day to day of where I would go to,
  people watch with a cup of coffee, interracting with the sales person striking up
  a small conversation. Understanding each and everyone, the culture of the city.
  Exploring different parts of the city with no time limits, going to new different
  places, best without any directions, Google Maps. I feel that the best thing about
  exploring is that you do not expect what you will see and come to you and that will
  be a total unforgettable experience one would have. My words would describe my feelings,
  what has happened during the journey travel, who I have met and etc. My story will
  be like a personal travel diary that i would keep and always look back in the future
  to recap the memories.
