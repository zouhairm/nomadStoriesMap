Text: "I was traveling through Cartagena, rosario islands, baru and one day joking\
  \ with my brother I found a girl, a girl different to everything I ever saw, she\
  \ was beautiful but I thought she was too much for me... soy I didn\u2019t intended\
  \ to talk her.... but suddenly in my tinder app a girl matched... it was her asking\
  \ me if I was the boy of the end of the table.... so I saw the photo and it was\
  \ her... I was absolutely euphoric and as fast as I could went to talk with her...\
  \ we had such fun that from that day we never stoped talking and now I\u2019m visiting\
  \ her again... she will show me the hole country and probably she will became my\
  \ girlfriend after that... this is a true love story that I thought it was only\
  \ for fairy tales... thanks and sorry for my writing mistakes!!"
