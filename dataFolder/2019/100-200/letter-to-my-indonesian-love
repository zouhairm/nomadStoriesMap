Text: "Dear Indonesian love... Im writing this with watery eyes. You have no idea\
  \ on how good you have been to my soul, restorting my faith in humanity, in life\
  \ and of course... In magic. Since I met you 7 months ago in Europe, I knew you\
  \ had something different, something unique. I'm glad I was able to enjoy your company\
  \ and quality time. At first I told you that Indonesia was like a bonus track from\
  \ my trip, but my dear... You made it the highlight, showing me the best places\
  \ like Bromo... Taken from a mpvie, from fairytales, with Mountains so high that\
  \ could reach heaven, so green that I could breath the purest air ever, so beautiful\
  \ that it was hard to believe that I was awake. The best food, that awesome and\
  \ spicy Padang, eating it under the cascades with our hand, going back to basics,\
  \ only living the momment, appreciating life, love, us. \nI'm very grateful that\
  \ life set you in my way. I definitely wasn't expecting to find this kind, pure\
  \ love in my trip. Maybe even in my life... But the place made it incredible and\
  \ you... Made it perfect. \n\nAlways yours,\n\nMe."
