Text: "\u2018Cinta\u2019 is a word in Malay that means \u2018love\u2019. I am a PTSD\
  \ sufferer, so recovering for a breakup is like being shot by a gun albeit multiple\
  \ times. It was terrible for me to wake up and get out of bed, let alone looking\
  \ for \u2018cinta\u2019. I have the whole gamut of anxiety and early schizophrenia\
  \ diagnosis during that time and recovery was not easy. I made the decision to visit\
  \ Iceland, the land of ice and fire. When I was there, surprisingly, coming from\
  \ a tropical country, it\u2019s not the cold that bothers me the most. It was the\
  \ fact that I had very very minimal anxiety attacks and was very happy. It\u2019\
  s like I was granted a new life and new outlook towards my life. And that\u2019\
  s when I also discover my new \u2018cinta\u2019; Brazilian Jiujitsu."
