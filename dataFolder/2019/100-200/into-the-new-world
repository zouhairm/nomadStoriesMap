Text: I've travel only within my country and i love going to other region and find
  some historical houses, places, churches because they tell on my eyes the story
  of how filipinos suffer under the colony of Spaniards. I remember when me and my
  friends go on a trip in ifugao we saw ethnic groups wearing their "katutubong kasuotan"
  and dancing their ritual dance then we ask if we can join them and they  replied
  yes with a bright smile, that's what i like when I'm travelling, i feel like im
  being one of them. Travelling is my reason too to find myself, what is god plan
  me to do here in the world, you know my feeling when im leaving in that place, when
  the travelling and exploring is over, just so many thoughts popping in my mind like
  the world is so big and I've only seen different place in my country, i wander what's
  with in other country ? What's with in other world?
