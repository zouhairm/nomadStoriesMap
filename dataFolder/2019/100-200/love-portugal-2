Text: Portugal is the most beautiful place and country in the world and it has this
  most amazing town name our Lady of Fatima and I want to see this place and be filled
  with the love and comfort of the people there in Portugal. There are so many different
  ways we can enjoy ourselves and have fun with our family and friends who are far
  away from us. The things I ever wanted to say is the blessings of the Lord and our
  Mother Mary is till there among us. I want to see all the places I have not heard
  of my whole life and I am willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that we have
  all we need to know about our Lady and also to pray for others as well as our family
  and friends.
