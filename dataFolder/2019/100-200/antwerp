Text: "I docked at the port of Antwerp ready to see the place where Princes came to\
  \ give their brides diamonds.What a  shock I found architecture of unwashed old\
  \ buildings with graphite walls bumping into each other. Small narrow streets with\
  \ a Saturday market catering to middle-aged women who bought chocolate which was\
  \ pure. Knits for the not so reliable weather.My dreams shattered I expected the\
  \ elegance of Paris and found the street market of a town with very little sight\
  \ of the diamond quarters, why did I pick Belgium.Was it returning to the African\
  \ Belgium Congo of my first eight years as the doctor \u2018s daughter or was it\
  \ pure romance of rubies and sapphires. Neither an exploration that made me face\
  \ the reality of ordinary life going on in a very ordinary town.Thus I discovered\
  \ seeing is believing."
