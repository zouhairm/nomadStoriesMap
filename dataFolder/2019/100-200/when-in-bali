Text: "The definition of happiness is the state of being happy. I happened to find\
  \ it tricky once state can mean a moment or a lifetime. During my life, I have always\
  \ heard that I was a happy and joyful person. However, as I was growing up, new\
  \ experiences were bringing me the concept of volatile happiness. \nDuring my travels,\
  \ I thought I would find interesting people, hear amazing stories, feel the calm\
  \ of being in a desert beach, get in contact with strong political monuments, feel\
  \ the vibrancy of global cities, however, I never thought I would feel what I felt\
  \ when exploring Bali. \nBali brought me joy and kindness. It took me by the hand\
  \ and gently showed me how to connect with myself and the world around me. In Bali,\
  \ I understood that life can be simple, humble and extremely sweet. I learned that\
  \ there is beauty everything. In Bali, I understood that the state of happiness\
  \ can be a lifetime."
