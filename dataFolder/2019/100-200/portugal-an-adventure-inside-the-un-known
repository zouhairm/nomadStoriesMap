Text: 'I''m African, born in Mozambique. What I know about portugal is that it was
  a country that colonized my country, but throughout my growth, I have learned little
  about this nation rich in cultural values, a nation in permanent construction without
  departing from its identity. It fascinates me to look at this country, mainly because
  it represents in a peculiar way to maintain its identity traditions, at the same
  time that it embarks towards the modernization of the various areas of social life,
  infrastructures, etc., or was not in Europe.


  Traveling to this nation would be honorable to me, not only because of historical
  issues previously mentioned, but also because it would sharpen my investigative
  vein.


  The proposal of the story that I intend to write is without a shadow of doubt regarding
  the little known details of the places where I will travel. Portugal is a blessed
  center of interesting spaces, people and challenges. I will try to bring the unknown
  in a land that is known, exploring with greater incidence the climatic varieties,
  the local folklore, linguistics, gastronomy and landscapes.'
