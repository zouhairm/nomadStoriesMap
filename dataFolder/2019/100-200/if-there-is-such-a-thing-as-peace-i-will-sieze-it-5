Text: My goal is to visit small communities in Portugal and do research about how
  to bring peace to the small communities. When I finish that, I plan to write a book
  of at least fifty pages of how an individual can bring peace to where they live.
  But, The question is why small communities and not big communities? I believe that
  if I start in a small community, one they will come together as one and will be
  able to help the big community to find peace, and also help each other. My dream
  of the future is to bring peace to this world, so I believe if I write this book,
  I will be able to help this cursed world!
