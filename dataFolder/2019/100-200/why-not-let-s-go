Text: 'When the reality is heavier than any dream.

  I heard before about the carnival in Tenerife,  so 3 friends decided to go and we
  saw boys,  girls of all the ages dancing they were dressed like a king,a jail prisoners,cowboys,
  some friends in the same theme, a picture or the painter, some were original, but
  that wasn''t important, the principal idea was to have fun... No matter if you are
  rich, poor,old,young... Everybody can be whatever he wants  ... In carnival you
  can be a strawberry or a watermelon,... A journalist or Bill Laden, the limit is
  you imagination, So the  idea is to keep this idea to the rest of the year an still
  dreaming.Are you ready? I am desperate to repeat the experience,..'
