  \ sights and beautiful people.India is known for diversity in region, diversity\
  \ in languages, diversity in food, diversity in clothes, diversity in festival,\
  \ diversity in states, diversity in everything.land of beauty I call it.\nIndia\
  \ is still a craze to so many foreigners towards its beauty and maginficance. \n\
  Right from the villages cities mountains hills and ocean, everything has its own\
  \ beauty in different forms.\nWhen we try understanding people of different cultures\
  \ in the micro level,the bonding and the love  of the families  gives a goosebumps\
  \ to the outsiders.\nHer beauty not just lies in the appearance but also in her\
  \ different cultures,people and languages."
