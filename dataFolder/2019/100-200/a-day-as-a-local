Text: Wondering around Paris aimlessly is good but you might miss out so much fascinating
  information that will make you fall in love with the city. Making a friend with
  a local would be the best decision I've ever made which benefitted both of us in
  so many ways. Learning and exchanging cultures while sipping a cup of coffee with
  a view of the city on top of Montmartre was stupendous. Going to places in Paris
  that has a huge history was overwhelming knowing the city that is currently what
  we know now had been through a lot of unthinkable things and had been ruled over
  by many. Besides the dreadful past, Paris is famous for being the city of love where
  couples dream to spend their honeymoon with the spectacular view of the Eiffel Tower.
  Locals are creative with street art that you can see all around the city and the
  French food tastes scrumptious if you went to the right store.
