Text: 'A beautiful tour to this country i couldnt imagine in my wildest dream woulld
  turn out to be my loved yet favourite one....my first trip to this land has become
  such a memorable event of my life that words fall short to describe it...

  It was a year ago i had a trip to china for an internship programme..it was all
  new for me and the the first trip i hve had made out of the country.The language
  especially became a hurdle for me with which i had to struggle for good amount of
  days spent there...just because of this language barrier i could not have my meals
  properly..'
