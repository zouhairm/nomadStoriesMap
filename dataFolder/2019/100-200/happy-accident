Text: "Familiar but foreign,\nQuirky & chaotic\nWith pockets of magnificence, mystery,\
  \ and splendor\u2026\nYet so exotic!\nIt's something that I can't explain\u2013\n\
  I feel MAGIC pulse through my veins!\n \nTo start every day with a kiss from the\
  \ sun \nNothing less than a small miracle to enjoy by everyone\nThe sublime romance\
  \ of the parejas in the park,\nThe exuberant ni\xF1os running through the fountains\
  \ after dark\nThe medicine man that comes a ayudarte when you fall,\nLos amigos\
  \ who stay up until 2am when you call\n \nGente rich in generosity\n   dedication\n\
  \      contentment\n         respect,\nBeautiful minds that I will never forget\n\
  \ \nThe gifted musicians pouring their souls onto the streets\nThe dIvine comida\
  \ I\xB4ve had the pleasure to eat\nZiplining through the forest without a care on\
  \ Earth\nWishing I\xB4d had such a surreal life since birth\n \nA myriad of experiences\
  \ puedo solo have here,\nLEARNING TO LIVE A LIFE WITHOUT FEAR\n \nSo when you ask,\n\
  \xA8What makes Mexico so wonderful for me?\xA8\nThere are an INFINITY of answers,\n\
  Would you like just three?\n \nNot a city or country\nhave I written a poem.\nGuess\
  \ it's safe to say\nTHIS IS MY NEW HOME."
