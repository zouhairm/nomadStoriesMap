Text: 'In many opportunity, we usually didn''t get a chance. Once we have it, we should
  be able to take it.

  You can say that the world''s history are written by the Portuguese.

  In around 15th century, many of great worlds adventurers and explorers are came
  from Portugal.

  They have discovered many east unknown worlds to the European and connect them by
  cultures, tradings, passion to the unknown, religion and personal desires to make
  their mark in the book of human history as explorers, discoverers and as a missionary
  faithful army of God. To make those things closer by building communications and
  cooperations in many ways.

  This is my "A chance of a lifetime" moment take, to make my mark in the book of
  history that I have a chance to visit and explore the land of great worlds adventurers
  and explorers, the ancient connector, the first gate of world''s unification.'
