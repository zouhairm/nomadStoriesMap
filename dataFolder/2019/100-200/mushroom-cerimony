Text: "Was already more than a year that I was in Australia. My trip is been about\
  \ circus and organic communities, that's all I wanted to research. I used to travel\
  \ alone. I learned that both those things are not separable from relationships with\
  \ people. At a certain point happened that we were 3 of us in a farm, somewhere\
  \ in Australian's bushes, and they asked us if we wanted to be part of a cerimony\
  \ with mushrooms. Skeptical, we decided to not loose the opportunity to get in touch\
  \ with that something.. why people always got drugs? Why is it so powerful? How\
  \ powerful can it be in a place in the middle of nowhere, with no phone reception,\
  \ and with a guide, with someone that cares about you in a safe space - a wood temple\
  \ in a jungle? \nWas beautiful. I cannot really remember what happen to my heart,\
  \ but for sure my soul was touched."
