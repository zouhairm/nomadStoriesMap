Text: "My wife and I went to Hawaii as part of our cruise for 4 days in October 2016.\n\
  \nWe went to Oahu, Maui, Kauai and Hawaii (Big Island). Everyone knows about Pearl\
  \ Harbor and Waikiki but we chose to go on a dinner cruise looking at Honolulu's\
  \ coastline. \n\nOn Maui, we chose to go to a pineapple plantation because we both\
  \ like pineapple. Beforehand, we had a filling lunch on the way there. \n\nOn Kauai,\
  \ we went on a river cruise, where we were greeted by Hawaiian musicians doing a\
  \ wedding song and my wife got a hula lesson on the way back. \n\nOn the Big Island,\
  \ we were shown different coral after boarding a glassbottom boat at Kona. Amazing\
  \ views looking back towards Kona. At Hilo, we toured a Macadamia factory and a\
  \ tropical zoological garden after going to see a waterfall on the way. \n\nOur\
  \ cruise also ported in Fiji, Samoa, French Polynesia and 2 ports on the top of\
  \ New Zealand but the highlight was Hawaii."
