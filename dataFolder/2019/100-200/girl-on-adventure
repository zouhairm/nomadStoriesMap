Text: I started my journey with exploring to new places by trekking and used to go
  every weekend to new places and get new experiences, were I have went on trekking
  for 115 places and covered almost all western Ghats, I got explored to many unknown
  places and I could go without any fear and run around all places , travelling is
  most refreshment to everyone should have in their routine period . I got explored
  to many places were I could see different cultures and different people in around
  were i could get thoughts on things and I would try to explore even more destinations
