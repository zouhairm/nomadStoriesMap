Text: "I met a large sized family from Guatemala in  the US. I can say that after\
  \ they took flight in the US, I was able to see alot of my desired destinations\
  \ and plan my dream life internationally.\n\nAfter meeting someone special from\
  \ Italy I couldn't help but wait to see the rest of the world. I mmet the most amazinf\
  \ friends and family in Italy anyone could ever know. I even inherited an Italian\
  \ Legacy from Europe. It was love at First sight.\n\n It was when I lost my boarding\
  \ pass that I was left stranded with Guatemala in the USA. Fortunately, most of\
  \ my friends and family are married.\n\nEver since then I have been on this Journey\
  \ with Italy at a distance. I met someone new but I was never the same again. \n\
  \nNow I am looking to begin anew in a new space. I hope to keep traveling and maybe\
  \ make out to Italy again."
