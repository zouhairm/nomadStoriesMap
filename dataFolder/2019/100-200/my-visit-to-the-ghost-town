Text: It was six am and I rolled over to snooze my alarm, before remembering that
  today I was the day I was visiting the exclusion zone. It was -2 degrees and the
  short walk was a relief as I could barely keep my eyes open. We boarded the coach
  and where amongst a group of twelve people, who I was unsure if were clinically
  insane or just a bit curios, like myself. After a brief introduction a 2 hour journey
  began. Alongside a YouTube video of the tragedy, we were told the rules we had to
  follow and were made to sign a waiver, which was the moment the reality of where
  I was going began to sink in. We drove through icy roads and the snow topped and
  the houses started to become more and more scarce. After a final security brief
  about not taking any photos of the checkpoints or borders and being greeted by the
  military officer with an automatic gun, we had arrived at Chernobyl.
