Text: "Portugal is an ancient place and holds significant historical allure for people\
  \ around the world. As a student of European history and a passionate travel writer,\
  \ it exhibits certain charm and mystery for me. \nBeing a journalist from Pakistan,\
  \ I can assert that the general public remain unbeknownst to the relations between\
  \ the two countries. Interestingly, Portugal was also among the first countries\
  \ to term Pakistan safe for travel after a series of army-led operations in the\
  \ country\u2019s scenic north, which primarily restored peace.\nIn my story I would\
  \ like to explore the facet which brings the two countries together in a display\
  \ of soft power. The story will reflect how much nationals from Portugal know about\
  \ Pakistanis while how I as a Pakistani delve into their cultural horizon.\nIt will\
  \ also include speaking to locals, creating a connection and comparing food of the\
  \ two countries.\nMeanwhile, the story will also go into a historical background,\
  \ exploring how the country is different from rest of the Europe and which particular\
  \ factors set it apart from the others."
