Text: "Waking up early to the sound of ocean waves outside my window and light streaming\
  \ into my room on the first day of my December holiday sparked a new love of Durban\
  \ in my heart. \n\nHow could I have lived in such a beautiful city without taking\
  \ advantage of every little bit of beauty it has to offer? How much more could this\
  \ country offer me? \n\nThis began my exploration of South Africa. The beginning\
  \ of my search for food, beauty, culture, adventure and diversity. \n\nMy first\
  \ intentional encounter with a South African wonder, the tsitsikama forest in the\
  \ Eastern Cape, came when my friend and I were surprised with an all expense paid\
  \ trip to Knysna, Morgan\u2019s bay and the infamous Tsitsikama forest. \n\nAfter\
  \ much anticipation, we boarded the flight to East London and took a taxi to the\
  \ Tsitikama Forest.\n\nTo be continued"
