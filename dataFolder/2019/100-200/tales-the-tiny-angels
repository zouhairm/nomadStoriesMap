Text: In the biosphere of mother earth, every one of us is busy in findings and discovering
  new things. But we are missing some tiny angels which balance the ecosystem of the
  mother earth. they are nothing but the insects which inhibit every habitat on the
  earth. I want to expose these tiny angels to the world by my letter of words that
  how they speak in their way with us. They are not different from other but far superior
  to all. As Insects lover, my purpose is to tell the tales of these tiny angels to
  the whole world. Some of them are butterflies, moth, wasps, honey bees that they
  play an important role in nature. By visiting and connecting every part of the world
  it would be possible to tell their story to the world. They are the angels of love
  and peace which speak the language of soul with the world and nature.
