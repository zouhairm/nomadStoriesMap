Text: Since I was 13 years old my dream has always been to study in another country,
  in 2014 I tried but I could not because my US visa was denied, and since I have
  tried, but my financial conditions do not allow me to go! Today I'm 23 years old
  and I'm going to get married, and with an incredible man ... but this dream is still
  alive in my heart. I've gotten up several times crying because I'm afraid I can
  not fulfill my dream, and I know that getting married would be even more difficult,
  I'm afraid to give up on my dreams, and sometimes I think, 'Would marrying really
  be a right choice? '' As much as I love him very much ... I just wanted to get the
  chance to realize this dream before getting married! I saw the page of this site
  by instagram and a hope arose in my heart, and I wanted to send this letter! Maybe
  it's not what you're looking for, but I tried it with all my heart! - Gabriela Figueiredo
