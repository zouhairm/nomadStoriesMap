Text: Curious about an visit to an unknown place. Millions of people who are unknown.
  Landed and dove to my hotel. Beautiful site of the place from the balcony. Waiting
  to explore, found a group of people who wanted to explore too. Had crazy fun at
  Batu Caves, Eiffel Tower and KL Tower. Chilled out at the hotel for a day. Explored
  the night life at the local market and totally done for that day. Final day was
  to visit the new malaysia and the amazing china market. They are so amazing places
  to visit. The local people are really amazing they gave us more joy and fun into
  the trip. Hurry to the local people of Malaysia.
