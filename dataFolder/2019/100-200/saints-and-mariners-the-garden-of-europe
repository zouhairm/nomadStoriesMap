Text: "The Kingdom of Portugal, a long and wild story. Built in the midst of war,\
  \ a land of saints, scholars, artisans and mariners, that spread throughout the\
  \ entire world, seeking fame, fortune, conversion and discoveries. A country at\
  \ the edge of Europe but the center of the world. Another Eden, with a storied history.\
  \ To draw the stories, to seek to unite the disparate epochs, people, the saints,\
  \ the sinners, the heroes, the villains, to traverse the country of Salazar, of\
  \ Fatima, to find it's soul in her monuments, her people and the continuing story,\
  \ that continues to be written. To find that spirit, with her diverse offshoots,\
  \ yet unified theme, to capture the inspiration that spurned them on for centuries.\
  \ That is the story that needs to be continually told. \n\n\"Arms are my theme,\
  \ and those matchless heroes\nWho from Portugal's far western shores\nBy oceans\
  \ where none had ventured\nVoyaged to Taprobana and beyond,\nEnduring hazards and\
  \ assaults\nSuch as drew on more than human prowess\nAmong far distant peoples,\
  \ to proclaim\nA New Age and win undying fame.\" - Lu\xEDs de Cam\xF5es"
