Text: "Dear Sir, I am Hidayat Jan Tanai from Afghanistan and I am running a charity\
  \ organization in Afghanistan name is ASSHO. I am so interested to be participating\
  \ in the adventure scholarship. From last seven years I traveled to some countries\
  \ and I share my travel experience with my team in Afghanistan and I took a lot\
  \ of pictures and stories about the famous places. Now we have a strong team in\
  \ Afghanistan and the team members are busy to spreading the message of tourism\
  \ and they are working for Humanity. If I will be successful candidate so I will\
  \ share my experience with them and I will learn more about adventure and tourism.\
  \ \nThanks"
