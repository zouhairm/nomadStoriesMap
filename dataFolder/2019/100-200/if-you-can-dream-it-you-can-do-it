Text: My first and last trip was when I went to the United States to Disneyland, that
  trip I was planning alone for 6 months before my departure, the days were approaching
  and I could not contain the emotion that was inside me and at the same time fear,
  I approached the day and got on a plane for the first time was very fascinating,
  I saw the sky so close and the ground miles ... I arrived in florida at my hotel
  near the park and as I say could not contain the joy I felt, I I felt like a child
  again, I came to the entrance of disney and everything was magical, both adult and
  child crying seeing for the first time like me so much that I only watched on television,
  the Cinderella caitillo, the princesses, the simpsons, mike mouse and his friends,
  harry potter, could not contain the tears of truth that never wanted to leave me
  there ... I knew I would love to continue doing that ... continue traveling and
  know new places and cultures
