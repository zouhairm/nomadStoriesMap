Text: "37, twice divorced, mother of a busy 4 year old and living back in the sleepy\
  \ seaside town of Port Elizabeth - this is not how she\u2019d imagined her life\
  \ turning out.\n\nStuck in a mundane job and desperate to escape the superficial\
  \ and polite friendships. Longing to travel and feel the freedom and exhilaration\
  \ that comes with adventure - new places, new people, new lessons and ultimately\
  \ self discovery. \n\nAnd then a once in a lifetime opportunity is presented...\n\
  \nAn opportunity that teaches her to let go of her past, to make peace with her\
  \ demons  and reminds her what it feels like to be alive. People, places and experiences\
  \ that teach her to be SIGNIFICANT in her own life, her sons life and find the long\
  \ lost essence of who she is."
