Text: It was not late in march went I was accepted to take part in the Yale young
  African scholar program in ghana I was so surprise because it was my first travel
  experience. Early in August if 2019  I took the flight to Ghana Accra city with
  five other Liberians ..at my arrival at kotoka airport in Ghana my suit case got
  missing, this got me so sad I was quit not happy with the trip but fortunate for
  the the admission officer at the program brought me clothes..  After 13 hours at
  the program I meet the amazing friend ever in the world ,he was from Nigeria he
  is the coolest kid ever in the world ,there after I meant 130 others at the Program
  we play games ride bicycle and went swimming. Early on August 20 2018 it was time
  to say good bye .I could not stand the fact that I would not see them again the
  ties keep coming by I still have to say good bye and left ........
