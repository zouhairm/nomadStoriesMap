Text: I was traveling in Rajasthan ( City of Sands & Rich Culture). One day I was
  having breakfast in exotic fort with sunrise that morning, I saw a sad girl so out
  of curiosity I tried to council her. She told be behind the rich culture of this
  place there is a ugly lies where women are treated like servents they are controlled
  by elder women and not allowed to go out of home, they are forced to do PARDA. She
  was a lawyer but still trapped in that society. So I asked myself is this Rich Culture
  just a lie ?
