Text: This story begins in 2017, when a couple of young boyfriends, Fernanda and Julio,
  decide to plan their first international trip together. It was not difficult to
  find their ideal destination, and soon both chose Portugal their favorite, after
  all the affinity for the country and its beauty are undeniable. From then on, preparations
  were made for the long dreamed trip, and with it came the cut of expenses and studies
  on the country. In the middle of October of this year, everything ready, passage
  bought, rented accommodation, now just embark right? Not exactly, Fernanda 1 day
  before boarding checked that her passport was expired 4 months ago. What to do now?
  the despair soon hit and Julius calmly gave the best possible idea "Why do not we
  go to South America?" and so the journey turned from water to wine, what was Europe
  turned America and what was Winter turned summer. Phew, passport, and identity at
  hand went on a tortuous and dazzling journey through the unplanned, blank page of
  discoveries. And so life goes on, every day a new surprise and who knows the next
  destination?
