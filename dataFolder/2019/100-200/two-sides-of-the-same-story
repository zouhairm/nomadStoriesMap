Text: "People always talk about how beautiful and extravagant Paris is. Two years\
  \ ago, on an interrail trip with two of my best friends, I stumbled into an other\
  \ side of the exact same city. \nWalking our way to our hostel we saw trash laying\
  \ everywhere and people cooking their corncobs in shopping carts on the streets.\
  \ It felt like a slumb. And a few moments later when we turned the next corner we\
  \ walked directly into the beautiful Montmatre! It is funny how you can walk five\
  \ steps and stumble into a totally different culture. \nI am not saying this was\
  \ a terrible trip an that Paris actually is quite disgusting but I want people to\
  \ know that there are more stories to tell from just one city than the popular ones\
  \ you always hear. \nLook up from your phone and explore cities, countries and cultures\
  \ with your own eyes. These are the real stories."
