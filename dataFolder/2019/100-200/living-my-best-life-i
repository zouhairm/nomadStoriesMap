Text: As a dental assistant for the northern territory government I get to travel
  to some of the remote and beautiful places in australia including indigenous communities.
  On one such occasion I was sent to Arnham land to work in the health clinic. While
  there it was anzac day, where I attended the most amazing dawn service at the local
  police station with an breakfast provided by the local community. The dawn service
  on anzac day is significant to me, as growing up my grandfather would lead the service,
  he was a pow in Japan during ww2 and this service makes me reflect every year.  After
  the service I was taken tradtional turtle hunting with local indigenous ladies then
  barramundi fishing. Then to top it off we had a bbq of fish and turtle at the most
  beautiful waterfall. This day was the most amazing experience of my life.
