Text: This year I've made the commitment to travel more. I realized that I've been
  living my life too much in the 'I don't know' and 'someday'. I want to look back
  at my life and say I did that and maybe it was scary, but I know I lived my life
  on the edge and not regretting any parts of it. I started this journey by traveling
  to Iceland for New Years Eve. I am ready to keep moving this journey forward and
  live a courageous life, while learning about other human beings, how they live and
  dive deep into their cultures.
