Text: "We are not too young nor old , We can\u2019t even define how old we are . I\u2019\
  m scared to be alone but I\u2019m more scared if I\u2019m not taking the risk to\
  \ see the world. The beauty of the world could be and the answers what is the life\
  \ is .That\u2019s why I turn my F.E.A.R into Face everything and rise , I would\
  \ like to travel the world and explore to see the different sides of life . That\u2019\
  s why Im starting to write my story and share it to all the people who gonna read\
  \ this and share the positivity. I didn\u2019t expect that there\u2019s a reason\
  \ to live and love even if in despair . You gonna meet new people and sometime you\
  \ gonna meet the person that you gonna share love and experience the real life and\
  \ world could be"
