Text: "Winning this opportunity would be one of the greatest experiences in my life.\
  \ Not only because of going to a new country, but also because of the possibility\
  \ of bringing my story to life. I'm a 26 year old Argentinian guy who lives in Buenos\
  \ Aires. Working as a community manager in an advertising agency give me the knowledge\
  \ and experience to create my future, and that's what I'm planning to do as a bartender:\
  \ being a cocktail blogger. I'm looking foward to mix my assets so I can share with\
  \ the community my experiences while drinking the best cocktails around the world.\
  \ And as I already know all about my hometown, let\xB4s start with Lisboa. Why not?"
