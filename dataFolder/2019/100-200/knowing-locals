Text: There was something which always lead me to go places and find stories knowingly
  or unknowingly, I have no clue what it was but it kept me going on and on for days,
  weeks and months and now it's a daily ritual. To know places, stories and people
  became motivation for me to go places and search for more. Seasons doesn't matter
  but it makes difference in smell and the symmetric chaos of that place. It is not
  a moment or a phase but the process which makes knowing locals important for me,
  so that I can empathetically know them and admire to my experience from their rituals
  and practices. Everyone wishes to explore their roots because they are kept aloof
  from it from a very long time, making it a more closer relation we manage to wander
  places and know people and their stories to explore our roots. This makes a big
  difference in how we see the world around us and how we perceive things to carry
  on forever.
