Text: "My story is about my trip walking from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela and\
  \ on.\n\nI set off alone after taking the bus from Madrid on a whim.  During the\
  \ trip I encountered many things from the warmth of the locals, to being almost\
  \ robbed in a field of corn by two drug addicts.  I walked through the sweltering\
  \ temperatures as much of Portugal suffered great fires.  \n\nIn Coimbra I got high\
  \ and heard the sweet music and tasted the luscious food (cheap too) I'd walk at\
  \ night, especially under the full moon, 25 days walking passing through Lisbon,\
  \ Santarem, Tomar, Golega, Oporto and many more small towns and villages, sleeping\
  \ in firestations which put us peregrinos up for the night.  Walking alone usually,\
  \ and after many adventures, I arrived finally to Galicia. I am currently writing\
  \ a book about my trip."
