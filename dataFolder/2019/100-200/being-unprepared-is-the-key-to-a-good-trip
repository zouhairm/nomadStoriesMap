Text: "First, on my last vacation I went to southern Brazil in the winter. However,\
  \ I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, where it is always hot and there are\
  \ a blue sky and sun almost every day. \nSo, I did not expect to find an extreme\
  \ cold in the south of Brazil, because I did not imagine that this cold existed\
  \ in my country.  Therefore, even being unprepared for the winter, I enjoyed my\
  \ holidays very much, I made excellent friends, I met different cities in the region,\
  \ I went to events and had a lot of fun. In addition, I have known something that\
  \ I love that is the different accents of Brazil."
