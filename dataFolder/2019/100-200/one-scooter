Text: Hoi An. It provided insight into the human condition. I would pack my day pack,
  bathers already on and jump on my hired scooter. I didn't want to know where I was
  headed, but along the way I knew I would be stopped. The local lady at dawn who
  wrote in the sand and sung a Vietnamese tune. The house cafe with no one in it but
  my a glass door fridge with assorted soft drinks, but a family who sat with me and
  made me coffee. They listened to my music through my blue tooth headphones, which
  to my surprise was completely alien to them. We translated conversation through
  my phone, we laughed and sat in awe and interest of our differences. I went back
  most mornings of 10 days there, it was special, it was just for me as no other customers
  were there when I went. I would scooter in all directions until I felt it was worth
  stopping. The Scooter and I found places and people there, that if I tried I would
  have not. Each path leading me to something new.
