Text: "It was very hot, people from all countries were there to visit the most attractive\
  \ structure in the world the \"Taj Mahal\". Wow I said, it was so big, high and\
  \ beautiful. \nI didn't expect to find something amazing like that and why so much\
  \ people were there? The explanation was in the history behind that structure, so\
  \ sad and amazing in the same time. The damages that it causes in the head of people\
  \ from India and the world. \nI was so excited to find just a place with the structure\
  \ but people were everywhere, they were exciting like I was to see all places in\
  \ that castle explore more things and enjoy the day in the most beautiful places\
  \ of India. \nEven with all that people in front of me I did enjoy that place and\
  \ I did many pictures to post in my Instagram to show to my friends about my travel\
  \ in Taj Mahal and how amazing was."
