Text: My story is about a young female doctor who after traveling the whole of Europe
  decides she wants to start working in New Zealand. She feels adventurous but she
  also feels it is her sense of duty since there is a need for doctors in New Zealand.  On
  her way to board the plane from London, she stumbles over a very grumpy young man
  who -  even though very handsome -  is very ironic and doesn't care about anyone
  about him. He boards the same plane as our young doctor.  Just as the plane is about
  to land the engine gives away and the plane crashes just off the coast of Cape Reinga.
  There are very few survivors, one the doctor and the other the man, but they don't
  know that at the beginning. At first, the woman thinks she is alone and so she goes
  on a survival mission to find the nearest point of civilization.  The adventure
  continues and is filled with many comical accidents as the two opposing characters
  try to find their way through volcanos, magical caves, and jungles of New Zealand.
  The question is...will they find their way home?
