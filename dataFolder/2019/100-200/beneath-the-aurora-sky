Text: The northern lights create this sense of mysticism when I view it from afar.
  As I keep walking on the shores and look at the silent sky with seamless lights,
  I love to believe that life has happened to me and I happened to life. I look back
  and find pleasure in failures because it made me what I am today spiritually. Those
  moments when I wished I'd died, are not fresh in my memory but those thoughts make
  me realise how naive I was to think that I wanted to die over the things that wouldn't
  even matter within a year. Yes! That is how I went from dying a thousand times within
  to living a few hundreds of times to the fullest.
