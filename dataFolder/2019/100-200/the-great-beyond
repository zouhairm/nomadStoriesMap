Text: "Since Reid was really young, he always dreamed about discovering other places,\
  \ traveling, knowing what\u2019s beyond his home land. While he was home he used\
  \ to think about all the things he had and he often asked himself, why did he want\
  \ more? Wasn't he happy? His family and friends were there, he was healthy, he had\
  \ a good economic situation but he still wanted more. \nHe wanted to see the ocean,\
  \ experience winter and autumn, enjoy animal presence, being surrounded by nature.\n\
  One day, he decides to leave, without telling anyone. \nThat\u2019s when the real\
  \ adventure starts, he will have to learn how\u2019s life out in the great beyond\
  \ while lives his dream, but not everything is as easy as it sounds..."
