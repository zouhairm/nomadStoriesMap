Text: In my B. Tech 3rd year, I travelled to North India and visited all the historical
  places like Qutab minar, Red Fort, Lotus temple, Akshardham. And from their we moved
  to Kulu Manali - the place of Heaven with full of excitement and enthusiasm. Here
  I did water gliding and in manali Parachute gliding. Here is the true place to stay
  and explore the possibility of mind set. When I moved to Nainital, Uttarakand gave
  seen the scenario of Lake surrounding three sides with mountains, which is pollution
  less area. I felt in life that, exploring the all over the world with passion, which
  costs nothing in entire life of being human.
