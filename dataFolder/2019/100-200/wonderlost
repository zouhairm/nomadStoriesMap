Text: "I bring my travel story with my educational life in Indonesia. I\u2019ve been\
  \ studying in school in my hometown Papua for 10 years. After graduated from middle\
  \ school, I went to Yogyakarta to get to the high school. Yogyakarta was so small\
  \ but lots of bad and good memories left there. I missed Yogyakarta. After graduated\
  \ from high school I went to Surabaya to get my nursing degree in university. I\
  \ sometimes go to Malang with my friends due to business life in Surabaya, but it\
  \ was good. I never experience the real traveling because it\u2019s impossible for\
  \ students to get work while studying. My parents also think that travel is really\
  \ useless and just waste money. But, I think travel is more than discover the world\
  \ but to change how we see the world."
