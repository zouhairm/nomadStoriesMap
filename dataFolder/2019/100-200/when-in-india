Text: "India a country of deep roots and diversity all around, where ever you go different\
  \ cultures will follow, people speak different languages eat different food and\
  \ even look different, that how diversified is India. \nSo I started with the the\
  \ heart and capital of India Delhi, you name it and you have it you will find all\
  \ sorts of people juggling with different works here, everyone is busy yet everyone\
  \ is free, that's how this city is. \nChandni chowk happens to be my place of visit\
  \ and my god, such narrow lanes, such huge markets, such bustling streets and horns\
  \ blowing but some how nothing of it was annoying as it may sound. It brings you\
  \ to this old city charm. People are friendly, food is amazing (please try the sweet\
  \ shops near JAMA masjid and parathe wali gali)and shopping I guess it could nowhere\
  \ be better, good bargains are always there. \nAnyways I packed up afterwards.."
