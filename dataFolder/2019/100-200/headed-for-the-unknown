Text: "India is a land full of surprises. Where there are posh and tall buildings,\
  \ there are also colourful slums. The varying lifestyles and age-old traditions\
  \ take you back into the 70s era. People have moved on to richer lifestyle but are\
  \ tightly holding on to their roots. They havent forgotten what we call as superstitions\
  \ or special beliefs. \nDelving deep into villages gives an understanding of the\
  \ true India, where each village has set of traditions and dialects you wouldnt\
  \ see elsewhere. These people have small houses and big hearts. They welcome strangers\
  \ like their own. \nOn the contrary, urban and modern middle and upper classes give\
  \ a glimpse of how these different communities live together, depend on each other\
  \ and sustain well. The ever busy working and business class make sure they do their\
  \ bit in uplifting those who need financial stability.\nWhat you see in India is\
  \ not inequality - it is just unity in diversity. Each helps the other in need and\
  \ thats how they all are motivated to go on!"
