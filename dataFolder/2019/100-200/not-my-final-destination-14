Text: Growing up...in a society full of poverty and strain.i always felt like I belong
  out there.in a sense of traveling.im a person that loves the environment I love
  learning meeting new people.i did English literature in highschool we were always
  told to write about our holiday in an essay form.i always kept the best story telling.to
  me what is traveling it is an escape from the world to discover the real world and
  it's Beauty .to share information photographs and the memories but mostly to have
  great fun and have many stamps in you're passport.i have not yet travelled to many
  countries because of finance.it is my dream to do so.
