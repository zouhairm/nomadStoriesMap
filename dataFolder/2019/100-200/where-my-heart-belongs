Text: "I am about to enter my 25th year of life. I have never felt that where I am\
  \ from is my home. So far I have traveled to 14 countries and 27 states in search\
  \ of that. This month I am finally going to the country I am looking forward to\
  \ the most. This place is India! I have never been able to explain how my whole\
  \ life I have felt a connection to this place. However through the years I felt\
  \ that I wasn\u2019t ready for the adventure yet. After this past year I have felt\
  \ that finally ready. It was the year that I tragically lost my boyfriend to a swimming\
  \ accident. He was from India. As I travel to this amazing country I am ready to\
  \ see it through his eyes and I know he will be there with me along the way even\
  \ if he\u2019s not physically there. I am ready to honor him and I hope to make\
  \ him proud."
