Text: I was given a chance to experience living the life in USA. What Americans do,
  what food they have what activities they normally do. I was there as a student,
  experiencing how to live independently. 19years old by that time, first ever to
  travel by plane and far from home. I was in Texas, the state known for cowboys and
  horses. Eating burgers, rodeos, visiting museums, amusement parks. Best part is
  making friends from across the globe. Sharing each traditions, foods, values, laughters
  and craziness. It was an amaziiiing experience I will always treasure forever. Best
  thing, I was able to earn money on my own, budgeting money and time. And I always
  wish to be back.
