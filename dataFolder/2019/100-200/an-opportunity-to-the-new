Text: Most of the time we need to leave our comfort zone to give the unknown a chance
  even if they are full of doubts, uncertainties and fears, and that these things
  will no longer dictate the path by which we will go, we open the doors to what many
  call new the scary live, to live to know each other, to re-create, to live to create
  memories and to have new experiences, with new flavors, new landscapes, new people,
  new rhythms, new thoughts and new airs, beating our wings more and more without
  the intention that one day theys will be standing still and stored in dusty drawers.
