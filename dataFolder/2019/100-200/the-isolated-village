Text: In this materialistic world where people talk about digitalisation. There is
  a wonderful world  of wonderful people with zero facilities no digitalisation. When
  I worked in AIIMS JODHPUR I used to go around 72 places to collect  data. Some of
  them are cities others are villages but what amused me that village named Udsiyar
  near border where people live with full satisfaction. They are totally cut off with
  this fashionable  city lifestyle. I used to interact with villagers. You know what
  they have.. They have a simple pure smile. In our research we have to select  20
  houses in which we do blood tests and BMI. they used to offer us tea which is made
  of sheep milk. Actually  this village  is west part of thar desert. It lies in district
  Chohtan city Barmer. Sand dunes, camel ride, water are some of the life lines. When
  we are departing from that place a question arises in my mind that it is their bad
  luck  to be at this isolated place or their good fortune to living their life with
  full satisfaction.
