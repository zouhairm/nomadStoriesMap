Text: After many rainy days, facing a very bad weather in the south of Thailand, remember
  the famous island called Koh Chang. I go to that island that had a fantastic time.
  On his way I met an Afro Peruvian, we became very good friends, coming to the town
  of Lonely Beach renting a cabin on the sea, with white sands and an unforgettable
  view of three islands. Then, my friend surprised me that he is an artisan and we
  dared to sell macrame crafts from the same cabin (Palace), leaving us very good
  profits and like sharing with wonderful people from all over the world, generating
  very good friends and daring to follow with the macrame for Europe.
