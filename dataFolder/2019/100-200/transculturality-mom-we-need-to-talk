Text: "I would have liked to write about transculturality. What if by becoming transculutral\
  \ we find answers for the questions we have been asking for so long?\nCan we speak\
  \ two languages, have more holidays to celebrate and have two homes? \n\nTrnasculturality\
  \ as a form of peaceful exploration of the inner nature and a way to live with double,\
  \ triple or more standarts. \nCan we assimilate other culture, so that we are happy\
  \ with ourselves but we are also a fully integrated member of the society we live\
  \ in?\n\nMom, we need to talk. You have to know about Aaraiolos carpets, skirts\
  \ of Nazare and about what happend on the 23 and 24 of July....\n\n\nThe travel\
  \ story comprises the following topic: ''Family''....How can we spend more time\
  \ together....Learning to overcome family issues and spend quality time together\
  \ from portugues families."
