Text: I started my adventure from Australia and got on a plane and traveled over to
  Canada to Vancouver and I landed in the main part of the town and began my big adventure
  I walked down to Stanely Park and took photos and saw great sites went to the Olicity
  bench and got a photos there and sat by the river side and watched the people walk
  by and watched the sunset and drinking wine by the ocean then going on walks through
  the rain forest and to the lakes and waterfalls then moving onto the next town and
  then getting on the skis and going down the monutains on the snow leaping over the
  bumps and landing safely down the bottom
