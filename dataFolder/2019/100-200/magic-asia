Text: 'I transited alone through eight countries. I learned to say hello and goodbye
  in six different languages. I spent days with strangers that later became friends.
  I visited more than twenty Buddhist temples; in each one of them, I gave thanks
  for an important person in my life. I slept in an elephant sanctuary. I drove a
  scooter for the first time; and fell twice. I cycled through Angkor Wat. I fell
  in love with Vietnam and its fluorescent plankton. I accepted the idea that life
  is full of cliches: things always happen for a reason, and people that you meet
  have something to teach you. I saw the prettiest smile I have ever seen. I ate frogs.
  I managed to stand on a surfing board on the third try. I sent out postcards. I
  swam with manta rays my size. I realised that my most cherished home will always
  be me, and not a physical place. Some plans did not end up as excepted, but I made
  new ones, and they where  insuperable.'
