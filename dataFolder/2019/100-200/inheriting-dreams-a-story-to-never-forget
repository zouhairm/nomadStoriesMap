Text: My story begins as a child. Ever since I was little, my grandmother is by my
  side and her dreams and desires have always been shared with me, the yearnings of
  a lady who grew up in poverty and who were not given so many opportunities to fly.
  I always told her that one day I wanted to live in another country and I heard her
  say "I never wanted to leave Brazil, but if I could know a place, it would be Portugal."
  Today, at age 80, physical conditions and Alzheimer's prevent her from living this
  experience, but her dream is protected in me. To walk the streets of Portugal would
  be like writing stories that my grandmother would live and when I returned I could
  tell her every day about each step and about how each one of them was my eyes and
  heart living her dream. This would be my way of feeling, loving, and thanking for
  everything we lived together and telling her that her story is written in the world
  and in me forever. The story that she may forget, but which I will remember for
  a lifetime.
