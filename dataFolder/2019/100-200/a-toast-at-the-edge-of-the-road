Text: "\u201CArent you going a little fast?\u201D\n\nMy hands were prone gripping\
  \ the door on my left and the dash on my right, my knuckles turning white. To the\
  \ left of the road was a cliff jutting steeply up out of view; to the right was\
  \ a cliff just as steep dropping down into a cloud filled valley.\n\nRaul cocked\
  \ an eye at me and flashed a sardonic grin. \u201CLots of accidents at this road,\u201D\
  \ he said to me sympathetically. I watched helplessly and gulped as he turned his\
  \ huge body around to grab another can from behind the seat, steering blindly with\
  \ one hand. The truck swerved. Of course there were no concrete dividers guarding\
  \ us from the drop.\n\n\u201CAlmost 20 this year alone\u201D He continued, returning\
  \ to the wheel and uncapping a Modelo. He handed me one too and I took it.\n\n\u201C\
  Thank god I\u2019m not driving with some crazy trailero.\u201D I raised the beer\
  \ to him and he nodded.\n\n\u201CNice knowing you,\u201D I said.\n\n\u201CChao bella,\u201D\
  \ said he."
