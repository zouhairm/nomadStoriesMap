Text: The culture shock was immediate as soon as I entered the country. At school
  they always talked about how the Spaniards were evil with my culture, and if so,
  I did not want to stay with the doubt. so I went to discover it for myself. my experience.
  They have an incredible culture and they are not as bad as they were painted in
  books. colonization existed many years ago and was filled with greed because my
  culture had many riches and took advantage of it, but today the Spaniards are good
  people. They respect every culture different from their own, they embrace you and
  make you feel as if you were at home. its Renaissance streets of Madrid, Barcelona
  and the old Cordova and Seville make your heart beat faster. In Spain there are
  enclosures that make you connect with yourself and places that you feel that you
  do not belong to this planet, the church of the holy family makes you feel in heaven,
  at least that's how I think it is heaven. I got lost in its streets and I found
  myself in its art.
