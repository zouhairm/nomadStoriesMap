Text: There is a time in our lives that we need to jump into the unknown. That's what
  happened on my first trip. My parents have been married for over 20 years and have
  never had the opportunity to meet other places. The money was always to pay the
  bills of the month. One day a family friend invited us to spend a weekend in the
  city of Paraty / RJ. A city known for its historical heritage and literary fairs
  - I was very overwhelmed when my parents agreed. We traveled without planning what
  we caracred in an excellent experience. Where we met other people from other places
  and a new culture and through this search for accommodations that we made when we
  arrived, we were able to explore the whole city in a short period of time.
