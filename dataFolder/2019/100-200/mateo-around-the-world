Text: "I have been scribbling some ideas for over a year now of a children's book\
  \ about a boy (or animal) that lives in different places because his parents are\
  \ English as a Second Language teachers. I lived in Chile, South Korea, and Japan\
  \ as an ESL teacher and I wanted to write a children's e-book about my experiences\
  \ but through the eyes of a little boy. \nI traveled to other countries as well\
  \ as a tourist and I wanted to incorporate that too. Mateo would have friends and\
  \ learn about the culture, cuisine, and maybe have an adventure here and there.\
  \ I wanted to focus on language that would be useful to ESL students or ELLs here\
  \ in the United States that need help improving their English or are recent immigrants\
  \ to the country."
