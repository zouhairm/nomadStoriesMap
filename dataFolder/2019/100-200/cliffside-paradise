Text: "How do you get to paradise? Well we always ask taxi drivers or people at the\
  \ airport for food advice. The latter group really rarely get to enjoy chatting\
  \ with tourists. Unless you bring up food which is a way to o es heart and we got\
  \ advice to eat at someones backyard. You order out back by there kitchen. Meals\
  \ are 10 dollar plates and you feel as though your 100 miles from every other tourist.\
  \ Thats a unique feeling for an America.  \nPick me and I will tell you the name\
  \ of the restaurant. Along with what dive sites, attractions and festivals to do\
  \ in the Caribbean."
