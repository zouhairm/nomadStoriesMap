Text: Visiting new places is always exciting, you discover something unknown before,
  you learn something new. But what about the things you have known before. Something
  a person who hasn't ever left the borders of their country will recognize at the
  other end of the world, and happily find comfort in familiar details. Is it the
  mere intuition, open-mindedness? Some say past life experience, some claim it comes
  from books. Where does this global experience find us in our lives? What is it that
  lets us understand other people and places? Look deep into each culture, and you
  will see familiar faces. The story is about recognizing ourselves in other people's
  eyes, about breathing in the familiar air, and sharing intimate eye contact with
  a stranger. There is something that unites humans, the human experience that we
  are trying to explore.
