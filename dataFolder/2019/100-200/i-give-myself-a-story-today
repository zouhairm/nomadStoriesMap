Text: "I give myself a story today. The story that gave shape to the belief I hold\
  \ on to today, that thought of not getting familiar to the concept of adjust. The\
  \ story that has beckoned me to not accept the world as it is, rather set my own\
  \ rules and ways to live my life and explore what I want, what I desire.\nIt has\
  \ been a story that has encouraged me to create a whole new version of a story for\
  \ myself and refused to become that puppet defined by the so-called society as \"\
  Ideal\".\nThe story that turned me from a na\xEFve and confused girl into a daring\
  \ human and strongly opinionated woman who can stand against all wrongs now and\
  \ be brave enough to take the leash of her life into her own hands rather being\
  \ controlled or dominated by any fucking creature in this world."
