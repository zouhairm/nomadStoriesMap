Text: 'In the north of the city of Rome, the modern residential area, there is an
  unimpressive ancient Roman ruin. Its shape is the same as the ruins all over the
  city, but it has a special name: Sedia del Diavolo "Devil''s Chair".

  In the Middle Ages, the area was abandoned. The ruin became a shelter which prevented
  shepherds and homeless people from the wind and rain. They lit up bonfires among
  the broken bricks. It looked like a huge burning seat on the ground.

  Hundreds of years passed, people read the lost ancient knowledge and learned that
  the ruins were a tomb of Imperial Age. The surrounding is not the wilderness anymore.
  It becomes the residential area of the modern Roman city. People renamed the open
  space of the ruins Piazza Elio Callistio to commemorate the original owner. However,
  his tomb itself still maintains the medieval name Sedia del Diavolo "Devil''s Chair".

  Rome is the legend of legends. Every single ruin has its own story. All are evidence
  of the glory, the decline and the rebirth of civilization.'
