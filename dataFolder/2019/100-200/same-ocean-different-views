Text: "I always loved to see the Ocean from the pier 9, in NYC. Even when the noise\
  \ and the rhythm of the City hit me over and over again. I used to run and wishper\
  \ to the Ocean. Hundreds of wishes and thoughts have been sent into this Ocean for\
  \ the last few years. \nNow I\u2019m in Portugal, nervous and excited that finally\
  \ I am in the land of my dreams, where all my dreams, thoughts and desires have\
  \ been sent. I don\u2019t know anyone or any city. I just want to explore every\
  \ little part of this coast and try to find the answers I hsve been stuck with.\
  \ \nI only know now, that my feet are here and everything seems so peaceful. \n\
  My story is about huntings the lost dreams throughout the culture and people of\
  \ a very different country. Having always the faith that all the answers are in\
  \ Portugal, hidden as a game into their places and people. Each stop on this trip\
  \ will help to understand this impossible world."
