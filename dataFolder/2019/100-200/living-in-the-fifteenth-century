Text: "Last year I went to Italy to study Italian language in a local school. \nAt\
  \ first i stayed in Recanati, an old small town on top of the mountain near Ancona.\
  \ \nThe city had walls all around it and old stone streets. It also had a Catholic\
  \ church and a main square with an ancient tower. In this tower there were memorials\
  \ of war, with names of local citizens who gave their lives by the protection of\
  \ the city. The most interesting fact was when I visited the interior of the tower.\
  \ As I climbed those staircases in circular and irregular shapes all of stones,\
  \ I could think how the soldiers of the ancient times survived and guarded the city\
  \ through that tower. When I reached the top I could have a splendid view that stretched\
  \ for more than a thousand kilometers to the adriatic sea and I could observe the\
  \ beauty of the mountain and the neighboring towns. It really was an unique view.\
  \ I felt in the fifteenth century and imagined myself living in a quiet city protected\
  \ by walls and huge towers full of soldiers. It was a unique and remarkable experience."
