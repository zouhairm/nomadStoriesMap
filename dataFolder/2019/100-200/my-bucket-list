Text: "I absolutely love traveling! Whether it\u2019s domestic or international, I\
  \ am sincerely excited about getting away for a bit. I live in Washington DC, and\
  \ so far, I\u2019ve traveled, internationally, to Spain, India,  and Mexico.\n\n\
  My passion is traveling combined with writing. I have countless places in my bucket\
  \ list to visit, including Portugal. I\u2019ve had several friends visit beautiful\
  \ Portugal and def recommendation I also visit.\n\nMost recently, I visited Spain\
  \ where I made stops in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Seville. All four cities\
  \ were a wonder experiment, but my favorite was Madrid. It had an old school charm,\
  \ delicious cafes, hospitable people, and the beautiful Royal palace.\n\nVisiting\
  \ the Palace was one of the biggest highlights because I\u2019ve never been to one\
  \ before.\n\nRecently, I started my own blog site where I write about my opinions\
  \ and many adventures. It would be an absolute Dream to visit Portugal and post\
  \ pictures and write about my experiences of the the trip.\n\nIf I could travel\
  \ for the rest of my life, I would!"
