Text: Recently i have been to valley of flowers(3352mt above sea level) hemkund(4633mt
  above sea level), kedarnath(3553mt above sea level) in Uttarakhand.  it wasn't a
  planned trip as one of my friend works in Dubai he suddenly inform me and my two
  other friends that we have to this time.. So we decided to do this trip on our bikes...
  It was so much fun and adventure to do a road trip to such a height... We were in
  the lap of nature for 1 week.. Away from the hustle of the world... Purity of nature
  was mesmerising... We tracked for more than 40km.... These heavenly places make
  you realise how small we are ... The colors of nature are so vivid. We faced many
  difficulties like rain,storm extreme cold,bad roads.. Steep roads drive was tough...
  Such unplanned trip gives you time to relive your consciousness. It's a kind of
  meditation for your soul and mind....
