Text: As she thinks to herself. I finally understand who i am. Yes it took me to a
  land i dont know. Yes my emtions are rattling inside me saying give up turn back
  your crazy for thinking this could work, and yet looking outside she sees all the
  people living their lives. And as she Looks at them so welcoming so nice. smiling
  singing playing, and the one thing she holds on to is this.thinking i am part of
  a world full of amazing life. Weather it be a simple quiet life or a life full of
  wonder. Knowing that no matter where i will be i can cherish so many wonderus things.
  i will always be apart of lifting someone up. She then continues to sit by the window
  looking out from the insiide of a simple little house full of color into the sunshine
  daydreaming of how she will always find a way to love everyday.
