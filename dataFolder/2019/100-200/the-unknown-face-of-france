Text: "My story will be built around a description of \"non mediatized  \"regions.As\
  \ I see it, most travelers forget that an important wedge of Europe\u2019s largest\
  \ Alpine lake is located in France. \"Its southern shore is a delight to explore:\
  \ the spa waters and baths of Evian-les-Bains, the intact medieval walled-village\
  \ of Yvoire, the joy of catching an old-fashioned paddle steamer across the lake\
  \ to Switzerland, paddle-boarding and other water sports on local lake beaches,\
  \ and eating local lake-fished filet de perche.\nIn addition, some other places\
  \ were smashed during the wars but retain interesting vestiges: great Maginot Line\
  \ forts; the Malbrouk ch\xE2teau; the brilliant military town of Metz, with the\
  \ most glorious Gothic stained glass in its cathedral; and then the Vosges mountains,\
  \ belying the image of the place as industrial."
