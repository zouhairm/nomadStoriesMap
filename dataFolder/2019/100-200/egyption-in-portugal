Text: "love travelling and I love languages, so imagine my excitement when I came\
  \ across a treasure trove of travel words and wanderlust synonyms that describe\
  \ how we feel before, during, and after we travel.\n\nJust like a photo can\u2019\
  t fully capture what it feels like to stand on the edge of a fjord, neither can\
  \ \u2018wanderlust\u2019 fully express how we feel when we crave our next adventure.\
  \ These travel words are literary gems which have been gathered from languages around\
  \ the world. From Japanese to Swedish, Latin to Greek, travel brochures of the future\
  \ will be peppered with travel words like of resfeber, livsnjutare, and coddiwomple.\n\
  \nWanderlust meaning\n\nAs you\u2019ll see in the list below, every language has\
  \ its own variation of how it explains and defines what wanderlust is. In English,\
  \ wanderlust means to have a strong desire for or impulse to travel, wander and\
  \ explore the world."
