Text: Well, there we were in the middle of Times Square, when me and other three girls
  that I met that week decided to go to Victoria Secret, we put the GPS to go there
  and when we were walking started raining like crazy! When we wanted to come back
  to our liders the GPS had gone down and we didn't know the trail. After we started
  run like crazy girls we found a shop market and I asked a girl that worked there
  where Times Square was, and the girl didn't know!!! After we run again we found
  a pub and I asked, again, to another girl that worked there and she told us where
  it were and we runned at there and everybody was so concerned, because we were almost
  lost the bus. But in the end everything's goes well, and that's what matters.
