Text: "After graduation my friends and I booked a spontaneous getaway to Thailand,\
  \ the trip was initially supposed to be 5 days but we extended it to 3 weeks to\
  \ explore Thailand. In our time there we we to Bangkok, Phi Phi Island, Phuket,\
  \ Maya Don Island, explored Monkey beach and got to live in a beautiful villa called\
  \ Layan. \nIt was truly amazing and a life changing experience getting to know the\
  \ locals, eating authentic Thai food, exploring the markets. My trip to Thailand\
  \ taught me a great deal about myself and my impact on the earth. I didn\u2019t\
  \ know what career route I wanted to take but l that I wanted to work with people\
  \ suffering with mental health issues and when I returned from Thailand I became\
  \ a mental health support worker because my time there allowed me to focus on what\
  \ I want to do and how I wanted to develop, as well as the first steps to a career\
  \ in mental health."
