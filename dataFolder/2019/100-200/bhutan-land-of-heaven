Text: I expected to relaxed when I started to travel. But the travel provided me more
  than what it has to. Strangers became friends whom I am still in contact.  Everything  around
  their country and their ways of doing it. Their love for their king and other people.
  The King takes care of his country and takes care of his peoples needs and in the
  same time tries to preserve the nature. The people in the country also support their
  king to preserve  and follow his rules  to maintain a peaceful life.A mesmerising
  nature surrounded by mountains and the city in between them. A simple life away
  from all the clutter just rejuvenates the mind and body. Explored their culture,
  stayed with people. A treat to the body and mind.
