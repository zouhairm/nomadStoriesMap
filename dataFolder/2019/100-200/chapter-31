Text: "I don\u2019t know what to expect.\nI don\u2019t know what should I do.\nJust\
  \ embrace it.\n\nSometimes, life can gives us the best moment in our lives. But\
  \ the best moment usually is unpredictable. Never thougt of it, just feel it. Portugal.\
  \ I just know that there\u2019s a lot of famous football player, like Christiano\
  \ Ronaldo, Pepe, and Andre Silva. Like, really they are from Portugal? My boss really\
  \ admire Christiano Ronaldo, he\u2019s one of the good example of work hard and\
  \ dedication. But for me, Christiano Ronaldo is the best example of humanitarian.\
  \ I remember, on 2004, there was a big Tsunami hit Aceh, and there were a lot of\
  \ saperated family, even an orphans. But he\u2019s helping them. You know you\u2019\
  re doing the right thing, when you feel it. Yes, you! So for me, Portugal is more\
  \ than a country to visit to, but a culture and habit that I should learn about.\
  \ If I got a chance to visit Portugal and learn about the culture and habit, I will\
  \ be very honoured, because it\u2019ll be my best birthday gift, to my best chapter\
  \ of my life, chapter 31."
