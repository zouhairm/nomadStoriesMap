Text: Five months ago I embarked on a journey that changed my life completely. I filled
  out numerous applications, packed my bags, and flew across the world to Ireland
  to study abroad for four months. Since this was my first time leaving home, I was
  quite unprepared for all that I was presented with, including traveling alone, having
  my own apartment, and managing my own finances. Through this experience, however,
  I was able to gain a sense of independence, responsibility, and appreciation for
  my own country (Canada). During my time in Europe, I managed to visit 6 different
  countries and gain friendships that will last a lifetime. I ended up falling completely
  in love with Ireland, and have made it my goal to take my graduate studies back
  there. One day, I hope to call it home.
