  to know the unknown and thats what drives me and motivates me to travel to know
  things that i dont know, to share , to give to find connections to explore my self
  for my higgest good , stay true to my self the world never stop to facinate my soul
  , good people in the world natures animals the elements of earth and the universe
  these are the things thats been manifesting. I found that this offer can be the
  brigde to connect me into the world.
