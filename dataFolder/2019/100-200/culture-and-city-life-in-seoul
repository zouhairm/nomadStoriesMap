Text: "Last October I visited my friend in Seoul, South Korea. She spent a semester\
  \ in the Asian metropolis and I figured I need to grab the chance to find out how\
  \ life was treating her there. Since it was her midterm week I had to spend a lot\
  \ of time and exploring by myself.\n\nSeoul doesn't only have a great nightlife\
  \ and vibrant, stylish community to offer, but also a lot of cultural heritages.\
  \ For less than 10\u20AC you can get a pass that lets you enter every temple and\
  \ a shrine. The vibrant colors of autumn gave everything a colorful and magical\
  \ glow that stunned me since I'd never seen anything like it before. \n\nThe different\
  \ districts of Seoul are so diverse it almost seems like you're not in the same\
  \ city anymore if you get off the subway at the next stop. The food is very affordable\
  \ and spicy. We went out every night for food and karaoke."
