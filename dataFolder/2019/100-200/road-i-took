Text: "It was mid June. After completing my high school I went for my ancestral village\
  \ trip with my friends. We took a bus for it. In morning our journey started. Very\
  \ soon we came out of the city. Now we were entering into new world which was known\
  \ but we had never went through. Our window was open and hot air were passing by\
  \ touching our cheeks. The roads were dusty but was surrounded by forests. After\
  \ 3 hours we entered into village. My uncles was waiting for us on bus stop. Then\
  \ we went my home. We ate Saag-Bhaat a traditional food of Bihar. After that our\
  \ uncle took us to garden. There were many mango trees in the garden. We pelted\
  \ some stones targeting mango fruits but couldn\u2019t hit. Uncle helped us and\
  \ hit dozens mangoes. We enjoyed the mango. Then we came to home. In evening we\
  \ went to river side. The clean water was flowing in river Ganga. At the bank of\
  \ Ganga there were fields of maize. We baked some maize and ate. We came very late\
  \ at home in night."
