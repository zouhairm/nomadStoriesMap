Text: Beauty of its own, every place has it's own essence, the place which makes you
  calm away from your daily pressures, makes you smile when you see it's beauty with
  out you knowing it is really something that one should experience in a life time.
  Just by walking on it's street itself makes you think twice "is it a dream? am I
  really walking in the streets?" seeing any thing makes you think what a great artistic
  vision that god has. The sun raise and the sun set makes the place so beautiful
  that you get confused which is the best. You do not need an artistic eyes to see
  the beauty as you feel it with your whole body. Every person has their own way to
  describe a place I have one too...... but what can I say more as you people already
  know what ever I say I cannot practicality make you people feel it's beauty.........
