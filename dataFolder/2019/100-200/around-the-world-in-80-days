Text: "The world has become a global village, however, there are still some aspects\
  \ that a majority of the people don't know. In that, it's only some elements of\
  \ some places on earth that are elevated and not others. \n\nMy travel story aims\
  \ to uncover the quiet home town that no one bothers with and yet it holds the secret\
  \ to the best resources on earth. Not only, in one continent but in all the seven\
  \ continents of the world. It should be a sequel to the book around the world in\
  \ 80 days which I felt didn't do a lot of justice to some far-flung areas on earth.\
  \ \n\nApart from the physical features of various places on earth, it will also\
  \ delve into the culture, traditions, and even economy of these places. It should\
  \ be able to connect to various people in different levels. This story will be a\
  \ total insight that will cover every part of the earth and it will reveal various\
  \ aspects that anyone would want to be informed about."
