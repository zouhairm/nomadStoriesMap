Text: "I dislike entering book shops. Every time I walk into a book shop, I will end\
  \ up buying one.\n\nI entered an international bookshop in Eixample, Barcelona,\
  \ while looking for some cool things to do in Barcelona. And as expected, a book\
  \ named \u201EThe dead alleys of Barcelona\u201C got my attention, a crime novel.\
  \ Long story shot: I bought it, went home, and started reading.\n\nIn this book,\
  \ the author Stefanie Kremser talks about a special part of El Born, downtown Barcelona.\
  \ She describes this magical square, this narrow street the main character lived\
  \ in.\n\nI didn\u2019t know this exact street, and I was curious. I went downtown,\
  \ wandered around the square and saw this caf\xE9 with the few tables on the terrace.\
  \ Until today, and years later, it is still my favorite caf\xE9 in Barcelona \u2013\
  \ thanks to this book!"
