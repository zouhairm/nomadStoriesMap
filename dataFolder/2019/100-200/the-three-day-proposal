Text: I arrived in Bali around midnight. My friend who had flew in before me insisted
  that I not go to bed as there was so much to do and see. We needed celebratory drinks!
  This was our vacation and curfews would not be tolerated. After hopping around a
  few bars we retired to my hotel room with her new found Egyptian friend. We danced
  together and promised we would be going and wild forever. The next morning, despite
  my atrocious jet lag she coaxed me into slagging off the pick up van that was supposed
  to transfer us to our week long surf and yoga retreat and instead we headed over
  to Potato Head. Within a few hours she had met an Australian bloke who was vacationing
  with his brother. Please tries ensued along with copious amounts of booze and two
  days later the brother and I tied the knot. That was 2.5 years ago. Since that day
  we have been travelling, blogging, exploring and sharing our love of travel with
  others. As I write this we are sitting in T2 at the Melbourne airport waiting to
  depart to the Phillipines. Xo
