Text: "How to be rich without money. Everyone\u2019s aspiration in nowadays is to\
  \ own cars, houses and clothes, but that does not really make us rich. People want\
  \ to find its happiness in the material things, the problem is not what we have\
  \ neither what we want. \n\nFor real happiness we do not need anything, just to\
  \ feel alive. Children are the perfect example of how to be happy all the time and\
  \ maintain the enthusiasm for life, the search of the unknown. That is how I decided\
  \ to travel to Cuba, an island commonly known by its happy people although they\
  \ are poor.\n\nIn this trip I learned to live with just a bag and a little amount\
  \ of money I earned this summer as a bar tender. Nevertheless, I never have been\
  \ as happy. I left aside the ego and the material things society made me believe.\n\
  \nI\u2019ve seen God every day, in people\u2019s soul. Magic is all around the world\
  \ and we just need to realize to apreciate it. The search is everything. My book\
  \ will show you the way for happiness for the rest of your life, you just need to\
  \ believe."
