Text: "It was my first time on plane and i was traveling from Jammu to Delhi. I was\
  \ anxious as to how to board a plane and things like that. A stranger was sitting\
  \ next to me detected my anxiety and nervousness so he offered to help me with the\
  \ seatbelt. I had no choice but to accept. Then we shared our passion for travel.\
  \ He told me to visit this one place in Delhi. I made sure to go Bangla Sahib and\
  \ you won\u2019t believe I was beaming with joy without any reason or maybe we never\
  \ do need a reason to feel happy. That place was full of people and crowded and\
  \ what not. But it was all worth it."
