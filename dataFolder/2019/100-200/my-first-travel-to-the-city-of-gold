Text: For someone from rural areas, I have always wanted to visit other big places
  and see different things and different people. Even before I could manage to leave
  my village for Johannesburg, my imagination had already traveled to so many places.
  I took a first chance I got to go to Joburg, not knowing what to expect. When I
  arrived to the City of Gold, things were different from where I was coming from,
  big buildings, streets, so many different languages. I have learnt a lot of things,
  new experiences and memories. The beauty of traveling is to discover new things,
  learn about other people's cultures and their way of doing things, it gives you
  an opportunity to experience, experiment and explore. I love to travel and go around
  listening to people's stories about their places and their history and life in general.
  I would love to get a chance to travel more and experience more. I love both traveling
  and writing. Doing both of that would be a dream come true.
