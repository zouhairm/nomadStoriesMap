Text: On the way to cafe du monde between the old red brick of Bourbon St. & the Mississippi
  river is Jackson's Corner. A place where people of all ages, demographics & walks
  of life move steadily through sidewalks selectively & simultaneously observing &
  disregarding the existence of each other. Some walk side by side thru St. Louis
  Cathedral or stop next to others as they watch street performers or admire art.
  What's undeniable is the culture & the experience of love & heartbreak, for the
  history & the people. Be it the marble chambers of Lafayette cemeteries or the scars
  & bruises of passersby, if you visit NOLA you will be reminded of your humanity
  & all the hope, messiness, despair & hope that it brings at times & sometimes all
  at once. (Another undeniable fact - best veggie omlet & mac & cheese you've ever
  had)
