Text: Travel. I think whenever you get a medium or large pack of holidays don't waste
  it your time by simply sitting into home and watching that idiot box all day long,
  just open your wardrobe pull out the bag and load that bag with all the things you
  need into a trip. Go to some random places or a place where you've never been before.
  You meet some of amazing people's or might meet some kind of rude people's in your
  trip but trust me those people's you'll remember all over your life time period,
  sometimes itz good to travel any other country because you might get to learn a
  different culture and you meet totally different people all around that country
  they will help you to explore their country and as well as they will be too friendly
  with you
