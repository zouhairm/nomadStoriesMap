Text: "It was a fine autumns day, on 6 April 1652. Finally the sailors got sight of\
  \ a piece of land. But was it safe, could they set sail for a few days? \n\nLet\
  \ me fast forward histroy a bit. Okay so at the moment I'm staring at the piece\
  \ of land my ancestors fought on. Blood and sweat was spilled on these battlegrounds\
  \ before white flags were raised. I'm staring at this picture in a geography textbook\
  \ I took out in the public library. How many people know what happened at Bloodriver\
  \ in December 1838, were  470 Pioneers, led by Andries Pretorius, faced 10,000 to\
  \ 15,000 Zulsu on the bank of the Ncome River?\n\nThis is the history that made\
  \ us who we are today. Few years later I visited this sight not in the library,\
  \ but in actual reality. stepping on the same ground my ancestors step on a few\
  \ decades ago."
