Text: "On a very hot morning, I woke up as usual to face a boring new summer day,\
  \ an eleven-year-old boy who was similar to his vacation days. My father decided\
  \ to take me to a country I had never heard of before. I hated the idea of \u200B\
  \u200Bgoing to the countryside just to visit his old friend. And I do not listen\
  \ and I get exhausted until we get there, the sons of the man who were of the same\
  \ age took me to play with them. My father refused first because I was his only\
  \ son and then gave up, went and played football and for the first time I found\
  \ myself skilled in football! I discovered that I was laughing, excited and helping\
  \ my companions. In the morning I was alone I did not want to move away from home.\
  \ Now I found another life, different people and a different culture. I got to know\
  \ things in myself and my reactions to nature that I never imagined before."
