Text: "Breathe and remember:\nDon\u2019t forget where you belong,\nDon\u2019t forget\
  \ about the past, although move on.\nAlways look around you,\nLike the excited kids\
  \ in December.\n\nBreathe and remember,\nThey are also here, \nThe other men and\
  \ women.\nThe have been here before us, forever in the forest.\nThey evolved, they\
  \ bloomed, they changed. \nThey claimed mountains, they discovered lands.\n\nBreathe\
  \ and remember,\nDon\u2019t forget this world is real,\nDon\u2019t let them drug\
  \ you in the fantasy utopia.\nSynthetic emotions in the forms of pills,\nControlled\
  \ isolated bubble homes as shields.\n\nBreathe and remember,\nDon\u2019t avoid yourself.\n\
  Don\u2019t be afraid of finding too much, too little, nothing at all.\nYou\u2019\
  re not anonymous, you\u2019re not alone.\nSometimes dream of saving the world,\n\
  Saving everyone from the invisible hand\u2019s control.\n\nBreathe and remember,\n\
  Don\u2019t trust the bid words \nThey said that new technologies would\u2019ve created\
  \ thunderbirds.\nThey didn\u2019t tell us about the new man,\nUnable to see, hear\
  \ the voices of Afghan. \n\nBreathe and remember,\nDon\u2019t be indifferent,\n\
  Be different.\nYou\u2019re the new generation,\nYou\u2019re not starvation,\nYou\u2019\
  re the new creation."
