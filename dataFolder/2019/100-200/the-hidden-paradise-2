Text: As a title of my story "The hidden paradise" is it enough to describing a beautiful
  places in north Sumatra called Bukit Lawang,its just about 2 hours 55 minute  and
  88,2 kilos from Medan city,it will lead your steeps into a vast of mount Leuser
  national park.So i decided choosing the right place to spend the quarter of the
  Cabernet Merlot what i had from last summer vacation, what about Bukitlawang (again)?
  This place seems to have a 'magnet' for me and the trip to 'hidden paradise' this
  time i just playing as  'local tourist' and the place naturally guiding my self.
