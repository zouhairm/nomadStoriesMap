Text: "The third Sunday of a month. Free entry to many museums. Didn\u2019t hear the\
  \ alarm. Woke up late. Took a shower. Breakfast. Street. Greyness. Cold wind. Subway.\
  \ Paveletskaya station. Promenade. Almost no people. Old houses and narrow streets.\
  \ Feeling of devastation. Finally found. The small museum of a great poet. Yesenin.\
  \ Special atmosphere. A short but incredible life, which can be described by the\
  \ titles of poetry collections:  \u201CSoviet Country\u201D, \u201CTavern Moscow\u201D\
  , \u201CHooligan\u2019s Confession\u201D. A lot of inspiration. Old newspapers and\
  \ photos. Author\u2019s drafts. Street. Sunshine. Subway. Tverskaya station. Square.\
  \ A lot of hurrying people. Turn. Down the street. Intersection. Turn. Up the street.\
  \ The sound of church bells. Turn. Museum of modern art. Too many people. Jacques\
  \ Lipchitz. Sculptures. Not impressed. Ladder. Stained glass. Another floor. Pavel\
  \ Otdelnikov. Painter. Never heard before. Abandoned factories and environmental\
  \ disasters in paintings. Impressive. Installation: a room full of gas masks. Stories\
  \ of Soviet people written on the walls. Rethought. Street lights. Snowflakes on\
  \ the coat. No beret. The wind blew through the curls. Enlivened. Blizzard. Subway.\
  \ Disgruntled people. Dormitory. Listening to a friend\u2019s problem. Green tea.\
  \ Night. Thoughts."
