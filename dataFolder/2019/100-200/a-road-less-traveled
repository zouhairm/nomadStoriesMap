Text: The story is about a girl who grew up in the foster care system with huge dreams
  of traveling the world. Everybody in her life said that she would never make it,
  and never amount to anything. In this story not only does she prove everyone wrong,
  but she also ends up finding herself along this journey. Growing up was hard for
  her, and she was not allowed to do things that others her age could. She didn't
  have the money to travel let alone buy the clothes and shoes that all her friends
  had. In highschool she began saying how when she got old enough she would travel
  the world and emerse herself in coultures that she never had the opportunity to
  do. When she gets to these destinations she sets out on a road to self discovery
  among the different cultures.
