Text: 'It was Saturday morning when I decided to board the vaporetto in front of the
  Venice train station, Santa Lucia. I had a lot of time and the day was beautiful,
  with a blue sky calling me for adventure. Not knowing which line to choose, I thought,
  what could go wrong with me? I got on board.

  I sat in the outside area and looked at the centennial buildings that skirt the
  Grand Canal. While doing some photos, a nice Venetian poet lady talked to me and
  started giving me tips on the best places to photograph Venice from above. He invited
  me to go down and explore the city. I discovered secrets and details of the city
  that I never imagined existed. Tell me, was it dream or reality? Find out in the
  next text.'
