Text: "I was playing PS4 in my room, like everyday, when the phone started to sound,\
  \ was my aunt inviting me to travel to Mexico, I got surprised, i didn\xB4t know\
  \ what to say, i have never had traveled outside muy country, i accepted, a feeling\
  \ of happiness started to appear, i imagined how wonderful could be Mexico, i searched\
  \ the best attractions of Mexico in tripadvisor and i printed many images and images\
  \ and images about this places, I bought new cloth to wear as soon as muy travel\
  \ starts, finally the day arrived, I was so nervous to go to the airport and fly\
  \ in another country, i chose the sit with window and i was watching every simple\
  \ landscape in the air, then I woke up, and upps all was a dream, but i was happy\
  \ because mi imagination could create a new world"
