Text: I have been dreamin of goiig to ireland since i entered college. Ive read books,magazines,first
  hand experience from people that i know about ireland. I am amazed by the natural
  landscape and how its beauty has been preseved and protected for centuries now.
  When i had the chance to work as a nurse in ireland, without second thought, i told
  myself i had to leap. I can still vividly remember the day i landed in dublin. I
  was overjoyed and had tears because i cant believe it is finally happening and dreams
  do come true. I am now living in ireland and have been enjoying the spectacular
  scneneries and overwhelming nature that ireland has to offer
