Text: "Nine years ago I had the experience to stay for over 11 months in Netherlands.\
  \ During this time I met amazing people and created a strong and bold connection,\
  \ it was so hard to be only 17 y/o, far away from my family for the first time.\
  \ \n\nI would like to see how during the time, the people that I met grow up but\
  \ their essence remains ... or not. As a caring person this has been one of my biggest\
  \ fears and one of the main reasons why I\u2019m so afraid to go back. It would\
  \ be like going back for me but for them, it all stayed the same, just not me."
