Text: "Having travelled to 9 nine countries, makes me want to travel more as with\
  \ every travel comes new perspective and a new experience. My idea of travelling\
  \ is not just to unwind and explore but to completely immerse into the unknown.\
  \ \nTravelling to me brings me the utmost joy and happiness and over the years I\
  \ seem to have grown passionate about it. Food and travel are my two most favourite\
  \ things and lucky for me they go hand in hand. Wining this trip to Portugal would\
  \ be the best and the most unexpected event to take place at this point in my life.\
  \ \nLooking forward ! Na esperanca \u2764\uFE0F"
