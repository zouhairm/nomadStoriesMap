Text: I really like to travel. Me and my husband made our best to save money and have
  a incredible vacation together. Our first trip was to Europe, and we really wanted
  to do that. We went to Italy, France, Holand and Greece. He asked me in marriage
  in Vatican, was amazing! Everyday I used to put some fun videos on my Instagram
  showing how people can travel, have fun, know the world with a low cost trip. We
  visited museums, streets, saw local architecture and so many incredible things.
  We dont know Portugal yet but would be a fantastic and epic travel.
