Text: "There are a lot of things that may look usual for us but they are not for others.\
  \ An example of such those things is the food and an example of others is the people\
  \ in Somalia. \n\nIn most countries of the world, travel is an extremely easy thing,\
  \ actually, it is nothing more than a decision. The case is different here in Gaza\
  \ (a small occupied city in a larger occupied country called Palestine).\n\nSorry,\
  \ I didn't write my travel story because I do not have one yet. It would be a really\
  \ hard mission if I decided to travel from Gaza, the small city with the well-sealed\
  \ siege and a lot of barriers created by the Israeli occupation.\n\nSo, all my travel\
  \ journeys are nothing more than brief local tours inside Gaza.\n\nThe word count\
  \ below tells me that I am still able to write another 566 words. Frankly, I don't\
  \ have travel stories enough to reach that number, I will stop right now, but I\
  \ promise to write a lot of \"566\"s of words if I have the chance to engage such\
  \ an experience."
