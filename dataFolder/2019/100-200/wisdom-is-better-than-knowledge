Text: Yesterday at Entebbe International Airport, Uganda, an ILLITERATE WOMAN entered
  a plane going to Kenya. She told a HOSTESS that she wants to sit in the front row,
  the HOSTESS refused & told her to go & sit at the back row; she refused & insisted
  that she wants to sit in front. They explained to her that the front row is First
  Class & her ticket was economy class but she was not listening to any of that &
  she was causing commotion At last, the HOSTESS remembered that the PILOT is married
  to an illiterate wife. She called the PILOT to come & help them sort out the WOMAN.
  The PILOT came & told the WOMAN that "the front row of the plane is not going to
  Kenya, it is the back row that is going to Kenya." The WOMAN happily went & sat
  in economy class & peace prevailed. WISDOM IS BETTER THAN KNOWLEDGE
