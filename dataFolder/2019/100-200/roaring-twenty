Text: "Being 20 is complicated. It\u2019s the age where you\u2019re an adult, but\
  \ not exactly mature or prepared yet to face the entirety of the world. 20 is the\
  \ age of stupid choices and trial and error-it\u2019s about rediscovering yourself\
  \ and finding out what works out for you whether it\u2019s with love, family, or\
  \ life in general. My travel story is, well, me at 20. This is the story of me and\
  \ how I go from niave teens to maturing adult while traveling, trying new things,\
  \ and coming out of my shell. I\u2019m a writer and a photographer. Getting to write\
  \ about traveling to one of the most beautiful countries while acting out my travel\
  \ journey would be a dream come true for a clueless 20 year old like me."
