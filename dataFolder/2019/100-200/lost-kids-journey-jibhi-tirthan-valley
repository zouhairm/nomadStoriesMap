Text: "As it decided then, Seven lost Kids traveling together to Jibhi \u2013 Tirthan\
  \ Valley! Where not everyone knows each other was a pint of curiosity, As people\
  \ would like to travel with strangers too as they would have that curiosity to know\
  \ new people.\n\nOur Eldest Kid, Who\u2019s working with Looks \u2013 Select CITYWALK\
  \ India for almost half a decade now, Was in the hunt to take a break (Who\u2019\
  s often called by the name of Shikari, Yes indeed!) and he wasn\u2019t going to\
  \ settle for an over-commercialized and over-populated hill-station like Mussoorie\
  \ or Shimla.\n\nFunction of Friendship:\n\nAfter making endless groups and trips\
  \ on WhatsApp groups was the cancellation of one of the main member of our squad\
  \ from Ludhiana, which turned out to be a heartbreak for everyone! As if the trip\
  \ is going to be canceled. But here, I haven\u2019t mention one special friend,\
  \ of mine yet! Who is having more value in my life and if I compare \nAman Thakran\
  \ \u2018s role is that to one special card in a deck of cards as More often than\
  \ not, Special card is used to replace those cards that get lost or torn!...\n\n\
