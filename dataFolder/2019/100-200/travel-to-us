Text: 'I did travel to US 2 years back, It was related to the professional exhibition
  for IT and Telecoms sector.

  Other than exhibition days we traveled to NYC and Connecticut, which was good time
  to be together with old friends.

  In 2 weeks trip we did enjoy traveling to different suburbs and enjoyed mouth watering
  eateries.

  We planned to do a unique visit for whale watching in the mid of the sea. It was
  a nice sunny day and we got the tickets to travel to see the hump back whales. In
  actual to visit the whales our yacht must need to approach till the deep water sea.

  We were excited to see the natural big creatures on earth in their livelihood, but
  once the yacht reaches to the part of the sea where most of the whales were expected
  to be observed, our yacht was circulating in that part, but unfortunately no whales
  come up to the sea level of observation by the visitors.


  We came back even after the visit, but it was nice as we captured the natural scenes
  of the shore, meanwhile we did visit to other related places to explore the nature
  out of the city''s busy life.


  Regards'
