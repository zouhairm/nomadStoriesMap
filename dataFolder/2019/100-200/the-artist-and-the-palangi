Text: 4 years ago this month I took a volunteer role in The Kingdom of Tonga, a beautiful
  island in the South Pacific.  I intended this to be a 12 month "gap" year to learn
  about microfinancing and how it could empower women in developing countries. I did
  not expect to find myself four years later living in one of the most beautiful places
  on earth; and one that is most vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters.  But
  not only natural disasters - apart from cyclones, there have been murders, political
  instability, celebrity meetings, Coronations and deaths of royalty, appointment
  of the first Tongan cardinal to the Vatican......who would have thought this would
  be one of the most exciting and complex places to live in.  It was also the place
  I found myself and an abundance of love and laughter with the one known as the "artist".  As
  we walk down the street holding hands, I hear the local kids say with joyous giggles..."
  there's the artist and the palangi".
