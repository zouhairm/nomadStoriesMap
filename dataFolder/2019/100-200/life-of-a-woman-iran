Text: "Iran once upon a time ruled by different men has been difficult for women.\
  \ Forget going out without a scarf and a monto ( burkha ) but even at home in front\
  \ of their uncle's brothers they weren't allowed to come without a scarf. While\
  \ you were walking on the street if your hair would been seen from under the scarf\
  \ the cops would stop you & cut your hair.Employment ratio for women  was as good\
  \ as nothing Speaking to few Irani women life was never easy for them as and when\
  \ the rulers changed life for them got even more difficult but then came a time\
  \ where they decided to fight for their rights \nToday the Irani women believes\
  \ in getting educated believes in getting married at a much later stage isn't afraid\
  \ to take a divorce if things ain't right and the best part can be themselves which\
  \ all these years was restricted\nMy motto of writting is to meet different women\
  \ acrosd the world to see what we can learn from them or give them as a learning\
  \ from our life"
