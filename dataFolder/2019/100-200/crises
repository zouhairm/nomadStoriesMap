  The other participants had stood us up, so we were on our own. I felt embarassed
  at first - after all, I''m extremely shy and did not expect this to become an intimate
  one-on-one - but as we talked and went on our walk, it turned into a chance of tackling
  deeper issues: we both opened up and started talking about our personal struggles.
  I was unemployed and travelling as a way to clear up my mind, he was making ends
  meet while reinventing himself and putting up a renovation business, after the crisis
  had hit Greece and forced him to close his studio. We were both at a turning point
  in life, trying to find our identity again after a major crisis.'
