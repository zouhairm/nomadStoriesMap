Text: I have never travelled alone any where in my country to the other city but I've
  travelled to turkey alone this year and it was the first time when I got to know
  what I can do and when the first time I arrived in turkey Istanbul I said to my
  self that m alone here it's all my responsibility to take care of myself and enjoy
  and learn during this shprt trip and when I was there I were with a lot locals and
  learned their culture and told them about mine. And when in my family other members
  come to that I am in Turkey alone all were shocked because they used to think that
  I won't go alone to the other city how can I go alone to the other country. But
  I did that and not only I used this trip for entertainment and tourism instead I
  was with locals in a hostel and many more people from other countries we all had
  lots of talks and remembering moments and it was the best of my life because I took
  the decision that I can go alone. And I have done that.
