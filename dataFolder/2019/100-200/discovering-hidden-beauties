Text: 'Nigeria has been termed an unstable nation but my journey to various parts
  of the country has changed that notion because there are beautiful water falls  like
  the ejirin water fall in Ondo and massive hills  at idanre and abuja to the lovely
  osun groove and the warm ikogosun warm spring with very warm people living in those
  places.

  Lagos,the land of aquatic splendour is also a beautiful place to visit. The lovely
  view of the Atlantic ocean makes this coastal city a place to visit and the preserved
  touch of colonialism in badagry is a must see. The Durban festival at Bauchi is
  a celebration of a rich cultural heritage in the north just like boat regatta in
  the south-south. Nigeria is a beautiful place to visit and you will definitely agree
  with me.'
