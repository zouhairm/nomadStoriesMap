Text: "For my First trip in Africa, i chose South Africa, because was more simple\
  \ to drive alone, and well organized for accepting tourists. My priorit\xE0 was\
  \ meeting feline, but at the beginning, It was very hard, because feline are shy;\
  \ so i have see a lot of Elephants, giraff, pumba, gnu, and others animals. Also\
  \ Rino, but no feline. So i chose to buy a guided tour to see Lion, cheeta, and\
  \ Leopard. Was an incredible esperience, and only Leopard was Lost in my Travel.\
  \ Later i finished my esperience, visiting Victoria falls in Zimbabwe. Also that\
  \ was an incredible esperience, and i suggest to every people to do the same. Bye,\
  \ Luca"
