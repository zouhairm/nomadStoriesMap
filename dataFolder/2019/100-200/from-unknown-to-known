Text: "Actually I'm a student in Rome, I came to do my masters in Sapienza University.\
  \ But after seeing this city I really felt very happy and also mostly surprised\
  \ to see the great monuments and also there also many architectural constructions\
  \ which were being built in many centuries before. There are also some attractions\
  \ that influence the people to visit that are, Colosseum, Trevi Fountain \u26F2\
  , Piazza Vennezia, Vatican City, Spanish Steps and also many other beautiful places\
  \ that I have visited in last few months. After this I became the traveler and also\
  \ I want to travel many more places around the world. The best part is that if any\
  \ of them who were interested to visit Italy, winter is the best time to visit.\
  \ As in winter at rare cases you will find the snowfall at some regions like Sienna,\
  \ Rieti and there are many more places that snow will be there. And here the food\
  \ is really awesome and mainly that pizza it really made me my famous food. So this\
  \ is not enough stuff to tell about. So you also visit and get more stuff from your\
  \ point of view and become a travel freak"
