Text: I had been to Europe 2 times on a holiday trip and once like a student I explored
  the places like "Nice" which is situated in the South of France .I was overwhelmed
  by the people and culture of French people .It was an amazing experience to travel
  and explore the beautiful beaches along side of the Mediterrian sea .I was astonished
  to connect with French people because of their friendly and cordial behaviour .Twice
  I visited with family to France ,Switzerland ,Austria ,UK,Belgium ,Italy ,entire
  Europe is rich with great architectural beautiful monuments like Eiffel Tower to
  London Bridge to Atomium to Tranquil exquisite beauty of nature ,snow ,rivers and
  mountains of Switzerland .I enjoyed the food,culture and tradition of all these
  countries which makes it an unique experience altogether .
