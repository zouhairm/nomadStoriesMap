Text: "I love to travel and I have always wanted to go to Europe or other unknown\
  \ places to discover new cultures and food.\nI am from Ecuador and I have been travelling\
  \ around my own country for a while. My home is divided in four regions which makes\
  \ it super exiting. Well is only country but indeed every region is different and\
  \ unique from the other. I love it completely especially its people which varied\
  \ and talk in different accents. Later on I came to the United Stated where I have\
  \ discovered a whole new enviorement and biodiversity. We may see one planes but\
  \ each part of it has it\u2019s own essence. Utah has been a beautiful rocky place\
  \ as Arizona. These two places in the United States and Ecuador made me realized\
  \ the importance of knowing more of our little world and enjoy it as much as we\
  \ can."
