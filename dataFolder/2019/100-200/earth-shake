Text: 'I didnt know why i went there, only i needed to get out of my country and desconect
  a little bit...

  So, how i dindt have a lot of money, i went to ago little town in the chile north
  called "Pisco Elqui"

  So all it was going tranquile and quiet...

  I met some people, i played clarinet in no street...but in tha beautiful place some
  was hapenning, i could feel it, but i really knew what.

  One day , especifically the 3th, i went to river with a girl wich lived there, and
  she asked to me if i can reed the tarot for her, so, we started, i told her something
  to help her, and , in for future i sey to her, "dont you worry, something from outside
  is going to fix all the thuiiings and move in a good wayx just wait" , that same
  night, the earth move, the earth shake comes to us that night, and i ran away to
  nowhere.... but later that days all the thing started to going better.'
