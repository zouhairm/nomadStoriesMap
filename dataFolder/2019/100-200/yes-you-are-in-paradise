Text: "This is one of my favorites trips, I didn\u2019t know that Panama could be\
  \ soo cool in many ways. I had an amazing experience with my boyfriend, the city\
  \ was incredible but the beaches and the nature contact was more than I expected.\
  \ We stayed one night on an island called \u201Cdog island\u201D and it was a memorable\
  \ moment, also we were in many islands in the same day, that\u2019s not an amazing\
  \ memory? When we get back to the city we enjoyed a fair, learned more about the\
  \ culture and we were so lucky because we saw a typical dance, that was really beautiful.\
  \ Everytime I close my eyes this beautiful moments come back to me :).  So I recommend\
  \ Panama City, you can do whatever you want and be on a paradise at the same time\
