Text: I found myself in a foreign land, where I was a stranger to the people who surrounded
  me. I found a part of myself that I never knew existed but at the same time, I knew
  it was missing. Here I began to fall in love with the idea of life again, with the
  mere fact that I was alive and breathing. I found myself sitting by a river and
  as I approached this being... I experienced a great amount of pain. A pain that
  had grown over the years by many internal and external factors, a pain I had been
  carrying for a very long time. I was finally ready to meet my maker, to heal a part
  of me that was more than broken and I did. I fell in love with myself. I gave myself
  the peace I deserved. I healed myself with the love of being myself. My true self.
  The being I was before all of the damage of the world. By the river, the flowing
  river of second chances and hope, here is where I found myself. In a foreign land.
