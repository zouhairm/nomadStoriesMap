Text: What would Brazil look like in the eyes of a person you do not know here ??
  Well I would like to clarify doubts and show the advantages of a trip through Brazil
  you will see that there are incredible places for you to visit, besides all the
  natural beauties that our country reserves. Brazil is the country that has the greatest
  biodiversity of fauna and flora of the planet because of its tropical climate. It
  is also here that the Amazon and the Pantanal are located, two great national pride
  so that was why I told a little about what I'm proud of and would like to visit
  portugual and know the biodiversity of there like to learn more and to know more
  about the culture Good Portuguese I never did travel outside of Brazil and I did
  not want to tell something that I have not lived but something I know and I'm sure
  of what I already lived in my Brazil.
