Text: "Amsterdam boasts a fairytale landscape equipped with museums, marijuana, tulips\
  \ and cheese. If you\u2019re planning a trip to the seductive city, you\u2019ll\
  \ want to have a rough idea of what to do while you\u2019re there. And where better\
  \ to get advice from than the locals. Yep, experts out on the field but not only...\
  \ There I met any of the best people ever, they were going around the city with\
  \ me, and my GF and during our walks, we met theirs families and friends  going\
  \ on the way we became also part of their family and their friends, with them I\
  \ felt at home how as I never felt, either comparing when I was kid and I took refuge\
  \ in in my bedroom. We seriously enjoyed the kindness the beauty of their clear\
  \ souls and minds. Now we are all more strong and now we are also part of Amsterdam\
  \ .... Hugs for you guys and we wait for you soon!"
