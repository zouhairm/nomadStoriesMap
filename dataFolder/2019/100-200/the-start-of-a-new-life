Text: "When I was 21 I decided to go to R\xEDo de Janeiro, with little money. I went\
  \ to the bus \U0001F68C and started my 27 hours trip to get there. I was looking\
  \ at the amazing views while we go... I was really full of insecurities about what\
  \ will I find once I get to Rio, because I didn\u2019t really plan my trip, accommodation\
  \ and basically nothing.\nOnce I arrived at the station I used an app to meet people,\
  \ I had found a guy who hosted me, he was friendly and helped me. I had met a wonderful\
  \ person then, After that I kept meeting several people from every part of this\
  \ world, that was really unexpected and a wonderful experience. I had also saw the\
  \ beach \U0001F3D6 for the first time... My life totally changed. In the end I met\
  \ a person who is currently my boyfriend, he is from Canada and I am from Paraguay.\
  \ \nSince we are boyfriends we traveled some countries as Colombia, Brazil, Argentina\
  \ and Paraguay.\nThat experience for sure changed my life."
