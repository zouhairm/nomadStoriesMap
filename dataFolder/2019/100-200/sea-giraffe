Text: "Although fiction, this novella has been inspired by simple and continuous immersion\
  \ in the glorious Australian wilderness. In his wrinkled chivalry, old Brian Tennent\
  \ struggles to recover from a shark attack both physically and spiritually. With\
  \ greying Labrador Oort, armed with faithful black bandana, the pair explore the\
  \ mysteries of the mind, Australian history and their place in the universe.\n\n\
  Excerpts:\n\"Rich with compacted natural history, he fails to notice the creeper\
  \ vines and wandering sinews that cling to the cracks and crevices for moisture,\
  \ warmth and life. There is no thought given here to the fragility of the surface\
  \ rose, for the beauty of the creeper vine flower is in its humble and solitary\
  \ existence. Never cut, plucked, sorted or withered there is contentment to watch\
  \ quietly the dance of the fire.\"\n\n\"'..It\u2019s funny you know, I do not envy\
  \ the sun. It must be a lonely role, being appreciated unknowingly. Hold one too\
  \ close, you are sure to burn them up. Hold one too far and they are destined to\
  \ drift away forever.\u201D Brian inhales the cold starlight. \u201CHowever, the\
  \ sun is bold in its vulnerability, for the dancing of suns spark the beginnings\
  \ of life. \""
