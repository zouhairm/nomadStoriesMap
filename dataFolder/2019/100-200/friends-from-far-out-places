Text: "It is a story of friendship and loneliness, discovering new places and discovering\
  \ myself. The story of 6 months in a country that doesn\u2019t speak English as\
  \ its main language. The ways humans learn to communicate with each other beyond\
  \ just the spoken word. Through dance, sport, music and travel people can connect\
  \ no matter what their background, culture or language. Living in Spain I met the\
  \ most incredible locals and other travels and shared with them the secrets of the\
  \ seaside town of Alicante. This story is one of fiestas, playas and adventures\
  \ celebrating the importance of stepping outside of your comfort zone. We spend\
  \ days in Alicante visiting local cafes making strong connections and leaving our\
  \ mark on the city."
