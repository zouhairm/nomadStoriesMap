Text: "\"Ah Li San De Gu Niang\" is the chinese very famous song.I saw the music video,long\
  \ long ago when i was child.The view there very Amazing like country about the wind.\
  \ \n\n2014,i went there first time.I felt very surprised,actually the view there\
  \ same with the song's describtion.With many of Pretty Girls.One of the most shocking\
  \ experiences is you can find the girl selling \"pinang\".\n\nLocal guide said,\
  \ \"the more you enter the kampung,more sexy the bikini\".in Taiwan,usually the\
  \ one whose eat pinang is Hakka's people.And according to the law,it is prohibited\
  \ selling \"Pinang\" at the city.So,they sell it at \"Kampung\". can you imagine,the\
  \ natural beauty of the village,selling \"pinang\" with bikini?you can see the smooth\
  \ white skin.Such a pleasure.\n\nhopes soon can be there again"
