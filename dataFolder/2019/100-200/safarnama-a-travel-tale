Text: "I\u2019m an Indian woman raised in a conservative environment. It was really\
  \ difficult to convince my parents to let me go for solo travel. So, for my first\
  \ solo trip, I didn\u2019t inform them that I\u2019m going solo and I went! I went\
  \ to Goa without bookings, just my backpack and me. I travelled the state on a scooter.\
  \ Met locals, lived with some unknown people from other city for some days. That\
  \ experience healed me. I made new friends, somewhere something just changed in\
  \ me, felt a ray of hope in my life. After that my travel endeavours didn\u2019\
  t stop, I kept travelling for months with different groups. Travel worked as a breath\
  \ of fresh air."
