Text: 'Once upon a time in Budapest, a guy with his guitar was on a musical journey
  of his life. It was the first time he went away from his own nation "India". He
  saw an another world far away from his own country, where he saw people living their
  life with full of joy reather just being struggling in their life as happens in
  India. Infact He found an another person living inside his own body who wants to
  live like them. He started singing on the streets as he wanted and wrote a lot of
  lovely songs composed by himself and became a Rockstar. He established very strong
  bond with the people of Budapest from his song''s, a lot of people find themselves
  in his song''s. He was loved by the people of Budapest and now he is also living
  in Budapest just because that city helped him to find a new version of him within
  himself.
