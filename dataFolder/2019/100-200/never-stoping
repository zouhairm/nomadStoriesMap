Text: 'Good long time back I was travelling my two best mates to goa from dehradun.

  It was unplanned we have actually decided just a day before that we are going to
  goa tommorrow next day morning we woke up at 6 went to the stations and bought emergency
  tickets and our journey begins it was very tiering and intresting we had almost
  covered most part of the country in that 1 journey it took 3 days to reach and when
  we reached goa as expected it was uplanned so we have to suffer we didn''t get a
  hotel to stay and then finally after searching for 2 hours we found 1 smally guest
  house which just about ok to cover our heads for one day and then next morning everything
  fall on place we had got good one week.'
