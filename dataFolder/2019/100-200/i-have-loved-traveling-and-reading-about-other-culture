Text: "I selected this title in order to study&. Search I want to deeply understand\
  \ and study the routes to instability when it comes to security, economics, culture\
  \ and unity among the people. Since there is one peace in Afghanistan, therefore,\
  \ a large number of afghans migrated to different countries around the world, specifically\
  \ in Europe same of them lost their father, mother, brother, san, wife and etc.\
  \ Even it was not specified where their dead bodies buried. This is clear for all\
  \ countries around the world that there is no peace in Afghanistan. It is the main\
  \ problem that people migrate to other countries. When there is peace, security,\
  \ employment opportunity, there is no cases of stealing, murdering and violence.\
  \ As there is no peace in Afghanistan, the problems are increasing every day. Most\
  \ of youths and kids has lost their hopes for a better Afghanistan because there\
  \ are suicide attacks, killing and etc. it effects people moral. The main problem\
  \ in this country is peace which hasn\u2019t been fulfilled.  Afghanistan neighbor\
  \ country can help Afghanistan in order to achieve peace."
