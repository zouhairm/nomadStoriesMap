Text: "I\u2019m from Nicaragua, as you know nica is not going through a good time,\
  \ I came to europe (spain to be more accurate) to start my studies where I left\
  \ them in my country. The biggest reason why I left my country was because of the\
  \ constant threats of the government towards my person to prohibit my freedom for\
  \ the protests made by the majority of the citizens for an evident dictatorship.\
  \ This is only an escape from the reality that I left behind, which I want to take\
  \ full advantage of in the future to apply it to build a country that we all know\
  \ and we fear will be destroyed by everything that has already happened"
