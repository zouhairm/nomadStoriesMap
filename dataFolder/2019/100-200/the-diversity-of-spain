Text: "I am back from a 15 day trip to Spain that ended in November.  I was enticed\
  \ by the architecture of the Basilica de la Sagrada Familia and sought a tour that\
  \ incorporated Barcelona, Gaudi and modernist architecture and some major cities\
  \ of interest that displayed diversity in Spain.   Even within the Catalan region,\
  \ Barcelona, Sitges and Montserrat were so different from one another.  Andalusia\
  \ brought Granada, Ronda, Sevilla into focus and gave me an understanding of historical\
  \ rule that lingers today.  Madrid, ended my trip and gave me great confidence that\
  \ my pre-trip research paid off with such a fantastic modern capital.   Like many,\
  \ I want to interact with residents of the places I visit and feel I\u2019ve gotten\
  \ to know and enjoy an \u201Cinside track\u201D.  I was not disappointed in my first\
  \ visit to Spain and it has sparked a serious intrigue to go back and spend more\
  \ time re-visiting some of those places and finding new ones too.  Architecture,\
  \ religion, history, food, and cultural differences make for happiness in travel\
  \ and Spain was all of those."
