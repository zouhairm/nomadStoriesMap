Text: "The first day that I left for my Erasmus, I wasn\u2019t expecting nothing.\
  \ I was trying to accomplish my goals, finish my exams and perusing my objectives.\
  \ Without looking around.\nThen, some people and Coimbra\u2019s air made me open\
  \ my eyes. I wasn\u2019t no more a young adolescent girl, I was becoming a strong\
  \ woman with all the possibilities and the abilities to survive in a foreign country.\
  \ \nI booked flight, bought train ticket, walked trough the forest and the parties.\
  \ I discovered a new life, a new me and a new kind of way of living the life. I\
  \ was approaching to the adulthood in a new and strong way, entering in a new society,\
  \ in a new social texture: able to connect with people, with places and towns. Getting\
  \ lost in a new city was not a problem anymore, being without connection 4G, Instagram\
  \ or facebook was nothing. Being with the people, clapping the hands at fairs, eating\
  \ food and taking with unknown. The best reason tha I could get, is something that\
  \ I wasn\u2019t waiting for. New eyes and new heart."
