Text: "Having lived in my home town where I knew everyone as my family and previous\
  \ generations had grew up and lived there, I felt I needed to step out my comfort\
  \ zone. \nSo I decided I would go to Kenya and volunteer with a programme called\
  \ Ballon Ventures for buisness development .   I left on my 25th birthday and those\
  \ 3 months I spent there changed my life. It was the unexpected but in so many positive\
  \ ways. I can happily say a simple life is muh easier...buckets of cold water for\
  \ showers, watching the sunrise as I ran up the step hills of Kericho and the children\
  \ every evening on my way home always mafe me smile. \n\nComing home was hard to\
  \ back into the fast pace of english life but I decided to continue away from home\
  \ and beome a fundraiser for Charities. \n\nThis is only a short part of my life\
  \ but the part what made me see the world differently."
