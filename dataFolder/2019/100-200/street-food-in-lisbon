Text: "Lisbon\u2019s culinary scene is full of history and influenced by so many different\
  \ cultures that have left their traces throughout the centuries. Portuguese food\
  \ is well known and is often a reference in the culinary world, especially some\
  \ typical preparations. However Lisbon\u2019s street food is not something we often\
  \ hear about. The idea is to identify some of the most iconic street food preparations\
  \ by traveling around the city, from markets to trendy neighbourhoods to find what\u2019\
  s there! I\u2019d like to write about historical facts behind some of this street\
  \ food. I\u2019ll be giving tasting notes and taking pictures as well to go along\
  \ with it."
