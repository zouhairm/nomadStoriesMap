Text: "Here I am. Milena, 24, Argentina.\nBoth of my grandpa came from europe becouse\
  \ of war. Both of them has died recently.\nI growed up listening stories that i\
  \ need live. Flowers that i need to touch, places where i have to walk, laugh, love;\
  \ mountains i need to compare with another from my country. Fruits wich size i have\
  \ to comprobe. Are them really so big? \nWell, there are Lot of people who i didnt\
  \ met so i want to Connect. What about that history that i listened 800 times? Are\
  \ they so amazing? What about that part of the story that have never been listened?\
  \ \nWhat about all that secret places that my grandpa never told me? I'll be walking\
  \ trough roads that he had run?\nWhat about his first love? What about that church\
  \ where he prayed to be blessed?\nI'll find his child dreams? I'll ride his horse?\n\
  Just want to live. \nWant to breath that smell he loved. Or hated . Want to live\
  \ what he lived. What made him to be him. What made the man who made another man\
  \ yo bring me to life."
