Text: Actually i went at jaisalmer,india for trekking in January 2019 , first i planned
  for solo trip but then 6 of the friends were ready for that trip for 6 days,  we
  done very volunteer type work, lots of fun and many other things. Then also i gone
  for lonavala. India for solo trip. I'm always excited for traveling because by traveling
  you know many people and also find new friends and that what I want to do...  I
  want to tell more but i know I'll share my whole life story in face to face... Thanking
  you -sunny tank
