Text: "I've always wanted to witness sunset meeting the horizon of an ocean, \n\n\
  It was February 2018 one week before our college so me and my other two friends\
  \ decided to go visit gawadar , a small peninsula sharing shores with indian Indian\
  \ Ocean, gawadar is well known for its golden beaches and deep harbor, we planned\
  \ to see every beach in gawadar but only could see two. There were so many places\
  \ to go but not enough time.\n\nAfter a 4 four journey and reaching at our destination\
  \ we rested a while and decided to go see the sunset before we'd miss it, i have\
  \ never expected to find it so beautifully relaxing and peaceful at the shore of\
  \ a calm ocean, we were only three at the no one else it was a life time experience,i\
  \ could literally think nothing my mind went blankly at peace and i was just staring\
  \ at the sun setting hiding behind the vast ocean , because where i grew up there's\
  \ not any beach except dry and never ending barren fields, it was my first time\
  \ to witness a sunset from a beach and i never expected to find it so beautiful\
  \ and peaceful."
