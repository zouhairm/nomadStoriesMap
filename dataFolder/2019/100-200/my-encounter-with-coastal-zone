Text: Till l experienced the coastal part of India for me local Mumbai beach were
  only known and they never excited me. But when my better half took me to his village
  more than a decade back, I was astonished, surprised and amazed at the same time
  with the beauty my eyes were seeing. That time i understood what serene beach look
  like. The clear water, clean beach , white sand, greenery covered all around. I
  could sit for hours and can keep hearing the voice ocean has to share. Till date
  I make it a point to visit the place at least twice a year. I like to end my year
  their and start a new as well. The sea talks and takes away all the stress.
