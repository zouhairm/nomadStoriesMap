Text: I still don't know the old world. I really want to go there. Traveling by Google
  Maps is getting tiring, because I don't find the city air, the smell of the fruit,
  I do not feel my feet treading the old world from the ground. So I don't expect
  to find what is already known to me. I don't expect to find the old problems of
  the world, I already know them. I don't expect to find boring people. I hope not
  find perfection, I hope to find the colors of the Portuguese places, flavors, conversations
  with passers-by. I don't expect anything, because I know I have no control of what
  I will find, but everything is possible when I set my feet on the new Portuguese
  roads.
