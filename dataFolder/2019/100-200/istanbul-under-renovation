Text: "Walking through the upper floor of Hagia Sofia, little annoyed by the fact\
  \ that half of the main hall was covered due to renovation and thinking how to take\
  \ photograph so that I can avoid the covered part. I just peeked outside from a\
  \ small open window and was greeted by an amazing view of multiple blue color domes\
  \ , which definitely lightened my mood and also gave me a perfect frame for a picture.\
  \ \nJanuary is definitely off tourist season for Istanbul Turkey, as almost all\
  \ the attractions were under maintenance especially the blue mosque which was almost\
  \ 80% covered behind construction elements. This means I never got to experience\
  \ their beauty and grandeur fully but still whatever I got was enough to satisfy\
  \ and impress the little traveler in me. \nIstanbul just like it's people is effortlessly\
  \ beautiful and has a perfect mix of centuries old history and today's modernity.\
  \ A perfect 21st century public tram system going through 6th century byzantine\
  \ landscape creates a one of it's kind world.\nOne must visit this ancient capital\
  \ of three huge empires Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman ."
