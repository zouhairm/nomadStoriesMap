Text: "The tiny island of Maurituis in the Indian Ocean has lots of grand hotels along\
  \ its coastline but the real Maurituis is not just about the light blue luke warm\
  \ water of the beaches but inland. The story of the tea plantations will inspire\
  \ you but it is the sugarcane fields that will move your heart. Rum is one of the\
  \ main exports and thus the sugarcane plantations holds the secrets of the history.\
  \ One can feel the the spirits of the slaves and the emotions of the ocean by getting\
  \ lost in the sugaryfields. Before you know it you have traveled through time and\
  \ your back to the present. \n\nSweet like sugar so is the cane of Maurituis."
