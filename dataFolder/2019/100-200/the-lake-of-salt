  \ stuffs and make some really good connections. \nSo here starts my story, On one\
  \ fine morning I decided  escape into the very well known and one of Asia's largest\
  \ salt water lake \"Chilika\". There I got to gaze dolphins which usually comes\
  \ in winters and then I headed to a lonely Island.\nIt was hard to find anyone cook\
  \ for you there but That's how I created some contacts and then got to taste the\
  \ obviously delicious and mouth savouring local dish of prawns known as 'chingri'.\n\
  So, you never know how life and time twists and how you meet new people but you\
  \ should always be open to experience the best you can out of any place."
