Text: "I was 10 my mum and I were on a trip of a lifetime we had been to New Zealand\
  \ and England on this trip and met family but our time in America was the best thing\
  \ we could have we met cousins we didn\u2019t know we had we met my grandmothers\
  \ sister we hadn\u2019t met meeting second cousins and just spending time with them\
  \ and doing all things touristy like going to disneyworld and universal studios\
  \ to celebrating 4th of July in a town that was in the middle of independence wars\
  \ to celebrating Halloween as a friendly witch with family and friends made I will\
  \ always remember my time away though we lost my great aunt a couple of years ago"
