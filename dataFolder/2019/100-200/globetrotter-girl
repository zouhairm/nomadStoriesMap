Text: "Thailand holds a special place in our hearts. The Land of Smiles was the first\
  \ place we ever travelled internationally and the country that inspired us to quit\
  \ our lives in India to travel the world indefinitely. We explored the jungles and\
  \ mountains in the north, sun-soaked southern islands and bustling cities. We\u2019\
  ve lived in India as digital nomads and travelled the country as backpackers. Here\
  \ is the travel stories and experiences from Thailand.\nTravelers visiting Southeast\
  \ Asia have a long and complex history to unravel on their trip. The countries of\
  \ China, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos are not only neighbors, but culturally\
  \ and politically mixed throughout the centuries. The history of Thailand is long,\
  \ earliest inhabitants dating back to 3,000 BC. The history pressing on the current\
  \ Kingdom of Thailand, however, dates back to about the 13th century. In the 13th\
  \ century, modern-day Thailand established sovereignty from the Khmer Empire, the\
  \ culture of which is still present in modern-day Cambodia. Over the next few centuries,\
  \ Thailand would see the rise and fall of several Kingdoms\u2014the remains of this\
  \ history is still in evidence\u2014including the Kingdoms of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya."
