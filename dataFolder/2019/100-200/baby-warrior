  Taking a leap in to the unknown is literally buckling up and diving in or flying
  high. You never know, perhaps you will glide and the journey will be smooth, the
  wind will support you the weather will support you. The universe will support you.
  You will have others that will stand beside you, some will hug you, some will love
  you and some will may even drop you. (Don''t worry about them, they are on another
  path now) . If your core is strong enough or perhaps your wings are wide enough
  of course there''s always a chance you will reach your destination. It goes without
  saying, Everyone''s life journey is their own. Their story is always one of total
  uniqueness and their heart, their efforts, their struggles their triumphs, and life
  purpose is too of course is their own.  What do I want from life I ask myself? I
  want the same as you. To be happy, to have peace of mind. To live my life with integrity
  and passion... And of course... To fly. :) xxx'
