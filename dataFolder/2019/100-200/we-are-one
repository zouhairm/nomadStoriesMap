Text: My first abroad travel is to south Korea, i did solo traveling, when i was arrived
  on south Korea i just strightly try my first Korean food industry Seoul. Before
  Made a trip to Seoul, i already prepare for have a Korean language course, i love
  for having a communicator with Korean poeple, sharing my country's culture, food
  and also tell them the mist visited place when they go to Indonesia. I also teach
  some of them Indonesia language. Just like family. My trip just for 7 daya but i
  feels happy and feels like home in Seoul. I really love to having a trip to other
  country. To share laught, love and care with others.
