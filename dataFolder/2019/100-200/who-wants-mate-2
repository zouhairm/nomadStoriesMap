Text: 'They are us, sit in our camping and think what we can do about the food. We
  went to Fitz Roy, all day walking with the backpacking and in the end of the day,
  we dont have more food. Its 17 pm when one big question in the air is done: who
  wants mate?

  We run until the other side of the camping to share a little bit with this guy,
  who open a big smile when we arrive. Lion was his name. He is from Israel. We have
  a conversation about do hickhiking, stay in camping and be free to live months like
  backpackers. He give food, mate, nice vibes and call another spain friend too join
  with us. At that point, we have new friends, comfort food and happinees. This is
  the big thing around the mate in argentina. The feeling of share.'
