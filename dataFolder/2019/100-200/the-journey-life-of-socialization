Text: "This trip happened in 2014 where I need to visit several provinces in Indonesia\
  \ to give financial socialization on the micro insurance for villagers. \nFrom the\
  \ big city to the remote areas, from West to the East, tight schedule and catching\
  \ the flights with one purpose that people can open their mind and accept the government\
  \ programme. Me and my team need to done the socialization by 1,5 month only for\
  \ 12 provinces.\nThis journey is part of my life experiences that absolutely will\
  \ never forget, the rejection, the warmth welcome, the obstacles to the location,\
  \ the preparation, the daily report, the stuff and many things that this journey\
  \ super memorable for me. \nAnd this journey is the start in my life that I want\
  \ to explore more and see more what kind of world outside there."
