Text: There i put down my feet at the first time. Some streotypes rose in my mind
  namely rude,conflict,dirty,war and violonces. In fact it was not what i was thingking
  about.Why? I had been there as if i were being in swisterzealand or finland.Guess
  what? Yeah   Manali and Kashmir are the most beautiful place ever in the south Asia.
  Some people have known that it was located in India and some part of the land in
  Pakistan. The reality it was safe and confortable spot. There were alot things we
  can learn especially in history tourism. The city covered by the snow and also mountain
  and local wisdom. Not only that. But Manali and kashmir are place where muslim and
  hindu live. Original spices, quality souvenirs. It is too difficult to describe
  Manali and Kashmir by words. Manali and kashmir are the swisterzealand In india..Just
  come and feel the vibe. IT is one of the the place for film shooting spot of MAHA
  BOLLYWOOD.
