Text: "There I was. In Shanghai. In China\n For real. A backpacker visiting a house\
  \ transformed into a beautiful museum. I had just discovered there was a magnificent\
  \ terrace perched on the Grand Canal. I completely fell in love with the place.\
  \ The colors, the sparkling water, the calm of this hidden gem, a real happy place.\n\
  \nI wanted to immortalize this singular moment.\n\nSo I took it out, for the first\
  \ time, this mystery object that everyone was talking about, this thing that is\
  \ supposed to be an essential because it takes your pictures to the next level.\
  \ I had finally given in and purchased a selfie stick.\n\nI was shy to use it, a\
  \ bit of a rookie technology.\n\nSo I waited to be alone. I deployed it and put\
  \ my phone on it like it should have been. But it was not. Unfortunately.\n\nIt\
  \ fell apart and it was not supposed to.\n\nMy phone dropped on the floor and it\
  \ was not supposed to.\n\nIt slid and went directly underneath the small opening\
  \ of the fence. And it was not supposed to.\n\nSo there I was  In shanghai  For\
  \ real."
