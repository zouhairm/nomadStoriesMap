Text: "My love story began in Bali... We met there ...and I'm in France now.. Sounds\
  \ crazy for many people, but it is what it is. Paris,.. \nMixed feelings. It was\
  \ a cold rainy day when I arrived,  grey sky and lightly touch of sadness on people's\
  \ faces, maybe it's an effect of big city life, or just me noticing this after sunny\
  \ and free Bali island, but I remember my feelings and emotions... So different\
  \ but so beautiful and stunning city! \nMixed of sounds, smell and people make this\
  \ city unique, multicultural I would like to say.  You can find whatever your soul\
  \ desires, one of the best restorantes for foody,  one of the best cultural experience\
  \ for one who searching for a beauty of country history, smell of fashion is in\
  \ the air,  you see it you feel it.. \nCoffee and fresh croissants it's another\
  \ story,  there is a class in every croissant... This French touch which you feel\
  \ with every bite,  you can't  forget it.... Never\nCozy tiny streets you just don't\
  \ say no, for long daily walk... \nThis city touched my soul, I will go back for\
  \ sure... For summer!"
