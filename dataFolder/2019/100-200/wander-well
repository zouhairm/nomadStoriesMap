Text: "Every train, every sign, all the corners, ally\u2019s, meet-cute and ramen\
  \ slurp, I found so much to fill any prick of ready-to-fill part in me. \nMy senses\
  \ were immersed and replenished by all Japan offered to me. \nOne rememberance told\
  \ to you... \nWalking through a crowded street in busy Tokyo to a Bar I had been\
  \ advised to visit, by past travelers. I stepped up 3 flights of hanging stairs\
  \ outside a tall, thin building, wandered eyes-wide I night light down a dark corridor\
  \ to a little black door. A few knocks and I was in... the smallest, most friendly\
  \ Japanese sake and mulled wine bar. Bar tender offers me a seat, a glass and what\
  \ I may like to taste- he asks for my pallet as to pour me a perfect cocktail. Such\
  \ service, such elegance... yet a seriously casual and cool feel in the place. \n\
  I spent hours here, and came back before leaving Japan to farewell my new found\
  \ friends, also thanking them for the experience they gave to me."
