Text: I've always been one to take any opportunity for adventure. Travel has always
  been something I've wanted as a full time job. I never thought I'd be presented
  with the opportunity to move my entire life to Costa Rica. So many questions ran
  through my head. All the what ifs. All the potential failures. Just pure fear. I
  had to take a step back and remind myself who I truly am. I am that person who preaches
  to live in the moment. That person that pushes others to do what they have always
  dreamed of doing, no matter what. So I had to get real with myself, and remind myself
  who I am. So I jumped all in. That was 5 months ago. Am I happy? The happiest I
  have ever been. Was I scared? Terrified, but not sure what I was terrified of. Now
  that I am here, all that worrying was useless. It was not always easy, it still
  isn't always easy, but I have made my life what I have always wanted it to be. A
  true leap into the unknown.
