Text: Travelling for me is a journey to find my self. I've been travelling to an Island
  in Indonesia. That island is Rote. To get there I have to sail with ferry from Kupang-NTT
  and it took 4 hours to get there. Along the way I was so pleased to see the people
  and the nature with its own beauty. It drove me to realise that life is unique.
  Every person have different story, I can't just judge someone by the look but I
  have to see another things. Rote is a beautiful island and have beautiful beaches
  and beautiful and kind people.
