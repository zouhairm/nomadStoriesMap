Text: Incredible India, the tagline itself reveals the beauty this place can posses.
  The country is not only famous for it's geographic or historic beauty but beauty
  in India is all diversified. Many different cultures, religions and ethics come
  along to form one nation. Culture over here might have chosen a particular colour
  but the colour of patriotism still remains tricoloured.  Ethics might vary from
  state to state but conclusion from the ethics are brotherhood and unity. Though
  divided into many states, this country still belives in orignality and secularity.
  In this country languages might differ, intensions cannot. The place holds a great
  history in the records of time. Time changed but the history created is still inspiring
  the new generations. The motivation and inspiration Indians receive from their ancestors
  is something i didn't expect to see. They consider them as their gods and worship
  them. India is incredible!
