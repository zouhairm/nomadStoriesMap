Text: 'I have been to a lot of places and in every single one I come back home different,
  more mature and with new ideias for my life. If there is something that I can not
  live without is traveling! In december of 2018, I went with my family to Orlando
  and of course, to Disney/ Universal Orlando. As it was my first time away from my
  country, I was a little bit nervous and afread of not understanding the locals.

  Thank God I didn''t had any trouble with that! It was so freaking amazing, I felt
  like I had discovered a new world and felt in love with meeting new people.

  This experience made me determined to apply to Disney''s College Program, where
  I will be able to have that kind of contact and help people around the world to
  have the same experience that I had; Discovering new passions!'
