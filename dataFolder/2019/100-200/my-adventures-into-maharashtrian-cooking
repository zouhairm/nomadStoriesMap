Text: "It was July and the second week into my marriage. I was literally pushed into\
  \ the kitchen. I was standing behind my very brave and adventurous mother-in-law.\
  \ My hands were shaking, my palms all sweaty and all I was thinking was, now I am\
  \ going to make a mistake.\n\nThe heat in the kitchen was extreme and sweat was\
  \ tingling and dripping down my spine. \"You don't know how to cut onions.\" A shrill\
  \ voice resounded my ears. This voice could ensure that a whole neighborhood could\
  \ hear. \n\n\"Now listen first you put curry leaves, mustard seeds,\" which spluttered\
  \ on me. \"Ouch!\" She said, \"it is ok you will learn, now add what do call it\
  \ tumeric, what do you call this TUMERIC.\"\n\nThe cooking lesson was brief and\
  \ abrupt, all my mind was on was to win her heart. The moment salt and sugar married\
  \ into the dish, I knew I had won her heart.\n\nMy husband ate the dish, and he\
  \ praised me, this dish was called Poha. I now know how to make this dish. \n\n\
  I travelled into the unknown, from a different culture and married into another."
