Text: I was aspiring travel dreamer and want to explore the world and discover the
  different culture, food, belief etc. In my first travel abroad in Dubai, United
  Arab Emirates, i felt like, its my dream life to travel everywhere, i didnt miss
  a chance to visit all 7/seven states of United Arab Emirates which really fun, amazing
  and exciting place travel and i discover about the culture, everytime i visit a
  new place i feel happy that i visit a new place again. Even it is different kind
  of travel, like visit by an exit for an employment in Iran or by exit on renew of
  visa in oman, bahrain but still i enjoyed it and wishing to have real travel in
  any places that i can explore a lot of things in the world. I am looking forward
  this year to have a new breathtaking travel in any country and have a big smile
  in my face that finally i have new experience and i know in myself that this was
  make me really happy.
