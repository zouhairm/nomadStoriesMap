Text: The rocky landscapes, hurt the soles worn out from so much walking.Horizontes
  and mountains are blurred as if they began to fade with the passage of the hours.Sed
  of water, to drink and admire that mirror that pierces the current.I walk on the
  edge of the route 11 and everything seems fine. I tie my hair, the laces and I continue
  to travel. The colors I can see how they change and mix like random brushstrokes
  perfectly slid. Something clarito wet my feet and splashes all around. I found the
  waterfalls, imposing and sublime as anyone could imagine. Even a little more. I
  undress and sink into its waters as beautiful as mysterious. They shake me, they
  take me, I let myself go, I embrace the stones when I feel fear. I leave and nothing
  is the same, I dress again as if nothing happened but a peace floods me, as intense
  as calm. small stones, red earth and sweat, but nothing manages to blur the landscape.
