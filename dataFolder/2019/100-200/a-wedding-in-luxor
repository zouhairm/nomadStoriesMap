Text: I have an interesting story about a trip to attend my cousin's wedding in Luxor.
  I am originally from the capital (Cairo). We certainly know this famous city, but
  I want to talk about the pre-wedding ceremony, called the henna. I was trying to
  wear their white clothes and black clothes in the evening because we were very cold
  because we were in December but the day was too hot. While I was trying to look
  Like them they knew me right away through my accent and language The body and my
  eyes were very embarrassing, but the atmosphere was very beautiful despite its extreme
  variation and perhaps this is what distinguishes the city. This day is originally
  reserved for women to draw the henna on their hands as a kind of adornment, but
  recently men have a role in this day, men go to talk and eat and there is a good
  habit there that men give the family of the bride money as a kind of congratulations.
