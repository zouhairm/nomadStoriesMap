Text: "I was born into a poor but loving family. Internet wasn\u2019t available yet\
  \ but black and white TV was. I remember walking with my grandma holding my hand\
  \ on the way to the local market where we worked stocking tables with vegetables.\
  \ On the way home we would meet people and join them to watch a movie on TV viewing\
  \ it through the window of a department store. I always enjoyed seeing the people,\
  \ their culture, their food in the movies and dreaming of  what it would be like\
  \ to live there. I remember being amazed by the Great Wall Of China and how it was\
  \ built one block at a time and the people that built it. Sadly, the people were\
  \ always very, very poor, living in straw huts  in the middle of rice fields. In\
  \ 2008 I had the opportunity to visit The Great Wall Of China, and was absolutely\
  \ overwhelmed by its architecturally engineered beauty. I traveled in China, and\
  \ was hard pressed to find rice fields and people living in straw huts, amongst\
  \ the skyscrapers and the ultra modern cities. Pleasantly, not what I had read or\
  \ had remembered seeing  in the movies."
