Text: 'It was not a trip that I had planned all my life, far from it; it was rather
  an unknown territory. But that is one of the points that ike the most about traveling:
  meeting the unknown, while finding oneself in the unknown. The doors that open in
  front of you to discover new places, new lives and new experiences are dazzling.

  In this trip, the doors are located towards the east, in the countries of the former
  Yugoslavia, countries characterized by pain and war, but also by the hospitality
  and warmth of its people;  countries of different cultures, religions and thoughts,
  but with a common history.

  The countries we will travel through are Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro,
  Kosovo, Macedonia, Greece and Albania.

  We are going to walk through its mountains, to live in its cities and enjoy its
  coasts; all in a road trip that will last three weeks. We will have moments of astonishment
  and excitement for the new, of lines in the different frontiers, of linguistic incomprehension,
  of alimentary joy, but, above all, of discovering the unknown.'
