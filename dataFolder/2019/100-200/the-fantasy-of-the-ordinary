Text: The magical connection between a foreign traveler and a fantastic journey along
  Californian places during the summer. Visiting iconic places in LA but enjoying
  the most the simple details of life in one of the busiest cities in the world. Street
  art, multiculturalism, eclectic food and variety of music provide a magical touch
  in a concrete jungle where the marvelous happens in the eye of the ordinary. Rediscovering
  my own soul in every step, every look, every sound and every person around me with
  the classics on my thoughts and the music on my ears while walked up and down the
  Hollywood boulevard an ordinary afternoon, looking the sun trying to hide from the
  city behind the mountains feeling that amazing weather touching my skin. I was wondering
  what was real and what was fantasy. The true is you can find yourself in a lost
  old city like LA loosing your senses on details, simplicity and genuity rebuilding
  them in a completely different way changing everything forever.
