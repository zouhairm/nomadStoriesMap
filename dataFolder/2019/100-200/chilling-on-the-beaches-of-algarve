Text: "It's September and I am chilling on a beach in Algarve which is a leap into\
  \ the unknown for me. There is a ton of Portuguese history from where I originate\
  \ from in Goa, India and so I would love to bring Portugal to life to my Goan brethren\
  \ who live across the world and who love to travel.\n\nA travel story needs to pique\
  \ their interest and so I will search out a local connection to extrapolate on this\
  \ brand new country I am visiting. Give them a taste of the local cuisine, the fun\
  \ times they can enjoy on the beaches of the Algarve and  a taste of the nightlife\
  \ they can look forward too.\n\nIn the day architecture buffs can explore the city\
  \ and enjoy heritage walks or heritage architecture which dot the city. To do things\
  \ is what most tourists look for and preferably inexpensive so I will look out for\
  \ those and pepper my story with them.     \n\nMy travel story is meant to excite\
  \ the travel buff reading it and urge them to take the next 'plane into Portugal."
