Text: "1 year ago I didn\u2019t expect to live this story but it was one of my best\
  \ experience of my life.\nI took my backpack and I decided going to Thailand with\
  \ my cousin, we lived together in London, and after that every year we would like\
  \ to discover new countries and cultures.\n\nWe met people from everywhere but the\
  \ most grateful was to meet Thai people, they are used to called \u201C the country\
  \ of the smile\u201D and never better said, they look like to have a smile drawn\
  \ even when they have nothing material.\n\nFor now it\u2019s my favourite country\
  \ and it will always be on my heart.\n\nThank you for give this opportunity on my\
  \ life I will never forget it"
