Text: A clear glass sits on a table over looking the ocean. Is it half full or half
  empty? We look at it as possibilities and of course a drink. Husband and I are on
  the very rare vodka diet. We look younger and thinner with each passing year and
  the views keep changing to whatever we want them to be. Life is about change, learning
  and most of all a lifetime of memories shared over vodka. We assemble ourselves
  with laughter and go forth with everyone wondering where we came from. From country
  to country we go bringing our vodka diet in tow keeping locals and tourists in awe.
  Are they real or apart of my imagination? Only the vodka knows the truth. So pour
  yourself one and experience our vodka diaries.
