Text: "Everyone in the world likes traveling to all countries around the world. I\
  \ aslo like it so much and the first country I visited is Lebanon  . The reason\
  \ of my travel was taking TOEFL Exam and I stayed in Beirut for 10 days .\nOn the\
  \ first day , I Stayed in my relative's house and I relaxed well . On the second\
  \ day, I took the exam then I focused on discovering each meter in Beirut, so I\
  \ accompanied my cousin and went to gether to loads of places . In addtion , I have\
  \ tried Dunkin Donuts for the first time and the donuts were amazing and delicious\
  \ . I aslo went to churches , mosques and historical sites. On the other days ,\
  \ I went to the beach and I made new friendships ,moreover, I visited the American\
  \ University in Beirut ( AUB ) which is very magnificent. \nOn the other hand, although\
  \ Lebanese food is the same of Syrian food , food is very tasteful.\n and delicious.\n\
  It was very interesting experience for me and I hope to travel to Portugal."
