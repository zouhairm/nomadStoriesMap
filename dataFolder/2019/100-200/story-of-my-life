Text: All my life i have dreamt of roaming and exploring, i clearly remember being
  thrown out of my house as a punishment and those were the golden moments, i'd relish
  them by thinking i was on a tour and roam around the colony, at times neighbors
  used to bring me back, lost and found case i'd become, that again was a moment when
  i refused to recognize anyone and pose as a traveler, my imagination was considered
  my innocence and a leverage of being a kid was imposed upon. Today also when i roam
  around the streets i try to look through unseen, i try to understand unfathomable,
  i try to seek solace in most crowded of places. Traveling, vagabonding, roaming,
  wandering, runs in my veins, maybe all who travel are not lost and even if they
  are, lemme tell you we often find ourselves by loosing out completely..!
