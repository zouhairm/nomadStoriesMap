Text: I never accept my travel journey will be this far away, well i live in Jakarta
  Indonesia, and i have to accross around three continents and 38 hours flight just
  to reach my dream travel bucketlist, The greatest ancient mountain MachuPicchu.
  Maybe for you will say, what so special about the journey everyone go there anyways.
  For me is a yes, im not mountain type person traveller but i love cities with hype
  embience, unique and have colours. And i met that cities on a way to MachuPicchu,
  and the cities was funtastic! That ambition which drive me there. I went there by
  myself, a city type woman who nearly 40 never hike a mountain before and never had
  solo travelling but suddenly have thought in mind, i have to do it. I think its
  the highest achievement that i got. And surely i want to share my life experience
  with you
