Text: "We are in a painted and loud city. On every corner you can see scenes from\
  \ different movies. Here artist turned on some peppy music and rhythmically painting\
  \ on the wall. A car that looks like a bug sweeping past us. There is a couple sitting\
  \ in it, they have shiny clothes and colored hair. Their own rhythms and sounds\
  \ are spreading around.\u2800\n\u2800\nCrowd carries us in a stream - does not resist.\
  \ We get on a colorful basketball court. There is a smell of fresh paint and alcohol,\
  \ strange pictures, aquarium with motley balls.\u2800\n\u2800\nSwimming forward.\
  \ See luminous trailer attracting with bright photos, neon and climbing plants.\
  \ There is another separate world. Huge noisy stage: ground trembles because of\
  \ stamping feet and musical bass. Here are flavors of food, fun, lights, endless\
  \ drawings on the walls, underfoot, on pillars and bodies \u2014 everywhere.\u2800\
  \n\u2800\nDive headlong in this fast and loud stream. Let\u2019s go to Art Basel?\u2800"
