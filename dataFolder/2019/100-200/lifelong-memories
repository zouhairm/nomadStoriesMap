Text: "Last summer, my family and I planned a trip to Tunisia for the summer vacation\
  \ there. On the first day we woke up early in the morning. Everyone was happy with\
  \ this trip, so my younger sister did not sleep at night because she was afraid\
  \ to go and left her and she was the happiest person among us. When we arrived at\
  \ the Tunisian-Algeria border, the place was crowded with tourists flowing into\
  \ Tunisia. When it was our turn, we took measures to enter Tunisia like a passport\n\
  \ \nThen we entered Tunisia and we went to our house facing the sea and the atmosphere\
  \ was very active and lively. All the people were happy  . We saw the museums, the\
  \ amusement park and the horsemen as we swam in the sea and the taste Traditional\
  \ Tunisian dishes .   we visited   a tourist city with all its features and places.\n\
  These days are the most beautiful memories"
