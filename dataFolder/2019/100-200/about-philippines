Text: "Philippines has more than 7000 islands and a population of about 100 million\
  \ people, making it a country that would take a long time to see properly. It\u2019\
  s often defined by its beautiful natural sites but it also has a strong food scene\
  \ and many cultural offerings.\n\nThe influence of Western countries that have colonised\
  \ it over the centuries gives The Philippines a blended culture. English is the\
  \ main language while the religion is clearly Spanish in origin. There is also evidence\
  \ of the Americans in much of the modern lifestyle.\n\nFilipino culture places a\
  \ strong emphasis on relationships, particularly with family and the church. While\
  \ visitors often travel to the country for the beaches or the diving, it\u2019s\
  \ hard to escape the warmth and generosity of the people. Expect to be well fed\
  \ and well looked after"
