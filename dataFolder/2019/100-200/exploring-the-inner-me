Text: 'Writing is my meditation, world is my home, roads are my companion, exploring
  is my soul.

  Traveling helps us find our inner artistic voice, after every single trip, I find
  a new me and much more groomed inner me, folks asks me why you spend so much in
  traveling? I say that is my investment, uncovering the fascinating places, sharing
  my storys to strangers, hearing their storys, eating some never tasted food, experiencing
  different cultures is what all I live for, writing gives life to my prospective
  of living, whenever I stuck in problems, I just pack my bags and travells, traveling
  makes me realize that we are just a small part of this immense world surrounding
  us, coming back to my problems doesn''t even sounds like a problem, why we give
  so much importance to ourselves? Just breathe, our world is separated by barriers,
  cultures, caste, Creed but the only thing which unites us is humanity.


  Words maybe be decorated, feelings are original.'
