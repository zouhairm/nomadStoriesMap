Text: "Me and kid went to west europe in 2017. No tour agency. Just two of us. With\
  \ limited money.\nBut rich passions of explorer.\nOur first destination is Paris.\
  \ We walking around the city because we cant afford taxi. And the street brought\
  \ me to the south. By a bus we exploring Zurich for 2 days. Straight to Millan,\
  \ venice, and Rome for a week. And a day trip to Pisa by train from Termini. Because\
  \ of Im Indonesian, i really missed rice. And finally i found Indian rice near the\
  \ train station. Thats my biggest relief. We keep walking and finally we decide\
  \ to go to Amsterdam. Meet and greet with big family. Last time we meet was at 1996.\
  \ We explore the wooden shoes maker. And take a picture with dutchess traditional\
  \ dress. All this experience was priceless. Remind me about how to breaking the\
  \ ice with the parisien. Hufff hard thing...\nAnd how charming the Italian is. And\
  \ absolutely how warm the dutchess is.\nWhat an amazing journey with my little girl.\n\
  And both of us are poor \U0001F605\nWe just follow the passion, maybe a lil bit\
  \ reckless. But it was once a life time experience. So, no regret. At all..."
