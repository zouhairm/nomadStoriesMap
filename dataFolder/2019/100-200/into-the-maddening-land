Text: 'Oh India. I cannot possibly put into words how I feel about you but I will
  give it a go: Beautiful, dazzling, dirty, noisy, congested, polluted, vivid, intense,
  rank, fascinating, inspiring, monumental, maddening and sublime. My eyes and ears
  are continuously and curiously dragged into your surreal offerings, even when I
  try and sleep. Noises everywhere. Horns bibbing, children playing, dogs barking,
  cows wailing, fireworks, music, mosques, temples and market men. Every taste of
  food is rich and the history is even richer.


  India is everything and nothing I imagined all at once. Being here is overwhelming
  and NOTHING is easy here, but something it is not, is boring.'
