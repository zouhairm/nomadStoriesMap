Text: In India whenever you talk about beaches, only one place will blink in your
  mind and i.e GOA. It's a place where every youngster wanna go. Some of with friends,
  family and some solo. I am a solo traveller so i choose a solo trip to Goa. I'm
  in love with Goa, now for me it's my second home. I travelled so many places there
  and watching sunsets at a calm beach (less rushed) is my favourite thing to do.
  If you're a person who love to be in peace and to find what your heart wants, you
  will get everything by watching the sun goes down. The sun go down but you get your
  intension of doing things you want will get high. Whenever i feel down i go the
  beach sit near the water and listen to the sound of waves, i found my soul so happy,
  fresh , full of life. By watching these kind of sunsets, i do believe that they
  are the proof that no matter what happens, every day can end beautifully.
