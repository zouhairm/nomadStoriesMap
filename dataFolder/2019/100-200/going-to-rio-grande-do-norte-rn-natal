Text: 'At my university, we always had management conferences (my course) and this
  was in Natal. There we walked a little more and met several Argentines who have
  ventures there, few people know of the existence of this group in that region, so
  I practiced a little of my Spanish, seizing the opportunity ...

  And they told me that they like Brazil and that their parents had moved here with
  the whole family and they were adapting. At the end we said goodbye and followed
  the journey.

  It may seem like a simple conversation, but it was an important step in my unlocking
  with the language conversation, scarcely they knew the inner revolution that happened
  at that moment.'
