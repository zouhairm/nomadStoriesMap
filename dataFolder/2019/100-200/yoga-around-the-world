Text: "My story begins with a want to expand and explore!  YouTube video about teaching\
  \ English abroad, a plane ticket and a month in Ho Chi Minh City is all I knew was\
  \ to happen for sure. As a yoga instructor, my plan to teach yoga was simply assumed\
  \ next to other activities, but it truly and quickly became central in my experience.\
  \ \n\nAs my month course concluded and online teaching of English now available\
  \ to me, I journeyed next to Da Nang, where I taught private yoga classes on a rooftop\
  \ yoga deck at my AirBnB! What a magical way to start and end the day in this new\
  \ city! As I walked the Dragon Bridge each day, I found my adventures to be more\
  \ of a dance, a vinyasa, than a straight, linear line.\n\nI concluded in Hoi An,\
  \ teaching at a backpacker yoga studio downtown and staying in quite fine accommodations.\
  \ Loving my bike rides through flooded streets (it was the rainy season), teaching\
  \ new styles of yoga to expats and growing personally and professionally.\n\nBack\
  \ in the States, I deeply bow to these experiences and all that occurred in Asia\
  \ for me. Shivoham!"
