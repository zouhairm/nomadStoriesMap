Text: Once upon a time there was a young boy from Zanzibar who decided he wanted to
  see the world in a colourful manner and experience all the foods, meet as many people
  and photograph beautiful women. As her grew up his grandfather gave him a camera,
  a little Diana camera. Being a smaller build child he used the camera to squeeze
  his way into meeting people, acquainting himself with women in all parts of the
  world and eating at fabulous places on this planet. Then he decided he wanted to
  travel to Europe, so he packed his camera and a change of clothes and left Calgary
  for Europe where he started his journey. Along the way he became a well published
  Fashion Photographer where he had the opportunity to visit the fabulous gorgeous
  beaches of Portugal and fell in love with this untouched beauty that was unlike
  many beaches he had visited. Therefore when this proposition came up, this young
  man decided to write in so as to complete his journey to experience Faro!
