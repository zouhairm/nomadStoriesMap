Text: Granted I became a mom at an early age, there are a lot of things about life
  that my guardians failed to tell me about. One of those things is being able to
  travel the world to explore new things. Upon settling myself down I began to think
  about the things in life that I want to do which included finishing school, living
  life to the fullest, & traveling. Granted I am graduating in the spring with my
  first degree, this would be and awesome trip to take just to be able to hit the
  reset button on life. One thing I truly love is the freedom of being able to go
  places and explore new things. If I could win this trip, it would be the start of
  something new to me as well as a refreshing and rewarding experience.
