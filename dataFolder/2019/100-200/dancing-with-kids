Text: "I had a dream to volunteer with blinknow in Nepal ever since l heard about\
  \ Maggie Doyne the founder. She had started to adopt children at age 18 and built\
  \ them a home with her babysitting money. Now 13 years later she has 52 kids, a\
  \ thriving school and women's centre. My dream came true in 2017 I had a 2 week\
  \ placement to share my creative dance with 4/5 year olds for the 2 week Dashain\
  \  camp. \nIt took a day and a half to reach there by 2  planes and a 5 hour jeep\
  \ ride to reach dusty, dry, hot Surket. We were greeted with a warm welcome and\
  \ taken to our \" best western hotel\" which really was anything but the best! But\
  \ being there with a bunch of great volunteers from around the world made it a very\
  \ special place. We felt right at home later meeting Maggie and all her children\
  \ being greeted with a Samsung evening g of dancing and singing. And that was just\
  \ the beginning. ...of what was to be a great adventure"
