Text: "I would like to write a story on the topic: landscape or the beautiful places\
  \ of Portugal, be it natural or urban, I will pay a lot of attention to details\
  \ that focus on setting. The coverage will help to illuminate the beauty of Portugal,\
  \ a country nicknamed the Venice of Portugal for its beautiful network of canals\
  \ that wind their way through the city, Aveiro is at once unique and typically charming\
  \ architecture.\nI will talk to experts and indigenes of the country, authorities\
  \ and any essential source I will access.\n\nI will write about the Venice of Portugal,\
  \ the beautiful canals, and I will find out things like: How deep is the canals?\
  \ How high is the rim? What kind of rock will we see? What plants grow there? Are\
  \ there any endemic critters? Who lived there first? Have any notable explorers\
  \ commented on the place\u2019s beauty, harshness, grandeur? How many kilometers\
  \ or miles of trails cut through it? When was it created? Why was it created? What\u2019\
  s the reward for whatever effort it takes to see it?\nMy focus will be of all the\
  \ places/things to write about, highlighting what is unique and pristine about the\
  \ Portugal landscape."
