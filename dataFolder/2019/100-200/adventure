Text: The comparison of the African countries to other European countries is what
  makes me a full person, my country Uganda was known as a land Lock county,this is

  given to Canada before Canada? Did they also colonised by any country just like
  most of the African countries were colonised by European? This is the only story
  I wanna developed, this is what I Dont like reading but I love to write my own .And
  another thing I wanna do is to compare the political history of Canada to African
  countries,
