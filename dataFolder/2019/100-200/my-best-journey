Text: 'My favourite trip is to travel from Budapest to London. I book my plane ticket
  and from there the adventure begins. In London as soon as you get off the plane
  you feel the international atmosphere. You are going to meet the latest fashion
  around the corner. I go and visit the top tourist places: Traffalgar Square, London
  Eye, Westminster Abbey, Tower Bridge, just to mention a few. Then I pick a few museums:
  Tate Modern, British Museum and I take some science lessons, like the Industrial
  Museum, Science Museum. Then I take a rest in a good pub or at a restaurant. My
  favourite places are the markets at Camden town and in Portobelo Street. London
  is so colorful that I   don''t care about the rainy weather. I would trully recommend
  to take a break and wander around the streets of London. It is so artistic, vibrant,
  nobody can be bored there.'
