Text: I've had him on my contacts list for years, I talked a couple of times, until
  now with whatsapp he found my number, and we started talking. The conversation lasted
  and until now it never ended. At some point, in the middle of I wanted to be with
  you, we fell in love. We are one more of these passionate couples, the difference
  is that we do not know each other. I've never seen him, except the Internet, but
  I do not know the smell, I do not know where he's going, but I know how his head
  works, I know the thousands of stories he has to tell me, which are mine, just for
  me. We have a meeting scheduled, so I'll be in Portugal to meet him. in August.
  And i want to tell this love history, this real history.
