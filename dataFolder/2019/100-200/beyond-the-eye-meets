Text: "Beneath the Neroberg hill, the humongous trees gave the feeling of a normal\
  \ hill forest we are about to hike up. But the moment we reached the top, Breathtaking\
  \ echoed in me - instantly. \nRhine river flowing peacefully between two beautiful\
  \ cities, Wiesbaden and Mainz. I wonder what stories were happening in those homes\
  \ while we admire the smoke  coming out from their burning chimneys.\nThe view itself\
  \ was mesmerising. We found our selves between Russian Orthodox Church - with it's\
  \ five golden domes inspired by the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow it\
  \ will take you to the Russian heritage. And there is one more special thing about\
  \ this place -  the love and grief of a husband and a father for his wife and daughter.\
  \ Duke Adolf of Nassau lost her beloved wife and daughter during childirth. He grieved\
  \ so profoundly that he decided to built a church around her grave.\nFew step away\
  \ there is a a park dotted with monuments and amenities. \nA serene scenery for\
  \ all the creative people like me who love to admire how wonders happen with the\
  \ perfect blend of nature and history."
