Text: "Traveling is all about mixing into local culture.\nI remember me dancing with\
  \ Rajasthani women in Jaisalmer. It was really fun to be in their colors of joyness.\
  \ I also enjoyed sitting on the lake side of Udaipur. I was just lost in my thoughts\
  \ seeing the new destinations. \n      Sometimes travelling is about being mute\
  \ and dive into thoughts of all the new destinations. Every location has their own\
  \ reflection of history.\nI feel it is good to go on the streets in just to try\
  \ the local things, just like you try coconut water and the rice in Bangalore. \n\
  Jaisa Desh waisa bhes is something to be believed about. After all I am a Indian\
  \ and I like to dissolve in any culture. Coming back was sleeping into the bed of\
  \ palaces in dreams."
