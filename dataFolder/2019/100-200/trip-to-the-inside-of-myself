Text: "During a four-month trip to Amsterdam, various circumstances of life led me\
  \ to have to know myself, to understand who I am, what I want, where I am going.\
  \ I knew that going there and living alone would make me connect in a different\
  \ way internally and deeply, but I never thought it would be so intense, for better\
  \ or for worse.\n\nAfter much thought, I decided to go to Amsterdam to do part of\
  \ my research on trans people and to live new experiences. It would be my first\
  \ time living abroad and also my first time living alone, without partners. \n\n\
  I had lived for 6 years with my partner, and now it was time to spend some time\
  \ apart, in the distance. I always thought that we could do anything that came our\
  \ way, that we were a strong couple and we trusted each other, what could go wrong?\n\
  \nBut in life, things always end up being difficult and obstacles appear, tests\
  \ that make you see the reality of things. So life led me to the greatest suffering\
  \ and at the same time the best experience of my life."
