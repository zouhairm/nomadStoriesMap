Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself on this journey, the rich culture, bright\
  \ colors and the diversity of people reminded me of my importance as an individual.\
  \ Traveling was always something I was scared of; but my new mantra in life from\
  \ the year 2019... is that: If it doesn\u2019t scare the hell out of you, it probably\
  \ isn\u2019t worth it! I took this journey to Portugal to experience; for the first\
  \ time in my life, a different country. And who knew I would find a home away from\
  \ home. A place where I feel welcomed and  cared for by random strangers, a place\
  \ where my difference is not a threat but an invite to cultivate new and exciting\
  \ friendships and life-long relationships. Since a little girl I have found my voice\
  \ and comfort in writing. Writing about this travel journey has made me pay more\
  \ attention to what really is; than what I just see. I am finding myself. I am finding\
  \ home by being far away from home. Because home was always wherever I would be."
