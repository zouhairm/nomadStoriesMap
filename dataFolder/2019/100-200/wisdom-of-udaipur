Text: "As I stared at the fort ,I believed  it w\xE1s me who built it.but it was because\
  \ of the heavy tripping of the chai (tea) .which  I had from front of the fort.so\
  \ now, I understand how the bhang tea trips.that moment I was inside the jal Mahal\
  \ of udaipur which is a shehar(city) of Rajasthan. It has the centuries of histories\
  \ forbidden in this adorable city.as jal Mahal is four sides surrounded by water.\
  \ it was me to do some digging.i came to know the way it was built by a king and\
  \ the Mahal is forbidden with dungeons of passage to the kings treasure. \n   I\
  \ was totally high as I checked out the place and felt like being guard of that\
  \ fort.the sunset which is the best view from the fort.and it fills the soul full\
  \ of energy and make to believe most beautiful theme ever you see is this show.\
  \ Such a lightful delight were you feel wisdom in the soul."
