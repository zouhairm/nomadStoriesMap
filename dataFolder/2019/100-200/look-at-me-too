Text: Love to take pictures of unknown places, people, exlpore their lifestyle, thoughts,
  struggles and happiness. There are many untouched places in India where people dont
  even bother to go to, they are mostly into going tp shopping malls, trying to be
  tech savvy and updated. The people in those deprived area are so innocent and staying
  near the mountains, completely cut off from the outside world where no one care
  to reach and help them out. Its wonderful to stay with them, spend some time and
  know their lives, culture, rituals. Aso teach them about the outside world and what
  they can do to make their life better.
