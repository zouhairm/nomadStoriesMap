Text: "The oldest leyend of Portugal tells us the story of Alfonso I, first King of\
  \ Portugal and how he achieve the throne by conquering the five Morous Kings, in\
  \ his time. What belic but beautiful and full of wisdom stories can these places\
  \ bring back to life through it's people? How they live?, how their own history\
  \ affects them?, what are their favourite stories?, are some of them descendents\
  \ of the most important protagonist of this leyends?.\n\nPortugal has it's own pace\
  \ in the world history, is a land of conquerors and liberators, a land that earned\
  \ the respect of Europe by never giving up, and it is full of anecdotes ready to\
  \ be heard. At first sight it might seem as a small country, but a great one once\
  \ we put a foot on it's grounds. Let's have a meal with some of it's people and\
  \ walk through the rocky road of where the most iconic battles happened. \n\nLet\
  \ me unified the past and the present; Let us connect the oldest Portugal with the\
  \ new."
