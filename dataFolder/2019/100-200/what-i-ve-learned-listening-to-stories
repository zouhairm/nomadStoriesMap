Text: "My story is based in my experience and my vision about all things I will see\
  \ during my journey. I know that my way to see things is inseparable to what is\
  \ happening, so I wanted to try to see all events with open heart. \nIt could be\
  \ amazing to show people that there are many ways to experience something, allowing\
  \ the unexpected. \nMy interest is based on people from everywhere, in everyway,\
  \ doing different things, living in different ways, I want to get to know their\
  \ stories, their dreams, how they live and be able to share, showing different ways\
  \ to build the reality. \nI expect to visit all kinds of places as possible, and\
  \ talk to people. I want to show humanity. I'd love to show it in every kind of\
  \ person perspective."
