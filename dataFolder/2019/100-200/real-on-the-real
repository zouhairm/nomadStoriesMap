Text: 'Have you heard the phrase "everything happens for a reason"? or have you heard
  that people say you are in the place you have to be when you have to be ...? Well
  ... that''s what this story is ... I travel alone to Europe to know new places and
  new people and have new experiences and I ended up really knowing the person with
  whom I have lived all my life, myself.

  My trip was purely leisure and ended up being much more.

  In one of the places where I learned more about my vulnerability, I ended up finding
  myself, knowing my best strengths and everything I am capable of.

  Realizing how good and great you are is one of the best feelings there is, knowing
  that you are a person who really is worth all your weight in gold and that you can
  achieve everything you want and more!

  This trip is one of the things that I have been most afraid to do, but it is what
  I treasure the most.

  I always appreciate having the opportunity to do this and have done it alone ...'
