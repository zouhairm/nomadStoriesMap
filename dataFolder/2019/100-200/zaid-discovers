Text: "I was born in Pakistan went to a british school.\nAfter my high school I moved\
  \ to Melbourne, Australia get my University degree in Psychology but Australia wasn\u2019\
  t the place for me. When I came back to meet my parents in Pakistan, I decided to\
  \ switch to Canada and moved there around 7 months ago.\nIt has been the best decision\
  \ I made yet.\nI love everything here. It takes courage for parents to send their\
  \ children to other countries to seek education and as I had asthma they were really\
  \ nervous of letting me go alone. However, they made up their mind and they\u2019\
  re proud of their decision too.\nI\u2019ve always loved travelling and europe has\
  \ always been a dream place. I even will try to go there in the summers for a few\
  \ days.\nBut if I get opportunity like this it will definitely broaden my horizons\
  \ and will try to be a good learner.\n\nPlease consider me it\u2019ll be a dream\
  \ come true."
