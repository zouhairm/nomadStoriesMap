Text: 'I pretend to be local, everywhere I go. Because I can speak many languages
  with many dialect, local language. I can get local price, local friend, accepted
  as local. I will try local food, local travel estination wich many people don''t
  know, hidden gems.


  I like street food same as I like 5 star restaurant food. I like to talk with beggar
  in a city while I like to speak with the owner of big company also. I dig deeper,
  I go higher. I like culture, I do dance, sing, DJ, I can get along with so many
  kinds of people.


  Many of the time I don''t tell who really I am and just pretend to be nobody. From
  theew I can see people''s heart. I''ve been to Yogya, Jakarta, Batam, Bali, Surabaya,
  etc and I am proud of it. Many things are different.



  Many times people look down on me. How I get molested with local guy who almost
  raped me. I take carr my own. I can do karate, jeet kune do, I learn. I like to
  travel. Settle down is boring.'
