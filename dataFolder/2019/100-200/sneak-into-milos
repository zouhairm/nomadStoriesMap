Text: "I flew to see a friend in London and he graciously offered his holiday house\
  \ on Milos, a small Greek Island.\nSo I immediately said I would love to go.\n\n\
  I flew to Athens for a day and AirB our first night. A small Greek apartment for\
  \ 30 Euros. We arrived at 4am to be picked up by the a Hungarian man and his daughter.\
  \ We arrived and where shown to the roof top, I looked up and I was blown away as\
  \ the Acropolous was there in all its magnificence. My friend and I sat in awe whilst\
  \ listening to the Athens church bells begin their daily ring, on started then another,\
  \ this was the beginning of a trip that would take me to Ancient Greece, stand in\
  \ the place where the Benus De Milos once stood, dribble the streets of Milos, watch\
  \ stunning sunsets from restaurants on a cliffs edge, laugh with local Greeks and\
  \ live in my friends AMAZING Klimt Beach house got two glorious weeks of sun, beaches,\
  \ Greek food and don\u2019t get me started in the yachting. Beautiful seas and magnificent\
  \ volcanic  swimming vistas with Norwegian Vikings on the other yacht. A holiday\
  \ never to forget."
