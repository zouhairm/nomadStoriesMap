Text: "In 2015 i had to move to La Habana, Cuba. I lived there for 2 years and it\
  \ was amazing. I had to learn spanish and did a lot of things that i had never thought\
  \ i would be able to do. \nI have traveled to most cities in the south east asia\
  \ and when i landed first time there i was so clueless. I have no idea that La Habana\
  \ was so classic and seemed stuck in time. Everything there was so classic and fascinating\
  \ how habaneiros lived their lives in such limitation. \nAnd now i am humbly called\
  \ La Habana home bc i actually made connection with my neighbours and Habaneiros\
  \ who helped me during my time there."
