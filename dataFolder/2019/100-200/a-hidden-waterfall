Text: It was a glorious morning in Telangana, Khammam so we decided to rent bikes
  to cycle to a waterfall.we headed out of town and turned off the main road onto
  an impossible steep mud track, following signs to the waterfall.we fine tuned past
  tiny houses with farmers cropping land besides the forest.we heard the thundering
  sound of water falling down a sheer drop,and a beautiful waterfall cutting through
  the tick vegetation came into view.we hide our bikes in some bushes,took off shoes
  and climbed as far as we could up the rocks at the side of the waterfall.l love
  getting off the beaten path and the views across the valley in the bright evening
  sun were breath taking
