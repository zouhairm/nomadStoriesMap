Text: 'Arriving in a country you''ve never been in to start a walk that scares you.
  Its a pilgrimage through Portugal to Santiago de Compostela. On the Camino, all
  roads lead to one glorious final destination, the burial location of St. James the
  Apostle. With only a backpack and a guidebook we head out on a paved road that slowly
  turns into a cobblestone road and final a dirt path surrounded by fields, farms
  and cathedrals.


  From one town to the next we meet strangers who become friends, learn about ourselves
  and find our way on the The Way. Six women travelling together to make this pilgrimage
  over 250 km the story practically tells itself, the fun, the tears the hurt feet
  are all sure to be a story that unfolds over 14 days.


  Not just another guide but a true story of how we travelled from Canada to Portugal
  and finished in Spain.'
