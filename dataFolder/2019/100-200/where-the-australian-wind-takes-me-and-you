Text: "If I could photograph the smell. Trees are flowering. Big sanddunes. No, they\
  \ are huge. The dirt. And green. The yellow surroundings. \n\n Horizons, far away.\
  \ But really far away. Dirtroads with animal skeletons. For company. Feeling the\
  \ salty air. While I am breathing. Swinging clouds. Low in the sky.\n\n Curling\
  \ hair. The wind. And flies. Many flies. Swallowed one too. Romantic shapes in the\
  \ sand. Creative snakes. Roo's in the light of dawn. Pink and purple skies. Sunsets.\
  \ This bowl of fire.\n\n Waves loving, crashing. Beaches. Oo, the beaches. Healing\
  \ in every sea. Feeling the currents. White shells for decoration. Dolphins in the\
  \ ocean. One threw a fish. \nAt my feet. I started dancing. This mer'man' on the\
  \ rocks. \n\n Remote. Isolated. Nature is the language. Untouched and wild. Can\
  \ you hear it? The quiet. This colourful island. This big island. The West Coast.\
  \ Home. A leap into the unknown. For you. While I am hearing this song. Do you come\
  \ from a land.."
