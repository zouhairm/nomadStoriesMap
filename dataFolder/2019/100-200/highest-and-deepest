Text: Time doesn't stop but being in Siargao Islands of the Philippines is something
  that makes the move of your world not just "slow mo" but really "stop". Yes indeed,
  time stopped like "what?! Is it time to sleep again?!". Yo will never feel that
  time exists and move or do it's job in this place. From it's deepest, where blue
  sea explains your life in its unfathomable meaning to it's highest where clear sky
  let u see that there is something beyond any one's bare eyes can see. Yes, life
  is so short not to see many wonderful places worldwide but being in Siargao is not
  something ordinary. The extravagant explanation of what life really is, is indeed
  well delivered by the fresh air that says "I'm the air that knows no pollution"
  or the sea that says "let my waves carry you through" and the sands that says "step
  on me for I'm gentle, I'll let you feel being cuddle". What this place will give
  you is more than your expectation as I have said from its deepest to its highest,
  Siargao Islands is one of the best!
