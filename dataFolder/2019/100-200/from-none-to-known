Text: 'From none to known


  It was 1992 I was traveling to her womb with other corores of my friends. And the
  time I reached at her womb we all started fighting with each other. And finally
  I won and I entered to that space where I have to live for nine months. At starting
  i didn''t have any shape, place was so little, i just have to take water, food and
  breath, and yes I can hear and see from that ladies eye. Time passed and suddnley
  at the 7th month my whole place got empty, used to be full of water. And finally
  from none to known I horned as a very delicate, cute baby girl. My journey was not
  so easy as a prematured baby. But yes I travelled alot to become known as a human
  being. And it''s my 27th birthday I am going to Portugal to celebrate my journey.'
