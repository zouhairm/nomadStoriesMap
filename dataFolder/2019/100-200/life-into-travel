Text: There are people who will guide you with their experience before you travel
  to destination... may be their experience will be good this will help you or may
  be bad this will too help you to wander... have your own experience jump into the
  race doesn't matters play single no time limit no fear of losing start a race to
  breathe, to fly, to move, to float, to gain, to roam to loads of the land, to travel,
  get realized yourself how beautiful wandering is.. wandering is more than the seeing
  sights, occupy the place in the world. It is a chance that goes on deep and permanent
  in the ideas of living... wandering is all about tragedy, solve it by getting lost
  in the nature once you solved this tragedy, it will give you home in thousands of
  strange places...
