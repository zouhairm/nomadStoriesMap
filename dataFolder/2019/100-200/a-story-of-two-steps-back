Text: "Here I am. New York City. Manhattan. \nI wasn\u2019t sure how that would sound\
  \ after my arrival, but it sounded pretty awesome when I decided to come. \nRecently\
  \ graduated in Law, recently passed the BAR in Brazil, and from nothing, had the\
  \ crazy idea to drop everything and travel the US as an Au Pair. \nHighly criticized\
  \ by everybody, but also motivated by one of the best people in the world: my mom.\n\
  Two months here, and I decided to write it down my memories, my fears and my expectations\
  \ on a journal, so I could read when my adventure ends in one year. In the meantime,\
  \ I feel like I have so many things to discover, to learn about myself, and to correct\
  \ on my personality. \nWhen people ask why did I give two steps back on my career,\
  \ calling reckless, I have only one answer: I don\u2019t know yet, but I really\
  \ happy that I have the opportunity to find out. And when I do, I will let you know.\
  \ \nStephanie doesn\u2019t know yet what the future holds for her, but she has the\
  \ courage to find out."
