Text: 'As he says: "A leap into the unknown", we arrived from Argentina to Vancouver,
  Canada. The idea was to experience Canadian life and we got a hemrosa surprise.
  Vancouver is such an incredible city that we did not stop surprising each day. We
  were in that land for 1 year, together with my wife Daniela. Every weekend was to
  schedule an outing to their parks, lakes, beaches, mountains, and we even had the
  pleasure of going to see the famous banff with its great lakes, we were in love
  with Canada in all its aspects, culture, education, etcetera . For us Vancouver
  is the best city in the world. I love you Van

  Nick & Dani'
