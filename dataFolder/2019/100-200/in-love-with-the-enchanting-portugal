Text: "This magical and illuminated city of Lisbon was something different. The Portuguese\
  \ and stone sidewalk pavement forming various abstract patterns, the typical yellow\
  \ tram going through the city spreading its color, the Fado and the usual life with\
  \ its distinct village atmosphere,... All that impressed me in a good way, I felt\
  \ like I was in another part of the world and I just was like 300 km far from home.\
  \ \n\nThree times I have been so far in Portugal and I tell everyone who asks me\
  \ about my experiences in this country that I'll never get bored of visiting this\
  \ wonderful place."
