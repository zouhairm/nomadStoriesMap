Text: "In my history, I will travel arround Paraguay, which is the country of the\
  \ 'ind\xEDgenas', and, also called: 'La tierra de los valientes', 'La tierra de\
  \ los guaran\xEDes' discovering about all the culture, the beautiful places, and\
  \ all the history behind the most undiscoverable places of Paraguay, running thorough\
  \ the 'Ru\xEDnas Jesu\xEDticas', the gran metropolitan capital 'Asunci\xF3n', de\
  \ big 'desert' of Paraguay, most recognized by 'Chaco', and other places, making\
  \ curious comparisons between the urbanistic and amazing capital 'Asunci\xF3n',\
  \ and the unbelievable, 'Capital of the soybean', the Alto Paran\xE1 department,\
  \ in the extreme East of this beautiful country, which is invisible and unknown\
  \ by all the rest of the world!"
