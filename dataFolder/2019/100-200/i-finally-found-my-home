Text: I had always been a travel enthusiastic but I never knew it was something deeper
  than just traveling. I never had a normal family and I did not realise what my real
  home was until I started traveling. I was exploring the northern part of my country
  where I realised, the place I called a home was not home for me. And I don't have
  a fixed home, many people find think their home is where they live, or find it in
  a person, but I found it in traveling and the best part of my home is it frequently
  changes but it still feels like a part of me.
