Text: "Just with $500, I started my journey from India. Booked flights the same day\
  \ I was travelling while sitting in train unknown of what's next. \nWell, from deserts\
  \ to snow covered mountains to beaches. All turned in reality, when I took a chance\
  \ to step out of my comfort zone and go on with what my heart says and wants. \n\
  Buddha said, what you think you become and I always imagined myself just travelling\
  \ and getting amazed by every site my eyes witnesses. Every moment that felt as\
  \ if time was stopped for me.\nIn this so called defined path of society I choose\
  \ to leap to unknown path and go with flow.\nAnd get surprised at every step you\
  \ take."
