Text: 'Bhutan as our neighborhood always fascinated me in terms of their authenticity
  and simplicity. But I never knew this small country could be an example to whole
  world in terms of keeping their originality.

  My resent vist to Bhutan made me realise that there is a country where your fashionable
  styles will be waste because this country and its people are proudly wearing their
  traditional dress which is also their national dress.

  Bhutan is the only country where people are non veg yet there are no slaughter House
  in any part of country. They are so peace loving that you will only see smiles greeting
  you everywhere.'
