Text: "Looking for the BEAUTY of culture through HANDS of people that make art with\
  \ the soul of their own enviorement. The materials, textures,  colors, smells...\
  \ with the touch of their history and customs. The meaning of the things that they\
  \ use beyong the logical reason. \nbasing all the historical, family, political\
  \ and economic events that could lead those areas to express themselves in the way\
  \ they express themselves through their crafts and artistic expressions.\nwhat is\
  \ the movement that involves making art, what are the facilities, where do they\
  \ get the raw material, what difficulty do they have to get it, how much they earn\
  \ to be able to maintain this trade.\nInvestigate which existing institutions provide\
  \ support to these HANDS and what importance you have at governmental, tourist,\
  \ social and above all patrimonial level.\ninvestigate if other customs or crafts\
  \ have ceased to exist and why. try to serve as a bridge and leave them a productive\
  \ link in favor of their community and their cultural heritage ... so that they\
  \ can perpetuate their customs."
