Text: "I went to Peru from Ecuador the bridge where I pass was called Guaquyas from\
  \ Guayaquil to Tumbes (Peru) \nI stayed a bit in Tumbes but then i\u2019ve decided\
  \ to go to Lima, going with normal transport was too long so i\u2019ve decided to\
  \ take a plane which was the best solution and was cheap as well \nWhen I arrived\
  \ in Lima the weather was so humid \nLima is a bit dangerous everyone try to take\
  \ advantage of you, so you need to be really careful \nI\u2019ve decided to stay\
  \ in Lima just for couple of days and come back to Europe \nEcuador was much nicer\
  \ even the people\nSo I will advise more to go to Ecuador than Peru"
