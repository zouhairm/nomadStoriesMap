Text: I feel wondering when I was heard this Travel writing adventure. I really want
  to attend this adventurous seminar. My story is based on different shades of peoples
  bcoz we know that in our world we all have a different religion n culture so I want
  to be exploring whole the fact about this. I always preferring humanity bcoz everywhere
  in the world people know each other by humanity. Today many of them are destroying
  our beautiful world by their unkindness thinking. The main thing about adventure
  is to meet different shadez of people and knowing well their culture and festivals.
  we all humans are same but different is religion n culture so I want to be exploring
  that if their is no religion so we all are take stands for our peoples n showing
  humanity. One common thing about humans is rich man can't live more than poor man.
  This is small story which I want to complete with making a local connection.
