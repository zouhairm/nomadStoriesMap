Text: This story is about the sacrifices my parents made for me as a child. My father
  giving up his dream of being a cricketer and my mother gave up her dream as a teacher.
  I was not aware about the sacrifices they made for me any my sister to prosper.
  Due to this I have made some horrible mistakes which still does haunt  and disappoint
  them.. however I have become a young professional with two masters degree one in
  sustainable manufacturing and other in business, which made them hopefully proud
  and delete the hard time I gave them during the bad times. This will be a connection
  through the parents and how the Muslim kid is bought up in an Indian culture with
  mural heritage.
