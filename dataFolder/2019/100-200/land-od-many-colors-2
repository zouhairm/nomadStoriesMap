Text: Since I was a kid my parents loved traveling, my grandparents where quite affluent
  so they invited us to several trips to different countries, we were a well-educated
  Mexican family with the means to travel more than common people in our time, so
  we took with great seriousness the intent to try to learn as much as possible from
  every place we visited and understood that way the essence of the differences between
  people around the world. We have therefore become diplomats in a way cause we all
  my cousins and I have great international friendships and we maintain our inner
  conviction of being an ambassador of the marvels of our country before the world.
