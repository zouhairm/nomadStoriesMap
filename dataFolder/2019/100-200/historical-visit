  Indian Culture and people, I''m from Afghanistan, born and growth here in own country,
  everybody know about Afghanistan and condition here, people are in very bad condition,
  narrow minded, cruelty lots of other problems are here, once I saw for the first

  which we had in college was history, Indian history was amazing very interesting,

  by other empires, from 985 to 1945 many countries was attacked to India and they
  done lots of bad and good things to India, finally how India got there Independent
