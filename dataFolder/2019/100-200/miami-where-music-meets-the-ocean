Text: "When they ask about my state of mind, I say Miami. And there's a reason why!\n\
  Imagine the wind unfolding the braids of your hair, the music making your soul dance\
  \ like no one's watching, the food releasing flavors into your spirits making you\
  \ high in seconds, And you reach into a whole new dimension. Open your eyes, you're\
  \ in Miami. \nThe very first day in this beautiful city, I let my feet get washed\
  \ up in the cold blue Waters with a lovely weather. With people, fine as cherries\
  \ on top and interesting as a game of cards, I started my scholarship with Florida\
  \ international University in network security and cyber forensics. \nFrom the greatest\
  \ technologies to the hard-to-find humbleness, people offered everything. I could\
  \ still lie down on the beach to watch the sun set every single day, for the rest\
  \ of my life. \nPeople say, you got to die to see the heaven. I got you wrong, because\
  \ miami is where you find it. The heaven on Earth."
