Text: "I have loved travel for as long as I can remember. My parents instilled that\
  \ in me at a very young age. Our summers, and a lot of our weekends, were spent\
  \ travelling in our RV. We did a lot of local trips here in Afghanistan \U0001F1E6\
  \U0001F1EB but also went on some long haul journeys. We drove to Goa across India\
  \ and to Tajikistan \U0001F1F9\U0001F1EF just to name a few. I loved seeing new\
  \ places and learning about the history and culture. Social Studies was always my\
  \ favourite subject in school. The travel bug bit me hard in eleventh grade, when\
  \ I took my first trip to India, It was a school trip and the first time I had ever\
  \ been on a plane (I was so nervous!) We started in Afghanistan and made our way\
  \ down to India And then I fell in love. Not puppy-dog, high school love. This was\
  \ true love. The kind of love that consumes you, that pains you to be away from.\
  \ The kind of love that lasts forever."
