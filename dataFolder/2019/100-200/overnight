Text: I had never traveled in my life. One night I was sitting on my laptop, going
  through my facebook feed. I was in a travel facebook group even though I had never
  used it. They were talking about couchsurfing. The idea that I can stay somewhere
  for free and make local connections excited me immediately. I checked my savings
  and ended up purchasing a ticket to Paris. Even though I didn't stay with a couch
  I ended up in an Airbnb. I was nervous, I even thought of not going. When I arrived,
  I immediately went to Sacre-Coeur and walked all through Montmartre. I discovered
  artists. On my first day, the house was empty however the next day I woke up to
  the sound of opera singing. The person I was sharing the house with had arrived.
  She was a very interesting person. We talked for hours and she ended up taking me
  to the small theaters of Paris. We discovered the city together. She took me to
  her favorite restaurants and because of her, my trip was amazing. This is how I
  fell in love with traveling.
