Text: My friend and i went in a travel to a soccer game in the most bigger stadium
  of Minas Gerais. The trip was by bus and we were one of the five women in the group.
  Would be my first time going on a stadium, my friend love it but i was just glad
  to be there, every experience make me excited. Since when we get the bus until the
  place of the game we get in a natural men space, and i never see in person so many
  men together, i was expect so many things on this trip, i mean bad things, but was
  really good. Into the stadium was very calm, okay... i got a little scared with
  the noises and bad words until i understood that it was normal and was not going
  to a fight and over time i felt comfortable in that "men space" in a place that
  i didn't expect to find. Sadly our team lost that day but we return with such energy
  and laughing all the way back home.
