Text: "I was a smart independent women. But recently got married to a very sweet man.\
  \ But since the time I\u2019m married I lost all my identity, my confidence, myself.\
  \ It\u2019s not like my married life is not good it\u2019s just that I have lost\
  \ my independence my freedom to travel, I was a traveller I used to enjoy solo trips\
  \ but not can\u2019t even to a places near by, in this process of not being able\
  \ to travel and love my self I\u2019m losing myself, my confidence, my self esteem.\
  \ That\u2019s why I want to win this trip so that I can find my self back and let\
  \ the world know and help many other females like to travel and live their life,\
  \ the way they want to. Every women deserve to be happy."
