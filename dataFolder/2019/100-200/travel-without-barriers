Text: I am in Gaza so my travel is not like yours travel. To go to another city in
  Gaza strip I considered it travel because of the occupation. If l want to go to
  another countries I will sufur of three days or more in the siage no place.... no
  food... no.... . So, now I will tell you my travel by walking (in bus11) with my
  sister. 12/8/2018, we wake up early at 5 am and started walking to the north beside
  the sea. While our travel we saw various animals, people and said hey to them and
  got to know them. We ate our breakfast with the sound of the beach and then while
  walking we go to the strawbery failds. I love going to wedding even though I am
  not invited, I entered a wedding hall and got some interesting. We continued walking
  until we saw our home Almajdal ( the place our grandmother and grandfather have
  imgrated) yes, we reached our purpose and returned home.
