Text: "June 2016, I received ticket to Banff, Canada as the TED Ed 2nd cohort. Most\
  \ of the people mentioned that Banff is the inspirational city around the world.\
  \ When I was landed there and saw the mountain, river, valley, I realized that the\
  \ heaven is on earth is true. \n\nOne activity that I committed to do is nature\
  \ walk. I feel the breeze along the way until I reach the lake named Louis. It is\
  \ so majestic. The water is like a crystal clear. Touching the water is an unforgettable\
  \ moment. It makes me want to get married in this place.\n\nBanff, Alberta was the\
  \ final of unecpected journey that my feet stop. Until now, I kept dreaming on it.\
  \ Spending 5 days there was truly amazing. Looking at the night sky makes me dance\
  \ under the star. It was fabolous. I will keep this memory everlasting as the majestic\
  \ touch from the creator comes alive there."
