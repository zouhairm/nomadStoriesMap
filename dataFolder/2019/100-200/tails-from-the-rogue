Text: "I am a survivor and single mama who happens to be a mermaid with wanderlust\
  \ and gypsea soul! I have committed to living a life by my design and spreading\
  \ my message of empowerment and self love.  \n  Last year I was assaulted and my\
  \ whole life was leveled out completely. I lost my career, car, home, everything.\
  \ I threw myself into myself for the first time and have been on a journey to the\
  \ heart of me. I want to see the world and write everything and talk to as many\
  \ people as possible and spread my story for it is my strength. Swim Fast! Dive\
  \ Deep! Go Rogue and live with a light that cannot be dimmed.  I have been writing\
  \ and building my Rogue Mermaid brand and have just now feeling like I am starting\
  \ to WHOLLY live for me. Being a single mom it\u2019s so hard to wear every hat\
  \ and travel is hard and you have to sacrifice so much. I want to show myself and\
  \ my daughter that you can be preserverant AF and glow up no matter what."
