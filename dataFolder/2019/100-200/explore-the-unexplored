Text: I am been an avid backpacker and traveller.I have travelled for 1 and a half
  year in India and exited to nepal by road.My journey as a solo backpacker and then
  making friends from all across the globe while my travel is unbelievable and finest
  diaries and enough to write a script or film the series for netflix.My first time
  backpacking in my life had made me strong enough and i know my self i am great at
  exploring places, meeting people and sharing tea and food around.I also travelled
  in 10 cities in 3 different states in 1 month on trains.All my journey was road,
  train trips hitchhiking and staying with strangers with no luxury and guide or travel
  package at all.I went to world's highest post office and world's highest village
  as well in india.
