Text: In 2018, my year didn't start off on the right foot. I was at the lowest parts
  of my life. However, in March I decided to move to Paris and do my internship abroad
  for 2 months. During every weekend I travelled as much as I could in neighbouring
  cities. Taking that leap and travelling solo as a woman was scary at first, but
  it was the best moments of my life. I first felt at peace with myself, my past and
  my future when I got to Luzern, Switzerland. The city was so beautiful and peaceful,
  I almost felt at home. Walking through the beautiful city, I met beautiful people
  and friends that I still keep in touch with now. I also discovered the mountains
  for the first time and the feeling was incredible. Being so high up in the mountains,
  and seeing the amazing view was just breathtaking. A lot of people say I'm courageous
  for travelling solo, but it honestly is the best feeling and the best thing for
  yourself. The time you have alone to grow, to think, and to love yourself is amazing.
