Text: I traveled to the Faw Mountains of Sudan and found a natural beauty in those
  areas. It was a beautiful and fun journey to a certain extent, where I saw many
  interesting things, but the magnificent mountains of Faw are beautiful. They have
  beautiful views and heritage. These carved rocks are of natural shapes and colors.
  Is the heart of nature spring and wonderful spirit and from there you travel to
  the area called Gedaref famous for the wonderful sesame crop and buildings that
  are made in the form of a pyramid It really beautiful homes and cool cold in summer
  and warm winter I wish to visit again and enjoy one day.
