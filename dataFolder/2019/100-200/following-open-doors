Text: 'Traveling solo has helped me open inner and out doors in ways I''d never expected,
  especially after shutting down over the last 2 years.  I had just lost my job, went
  on my month long trip to France anyway (because it was all planned and paid for!)
  and sat in an energy that was the most dark and delicate I''ve ever known.  So much
  was opening up, but I didn''t know it.  I kept noticing doors- poster artwork of
  doors, the massive Cathedral wooden doors, slightly open doors to tucked away art
  galleries; places that seemed so momentous of a gate that lead me to new places
  within my self.  I was ready but so terrified to step inside. Slowly.  Surely.  The
  doors of Bordeaux beckoned me in, and I found not just local gems, but inner treasure
  as I stepped along my new path.


  **I would like to illustrate this story, using photos and sketches from my travel
  sketchbook.  My travel journals and illustration can be seen online : http://annieruygtillustration.com'
