Text: Hello! I am rahma. I don't run a travel very often. I only spend a little time
  traveling. it made me feel that the short trip was very valuable! I once spent just
  1 day running away from a very annoying routine. I was with 4 of my female friends.
  Girls day out! me and they have fun all day long. surround 1 city along with full
  cost and language limitations. however, there are always things that are not good.
  between their crowd my little heart asked me to go alone. yes, travel alone! the
  trip where I spent my time without people I knew before, together with people from
  other areas that I could invite to exchange culture, and what I could invite to
  make a new story of life. well, to be honest, I hope to find my soul mate when I'm
  running solo travel with institutions or not. someone who can survive with me, who
  has the same goal. namely writing to be used as a story and lesson for every woman
  and man who waits for her soul mate.
