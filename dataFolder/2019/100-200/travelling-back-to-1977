Text: "It all started in Amsterdam at the Eritrean embassy, where even as a total\
  \ stranger was treated like a VIP, given the visa and a local government officer\u2019\
  s number for any assistance required.\n\nLeft Istanbul in the evening and arrived\
  \ late in the night in Asmara international airport, it is the same as it was when\
  \ I last left in 1977, the only difference was that very young women were in charge\
  \ of security.\nMy sister and step brother were outside along with maybe 50 other\
  \ people, in the dark and chilli but the warmth of being there made it very pleasant.\n\
  \nReached a very basic local home where I was greeted with a hugh and immediately\
  \ a cup of chai. The next morning I woke up refreshed and rested and assisted in\
  \ making zighini for dinner, it was amazing!\n\nThe visit to the local cemetery\
  \ was so fulfilling that I am planning another trip in August, hoping to see the\
  \ old man that was happily sipping his chai in caff\xE8 Catedrale and then just\
  \ take in the energy the peace and calm high street radiates naturally."
