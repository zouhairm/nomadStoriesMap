Text: "After living in Spain, Belgium, and Portugal, Michiel and I returned to Brazil.\
  \ There, we decided that it was time to live new adventures. Our chosen city was\
  \ Montreal \u2013 a multicultural city \u2013 in the francophone province of Canada.\
  \ We decided to spend 6 months there, open to the experiences that this still-unknown\
  \ city could offer us. We loved the experience, but our time was over, and on November\
  \ 26 last year, we left the city heading for Portugal, not knowing exactly when\
  \ we would go back to Montreal. In a pleasant surprise from destiny, Michiel was\
  \ invited to work in Montreal. After 3 months living in Lisbon, we returned to Montreal,\
  \ much sooner than we expected. And here we are, 9 months later, with the feeling\
  \ that we chose the right city to live in. I am very grateful to my parents for\
  \ always being supportive of our crazy wanderlust plans :) ! and the wonderful friends\
  \ we have made here so far from all those places, they make this journey of new\
  \ experiences even more fascinating and rewarding."
