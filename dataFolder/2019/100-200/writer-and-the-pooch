Text: I am a nomad from Finland and currently in Spain - this is the 9th country I
  am visiting with my dog. My dog has been my travel companion for the past five years
  and we explore dog friendly restaurants, cafes, hotels, airbnbs and always seeking
  out outdoor activities etc that we can do together. we always make friends with
  dogs and dog people and I wouldn't want to travel without my best friend. I'd happy
  to be part of this community and participate in the "all expenses paid" travel and
  share our travel experiences with others. I also write and paint - so I can also
  share my paintings I'd make based on the local inspirations. Thank you for your
  consideration!
