Text: "Since the daily I landed in Muscat, Oman I admired the efortless natural beauty,\
  \ fascinating and well-preserved cultures and locals renowned for their generous\
  \ hospitality \u2013 Oman may occupy the tip of the Arabian peninsular, but it\u2019\
  s really the heart and soul of the Middle East.\n\nMuch like the UAE, the Sultanate\
  \ of Oman has developed rapidly thanks to its oil wealth. But Oman is far more humble\
  \ than its northern neighbour. One of the most robust heritage protection strategies\
  \ in the Gulf has helped safeguard Omani and Bedouin cultures against the tides\
  \ of change. Meanwhile, a long coastline and interior desert wrapped in spectacular\
  \ mountains makes Oman prime territory for outdoor adventures.\nThe positivity environment\
  \ and the modest combination with the historical enthusiasm was overwhelming ,even\
  \ after landing back to my country I missed those incredibly beautiful visions and\
  \ positivity releasing sight."
