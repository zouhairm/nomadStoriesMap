Text: The older I've gotten, the more confused I've become about traveling. I've always
  considered it the ultimate goal. Work to travel. Live to travel. Then I met Jared,
  and we got two dogs, who are basically our kids. I recently went on a nearly 20-day
  trip to Israel and I loved it, but I also never felt totally at home. I teeter tottered
  the edge between wanting to be home, and loving what I was doing. Now I've been
  back for about a month, and I'm yearning for it again. My life has gone back to
  it's day to day (work, work out, social time, repeat) -- and I wonder what I want.
  How do you fully embrace travel when you have something waiting for you on the other
  side? But how do you not travel, when it's what you love?
