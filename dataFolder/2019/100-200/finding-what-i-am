Text: "I live in S\xE3o Paulo, i had a dream in august 2017 about Florianopolis and\
  \ I swear that I never know that city.\nThen, I meet a friend who was going there,\
  \ so I understand that I really need to go too. I had courage, some money and I\
  \ go to Florianopolis, the island of magic. \nWhen I was there I find myself, pure\
  \ like a mineral on the earth just waiting the light of the sun, I meet no one then\
  \ my recent friend and that was enough. Many people wanted to talk with me, just\
  \ know who I am and I was searching for the answer.\nSo, I back to my city so different\
  \ that I tell for everyone can be who want to be, like the island of magic show\
  \ me."
