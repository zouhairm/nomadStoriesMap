Text: I never have dream go to India before. 26 November untill 3 Desember 2016 i
  never forget that date. The date i go to India for the first time. I feel excited
  and nervous in same time. My friend help me a lot during a week i stay in Mumbai.
  He take me around Mumbai . We go to Elephanta Island, Kahneri Cave, Gate of India,
  National Park, Marine bay, Museum and many other place. I cant forget the experience
  when i am there. I try many food kare, dosa, samosa, ladu and many other food. My
  friend also told me about culture and language. Really new knowledge for me. We
  go around Mumbi and teach me how to talk in hindi language. I meet many people and
  they are very good and kind. In the last day i stay in India they are ask me to
  stay more longer but cos of my work i cant stay there more longer time. I have return
  back to my country cos my office give time only a week. I feel disapointed. India
  is really unforgotable experience. I said to my self i have return back to india
  next time.
