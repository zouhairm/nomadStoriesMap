Text: I went to this place in India called manali. Its the heaven of India with so
  much of nature and lovely , cooperative human beings. I remember this incidence
  we took a bus to visit a buddhist temple and while returning we came to know that
  the bus will come after an hour  so we were waiting clicking pictures and just enjoying
  the hills covered in snow, the rivers flowing,the sound of the river i can still
  remember and later a truck stopped by and asked us whether we wanted help and we
  all were so happy because of this grear gesture as you can't experience this in
  a city and this was so nice ,we agreed to the man and when we reached to our destination
  the town basically that man didn't ask for money. That the best memory i would never
  forget and ever cherrish.. This gives us a hope and tells us that humanity still
  exists and we also should also share our contributions .
