Text: "Girls love seeing; sight seeing, right? \n\nRight. \n\nSo I decided to turn\
  \ myself into a sim card and \"Port\".\nHonestly it wasn't because I was tried of\
  \ the crime and corruption my country was facing but rather because ever since I\
  \ was a child; my eyes have been on the world and every time I traveled, someone\
  \ somewhere would say the phrase \"U gal!\" As an expression to my evergreen spirit\
  \ in travel. So why not Port-U-Gal. Get it. Portugal\n\nThe country of bliss with\
  \ atmosphere filled in adventure and colour. The country where romance isn't promoted\
  \ but dished out fresh. A country that looked, smelled and felt nothing like my\
  \ own but too became home.\n\nI do not know yet what awaits me here - stick around\
  \ for I will detail all my experiences. But I know that it's going to be more than\
  \ a dream and more importantly it will be a change in reality. \n\n\nSo join me\
  \ on my adventure and read up. \nCome on girlfriend and Port-U-Gal"
