Text: "I've been surviving a chaotic family since I was born, each trauma sucessed\
  \ by a even more inimaginable one. From being  sexuallu abused to being sent to\
  \ jail to cover for my mother's sketchy business, to being forced to take care of\
  \ my older sisters who alchose yo avoid our dark reality through parrying and drugs.\n\
  \nLast year my Sister, who is 2 years older than me, commited suicide, and it was\
  \ the end of my 'I'm a viking, I can take it' lifestyle. \n\nMy brain decided it\
  \ was enough, and I got a psichiatric colapse called dissosiative disorder, where\
  \ your psyche can't deal with so much angst and decides to split away from your\
  \ body.\n\nI've been doing a big self-discovery Journey to my inner layers of repressed\
  \ trauma, and have discover Ed the most amazing things.\n\nI would love to writte\
  \ about this entire Journey and hopefully develop the last chapter of inner healing\
  \ in this trip."
