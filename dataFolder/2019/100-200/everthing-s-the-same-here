Text: 'As far as it goes, I was rooting into this idea of everything is the same.
  And the only reason people get amused and excited over a travel plan is the way
  they fantasize about it. On the first sight of a new city there comes a woosh in
  their ears that ''this is it?'' And here in city of Milan wasn''t that much different
  either, at least for me.

  ''is this it?'', I asked and my friend looked at me with so much disappointment
  in her eyes telling me why do I have to be like this.

  Not long after she left the city but I stayed, without any reason but the job that
  was keeping me here and the lack of motivation of going somewhere else.

  It is not about the places and the cities,I think.It''s about you and how you can
  experience it. It is not about the big old churches and statues. No lake and seaside
  is beautiful without the right person. And that person is not someone you''ll find
  easily. It''s somewhere inside you. You should try to find it sooner. I know I should!'
