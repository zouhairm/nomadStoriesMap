Text: "Obidos, Portugal was recently added to the list of official \"book towns\"\
  . It hosts the F\xF3lio Festival of Literature, the biggest literary event in the\
  \ country. Big name authors and publishers attend the festival to promote current\
  \ and upcoming works. My story would be an in-depth look at how literature became\
  \ so central to Obidos, and what factors (i.e. famous authors, companies or individuals)\
  \ contributed to creating the festival and instilling a love of books in the town.\
  \ The story would also delve into how a town becomes an official \"book town\" and\
  \ which other towns in the world have this categorization. \n\nI'd also write up\
  \ a sort of \"day at the festival\" piece explaining what attendees can expect and\
  \ what kinds of cost they should consider when planning their trip. It would include\
  \ accommodation and food options for attendees, and a list of the kinds of activities,\
  \ seminars, and performances put on during the festival. \n\nI'm also a photographer,\
  \ so I would include photographs of the festival and attendees."
