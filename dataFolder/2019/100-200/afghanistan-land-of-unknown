Text: 'I traveled twice to Uzbekistan, a quiet city and unscrupulous people in Afghanistan''s
  neighborhoods.

  Symbols of the past empires in this city, especially large buildings and beautiful
  minarets, are the artifact of the efforts and thoughts of the people of their time.

  The Silk Road is the largest sympathetic pattern of nations. and still the silk
  route is the passageway of thousands of tourists from different nationalities, and
  this shows that such tourist attractions have the capacity to interact and exchange
  their thoughts and expands it every day.

  It was interesting and informative for me to visit Uzbekistan; people are completely
  shocked when they watch such civilization symbols that bring many people together
  from all over the world.'
