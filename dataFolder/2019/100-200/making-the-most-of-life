Text: When one sets out on a journey many plans are made, but in the end things always
  work out as they are supposed to. Looking back at everything all I can say is "I
  would do it all over again". In 2017, I was working as an English teacher in Brazil,
  then suddenly the need to explore the world became bigger than everything else I
  had going on. I decided to study in Dublin and within a month my whole life was
  inside two suitcases and one box. Dublin was surreal, beautiful and exquisite. I
  felt at home as soon as I arrived. What I didn't know was that this one decision
  would take me to so many places I never thought possible. I have always played it
  safe, always planned and never acted on inpulse. This decision took me places. I
  visited 16 countries and lived my life to the fullest, I even fell in love. I am
  so ready for what's to come.
