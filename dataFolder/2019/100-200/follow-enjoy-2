Text: "An Argentine man, a Spanish woman and two Mexican men; Yes, it sounds like\
  \ a joke, we were in the south of Chile in the ninth region, in Puc\xF3n, we decided\
  \ to travel further south, to Chiloe, however Guido, the Argentinian, started the\
  \ trip a day earlier, Loren, Laia and me, we traveled one day afterwards, we did\
  \ not know where to go and we did not know where Guido had stayed, we decided to\
  \ take a leap into the unknown, we arrived in Puerto Montt north of Chiloe, we left\
  \ the bus station and decided to follow a group of foreigners, it seemed that If\
  \ they knew where they were going, on the way we found Guido, and we continued to\
  \ the hostel where he stayed, we went to dinner and then Guido told us that when\
  \ he arrived he did not know where to go so he followed a group of foreigners, just\
  \ like us , foreigners joined the talk, and they also did not know where to stay,\
  \ the amazing is in this group was there French woman, she studied the university\
  \ in the same city like me, in Mexico, that was incredible!"
