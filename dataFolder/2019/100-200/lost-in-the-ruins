Text: I'm not experienced and an often traveler, it was just a small vacation I got
  after the exam. I always had an urge to explore some offbeat places which don't
  get disturbed by the crowd and then I chose my place and it was Hampi a village
  area that is far from civilized chaos situated in Karnataka. spending days in Hampi
  was such a soul refining experience every day you woke up by the devotional which
  plays from the next temple and the woman all are busy in designing the 'kolam' (a
  kind of morning ritual) Hampi is famous for its sculptures and the vast fascinating
  history lies behind it. its also included among the UNESCO world heritage sites.
  what makes the whole difference is the innocent people and I do learn a bit Kannada
  for a better conversation with the people because unlike Bangalore most people in
  Hampi doesn't speak English.in short, what really makes Hampi special is its own
  culture the countless amount of isolated temples and especially don't forget to
  visit hippie village at least for a short term you can have a bohemian life at there.
