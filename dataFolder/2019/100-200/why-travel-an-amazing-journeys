Text: "Travel is the connection between human soul with Food, History, Culture and\
  \ People. \nTraveling rarely Disappoint me. There are many variable things in life\
  \ I.e Family, Professional life and above all Relationships\nTravel is beyond them\
  \ and it gives many life adventures and excursions with various Experiences. I love\
  \ to travel because it heals and unleash me from various emotional incidences and\
  \ if you have fun, you would definitely love it\u263A\uFE0F\U0001F60D. Travel is\
  \ the Coincidence to meet so many diversity in life which was unknown and unrevealing\
  \ for us. Many people love mystery and my love towards mystery is deep. Sometimes\
  \ you experience life without Google maps. Some things are only to feel and know\
  \ with enthusiasm and I find it beautiful as life is so beautiful if we make it\
  \ lovely with nature and things created with the human intellect conversation to\
  \ art, history and monuments.  I find every travel interesting as I write many stories\
  \ too on paruliyaworld on. Please follow me on Instagram : paruliyaworld."
