Text: "In the late 1940s, my father and his father went by the train to visit his\
  \ grandmother, who lived in a secluded village. It was noon, on a hot summer day,\
  \ the first time he met his grandmother. My father worked as a farmer who was only\
  \ 8 years old, Approximately 30 kilometers.\n\_They arrived late. As I passed through\
  \ the corridor, my father, through the curtains of the window, pointed to my grandmother\
  \ wandering around the hall, like a skeleton covered with clothes, laughing at what\
  \ he saw, forcing him to put his bags at the threshold and wait five minutes before\
  \ he entered. My grandmother stayed at this late hour waiting for him, and she kept\
  \ a hot plate for dinner and kept the fire burning in the hall."
