Text: This is a story of an over weight girl who decided to live out her dreams and
  travel the world solo. She never wanted to travel before because she was insecure
  about her weight. All the pictures she saw from her dream destinations only had
  skinny models. She honestly thought she had to be a size 2 to travel the world.
  After years of building up her self confidence, she decided to take a leap of faith
  and take her first solo trip to the Dominican Republic. She wore a 2pcs bathing
  suit and everything. That trip was a defining moment for her and she decided that
  this was something she needed to do every year. A solo trip to a new destination
  and leaving the insecurities and self doubt at home.
