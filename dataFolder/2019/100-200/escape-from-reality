Text: I'm talking about Shantiniketan,Westbengal a place of peace l,  love and music
  in India. The place where Rabindranath Tagore spent his most time,  the place of
  art culture and music.  The place where Viswavarati University is nurturing talents
  from all over the globe. The place of Bauls (folk singers)  and artist. This is
  the place to connect with our very own self.  This is the place where you'll wake
  with bird's call and sleep with a rhythmic gloomy tune of grasshoppers.  This place
  is Another reality from my place where I've found colors instead of greys and I
  call a trip to Shantiniketan an "escape from reality" (In Freddie Mc. Curry's words).Visit
  once and your life will be changed by nature's touch and you will find your self..  :)
