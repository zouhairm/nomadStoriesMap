Text: "Moments. That\u2019s what I answer when friends ask what was the best part\
  \ of a trip. It\u2019s the little things that connect us to people that make a trip\
  \ special. When traveling in China, Henan province to be more specific, I encountered\
  \ a joyful surprise. Outside a Buddhist temple was a monument inscribed with musical\
  \ notes and Chinese writing. My English friend suggested we try and hum the notes.\
  \ Just as she said this a smiling Chinese man and his family stepped up and began\
  \ singing this national song. His voice was lively and his wife and three children\
  \ cheered him on. We videoed his performance and the warmth of this man stays with\
  \ me today. After all, it\u2019s people we encounter on a trip that make the difference.\
  \ And moments like this we remember."
