Text: 'If we think about the past and the past of the past, we can find that increasing
  population made the people to leave there first living homeland and travel another
  place; but this travel couldn''t carry all there culture with them just they carried
  there bests and they changed what they didn''t want. Means the culture is make by
  humans according to there own interests. And I wanna find that best similarity between
  the world and show the world that the are actually one unit with different themes.

  Photography is my first weapon for this journy. I started my journey from Afghanistan
  then Pakistan and now its time for Portugal.

  I will be pleased to be approved in this program.'
