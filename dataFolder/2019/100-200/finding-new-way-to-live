Text: Sometimes a sudden trip gives you a major experience and immense happiness,
  and it happened with me, when I was suddenly told that we are about to go home but
  this time by road, I have never experienced this kind of trip and it was just more
  beautiful than what I have imagined. In every kilometer the people I met and the
  places I  went was like I am finding new way to live my life. It was 1 week trip
  from New Delhi to Patna via Agra, Mathura and Varansi, which is I think my most
  beautiful journey till date and every city ot town has its own story to tell, its
  lifestyle, way of living, tradition and people will tell you that the beauty of
  its own rawness. Whenever I think about that journey I fall in love with it everytime
  and I started dreaming about it.
