Text: "A story of a young, wild Arab woman who finds herself crippled under the disease\
  \ of addiction. Blind to her own entrapment she is forced by her family to choose\
  \ between jail or a treatment facility in Thailand. Scared and desperate she decides\
  \ with the latter; ultimately metamorphosizing into her soul's true purpose. She\
  \ discovers the treasures of the world buried deep inside her heart, released from\
  \ the pain of drug abuse, she begins to see that she must help others to heal their\
  \ pain and thus begin the planting of the World she had longed to be a part of.\
  \ A World in ultimate alignment with unconditional love. \n\nBefore she masters\
  \ the art of healing, her journey must, however, begin with herself. For the first\
  \ seed she plants is from within, she must learn how to nurture and love herself\
  \ or she will never truly align herself with unconditional love. Her story follows\
  \ the wonderous enmeshment of raw truth, dug deep from painful and distorted memories."
