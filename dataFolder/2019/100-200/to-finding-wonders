Text: Travelling was not my priority until there was a wedding that took place in
  MULTAN. My cousin was going to marry a girl that was  broad-up in multan. Celebrations
  were in full swings and all of our family was ecstatic to be going there. It was
  our first ever family trip to anywhere but the fun part was. It was a road trip.
  By passing of different cities we explored alot of different cultures and lifestyles
  and you would automatically remember the roads and the maps or the name of the cities
  though google map helped us alot but when you travel to find yourself or you change
  the way you do thing because of others. This was one of those trips to adjust to
  others likes and dislikes to others comfort. Thats what life is all about to treat
  people who they want to be treated and they wills surely treat you the right way
  that you deserve.
