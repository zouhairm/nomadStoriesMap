Text: "I love to travel. Most of my travels,is with family. Europe is a favourite\
  \ destination for travel. I have never been to Portugal. So it\u2019s an unfamiliar\
  \ territory for me. My sightings will inspire others to travel to this destination\
  \ as I will be sharing what I see, feel and smell through a fresh set of eyes. I\
  \ have travel to many countries in Europe but Southern Europe is my most favourite\
  \ destination especially te Cote De\u201D Azur areas. I believe many people are\
  \ not familiar with Portugal and being an Indian and having visited Goa extensively\
  \ it seems Portugal would be a larger extension of Goa. My travel covers specific\
  \ spots, food, culture and I capture the real deal through my,lenses wherever I\
  \ travel. I am in love with Europe for its alfresco culture which you hardly see\
  \ in Asia."
