Text: Amalgamation of cultures, with biodiversities and also diversity among climate
  in india, make us belief of eqality and oneness. We all are different instead of
  being connected, every corner of my country is flourished with beauty in its own
  with wonders. Exploring the wonders of my country is my goal, by visiting different
  states having different rituals, climatic conditions etc. I visited many places
  like goa, shimla, masoori, Macleod gang, and many more, all are full of miracles
  and wonders, I felt wonder in ocean music at goa,  snow mountains at Macleod gang.
  Paragliding experience at dharamshala is marvellous, feeling like we turn up into
  a bird, temples also I visited recently which gave me a sense of spirituality specially
  visiting vridanvan daam where people are mad with their canting songs and dancing,
  the place is very different I wish I visit puri also very soon.
