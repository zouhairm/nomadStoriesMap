Text: "I\u2019ve been having this dream about going to Slovaquia, like something\u2019\
  s calling me, places that claim to be known. Im mexican, my culture is warm and\
  \ welcoming, and even tho the countries are way too different, I\u2019d love to\
  \ visit this magical place, full of story, I want to walk into those beautiful streets,\
  \ meet new people and enjoy every minute of it. I had a friend that went to Slovaquia\
  \ for an study exchange, and he had the best time, traveling in trains, living extraordinary\
  \ adventures. he enjoyed life so much, you can tell, because every photo he shared\
  \ he captioned: \u201Cse feliz\u201D which means \u201Cbe happy\u201D and I fell\
  \ in love with that, and I promised to myself that someday I\u2019ll be visiting\
  \ this wonderful land to live and feel that, I\u2019d love to live this experience\
  \ with my family (mom, dad and my sister). Thank you! Blessings"
