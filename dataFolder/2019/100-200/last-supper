Text: I did the Camino Portuguese last year with my mother and two friends.  The journey
  was to honour my father who had passed away suddenly on the Camino the year before.
  He had kept a small journal of his travels on the Camino with my mother.  The journal
  is a collection of notes on the places he stopped for a meal.  The notes were mostly
  about the journey and the food he enjoyed.  It is a treasured little journal and
  I found it my closest connection to him on the trip last year.  I would love to
  go back and turn that food journey into something more rich and meaningful to share
  with others.
