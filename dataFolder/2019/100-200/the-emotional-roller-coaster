Text: I got invitation from Bangladesh to deliver a speech as the representative of
  my country , India. I didn't have passport on that time so It was very uncertain
  Whether I would be able to make that or not. Finally when I got everything as in
  my visa passport i started for Bangladesh without knowing anything like how to go
  from where to go. I went to the bongaon border I crossed that and took a bus for
  Dhaka. I had very less time to visit the places in Dhaka because I had to attend
  the seminar but still I managed some time and went to explore the city. I covered
  all the historical places like the Dhaka Sajid minar, the Dhaka Kali Mandir , Dhaka
  Musueam. The true spirit of a city lies in the local public transport. I traveled
  visa that also, and most importantly I tasted the local delicacy Bangladeshi pithe
  which was amezing. My journey was short and it was my first international trip without
  my family. There was no internet or netwoy connection so I barley could contact
  with my family. This trip was truly an emotional roller coaster for me.
