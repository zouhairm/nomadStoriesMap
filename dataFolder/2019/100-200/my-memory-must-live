Text: "I was in Dubai visiting a modern City , I ate the best Arabic Food , I visited\
  \ Dubai Tower , I walked in Dubai Mall and Dubai streets , I enjoyed too much.\n\
  I asked myself so many Questions , one of them is why i`am not living here and keep\
  \ my moments live here, but how\nSo my memory must live more than me , keeping my\
  \ pictures and videos at Restaurants, Hotel, Park, Museum .\nLike Ancient Egyptians\
  \ and other Civilizations , People need to live for ever.\nMemorial Moments , Memorial\
  \ Items , creating Loyalty to cities and countries.\nMany jobs will be available.\n\
  My idea is to create Memorial Building in any location that Guests and Public visit\
  \ it, when they eat, when they feed, when they visit.\nMemorial Building can keep\
  \ photos and videos for Visitors with code in the save place on in computers, which\
  \ can help people to visit location again and again to watch it and remember their\
  \ moments with friends and Relatives.\nThis service will save jobs for Computer\
  \ Technicians, Tourist Guides, Photographers and many other jobs.\nloyalty will\
  \ avoid Violence all over the world.  \nI will be happy and People will be happy."
