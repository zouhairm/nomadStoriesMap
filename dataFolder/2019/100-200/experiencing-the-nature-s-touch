Text: I always heard the wonders of nature of India but never got chance to experience
  it before but this time in Chandigarh I got a chance to connect to the nature with
  all the people attached with the land the love they share..  The beauty of Amritsar
  can only be felt in the heart filled with such a peace, positivity .. The late night
  lighting of the golden temple it is just so mesmerising that I felt connected to
  self..  The peace and the connection with the god felt within my inner self..  Discovering
  that the place can be so beautiful with the farms so connected to nature..  Never
  thought that I would ever be able to enjoy nature but I felt like I loved nature
  as if I was again connected to nature
