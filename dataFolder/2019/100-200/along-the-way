Text: One at a time travelling around the world woman. The places she have found with
  a loving attitude and compassion into reality in Bydgoszcz Poland, each day passing
  through like a wind with a gentle mist in the soul that makes everyone's hearts
  desire come true. Walking through the path of each narrow edges on the street was
  calming and peaceful. Start your morning coffee that they call "kawa" and a slice
  of cheese and sumptuous bread will give you the best kick and energy that will flow
  in your veins. The birds are flying up high and will started to take a little dip
  in the open water, lovely birds are humming, very gentle lullubyes like   flowing
  river endlessly that's gives life.
