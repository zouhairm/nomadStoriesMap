Text: "Closing my eyes, I look deep inside.\nA journey, I have yet to find.\nToward\
  \ the heart I climb, meeting the Great Sorrows of time.\n\nI released the fear,\
  \ of bringing Pain near,\nA journey into my heart.\n\nOne breath. Two. I see something\
  \ new.\nA feeling of Great Bliss comes upon me.\nLighter now. \n\nOne breath. Two.\
  \ I'm coming closer to You.\nA feeling of Great Unity beholds me.\nFreer now.\n\n\
  I am One with You, as You are me.\nThrough Our Lives we See.\nTogether We Are Free.\n\
  \nA journey to the Universal Core,\nWalking our Great Truth to the Shore.\nOur Minds\
  \ much more Certain than Before.\n\nYour Heart Weaves with Mine,\nGreat Beauty Undefined,\n\
  A journey, that We forever Climb.\nTo Meet Eternal Sublime.\n\nI open my eyes.\n\
  to the Universe I am tied.\n\nI look to the skies, and with a great surprise\nI\
  \ am empty of the World once Despised.\n\nClear Heart. Strong Mind. \nI am a being\
  \ that's undefined.\n\nInfinite Light. Infinite Sight.\nA Meaning that is so Beautifully\
  \ Bright.\n\nI thank the Earth. I thank the Sun.\nI thank the Creator, from where\
  \ my Life Begun.\n\nOne Breath. Two.\nI am One with You. \nThe Journey could last\
  \ a Lifetime."
