Text: "I am writing about the state of Kashmir, as I wanted to see what the Himalayas\
  \ were all about, what Kashmiri food tasted like and what were the local people\
  \ about. A lot of bad has been written about that state but I want to see for myself\
  \ and experience everything from the weather to the local cuisine to the interaction\
  \ with the people.\n We landed in Srinagar and then went on to other cities or districts\
  \ such as Gulmarg, Yoesmarg. We hired a car and we drove around stopping at hotels\
  \ overnight,we always wanted to be in a bed n breakfast set up since we don't have\
  \ to look around for breakfast early in the morning the weather can get very brutal\
  \ suddenly.  Our Driver pretty much became part of the family much early on in the\
  \ tour.  His name is Majid Bhai.  Right from having a overnight romantic stay at\
  \ the house boat on Nagin lake,  to going on horseback in Yoesmarg, and walking\
  \ in knee length snow in Gulmarg. Our trip to Kashmir was truly magical with the\
  \ ending at the majestic Shalimar Bagh and the tulip gardens of India in Srinagar."
