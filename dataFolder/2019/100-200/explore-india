Text: "I visited Pakistan without knowing what to expect but my experience was amazing.\
  \ I loved the local food and people welcoming and wanting to express there gratitude\
  \ for visiting and trusting their country after all the negative media reports.\
  \ I was travelling alone on local transport I was shocked to see the respect the\
  \ people had for women but yet on social media there\u2019s so much negativity.\
  \ I was able to visit the beautiful Sikh Temples that\u2019s where now taken care\
  \ of by the local people. For years and years the Muslims have with pride and respect\
  \ looked after the Sikh temples in Pakistan they even celebrate the Sikh festivals,\
  \ yet for years there\u2019s been a mis-conception of Sikhs and Muslims being enmities.\
  \ I\u2019m quite proud that the local people of both country\u2019s enjoy living\
  \ in the mixed neighbourhoods and share love and celebrate festivals together! It\u2019\
  s a shame that there is so much negativity in the media. People of both countries\
  \ suffered equally at the time of the partition there\u2019s mixed feelings. It\
  \ was great to see the entertainment on the borders of these countries they make\
  \ it come yo life."
