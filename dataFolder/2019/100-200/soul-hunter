Text: In this world what inspires me is not material, but the people I meet in my
  way, in my travels, what they make me feel and what they give me of knowledge about
  what they do interesting in the place where they live. That's how in 2012 I met
  3 amazing personalities from Istanbul in Turkey. A fashion designer, an actress
  and a traditional Turkish music band mixed with pop rock. each of them with their
  particularities and not because they are famous, but because they are interesting
  souls that made me see the Turkish culture on another level, taking away my basic
  western vision and showing me that through the local cultures, there are fantastic
  souls who do not they seek only to satisfy the ego but to show their history, their
  soul and culture. It was beautiful days with these people experiencing the local
  cuisine in their favorite places as well as experiencing the work developed by them
  in that society. it was very good to feel the true local citizens in a transparent
  and true way.
