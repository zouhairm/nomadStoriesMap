Text: Well I am 21 year boy from India stuck at a place it's my passion to explore
  world and travel everywhere and get to know the culture and the interesting things
  about people places but I never have opportunity to go outside out of my country
  so I usually travel in nearby States they is so many interesting things I am kinda
  solo Traveller and and I first saw this and I couldn't believe that  could be I
  will have opportunity to being a professional traveler because it's very tough when
  you are love your requirements and also chasing your dreams because to being a professional
  Traveller in a beginning need money and waiter job in filling up all the requirements
  you have lessons like for 15 to 20 days that you will get off to be somewhere and
  explor.
