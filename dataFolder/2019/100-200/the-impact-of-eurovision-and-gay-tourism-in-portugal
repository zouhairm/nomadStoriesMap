Text: "This will be an adventure of the Anglo Saxon in Latino culture. A story about\
  \ a young gay activist finding out about the norms and allure of young lgbt people\
  \ to the vibrant metropolis of Lisbon. \n\nI want to connect with a local and find\
  \ out what it\u2019s like to grow up in Portugal, a highly catholic country, and\
  \ the experiences they faced in society. It is a passion of mine to meet new people\
  \ and experience new cultures so I want to connect my life story to that of other\
  \ cultures and discover the attraction from all over the world as to why Portugal\
  \ is such a gay destination in the 21st century.\n\nI will endeavor to experience\
  \ the lgbt events in the city, it\u2019s nightlife, sexual culture and nudist beaches\
  \ to write a travel article more personal and enriching than the average holiday\
  \ travel piece. I will find out how stigmas are perceived and how the opportunity\
  \ of being lgbt impacts local people. What does his mean for our societies and what\
  \ can we learn back home."
