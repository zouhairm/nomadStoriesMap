Text: "I have never dreamed to see India, but it happened. One day my friend said\
  \ to pack my bags and we went to India. Nothing happens in life without a cause.For\
  \ some reason it is necessary for you. Incredible India shocked me in the beginning\
  \ and in loved me by the end.\nThis inexplicable feeling of love made me completely\
  \ happy. There is no chance not to come back again and again.\nThe unique smell\
  \ of spices ,noise ,din and etc. It is different smell for everybody. The children\
  \ sincerely smile to you and adults moving their heads are always says to you yes.\n\
  When problems come they dance and they are always happy itself. \nOnce I made a\
  \ an jump in unknown world and now I spend winters here.The world where are the\
  \ people not in hurry and don\u2019t run anywhere. \nAnyway you can\u2019t explain\
  \ why you love ,you just love.You need to explore it by yourself.\nYou live only\
  \ once, don\u2019t waste your time. Travel and explored the world.Make experience\
  \ and change the world for the better! Find you own paradise and be happy!"
