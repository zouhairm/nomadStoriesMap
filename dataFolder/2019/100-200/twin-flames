Text: My aunt wrote Eat Pray Love and was the head of writing at UCLA for many years.
  She mentored me in my writing and I have decided to spend my 40th birthday at the
  ashram Where She Went. It was a story about her life and Julia Roberts played her.
  I turned 40 this June and I'm going to recreate her journey through my eyes and
  my experiences to meet her Guru at the ashram she stayed at many years ago. I also
  recently found out who I thought was my birth mother is not and the discovery of
  finding that out would be a thread through my journey of traveling through Europe
  and ending up in India at the original ashram my aunt went to and inspired the movie
  and novel Eat Pray Love! I'm a firm believer in that books are far better than the
  movies and I think my aunt would agree!
