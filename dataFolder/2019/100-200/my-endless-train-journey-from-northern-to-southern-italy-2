Text: 'I''ve used to do a lot of train journeys from Bologna (where I studied) to
  Bari (where I live), and vice-versa.

  I''ve never got bored, however, because every single travel gives me different sensation
  watching the myriad of towns that I could see through the train windows. Over the
  months and years, I''m starting to consider myself as a "citizen" of those towns,
  I recall some particular buildings and imagine their history, or how life could
  have been there.

  For example, I will never forget the colorful houses in Marche region, near Recanati,
  or the endless green fields of Pianura Padana, or the sea in Abruzzo, so close to
  the train window that sometimes I''ve thinked that I can dive in! And sometimes
  I imagined how could be the life in that narrow street in Molise, or which are the
  typical products in that Apulian market. I also imagined myself there, in that places
  that I''ve seen many times from a windows and that become, journey after journey,
  mine.

  In the end, every single travel became a travel into myself.'
