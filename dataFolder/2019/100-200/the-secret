Text: "TREKKING INTO HIDDEN TOWN NEAR A BEACH,  LOOKING FOR A PINCH OF SNOW IN THE\
  \ AREA OF HEAT. WITH NO KNOWLEDGE PF THE LOCAL LANGUAGE WE MANAGE TO REACH THE PLACE.\
  \ \nTHE PLACE WAS NOT SO FAMOUS SO THERE WERE NOT A LOT OF AMENITIES , THERE WERE\
  \ NO CAFES OR HOTELS ,INFACT THERE WAS NO NETWORK . IT FELT LIKE I WAS BACK IN TIME\
  \ WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT EXPOSED TO THE VASTNESS OF THE WORLD AND THERE I KNEW\
  \ THAT THEY KNEW THEMSELVES. THEY ARE SPENDING A LIFETIME WITH THE BEST OF NATURAL\
  \ RESOURCES AND A HANDFUL OF NATURE. \n\nTHE KNOWLEDGE I GAINED FROM SCHOOLS WAS\
  \ FAR LESS THAN THEIR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE. THEY WERE THE STUDENTS THAT NEVER STOPPED\
  \ LEARNING.  OUT IN URBAN PLACES WITH SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND US AND OUR FINGERTIPS\
  \ WE STILL FEEL LONE AND HERE ARE THEY WHO KNEW HOW TO ENJOY EVERYTHING THEY HAVE.\
  \ DESIRES WERE LESS AND THUS THE SORROWS. \n\nTHE PLACE WAS MUCH CLEANER THAN A\
  \ BUSY CROWDED CIVILISED AREA. \n\nPEOPLE WERE HEALTHIER WITH NO MEDICAL SUPPLIES.\
  \ \n\nHISTORY IS WHAT I LEARNT AND HOW SMART THEY ARE AND HOW DUMB WE ARE GETTING\
  \ IS WHAT THEY LEARNT."
