Text: I used to travel alone since I was 20 years old. In the beginning, it was not
  an option, but the only way that a single person that hates travel with groups,
  has found to do her trips. I discovered that travel by yourself is the best way
  to discover yourself and the best side that you like in some place... So, as a gastronomy,
  wine and art's lover, when I arrive in some place, I can discover all of these special
  places to attend all my desires! Its magical! I find places and know people that,
  as an angels, guide me to the right places and single situations... I love it! Everything
  is a big surprise! A guide that you write every day not with a pen, but with people
  and places...
