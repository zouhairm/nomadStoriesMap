Text: "Having lived in 4 countries I visited over 100. I am used to the unexpected.\
  \ Especially as a female going solo . From riding a motorbike onto a boat in Turkey\
  \ to being chased in Marrakesh. I have a few stories to tell. So this is a journey\
  \ into the unknown..\n\n A girl whose life has been lost in transit but given to\
  \ adventure.\n\n My unique spin is that I am also a photojournalist so my story\
  \ of the adventures and the amazing people I have met along the way is also all\
  \ captured on camera. Lives lived through my lens on the world. Sharing their journeys\
  \ and stories.."
