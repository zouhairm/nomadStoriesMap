Text: To what do I owe the pleasure of a leap into the unknown. For my eyes see flakes
  of white and my ears hear nothing but the wind. Cold crisp air ravishing against
  my cheek. To a place yet to explore I find myself wondering deep into the white
  blanket. A consistent pace of footsteps in the snow, finding myself at the foot
  of the path ending. Views so beautifully devastating my eyes take it in all to see.
  Crisp like the morning air people skate on the lake. What a beautiful time of year
  it is! As I breathe out hot air turns into unique dancing crystals falling to the
  ground. Cold. With nothing but my camera and my pack that holds my pen and paper
  I ponder what I shall stumble upon next. In this great adventure into the white
  unknown.
