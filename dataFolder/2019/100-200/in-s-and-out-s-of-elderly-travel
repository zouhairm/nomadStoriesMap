Text: 'In their travels Ed and May found that their itinerary research had to be more
  details because of their mobility issues.  Stairs and bathrooms were the enemy.  Ed
  usually was Mr. Macro and May Ms. Micro in their fact finding.  They used reviews
  to start but knew they could be padded. They used their Skype credit to call resort
  and hotels on their facilities. Usually Airbnb was out because of the stairs and

  at the Medicare literature for information but they were seasoned travelers with
  new limited issues: mobility and medicines.'
