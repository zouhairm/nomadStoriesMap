Text: "I stopped. I looked around. I noticed. Life is so unique that we should take\
  \ every opportunity of life and learn from each one of them. Travelling has always\
  \ been the best option of life! As a professional storyteller and photographer,\
  \ my passion for the world is inexplicable. To meet new people, places and cultures\
  \ is the bridge to knowledge and wisdom of the human being! \nWalking around the\
  \ world, I encounter countless people. People who, in the simplicity of a look,\
  \ a conversation or a culture, presents us the same world from another perspective,\
  \ where even the dry autumn leaves fallen on the floor of a plaza in the center\
  \ of a village, makes you see the beauty of life. And so we walk the world, because\
  \ never a story like this will end. \n\nBut we will realize that the world is much\
  \ bigger than you think and can gives you much more than you can possibly imagine."
