Text: 'I was born and raised in Indonesia, an archipelago in Southeast Asia. For the
  most part of my life, I live in Indonesia; but once a while I travel to other countries.
  From my travels, I found that Indonesia is a truly melting pot gastronomically,
  and linguistically.

  Indonesia was once a trading hub after the fall of Constantinople which attracted
  traders from Europe, Mediteranean, and other parts of the world. And the traders
  brought over piece of their culture over the ocean.

  There is this region in East Indonesia that has snack called Panada. Panada is not
  too far from the spanish delicacy Empanada.

  And you can find Panada just everwhere: from a fancy baker to Pasar.

  Pasar is Indonesian word that derived from arabic Bazaar. In english, it is market.

  There are lot more example I could mention about how culture is essentially shaped
  from collective human interactions. And I would not even noticed the similarities
  if I decided not to explore the world.'
