Text: This story starts from 2013 when I was in school all my friends were so rich
  they use to go to abroad for vacation where use to see the pics when they used to
  ask me why dont you go my answer was not interested but fact was I cant afford one
  my biggest dream was travelling in a flight to abroad I started saving for that
  worked hard did small working and finally after four long year I took a flight from
  banglore to kochi I was the most happiest person when I made it now after saving
  somuch I got the passport a month back now saving money for my dream trip this is
  not a story life of a middle class boy
