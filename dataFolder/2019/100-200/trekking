Text: I've been trekking for many time in the same place that I know a lot to go but
  I never found the most beautiful path that leads me in to the unknown place hidden
  underground on that place that I've been many times before but now its shocked me
  like I step into the tails of a snake , today I found a new cave hidden somewhere
  in the unknown place and It was really beautiful cave never ever found before .
  it's was not long enough though about one or half kilo meters away from the entrance
  but believe me it was beautiful cave . you will never found if you go alone its
  was hidden . it have many treasure into that cave maybe its the ancient people's
  live I'm that before its was untouch or maybe never not to touch anything in that
  cave .
