Text: "As a immigrant from Pakistan to Indonesia, i am in love with travel and exploring\
  \ world but due to raised in middle class family and not having enough money i am\
  \ still struggling for my dream. I don\u2019t miss any opportunity for winning a\
  \ trip to a new country. \nI would like to write a story about peace and people\
  \ of our era , that how and why is chaos in the world these days why the word peace\
  \ seems to be removed from our dictionary? What\u2019s the reason and who\u2019\
  s responsible for it? Because my English is not that good I would like to write\
  \ in urdu or Arabic and then my American friend will translate my story in to English.\
  \ I request you to give me an opportunity so i can see the world. Thanks"
