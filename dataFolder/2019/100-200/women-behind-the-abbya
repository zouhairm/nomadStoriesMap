  \ and why saudi. Honestly I was never interested, internet stories scared me. But\
  \ now living coming from India, it\u2019s been 5 yrs. And I am actually in love\
  \ with this place, everything about there culture and living style is interesting.\
  \ Here women has to wear abbya, black coat, some of them cover there head and face\
  \ also, but then they are much educated. You will find them everywhere, hospitals,\
  \ education sectors, business enterprises.....all women\u2019s here are setting\
  \ an example of following there culture as well as staying connected with new technologies.\
  \ Even in the world of fashion, they are marvelous, they keep them self up to date,\
  \ shopping is there most favorite hobby. Worlds most expensive brands are here and\
  \ they just love shopping 365 days. Saudi women are setting examples for the world\
  \ for its intelligence and beauty standards. They perform every role of being an\
