Text: "Connections are just waiting around the corner\nAt a coffee shop table across,\
  \ maybe a cute foreigner\nbut does not always have to be the romcom clich\xE8 genre\n\
  eyes met, lips locked, putting a story of love together\nit can turn into tale of\
  \ connections much warmer\nlasting years without a word uttered \nbut meeting everytime\
  \  like the time gone by never mattered\nWe banter for hours about how love interwines\
  \ in our eats, movies, music, prayers and lovers \nand find it more so interesting\
  \ in cultures of each other\nneed not end as a superficial social millennial phrase\
  \ #forever\nbut garner more pages in your book called Survivor\nmaking you wiser\
  \ by every chapter\nyou realise we are just as good as its curator"
