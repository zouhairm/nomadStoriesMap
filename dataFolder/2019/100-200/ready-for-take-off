Text: "I had been to South Goa.From there I took a road trip to go Karna which took\
  \ me 4 hours. There I visited Om beach and it was so peaceful and it was perfect\
  \ getaway. I met some foreigners who stay there and work to survive on that beach.\
  \ They'd been staying there for month. I saw their fire show which was spectacular.\
  \ They work in restaurant or show their talent, by doing so they earn some amount\
  \ of money which help them continue their trip.it was pretty much excited. It needs\
  \ guts to follow passion of traveling around the world and do whatever it takes.\
