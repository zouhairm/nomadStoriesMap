Text: 'I have travelled to Portugal 4 times already! And loved it everytime! My 1st
  visit to the country was in 2015, right after I had done an exhibition for my clothing
  Brand. I had such an inspiring time away, and was able to come up with fresh new
  ideas for my projects! I came up with a name I didn''t realise would be so controversial
  and with my experiences from time spent in Portugal I was able to come up with a
  name that would carry the same message but in a different language ''the Portuguese
  language'' So as you can see I have a very fond connection with this beautiful country.
  I travelled to Germany in 2001 (visited 3 cities: frankfurt, Rostock & Halle) Greece,
  Crete in 2006 and the USA, Miami in 2008 .. I love to travel and unfortunately haven''t
  been to loads of places but Portugal is definitely my fav! I am and have always
  been a passionate writer and reader; So winning this would be a dream come true!'
