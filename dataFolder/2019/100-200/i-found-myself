Text: "With the suitcase in hand and heading to the airport, I find my self starting\
  \ a new adventure, one that may change my life. This is how I feel every time I\
  \ decide to embark again on a trip. Sometimes I feel that I need it, to travel,\
  \ I think. Others, I wonder if I'll have enough day. Right in that little instant,\
  \ I see myself packing my suitcase again. Planning where to go and without even\
  \ thinking about what I would find, I find myself. I find what is usually called\
  \ happiness, but it is not a short instant of happiness, it remains with me along\
  \ the trip and stays with me in that Caff\xE9 with my friends. And there, I reaffirm\
  \ myself once again, I'm a travel enthusiast, I enjoy sharing moments, experiences\
  \ and mingle with locals and above all, I love how travelling to an unknown place\
  \ makes me feel."
