Text: Hi,My travel story started with dump by my friend. We are planning trip to dharmshala
  and mcleodganj, Himachal Pradesh, india.We are dreaming like so much fun and enjoy
  during trip because this is our first trip together. One night before my friend
  call me and say "hay brother I am not coming", I said ok no problem. He say "you
  trevel alone", I said "yes", this my first alone trip ever start. My mother and
  father worried about me but I decided let's enjoy trip alone. I stated trip from
  jaipur to Delhi and I reached early morning delhi. 6 O'clock morning bus departure
  from Delhi to dharmshala,himachal Pradesh. Finally journey started and I am excited,then
  some time to go bus conductor come to me and say your ticket not valid, I am shocked,
  I say "this is online booking ticket and I have my ticket" but doesn't understand
  than he say ok you pay extra cost for bus ticket because fair has increased and
  not interested for paying extra money than we kick outside the bus. So,I decid not
  take stress given him money what thay want. I am started journey like this to dharmshala.
