Text: "The country that set out to discover the rest of the world by sea has a long\
  \ history of people who loved adventure and reinvention.  I long to immerse myself\
  \ in this diverse country\u2019s  lush history, architecture, seaside recreations,\
  \ culinary artistry, and exceptional wine tastings. I hope to learn about it\u2019\
  s vast history and to experience its modern wonders.  I long to listen to Portugal\u2019\
  s  cultural contributions in it\u2019s  musical past and experience it's new contemporary\
  \ music creations.  I hope to be inspired by the architecture, art museums, and\
  \ vast collection of literary historical artifacts.  I hope to create an entertaining\
  \ and joyful compendium of daily finds akin to the French version of \u201DA Year\
  \ in Provence\u201D.  I hope to learn from the Portuguese people and to share my\
  \ experiences and discoveries with others across the globe."
