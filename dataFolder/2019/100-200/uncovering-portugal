Text: Starting wi th my first trip to Rajasthan being in northern state in India.
  My first travelling spot being Jaisalmer. Traditional state of India where people
  are so connected with each other, we stayed at fort one of the most beautiful place,
  they have construction of decades ago which they are still embracing. They being
  so natural and kind to people who visit them as they could keep their ancestors
  alive by following their tradition. We visited many spiritual places like Jain Temples,
  Church. These spiritual places being their decades ago which could bring their spiritual
  soul in to peace. Then we headed towards sand dunes Jaisalmer. We have this iconic
  ride on camel, i got to find find camel do have racing. Then by evening we all got
  to sit and relax in and enjoy the tradition folk dance of these beautiful and very
  talented people. Finally while driving back to home we could experience the calmness
  and beautiful view of sand dunes which will stay in my hear forever.
