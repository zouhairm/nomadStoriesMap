Text: "I was at a dark place I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do... so I met this\
  \ guy on instagram and he had a neat idea of flying across the world to London and\
  \ go backpacking and see how long we last. Little did we know as soon as I got there\
  \ we had no plans at all... soo the first thing we did is take a bus to the middle\
  \ of London and planned out what we were going to do.... first walk around and take\
  \ pictures during the night, book a hostel and then go to stone henge for the longest\
  \ \u201Cday\u201D in Europe.. but that night changed our perspective on our adventure\
  \ the following morning we decided to take the next plane out to anywhere in Europe\
  \ and enjoy our selfs... you know living on the edge because that\u2019s we are\
  \ trying put out there for people to be a bit more spontaneous!"
