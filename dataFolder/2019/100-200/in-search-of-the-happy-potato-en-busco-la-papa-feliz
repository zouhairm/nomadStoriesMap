Text: "It is a story of two friends from the North Europe backpacking in Peru, hiking\
  \ for 15 days starting from the Amazon selva up in to the Andean ridge, meeting\
  \ the locals and more, far away from traditional touristic tracks.\nA potato is\
  \ a symbol. It has spread all around the World with the people and Peru is considered\
  \ to be it's homeland with about 2500 edible species growing there.\nA country with\
  \ the Sun (Sol) as its symbol, present in the flag, name of currency, capital, etc.\
  \ has been home fur numerous tribes and civilisations, Inca being the most recognisable.\
  \ \nWas this all thanks to papas?"
