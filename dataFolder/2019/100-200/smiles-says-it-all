Text: "The sounds of animals, cock, horn, cow, goat. The sounds of Adzan (Islamic\
  \ signs praying), \nThe sounds of people go to market.\nAll these morning fresh\
  \ vibes made me woke up with hope. \nTake my phone as tool to make all these memories.\
  \ \nThose smiles of locals, makes all these activities are alive well. \nI woke\
  \ up in Yogyakarta. The cultural and most historical city in Indonesia. \nAs known\
  \ as best education city in Indonesia, not only for that the warmest and most peaceful\
  \ of social life. Supported also by all the environment and beautiful spots that\
  \ can't get much more enough to explore in this city. \nYogyakarta is always be\
  \ in heart for everyone."
