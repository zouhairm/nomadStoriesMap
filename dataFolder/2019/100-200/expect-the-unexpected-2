Text: "Life is unexpected and uncertain on every breath. Live it as ot comes and where\
  \ it takes us. We don't know where this journey of life will take us even though\
  \ we plan every second, such is the irony of life. Blame it on destiny or karma,\
  \ who knows God exist or doesn't exist. \n\nMy way of travelling is where the road\
  \ of journey takes me to. I never plan my holidays it's always unplanned. The essence\
  \ of travelling lies in exploring the local places, meeting local people and get\
  \ to know what the place offers. Mingling with the localities is the best way to\
  \ know the insights of a place. \n\nTravelling helps you grow and realise that life\
  \ is beyond comforts and staying in luxuries or even without the basics of life.\
  \ It teaches us to grow mentally,  emotionally, physically and mainly financially.\
  \ It helps in overall growth of a human being.\n\nTravelling makes us cover the\
  \ leap of unknown to known. Every new place visited is unknown unless explored.\
  \ Some people travel to explore and some travel to get explored. It's an experience\
  \ in itself where man learns how to coop with the unknowns in life."
