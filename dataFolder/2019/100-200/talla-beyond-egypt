Text: When I arrived to Egypt at 4 am to the hostel I heard a noise, what's going
  on here? There were a man out praying in the middle of the route, totally a revelation
  when I woke up the next morning I saw a lot of people, cars, people praying, smoke
  of shishas and noise everywhere. Delicious smell on the streets and close from my
  new house, I contemplated the greatest Nile river, great stories through the time
  and I was just there wondering how the entire Egyptian empire began, the wonders
  they built and how many people suffered to create such beauty that we now admire.
  It is impressive the monumental temples but one of the things that I never spect
  was to climb a mountain at night just for see the sunrise, that feeling of peace
  and quiet there were just the view of desert mountains and my mind, breathe take
  your time to enjoy the moment be grateful with the beauty of nature. The places
  are incredible but the happy people who share the same ideals make the experience
  unique.
