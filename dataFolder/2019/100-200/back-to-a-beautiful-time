Text: "Portugal, such a chilled country. From south to north you feel the difference\
  \ but still, everyone is relaxed and no yelling or fighting to find. \nLast December\
  \ I was lucky enough to make a whole country round trip, I got to see the beautiful\
  \ landscapes in the south. The unbelievable beaches and big rocks sitting by the\
  \ coast to the Enormous cliffs with a light blue colour for water. The sea just\
  \ looked like a perfect painting.\nAnother thing to fall in love with, was the delicious\
  \ food and their small snacks. Best way to enjoy them, is to go to a local busy\
  \ shop, and eat in that small crowded place. \nPortugal is Alive, very alive \n\
  I wish to go back there again, it has such vibes no other country has \nIt\u2019\
  s a Southern European one, but nothing like Spain or Italy. The people are just\
  \ so relaxed, I found myself getting impatient a lot though. So I believe every\
  \ one of us need to go there and spend some time to learn how to live life again."
