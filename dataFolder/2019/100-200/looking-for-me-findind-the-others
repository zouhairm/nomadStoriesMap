Text: Sometimes you just want to be apart, to keep your eyes far from your routine
  and job. I was needing to find myself. I was lost in meetings and papers. I thought
  in meditation, on a landscape that could make me just relax and forget. However,
  a trip doesn't have to obey any of our selfish desires... In the streets of India
  the crowd had catch me. All that colors, all the warm, all that cauldron of beliefs
  and noises... All that humanity. To look for me was the priority, in silence and
  peace, maybe in a temple. But it didn't happen. The temple is the world, the cries
  for help are made of many sounds of smilling and crying children, the priest is
  the landscape who shows us who we are:humans. Humans that need the colour's variety,
  the smelling variety and to see the many kinds to look for happiness. Looking for
  me, I saw the others, and I liked that.
