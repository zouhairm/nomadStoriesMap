Text: "My friend and I got some extra days off at work so we decided to travel \n\
  Randomly I said Greece she was agreed with my decision \nWe made a plan of whole\
  \ places we would like to visit \nSo far our favorite were Zakynthos island \nEspecially\
  \ Navagio beach \nAnd then after 10 days trip we got back home \nI got some memories\
  \ in Facebook 3 years ago and the post was me tagged my friend on the picture with\
  \ exactly same place which we are just visited and I mentioned there one day we\
  \ will be there ...\nSo simple everything starts with a wish and then dreams come\
  \ true \nI even didn\u2019t remember anymore about that post but it happened anyway\
  \ \nJust keep dreaming and you will get to the sky"
