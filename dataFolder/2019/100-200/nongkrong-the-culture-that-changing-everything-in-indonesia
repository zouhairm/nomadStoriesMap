Text: "nongkrong means \u201Cto meet and talk, and smoke for some\u201D. But nongkrong\
  \ is basically about talking and talking with people we\u2019re close with. In nongkrong,\
  \ people talk everything; school, economy, relationship, discuss, political issues,\
  \ and other tipics. Some might nongkrong to talk about something important, but\
  \ trust me, it usually lasts only the first hour. The following hours will be about\
  \ who\u2019s got a new girlfriend or where the new cool place to hang out is. But,\
  \ it could be different when we looking nongkrong in economic perspective. Nongkrong\
  \ adopted by 7 eleven to be their bussines model, and developing 7 eleven with Indonesian\
  \ style."
