Text: "Travel to find peace within the soul. A stumble across so much more than you\
  \ could ever imagine could be real in life. A truethful and powerful love story\
  \ of kindled spirits that keep continuing to find eachother in he world but also\
  \ keep getting pulled apart by other universal needs. The story of seeking truth\
  \ in the adventures of the soul and why we do what we do in life. Unravelling indias\
  \ mysteries in religion love yoga and union. The power of wisdom love and the eternal\
  \ devotion to the gods that rule over us. \n\nAn exploration of earth culture and\
  \ the species that inhabit this planet"
