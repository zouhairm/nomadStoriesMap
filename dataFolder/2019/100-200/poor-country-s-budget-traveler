Text: 'Travelling to new destination is always a favourite things for human,even its
  for Rich people or for a poor people . I also have a same dream to travel new destination
  everytime but its hard for many reason if you are not well rich or from not a rich
  country . I was in poor familiy on the world second pooriest country Nepal''s poor
  village of Amalachour. I family also not well rich and we have 50K$ loan too.

  This is a story from my first foreign trip to Singapore. I was there 2 years ago
  for a first time. And I found its too bore to cross immigration .first my own country
  Nepal immigration stop me for 1 hours and after reach in singapore also they stop
  me entry singaoore for 3 hour. After singapore I visit more 30 country like this
  carrying a poor passport . I have lots of hidden story during my travelling .'
