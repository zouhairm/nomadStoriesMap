Text: 'I''m a young college student active on social media, and I''ve seen what travelling
  has become for young American adults in 2019. Travelling the world has become a
  show, a brag, an excuse to get drunk off the drink the country''s known for. And
  yes, getting drunk is fun, especially in a new country with other drunk friends
  and locals surrounding you. But many college students studying abroad and narrow-minded
  people have missed the immersion into a different culture, the leap into the unknown,
  the expansion of the mind. Visiting a country foreign to you can alter the brain
  and create a completely new perspective.

  As someone with a Jewish background, I emotionally connected with the citizens of
  Israel when I visited. I''m atheist, and not believing in God could have prevented
  me from finding my place in Israel. I thought of my family, I learned about the
  lives of the people in Israel, and I found a place. For ethnocentric tourists and
  a decent amount of college students studying abroad, travelling has lost its connection
  to the culture and the people that culture belongs to.'
