Text: "Travelling to an unknown place alone was intimidating for me. But when I decided\
  \ to take a flight there was no going back. Kuala Lumpur was my destination. A lively\
  \ city of skyscrapers, amazing food and diverse cultures is what I found. \n\nIt\
  \ was scary at first. It was just me walking around with a camera in my hands until\
  \ I found out how friendly the locals are and how much they value their guests.\
  \ I explored the city's most famous tourist places but one night I will always remember\
  \ is when I went to a bar called \"The Sphere\" in Bangsur south. It was when I\
  \ truly blended with the locals, hung with the live musicians and made some friends.\
  \ The vibe of the place was so good that it made to the top of my list of what I\
  \ loved about the city."
