Text: "I am a Chinese American, and whenever I see Asian American travelers, especially\
  \ Chinese travelers, they're always in tour groups. They spend about 20 minutes\
  \ at each site and then spend the majority of their time in gift shops and Chinese\
  \ restaurants. They do this because their economy and culture enables this kind\
  \ of traveling. Most of the time, Chinese travelers can only obtain vacation Visa's\
  \ if they apply with a tour group. So if they want to vacation outside of China,\
  \ they're locked into this kind of travel scenario. There are few Chinese travel\
  \ agencies within and outside of China that emphasize actually getting to know a\
  \ place and it's people. \n\nI think my travelogue can provide a different kind\
  \ of perspective and open up more travel groups from China to Portugal, which would\
  \ be a huge boon for Portugal since China has become one of the top countries for\
  \ travel abroad."
