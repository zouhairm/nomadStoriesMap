Text: '5 years ago, I was drowning in pain, I was full of negative thoughts and regrets.


  We all have a dark story that doesn''t want to be told, but mine makes me open my
  eyes and dive into my deepest fears and dreams


  One day I start my awareness of myself and discover my potential as a human being,
  and the most exciting part is that you have just the same inner power to achieve
  your goals and let the world how you did it.


  I have changed my body, I''m changing my mind, and of course my reality.


  Now it''s time to go outside the box, to jump the seas and being a new journey'
