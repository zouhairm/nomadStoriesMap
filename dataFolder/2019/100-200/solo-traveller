Text: "It was my first trip to Bangkok, Capital of Thailand, with my friends. It was\
  \ my best trip as compared to other countries. When I reached their airport (Suvarnabhumi\
  \ Airport), I was amazed that the new airport was so beautiful and the interior/exterior\
  \ designs for the whole airport were simply impressive. I couldn\u2019t resist myself\
  \ but to take out my LC-A+ and have a few shots there.\n\nTook a cab to my hotel\
  \ which is located near Chit Lom (an area located in Bangkok where you can find,\
  \ lots of shopping malls, congested traffic, roadside hawker, places for hangover\
  \ and the nightlife of bangkok). What I saw from my eyes were wires and lamp post\
  \ all over the city and of course human traffic! It was really an eye opener for\
  \ me to see all those things that I couldn\u2019t see it in my own country."
