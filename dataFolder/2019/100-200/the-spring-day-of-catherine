Text: "Catherine didn't say any word. But, her eyes did. She had flowers in her head\
  \ and from her heart blossomed the most beautiful smiles. It was Spring Day, the\
  \ day when joy fulfilled of color the brownish streets of Kliptown. Catherine wasn't\
  \ expecting visits, but she didn't think twice to invite me to celebrate. The old\
  \ lady was an immense field of stories to harvest. However, neither she or I were\
  \ worried about picking flowers from the past. In the courtyard of her face brick\
  \ walls' house, she offered the best drink she had: some wine with coke. During\
  \ our conversation, Catherine wanted to try my red lipstick. And so she did. Now,\
  \ she had the most colorful smile of the neighborhood. For 46 years - of her 72\
  \ - she hadn\u2019t been able to enjoy the diversity of flora - not even in spring\
  \ days. The Apartheid's fields weren't colorful. But now her life has no fences\
  \ anymore. And she is allowed to paint all the colors. Black and white became the\
  \ mixture of our warmful hugs. The multicolored seeds of equality bloomed as she\
  \ said: Goodbye, I love you!"
