Text: When i was fifteen i traveled to Israel alone to live an israeli life. I lived
  in a house of an indian family who lives in there. I slept in an antibomb room.
  The family did not treat me well so I was going to visit museums once the school
  finished. I knew my past history and discovered a lot of that country, I wrote stories
  and poems to express everything wonderful that I saw. fill my soul with impressive
  historical places and memories besides learning an autonomy that until that moment
  I did not know, English became my ally but I discovered a group of Brazilians with
  whom we solved everything in Portuguese. an experience full of emotions and landscapes
  of all kinds in addition to much culture that to this day mark my life.
