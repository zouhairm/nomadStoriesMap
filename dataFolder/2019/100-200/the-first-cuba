Text: There are only two places on planet Earth named Cuba. Cuba, the Island on the
  Caribean sea, and Cuba, a little town on the hart of Alentejo region, Portugal.
  There is a myth that Christoph Columbus was born in this Portuguese place. There
  are a movie and a book about it, but the locals and the historians do not put much
  credit on those. Anyway, the town deserves to be explored, not because Columbus
  might have been born there, but for the music, the food, and the typical architecture
  of white walls, white houses in blue skies, and all the light that hurts the eye.
  And more than that, there are the people, that don't care much about history, nor
  the explorers of the new worlds.
