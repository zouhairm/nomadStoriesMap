Text: I have alway wanted to go to Ireland; well last year I got to meet some friends
  from facebook.  I had won a trip on a gameshow; When the plane landed in Dunkirk;
  I was greeted by Ryan O'flanery and we rode his motorcycle all the way to Wexford.  I
  took many photos of the landscape.  I was imersed in Irish culture that night when
  we went to a bar.  I was talking to a local as I sat and had my whiskey; and i learned
  a great deal of her nation's rich history. She told me about the British occuption
  i the north; and i mentioned the embassy bombings of the 90s. I saw a snake when
  i lifted a rock, and then it was explained to me that was a euphimism.  I was wondering
  what it meant by St.Patrick drove all the snakes from Ireland.  I stayed in a hotel
  becaue they didn't have a spare bed   I went home with this woman named Rosey; and
  she let me sleep in her bed.    (please notice, this is a work of fiction)
