Text: 'a way to love and reward myself, is by going on an unknown journey and unfold
  the untold with thrill and surprises.


  It rains, it goes dark, its burning heat and its living out of your homes with all
  challenges every moment. Overcome single challenge rewards you immense strength
  and you relax on hard surface instead of bed of roses at your home.


  I might not be able to express but its lifetime experience mate :). You realise
  Unleashed strength inside you every moment and cherish the hardships thereafter.


  It is not important to win or loose, life is such a game which is important to played.'
