Text: "In many an international travel, the most significant thing that I experienced\
  \ was how people relate to Africa. Most people in the world remembers Mandela, but\
  \ 25 years on, one must understand Africa in relation to other cultures. The biggest\
  \ misconception one has is not understanding culture. The singular denominator between\
  \ cultures is being inquisitive. The word Ubuntu is one that unites cultures within\
  \ Africa. It would be interesting to see how far Ubuntu can go.\n\nThis is very\
  \ important given the colonial history of Portugal within Africa. People lack the\
  \ basic understanding of the different culture, and that we no longer live in such\
  \ an era. It's time the world experience Ubuntu as much as Africa n\xE8eds to mend\
  \ it's soul. \n\nKnowledge is a powerful tool when one seeks freedom."
