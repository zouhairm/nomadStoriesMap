Text: "Few days back i went to a place known as Banaras in India.\nSo the only reason\
  \ to visit Banaras to plan what to do in the future regarding the career. \nSo this\
  \ came to me while i was sitting on the banks of the Ganga river , smiled waved\
  \ and sat next to me.\nWe talked for a while , he asked me to accompany him to a\
  \ ride in the River.\nHe asked me to use my ears and body to feel things and asked\
  \ me to shut my eyes. \nWe started all this at 7pm IST and i understood many new\
  \ things around that time we travelled in the boat. \n2 hours of utmost realisation\
  \ of life and how people live there , meeting Aghories and other unknown stories\
  \ about how we dont even use all of our body parts in the whole day and are focused\
  \ more on what we see. \nThe self realisation and calming your body and midnd can\
  \ help achieve what new levels . \nMany new things were discovered just by calming\
  \ your mind and body."
