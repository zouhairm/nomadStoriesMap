Text: "The Glacier Express is a direct train from Zermatt to St. Moritz in Switzerland\
  \ and pass through beautiful scenes of nature. The train is also referred to as\
  \ the 'slowest express train in the world': the journey takes about 8 hours.The\
  \ route takes you through the three cantons of Valais, Uri and Graub\xFCnden, and\
  \ offers breathtaking and varied panoramic views. Eight hours of sheer pleasure\
  \ for your eyes and your palate, too. Of course, summer is a beautiful time too,\
  \ but it's quite touristy. I would not recommend the journey in March and April.\
  \ Although there are still masses of snow in higher regions - which is beautiful\
  \ - the lower regions of these route can still be a bit dreary with patches of snow\
  \ or bare grounds and leafless deciduous forests."
