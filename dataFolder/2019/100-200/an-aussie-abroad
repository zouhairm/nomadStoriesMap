Text: "Living abroad makes you feel like an outsider; Makes your life before seem\
  \ so distant; Makes you feel uncomfortable and sometimes you just don't feel like\
  \ yourself. You're growing, but in a direction you're not used to. Everything you\
  \ know is far away, like, your favourite restaurants, stores and products. Everyone\
  \ you know is far away and forming new friendships is actually a lot harder than\
  \ you'd expect.\n\nLiving abroad is an intense emotional rollercoaster. You may\
  \ not LOVE your new adopted country all the time and that's ok, just remind yourself\
  \ why you chose to move there in the first place. With all the challenges of moving\
  \ abroad and settling into a new country, there is no doubt that every bit of the\
  \ struggle is worth the result.\n\nLiving abroad changes you in ways that nothing\
  \ else can. Inside your comfort zone is a safe, but dangerous place. If you never\
  \ leave, you\u2019ll never change and you\u2019ll never become your very best self.\n\
  \nWhen you follow through on your dream of living abroad. When you put yourself\
  \ out there. Conquer your fears. Take on the unfamiliar. That's when the magic really\
  \ happens!"
