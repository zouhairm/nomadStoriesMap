Text: "As I have worked and travel to places as part of my work assignment, I found\
  \ this wonderful wandering as something I enjoy and love. \n\nGoing around, exploring\
  \ cities, lifestyle, architecture, monuments, people, transport (epecially public\
  \ transport), food etc on my trip was something I enjoyed. Ofcourse taking pictures\
  \ and memories along is also part of it, but the story behind every city, their\
  \ people, their monuments, their architecture, after all an answer to why it is\
  \ like that? - is something which is best part of travelling I feel. \nIt\u2019\
  s fun, it\u2019s lovely and something I enjoy. I can walk walk walk during my trips,\
  \ because it\u2019s travel trip for me and not a vacation to relax. I am collecting\
  \ all the memories along as I keep wandering."
