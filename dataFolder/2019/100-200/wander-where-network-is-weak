Text: "So you love the cozy comforts of your home?, my mind asked me, heart replied\
  \ yes,I do!,what's not to like?, I know how I have to survive,I can balance the\
  \ daily grind of life. Above all it's safe. Mind said it's been 2 years since you\
  \ stepped out really for you. \nWell,that was it,the inner turmoil had finally gave\
  \ in. I planned my trip to the rural Uttrakhand, it's a north state in India. I\
  \ had this place in my mind that I always wanted to travel,Bageshwar. Old temples,\
  \ where you can see the old craftsman work in the details . The serenity of the\
  \ mountains, I took a local bus, 8 hours away from New Delhi. I wandered into the\
  \ unknown, where only silence could reach."
