Text: "I came to Italy with the intention to assert my italian surname, and maybe\
  \ after fly for another country, where I could make a life, maybe a life without\
  \ money  problems. From the begginer I was nervous, I left a big life in my country,\
  \ and I wanted all with velocity here, but here nothing is like that, I discovered\
  \ new way to live, I learned what is to be calm and just wait, the famous \u201C\
  dolce far niente\u201D! And although this country doesn\u2019t give you the best\
  \ jobs, something holds you here, and not just for the \u201Ccarbonara\u201D or\
  \ \u201Cmargherita\u201D, is something about the air, about the sun, and specially\
  \ about the change inside of you. Isn\u2019t a easy life, will gonna fight against\
  \ a lot of problems, speacially a place where to live. But when you once under the\
  \ Tuscany sun you will be grateful for having tried, and you will discovered what\u2019\
  s like to live, and nothing is so hard if you have a \u201CChianti Wine\u201D with\
  \ you!"
