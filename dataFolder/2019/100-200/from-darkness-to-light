Text: "From darker areas of life i travelled to the brighter fantasies . From a small\
  \ slum area where life is so complicated and rough at every point u just want to\
  \ hate life why you born in this place . From there to the fantasies life like big\
  \ big buildings lavish life no diseases no overcrowding nuthing but all these things\
  \ can never fulfill the old happiness of togetherness where there is diseases but\
  \ people are there to look out and helping \u201Cleap to the unknown\u201Dplace\
  \ i think i might be everything is awsm but heart is only and only in earlier place\
  \ travelling from darker place to the light is like to moving from hell to heaven\
  \ but people who are living in hell are much better than heaven as they help each\
  \ other and as in new place no one bothering other just having there own work."
