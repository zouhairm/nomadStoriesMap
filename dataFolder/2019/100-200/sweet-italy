Text: 'I arrived in Italy Rome to be exact, the culture and the locals ways of life,
  love and fun lived up to everything I had heard that took me there. The Spanish
  steps and the underground was amazing but the coliseum was spectacular, everything
  I experienced was another chapter to my life.

  Next I went by train to Florence, I enjoyed the experience and found it easy to
  get around. Florence is a beautiful place with the amazing museums and their street
  markets kept me entertained for days. The outside restaurants were amazing and the
  food fantastic. I had an adventure well worth the amount I spent and now if off
  to plan my next adventure'
