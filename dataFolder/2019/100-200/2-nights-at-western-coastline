Text: It's a wonderful experience to share about one of the beautiful place in western
  coast line of India i.e Mangalore .Thinking that it would be one of the noisy City
  I entered it but was surprised to see that it was sthe cleanest and non polluted
  city .The ancient type of festival bhooota kola and huli kunitha was a completely
  new experience for us .The special type of food of dakshina kannada Mangalore buns
  was the best and it really makes our  mouth water even now .The trip to Mangalore
  was overall the best and me and my friends share a lot of good memories in that
  city and it's beaches
