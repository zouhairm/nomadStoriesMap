Text: My trips have alwaya been same . A long bus tour or by plane , lots of foods
  and sightseeing and maybe one or two friends who aren't so busy with their life
  like me . But one trip that made all the difference was my trip to Rishikesh in
  uttarakhand. Though it was my second time but believe me when i say this time was
  unforgettable because of ofcourse the company i ahd all the amzing stay out there
  , whole lotta musics and so many adventures . So it happened one night and very
  unplanned we went to check out a cafe which has all night live music and when we
  got there damn i felt like living again. I'm so grateful to be living and wondering
  and finding happiness in such small things.
