Text: Have you ever been in a place were the people and the streets of the city seems
  happy all the time? I was, and that place is the magical Portugal. I didn't expect
  to find that sensation there, but every step I toke was a new surprise. The colours
  and the art of the buildings, the people always in a good mood, the views of the
  city, the music everywhere and the amazing pastel de nata, will make your stay unforgettable.
  Be prepared to walk and go up stairs all the time but come on it's also good to
  your health and your soul.
