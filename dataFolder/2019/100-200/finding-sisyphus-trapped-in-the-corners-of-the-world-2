Text: I am looking to tell the tale of unknown ordinary people of every country, every
  time. The shopowners, the pavement dwellers, the homeless, the person having a home
  in his heart and especially artists and book shop-owners. One who is trapped in
  the travels of time and in their own craftiness. Trapped in their own ways and in
  their own way of living. Yet they still believe in their craft and always carry
  the baggage of that distant unknown dream which remains fulfilled in obscure buildings,
  old ways of transport and other such things who are breathing their las. My story
  will feature these people harboring this lost world in a modern city. A contrast,
  a deception, an oxymoron in their own right.
