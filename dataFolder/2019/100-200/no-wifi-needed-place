Text: Kampot was not in my plans...but life is luckily unpredictable and, obviously,
  meaningful! This charming town in the south of Cambodia makes you stop running for
  anything that doesn't make sense to live the present on every single way of the
  word. Here the time runs differently from what we are used to. Walk around the lovely
  colonials buildings and listen to several stories from friendly locals who are really
  happy to share their culture with. During my stay there I met Gunthea, a khmer girl
  from Phnom Pehn, who moved into Kampot exactly because of it's peaceful vibes. Silent
  on your phone and be open to whatever comes from this magical place...undoubtedly
  you will have an amazing time there! At least a zen one with spectaculars sunsets...
