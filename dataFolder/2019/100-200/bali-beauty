Text: "In 2009, I had some amazing life changes occur.  I ended a longterm relationship,\
  \ while living in New York, and was in need of a scenery change.  A friend mentioned\
  \ that a mutual acquaintance was needing healing with her Bali company, and would\
  \ I consider going to Bali, to work for a few months.  I went, worked a lot, and\
  \ once my contract ended, I decided to stay longer in order to experience Bali properly.\
  \  That\u2019s when something magical happened, I fell in love with Bali, all of\
  \ her beauty.  The local culture, the cuisine, the many many Hindu ceremonies, and\
  \ endless sunsets.  I want to be able to experience other locations in the world,\
  \ as I have been fortunate enough to have had in Bali.\n\nMs Monica\n[email\_protected]\n\
