Text: My story begins with a family story. As a true Brazilian, my ancestors were
  European, Indigenous and Afro-descendant. In this search for my roots I go to Portugal
  to retrace the steps of my great-grandfather, the only ancestor of whom I have reliable
  information. I want to find out how much of Portugal exists in my own culture. Language
  is just the beginning. We also have the music that comes from the viola, the food
  and sweets that rotate the colonial sugar period, and also the living heritage preserved
  by the architecture and the colors of the tiles. This trip to the unknown, will
  be a dip in Portuguese traditions, and a rediscovery of who I am.
