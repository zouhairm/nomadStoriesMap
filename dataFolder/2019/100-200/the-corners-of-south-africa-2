Text: "South Africa is well known for its history of wars and the massive racial tension\
  \ among the citizens that has been the headline for many years, I have always known\
  \ that South Africa as a country is very peculiar but unfortunately its uniqueness\
  \ has for years been clothed all over by the negative. I have decided to relate\
  \ South Africa to the flower lily which that can grow in the most impossible environment\
  \ and blossom in the most beautiful and delighting state. I have come across classic\
  \ architectural buildings with strong inspiring foundation of history. \n\nSouth\
  \ Africans pride themselves in their culture and that includes their clothing, food\
  \ and the manner of living.  I have had the opportunity to travel around few cities\
  \ in South Africa and I discovered the rawness and authenticity of the country which\
  \ I believe are the corners that the citizens feed off from. Each city is well known\
  \ for its qualities ,like the city in the Free State Province called Bloemfontein\
  \ , it is known for its beautiful roses hence it is refereed to as \"The City Of\
  \ Roses\". \nI would highly recommend that people should visit South Africa and\
  \ discover its corners."
