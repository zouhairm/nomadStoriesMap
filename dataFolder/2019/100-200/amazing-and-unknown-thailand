Text: "My first travel destination becomes Thailand. As we hear this Thailand\u2019\
  s name we think about temples and other things which are totally legal here like\
  \ escorts services and other things. My experience was totally different as i came\
  \ here i sae peoples are so calm and respectful. I was touched by their behavior\
  \ towards me. I was totally unknown for them but still they greet me so well and\
  \ when I\u2019m asking some kind of direction they helped me well. I mean for the\
  \ other people in this world they have to learn so many good things from this country.\
  \ There are always good and bad things in this big world but it depends on us what\
  \ we take inside us. The country is rich in temples, monuments and beautiful palaces\
  \ and gardens too. Thailand is very much famous for its beautiful beaches and other\
  \ famous resorts who provide luxurious stays for the travlers. I was staying in\
  \ good range hotel and everything was fine. I used to eat their local food and trust\
  \ me it\u2019s very tasty. I suggest everyone to travel Thailand and see their culture,\
  \ traditions and try their yummy food."
