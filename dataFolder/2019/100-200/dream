Text: 'Traveling like a cup of tea is not pleasant for everyone? There is love for
  traveling in all of us.

  But some people discover it and nurture it, and some also surrender to the limits
  and conditions of the community and destroy this feeling.

  I provide quotations for those who have oppressed the sense of interest in the journey.

  Quotes that can help us reciprocate the motivation to travel and understand its
  true feelings

  With the help of these quotes, I will feel the freedom and release of a bird.

  When I opened my arms to embrace love for travel, the whole world is a garden belonging
  to the Lord whose valued flowers are waiting to be arranged and enter our lifestyle.
  So do not restrict yourself and get rid of the restraint. Enjoy your life as it
  is and try to get to the point. I want this golden junior to use as a dream, and
  I will mention all my subjects during the tour.

  I hope im one of winner in this opportunity.'
