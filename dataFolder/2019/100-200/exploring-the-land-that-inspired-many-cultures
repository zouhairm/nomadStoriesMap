Text: "My recent visit to Netherlands was so facilitated. The main city Amsterdam\
  \ illustrated so many connections with Sri Lankan western coastal cities. Dutch\
  \ chanal of Colombo to Puttalam in Sri Lanka is the exact same as river Amster in\
  \ Amsterdam.\nIt\u2019s really fascinating to see how Dutch people made the exact\
  \ same irrigation system in their colonies.\nWhen I landed in Netherlands I felt\
  \ like a local as many things they have are so familiar and same as what i see in\
  \ Sri Lanka. Architecture, Crafts, Music and even Surnames of people stressed the\
  \ strong cultural bond we share. Truly amazing to see how two cultures are bonded,\
  \ although we are two nations laying in two different contents. \nGalle, Negombo\
  \ and Puttalam are the main Sri Lankan cities that Dutch armies conquered. Even\
  \ today the dutch culture is visible in those cities. It\u2019s inspiring to compare\
  \ those cities and Amsterdam. I was wondering how are these cities are so different\
  \ than other Sri Lankan cities. Now I know the reason, my visit to Amsterdam explained\
  \ and gave answers to many questions there was in my mind."
