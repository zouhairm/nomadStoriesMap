Text: "Everything started when I arrived last 30th of November. My expectations were\
  \ high but, I didn\u2019t realize in what I  getting my self into!\nIn the past,\
  \ I traveled to other countries looking for getting better personally and professionally,\
  \ UK, USA, Poland, Hungary, Japan. But Edmonton, Canada \U0001F1E8\U0001F1E6 was\
  \ something different, indeed! The coldest place, apathetic and with the worst lonelyness\
  \ not even compare with the narrative of Blake, Wild or Shakespeare .\nYou only\
  \ see empty smiles from people Don\u2019t want you, a plastic city with people away\
  \ of any kindness living their plastic lives.\nLondon! Szczecin! Budapest! Tokyo!\
  \ Prague! I miss you so much!! Your grace, your kindness, your cold, your people,\
  \ your charm, I miss them so much!!!! For how long will be like this?  Running away\
  \ and away because I want progress! But my birth place deny me my rights, my existence\
  \ my freedom! So I ended here, in this Ice desert. \nWhy always do you have to test\
  \ me?\nFuck you all!!"
