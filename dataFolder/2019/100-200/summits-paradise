Text: "Trekking in one of the peaks of the highest mountain ranges of Himalyas is\
  \ a challenge in itself. Conquering the highest peak is still a dream so I started\
  \ with my first step to conquer Kedarkantha peak 12,500ft. High. We began trekking\
  \ in early morning until 1pm as the moutains had their own rules of not wandering\
  \ in the evening due to extreme climatical changes.The whole journey till the summit\
  \ was an extraordinary delight, an adventure you dont want to return from. \U0001F60D\
  \u2764 The Allure of my first Himalyan trekk took my breath away. ( In literal sense\
  \ too.) And witnessing the Sunrise made me realise that there is never a night or\
  \ a problem that could defeat Sunrise or Hope."
