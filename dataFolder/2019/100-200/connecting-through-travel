Text: "I distinctly remember my therapist asking what I wanted to do while going through\
  \ my divorce. I blurted travel, with an attitude. What else could one want? Duh.\
  \ That's what I've been doing for the past five years, every chance I get. I've\
  \ been to 18 countries and now I have a new goal, 36 by 36. One thing that never\
  \ ceases to amaze me is the amazing people we meet along the way.  I usually take\
  \ a sweet from my country while traveling to share with is a great conversational\
  \ starter and a way to share my culture. One of the best experiences would have\
  \ to be a sweet Portuguese lady in a Lisbon shop who gave me the best hug and wished\
  \ me a Happy New Year. These connections are priceless and oh so inspiring! \U0001F60D"
