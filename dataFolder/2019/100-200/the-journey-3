Text: "I was the kind of person who used to be scared of going out, going to places,\
  \ exploring and traveling. My fear of travelling lets me stop seein the beauty of\
  \ the world, I took a risk of facing my fear, by then I realized what I missed just\
  \ because of listening to my fears. It\u2019s a beautiful world, everything is beautiful.\
  \ I\u2019m slowly loving the feeling, until I realizes that I\u2019m truly inlove\
  \ with the world. The first place I visited was Singapore, Oh How I love that place,\
  \ reminds me fo their Chicken Rice makes me wanna come back all over again. I then\
  \ Visited UAE. Beautiful country indeed, I fell inlove to this country. It\u2019\
  s beautiful, Everything is beautiful, The world is beautiful. And I cannot wait\
  \ to fall inlove with other places."
