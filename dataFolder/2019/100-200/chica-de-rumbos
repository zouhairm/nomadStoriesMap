Text: "I was born in Argentina Buenos Aires, my parents brought me to the United States\
  \ when I was 10, I\u2019ve lived in New York for about 18 years now, and fell in\
  \ love with different cultures, with people I haven\u2019t met yet, and places I\
  \ haven\u2019t visit, I want to be able to travel and tell my story to the world,\
  \ through the eyes of a girl that has many homes, as she moved a lot growing up,\
  \ and had a passion for the beauty that this world has to offer and it\u2019s not\
  \ exposed to everyone, tell in my humble words how beautiful and wonderful this\
  \ world is, raw, pure, real, it\u2019s my purpose to conect with people I haven\u2019\
  t met yet, and show their faces."
