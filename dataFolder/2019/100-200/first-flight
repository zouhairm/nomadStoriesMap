Text: Hello, my name is Pranali, from Mumbai. To be honest I never experienced flight
  because destiny never planned for me for any purpose. But this time my destiny was
  about to plan something new for me , A flight experience. My boyfriend went to Bangalore,
  Karnataka from 3 months from December for office work. His birthday was there on
  25th Feb. But Because of work load he didn't come to Mumbai for his birthday celebration.
  So we friends plan to go his place, Bangalore to give him surprise. And Yes, Next
  day we booked flight tickits. Finally my first flight was made by my destiny for
  a amazing purpose, to surprise my boyfriend. I was very excited for my first flight.
  Finally that day came. I enjoyed my Goairlines flight. Mumbai was shining like a
  diamonds. The view was amazing, I will never forget. Memorable. And by this I got
  a new experience, my first flight and my first new city Bangalore.
