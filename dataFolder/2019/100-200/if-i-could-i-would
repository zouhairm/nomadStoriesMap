Text: 'What if you could have a chance to travel to one of a world that you''ve never
  been there before?


  If I could, I would want to understand why the local have their own traditional
  greetings and why.

  If I could, I would want to taste their special drinks and foods, and how they made
  it.

  If I could, I would want to speak their idioms and when they speak about it.


  If I could, I would want to read their histories, then walk where it is, also know
  how and why did it happen.

  If I could, I would want to see their dressing and have once try it.

  If I could, I would want to hear their own special songs and sing with them.


  As I heard that Portugal had had once made a connection with the Indonesian archipelago,

  I really want to feel that ancient connection nowadays.

  I am compelling myself to write as if I have ever had it once, when the truth is
  that I haven''t.


  I am counting the day to win the chance when I would write my own travel writing
  scholarship.'
