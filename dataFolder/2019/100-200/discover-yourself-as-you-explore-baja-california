Text: The beauty and isolation of the deserts and beaches of Baja provide a peaceful
  setting for internal journeys of the traveler. The glamcamping and instagram photo
  trends, pale in significance when someone experiences real change from within. The
  growing trend of self improvement courses and retreats focusing on meditation, yoga,
  music and art are drawing new crowds as tourist tire of getting the best selfie
  over a volcano, wave or canyon... Fortunately, there are a number of innovative
  entreprenuers developing programs in the wilds of Baja, but with tremendous attention
  to the safety and comfort of participants so they feel secure and explore themselves,
  which is the greatest adventure of all!
