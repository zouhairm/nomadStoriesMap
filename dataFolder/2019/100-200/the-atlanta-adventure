Text: I was so excited when my step mom Nyrhetta told me to get in the car , but didn't
  tell me where we were going. It was my two step sisters, me and my stepmom. All
  of a sudden we were off on the road and 30 minutes turned to hours while I  figured
  then we were going away from our state because the scenary turned into mountains,
  hills, and a more beautiful scene. I must admit that driving over the hills were
  a great part of the traveling Adventure. When finally making it to Atlanta it to
  me was like different dimension because it has uncommon uniqueness such as the ground
  being made out of bricks in certain areas. It's so spacious and they have an underground
  mall to die for!
