Text: "Most of the good stories i tell can be told in 700 words or less. Let me try\
  \ one. It involves my father, Qudratullah, who used to have the annoying habit of\
  \ sucking on ice cubes, which he was doing one day, sitting in his recliner in front\
  \ of the television set. My mother was in the basement doing the laundry, when she\
  \ heard a great thump above her. She rushed upstairs and found my father unconscious\
  \ on the bathroom floor. She called 1122 and the paramedics arrived, but not before\
  \ my father had recovered, seemingly unharmed. It turned out that an ice cube had\
  \ lodged in his windpipe, cutting off his air supply, knocking him out as he staggered\
  \ toward the bathroom. Fortunately, his body heat melted the ice cube, restoring\
  \ the flow of oxygen, and saving his life. He\u2019s never sucked on an ice cube\
  \ again."
