Text: One of life's greatest pleasures is traveling, meeting places, people, accumulating
  stories. When you travel, it is as if you are reading a book and visiting Portugal
  is part of this unbelievable reading. Imagine that each page has a beautiful history
  of adventure, beauty, gastronomic tips and lots of culture. Embarking on this unknown
  journey fascinates me and makes me wonder how much it feels good to discover as
  a child that fill the world with the eyes of wonder all that you see for the first
  time. I want to admire every landscape and every detail of this wonderful country
  and share all my experiences with everyone who also loves traveling like me.
