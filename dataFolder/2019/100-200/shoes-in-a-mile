Text: "Travel from place to place tapping into the unknown. Finding new environments\
  \ and cultures. Connecting with new and different people, new perspective on life\
  \ and uncovering the beauty of life. \nMost importantly, letting myself go and opening\
  \ up my inner-eyes to what my world has put blinders to and removing it all in order\
  \ to see the wider view of the globe. \n\nTravelling out of South Africa for the\
  \ first time would be the opportunity to learn more about the world outside of the\
  \ ordinary. \n\nThe chance to learn more, feel free to connect with other people,\
  \ especially youth, and share experiences of what life has taught us to the point\
  \ where we are. Discovering things unheard-of and challenging the gullible to become\
  \ courageous and teachers of a new generation."
