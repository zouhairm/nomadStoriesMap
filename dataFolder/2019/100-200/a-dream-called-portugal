Text: "How to describe the unknown? Imagination takes care of words. Writing about\
  \ a place you don't know is a challenge to the surprises or disappointments that\
  \ can happen on the way. \nThe past of Brazil has influence from Portugal, a country\
  \ that in 1500 arrived colonized this soil and left marks that we found in architecture,\
  \ cuisine and culture.\nWhen we dream a part of us seeks a purpose. Embarking on\
  \ a journey to an unknown land can become reality and through journalism, it is\
  \ possible to fulfill the dream of travel of those who are not able to be present\
  \ on the site. They can make gifts by navigating the story that narrates the dream\
  \ place they would like to meet."
