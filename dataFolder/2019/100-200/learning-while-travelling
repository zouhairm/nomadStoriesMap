Text: "Some years ago, I went to aceh, at aceh I stayed for 2 weeks, at there I visited\
  \ the beaches, in the city I tried to understand or learned about the culture because\
  \ basicly they have a good traditio, where about the lifestyle, culture, language\
  \ , costum and many more.\nThe next day, I learned about their economic system,\
  \ my sister always said that finding mone in aceh is so easy, tha's why I was curious\
  \ at that time, and after learned about many things, I went to tobacco garden, visited\
  \ some destination, took picture under water and many interesting things  in the\
  \ great beaches. \n I love that moment  \n\nThanks\U0001F607"
