Text: "I\u2019ve been for the first time to Mexico City. Since I was child I wanted\
  \ go to the Caribbean part, etc. The point was the first day arrived to the Federal\
  \ District my Mexican friends sorpraised me. We went to a typical Mexican restaurant\
  \ were you find Mariachis and tequila, obviously! The name is la \u201CCoyoacana\u201D\
  \ you should go there. My friends told me before about the traffic there, but even\
  \ until been there didn\u2019t wanted believed it. It\u2019s so frustrated! It\u2019\
  s a big city for to be alone, I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve friends there. So the nexts\
  \ day we went to \u201CLas trajineras de Xochimilco\u201D close to the Mexico City.\
  \ You can rent like a boat for a big capacity of people. And they make you visit\
  \ around the lagoon. In this \u201Cboat\u201D you can eat, specially drink and dance!\
  \ It\u2019s so nice because also you can rent a radio for play your favourite music....\
  \ the other thing that I recommended is go to a very magic place called Tepoztl\xE1\

  \ restaurant \u201CLa gruta\u201D! I hope you guys can enjoyed me \U0001F618"
