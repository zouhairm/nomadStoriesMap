Text: Like Paulo Coelho said "When you want something, all the universe conspires
  in helping you to achieve it". I think he is right, nah I know so, but he also said
  "Life was always a matter of waiting for the right moment to act". What if it's
  not the right moment for me? You know what I will Stop worrying because I have a
  powerful God above who's watching ove me and my family he is almighty and I know
  he'll provide no matter what, sometimes he wait for the moment when I am down, when
  I have literally nothing, when all my enemies are laughing at me and he comes around
  and give me everything. After such thinking I am going take a leap into the unknown
  because I know that wherever my heart is, there I will find my treasure. Let's take
  a leap of faith There is only one thing that can makes our dreams impossible to
  achieve and that is the fear of failure let's not give it that power ever.
