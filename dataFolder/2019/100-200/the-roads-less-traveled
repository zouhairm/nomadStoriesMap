Text: Off the beaten travel path to explore the ways the Croatian Coast is a gem and
  a jewel of the European continent.  From the Adriatic Sea where fisherman still
  gather their catch the way they did hundreds of years ago to the Balkans where the
  farmers tend their herds without the use of the newest technologies.  Perhaps even
  a diversion to Slovenia to look at awe at the Southern Austrian Alps and the landscapes
  of mountain valleys, mountain springs, and pristine lakes.  And last, to Venice
  where a scenic walk at twilight brings closure to an adventure to write about!
