Text: I found true friendship in the most random places.  Maybe the friends weren't
  mine, but I observed friends come together with nothing but their stories.  They
  didn't brag about cars, high salaries, or their newest phones.  They simply got
  together to just be.  They've been friends since they were kids.  They never had
  to impress anyone else.  They went to temple, they went to the grocery store, they
  went down the street to talk about their day.  They bought Chai at the Chai stand.  As
  long as they had each other they were the richest people in the entire world.
