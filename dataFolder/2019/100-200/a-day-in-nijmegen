Text: 'Nijmegen is a city in Netherlands, rich with people of different cutures and
  society. People go often there for coffee shops and smoke weed-not to worry it''s
  all legal there.

  It is close to the Germany border so i decided to visit there as i was living in
  a town of Germany from almost two years, and that''s the 5th time i was visiting
  in the city. Every time it leads to a new adventures.

  I always take the bus from Kleve(a town in Germany) to Plein 1992 (second last stop
  to the central station, Nijmegen) because there you find the main market area and
  river side close by (probably 10 mins by walking). I walk aroung some of the awesome
  market area with some amazing joyfull people''s, you might find the kindest people
  here, open to talk with anyone in random. I visited a coffee shop with a group of
  friends with me and decided to smoke a bit- if you are planning for there don''t
  forget to bring your official valid id with you either they won''t let you enter.

  To be continue...'
