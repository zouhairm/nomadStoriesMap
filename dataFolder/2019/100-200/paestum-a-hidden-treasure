  I was 18 years old and I decided to leave everything and go. I arrived in a small
  village called Paestum, in the south of Italy. The beautiful Campaign that we all
  know by its capital, Naples. And ancient territory of the kingdom of Aragon. But
  there, in Paestum... History comes from much earlier. When you get there, understanding
  is not so simple, they have their own dialect. And the views due to being an ancient
  Greek city, far from what we expect from an Italian town. The conquest comes directly
  to our hearts. Or why not to say it, to our stomachs. For there, not everything
  is pretty ruins. The buffalos are wide open while we enjoy the freshest mozzarella,
  since it is there and in the nearby towns where they produce it. And what to say
  about people, welcoming and familiar. I spent a year in this place, so if you want
  to feel at home, surrounded by history, sea and good food... You can't miss this
  hidden place. My village in Italy, my family now.
