Text: "I\xB4ve always had a bit too much curiosity inside of my heart, ever since\
  \ I was a boy ne ver could stop experiencing the world in a difrent way, my own\
  \ way. \nMy life took a very unike turn because of that and I couldn\xB4t be happyer.\
  \ \nThis curiosity I descrive, have lead me to embrace a search for human knoledge\
  \ and art.\nA person like me, in order to take every oportuninty must be open to\
  \ take any chances to find new experience. \nLast sumer a last time oportunity came\
  \ knoking to my door when a bunch of old friends where looking for an extra integrant\
  \ to his traveling group and I didn\xB4t hesitate to take the chance to experience\
  \ a new country.\nCanada was out of this world surprised me in such diferent ways\
  \ that I never spect and gave me a bunch of cool experienc that now days have turn\
  \ into very fun histories, good stories thaat I certanly will tell to my grandchildren."
