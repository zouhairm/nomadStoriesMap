Text: After visiting an uncle in the Netherlands for a few months, I got more bold
  and started to visit other neighboring countries like Spain, France, Italy, Denmark,
  Sweden, Norway, and many more countries all the way to Asia, the Middle East, and
  South America.  I was so footloose and fancy free that I truly became a roaming
  wanderer for a few years until I got tired and decided to go back home to my family
  in California and decided to settle down.  I have no regrets for not going to College
  and studying for a degree because my travels taught me things I would never have
  learned in a University.  I studied how to survive in our world by getting to know
  the peoples, cultures, and languages, and the way of life in the world stage.
