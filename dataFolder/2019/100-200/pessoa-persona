Text: "I know about Fernando Pessoa in the beginning of my life in Chile. I was an\
  \ Mexican student tryin to finish my degree in Architecture dar of my family and\
  \ my country.  \n\nWalking in old books galleries of Santiago y read in a book \u201C\
  desasosiego\u201D and the word got me.. the meaning of this word was de starting\
  \ of all my passion for Fernando Pessoa, the writer of the Desasosieg\u2019s book.\n\
  \nDuring 8 years I had reading, researching, looking all about the Pessoa history,\
  \ histories.  I also prepared a festival about him with the Portugal embassy, (the\
  \ first big celebration in Chile about Pessoa) and I directed a play in a popular\
  \ teatro in Chile.\n\nI never visit Portugal. My friend always say why?!... and\
  \ .. I always answer with the same expresi\xF3n: \u201CI don\u2019t know, maybe\
  \ it is a big wish that I would like to have all my life.\u201D"
