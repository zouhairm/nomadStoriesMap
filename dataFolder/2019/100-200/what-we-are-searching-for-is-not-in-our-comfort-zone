Text: 'Dear Life

  For once in my life I got out of my way, my so called comfort zone, my land and
  went all the way from South Africa, Africa, to Saudi Arabia Riyadh in Asia.


  Should we know and understand that what we are searching might not be where we are
  at, but in those foreign lands we never think of.


  Rare principle of Humanity, kindness and such harmony I found in Saudi Arabia. Attending
  the Misk Global Forum with the Intentions to grow professionally in the business
  world.


  All I ever found was the growth and sexiest of Humanity and sharing Love to another
  human.


  I can go on and on but to summarize the story, my stay in my Country made me believe
  that I''m an abnormal creature by loving Human so much that I''d sacrifice my only
  blanket to cover the cold. I''ve only realized what we search might not be where
  we are but rather in those beautiful foreign lands.'
