Text: "Immersing oneself into the rich, diverse and  untamed cultures of the world\
  \ to find yourself in many exotic,  exciting and new ways. Rich heritages and vibrant\
  \ colors with smells that will last a lifetime.  By immersing yourself into the\
  \ world we live in without any judgement,  and on a deeper understanding will open\
  \ your eyes to the possibilities and opportunities on every corner, therefore making\
  \ a contribution to those you meet and come into contact with.  Learning the meaning\
  \ of life, love, truth,  sacrifice,  sadness, joy, hope, reflection and more. Being\
  \ able to see what is around you every day, not being closed off to the smells,\
  \ visions and untamed beauty in all. Grace, humility and gratitude is what I hope\
  \ for. \U0001F64F\U0001F64F\U0001F64F"
