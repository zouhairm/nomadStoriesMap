Text: "This is a story of a men, who want to do one thing in this life, memories,\
  \ yeah, that's what I said \"Memories\". Do you remember all the amazing things\
  \ you lived? Like the first time you arrived to the big city, you felt so small\
  \ around the biggest building you have ever seen? Or the first time you saw that\
  \ amazing waterfall's and you felt the water in your face?.\n That's what life is\
  \ about, we are to busy now working, taking care of our problems and we forgot to\
  \ take a time for ourselfs so that's why I want to take this trip, to remember those\
  \ feelings.\nSo this is where the story begins...\n\nHere we are at the airport,\
  \ waiting for one of the pleaures of life that is call \"Portugal\" the plane it's\
  \ almost arriving and I'm really anxious. I don't know nothing about this culture\
  \ so we are going to start from cero.\nI'm really not afraid of what is going to\
  \ happen because that's the best thing of a adventure."
