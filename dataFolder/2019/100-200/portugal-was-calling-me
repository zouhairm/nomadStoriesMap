Text: "I'm halfway through my degree in architecture. It's a 6 year course with two\
  \ extra years in industry. And only then can you apply for the final year of exams\
  \ after that. It's long, it's tiring, it's depressing and it's stressful. I'm only\
  \ 24 and am having my mid life crisis already, call it quarter life crisis. Last\
  \ year I moved to Amsterdam for a year and there is something so special about that\
  \ time and place. All those nostalgic coming of age clich\xE9s ring true for that\
  \ year. And probably because I knew it was only for one year before I move somewhere\
  \ new for my masters. Now I'm at RCA, the world's number one art school, and all\
  \ I feel is this gravitational pull to Portugal. Is it the weather, the laid back,\
  \ romantic, honest and open projected demeanor of its people in popular culture\
  \ or is it just the want to get out of London and move to an opposite place? I don't\
  \ know but please let me find out."
