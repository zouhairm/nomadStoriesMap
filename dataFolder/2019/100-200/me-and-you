Text: I have recently been to Wayanad which is in Kerala.It has been such a wonderful
  and mesmerising experience.  The caves, waterfalls , dams ,hills everything was
  beautiful about that place. The local food was amazing though I don't like South
  indian food that much but that was  the most delicious . I wish I could hv stayed
  there for more days but but was just 2 days trip as I have to visit other places
  also. Even the cottage where we stayed was blissfully amazing. The view around the
  cottage and the bonfire at night. It was a complete experience that any person who
  loves travelling can have.
