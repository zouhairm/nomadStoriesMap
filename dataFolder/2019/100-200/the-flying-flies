  \ and the Highland in Scotland. He was happy to travel, to know new places but always\
  \ struggling with his loneliness.\n\nWhen he arrives in Edinburgh, he hits another\
  \ fly, and she was the most beautiful fly that he met. They fly through the castle,\
  \ and she was talking about all the history of the city and the country, and she\

  \ he fell in love.\n\nAt the end of the night, they combined to see each other the\
  \ next day at the same point they've met at the first\n\nThe other he flies to the\
  \ meeting points, and he waits for her. But she never comes. \n\nHe just put down\
  \ his head, and sad he starts again his travel, flying. He starts to think that\
  \ he will be alone forever, and would never find another fly like her.\n\nTo be\
  \ continued..."
