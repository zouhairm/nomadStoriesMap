Text: "This heart beat fast when I heard that country, this was one of my dream countries\
  \ to visit even to live there as an Portugal citizen.\n\nbut it's not that easy\
  \ to live there, I have to think about visas, tickets and etc. \n\nas an Indonesian\
  \ citizen it is very difficult for me to get an visa because I have to have conditions\
  \ that might be difficult for me.\n\nbut I never gave up working and continued working\
  \ to earn money, I had to fight for my love there. So yeaaah now my dream come true\
  \ \n\nI have traveling with sister to explore Portugal \u2764"
