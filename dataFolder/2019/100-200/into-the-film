Text: "\"not pursuing happiness reduces the feeling of disappointment...\" \n** \n\
  Carly Rhodes Xavier is a senior university student, finally on her final year of\
  \ college, maintaining to get everything together while having a part time job at\
  \ a local cafe near her apartment. She keeps up a good front; building a hard exterior\
  \ up around her so no one can see inside. The only thing anyone can judge her from\
  \ was her choice of makeup eye shadow and cold unfriendly attitude that keep people\
  \ at least five feet away from her.  She hates what she does and the choices she\
  \ makes, the only thing that's still keeping her sane was the stack of romantic\
  \ comedy movies and shows in her room. Of course, no one knows this but her; for\
  \ all they know she's dead inside who doesn't believe in anything romantic. Until\
  \ one night, whilst she watches another drama show that she loves, a glint of light\
  \ appears from the screen and despite feeling scared inside, she chooses to venture\
  \ not knowing that the world she adores might not be as magical and beautiful as\
  \ she imagines. This is just the beginning. . ."
