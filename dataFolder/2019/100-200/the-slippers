Text: "In the frustration that comes with getting lost, lays the sweet joy of discovery,\
  \ of finding little gems in narrow alley ways and walking into places so hidden\
  \ to the eyes, of observing what seems so ordinary and mundane and wondering why\
  \ you have always seen it but not looked at it, of turning around and looking at\
  \ the street again as you make your way out, because you may never see it from the\
  \ same angle again. \nIn this voyage, you slowly reach out to the city that strips\
  \ her unfamiliarity and becomes nameless so you can make her yours. The city that\
  \ never seizes to surprise you yet makes you feel safe, if you completely let go."
