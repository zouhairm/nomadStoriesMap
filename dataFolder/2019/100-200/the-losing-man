Text: "Often i think of the beautiful town\nSeated by the sea\nThere came a cozy puff\
  \ of wind\nThat blew me straight to the fantasy of this materialistic world \nI\
  \ was excused a moment for sighing the gaps of the untouched world in my mind \n\
  Thst grows in me the losing man \nHe lost to the city by the nuisance of the streets\
  \ and clubs \nHe loitered around hunting for his friends.\nHe was waiting and exhausted\
  \ and observing the scene\nHe could see people from all walks of life meeting with\
  \ the other world which seem glowing \nPeople were melted away by the sways of busy\
  \ dancers and streets entertainers.\nHe got lost into the nativity of the beautiful\
  \ moment there.\nThinking of the beauty life could create. \nHe loved \nHe smiled\n\
  He continued hunting for his friends \nHe fought them and joined the scene there\
  \ and melted alway by the blues and darks  of the night."
