Text: "Elmina Castle was erected by the Portuguese in 1482 as S\xE3o Jorge da Mina\
  \ (St. George of the Mine) Castle, also known simply as Mina (or Feitoria da Mina)\
  \ in present-day Elmina, Ghana (formerly the Gold Coast). It was the first trading\
  \ post built on the Gulf of Guinea, and the oldest European building in existence\
  \ south of the Sahara. [1] First established as a trade settlement, the castle later\
  \ became one of the most important stops on the route of the Atlantic slave trade.\
  \ The Dutch seized the fort from the Portuguese in 1637, and took over all the Portuguese\
  \ Gold Coast in 1642. The slave trade continued under the Dutch until 1814. In 1872,\
  \ the Dutch Gold Coast, including the fort, became a possession of the British Empire."
