Text: "I just wanted to stay home. But no. I was packing and the cab was waiting for\
  \ me outside. \xABI am not prepared to the cold weather and the lack of real coffee\xBB\
  \ I thought closing the door behind me. What I didn't know back then was that I\
  \ was about to go to a place that would change my life forever. A place that put\
  \ a feeling of saudade into my soul that I have never experienced before. A place\
  \ where I understood why some people never settle down. A place where I found the\
  \ last thing I though I could find there. Myself."
