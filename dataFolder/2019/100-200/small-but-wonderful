Text: "Traveling by car in Portugal can be one of the most incredible experiences\
  \ I have ever experienced. I thought I would only find old buildings, palaces and\
  \ beaches, however, when renting a car and starting this journey, I came across\
  \ a new sense of lifestyle. I was able to explore paradisiacal places yet in the\
  \ first kilometers. I also met receptive people and discovered how it is possible\
  \ to be light in the middle of the 21st century's rush.\n\nBeaches with giant waves,\
  \ magnificent tubes and also for a simple surf at the end of the day with friends.\
  \ Castles, ramparts, palaces, old buildings and an incredible medieval experience\
  \ in the town of \xD3bidos. The beauties of Lisbon, Algarve and Porto enchanted\
  \ me. But what took my breath away was Nazar\xE9 beach and Algar de Benagil. Sintra\
  \ and Quinta da Regalera is an inspiring tour that refers back to the past but with\
  \ a look at the abstract future. \n\nYou can find unforgettable places at every\
  \ corner that you pass by.\n\nFor sure, traveling around Portugal and getting to\
  \ know every corner of this tiny giant country is worth it!"
