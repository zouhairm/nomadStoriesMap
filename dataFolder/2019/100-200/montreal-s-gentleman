Text: "Few years ago, my school friends and i went to visit Montreal for the first\
  \ time. Our happiness was clear and reflected in the eyes, we just wanted to enjoy\
  \ as much as we can this short week in this famous, beautiful and historical country.\
  \ The first three days were amazing! We went to the Old Montreal, the popular Sainte\
  \ catherine avenue, the old port of Montreal and we've tried some delicious specialities\
  \ that gives as the taste to come back again for it.\nEverything was perfect, the\
  \ spring weather with it's cool wind and the smell of the flowers and the green\
  \ herbs. \nOne morning, waiting for my friends to get ready, i went to the lobby\
  \ trying to do some research on the hostel's computer for another day of visits\
  \ and enjoyment. Suddenly, a tall, handsome and smilling gentleman came to sit next\
  \ to me. He started the conversation."
