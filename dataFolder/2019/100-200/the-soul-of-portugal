Text: 'I won''t really know the "story" until I experience the "soul" of the place
  and its people and its culture, which is what fascinates me to travel and to write.
  I have over 400,000+ followers on social media (see CG FEWSTON) and I love reaching
  new individuals whether in person or on-line. I do expect to write about the "place"
  as a character and seek to explore and reveal to others what they might not otherwise
  expect to find (to write about what is rarely covered in usual online blogs and
  vlogs). Also, history fascinates me and I will likely incorporate key historical
  facts and places into the story. You may read more about me and my writing at www.cgfewston.me.
  I''ve been a Visiting Scholar at the American Academy in Rome in Italy, where I
  was able to do some travel writing about Rome (see stories on LinkedIn where I have
  over 17,000+ followers): https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgfewston'
