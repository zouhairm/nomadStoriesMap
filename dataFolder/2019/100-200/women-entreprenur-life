Text: I making Journey, sharing with another women about entrepreneurship. And get
  some issues about women entreprenur and entrepreneur life is about caracter, mental
  and mindset. How to build your caracter, how to buld your strong mental, and make
  your mind always have positive mindset. I believe  on this life, not about entrepreneurship
  life but our life, work with heart,and  put in our mindset with gratittude. They
  say You cant get rich if you work with  your heart,  but i say i believe it that,  maybe
  i cant rich today,  but i got my caracter today. In entrepreneurship we have two
  caracter before we have a lot money,  and after we got a lot money.
