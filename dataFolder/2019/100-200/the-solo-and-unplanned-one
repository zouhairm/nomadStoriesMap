Text: The famous phrase "the world is a book and those who do not travel read only
  a single page" is very much true. I keep traveling as I love to! This was a special
  one as it was my first so called international trip. Crossing the border by road,
  boarding a flight to Kathmandu, landing without any telecommunication option, meeting
  unknowns and then becoming the best of friends, everything was adventure. The  beauty
  and cold of the hills, the charm of the valleys, the chirping of birds, the song
  of the rivers, the howling of animals, pleasant air, quiet places, etc., helped
  me heal all of my mental and physical problems. Three days, and I had to cover the
  most of I could.
