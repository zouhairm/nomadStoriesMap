Text: "Growing up in the us and being middle eastern it was hard to connect to people\
  \ who didn\u2019t have a sense of culture and openness in knowing about other cultures\
  \ around the world. Education was always limited in teaching about countries outside\
  \ of the us and the news would portray other countries as second best.\nNot until\
  \ I went to university and stayed in international dorms did I truly realize that\
  \ there\u2019s a whole world outside of the us.\nGetting to know people from other\
  \ countries drew my curiosity and hence started my passion for traveling. I have\
  \ been to over 25 countries and have learned so much about the world and myself\
  \ and the free knowledge of culture and human interaction and connections from all\
  \ over the world makes the traveling experience priceless."
