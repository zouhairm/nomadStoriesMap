  \ saw many tradition and historical places and saw many calture.when ever some one\
  \ make travel plan its a goal to achieve something and my goal is to be a flexible\
  \ person in my life and be success.\nTrip is to show the hard and soft live in all\
  \ the world,\nIts what we need to see.\nI saw peaple who live in coldest and hottest\
  \ places and saw the history of past by traditional place.\n The calture of every\
  \ place and peaple is to show how thay live and how thay are.\nJust when i was in\
  \ Kandhar i saw people thay sleep on ground because of hot weather and\nSimple life.\n\
  In another i saw the Bamiyan people who sleep on warm Namad because of cold weather\
  \ and hard working.\nSo many different is in word and need to see by our eyes and\
