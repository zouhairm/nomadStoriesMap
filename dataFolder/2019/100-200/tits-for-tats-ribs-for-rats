Text: 'So I don''t know whether you want prose or poetry? So let''s go for a hybrid.


  The Year is Two Double-O One Six,

  The kid lives in England, life behaves like a bitch

  He''s working and hurting, the nights are so long,

  His dreams smell like Africa, just wants to be gone


  He jumps on that WiFi to download a new life,

  Uploads a profile to impress his new wife,

  No skills and no lies, let''s escape and let''s thrive

  My old life is dying, I killed it no knives


  Namibia wants him, the Nambians want him right now

  Get here by the weekend, we''ll see you brown cow

  Three planes and 4 taxis, a bus and a walk

  Kongola you beauty, I''m all yours pink sow


  Kid digs like a badger, he sweats and he burns

  Sleeps under the stars, ignoring world turns

  Hurts melts into droplets, pain becomes a mirage

  Each strike of the shovel, steps away from Farage


  No Brexit, no Trump, nothing more, just the sun

  The Nambians love him, he loves them like sons

  They bend it like Beckham, like termites they build

  This new life emerges, his old world is healed'
