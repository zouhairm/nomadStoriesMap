Text: I spent only 3 days in Lisboa with my family few years ago and was enough to
  fell in love with Portugal and its people. We took a bus ride with our little 4
  years old's twins nephews to get to the car and transport museum. When we reached
  the bus stop, for any reason the ramp to get down for the stroller was not working,
  and the bus driver did not want to help us,however an old woman around 80 years
  was watching our struggling situation from her seat and she get up directly to me
  and took the stroller by a side and helped me to get it down, it was amazing! She
  could be my grandma! And she helped me to lifted it like one of my gym's friend!
  .we had heard about portuguese's hospitality but this was far beyond.
