Text: 'While I had been to many picturesque beaches found in Goa, I had never been
  to Palolem beach.

  Surrounded by rocky hills at both ends, Palolem beach is a crescent shaped beach
  located in quieter South Goa. Its picture postcard beauty is evident as you walk
  acrosd a small island on its northern tip at low tide or trek to the secluded Butterfly
  beach nearby.

  With its turquoise blue crystal clear water and palm line shores, its no doubt that
  this beach is also known as The Paradise Beach!

  As one takes a walk along the shore, a number of palm grooves are seen lining the
  white sand beach, which adds to the beauty of the surrounding.

  The green mountains in the area are the icing on the cake and make the entire region
  a surreal experience.

  A number of backpackersand holidaymakers from all across the globe visit this beach
  owing to its budget friendly bamboo huts. It is also considered as one of the safest
  swimming spots in entire Goa region where adventure seekers can enjoy activities
  such as kayaking and paddle boarding without any fear.

  Hands down it was one of the most amazing experience I''ve had in a long time..'
