Text: "Time\u2026 A strange way to difine what we feel, where we\u2019re going and\
  \ things we\u2019re doing. I\u2019ve been to Portugal two times in less than a year,\
  \ and for a moment i thought it was two different places. The magic point was the\
  \ first time i was just watching, but the second time it was seeing. It\u2019s so\
  \ graceful to see the things without thinks how long they\u2019ve been there, just\
  \ to appreciate and understand that everything has it purpose in this Earth. You\
  \ could be a small dot, almost invisible, in this universe. However you have a soul,\
  \ and it\u2019s broad, where you live and feel like home. I\u2019m so glad that\
  \ i had this two opportunities to live this experiences, they were exceptional to\
  \ see with love things my eyes had capture the colours already."
