Text: "A young British couple go to Paris for a birthday. They have A most romantic\
  \ day out in the city and finally decide to go to the P\xE8re Lachaise cemetery\
  \ to pay their respects to their respective idles buried there. They walk amongst\
  \ the library of souls and decide to call it the Death Catalogue. The day is one\
  \ of pure romance and pontificating. However they soon become disenchanted when\
  \ they see a family of fat American tourists disrespectfully posing in front of\
  \ Jim Morrison\u2019s grave. The sight completely kills it for them. This is to\
  \ be a story like Waiting For Godot or Withnail and I where it\u2019s a narrative\
  \ about nothing in particular other than a very romantic and idyllic time in a pair\
  \ of young people\u2019s lives and how innocence is inevitably corrupted in a reality\
  \ of narcissism that engulfs every aspect of modern life, even here in this cemetery."
