Text: When I was on third year in university, I traveled to Yogyakarta city alone.
  It's my first time to go to Yogyakarta city alone without any partner. When I was
  arriving at Yogyakarta, I called my friend and ask to stay in her house, but unfortunately
  she had another agenda that night so I stay at her friend house and for the first
  time I felt really weird to stay a night at stranger house. The day after tomorrow,
  me and my friends went to a small district and the place was very far away from
  the city. We went there by motorcycle and it was need about 3 hours by motorcycle.
  It was my first experience to ride with motorcycle for so long. But the we got so
  amazing view and we also ate Durian. It's local fruit from Indonesia. And the other
  day, we went to Pok Tungga beach, the beach was still clean, not really crowded,
  and also very cheap. People usually spent their spare time to see the sunset at
  beach.
