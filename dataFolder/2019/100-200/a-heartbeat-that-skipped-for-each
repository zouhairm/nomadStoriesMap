Text: Just your local funeral director, who lived vicariously through the pictures
  and stories of those she met daily. Each day she felt as though she was living her
  best life, till a once in a lifetime opportunity knocked on her door. With little
  thought, she picked up all the things she could fit in a suit case and hoped on
  the next plane flight out. Not looking back, but looking in an unknown future. That
  would entail, travelling city to city. Exploring all the things she once heard and
  saw. But now this was her life to live. Going down to local shops, restaurants and
  simply relearning life the way the commoners do. Continually writing her story and
  sharing it with those who wish. Hoping that it'll inspire those who read to break
  free from the cycle of life, and experience their heartbeat with purpose. Leaving
  the rest up of the story blank. Awaiting for every encounter, feeling, view to inspire
  the next page to follow.
