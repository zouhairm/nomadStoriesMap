Text: "One of the best things about editing the Explore series in Coastal Living is\
  \ that I get to dispatch immensely talented writers on unique journeys to coasts\
  \ near and far with the expectation of something truly new. And back they come,\
  \ with tales of islands off the coast of Norway where the world's most esteemed\
  \ eiderdown is collected, of stalking elusive bonefish from the crystal flats of\
  \ the Bahamas, from tiny restaurants in Alaska that draw foodies from around the\
  \ world, and from islands off California and in the Caribbean with such powerful\
  \ allure that they draw writers back again and again.\n\nAs much as I love every\
  \ one of these destinations, what I love even more is the writing. Here, then, are\
  \ eight travel tales from our Explore column that inspire and delight me\u2014I\
  \ hope they will you, as well. Because it's one thing to travel well ... it's another\
  \ thing entirely to write about it with such clarity, poise, and style.\n\nHappy\
  \ reading!"
