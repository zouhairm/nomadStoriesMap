Text: So you take a you g kid from the hood and put him into military clothing. Expect
  him to go to another country that is unknown and never heard about and tell him
  to try to connect with the people and the customs. This is what happen to me and
  little known fact I established a great friend for life, a guy who I could count
  on to be here for me, to connect with me and to establish a bond that is unbreakable.
  This is what my story is all about perseverance, passion for life and the willingness
  to believe in myself. Others are not blessed with the opportunity to travel and
  see the world, see life for what it is. Which is beauty beyond yourself, this is
  not a damn fancy story or a life lesson. Just a story about a young kid who was
  granted a opportunity to actually see a defintion of culture that was completely
  different than his and now that young man is ready to take the next step forward.
  To make changes and to advocate for the voiceless.
