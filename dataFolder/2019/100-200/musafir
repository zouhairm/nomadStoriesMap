Text: "It\u2019s an adventurous, and exploring at the same time. Experiencing the\
  \ new culture, landscape, climate,people!!!\nAll the way everyday was a new flow\
  \ to dive in with activities along with the people n wild life...my personal interpretation\
  \ for that place is I went with out any expectation as Iam a performing arts student,\
  \ all I need is something new to see and experience, the place iam talking about\
  \ is Kashmir, later while coming to south (my home)  I travelled almost four states\
  \ with out money, no mobile phone, all I knew was railways stations and the maps\
  \ the geography of the country which I read in my schooling days... with that I\
  \ travelled Punjab, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan,Gujarat,Maharashtra n reached my home\
  \ Hyderabad!! All this happend in 2017 April to June..in between all I did was communication\
  \ with different people to attain my needs and I did it, survival is the basic instinct\
  \ of human being, that\u2019s what I believe in....\nThank you!!"
