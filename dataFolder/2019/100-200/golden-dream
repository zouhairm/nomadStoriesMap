Text: I have been able to travel to other places, but in my internal jurisdiction
  I have always wanted to go to Portugal. Learn their culture, gastronomy, establish
  a real connection with the locals... And above all learn the language. I love how
  it sounds. Lately I have gone through unpleasant experiences in my life and I think
  the best way to overcome anything is nurturing my of others. Portugal has always
  been the mark on my map. I am a professional and I learn fast but above all I have
  this incredible curiosity to value other cultures. I really hope you give me this
  opportunity that I will appreciate... Going to Portugal is my golden dream
