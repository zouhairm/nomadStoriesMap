Text: I carry a mendate and a vision of God,to inspire and encourage for those who
  are broken,feeling worthless about to loss all hopes.Because I myself I have been
  in those shoes ,until I found a voice into writing because I was so beyond the redemption
  stage according to me .But when grace and mercy selected me I live to inspire and
  encourage others in all works of live.Bringing back hope and courage because if
  I can overcome so could the next person ,if they are patiently listened to even
  given a second of a moment could mean a world,because I know it would have if my
  case that's what I needed more than anything.So I am equipped and ready to take
  up to the challenge to assist those in needs
