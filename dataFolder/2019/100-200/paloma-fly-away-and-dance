Text: "Paloma. That\u2019s my name.\n\n Even when my flight began in Madrid like a\
  \ storm in wich a little dove couldn\u2019t survive, I felt my feathers hold me\
  \ for landing in an unexpected destination. After I\u2019ve lost myself in Frankfurt\
  \ International Airport finally  I arrived to Erfurt. I visited to a \u201Cchilean\
  \ digital  friend\u201D who lives with his boyfriend and we went to the most anxiously\
  \ awaited latin party in town. \u201CDespacito\u201D couldn\u2019t miss in the Dj\
  \ setlist but when we said \u201Cthis is the last song\u201D I was dying to dance\
  \ some known so it started to sound \u201CColegiala\u201D. I was so happy because\
  \ is the typicall new year song in Chile I couldn\u2019t stand the laughter... \u201C\
  Palo, have you ever thought dance Colegiala in Erfurt?\u201D My friend  asked me.\
  \ Guess what... I have not."
