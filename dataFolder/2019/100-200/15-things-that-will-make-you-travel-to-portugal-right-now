Text: 'Im one of the kind of person who thinks that traveling you can bring histories
  and people to life and make a conecctions beyond language and flags. If i get the
  pass for this scholarship I would love find a new vision of people that make this
  country very particular and unique. I visualize telling about commom people making
  differences.  Despite culture, human history is very important and make tourism
  more human. In the tittle I propose is basically find 15 things that make Portugal
  and its people one country people around the world will want to visit. I dont know
  were i will start. I never been there, but I had this inmense desire.

  PD. Also to me will be a honor have the opportunity to be trained by Tim Neville.'
