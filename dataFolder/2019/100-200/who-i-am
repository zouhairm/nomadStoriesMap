Text: 'It will be the story of a gay Spanish boy who thought that being gay is wrong
  because is from a small village. But, with the help of two smart girls and a travel
  to Latvia, will find himself as a gay boy and will accept it. It will let him to
  find two boys, one is a so handsome model, and the other will be a cute local boy.
  He think that he fall in love with the local boy because the model is totally different
  to him. But, with the time, he will think that he is in love with the model boy.
  It''s makes him think a lot about the two boys...

  After a travel to Portugal, the Spanish boy will find with which boy is really in
  love, but it''s to late for the relationship? Will he find another boy? Will he
  start a relationship with the local boy? Or with the model? Will he discover that
  he is not in love? What could happen?

  (It is inspired in my true history, but I am not sure about how it will be the end)'
