Text: India, a place of religion, culture and mistery. Exciment and fear those were
  the feeling on my flight from Milan to Delhi, you never know what to expect and
  most of the time what you will find it is never what you are prepared for. In a
  place like India especially nothing goes according to plan, nothing is easy and
  nothing is boring. Color is the main theme that connects over 25 cultures, color
  is the heart of India. I remember the fired clay color of Delhi city, the blue of
  Jodhpur, the pink of Jaipur, the white of Calcutta, the beige and red of Mysore,
  the green of Darjeeling and the sand of Hampi. Colors give you feelings, so does
  India.
