Text: Mostly Pakistan is a country which is misunderstood till date due to negative
  news propagated by western media. Although these days various youtubers and travel
  vloggers  making amazing videos and portraying the true picture of Pakistan but
  still a long way to go to show the world the real picture of Pakistan. A country
  that has all 4 seasons mountains and abundant natural beauty. The one thing the
  tourist would always love about Pakistan is the hospitality of the people which
  should be promoted to make it the top tourist spot in the world.M story would depict
  the real beauty of Pakistan and its people.
