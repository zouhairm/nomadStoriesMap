Text: "Once there was a little house on the hills. Just like the others. It's was\
  \ sma and family sized. It's housed a little girl by the age of ten and her two\
  \ elderly grandparents who's hair was more silver than a ring. \n\nIt was a lovely\
  \ day in Greece. The sun blazing over the sand mountains that cascaded around like\
  \ a never ending bowl. The little girl was dressed up in a little red dress with\
  \ little red shoes. She was going to go and explore the coast for a little bit.\
  \ Not aware of what was coming her grandparents let her go. \n\nAs she travelled\
  \ down to the coast she passed many mountain goats and markets."
