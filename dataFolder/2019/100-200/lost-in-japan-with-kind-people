Text: "It was our last day in Tokyo, we wanted to say goodbye to Japan for the best\
  \ way, so we gone to a typical bar-restaurant in a lost street. We went inside and\
  \ the waitress said the bar closes at 11 and we entered at 10. We said its ok and\
  \ ate and drank, the waitress asked us where we are from so we said from Mexico\
  \ and she sang a song of Shakira in spanish. We ate fish but we didn\u2019t spoke\
  \ japanese and we didn\u2019t had traductor nor internet at that moment, so we spoke\
  \ with signals. In other moment a japanese man spokes in english with us. We ordered\
  \ more beer and japanese drinks. The man went and we still drinking. At 11 we wanted\
  \ to pay, but the waitress said someone paid our bill. We were very surprised and\
  \ emotional. She said the japanese man before gone,  paid our bill. So finally we\
  \ went to our hostal but the waitress ran in our direction and she said she was\
  \ happy to know us and she gave us hugs. Our last night in Japan was really magic\
  \ like this country."
