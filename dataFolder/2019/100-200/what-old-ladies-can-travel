Text: "I\u2019ve always enjoyed traveling. I\u2019ve traveled all my life but I never\
  \ could imagine feeling well traveled.  So many places and so little time.  Now\
  \ it\u2019s harder, to do and I have less muscle and less endurance and less cash\
  \ too. I want more comfort, more color, more  human and more meaningful! Than ever!\
  \  I need to fit it in NOW before time catches up.  \nSo here I sit, in my PJs,\
  \ getting over the flu, dabbing my nose and dreaming about Portugal. I imagine I\
  \ could go first class. Oh would that be nice!  A limo to my private, chartered,\
  \ luxury jet.  A massage and flowers on the plane!  The Castle in Lisbon, the four\
  \ star restaurants. I even get to meet the queen!  (Is there a queen in Portugal?)\n\
  Wait! Wake up! No one is going to give you all THAT. Well, that\u2019s OK. I don\u2019\
  t have all  that much time.  I\u2019ll take what you\u2019ve got."
