Text: "Hello, \n\nmy name is Ivelina Stoilova and for 4 years now I have been writing\
  \ poems in English ( very few in Bulgarian).\nI have collected over 500 poems on\
  \ very different topics and have aimed to always write them in rhyme.\nSome of the\
  \ verses have 3-4 passages, but some are with up to 9.\n\nI would like to share\
  \ them if this will interest you and be coherent with the requirements you have\
  \ for your candidates in this Scholarship for Travel writers.\nI am not a professional,\
  \ neither I have been mentored or published and I would like to find expert opinion\
  \ on my writing and further develop it.\n\nFurthermore, it will be both interesting\
  \ and a challenge to get to know more about writing in general and begin to create\
  \ short stories as well.\nI would like to dedicate more time on this and see with\
  \ an experienced person if I may have some chance to excel and be published one\
  \ day.\nI can even see myself doing a degree in Literature and Poetry or Writing.\n\
  \nI am looking forward to hearing back from you and sending you some of my poems\
  \ if you like to read them.\n\nThank you in advance for your time.\n\nRegards,\n\
  Ivelina Stoilova"
