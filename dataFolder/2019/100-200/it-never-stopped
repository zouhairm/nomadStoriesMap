Text: The story..The story should be completely surprising, astonishing. The road
  should never get to the point which we call the "end". Beautiful flowers, horses,
  sees, towns, mountains should be calling me around to get more explored like they  were
  waiting for a right person to do it. More coffees, different coffees, books that
  still waiting for me. Food, cheese burgers, fries, tacos and coke, I have to try
  in a different ways before taking a last breathe. Beaches, air, love, I'm all waiting
  for. I will gladly meet and welcome more colourful people as I've been waiting to
  go out and meet em. Tattoos, stories and the cultures. More events, festivals that
  has been celebrated for the legends of all time. Just waiting for the right time,
  opportunity to embrace myself. Need to gain more knowledge.
