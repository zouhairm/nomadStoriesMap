Text: "When you feel lost at the moment, take a leap in to the unkown instead of walk\
  \ in the same familiar way.\n\nTrust signs, they are dots and at the end you can\
  \ mark a Line and fine the drawing even if you don\u2019t believe in them. \n\n\
  Everything has a cost, maybe you have to left people and places you feel connected\
  \ with but they are no useful anymore.\n\nTrust the voice you want to guide in the\
  \ next step, take the risk to investe in your self and in your intention becouse\
  \ you are guided everytime even if you feel lost. \n\nGet lost in a new city and\
  \ you can find your truly self."
