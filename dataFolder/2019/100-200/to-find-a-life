Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find\u2026a life, a life in the city of Vienna, \u201C\
  the capital of outdated\u201D, a shrine of the perished glory stuffed with the artifacts\
  \ of the past, a place of everything dead as for today. Yet, it was there \u2013\
  \ a life. \n\nA life lushly burst in modern art galleries.\nA life juicily splashed\
  \ in green city parks.\nA life lazily stuck near smelling tasty \u201CW\xFCrstelstand\u201D\
  .\nA life naughtily rushed in front of the night bars.\nA life recklessly celebrated\
  \ on the attractions of Prater.\nA life busily beating between the colorful university\
  \ campuses.\n\nA life vitally existing within the dead artifacts, sharing its vitality\
  \ with them, bringing life to death.\nUnexpectedly, in a place full of dead things\
  \ the life was visible, even tangible as never before. Maybe because to truly experience\
  \ life the one has to understand the death. And being constantly surrounded by reminders\
  \ of glorious conquerors being defeated, the powerful empire being vanished and\
  \ dominant culture being faded, gives the distinct thought about life not as a result,\
  \ but as a process.\nI didn\u2019t expect to find what is life on this trip, but\
  \ instead, I found life itself in this city."
