Text: "I caught the red eye from Vancouver to Toronto. I was revisiting a city that\
  \ left me feeling indifferent to it after an earlier trip in my youth. And now,\
  \ I was returning there to meet my love. \n\nCatching up with my love in his childhood\
  \ hometown for two days after he attended his best friend\u2019s wedding, was just\
  \ meant to be a pit stop on my way to London, England. \n\nThe concrete jungle of\
  \ my memory and the yearly snow reports had me bracing for the worst when I touched\
  \ down at 6am that Sunday morning.\n\nPeering out the plane window, I was relieved\
  \ to see dry ground. \u201CText me when you land,\u201D I remember him saying, \u201C\
  and I\u2019ll tell you which train to take into the city.\u201D He had done the\
  \ planning for the both of us, found a charming Airbnb on Baldwin in the university\
  \ district, adjacent to the eclectic Kensington markets, and I was ready to see\
  \ Toronto through his eyes."
