Text: 'From the first time I walked Ireland was magical, I felt that a wonderful energy
  rose from my feet, made me jump the heart of love and my eyes were filled with happiness.


  I never feel that in my live, a lot of places around the world and beautiful but
  nothing as Dublin.


  I don''t know that is connection or beautiful green place, just I am completely
  sure that in that city make very happy and in peace so far to Bolivia my home, you
  can born in one place but belong to another.


  You too can to find your place and to feel amazing'
