Text: 'I cannot imagine myself in an interesting place than Varanasi. It is one of
  the oldest cities in India and the holiest city of Hinduism.


  Ganga river is located in Varanasi and poeple go there to take a bath, in Hinduism
  they say dipping your head in the Ganga River and clean out your sins yet the Ganga
  river is so dirty with some locals there peeing on the side and some who cannot
  afford wood to burn out their loved ones who died are just leavinf the body on the
  river.


  Many religious people come here simply to die, to be cremated on the banks of the
  Ganges, before the ashes will be handed over to the river.


  They say, this way it is possible to break out of the cycle of birth and rebirth.
  The city is full of sick people waiting for death.'
