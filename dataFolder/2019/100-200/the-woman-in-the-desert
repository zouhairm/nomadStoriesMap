Text: May 2017 when I started my journey here in Dubai, UAE. Im 21 years of age and
  no experience in travelling abroad,only the rosary and bible is in my hand. A lot
  of straggles,failures and difficulties I experience but one thing I found out every
  downwards I see in my life there's a learning and success. A life with God will
  keep you a better person and stronger than you know. Dubai is a beautiful place
  ,a place were you will not feel that your in the desert like no one will help you
  but this is the land where opportunity, helping and discover is activated. Who would
  say that a woman who is seeking for a good job is now a member of serving of the
  Lord and volunteers to others. I feel so blessed and love and the woman in the desert
  is now a servant of God.
