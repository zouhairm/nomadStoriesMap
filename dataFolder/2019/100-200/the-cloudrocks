Text: "I saw an ad about a trekking in a little town called \"Guadalcaz\xE1r\" and\
  \ it picked my interest. So I decided to call the travel agency and pay for a place\
  \ in the trekking. I wasn't expecting nothing, I got a big surprise, the place is\
  \ so beautiful, the landscape, the plants, the weather and of course the bigs rocks\
  \ all over the place. You can even see forms of animals in the rocks or how the\
  \ life open a path in the most unexpected places.\nA forest in a place where the\
  \ weather is mostly dry and with characteristics of a desert. A place with so many\
  \ things to discover and to enjoy a blissful life. \nYou can climb to the higher\
  \ rock and see all the valley, the wind in your face and the clouds under you.\n\
  There are places for camping, caves to explore and all the fresh air you can have.\n\
  This is the beautiful place called Guadalcaz\xE1r in Mexico."
