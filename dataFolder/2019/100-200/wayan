Text: "Wayan with her folk villagers gathered in one of the many antiquianted temples\
  \ by the beach of Bali. It was Hindu Day! I delightedly joined the line of ladies\
  \ wearing almost the same cuts and colors of dresses. They happily eating together\
  \ after a long wait of ceremonies and prayers, they said. As I mesmerizingly look\
  \ at them with almost unending fervor of wondering how and why these people are\
  \ so keen on their traditions. I was\u2019nt content enough to just observe, I eagerly\
  \ joined them while resting, seeing the vast sea in front of us. The wind was whispering,\
  \ almost howling. We ignored the wind. I sit beside Wayan, a lady in late 40s. She\
  \ was so accommodating to my almost umending questions. She reiterated that their\
  \ ritual of showing appreciation to their Gods had become a tradition."
