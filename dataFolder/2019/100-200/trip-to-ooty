Text: I'm Musab khan, I took a flight to Coimbatore and from there I travel to ooty
  highest peak "Doddabetta" where I find many mesmerising views, my trip to ooty is
  the best trip of my life where I found my best friend of my life, He is a local
  guy of ooty, we met at the doddabetta peak, he is selling some local stuff like
  apples in kilograms, I found it strange that apples are coming in kilogram, In my
  city Hyderabad apples are sold in quantities i.e each apple has its own price, when
  I asked him how can you sell apples in kilograms then he reply me with a smile and
  told me that "here in ooty we grew apples in some very cold places thats the reason
  why iam selling the apples in kilograms" and i asked him to for his contact. Now
  also we are in touch and these is how I got a best friend from my trip to ooty...
