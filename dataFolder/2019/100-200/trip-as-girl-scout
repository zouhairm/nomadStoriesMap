Text: It is a trip about 7 years back,I went out to a hilly area of my beloved homeland,Murree.I
  went there as a young girl scout.When I was on my way to my residence there,I was
  aspiring to learn more things,more skills and to bring improvement in my personality.But
  from the time I reached there to the time of departure,my thoughts got hell of difference
  in them.I found there,something which I never thought of finding.It made my trip
  exceptionally well.I found "myself" there...In the company of nature,I felt my "self"
  fully.The contemplation I did there was beneficial for me to find my self.
