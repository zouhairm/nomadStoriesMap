Text: 'Amazing trip comes when we hire agency to move at unknown place. But but in
  this we went to Udaipur on our own arrangements . we stay at Golden Tulip and enjoyed
  City Palace at the first day, Pichola Lake boating,

  More curious for going to Haldighati at the second day but didn''t find any arrangements
  and any source to reach there at short time with less money but a person who usually
  Driver Taxi help us to description about the Haldighati, This made us a trip more
  excited and full of new adventures. I hope the person who are reading this Travels
  story may not know the places inside India basically at Rajasthan in the city of
  Udaipur but just to explain a short brief story there are place known as the city
  of lake which is surrounded by many historical and monumental historical sites like
  Chittorgarh , Haldighati etc.


  We recently got married and planned a honeymoon trip nearby some places which also
  provide us knowledge with full of adventure as working in industries with very less
  pay so we decided to spend money not on clothes and food but just to explode the
  nearby world.'
