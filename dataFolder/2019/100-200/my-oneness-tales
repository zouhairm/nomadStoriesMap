Text: 'Travel is not just exploring a place, it''s more of exploring the world within
  oneself. From meeting new people, to experiencing diverse cultures, to tasty foods
  and nature retreats, where else would you find such ecstasy.


  More than 200 countries in the world and each one gives a unique experience. A traveler
  certainly has the best job in the universe and I certainly want to one of those
  lucky ones who would like to break the monotony of my life and jump into the everyday
  adventure of traveling and exploring different countries.


  Greece has always been on my hit-list because of its breathtaking infrastructure
  and romantic vibes. Those cozy streets, unexplored cafes and vibrant tombs leave
  me in awe everytime I come across its pictures on the internet.


  With an engineering degree, a certified fitness trainer and an inclination towards
  spirituality, I have a zeal and curiosity to know more about life, about people,
  about this world. Given the opportunities and resources, I can spend a nomadic life
  and embibe the joy and happiness that this adventure brings within me.'
