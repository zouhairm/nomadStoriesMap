Text: "It was high noon by the time I had found my way through what I had assumed\
  \ was a normal park and into a wooded area, an overgrown expanse that hid crumbling\
  \ buildings and secret caverns.\n\nAs I made my way to the farthest corner of the\
  \ park, I was surprised to stumble across what appeared to be a long ago abandoned\
  \ temple. Kept well hidden from prying eyes, the red of the temple stood out against\
  \ the lush greenery. A high staircase led to a praying platform, a spectacular view\
  \ across the Okinawan landscape. \n\nAs I turned to pray, cicadas chirped their\
  \ evening song and although I was alone, I felt completely at peace. The park had\
  \ given me a secret abode, a reprieve from the burning sun, and I sat for many moments,\
  \ listening for sounds in the silence.\n\nEventually making my way back up the long\
  \ dirt track, I stopped momentarily to listen to the chimes of bells attached to\
  \ a closed kiosk. Unexpectedly I had found my own paradise among the trees."
