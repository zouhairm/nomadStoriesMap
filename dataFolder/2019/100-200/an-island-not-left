  \ continent of Australia and I\u2019m 30 this year!!\n\nHow depressing, I know.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s been my life long goal to go overseas, other than Kangaroo Island.\
  \ - google maps if you\u2019re not too sure on the geography. \n\nWith life and\
  \ tough times teaching some difficult lessons, proving equally difficult to save\
  \ and travel.\n\nI\u2019d be ever so great full for this opportunity- with my partner\
  \ in hand. \nTo which, she can stop giving me so much grief about not travelling\
  \ anywhere and anyone else who looks at me like I don\u2019t use toilet paper for\
  \ my bum.\n\nTo win this and have a bucket list goal ticked off. \n\nWould be life\
  \ changing me."
