Text: "I'm an archeologist and I was working at Cob\xE1 Quintana Roo, but after weeks\
  \ of hard job, when I finished, I decided to  go to Cozumel because I needed  vacations.\
  \ \nWhen I arrived at Cozumel I  didn't know what to do, so I looked for options\
  \ and after of visited and enjoy the island and decided to go to \"el  cielo\" beach\
  \ which is beautiful, is a  real contact Whit the nature, I was some hours there,\
  \ I watched fishes, stingrays and sea stars, the next day I had a historical and\
  \ archaeological day, I went to archaeological zones, and museums.\nFinally I went\
  \ to Tulum, another archeological zone and I enjoy the Tulum  beach.\nI really love\
  \ to travel and discover new places  and of course I love to learn about the places\
  \ and the world."
