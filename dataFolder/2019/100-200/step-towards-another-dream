Text: "Being a travel freek took me to travel different places in India. A land of\
  \ mythological stories,  battles, invaders and birth place of many genius people.\
  \ India faced lots of problems and issues but still stand strong to be at its best.\
  \ My travel journey took me to a place Beyond my imagination that is Leh,situated\
  \ in the crown of India at J&K.My whole week journey begin with stromy weather.But\
  \ the beauty of the city draged me towards it. Forced me to think how nature stores\
  \ beauty in it. Starting from pagoda,moving for local food and interaction. Attraction\
  \ of blue water of pang gong lake force me to say simply 'wow'. The add-on beauty\
  \ and my favorite is nubra valley the cold desert and attractive double humped camel\
  \ ride. For staying I enjoyed the tent life with all required things. After visiting\
  \ this place juat realized how important is nature for us. This place is actually\
  \ a must visit place for once. \nTravelling in India is a great experience of living.\
  \ The royal trains also helps to explore the city. Country of golden heart with\
  \ smile on its face."
