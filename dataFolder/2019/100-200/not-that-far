Text: "Everyone told me to do things, things that I really didn\u2019t understand\
  \ at the time.\nMy mom, my sister, my aunts, all female power in my family said\
  \ to be ok with the differences between boys and girls, how we are raised, how do\
  \ we work, every single difference of gender, I had to acept it. \nBut I\u2019m\
  \ done, that\u2019s why I started writing about everything and nothing. I wrote\
  \ a speech that will be mind blowing, telling everyone that we are equals and we\
  \ need to understand that.\nMy speech is about women all over the world and the\
  \ power of feminism in the world, this concept for a lot of us is a leap in to the\
  \ unknown. I look on the internet every single country where women and \u201Cdifferent\u201D\
  \ from men are seen like an object. \nI travel to the world on my mind, to the world\
  \ I dream every night with, the world where everyone is free and they are not judged\
  \ by others. This is the world that I want for my grandchildren, full of sun and\
  \ respect. That\u2019a why i have to go and show everyone my speech."
