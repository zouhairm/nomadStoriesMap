Text: "It's about a young woman who was living with a veteran who had ptsd in the\
  \ states. One night (2013), the love of her life almost killed her. She defended\
  \ herself, but he changed the story and she was deported back to Mexico leaving\
  \ behind her 4 year old son. No one of her \xA8friends\xA8 were anywhere to be seen.\
  \ She only had her mom by her side. The first few years were dark and she was consumed\
  \ by depression. The feeling of never being able to walk the streets of where she\
  \ grew up, knowing that her son would grow up without her, caused her endless nights\
  \ of crying herself to sleep. Slowly, she began transforming into a completely different\
  \ person. Thanks to everything she had went through, she became wiser, more careful,\
  \ and happier; completely rewired. \n\nI would include my short lived and abusive\
  \ marriage to a man I met on a dating site (2015). \nI would also include my 2 ayahuasca\
  \ ceremonies (2018)."
