Text: "My husband and I have traveled to Belize seven times. After our 3rd trip I\
  \ decided to rent a bicycle for the stay. What a difference \na set of wheels make!\
  \  Don\u2019t get me wrong, Belizeans are friendly and welcoming to tourists. After\
  \ all their economy relies on the tourist dollar.\nThat being said, once I was on\
  \ a bicycle, my whole experience changed. I was suddenly treated like an islander.\
  \ Merchants were helpful and so accommodating. After all, all I had to carry my\
  \ groceries was a basket. More then one grocer offered to deliver my items. Sitting\
  \ outside drinking an espresso, with my bicycle next to me, nearly all of the people\
  \ acknowled me with a hello or a tip of their hat.  I was taken aback when a local\
  \ held my bicycle while I went to collect my laundry. \nAnother interesting aspect\
  \ of riding a bicycle was the tourist approaching me with general questions. Tourists\
  \ don\u2019t ride bicycles I guess? \nWe will return to Belize as it is a favorite\
  \ of ours. However, a bicycle is a requirement for me. Surprise, surprise I have\
  \ even gotten my husband to rent a bicycle as well."
