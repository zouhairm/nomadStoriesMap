Text: For some people, travelling means walking on foot to discover new and exquisite
  places, or living in with the locals and learning new culture but for me, it was
  a mixture of both. I am currently in Australia for some studies and this journey
  has not only been a change of culture and knowledge but it has been a drastic learning
  process of my getting to know my self. This has been a self discovery most international
  student goes through and it's a choice and risk that not all people may be able
  to grasp. But everyday, I discover and learn new things about me that I never knew
  existed. Most of the time, I feel more and more frustrated and angry about myself
  but day by day, I learn to fully accept the things that I cannot change and learn
  the game of being honest with myself. I think that travelling deeper inside myself
  is way harder than travelling outside places but either way, they take you to a
  different dimension and make you a different version of yourself.
