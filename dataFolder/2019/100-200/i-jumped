Text: 'I jumped, consequently fell. When I fell, I opened my eyes and saw a new world.
  Full of colors and experiences calling my name. I hugged everything with strength
  and claw, for this fall showed me a world that I wanted to discover, a new world.

  With 20 years and few experiences, the Argentine colors and stories catch my eye,
  it fascinates me, because despite being Brazilian and there is an old rivalry in
  football, I have always admired the Argentines and all their culture. A Latin American
  country, with wonderful people, with an education to make envy in any other country.
  It was there where it fell (figuratively) and I got up. I got even stronger, because
  everything around me gave me the strength and will to face all that.

  A beautiful trip, that enriches me and still, even far, enriches.

  Soon I, a Brazilian of 20 years, seeking refuge in Argentine soil, seems even a
  joke, but it is true. A beautiful truth, just like the Argentine country.'
