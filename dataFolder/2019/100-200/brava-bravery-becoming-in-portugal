Text: 'There once was a girl who took a leap of faith to fufill a journey of becoming
  through the magical charm of Sintra and the coast of Portugal.


  She had left her job, given two months notice with no solid plan in mind but to
  enrich herself in a new cultural experience and to perhaps learn a new language.
  Her bosses were sad to see her go but they celebrated her desire to travel and her
  ambition to make her soul happy.


  She set flight arriving in Lisbon and what a glorious journey that awaited her!
  Perhaps ''kicking the soccer ball foward'' was the best decision she had ever made.'
