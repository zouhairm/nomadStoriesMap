Text: "Here, at the beach with the colorful name of GOLDEN BEACH, we met RAM. Since\
  \ a couple of years now, he comes to the beach to sell cold drinks and snacks. The\
  \ surfers trust him, leaving their belongings with him while catching waves.\n\n\
  We are not experienced surfers, but experienced beach-goers. So, we sit down and\
  \ watch the surfers doing their job. Ram constantly picks up the trash at the beach.\
  \ Once he\u2019s bored, he sits next to us and starts chatting.\n\n\u201CI always\
  \ have to clean up. Nobody else does. The trash comes from the sea, some tourist\
  \ forget their trash as well. It\u2019s annoying, but I do not want to have this\
  \ beautiful beach dirty.\u201Dwe felt shy by his words because everyone living in\
  \ this have some responsibility ram was doing very good job .\nCleaning the beach\
  \ is important thing because no one take care about that everyone throwing trash\
  \ on the beach"
