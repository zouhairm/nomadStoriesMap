Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find a city such cultural and historical throughout\
  \ the streets of Porto. In my 10 hours transit to Lisbon I tried to use the time\
  \ and discover the cities most interesting places. I walk down and up, passed by\
  \ the ruined district of ribeira, where the most important river Douro flows in\
  \ to the Atlantic Ocean. The bridges around the city makes the city even more beautiful.\
  \ Sometimes I thought the building are about to fall apart. They are so old, older\
  \ than I ever thought. With a very pretty sunset ended the short stay and the adventure\
  \ of Lisbon began."
