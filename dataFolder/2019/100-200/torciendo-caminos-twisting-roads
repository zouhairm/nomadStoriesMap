Text: "We are a couple from Argentina and Spain, looking for their path in this world.\
  \ Or rather, twisting it. We were the classic workers looking forward to the holidays.\
  \ Moved by other traveling couples and especially by our monotonous life we \u200B\
  \u200Bdecided in 3 months to leave everything and go out to travel. In addition\
  \ to tourism we are doing volunteer work, learning new things, things we never thought\
  \ we were going to do, how to work the country in Brazil or help build a yoga center\
  \ in Mexico. And here we continue, on our trip, which is also an inner journey to\
  \ get to know each other, investigate ourselves, learn and see if we are lucky enough\
  \ to know what we want in our way."
