Text: "Everything is dark all of the sudden I can\u2019t find any light, everything\
  \ is heavy around me it is everywhere the glitches of life, the shadows of heavy\
  \ unhappy heart. Tears burns my cheeks I\u2019m purple and I closed my eyes flood\
  \ of tears rolling down and as they meet in my cheen a spike of a profound thought\
  \ strike my brain. Deep forest in the middle of no where large mountains long trees,\
  \ glass house sunset light gloaming in my face. Right in there I felt deepest peace\
  \ and a wooden fresh air smell and a chilly wind hugging me. A LEAP TO THE UNKNOWN\
  \ in my thoughts. How I wish it was for really. An escape to the unknown."
