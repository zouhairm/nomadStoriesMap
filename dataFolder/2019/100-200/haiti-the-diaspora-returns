Text: 'My story concerns the anxiety inducing yet spiritually nourishing experience
  that diaspora populations face upon returning to the land of their ancestors. My
  family is originally from Haiti and I was the first in my family to be born in the
  United States. Throughout my childhood, we traveled to Haiti regularly. But after
  a certain age and especially after the 2010 earthquake, we never did return. I spent
  my teenage years and college career wondering what I was missing out on, practicing
  our native tongue with whomever I could find so I wouldn''t lose the skill, and
  trying to infiltrate predominantly Haitian social groups in my community, fearful
  that I might be viewed as an outsider.


  My story is one of encouragement. One of fear that is overcome. One of pride. And
  one of a long term commitment to a place no matter how complicated its existence
  may be.'
