Text: It was my first time travelling to the south and outside northern region with
  some few students and teachers.We were travelling to the Central region to witness
  an excellence award ceremony for all colleges nationwide. After the  awards at university
  of Cape Coast , our teachers decided to send us for  supper at a local restaurant
  popularly known as 'bush canteen' to most of the university students.  I bought
  Banku and Palm nut soup and when I asked about the meat price ,the woman replied,
  'Goat meat is 4 cedis and fish is 2 cedis'. I was completely taken aback, a goat
  meat is expensive in some parts of Ghana. It is the cheapest meat in northern region
  aside horse meat . My friend and I quickly exchange glances and bought the fish
  instead. When we return  from the journey, I stare at goats in my community and
  tell myself that a bronze in Tamale can be a Gold in Cape Coast.
