Text: Comming from Germany, a country I am always happy to be in, me and my friends
  arrived in the misterious and not much explored region of Transylvannia. There we
  could ski, visit old castles, however the most interesting and joyful thing I have
  seen was a circle of the hotel employees dancing in a circle something that seemed
  to be a local folk tradition. I really felt happy With them and my day was somehow
  blessed. I remmembered old Alpine parties even though I was in the Carpatian Mountains.
  That said, The old continent winds are indeed refreshing and this visit to Central
  and Eastern Europe worths a great movie.
