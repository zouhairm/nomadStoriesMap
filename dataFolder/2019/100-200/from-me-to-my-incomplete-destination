Text: OK so it all begins when a traveller has more expectation from his journey.
  It was a month of November and I decided to travel from Pune to Nashik. Just packed
  my bags and all set to leave for Nashik. Nashik,city of pilgrimage and also 3rd
  biggest city of Maharashtra (one of the state in India) to see some of the beautiful
  places. While travelling traveller always expect something new to find while travel.
  OK so I was on my way to Nashik and was travelling through Bus and on half of my
  journey driver informed that due to some issue (riots) bus can't enter to Nashik.It
  was a big dissappointment for me but I was having no choice. It was almost 1:45
  at night and the place where I was at place called Sinnar. Every journey shows some
  new phase of life and that night I found something really peaceful that was silence.
