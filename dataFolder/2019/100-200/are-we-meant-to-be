Text: "It all started 2 years ago un Cancun, Mexico. \nIt was my end of shool trip,\
  \ all fun and games. One night left, abd i met him. Josh. The beautiful australian\
  \ guy who asked if we could share a cab who was coincidentally staying in the same\
  \ hotel as me, just a coincidence?, the love of my life?, my soulmate? Thats what\
  \ i wondered for a year after meeting him. \n\u201CHe lives in the opposite side\
  \ of the world\u201D \u201Cim never going to see him again, and bisides he probably\
  \ forgot about me\u201D \u201Cit was just a one time hookup\u201D those were the\
  \ thoughts in my mind to be able to forget my match made in heaven (or at least\
  \ thats what I thought at the time). Until suddenly, one year after meeting, i sent\
  \ him a text to see how he was doing and, to be honest, try and get closure. Things\
  \ started going well and one day, we realize we were both going to be in Europe\
  \ at the same time... \n(Based on a true story)"
