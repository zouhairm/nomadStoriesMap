Text: "Every place has their off-the-beaten-track hidden gems that are not always\
  \ found in guidebooks. Others can be found in guidebooks but slip by the wayside\
  \ for not being easily accessible or on the usual routes. Sri Lanka has some special\
  \ and amazing places that you didn\u2019t know existed. These amazing places will\
  \ find more attraction by the people who wants to explore and hope this story will\
  \ inspire them to have their next visit to the teardrop island.\n\nA diverse island\
  \ with many experiences to offer both locals and visitors, it\u2019s quite hard\
  \ to believe that this tiny island still has many gems to be discovered. Rising\
  \ as a favorite of tourists, Sri Lanka offers a variety of tour options from wildlife\
  \ safaris to romantic getaways. As the country\u2019s popularity increases, famous\
  \ attractions are filled with tourists which might get a bit overwhelming\nTherefore\
  \ my travel story will be based on the special locations in Sri Lanka yet unknown\
  \ and explain why it\u2019s so much special with history and also folk stories rally\
  \ round it as well.\n\nI intend planning to have 10 best special places to be visited\
  \ in Sri Lanka and my story will be based on those locations"
