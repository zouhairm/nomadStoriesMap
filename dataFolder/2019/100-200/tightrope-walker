Text: "\"Omnia mea mecum porto\"\nB\xEDas de Priene\nI carry all my things with me.\
  \ This is the phrase of a life tightrope walker who travels and not only moves geographically\
  \ but mainly travels towards people. Finding herself and finding herself in the\
  \ hearts of other people.\nThere are always challenges that make her stagger in\
  \ the daily game of life: balance. Necessary to not die. And also risky to face\
  \ the fact that makes us equal to all: death.\nSo what is life?, and what is death?\
  \ When are you really living, and in the present? It is that human encounter perhaps,\
  \ the high point of the beauty of living. In this challenging and enriching walk,\
  \ the tightrope walker only takes what is necessary to dance on the imaginary rope\
  \ that demands balance in life, her heart, and maybe she discovers that she has\
  \ something else to taste and share in the path."
