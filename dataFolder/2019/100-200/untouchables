Text: "This is the story about locals. About people being in a place for a lifetime.\
  \ About customs, ways of life, moments of internal peace inside their rutines.\n\
  The smell of orange blossom while waking up at 06.00 am everyday, as a moment of\
  \ excitement that only who does it know. \nLooking with tired eyes, in the most\
  \ colourful and perfect place in the world, where it seems the time stopped, not\
  \ just once. \nThe unbelievable moment when the dinner is ready,and the old, hunched\
  \ and smily lady take a break to smoke a cigarrete.\nThe walks into the wild, where\
  \ several street dogs wait for a human touch ,even wounded still faithful to their\
  \ unbreakable honest instinct."
