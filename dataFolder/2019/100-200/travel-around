Text: Travel Around is the best choose when we don't have enough money to go and having
  little time for spending holiday. Many garden city, delicious food, different event/communities
  can we find them in big city like Surabaya. I didn't expect to find beauty view
  of sunset in the street, so lucky I look them and taking photo with mobile phone.
  Another reason I like travel around because I like many food and finding joy with
  different perspective. I recommend to come Zangrandi ice cream because it is very
  famous on Surabaya City, Indonesia. Favorite ice cream like chocolate, vanilla,
  and strawberry flavors are yummy.  If you visit Surabaya, you can come to Yos Sudarso
  Number 15 street. You can feel it, ordinary ice cream with taste and history. They
  develop business ice cream so they can survive until now. We can learn too from
  their perspective and strategic they make when we seeing their store on shopping
  mall and keep taste feel goods.
