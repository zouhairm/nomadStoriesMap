Text: When I'm traveling to somewhere else, I'm usually explain the place with fiction
  writing. For example, my character is originally Turkish, when she went to somewhere
  else she's explain what she find interesting about the place. It might be museums,
  culture, people,food, language etc. I'm trying to write from different perspective
  and how it's different compare the rest of the places.  My last work was about New
  York. My character was trying to adapt to New York. I wrote everything what I found
  interesting New York.  When people read my work, they found really interesting.
  Especially people who from New York find really interesting because they never look
  at New York from tourist perspective. As I mentioned before I want to explain places
  from different perspectives.
