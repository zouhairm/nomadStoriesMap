  kei island.  Over there, if you're lucky you will meet the pelicans who transmigration
  from Aussie. Beside that the special moment too was enjoy the beach you're looking
  arround and for your informartion the sands here was the softest white sand beach
  in Asia for sure. Not far from there, you will found one of main destinations located
  in kei island too beside the beach, Named is Hawang Cave. Inside Hawang cave is
  pond there is bluish clear water allowing you to see the rocks underneath clearly.
  Hawang cave is divided into two different caves connected by an underground river.
  You can go to both caves and dive through the connecting river. I guess, it may

  and I'm personally asking for you to come to my country and enjoy the beautiful
