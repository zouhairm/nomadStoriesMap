Text: i was a high school at the time and i was not sure who i was. there was so much
  i did not know about me that i had to look for. the places in some of the cities
  and towns that i went to were life changing for a young teen. i felt my self worth
  when i went to France when i was trying to buy something and i only had pounds and
  not the current bills that i needed to buy the thing that i had wanted. but there
  was other things that i was able to get without feeling like some one stupid or
  something else. in the end though i was glad that i could do something on my own
  for once.
