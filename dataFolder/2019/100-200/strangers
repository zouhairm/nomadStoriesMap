Text: It's a fairy-tale realistic kind of story. The tale of a girl dealing with mental
  illness who's trying to find balance and a sense of belonging in this world. She
  travels everywhere and meeting people that are like her and she's trying to get
  close in moments of vulnerability. She's falling in love by mirroring the people
  that she meets in her trip but she finds out it is not real. Her feelings, the connection
  is not authentic. And the truth is about creating herself through lessons that universe
  has to offer. She is alone most of the time, she needs to learn how to stand on
  her feet. She learns how to love herself. She learns who she is through pain and
  suffering on a lonely path. A woman that wants everything because she never wanted
  anything enough. The noise in her head unfolds in the reality she encounters.
