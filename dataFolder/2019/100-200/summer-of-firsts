Text: "I was used to traveling every year to Spain to spend my summer holidays. I\
  \ always met new people, visited new places and tried new foods. This particular\
  \ year I didn't have any set plans for the summer and just 2 days into the trip\
  \ I met someone through social media and went on a date. That night was without\
  \ a doubt one of the best nights of my life, because I made one of the greatest\
  \ connections of my life, and I experienced love at first sight. That night went\
  \ from a simple drink to going around different bars and clubs in Madrid having\
  \ a blast and finished on a rooftop watching the sunrise. From there the whole summer\
  \ I spent getting to know him more and more, spending almost  every day together\
  \  and andtably falling for him. \n\nIt is still one of the best summers of my life,\
  \ and although I had to go back and the summer fling came to an end I will always\
  \ treasure that trip and remember it fondly."
