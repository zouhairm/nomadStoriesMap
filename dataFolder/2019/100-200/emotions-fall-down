Text: 'As I''m a college student just occupied in the assignments and tests which
  make my life dull and full of tension the only way I can connect with people and
  local people which give me a sense of joy and happiness. I visited Kashmir that
  place was amazing with lots of walnuts and other dry fruits as I''m foody and human
  being I love to eat and travel as it''s a basic necessities

  In this world and the people when I inter acted with local people as I want to buy
  good stuff in a more cheap rate as my pockets allow me that''s the way I think I''m
  living in the reality than a virtual world. I hope that I continue with my passion
  and desire to love nature and the people around it. As a part of my journey I experienced
  shared here.'
