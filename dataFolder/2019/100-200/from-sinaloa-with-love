Text: "I went to Caracas from Sinaloa to be part of a voluntary of AIESEC. I didn't\
  \ knew what to expect because all the news and social media's post, but it was such\
  \ an inspiring aventure since Day 1. I was truly commited to push myself to the\
  \ limit and also to move others, i ended traveling a cross the country meeting all\
  \ kind of amazing People,  trying knew foods, hearing amazing stories and doing\
  \ a lot of crazy stuff like giving a speech to convince soldiers to let us enjoy\
  \ a tur\xEDstic ride. I felt in love with Venezuela and its People, learned a lot\
  \ about the True meaning of happiness and life meaning. Its all about connect and\
  \ help other while they also do the same with you."
