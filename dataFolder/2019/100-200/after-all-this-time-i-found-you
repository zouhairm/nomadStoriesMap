  \ still can\u2019t decide which one, put you in front of the person you\u2019ve\
  \ always been dreaming about but just for one night...Well, that happened to me\
  \ last December, I met the guy of my dreams but the next day I had to came back\
  \ to Mexico and he kept doing his tour trough Colombia and then he went back to\
  \ Austria, it was just one night thing, we gave each other\u2019s number and followed\
  \ in instagram but that\u2019s it.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than one year and we keep\
  \ talking almost every day but I don\u2019t know if I will see him again and being\
  \ honest it\u2019s the only thing that keeps spinning my head over and over again."
