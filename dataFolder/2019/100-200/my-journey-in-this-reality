Text: 'The day of the flight that sun was shining more that usual, and my eyes too,
  foot a person who hasn''t had the experience to travel out of his country, this
  day is for remember. In our lives what we do, is what we are, I think in the last
  day of my in this earth, and in the day after that, just everyone will keep with
  their life''s, but what do I get of life in this reality? What''s do I learned?
  I think that everyone knows what they really want cause all we have a heart and
  a mind, the heart can tells us what''s is love, make''s you fell fear, or many other
  feeling''s, and the mind is like our conscience, can let you know if something is
  wrong or good for you or the world.


  So, I want to follow my heart and my mind, to really live the experiences that I
  need to live and learn what I most to learn, I want to help the people, and Heald
  the world.'
