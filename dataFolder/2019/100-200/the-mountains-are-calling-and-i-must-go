Text: "A leap of faith, fear, and finding myself. Spontaneously, yes, unplanned, I\
  \ purchased a flight to the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada to ommence my courageous\
  \ journey in search for something more. In the midst of closely finishing my undergraduate\
  \ degree, somehow balancing four jobs, and exasperating adult responsibilities,\
  \ I found myself consistently dreaming of getting away; a fresh start, and what\
  \ better place than somewhere you have never experienced. There\u2019s something\
  \ so peacefully gratifying in dropping everything (quite literally) and moving across\
  \ the country without knowing a single soul, where you\u2019ll end up, and who you\
  \ will become. Little to my knowledge, I was going to not only make life-long friendships,\
  \ and travel in some of the most beautiful places in Canada, but also learn some\
  \ valuable life lessons, and find who I am as a person. This life is beautiful;\
  \ there is so much to learn and see, and I dare each and every one of you to go\
  \ beyond your comfort zones and live it."
