Text: 'Philippines...a city of islands i would say. Never thought a family trip could
  ever turn out to be such a joyride. From the raining men in o bar to a winning streak
  at the casino streak. Scuba dive and the happy tears, coron island and the discovery
  of the hidden island, from learning the art of bargaining in n boracay to the overly
  polite and civilized people there the city is filled with not just one but a bunch
  of stories that i can never forget. Want to hear about al of them and more from
  my bali excursion too just choose me for the scholarship i need the right mentor
  to get my potential polished the right way.
