Text: Most of travellers whant to go to the famois Rio in Brazil, but nobody knows
  that close this busy and attractive city an smal and unique town is waitin to be
  discover. You dont need too much time just catch a bus or rent a car to discover
  this amazing and historical city called Parati. I get lost all the time that i try
  to go there. Is like i get deep into another dimension and the people who surround
  yourself as well. You can fell it in the air, in the magic of its river which go
  down quitly and slightly shy around the city looking forward to find the sea
