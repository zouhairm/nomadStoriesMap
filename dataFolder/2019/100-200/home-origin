Text: I am hoping to get a trip to Portugal so that I can touch roots with the ones
  I love. My family is Portuguese and I have had the opportunity to go to Portugal
  once before many years ago, it would be lovely to be able to visit again. I would
  love to emerge myself fully into their culture and explore the land to the fullest!
  I know my family would welcome me with open arms and help me get more in touch with
  my roots. The lands of Portugal are so vibrant and beautiful, anyone who has the
  chance to go there I guarantee will have an amazing time surrounded by such beautiful
  scenery.
