Text: "All happened is rush. Took the bus to the nearest Best Buy and grabbed the\
  \ parrot with a question. The nect think I remember is in a flight back to home\
  \ which is Malaysia \U0001F1F2\U0001F1FE. It was my summer break and I needed some\
  \ pure time with family and \U0001F30A.  After gaining around 10 pounds or more,\
  \ family of 4 were on the way to airport catch the flight to Thailand \U0001F1F9\
  \U0001F1ED early morning. Phi Phi island \U0001F334 was the goal. A smooth sea never\
  \ made a skilled sailor said Mr Roosevelt.  The ocean\u2019s current was testing\
  \ out patience for the waiting food in the sea side by the shop after the fresh\
  \ sea water swim. The moment I felt sand I unleashed my parrot and I saw paradise\
  \ up there was magical. Every since then I have been working how to move myself\
  \ into the next level. I wanna see what did Mr Vasco da Gama born from. I thank\
  \ my parents and for the opportunity given. Have a great day \u2764\uFE0F"
