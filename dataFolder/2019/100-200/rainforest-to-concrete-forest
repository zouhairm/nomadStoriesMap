Text: 'I''m twenty years old, last year I did the unthinkable.

  I gave up my relaxing life in Hawaii and decided to move to one of the biggest cities
  in the world.

  I figured that if I can make it and thrive in a place where everything including
  the language is forigen to me, I can make it anywhere and do anything, AND THAT
  IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

  I moved to challenge myself, to test my limits, to see what I am made of in a sense.

  Every day is how it should be, challenging, filled with curiosity and excitement.

  I found myself doing things I never would of thought I would have done, wether that
  be volunteering with children, or even becoming a teacher.

  From a young age, I always knew that I wanted to live abroad and here I am not never
  twenty one years old, I am living in one of the greatest places In the world. The
  jobs, Friends, and opportunities that I was presented with gave me a new outlook
  on life.


  My story is an inspiration to me and everyone around me.'
