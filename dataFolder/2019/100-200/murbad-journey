Text: A friend of mine who's travelled many parts of India asked me to join him to
  his trip to Nirnay(see my recent instagram posts - musiconik). At the first I was
  like I can see that on internet. I was too lazy and confused whether to go or not.
  I accompanied him. We went by car and the beauty I saw after reaching there was
  mesmerizing. The greenery, the pure water of lakes and dams, the animals, the food
  quality which we don't get in cities. Then I decided to travel more and went to
  a few forts and beaches. Then I had a tough time fighting jaundice, that too twice.
  Now that I'm okay and fit to travel, I've many places in my mind to go. Europe is
  one of them and your post came across. This made me write. If my words seem to be
  impressive, I would love to visit Portugal and know the place and pen it down. Looking
  forward for an opportunity from you. Thanks - Janakraj
