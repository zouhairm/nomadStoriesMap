Text: "\u201CI decided to call myself \u2018Nostalgie Eternelle\u2019 because I like\
  \ the sound of it and it aptly depicts how I feel during the Carnival. I get lost\
  \ in the piazzas of Venezia and time travel 20 years back.\u201D\n\nI was playing\
  \ football with a family of four at Campo Santa Margherita. It seemed like the obvious\
  \ way to get over last night\u2019s frivolities. I took a siesta from the five-year-olds\
  \ to give my dreary eyes some rest, whilst my friends were calling me over to join\
  \ them for brunch. I got up in a few minutes because the birds didn\u2019t let me\
  \ be at peace as I have had my share of pigeons defecating incidents. Over the years,\
  \ my reasons to stay out through the night have evolved. When at home, I did it\
  \ for the honey ginger tea with homemade biscotti but otherwise, the only silver\
  \ lining is the fact I introspect the next morning. Perhaps, the only time I am\
  \ obeying my brother\u2019s advice to actively do it. While lingering over to Pizza\
  \ e Rist\xF2 Da Michele for lunch, my mind was prancing through my childhood to\
  \ remind me of the times when I used to be called \u2018Chinese\u2019 owing to my\
  \ tiny eyes.\n\nWith confetti flying around the whole island, it seemed like the\
  \ Gods want to overlook the massive ecological disaster taking place in Venice.\
  \ I was surprised at my conclusion of the mask festival being high up on God\u2019\
  s priorities. My chain of thought had an abrupt halt when amongst the sea of masks,\
  \ one brought me to a complete standstill. With the sunlight seeping through tiny\
  \ spaces to fall on its dress and the wind helping in setting up the strands as\
  \ the perfect bokeh element, I gleefully captured the fleeting moment. During lunch,\
  \ I showed the picture to my friends and they were equally amazed but the food was\
  \ much more arresting. So, I started daydreaming with my mind racing at high speeds,\
  \ trying to answer difficult life questions. But amongst all of this, the pertinent\
  \ question was, how do I find it difficult to photograph people back in India but\
  \ do it effortlessly in Italy? My senses traveled a couple of weeks back, to the\
  \ time when I met Emilia. It was a precocious spring day at Genga and we had some\
  \ time before the tour of Frasassi Caves. Having heard of the local crusty, soft\
  \ bread, Crescia, we wanted to have a slice of it. Being an extrovert, I struck\
  \ a conversation with the lady and tried to know her story because selling food\
  \ in the middle of nowhere did not fit her attire. She told me how this job is a\
  \ forced one to pay the medical expenses for her husband. She likes it now as it\
  \ gives her a chance to live happier lives through the stories of the gregarious\
  \ lot who visit the caves. While leaving, the giant mountains behind the store seemed\
  \ like guardians of her soul. I quickly went back to capture the glint in her eyes\
  \ before spending the rest of the day admiring the stalagmites of Frasassi.\n\n\
  A few days back, my picture of the masked man from Venice was trending on Instagram\
  \ and around 4 pm, I got a new message request notification from Charles. My head\
  \ went dizzy with excitement and my heart was in awe of the power of social media.\
  \ It was incredible! The kid in me sprung up and I tried to know as much as possible\
  \ about him. Through his stories and his reasons for calling himself the Eternal\
  \ Nostalgia, I felt as if I was in a similar place. It felt all of us are in a similar\
  \ place. Nostalgia is what binds your past to your future and the present being\
  \ the infinite string to hold them together. I hope I don\u2019t have to break up\
  \ with Italy once I am done with my internship because I am already in love! In\
  \ the words of William Yeats, \"O no, my dear, let all that be; what matters, so\
  \ there is but fire, in you, in me?\""
