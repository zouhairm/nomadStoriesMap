Text: "Amma\u2019s eyes slowly moved from the crescent moon of curiosity to wide-eyed\
  \ realization. The small, lacey piece of material she had discovered whilst folding\
  \ away her washing was in fact a burgundy thong. Nervous glances were exchanged\
  \ across the dinner table as the silence electrified the warm air, and rice, cemented\
  \ together by Amma\u2019s mellow and flavoursome Dahl, slipped through our fingers\
  \ as we watched and waited. In one swift move she tucked the thong back underneath\
  \ the washing and raced for the bathroom. \n \nWhat had we done? Had we sent such\
  \ shock through our sweet and conservative Amma, who had insisted we call her the\
  \ Sinhala word for Mother and in return she called us daughter, that she was no\
  \ longer able to be in our presence. \n \nAmma, who had beckoned us to \u2018come-en,\
  \ sit-en, eat-en\u2019 as soon as we reached her door for for the first time, emphatically\
  \ demonstrating each action; had slipped ginger in our tea when she knew before\
  \ our own bodies did, that we may be run down and getting a cold; who delighted\
  \ in wrapping as like newborns in swaddling bands into her kaleidoscope of material,\
  \ when we were curious about her saris.  \n \nTen minutes passed and she emerged\
  \ from the bathroom, freshly showered, hair soaking in a coconut oil mask and in\
  \ long pajamas. A slight sense of shock and anticipation lifted when we rationalized\
  \ that she had use her time in the bathroom to also shower and not just stand in\
  \ a stunned silence. She paused at the head of the table, scanning her gaze over\
  \ our non-reciprocating eyes as though we\u2019ve cheated in a test. The setting\
  \ sun burning the sky red through the window behind her, and the air filled with\
  \ the low and soft tones of monks blessing the evening offerings of faithful Buddhists.\
  \ \n \n\u2018They are yours\u2019 she points across the table to Hannah, a confident\
  \ girl zapped of her usual cheekiness. \u2018They\u2019re not mine!\u2019 Hannah\
  \ proclaims and passed the spotlight with a point to the shy Sophia, cheeks quickly\
  \ reddening. She slowly looks up at Amma who teeth have burst forward in a jubilant\
  \ smile. \u2018They are very, very small\u2019 she giggles as she demonstrated two\
  \ small butt cheeks with her hands. The silence is broken and the room erupts with\
  \ laughter. Amma\u2019s giggle leading the way in relaxing the atmosphere. \n \n\
  Amma suddenly disappears again into her room as we all gather ourselves and what\
  \ has happened. Suddenly, she throws back the curtain that acts as a door to her\
  \ room, holding a larger material \u2018Mine\u2019 she jubilantly proclaims \u2018\
  Mine, daughter, mine\u2019 as she waves her underwear around the room. Her face\
  \ changes again once more as she sees our full plates of food \u2018Kanna! Kanna\u2019\
  \ (Eat! Eat!) the frivolity vanishing as she becomes more concerned that we won\u2019\
  t eat if our food goes cold."
