Text: "\"Where are the dykes at?\" \nThat is the question I do not ask. Instead, I\
  \ ask the nice, white lady at the hostel's reception: \n\"What gay bars do you recommend?\"\
  \ \nShe is vague; after all, Brighton, England is full of them. \nI walk the way\
  \ she (vaguely) directed, bloody period in my panties, fresh tattoo shrink-wrapped\
  \ in plastic. The air is clear and bright and real. I feel okay. Maybe I even feel\
  \ good. \nThe first two clubs turn up nothing but nice, white, gay men who all dance\
  \ better than me. They have no idea where lesbians go to meet lesbians. I'm not\
  \ even sure I'm a lesbian, but I know if I'm going home with anyone tonite, they're\
  \ going to be a woman. \nI'm ready to call it quits along the pier. The sun sinks\
  \ into a hollow, pearl-grey sea. The sunset is probably gorgeous, but I'm looking\
  \ at my feet.  \n\"I got the job! I got the job!\" laughs a guy into his mobile.\
  \ He is so happy at the prospect of a job that I feel like a spoiled shit for moaning\
  \ over my Am-I-Aren't-I Queer Conundrum. \nHe hangs up and invites me to, \"Come\
  \ join the party!\" So I do.  \nI soon find out his name is Dillon: another nice,\
  \ white, gay man (\"Though,\" he admits, \"I'm partial to eating pussy.\") He is\
  \ blazing drunk. I am in love with his rebellious innocence. \nWhen I inform him\
  \ of my quest, he elects himself as my faithful, blitzed guide, practically dragging\
  \ me to two other gay bars where we meet flirty drag queens, and he takes personal\
  \ offence at my refusal to drink.  \nMy hunt for love devolves into babysitting.\
  \ He walks into a betting station and humps the straight guy watching telly. By\
  \ the time we're back on the street, I'm literally dragging him away from strangers.\
  \ \n\"Hi!\" he accosts a woman with a friendly shout, but she's glad to have grabbed\
  \ his attention. A guy that handsome can get away with almost anything. \nAlmost.\
  \ \n\"Can I help you?\" \n\"We're looking for pussy... vaginas...\"  \nThe look\
  \ on her face is as horrifying as it is priceless. I soberly intervene: \n\"Ha-ha.\
  \ He means a girl bar. I want to dance with a girl.\" \nThere. I said it. \nHer\
  \ smile opens. \n\"Go up a block that way, then take a right. Girls only. There's\
  \ not a lot of dancing, but maybe you'll meet someone you like.\" \nI thank her.\
  \ Dillon hugs me goodbye, as he will be barred from the club on account of his penis\
  \ (or, more likely, his drunkenness.) \n\"I know you're going to meet some gorgeous\
  \ woman tonite, and you're going to make love, and it's going to be perfect.\" \n\
  He kisses me on the forehead. \nI never made it to the bar."
