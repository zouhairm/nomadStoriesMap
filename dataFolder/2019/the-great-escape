Text: "I exited the commuter bus after what I might call the most dangerous car ride\
  \ of my life. I wasn't 5 feet from the vehicle before I realized the how vastly\
  \ different and colorful the culture of Costa Rica was in comparison to the US.\
  \ I was a 17 year old young man studying at one of the universities and also completely\
  \ unprepared for the local culture. I was only able to communicate at first through\
  \ the use of Charlie Chapmen impersinations that  I first used to entertain children.\
  \ I found a family renting a room relativly quick. The father of the family was\
  \ very helpful but also a prankster. At first when I arrived he offered to teach\
  \ me spanish and pointed me to what he said was a spanish teacher. Later on I learned\
  \ that the woman I was learning spanish from was actually a prostatute. I'd go to\
  \ share spanish I learned from the woman and the patriarch of the family was then\
  \ smacked aggressively by both his mother and wife. The family would laugh and I\
  \ would think of my own family. For the area they lived were very wealthy and had\
  \ a very similar living standard to our own. They would have the same meals prepared\
  \ everyday by their nanny. Fresh cheese, fresh juice, hammered meat usually pork\
  \ or chicken, and plantains. I'm not certain that I was given the roll of walking\
  \ the women to school, work, and social engagements because they treated me as a\
  \ family member or if it was a socially required job of a man that lives with your\
  \ family. In the streets I could smell the motorcycles, food from the market, and\
  \ a soft touch of ocean spray. To the right of their home was a small conveniant\
  \ store. Inside this pink and orange painted stucco building was a man so vile that\
  \ the ground smoked where he walked. In this store was where I met my nemesis. It\
  \ became the shop owner's and my custom to dread eachother. In the world of bargaining\
  \ you should never try and speak the seller's or buyer's language if you are not\
  \ fluent. Our epic battle was never over anything but Cocoa Cola. Yet the drama\
  \ was not over the coke that sat in a refrigerated cooler behind him but in the\
  \ method of its delivery. Coke I would say firmly. He would grab the coke. Hesitate\
  \ to open it. The same spot things usually got hairy. He would then remove the cap\
  \ from the glass bottle and go to poor it into a plastic sack which he would then\
  \ tape a straw too for my drinking pleasure. But no more! This time the bottle would\
  \ be mine! \n\"No!\" I spoke forcefully so that there would be no mistake. A line\
  \ had been drawn in the sand. Children stood ready to take the bag with a straw\
  \ which in the past they had seen me refused to drink or pay for any longer. Sweat\
  \ dripped down his face. No one moved and neither of us blinked.\nHow much do you\
  \ want for the bottle? I asked. He didn't know what to do so he stopped and drank\
  \ it from the bottle himself. So I acted out the same hand motion. Then a light\
  \ turned on and he knew For the first time I wanted the bottle. As I learned more\
  \ spanish we became friends and would go on adventures. We even send emails back\
  \ and fourth. What i learned later is that communication is the key to all understanding.\
  \ Something I always feel endebted to Costa Rica fir teaching me."
