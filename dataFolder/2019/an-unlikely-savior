Text: "Beads of sweat trickled down my face as I trudged in the sand in the blistering\
  \ heat. My head felt light and my legs were throbbing from walking so many kilometers.\n\
  \nI didn\u2019t have my sunglasses or a hat. A sunscreen was far-fetched. A bottle\
  \ of water? I wish I had.\n\nI was loathing myself to have ventured this far.\n\n\
  It felt like I was lost in a desert but I wasn\u2019t.\n\nI was on a sandbank in\
  \ South India. \n\nAt a place called Dhanushkodi. This stretch of land extends deep\
  \ into the sea from the mainland like a torn piece of cloth fluttering away from\
  \ the rest.\n\nI parked my bike a few kilometers after Rameshwaram and walked towards\
  \ Dhanushkodi. I wanted to feel the gentle wind at the break of dawn during the\
  \ peak summer month of March. Since Dhanushkodi was on the extreme eastern point\
  \ of the Indian peninsula, I wanted to catch a glorious sunrise and return. \n\n\
  The fresh sea breeze, golden sky and the sight of fishermen casting nets into the\
  \ shimmering sea enticed me to stay longer than intended.\n\nI started walking towards\
  \ the stretch of land further away from Dhanushkodi. The fact that no other tourist\
  \ ventured in that direction was appealing, especially in India where it is hard\
  \ to avoid a curious pair of eyes.\n\nI continued towards the last point as if a\
  \ spell had been cast on me. \n\nIt felt liberating as I had the whole place for\
  \ myself. I swam in the limpid water, sang aloud and even made a sand angel. \n\n\
  After an hour of merrymaking, my throat was parched and that is when reality kicked\
  \ in.\n\nI immediately took out my phone and my heart sunk. There were no signal\
  \ bars.\n\nI quickly started walking towards Dhanushkodi. My mind couldn\u2019t\
  \ resist thinking how a fun stroll had transformed into a nightmare in the span\
  \ of a few hours.\n\nAfter a long arduous trek in the torrid heat of the afternoon,\
  \ I finally found a few shacks. The faint noise of a rumbling diesel engine of an\
  \ old rickety bus confirmed that I wasn\u2019t looking at a mirage.\n\nI made my\
  \ way to a shack under the thicket of palm trees and plopped myself on a wooden\
  \ bench. I shut my eyes and relished how my skin felt under the cool shade.\n\n\
  While I was lost in thought, a young man in a striped t-shirt of red and white,\
  \ draped in a white lungi approached me. He happened to be the owner of the shack.\
  \ He looked at me with pitiable eyes as if he knew about my untold misadventure.\n\
  \nSince we didn\u2019t speak a common language, I pointed at the bottled water and\
  \ a hanging cluster of ripe bananas. I chugged the bottle of water and gobbled a\
  \ couple of bananas. \n\nWhen I reached into my pocket, I was dejected to find only\
  \ ten rupees. I was bone-tired to walk any further, so had to take the bus to reach\
  \ my bike but the cash wouldn\u2019t suffice. He refused to accept the money and\
  \ to my utter disbelief, he even offered me some cash.\n\nI was so touched by his\
  \ compassion and generosity. At that point, I had nothing but my gratitude to offer\
  \ to this gentleman.\n\nThe driver of the grunting bus blew his whistle indicating\
  \ that it was time to depart. I profusely thanked my angel in human form, assuring\
  \ him that I would return someday to pay my dues. I quickly took his picture and\
  \ bid goodbye.\n\nI settled in one of the window seats and waved at him as the bus\
  \ departed. Looking outside the window imagining all that had transpired, I realized\
  \ that I had forgotten to ask his name.\n\nIt\u2019s been 6 years since I last went\
  \ to Dhanushkodi but I vividly remember every detail of that special day. I look\
  \ at his picture once in a while, to remind myself about all the things I should\
  \ be grateful for in my life.\n\nFor me, he is an embodiment of kindness and a valuable\
  \ lesson at the importance of being empathetic to everyone, no matter what the circumstance."
