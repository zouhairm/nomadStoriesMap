Text: "\u201CTruly Scrumptious, you're truly, truly scrumptious\u2026\u201D Jeremy\
  \ and Jemima sang this on a beach to none other than Miss Truly Scrumptious in the\
  \ film \u201CChitty Chitty Bang Bang.\u201D It was a lovely movie scene that left\
  \ an indelible mark in my memory since childhood. What particularly caught my eye\
  \ was the beautiful coastline the children played along. I often wondered where\
  \ this magical place was. Years later, with the advent of the internet, I found\
  \ my answer\u2014Cap Taillat in the South of France\u2014a lovely coastal outcropping\
  \ in the Mediterranean Sea. I endeavored to someday get there. \n\nThe opportunity\
  \ came last winter when my wife and I took a Mediterranean cruise that had a port\
  \ of call in Saint-Tropez, only six miles from the \u201CTruly Scrumptious\u201D\
  \ beach. My goal was within reach. However, it soon became clear there would be\
  \ some hurdles. The beach was a bit remote and we would have to travel by taxi through\
  \ a rural terrain of hills and woods to get there. This seemed a little daunting\
  \ considering my wife and I spoke little French. \n\nThe morning our ship arrived\
  \ in Saint-Tropez we caught the first tender ashore. It was a ghost town, the streets\
  \ were deserted and not a taxi to be found. My wife called a taxi company on her\
  \ cell phone. The gentleman who answered did not speak English and it also became\
  \ quickly apparent that nobody calls for a cab early on a Sunday morning in the\
  \ off-season of Saint-Tropez. He then put his wife on the call. After a sluggish\
  \ back-n-forth, the woman said she would send her daughter and hung up. \n\nTo our\
  \ surprise, a few minutes later a taxi pulled up and out stepped Johanna. She was\
  \ a cheerful twenty-something-year-old girl who spoke better English than I did.\
  \ We relayed where we wanted to go and why. She had never heard of \u201CChitty\
  \ Chitty Bang Bang\u201D but she knew where Cap Taillat was and off we went.\n\n\
  Soon we were traveling through beautiful countryside. Far from our ship now, it\
  \ felt liberating. Over time, paved roads became dirt ones. They twisted around\
  \ steep embankments. I began to wonder how a film crew could have ever made it to\
  \ this location with their equipment. Finally, we arrived at a sign for \u201CCap\
  \ Taillat\u201D where a wooden arm to a gate stood locked. The path ahead was closed\
  \ to automobiles, yet we were still a half-mile from the beach. Johanna suggested\
  \ I go on foot from there. She and my wife would wait for me. \n\nWe got out of\
  \ the car and walked to the gate. Johanna handed me her phone with a map of the\
  \ trail pulled up on it to use as a guide. I was warmed by the gesture. As I prepared\
  \ to duck under the gate and begin my hike, an older couple strolled by walking\
  \ their dogs. Johanna spoke with them in French. There seemed to be a discussion\
  \ about the trail. Something was wrong. Johanna turned to me and said that the couple\
  \ advised not to go down the path. There had been fires in the woods along trail\
  \ during the dry season and it had been closed off for safety. Disheartened, I agreed.\n\
  \nJohanna offered instead to take us to another shoreline spot where she played\
  \ as a child on family outings. We were game. My wife snapped a picture of me in\
  \ front of the \u201CCap Taillat\u201D sign, and then we were off again. \n\nThe\
  \ vistas on the ride were gorgeous. We chatted and laughed with Johanna along the\
  \ way.  Eventually, we arrived at a cliffside and parked.  From there, on foot,\
  \ Johanna led us to a stunning seascape where green hills met a welcoming blue sea.\
  \ It was just as captivating a view as the one in the movie, yet more authentic\
  \ knowing Johanna had played there as a child. I took in the moment.\n\nAfterwards,\
  \ Johanna dropped us back in town and we said goodbye to our new friend. The district\
  \ was awake now and the storefronts were open for business. My wife and I found\
  \ a caf\xE9 and ate lunch. It was truly scrumptious."
