Text: "8 November 2016, a date that would probably put a frown on the face of Indians.\
  \ I was in Mokokchung, Nagaland; still halfway through the journey when the Prime\
  \ minister abruptly made an announcement for the immediate implementation of the\
  \ much-criticised demonetisation scheme. As a consequence, I was stranded with only\
  \ a 500 rupee note (which was unusable). Though it seemed to be a predicament, such\
  \ turn of events would soon prove to be otherwise.\n\nTwo days ago, I was visiting\
  \ Longkhum. Ensconced atop a hill, this village provides an expansive view of cascading\
  \ hill ranges and lush green trees. That made me want to change the itinerary and\
  \ spend a night in the village. But it is what we travel for, keeping what we can\
  \ take and climb down once we reach the peak.\n\nPacked and draped in a poncho,\
  \ I descended down the hill. It rained lightly. The grey gloom of clouds passed\
  \ in an unhurried manner; alongside a casual breeze swayed the branches and leaves,\
  \ it gave a serene effect to the surrounding. Immersing such experiences with all\
  \ that nature provides, often gives me a feeling of sanctity, no matter the circumstances.\
  \ This has more or less been, the agency that has made travelling, in its entirety\
  \ a through experience.\n\nOn reaching the bus stop, I lounged myself at the empty\
  \ bench with a book in hand, a lovely collection of Naga folklore. When the sun\
  \ came out, it was noon already. There was no sign of the bus nor any other vehicle\
  \ on the road except for a couple of motorcycles. Right after I started wondering\
  \ about it, I noticed a kid on the opposite side. \n\n\u201CCan you tell me the\
  \ bus timings? I have been waiting here for a while\u201D. Amused by my reply, his\
  \ head cocked slightly. \u201CIt\u2019s Sunday. No bus.\u201D Saying it, he ran\
  \ away. Later on, I got to know the reason. The majority of the population being\
  \ Christian, go for a Sunday mass and so, take a break from the weeklong work. Well,\
  \ that was a bump, even so, it didn\u2019t seem to bother me much. I thought about\
  \ walking the distance. Mokokchung was 17 km away. And so, I started off.\n\nOptimism\
  \ can take you very far or in my case the thrill of striding along the hilly roads.\
  \ My adventure spirit had brought me far enough; a little respite was needed. I\
  \ was hoping to hitch a ride. But people aren\u2019t always keen to accommodate\
  \ a stranger along the way. With the dusk approaching, I could see the town was\
  \ nearby, with all its twinkling lights. That brought back some vigour and so I\
  \ pushed ahead. I would have reached the town sooner or later. Right then, a Maruti\
  \ Gypsy pulled up in front of me.\n\n\u201CGet in, I\u2019m heading towards the\
  \ town.\u201D an amiable look from the man in army uniform, gave me some reassurance.\
  \ Putting the bag in the back seat, I hopped in. What luck! \n\n\u201CSo where you\u2019\
  re from?\u201D he asked with a disarming smile. \u201CBhubaneshwar\u201D I replied,\
  \ \u201CPerhaps you wouldn\u2019t know, it\u2019s in Odisha.\u201D He smiled again,\
  \ and in a fluent Odiya, he asked me, \u201CBrother, which locality?\u201D"
