Text: I travelled many places in India. Most interesting is local people who actually
  told me about the place. I made my own trip and connected with locals and knowing
  more about the place. I went to Dwarika in Gujarat India and got to know many interesting
  things from local people. In Dwarika , river goutmi flow from sea side and in early
  morning we can cross the river from one side to other but as soon as sun rises river
  flows and you can not think to cross the river, when i got to know about that so
  next morning i experienced the same. That was amazing experience. I travelled to
  Dharamshala himanchal pradesh India. It was beautiful city surrounded by mountains.
  I have seen one of  the beautiful stadium in Asia. Experienced cozy drizzle rain
  and fresh air. Early morning sun rise and darkest night. Recently travelled to Pattaya
  Thailand as well. I met up with local people. They are very punctual for time and
  sweet for other people. I loved the coral beach over there.crystal Clear water and
  white sand and stone in between island. Something was very attractive and peaceful
  where you can meditate or relax yourself.
