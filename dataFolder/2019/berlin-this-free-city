Text: "The first time I came to Berlin, I had some high expectations and I have been\
  \ disappointed. I found the city not very accessible, dirty, too big... I thought\
  \ that the Germans became alcoholics on Friday nights because they were all walking\
  \ around with a bottle of beer in their hands. I thought their evenings in the squats\
  \ with lots of drugs and weird people were creepy. I was staying in Friedrichshain\
  \ near the WarschauerStr. and I found it ugly. Berlin didn't look like the pink\
  \ novels from my teenage years, nor the films about the Cold War...I didn\xB4t recognize\
  \ that place. I came back by chance 3 and a half years later, in 2014, because I\
  \ was visiting my new Berliner boyfriend. And I discovered something else! First\
  \ I was impressed to feel a certain freedom of action. In Berlin, no one will judge\
  \ you on your choices, no matter. Then a certain sweetness of life, a philosophy\
  \ of well-being and of present moment dominate. For example, when the weather is\
  \ fine, everyone goes out in the parks, money is not the most important for a Berliner\
  \ who wants to enjoy his city. A wearable barbecue and a few beers at the tempelhofer\
  \ feld for example are enough for a successful day. You can see Albanian, Greek\
  \ or Montenegro families arriving with their sofas from their living room to spend\
  \ the day in the field. At the beginning, it\xB4s very strange this sharing of the\
  \ private sphere, but then we use with it and we no longer pay attention, it seems\
  \ normal and we live together. We share public gardens that we come to rake when\
  \ we want. Berlin is great during the summer time of course. The older ones leave\
  \ early to the lakes, the younger ones a bit later. Beer gardens and evenings in\
  \ the squats proliferate and many neighbourhood festivals come to embellish the\
  \ Berliner and his taste buds. Then comes the winter, the one that we pay to have\
  \ the spring next. Winter is depressing because we live nestled in the heated apartments,\
  \ the city is grey and asphalt but if the lakes are frozen they allow winter pleasures.\
  \ The abundance of museums, theatres, concerts make it possible to pass the time\
  \ but definitely Berlin is a summer city ! The Berliner at first sight is ruf, especially\
  \ the bus drivers! But sensitive to kindness, to the efforts to speak his language,\
  \ to smiles, he will quickly relax and try a second degree of humour that only an\
  \ experienced tourist will understand and appreciate. It\xB4s a people with a warrior\xB4\
  s History who has a little trouble with the tourists. The \"Fuck tourists\" is present\
  \ somewhere on the walls of the city center...they have the habit of invading not\
  \ being invaded? Or is it the residue of the Cold War where we lived isolated on\
  \ an island? Of course the Cold War is still there...from the airport to the old\
  \ GDR buildings, the traces of History are everywhere and became tourist attractions\
  \ that delight its operators. Today we pay to go for a walk in the traban, to be\
  \ photographed with a fake soldier at checkpoint Charlie or to visit the old tunnels\
  \ of the city. It\xB4s the victory of capitalism and the strength of a people able\
  \ to rise from black centuries to become one of the most tolerant of Europe. For\
  \ the first time and only in Berlin, the 8th of March will be a day off. One of\
  \ many symbols for this city which keeps its revange on the history."
