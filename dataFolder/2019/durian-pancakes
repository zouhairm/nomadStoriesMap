Text: "My stomach ached. Air was barely escaping my lungs. Dizzily enchanted by the\
  \ floating white grin across from me - I felt similarly suspended in time. Perhaps\
  \ it was the lack of sleep or the 11 348 km away from home. I couldn\u2019t quite\
  \ explain my delusional state. All I knew was that we had been nervously laughing\
  \ since the second we leaped into the ill-lit cab and heard the first reminder of\
  \ due payment. \u201CTing\u201D. The meter went off yet again, an almost perfectly\
  \ timed cue to take a breath. Jabu\u2019s booming laughter, in sync with my own,\
  \ echoed against the confines of the tiny yellow taxi as we wound away from Pak\
  \ Tam Chung Holiday Camp. Our only sense of familiarity dwindled as we neared our\
  \ new destination. \u201CTing\u201D. God, this was going to cost a fortune.  \n\
  \   \n\u201CSai Kung\u201D. We fumbled in our wallets, briefly relieved by the surprisingly\
  \ low taxi-fare, only to remember the rude reality of the rand to Hong Kong dollar\
  \ exchange rate. Adrien, a post-graduate student from Hong Kong University, guided\
  \ us towards a charming storefront decorated with an enticing collection of vibrant\
  \ desserts; the other students scattered along the sides. Ah, brought back to our\
  \ original mission: to satisfy the sweet tooth. We naturally huddled into our distinct\
  \ South African and Hong Kong clusters and poured over the menus, riddled with choice.\
  \ The Hong Kong students were clearly energised to be free from \u2018baby-sitting\u2019\
  \ South Africans all day. It was finally time to let loose. Excited whispers amongst\
  \ the Hong Kong postgraduates became loud exclamations, insisting that everyone\
  \ try the durian pancakes - the durian fruit had been the hot topic of conversation\
  \ leading up to this late-night dessert pursuit. Motivated by curiosity and a sense\
  \ of adventure, a round of durian pancakes was now on the cards.  \n\nCantonese\
  \ and English chatter peppered with the odd Afrikaans exchange was abruptly interrupted\
  \ by a collective grimace on the face of the South Africans. The odour that now\
  \ saturated the air conjured up memories of the sweaty bodies that had travelled\
  \ together from the airport to the site of the field trip that same day. The source\
  \ of the smell was placed on the table and we were prompted to \u2018dig-in\u2019\
  . A not-so-sweet-treat. We were baffled by the local\u2019s delight at this supposed\
  \ \u2018delicacy\u2019 and turned up our noses - the divide was clear - while the\
  \ Hong Kong student\u2019s heads were down, mouths stuffed.   \n\nWith bellies that\
  \ were now full, or at least not so keen to eat anything more, we made our way along\
  \ the boardwalk by the harbour front. As if almost to continue the theme of divide,\
  \ we could feel the weight of eyes confirming our foreigner-status. Jabu and I,\
  \ a juxtaposition of a tall black man and a blonde white woman, seemed to challenge\
  \ the lack of outward diversity amongst the locals watching on. Coming from South\
  \ Africa, we have always been acutely aware of race, but here it was not a straight-forward\
  \ black and white concern, but rather a case of intrigue. As we moved from one pair\
  \ of eyes to the next, our own interest was piqued by the array of lively sea creatures\
  \ in glass displays along the seafront \u2013 begging to be stared at. The sheer\
  \ variety of fascinating fish had our eyes experience a level of sensory overload\
  \ akin to what our nostrils had been subjected to a few minutes earlier. I almost\
  \ immediately understood the fascination with something so foreign and unfamiliar.\
  \ \n\nSilhouetted by the Sai-Kung seafood market, we stood mesmerised by the glistening\
  \ water surface. The black of the night sprinkled with shimmers of white stars and\
  \ colourful lights comforted me in this unknown. My own little rainbow nation in\
  \ what was to be my new home for the next week."
