Text: "When it then president of the USA Barack Obama signaled for the possible aim\
  \ of the economical embargo in Cuba it was the empurr\xE3ozinho that needed, I was\
  \ sure what had arrived the hour of going for the only country of the world with\
  \ life habits without the influence of the global consumerism, before being invaded\
  \ by tourists.\n\nIt is the only country because the Cubans think in the quite singular\
  \ form, they can value the money and not overestimate it, value the personal relations.\
  \ Cuba has countless natural beauties and is a country that breathes culture, get\
  \ ready to find great art in the exuberant streets, rich cookery, dance and music.\
  \ Cuba is a surprises!\n\nIn March of 2015 I set free in the International Airport\
  \ Jos\xE9 Mart\xED where we had rented a car. An important hint, the airport is\
  \ quite remote of the central region of Havana and it was quite long to catch the\
  \ car since there is no technology for card and checking of reserves, but to rent\
  \ a car was a good option since we were going to turn the island and for dislocation\
  \ it is the best form.\n\nAnd because of not being such an in demand destiny it\
  \ is difficult to find informations. We rack our brains to discover how we would\
  \ do the visa, which coin to get a beating, etc. O objective of this text is to\
  \ help the one who is going with general basic hints.\n\nCoin\n\nCuba has two coins,\
  \ the weight cubado and the national coin. Theoretically the tourists cannot use\
  \ the national coin, the Cubans receive the salary in this coin and she is equal\
  \ to 1/25 of the Cuban weight. For tourist it is called the coin a CUC.\nWhen we\
  \ were, a CUC was costing approximately 1 euro. It is very important to take euros\
  \ to Cuba, since the dollar is overtaxed and you finish losing much money. In the\
  \ cities the conversion is more advantageous. In the hotels you also manage to change\
  \ money.\n\nSiege\n\nGirls, the Cubans are very indiscreet, they look in the biggest\
  \ brazen one of the world, are calling, it is flat! The Cubans also look and sometimes\
  \ they are lacking if it plays on top of the tourists. But it is their culture,\
  \ then, it is not worthwhile if it stresses. Already vain knowing and separate,\
  \ they do not stick, do not pull in do nor swim, only they disturb! They blink and\
  \ play kisses. The most heard sentences: \"beautiful lady, taxi?, Spain?, hey hey,\
  \ \u2026\u201D \n\nFood\n\nThere have many results of the sea, shrimps and lobster,\
  \ and the prices are quite accessible!\nThere they eat the creole rice, which is\
  \ a version of the folk music and dance of two, rice cooked together with bean,\
  \ I found quite tasty. Another typical plate is the ropa vieja, which consists of\
  \ a stew that in some versions takes banana. They eat very much pig meat, and I\
  \ tasted meat lamb that is very good!\n\nMain bases\n\nHavana \n\nI would separate\
  \ at least two days in Havana. It is impossible to go to Cuba and not to know his\
  \ splendorous capital! Get ready to plunge into great culture and joy! The most\
  \ legal of Havana is only to walk in the streets. The old buildings and the ancient\
  \ cars are a charm to part.\n\nVaradero\n\nIn Varadero the idea is to relax in the\
  \ sea of the Caribbean and to tan the resort. There have many options of resorts\
  \ and the prices are very competitive! \n\nCienfuegos, Trinidad, Santa Clara\n\n\
  To pass for Trinidad and Santa Clara, between other places, is worthwhile to know\
  \ the deep Cuba, it not had been in the tourist itinerary. The hint here is to be\
  \ in Hostel at the home of the Cubans, much better and accessible. \n\nThe end\n\
  \nThe great discovery was by chance, in the end of the travel an ecological reserve\
  \ near to Havana, it has no hotel, we rent a house of a Cuban.  It sunset lovelier\
  \ than I already saw and the sea of the perfect caribe that can already feel."
