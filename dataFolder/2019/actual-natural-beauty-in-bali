Text: My first experience in traveling to an island that was famous for its beauty
  and very strong cultural heritage, Bali, was one of my first experiences in knowing
  the outside world, I decided to go to Bali with my friends, we departing from where
  we use travel a public transportation tool, the distance we travel is not short,
  but our trip takes up to approximately 11 hours to arrive at the port of Banyuwangi,
  we arrive at the port to continue crossing to the island of Bali. Right at 11:00
  a.m. (western Indonesia time), we boarded a ferry to cross to the island of Bali,
  while on the boat I along with my friends headed to the top floor of the ship to
  be able to enjoy the beautiful scenery around the sea, the sea it was very calm
  and the winds that blew in seemed to make our trip relaxed and calming, the stars
  that were clearly visible in the sky, showing the peace of the inhabitants of the
  space at that time, were very pleasant !, added to the beauty of the sea at that
  time depicting diverse peace the type of living things in it, we had time to take
  pictures at that time, the gusts of the wind that were getting stronger added to
  the cold around us, made us cold and almost caught a cold, one of my friends with
  his face asked us to go back down because we couldn't stand It's cold, it's funny,
  after about sixty minutes, our ship arrived at the harbor "crazy anuk 'bali, we
  arrived at 12:25 (central Indonesia time), then we headed to the exit to get to
  our travel car, when the trip to the exit, we passed a high bridge that passed the
  ocean to go to the exit, something unique happened to at that time, it turned out
  that below us there were some adults swimming right under our bridge while shouting
  something that was not clear in our ears, then we saw people around us drop coins
  from the bridge then the people who were at the sea at that time immediately took
  it, at that time we understood that it turned out that the people who swam under
  it were waiting for the visitors who came to give away their coins by dropping it
  from the bridge to the sea and then taking it.it was unthinkable how cold they were
  long time at sea in the middle of the night like this.Then our travel was waiting
  right in front of the exit, then we went straight in and headed to the lodging in
  the closest area, when we arrived at the inn feeling very tired we decided to lay
  our bodies down first, take a break to prepare for the next destination.The next
  day we were getting ready to go to the first location we planned, yes, Bali's Pandawa
  Beach, one of our initial destinations in Bali, this morning was the right time
  for us to go to the beach because on the sun when it contains a lot of benefits
  and vitamins and is also very suitable for healthy skin, tourists in this location
  not only come from Indonesians even from many countries, tourists from various regions
  also enjoy the natural beauty that is in Indonesia is especially on the island of
  Bali, some of them take advantage of this moment to sunbathe themselves, take pictures,
  but also some children take advantage of this moment to play sand or swim on the
  coast and various activities that excite others, we also do not want to lose , we
  tried several rides namely Banana Boat, Seawalker, Rafting, Flyboard, Submarine
  Tourism, and various rides Another great thing, when we tried submarine tours, we
  saw the amazing underwater scenery, variety and variety of ornamental fish that
  are very unique and very diverse, from small to large, very extraordinary, we were
  very impressed with Indonesia's extraordinary natural wealth. in the afternoon we
  decided to attend a dance performance typical of Bali,when thedance,performance
  was finished,the visitors,were allowed,to take pictures, with dance players, it
  was a very impressive,experience that we could not forget,for the rest of our lives.
