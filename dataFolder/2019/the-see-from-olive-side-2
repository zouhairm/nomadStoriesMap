Text: "The beautifull green sea of Europe\nThere is a sea, complete green, and never\
  \ ending, that changes Month by Month, new animals come and go, some of them stay\
  \ forever... That sea is open mind, its open for whatever nationality and people\
  \ around the world.\n\nInside this sea, there is a dragon, who sleep forever. \n\
  \nIf you don't know the name is this sea, i will tell you... It is Ja\xE9n, i came\
  \ for a scholarship to study a master degree in Ja\xE9n and for sure it\xB4s a sea\
  \ of Olive's trees. One of the best olives oils around the world, can be found in\
  \ Ja\xE9n. I met people of many different cultures and nationalities, i could travel\
  \ around many countries in Europe and i realice of the rich culture that is in Ja\xE9\
  n. I could met the dragon of Ja\xE9n, and where he live, an also i met the refuge\
  \ where people stayed during civil war, and for sure the castle of Santa Catalina\
  \ who can be seen from all Ja\xE9n Capital. I made friends many of them stay in\
  \ my heart and we talk frequently, the streets of Ja\xE9n are the best place to\
  \ find with your self and fall in love at the same time with the city, you can go\
  \ dancing or get with your friends in a Bar, or also sing in Karaoke, but the best\
  \ feeling is wake up and see the sea green that hug your wake up... I visited one\
  \ almazara and i tasted the diferents types of olive oils, fragrances, colors, and\
  \ flavors... It was fantastic!!!\n\nIf i can reborn again i will do the same, to\
  \ stay again in one erasmus in Ja\xE9n..."
