Text: "It is around midday that I start to worry that Podgorica may not actually exist.\
  \ Nothing is quite where the map claims it should be in the Montenegrin capital.\
  \ Initially I put the missing monuments down to my rather out of date map, until\
  \ a Roman bridge disappears as well.\n\nThe centre of town is also curiously deserted\
  \ on this particular Monday, and there seem to be no other visitors staying at the\
  \ hostel. Even Milo\u0161 the owner (who ultimately proves to be a truly excellent\
  \ host) had failed to materialise until I'd woken the neighbouring dogs.\n\nAt his\
  \ advice, I make for the sports centre in the hope of obtaining tickets for that\
  \ evening's football match with local rivals Partisan Belgrade. Aside from two teenagers\
  \ ostentatiously counting a wad of notes on the steps outside, however, the place\
  \ is utterly deserted. The adjacent American embassy, meanwhile, could be a mausoleum\
  \ for all the activity it betrays.\n\nThe city is long and low, nestled under the\
  \ mountains that cover the vast majority of Montenegro. There are no real monuments\
  \ to orient yourself, other than the forever distant and unexplained Dajbabska Gora\
  \ radio tower. This, coupled with the heat, creates the impression that you're never\
  \ really making progress along the city's wide thoroughfares.\n\nWhen I eventually\
  \ find my way back to the hostel, several Australian girls materialise, and we venture\
  \ downtown for dinner. Downtown is a set of three or four streets just South of\
  \ the stadium, and it is here that the city's nightlife unfolds. Amongst the establishments\
  \ on offer are the Berlin, which seems to qualify for its name chiefly by selling\
  \ beer, and the Cheers pub, which qualifies for its name by refusing to sell the\
  \ one beer actually made in Montenegro.\n\nThe crown jewel of the city's bars, though,\
  \ is the Nag's Head \u2013 an entire pub themed around the British sitcom Only Fools\
  \ and Horses. The decor is surprisingly classy, if you can look past the wall-height\
  \ photos of David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst, and a larger crowd than I've seen\
  \ all day appears to be drinking there. Stay for more than a couple of beers, however,\
  \ and you may start to wonder if you\u2019re not in some Netflix-induced nightmare.\n\
  \nWe stop by a tobacconist's in search of what Milo\u0161 affectionately calls \u201C\
  government wine\u201D. Much more drinkable than the name suggests, these bottles\
  \ are produced by the local state-owned vineyard and account for 95% of the country's\
  \ wines. At the counter, I meet a man with a Buducnost football shirt and a pitbull\
  \ terrier. I delicately ask if he's going to the match.\n\n\u201CYes my friend!\u201D\
  \ he roars. \u201CI am barbarian, I am ultra. Do you support team?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Arsenal,\u201D I confess.\n\n\u201CIs no good,\u201D he says, shaking his head.\
  \ \u201CI am Millwall fan. They are original ultras.\u201D He looks sternly at me\
  \ before grinning and running off into the night.\n\nUpon our return, we find our\
  \ hostel newly encircled by riot police in preparation for the game. Barriers have\
  \ closed off the area, and we are forced to take a detour through what seem to be\
  \ the back gardens of an entire neighbourhood, complete with distinctly unimpressed\
  \ guard dogs. An old lady scuttles past with a lit flare. A surreal and generally\
  \ good-natured riot is underway by the stadium.\n\n\u201CMost of the Belgrade fans\
  \ are actually from Podgorica, so it will basically be Montenegrins fighting each\
  \ other,\u201D says Milo\u0161 as we scramble over the fence. \u201CYou can still\
  \ buy ticket, but only for seats just below Ultras\u2019 stand.\u201D\n\nExchanging\
  \ glances, we politely decline and open the government wine."
