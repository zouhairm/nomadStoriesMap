Text: "My name is Daniele and I'm from Brasil. I received an invitation to work in\
  \ Barcelona or Barceloca. I didn't know the city or someone here. It's a new country,\
  \  new people, new work, new life. My first day here was walking around 12 hours\
  \ in the streets, seeing how this city works, trying to create connections, know\
  \ people, trying the flavors and seeing how amazing will be live here. I rent a\
  \ bike also and went to the beach, where is one of the symbols of Barcelona,  the\
  \ W hotel, I can't believe I was there. The next points were Arc the Triunf, Ramblas,\
  \ el Gotic. Everything fascinates me, the architecture and the straight streets.\
  \ \nMy first day and I fall in love with this city. \nI stopped to eat something\
  \ in a amazing bar and restaurant named Barba Rosa, and start to talk with the owner\
  \ and the girl that was working, they were receptive and my first friends, I stayed\
  \ in this place much more time because of them and when I'd like to eat the best\
  \ burger of the city I go there. To come back to the hotel, I took the metro and\
  \ stop in the wrong station. It was a long time after midnight waiting the metro\
  \ to go to the right direction, only me in the station and I felt safe. When I arrived\
  \ at the hotel the sensation was so incredible,  I slept planning the next day,\
  \ next places and next people to meet."
