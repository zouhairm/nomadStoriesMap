Text: "It was summer. 2013 August in India, the bursting heat in Delhi. I decided\
  \ to make trip to Badrinath in quest for peace.\n\n 50 Rupaya, a non hindi language\
  \ i heard from somewhere. I peeped into window and saw a japanese girl quarreling\
  \ with Rikshawala who demanded 100. I got down bus and made shout on Rikshawala\
  \ who wanted to cheat the girl by doubling fare. She found a trust in me and seated\
  \ beside me.  The bus started, a voice i heard from back seat, 'Bhai saab (Brother)\
  \ is she your friend.' I turned back and saw a youth of my age in hindu monk garb\
  \ approached.\n\n 'No' saying him I narrated the incident. He said, 'Foreigners\
  \ are heavenly guest you did a good job, kept our nations repute aloft.'\n\nSince\
  \ my childhood i am curious of monks, I asked, 'Where he going!' \nHe said, 'I live\
  \ in Badrinath, in a Top Cave, alone.'\n\nMy curiosity increased. At the same time\
  \ Japanese girl, Mayo said, 'I am also traveling Badrinath, Please help me all the\
  \ way and there.'\n\nI said, 'Definitely! However it is my first tour!'\n\nThe young\
  \ monk interfered, 'Brother and Sister, if you don't mind I will tour you and accommodate\
  \ you in good lodge. Because people there cheat new visitors.'\n\n'Thank you swamyji\
  \ (Monk called in Hindi)' I said.\n\nAs the bus journey 16 hours there were 3 stops\
  \ every 4 hours and was stop Badrinath as 4th Stop. \n\nThe Bus made a first stop\
  \ at Haridwar junction. We got down, I sponsored indian Lassi (Sweet Curd Drink\n\
  ) and snacks to Monk and Japanese girl. I had already built a beautiful relation\
  \ with them. Out of my curosity I asked the monk why he became monk at young age.\
  \ \n\nHe said, 'I completed my Mphil in Botany from University of Delhi. I had quest\
  \ for God then I met with a enlightened Baba in Delhi in a programme, and frequently\
  \ visited him with different questions. I realized the life is waste without quest\
  \ for God, the materialistic life is bogus. I immersed all my diploma certificates\
  \ in holy ganga and became disciple of the Baba. He passed away two years ago, since\
  \ then I have been shifted to Badrinath, living in cave and keeping busy in reading\
  \ and writing.'\n\n He asked me why I was visiting Badrinath. I said that I failed\
  \ in Civil Service  Examination  in last chance so out of frustration i am traveling\
  \ in quest for peace. \n\nHe laughed and said, 'Failures only enlighten people!'\n\
  \nThe Bus Journey resumed. We decided a small nap for 4 hours, till next stop. Next\
  \ stop was Haldwani town. we reached in After noon. The japanese girl wanted to\
  \ sponsor us lunch but I denied as she was our guest and i also never wanted to\
  \ take anything from Monk. I sponsored both the lunch.\n\n Anyhow we reached Badrinath\
  \ at night. I had a curious to learn about why Mayo visiting Badrinath from Japan.\
  \ The young monk arranged a lodge for her and I decided to stay with him at Cave.\
  \ The beautiful cold morning approached. Mayo was wandering with a photo. The young\
  \ monk saw the photo and said, 'O God!' he showed same picture in his mobile phone.\n\
  \nJapanese girl said, 'Do you know him!'\n'yes' he stayed with me in Cave.\n\n'Where\
  \ is he! I am his wife! I am here in search of my Husband!\n\n'Come in the Cave!'\
  \ said monk, we all went his cave. He opened his trunk box and gave some things\
  \ to the girl and in tears said, 'I couldn't save your husband, he washed away in\
  \ the flood June-16 while i was out and he was taking photographs.'  it was very\
  \ sad day 5700 people day.\n\nShe broke down, fell on ground with tears. I too couldn't\
  \ control my tears to release. Suddenly all my quest for peace turned in deep turn.\
  \ I consoled the japanese girl, then one more day I spent with them. We had several\
  \ discussion on life, peace and God.\n\nThis journey made me realize the peace is\
  \ every where if we connect to people heart to heart. It changed my life."
