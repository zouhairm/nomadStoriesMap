Text: "Since that Bali trip in 2014, I\u2019ve caught the travel bug and been in and\
  \ out of Singapore seven times each year for the next two years.\n\nThe two craziest\
  \ years of my life - striking off item after item on my bucket list, meeting people\
  \ from all over the world and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, trip after\
  \ trip.\n\nI\u2019ve jumped out of a plane in Brazil, dived in the beautiful oceans\
  \ of Malaysia, ran off a cliff in Vietnam, scaled the highest volcano in Indonesia,\
  \ took a helicopter ride above the majestic Angkor Wat temples in Cambodia and couchsurfed\
  \ in Australia. \n\nI\u2019ve travelled solo in multiple cities, travelled as an\
  \ uncle with my adorable nephews, travelled for the first time with my father in\
  \ 25 years, travelled with lovers, travelled with friends old and new, and even\
  \ travelled for free, with a 5-star hotel stay.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten lost, gotten\
  \ robbed, gotten sick. Been drunk on the streets. Starved till I couldn\u2019t speak.\
  \ I\u2019ve cried and smiled, loved and lost. And yet I yearn for it more: The feeling\
  \ of plunging into the unknown. The freedom that comes with exploration and living\
  \ each day to the fullest. The feeling of waking up every single day excited.\n\n\
  The planet is such a \uFEFF\uFEFFbeautiful \uFEFF\uFEFFplace and I believe we are\
  \ all placed here to discover it.\uFEFF\uFEFF \uFEFF\uFEFFTo discover the beauty\
  \ of nature and the beauty of different cultures."
