Text: "Let\u2019s imagine: bright moon in the clear sky, starry night and the empty\
  \ field with no one around. It\u2019s the first scene they show us in the films\
  \ about trips of a brave person to the universe. Each such character is a real hero\
  \ at the end, the one who conquered the moon, the galaxy or the whole universe.\
  \ \n\nMy universe usually ends on the hight of about 12 km (it\u2019s not higher\
  \ than a distance to the flight in the sky), but I still have something to conquer\
  \ and something to dream about. Of course the world has it\u2019s limits, but despite\
  \ this fact there is nobody who had been to it\u2019s every region or city. No one\
  \ could ever do it and would never be able to bring this idea to life.  Let\u2019\
  s not forget about of body and time limits. All these shouldn\u2019t stop anyone\
  \ from traveling, quite the contrary, understanding this people should make different\
  \ accents. By \u201Cdifferent accents\u201D I mean that the main goal have to be\
  \ changed from visiting each and every county of the planet only to strike it off\
  \ the list, into taking a great journey to some of it, instead.  During travels\
  \ like those I just mentioned feel the life there, taste traditional food of the\
  \ country, meet people and try to understand their culture. That where the true\
  \ pleasure from trips is. \n\nAs a traveler, I prefer spending more time to \u201C\
  feel\u201D the country. The best example to illustrate my idea may be my one-month-long\
  \ trip to Paris, the city that I have visited plenty of times before, but which\
  \ was a mystery (or some kind of a secret) for me. Only after this long stay there,\
  \ I started understanding mentality, culture, traditions and habits of local people\
  \ and city in general. \n\nOf course, you might think that it\u2019s one of the\
  \ most popular place among tourists of all the world, and that it has lost its value\
  \ because of them, but it\u2019s  not true. Even after this kind of impact, this\
  \ city still has it\u2019s own charm. Through it\u2019s long history, Paris got\
  \ a lot of changes, and locals weren\u2019t pleased about it. \nOf course changes\
  \ are mostly stressful, yet they are exciting when accept them. Stress is a part\
  \ of people\u2019s nature (it\u2019s strange but it\u2019s true, like the song says),\
  \ and even though we don\u2019t want any stress to be in our life, living would\
  \ be boring without it. So, it\u2019s clear why Parisians still has a lot of complaints,\
  \ but, today it\u2019s less common for them. \n\nLife gives us a choice\u2014 to\
  \ live regular, simple and easy life, or to take a leap into unknown. Each of us\
  \ make this type of a decision in everyday life: to go to a new place with a friend\
  \ or to stay at home; to start learning new language or to rely on charisma and\
  \ use \u201Cinternational gestures\u201D to explain people who don\u2019t speak\
  \ our language what we need, to visit new country or to choose one you have already\
  \ been to before. There are much more examples like those and all of them have something\
  \ in common\u2014 risk of some kind. And every single example still has some unpredictable\
  \ consequences in it.\n\nThe same is with journeys \u2014 you won\u2019t know what\
  \ will happen unless you try it. Trips may be hard in preparation, but good efforts\
  \ bring better results.\n In my life I visited a lot of countries and each trip\
  \ had something unpredictable and unknown in it. \n\nEvery journey is an \u201C\
  unknown\u201D but not every person can \u201Ctake a leap\u201D into it."
