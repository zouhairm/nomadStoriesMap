Text: "I knew there were jellyfish somewhere in the water, so translucent we couldn\u2019\
  t anticipate their sting. Rocks jutted out from the cliff face below me; I wasn\u2019\
  t sure my hike-weak legs could even make a jump far enough to clear them. The blue\
  \ entry point I was aiming for seemed farther from my abandoned clothes than when\
  \ I had shed them on the pebble shore. I had a choice: either wind my way through\
  \ the remains of Hera\u2019s temple, head hung and toes sherd-scratched, or I could\
  \ jump.\n\nI had started my day with a shrill pre-dawn alarm, left my apartment\
  \ in Pangrati as quietly as possible, trying not to disturb my hungover roommates,\
  \ and crossed the National Garden to Syntagma Square. There, I boarded a bus full\
  \ of strangers, all decked out with intimidating-as-hell hiking gear and speaking\
  \ to each other in rapid Greek. They must have noticed the terror in my eyes because,\
  \ with true Greek hospitality, they switched to English and began asking me how\
  \ I had heard of the Athens Hiking Club. My social anxiety eased for the moment\
  \ and we set off for the hour and a half drive to Geraneia. Through the scooters\
  \ and motorcycles of Athens, past the arid highway lands, and finally into the forest.\
  \  Spindly Greek pine whizzed by on my left; the Gulf of Corinth sparkled on my\
  \ right.\n\nThe incline of our hike was gentle, so we talked as we rambled up the\
  \ grey rock. One companion told me he had joined the hiking club to spend more time\
  \ in nature. The concrete apartments of Athens, which had been built over the neoclassical\
  \ mansions to accommodate the influx of people moving from the countryside to the\
  \ city to find work in the 1960s, dominated the city\u2019s architecture, and for\
  \ him, hiking in Geraneia today allowed the chance to see some greenscapes and spend\
  \ a day away from the cigarette, coffee, and wine diet of Athenian youth.  A long\
  \ journey down, slipping on grey shale and pine needles alternately, and we ended\
  \ at a natural spring, water sparkling cold and supposedly with the power to bring\
  \ you everlasting love. I gulped it down.\n\nA quick debate about the merits of\
  \ another hour and a half drive and we were on our way to the Heraion of Perachora,\
  \ the archaeological site preserving and displaying the remains of the West Court\
  \ of Hera\u2019s temple in Loutraki. Our bus dropped us off at the edge of an isolated\
  \ cliff. The air was still and a hush fell over the group as we found a path down\
  \ the rocky embankment. We paused for respite from the afternoon sun at a small\
  \ shelter and refilled the water bowls of some local cats. One step more and there\
  \ it was: a brilliant topaz cove, sheltered on three sides by the buff incline we\
  \ had just descended. Column bases, broken off no more than a foot high, littered\
  \ the pebble shore below, corralled by a low, rectangular foundation. Two thousand\
  \ years ago, the citizens of Loutraki made their way to this protected sanctuary\
  \ to offer gifts on Hera\u2019s hearth in exchange for her blessing on their homes,\
  \ marriages, and pregnancies. Today, we visitors from Athens, instead stripped hiking\
  \ clothes from sweaty limbs and laid them on the pebbles that became her altar.\
  \ We dipped our toes in, turning the topaz murky periwinkle. Our guide caught our\
  \ attention, waved us over to follow him, and began winding up the opposite face.\
  \ The reverent hush of before changed to excited whispers and giggles when we made\
  \ it to the edge overlooking the deepest part of the cove. One by one, my hiking\
  \ companions leapt into the blue, their jubilant splashes and happy screeches breaking\
  \ the quietness of our surroundings. I watched them jump, nervously chewing my lip.\
  \ I hadn\u2019t left my home over 5,000 miles away to return the same as I had always\
  \ been; I hadn\u2019t traveled forward over 2,000 years in time just to leave this\
  \ holy place unchanged.\n\nI jumped."
