Text: "My favourite place where i love to travel is ajmer sharif. It is the best place\
  \ to get relief and happiness. Thoughts that are running inside one's mind gets\
  \ clear. It is one of the best place to travel. Dargah Sharif\_Ajmer\nIt is believed\
  \ that a person who prays with a pure heart at the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, gets all\
  \ his or her wishes fulfilled. Ajmer Sharif is a Sufi shrine and one of the most\
  \ visited places in Ajmer. The pious Persian Sufi saint, Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti\
  \ who is well-known for its secular preaching is enshrined here. Many Muslims believe\
  \ that Moinuddin Chisti was Muhammad\u2019s direct descendant and it was on his\
  \ request (Muhammad came to his dream) he went to India. He reached Ajmer in 1192\
  \ via Lahore and stayed there till his death in 1236 AD.\nHis shrine was built by\
  \ Mughal Emperor Humayun, and in order to enter the dargah, you need to go through\
  \ a series of massive doors made from silver with beautiful carvings. As you reach\
  \ the courtyard, you would come across the tomb of Moinuddin Chishti, carved out\
  \ of marble. It has gold plating on top and is guarded by a railing made from silver\
  \ and a marble screen.\nThat cold breeze gives relief of relaxation. \nIt is one\
  \ of the best place for shopping. Colourful rajasthani dresses, toys for children,colourful\
  \ dupattas. Full of lights and colours. Best places to visit are tara gad, ana sagar,\
  \ pushkar lake, adhai din ka jhopra. Best time to visit dargah is during urus festival.\
  \ \nThis place serves good food both veg and non veg. There good hotels to stay.\
  \ Transportation is good. Station is near. \nIn short it is the best place to visit\
  \ during vacation."
