Text: "My recent 5-day visit to the city of Tashkent in Uzbekistan was my 2nd international\
  \ trip. The moment I reached the airport terminal time there, & I felt the distinct\
  \ cultural shift. I love the city, the moment I got into the bus I was welcomed\
  \ by the wide open, clean roads,  Streets were lined up with impressive old style\
  \ vintage buildings, & their facades were all displaying fancy laser projections\
  \ & the entire city was gleaming. \n\nAs I kept strolling around the roads in the\
  \ evening, I got interacted with a lot of locals, the moment they saw me, they recognized\
  \ my ethnicity & greeted me with my own nations greeting words \u201DNamaste, Namashkar\u201D\
  .  Some of them know songs of our Hindi Bollywood movies & I was really amazed &\
  \ impressed by that sheer gesture & felt like home. Every single person I met from\
  \ street hawker to the manager was so humble & extra polite when they came to know\
  \ that I am from India. \nI remember I was going for a walk in the evening & I met\
  \ a college student & I asked him to click one picture of mine & after clicking,\
  \ he asked me about my country & he told me that his college professors are from\
  \ India as well. He asked me to accompany me while waking because he was also going\
  \ in the same direction, Since language is a big issue in Uzbekistan because no\
  \ one has a comm& over English compared to most of the western countries but still\
  \ it was fascinating to talk to them, in less world, the more you are able to converse.\
  \ While walking he sang the title song from one of our movie \u201CKabhi Khushi\
  \ Kabhi Gham\u201D & he asked me to explain the meaning of this title & I told him,\
  \ it means \u201Csometimes happy, sometimes sad\u201D & he said in the Uzbek language\
  \ also Gham is pronounced as Gham only. \nLikewise one night I went to caf\xE9 for\
  \ a dinner, I got the menu & I asked him how do I order & he said, \u201Cdon\u2019\
  t worry, look at the picture, decide, let me know & I will get it for you\u201D\
  \ & even I have any further doubt, he used to type replies in Russian, translate\
  \ in Google translator & show it to me on this mobile screen, I asked him for his\
  \ number & he saved it on my phone & along with his name, he wrote waiter & I felt\
  \ bad & I said, don\u2019t write I will remember you by your name only. we became\
  \ really good friends.\n\n\nOne day I got up early at 5:00 am, I thought of exploring\
  \ the morning scene of the city on foot & I went for a walk. While walking I saw\
  \ a small, sophisticated caf\xE9 called \u201CDiva\u201D on the junction & I went\
  \ inside & I asked for a coffee, while I was waiting, a smart, tall gentlemen came\
  \ behind me & greeted me \u201Chello\u201D & asked me from Pakistan. I said \u201C\
  no, I am from India\u201D & as usual, he got super excited & asked me to sit & he\
  \ was like \u201Cmy English, not so good, little English, my daughter, good English.\
  \ We sat for 45 minutes & talked in whatever best way we can about India, the movie\
  \ industry, he knows a lot of our actors & he showed me his family pictures & told\
  \ me that he is from Samarkand & invited me to visit him. He shared his contact\
  \ & is still in touch with me, \nOn the final day,  at a restaurant, I asked the\
  \ waiter, do you have wifi, he said\u201D no sir! Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have\
  \ but u can use my phone\u2019s hotspot\u201D. I was like no issues, thanks, & he\
  \ was like no, no I have enough data for the time, it will get wasted so please\
  \ use it. He was being so generous & kind, such small gestures of humanity have\
  \ left a very strong impression on my mind & made me fall in love with the people\
  \ of this country & taught me about the little nuances of life.\nIt\u2019s been\
  \ more than a month but still, I kept lingering on to these experiences & would\
  \ like to share with the world & encourage everyone to learn & make this world more\
  \ compassionate & beautiful."
