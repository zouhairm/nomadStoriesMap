Text: "17th February 2019\n\nI started to travel on my own for one year. Curious of\
  \ the World and of rediscovering myself, in every corner of the city I visited,\
  \ I determined to do a journey a month. \nParis, Which best destination for the\
  \ month of February! But It isn\u2019t the main reason for my choice to discover\
  \ this polite city. My desire to visit It derives from my biggest passion, Art,\
  \ and after I watched Woody Allen\u2019 film \u2018Midnight in Paris\u2019, I have\
  \ concretized my desire.\nSo, Here I am to Montmartre, at the end of this travel,\
  \ relaxed in front of a steaming fondue and a good glass of white wine strictly\
  \ of the house, to write these lines. Sincerely, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m\
  \ doing It, I\u2019m only feeling the need of throw black on white my million different\
  \ ways I\u2019m feeling now, almost I\u2019m afraid to forget It and stop It in\
  \ my present time.\nBut maybe is better if I start from the beginning.\nI left Thursday\
  \ night by FlixBus from Londra, the city I\u2019m living, conscious of the timeless\
  \ and in particular how I would have slept, if I could do It. While I was saying\
  \ goodbye to my friends, in my mind I kept telling myself the phrases who take me\
  \ for crazy to do a similar thing. But for me, excited at the thought of this travel,\
  \ fortunately never this time I\u2019ve heard them.\nWe arrived the morning after\
  \ and, after I left my back on the seat of the bus, I went to the Hostel I booked\
  \ for these days. Paris greeted me with a delicious smell of butter mixed with the\
  \ flavour of the tobacco pipe of the people who were going to live their quotidian,\
  \ and the sunny light I usually don\u2019t see in London caused me a pleasant feeling\
  \ of summer on my skin. Is like when you come back home after a long time, and your\
  \ mother opens the door for a big hug with her best smile. This way Paris welcomed\
  \ me.\nMy exploration started.\nI went around Paris trying to be secure for seems\
  \ an authentic Parisian, not before bought the classical black beret obviously,\
  \ in a confusion of wonder and surprise for every small thing was in front of me,\
  \ as a child who moves her first steps for the discovery of the World. Useless tell\
  \ you what I saw because I\u2019d sooner to tell you what I didn\u2019t live. Museums,\
  \ streets, faces, expression and city corners, the passion for Art in my heart and\
  \ the wish to take a time machine and be in a bar of Montmartre with Picasso, Gertrude\
  \ Stein and Hemingway in my fantasy mind.\nI can only ensure I walked a lot, coming\
  \ at the night full of tiredness but with the necessary forces to drink a well deserved\
  \ beer with a group of guys I met in the hostel, uniting talks and personal stories,\
  \ discovering I\u2019m not alone in some chooses and feeling included and including,\
  \ reviewing in their eyes my desire to live and to face with enthusiasm this existence\
  \ sometimes hard but always so fascinated.\nI didn\u2019t expect to find myself\
  \ in a foreign city I never see before.\nI don\u2019t consider this weekend a simple\
  \ break from the usual monotony, but a big change in a short time, throwing me in\
  \ a new experience, making new life giving me new stimuli. With this travel I have\
  \ the sure the important thing is not to stop, taking the smallest but at the same\
  \ time the more exciting opportunities that every day can offer to me, whether they\
  \ small daily moments, weekend around the World, or big changes that the life invites\
  \ you to face. Because everything can be an adventure, mine."
