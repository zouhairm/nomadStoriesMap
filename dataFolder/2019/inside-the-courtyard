Text: "The door of Morocco was waiting for me to look inside. I\u2019ve been curious\
  \ for years.\n\nAnd so I was there in Marrakesh.\nLost in the souk, I met a woman\
  \ who spoke of saffron, spices and a shop in Talioune. Yes, that was the direction\
  \ I was going.\n\nSome days later I traveled by taxi to Talioune and met a young\
  \ man Mohammed, (which seems to be the most common name - go figure) who helped\
  \ me with my luggage and took me to the best hotel in town owned by Mahfoud.\n\n\
  Mafoud was an attentive kindhearted man so I showed him my photos, and asked, \u201C\
  Where\u2019s a good place to photograph the sunset? \u201D\nHe said, \u201CI\u2019\
  ll take you there.\u201D\n\nLater that afternoon we drove past a dilapidated Kasbah\
  \ and the remains of a granary. On a barren hillside was a high stone walled structure.\
  \ \u201CWhat\u2019s that,?\u201D I asked. He said, \u201Ca Jewish cemetery.\u201D\
  \ \n\nBen was in my thoughts. He died suddenly two weeks ago. A chill went through\
  \ me as I wrapped the jelaba closer to my heart.\n\nThe road snaked upward and opened\
  \ up to a bleak and harsh landscape. We turned onto a small dirt road almost at\
  \ the crest of the Mid Atlas Mountains. Twenty kilometers later we parked and moved\
  \ by foot.\n\nOn the dusty path we passed a huge bundle of wheat on legs. Underneath\
  \ was the barely discernible shape of a woman. \n\nA Berber settlement appeared\
  \ around a bend. Stony-faced women peeked out of doorways as we walked through the\
  \ village. When they saw a camera around my neck they went inside. Two dark haired\
  \ youths started following us. \n\nAt the village\u2019s edge a pathway led to ruins\
  \ atop a hill. This was our final destination. We hiked up the trail. An eeriness\
  \ lurked around that place. We took some photos and returned through the hamlet.\n\
  \nMahfoud headed to the car. I lingered behind. A door closed as I ambled by. I\
  \ heard a scurry of footsteps behind me. My heart was pounding. The boys overtook\
  \ me and pushed the door open. They smiled and invited me to look inside. \n\nThree\
  \ children played near a row of red ranunculus. Orange and lemon trees blossomed.\
  \ Mint and lemon verbena flourished. Scented geraniums perfumed the air. The entire\
  \ courtyard was filled with golden light.\n\nMahfoud called out,\u201D it\u2019\
  s time to go back.\u201D I took one last look and started towards him.\n\nWhile\
  \ Mahfoud and I drove down the mountain he asked, \u201DWhy did you come to Morocco.\u201D\
  \ I responded, \u201CTo see inside the courtyard.\u201D"
