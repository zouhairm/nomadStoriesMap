Text: "Paris isn\u2019t a city of love; Paris is a city of beauty. And if you see\
  \ the Eiffel tower getting lit up, you would want to live in that moment forever.\n\
  I had been living in Antwerp for close to 10 months when I finally decided to take\
  \ my first trip to Paris. From the minute I set foot in Europe, all I imagined was\
  \ experiencing what the movies showed us, what everyone talked about and what being\
  \ in the city of love felt like. Two days to my trip, I arranged my clothes perfectly,\
  \ because I needed the right outfits for the best pictures. I was only going to\
  \ spend three days in the city of love, and yet my planned activities could have\
  \ taken a lifetime.\nI boarded a FlixBus at around 13:30hrs and started the journey.\
  \ It was a long seven hour bus ride, it was strenuous, it was uncomfortable, but\
  \ it was worth it. An old friend of mine was waiting for me at the bus stop when\
  \ I arrived. We took a quick taxi to the hotel, checked in and went out to have\
  \ dinner at a petite restaurant where we made our first French friend; a friend\
  \ who decided to take us to a club so we could experience the French night life.\
  \ And so my trip to Paris began.  \n\nI took out my floral pants, matched them with\
  \ a yellow crop top and a pair of silver snickers and set out to tour Paris the\
  \ next morning. I took a train \u2013 or two and found my way to the Eiffel tower.\
  \ It was flooded with tourists; we looked like ants in a file trying to catch the\
  \ sugar cubes that had fallen off the table. \u201CWow,\u201D was all I could mouth,\
  \ I was finally in the place that everyone wishes to be. I quickly asked the couple\
  \ next to me if they could take my picture and the beautiful lady accepted, probably\
  \ because of the simple rule of being a tourist; \u201Cif you take my picture, I\u2019\
  ll return the favor.\u201D As expected, I took over 100 pictures at this place.\
  \ Each step I took closer, the tower looked more beautiful.  At 50 meters to the\
  \ tower, the number of tourists intensified. I can barely remember what the hawkers\
  \ who approached me were selling because the only thing I was buying at that time\
  \ was the beauty of this creation. The creation that attracted over 1000 people\
  \ in a day.\n I found my way to a stall that sold sandwiches, got myself a chicken\
  \ sandwich and sat at one of the benches in the park to enjoy it. I kept staring\
  \ at the passersby, the ones that visited with their children, and thought to myself\
  \ how lucky these kids were. I smiled when I asked another tourist for the directions\
  \ to the love-lock bridge to which he smiled in response as he pointed in the direction\
  \ that I should take. The love-lock bridge was filled with names handwritten on\
  \ and padlocks attached by people who believed that if they locked their love with\
  \ a padlock at that bridge, and threw the key in the water below, they would be\
  \ together forever. A bridge that others believed locked their secrets away and\
  \ a bridge whose many padlocks had been taken away because the weight was too much\
  \ for it to bear. I wonder if the removal of the padlocks affected the lovers. \n\
  I thought I had exhausted the beauty of Paris when I found myself at Le Louvre Museum\
  \ the next day. When I imagined Paris, all I saw was the Eiffel tower, but the beauty\
  \ of this pyramid was exceptional. There was something magnificent that the sunlight\
  \ did to the pyramid as it shone upon it, it looked like a reflection of heaven.\
  \ It was so beautiful that I took more pictures of the pyramid than those of myself.\
  \ Within the museum, I looked at all the images that made my history classes come\
  \ to life. \nI ended my trip with a long walk to Cathedral Notre-Dame of Paris,\
  \ a cathedral of unique structure and of course a purchase of souvenirs to take\
  \ home."
