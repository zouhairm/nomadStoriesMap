Text: "I didn't know what was coming. All I know was that I hit rock bottom: got laid\
  \ off from my work in Malaysia and was left penniless. \nAfter a seemingly endless\
  \ battle between my fears and my faith, I decided to fly to one of the most diverse\
  \ spots in Asia: Bali.\n\nThe plan was simple- travel to Bali and secure a job.\
  \ \n\nAfter a  3 -hour flight, I arrived -Indonesian immigration officers looking\
  \ fierce, airport staff in their colorful batik clothes and the smell of incense\
  \ enveloping the airport hallways- this is finally it, Selamat Datang ke Bali, Indonesia!\
  \ But then, the immigration control officer was prying hard on why I came back after\
  \ being there for 5 days the previous month. Thank heavens I came up with a solid\
  \ reason why I \"came back for another holiday!\" The Philippines, after all,  is\
  \ notorious for having undocumented workers in the world. \n\nTo say that I was\
  \ on an emotional roller coaster once I passed the immigration control is an understatement.\
  \ I made it! A place where literally everyone sounds like they are talking to the\
  \ neighborhood 5 kilometers away  ALL THE TIME  had never looked so inviting. The\
  \ moment I left the airport and headed to the Grab driver that was waiting for me,\
  \ I knew that my life has changed forever. \n\nFor a month, I struggled to learn\
  \ Bahasa Indonesian just so I can get a job at companies who only hire either an\
  \ expat from the English speaking countries or a local who speaks fluent English\
  \ - an Asian who speaks fluent English and zero Bahasa Indonesian was never in the\
  \ category. Those were the painful days when I started doubting my capabilities,\
  \  and the goals I have for myself. Those were the times when even a large pack\
  \ of a  biscuit and mineral water was essential to my survival for a week; times\
  \ when I'd think a million times on spending a  single centavo just so I could survive\
  \ living abroad penniless without any help from my friends or relatives.\n\nMy landlord,\
  \ who noticed I had very limited finances even for food was kind enough to feed\
  \ me. The next day, I was throwing up and my body temperature was way below normal.\
  \ But I just landed a job at an international school, and in three days, I am supposed\
  \ to report for the first day of classes. I couldn't afford to be absent. I pushed\
  \ myself for another day before the head of school decided to have me checked-up\
  \ at a hospital. What a tragedy! I was diagnosed with typhoid fever in one of the\
  \ top tourist destinations in Asia! Probably one of the worst things that can happen\
  \ to anyone; especially to someone who is financially disabled.\n\nWhile I was battling\
  \ with a 40 C fever and endless muscle pains, I would always get up to watch the\
  \ sunset from my room. The view of the sun dipping below the horizon and the fleeting\
  \ vibrant colors of dusk and the red skies melting over the sea of green, rice paddies\
  \ became my medicine. Nursing myself while being awe stricken with the most breathtaking\
  \ sunsets I have seen in this lifetime helped me get better until I finally recovered\
  \ from that nightmare. A few weeks later and I met a Balinese guy who helped me\
  \ with my accommodation while I was waiting for my first salary and that made everything\
  \ just perfect. \n\nIt was a tough ride getting a job in a foreign country penniless,\
  \ but the universe brought the right people to my life- from my superiors to helpful\
  \ locals around me down to my most kindhearted landlord.   \nBali became more than\
  \ just a breathtaking tourist destination for me. It served as a  sanctuary when\
  \ I didn't know how it was to feel safe and secure. That whole new experience made\
  \ me realize a lot of things about myself, more importantly , of my life purpose:\
  \ to spread  kindness and humanity to the universe.\n\nI've seen tons of beautiful\
  \ sunsets from other parts of Asia that I have visited, but there in Bali, they\
  \ were just so special. They always come with a silver lining."
