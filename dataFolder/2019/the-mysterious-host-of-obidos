Text: "That spring morning came sunny in Lisbon. My heart woke up beating fast to\
  \ live new experiences and get to know new places. I put the most comfortable sneakers\
  \ I could find and boarded a bus to Obidos.\nI had already read some stories about\
  \ this city, but the expectation of finding out for myself drew a huge smile on\
  \ my face.\nThe route was short, something about an hour. From far away, I could\
  \ already see the beautiful citadel framed by a very well preserved Roman wall,\
  \ stopped in time and lonely in the middle of a bucolic rural area. A true treasure\
  \ preserved in the interior of Portugal.\nI whispered to myself: \u201CWhat surprises\
  \ await me behind those walls?\u201D\nSuddenly, the bus stopped. I said goodbye\
  \ to the friendly Portuguese sir that guided me there and i went down. Of course,\
  \ not without stumbling on the steps. I'm really very clumsy!\nThis place was much\
  \ more than the pages of the history books had described. Obidos looked like to\
  \ have been taken from a medieval tale. I paused for a moment in front of the beautiful\
  \ and imposing door of the village. I took a deep breath and, without any armor,\
  \ i invaded the fortification.\nWhen i crossed, what a big surprise!\nStanding there,\
  \ in front of me, in that magnificent chamber decorated with white and blue tiles\
  \ of the 18th century, typically Portuguese, a mysterious lord with long white beards\
  \ in medieval robes greeted me with welcome.\nWas he Gandalf, the wizard adviser\
  \ of the tales? Had I crossed any kind of Magic Portal?\nHis image was so real!\
  \ His robe and hat was so true to the original that I thought I was walking in a\
  \ book by J. R. R. Tolkien.\nA little more curious than usual, I got closer. And,\
  \ delighted with such likeness, I dared to ask more about him.\nVery kind and helpful,\
  \ although of the strong gust of wind that was blowing in the place, Gandalf considered\
  \ necessary to start telling me about the history of the village, before talking\
  \ about his own. And he made a complete historical account. It began with the Celtic\
  \ origin, around 308 BC, passed through the period of domination of the Visigoths\
  \ peoples, then the Romans, the invasion of the Moors, until the reconquest of the\
  \ territory to Portugal by D. Afonso Henriques in the mid-12th.  \nHe told me that\
  \ the sea was less than 3 km in a straight line. This is probably why the region\
  \ was considered a point of interest to various civilizations and it was constantly\
  \ target of invasions. On his eyes i could see his passion for those lands. And\
  \ in telling me about it, the reason for the glow in them was clear: he had a deep\
  \ connection to that place.\nHe was born there, in a blue house next to the church,\
  \ and there, he lived all his life. Until recently, he was painting frames with\
  \ his fingers to sell on the streets. He was always an artist. But one day, the\
  \ city's rules were changed and they banned the exposure of this kind of art on\
  \ the streets. He knowing the art was the essence of his life, he was forced to\
  \ reinvent himself to carry on living. So, he changed the form of expression and\
  \ he is still an artist until these days.\nIt was at that moment I understood what\
  \ was the unexpected surprise that those walls kept for me, what was the great story\
  \ that my anxious heart was looking for in Obidos.  No, it was not the one told\
  \ in the history books. Not even about a character from a classic of literature.\
  \ But the real story, of an anonymous artist, who was hidden behind his art."
