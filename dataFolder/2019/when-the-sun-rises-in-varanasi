Text: "Early morning, still dark. It was all quiet, I could only listen some cows\
  \ and monkeys outside. I wanted to stay a little bit more in bed, you know, when\
  \ you are on \"vacation\" the days are longer, so why to wake up that early?\nBut\
  \ I was in Varanasi, one of the holy citys in India and I wanted to see the sunrise\
  \ from the Ganges. I went outside, any noise, nothing. I walked through the streets\
  \ alone with curiosity and a little bit affraid, why not to recognise it. I am in\
  \ India and I am travelling solo... \nI reached the Ghats (the stairs that goes\
  \ untill the river) quickly, at the end Varanasi is a small city and most of the\
  \ hostels are close to the river. Once there I realize that in this place life never\
  \ stops. There were people bathing, walking and meditating near the holy waters.\n\
  My plan was to rent a boat and see the sunrise from the mother Ganga. Looking for\
  \ a boatman is very easy, you don't need to ask, they offer you a ride everywhere,\
  \ so you just have to decide which one you want to take. I can say that being in\
  \ a boat in the middle of the river while the sun was rising is by far one of the\
  \ most magical experiences I have ever had. You can see the burning ghats from there,\
  \ the birds flying over your head, the sound of the bells from the nearest temples.\
  \ If you want to live an experience where time stands still, this is the perfect\
  \ place to go."
