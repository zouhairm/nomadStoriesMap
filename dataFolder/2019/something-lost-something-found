Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to loot my grandparents\u2019 house but couldn\u2019t\
  \ resist the temptation. In 1997, my sister and I attempted to cross the green line\
  \ in Cyprus at a time when Greek-Cypriots were forbidden to travel to the occupied\
  \ north. Born in New York, we reconciled the guilt of our American privilege by\
  \ asking the border agent not to stamp our passports. The uniformed gentleman looked\
  \ at us, noted our Greek-Cypriot surname, and after what felt like an eternity stamped\
  \ a small paper insert and waved us through.\n\nWe soon discovered that our father\u2019\
  s village, occupied by Turkish troops since 1974, was off limits due to its proximity\
  \ to military bases. As a consolation, our Turkish-Cypriot taxi driver took us to\
  \ Bellapais, the village popularized by the author Lawrence Durrell in Bitter Lemons.\
  \ We congregated with tourists at the book\u2019s fabled \u201CTree of Idleness\u201D\
  \ and admired the beautiful cloister of the Abbey but nothing calmed my restlessness.\n\
  \nEight years later, I find myself crossing the green line again only this time\
  \ my cousin Andrikos is driving. The easing of border restrictions to bolster peace\
  \ between the island\u2019s Greek and Turkish communities has personal implications:\
  \ after more than thirty years my family can go home. I exhale as we pass the first\
  \ checkpoint, turning my head to ensure three carloads of relatives are following\
  \ behind us. Outside my window, Turkish signs and an enormous crescent and star\
  \ carved into a mountain overshadow my deeper desire: to discover something left\
  \ behind when my grandparents fled as refugees in 1974. They never returned to their\
  \ village before passing away and I\u2019m determined to bring back something meaningful,\
  \ even just a handful of soil.\n\nWe\u2019re seven miles north of Nicosia when Andrikos\
  \ points to a familiar marker: an 800-year old tree he recognizes from his youth.\
  \ The car stops at Ayios Prodromos, the oldest church in my family\u2019s village.\
  \  Entering through a missing door, I cringe as my sneakers sink into the dirt floor,\
  \ which smells of manure. Crumbling plaster walls yield to exposed brick. I look\
  \ up in awe at the ceiling: the outline of twelve dinner plates remains, each one\
  \ supplied by the founding families, among them my great-grandparents. Now bullet-ridden,\
  \ lingering pieces of porcelain reflect the sunlight passing through the arched\
  \ window.\n\nWe can walk to the house from here but drive instead, pulling up to\
  \ a stone and clay abode with a tall door, rectangular windows and wooden shutters.\
  \ Struck by how small it looks, the bewildered faces of my relatives emphasize time\u2019\
  s impact on perspective. Not wanting to overstay our welcome, we move quickly through\
  \ the house led by its present inhabitants, a hospitable family from Turkey. As\
  \ much as I try, I\u2019m unable to place my grandparents in this setting without\
  \ the distinct smell I associate with them: the heavy scent of incense. On the second\
  \ floor, where my cousin Toula lived as part of her dowry, she cries out in disbelief:\
  \ \u201CThe carpet\u2019s the same! Those are my light fixtures!\u201D \n\nHer discoveries\
  \ reignite my longing to find something personal. I gravitate to the outdoor kitchen\
  \ since my grandmother was always cooking. Beside it, a ramshackle shed is chained\
  \ shut. \u201CThat\u2019s where she kept her supplies,\u201D my Uncle Paul says,\
  \ pushing the rotting door with his shoulder. We push until the rusty chains loosen\
  \ and stumble inside. A mess of overturned furniture and jumbled belongings lies\
  \ before us: dust-covered olive barrels, twisted shoes, a small rusty wheel and\
  \ coiled around everything is some sort of plumbing tube. I gag inhaling the elements\
  \ accumulated over decades of neglect. \n \nA few minutes pass before I hear voices\
  \ approach the shed. I scan the room once more when my eyes catch a flicker of red\
  \ on the wall. Camouflaged beneath layers of dirt is a bottle wrapped in wicker.\
  \ I tear it off the hook and tuck it into my knapsack.  \n\nThat evening, I wash\
  \ it off allowing the red, blue and pink colors to reveal themselves. Studying it\
  \ like an artifact, I marvel at its condition. \u201CWhere did you get that?\u201D\
  \ Toula says, reaching to touch it. \u201CIt\u2019s our grandmother\u2019s incense\
  \ bottle. She used it everyday to bless our house.\u201D"
