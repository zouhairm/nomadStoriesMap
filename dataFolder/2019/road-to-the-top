Text: "My name is Muhammad Ramadhan, I am a student from Indonesia currently I\u2019\
  m living in Ahmedabad, India for a year long exchange program. At the last January,\
  \ I went to Himachal Pradesh. Actually, Himachal Pradesh is not a city. It\u2019\
  s a state, the most northern state of India before Kashmir. I stayed for a night\
  \ at Shimla and Manali, and also I passed Kullu and Kufri. I was with a group of\
  \ Indonesian students. The journey started at third of January and ends at seventh\
  \ of January, which was at coldest point in the winter season. One thing to know\
  \ that I\u2019ve been living my whole life in Jakarta which is a tropical and humid\
  \ city, so this is my first winter. The meeting point was the Delhi airport. We\
  \ got a minivan to explore Himachal and got a Punjabi driver. First I thought that\
  \ the journey will be tiring, because would traveled by car.\n\nWe supposed to arrived\
  \ at nine o\u2019clock at night, but we had to stop for a three times because a\
  \ trouble with the minivan. Actually, we almost reached Shimla but we stopped next\
  \ to a cliff. It was four degrees celsius, we can\u2019t see anything except the\
  \ road and we had to help the Punjabi driver to fix the car. I was in tension because\
  \ it we had to pass some hilly roads and it was freezing there. Finally we arrived\
  \ at Shimla at one o\u2019clock and we slept for a several hours.\n\nI woke up and\
  \ I surprise it was minus two degree celsius, the first time in my life I was below\
  \ zero degree. I tried hard to went out of the hotel, and it turns out that Shimla\
  \ had the best city view that I ever seen in my life. Shimla is a hilly city and\
  \ basically a mountain slope. The hotel where I stayed was at the top, so I could\
  \ see the roads down the hill. I could see houses and buildings down there, and\
  \ roads was magnificently round and it still preserve the mountain structure. The\
  \ buildings such as malls, houses, and hotels were unique, it was constructed strongly\
  \ and the first floor was the most upper floor, so the we had to go down to get\
  \ other facilities, not go up. The people at Shimla are way different than the other\
  \ parts of India. Their skin are fair, and their bodies are bigger just like European.\
  \ Honestly, it didn\u2019t feels like in India. And the most beautiful sights that\
  \ I saw from Shimla that there are many mountains around which are higher or lower\
  \ than the city, the mountains just like a protector to the city.\n\nThe day after\
  \ that, we passed Kullu to reach Manali from Shimla. Kullu was fascinating, even\
  \ I did not stay there. And Kullu was even different from Shimla, it looks like\
  \ Scotland with the large fields that I saw at the horizon, the trees had no leaves,\
  \ and the land was a beautiful green and red colored. We continued to go and just\
  \ one hour before we reached Manali, we saw snow for the first time. It was the\
  \ right time to visit Manali as it just started snowing as we stayed there for two\
  \ nights. Manali was beautiful, it one of the highest point in India. And I could\
  \ declare that I had visited the Himalayas. Manali was fully covered by snow, and\
  \ I had to wait until the last day when the snowing stopped until I can see a beautiful\
  \ sight of mountains that covered by snow, and the sunlight made the view of the\
  \ mountains clearer.\n\nIt was a beautiful journey, and some hardships and struggle\
  \ while traveling helps me to appreciate the beauty of Shimla and Manali which I\
  \ never expect before. Because the most important thing is not the destination,\
  \ but the process to get there."
