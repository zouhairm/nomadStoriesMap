Text: "I cannot say I\u2019ve always been an adventurous person. As a Scientist, I\u2019\
  ve always been taught that taking uncalculated risks were a reckless thing. But\
  \ as I was about to discover, that quick weekend trip to a forest in the middle\
  \ of Brazil would change dramatically the way I see the world.\nIt was a pleasant\
  \ Sunday at that end of December, 2018. Propelled by a painful love disappointment,\
  \ I had decided to come aboard an ecoadventure in a beautiful place called Brotas,\
  \ a very common place for Brazilian people, but quite unknown around the world,\
  \ recognized by your majestic Waterfalls and Rivers.  In ordinary conditions, a\
  \ trip to a place where a could not find a MCDonalds one square a apart from where\
  \ I was would be completely out of question. But at the time, in my ultra romantic\
  \ mind, the resistant thought was \u201CWhy not? It can\u2019t get any worse than\
  \ already is\u201D. \nAfter about 2 hours, we arrived at the destination. Since\
  \ the beginning, I was really impacted by the lived and intense green of the forest,\
  \ nothing compared with the colors we normally see on Instagram! Our Main objective\
  \ that day was to find and explore one of the most visited Waterfalls of the park,\
  \ the so called \u201CPedra do Sapo\u201D (or \u201CFrog\u2018s stone\u201D), rappelling\
  \ down it\u2019s almost 30 meters (which now I know it\u2019s not that big, but\
  \ for me, a metropolitan guy, that was like an empire state). We walked uninterruptedly\
  \ for about 30 minutes. When that fresh and moist air suddenly reached our faces,\
  \ we knew: We had arrived at our destination. \nThe river,  with its cold and fast\
  \ water flow, seemed to run unsteadily  towards an endless abyss, making a terrifying\
  \ and captivating noise, all together at the same time.  \nGathering a Bravery I\
  \ did not know I possessed (and lots of safety equipment), step by step I started\
  \ climbing down the walls of my new unusual friend. At the time, I tried to maintain\
  \ the control of the rappelling using the friction of my boots and pressure of my\
  \ legs, however, nature can be a hard teacher: On my 10th step, I slipped. I was\
  \ only hanging by the rope and a mix of fear and Adrenalin took over my body, in\
  \ a unique way. That heavy flow of water started to hit my head, nonstop, in a position\
  \ I couldn\u2019t barely breath.\nAfter a few moments of complete despair, I looked\
  \ down and noticed I was too far from the ground, but also too far to come back.\
  \ There was no way out: The only acceptable action was to keep going.\nI still don\u2019\
  t know the origin of it (and to be honest, I do not quite want to know), but suddenly,\
  \ I started hearing the voice of someone, telling me to  \u201Cnot fight the nature\u201D\
  . At this moment, instead of trying to use my strong to control the whole process,\
  \ I just decided to let the water and gravity take control of my body. And , As\
  \ magic, I started to move, very slowly, toward the ground.\nAfter a few minutes,\
  \ I reached the ground. Safe and Sound. But I felt myself\u2026different. Instead\
  \ of horrified and in anger for having lived such a stressful moment, I was happy\
  \ and calm. I realized I had loved the experience. An as a blink of an eye, an Idea\
  \ crossed my mind:\u201D What other things Am I missing in life for being afraid\
  \ of taking risks?\u201D \nToday, I can tell you for sure: Several Things! That\
  \ adventurous spirit I thought I didn\u2019t have, it was there, now alive and free.\
  \ Since then, I\u2019ve been exploring the world (and my world!) as much as I can,\
  \ getting to know places and people. The world has opportunities we cannot even\
  \ dream of! Deep inside all of us, there is always an explorer.\nNot everything\
  \ is controllable.  Sometimes, the best we can do is just let ourselves go with\
  \ the flow, like the water on that waterfall.\nThe person who started climbing down\
  \ the waterfall has never got to the ground. And all started on that unusual and\
  \ sudden weekend trip, that I will never forget."
