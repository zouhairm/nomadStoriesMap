Text: "I chose the seat across from a nun dressed in a full habit. We exchanged smiles\
  \ as I sat down. Looking at the ticket and note I held in my hand, I re-read the\
  \ scratchy writing. Despite my lack of Polish and the lack of English-speakers at\
  \ the train station, they had managed to communicate to me that I needed to switch\
  \ trains partway through my journey. Helpfully, the station I was to change at was\
  \ on the note, along with the train information.\n\nTurning my attention to the\
  \ window, I enjoyed the countryside rolling by as the train clattered along. The\
  \ late afternoon sun shone on the fields and woods. The train wasn\u2019t moving\
  \ very fast and it stopped at every station. I realized I would have to pay very\
  \ close attention if I wanted to get off at the correct stop. The train was old.\
  \ There were no digital screens or voice announcements indicating the next stop.\
  \ I was also worried about the time I\u2019d have to get from this train to the\
  \ next; assuming I\u2019d get off at the right place, I\u2019d have only five minutes\
  \ to find my train. \n\nI took the opportunity when my ticket was validated to try\
  \ to ask for help. He did try. But the language barrier meant I had absolutely no\
  \ idea what he was saying. I ended up nodding and smiling, attempting to pronounce\
  \ \u201Cthank you\u201D correctly in Polish (I failed). \n\nThe nun sitting across\
  \ from me must have realized that I didn\u2019t understand because she caught my\
  \ eye and pointed at my piece of paper after the man left. I showed her my ticket\
  \ and the note. Without a word, she indicated that she was getting off there as\
  \ well and would help me. I was relieved. For the rest of the train ride, I was\
  \ able to enjoy the views and worry less about what was on my ticket. \n\nAll too\
  \ soon, I felt a gentle tap on my knee. The nun pointed at the station outside which\
  \ we were slowly pulling up to. She shook her head then pointed down down the track,\
  \ back at the platform and nodded. Next station. I readied my bags as she, too,\
  \ gathered her belongings. As the train rolled to a stop, I followed her as she\
  \ stepped off the train onto the platform. According to the station clock, I still\
  \ had five minutes to make it to my next train. \n\nThis station was busy and happened\
  \ to be a bit bigger than the others we\u2019d stopped at. Before I could begin\
  \ panicking about which direction to go, the nun waved at me to follow her. I did.\
  \ \n\nShe led me down two flights of stairs, through a long tunnel and up another\
  \ set of stairs. I was huffing to keep up although she didn\u2019t appear to be\
  \ hurrying. She pointed to my train and beamed at me as I took her hand and thanked\
  \ her profusely in both English and bad Polish. I climbed onto the train and waved\
  \ to her out the window before she turned and disappeared into the crowd. \n\nI\
  \ didn\u2019t expect such kindness from a stranger, much less one who could only\
  \ communicate with me using gestures and smiles. While I'd never see her again,\
  \ her actions remained with me."
