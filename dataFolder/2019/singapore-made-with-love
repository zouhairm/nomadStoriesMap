Text: "Singapore was indeed an ideal destination to mark my big 30th birthday, with\
  \ a solo trip. \n\nA melting pot of electric cultures, encircled by genius man-made\
  \ architectural marvels, food hawkers serving their most delicious multi-culinary\
  \ adventures and much more. This entire island with its impeccable cleanliness was\
  \ a delight for those like me seeking fun, shopping & entertainment. I had enjoyed\
  \ a whole week of pleasure at this paradise...\n\nNow, with bags full of endless\
  \ spending\u2019s and a happy spirit I was heading back to the airport, soaking\
  \ in some last glimpses of the city. But something strikingly diverted my attention\
  \ through the car window...\n\nDwarfed by high skyscrapers surrounding it at this\
  \ buzzing business area, it amazed me how peacefully a temple stood there. Had few\
  \ hours before my flight to India, so I jumped off the cab with my luggage and walked\
  \ around to observe the site. Not exactly the glamorous Singapore that I had come\
  \ to know of during my stay there. \n\nOne man crossed me, \u201CPray for love!\
  \ Don\u2019t forget to tie a red string around god Yue Lao\u201D, he announced loudly.\
  \ I smiled back and said, \u201CI wasn\u2019t looking for love\u2026\u201D. \n\n\
  Was still contemplating to stop-by, when an old lady called out for help. I promptly\
  \ left my luggage at the door-side and rushed in to walk her. As she strolled slowly\
  \ with my support, I was astonished by this Chinese temple. \n\nOn reaching the\
  \ main hall, the old lady greeted everyone there. \u201CGood evening Ms. Kang\u201D\
  \ they replied. She then picked a bundle of incense sticks and shoved it into my\
  \ hand. Baffled; I carefully lit our sticks at the burner and handed them back to\
  \ her. She continued to wave the sticks in an elaborate pattern. Beautiful scent\
  \ and faint smoke enveloped us!  \n\nThe temple was made of intricate carvings.\
  \ Different animal frescoes embellishing the walls conveyed ancient folklore's &\
  \ stories. The idol of Yue Lao was now right before me sitting in the hall, his\
  \ neck adorned with many red strings hung. \n\n\u201CTake this red string\u201D\
  , the old lady ordered me. She softly muttered a prayer before hanging her string\
  \ around the deity\u2019s neck. I followed. \u201CHe\u2019ll find you romance\u201D\
  , she gleefully uttered. \n\nWe sat at a nearby wooden bench, still holding hands\
  \ we watched other love-seekers pray.   \n\n\u201CI come here every evening to see\
  \ the man I loved all my life. We never married each other you know?!. But I come\
  \ to pray for him. He is old, almost blind now\u2026He can hardly see anything.\
  \ Not even me\u201D, she said in her shaky voice. \n\nI comforted her. \n\nHow could\
  \ someone be that lovelorn? What was LOVE after-all? \n\nMs. Kang opened her bag\
  \ and pulled out a small container. \u201CI made some mooncakes. Take it with you,\
  \ it will bring you good luck\u201D. I took them, kissed her cheek. She smiled sheepishly.\
  \ Goodbyes were said. I left her at the bench, where she patiently continued to\
  \ gaze at everyone who entered.\n \nAs I made my way out through the courtyard,\
  \ I noticed an old man walking calmly, one step at a time\u2026young lad and a walker\
  \ supported him. I was sure and felt it deep in my soul, he was the same man this\
  \ beautiful lady I had just met, spoke about\u2026\n\nI leaped hurriedly towards\
  \ him. \u201CMs. Kang comes here every day, she sits inside the temple waiting for\
  \ you\u201D. The old man looked surprised, as he focused his eyesight from underneath\
  \ his spectacles. Pause. \n\n\u201CI know she comes here everyday. I come here each\
  \ day too, only to know she is doing fine. But she thinks I can\u2019t SEE her.\
  \ Truth is\u2026I-I don\u2019t have the courage\u2026\u201D. Tears streamed down\
  \ his face. \n\nI handed him Ms. Kang\u2019s mooncakes, \u201C\u2026it will bring\
  \ you good luck and some COURAGE!\u201D We looked into each other\u2019s watery\
  \ eyes and exactly knew what our hearts conveyed. \u201CThank you, I will try\u201D\
  , he said as he took the tiffin. Silently, we stood there in each other\u2019s presence\
  \ knowing-- there was a supreme emotion called LOVE that we all needed to have in\
  \ our lives. \n\nYue Lao was now smiling at me! Singapore had taught me to love\
  \ again!"
