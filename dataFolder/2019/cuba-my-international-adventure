Text: "I always thought that the trip completes us. The people say that when someone\
  \ falls in love the half of his soul it\u2019s given to the other part; so, my soul,\
  \ it\u2019s in every place I have visited, in every garden that I have stepped,\
  \ in each lagoon/beach where I have swum, in every flight I have been, in every\
  \ architecture that I have appreciated and in every person I have met. \n\nMy belief\
  \ in traveling, has always been the same, \"before you presume that you know the\
  \ world, know your country, so you can talk about it to the world\", in the last\
  \ 6 years, I have dedicated myself to discover places of Mexico, places that I've\
  \ always wanted to know, and now that I'm older, with a different mentality and\
  \ more mature, I've enjoyed it to the fullest.\n\nThis past February, I gave myself\
  \ the opportunity to travel to Cuba, a country that always has my interest, his\
  \ capital, his beach, his people, his party, his kind of life ...\n\nI like to travel\
  \ differently, I like to have fun, to know, to dare, to explore ... I love living\
  \ like a local, using their transport, eating in their restaurants, avoiding the\
  \ most touristy and coupling with their way of living.\n\nIn my days in Havana Vieja\
  \ I knew every street, every corner, I walked kilometers to explore the architecture\
  \ of the city.\n\nThere is a belief that foreigners can't use the national coin\
  \ in Cuba, I discovered that it's possible, we have the right to do so I did it\
  \ and it opened a lot of doors to the unconventional, such as its transportation.\n\
  \nI traveled all over Havana with a low price, from Havana Nueva to La Vieja on\
  \ a bus that hadn't been there for more than 20 minutes. During my trips on the\
  \ bus, I had the opportunity to appreciate emblematic buildings of the city.\n\n\
  My plans changed when, at the end of my route on the bus, I arrived at the Chinatown\
  \ that is inside of Havana Vieja, I hadn't eaten and I thought it was a good option,\
  \ I got into the neighborhood full of decorations and red flags with yellow that\
  \ adorned the streets.\n\nI found a restaurant that I had read a lot on the internet,\
  \ one of the most famous in Old Havana and Chinatown, I went and ate the best Chinese\
  \ food I've had in my life, they had an extensive menu for all tastes, it was a\
  \ perfect combination of Chinese dishes with Cuban cuisine.\n\nThe 8 days I was\
  \ in Cuba, where I enjoyed Havana and Varadero were not enough to enjoy every corner\
  \ of that caribbean island that falls in love with those who know it, those who\
  \ enjoy it, those who feel it."
