Text: "\u201CWhat have I gotten myself into?\u2019, was the only that kept crossing\
  \ my mind. An old uncle was snoring right by my side, I could barely fit inside\
  \ my sleeping bag and the cold breeze kept slapping my face from the corner of the\
  \ tent.\n\nI looked at Dwip. He was sleeping soundly, and I felt like cursing myself\
  \ for giving in to his persuasion. Being my roommate from college, it wasn\u2019\
  t difficult for him to convince me for this\u2026and even I was all too excited\
  \ to take this on. Having grown up in India watching Nat Geo and Discovery, I had\
  \ always visualized being one of them\u2026a traveler, an adventurer\u2026and here\
  \ I was, on my first Himalayan Trek.\n\nIt was the first night at our base camp,\
  \ Sankri\u2026a small and remote village located at the foothills of the Himalayas,\
  \ where we had travelled from Dehradun. I had enjoyed the drive\u2026met new people,\
  \ all very upbeat and excited like me. We played Antakshari, a traditional Indian\
  \ pastime where you must sing a song with the last letter of the previous one, dumb\
  \ charades and the likes on the ride. As our bus twisted and turned in the hilly\
  \ terrain, we witnessed the Ganga and Yamuna rivers and their confluence. We drove\
  \ by the Gangotri glacier\u2026the origin of the Ganges, caught glimpses of snow-covered\
  \ peaks at a distance\u2026and the feeling was ethereal.\n\nBut amidst this pristine\
  \ beauty, truth dawned upon me at night. I realized that I was going to scale the\
  \ Kedarkantha peak of 12,500 feet on ice and snow, with bare minimum necessities\
  \ and negative temperatures. \u201CWill I be able to do it\u2026shall I leave and\
  \ go back to my luxurious life of Mumbai?\u201D \u2026that\u2019s all I could think\
  \ of through the night.\n\nNext day was hectic. We packed our backpacks and lunchboxes\
  \ and headed forward under the able guidance of our trek leader. I kept on walking,\
  \ still apprehensive of my abilities, when suddenly I heard a sound. Realizing that\
  \ I was alone there, I stayed still and then I saw it. Amidst an amazing valley\
  \ of pine trees, swaying gently in the cool breeze, in front of snow-clad mountains\u2026\
  was a snow leopard strolling upwards and making a hissing sound. It was an unbelievable\
  \ sight. I knew that you had to be very lucky to spot one in the Himalayas\u2026\
  and it was there! Wow! Everyone came running over and was astounded. They kept thanking\
  \ me for spotting the fauna. I felt that I had done something noteworthy on the\
  \ trek.\n\nFinally, we reached Juda Ka Talaab, our first higher campsite. It had\
  \ a circular frozen lake and was surrounded by pine trees half covered in snow.\
  \ We took photographs and had our dinner by 6 pm as it grew dark sooner in the mountains.\
  \ Too tired of my first day\u2019s heroics, I decided to retire in my tent and catch\
  \ a good night\u2019s sleep. Suddenly, Dwip called me from outside frantically\u2026\
  and I dashed out to see if something was wrong.\nBut what I saw outside was magical\u2026\
  unexplainable in words. I gazed up into the sky\u2026and woah! It was pink\u2026\
  absolutely, literally\u2026PINK! My mouth was wide open\u2026it was so star-studded\
  \ that you could barely find an empty space. We all sat down and kept on looking,\
  \ without uttering a word. We saw all the constellations\u2026crystal clear, uncountable\
  \ shooting stars and also caught glimpses of a few satellites. Never had I seen\
  \ a view so mystical and spectacular\u2026and I just soaked in the moment. As a\
  \ kid I had always wanted to go to Australia and witness the Aurora Borealis. The\
  \ Himalayas had made my dream come true.\n\nI closed my eyes and thought what if\
  \ I had really gone back without doing this. I thanked God for providing me the\
  \ courage and empowering me to take this decision. The Himalayas had mystified me,\
  \ blessed me and had given me a new lease of life. I knew then then now I would\
  \ attempt the whole trek with renewed exuberance and determination\u2026and come\
  \ back with loads of memories as a better version of myself.\n\nI had taken a leap\
  \ into the unknown\u2026and I was glad that I did!"
