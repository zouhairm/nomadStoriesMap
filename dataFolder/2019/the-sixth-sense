Text: "22 May, 2008 - my first time in Nicaragua. On the way from Managua airport\
  \ to my destiny \xA8Popoyo\xA8, a small surfer village in the south, I could already\
  \ sense that this trip was going to be intense. As soon as we left the crowdy city\
  \ behind, I kindly asked the shuttle driver, Adonis, to turn off the radio so i\
  \ could absorb what i was about to explore during the next 3 months. I could hear\
  \ the wildlife giving a unique concert - a fusion of singing birds, croaking frogs\
  \ and once in a while, some moaning monkeys. Everywhere i looked it was piercing\
  \ green. Huge plants, leaves, exotic flowers and palm trees like skyscrapers. I\
  \ was really electrified by what my eyes were gazing. Tears started to run down\
  \ my cheeks while I was fully awake, saving frame by frame in my mind. Not only\
  \ was i overwhelmed of what i was seeing and hearing, I could actually feel the\
  \ high vibrations of this humble and hearty country. There were tingling sensations\
  \ all over my body, as if mother nature was uplifting my vibes to her frequency.\
  \ What a supernatural feeling! I really felt blessed. And on top of that, some wonderful\
  \ savage smells accompanied this happening... a fragrance of earth, flora, tropical\
  \ rain, fruits, burned fields and dusty roads. Let\xB4s say, the wild version of\
  \ Coco Chanel! ;) \nAfter an hour drive we stopped at a petrol station. It seemed\
  \ like the longest hour of my life, as if time wouldn\xB4t exist here. \xA8Timeless\
  \ place\xA8, popped up inside of me. I went out the car to stretch my legs a bit\
  \ when a Nica girl with small plastic bags filled with pink liquid was approaching\
  \ me. \xA8Pitaya\xA8, \xA8pitaya\xA8, \xA8pitayaaa\xA8 she was shouting with a big\
  \ smile and shiny eyes. She noticed my ignorance and explained  that it was juice\
  \ of a cactus\xB4 fruit. I was thirsty, but I didn\xB4t have any coins to buy some.\
  \ At that moment Adonis came back from paying the gasoline, he quickly understood\
  \ the situation and asked for two bags, one for me and one for himself! Again, i\
  \ felt a shower of sparkling sensations. A moved \xA8Gracias\xA8 came over my lips.\
  \ I waved the girl goodbye and she smiled back happily, holding the coins as if\
  \ they were gold. The rest of the trip i kept on staring out of the window, enjoying\
  \ the warm breeze while sipping my delicious juice. It tasted amazing - sweet, fresh,\
  \ tropical! All of my 5 senses were awake now! I couldn\xB4t ask for more. How simple\
  \ it suddenly was to be happy! I was so excited of having arrived in a place that\
  \ was making me conscious of how fulfilling it is to perceive stimulations, no matter\
  \ if from inside or outside. And I wondered \xA8What would life be without senses?\xA8\
  \ I didn\xB4t even think more than 3 seconds, when a voice inside of me clearly\
  \ said \xA8How boring!\xA8 I paralyzed for a moment while realizing that it was\
  \ the voice of my soul! I felt so reconnected, so alive. Adonis winked an eye through\
  \ the rearview, smiling as if he knew what was going on with me. After a while he\
  \ dropped me off at the hostal with a warm hug and said \xA8Pura Vida\xA8. What\
  \ a nice way to greet or say goodbye. I wouldn\xB4t be able to describe better the\
  \ way of being and living there. Pure life! \nThis is just the beginning of a long\
  \ story\u2026 And of course, not all experiences were  peace and love. Still, despite\
  \ the poverty, the dirt and the lack of sources and education, i can say that i\
  \ found another sense there, the 6th sense. Thanks to the people and energy of this\
  \ country, I discovered my intuition, my inner guidance. And I reconnected with\
  \ a part of me that i haven\xB4t even been really aware that existed. I still feel\
  \ infinite gratitude for all the insights and lessons i had during this trip. Life-transforming.\
  \ \nGRACIAS Nicaragua, blessed be!"
