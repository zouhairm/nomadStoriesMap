Text: "\"My friend. My friend. Wake up. The river is coming.\"\n ___\n\nThere are\
  \ these trees I know as \"whistling trees\". They grow in the little valleys between\
  \ the dunes where the water collects. Their roots teem with life. Their hollows\
  \ whistle when the wind blows, sounding like the low rush of a distant freeway.\
  \ We sleep under them for protection. Once, I dreamt of them speaking to one another.\
  \ They were considering me. Considering my home. Considering my family.\n\nLightning\
  \ flashed in the distance. The dunes were filling fast with water. \"See, the big\
  \ river,\" Mohamed said. Mohammed \u2013 always calm \u2013 was now in a hurry.\
  \ In two days as my guide to the great dunes of Erg Chigaga in southern Morocco\
  \ he had always remained carefree, almost to the point of indifference. He called\
  \ this place \u201CWaayi Letaaj,\u201D and said it had not rained here in many years.\
  \ I didn\u2019t mind getting wet or moving the tent, so I didn\u2019t understand\
  \ his worry now.\n \nIt was only later that Mohammed explained the river wasn\u2019\
  t about us but about the camels, who couldn't ford through the water and loosening\
  \ sand. We\u2019d be stuck at our little whistling tree, unable to escape this patch\
  \ of dunes. \n\nWe packed up quickly \xAD\u2013 food, fuel canisters, baggage, rugs,\
  \ tent, tarp \u2013 but the giant bundle of lumps and tent poles was too off balance\
  \ for one of the camels. The poor camel dug its toes into the sand and let out a\
  \ sad wail. Mohammed adjusted the load until the camel felt more comfortable. The\
  \ other camel became obstinate and took a few tries before he\u2019d agree to the\
  \ rope. We had pushed a lot that day and were all tired, but it didn\u2019t matter\
  \ now as this had to be done The night was deep. Only the stray cracks of lightning\
  \ lit the desert enough for us to see more than a few meters. The wind rose and\
  \ with it, the faded howl of whistling trees flushed the dunes. We took off in a\
  \ clumsy hurry to their sound.\n\nThe load on the camel spilled as we hurdled over\
  \ the dunes. We gathered and packed it again. Mohammed kept his hand on the camel\u2019\
  s head after we fixed the load. \u201CI\u2019m sorry my friend,\" he told the camel\
  \ in English. The camel, speaking only French and Arabic, did not understand. Mohammed\
  \ did not want the camel to witness his embarrassment. He did not want the camel\
  \ to hear his apology.\n\nThe obstinate camel followed me but nipped at my shoulder\
  \ in displeasure. We finally found a dune that would lead us out to the flat lands\
  \ of sun-cracked earth. We threw off the bundle at the top of the dune\u2019s ridge\
  \ and decided to sleep there out of the flooding but exposed to everything. The\
  \ rain hammered us before we could set up the tent. We hid under whatever we could\
  \ pile on \u2013 blankets, tarp, rugs. I shivered, listening to the raindrops pellet\
  \ the tarp as I buried myself under searching for one spot of reprieve, one spot\
  \ less cold and wet, less rough against my skin with coarse pasted sand. Mohammed\
  \ got out to try to sing to the camels to keep them calm. I slept slopping wet and\
  \ cold in the rain, shivering too hard to sleep at first but then passing out from\
  \ the exhaustion. Mohamed did not sleep, he only cared for his camels, singing to\
  \ them through the whole night.\n\nI woke up the next morning cold and shivering.\
  \ I threw off the layers of soaking blankets and rugs. The obstinate camel picked\
  \ up its head right in my face and, after a momentary pause, continued chewing cud\
  \ without a care. Mohammed was making tea on a small fire. Behind him, the dunes\
  \ were filled with water where the whistling trees grew. They were silent now. They\
  \ were calm."
