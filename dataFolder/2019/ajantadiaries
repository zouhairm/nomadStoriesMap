Text: 'one fine morning we planned a family trip to Ajanta caves in mumbai india.
  We took a boat and crossed the sea to reach the caves. The blue waters were sparkling
  in the sunshine. we reached the entry gate at 10 30 am. we started climbing stairs
  and observed small shopkeepers selling glass-bangles, handicraft items. The entire
  landscape was beautifully painted with colours and hues of crimson red and sky blue
  filled the sky. There were handmade embroided dupattas which i purchased for my
  friends. We crossed almost 100 shops on our way. finally we saw old buildings and
  some pillars made of iron which had no rust even after 500 years. The view was breathtaking
  and paintings were no less than marvel. The designs of the caves were unparalled
  and matchless.  There were paintings of white marble which was shining in the sunshine.
  The tourist guide took us to old temples, the rooms of kings and queens. Each painting
  had a different story to tell like it was leap into the unknown. we took lunch in
  old dhaba . The sumptous food was served in clay plates and buttermilk in kullad"glass
  made of clay".


  After that we explored the beautiful gardens which has lush green trees and exotic
  flowers. It reminded of the quote" A thing of beauty is joy forever". There were
  honey bees hovering over the sun-flower. There was smell of roses lingering all
  over.


  At the end we went to the hill-side and saw the sunset. It was ecstatic and surreal.
  It was a great experience all together. The experience was one of its kind and refreshing.
  Caves are the most amazing places to explore. They tell you about the history and
  people.'
