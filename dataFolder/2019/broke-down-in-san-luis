Text: "Taking a 12-hour overnight bus ride from Buenos Aires to Mendoza was one of\
  \ the last spurs of the moment trips that I had planned in the duration of my semester\
  \ stay in Argentina\u2019s capital. My experience with charter buses was limited\
  \ to my occasional Megabus trip from Baltimore to New York. That prepared me to\
  \ appreciate the premium sleep experience I would have with comfortably uninstructive\
  \ reclining seats on the charter bus that was scheduled to hold me for 12 hours.\
  \ Nothing can show you a place more than driving cross country on their roads. \
  \ As the bus traveled along the night it periodically stopped for people along the\
  \ way. Some spots were large bus terminals while others were simple bus stops in\
  \ a small town. By the time I had hit an undisturbed slumber the bus was filled\
  \ from top to bottom with people. \n\nIt was hot and stuffy when I had woke up.\
  \ The bus was parked idle on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. At least\
  \ there did not appear to be an exit to a town in site. I saw the irritation on\
  \ the face of the other passenger and when I had asked the gentleman next to me\
  \ why we had stopped I learned the bus had broken down.  The alfajores and caf\xE9\
  \ that had been delegated one by one to each passenger earlier in the ride were\
  \ now free and unattended for any passenger to take at their free will. There was\
  \ no phone signal and once hour two had settled in, I had eaten too many alfajores\
  \ to keep count. I decided then to venture from my seat on the second tier of the\
  \ bus. \n\nI joined the other passengers outside for fresh air and conversation.\
  \ A lot of people riding had joined the ride from the last bus stop at a large bus\
  \ terminal in San Luis. I got a fair share of questions to pass the time, like why\
  \ I was taking a 12-hour bus ride to Mendoza. It was obvious I was not a local.\
  \ Especially with my lack of knowledge about popular local club soccer teams. I\
  \ could only stare in confusion at their enthusiasm on the subject. The passengers\
  \ took humor in what I did not understand about Argentina, but they were also willing\
  \ to teach me as well accompanied by alfajores and lukewarm caf\xE9. Not only did\
  \ I make local connections, but I got perspective about what being Argentinean meant\
  \ outside the big city of Buenos Aires. \n\nFour hours on the side of the road seemed\
  \ to fly by. What could have been a miserable experience, being broke down in the\
  \ middle of nowhere during the summer, was one of the truest experiences I had traveling.\
  \ I found precious moments in the bumps and making face to face connections with\
  \ people when you can."
