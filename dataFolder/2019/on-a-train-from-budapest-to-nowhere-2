Text: "You\u2019ve heard of Newton\u2019s first law of motion. Probably his second,\
  \ third and fourth as well. I bet you haven\u2019t heard of Newton\u2019s fifth\
  \ law, though. Newton\u2019s fifth law states that when a train is in motion, its\
  \ occupants will engage in philosophical conversation. Our vessel on the 22nd of\
  \ December was a blue sleeper train, constructed from old metal and Communism. It\
  \ travelled at an average of 50 kilometres per hour. Slow enough to allow 14 hours,\
  \ between Budapest and Bucharest, for a deep discussion to amount, but fast enough\
  \ to create a sense of purpose and direction. We were always open to the budget\
  \ option, and valued adventure over comfort, so after half-heartedly looking for\
  \ someone to ask about a sleeper compartment, we gave up and opted for four seats\
  \ facing each other with a table in between.\nMy friend and I were caught in transit\
  \ between two life stations, the \u2018lost girls of Neverland\u2019, searching\
  \ for meaning. Today our conversation was about free will. We asked each other,\
  \ \u2018Is what we think is free will simply a biological process that we don\u2019\
  t yet fully understand?\u2019, \u2018Can you really steer your vessel in a direction\
  \ that is independent of any influence?\u2019 I could predict the direction in which\
  \ her life would go. She is the type of girl who throws away a book in disdain if\
  \ she finds out the love interest dies, refusing to read another page. She would\
  \ finish uni, marry her boyfriend of three years and settle down somewhere near\
  \ Sydney. Four kids, a comfortable and happy life until death. I, on the other hand,\
  \ would never commit to anything and live in a constant state of uncertainty until\
  \ the day I die. If she was a novel of the fairy tale kind, I was one of dystopia.\
  \  We agreed that people are fairly predictable based what they\u2019re made of\
  \ and where they come from; the nature and nurture debate. Even this conversation\
  \ we were having was an annoying clich\xE9. \nAs our train trundled further into\
  \ the night, we became aware of a silver-eyed stranger who had appeared on the outskirts\
  \ of our circle of existentialism. \n\u201CSorry to intrude, I heard of this poem\
  \ yesterday that reminds me of you.\u201D He leant over the aisle and handed us\
  \ a sliver of meaning. Actually, it didn\u2019t make much sense at first. Our heads\
  \ bowed over the table between us in silence, as we read and re-read the poem, trying\
  \ to decipher it, hoping to present the stranger with a package of intelligent interpretations.\
  \ \u201CTwo travellers went to sleep almost every night...\u201D \u201Cthe sleep\
  \ was old, the travellers were young\u2026\u201D We read in unison down to the final,\
  \ slightly morbid epilogue. \u201CVisiting death \u2018till they\u2019d outstayed\
  \ their welcome. Visiting death \u2018till the right disguise worked.\u201D We landed\
  \ back in the present. Naomi, unsurprisingly, thought it was simply about an old\
  \ married couple who went to sleep together every night. I was undecided. The stranger\
  \ was unsure as well, but he told us the backstory. The author, Leonard Cohen, visited\
  \ a foreign town where he arrived with no accommodation. He met two young travellers\
  \ in a doorway, and they invited him to share their accommodation for the night.\
  \ They all fell asleep together, although Cohen, tossing and turning, got up and\
  \ wandered the streets and wrote this poem, which he sung for the two travellers\
  \ as they woke up. \nWe were unsure of a deeper meaning of the poem, but we enjoyed\
  \ the timbre of the verses and the weirdness of the words. Both of us agreed that\
  \ human connection is something that runs beyond culture or language. It is something\
  \ that feels divine. The beauty of the poem, and of life itself, is the unexplained,\
  \ the coincidences and the time and chance.\nOur conversation cut off when the train\
  \ stopped at the border of Hungary and Romania and our passports were stamped. Then\
  \ we talked to the stranger about his upbringing in Communist Romania and his travels.\
  \ He was on his way home for Christmas. Sure enough, we found ourselves slowly being\
  \ rocked to sleep together by the creaking arms of the train, the rhythm of the\
  \ poem echoing around my brain. One-dreamed-of-Asia-one-stole-Nijh-isky-the-long-mar-riage-in-the-dark.\
  \ We woke up to the clacking of train wheels, the sun and a gift. The traveller\
  \ was gone, but he left a note: \u201CI hope your life holds many surprises, and\
  \ I hope meeting again will be one of them\u201D."
