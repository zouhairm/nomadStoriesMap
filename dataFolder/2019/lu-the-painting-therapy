Text: "I can still remember the smell. It\u2019s the combination of sweat, medical\
  \ alcohol and straw mats, continuously fermented in a high-temperature environment.\
  \ Following the smell, now I\u2019m walking on the staircase of Children\u2019s\
  \ Hospital of Thanh Hoa, Vietnam. It was a three-story building covered with white\
  \ moldy tiles inside. The hot air casts a warm-colored filter on the eyes. The fans\
  \ rotated languidly. Here it is- the rows of iron beds placed side by side in the\
  \ narrow wards, the children and adults curling on the beds and floor, and Lu, the\
  \ little boy in blue jumped to me, waving his hands clumsily. Once again, I\u2019\
  m back to the scene.\n\nDuring my journey in Vietnam, I participated in an international\
  \ voluntary activity, \u2018smile for children\u2019. Due to the effects of remaining\
  \ chemical weapons from the Vietnamese War, there are still many local children\
  \ with congenital physical deformation. While the doctors were offering surgeries,\
  \ my mission was to accompany and take care of the hospitalized children. Situated\
  \ between Laos and Beibu Gulf, Thanh Hoa is an ordinary city away from any Vietnamese\
  \ \u2018metropolises\u2019. The new-born factories kept releasing thick black smoke,\
  \ the symbol of emerging urbanization and development. A few sounds of motorcycle\
  \ engines made the streets even quieter at dawn. In such hot weather, both the pho\
  \ and coffee provided in breakfast were so boiling hot, which I felt incredible\
  \ about. But until the mid-day, I realized it\u2019s too early to complain about\
  \ the heat.\n\nSuffering from headache, I was sitting in a corner of the ward, where\
  \ is the only available place to take advantage of the fan. My teammates were teaching\
  \ the children how to use colored plasticine and crayons to paint whatever they\
  \ liked. Except several naughty boys making trouble, most of them were carefully\
  \ following the instructions. Suddenly, a little finger tentatively poked at my\
  \ arm. That was my first impression of Lu. He handed me a small bottle of \u2018\
  marching pills\u2019 and whispered something in his mother tongue, innocently.\n\
  \nHe is a different child. By saying different, I don\u2019t mean his overlong deformed\
  \ nose or somehow hollow cheeks. Sitting alone by the bed, he could patiently finish\
  \ a complicated paint. Sometimes other boys ran to him wildly and turned the paint\
  \ into a mess, he frowned unpleasantly and pushed them away. Once he added any detail,\
  \ a buffalo or a butterfly, he would bashfully show off to me and trace the contours\
  \ again and again until they looked smooth.\n\nLu knew I\u2019m from China. He dragged\
  \ my clothes, asking me to see him drawing. There were two head-to-head boats, one\
  \ with Vietnamese national flag, the other with Chinese flag, on which he mistakenly\
  \ drew one more star. He wrote \u2018Vi\u1EC7t Nam\u2019 on one side, and urgently\
  \ put the crayon in my hand, pointing at the blank space on the other side. Having\
  \ realized what he meant, I held his tiny hand and \u2018drew\u2019 the characters\
  \ of \u2018China\u2019 slowly. Finally, he drew a big crossing fork in the middle\
  \ and shook his head desperately, saying in Vietnamese, \u2018No!\u2019\n\nThe scene\
  \ was hidden deeply in my mind, when I left Vietnam, when I was in the military\
  \ service, when the combat readiness alerts were upgraded during South China Sea\
  \ Arbitration. The scene ceaselessly recurred every day- the smell of the hospital,\
  \ from the staircase, to the corridor, and Lu jumped to me, then he showed me the\
  \ two-boats paint. Oddly, a soldier should be responsible to fight with enemies.\
  \ However, holding my snipper in the platoon, I was hesitant where the muzzle should\
  \ take aim. Lu has become the power to keep my longing for peace and justice, even\
  \ during the tensest time. I know that during Lu\u2019s growth, he also needs a\
  \ power, that is, the love and care rooted in his little head, to face the affliction\
  \ of diseases and the pain of the unknown. Even if it\u2019s subtle, I hope I once\
  \ was a part of that power."
