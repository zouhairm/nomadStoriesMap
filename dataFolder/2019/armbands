Text: "I was the last kid in my class to learn how to swim. I used armbands in every\
  \ session, clung onto the edge and pretended I was floating. It took me years to\
  \ put my head under the water. Which is why, when I found myself on a beautiful\
  \ summer\u2019s day preparing to leap into Lake Geneva, I didn\u2019t entirely feel\
  \ like myself.  \n\nBy that point, however, I\u2019d spent a week in uncomfortable\
  \ situations. Having dealt with clawing a passport back from an Embassy and locking\
  \ myself out of my apartment to name a few hurdles, using my alarmingly rusty French\
  \ to chat with the distinguished looking man next to me on my bus that morning revealed\
  \ that Perle du Lac was the spot to experience the best of the lake, I was uncharacteristically\
  \ overcome with the impulse to take a risk.  \n\nI called some friends and, given\
  \ Geneva\u2019s blessedly small size and admittedly excellent public transport system,\
  \ within an hour I was standing on some rocks, the sparkling clear blue water lapping\
  \ against my trembling feet. Then I was in.  \n\nIt was freezing. As the searing\
  \ sun of the September heatwave bathed my shoulders, the icy waves felt like daggers\
  \ on my skin. And it was glorious. In an entirely secluded area, the view back towards\
  \ Bel Air was spectacular, the imposing stature of the Jet d\u2019Eau glistening\
  \ in the sky, the doll\u2019s house style of the lakeside buildings completing the\
  \ postcard picture perfectly.  \n\nAs I treaded water, watching my friends clear\
  \ the path for some swans to safely pass by, the tourist boats filled with beaming\
  \ elderly passengers waving from the decks in the distance, I was filled with a\
  \ sense of life. I swam to the next pier, the chatter of families sipping ros\xE9\
  \ at the lakeside fondue chalet, inhaled the clearest of mountain air and took a\
  \ mental to look up how far away the imposing stature of Mont Blanc really was,\
  \ my otherwise sound geographical knowledge having been replaced by a sensation\
  \ of awe at the sheer natural beauty by which I was surrounded. \n\nI sit in my\
  \ current flat with two scars on my foot and a photo from that day on the wall.\
  \ It turns out the combination of my weak swimming and the waves produced by the\
  \ aforementioned tourist boat resulted in some sharp cuts from the lake bed's rocks.\
  \ Yet they became reminders. Reminders not to be held back by fear. Reminders to\
  \ chat with people on buses and hear their stories. Reminders that you should always\
  \ carry some plasters, that swans are more intimidating than you\u2019d think, and\
  \ that our beautiful planet is there to be explored. Even if you need some armbands\
  \ at first."
