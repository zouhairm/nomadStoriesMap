Text: "I write in a way which I see is best sought; a poem I bring and have brought\
  \ to you now. A story loud! profound! and definitely not on the ground.  A long\
  \ river, a thousand islands, a lost boy scout group, and a bunch of alligators.\
  \ I was age 14 like the crew carrying a light, black cheap android phone that has\
  \ been in the washer twice, and reflective blanket. A boy scout is prepared I am\
  \ aware. We headed off paddles lifting and sometimes drifting. Alligators around\
  \ we continued as they dont mind our presence, our current essence. Talking about\
  \ all sorts of things seeing flora and fauna spring. Giant \u201Cmountains\u201D\
  \ to a florida man-lush green bands. Twists and turns the everglades talks, we construe\
  \ our vision which is not as locked. GPS drowned soaked and broke. Map not aligned\
  \ --- a pretty terrible sign. Lost around 5:00, light begins to go down a couple\
  \ of hours from this time. Look around map unaligned GPS soaked 1,000 islands found,\
  \ alligator eyes searching around. We sit sometimes peeing on canoe from the side\
  \ of the ship. Everyone looked at their phones, signal lost, signal unknown\u2026\
  \ A moment\u2026. we freak out we want to sneak out somehow. I pull my phone---\
  \ out one signal found, I speak out loud \u201CI have one bar\u201D though my power\
  \ is subpar. \u201C be prepared\u201D plays in my head why did I use my phone till\
  \ it was dead? The same phone plan is used by my family! comes to my head, my heavy\
  \ head losses its dread. My mom and bro have the same phones, the batteries the\
  \ same, and their batteries become loaned. Screaming loudly seemed the best option\
  \ as I phoned 911 as most of the group continuously moaned. Mission impossible dusk\
  \ and dark I use my light, scout leaders hold the blanket to encourage sight. Alligators\
  \ seem around with loud splashing sounds in the background. Mosquitos were aware\
  \ of our presence and wanted our blood so they dug through our clothing making us\
  \ itch and grunt. I was fast getting information amassed.\n\n\n\nOne scout leader\
  \ stayed behind in case something happened on the dime. When it became late he became\
  \ unsure if our presence was near, it was not, and action was clear. A crab fisherman\
  \ was the answer, he talked to him and got a deal to find us on his wind boat. Achieved\
  \ they decided to make their leave. The trusty steed looked around screaming loud,\
  \ looking... looking nobody found. Hours gone by not a person in sight, not even\
  \ our shining light. Back to the plight eaten by mosquitoes fortunately no gators\
  \ actually in sight. Late at night 10pm passes by, the thought of creating a platoon\
  \ and staying overnight \u201CWhy not give it a try?\u201D says a scout getting\
  \ eaten by flies. 10:30pm I told the crew, \u201Cthe police are coming\u201D pinpointed\
  \ us and now that boat started running. 11:00 came, bug bitten, text continuously\
  \ emitted. Tired souls we shine the light off the reflective blanket to catch the\
  \ boats sight. Waves came about faster pounced us with some might. We screamed ,a\
  \ joyous group, pooped from the day expending energy feeling simply just okay. Taking\
  \ some of what we needed jumped on the boat where we were seated. Trying not to\
  \ fall asleep, the beauty of the night and mist felt a marvelous dream. Once coming\
  \ back our land Crew Leads arms to his hips looked at the group and said , \u201C\
  put up your tents\u201D. My brother and I put up our tent in our current mess, almost\
  \ falling asleep on the tent. The most tired I have been a day and felt unpresent.\
  \ The almighty words we say in scouts \u201Cbe prepared\u201D rang about. A sturdy\
  \ simple cheap phone washed in the washer makes a world of difference while the\
  \ expensive ones faltered. So many issues could have occured that night, but  with\
  \ delight I brought what I needed from my own insight. Possibility of preparation\
  \ next time would not have been such a crime. Little things could have changed within\
  \ our grip, but what adventure would I be talking about? Just a simple canoe trip."
