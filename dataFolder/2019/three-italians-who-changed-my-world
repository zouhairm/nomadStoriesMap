Text: "If someone told me that all this would happen to me, I would not have believed\
  \ it ...\n\nThis is a true story happened to me a few years ago. My passion for\
  \ traveling began from this trip. \n\nMy friend invited me to a wedding in Nice,\
  \ but we quarreled for three days before my departure. I didn't want to pass the\
  \ tickets and the French visa was ready. I decided - I will fly! This was my first\
  \ trip abroad.\n\nI did not expect to live in a hostel with my finances and I decided\
  \ to try to go through the Couchsurfing system. I wrote to several persons and booked\
  \ for the whole week with three hosts. It seems to be all very simple and good,\
  \ but on the day of departure, everything was wrong. If you believe in mysticism\
  \ and signs, you will understand what I am talking about. I forgot my passport at\
  \ home, and then I got stuck in traffic. In the end, I just flew into my plane before\
  \ I could catch my breath. \n\nI wrote to my first acquaintance when I arrived,\
  \ but he didn't get in touch. The picture is fun - I'm with a suitcase, half-empty\
  \ street, palm trees, and so dark outside. Finally, someone shouted at me and it\
  \ was Kirill from Russia. Turn up he lived with his neighbor Dima, but I did not\
  \ know about that beforehand. Having stayed with them for one day, I realized that\
  \ I needed leave as soon as possible They were very strange boys. I packed my suitcase\
  \ and went to the seafront to come up with a plan. I didn't have money to stay at\
  \ the hostel, and the next reservation from the host was only three days later.\
  \ What can I do in such situation in an unfamiliar country? \n\nIn a few minutes\
  \ after my nervous thoughts, three cheerful Italians approached me and asked me\
  \ to take a photo. This photo was the beginning of our friendship and my new place\
  \ of residence. The remaining days I lived in their apartment right in the city\
  \ center. Italian lifestyle on the Cote d'Azur: the pleasure of eating, talking,\
  \ singing, dancing. They know how to enjoy life! One of them was the chief of a\
  \ restaurant in Milan and he taught me how to cook medium rare steaks, and his friend\
  \ sang in the choir and told the secrets of the correct notes. Their friend Helen\
  \ just taught me how to dive. The first time I made a jump from a cliff directly\
  \ into the water into the unknown. This was the most important test in my whole\
  \ life. Fear collided with pleasure, and I pushed the boundaries of my world. Go\
  \ to live in unknown people, meet on the street and move to even more unknown people,\
  \ jump off the cliff ... Do you say that I am crazy? Maybe, but isn't this a struggle\
  \ with fears and the opening of new frontiers?\n\nIf I hadn\u2019t quarreled with\
  \ my friend, I would have spent all my days on the beach with her and her husband\u2019\
  s family, but life had decided otherwise. These three Italians were sent to me by\
  \ fate, to show how you can have fun and not be afraid to take a step into the unknown.\
  \ After all, behind the veil of fear lives pleasure. Do not be afraid, get it!"
