Text: "I\u2019m not a morning person so a flight at 7:35AM was already a tough start\
  \ for me but that\u2019s how me and my dad began our first trip to the Netherlands.\
  \ We landed in Eindhoven, with a vague plan of going to Groningen and figuring it\
  \ out then. Stepped out of the plane, missed a few buses until figuring out how\
  \ to buy a ticket and got to the center, already sweating because of the +35\xB0\
  C weather. The hostel was at a 20-minute walk and the check in was only available\
  \ from 12:00 so we talked the employees into letting us leave our suitcases (with\
  \ money and everything) in the corridor and moving on to hit the Starbucks, Taco\
  \ Bell and a coffeeshop, because for Eastern European people things like that are\
  \ a luxury. We stayed at Lighthotel Eindhoven for a night, falling asleep to Lithuanian\
  \ tourists talking, and smoking weed just under our balcony. The next day we took\
  \ a train to Groningen. I really appreciated the transferring plan they printed\
  \ for us, because I would definitely get lost without that. The cutest places in\
  \ Groningen are anywhere by the canal, that\u2019s where we sat \u2013 in a place\
  \ that we later named the Pirate Port \u2013 while my dad was smoking, and I was\
  \ eating my first Ben&Jerrys while trying to figure out where to sleep tonight.\
  \ I didn\u2019t want him to spend a lot of money and the hotels were too expensive\
  \ for my understanding, so I had messaged tons of people on Couchsurfing who all\
  \ had successfully ignored me until a guy named Mark messaged me that he is able\
  \ to host us and show around the city. I had never done Couchsurfing before, so\
  \ I didn\u2019t know how it works, but it was amazing. His place was in 19th floor\
  \ next to a small pond in a friendly neighborhood. The whole city could be seen\
  \ from his balcony, the apartment was huge, he had two spare bicycles and after\
  \ us staying there for a couple of days he offered for us to stay for almost a week,\
  \ because he had to go on a trip to Amsterdam. We went to have dinner together in\
  \ a caf\xE9 in the middle of a huge park and tried Dutch beers, Bitterballen and\
  \ a lot of fried stuff before going home and having the best sleep. While we were\
  \ staying in his place, we were basically living off tomato soup, coffee and waffles.\
  \ The best food we had was in Vismarkt though, which is still my favorite place\
  \ \u2013 it\u2019s a market square with a lot of street food options and that\u2019\
  s where we had Belgian fries, some kibbeling \u2013 deep fried fish \u2013 while\
  \ surrounded by birds trying to steal it, warm, crunchy stroopwaffels made in front\
  \ of our eyes, churros, poffertjes with way too much butter and went to Albert Heijn\
  \ which was in a building way too fancy for a supermarket. The next days we were\
  \ alone in the apartment but tried not to spend too much time indoors. My dad is\
  \ a drummer, so we cycled to a huuuge music store Tonika a bit further from the\
  \ center and after that a punk music concert in Lola which left me half deaf. Everyone\
  \ here rides a bicycle and oh boy what a challenge it is to keep up with the fast\
  \ pace and properly hit the brakes not to annoy people behind you, not fall and\
  \ understand when it\u2019s your turn to go at the crossroads. To try something\
  \ different, we went to The Northern Maritime Museum which consists of old Dutch\
  \ ships which was quite boring, but good for silly pictures. The last night we stayed\
  \ at a Russian ladies airbnb and left the next day with a minivan we found the last\
  \ minute as well. It took us 24 hours on the road to get home, but we had the best\
  \ mexican wraps from a gas station in Germany and tried to sleep most of the time.\
  \ \nThis trip was when I fell in love with the Netherlands and all the things here,\
  \ so it was continued by exploring Amsterdam and so much more."
