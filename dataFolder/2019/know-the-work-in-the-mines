Text: "I do nota know how to describe the countless feeling that are me when I imagine\
  \ a next destiny and this is a sufficient reason to wish a travel in another country\
  \ but this is not a reality for all and that why my story is about a simple trip\
  \ in the city of Amethyst of the South in the State of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\_\_\
  \ One weekend was little to appreciate that small city whit little distance from\
  \ where I live and of only 7.537 inhabitant. I stay at a friend's house where all\
  \ your family has an interior acent and eat an original gaucho barbecue it was different\
  \ but increadible. Could not be expected less from someone as social as me I made\
  \ friend on the first day, with a pool party and I also learned how to play \"Canastra\"\
  , so it's called in Brazil. \n\_\_ Second day I net tourest spots such as S\xE3\
  o Gabriel parish, build with stones that the gold miner donated and this visited\
  \ costs only 1,29 dolares. Impressive was when I visited the Amethyst park and museum\
  \ and discover the beatiful work that is done in the mines. I made the tour in the\
  \ mines in a cart that passed by every beatiful stone already found with a man available\
  \ to answer questions. The day was very hot so the sensation in the mines with a\
  \ colder temperature was wonderful. I also went to the museum and learned that each\
  \ stone is different by it's color and size, the more purple,more valuable. I tasted\
  \ wines, I bought stones and gifts for the family and I can not forget to tell you\
  \ that the night we went to the Plateau town in a bar, se a heard good music, met\
  \ new people, had dinner and we drink beer.\_ \n\_\_ On sunday I said goodbye to\
  \ everyone and come back with heart and already waiting to come back. I Will nevee\
  \ forget that sometimes the best trip is the shortest and simplest vir the most\
  \ intense of moments and knowledge."
