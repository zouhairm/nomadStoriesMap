Text: "I sense their profound presence, the mountains crouching round. \n\nThis land\
  \ that echoes itself, that pushes in every direction, and unravels. \n\nAnd Brennisteinsalda,\
  \ that old great pink and blue volcano, ancient Japanese steam unfolding and releasing,\
  \ one day she will stand up and walk. \n\nThe night before I go to Landmannalaugar\
  \ I dream about the mountains. Barren earth stretched over everything, plants that\
  \ grow close to the ground. Black sand settled over so many years.\n\nWe started\
  \ hitchhiking from Hverager\xF0i in the afternoon. The ring road lay before us and\
  \ our friends waited at Landmannalaugar. Today we would enter the heart of the Icelandic\
  \ highlands.\n\nWe waited for an hour or so in the dust, anxious for the mountains,\
  \ as time gathered up. \n\nA car pulled in. Winding down his window, a smiling tattooed\
  \ Icelandic man. We got in and our journey began. Our driver talked of Mt. Hekla,\
  \ \u2018the hooded one\u2019, a nearby volcano, and in medieval times, the gateway\
  \ to hell. He promised it would explode in the next few weeks, and invited us to\
  \ watch it from his place.\n\nThe car picked up speed, onwards into the south, moving\
  \ through transforming landscape. My attention was caught by deep mountains on the\
  \ horizon. These mountains arose within me something deep and wild.\n\nOur driver\
  \ took us as far as Hella. Then we got out on the side of the road and the wind\
  \ was fierce and wild.\n\nWe started to walk along the ring road, backpacks on,\
  \ thumbs out. Lingering at the point where the F26 departs from the ring road and\
  \ into highland territory, we know that it is not certain we will make it to Landmannalaugar.\
  \ Only 4x4s can traverse this terrain, via the long bumpy and winding F-roads that\
  \ lead into the heart of Iceland, and traffic is rare.\n\nBut we are lucky and soon\
  \ a super jeep full of young French men pulls in for us. This car is tightly packed\
  \ and I am the only person who doesn\u2019t speak French. There is no room for two\
  \ of us as well as our bags in the car but the men are insistent, and my friend,\
  \ a 37 year old Swiss man, has to sit on my lap. The sight of him hunched over is\
  \ a source of huge hilarity for everyone. \n\nThen we are going again, and deep\
  \ blue dusk is beginning to settle all around. Out of the window mountains emerge\
  \ and disappear behind layers of mist. We pick up speed. I laugh, sensing great\
  \ adventure.\n\nThe road from Hella into highland is long and winding and flat and\
  \ deep wild black. Red mountains push out of the earth. F-roads zigzag and weave\
  \ through space, and we follow. The landscape here is wild and black and alien,\
  \ a dark desert that extends forever, rising sometimes up into mountains and then\
  \ curling ancient lava.\n\nAs we traverse this new wild and alien territory, a dense\
  \ heavy mist rolls in and submerges everything. The mountains take on a new sensation,\
  \ of deep mist with shapes emerging. Ancient green lines run over everything like\
  \ tendrils coming out of coal. The air feels full of water and the colours are changed.\
  \ It feels darker, denser.\n\nWe drive past mountains like something ancient risen\
  \ from deep beneath the sea, pulled strangely into daylight. Their strange green\
  \ walls are zigzagged with scars, ancient wounds healed over like marks made two\
  \ thousand years ago. Shining glacial ice is revealed at times, pushing outwards\
  \ from beneath layers of shifting grey and green sand, revealing something of the\
  \ whiteness underneath.\n\nThe road leads us through green then blue, brown, and\
  \ grey. Strange black lava fields unravel, distorting space and time in their unearthly\
  \ hellish way. My imagination is caught by their sculptural black form, with holes\
  \ bored deep into the earth and points reaching wildly out.\n\nJust as night descends,\
  \ we arrive at the campsite to greet our waiting friends and their bottle of whiskey.\n\
  \nThe Brenninsteinsalda volcano greets me, its strange pink skin breathing steam\
  \ in the dark. Here is the primordial start of things, a land that remembers its\
  \ origins in volcanic fire."
