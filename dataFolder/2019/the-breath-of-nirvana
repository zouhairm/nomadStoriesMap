Text: "I may not have completed a yoga teacher training in India if it weren\u2019\
  t for stranger Katie Blair.\n\n\u201COm Bhuur-Bhuvah Svah, Tat-Savitur-Varennyam\u2014\
  STOP! I don\u2019t like this! It doesn\u2019t sound right. Why are we chanting this?\
  \ We don\u2019t even know what it means! I can\u2019t do it! Not again!\u201D  Her\
  \ anger subsided in a heartache she could not unravel. Sarah was the first to crack.\
  \ \n\nYears-old orange, pink, green, purple, and blue tattered yoga mats laid neatly\
  \ round the wood floor, held energy of various past students: struggle, introspection,\
  \ awareness, comfort, home. \n\n\u201CWhat is the biggest mistake of your life?\u201D\
  \ The first question in a series of many other invasive homework tasks assigned\
  \ by the philosophy teacher.\n\n\u201CCompulsively comparing my strength and intelligence\
  \ to everyone around me.\u201D I spoke out at my turn. The response surfaced from\
  \ uncharted, emotional soul-territory. I felt forced to dive beneath. \n\nYoga demands\
  \ diligence and self-control. Practice goes beyond the physical plane of flowing\
  \ through various postures to reach a healthy physique and balanced mind. We learn\
  \ that liberation, born from self-realization, emerges through acutely harmonizing\
  \ the mind and body and continually nurturing their symbiotic relationship. This\
  \ oneness of existence is referred to as a state of freedom, Nirvana. \n\n\u201C\
  What is the best thing you\u2019ve done in your life, and what is the worst thing\
  \ you\u2019ve done?\u201D Another question our teacher was not ready to respond\
  \ to the answers of. \n\nWe accepted the challenge with faint hearts, going into\
  \ yet another night of relentless mental and emotional loops. I laid in bed, contemplating\
  \ the teacher training process and whether I could persevere through another 20\
  \ days waking each day in near-freezing morning air and a bag ridden of newfound\
  \ weaknesses and regrets. Yet, there was something about those four, cold pastel-blue\
  \ walls, fluorescently lit, caging me in my room, that held a strange and unfamiliar\
  \ protective energy I grew fond of very quickly. \n\nWe finished the opening mantra\
  \ and answers to the question prevailed quickly and through tears that cleansed\
  \ the storms within. All nine of us began with what we felt was the worst thing\
  \ we had ever done.\n\n\u201CAfter firing five in my department, they forced me\
  \ to complete all the work while paying me the same salary. Sixteen hours behind\
  \ the computer screen six days a week. I don\u2019t want to live in China anymore\
  \ but I feel it\u2019s my duty. This makes me unhappy. And that\u2019s why I\u2019\
  m here, to fix my back, eyesight, and strengthen my immune system. I have never\
  \ even done yoga before.\u201D\n\n\u201CMy temper tantrums lead to the demise of\
  \ my parent\u2019s marriage and I haven\u2019t been able to find real love or feel\
  \ it since. But being with you women has helped me to feel something deep again.\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CMy mom remarried when I was young and her new partner had a son four\
  \ years older than me. One day when we were at the park alone he raped me. I was\
  \ about 10 years old. I had to live with him until I moved out at 18. She still\
  \ doesn\u2019t know.\u201D\n\n\u201CI couldn\u2019t find happiness within to support\
  \ the woman I was becoming. I couldn\u2019t accept anything about myself. And before\
  \ I knew it, I was standing on the railing of the biggest bridge outside of my home\
  \ town. I was going to do it. Taking my own seemed like the best option. \nNow I\
  \ know it would have been the worst.\u201D\n\nThere it was in plain sight. How observation\
  \ the mind and body could ultimately reunite us with past trauma, stored within\
  \ the energy channels, that unforgivingly blocked precious new insight from flowing\
  \ through our entire being, soul and spirit specifically. Together we found the\
  \ map and foraged a path to regaining our true and divine feminine power. \n\nThe\
  \ long hours of unadulterated meditation shifted the previous relationship with\
  \ pain and misery towards a newfound adoration and remembrance of a past that paved\
  \ the way for a bountiful harmony with oneself and the universe. \n\nThrough union\
  \ of mind and body, we discovered real love, true peace, demanding no conditions,\
  \ an unassailable love for thy self. A breath of Nirvana."
