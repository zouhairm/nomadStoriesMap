Text: "Well, here we are. I\u2019m trying to sneak out from the tent quietly, my roomie\
  \ is still snoring. I hardly slept at all last night. Not because of her really,\
  \ I\u2019d rather blame howling dogs and branches hitting the roof of our temporary\
  \ house. I\u2019m getting outside, stepping barefoot on the dewy grass. It\u2019\
  s early in the morning, the sun\u2019s barely up so the light is still cold, the\
  \ air even colder. I notice some movement in the second tent, which means the others\
  \ are awake, the night is over and we can pack our things and flee this spooky place.\
  \ Having spent the whole day on the road, we were tired and desperate for some rest.\
  \ Apparently we chose a very adequate spot \u2013 peaceful surroundings of a tiny\
  \ church and cemetery, hidden in some olive grove. I had my mind set on the idea\
  \ of a road trip through Tuscany since the very first day of my student exchange\
  \ in Italy. I never thought it was actually going to happen, but again \u2013 here\
  \ we are. \n\nThere\u2019s four of us and a few essentials: two tents, one car and\
  \ one moka. It\u2019s not only the Volkswagen that needs some fuel and coffee is\
  \ definitely the one for us. We\u2019re struggling with the tents and head towards\
  \ the car. The coffee pot is bubbling and hissing on a portable gas cooker as we\u2019\
  re gobbling down some apricots in the misty parking lot \u2013 that\u2019s our breakfast.\
  \ Then we\u2019re ready to go. The first stop is Volterra, all we want is to stroll\
  \ down the streets and soak up its italian charm. We\u2019re passing a stunning\
  \ building and decide to go inside. It seems empty, we spend a few minutes simply\
  \ gazing at painted ceilings, mesmerising patterned walls and chandeliers dripping\
  \ with crystals. Rays of daylight are shyly trying to break in but velvet curtains\
  \ are rather adamant. That, accompanied by a musky smell, makes us feel overwhelmed.\
  \ Just as we agree to get going, we hear a sound of shoes tapping on the marble\
  \ floor. Shortly after, an elegant elderly man approaches us. We start to chat in\
  \ broken italian and soon we find ourselves in the basement of the palazzo drinking\
  \ house wine, eating homemade cheese and hearing Gianfranco\u2019s captivating stories.\
  \ We leave with an invitation to his family home near lake Garda. Full with local\
  \ delicacies and full of appreciation for the local hospitality we continue our\
  \ journey and aim for Val d\u2019Orcia. We are passing endless sunflower meadows,\
  \ breathing in the warm air. There\u2019s this liberating, nostalgic feeling about\
  \ seeing blurry images through a car window, we decide to stop randomly where we\
  \ are. The view is breathtaking. Mellow hills covered with fields - vast and bathed\
  \ in the afternoon sun. Beauty of nature at its finest. We\u2019re moving forward\
  \ through the forest, the surroundings are astonishing and we decide to park the\
  \ car and explore. We\u2019re rewarded almost immediately, what emerges in front\
  \ of us are wild hot springs. There are few people, we manage to have a pool to\
  \ ourselves. Afraid of the dusk, we call it a day and reluctantly rush to the Volkswagen.\
  \ This time we choose a campsite for our shelter. Under the starry sky and without\
  \ an eerie neighbourhood we all sleep like babies. We\u2019re having our usual for\
  \ breakfast and go for a brief swim in the lake. Crisp air, sun glittering in the\
  \ clear water and three fisherman starting the day as early as us. We jump from\
  \ the wooden platform and feel alive. \n\nWe get back on the road and pass through\
  \ Siena, which welcomes us with a boiling heat wave and a marvelous main square.\
  \ A few hours later we\u2019re getting close to Sirmione, where our hosts \u2013\
  \ Gianfranco\u2019s sister\u2019s family \u2013 await us. We meet Chiara in the\
  \ town centre and then all squeeze into her car. She owns a vineyard, the fields\
  \ are the only thing that separates her house from lake Garda. The sun is setting,\
  \ last rays dancing on the roof tiles and grapevines. Our evening is magical, a\
  \ true italian feast. And for breakfast? A freshly baked cake and figs straight\
  \ from the garden. No apricots."
