Text: "The bus to Picton, New Zealand was an hour late when it plopped me outside\
  \ the Ferry terminal. The rain came down in sheets, smothering the sky in a blanket\
  \ of grey. \n\"I can check you in now if you want,\" said a woman behind the ticket\
  \ window.\nIn truth I wanted a bed, imagining my full-sized, ninja-turtle blanket\
  \ that sat untouched nine-thousand miles away. \nWhen the Ferry finally docked,\
  \ I made a beeline to the food court and found myself stuttering in an order to\
  \ the only cashier in sight. As soon as the words escaped my lips the man peering\
  \ out of the kitchen disappeared to get the food.\nThe wait for my dinner was filled\
  \ with the cashier\u2019s story about her mother who was from Michigan. In turn,\
  \ I shared that I was from Connecticut, having come to New Zealand to study. \n\"\
  I wonder if I know anyone in Connecticut,\" she mused. \nWhen the roast arrived,\
  \ I ate in the cafeteria greedily before grabbing my stuff and joining the sparse\
  \ collection of travelers in the passenger\u2019s lounge.\nI found my own bubble\
  \ of space and laid back to look at the ceiling. Part of me thought I would be in\
  \ awe over taking the Ferry alone, seeing how my first time was in the company of\
  \ my travel buddy, Hanna. \nWe had observed everything with excitement; the windows\
  \ foggy with grunge and the sound of parents trying to pacify their children with\
  \ bags of chips around us.\nTonight, however, the windows were pitch black and streaked\
  \ with water. There were no surrounding green mountains of the Marlborough Sounds.\
  \ No coastline with red rocks or white turbines half hidden in the mountain mist.\
  \ No Hanna. \nCurled up like a fetus, I found the Wi-Fi too slow to download the\
  \ Uber app. Only a few messages from my friend Hanna made it through. She had stayed\
  \ behind in Queenstown, choosing to stretch out our two-week break as long as possible.\
  \  \n\"Did you get home safe?\" \n\"Not yet. I won't get back till eleven-ish. Then\
  \ I've got to figure out how to get to The Cube.\" \n\"Don't worry, you'll figure\
  \ it out. Just call me before you end up sleeping under a bridge,\" she messaged.\
  \ \nI snickered, not sure what Hanna could do seventeen hours away by bus. With\
  \ luck there would be Wi-Fi at the terminal to call an Uber. \nI sighed and clicked\
  \ off my phone.\n\nWhen I was finally standing outside the terminal, watching the\
  \ last Ferry shuttle drive off, I quickly realized the position I had gotten myself\
  \ into. \n\u201CThat\u2019s the free shuttle.\u201D \nThe taxi driver pointed to\
  \ the front of the three-car line up outside the empty Ferry terminal. \u201COh.\
  \ No. There it goes.\u201D\nThe unmarked van drove off without so much as a sound,\
  \ leaving me without Wi-Fi or cash in my pocket.\nI had no one. No family standing\
  \ beside me, and my one New Zealand-made friend was on the other side of the country.\n\
  Breathe.\nI thanked the taxi driver and stepped away to buckle the hip band of my\
  \ hiking backpack. \n\u201CDo you have hotel here?\u201D asked the taxi driver.\n\
  He was middle aged, Asian, and had an accent that thickened his English. I shook\
  \ my head.\n\u201CI live at The Cube, a student accommodation in the city.\u201D\
  \n\u201COh,\u201D he said. \n\u201CI\u2019ll just walk,\u201D I said, fostering\
  \ an overly giddy smile. \nAs I geared to turn away the driver gestured to his van.\
  \ \n\u201CI\u2019ll drive you to the railway station. Free of charge,\u201D he said.\
  \ \n\u201CAre you sure?\u201D \nHe nodded, opening the door for me to climb in.\
  \ \n\u201CThank you so much,\u201D I gushed. \nThrough the darkness I could make\
  \ out the driver\u2019s ID tag. YUAN was printed in black letters above his picture.\
  \ We didn\u2019t speak, simply being two people in the same place at the same time,\
  \ our spheres of space merging into one for the briefest of moments. When Yuan dropped\
  \ me off our parting words were brief, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel utterly\
  \ grateful. I was alone again, but I was okay."
