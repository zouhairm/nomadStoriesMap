Text: "I was kid back at that time, curious and chivalrous.  Travelling at that time\
  \ particularly meant that I could board  on trains and fly of to my dream world.\
  \ However it  was different this time .\n         Rotang pass - \n      It was the\
  \ first ever time i saw snow. The love for snow was immense. The sun was not at\
  \ it best that day, but it was shinning like a million Crystals beautiful carved\
  \ out of the body of earth. Each spec was shining to it's glory and to me it was\
  \ a different place infact utopia itself. How long did I wish I was the queen of\
  \ snowland and ruled over the white bears and magnificent wolves. However,  the\
  \ day started growing dark , a storm was coming and i had left my snow shoes as\
  \ well as gloves back in car out of sheer excitement.  It was growing dark and I\
  \ seemed lost and alone . The wind started howling and I couldn't walk further in\
  \ the snow as my feet were freezing I was scared that I would never be able to see\
  \ my father my mother and my sister, they are my world. I tried finding a shelter\
  \ so that I could keep myself warm till the storm was gone but in vain I couldn't\
  \ find anything. I started to fall asleep, i couldn't feel my legs or my hands i\
  \ fell to the ground and prayed \"someone oh someone please save me\". It seemed\
  \ god answered my prayers,after i woke up in hospital my mum said that the rescue\
  \ team and a few locals had found me lying unconscious almost coverd with snow.\
  \ They had taken me to the hospital at the cost of their lives I couldn't have been\
  \ more thankful . Meeting those people had been a bliss , they had showered me with\
  \ gifts , unconditional love and a million memories and a life full of gratitude.\
  \ Till today when i get lost in the dreams of ruling the snowland I find those people\
  \ as my warriors my protectors.  I never found myself scared or shy infront of strangers\
  \ anymore, i feel I could get to know different stories, learn different lessons\
  \ and this incident had taught me to always cherish my loved ones no matter where\
  \ in the world I am .\nLOVE WILL THAW. \n                               - Queen\
  \ Elsa, Frozen, Disney."
