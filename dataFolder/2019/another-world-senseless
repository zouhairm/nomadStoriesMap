Text: "Some of us never traveled , only lived in the same city or town for some reasons\
  \ , I\u2019m one of them because I only stayed in the same city but when I grew\
  \ up like 14 years old my big brother who was working in another city surprised\
  \ us by a visit for a mall in Dubai to celebrate our holy days , we were happy like\
  \ fools because it\u2019s our first time to go to global mall in global city , when\
  \ we were ready to go my brother hold me up and turn me upside down , he was playing\
  \ kindly really but I got supper dizzy and barely could walk without falling down\
  \ , when we were in the road to Dubai I couldn\u2019t feel myself and even my body\
  \ , it\u2019s like I\u2019m drugged , the whole road till we reach the mall even\
  \ when we get in the mall , I couldn\u2019t indefine anything even the popular common\
  \ sense , I was lost somewhere I didn\u2019t know where , somehow my mind was off\
  \ , I was looking in one place and gaze for long time without thinking , I missed\
  \ the great thing there because I didn\u2019t feel anything , not even the tasty\
  \ food we ate there, to me that day never happened because it was like dream not\
  \ compared to real world , to be honest even dreams are more vivid than that day\
  \ , all that day I felt the same , nothing !  Like emotionless person with no reactions\
  \ , I was lost in  unknown space alone while people around me know nothing about\
  \ how I feel , that day ended after it I was supper happy for ending that miserable\
  \ day for good but after  more than couple years , I feel the same , senseless !\
  \ , for long time I\u2019m lost in the same unknown space , I\u2019m speechless\
  \ now , how to describe how this is so miserable to me , to feel nothing , to sense\
  \ nothing , nothing matter for me after I traveled to this unknown space , it\u2019\
  s like a dream I want to end to really sense every feeling my life traveling will\
  \ contain , whether it\u2019s joy or happiness or even pain , I want to feel awake\
  \ again , to feel that I\u2019m alive , not drugged and senseless , in every darkness\
  \ there\u2019s a light of hope in the end of the road , there\u2019s always a hope\
  \ in everything , giving up will never stop anything , life will continue while\
  \ you are in the same place , it\u2019s moving without you , my traveling in this\
  \ unknown space still on till I find that light of hope in the end of the road as\
  \ I always believe ."
