Text: "\u201CPhew! The last exam got over. Let\u2019s plan a trip.\u201D My friends\
  \ exclaimed.\nFlying to Dubai and going on a cruise to Hawaii was on everyone\u2019\
  s bucket list and why shouldn\u2019t it be? My friends wanted to go to an exotic\
  \ location; I wanted to go \u2018Desi.\u2019 They craved fancy places; I wanted\
  \ simplicity. Everyone wanted to travel far; I intended to explore a place close\
  \ to my heart.\nNo more suspense, I decided to visit \u2018Sherpur\u2019, a tiny\
  \ village in Jajpur district of Odisha. This was the land on which my father played\
  \ cricket as a child, my grandfather recited Sanskrit Shlokas, and my great grandfather\
  \ preached values, ethics, folklore and what not! So, this is the story of me going\
  \ back to my roots; to unleash who I was, to know where I actually came from and\
  \ where I belonged. This is the journey of me going home that I hadn't been to ever\
  \ before!\nBeing the daughter of an Army man, I've had the privilege of traveling\
  \ from the Himalayas of the North to the beaches of the South. Growing up in so\
  \ many places made me this perfect blend of cultures that I now represent. I had\
  \ been living in cities all my life; for once I wanted to be away and just breathe.\n\
  Without any second thoughts, I stuffed my college bag with food, water and a pair\
  \ of denims and hopped onto the next bus en route to Sherpur.  I went to my seat\
  \ only to find an old woman, in her late eighties sitting on my place. \u201CShe\
  \ took my window seat; I am going to be bored! Also, she\u2019ll soon fill the atmosphere\
  \ with loud snoring noise.\u201D infuriated, I took the seat next to her, plugged\
  \ in my earphones and started listening to the Imagine Dragons. \n\u201CWhere are\
  \ you traveling to?\u201D asked the lady.\n\u201CSherpur,\u201D I replied.\n\u201C\
  Then you must go to River Brahmani for fishing!\u201D she exclaimed.\n\u201CBrahmani\
  \ flows through the village?\u201D I enquired in Odia with a not-so-Odia accent.\n\
  Thus began our saga of conversation. Her ideologies about feminism, politics, Indian\
  \ culture, her favorite TV show \u2018Kaun Banega Crorepati\u2019 intrigued me.\
  \ After all, everyone is a storyteller; all you need to do is listen! \nI was enjoying\
  \ her amazing stories and munching on her yummy homemade cookies when the bus started\
  \ rolling downhill. We were in an isolated place called Gonasika in the middle of\
  \ the night, and the engines or the brakes had momentarily failed! I had come to\
  \ discover myself, not to die in a bus! Everyone panicked, and so did I. But there\
  \ she was, her hands folded into \u2018namaskar\u2019 posture, her eyes closed and\
  \ her lips chanting. I don\u2019t know if it was a mere coincidence or her prayers\
  \ were answered, but the driver got the control of the bus again. I was mesmerized.\
  \ I felt a connection I hadn\u2019t felt in a long time; I felt less foreign. She\
  \ smiled. I smiled back.\nIt was six in the morning when my alarm rang. She was\
  \ gone but had definitely carved an everlasting impact on me.\nI got down the bus\
  \ and walked through the lush green paddy fields straight to the home where my grandmother\
  \ lives. I had never seen a happier face!\nEating fruits right from the garden,\
  \ traditional Odia cuisine, and coconuts that a local had brought by skillfully\
  \ climbing up the tree left me in awe. Fetching water from the tubewell in the backyard,\
  \ praying at the Jagannath temple, feeding stray monkeys, fishing and swimming in\
  \ the river, watching the sunset at the horizon, doing yoga with the villagers,\
  \ milking the cows; all this was an experience of a lifetime! We put the cots out\
  \ in the terrace and slept under the blanket of a billion stars. I had never seen\
  \ the sky this divine. There was something in the air; it felt so magical that I\
  \ cannot put into words! \n\u201CIs this the real life or just fantasy?\u201D I\
  \ kept pondering how peaceful living such a simple life was. I had finally found\
  \ my niche. I was no longer a foreigner to my homeland. I got lost; only to find\
  \ myself!"
