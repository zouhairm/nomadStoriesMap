Text: "When my identical twin sister and I traveled to Oxford, we didn't expect to\
  \ learn more about ourselves than ever before. Having been twins for our entire\
  \ lives - 19 years and counting, to be more precise - we had traveled around the\
  \ world to London to study abroad with our University. There was an optional day\
  \ trip to Oxford that our teachers offered to take us on, so we decided - instead\
  \ of taking a weekend in a separate country as we had the weekend before - to explore\
  \ the wealth of knowledge and beauty that can be found around the university. \n\
  \nWhile looking around a small shop inside a church in Oxford, we happened upon\
  \ a display of bookmarks. It was against a stone wall in the corner, almost out\
  \ of reach and definitely not noticeable at first sight. Each bookmark had a name\
  \ on it, and then the meaning of that name. Per usual, there was no \"Meredith\"\
  \ hanging on the display. But there was one for Erin. It indicated that my sister's\
  \ name, when translated in Gaelic, actually means \"Warrior.\" That moment was very\
  \ weird for us because - after extensive research years prior for an origin project\
  \ for school - I had found out that the origin of the name \"Meredith,\" in Welsh,\
  \ was \"Warrior.\" \n\nThat evening, when we called our parents to tell them of\
  \ our travels, we asked them if they had looked up the meanings of our names before\
  \ choosing them. They had not. They had unknowingly chosen the same origin for the\
  \ names of both of their identical twin daughters. \n\nThe story gets a little more\
  \ odd. After returning to The States from our travels, I was discussing name origins\
  \ with my roommate. Though she went by \"Danny,\" her name was \"Karla.\" When I\
  \ looked that up, the male version of that name also means \"Warrior\" when translated\
  \ into German. My only other sibling's name is \"Ian Karl.\" So my parents accidentally\
  \ named all of their children the same thing, using variations from different countries.\n\
  \nThough my travels while studying abroad were all very gorgeous and eye-opening,\
  \ this was the one that still allows me to feel amazing about the mysteries of the\
  \ universe. It almost makes me believe in fate, which is something I have caught\
  \ magical glimpses of while sight-seeing and immersing myself in other cultures.\
  \ After all, who knew that an adventure to try and find the recreation center where\
  \ the twin duo The Proclaimers were performing in Scotland would actually lead us\
  \ to a strange family-friendly karaoke bar? Or that that same trip would lead us\
  \ to quoting \"Monty Python & The Holy Grail\" while trotting up to Doune Castle,\
  \ where it was filmed? And has anyone's father bragged as much as our dad did about\
  \ us drinking in an ice bar in London? \n\nMy travels have brought me some of the\
  \ best moments of my life. I desire nothing more than to continue opening my eyes\
  \ and the eyes of others to its beauty."
