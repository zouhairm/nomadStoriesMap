Text: "Fewer than six months ago my life changed. Through a series of very fortunate\
  \ events, i met up with a long lost friend. I was really in love with her six years\
  \ before, but we had broken it off after very little time, and we both had things\
  \ in our lives that made it so we had not seen each other, or even spoken for years\
  \ at a time. It was like an itch that was never scratched, and it really needed\
  \ scratching. I never knew that my feelings were requited, but low and behold, when\
  \ we did finally start talking again I felt bliss. I was told by her that it was\
  \ just a few days before we first talked (after 5 years of silence, that is) since\
  \ she realised she doesn\u2019t love me anymore. Just finding out that she had been,\
  \ just as I was, in love with me for all this time, even if she wasn\u2019t anymore,\
  \ made me think of all kind of crazy scenarios. But none as crazy as what actually\
  \ happened. In the 6 months that i previously mentioned, life took us through 6\
  \ countries, some more than once, and has landed us where we are now: Sao Paulo,\
  \ Brazil. I was living in the UK, she was living in France (this is the point where\
  \ I should mention that we\u2019re both from the same city in Romania, and that\
  \ we were first together during high school) and she got the opportunity to study\
  \ in Brazil for 6 months. Deciding that I was going to go with her was a surprisingly\
  \ easy decision, as I didn\u2019t even have to think before committing to what i\
  \ thought was basically just a 6 month vacation in a sunny place. Getting there\
  \ however was a different experience. We took the train from London to Paris. We\
  \ took a flight from Paris to Lisbon. In Lisbon, less than 10 minutes before check-in\
  \ closed, we found out that, because none of us had our visas sorted out, we needed\
  \ to get tickets out of Brazil before flying there. Massive crisis, obviously. On\
  \ a whim we bought some tickets to Buenos Aires (more on that later). 13 hours later,\
  \ we arrive in Sao Paulo. We take a taxi to our accommodation, and a few blocks\
  \ away from the house we were going to stay in we notice that even the street lights\
  \ are off. It was Carnival time, and that, combined with a massive storm meant that\
  \ the whole neighbourhood was having a blackout. Very tired, and not wanting to\
  \ do anything but sleep, we still decided to have a few drinks with our host, to\
  \ get to know them. Much was my surprise when I found out that the whole house was\
  \ actually an artistic collective. Me myself am an artist, a filmmaker and photographer,\
  \ and I was already thinking of ways we could collaborate.\nBut before any of that\
  \ could happen, we realised we needed our visas. This is where the flight to Buenos\
  \ Aires comes back into the story. You see, in Brazil you can\u2019t actually get\
  \ a visa while you\u2019re in the country, so you need to go out to do that. So\
  \ we went to Buenos Aires, and got the visa in record time, something we were told\
  \ by everyone we talked to is an impossible feat. \nNow we\u2019re back in Brazil,\
  \ and thanks to the very lucky happening of coming to a house where art just happens,\
  \ I am just getting my video gear ready for the first video shoot in Brazil, and\
  \ potentially many more amazing projects that I would never have gotten into, having\
  \ not followed this love to Brazil."
