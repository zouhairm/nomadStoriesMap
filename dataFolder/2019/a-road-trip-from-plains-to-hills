Text: "Road Trip is one of the wonderful aspect of travel as it let you to visit many\
  \ places in one single day and if the road trip is to Shimla then you tend to experience\
  \ the beauty of high mountains on the way. Me and my few friends grabbed such an\
  \ opportunity to experience this road trip and reconnect with the mountains in which\
  \ we are born and brought up. We commenced our journey from Chandigarh at 7:00 am.\
  \ Before entering the hills of Himachal we took short stops at places such as Pinjore\
  \ gardens, Kalka and entered the Himalayan Ranges at Parwanoo. Our next stop was\
  \ at Timber Trail resort from where we took the rope way to a beautiful resort on\
  \ hill top & returned on our way back to NH\nMoving ahead we reached Jabli, a small\
  \ town and had breakfast there. Our next stop was at Dharmpur from where we took\
  \ a turn and reached Kasauli a small town 12km from NH-22 which mesmerized us with\
  \ the beauty, it withholds in its simplicity. Reaching there we straightly headed\
  \ to a view that literally took our breaths away at Monkey Point, the place with\
  \ its own religious importance. Along with Monkey point we also visited lovers point,\
  \ sunset point where the air talks while whispering into your ears.\nMeanwhile when\
  \ we reached back Kasauli Mall road, it was already lunch time and so we treated\
  \ ourselves with delicious and the famous Momos of this place and took a short tour\
  \ of Chrits's church there. On returning back to NH we were leading our way towards\
  \ Solan. We took a brief stop at an ancient Shiv Temple to offer our prayers. Next\
  \ stop was Barog railway station. This place was built by Britishers and is a beautiful\
  \ example of skilled architecture. The famous barog tunnel is the longest tunnel\
  \ of Kalka- Shimla UNESCO heritage railway line. It has some haunting stories which\
  \ goes back narrating from the time of its construction.\nContinuing our journey\
  \ we reached the Mushroom city of India, \u201CSolan\u201D. Finding our way from\
  \ solan bypass we passed the railway crossing of Chambaghat where we saw the Himalayan\
  \ Queen moving on its rail tracks to Kalka. We saw the Mushroom centre of Chambaghat,\
  \ Mohan Meccan Brewery, world\u2019s oldest brewery, from where the gigantic Himalayas\
  \ started to welcome us. The cold breeze was giving us goose bumps. The beautiful\
  \ houses on the hill top were a treat to the eyes.\nThe Road then led us to another\
  \ gorgeous town of Kandhaghat where we stopped to buy the very famous sweets of\
  \ a shop named Laxmi jee\u2019s. Coming back on road our eyes could not get enough\
  \ of the scenery and brain confused on which side to see as all was so marvelous.\
  \ Our eyes got stuck on the gorgeous resort of Club Mahindra. We passed by the town\
  \ of Shoghi and from where we bowed to the muystical temple at the mountain top\
  \ Of Goddess Tara Devi.\nIn between we passed many small towns and also the toy\
  \ train showed them to us at small openings and returning back into their route\
  \ between the mountains. A number of small temple standing erect on each curve,\
  \ truly well defining the reason of Himachal being called the Devbhoomi (the land\
  \ of Gods).\nLost in this beauty we didn\u2019t realize that we were entering our\
  \ destination Shimla. It was almost dawn and we ought to stop at Sankat mochan temple\
  \ dedicated to Lord Hanuman. The simple decors of the temple wanted us to stay more.\
  \ We watched the sunset from its roof top. Watching the sun hiding itself into the\
  \ mountains and stars waking up in the sky and also the lights of the houses on\
  \ mountains was nothing but magical and making it seemed the stars on the mountains.\
  \ We could see almost entire city with a little glimpse of the statue of Lord Hanuman\
  \ between the hills.\nOur journey ended when we reached The Shimla Mall Road which\
  \ was all lighted up with the shops there, crowded with the people who came to experience\
  \ the peace which was in that place."
