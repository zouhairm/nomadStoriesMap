Text: "I\u2019ve read about arranged marriages, but I never thought I would meet somebody\
  \ who was in one \u2013 let alone a woman who was once a 5-year-old bride. \n\n\
  I held on tight as the old car fought with the bumpy road. A gap in the concrete\
  \ barrier gaped at us, where a large vehicle had broken through it and fallen over\
  \ the edge. Thin metal wires poked out from its edges, untouched since the accident.\
  \ Rocks crunched under our tyres as the driver guided us along one of Nepal\u2019\
  s most dangerous roads, leaving Kathmandu for the south. \n\nThe jagged silhouette\
  \ of the Himalaya mountains lay behind me as I farewelled the cool air of high altitude\
  \ and headed towards the flat, luscious national park of Chitwan. Dust filled my\
  \ lungs at every breath. Scooters zoomed past us and intoxicating swirls of incense\
  \ seeped in through the window. Notorious as one of Nepal\u2019s most fatal roads,\
  \ it took 10 hours to arrive at our destination only 170 kilometres away. The shattered\
  \ side mirror of the car reflected a fragmented image. Dark circles sat under my\
  \ eyes; dust in every pore.  \n\nA country so frequently devastated by natural disasters\
  \ takes its toll on weary travellers. But the trip would be worth it to finally\
  \ meet Kharika.  \n\nNepal had made headlines in 2015 when a 7.8 magnitude earthquake\
  \ took almost 9,000 lives. Only two years on, severe flooding affected over 100,000\
  \ people in the nation\u2019s south. Farmers lost crops; families lost homes. But\
  \ as I got out of the car, the yellow grass and cracked soil showed no evidence\
  \ of abundant water. Mud brick homes lay crumbled whilst makeshift huts stood erect\
  \ as a silent reminder of prior events. The floods had killed more than 70 people\
  \ and destroyed thousands of homes.  \n\nAt dusk, I arrived at a small, blue house\
  \ with a water pump in the front. Kharika\u2019s son welcomed me with flower necklaces\
  \ and silky scarves \u2013 and a steamy hot plate of Dhal Bat \u2013 traditional\
  \ Nepalese curry without meat. I was anxious to meet his mother who lived next door\
  \ \u2013 the woman I had travelled so far to meet.  \n\nEarly the next morning I\
  \ knocked on her wooden door. It opened a crack to reveal a small, dark home. Kharika\
  \ called out in Nepalese and slowly shuffled to the door. \n\nBent over with age,\
  \ the 95-year-old looked up at me and smiled. She embraced my hands in hers. Her\
  \ hands and feet were deeply cracked like the dirt floor inside her home. I admired\
  \ her golden anklets that jingled as she lead me to sit on a crate at the front\
  \ door. Only months earlier I had read her biography, and now I was here. \n\nKharika\
  \ had been someone\u2019s bride at just 5 years of age. Born in the 1920s in rural\
  \ Nepal, she was sold off to be married due to her family\u2019s extreme poverty.\
  \ She went on to have 12 children. Throughout her life, she endured physical and\
  \ emotional abuse \u2013 for being a woman, for giving birth only to girls and for\
  \ defying laws at the time preventing females from owning land. She fought for her\
  \ girls to be educated and equal. Locals threw rocks at her for not giving birth\
  \ to any boys. She was still having babies in her 40s, which was the life expectancy\
  \ of females at that time.  \n\nWithout a word of English, I felt welcome in her\
  \ home. Kharika gestured for me to take a photo of us. I moved next to her while\
  \ her son explained that his mother had always preferred to live a simple life.\
  \ She had never owned a mirror. She hadn\u2019t seen her own reflection in a long\
  \ time. \n\nI showed her the photo of us. Looking from Kharika\u2019s face to the\
  \ photo, I noticed the wrinkles on her small face and the grey hair reflecting boldly\
  \ in the picture.  \n\nShe studied the photo and gingerly ran her finger over the\
  \ image of her aging skin; her toothless smile and silvery hair. The corners of\
  \ her mouth rose slowly and her eyes widened. She whispered something. Her son smiled\
  \ and translated her words. \n\n\u201CWow!\u201D She grinned. \u201CI look fantastic!\u201D"
