Text: "The intense heat of La Guaira welcomes me right at the plane\u2019s door. I\
  \ cherish it. People who can\u2019t stand hot weather didn\u2019t grow up here;\
  \ they don\u2019t know heat is life and plenty, even if plenty also brings unpleasant\
  \ things with it.\n\nI swim through Customs and its intimidating question storm:\
  \ stopover; 12 hours; no luggage; no dollars. I wear back the protective vest I\
  \ took off years ago while crossing the exit: confident pace, sharp eye, quick reflexes.\n\
  \nI go straight to the black cabs with solid-color windows and the sole crest that\
  \ conveys a sense of safety, even if it\u2019s also a warning flag on a dollar mine.\
  \ Dollars again. A woman drives.\n\nShe announces the details of the journey on\
  \ the radio. Out of the airport, I drink the sea in through my eyes, and bounce\
  \ my head on the window while we curve towards the highway.\n\n\u201CWould you mind\
  \ driving a little longer along the coast? It has been so long since the last time\u2026\
  \u201D She glances at me on the rear mirror, with tender eyes and knowing smile,\
  \ but her fears answer. I understand.\n\nWe talk about me living away, yet never\
  \ leaving; her wanting to leave, too, but having no means. She warns me everything\
  \ has changed so much. I know that, but I also know I\u2019ll be impressed anyway.\
  \ Making the most of the proximity, I jump into the front seat.\n\n\u201CIs it still\
  \ possible to go up by El \xC1vila?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, but not with us.\u201D\n\
  \nI talk her into taking me to the Jeeps that go up the mountain; I need to see\
  \ Caracas beautiful again before I re-meet it.\n\n\u201CGood luck, chama\u201D.\
  \ We kiss and hug with the companionship good Venezuelans have been knitting between\
  \ them over these years.\n\nMy lungs are not enough to breath the jungle. I lay\
  \ my head back and see the world pass by: the sun sneaking through gigantic leaves.\n\
  \nI make it to the top of the mountain and eat a cachapa while looking at the Humboldt\
  \ hotel, closed down and half demolished, with that giant flag, torn and discolored,\
  \ fluttering in front of it. Graphic synthesis. A country.\n\nI go down by funicular.\
  \ Caracas crackles under the tropic\u2019s sun. On the final stretch, when the cabin\
  \ seems to speed up, ready to plunge into the station, I recognize my city, despite\
  \ its deformed bones and swollen belly.\n\nThe place where I learned about life\
  \ and literature is pretty close. I take a cab with a pinch of mistrust. At Venezuela\
  \ square, the clock is blank; time here can\u2019t be measured with clocks anymore.\
  \ A postcard. A country.\n\nThe cab can\u2019t go in, the sole security guard \u2013\
  \ in a uniform that once fitted \u2013 tells us. There\u2019s a strike, the university\
  \ is dangerous, but I can\u2019t leave without visiting.\n\n\u201CDo you want me\
  \ to wait for you, child?\u201D \u201CAy, se\xF1or, but drive around, don\u2019\
  t wait here. I\u2019ll pay you now, just in case.\u201D \u201CLet\u2019s meet in\
  \ 30 minutes.\u201D\nI push anguish down my pocket. All the happy hours laying on\
  \ that grass, now dried, overcome. The UCV makes me a gift: blue macaws, and their\
  \ concert, ploughing through the golden sky.\n\nI whisper \u201Cthank you\u201D\
  , and run away from fear to the surveillance booth. The driver never moved.\n\u201C\
  Se\xF1or, would you take me to the beach?\u201D\n\nIn former times it would have\
  \ been impossible to get anywhere at 6:00 p.m., but this is a ghost city now. At\
  \ the seashore, the driver warns me to stay in the car.\n\nI remember I fell in\
  \ love with the sea on a weekday, when my mom took me really early to La Guaira\
  \ and we saw the sunrise.\n\nI roll my window down. The air is saturated with hot\
  \ saltpeter, sun\u2019s magic powder to disappear from the scenery. I inhale, trying\
  \ to hold the feeling. With the last sun rays going through my lashes, I close my\
  \ eyes.\n\nI open them back to a gotel\xE9 ceiling in a sealess city. I stand up\
  \ from bed, tired, and embed my head back into the desk with the map I study every\
  \ day, in the attempt to go home."
