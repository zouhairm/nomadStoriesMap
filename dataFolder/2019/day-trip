Text: "I love walking. It has always been how I prefer to meet a place. Flying becomes\
  \ an odd form of time travel which leaves a passenger just a little dazed. Though\
  \ much slower, cars and rails confine a person to a grid without much opportunity\
  \ to go off script. However, trusting our feet generally allows for small details\
  \ to come together as we gauge the character of the streets, buildings, people,\
  \ air...the actual life of a place new to our individual understanding of a timeline\
  \ we share with so many strangers. Seattle is good for such a walk.\n\nI had touched\
  \ down at SeaTac without a clue as to where I was supposed to go next but it wasn't\
  \ just the flight which had left me in a state. Hours earlier I had been in Chicago\
  \ for a quick day trip by bus from Louisville, KY...Seattle had not been any part\
  \ of my plan for the day when I left home that morning. Yet I had taken this trip\
  \ specifically for a coffee crawl so when I noticed a message through Instagram\
  \ from a publication notifying me of a sponsored pass to an industry event the next\
  \ day, in Seattle, I jumped! It took just twenty minutes to reach the airport from\
  \ the table holding my croissant and what must have been my fourth double shot of\
  \ the day, but the caffeine had little to do with my momentum. In transit I called\
  \ my boss, found a surprisingly cheap roundtrip flight, booked a room somewhere\
  \ I had never heard of, registered for attendance, and concealed to strangers a\
  \ long lost excitement for how terrifyingly easy the decision was to make without\
  \ regard to need for preparation, sleep, or that commitment to return to work by\
  \ 7am Eastern on Sunday.\n\nIt was approximately 5pm on Friday when my feet met\
  \ western soil. I moved toward the expo with a hope of finding distraction but it\
  \ didn't open until Saturday morning and nothing was happening there to keep me.\
  \ With a traveled yawn I looked from the closed entrance to my phone for an idea\
  \ of coffee and walked into the first shop on the map which caught my attention.\
  \ It was there that I noticed a group of coffee nerds playing board games and from\
  \ that one interaction I gained access to a network of so many I had previously\
  \ only carried a simple impression of through their social media. They introduced\
  \ me to still more people I didn't know of and to so many places I should know of\
  \ while the night went on until everyone was ready to retire for an anticipation\
  \ of the reason they had come. \n\nWhen we said our goodbyes they headed to their\
  \ lodgings but I continued to walk. It's what I love and the expo itself was not\
  \ why I had come. I wandered from their goodbyes to a storied spot - to coffee shops\
  \ with reputation - to places I had seen in pictures - to places I had no idea of\
  \ - never to the place I was supposed to sleep for the night. I walked to all these\
  \ places just so I could get to know them. I learned their character and their faces\
  \ and the weight of what this place on a map had to offer someone who wasn't looking\
  \ for it just hours before. \n\nSeattle offered me what I assume most places make\
  \ available to any new traveler: the opportunity to press pause on the idea we have\
  \ of who we are so we might test that self image in a place we expect nothing of,\
  \ where it likewise expects nothing of us. It's there we find ourselves responding\
  \ to questions with real thought rather than automation because we have made time\
  \ to think freely in a new space rather than submit to routines of the same old,\
  \ the peer expectation(s) which come with our usual surrounding.\n\nI stepped off\
  \ a bus in Louisville, KY at 7:20am Eastern on Sunday. I was tired, somewhat late,\
  \ and in a lot of trouble with my boss. Yet without a change in plans I wouldn't\
  \ have learned anything."
