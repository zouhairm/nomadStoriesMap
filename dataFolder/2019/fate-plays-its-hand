Text: "I'd just taken the first sip of a strong black when I heard her voice. \u2018\
  Hello mister. What are you doing here?\u2019 I looked up. She was crossing the road\
  \ towards me, small, dark, pretty with a mass of frizzy black hair. \u2018I could\
  \ ask you the same question, sis. You don't look like a local.\u2019\n\nShe sat\
  \ down. \u2018I asked first.\u2019 She eyed my motorbike. \u2018Where you heading?\u2019\
  \n\n\u2018I'm heading for Lombok. And you? From Flores?\u201D\n\n\u2018Same hair,\
  \ but no, I'm from Timor Leste.\u2019\n\n\u2018So how come you washed up here?\u2019\
  \n\nSitting on a bench beside a dusty road in east Sumbawa, an amazing tale was\
  \ about to unfold. Nia was just two when the Indonesians invaded. Her father was\
  \ a member of the Independence movement.\n\nA guerrilla war began. The population\
  \ took to the hills. Outgunned, the situation turned from difficult to dire. Starvation\
  \ stalked the land. There was no choice but to send the women and children back\
  \ to the towns.\n\nA couple of years later news filtered back that Nia\u2019s father\
  \ had been killed. After some time, as was the custom, Nia's uncle assumed responsibility\
  \ for the family and married his widowed sister-in-law. Time passed and two children\
  \ were born. Then, when Nia was 15 the Indonesians paid a visit to tell them her\
  \ Dad was alive and was in prison in Dili!\n\nThe Indonesians demanded to see Nia's\
  \ arm. She'd been wounded by shrapnel as a child. Her Dad had told them about it\
  \ when they had demanded some sign to ensure they had located the right family.\n\
  \nAnd so the re-union took place in a bare room watched over by guards. \u2018Bitter\
  \ sweet? There are no words to describe it\u2019, said Nia. \u2018I was meeting\
  \ a man who had existed only in my dreams. And now this! His wife married to his\
  \ brother. And they had two kids!\u2019\n\nStoically, her father accepted the reality\
  \ that war had dropped in their laps. There was nothing to be done. But he had one\
  \ request. He was to be exiled to Sumbawa. He wanted to take Nia. It was agreed\
  \ she should go. So here she was sitting by the roadside, sharing coffee with a\
  \ wandering motorcyclist.\n\nShe was 31, married and had a little boy. She hadn't\
  \ seen her Mum for 16 years. She longed to see her, to hug her. After Independence\
  \ her Dad returned  but she had ties. \u2018One day,\u2019 she sighed.\n\nHer story\
  \ touched me. Memories flooded back: my mother sitting at the table, opening the\
  \ letter bearing the news of her sister's premature death in a place half a world\
  \ away. Me, holding my Mum's hand as she took her last breath at 4.00am on a cold\
  \ winter's morning.\n\nNia's life had been tough. She\u2019d worked in Malaysia.\
  \ She'd sent all the money home and now it was gone. Her husband's family had been\
  \ good until the money had dried up. Now, she was treated with indifference. \"\
  Maybe if I became Muslim things would be different, but I'm a Catholic. Full stop.\"\
  \n\nI determined that I would do something for her. I told her that I would see\
  \ her again in a few months. I don't know if she believed me.\n\nMonths passed.\
  \ I went to India. While there I bought a cloth purse. When I met up with Nia again\
  \ it was in my pocket bulging with a fat wad of Rupiah. She was happy to see me.\
  \ Her husband was there too. He eyed me suspiciously. I told Nia I wanted to speak\
  \ to her \u2013 alone. She put the kettle on and asked her husband to go and buy\
  \ a packet of biscuits \u2018for our guest.\u2019\n\nAs soon as he left I pressed\
  \ the purse into Nia's hand. \u2018Take this. It's more than enough money to get\
  \ you home to see your Mother.\u2019 She slipped the purse inside her shirt and\
  \ squeezed my hand.\n\nNine months later and I was back in Australia. The phone\
  \ rang. It was 3am. It was Nia. \u2018I'm back in Timor. I'm with my Mother. You\
  \ have no idea how happy I am!\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, I do,\u2019 I said. \u2018I can\
  \ hear it in your voice.\u2019"
