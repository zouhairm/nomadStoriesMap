Text: "As I sit at road side cafe waiting for my train in Claremont Ferrand I cannot\
  \ help but wonder what led me to this place in time. Deep within my own thoughts\
  \ I feel a tap on my shoulder; it\u2019s a Turkish gentleman with an extended arm\
  \ offering a glass of wine. I smile and accept, we sit in silence and soak up the\
  \ last of the sun and then gather our luggage and head our separate ways. It is\
  \ in this moment that everything is as plain as day. \n\nI came to France in search\
  \ of love and the one I thought I loved. Instead of falling head over heals for\
  \ a person, I have awoken a flame inside of me that cannot be distinguished. I may\
  \ be alone now but I do not feel empty or lonely. I am surrounded by these new sites\
  \ with so much history and culture that cannot be soaked up in one afternoon.  I\
  \ decide to not take this train to the airport which would ultimately lead me home\
  \ but to embark upon a different journey. The direction I am headed now is to Paris,\
  \ to the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Notre Dame, to breathe in as much of the city\
  \ as I possibly can. I am a little nervous of the unknown but I am going to push\
  \ myself out of my comfort zone. I am further confident that I can do this when\
  \ I think about home. Coming from a small town in Muskoka where tourism is a bustling\
  \ industry, I am used to catering on the tourists not being one. I look out the\
  \ train window and see the lights of the city now drawing me in, filling me with\
  \ excitement. Solo as I am now, one foot on the threshold, I pause and take a breath.\
  \ Stepping out into the fresh air, I let the crowd take me away and I think; I am\
  \ the tourist now and this is my new found passion. My journey starts here."
