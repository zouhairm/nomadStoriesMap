Text: "Every year since graduating high school I have had the feeling that this will\
  \ be \u201Cmy year\u201D \u2013 the one where big things are going to happen \u2013\
  \ true love, career advancement, win the lottery, settle down (you know, the typical\
  \ American Dream type of stuff). In January 2017, I did not have that feeling. I\
  \ was coming to the end of another unhealthy relationship that I was trying too\
  \ hard to cling to and fix. I had an epiphany that once again I\u2019d made a real\
  \ mess of things \u2013 I realized I had left my hometown, family and stable job\
  \ behind 7 months previous to move in with a guy 100 miles away from anyone I knew\
  \ - and it had failed.\n\nYou can imagine how painful the blow was to my ego when\
  \ I started admitting how unhappy I had become. As friends were announcing major\
  \ milestones in life and we were quickly approaching our 10 year highschool reunion\
  \ \u2013 I realized I don\u2019t have that much to share. I had not gone on to complete\
  \ a masters or PHD program, I had not traveled outside of the US, I had not been\
  \ married nor had any children, I did not own a home, I took a step back in my career\
  \ to start over fresh at a new company, I had moved to county where I had no friends\
  \ or family for an unhealthy, failing relationship \u2013 the 2007 version of \u201C\
  where I wanted to be in 10 years\u201D looked COMPLETELY different than the life\
  \ I led in 2017.\n\nOver the last 10 or 15 years of my life I have had to start\
  \ over, recreate and reinvent myself so the idea of beginning again was simple to\
  \ grasp, but I wasn\u2019t sure where to go.  My debt vs asset ratio was depressing\
  \ and interest rates were eating me alive. My childhood friend Devon invited me\
  \ to join her on her trip in June to Iceland. I was still living with my ex, even\
  \ though we weren\u2019t \u201Ctogether\" anymore,  so I ran the idea by him. Once\
  \ I bought the ticket to Iceland, this trip became a topic of contention which brought\
  \ my relationship to a firm end. Buying that ticket was the best decision I have\
  \ ever made.\n\nWithin a few weeks of purchasing the ticket I moved to sunny Capistrano\
  \ Beach about a half a mile from the OC coastline. I had finally done something\
  \ for myself and on my own! Several weeks later, I embarked on my first international\
  \ journey and fell in love with natural wonders, culture, art and the diversity\
  \ that life outside of the United States offered. 10 days later I came back to the\
  \ states and my sunny little beach town to return to the only thing that I felt\
  \ was going well for me in the world: work.\n\nA few months later, my manager offered\
  \ me a role in our London office. Several weeks later, I boarded a plane with just\
  \ two bags and relocated to London. September 22nd, 2017 I landed at Gatwick with\
  \ directions to my flat. Over the next few months, I had no clue how often I would\
  \ feel alone, stressed and confused\u2026 but that is where the real growth came\
  \ through, because pain is the touchstone of spiritual growth.\n\nI learned that\
  \ I actually like traveling alone. I had always thought having someone to be with\
  \ would make traveling better, but in actuality it is much better to travel alone\
  \ than in bad company. When I\u2019m alone, I can stack up a voracious itinerary\
  \ and push through a day without considering what the other person would like to\
  \ do, eat or see. So far, I\u2019ve been able to see a lot of European cities over\
  \ my weekends during my UK work assignment. Sure, I\u2019d sometimes love someone\
  \ to share the moments and memories with, but I\u2019ve been able to spend time\
  \ meditating in solitude in beautiful places and have been more mindful of people\
  \ and culture around me. I\u2019ve made friends everywhere I\u2019ve gone and continued\
  \ to say yes to trying new things. Every opportunity is available to me. The only\
  \ things holding me back are time and money."
