Text: "My Albania, Home Away from Home\n\nMy heart truly aches for this country and\
  \ the people there. \_I'm not sad...there's a difference...I just ache. \_I think\
  \ about the wonderful moments with old and new friends alike.  I think about their\
  \ eyes...I miss looking into their eyes each day. \_I think about their hands...I\
  \ miss holding their hands each day.\n\nIt had been four years since I had been\
  \ there last and while I've kept many friendships current through social media,\
  \ life had still changed for all of us. \_I wondered if I would feel the same way\
  \ that I did the last time I was there. \_God has used Albania to bring strength\
  \ and wholeness to my life. \_He has used my leaps of faith to bring me near to\
  \ His heart, within reach of hearing His voice clearly with each prayer. \_\n\n\
  This trip was crucial for me. \_It was beautiful in the sense that I saw so many\
  \ old friends and we spent time laughing and loving each other. \_It was intense\
  \ each day filled with moments trusting so deeply to follow.  It confirmed so many\
  \ things for me.\n\nI believe that God prepares the way for us to walk in. \_He\
  \ lights each step as we need to take it. \_He takes us from one faith-filled journey\
  \ onto another as we complete the last mile of the course. I know God has called\
  \ me to this field. \_\n\nFor so many, Albania is just a small country on the map.\
  \ \_It's within knowing and understanding their history that you really begin to\
  \ get to know and understand the people that call this beautiful place their home.\
  \ \_It's a country with such an incredible depth of culture, pride, and heart. \_\
  They have only had religious freedoms since 1992. \_They are warm and sincere. \_\
  They are so full of charm. \_They are gentle and yet fearless. \_They work hard\
  \ and they love intensely. \_There is struggle. \_The landscape is majestic and\
  \ magnificent. \_The people are full of grace. \_The city is full of small businesses.\
  \ \_They shop only for a day or two worth of groceries at a time. \_They walk everywhere.\
  \ \n\_\nI want you to be able to close your eyes and smell the bread baking and\
  \ picture the farm fresh fruits and vegetables that are being sold on the streets.\
  \ \_I want you to be able to hear the bells around the goats and the sheep as they\
  \ walk down the streets following their shepherd. \_The simplicity of their livelihood\
  \ and the innocence of their everyday even in the hustle and bustle of the capital\
  \ city. \_Look into their worn faces and hold their delicate hands. \_Now, feel\
  \ the strength that is inside of them and see how hungry their hearts are to find\
  \ purpose. \n\nI miss holding their hands and greeting them on the streets. \_I\
  \ miss looking deep within their eyes and touching their hearts with acts of kindness.\
  \ \_\n\nAlbania will always be my home away from home because every person I have\
  \ ever met there has become family.  The small country full of great hearts.  You\u2019\
  ve got to see it and experience the life that it will give you for yourself.  Go\
  \ ahead, search for the flight that will bring you home to a land you barely knew\
  \ but are head over heels in love with."
