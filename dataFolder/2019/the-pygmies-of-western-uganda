Text: "Often times I used to sit on my study table and ask myself what is my positive\
  \ role in this world and where is the actual scene which I can play the role. And\
  \ I surveyed my conditions as a son of a peasant and find out am in a group of circles\
  \ which should be the theatre of my activities so I should try to move as much as\
  \ possible. So I set out on my first trip to a troubled nation which I had learnt\
  \ from my History class-Rwanda. The country was healing from the genocide they faced\
  \ earlier in 1994.\nSo I set out after planning for a month for the trip, being\
  \ my first time to a foreign country. I left Kenya by bus to Kampala Uganda considering\
  \ I did not have enough to pay for a plane ticket. I reached Kampala Uganda an for\
  \ the first time I had the traditional matoke meal as I waited to board the next\
  \ bus to Kigali Rwanda. Evening came and I was seated in the bus to Rwanda anxious\
  \ for the adventure that lied ahead. So I quickly fell into deep sleep when the\
  \ bus took off for the journey, and was woken up by a big bang the next morning\
  \ when the bus I was on board collided with another vehicle and came to a stop near\
  \ a town called Kabale. \nIt was an unexpected accident and sadly one person lost\
  \ his life, and several were injured but I was lucky I came out perfectly fine which\
  \ the medics confirmed after check up in a local hospital in kabale. Stopping at\
  \ this small time called Kabale was by accident as it wasn't my intended stop but\
  \ actually this was the day I learnt that the most challenging moments in life are\
  \ actually our greatest opportunities to learn and grow as a person.\nSo I set out\
  \ of the hospital to go and get a quick means to the border of Rwanda and uganda\
  \ as the town isn't far from the border. But I met a very gentle person who was\
  \ interested to guide me considering I was new to the town. And while taking me\
  \ to board a vehicle he mentioned different interesting things about the town. And\
  \ what caught my attention deeply was when he mentioned a nearby village which is\
  \ inhibited by the pygmy community and is next to an awesome Lake called Bunyonyi.\
  \ My whole interest was diverted from visiting Rwanda to visiting this village.\
  \ So I asked him to take me to this village. And was welcomed by cultural dances\
  \ from the Batwa (pygmy) community who were celebrating a ln iniciation ceremony.\
  \ The cultural diversity of this people caught my attention I had never seen anything\
  \ like this before; a strange looking people, very short with a very primitive way\
  \ of life. \nThe Batwa are the oldest surviving tribe in Africa, who are originally\
  \ hunters and gatherers and they live in the forest around the Lake Bunyonyi. They\
  \ coexist with monkeys and other forest animals in harmony unlike other human beings.\
  \ They are a unique people as they do not destruct the environment but live just\
  \ deep in the forest together with mountain gorillas and chimpanzees. What an unexpected\
  \ experience I had interacting with this people. They live in adverse poverty but\
  \ they enjoy every bit of their lives with no interest in education or formal ways\
  \ of life. I got to share a part of their culture that day, dancing to their tune\
  \ of traditional songs, and having my first hunting session with s Batwa elder.\
  \ I experienced a purely natural life for the first time of my life and had a traditionally\
  \ cooked meal of roasted wild rabbit meat. This experience changed my life as i\
  \ vowed to set out to be a normad and experience cultural diversity of different\
  \ people to learn and experience a moment in a different culture every day of my\
  \ life. \nI ended up spending a week in Kabale experiencing this interesting culture\
  \ and writing about their traditional heritage which is based in peaceful and natural\
  \ coexistance with the environment. Experience of a lifetime."
