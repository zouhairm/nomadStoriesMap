Text: "Memories of the majestic marble mountains come flooding into my mind as I gaze\
  \ at them through the window of the taxi. I\u2019m returning to Da Nang with my\
  \ mum and my sister after two adventurous nights in Hoi An. The afternoon light\
  \ casts an orange tinge across the ocean to my right and into the atmosphere of\
  \ the seaside city; matching my washed-out mood. With just one full day left in\
  \ Vietnam before returning home, I can\u2019t help but wonder, \u2018what more is\
  \ there to do?\u2019\n\nAfter much deliberation, my mum finally agrees to hire a\
  \ scooter with her two enthusiastic daughters. \u2018It\u2019ll be fine mum\u2019\
  , we say, \u2018you\u2019ll love it!\u2019 So off we go, into the chaos of the Vietnamese\
  \ streets, wearing our dodgy baseball-cap helmets, on a scooter each. I take the\
  \ lead, beeping my way across the intersections, determined to reach the seaside\
  \ thoroughfare that will take us up, and into the hills of Da Nang\u2019s coastal\
  \ nook. \n\n\nIt\u2019s a pleasant ride. The sandy beach on our right is scattered\
  \ with the round, bamboo basket boats known as thung chai; watched over by the giant\
  \ Lady Budda, perched on the hill of the headland in the distance. Excitement wells\
  \ up inside of me as we begin the climb that will take us past the sacred landmark\
  \ of which we saw days earlier. Today is a day for exploration, and I\u2019m hoping\
  \ to find a very special Banyan tree that is supposed to reside somewhere in these\
  \ hills. An ancient tree that is sacred in its own natural wonder, at an estimated\
  \ 800 years of age. \n\nAs we leave the city views behind us, rounding the first\
  \ bend of the cape, there are forsted peeks towering before us.  The beautifully\
  \ blue ocean washes onto the beaches down below. It truly is breathtaking. The feeling\
  \ of vastness brings the realisation that we are going to need more petrol! Thankfully\
  \ a local see us as we stop to check the fuel tanks. He indicates with his actions\
  \ that he can get us petrol, so we follow him back to the roadside rest stop, sat\
  \ on the edge of the escarpment.  Much to our amusement we are each given two litres\
  \ of petrol, stored in old plastic drink bottles. It mightn\u2019t be conventional,\
  \ but it does the trick, and we\u2019re swiftly back on the jungle trail again.\
  \ \n\n\nWhat starts as a winding road quickly becomes more of a concrete path. We\
  \ catch the occasional glimpse of macaques scrambling off the road and disappearing\
  \ in the curtains of the morning glory vine.  At this point I wasn\u2019t expecting\
  \ to see any signage, let alone the clear sign at the fork in the road saying \u2018\
  Ficus tree\u2019. I\u2019m ecstatic, that\u2019s got to be the giant Banyan!  With\
  \ a right turn and a swift drift down hill, we find ourselves in the presence of\
  \ the ancient fig tree. It\u2019s hard to take it in all at once. As an aerial rooting\
  \ tree, it is a maze to look at. It\u2019s sprawling branches are held high by large\
  \ twisting trunks, with a centre piece that entwines on itself like a basket woven\
  \ by hand. We spend the better part of an hour resting in it\u2019s shade by the\
  \ sea, imagining all those before us to have taken refuge here. \n \n\nWith the\
  \ three of us feeling humbled and rejuvenated, we decide to continue our journey\
  \ into the unknown.  The further into the hills we go, the more the jungle protrudes\
  \ over the path; seemingly unattended for quite some time. As we tuck in our chins\
  \ and ride headfirst through the scrub, the feeling of isolation increases, and\
  \ I can\u2019t help but let my mind drift to thoughts of predators in the jungle,\
  \ no doubt long gone from this area.\n\n\nAt last we come to a dead end. It\u2019\
  s hard to tell if this is where track is supposed to end, or if it\u2019s simply\
  \ a long, lost thoroughfare, reclaimed by the wilderness. Nevertheless, we are content.\
  \ We came to see that which we knew nothing of, and we found ourselves an exhilarating\
  \ adventure."
