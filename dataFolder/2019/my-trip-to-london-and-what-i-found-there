Text: "The first thing we did in London was making the check-in in the youth hostel.\
  \ We\u2019d never imagined we could find such a wonderful place turning the corner.\
  \ If you ever the opportunity to visit London, you have to stay in Palmers Lodge\
  \ Swiss Cottage. It\u2019s like living in Hogwarts, and that\u2019s the best thing\
  \ that can happen to you in London.\nAfter that, we begin to walk towards Abbey\
  \ Road. While walking though the streets, you discover the hidden London. After\
  \ that, we decided to visit all the free museums, starting with the British Museum\
  \ in whose entrance you can find a red phone box. The Natural History Museum also\
  \ surprised us with a piece of real moon rock. But most of all, you can\u2019t miss\
  \ entering in one of the covered underground stations which seem to be another town.\n\
  We\u2019re now in the huge queue of Westminster Abbey, but what people don\u2019\
  t know is you can enter in St. Margaret\u2019s Church for free, which is located\
  \ near the abbey and is also a protestant traditional church.\nThere is a zoo in\
  \ London, but if you want to see some animals the only thing you have to do is hire\
  \ a bike (for 2\xA3 a day) and ride it by the canal edge in the back of the zoo,\
  \ and you\u2019ll be able to see some peacocks and other animals.\nEveryone has\
  \ ever heard about the prime meridian, but for entering the Royal Observatory you\
  \ have to pay a ticket. But the Greenwich line can be seen through the bars at the\
  \ top of the hill. So you\u2019ll only have to pay the underground ticket towards\
  \ Greenwich and climb until the hill. Later, you can enjoy in the city food market\
  \ or walking into the streets because the atmosphere there is totally different\
  \ from the busy city.\nBack into the city, you can pay to look through the Tower\
  \ Bridge\u2019s glass walkways and admire the traffic jam.\nNow, at the other part\
  \ of the river, in quiets streets and in the top of an ancient church you can find\
  \ an old operating theatre and an herb garret. You feel to be in the past with the\
  \ wooden ground or with the plants\u2019 smell.\nIt\u2019s Sunday, and the Westminster\
  \ Cathedral is free visit. You can\u2019t miss the golden tops or the orange and\
  \ white front of the building. It\u2019s hidden round the corner and there you can\
  \ also find the Little Ben, the unknown Big Ben brother, or a ballerina dancing\
  \ in the top of Victoria Palace.\nThe most important theatre for Shakespeare was\
  \ The Globe, where you can attend an exposition in which you can see all the costumes\
  \ that they used to wear. You can also be part of a playing and record yourself\
  \ to hear it later. Of course I chose Juliet in the balcony scene. Later, you might\
  \ enjoy an original playing for only 5\xA3.\nThe Tower of London is such an iconic\
  \ place to visit. People usually queue to see the crown\u2019s jewels, but I recommend\
  \ the dragon in the White Tower which is made of weapons such us swords or guns.\
  \ And there\u2019s another room where you could challenge yourself with different\
  \ events.\nThe Kensington Palace isn\u2019t as surprising as others, but if you\
  \ finally decide to visit it, try to read everything in the room divider which is\
  \ placed in Victoria\u2019s room.\nAnother free and impacting thing you can do is\
  \ visiting the Sky Garden, you\u2019ll have to book in the internet but for free.\
  \ You\u2019ll be able to visit a garden inside the last floor of the building.\n\
  But what I\u2019ve never expect to find is such a wonderful atmosphere in the Sherlock\
  \ Holmes Museum, which also have a little Mrs. Hudson who guide you to the 221B\
  \ of Baker Street, whose number everyone knows isn\u2019t the correct one.\nWhen\
  \ we arrived at King\u2019s Cross Station the Platform 9 \xBE let me down. It\u2019\
  s not between two platforms, it\u2019s only a part of the wall in an ordinary place\
  \ of the station. But then, at Notting Hill Carnival I raise my spirits up again\
  \ because everyone was so friendly with you."
