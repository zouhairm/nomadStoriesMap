Text: "\"What if we have our lunch now? I am starting to feel hungry\"\n\"How about\
  \ that restaurant? Looks nice, isn't it?\"\n\nI tightened the black coat to cover\
  \ my entire chest. The sky was beautifully blue, but still, the windy December could\
  \ not lie. It was chilly midday for a tropical girl like me. I followed a group\
  \ of friends along with whom I traveled in Brussels. \n\nWe easily found a perfect\
  \ table to accommodate the ten of us. A waiter handed us a few menu books which\
  \ were enough for us to go through in pairs. My eyes were scanning the menu book\
  \ thoroughly. It was not that long for them to catch the word chicken and mushroom\
  \ in one sentence, together. Whenever I notice a chicken dish served with creamy\
  \ mushroom sauce, I will choose that without any second thought. They are a match\
  \ made in culinary heaven, in my opinion. \n\n\"Quarter chicken with mushroom sauce?\"\
  \ a different waiter came with a serving plate which surely was mine.\n\"Over here!\"\
  \ while excitedly raising my right-hand high.\n\nI noticed a slight change on his\
  \ face. He asked a question with a lower voice tone, \"Oh! Miss, is this your order?\"\
  \ The pleasing smell of the food took my attention away for a second, but I quickly\
  \ nodded to answer him.\n\n\"Miss, I am sorry but I am afraid I have to offer you\
  \ another choice of sauce. Since this mushroom sauce actually contains alcohol.\
  \ I believe you are a Muslim and you cannot consume alcohol, can you?\" I was sure\
  \ that my mouth was about to make an O shape. His comprehensive attention just put\
  \ me in awe. It was, of course, my hijab (headscarf) that made him identified me\
  \ correctly. \n\nI nodded again, \"yeah sure!\" and asked him in return \"what should\
  \ I choose then?\".\n\"What about black pepper sauce? It is safe for you\" while\
  \ smiling and I could not help but smiling back at him to agree to his offer. \n\
  \n\"Wow, he is such an amazing waiter! Never seen something like that before\",\
  \ commented one guy in the group, after the waiter left. Neither did I. \n\nI did\
  \ not know whether he is a Muslim himself. Because I could not judge from his outward\
  \ aspects \u2013 and no one should ever judge other people just from what appears\
  \ right in front of their eyes.\n\nHave been born, raised and was once moved for\
  \ higher studies, all those happened in countries where Muslims are the major population.\
  \ So technically, I am always a member of the majority. However, putting myself\
  \ in different environments and traveling to other countries, is not something rare\
  \ for me. Being said that, this was not my first experience to travel around a country\
  \ where I was being a minority. But to actually receive special attention from a\
  \ stranger, who understood my religion\u2019s teaching, was the first. \n\nI could\
  \ not be more grateful for the chance that I owned, to be able to place myself in\
  \ a situation where I could learn to be a minority and to appreciate every little\
  \ thing shown by other people along the trip. The unexpected things make me adore\
  \ traveling even more.\n\nHe was back to our table with \u201Cquarter chicken with\
  \ black pepper sauce for you, miss!\u201D while serving the plate on my table. \u201C\
  Enjoy your lunch!\u201D and smiled. Black pepper might not be my most favorite sauce,\
  \ but that did not matter at all. Because all I saw was kindness and a pure heart\
  \ along the serving process, which made a simple lunch turned to be extraordinary.\n\
  \nI threw a big smile and sparkling eyes to him, \u201Cthank you so much!\u201D"
