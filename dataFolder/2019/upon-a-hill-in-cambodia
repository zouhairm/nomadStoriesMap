Text: "We were stuck in Kampot. We were pleased that our Vietnamese Visas had been\
  \ approved, but we were disappointed that my 4 looked too much like an 8 on the\
  \ application. We were staying in Cambodia an unplanned additional four days. Kampot\
  \ is fantastic but we had visited all the pepper plantations and indulged in enough\
  \ boozy sunset river cruises. My fiance and I were open to any suggestion for new\
  \ activities. I was eating fish amok in an expat bar when someone suggested we motorbike\
  \ up Bokor Mountain.\n\tThe next day we headed out of town. It started to drizzle.\
  \ The bikes whined upwards. I expected to eventually emerge above the clouds\nFirst,\
  \ we found the church. It looked exactly as an old church should. Small and boxy\
  \ with thick stone walls, it could have drawn by a child with crayons. The drizzle\
  \ had suspended into a thick fog. We were cool and damp walking up the stone path\
  \ toward the open door. We had read this church had been a stronghold for the Khmer\
  \ Rouge when they fought the Vietnamese and was one of their last holdouts in the\
  \ early \u201990s. For the first times in months, I felt a chill.\nThe floor was\
  \ dusty cement. The walls had been covered with graffiti, primitive scratched initials\
  \ and dates, the wall behind the altar, though, displayed colorful designs and framed\
  \ photos of Jesus and Mary. On the stone table, there were two glasses of what appeared\
  \ to be white wine and fresh flowers in a vase. Cracks spiderwebbed along the walls\
  \ and up the ceiling. \n Mist tumbled into the windows but never seemed to reach\
  \ the floor. I felt like I had spent 4 hours inside, perhaps it was just four minutes.\
  \ There wasn\u2019t a plaque to let visitors know what had happened there. There\
  \ was no ticket takers, no lines, and no people. There were holes in the wall that\
  \ were used to shoot out, now they only let light in.\n\tWe kept riding and ended\
  \ up exploring several other abandoned buildings. They had been second homes for\
  \ the French and Khmer elite so they could escape the heat of Southeast Asia. The\
  \ walls were more diversely tagged up but in far worse disrepair. It was difficult\
  \ to imagine how grand these homes were. Intricate tile work lies shattered on the\
  \ floor seemingly held in place with mud. The graffiti on the walls ranged from\
  \ \u201CGO VEGAN PUSSY\u201D to incredible murals and portraits. There was no glass\
  \ left in any of the windows. I assumed they had great views of the town or the\
  \ Gulf of Thailand, but I could only see fog. The world seemed to fall away after\
  \ only a few feet beyond the sills.\nThen it rained, hard. We got on our motorbikes\
  \ to head back down to Kampot. From the road, most of the buildings were barely\
  \ visible. It poured. The road we had taken up was in good shape but steep. We were\
  \ not willing to risk sliding out and becoming one of the many bandaged tourists\
  \ limping around Southeast Asia.\nWe pulled off into the parking lot of a recently\
  \ opened casino. They had taken out a 99-year lease on the land. They also paved\
  \ the road we had come up to easier shuttle busloads of tourists to the newly built\
  \ palace. \nWe were soaked.\n\tTwo men held the door open as we walked through.\
  \ The main lobby was enormous. All of the abandoned buildings we had explored could\
  \ have fit inside. I had braced for the flashing lights and chiming bells of slot\
  \ machines. It was silent. The only indication that this wasn\u2019t another abandoned\
  \ structure was the idle employees checking their phone or wiping down an already\
  \ immaculate counter. The air conditioning was set to artic.\n Eventually, we found\
  \ a sign pointing us up the grand staircase to the casino. My footsteps echoed off\
  \ the marble. I was shivering. We sat at the blackjack table. A waitress floated\
  \ off and brought me hot tea. The only other player smoked a cigarette two tables\
  \ away.\nWe won. We lost. I warmed. \nThen it was time to leave."
