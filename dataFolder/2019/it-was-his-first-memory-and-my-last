Text: "I was alone waiting for the streetcar to arrive. Suddenly, a thin and tall\
  \ guy appeared walking slowly. He was following the instructions of Google Maps.\
  \ I was looking at him a few meters away when he began to approach me.\n\"Excuse\
  \ me. Is this the bus station?,\" he asked to break the silence.\n\"No, it's the\
  \ streetcar station,\" I replied.\n\"Does it work like the bus?\" \n\"Where do you\
  \ need to go? Perhaps I can help you.\"\n\nHe pointed at the destination on the\
  \ screen. In the distance, I heard the bells announcing the passage of the streetcar.\
  \ \u201CI have to go, but you can come with me and I\u2019ll show you where you\
  \ should get off,\u201D I said. \nJade agreed.\n\nThe streetcar arrived. He removed\
  \ his hood and ran his hand through his straight black hair. \u201CI\u2019m Jade,\
  \ from Korea,\u201D he said. He put his backpack on the floor and started explaining\
  \ to me that he had just arrived in Toronto to study English. I listened to him\
  \ while I gazed the landscape through the window: trees that were shaken by the\
  \ wind and colorful leaves covering the sidewalk.  \n\nThe streetcar was going slowly.\
  \ We kept silent for a while and I laid my head on the window. Jade stared at me\
  \ and asked shyly: \n\u201CWhere are you going?\u201D \n\u201CI\u2019m going to\
  \ the CN Tower. It is my last day in Toronto and I want to have a view of the city,\
  \ the perfect spot for a farewell\" \n\u201CCould I go with you?\" \nI nodded as\
  \ I smiled. \n\nAfter we bought the tickets in the Tower, we took an elevator. It\
  \ was already night. The floor was made of glass: as we went up, we could see how,\
  \ below us, downtown Toronto skyscrapers were getting smaller. Jade opened his backpack\
  \ and prepared his professional Nikon camera. After we climbed 346 meters, the doors\
  \ opened. There was the greatest Canadian city looking so tiny. \n\nThe long streets\
  \ I walked for three months now seemed to be short and narrow lines that divided\
  \ the city into small squares. There was the Lake Ontario, looking calm, as if it\
  \ was not rocking the boats; I watched, quietly, the reflection of the lights on\
  \ the Lake. There was Harbourfront Centre, the park where I first tried the beaver\
  \ tail dessert; I still had the taste of maple honey and fried-dough pastry in my\
  \ mouth. I went even closer to the panoramic window walls and there was me reflected\
  \ in them, enjoying an unexpected moment and listening to the flash of Jade's camera\
  \ with a lump in my throat.\n        \nJade was moving back and forward to try to\
  \ find the best angle for a photo. Half an hour passed and we decided to go the\
  \ SkyPod, the highest part of the Tower. We took the elevator again to go up 101\
  \ meters more. I felt how my ears plugged. \u201CThank you for letting me share\
  \ with you my first memory of Toronto, and your last,\u201D Jade said right before\
  \ the elevator opened its doors.   \n\nImmediately, he started taking pictures again.\
  \ Every time Jade moved the lens of his camera to allow the image to be sharp, a\
  \ wrinkle was formed between his eyebrows. It was inevitable to look at him without\
  \ feeling jealous: I was about to leave that city, but he was going to stay there,\
  \ enjoying the Lake, the museums, the Victorian architecture, the sound of the bells\
  \ that announce the passage of the streetcar, and the squirrels that run to climb\
  \ tree trunks so fast. We continued observing that infinite horizon. It seemed as\
  \ if the cars were not going fast along the highways. Jade took one last picture\
  \ before putting his camera in the backpack. \n\nWe descended 447 meters and took\
  \ a bus to go to the subway Union Station. When we arrived, he hugged me as he said\
  \ \"Thank you, Camila!.\" He entered the subway wagon and the doors closed. Jade\
  \ waved his hand. The subway started to move. After a few seconds, the last wagon\
  \ began to hide inside the tunnel, like a turtle sheltering in its shell. It was\
  \ his first memory, and my last."
