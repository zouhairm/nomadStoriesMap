Text: "They met in Ecuador. He was on a study abroad semester and she was a Peruvian\
  \ architecture student competing in a Longboard competition. Their stars aligned\
  \ and they committed to joining their lives. The couple returned to the groom\u2019\
  s family home located in the state of Wisconsin and exchanged their vows of love\
  \ in the dense northern Boreal forest near the shores of Lake Superior.\n\nFamily\
  \ and friends traveled from distant lands and nearby towns. Neighbors hosted the\
  \ travelers from Peru, Denmark, Los Angeles and New York City in their homes. The\
  \ others found lodging at Inns, hotels, and tents in the woods. Many meals were\
  \ shared. This diverse community worked side by side on the wedding preparations,\
  \ communicating through Spanish and English as one family with a common purpose.\
  \ The purpose of celebrating love. \n\nThe farmer down the road raised the pig,\
  \ which would feed many. An Auntie created a beautiful cake. A local chef prepared\
  \ the meal from primarily local ingredients. The groom\u2019s father fermented a\
  \ hard cider for the toast and brewed a maple ale for the guests. Family, friends,\
  \ and neighbors all played a part, shared a talent and contributed to the celebration.\
  \ \n\nThe rain clouds parted for an impassioned ritual in the woodland sanctuary.\
  \ A dear friend sang \u201CGracias a la Vida\u201D while a neighbor strummed background,\
  \ on his guitar. The ceremony progressed into a glowing celebration under twinkling\
  \ lights and a full moon. The Peruvian tradition of Hora Loca brought all the guests\
  \ to the dance floor under the trees, twirling and grooving into the morning. Fireworks\
  \ lit up the dark sky to commemorate the celebration. \n\nThe following morning\
  \ guests helped wash the dishes and clean the grounds before the rains returned.\
  \ Engaged in this celebration, the friends became family and the two families became\
  \ one. They traveled near and far to participate in a beautiful celebration of life\
  \ and made the journey of love.\n\nTo see photos with this story, please visit my\
