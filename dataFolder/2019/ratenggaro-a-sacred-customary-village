Text: "Travelling is so much more than just sightseeing for me, it is more into immersing\
  \ yourself to the locals and making connections; a memory that has a deeper meaning.\
  \ One of the memorable places my friends and I visited were Ratenggaro village in\
  \ Southwest Sumba, Indonesia. Ratenggaro village is one of an indigenous village\
  \ with a rich cultural heritage, from the way of life to its traditional houses.\
  \ All houses were made of local resources: hand-carved wooden pillar, dried grass\
  \ rooftops, and bamboo flooring; no concrete nor aluminium were found! For each\
  \ house built, they will have months of the ceremony accompanying each step of the\
  \ house building process (Months!!!). What is more astonishing is that any house\
  \ built in Ratenggaro is built by all adult villagers (Yep, you read it right. ALL\
  \ villagers with no exception). In Marapu tradition, a form of ancestral religion\
  \ where they still have cattle as sacrificial mean, there are two main houses: the\
  \ house of dad (Ama) and the house of mom (Ina). They are actually a really a private\
  \ village. Though there are visitors coming in and out for sightseeing, there are\
  \ few of them that actually interact with outsiders. That is a pity actually. I\
  \ don\u2019t know why they did what they did though.\n\nGreat things were, when\
  \ we visited Ratenggaro, there was a welcoming ceremony in one of the main houses.\
  \ We had a chance to actually see the live traditional ceremony and recorded it!\
  \ Apparently, there were a few steps in ceremonial rituals for welcoming honourable\
  \ guests in Marapu. We happened to be seeing the very first step of the rituals\
  \ (Yay!). The first rituals aimed to see the very intention of the guests, whether\
  \ they meant well or not (Beware, thief! The ghosts of Ratenggaro\u2019s ancestral\
  \ were lurking and watching). The rituals started with a welcoming speech and prayer\
  \ by a local priest using Kodi language. It was then continued with the sacrificial\
  \ ritual of a rooster (Eeek, bloody!!). They purposely slit the rooster in front\
  \ of everyone (at this point I just pray furiously that there was no messy blood\
  \ splatter. I fought myself from flinching away since it would be considered as\
  \ rude). The blood was then kept in a plastic basin, while the priest kept a few\
  \ of the feather and tied it all together in the sacred-corner place within the\
  \ house. They said that special little corner was the place where the ancestral\
  \ spirit hangs out and chill while watching over their great-great-great-grandkids.\n\
  \nThe priest continued to ramble few words in the local language, while the rooster\
  \ was grilled with the feather still attached (Yep! They did not pluck the feather.\
  \ They just put it on the grill!). After an hour of waiting, the grilled chicken\
  \ was being split into two and the priest starts to examine the chicken\u2019s intestines\
  \ and livers. Legend has it, if the liver were split or the intestines being entangled\
  \ when opened, it was the way of the ancestor that the newcomer meant no good. Thus,\
  \ they should drive out the newcomer immediately. Should they still wanted to enter\
  \ (immerse) the village, the village should hold another ceremony with bigger sacrificial\
  \ to ask for ancestors\u2019 forgiveness and begging them to allow this newcomer\
  \ to come; something big like pigs or buffalos. Afterwards, they need to repeat\
  \ the rooster rituals all over again to see whether the ancestor had accepted their\
  \ intentions. \n\nAfter a thrilling minute of examination, the priest finally said\
  \ that the newcomer was most welcomed in the village (fiuuhh. I didn\u2019t realize\
  \ that I held my breath for few seconds when the translator started to speak to\
  \ deliver the verdict!). The rituals ended with having meals together (with chicken\
  \ as its main dishes of course. But, it was unplucked chicken! Just saying though).\
  \ Finally, we all ate. How in the world was I able to eat although I wasn\u2019\
  t part of the honourable guests\u2019 entourage, you say? Well, they were kind enough\
  \ to share with us (but most likely they saw us looking hungry, tired, and all.\
  \ I don\u2019t know. Lucky, I guess?!)."
