Text: "After a 30 minute walk down a lonely country road, my head lamp picked up white\
  \ paint on a wooden sign. It was shaped like a surfboard and bore the words \"Okinawa\
  \ Nakijin\". The campground had 4 raised tent sites, one of which was occupied by\
  \ a couple with a heater pumping and a television blaring. We threw our bags down\
  \ on one of the tent platforms, then wandered around looking for the campground\
  \ host. There were two buildings near the tenting sites. One looked like an office,\
  \ the other like a living room.\n\n\"Hello? Konbanwa?\" I said cautiously into the\
  \ doorways. Lights were on, and it felt like someone was there, but nobody was around.\
  \ My wife and I creeped into the building that looked like a living room, and found\
  \ another room, this one full of rental gear. There was a toilet in the building.\
  \ We relieved ourselves, and decided to set up camp and sort the rest out in the\
  \ morning. I could tell Tiffany was uncomfortable with the situation, and I compensated\
  \ by being overly chipper about everything.\n\n\"What a grand adventure we are having.\"\
  \ \"Camping in Japan is so interesting!\" \"Can you believe those people brought\
  \ a TV out here?\" As far as our marriage is concerned, this was one of those times\
  \ when we weren't quite on the same page. I fell asleep with my fingers and toes\
  \ crossed, hoping a new day would shed better light on our camping experience.\n\
  \nThe gods of Okinawa were gracious with me the next morning. The first hints of\
  \ a new day grew into a spectacular sunrise. As Tiffany and I sat in our sleeping\
  \ bags at the edge of the water, daylight revealed that we were camping in paradise.\
  \ Tiny islands dotted the vista, and the nearness of coves across the water gave\
  \ a sense of coziness. A faint smile cracked on Tiffany's lips.\n\nAs the sun finished\
  \ its ascent, I looked towards to office building and saw the silhouette of a man\
  \ leaning against the wall. The campground manager looked bewildered. I suppose\
  \ it was a bit mystical of us to arrive unnoticed after dark, a couple of kilometers\
  \ from the nearest bus stop, with no vehicle.\n\nThe campground manager and I pieced\
  \ together the details of our check-in using his limited English and my limited\
  \ Japanese. He showed us where the toilets were, but they were not the toilets we\
  \ had used the night before. I realized that the building with the living room must\
  \ be his house, and that I must have used his private toilet the night before. I\
  \ was embarrassed, and hoped that he didn't notice the squares of toilet paper that\
  \ didn't quite flush. \n\nAs the tour finished, and we walked back towards our tent,\
  \ the campground manager shouted \"botoru,\" as though he had just realized something.\
  \ Bottle. I left my water bottle sitting on his living room table when I used his\
  \ toilet. My cheeks turned a shade of red that had nothing to do with the sunburn\
  \ on my face. I uttered \"thank you\" and \"sorry\" in Japanese, then shuffled back\
  \ to the tent.\n\nNo matter how respectfully we approach traveling, there will always\
  \ be moments where we are horrified to discover that we are the obnoxious foreigners\
  \ we so dread. These moments offer the humility we need to continue to remember\
  \ to be mindful of others as we wander throughout the world. They give the victims\
  \ our our faux pas opportunities to show us cultural grace and good humor.\n\nThe\
  \ campground manager turned out to be not only gracious, but an adventurous and\
  \ interesting kindred spirit. Despite the language barrier, we would become friends\
  \ by the end of our stay, and share good food and hearty laughs together in the\
  \ little paradise in Nakijin that he calls home."
