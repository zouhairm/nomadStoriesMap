Text: "Finally, we arrived at what would become our home for the next ten days, which\
  \ would seem like an eternity for many of us. Once a year, 70,000 humans gather\
  \ in the desert dust of The Middle of Nowhere, Nevada and create an impermanent\
  \ functioning city. A city so big, that for those 10 days, it\u2019s the third biggest\
  \ in the state. \n\nTo some it seems crazy, why one would take months of preparing,\
  \ days of traveling, hours of waiting in a line of cars, all to get to nowhere land;\
  \ an ecologically harsh environment that will instantly cover your entire body in\
  \ a layer of desert dust, sunburn your skin to a crisp, and push you to your limits\
  \ in every way you can imagine. I hope this story gives you a glimpse into why we\
  \ gather from all over the world in honor of this insane, temporary playground called\
  \ Burning Man.\n\nThe sky went from blue, to orange, to pink, to indigo, as if it\
  \ were showing off its magic just for us. I climbed up onto a nearby U-haul truck\
  \ to tune into this immaculate performance. Atop the truck I found some friends,\
  \ and together we basked in the beauty of the ever-evolving sky. When night fell,\
  \ we admired the moon rising with its warm and gentle glow. During this prolonged\
  \ moment of appreciation, there suddenly appeared in the sky, a second moon. There\
  \ was something intensely magical about this second moon, the phases where ever-changing;\
  \ from crescent, to half, to gibbous, to full, and back to new. Everyone on the\
  \ U-haul was instantly jaw dropped in awe at this confusing yet enchanting phenomenon.\
  \ \n\nConversation started among us, filling the air with our questions and ideas\
  \ on how this lunar magic was in action before our eyes. It seemed too far away\
  \ to be an art installation, yet we entertained all ideas that came to the table.\
  \ Our group of head-scratching humans got down from the truck in a curiosity filled\
  \ determination to get to the bottom of this mystery.  We embarked on a voyage across\
  \ the desert, stumbling upon many unexpected detours along the way. We stopped for\
  \ a bit to warm up by a wrought iron octopus throwing fire, hopped on a magic carpet\
  \ driven by what seemed like a 200 year old man, climbed the stairs to the top of\
  \ a ginormous LED-lit rainbow, and somehow crawled down a creepy tunnel leading\
  \ to an elegant renaissance-themed speak easy. At each stop, we told strangers about\
  \ our journey to the moon, and our crew organically grew with each conversation,\
  \ as well as our determination. Strangers soon became friends, and after what seemed\
  \ like hours of walking and lifetimes of experiences, we arrived right under the\
  \ ever-changing moon. \n\nOur crew of eighteen was a speck of dust in the huge crowd\
  \ we came upon. It was as if hundreds, maybe thousands of people all over the city\
  \ were committed to getting to the moon just like us. We made our way through the\
  \ crowd, hearing many different languages and conversations speaking of this craziness.\
  \ Finally, what we found was a tiny, young woman on her bike. There was a rope attached\
  \ to the bike and it connected to the moon above, which was a floating balloon-like\
  \ sphere, half painted black and half a glowing moonscape. The natural spinning\
  \ of this sphere made it seem like the moon was going through its phases. Our crew\
  \ plopped down on the dusty desert laughing hysterically. The moon was attached\
  \ to her bike! This one woman and her art project encouraged us (and thousands of\
  \ others) to question the laws of physics and journey across the desert, enjoying\
  \ every moment and detour of the lunar quest. \n\nThis story is about what we didn\u2019\
  t expect to find; a microcosmic example of how Burning Man brings us together. The\
  \ ever-unfolding magic of the playa expands our perceptions of reality, lets us\
  \ bask in wonder and awe, encourages us to be playful, and reminds us to enjoy every\
  \ fleeting moment of life\u2019s adventures."
