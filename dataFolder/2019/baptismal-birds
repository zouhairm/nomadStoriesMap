Text: "The sand was reaching out to my vulnerable, bare soles, bringing a warm comfort\
  \ as I nervously made a slow path along the beach. I tried to avoid eye contact\
  \ with the locals mostly because they were topless, toned and dreadlocked male muscles\
  \ leaping over to anyone they deemed available for a boat ride.\n\nMy friend went\
  \ off with a guy from this beach once and he pulled the small boat into the private\
  \ island, only to drop his pants. That was quite an introduction to the island customs.\
  \ After a quick glance and an even swifter scolding, he, head down, took her back\
  \ to the main beach, where she repeatedly told this story to a room full of giggles.\n\
  \nI didn't come to St Lucia for the unexpected; I came to escape the known. The\
  \ sun streamed through the lazy breeze and I squinted at the notion of paradise\
  \ in the distance. My eyes followed the length of the beach to see a small wooden\
  \ fence surrounding hanging structures for sale. My curiosity peaked and I cautiously\
  \ stepped over the low fence to have a closer look. Birds, made from coconut shells,\
  \ hanging. I marvelled at the unique human ability to construct such artistic wonders\
  \ from the simplicity of supposed nature's discards. \n\nGushing over his work of\
  \ art, he simply smiled a toothless grin as his leathery face folded unto itself\
  \ in pleasure. No sales talk needed in the presence greatness. I had left my purse\
  \ in the hotel so I selfishly promised to be back. He simply nodded in a relaxed\
  \ way, secretly knowing I was sincere. I wondered back out into my thoughts of escapism\
  \ of nature's music as my soul danced to the rhymthic waves against my feet.\n\n\
  Leaving the hotel a few hours later to explore the city once the sun had cooled\
  \ down, I walked along the main road to the city. There was a long, windy footpath\
  \ from the beach to the main road, and a toothless grin suddenly appeared beside\
  \ me as he juggled his coconut sculptures in his bag with ease. \n\nHe warmly greeted\
  \ me on his walk home, and asked what my plans were. \"I need to buy gifts for my\
  \ friends and family.\", I replied. \"I know just the place.\", he responded. He\
  \ walked beside me acting like a bodyguard to the many locals wanting to sell a\
  \ trip to done fantasy or other. I was at ease in his calm, protective, helpful\
  \ presence.\n\nLooking at one of the tourist shops, there was a hat with dreadlocks\
  \ sewn into in, I said, \"Come, let's take a selfie.\" He willingly obliged to my\
  \ recent Instagram obsession, him mostly looking and laughing at me with this Rastafarian\
  \ hat on. I bought all the little trinkets that I would carry and he offered to\
  \ help me carry them back to my hotel. \"Thank you!\", I was never going to say\
  \ no to a gentleman carrying my shopping!\n\nOnce I arrived at the huge white compound,\
  \ the security guard eyed my new friend suspiciously. \"Would you like to come to\
  \ the bar for some pizza?\", I said loud enough for the security to hear. \"Sure.\"\
  , he gave a big smile back. I hate inequality of any kind, and so I always feel\
  \ pizza levels the playing field; I learnt these deep pan lessons from the very\
  \ green Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. \n\nWe sat down in the elegant establishment,\
  \ laughing, musing and eating pizza with our hands. It was artist to artist; spirit\
  \ to spirit, just how the world is supposed to be around the bonding glue of gluten\
  \ crust and cheesy goodness. This was the beginning of an adventure into the real\
  \ heart of St Lucia, the concrete escapes of the inner city bustle, coconut water\
  \ sipping markets, great authentic tastes all piled up high like mountains, ashy\
  \ baptisms at sunrise and volcanic mud baths before sitting in rum shacks to await\
  \ the end of the rainpour: the biggest downpour being on my cheeks as I left this\
  \ majestic, magical place. I felt like a bird being birthed from a coconut shell:\
  \ I thought I wouldn't belong, but instead it was most memorable."
