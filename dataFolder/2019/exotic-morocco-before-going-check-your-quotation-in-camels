Text: "My journey leg starts from Spain towards Morocco. It was no difficult to adapt\
  \ to the Spanish rhythm, which means that after the country\u2019s farewell, my\
  \ adventure to Morocco began with a mild hangover and an aspirin.\n\nWe crossed\
  \ the Strait of Gibraltar towards Tangier. From there we continued to Lagash. The\
  \ most impressive are the exotic landscapes along the roads. We saw desert areas,\
  \ right after green grass, then cacti and crops ahead. We made a stop at a viewpoint\
  \ that was right in the place where the waters of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic\
  \ meet. Pictures, please!\n\nWe stopped for lunch in Lagash and there I had the\
  \ first experience of going into a bathroom with the toilet buried on the floor.\
  \ I am six fit tall, so imagine the situation. There was also no sink, but a plastic\
  \ jar with water inside a basin. Another striking factor in Lagash was the boys\
  \ selling sheepskins, exposed along the street, probably resulting from the ram's\
  \ feasts, which happen right after the arrival of those who went to Mecca (each\
  \ family kills a ram and donates 1/3, anonymously, to the poor). \n\nWe continued\
  \ towards to Rabat, administrative capital of Morocco. It is not a wonderful city,\
  \ but it has a lot of green. We knew the Royal Palace and the mausoleum where the\
  \ tomb of Mohamed V is, known by the Moroccan as the liberator of the kingdom. The\
  \ ceiling is all covered of gold and it\u2019s guarded by soldiers, in the \u201C\
  english style\u201D. Pause to the flashes with the motionless guards! Right in front,\
  \ there were the ruins of a basilica destroyed by an earthquake. Only the minaret,\
  \ tower that calls the Muslims for the prayer, remained. We heard the call, a kind\
  \ of mantra, for the fourth prayer of the day.\n\nOn the next day we went to Casablanca,\
  \ industrial capital of Morocco.  In fact, from \u201Cblanca\u201D (\u201Cwhite\u201D\
  \ in Spanish) there is nothing, it\u2019s a completely brown city. But it\u2019\
  s more cosmopolitan, beautiful and on the seashore, there are wonderful natural\
  \ pools. On the waterfront there are bars and fast foods like Mc Donald's, for example,\
  \ that offers the McArabian. There is also the highest and second more spacious\
  \ mosque of the world \u2013 the Hassan Mosque -, with a capacity for 25.000 people,\
  \ built above the sea. We, poor westerns, could only look, we were not allowed to\
  \ get in.\n\nWe proceed to Marrakech. Like every city in Morocco it has the modern\
  \ part, the jewish quarter and the medina (old trade). In the jewish quarter we\
  \ knew a natural pharmacy where we had an aromas and mixtures class. There I discovered\
  \ the secret of several Muslims to support Ramadan. They produce powerful weight\
  \ loss teas that inhibit appetite. We also knew the famous Jemma El Fna square,\
  \ where besides products and food, there are snake charmers, dancers and little\
  \ monkeys that go up on your shoulder and only leave after payment. And believe\
  \ it\u2026 they bargain for euros! We went to Fantasia too, where we spent a magic\
  \ night with a traditional Moroccan dish, dance shows and a camel ride at the end.\
  \ It\u2019s kind of a Moroccan Medieval Times.\n \nOur last stop was in Fez, were\
  \ we went to the famous market Fez El-Bali, patrimony of the Humanity by Unesco\
  \ since 1981.  I knew one of the equally famous tanneries. From the terrace you\
  \ can see the leather dyeing tanks. The smell was not very pleasant.\n\nOne thing\
  \ I learned in Morocco is: if you are a woman, avoid unaccompanied walking and don\u2019\
  t dare lighting a cigarette by the street. My experience showed local women are\
  \ not usually so friendly in that cases. Second lesson: don\u2019t be deceived when\
  \ you see small hatches, behind them we can find real palaces. And the last learning:\
  \ men like to come on to women, offering mostly camels, as if you were a commodity.\
  \ They even offered me 20,000 camels! I found out that my quote was high, and I\
  \ was a little overweight. If they make a lot of pass at you believe me, you're\
  \ chubby, their standard of beauty is more \u201Cabout that bass\u201D."
