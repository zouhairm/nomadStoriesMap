Text: "I've read about The Alps in a few fictional books and it is often described\
  \ as a looming mass of earth, an enemy to light aircrafts, and a playground for\
  \ adventurers! \nWe drove around the Pennine Alps, which is the mountain range across\
  \ South West Switzerland (in the area of Valais) as well as North West Italy (in\
  \ the Aosta Valley). I am truly on cloud nine after viewing this magnificent landscape\
  \ myself \U0001F499\U0001F3D4\uFE0F\U0001F499\U0001F5FB The cable cars of Zermatt\
  \ carried us up a 2km ascent to the peak of Klein Matterhorn at an altitude of 3,883m.\
  \ I'd say I'm a little less confident when it comes to heights\U0001F648 so I was\
  \ quite delighted that the air was still! With a bit of wind at that altitude and\
  \ a swinging cable car, I would have certainly chickened out\U0001F602 Zermatt is\
  \ heaven on earth for skiers so we were slightly out of place as the foreigners\
  \ who weren't hitting the slopes! Perhaps I'll head back to the mountains to ski\
  \ when I'm sure that I wouldn't resemble a giraffe drinking water\U0001F61C\n\n\
  The Matterhorn, which is Switzerland's famous pyramid-shaped peak (or widely recognised\
  \ as the mountain on the Toblerone box\U0001F601), felt incredibly close from this\
  \ viewing point yet it is much higher in altitude at 4,478m. It's not the highest\
  \ but certainly the most distinctive mountain in The Alps\U0001F60D With the luck\
  \ of having clear blue skies on the day we visited, we could easily see the noble\
  \ peak of Mont Blanc, which is the highest in The Alps at an altitude of 4,808m.\n\
  \nThis adventure, however, was not all about The Alps! We also spent a night in\
  \ a 15th century medieval mountain house called La Confr\xE9rie du Moyen \xC0ge\
  \ (in a village with 10 permanent residents), which was inherited by a family from\
  \ their grandparents. They have paperwork of ancestral lineage dating back to the\
  \ 1700s, indicating ownership of the main part of the house as it stands today.\
  \ The family, involved in antique collection and restoration, renovated the house\
  \ over a period of 7 years and filled it with items from as far back as the 12th\
  \ century! It felt like we were transported to the middle ages, and we dined at\
  \ a 15th century table wearing medieval-style clothing - it was surreal \U0001F3DA\
