Text: "\u201CI\u2019m going to live in a castle in the south of France and do yoga.\u201D\
  \ This was my line for months leading up to the four weeks I would spend amongst\
  \ rolling hills, small towns and sunflower fields at Chateau de Goas in Gers. I\
  \ knew it wouldn\u2019t be Cinderella\u2019s castle, and the purpose of the visit\
  \ to the yoga retreat centre was to work on renovations, but when I got there I\
  \ discovered the real meaning of \u201Crustic\u201D and \u201Ca work in progress\u201D\
  . \n\nI arrived at the castle on a hot Sunday afternoon. Michel, a Corsican retiree,\
  \ drove down the picturesque lane and took a hard left to arrive at the back door.\
  \ Meant for servants in the 1700\u2019s, the kitchen was the least idealistic entrance\
  \ to any estate. Already my romanticized idea of the place was crumbling. The small\
  \ kitchen was dusty and dim despite the large window, with cobwebs near the 10\u2019\
  \ ceilings that no one had bothered to remove. Michel abandoned me to his sitting\
  \ room and I met one of the Texans. He was a bohemian, non-conformist, bearded conservative\
  \ with one dreadlock and hair pulled back into a ponytail. He showed me to the Rose\
  \ room on the second floor.\n\n\u201CMake sure you close your windows when it starts\
  \ getting dark, otherwise the bats get in. And don\u2019t flush anything down the\
  \ toilets in your room except liquid, if possible. Use the one down the hall for\
  \ number two. And there are Asian Hornets, which will kill you, at the other end\
  \ of the house, so just be aware. We\u2019ll meet in the kitchen for lunch in thirty\
  \ minutes.\u201D \nThe door closed and I stood looking around my spacious and sparsely\
  \ furnished room. Three double beds with slightly mismatched bedding and an old\
  \ dresser between the windows. What have I gotten myself into? \nThe only people\
  \ residing at the castle were Michel, the Texans, a German couple, and a woman from\
  \ Denver who soon became my coffee, snacks and sarcasm buddy. \n\nThe next two weeks\
  \ were full of surprises. There were hornets dropping in for dinner, too much quinoa,\
  \ and both cats had fleas. The dogs bathed themselves in a lake and ran through\
  \ a forest to return to the castle where they had free reign, and spiders crawled\
  \ on the ceiling right over my head one sleepless night. I had occasional political\
  \ arguments with the Texan, and there was no yoga to speak of. \n\nThe attitude\
  \ at the castle was as dim as the lighting with a sarcastic kicker and despite trying\
  \ to make the best of things in the first few days, I was ready to pack my bags\
  \ and ask Michel to take me back to Toulouse. That\u2019s when a bright, shiny,\
  \ vegan, model, writer, yogi princess from California waltzed right into the castle,\
  \ blinding me. It was uncomfortable at first, like turning on a light in the middle\
  \ of the night. Her life motto was \u201Cjoy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy, joy\u201D\
  \ and at the moment I wanted to smack her with some reality and make her see what\
  \ #castlelife was really about. The next day a bright young woman from Indianapolis\
  \ joined us, also filled with high hopes, ideas for adventure, and a yoga certificate.\
  \ It was with the addition of these two remarkable women that my time at the castle\
  \ turned from grim to inspirational. \n\nBetween hours of solitude in my task of\
  \ laying flooring in the yoga studio, coffee in the morning with Denver, long walks\
  \ with California or Indianapolis through the French countryside, and vacuuming\
  \ every cobweb I could find, I began to clear out my soul of the very same cobwebs\
  \ and negativity. Being surrounded by fields of flowers, spectacular views, and\
  \ new people became completely liberating. On my last weekend in France the four\
  \ women of Chateau de Goas had an impromptu dinner of artichokes with lemon and\
  \ butter, vegan stew, and absolutely no quinoa. We did yoga and walked in the rain.\
  \  When we left the castle we had formed a sisterhood I never could have imagined,\
  \ and though there were still a few cobwebs in the castle, there were none in me."
