Text: "I was afraid of everything, even though I was in my own room. Well, it wasn\u2019\
  t exactly my room. Sure, it belongs to me, but it wasn\u2019t mine. Mine was 200km\
  \ away from this house. But my room that was in my home was occupied by another\
  \ person, maybe it was were the dogs sleep in. \nI didn\u2019t leave that room in\
  \ days, even though I had to eat. I sneak in the night through the kitchen and ate\
  \ everything I haven\u2019t ate in the day, then sneak back to that insanely perfect\
  \ room. It was so perfect that I hate it. The door didn\u2019t make any sound and\
  \ the carpet was soft and fluffy. I really missed my old and insanely ugly room.\
  \ \nThe only people who I coexist in that room, was dead but alive in the same time.\
  \ They have died in different times, but they did some kind of witchcraft making\
  \ them be alive until the end of the time or maybe until the end of the paper and\
  \ the hard cover. Some of them were Germans, French, Mexicans, Uruguayan, British\
  \ or Japanese. They were from all around the world and all of them were there, with\
  \ me. Some of them were new, some of them didn\u2019t belong to me and had travel\
  \ a long distance and time until the land in to my hands. There were good friends.\
  \ They talk too much, and I listed too much also. So, we were perfect to each other\
  \ in an especial way. Sometimes I forgot about where I was, because some of them\
  \ took me to new places I have never seen before. Well, I must admit that those\
  \ places were so secret that anybody could ever reach them, only me. \nIt didn\u2019\
  t matter how much time passes, it didn\u2019t matter how many times the clock hands\
  \ pass though the same number, it didn\u2019t matter how many times the sunlight\
  \ reflects on my curtain or how many times it refracts on my window. I was submerged\
  \ in a sea of letters and I like it. Even thought the sea got crazier in the night,\
  \ more violent, more powerful, bigger and scarier, hitting my head with a lot of\
  \ \u201CO\xB4s\u201D and getting cut with \u201Cl\xB4s\u201D and \u201CI\xB4s\u201D\
  , getting pushed by \u201Cg\xB4s\u201D, \u201Cf\xB4s\u201D and \u201Ca\xB4s\u201D\
  . I learned how to surf in that sea, and how to swim in it.\nAs a matter of time\
  \ I met white paper. White books. White pages. Everything was white. I took one\
  \ page and leave it in front of me. We were both good listeners, so we stare each\
  \ other for a long time, waiting for someone to make the first move. The page looked\
  \ at my black eyes with his white body and dig through them until it reached my\
  \ mind. So, I talk.\nAfter a while I notice that my saliva was turning black, splashing\
  \ in the page\xB4s white body. It didn\u2019t matter that I wanted to stop, my tongue\
  \ didn\u2019t respond. I continued talking until I cried. I cried a single tear.\
  \ It was black, black as my saliva. That tear felt down in one white page. It was\
  \ a total mess, but the message was clear, crystal clear. I smiled showing my stained\
  \ white teeth."
