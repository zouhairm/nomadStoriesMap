Text: "Vadakke Manalath Govindan Nair, or Kalamandalam Gopi is the history of Kathakali\
  \ in a human form. Born in 1937 he is still active and performing on the stages\
  \ of India and around the world. It is beautiful to observe the weight of its history\
  \ and the relationship that artists and admirers of traditional Kerala\xB4s art\
  \ have with this gentleman. Wherever he goes he is revered and his trajectory is\
  \ taken as an example of talent, dedication and love to art. In addition to Kathakali,\
  \ he has also appeared in several movies demonstrating his versatility in performing\
  \ the actor's craft on another platform. In short, a living legend.\n\nI was in\
  \ Cheruthuruthy studying the Kathakali for about 1 month already. This traditional\
  \ Kerala\xB4s art form mix dance and theater and has been performed for centuries.\
  \ The main focus of my studies was the music of the Kathakali. It was Saturday and\
  \ my intention was to spend the weekend at the beach, but a heavy rain (certainly\
  \ sent by the gods of Kathakali) changed the plans. I told my friend Kunhikrishnan\
  \ that I had canceled the trip to the coast. \"Today you will see the greatest star\
  \ of Kathakali.\" He said and grinned. The gleam in his eyes soon denounced that\
  \ was time to witness history being made. In the late afternoon, still under lots\
  \ of water, we headed to the village of Wadakkanchery, 10km away from the school\
  \ where I was living.\n\nUpon arrival at the performance site, the traditional \"\
  you're foreigner\" stares hitted me, always accompanied by shining smiles and the\
  \ inimitable indian nods. After some photos and chats with the people that were\
  \ there, I followed Kunhikrishnan to the dressing room to accompany the Chutti (Kathakali\
  \ makeup).\n\nIt is always interesting to see the preparation of the Kathakali actors\
  \ and to observe the delicacy and precision of the Chutti artists in their craft.\
  \ The process is long and accompanied by good conversations and lots of laughter.\
  \ I stayed there for about an hour until I was invited to visit Gopi\xB4s dressing\
  \ room, a rare opportunity, since the master has his restrictions and likes privacy\
  \ during his preparation before the performances. As I entered, the energy was almost\
  \ religious. The artist of Chutti was helping Gopi, in silence, to prepare his make\
  \ up and costume. Kunhikrishnan introduced me: \u201CThis young man is from Brazil\
  \ and is studying the Kathakali music!\u201D Surprised, Gopi grinned and greeted\
  \ me. I asked if I could photograph his preparation and he consented, so I stayed\
  \ there for a few minutes and, not wanting to disturb, thanked for the opportunity\
  \ and went to the door to leave. I\xB4m also an artist and I like to respect other\xB4\
  s rituals. Then the unforgettable moment came, Gopi calls me and said: \"Take one\
  \ more photo!\" Clumsily, I took the camera and pointed it at him. The legend stared\
  \ at the lens, as if to say \"enjoy young student, enjoy\". I clicked. Only once.\
  \ It was enough.\n\nStill excited about the moments lived there with the master,\
  \ I went out to have a snack and buy some things on the market. On the way back,\
  \ many people were already in the auditorium waiting for the performance to begin.\
  \ The artists were already fully dressed and doing the finishing touches on their\
  \ makeup. The story to be staged was Karnasaphatham, an epic narrative about Karna\
  \ (Gopi's character).\n\nThe performance was wonderful, 4 hours long. Gopi was on\
  \ the stage for most of the time. His age weighs heavily on some more physical scenes\
  \ (completely understandable, he is 80 years old), but the charisma and the density\
  \ with which he acts compensates any body limitation. His eyes, I\xB4ll never forget\
  \ how expressive they were, how alive. During the story, I often thought how lucky\
  \ I was to be there, sitting on the floor in the front row, watching a legend perform\
  \ his art.\n\nAfter the show ended, I dined in the auditorium with the new friends\
  \ made in the audience and returned to Cheruthuruthy satisfied, happy and with the\
  \ certainty that the loving embrace I gave in India was being returned day after\
  \ day in double."
