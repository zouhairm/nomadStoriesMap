Text: "We speed up. Faces and lights and words melt into a whirring blur of rock and\
  \ cables and black. My knees, slightly bent, help me balance my weight as the subway\
  \ car vigorously brakes and swerves, my hand loosely wrapped around the metal bar\
  \ above my head. My other hand hangs lazily over the lens of my camera, that dangles\
  \ from my neck. \nMy sister questioningly raises her eyebrows at me. I raise seven\
  \ fingers. She sighs. Six stops away from narrow, cobblestone-paved narrow streets,\
  \ cozy caf\xE9s and offhand photoshoots with the Sacr\xE9-C\u0153ur Basilica as\
  \ background. We slow down. A woman\u2019s voice announces the name of the station\
  \ as we arrive. My sister raises six fingers in my direction. I nod. A lady steps\
  \ into the subway car, a little boy holding tightly the hem of her long skirt. Her\
  \ chest expands as she breathes in and starts singing. We speed up.\n\nA man slid\
  \ a tiny window open, letting in a warm, thick breeze that did nothing to dissipate\
  \ the heat inside the passenger car. Squished between damp skin and heavy-looking\
  \ bags, I held my camera as close to me as I could, hoping no one would notice it\
  \ with my jacket wrapped around it. Faces rushed in and out, in between pushes and\
  \ grunts and nudges and cursing. A baby cried. Two men seemed to be yelling at each\
  \ other. Vendors hopped in selling candies and CDs and phone chargers, ten peso\
  \ coins passing from one hand to another. It seemed impossible for anyone else to\
  \ fit inside the car, but as the doors slid open, a mass of bodies flowed in, pushing\
  \ forcefully, trying not to get caught between the sliding doors. Still, a few did.\
  \  \n\nHer voice, almost tangible, fills the space around us, resonating with coarse\
  \ tenderness. I\u2019d say Carmen, if I had to guess. I hum along quietly. The boy\
  \ stares both at her and her newly-found audience intermittently, his eyes wide\
  \ open and expectant. I feel a slight tingle as her voice coils and uncoils around\
  \ my head. After a long, high-pitched vibrato, her lips meet once again, my palms\
  \ feeling the urge to do so as well. She just recently lost her job and is struggling\
  \ to find one, she says. Taking care of a child alone is not easy. Any help is more\
  \ than welcome. Silence falls over the car. A child grunts. Someone flips the page\
  \ of a book. I look around. People don\u2019t seem to have noticed the woman standing\
  \ in front of them. Nobody seems willing to help the woman. I don\u2019t know if\
  \ I should. I\u2019m not even sure I have any spare change on me right now. With\
  \ a pang of guilt, I watch as she hops off, her kid behind her, muttering a soft\
  \ merci! that lingers even after the doors have closed. We speed up once again.\n\
  \nA couple people are still stuck between the doors. They keep trying to push their\
  \ way in, even though they know there\u2019s no space for any more tired, sweaty\
  \ bodies inside. A short, plump policewoman approaches them and politely asks them\
  \ to climb off. They do so, and reaching the next station seems like quite an Odyssey.\
  \ On the way home, Montmartre lingers on my mind."
