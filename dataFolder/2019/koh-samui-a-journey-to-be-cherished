Text: "I\u2019ve travelled to Thailand thrice in my life and like always I didn\u2019\
  t expect any surprises. Expected the similar landscapes, beaches, night life and\
  \ the crowd until last year, June'18.\n\nMy first jaw dropping experience was the\
  \ airport of Koh Samui. The astounding airport of this place is a must see. So much\
  \ greenery around and the innovative architecture. \n\nThis place, located on the\
  \ gulf of Thailand, gave me the enthralling experiences during my 6 day's stay.\
  \ It'll remain etched in my memories. Be it the nostalgic cruise to Ang Thong marine\
  \ national park, the unforgettable debut in Kayaking with another Dutch traveller\
  \ who happened to become a really good friend on the ferry, the arduous climbs to\
  \ various view points or the wearisome drive through the hilly jungle tracks (oh,\
  \ I climbed the roof of the jeep during the drive). Every moment will remain as\
  \ cherished memories. \n\nTo my surprise, there isn\u2019t much of a night life\
  \ there like other places in Thailand. It was more of a laid back lifestyle with\
  \ a very few tourists which was perfect for me and I never expected that, Thailand\
  \ being such a touristic place. The restaurants usually used to close at 10 pm and\
  \ the bars by midnight. So, I usually ended up spending my time with my Dutch friend,\
  \ Jeroen on the beach after midnight and enjoyed the sea breeze and the sound of\
  \ the sea.\n\nI had started my trip strolling down the lanes of lamai centre, fondling\
  \ the goods on display and tasting the seafood at the local restaurants adjacent\
  \ to the open bars. I'd definitely recommend tasting the prawn and the squid dishes\
  \ there. While the girls pole danced to the raucous music, the fruit cocktails on\
  \ the streets (which was pretty unusual for me) calmed my thirst. The following\
  \ days included my cruise to the islands and the wonderful blue-green scenery around\
  \ me didn\u2019t fail to leave me spellbound. The windy weather was perfect and\
  \ made it easy for me to hike to a 500 metres uphill view point, only to find the\
  \ astounding uninhabited lagoon island called the \u201CEmerald Island\".\n\nIn\
  \ my wildest dreams, I had never imagined a place that existed where the monkeys\
  \ go to school. Well, this was the place! Koh Samui import monkeys and train them\
  \ in schools for 6 months and even award certificates on completion. It was amazing\
  \ to see these primates climbing up the trees fetching the coconuts and throwing\
  \ them down... perfectionists at work! This is the job they do day after day so\
  \ that the island can export millions of coconuts.\nI bid the monkeys goodbye after\
  \ quenching my thirst with fresh and sweet coconut water they fetched for me and\
  \ thus made my last experience of this place quite zestful."
