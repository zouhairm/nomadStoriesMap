Text: "I arrive at customs alone. Ushered forward, I walk slowly toward a screen,\
  \ a stern-faced man watching my approach, his moustache curled in a delicate, but\
  \ unmistakable frown. I grip my boarding pass a little tighter as I slide my passport\
  \ toward him. He reaches over without a smile. \n\n\u2018Where are you from?\u2019\
  \ he asks curtly.\n\n\u2018London.\u2019 \n\nI see his eyes flick down to check,\
  \ my brown skin at odds with my English accent. He pauses, then begins questioning,\
  \ each question faster than the next. Indignance prickles across my neck as I feel\
  \ the tone change, interrogating, trying to trip me up. I breathe deep, while the\
  \ small scribbled address on my palm smudges slightly with sweat. I lift my chin\
  \ defiantly and watch him as he assesses me. He stares a beat too long at my passport,\
  \ wordlessly handing it back. I am free to go.\n\nThis introduction to Canada wasn\u2019\
  t the friendly welcome I had envisaged. I had just travelled through the US, where\
  \ the foreigners are made to stand in lines with the words ALIENS emblazoned above\
  \ us. Unwelcoming and threatening was something I had associated with the gateway\
  \ to America, not its neighbours, famed for their extreme politeness and easy-going\
  \ attitude. \n\nAs I stood waiting for my friend at Toronto Pearson, I was struck\
  \ by my singularity; this experience, above all others, was the first time I had\
  \ felt truly alone whilst I had travelled. \n\nBut then a little girl wandered out\
  \ in front of me, her small chubby legs zigzagging her in all directions across\
  \ the smooth floor. A stuffed giraffe falls from her grip, and in her distraction,\
  \ she leaves it on the floor. I stoop to pick it up, brushing off the debris of\
  \ a thousand wheelie bags, and weave to catch her. By this time, she\u2019s reached\
  \ her parents, her mother frowning in confusion as the little girl wails her dismay\
  \ at losing her fluffy companion. I catch them, and hand her back her toy. She stops\
  \ crying at once, the puckered lines on her forehead smoothing into coos of delight.\
  \ I spot a lone tooth as she flashes me a shy grin. Her parents are immediately\
  \ bestowing their gratitude, and I laugh them off, with a casual \u2018it was nothing\u2019\
  .\n\nAll of a sudden, I feel less lonely. \n\nThroughout the week, I travel alone,\
  \ and yet, I never feel lonely. Just outside of Little Portugal, I eat Japanese\
  \ food with a Mexican couple, I wander through Old Town Toronto with an 86-year\
  \ old great-grandmothers recommendation safely documented on my phone, and I sit\
  \ on the banks of Toronto Island with a flock of ducks scattered by my feet. \n\n\
  On Friday evening as my bag lies packed by the front door, we group together at\
  \ the Drake Hotel, dancing in a single throbbing crowd, hips and arms moving as\
  \ one to the beat, the wave of bodies ebbing and flowing in time to the DJs whims.\
  \ A man gets up on stage, turning his back to the crowd, with the words TORONTO\
  \ VS EVERYBODY emblazoned across his back, to roars and cheers from the crowd. \n\
  \nWe stop for a farewell Tim Horton\u2019s coffee before I leave, heads heavy from\
  \ the two-hour sleep. When I get to the till the lady perks up at my accent.\n\n\
  \u2018Where are you from?\u2019\n\n\u2018London.\u2019\n\nHer face breaks into a\
  \ large grin. \u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to go.\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019d be happy\
  \ to have you.\u2019 I say."
