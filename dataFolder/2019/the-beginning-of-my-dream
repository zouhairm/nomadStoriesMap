Text: "Hello, my name is Bruna and I\u2019m from Brazil. I\u2019m 21 years old and\
  \ I work as a secretary at a real estate agency. I\u2019m also studying administration\
  \ at Feevale University, near to my city.\nMy first experience traveling was in\
  \ July 2018, when I won a scholarship for a summer course about business strategy.\
  \ It was in London. It was simply amazing.\nThe course lasted 3 weeks, but I spent\
  \ one month traveling in total. I live in a very little city, with only five thousand\
  \ inhabitants. Not only the fact that I was in a total different place, but also\
  \ the fact that I saw some stuff that I had never seen in my entire life, were reasons\
  \ enough to make me sure that travel, meet new places, and specially share my experiences\
  \ with everybody, it\u2019s something that I really want to do for the rest of my\
  \ life.\nAs it was my first time in another country, I wanted to know everything,\
  \ but specially the local customs. In my first day there, I went out to meet markets\
  \ and stores, I was surprised about how different these places are from Brazil.\n\
  As day go by, I went to meet more places like pubs and bars, and I grew more and\
  \ more admired, not only for the differentiated menu that was served, but mainly\
  \ by the way of being of people. Everybody was just so educated, and seemed to live\
  \ their own life on a special way.\nBesides pubs, supermarkets, markets and department\
  \ stores were also my favorite places to go. It\u2019s enchanting the way that everything\
  \ was organized, and the variety of products makes you not want to go home anymore.\n\
  Actually, London is not only about that, regardless of your age, of what do you\
  \ like to do, of what is your favorite music style, all the time, there is going\
  \ to have something interesting for you to do. There\u2019s a lot of theaters, movie\
  \ theaters, parks, concerts, different events happening at different times of the\
  \ year, and not to mention the attractions, like museums, and the main sights of\
  \ the city. \nI can\u2019t point my favorite place in London, there are so many\
  \ that I loved so much, but if I had to choose, I would choose two. The first one\
  \ is the Hyde Park, this park is just so amazing and there\u2019s so much to see\
  \ on it, I used to go there everyday. The second one it\u2019s not exactly the place,\
  \ but the moment, sitting in a bench with my friends, close to midnight, facing\
  \ Thames River, with an amazing view to London Eye, at a summer night, it was just\
  \ perfect. These are the kinds of moments that you will never forget in your entire\
  \ life. \nContinuing my journey, I spent a weekend in Scotland, I cannot explain\
  \ this place in words, it\u2019s surreal, everything there is different of everything\
  \ that I have ever seen in my whole life. I saw things that I only saw in pictures\
  \ and that I thought weren\u2019t even possible to be real. Amazing castles, old\
  \ and charming structures, lovely landscapes, furry cows and much more. The receptivity\
  \ of the place was also unbelievable, merchants are very friendly with tourists.\
  \ Again, it\u2019s a place that words can\u2019t explain. \nNow it\u2019s time to\
  \ end my journey. After spending for the first time in my life an entire month traveling,\
  \ all my family wanted to hear about everything. Not only my family, all my friends\
  \ were also amazed with all the stories, all the pictures, all the gifts, anyway,\
  \ everything that I brought with me. I came home with my bag full of amazing stuff,\
  \ but specially, full of experience that no one will never take away from me. \n\
  Now, the only certainty I have, is that a want to continue to go after my dream,\
  \ I want to travel around the world, meet new people, new cultures, new places,\
  \ but specially, I want to share it with my family, my friends, and with everybody\
  \ that has the same dream that I have."
