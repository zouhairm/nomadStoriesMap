Text: "I left Colombia as a teenager, thinking the rest of the world was a much better\
  \ place.\nI didn't return to this magical place until I was in my 40's, mostly because\
  \ once I settled in the United States and became a citizen, my desire to visit all\
  \ those countries that I grew up hearing about, had become an obsession. \nSo there\
  \ I was, laying on the beach in The Bahamas, Jamaica, Panama, Mexico or cruising\
  \ around the whole Florida Peninsula. \nOther adventures took me to Canada, Italy,\
  \ Germany, Czech Republic and Poland.\nIt was not until I felt like I was still\
  \ missing a stronger connection with nature, people and food during my vacations,\
  \ that I turned my eyes back to my native land.\nFrom the moment my American Airlines\
  \ flight started descending into Olaya Herrera International Airport in Medellin,\
  \ I could hardly contain my emotion. \nLarge patches of emerald green started to\
  \ peep out of the clouds as the jet started losing altitude and the view became\
  \ clearer with every second closer to my final destination.\nThe immigration process\
  \ took less time than in most other countries that I had visited for the past twenty\
  \ years, and everybody seemed so happy and full of life and purpose.\nThe next fifteen\
  \ days proved to be an amazing and very rewarding experience.\nAll the negative\
  \ opinions about Colombia that I was accustomed to reading and hearing about while\
  \ living in the U.S., suddenly clashed with the reality in front of my eyes.\nTaxi\
  \ drivers were eager to take me to my final destination, luggage carriers of all\
  \ ages offered their services to assist me for a small tip and everybody else seemed\
  \ to genuinely enjoy just being helpful, courteous and cordial.\nThe 27-minute ride\
  \ to my hotel was an interesting experience, watching all types of vehicles and\
  \ motorcycles weave in and out of traffic, cutting in front and around, but nobody\
  \ seemed to really care, much less resort to the road rage as the common response\
  \ that I'm so used to in my home state of Illinois. \nI guess the beautiful scenery\
  \ and the mild climate of Colombia plays a big role in the driving habits of its\
  \ citizens, even though  this remark may contradict its convoluted history during\
  \ the 80's and 90's, which is the main reason why this beautiful country is still\
  \ considered a forbidden destination.\nMy next few days were the stuff vacation\
  \ dreams are made of: starting with my ecological tour of Arvi Park, walking with\
  \ a group of six other people while our young guide would explain to us the most\
  \ minute details of the local flora and fauna, while two big groups of school children\
  \ passed us by, chattering and singing merrily.\nThe next day I was off to Guatape\
  \ and El Pe\xF1ol. I knew in advance that climbing stairs was a requirement for\
  \ visiting this majestic location, but I was not prepared for  one thousand of them,\
  \ all at once.\nHowever, after a couple of breaks during my ascent, and once I finally\
  \ reached the top of this titanic rock, I was rewarded with the most exquisite view\
  \ any mortal can find soothing to the eyes: like in a painting, placid brush strokes\
  \ of all shades of blue and emerald green extended as far as the eye can see, while\
  \ tiny colorful boats rip the peaceful waters down below.\nGuatape's pintoresque\
  \ facades and quiet life was like going back in time.\nSitting at the main plaza,\
  \ sipping Colombian coffee and talking to the caf\xE9 owner, proved to be a most\
  \ rewarding moment during my trip.\nMy next stops in the following days were the\
  \ magical town of El Jardin, the awe-inspiring hot springs resort Termales de Santa\
  \ Rosa de Cabal in the neighboring state of Risaralda and a visit to El Salto, which\
  \ generates electrical power to most of the area.\nI will elaborate more on these\
  \ locations on my next review of Colombia, but while flying back to the U.S., I\
  \ felt I had left a big piece if my heart in the magic of the Colombian Andes and\
  \ its warm and kind people."
