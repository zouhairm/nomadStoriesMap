Text: "I sat down, defeated, all alone in the thick of night. There was nothing around\
  \ me except the wild abandon of the Tanzanian mountains cloaked in a veil of darkness.\
  \ \u201CThis is a traveler\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201D I thought. I was stranded\
  \ in rural Tanzania in the middle of the night with no way to get home.\n\nHours\
  \ earlier, I had set off for Nyabugogo Bus Station in Kigali, ready to make the\
  \ trip to my petite village tucked into the lush hills of northwestern Tanzania.\
  \ I had made the trip countless times. Buses routinely left every half hour to the\
  \ Rusumo border, where I caught a taxi home. \n\n\u201CNext bus: 3pm,\u201D the\
  \ bus company attended announced. \u201C3pm?!\u201D I cried. \u201CThat\u2019s in\
  \ three hours.\u201D My chest tightened as I calculated the reality of reaching\
  \ home today. The trip should take four hours to the border barring any breakdowns.\
  \ And no one knew whether the border closed at 8pm Rwandan time or 8pm Tanzanian\
  \ time. \n\nThe bus finally pulled in at 3:30 pm, greeted by a mad mob pushing to\
  \ board. Lost in the throng of madness, I desperately waved my ticket in the bus\
  \ attendant\u2019s face. \n\nThe attendant scooted people and bags of rice around\
  \ to find a makeshift seat for me, where I situated myself between two young Rwandan\
  \ boys, their eyes wide as they stared at me. Angry shouts of \u201Cmzungu\u201D\
  \ reverberated as the bus departed the station. The white person had gotten the\
  \ last seat. \n\nWe bumped along the red dirt roads, cutting through terraced farms\
  \ and banana plantations until at long last we arrived at the border.  \n\nThe last\
  \ lights faded into the distance as I walked away from Rwanda and towards Tanzania.\
  \ The two kilometer walk stretched for miles. In daylight, this walk bypassed luscious\
  \ waterfalls and verdant mountains. I trudged through the jungle, cloaked in a foreboding\
  \ darkness, accompanied only by the roar of the rushing river. With each step, I\
  \ imagined someone lurking behind me. \n\nFinally! The outline of a tin shack\u2014\
  the Tanzanian border post\u2014loomed in the distance. \n\n\u201CAsante sana!\u201D\
  \ I exclaimed in gratitude, grabbing my stamped passport back from behind barred\
  \ windows. I was almost home. I spun around to the usually bustling taxi stand to\
  \ find an empty dirt field. \u201CWhere are the taxis?\u201D my mind raced. \n\n\
  The only building in sight was a makeshift aluminum bar dimly lit by a single bulb,\
  \ from which Tanzanian men spilled out, sloshing bottles of Kilimanjaro beers. The\
  \ only vehicle was a motorcycle belonging to a stout man more than a few drinks\
  \ in. \n\n\u201CUnakwenda Ngara? Dola mia moja,\u201D he slurred. For a ripe price\
  \ of $100, he offered to drive me home down unlit, unpaved roads. Not a chance.\
  \ The otherwise empty street pulsed under the rhythm of Afrobeat tunes. \n\nDefeated,\
  \ I walked down the single road, which quickly disappeared into the dark hills.\
  \ \n\nSuddenly, lights shone into my tear-streaked face. I looked up to face a massive\
  \ truck.\n\n\u201CWhere are you going? Why are you here alone this time of night?\u201D\
  \ a deep voice stopped me in my tracks. \u201CDo you need a ride?\u201D \n\nI blubbered\
  \ my sob story, already clambering up the tall steps into the truck, my mind blank,\
  \ body trembling.\n\nA prayer carpet adorned the floor. A crescent moon and star\
  \ hung from the ceiling. I didn\u2019t know what to make of these details. What\
  \ had I gotten myself into? A single woman alone in a truck with three men. This\
  \ was my worst travelling nightmare. \n\nTwo hours passed impossibly slowly as the\
  \ truck curved around mountain passes. My sweaty hands clutched onto my bag while\
  \ every worst possible scenario raced through my mind. I was alone, vulnerable,\
  \ and completely at the mercy of three strangers. \n\nAt long last the truck began\
  \ to pass familiar sights and descend into the valley where I lived. Before long,\
  \ I was tumbling out of the truck onto my front porch, shaken and in awe. \n\n\u201C\
  Good night! And next time, don\u2019t cross the border after dark.\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ truck slowly pulled away, leaving me standing alone again. Yet now, the dark felt\
  \ a little bit lighter, penetrated by the unexpected kindness of strangers."
