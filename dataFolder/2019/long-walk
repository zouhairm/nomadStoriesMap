Text: "Im a south indian guy  from TN.First time i travelled towards the north.A complete\
  \ changeover of atmosphere new language,food and people.Actually i went to attend\
  \ an interview but my main purpose is to explore the city.The place i went is allahabad\
  \ (prayagraj).I stayed nearly 10days. The day before only 2.0 movie got released.So\
  \ day 1 of my stay in allahabad i saw the film in one theatre.After the movie went\
  \ to the triveni sangam favorite spot of tourist.There you can see the meeting of\
  \ three rivers from three different direction.And im not interested in any spirtual\
  \ kind of activity so i skiped visting the temples.\n         One thing i felt bad\
  \ is transportation,here we cant see buses or local trains.Battery auto and cab\
  \ is the transportation available in that place.So morning i used battery auto to\
  \ roam the streets and places.And night i choosed to walk to see the places.Day\
  \ 2 i covered most of the places popular for food.Like, \"Eat on \" for Briyani\
  \  \"Bikernwala\" and \"pandit ki\" for chat MG margh road for street food. If you\
  \ are from south and never ever visited any north indian city then you can feel\
  \ the newness of the surroundings.\n Im from chennai famous for super hot and many\
  \ more things.But the 10 days stay in allahabad i rarely felt the sunlight because\
  \ daytime was pretty low. There was place called civil lines you will feel the peace\
  \ there. I stayed 4days in that place it more like hifi area.After staying here\
  \ you can feel the different expericence when you walk from Allahabad railway station\
  \ to chowk through Dr.KN katju road.The two kind of lifestyle you can see.what i\
  \ experienced in this 10 days is different kind of people and diversities in my\
  \ own country through the walk i made in every night."
