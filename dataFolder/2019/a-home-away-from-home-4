Text: "I consider myself to be somewhat of a social butterfly, happily flitting between\
  \ strangers and making conversation wherever I go. There is; however, one social\
  \ situation that gets the heart racing and palms sweating like no other, and that\u2019\
  s meeting a boyfriend\u2019s family for the first time. Leading up to it your head\
  \ fills with irrational fears of accidentally spitting food at them whilst eating,\
  \ or painting yourself to be a social pariah through forgetting how to form sentences.\
  \ In my case the latter wasn\u2019t an unreasonable concern, as I was about to be\
  \ thrown into a situation where there was no common language for us to speak and\
  \ I was suddenly bereft of my best tool for communication. \n\nShortly after we\
  \ met in Vienna, Milan moved back to the Czech Republic, but for me there was a\
  \ certain romance in having to cross borders to see each other, not to mention the\
  \ opportunity to become properly acquainted with the hearty delights of their traditional\
  \ cuisine. After a frantic Czech crash course on the three hour coach journey, I\
  \ was in Olomouc. The city was particularly beautiful by night and thanks to its\
  \ abundance of impressive churches and astronomical clock, it is fondly thought\
  \ of as a tourist-free baby sibling of Prague. \n\nHaving arrived at a stereotypical\
  \ bus station - grey, decaying, with slight wafts of aromas you\u2019d rather not\
  \ remember - I was excited to be dropped off in front of a charmingly honey-coloured\
  \ house surrounded by immaculate white fencing. I don\u2019t know what expectations\
  \ I\u2019d had of Czech houses, but this had already exceeded all of them. I was\
  \ drawn towards the smell of freshly fried schnitzel and sizzling steaks and walking\
  \ into the kitchen, I found Milan\u2019s parents Petr and Ag\xE1ta eagerly working\
  \ away over a hot stove. Witnessing Petr\u2019s attention to detail was fascinating\
  \ and I watched intrigued as he chided his son\u2019s method of throwing the steak\
  \ into the pan, telling him instead to let the pan heat first and then gently place\
  \ it into the melting butter. Despite not understanding a word of his instructions,\
  \ his animated way of speaking and elaborate hand gestures were sufficient enough\
  \ that I refer to them every time that I cook myself a steak. \n\nAt the dinner\
  \ table working out who could communicate with whom was mental gymnastics in itself.\
  \ Milan was the only one of us who could communicate fluently with everybody; my\
  \ lack of Czech meant that I spoke in German with his mother, smatterings of English\
  \ with his father, and his sister Barbara was so shy that our conversation was limited\
  \ to friendly smiles. Ag\xE1ta was the chattiest of the family, and instead of relying\
  \ on her German, she spoke to me in Czech, glanced at Milan for his translation\
  \ into English and then watched for my response. As a languages student, communicating\
  \ across languages is something that I\u2019m accustomed to, but this was an entirely\
  \ different ball game. The humour and eloquence that I took for granted in English\
  \ had been reduced into facial expressions and hand gestures. \n\nAs we delved into\
  \ the meticulously created dishes, Milan\u2019s father jumped up from the table,\
  \ seeming to have forgotten something. His hurried explanation in Czech caused my\
  \ boyfriend to roll his eyes and piqued my interest as I watched him hurry to the\
  \ CD player. After briefly searching his music collection he pulled out the album\
  \ that he was looking for, slid it into the disc drive and watched me for my response.\
  \ The dining room was suddenly alive with the sound of 18th century classical music,\
  \ not unlike that found in Pride and Prejudice. I couldn\u2019t help but grin as\
  \ Milan\u2019s father summed it up in the statement of: \u2018England!\u2019 \n\n\
  Petr resumed his place at the head of the table and I smiled at the bizarreness\
  \ of the situation. We continued to enjoy the food and chat across languages to\
  \ the blaring sound of England from centuries ago, and I can honestly say that despite\
  \ being unable to speak, I have never felt so welcome in somebody else\u2019s home."
