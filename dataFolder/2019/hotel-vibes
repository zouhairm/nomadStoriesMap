Text: "I was a cabin crew so that is why I had many chances to explore various cities.\
  \ Since I was an interior architect and graphic designer before becoming a cabin\
  \ crew, I still have an eye view on design, architecture and art. The layover cities\
  \ were always interesting to walk around and get lost in. Although it mostly was\
  \ 24-hour layover, I always found the way to explore the city within the limited\
  \ time. I had a great journey in each exploration; moreover, the great chance to\
  \ stay in many hotels from different cities. The hotel became a part of my journey\
  \ as a cabin crew. Since I had my own new temporary space around the world where\
  \ I could create it from many things in my suitcase, I discovered that exploring\
  \ in each hotel from different cities created the great journey as remarkable as\
  \ exploring the layover city itself.\n\nChecking in and out all the time, I slightly\
  \ noticed something within hotel\u2019s space. Exploring gradually, I found 3 ways\
  \ of action, which are: approach, stay, and sense. These actions led me into an\
  \ unexpected discovery in hotel vibes.\n\nApproach: visually, physically, and mentally\
  \ greeting\nWhile approaching to the hotel\u2019s space, you might not notice that\
  \ the hotel has already started greeting whether from the hotel\u2019s name sign\
  \ or the doorman who eagerly come to greet and guide you. However, sometimes the\
  \ doorman is not there waiting to welcome you. You automatically know exactly where\
  \ to go due to the designed hotel\u2019s circulation that guides your perception\
  \ of space. Your brain knows it instantly; you walk directly. This is the very first\
  \ introduction of the conversation between you and the hotel\u2019s space. How the\
  \ first feeling approaches and guides you is how the conversation between you and\
  \ the hotel\u2019s space will be. The conversation between you and the hotel might\
  \ not be heard, but it is resonant and clear inside you head. Would it be casual\
  \ or formal? It all starts from here. Approaching into the hotel\u2019s space, your\
  \ journey starts visually, physically, and mentally.\n\nStay: living, resting, adapting\
  \ one\u2019s lifestyle\nYour hotel room becomes your own new temporary space once\
  \ you unlock your suitcase. The hotel\u2019s space has already designed by hotel\u2019\
  s core concept. Your room amenity might be designed by hotel\u2019s geographical\
  \ or cultural factor. For example, the hotel in Narita, Japan is where there is\
  \ prepared Yukata in your room instead of bathrobe so you would be able to go for\
  \ Onsen spa, or the hotel in Dubai, UAE is where there are water bottles in every\
  \ corner because it is hotel\u2019s complimentary in order to keep you away from\
  \ dehydrating. Once you step in hotel\u2019s public space, it might be steakhouse,\
  \ rooftop pool or Onsen spa. These are lifestyle that hotel intends to provide your\
  \ new experience while staying. While living in provided facilities, I rest in my\
  \ own new temporary space where I can adjust my lifestyle to fit in the whole new\
  \ experience from hotel\u2019s lifestyle. \n\nSense: feel it subconsciously, remember\
  \ it eternally\nApart from physically experience that you have, there is another\
  \ dimension of experience that you have subconsciously. The hotel\u2019s aroma is\
  \ filled in the air by designed scent or hotel\u2019s design materials. It is something\
  \ that you might not notice; however, your brain recognizes it instantly. Memorizing\
  \ this experience through the hotel\u2019s aroma, you might be wakened to recognize\
  \ it again when you sense it someday after. This sense that you perceive remains\
  \ eternally without noticing because of the air that you breathe. Even if you can\
  \ sometimes control yourself not to see or not to hear, you can\u2019t completely\
  \ control yourself not to breathe while you are living. As a result, this underlying\
  \ sense of space lasts.\n\nThe pattern of staying in the hotel becomes clear when\
  \ I collected each detail while I was staying in each hotel little by little. It\
  \ is something that I didn\u2019t expect when I was in Paris, Beijing or Frankfurt.\
  \ I\u2019d rather think of exploring Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of China, and\
  \ Rom\xEBrberg. However, every moment that I spent in each hotel turned out to be\
  \ noteworthy, which it was discovered unexpectedly."
