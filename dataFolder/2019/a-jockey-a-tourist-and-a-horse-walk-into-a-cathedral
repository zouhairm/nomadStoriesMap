Text: "You can feel the early morning momentum beginning to build. Scooters whiz by\
  \ as commuters set off for work. Shop owners sweep their stoops and hum along to\
  \ the Laura Pausini song that pours melodically through the radio. Retired men swap\
  \ stories over coffee, newspapers and freshly rolled cigarettes. It\u2019s Thursday\
  \ in Siena, Italy. \n\nOn this particular morning, however, every single molecule\
  \ of air is electrified. The unforgiving July sun beats down as streets begin to\
  \ swell with swarms of spectators flocking to the city center in excited anticipation.\
  \ \n\nBeing a foreign student who spent the past six weeks absorbing as much knowledge\
  \ about Italian culture as I could, I am well-aware of the occasion. Today is the\
  \ day of the Palio. \n\nHistorical records indicate the first Palio horse races\
  \ took place as early as the 6th century when Siena was divided into 59 neighborhoods,\
  \ or \u201Ccontrade\u201D. Today, only 17 remain. Ancient alliances and rivalries\
  \ between these neighborhoods, having endured the passing of time without losing\
  \ gravity, reignite in the days preceding the Palio and personify the historical\
  \ manifestation from start to finish. Fabrizio, my host dad, insists that I root\
  \ for \u201CL\u2019Onda,\u201D the contrada where he was born and raised. I happily\
  \ oblige. \n\nThe impassioned event fittingly takes place in the heart of Siena:\
  \ the Piazza del Campo. The iconic piazza is the focal point from which eleven avenues\
  \ emerge and wind their way toward the city walls until they ultimately blend into\
  \ the surrounding landscape of rolling hills and lush countryside. \n\nThe preparations\
  \ that precede the Palio, in classic Italian fashion, are slow and methodical. A\
  \ dense layer of earth is deposited in the piazza while the notorious \u201CCurva\
  \ di San Martino\u201D is lined with mattresses to prevent the race-ending injuries\
  \ that occur when eager jockeys take the dangerous corner too sharply. \n\nJockeys\
  \ and horses are celebrated like heroes. I duck inside a chapel to watch a Catholic\
  \ priest bless a racehorse who stands valiantly upon an opulent alter, donning orange\
  \ and green in a noble representation of the \u201CSelva\u201D contrada. \n\nI merge\
  \ back into the mighty throng as it flows toward the impending spectacle.\n\nInside\
  \ the arena, I admire a splendid display of colors as decorative flags soar and\
  \ twirl to the tune of beating drums, trumpeting horns and baritone echoes of the\
  \ bell that rings from atop the \u201CTorre di Mangia\u201D.\n\nSome 30,000 pairs\
  \ of eyes look on from balconies that line the piazza in prestigious seats that\
  \ were purchased a year in advance for a handsome fee. Meanwhile I\u2019ve got the\
  \ best, and most precarious, \u201Cseat\u201D in the house, packed in the center\
  \ of the piazza among an additional 30,000 fervent onlookers. \n\nSuddenly, a bullet\
  \ is fired and the Palio is on. Deafening cheers erupt from the enthusiastic crowd\
  \ and consume me for 75 surreal seconds. \n\nInside those ancient city walls, with\
  \ each tread of powerful hoof, we are transported further back in time. I absorb\
  \ the scene that unfolds around me as captivated spectators, cheering hysterically\
  \ and pumping their fists into the air, unknowingly mirror their ancestors who presumably\
  \ performed the same actions centuries ago. \n\nOne, two, three frenzied laps around\
  \ the piazza and, as instantaneously as it had begun, the Palio is over. The victorious\
  \ jockey bursts across the finish line, and the day belongs to the \u201CTorre\u201D\
  \ contrada. Exuberant Torre leaders claim the prestigious \u201CDrappellone\u201D\
  \ and proceed to a lively celebration in the streets. \n\nI return, dazed and delighted,\
  \ to my homestay where Fabrizio informs me that coming in second, as his beloved\
  \ Onda had, is more devastating than coming in last. The mood lightens over plates\
  \ of warm pasta as we set our sights toward our righteous vindication in next year\u2019\
  s Palio. \n\n\u201CQuello che siamo stati, quello che siamo, quello che saremo,\u201D\
  \ Fabrizio leads us in a toast, which roughly translates to \u201Cthat which we\
  \ were, that which we are, that which we will be.\u201D These serendipitous words\
  \ are the perfect summation of a day spent with one foot in the past and one in\
  \ the present. I raise a generous glass of Chianti Classico to my lips."
