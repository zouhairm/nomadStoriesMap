Text: "On my backpacking trip across Colombia, I hadn\u2019t expected to find a modern-day\
  \ Don Quixote. But there he was, fighting for his ideal vision of the world, in\
  \ the tiny, obscure village of Zapatoca.\n\nChance got me there.\n\nMy friend Sophie\
  \ and I had been touring in the north-eastern province of Santander, known for adventure\
  \ sports and \u2018hormigas culonas\u2019 - literally \u2018big-bottomed ants\u2019\
  \ -  a fried delicacy of the region. When we heard about a village in the Andes\
  \ that offered spectacular views of the Chicamocha canyon, one of the world\u2019\
  s largest, we were intrigued. \n\nAfter a long and bumpy ride along winding country\
  \ roads, we reached Zapatoca late in the evening. Early next morning, Sophie and\
  \ I hiked up to the viewpoint - Mirador Los Guanes. On a clear day, they say one\
  \ can see the place where the Suarez and Chicamocha rivers join to form the\nSogamoso\
  \ river. But when we got up there, the clouds were low and we could only vaguely\
  \ make out the confluence of the rivers. With nothing else to do, we decided to\
  \ explore the village instead. \n\nDescending into Zapatoca, I felt transported\
  \ to the 18th century, when the village was founded by Spanish conquistadors. The\
  \ charming central square, the main church and town hall, looked as they might have\
  \ 300 years ago. Classic Spanish houses, with white walls and clay-tiled roofs,\
  \ radiated in neat rows from all sides of the square. \n\nIn one such house converted\
  \ into a restaurant, we sat down for a lunch of roasted chicken and rice. That\u2019\
  s where we saw a poster of the \u2018House of Quixote\u2019 museum. We asked our\
  \ waiter about it. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a tribute to Don Quixote,\u201D he said,\
  \ referring to the Spanish knight-errant who fought imaginary battles to right the\
  \ wrongs of the world. The waiter offered to take us to the the museum. \n\nAfter\
  \ our meal, Sophie and I followed him down the road until he stopped at a house\
  \ and rang the bell. We were perplexed when the woman who opened the door, bowed\
  \ to him. He then introduced himself \u2014 Rodrigo Esp\xEDndola, owner of the museum\
  \ and the restaurant where we had eaten.\nHe offered to guide us through the House\
  \ of Quixote. \n\n\u201CQuixote is a universally recognized personality who always\
  \ fought for justice,\u201D Esp\xEDndola explained his fascination for the character\
  \ penned by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes in the 1600s. \n\nIn the museum's\
  \ first room, we saw a miniature sculpture of Quixote with his squire Sancho Panza,\
  \ both on their horses, wielding their lances, to fend off enemes that surrounded\
  \ them from all sides. The enemy in this case: flags of major multinational countries\
  \ like Coca Cola, McDonalds, and Disney. \n\u201CQuijote and Sancho represent humankind\
  \ \u2014 all of us \u2014 who are confronting large companies that constantly want\
  \ us to buy goods and services that we often don\u2019t need,\u201D said Esp\xED\
  ndola. \u201CThis sculpture invites viewers to think about excessive consumption\
  \ of today,\u201D he said. \n\nHearing Esp\xEDndola came as a relief, for he had\
  \ put into words something I had been mulling over lately. As a backpacker, I had\
  \ spent the last four months happily with just a handful of clothes and a few possessions.\
  \ Occasionally, I had found myself questioning if that large wardrobe of clothes\
  \ and shoes back home were really needed to make me happy?\n\nIn another miniature,\
  \ Quijote and Sancho looked on at a guillotine where the executioner prepared to\
  \ behead a man. In place of the blade, there was a credit card. \u201CThis is an\
  \ invitation for people to rationalize their spending, and not fall into debt traps\
  \ by pending money they dont have,\u201D said Esp\xEDndola.\n\nIn more than a dozen\
  \ such miniatures, Esp\xEDndola, 60 years old, has brought Quixote to confront what\
  \ he believes are problems of the 21st century. A walk through the museum was like\
  \ walking through my own life, forcing me to analyze my relationship not only with\
  \ consumption, but with the environment and the planet.\n\nAs the tour ended, it\
  \ dawned on me:  from his little corner of the world, Esp\xEDndola was fighting\
  \ to save his ideal vision of the world, trying to save us from ourselves.\n\nA\
  \ real-life Don Quixote?\n--"
