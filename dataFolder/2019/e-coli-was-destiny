Text: "I was new to traveling, only having been to Australia and Hawaii, and twelve\
  \ hours away from home back in eastern Canada. But I was ready to embrace the nomadic\
  \ lifestyle after a transformative year working and traveling in Australia, my first\
  \ time out of the country, and my first time traveling solo. It was incredibly rewarding.\
  \ My oldest friend caught my travel fever, and we planned to spend a couple months\
  \ in south east Asia. \n\nBut the chance to break my prejudiced view on backpacking\
  \ south east Asia, to learn there was more than Full Moon parties, scamming monkeys,\
  \ and real (but risky) spicy food was not meant to take place yet. For one, my supposed\
  \ travel buddy had gone totally AWOL, and for another reason, I went through all\
  \ my savings during what was supposed to be a quick mountain trip in Nepal and turned\
  \ into a prolonged, painful, and positive experience that the universe simply required\
  \ that I have. \n\nSo instead of feeling the rubbish between my toes at the beaches\
  \ of Bali,  I found myself in Nepal, with my boyfriend I\u2019d met in Australia\
  \ at my last job that I acquired by sheer luck (at the time it was unclear to me\
  \ that breaking down on the Nullarbor was a good thing). I knew nothing of the country,\
  \ except that it was known to be very poor, with the happiest of people, and home\
  \ to the Himalayan mountains. With the comfort of traveling with someone who\u2019\
  d been to both Asian and third world countries before, I was game.\n\n I prided\
  \  myself in traveling alone and making my way, but I was quickly aware of how much\
  \ easier and probably safer it was to have landed in Kathmandu eleven at night with\
  \ someone familiar to greet me. Anybody could have been a taxi driver, charging\
  \ whatever they pleased, and dropped me off at any unsigned building assuming to\
  \ be my hotel on any unsigned street. \u201CIs this my hotel?\u201D I would have\
  \ asked doubtfully. \u201CYes, please\u201D, they would have most likely replied.\
  \ But none of that scared me, because I wasn\u2019t alone. And I was here for the\
  \ mountains; everything else was peculiar and entertaining. \n\nBut after the mountains,\
  \ and a whole month of feeling ill and praying for a western toilet after 7 days\
  \ in the Annapurna region, I came to the realization that I would soon be staying\
  \ another month, alone. My Australian visa had not yet been granted, and it wasn\u2019\
  t sensible to waste two non-refundable flights. But even had I had my visa, there\
  \ was no way I was getting on that plane. I was too sick. My boyfriend left ruefully,\
  \ and gave me a wad of rupees and told me to get myself to a hospital. So I did,\
  \ where the cab driver stayed with me for the night until the owner of the house\
  \ I was to be staying at took over. Both of them communicated with the doctors and\
  \ ran the errands for my test results and payments. I was grateful, and caught off\
  \ guard to be receiving such kindness and patience by strangers.\n\nThe test results\
  \ came and revealed I had E. coli. Of the twelve pills I took for the next week,\
  \ one of them cured me, and the others helped with all the side effects.  I was\
  \ healthy again, but afraid to now venture Nepal on my own. So I stayed in that\
  \ house for the remaining month, eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner with the family\
  \ and other guests which all passed in my life as unique characters and stories.\
  \ I watched how the family went about their days, working slowly, humming or chanting,\
  \ greeting guests with big smiles, always smiling, and serving up meals to die for.\
  \ I helped with preparing meals eventually and contributed to three festivals. At\
  \ first I stayed out of fear of becoming ill in Kathmandu, but at some point I stayed\
  \ simply because I was content. \n\nThose two months were incomparable. The first\
  \ was something any tourist could have lived. The second, although it took E. coli\
  \ to restrain me, was a month that will last me a lifetime."
