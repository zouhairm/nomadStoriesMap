Text: "I went to Mali via Senegal in order to tick a box. The I\u2019ve \u2018travelled/been\
  \ to a developing world country\u2019 box. My sister had done Cuba and Mexico when\
  \ she was 19. My friends had done China, Ghana, Thailand. But no one had done Mali.\
  \ Or Senegal. I was living in New York City at the time, working as a PA to a film\
  \ Director and his family. His wife said to me, \u2018but Aaafrica? Why do you wanna\
  \ go to Afffrica?\u2019. As if I was mad. She was from poor Mexican stock but she\u2019\
  d become a very wealthy Upper West Side Jew thanks to her marriage. I thought it\
  \ was an odd question. I\u2019d been to South Africa. How would this be any different?\
  \ \n\nI flew via Casablanca. How odd as I sat there, waiting for many hours. This\
  \ is a real place. And it\u2019s nothing like the movie. \nI sat waiting: frustrated.\
  \ Little did I know that I was journeying into a new reality where time, to quote\
  \ one of the drivers I would meet, was \u2018elastic\u2019.\n\nFinally I arrived\
  \ in Dhakar, Senegal, for this is where my epic journey to Timbuktu and back would\
  \ begin. My friend\u2019s flat was basic but clean. There was no hot water. I was\
  \ horrified. She looked at me oddly. \u2018It\u2019s really not a big deal here.\
  \ I am lucky to have a good shower\u2019. She had lived there for a year. I was\
  \ a princess. Relatively speaking. I had a lot to learn. \n\nWe set off. With nothing\
  \ but a guidebook. I told my family I might call them once a month because there\
  \ were no phones to be had and we would be off grid so to speak.\nEveryday we would\
  \ turn up in a different town and everyday we would hope to find food (there wasn\u2019\
  t much to be had) and somewhere to lay our heads. We always found somewhere. We\
  \ often shared one meal a day. And the rest of the time ate bread and mangos. They\
  \ were damn fine mangoes but sometimes you can have too much of a good thing....\n\
  \nThe rest of the time what did we do? We talked and we experienced. The landscape\
  \ was incredible but tough. We travelled to the mud mosque at Djenn\xE9 which every\
  \ year gets washed away with the rains and is then rebuilt by hand by its people.\
  \ And we were given access to the Dogon tribes and the women who work work work\
  \ for their families. Carrying water on their heads and children on their backs.\
  \ And the men, so desperate for Western promise, whilst the women just looked us\
  \ up and down. We\u2019ve seen your kind before. Nothing to see here. On your way.\
  \ \n\nAnd so we \u2018moved on\u2019. Packed up our rucksacks every new day. On\
  \ to the next adventure. To meet two girls from Holland and New Zealand. To join\
  \ up and venture to our final destination. Timbuktu. The place that isn\u2019t a\
  \ figment of a myth. But a dusty Saharan former beauty. Now fallen.\nNo access to\
  \ the library for us Western Women. But instead a magical ride on some camels. Tea\
  \ with The Tuaregs and a night in the Sahara under the sand. Where we watched children\
  \ roll happily in its magical warmth. And I realised, they\u2019ve never had is\
  \ so good. And they\u2019ve got \u2018nothing.\u2019 \nBut \u2018nothing\u2019 is\
  \ in the eye of the beholder.\nAnd all that nothing, those limitless piles of golden\
  \ sand was almost as good as I or they, or anyone was ever going to get. True appreciation\
  \ for the glory of our natural world. And I only had to go to Timbuktu and back\
  \ to figure it out..."
