Text: "Japan lived up to every expectation I had and more. Exiting customs, the first\
  \ thing that greeted me was a TV crew looking to interview tourists on why they\
  \ had come to Japan.\n\nThroughout my stay in japan, I had a surreal (but enjoyable)\
  \ feeling as if I was playing Pokemon in real life, and couldn\u2019t really shake\
  \ it.\n\nI arrived late into Tokyo, so went for a quick bowl of ramen before ascending\
  \ the Tokyo skytree, the tallest building in Japan and second tallest in the world.\
  \ After being ushered into a lift that fires you 53 storeys in 20 seconds I was\
  \ met by the twinkling lights of the Tokyo skyline sprawling out en masse in every\
  \ direction. First taste of Tokyo, and it was a good one. \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ I set about to get as much of Tokyo in as possible. My hostel was near to the\
  \ Asakusa area, a traditional area of Tokyo which contains the Sensoji temple, so\
  \ I headed there first. Bustling markets and stalls led the way to this magnificent\
  \ Buddhist temple with the smell of incense radiating the air and the clatter of\
  \ coins being dropped into donation boxes.\n\nI then spent a good few hours having\
  \ a gander at the arcades of Tokyo in the Ikebukuro district. Every arcade game\
  \ imaginable resides here with whole floors given to different types of games. There\
  \ are also rows upon rows of capsule toy dispensers, the strangest of which I saw\
  \ dispensed a mini replica of itself.\n\nThen to get some more ramen and gyoza for\
  \ dinner before stumbling upon the small streets of the Golden Gai in Shinjuku.\
  \ These 6 streets contain rows of small pubs where foreigners are invited\nto come\
  \ in and have a drink with locals and other travellers.\n\nThe next day I had a\
  \ half day in Tokyo before heading to the mountain area of Hakone near Mt Fuji.\
  \ I spent the morning in the Shinjuku VR centre, a place where you can experience\
  \ the latest in VR games. The highlight of these were VR mario kart  and a horror\
  \ game in which you spend your time trying to escape a haunted hospital full of\
  \ zombies. \n\nI then had my first experience of the Shinkansen- Japan\u2019s bullet\
  \ trains which fire you from city to city at 200 mph . After the Shinkansen and\
  \ a long funicular rail journey, I arrived at my hostel in the mountain region of\
  \ Hakone. I quickly headed to the hostels onsen- a Japanese hot spring for some\
  \ relaxation, before getting some sleep for the next day. \n\nAfter a quick breakfast\
  \ and early start, I headed up the hillside via cable car to see an almost unbelievable\
  \ view of Mount Fuji. One solitary cloud resting on its navel, giving it the perfect\
  \ postcard look. I probably spent too long exploring the wilderness in the mountains,\
  \ but it was too good not to- and I got the perfect shot of Mt Fuji . Another cable\
  \ car ride before a picturesque pretend-pirate- boat across Lake Aki. Followed by\
  \ a journey through the Cedar Road- rows of ancient trees that Japanese traders\
  \ used to travel. Finally, I had to see the Hakone Shrine in the forest before running\
  \ back to catch the last Shinkansen to Kyoto.\n\nKyoto -as well as an anagram of\
  \ Tokyo- is also Japan\u2019s most historic city. The old capital has scores of\
  \ ancient temples, old cobbled streets and the timeless Nijo castle- home of the\
  \ shogun rulers and also Japan\u2019s emperor for a while. I spent almost all of\
  \ my days in kyoto running around to visit temples, including Kinkakuji (the golden\
  \ temple) and Tenryuji- a picturesque temple next to an amazing bamboo forest. The\
  \ highlight for me was Fushimi Inari Taisha, a series of red gates running up the\
  \ hills of Mount Inari. The red gates are donated as an offering to the god Inari-\
  \  the Fox god of agriculture/industry in traditional Japanese folklore. Food in\
  \ Kyoto, like the rest of Japan was sensational, I ate amazing mackerel sushi as\
  \ well as a traditional meal of soba  overlooking the Togetsu bridge in the rain.\n\
  \nMy answer on why Japan?\n\nFood \U0001F60B and Mt. Fuji"
