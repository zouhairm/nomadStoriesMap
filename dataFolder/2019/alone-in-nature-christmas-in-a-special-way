Text: "The telephone on the other end has been passed onto different people. No one\
  \ could understand me. Finally Nuno is on the phone and speaks decent English. I\
  \ explain him that I want to go to a beach to celebrate Christmas. It is the 23th\
  \ December and I am hitch-hiking around Portugal.  I have no idea where to go, just\
  \ aiming for a nice and quite beach, following the flow to see where I will end\
  \ up. \nBefore I spoke to Nuno, I tried to explain my plans to Waldo, the driver\
  \ of the car in which I am sitting. However we could not understand each other,\
  \ so he got out his phone and called his daughter. She spoke some English but did\
  \ not get my idea of celebrating Christmas alone. So she passed the phone onto Nuno.\
  \ Even he needed some time to understand that I do not want to get to a specific\
  \ village. After some exhausting explaining he gets my plan, but calls me crazy.\
  \ \nI give the phone back to the driver, Nuno and the driver are talking for some\
  \ minutes, than I get to talk to Nuno again. He says, Waldo can bring me to Nazare,\
  \ a beautiful town at the sea, nice beaches, big waves, a lot of surfers and in\
  \ summer hot girls. That\xB4s what he said. \n\nThe sun is about to set when I arrive\
  \ in Nazare. The promenade is full of locals and tourists who are strolling along\
  \ the beach. The place is amazing, high cliffs go far into the sea on one side,\
  \ on the other side there sand as far as one can see, in the back the houses are\
  \ build on the slope and reach all the way to the top of the hill. In front of me\
  \ there is the infinity of the sea. It is beautiful but anything but quiet. There\
  \ is no other option for me than to walk away from the crowd. \n\nIt takes me some\
  \ hours, I pass the end of the promenade, I keep going and leave the harbour behind\
  \ me. I walk more inland and pitch up my tent for the night. In the morning I walk\
  \ back to the sea again. And there it is. A beach. One of the prettiest I have ever\
  \ seen and no humans at all. I keep walking till I find two pallets which are going\
  \ to be my chair and table I decide. That is the place where I  will celebrate Christmas.\
  \ It is the 24th of December, back home in Germany, this is one of the most stressful\
  \ days of the year. Everybody is running around trying to get the last presents\
  \ and huge amounts of food for the Christmas days. Instead of hustling around the\
  \ city I just sit on a pallet, which the waves have washed up, looking out to the\
  \ sea somewhere in Portugal. It is surprisingly warm, the sun is strong and also\
  \ warms up my mind. I am watching the sun moving slowly across the clear blue sky\
  \ till it slowly sets behind the sea. It leaves this beautiful mix of red, orange\
  \ and yellow colours behind. The sky is burning. And so am I. I am burning of excitement\
  \ and happiness. At the same time I am as calm as never before. The place is so\
  \ peaceful and quite. It has a huge impact on me. The next day I start with a short\
  \ bath in the salty water. The rest of the day I spend watching the sea, sitting\
  \ on my pallet and observe how the waves are coming in, how they slowly build up\
  \ and try to stay up as long as possible and eventually collapse with this nice\
  \ tremendous sound. The white water is splashing around. \nOut of nowhere a herd\
  \ of dolphins appear, swimming along the coast, jumping up and down and playing\
  \ with each other. I follow them till they disappear out of my sight. I think I\
  \ might be dreaming. I just did not expect to find my inner calmness and the most\
  \ beautiful Christmas days of my life alone on a beach, staring out to the sea and\
  \ the infinity."
