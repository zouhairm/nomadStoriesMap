Text: "The loud whirring died away, leaving the dim hallway in silence as the conveyor\
  \ belt shuddered to a stop. It was midnight in the Edinburgh airport baggage claim.\
  \ All of the day\u2019s passengers had retrieved their belongings and left long\
  \ ago. And I was staring at the carousel willing my suitcase to suddenly pop into\
  \ view. It didn\u2019t.\n\nThe next morning, I awoke in a beautiful bed and breakfast\
  \ in Edinburgh, hoping the absence of my suitcase had merely been a dream. Staring\
  \ back at me from atop the luggage rack sat only my carry-on backpack full of camera\
  \ gear, mocking its lack of companion. Sighing, I resigned myself to throwing on\
  \ a spare pair of unwashed jeans, pulled straight from the dirty laundry and stashed\
  \ carelessly into my full-to-bursting backpack at the last second just in case.\
  \ \n\nThough I\u2019m an avid solo traveler now, at age 22 I was still too nervous\
  \ to break from my family in a foreign country. Yet, as we strolled through the\
  \ ancient city, my younger cousins begged to go to Starbucks for breakfast. I did\
  \ not fly 4,000 miles to visit an American chain. On our walk I\u2019d glimpsed\
  \ a cracked and weatherworn shop sign advertising that \"everything is scratch made,\"\
  \ so I took a shaky breath and doubled back, following the scent of fresh soda bread.\
  \ \n\nConfidence bolstered by a round of steaming bread, I decided to continue exploring.\
  \ Now, several years later, I always choose to spend my first day anywhere simply\
  \ wandering wherever the light takes me (I\u2019m a street photographer) and I attribute\
  \ this tradition to that first day in Scotland. \n\nWe'd seen Arthur's Seat in the\
  \ distance, the pinnacle of a group of hills in the middle of the city, deriving\
  \ its name from myriad legends about King Arthur. I set out on a quest to find it.\
  \ I had no directions. Luckily, it is rather easy to find a large hill in the middle\
  \ of a city. \n\nThere is a deep magic in Scotland that, if you\u2019re open to\
  \ it, will give you a taste of the fierce, untamed and powerful stories of the land\
  \ from centuries past. As I crested the hill - doing something I swore that I would\
  \ never in my adult life do and tying my jacket around my waist to keep my one t-shirt\
  \ from getting drenched in sweat - I could already feel an ancestral pull. It was\
  \ that sense of feeling wholly at home, at once familiar with every blade of grass\
  \ and curious where the wind might guide my footsteps.\n\nI went first to the legendary\
  \ seat, joining the throng of travelers aiming to take a selfie where once the great\
  \ king sat. But I was not particularly satisfied with this experience: it felt too\
  \ forced, like I was taking destination advice from an online forum instead of letting\
  \ the route unfold before me. \n\nI walked back down from the tallest peak, following\
  \ a fork in the path that this time led towards a view of the sea. Sometime along\
  \ that few minute trek it began to rain. And I don\u2019t mean drizzle: I was suddenly\
  \ in the downspout as the heavens drained their ethereal bathwater. I was drenched\
  \ within seconds. At first I was worried about my camera, but the stalwart DSLR\
  \ with its nifty 50mm easily fit under my jacket against my side. I kept walking,\
  \ an invisible force drawing me towards an open meadow devoid of people. When I\
  \ arrived, soaking in the view as well as the rain, all I could do was laugh. \n\
  \nI had come to Scotland to get away from my personal life. This trip wasn\u2019\
  t a vacation, it was an escape. I was running away. \n\nYet, as I\u2019d forged\
  \ ahead through the mud, I had unintentionally run towards exactly what I had been\
  \ searching for. The rain petered off into a warm mist, blanketing the hilltop meadow\
  \ in a quiet tranquility. Slowly, the city lights melted away. The honks and raucous\
  \ laughter faded out. Time stopped. I closed my eyes, letting a sense of peace and\
  \ acceptance wash over me. I had lost my belongings. But I\u2019d found where I\
  \ belonged."
