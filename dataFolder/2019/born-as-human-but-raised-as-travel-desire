Text: Travel to makes us to know who we are its helps us to realise what we want in
  our life travel not for happiness travel is to share the happiness with others in
  this world coming out of comfort zones and living the life as a traveler first teaches
  you  how to become a seeker and quick learner and  travel to see people in the other
  side world the who have some madness like you be a  travel where you travel memories
  and travel dairies be the copy of others in there travel pages traveler is always
  a leaner the  more he travel the more he has to learner A traveler bag is always
  simple as he is because he always grab the love from the people around gifted him
  wrap them and pack them carefully in hia bag to show the world that he has met some
  awesome humans other side world being traveler always capture every moment with
  our heart sometimes though we dont have batterys or changing for our cameras we
  make them as picture in our minds and we dont miss anything because we keep our
  heart and soul to captures those memorys  because we want everyone to feel that
  experience many families in india they dont allow there children to travel as parents
  allow in states but thats really dumb traveling makes your chidren to have passionate
  and happy life it teach different cultures myths food friends and many to them above
  all it gives them discipline and care towards others because in travelling we meet
  many other may be there is a chance even to meet your soulmate who know anlot changes
  happen in your childrens life what does every parent wish for? Their happines and
  good life the way above they can find when they start travelling  travel the words
  just the 6 worda when you say from your mouth it will be as word but try to say
  with you heart you will have a smile on your face jusg try to pronounce it with
  your heart not just as a word travelling has taught to the people already who made
  their carrier and gave complete life to travel because they found what they what
  in their life they found what is being rich they found what is being poor they found
  what is being broken they found many thigs today they are being as good soul care
  takers so travlling is a story of everyone because in the travelling you meet many
  people and you learn many things you teach them and many different mindsets ideology
  of being traveler which they eant to make as carrier is 100 percent the right choice
  specially i love to be in woods and meet the peopl of middle class and having food
  with them with some quite music specially we can have that enjoyment with tribe
  peope and their ove dont alow you to go back but still we move on and meet them
  some other day when times allows so travelling is not just passion its a soul traveler
  to meet with some toxic and non toxic people my self i was learning turkish for
  my travel to turkey so that it woud be easy fpr me to commuinicate and uderatand
  their live because later  the language shouldnt be a problem may be we have 4g and
  3g as android and ios but still when you learn the language you can feel when we
  want to prapose someone saying them on call is different but being as a person there
  in front of them and saying those words are different ao when you learn you can
  feel the love they show towards you language is not primary but it helps you to
  understand way faster and keeps you motiivated and activated so i suggest everyone
  to be rolemodel of traveller because the coming generations are way too faster and
  smarter if we havr to be an example for them so first we have to change it bevause
  one life one love and one traveller from journey of traveler you become admirer
  to everyone dont be a tourist be a traveler and soul seeker
