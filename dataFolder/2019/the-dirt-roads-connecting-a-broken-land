Text: "The air was dry with dust and a new layer of dirt settled deeper into our skin.\
  \ We arrived at the first checkpoint, unsure what the guards with the guns were\
  \ going to think. A man drenched in sweat, wearing sunglasses and flip flops walked\
  \ over to our car. Our driver handed the Iraqi guard our passports and exchanged\
  \ the familiar \u2018As-Salaam- Alaikum\u2019 greeting as best he could. He looked\
  \ back into our car to find six American girls eating sunflower seeds and dried\
  \ figs. I looked at him and offered him a handful through the back window. He politely\
  \ put his hand to his chest signing that he was pleased with the offer and placed\
  \ a cigarette back into his mouth. \n\nHe passed us through, knowing that we were\
  \ going to the mountains in Soran to celebrate Nowruz with the other Kurds driving\
  \ north. Bright yellow, red, white and green flags filled the windows of every car.\
  \ People grew tired of driving and we could see their picnic set up on the side\
  \ of the roads. Ten to fifteen men danced shoulder to shoulder celebrating with\
  \ traditional Kurdish music as their wives and daughters prepared the food on colorful\
  \ blankets in the grass. Lines of cars filled the roads and people pulled over to\
  \ sell their watermelons and colorful flags to the passing people. As we drove over\
  \ a small river we noticed the goats jumping from rock to rock and decided to take\
  \ photos of the beautiful scenery. A symbol of Kurdistan painted on a rock for all\
  \ to see when they drove through. The flag which symbolized their people and their\
  \ history decorated the large rock. The clouds filled the clear blue sky and as\
  \ each person drove by they honked and cheered with agreement. \n\nWe continued\
  \ to follow the lead car throughout the shadowing mountains and onto the winding\
  \ dirt paths and into the valley where we would spend the rest of the day. I watched\
  \ as the little girl in the bed of the truck bounced up and down with each bump.\
  \ Her traditional jili kurdi was dazzled with sequins and colorful beads. I wondered\
  \ how she was going to run around when I was tripping over my own long skirt that\
  \ was supposed to tie in the back. The makeup on our faces was sticky and the sweat\
  \ dripped down our backs. The men wore their brown and blue traditional fabrics\
  \ and rankus.\n\nFinally, after many hours, we arrived at a vacant valley and retrieved\
  \ all of the coolers of prepared food and blankets that lined the grass. When we\
  \ finally sat down to eat, I looked over at the 20-foot makeshift table that we\
  \ had made on the ground. Each of us sat, knee to knee, in awe of all that was prepared\
  \ for this special day. Platters of colorful vegetables, chicken, rice and bread\
  \ covered the plastic tablecloth and we began to eat with our hands. The spices\
  \ lined our lips and we laughed with one another as we each tried the little green\
  \ and red peppers. \n\nAfter we ate, we quickly joined together and cleaned so that\
  \ we could thank our Kurdish hosts and begin dancing to the music on the car radio.\
  \ Other families of thirty to forty people started to arrive in the valley and they\
  \ too danced with smiles on their faces. We were filled with such gratitude and\
  \ awe of their kindness. As we looked around at the mountains and hills that which\
  \ surrounded us, we could see the true beauty of the Kurdistan region. A region\
  \ of loss and grief was celebrating late into the night with such joy and abundance\
  \ and we were privileged to celebrate with them."
