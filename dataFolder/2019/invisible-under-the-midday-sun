Text: "If you've ever walked down Market Street with your eyes wide open, you may\
  \ have noticed that the real valley is not the one accompanied by the tech-inclined\
  \ Silicon. Instead, it's the U-shaped form where global headquarters peak at opposite\
  \ sides of the street, and those who got lost in their daydreams meet the bottom.\n\
  \nLiving in San Francisco can quickly become about startups and miraculous ways\
  \ to multiply profits. While my classmates were too busy looking up to this extreme\
  \ of the valley, however, I took a chance with the other. \"Do you wanna grab lunch?\"\
  \ I said to the homeless man in his mid-20s, holding an \"I'm hungry, please help\"\
  \ sign at the heart of Civic Center, a pigeon-populated corner of the UN Plaza.\
  \ \"Me?\" replied a voice behind the carelessly grown-out beard, the googly eyes\
  \ blinking in unbelief, and the shaking rags-tied hands that quickly pushed down\
  \ the floor lifting the malnourished body. \n\nClumsily shaking off the dust of\
  \ his clothes and tucking in his sign under the comforter he keeps at the plaza,\
  \ he smiled with anticipated gratitude. I had the feeling I was the first person\
  \ in quite some time to see his claim and give him a proper reply. He carried the\
  \ humility of someone who got used to being invisible in California's midday sun.\n\
  \nIt was 1 pm on a Sunday in mid-January, and we walked to a nearby Subway for a\
  \ marinara meatball sub. As a college student on a budget, that was my typical meal\
  \ during the weekend. I judged it would be the healthiest, most filling one I could\
  \ provide him - a semi-truth I would also tell myself. We headed to the closest\
  \ restaurant in the chain, which was two and a half blocks away.\n\nIn the first\
  \ half, I asked him how he was feeling. He replied that things were not easy, but\
  \ that it was a special day, as it was sunny again in the windy SF, and that God,\
  \ or the universe, was blessing him through my generosity.\n\nIt occurred to me\
  \ that I was being blessed through his words.\n\nHeading South of Market Street\
  \ on 7th, I asked him his name. \"Alejandro,\" replied in an enthusiastic Latin\
  \ American accent. Then he went on adding that he was from Colombia and asking me\
  \ where I come from. When I said \"Brazil,\" he started speaking perfect Portuguese\
  \ to me and asked me if I knew Vinicius de Morais, one of his favorite musicians.\n\
  \nOf course I did! And between Stevenson and Mission, we sang \"\xC1guas de Mar\xE7\
  o\" together. Out loud. For the first time in months, I felt connected to home by\
  \ connecting with a homeless person.\n\nIn this spirit, we arrived at the Subway\
  \ and ordered our meals. He couldn't believe I let him have two sandwiches, and\
  \ I insisted it was okay. When we sat down to eat, I asked Alejandro the big question:\
  \ \"How did you end up here?\"\n\nHe told me that back in Colombia, his family invested\
  \ all they had in his education. Beyond Spanish and Portuguese, he grew up speaking\
  \ four other languages. Most of the time, however, he would dedicate his mind and\
  \ body to learning what he loved most in the world: playing the violin. He was a\
  \ member of a famous orchestra in Bogot\xE1 and went to SF to audition for a position,\
  \ recognition, a better life. \"You can check my videos on YouTube,\" he said, \"\
  I made my family proud.\" \n\nThe story goes that Alejandro couldn't afford a place\
  \ to sleep and spent the night at a cold Muni station, where his violin was stolen.\
  \ He missed his audition on the following day and got stuck in SF without enough\
  \ money to go home.\n\nI don't know if everything Alejandro told me was true, but\
  \ I do know that when I got home, I opened YouTube and found myself astonished by\
  \ his beautiful performances. He was the brightest person I met in the city, and\
  \ I wished others could appreciate him; could see the talent behind his socially-built\
  \ invisibility.\n\nI never saw Alejandro on the streets again."
