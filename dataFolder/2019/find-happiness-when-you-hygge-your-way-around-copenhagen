Text: "When you hear Denmark, what immediately comes to mind? For me, it\u2019s the\
  \ word hygge (pronounced hoo-gah). This concept loosely translates to \u2018creating\
  \ coziness\u2019 in your life has caught the wellness realm\u2019s attention in\
  \ 2016 when Denmark was named the world\u2019s happiest country for the third time.\
  \ The Danes attribute one of their happiness factors to the hygge lifestyle they\
  \ embody in their daily lives.\n\nWith a love to cozy up in the winter, I headed\
  \ to Copenhagen to see first-hand what hygge is all about and to get an \xFCber-hyggelig\_\
  experience.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned, hygge isn\u2019t just creating an aesthetic\
  \ environment that feels cozy, it is a feeling that exudes contentment. \n\nUpon\
  \ arriving in Copenhagen, you could sense calmness in the air. People were relaxed\
  \ and smiling.  On the metro, before a girl sat down across from me, she flashed\
  \ a smile and continued to smile all the way to her stop. \n\nAt the Torvehallerne\_\
  market, just down the street from Norreport Metro station is a culinary hot spot.\
  \ Here you\u2019ll find a vast selection of foods and goods to try under one roof\
  \ that will no doubt satiate your appetite and taste buds with good local company.\
  \ This is where I got down to my hygge investigation.\n\nAs I was enjoying my tapas,\
  \ I ordered a glass of red from Denmark. The man behind the counter looked at me\
  \ funny and said, \u201Cit would be irresponsible for me to pour you a glass of\
  \ red from Denmark.\u201D The lady who was next to me agreed, \u201Ctrust me he\
  \ is right. It is not very good. Our weather is not conditioned to make fine wine.\
  \ I\u2019d stick to the wines from France.\u201D From there, we stroked up a conversation\
  \ and I told her I was on the hunt for the best places to hygge while in Copenhagen.\n\
  \n\u201CWell, the best would be a homemade experience at a Dane\u2019s house. You\
  \ get to enjoy a tasty home-cooked Danish meal, indulge in sweet treats over great\
  \ conversation with all the cozy elements. Why don\u2019t you and your friend come\
  \ over Tuesday night for dinner,\u201D she asked with a smile. Sadly, we couldn\u2019\
  t take up her offer. \n\nShe then introduced us to the people she was with. It turned\
  \ out they had just met as well. As she introduced us, she leaned in and said, \u201C\
  the concept of hygge is not just about coziness, it\u2019s about being in the moment\
  \ with the people you are with and enjoying the social interaction you are having.\u201D\
  \  \n\nAnother Dane we met later on in the night said something similar. He said,\
  \ \u201Cwhat we are doing now - having an open-hearted, engaged conversation sharing\
  \ about our cultures, enjoying each other\u2019s company over a craft beer is hyggelig.\
  \ It\u2019s appreciating these simple moments and things in life. Doing things that\
  \ make you feel good. This is the essence of hygge.\u201D\n\nAs we continued to\
  \ explore Copenhagen, interact with the locals, and watching them socialize with\
  \ one another over hot drinks and comfort food, it became apparent the art of hygge\
  \ is not rocket science. Surprisingly, it\u2019s simple. Simpler than I expected.\n\
  \nIt is about slowing down. Enjoying the company you are with, in an environment\
  \ that oozes relaxation \u2013 be it at home, or a cozy caf\xE9 with soft lighting\
  \ in K\xF8dbyens neighborhood, or out in nature relaxing in a wooden barrel hot\
  \ tub at Copenhut with your friends. The idea is to be socially present, connecting\
  \ with those around you and not constantly be on your phone. It is using your time\
  \ to indulge, doing the things you enjoy that are fun, and being with people that\
  \ fuel you not drain you. \n\nPerhaps, this is why people say there is beauty in\
  \ simplicity. And the practice of hygge is certainly that, especially when it makes\
  \ you feel warm and fuzzy inside. This feeling transcends to your interactions with\
  \ others. \n\nAs my carry-on was sorted to the side for further inspection at the\
  \ Kastrup airport, in which I hastily said \u2018sorry.\u2019 The officer looked\
  \ at me with a smile and said, \u201CMiss don\u2019t be sorry. There\u2019s no need.\
  \ Be happy. Carry on.\u2019"
