Text: "I love to travel. I love travelling more than anything in the world. When I\
  \ was little my parents used to take me on road trips around the country. Then,\
  \ as I grow up I started going on trips with my school. Now, I travel alone or with\
  \ my friends. \n\nLast February me and some friends went on a city break in Barcelona.\
  \ Spain is by far one of my favorite countries, so Barcelona was an obvious choice\
  \ for a trip. Of course, I made a list of everything I wanted to see: Paltja Barceloneta,\
  \ The Gothic Quarter, La Rambla, The Gaudi Houses, Sagrada Familia. Basically I\
  \ wanted to take in all that I could from the culture and the vibrance of the city.\n\
  \nOn one of the days we decided to go to Park Guell. We had to change several buses\
  \ as it was quite far from where we was staying, but I was oh so excited.  As soon\
  \ as we got there I was fascinated with the architecture. A part of the park was\
  \ free to visit, the other part, the one with the most important landmarks wasn't.\
  \ We visited the the second part first. It was beautiful. The colors, the shapes,\
  \ the view. Everything. Afterwards we went on and decided to spend some time chilling\
  \ in the park. The weather was perfect! Not too, not too cold.  We hiked all the\
  \ way to the top. The view was incredible! No other place took my breath away the\
  \ way this place did. And it all fitted so perfectly with the music of the buskers\
  \ playing all around me. The Spanish guitars, all those strings... it was magical.\
  \ I closed my eyes and for a moment I felt like I disappeared. No worries, no fears,\
  \ no doubts. I was surrounded by peace and freedom. \n\nI didn't feel anything like\
  \ it since that moment, but I hope I can find it again."
