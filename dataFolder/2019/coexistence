Text: "The Route from Nagpur to Jaipur via train was of 20hrs long. I was traveling\
  \ alone in a sleeper class because that is the most fun and real, ones Indian train\
  \ journey can be (experienced). The journey started with splashes of water as the\
  \ monsoon has arrived. Sun is hidden behind the clouds turning the afternoon into\
  \ evening. The breeze with water splashing on the window, dim lights, and a group\
  \ of handsome young boys singing slow melodious romantic songs. Who cares for first\
  \ class seats. From Nagpur to Jaipur the train had to cross three states, Maharashtra,\
  \ Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.\n\nI have always been an avid traveler and my first\
  \ preference is train coz it's the most economical transport one can have in India.\
  \ This route though was my first because Rajasthan was my first. If one wants to\
  \ experience real India a train journey alone can fill your basket with 50% of experience.\
  \ One can gain so much in a train journey, especially in the second class. The people,\
  \ the way they function, the landscapes, the station haults, the way people turn\
  \ train journey into family picnics, one can explore all.\nThis route was a bit\
  \ different, the train was going through Chambal. Chambal valley is famous for caves,\
  \ deep forests, tunnels and decoits. I was really worried about the decoits situation\
  \ but boy the valley surprised me even more. As the train tracks are constructed\
  \ by cutting through the hills, the hills have harboured streams in the monsoon\
  \ which striked the train making us wet sometimes. The lush green deep forests with\
  \ streams and the train passing right through made my journey and yes the background\
  \ live music. In this peace I reached Jaipur.\nJaipur is a heritage city aka the\
  \ pink city of India.\nAs a kid I always have seen pictures of Hawa Mahal in my\
  \ textbooks so I decided to start my journey from it. I took a rickshaw for Hawa\
  \ Mahal. \nLiving in this kind of cities which are globally recognised and are on\
  \ the go for tourists people here somehow develop the sense that the another person\
  \ is might not from here. The rickshaw driver sensed it and started to tell me about\
  \ Jaipur, It's history that how the king Jai Singh who was so visionary at that\
  \ time 1700s planned this gated city as his new capital next to Amer (old capital)\
  \ which was situated on a hill. The city was planned according to the nine planets\
  \ ( grah) and how the palaces of important people were kept on centre etc. And now\
  \ referred as old city, while the new extensions to it can be referred as new city\
  \ \nThe ride was wonderful, and I came to Hawa Mahal.\nHawa Mahal which I have only\
  \ seen in textbooks was standing right in front of me. The vast glorious carved\
  \ sandstone building of Rajputana architecture was so breathtaking that I wanted\
  \ to just jump to it. And For that I had to cross the road because I was standing\
  \ on itsopposite side. \nHere I was so not able to cross the road and all my praise\
  \ & excitement got diluted. Hawa Mahal is the most important building which attracts\
  \ tourists but the area surrounding it was so chaotic, with very unorganised vehicular\
  \ movements. I was shocked and stumped down by the insensitivity of the authorities\
  \ & the people here who can't organise this, but later passed this feeling as the\
  \ building was calling me.\nFor two days I just walked in the old city. The authenticity\
  \ it had, it's roots everything was intact. I was in love with the people, the way\
  \ they led their lives, the gated city and the chaos everything was so old school\
  \ yet refreshing. To my amusement one can still find road dentist here the practice\
  \ which was done by self certified doctors in 70s 80s. A metro station is constructing\
  \ there which will connect it with the new Jaipur.\nThe city didn't changed it's\
  \ way it just coexisted with the new development and this is where I felt in love\
  \ with Jaipur."
