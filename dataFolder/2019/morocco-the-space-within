Text: "Morocco is a country of contrasts, poverty, austerity, but also a place of\
  \ humanity and the joy of living\nA place, most of the time, is more than just a\
  \ geographical space that we have access, with our senses. It's an unstoppable place\
  \ for memories, retrievals, inner freaks, and recollection.This travel rock my world,\
  \ crocheted on the edges of dunes of forgotten times, for that's the jump to the\
  \ unknown. \nI woke up in a tumult that seemed to be on the edge of the ocean. Whenever\
  \ you look at Morocco you feel you see it for the first time. Still from the airport,\
  \ you felt like you were penetrating another space, a space where my comfort zone\
  \ was lost when the new space was launched. What comfort zone when I felt floating\
  \ over the well-defined world barriers in the world's corner. What would have been\
  \ the probability of losing a baggage in that place? The airport and its staff are\
  \ always surprised by this. Reaching them from your eyes when I look at you and\
  \ telling you that it will take you until you officially rejoin your luggage may\
  \ seem cruel to you, it is an expression of their natural tranquility, a tranquility\
  \ the Westerners are looking for with much money by books and Oriental courses of\
  \ all kinds.\nThe train seemed to return you in another dimension of time. Once\
  \ on the train to the city, I saw the city become a space of contrasts that dazzles\
  \ you with its original melancholy.\nMorocco: a remembrance of the past\n\nBetween\
  \ the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the Atlas Mountains and the Sahara,\
  \ Morocco offers a symphony of bright and contrasting landscapes, the Marrakech\
  \ and Fez Medes of the Thousand Years, the famous mosque in the House, the western\
  \ air of Tanger and the blue palette of Chefchaouen, where the ocean meets the continent,\
  \ and the desert meets the mountain, a great adventure in isolated civilizations\
  \ in a natural setting that will remain impregnated for a long time on the retina.\
  \ For how would we be, people without memories?\n\nBehind occidental spaces with\
  \ colorful buildings, historically well-placed, floral patterns, luxuriant French\
  \ gardens, you can find the sound of a simple life, with no luxury on the part of\
  \ people. On the way to the Sahara I found Merzouga, a village where people live\
  \ out of what they are producing and who buy their food and water by miles a day,\
  \ but who are waiting for you with a cup of tea in their small houses where their\
  \ wrinkled faces never forget to smile at you. Here a smile does not cost, and tea\
  \ is free, always accompanied with a long and daring smile. Poverty is poverty,\
  \ and wealth is something you do not see in Europe. There is such a miracle and\
  \ pain at the same time that the mixture dazzles and numbs you, as a form of self-defense,\
  \ the perception that is usually alive and sensitive to strong contrasts.\nMorocco\
  \ is a city of contrasts, a city of boutiques, melange between the Orient and the\
  \ West, a loop of the past, where you feel like a true Babylon with snakes, ambulance\
  \ vendors where the bargain is a thing of the day, surrounded with medina with various\
  \ goods, with ancient and mysterious cities dusted with time, Morocco is a piece\
  \ of heaven, which devours and rages you whenever you see it. It is a space of joy,\
  \ joy of giving and receiving.\nI remember that a few years ago I read Maitreyi,\
  \ and I remembered the grief and wonders of Eliade as a European in Asia. I was\
  \ a European in Africa and I felt the amazing struggle. Morocco is a country of\
  \ contrasts, poverty, austerity, primitivism, but also a place of humanity and the\
  \ joy of living, the inner tumult and the people of unlimited generosity.\nSometime\
  \ I would return to this Babylon, a space of seeking and recovery."
