Text: "Watching uncle Stanley sharpen what I call a machete, or a pig knife in his\
  \ world, I enjoyed the rhythmic sound of soft steel rubbing hard steel. He was preparing\
  \ for a unique event in the tribal life of a tiny village on Tanna, a mid-sized\
  \ island in south Pacific country of Vanuatu. As the small, young boys gathered\
  \ barefoot around the start of a dirt path to the beach with permanent smiles and\
  \ curious eyes watching their \u201Cuncle\u201D work, none of them had any idea\
  \ what was to come. Soon one of them would be chosen to participate in a ritual\
  \ that every man of Port Resolution village has endured. Without their mother\u2019\
  s knowledge or consent, they would transform from a child to a village boy, receiving\
  \ the gift of circumcision, skillfully executed by an uncle with a pig knife. \n\
  You would think that this would be the highlight of the day, but it wasn\u2019t.\
  \ There was another ritual occurring at the same time that was much more important\
  \ where a village boy would become a village man. This is a big deal in the island\
  \ outer villages, occurring maybe once a year. The month before, the village men\
  \ would have met nightly, while drinking kava and discussing the major happenings\
  \ of village life. A proud father would bring up his desire to elevate his son to\
  \ the status of a man. This would require a unanimous agreement with all the other\
  \ men to accept him as an equal and mentor him with their experience, wisdom, and\
  \ love. A feast would be planned that the entire tribe would pitch in for: a pig\
  \ here, a few chickens there, bags of rice, and large cassava everywhere. The parents\
  \ would offer up a cow, or two if they could afford it, to insure that everyone\
  \ would remember the event. The women of the village spent three days preparing\
  \ many rice and veggies dishes, lovingly wrapped in green palm leaves, cooking all\
  \ of it the day before in a giant earthen oven.\nThe young person was lead to a\
  \ private beach in the morning away from the eyes of the girls and women. His uncles,\
  \ and the previous initiated man who had the same ceremony last year, began the\
  \ day by teasing the boy about what was to come. Filled with fear remembering his\
  \ circumcision ritual, they walked the same dirt path.  His face of fear turned\
  \ joyous as the men gave him a shave and a haircut. They scrubbed his body with\
  \ freshly made coconut milk and mixed it with sand, exfoliating his skin. An older\
  \ uncle got to whip him a few times with a switch made from a rainforest tree, reminding\
  \ him to respect his elders. He cleansed himself in the sea and drip dried while\
  \ his extended family sang songs, laughed at and with him. His new clothes that\
  \ matched the other men of his family. \nMeanwhile, the uncles were trying to select\
  \ which boy was to be the \u201Clucky\u201D one when I was jokingly asked if my\
  \ son Luke wanted to be circumcised. When I affirmed that it had already been done,\
  \ he was asked to participate in the ceremony sparing the four days of pain for\
  \ a young boy .  We walked back to the village, where the celebration started. Everyone\
  \ presented gifts ranging from cooking pots, bowls, clothes, the odd chicken, and\
  \ very large kava roots to the young man. The guests from the other villages showed\
  \ up with sacks of rice, kava roots, and smiles.  Since I arrived by sailboat, I\
  \ was asked to contribute some petrol for the village generator. Twenty liters kept\
  \ the music playing until the wee hours of the next morning.\nOnce the ceremony\
  \ was complete the new man could begin the process of learning a trade, building\
  \ his own house, and preparing for his uncles to choose him a wife. The transformational\
  \ process from child to boy to man was a deeply symbolic ritual that created strong\
  \ community bonds and I was lucky to witness it first hand. My son Luke is looking\
  \ forward to returning to Tanna to claim his place as a man among the tribe."
