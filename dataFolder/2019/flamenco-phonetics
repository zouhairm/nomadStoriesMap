Text: "It was summer and the air was dry. Dry enough to hear one's thoughts crisping\
  \ their way through a wondering daydream.\nForty five degrees and up, I was trotting\
  \ down the way on the old paves, yellow sabots clacking behind me to echo another\
  \ home , reminding me we are not in Conscious anymore. Not so long ago I had a red\
  \ suitcase for a shadow sound.\nJuan is already waiting in his narrow pink studio,\
  \ incense smells take over the patio, under-mining my idea of time and place. Inside,\
  \ heavy blend of sacred odours will drag me centered, and when the cuckoo clock\
  \ points midday his wooden cane will pound the wooden floor, a happy middle, kiss\
  \ meets knock, accompanied by our \"golpes\" of heels and toes.  \nCovering the\
  \ walls you see: 1 Jesus, Seville\u2019s football team, 2 Marias, many famous faces\
  \ in black and white , 1 old calendar and 1 new, not to be confused, and many pictures\
  \ of his family members, dancing, singing, aging well.\nSweat and sour steam the\
  \ mirror in front of us, we can hardly see and so become much attentive to Juan\u2019\
  s counts. He does not always count. He tara ta tum, tiri ta ta and to the occasion\
  \ six or eight or ten we will accentuate our entire self into one south end of a\
  \ body.\nWhen he rolls his double R with tiny waves of air, I clearly see old knots\
  \ of culture mirrored in their own fragments, and hence they R.\nThe double R, rolling\
  \ on the tongue, like a running ball between two goals, or the sportscaster\u2019\
  s voice in that same game, the game I watched at nightfall in the local bar with\
  \ many old men without many young teeth, or any. \nThis endless alveolar trill,\
  \ tiny taps of tongue in hollow palate, resonance of horses\u2019 trots in quite\
  \ allies. That itself should roll another souvenir in mind, of a very dressed lady\
  \ in the beautiful naked plaza, tickling away her castanets. My eyes tried to follow\
  \ my ears, betting between them as for whether it was a woman or a horseshoe dancing\
  \ here.\nThe eye won a wonderful swirl of red and black from which one earing flew\
  \ away to where there was no more body just a movement trail.\nThe over rolling\
  \ R may reflect in many pairs of clapping hands, as at Gonzalo\u2019s last night.\
  \ Happy full laughers over an empty beer, so generous they are, encouraging, who\
  \ will sing, who will dance, Ramon, Raul, or maybe one without an R, a Jesus to\
  \ keep the harmony in this old place falling apart, standing, still, thanks to its\
  \ Roots. \nR and R will be a summer eve on river side, red wine strings of old guitar,\
  \ or, the roaring public behind a raged toreador. \nAll of the above yet nothing\
  \ to declare, one and two still dancing underneath Juan\u2019s few days beard-hair.\n\
  And with time they will sum up to the perfect twelve beats I hear in class, later\
  \ to be cuddled with the melody and very sad, even when happy, lyrics. \nJuan lifts\
  \ his wooden cane to fix a naughty frame that got tired, we are tired too, yet cuckoo\
  \ didn\u2019t say it\u2019s time to stop.\nBut Juan, he stops to think, you can\
  \ see it on his mouth, his eyes squint smaller and an old-ink marked palm is raised.\
  \ \nHe is on stage. \nHe is far away, and so am I.\nI can hear the quite anticipation\
  \ of the public, I can smell the smoke machine behind the scenes, I hear the beating\
  \ heart, I hear.\nMy bare feet are anxious, my hands comfort selves in their own\
  \ arms. It is dark, the lights keep me warm.\n\u201CYou should go onstage as a woman\u201D\
  \ he says, \u201Cand go off the stage as a lioness\u201D.\n\nI walk into my cave\
  \ where it is and not all are, quiet safe white noise in mind.  I think of what\
  \ he said and tiredly let my hair down. \n\nHome."
