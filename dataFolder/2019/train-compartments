Text: "I\u2019m sitting with three men and there are four men sitting in front of\
  \ me. One is on my right, and two to my left. Two men sitting across each other\
  \ in the side berth. Travelling by the general coach in a train meant travelling\
  \ without space to sleep. I knew that and learnt it also meant travelling among\
  \ a lot of men. I looked around for a decent spot but all the window seats were\
  \ taken. I was surprised that I couldn\u2019t get a window seat even though I was\
  \ at the station almost 2 hours early. The guy in front of me walked up to me, just\
  \ a few minutes after I sat down. The berth I\u2019d picked had both the window\
  \ seats and side seats occupied but the rest was empty.\nA bearded man at the window\
  \ seat in front of me in a Telugu film, would be the guy with a dark past but has\
  \ mellowed down and is currently migrating for better prospects because of his love\
  \ interest (he kept calling a woman and gave her updates). He had a baby face hidden\
  \ under the beard, nothing great, just unkempt hair haphazardly growing across his\
  \ face. He\u2019s interesting because he looks like a goons who\u2019s got a bounty\
  \ on him. The guy next to me has a puffy face and a French beard. He\u2019s also\
  \ heading to Bangalore and has a friend/ relative in a different berth, looks like\
  \ they are all occupying a window seat and belong to a cult that only sits by the\
  \ window. But this man had left his bag to hold his spot and he was out on the platform\
  \ creepily staring into the window when I waked in to the berth.\nA boy comes up\
  \ to me and asks me if anyone else was coming and I said no. He said he\u2019ll\
  \ come back but then this older lady walked in as he moved away, she looked Tamil\
  \ with her bindi, smile, saree and then the accent. The turmeric stained face with\
  \ vibhoodi (holy ash) was the marker of her Tamilness. A Tamilian from Bangalore,\
  \ Kammanhalli, she said. I told her someone else was coming and then these guys\
  \ came back, the lady took the next berth and they bonded (like it happens in Trains,\
  \ short and without a future. Temporary things). So they are 5 boys from Austin\
  \ Town, Ulsoor. They spoke in Tamil and I felt like they embodied the stereotyped\
  \ boys group and they even had a bubloo amongst them.\nBubloo is sitting to my left\
  \ and in front of me is the guy who asked me about the seats. He lives and works\
  \ in Hyderabad now but his family, used to live in Austin town but they moved a\
  \ year ago. He\u2019s the decent guy and next to him is that talkative, fun, irritating,\
  \ and really annoying guy who\u2019d usually be the hero if it were a film. And\
  \ then the other two boys who are like the extras just to make the group look big\
  \ and symmetrical in photos.\nThen on the side berth is this man who was holding\
  \ a canvas and was. He was using colour pencils to sketch and when it got darker\
  \ he packed his shit and put on a green hoodie, wrapped a bed sheet around him and\
  \ slept. Then when the TC came he woke everyone up checked their tickets and left.\
  \ The artist looked so lost and disoriented he reminded me of a puppy looking for\
  \ its mum but he managed to go back to sleep. Then a security with a video cam woke\
  \ everyone up and recorded all the faces and left. He scared some people with his\
  \ rude demeanour and left the general compartment.\nSo these are berths for four\
  \ people and then everyone has been asking us to move and adjust and sit six in\
  \ a berth. So we\u2019ve been ignoring them and their rudeness or requests because\
  \ we said we\u2019re all travelling to Bangalore but they retort with too bad for\
  \ you, kind of reactions. The train starts and I\u2019m excited about getting to\
  \ Bangalore and through the night."
