Text: "Adam\u2019s Peak: The High Spot of Any Trip to Sri Lanka.\n\nOver decades of\
  \ travelling one experience, 30 years ago, is still indelibly imprinted on my memory\
  \ - Climbing Adam\u2019s Peak, in the middle of Sri Lanka. \n\nIn the thirteenth\
  \ century Marco Polo is reported to have said that Adam\u2019s Peak was: \u2018\
  A very high mountain so rocky and precipitous that the ascent to the top is impractical\
  \ except by assistance.\u201D\n\nToday, Adam\u2019s Peak (7420 ft) is sacred to\
  \ three religions at least. At the time there were basically three routes to the\
  \ top: from Ratnapura, from Kuruwita and from Hatton; now there are more, but those\
  \ are still the main ones.\n\nTwo of us, who had meet by coincidence the day before\
  \ in Colombo, began our expedition with a four hour drive ending at nearly midnight\
  \ when we were lost somewhere in the middle of Sri Lanka on a dirt track road winding\
  \ round the hills, full of dark shadows, but with no sign of life. Suddenly, we\
  \ see lights that twinkle up the mountain ultimately merging with the stars. Where\
  \ did the earthly lamps end and the Milky Way began. Where was the line between\
  \ being \u2018of this world\u2019 and being \u2018out of this world\u2019? \n\n\
  It took us another hour to find our way to the starting point of the climb. At about\
  \ 1 am, on a clear cloudless night we began the challenge to walk/climb for about\
  \ three and a half hours. The route was full of thousands of local pilgrims from\
  \ young girls with babies, to grandmothers; some took hours, others days. One or\
  \ two never returned! Others have made the climb more than a dozen times. All were\
  \ friendly, but there was little time, or energy, for conversation. Outwardly we\
  \ were healthy males, but we were soon puffing and muttering agonies, at the same\
  \ time as wondering how everyone else seemed to be taking it all in their stride.\
  \ \n\nOnward and upward. Step by step, thousand and thousands. Shallow ones at first,\
  \ gradually getting steeper, until the final hundred or so, which were virtually\
  \ straight up. It was pure inspiration that gave us the energy to run that final\
  \ stage. How many steps? Apparently that is a question to which there no two people\
  \ agree on. Anyway what a crazy way to pass a journey of a lifetime counting the\
  \ steps! The construction of the pathway is a wonder in itself.\n \nBy the side\
  \ of the path, there are dozens of tea stops and resting places. Tea never felt\
  \ so refreshing, and it was not surprising to find the prices rose as you got nearer\
  \ the top. \n\nWhen you reach the top it is the custom to ring the bell. And listen\
  \ to the echo vibrate around the hills and deep into the soul. \n\nAt 4.30am it\
  \ is still dark and cold. A sizeable viewing platform and shrine enabled hundreds\
  \ of pilgrims, together with travellers from foreign parts, huddle together under\
  \ blankets, to wait for the magic of the dawn.\n\nThe dawn view is incredible. Few\
  \ mountain tops can create a comparable impression of isolation and unity. A feeling\
  \ of being out of this world, in outer space, among the Gods \u2013 which, in so\
  \ many ways it is. \n\nOver the misty cloud the sun casts a vast dark triangular\
  \ shadow of the summit, almost a perfect pyramid, onto the hills behind. At first\
  \ the peak lies many miles away then, as the sun slowly rises, and the shadow races\
  \ backwards until it is swallowed into the rock of the peak itself.\n\nIt was an\
  \ agony to leave. But the essential experience was over at least for another day,\
  \ although the essential experience would never be over. \n\nThe walk down seemed\
  \ so much shorter. I was thankful for the assistance that made the climb manageable\
  \ for today\u2019s 20th Century visitor. But I could not help viewing with mixed\
  \ feelings that progress in the 21st Century could mean cable cars and helicopter\
  \ landing pads. That was certainly not what Marco Polo had in mind when he mentioned\
  \ the need for \u201Cassistance\u201D. But, perhaps, he would have thought the even\
  \ concrete steps went too far? \n\n\nBruce Lloyd."
