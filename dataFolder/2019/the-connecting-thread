Text: "In the summer of 2018, while I was posted in the clamorous city of Gorakhpur,\
  \ I decided to take a day off and visit Nepal. Accessible through the road crossing\
  \ at Sonauli, the country is barely an hour\u2019s drive from the city. My destination\
  \ was Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha. I\u2019d heard many tales about how\
  \ wonderfully the sacred place had been preserved by the Nepalese government. More\
  \ so, a lot of Buddhist countries, weather rich or poor, had constructed monasteries\
  \ around the holy shrine in a bid to claim the religious space. Enticed by the promise\
  \ of serenity, I booked a cab without a second thought. \nThe driver arrived fifteen\
  \ minutes before the designated hour. He was a tall and plump fellow, who appeared\
  \ to be a little too talkative for his own good. As we began our journey, he started\
  \ telling me stories about how he\u2019d driven to Nepal on multiple occasions and\
  \ how thoroughly he knew the length and breadth of this country. Though his narrative\
  \ kept me hooked for a little while, I soon lost interest and began to enjoy the\
  \ beauty around me instead. He continued to talk incessantly but with an open window\
  \ on one hand and a view of the Himalayan foothills on another, his voice relegated\
  \ itself to being background noise. Before long, we crossed over to Nepal. \nLumbini\
  \ was even more incredible than I\u2019d thought it would be. The massive compound\
  \ of the shrine was divided into eastern and western wings, separated by an artificial\
  \ pond. From my limited understanding of the religion, I\u2019d gathered that the\
  \ beliefs and consequently the symbols of all three of its branches- Mahayana, Theravada\
  \ and Vajrayana- varied. However, there was a set of multi-coloured flags which\
  \ graced almost all the monasteries, irrespective of the sect that they belonged\
  \ to. This left me confused. The driver, sensing my ignorance, spoke up.\n\u201C\
  These flags are like a connecting string, Sir\u201D, he said, \u201CThey unite all\
  \ forms of Buddhism into one. It is said that the colours of these flags reflect\
  \ the colours of Buddha\u2019s aura. They stand for peace, compassion, strength\
  \ and wisdom\u201D.                                                            \
  \                       \u201CAre you a Buddhist?\u201D I asked impulsively.   \
  \                                                                              \
  \    \u201CAren\u2019t we all, Sir?\u201D he replied with a smile.             \
  \                                                                              \u201C\
  Buddha stands for enlightenment\u201D, he continued, \u201CAnd that enlightenment\
  \ can come only through happiness. In one way or the other, aren\u2019t we all striving\
  \ for happiness? Some find it in their jobs, others in their families. Ultimately,\
  \ we are all treading the path which leads to the Buddha\u201D.                \
  \                                                                              \
  \                                                 For a moment, I was rendered speechless.\
  \ His understanding of a religion that he did not even follow was immense. In a\
  \ world plagued superficiality, how many people had the courage to arm themselves\
  \ with knowledge?     \nMost of the remaining part of my trip was loaded with conversations.\
  \ As it turns out, the driver had developed a keen interest in religion since he\u2019\
  d been a child. Over the years, he had picked up a couple of sacred books belonging\
  \ to different faiths. He\u2019d read the Gita, the Quran, translations of the Tripitaka\
  \ and bits and parts of the Avesta. He had picked up all of these books from the\
  \ stalls at railway stations which carried crude copies of the actual texts. He\
  \ hadn\u2019t yet been able to lay his hands on the Bible but he wanted to read\
  \ it soon. Call it curiosity or admiration but suddenly, he didn\u2019t seem to\
  \ be so talkative anymore. \nAs he dropped me off at my place, I asked him where\
  \ I could reach him. Quickly, he pulled out a paper and scribbled something over\
  \ it. Abbas Hashmi, it read, followed by his address and phone number. The very\
  \ next day, I purchased a copy of the Bible and sent it to him. He gave me a ring\
  \ that evening and thanked me profusely for the gift. But the truth was that it\
  \ was he, who had given me the gift of knowledge. \nIt\u2019d taken me a trip to\
  \ Nepal for actually understanding the strength and power of the beautiful thread\
  \ that binds this country. Maybe this was what the oft-repeated \u2018secularism\u2019\
  \ was truly about - A Muslim driver, ferrying a Hindu passenger to a Buddhist shrine.\
  \ \nMaybe this was the true essence of India."
