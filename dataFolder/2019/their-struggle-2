Text: "Whilst in Malaysia I had the incredible privilege to meet a truly inspiring\
  \ trans-gender woman, this is a piece I wrote on her struggle with her identity\
  \ and her religion. \n\nA woman stood outside of a Mosque, she stood at the entrance,\
  \ staring it down as the building towered above her, daring her to do something.\
  \ Her struggle was one she wasn\u2019t sure she could win. She wasn\u2019t always\
  \ a woman, but she had been a woman for almost a decade now. She was used to being\
  \ shunned, but it didn\u2019t make it any easier, she just became numb to it. \n\
  She wanted to go in, but the people inside did not want her there, for last time\
  \ she tried to enter she was told not to come back until she dressed as a man. Something\
  \ she had not done for a decade, she wasn\u2019t about to start now. \nShe starred\
  \ down the entrance, but after a while she turned around and left. Today wasn\u2019\
  t the day she decided, maybe tomorrow. She struggled internally, feeling guilty\
  \ for being unable to go inside. She wanted to make them understand, Allah doesn\u2019\
  t make mistakes, she isn\u2019t a mistake, she is exactly who she is meant to be.\
  \ She wanted to make them understand, but they didn\u2019t respect her, or listen\
  \ to her. How does she learn to co-exist with her religion, and her identity, she\
  \ constantly wondered if she had a place, a place in Islam, a place anywhere? Where\
  \ did she fit in? She wondered for she didn\u2019t quite know the answer herself.\n\
  Sometimes she toyed with the idea of leaving Kuala Lumpur, perhaps going to a country\
  \ where she and her identity would be respected. What did she have holding her here?\
  \ Her family and community shunned her, she hadn\u2019t spoken to any one in her\
  \ family for ten years, and her family had told most people that their son had died.\
  \ She laughed at this thought, because it was true to some extent, she was no longer\
  \ their son. Instead they had another daughter. She used to talk to her siblings,\
  \ until her father found out and forbade them from talking to her anymore. \nShe\
  \ had nothing to keep her here, yet she stayed. She just wanted to exist, live her\
  \ life normally, without the constant fear of retribution from her peers. She had\
  \ to fight for it, sometimes she cried with how unfair it was. She didn\u2019t decide\
  \ to be like this, why did she have to fight for her right to exist and be left\
  \ alone? Why did she have to fight but others didn\u2019t? She had few choices in\
  \ the matter, she just hoped with all that she could, that one day things would\
  \ be better. So, when younger people like her grew up they wouldn\u2019t have to\
  \ live with fear, to fight like she did. Because no one wants to fight, she didn\u2019\
  t, but if she didn\u2019t, they would. She didn\u2019t want anyone else to grow\
  \ up, hating themselves, never feeling comfortable in their own skin, and when they\
  \ realised why, she didn\u2019t want them to consider dark and disturbing things\
  \ to avoid disappointing her family. \nIt wasn\u2019t fair, but Malaysia was her\
  \ home. She could leave it, and perhaps live with less fear in her life but you\
  \ learn that you have to fight for your home sometimes."
