Text: "About a month in to my semester in Shanghai, I had started feeling comfortable\
  \ in such a giant city. The daily sights became ordinary - the bodega blaring \u201C\
  Gangnam Style\u201D (and only \u201CGangnam Style\u201D), the man selling books\
  \ on his wrinkled blue tarp, the barista whipping up a teddy-bear design in my latte.\
  \ Yet I was still missing a deeper connection to my surroundings.\n\nMaking friends\
  \ proved more difficult than expected. I had classmates from every continent (except\
  \ Antarctica - sadly, no penguin students); but as the only American, I struggled\
  \ to find the same common ground that bonded others. \n\nSara, a classmate from\
  \ Ecuador, sometimes joined me while checking out sights on my must-see list. She\
  \ knew Mandarin and on one of our first outings, graciously taught me how to order\
  \ food when a menu lacked English. We walked through a stretch of vendors and restaurants,\
  \ and she pointed out her favorites. She then instructed me how to simply point\
  \ at a dish on the menu or behind the counter and say \u201C zh\xE8ge, this one.\u201D\
  \ \n\nOne morning, before strolling under the vintage neon signs adorning Nanjing\
  \ road, Sara asked if I would mind stopping for a snack. Forever hungry and wanting\
  \ to try something new, I did not mind in the slightest.\n\nWe left campus through\
  \ the west gate and walked to an inconspicuous storefront that had not been a stop\
  \ on our how-to-order-food tour. The shop was so narrow that it didn\u2019t even\
  \ have a door, and a woman stood in the opening. She had her graying hair pulled\
  \ back into a low ponytail and wore a faded maroon apron. I peered behind the woman\
  \ and saw several tall stacks of steaming baskets. Sara ordered and then offered\
  \ to order for me. \n\n\u201CUh, what are you ordering, exactly?\u201D I asked,\
  \ embarrassed of my cuisine ignorance.\n\n\u201CBao zi\u201D she replied. \u201C\
  They are a type of dumpling.\u201D\n\nThe woman nodded at my friend\u2019s request\
  \ and opened a lid of one of the baskets to reveal an arrangement of doughy dumplings.\
  \ She selected two buns for each of us, plopped them into clear plastic bags, and\
  \ handed them over.\n\nSara pointed at the dumplings. \u201CThis one has meat and\
  \ this one is my favorite, but I don\u2019t know how to translate what it\u2019\
  s filled with.\u201D I pulled out the first dumpling and felt it was surprisingly\
  \ dense. The smell of ginger wafted from the bag, and I happily took a bite. A mixture\
  \ of pork and noodles awaited me on the inside. I gobbled up the dumpling, thrilled\
  \ at this delicious new discovery.  I bit into the second bao and was met with a\
  \ completely different wave of flavors. I, too, did not know what to call the sweet\
  \ yellow filling, though I was too satisfied to care. \n\nI began visiting the woman\
  \ selling bao on most mornings. She would see me coming and offer a bright smile,\
  \ an island of refuge in a sea of strangers. I didn\u2019t know her name - I didn\u2019\
  t even know how to ask her what it was - but we both settled into our little routine.\
  \ I would approach and order the same two flavors; she would teasingly correct my\
  \ pronunciation. She\u2019d then hand me my breakfast, and I\u2019d be on my way\
  \ to explore. \n\nThese near-daily interactions provided an anchor to my time there.\
  \ Though we could only trade words about dumplings, we were able to create a bond\
  \ beyond buns. There were mornings she looked sad and tired, and I tried to comfort\
  \ her with a sympathetic smile. Other mornings, especially when the morning sun\
  \ flooded through the gray fog, our exchanges were energetic and giggly. \n\nHer\
  \ storefront was barely noticeable, but we both helped each other feel seen. As\
  \ Sara helped me discover my love of bao, the woman unknowingly acted as the bridge\
  \ between my isolation and my sense of belonging. Her daily kindness helped transform\
  \ Shanghai from an impenetrable city into a second home."
