Text: "It was in June. At that time I studied in Poland and decided to fly to Italy\
  \ for the weekend. Italy was a country of dreams and that is why I was not stopped\
  \ even by the lack of a company and the prospect of spending rest alone.\n     \
  \   The destination is Milan, a city known as the world capital of fashion and design.\n\
  \        To visit the most popular tourist places of the city, as it turned out,\
  \ one day is enough. It was decided to devote the next day to studying the life\
  \ of the Italians themselves.\n        A leisurely walk through the outskirts of\
  \ the city, the final stops on the underground, courtyards are all in order to get\
  \ to know the city in such a way that tourists do not see it. Looking at the map,\
  \ I saw that there was a small village not far from me. According to my calculations,\
  \ there was enough time to get back to the city before dark.\n        Having reached\
  \ the specified stop, I leave the underground. Ahead is a country road, the wind\
  \ brings the smell of hay. It inspires me to realize that my dream to see the life\
  \ of an Italian village will soon come true.\n        Having decided to capture\
  \ the moment, I take out my phone and start shooting video for memory. In the distance\
  \ you can see the destination. The only thing is that the village on the map is\
  \ not at all the village on the terrain that I expected to see - most likely a suburb\
  \ consisting of high-rise buildings.\nHowever, what lies behind the small edge in\
  \ front? Continuing to shoot the video, I go in the indicated direction.\n     \
  \   The first houses appear: with a veranda recently painted in pink, a large wooden\
  \ one, a few more similar to each other in the style of southern Russian villages.\
  \ Talking, I\u2019m overtaken by two teenage guys. Do I really see real Italy? But\
  \ now the company stops me - a tattooed man and a teenager of about thirteen. Explained\
  \ in English common phrases. They ask me to stop making videos. Obediently turned\
  \ off the camera. Man, in my accent, I realized that I was Russian. On the counter\
  \ question where he came from, replied that he was from the former Yugoslavia.\n\
  \        Gonna go on. Not allowed, explaining that the place is not for tourists.\
  \ I ask, did I understand correctly that this is a village? The answer is yes. I\
  \ do not understand what the problem is. Is my dream so easily destroyed and already\
  \ fifty meters before its execution, I turn back? No, then this story would not\
  \ be about me.\n        They try to stop me with phrases: \"Dogs\" - it does not\
  \ work. My route continues. I look around the house, greet the locals - they smile\
  \ affably.\nThe village is only a small settlement. Something tells me to turn back\
  \ and leave this place.\n        I'm coming back. At the exit I was met by a man\
  \ with a brick in his hands. What's happening? He asks for a phone, says he saw\
  \ me shoot a video. I answer in the affirmative, but immediately add that I turned\
  \ it off immediately. A couple more people join us, including the company that met\
  \ me. The man continues to insistently demand a telephone. My heart starts pounding.\
  \ Then a tattooed man stands up for me and confirms my words. It seemed to me, crowded\
  \ around us, the whole settlement - from adults to the smallest. Making sure that\
  \ I was not a journalist, they let me go.\n        \"Leave! Run! \u201D- I hear\
  \ a voice in my head. Tears flow from treacherous eyes. In the twilight I get to\
  \ the underground. Fear passes.\n        In impatience to tell about it to someone,\
  \ I give the story to a new acquaintance. What he said surprised me: \"At a distance\
  \ of tens of kilometers from the city, there are no villages.\"\n       So what\
  \ was it?"
