Text: "The dull sound of arrows pierced through the damp, morning air as the audience\
  \ wrestled for positioning close to the main stage. Spectators looked on as archers\
  \ warmed their shivering hands, preparing their weapons for action. Signs of nervousness\
  \ and anxiety were visible on the faces of young participants as they huddled together\
  \ in anticipation of their opportunity to perform.\n\nOn the outskirts of Kyoto,\
  \ hundreds of young Japanese women were set to compete in an annual coming-of-age\
  \ ceremony called T\u014Dshiya. Every year, participants celebrate their 20th year\
  \ of life by partaking in a 400-year-old archery competition at Sanjusangendo Temple,\
  \ the longest wooden building in Japan. Having arrived at the crowded temple grounds\
  \ only moments earlier, I sensed a lack of competitiveness on the part of the contestants,\
  \ as they appeared far less interested in winning than in the ancient, sacred ritual\
  \ itself \u2013 one that is believed to bring young women closer to an idyllic sense\
  \ of personal identity.\n\nI learned about the event while living and working as\
  \ an English teacher in Japan. When the day came to attend the largely unknown tournament\
  \ in late January 2011, I found myself at the mercy of an insufferable cold. Disoriented\
  \ by a raging fever, undoubtedly triggered by the lack of heat and insulation in\
  \ my paper-thin apartment, I wrapped myself in the warmest clothes I could find\
  \ and boarded the two-hour train to Kyoto.\n\nMy camera became my voice that day.\n\
  \nUnable to speak, I photographed the rhythmic movements of each archer as their\
  \ kimonos swayed effortlessly in the wind, adjusting my lens to focus on the concentrated\
  \ eyes of the young women blossoming into adulthood. A synchronized dance unfolded\
  \ before me as rows of competitors readied their bows and sent feathered arrows\
  \ hissing through the air.\n\nI recall my senses as being unusually heightened in\
  \ that moment; suddenly aware of each breath, each fleeting glance, the discomforting\
  \ tingling sensation in my fingers. My eyes were fixated on the girls\u2019 solemn\
  \ expressions contrasting heavily with the authoritative task at hand. I watched\
  \ as tiny snowflakes fell serenely from the sky, landing softly on rosy cheeks.\
  \ The snow-covered ground crunched sharply beneath the weight of my boots. A chill\
  \ breeze echoed through the cheers of proud parents, as the sound of youthful laughter\
  \ and recurring glimpses of vibrant kimonos made the event feel emotionally tangible.\n\
  \nWhat I didn\u2019t expect to find was an ephemeral demonstration of the grace\
  \ and valour of a modern warrior; characteristics that remain an integral part of\
  \ Japanese folklore. The sight was breathtaking. As the archers lined up to fire\
  \ arrows in a swift, harmonious motion, I welcomed the exceptional chance to witness\
  \ the Japanese at their most elegant and artistic, equally emotional and uninhibited;\
  \ a sharp contrast to the rigid composure in which they project daily. It was all\
  \ so aesthetically pleasing to my Western eye.\n\nAs the day went on, I could feel\
  \ my fever worsening as I coughed and shivered, wiping sweat from my brow. I had\
  \ lived in Japan long enough to know that any public display of illness would cause\
  \ unwelcome distress for the other bystanders. Exiting the site, I noticed an elderly\
  \ Buddhist monk in a nearby temple, muttering prayers as he helped to wash the hands\
  \ of incoming visitors. Our eyes met for a moment, just long enough to see the corners\
  \ of his lips curl up in a warm display of affectionate approval. Perhaps for the\
  \ first time that day, I became conscious that I had been the only foreigner in\
  \ attendance.\n\nIt is said that the precious travel stories we hold so dearly are\
  \ those which could have easily been lost. I prefer to say that these are the moments\
  \ not often forgotten. I may always associate this memory as a reminder of the sacrifices\
  \ we endure in order to achieve some manner of fulfillment, whether they be simply\
  \ for personal gain \u2013 such as a few memorable photographs \u2013 or through\
  \ a timeless rite of passage that encompasses the esteemed traditions of a distant\
  \ and foreign land. Whatever the case, it is often through this blind pursuit that\
  \ we are gifted the most unexpected surprises."
