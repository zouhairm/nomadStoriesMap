Text: "It was the first day of a last-minute three-day road trip around Scotland.\
  \ Not enough time to plan a detailed itinerary. Not enough time to really see, touch\
  \ and smell the Scottish lands. And yet, the need to explore was stronger than rationality.\n\
  \nThat first day started under an unpredictable sky, in a hurry to reach my destination.\
  \ I drove from Edinburgh, through the Queensferry Crossing, heading north to St\
  \ Andrews and determined to get to Inverness. I thought that my destination would\
  \ be far away in the Highlands. I thought that in that remote place I would find\
  \ what I was expecting to find in my journey: the iconic landscapes of the wild\
  \ Scottish lands.\n\nInstead I found myself wandering in Fife, the Scottish county\
  \ called Kingdom, nestled between the Firth of Tay and the Firth of Forth. I drove\
  \ along the coast following the shape that the sea has drawn on the land over centuries.\
  \ \n\nAt first, I looked at the landscape as a simple crossing point, but the picturesque\
  \ description of the coastal villages on my guide pushed me to change my plan, use\
  \ my turn signal and follow the signs leading to St Monans. \n\nI stopped my car\
  \ just outside the village for what I thought would be a quick driving break. On\
  \ my way there, I pictured St Monans as a lonely town, regularly visited by the\
  \ strong winds blowing from the sea. I was astonished when I found an old lively\
  \ town warmed by the mid-morning sun and preparing to celebrate Sea Queen Day, following\
  \ a tradition that every year for over 60 years has crowned local young women as\
  \ Sea Queens.\n\nThe guide was right: St Monans was \u2018picturesque\u2019. It\
  \ was a colourful coastal village with narrow lines of fisher and merchant houses\
  \ facing the sea. But St Monans was much more than \u2018picturesque\u2019. It was\
  \ an unexpected Scottish landscape, far from the image that I had of the country.\
  \ Its harbour, full of life, sense of community and tradition was not the place\
  \ that I expected to see.\n\nI spent hours wandering around the village, discovering\
  \ its historic buildings, the church and the graveyard facing the sea. I let the\
  \ wonder for that place guiding me and I found beauty in every corner, in the pantiles\
  \ on the roofs and in the flowers grown in fishing boots of every size and colour.\
  \ \n\nThe need to explore more and continue my journey eventually led me out of\
  \ the village, to my car and north towards the Highlands. I left the Kingdom of\
  \ Fife with the feeling that I was not leaving a stop-over, but a destination: as\
  \ if St Monans was a place that I was destined to see, touch and smell."
