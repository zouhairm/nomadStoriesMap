Text: "When the human life ends, the sparks of the unleashed vital energy do not just\
  \ disappear. They continue to exist in memories, places, and signs telling of the\
  \ unreached aspirations of the soul. They are the mysteries yet to be uncovered\
  \ by the living.\n\nThere was a moment in my own life, when I got a chance to decrypt\
  \ such a message. It is at that time that I have realized that silence can talk\
  \ louder than words. \n\nIt was my first trip to Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. A trip\
  \ full of symbols, signs, enigma and meditation. And so, I had put on my protective\
  \ suit following the instructions of the guide. He kept wondering why a 20-year-old\
  \ girl would want to go to the Exclusion Zone. In fact, at that time I could not\
  \ give a clear answer myself. Something deep inside my soul urged me to make the\
  \ trip. The meaning of it came to me later.\n\nOn April 26, 2016, at 13:08 P.M.,\
  \ our car stopped near the abandoned townhouse in the ghost-city of Pripyat. The\
  \ reminders of its tragic destiny were everywhere \u2013 we could see it, we could\
  \ feel it. The scorched earth marked the path to the deserted building. The pieces\
  \ of broken window reflected the darkness of cloudy sky.\n\nThirty years prior to\
  \ that date, a nuclear disaster at Chernobyl Power Plant had claimed tens of thousands\
  \ of people\u2019s lives and turned previously blossoming region into nothing but\
  \ a wasteland. After initial shock had passed, subtle fear settled in my heart.\
  \ It seemed that God has forgotten to leave a glimpse of his sacral light in this\
  \ atmosphere of deathly silence. However, could it be so? - My subconscious intent\
  \ was to find the slightest proofs of life. With this in mind, I had reached the\
  \ building. The rusted signboard pointed out it was a kindergarten.\n\nQuickly passing\
  \ through the gloomy hall, I entered into what was once a playing room. The old\
  \ shabby toys of the Soviet era were accurately stacked, as if waiting for their\
  \ owners. A Teddy Bear laying on his tiny wooden bed covered with a blanket drew\
  \ my attention. The small piece of paper taped to the headboard had a note \xAB\
  to my dear Teddy from Masha\xBB. Masha must have been the girl who put her favorite\
  \ toy to bed just before the disaster took place. She must have expected to wake\
  \ him up the next morning. However, the tragic reality was different - she and hundreds\
  \ of other children would soon leave the place never to return. The wall clock that\
  \ stopped marked the end of their childhood \u2013 loss of homes, familiar places,\
  \ friends and all they held dear. The atmosphere of the room as if frozen in time\
  \ showed how destructive and sudden that moment was. The dreams of the Chernobyl\
  \ children became the ashes of their hopes.\n\nI left the Pripyat checkpoint the\
  \ same day at 15:25 PM. An hour earlier than I planned. I felt very exhausted, both\
  \ mentally and physically. Such state caused by experiencing all spectrum of deeply\
  \ moving emotions within a short time period. On my way back home, the image of\
  \ the Teddy Bear, which had something important to say, occupied my thoughts and\
  \ imagination. My desire is to meet Masha as a grown-up, and tell her that I have\
  \ met her old friend and he is fine. He is still waiting to see her again."
