Text: "A Brief Story About My Life\n\nMy life lived in seven year cycles. Every seven\
  \ years something phenomenal would happen that would change or shift the course\
  \ of my life. I was born in Hong Kong in 1981 into an ordinary family that had extraordinary\
  \ hearts. When I was seven years old, me and my family migrated to Sydney from Hong\
  \ Kong. Six of us; mum dad, my sister, my two little brothers and me. We all slept\
  \ on one queen sized bed, cramped into one small bedroom of a house that belonged\
  \ to a family friend. Life was rather shocking and tough. I remember always having\
  \ to be polite and careful staying in somebody else\u2019s house. Besides that I\
  \ was madly in love with their younger son, Andrion. He looked very different to\
  \ the ordinary boy in town, a exotic kinda Chinese boy. \n\nAnyway, after a lot\
  \ of hardship trying to look for a home, we finally found our first home in Marsfield,\
  \ in the west part of Sydney, not far from the public school me and my siblings\
  \ attended. Through the days of learning English in a foreign country, being laughed\
  \ at for bringing Chinese lunch kit to school, falling in love with more boys and\
  \ being a teacher\u2019s pet (maybe that is how I learnt to survive), I was suddenly\
  \ fourteen. It is true you can never really change from your nature. I was always\
  \ so curious about my sexuality, and now it was when I turned fourteen that I lost\
  \ my virginity. And also, when I stopped playing piano. \n\nCounting seven years\
  \ on was when I turned twenty one. I became an adult - in age. I also felt true\
  \ love for the first time. But to be honest, I don\u2019t recall feeling a strong\
  \ sense of when exactly I became an adult, as I guess it was a gradual thing. Im\
  \ not gonna say that I never became an adult, that is too cliche. But I am gonna\
  \ admit that the child inside me never left, and in many ways it is still growing\
  \ in my heart. Skipping two years ahead, I started to learn piano again when I was\
  \ twenty three. I was super determined to play piano again, after years of wanting\
  \ and craving to play. I believed I had an innate talent. So I went to learn Chopin\
  \ in C# Minor, a tenth grade piece that no one dared teach me. Though being a beginner\
  \ at piano, I did somehow forced it out of me, and I remember Clemens Leske (a Conservatorium\
  \ Pianist) was very very proud of me. I was too. \n\nLong story short, I went from\
  \ being an lonely Chinese girl / a weirdo at school, a suspended student to a high\
  \ achiever at High School Certificate, to a designer I tried to be and finally to\
  \ the true artist I was meant to be. I gradually found my spirit and soul in music\
  \ and art, and in all the beautiful friends I met along the way. Melbourne especially\
  \ have a place in my heart. To all my soulmates there right now, I salute you, and\
  \ I will never ever forget my experience there. It was like a dream. But after thirty\
  \ years of being in Australia, I finally returned home at the age of thirty seven.\
  \ In hindsight, I should of returned way sooner. Coming back to Hong Kong to re-unite\
  \ with my family was a brave and sensible thing to do. Hong Kong is still a home,\
  \ sometimes nothing feels better than living in the place where you were born. \n\
