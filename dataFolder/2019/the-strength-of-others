Text: "I had always liked traveling to unique enclaves that were a mix of many cultures\
  \ but the city of Melaka was just too much.  It was a place where, in the span of\
  \ one block, you could sample colonial-era Portuguese custard tarts, visit a quaint\
  \ Chinese tea house with hula hoop acrobats, nibble Malaysian satay from a smoky\
  \ street grill and, of course, hear the latest rock band at the Hard Rock Cafe.\
  \  This juxtaposition of various cultures and time periods made Melaka a disorienting\
  \ place.  Adding to this chaos were the trishaw bicycles whizzing by, covered in\
  \ tacky plastic flowers and decorated to correspond to the latest Disney hit, hoping\
  \ to catch the eye of a demanding child or a tourist looking for the perfect selfie\
  \ opportunity.  At night the bikes\u2019 strings of neon lights came to life, adding\
  \ to the hustle and bustle of the centuries-old port.  \n\nThe historical center\
  \ of Melaka was a Protestant church, built by the Dutch in 1753 after taking over\
  \ the city from the Portuguese.  A reminder both sad and proud of colonialism in\
  \ Asia, its reddish exterior and very European architecture overlooking a cheery\
  \ square with an English garden was about as un-Asian as it could be.  Yet, I was\
  \ immediately drawn to this church for its history.  It still had a practicing congregation\
  \ and Sunday services in English, Malay, and Mandarin so, having nothing else to\
  \ do, I decided to attend the next morning.  \n\nI hadn\u2019t been to church in\
  \ a long time.  Growing up in the midwestern United States, my Lutheran upbringing\
  \ was very much a part of my childhood, but as an adult it clashed with my liberal\
  \ beliefs.  Perhaps traveling and seeing so many different religions made me more\
  \ of a religious cynic.  Either way, church was no longer a very comfortable place.\
  \ \n\nSo, for the first time in a long time the next morning I made my way apprehensively\
  \ to the church, feeling, as I had the whole weekend, very out of place and hoping\
  \ that it was indeed the service in English that was happening at 9:00.  I was in\
  \ luck, and as I sat down on a faded wooden bench I took in the simple white interior\
  \ of the historic church.  While I had come for the history of a building, what\
  \ struck me most was the beauty of the diversity of the people gathered.  The pastor\
  \ was of Indian heritage, the couple next to me also visiting from Singapore, the\
  \ greeter from Kenya.  \n\nFive minutes into the service an older woman in a wheelchair\
  \ was pushed down the aisle by a younger woman who was presumably her Filipino helper.\
  \  Living in Singapore I had heard lots of horror stories about how Filipino helpers\
  \ working in wealthier Asian countries were often treated, and I felt sympathy for\
  \ this woman who had the heavy burden of caring for another in a country that wasn\u2019\
  t her own.  In a process that had clearly been done many times, as if on cue, a\
  \ church member from the second row stood up to hold the older woman\u2019s wheelchair\
  \ and this small Filipino woman courageously faced her charge.  In a feat of herculean\
  \ strength, she reached down and pulled up the older woman to stand face to face\
  \ on her feet, her limp body towering over her.  Carefully, and with the practiced\
  \ grace of a waltz, she sidestepped with her into the pew and placed her lovingly\
  \ on the wooden seat.  Throughout the service she sat with one arm around the woman\u2019\
  s shoulders with a devotion and enthusiasm for service and faith that I had never\
  \ seen.  \n\nIf I were religious, I would claim that I saw God in that moment. \
  \ In this Dutch-British church in a predominantly Muslim country in Asia this tiny\
  \ woman ironically showed me that you don\u2019t need a common language, culture\
  \ or organized religion to understand love and devotion.  Suddenly, in Melaka\u2019\
  s overwhelming mix of contradictions, something made sense."
