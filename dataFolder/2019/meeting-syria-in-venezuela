Text: "The sun beats down as I wander along the quintessentially colourful Venezuelan\
  \ street Bernab\xE9 Planas, passing by fragrant tropical fruits being prepared for\
  \ juicing at the jugueria. Nestled right between there and the arepera cornbread\
  \ caf\xE9 lies number 22, El Basha Arabic restaurant that is soon to entice me.\n\
  \nLorena Orfali, an energetic, ambitious and resilient woman warmly receives me.\
  \ She is the proud owner of this little Syrian restaurant that claims to have the\
  \ most delicious shawarma in Barquisimeto, one of the most bustling cities in Venezuela.\n\
  \nFlavours of the Middle East dance and bounce on my tongue while she gifts me with\
  \ her life story. Savouring kibbehs and drinking tea, Lorena tells me about her\
  \ mum fleeing Syria when she was just 20 years old, looking for a better future\
  \ in Venezuela, the country that would welcome everyone that needed it in the 60s\
  \ and 70s. Escaping from a dictatorship to later realise that after such a long\
  \ time, her second homeland was following the same steps that would lead them to\
  \ a national economic collapse.\n\nShe sadly confesses in her deep voice that sometime\
  \ soon she will have to leave the city in which she grew up in order to look for\
  \ more opportunities abroad, just as her parents did.\n\nWe pause and stare at each\
  \ other. Her dark brown eyes tell me everything I need to know. \u201CI\u2019ve\
  \ been so happy in this country, you know. It\u2019s not fair what they are doing\
  \ to Venezuela, this chaos is unbearable. It hurts me so much and the whole world\
  \ should know about this.\u201D\n\nYears later I meet her in Madrid, she has had\
  \ to migrate due to a severe humanitarian crisis. Etched on her face one can see\
  \ the marks of hard times and desperation. Nothing seems to alleviate her pain.\n\
  \nShe had nothing with her and everything to fear for the second time in her life.\
  \ She has lost her country twice, she has lost her patria twice.\n\nLorena\u2019\
  s story has made me realise the rights and privileges I enjoy as a European woman\
  \ living safe from war and about how it must feel to lose one\u2019s identity twice.\
  \ Like when one accidentally leaves the door open and someone would come to steal\
  \ everything one owned; stories, memories, family, religion. DIGNITY.\n\nWhat else\
  \ do we need to stop making war and start bringing peace to this planet?"
