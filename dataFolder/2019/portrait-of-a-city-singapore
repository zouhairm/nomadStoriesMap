Text: "Singapore, the Asian New York. An island, a city and a country all in one.\
  \ The Lion City, one of the cleanest in the world, treasures community and unity,\
  \ from the elderly to the youth. People from all across the world visit Singapore\
  \ in search of a cutting edge destination, jam packed with skyscrapers and state\
  \ of the art technology. Yet they leave, not only with empty pockets but with an\
  \ open mind on the cultural beauty that Singapore has to offer. \n\nI step out of\
  \ my grandparents pocket sized apartment that I have come to call my second home\
  \ over the years that I have visited. The exquisite aroma of the country's renowned\
  \ street food fills the air as I look up at the cerulean sky. I amble down the pristine\
  \ sidewalks, my grandfather holding tightly onto my hand as we walk, as if I'm merely\
  \ a figment of his imagination that could disappear at any given moment.\n\nA conventional\
  \ day for me in this city consists of spending my mornings at a nearby food court.\
  \ My grandfather and I have spent many days here, discussing our life and his adventures\
  \ as a young man, consuming generous servings of roti prata that melts in our mouths\
  \ with every bite. However sometimes we are left in a serene silence, allocating\
  \ some time to observe the mesmerizing procedure of the stall owners creating teh\
  \ tarik. \n\nTeh tarik is a traditional Singaporean tea. This tea is manufactured\
  \ in a very unique way. First, the barista creates the black tea with a dollop of\
  \ milk. He then pours the tea from one glass to another at exorbitantly steep lengths\
  \ causing it to resemble a waterfall, however not as unfastidious. This process\
  \ is very meticulous, every inaccuracy calls for the production of a new one. Although,\
  \ throughout the years I have visited this magnificent city I haven't seen any inadequacies,\
  \ as all the workers are quite zealous to their work. \n\nLater that day I arrive\
  \ at Marine Parade, a green wonderland in the forest of skyscrapers. I head down\
  \ to the park passing a local coffee shop on the way, grabbing a bottle of cold\
  \ Ribena to aid me with this heat. The park is engulfed with a sea of Rain Trees\
  \ creating a covered walkway for the cyclists and runners. The trees are accompanied\
  \ by an array of fluorescent flowers emitting every scent possible, hypnotizing\
  \ you into a state of pure bliss. The park is the only place where I can sit and\
  \ escape the hustle and bustle Singapore offers. I spend my time here reading a\
  \ book and soaking in the sun, occasionally taking a sip of my Ribena and observing\
  \ the seldom cyclist or runner passing by. \n\nAs I walk back to the station I catch\
  \ a glimpse of a cluster of Muslim men coming out of a Mosque. They are dressed\
  \ in the traditional clothes, that consist of a kurta and a songkok. There are men\
  \ of all generations, a great grandfather with his grandson and a group of friends\
  \ paying their respects to Allah. The Mosque behind them is beautiful, white and\
  \ mighty, resembling a lion in an ocean of sheep. It's a fascinating piece of art\
  \ that is so intricate and fragile, a fitting place to worship a god. \n\nOnce the\
  \ city reaches dusk, Singapore comes to life. Roaming around Orchard Road at night\
  \ transports you into the technological wonderland you pictured in your mind. From\
  \ the abundance of high rise buildings to the gargantuan screened billboards, it\
  \ mirrors your wildest dreams. The sound of horns and engines create a chaotic atmosphere\
  \ that people crave, a strange contrast to the limpid sounds Singapore usually effulgences\
  \ during the day. Here there are people of every race, all searching for an out\
  \ of body experience. \n\nI came to realize that Singapore is an uncharted sea of\
  \ curiosity waiting to be explored. Singapore may not be perfect but from the colossal\
  \ skyscrapers, the natural green parks and beautiful Mosques, Singapore is a piece\
  \ of art. Every traveller who visits leaves their own signature style to this ever\
  \ growing city, bringing it closer and closer to perfection."
