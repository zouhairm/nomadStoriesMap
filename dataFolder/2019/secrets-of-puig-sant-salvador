Text: "I needed a weekend on my own. \nThat is why I took the camera, my books and\
  \ my walking shoes and headed to the south of the island of Mallorca, direction\
  \ Felanitx. I had found a new small hotel attached to a monastery from the XVIII\
  \ century, that was allocated on a hill in the middle of a natural area. And when\
  \ I arrived, I knew it was the place I needed. The sun was starting to go down,\
  \ giving me the opportunity to sunbath with the sunset - in the middle of an extreme\
  \ cold wind! \nMy camera decided to make the last picture before dying without battery.\
  \ A good reminder, that I needed to slow down in my daily routine and allow the\
  \ recharge of it (and by the way, myself). I enjoyed sunset with free hands, good\
  \ stored in my pockets. After that I had a quick bite and went to read in my novel.\
  \ \n6:15 am. The alarm rings. I did not sleep so good, new beds, new dreams. Then\
  \ I realize where I am. \nI stand up and look through the window... The next thing\
  \ I know is that I was standing outside.  I did not even took the time to remove\
  \ my pijama - it was just jacket, camera, go.\nThe reason? I was above the clouds\
  \ for the first time, withou being on a plane, if you know what I mean! The part\
  \ behind the hill was a carpet of clouds, the part where the sun would rise was\
  \ just forming and I had the feeling, this inmense cloud was just hugging from right\
  \ and left the hill where I was on. You could not hear a noise - sometimes you would\
  \ also not see a thing. And then clarity came, the clouds stayed at the bottom of\
  \ the valley and I could presence one of the most beautiful sunrises I have ever\
  \ seen. It was just magical, I could not believe how lucky I was being. \nAfter\
  \ a few minutes - everything started to go back to \"normal\". And I decided to\
  \ go for breakfast. And continue with the day."
