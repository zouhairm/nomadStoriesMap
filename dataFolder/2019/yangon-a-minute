Text: "If Baz Luhrmann and Wes Anderson had a lovechild, Yangon would be its name.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s a pastel-shaded, post-colonial dreamscape that was built for princes\
  \ and inherited by the poor and it doesn\u2019t take much wandering the streets\
  \ to see the footprints left behind. \n\nThere are almost two hundred magnificently\
  \ grand nineteenth and early twentieth century buildings that show the flourishing\
  \ metropolis this city once was and that today remain protected by the state. They\
  \ have arc windows, high ceilings, marble pillars, clock towers, palatial porches\
  \ and double doors. The pavements that lead to them are beautifully engraved with\
  \ chiselled out flowers and leaves. Everything has that Victorian attention to detail.\
  \ \n\nSadly, the history of Burma isn\u2019t as pretty as the ornate and colourful\
  \ walls it hides behind, and the fact that they now look like somebody left the\
  \ film set of The Great Gatsby to rot and ruin is a perfect visual representation\
  \ of what really happened here. Trade-hungry British businessmen invaded Myanmar\
  \ in 1852 and after months of bloody battles, took control of the country giving\
  \ it the new name Burma \u2013 named after its main tribe. Crusaders of The \u201C\
  Great\u201D Isle had trailblazed their way through ruthlessly with manic imperialism\
  \ and Burma\u2019s story of takeover tragedy had begun. The monarchy was dismantled,\
  \ religion was separated from state and social conscience began to decay. \n\nI\
  \ wandered up around Kandawgi Lake, along the tree-lined avenues and past the bright\
  \ white and glittering gold stupas surrounding the Shwedagon Pagoda before heading\
  \ back downtown. The inner-city dwellings stood there heartbroken and distressed\
  \ with crooked smiles, dressed in dreamy shades of dusky pink, sky blue, sage green,\
  \ pale lemon and bright turquoise. Their colours had been weathered by the smoggy\
  \ air, moss was crawling over their windowsills and foliage was starting to grow\
  \ from their gutters. They looked like beauty queens from yesteryear who refused\
  \ to get off the stage.\n\nYet you could see that there was life still inside them.\
  \ Colourful, vibrant, noisy life.\n\nMen stood leaning over their balconies watching\
  \ the world go by, women hung washing out on their lines, bright coloured birds\
  \ sung from small wicker cages, music played and people sang. Girls wandered the\
  \ streets yelling our sales pitches for the goods they were carrying in enormous\
  \ bowls on their head. The crows squawked, the horns honked and boys rolled passed\
  \ with carts of fruit heckling out to passers-by. \n\nI walked through China Town\
  \ and along to the kaleidoscopic labyrinth of almost two thousand stalls at Bogyoke\
  \ Market. I was blinded by colour and deafened by the sounds of the young monks\
  \ and nuns parading through in groups of six or seven, shaking their silver alms\
  \ bowls and singing at the top of their voices. \n\nThey wore bright baby pink gowns\
  \ with burnt orange sashes and their shaved heads accentuated the huge smiles on\
  \ their faces. They sang with joyful excitement; it was a chorusing cavalcade that\
  \ would come to be my very most favourite thing about Yangon and their rhythmic\
  \ recitals would send me into a awestruck trance every time.  \n\nAs I turned the\
  \ corner into the courtyard, all of a sudden the skies opened up and warm rain started\
  \ to pour down heavily. It was a welcomed wash for a dirty city. I took shelter\
  \ in a door way with droplets bouncing off my forehead, my eyes wide just watching,\
  \ listening and feeling everything around me. \nStall sellers quickly put up their\
  \ canopies, others wheeled their carts under shelter and the men huddled closer\
  \ together. The mini monks and nuns continued their winding parade and their voices\
  \ dodged a thousand raindrops to tickle my eardrums.\n\nEverybody carried on working\
  \ hard, chatting, smiling, laughing, singing, sweating \u2013 it was every part\
  \ of life in front of me. \n\nBefore this city was in the hands of the ravenous\
  \ rulers from the West, the King of Myanmar had called it Rangoon, which means end\
  \ of strife. And that\u2019s where Yangon seems to be now \u2013 on a journey towards\
  \ independence, towards freedom and towards the end of strife."
