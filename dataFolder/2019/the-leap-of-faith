Text: "Monday morning, the week before Christmas and the end of my last weekend commuting\
  \ between Cork City and New York. I had no where to be and all week to do it. The\
  \ schedule hanging high in the bus terminal said the next bus left in seven minutes\
  \ and it's second last stop was Schull Cork. Id never been but after locating it\
  \ on a map and asking the driver how much the ticket cost I was now sitting in a\
  \ bus to somewhere new. \nAirbnb threw up some possible options but I picked one\
  \ that no one had ever stayed in.\nIt was about an hour and fifteen minutes outside\
  \ Schull on foot. \nThere was a change in Skibbereen where I walked around and took\
  \ in the stress free vibe of Christmas. A quick meal in Maggie Mae's satistfied\
  \ my yearnings and then I was on the bus again. The walk to the house was along\
  \ an old back road formly a main road when horses were still being used. There were\
  \ hardly any lights except the odd light from a house but as soon as I was about\
  \ a hundred feet clear of the town I came to a bend and lift in the road which cast\
  \ in front of me the whole of the south west of Ireland lazing in the atlantic waters,scattered\
  \ with islands and a sense of soul.\nI had a very warm welcome from the young host\
  \ who was excited to have her first guest. The house was laid out like a Hollywood\
  \ movie set of Ireland in the fifties. Lots of throws to keep warm with,a teapot\
  \ and a loaf of home made bread lots of scones and so much more. \nThat night as\
  \ I settled in I could see the flash of the lighthouse way out on an island in the\
  \ sea creating a romantic shillouette against a castle on the coast.\nWhen the light\
  \ broke the next morning the view was engulfing of the senses,every color seemed\
  \ to play through the fields and across the sea, not just a blue sea but a green\
  \ sea then a foamy white sea and back to an effervescent brash blue sea accompanied\
  \ by dancing clouds and rolling hills. \nMy first walk lead me to the pier close\
  \ by that no longer had boats but kids used during the summer to swim. I stood there\
  \ wrapped up from the wind,the sun out in the world warming Schull at an angle.\
  \ And then something screamed inside and I was naked in this rural cove and jumping\
  \ into the freezing water. I swam and jumped till the cold started gnawing my toes\
  \ and then dried myself in the sun by jumping up and down and once dressed ran back\
  \ to my old road and headed to town to find warming soup\nBy day three I was getting\
  \ use to the cold water and I stayed in longer each time. Swimming below the pier\
  \ I was hidden from the laneway that was a road for some. Feeling brave I swam out\
  \ further toward the sea and then noticed a car had pulled up which I hadn't heard.\
  \ As I swam further I saw a woman in her thirties staring at my clothing piled on\
  \ together on a dry corner of the dock. Then I saw her look around but not see me,I\
  \ could imagine what she was thinking. I waved to get her attention and then she\
  \ smiled and started to head back to her car. But she didn't get in, she undressed\
  \ and was running in her bathing suit to the edge of the pier and then she leaped.\
  \ I was more than impressed and though I'd been in for a while the fact I didn't\
  \ have a suit on meant I'd better stay in a bit longer. \nWe exchanged some words\
  \ and then once she was out I made my way to my clothing and once decent we continued\
  \ talking. She offered me a ride to town which I accepted and before we reached\
  \ town she had offered me a ticket to a music show that night in a nearby village.\
  \ A leap of faith."
