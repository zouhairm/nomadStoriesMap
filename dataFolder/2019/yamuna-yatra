Text: "Four years ago, I embarked on an unforgettable road trip with eighty people\
  \ including my school friends, teachers, NGO employees and qualified drivers. Together\
  \ we drove along the banks of the Yamuna River located in North India, exploring\
  \ different cities,villages,snow-capped mountains, hilly areas and religious temples.\
  \ Our journey introduced us to love all Indian's had for their national sport cricket,\
  \ Bollywood culture and other festivals.This excursion helped me closely connect\
  \ with myself, my mentors, family, batch mates, problems faced in the Indian society\
  \ and the environment. \n\nFor the first time I spent twelve days away from family\
  \ and home, staying in various accommodations including tents, small rooms and spacious\
  \ guesthouses. Everyday started with packing my bags alone  as we needed to cover\
  \ ten destinations in a short span of time. This task challenged me become a responsible\
  \ and confident individual, aware of her surroundings, Days of physical exertion,\
  \ made me value the comfort of living in my own space and unconditional love my\
  \ parents have consistently given me. \n\nSpending twelve days with Yatri's (travelers)\
  \ of contrasting age groups, professions and traditions allowed us to form bonds\
  \ with each other. We gained immense amount of respect for our domestic help  of\
  \ cooks and drivers who worked tirelessly to ensure our safety throughout the trip.\
  \ Our interaction with NGO employees taught us the importance of taking action,\
  \ fighting for rights, motivating us to become social change-makers. The teachers\
  \ were there to solve all problems and guide us in the right direction. Fun times\
  \ were celebrated with friends during snowball fights after treks and singing at\
  \ bonfires. Having diverse backgrounds and interests, our most difficult task was\
  \ to find common music during daily car drives. This everyday chore trained us to\
  \ be sensitive and find a path midway. \nMy travel experiences helped me form strong\
  \ associations with people.  \n\nEducational visits to different villages, cities\
  \ and sacred temples gave us an insight about problems faced in a large, developing\
  \ nation. A caste system in rural India considers a section of society 'untouchable'\
  \ and 'impure'. These individuals stay in dirty areas, are denied access to education,\
  \ perform menial jobs,  and live in a vicious cycle of poverty. Industries in urban\
  \ areas are responsible for increased rates in employment and income. However there\
  \ is lack of awareness about waste management leading to air and water pollution.\
  \ Unfortunately, Indians are taught to not question religious practices, but follow\
  \ them blindly. In a holy town Vrindavan God-fearing individuals often waste money,\
  \ buy plastic bags with flowers, throw them in water bodies as they are taught that\
  \ this action a sign of loyalty towards  religion. After our observations we concluded\
  \ a high level of illiteracy results in intense faith in unfounded religious beliefs,\
  \ continuity of irrational ideologies, and lack of awareness about 'sustainable\
  \ development'. We happily connected with the real purpose of education and realized\
  \ that knowledge helps us critically analyze situations, question our activities\
  \ and make informed decisions. \n\nI have always believed that vacations helps an\
  \ individual escape their monotonous, mundane life and experience a new culture\
  \ .  The positive vibe created with the onset of a holiday allows the traveller\
  \ to set themself free, explore their interest, reflect on subject matters and create\
  \ local connections with unexpected things like I did at Yamuna Yatra (expedition)."
