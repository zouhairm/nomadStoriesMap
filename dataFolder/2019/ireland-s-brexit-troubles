Text: "Standing outside O'Donoghues pub in the center of Dublin and listening to an\
  \ Irishwoman describe exactly how my own country\u2019s political troubles would\
  \ most likely throw her home into chaos, I felt like a foreign invader, briefly\
  \ allowed into the enemy camp but never entirely welcomed.\n\nIt was a cold October\
  \ night and I was in Dublin on assignment, covering a conference about international\
  \ aviation law for a London-based newsletter that would soon be shelved by our publisher,\
  \ the first casualty of a merger with one of the company\u2019s main competitors.\n\
  \nWe stood on the pavement outside the pub because there wasn\u2019t any room at\
  \ the bar. It was crowded with locals and businessmen alike, all pushing and shoving,\
  \ shouting to be heard above the din they themselves were creating. A familiar scene\
  \ in drinking establishments all over the world.\n\nI was explaining why I wouldn\u2019\
  t be trying Guinness any time soon (I\u2019m mostly teetotal) when a group of young\
  \ women introduced themselves and interrogated us about our English accents. As\
  \ often happens when people learn you work in the news media, the conversation soon\
  \ turned to politics.\n\nI\u2019ve since forgotten her name \u2013 in many ways\
  \ it was the least interesting thing about her \u2013 but one of the girls told\
  \ us a story about her sisters-in-law that really stuck with me.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019\
  re complete idiots,\u201D she proclaimed loudly. \u201CThey\u2019re nurses, working\
  \ for the NHS in London, and they voted for Brexit because they don\u2019t want\
  \ foreigners coming over to the UK, taking their jobs and over-burdening public\
  \ services.\u201D\n\nRolling her eyes, she reiterated, \u201CTo be clear, they\u2019\
  re from the Republic of Ireland. They live in the UK. And they work for the NHS.\
  \ They\u2019re not even hypocrites, they\u2019re just stupid.\u201D\n\nPrivately,\
  \ I thought that she probably wasn\u2019t giving them enough credit but agreed that\
  \ the level of cognitive dissonance that they\u2019d achieved in essentially voting\
  \ against themselves and their own jobs was impressively daft.\n\nBritain\u2019\
  s planned exit from the European Union could plunge Ireland into chaos, she told\
  \ me. The peace between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is already\
  \ fragile, and a hard border between the two would set them back hundreds of years.\n\
  \nPeople who work in the North but live in the South, and vice versa, might not\
  \ be able to get to their jobs without passing through border security, costing\
  \ both time and money that just don\u2019t have to spare. Families could be separated,\
  \ evoking the memory of a divided Germany in the years before the wall came down.\n\
  \nIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal, this could very well be the result, hence\
  \ the much-debated Irish backstop, which would allow freedom of movement between\
  \ the two countries to continue regardless of the UK\u2019s membership status.\n\
  \nSometime later, a quite tipsy, Northern Irish dude joined the conversation. When\
  \ he learned that we were talking about Brexit, his response was to start shouting\
  \ at our new friends, \u201CDon\u2019t leave us!\u201D\n\n\u201CWe\u2019re not leaving\
  \ you, you\u2019ve leaving us!\u201D They yelled back, laughing, the conversation\
  \ continuing on in this vein until he left to find a taxi and a takeaway.\n\nMonths\
  \ later, I told the woman\u2019s story to a taxi driver, himself an immigrant from\
  \ Iraq, who took me to the airport for an early morning flight to New York. He bent\
  \ over and wheezed as he laughed incredulously.\n\nOn the subject of those who voted\
  \ to leave the EU in order to restrict or even halt immigration into the UK, he\
  \ noted that he wouldn\u2019t have sought asylum had there been another option.\n\
  \n\u201CWhy would we leave our home if we didn\u2019t have to? In the seventies,\
  \ Iraq had everything. We had jobs, families, culture\u2026 Then the war came and\
  \ we had nothing. Brexit won\u2019t stop immigration; only an end to the bloody\
  \ Americans\u2019 wars will do that.\u201D\n\nHe paused, then asked, \u201CIf there\
  \ are no immigrants, who will do the jobs that English people don\u2019t want to\
  \ do? Who will drive the taxis and clean your houses? Who will collect the rubbish\
  \ or work in the hospitals? Because it won\u2019t be the Brexiteers, I can tell\
  \ you that.\u201D"
