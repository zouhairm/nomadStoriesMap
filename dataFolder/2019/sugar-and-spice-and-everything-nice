Text: "This blog is not to educate you about tea, spice, condiments etc. but to share\
  \ my random thoughts when I was on shopping spree in Goa.\nJust after I was done\
  \ with shopping, I started window shopping. All ladies will definitely agree with\
  \ me. Our eyes act like magnets to anything and everything that is attractive and\
  \ has a price tag.\nEven if my mind says NO, my eyes fall hard for those charming\
  \ colourful bright jumpsuits, enchanting accessories, and I can go on and on.\n\
  The photo which you see is clicked by me. I know i\u2019m hell talented. You guys\
  \ don\u2019t believe me? Well, clicking a nice picture from a Micromax phone speaks\
  \ volumes about my talent and my inclination towards photography.\nLeaving narcissism\
  \ aside, this photo was taken accidentally by me just like how we end up falling\
  \ in love with someone whom we never liked in first place or getting pregnant or\
  \ gaining few pounds even when you know that you didn\u2019t eat much.\nAfter hectic\
  \ bargaining sessions with the shopkeepers in Goa,I was extremely hungry and partially\
  \ bored. Hence I decided to take a stroll and get to know Goan markets better. While\
  \ everything was same from cashew nuts to colourful maxis, shades, bikinis, alcohol,\
  \ slippers \u2013 the thing that I found amusing in Goa was TEA. How could India\u2019\
  s SIN CITY be selling stuff like TEA and that too varieties of it when people visit\
  \ GOA to buy cheap booze, cashew nuts, and party hard.\nAnyway that curiosity was\
  \ good enough to take a picture and VOILA\u2026it was a Kodak moment.\nWell if you\
  \ are a tea lover, teetotaller and you\u2019re in Goa(don\u2019t know why you should\
  \ be in Goa in first place if you\u2019re a teetotaller) but if you\u2019re then\
  \ you can definitely buy these goodies and let tea soothe your senses if not some\
  \ smooth whisky. \U0001F609"
