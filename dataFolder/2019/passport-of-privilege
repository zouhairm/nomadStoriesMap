Text: "We come for drinks, we stay for the show: a silent, one-man act, performed\
  \ by a deaf Sri Lankan dishwasher. He doesn\u2019t speak, but we don\u2019t miss\
  \ a word. \n\nThe stage is a quiet outdoor bar, tucked away in the lush Sri Lankan\
  \ rainforest and bathed in the warm glow of flickering tiki lanterns. We sit on\
  \ colorful striped pillows, pressing our sweating glasses to our cheeks and listening\
  \ to the croon of a dreadlocked singer and his guitar.\n\nSaumya approaches us first,\
  \ motioning at the pillows with raised eyebrows. His friend, Hiruni, is his voice.\
  \ \u201CWe can sit?\u201D \n\nIn Sri Lanka, the locals and tourists drink together.\
  \ There is no divide, or so it seems. I love this, and welcome them to join us at\
  \ our bamboo table. \n\nSaumya stretches out a hand to each of us, his smile reaching\
  \ the furthest corners of his face. We say our names, but he happily shakes his\
  \ head and waves a fist next to his ear. \n\u201CHis name Saumya,\u201D Hiruni chirps\
  \ for him. \u201CHe can no hear.\u201D \n\nSaumya is an instant friend, poking our\
  \ sunburnt skin and teaching us to spell his name in his own motley style of sign\
  \ language. He doesn\u2019t speak, but he laughs often, throwing his head back and\
  \ belching out rich vibratos that turn the heads of the people next to us. \n\n\
  He rocks his arms as if holding a baby, then motions around him. We take turns guessing\
  \ at what he\u2019s saying. \u201CYou\u2019ve lived here your whole life?\u201D\
  \ \nSaumya nods, then taps his temple with raised eyebrows and spells out four numbers.\
  \ Remember 2004? \n\n\u201CThe tsunami,\u201D my friend murmurs. \n\nSaumya head\
  \ bobs, the smile never leaving his face. He flings a hand into the air and lets\
  \ it come crashing down. Hiruni knows this English word well. \u201CYes,\u201D he\
  \ says. \u201CTsunami.\u201D\n\nBefore arriving in Sri Lanka a few days earlier,\
  \ I spent three weeks in Vietnam. I trekked through rice fields and sipped coffee\
  \ with condensed milk. I ate learned how to make pho and cross the busy streets\
  \ without hesitating. In all three weeks, I never once visited a war memorial. \n\
  \nSaumya now makes exaggerated swimming motions, then flails his arms. \n\u201C\
  Many people can no swim,\u201D Hiruni translates. \u201CSaumya hangs to tree.\u201D\
  \ \n\nBefore Vietnam, I had the option of following my friends to either Cambodia\
  \ or Bali. Both would be beautiful, but given Cambodia\u2019s dark and tragic history,\
  \ Bali seemed\u2026well, easier. \n\nThe shadows of a smile are still on Saumya\u2019\
  s face, but his eyes are dark. He opens his mouth wide as if screaming, but there\
  \ is no sound. Again, he shakes a fist next to his ear.\n\u201CHe couldn\u2019t\
  \ hear,\u201D I breathe. \u201CHe couldn\u2019t hear the screaming.\u201D\n\nI think\
  \ about my small town in Thailand where I taught English. Every year during monsoon\
  \ season, the entire town floods. Houses are evacuated, shops close. My school,\
  \ which sits in a valley, is particularly susceptible. One Monday, I pull up to\
  \ school on my motorbike only to find the entire first floor completely submerged.\
  \ \n\u201CNo school for now,\u201D my Thai teacher sighs. She tells me not to help,\
  \ it happens every year.\nI insist, weakly, take photos of the bright orange monks\
  \ floating by in plastic boats \u2013 and then go on vacation. \n\nSaumya pumps\
  \ his arms as if he\u2019s running, touches his thumb to each of our wrists, and\
  \ then runs again. Hiruni\u2019s face is solemn, his eyes locked to Saumya. My thumb\
  \ rests mindlessly on my wrist; I can feel my pulse thundering against my conscience.\n\
  \u201CHe check who is alive,\u201D Hiruni whispers. \n\n\nNo one likes to be called\
  \ a tourist. Yet sitting there \u2013 watching Saumya mime the act of digging for\
  \ bodies buried under rubble \u2013 I was never more aware of my privilege. I carry\
  \ it with me everywhere, it is my passport. Privilege grants me freedom to visit\
  \ these beautiful places, but it also gives me a choice that the locals of a country\
  \ don\u2019t have \u2013 the choice to sidestep the messy parts. \n\nIn Sri Lanka,\
  \ the locals and tourists drink together, but so long as we carry privilege in our\
  \ pockets, there will always be a divide."
