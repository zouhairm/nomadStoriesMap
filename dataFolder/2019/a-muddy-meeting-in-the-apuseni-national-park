Text: "After a weekend spent aimlessly wandering the cobbled streets of Cluj-Napoca\
  \ and drinking wine in sunny squares, it seemed like a great idea to end our trip\
  \ exploring the \u2018real\u2019 Transylvania. My boyfriend, Billy, and I would\
  \ hire a car and drive through the Apuseni National park, stopping off in a pretty\
  \ towns and villages.\n\nOur first stop was Huedin, where we enjoyed a cold beer\
  \ in what was most definitely a \u2018locals\u2019 pub, before strolling through\
  \ endless market stalls and stopping at a grill tent to enjoy pork steaks. We continued\
  \ through small villages (stopping as necessary for road side ice-cream) before\
  \ entering the National park. Slowing to pass horse-drawn machinery and locals in\
  \ traditional dress, it began to feel like that \u2018real\u2019 Transylvania we\
  \ hoped for. \n\nHypnotised by rolling hills and hay stacks, we hardly noticed the\
  \ roads getting narrower. That was until our first warning sign: a closed gate.\
  \ Unable to turn around, it became my role to carefully untangle the barbed wire\
  \ securing the fence to allow us through. Fence open, our next obstacle greeted\
  \ us: two adorable puppies who decided that the perfect play spot was in front of\
  \ our car.\n\nAfter distracting them by throwing a pringle out of the window (because\
  \ how else do you distract puppies?) we were able to continue - cue obstacle number\
  \ three: a deep puddle. With fencing either side, our only option was to continue\
  \ and hope for the best. Billy\u2019s foot hit the accelerator and I closed my eyes\
  \ as the car plunged into the puddle. \n\nPanic set in as the wheels span in the\
  \ mud. We tried pushing the car (white sun dress no longer seeming like the best\
  \ outfit choice), creating a walkway using loose fence panels and then simply giving\
  \ up and playing with the dogs, who had chased our car down the track hoping for\
  \ more Pringles. \n\nAs the sun began to lower in the sky, I thought we might actually\
  \ die on a Romanian mountain plateau and, with water and Pringle supplies running\
  \ low, we really needed some help so stood on the path desperately waving our arms\
  \ and hoping that someone would see us. Unable to control my arms and legs at the\
  \ same time, I decided to take inspiration from the car and fell straight into the\
  \ puddle coating my legs and sandals in thick mud.\n\nGiving up, I sulked in the\
  \ car whilst Billy continued to wave his arms until, magically, a woman appeared!\
  \ Carina lived on a farm nearby and had received a call from a friend who had seen\
  \ two people manically waving in the distance. Although Carina spoke no English\
  \ and we spoke no Romanian, we were able to describe our situation through hand\
  \ actions.\n\nAfter a little chuckle, Carina called another friend for help and\
  \ around 20 minutes later our car was being towed out of the mud! I honestly don\u2019\
  t think I will ever feel as relieved as I did in that moment. Our second saviour\
  \ spoke great English and, after yet another chuckle, asked us where we were from\
  \ before telling us that he worked in Wakefield (about a 20 minute drive from our\
  \ hometown of Leeds) as a lorry driver! \n\nSafely out of the mud, we were taken\
  \ by surprise as Carina jumped into our car and directed us through a gap she\u2019\
  d made in the fence and across a field to her house, where we were greeted by her\
  \ son Silvio. Silvio immediately began to wash our car for us whilst Carina invited\
  \ us into her house for a drink and offered me her shower to clean the mud from\
  \ my legs. We sat with her and tried to communicate our gratitude to her through\
  \ the miracle of Google Translate, and she told us that it was her pleasure to have\
  \ been able to help us.\n\nThere are two learnings from this experience, the first\
  \ being not to trust the sat nav, and the second being that people will always come\
  \ together to help strangers out of a difficult situation. I will forever be grateful\
  \ for Carina, Silvio, the lorry driver from Wakefield and the farmer who spotted\
  \ us!"
