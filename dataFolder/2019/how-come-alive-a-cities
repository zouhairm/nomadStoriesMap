Text: "My Paris is the city of cottages and ladies with dogs, Bologna is the capital\
  \ of bicycles and Budapest is the land of fine wines\u2026\nAnd no, I'm not confused.\
  \ Yes, I saw the Eiffel tower, the University of Bologna and the Parliament. But\
  \ my cities never consist only of \u201Cplaces, obligatory to visit\u201D (and,\
  \ sometimes, at all consist of unpopular places, not from guides for tourists).\
  \ Because I believe: a cities \"come alive\" because of a person. And so I strive\
  \ to look at the new city not only with my own eyes, walking alone in search of\
  \ something unusual, striking, memorable, but also necessarily - to explore the\
  \ new place by eyes of a person for whom it\u2019s familiar, daily, but beloved.\
  \ \nWhere to find such a person? \u201CRun\u201D and meet the locals!\nFrom the\
  \ first trip to Europe (it was Italy) I decided for myself: no banal tourist guides\
  \ and \u201Cbeaten paths\u201D! In every city I was planned to visit, I wrote an\
  \ ad on \u201CCouchsurfing\u201D: \n\"Hello! Love your city? Let me see it through\
  \ your eyes! Go for a walk?\u201D\nA lot of people answered me! The young man from\
  \ Rome suggested me to see the \u201CRome on speed\u201D - a motorcycle ride with\
  \ stops at his favorite places. In Florence, with a budding poet, we were looking\
  \ for Dante's places. I explored Bologna riding a restored bicycle from the fifties\
  \ of the last century. The man, who collects and repairs such rarities, opened for\
  \ me \u201Chis Bologna\", showed favorite places, pizzerias and gelaterias. And\
  \ I spent the night with a company that loves folk dancing. I looked at Verona from\
  \ a bird's eye view: we climbed the Verona hills with the amazing woman - a representative\
  \ of the local society for the protection of women's rights - not five minutes!\
  \ In Venice fell in love with the city by myself, but in Milan made up for the lack\
  \ of company ... with a musician who immersed me into the nightlife of \"the kingdom\
  \ of shopping\". \nSuch a successful, multi-faceted journey has made it my rule\
  \ to get acquainted with a new place thanks to the people who are in love with it.\
  \ \nThan, when I traveled in France, I often lived in the suburbs. So my Paris is\
  \ not only a noisy, pompous city, but also a quiet place with a measured life, cottages,\
  \ entwined with ivy, leisurely ladies with dogs and fresh bread in the morning.\n\
  In Warsaw, I immersed myself in military history during the day, and at night I\
  \ danced with the Spaniards living in Poland for several years (with whom I accidentally\
  \ met in a cafe), some Latin dances.\nMy Hungary was full of contrasts. In Budapest,\
  \ I spent time with a local, literally obsessed with the history of wines, and therefore\
  \ learned a lot about the wine history of the region (and, of course, tasted). And\
  \ in Debrecen I changed elite wines for inexpensive beer, as I shared an apartment\
  \ with four students, so every day for me was filled with discos, crazy antics,\
  \ fun, but also falling asleep with books.\nStill were Latvia, Bulgaria, Lithuania,\
  \ etc. No travel without a new meeting, unique history, adventure!\nOf course, my\
  \ family and friends often ask me - \u201CIs it safe at all?!\". And I answer: \u201C\
  it's as safe as living. Somewhere.\" Because the exit from the house is always associated\
  \ with risks, and to live, afraid of the streets and people, just abnormal. I treat\
  \ acquaintances in travel as well as in everyday life: communicate, spend time,\
  \ but always keep at hand phone number of a local police station. As a precaution.\n\
  Fear disappears because of opportunities. I\u2019m happy at the thought that any\
  \ city will never be able to bore me, because each new meeting in it - a fresh look\
  \ at the place that might seem familiar. \nEven better - to conversation with the\
  \ local, with whom you met on a trip, after traveling, friendships and return to\
  \ the city again and create new memories together.\nAnd the best thing in the world:\
  \ when your foreign friend comes to visit your city, and then he looks at it by\
  \ your eyes. And it's a genuine happiness!"
