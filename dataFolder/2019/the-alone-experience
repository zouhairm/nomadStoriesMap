Text: "Alone. As I stepped off the plane in Dublin, Ireland, I found myself completely\
  \ and utterly alone. \n\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong, I had traveled a lot in my\
  \ 21 years of life. Had the pleasure of visiting African nations, many parts of\
  \ Europe, and even Mexico, but I had never traveled there alone. Up to this point,\
  \ I had always traveled with a group or with my family. And there is a certain kind\
  \ of comfort that comes with traveling with others. A sense of security amidst all\
  \ the new sights and people around you. \n\nBut at that moment I found myself, for\
  \ the first time, actually alone. There was no one beside me, no one waiting for\
  \ me, and it was up to me to decide what happened next. \n\nI should mention, that\
  \ I am someone who struggles with anxiety and panic attacks. However, despite this,\
  \ despite the fear that being alone in a new place brings, I wanted to make travel\
  \ a priority in my life. I want to see the world and overcome the fear that held\
  \ my heart.  \n\nMy first day in Dublin began, and I walked confidently through\
  \ the streets, my map haphazardly folded into my back pocket. I was determined to\
  \ not look like a tourist, to not draw any attention to myself, even though my Canadian\
  \ accent clearly gave that away. \n\nWith determination, I explored the streets\
  \ of Dublin. Taking in the captivating cathedrals, the stained glass painting the\
  \ ground in an accidental rainbow. Stepping foot in the Trinity College Library,\
  \ where you could feel the words penetrate your heart. Wandering past Trinity Bar,\
  \ listening as the traditional Irish music spilled out onto the streets. \n\nIn\
  \ traveling on my own, I found a freedom that I had been searching for. I was able\
  \ to explore a city that I had always wanted to visit, at my discretion, my pace.\
  \ And I was able to do so without experiencing the panic that I often felt in my\
  \ life. Peace radiated through my heart as I wandered through the city. But as the\
  \ night began to fall, so did my sense of direction. Suddenly I was lost. The sun\
  \ had left the sky and the people had left the streets, and I found myself alone,\
  \ again, but this time without the confidence and promise of freedom that I had\
  \ experienced stepping off of the plane. \n\nAnxiety began to build within my chest.\
  \ I was lost in a city with no cell service to call with, no one to call, and no\
  \ idea where I was. As worst case scenarios danced in front of my eyes, I panicked,\
  \ sure that I would never be capable of getting myself out of this mess. \n\nWith\
  \ a last ditch attempt, I brought out the map from my back pocket. It was wrinkled\
  \ and dirty, but it was my final option. I reasoned that I needed to find the river,\
  \ If I found the river I would be able to navigate the streets back to my hotel.\
  \ \n\nAfter many wrong turns, backtracking, and retracing my steps, I was able to\
  \ find the river. And never had a body of water been so comforting. The lights from\
  \ the streetlamps reflected off the water, and as I stood in the center of the bridge,\
  \ with faint music dancing over the water, I recognized something within myself.\
  \ I am more capable than I thought myself to be, I am braver and stronger than I\
  \ realized. And although panic and anxiety tried to overwhelm me, I was able to\
  \ navigate a situation I thought I never could. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ this bravery in me. But, at that moment, with no one to turn to, I was able to\
  \ reach inside of myself, and find a strength that I never knew that I had."
