Text: "Growing up without developing a bit of spatial intelligence? I was twenty-one,\
  \ and it was impossible for me to remember routes, street names, or directions,\
  \ even when I had been there many times. It was very frustrating, but above that,\
  \ sad. I researched if this was some kind of disorder, and I found terms such as\
  \ Orientation Disorder/Laterality Disorder. I didn't want to pay much attention;\
  \ I convinced myself that I was not abnormal, but this deficiency became a blow\
  \ to my dignity. For others, this could mean nothing, but for me it meant everything.\
  \ Therefore, I spread my wings to foreign lands. A broken heart needed to be fixed,\
  \ and I think when you need to restore yourself, helping others is the key: volunteering.\
  \ In doing this, I had an indescribable experience with friends from many corners\
  \ of the world. They, with lots of experience, and me, only a rookie trying to prove\
  \ that I could place myself in time and space, and to reach a bit of hope. One of\
  \ these friends asked us to help her to relocate to a new flat. We were done very\
  \ late, and everyone knew how to return to their lodgings, but that day I moved\
  \ to a new hostel in a new area, and I began to wonder how to get there.\n\nI tried\
  \ not to get panic. I had already built personal confidence and I felt that I was\
  \ ready to take unknown paths to anywhere, without crying blood tears. Anyway, once\
  \ I got on the bus, I felt I was in another city; I lost the notion of space and\
  \ with it, my serenity. I really did not know where I was, how long it would take\
  \ to get to my new place, my cell phone had no more battery, and it was 12:30 am.\
  \ Feeling embarrassed, I asked the closest person, if he could guide me with the\
  \ map on his cell phone, and he did. Due to my nervousness, I forgot the name of\
  \ my neighborhood, so it didn't show my route. Frustration increased, and I tried\
  \ to be calm. I finally got off the bus, without having an exact idea where I was\
  \ and the man who was helping me, got off just behind me too. He was very tall,\
  \ with a black coat and a hoarse voice, just like a character in a London novel.\
  \ I was terrified, I was not confident that he would follow me. At that moment,\
  \ I felt that my heart was breaking out of my chest. The street was alone, dark\
  \ and tremendously silent; the moonlight was the only thing that accompanied us,\
  \ it would sound romantic in other circumstances, but not now.\n\nAs I listened\
  \ to the sound of his footsteps and the creaking of autumn leaves, I tried to discern\
  \ what my instinct was revealing to me. Did I truly trust this unknown man? After\
  \ having heard many stories of women lost in the limbo. Was I heading straight into\
  \ the wolf cave? How could I do that? He noticed my face, couldn't help it. My expression\
  \ revealed my fear, and I also started to tremble. \"Are you cold?\" He asked me.\
  \ I couldn't lie, I confessed I was completely afraid, because I didn't know him,\
  \ and I was uncertain if I should let him help me or not. He took off his coat and\
  \ gave it to me because it was actually very cold that night. \"Take my identification.\
  \ I worked in the army\" I took it trying to control my trembling hands. He was\
  \ trying to find out where I lived on his phone, but I couldn't stop thing, what\
  \ if he wasn\u2019t doing that, what if he was planning something else? \"I wish\
  \ my niece had found someone to help her, but that didn\u2019t happen. I am sure\
  \ that you are the niece of someone who awaits you at home\" he finally said.\n\n\
  It had been such a long time since I shed, what I call, tears on the inside. I gave\
  \ him the coat back, and I said to him something that made him cry on the inside,\
  \ too."
