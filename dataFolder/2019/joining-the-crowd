Text: "After a week in Hawaii I had my routine down pat. Every morning I would walk\
  \ to my favourite coffee shop and then walk back along the beach, soaking up the\
  \ lazy sun\u2019s morning rays. \nIt was a good routine. Reliable and calm. A way\
  \ to ground myself for the day. But on the final day, after getting my prized flat\
  \ white, the only one I could find on the island, I saw a crowd beginning to gather\
  \ right before I would turn off towards the beach. People were holding signs I couldn\u2019\
  t quite make out, and roads were being blocked off. It looked like the Christmas\
  \ pageants from back home, and filled with a childish optimism despite the fact\
  \ it was August, I changed paths and joined the crowd. \nAs I stood shoulder to\
  \ shoulder with the boisterous Americans I tried to listen into conversations, to\
  \ gain a glimpse of insight into why we were all gathered in the middle of the street.\
  \ \n\u201CHe\u2019s speaking up for us\u201D\n\u201CHe\u2019s a racist\u201D\n\u201C\
  He\u2019s looking out for the little guy\u201D\n\u201CNo, he\u2019s only looking\
  \ out for himself and his friends\u201D\nI looked up and saw a man in a suit standing\
  \ in a window. Another glance around revealed them to be placed at strategic vantage\
  \ points around the street. We were surrounded. Something big must be happening.\
  \ \nI\u2019d never seen anything like it, I tried to catch the eye of one of the\
  \ suited men. I managed and waved like an idiot until I got a smile back. A weird\
  \ feeling of success came over me, as I was acknowledged by one of the important\
  \ people.  \n\u201CHe\u2019s doing great things for America, we\u2019re lucky he\u2019\
  s giving up his time to be President\u201D. President. That\u2019s who we\u2019\
  re waiting for. Suddenly I was hit with memories of seeing my Prime Minister back\
  \ home jogging laps along the bank unaccompanied but for the running river. No pomp.\
  \ No circumstance. Definitely no crowds holding signs and discussing the merits\
  \ of the politician. \nMore of the road was blocked off and the crowds were shuffled\
  \ sideways. Every person, no matter their political persuasion was moved 50 metres\
  \ down the road. And side by side they stood again, respectfully discussing the\
  \ President. The good and the bad. Just standing together in the street in the middle\
  \ of the day, waiting for a glimpse of the man they either loved or loathed. For\
  \ what could possibly have been the first time, one common goal. And I was part\
  \ of it. \nThe men in suits began to move. A man and a woman were coming out of\
  \ the hotel, but they were blocked from sight. Quickly they got into two separate\
  \ black cars and began driving down the street. A roar rose up from the crowd, so\
  \ loud the cheers and boos were indistinguishable amongst the cacophony. \nAs the\
  \ black cars drove past, through the tinted windows I caught a glimpse of a man\
  \ waving happily, seemingly oblivious to the mixed crowd surrounding me. \nBut as\
  \ soon as he came, he was gone. The crowd, who had stood for hours shoulder to shoulder,\
  \ having in depth political discussions with strangers, dispersed to go back to\
  \ their lives. Their chance encounters all but forgotten, overshadowed by their\
  \ moment with The Donald. \nMy coffee long since gone, I meandered back to the beach,\
  \ to finish my walk and try to make sense of the President I never expected to find\
  \ on my morning coffee run."
