Text: "\u201CHasta Que Se Seque el Malec\xF3n,\u201D sings Jacob Forever a Reggaeton\
  \ artist. My Cuban friend and I are blasting the song in the car while driving to\
  \ Miami International Airport. My friend says \u201CPapito, my uncle, will be waiting\
  \ for you, don\u2019t worry, you will recognize him!\u201D\nAfter just about one\
  \ hour above the clouds, I\u2019m warmly welcomed with a kiss on the cheek by Papito.\
  \ Bienvenido a Cuba TH! This is my nickname since my name Theresa is commonly spelled\
  \ without the H in Spanish. With my overflowing luggage filled with clothing, basic\
  \ necessities like soap, toothpaste, coffee and medicine imported from Miami, I\
  \ finally had arrived in the tropical paradise. In a cute, old car giving off clouds\
  \ of smoke we drive home on a bouncy ride. I will be staying at Abuela Diana\u2019\
  s house in El Vedado, a barrio outside of La Habana Vieja. Abuela is my adopted\
  \ Cuban grandma and reminds me of my own in every way.\nAlmost arriving Papito explains:\
  \ \u201CThis is Avenida de los Presidentes, over there L\xEDnea and here is Maternidad\
  \ de L\xEDnea. Across the street, the red building is Presidente Hotel and right\
  \ behind it El Malec\xF3n. Remember TH, you live on Calle 9 between H and I.\u201D\
  \ Dios m\xEDo! For a person like me who is not blessed with strong orientation skills\
  \ Papito\u2019s directions were quite overwhelming.\nWhenever I strolled through\
  \ La Habana Vieja, walking the narrow streets, visiting local markets with a variety\
  \ of fresh fruits and raw meat that was displayed in the bare heat with flies all\
  \ over, the landmarks I memorized for orientation were El Capitolio and El Malec\xF3\
  n. That\u2019s how I found my way home without Google maps. Internet connection\
  \ is not an option, unless you buy an Internet card that can be used only at certain\
  \ Wi-Fi spots by parks or hotels. I passed barrios with plenty panader\xEDas where\
  \ my favorite pan redondo and pastelitos with cream cheese and guava were sold.\
  \ Sometimes I stopped at local caf\xE9s for a cortadito, colada or Malta. Childhood\
  \ memories made me recall the Cuban bizcochos cubiertos de chocolate, called Africana.\
  \ This Cuban sweet has orange packaging with two palm trees and a tribal looking\
  \ African girl on it. I was so lucky to find a box of Africana in a random street\
  \ side kiosk, because often stores are relatively empty and a lot of products are\
  \ sold out. So when I saw the box I bought it. I knew how to use the Cuban currencies\
  \ like a local, where 25 Cuban Peso Nacional (CUP) are equal to $1USD and 1 Cuban\
  \ Convertible Peso (CUC) equals $1USD. This was very useful in order for me to pass\
  \ as Cubana and not as a tourist. \nThe barrios in La Habana Vieja are alive. Motorcycles\
  \ are passing by honking, children playing in the streets, some typical Chevrolet\
  \ Bel Air, Ford Fairlane and Ford Falcon are driving by in all colors whirling up\
  \ the dust, roosters and dogs are roaming around, Salsa music is playing, Cuban\
  \ grandmas are smoking cigars on the front door step and laundry is dangling between\
  \ the streets to dry.\nWhen I arrive home, Abuela usually waits for me behind her\
  \ fence talking to our neighbor Eldia or sits in her rocking chair hiding from humidity\
  \ in the cool, dark house. Abuela\u2019s street is a row of Spanish colonial style\
  \ houses and faceless concrete blocks all mixed. Eldia\u2019s house is decorated\
  \ with paintings of Yemaya, Oshun and Chango from Santeria, the Afro-Caribbean religion\
  \ popular in Cuba. In the afternoon, I picked up Patricia and David, the two little\
  \ cousins, from school with Abuela and we went to Papito\u2019s house. His wife\
  \ is an incredible cook. She made delicious Tostones, Moros y Cristianos, Ropa Vieja\
  \ and Maduros. Later, I walked El Malec\xF3n to watch the sunset. Young people and\
  \ lovers were sitting along the seawall. From afar I saw La Habana Vieja and El\
  \ Morro as the sun was setting over the ocean.\nAlthough life in Cuba is not easy,\
  \ the island\u2019s flamboyant colors, dramatic scenery, lively people and contagious\
  \ warmth make the country breathtakingly beautiful. I love my Cuban family and will\
  \ always be TH for them."
