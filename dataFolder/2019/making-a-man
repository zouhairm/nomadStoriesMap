Text: "A Xhosa family\u2019s celebration of their son\u2019s passage into manhood\
  \ weaves threads of tradition, wisdom and love into one remarkable tapestry of identity.\n\
  \nIn the dimness of his simple shelter, 18-year-old Manelisi Ndzewuza burns like\
  \ a snapshot of the struggle for identity in South Africa\u2019s complex society.\
  \ Painted head-to-toe in ochre-red clay and wrapped only in a blanket, he busily\
  \ scrolls on his gold smartphone. \n\nI have been looking forward to attending my\
  \ first traditional Xhosa welcome home ceremony (Mgidi) all week. Having recently\
  \ been confronted by my own mortality, my personal struggle with identity has come\
  \ crashing to the fore and I am eager to explore what insights time-honoured traditions\
  \ can provide. \n\nWith Nomsa Nzeuza, Manelisi\u2019s aunt, chatting away in my\
  \ passenger seat, we begin the climb up the steep and dusty hills that cut into\
  \ the parched Winterhoek Mountains of the Eastern Cape. Admiring her incandescent\
  \ gold and turquoise headdress, I listen avidly to her explanation of the customs\
  \ I need to adhere to. \u201CRemember\u201D, she says, \u201Canything that the family\
  \ offers you, you MUST accept\u201D.\n\nIt\u2019s 11 am. Though the thermometer\
  \ is peaking at 35\xB0C, it feels closer to 45\xB0C. As we pull up the narrow street\
  \ outside Manelisi\u2019s family home, around 50 men have already gathered around\
  \ the symbolic kraal in the front yard. Enormous cast-iron pots of beef stewing\
  \ on white-hot embers cast off waves of heat intensified by a searing summer wind\
  \ swirling up thick columns of dust.\n\nOver 200 of Manelisi\u2019s family, friends\
  \ and community will congregate here today to welcome him as a man after his inxeba.\
  \ A sacrosanct and guarded rite of passage deeply woven into Xhosa identity, in\
  \ which initiates spend three weeks isolated in the mountains undergoing ritualized\
  \ circumcision and ceremonial tasks. Nelson Mandela described it as:\n\n\u201Cthe\
  \ essential step in the life of every Xhosa man... a kind of spiritual preparation\
  \ for the trials of manhood.\u201D\n\nI enter a specially erected wooden structure\
  \ in the corner of the yard, where Manelisi remains secluded. \u201CI can\u2019\
  t go with you\u201D, explains Nomsa, \u201Cbecause only men and single young women\
  \ are allowed\u201D. \n\nI greet Manelisi, whose eyes hang heavy with exhaustion.\
  \ He hasn\u2019t slept for over 24 hours, yet he needs to stay alert. Several elders\
  \ from his Oomdange Mlawo Botomane clan have come to commemorate his transition\
  \ and he needs to listen attentively to their advice on how to \u2018be a man\u2019\
  .\n\nOn crates around him, young men dressed in fashionably bright football jerseys\
  \ laugh and chat animatedly. Their conversation breaks off when an imposing shadow\
  \ appears in the doorway. Joseph Nzeuza, \u2018Joe\u2019, is Manelisi\u2019s uncle\
  \ and a clan elder. His hand-knitted maroon and white patterned hat adds to his\
  \ height and palpable presence. As he manoeuvres his powerful frame into the room,\
  \ there\u2019s a deafening silence. \n\nIn the local isiXhosa language, Joe imparts\
  \ potent and stoic lessons aimed at showing his young nephew his place in the world,\
  \ while also teaching him the valued principles, passed down to him, on what it\
  \ means to \u2018be a man\u2019. His measured words are met with murmurs of agreement,\
  \ as the crowd absorbs a lifetime of experience.\n\nJoe rejoins the male elders,\
  \ so I seek out Nomsa in the tightly packed lounge. As more and more guests arrive,\
  \ women scramble to find an inch of floor and a blanket to sit on. The humidity\
  \ rises to eclipse the intensity of conversation and laughter as family and friends\
  \ gather in interlacing circles, catching up on the latest happenings and enjoying\
  \ a hearty home-cooked feast. \n\nOnly Manelisi isn\u2019t present. He remains isolated,\
  \ listening to the voices celebrating his coming of age. Tomorrow he will wash and\
  \ don a new cloak of responsibility and identity. Reflecting on his own Mgidi, Nelson\
  \ Mandela aptly said:\n\n\u201CLooking back, I know I was not a man that day and\
  \ would not become one for many years.\u201D\n\nThough Manelisi faces a similar\
  \ journey of discovery, today\u2019s festivities capture the unwavering love and\
  \ support, traditional wisdom and heritage that his family will provide. A steadfast\
  \ guiding thread from which he can draw, as he weaves his own unique tapestry as\
  \ a Xhosa man."
