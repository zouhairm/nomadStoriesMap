Text: "In its lower reaches the Zambezi River looks gentle and dreamy but I am no\
  \ longer fooled. This liquid no-man\u2019s land between Zambia and Zimbabwe slides\
  \ in convoluted currents over hidden sandbanks and whirls around the spiky branches\
  \ of uprooted trees.   Submerged hippos loiter in the deeper channels watching our\
  \ approaching canoes with their periscope eyes like a malevolent surveillance squad.\
  \ \n\nLast night I heard a lion growling outside my tent. \n\n\u2018Lions don\u2019\
  t like swimming,\u2019 TK said, \u2018That\u2019s why we\u2019re camping on islands.\n\
  \n\u2018Don\u2019t like,\u2019 I noted, \u2018not \u2018don\u2019t\u2019.\u2019\
  \  \n\nHe laughed. \n\nIt\u2019s my third day on the river and I am on high alert.\
  \   I see a cluster of hippo eyes to our left.  One hippo moves closer to us and\
  \ lifts his head above the water.  He is the leader.  I hear Hakrim\u2019s breath\
  \ quicken behind me.   If that hippo forces water up from his nostrils he is warning\
  \ us.  If he opens his mouth wide to the sky, he is coming for us.  I push my paddle\
  \ deeper into the water as Hakrim steers us to the right.   \n\nTK calls to us in\
  \ a low voice, delivering instructions.\n\n\u2018Come behind me. Quickly, don\u2019\
  t splash your paddles.  Stay away from the bank. You will get stuck under trees.\
  \  If you get stuck stay in the canoe and I will come to you.\u2019\n\nI know why\
  \ he wants us to stay in the canoe.  A short distance behind us we saw a crocodile\
  \ slip into the river from the bank.  I make a silent plea to the hippo with each\
  \ sweep of my paddle, please don't, please don't, please don't. Slowly we move through\
  \ and out of the danger zone.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.   \n\nWe fan out\
  \ once more as we round a wide-arched bend and the view to our right opens out into\
  \ a sweep of unspoilt land stretching upwards and outwards from the bank. Away from\
  \ the river, the dry season has yellowed the grass, and large earthy patches stretch\
  \ between the curiously flat-topped trees. The ubiquitous scrub bushes, equipped\
  \ with merciless thorns, hog any shade.   Here and there is bare rock, a boulder\
  \ from some historic land movement, now washed clean of soil and randomly positioned\
  \ far from its source.  There are no flowers, no colours other than the yellows,\
  \ greens and browns of leaves and earth, except for us.  \n\nTK stands up in his\
  \ canoe so we can all see him.  He\u2019s pointing to a grassy plateau, three hundred\
  \ metres from the bank.  A frisson of excitement ripples through the line of canoes\
  \ \n\nWe bunch up around him in a hushed scramble for cameras and binoculars.  There\u2019\
  s some kind of commotion up there, an unruly mass of darkest grey is pulsing outward\
  \ and inward on the plateau like a huge ragged heart.  It takes a moment to fully\
  \ see it for what it is.  Vultures.   \n\nThe hippos and crocodiles are forgotten.\
  \  We land our canoes on an earthy stretch of the bank, pulling them up behind us.\
  \   TK signals to follow him in single file.  We scramble up the series of terraced\
  \ banks, bending double as though dodging enemy fire,.  As we come closer to the\
  \ heaving mass, a few vultures move away to hunch up on one of the scattered boulders\
  \ nearby, eying our approach. They are bigger and more ominous than I imagined.\
  \  When we are within 50 metres they lift, as one, from their scavenging and fly\
  \ in ascending circles into the sky.  \n\nAn adult bull elephant corpse is lying\
  \ in the grass. TK circles the body and points to a large round wound in its flank.\
  \   \n\n\u2018Poachers,\u2019 he says.  I immediately turn towards the elephant\u2019\
  s head, but his tusks are still there.  \u2018He has managed to cross the river,\
  \ after they shot him.  They could not follow without a boat.\u2019\n\nI feel a\
  \ small cheer of victory.  It is immediately overwhelmed by sadness.   \n\nI look\
  \ around and see my fellow paddlers surrounding the dead elephant, their faces a\
  \ mixture of excitement and awe, their cameras whirring.  \n\nI withdraw to lean\
  \ against one of the rocks.  I smell the blood from the corpse.  I tense.  I look\
  \ inland, watching for movement."
