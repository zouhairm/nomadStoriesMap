Text: A love story. A boy and a boy. They did not choose to find each other, anyway,
  destiny play with them. Now, they have passed through the years and they have found
  troubles, they need to solve them to save their relationship. Anyway, they can't.
  So the great love story, will end. During the story, there are in a museum. Alone.
  The most famous one. They are fighting all the time. At the begging, they are quite.
  At the end, they are quite. But at the "during", they are fighting, and they are
  screaming, and she is loving him, but at the same time hating him, and he is doing
  the same thing. During some minutes, he is speechless and she is going to say everything
  to him. Everything. How he ruined him. On contrast, he is not doing the same thing,
  he has nothing more to say. During one little piece of the work, they are going
  to kiss each other, and may lay down, talking about the greatest trip of their lifes.
  Moving us into flashbacks, saying things like "And when you buy that cat, when we
  got lost on the biggest market of the town, and you bought thousand plants... I
  just could think 'I fucking love him'... But I just don't anymore. You have stole
  everything".
