Text: "A few years ago, I had the experience to visit Argentina, specifically Bariloche.\
  \ My Family and I traveled mid-September, whose weather is still cold even if it\
  \ is the end of winter. However, the spring had already started to show some of\
  \ its glamor.\nIt is a wonderful destiny for every kind of groups: Family, friends\
  \ and even going solo. Especially with all the activities that the city has to offer.\
  \ As we went to our travel on winter, there was still a little bit of snow, therefore\
  \ we could enjoy all the great activities that involved the white landscape.\nAs\
  \ we arrived in Bariloche, we checked-in the hotel, which had this beautiful view\
  \ of a lake and trees and great restaurants. Then we went to \u201CCalle Mitre\u201D\
  , whose there was a statue of Julio Roca, ex-president of Argentina, and, in the\
  \ same exact day, there was a parade with a band and fanfare what made the atmosphere\
  \ energetic. We enjoyed with plenty of chocolate that we bought from local stores.\
  \ We spent many \"pesos\" on it. One of the best investments that we did!\nI live\
  \ in Brazil, so I have never seen snow. You can imagine myself in \u201CCerro Campanario\u201D\
  , 7049m hill on the shores of Lake Nahuel Huapi, all ice and cold. I could not help\
  \ to fall in love with the place and freaking out about it.\nIt was an iced and\
  \ cold view. The snow was covering the huge mountain trees and its leaves, which\
  \ began to show up again. While we were climbing on the cable car, I did not expect\
  \ to find my passion: travelling! Travelling is the best answer and medicine to\
  \ anything! \nKeeping that thought, we reached to the top and the view of it was\
  \ outstanding. Through the observatory, we could see almost 360\xBA of stunning\
  \ landscapes. It was on the middle of the mountains and we could see the lake too.\
  \ The place gave to us several beautiful photos, enough to expose beautifully in\
  \ our living room.  \nOn the next day, we did a tour in \u201CFrozen Lagoon\u201D\
  . It is located in \u201CValle Del Chalhuaco\u201D, a valley where is colder than\
  \ the usual and the snow remains a little longer than other mountains in Bariloche,\
  \ especially in the lagoon. In this outing, a guide escorted us and other groups\
  \ towards the snowy mountains. He told us about a frog that lives in the lagoon\
  \ and it gets frozen but alive during the winter. Later, we went for a meal in a\
  \ cabin, it was a delicious local meat with wine and juice. After the tour, we did\
  \ skiing, but not in the regular way. We used paddles to slide on the snow with\
  \ our butts. It is the coolest way to ski, in my opinion.\nThrew many places we\
  \ went to, nothing compares to a little city that we happened to visit. It is a\
  \ sweet city and it seems like we were living in a way back in the past because\
  \ of its vintage looks. The name of it is \u201CVilla la Angostura\u201D. It is\
  \ a very friendly village nearby Bariloche. We walked on a store that had leprechauns\
  \ made of wood, which the sales woman said that it is common in their culture. Each\
  \ one has a special meaning, for instance my dad bought one that has a key in its\
  \ hand, which it means that the leprechaun is a house protector. \nIt was a great\
  \ trip and we had an amazing time. We could really enjoy the places that we have\
  \ been, even the signs during the road were a motive to my sister and I stop and\
  \ take pictures. I was not expecting a lot from this trip, however I was wonderfully\
  \ surprised. The whole family was able to bond with part of Argentina and we could\
  \ learn a lot about its culture. Do you that every single person in Bariloche greet\
  \ each other with two kisses on each side of their cheeks?"
