Text: "Rejection is nothing new for me.  I am familiar with everything from picked\
  \ last in gym class as a kid to romantic denials as an adult\u2026but this was the\
  \ first time a stranger, unsolicited, has rejected me.\n\nThe intent of selecting\
  \ the drive between Kruger National Park and Johannesburg was to enjoy the striking\
  \ scenery, and while I did, it was the conservation with my driver will stay with\
  \ me.  Thabo, a member of the Zulu tribe eyed me cautiously for the first half of\
  \ the windy drive, no doubt concerned for his upholstery given my greenish hue.\
  \  After the road straightened and I resumed a normal shade, we started with the\
  \ chit chat expected from two strangers trapped in a car.  While the weather and\
  \ traffic talk wasn\u2019t titillating, it allowed us to establish a rapport.  \n\
  \nIn my mind the word \u201CZulu\u201D is always followed by \u201Cwarrior\u201D\
  , sort of a contrast to the man next to me sipping a Pepsi and checking him messages\
  \ on a BlackBerry.  To determine just how far off base my stereotypes of the Zulu\
  \ people were, I used this new bond to investigate.  \n\n\u201CWhere do you live\u201D\
  ?  \n\nThabo explained that he has two homes to meld tradition with the realities\
  \ of modern; an apartment in Johannesburg and a traditional home in the South Eastern\
  \ area of the country.  Obviously the term \u2018traditional home\u2019 required\
  \ some follow up.\n\nIs your traditional home actually a hut complete with a thatched\
  \ roof?  \u201COf course\u201D  \n\nDo you have a spear and shield in the hut? \
  \ \u201COf course\u201D \n\nDo you hunt and eat bush meat? \u201COf course\u201D\
  \n\nDo you wear animal skins when you are there? \u201COf course\u201D  \n\nThe\
  \ look of sheer fascination on my face greatly amused him.  Maybe all those photos\
  \ I had seen in a National Geographic weren\u2019t so far off after all.  For a\
  \ while Thabo attempted to teach me some basic Xhosa, his native clicking language\
  \ before giving up in frustration at my complete ineptitude.  \n\nWe chatted for\
  \ a bit about his life in Johannesburg where his wife worked as a nurse and he did\
  \ contract work for tour companies.  We shared similar struggles of cell phone coverage,\
  \ dreaded trips to the grocery store and wasted hours sitting in traffic.  I found\
  \ the juxtaposition so odd and he found my disbelief entertaining.    \u201CSometimes\
  \ you hunt African wildlife and prepare it outside your hut, and sometimes you play\
  \ Angry Birds on your iPad.\u201D  He just grinned and nodded.   \n\nThe talk then\
  \ transitioned to the current President\u2019s polygamist lifestyle. Thabo believes\
  \ that President Zuma\u2019s 6 marriages were excessive, especially at the going\
  \ rate of 10 cows per wife.  His reluctance was easy to comprehend after he explained\
  \ that he still owed his father-in-law 6 cows; five cows for the initial cost and\
  \ one additional cow that he was fined due to a pregnancy out of wedlock.  \n\n\
  In his village, he stated that 7 was the \u2018ideal\u2019 number of wives.  Naturally\
  \ this led to me enquire about his intent to take a second wife.  Given his position\
  \ in life and his outstanding bovine debt, Thabo didn\u2019t envision another spouse\
  \ in his future.  He did clarify that if he this ever became a reality for him,\
  \ he did not consider me an option.  My mind started to flip through our recent\
  \ conversation, searching for the moment where I offered myself as a possibility.\
  \ \n \nOblivious to my confusion, he continued to offer his unsolicited views on\
  \ the subject of \u2018me as a poor wife option\u2019.  \u201CYou talk too much.\
  \  I can see that you have shorts on under your skirt.  I don\u2019t think you would\
  \ be willing to serve my mother food on your knees.  I can tell that you are very\
  \ educated.  And you have very pale skin, which always means extra cows.\u201D \
  \ Suddenly the \u201Cit\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u201D line seemed like a welcome\
  \ explanation.  \n\nFor many years, family and friends have asked the dreaded line\u2026\
  \u201Cwhy are you still single?\u201D  Now, thanks to Thabo, the part-time Zulu\
  \ Warrior, I have an answer."
