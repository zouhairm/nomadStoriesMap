Text: "\"Voy a reir, voy a bailar\" (I'm going to laugh, I'm going to dance). It is\
  \ these words, sung by Marc Anthony, that carried my friend and I on our trip to\
  \ Latin America. We have built our friendship on the salsa dancefloor, and together\
  \ we became addicted to moving and spinning to the uplifting rhythm of the trumpets\
  \ and drums. So much so that, two years later, to celebrate the end of our university\
  \ degree, it seemed natural to travel to the country where our favorite party never\
  \ ended: Cuba. It seemed like a crazy idea at first, most of all to our parents!\
  \ Two 21 year-old ladies who gladly accept an invitation to a dance, in a developing\
  \ country. Yet, after a couple of months of back-and-forth decisions and the longest\
  \ flights of my life, we landed in Havana, ready for a trip that will last 2 months.\
  \ \nWe were rather exhausted as we took our first steps in this country, having\
  \ little idea where we were going to spend the night. Immediately, a first problem\
  \ arose: the ATMs did not accept our cash passports. The only way we could get money\
  \ was by changing our US dollars to one of the two available currencies, the CUP\
  \ (national currency) or the CUC (convertible peso, more expensive). We crossed\
  \ our fingers that cash would last enough for a few days. A taxi took us to a 'casa\
  \ particular', the Cuban equivalent of bed and breakfast. You cannot book these\
  \ online, but they are indicated on the street by a symbol in the shape of a capital\
  \ I. The house was small with modest furnishing and bars on the windows, but we\
  \ could see every effort was made to welcome the guest. Our host was an elderly,\
  \ well groomed man, eager to plan our entire stay in Havana with all his best recommendations.\
  \ His best piece of advice might have been to never say that it was our first time\
  \ in Cuba, as this is a cue for locals to scam us.\nAfter a good night sleep, we\
  \ headed out for our first day in the Cuban capital. Our day was wide open, since\
  \ we had nothing booked and not even a map to guide us. A run-down, packed bus took\
  \ us to the centre. We stayed close together, watching each other's pockets for\
  \ unwelcome hands. At first, I felt like we stepped right into a postcard of a Havana\
  \ that has remained in a Castro era: rows of old Sedans of every colour, parked\
  \ or driving alongside tuktuks and horse-drawn carriages. Groups of men sitting\
  \ on terraces, under lines of drying clothes and hanging electrical cables, smoking\
  \ cigars. On this first day, we noticed that most Cubans were at first hostile towards\
  \ us as they thought we were American, but completely opened up when we said we\
  \ were Australian. However, our fair skin and backpacks got us a lot of whistling\
  \ all day long (as a joke we decided to reply that \"we are from China\" to cut\
  \ their flirting short), and by the end of the day we have received tens of marriage\
  \ proposals, of people who genuinely want to leave the country. A friendly-looking\
  \ Cuban couple came to us and started offering advice, pointing places they recommended\
  \ we should visit. This little tour ended in the most expensive cafe in town, where\
  \ they were obviously expecting us to treat them gratefully for their service. This\
  \ was a type of scam we had not experienced beforehand. Fortunately, my friend's\
  \ Spanish got us out of this situation. What a day of culture shock we've had!\n\
  Our bright highlight of Cuba was Trinidad, a small village where the locals would\
  \ all gather on the piazza at night, eating dinner on the terrace. A band played\
  \ salsa music, and everyone danced in the middle of the night, young and old, tourists\
  \ and locals, on the cobbled stones. On our last night, we ended the night in a\
  \ cave night club."
