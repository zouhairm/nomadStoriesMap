Text: "As a born and raised Brazilian, I believe that the best trips must include\
  \ a natural-off-the-road spot, preferably a beach. That is why I\u2019ve always\
  \ been adventurous when it comes to visit new coastal sunny places \u2013 and that\
  \ isn\u2019t difficult living in Brazil.\nI was born in a tiny city in the middle\
  \ of three southeastern states: Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo and Bahia \u2013 that\
  \ means that I have the best of two worlds: I live near the mountains and close\
  \ to beautiful beaches.\nRecently, my boyfriend and I decided to go on a little\
  \ weekend trip to a picturesque villa right on the border of Espirito Santo and\
  \ Bahia: Costa Dourada (or Golden Coast).  \nSomehow, I managed to have a discount\
  \ code at Booking.com and I managed to pay almost nothing at a local inn. The place\
  \ is so deserted that you only have small inns (maybe two or three) and a still\
  \ building small hotel (at that time). I made the reservation, put an extra bikini\
  \ on my bag, bought a wine and a vodka (I was planning on a romance weekend, remember?)\
  \ and made notes on my IPhone about the road.\nCosta Dourada is not far at all,\
  \ but the road is tricky, after all people never heard of this place. Moreover,\
  \ we did not have any internet connection from 150 km into our road. Therefore,\
  \ I had to trust my feelings and my boyfriend\u2019s sense of direction (which I\
  \ don\u2019t trust anymore).\nSo our adventure began. We drove for about 3 hours\
  \ listening to nice Brazilian music and chatting happily about life. Before entering\
  \ the off-road part of our trip (about 20 km of non-pavement road), we stopped to\
  \ ask for directions and to buy some coconut water (which not far from there we\
  \ zipped a little bit of vodka inside \u2013 a bit irresponsible, I know, but we\
  \ were young then). A nice man said that we should keep driving straight ahead until\
  \ a long line of eucalyptus trees \u2013 there we should take the left and not long\
  \ after that, we would see signs indicating the beach. Easy breezy, he said.\nThat\
  \ was not what happened. Somehow, we missed the left entrance and we drove around\
  \ for 60 km, lost in the middle of literary nowhere. Right after I realized we were\
  \ lost, I tried to keep calm and made a little prayer thanking Jesus (I\u2019m not\
  \ even religious, so I don\u2019t know if He heard me) for not having any wild animals\
  \ in Brazil (at least not the dangerous ones). After being lost for about 2 hours\
  \ we finally saw a little villa where a gentle man driving a truck explained where\
  \ we went wrong and how we could get to Costa Dourada. I\u2019m not sure but in\
  \ my mind, after this man explained once again the path we should follow, it seemed\
  \ a blink of an eye and we were standing in front of our little inn. \nThe inn was\
  \ quite peculiar. A four-story building in the middle of rocky golden cliffs nearby\
  \ a green-ish sea. Laura, the owner, invited us in. We were the only guests. She\
  \ told us that tourists are still discovering the place and she is getting ready\
  \ for a future when Costa Dourada is filled with people from all over. Laura lives\
  \ with her brother (the owner of the only bar in the villa) and her mom (Tia Fina,\
  \ a lovely seventy-year-old lady who just had to cook us dinner at seven pm \u2013\
  \ an unusual time for Brazilians). At night, we didn\u2019t have much to do, so\
  \ we slept excessively early with no TV on or cellphones.\nI woke up with the first\
  \ ray of light. The view from our window was breathtaking. Laura served a simple\
  \ but nice breakfast and we went to the beach probably around eight or nine in the\
  \ morning. \nWe were the only two people. We had this mile long gold sand beach\
  \ to ourselves. And silence. We could only hear the waves and our smiley faces.\
  \ It was all worth it. There it was: the beautiful unknown Golden coast. Unfortunately,\
  \ it was easier to find our way back home."
