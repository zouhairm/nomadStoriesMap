Text: "\"Manali - An Intimacy with the Monochrome Mountains\"\n\nThe long wait faced\
  \ a climax alas. Suitcases all packed fro a 7-day tour could make even a man look\
  \ womanly to the outsiders. \u201CLook at him ! What does he carry in those ?\u201D\
  \nClothes, shoes, accessories, books that I couldn\u2019t find time to read, my\
  \ journal, scribble pad and headphones most importantly, do take a massive trolley,\
  \ one med-sized travel bag and a backpack. Not to forget my guitar. That must\u2019\
  ve taken serious effort to walk around with. Not giving up ! No compromise on anything\
  \ that\u2019s been thrown in. Just before I was locking my room shut, it hit me\
  \ \u201CToothbrush !\u201D. Ran in to grab that. NOW, I was ready .\n\nBeing a class\
  \ trip, the bunch of us 40, together we left to the train station. With two friends,\
  \ I ran to find our coach, only to find that our train was delayed. \u201CAt the\
  \ least, it hasn\u2019t been called off\u201D, we told to each other with a quiet\
  \ laugh. A loud scream from my friends put the train\u2019s whistle to shame.\n\n\
  After a 1 day & 2 nights travel, we reached New Delhi an hour past sunrise. A chilly\
  \ when we South Indians had to get the sweaters out. \nFrom Delhi, it was a long\
  \ trip again but by bus. Stops to fill fuel were times to release the tension in\
  \ our bladders. After the proven long ride, Manali welcomed us with its ice cold\
  \ rains.\n\nI couldn\u2019t wait no more to set foot on the pristine snow. The roads\
  \ to the mountains were adorned all over by snow, and the air all misty. The well\
  \ experienced drivers drove us all safe. Still in a shock to accept what my eyes\
  \ were looking at, we got closer, and closer. And there ! Manali\u2019s enchanting\
  \ mountains. Could I ask for anything better ? I suggested me and friends to take\
  \ a leak. Our warm piss cut through the snow like laser on diamonds. Several grossed\
  \ out faces noticed the process and soon wanted to try the same.\n\nWearing the\
  \ warm furry coats and the boots, off we walked. First step on the dense ice that\
  \ covered the mountains like it was a huge bowl of vanilla ice-cream over a heap\
  \ of brownies, saved for a giant. I was wondering how the creator had come up with\
  \ this masterpiece. Such was the scene. True bliss, anyone would frame. In no time,\
  \ tight snow balls flew to their aims. It was delightful. I began walking alone\
  \ to enjoy the beauty in silence, trying my best to simmer down all the noises and\
  \ take in only the sound of cold winds that kissed the uncovered portions of my\
  \ skin, and the footsteps. There was a snowfall immediately like the snow there\
  \ wasn\u2019t enough. With my hands spread wide apart, pretending to be an Indian\
  \ actor from the movies, I fell on my knees, lied against by back and drew a snow\
  \ angel that I had always wanted to. An inflated tire allowed us to slide from a\
  \ chosen high spot. There was skiing too. \"Never expect too much is a saying\"\
  \ proved itself  once again as we were allowed only to ski on a flat surface. I\
  \ hardly took my phone out. One, I involved myself entirely in taking in the nature.\
  \ The other reason being my super wet gloves. I fixated on one song. \u201CPudhu\
  \ Vellai Mazhai\u201D from the film \u201CRoja\u201D, and kept that playing in my\
  \ head on a loop. So perfect. My hands dug into the snow, and the feel of it along\
  \ with the heavy snowfall led to a dreamy intimacy. Upon having spent almost two\
  \ whole hours, I did not want to leave. Two hours is hardly enough I thought. Sticking\
  \ to time is top priority when in groups. I embraced myself to walk away from them\
  \ beauties. Kept turning back until the point when the mountains disappeared from\
  \ my sight.\n\n\u201CBody frozen.\n Feet numb.\n Gloves wet.\n Amidst the fairy\
  \ dust raining over us from above,\n it was a fight against the temperature going\
  \ negative\n but we surrendered to its beauty.\n And it was worth it. \u201C"
