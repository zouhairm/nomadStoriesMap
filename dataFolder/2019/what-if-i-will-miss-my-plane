Text: "22 of October, 2018\nBerlin\n\nThat was the last day of my stay in this \u2018\
  poor but sexy\u2019 place. I came on student festival for 5 days and had decided\
  \ to organize a small trip to Paris and Barcelona after, since my holidays were\
  \ about to start.\nI took my camera with me but I actually didn\u2019t shoot anything.\
  \ You know it happens in trips, especially, if in your head it is supposed that\
  \ you are kind of creative and you take some time to make something original and\
  \ authentic? So, I didn\u2019t touch the camera for almost a week. But then after\
  \ our first and last festival parties, casual workdays and day fully spent with\
  \ my newfound (upd: seems, already lost) soulmate - a german guy who thinks he could\
  \ fit perfectly in 1920s. What can I say now? We had fun. The next day I woke up\
  \ totally in Berlin\u2019s vibe: Berliner Kindl on the table despite that I don\u2019\
  t actually drink beer. Except cider. Oh, that\u2019s my favourite in Germany. In\
  \ each company, in each bar and each Sp\xE4tkauf I am that person eagerly seeking\
  \ for not bitter beer, but fruit one or cider. That time I found out a tequila beer\
  \ that I could stand and its taste for me now is strongly connected with Berlin.\n\
  What else is connected? The fact that I\u2019m always tipsy and tired because I\
  \ neglect sleep for the sake of funny stories. For example, one of how we went in\
  \ a bar, found nails polishes there and started to colour each others nails. \n\
  So yes, let\u2019s come back to that october morning. I had a short plan for the\
  \ day: I wanted to check how Teufelsberg looks like and I needed to go to the airport\
  \ in the evening because I had a flight to Paris in the evening. I was extremely\
  \ inspired and opened for each small detail, ready to let it come into my life.\
  \ For the first time I took camera with me and rode in the train for about an hour\
  \ to the C-zone. It was raining a little, not even raining - it was drizzling, for\
  \ me, living in Saint Petersburg, it was familiar. So I felt thankful for that little\
  \ nostalgic present and without an umbrella I was walking along the trees, trying\
  \ to understand how to climb the hill. Then I saw two girls and decided to ask if\
  \ they know something about that. They said it was closed and offered to go back\
  \ to the subway together. We immediately got along with them and I, of course, wanted\
  \ to shoot them. Two girls: one is from Greece, second from Denmark - both looked\
  \ distinctive and friendly. I was not mistaken and we have spent together more than\
  \ an hour, I\u2019ve shown them one bookshop I really like and took warm pictures.\n\
  Sometimes I just think that at the end of the day things happen in the way they\
  \ have to.\nI\u2019ve met a couple of nice people after: asked if they didn\u2019\
  t mind being on my photos. I sent them photos in social nets, when I had finally\
  \ got home. But it would be later, after I would miss my ferry from Stockholm to\
  \ Finland and after I would wake up in the middle of the sea going in the wrong\
  \ direction. But at the end of the day things happen in the way they have to.\n\
  Here I am: sitting right in front of Alexanderplatz, eating my 3-euro wok and realizing\
  \ that I can be late for my plane. But it was a nice way to say goodbye, right?\
  \ I didn\u2019t want to do it, because I wanted to stay in the place that was and\
  \ still is special for me. I know a few locals in Berlin, most of the people I met\
  \ have come from somewhere. Trivially to say, but yes, it\u2019s cosmopolitan city\
  \ and that's the point of making a local connection here: to be cosmopolitan. That\
  \ time I said goodbye, but now I know that already in a month I would come back\
  \ to escape from melancholy, and I\u2019m sure that things happen in the way they\
  \ have to."
