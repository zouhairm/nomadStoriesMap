  I don''t wanna pictures for Instagram

  Just chill and rise with the Sun

  Hear Ukulele sounding nice chours

  Stars and skys, this music is yours


  I don''t wanna hear anybody talking

  I''m just going to enjoy lonely walking

  Not spending one single dirhan, ok

  There is no more money in my pocket


  Just wanna make my way alone

  Junping out from confort zone

  Let be in peace with the  Sunrise

  Stop lying, there is no more surprise


  No coffee or tours, just see desert''s sand

  Won''t pay, please try to understand

  Nature is all for free to see and feel

  Don''t try to force me climb up the hill


  Save your time and my good vibes

  I''m not interested in your fake tribes

  Don''t pretend you are my best friend

  Choice is mine, you don''t comprehend


  I don''t chose this way, as homeless

  Just tired of life 9 to 5 sick and stress

  I wanna a Life with someone to love

  And lots of adventures to live


  Our legs can take us where we want to go

  Wish someone can stop in this lonely Road

  Give me a ride and I can play you a Song

  Adventure doesn''t kill, makes me Strong


  I am feeling cold out here in the rain

  But I had no money to go in the Train

  I do not give a fuck to this world

  Crazy? My soul is not to be sold


  Tired of lyes, hipocrisy and ilusion

  Wanna more simplicity, less confusion

  Don''t waist my time, I can see it''s a lie

  More empath, or I turn and good bye


  Let''s make a good deal,

  Being clear and play for real,

  If doesn''t work, bye I am leaving

  Can''t get everything without giving'
