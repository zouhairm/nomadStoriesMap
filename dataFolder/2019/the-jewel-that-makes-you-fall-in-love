Text: "I booked this trip to Hawaii, knowing no one of the other people going. When\
  \ I arrived in Honolulu over eighty other people were there on the same trip, with\
  \ the same expectations, same dreams of how the week was going to turn out. The\
  \ week we spent there would make us get to know ourselves, the others and the Hawaiian\
  \ culture. We all got a refresher and new connections. Have you ever come back from\
  \ a trip feeling like a different person?\n\tIn Hawaii I was drawn to the culture\
  \ and love that the people of Hawaii spread. The locals were kind and had such big\
  \ hearts, they were all positive and polite, it was like I was on a different planet.\
  \ It did most certainly not feel like the United States. Hawaii is not like the\
  \ rest of the states, it is a jewel hidden in the Pacific Ocean with loving and\
  \ open minded people. \n\tThere were so many spots of the island that made you want\
  \ to sit down, breath and enjoy the sight and life in general. Being there felt\
  \ relaxing and calming, and the feeling of being in paradise made you feel at home.\
  \ Of course there were the surfer boys, that you imagine being on the island walking\
  \ around shirtless with their six packs and sunscreen on their face. But you also\
  \ had the local workers that lived a normal life on the island. There were people\
  \ just like you and me that had part time jobs at the Panda Express and went to\
  \ school. Likewise the people living in the other states they deal with stress and\
  \ challenges in their daily life, but for them the bad energy did not spread to\
  \ the people around them.\n\tGoing to Hawaii gave me a new insight of a lifestyle\
  \ different than the regular student life in America. I came back to Arizona feeling\
  \ like I needed to do something with myself, make a change and be happy. You can\
  \ not live your life unhappily and not do anything about it. Hawaii changed me for\
  \ the better, it made me appreciate the people around me and care more about other\
  \ people\u2019s happiness rather than my own struggles. \n\tHeading to Hawaii and\
  \ in all of the dreams about the trip and island. I did not expect to find myself,\
  \ and more about the culture differences from one state to another. Life in Honolulu\
  \ is way different than in Arizona. It is not only the life on the beach and the\
  \ sun that made Hawaii me fall in love with paradise, it was the atmosphere, and\
  \ the everyday people. The people that were driving the buses, the snorkeling and\
  \ surfing instructors, everyone made an impact and were all spreading Aloha. Aloha\
  \ means hello, goodbye and love, which is one simple word that expresses many things."
