Text: "It was a simple orange. Bright, pockmarked and battered from its journey concealed\
  \ within bursting bundles upon weary backs. It stood out like a cheery banner amid\
  \ the dust and flurry of travellers around me. As I peeled back its protective layer,\
  \ my nose tingled from the spurt of citrusy freshness; a welcome sensation that\
  \ cut through the stale, heavy air of palpable body odour, stress and weariness.\
  \ An unburdened smile again flooded my face. \n\nJust twenty minutes ago, the smile\
  \ had been a tight scowl growing deeper by the minute. My train back to Shanghai\
  \ seemed to be forever delayed, and while the exotic, green gardens of Suzhou were\
  \ paradisiacal as promised, my exhausted, sticky legs were begging to be somewhere\
  \ other than the hard plastic chair of the suffocating station. I had been in China\
  \ for nearly three weeks. I had even (shockingly) reached my limit in soup dumplings\
  \ and would go as far as saying I craved a cup of Tim Hortons coffee. The orange\
  \ changed everything. \n\nMoments before the simple fruit arrived in my palms, sitting\
  \ in that same, unwelcoming chair, I had caught the eye of a baby boy being bounced\
  \ lovingly on the lap of his grandmother. Her leathered hands were soft on his plump\
  \ rolls of skin and the baby\u2019s ruddy cheeks and tired squint spoke of a travel\
  \ day longer than mine. Giggling at my failed attempts to make him smile, the grandmother\
  \ crossed the aisle and eased herself into the seat next to me. I was apprehensive.\
  \ As a blonde woman traveling in China, I\u2019d had my fair share of unwarranted\
  \ photos, gawking, hair touches and holding babies for pictures. She began speaking\
  \ and I tentatively leaned closer to hear the cadenced whispers of an accented Mandarin\
  \ distinct from the confident chatter of Shanghai\u2019s city dialect. I couldn\u2019\
  t understand a word she said. She stared at me with encouragement after her sentence,\
  \ waiting. I blinked. Then we were off \u2013 laughter accompanied by wild gestures\
  \ in an attempt to be understood. Communicating despite a distinct lack of common\
  \ language. When we\u2019d made our points and the laughter had melted the weariness\
  \ of the day\u2019s travel from our features, she returned to where the rest of\
  \ her family peered from beyond a mountain of sacks. I turned back to my open book,\
  \ a small smile tugging at the corners of my mouth. \n\nFrom the edge of my page,\
  \ I saw the grandmother approaching again. With outstretched arms, she gently rolled\
  \ the orange into my cupped hands, smooth and soothing \u2013 a wordless gesture.\
  \ Behind her, it was snack time for the family, but of the fruit being feasted on,\
  \ the proffered gift in my palms was the largest. I stared at her in awe. From the\
  \ family\u2019s bags, clothes and the split pants of the baby, they were likely\
  \ villagers who didn\u2019t necessarily have much to give. Ensuring my acceptance,\
  \ she bobbed her head and quickly shuffled away. Perhaps she just wanted to hear\
  \ my attempt at saying \u201Cthank you\u201D in Mandarin, because I received a hoot\
  \ of laughter in response as the unfamiliar words fell tangled from my tongue and\
  \ out my lips. \n\nPeeled and ready, I hesitated before sinking my teeth into a\
  \ wedge of the humble orange. This woman had changed my day from travel-weary exhaustion\
  \ and frustration to an awakening moment of unexpected human connection. As she\
  \ monitored from afar, I bit into the sweet, rejuvenating flesh of the fruit and\
  \ beamed. Back on her lap between her kind and weary hands, her grandson bounced\
  \ unaware of the exchange and its significance. We are all connected. That fact\
  \ can be easy to forget until something as simple as an orange reminds us that we\
  \ are in this world together, even when it seems like we are worlds apart. An announcement\
  \ chimed in the distance about my train, bringing me back to the discomfort of my\
  \ seat and my sticky legs. Amongst the dust and dirt of a Chinese train station,\
  \ an orange made all the difference."
