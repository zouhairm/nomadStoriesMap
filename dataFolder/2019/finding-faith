Text: "The clip-clop of the horses\u2019 hooves can barely be heard over the sounds\
  \ of the deep, distant rumbling. The steep-angled, cobblestone trail is barely visible\
  \ beyond the next hairpin bend due to the rain and the thick fog that envelop us.\
  \ We are frozen on our steeds, holding on more due to the cold than for dear life.\
  \ After what feels like a lifetime, I finally hear the faint, gentle strains of\
  \ \u2018Daya Karo, Daya Karo\u2019. I sit up straight \u2013 just having heard the\
  \ Gurbani is emboldening.\n\nThe journey to the world's highest Gurudwara, Sri Hemkund\
  \ Sahib Ji \u2013 surrounded by seven mountains on the banks of a glacial Himalayan\
  \ lake at 15,197 feet \u2013 is nothing less than an odyssey.\n\nWe\u2019re trekkers\
  \ on steeds, wishing to see the stunning Himalayan landscape. We even harbour a\
  \ far-fetched dream of spying the elusive blooming Brahma Kamal, the legendary Himalayan\
  \ white star-like flower, which blooms for only one night in the entire year between\
  \ July and September. Its blooming has spiritual and sacred connotations and is\
  \ said to grant the wishes of those who see it. So, for us, journeying to Hemkund\
  \ was to be an experience.\n\nFor ardent Sikh devotees who trudge alongside us,\
  \ journeying to Hemkund is a pilgrimage. Snow-laden for a better part of the year,\
  \ Hemkund remains open only between May and September. In the teeth-chattering cold\
  \ of May, Sikh pilgrims repair the winter damage to the path, unmindful of the sub-zero\
  \ atmospheres \u2013 a tradition known as \u2018Kar Seva\u2019 (selfless service).\n\
  \nIt is on this path that we encounter Sikh devotees on a rainy August day when\
  \ they walk dressed in simple garb, smiles on their faces, muttering hymns under\
  \ their breath. While we\u2019re wrapped in layers, they don thin rain ponchos falling\
  \ to their knees. While we sit on steeds with essentials-full backpacks, they carry\
  \ only bare necessities. Our feet are covered in socks and shoes, while they march\
  \ wearing nothing but slippers. While we cannot wait to get to Hemkund, their belief\
  \ allows people of all ages to make the journey with ease.\n\nThe differences in\
  \ sensibilities are palpable.\n\nWarmth washes all over me as I set foot into the\
  \ Gurudwara, where the Raagis sing the Gurbani we heard from several hundred feet\
  \ down. It resonates in my ears as my feet sink into the soft carpet; almost incredulous\
  \ at this altitude. As we take blessings, we\u2019re served piping hot halwa prasad,\
  \ which assuages our winter-parched, frozen souls. No sooner than we step out of\
  \ the Gurudwara do we smell the delectable aroma rising from the langar. Huge vessels\
  \ and pots with khichdi and steaming tea are being stirred with gusto on wood fires,\
  \ the soothing heat making me want to sink comfortably to the floor. I ask the chef\
  \ standing nearest to me when he comes to Hemkund. Early May, he says, since the\
  \ wood is of no use when the snow falls in September, he adds rather reproachfully,\
  \ I think. If given a choice, I don\u2019t think they ever will, continuing their\
  \ selfless service with utmost joy.\n\nWe finally arrive at the freezing jade vastness\
  \ of Hemkund, the actual lake on the banks of which the Gurudwara is built. While\
  \ I cannot gather the courage to even dip my toe in, a family of merry Sikh boys\
  \ and men arrive. They are at their raucous best \u2013 until they reach the daunting\
  \ emerald expanse that is. Their eyes closed and their palms folded in reverence,\
  \ they plunge into the icy waters of the glacial lake. With their faces clear of\
  \ any distress, their raucousness is replaced by reverence.\n\nNeedless to say,\
  \ we choose to walk our way down, my pace somewhat measured as I see Hemkund vanish\
  \ behind the fog curtain yet again. We do see the Brahma Kamal too; in the form\
  \ of a closed bud. However, I have no doubt \u2013 what with the images of belief\
  \ playing in my head \u2013 that somewhere, the Brahma Kamal is indeed in full bloom.\n\
