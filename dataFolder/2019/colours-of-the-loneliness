Text: "I went to the phillipines in 2017. That was very unexpected because I've no\
  \ idea that I'd be able to go there although I've ever mentioned when I was in junior\
  \ high school that I'd visit the country once in my life to meet my social media\
  \ friend. I got a scholarship or something like a summer school for around 10 days.\
  \ I wasn't so excited because I did not really 'fall in' to the country back then.\
  \ For a few days I've struggled so much just to eat or drink something because there\
  \ were no many shops near the hotel. I could finally ate something at 7 pm everyday.\
  \ It was really insane for me because I must also struggled that I have until now\
  \ this bad stomachache every single time. I could not also eat some foods due to\
  \ my beliefs. Even worse when I had to walk like 1-3 km just to reached the class.\
  \ Everyone liked to have walk. I did not. At that time. \n\nThere were many big\
  \ trees all over the universities, everything seems so calm and green but there\
  \ were no air. Like sauna. Air came by only when there were some vehicles. \nI really\
  \ did not like this kind of sensation. I've struggled so much til I said to my friends\
  \ that I really didn't want to go back there. \n\nBut there came days when I finally\
  \ felt joys and I just realized it these days. There were times when after the class,\
  \ i got to see the locals and shops at the traditional but very small market. I\
  \ really enjoyed and loved it when I got to buy some juices. It was a shop of heaven.\
  \ There were many fruits with such beautiful colors. The only place I could really\
  \ enjoyed so much."
