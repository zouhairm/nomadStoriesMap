Text: "Do that crows meditate too?\nI wake up before sunrise without alarm ringing.\
  \ It seems Goa at least gave me the energy, which I came here for. But my thoughts\
  \ are about birds now: the only Morjim noise (except bikes on the road) is strangely\
  \ absent.\nI come out and notice the second missing thing \u2013 bright white teeth\
  \ all around. \xABGood morning!\xBB - smile was already on the face, before we met.\
  \ \xABHow\u2019s your Arpora Night Market catch?\xBB - smile rising wider, for me\
  \ especially.\nI would answer: \xABShopping was great, but I really tired after\
  \ hours spending by my friends enamored and passionate to bargain infinitely with\
  \ Indian magicians of commerce\xBB. Tired physically to sleep well.\nWhat a difference\
  \ with the oppressive fatigue of big city of Moscow. You can look for a human smile\
  \ there like a knight with a torch searches his stolen ladylove in the dark of medieval\
  \ streets - and never get lucky. \nBut nobody is waiting for my words now: last\
  \ days i wake up later. And minutes before sunrise the stuff of guest house is having\
  \ a rest, like the silent nighty crowns. They both need it before the working day.\
  \ The first ones will cook and serve food, the second \u2013 try to stole it from\
  \ tables while tourists will chill in the sea.\nSometimes waiters will drive birds\
  \ away, but slowly, calm, without any malice and aggression. Because people live\
  \ in harmony with nature here. Nobody ruins winged thieves' nests over the roofs\
  \ of the cafes. The whole stuff feed the dog who gave birth to ten puppies right\
  \ here, in the hotel. \xABThey itch because of fleas, we use medical powder, but\
  \ could catch not all of them to apply it - they run and play, you know\xBB -Tilak\
  \ from reception explained carefully to me, observing doggies battle, which was\
  \ interrupted for carding.\nWith these short memories (worthy of youtube with it\u2019\
  s \xABohh how sweet-effect\xBB) I make a step on the beach. The sun is hiding behind\
  \ the palms and buildings now, going to attack from the back, but hardly lurk. The\
  \ sky splits it out, becoming completely cartoon pink. Sand echoes him, reflecting\
  \ the shade, and the great Morjim coastline seems even wider.\nI turn right. Small\
  \ waves softly sound to my left and beautiful yoga masters greet the sun to another\
  \ side. I go to the fishermen village. Yesterday I didn\u2019t make a single snapshot\
  \ there, because remembered one editor\u2019s words: those people don't look atmospheric\
  \ enough for that terrain. And my new friends put out to sea wearing regular European\
  \ t-shirts. \nI'm even in a little hurry, such not a South Indian thing! More look\
  \ like runners who overtake me here and now, splashing through the sea\u2019s edge\
  \ with their feet.\nThis is because I just understand the reason of my early rise.\
  \ Somewhere, in my dream, I\u2019ve realized that \xABatmosphere of place\xBB here\
  \ is not about Indian style, white clothes, bracelets and headscarves. It\u2019\
  s about calm doing small things with great love.\nI smile for the new meeting with\
  \ the fisherman Rami, find out whether i can photograph him while he washes the\
  \ boat and ask how he is doing, whether he was able to rest after yesterday evening\
  \ fishing. \xABI slept about four hours, not five as usual\xBB, - he says. \xAB\
  But I am grateful for this, because the today\u2019s catch is good\xBB. And then\
  \ I make my best shots."
