Text: "The river cut a mile down, exposing a tangle of ribbons in reds and yellows,\
  \ taupe and burnt orange. Each layer of stone pancaked one on top of the other and\
  \ jutted out at intervals in wide steppes and plateaus. The slopes that fell away\
  \ before us were hung with dusty greens. The early evening light was angular and\
  \ sharp as the sun sank toward the horizon and steeped ridges in a golden haze,\
  \ flinging black shadows behind them. \nThis was our first vista over the Grand\
  \ Canyon.\n\nWe sat there long after the orange-brushed sky turned dark and the\
  \ other visitors returned to their camps. I pushed back against the darkness and\
  \ tried to recreate the grandeur of the canyon in my mind. It was right in front\
  \ of me, but I couldn\u2019t grasp it. I began to contemplate another measure of\
  \ the canyon: time. The time it took to build this land from mud and sand and the\
  \ skeletons of tiny sea creatures. The time it took to press each of those colors\
  \ to stone. And then the time it took to carve through them one by one. \n\nI was\
  \ exceedingly preoccupied with time that trip. We had a tight schedule, Guillaume\
  \ and I, with only three weeks and so much to see. There was time to make up, canyons\
  \ of our own to bridge. \n\nWe had been planning this road trip since April. Now\
  \ it was August and most of the four months since we started dating had been spent\
  \ in different countries on different continents in different time zones. It had\
  \ seemed endless, the countdown to see each other again, but now it was here and\
  \ we were going to make the most of our time.\n\nThe following morning, we joined\
  \ a park ranger from South Carolina and the rest of the fossil hunters, still blinking\
  \ sleep from their eyes. The air was warm and dusty as we walked together along\
  \ the Rim Trail, stopping on a wide outcropping of rock already stamped with the\
  \ prints of hiking boots that had come before us. The side of the canyon unfolded\
  \ behind the ranger.\n\nHe asked us for a minute of silence, sixty seconds to stand\
  \ vigil and see the canyon. See, he said, not look at.\n\n\u201CI walk by this spot\
  \ every morning before work and every evening on my way home.\u201D His words were\
  \ an appeal \u2013 don\u2019t make the same mistake I did. \u201CIt\u2019s one of\
  \ the best spots along the Southern Rim and most of the time I don\u2019t actually\
  \ see it.\u201D\n\nWhen I was younger and my shins would hurt, my mother would tell\
  \ me it was growing pains. Just growing pains \u2013 give it a little time and it\
  \ will go away. Now, as I listened to the history of the Grand Canyon in that long\
  \ and slow Southern Carolina drawl, I wondered if the land here had its own growing\
  \ pains. \n\n280 million years ago much of what is now Arizona, New Mexico, and\
  \ Utah was a tropical marshland where dragonflies grew to have 12-inch wingspans.\
  \ Over the next five million years the tropics turned to desert. The dragonflies\
  \ disappeared and mountainous sand dunes dominated the landscape. Another five million\
  \ years, our ranger said with a snap of his fingers, and the whole area was a shallow\
  \ sea where corals thrived alongside sponges and sharks.\n\nThe river, so deep in\
  \ the canyon now that you couldn\u2019t see it from where we stood, came later,\
  \ only beginning to craft the canyon five million years ago. The waters wound through\
  \ a shallow riverbed across the plateau and bit by bit clamored deeper. Year by\
  \ year you wouldn\u2019t have noticed the change, but centuries at a time the walls\
  \ of the canyon were washed away.\n\nAs the ranger spoke, he pointed to each layer\
  \ of stone. \n\nI saw it then. The colored ribbons solidified into a pattern, linear\
  \ and consistent. They told us the canyon\u2019s story, eager to share what had\
  \ been there before being washed away by time.\n\nI reached for Guilluame\u2019\
  s hand and four months, those 112 days that I had counted down, were nothing more\
  \ than growing pains."
