Text: "I lived in China for one month last year, and even if I did not get the chance\
  \ to visit it all (this is just a mission impossible) I am proud of what I was able\
  \ to experience. My trip began in Shanghai, a huge metropolis where the air is often\
  \ unbreathable and the sky that foggy that you can't even see on the other side\
  \ of the river Hang Pu. However, it is not always like that. On the contrary the\
  \ sky is quite often sunny and clear, and this makes it perfect to bike around,\
  \ of course, being always extremely careful. Why? Well, with almost 1.5 billion\
  \ people living in the same region, you are never too careful when crossing the\
  \ street, especially if people drive like crazy. I once saw this absurdely image\
  \ in front of my eyes: a father was manually pulling an old cart with 6 kids on\
  \ it and some goods he probably planned to sell, between two huge skyscrapers and\
  \ many international shops. It was just shocking experiencing these two so different\
  \ realities, suddenly juxtaposed one to the other, without an apparent sense behind\
  \ it. But China is all about these kinds of contrast, so step by step you get use\
  \ to it. \nAgain in Shanghai, it happens very often that you are perhaps walking\
  \ on a main street and then turning right, you end up finding yourself in a place\
  \ that doesn't have anything to do with the previous one: for instance, Rolex and\
  \ Maserati stores, being which people are starving, without electricity or drinkable\
  \ water. \nThis becomes even more real if you decide to take a trip to one of the\
  \ closely village. Zhujiaojiao is one of these, perhaps the more emblematic given\
  \ that it is also called the Chinese Venice. Zhujiaojiao in fact, is all about bridges,\
  \ hanging terraces that seem about to fall into the water and little kennels. Local\
  \ people more from one place to the other using a sort of pagoda, that really has\
  \ some similarity with the Venetian gondola. They live mainly off the food they\
  \ are able to get from the surroundings water, so small fish, eels, seaweeds and\
  \ similar. The smell of these dishes can get pretty strong in some of the narrow\
  \ streets, especially during a hot day. Nevertheless, also in Zhujiaojiao I found\
  \ all the international chains such as Starbucks or KFC, and I didn't appreciate\
  \ it since I thought they were contaminating the pureness of the village. \nThe\
  \ same applies for Beijing, even if this is a slightly different stories. Beijing\
  \ compared to Shanghai is much more a historic and austere place, and this derives\
  \ from the fact that we are comparing the (modern) capital of a country to an international\
  \ metropolis. Beijing in particular, it's one of the only places where you can find\
  \ the traditional Hutongs, extremely narrow streets that lead into old traditional\
  \ neighbours. They are not hard to find, you just need to know which one is safe\
  \ and which one you should keep far from. Thankfully I had a Chinese friend that\
  \ was walking me around so I felt really blessed to be visiting with him. But, nonetheless,\
  \ my visit at a local hutong was extremely impressive and (I would not deny it)\
  \ overwhelming. He took me for what he called barbecue, to this super tiny and impossible\
  \ to find restaurant (if you are not a local), which was packed with people. He\
  \ then ordered for both, since there was not a menu and the waiter did just speak\
  \ Chinese. He got the most unimaginable food: lamb kidney, cow vocal cords, pigs\
  \ ears and cow tongue and also some just-chicken for my joy. The fun part came when\
  \ I wanted to go to the toilet. Ok, of course the \"restaurant\" (more like a shack)\
  \ did not have any, so I had to go to some common ones. There were no doors and\
  \ approximately 9 squat toilets, one next to the other. The people inside did not\
  \ seem to bother when I arrived, but of course I was visibly embarrassed. \nBut\
  \ I learnt and discovered. So my love for China would only just keep to grow!"
