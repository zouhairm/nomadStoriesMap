Text: "Shimmering orange sands, hazy blue skies and the friendly \u201CMarhaba\u201D\
  \ called out from shops sculpted my first memories of Jordan. Yes, there was also\
  \ that unfortunate late-night detour off Airport Road into then-troubled Zarqa,\
  \ leading to my interrogation by various security officials for the remainder of\
  \ the night. Then again, had we simply stuck to the routine questions and not deviated\
  \ into football and various topics of culture, theirs and mine, I\u2019m sure I\
  \ would\u2019ve hit the sack hours earlier. That is Jordan for you - people who\
  \ care about people. But who would\u2019ve guessed that on the second trip my wife\
  \ and I would be facing a fanatic looking, shotgun-wielding youth, on the edge of\
  \ a cliff and potentially the unmarked and early check out of our young lives?\n\
  \ \nDuring early 2011 the Arab Spring also washed through the Jordanian streets,\
  \ voices clamoring for institutional change. Blood had already flowed in various\
  \ countries, but King Abdullah managed to maintain the calm. Around the same time\
  \ transition knocked on our door, with a work transfer out of the Middle East. It\
  \ was time for a last regional trip, and where better than a return to Jordan. \n\
  \nMy Libyan colleague wasn\u2019t too happy about our destination of choice. Flare-ups\
  \ still sporadically occurred and the evening news kept hammering it in: danger,\
  \ danger\u2026\n\nArrival queues are short at Queen Alia International Airport.\
  \ Getting on the road: a breeze. Each Jordanian we meet... pleased to help. Little\
  \ diversions into Ammani neighborhoods open tiny windows into the realities of daily\
  \ Middle Eastern life. Before reaching the Dead Sea, an off-duty soldier invites\
  \ us for tea, but unsure about local tensions, we politely decline. Salty water,\
  \ healthy mud and a sublime sunset just seem, well, more appetizing. \n\nAt Petra\
  \ we meet up with friends, exploring its carved rose-red sandstone facades, amphitheaters,\
  \ cave homes. All day long exploring and exchanging pleasantries with locals. Their\
  \ warmth is overwhelming, as is the beauty of every nook and cranny in that valley.\n\
  \nAll too soon we bid our goodbyes, heading south. The King\u2019s Highway leads\
  \ us to an impressive ravine, worthy of photographic immortalization. It reminds\
  \ me of a rhino\u2019s wrinkled mouth. An old truck filled with young Jordanians\
  \ pulls up next to us\u2026 \u201CYou ok, you need help?\u201D one greets in heavily\
  \ accented English. \u201CAll ok, just photo!\u201D we reply, \u201COk, good. Bye!\u201D\
  \ and off they disappear in their exhaust fumes.\n\nIn the small town of Rajif we\
  \ bump into them again. \u201CYou ok, you need help?\u201D I joke back at them,\
  \ drawing laughter. Then the big question, \u201CYou come eat my house?\u201D Unrushed\
  \ and now accustomed to the Jordanians\u2019 human warmth, we take them up on the\
  \ lunch invite. Our new friends\u2019 dad, a resident policeman, is cooking lamb\
  \ and rice that specific Tuesday. Our luck is in. \n\nWith broken sentences and\
  \ crazy hand conversations, we get to know Khaled and family. After-lunch talk turns\
  \ to showing us some of the beauty of their region \u201C...if we can go in your\
  \ car\u201D. With our guard down, stomachs full, and a warm sun dulling the senses,\
  \ we all hop into the car, down the winding single lane on a cliff\u2019s macabre\
  \ edge. \u201CStop! Stop here now,\u201C our host exclaims, then jumps out. We see\
  \ a beaten old Merc bearing down straight at us. The vehicle kicks up dust on a\
  \ hard brake. The young fanatic looking driver stares intensely at us, races to\
  \ the back of the Merc, emerges cocking a shotgun. What the... Thoughts bursting\
  \ forth at whirlwind speeds. My wife and I say our unspoken goodbyes through a firm\
  \ press of our hands. Nobody knows our location but for these fellows. Goodbye Jordan,\
  \ goodbye life.\n\n\u201CMy cousin. He shows shoot falcon for Emirati sell.\u201D\
  \n\nLife flows back into our bodies. Yousef the Cousin aims at a falcon flying overhead\
  \ with his salt shot, but I\u2019d rather not see this shot. Relief! Hello Jordan,\
  \ hello life!\n\nYousef\u2019s rescued animal farm rounds off an extraordinary day\
  \ and embeds the Jordanian people firmly in our hearts.\n\nMy name is Rickus, and\
  \ I love my wife. And secretly - Jordan."
