Text: "It was a plan for his birthday trip. But we did not arrange anything in advance.\
  \ We booked the car a day prior to the road trip and we booked accomodation along\
  \ the way. It was all a mess in the beginning. We had a very brief itinerary, which\
  \ was to depart from Melbourne, went up to Mount Grampians for a hike (which turned\
  \ out to be a hiked down to look at Mackenzie Falls), rushed to Horsham to relax.\
  \ \n\nThen, we embarked on the journey to South Australia and experienced the world\
  \ of wine tasting and vineyard hopping in Barossa Valley on our first day of arrival.\
  \ Not only we enjoyed the range of wines the land had to offer, we also indulged\
  \ in the scenic drive along the towns of Tanunda and Krondorf. After tasting and\
  \ buying a few bottle of wines, we headed off to Adelaide Inn (our accomodation)\
  \ to rest. The next day, we decided to drive to McLaren Vale and got cultured on\
  \ their great range of wine produced in the southern region of South Australia.\
  \ The region offered a range of vineyard, from sophisticated like d'Arenberg cube\
  \ to the beautiful garden-like winery like the Coriole Vineyard. All in all, both\
  \ regions offer not only great and beautiful choices to the tastebuds, but also\
  \ to people's sights. \n\nTo end the journey, we decided to go south through Coonawarra,\
  \ the last wine region that we got to visit in our short trip of five days. Sadly,\
  \ it was raining that day, and we only got through to two beautiful vineyards. We\
  \ then said goodbye to South Australia and stopped by Town Hill as our first stop\
  \ back to Victoria. Here, we visited the Tower Hill Wildlife Reserve, where we encountered\
  \ real-life big bird emu, and a few other indigenous animals to Australia, such\
  \ as koalas and kangaroos. After a short day at Tower Hill, we rushed to our accomodation\
  \ in Port Fairy, a beautiful little town which is a four-hour drive from Melbourne.\
  \ It is not very far away from the Great Ocean Road, so people could consider stopping\
  \ at Port Fairy to enjoy the scenic view this little town has to offer. We did a\
  \ last stroll at the Griffiths Island and drove back to Melbourne.\n\nIt was an\
  \ unplanned, yet a memorable trip. And I hope to experience more of this kind of\
  \ trip as it brought not only new experiences, but also joy to the heart and smile\
  \ to the face."
