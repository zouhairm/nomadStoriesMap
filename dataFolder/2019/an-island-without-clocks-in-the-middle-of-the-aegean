Text: "What if i told you that in the middle of the Aegean sea exists an island very\
  \ different from the ones you have imagined or visited until now?\nAn island where\
  \ time doesn't play a significant role, people care about enjoying life to the fullest\
  \ and organize little festivals every day for almost one month. And except from\
  \ this festival spirit, the island hides amazing beaches, which one can enjoy before\
  \ or after eating in the local restaurants, where the owners cook only with products\
  \ from their private gardens. \nThis island, which seems to preserve habits from\
  \ the past and is lost between the past and the present, is the beautiful island\
  \ of Ikaria. \nIkaria is an island i had the ability to visit during the summer\
  \ and there i understood why people who go there for the first time, always return\
  \ back.\nBut why the visitors of this island always go back to it?\nFirst of all,\
  \ because everyone has the ability to spent all their time near to the magical seaside.\
  \ There are beaches for all kind of tastes. Armenistis, is a beach for the ones\
  \ who want to enjoy surfing during the windy days. Nas, a beach connected with a\
  \ little lake is the best place to take your tent and relax until the dawn. Then,\
  \ a beach that everyone visits is Seychelles and of course with a very good reason\
  \ behind it. Seychelles, is a beach with crystal waters between huge rocks where\
  \ you can get by boat or by walking among enormous rocks (so don't forget to take\
  \ your sneakers)\nDespite the difficult route, is a beach where everyone gets lost\
  \ and gives you the feeling that you are lost in the Caribbean sea.\nAfter the wonderful\
  \ time near the sea, there is always a little restaurant (taverna) near the beaches\
  \ where locals cook delicious snacks and they are always ready to explain you the\
  \ local specialties. But be careful, don't wait for your orders immediately. The\
  \ locals may have a talk with you before cooking the meal and then prepare it, so\
  \ even if it comes after half and hour don't be surprised!\nAnd then there are the\
  \ little festivals, called panigiria. Panigiria, are festivals that are being held\
  \ in different villages of the island that start around 11 in the evening and finish\
  \ 8 in the morning. People dance all night traditional greek dances and waltz,drink\
  \ wine and eat local snacks meeting each other and getting closer. If you are lucky\
  \ enough you can also find panigiri in another village that lasts from the morning\
  \ until late in the evening.\nPeople never forget the feelings they experienced\
  \ during panigiria and this is why it's worth visiting an island where everyone\
  \ can experience a different way of partying all night long.\nAn island, as Ikaria,\
  \ where people have as a main goal of their lives to enjoy life and also have the\
  \ longest life expectancy in Europe, is a magical place where modern people can\
  \ find some answers to their questions about their everyday lives. An island, where\
  \ people get lost in order to find what they have lost due to the intensive ways\
  \ of living their life."
