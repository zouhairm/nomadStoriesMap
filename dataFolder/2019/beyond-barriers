Text: "A solo trip for a 19 year old, Indian girl from a middle class family wasn't\
  \ something the people around her would approve of. They would call her delusional,\
  \ too upfront, too out there, cause she was told she could never be 'too mucg',\
  \ only 'just enough'. So, she ran away. \nTwo train rides, delayed beyond ten hours,\
  \ stepping out on the wet streets of Delhi, her thoughts wandered off to her parents'\
  \ warnings. There was a hint of regret. \nThe place she wanted to visit was called\
  \ 'Shimla'. She'd heard of it, but never been. She had a ticket but her bus was\
  \ gone. So, the 19 year old did the next thing she could do. She hitchhiked. \n\
  The couple was wonderful, but it wasn't the end of her obstacles. \nSnow blocked\
  \ the roads ahead of her, but she wasn't worried. She was mesmerized. The snow felt\
  \ soft and cold under her fingers. For that moment, everything seemed worth it.\
  \ Until, it didn't. \nThere was no place to sleep. It was late at night. Spending\
  \ the night in a car parked in the middle of a forest didn't seem like the best\
  \ of ideas. \nSomeone spotted an abandoned bus depot and the party of three moved\
  \ there with their luggage. Fortunately, there wasn't many. \nThe girl tucked in\
  \ deep inside her thin blanket and four layers of coats but the cold still seeped\
  \ in. \nIt was a long night. \nWhen the dawn broke, the couple was gone. The abandoned\
  \ depot looked bigger in the daylight, sunlight peeping in through the broken windows.\
  \ The first thing she did was check her belongings. \nEverything was intact. \n\
  She sat there for a while and she cried. And then she wiped her tears, got them,\
  \ collected her luggage, and was up on her way. \nHer phone was dead. \nShe walked\
  \ along the snow covered ground, without a GPS, without friends, and without much\
  \ hope. \nAn hour had passed when her eyes fell on the town of Shimla, still a million\
  \ miles away. A little bit of the lost hope seeped in. \nIt got better when colourful\
  \ people started popping up. She asked them for directions, and they gave it to\
  \ her. \nAfter multiple hours had passed since she'd left the depot, the crowd started\
  \ thickening; the road beneath the snow started appearing, and the commotion of\
  \ daily lives were being heard. \nShe smiled, less at herself and more at the white\
  \ town of Shimla. In her mind, she decided that the town was overrated and she probably\
  \ wouldn't come back here again. \nIn her mind, she also decided that at this point,\
  \ she would rather be here than anywhere else."
