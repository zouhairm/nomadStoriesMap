Text: "Our trip started in Bratislava and we landed to Eindhoven, Netherlands. So,\
  \ a first stop was Eindhoven. One of biggest cities there, not so noisy as Amsterdam\
  \ or Rotterdam for example, on the other hand ,it had a beautiful authentic atmosphere.\
  \ Furthermore, everywhere were bicycles. MANY BICYCLES! So magical. If I would have\
  \ to describe our journey just by three words,it would be sounds like - Funward\
  \ trip ever!  When we arrived to Eindhoven as first we needed to find bus stop for\
  \ our route. I just don\xB4t forget to say, first unknown experience was Couchsurfing\
  \ for us. I think it is unnecessary to describe to people what that service is.\
  \ Almost everyone know it, but if you not- It is website for searching free accommodation\
  \ ,which is provide by residents to you. I mean it is not such a free service because\
  \ it\xB4s polite to bring something from your country for example as a gift. This\
  \ service is the best when you want to meet new people and more understand that\
  \ culture of country where you are. We finally arrived to our accommodation something\
  \ little before midnight. We get off one stop sooner and then we were little bit\
  \ lost, but everything ended well. First challenge done. :D As I said, Eindhoven\
  \ is magical city with fresh air, everything is so clear and people are really nice.\
  \ However, everyone who visited Netherlands must see Capital city. We weren\xB4\
  t exception. After three days we moved to Amsterdam.\n\nThat city invited us as\
  \ an each big city do. Very noisy-CHAOS, MANY PEOPLE, CARS, BUSES, TRAINS, BICYCLES,\
  \ BICYCLES AND BICYCLES! We were excited but also little bit nervous, I guess. We\
  \ had a plan for our first day there- Vincent Van Gogh museum was first stop- early\
  \ morning. I need to say that we all little bit as Alice in Wonderland so it was\
  \ kind of funny- to find our bus route. When we found it- we found out the next\
  \ interest about Netherlands- buses are on time as Japanese trains. Really! Me and\
  \ my one friend got stucked in the bus door by driver( so kind, because she was\
  \ hurry and she started knock on her watch :D ) and my second friend didn\xB4t get\
  \ on bus, driver closed the door front of her and we left her behind us. It was\
  \ little bit interesting, if you know what I mean. Great so we are in the unknown\
  \ big city and that we were divided. We started call each other but for fun, our\
  \ nice friend which got stucked on the station didn\xB4t picked up phone. She is\
  \ kinda a very positive and an open-minded person- so she was like \"nevermind\"\
  . Fortunately we have found each other and have a great experience in Vincent Van\
  \ Gogh museum. I love this painter so much, it was my dream. Then in evening I had\
  \ other dream experience- yes- Anna Frank house. It was such a speechless experience.\
  \ But now I don\xB4t wanna talk more about this experience but after this. As our\
  \ second accommodation was bungalow \"nearby\" Amsterdam ( we just thought is near).\
  \ We found this bungalow on Airbnb. It was located in a village near Amsterdam,\
  \ but as I said it wasn\xB4t so near but nevermind, we he had an adrdress and again\
  \ almost in midnight we had looking for this accommodation. (Yes we are not good\
  \ time managers, but that trip was spontaneous, honestly it was the most spontaneous\
  \ thing in my life.) So we found the street then we searched a number of house,\
  \ so 25,26,27,28,...31. Ok our 29 nowhere. We called the renter, and he said it\
  \ not good address, we need to go 2 or 3 streets further, my friend did a deal with\
  \ him that he made a order for taxi for us. Finally when a taxi came- it was black\
  \ big car, with smiley rider in a tuxedo and with strong fragrance.First strange\
  \ thing- big black car, second- he - because he was smiling at MIDNIGHT!!!AT WORK\
  \ ! Too weirdo. My positive friend get on as first, then me and a second friend.\
  \ We also made a plan as escape if would be need :D but it wouldn\xB4t. Hilarious\
  \ trip."
