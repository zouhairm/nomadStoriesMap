Text: "Remember 9 - 11? September 11, 2001... We all remember where we were that day\
  \ or the next day. And the grainy images of the planes smashing into the twin towers\
  \ in New York. Clear blue autumn day. Or fall as the Americans say. After that the\
  \ international airport security changed forever.\n\nYears later, Me and my friend\
  \ Panod Srisuwannawanitwong were still studying at Thammasat University in Bangkok.\
  \ Thai family names have up to 18 syllables. Nicknames make communication easier\
  \ and also intriguing. Everything from \u201CKopp\u201D frog \u201CMuu\u201D pig,\
  \ to \u201CGolf\u201D and \u201CLekk\u201D small size, \u201COuan\u201D fat to \u201C\
  VTEC\u201D my cousin who\u2019s father drives a Honda Civic sedan VTEC engine.\n\
  Panod got his nickname \u201CBomb\u201D because his father liked the 60s Doo-Wop\
  \ hit song \u201CWho Put the Bomp\u201D.\n\nPanod, \u201CBomb\u201D was a good student.\
  \ Sino-Thai ancestors. From Hainan, like the famous S\u2019pore Hainanese Chicken\
  \ Rice. Panod\u2019s extended family including Chinese grandmother Amah. \n\nAfter\
  \ our graduation we decided to visit England. Panod wanted to visit the Greenwich\
  \ Mean Time memorial. \u201CI wanna see how mean the MEAN time is\u201D. \u201C\
  Is it 12 AM/PM or 12:00?\u201D We both hated AM/PM! Especially on sign with fonts,\
  \ like comic sens on hole-in- the wall restaurants. 12:00 PM\n\u201CIf you use military\
  \ time 24 hour time. You\u2019ll never miss a plane\u201D, said Panod. \u201COne\
  \ of our close relatives Khun Nok, the Bird arrived in time for the 9 PM departure.\
  \ Departure 09:00!\u201D She was devastated. New ticket! Amah almost cried. This\
  \ AM/PM American bull shit has got to stop!\u201D\n\nPanod loved to travel. He had\
  \ flown twice to Singapore. He arrived three hours before departure to do some plane\
  \ spotting. Domestic travels. He had been to 50 of Thailand\u2019s 77 provinces.\
  \ He planned visit them all except the southernmost Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala\
  \ bordering Malaysia\u2019s Muslim northern states. His relative, a teacher was\
  \ killed by a roadside terrorist bomb outside a Buddhist temple. \u201CThey don\u2019\
  t call them terrorists? Our generals call the insurgents. \u201CWhat the hell is\
  \ the difference?\u201D\n\u201CThey used to have an office in Sweden\u201D. You\
  \ should know you father is from Sweden! \u201C PULO Pattani United Liberation Organization,\
  \ in northern Sweden! FUUUUCK!\n\u201CAmah says the three provinces have No Future,\
  \ there are bombs going off almost weekly and innocent Buddhists including monks\
  \ and conscripts blown to pieces. Don\u2019t ever go there!!!\u201D\nNeither of\
  \ us had ever been to the UK. London. Panod or should I say \u201CBomb\u201D that\u2019\
  s what everyone called him including family and friends. \n\nBomb needed a visa.\
  \ My EU passport did not. \nDeparture day. We meet at Bangkok Suwarnabhumi International\
  \ Airport. Pronounced \u201CSu- wanna-boom\u201D. Bomb and the his whole family\
  \ is there including Amah. He looks excited. All dressed up. Jeans and a big jacket,\
  \ turtleneck and a baseball cap on his head. You\u2019re wearing a turtleneck! \u201C\
  It\u2019s being slowly strangled by a weak person. He says \u201CWhatever\u201D\
  \ Then his father takes aside and tells look after Bomb, please. \u201CHe is a bit\
  \ tense and this is the first time he is travelling to Europe. Don\u2019t let him\
  \ out of you sight. \u201CI promise!\u201D\n\n\n TG 910. BKK-LON 0015. No am/pm.\
  \ No confusion! The plane an old 747 rattling and squeaking during take-off. Bomb\
  \ is glued to the window, which stubbornly calls a porthole. \u201CLike captain,\
  \ rudder and bulkhead. This is actually a SHIP. Where are we landing? At a PORT.\
  \ Airport\u201D\nFinal approach to London. Grey morning 0620. Immigration and customs.\
  \ Suddenly I loose Panood! He disappears in crowd. Then I spot his red ball cap\
  \ near a Starbucks store. I stand on my toes and call, loudly. BOMB!!! BOMB!!!\n\
  BOMB!!! Shortly thereafter I am tackled to the ground by two burly security officers.\n\
  I am taken to an immigration security interrogation room. The red faced officer\
  \ with cockney accent. \u201CYou say your friend\u2019s Thai nickname is BOMB! \u201C\
  Are you making fun of us? I don\u2019t care if it is Taiwan or Thailand!\u201D We\
  \ will find him if he exists! Mr BOMB!\u201D\n\nCALLING FOR PASSENGER MR PANOD SRISUWANNAWANITWONG\
  \ ARRIVING ON FLIGHT TG 910 FROM BANGKOK. PLEASE GO TO INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY!!!"
