Text: "As someone living in a country with 2 seasons all year long, dry and rainy\
  \ season, I always look for places where I can experience the other seasons. As\
  \ much as it is a clich\xE9, escaping reality is as truest as it gets for me. \n\
  \nFor some reason, winter has always had it in for me. I love the bone-chilling\
  \ temperature, snugging inside a bonfire-lit room with hands clutching a warm cup\
  \ of dark chocolate looking outside the window seeing a snow-laiden road with moderate\
  \ to heavy snowfalls. The list of things I would do to experience this everytime\
  \ I want to would get ugly real fast.\n\nSo in my latest travelling opportunities,\
  \ naturally I look for countries which are affordable to me in terms of ticket price\
  \ and accomodation yet still can give me the above experience. My decision fell\
  \ on Japan. It's not that out of reach distance-wise (mind you, I'm a regular office\
  \ worker with limited days of leave accessible), the plane ticket is relatively\
  \ cheap (lots of travel promos), and did I mention I love Japanese food?\n\nSo me\
  \ and my friend booked a flight on early February (for me, the perfect timing to\
  \ go to Japan, will tell you the reasoning behind it later in my story). We went\
  \ to the liveliest city I have ever seen so far in my life, Tokyo. The hustling\
  \ citylife is real. Crowded streets with people walking in all sorts of paces, packed-up\
  \ food stalls with heavenly aroma, and those colorful super catchy billboard advertisements\
  \ all over the city. One of the reason why I say February is the best time to visit\
  \ Japan? Just look at the people walking the street. It's practically a fashion\
  \ show with so many beautiful coats, boots, purses, gloves, everything from subtle\
  \ and functional to all the way outrageous and full of personality.\n\nAs much beuatiful\
  \ things as Tokyo provides, my main story is about another place. Advertised a lot,\
  \ yes, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The place is called Shirakawago.\
  \ I won't bother you with a whole paragraph just talking about ways to get there,\
  \ because it is really a simple click away and you're set to go. So fast forward\
  \ to the bus ride I took from Takayama (a small town about an hour of bus drive\
  \ away to Shirakawago), which was beautiful in every sense possible. My bus got\
  \ stuck for a good 10 minutes somewhere near the entrance of the tunnel because\
  \ of a heavy snow and the road is laiden with thick layer of snow. It was -7 degrees\
  \ Celsius outside and even with heater inside the bus, i could feel the chilling\
  \ wind just an inch away from my fingertips.\n\n10 minutes later we headed on inside\
  \ a mile-long tunnel with just enough lighting to enable the driver to drive safely.\
  \ Shortly thereafter, we reached Shirakawago. From the minute we stepped outside\
  \ the bus, we were greeted by bone-chilling temperature, blizzard-inducing wind,\
  \ but yet for me it is just perfect. Taking picture is a chore, though, as we have\
  \ to remove our gloves, tucked in the umbrella, all of which are while wearing a\
  \ super thick coat. \n\nA short-walk thereafter, every inch is picture perfect.\
  \ A blanket of thick white snow, traditional houses shaped in perfect triangle,\
  \ and those calming sound of cold running water. I remember taking a picture and\
  \ looking at the result I was more than mesmerized. It was certainly look like one\
  \ of those high-end paintings that already won world-wide acclaim. The one picture-esque\
  \ moment that stays with me is the view of a distant mountain perched atop a frozen\
  \ lake, with surrounding white blanket snow so thick you could have sworn you saw\
  \ it on TV with high-end special effects.\n\nAll in all, I could say that sometimes\
  \ clich\xE9 destination can turn up to be one of those treasured moment as long\
  \ as you experienced it the right way. I truly didn't expect to find a moment like\
  \ this during my trip, and was pleasantly surprised."
