Text: "last year i made an exciting travel when i found my self exploring brazil.\
  \ I arrived brazil  to visit a friend and together we traveled to Manaus the boader\
  \ city of Brazil and venezuela...We took of from Sao paulo to Porto Velho by bus..then\
  \ continue with a boat to manaus.\n   Well the experience revealed itself while\
  \ on boat ...when we started going through the Amazon, I noticed Deep in the heart\
  \ of the Amazon Rainforest is one such natural wonder. This is where the waters\
  \ of the Rio Negro and the Amazon River, also known as Rio Solim\xF5es, meet. The\
  \ meeting of the waters is quite a spectacle to behold and it happens in Manaus,\
  \ an Amazon city in Brazil. Here, the sandy colored water of the Amazon River and\
  \ the black water of the Rio Negro (literally translating as black river in English)\
  \ collide.\n\n \n\nYou would expect two rivers that meet to blend in to one another\
  \ but that is not the case here. At the meeting of the rivers, there is a clear\
  \ line that forms between the two waters and it is utterly mesmerising as well as\
  \ fascinating.\n\nI was astonished and i kept gazing at this two rivers with keen\
  \ interest. as we pas by that particular zone slowly. this is one of the most striking\
  \ images nature has ever granted me...well i have seen a lot of surprising things\
  \ naturally but this is heart taking.\n i will love to share some other stuff and\
  \ make them lucrative to myself  and to others...that is why i wan to join this\
  \ programme.\n\nthanks"
