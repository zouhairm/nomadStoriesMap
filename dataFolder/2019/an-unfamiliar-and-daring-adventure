Text: "I was sweating when I hit \u201Cconfirm.\u201D \n\nMy round-trip tickets to\
  \ Costa Rica now officially booked. \n\nAs a journalist, I\u2019ve traveled across\
  \ the United States for work, but for whatever ridiculous reason, traveling alone\
  \ in a foreign place terrified me. Illogical, but true. \n\nAt first, family and\
  \ friends thought I was reckless to go on a \u201Cdaring,\u201D unfamiliar adventure\
  \ by myself. \n\nBut let me also admit this. \n\nI secretly enjoyed telling people\
  \ I was about to jet off to the unknown and uncharted, alone. Although I came across\
  \ as fierce and, well, pretty badass, behind the scenes, I was filled with anxiety.\
  \ The \u201Cforeign\u201D part of \u201Cforeign travel\u201D meant I would see and\
  \ experience what I could not at home, and I didn\u2019t know what to expect. Which\
  \ scared me.\n\nIt\u2019s a quiet Wednesday when I land in San Jose, Costa Rica\u2019\
  s capital city. With no deadlines and really no place to be, it\u2019s a new feeling,\
  \ and I\u2019m freaking out \u2014 a mix of both panic and excitement. \n\nI take\
  \ a joy ride in my rental car before heading to the first hostel. Even with a rough\
  \ itinerary, my calendar is wide open for any inspiration, whims, and delights.\
  \ As I made random left and right turns in the crowded streets, I wonder what\u2019\
  s about to happen. \n\nIt feels good to be free of any responsibilities or expectations\
  \ and it seems without my normal rushing, this is an adventure bound by no time.\
  \ \n\nThe next morning, my small worries from the night before quiet down. \n\n\
  My favorite Tico (Costa Rican) breakfast is chicken-rice, eggs, and beans, called\
  \ Arroz con Pollo. I can barely pronounce it correctly, but servers are sympathetic.\
  \ Strangers are much kinder than many of us are willing to believe.\n\nThe \u201C\
  Pura Vida\u201D lifestyle \u2014 \u201Cpure life\u201D in Spanish \u2014 means there\u2019\
  s no rush. This is one of the first times in my life where I sip, not chug, my coffee.\
  \ And I didn\u2019t know that was possible for me. \n\nEverything slows down when\
  \ you decide to pay attention, and that\u2019s when I notice details I often ignore,\
  \ down to the scent of the Costa Rica coffee, which tastes less bitter than what\
  \ I drink in the states. \n\nI soak and savor every bit, and I wonder how I can\
  \ bring this feeling back home, and how I can teach myself to embrace what I don\u2019\
  t know.\n\nI go to La Fortuna de San Carlos, the spot with one of the most active\
  \ volcanoes. It\u2019s breathtaking. I stop to stare and take photographs.\n\nThe\
  \ next days are spent on calm, clear beaches along the Pacific shore. \n\nI go to\
  \ Flamingo beach, a spot I never researched, but discover after a local restaurant\
  \ owner gives me the recommendation. I\u2019m beginning to find the unplanned thrilling.\
  \ \n\nThe beach is all mine. I get into the ocean, and it feels like the water pulls\
  \ me in, for some sort of healing. Even with the clear waters, the ocean is earth\u2019\
  s unknown. I\u2019m calm. \n\nThe water seemingly washes away much of my grief and\
  \ disappointments from home; those life events happening thousands of miles away.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019ve never swum in an ocean before, but there\u2019s something\
  \ about taking a barely-planned trip that feels so liberating. It\u2019s the freedom\
  \ to enjoy what I did not plan or know.\n\nThere\u2019s something about stepping\
  \ into these vast ocean waters that solidifies even more: I had no idea what I was\
  \ getting myself into, but I\u2019m really here. For all my fears about traveling\
  \ solo, wow. This is truly it. I made it and this is pure, rewarding joy. \n\nIf\
  \ I could repeat my Costa Rica trip a thousand times over, I would. Without any\
  \ hesitation. If I could parachute into any country, without knowing much about\
  \ the destination, I would go now. I learned it was time to just jump and land where\
  \ I may.\n\nI want to use my storytelling and writing to empower other women and\
  \ millennial solo travelers, and I know this is an incredible opportunity to begin.\
  \ The prospect of having such an accomplished travel writer like Tim Neville mentor\
  \ me is an unrivaled opportunity. A little corny, but also true."
