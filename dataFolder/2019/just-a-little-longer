Text: "Sun and shade, blue skies and a stretch of green. It\u2019s hot, but cool enough\
  \ to bare a little of yourself to the heat. I am sitting on a bench in the Plaza\
  \ de Catalunya, where pigeons flutter and crowd the square, pecking at the hundreds\
  \ of crumbs tossed by the old lady sat on my left. They coo, and coo, swarming at\
  \ my feet. I give one lazy kick and they fly away.\n\nWhite people, black people,\
  \ French, Hispanic. Scattered all over the grass, they take selfies in front of\
  \ the fountain. Red and blue buses stand one after the other outside El Corte Ingles,\
  \ the biggest department store here. In line with the banks, hotels and street vendors,\
  \ they wait patiently for their passengers of the day. The music of the water, along\
  \ with the cathedral bells, coaxes me to stay a little longer. \n\nMy friends recommended\
  \ that I visit the Plaza de Catalunya before I left The crossover between old and\
  \ urban, the fusions of languages I cannot understand yet which sound like separate\
  \ melodies, the laughter circling in the air, makes this spot the most pleasant\
  \ to wait in. I watch shadows criss-cross the floor as trainers and flip-flops pace\
  \ to and fro. Two old ladies with their arms linked waltz leisurely, chatting as\
  \ if they are still little girls. Along the horizon of green, families stroll whilst\
  \ their children lick ice-cream from their fingers. Dogs of every kind race across\
  \ the grass to the hiss of Coca cola cans and the spurting of the water fountain.\
  \ They run in and out amidst statues and sculptures, and all the art this place\
  \ dreams. \n\nA rush of wind pulls away at the leaves, as if to haul me from my\
  \ seat. Not just yet, I don\u2019t want to leave.\n\nNow, a child is chasing away\
  \ the pigeons. He is so caught up in the moment that when he turns, he finds his\
  \ mother gone. \u201CMama!\u201D he calls. The face that was full of glee suddenly\
  \ loses its smile. Frantically, he runs towards the trees, forgetting the birds,\
  \ forgetting the joy, forgetting everything temporarily.\n\u201CMama!\u201D he cries.\n\
  A dark figure emerges from the foliage, wearing a backpack and I freeze. But as\
  \ the stranger steps out into the light, the child runs clumsily towards him. The\
  \ father extends his hand and the child takes it immediately. I watch the two walk\
  \ away together, thinking of my own father. There was a time when we too held hands\
  \ like that. \n\nThe \u2018Aerobus\u2019 is just around the corner, and now a black\
  \ woman sits beside me, laughing and clicking her empty Coca Cola can. \"Gracia,\
  \ gracia\" the lady cries into her phone.      \nTwo grandmas on my left are speaking\
  \ in Spanish or Catalan, I cannot tell, only that they speak with rhythm, a music\
  \ that is pleasing to my ears. In front of me, an elderly couple also speak in another\
  \ language. The old man wears a faded cap, pulled up socks and brown polished shoes,\
  \ as if he's still living in the 18th century. \n\nFive days isn\u2019t enough to\
  \ explore this wonderful country. If I were to visit again, I\u2019d come here by\
  \ myself and not as a graduation trip with friends. I want to lose myself like the\
  \ sway of the flamenco dancer I watched in Seville, lost in fire, passion, and love,\
  \ not knowing where life will lead me. \n\nOla Spain, Ola. Who knows, maybe five\
  \ years later I will see you again. You will be like a long lost lover, whose hand\
  \ I briefly touched but never got to hold. By then, maybe I\u2019ll be old enough\
  \ to understand all your artists and appreciate all your works. We\u2019ll maybe\
  \ have a sangria together and tour all the museums in Madrid at a more leisurely\
  \ pace.\n\nTwo grand fountains shooting out white swirls, sending shimmering crystals\
  \ back into the base. I bask in the sunlight filtering through the trees, just a\
  \ little longer. The hands point five-to-three on my watch. I must get up. But I\
  \ don\u2019t want to leave."
