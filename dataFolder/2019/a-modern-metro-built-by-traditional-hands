Text: "When I flew into New plymouth, Taranaki, \non the west coast of New Zealand,\
  \ I came with an empty wallet and a shattered heart. Two items I dont recommend\
  \ for travelling the unkown by yourself, however, always a great motivation to book\
  \ the destination that makes no logical sense Instead of the usual heavy alcohol\
  \ induced \"finding me\" trips away.   \n\nFrom the old rickety steps exiting the\
  \ plane, to the one roomed airport, I quickly realised this was not the big hustle\
  \ cities of Australia I had grown accustomed to over the past 6 years. \n\n While\
  \ driving from the airport with a friend, I saw no monuments, no big museums, no\
  \ jaw dropping historic buildings. It basically consisted of a main high street\
  \ with a couple of cafes and bars littered along. My metropolitan mind took at face\
  \ value New Plymouth as a standard quaint town that had been classed as a city,\
  \ nothing to write home about. \n\nDay 2 wasnt much better, I went to a local  beach\
  \ as my accomodation was a 5 min walk away. Coming from Australia I was spoilt for\
  \ choice for beaches consisting of aqua blues and crystal gold's, so you can imagine\
  \ my disbelief when I found black sand at the beach. Extremely Hot black sand. It\
  \ left me with many questions and burnt feet. Hardly living up to what I discovered\
  \ at a later date is Lonely Planets 2nd most recommended region of 2017 in the world.\
  \ \n\nWhy did I stay? \nEver seen a really bad movie trailer, still watched the\
  \ movie and loved it? Yeah, this was one of those. That and I had no money to book\
  \ a flight home. Feeling like I had nothing to lose I decided to go exploring, not\
  \ only did I find the museums and monuments to my shock, I discover New Plymouth\
  \ city was a beach city, right on the coast. The foreshore walkway they have there\
  \ is one of the most beautiful coastal walkways I ever seen, from rolling corners\
  \ and hills that lead all the way to the thirty shades of green New Zealand is know\
  \ for, with views consisting of breathtaking Mount Tarnaki sights, to turquoise\
  \ waves breaking on rocks and magical sunsets streaking the sky behind a quayside\
  \ over shadowed by 3 imposing ocean mounts that no camera captured memory can every\
  \ truly live up to. The foreshore is your favourite song you keep playing for that\
  \ nostalgic escape, timeless any time of the year. \n\nI discovered, the foreshore\
  \ is just a small snippet of New Plymouth city, the real magic is the Taranaki region.\
  \ When you can snow board down a mountain and lie on a tropical beach that same\
  \ day you know you're in a rare place. And that's it, taranaki is rare, from chasing\
  \ many of the 30ft waterfalls, or doing one of the best 1 day hiking trails along\
  \ the Pouakai crossing that covers rainforests and a magical mountain view, it doesnt\
  \ take long to discover how special this place is. \n\nThe people of the region\
  \ are just as important as the mountain itself,  wether it be from a couple of friendly\
  \ canadians who operate a cafe conveniently named 'Escape'  offering the best  ethically\
  \ sourced coffee in town, that boasts a skate pipe, a yoga retreat and the occasional\
  \ local musician playing all wrapped into one space. All the way to the organizers\
  \ of WOMAD (world of music, arts and dance) festival who do what every Tarnaki local\
  \ does, they use a great idea and make it better. Not only does WOMAD boast local\
  \ musical talent they use the platform to promote new innovation on a greener world.\n\
  \ \n\nTaranaki is your favourite dessert, you always have room for more, wether\
  \ your taking a short break or a long stay, Taranaki has everything you need from\
  \ great food to breathtaking photos, all within an hour or two of the city. The\
  \ best part, almost everything is free to do, a rare gift in a travellers world,\
  \ even if it did cost, you would gladly pay to have a piece what the locals call\
  \ Taradise. It truly is a home for the soul."
