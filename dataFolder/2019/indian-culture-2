Text: "It\u2019s been said that everything in the vastly diverse country of India\
  \ can be taken to its extreme. It\u2019s a country of immense beauty yet utter filth.\
  \ The countryside can seem barren, yet the cities and traffic are the densest on\
  \ earth. The rich have unimaginable wealth and the poor can barely scrape by. Bollywood\
  \ actresses dress seductively yet the country as a whole is extremely socially conservative.\n\
  \nDuring a month-long trip to India, I met many women traveling, with companions\
  \ and in groups. There were those on short but expensive holidays, backpackers and\
  \ volunteers traveling for several months and, of course, those who were working\
  \ for an extended period of time through pre-arranged programs. Most of them were\
  \ respectful of the local customs but some of these women behaved and dressed in\
  \ manners that were insulting and disrespectful to Indians. I believe this disregard\
  \ was due to ignorance rather than any intentional point to defy Indian traditions.\
  \ This lack of awareness, however, not only affects how that individual may be treated\
  \ by the locals, but also how other travelers who follow in their footsteps will\
  \ be treated.\n\nClothing\n\nDressing appropriately will set the tone of how you\
  \ are received by the locals (and potentially other travelers) and will help ensure\
  \ that unwanted attention and advances from men are kept to a minimum. Low cut,\
  \ tight-fitting shirts, tank tops, skirts that fall above the knees, shorts and\
  \ bikinis are highly discouraged. While swimsuits can be worn in beach resort areas\
  \ such as Goa, consider wearing a conservative one-piece and covering yourself with\
  \ a sarong and t-shirt when you\u2019re not sunbathing or when you are interacting\
  \ with locals. Short sleeve cotton shirts can be worn in warmer climates but they\
  \ should be loose fitting and not revealing. Observe the locals and dress a bit\
  \ more conservatively than the most liberally dressed woman.\n\n\n\nGirls in India\n\
  \nFor a bit more traditional clothing, consider buying a salwar kameez. The kameez\
  \ itself is a loose-fitting blouse, often with\nlong sleeves, that comes down past\
  \ the waist or just above the knees. Salwars are loose-fitting pajama-like pants\
  \ that are very wide at the top and very narrow at the ankles. A dupatta (long scarf)\
  \ is often used as an accessory or for covering the head when need be.\n\nSaris\
  \ are worn by all Indian women at one time or another but are rarely worn by Western\
  \ women, except, perhaps, for a special occasion such as a wedding. A sari consists\
  \ of a long length of fabric wrapped elegantly, and without pins, zippers or buttons,\
  \ around the body and over a choli (a short sleeved and often midriff-baring top).\
  \ While a choli may seem revealing to the Western eye because the stomach often\
  \ shows, it should never be worn alone without a sari or other fabric covering it\
  \ up. \n\nSafety\n\n.Your personal safety and the potential theft of your belongings\
  \ will be your two main concerns.\n\nTo prevent sexual harassment, keep your arms\
  \ folded in front of you in large crowds and on public transportation. Gropers will\
  \ test you if given a chance \u2014 don\u2019t offer them an opportunity. It\u2019\
  s best not to initiate conversations that could be construed as flirtatious or personal\
  \ and sidestep answering personal questions about yourself. If you\u2019re traveling\
  \ alone or with a female friend, invent a husband and make it clear that you are\
  \ not interested in anyone else. Avoid situations where you may find yourself alone\
  \ with a man. Connect with other travelers to share a taxi ride or tour and never\
  \ let a man into your hotel room under any circumstance. If you order room service,\
  \ don\u2019t let the door shut behind the bellhop, for instance. Very importantly,\
  \ follow the advice on dressing conservatively.\n\n\nPacking\n\nFor your own safety,\
  \ pack light. Train and bus travel are popular in India and with few bags you\u2019\
  ll be able to move quickly out of potentially nasty situations and you won\u2019\
  t have to keep an eye on too many items while in-transit. \n\n\n\nWomen travelers\
  \ to India will encounter a more sexist attitude from the locals than they might\
  \ in most Western countries. However, by acting and dressing appropriately, the\
  \ journey can be as safe."
