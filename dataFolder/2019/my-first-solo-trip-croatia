Text: "Last summer my time at university came to an end and all of a sudden I was\
  \ dropped into adulthood, something I somehow wasn't ready for. It had been an intense\
  \ few years studying and working in London and for some reason, in such a place\
  \ of uncertainty and instability, I decided it was time to run away and go on a\
  \ solo trip. I have a dangerous habit of diving into things without giving it a\
  \ second thought, but this was my biggest dive yet.\n\nI didn't just go away to\
  \ escape the intensity London life, it was also a personal challenge with my anxiety.\
  \ Travelling alone has always tested my anxiety, so getting a plane and going abroad\
  \ by myself was a big deal. However, I was as excited as I was nervous. My destination\
  \ wasn't too important to me, as long as it was hot, cheap and pretty. One evening\
  \ after watching a very sun-filled episode of Made In Chelsea set in Croatia, I\
  \ had determined the destination of my first solo trip.\n\nI didn\u2019t go away\
  \ expecting to make friends, it actually hadn't even crossed my mind to mingle with\
  \ others. My initial intentions were to explore a new place and challenge myself,\
  \ but it turned out the people I met out there made the trip all the more enlightening.\
  \ I met so many people from across the world in those ten days, and they all opened\
  \ my eyes to how much the world has to offer. I will be forever greatful for what\
  \ I learnt from the people I met.\n\nThe new connections and friendships Croatia\
  \ brought me were a significant part of the trip, however the sights I saw were\
  \ equally as enriching. I made sure not to spend all of my days laying in the sun\
  \ and drinking, as pleasant as that was. I went on my own excursions and had the\
  \ privilidge of witnessing some of the most stunning landscapes in Croatia. I saw\
  \ giant waterfalls and the clearest seas I've ever seen. I walked through palace\
  \ ruins you'd find in Game of Thrones (literally, they shoot a lot of the show in\
  \ Croatia!). I felt like I was in a blissful bubble of sun, sea and fresh air. \n\
  \nEvery day was different and that made every day exciting. A different beach, a\
  \ different hike, new people on every excursion and island. Before I left for Croatia,\
  \ I thought of myself as far less capable than I actually was. Booking those tickets\
  \ was one of the best decisions I ever made. It showed me how much I had underestimated\
  \ my abilities. It gave me confidence, self belief and a whole new perspective on\
  \ life. My trip also gave me a terrible case of the travel bug. The job I returned\
  \ to in London felt unfulfilling. As of the last few months my goal has been to\
  \ save up, travel and write on my wanders. While some may view me quitting my career\
  \ as reckless and lazy, I know that my first solo trip was a kick up the behind\
  \ to actually start a life I'm excited to live."
