Text: "I think it is important to understand how I view the world. Everyone one comes\
  \ from a place they call \u201Chome.\u201D For me, I am a member of the Seneca Nation\
  \ of Indians, which means that I grew up on an Indian reservation located in western\
  \ New York State. I am considered both a citizen of the United States and my tribe\
  \ (approximately 8,000+ members).\n\nI was excited to begin my studies in Bologna,\
  \ Italy through Syracuse University\u2019s \u201CItalian Neorealism and Documentary\
  \ Filmmaking in Bologna\u201D program. As my departure date approached, I was creating\
  \ a pile of things I was going to pack for my trip and I was ordering my required\
  \ textbooks online. Mentally, I was preparing how my studying abroad was going to\
  \ affect me personally. I really didn\u2019t think how my absence at home was going\
  \ to affect others until my family planned a going away picnic for me. Having a\
  \ picnic with your family is one thing, but I have forty-one first cousins so this\
  \ get together was an event. I have traveled abroad a few times before but for my\
  \ family, this time it was different. No one in my large extended family had ever\
  \ studied abroad and very few had even attended college. In my culture, we do not\
  \ have a word for \u201Cgood-bye\u201D so as I was saying my \u201Cuntil next time,\u201D\
  \ my family was less worried about me bringing back souvenirs than expressing their\
  \ desire for me to have fun and return safely. After that picnic, the perspective\
  \ of my studies in Italy shifted. Unlike my prior leisure trips abroad, I felt a\
  \ duty to make my family proud.\n\nA few days before my departure, I felt like a\
  \ part of me was already on my journey to Italy. I\u2019d find my mind preoccupied\
  \ with the future steps required to get me from my home reservation to the University\
  \ of Bologna campus. I\u2019d find myself thinking (and sometimes sharing with my\
  \ parents), \u201CGee, in forty-eight hours, I\u2019ll be on the flight to Italy.\u201D\
  \ Although my statement was stated with a sense of glee and anticipation, I also\
  \ became aware how those words affected my mother. My mum would say \u201CI know\
  \ you are going to have a good time.\u201D Thanks to modern technology, leaving\
  \ home for far away journeys does not need to feel as permanent to the one who leaves\
  \ or for the ones who are left behind. As my train departed the Buffalo-Depew train\
  \ station, I was able to text my mom and dad that I missed them already and I thanked\
  \ them for being there for me.\n\nAs the wheels of my trans-Atlantic plane lifted\
  \ off the ground at JFK airport, I became acutely aware how lonely it felt sitting\
  \ there in seat 10C. Only a few days before, I was surrounded by my parents, brothers,\
  \ aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews. I opened one of my digital devices\
  \ and I browsed through a multitude of images of my life on Seneca territory. In\
  \ a small way, I was already a little homesick. When we travel to far distant lands,\
  \ we usually bring souvenirs or mementos back to help us remember our experiences.\
  \ I realized the images on my phone were in themselves souvenirs from home and they\
  \ were helping me to not forget where I came from.\n\nI arrived at the Bologna University\
  \ campus safely and I checked into my dorm room. For the next five weeks, I was\
  \ going to do as the Bologna students do while I studied and lived within this ancient\
  \ city."
