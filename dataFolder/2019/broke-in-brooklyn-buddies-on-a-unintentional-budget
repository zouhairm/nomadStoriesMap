Text: "One weekend, two Canadians and $300 between us and the best impromptu trip\
  \ of our young, impulsive lives. We were New York City bound to live the lux life\
  \ we deserved, but the true \u201Ctreat yo\u2019 self\u201D moments happened just\
  \ over the bridge.\n\nWe picked out our million dollar outfits and paired our highest\
  \ heels with bus tickets to Penn Station. The ride may not have been drippin\u2019\
  \ with finesse, but that doesn\u2019t mean we weren\u2019t. Plus, the lush life\
  \ would be waiting for us on arrival. With the bright lights and the busy streets,\
  \ we quickly became enthralled with the idea that we were part of something big.\
  \ \n\nStumbling down the coach stairs and fumbling with our wheel luggage, we set\
  \ our sights on the one and only Times Square. The real NYC. The thing that people\
  \ go see when they go to New York. Right? But google maps just didn\u2019t find\
  \ the fastest route. So we started asking the locals, and even the police on duty\
  \ for directions. \u201CJust down there sweetheart\u201D the man in blue declared,\
  \ accompanied by a confident wink and a pointed finger in the direction of an back\
  \ street.\n\nWe met some more locals down there as well, but they were not interested\
  \ in helping us live out our first big NYC moment. In fact, the hindered our process\
  \ to the strongest degree. We were jumped. After showing them our cracked iPhones\
  \ and \u201Clight\u201D luggage of small dresses, they just took all the cash we\
  \ showed in our wallets. \n\nThe men in blue we dealt with afterwards weren\u2019\
  t as eager to help us as the original one. After receiving multipule lectures about\
  \ our questionable route choices (so ironic), we went from feeling so big to embarrassingly\
  \ small. In defeat, we just wanted to wallow in it privately. \n\nThankfully, through\
  \ some knowledge gained when clicking through some travel blogs, we stored some\
  \ money away in our socks and hidden pockets. We scarped together just over $300\
  \ USD.\n\nWe had booked an Airbnb in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn to save us some\
  \ coin, and after the day\u2019s events, a safe space to settle in sounded absolutely\
  \ immaculate. We hopped on train after train until we finally made it to where we\
  \ needed to be. But what we felt in Brooklyn helped us find our original vision\
  \ of the trip.\n\nIn the risk of sounding too clich\xE9, the rich experiences we\
  \ oringinally sought out had little to do with the money lining our pockets. We\
  \ went on a free Street Art walk with the most fabulous and knowledgeable guide.\
  \ We endugled ourselves with bagels and pizza and shawarma and sweets without even\
  \ making a dent in our funds. We hopped from bar to bar meeting locals that knew\
  \ the spots to be, finding Lucky Dog on Bedrock Avenue, a bar that allowed people\
  \ to bring their dogs! So many puppers to pet, and to chase when they ran for the\
  \ door, but we laughed like we were in a live audience for a comedy show (which\
  \ was in the original plans). \n\nWe went for soul food, we got a crash course in\
  \ skateboarding, and we even experiended the magic of the Brooklyn bridge at midnight.\
  \ With cheap convinence store beer and a bundle of new friends, we felt like we\
  \ the special guests at a VIP event. We made sure to sign our names on the metal\
  \ beams to be sure we left our mark. \n\nWhen we did dive into our funds, it was\
  \ well spend in fun vintage and specialty store in Williamsburg. Our budget-friendly\
  \ finds kept our look on point. \n\nWe left without the NYC experience, but that\
  \ didn\u2019t matter. What we did leave with was the feeling of not wanting to leave\
  \ at all, and already planning our next trip to coolest spot we never intended to\
  \ discover. The best part was, we left with a few extra dollars to stock up on the\
  \ delicious treats we found in Brooklyn food scene, which is essential for a long\
  \ bus ride home. \n\nNew York will just have to wait."
