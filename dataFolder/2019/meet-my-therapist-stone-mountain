Text: "I honestly couldn\u2019t tell what was louder, the pounding in my chest or\
  \ the throbbing in my knees. The pain was nothing compared to the heat, though.\
  \ On what was supposed to be a cool September day in Atlanta, Georgia, the sun\u2019\
  s rays hit the top of my head, causing streams of warm sweat to pour down my neck.\
  \ Stone Mountain was proving to be a pain. \n\nJust yesterday, this all seemed like\
  \ an outstanding plan. At my friend Juan\u2019s suggestion, he, our friend Kat,\
  \ and I would hike to the top of Stone Mountain before heading to a well deserved\
  \ brunch. I put my blind faith in Juan, my close friend for over a decade, and didn\u2019\
  t do any of my typical (neurotic) planning and research. If he said this would be\
  \ a fun Saturday morning activity, then it must be. Even a little bit of Googling,\
  \ though, would\u2019ve let me know that Stone Mountain wasn\u2019t just any ordinary\
  \ hike. It was a one mile climb, 1,686 feet above sea level. A steep formation of\
  \ slippery rocks that could render fully-grown, physically fit men useless against\
  \ its treacherous ascent, never mind what it could do to a chubby, 28 year-old woman\
  \ with knee problems.\n\nI cursed myself under my breath. What was I thinking? I\
  \ wasn\u2019t fit! I got winded climbing up a single flight of stairs. My inner\
  \ saboteur was having a field day. Minutes into the trek, I sent Juan and Kat ahead,\
  \ afraid that my constant need to take a break would annoy them. As soon as I could\
  \ no longer make out my friends in the distance, I stopped. Between forced breaths,\
  \ I made my way over to a rock and plopped down, surrendering to the mountain. I\
  \ chugged from my water bottle, the cool liquid shocking my warm cheeks. I was sure\
  \ my face looked like an overripe tomato, bright red and splotchy. \n\nI couldn\u2019\
  t help but to be angry at myself for being so physically unfit, for being unable\
  \ to keep up with my friends, and for giving up so quickly. The parallels between\
  \ my personal shortcomings and this climb were becoming glaringly obvious. I\u2019\
  d always felt like I was a few steps behind all of my peers. I was the last to start\
  \ dating, the last to move out of my parents\u2019 house, and, more recently, the\
  \ last of my friends to get married. The frustration of being the life-long straggler\
  \ boiled inside me. I knew I was only moments away from erupting into tears. I shielded\
  \ my eyes from the sun as I looked up the mountain, curious about how much longer\
  \ I had to go. Ahead of me lie the stunning rock formation in all her glory, sunlight\
  \ beaming across the smooth, white rock. A thought crept in between the self pity\
  \ and doubt.\n\nI can do this.\n\nI put one foot in front of the other and started\
  \ my way back up the mountain. I wasn\u2019t going to break any records getting\
  \ to the summit, but there was no way I was going back home without getting to the\
  \ top. \n\nLooking back, I don\u2019t remember much besides the pain and the sweat.\
  \ I only know that at a certain point I stopped to take a picture of the incredible\
  \ view, a view most people missed because they were too focused on the climb. By\
  \ the end, I was only taking one or two steps between breaks, the entirety of the\
  \ hike catching up with me. When I reached the summit- a flat, slippery surface\
  \ so high up that I felt like I could touch the clouds, I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ feel a mix of accomplishment and sadness. \n\nFor so long, I\u2019d beat myself\
  \ up for being a \u201Clate bloomer,\u201D always a few steps behind everyone else.\
  \ What I\u2019d failed to realize was that life was handing me an incredible opportunity:\
  \ A chance to take life slowly and enjoy the view. When I started climbing Stone\
  \ Mountain that morning, the last thing I thought I would find was the ability to\
  \ be patient with myself. Who knew mountain climbing could be so therapeutic? And\
  \ so hard on the knees..."
