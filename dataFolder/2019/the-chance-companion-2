Text: "\u201CHey! We will start at 5.30 am\u201D texted Carmel. I had put up at Cherrapunji,\
  \ Meghalaya to visit the \u2018live root double decker bridge\u2019 in Nongriat.\
  \ The hotel manager told me that his son can accompany me, while also mentioning\
  \ \u201CThough, I don\u2019t think you will need a guide.\u201D\n\nCarmel arrived\
  \ at the decided time. I hopped onto his car as he explained gleefully while trying\
  \ to seem apologetic \u201CWe are starting early to avoid the usual humdrum of tourists\
  \ that start pouring in, as the day progresses; dad said you liked solitude\u201D\
  . Well! Solitude! Belonging to the creed of \u2018White Collars\u2019, solitude\
  \ was a luxury to me. That\u2019s what drew me to the state of Meghalaya, meaning\
  \ \u2018Abode of Clouds\u2019. Meghalaya definitely kept true to its name, be it\
  \ roads, meadows, jungles, towns, water bodies, you will always be accompanied by\
  \ the clouds. My clouds of thoughts were cleared soon, by Carmel calling out enthusiastically\
  \ to someone, in his sing song voice and language. \u201CHe is Joshua, he cooks\
  \ really well, I can ask him to treat you to a Meghalayan gourmet meal, once we\
  \ are back\u201D As we drove through the meandering cloud filled roads of Cherrapunji,\
  \ he would wave at few early risers and brief me about them. Within 30 minutes I\
  \ knew that a 3 year old \u2018Joy\u2019 was born to her parents after much deliberation;\
  \ people in Meghalaya are passionate about football; a cement factory was established\
  \ in Cherrapunji to provide employment. Carmel was telling me about the Sacred Groves\
  \ when we reached the start point of our small trek. \n\nTo reach the live root\
  \ bridge, you have to climb down approximately 3,500 unruly steps covered with moss;\
  \ and two rickety bridges made out of wire mesh. Merely, 100 steps later I realised,\
  \ it\u2019s not as easy as it seems and that\u2019s when I also discovered that\
  \ Carmel can sing and that too, melodiously. I started concentrating on his classic\
  \ pop rather than the plunging drop that I may succumb to, if my footwork goes wrong.\
  \ The path was dotted by homestays and food shacks, which were all closed at this\
  \ hour.\n\nHe was humming \u2018Quit Playing Games with My Heart\u2019, when we\
  \ reached the first wire mesh bridge. One step on it and it oscillated. Looking\
  \ at my scared demeanour Carmel laughed. \u201CDon\u2019t worry its fun\u201D, he\
  \ said performing a little jig. I had no other option than to believe him. Few steps\
  \ later, we were dancing away to glory while crossing the bridge. Once relieved\
  \ of the fear I was dumbstruck with the beauty around. Clear turquoise water flowing\
  \ underneath; lush green set up; melodious Carmel intercepted by even more melodious\
  \ birds called Mynahs; it was blissfully satisfying. \n\nWe then reached a denser\
  \ patch of wilderness, which Carmel bowed to and described as the \u2018Sacred Groves\u2019\
  . People consider it holy and visit often to pray. Soon enough, we reached the live\
  \ root bridge, which was weaved out of the roots of living trees. The bridge is\
  \ approximately 150 years old, made by the local indigenous tribes over the waterfall,\
  \ which pooled into a clear blue lake. I took some moments to myself, absorbing\
  \ the quietness around and the sound of the ecosystem. The clear blue water seemed\
  \ inviting. \u201CFancy a plunge? Go ahead!\u201D poked Carmel. With that plunge,\
  \ I again found my momentary bliss.\n \n\nAll done and dusted, it was time to climb\
  \ up those steps. I was craving for a bowl of hot noodles. Carmel said \u201CAre\
  \ you too hungry? If you can manage for a little while, we can eat at the shack\
  \ a bit up ahead.\u201D \u201CShe is an old lady who supports her grand daughter\u201D\
  \ he answered my quizzical look immediately. \n\n\n\nI smiled to myself. The path\
  \ was easy to follow; I didn\u2019t need a guide after all. Carmel wasn\u2019t a\
  \ guide. Was he? He was a local friend, who helped me know more than was conventionally\
  \ possible. With satisfied appetite and a nightingale friend, I was prepared for\
  \ the tiring ascends.\n\n\n\u201CHow was it?\u201D asked Joshua while serving us\
  \ the dinner. \u201CIt was\u2026 blissful\u201D I mentioned thoughtfully. Carmel\
  \ Laughed and said \u201CYou are a blissful mad.\u201D"
