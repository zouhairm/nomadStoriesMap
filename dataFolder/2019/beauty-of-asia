Text: "I visited Malaysia in 2017, I didn't expect to find great things there because\
  \ I am from Indonesia. Malaysia and other South East Asia countries are likely the\
  \ same.  So why did I visit Malaysia then? It is funny because I just went to Singapore\
  \ in 2015 and I want to go to other countries that are not too much spent money,\
  \ so I chose Malaysia and one more important thing that my passport will be expired\
  \ in 2018, cliche.\n\nWhere is Malaysia? Let ask Wikipedia\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia\n\
  \n Malaysia is a country in Southeast Asia. The federal constitutional monarchy\
  \ consists of 13 states and three federal territories, separated by the South China\
  \ Sea into two similarly sized regions, Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia (Malaysian\
  \ Borneo). Peninsular Malaysia shares land and a maritime border with Thailand in\
  \ the north and maritime borders with Singapore in the south, Vietnam in the northeast,\
  \ and Indonesia in the west. East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with\
  \ Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam. Kuala\
  \ Lumpur is the national capital and largest city while Putrajaya is the seat of\
  \ federal government. With a population of over 30 million, Malaysia is the world's\
  \ 44th most populous country. The southernmost point of continental Eurasia, Tanjung\
  \ Piai, is in Malaysia. In the tropics, Malaysia is one diverse countries.\n\nSo\
  \ that day I took Lion Air from Cengkareng Jakarta Indonesia to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.\
  \ Well I just like Ok, feel nothing. At first, when I chose Singapore, I don't want\
  \ to go to Malaysia because, yeah you know, we share the same language and food,\
  \ so what can you expect? But what is the result, oh I love Malaysia. Because it's\
  \ cheap of course compare to Singapore.\n\nDay 1, I arrived at noon, we gathered\
  \ at the airport and took the bus to the hotel, the name of the hotel is YYHOTEL88,\
  \ it was quite a long journey probably more that one hour. So boring, I only saw\
  \ palm trees here and there. With some funny language in the banner, I have seen.\
  \ Why it was funny? Even we share the same language, some of the words are different\
  \ meaningly.\n\nFinally, we arrived at the hotel, quite nice. Last time when I went\
  \ to Singapore, I have to sleep in the bunkbed share with three other girls. Now\
  \ I can sleep in a small hotel but nice and clean. The first place we went to City\
  \ Gallery and Medan Merdeka, well it is like City Hall, and there is a museum. \n\
  City gallery is strategically located in the middle of Kuala Lumpur city, the museum\
  \ tells the story of the city through photos and miniature, it was awesome.\n\n\
  I google it and found this http://www.klia2.info/trips/malaysia/kuala-lumpur-city-gallery:\n\
  The Dataran Merdeka enclave houses many historical buildings, structures and icons\
  \ that date back to more than a century, namely Sultan Abdul Samad Building, Government\
  \ Office, National Textiles Museum, Former National History Museum, KL City Library,\
  \ and others.\n\nIt was quite nice and also I took a photo there. After that we\
  \ went to China Town shopping for sure, at first I did not want to buy anything\
  \ but gosh I remembered my daughter and saw Upin Ipin dolls laugh out the laugh,\
  \ it is 20 Ringgit each but I bargained for two so it was 30 RM. Yeay so happy,\
  \ an then I also bought key chain just for my aunt.\n\nThe second day, I went to\
  \ Batu Cave, at first I did not want to take a hundred stairs, but I do not know\
  \ when I will go there again, so yeah, and you know what I used wedges sandals not\
  \ shoes but thank God my foot did just fine. It was great because very traditional\
  \ and religious, there are a lot of India people there. \n\nNext was shopping in\
  \ Central Market, oh my gosh so cheap. I was strolling around at Pavillion Mall\
  \ in Bukit Bintang. The last pit was the famous Petronas Tower. I was so tired.\n\
  \nIt was so bad the third day, I was directly to the airport because we had morning\
  \ flight, but Malaysia I will see you again for sure."
