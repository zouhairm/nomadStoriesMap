Text: "Marlborough has long had a reputation for Sauvignon Blanc. These New Zealand\
  \ whites were fresh, fruity and quite frankly\u2026 simple. When presented with\
  \ the chance to visit the region; I was excited to go see why these $7 wines were\
  \ building a name for themselves on the world stage.\nEquipped with a lot of ambiguity\
  \ and a large jacket, I booked my flight to the chilly New Zealand; not knowing\
  \ what to expect.\nThe distinct lack of city lights was the only visual cue I had\
  \ to go off as I hopped off the boat on the South Island of New Zealand. Arriving\
  \ late at night, I drove through a quiet dark town and crawled into a farmer\u2019\
  s truck which had been converted into a quaint mini cabin. \nIn the morning, I set\
  \ off through a misty cloud. As I was pondering my amazement at how I still hadn\u2019\
  t seen any of New Zealand yet, the rolling fogs started to lift, revealing an unbelievable\
  \ mountainous background that overshadowed the vineyards below.\nUpon reaching the\
  \ front gates of my friend\u2019s winery, there was a large number of confused heads\
  \ that started to turn in my direction. I had arrived right in the middle of harvest\
  \ and everyone on the vineyard was there to work\u2026except for me.\nThe next 2\
  \ hours involved a personal tour of the vineyards, winery, bottling lines and even\
  \ a ride on the machine harvester. With each passing minute, my naivety became more\
  \ apparent as my friend patiently explained the process of making this simple $7\
  \ wine.\nStraight from the vineyard, the stress was already apparent; it had rained\
  \ too much over the last week and the grapes were too swollen with water to pick.\
  \ However if they waited too long, the onset of the autumn would mean the grapes\
  \ would over-ripen. A call had to be made that day if they proceeded, dozens of\
  \ pickers would be expected to show up within an hour.\nAs we wandered into the\
  \ winery section, the hard-hitting decisions only continued. The previously harvested\
  \ grapes were now fermenting into alcohol but the natural yeast wasn\u2019t eating\
  \ the sugars fast enough; if fermentation took too long here, they would have nowhere\
  \ to store the next. Speeding up fermentation could involve adding external yeast\
  \ or raising the temperature, but doing that would change the classic flavours of\
  \ tropical fruits and citrus in Marlborough Sauv Blanc which the world had grown\
  \ to love.\nAs we proceeded into the chemistry lab, there were 20 beakers filled\
  \ with different batches that had to be blended together into over 200 different\
  \ combinations to get the right flavours and style for harvest this year. While\
  \ blending, the winemakers had to measure sugar, monitor alcohol, speed up fermentation\
  \ and lower acid; all while keeping an eye on the next batch that was coming in.\n\
  Suddenly, Jeremy\u2019s 3am starts and sleeping on the winery floor didn\u2019t\
  \ seem like such a far stretch anymore. How anybody manages to juggle so many moving\
  \ parts was beyond me. \nAnd to think, all of this for something most people take\
  \ for granted for less than $10. Although it seems obvious, I never thought about\
  \ wine as an agricultural practise. If the vineyard runs out of grapes, that\u2019\
  s it, there isn\u2019t an unlimited supply to meet people\u2019s growing demands\
  \ of this wine. \nFor such a simple end product that I had never given more thought\
  \ to other than the appeal of the label, I had discovered such a complex process\
  \ that involved weeks of sleepless nights, teams of growers, pickers, winemakers\
  \ and bottlers. \nWhen I questioned whether or not it was worth it, Jeremy\u2019\
  s response, just like the wine was one simple yet beautiful, \u201Cthere is no effort\
  \ too great when it comes to bringing people joy, and I\u2019m glad people get to\
  \ enjoy my wine.\u201D\nTaking this sentiment with me, I wanted to share not only\
  \ Jeremy\u2019s story, but also the story of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Worth\
  \ so much more than $7, this understated beauty has been unfairly oversimplified.\
  \  Time has moved on since the basic Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc and this region\
  \ & process has developed in breadth and diversity and warrants another glance."
