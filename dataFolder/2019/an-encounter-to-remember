Text: "#HappensWithAllOfUs!!! \n\nI walked into a hotel and after going through the\
  \ menu, I ordered some food. After about 20mins a group of guys and ladies walked\
  \ in & ordered theirs. To my dismay, these folks got served first. I watched as\
  \ they began to eat & laugh heartily. I even overheard one of them bragging about\
  \ how he's connected to everyone in the hotel and I felt mocked. I decided to leave.\
  \ Unable to take it anymore, I called the waiter. He calmly told me : \" yours is\
  \ a special order, being prepared by the chief chef himself. Their orders were prepared\
  \ hurriedly by students on attachment because the top chefs are busy with yours.\
  \ That's why they were served first. Please have some juice as you wait\". I calmed\
  \ down & waited patiently.\nShortly after, my meal was served by 6 waiters. Unknown\
  \ to me, the owner of the hotel (who happened to be an old long lost friend of mine)\
  \ saw me when I entered and decided to surprise me. She changed my simple meal to\
  \ a five-star meal. The party at the other table were shocked. They couldn't stop\
  \ staring . Suddenly they were the ones murmuring, asking why they didn't get that\
  \ kind of service and meal. \nSuch is life ! Some people are ahead of you and are\
  \ eating now, laughing at you and talking about how they are smarter, wiser and\
  \ better than you, how they are well connected , blessed, have money and are enjoying\
  \ life. You are waiting tirelessly wondering why its taking so long to breakthrough,\
  \ You endure mockery and humiliation. May be you've contemplated suicide, gone through\
  \ depression or suffered severe mental anxiety. Don't you worry ! The owner of the\
  \ world has seen you & doesn't want you to be served a simple meal like those making\
  \ a mockery of you.\nYou're waiting long because yours is a special meal. It takes\
  \ time to prepare. And only chief chefs prepare them. \nWait for your meal and relax.\
  \ When it comes that laughing party will be silenced for good. I didn't expect to\
  \ find myself in this way ,my perception changed and I was thanking to be chosen\
  \ to travel and experience this of becoming the new ME again!\nStay blessed enjoy\
  \ your day ! This is my word of encouragement to you today.\n\u270D\uFE0F"
