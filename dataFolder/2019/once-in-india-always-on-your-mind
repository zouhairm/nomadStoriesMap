Text: "India! You have no idea what to expect from this country! \nOr I had no idea!\n\
  \nIndia is the country I saw the most corolful sunrise in my life! Traveling from\
  \ Delhi to Surat with a 6 am flight I couldn\u2019t even imagine that I\u2019ll\
  \ come across with something breathtaking as that sunrise. The combination of the\
  \ colors the transition from one to another to reach black from yellow and meet\
  \ the two brightest stars on the top of the night sky was something I will never\
  \ forget!\nIndia is known for his hospitality!\nGuests are gods for every Indian\
  \ home and they make you feel like that!\nThey will make the best food, the best\
  \ dessert and if you have no idea of the culture they will explain you and make\
  \ you feel part of it!\nIndia is poor in money but rich in heart!\nPeople have significant\
  \ less than more other nations but they can offer you all they have with no regret!\n\
  They will open their houses and welcome you as you are their most important men\
  \ in this world!\nHere, is a trip back to time! Back in 1940s!\nWhen British left\
  \ the country, they took everything with them and they left a broken nation which\
  \ 70 year now tries to rebuild! But British couldn\u2019t can take with them the\
  \ colors, the flowers, the smells, the beauty of this country!\nIndia is a dream!\
  \ India is place that in able to change ones mind and make her feel small in order\
  \ to reach your better self! \n Although its beauty and culture is also a developing\
  \ country with poor people!\nThis is a life lesson that India offers and make you\
  \ thankful for your life!"
