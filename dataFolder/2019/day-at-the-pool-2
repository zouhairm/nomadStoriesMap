Text: "Twenty clicks East of Arusha under the shadow of Mount Meru, lies an unremarkable\
  \ hotel. Seated beside the pool a man is dining alone. Up in my room, I was still\
  \ trying to get out of bed.\n\nI peered the sun lounges with a sense of relaxation;\
  \ they beckoned me downstairs. Before I laid out my towel, a fifty-something man\
  \ with eager eyes motioned for me to join him. \u201CAmerican?\u201D he queried,\
  \ with a wry grin that made me nervous. \u201CNo, Australian\u201D I corrected,\
  \ having acquiesced to his invitation. \n\nNasser told me he\u2019s from Arusha\
  \ but lives in Oman now. He comes back to be close to his roots. Waiving a waiter\
  \ over he ordered something in Swahili. Nasser asked if I wanted anything to drink.\
  \ Having delayed my dip, I requested coffee. Darting back, the waiter placed a large\
  \ glass in front of him containing a clear, syrupy liquid filled halfway. They were\
  \ out of coffee. Downing his drink in two strained gulps, \u201CI have some at my\
  \ house, it\u2019s not far.\u201D\n\nAs we slid on the gravel of the hotel driveway\
  \ he asked with a stony glare, what I was doing in the area. I said I was there\
  \ to fundraise and prepare a local school before classes start. A volley of questions\
  \ followed; I couldn\u2019t tell whether I was being interrogated or if he was genuinely\
  \ interested.\n\nWe broke suddenly. A lady came out of a wooden shack nestled in\
  \ the shade of a yellow Arcadia tree and passed Nasser a bottle in a brown paper\
  \ bag. The only time that bottle wasn\u2019t fixed to his mouth was when he was\
  \ waving and honking at people at the roadside: \u2018Jambo!\u2019 and \u2018Mambo\
  \ Vipi?\u2019 with obsessive regularity. Some ignored us, others gave a stunned\
  \ wave as we went by. \u201CThey love me you know, but at first they didn\u2019\
  t respect me.\u201D\n\nThe road was getting steep now and I could see beyond the\
  \ banana trees in the fields below us. Driving through a rusty gate we arrived to\
  \ a silent house. Through the darkness, I could make out spartan rooms with open\
  \ wiring that came off a central hallway. I was led onto a balcony with a view of\
  \ the valley below. There was a lot of jungle around. \n\nA bird-like man approached\
  \ from the shadows, with a whisper he asked if I wanted something to drink. Stunned\
  \ by his abrupt appearance, Nasser had to fill in the blanks for me, \u201CAbdul,\
  \ this is why I have brought this young man here.\u201D Abdul works for the Omani,\
  \ they share a common heritage and religion. We sat on the balcony sipping our coffees,\
  \ both of them had wide grins. \n\nAbdul told me how his first wife had left him\
  \ but he had met a girl from the village and they were to be married tomorrow. His\
  \ eyes looked on forlornly, \u201C...but we must keep it a secret, only we know.\
  \ She\u2019s Christian.\u201D Her mother would not sanction the conversion. The\
  \ two men spoke rapidly in Arabic as my head started to throb.\n\nNow in on their\
  \ little secret they encouraged me to attend. I had said to myself before embarking\
  \ on this trip that I would greet such a high honour with emphatic positivity. But\
  \ when it did come, it didn\u2019t feel right.\n\nWe left the compound in a blur\
  \ of movement, I was uncertain of our destination. Turning onto the main road, gaining\
  \ speed we shot past the hotel. Everything seemed to speed up. My heart a beating\
  \ lump inside my throat. It felt like this moment had been coming for a while, but\
  \ I had refused to admit it.\n\nWe slowed and pulled up alongside a bank machine.\
  \ The two men motioned for me to get out of the car. I reluctantly stepped out into\
  \ the glaring African sun. \n\nNasser withdrew a large sum of money and placed the\
  \ notes into my sweaty palm, \u201CThis is better off with you than it is with me.\u201D\
  \ I raised my heavy head to meet his gaze, seeing kindness in his eyes for the first\
  \ time but not the last, \u201CCan you show us the school?\u201D"
