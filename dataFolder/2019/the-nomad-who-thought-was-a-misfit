Text: "Most people when hearing the word \u201Chomeland\u201D think of a place where\
  \ the country\u2019s official language is their native language and everyone has\
  \ the same history and habits, which were passed down from their ancestors. Although\
  \ this sounds wonderful, I don\u2019t belong to this group. Quoting the bad break-up\
  \ club: \u201CIt just wasn\u2019t meant to be\u201D.\nSo when I got a chance, my\
  \ first chance to visit a foreign country, my mother tongue's home, I didn\u2019\
  t hesitate. However, at that moment a certain fear started to deepen its roots in\
  \ my soul.\nAfter many hours of riding the bus, we finally arrived at the border.\
  \ It was already dark outside, we were asked to stand in a line in the shadowy alley.\
  \ For some reason, it was a familiar surrounding, but still, even the stone tiles\
  \ on the floor seemed different. And off the road, we were again.\nAll these years\
  \ I was used to high mountains, huge stone pieces which were around me to ensure\
  \ a certain feeling of safeness, however, Hungary wasn\u2019t offering me that,\
  \ instead it brought up in me many unanswered questions about myself and my heritage.\
  \ At that point, I was pretty convinced that I was a misfit in my own homeland and\
  \ also in the country from where the language I speak on a daily basis originates.\
  \ Little did I know that I was going to find my inner peace on the side of a road,\
  \ in a huge round building.\n \xD3pusztaszer National Heritage Park is the home\
  \ of this building. At our arrival, the cold air hit us right in the face as we\
  \ stepped off the bus. From the outside, everything seemed abandoned, but ultra\
  \ modern as well, as if it was the future some post-apocalyptic movies would show.\
  \ After the fence was rolled away we finally were able to enter. Most of us were\
  \ taken aback from the amount of history and treasure this building could contain.\n\
  As we slowly walked up to it in circular motion darkness surrounded us and a wave\
  \ of excitement swept over everyone. No one was sure about, what were we going to\
  \ see. But when I got my first glimpse of the Arrival of the Hungarians, a circular\
  \ panoramic painting by \xC1rp\xE1d Feszty the fear I felt at my departure from\
  \ home vanished. Right there and then I found inner peace and the most honest astonishment\
  \ I could ever feel. The way the Huns were depicted needed no words to be explained,\
  \ it was the circular motion of life repeating itself over and over again, always\
  \ bringing something new to the observer. If that wasn\u2019t enough to take us\
  \ back in time the background music put the cherry on the top. Screaming women,\
  \ birds flying and the rustle of leaves as the Huns stepped on them at their arrival\
  \ brought to life the whole painting. If anyone would close their eyes for a  moment,\
  \ they could clearly see that piece of history in their mind and even experience\
  \ it in the most realistic way. \nThat was the peak point of my own journey in finding\
  \ out whether I belong to a specific place or not. My roots have grown all over\
  \ the world, I was not a child of a country but the child of the world. Just like\
  \ my ancestors, who were nomads I am one of them too, meaning I have several homes,\
  \ each letting me visit another or come back to them when I wish or feel the need\
  \ too.\nMaybe the greatest wonder the yurt-shaped building had hidden away was the\
  \ painting and the feeling of amazement after making me realize that no one belongs\
  \ to only one place and that even a bench next to a painting can feel like home."
