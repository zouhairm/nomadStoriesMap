Text: "She felt alone. Although her life was typical with no hesitation, she was looking\
  \ for more. Between an unknown time, her boss asked her to prepare a course for\
  \ young people that live in poverty. As an expert in social economy, she thought\
  \ she could teach the community how to build a future with solidarity; however,\
  \ that was just not going to happen, the extreme violence in where those people\
  \ lived make her realized that they didn't need a social economy for a change, they\
  \ need hope and that is built with organization and strategy. \nShe came back to\
  \ Mexico City, her place of residence, and she wrote about Jose's wife, who had\
  \ died giving birth to her daughter in unhealthy circumstances. He had to pay around\
  \ 500 dollars to the narcos, so he could drive her wife to a hospital, he can't\
  \ called any ambulance or police because the narcos take control off the high way\
  \ and who ever tried to cross without the authorization of this crime organization,\
  \ was shot and murder. Jose didn\xB4t have the money, he made 300 dollars a month\
  \ and the illegal taxes that the narcos implied was too much for him. He took his\
  \ wife in arms, and he walked between the woods, avoiding to be seen by the criminals.\
  \ They lost and in the middle of the dark his wife started to bleed until she was\
  \ dry. \nThat story made her feel so terrible, and she started to write and write,\
  \ until other people around the world could see through her eyes the inhuman situation\
  \ that happen in Mexico. Only in that way, she thought, hope will be built by the\
  \ solidarity of the world. The help this community needs is the one that make its\
  \ stories visible, that the government turn its head for the poor and not for the\
  \ ones with money. Most of this violence initiate with an unjustified militarization\
  \ that protects companies and leave by their own to people like Jose. \nShe finished\
  \ her writing saying: \u201CIt is needed that with this story and reflection we\
  \ could make visible the invisible situations\u201D. And who is she, you might ask,\
  \ it is me, the one who travel for helping to the cause of others."
