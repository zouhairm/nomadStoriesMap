Text: "As we drive through sparse brown flat land, in the extreme summer heat, the\
  \ desert is quiet and stark. We haven\u2019t seen a car for hours. It\u2019s intimidating\
  \ at first. The sun has scorched the landscape, and feels as though it could do\
  \ the same to us. We\u2019ve grown used to it however, and instead focus on every\
  \ curve and crook of the dusty canyons on the horizon. This has been our panoramic\
  \ view for miles, apart from the occasional camel gently padding through the sand,\
  \ and blinking curiously as we stop to take pictures. We\u2019re almost at our destination.\
  \ \n\nAs we draw closer I\u2019m animatedly sharing my sheer joy at seeing flamingos\
  \ at the bird sanctuary we're heading too. I mean why wouldn't I, with their majestic,\
  \ brilliant bodies of vivid pinks and flame colours. I\u2019m ready to see the desert\
  \ transformed into a sea of hot pink. I wanted to see flamingos more than Jordan\u2019\
  s great ancient cities of Jerash or Petra, the unlimited stars at Wadi Rum desert,\
  \ or bob weightlessly in the Dead Sea.\n\n\u201CDid you know flamingos get their\
  \ rosy pink colour from the food they eat?\u201D I said, as we heard an almighty\
  \ 'pop\u2019. A flat tyre, which rumbles and flaps along the road as we approach\
  \ the Jordanian/Israeli border.  We're in an unknown country, far from a town or\
  \ city, and no knowledge between us of how to change a flat tyre.\n\nWe arrive at\
  \ border control. Military men with military guns surround us. One takes our passports\
  \ and disappears out of sight. The others - four of them - stay to point, laugh,\
  \ and kick the flat tyre. They speak to us in Jordanian Arabic. \u2018Marhaba\u2019\
  \ and the few other words we'd learned weren\u2019t really going to help in this\
  \ situation. So, we took their lead with laughter, and followed it with some emoji\
  \ style shrugs. What else could we do? \n\nAbruptly the \u2018conversation\u2019\
  \ is ended. \nThere's shouting. Soldiers moving around.\nDisappearing out of sight,\
  \ and then silence.\nJordan is known as a safe haven surrounded by a region of conflict,\
  \ but I can't say I wasn't nervous as we sat at that border, wondering what next.\
  \ I was, and I was annoyed too. I only wanted to go to a bird sanctuary, instead\
  \ I felt like we were about to approach a very different experience.\n\nSound appeared\
  \ again. The sound of soldiers, talking and laughing, welding a car jack and swirling\
  \ spare tyres. Bringing with them cups of Bedouin tea too. \n\nBedouin tea is a\
  \ must try assault on the senses, with its rich spicy flavours of wild sage, cardamom,\
  \ cinnamon and heaps of sugar. It's simply delicious. We're ushered out of the car\
  \ and onto the sunny side of the road. While one of the soldiers changes our tyre,\
  \ we sit with the others, on big plump pillows of purples and reds, oranges and\
  \ pinks, greens and blues. They'd been hastily thrown on the dusty ground for us\
  \ to sit on and drink tea and chat. We also take selfies together, and make friends\
  \ on social media. A different experience indeed.\n\nFor a short moment, time slowed\
  \ down. They stopped being soldiers, we stopped being tourists. We were just a group\
  \ of people drinking tea on a curbside in blazing heat.\n\n15 minutes later, our\
  \ tyre's replaced. We\u2019re handed back our passports and being waved away.\n\n\
  I suspected when I shared this story back home it wouldn't be the vivid colour of\
  \ the flamingos that I'd talk about, in fact it definitely wouldn't be. It would\
  \ be the connections with the people who enrich Jordan more than any colour or tourist\
  \ attraction. From the Jordanian man, to the Palestinian woman, the Bedouin tribe,\
  \ and certainly those soldiers. Ironically, dressed in camouflage to blend into\
  \ their surroundings. They didn\u2019t blend in at all. They stood out more than\
  \ any hot pink flamingo."
