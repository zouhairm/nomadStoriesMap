Text: "SEEING THE UNSEEN\n\nI think, a change in my career would have walked me into\
  \ an entirely different life. I always thought of living somebody else\u2019s life.\
  \ There is a journalist sitting in front of me reading a political novel that I\
  \ have never heard of. I wondered about the words that came out of his pen. The\
  \ drop of ink on his table that later smeared on the sides of his hands. His unawareness\
  \ of the rest of the world when he wrote about the political agendas that drove\
  \ him. Maybe there was no passion. But I would like to think that the light of a\
  \ few words that he came across while reading a random book might have done the\
  \ trick. I looked at him when I was describing him in my journal. He noticed me\
  \ at times and it soon turned into a conversation .He was my co-traveller on my\
  \ return journey from Ahmadabad. I was on my way back after a few building visits\
  \ and I was reminiscing over images of them in my head as my career choice was to\
  \ become an architect.\n\nI sketched at every corners of my journal as I wrote.\
  \ There were sketches of mountains that I saw halfway next to their description.\
  \ The mountains on my right side were tall enough to split the Earth into two. My\
  \ side and the other. It looked like the back of a woman\u2019s body turned towards\
  \ the other side. She was looking the other part of the Earth that she was guarding.\
  \ All I could see were the trees that appeared like tiny hairs over her body. They\
  \ lined her sharp edges and her imperfect body looked absolutely beautiful with\
  \ all those hairs. I didn\u2019t pay attention to the rest of the train. Every now\
  \ and then my eyes would get stuck at the book he was reading. The red font in the\
  \ blue book and all the thoughts that I had decided to acknowledge at that very\
  \ moment.\n\nA lot of tunnels  on the way interrupted my writing. Darkness of the\
  \ tunnel demanded my attention just like my pen. I closed my eyes and listened for\
  \ ink screams. A lot of images appeared in my head. I thought of the places I went\
  \ .I remembered myself touching different buildings ,brushing my hands against them\
  \ trying to feel their texture, putting my finger in between joints. I remember\
  \ sitting under  a Banyan tree in the middle of the city, feeding the squirrels\
  \ and thinking about taking them home with me. There were images of the sky ,crimson\
  \ red, pale blue peeping through the buildings. This train journey can keep me stuck\
  \ in time. I wanted a transition where I am neither here nor there. Where nobody\
  \ knows me and none of my decisions can take hold of me. I am in the between and\
  \ I loved the tunnels for this. It didn\u2019t take me much time to realize that\
  \ the tunnels would lead me to the light .\n\nI remembered the beautiful early mornings,\
  \ people opening their shops, reading on the walkways, drinking tea at corners.\
  \ The night walks were along the busy streets following the smell of food and walking\
  \ past arguments between customers and sellers. There were different types of tea\
  \ that I enjoyed; especially \u201CTandoori chai\u201D which was poured into a clay\
  \ tumbler right after heating it in a furnace. There were other images of me stepping\
  \ into courtyard of craft families in a remote village . One such courtyard had\
  \ a lot of colors stacked in pots and few were spilled in the process of making\
  \ craft works. I remember touching these colors with my bare feet and walking on\
  \ the road making foot impressions. I loved the yellow stuck on my feet and I looked\
  \ back at them for one last time.\n\nI am going to hold these images close and write\
  \ about them in an attempt to not forget any details. My favorite of these memories\
  \ would be seeing one particular building that made me feel beautiful inside.\n\n\
  IIM, by Louis khan. All the books in the world cannot grant you the beauty of it.\
  \ The huge scale of it, massive walls that covered me, the trees that outlined those\
  \ buildings, the laid beauty of the bricks, their smell when you walked close and\
  \ the sight of all the animals in harmony with the built form. He made the most\
  \ lifeless  things speak for themselves. Light was God, openings  gave you parts\
  \ of him and shrunk you into an innocent child. If that is not what architecture\
  \ does to you. I don\u2019t know what does. I reached home and asked for my mom\u2019\
  s tea. The most favorite tea of mine."
