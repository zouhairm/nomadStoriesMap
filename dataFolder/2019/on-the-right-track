Text: "Feeling uncomfortable in the comfort of her own place, Elena was determined\
  \ to put an end to this unpleasant feeling of having everything but nothing at the\
  \ same time. Same routine, same work, same people\u2026 same impression: \u201C\
  emptiness\u201D. There was something somewhere waiting for her and she was committed\
  \ to find it\u2026one way or another\u2026 somewhere...\nIt took her some time to\
  \ realize which path to follow. However, it seemed that the Universe, God, Buddha,\
  \ Supernatural Beings or whoever she believed in at that moment was showing her\
  \ way to the unknown. She started feeling something unusual what happened when one\
  \ of her best friends asked her for advice and help in filling some forms to move\
  \ to another country, when that gentle Dutch tourist lost in her small town asked\
  \ her for a place to stay and things to see and to do in the city. She also received\
  \ a proposal to act as an interpreter for a group of Chinese tourists.\nShe didn\u2019\
  t even know why she had studied English before. She became a translator when she\
  \ was not very good at languages and when she only dreamed of being a dancer, an\
  \ actress, an artist instead. Somehow, fate had something up its sleeve. She had\
  \ acquired some skills that eventually would help her to immerse in a different\
  \ culture, in a different world, to see the life from a different perspective, to\
  \ understand how valuable time was\u2026 \nSeveral months went by, and her decision\
  \ to travel to the old continent was already taken. Holding her flight tickets in\
  \ her hands and excited, she was waiting to board the plane, her first flight. She\
  \ has never been on a plane before at her age, 33. Her first destination was London\
  \ - England - where her friend was waiting for her. As soon as she put a step on\
  \ this huge \u201CHeathrow\u201D airport, she knew she had taken the right decision.\n\
  During the next sixteen days, they traveled from one country to another, by all\
  \ means of transport available. Buses, ferries, trains, planes, bicycles and trams\
  \ were their best companions along their way. Hostels, their temporary homes. Long\
  \ waits on airports were synonyms of low-cost flights and all of them were at the\
  \ crack of dawn. From England to France, Holland, and Germany. They decided where\
  \ to go day by day.\nWith a return ticket to her previous life, Elena booked her\
  \ last stop \u201CDublin\u201D. Oh, Dublin\u2026. Who\u2019d have ever thought what\
  \ this Green Island had for her? She left her luggage in London at her friend\u2019\
  s place. A small purple backpack was all she was carrying. She didn\u2019t need\
  \ anything else for three days. She was all alone now.\nAfter arriving in Dublin\
  \ Terminal, she took a bus to the city center. Her first attempt to communicate\
  \ with an Irish bus driver made her rethink her knowledge about English. It was\
  \ mid-February, not the best time for Europe and mainly for Ireland. Cold weather,\
  \ miserable winter, sudden rains and drizzles, grey and misty views. Despite the\
  \ well-known climate of this city, Elena fall in love of its spirit, of its cheerful\
  \ and peculiar people. Walking its cobbled streets along the temple bar area and\
  \ contemplating the unique green of St. Stephen\u2019s Green Park, Merrion Square,\
  \ Iveagh Garden, and the endless way along the Phoenix Park were enough to change\
  \ her mind.\nShe find out that Dublin had a mysterious or supernatural power to\
  \ make things happen, to make you come across with wonderful people, to shut doors\
  \ and open windows at the same time, to make you experience four seasons in a day\
  \ or in an hour, to teach you what diversity and multiculturalism is, to understand\
  \ that go for \u201Ca\u201D drink doesn\u2019t really mean so, to not need an umbrella\
  \ to walk under the rain, and to learn to deal with your emotion in a miserable\
  \ grey day.\nDublin gave Elena a second chance to start over again, to appreciate\
  \ what she already had, to be grateful of just being, to understand old wounds,\
  \ to overcome the fear of the unknown. Travelling gave Elena a love and new experiences\
  \ and inspired her to keep on learning and rediscovering herself."
