Text: "When i come to Cuiab\xE1 from the Stone jungle, S\xE3o Paulo,  for study Foresty\
  \ Engineer i didn't know that the Brazilian Cerrado was so rich until i go for the\
  \ first time to Chapada dos Guimar\xE3es and  and I came upon giant rock walls formed\
  \ by the wind on the road, which once were once covered by the sea is only 1 hour\
  \ away travelling of the hot weather capital of Mato Grosso, but the way is so beautiful,\
  \ it seems 1 minute.\n\nAlthough of the two stations of 6 months of rains and 6\
  \ months of pure dry, the nature seems to know how to show their beauty, in the\
  \ rain days by their beautiful waterfalls and in the dry season with diferent types\
  \ of flowers and colors.\n\nUpon arriving in the city of Chapada dos Guimar\xE3\
  es, our eyes fill with pure charm, from what looks like a small village trapped\
  \ in the time of ancient colonial Brazil. \nThere is the option to stay in several\
  \ campsites spread around the city, or hostels. I advise the campsites to those\
  \ who want to save money, and live a complete contact experience with nature.\n\n\
  Speaking of nature there are lots of options for tours, which you can do with local\
  \ guides such as the trail of the 7 waterfalls, aroejari cave and stone town. Or\
  \ call friends and go to various waterfalls like the tortoise, the monkeys, the\
  \ secret and the salting. Some there is the option of renting to camp with a group\
  \ of friends like Cristal. Who likes trails, there is the trail of the honey and\
  \ the hill of santo ant\xF4nio.\n\nThis gift of nature, is well here, but few know\
  \ it, the Mato Grosso culture, is rich and is present in all places of the city,\
  \ whether with sculptures of their own instrument , the \"viola the coxo\", or freshwater\
  \ fish and typical dish maria izabel, this corner of Brazil surprised me too much\
  \ and is a good request for those who want to innovate, and to put as a priority\
  \ for the next vacations."
