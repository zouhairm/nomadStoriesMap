Text: "It is just an other morning in San Francisco. The weather is good, the coffee\
  \ is strong as my French taste buds like it! \n\nMy friend and I decided to wandering\
  \ around. He lives in the suburb of The Mission. At the corner of the 21th and Bryant\
  \ street. We went up to Portrero hill, then down until the 20th stop. I mean, going\
  \ further would have make us cross the bay. \n\nWe actually arrives at Pier70. A\
  \ disaffected maritime fabric that was active during WWII and the architectural\
  \ revolution of the city. But what we can see now is more like a bunch of  deteriorating\
  \  buildings. At the entrance, we can read on some scary dissuasive panels; advises\
  \ of an imminente death if we cross the fence. \LBoth of us are abandoned places\
  \ lovers though so\u2026 We passed the first fence, arrived in between two large\
  \ trucks and sneaked into a hole that we found in the second barbed wire. \n\nWhat\
  \ we saw was quite impressive. This industrial building was huge! Half of the rooftop\
  \ was falling apart, which drew a  puzzle of light and shadow on the floor. \nOne\
  \ part of the wall was missing, that offered us a great view on the water and others\
  \ interesting constructions. We sat here, lightening up a cigarette, on the edge\
  \ of the structure, in the middle of a truly sparkling environment.  \LThere was\
  \ graffitis everywhere, on every surfaces! Empty beers can on the floor\u2026 while\
  \ my friend was skateboarding, running and jumping around (yes. My friend is an\
  \ adult!), I was starting to day dream.\n\n\LI especially love those \u201Ctransition-places\u201D\
  . The municipality works on making the Pier70 the next trendy hipster place. There\
  \ will be arts & creative spaces, light-manufacturing, local retail, nine acres\
  \ of waterfront parks\u2026 \nIn some years we will have forgotten that it also\
  \ had been a place of complete freedom. Where people could express their arts on\
  \ walls whoever they were. They could just come and let the time flows without pressure.\
  \ Hidden from the rest of the world."
