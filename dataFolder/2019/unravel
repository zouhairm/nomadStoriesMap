Text: "As I walked down the colorful streets of Nablus, with its multicoloured shops\
  \ and people shouting \"1 kilo Tomatoes for a schekel\", you can not help yourself\
  \ but feel home when you aren't home. The friendliness of every shop owner is not\
  \ found anywhere and they're not being friendly because they expect you to buy anything\
  \ from their shop, no, it's just out of their nature. I spotted a shop full of antiques\
  \ and that catechesis my attention, not only because small antique shops are photogenic\
  \ but becausey brother has always wanted an antique spoon to fit in his food blog.\
  \ I entered the shop with a friend of mine and the shop owner began to tell us his\
  \ short story about antiques. \n\"I collect antiques because it's a hobby, I am\
  \ originally an engineer but I have retired and wanted to do something I truly love.\
  \ I already have secured my children's future and they have both graduated from\
  \ college. If you want a spoon I will find you a spoon with the price that makes\
  \ you comfortable but also look, I've got birth stones. I am guessing you are a\
  \ nice person, indecisive but also nice and you take care of the people around you,\
  \ so your stone is this pink guy right here\". To be honest I don't quite remember\
  \ the name of that stone but it was a pretty stone that I didn't buy (surprise).\
  \ He looked over my friend and described her with everything she isn't. We held\
  \ our happy laughter until we were a mile away from the shop after we telling him\
  \ goodbye and him giving us a short meaningful prayer.\n\nIt was a blast."
