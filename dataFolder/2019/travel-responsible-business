Text: "I am absolutely travel enthusiastic person, i like to discover new places,\
  \ meet people, learn new culture,  and enjoy food. I started travelling at the age\
  \ of 25 yrs old, by travelling from Somalia to Ethiopia, and Djibouti. \n\nFirst\
  \ it was fears about flying with an airplane because i fear high places, so ny first\
  \ trip was so horrible that i even decided to travel on foot though it was impossible\
  \ to hike for long distances. Then i arrived in Ethiopia and in Djibouti, the food,\
  \ the culture attracted me to love travelling and overcome my fears of being on\
  \ high place.\n\nMy next trip was in 2009 from Ethiopia to Egypt and to Russia...this\
  \ trip was full of joys and experiencea e.g. learning new cultures and new languages.\
  \ In late 2009 i travelled from Moscow to Moldova, and then from Moldova to Ukraine.\
  \ In 2010, i travelled from Ukraine to Switzerland.\n\nSo i adopted travelling culture\
  \ like a nomad with herds of camels always looking for grassing land. I travelled\
  \ to Italy, Belgium, Netherland, Germany, Austria, France, Luxemburg, and Sweden.\
  \ Taking into account ho2 started travelling and how i ended up being nomad who\
  \ always travells and enjoys travelling is a strong demontsration that i am nomad\
  \ by blood. If you look at Somali people, they are camel keepers and always from\
  \ search grassing land, always on the move.\n\nI believe being Somali nomad eased\
  \ for me to live like a nomad who is always on a trip to somewhere in the world\
  \ enjoying the beautiful landscapes, the culture, food, and fostering contacts with\
  \ new people always and almost in every trip. Travelling became an important party\
  \ of my life and i believe travelling changed my life into very positive and easy\
  \ to adoot and accept other cuktures even if they are extremely different than my\
  \ culture. I speak almost five languages which eases my travell challanges wherever\
  \ and whenever."
