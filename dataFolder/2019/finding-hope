Text: "We followed Mati up the stairs and into a cramped waiting room at the carabinieri\
  \ station. The walls were yellowed and mostly bare, save for a few signs posted\
  \ in Italian. There were four or five other people already sitting there when we\
  \ walked in, and the three of us moved toward open chairs next to the window. \n\
  \nAn hour before, my husband and I stood looking into the empty trunk of our rental\
  \ car as the color washed out of both our faces. I had been walking a few steps\
  \ ahead of him as he popped the trunk. We had groceries for the next day\u2019s\
  \ travels and we were ready to get on the road after a few hours spent touring Milan.\
  \ \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s all gone,\u201D I let out as I pushed up the door of the trunk\
  \ and quickly moved around the car to look in the backseat, hopelessly thinking\
  \ that I had forgotten we\u2019d left our bags there instead. \n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CEverything\u2019s gone,\u201D I repeated as I looked back at him and\
  \ felt my throat tighten. \n\nWe had stored all of our luggage in the car as we\
  \ left that morning to take the metro to do some sightseeing. Now, everything but\
  \ one bag and a couple loose pieces of clothing were taken. Our laptop, gone. Our\
  \ cameras, gone. Our clothes and shoes, gone. \n\nAnd then I remembered our travel\
  \ journal. \n\nGone. \n\nThe tears came immediately. It contained stories, pictures,\
  \ and notes from the previous five weeks we\u2019d been on the road. In it I had\
  \ kept the names of all the people we\u2019d met on our journey, and Dustin had\
  \ doodled and journaled in it on a daily basis. We didn\u2019t want to bring it\
  \ with us that day because we wanted to carry as little as possible, but now it\
  \ was gone.\n\nAfter a few minutes of fruitlessly trying to figure out what to do,\
  \ I pulled out my phone to call Mati. We\u2019d just hugged and said our goodbyes\
  \ in the Piazza del Duomo, and I didn\u2019t want to bother her with a problem of\
  \ our own making. She stopped me mid-sentence and said in her no-nonsense way, \u201C\
  Send me your location, I\u2019m coming over.\u201D\n\nThat was just so Mati. We\
  \ first met her in a small fishing village on the Greek island of Lesvos. We were\
  \ volunteering with the same NGO, and in the short time that our stints overlapped,\
  \ we\u2019d made a connection. Having been there a few months prior to our arrival,\
  \ she was always willing to answer our questions or step in and help. Throughout\
  \ the time that we were there, we worked countless hours together on spotting, landing,\
  \ and camp shifts. \n\nAs we sat together once again, this time in a carabinieri\
  \ station in Milan, I silently recalled the situation we left behind in Skala Sikamineas.\
  \ Scenes of refugees played on a loop in my mind. I thought about everything they\
  \ left behind--the photos, the keepsakes, the heirlooms. I thought about the seawater-soaked\
  \ garbage bags that held their remaining possessions and the cold, wet clothing\
  \ that hung off their exhausted bodies. I thought about the immeasurable losses\
  \ they had suffered prior to making the decision to seek out safety in a foreign\
  \ land. \n\nBut then I remembered something else. Despite everything they had been\
  \ through, there was still hope in their tired eyes. A faint glimmer hardly recognizable,\
  \ but hope, nonetheless. I saw it in the eyes of the elderly woman who allowed me\
  \ to help dry her feet and pull on warm socks and shoes. And I saw it in the eyes\
  \ of the young mother who carefully handed me her child to hold as she tended to\
  \ her other two. Hope is what connected us for the few brief moments I shared with\
  \ each of those women. \n\nNow, as I exchanged glances with Mati and Dustin, I felt\
  \ that same hope rising in myself. Sitting together, I was reminded that there were\
  \ some things that could only be learned through heartbreak. I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ it, but I was grateful."
