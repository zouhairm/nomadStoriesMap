Text: "In the summer of 2018, I embarked on a field trip to Amboli, North Western\
  \ Ghats to see a tiny beauty that dwells in this wet wilderness. I lived there for\
  \ two weeks, in one of the wettest places in India where the clouds never part the\
  \ trees. It is a forest with life to its brim and lush greenery that pierces the\
  \ gaze. I used to leave into these whistling woods daily in the twilight, following\
  \ the calls of love along the innumerable streams, searching for my tiny beauty.\
  \ \nThere I found her. A female of Nyctibatrachus petrae, on the way to find her\
  \ suitor. An ordinary frog, you might say. I dare you to think twice. These are\
  \ creatures of wonder. When you hear the call of a lovelorn male in the starlit\
  \ night, not in your dreams you would think of it coming from a frog. Even a nightingale\
  \ would be mesmerized by it. After hearing it, you would realize that all you grew\
  \ up with was a blatant lie that frogs croak. No, these frogs whistle with a pitch\
  \ of an opera singer and some of these almost sing, in rapture with the growing\
  \ darkness of the night. But there is something else mysterious about these frogs\
  \ that I found out. Unlike most frogs, these lay terrestrial eggs, on leaves hanging\
  \ over water streams. When the eggs develop, the tadpoles wriggle out of its jelly\
  \ and fall right into the stream below, where they continue their lifecycle. \n\
  During my stay, I used to go out walking in the streams in the twilight just before\
  \ the show begins where males compete with each other with their orchestra of melodious\
  \ calls to lure the female. But walking along those cold water streams under moonlight\
  \ also means unwelcoming encounters with other denizens of the rainforest.\nIt turned\
  \ out that I wasn\u2019t the only one out in the late hours. There was our not so\
  \ friendly neighbour, a Malabar pit viper. Pit vipers altogether have a different\
  \ class and charisma when it comes to snakes. They are called pit vipers not because\
  \ they live in pits but that they have an extraordinarily heat-sensitive pit organ\
  \ located between the eye and the nostril on both sides of the head. With these,\
  \ they can sense even tiny temperature differences. No wonder, these are one of\
  \ the most sophisticated ambush predators in the wild.\nAccording to a pit viper,\
  \ the most important principle of life is to wait. After they find a suitable spot\
  \ beside the stream, they patiently wait for days, even weeks till something live\
  \ and edible passes them and snap! the meal is ready.  I walked past the pit-viper\
  \ appreciating its panache and feeling thankful for escaping a direct encounter.\
  \ After walking a few metres, I came across a low-hanging branch with something\
  \ that appeared like a fur ball on it. I walked closer shining my torch on low beam.\
  \ An oriental kingfisher sleeping with all its oriental charm. With an azure blue\
  \ and iridescent yellow body and protruding orange beak, it was gracefully sleeping\
  \ above my head. I could almost hear its heartbeat in my head, as I watched its\
  \ body rise and fall with each breath. I carefully went under the branch as to not\
  \ disturb it.\nFrom a bizarre angry bird look-alike, Sri Lanka frogmouth to swift\
  \ and dazzling Blue Mormon butterflies with black velvety wings, every creature\
  \ that inhabited this forest is stunning beyond descriptions. There is even a fungus,\
  \ which grows on decaying woods and glows with a faint tinge of green. But there\
  \ was nothing as enchanting as witnessing the landscape transform in the months\
  \ of monsoon. Every year, something akin to magic unfolds all over the Indian subcontinent\
  \ but nowhere is the transformation as intense as it is experienced in Amboli. Hundreds\
  \ and possibly thousands of rivulets and small waterfalls are sprung forth within\
  \ a span of few days. Life forms of all kinds gather in profusion in these ephemeral\
  \ water bodies, bearing a testament to the celebration of life itself.\n\nAs a \
  \ flood of fluttering butterflies and raucous calls of amorous frogs greeted me,\
  \ I slowly walked out of that untamed Eden."
