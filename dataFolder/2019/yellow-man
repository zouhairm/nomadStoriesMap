Text: "Yellow Man showed up. This wasn\u2019t a complete surprise but I\u2019d wondered\
  \ if his commitment was genuine given the many places he could have partied that\
  \ Saturday night, also for free. He\u2019d hitched a ride east to my grandparents\u2019\
  \ house, about fifteen miles of twisting, orange dirt roads and settled under the\
  \ expansive tent with a bottle of overproof, offbeats blasting from a row of speakers.\
  \ His presence was met with crescendoed cackles and slaps on the back; he was there\
  \ to celebrate the life of my dear aunt with plenty of rum and dancing.\n\nWe landed\
  \ in Jamaica the day before and after a four-hour drive from Kingston (two hours\
  \ longer than it should have taken), my dad, some cousins and I arrived in St Elizabeth,\
  \ where anything can be planted and grown to perfection in the magical orange dirt.\
  \ This was not tourist Jamaica and infinitely better. My cousins and family gathered\
  \ at my grandparents\u2019 house where the land now held two additional homes. It\
  \ looked built up yet smaller than twenty years ago, the last time I\u2019d put\
  \ eyes on the place. But familiarity came with mountain air, the richest green of\
  \ ackee tree leaves and a cinder-smell off the fire for cooking\u2014this bridged\
  \ any disconnection. My dad visited with his parents in the burial plot and people\
  \ joked with me about being away so long. The mood remained light as we hadn\u2019\
  t seen each other in ages, but the business of death followed us.  \n\nIt was the\
  \ next day that we ran into Yellow Man after the tire on our car exploded. He\u2019\
  d come to our aid and he and my dad recognized each other directly. It took me a\
  \ minute but I remembered because ultimately how could I not? Yellow Man knew the\
  \ family from way back and dated one of my cousins. Called yellow due to his light\
  \ skin, eyes and hair, he yelled even while whispering and spoke with a damn-near\
  \ toothless grin. That hadn\u2019t changed in twenty years, and there was something\
  \ off-putting about him being exactly the same for all that time. But he called\
  \ on his connections and we had a new tire in under an hour, impressive since time\
  \ isn\u2019t always literal with Jamaicans. He assured us we\u2019d have Yellow\
  \ Man at the set up that night.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter to me. He was nice and\
  \ all but at least 100 \u2018mourners\u2019 from the parish would pour down the\
  \ narrow rock road to the property to pay their respects. Note this was a party\
  \ where any random could stroll up and partake in a seemingly endless supply of\
  \ spirits, freshly fried fish, dumplings, curried goat, and piles and plates and\
  \ bowls of more food. American-me hated that people we didn\u2019t know thought\
  \ it appropriate to come eat and drink and as I mentioned this to my dad, Yellow\
  \ Man wandered over with his apparent hyper-acute hearing. \u201CRelax and en\u2026\
  jah\u2026ee, bay-bee,\u201D he crooned. He went on that set up tradition has changed\
  \ here and there but for now, this is what it was. \n\nYellow Man bounced around\
  \ and stole laughter from people with his impressions and jokes, much attention\
  \ on my weeping cousins. Although the night was more fun than somber, barring an\
  \ alcohol/grief-driven quarrel among some family members, his energy helped. He\
  \ wasn\u2019t family but showed up like family, and my distrust and irritation about\
  \ his lack of change changed.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to see him at the church or\
  \ burial the next day and indeed he did not appear, but I found myself wishing he\
  \ had while my cousins inconsolably slapped cement on the grave, molding a blanket\
  \ over the place that would keep their mother\u2019s body. \u201CNo grave\u2026\
  can hold my body down,\u201D the crowd of many sang and stomped, arms raised to\
  \ the heavens. Sobering doesn\u2019t quite describe the scene but that\u2019s the\
  \ best I\u2019ve got.\n\nChange is fleeting, overrated and inevitable all at once,\
  \ and we\u2019re useful for what we\u2019re useful for. As our plane ascended the\
  \ runway I looked down on the island and said goodbye to my aunt, then wondered\
  \ where Yellow Man was until I couldn\u2019t see land anymore."
