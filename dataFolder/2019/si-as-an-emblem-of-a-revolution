Text: "Yellow, blue and red everywhere. Flags, hidden in plain sight, never too loud,\
  \ and never too quiet. In a small alley, there was a poster hanged behind the bars\
  \ of a historical castle, the poster read \u201CFree political prisoners\u201D,\
  \ where and an opera street singer was standing between these castle walls, using\
  \ them to echo her voice. That day, I accompanied my travel group to La Rambla,\
  \ the tree-lined pedestrian touristic street that extends between the seashore and\
  \ the local food market. Packed with tourists, filled with mosaic tiles and buildings,\
  \ with its colorful food market and unbelievably delicious food, Barcelona looked\
  \ like a never-ending festival, like a city that was never bothered with anything\
  \ or anyone, a city created to celebrate. But maybe I\u2019ve known better, or I\
  \ didn\u2019t actually, not until I was there! I was there only a few months after\
  \ their independence referendum. A political movement that didn\u2019t really concern\
  \ me, again not until I was there! Barcelona is a metropolitan city just like Cairo,\
  \ my hometown, and just like every other metropolitan I\u2019ve been to. Its districts\
  \ resembled those of Istanbul\u2019s and Cairo\u2019s, but right beneath the surface\
  \ there were untold stories, behind the festivities, there was a city that tried\
  \ to change its history and failed\u2026\nAnd I knew the feeling, I knew the meaning\
  \ of the chants filling the streets, of flags as a sign of freedom, hope and home.\
  \ I don\u2019t know how close their movement was close to a revolution, but I know\
  \ that every sign there reminded me of that failed Egyptian revolution in my home\
  \ country. The flags were hanged everywhere, on doors, on balconies, glued to walls\
  \ but never with a person. I wished I could knock on every balcony to ask about\
  \ their story like it was the only that mattered. And it was. Their mosaic story\
  \ was not merely a number of supporters or protestors, nor the number of people\
  \ hurt in clashes. Their mosaic story were made of many tiny ones, that were someone\u2019\
  s dream and hope and another\u2019s utmost fear. They are stories are about someone\u2019\
  s friend, daughter, father or son. And they are worth telling in every step along\
  \ the way. I wished I could master enough Spanish to hear every story and to share\
  \ those of mine, those stories that are best described as Dickens had put it \u201C\
  They were the best of times, they were the worst of times\u201D. But I didn\u2019\
  t understand Spanish, not a word, except one, I left their shore town with \u201C\
  Si\u201D engraved in my heart, as a sign of the common dots that can be found in\
  \ the most unexpected places."
