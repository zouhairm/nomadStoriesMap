Text: "It was indeed exactly like the domino efffect. The whole constructions of my\
  \ life were shattering one after the other and I was watching it just like an audience\
  \ of any musical.\n  After experiencing a tremendous heartbreak and financial crisis,\
  \ just when I thought that everything around me had started to crumble, suddenly\
  \ the last salary cheque that I deposited got cleared. An adrenaline rush kicked\
  \ in of breaking the barriers of the constraints and finding a place where I could\
  \ feel a sense of belonging. Not just that I guess, perhaps, I wanted to go anywhere\
  \ to find a sense of hope. The very next day I had around 5,000 INR through which\
  \ I booked my ticket for Hrishikesh, Uttrakhand in India. Also, it was the first\
  \ time I was advancing towards a solo trip. I was nervous and exuberantly joyous\
  \ of the unknown experience. I boarded the New Delhi- Dehradun Shatabdi around 6:40am\
  \ and landed at Haridwar junction around 11:00am. \n As I exited the station, I\
  \ found a beautiful traveler from Chile standing perplexed to hire a taxi (tuk-tuk)\
  \ till Hrishikesh. Fortunately, a bit of my Spanish skills helped us in bonding\
  \ with each other within 2 minutes and we ended up sharing the tuk-tuk ( local auto).\
  \ Her love for the Ayurveda always brought her back to the land. After sharing couple\
  \ of jokes and exchange of the cultural information we finally arrived at our destination.\
  \ I booked myself a backpacker hostel named zostel where I managed to get a room\
  \ at just INR 400/- per night in an eight dorm bed.  That dormitory was a mix of\
  \ all the international fellow travelers with an extremely beautiful energy just\
  \ flowing at ease from all of them.\n  There I happened to meet a guy who was from\
  \ the United States with the heart of a gypsy and with a soul of a poet. Everyday\
  \ he used to sit in the terrace and gaze at the exquisite peaks covered with the\
  \ lush snow in the Himalayas . He was gags over the various cakes which were the\
  \ one of the best specialty of the region. Every morning at around 10:00am was the\
  \ walk till the Neem Beach down the road. The coast of the Ganges, beautifully being\
  \ guarded with the mountains all around. The intensity of faith that the foreigners\
  \ developed for my culture, I witnessed it at the beach, which left me pondering\
  \ about my negligence.\n  The next day there was an exchange about the music and\
  \ it\u2019s impact on the human mind. While talking people themselves turned into\
  \ a beautiful piece of art, the way their body was denoting the move of the strings\
  \ of the instruments and the beat of the percussion captivated me. In just three\
  \ days, life started building itself again with such love and beauty around me.\
  \ Surprisingly, I discovered that I was not alone through the suffering. Coincidentally,\
  \ there were people who were experiencing the exact same emotion like me. I was\
  \ astonished. However, this time, after a very long break I started liking someone\
  \ again exactly with the same old innocent stupid way, however, after 3 days when\
  \ the time came for letting go and moving on to the next destination (varanasi),\
  \ I felt liberated while parting ways with a lot of happiness in my heart.\n   This\
  \ time we all parted ways with a hope to see each other again one day or maybe not?\
  \ Who knows? I returned to Delhi on 28th Feb as a completely changed person."
