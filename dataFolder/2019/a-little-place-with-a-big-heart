Text: "Half Crown, I called it, the small town in the middle of the mountains. One\
  \ that no one would go to without a cause, because it was just that, normal, and\
  \ there were probably a thousand Italian towns just like it. But I did have a cause,\
  \ I was teaching English to the Italian children who lived there. I stayed with\
  \ a family who had a cat, who loved each other, who laughed at the dinner table\
  \ and could sit in silence together without it being deafening. I stayed with a\
  \ family who were just like mine. \n\nOne night we went up to the top of the mountain\
  \ in a cable car, and we ate in an empty restaurant. We spoke about how people lived\
  \ in the mountains, and how past 11 at night they were trapped there, and until\
  \ 7 in the morning they could not leave. What in any other place would evoke fear\
  \ in me, only gave me an acceptance and understanding. The people who lived on the\
  \ mountains, they were lucky to live the simple life. The next night, we went to\
  \ get ice creams, or gelato, from the centre of town, a 5 minute walk. My family\
  \ said hello, or grazie, to everyone they passed on the street, and everyone said\
  \ it in return. Other families also gathered at the gelato shop, it was dark and\
  \ late but it was warm. We went to see family friends, the Mother's cousin was helping\
  \ set up the wine festival that would take place the following night. The people\
  \ I met were interested to meet me, and I them. \n\nThe next night was the night\
  \ of the annual wine festival. People from far and wide came to see the Half Crown.\
  \ It was raining but the music rang in the air as loudly as thunder, and the clunk\
  \ of wine glasses rung as magnificently in the air as the sound of drunken parties\
  \ paraded the streets. The small town in the mountains was as big as any city tonight,\
  \ it was as important as a place rampant with hurrying crowds, because this little\
  \ place held families that were families to each other. Strangers didn't exist here,\
  \ and when I was one, I was only for a moment. \n\nOn my last night in the Half\
  \ Crown, a little girl I taught came running up to me across the street from the\
  \ restaurant she was at with her parents. She leapt up into my arms and played with\
  \ my hair. I played with hers and we didn't say a word. I glanced back at her family\
  \ in the restaurant, just to check, and they beamed back at me. I tried to speak\
  \ to her, to say anything, but she vanished, her hair swinging as she ran away.\
  \ Her name was Julia. I'd never forget her."
