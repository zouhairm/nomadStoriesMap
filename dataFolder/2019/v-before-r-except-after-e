Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find the tiny Italian village high in the mountains\
  \ of Tuscany, hidden amidst clouds and grazing cows to the outside world below.\
  \ After all, it was only a scraggly, hand written notation on a piece of manuscript\
  \ intended for the sole purpose of recording the family lineage- the births, the\
  \ marriages, and deaths- of ancestors from a bygone era. Piere di Villa di Bagni\
  \ di Lucca. Where in the world was that and what could it possibly mean to me?\n\
  As a younger woman, I was never much interested in my mother\u2019s preoccupation\
  \ with Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. She contributed to the statue\u2019\
  s facelift in the 1980s. She dreamed of travelling to New York City and seeing to\
  \ it that her mother\u2019s name was inscribed on the American Immigrant Wall of\
  \ Honor. She, at least, understood that the Bilenchi family had given up everything\
  \ they knew in their homeland of Italy and endured the challenges and hardships\
  \ that faced the families that dared to leave their homelands behind during the\
  \ flood of immigration to the United States in the 1800s.\nIt was not until my mother\
  \ passed away, dreams of travel and Ellis Island unfilled, did I realize the significance\
  \ of the wonderful story of a woman who arrived on the doorsteps of New York City\
  \ as a bundled baby girl. I somehow knew then that I had a mission to complete for\
  \ my mother, retracing the steps of her mother, my grandmother, that forever changed\
  \ the lives of all of us.\nWhat better excuse could I possibly come up with for\
  \ an adventure to Europe?! My travel mate from our very first European adventure\
  \ when were but teens had arranged to meet me in Florence. At 17 and 18 years of\
  \ age, we\u2019d both been taken with the power and the grace of the city. Once\
  \ more, we found ourselves enveloped by the sheer essence of the birthplace of the\
  \ Renaissance. \nOver wine and pasta outside the Duomo, the Cathedra of Santa Maria\
  \ del Fiore, we went over the dubious plan to make our way blindly to a village\
  \ I had thus far not been able to locate on a map or find a reference point of any\
  \ sort for with Google. Our Italian was nonexistent. We hadn\u2019t traversed the\
  \ Italian countryside together in almost 45 years!\nThe clerk at the hotel had never\
  \ heard of Piere di Villa di Bagni di Lucca but she suggested that the city of Lucca,\
  \ 48 miles Northwest of Florence, might be a good starting point. In Lucca I poured\
  \ over Google maps, regional maps, and maps of provinces. I searched databases and\
  \ name registries. I asked locals for help. I drank Italian wine. I dreamed with\
  \ images of intersections and borders and highways traversing and intersecting in\
  \ my head. And in the morning, an epiphany! \nThe original document denoting the\
  \ birthplace of Angelina Bilenchi, an Italian immigrant, to be Piere di Villa di\
  \ Bagni di Lucca, had been hand written in cursive manuscript. What if, just what\
  \ if\u2026.. the r was not an r at all? What if the archaic style had disguised\
  \ it so and it had really been a v? Was there such a place in Italy, near Bagni\
  \ in the Province of Lucca, known as Pieve di Villa? \nThere was Bagni on the local\
  \ train schedule. There was Pieve di Villa on the regional map, hiding as it has\
  \ for hundreds of years, off the radar screen of the beaten track, resting peacefully\
  \ amid the cedars and the firs in the rolling hills of Tuscany.\nFirst a regional\
  \ train, then a local train (remember to buy those tickets at the tobacco shop,\
  \ not the train station!), a winding and wheezing bus and we were dropped at the\
  \ outskirts of town to walk the remainder on foot. I never thought I\u2019d find\
  \ it. It was a lark. I din\u2019, but only dared to dream, that I would find my\
  \ grandmother\u2019s village. But as we turned the corner, there was the rusted\
  \ and worn sign atop a leaning wooden post:  Welcome to Pieve di Villa di Bagni\
  \ di Lucca!"
