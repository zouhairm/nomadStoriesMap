  \ lofe is easy and amazing, just depending in how you Face it. Live can be very\
  \ funny if you leep your mind and heart as just one, connecting all the sense to\
  \ becoume in just Love and Pssion for being alive.\nAt this loment of my life I\u2019\
  m living and traveling around the world knowing people of every country and discovering\
  \ so many things that it needs to be plasm in some writings. I started traveling\
  \ in Canada, now in australia I\u2019m living as a Backpackers with backpackers\
  \ from different countries and different lifes so I want to get into their lives\
  \ deeply as a remember of the people who has been (and will be) into my life during\
  \ this time. The idea is live in Australia for at least a year living in different\
  \ cities around, getting to different envioremnts that this Country cn offer as\
  \ much as beaches and mountains. I want to plasm the real life around the world,\
  \  trying to survive to this kind of jungle living with different kinds of animals,\
  \ insects, people and much more. Also identify and compare how is living with different\
  \ cultures and enviorements. According to this, Portugal will be an amazing experience\
  \ to approach this differences. Getting this opportunity I will be able to get into\
  \ realities I cannot even imagine. At the same time, I would like to demostrate\
  \ to people that life is just one and they should try to enjoy every moment as unique\
  \ one, even if is not perfect or as they imagined, just living life as reality as\
  \ is it. For that reason and much more I think I could be a good candidate for this\
  \ experience and also, learn about writing and get new ideas for life."
