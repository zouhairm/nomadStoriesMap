Text: "After visiting a few countries within Asia and falling in love with the breathtaking\
  \ scenery and friendly natives, Vietnam seemed the best next step. Months of research,\
  \ looking at weather, routes to gain the best from our short time, accommodation\
  \ that suited our needs and excursions we simply HAD to do, we booked up a 5 stop\
  \ tour, mixing up islands, cities and rural areas. We set off with our preconceptions;\
  \ a moderate stop in Ho Chi Minh, followed by relaxing days in Phu Quoc, scary times\
  \ in our shack near Can Tho, mopeds on Con Son and back to a 5* stop in Ho Chi Minh\
  \ before the long trek home. Landing in Ho Chi Minh, it reminded me of many other\
  \ Asian cities-Bangkok, Siem Reap, Phnom Penh- they all had the crazy, beeping scooters,\
  \ health and safety hazardous lagging wires, hustle and bustle. However, during\
  \ our stay here we visited the Chu Chi tunnels, learning more about the history\
  \ of Southen Vietnam gave you an overwhelming pride in how these people have moved\
  \ past this and even seem to favour Americans over any other nation. We experienced\
  \ a few days here, taking in fermented tofu, several coffee shops, copious walking\
  \ and the markets before moving on to Phu Quoc by propellor plane!!!! Lahana Resort\
  \ was by far one of the most beautiful places I have ever stayed and true to its\
  \ word on any travel site we had seen. The island life was so tame compared to the\
  \ city but we still managed to find a Sky bar-they\u2019re everywhere in Vietnam.\
  \ The beach was beautiful but as we read, all private to each resort. Without sounding\
  \ spoilt, this island was beautiful but not much to offer apart from that, it did\
  \ not set itself apart from other places I\u2019d visited. We moved on to Can Tho\
  \ with our bellies in our mouths, we we so scared about our next adventure.... we\
  \ checked into the shack and after walking over a rope bridge above the Mekong to\
  \ a shack we were left alone, the sound of the wildlife interrupting our every thought.\
  \ The shack was far from what we were used to, with no roof over the bathroom and\
  \ right on the river. We left to go back to the reception to begin our food trip.....taking\
  \ a boat to the heart of Can Tho where we were treated to Vietnam\u2019s delights;\
  \ snake, crocodile, frog and rat. Taking it all on the chin, we tried everything\
  \ and surprisingly I\u2019d definitely eat snake again! After a little walk round\
  \ the night market, we returned to our boat, which was barely bigger than a canoe.\
  \ The four of us climbed in and in the pitch black our captain \u201Csailed\u201D\
  \ us back. To say I was petrified is an understatement but I was totally amazed\
  \ how we glided home, with bare use of lights. Once back, we walked back to our\
  \ shack, climbed under the mosquito net and attempted to sleep. BANG!! Something\
  \ was in our shack and had from what I can gather, fallen from the roof. We immediately\
  \ looked for alternative accommodation for our next night and attempted to get a\
  \ nights sleep. At 4am we woke for our next tour and informed our hosts we wouldn\u2019\
  t be staying. We clambered back into our boat and went out to see the floating markets,\
  \ I had one of the best days of my life with the host and when we returned to the\
  \ shack. We met some amazing travelers, learned interesting stories, tried authentic\
  \ Vietnamese food and enjoyed a local culture. We wanted to stay longer at the shack\
  \ but they\u2019d rebooked our room out, it was too late and the biggest mistake\
  \ of our holiday.....don\u2019t judge a book by its cover, read the first chapter\
  \ and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be hooked."
