Text: "May 16th: When the wheels of the plane came to a stop, the captain\u2019s voice\
  \ carried through the air, announcing our arrival. We had safely landed at Charles\
  \ De Gaulle Airport. I wondered, does De Gaulle mind so many people using his name\
  \ to express the importance of where they are going. Could I not just say I\u2019\
  ve landed at the airport? What difference would it make to one back at home who\
  \ may not distinguish Charles De Gaulle from Orly Airport? Or must I sound polished\
  \ and well-travelled?\n\nWe were greeted by the cold biting air that welcomes you\
  \ to the city that romantic novels are based on. They never write about the deceptively\
  \ warm airport and the shock as the cold air hits you when you insert your melanin\
  \ endowed foot outside the building. Paris, like a beautiful woman aware of her\
  \ beauty, allows you to marvel in it.  As you pass her cafes with people sitting\
  \ outside appreciating the city, as you cross her underbelly using underground trains,\
  \ cruising at respectable speeds marvelling at man-made inventions that make the\
  \ age old \u2018There was traffic\u2019 excuse redundant, you ask yourself if the\
  \ ordinary citizen here would survive a morning\u2019s commute on Jogoo Road (Nairobi).\
  \ But you whisk away the thought, there is no room here for hanging outside the\
  \ train the way manambas (conductors) hang on manyangas (minibuses). But you have\
  \ to understand, there is no air conditioning on the manyangas, how else can one\
  \ get a steady breeze in traffic?\n\nI noticed a gentleman going about his daily\
  \ toil. He was one of the hawkers near the Eiffel Tower, a Senegalese. He looked\
  \ diligent and determined to make a name train for my friend. It's the urgency and\
  \ desperation in his voice that struck me, drew me to him. Is it strange to acknowledge\
  \ this as one of the familiar experiences of my journey? A black man hawking. I\
  \ found myself asking \u2018Why is the black at the bottom of the pyramid in every\
  \ country he goes\u2019 Or is this not so?\n\nAround the city there were many restaurants\
  \ rivalling one another in uniqueness, each suggesting an ambience and a camaraderie\
  \ among its regulars. \n\nWith electric cars plugged into ports around the city,\
  \ the absence of electricity seems a distant thought. I imagine if the train stops\
  \ because of lack of electricity, whoever is in charge would probably resign. It\
  \ seems that in this locale it is possible to resign from a job due to self-conscious\
  \ guilt for a mishap, rather than offer a half-assed apology and sweep the incidence\
  \ under the carpet, as is the norm where I come from. It surprised me to learn,\
  \ days after my travel, that there had been an ongoing train workers\u2019 strike\
  \ during the period of our stay. I asked myself who exactly was on strike. At no\
  \ point did the train delay or stall. Doesn\u2019t a strike mean that systems should\
  \ stop functioning until the grievance is addressed?\n\nThere are many things to\
  \ be seen in travel and some, like the random people in passionate embraces, kissing\
  \ in the streets, trains and buildings of Paris, are faces that fade away when you\
  \ return. You remain with the thoughts inside you, perhaps the shopping bags beside\
  \ you and if you\u2019re lucky, the lessons within you. It is strange to say, but\
  \ I realised I was angry at myself. For romanticising a city that had never once\
  \ thought of me. Had my mind deluded itself into thinking the city awaits me? To\
  \ be hit with a stark reality of automated tourist services, a bus ride with earphones\
  \ to plug in and listen to a recounting of the history of the city, with a recording\
  \ that could have been made any time before our arrival, perhaps even years earlier.\
  \ Angry for wishing and hoping to one day walk in its streets without realising\
  \ that my reasons for desiring it were out of an idea sold to me when I was young,\
  \ that Europe was a place to marvel at and America was a place where dreams come\
  \ true. And Africa, well, it was a place where people desired to leave."
