Text: "In Mexico we have this word \u201Cmalinchista\u201D which stands for La Malinche,\
  \ an Aztec woman, who were to be the mistress and interpreter of conqueror Hern\xE1\
  n Cort\xE9s. Malinchista is an adjective that describes a person who prefers other\
  \ cultures rather than the own. For a culture which was taught for centuries to\
  \ despite the native is not rare to find that almost every Mexican grows to be in\
  \ some such way malinchista.\nAnd as much as I would like to declare the opposite,\
  \ I was no exception. When my family booked a trip to Peru, I had absolutely any\
  \ other expectation than meeting the World Wonder. The country, as much as most\
  \ of Latin America, was somehow out of my radar. For we grew pursuing the dream\
  \ to fly to Europe and cosmopolitan North America.\nNevertheless what I found in\
  \ Peru was far beyond everything I could had possibly imagined. Flying to Peru was\
  \ like flying to a parallel universe where everything was new and yet I\u2019ve\
  \ known it from my entire life. \nGrowing in the Caribbean my image of beach has\
  \ no mountains, sand is soft and white and water warm in emerald and turquoise shades.\
  \ But Lima was like a big mountain that faced the sea. Lima\u2019s shores had no\
  \ sand but pebbles and water was grayish cold, it was a different kind of beauty.\
  \ And still lying in the shore was the same fishing boat I\u2019ve seen every summer.\
  \ Summers I would live around July, but this was December and Lima was in the middle\
  \ of its summer. And like in every past summer I ate ceviche, instead this delicious\
  \ ceviche had sweet potatoes for tomatoes.\nWhile entering further into the city,\
  \ walking thru Lima was an inevitable flashback to Mexico City. The high buildings,\
  \ the foggy air, the noise, the food stands on the streets were like a constant\
  \ d\xE9j\xE0 vu. However all the food in those stands was unfamiliar, foggy air\
  \ was more related to Lima\u2019s particular geographic situation than smog, and\
  \ architecture, although similar, had its own distinguished characteristics such\
  \ as wood balconies.  \nVisiting the historic places was even a more profound echo\
  \ to my own culture. As guides would spoke I felt a voice in the back of my head\
  \ on repeat. All those explanations I\u2019ve heard before, but this time instead\
  \ of Mayans or Aztecs, the main characters were the Incas, what changed were the\
  \ details.\nLanguage, on the other hand, I expected to be slightly different in\
  \ the use on some words and accents, but I never forethought tone could have such\
  \ extraordinarily weight. For some Peruvians would assume we were irate or yelling\
  \ while according to us we were speaking in ordinary manner. Which we found out\
  \ in Aguas Calientes\u2019 market when one of the vendors begged to my uncle \u201C\
  I will find you the shirts you want, but please stop yelling at me\u201D all at\
  \ once all the \u201Ccalm downs\u201D we\u2019ve heard in past days made sense.\n\
  Cuzco, I\u2019d describe as completely unique, along its white architecture with\
  \ contrasting blue and green doors and windows. All the same, my unconsciousness\
  \ would still maneuver to remind me of Mexico and images of San Cristobal de las\
  \ Casas would replay on my mind, the hills and cold and humid weather. Moreover\
  \ crafts and pompoms would strengthen the connection. \nAt glance, the traditional\
  \ food market in Cuzco, could be any market in Mexico. Until I got closer: quinoa,\
  \ maca, coca\u2026. None of them I could find in my local market, and some others\
  \ I could were completely different. Papaya was not the electric orange I knew,\
  \ but yellow and tasted as fusioned with mango. And even corn would have many different\
  \ varieties I\u2019ve never seen. It is fascinating how corn can be the basis of\
  \ the diet of both cultures and still species are diverse enough to change between\
  \ countries.\nUndoubtedly the beautiful images of Machu Picchu and The Andes will\
  \ stay in my mind forever. But the strange feeling of knowing the unknown, my heart\
  \ will always cherish."
