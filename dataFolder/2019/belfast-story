Text: "Belfast Story\n\nWe missed our flight back to Dublin from Portugal through\
  \ all faults of my own and got a different flight to Belfast the next day. At the\
  \ check-in I wondered if this was the only place where both sides of the community\
  \ mixed. But on board, I quickly realised everything was orange. Even the steward\u2019\
  s outfits were orange.\n\nA big Britannia tattooed Johnny Adair look-alike sat behind\
  \ us with his noisy kids and two skin-heads flirted with the staff up front. It\
  \ was quite possible that we were flying with only one side of the great northern\
  \ divide while all the nationalists used Ryanair.\n\nMy brow started to sweat as\
  \ it became apparent that we were now deep in enemy territory at thirty-eight thousand\
  \ feet. There was nowhere to go and a walk outside in the fresh air was out of the\
  \ question. Of course Tara was oblivious to my wild flights of paranoid fancy and\
  \ blabbered away to everyone in earshot. The whole plane knew we were from the South\
  \ by now. The elderly conservative couple beside me sat frozen together, not saying\
  \ a word for the entire journey. An orangey sun-tanned lady with a pearl dotted\
  \ scarf glanced back at us with a Clint Eastwood squint.\n\n'Do you know the bus\
  \ times from Belfast to Dublin?\u2019 Tara cheerily asked the grim head stewardess\
  \ as she approached.\n'I wouldn't know that, I'm from Portadown' she retorted, pointing\
  \ her gold crown-topped pen in the general direction of a far off unionist town.\
  \ 'But I'll ask the others and get back to you on that', she said with a forced\
  \ smile and continued on.\n\nAt that stage I had the emergency flight manual up\
  \ to my face, checking out the quick exits. Behind me, I felt the dull gaze of Adair's\
  \ now silent children. Up front, Ms. Portadown was discussing Tara's question with\
  \ another steward while I watched the two skin-heads look menacingly back in our\
  \ direction.\n\nThe sun-tanned lady shifted and one of the pearls came loose and\
  \ dropped to the ground. Just as she bent down to pick it up, it rolled towards\
  \ me. I stopped it with my boot, cowboy-style, picked it up and gave it back to\
  \ her with a smile. She nodded an embarrassed thank you, then quickly turned away.\n\
  \nTara sat back and took a sip of her coffee. I started to calm down and put the\
  \ manual back as the flight continued in silence. Then suddenly I jolted up when\
  \ Tara turned to me and loudly said \u2018at least we are landing on the island\
  \ of Ireland\u2019. The silence that was already there turned deafening as the North\
  \ is apparently not part of Ireland in their minds.\n\nBelfast was freezing as we\
  \ waited for the bus to town. And then we were off and the city lights lit up in\
  \ front of us. I hadn't seen the place since the 1970s, when we drove there in my\
  \ Grand Aunt\u2019s Ford Anglia. British soldiers were everywhere. But this night,\
  \ all these years later, all was calm as the lights flickered over the old Titanic\
  \ town.\n\nWe were early for the bus to Dublin which was parked across from the\
  \ famous old Crown bar. A heritage building now, where even the toilets were so\
  \ heritaged as to make the 1970s seem like the Golden Age. Tara dragged me for a\
  \ cigarette in front of the Europa hotel and went on to explain that it was the\
  \ most bombed hotel in Europe in its day. I nervously urged her gently  away from\
  \ the foyer and told her that a bomb went off in Derry two weeks previously.\n\n\
  Then finally we got on the bus to Dublin, only to find that the driver had put on\
  \ a documentary about the SAS in Iraq. Bombs going off, helicopter gunships shooting.\
  \ Agonising torture scenes. Of all the places to put on such a cheerful documentary,\
  \ it would have to be Belfast.\n\nAll in all it was great to live to see the North\
  \ of Ireland while it was still part of the UK.\n\n\xA9 Kevin McCarthy"
