Text: "One year ago I made my very first leap into the unknow. I take a plane to an\
  \ outlying city called Huelva, nearby the Altantic Ocean , one step away from Portugal.\
  \ My first erasmus programme, my first challenge, my first solo. When I arrived\
  \ in Huelva I didn\u2019t speak spanish at all, but oh my god all my exams were\
  \ in mother tongue, not only I haven\u2019t no idea of what the city was like\u2026\
  \ I had to learn in every way to plane in the void! Placed  suitcases in my new\
  \ spanish bedroom I decided that the best way to start my journey was to get lost\
  \ in the small streets of Huelva and enjoying all his beautiful colors,the music\
  \ in this forening language talked by these spanish strangers. Two hours two friends\
  \ ago, my idea of the city was litteraly different than the one I had before take\
  \ a plane that morning. I thought that was an insipid puny town fill of nothing\
  \ good, I discovered that was an unusual town fill of chuerches and smiling and\
  \ pleasant people.The lagoon surrunded the city,the twilight sitting in front of\
  \ the Muelle was perfect combined with an iced cerveza. Soon finded that the starting\
  \ leap into the unknow not was so unknow\u2026 it was the province of where Colombo\
  \ started his journey to America, the must famous and juicy strawberries of Europe\
  \ growed up here. Huelva was a discovery in every respect here discovered even a\
  \ new me. A new Diamante that was having dinner at 10 pm and went to bed at dawn,\
  \ who told pieces of her life to unknows and who shared other new pieces with them.\
  \ The leap I made, I made with strenght and with strenght I reacted. Huelva was\
  \ my springboard , I started to travel in all Andalucia: Malaga, Sevilla,Cordoba,Granada,Cadiz\
  \ and much more. I shared my adventure with local people, shared my meals with new\
  \ friends, tapas are born for this reason, no? Six months of erasmus programe gone\
  \ by a lightning and at the the end the unknown became my ordinary daylife , my\
  \ spanish habits and my best memories."
