Text: "This travel story is about the place called SPITI . It is an cold desert mountain\
  \ located high in Himalayas in the north eastern part of northern Indian state of\
  \ Himachal Pradesh.\nIn terms of travelling I have been always been fascinated with\
  \ the mountain regions . From the cultural aspect always had an keen interest into\
  \ Buddhism. Since Spiti is a perfect amalgamation of both, I felt it\u2019s a right\
  \ place to visit and know more about the Buddhist culture along with witnessing\
  \ some spectacular Himalayan landscapes.\nI  would say I learned a lot about the\
  \ lives of people living in this high trans Himalayan region. Living in harsh weather\
  \ conditions devoid of any kind of modern technologies and yet being happy and graceful.\n\
  Being a regular meditation practitioner ,the  tranquil environment of the Monasteries\
  \ made me feel as if  I belonged to this place .No doubt I got the answer to the\
  \ longing question that How monks could meditate for years and years. There was\
  \ something positive about this place. I could feel the  positive energy in me moment\
  \ after stepping into a monastery ,sitting on that red carpet and closing my eyes.\n\
  Buddhism believes in giving back to the society in such a way that the youngest\
  \ child is sent to be a monk and serve the society. Spotting the young lamas draped\
  \ in red bottom ,learning about their culture from such an early age is something\
  \ that touched me deeply. The people here live a very simple life doing farming\
  \ and staying with the family. \nI have always felt inclination to such a peaceful\
  \ and calm life, that's the reason I felt longing to stay back here, may be forever.\n\
  Going back to this place is the next thing that kept hitting my head after I returned\
  \ from Spiti. I would certainly go back, interact more with locals and monks to\
  \ know the path to the spirituality and simple living which they are master at leading."
