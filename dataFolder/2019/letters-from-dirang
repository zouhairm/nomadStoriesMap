Text: "Tony agreed to meet us beyond the railway crossing of Balipara station after\
  \ much cajoling. We needed a guide for our trip to West Arunachal and since it was\
  \ peak season, it was not easy to find one in such short notice. He was one of the\
  \ guides recommended by our driving agency and more importantly he was the only\
  \ one who answered our call and seemed mildly interested in doing the gig. The price\
  \ was decided, the route was mapped out and off we went.\n\nNameri National Park,\
  \ mountains towns of Bhalukpong flanked by the Bhoreli river, ancient monasteries\
  \ with fluttering prayer flags, icy waterfalls, and rickety bridges, passed us by\
  \ as the winding roads took us deeper into the Himalayas.\n\n \n\nTony was not a\
  \ big talker. However as we traced our way northwards: Dirang-Bomdila-Tawang he\
  \ eased up a bit with us. He was a boy from the mountains and lived in Dirang all\
  \ his life. Life in the mountains was easy and crefree, until the day that his son\
  \ arrived. Dorje was adopted when he lost both his parents in a car accident. He\
  \ was a boy from the village too and Tony and his family took over his responsibility\
  \ ever since the fateful accident. Once he started speaking about Dorje with us,\
  \ there was no turning back. It was as if we had a key to a different world.\n\n\
  \ \nIn the following days, we traversed some difficult terrain.  Sheets of snow\
  \ in sub-zero temperatures to Bumla Pass, where India shares a border with China,\
  \ glacial lakes of Sangetsar, and scolding from a monk at the Tawang Monastery,\
  \ not necessarily in the same order of intensity.\n\n \nTony worked for 6 months\
  \ as a guide which was his \u201Cseason time\u201D. But he had to make a living\
  \ throughout the year. When he was not leading hikes or road trip groups (like us)\
  \ he leads bird-watching tours into the forest and forays into the forest looking\
  \ for silkworms. The region of north Arunachal was a hub for sericulture.\n\n \n\
  On our return journey, we stopped for the night at Dirang, which was Tony\u2019\
  s village. His family invited us for a meal at his house. We humbly accepted. Visiting\
  \ his home and eat a meal of pork broth and sticky rice, regaled by stories of his\
  \ valour by his parents had to be the highlight of the trip for us. We sat there\
  \ drinking some rice beer and listening to tales from their life in the mountains.\
  \ It was a wonderful experience, and we were so grateful to have them open their\
  \ home and hearth to us. We said our goodbyes not without a group photograph and\
  \ promises to stay in touch.  Phone numbers, postal addresses were exchanged and\
  \ Tony said that he would write to us once a month in English. He was just learning\
  \ the language in the last year and could stitch together a few sentences by now.\n\
  \n\nA journey to the Himalayas has always had a spiritual bend for me. I believe\
  \ that the road to the mountains leads you to special places in your heart which\
  \ are not often visited.\n\n \n\nWhile I returned to my city life after the trip,\
  \ deadlines, and twitter feed started filling up my mindscape. I would look back\
  \ at the trip to Arunachal fondly and also made a phone call to Tony\u2019s home\
  \ to wish Dorje on his tenth birthday. By the end of the month when we had already\
  \ moved on to planning the next holiday, a dog eared, a battered package arrived\
  \ at the office. Before checking the address I knew where this came from. Tony had\
  \ kept his rice beer-fuelled promise to write to us, in English, about his life\
  \ back in the mountains. And from there started a set of letters that we exchanged.\n\
