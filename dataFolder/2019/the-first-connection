Text: "An introvert photographer who loves to travelling into places, but he hates\
  \ himself for being the master of awkwardness when it\u2019s time to socialize with\
  \ strangers. Yup, that is pretty good to describe myself in a nutshell. If is there\
  \ any superpower I could possessed, it would be the invisibility. It\u2019s a joy\
  \ when I could walk in public by myself while listening to my favorite music and\
  \ taking picture of people like no one care.\n\nThere was a time when I was in Yogyakarta\
  \ and decided to take a shot of sunrise at Borobudur Temple. It\u2019s around one\
  \ hour away from the place I stay, so I need to wake up early in the morning around\
  \ 4 am. I put my jacket on, brought my camera bag and rode my rented motorbike against\
  \ the cold air. Once reached there, I walked up to the temple, looking for a good\
  \ spot to set my camera and wait for the sunrise. I was very happy because there\
  \ was no people around, and the sunrise? It was magnificent. Satisfied with my photos,\
  \ I continued to explore more places in Borobudur Temple until 11 am.\n\nDone with\
  \ my lunch, I continued to this place called Nglinggo Tea Plantation, the only tea\
  \ plantation in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta; It\u2019s located in the slope of Menoreh\
  \ Mountains at Nglinggo Village, Pagerharjo, Samigaluh, Kulon Progo. But before\
  \ I went deeper, I felt like to have a cup of coffee to energize myself before I\
  \ continue this journey. So I looked over the internet and see there is a coffee\
  \ shop called LOEGOE Coffee in this village. I was glad that I used motorbike to\
  \ visit this place, as the more you go, to more challenging the road will be. \n\
  \nFirst, the road was steep, narrow and no fence along the way up to the hill.\n\
  Secondly, my phone lost its signal! It gave me a hard time to found this coffee\
  \ shop by just following the map manually.\n\nWhen I reached this place, the shop\
  \ was still under renovation, retouching here and there, I thought the shop still\
  \ closed, but the owner personally greeted me and kindly asked me to have a seat.\
  \ The place surrounded by plants, trees and animal husbandry as I could hear the\
  \ cry of livestock from the back of the shop. The place was so peaceful, it was\
  \ a balcony with a table and 2 pair of chairs made by wood and I could feel the\
  \ gentle breeze came passing by while waiting for my coffee.\n\nHe came with an\
  \ empty cup and coffee carafe, while put them on the table, we start to getting\
  \ know each other. It was awkward for me, as at first I wanted to enjoy my coffee\
  \ by myself, but since there were only two of us, I can\u2019t help to talk with\
  \ him.\n\nHis name is Mr Koco and he is a son of a farmer, sincere and a dreamer.\
  \ He told me he could move to the city, get a job and start a new life there, but,\
  \ instead, he decided to stay at his village. Because he believes that Nglinggo\
  \ Village has a lot of things to offer. He pretty sure that all of the residents\
  \ able to manage the village, so they can gain profit together and have a better\
  \ life. Therefore he came up with his coffee shop where there is library and have\
  \ the internet installed, so people can gather and access the information they needed.\
  \ \n\nWait what? Internet? Yeah, Internet!\n\nI was very grateful to found this\
  \ place, had a good coffee, a friend but internet? Who expect the access to the\
  \ internet in the middle of village? I could download the map and continue my trip!\
  \ But the most important thing that I glad the most on that day, which I was able\
  \ to force myself to have a conversation with him. I am really proud that I could\
  \ be the best version of me so I could open myself to a stranger and make a connection\
  \ with him.\n\nWhile I prepared myself to leave, I asked him about the coffee, he\
  \ replied\n\nFriends don\u2019t pay"
