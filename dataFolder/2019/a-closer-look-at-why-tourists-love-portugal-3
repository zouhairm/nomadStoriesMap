Text: Aside from the obvious unique landscape, diverse and charming culture, I want
  to uncover why tourists love coming to Portugal. For me, Portugal was a destination
  I've always fascinated about visiting. I decided last year to just leap on a plane,
  and make my way down to Porto, Lisbon and eventually the Algarve Coast. What I didn't
  expect to see was the load amounts of tourists. So why do people choose Portugal
  as their travel destination? Is it because social media has exploited the destination
  and made us all feel like we needed to visit Portugal to avoid the serious FOMO.
  I mean I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case, but taking a deeper look I
  really think its because Portugal harvests and embraces its culture...and not in
  the tacky way you might be thinking. Yes, when we go to France we scavenge for croissants,
  escargot and whatever we think French Cuisine is all about. We know right away,
  okay I should see the Eiffel tower, the Notre dame etc...But when you visit Portugal,
  it's different. I don't think I've visited a country that is so unapologetically
  itself.  From the tiles literally everywhere, to the cuisine, and historical past,
  I want to ask travellers why they chose Portugal, over other popular European Destinations
  and most of all, i want to uncover the reason why Portugal is so popular.
