Text: "Between an espresso, a classic Hemingway piece, and a note carrying the weight\
  \ of the words \u201Cne m\u2019oublie pas\u201D I sat in a small coffee shop on\
  \ the corner of Rue de Rivoli and Rue Saint Martin. The words translating to \u201C\
  do not forget me\u201D tugged at my heavy heart and I found my thoughts stirring\
  \ along the River Seine back to that night. As far as first dates go, this one will\
  \ always be one for the books. Meeting him had been a lovely twist of fate and here\
  \ I was a 22-year-old, continents away from home, sipping ros\xE9 and my second\
  \ night in Paris away. As we tiptoed around the birthplace of ideas, education,\
  \ fashion, and art, eventually we found ourselves at the edge of Pont Saint-Michel\
  \ discussing mistakes, forgiveness, and the fragility of life.\n\n\u201CLife is\
  \ too short to be empty\u201D he noted, referencing the ink on his skin, a particular\
  \ moment of darkness, an empty bottle of pills, and the miracle that saved him.\
  \ He went on to narrate his childhood in one of the oldest countries in Europe;\
  \ his father leaving, friend\u2019s departing, the scars on his skin, struggling\
  \ to make ends meet, failed relationships, and an attempted suicide. He opened my\
  \ eyes to his world and it moved me. Even though we found common ground on the subject\
  \ of broken homes, I was dumbfounded by how much he had endured at such a young\
  \ age. Years later, he had found a silver lining by mending things with his father.\
  \ It became evident that he saw him for far more than the faults he had made and\
  \ the pain he left on his tracks. I began to understand that he welcomed everything\
  \ it meant to be human; to make mistakes, to learn from them, and to be better.\
  \ I came to admire his strength and his ability to forgive.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019\
  s your stance on second chances?\u201D he added, and my train of thought went to\
  \ a halt. \n\nIt was then that I realized mine had a flaw. I felt uneasy with my\
  \ own reality check. My stance on second chances was in need of some reflection.\
  \ While I had a plethora of second chances to give, deep down I still struggled\
  \ to extend another chance to my own parents. My problems could\u2019ve evaporated\
  \ into thin air and his could\u2019ve filled the entire river beneath us. In the\
  \ aftermath of all his pain, I could only find strength, kindness, and a light that\
  \ shined brighter. It dawned on me that Paris may very well be the City of Love,\
  \ but the City of Light seemed more fitting.\n\nSix weeks later his words echoed;\
  \ life is too short. The countdown to our end had a street name, a chill in the\
  \ air, a handwritten note, and a sudden goodbye. Perhaps seeing him fade through\
  \ the rear-view mirror down Rue des Lombards was actually foreshadowing an even\
  \ bigger lesson I had yet to learn and had since then stumbled between the scattered\
  \ pieces of our story. He kept the sweater I gave him, words we shared under Paris\
  \ and the rain, and the piece of my heart I left behind but I gained much more.\
  \ I found a different, better way to love and learned that forgiving was the only\
  \ way to let go. I embraced acceptance, growth, and more importantly, I saw life\
  \ through another\u2019s eyes. I came to believe that our love and the lessons we\
  \ shared didn\u2019t have an expiration date even if our story did. Eventually,\
  \ my espresso ran cold, I left Hemingway midway, and the weight of those three French\
  \ words lingered long after I crossed the Atlantic Ocean back home."
