Text: "When Lola and I stepped off the bus in San Jacinto, we thought there had surely\
  \ been some sort of miscommunication. The flyer she found in a travel information\
  \ centre in L\xE9on, advertising some geothermal mud pools and hot springs, led\
  \ us to imagine a crowded tourist destination. Instead, the driver let us off on\
  \ the side of the highway, seemingly in the middle of nowhere, bathing suits and\
  \ towels in hand.\n\nI had been backpacking Nicaragua with Lola for three weeks,\
  \ after several chance encounters in Honduras and Guatemala. It therefore seemed\
  \ fated for us to team up and travel together, for as long as we found ourselves\
  \ on the same path.\nIn this case, that path led away from the road, and as it appeared\
  \ to be our only option, we started to work our way down it, wondering if we were\
  \ heading to mud pools or just getting ourselves lost.\n\nAt the end of the road\
  \ we found ourselves at a ramshackle hut and a roughly constructed \u201Centrance\u201D\
  \ sign, comprised of a few pieces of wood nailed together haphazardly. A woman stood\
  \ in the hut while her two young daughters ran around playing. We paid the meagre\
  \ entrance fee, walked through the gates, and into another world.\n\nBefore us lay\
  \ a desert wasteland pockmarked with boiling, muddy geysers popping out of craters\
  \ in the earth like a terrifying game of whack-a-mole. On the horizon rose the majestic\
  \ Volcan Telica, a justaposition to the stark landscape before us. The girls guided\
  \ us through the frying pan fields with long sticks in hand, dipping them into the\
  \ mud filled craters as we choked on the sulphuric, rotten egg smell. We continued\
  \ through the fields for a short while, and when the mud on the end of the girls\u2019\
  \ sticks had cooled, we leaned in so they could paint our faces with the colours\
  \ of the earth.\n\nAs we prepared to leave this barren wasteland, no longer able\
  \ to stand the heat eminating from below with the hot sun beating down on us from\
  \ above, we bought a couple bags of mud from the girls, after which they guided\
  \ us down a small path. The girls laughed and played as they led us past tiny wood\
  \ huts with corrugated roofs, their owners smirking at the two mud faced girls wandering\
  \ through their town.\n\nAt the end of the path, we found ourselves at a tiny pool,\
  \ with a natural rock slide on one end and a small, rocky shore on the other. We\
  \ found a secluded place to change and slathered ourselves in mud. As we sat on\
  \ a boulder letting the sun bake the mud onto our skin, we watched the local children\
  \ competing fervently for the rock slide, as well as our attention.\n\nAfter the\
  \ mud had dried, we slipped into the pool, finding a shallow spot to sit and relax.\
  \ We kept feeling these tingles of something repeatedly picking at our skin, finding\
  \ it disconcerting at first, but eventually finding it relaxing. We soon found out\
  \ they were \u201Cnibble\u201D fish, and the odd sensation was them eating away\
  \ at our dead skin.\n\nAs the day wore on, we played in the pool with the sisters\
  \ while other children came and went. Near the end of the day, a local farmer brought\
  \ his herd of cattle to drink from the pool, bulls drinking from the water only\
  \ feet from where we played.\n\nWhen the late afternoon sun had tucked itself in\
  \ behind the treeline, we emerged from the pool, our skin aglow and satiny, and\
  \ the girls led us back, climbing trees to pull down fruit to gift us, and scouring\
  \ the ground for dead pacay \u2014 long flattened seed pods that resemble a boomerang\
  \ thats been straightened out, but sound like a rattle when shaken. We bought more\
  \ mud as we said our goodbyes to the girls, and headed on our way, joyous for having\
  \ taken a chance, and eager to make a habit of it."
