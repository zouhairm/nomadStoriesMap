Text: "I clenched to the seatbelt as hard as I could\nLeft foot was trembling, right\
  \ one wrapped in a cast\nFirst time flying \nHow does one calm a 7 year old 5000\
  \ meters above land?\n\nAcross oceans seas \nPast rivers and lakes\nBeyond desserts\
  \ and savannas\nOver hills and highways \nLittle villages and bustling cities\n\
  This ain\u2019t the Africa on the T.V screen\n\nThen came Harare\nBut it was too\
  \ dark to see\nToo late at night to witness anything out of the ordinary\nIt was\
  \ past bedtime anyway\nAnd, big plans I made for the morning ahead\n\nSoon came\
  \ the promised dawn\nThe sun peaked its head \u2018neath the horizon\nThere I stood\
  \ patiently absorbing its rays\nEven at that age, I knew true beauty\n\nChugged\
  \ down breakfast in a hurry \nSame old toast with apricot jam\nHarare got the essentials\
  \ as well (I remember thinking)\nUncle took us on a tour of downtown\nEverybody\
  \ was smiling\n\u201CSha-ma-re\u201D (\u201Cmy friend\u201D) - they would yell\n\
  It was a lively scene\n\nKids had freezes \nOld ladies sipped on chai\nShopping\
  \ bags were full of fresh veggies\nMelanin poppin\u2019\nNo sign of stopping\n\n\
  So we strolled \nWalked on neat sidewalks and through colorful alleyways off the\
  \ beaten road\nThis is what sweet dreams are made of\n\n\nThere I stayed for another\
  \ two months\nEach day brighter and better than the one before\nFun times filled\
  \ with laughter\nFun times they were\n\n\nHarare captured my heart \nInscribed on\
  \ it an indelible memory\nI can still hear it singing\nMy ears are ringing\nMy head\
  \ bopping to those Shona rhymes\nI smell Lizzie\u2019s pie from 05\n\nI\u2019ll\
  \ be back in no time\nCause deep down, I\u2019m hypnotized\nForever under Harare\u2019\
  s spell"
