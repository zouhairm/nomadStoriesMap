Text: "January 27th was the day I got to New York. As expected, I was hoping for the\
  \ trip of my life. I had never been abroad and did not know what I was going to\
  \ find in the Big Apple. More than what I found in and about the city, I was surprised\
  \ by what I found out about myself. \n\tWalking alone through Times Square after\
  \ having brunch in Queens (a delicious cheese sandwich and a vodka and something-pink\
  \ drink) with my brother, I had to rely on my GPS to guide me out of the luminous\
  \ street to find a small store to buy a parka to face the rainy days ahead. There,\
  \ at the store, I found a salesperson who could speak Portuguese and talk about\
  \ Brazilian music. They sold me a beautiful parka of which I am never going to let\
  \ it go, and they told me about cool things I could do while staying in the city.\n\
  \tOne of the things I wanted to do was to eat pierogies at a Ukrainian restaurant\
  \ and I went there on my first Monday night with a friend from India who lived in\
  \ Manhattan. They were exactly as delicious as expected, and the restaurant (Veselka)\
  \ was just like I had seen on TV. I also wanted to pay a visit to Strawberry Fields\
  \ in Central Park. I did so the next day, and I felt a different kind of energy,\
  \ as if my heart had found peace for a second and got back to reality. I met a group\
  \ of Brazilians there, they were kind enough to take my picture for me. I sat there\
  \ for a while, people-watching, and felt some kind of happiness, remembering my\
  \ favorite Beatles songs and feeling the cold air on my nose.\n\tI had Chinese food\
  \ at a restaurant I discovered close to my brother\u2019s office; he had no idea\
  \ about it, even though he had lived there for two years. I found out how different\
  \ it was compared to the Chinese food I had had back home; I ordered the same thing\
  \ I usually order in Brazil: beef and broccoli, but at this restaurant it was spicy,\
  \ and the portions were big enough to keep me going for a whole day. Walking through\
  \ the city alone was helpful in many ways. Not just following my brother\u2019s\
  \ steps everywhere was great, otherwise I would have only met the places he knows,\
  \ and it would have been a limited experience. \n\tIn two days I had walked through\
  \ the Natural History Museum and gone to the MET, and had a great time walking around\
  \ Midtown. When I took the ferry to Staten Island, listening to music, feeling the\
  \ cold air blow my hair, with the Statue of Liberty in sight, I realized that I\
  \ was more independent than I had thought. My brother was there only to open his\
  \ apartment for me at the end of the day, that was all he did. I had braved New\
  \ York City on my own.\nI ate, I drank, I walked, I saw art and artists in action\
  \ and I could not have had a better couple of days to discover part of a city and\
  \ part of myself. The city and I connected, but I did not expect to find that New\
  \ York would unveil my most independent side."
