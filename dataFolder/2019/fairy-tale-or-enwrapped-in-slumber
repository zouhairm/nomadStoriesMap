Text: "Every little girl dreams to be in a fairy-tale. Growing up, a person does not\
  \ believe in fairy-tales. But it turns out, a fairy tale is our life. A life of\
  \ adventure and breathtaking stories, with both funny and sorrowful tales. The reader\
  \ is now going to the journey, which began with a short story of a pretty girl K\u2026\
  .ia. Therefore, everything began in sunny Turkey.\nK\u2026.ia. did not believe in\
  \ fairy-tales, but then she believed in love. Love to life, Love of Peace, Love\
  \ as Love. Regardless of the difficulties in her life's journey, she remained herself.\
  \ So there she got on the plane and had a fly to Turkey firstly. The pacification\
  \ of Turkey turned everything in her head. The sea swirled her with its emerald\
  \ waves, and a happy smile on her face did not descend. All of a sudden, He appeared.\
  \ His curls rolled away in the wind, his eyes shone tenderness. K\u2026.ia plunged\
  \ into an unforgettable journey called Love.\nThe plane from Turkey landed in Russia,\
  \ but the feelings were dragged to where your second heart beat. Without hesitation\
  \ K\u2026.ia bought tickets to Romania. Months of waiting, alarming nights flew\
  \ by unnoticed. And here again, the plane flapped its wings to meet the adventures.\
  \ That stretched the Carpathians. Severe snow caps on the tops of the Carpathians\
  \ gave strength to K\u2026.ia. She fearlessly entered the Romanian lands. Proud\
  \ Bucharest met K\u2026.ia warmly. February was windy, but sunny. K\u2026.ia rode\
  \ by bus. Majestic buildings and friendly people gleefully glimpsed. But all this\
  \ was just the background. Heart and soul, warmed by love, carried her farther and\
  \ farther to him. The only one in whose eyes she was sinking. The long-awaited meeting\
  \ happened. She felt full of the joys of spring. But after the meeting parting was\
  \ again... A strange feeling overcame K\u2026.ia. She did not want to go home. Her\
  \ soul cried, playing the melody \xABCouple in a Cafe\xBB of Mikael Tariverdiev.\n\
  But then again K\u2026.ia with a brave heart did not give up. She saved up for tickets\
  \ to him, to Switzerland. Getting a long-awaited visa is about to be together again.\
  \ She is on cloud nine! However, K\u2026.ia did not know what awaits her ahead.\
  \ August has come. Oh, that smell. Yet summer, but the autumn smell is already felt.\
  \ Again, the airport and K\u2026.ia flew on wings to Switzerland. Everyone knows\
  \ that this is one of the richest countries, famous for its banks, chocolate and\
  \ cheese. But only not many know that this country also has a soul and heart. And\
  \ K\u2026.ia fell into the heart of Switzerland. K\u2026.ia happily greeted the\
  \ welcoming \xABGr\xFCezi\xBB in the town of the German canton. And it was a real\
  \ fairy tale. K\u2026.ia could not believe in this. Morning. Fresh air. Open window.\
  \ Alps. Cows are walking far away on a green meadow. Blue sky. Pigtail bread. Swiss\
  \ hard cheese and a slice of chocolate. When the heart is filled with love, what\
  \ else is needed for happiness to a person. K\u2026.ia got on a bicycle and went\
  \ to the mountains. She drove through small fabulously beautiful houses, happy children\
  \ waved her hand, and the blue canvas glittered in the distance. This was a crystal\
  \ blue lake. And above it rose the magnificent Alps. K\u2026.ia climbed the high\
  \ slope of the road, on which she drove for the past hour. Finally, she sat down\
  \ by the little fountain to drink pure water. At that moment came the deep insight\
  \ that happiness was here. It was unity with a beautiful country and culture. Around\
  \ silence. Around freedom. Even fluttering hawks in the sky proudly looked only\
  \ forward. At that precise moment, you understand that neither money, nor power,\
  \ nor people contribute to your happiness. Only primeval nature, its power and greatness\
  \ immerse you in an atmosphere of euphoria and peace. Only nature fills you with\
  \ true love. You start to appreciate every moment and all problems are forgotten,\
  \ turning into nothing, compared to the freshness of the alpine air. 11 days passed\
  \ quickly. Contact with the nature of magnificent Switzerland made me re-believe\
  \ in fairy tales. Thanks to him, beloved man A.pi. for the opportunity to see this\
  \ country of happiness. K\u2026.ia had to part with him. But the story of a broken\
  \ heart is another story. She is sad piercingly. Every cloud has a silver lining.\
  \ Now K\u2026.ia knows that a fairy tale exists. One has only to wake up from a\
  \ dream. A piece of Swissness culture stayed with her forever. If somebody meet\
  \ K\u2026.ia on his way, she will always smile at you. Smile more often! And your\
  \ fairy tale will become a reality.\nP.S. The status of a country is not that makes\
  \ it a country, but a culture that give a light, goodness, love for nature, love\
  \ for peace. Yours sincerely, K\u2026.ia."
