Text: "The Manchega were immediately distrustful of their unexpected guests, and were\
  \ not in the mood for all of the affection I was all but bursting to lavish upon\
  \ them.  They eyed us suspiciously before going about their sheeply duties, never\
  \ realizing the importance of their place in the collective imaginations of cheese\
  \ enthusiasts across the world.\n\nOne bold ewe with a challenging tilt to her head\
  \ stamped the ground impatiently, motes of dust puffing from the arid but fertile\
  \ land that makes up the plateau of central Spain.  She eyed us imperiously, bleated,\
  \ then pranced toward the cluster of her colleagues milling around the metal milking\
  \ stalls, signaling the beginning of a work day as clearly as the sound of a factory\
  \ whistle. In a region that stakes claim to the likes of El Greco and Cervantes,\
  \ these humble creatures are the driving force behind the ancient tradition of cheesemaking\
  \ found here.\n\nThese small but mighty beasts are the powerhouses behind one of\
  \ the most famous cheeses in the world, Queso Manchego.  Modern day Manchega sheep\
  \ are direct descendants of the creatures that have roamed this region for millennia.\
  \  This hearty breed evolved throughout time to not only survive, but to thrive\
  \ in this harsh climate.  Located in central Spain, just south of Madrid, modern\
  \ day Castilla-La Mancha includes the mountain town of Toledo, as well as the fabled\
  \ windmills of Consuegra.  Named al-mansha or \u2018waterless land\u2019 by its\
  \ medieval Moorish inhabitants as they settled throughout its ochre plains, La Mancha\
  \ is a land of atmospheric extremes: bone-numbing winters and fiercely hot summers.\
  \  \n\nIn the days since Don Quixote and his pal Sancho fortified themselves on\
  \ wine and this curdled treat (an energy-providing necessity when tilting at windmills),\
  \ a booming worldwide export and ever-increasing palate for Manchego has made this\
  \ the most famous food of the region.  La Mancha has long fed the human imagination\
  \ as well as the belly, banking on its bounty by producing enough cereals to keep\
  \ those windmills grinding, as well as ensuring the seemingly endless vineyards\
  \ keep pumping out lubricating libations.  Terrior, or \u2018of the earth\u2019\
  , is a term lifted from the wine world to describe the effect of the climate, soil,\
  \ and environment have on the flavor characteristics of a cheese; this never seemed\
  \ so quite so clear to me as when I stood in the quiet of the barnyard.\n\nThe pastures\
  \ of golden grains and grasses undulated around us as the breeze lazily lifted hay\
  \ and chaff from the gravel drive in ankle-high cyclones of copper colored dust.\
  \  Mere moments before stepping into the barnyard, we had toured the neighboring\
  \ creamery that churns out enough sheep cheese to feed much of the local and international\
  \ appetite.  The rustic facades of the town and the bucolic scenery of the outside\
  \ world, juxtaposed with the gleaming steel of modern equipment and cheesemaking\
  \ practices nestled inside seemed somehow representative of the zeitgeist of the\
  \ contemporary Old World.\n\nTo me, this is the magical dichotomy of Spain: history\
  \ here is not just linear\u2014it thrives all around you in the leavings of all\
  \ the cultures that have made the peninsula their own.  It is a way of life that\
  \ is only possible on this ground, on this plain.  From the time the first Bronze\
  \ Age Iberian herder poured curd into braided esparto grass forms, this culinary\
  \ artistry was considered worth preserving from one generation to another.  It is\
  \ now name protected and highly regulated to preserve this heritage for future generations.\
  \  \n\nThere is a romance to our favorite foods and the sensory experiences surrounding\
  \ them, and learning to tell their stories reminds us of where we came from.  There\
  \ is something special in the confluence of land and its inhabitants that creates\
  \ a certain type of magic from what could be basic sustenance. From the original\
  \ Iberian tribes, to the conquering Roman legions, to the hundreds of years of Moorish\
  \ inhabitants, to the modern Spain of today, the land around you tells the story.\
  \ Manchego is a shining example of a history and, if you\u2019re very lucky, you\
  \ can taste it and by doing so help keep 4,000 years of tradition alive."
