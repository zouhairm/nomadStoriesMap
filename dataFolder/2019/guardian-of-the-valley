Text: "After a whole morning of caves with Shiv Ling shaped stalagmites, and crawling\
  \ through tight, sour smelling caverns with hoards of other tourists and their chatterbox\
  \ guides, an unexplored cave tucked in little valley seemed like the breath of fresh\
  \ air we needed.\n\nI was on a road trip with two others in Meghalaya, in the north\
  \ east of India, and this part of the state drew tourists in hoards for it\u2019\
  s limestone caves and caverns. On a whim we had decided to abandon our main route\
  \ in search of this mysterious unexplored cave that we heard about from our waiter\
  \ at a small roadside eatery \u2013 unsure it it even existed.\n\nOf course, it\
  \ wasn\u2019t on Google Maps, so we had to rely on the slightly vague directions\
  \ he had given us. After about an hour of driving we were in the middle of nowhere.\
  \ Pulling up on a quiet hillock, we stepped out of the car to stretch our legs,\
  \ and reassess our expedition.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much around, except for a little\
  \ homestead in the distance, with a herd of cows grazing and two little girls minding\
  \ the calves.\n\nWe took a chance, with little hope for success. We asked the older\
  \ girl about a cave in the area. She pointed to wooden gate between a knot of bushes.\n\
  \nSkeptical, but in the mood for a walk anyway, we abandoned the car and proceeded\
  \ on foot. Climbing a bamboo ladder built over a log gate, and down the steep grey\
  \ gravel lined trail, we slunk carefully past thorny shrubs and stinging nettle.\n\
  \nFrom where we stood we could hear the soft gurgling of a stream. And as we drew\
  \ closer it became a gush and then a roar. A stream of this size flowing between\
  \ limestone hills meant there had to be a cave near by!\n\nThe homestead was far\
  \ behind now. There wasn\u2019t another soul around. Charged by the knowledge that\
  \ we had indeed found our unexplored cave, we marched on ahead, picking up pace,\
  \ crunching on the gravel, brushing carelessly past the nettle and thorny shrubs\
  \ and\u2026 Stop.\n\nThere he stood. Five feet tall, bulky chest slowly heaving\
  \ with each breath. An angry young bull. He had noticed us.\n\nHe gave us an enquiring\
  \ look, as if to ask how we dared to trespass through his valley. But after a quick\
  \ inspection he turned his attention back to the grass, as though giving us permission\
  \ to explore for while.\n\nRelieved, we sidled past him, and finally made it to\
  \ the stream.\n\nThe gushing stream slowed down as it flowed over sand and pebbles,\
  \ and then disappeared into the face of a rock. And there, over decades perhaps,\
  \ it had coaxed out a small cave in the limestone. This was it! Our unexplored cave.\
  \ We soaked it all in. Dipping our feet in the cold water and drinking from it,\
  \ as the sun, now lower in the sky, licked the top of the hill where our expedition\
  \ had begun. Before turning back, I picked up a few pebbles, polished by the rivulet,\
  \ as a keepsake.\n\nOn our way back, we met the bull again. Only, this time he was\
  \ a little more interested in us, and my bag of geological souvenirs. \u201CMaybe\
  \ he thinks it\u2019s food?\u201D one of my companions guessed, nervously. \n\n\
  But I had a feeling it was something else. In Meghalaya, the forests were places\
  \ of worship, and provided food and medicine for it\u2019s dwellers. But it had\
  \ no place for the greedy. Nobody was allowed to take away more than they needed.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but recall what our guide had told us in the Sacred Groves\
  \ the day before. The people of this region believed that the deities who protect\
  \ the forests and its norms often showed themselves in the form of animals.\n\n\
  I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, was the bull protecting what belonged to this valley?\
  \ As we crossed back over the wooden gate and made our way to the car, I clutched\
  \ the pebbles I had collected, with a pang of guilt."
