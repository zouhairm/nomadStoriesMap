Text: "A trip to a place you love is one of the powerful antidotes to the bleak feelings\
  \ that grow inside of one's self as a manifestation of a raging desire to embrace\
  \ freedom and break free from the chains of routine that enslave the soul. Going\
  \ to that place with your closest friends makes this escape from the worries of\
  \ life more enjoyable, especially for someone like me who was secluded from the\
  \ outside world for a long time. I had to be confined at home for an entire year\
  \ due to illness, swallowing pills and contemplating the gruesome walls that hindered\
  \ me from discovering the beauty of life. \n   \n  To celebrate my recovery, Amina,\
  \ Salma, and Ibtissam  decided to organize a trip for me to Rabat, a city with which\
  \ I have the dearest memories; memories evoking the naivety of adolescence, as I\
  \ used to fly in the sky of happiness when my mother would give me the permission\
  \ to go there with my besties. It takes forty minutes to get to Rabat from my hometown,\
  \ Kenitra by train. At the moment I set my foot outside the train, I took a deep\
  \ breath, for every cell in my body was in desperate need of new air.\nOn our way\
  \ to visit The Kasbah of the Udayas, we passed through Souk Alhed, a typical Moroccan\
  \ bazaar where traditional products of every kind and shape are displayed. This\
  \ Souk is the beating heart of the Ancient Medina as it is always crowded, day and\
  \ night, with tourists. Amina stopped by a shop selling Nouga, a Moroccan sweet\
  \ made of peanuts and honey, expressing her craving for it. We could not resist\
  \ this delicious sweet either. Therefore, we bought it. As Oscar Wilde said: \"\
  The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\"\nWe reached the main\
  \ destination in our trip, The Kasbah of The Udayas, after walking for thirty minutes\
  \ from the train station. It is a magnificent fortress, embracing the Atlantic Ocean,\
  \ which was built in the 12th century by the Almohads, an ancient Moroccan royal\
  \ dynasty. I felt connected to the place to the point that I thought for a moment\
  \ that it was talking to me. Every corner in this historical monument was speaking\
  \ loudly of the glory of those who built it. Its huge rust-colored walls protecting\
  \ its narrow blue allies reminded me of the picture of a mother protecting her children.\
  \ Indeed, this fortress was built to protect its inhabitants from the Iberian ships\
  \ which were threatening the western coast. As a visitor, you could see how much\
  \ the people residing there adore beauty. Every alley offers a spectacular sight\
  \ for the beholder, with flowerbeds put at the doorstep of every house. Not only\
  \ my eyes were satisfied with such beauty, but also my nose which was bewitched\
  \ by the amazing fragrance of flowers and plants.\nAs we grew tired of wandering,\
  \ we decided to take a cup of tea in a cafe inside the Udayas. It was probably the\
  \ same cafe in which the Almohad sultan and members of his court used to take the\
  \ same cup of tea and the same plate of biscuits we ordered. That's why we had to\
  \ pay 250 Dirhams to have the privilege of mediating with the glorious ancient proprietor\
  \ of the fortress! This is the only reason that came to my mind when I thought of\
  \ why we had to pay such a high price for a disastrous cup of tea, which has nothing\
  \ to do with the delicious Moroccan tea, and for the terrible biscuits that could\
  \ serve as an excellent food for albatrosses flying around.\n  Although  I have\
  \ been to Rabat quite a lot, I would never think of going to the Udayas as I was\
  \ haunted by the idea of experiencing aspects of modern life such as malls and fast\
  \ food. After this trip, I realized that my soul is looking for one place, a place\
  \ to connect with. It was the death in life experience that made me know that all\
  \ I want in my journey on earth is to be free and seek other new horizons."
