Text: "Filmy rays of sun filtering through cracks in the ramshackle roof momentarily\
  \ distract me from the distinct, acrid smell of chemicals and waste that waft and\
  \ linger uncomfortably in my delicate American senses. Glossy, recycled oil cans\
  \ stacked precariously and impossibly high glisten and glint. I am inside a dilapidated\
  \ warehouse, inside a humming slum the size of a small city, inside a region housing\
  \ one of the world\u2019s largest recycling industries. I am in Mumbai, India. \n\
  \nThe now-famous Dharavi slum, best known for its depiction in the film Slumdog\
  \ Millionaire, is a swath of contradictions and, depending upon the point of view,\
  \ is either a modern success story or congregation of strife and suffering. I feel\
  \ both awe and trepidation as I cautiously trail my local guide from NGO Reality\
  \ Tours out of an off-kilter, ramshackle structure into a labyrinth. \n\nOnly minutes\
  \ by train from the eclectic city\u2019s most affluent neighborhoods, the sprawling,\
  \ disjointed Dharavi slum encompasses 500 acres and is said to be home to approximately\
  \ one million people. A bustling hive of micro-businesses, with the slum\u2019s\
  \ recycling industry at its core, Dharavi\u2019s economic output is reported to\
  \ be close to $1 billion USD annually. \n\nEconomic opportunity in Dharavi is more\
  \ viable than most slums in India, yet the costs of slum-living remain constant.\
  \ The absence of, if not grossly neglected, infrastructure in the region pose serious\
  \ health issues to inhabitants. And these informal residents, some second and third\
  \ generation Dharavians, lack political power, educational opportunity and adequate\
  \ access to simple but critical life necessities like clean water and toilets. \n\
  \nIn comparison to the more calculated, Google-plotted neighborhoods of Mumbai,\
  \ venturing into the winding alleyways that crisscross haphazardly through Dharavi\
  \ is on the whole harrowing.  The journey is fraught with narrow alley twists to\
  \ navigate, waste piles to side step and electrified wires to evade.  \nAs I stood\
  \ resting during an intermittent pause, sweat trickling from suffocating humidity,\
  \ a cherub-faced girl, who looked about three years old, ambled out to a trash heap\
  \ in the pocket-size courtyard. With a stoic Mom looking on, the child maneuvered\
  \ jagged bits to a spot where her wobbly legs felt stable. She squatted and defecated.\
  \ \n\nI was at a loss for words, and, if I\u2019m honest, I was repulsed. Yet, I\
  \ knew I had experienced this scene from an American lens, and, as a Buddhist, I\
  \ knew I had to unpack this so that I could hold empathy and awareness instead.\
  \ \nMy world, which now seemed a million and one miles away, included sterile, easily-accessed\
  \ toilets along with abundant, fresh water for washing up. Thus, the stark contrast\
  \ of watching a child use a fetid pile of waste to complete what I considered an\
  \ intimate act was intensely unsettling. Yet, if I paid attention to my expectations\
  \ of what day-to-day life \u2018should\u2019 look like, that is, what kind of environment\
  \ I considered normal or even \u2018best\u2019, I could begin to close the divide\
  \ between my world and that of this little girl. \n\nWithout question, I would want\
  \ for her, and all Dharavi residents, to have basic needs met. But, in absence of\
  \ the ability to alter that in the moment, I had the opportunity to reconnect with\
  \ the child and her mother as humans. They may exist in a world distinct from mine,\
  \ and certainly sorely lacking in resources, but we share universal, habitual patterns\
  \ - a desire for love, fulfillment, connection and self-realization. \n\nAs I followed\
  \ and listened that day on a \u2018tour\u2019 inside the slum the size of a city,\
  \ I began to find this community had a lot to teach me about resilience, grit, patience\
  \ and ingenuity. The experience imparted new insight into the careful balance between\
  \ compassion and pity. That is, I can have a deep well of compassion for Dharavians\
  \ because of their life conditions which create hardship; and, I can also let go\
  \ of perspectives that dehumanize or diminish these (and all) human beings doing\
  \ their best to live their lives. \n\nI joined the tour to better understand a facet\
  \ of life in a developing country like India, and I left with greater humility and\
  \ an abiding and profound connection to the universality of human life."
