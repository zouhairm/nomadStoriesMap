Text: "They protested. They told me I shouldn\u2019t go. They told me I couldn\u2019\
  t do it alone. They implied that travelling, as a solo female traveller was the\
  \ worst idea I\u2019d ever had. But I couldn\u2019t stop daydreaming about watching\
  \ the sunrise over Angkor Wat in Cambodia. My mind would drift trying to imagine\
  \ the glory and the magnitude of the temples I endlessly Googled.  \n\nDespite the\
  \ word of caution from the ones I love most, I booked my first solo travel adventure.\
  \ The journey to Siem Reap was gruelling and customs took longer than anticipated.\
  \ After two long hours in customs, I walked out of the airport and looked for a\
  \ tuk-tuk driver sent by my hotel. I searched through smiling faces until I saw\
  \ it,  \u201CWelcome to River Bay Villa Joanna Dass\u201D. A man who was drenched\
  \ in sweat held the sign with the most forgiving smile, excusing me for my tardiness.\
  \ He took my backpack, which was practically the size of me, walked to his tuk-tuk\
  \ and we drove away. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting but there was a particularity\
  \ about Siem Reap. The midnight moonlight mixed with the streetlights gave me a\
  \ grim look onto the underdeveloped streets. As we drove to the hotel, I remembered\
  \ what had friends warned me about; that petty crime was common in Cambodia so I\
  \ gripped my backpack closer. When we got to the hotel, a staff member greeted with\
  \ a big smile and escorted me to my room with so much kindness. \n\nThe hotel, River\
  \ Bay Villa, seemed like an oasis. It was like I was the only person in the resort.\
  \ The hotel staff answered all my questions about Cambodia\u2019s past and really\
  \ helped me unfold what the Khmer people went through. I took the day to process\
  \ mentally the genocide and allowed myself to almost mourn with this resilient culture.\
  \ \n\nThe next morning Mr. Lay, my tuk-tuk driver, picked me up at 4:30 am and I\
  \ made the journey to the watch the sunrise over Angkor Wat. As I stepped out of\
  \ the tuk-tuk we agreed on a meeting point and off I went into the darkness to a\
  \ find a spot to watch the sunrise. I walked in silence and the only sound that\
  \ seemed to linger was the sound of mummers from the other tourists and the sound\
  \ of feet walking on the sand. This was it; I was walking towards a moment I anticipated\
  \ for months.\n\nI continued walking until I was met with at least a thousand others\
  \ but it didn\u2019t matter because it was like it was just me in the crowd of a\
  \ thousand. The chatter of the crowd seemed to drown out because there it was \u2013\
  \ the most famous temple of Siem Reap, Angkor Wat. The blues of the early morning\
  \ danced with the wisps of clouds. It was as though my very breath and heartbeat\
  \ found rest in its unsung song. Then slowly, the sun rose and with each passing\
  \ moment, I awoke. It was like I was transfixed in the present but also to the tragic\
  \ past of the Khmer people. My heart felt heavy yet very grateful.\n\nI spent the\
  \ next few hours walking. Okay, let\u2019s be honest baking in the sun as I roamed\
  \ in and out these massive temples. At Angkor Thom, the trees shoot out of the structures\
  \ almost asserting their force. It\u2019s hard to imagine how these temples were\
  \ built. How each brick and stone was laid and how the architecture still stands\
  \ today. The co-existence of man-made and God-breathed creation was a moving experience.\
  \ \n\nI hopped back into my tuk-tuk and we head back to the hotel. I hid behind\
  \ my sunglasses as a flood of tears flow. I now have no words to utter and I have\
  \ no thoughts to think. This place, it\u2019s history and its people have left an\
  \ imprint in my heart. I leave realizing that travelling solo, as a female traveller\
  \ was the best thing I\u2019d ever done for myself."
