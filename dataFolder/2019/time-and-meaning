Text: "I knew something was different as soon as I shut the door to our spacious taxi\
  \ van, loudly. I had just landed in Jeddah; a city that is the gateway for 2 billion\
  \ Muslims to the holy city of Mecca. Even though I was traveling with my uncle,\
  \ his family and my mom, without knowing why, I had this gnawing fear. \n\t\n I\
  \ looked inside the taxi, looking for something familiar I could connect with in\
  \ this foreign land and the only thing that the taxi driver owned in his space that\
  \ reminded me of something from my past were two words. \u201CAllah Akbbar\u201D\
  : meaning Allah is Great, on a sticker pasted on his rear view mirror. \n\nJust\
  \ when I thought I would puke from the smell of freshly peeled oranges that the\
  \ taxi wreaked of, we arrived at our much-anticipated destination. Mecca. \n\nThe\
  \ flood lights surrounding the black cube, the sounds coming from thousands and\
  \ thousands of people made the reality of the clock showing 3:43 am, a bit hard\
  \ to believe. \n\nThis place had a pulse, a rhythm and an aliveness: the kind of\
  \ vibrancy that our lives are expected to posses, daily. But wouldn\u2019t that\
  \ come from a context of one\u2019s beliefs: \u201CLife is a Gift\u201D or if \u201C\
  Life is a Test?\u201D \n\nThis pilgrimage, the beauty of this trip, the Kabbah,\
  \ all had been part of so many of my conversations while growing up in a Muslim\
  \ household. Now, as I stood in close proximity, it left me underwhelmed. \n\nJust\
  \ when I was beginning to get engaged and mesmerized by the speed of the wave of\
  \ people circling it, drawing a parallel to the speed of the planets orbiting in\
  \ the solar system.... my aunt nudged my shoulder and informed me that the security\
  \ guard is rudely asking us to not block the path. Just then, by a sudden jerk to\
  \ my body, I was swept away by my aunt, followed by my mom and other family members.\
  \ \n\nWalking away from the main hustle and bustle, my aunt realized that her ring\
  \ was missing its precious diamond. And I thought to myself, there is no way this\
  \ stone is going to be found amongst the thousands of feet hurtling on the floor.\n\
  \nWe had traveled so many miles from our home in the hope of adding meaning to our\
  \ lives, leaving behind our worldly possessions, making all that we left behind\
  \ mean nothing and to make this pilgrimage meaningful. \n\nNow, loosing the diamond\
  \ became part of so many conversations during the next few days. My aunt never gave\
  \ up looking for her diamond. She could hold both emotions equally strong throughout\
  \ the trip: duty and hope. \n\nShe would perform her rituals and after each ritual\
  \ pray to find her diamond which in my view was a futile exercise.\n\nOn the last\
  \ evening, I sat alone, watching the pilgrims, dressed all in white, circling the\
  \ House of God and wondered about Time, Purpose and Faith.\n\nAnd even though I\
  \ was supposedly in one of the worlds holiest of places, I knew I had brought with\
  \ me my age-old skepticism. Although one is supposed to be filled with renewed energy\
  \ and direction in life after this pilgrimage, I couldn\u2019t say that I had found\
  \ either of these.\n\nA week after our arrival back home, my aunt calls my mom to\
  \ tell her that she had found her diamond in the far corner of her handbag. I believe\
  \ all experiences leave their unexpected residue. In this case, this journey for\
  \ me, which started with fear and doubt, ended in Hope and Wonder."
