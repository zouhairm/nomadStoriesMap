Text: "We sped down the Bruce Highway in the north east corner of Australia, music\
  \ blaring, squinting against the bright sunlight and filled with a heady anticipation\
  \ about what the road ahead had in store. From the passenger seat of our newly bought\
  \ car, I leaned over and cranked up the air con. The tropical heat of Queensland\
  \ is no joke.\n\nFor the first time since setting off from Cairns a few days earlier\
  \ my boyfriend, Tom, and I turned off the highway in the direction of Stanage, a\
  \ little fishing village. Campermate reviews from fellow travellers assured us the\
  \ beach-side campsite was worth the 100-plus kilometres of lonely gravel road. An\
  \ hour passed. I looked out across the arid landscape, flat and dry as far as the\
  \ horizon. There was not another living being in sight, save a few kangaroos in\
  \ the distance.\n\nThen without warning, the engine cut out. The car slowed to a\
  \ halt. Tim tried to restart the engine, but it only whirred painfully. We popped\
  \ the bonnet and looked inside \u2013 nothing was smoking, nothing out of place.\
  \ And still, the car refused to start. After a while poking around the engine in\
  \ vain, we sat, grubby, hot and fed up, at the side of the road. There was no chance\
  \ of phone signal out here and dusk was falling. I felt panic starting to rise inside\
  \ me.\n\nWe had just about succumbed to the idea that we would be spending the night\
  \ there when a trail of dust appeared from the direction of the highway and, minutes\
  \ later, a truck pulled up beside us. I braced myself \u2013 rural Australians have\
  \ a reputation for being as coarse as the landscape they inhabit.\nA tanned old\
  \ man leaned out the window. We explained our situation and he offered to take a\
  \ look at the car in the morning. Did we want to spend the night on his farm, just\
  \ up the road? I hesitated, unsure whether to trust him. In the end, I realised\
  \ we didn\u2019t have much choice \u2013 it was either go with him or walk back\
  \ to the highway.\n\nThe old farmer, George, towed us back to his land and we slept\
  \ in our car. I woke at sunrise, bleary-eyed, to a cow staring at me through the\
  \ window, its face inches from my own. I wondered briefly if hooves were capable\
  \ of opening doors.\n\nGeorge was a widower and lived alone, with the exception\
  \ of a Jack Russell called Lucky, on a farm with a few cows, horses and a lot of\
  \ rusty machinery. While he and Tom fiddled with the car, I tried to make myself\
  \ useful around the house. \n\nWith the engine needing \u201Cfurther work\u201D\
  \ \u2013 it looked like they had pulled the entire thing apart \u2013 George insisted\
  \ we move into his spare room, where tiny geckos paced the walls. He told us to\
  \ help ourselves to anything in the fridge, including his healthy supply of beers.\
  \ He seemed glad of the company.\nTwo days turned into five. I learned to stop fighting\
  \ the relentless heat, instead adopting a Queenslander pace of life. The stress\
  \ of having a broken-down car melted away. With no phone signal to distract us,\
  \ we spent the evenings playing with Lucky and drinking beer on the veranda, listening\
  \ to George\u2019s stories of rural life. He had never left the state \u2013 he\
  \ was perfectly happy on his little farm in the middle of nowhere. For a pair of\
  \ keen travellers, it was a strange but refreshing perspective. \n\nEventually,\
  \ George concluded that the car couldn\u2019t be fixed by him, so he loaded it onto\
  \ the back of a truck and drove us to a mechanics two hours away. As we arrived\
  \ in the city of Rockhampton, the traffic and noise and busyness of regular life\
  \ seemed to engulf us. It felt louder and busier than it had before. \n\nGeorge\
  \ dropped us off and I watched as he drove away until his car had disappeared from\
  \ view. I was sad to say goodbye to him but grateful that our lives, so different,\
  \ had briefly intertwined. Now, if I ever get a bit frantic, I remind myself to\
  \ be a little more Queenslander."
