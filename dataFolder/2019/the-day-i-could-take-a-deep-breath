Text: "April 2, 2018.\nIt was 10:30pm and I decided to take a break of my work papers,\
  \ so I left my room in Gwangjin District and went to bridge of Han River by metro.\
  \ It takes me about twenty minutes to get there and when I did, with the cold giving\
  \ me chills I could look up the sky and saw that would start to snow and I decided\
  \ do not care about it and just joy the moment\u2026 turning my eyes to the left\
  \ I look at those big construction of blue metal that was holding the bridge and\
  \ me too. When I look down and saw a dark water (it seems like she was kissing the\
  \ moon) deep thoughts, like the height of river was passing my mind.\nI played \"\
  to my youth\" by Bolbbalgan4 and started to thought about the global overheating,\
  \ equality of genders and how I was broke (my money would feed me until the next\
  \ Monday and today is Friday). And suddenly my mind stuck in how I was tired of\
  \ everything and how my childhood was taken by obligations like \"you need to wake\
  \ up early! Go to school against our ways and make friends! Be sociable!\u201D But\
  \ after this period when we get older and have the same obligations as a kid everything\
  \ gets worse.\nAdults are mean and the littles still got compassion, they does not\
  \ judge just complain. Adults are basically the opposite, we take all the miserable\
  \ feelings and keep to ourselves, and we became a catalyst of our own sadness (I\
  \ know this term because of our lovely chemistry). I asked myself why my mind would\
  \ bring assumptions about me, when I am so irrelevant to the planet.\nI wish I could\
  \ yelling and asking to the water\u2019s reflection: \u201Cwhy I want to disappear?\
  \ Why the people, feelings, things in my life was not good enough? Why I am leaving\
  \ an autopilot and doing thing to others instead of for myself since my five years\
  \ old?\u201D and the answer comes in my eyes \u201CTHAT IS LIFE\u201D and I realized\
  \ why Han River has high scales of suicide in that bridge.\nIn the same way I was\
  \ there to take a break from my life and find a reason, people go there trying to\
  \ rescue the \u201Cfeeling of feeling something\u201D. It is a little bit literal\
  \ but we are all lost ourselves in the middle of the freezing water and drowning\
  \ in our thoughts. The river comes, goes and may give us what we are looking for,\
  \ but each person can interpret on them own way. Always be kind with the next, you\
  \ do not know by what kinds of bridges he or she is passing by.\nAn attitude can\
  \ be the answer that can bright or gets worse her/his confusion. Because we are\
  \ just kids learning to swim."
