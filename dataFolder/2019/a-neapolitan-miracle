Text: "I love soccer. I love going to the stadium, watching it on TV, or playing a\
  \ pick-up game with friends. I love it for the passions it unleashes and the generations\
  \ it unites, but mainly because I am from Argentina, where soccer marks the rhythm\
  \ of life.\n\nThis is a land where friendship is faithful and endless, but only\
  \ from Monday to Saturday. Sundays are reserved for the classics, like River vs.\
  \ Boca or Racing vs. and everything else is put on hold. It is a country where Peronists\
  \ and anti-Peronists have been fighting for decades, except for one month every\
  \ four Junes, when 23 argentines gather at a pitch somewhere in the planet, and\
  \ the millions of us embrace in the streets to watch with expectation, all resentments\
  \ left aside.\n\nFor us, soccer is culture. It is our way of understanding the universe.\n\
  \nIn 2015, I stayed in Naples for a month, a magical city located at the foot of\
  \ Mount Vesuvius, where the alleys are packed with scooters and every corner features\
  \ a comical example of the theatricality of the Italians. People in Napoli love\
  \ Argentines, and it is one man\u2019s fault: Diego Armando Maradona. As perfect\
  \ inside the field as he was questionable outside, in 1984 he arrived to Napoli,\
  \ a humble team with no championships on its records. He left seven years later\
  \ after winning two leagues, one Coppa Italia and one UEFA Cup, leaving behind a\
  \ city that had savored the taste of glory. \n\nStill today, many Neapolitans proudly\
  \ remember how in 1990, when Argentina and Italy met at the Napoli\u2019s San Paolo\
  \ stadium for the semifinals of the World Cup, they supported the foreign team,\
  \ where their idol was playing. Italy lost on penalties, but the working-class neighborhoods\
  \ celebrated until late in the night. Still today there is overpopulation of Diegos\
  \ among newborns.\n\nMy stay in the city marked the end of a long trip abroad. I\
  \ was almost out of money, sleeping in a seedy hostel and surviving on cheap paninis.\
  \ One day, I heard that Napoli would play the last game of the season against Lazio,\
  \ one of its most bitter rivals, and the winner would qualify for the Champions\
  \ League. It was a unique opportunity to visit the mythical stadium, but the tickets\
  \ cost a fortune.\n\nThere was only one chance.\n\nThat afternoon, I walk to the\
  \ San Paolo Stadium while rehearsing over and over one single phrase. At the entrance,\
  \ I showed the guard my passport and said: \u201CHi, I am an Argentinian traveler\
  \ who love soccer. I don\u2019t have any money, but I have always dreamed to visit\
  \ the place where Diego worked his miracles. Can I pass?\u201D\n\nThe man on the\
  \ yellow vest looked at me from head to toe. \u201CHe's going to tell me I'm crazy\u201D\
  , I thought. But then he winked at me, and answered:\n\n\u201CGo on. There is still\
  \ another checkpoint. Buona fortuna!\u201D\n \nTwenty meters ahead there were some\
  \ very tall turnstiles that only opened after inserting the entry ticket. An insurmountable\
  \ barrier. There too, however, there was another guard who was touched by my story\
  \ and asked the fan behind me to pass with him using the same ticket.\n\nI entered\
  \ the most amazing place I visited in my life almost as if I was sneaking into the\
  \ subway.\n\nStunned by my luck, I was walking up the stairs of the stadium, when\
  \ I felt that everything became familiar. The concrete mass vibrating to the rhythm\
  \ of thousands of people cheering and chanting; the sudden rush of adrenaline, my\
  \ heart beating faster and faster. More steps. Another hall. A corner. An opening\
  \ with so many lights, the shouting going louder and, finally, the stadium\u2019\
  s perfect oval before my eyes.\n\nAnd then I understood.\n\nThat Maradona and being\
  \ from Argentina were excuses. That Naples is another of those many places in which\
  \ the world stops every Sunday. That its people are also caught by a fever they\
  \ do not understand, a sacred ritual that make them kneel. That soccer is like a\
  \ universal secret language, like a warm embrace, like a song that brings one to\
  \ tears, and it simply cannot be explained."
