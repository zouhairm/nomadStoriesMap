Text: "Roughly 16 kilometres away from the bustling heart of the Spiti Valley, lies\
  \ Hikkim, boasting the highest post office in the world. The route from Kaza to\
  \ Hikkim is an arduous stretch- barely accessible through vehicles and mostly completed\
  \ by foot. Yet, this tiny landmark stands amidst troops of residents from surrounding\
  \ villages whose routines bring them together at this spot, every day, for a social\
  \ gathering. I had met a man there, Chunpa- friendly, educated and wearing a smile\
  \ brighter than the surprisingly bright whitewash of the post office. I hadn\u2019\
  t conversed with Chunpa much, but he had offered to click my photos with my three\
  \ best friends. It was another eight hour trek before we had found out that he\u2019\
  d be our host at the homestay for the next two weeks. I was 15 when I crossed Hikkim\
  \ on the way to Komick, the highest village in the world, and just as any intrepid\
  \ traveller who found themselves there, I had posted myself a letter.\nI discovered\
  \ the letter last year, amidst a pile of memories stacked and discarded in my room\
  \ as if I were intent on avoiding any form of nostalgia this little souvenir could\
  \ stir. Here it was, a thin parchment smeared with remnants of mud and monastery\
  \ incense- the smell intense enough to stir a desire to revisit home. \nIt was a\
  \ night in June, 2012. Our group of 23 travellers were settling in a hostel in Kaza,\
  \ a relatively unknown town tucked away in the Lower-Himalayan belt of Himachal\
  \ Pradesh. After a 16-hour journey in a van whose driver refused to entertain its\
  \ passengers with anything besides Tibetan music, we were daunted at the thought\
  \ for repeating this routine the next day. To make it worse, the hostel accommodated\
  \ only 18, and surprisingly I found myself with my three friends and the guide shipped\
  \ off to a dingy guest house on the other side of town. Yet, I insisted on turning\
  \ the night around- deciding to spend a first night away from home in a crammed\
  \ room with cobwebs and candles felt like a sinful act. Instead, we set out to explore,\
  \ aware that if we found ourselves lost in any nook or corner of this town, we\u2019\
  d be stranded there too shy to \u201Ctalk to any boy\u201D for help. Luckily, as\
  \ awkward and apprehensive as we were, we managed to locate a tiny gem in the heart\
  \ of the town- German Bakery. Disguised as a gourmet bakery in a town of dumplings\
  \ and thukpa, a narrow path unraveled the mystery of this gem, leading to a vibrant\
  \ hippie spot within. We weren\u2019t expecting to find ourselves at this cultural\
  \ crossroads, yet, amidst the Buddhists, the spiritual tourists and the non-conformists,\
  \ we understood why the guidebook we were handed at the bus-stop at Shimla defined\
  \ Spiti as \u201Ca world within a world\u201D. \nWe stuck to hibiscus juice for\
  \ the rest of the night, amused yet unwilling to experience the infamous liquor\
  \ Arak- an unsweetened, anise-flavored drink widely consumed in that region. Unfortunately,\
  \ our reluctance lasted a short while as Chunpa welcomed us in his homestay in Komick,\
  \ with Arak-flavoured thukpa (dumpling soup) the very next day. We gaped at Chunpa\u2019\
  s youngest son, 5-year old Tashi, who sat beside us on the earthen floor of the\
  \ single-room homestay and finished two bottles of the Arak before we were halfway\
  \ through our share of soup. Arak was more accessible than water in Komick which\
  \ sat at an altitude of 15,027 feet- with Tashi and Chunpa being one of the only\
  \ twelve families that resided there. My friends and I came from a different world,\
  \ but the peculiar yet inclusive and uncomplicated ways of this world was what made\
  \ it home. \nThe towns degenerated, so did the friendships. The valley was eventually\
  \ split apart by political turmoil while the four of us split on our respective\
  \ paths of life. There wasn\u2019t another option but to hold on to the letter,\
  \ mementos and most importantly, the memories, in order to revisit and to know that\
  \ no matter where I went after, the feeling that these memories stirred, were eternally\
  \ sacred."
