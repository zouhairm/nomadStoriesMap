Text: "I woke up to bustling noises, my nose titillated by the smell of yakisoba wafting\
  \ from the street. Such an occurrence wouldn't have surprised me were I in any other\
  \ place, but I was living in a share house in Jizo-dori, the Harajuku equivalent\
  \ for elderly people.\nDevoured with curiosity, I hurried to prepare myself and\
  \ check what is happening, as the street had never been that noisy since I came,\
  \ nearly a month ago. Jizo-dori was a quiet shopping street that all my friends\
  \ from Japan told me not to waste my time exploring. \u201CThis is a place for old\
  \ people and you are young\u201D, they said. An advice I religiously followed until\
  \ now, leaving early morning and returning late into the night. \nBut as I discovered\
  \ the spectacle laid before me when I started engaging into the main street, I immediately\
  \ felt that I would come to regret my choice.\nThe whole 800 meters of the shopping\
  \ street was totally invaded by street vendors. Food and clothes, kitchenware and\
  \ shoes: old and new goods painted the street in new light, totally transforming\
  \ Jizo-dori. The showa era looking buildings, crowned by the hustling of vendors\
  \ and the explosion of colorful wares, didn't seem that awkward anymore amongst\
  \ the skyscrapers of Sugamo, reminding the visitors of the glory days of Jizo-dori\
  \ as part of the main edo roads.\nOnce I observed everything and gobbled up one\
  \ (or three) konjac skewers, I headed to a little cafe to enjoy a red bean filled\
  \ bun, my favorite, when the old lady next to me actually smiled and asked me in\
  \ japanese: \u201CDo you like anko (red bean paste)?\u201D I nodded my head enthusiastically\
  \ in response as she smiled again and returned to sipping her tea, leaving me dumbfounded.\n\
  It was the first conversation any japanese person had initiated with me since I\
  \ came to Tokyo. My japanese, that I thought was decent, turned out to be very basic,\
  \ and english wasn\u2019t widely understood in Tokyo. It made the simplest task\
  \ of asking for directions a nightmare for me, not to mention trying to hold a conversation.\
  \ After numerous frustrating attempts, all proving unfruitful, I had simply given\
  \ up.\nThe Jizo-dori visitors continued to surprise me that day. A kind granny tried\
  \ to explain to me how to choose a kimono when she saw me looking forlorny at a\
  \ used kimono stall, although I had told her I couldn\u2019t speak japanese. A pouch\
  \ vendor asked me in broken english where I am from when he learned that I couldn\u2019\
  t understand japanese, further explaining to me that this was a kind of flea market\
  \ organized every 4th, 14th and 24th of the month. \u201CI will be here on the next\
  \ one with new goods so be sure to come!\u201D he added.\nI no longer felt like\
  \ returning home so soon, and lingered until the sun came down. Most of the vendors\
  \ were packing to go back when I saw a set of bowls that I liked and bought it.\
  \ Then, when I was about to leave, the lady at the stall, a women well into her\
  \ sixties, took one look at all my bags and handed me one big plastic one to put\
  \ everything in it.\nTo this day I cannot fully describe how she made me feel. Her\
  \ simple gesture overshadowed all the annoyance of clerks whenever I entered a shop.\
  \ Just like that, I completely forgot the dread I saw on the waiters faces everytime\
  \ I put foot into a restaurant.\nAt that moment, I realised that as others saw me\
  \ as a gaijin, middle eastern to boot, and treated me only as such, I had seen Jizo-dori\
  \ residents as old people, and modeled my behavior and interest according to that.\
  \ When in fact, those uncool boring elderly were the ones who had shown me the most\
  \ friendliness since I came.\nFrom that day on I resolved to explore all Jizo-dori\
  \ had to offer, including mouthwatering japanese rice crackers and sesame snacks,\
  \ a \xA5100 kind of shop where everything cost \xA51000 and the sight of the flashiest\
  \ grandpa strolling the street with his bejewelled bag and pointy orange shoes."
