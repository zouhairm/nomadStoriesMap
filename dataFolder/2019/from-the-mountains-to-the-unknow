Text: "From the cradle they called me Sami, I grew up among big and colorful corn\
  \ crops, fat and strong cows grazing, roosters that as usual every morning played\
  \ the role of alarm clock, pigs that I adopted as my pets and fields full of fruits\
  \ from mother earth.\n\nAs a child, my grandfather always told me stories about\
  \ how the world could be beyond my beloved mountains and the smell of the vegetable\
  \ soup that mom cooked. He always said that behind those mountains, he harbored\
  \ a monster called knowledge, and that one day I should go there.\n\nEvery night,\
  \ and when my family said goodbye with a kiss, I opened the curtain and saw the\
  \ moon shone in the distance, feeling there was something I wanted so much to discover\
  \ someday.\n\nWhen my grandfather died, he told me that the trick is to always have\
  \ a backpack at the door because you never know the day that one will leave a place\
  \ to go to another; and finally that day arrived, I took my bags and embarked on\
  \ a trip that I would not know it would never have a return.\n\nOnce decided, driven\
  \ by my grandfather, I started my journey to the city and I marveled at so many\
  \ things that it offered and that I was only aware of its existence because of the\
  \ books I read once; among them I remembered a phrase of Einstein: \"The mind that\
  \ opens to a new idea, never returns to its original size\", and so it was.\n\n\
  My heart pounded with every step I took in such a huge city, full of tall buildings,\
  \ people dressed in many shapes and colors, the sound of traffic, and the smell\
  \ of hot chocolate coming out of a nearby caf\xE9; all this, made me stop for a\
  \ moment in a square, to see and feel the movement of the world, generating in me\
  \ an even greater curiosity when I saw in the sky a huge bird called an airplane\
  \ that passed very close to me.\n\nA few days later I took that majestic machine,\
  \ which they say connects some lands faster with others and while I was watching\
  \ from above my beloved mountains, I knew that the time I spent with them was valuable,\
  \ but I had to grow. After all, life is too short to be lived in one place ...\n\
  \nI felt that I did not grow from the earth to follow a straight line; like the\
  \ roots, they forge lines in several senses that give life to wonderful plants,\
  \ and I had to be one of them.\n\nTraveling shakes the stomach, because it is synonymous\
  \ of love. It excites you since that huge bird opens its wings, until it lands,\
  \ and continues with each step you take as you explore each corner of each new horizon\
  \ that your heart beats in front of you, and you do not feel like a superhero, until\
  \ you discover that your destiny was to be there, and it feeling puts a real meaning\
  \ in your name. Sami: \"Lucky, successful, and happy woman\"."
