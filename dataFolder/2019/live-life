Text: 'I studied abroad in Australia a few months ago. I never felt so alive. For
  six months I felt like I was where I was supposed to be. I felt loved for the first
  time in my life. I had friends for the first time in my life. I am from the middle
  of Canada. The population is low. It is so cold for most of the year that it keeps
  you from leaving your house. There aren''t many jobs. People have conservative hopes.
  I met people who inspired me. I have been inspired before that was nothing new.
  But I felt for the first time that I inspired someone else. I learned that I could
  be a person who was whole even if I didn''t have my life together.I learned what
  it meant to be poor. Living in a room with a bed and a table for horrific rent.
  Going out for a meal one a month and having to fast for days to make up for it.

  And I met the one as they say. And he stayed in Sydney and I had to go home. And
  no one in Canada will ever know he existed. He will never meet my grandpa. He will
  never sit at the dinner table. He will be like a ghost to me now. Maybe I will meet
  him in Germany. But he is always moving. And he is so completely loveable and adventurous.
  He will be swept up into something. I would never be able to hold him down nor would
  I want to. I have been home two months and it is such painful bliss to remember
  him and the places we saw together. But I wouldn''t change a thing. What is the
  point of life if you don''t live it.'
