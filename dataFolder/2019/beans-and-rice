Text: "\"Congratulations your trip is finally confirmed. Now if there are any questions...\"\
  \ the well scripted words of the travel rep, suddenly faded into background noise\
  \ as my mind began to wonder, endless fantasies about my new venture. It was really\
  \ happening. After weeks and weeks of research and narrowing down destinations,\
  \ Costa Rica, was really happening. Just a couple of months later I was waving goodbye\
  \ to my overly eager parents in the Queens Terminal. Surely just over 15 hours of\
  \ travelling alone can't be too bad? Surely thats more than enough time to collect\
  \ my thoughts, stay calm and prepare myself for this new experience. \nOf course\
  \ being only 18 years of age and travelling alone left me on the receiving end of\
  \ many funny looks from airport staff at border control. Were these signs that this\
  \ were a bad idea? Possibly working in Costa Rica wasn't for me. Was it too late\
  \ to turn back? Maybe this leap into the unknown was a step too far this time. Fifteen\
  \ and a half hours, a heap of terrified phone calls home and a ridiculously intimate\
  \ stop and search in Newark airport later my flight had landed in San Jos\xE9. \n\
  After a night in a stuffy dormitory I was escorted to my in country orientation\
  \ where prior to arrival I had already learnt my first two major lessons about Costa\
  \ Rica; 1-American dollars are essential (why did nobody educate me on this), 2-My\
  \ GCSE Spanish skills were not sufficient enough to help me get by.  Imitating an\
  \ eager year 7 with an oversized rucksack, I found my way to the bus station, with\
  \ a note in Spanish to hand to the second bus driver, ensuring I arrive at the correct\
  \ destination. Higher and higher we climbed in the small 1970's American styled\
  \ bus. When the driver signalled to me that it was my stop an overwhelming state\
  \ of confusion consumed me...I was on a hill in the middle of nowhere, with the\
  \ force of the thick humid air combined with the weight of my bag almost tippling\
  \ me over. But somehow, the rapid series of constant flowing chirps between the\
  \ exotic birds, hidden amongst the most vibrant shades of green was soothing. I\
  \ felt at home. Almost every single inch of nervousness and regret left my body.\
  \ I knew working in Costa Rica was about to be a dream come true. \nUp and down\
  \ the hill I marched in search of what was to be my new workplace, to my left the\
  \ jungle and to my right a never ending row of tin houses each decorated to their\
  \ own delight. Not a person or clue in sight, yet I eventually realised I was right\
  \ outside the animal rescue centre all along. A warm central American welcome, followed\
  \ by my eager purchase of the most chocolatey ice lolly I could spot, was the beginning\
  \ of a life changing experience. \nAssuringly Maria who seemed like the mother hen\
  \ of the group took my bags and showed me around. I was in awe. Greens, vibrant\
  \ reds, oranges, pinks blues, colours the rainbow fails to show us exist. Trees\
  \ taller than I have ever seen before towered over us, the jungle, really was an\
  \ attack on my senses. The humidity pressed against my skin, the piercing sound\
  \ of the playful monkeys danced around me, with each corner turned I was exposed\
  \ to a new beautiful creature I knew I would begin to fall in love with, and of\
  \ course post five minute torrential downpour that left my clothes clinging tightly\
  \ to me, I began to get hints of the pleasant petrichor.\nTowards the end of the\
  \ tour I came alongside the big cats, in particularly perched myself outside the\
  \ cage of an ocelot. It's piercing beady eyes caught with mine as it slowly creeped\
  \ to face me. Being so close to such a beautiful animal reminded me exactly what\
  \ I came to Costa Rica for. A dream I had held onto since a child, Costa Rica had\
  \ given me the pleasure of living. My leap into the unknown no longer felt like\
  \ the unknown...it was home."
