Text: "I walked in the streets to avoid the men on the sidewalks. Gentle puffs of\
  \ hookah smoke held rhythm with their thoughts. They unclothed me with their eyes.\
  \ Sometimes, they left their languishing ennui to trot behind me in the filth-strewn\
  \ dust. The chase was an awkward dance to avoid the swerving drivers distracted\
  \ by my flaming blonde hair. \n    I would sigh and pull my scarf into a hijab.\
  \ \n    Each day, I exposed myself whole-heartedly to the complexities of Morocco.\
  \ Each night, I wrote. Sometimes my writing was fueled by whimsy or wrapped in love.\
  \ Some nights, it wasn\u2019t\u2026\n    My study abroad quest was to understand\
  \ the marriage between traditional medicinal practices and Western psychiatry. Bipolar\
  \ and schizophrenia were the only designated mental illnesses (in 2010), sexual\
  \ assault was ignored (against both girls and boys), and suicide was flat-out denied.\
  \ I wanted to know the herbs that the wise women in the medina, with their Tamazigh\
  \ chin tattoos, would prescribe for what I recognized as depression and PTSD. \n\
  \    To find these answers, I skipped through the modern hamriya, past caf\xE9s\
  \ and supermarkets, or threaded between ancient walls in the twisting medina as\
  \ vendors trumpeted their wares. Only one word quelled intense gazes and following\
  \ footsteps.\n    Hshuma...\n    Shame. It held the power to shut down immoral thoughts.\
  \ My stalker would disappear into the rowdy day-born crowd or behind mosques gracing\
  \ the night-bruised skyline. \n    If he was particularly lustful, the kindness\
  \ of Moroccan women was fail-safe. They, too, admired my hair, with a wistful or\
  \ curious look, touching the golden tendrils while whispering comfort and barking\
  \ admonitions at the men. \n    This dynamic was a rarely spoken about power the\
  \ women held.\n    Many feared their man and protected his honor, but there was\
  \ a bold bond to defend against the unknown others. I volunteered at a clandestine\
  \ Women\u2019s Wellness Center, where we assured women that asking for help was\
  \ not a sin. They faced physical reprisal from their families if they came forward\
  \ with the truth of assault. We gained their trust, conducted art therapy, listened\
  \ as they ranted, and held them as they cried. Working in the Center and walking\
  \ in the streets, I became infuriated at skewed interpretations in the beauty of\
  \ Islam and the identity-damaging paradigms of rural ignorance and Western imperialism.\
  \ \n    My hopes to discover the country\u2019s magic evaporated after I was violently\
  \ assaulted. My long-diagnosed bipolar disorder was triggered and anxiety roared.\
  \ After the attack, I escaped to France in tears. After two months in a supposedly\
  \ progressive Islamic country, seeking to learn and love every experience, I imploded.\
  \ It was a physical shift in spirit. A rural city where alcohol was the most expensive\
  \ commodity was not a normal choice for American students. I was one of the few\
  \ who sought to understand the clashing cultures around me, when, unfortunately,\
  \ the ruthless, backwards, violating psychopathology of the worst men finally stole\
  \ my spirit. \n    Marseilles was a welcome respite. I raged. I danced. I drank.\
  \ I devoured chocolate and charcuterie. I released all the wearying frustration\
  \ and the very legitimate pain I carried. It felt like home. However, my last day\
  \ there, the hostel host reprimanded me for giving a homeless man my leftover dinner.\
  \ A swift shift of spirit once again ensued. Countless times, I had witnessed my\
  \ beloved Moroccan classmates give food from their own plates to passersby. That\
  \ absolute benevolence to one\u2019s neighbor had become a piece of me. I cried\
  \ all the way back to Morocco, its warm embrace saturating my soul. A different\
  \ type of home. \n    Many of the women in the Center had undergone experiences\
  \ like mine\u2014or worse. I hadn\u2019t expected to find solace in the same place\
  \ where I offered my care and concern, but they extended their compassion without\
  \ question, gaining my trust, teaching me there is no shame in surviving. \n   \
  \ This message of love still pulses in my ears, the way sitar music vibrates the\
  \ centuries-old red walls I was lucky to brush with my heartstrings and fingertips\
  \ during my daily medina escapades. The country offers hope, despite the triggering\
  \ violence. The strength of women and the alliance of good men can be transformative:\
  \ a resistance against the hshuma."
