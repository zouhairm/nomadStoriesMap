Text: "Years ago, I worked on construction. Thereby, I met this guy from Georgia,\
  \ his name was Mischiko. Meanwhile, I studied in Istanbul. I wanted to discover\
  \ the politics, the culture and the nature of the whole country. I was planning\
  \ a longer trip through the east of Turkey, Georgia and Armenia. This time, I remembered\
  \ Mischiko's invitation to Georgia. Often, people just say so, but I would ask him\
  \ and I would visit him there. I gave him a call and we just started to plan our\
  \ journey. At the end, I had an intense trip, full of hospitality, new memories\
  \ and georgian chacha boose.\n\nAnd now, I go there again. I chatted with a girl\
  \ from Georgia on Couchsurfing. After a while, she invited me to Tbilisi, her hometown\
  \ and the capital of Georgia. Soon, I saw me sitting in the expressbus from Kutaissi\
  \ Airport to Tbilisi. I was a bit nervous and she seemed it too. By car we got to\
  \ her place and she prepared a really fine meal. We understood each other well.\
  \ Her dad worked as artist in Germany and during her visits there she could practice\
  \ German.  Indeed, I did not just mean the language, but also the body language.\
  \ Which is often much more important. We kissed and we planned the next days. \n\
  First, we went to Bakuriani, a ski ressort in the mountains in the region of Samtskhe\u2013\
  Javakheti in the south of the country. Unfortunately, almost without snow. Good,\
  \ since I do not like skiing anyway. We walked through the mushy snow and enjoyed\
  \ the wide sky at night. The next day, we found this small restaurant in the center\
  \ of Bakuriani. It was not necessarily the flashing decor, that attracted us but\
  \ the traditional cuisine. By this, I could try several dishes, such as soups and\
  \ Khachapuri - a warm cheese-filled bread. Afterwards, we took the Kukushka to Borjomi,\
  \ a popular spa not too far from Bakuriani. By this narrow-gauge train, so-called\
  \ Kukushka, it took us longer, but it was definetly worth it. On the way to Borjomi\
  \ we experienced dense coniferous forests and impressive views. There we drunk the\
  \ well-known water from the springs and took a minibus Marshrutka to the village\
  \ of Atskuri.\nHer family gave us a warm welcome. The stove burned and the food\
  \ was prepared. I wanted, but I was not allowed to help. Thereupon, I tried to communicate\
  \ with her grandma and her uncle. We somehow found a way, with some Russian, Georgian,\
  \ English, hand and feet. The food was really delicious - all home-grown vegetables\
  \ from their own garden and their animals. Before every shot, there was a toast.\
  \ Once to the country, once to  the men, once to the women, once to the uncle himself.\
  \ \nI surprisingly awoke without a headache. Anna and I decided to strowl through\
  \ the village. Atskuri lies along a section of the ancient Silkroad, between the\
  \ towns of Borjomi and Akhaltsikhe in the south of the country. Archeologists suppose\
  \ that people settled here in 1700 BC. Furthermore, the village hosts a signficant\
  \ Cathedral and the 1000 years-old Atskuri Fortress. We went there. Therefore, we\
  \ had to climb up the mountain through a tunnel, which was former used by locals\
  \ to bring in safety. From the castle we had a stunning view of the Kura river,\
  \ the valley and the village. On the way back an elderly man invited us and thereby\
  \ we discovered a former hamam, a turkish bath house and we both thought of revitalizing\
  \ it. \n\nA few days later, we were on the way to the airport. She brought me in\
  \ her red car. She wanted to speak, I wanted to be silent. The farewell was difficult.\
  \ I remembered all the people I had watched at stations and airports. I was always\
  \ amazed concerning their emotions. Now I was one of them myself. \n\nI'll fly back\
  \ soon."
