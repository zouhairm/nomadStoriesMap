Text: "Travel. Traveling. Traveler. This words have been the most mentioned in my\
  \ Instagram posts and hashtags. I do remember the first time I started something\
  \ they called \"traveling\". I have no experience about being a traveler, no idea\
  \ of all those terms I now use very frequently. At that time, I was just graduated\
  \ from University, got my bachelor degree in Pharmacy, and all that I can think\
  \ of my life in the future is a room with lots of chemicals and instruments or series\
  \ of drugs to be prescribed to the patient. \n\nIt was started by a very sudden\
  \ and impulsive decision from me and my very fist travel-mate that bring us to a\
  \ journey to one of the cultural city in Indonnesia, Yogyakarta. It was only 2 days\
  \ left for us to prepare everything. Yes! Everything. We both ended to sit in a\
  \ train, without knowing what kind of train we took. Without an itinerary. Without\
  \ any rooms booked. Without maps, at that time, Google maps was untouchable for\
  \ us and the worst thing is we didn't prepare the printed version at all. In conclusion,\
  \ we went without any preparation.\n\nThat journey took me 600 km away from home.\
  \ Arrived in Yogyakarta about 4 o'clock, very early in the morning and very tired\
  \ of our trip with a no-air-con train and cigarette smoke from the other passengers\
  \ all night long. I felt so wrong of doing this spontaneous journey and now we have\
  \ to look for a place to stay, to keep us safe for 3 days ahead. We were student\
  \ at that time, we had very limited budget, all that we had was a train ticket back\
  \ home. Not enough with the bad experiences, we chose an absolutely wrong time to\
  \ visit Yogyakarta. Meanwhile, almost all the city was preparing for their very\
  \ first day of Ramadhan fasting season, we went to a far away beach in the southern\
  \ part of the province. We took a public bus to get to the beach with some villagers\
  \ went to the same direction with us. They brought lots of bags filled with food\
  \ supplies that could stand for the whole family for 2-3 days. The beach were welcoming\
  \ us with a very heavy wind, wide open shore and unusual scene. There was literally\
  \ no one there, no visitor, no food stall, no merchant selling gifts or beach-suit,\
  \ it was only me and my travel-mate who were thinking of playing at the beach in\
  \ the very first day of fasting. That was not reaching the climax yet. We still\
  \ tried to enjoy by ourselves, so then we played with the wave (Note: a very strong\
  \ and high wave). The wave was extremely strong but still we thought that we can\
  \ swim in that beach and so that was the thing that we did. And now, coming to the\
  \ most remembered experience we had. A very big and strong wave came to us and dragged\
  \ my travel-mate further from the beach. She couldn't control her move and I was\
  \ too far from her. Thankfully, there was a huge rock near her that caught her and\
  \ helped her to get back to the shore. She bleed her legs, hands and some other\
  \ part of her body, but still we were thankful of having each other safe and sound\
  \ after such an unwise decision. \n\nSurprisingly, after all of those bad memories\
  \ and experiences, the good news from that journey are: I (and my travel-mate) continuously\
  \ travel to many places.. Some times we have each other as companion, sometimes\
  \ we do solo traveling or with other travel-mates that we have. That journey begins\
  \ a life that I love so much. The life I hadn't been dreaming of but I finally realized\
  \ the adventurous side of me. The journey that inspired me to be brave and to be\
  \ more confident of not only myself but also others, strangers and their unexpected\
  \ kindness. The journey that encourages me to give my self a little surprise, going\
  \ to the unknown with or without plans and accepting that life is definitely full\
  \ of surprises, come to us in a good and worst experiences!"
