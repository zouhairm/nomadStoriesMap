Text: "Excited like a child, constantly staring through the airplane window, as soon\
  \ as I first set my eyes on the mighty Bosphorous, it seemed like a place with history,\
  \ like it had seen a thousand civilizations thrive and collapse on it. A place fit\
  \ to wage wars and to conquer kingdoms; it is nestled in the middle of Europe and\
  \ Asia, separated through the river Bosphorous, and has the European subcontinent\
  \ on one side, and Asian on the other. Crossroads of civilization, a place where\
  \ the east meets west, no wonder it is such an amalgamation of culture. \n\n   Batur,\
  \ our taxi driver cum tour guide for the trip, waited anxiously at the arrivals\
  \ gate holding our nameplate. Merhaba Bayan! (Hello Madam!) Welcome to Istanbul.\
  \ We greeted him enthusiastically, and boarded his car. A middle-aged man, Batur\
  \ loved to talk. Of course it was a part of his job, but he instantly made us feel\
  \ comfortable and I felt grateful that we had such a cheerful person with us to\
  \ show us the city. As we took a short break to grab a bite, Batur informed us that\
  \ in Istanbul it\u2019s the month of Ramzan. Clueless, I ask him what it meant.\
  \ Not that I hadn\u2019t heard of it, I never really had a chance to speak about\
  \ it directly to a muslim. Being a Hindu from India, it has always been a big deal.\
  \ The tension between the two cultures is rampant. Its interesting how borders immediately\
  \ start melting once you decide to unlearn the whole prejudice given to you by the\
  \ society you grow up in. One feels ashamed of how narrow one\u2019s worldview can\
  \ be. We choose to stay in the cocoon of belief system that is not even ours. He\
  \ explained, how muslims allover the world observe a month long fast and abstain\
  \ from food and any sinful behavior after sunrise until sunset. They can consume\
  \ food only before the sunrise and then can break their fast only after sunset.\
  \ Even drinking water is not an option. I was in awe of his earnest demeanor, his\
  \ devout faith, yet his ability to be so surprisingly modern and tolerant. That\u2019\
  s the thing about a place like Istanbul, a place that has been a melting pot of\
  \ so many cultures in the past; that one can simply be. The best part is, under\
  \ the blanket of our prejudice, we never expected to arrive in such a hip, modern\
  \ and clean city and thankfully, we were surprised.\n\n    Enthusiastically, I decided\
  \ to accompany Batur the next morning to his trip to the mosque, where he was to\
  \ first consume his meal for the day, \u2018suhoor\u2019, followed by a prayer to\
  \ Allah. At 4 am in the morning, we arrived at the grandest mosque only after the\
  \ great mosque of Mecca, the 'Jamah Sultan Ahmed' or the Blue Mosque. Some places\
  \ are beautiful and some are even beyond the conventional definition of beauty.\
  \ Truly beyond words, the blue mosque is certainly one of those places. As I saw\
  \ a swarm of happy people consuming their first and only meal for the day, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but wonder, are we being too hard on one another? Are we all really different\
  \ from each other at all? Or is it just the fact that we feel so comfortable in\
  \ our small world, that we fear the unknown? We simply create borders and label\
  \ anybody unlike us as the \u201COther\u201D. Aren\u2019t we all simply human! Musing,\
  \ I spent my day eagerly waiting for the evening when Batur would be able to end\
  \ his fast for the day, at the time of \u2018iftar\u2019. With the evening azaan\
  \ playing in the background, Batur got ready to end his fast awakening excitement\
  \ in us as we eagerly awaited him to consume a proper meal. With the azaan, the\
  \ atmosphere was serene only being interrupted by a wailing child sitting on the\
  \ next table that Batur pacified by offering his first morsel."
