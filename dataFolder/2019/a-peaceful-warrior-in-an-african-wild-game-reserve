Text: "It\u2019s the last night of our African Safari and we share conversation while\
  \ enjoying a relaxing evening at our lodge.  Gazing into the glass of my signature\
  \ cocktail - Gin and Tonic- I become mesmerized by the dancing bubbles bursting\
  \ to the surface while reliving events of the past few days\u2026\n\nOur jeep is\
  \ stopped on the roadside as a large elephant herd crosses the road towards the\
  \ watering hole.  Bursting clouds of dust form with each step as they affectionately\
  \ touch each other with their trunks. The joyful, bouncy stride of these baby elephants\
  \ with flopping ears and springing noses force a giggle of joy.  Snapping photos,\
  \ I am interrupted by a ferocious trumpeting sound from the matriarch. Her status\
  \ is evident because she is a giant, in the midst of giants.  Her large open ears\
  \ effectively demonstrate her authority as she stares at us with intense eyes filled\
  \ with wisdom and responsibility.  The message is clear; \u201CBACK OFF\u201D she\
  \ demands.  Excitedly, yet calmly, our guide instructs, \u201Cdon\u2019t worry,\
  \ she\u2019s just warning us\u201D as he slowly reverses the jeep. Standing her\
  \ ground until satisfied with our retreat, she lumbers away to the others. \n\n\
  The happy voices of my traveling companions pull me away from my reverie.  \u201C\
  What was your favorite experience?\u201D  I ask.  \u201CSeeing the wild dogs and\
  \ their pups\u201D is an immediate response.  African wild dogs are endangered with\
  \ less than 5000 alive today.  The pups are barely old enough for guests to observe.\
  \  Two adults are lounging in the early morning sunrise with bulging bellies and\
  \ crimson blood stained faces.  Interesting animals sporting oversized rounded ears,\
  \ with mottled coloring of black, brown, yellow and white with a black mask appearing\
  \ to cover their eyes, noses and mouths; each dog\u2019s unique blend of color serves\
  \ as identification for the pack.  A group of pups innocently play while being stalked\
  \ above by several eagles.   \u201CStop playing, go back into your den, you\u2019\
  re not safe!\u201D I silently urge the pups.  A protective adult spots the eagles\
  \ and the pups are herded into the den, into safety.\n\nMore bubbles escape into\
  \ fizzy bursts while my thoughts travel to the evening safari, mere hours after\
  \ watching the wild dogs.  It is twilight and the sky becomes a canvas of golden\
  \ rich hues layered with rosy peach fading into violet, and the leafless trees transform\
  \ into sinister silhouettes.  There is a chill in the air and the evening calm turns\
  \ to panic as a herd of impalas chaotically sprint in all directions.  Wild dogs\
  \ are a cohesive hunting team and methodically separate the slower and weaker of\
  \ the herd.  The coppery-tan impalas with white bellies and large dark eyes framed\
  \ by long, enviable eyelashes have a gentle nature and move with grace and speed.\
  \  Always one to cheer for the vulnerable and down trodden, I find myself emotionally\
  \ conflicted.  \u201CRUN, RUN\u201D, I whisper to the impala, wishing her to escape\
  \ a fate of bone crushing teeth ripping through flesh.  Images of the wild dogs\
  \ and pups flash through my mind and I am reminded of the significance of each pup\u2019\
  s survival.  Covering my eyes, I surrender to a wisdom far superior than my own.\
  \  The circle of life plays out daily in the wild terrain of South Africa.\n\nStartlingly,\
  \ I am torn away from my thoughts as our guide urgently commands, \u201CCome quick,\
  \ you have to see this\u201D.  The moon\u2019s glow provides just enough light to\
  \ make out the scene.  Two lions are stalking their prey, large African buffalo\
  \ drinking at the watering hole.  African buffalo are very large, but no match for\
  \ two lions.  As the lions sprint toward them for a deadly ambush, the air becomes\
  \ electric and bone chilling.  My heart explodes into my throat; nature, the circle\
  \ of life, and the violence is overwhelming.  Suddenly, snapping branches are cracking\
  \ loudly and the earth is rumbling with stomping hooves and a loud, fierce trumpeting\
  \ cry pierces the air.  The lions are racing away from the watering hole into the\
  \ dark night with a peaceful warrior, the elephant, charging behind.  Nature is\
  \ full of surprises with unexpected twists and turns and unsung heroes providing\
  \ a benevolent balance."
