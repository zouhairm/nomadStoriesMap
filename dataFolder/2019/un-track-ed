Text: "\u201CWhat else is there!\u201D father anxiously exclaimed, visibly agitated.\
  \ I just got up and silently left.\n \nIt was graduation day. Except, I wasn\u2019\
  t going. Concerned, he asked why and my restlessness burst forth, \u201CYou just\
  \ earn a degree; fetch a job; get married, reproduce and die one day?\u201D His\
  \ response was agonizing. Until I replaced his exclamation with my question mark,\
  \ \u201CWhat else is there?\u201D Something I\u2019d secretly wonder as a growing\
  \ kid. Only now, I had the autonomy to find out.\n.\nSo I booked the cheapest interstate\
  \ train ticket from my hometown, Mumbai, to 'God\u2019s own Country', Kerala. A\
  \ quest like this could definitely use a divine head start, I sensed. Hell, a 6$\
  \ fare to God-land was nonetheless a cracker of a deal for a sinner like me! Little\
  \ did I know what I wished to be the journey of a lifetime would become an initiation\
  \ into a life of journeying.\n\nA frail old lady with glasses thick as her wrinkles,\
  \ casually spreading herself and her elaborate homemade meal across my bunk like\
  \ the occupying British forces of pre 1947 India, confirmed my subconscious apprehensions.\
  \ I\u2019d set out with the resolve of an elephant matriarch but didn\u2019t know\
  \ what to expect (or not). I meekly lay my bag in the tiny little space she agreed\
  \ to \u201Cgenerously\u201D spare looking at my despondent face, before making my\
  \ way to the exit. Not to perfect my Spidey skills off a running train but to familiarise\
  \ with a rather hazardous privilege that came without statutory warning.       \
  \  \n\nWinds 100k/hr blew not just \u201Cin my hair\u201D but gushed against every\
  \ inch of my skin, leaving me light as a feather (as also light-headed). Delicately\
  \ leaning at the edge of that naked doorway, a sense of total abandon discreetly\
  \ crept in \u2013 one that had been anchored within for long but seldom found enough\
  \ wind to set sail from the passive shores of a conservative family. The currents\
  \ of self-inquiry had now grown so strong, however, the ship could no longer be\
  \ harboured. The anchor had lifted. \n\nAll of a sudden, home was new \u2013 everywhere.\
  \ So I checked if I was scared. Instead, I found my view of the world opening up\
  \ as the horizon within expanded with the one without. Seemingly infinite expanses\
  \ of green expressively spread across far-reaching stretches, so dense that sometimes\
  \ I wondered if we were trespassing a forest. Like a notorious child sneaking away\
  \ from its pre-occupied parents, the train freely made its way through the lushes.\
  \ For what was being missed outside, the bunks indeed seemed a pre-occupation of\
  \ those trying to find and mimic the comfort and safety of home in the journey.\
  \ I, on the other hand, was looking for everything but home.\n \nI never really\
  \ wanted to \u201Cbecome\u201D anything, nor was I ever concerned with growing up.\
  \ I wanted to just be, simply; to seek, find and discover \u2013 hard for my folks\
  \ to accept than to understand. And as night seeped in with its stunning silence,\
  \ whispering secret celebrations of my redemption, the pitch darkness illuminated\
  \ this suppressed angst to breakaway. Past scenes of me aimlessly wandering through\
  \ the city after school hours, wondering what all the manic fuss was about; all\
  \ the times I\u2019d slammed the door behind me to walk out of heated arguments\
  \ neither I nor my father knew to conduct; my finding a sense of freedom in running\
  \ like a thief on dog-infested streets at 4 am, all flooded my mind, overwhelming.\
  \ Suddenly broken by a tear the wind frayed across my cheek.\n \nI no longer knew\
  \ where I was as the train gently exited the dark tunnel of the night sky to be\
  \ greeted by a scarcely dawning sun. My feet had barely moved for these past 24\
  \ hours \u2013 except to use the loo. As the tracks drew to a standstill, I stood\
  \ enchanted. The destination had arrived. I had not. And never would. For me, I\u2019\
  d become the journey, discovering what travel meant to me: A state of moving in\
  \ search of stillness. I\u2019d leaped into an abyss."
