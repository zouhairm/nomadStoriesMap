Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find that of all my memories of Paris, my favourite\
  \ one would be running down a cobbled street in the rain!\nI started dreaming about\
  \ Paris when I was ten.  My dad and I liked watching classic movies together.  As\
  \ I watched the performers sing and dance, with Paris as the background, I began\
  \ to feel the magic of that city calling me.\n\nEight years later, to celebrate\
  \ my completion of high school, and the beginning of my adult life, I went on a\
  \ dream trip to Europe.  Our first stop, Paris.   Unfortunately, I was quickly disillusioned\
  \ as we left the airport.  It was a city of shiny, new skyscrapers.  Driving into\
  \ Paris was very much like driving into Toronto.  I had crossed an ocean for this!\
  \  \n\nBut then\u2026  The modern buildings began to fade, and older ones began\
  \ to appear.  A cornucopia of old-world architecture, marking the many ages in the\
  \ life of the city. Then I saw it, off in the distance, between the buildings, Mr.\
  \ Eiffel\u2019s tower, and finally, it struck me.  I was there, I was in the Paris\
  \ of my dreams!  It was only for three days before I was on the train to Niece,\
  \ but the memories are burnt into my mind, like a cattle brand. The fountains, the\
  \ gardens, the walls and walls of paintings in the Louvre.\n\nI remember the way\
  \ the sun filled the room as we walked down the hall of mirrors at Versailles. \
  \ And how high the Ferris wheel in the Tuileries went.  We could see all the way\
  \ to the Sacre Coeur from the top of the wheel, in the far-off Montmartre.  Who\
  \ could forget the guys hooting at the lovers making out on the river bed as we\
  \ cruised down the Seine?\n\nThe view from the top of the Eiffel tower was remarkable.\
  \  Paris went on and on in all directions.  It was both an exquisite and sad moment\
  \ for me.  It was my dream to be there, but it was woeful because I knew I was ending\
  \ my life as a child, and beginning one as an adult.  Which meant leaving my friends\
  \ behind and forging a new life in the daunting adult world all by myself. I cried\
  \ because of all the intense emotions swirling around inside me.  \n\nTo get from\
  \ point A to B, in Paris, we went by a subway train.  It was so surreal coming up\
  \ out of the subway station into the heart of Paris.  There before me was the Great\
  \ Paris Opera House.  Definitely a place of mixed magic and surprises.\n\nIt was\
  \ July, so it was hot.  Walking around in the summer heat one got sticky with sweat.\
  \  I am not complaining, I was in Paris.  There was a subway station a few blocks\
  \ from our hotel.  After a long day of exploring, we went back to fresh up before\
  \ supper.  It was sunny when we went into the subway system, but when we resurfaced\
  \ it was raining.  Biblical deluge almost.  \n\nThe sweet smell of rain, washing\
  \ away the hot, stickiness. We waited in an alcove for the rain to stop, but it\
  \ kept on.  Then someone decided what the heck and ran out into the street.  I thought,\
  \ meh, I was going back to the hotel anyways.  As I darted down the street, the\
  \ cool rain felt divine on my burning skin.  Surrounded by my travel companions,\
  \ most of the people I just met, I felt a strangeness.  I was very connected to\
  \ the immediate world around, relishing just living in that moment.  I had been\
  \ so anxious the past few months, what did the future hold for me?  But that moment,\
  \ I knew even though life had its downs, it also had ups.  There were some extraordinary\
  \ moments waiting for me.  Ones I couldn\u2019t even dream of."
