Text: "And suddenly, I spotted an empty seat in the train, right in the middle of\
  \ the wagon. I was shocked, the wagon was full and yet, nobody wanted to seat there.\
  \ I thought I was very lucky since my back pack was really heavy and I wanted to\
  \ sit for a while. I walked there and sat. Immediately, the lady sitting next to\
  \ me started to try to have a conversation with me. I turned to look at her and\
  \ it was at that moment when I realized why the seat was empty. \n\nBut before I\
  \ continue with my story, I think it is better if I first explain how a 19-year-old\
  \ girl from Guatemala ended up in a train in New York City. Since I was around 14\
  \ years old, I wanted to go to college abroad. So after I graduated high school,\
  \ I started the process to go to school in New York City. I was accepted at Borough\
  \ of Manhattan Community college and in January 2014 I moved to there. I only lived\
  \ in New York for a year, but it changed my life completely. \n\nI had been in the\
  \ city for around 4 months and nothing spectacular had happened to me on my train\
  \ rides. I was always hoping to bump into a cute boy on the train and find love,\
  \ but that never happened. I got lost once or twice, but I got used to move by train\
  \ quite easily. Actually, the public transportation system was one of the things\
  \ I liked best about New York. I know that most New Yorkers always complain about\
  \ the train system because it has delays regularly. But to me it was pretty good;\
  \ especially because it gave me a sense of freedom that I did not have back home.\
  \ I just had to look for the train stop that was nearest to the place I wanted to\
  \ go, hop on a train, and I would be there in no time. \n\nSo going back to my story,\
  \ there I was sitting on a train going to 149th street and grand concourse, next\
  \ to a lady that nobody wanted to be around. As she was talking to me, I began to\
  \ feel a certain smell of cigarettes. And I realized it was her. She also smelled\
  \ of something else, but I could not identify what the smell was. She was quite\
  \ nice though, but she seemed kind of odd. She also looked kind of sad. She started\
  \ asking about my family, where I was from, if I was going to school, all sorts\
  \ of things. Then she told me she was a drug addict that lived in the city, that\
  \ she had gone to rehab and was now sober. Apparently everyone on the train knew\
  \ that and they would refuse to sit next to her because of it. How did they know\
  \ about her, I do not know. It was probably by the way she looked: a mixture of\
  \ sadness and neglect. \n\nWhile I was talking to her, I noticed that everyone was\
  \ staring at me just for having a conversation with her. I also realized how lonely\
  \ the lady was. She never really said that, but I could tell by the way she was\
  \ talking to me. All she wanted was to be heard, to connect with someone; hence\
  \ all the questions and the chat about her addiction. And nobody wanted give her\
  \ the chance to start a conversation; they wouldn\u2019t even sit next to her. \n\
  \nAt the beginning I was kind of scared to be around her, but as the conversation\
  \ went on I started to feel more comfortable. What touched me the most was when\
  \ she said goodbye to me. She told me I was a sweet girl and wished me a good day.\
  \ But she did it with such kindness and gratitude that made me feel quite sad for\
  \ her. It also made me feel like I had done something very important for her. That\
  \ just by paying attention to her for some time, I had somehow made a difference\
  \ in her day; that I had left a mark. She definitely left a mark on me."
