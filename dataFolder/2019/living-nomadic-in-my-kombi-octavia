Text: "I started my travel story 46 days ago, the kombi was prepared for living in\
  \ it with all the things I thought I may need as bed, fridge, a place for washing\
  \ dishes and a little space for having my clothes and photography things. The objective\
  \ of my project was to collect old jeans for recycle them and create new things\
  \ with them. That\u2019s why I went to 27 different places in the south of my country\
  \ so that people whi had jeans to give me they could call me so that I could go\
  \ and get them. Also I only paid 3 camping nights, the other nights I changed audio\
  \ visual work making videos for people business, hostel or camping  for a space\
  \ for spending the night in a safe place because I\u2019m a woman travelling alone.\
  \ Of course that I have an Instagram page where I upload all the images I take in\
  \ the different places that  I visit and many followers ask me things about the\
  \ kombi, restauration, travelling alone, where to stay somewhere or just to tell\
  \ me they like my project and life style. I came back now to my home to finish university,\
  \ i\u2019m studying civil engineering and I want to finish the career before continue\
  \ travelling in my kombi around the world, starting with south america. I want to\
  \ influence people to make recycling habits in their lifes and also motivate them\
  \ to travel and to achieve their goals. That is the mision of Octavia, my volkswagen\
  \ kombi from 1985."
