Text: "In my hands I hold blank paper and a boarding pass. Singapore was humid and\
  \ messy. Now and then I caught the smell of food cooking nearby on the street. I\
  \ buy a pineapple with a red bow at the fruit shop and then I WhatsApp message Drew.\
  \ She\u2019s coming down. Now there\u2019s hardly anybody on the street and then\
  \ I see her. It\u2019s day. After all the usual catch up we taxi out to the zoo.\
  \ A painted zebra car snakes its way along holding excited children. Sunlight yawns\
  \ down across the moneys. We stand and spot them. We walked around the zoo for hours,\
  \ enough that my feet began to hurt. \n\nI wander around taking photos with my Hasselblad\
  \ camera. I glide like a time machine through mall after mall, ducking in and out\
  \ of shops. There\u2019s even a mall with a canal and boats running through it.\
  \ I take a photo. I have come to Singapore to escape my bad breakup and I\u2019\
  m trying more than anything to distract myself from thinking about her. So far so\
  \ good.\n\nThe Singapore air feels like skin. It wraps suffocatingly around you\
  \ and the friend I\u2019m staying with doesn\u2019t turn her air conditioning unit\
  \ on. So, I sleep surrounded by this second skin. In the morning, I venture out\
  \ again, paying seven dollars just for a flat white. It\u2019s only when I get into\
  \ air conditioning that the skin melts away and I feel better \u2013 if only for\
  \ a few minutes. \n\nI catch public transport to stations I know, but always counting\
  \ the stops back to Bencoolen. Clothes dangle out of windows and old men cluster\
  \ on the sidewalk. A light summer drizzle softens the mucky air. Today I go to the\
  \ National Orchid Garden and I see many exotic flowers, one after the other. Something\
  \ seems different here and I realise I haven\u2019t been thinking about my breakup\
  \ since I arrived in Singapore. The colours are like playdoh, they are bright and\
  \ mould into the air and sky. I can\u2019t believe how beautiful some of them are.\
  \ I prefer to look at them, taking my time rather than a photograph. And that\u2019\
  s when I see one that really takes my breath away. I must have it. I can\u2019t\
  \ not. If I don\u2019t I will explode. That\u2019s how I ended up with a bent flower\
  \ in my backpack on the train back. I\u2019m not even sure what the flower\u2019\
  s name was, but it was yellow, and it was mine.\n\nThat night, my friend was busy,\
  \ so I sat at the restaurant 25 Degrees and ate curly fries and a mojito. The rain\
  \ outside sounds like music notes pounding at the pavement. I enjoyed simply sitting\
  \ there with my drink looking closely at the passers-by on the street. The way they\
  \ merged into a colourful blur. I ordered a second drink. I started to make a mental\
  \ to-do list in my head: pack for tomorrow, buy your mum a souvenir, wash pants\
  \ in the sink, get photos developed. Then after some time, no thoughts came to me\
  \ and I was suddenly part of the Singaporean scenery, someone who likes just getting\
  \ on a plane and seeing where life takes them. My soul will not be still until there\
  \ are words on paper. I take out my pen and blank paper, I like blank paper, and\
  \ begin to write."
