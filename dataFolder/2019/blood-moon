Text: "A sharp knock on the door startled us in our beds. The first instinct was fear,\
  \ being two young women in the politically charged and often unstable region of\
  \ Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir in India. I asked who it was, sounding braver than\
  \ I felt.\nTo our relief, we heard the familiar voice of Jahan Mohammad, also known\
  \ as Johnny, the sixty-year-old boatman assigned to our houseboat. \u2018Madam,\
  \ it\u2019s just me. Can you come out? I\u2019d like to show you something.\u2019\
  \nThe same morning, we had woken up at 3 am and climbed into Johnny\u2019s shikara,\
  \ his boat which is lovingly decorated with white and pink silky frills and soft\
  \ cushions, to go to the famous morning vegetable market on Dal Lake.\nAs the sun\
  \ rose lazily, we rowed through fields of water lilies stretching as far as the\
  \ eye could see and sleepy little villages waking up to a busy day. Soon Johnny\
  \ pulled out a flask of hot, homemade kehwa, a delicious dry-fruit infused tea to\
  \ warm us up.\nDal Lake is a buzzing ecosystem, home to many small villages. Shikaras\
  \ are the lifelines of this floating world, used for transport, as shops and for\
  \ ferrying tourists to and from houseboats. The chaotic market is an overwhelming\
  \ experience, with shikaras skillfully dodging each other, hawking fresh produce\
  \ and dewy, colorful flowers.\nWe then spent the day visiting places Johnny recommended,\
  \ from the magical Pari Mahal which literally means \u2018Palace of Fairies\u2019\
  \ to Shankaracharya Temple, with breathtaking panoramas of the valley.\nWe had returned\
  \ happy and tired and ready to call it a night when Johnny knocked.\nHe stood on\
  \ the porch of the houseboat and beyond him, a silent, inky Lake Nigeen, gleamed\
  \ as the light of the almost full moon glanced off faint ripples.\n\u2018Sorry to\
  \ disturb you, madam, I was going home but the lake just looked so beautiful, I\
  \ thought I\u2019d ask you ladies if you fancy a shikara ride? I would love the\
  \ company.\u2019\nWe didn\u2019t need to be asked twice and stepped onto the little\
  \ shikara. Underneath the seats was a stash of Johnny\u2019s guilty pleasures- bottles\
  \ of red wine gifted by delighted foreign tourists and strong, local cigarettes\
  \ that he hid from his family.\nWe settled in and he started rowing leisurely, in\
  \ no particular direction. I asked him how he wasn\u2019t tired from rowing all\
  \ day. He just laughed, \u2018I\u2019ve been rowing on these lakes since I was nine.\
  \ I don\u2019t feel a thing!\u2019\nHe asked if we minded him singing. We assured\
  \ him we would be honoured and his melodious, powerful voice, rough from crude cigarettes,\
  \ rang out loud and clear across the moonlit lake, keeping rhythm with the paddle\u2019\
  s soft splash.  \nHe sang in the local Kashmiri dialect so I sat back and enjoyed\
  \ the beautiful sounds of the words I did not understand.\nAfter the last notes\
  \ faded away, my curiosity got the better of me so I broke the comfortable silence\
  \ we had settled into and asked him what the song was about. He carefully poured\
  \ out and handed us each a little paper cup of red wine.   \n\u2018It\u2019s a folk\
  \ song\u2019, he said, \u2018about a lost Kashmir.\u2019\nHe smiled a wistful smile\
  \ that was different from the toothy grin on the weathered face we had gotten so\
  \ used to.\n\u2018It\u2019s the lament of a mother who lost her son to the violence\
  \ in Kashmir. She sings of how the soul of her beloved land has been taken away\
  \ from her, just like the soul of her son\u2019, he said with a quiet sadness in\
  \ his voice.\n\u2018She talks about a Kashmir of lush valleys and gurgling springs\
  \ which was once a perfect paradise before the hate, bloodshed, and violence destroyed\
  \ it. A bountiful Kashmir where poets and painters found inspiration, where today\
  \ rosy-cheeked children have picked up guns. She grieves because all that\u2019\
  s left of her Kashmir is memories and this song.\u2019\nWe sat in the same boat\
  \ yet worlds apart, sipping our wine, on the lake that swallowed the tears of its\
  \ boatmen and marveled at the beauty of a land that was forgotten, while countries\
  \ fought over it."
