Text: "The Woodworker\u2019s Gift\n\n\"Come with me,\" he says. I follow him towards\
  \ the shed behind the vegetable garden. It\u2019s not far but I\u2019m careful to\
  \ slow my pace so I don\u2019t pass him. A sweet, woody smell overtakes me as I\
  \ step inside. Shelves of Huon pine, eucalyptus and sassafras fill half the room\
  \ while the remainder is lined with machinery and an array of seemingly identical\
  \ tools. \n\n\"This is English Elm,\" he tells me, holding up a pale rectangular\
  \ block. He proceeds to measure and mark each end with a pencil and then eases his\
  \ way to a machine by the entrance. He fits the timber in between two metal bits\
  \ to keep it in place and with a gentle 'click' it begins to spin. \n\nHe takes\
  \ down one of his tools from the wall and places the metal end against the Elm,\
  \ skillfully shaving off the sharp edges, transforming the block into a cylinder.\
  \ Pencil-like shavings hit the ground and every few seconds he stops and takes down\
  \ an alternate chisel to continue manipulating the wood. Although each one looks\
  \ the same to my untrained eye, they all hold a specific purpose to the woodworker.\
  \ \n\nHis typically shaky hands become steady as he works. Once he's satisfied with\
  \ the shape he begins to sand the surface with five separate pieces of sandpaper\u2014\
  each grain finer than the last.  Then he brings out a torn rag and a tin of oil\
  \ to stain the object, wiping it clean so it doesn\u2019t bleed.\n\nFinally, he\
  \ puts his hands behind his back and asks, \"Have you been a good girl?\u201D. I\
  \ nod as enthusiastically as if I were seven years old, not 27, and he places the\
  \ smooth oval item into my palms. I go to hug him but the oil is too slick and the\
  \ gift flies from my fingers, denting as it hits the wood-chip covered floor. I'm\
  \ mortified. This man has been meticulously working on this object and I\u2019ve\
  \ gone and thrown it to the ground. \n\nI pick it up quickly, hoping his eyes aren't\
  \ as sharp as his mind. \u201CGive it here,\u201D he says. I hand it back to him\
  \ and he attempts to sand it smooth, then applies one last layer of oil. \"I don't\
  \ like my work being damaged,\u201D he tells me as he puts the piece back into my\
  \ hands. I grasp the wooden egg firmly and thank him.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m overwhelmed\
  \ by the gift, it is the experience that I\u2019m thanking him for."
