Text: "My husband and I just returned from our first ever journey to Europe. We traveled\
  \ to Lisbon, Portugal for 5 days, and I am still rubbing my eyes like it was a dream!\
  \ I\u2019ve come up with a list of the must-do activities and recommended restaurants\
  \ in Lisbon. After reading this, it is my hope you are further inspired to travel\
  \ to Lisbon, or just inspired to go and explore anywhere!\n\nMust-Dos While in Lisbon:\n\
  1. Eat at Ponto Final. Take the ferry from Lisbon across to Almada to Ponto Final.\
  \ If it\u2019s cold outside, wear extra layers and eat outside on the pier. You\u2019\
  ll enjoy phenomenal views of Lisbon across the Tagus (Tejo) River!\n\n2. Visit the\
  \ Santu\xE1rio Nacional de Cristo Rei. After Ponto Final, you can walk to a lift\
  \ that takes you up to a 2-mile path up to Cristo Rei (Christ the King). The Santu\xE1\
  rio Nacional de Cristo Rei was completed in 1959 after ten years of construction.\
  \ The statue was built by the support/approval of Portuguese bishops at the Portuguese\
  \ Episcopate conference in 1940 as a symbol of peace to both plea & thank God for\
  \ the absence of Portugal in World War II. \n\n3. See a Fado show with dinner. Fado\
  \ is a style of Portuguese music that is both beautiful and haunting. It is associated\
  \ with the word \u201Csaudade\u201D or longing. We found a restaurant (Pastel do\
  \ Fado) with FREE Fado every night beginning at 7pm. The food was fabulous and the\
  \ Fado singer (or Fadista) was even better! \n\n4. Ride Tram 28 and get a scenic\
  \ view of the city. Make sure you get on at Martim Moniz (or Campo Ourique) so you\u2019\
  ll have a better chance of getting a seat! You\u2019ll enjoy a memorable ride through\
  \ Graca, Alfama, Baixa and Estrela screeching and rattling up and down the narrow\
  \ streets.\n\n5. The Santa Justa Lift: A top toutist attraction, but also a transportation\
  \ device that takes you from the lower streets of Baixa, up to a platform connecting\
  \ to Carmo Square. Tip: Get a Viva Viagem card and use it to ride the lift, metro\
  \ (subway), buses, trams, and funiculars. You can pay \u20AC6.15 for 24 hours, or\
  \ choose the re-load option. \n\n6. Go to Time Out Market Lisboa for a meal. Time\
  \ Out Market is like a giant cafeteria with food stalls everywhere. You can find\
  \ everything from sushi to hamburgers, octopus, several different takes on bacalhau,\
  \ piri-piri chicken, gelato, chocolates, and the ubiquitous pastry of Lisbon, the\
  \ Pastel de Nata at Manteigaria.\n\n7. Go to Sintra to see the castles! Take the\
  \ train from Rossio Square to Sintra (runs every 20  minutes). If you are paying\
  \ for one-way tickets, make sure you buy two zones or you won\u2019t be able to\
  \ exit the station.\n\n8. Enjoy Portuguese Wines! If you are in Portugal, you might\
  \ as well drink like a local! There are so many wines to choose from, they are very\
  \ affordable, and nearly everything is good. \n\n9. Eat bacalhau! Bacalhau is the\
  \ Portuguese word for cod, and if you come to Lisbon, bacalhau is EVERYWHERE on\
  \ restaurant menus. The bacalhau in question is salt cod, which has been preserved\
  \ by drying/curing with salt. My favorite way to enjoy bacalhau is in a pastel de\
  \ bacalhau from Casa Portuguesa do Pastel de Bacalhau! It\u2019s basically a cod\
  \ fish fritter filled with Serra da Estrela cheese. \n\n10. Stop for a shot of ginjinha!\
  \ GInjinha is a Portuguese liqueur made by infusing ginja berries (sour cherry)\
  \ in Aguardiente (an alcoholic beverage that contains between 29% and 60% alcohol\
  \ by volume). There are several places to try ginjinha. The liqueur is sweet and\
  \ powerful, and sipping it slowly while we talked about our trip was a perfect way\
  \ to cherish our last moments in Lisbon.\n\nThank you Lisbon, for being so lovely\
  \ and delicious in every way possible. And now I know what it is like to experience\
  \ saudade\u2026but this time to long for a place. I miss Portugal already, but each\
  \ day that goes by brings my closer to our next visit, and next time we will visit\
  \ Porto for more adventures!"
