Text: "it was 2 years ago when i was chosen for a summer long trip to Turkey. To be\
  \ honest at first i had lots of stress to being alone in somewhere that I heard\
  \ about some terroristic acts over there in medias. And in other hand it is so close\
  \ to my hometown so I thought there isn\u2019t any new experiences there...but wait!\
  \ Everything changed when I entered! \nFirst thing that changed my mind was culture!\
  \ When me and my host family talked I understood about some cute aspects of their\
  \ culture! For example if they wanna say to their host that they don\u2019t want\
  \ tea anymore, they put their spoon on top of their glass horizontally! \nSecond\
  \ thing was its friendly people! For the first time in my life I experienced hitchhik!\
  \ It was surprising that how people like to talk with foreigners and help them to\
  \ truly discover their country! I think its not necessary to mention that it was\
  \ safe too!!\nOkay but lets don\u2019t forget that most of people choose turkey\
  \ because of beaches! What kind of beach that you like, you can find there!! I bet\
  \ even if you go there for another reason i can find you in one of its beach!\n\
  Annnnnd here it is! Foodies! I don\u2019t wanna spoil anything...you should try\
  \ it yourself specially if you like sweet taste.\nI come from a historic country\
  \ so I didn\u2019t think something could touch my heart there but kalechi (in Antalya)\
  \ is something that gives you an opportunity to live in history with modern stuff\
  \ so its the only thing that i want to mention by its name.\nIn the end! You can\
  \ find their foods in your country! You can find perfect photos in internet! But\
  \ you CANNOT find culture, people, nightlife, atmosphere and things like them without\
  \ visiting there! Go there and discover your own story!!"
