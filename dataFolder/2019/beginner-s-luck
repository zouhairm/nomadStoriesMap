Text: "We woke up before 7am, packed our stuff, had breakfast and we went to the road\
  \ to try hitchhiking for the first time. We were in a small village called Corti\xE7\
  \xF4 da Serra in Portugal close to the Spanish border.\n\nWe wrote our desired destination\
  \ \u201CSalamanca\u201D in a piece of cardboard and we started to wave our thumbs.\
  \ It was an early  summer morning and I remembered that was really hot. \n\nEven\
  \ though I like to try new experiences, to be honest I was not that hopeful since\
  \ there weren\xB4t many cars. But suddenly a Portuguese lady stopped! She offered\
  \ to drive us around 15km ahead where she works and of course we accepted. The only\
  \ downside was that she was late so she left us in an inappropriate place where\
  \ we weren\xB4t allowed to hitchhiking. We had to walk around 3km carrying heavy\
  \ backpacks under the firing sun to find a good spot and try it again. \n\nAt that\
  \ moment we were a bit hopeless because the cars were close to the highway so they\
  \ were driving very fast and there was nothing close to buy, not even water.\n\n\
  Some drivers were nice and signalized that they had space but unfortunately only\
  \ for one person. \n\nAt 9h59 a Spanish angel just dropped on the road to help us.\
  \ A really really nice guy who lives in Bilbao and he was going back home after\
  \ a business trip in Portugal. And Salamanca was on his way for our luck!!! I can\u2019\
  t describe my happiness in that moment. Do you know the feeling when someone is\
  \ helping you without expecting anything?! A genuine favor that you just can\u2019\
  t believe it still exists nowadays. It was simply amazing!\n\nVery kind person,\
  \ we talked all journey long. Time went so fast!\n\nBefore lunch we were in Salamanca\
  \ with the feeling that we aren\xB4t alone in this world and it doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ if you are in a unknown place because someone will always show up to help you.\
  \ \n\nThis adventure left us unforgettable memories and helped us to save some money.\
  \ \n\nEternal gratitude!"
