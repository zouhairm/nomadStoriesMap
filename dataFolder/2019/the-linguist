Text: 'Welcome to "NICE".


  On arriving in France with two years of secondary school level study''s of French
  Oral and with very little written word.


  I knew I was in way over my head, previous experience of living and working in an
  environment where the language was not my strong point.

  Bonjour to anybody that would listen

  Ju ma pel Phillipe, Jai Habit Dublin...

  That''s all I could throw out of my mouth confidence is a strong point memory too.


  After a few days of trying my hardest not to sound like del boy from only fools
  and horse''s with my broken spoken word with poor French dialect, I had noticed
  that my ear was picking up on a language that I must have known in a past life,
  remarkably my internal intuitive Psyche was signaling that these customers are talking
  about me or maybe I''m paranoid.


  Body Language doesn''t lie the body cannot lie, not that there was malice within
  the conversations all be it my lack of conversation i sensed something is abrupt.


  Ignorance is a lesser word I would like to use, I struggled with my French to spark
  off a mediocre international Frenzy as the two customers looked at myself amused
  from the warm felt glow of there eyes as they bought starred through my soul knowing
  I was out of my dept.


  "Pardon our bemused look at you my friend, where are you from?"


  "Dublin" I replied.


  Ah I see, we where trying to figure out where the accent was from, obviously not
  a local, do excuse my English it is very weak.


  "Your English is better than my French" I said.


  An my English is Irish Narrative with an awkward syntax.


  They bought look at each other confused.


  Let''s stick to French.'
