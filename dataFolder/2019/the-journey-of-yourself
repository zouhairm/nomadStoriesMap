Text: "As I walked along this street for the first time, this place seemed extremely\
  \ familiar to me. I could see a grandmother, walking down this narrow street at\
  \ her own pace, fit into this one picture. Children's voices in the background,\
  \ the smell of freshly baked bread. Sunday in a village somewhere in Greece. \n\
  [We carry memories with us]\n\n  And this made me think that for all the places\
  \ we have traveled, all the places we have lived and from all the things we have\
  \ seen, there is something we could never leave out: people. The people we were\
  \ with, the people we met or the ones, the unknown ones, who synthesized beautifully\
  \ the scene of one of our moments. \n[We carry people with us]\n\n  So places come\
  \ with people and people come with places. And in this context, we carry with us\
  \ the place we grew up, the place we gave our first kiss, the place we raised our\
  \ voices together, where we felt that the world has shrunk and we are a part of\
  \ it. Places which fostered our sense of belonging, our sense of purpose, we had\
  \ this moment of self-reflection and introspection. We are the sum total of our\
  \ experiences. And those \u201Cplaces\u201D were generated by our interactions,\
  \ direct or indirect, with others. \n[We carry feelings with us] \n\n  They say\
  \ that everyone that has been in your life has been there for a reason. But as people\
  \ come and go in your life, they come with good intentions or they do not, let me\
  \ remind you (us) something more important: \u201CTake care of your body. Your mind\
  \ and your heart. It\u2019s the only place you have to live.\u201D \n\n  Carry your\
  \ soul along your journey."
