Text: Travelling and knowing the unknown has always been a great source of pleasure
  and enjoyment for me. A few days ago, i went to visit a historic place named " Balihar
  Rajbari ". It was a Palace of a lost Kingdom. It was built in 1296 !  That was a
  very adventurous trip for me. Because the Palace was restricted place to enter for
  public. The condition of the palace was very vulnerable.  It could fall down at
  any time . But we entered into the main building from the back side secretly. And
  what i saw there was totally surprising and shocking ! There was breaking walls
  and pillars everywhere , dead cats and dogs , declining monuments. It was just 2
  pm but the rooms was so dark that it seemed like midnight in the rooms . Then we
  reached to the centre fountain in tge hall room . Suddenly it came my mind that
  time is very cruel and brutal ! Just imagine how colourful and joyful the palace
  was 500 years ago ! How passionate the king was ro build this building  ! How was
  the days  ! How was the people  ! Was the queen so beautiful  ! How many people
  were hanged to death here ! Was the princess so beautiful ! how many war took place
  there !! Who knows  !!!  !! And today only bat flies here  ! Where is the king !
  Where is his empire  !! I think the palace will fall down after some years ! But
  the stories behind it  !? The characters behind it  !? the sacrifices behind it
  !?  And the queens !! R.I.P beautiful stories ! Obviously  It was a risky journey
  for me.  But it took me hundreds years back to the wave of history . So, it's welcome
  back to reality from 500 years back !
