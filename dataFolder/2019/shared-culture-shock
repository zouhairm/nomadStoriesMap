Text: "At 22 years old, I\u2019d never flown on an airplane before. I\u2019d never\
  \ left my country, never held a job, and never lived entirely on my own. All of\
  \ this changed as I embarked on a 14-hour flight to Tokyo to start my new life as\
  \ an assistant language teacher. I had studied the Japanese culture and language\
  \ voraciously, intrigued by my grandfather\u2019s tales of life as an army medic\
  \ in postwar Fukuoka, Japan. As a teenager drafted to war in 1945, he was thrust\
  \ into a country struggling to rise from the ashes of the bombings of Hiroshima\
  \ and Nagasaki. Inspired by the perseverance of the locals despite the rampant famine,\
  \ he forged bonds by sharing his rations and attempting communication with the few\
  \ words he was able to pick up. Though he had never intended to go there, he fell\
  \ in love with Japan and the Japanese, and resolved to return one day.\nI arrived\
  \ late in the day, jet-lagged and stiff, but the energy of the city was almost tangible,\
  \ a persistent hum resonating from the flashing neon advertisements to the greetings\
  \ of \u2018Irrashaimase\u2019 shouted by the shop workers. My colleagues, most of\
  \ whom had lived in Japan previously, guided me through the frantic streets, where\
  \ students and businessmen alike dashed nonchalantly towards some crucial appointment,\
  \ accustomed to the crippling chaos that nearly paralyzed me. We passed through\
  \ meandering alleys, ducking into shops indiscriminately to peruse whatever assortment\
  \ of goods might be hidden within. There were large chain stores selling discounted\
  \ electronics next to smaller family-owned shops dedicated to a particular craft\
  \ whose secrets had been passed down for generations. The smell of smoke and unidentifiable\
  \ fried foods drifted out of the restaurants we passed, mingling with the salty\
  \ scent of the nearby ocean, and as my coworkers rejoiced to be back in this exotic\
  \ world, I felt completely alone. The Japan that my grandfather had described was\
  \ nowhere to be found. \nI had studied the rapid growth Japan experienced in the\
  \ years following World War 2, seen films set in the country, and read online articles\
  \ detailing contemporary culture. Still, my expectations were rooted in the traditional\
  \ images of women clad in kimono, meals consisting solely of fish and rice, and\
  \ Buddhist monks in prayer at a local temple. The Tokyo I stepped into shattered\
  \ my outdated illusions. I was surrounded by smartly dressed businessmen and skyscrapers,\
  \ gourmet foods from around the globe, and high-tech trains of renowned punctuality.\
  \ Even the toilets were impressive, with more buttons and sounds than the simple\
  \ flush toilet I was used to. Stunned by my own misconceptions, I wanted nothing\
  \ more than to withdraw to my hotel and dwell in the fantastical image of Japan\
  \ I had formulated in my mind. Fortunately, I met up with some Japanese friends\
  \ I met in college who helped me see the old Japan within the new. Dwarfed between\
  \ skyscrapers, there were still tiny shrines. Women still dressed in yukata at local\
  \ festivals. Fish and rice were still present in traditional breakfasts, although\
  \ the unexpected and unidentifiable foods were a delicious surprise. \nBut most\
  \ importantly to me, the perseverance that my grandfather was inspired by, and in\
  \ turn inspired me, was still very much present. I saw it in the refugees who had\
  \ relocated after the tragic tsunami in March 2011 and created a new life for themselves.\
  \ It permeated into the schools, where students would push through rigorous testing\
  \ and cram schools in order to attend a coveted university. And I tried to embrace\
  \ it as well, pushing through my initial shock and discomfort and observing the\
  \ country and people around me with no expectations. I fell in love with a Japan\
  \ that was unknown to me. My grandfather was never able to return and passed away\
  \ days after I arrived, but I will be forever grateful that we were both able to\
  \ share the experience of challenging expectations and taking on the unknown in\
  \ Japan."
