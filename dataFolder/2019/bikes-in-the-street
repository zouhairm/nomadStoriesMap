Text: "The click of my seatbelt was the sound of my entire life changing. As I finished\
  \ placing my items under the seat in front of me, I sat up and took one last look\
  \ at the city I was born and raised in. Detroit was my home for over two decades\
  \ but it was time to say good-bye. My fear of flying was amplified by the anxiety\
  \ of leaving the comfort of my support system and everything I ever knew for a country\
  \ I was only nominally familiar with. \n\nGermany was a country I never gave a thought\
  \ to; besides learning the half truth about the Holocaust in high school and how\
  \ my teacher romanticized the life and death of Ann Frank, Germany wasn\u2019t exactly\
  \ on my radar. That wasn\u2019t until the summer of 2008 when I was invited by a\
  \ friend to come to visit them in Germany. I was intrigued. I had always wanted\
  \ to travel and document my travels photographically. I was and still am obsessed\
  \ with National Geographic and Time Magazine and traveling was something I always\
  \ wanted to do with my life. With that being said, I had never been out of the country\
  \ before and I didn\u2019t exactly count Canada because I could see Canada. Just\
  \ a ten-minute drive from my home to Downtown Detroit and a look across the Detroit\
  \ River and there\u2019s Canada. So, of course, I said yes to the invite and prepared\
  \ to take my first official journey across the Atlantic.\n\nI made it to Nuremberg,\
  \ Germany and I already felt like I didn\u2019t want to go back and I hadn\u2019\
  t even left the airport yet. The drive through the city to the countryside of Bavaria\
  \ where my friend was living was surreal. The air was different. The building structures\
  \ looked as if they were stuck in the past (many of which have indeed gone untouched)\
  \ and people were riding their bikes in the street! Growing up in Detroit, I had\
  \ never seen anyone bike in the street and as uneventful as that sounds, it was\
  \ quite foreign to me. I spent the better part of a week in Germany, didn\u2019\
  t know the language but I found myself picking up words here and there that sounded\
  \ similar to those in the English language. I found myself falling in love with\
  \ a country I never knew could charm me in the way that it did, given what I learned\
  \ about it Stateside. \n\nI had gotten a taste of what life outside of the \u201C\
  Land of the Free\u201D was like and upon my return, I couldn\u2019t help but feel\
  \ imprisoned. I wanted to go back. I needed to go back. I knew I wasn\u2019t living\
  \ to my full potential in Detroit and after everything I saw in Germany, I felt\
  \ as though I was meant for much more than the bounded life I created for myself.\n\
  \nSo, there I was, two years after my first visit to Germany, risking it all; I\
  \ had a thousand dollars in my bag, everything I own that I could carry with me\
  \ and minimal knowledge of the language. I was taking the leap, as one would say.\
  \ As the plane took off, I rested my forehead on the window and watched the city\
  \ I called home become smaller as the plane gained altitude. There was literally\
  \ no turning back and as terrified as I was to embark on this new journey, my excitement\
  \ overthrew those emotions.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years since then and it\
  \ still feels surreal to be here but Germany was already my home in my heart from\
  \ the very first moment I stepped foot on its soil and it will always be my home\
  \ where ever life takes me next."
