Text: "As a city girl, moving to a very rural part of Japan wasn\u2019t my first choice\
  \ but as I pulled out the striped folding fan from my yukata to begin the dance,\
  \ I knew I had made a good decision. I was placed in Tsukumi by the JET Programme,\
  \ a government program to bring native English speakers to help teach English in\
  \ public schools. Tsukumi is a small town on the southern island of Kyushu. Squished\
  \ between the mountains and ocean, this industrial town is not very high on any\
  \ traveller\u2019s list of places to visit, but here I am, now calling it home.\
  \ \n\nLike most small towns around the world, there isn\u2019t a lot happening in\
  \ Tsukumi. However, it didn\u2019t take long for the locals to start telling me\
  \ about the few things that are special about the town. One very special thing is\
  \ the fan dance. \n\nTsukumi\u2019s fan dance was introduced to me by a student.\
  \ My first task as an Assistant Language Teacher was to help students for the yearly\
  \ speech contest. One student had grown up with the dance and dreamed of being one\
  \ of the dancers on the stage (most people dance around the stage in circles). This\
  \ was the topic of her speech. Through her speech, I learned about how this traditional\
  \ folk dance is so important to the people of Tsukumi. \n\nAs the story goes, the\
  \ dance is a memorial for a brave man and a farmer killed in a war. The dance creates\
  \ a unique image with the contrast between the elegant fan movements and the depictions\
  \ of war. Every August the city joins in the park to dance. With a history of approximately\
  \ 450 years, it has become a significant part of the town\u2019s identity. \n\n\
  The following year I was asked by a woman at the board of education if I wanted\
  \ to join the fan dance. I could join the group from city hall. I instantly said\
  \ yes. I grew up dancing so, the idea of the town\u2019s fan dance intrigued me.\
  \ She told me there would be 2 practices in the week leading up to the festival.\
  \ I was excited to be a part of this.\n\nI typically don\u2019t have contact with\
  \ people from city hall so, I was a bit nervous walking into the practice. Since\
  \ my Japanese ability was basic at best, I intently watched and tried to mimic the\
  \ moves. The simple instructions of \u201CMigi\u201D (right) and \u201CHidari\u201D\
  \ (left) helped me to pick it up.  Thankfully, Japanese folk dances tend to be simple\
  \ and repetitive. I was hearing \u201CJouzu\u201D (skillful) directed at me by the\
  \ end of the 20-minute practice. If there is one thing the Japanese are good at,\
  \ it\u2019s liberally giving compliments especially when it comes to learning about\
  \ their culture.\n\nSaturday was the big day. We met at a restaurant before the\
  \ festival to get ready. Each group participating in the dance had its own yukata\
  \ design. Again, I was met with liberal compliments of how I looked in a yukata.\
  \ Once everyone was ready, we walked down to the park. The sun had already set by\
  \ the time we arrived. The park was illuminated by a tower of colourful lanterns\
  \ in the centre. It wasn\u2019t long before everyone was in their places. A spark\
  \ of adrenaline hit me as the drums started and the dancing began. Any nerves I\
  \ had quickly disappeared. I might have misstepped a few times but so did others.\
  \ It was more about participating in the dance than being a perfect dancer.\n\n\
  This was the kind of experience I hoped for when moving to Japan. Being brought\
  \ into such a special event made me feel like I'm really a part of this town. I\
  \ wasn\u2019t standing on the outside watching like a guest. I was able to be an\
  \ active member of the community. I was able to share in an event that these people\
  \ hold close. The smiles reassured me that I was more than welcomed here. I flopped\
  \ down on my bed that night looking forward to joining again next year. This countryside\
  \ life isn\u2019t that bad."
