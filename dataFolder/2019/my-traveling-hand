Text: "There are some souvenirs you get while traveling that you carry with you. During\
  \ my first few weeks in Thailand, some popular souvenirs I\u2019ve seen are strange\
  \ musical instruments played by shaving a wooden frog with a stick and various objects\
  \ with the likeness of an elephant. Because my trip is an extended one and my backpack\
  \ is already oversized, these souvenirs are off limits. That\u2019s fine with me\
  \ because I\u2019m learning that the best souvenirs are the ones that are left on\
  \ your body. \n\nA week ago, I took a minibus from Chiang Mai to Pai and as I looked\
  \ down at my right hand, my unexpected carsickness was temporarily lifted as I admired\
  \ the souvenirs my time in Thailand had left on it: a brass ring with the face of\
  \ a mysterious monk, a stamp from a raucous after hours club called Spicy, and a\
  \ bite mark left over from the jaws of a dog I should\u2019ve known better than\
  \ to touch (I don\u2019t have rabies, don\u2019t worry). As I looked down at these\
  \ souvenirs, each very different and unique, I was reminded by another souvenir\
  \ that was no longer on my hand, water that was poured on my hand by a man in Bangkok.\
  \ \n\nVery few people I have met have actually liked Bangkok. The most common thing\
  \ said about it by travelers  is \u201Ctwo nights is enough\u201D and the second\
  \ most common thing is \u201Cit was loud and crowded.\u201D I spent a full week\
  \ in Bangkok because I used it as a base to adjust to the time difference, to hunt\
  \ for a good phone plan, and of course, to sightsee. It takes a long time to get\
  \ around the city and it involved a lot of walking and boat rides for me. I enjoyed\
  \ the underrated canals and the majestic larger than life temples but most of all,\
  \ I was amazed by the advanced degree of nonverbal communication. Maybe in a city\
  \ like Bangkok, with its high population density and endless traffic, quick nonverbal\
  \ communication between people is a skill that has been honed out of sheer necessity.\
  \ \n\nOn several occasions when I stood, petrified, waiting to cross the street\
  \ as an endless stream of vehicles burst forth in front of me, a kind pedestrian\
  \ and occasionally a kind driver would make eye contact and gesture that it was\
  \ okay to go now. \u201CFollow me,\u201D they\u2019d say with the wave of a hand.\
  \ Or conversely, that it was not okay to cross. Equally important if not more so.\
  \ This blew me away because I\u2019ve lived in cities for all of my adult life,\
  \ and I could never imagine a scenario where a stranger would be able to notice\
  \ another stranger, sum up their current predicament if one existed, and offer help\
  \ within the span of 2 seconds.\n\nOne of my favorite Bangkok incidents highlighting\
  \ this impressive nonverbal communication happened after I held an open sugar packet\
  \ while walking down the street (not a great idea in 90 degree weather). My hand\
  \ was sticky and I pulled over to the bay of a canal and was just about to get some\
  \ water out of my bag, when a man I had just made eye contact with for a split second\
  \ came over to me and started pouring water on my hand quickly, diligently, and\
  \ silently, After, he walked away. Just like that, a stranger had washed my hand\
  \ without a single word exchanged. I felt strangely touched.\n\nNow as I look at\
  \ my hand, my souvenirs are gone. The monk ring was too big so I hung it around\
  \ my neck. Thankfully, the dog bite healed. The club stamp has long washed off.\
  \ All I have left is a single mosquito bite. Although I know the wooden frog instrument\
  \ would last a much longer time than any of these other temporal mementos, especially\
  \ the water, it just wouldn\u2019t make for as good of a story. Traveling is all\
  \ about collecting fleeting moments, letting them dissipate, and collecting more\
  \ fleeting moments. Rinse and repeat."
