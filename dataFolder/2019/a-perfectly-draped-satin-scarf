Text: "What numbs that always burning fear sitting in your carcass that you won\u2019\
  t be enough in life? No lover, no friend, no extravagant bird, no flying hero, no\
  \ big dreamer and no big realist. The woman didn\u2019t get scared by these questions.\
  \ Instead she managed to wear those fears like a perfectly draped satin scarf around\
  \ her shoulders and waist. Breathing against her skin. The answer would be hard\
  \ to find in this city, I thought. Maybe because I can\u2019t imagine people finding\
  \ it in a situation where I would feel oppressed; tangled in a believe system so\
  \ deep that climbing out takes more time and energy that tumbling further down.\
  \ Although they would not describe it as though they were tangled, or as though\
  \ they were tumbling. For them it is like walking into the light that happiness\
  \ reflects on their big squares and beige houses. She talked about her answer as\
  \ if it could not be separated from life. They happened simultaneously; with and\
  \ threw the one came the other, haunting each other like Tom and Jerry for eternity.\
  \ When she started talking, truly everything around me blurred. The ancient buildings\
  \ and rusting restaurants around us transformed into vague distant shapes. Her son\
  \ stood next to her like a faithful dog, meters of stretched out white tiles sleeping\
  \ beneath him, making her words feel like a power raised with uncertainty. The uncertainty\
  \ on my behalf. The fear of the simple life and the boring death of it was inhabiting\
  \ this city like a family inhabited a house, but still the family was throwing their\
  \ heads back and laughing, a city where distraction is the main tourist attraction.\
  \ Everyone distracted by everything, eyeballs wandering off to the sky, escaping\
  \ from the humid grease. There was no real peace, although violence was vanished\
  \ from the bare eye. A quality that kept you from sleeping and had covered me with\
  \ restlessness as if it were a second skin. Fierce certainty flowed threw the words,\
  \ like a river floating with the wind, in which the woman answered my question;\
  \ \u201CSo, why do you believe in God?\u201D God had given her the courage to not\
  \ let the fear of being nothing choke her. He made her fear decline, fall and flow\
  \ away. I envied her for finding an existence in a city that could never feel like\
  \ home to me. Her empty void was filled with a presence that was untouchable for\
  \ me. Untouchable for so many, but for most in this particular city the closest\
  \ thing they could touch. Each in their own way. In this city called Jerusalem."
