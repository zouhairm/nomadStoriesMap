Text: "\u201CI don\u2019t know what to do ahead in my career! This travel blogging\
  \ stuff is not working out anymore. I am afraid of the dark future that lies ahead\u201D\
  , I said to my friend, Ravi, while sitting in the auto.\n\n\u201CSir, can I say\
  \ something to you, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201D, came the feeble voice of auto-driver\
  \ who was waiting for the traffic signal to turn green.\n\n\u201CYeah\u2026.\u201D\
  , there was a bit surprise in my tone and wonder in Ravi\u2019s eyes that how an\
  \ auto driver can advise to us.\n\n\u201CSir, as you can see, Ahmedabad is growing\
  \ at a rapid pace and the city is turning no stone unturned to make itself equivalent\
  \ to Metro cities fake development criteria. Around two years ago, when online cab\
  \ booking apps arrived at the scene, we got scared and many of my counterparts left\
  \ this business thinking that the chances of their survival are less. I also thought\
  \ the same\u2026\u2026\n\n\u201CYeah, rightly said\u201D, my voice turning more\
  \ inquisitive.\n\n\u201CBut one of our wiser men denied this threat and said that\
  \ in India, the internet is at the na\xEFve stage, so booking of cab online is a\
  \ far-fetched job\u201D.\n\n\u201CThat too is correct\u201D, Ravi consented.\n\n\
  \u201CWe decided not to leave and that proved correct. Rather the online booking\
  \ cab aggregators took us on the platform and now we earn more through them.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CWow\u201D, that\u2019s quite amazing to hear.\n\n\u201CNow people say\
  \ that we won\u2019t be able to survive anymore as metro is coming here and people\
  \ would prefer metro over auto\u201D, he chuckled and self-started his auto.\n\n\
  \u201CNow that sounds threatening\u201D, fear and tremble in my voice.\n\n\u201C\
  Sir, you also got trapped. Try to understand that Metro is required at those places\
  \ where there are more people and fewer modes of transport. Here, the majority of\
  \ them possess personal vehicles and rest, they use autos. For the metro, one needs\
  \ to go through the long process of checking and standing in the queue. Metro would\
  \ be used for sightseeing rather than commutation\u201D, he said with confidence.\n\
  \n\u201CYour point holds good, but what if turns other way?\u201D\n\n\u201CSir,\
  \ life is all about uncertainties. We, auto drivers feel the most of that. Our whole\
  \ day is dependent on you. Rather we do not have a fixed source of income like you\
  \ have. We need to pursue a hundred plus customers to get one. We need to bargain\
  \ and bribe the policeman to rush through the road. We do not think much about the\
  \ future. We live in the present and try our best to give you the best. Rest is\
  \ all dependant on him.\u201D\n\n\u201CWe live in the present\u201D echoed in my\
  \ mind and heart continuously and I thought for a while, that if this auto driver\
  \ can live on uncertainty every day, why can\u2019t I try my travel blogging again\
  \ with new horizon?\n\nI do have an advantage over him. I have a fixed source of\
  \ income and do not have to convince customers to earn bread and butter. Why not\
  \ try blogging from a new perspective? What I need is a little patience and a new\
  \ outlook.\n\nAnd I started working on my next article immediately\u2026.\n\nAnd\
  \ the auto driver tuned on the radio to make our mood jolly."
