Text: "There\u2019s no greater erasure than the mountains. Uphill is the way to travel.\
  \ When you\u2019re pushing up an incline you don\u2019t look back; you save the\
  \ past until you\u2019re at the peak. Only then you look back and witness the past\
  \ fading into the blue.\n\nWe needed something different after Fez and we found\
  \ it at the end of a four hour bus ride, nestled in the Rif Mountains. Chefchaouen\
  \ comes into view around a mountain bend, an imperfect dream: a mess of blue, white\
  \ and faded red brick veneer make up this Spanish Moroccan town. An imperfect dream,\
  \ I say, but a dream nonetheless.\n\nThe bus pauses at the station without an announcement\
  \ from the driver, a Moroccan Elvis who has spent the last four hours defying logic\
  \ and physics, overtaking slow-moving trucks overloaded with hay on narrow roads\
  \ barely wide enough for two sedans. All the locals stay on the bus while the handful\
  \ of tourists alight.\n\nA taxi driver pulls right up beside us on the sidewalk:\
  \ \u2018Where you want to go?\u2019 15dh gets us up the hill to the gateway of the\
  \ old medina. \nA guy asks us where we\u2019re going and we ignore him. \u2018Where\
  \ you from? Inglis? I help you, friend,\u2019 he says. \u2018What hotel you stay?\u2019\
  \n\u2018We\u2019re not staying in a hotel.'\n\u2018You smoke? Want hashish?\u2019\
  \n\u2018Nah, I don\u2019t smoke.\u2019\n\u2018Okay, maybe later,\u2019 he says,\
  \ turning to dust as we pass through the Bab el-Ain. Even the ground is powder blue\
  \ in the old medina. We climb with our packs past little stores selling knickknacks\
  \ and lazy gentlemen selling figs, plums and grapes on the path.\n\n\u2018This isn\u2019\
  t Morocco,\u2019 our host, David, says with a thick Scottish accent. 'It's a haven'.\
  \ \n\nHe's a sixty-year-old Scotch expat, sprightly but aged from the scrutiny of\
  \ the African sun. He's lived as a naval architect, travelling the world by sea,\
  \ misanthropic yet vivacious. He rolls his third joint in half an hour as the call\
  \ to prayer sounds. More like an opera than a prayer, it echoes through the blue\
  \ streets, bounces off the mountains and reverberates to create an all-encompassing\
  \ symphony, \xE0 la the omnipresence of God. \u2018There are 19 mosques here all\
  \ up,\u2019 David adds. \u2018Really quite a spectacle to hear them all going at\
  \ once; sometimes the harmonies are wondrous, other times\u2026\u2019\n\nAs the\
  \ cry of \"God is Great\" dissipates a new sound rises. A procession of men races\
  \ through a narrow street, singing sad songs with a frenetic pace. Suddenly a coffin\
  \ appears; resplendent, decadent; a vessel Marie Antoinette wouldn\u2019t shrug\
  \ off if she had a head left on her shoulders. \u2018Must be a young guy,\u2019\
  \ David chimes in. \u2018See how all the guys carrying it are young. They\u2019\
  re the best friends of the dead guy. It\u2019s normally a bunch of old men.\u2019\
  \ This inspires another story: \u2018About a month ago this kid from around here,\
  \ 22 years old, collapsed and the doctors pronounced him, death certificate and\
  \ all, and they were marching him back here through the streets and suddenly\u2026\
  \u2019 He stops, leaning forward, before knocking on the coffee table. \u2018He\
  \ wasn\u2019t dead. Turns out he had been smoking too much; his heart slowed to\
  \ the point doctors thought him dead\u2026His mum was screaming; she said don\u2019\
  t open the casket, there\u2019s a djinn (a spirit) inside. Sure enough, it wasn\u2019\
  t a djinn, just a lucky kid\u2026\u2019\n\nWe drink zazas (sweet avocado drinks\
  \ with fruit and flan) opposite the Parador Hotel and eat tagine and vegetable sandwiches\
  \ at Sofia\u2019s Restaurant.\n\nNights, we come up to the terrace, watching the\
  \ sun embossing the mountains in the west. They get blacker and blacker as their\
  \ gold outlines fade and the final call to prayer of the day sounds. A choir of\
  \ muezzins compact with the heavens, their voices filling the cooling air. It\u2019\
  s at this time, the mosques lighting up, the city settling into another timeless\
  \ jovial evening, I think of the Berber and those expelled during the Spanish Inquisition\
  \ who settled in these fertile ranges; I think of paradise and how having travelled\
  \ for epochs, these people finally found an idyllic place to rest. A blissful, peaceful\
  \ sort of place to call home."
