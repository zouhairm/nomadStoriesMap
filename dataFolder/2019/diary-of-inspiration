Text: "A boy born in a middle class family with none exceptional talents. From childhood\
  \ he loves to play cricket very much. Started schooling in govt. School. While he\
  \ was studying in primary classes he had wish to become a cricket like Sachin and\
  \ Dada. Make him out was too difficult for his classmates while he was batting.\
  \ \nTime changes and he was promoted to secondary section of school . Apart from\
  \ his keen interest in sports and games,  he has a soft corner for music. His mother\
  \ wish to teach him guitar but he denied.  He get fascinated by synthesizers and\
  \ his father admitted him to music classes. Still he has that keen interest in sports.\
  \ On day, he saw his seniors are practising for football match. After gathering\
  \ informations , he realises that they are representing the school at regional level\
  \ sports and games. So, his interest of cricket now changed to football.\nHe start\
  \ playing football to get selected in that team. After his struggle of 2 years atlast\
  \ he got selected Team as defender but he wasn't happy as he wants to lead the team\
  \ and for that he needs to practise more and more.  After playing for years in the\
  \ team , he got promoted to lead the team as the captain of the team and won many\
  \ matches after that. Due this,  he was expecting to become a famous footballer\
  \ now. But he wasn't familiar with his destiny created by God. \n\nAfter completing\
  \ his schooling, he joined university for higher studies. Now he came to a huge\
  \ arena of talents. On his 1st year of study he used to play with his mates but\
  \ find it difficult than before still he tries to improve. But his dedication starts\
  \ lacking as he didn't find any opportunity for more in that. As he has also learnt\
  \ playing synthesizer so, he used to play it in his hostel quite often and has created\
  \ a group to jam with them. One day , a boy knocked his hostel room's door while\
  \ he along his mates were jamming and asked him whether he could join. They became\
  \ friends after then and that boy became there band's drummer.  The first show they\
  \ did was a competition held in the annual fest of the university but disqualified.\
  \  The boy was sad and took that as a challenge to improve.  Started practising\
  \ harder and harder so as to make him out of that box from rest of the university\
  \ students.  Next year,  in the 2nd edition of that fest he won every competition\
  \ cultural segments.  He was very much happy then but didn't expect that something\
  \ more is coming to his bag. \nOn 2016, he was got an opportunity to be a part of\
  \ the team which will be going in Cultural exchange program to South Korea.\nHe\
  \ performed in various stages there and got appreciated from many ambassadors ,\
  \ generals and others audiences also.\nThat's what life says .... you didn't expect\
  \ to find anything until and unless God allows."
