Text: "The minute I stepped off the boat, the town of Rovinj took my breath away (that\
  \ should have been a bad thing since I was on a choir tour and I, very much, need\
  \ to breathe in order to sing). It was a dream to simply exist, to live, to breathe,\
  \ in Croatia, even for a few moments.  Cats purred around my feet, sweetly begging\
  \ for attention; the Venetian campanile stood majestically in the distance with\
  \ heaven\u2019s rays shining upon it while gray clouds started to part in the sky.\
  \  Right away, one can easily see the Venetian influence in Rovinj with the symbols\
  \ of the Lion of St. Mark appearing just about everywhere the eye can see.  The\
  \ architecture was exquisite and intricate, yet simple at the same time.  It was\
  \ a cloudy day, so the pastel colors of the surrounding buildings seemed to burst\
  \ with life, so much so that it seemed a little unreal to be in such a beautiful\
  \ place.  The Lion of St. Mark watched over as our group passed under the famous\
  \ Balbi Arch, named after the famous and wealthy Balbi family of Venice.  The arch\
  \ serves as an entrance to the medieval center of Rovinj and a separation from the\
  \ harbor and the main square.  Like in many main squares, there are plenty of opportunities\
  \ for shopping and eating to your heart\u2019s desire.  Maybe you\u2019ll come across\
  \ the same dreamy Croatian gelato man with black-as-night hair and piercing blue\
  \ eyes.  If you\u2019re nice enough, he might go a little overboard with decorations\
  \ and hand you a surprising delightful gelato cone that is sure to provide a memory\
  \ of a lifetime and turn any frown upside down.  On the other side of town is the\
  \ Church of St. Euphemia.  On the outside, it looks like any other random church,\
  \ but once you step inside, it is like you are transported to a whole other world.\
  \  The lights shine angelically on the marble statues of St. Marc, St. George, and\
  \ St. Rocco on the center altar.  The Venetian campanile stands majestically by\
  \ St. Ephemia\u2019s side, with with heaven\u2019s rays shining down upon it."
