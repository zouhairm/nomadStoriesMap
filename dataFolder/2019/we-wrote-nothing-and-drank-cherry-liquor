Text: "I had left my umbrella on the train, and it was beginning to pour. Stacey and\
  \ I made eye contact and, without saying a word, began to sprint in what we hoped\
  \ was the direction of our Airbnb.\nWe couldn\u2019t have been that far off because\
  \ there was only one cluster of houses ahead of us. I ran past a wooden sign that\
  \ said \u201CMera Bajo,\u201D so I knew we were in the right place. Finally I found\
  \ an awning we could both duck under and pulled Stacey\u2019s jacket in that direction.\
  \ \nStacey and I had planned to spend a weekend in a rural village outside of Ortigueira,\
  \ a city in northern Galicia. We wanted to write, and we wanted to relax. Our Airbnb\
  \ had been booked and confirmed. We had purchased train tickets and had double checked\
  \ the schedules. Aside from nearly missing our stop at Mera Bajo and my accidental\
  \ umbrella loss, we were ready.\nI searched for service on my phone so I could send\
  \ a message to our Airbnb host, Jessica. We couldn\u2019t find the house, but Mera\
  \ Bajo wasn\u2019t that big, so I was confident Jessica could come find us. \nWhen\
  \ I finally found service, my call went though. \u201CBut when do you need the house\
  \ for?\u201D Jessica asked me. I looked at Stacey. \u201CThe reservation was for\
  \ this weekend,\u201D I replied. \nJessica was in Costa Rica, and the house was\
  \ not ready. There was no one who could let us in. She was lovely, and this wasn\u2019\
  t her fault, but I realized there was little Jessica could do from Costa Rica to\
  \ help us. We agreed to talk later that day and arrange a refund through Airbnb.\
  \ \nIt was still pouring. I didn\u2019t want to say it, but we both knew we\u2019\
  d taken the last train that day. Stacey\u2019s phone was broken, and mine was dying.\
  \ \nJust then, a woman in a yellow traffic vest emerged from the house behind us.\
  \ She was walking towards us. I looked at Stacey. When she approached us, I explained\
  \ our situation. She shook her head at us for being so unprepared, so irresponsible,\
  \ and so ignorant. We listened, nodded, and did not argue.\nMari\xF1a may not have\
  \ been our biggest fan, but she brought us to someone she thought could help. That\
  \ \u201Csomeone\u201D was actually a couple, Pedro and Maruxa. Stacey and I hobbled\
  \ into their home, soaking wet and shivering, and ten pairs of eyes blinked back\
  \ at us. There was a cake in the middle of the table that no one was eating. Maruxa\
  \ was making coffee, and another woman was picking up plates from the table. She\
  \ paused, and Mari\xF1a apologized profusely for interrupting the party.\nIt was\
  \ Pedro and Maruxa\u2019s 50th wedding anniversary and before I could say \u201C\
  felicidades\u201D my jacket was removed and my brain was switching from Spanish\
  \ to Galician and someone was shoving half of the whole cake onto my plate and Stacey\
  \ was explaining our story and would I like sugar with my coffee? \nAn hour later,\
  \ we had found a home. It wasn\u2019t Pedro and Maruxa\u2019s, but a friend of theirs\
  \ owned a cabin we could stay in. We could pay them the next day. \nPedro\u2019\
  s godson walked us to the cabin, and Pedro showed up at the door a few minutes later\
  \ with bread, eggs, and milk. There were no markets or restaurants in Mera Bajo,\
  \ which we did not account for. I heard Mari\xF1a\u2019s voice in my head, and I\
  \ agreed. \nPedro offered to drive us to the nearest market at 10am the next day.\
  \ We did that, and then Maruxa invited us in for a coffee. A coffee turned into\
  \ a coffee with liquor which turned into trying their homemade cherry liquor which\
  \ turned into trying their wine and tortilla espa\xF1ola and leftover cake and cheese\
  \ and more cherry liquor. Finally Pedro had to leave, because he had a funeral to\
  \ attend. He was 87, he reminded us with a wink. Stacey and I stumbled outside and\
  \ waved to Pedro and Maruxa as we headed back to our cabin. It had finally stopped\
  \ raining, and I wanted to explore."
