Text: "Once I got to see the most wonderful girl in the globe. Her hazel eyes were\
  \ enormous, but the way they looked showed a glaze of disenchantment. Her face was\
  \ dirty and her expression disclosed some kind of reluctant acceptance to the situation\
  \ she lived in; she knew from a very young age what to expect from the world and\
  \ from the people. She was a grownup in the body of a four-year-old. \nAt that time,\
  \ I was volunteering in a Roma people community. In that town, volunteers became\
  \ the ambassadors of hope and curiosity, both at the same time. We were received\
  \ not with a welcoming animus, but with a peculiar attitude from the locals: they\
  \ were impressed. They could not believe we travelled a thousand miles just to play\
  \ with a bunch of children whom they had rejected their whole lives. The mere act\
  \ of arriving to the town was revolutionary. \nVolunteers \u201Crenovated\u201D\
  \ a playground that was never used. It was located between the Roma community, but\
  \ the entrance was restricted to ones who could afford an entrance: impossible for\
  \ the Roma kids. Therefore, instead of going to this park we played with the infants\
  \ in a private soccer field that was borrowed for our activities. \nFirstly, the\
  \ kids proceeded cautiously. Since we did not have a common language, we could not\
  \ talk with each other. Despite that, kids wanted to participate in our games. Day\
  \ by day, we gained their trust. Suddenly children appeared in the soccer fields\
  \ with candy and juice to share with us, they even showed us pictures of their families\
  \ and told us stories about their schools. Even though we could not understand their\
  \ words, they were desperate to share. \nOn the last week we spend volunteering\
  \ our team leader convinced the authorities to let us bring the kids to the playground.\
  \ I could not describe the amount of happiness I saw when the kids stepped into\
  \ the park. All I can remember are laughs, shouts of joy and the hazel eyes of my\
  \ favorite girl wide open and full of joy and gratefulness. \nThese kids had access\
  \ to school and their families were provided with some food during summer. They\
  \ had most of their \u201Cbasic needs\u201D satisfied but they were not developing\
  \ in the same way that other kids did. Roma children lacked something more: inclusion.\
  \ \nIn this little town I got to see love in its purest and rawest way: drawings\
  \ and letters with my name misspelled, the word k\xF6sz\xF6n\xF6m \u2013which means\
  \ \u2018thank you\u2019\u2013 repeated over and over, the subtle crying at the time\
  \ to say goodbye. All this displays of affection showed me how much damage a prejudice\
  \ can make. Will we ever remove the resigned look from the eyes of thousands of\
  \ kids? Maybe if we unnecessarily renovate more parks we could, maybe if we learn\
  \ a few words in a foreign language we could. Recognizing the other as an equal\
  \ is the first step."
