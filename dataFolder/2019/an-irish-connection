Text: "After a difficult year I went to Ireland to connect to a lost love. Or that\u2019\
  s what I thought at least. What I didn\u2019t know was that I would find a powerful\
  \ connection to my ancestors, the land they left a century ago and most importantly\
  \ myself. \nThe trip schedule was jammed packed with the usual tourist destinations\
  \ and activities one would do while in Ireland. But thanks to my sister and travel\
  \ companion, it would also include stops in various small towns my Irish ancestors\
  \ left behind to come to America. \nWe rented a car and followed dusty one-lane\
  \ roads, connecting farm to farm, town to town. Stone walls covered in ivy guided\
  \ our path. Sheep and cows dotted the rolling hills. The most beautiful shades of\
  \ green flooded the landscape. The most crips and refreshing air we had ever experienced\
  \ filled our lungs.  Finally, a cemetery appeared on the horizon. Dozens of grave\
  \ stones dotted an overgrown patch of grass inside a stone wall. Some had fallen\
  \ over, most were barely legible after decades of weather and neglect. The church,\
  \ an old stone structure from the 1800s, had almost completely caved in. Ornate\
  \ cement door frames and the partial stone walls were all that remained. Rocks and\
  \ wood piles cluttered the area making it difficult to explore. In all its disrepair\
  \ and abandonment, I was overcome with its beauty. After everything the church had\
  \ been through, it somehow still remains.\n\nI searched the sea of gravestones.\
  \ Name after name passed before my eyes. I wondered who these people were and if\
  \ they ever had visitors. Finally, a familiar name caught my attention. It was my\
  \ family\u2019s last name. Seeing that name etched in stone a world away hit me\
  \ hard. I didn\u2019t know this person, as many generations had passed between us,\
  \ but in that moment I felt as if I did. Alone in an abandoned graveyard half way\
  \ across the world, I was moved to tears. This person that only existed on a genealogy\
  \ paper suddenly became a real person to me. They lived and worked in this tiny\
  \ town right where I was standing. They had hopes and dreams just like I do. In\
  \ that moment, I felt a connection to my past- nothing I had ever felt before. Most\
  \ importantly I felt a connection with myself. I thought of the long line of people\
  \ before me who worked hard to make sure the next generation would thrive. Suddenly,\
  \ my life- my hopes, my dreams, my accomplishments- mattered to me more than it\
  \ ever had before. The past, the present and the future all existed in me at once.\
  \ I made up my mind. No matter what I wasn\u2019t going to wasted a single moment\
  \ of my life. In that moment, I decided I was going to do whatever made me happy.\
  \ \n\nWe wandered down the road to a cluster of buildings. We found the pub, went\
  \ in, bought a beer and sat down. An elderly man asked what we were doing in a town\
  \ that never gets visitors. When we told him our mission he exclaimed, \u201CBurke?\
  \ Well, Paddy Burke lives just up the hill!\u201D"
