Text: "I will never imagine, never dream but only wish that i could touch my own sky\
  \ and feel my both leg on the ground. This country i borned, i grew up and i live\
  \ is no longer a country i expected. Turning back the time wont gonna happen. \n\
  I packed my own stuff with my new life inside my belly, i was pregnant enough to\
  \ bring my new baby to see the world. I will and i have to go to persuit my dream.\
  \ I will get lost, i will be no longer me and i will feel my life that is what inside\
  \ my heart and my mind...\nI visited the country which all dream can be persuit,\
  \ book airflight, book hotel and finding cheapest way to travel around. Studied\
  \ their culture, how they eat, how they wear their clothes, what is allowed to do\
  \ and what is not. \nI was so excited leaving Bali with my thin chlothes and took\
  \ 7 hours flight to Japan and end up having getting cold for winter. I am a girl\
  \ from tropic hot country to dry and cold country. Taxy was so expensive but we\
  \ did arrive in the middle of night..so not much choises. \nDay 1. We have got lost\
  \ as we took wrong bus. Instead of going to town we head up with bus around the\
  \ airport area. Then we took sinkansen to tokyo city. We live travel as a backpacker.\
  \ We took almost a day to find each address. Again we have come from the country\
  \ which transportation limited. But we enjoy every moment seeing new things we havent\
  \ seen before.\nDay 2 and 3. We went to night market where everything sold cheaper\
  \ than mall. We ate local. I bought so many things for gift. Japan as a country\
  \ of sweet, green tea, noodle and sushi. Everything so great. \nDay 4 and 5. We\
  \ took sinkansen leaving tokyo to Osaka. We went to not much that day but again\
  \ we went to night market as always. We have spent all afternoon seeing osaka palace.\
  \ Was a beautiful palace and mix between conventional and modernsm admire me more.\
  \ Japan as always recognize as sophisticated country but always able to keep their\
  \ culture tight.\nDay 6 and 7. We took sinkansen again to kyoto. My goal was to\
  \ see mount fuji the greatest as always. I managed to get the closest place. As\
  \ it was winter, they didnt allow us to get closer as the temp get low to -30. I\
  \ couldnt imagine how cool it was. And never forget to see fushimi inari as 1 of\
  \ the japan icon. And golden palace. Such a beautiful palace. What most admire me\
  \ was the tea drinking culture. Their traditional clothes and their way to drink\
  \ the tea.\nDay 8. We went bavk to tokyo to catch early flight to Bali.\nNothing\
  \ realy admire me but to see different things, different culture, different climate\
  \ and of course different people.\nOne thing i always learn when do travel is how\
  \ we learn their culture and their believes, bond with their culture and find our\
  \ selve become different person in their culture.\nI would like and always dream\
  \ to travel west europe of course to learn and find how their culture impact my\
  \ self to be different person."
