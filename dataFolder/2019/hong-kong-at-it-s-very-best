Text: "Hong Kong, the most happening city of the recent times had always been on my\
  \ wish list, for reasons galore. \n\nI've always had a penchant for travel, exploring\
  \ newer destinations and experiencing their uniqueness. As I took a leap of faith\
  \ and stepped into this happening place, it was very much evident that this sojourn\
  \ is going to be a wonderful time out. \n\nAll set, I chugged out of my hotel to\
  \ discover this city, early in the morning. At the onset, I was greeted by several\
  \ tall and magnanimous buildings, each one a shade different, each one a class apart.\
  \ I couldn't desist, but to sprain my neck on several counts as I gazed through\
  \ the Hong Kong skyline. \n\nAfter walking a bit further, I arrived at the designated\
  \ tram stop (ding-ding for locals) and waited for it's arrival. In a few moments,\
  \ I could glance upon a charming, classy, 1970's single coach car, a popular yesteryear\
  \ means of transport which has been immaculately preserved. I boarded it and had\
  \ a ride of my life. I got down at Ocean Park, a theme park aimed at individuals\
  \ of all ages. From flower park to aquarium to museum to puppet shows to exciting\
  \ rides, this huge man-made island had so much to offer. I left with a heavy heart\
  \ promising only to return some other time.\n\nA visit to Hong Kong without being\
  \ to Disneyland would had been a wasteral. I reached well in time and marched ahead\
  \ of the massive crowds (thanks to my klook bookings) and made a direct entry. I\
  \ was eager and desperate to board the toy train which had a long, curvy and circuitous\
  \ route. A ride on the toy train was enough to bring out the kid in me. The ride\
  \ at  the murphy's mansion  was riveting and thrilling. The cindrella show was a\
  \ stunner. The lionel's cave, pandora's box, shooting spree were all so wonderful\
  \ that wrapping up that evening was quite a difficult task.\n\nMy itenarary would\
  \ had been incomplete without a visit to the Tian-Tan Buddha. The giant size statue\
  \ of Buddha was welcoming  to one and all \nand could be deciphered from several\
  \ miles away. A closer look at the magnanimous statue revealed the intricate details,\
  \ the finesse, the carvings notwithstanding the fact that the lofty idol was constructed\
  \ at such a great height (on a mountain).\n\nAfter paying my obeisance, I moved\
  \ on to another spectacle -The peak tram. The peak tram has an old locomotive engine\
  \ and a coach to accommodate some 100 odd people who are transported to the highest\
  \ point in Hong Kong within a short span of fifteen minutes through a near vertical\
  \ single track. The peak tram journey terminates at the peak tower. The views from\
  \ the peak tower are astonishing and splendid. Hong Kong is best viewed from there\
  \ especially in the evenings when you can see a lot of glitz from the top. You get\
  \ to view the two parts of the region - the city and the island part. The panoramic\
  \ view from the top is quite scintillating. \n\nFlabbergasted - one word and myraid\
  \ of emotions engulfed. \n\nBesides attractions, Hong Kong is home to several businesses\
  \ - from Mitsubishi to Toshiba to Siemens and many more. From the renowned Morgan\
  \ Stanley to the rating giant - Moody's, it's a great business centre and a financial\
  \ hub. Hong Kong has the best of infrastructure i.e well connected, spacious roads,\
  \ a robust public transport system and an efficient electric supply service..\n\n\
  Like all good things must come to an end, it was time to wrap up and bid adieu to\
  \ this wonderful city which had so much to offer. \n\nA pipedream transformed into\
  \ reality, my maiden visit to this vivacious and stunning locale was a rejuvenating\
  \ and breathtaking experience."
