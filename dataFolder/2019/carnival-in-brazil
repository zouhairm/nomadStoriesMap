Text: "Caipirinha. Ipanema. Samba. Who has never heard about these words before? They\
  \ are always connected to Rio de Janeiro, THE Brazilian city. This city has amazing\
  \ sight seeings. In the same place you have all Brazil's historical places and its\
  \ outstanding landscapes. The weather is hot, humid, wet and super sunny. \nFor\
  \ those unaware about Brazil, my country is 519 years old, it was discovey by Pedro\
  \ \xC1lvares Cabral, a Portuguese fellow. On the other hand, Rio de Janeiro city\
  \ is 454 years old and its streets have seen the begging of our firsts steps in\
  \ this modern world. Rio was the capital of Brazil from XVIII century until 1960's\
  \ and it holds many Unesco heritage sites. Nowadays, Rio is most know for its finest\
  \ parties during Carnival time and its beaches. The violence in the favelas is a\
  \ huge problem for its population, but during Carnival I could see police forces\
  \ everywhere. \nWhen walking around Rio you can feel the Carnival vibe all around:\
  \ people with costumes every where you go, from tourists, locals and staffs from\
  \ many different places. It was raining a lot days before Carnival started. My first\
  \ day was very calm. Me and my parents went to Copacabana shoreline to see the \"\
  bloquinhos\" - parties on the street, people usually follow the band that is or\
  \ in a truck or just walking and playing music. Spending Carnival in Rio was my\
  \ mom's dream, and when I saw the smile on her face my heart melted with happiness.\n\
  Next day, I went out with my students to see Sargento Pimenta. They are a band that\
  \ play Beatles songs having samba as its melody. I was in Copacabana and needed\
  \ to go to Flamengo, I went by subway. I was wearing a dark angel costume - a black\
  \ halo, black wings, black skirt, and black bikini top full of glitter, and an intense\
  \ red lipstick. On subway, the trains were full of people with different costumes,\
  \ singing, laughing and dancing, you could see the glitter all over the place. It\
  \ was only a 10 minutes walk from the station to the band, the sun was too strong,\
  \ but people amazing!\nOne thing you need to know about Carnival in Brazil: people\
  \ tend to act more freely, so, if you look in somebody's eyes and feel a connection\
  \ its ok to kiss. Simple as that! Not asking names or age, just a kiss, just for\
  \ fun. And then you two say goodbye and continue doing whatever you were doing before,\
  \ until you find the next kiss. Or you can challenge a pirate to a duel with your\
  \ imaginary swords. Respect among people was present in all aspects; as Lady Gaga\
  \ use to say \"No matter gay, straight, or bi / Lesbian, transgendered life\", you\
  \ are free to express yourself in Carnival.\nAfter some hours there, tired as hell,\
  \ we sat under a tree and heard that another bloquinho was going to begging very\
  \ close to where we were, 15 minutes walk. (just for you to know: people in Rio\
  \ are very friendly, they like to talk a lot, to get to know you, and become friends\
  \ in minutes) We went there to see what was going to happen. Arriving there we could\
  \ see the Trio - a truck that is covered with speakers, and in its top a band keep\
  \ playing to the crowd on the ground. They had thrown blue hats from the top of\
  \ the truck driving people insane (I got one and lost it). In this bloquinho the\
  \ music was Ax\xE9, from Bahia, and some funk. People were fascinated by the music.\
  \ It was extremely hot! In our way back we asked for information on streets, people\
  \ helped us. I went back to my hotel by subway. All super organize. All public servants\
  \ (police officers, subway employees) were very friendly and helpful. I saw many\
  \ people using their cellphones with no problems, but, I have heard about some other\
  \ people that had their cellphones stolen, however, my experience was completely\
  \ ok. \nMany hours dancing, many more experiences. \nIf you want to know more, come\
  \ back tomorrow. Bye. Thanks. Hanna Bueno"
