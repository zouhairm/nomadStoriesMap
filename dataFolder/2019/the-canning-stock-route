Text: "A Leap Into the Unknown\u2026\n \nWe rendezvous\u2019ed in Western Australia\u2019\
  s Kununurra with friends Julie & Ian Robinson. Our next destination was the most\
  \ remote track on Earth,\n\nThe Canning Stock Route.\n\nJune 2018: winter in the\
  \ Southern Hemisphere, but the most comfortable season for a desert journey in Australia.\
  \ The days are warm and sunny; the cool nights clear and starry. Our vehicles were\
  \ fully laden with provisions for a month of exploring along tracks that do not\
  \ fit the description \u2018road\u2019, but meander over and between sand dunes,\
  \ through sparse forests, beside billabongs and salt pans and across rocky \u2018\
  jump-ups\u2019,  in the arid Sandy Desert of Western Australia.\n\nThe Canning Stock\
  \ Route is an extremely remote destination between Halls Creek and Wiluna in Western\
  \ Australia. It was created over a century ago, to facilitate the movement of cattle\
  \ between the Kimberley Region in the north, and the Goldfields. Wells were built\
  \ where the Martu people had known water was available for thousands of years. Now,\
  \ the wells punctuate a desert which is remote, pristine, full of life and full\
  \ of history, and they allow well prepared travellers to explore this stunning region.\n\
  \nThe CSR officially begins (or ends) at Bililuna. An unremarkable red sandy trail\
  \ winds south of this parched village, where we topped up our fuel and water. Almost\
  \ immediately our progress slowed to a meagre 20kph, a pace we were to become accustomed\
  \ to as we travelled south-west. \n\nTwitchers all, we enjoyed seeing unfamiliar\
  \ birds. Brolgas, finches, wood swallows, a hobby-falcon, white-winged fairy wrens.\
  \ Emeralds soared in the sunshine - huge flocks of green budgerigars. Buzzards,\
  \ nankeen kestrels, princess parrots.\n\nCamels appeared on the rutted track and\
  \ high on the dunes: Australia is apparently the only country in the world where\
  \ one can see wild camels. As the Afghan cameleers became redundant, camels were\
  \ released and their descendants now thrive in the Outback.\n\nAt Colvida Soak we\
  \ explored a dry gorge to find ancient indigenous petroglyphs,  and graffiti left\
  \ by  drovers early last century.  A cave system near Guli Lake showed sign of previous\
  \ habitation: rock art decorated the walls. Layer upon layer of history enriches\
  \ this wilderness.\n\nWe camped in swags beneath Snappy Gums or Desert Oak, lulled\
  \ to sleep by the susurration of breeze through the leaves, after delicious campfire\
  \ meals accompanied by quiet conversation and \u2018adult\u2019 beverages. Sometimes\
  \ dingoes prowled nearby, hoping to scavenge some scraps of food. We didn\u2019\
  t feed the wildlife. Sometimes there was ice in the water-bucket by morning, but\
  \ soon the warmth, and the flies! - returned.\n\nSpinifex grows in profusion but\
  \ is deceptive. It looks like fields of wheat with its tall whispy white flowers,\
  \ but is brutal to walk through: needle-like leaves pierce clothes and skin. This\
  \ desert is green. Vegetation against the red sand and blue sky makes for a vibrant\
  \ vista.\n\nAt Well 33 we had to detour away from the Canning Stock Route, due to\
  \ flooding. But to visit the Desert Queen Baths in Karlamilyi (Rudall River) National\
  \ Park was well worth the extra rugged kilometres. Water flows through a deep red\
  \ gorge of falls and icy pools, where vegetation and wildlife thrive. We spent a\
  \ blissful day rock-hopping, exploring and swimming, grateful for the wetsuits we\
  \ wore. Painted finches, rainbow bee eaters, red backed kingfishers \u2026 frogs!\n\
  \nWe were able to rejoin the Canning Stock Route at Georgia Bore, a well fully restored\
  \ with a steel lid and windlass. The nights were bright now with a full moon: the\
  \ starry Milky Way with its \u2018Dark Emu\u2019 no longer visible.\n\nDurba Springs\
  \ appeared like an oasis: a grassy meadow with shady gum trees hemmed by red rocky\
  \ cliffs provided a welcome campsite for a few nights. A lunar eclipse heralded\
  \ the end of our CSR adventure.\n\nOver 22 days, what started out as a bullet point\
  \ on a bucket list, metamorphosed. We immersed ourselves in history, both ancient\
  \ and recent, landscapes, skyscapes and wildlife.\n\nWe\u2019ve challenged our driving\
  \ skills, we\u2019ve explored on foot, rock-hopping through gorgeous gorges, we\u2019\
  ve swum in pristine desert springs, we\u2019ve marvelled at raw beauty, and shared\
  \ campfire companionship.\n\n(We\u2019ve made our peace with dust!)\n\n\nJane Powell\n\
