Text: "It was happening again. I was sitting in a cab, looking alternatively at the\
  \ hills and the valley I was leaving behind while approaching the higher destination.\
  \ Unexpectedly, the journey was also witnessing the changes that I had only heard\
  \ about or seen in the news.\n\nI was visiting Badrinath and Kedarnath soon after\
  \ the floods devastated Uttarakhand in 2013. Multiple theories by environmentalists,\
  \ the state forest department, politicians and people both affected and non-affected\
  \ by the tragedy were playing the blame game. It had been an emotional, intense\
  \ year. I was moving out of my beautiful state of Uttarakhand in North India to\
  \ a dry, polluted city in the west to start a new life. And the mystical hills I\
  \ had been visiting since my childhood now had more dead bodies and broken shelters\
  \ than the pine trees. \n\nI had seen the course of both the rivers alter, the Ganges\
  \ and Alaknanda. Haunting images of the human and animal bodies, gas cylinders,\
  \ bikes, and trees were flashing in my mind. Only a baby elephant could have been\
  \ rescued alive. We all had seen the BBC clip of the Lord Shiva's pristine statue\
  \ being washed away by the fierce waves. Misery and beauty come from the same source.\
  \ They were calling it an 'Act of God'.\n\nI reached Badrinath before dusk, left\
  \ my luggage in the cab and started walking towards the temple town. Many people\
  \ sat on the street. Shivering, sipping tea served by relief volunteers, adjusting\
  \ blankets and trying not to think about the lost possessions, people or hunger.\
  \ There was a peculiar whiff in the chilly wind, a blend of dampness, ginger, tobacco,\
  \ and despair. There was a strong smell of desperation in the pilgrim town otherwise\
  \ visited by thousands every year in hopes of soul searching and redemption. \n\n\
  My go-to restaurant was unusually crowded. At the counter was a line of tourists\
  \ waiting to make that one phone call to the family they had left behind in the\
  \ comfort of home. Some tables had blank faces resting on them, slowly eating the\
  \ food being served. But mostly the place was loud and chaotic. From a distance,\
  \ I recognized the restaurant owner. We exchanged a glance, he approached after\
  \ a few minutes and enquired, 'What makes you visit the place everyone has been\
  \ trying to leave?' I said that the news had the better part of me for a month and\
  \ I wanted to see things in person before finally moving out. I had dodged a certain\
  \ amount of hell, after all. A waiter came to ask him what was to be distributed\
  \ to people for dinner. The restaurant had been serving food to stranded people\
  \ who would also sleep in their hall at night. When I asked him when were they planning\
  \ to wind-up and go back home, he responded, 'Once the old, the women, the children\
  \ and the stranded are transported.' He offered me some soup and bread, refusing\
  \ to take any money in return. Then smiled and said, 'We have enough inventory to\
  \ feed people for a month, and we would hopefully be back home much before the stock\
  \ lasts.'\n\nOutside the restaurant was an old man in a wheelchair, wearing an oxygen\
  \ mask. I asked him if I could escort him somewhere. He pointed towards a couple,\
  \ apparently his son and daughter in law. I politely asked if it was recommended\
  \ for a man his age, to be in that weather, in that situation. The couple informed\
  \ that after surviving the second heart attack, it was his wish to come for this\
  \ pilgrimage and pray for a grandchild. They had been married for six years.\n\n\
  Before retiring at the hotel, I wanted to visit a viewpoint while the Sun was still\
  \ setting. My not so conscious steps took me to the end from where I could see the\
  \ temple, the river, the valley. More lives were at a standstill than in action,\
  \ yet the mountains stood as firm and loyal as ever. Pointing human error in my\
  \ face till I could see the vermillion hues no longer, only a silver lining in the\
  \ sky."
