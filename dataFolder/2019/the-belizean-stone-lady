Text: "Once you start the journey through the Western highway of this small but wonderful\
  \ country called Belize you cannot stop. As soon as you get to her place and spend\
  \ some time with this old lady, who lives near the western border with Guatemala,\
  \ you will always want to come back again. Xunantunich is a magic place almost in\
  \ the antique and picturesque town of Benque Viejo del Carmen where there is hidden\
  \ one of the few ruins of an ancient civilization: The Mayan.\nGetting to Xunantunich\
  \ is a very easy task to accomplish, and the beautiful views that the highway gives\
  \ us are just astonishing, the greener meadows and also the tallest trees that you\
  \ have ever seen. There are no big signs about Xunantunich over the road, so you\
  \ had better watch out and always be aware. By the time, you arrive at the entrance,\
  \ you realize that there are more than three business stands of local people where\
  \ they sell some sort of handcrafts and souvenirs of Belize, specifically from this\
  \ Mayan city. The handcrafts are made from a wide range of materials from jade to\
  \ wood, even some backpacks, and costume jewelry are sold as well. Immediately after\
  \ the local business you can see a hand cracked ferry, used to get through the river\
  \ because of its width and depth. In this kind of ferry, they cross cars, vans,\
  \ taxis, and people, so in less than 3 minutes you are on the other side of the\
  \ Mopan River\u2019s pristine waters. On the other side the uphill rode begins and\
  \ is almost 2 miles through the dense Central American rainforest. If you enjoy\
  \ nature and ancient civilizations this adventure is for you, the colorful landscapes\
  \ and the astonishing Mayan pyramids that lives among the jungle will excite you\
  \ from moment zero.\nOnce there, you must pay a small fee of 10 dollars (totally\
  \ worth it) in the box office to get into the Archaeological Site and the museum,\
  \ both very educational. The museum explains the site itself, dates of construction,\
  \ some Mayan customs, how the site was discovered, etc. Everything in a very eco-friendly\
  \ construction style, mostly wooden, you would never imagine that this kind of places\
  \ are inside of the jungle. Then a short uphill walk waits for you again with stairs\
  \ and tiny steps made of rock and a rustic wooden railing between the tall trees,\
  \ as an aperitive for the main dish.\nAfter all this crossing, there you are in\
  \ front of the \u201CStone Woman\u201D an old lady also known as Xunantunich. The\
  \ modern Mayan name stands for this legend which tells that there is a ghost of\
  \ a woman who appears during the night. She is dressed in white clothes and her\
  \ eyes looks like fireballs. The woman\u2019s ghost goes up the El Castillo\u2019\
  s stairs and disappears into the stone walls. Xunantunich was not a very important\
  \ settlement in the Mayan culture; although is still quite impressive the structures\
  \ that were built in here. The huge space within the structures invites you to relax\
  \ and reflect on the Mayan lifestyle. While you walk by the main corridor you can\
  \ feel in the atmosphere the humidity and the warmth of the jungle mixing with the\
  \ majestic song of the birds. I must tell that is a place like no other. The principal\
  \ edification called \u201CEl Castillo\u201D is a height structure (~40 meters)\
  \ that pretentious arises in front of whoever visit this place. Climbing this Mayan\
  \ world\u2019s wonderful might not be easy, but the reward you get once there is\
  \ simply unforgettable. In this National Archaeological Site if you ask for a tour\
  \ guide, they are very well-trained, and they will tell you all about the site,\
  \ the curiosities, the stories around the place, and even fun facts or recent discoveries\
  \ that the archaeologists have just done.\nOne of the hidden gems that Belize has\
  \ to offer for locals and foreigners who dare to enter their mythical corners. A\
  \ civilization, a legend, a settlement that stopped the time in the middle of nowhere\
  \ in the rainforest. In Belize, people still say that this is one of the most best-kept\
  \ secrets of this young nation."
