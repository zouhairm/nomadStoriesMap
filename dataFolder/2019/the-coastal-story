Text: "Crocodile!! We shouted together as one of our friends was trying to capture\
  \ a shot of a common crane, oblivious of the crocodile nearby. We started on cycles\
  \ from Bhuj inthe morning and this was our first stone enroute. There was a local\
  \ tea shop where we stopped. There was a water body behind with birds and many crocodiles\
  \ ( that we found out later!!)\n\nKutch is one of the most beautiful places in India.\
  \ The place is famous for the Great Rann of Kutch which is adapted desert. Thousands\
  \ of tourists visit the Rann of Kutch every year from November to February. However,\
  \ we chose to cycle around the lesser known and unexplored pathways of Kutch Coastal.\
  \ Our journey started from Bhuj (330 KM's from Ahemdabad), an ideal starting point.\
  \ Bhuj is a beautiful place known for its centuries old palaces, museums and temples.\
  \ It is well connected by Roadways, Railways and Airways. From Bhuj We cycled to\
  \ a place called Mandvi. We rested at a Jain Dharamshala (10kms before Mandvi).\
  \ We had lunch and took a nap before heading to Vijay Vilas Palace and Mandvi beach.\
  \ Mandvi was once a major port of the region. We enjoyed walking along the sea shore\
  \ of Mandvi during the sunset. \n\nThe next day was along ride as we wanted to cover\
  \ Pingleshwar (another untouched and pristine beaches of Kutch Coastal) and then\
  \ reach Naliya where we decide to stay. Riding through traffic free roads, we enjoyed\
  \ the view, as we cycled past windmills and cotton fields on both sides of the road.\
  \ It was more than a 100 km ride on this day. Naliya is a small and busy town. There\
  \ was not much to see and we were exhausted so called it a day. Early next morning,\
  \ we decided to visit the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary. The Great Indian Bustards\
  \ are on the endangered list and there are only 20 odd birds remaining. However,\
  \ we were dissapointed as we couldn't sight the birds. We got back in the saddle\
  \ to ride to Narayan Sarovar, a popular pilgrimage place. Once we reached our hotel,\
  \ we visited the ancient Koteshwar Mahadev temple, the westernmost point of India.\n\
  \nNext day morning, we planned on visiting Lakhpat, before heading to Mata-no-Madh.\
  \ Lakhpat is the western most town of India. It is sparsely populated, but very\
  \ interesting place. The town is enclosed by 18th century fort walls. Beyond the\
  \ fort walls was the border of India and Pakistan. We were lucky to be offered lunch\
  \ at Lakhpat Gurudwara Sahib (a place of worship for the Sikhs), as we really needed\
  \ to re-fuel. The Granthi gave us a quick tour of the place. After spending time\
  \ at Lakhpat, talking to locals, we headed to our stay at Mata-no-Madh. The next\
  \ day we headed back to Bhuj completing 450 KM's of our entire cycle journey. It\
  \ was truly an amazing experience to ride on the Coastal roads - serene beaches,\
  \ cotton fields, windmills and friendly and warm locals."
