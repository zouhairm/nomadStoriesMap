Text: I read a chapter athato ghummakad jighyasa in my school days ... couldn't understand
  the conclusion of the chapter but then very soon I got the chance to visit andman
  nikobar and that was the first trip I came able to relate that chapter to an individual
  life and to know that I just love to explore the places around me...and luckily
  my father was in bank so we had many trips all around India and two other countries
  also...and my father's occupation made me the jighyasu(ambitious) explorer not only
  about the new places but also for any new interesting things...I think travel is
  not only about having a break from one's daily routine life but traveling is also
  somewhere can be the way to get the enlightenment.. travelling makes you a thinker
  a poet a self centered and sincere personality with full of experiences... traveling
  is not about going on a trip with lot of money and all the materialistic thing u
  gotta pack in your bags to have fun...it's all about exploring and finding the real
  ecstasy...and this real fun can only get by the right way of traveling ...for that
  u have to be ready for adventures for uncomfortable situations and very basic things
  one need to carry is the true intention of Discovery and the hunger to know the
  real you....if you have these things then you don't need to carry anything with
  you...even the place doesn't matter ....but the wheather do ....the location do....cause
  one can't feel comfortable at a noisy and danm hot or cold place ...and if one can't
  feel comfortable then it's quite difficult to connect yourself with ur inner soul...and
  if you can't do that then  your traveling is not worthy at all...and if one ask
  about the perfect place for any month of year then India is the perfect one......if
  you are feeling so hot then you can visit to Kashmir and darling etc if you are
  feeling  cold then you can visit some hot places of India like south resion and
  Maharashtra as...then if u r rain lover then you can go to cherrapunji... traveling
  snatches out the fear of any individual...
