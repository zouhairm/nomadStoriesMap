  \ move.\u201D\n  \u201COne more, this is awesome.\u201D\n  \u201CGreg.\u201D\n \
  \ I knew the wet, dirt path we were on was pretty slick.  Of course I knew that.\
  \  I also knew my wife - an amazing woman, but never the most coordinated - was\
  \ nervous about the forest we were in, and the mud path, and the fact that it was\
  \ a slippery, downhill trek.\n  And the elephant.  She was definitely nervous about\
  \ the elephant.\n  The 12,000 pound elephant was plodding down the trail without\
  \ a care in the world thirty feet behind us, and closing.  \n  Twenty-five feet.\
  \  \n  Twenty.\n  \u201CGREG.\u201D\n  This was a great photo op - my wife and I,\
  \ covered in mud, the elephant bearing down on us - but she had a point.  I put\
  \ the camera away and we both crunched through vegetation to get to the side and\
  \ out of the way, letting the behemoth lumber past us down the path and towards\
  \ the rushing river below.\n  We were in the north of Thailand, in the hills around\
  \ Chiang Mai, and we were helping take care of an elephant for a day.  We\u2019\
  d wanted to as soon as we heard such a thing was possible.  We researched it a ton.\n\
  \  Elephants used to be mistreated fairly regularly in Thailand, either by the logging\
  \ industry or the tourism industry.  Elephants don\u2019t naturally do things like\
  \ pull trees or give rides or paint pictures.  And so they have to be \u201Cbroken\u201D\
  , usually at a very young age, using incredibly brutal techniques involving chains\
  \ and nails and immobilization and cruelty.  It\u2019s horrifying.  Don\u2019t google\
  \ it.\n  Thankfully, the tide is turning in Thailand, and there are more than a\
  \ few organizations that rescue elephants from their previous lives.  Tourists can\
  \ now go and simply hang out while the elephants do, well, elephanty things.  Eat.\
  \  Walk through the jungle.  Take a mud bath.  Wash off in the river.\n  All of\
  \ that - which we did with them - was an unreal experience that we\u2019ll treasure\
  \ for the rest of our lives.\n  We chose The Elephant Nature Park, which has a slew\
  \ of glowing reviews online.  (A word of advice: these experiences book up weeks\
  \ and months in advance)  We ended up spending the day in a small hill village that\
  \ used to use elephants for logging.  Elephant Nature Park had convinced them that\
  \ there was more money simply treating the elephants humanely and letting tourists\
  \ hang out with them, and it seemed to be working.  The industry is thriving, and\
  \ the villagers are benefiting.\n  An hour\u2019s van drive from Chiang Mai through\
  \ the gorgeous Thai countryside (a nice bonus), and we arrived in the village -\
  \ really just a few houses in the middle of the forest.  We got out of the van with\
  \ the other people in the small group and there, right in front of us, were four\
  \ gorgeous, huge elephants.\n  No chains.  No ropes.  No bullhooks (a nasty stick\
  \ with a hook on it, traditionally used to control them).  Just elephants and their\
  \ unarmed mahouts (caretakers), waiting for us.\n  We hand-fed them bananas and\
  \ mango.  They ate everything in sight (did I mention 12,000 lbs?)\n  We walked\
  \ through the forest next to them.  They seemed fairly indifferent to us scampering\
  \ around them.  They didn\u2019t really stop if you were in front of them, so we\
  \ learned to scamper effectively.\n  We walked them to a giant pit filled with mud\
  \ - a giant pit filled with mud is a Four Season\u2019s Spa to an elephant - and\
  \ they gleefully lumbered in.  We followed and slathered them with mud.  They elephants\
  \ laid down and luxuriated.  I got dirtier than I\u2019ve ever been in my life and\
  \ it was amazing.\n  The elephants then lumbered out of the mud bath and through\
  \ the forest again, downhill now, to a rushing river.  We all dove in and happily\
  \ washed the behemoths off.  We threw water on them.  The elephants sprayed us with\
  \ their trunks.  No one in the group could stop smiling.\n  Before we knew it, the\
  \ day was over.  It felt like an hour.  We got back in the van as the elephants\
  \ and their mahouts disappeared into the forest."
