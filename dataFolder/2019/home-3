Text: "\u201CI am so sorry Jessica, but she died two years ago.\u201D  I stagger backwards\
  \ tears streaming down my face.  I look down trying to control my response.  \u201C\
  Keep yourself together in front of your clients,\u201D I tell myself while placing\
  \ my shaky hands under my thighs. \n\nI had only photographed her for minutes years\
  \ ago deep in the forests of Java, Indonesia. I didn\u2019t even know her name.\
  \  \n\nBut my connection to her defies the laws of time, place and dimension.  \n\
  \nSometimes, in my dreams she will appear with her brown eyes, faded pink jacket\
  \ splattered with mud and her blue rimmed rice paddy hat.  She takes my hand and\
  \ leads me down a jagged mountain range. Every so often she glances back with a\
  \ reassuring smile. I always trust she will lead me in the right direction. Hand\
  \ in hand. \n\nIn my working life, I stare at her portrait every day. It hangs on\
  \ the wall next to computer attached by a fraying piece of white duct tape reminding\
  \ me with clarity of the time we met in her rice paddy field. \n\nShe glances up\
  \ after stabbing her pitchfork into the wet brown soil and notices me standing on\
  \ the muddy edge of the field with my camera. She giggles tilting her straw hat\
  \ back exposing her face and white teeth smile.  Her energy is infectious. I lowered\
  \ myself into the mud, dirtying my pants up to my thighs. I feel the cold water\
  \ through my shoes soaking my socks between my toes.  We stand eye to eye unable\
  \ to communicate with language.  Her gaze whispers secrets in milliseconds.  I grab\
  \ her callused hands and squeeze them. Woman to woman, sister to sister, soul to\
  \ soul.   I step back and take the photograph. \n\nFour years later, I am finally\
  \ back in Indonesia for another photography assignment, but she is gone. I want\
  \ to tell someone who loves her how important she is to me. I ask my guide if we\
  \ can try and find her family over the next four days. He nods yes while passing\
  \ me a cup of warm tea. \n\nThe evening breeze hits my face and the light is starting\
  \ to break golden.  In the distance, there is a girl walking down a narrow path\
  \ wearing a brown hijab and a long red dress. Instinctually, I know she would be\
  \ a great photograph.  It is my last evening on assignment and still no signs of\
  \ the woman\u2019s family. Every knock on a door is returned with silence, every\
  \ question of their whereabouts answered with a shrug. \n\nWe walk down the narrow\
  \ path trying to catch up with the young girl.  The path forks, and the girl vanished.\
  \  I know in my gut we need to continue right down a hill that curves along the\
  \ mountains edge.  Down, down, down we go until we are greeted with the sounds of\
  \ laughter, and then a woman with a very long stick trying to remove fruit from\
  \ a tree. Another woman emerges wearing a yellow patterned dress precariously carrying\
  \ flowerpots. Their faces are luminous and I feel instantly at peace. \n\n\u201C\
  Can you find out their names and ask if I can take their photographs, please,\u201D\
  \ I ask my guide.  He begins the introduction process, and I watch him as he calmly\
  \ explains our assignment. \n\nWhen they respond, his shoulders tense and he looks\
  \ at me, \u201CJessica, these are the sisters of the woman you photographed. The\
  \ girl with brown hijab is her granddaughter and this is her village.\u201D  He\
  \ looks at me again, \u201CDo you think she guided you here?\u201D.\n\nI drop to\
  \ my knees sobbing. Her sisters move to my side and together we share this embrace\
  \ to mourn our loss. \n \nHand in hand. She led me home."
