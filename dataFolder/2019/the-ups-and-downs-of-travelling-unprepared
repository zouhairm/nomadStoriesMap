Text: "\u201CDidn\u2019t you bring a waterproof jacket?\u201D I\u2019m asked by my\
  \ Austrian friend while we run from the airport doors to our tour bus to avoid the\
  \ rain. We just landed in Iceland and there\u2019s rain forecasted for each day\
  \ here, while I don\u2019t have a waterproof jacket. It\u2019s at this exact moment\
  \ that I realise I\u2019ve made a huge mistake that I\u2019ll have to deal with\
  \ for the next five days. This is how I learned the ups and downs of travelling\
  \ unprepared.\n\nI spent an exchange semester in Oslo while I was at university\
  \ and a few months in, my roommate and I decide to go on a tour to Iceland. As I\u2019\
  m packing my bag I remember realising that my winter coat is not waterproof. I\u2019\
  m from Australia where winter basically doesn\u2019t exist, so my knowledge of winter\
  \ clothing is minimal. Since I was going to be living in Norway for autumn and winter,\
  \ I bought a winter coat, not realising that it had no waterproofing at all. I didn\u2019\
  t want to buy a new coat just for a five-day trip to Iceland. Instead, I decided\
  \ that my current coat would be enough, and surely it won\u2019t rain that much.\
  \ I was wrong. \n\nAfter a night in Reykjavik, we begin our first day driving to\
  \ Arnarstapi, a small yet picturesque village in the Snaefellsnes peninsular. This\
  \ is a popular tourist destination for the amazing views of unique cliff faces and\
  \ an arch rock formation. Unfortunately, as soon as we start to drive, it starts\
  \ to rain.  \n\nLooking out the window of the bus, I\u2019m immediately struck with\
  \ just how different the landscape is here. Everything is unique, from the plants\
  \ to the terrain, it\u2019s almost like stepping foot onto a different planet. I\
  \ like this uniqueness. It screams of new things to discover and sparks excitement\
  \ for the whole trip, despite the rain threatening to ruin my spirits.\n\nAlthough\
  \ I didn\u2019t come prepared with a suitable waterproof coat, I did manage to find\
  \ a reusable rain poncho in the airport. I tear open the package and unfold the\
  \ poncho only to realise it\u2019s quite small. It\u2019s a children\u2019s size\
  \ rain poncho. After a moment of profound hatred at my prior self for my lack of\
  \ preparedness, I decide that I\u2019m wearing this poncho regardless. I paid for\
  \ it, so I might as well use it. I find the arms and neck and tear the plastic to\
  \ make them bigger until I can fit the poncho over my coat. I\u2019m finally ready\
  \ to explore the area.\n\nSo, I\u2019m standing in the rain surrounded by beautiful\
  \ views unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen before, wearing a kids-size rain poncho\
  \ with slits torn into the arms so I could fit into it. Deep down I know that it\u2019\
  s not really preventing me from getting wet at all. In fact, it\u2019s probably\
  \ doing a worse job than a simple bin liner would. But I don\u2019t really care\
  \ because I\u2019m on a hike in Iceland seeing things I never thought I\u2019d get\
  \ the chance to see. It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m getting wet. It doesn\u2019\
  t matter that I can\u2019t feel my toes because we had to walk through slushy ice\
  \ to get back to the bus. It doesn\u2019t matter that my only pair of jeans and\
  \ boots are now soaking wet and will be for the rest of the day. I\u2019m happy\
  \ despite these issues.\n\nI went on a trip to Iceland without knowing what weather\
  \ to expect, but I didn\u2019t anticipate a life lesson to come from this lack of\
  \ preparation. I learned that it\u2019s alright to not know what\u2019s going to\
  \ happen on a trip, because that\u2019s where so many great experiences and stories\
  \ come from. The moments that haven\u2019t been planned, that let you experience\
  \ the city in a way that\u2019s not possible with a strict schedule. For me, this\
  \ trip showed that I was capable of improvising and that even if it didn\u2019t\
  \ work out how I thought, it was an amazing experience regardless. \n\nIt\u2019\
  s not until I get back to the bus that I realise all my photos at Arnastarpi will\
  \ forever be marred with that gaudy blue poncho."
