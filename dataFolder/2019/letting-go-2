Text: "I\u2019ll warn you upfront - this story is a little about Spain, but mostly\
  \ about me.\n\nIt begins in Chicago on the 18th of January, 2019. My mother had\
  \ just bid me a tearful goodbye before security at O\u2019Hare. She texted me later\
  \ to complain that I hadn\u2019t looked back at her once. \n\nSince the government\
  \ was shutdown and TSA wasn\u2019t coming to work, it had been a painful grind through\
  \ two hours of lines. We were in the midst of another Polar Vortex, and the temperatures\
  \ had dropped to 50 below. There was delicious uncertainty on whether the plane\
  \ could take off in the extreme weather. \n\nI had just ended the lease on my apartment,\
  \ my relationship, and my job of three years. My life was in boxes in a storage\
  \ unit outside of city limits. I was alive. \n\nI had purchased the cheapest ticket\
  \ available, keenly aware of every dollar and cent I\u2019d stockpiled in the years\
  \ since I\u2019d left college. The airline was so bare-bones that they didn\u2019\
  t even provide water free of charge. It didn\u2019t matter to me. I could become\
  \ a camel to make it to Spain.\n\nI sat, wide awake, through my red eye. I can\u2019\
  t tell you what I was feeling in those hours. It was somewhere between elation and\
  \ euphoria.\n\nWhen I arrived in Madrid, I made conversation with a Norwegian man\
  \ in the bunk across from me for a few hours until night fell. My energy was drained\
  \ from the effort it had taken me to find my way through Madrid\u2019s metro system\
  \ and then slog through the rain, asking passerbys for directions to the hostel\
  \ in rusty Spanish.\n\n As I lay in bed that evening, deep anxiety about the security\
  \ of everything I\u2019d left behind overwhelmed me. I began to feel so wretched\
  \ and alone that drawing breath felt like a struggle between one moment and the\
  \ next. The only thing that kept me in that bunk was the prospect of the shame I\u2019\
  d feel returning home from my grand adventure after a single day. \n\nI could tell\
  \ you that the liveliness and energy of Madrid wiped away my loneliness. But since\
  \ this is my story, I\u2019ll tell you the truth. Although I was in love with Madrid,\
  \ the wretched feeling persisted in the gaps between wonder.\n\nIt reared up everytime\
  \ I entered a new city, leaving behind a place that I had just begun to love and\
  \ felt ripped out at the roots from, as I left behind people who had just begun\
  \ to share the same inside jokes, as the prospect of finding my footing in a new\
  \ city loomed ahead of me. \n\nI was frustrated with myself. My trip was not unique\
  \ in 2019. Although I liked to imagine myself as one of Kerouac\u2019s beatnik contemporaries,\
  \ Hemingway\u2019s aimless expatriates, or the counterculture youth Didion found\
  \ in San Francisco, it\u2019s very common to quit your job to see the world these\
  \ days. Instagram is lousy with travel #influencers and bloggers. I had read Potts\u2019\
  \ Vagabonding and chatted with Digital Nomads that had been on the road for years.\
  \ I knew many people personally who had travelled long term. I considered myself\
  \ fierce and independent. Was I the only one who felt this way?\n\nThere was no\
  \ dramatic epiphany on the banks of the Guadalquivir or atop the peaks of the Sierra\
  \ Nevada that erased the wretched feeling. Each day was less of a labor than the\
  \ day before. Slowly, I regained my initial exhilaration. Saying goodbye to people\
  \ and places that I may never see again, or at least never the same way again, gradually\
  \ became easier. The excitement of seeing Granada carried me from Sevilla, and Valencia\
  \ made parting with M\xE1laga relatively painless.\n\nI thought I had let go when\
  \ I left behind my home, but I had still been grasping for that stability with each\
  \ plane, bus, and train. In the end, I stopped looking back. As I\u2019d explained\
  \ to my mother at the airport, it didn\u2019t mean that I loved what I\u2019d left\
  \ behind any less. Everything I wanted was just ahead of me."
