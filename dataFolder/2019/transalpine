Text: "I joined those eight strangers trekking because of having run into the only\
  \ other Romanian in Grenoble that I would befriend. We cycled our way into friendship\
  \ him and I, until one morning all but two of them got off their bikes and we started\
  \ walking uphill from where I lived. We met the steepness of the climb with excitement\
  \ at first, eyes locked on the city, on that perpetual cloud of smog suspended above\
  \ it, about as high as we were. Grenoble sits in a rocky bucket and we were beginning\
  \ to step on its edge.\nI gathered my usual bouquet, small colorful lonely mountain\
  \ flowers, the path was now easy. Deceptively so, our eyes soon discovered, just\
  \ as we began on a descent, which, although a momentary joy, had as abrupt a dissipation\
  \ as the climb in front of us. It was the parachutes now populating our visual field,\
  \ originating from atop, that both cast and lifted the whistling spell of leisurely\
  \ walking in the Alps.\nWe sweat and paused, sighed and pushed on, catching our\
  \ breaths and then losing their trace again until we could finally sit together\
  \ on the flowery grass of the fort ruins overlooking the city, standing silent witness.\
  \ When we continued on, refreshed, skipping on the trail, we joked from above about\
  \ the sea of pools and suburban homes visible on our right, les richoux. \nAnother\
  \ descent later, the muscles on our legs sore, we reached a little alpine village.\
  \ The day and our stamina were ending and so too were hopes of reaching the refuge\
  \ we had planned to sleep in. Resigned, increasingly aware of how parts of our group\
  \ tended to lag behind, we had a gas tank lit dinner in the village park. Sitting\
  \ around on the football field like we were, half of us looking at the summit we\
  \ were reaching for, the other half with our views on the far away city half obscured\
  \ by a vigorous, happily placed chestnut tree, it seemed for the longest time like\
  \ we forgot about having to sleep somewhere. But night was beginning to fall, the\
  \ food made us mellow and, over a glass of wine in the village pub, some of us thought\
  \ themselves as brave as to lay their sleeping bags outside. We felt brave together.\
  \ Luckily, just as we were toughening up for this exploit, mass ended in the church\
  \ across the road and a girl in our group thought to try her luck asking locals\
  \ about lodging nearby. A rapid, engulfing stream of alpine hospitality followed.\
  \ We were invited to spend the night, all ten of us, in an old couple\u2019s rather\
  \ large cabin. It was mostly empty, on the count of their three children living\
  \ elsewhere in the world, which they obviously resented given their attempts at\
  \ jokes on the subject and the untouched state of the upstairs rooms we got to share.\
  \ They served tea in little bowls and dried apples proudly home-made, I bonded with\
  \ them over the up-keeping of honey bees and then we went to sleep. It was only\
  \ after a chatty breakfast and a group photo that we left the next morning, rediscovering\
  \ our trail, winding uphill through the rural landscape, cows, plows and manure.\n\
  We reached the refuge only to discover it would have been impossible to spend the\
  \ night there anyway and so we carried on, lunching on a sun lit slope so high up\
  \ that we could see for miles. The geography seemed to be converging towards the\
  \ far off city we had left behind, the distance improbable, would we have to walk\
  \ all the way back again? We never did reach that summit, Chamechaude, it was icy\
  \ and forbidding and we enjoyed running up on the last patches of grass before the\
  \ rocky peak instead. We raced over beer on our way back, lazily took a bus to the\
  \ city and regrouped in the very center, Grenoble\u2019s own pub in the park, la\
  \ Bobine. There on the porch, beer in hand, red cheeked and happy, among unknown\
  \ friends old and new, speaking every language, not even the occasional running\
  \ mouse bothered us. We laughed the night away."
