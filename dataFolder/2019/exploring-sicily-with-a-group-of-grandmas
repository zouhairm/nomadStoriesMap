Text: "I have always loved to travel and, since I was a little kid, I would take every\
  \ opportunity that I had to go someplace new. Growing up, this need of discovering\
  \ new places  - Wanderlust, using the clich\xE9 word - took me to Italy with a group\
  \ of grandmas.\n\nJust at the beginning of my journalism undergrad courses in Brazil,\
  \ my, at the time, eighty years old grandma, Branca, asked me to join her and some\
  \ other elder ladies in a trip to Rome and Sicily. The yes came right away, as the\
  \ fingers searched Sicily on google just to find the most beautiful scenarios -\
  \ and some mafia movies.\n\nAs the trip became closer, I started to worry what would\
  \ be like travelling with a group of around twenty ladys in their eighties. Would\
  \ I be able to get to know the cities or I would be stuck in a tourist bus? One\
  \ way or another I would be a opportunity to travel. However, I didn't expect to\
  \ find out that the ladies wore so full of joy and youth that the tour bus became\
  \ a karaoke party every time one grandma picked the microphone, that should be used\
  \ to make announcements, to sing a old brazilian pop song.\n\nAside from the group,\
  \ that I later found out to be amazing, Italy really struck a impression on me,\
  \ the best one, should be noted. Even after seeing almost every picture on google,\
  \ going to the place in real life showed me such beautiful villages with colorful\
  \ houses built in a way that wore almost carved into the mountains that even the\
  \ best taken picture couldn't replicate what I was seeing.\n\nLooking back, I realize\
  \ that the little town of Taormina was by far the place that made me feel like I\
  \ wouldn't see such beauty in a while. Built on top of a huge mountain an overlooking\
  \ the see, this small village was just the gift that I didn't expect to find in\
  \ the coast of Sicily. Everywhere I looked I felt like I was daydreaming kept in\
  \ this greek style city that was almost hand carved in between the see and the mountains.\n\
  \nAs I said, the photos don't make justice to Taormina, so the brain try hard to\
  \ remember every detail of that village. In the meantime, while I stop to look at\
  \ the pictures to try and recreate the best gift that my grandmother could give\
  \ me, I can only advise you to visit Sicily and also to travel with a group of old\
  \ ladies - the can also be great travellers and amazing unexpected surprise."
