Text: "Did you ever wonder about the mythical world of \u2018The Mummy\u2019?\n\n\
  Did you ever wonder about being a Librarian because of \u2018The Mummy\u2019?\n\n\
  Did you ever wonder If you could be the one saving the world from \u2018The Mummy\u2019\
  ?\n\nChances are that you definitely did and my dear, fellow human being, I am with\
  \ you on that train along with thousands of other people.\n\nOne of the things on\
  \ my bucket list was to \u2018Visit the Pyramids\u2019 with a doodle of them on\
  \ the front page. You see, I am dedicated to this list.\nSo, I found a volunteer\
  \ project that could benefit me and give me a wonderful opportunity to go to Egypt.\
  \ My friend and I hopped on the plane and landed at the magical hour of 2 am. And\
  \ it all went downhill from there.\n\nThe accommodation was shit, the work was uninteresting\
  \ and Egypt- not really what \u2018The Mummy\u2019 painted.\n\nBut it gave me an\
  \ opportunity to meet countless nationalities, eat food I have never heard about\
  \ and make friends for life. I will never forget the vacation cum internship that\
  \ gave me a chance to understand a culture completely different from mine and let\
  \ me actually live close to the everyday life in Egypt. \nIt gave me a chance to\
  \ fall in love with language and diversity all over again. \nIt gave me a chance\
  \ to learn the things about myself that I never knew existed. \nIt gave me a chance\
  \ to get lost and not worry about finding my way back.\n\nAnd I did go to the pyramids\
  \ which I am definitely pretty smug about. I remember saying to myself, \u2018I\u2019\
  m miserable, but I am glad I\u2019m miserable in Egypt\u2019."
