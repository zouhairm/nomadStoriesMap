Text: "- 08/02/2018\n9 am. International Porto Alegre Airport, destiny: Gramado. This\
  \ is the story about my first trip with my boyfriend. Arriving in the city we saw\
  \ the most gorgeous streets and houses that we ever seen (the city has a European\
  \ style mainly Italian, German and Portuguese, since they were the main immigrants).\
  \ At the hotel we bought the next day\u2019s tour and that was where the biggest\
  \ luck of the trip happened: we won a tour of the cities of Gramado and Canela (nearby\
  \ city). It is important to say that our hotel is located in the suburb so we needed\
  \ to take a bus to downtown. Arriving there we met the main streets of Gramado and\
  \ seek for somewhere to have dinner, meanwhile a small statue of a red dragon hanging\
  \ in a store caught my attention when a woman came out of the restaurant inviting\
  \ us to eat their all-you-can Japanese food \u2013 the best we have ever tasted,\
  \ with a Gramado\u2019s beer!\n- 08/03/2018\nThe following day was the tour that\
  \ we bought for the steam train ride inaugurated in 1919 which had Italian music,\
  \ dance performances and sometimes the train stopped at the stations where there\
  \ were tastings of juice and wine produced in the region \u2013 a totally immersive\
  \ experience! After that we headed to the city of Garibaldi to visit a typical food\
  \ shop, then we went to a wine and champagne shop, we were very surprised when the\
  \ receptionist opened some bottles with a sword! Across the street we went to a\
  \ homemade chocolate shop where we could see the manual production of how everything\
  \ is done. Next stop: Italian epic, an interactive museum that tells the story of\
  \ Italian immigration through scenarios, actors and a movie. The last stop was at\
  \ a winery where we tasted different types of wines and saw closely how the vineyard\
  \ is planted.\n-08/04/2018\nOn the third day we took the Gramado/Canela tour we\
  \ won. The first stop was at the crystal factory where we saw how the pieces are\
  \ made and molded, a totally unique and passionate experience, worth seeing up close!\
  \ Then we went to another shop to sample cheeses and wines, then we went to the\
  \ Caracol park and took the cable car to the waterfall (you could only see from\
  \ a distance). Then we went to the Minimundo, a large site with mockups of existing\
  \ buildings around the world with small shaped people telling a story.\n-08/05/2018\n\
  On Sunday we went to snowland, a park where it manufactures snow with a several\
  \ attractions made by snow and ice. We arrived at 10:30 am and left at 5:00 pm without\
  \ feeling the time go by. After entering we rented clothes for the big space with\
  \ a temperature of minus 3 degress where it snows and has the attractions like the\
  \ ski, snowboard and a mountain of snow to go down with a float. Besides it has\
  \ an ice skating rink and the food court. We rented the equipment for snowboarding\
  \ and used all the other attractions except for ski. At dinner we went to a fondue\
  \ restaurant to warm up on the cold day.\n-08/06/2018\nOn the penultimate day we\
  \ visited all the places we did not get on the other days. The first was the wax\
  \ museum and the Harley-Davidson bar, we had lunch and went to the second place\
  \ that was in a chocolate factory where he tells the story of cocoa to the development\
  \ of chocolate by means of dolls. There was a main dummy that presented all the\
  \ scenes and reminded us of a trash horror movie, we laughed a lot! Then we decided\
  \ to walk to Santa's village which is a distance of 2.6 km from the hotel but we\
  \ gave up on entering as we wanted to go to the black lake so we walked another\
  \ 2.8 km and when we arrived we rented a pedal boat and did more exercise, it was\
  \ the most we did in our lives! After that we went to eat in the downtown and then\
  \ decided to return by bus to the hotel.\n-08/07/2018\nLast day: time to go home!"
