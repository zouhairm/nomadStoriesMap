Text: "It was dusk. Hovering just outside the grasp of darkness surrounding the giant\
  \ Los Arcos caves, we sat in our kayaks and quietly treaded the water with our paddles.\
  \ \u201CAny minute now!\u201D The excursion guide\u2019s voice broke out over the\
  \ still of the ocean. I watched the water ripple like silk between my friends\u2019\
  \ kayaks. We were a mile off the shore of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and I was restless.\n\
  \nUp until that moment, I had my doubts about agreeing to come on this trip. After\
  \ a tumultuous start to the new year, I had dipped into my savings to book my flight\
  \ to Mexico. What was I thinking? Two days into this getaway and I couldn\u2019\
  t enjoy a dip in the ocean or the comforting feel of the sun on my skin without\
  \ the stress of what was waiting for me at home overpowering my contentment. \n\n\
  But then it happened. One by one, my friends started to break out into gasps and\
  \ squeals of delight. They pointed at the water directly in front of them. I swiveled\
  \ my head from one side of the kayak to the other but only saw my reflection staring\
  \ up at me from the black abyss.\n\n \u201CI don\u2019t see anything,\u201D I remember\
  \ blurting out in frustration. My friend, Mo, who was sitting at the front of the\
  \ kayak, turned back to smile at me. \u201CLook closer. They\u2019re there.\u201D\
  \ \n\nI followed the direction of her finger and willed myself to see something,\
  \ anything. My friends continued to hoot and holler. I shifted in my seat. \n\n\
  That\u2019s when I saw them. All at once, I couldn\u2019t blink without seeing hundreds\
  \ of bioluminescent plankton twinkling around me on the surface of the water. The\
  \ marine algae drifted lazily by me and lit up the ocean like a starry night. We\
  \ were engulfed in what looked like sparkling fairy dust.\n\nI placed my hand in\
  \ the water and watched as a few plankton floated into my palm. When I tried to\
  \ scoop one up, however, the algae slipped through my fingers and back into the\
  \ water. I followed the plankton for as long as I could before it blended back in\
  \ with its gleaming crowd of friends.\n\nWe gradually drifted back to the shore,\
  \ the plankton acting as a guiding light, if you will. I felt myself breathe freely\
  \ for the first time in days. The pounding in my chest seemed to get quieter. My\
  \ body loosened the rope it had wrapped around itself. Being out of my head and\
  \ unequivocally present for the first time in a very long time was a shocking welcome\
  \ relief for my body. \n\nTravel has a way of reminding you of the natural beauty\
  \ of the world; a world where the stressors of modern life seem to be just a tiny\
  \ organism drifting out of reach in the water. As every step through the sand took\
  \ us further away from The Big Blue, I smiled, knowing I had discovered my very\
  \ own antidote to the blue screens waiting for me back at home."
