Text: "The Flight\n\nSo after adopting that cliche proverb \u2018Carpe Diem\u2019\
  \ and quitting my job, I jetted off to Bangkok with a little help from a great student\
  \ holiday company called STA Travel (www.statravel.com) - a global travel agent\
  \ who provide discounts to people under the age of 26.\n\nWe opted to layover for\
  \ a few hours in Muscat, Oman (the cheapest route). At the time, this country was\
  \ dubbed as the \u2018next\u2019 Dubai due to it\u2019s extraordinary oil wealth\
  \ and as of 2016, travellers to Muscat had increased by 18% compared to the previous\
  \ year, to over 5million people.\n\nToday, Oman has become a thriving metropolis.\
  \ It is now brimming with tonnes of luxury hotels and idyllic picturesque beaches.\
  \ So if you decide to fly Oman Air like I did (which did not disappoint whatsoever),\
  \ make sure to spend a few days there rather than hours and see what this new kid\
  \ on the block has to offer.\n\nDay 1: Khao San Road\n\nAt this point in my life,\
  \ my only real experience of a holiday, was an All Inclusive resort hotel destination.\
  \ Lounging by the pool, with my most difficult decision each day being how many\
  \ cuisines I could try at the buffet.\n\nSo in comparison, Khao San Road is the\
  \ craziest, most \u2018anything goes\u2019 attack on the senses place, absolutely\
  \ jam packed into a fairly small street.\n\nIt is probably the only place in the\
  \ whole entire world where you could: Eat a Scorpion on a stick, \u2018enjoy\u2019\
  \ a questionable Ping Pong show, drink a shot of Whisky laced with Snake Venom AND\
  \ get a Mike Tyson-esque tattoo all at the same time!!\n\nDay 2: Sightseeing and\
  \ The Grand Palace\n\nDay 2 was spent paying the equivalent of \xA32 to be chauffered\
  \ by Tuk Tuk all day courtesy of a very friendly Thai fellow who could see we were\
  \ tourists from a mile away.\n\nThe architecture was stunning and so varied, I was\
  \ blown away. Thailand has such a rich history and one of the few remaining countries\
  \ with a Royal Family. Photographs of the Monarchy adorn almost every building and\
  \ they are beloved by the Thai people. Make sure to wear appropriate clothing to\
  \ visit any temple as the Buddhist Monks are very strict in this regard and will\
  \ not permit entry to anyone showing their legs, or even shoulders. Trust me, you\
  \ wouldn\u2019t want to miss out on these works of art due to a poor wardrobe decision!\n\
  \nDay 3: The Boat Canal Bus & Chinatown\n\nWith Vietnam on the horizon and the country's\
  \ strict Visa restrictions, we decided to get our passports stamped at the Vietnamese\
  \ Embassy, rather than doing so in the UK. You receive a 28 day Visa but have to\
  \ arrive on the day you have had stamped in your passport \u2013 there would be\
  \ nothing worse than an unforeseen circumstance causing you to miss unnecessary\
  \ days in Vietnam because you were TOO organised!\n\nNevertheless, we didn\u2019\
  t want this to be a chore so our chosen mode of transport was a quaint little canal\
  \ boat which was the equivalent of a local bus in the UK. A lovely lady with incredible\
  \ spacial awareness and reactions, traverses the edges of the boat collecting fares\
  \ whilst avoiding the low bridges and other obstacles along the ever winding routes\
  \ through the city.\n\nWe ultimately decided to spend our evening in the world famous\
  \ Chinatown \u2013 as much as I enjoy exploring menus and taking in the buzz of\
  \ each restaurant, I had already chosen our eating spot thanks to its glowing reputation.\
  \ Well in fact there our TWO rival seafood restaurant situated directly opposite\
  \ eachother.\n\nIt was a hilarious sight, like the modern day Capulets and Montagues\
  \ \u2013 2 families, accomplished in their fields, in direct competition with eachother.\
  \ The only difference I could see were the uniforms \u2013 the helpful and friendly\
  \ staff wore Green in one restaurant and Red in the other! We chose to dine at Lek\
  \ and Rut for the sole reason that we are both left handed and as they are located\
  \ on the left\u2026.well it was an easy choice.\n\nCurry, Tom Yum, Oysters \u2013\
  \ the place had it all and everything was absolutely delicious."
