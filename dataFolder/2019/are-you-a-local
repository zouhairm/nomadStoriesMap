Text: "\u201CLock Trump up! Lock Trump up!\u201D\n\nThe bass is bumping but on the\
  \ crowded Venice Boardwalk, I can\u2019t initially identify the source of this Anti-President\
  \ Jam. Then, I see a dreadlocked black man with a sly Watergate stroll  pulling\
  \ a Radio Flyer red wagon loaded with unsold CDs and  booming speakers aimed at\
  \ 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. This unexpected political presence seems both out of\
  \ place and at home amidst the Boardwalk\u2019s two dollar paintings, bikini-clad\
  \ Bird riders, open carry marijuana practitioners, \u201CThis Ass Ain\u2019t Gonna\
  \ Spank Itself\u201D T-Shirts and an unlicensed therapist who sits  by a sign that\
  \ reads: Shitty Advice  $1.\n\nVenice is a small town in a big city where tourists\
  \ stand out like clouds. Locals often lead with \u201CAre you a local?\u201D \n\n\
  I wasn\u2019t a local when I came to visit my Dad on a summer vacation that never\
  \ quite ended.  Now I\u2019m the one asking, \u201CAre you a local?\u201D As a frequent\
  \ traveler, I enjoy experiencing places with a certain level of nakedness\u2014\
  it upgrades the possibility of something interesting happening.  You\u2019ve heard,\
  \ \u201CRiding Dirty.\u201D  I \u201CTravel Vulnerable.\u201D I am exposed to new\
  \ environments in a way that is a little edgy and keeps me on edge.  This approach\
  \ is a natural response to my image conscious generation that makes me want to play\
  \ it safe. I resist with my eyes, ears and heart wide open. \n\nI have always loved\
  \ the sight of a new city, the smell of new beginnings.This is the only city that\
  \ gave me whiplash. I\u2019m constantly hearing different languages: French, Italian,\
  \ Swahili, Spanish and Amharic my native Ethiopian tongue. It\u2019s surreal for\
  \ me to speak Amharic on Venice Beach but it happens because this beach hood (or\
  \ hood at the beach as it\u2019s referred to by some locals because of its edginess).\
  \ All the languages converging can make it feel like someone built a new LAX International\
  \ Terminal next to a bunch of volleyball courts. \n\nSince Disneyland purports to\
  \ be the \u201CHappiest Place on Earth\u201D you would think it was at least the\
  \ most popular tourist attraction in Southern California.  \u201CWrong(!)\u201D\
  \ as Donald J. Trump would say. Yep, the place where Weed Heads Rule is more popular\
  \ than The Magic Kingdom.  This little factoid is true because in Venice, you feel\
  \ hella free.  Routinely, you see people doing things that they probably wouldn\u2019\
  t be doing if they were walking down their hometown Main Street and doing things\
  \ they definitely couldn\u2019t get away with during Mickey\u2019s Main Street Parade.\
  \   I know  the whole American Freedom thing can be a little clich\xE9 but it feels\
  \ good to be able to do what the hell you feel like doing sometimes. In Venice,\
  \ that \u201Csometimes freedom\u201D seems like \u201Call the time freedom\u201D\
  . It\u2019s weird to pay a buck for shitty advice, but it\u2019s also weirdly empowering\u2014\
  especially as you look back at how things worked out when you took free advice from\
  \ people claiming to give good advice!\n\nIn its essence, this artist community\
  \ captures loyalty and devotion from its people with its depths and layers. This\
  \ beach has the most expensive properties in LA while accommodating a staggering\
  \ homeless population who travel from all over the country to have a free beach\
  \ front property without the hassle of the popos. Old heads who can\u2019t afford\
  \ the rising rent of this beat-up town leave only to come back every weekend to\
  \ dance, play, surf, skate and create alongside other idealists. \n\nI met a woman\
  \ in a coffee shop. While making small talk in line, she told me she just wanted\
  \ to grab coffee before heading over to the drum circle. I asked her, \u201CAre\
  \ you a local?\u201D\nShe said, \u201CI used to be, I moved to Orange County a couple\
  \ of years ago but I come back every weekend for the drum circle.\u201D \n\u201C\
  That\u2019s a long drive.\u201D\n\u201CIt\u2019s a habit. I have done it for years,\
  \ these people are my friends and family. The drive is worth it.\u201D"
