Text: "How hard it might be to fit in the new environment? The one that completely\
  \ differs from your inner kingdom, carefully build up and protected for your whole\
  \ life. The only solution to your anxiety is to toughen up and find your vibe of\
  \ an adventurer which you longed for but were always too scared to become. This\
  \ is a story of a regular russian girl wich has embarked on the adventure of her\
  \ life. \n\nWhat country comes to your mind when you think of an endless summer,\
  \ immense cultural heritage, paradise for your stomach and the \u201Cdolce vita\u201D\
  \ (sweet life)? Can\u2019t be that much of tough question and of course you have\
  \ guessed it right - the answer is Italy. Pizza, pasta, gelato, vino, Leonardo,\
  \ Dante, Fellini, Monica Bellucci etc etc... All this images kept racing round and\
  \ round in my head as I was flying on a plane from Moscow to Rome, then a short\
  \ flight to Puglia and I was there in the south region right on the bottom of so\
  \ called Italian boot. As I was getting off the plane the heat struck me bringing\
  \ the joy and letting me know that I was finally there. It was not just a tourist\
  \ visit, some of my classmate from university and I were there to explore the unknown.\
  \ We were there to undergo a training in the hotel and restaurant business, in other\
  \ words, we were cheap labourers for the Italian economy. Even though we knew about\
  \ our purpose there, I can swear, no one could imagine beforehand what this journey\
  \ prepared for us. \nFirst times are special and everything was new to me that day.\
  \ First I was standing in the group of mostly girls waiting near an airport to be\
  \ delivered to their place of work. It seemed like a regular tourist situation and\
  \ soon we would be sunbathing on the beach and partying all night long. But reality\
  \ was not as promising. \nNext stop was some small empty town, as many others in\
  \ the South Italy when it is not the tourist season. Boiling heat left no choice\
  \ but to find any kind of shadow while long anticipation was slowly strangling all\
  \ the romantic fantasies. \t\nWhen my new friend and I finally got to our new home\
  \ for the summer, what a surprise was the first thing to hear a russian speech at\
  \ the table full of silent italians. It was a good sign. \nWe were led through the\
  \ restaurant to our rooms in the basement. Sounds horrifying? That was what we felt\
  \ when the door closed and we were left alone in the room. The only window was the\
  \ ventilation grating. We felt ourselves disappointed but didn\u2019t want despair\
  \ yet. As it turned out later basement saved us from the unbearable summer heat,\
  \ let alone the fact that the owners family lived in the next room to ours. \nNext\
  \ step was to meet the boss which seemed a sweet man who made us our first italian\
  \ pasta. In Russia no one would understand how it is possible to eat pasta only\
  \ in the tomato sauce and cheese but Italians do it all the time and the name for\
  \ it is the Mediterranean diet.\nThat day finished with the most unsatisfying journey\
  \ to the nearest town as we walked by the highway to the city which offered us nothing\
  \ but a nervous breakdown. Obviously, the only way to travel there is by car so\
  \ don\u2019t make our mistake!\nThen there was two weeks of hell and misunderstandings,\
  \ hysterics and constant desire to leave that place which followed by the acceptance\
  \ and the new wave of infatuation with Italy. We worked hard but I can\u2019t say\
  \ that anybody around us did less work. At first we couldn\u2019t understand each\
  \ other but time did the trick. It was hard and devastating but I was treated like\
  \ a family. This was my last summer of the childhood which I would never trade for\
  \ something else and which left a piece of Italy in my heart for whole my life."
