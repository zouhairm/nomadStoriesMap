Text: "I always want to go back to Berlin: to its people, who have looks that you\
  \ can\u2019t seem to find anywhere else; to its Museum Insel, full of classic paintings\
  \ and classic architecture, where historical moments had happened; to its Museum\
  \ f\xFCr Gegenwart, with the Mao art from Warhol, and steel sheet sculptures from\
  \ Serra; to the architecture of the J\xFCdisches Museum, and its steel sheet masks\
  \ on the floor; to the sobriety of the Holocaust Monument\u2026 \nTiergarten, Brandenburger\
  \ Tor, Unter den Linden, Alexander Platz\u2026 \nThe first time I arrived in Berlin\
  \ it was the summer of 2013. I would be there for a couple of weeks and then go\
  \ to the centre of Germany, in the region Harz, to spend the three months of summer.\
  \  The region of region of Harz, with a very similar pronunciation and spelling\
  \ as \u201CHerz\u201D, in German, heart. \nMy favourite reference from Berlin is\
  \ C. Isherwood\u2019s novel, \u201CGoodbye to Berlin\u201D, the one of short stories,\
  \ the ones that Cabaret is based on. I find it to be a very interesting story in\
  \ a time shortly before WWII. I always envied C. Isherwood because he had lived\
  \ in Berlin at such an eclectic, enjoyable and interesting time, and probably just\
  \ before it all disappeared\u2026 I also envied him for having been in Tangier and\
  \ having lived California, around the time that Harvey Milk had passed away. \n\
  I was going to receive a German language lessons in the mornings, while I was in\
  \ Berlin, so that I would be a bit more prepared when disembark in the small village\
  \ of Clausthal, in the centre and the full depth of Germany. \nFor some days there\
  \ was a heat wave. It was one of those days, when I arrived. And there I was, with\
  \ my luggage full of clothes, and most of them not very summery, just in case it\
  \ got chilly. I sweated to get my luggage to the apartment. The apartment was quite\
  \ up in the city, in the neighbourhood bordering up with Pankow, a quite outskirt\
  \ neighbourhood of Berlin. \nMy language school had arranged for me to stay with\
  \ at some room in a girl\u2019s apartment, who was living in the city. My roommate\
  \ had majored in Literature and Theatre. The tenants of the building hanged their\
  \ laundry in the attic, right under the roof. There was a way to get up to the roof\
  \ and, that first night, we took a bottle of wine and to glasses and drank it to\
  \ the fading sun on the skylight of the city. \nImagine us there, on the roof, around\
  \ 9pm. Imagine the dirty buildings and a sky that starts to fade down as a lightened\
  \ background. If this were a movie, somebody would put a soft back tune to it...\n\
  I was a language student, instead of a teacher, but I liked to think of my situation\
  \ in Berlin as the one of the protagonist on C. Isherwood\u2019s novel, \u201CGoodbye\
  \ to Berlin\u201D, the one of short stories, the ones that Cabaret is based on.\
  \ But after that night, I didn\u2019t see much more of her around the apartment.\
  \ Who knows what Sally Bowles was busy with? \nBut my curiosity was more on the\
  \ line with the protagonist on C. Isherwood\u2019s novel. The first week was gone.\
  \ It was the end of June and it was the weekend of the pride parade in Berlin. \n\
  In Berlin, each Sunday, there is an open mic karaoke on Mauer Park. It sums up the\
  \ relaxed ambiance of the city. I went there with some new friends from my German\
  \ lessons. We took some seats in the small amphitheatre of the Park to see the show.\
  \ It was warm and we could grab a beer. We saw some Asians sing, a live (marriage)\
  \ proposal and some handsome bold guy, who came out by uncovering the message that\
  \ he was gay on his t-shirt\u2026\nBerlin was an awakening experience. In Berlin,\
  \ life is (really) a Cabaret. And the party never stops. \nSince then, I always\
  \ think of going back to Berlin for a last night of techno party and I wish that\
  \ it is never too late for it\u2026"
