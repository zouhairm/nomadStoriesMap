Text: 'We all plan to enjoy the journey in the hot summer season. In fact, with the
  start of the summer, the number of people traveling will be higher, and the beginning
  of the summer and the season will mean the start of summer vacation. But what can
  you do to have a journey full of joy and pleasure? The Eli Magazine Magazine introduces
  you a lot of fun on the journey, both calorie and fun activities. Joy and laughter,
  along with rest, should be the imperatives of every person''s life. We hope you''ll
  be more energetic with the rest of the trip and prepare yourself for the next trip.

  A trip with a recreational boat with a variety of facilities such as a swimming
  pool, a restaurant, water sports such as diving, sailing, etc. can be a new and
  exciting way of exploring. If you can make such trips, do not hesitate to enjoy
  it.

  A leisure trip can be a multi-hour picnic to the city park, or it can be a multi-day
  trip to another city or even a round-the-world tour. What distinguishes this type
  of travel from other travels is the traveler''s motive. On your excursion, you do
  not plan to visit ancient monuments or participate in an event, but you will go
  to enjoy places like parks and green spaces, zoos, mountains, caves, jungle, sea,
  al-Khah.'
