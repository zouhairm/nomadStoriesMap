Text: "Travelling abroad for nine months is something that you have to think quite\
  \ seriously before doing it. But I didn\u2019t. I just took my plane and let all\
  \ the culture and experiences that I lived in this white country to change my life.\
  \ I crossed a forest in the middle of the night looking for Northern lights, I drank\
  \ a cup of coffee with a finnish grandma who was even more adorable than all the\
  \ Santa Claus village that I visited when I went to Lapland, I cried when I saw\
  \ for the first time in a cold dark night this colorful lights falling down from\
  \ the sky. I had to walk to my school with almost a meter of snow covering the street,\
  \ I swam in a frozen lake and drink beer in a sauna and, even after that, I can\u2019\
  t say that hot beer is something drinkable. But I didn\u2019t expected that with\
  \ this experience I was going to learn how to travel. Maybe you still don\u2019\
  t know how, but the best way of travelling is living. Living every village, tasting\
  \ every food, talking with every person you meet in your journey, because in this\
  \ people is where the esence of every country is."
