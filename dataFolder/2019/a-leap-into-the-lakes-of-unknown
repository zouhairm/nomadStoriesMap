  \ \u2013 checked\nExcitement and determination to leap into the unknown \u2013 checked\n\
  \nSo, suitcase is packed and I am ready to take off on my most spontaneous journey\
  \ towards MEUZ - Model European Union in Zagreb (Croatia).\n\nI always wanted to\
  \ participate in a simulation of the European Union institutions while being a student\
  \ but I could never really afford it until I graduated university and started earning\
  \ money spending my time, determination and passion for living in an office job.\n\
  \n\u201CStory of my life\u201D you\u2019ll say \u201CReality and dreams never really\
  \ match\u201D. And this is why you can imagine the mixture of enthusiasm, satisfaction\
  \ and curiosity with a pinch of adventurous spirit that was pleasing my senses ever\
  \ since I received the acceptance e-mail for the conference. \n\nZagreb \u2013 here\
  \ I come. MEUZ \u2013 here I come. Into the unknown.\n\nAll conference delegates\
  \ were accommodated in a hostel in the very center of Zagreb, Croatia\u2019s capital:\n\
  I was two-minute walk away from the main city square Ban Jela\u010Di\u0107 (best\
  \ place for rendezvous), from the Downtown Pedestrian zone where your everyday needs\
  \ can be fulfilled and just on the edge of the old city Gradec. \n\nGradec is built\
  \ on the hill Gri\u010D. It amuses not only with the St. Mark\u2019s Church whose\
  \ red and white roof tiles are laid so that they represent the coat of arms of Zagreb\
  \ but with narrow  sheer streets and stairs between the buildings which magically\
  \ transfer you to a lower or higher part of the hill. There awaits you the \u201C\
  Suvenirnica\u201D (souvenir shop), \u201Cki\u0161obrani\u201D (typical Croatia umbrellas),\
  \ the restaurant with the so-longed \"ra\u017Enji\u0107i\" (meat on skewers) or\
  \ a breath-taking panorama view of the city. \n\nEvery evening after the MEUZ conference\
  \ meetings full of intense debates, exhausting role playing and tricky games a.k.a.\
  \ House of Cards one could finally relax from the tension and recharge enjoying\
  \ the very spirit of the city.\n\nDespite this parade of colourful experiences for\
  \ the senses, each morning I had this tickling feeling that the best is yet to come.\
  \ The trigger for this was a poster in the hostel picturing a rhapsody of turquoise\
  \ blue lakes and crystal clear waterfalls. It was labeled Plitvi\u010Dka jezera\
  \ (Plitvica Lakes). \n\nKnowing that the whole day is off on the departure date\
  \ I embarked on a mission to recruit companions for the trip organized by the hostel\
  \ and promoted on the poster. All conference delegates admitted the uniqueness of\
  \ the opportunity and how they\u2019ll join but on the last night the receptionist\
  \ informed me that actually no one signed up. I again tried to talk people into\
  \ it but my dreams were shattered - only Anya and me had the need of this picturesque,\
  \ water\u2013full adventure in the nature as a closure to our Zagreb adventure.\n\
  \nLuckily, the receptionist encouraged us that actually the lakes were only two\
  \ hours away from Zagreb and there was direct transport from the Zagreb Bus Station\
  \ each day starting 7:30 am, so we actually had time to go there, hike and return\
  \ on time to catch our transport back home. \n\nOn the next morning the tram was\
  \ moving so slowly that I had knots of anxiety in my stomach because Anya and me\
  \ might never make it to the Bus Station on time. We arrived 7:25 am and entered\
  \ the hall hastily looking for schedule or desk to buy tickets. What a nutcracker\
  \ \u2013 no one could speak English, personnel were only pointing the platforms\
  \ when they hear Plitvi\u010Dka jezera.  \n\nWe rushed among the buses \u2013 there\
  \ was no time to reconsider our plan or give up. On the edge of panic, heavily breathing\
  \ and bodies still not fully awaken to endure this morning run we found the bus\
  \ for Plitvica just when its tiny, slim, blonde female driver was about to close\
  \ the doors and depart. We were so shocked at this example of female emancipation\
  \ that we totally forgot to ask about tickets. Instead, we readily got on following\
  \ her welcoming gesture.\n\nThis is how I leaped into the lakes of unknown and unexpected\
  \ natural beauty of Plitvica which I\u2019ll introduce you next time. Get ready\
  \ to feel the temptation."
