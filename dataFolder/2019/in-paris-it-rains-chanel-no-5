Text: "I suppose it is fitting that I write this article on a plane\u2014\_even more\
  \ so that I had to sprint from ticketing to the gate to make this flight when my\
  \ first was canceled. Throughout college, I took five study abroad courses and every\
  \ time something took a turn for the worse or \u2014\_depending on how you choose\
  \ to look at things \u2014 for the better. While some may prefer pristine, meticulously-organized\
  \ travels, I\u2019ve found there is greater joy in embracing experiences over itinerary.\
  \ As a natural planner, learning to be comfortable in the unknown was difficult.\
  \ As a writer, however, I\u2019ve found unexpected adventures to be worth every\
  \ cold, sleepless, crazy second. \n\nThe first time I traveled abroad, Paris, a\
  \ city I had long dreamed of, greeted me with traffic and noise. After traveling\
  \ from London via the \u201Cchunnel\u201D (the train tunnel that passes under the\
  \ English Channel), I was yet determined to see all I could of the City of Lights\
  \ in only two days. The first order of business, of course, was food. A Euro coin\
  \ is about the size of a quarter, so feeling as if I were merely purchasing gum\
  \ balls, I unwittingly spent a fortune on macarons, which were, naturally, accompanied\
  \ by bread. It seems the French diet consists primarily of carbohydrates; while\
  \ a full British breakfast consists of more types of sausages than I knew existed,\
  \ the French spread was comprised of bread with a side of fruit layered on bread\
  \ with more bread and strong coffee with bread and a croissant for good measure.\
  \ \n\nParis was paradise for this carb-loving runner and it\u2019s no wonder that\
  \ the French rely so heavily on bread as Paris is an incredibly active city. After\
  \ another baguette (this time with melted Brie and a spicy sausage\u2026Who knew\
  \ the best hot dog I\u2019d ever have would be in Paris?), I decided it was high\
  \ time I joined ranks with the city\u2019s legions of bicyclists. Besides, doesn\u2019\
  t pedaling peacefully along the Seine sound like a lovely picture? I imagined the\
  \ experience would be like a scene from one of the paintings or books sold in little\
  \ carts along the river. As with any seemingly-perfect picture, though, it was too\
  \ good to be true. Still, that evening was wonderful and became foundational to\
  \ my travel philosophy. \n\nFaster than walking, but more personal than buses, bike\
  \ tours are undoubtably my favorite way to sight-see. The guide passed out the company\u2019\
  s signature blue bikes (by Blue Fox Travel), along with helmets and \u2013\_to my\
  \ dismay \u2013\_ponchos. I could not conceal my disappointment: wasn\u2019t Paris\
  \ the city of fashion? I didn\u2019t want to ride about soggy and shapeless with\
  \ helmet hair, but as soon as the drizzle started, I was grateful for my new look.\
  \ What nobody ever seems to mention is that Paris can be as dank and damp as London\
  \ and, unlike the Los Angeles drivers I am used to, traffic does not slow at all\
  \ due to poor weather. The ride started out nice enough (despite my almost crashing\
  \ into the Seine when a passerby smiled at me) and, upon dismounting at the Eiffel\
  \ Tower, we were still warm enough to enjoy a scoop of gelato at its base. \n\n\
  Then, the rain struck. With two hours left to the tour, we pressed on, passing iconic\
  \ landmarks and navigating what the guide told us is \u201Cthe most dangerous roundabout\
  \ in Paris,\u201D before pausing in the silent courtyard of the Louvre. In the glow\
  \ of its glass pyramids, the rain sparkled like diamonds and I all at once saw that\
  \ the beauty of this city did not lie in its sunshine and flowers alone, but \u2014\
  \_like a stylish woman \u2014\_also its darker temperaments. Shivering but beaming\
  \ with delight, I turned circles on my bike in pure, imperfect bliss. \n\nThroughout\
  \ that trip and all of my adventures since, I often recalled the humorous but wise\
  \ words of the tour guide: \u201CDo not worry; in Paris, it rains Chanel No. 5.\u201D\
  \ It was far from the Parisian summer evening I\u2019d imagined, but turned out\
  \ to be a night that I would never forget, teaching me to embrace and enjoy the\
  \ unexpected."
