Text: "The Youth exchange Carpathia.lab brought 32 participants from different countries\
  \ (Ukraine, Germany, Greece, Georgia, Russia and Poland). Program was organized\
  \ by Logos NGO and Gr\xFCner Grashalm e.V.\nTogether we had to explore the beauty,\
  \ diversity and fragility of the Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains and to engage with\
  \ the human impact on environment over a period of 14 days at the end of June. These\
  \ days were full of adventures, most of them never imagined. Started with sun, continued\
  \ with rain and in the middle there was a snow. Can you imagine? \nWe had our practical\
  \ and psychological preparation works in Ivano-Frankivsk, one of the Precarpathian\
  \ cities. Then we started to hike to Hoverla - the highest point of Ukraine (2061m).\
  \ First day was nice and sunny, we even needed sunscreen. That was the only time\
  \ we had a chance to use it. Then there was endless rain. \nWe also had solar batteries\
  \ that was charged only 7%, during whole trip. \u201CRain starts, hiking starts\u201D\
  \ became our informal motto. The rain couldn\u2019t stop us. We reach the Hoverla,\
  \ where we enjoyed fantastic view, took photos and congratulated each other. Then\
  \ someone said that the most difficult part was behind us.\nNo one knew what was\
  \ waiting for us at the lake Nesamovyte (1750m). There we had to arrange camp for\
  \ one night. But In the morning everything was white, because there was a snow.\
  \ The temperature was -3C. We needed time to analyze. Only after that, People who\
  \ had dried clothes left started to act. Even fish soup we tasted. They were real\
  \ heroes, they arranged delivery work to tents. We had to stay one more night there.\
  \ Everything was wet already. We didn\u2019t have any more gas to cook. And on the\
  \ right time we took our tents and went down.\nThen there was the very nice camping\
  \ place named White Elephant, where we could sleep in real beds, take a shower and\
  \ even the sauna. After pleasant night we went for rafting and kayaking. That was\
  \ amazing.\nAfter that we went to Pip-Ivan \u2013 the third highest mountain (2022),\
  \ where astronomical and meteorological observatory is located. That trip would\
  \ be incredible without rain of course.  \nDuring our trip we were buying foods\
  \ from locals. What they could to sell, different types of cheese, fresh milk, canned\
  \ vegetables and jams. We were managing trash. We were collecting others\u2019 trash\
  \ with ours. We buried bio trash and separated other trash. When we went to White\
  \ Elephant we put them in separated trash bins.\nThen we visited Didova Hatchyna,\
  \ it was like a hostel in mountains. There we tasted local tea, found different\
  \ musical instruments, played on them, while barbeque was preparing. And of course\
  \ we enjoyed the rain.\nThen we hiked to Hata Maysternya, where we met group of\
  \ kids, who was staying here at camp. We made workshop and entertaining activities\
  \ for them. All of us enjoyed it. \nFinally we came back to our hotel in Ivano-Frankivsk,\
  \ where we had final evaluation and bye-bye party. We found that we were become\
  \ very closer after we left that place. So that farewell was very difficult."
