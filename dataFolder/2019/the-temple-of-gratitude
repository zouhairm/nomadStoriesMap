Text: "We were climbing up that hill for hours now. None of us expected that it would\
  \ take that long to reach the temple.  \nEscalating a steep hill in the Japanese\
  \ summer proved itself as quite the challenge. In the humid 50\xB4c, breathing fumes\
  \ of condensate water, the air weighted in our lungs, increasing our breath frequency,\
  \ generating even more heat. At this point most of our belongings were abandoned\
  \ along the trail, which proved itself arduous by the minute, however, giving up\
  \ was not an option, that physically demanding pathway represented a different struggle.\n\
  I was living in Japan for almost 3 months back then and earlier that week I became\
  \ aware of my grandfather\xB4s cancer, at the time he was 83 years old. He told\
  \ me about a small tumor in the first portion of his stomach and explained how he\
  \ was advised not to operate on it in virtue of his age and the slow growing nature\
  \ of the appointed lesion. We talked for hours that day and I reminded him that\
  \ he was a survivor who lived through famine and poverty, recidivating prostate\
  \ cancer, large bowel removal, and so many other health endeavors. He was healthy\
  \ and strong, unwilling to die anytime soon, for him he was 83 years young. We deliberated\
  \ that if the surgery wasn\xB4t performed now, by the time he was 93 it would\xB4\
  ve been inoperable, and he agreed to take on the greatest challenge of his life\
  \ so far.\nThere we were, in the beautiful Nanzoin area in Fukuoka, in the island\
  \ of Kyushu, at the Japanese \u201Cday of the dead\u201D, accompanying friends who\
  \ were celebrating the lives of their forefathers, when we passed by a sign next\
  \ to these forested hills, away from everything else, scripted as \u201Cstrength\
  \ entity\u201D. In the Xintoist religion it is believed that each temple belongs\
  \ to an entity, linked to a meaning that you seek through a prayer. We decided to\
  \ follow the trail in order to make a prayer for my grandfather. None of us expected\
  \ to find such burdensome terrain. The intense hike proved itself challenging and\
  \ after long hours we reached a small building by the side of a road, with a different\
  \ sign from before; there we wondered around, found a water spout to refresh ourselves\
  \ from our sweat dripping clothes and stood in silence, wondering of our whereabouts.\
  \ I took a deep breath and raised my head, stretching out my neck far and wide,\
  \ attempting to cool myself off and relax my muscles, when I gazed up high on a\
  \ peak, beyond hundreds of stairs, the temple.\nWe gasped in a mix of distress and\
  \ anticipation, twisted the sweat from our clothes and moved up the staircase. Each\
  \ flight of stairs slowly caved under our shaking limbs, the water had already evaporated\
  \ and now we were only sweat and dirt. At last, there we were, exasperated, fatigued,\
  \ overall betrayed by the unexpected hardship of the plunging trail. We looked around\
  \ through the tiny and plain wooden temple, coy bestowed the mountains and other\
  \ residential buildings. I lit up a candle and three incenses, woken up the entity\
  \ by clapping my hands, took a bow while holding my hands together and sang a prayer\
  \ asking for: strength to face the upcoming journey, hope to reach a cure, and mostly\
  \ gratitude for the mission which presented itself as an early stage disease. I\
  \ left moving backwards, with my body flushing in sweat, dirt and tears.\nThat day\
  \ we experienced a rough and rather disappointing trail, carrying only hope in our\
  \ pockets, however It wasn\xB4t about the temple after all. That extenuating journey\
  \ somehow represented the quest my grandfather was about to embark on. Essentially,\
  \ if he was willing to challenge himself, then so was I, and so I did."
