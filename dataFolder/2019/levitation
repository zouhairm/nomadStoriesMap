Text: "They told me not to go to Zhangjiajie\u2019s National Forest Park alone, but\
  \ I wasn\u2019t afraid of being lost. I mean, isn\u2019t \u201Clost\u201D what brought\
  \ me to China in the first place? \nI lost my way in the trees. I felt dizzy, dehydrated\
  \ and, well, lost. I revisited an old habit I thought I had left for good back in\
  \ Egypt, putting my headphones on and distracting myself from my problems. I had\
  \ recently started discovering Beethoven\u2019s symphonies and still couldn\u2019\
  t tell his ninth from his fifth so I randomly played the fifth and sat down to catch\
  \ my breath. I looked down from the mountain and saw people coming and going and\
  \ thought about my two journeys: the one that started two months ago in Beijing\
  \ and was coming to an end and the other that started twenty one years ago in my\
  \ mother\u2019s womb and showed no signs of ending yet.\nI thought about the luggage\
  \ that tormented me since my plane landed and how laborious it was to carry that\
  \ much weight on my shoulders alongside the much heavier weight beating inside my\
  \ chest. In that moment, I felt a balance I haven\u2019t felt in years and never\
  \ even considered the possibility of finding it again. Balance between the weight\
  \ I have been carrying for too long and the distance I went so that weight becomes\
  \ weightless and I can feel this lightness again. 6896 kilometres to be exact.\n\
  It was more than just balance, what I felt was equilibrium, between me and the universe.\
  \ We both were moving in the same direction. We both were infinite.\n\u201COne thought\
  \ at a time\u201D they always said and I\u2019ve never been able to do that. How\
  \ can someone possibly control a tsunami tide of thoughts hitting them without warning?\
  \ Because that has always been my case, but on that mountain it was somehow possible.\
  \ I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the height that made it possible and made the world\
  \ slow down, the haunting beauty of the trees or the momentary feeling that there\u2019\
  s no such thing as surrealism and Salvador Dali never touched a brush before. The\
  \ world seemed reasonable, tranquil and perfectly symmetrical around me.\nThe one\
  \ thought at that moment of solace was eternity. I think about eternity almost all\
  \ the time but I never really got my head around the concept until then. I just\
  \ wanted it, I wanted to stretch that moment throughout time and space until there\u2019\
  s nothing else. Just me, the trees, the mountains and Beethoven\u2019s fifth symphony\
  \ echoing in the back of my dizzy light head."
