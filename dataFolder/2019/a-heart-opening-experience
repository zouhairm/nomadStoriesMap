Text: "Crystal clear water, lazing on beaches and turtle conservation is what I expected\
  \ over the next one and a half months during my volunteer experience on Moso Island,\
  \ Vanuatu. \n\nI was living in a hut with a bucket flush toilet and shower, fresh\
  \ food was made for me by the local women which I ate with the other volunteer members\
  \ and men of the community. \n\nI got to meet Susan, one of the women cooking for\
  \ us.  We exchanged stories of our homes, our families and the food we had or hadn\u2019\
  t eaten. My next weekly trip into Port Villa I found a kiwi fruit to bring back\
  \ to Susan (Being a kiwi myself I had to let her try it!) \n\nWhat I got in return\
  \ was far more than I expected, she cried with joy from my gift and  invited me\
  \ into her home, treating me like a daughter for the rest of my trip. She taught\
  \ me how to plant taro, fertilise the gardens with fire, fish like a local and even\
  \ let me help in the birth of her puppies.\n\nShe opened her heart and home to me\
  \ from my small gesture, when she herself was living in a tin hut with 4 children.\
  \ I was totally humbled by this experience and will never look at a kiwi fruit the\
  \ same way again. \n\nIt\u2019s true what they say, the people of Vanuatu are the\
  \ happiest and most giving people on earth. Thanks to Susan I left that country\
  \ with a smile from ear to ear that with last the rest of my life."
