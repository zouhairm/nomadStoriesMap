Text: "I thought I knew a lot about it. I thought I knew what to expect. I thought\
  \ that it would change my way of seeing things\u2026 but not by much. I guess I\
  \ was wrong. The Way to Santiago de Compostela took me by surprise. How can one\
  \ be prepared for an experience that is based on unexpected moments and personal\
  \ growth?\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect. The\
  \ day we started walking I thought that I would feel scared. And I did! Scared of\
  \ not being able to complete the 447km from Coca, Segovia. Scared of getting lost.\
  \ Scared of getting blisters or becoming injured. Scared of not enjoying the pilgrimage\
  \ as one should. Scared of not being religious enough. And most of all, scared of\
  \ not finding what one is supposed to look for in the Way. Luckily, I was more excited\
  \ than scared, an excitement filled with anticipation such as I have never felt\
  \ before. \n\nHowever, I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting to become addicted to walking\
  \ 25km per day carrying a 6kg backpack that, every time I put it on, made me feel\
  \ like I was sinking. Walking every day for 26 days in a row, being sweaty, sore\
  \ and tired every single day was the most difficult thing I have ever had to do.\
  \ Where did I find the energy to climb that steep hill after a long day of hiking?\
  \ How did I manage to walk those extra 6 km late in the evening after we had taken\
  \ a wrong turn? How was I able to finish one long stage in the pouring rain with\
  \ all my clothes wet and my fingers freezing? What a feeling of accomplishment and\
  \ pride I felt for having overcome numerous difficulties and obstacles.\n\nNor was\
  \ I expecting to find such charm in some of the smallest villages of Spain: a Romanesque\
  \ church cheek-by-jowl with a medieval castle across the road from a bar with three\
  \ old fellows chatting in the doorway. So many friendly gestures took me by surprise:\
  \ a middle-aged woman gave us a package of peanuts \u2013 how that cheered us up;\
  \ the bar tender that one cold morning enjoyed our loud Beatle song and gave us\
  \ an Orujo shot; a bent old man walked with us to the right path late one afternoon\
  \ when we were totally lost. It gave me faith in humanity and made me want to spread\
  \ that kindness further. And the scenery. The scenery moved my soul: wheat fields\
  \ being blown by the afternoon wind like waves in the ocean with poppies surfing\
  \ along the crest- a real-life Monet painting; the dense morning mist on the top\
  \ of a mountain; the crystal clear water rivers that made our feet scream for getting\
  \ soaked.\n\nAnother surprise was how quickly I connected with other pilgrims. We\
  \ talked about everything and nothing, about past, present and future. We shared\
  \ the silence of nature. It sometimes seemed like we had known each other for years.\
  \ \n\nAnd if what one experiences during the long pilgrimage is hard to predict,\
  \ the diverse emotions upon arriving at long last in Santiago de Compostela are\
  \ indescribable. How odd that finally accomplishing a feat that one has been dreaming\
  \ of for so long should be so bittersweet. Arriving at the Cathedral of Santiago\
  \ makes one long for the journey just completed. Surrounded by the pilgrims that\
  \ had become my friends and family during the last few weeks, we hugged and cried,\
  \ amazed at our strange mix of emotions, emotions that can only be understood after\
  \ having walked the Way. \n\nI learned that one can be happy and sad at the same\
  \ time. I learned how to say goodbye to people that had meant so much to me. I learned\
  \ that one can be happy with such few things \u2013 all that can fit into a knapsack.\
  \ That is the magic of the Camino, a magic that has been working on pilgrims for\
  \ the last twelve centuries."
