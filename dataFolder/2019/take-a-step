Text: "I was sitting beside my bedroom window with the light on and my thoughts tucked\
  \ away in my own grasp. \n\nWhat was it about travelling on my own that gave me\
  \ a thrilling fear and a fierce desire to conquer the world both at the same time?\
  \ \n\nI found myself staring at world maps, or flicking through travel brochures,\
  \ with a keen glow of expectation in me that maybe soon i would go on a adventure.\n\
  \nEven if the anxiety sometimes tried to pull me down, i would smack it in the face\
  \ and keep moving forward no matter what! \n\n\"It is time to venture out of your\
  \ comfort zone\"..I told myself ..as i rallyed up the courage within me to simply\
  \ book a flight intersate. \n\nIt was to experience new sounds, new people, new\
  \ tastes, new smells, new places ....that drew me to the plane..and beyond..I smiled\
  \ at what was up ahead as if i could see what was coming..i didn't really know though,\
  \ and it was the unknown that gave me a flicker of great excitement..washing over\
  \ my nerves and helping me to see that i didn't have to know, to fly. \nI passed\
  \ my plane ticket to the flight attendant for her to scan and slipped through the\
  \ crowds of people smiling, laughing and talking. \n\nI could sit on a plane and\
  \ gaze out of the windows at the sky, listening to my favourite playlist and imagining\
  \ what the future holds ....for hours. \n\nBut soon enough we landed on Sydney soil\
  \ and my thoughts were interupted by the present moment. \n\nI am here! \nBreathe!\
  \ Smell! Look! Touch! Listen! Taste! \n\nI stepped off the plane with an airy step\
  \ as i looked around me, at a huge airport that smelled like what a city should\
  \ smell like. \n\nA mingle of people, food and tall buildings that seemed to reach\
  \ as high as the plane i had been sitting in for one hour and a half. \n\nIt was\
  \ an overwhelming sense of wonder, being a small part of the new. \n\nI would walk\
  \ from train station to train station, sit on buses and wander into corner cafes.\
  \ \n\nI would sit and eat a salad roll and sip on a cool juice while i listened\
  \ to the hum and buzz of busy....busy people, busy places, busy yet desiring a chat\
  \ to escape the mundane sometimes..maybe just a simple..\"hello, how are you?\"\
  \ and a listening ear. \n\nI was here in Sydney to attend a Hillsong conference\
  \ and i was anticipating crazy, crazy is good..in moderation. \n\nBut you can never\
  \ have enough adventure and good spirited laughs and friendships that you make along\
  \ the way! \n\nI jumped, and sang, and listened, and looked on, and touched anothers\
  \ hand as we prayed and worshipped in that conference. \n\nI was inspired, i was\
  \ challenged, and i was reflective on my creative journey so far. \n\nIt truly was\
  \ an ascent. \nA pilgrimage to the unknown, every day of our lives. \n\nNothing\
  \ could stop me from living my best life, except me. \n\nI smiled at myself as i\
  \ walked off back home after another 1 hour and a half flight and tucked myself\
  \ under the covers, turning off the light. \n\nHere i was now, but the question\
  \ was how long can i stay here? \n\nMy blood was already tingling with anticipation\
  \ of a new adventure, and it flowed in my veins like a surge of excitement, amongst\
  \ the mountains of fear that had finally crumbled down around me .....like walls\
  \ that never truly existed, except in my imagination. \n\n\"I will travel more often\"\
  , i whispered under my breath, as i told my heart once again! ..Breathe! Look! Listen!\
  \ Smell! Taste! Touch! \n\nI knew that finally it was time to let go and let myself\
  \ experience life like it was meant to be, unbridled and free. \n\nTo hear the peoples\
  \ stories, to share them..with them. .\n\nTo wander through every corner and crevice\
  \ of sights and sounds and listen for the music in the footsteps of those who went\
  \ before me. \n\nThat is traveling to me."
