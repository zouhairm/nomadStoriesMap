Text: "Finally we left, we stopped at the fuel station, the pump attendant was a young\
  \ girl with tacky and overemphasized makeup and a look in her eyes that screamed\
  \ \u201Cpick me\u201D.  A dark guy that spoke the same language as him joined us.\
  \ I greeted him when he got behind the steering, he answered with the air of someone\
  \ who didn\u2019t know (and didn\u2019t expect) he had company until the company\
  \ stirred. We left and made another stop at a tiny chemist. He went in to get what\
  \ he later dissolved in water and took when we got to Abuja for his stomach. He\
  \ walked with a certain gait. His jeans looked a little flayed. he came out and\
  \ we continued to Abuja. \n\nHis name was Hamza Raheem. He was at that age at which\
  \ if one were still a fool, would be a fool forever. He was a Major in the army\
  \ even though he seemed too soft, his eyes were wicked. \n\nWe got stopped for checks\
  \ by both soldiers and policemen to whom Hamza always threw back his head in a self\
  \ contented manner to say \u201CMajor Raheem\u201D, always after they had asked\
  \ for the back seat window where I was seated to be rolled down, because the glasses\
  \ were tinted. The first soldier gave a swift salute and a smile and waved us through\
  \ without asking for an ID. But the second soldier asked for an ID and gave the\
  \ most sexiest salute I\u2019d ever seen after looking at it. \nHe straightened\
  \ his spine, stiffened his right hand that was curved in the right angles, then\
  \ edgily and at the same time swiftly moved it to his forehead and down with this\
  \ fluidity that I can only associate with water. \nWe even met a policeman that\
  \ exchanged banters with the dark guy that drove because he didn\u2019t hear \u201C\
  Major Raheem\u201D when he was supposed to and that led to repetitions.\n I watched\
  \ on while we rode, I couldn\u2019t sleep, maybe because I was too conscious of\
  \ myself or I felt Hamza was watching me from the side mirror (which I later checked\
  \ on the ride back but couldn\u2019t see anything from there) or the journey was\
  \ just too short to allow a good sleep. Even after Hamza slept off, I couldn\u2019\
