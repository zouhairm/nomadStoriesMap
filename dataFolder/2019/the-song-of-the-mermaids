Text: "Have you ever heard the song of the mermaids? A melody that invites you to\
  \ the unknown and seduces you to dance towards the edge of a cliff where your absolute\
  \ freedom awaits.\nSitting in my cramped desk looking absentminded to the monitor\
  \ of my computer, I have heard million of times that melody, but it\xB4s constantly\
  \ interrupted by almost anything. Today the interruption was a girl that I work\
  \ with asking me if I wanted coffee. I haven\xB4t drunk coffee since I started working\
  \ here, a year ago, and she still asks me everyday the same question. There are\
  \ some social behaviours that I simply don\xB4t understand. \n\nI arrived home crying\
  \ a little bit, feeling empty inside, wondering: what am I doing in a job like that?\
  \ My dreams were so big once and this town is so small. The melody became so loud\
  \ at this point that I couldn\xB4t t escape anymore. My feet start jumping. I am\
  \ dancing towards the cliff. I am moving to London.\n\nI would never be able to\
  \ erase the goodbye at the airport: my mother with tears in her eyes, my father\
  \ with a fake smile and the expression of respect on my brother\u2019s face. I have\
  \ never been far away from home. Mexican families are meant to be together ALWAYS\
  \ but I needed to find out who I was without them. I think that is why we travel.\
  \ To discover what we are in a new place away from everything we know. It is as\
  \ we are looking for little pieces of our soul that are hidden around the world.\
  \ We travel looking for new experiences and people that help us find the way towards\
  \ a better version of ourselves.\n\nI arrived with all the excitement in the world\
  \ to City Airport in London. My excitement decreased a little bit when I had to\
  \ carry my huge suitcase around the tube, so many stairs. I needed to make my way\
  \ to Bank Station to meet a friend that was letting me sleep on her couch until\
  \ I managed to find a job, no pressure.\n\nI remember that night talking to my friend\
  \ in a Pub (new exotic place for me), feeling completely terrified and excited at\
  \ the same time. What if I can\xB4t make it and I have to go back home without finding\
  \ what I want? Where to start looking for something that you don\xB4t even know\
  \ what it is?\n\nThe beginning of my adventure wasn\xB4t easy. I was running out\
  \ of money and I couldn\xB4t find a job. I was about to give up. Every day felt\
  \ so long and defeating that I just wanted to run back home to my family. I asked\
  \ my friend what she thought: should I stay or should I go? Her answer was short,\
  \ harsh and wise. She said: this might be one in a life time opportunity, you have\
  \ no kids, no husband, no precious job back home. Stop whining, find a job and start\
  \ living and adult life away from Mama and Papa.\n\nWhat was supposed to be 6 months\
  \ in London became 2 years. \n\nLondon taught me what a real change of season looked\
  \ like, words like biscuit, hoover, tube and courgette. Also, how to be politely\
  \ rude and that the weather has the power of changing everyone\u2019s mood. A ray\
  \ of sun is an event to be celebrated by putting on a swimsuit and run to the nearest\
  \ park to sunbathe even though it\xB4s still cold and in an hour it might rain.\
  \ \n\nLondon was a change of skin, a punch of reality, a bittersweet experience.\
  \ I found friends that became family and places that became home. Saying goodbye\
  \ was difficult but after two years I felt it was time to go back to Mexico.\n\n\
  My family was expecting me eagerly but they were expecting someone who didn\xB4\
  t exist anymore. I really wanted to see them again but after a taste of what was\
  \ to be able to survive in a new place against all odds, I was sure my return to\
  \ Mexico was just a brief stop before a new adventure. And I was right."
