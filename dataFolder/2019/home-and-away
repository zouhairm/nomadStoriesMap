Text: "I never expected to find such familiarity in a place so very far away. Australia.\
  \ The land of blistering heat, kangaroos and didgeridoos. Being from Canada, this\
  \ was a very foreign concept to me. I didn\u2019t expect the familiarity I would\
  \ feel walking through their grocery stores, strolling through their neighbourhoods\
  \ or even visiting their zoos. And yet, in that familiarity, I was also struck by\
  \ how unknown it was to me. \n\n\tWhen we first arrived in Brisbane, Australia,\
  \ my mother and I were struck by how familiar and yet alien it all felt. We felt\
  \ completely at home waiting for our baggage to arrive from the carousel. And yet\
  \ we were lost when told that our car could be found in the \u201Ccar park\u201D\
  . When asked \u201Chow you going\u201D we stared blankly, but we could easily adapt\
  \ our knowledge of American football to their rules for \u201Cfooty\u201D. The neighbourhood\
  \ we stayed in was exactly what you would expect from an upper-class neighbourhood\
  \ in California\u2026 minus the enormous spiders of course. \n\n\tThe food in Australia\
  \ provided nothing much different from what we could find back at home. But something\
  \ gave it a different quality. Perhaps it was the companionship that came with relaxing\
  \ and sharing a meal with friends and family. While very similar in the style and\
  \ flavours, Australian cooking seems to almost demand that you take time to sit\
  \ and enjoy your meal with your family. This is something many of us miss out on\
  \ in our day-to-day lives, so it was nice to just take that time with family. \n\
  \n\tThe zoos were all organized the same. You could have been walking through any\
  \ old zoo in Canada or the states. For me, that feeling wore off when we saw the\
  \ first crocodile. He was sitting at the bottom of his pool in the middle of his\
  \ open-air enclosure. It was something I had never seen before. This incredible,\
  \ deadly beast so up close and personal. At any zoo in Canada, you would be separated\
  \ by any animal posing even the most minimal threat by a foot of glass. \n\n\n\t\
  I never thought I would feel such familiarity in a place so far from my home. And\
  \ yet, with that familiarity came a never-ending sense of wonderment with all the\
  \ strange things I encountered."
