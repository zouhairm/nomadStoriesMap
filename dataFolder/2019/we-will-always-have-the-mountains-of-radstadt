Text: "Three years had past since the night we didn't said goodbye. He left abruptly\
  \ after I looked at him with a compassionate smile making him understand it wasn't\
  \ going to happen...  That was the moment I mislead him to believe everything between\
  \ us had been all in his head. \n\nThe untold truth is that I wanted to go back\
  \ to the Salzbourg mountain house and chat in the balancin, and stay there indefinitely.\
  \ \n\nOne thousand one hundred days had passed since we all had gone back to our\
  \ lives and countries: Austria, Spain, Greece and Hungary. \n\nAll began when a\
  \ friend asked me if I wanted to travel to Austria for an european project, all\
  \ expenses paid.  Why not? I was ready to take a leap into the unknown. \n\nSo a\
  \ week later off we went, when we arrived to Vienna and were welcomed by the rest\
  \ of the group I was amazed as so many nationalities and backgrounds I cannot explain\
  \ how heterogeneous we were. \n\nOn the next day we took a train, and went to stay\
  \ for a week at a beautiful house in the town of Radstadt in Salzburg. At the last\
  \ house of the last road at a very snowy time of the year. the mountain view was\
  \ breathtaking.\n\nIt was beautiful experience but also difficult, spending that\
  \ much time with the same people can get tricky, specially if there are different\
  \ ideologies. We had some really tense moments regarding delicate political subjects.\
  \ \n\nIt was in the middle of one those arguments, when I decided to take some time\
  \ off and went to my favourite place: the kitchen. There I ran into R who was cooking,\
  \ and he was the first person who actually asked me my thoughts on the matter. I\
  \ found him easy to talk to, and we bonded naturally. \n\nThen the days went by\
  \ and I kept enjoying getting to know the rest of the group, playing in the snow,\
  \ late night dissertations and I met one local girl who invited me to her farm to\
  \ cook with her mother who taught me how to make Hasen\xF6hrl mit Sauerkraut, (pastry\
  \ triangles). In the middle of all I would sometimes ran into R and had a long chat\
  \ like old friends do. \n\nAll felt normal, until the day me and him were looking\
  \ at the mountains sitting at the balancing. Suddenly I stopped feeling the cold\
  \ in my face and instinctively looked at his lips, I then realised I had completely\
  \ lost track of time. \n \nWhen I finally went back to my room I felt that little\
  \ pinch one feels in the chest once you know.  And then I also felt another pinch\
  \ as I knew I wouldn't...my boyfriend was waiting for me at home. \n\nOn the night\
  \ before the trip was over we had a little goodby party. And I felt a huge need\
  \ of being near him that night. The music was really loud and that's when it happened.\
  \ I left Vienna without being able to say goodbye.  \n\nThree years later when I\
  \ went back I found the place were they got together, and when I got there I felt\
  \ uneasy as I thought they might wouldn't remember me. I opened the door I heard\
  \ a familiar voice shouting another person -malaka, your friend!  When I scanned\
  \ my surroundings I couldn't believe it, all the greeks were there! \n\nTo my surprise\
  \ there were in Vienna just for the weekend for a fair the austrians had organized.\
  \ R wasn't there and I was told he wouldn\u2019t be joining us that night, nevertheless\
  \ they invited me to all the activities they had programmed. \n\nI had lots of fun\
  \  but, I couldn\u2019t seem to ran into him. Finally on my last night some of us\
  \ were at a bar chatting on how to change the world and from nowhere someone shouted\
  \ his name. \n\nWe said hi and looked at each other awkwardly, I felt so out of\
  \ place. We stayed quiet for a minute and then our eyes crossed and suddenly all\
  \ the awkwardness and guilt went away. \n\nHis smile was the one I remembered, and\
  \ we just hugged a beautiful and sincere hug."
