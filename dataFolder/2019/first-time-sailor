Text: "Old-time sailors had a glorious saying:\n\u201CSailing is necessary, living\
  \ is not necessary\u201D\nI want to take with me the spirit [of] this phrase,\n\
  Transforming its form to adjust to who I am \n\nThese are the words of my beloved\
  \ Fernando Pessoa, a Portuguese writer, which the world should know more.  Pessoa,\
  \ in my view, had a way to express a traveler lust for the unknown. So profoundly\
  \ that made me daydream about adventures in the high sea and feel like I was walking\
  \ in the old dark streets of Portugal. Combine it with slideshows from a trip my\
  \ father did to Italy I came across the idea of working on cruise ships. Yup, I\
  \ set sail!\nIt was the weirdest and most amazing nine months of my life. Every\
  \ port a different scenario, people from all around the world worked on the ship\
  \ and I was going to place I never thought I'd go or knew existed.\nOne of these\
  \ places was the mystical Falkland Islands. I always wanted to visit the UK, but\
  \ far from my wild dreams could I imagine it more exotic.\nA seamless barren land\
  \ with strong waves hid under those waters curious and cheerful dolphins that emerged\
  \ from underneath it from time to time. They swan so closely along the boat that\
  \ I had the impression that if I was brave enough to put my hand in the freezing\
  \ water I could touch them. My first time I seeing dolphins and they being wild\
  \ animals was the icing on my cake. \nAs we docked on land, I was hit by a biting\
  \ cold wind which was warmed by friendly locals that were available to explain all\
  \ things related to the islands and book any tour anyone wishes for. From whales\
  \ sighting on the high sea, the penguin's at the beach, sea lions on the fisherman's\
  \ port, a real Darwin's daydream tour (by the way, he lived on the islands on his\
  \ world exploration tour that resulted on his evolutionary theory.\nThe city of\
  \ Stanley was grey, windy and very British. The brick houses, tarts on shops, wool\
  \ and sheep's related goods, made me feel like I was in the UK alright. The only\
  \ remembrance of its location was the wartime memorials and maps of the Islands\
  \ geographical whereabouts (and those poles with main city names and its distances\
  \ from that spot). I walked around got into a store, got my fair share of After\
  \ Eights and teas, call back home from a red Telephone booth and then out of sheer\
  \ curiosity I came close to a local which was putting away his sheep in a barn and\
  \ asked: Why the war against Argentina? \nThe shepherd shot me a wary look but replied\
  \ anyway. 'Petrol' he said in a strong morose British manner. \"We were always here.\
  \ Taking care of our sheep, the old folks on the whaling industry, others on fishery...\
  \ But then they found petrol underwater and started to plead it as their own\u2026\
  . You see, we don't even speak Spanish.\" And that was my Aha moment. The moment\
  \ when I realized that befriend with anyone that allowed me a chat would make me\
  \ immerse in their stories, in their daily lives. I asked him some more on the island\
  \ daily shores, their main breadwinning affairs and discovery a very simple, down\
  \ to the earth people. People with ordinary lives, that had it all turned upside\
  \ down and be on the entire world news headlines by political affairs that they\
  \ didn't ask to be part of. And as the war ended, all came back to the same old\
  \ days.\nThese unknown people shared so little of their daily lives, but they gave\
  \ me so much that I am eternally thankful. Unknowingly they helped build my character\
  \ and opened my mind to the new. Sharing their truth they made me sure that the\
  \ road is the best school you can get."
