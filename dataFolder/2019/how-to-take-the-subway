Text: "When you grow up in a small town in Brazil - a city that no-one knows, if you\
  \ may, there is a lot of things you can fit in \"unknown\" territory. My city is\
  \ small, with over 18,000 inhabitants, and everyone knows who you are by asking\
  \ a simple question, such as: \"Who is your father?\", being that way I was always\
  \ known by my grandfather's name, my father's profession, and the way they interacted\
  \ with people - never because of the women, the ones who truly shaped me to be the\
  \ way I am. There are no buses, no big parks, no shopping malls, and, basically,\
  \ none of the things you see in a movie, or a TV show.\n\nAfter I got into college,\
  \ however, things changed a little bit. My college campus was in another town, not\
  \ the biggest, but, to me, it was the greatest thing I've ever seen. After a while,\
  \ going back and forth between to cities in order to study, I finally moved away\
  \ from my parents' nest an got to live on my own. With that, the first big challenge:\
  \ how am i supposed to take the bus? There were people surrounding me at the bus\
  \ stop, and the only thing that would go through my mind was how was i supposed\
  \ to look nonchalant and like I knew what I was doing when I clearly didn't. With\
  \ the help of some friends, I got in the bus, nodded to the bus driver, paid for\
  \ my ticket, and found a place to sit in the overcrowded bus. In time, and with\
  \ a lot of errors, I mastered the \"bus-taking\", only once getting lost, and feeling\
  \ very proud of my accomplishments. I thought I was officially a grown-up, and knew\
  \ my way through the world. \n\nHow wrong was I.\n\nIn the beginning of 2019, I've\
  \ done probably one of the weirdest little journeys ever. My father is a truck driver,\
  \ he knows most of the country with the back of his hand. He knows things like:\
  \ where you should eat when you don't want to pay more than anyone should; which\
  \ road to take if you want to get to your destination as quickly as possible; where\
  \ to sleep if you don't want to get robbed in the middle of the night; and, most\
  \ importantly, he knows how to drop me off at my friend's house - a friend I've\
  \ met through the wonderful internet, and got to live some of the greatest adventures\
  \ a girl could wish for, even if said adventures are watching movies together, and\
  \ yelling about how \"Ocean's Eight\" is empowering. \n\nMy friend lives in a city\
  \ next to S\xE3o Paulo, and that was the place I've wanted to visit for a long time.\
  \ So there we went. By truck.\n\nIt took us two days to get to my friend's house,\
  \ and then a few hours by car to get to the capital. Getting there was insane. I\
  \ had never seen buildings so big, and so many people, and music coming off of the\
  \ street with people milling around to see. It was a city so alive I could only\
  \ look up and stare at that people - people who lived there every single day, saw\
  \ that every single day.\n\nBut the craziest part was: the subway. I had never taken\
  \ the subway before. It was remarkable. I didn't know where to go, how to position\
  \ myself, so I just hugged my friend's arm, and joined the ride. There were people\
  \ sleeping, people watching Netflix, people selling things, people looking around\
  \ so they wouldn't nod off and miss their stop. I've never felt more alive than\
  \ in the subway, surrounded in the worst way possible, feeling tingles all over\
  \ my body for where people would unknowingly touch. In that crowded place, I realized\
  \ how small I was, and how that is, not always, a bad thing."
