Text: "I arrived in New York on January 27. As expected, I was hoping for the trip\
  \ of my life. I had never been abroad and did not know what I was going to find\
  \ in the Big Apple. However, more than what I found in and about the city, I was\
  \ surprised by what I found out about myself. \n\tWalking alone through Times Square\
  \ after having brunch in Queens (a delicious cheese sandwich and a vodka and something-pink\
  \ drink) with my brother, I had to rely on my GPS to guide me out of the luminous\
  \ street and find a small store to buy a parka to face the rainy days to come. There\
  \ I found a salesperson who could speak Portuguese and loved Brazilian music. He\
  \ sold me a beautiful parka, which I am never going to let go, and told me about\
  \ the cool things that I could do while staying in the city.\n\tOne of the things\
  \ I wanted to do was to eat pierogies at an Ukranian restaurant, so I went there\
  \ on my first Monday night with a friend from India who lived in Manhattan. They\
  \ were as delicious as I was expecting. I also wanted to go to John Lennon\u2019\
  s memorial Strawberry Fields at the Central Park. While I was there, I felt a different\
  \ kind of energy, as if my heart found peace for a second and got back to reality.\
  \ I met many Brazilians there, they were friendly to me and took my picture. I sat\
  \ there for a while, observed people walking and felt some kind of happiness, remembering\
  \ my favorite Beatles songs and feeling the cold air on my nose.\n\tI had Chinese\
  \ food in a restaurant close to my brother\u2019s office, which he did not know\
  \ about, even though he had lived there for two years. I found out how different\
  \ it was compared to the Chinese food I had had back home. Walking the city alone\
  \ was helpful in so many ways, as in not following his steps everywhere, or I would\
  \ have only met the places he knows, and it would have been a limited experience.\
  \ \n\tIn two days I walked the Natural History Museum and went to the MET, had a\
  \ great time walking in Midtown Manhattan and when I took the ferry to Staten Island\
  \ listening to music, feeling the cold air blow my hair and seeing the Statue of\
  \ Liberty, I realized that I was way more independent than I had thought. My brother\
  \ was there only to open his apartment for me at the end of the day, that was all\
  \ he did. \nI ate, I drank, I walked, I saw art and artists in action and I could\
  \ not have had a better couple of days to discover part of a city and part of myself.\
  \ We connected, but I did not expect to find that New York would unveil my most\
  \ independent side."
