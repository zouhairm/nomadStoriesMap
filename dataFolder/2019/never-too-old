Text: "I dragged my bike off the rough track across to the lava plug and sat down,\
  \ pleased to have found shelter from the freezing wind and snow showers for the\
  \ first time that morning. It was a very monochromatic world- to my right black\
  \ lava fields stretched to the northern horizon, and on my left lay the imposing\
  \ icewalls of the Vatnaj\xF6kull Icecap. Sue, my wife and riding companion, came\
  \ over to join me, her bike bouncing on the lava nodules. We were in a storm in\
  \ the most remote part of the most remote (and highest) route in the highlands of\
  \ Iceland, the G\xE6savatnalei\xF0-  the feeling of isolation was palpable and we\
  \ loved it.\n\nSo, what was our journey to reach this point? How did two New Zealanders\
  \ in their late fifties end up being in such a wild and remote location? The short\
  \ answer would be to describe our seven day journey, begun in the northern Iceland\
  \ town of Akureyri; the endless corrugations of the F88 mountain road as we headed\
  \ into the interior through the \xD3d\xE1\xF0ahraun Desert, the crossing of the\
  \ Dyngjusandur sands, traversing the wide glacial outwash plains of the vast Vatnaj\xF6\
  kull Icecap as they filled with meltwater, and the rocky climb past the ancient\
  \ Ur\xF0arh\xE1ls crater to Kistufell hut.\nBut really, our journey began well before\
  \ that, about three years prior to be precise. Out of nowhere Sue had said: \u201C\
  I want to go cycle touring again\u201D. Never mind that our last multi-day cycle\
  \ trip was 27 years ago. For me, to go cycle touring would be a leap into the unknown-\
  \ although keen mountain bikers, our rides were typically only a few hours long\
  \ but cycle touring for days on end? Really? Sue was insistent and began talking\
  \ about Tuscany. Resigned to my fate, I liked the thought of a bit more challenge.\
  \ \u201CWhat about Iceland?\u201D. A short pause from Sue, then \u201COK\u201D.\
  \ That was it, no matter we knew nothing about biking in Iceland, the die had been\
  \ cast.\n\nA year later we arrived at Keflavik after the long journey from New Zealand.\
  \ We had decided to travel in the Icelandic spring (it turned out to be the coldest\
  \ May in 39 years!)  While the weather was challenging, we just loved the raw and\
  \ open countryside, and more than anything, we loved the sense of freedom that the\
  \ bike travel gave us- freedom that you take for granted in your 20\u2019s but is\
  \ gradually lost as you take on life\u2019s responsibilities.\nResidual winter snow\
  \ had meant the interior roads traversing the highlands were closed- but our appetites\
  \ were whetted and we were keen to explore Iceland more. So a year later we were\
  \ back, this time in September with the interior roads open. We planned to ride\
  \ from the south through the impossibly green hills leading to Landmannalaugar,\
  \ and then north through the barren Sprengisandur Desert of the interior. \nFor\
  \ many cyclists, the Sprengisandur would be a biking hell- rough roads, river crossings,\
  \ days of barren volcanic rock and sand, scything headwinds, cold temperatures,\
  \ and rain. To be honest we had our desperate moments in the five days it took us\
  \ to cross its 200km length, but we also loved experiencing the vast open expanse\
  \ of this wilderness and its feeling of isolation. Camping under the northern lights\
  \ was a bucket list item for certain, the 100+ km/hr winds the next morning not\
  \ so much!\n\nOn that journey, we had paused at the crossroads that led to the G\xE6\
  savatnalei\xF0 but decided to heed the warnings about snow on this isolated route\
  \ and continued north. But the G\xE6savatnalei\xF0 remained an itch to be scratched\u2026\
  \n\nAnd so here we were on our third trip to Iceland, on the G\xE6savatnalei\xF0\
  \ and sheltering from a storm behind a lava plug.  After 10 minutes rest it was\
  \ time to head back out into the weather. We reckoned it would take another two\
  \ days to reach the mountain hut at N\xFDidalur, maybe more if the glacial rivers\
  \ were running high, but now well attuned to travelling through this wild landscape,\
  \ we moved on with guarded confidence. Who said adventure was just for the young!"
