Text: "It was a perfect winter morning as my beautiful girlfriend slept I woke extra\
  \ early to make coffee read my favorite article in the paper; the travel section\
  \ this Sunday it was about a blind 65year old women who traveled alone to Agentia\
  \ and how the aromas of the country gave her new life. Before my beloved would wake\
  \ I made her favorite Mickey Mouse pancakes with a bacon bow tie. Just in time she\
  \ join me at the table but this mornings energy was different. You know when you\
  \ can just feel something is a miss? It was hard for her to look at me then I knew\
  \ something was wrong as her eyes watered with tears automatically so did mine.\
  \ With her voice shaking she uttered the words of my worst nightmares. \u201CMichal?\u201D\
  \ I don\u2019t know how to love you anymore.\u201D As my life sunk to the bottom\
  \ of my empty stomach with all my sense fading she walk away from me. I sat in disbelief\
  \ for hours. Finally I stood dumped her cold breakfast in the trash. Life seemed\
  \ to be a big fat lie. I tried to remember the truth of anything days past and I\
  \ still tried to remember truth. What is true? The only thing I could remember was\
  \ the Blind women who traveled to Agentina and found new life. That was it! I dropped\
  \ everything quite my unfulfilling jop cashed out my retirement sold all my belongings\
  \ and bought the first ticket I found online and \u201Cblindly\u201D hope on a plane\
  \ with one carry-on and flow to Argentina in search to find love; in in another\
  \ but in life. I wanted to know how it felt to love life agian."
