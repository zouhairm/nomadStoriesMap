Text: "How did I meet Andrea? Or should I ask \"Why did I meet Andrea?\".. Why am\
  \ I here standing under  the building looking at someone I barely know balcony while\
  \ he is waving at me happily from his apartment?\nMaybe because I believe we are\
  \ magnets to whatever we think of or truly want. And at this specific time of my\
  \ life, all what I needed is inspiration and some interesting people to refresh\
  \ my soul.. that's why I came here, solo, to Prague.\nI arrived to Prague late night,\
  \ which made me woke up late the following day. In a hurry to roam around the city,\
  \ I managed to find a coffee shop close to the hotel to grab a quick coffee and\
  \ a cold sandwich.\nWhile trying to enjoy the few minutes of caffeine, there was\
  \ a guy inside in the coffee shop laughing loudly, talking with the owner of the\
  \ coffee place like they knew each other very well. The loud guy kept staring at\
  \ me every two minutes.. I felt a bit uncomfortable.\n Wearing a black tshirt, red\
  \ open shirt, baggy shorts, tattoos all around his neck and arms, blue ocean eyes\
  \ and two different socks, Andrea approached my table slowly.\n\"May I tell you\
  \ something?\" he asked politely.\n\"sure\" I replied with a poker face.\n\"you\
  \ have white powder all over your face from the sandwich you are eating.. just saying!\"\
  \ he replied while raising his arms in the air like he doesn't care.\nI paid my\
  \ check and got ready to go out, as soon as I woke out the coffee shop door, Andrea\
  \ followed me.\n\"hey, hey.. what\u2019s your name?\" he yelled while laughing at\
  \ my embarrassed face.\n\"Mirna\" I replied smiling.\n\"Andrea. Living here in this\
  \ building. I will wait for you tomorrow morning for coffee date. Over and out.\
  \ Enjoy your day!\". He replied while waving at the invisible audience like the\
  \ theatre actors when they finish the play.\nRoaming around Prague was super. Watching\
  \ the sunset from Charles Bridge was magical. I inhaled the view as if I wanted\
  \ it to draw it as deep and detailed as I can in my memory.\nFinishing the day with\
  \ half a duck on dinner, made it a  perfect first day at this city.\nThe following\
  \ day, something urged me to go meet Andrea.. I Went to the coffee shop as he said\
  \ yesterday.. to find him waving at me from his first floor apartment balcony, asking\
  \ me to go up for a surprise!\nShould I go? What if he is a serial killer targeting\
  \ solo female travelers? I decided to go up to Andrea.. at least they would write\
  \ I died out of adventure instead of dying out the fear of the unknown.\nAndrea\
  \ is an Italian bohemian guy, managed to move in Prague five years ago, in his second\
  \ year he created an application which eventually became prague's official application\
  \ for events and festivals. \n\"I drowned myself in work. I was running away from\
  \ the bad memories I had in Germany.\" said Andrea in a low voice while eating the\
  \ pasta he made.\nHe believes that whenever someone cooks for someone special, God\
  \ bless your life and erase one of your sins. He learned that from his beloved Italian\
  \ mother.\n\"Dirty spaghetti\" that's what his girlfriend extreme grandmother  used\
  \ to call him. Her parents never wanted their daughter to be in a relationship with\
  \ an Italian guy, they always saw themselves as Germans more superior. Andrea never\
  \ minded the racism as long as she loves him and he loves her. But eventually love\
  \ is gone.. and Andrea ran away to Prague hoping  for a fresh new start.\nWe ended\
  \ the night looking at Charles bridge lights.. \n\"I feel you will come back one\
  \ day to Prague.. to live here\" Andrea said.\n\"I feel I will come back because\
  \ we are here now together and the moment is magical. But I also know that when\
  \ my feet touch the airport ground.. this feeling will fade because if I learned\
  \ one thing of life.. It would be to never get attached to a place.. because we\
  \ will always be forced to leave.\""
