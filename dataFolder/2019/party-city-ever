Text: "Before I got on the coach, my phone fell down and the screen broken. This was\
  \ my first time taking REJIOJET. The coach, which offers hot drink and entertainment.\
  \ At 8 pm, I arrived Budapest. I spent an hour finding the ticket machine and the\
  \ hostel. My first impression of Budapest is a party city. There was a party bus\
  \ that played loud music driving through. From the window, I saw people dancing\
  \ on the bus. People were crowed on the street, they seem like ahead to the pub\
  \ or club. It was Friday night.\n\nI lived in the center. The hostel was not easy\
  \ to find. Especially, I carried a 29-inch suitcase, a sport bag and a backpack.\
  \ I finally checked-in and started to arrange my stuffs. Two Spanish girls, my roommates,\
  \ talked to me. I told them I was on my 35-day journey, traveling around Europe.\
  \ I just finished the internship in Italy. And they said, they study exchange in\
  \ the UK. I saw they were dressed, \u201CAre you going somewhere?\u201D \u201CYes.\
  \ My friend, he is a local, will take us to a bar. Would you like to come with us?\u201D\
  \ \n\nIn 10 minutes, I grabbed the purse and the screen broken phone. We walked\
  \ to the bar and talked. We got to the bar, only a word to describe: Amazing. I\
  \ will say it is the best bar I even been. Unique drinks, music and decoration in\
  \ different rooms. I just arrived, not changed the currency yet. So, he bought the\
  \ drink for me. I couldn\u2019t taste what the difference. But he said\u201D Don\u2019\
  t drink the beer, you should taste Hungarian wine.\u201D\n\nOn the next day, I joined\
  \ the free tour. My first experience of free tour. Honestly, I had no idea the history\
  \ of Budapest. But the guide taught a lot, I love it. We crossed the bridge to the\
  \ castle in Pest side. Matthias Church is the most beautiful church I ever visited.\
  \ From outside to inside, the decorative design, the architecture, and the painting\
  \ are incredible. \n\nIn the morning, I left the message to new friends. We planned\
  \ to have the spa at night. The local, he led us to the hill. From the hostel, we\
  \ started to run and run. At the moment, I was like a teenager doing some crazy\
  \ things. I felt the young. It was not easy to hike due to the heavy rain and our\
  \ tired body. We were so wet but we did it; we were standing on the top, joying\
  \ next to the Liberty Statue, and watching the sunset.\n\nAt first, I did not plan\
  \ to go spa. After meeting two Spanish girls, we decided to go together. I was lucky\
  \ that the office offers swimming suit rent service. I paid the entr\xE9e and rental\
  \ fee. \u201CThis time, nothing can stop me\u201D, I said to myself. I am always\
  \ shy that I never go to public hot spring in Taiwan. This was my first time, wearing\
  \ such less in front of people. I am glad I convince myself to have the spa. The\
  \ funniest activity I ever had. Playing with foreign tourists and soaking in the\
  \ warm spa. All of us were pretty enjoyed. \n\nChinese New Year is like Christmas\
  \ which is very important to Asian. We have the family reunion on New Year\u2019\
  s Eve. However, this was the first time I were not with them. My friends were leaving\
  \ for UK. I became alone on the third day. I opened the paper map, and walked around\
  \ the cities. I took the old tram, which is must to take. I love the desserts and\
  \ snacks here. They\u2019re very cheap and tasty. Tonight, I was going to leave.\
  \ I had my own reunion meal in a Hungarian restaurant. I have to say, taste the\
  \ Hungarian beef soup, you won\u2019t regret. \n\nIt is not only a party city. No\
  \ words can describe my love to Budapest. I just met her for two days. But I already\
  \ fell in love here. Like a Londoner I met in the hostel, he loves Budapest and\
  \ already stayed a month. \n\nHappy Chinese New Year to my friends and Budapest."
