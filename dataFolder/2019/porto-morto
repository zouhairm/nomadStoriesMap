Text: "Porto feels like a tanned boy with long, messy hair. The one with a tattoo\
  \ and a cigarette, casually wandering around in his worn out sneakers. It\u2019\
  s the sort of guy you\u2019d hesitate to introduce to your parents, but you\u2019\
  d keep walking behind him on the street, strangely attracted, hypnotized.\n\nThis\
  \ city was made to get lost in. Not big, but with many layers, Porto goes up and\
  \ down, turns and ends, without any logic. You can try to save yourself by remembering\
  \ some characteristic points: the plaza decorated with bunch of jellyfish made of\
  \ paper, the corner where a gang of skinny cats blankly stares at seagulls or the\
  \ dusty shop with old chandeliers. But, either way, the city always deceives you.\n\
  \nMorning\nWhen the elegant old men take the first sip of their morning coffee,\
  \ the day is officially ready to begin. Trying to get away from the rush of the\
  \ main street, I turn into a smaller street \u2013 and later another small one \u2013\
  \ and after a while I realize that somebody is lying on the cardboards, hidden in\
  \ the corner. The person is wrapped in a dirty, old sleeping bag, blonde hair sticking\
  \ out. Two steps more and I can see a young face with two contradictory elements:\
  \ big, messy beard and fair eyes, definitely not looking like a local. We look at\
  \ each other \u2013 and nothing happens, he simply comes back to his sleeping bag,\
  \ not ready for the day. I feet strange need to wake him up and whisper \u2013 \u201E\
  Go back to your home\u201D \u2013 but instead, I keep walking. In the distance I\
  \ can see the parallel street, flooded with sun \u2013 it's full of people rushing\
  \ to work, shopping, driving, living. I'm still in between. The boy stays behind,\
  \ sleeping in the shadow. \n\nAfternoon\nThe water of Douro splashes when a body\
  \ hits the surface of the river. Somebody jumps from the lower deck of the Luis\
  \ I bridge, 15 meters down. The tourists, with cameras grabbed in their hands, hold\
  \ their breaths \u2013 until the boy's head appears on the surface. He's laughing,\
  \ waving his hands to those watching him, the water drops shimmer in his black hair.\
  \ Then the other lad starts to collect money among the crowd \u2013 because it's\
  \ only a show, just a bold flirtation among the youthness and the abyss. No wonder\
  \ that on the sticker with the official logo of the city somebody changed one letter\
  \ \u2013 and \u201EPorto\u201D became \u201EMorto\u201D \u2013 \u201Edead\u201D\
  \ in Portuguese.\n\nNight\nThe rosy sky above the Ribeira is slowly changing into\
  \ navy blue, stars popping and little silhouettes of ships looming in the distance.\
  \ Tourists chatter, their francesinhas get cold and glasses \u2013 empty of wine.\
  \ They should soon return to their houses \u2013 rented apartments with huge windows\
  \ and wooden shutters \u2013 just one more fado song, just one more blast of salty\
  \ air, just one more look at the moonlit river. I leave them there, tipsy and tender,\
  \ and go in the direction of Pra\xE7a da Rep\xFAblica. Suddenly, on the lantern,\
  \ I spot a small announcement. It's just a piece of paper with a handwrite saying:\
  \ \u201EMy name was Osvaldo. Now is Gusto Savdo\u201D. I turn around as if the author\
  \ of this statement was standing next to me \u2013 but I can\u2019t see anyone.\
  \ The labyrinth of the narrow streets is dark and empty.\n\nDo you also miss some\
  \ cities as if they were human? I do. I miss the smell, the character, the taste\
  \ of Porto. After two years I still keep thinking how would it be to leave everything\
  \ behind and just buy one way ticket. \nAnd find the blonde, lost boy.\nAnd jump\
  \ with the fearless Portuguese boys straight to the cold river. \nAnd ask Gusto\
  \ how does it feel to be reborn in Porto, the most decadent city in the whole world."
