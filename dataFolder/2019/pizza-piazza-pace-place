Text: "\u201CIt has to be here! I know it\u2019s in this piazza!\u201D I exhaled breathlessly,\
  \ after the seventh lap around Campo Santa Maria Formosa. Frustrated by hunger and\
  \ the failure of my usually sound sense of direction, it didn\u2019t matter that\
  \ the piazza was actually a campo, that the restaurant had closed hours ago, and\
  \ that several locals watched in amusement as two girls ran around the square, cameras\
  \ bouncing, yelling at each other in English. \n\tVenice in late January is not\
  \ the teeming tourist mecca it is during the summer months. Locals reclaim their\
  \ streets, piazzas and cafes while heavy grey skies cast a somber mood across the\
  \ floating city. My sister and I had come to La Serenissima for research (she was\
  \ writing her senior thesis at Princeton), and I for renewal and inspiration (as\
  \ an underemployed artist, and her translator). Native New Yorkers both, our deeply\
  \ ingrained go-go-go mentality defined our travel style. Don\u2019t stop until you\
  \ drop. If the museum, church, or historic site is within walking distance, you\
  \ must see it. If people are too slow on the sidewalk, dodge them like you\u2019\
  re in a human video game. Every minute of your day in a new place must be packed\
  \ with enriching visits and photo ops\u2014leisurely lunches are for the weak. Foot\
  \ pain and blisters are badges of honor.\n\tLike much of Italy, Venice is an inexhaustible\
  \ smorgasbord of art and architecture, and we had feasted. Each evening, we returned\
  \ to the tiny Hotel Paganelli, cold and tired to the bone, with blurred memories\
  \ of all that we had seen that day. Thank goodness for multi-gigabyte memory cards\
  \ that would allow us to relive the numerous Bellini altarpieces, bird\u2019s eye\
  \ views from bell towers, and luscious mounds of gelato heaped with whole fruits\
  \ and flowers. Our overfilled itineraries did not allow for much time to bask in\
  \ the awe of these sights, or to savor these flavors for more than a few minutes--\
  \ let alone have a conversation with the older gentleman who could tell us the entire\
  \ history of the Scuola di San Rocco or learn how such sculptural forms could be\
  \ produced from milk and sugar from the gelataia herself. Mid-lick, I would check\
  \ my watch and realize that we were minutes away from the last ferry to Torcello.\
  \ Off and running with a \u201Cgrazie, ciao,\u201D gelato in hand like true New\
  \ York tourists.\n\tThen, mid-sprint around the Campo Santa Maria Formosa in search\
  \ of the holy grail of panini, came a realization. Perhaps it was the dawning of\
  \ a new approach to travel. Or maybe it was just a product of pure fatigue and desperation\u2014\
  but it was a reckoning nonetheless that shapes how I experience new places today.\
  \ My dogged pursuit of that highly-reviewed-online-porchetta sandwich kept me from\
  \ seeing the real Venice, the January Venice, the post-Natale/pre-Carnevale Venice\
  \ of the Venetians. The quiet and slow, wet and sleepy Venice where cafes and restaurants\
  \ close at 5pm because most residents will be eating dinner at home with their families.\
  \ The Venice where afternoons are spent in a stop-and go meander in the Biennale\
  \ Gardens, humans trailing their waddling, sweater-wearing dogs (one named Peggy,\
  \ no doubt in homage to famed arts patron Peggy Guggenheim). The price paid for\
  \ my frenzied pace was any real appreciation of the people who make a place what\
  \ it is as a living, breathing community. A place is its history, its built environment,\
  \ its art and architecture, climate, plants and animals\u2014but moreover, the people\
  \ who steward and advance all these elements. By taking the time to understand the\
  \ people who perpetuate the culture of a place, be it as a producer of S-shaped\
  \ butter cookies or Carnevale masks sold on the Rialto bridge, or a maker of lace\
  \ hand-stitched on the island of Burano, the visitor attains a fulfillment far beyond\
  \ a full stomach or suitcase. I needed to change my pace in order to experience\
  \ place. This evolution is on-going with each trip I take. I know when I return\
  \ to Venice, there will be less running around campos and much more conversation,\
  \ patient observation, meandering, and mindful appreciation."
