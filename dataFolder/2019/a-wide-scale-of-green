Text: "I live in a small house in the jungle slightly up on a hill. When I look out\
  \ from my big terrace I see a long stretch of grass and palm trees, maybe even pines.\
  \ You might have seen this beach scene with pines and palm trees and this white\
  \ sand. It's like that but raw.\nMonsoon is approaching so the air is dripping.\
  \ It rains a bit every day, more it pours. This fearless rain is beautiful but I\
  \ start to feel that none of my clothes ever dry. Everything is damp.\nI get up\
  \ early. Usually between 6 and 7. I usually put on my shoes and start walking. It\
  \ takes about 7 minutes to the beach. I bought a reusable iced coffee mug the other\
  \ day that says \u201Cfuck the world\u201D, the other option was \u201Csave the\
  \ world\u201D - reusable seams nice enough. Coffee on the way - no one is at the\
  \ beach this early. What a big water does to one's soul. The ocean here is calm.\
  \ There is never weather in the water. Sometimes I go in the water and float. \n\
  Today I come back to my house and get on my scooter. It's an old Honda dream with\
  \ a kick start that I bought from a diver that was moving on to work on Fiji. I\
  \ love riding it. It's pretty slow and I haven't entirely figured out the gears\
  \ taking all the hills on this island. the way this rocky dreamer shakes up my lymphs\
  \ though makes me feel alive and awake. I drive 15 minutes to a coffee shop by the\
  \ pier. It's a coffee shop with flat whites and filter coffee. I go here today because\
  \ I realized last night it's maybe time to find some people that like similar things\
  \ than I do. I get very comfortable hanging out alone that I start to forget about\
  \ social situations. \nA small kitten came to my house about four days ago. I named\
  \ her Tiffy after the Sesame Street Character and feed her now. The first two days\
  \ she laid on my legs and slept, now she chases through my house like a mad monkey.\
  \ Some nights she disappears and I like how she comes so close and then leaves.\
  \ I watch her playing in the grass around the house.\nI go to the beach around the\
  \ corner called \u201Czen\u201D to see the sunset. All the hippies and yoga dolls\
  \ go here for their sundown drumming and playing in the sand. No one here frowns\
  \ at me for smoking filter cigarettes on the beach. They are truly open. People\
  \ here know each other. Sometimes someone will come and talk to me. It feels like\
  \ after a while of being here you just automatically fade in. The nice thing about\
  \ these vacation places is that people are so used to having new people around that\
  \ it's hard to feel like an outsider. There is so many different stories on this\
  \ beach right now and somehow everyone knows that.\nAt the beach I am invited to\
  \ go to a steam room up on a hill and when I arrive there is what they call a singing\
  \ bowl concert happening. About 10 people lie around a bonfire others stroll. The\
  \ man that owns this place is an older dude from Boston with long white hair in\
  \ a ponytail. He built a huge crystal altar and sells cookies. I chew away half\
  \ of one and dive into the small steamy dome. It looks like an iglu from the outside.\
  \ \nInside there is a big bellied naked Russian that starts chanting bassy notes\
  \ and makes the entire dome vibrate. \nWhen I come outside it had started pouring\
  \ and crazy lightning and thunder surround the mountain top. Most people had left\
  \ but the fire is still slightly going. \nI take my scooter home and fly through\
  \ the dark humming jungle. I am very distracted by everything around me. The senses\
  \ are out there and they attack me with the softest gentle breeze. \nWhen I close\
  \ my eyes passing over is just a breath away and the line fades into a wide scale\
  \ of green and moist heat."
