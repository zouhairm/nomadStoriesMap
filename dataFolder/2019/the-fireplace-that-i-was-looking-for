Text: "Three, two, one, landed successfully but wait, where am I? Is it a dream, a\
  \ nightmare or what? This is what I first thought when I got out of my hotel the\
  \ day one in Beijing. The strong smell of the metropolis suddenly enter in my nostrils,\
  \ the earsplitting noise of the mopeds was challenging my ears, the cold of the\
  \ harsh Chinese winter was giving a hard time to my wracked body after an exhausting\
  \ flight over half globe. Nothing seemed to be able to warm my ice cube limbs, or\
  \ at least so I thought. I was walking around the neighbourhood trying to find the\
  \ way to the subway when, with the corner of my eyes I glimpsed a little entrance,\
  \ beyond it tables brimful with vegetables and meat were ruling the scene, a place\
  \ so crowded with people and colours to make anyone, just with a single glance,\
  \ overcome with a feeling of warmth and a sense of spontaneous joy. That was the\
  \ fireplace that I was looking for. It was in a heart beat that all those chaotic\
  \ sounds turned into a symphony of clattering pots and shouting sellers, the intense\
  \ smell become a unique fragrance of thousands dishes altogether.  I was wandering\
  \ amazed when I heard a woman screaming \u201C\u5916\u56FD\u4EBA\uFF0C\u8FC7\u6765\
  \u201D (foreigner, come here), so, with my broken Chinese and armed with a lot of\
  \ curiosity I stepped forward, trying to find a way through all that cram. It was\
  \ then, after having crossed a living river of people that I finally managed to\
  \ have her taped: an elderly lady was standing behind her stall while cooking one\
  \ of the traditional food in china \u6742\u7CAE\u714E\u997C. It\u2019s amazing noticing\
  \ the different concept of foreigners world-wide: here for example they\u2019re\
  \ seen like a treasure that comes from a land far away, like a not to be missed\
  \ chance of meeting the different. She called me as a lovely grandma would do with\
  \ her grandchild, with the inquisitivene eyes of a child, with the wisdom of an\
  \ old woman who experienced the world on her skin. This is how our meeting happened,\
  \ this is how I met the real china, the China that I fell in love for. Few sentences\
  \ has been necessary for entering in her secret world, so far at the first sight.\
  \ \u201CWhere are you from? What are you doing here?\u201D are the first questions,\
  \ the usual ones a person from outside would dare say, but not for us. For us has\
  \ been the beginning of a long day of sharing cultures, tasting food, understanding\
  \ different ideas and concepts of life despite the languages difficulties. This\
  \ is how suddenly I found myself closing jiaozi and understanding their deeper meaning.\
  \ It\u2019s in a square of dough that in China you can communicate being part of\
  \ a family, it was that day that I\u2019ve understood how important the traditions\
  \ and the value of the family are for Chinese through the stories of an loving grandma\
  \ that everyday goes to the street market for paying the calligraphy classes on\
  \ her granddaughter. It was her who taught me the importance of inclusion and the\
  \ simplicity of the life with her invitation to join their ritual dancing at sunset\
  \ in the square close to her little shop. It\u2019s her, who taught me how much\
  \ the proverbs have a central role in the Chineses\u2019 lives. Teaching me one\
  \ of them that I\u2019ll keep forever in my heart: \u80CC\u4E95\u79BB\u4E61 which\
  \ means leave one\u2019s native place, wandering looking for our own place. She\
  \ saw me for a couple of ours but with her empathy she she dug deeper than people\
  \ that I\u2019ve known for decades, with her smiling faced seamed with wrinkles\
  \ she managed to warm my heart and the teach me things that I could have never expected\
  \ changing my idea of china forever. Everything happened for fortune, fate, casualty.\
  \ It\u2019s because of this luck that I could have a peep at the strong roots of\
  \ the Chinese culture and meeting such a wonderful woman."
