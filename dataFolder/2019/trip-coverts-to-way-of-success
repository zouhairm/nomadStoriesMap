Text: I started trip to canada in 2018, but fortunately spending 2 months over there
  and seeing their local culture it find me to step-out and generated a new opportunity.
  Its a country where a people can love and live life in his own way without any inferences
  of other. One can make his life or at same time he may destroy but at last its in
  his own hand what to do with his life. What do you love most about fall? Is it apple
  picking, pumpkin spice lattes or the cooler temps? My favourite thing are the colours
  and scenic drives that make a person  appreciate the new season. The scenic drive
  to and around the area is exactly what I experienced during our first fall weekend
  in Peterborough & The Kawarthas. I was pleasantly surprised to also experience the
  food, entertainment, arts & history that the area has to offer. I tried to experience
  as much as I could during my weekend so here is my quick recap. Now getting crafty
  with Ontario nature one can drive his vacation adventurers close to nature. Their
  are lots of activity to do such as para-glinding, bungee jump and many more. So
  here is the my short travel history describing Ontario trip.
