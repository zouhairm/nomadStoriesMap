Text: "\u201CSu-go-ii\u2026\u201D we whisper in unison, our eyes widening in awe as\
  \ they trace upwards along the hundreds of majestic bamboo trees before us. When\
  \ our gaze meets the flickering sunlight at the top, we finally remember to breathe.\
  \ This is indeed amazing, a word I can now say in Japanese, thanks to friends who\
  \ were but strangers just an hour ago.\n\nI had stepped off the train in Kamakura\
  \ excited but nervous. Having spent just 20 minutes researching this place, I nearly\
  \ caught the wrong train, and didn\u2019t really know what to expect. But after\
  \ three days in bustling, glass-towered Tokyo, I needed this. The promise of \u201C\
  Little Kyoto\u201D, just an hour to the south, had been enough. I craved the contrast\
  \ and old-school beauty, the Japan of myth and legend.\n\nThere was a magic about\
  \ this place. In a single morning I was already a changed woman - my traveler\u2019\
  s hustle interrupted by the impossible beauty and serenity of Engaku-ji\u2019s zen\
  \ temple garden. Here in Kamakura, you instinctively spoke in hushed tones, slowed\
  \ down your gait, marveled at nature\u2019s beauty and stopped to hear - the flow\
  \ of the water in the streams, the rustle of silk kimonos in motion, the sound of\
  \ the wind against thatched roofs. Serendipitously, I even witnessed a traditional\
  \ Japanese wedding ceremony unfold under the red pillars of Tsurugaoka Hachimangu\
  \ shrine. Now here I was, lost, my phone\u2019s GPS on the blitz, not a care in\
  \ the world.   \n\nI approached the only other souls in view, two friendly-looking\
  \ locals. \u201CExcuse me, this way to H\u014Dkoku-ji Temple?\u201D Blank stares.\
  \ \u201DThe bamboo temple?\u201D I tried again, miming tree shapes. A Japanese flurried\
  \ exchange between them, a reassuring nod, and we were on our way. Years of charades\
  \ had served me well - we were all headed to the same place.\n\nAs our walk pushed\
  \ on under the sweltering sun, the younger and more daring of my new companions\
  \ turned towards me and struck up a conversation. Interested, but unable to understand\
  \ one another, we struggled, until inspiration hit. Soon we were \u201Ctalking\u201D\
  \ fluently - typing furiously on our phones, hitting translate, and sharing our\
  \ screens. A raised eyebrow or furrowed brow quickly indicated when the message\
  \ wasn\u2019t what was intended. We giggled at the misunderstandings, supplemented\
  \ with gestures, and soon the three of us were inseparable.\n\nOur small talk had\
  \ started simple and innocent - how old are you, what do you do for a living, what\
  \ brings you to Japan? But as the day progressed, our questions grew more intimate;\
  \ our answers, more candid. I wish I had pursued a different career. I\u2019m not\
  \ sure I can meet my parents\u2019 expectations. I don\u2019t know if I believe\
  \ in love. Cultures apart, here we had found a perfect middle-ground for exploration.\
  \ Steeped in curiosity and released from judgment, here we were free. \n\nSeeing\
  \ their energy change as we enter a shrine or temple, I feel the weight and importance\
  \ of these sacred places. We walk on the sides of the path to the shrines as only\
  \ the gods walk in the middle, purify ourselves at the ch\u014Dzuya by washing our\
  \ hands left before right, they translate my omikuji fortunes, and I watch with\
  \ wonder as they bow and ring bells with beautiful reverence. Though I do not fully\
  \ understand their delicate deliberate choreography, through their actions I gain\
  \ a touching glimpse - privileged access into another culture.\n\nBellies full of\
  \ murasaki imo ice cream, feet exhausted from endless steps, hearts filled with\
  \ laughter, we eventually find ourselves back at the train station. That moment\
  \ when you linger too long, hug too tight, tear-up unexpectedly? It strikes us.\
  \ Hard. The words flow slowly in our translations now. The pauses long, as we struggle\
  \ to express the sadness and confusion at having to say goodbye. It was only a shared\
  \ afternoon, and yet we part ways as if leaving close family, looking back longingly\
  \ until the very last moment. \n\nThey are my Kamakura family. My Japanese sisters.\
  \ They are the reason I speak to strangers and the reason I\u2019d encourage you\
  \ to as well - because you never know where you\u2019ll meet kindred spirits. Mine\
  \ span the globe, new connections forming and deepening every day."
