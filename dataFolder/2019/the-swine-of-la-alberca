Text: "As I walked around the cathedral in the middle of La Alberca, a sleepy little\
  \ village in Western Spain, I had to remind myself that I was not dreaming. I was\
  \ part of a group of English speakers who had traveled to Spain to help non-English\
  \ speakers have a week of immersive language training. The scenery was absolutely\
  \ idyllic at the resort we were staying at and narrow cobblestone streets lined\
  \ with wildflowers had led the way to the Church of La Asuncion for a field trip\
  \ of sorts. When we finished our tour of the building, we walked out and the morning\
  \ summer sun shone so brightly, making the church gleam. Our group began to make\
  \ our way back to the Plaza Mayor at the center of the village and as we did, we\
  \ passed a large concrete statue of a pig. Our guide then told us that this particular\
  \ statue was in honor of the pig of San Anton. Legend had it that every July the\
  \ villagers of La Alberca would release a pig into the city, and it was everyone\u2019\
  s job to take care of it. If the pig showed up on your doorstep, you were to feed\
  \ it and if it was nighttime, you had to give it a place to stay. As the little\
  \ piglet grew fatter and the nights grew colder, the town would have a festival\
  \ celebrating Saint Anthony or San Anton and they wouldn\u2019t have to feed the\
  \ pig anymore... It would feed them! The whole thing sounded preposterous to me.\
  \ How could the villagers just eat this creature that they had essentially made\
  \ their pet? As we walked away, our guide lamented the fact that we were there in\
  \ June so there was no way we would be able to see the pig strolling around town\
  \ and I was glad I wouldn\u2019t have to look the pig in the eyes knowing how his\
  \ story would end. \nWe made it back to the plaza and our guide set us free so we\
  \ could explore the town for ourselves. I stood quietly, trying to soak in the peacefulness\
  \ of that quaint little town and come up with a plan for how I should spend my free\
  \ time when I heard a very strange sound behind me. It was a kind of a shuffling\
  \ and then there was sniffing and finally, there was a definite snort. I slowly\
  \ turned around and found myself staring down the snout of a dark gray pig. He wasn\u2019\
  t too big, but he wasn\u2019t too small either. He was sniffing amongst the tables\
  \ and chairs of the outdoor caf\xE9 I was standing beside, and he could have cared\
  \ less about me. I didn\u2019t want to frighten him away though, so I carefully\
  \ reached in my bag to grab my camera and whispered to get my friends\u2019 attention\
  \ as they waited in line at the caf\xE9. Despite my attempts to not draw too much\
  \ attention to my new friend, soon everyone from our group had noticed him and started\
  \ to crowd around to get a closer look. He eventually meandered away when he realized\
  \ there weren\u2019t any crumbs to be found in the area and continued his search\
  \ for his next meal elsewhere, obviously totally unaware of his celebrity status.\
  \ And while I knew we had travelled to the pork producing capital of Spain and I\
  \ was prepared to see all kinds of pork products, I wasn\u2019t quite ready for\
  \ an actual living breathing pig, especially now that I knew his eventual fate.\
  \ I can only hope he got wise to the village\u2019s plot against him and staged\
  \ some sort of hunger strike in order to keep from becoming the portly pig everyone\
  \ wanted him to be. If we wouldn\u2019t have seen the pig roaming about when we\
  \ came back to the village a few days later, I might have believed that it was all\
  \ just a dream."
