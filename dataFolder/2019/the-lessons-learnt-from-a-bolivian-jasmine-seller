Text: "I first saw the colourful Bolivian Jasmine sellers on a cool spring evening,\
  \ strategically positioned to attract commuters existing the Subte, as the Buenos\
  \ Aires subway is called. The misty rain that had been falling for most of the day\
  \ having finally stopped gave the family an opportunity to go to sell their flowers.\
  \ Grandma, mum, little girl were at their work of selling with determination but\
  \ it was the six month old baby boy that caught my attention on that damp BA evening.\
  \ Wrapped warmly in his vibrant Bolivian blanket, strands of black hair sneaking\
  \ out from under the traditional bonnet and a happy little smile on his face, he\
  \ sat snuggly in a cardboard fruit box. I couldn\u2019t help myself, the photo opportunity\
  \ was too good. However, just at the precise moment I pulled my phone out of my\
  \ bag the grandmother reached into the box, took the baby out, placed him on her\
  \ knee and stared with an unflinching gaze directly into my eyes. \_Disappointed\
  \ I turned and walked down the Avenida in the direction of my apartment.\n\nWhen\
  \ I saw the same family, minus the grandma only a couple of blocks from my house\
  \ the opportunity to get the shot I had so desired a few weeks previous was exciting.\
  \ The sun was shining, the air was clear and life was good. I took the first photo\
  \ with ease but felt I could do better, so I walked half way across the road all\
  \ the while preparing for the next shot. That\u2019s why I did see the granny until\
  \ she came came barreling around the corner, screaming at me in a great rage. My\
  \ feeble attempts to apologise fell on deaf ears, there was definitely no placating\
  \ her with my limited Spanish. All I could do was turn and walk away, all the while\
  \ grandma still ranted after me.\n\nI have no idea why she objected, it could have\
  \ been any number of things; fear of the authorities as there had been a crackdown\
  \ on street sellers in the weeks leading up to that day or maybe fear that the baby\
  \ would be considered at risk. Really though it didn\u2019t matter what the reason\
  \ was or how picture perfect I considered the scene to be. It wasn\u2019t just a\
  \ photo op for them, it was their life and that was hard enough without worrying\
  \ about some foreigner taking photographs of them or worse causing problems for\
  \ them that they couldn\u2019t fix.  In a land where welfare support is virtually\
  \ non existent you do what you have to, it\u2019s all about survival. The number\
  \ of people estimated to be living below the poverty line Buenos Aires is approximately\
  \ 20% of the population. With another  20% considered vulnerable should prices increase\
  \ or the bread winner unable to work. Considering the inflation rate for 2018 was\
  \ 40%  that could be sooner rather than later.\n\nI have seen the Bolivian Jasmine\
  \ sellers at the end of my street on a number of occasions since that day. The baby\
  \ now has his own pram and looks just as cute as he did in the box. My guess is\
  \ that the main concern of the granny was indeed the baby all the time. I even think\
  \ that on the very first occasion I noticed them, she had also noticed my attempts\
  \ to get my phone out to take the photo. Her eyes had said it all as she stared\
  \ unflinching back at me. This fellow resident of our planet and her family were\
  \ not a tourist attraction for me to take photos of and post on my Social Media\
  \ page. I have no doubt that whatever threat comes along this fierce little woman\
  \ would fight \u201Cfor tooth and nail\u201D to protect her family. While I didn\u2019\
  t actually meet her, the Bolivian jasmine seller helped me learn a lot about about\
  \ respect for the rights of others and I am very grateful for the humility she taught\
  \ me."
