Text: "My dream come true when arrive to my solo travel for Japan to visit FUJI Q\
  \ HIGHLAND, the roller coaster most amazing park with the most dangerous roller\
  \ coaster, it was a great day, but the problems start to come when I`m realize that\
  \ the last bus/train to tokio (this park its three hours away to Tokio) was to 9:00\
  \ pm, and I spend procrastinating time, after the 9:00 pm because I thought it could\
  \ be bus until the 12:00 am. So the ladies in the bus station tell me there\xB4\
  s another trains to a city near to Tokio, so I walk to the another station with\
  \ that train, but my cellphone was discharged, so I ask for help to a japanese boy\
  \ and he gave me his cellphone but it was so complicated because his cell alphabet\
  \ was in kanji, but suddenly I saw an occidental face, so I going with him and was\
  \ a canadian boy making an exchange in japan with his best 50% filipino 50% japanese\
  \ friend, so we become \xA8friends with the same problem\xA8because they after the\
  \ park spend the time in an onsen and they lost the notion of time and forget take\
  \ the bus. So I decide with my new two friends going to that little town supposedly\
  \ near of tokio and sleep in a Mcdonald's but when we arrive to the little town,\
  \ there's nos Mcdonald and we deciden buy food and bear in an Lawson and sleep in\
  \ the street until the 5:00 am come to take the first train to tokio, but a magic\
  \ angel appear in her car asking what occurs with us drift around to the lawson,\
  \ and our filipino friend for his half descendant japanese could make a perfect\
  \ conversation with the girl and make an explanation about our problem. So the girl\
  \ offer to take us to Tokio, the two gays feels ashamed because they know that Tokio\
  \ was in an long distance, but I felt a little scared because I'm mexican and like\
  \ mexican normally we are educated to be afraid to strangers sometimes and more\
  \ in the middle of the night, but I'm decided to trust and my two new friend's in\
  \ remove the shame. So the girl take us to token in a 2 hours trip and she leave\
  \ us very near to the start of the city, but doesn't still near connection to Roppongi\
  \ area(the place that I stayed in Tokio), it was 3:00 am and we decided sleep or\
  \ rest the nest hours until 5:00 am for take the first train in an ciber-cafe(the\
  \ ciber cafes are little cubicles with a computer, share bathroom, and free beverages;\
  \ but there ciber-cafe was only for woman's, so my friends disappear i don't know\
  \ where to find another ciber-cafe for mens for recommendation to find it for the\
  \ receptionist of my ciber-cafe so I spend the last two house trying to rest there\
  \ and when the 5:00 am arrive I take the first train making a kind of walk of shame\
  \ to arrive to Roppongi. It was an inconience very funny and I make new friends."
