Text: "Who inspires to you? What makes you happy?\nThose are questions that recently\
  \ were in my mind and finally I got this: I am a passionate traveler who loves discovering\
  \ new cultures, people, places and flavors and I want to inspire you to discover\
  \ and enjoy the world because you only have once chance to live. I want to be an\
  \ ambassador of my country to show everybody that Colombia have hard workers, happy,\
  \ kind and brave people who have overcome many obstacles but now we are ready to\
  \ be better tan yesterday.\nFor this dream, I promise myself to know my own country\
  \ to discover what makes us unique and great. In the middle of my travel plans I\
  \ found out a sale to visit \u201CLa Guajira\u201D so, I took the opportunity and\
  \ I finally visited the northest part of south america.\nI started my trip visiting\
  \ \"Palomino Beach\" and I loved whatching the strong sea who mixes its water with\
  \ the Palomino River and let me have so much fun connecting me with the water and\
  \ the magicals sunset that surprised me every day. My next stop in my trip was:\
  \ Riohacha, the main City of \"La Guajira\" and I could discover more about the\
  \ Wayuu Culture (an indigen community of this region), I walked around the pier\
  \ seeing the \"mochilas\" handmade by this community and I listened \"Vallenato\"\
  , the popular music of this region of Colombia. Walking around Riohacha I saw many\
  \ toys with the shape of pink Flamingos and I discovered that they are characteristic\
  \ in some towns of this region, then my next destination should be: \"camarones\"\
  .\nTo find out this Flamingos was a complete journey because the lagoon was dry,\
  \ then I had to across the desert by motorcycle to find oud another lagoon where\
  \ this beautiful animals go to eat and rest during the afternoon, but I finally\
  \ saw this magical moment: many pink Flamingos Flying around me and staying over\
  \ the lagoon looking for any to eat and in front of this I had the opportunnity\
  \ to see another magical sunset. Maybe the best sunset that I saw over there was\
  \ the day that I arrived to the \u201CCabo de la Vela\u201D, as a sunsets collector\
  \ I was lucky to see the sky transform from blue, to yellow and red color as a painting\
  \ of fire in the sky. This was so magic!\n\nI could be telling you what I lived\
  \ day by day in this paradise, but what I want is invite you to open your mind to\
  \ new possibilities. I went to this Region to understand how they are and live and\
  \ I found out a natural Paradise full of hardworkers and talented artisans who still\
  \ try to preserve their traditions. Before this trip I thought that going to a desert\
  \ was not a good idea and now I want to come back again because the view is so magic\
  \ that you will be in love as far as you arrive. Just imagine a desertic Region\
  \ who makes you happy with its landscape formed by the gold sand, emerald sea and\
  \ blue sky all the day. And if this was not enought, imagine that the sun says goodbye\
  \ with beautiful and colorful sunsets day by day, Can you imagine this?. Yes, It\
  \ is possible!\nEvery town or city that I visited in this Region had great landscapes,\
  \ I discovered that this Regions of my country is an spectacular Sunsets machine\
  \ and its citizens are lucky to have been born in the in the middle of that paradise,\
  \ but many of them don\xB4t feel like that because of the poverty of the region.\
  \ I invite to you to visit this magical paradise who has been forgotten by the government\
  \ of my country, they need that we visit them and help them to recognized how lucky\
  \ they are to be over there and help them to take care of their beaches, streets\
  \ and sea because the garbage is surrounding the towns and cities, maybe because\
  \ by now the don\xB4t recognize how important is to take care of the environment\
  \ that they have."
