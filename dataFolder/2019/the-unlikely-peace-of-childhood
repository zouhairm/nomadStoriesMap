Text: "Trees whooshing, cows grazing, and the sounds of a temple bell.\nThe familiar\
  \ yet strange sounds and sights brought back memories of my childhood.\nBorn in\
  \ a middle-class family, with my father the sole bread earned and mom taking care\
  \ of two kids and her own frail mother, opportunities for travel were few and far\
  \ in between.\nWhen summer rolled in, the dust, heat, sweat cocktail was ignored\
  \ for a run around the building society grounds and hotter evenings spent reading\
  \ from my small pile of books. For my father, it meant packing up almost half our\
  \ house and taking us on a crowded ten-hour train ride to our native place, his\
  \ childhood home. This was where we spent every summer of my growing years.\nNo\
  \ matter how many times my sister got a perfect score in her exams and I got the\
  \ requisite one mark over passing, my father never changed his summer plans.\nWe\
  \ were to breathe in the fresh air, walk around the omnipresent cows, look at the\
  \ rolling mountains in wonder, hear the disjointed and rambling stories of the past\
  \ from my grandmother and eat seafood mixed, fried or boiled in variations of coconut\
  \ preps four times a day.\nThe times my sister was too occupied to drag me off on\
  \ some adventure that involved some locals and cows, I would escape into a room\
  \ high up in the house. Hunched between rice sacks and sneezing at the growing mound\
  \ of dried red chilies my grandfather grew on his farm, I would sit strategically\
  \ so the shaft of sunlight entering through a small triangle window would fall on\
  \ the book in my hands. Squinting, sneezing, I sighed, reading of grand adventures\
  \ of world\u2019s entered through cupboard doors, murders on moors and ghosts with\
  \ death gardens.\nI tried every cupboard and rabbit hole, but to my intense disappointment,\
  \ even though the house and place were as perfect as the book settings, nothing\
  \ grand happened. Not even a tiny murder, my twelve-year-old thought.\nThen we would\
  \ pack up again and make the train ride back to the city, where the dust would be\
  \ now wet with unpredictable Mumbai rains. Unlike the pristine landscape of South\
  \ India, seasons, summers raced by, more exams I passed by a couple of marks. Our\
  \ trips became a few to once in two-three years. My parents made the trip more often\
  \ we did, and we happily stayed behind, far away from the moos and coconuts. \n\
  After two years of working full time, my mother finally convinced me to take the\
  \ trip south. Dragging my feet, wondering if the dung smell would stay on my clothes\
  \ again and rocking to sleep on the train, my first step was surreal. \nI imagined\
  \ my lungs weeping with gratitude as they filled up with fresh oxygen. Is this what\
  \ I had missed? That night I slept like a newborn after nearly half a decade. \n\
  The next morning we went on a walk, bounced stones on the river and ate a ton of\
  \ fish in coconut gravy. And then it all melted away.  I was breathing again. When\
  \ my dad gave me a knowing smile, it hit me. I had traveled to other places after\
  \ college. I was working and building a tiny nest of savings, not for the rainy\
  \ days but for a big trip, somewhere different. But it took a toll.  Days of commuting\
  \ every day for four hours, the drama of situations, and people talking around me.\
  \ I felt lighter.\nThat last week, I learned how to debone and marinate seafood,\
  \ sit on a village meeting and watch people who had problems I couldn\u2019t even\
  \ imagine experiencing every day. The simplicity of moments and the place warmed\
  \ parts of my being that I had long thought had gone to a corner to sit and be sad.\
  \    \nI came back home, and slept on my bed, thinking of that week like fireflies\
  \ in the summer.  On the train to work, the sound of everything banging in my ears,\
  \ I could imagine the soft sun on my face and the sound of those trees whooshing.\
  \ I found peace in the unlikeliest places."
