Text: "How penniless me, with a vague knowledge of Portuguese, managed to find myself\
  \ living in the midst of one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s favelas named Pavon, exhilarates\
  \ and excites me down to my core. Situated between Copacabana and Ipanema beach,\
  \ built on the wall of the mountain, together with views of the sea, some may call\
  \ this paradise. However, behind the tourist appeal with golden beaches and spectacular\
  \ lush scenery, there\u2019s a civil war going on. \n\nThe warm sun had again risen,\
  \ promising a new day with heat and humidity. The sunshine spreads throughout the\
  \ lively city, ranging from fancy flats to illegal infrastructures with many bullet\
  \ holes, the latter mostly found within Rio\u2019s many various favelas. Meanwhile,\
  \ I'm enjoying the last bit of my black Colombian coffee, leaning on the edge of\
  \ the blue painted veranda while looking out over the hundreds of old brick buildings\
  \ below me. Many painted in any colour of the rainbow, small alleyways hiding everywhere,\
  \ and a maze of electrical wires connecting the houses together. Everyone is living\
  \ on top of each other, with no room for privacy since most homes are barely spaced\
  \ a meter apart. Kids are playing with their kites from the rooftops, old ladies\
  \ sweeping away, and some teenage groups are still up after yesterday's wild Baile\
  \ Funk party, usually held in the middle of the favela with its ridiculously loud\
  \ music.\n\nIn my crochet net I pack my daily belongings, and due to previous advice,\
  \ I place my phone down the front of my pants. Today I\u2019m heading for the beach\
  \ to meet up with some of the locals who sell anything from Brazil's iconic drink\
  \ Caipirinha to bikinis of all sorts, and delicious coal grilled halloumi cheese\
  \ made with your pick of spices.\n\nAs I walk down the tight stairways and through\
  \ the narrow alleyways of the neighbourhood, the cheerful music of Samba is getting\
  \ louder. It\u2019s Saturday morning, and we\u2019re a week away from the start\
  \ of the carnival, the streets are filled with life as always, but now Samba is\
  \ being played everywhere, and what a joy it is to see people of all ages with big\
  \ smiles on their faces, shaking their booty to these incredible rhythms. I reach\
  \ the first little street, saying my most confident hello\u2019s, \u201Cbom dia\u201D\
  \ to the guards armed with machine guns who wouldn\u2019t even have reached the\
  \ age of eighteen yet. I\u2019m met by running cheerful children who\u2019d all\
  \ been playing with the water from the shower, placed next to the little local convenience\
  \ shop. A football is being kicked around, and some girls with their beautiful afro\
  \ braided hair are dancing and laughing with eyes filled with life. The street is\
  \ decorated with colourful banners, there\u2019s meat being cooked on a barbecue,\
  \ and some tables and chairs are placed next to several drums and other musical\
  \ instruments. Some people are wearing costumes, and there\u2019s plenty of sparkling\
  \ glitter all around the place. I keep greeting the locals as I continue my walk,\
  \ carefully placing my steps on the steeply uneven, broken cement street, passing\
  \ fruit stalls, barbers, car repairs and people searching through the many piles\
  \ of rubbish. Above passing stairways, drugs are being sold by the local gang who\
  \ run this favela, having children as young as eight working to protect their territory,\
  \ some armed with guns and they all seem to smoke.\n\nWhen I reach the bottom of\
  \ the hill, which means the end and the beginning of the favela, several motorbikes\
  \ locally called moto-taxis are all lined up. Except for an old Volkswagen, used\
  \ as a minibus, these can be your only chance for a lift up the mountain for no\
  \ more than three Reales. Beside them stand the police around the clock, but they\
  \ rarely enter and the taxis won\u2019t even take you up.\n\nStrange looks come\
  \ my way from the people below, some filled with confusion, apparently wondering\
  \ why a white girl with blond hair is wandering these parts of the city. But, my\
  \ genuine smile is a reflection of the judgements, happiness can be found everywhere,\
  \ and I have learned that some of the most unique people live within these hills."
