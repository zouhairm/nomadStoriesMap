Text: "Budapest was different, it was almost like a dream that I didn\u2019t want\
  \ to be awakened from. The sun was just about to set, and the orange-yellow hues\
  \ of light projected on to the busy city and lit the ancient architecture of the\
  \ buildings that were juxtaposed by the bright mustard yellow trams that dissected\
  \ through the narrow streets of Budapest. The mighty river Dunabe flowed and brought\
  \ together the two great masses of land pitted against each other, Buda and Pest.\
  \ I visited this magical place as a solo traveler, perhaps this amplified the grandiose\
  \ of the city.\nThe parliament fa\xE7ade was grand, a big exterior that was imposing\
  \ but beautiful nonetheless. I hadn\u2019t heard much of the city, it was only till\
  \ I arrived did I find out of the vastness of this upbeat metropolis. The tourists\
  \ flooded the streets and congregated at famous monuments, museums, and attractions.\
  \ The weather was mildly pleasant, it was mid-February, just around the time the\
  \ spring is conflicted about whether or not to begin. I didn\u2019t particularly\
  \ have a prior itinerary planned, but, all I knew was I was exactly where I was\
  \ meant to be. My heart had been longing for something, I wasn\u2019t particularly\
  \ sure if it wanted questions to ask or demanded answers\u2026all I knew is, that\
  \ same curiosity led me to Budapest, in the Jewish quarter to be exact.\nI took\
  \ one of those bus tours, the red double-decker ones with the open top in an effort\
  \ to see most of the attractions in the shortest time possible. \nThe city was nothing\
  \ like I ever saw before, it had personality, it was confident yet down to earth,\
  \ extravagant yet humble. This was reflected throughout the city, the buildings,\
  \ the culture, the people. Its raw beauty was mesmerizing.\nAfter a long day of\
  \ sightseeing, I returned back to my hostel. Close by was a synagogue, the great\
  \ synagogue. The facade was made of tan and maroon tiles and had ornate decorations\
  \ all around the exterior. Crowds of tourists lined up to see this attraction, however,\
  \ keen on returning back to the hostel, I proceeded with my journey. \nIn the hostel\
  \ lobby, I was welcomed by other solo travelers who sat in a circle as they drank\
  \ mulled wine. We gathered around the table surrounding a pot of the hot beverage\
  \ indulging in conversation. We were all from all over, some from Australia, Taiwan,\
  \ and England. \nI sat next to a woman who told me about her travels, she was from\
  \ Argentina. Throughout the night we conversed about where we're from, why we chose\
  \ to travel\u2026our dreams. The more wine we drank the more the conversation stimulated.\
  \ She had tattoos that covered part of her wrists with which I asked about. It was\
  \ an outline of a heartbeat. \u201Cwhy did you get this?\u2019 I asked. \u201CDo\
  \ you see the way lines go up and down\u2026how the signify breathing, life? Do\
  \ you see it? Well, \u2026it\u2019s a metaphor, without the ups and downs\u2026\
  we would just be dead.\u201D\n Till this day, those same words remain with me\u2026\
  and are one of the few gems I acquired if not the most important, during my time\
  \ in Budapest."
