Text: "The fork and me were in a staring contest. It seemed to float towards my mouth\
  \ against my hands\u2019 better judgement. The silverware seemed to glimmer against\
  \ the white table cloth as I looked down as the fork entered passed my lips. I cringed\
  \ in apprehension as the flavor hit my taste buds. Then my face relaxed and I chewed.\
  \ A symphony of flavor seemed to dance on my tongue as I nodded my head in approval.\
  \ The taste of garlic and some unknown sweet flavor moved around as I swallowed.\
  \ \u201CIt tastes better than I expected\u201D as I eyed the plate of escargot.\
  \ I reached out with my fork and took another snail out of the twisting lines of\
  \ pasta smothered in sauce. My instructor looked at me with a bemused smile as I\
  \ washed the bite down with a sip of my drink. \u201CMost people don\u2019t like\
  \ diving into the unknown, and with escargot it all depends on how it\u2019s cooked.\u201D\
  \ I smile and shake my head \u201CIf I\u2019m in France I\u2019m going to live it\
  \ up like the French and that means especially the food.\u201D The warm summer air\
  \ seems to play in my hair as the sun sets behind me in the little open air caf\xE9\
  . Little pigeons make noises below my table as I breath in the aroma of fresh french\
  \ cuisine around me. The warm sun seems to bring out the sweet scents of bread and\
  \ whatever mysteries are being cooked up in the kitchen. The world seems so much\
  \ simpler here than back home in the United States. The bubbles in my Orangina seem\
  \ to wash away my jet lag as I smile softly against my glass bottle. The carbonated\
  \ orange juice seems to be one of the best things I\u2019ve ever tasted, seeing\
  \ as we can\u2019t get it anywhere in America or else I would have found it sooner.\
  \ French food is truly a leap into the unknown, everything is bound to be good.\
  \ As long as you are willing to try and branch out, you will not be disappointed.\
  \ The people I traveled with on the trip bought nothing but burgers. Let me tell\
  \ you something about the French. They can\u2019t make burgers to save their lives.\
  \ They can cook such fantastic and amazing combinations but when it comes to burgers,\
  \ it\u2019s just not the same. They make chocolate cake with such a loving hand\
  \ it melts on your tongue like whipped cream. They make crepes so light it\u2019\
  s like eating air. They cook duck and mix wine sauces with such care once you eat\
  \ it, you can never go back. \nI believe one of the simplest ways to take a leap\
  \ into the unknown is to try new food. As the great Forest Gump said, \u201CLife\
  \ is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get.\u201D"
