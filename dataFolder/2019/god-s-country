Text: "What could be more exciting than quitting your horrible job to live on the\
  \ opposite side of the world at the invitation of a tall, handsome Spaniard? It\
  \ sounds too good to be true, right? I know. But in 2016 that\u2019s exactly what\
  \ I did. I left my job, my family and friends, to go and start a new life with my\
  \ friend (and crush) Fernando. It\u2019s amazing how, in just one moment, following\
  \ your dreams can turn into a terrible nightmare.\n\nGodella translates to \u2018\
  God\u2019s country\u2019 and the first time I visited was on a tour. Our group had\
  \ formed a tight bond over the two weeks preceding and our guide invited us to his\
  \ rooftop for an authentic Valencian paella. Fernando was the perfect host and taught\
  \ us how to make this historical dish, cooked slowly in a shallow metre-wide pan\
  \ over an open fire. The smoke mixed with the sweet perfume of orange blossoms.\
  \ The clip-clop of horse hooves on cobblestones echoed throughout the narrow lanes\
  \ below us. After a long lunch, and a few jugs of Sangria, we set off for a walking\
  \ tour through the heritage-listed farmland, La Huerta. It was beautiful. Rows of\
  \ tiny garlic heads reflected the pink champagne light of dusk, and the velvety\
  \ grey artichoke bushes squatted side by side. The full moon rose above the fields\
  \ and water burbled beside us as it swirled through the irrigation channels that\
  \ the Arabs had established a thousand years before. I felt an overwhelming sense\
  \ of peace and joy. I vowed to myself, and to Fernando, that one day I would return.\n\
  \nEighteen months after our journey ended, I still wrote to and skyped Fernando\
  \ on a regular basis. My job was literally killing me. I had started work as an\
  \ English teacher. Although I adored working with the students, my new supervisor\
  \ and manager were another matter. I began to collapse up to three times an hour\
  \ with a racing heart. Despite thorough testing, a physical reason could not be\
  \ found. \n\u201CIt\u2019s stress. I am sure. Quit your job, and move to Spain,\u201D\
  \ the cardiologist ordered. \u201CYou need salty food and a life free of stress.\u201D\
  \nWhen I told Fernando, he was delighted. \u201CI\u2019ve had a room waiting for\
  \ you for almost eighteen months. Don\u2019t worry about anything. Whatever you\
  \ need, I will help you. Just come.\u201D\nI had never felt so excited and nervous\
  \ before. I was moving literally to the other side of the world, leaving my modern\
  \ Australian lifestyle to live in a traditional Spanish village, at the invitation\
  \ of a true Prince Charming.\n\nI arrived at the Valencia airport and searched the\
  \ sea of faces for Fernando, but he wasn\u2019t there. It was already dark, but\
  \ I knew how to use the metro and get to his village. I tried to calm myself with\
  \ the confidence that he would never let me down. Maybe he was making a paella on\
  \ the terrace to welcome me? I was sure that was it. Still, I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ the fear that began to rise from my stomach to my chest and throat. As I stepped\
  \ off the metro I took the paper with his address from my pocket and tried to ask\
  \ the way. I went into the closest shop, the hairdresser, and was greeted by a man\
  \ with blue dreadlocks. \n\nHe took the paper and looked me in the eye. \n\u201C\
  Fernando? He\u2019s in the mountains.\u201D\nHe\u2019d gone away? I couldn\u2019\
  t believe my ears. \u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D\n\u201CThere was an accident. He\
  \ is dead.\u201D\nPanic, shock and fear overwhelmed me, as I was taken inside to\
  \ wait for Fernando\u2019s family. I felt dizzy, confused, nauseous. My heart raced.\
  \ I began crying uncontrollably.\n\nFernando\u2019s mother and sister arrived with\
  \ worried, tired faces and took me to his apartment. The grief came in waves. I\
  \ woke up several times during the night with a start, only to find that the nightmare\
  \ was real. When the morning finally came, champagne pink light bathed the room\
  \ and I watched as colour seeped into the green fields beyond and filled the sky.\
  \ I had finally made it to Godella, but I had arrived too late."
