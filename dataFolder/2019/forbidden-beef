Text: "The amphitheater reverberates with cries of \u201COle!\u201D People are on\
  \ their feet. They are waving a white handkerchief, at a prince galloping around\
  \ the arena. I am still sitting. The thick knot in my throat refuses to abate. \n\
  \nA couple of hours ago, I was outside the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas \u2013 a\
  \ bull-ring cloaked as a fortress.\n\nBull-fighting is, the cornerstone of right-wing\
  \ politics in Spain. Although banned in certain parts of the country, it is the\
  \ support of this centuries-old tradition that will influence the outcome of the\
  \ general elections in April 2019. \n\nBlissfully unaware, of all the gory details,\
  \ I take my place on the stony steps that encircle the stadium. The sun has begun\
  \ its descent. Vendors of soda and chips, zig-zag through the trickling audience,\
  \ the bass of their beckoning calls, surprisingly similar, to the ones I have heard\
  \ at other stadiums in other countries.\n\nThe trumpets begin to play, and insinuate\
  \ the impending arrival of royalty. A man gallops into the stadium.  Handsome like\
  \ the devil, with a wolf-like smile to match, he is more prince than king, more\
  \ Reggie than Archie.  The rays of the setting sun, catch on to the silver fern,\
  \ spread out in front of his violet sequined jacket. The audience waves and claps\
  \ at the knight rider. Their rejoneador has arrived.\n\nThe matadors, the bull-fighters\
  \ on foot, in their manoletina shoes and knee length pink socks, spread out in three\
  \ corners of the stadium. \n\nThe unsuspecting knucklehead makes its entrance. The\
  \ crowd falls silent. Its head bobs up and down and the bell around its neck, tinkles\
  \ with its trot.\n\nThe rejoneador swishes his horse in front of the bull. The bull\
  \ takes the bait and charges ahead. The dance of death has begun.  \n\nMinutes later,\
  \ four metal rods, dangle from the back of the bull - pierced into its body by the\
  \ riding horseman. Dark liquid, oozes and streams from its back.\n\nOne of the matadors\
  \ steps forward and produces a garish pink cape. He waves it in front of the bull.\
  \ Notwithstanding its bleeding back and always up for a challenge, the bull charges,\
  \ at the waving piece of cloth, only to find it pulled away, the way a chair is\
  \ pulled away from someone about to sit on it.\n \nThe bull pauses, then sinks on\
  \ its knees and falls sideways with a thud. A matador steps forward. He lifts a\
  \ bejeweled dagger and stabs it into the bull\u2019s head. The pin drop silence\
  \ is broken as a child squeals in horror. The stadium erupts with cries of \u2018\
  \u2019Ole!\u201D  The bull\u2019s body is dragged out of sight by a carriage of\
  \ horses.\n\nThe rejoneador is now galloping around the stadium, his grin wider\
  \ than ever. He makes a mock of wiping off the sweat on his forehead and pats the\
  \ mane of his companion in crime \u2013 the horse. Everyone in the audience, now\
  \ has a white handkerchief in their hands and they wave it at him with cries of\
  \ \u2018\u2019Ole!\u201D \n\nUp until now, bull-fighting has been the story of an\
  \ exotic cult, accessible via glitzy photographs of a leather man in medieval frills\
  \ confronting a bull with nothing more than a bright pink cloth, and of frivolous\
  \ psychobabble about what triggers the bull - is it the color or the movement of\
  \ the cape? Turns out, that witnessing one, is like watching a movie, and had I\
  \ known the ending, I would not have gone to the theater. It is a movie, that I\
  \ watched nine times that night \u2013 nine times - an apparent bid by show-organizers\
  \ to justify the pricey ticket. The display of colors, courage and cruelty in front\
  \ of a cheering crowd is glamorous and appalling at the same time. \n\nIn India,\
  \ the import and export of a bull\u2019s meat is banned. There are certain states\
  \ in the country where it is the story of men, who get mobbed and slaughtered, for\
  \ the mere act of possessing beef. \n\nI catch the expression of the Spaniard standing\
  \ next to me. I retreat slightly, then stand up to smile at the rider. If only there\
  \ was a way, to keep both the tradition and the bull alive."
