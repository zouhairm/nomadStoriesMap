  \ had no idea if that was a lot or a little. \u201CIt\u2019s original. Honda.\u201D\
  \ I didn\u2019t know anything about motorbikes. All I knew was that I hoped this\
  \ one would get us to our destination before collapsing into a pile of steel and\
  \ smoke. When the light turned green, the engine roared with effort. Danh dodged\
  \ faster, newer bikes and made his way around the turn. \u201CIt\u2019s not made\
  \ for two people,\u201D he yelled back at me. Well, I thought, at least it\u2019\
  s an experience I\u2019ll remember\u2014if I make it alive. I grasped what I could\
  \ and thanked him for lending me his helmet.\n\nDanh was twenty. I had met him the\
  \ previous night at a hostel bar in central Hu\u1EBF. I had just finished my first\
  \ semester of college and had wanted to travel alone for a few weeks, using money\
  \ saved from a summer job. As I was drinking a lonely gin and tonic, Danh approached\
  \ and invited me to play a game of pool. He had been studying English for four months\
  \ and wanted some practice. As we played, he nursed a single beer (drinking heavily\
  \ is \u201Csort of an American thing, right?\u201D he opined) and sunk every solid\
  \ before I had hit in three stripes.\n\nThe next morning, he promised to take me\
  \ around the city. When I agreed, I hadn\u2019t known that the method of transport\
  \ would be a rickety scooter with an engine that coughed up thick smoke. \n\nDanh\
  \ slowed down as we approached our destination. It was a ph\u1EDF stand on a backstreet,\
  \ facing a building with five or so young men in green uniforms out front. \u201C\
  Are those soldiers?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201CNational police. We don\u2019t like\
  \ them.\u201D\n\n\u201CNo? Why?\u201D\n\n\u201CThey aren\u2019t fair. You know the\
  \ song \u2018Fuck the Police?\u2019\u201D I laughed. \u201CIt\u2019s like that,\u201D\
  \ he said.\n\nThe lady at the stand twirled thin slices of raw beef in a boiling\
  \ vat of broth. As we slurped, Danh told me that he worked as a graphic designer.\
  \ He earned 6 million dong per month, or about $260\u2014well above the city\u2019\
  s average. Every month, he gave half to his mother. Soon, he hoped to save enough\
  \ to go to the United States and earn a degree.\n\nSome of Danh\u2019s friends came\
  \ and joined us. We took selfie after selfie. I looked so young, they told me. Most\
  \ of the tourists in the city were much older, either single men visiting for nefarious\
  \ reasons or families who stuck to themselves. Danh\u2019s girlfriends wanted to\
  \ tell me all about the importance of the Vietnamese item of clothing called \xE1\
  o d\xE0i, worn by women on special occasions. And Danh kept bringing up Biggie and\
  \ Tupac, people whom, despite my American origin, he clearly knew more about than\
  \ me. \n\nI would fall in love with Vietnam on this trip, but perhaps it was a foregone\
  \ conclusion. Ever since I had watched Anthony Bourdain eat a bowl of clam rice,\
  \ sitting on a plastic stool with the image of speeding motorbikes smeared across\
  \ the city behind him, I had decided that Vietnam was where I wanted to be.\n\n\
  Now, I was sitting on a very similar stool, getting brutally critiqued on my chopsticks\
  \ skills as I lifted the fragrant noodles to my mouth. But I didn\u2019t care\u2014\
  he was perhaps correct that my chopstick skills did need some improving. Danh ate\
  \ his bowl with grace and speed, and he told me that this same lady had served him\
  \ ph\u1EDF since he was a baby. I was happier than ever that I had agreed to join\
  \ him on that deathtrap of a bike. I finished my bowl with much less grace\u2014\
  but almost as much speed.\n\nWhen we got up to leave, Danh insisted on paying. \u201C\
  You deserve it,\u201D he said, smiling. \u201CYou survived all 50 cc\u2019s.\u201D"
