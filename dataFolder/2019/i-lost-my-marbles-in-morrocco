Text: "My first thought on arriving on Morroccan soil \u201C Do they have a McDonalds\
  \ \u201C? . I told myself over and over again that I would venture out of my casual\
  \ American habits but time and time again I resorted back to my roots. I arrived\
  \ in Marrakech at 11pm in search of anything familiar and I found everything but\
  \ , I would then reach my Riad by midnight to find that Morrocco was just as beautiful\
  \ as I had seen in the pictures . Before I headed off to bed I planned out my day\
  \ by eating only Americanized restaurants and seeing tourist hot spots. I don\u2019\
  t want to sound clich\xE9 but I awoke in the morning at 6am by a rooster loudly\
  \ screeching , you can hear the hustle and bustle of the small narrow streets outside\
  \ my riad and life seemed absolutely perfect in that moment . \u201C Wow I\u2019\
  m in Morrocco , I never could have dreamed this \u201C is the first thought I had\
  \ laying in bed . These adventures I have had lately I could have never predicted\
  \ and forever I am grateful for these opportunities . I started the day with a plan\
  \ but ended up doing the complete opposite , I walk out my riad and I am greeted\
  \ by a boy no older than 20 years old . He proceeds to sell me a tour that he can\
  \ give me only for 40 Durham . THE REALITY : $4 of my money for a full day of his\
  \ time ....Let\u2019s do this . As he led me further into Marrakech I discovered\
  \ how lucky I am and how privileged my life really is . The poverty in Morrocco\
  \ is intense to say the least and I never expected to see so many eye opening sights.\
  \ By nightfall we came across the square where the lights , the music and life are\
  \ very loud . We stumbled upon a group of young boys playing marbles for money .\
  \ Now I think to myself how fun must this be for them to experience this everyday\
  \ and how unlucky of me to live in such a shit city like LA. The boys hustle us\
  \ over and proceed to teach me their marble game . 10 Durham , 50 Durham , 100 Durham\
  \ , the farther I go in this game the more I am loosing . One boy says to me \u201C\
  \ you must be so lucky you live in America you can drive a Ferrari everyday \u201C\
  \ . To my knowledge I certainly do not drive a Ferrari everyday but the notion that\
  \ this is what they must think of Americans made me chuckle a bit . In total I lost\
  \ about 25 American dollars but it was absolutely worth it , I learned and saw so\
  \ many things that opened my eyes to a lot of the world that I had no idea exsisted\
  \ . I flew home to LA 3 days later and couldn\u2019t get these crazy thoughts out\
  \ of my head about how stupid we live , how some people can have so little but thrive\
  \ so much I guess you could say I lost my marbles in Marrakech ."
