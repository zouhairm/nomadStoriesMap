Text: "Welcome to Singapore! The most expensive city in the world. Wait a minute,\
  \ is that true? Come with me at the crazy broke Singapore adventure!\nI worked at\
  \ Singapore for certain months and gain experience of working, no, travelling I\
  \ mean (sorry Boss!). If some of you watched a Hollywood movie with title \u2018\
  Crazy Rich Asian\u2019, you must be think that Singapore is all where non-affordable\
  \ stuff around so you will go broke at the day 1 of your travelling. Well yes, especially\
  \ for the accommodation, it is a bit expensive, but other than that it could be\
  \ amazingly cheap or free! Still not believe it?\nI started my solo travelling at\
  \ Haji Lane, here is the street with beautiful wall painting, caf\xE9, cute fashion\
  \ shop that so crowded with tourist, there is no entry free off course, just paid\
  \ the MRT/Bus fare. Only need small walk to go to other destination called Arab\
  \ street that also free, where I could find Sultan mosque and many Arab shop and\
  \ restaurant. There is so many non Singaporean live in Singapore, almost half of\
  \ Singapore citizen consist of non Singaporean, which bring variety of diversity,\
  \ there is Chinatown, little India, Arab street that you can found with really really\
  \ Chineese people, India people, Arabian people living there. I am taking lunch\
  \ at Kampong Glam at the Arab street, you could buy dring with less than 2 dollars\
  \ and food at around 3-6$.\nAfter do hundred of selfie at Haji Lane and Arab street,\
  \ I go to Esplanade, it was an art building with durian shape, where you also can\
  \ watch free music show etc. Only need small walk, you could find the Merlion Park,\
  \ the lion statue with fountain from its mouth. People going there and usually take\
  \ an open mouth picture as if they drink the water fountain, don\u2019t be surprised!\
  \ Both of Esplanade and Merlion Park are free entry.\nTaking walk or taxi go to\
  \ Marina Bay Sands Mall to stroll around the Mall, all expensive brand are there\
  \ for you to buy or only taking the picture as if you buy it. Why I am going there?\
  \ So, there is 2 show, I mean free show that I will watch near there, first is at\
  \ 8 pm, it was an incredible free show of laser, music, and fountain that might\
  \ made you cried while hearing the music, or when you remember how people could\
  \ get this as free show. The show called SPECTRA, and showed at the Singapore river\
  \ with the perfect spot to show is either you sit down at the MBS plaza which is\
  \ free or ride a river cruise which is cost more than 30 dollars.\nRun a little\
  \ bit to the next show at 8.45 pm to the Garden by the bay, here we go to the next\
  \ free show. If you watch the Crazy Rich Asian movies, at the wedding event, they\
  \ are doing it at the Garden by the bay, now here we go the Crazy Broke show with\
  \ 0 dollars needed. I got the show of big tree with music like opera and light show,\
  \ very amazing show. I also could take perfect picture of Marina Bays Sands, the\
  \ expensive hotel Singapore which is very iconic of Singapore.\nBus and MRT at Singapore\
  \ cost you 1-2 dollard per travel, and for food you could found 3-7 dollars for\
  \ budget food, and shopping? At the next day, I go for shopping day. I go to my\
  \ favorite mall ever at Lucky plaza, if you know Orchard road that is very famous\
  \ with branded stuff, this mall is only just in front of ION Orchard Mall. It was\
  \ a philipine mall with many Singapore gifts and cheap but cute clothes that will\
  \ make you shout \u2018Oh-My-God!\u2019. I go to the lower floor for Singapore gifts,\
  \ chocolate and clothes in the highest floor. Do you believe me that I buy branded\
  \ new dress for 2 dollars price, moreover it is Singapore?\nWell, that\u2019s so\
  \ many other destination like Sentosa Island, don\u2019t even think about the expensive\
  \ of Universal, no, not that, all free show, free water boom, and other are waited\
  \ at this beauty Singapore!"
