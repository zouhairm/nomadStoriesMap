Text: "We arrived in late afternoon, in good standing to savor some rooftop reverie\
  \ at sunset. Traffic in the post-colonial town of narrow cobblestone hills gives\
  \ charm to the concept of gridlock. Doorways are adorned with garlands of cempas\xFA\
  chil, the indigenous word for marigold, the golden hue representative of lights\
  \ to guide the spirits on their way home. Rustic buildings reveal open courtyards\
  \ converted to welcoming caf\xE9s, cavernous galleries of artisan wares, or homes\
  \ of locals making visible their altars piled with treasures for the dead. Women\
  \ have staged tables in the streets for the customary face painting, handmade flower\
  \ tiaras and the lo-down on how to celebrate, San Miguel de Allende style, renown\
  \ for its observance of the iconic Mexican holiday: Day of the Dead. \n\nIt is actually\
  \ 2 days, November 1st for the children, los ni\xF1os, and November 2nd, para los\
  \ adultos. With Halloween tacked on the front-end and the weekend on the back, we\u2019\
  re talking about a week long take-over of the town. Locals and tourists alike crowd\
  \ the zocalo, some in complete skeletal costume, others mimicking gilded stars from\
  \ beyond the grave, the likes of Maria Felix or the ever enduring, Frida Kahlo.\
  \ Kids in the square are trick \u2018o treating. The scene is set with bold colors,\
  \ traditional music, scrumptious food, folkloric art and loud, bright life: an antithetical\
  \ overture to that of death.\n\nOur cramped ride to San Miguel de Allende from M\xE9\
  xico City was a needed respite. We had our fill of the burgeoning tension in CDMX\
  \ with the menace of Mega Corte. It was Halloween and The Big Cut, was to commence\
  \ that day, in which water was to be shut off to most of the residents. This was\
  \ on the eve of Dia de Los Muertos, one of the most significant holidays in all\
  \ of M\xE9xico. Decaying pipes begged for restoration. Water was being wasted. The\
  \ timing seemed like madness to me, but truly was there ever a good time to shut\
  \ off the water? Agua, a resource most essential to living, second only to air.\
  \ The juxtaposition of Mega Corte during Dia de Los Muertos illustrated the life/death\
  \ paradox most succinctly.\n\nThis was a return visit to San Miguel for me. I had\
  \ been once before in the summer of 2005. Even though I was coming  back in 2018,\
  \ an immeasurably changed woman, I was counting on San Miguel not having changed\
  \ that much at all. Some of that held steadfast, like the beacon that is La Parroquia,\
  \ the only gothic cathedral in all of M\xE9xico. When feeling disoriented in the\
  \ obtuse and endless streets, one only needs to look up to get their bearings. La\
  \ Parroquia acts as a compass of sorts, differentiating north from south by the\
  \ angle at which you glimpse her. La Parroquia is spectacularly lit at night, twinkling\
  \ like a castle from your favorite fairytale. She is a constant. The maze of colonial\
  \ buildings also. They are still there, dug in, even receiving UNESCO World Heritage\
  \ Site status in 2008. And then there are some less desirable aspects. \n\nIs San\
  \ Miguel overexposed? Possibly. Do I love it anyway? But of course. I chose to visit\
  \ during one of the most heightened tourism weeks of the year. So yeah, there was\
  \ a lot more stimulus, not all of it authentic. I also noticed more swanky spots,\
  \ an indicator that more wealth has landed. And still I possess unyielding enchantment.\
  \ As we walked the bustling streets, I had to temper my accelerated heart rate as\
  \ I reveled in wonder. I spied into shops and galleries, all of them showcasing\
  \ collections of beautiful things that I craved. I found myself retracing my steps\
  \ from 2005, in search of a familiar boutique, now gone, or perhaps the exact coordinates\
  \ of which are fuzzy in my memory. It had been 13 years after all. I was in search\
  \ of a replacement pair of traditional filigree earrings. Eventually my quest proved\
  \ fruitful, also a testament to some things staying the same. Delighted, I couldn\u2019\
  t wait to don the golden tin trinkets. A connection to my younger self, reinvented\
  \ with age and perspective. Gracias a San Miguel."
