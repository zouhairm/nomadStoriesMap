Text: "The month I spent in Senegal can be summed up in three words: tradition, hospitality\
  \ and tea. But if you have experienced Senegal, you'll know these three words have\
  \ the same meaning, which is \"teranga\".\n\nI went to Senegal as a volunteer to\
  \ give the only thing I could offer as a student: my time. But, without a doubt,\
  \ I returned having received much more than what I offered.\n\nThere are very few\
  \ things I could say that didn't surprise me of Senegal. The landscape, the cars,\
  \ the houses... but above all, the people. The Senegalese have the power to captivate\
  \ you from the first minute you step a foot on their land. To make you feel part\
  \ of their community and their family.\n\nAnd that's how I felt. Another sister\
  \ of a teenager who barely spoke Spanish, shy at first but that on the second day\
  \ she already took me by the arm and hugged me saying \"Tu es ma soeur. My sister\"\
  . Another daughter of that lady who welcomed me into her house without knowing anything\
  \ about me and always gave me the best part of the fish. Another Senegalese walking\
  \ through its streets greeting whoever I found and playing with the children at\
  \ the sound of \"toubab\" (caucasic in Wolof, local and national language).\n\n\
  All the people who have lived Senegal - and I say lived because this country can\
  \ be visited without living it - have witnessed the Senegalese teranga. Teranga\
  \ means hospitality and they do not lack that. Hospitality is personified in every\
  \ corner of the country: the greetings repeated in the streets of sand of Mbour,\
  \ greetings that start being in French - official language of the country - but\
  \ that after 3 days you let yourself go and do it in Wolof. \"Salaam aleikoum. Nanga\
  \ def? \"(Hello, how are you?).\n\nBut the teranga is also present with the famous\
  \ ceremony of tea, an excuse to meet friends to hang out and chat. Take for granted\
  \ that if you just meet a Senegalese and they like you, the next day you will be\
  \ having tea at their home. It is a sincere welcome and can be found in all the\
  \ towns of the country. These are values \u200B\u200Bthat when you go back home,\
  \ you really miss them.\n\nSenegal engages. Its colors, its landscapes, its monuments,\
  \ its beaches. But above all, it engages its people."
