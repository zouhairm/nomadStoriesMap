Text: "It was nearing 10 pm and I found myself on the cobblestone streets on Paris\u2019\
  \ Saint Germain neighborhood, weary from a four-hour self-guided exploration of\
  \ the Louvre (punctuated by three \u201CBordeaux\u201D breaks), streetlights reflecting\
  \ off of the damp, December ground. I stood on the sidewalk avoiding eye contact\
  \ with passers-by, as my aunt and uncle bickered about the restaurant \u2013 was\
  \ the lighting too bright? It couldn\u2019t be any good with that practically fluorescent\
  \ light. We\u2019re tourists in Paris, but we aren\u2019t those kinds of tourists;\
  \ we should eat where les parisiens eat. I bet the menus come in five languages.\
  \ Well she didn\u2019t want to be one of those tourists either, but she was starving.\
  \ And it was raining. \nI was secretly (silently) with her, but kept my mouth shut.\
  \ I was merely tagging along for their four days in Paris, before we all continued\
  \ on to spend Christmas in London with the rest of our family. Hunger won out in\
  \ the end, and I led the way into the \u201Ctourist trap,\u201D where I am immediately\
  \ confronted face-first by an older, French gentleman, loudly exclaiming \u201C\
  I know you? I know you!\u201D Speechless, and admittedly a little afraid, I turned\
  \ back to my aunt and uncle in the doorway behind me for help and realization dawned\
  \ on all four of us at once. \n\nCut to three night prior, our first together in\
  \ Paris: we three arrive at a small art gallery in Saint Germain after regular hours.\
  \ Sonya, a friend of theirs from New York had given them the gallery details where\
  \ her work was to be exhibited through December 2011 \u2013 beautiful Manhattan\
  \ cityscapes and landscapes. Because it\u2019s after hours, we peer into the window\
  \ and are met with a scene no one was quite prepared for: a group of eight or so\
  \ men dressed in black, very seriously examining the current show of large, loft-sized\
  \ erotic photos (all black and white). Disappointed, and a bit taken aback, we are\
  \ about to turn away when another man entered from stage right, hefting one of Sonya\u2019\
  s paintings in front of a large female backside \u2013 the view south from Houston\
  \ on Lafayette. \n\nIt\u2019s at that moment that we\u2019re caught by the gallery\
  \ assistant; three people spying from the outside, one attempting to take a flash\
  \ photograph. Though once they discover that we\u2019re \u201Cun amie d\u2019artiste,\u201D\
  \ we\u2019re not only welcomed with open arms, but immediately put to work by the\
  \ gallery owner, Laurent. It turns out the crowd in the gallery are two separate\
  \ group: several middle-aged Russian men, and a French couple, all in the market.\
  \ With friends of the artist now in the room, Laurent found Sonya\u2019s four remaining\
  \ works left unsold, and began speaking with great enthusiasm about each piece.\
  \ We spent an unexpected evening with this eclectic group of art enthusiasts in\
  \ the depths of Paris, answering questions about Sonya\u2019s works that we really\
  \ had no business fielding, before departing chummily, promising Laurent to send\
  \ Sonya his love. \n\nBack to the future, we discover that the tourist trap caf\xE9\
  \ with bad lighting is actually Laurent\u2019s regular haunt, seldom discovered\
  \ by non-locals. The last person I expected to see in Paris, or ever again, gave\
  \ us the VIP treatment at his local watering hole and we spent our final evening\
  \ in France delighting once again over Sonya\u2019s work \u2013 and what a wonderful,\
  \ small world it really is."
