Text: "Instead of doing nothing and waste the rest of the day thinking what and where\
  \ life should be, I look in the internet for a trip that will have room for my life\
  \ adventure. And then I came across a blog with a title \u201CAdventure in Ilocos\
  \ Norte, Philippines\u201D, that really catches my attention because I knew that\
  \ this will be best well-matched on what I want to do; to dodging my predestined\
  \ everyday routine activity. So I planned a trip, on my own. It was started with\
  \ Manila to Laoag. I took 10 pm bus schedule for me able to get there early morning\
  \ and for the reason to sleep well during the trip. I arrived at around 8 am in\
  \ Laoag, I first set off to find the nearest restaurant where I can take my breakfast.\
  \ After my breakfast, I went straight to Provincial Capitol to check out Museo Ilocos\
  \ Norte to know the place I am up into and let their culture goes into my soul.\
  \ After visiting museum, I decided to do sightseeing, and first on the list, the\
  \ famous Ilocos Sinking Tower Bell, then, I headed on to Malacanang of the North,\
  \ a place where President Marcos of the Philippines and his family spent time together\
  \ during his reign. I don\u2019t have as much knowledge about late President Marcos,\
  \ but with my visit to his ancestral house, I started to like his his character.\
  \ I started to see him as a person with dignity. I\u2019m very impressed the way\
  \ he handled the position of being a President and a father for his family. Reading\
  \ all his works enlightened me about what life is during Martial Law. After I visited\
  \ all important places in Laoag, I decided to continue my trip to Pagupod, to take\
  \ rest and to spend my night as well. My trip to Laoag to Pagudpod took approximately\
  \ two hours by a local bus. The sun already set when I arrived in the area and dimness\
  \ falls speedily, a mixed of fear and excitement due to my first time to travel\
  \ alone. I looked around and fortunately a few steps from the bus stop, there was\
  \ tricycle station, so I talked to them to take me and find a place where I can\
  \ spend my night. People in Ilocos are very accommodating. I finished up staying\
  \ at Saud White beach resort which I\u2019m very pleased because I can have a beach\
  \ and accommodation at one. However, due to tiredness cause by long travel hours,\
  \ I got sleepy and decided to a take a rest. The next morning, I got up about 6\
  \ am and took a long walk around the beautiful white sand beach, there is no hurry,\
  \ so I sit and by then, I decided to take my swimming, I am determined to spent\
  \ my whole morning only for swimming, it\u2019s the best time to do the activity\
  \ because only few visitors swim that very early, the place is so quiet, I\u2019\
  ve spent a lot observing around with meditation.That time, I\u2019ve learned what\
  \ works for me in a place to live; that this is the life I wanted. My new found\
  \ sense of comfort that I felt good all over, that there are so many things life\
  \ can offer. It was refreshing; it was one of a kind. Five entire hours passed,\
  \ almost 11 am and I am still like a child playing with water, still very overwhelmed\
  \ with the way life should be, but I need to get out of the beach and need to maximize\
  \ my time, at this point, I decided to continue my escapade by visiting other areas\
  \ of Pagudpod. I talked to one of the caretaker of the resort and asked for help\
  \ if he could find me a service or a tour guide .Luckily he has one friend who is\
  \ willing to do the job for a minimal fee. The whole tour completed around 5 pm\
  \ which means the end of my day\u2019s adventure, or so I would have liked it to\
  \ be, I prepared myself and looked for the bus to take me back to Laoag as there\
  \ are no buses directly going to Manila."
