Text: "I kissed my burnt fingertips as I climbed into the driver\u2019s seat, mentally\
  \ preparing myself for the inevitable scorching grip on my steering wheel. The Sonoran\
  \ Desert was in record-high heat- I'd just made a solo journey across the country,\
  \ and refused to let the blistering Arizona sun discourage my wanderlust. My lifelines\
  \ at the moment  appeared to feel otherwise; my debit card and Johnny Cash cassette\
  \ melted and puddled across my dashboard, crying in agony. I put my cell phone under\
  \ my seat in an attempt to save it from it's own inevitable death. My air conditioner\
  \ had betrayed me days before in Reno, but even in an environment scorching with\
  \ hellfire, I was determined to satisfy my itch for discovery.\n\nWhere was my next\
  \ destination? I decided that was up to chance. It was critical that I simply go.\
  \ Navigating arbitrarily through Phoenix neighborhoods, I let a stifling breeze\
  \ dance through my windows, convincing myself it was, in fact, cooler than the interior\
  \ of my \u201Cmobile oven\u201D. Delirious from the searing sun-rays and my shaky,\
  \ arid breath, I fantasized cooking on a skillet in my passenger seat. Laughing\
  \ to myself, I spoke aloud, as if reciting a spell, \u201CI need shade.\u201D\n\n\
  With the next turn, there was a clearing. Beyond the stucco walls, beyond the heat\
  \ haze fluttering above the pavement, and beyond the deceptive palm trees, alluding\
  \ to some sort of tropical haven, there stood a lone mountain, reaching to the sun\
  \ in isolated zeal. He was cloaked in a magnificent copper hue, tanned by the infinite\
  \ summer he resided in. His crooked stature gave him a glow of confidence, unabashed\
  \ after being exiled by the flatland around him. He was bejeweled in green mosses\
  \ and sharp cliffs, gracefully defining his stamina above the insufferable Sonoran\
  \ Desert. Mesmerized, I knew I had to meet him.\n\nWith no phone, no GPS, and no\
  \ map, I was still determined to find solace in my new acquaintance. I began to\
  \ travel towards him, sometimes seeming closer, and sometimes worried I was only\
  \ getting further from my goal. My faith was restored when I could no longer see\
  \ pueblos in my rear-view mirror, and instead, gentle hills formed in front of me.\
  \ For the better part of an hour, I haphazardly raced towards him, intermittently\
  \ wiping sweat and tears from my eyes, yearning for a sanctuary in the devilish\
  \ blaze.\n\nI continued down a lonely road,  parallel with the mountain for several\
  \ miles. I began  questioning if I was going the right way, wondering if I would\
  \ ever make it. Then, like magic, I coasted down the next hill, dazed by the lush,\
  \ moist greenery appearing in the valley below. The road curved toward the mountain,\
  \ welcoming me to his home, eager for my arrival. I found a clearing in the shrubbery,\
  \ and parked next to a little trail, seemingly placed by the mountain himself so\
  \ he could greet me properly.  Hammock on my back and keys in my pocket, I ventured\
  \ down the trail. The air was no longer stifling, but salty and crisp. The echoes\
  \ of a desert highway were now replaced with birds singing hymns. The further down\
  \ the trail I went, the more foliage that reached out to embrace me.\n\nFinally,\
  \ there he was. The mountain was not forsaken like I originally believed, for he\
  \ was bound eternally with a river below. Her majestic waves gently caressing him,\
  \ nourishing the vegetation around them, climbing up the mountain like children\
  \ scrambling onto their father\u2019s back. Their relationship was tumultuous, but\
  \ strong, a perfect dichotomy of stillness and liberation. Taking a deep breath,\
  \ I looked across the water, sprinkled with crystals cut from the sun itself. A\
  \ dozen wild horses arrived by serendipity, angels in refuge, enjoying the river\
  \ and all her benevolence.\n\nA smile spread across my cheeks. I was no longer in\
  \ solitude but surrounded by new friends. After conquering through hellfire, and\
  \ finally resting in this nirvana, I began to question if this glory could be real.\
  \ Perhaps the sun boiled my blood and this was nothing more than a mirage. I swayed\
  \ in my hammock and rejoiced."
