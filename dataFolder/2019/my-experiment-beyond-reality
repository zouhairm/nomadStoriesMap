Text: "We had to leave next morning for home, so it was our last day in Varanasi.\
  \ Excited to make the most of our time, we left early to explore the \u2018city\
  \ of temples\u2019 and home to one of the twelve \u2018Jyotirlingas\u2019 of Lord\
  \ Shiva in India. Strolling in the streets, little did I knew that I would take\
  \ home an experience where my comprehension of the universe would come to a halt.\n\
  Right after dawn is when you can see the \u2018City of Ghats\u2019 unfolding into\
  \ this majestic sacred place where people can be seen washing their sins in the\
  \ holy water of the river Ganges. The morning \u2018Aarti\u2019 at the \u2018Dashashwamedh\
  \ Ghat' was a surreal experience with a huge crowd singing in chorus, and a rarity\
  \ where people and nature were complementing each other.\nAfter our tiny little\
  \ expedition we reached back to our hostel, tired and only to realize that we have\
  \ missed the \u2018Kashi Vishwanath Temple\u2019 where the \u2018Jyotirlinga\u2019\
  \ is rested. My determination and \u2018Hinduism\u2019 got the best of me hence,\
  \ along with a local friend, I left for the temple.\nThe temple is one of the places\
  \ which witnesses thousands of devotees from all around India. Reaching the place\
  \ I realized that my timing could not have been any better; it was the night of\
  \ \u2018Mahashivaratri\u2019, the day Lord Shiva is celebrated, and I was standing\
  \ in a place which hosts thousands of devotees, not just from India but from all\
  \ around the Globe. \nThere was no turning back, I joined the queue which passed\
  \ through five check-posts to check if we carrying anything suspicious because of\
  \ which we had already submitted our phones at a counter earlier. The constant chants\
  \ of \u2018Har Har Mahadev\u2019 and observing people dressed as Shiva, colored\
  \ in blue, time flew and more than three hours were gone. The officials were sending\
  \ the people inside, in batches. And no! Not to my bad luck; my friend was the last\
  \ from the batch that went before me; we were separated. \nMy turn came and I went\
  \ inside the temple to see, what was difficult to grasp and comprehend in the little\
  \ time I had there; \u2018Pandits\u2019, at least 8 of them, washing the Jyotirlinga\
  \ with milk; what I was seeing was beyond reality; a temple so small yet so magnificent.\
  \ But I was quickly thrown out from the other side with the next batch entering.\
  \ \nGroups of people dressed like the deity and the chants from all around held\
  \ my attention for a while. I was lost. Regaining my conscience, I could not see\
  \ my friend anywhere. I looked for him around but could not find him. The whole\
  \ place with almost identical streets and shops was a maze, where even after trying\
  \ hard I could not find the counter I kept my belongings at. I was young, afraid,\
  \ lost and felt helpless. \nMy face radiated my bother which a gentleman caught\
  \ and asked if I needed help. I was aware of not trusting a stranger but I somehow\
  \ trusted him, taking every step very cautiously. He was bald headed, had a briefcase\
  \ which indicated he was returning back from work. He safely led me to the counter\
  \ where I had initially kept my stuff, also finding my local friend there. To thank\
  \ him when I turned I could see no one; my friend saw no one coming with me. I reckoned\
  \ he must have left without me noticing. \nBut here\u2019s what I realized later,\
  \ reaching the hostel, I was standing out of the temple lost in a narrow street\
  \ knowing nothing, not even the name of the shops near the counter. All I could\u2019\
  ve told the man was that I was lost and had my belongings stored at a certain counter.\
  \ How could he have possibly known the exact counter, the exact street? How could\
  \ I not see his face? How did he disappear so quickly? I understand it would be\
  \ absurd to call him God or anyone equal to him; but aren\u2019t people like him\
  \ the real devotees! Helping someone without expectations of any acknowledgement.\
  \ To him, if he ever reads this; if he\u2019s real or more; Thank You."
