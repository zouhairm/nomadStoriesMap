Text: "Traveling is a healthy addiction. Experiencing other lifestyles and indulging\
  \ into unfamiliar cultures, if done whole-heartedly, can bring one to an apiffony,\
  \ a reconsideration rather, of what he or she wants and needs , but also what he\
  \ or she has to offer to the worlds\u2019 wants and needs in this lifetime. \n\n\
  I have never declared my glass of life to be neither half empty, nor half full.\
  \ Though sometimes the equilibrium feels shifted towards one more than the other,\
  \ I figure out how to find balance. \n\nThis past November, I felt my glass getting\
  \ low and decided I would refill it in Barcelona, Spain. I felt an overwhelming\
  \ emotional response to joy, love, and even regret while there. I saw every color\
  \ so clearly, I turned off my phone because I knew that taking a photo would not\
  \ do this country\u2019s beauty justice, and quite honestly... I selfishly wanted\
  \ this memory for myself. Not for Instagram followers. \n\nTraveling can be abused\
  \ as a way for people to gain attention, yet it should be about giving the world\u2019\
  s details due credit and admiration. \n\nWithout getting too personal, I may have\
  \ also traveled this distance for love. I found it there waiting for me, and soon\
  \ after, whatever love I had left behind didn\u2019t feel like love anymore. Four\
  \ days in a foreign country exposed me to a new way of filtering refreshing air,\
  \ a new kind of cuisine, a new language (that I actually picked up on quite quickly\
  \ because I took Italian all my life\u2014 Regret #1 was not taking Spanish in high\
  \ school)! \n\nExplained on the most absurd way, I met Sarafina Mancuso on November\
  \ 1st, 2018 in Barcelona, Spain and she was joyful. Fulfilled, even. Her glass,\
  \ do I dare say it? Was full. \n\n\nI guess I need a bigger glass."
