Text: "Unending joy. Excitement. Hope. A few of many words welcomed into my vocabulary\
  \ as I departed from Guatemala City in 2016 after spending a month immersed with\
  \ a mission group serving in the villages in Zacapa. You see, we all are searching\
  \ for these very things, yet we become blindsided with the luxuries we have here\
  \ in the states. You want a new phone? We go buy it. New clothes? There\u2019s a\
  \ store on every corner. Not in zacapa. Here life is simple, joy is found in the\
  \ most beautiful freeing ways. Joy is found in relationships, in hugs, in adventures.\
  \ You see, when I was in the village in Zacapa these individuals don\u2019t go home\
  \ to tv\u2019s and iPhones. They go home to huts that could be destroyed by a simple\
  \ rain storm. Their fun isn\u2019t going to the mall, it\u2019s making fake dolls\
  \ out of mud and conversing with others in their village. Joy is found in digging\
  \ a hole and finding water you can actually drink. Although, these very things I\
  \ knew in my mind were the call to joy, it wasn\u2019t until I was sleeping in an\
  \ eno with no air conditioning and hugging little girls who could not understand\
  \ me at all because they only could speak Spanish that this joy was shed to light.\
  \ We live in this world to love others and to bring value to them so we can each\
  \ live out our purpose that God made us for. This trip to Guatemala that I left\
  \ on to serve lead me to the simple reality that we live to love, we don\u2019t\
  \ need anything. The pleasures we can purchase are nothing but temporary pleasures\
  \ that run dry. Permeant joy is in relationships and bringing people to a place\
  \ of their value that God created them for. Don\u2019t be blindsided by the distractions\
  \ in this world for you my brothers and sisters were created for so much more. That\u2019\
  s why I urge you- travel, write that book, hug that friend, have that conversation,\
  \ forgive, and don\u2019t stop. For that my friend is the answer to joy that you\
  \ are seeking."
