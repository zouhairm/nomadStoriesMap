Text: "The sweet strawberry tartlets that my mom put in front of our maindoor had\
  \ always been my lunch ..\nFor me it has always been the most delicious meal..\n\
  I was so young , so naive but I enjoy every little bit of that country ..\nThe weather,\
  \ the meat pie, the park ...the big supermarket near our house that always been\
  \ my favourite routine with my mom...\nThough I never get the chance to buy any\
  \ toys that i want but just dreaming of playing with it had made me satisfied\n\
  Never knew why dad had always been so hurry early in the morning while only having\
  \ buns and sausages for years \nAnd only see him again late at night... while I\
  \ was already so sleepy after having just white rice and maggie sauce as my dinner\
  \ ...\nYummy ... delicious dinner was what I had in my memories till today ...\n\
  those days, fullfillness is what I feel everyday happiness and smile had always\
  \ within me ..\n\n33 years since that time, here I am at the 23rd Floor with a great\
  \ city view but emptiness is what I feel every second...\nEveryday i think hard\
  \ ... and now I know ..\nMaybe im in love .. \n\nBeing far far away from my childhood\
  \ memory made me sad and it just feels like missing somebody and never had the chance\
  \ to meet them again ...\n\nAt my not so young age anymore , I just knew that Im\
  \ in love with a country\nA country called Australia...\n\nOne day maybe\nI\u2019\
  ll be part of it again ...\nOne day ...\nMaybe ...."
