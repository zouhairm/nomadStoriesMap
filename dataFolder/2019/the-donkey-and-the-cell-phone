Text: "\u201CHere,\u201D my teacher said, handing me a cup of mate de coca. \u201C\
  Drink, we\u2019ll be on the water soon.\u201D \nI took the cup gratefully, shivering\
  \ in the strange room, looking out onto the wet streets of Pu\xF1o. The main thing\
  \ I saw in the street were piles of trash. \nWe were in a room of a friend of a\
  \ friend of my Spanish teacher\u2019s, waiting for our tour to start. We were set\
  \ to take a boat around the famed Lake Titicaca, which straddles the border of Peru\
  \ and Bolivia.  \nPeru and Pu\xF1o have plenty of their own natural beauty, but\
  \ in my first weeks in Peru, I often remember the trash. Heaps of it, piled everywhere.\
  \ \nI\u2019d never appreciated how clean Montana was until I left it.\nI forgot\
  \ about the trash when we finally got on our tiny boat, and the sun came out. The\
  \ beauty of the lake began to shine through. We made the requisite stop at the floating\
  \ islands before heading on to the island of Amantani, for a homestay. \nThe lake\
  \ was showing off under a clear sky when we arrived. The island was beautiful and\
  \ remote. I immediately bonded with my host family when I mistook the little boy\u2019\
  s headache for him requesting beer (\u201CCerveza? El ni\xF1o???\u201D). \nAt first\
  \ all I could see were the differences\u2014the kitchen of the house we were staying\
  \ in only had a fire. It was essentially a little dirt room that I had to duck into,\
  \ because in Peru I am a giantess. One of the other girls on the tour was staying\
  \ in the nicest house on the island, so called this because it had hot water, at\
  \ least when the sun shined. I saw the carts pulled by donkeys and traditional skirts\
  \ on women. I saw rough stone walls and the select few buildings with electricity.\
  \ \nSlowly, I began to notice the similarities. They will become evident if you\
  \ spend time in any place long enough. I saw children playing football. I saw men\
  \ laughing over their beer, and kids running behind us to peek at the gringas. We\
  \ climbed to the top of the island, an old worship site with a gorgeous view. \n\
  Coming down from the top, we got lost. The island isn\u2019t exactly large, but\
  \ we took a wrong turn somewhere and ended up walking past a field. The only person\
  \ in sight was a man, pulling his donkey through a field. \n\u201CYou do it,\u201D\
  \ my Spanish teacher told me\u2014she never lost a chance to make me rehearse my\
  \ language skills.  She was especially insistent after the cerveza vs. cabeza incident.\
  \ \u201CYou must practice!\u201D \nI hailed him (\u201Chola, amigo!\u201D\u2014\
  I could feel my teacher rolling her eyes behind me), and as he walked towards me,\
  \ I realized he was on the phone. A cell phone. In a field. With a donkey. On an\
  \ island that, to my knowledge, had very little electricity. \nThe man merrily ended\
  \ his call, and my stumbling Spanish resulted in hilarity. Eventually he discovered\
  \ we were staying in his house\u2014so of course he knew the way. My teacher took\
  \ over to confirm the directions, and after a quick exchange, he went back to his\
  \ donkey and his phone. \nLater that night, I ran into the same man in the inner\
  \ courtyard of their house. He wasn\u2019t on his phone\u2014he was looking at the\
  \ stars. It seemed surprising that someone who seemed to have so little, who bore\
  \ the signs of hard labor in his hunched back and heavily lined face, would take\
  \ a moment to appreciate the stars. I followed suit instinctively, as if expecting\
  \ to see something significant. He really was just\u2026stargazing. \nIt was my\
  \ first experience gazing at the stars of the southern hemisphere. The constellations\
  \ aren\u2019t the same. Yet, the sky is familiar.\n\u201CMira,\u201D The man\u2014\
  whose name I never did learn\u2014said. \u201CLa cruz del sur.\u201D He pointed\
  \ out the Southern Cross. He pointed out several other constellations, telling me\
  \ stories about each, like many others, making sense of their world via the night\
  \ sky. His finger pointed to the stars, and his eyes were kind, and I listened."
