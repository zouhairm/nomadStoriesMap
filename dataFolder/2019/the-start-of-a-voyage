Text: "In India, specifically in Maharashtra it is quite common in trekkers to trek\
  \ the forts as there are abundant.  I had a group of friends who would come up with\
  \ new names of the forts and decisively visit it without spending much of the time\
  \ in planning. I was never a part of them as I was more of a voracious reader and\
  \ opted to sit and read than to explore. But thanks to these lovely friends, they\
  \ gave me a new way of living and a source of pure happiness.\nOne fine day, when\
  \ they were short of one of their team mate they thought of taking me with them\
  \ to Rajgad, a fort near Pune, Maharashtra. It is one of the most important forts\
  \ in the medieval times. The fort for many years was under the rule of Chattrapati\
  \ Shivaji maharaj, a King who carved out a kingdom from three different kingdoms.\n\
  I was hesitant but friends are renowned to force you into something you wouldn\u2019\
  t do yourself. \nI was at the footsteps of Rajgad. It was October, the monsoon has\
  \ just stopped and the nature was at its most green state. Honestly, I was unaware\
  \ that I would find such a pleasant welcome. We started hiking and I could find\
  \ numerous different species of plants that nobody would have heard of. The Western\
  \ Ghats also known as sahyaris is world heritage site of UNESCO and is the hottest\
  \ of the hot spots of biological diversity. But to hear and to watch is a total\
  \ different feeling. The leaves of the different plants have different shades of\
  \ green. Moreover, there are differently coloured plants that grab your attention\
  \ and then you find out that it is not a plant but an insect in the shape of leaves.\
  \ \nThere were monkeys who were our hosts and they loved to grab whatever they would\
  \ get, this type of hospitality is hardly seen. We could hear hyenas but were not\
  \ very sure about it. Despite this beauty, I was getting exhausted while hiking\
  \ and at a point I felt that I have made a mistake to accompany my friends but one\
  \ of them grabbed a fruit, it looked like a cherry but it wasn\u2019t. He told me\
  \ that the fruit gives instant energy, I grabbed a couple of them. Later I was the\
  \ one who was heading the team.\nWhen we reached the top of the mountain, I experienced\
  \ the coldest breeze. It was so soothing that it made me feel like I was in my home\
  \ on my couch and air conditioner is at the minimum temperature. It was evening\
  \ by the time we reached the fort. Believe me, it is extremely bewitching to see\
  \ the sunset from that point. We found a temple and decided to spend the night in\
  \ it. \nI had decided to see the sunrise the next day and set my alarm to 6. I don\u2019\
  t know why but I was up at 5 am. Birds were already up and had started their routine.\
  \ As the sunlight spread, the view was more like a beautiful and colossal nature\
  \ portrait. The mountain ranges, the dense jungles, the chirping birds and the old\
  \ historic structures that say something mesmerized every person there. The friends\
  \ who usually spoke crap too were finding no words to express. As the sun rose we\
  \ rushed to our daily chores. We started visiting different monuments and if one\
  \ knows the history he would get a strange feeling of bonding, one would feel that\
  \ the walls of these forts are talking. One could sense the history and take a dip\
  \ in the medieval time situations. \nIt was such a wonderful experience that I did\
  \ not want to return. On the way, I could see the sky scrapers and huge buildings\
  \ but those weren\u2019t as beautiful as the mountains I saw. I had tears, the tears\
  \ of joy for I had found a new way to enjoy the life. A way to bond with the earth.\
  \ That experience has developed a love of going to new places, visiting unknown\
  \ people, stepping on the road rarely used and most importantly travel on a very\
  \ short notice."
