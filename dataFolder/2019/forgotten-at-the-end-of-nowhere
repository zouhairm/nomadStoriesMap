Text: "The children\u2019s quarrel cut through the darkness as sharp and vain as a\
  \ knife sliced through water. It was 5.30 in the morning. I gave up on trying to\
  \ sleep and opened my eyes, only to squint it against the blinding light of an oncoming\
  \ car. For a moment, the shabbiness of environment had nowhere to hide, tattered\
  \ seats, rusty handles and windows dull with grime. Everything was wrapped in a\
  \ lingering smell of fish. We were on a bus to Ca Mau Cape, the southernmost point\
  \ of Vietnam and also of the Indochinese mainland; or at least that was what we\
  \ were told. \n\n\u201CNot many tourists know about this bus. Mostly just locals.\
  \ It will take you to the cape,\u201D the assurance of a colleague rang disturbingly\
  \ loud in our well-lit  hotel room as she forwarded us a telephone number. There\
  \ was no business name, no contact information, just ten digits that \u201CI got\
  \ from a street vendor\u201D. \u201CThis is ridiculous,\u201D I said. The statement\
  \ fell meekly into the background music, a signature song of Ca Mau that I had put\
  \ on earlier to set up an atmosphere. \u201CIt is said that Ca Mau is far beyond\
  \ imagination, a land at the end of nowhere,\u201D the singer crooned sweetly. My\
  \ friend dialed the number.\n\nOur saviour was a minibus that did not seem to run\
  \ on any schedule. It stopped randomly and constantly, on a bridge, in front of\
  \ a market, next to a bush, and one time, pulled in right in front of a wooden house\
  \ that sat half on land, half on water. People got on, people got off, packages\
  \ were handed over and packages were received. As the transportation navigated the\
  \ narrow, bumpy road that cut through the swamplands of the Mekong Delta like a\
  \ web of veins on a leaf, spreading out before my eyes was a dizzying green carpet\
  \ of rice paddies, coconut palms and mangroves; locals scampering over monkey bridges\
  \ or rowing boats on a maze of channels.\n\nOur destination was the Ca Mau Cape\
  \ Tourism and Cultural Park, a 120-hectare area that was 120 km away from the city.\
  \ Swamping up to greet us was an army of bikers, all locals eager to be hired for\
  \ a drive around the park. We asked for a customized trip that brought us to all\
  \ the monuments that marked the end of a country and took no more than thirty minutes,\
  \ in order to be back in time for our bus to the city instead of waiting four hours\
  \ for the next one. \u201CYou rode a four-hour bus here for a thirty-minute trip?!\u201D\
  , my driver said incredulously as he sped up. I laughed and tried, through the salty\
  \ wind that was messing up my hair, through the scorching sunlight spilling all\
  \ over my driver\u2019s grubby shirt, to take in the last images of a place that\
  \ held much symolic significance to Vietnamese people: scattered construction sites,\
  \ an abandoned floating restaurant that must have been lovely with its blue roof,\
  \ an arch bridge of bare and gray concrete \u2013 stood tall and clumsy and as sad\
  \ as being forgotten. \n\nFor a Mekong Delta\u2019s province, Ca Mau offered nothing\
  \ that could not be experienced in its neighbours, either landscape, cuisine or\
  \ architecture. For a place that mark the country\u2019s endpoint, it could only\
  \ dream of the ethereal and grandeur scenery of mountainous Ha Giang, its counterpart\
  \ in the north. And while the desolation of Ha Giang spoke of untouchedness and\
  \ wilderness, Ca Mau\u2019s whispered of . \n\nOnce again, the bus lurched its way\
  \ down the winding road. I lifted my legs off the bus floor and my friend and I,\
  \ we watched it swing like a clock pendulum went wild. We laughed a little. The\
  \ bus operator turned toward us, on his hand was a business card, colourful and\
  \ clumsily designed. \u201CIf someday you want to visit again,\u201D he said, his\
  \ voice thick and his smile as bright and genuine as the infamous blazing Mekong\
  \ Delta sunlight that was rushing us by."
