Text: "Winter in Beijing means at least two layers of pants. Even though it hardly\
  \ ever snows or rains in the city.\nFourth Uncle lives alone in Beijing's hutongs,\
  \ traditional-styled alleyways that've recently become the former imperial city's\
  \ \"cultural heritage\" tourism sites. Underneath Fourth Uncle\u2019s toughened\
  \ exterior is a wealth of stories. He\u2019s one of a unique group of elderly Chinese\u2014\
  often dubbed China's \u201CLost Generation\u201D\u2014whose lives and histories\
  \ grow further from us every day.\nFourth Uncle told me to call him \u201CFourth\u201D\
  \ because he was the fourth of seven children\u2014five boys and two girls\u2014\
  and \u201CUncle\u201D because, well, in China, everyone was an uncle (or an aunt\
  \ or a brother or a sister), even without relation. Back when Fourth Uncle was growing\
  \ up, when the hutongs were blue-collar neighborhoods with tin roofs and leaky gutters\
  \ and it wasn\u2019t yet cool to take photos in them, he and his brothers used to\
  \ race through them, scaling rooftops and climbing trees.\nWe were sitting in the\
  \ house in which he grew up, where the bed takes up more than half the main room.\
  \ A coffee table and some chairs take up the rest. The adjoining room? A kitchen\
  \ the size of a closet.\n\u201CYou used to live here with six siblings and your\
  \ parents?\u201D I asked, incredulous. He nodded solemnly, and lit a cigarette.\n\
  But, in 1969, Fourth Uncle was \u201Csent-down\u201D to the province of Jilin in\
  \ China\u2019s northeast, as part of the Cultural Revolution. Urban families with\
  \ two or more children had to send one to the countryside in order to be \u201C\
  reeducated,\u201D and learn the ways of the peasantry. Never mind that many of the\
  \ city\u2019s residents were \u201Cproletarian\u201D in their poverty. Fourth Uncle\
  \ volunteered to go, sparing his siblings.\nFor all of Beijing\u2019s cold, China\u2019\
  s northeast is something else entirely. Fourth Uncle recalled his train, loaded\
  \ with other excited, nervous young people, slowing to a standstill in Changchun\
  \ in Jilin province. A light rain was falling when they disembarked.\n\u201CIt was\
  \ a different kind of rain,\u201D he said. \u201CI could tell: this was no ordinary\
  \ cold.\u201D\nHe was 17 years old then.\nHe stayed there for 22 years.\nIt wasn\u2019\
  t that he didn\u2019t want to leave Jilin. But by the time he was done, the state\
  \ had changed his residential permit, and he wasn\u2019t legally allowed to return\
  \ to Beijing. He had also married a woman from Jilin. When he eventually made it\
  \ back to Beijing, bringing her with him, he no longer knew his home city.\nFourth\
  \ Uncle considers the send-down movement one of the worst programs from that era.\
  \ He was fortunate, he said, since women frequently had it worse, with commonplace\
  \ sexual violence. \u201CWhen you\u2019re that young, you don\u2019t really know\
  \ anything,\u201D he said. \u201CYou\u2019re away from people who care about you\
  \ at a time when their guidance is crucial.\u201D\nWe walked out of the house and\
  \ stood in the alleyway. Fourth Uncle lit another cigarette. It was the end of the\
  \ Spring Festival, and tourists were beginning to pour in. Top of their itinerary?\
  \ This area. A few tourists even stopped and openly gawked at Fourth Uncle's local\
  \ accent, still strong despite two decades away.\nFourth Uncle\u2019s hutong is\
  \ being demolished and rebuilt, and its residents pushed out, in a campaign to improve\
  \ \u201Ccultural neighborhoods.\u201D The campaign is also supported by improvements\
  \ to accessibility and fire safety. But the hutong dwellers aren\u2019t concerned\
  \ about fire, or the evenness of the pavement. They\u2019ve lived here through the\
  \ turmoil of the last century. They\u2019re concerned about how many of them had\
  \ home swept out from under their feet when they were young. About how they\u2019\
  re about to have home taken from them again, in their old age.\nFourth Uncle stamped\
  \ out his cigarette. He doesn\u2019t know where he\u2019ll go when they come for\
  \ his two-room house.\n\u201CEverything changes so quickly,\u201D he said.\nThe\
  \ smog was bad that day, choking the evening. A little rain would\u2019ve cleared\
  \ the week's air quality right up, but the weather reports promised nothing.\nWe\
  \ could only wait. Wait, as dusk fell, and the red holiday lanterns strung up in\
  \ the alleyway glowed like little knockoff suns in the gloom."
