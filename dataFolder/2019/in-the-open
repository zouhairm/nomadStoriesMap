Text: "I greeted him in much the same way as any tuk-tuk driver I had encountered\
  \ during my weeks in that beautiful, humid and trying country. Once the cursory\
  \ handshake was done, the price agreed and destination established, I spent little\
  \ time on conversation, preferring instead to focus on the ever-changing, quotidian\
  \ life flitting by.\n\nThat morning then, to my lazily unobservant eyes, he didn\u2019\
  t appear to be any different to the other drivers. There were polite smiles, jabbing\
  \ of fingers at maps and a repeating of my destination in a clumsy distortion of\
  \ the intricate, foreign language until an understanding was reached. The slight\
  \ anxiety that always accompanied such exchanges done, I settled back in the tuk-tuk\
  \ and prepared for the relentless humidity that would intensify as the day progressed.\n\
  \nWe shuddered to a stop at my first destination. I gulped down some water in the\
  \ oppressive heat and gazed in silent awe at the sheer limestone wall that rose\
  \ suddenly out of the flat ground. \u20184,000 years old\u2019 he said. His face\
  \ was alight with pride as he gazed at the rock-face with me. He gestured towards\
  \ the vine-dripping mouth of a cave and ushered me forwards. I entered the cool\
  \ air and began my exploring while he leaned against the tuk-tuk to wait.\n\nThe\
  \ day continued in a sort of routine. The engine would gun to life as I arranged\
  \ myself on the leather seat which quickly became slick with sweat. There was more\
  \ shouting of destinations and pointing at maps. The tuk-tuk would slow to a stop\
  \ at the next landmark. I would trek - panting with the effort in the merciless\
  \ humidity. I would drink in the unfamiliarity of my tropical surroundings, fumble\
  \ for my camera and 'click'. The engine would gun into life again. I passed through\
  \ salt fields, pepper farms, fish markets.\n\nAfter a lunch of rice by a churning,\
  \ grey river, I was preparing again for the bone-jarring drive ahead when he turned\
  \ and asked \u2018you would like to see a beautiful house?\u2019\n\nI hesitated,\
  \ it hadn\u2019t appeared in my research of the area, but feeling obliged, I nodded\
  \ and smiled. \n\nA few minutes later, the tuk-tuk spluttered to a halt at the gates\
  \ of what I guessed was a colonial-era mansion. I was struck by the loveliness of\
  \ the faded, crumbling fa\xE7ade and the serene silence. It was beautiful in its\
  \ eeriness. Perfectly decrepit. An abundance of overgrown flowers and vines spilled\
  \ over windows and doorways. A tattered flag attached to a rusting flagpole fluttered\
  \ in the breeze. The breeze that never offered any respite from the heat. \n\n\u2018\
  Khmer Rouge\u2019 he had walked with me towards the peeling, iron gates which shut\
  \ us out from the grounds. \u2019They took this house.\u2019 he said.  \nThrough\
  \ the shimmering heat I could make out small groups of people. Reclining on the\
  \ veranda. Smoking in huddles. Hanging wet clothes out of windows to dry. All in\
  \ silence.  \u2018Squatters\u2019 he told me. \n\n\u2018My mother worked in a place\
  \ like this, in the kitchen. For the Khmer Rouge. They put my father in the fields.\
  \ They were not allowed to eat. She stole food and brought it home for my father\
  \ and for us. She kept us all alive. They might have killed her if they found the\
  \ food, but she always stole it, every day.\u2019 I struggled to find anything meaningful\
  \ to say and offered only murmurs of acknowledgement. \n\nA memory of childhood\
  \ history lessons stirred as we walked back. Something I had not thought of in a\
  \ long time. A great hunger and oppression that had once gripped my own island in\
  \ generations gone. I turned towards him to offer\u2026.what exactly? A feeble attempt\
  \ at an understanding of a suffering my ancestors might have shared, but I had never\
  \ experienced? He was already speaking though. \u2018Home?\u2019 he was asking.\n\
  \nHurtling back in the cooler evening air, I attempted to make conversation. I asked\
  \ his name.\n\n A name was given, and is now forgotten."
