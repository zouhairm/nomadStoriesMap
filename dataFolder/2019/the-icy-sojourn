Text: "The sun was nowhere to be seen.Yet, the sight I beheld in front of my eyes\
  \ fixated me on the steadily sailing inflatable rubber zodiac as I marvelled at\
  \ the most brilliant crimson orange dawn I had ever seen in my life.For the very\
  \ first time, I viewed the sun with such fervent reverence.What I saw ahead was\
  \ an oil painting on a canvas which was the sky.Humongous and steep mountains of\
  \ ice emerging from the depths of the ocean were silhouetted against the majestic\
  \ warmth of the entire frame.\n\nI was at the Lemaire Channel, a strait off the\
  \ coldest, driest and windiest place on Earth \u2013 Antarctica.True to its nickname\
  \ \u201CKodak Gap\u201D by some, the channel lies between Kiev peninsula in the\
  \ mainland\u2019s Graham Island and Booth Island.\nAs the zodiac moved steadily\
  \ along the icy cove, the sun seemed to shower its aura, smearing the mountain caps\
  \ with a balm of elegance.The peaks gleamed on the crystal clear waters as if admiring\
  \ their own splendour.The only discordant sound was the inevitable rumble of the\
  \ zodiac motors.To much respite, the engines were shut a while later and the burble\
  \ of the waters caressed the ears, as the zodiac steered its way amidst thousands\
  \ of fragments of ice which had separated from glaciers and finally left to float\
  \ on their own.The calm of the heavenly silence was occasionally broken by the splash\
  \ of the shiny fur seals, some of whom would emerge from the waters and climb the\
  \ blocks of ice swimming nearby whilst some would be curiously onlooking the human\
  \ visitors as aliens in their habitat.\nBy now, the sun had a wide grin and blessed\
  \ the already picturesque landscape. A section of this wonderland was now glimmering\
  \ in the golden rays of the morning while another part comprising large ice shelves\
  \ masked by the high peaks displayed a brilliant blue hue.It was a scintillating\
  \ display of colours. At a distance were a flock of Antarctic petrels which indicated\
  \ a high density of krill in the vicinity which in turn signalled a possible presence\
  \ of humpback whales.It made me wonder about our food chain and the wonderful ecosystem\
  \ of mother nature which we have molested over ages for our vested interests and\
  \ it dawned upon me that if there is one region on our planet which should be left\
  \ alone, it is Antarctica.\n\nLemaire Channel is a place which would remain etched\
  \ in my memory forever."
