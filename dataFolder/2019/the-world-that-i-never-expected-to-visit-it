Text: "When i was a kid, i had a dream. I want to see and explore my family history.\
  \ \n\nMy grandmom was always told me about her past. She was grow up and got married\
  \ in the war period, when Japan invaded Indonesia, long time ago. She told me about\
  \ how to survive and how she meet up with her 1st sister in law. That's why i have\
  \ a passion to explore about something historical when i travel to somewhere.\n\n\
  I had ever been in Sambas, Pemangkat, Bengkayang and Singkawang city, West borneo\
  \ province. I really2 love that cities, because i can explore more about the food,\
  \ local culture, and of course the history. For the example, when i was in Singkawang,\
  \ one week ago. I came to a traditional house, called \"Thai buk\"/\"Thjia family\
  \ house\"(chinesse hakka langguage). It's a chinesse house from Thjia family, it\
  \ was build since 1902. Beside the \"Thai buk\", you can find a home that selling\
  \ \"chai kwe\" (traditional chinesse dumpling). It's so famous \"chai kwe\" in Singkawang.\
  \ By the way, Singkawang is known for the \"Cap goh meh\" festival too. Every year\
  \ in  15th of 1st month, Lunar Calendar. Many tourist from the another city or from\
  \ the overseas come to Singkawang, just to see the festival.. There was a chinesse\
  \ culture parade such lion dance, dragon dance, \"tatung\" (in chinesse culture,\
  \ it's believe the man is possesed by gods or the spirits of ancestors) and another\
  \ act."
