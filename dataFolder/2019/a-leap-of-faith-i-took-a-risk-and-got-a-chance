Text: "Year 2014, I left my team Leader position in Project Verizon- Accenture, Manila\
  \ Philippines and came here in UAE on a tourist visa to apply for a job. I can still\
  \ remember that day when I landed in DXB Terminal 2 Airport, I had a terrible migraine\
  \ headache maybe it was jet lag, we rode a taxi bound to Sharjah and I ask my friend\
  \ to stop it on the way since  I can\u2019t bear the migraine headache \U0001F915\
  \ and I really needed to puke. I felt relieved after that, we ate from McDonalds\
  \ and after sometimes rode another Taxi to Sharjah. The next day, I felt so much\
  \ better but I was missing home, I was thinking if I did the right decision to quit\
  \ my job and come here. Anyway, after three days of resting I started my job hunting\
  \ from all the job sites; Bayt, Naukrigulf, GulfTalent, Monsterfulf, LinkedIn and\
  \ Dubbizle... after some days I got calls for interview. My 1st interview was in\
  \ Deira Dubai, it was a secretary position for an Insurance company but I was not\
  \ able to get the position. The next interview was near Oud Metha Station, Dubai\
  \ it was a Sales position for a company dealing with mobiles and other gadgets,\
  \ I still didn\u2019t get the post. This is my 2nd and a half week in UAE and I\
  \ still didn\u2019t get a job, and my friend decided to go home in the Philippines\
  \ for two weeks. I felt more sad to think that I still didn\u2019t get a job and\
  \ she\u2019s leaving me in this foreign country alone. After she left, I made a\
  \ pack and a promise to myself that I can handle this and that I will be able to\
  \ find a job before she comes back from vacation. It was a pack with myself that\
  \ is full of determination and hope. It was on May 19th when Nabeel Perfumes Industries\
  \ (FZE) called me for an interview to their head office in SAIF Zone, it\u2019s\
  \ a perfume company. Their are 6 people during the interview and I was the one selected\
  \ for the Front Office position. I was so happy and really relieved, I mean the\
  \ offer was not that much but the benefits are good and I feel like it\u2019s a\
  \ good company. They asked me to report at work next day, after two days of working\
  \ with them I need to exit in Kish Iran- another foreign country for my empoyment\
  \ visa.  My visa came nextday and yey! I\u2019m officially employed and working.\
  \ I may have not detailed everything in this story but what I went thru made me\
  \ a stronger person, it made me realize that their is always hope and we can always\
  \ achieve a goal if we persevere and believe. \n\nI\u2019m going 5years with the\
  \ company on May 20th, I\u2019m still thinking if I will renew my 3rd visa with\
  \ them or if it\u2019s time to move on and find another pasture...\n\nA leap of\
  \ faith, I took risks and got a chance \U0001F642\nWhat\u2019s your story and what\u2019\
  s the scariest move you did for your career?"
