Text: "My partner and I arrived in Zadar International Airport via Dublin not knowing\
  \ what to expect from a last minute booking. We were yearning to get away after\
  \ a hectic few months of work. As we disembarked the plane a waft of warm air was\
  \ a welcome tonic coming from the temperate Irish climate and we immediately felt\
  \ at ease. \n\nWe hopped on a bus and wound our way round dusty roads onwards to\
  \ our destination. We arrived 20 minutes later in the picturesque port of Petr\u010D\
  ane. A fishing village nestled on the Dalmatian coast, just 12 km north of Zadar.\
  \ We were greeted at our cottage by an elderly woman. She didn\u2019t speak much\
  \ english but a warm welcome never gets lost in translation. We dropped our bags\
  \ and set out to explore the sights. Stopping for a swim in the sun kissed sea.\
  \ \n\nA brief siesta and onto Konoba Orka for the catch of the day. We camped outside\
  \ on the veranda, post meal, drink in hand and took in the sumptuous sunset and\
  \ heard a distant beat emanating from the peninsula. \n\nWe were informed by Mateo,\
  \ our waiter, that there was a festival happening in \u2018The Garden Resort\u2019\
  \ just across the promenade. A short stroll along the pier and we entered the open\
  \ air auditorium of the renowned Barbella\u2019s nightclub, greeted by thronging\
  \ masses, lost in music. The atmosphere was electric and captivating. \n\nWe spoke\
  \ with one of the revellers, Ganni from Italy, who informed us that the population\
  \ of this tiny town swells in the summertime, with people from all four corners\
  \ of the globe, who make the pilgrimage to this site annually to soak up the sights\
  \ and sounds. We danced under the sparkling stars, the moon acting as our mirrorball\
  \ and enjoyed a stunning sunrise, hand in hand, on our walk home. A serendipitous\
  \ and spontaneous night out, the best kind. \n\n\u201CHair of the dog\u201D was\
  \ the order of the day, after a spot of brunch in a local cafe, the following morning.\
  \ Nursing a slight hangover I decided that it was much needed and we ventured back\
  \ over to the festival site. The tempo slightly more relaxed and rather soothing.\
  \ People laying around on sun loungers, strewn along sandy beaches. Hammocks hooked\
  \ to trees. A heady mix of blissed out beats.\n\nLater that day we took a taxi to\
  \ Zadar to check out more of the locale. Our first stop was a visit to \u2018The\
  \ National Museum\u2019 and we learned of the region\u2019s chequered history. We\
  \ roamed around the Roman and Venetian ruins for the evening with a fresh sense\
  \ of perspective. We then opted to take in the postcard perfect panoramic view of\
  \ this ancient city from the 'Cathedral Bell Tower'. The terracotta toned architecture\
  \ providing a stunning contrast with the beautiful blues of the Adriatic sea. A\
  \ Mediterranean mosaic. \n\nFood was the only thing on the menu after a day's exploring.\
  \ We sampled some of the world famous Mediterranean cuisine at 'Restaurant Kastel'.\
  \ Which has a beautiful old world feel, with a high level of service.  We were encouraged\
  \ to sample \u2018Maraschino\u2019 an aperitif made from locally sourced marasca\
  \ cherries. Distilleries in Zadar have produced Maraschino since the 16th century.\
  \ \n\nAfter dinner we sauntered through the slinky slide streets making our way\
  \ to the harbour. We were serenaded with the sweet sounds of the \u2018Sea Organ\u2019\
  \ and marveled at the \u2018Monument to the Sun\u2019 which acts as a solar sun-catcher\
  \ by day and spews all seven shades of the rainbow at night. A hive of activity\
  \ as tourists gather to watch the ships sail by the sea shore.\n\nWe capped the\
  \ night off by walking along the port and saw the luminous lights of \u2018Ledana\u2019\
  \ lounge trickling through the trees ahead. We followed the music and entered the\
  \ bar and took root on a comfy couch and enjoyed some chic cocktails, surrounded\
  \ by greenery, with a peek of the port. We both reflected on a weekend for the books\
  \ and wished we had more time to sample all the cultural delights and rich heritage\
  \ the town has to offer. \n\nZadar the cool jewel in the Croatian Crown."
