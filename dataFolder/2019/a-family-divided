Text: I come from a mother who had 6 children. 5 girls and one son....she was an alcoholic
  during the 80s and we were given to our mom mother by the time. I was 5 . My sisters
  were molested by my moms uncle who lived in the back.room of the house tbat we shared
  with him and grandma. We lived a normal and achieved life except some of mishaps
  in our household. As far i can remember my mother was a party goer....and my dad
  was in the army . I remember him always coming home from the war and callibg me
  Smurfette from the Smurfs and he would pick me up amd hold me with unconditional
  love but i new he knew my mother was up to things. I remember my grandmother cooking
  and cleaning and making sure we got off to school while my mother was still in jer
  drunken stumper ...  i remember helping my grandmother prepare meals while my sistets
  were out at the park and away from the house .i also remember my uncle always coming
  out of the room while my grandmother cooked. I hated seeing and knowing he was.there
  and knowing night time.was.upon us. I kept the secret to my self knowing i wantex
  to.express small gestures to my grandmother while baking biscuits but fera and doubt
  stopped it from reframing in my mouth. I endured love drom my grandmother because
  at the age of 5-7 we were in a home of filled with lies, sex and betrayed love .
  My innocence were taken at rge age of 5 ....( i need to tell more but it sometimes
  painful to.express my deelibgs because ive kept tjis bottled up for.over 30 something
  years ...please help me tell my story so i help someone like me ...
