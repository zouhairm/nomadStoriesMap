Text: "Before that morning, I had thought stories of a village beach a mere joke.\
  \ I had arrived in Sop Chem, a rural and humble village that prior Sunday to volunteer.\
  \ The boats had came right up to a mesh of land close to the bungalows in the village.\
  \ There was no beach, just wet ground as the river was almost on top of the fence\
  \ of the village's gardens. I was told the water level would gradually lower to\
  \ reveal a large beach as far as the next mountain, but I couldn't picture it in\
  \ my mind at the time. \n\nYet, there I stood in the morning wind, staring at a\
  \ vast amount of sand stretching as far as I could see, and I felt numb. I followed\
  \ Touy, a local guide, from the breakfast bungalow down the path through bamboo\
  \ trees and exotic flowers peaking towards the direction of the river.  As we emerged\
  \ from the bamboo garden, each step crunched under my feet over what was once a\
  \ pumpkin patch. I later learned,  the pumpkins would have been ready for harvest\
  \ that day, and now laid under my feet, a messy graveyard.  Touy walked slowly over\
  \ the dead pumpkins reaching the beautiful beach I didn\u2019t believe existed.\
  \ He stopped about a foot in front of the water and sat in the sand letting his\
  \ toes dig.  I followed and sat next to him listening to the calming river flow\
  \ in front of us.  The day we arrived the river was not calm like this.  It was\
  \ strong and harsh flowing fast and loud.  That was the day the Dam broke. It was\
  \ Dam number 4, and it took a week for the river to calm. \n\nThe Dams had destroyed\
  \ the village's pumpkin crops, but they had also given the village its first week\
  \ of electricity ever. Many of the volunteers had argued over the dams' presence\
  \ in Laos. Questions about corruption of modernity and the levels of poverty affecting\
  \ happiness had filled the last couple nights.  Some argued that the genuine nature\
  \ of happiness radiating in the village was a product of simplicity within the village\
  \ and modernity would kill that gem.  \n \nI resisted for a second, but finally\
  \ asked, \u201CTouy, are you mad that the dams are being built in Laos?\u201D  He\
  \ continued to gaze at the water for a long moment.  He scrunched his lips to the\
  \ side as if contemplating his response before surprising me, \u201CDo you know\
  \ why the river is brown?\u201D Perplexed at this response I took a moment to think\
  \ about mud or sedimentary rocks or other reasons, but before I could speak he continued,\
  \ \u201CThere is an old Laotian legend, telling the story of many villages living\
  \ harmoniously like sister and brother. The river was transparent as a crystal and\
  \ flowed through these villages with clear calm waters. The river\u2019s transparency\
  \ made it easy for the villagers to fish because you could see all the way to the\
  \ sand, all the fish and all the shrimp, every crab and every frog. You could see\
  \ all the rocks which made it easy for boats to avoid crashing or scraping tall\
  \ rocks. The people loved the river.  However, the rains began to get heavier and\
  \ heavier through the years and with a lack of water systems their homes and villages\
  \ would flood.  This caused many of their valuables, including gold and family heirlooms,\
  \ to be washed away into the river.  Now the people could see the rivers sparkling\
  \ with these treasures, and they began to fight over these material objects. They\
  \ became driven by greed and materialism instead of love and friendship. They had\
  \ lost their Lao way. Nalga who is the guardian of the river saw all this and was\
  \ saddened by the change in the Lao hearts. He wanted to help the people remember\
  \ who they were, so he decided to take away the temptation that was clouding the\
  \ people\u2019s hearts.  He clouded the rivers and tainted them brown taking away\
  \ any transparency that was once there along with the view of any treasures in them.\u201D\
  \  I paused before asking, \"Did they remember?\" Touy looked at me and smiled."
