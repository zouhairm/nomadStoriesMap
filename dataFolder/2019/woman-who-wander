Text: "Pretty, prayerful and powerful woman.  I met her way back in October 2011 when\
  \ I attended a conference at Bangkok, Thailand.  She has one of the lovely features\
  \ of a Pinay (Filipino woman) beauty.  Though petite in figure her looks could captivate\
  \ anyone who stares at her.  Little did I know that we belong to the same religious\
  \ community that time and she also resides on the same city in the Philippines which\
  \ is actually my hometown.  I easily get along with her because we worship and praise\
  \ the same God and she even prayed for me during one of our culminating activities\
  \ during the three-day Global Leaders\u2019 Summit though I know that she is also\
  \ in need of motivation because of her present condition.  Other than that, I learned\
  \ throughout our getting-to-know each other conversation that, she is also a colleague\
  \ of my travel buddy working on the same multinational certification company that\
  \ operates worldwide.  Only then that I realized how small the world is and how\
  \ vast are the opportunities present.  She instantly, became my partner because\
  \ of her strong personality showing what a modern Filipina woman is all about, someone\
  \ that is so resilient.\nThe conference ended too soon and we bid each other goodbye.\
  \  She goes back to her assigned European country that time while I went back to\
  \ the Philippines after my short side trip in Thailand.  A year after I heard that\
  \ she was back in one of their regional office assigned in Asia. We lost connections\
  \ then, I only get updates about this young beautiful lady named Joan through our\
  \ mutual friend and my local travel buddy, Drey.  She continued work on the same\
  \ company based in Singapore.  From her singlehood status she then marries and has\
  \ been very active on the same religious community I had known her involved.  While\
  \ I continued my corporate job in the Philippines, my passion for traveling is always\
  \ present.  From the time we separated I had been to seven countries and more than\
  \ thirty local destinations in the Philippines.\nYears passed, and I was invited\
  \ by my High School friend to visit Melbourne, Victoria Australia in spending the\
  \ holidays there for her birthday month which is October 2018.  This is my first\
  \ solo trip outside Asia.  I was excited and scared to embark on my literally all\
  \ alone trip.  As a female solo traveler I was too cautious of the activities I\
  \ would want to do and places I will visit in that continent.  I arrived on a Saturday\
  \ afternoon and got picked up at the airport by Jhu, my hospitable friend.  She\
  \ made sure I had a memorable short stay by driving me to Middleton Beach huts and\
  \ wine tasting in the vineyard with chocolate eating at the factory, encountering\
  \ the koalas and the kangaroos over her free weekends.  Then she brought me to the\
  \ city to be able to memorize the way around and get used to commuting on my own\
  \ because I would be doing it after her birthday when she goes back to work.  I\
  \ enjoyed seeing the iconic central station, riding the oldest tram, being in the\
  \ most fourth popular library, discovering the history and culture of the land down\
  \ under in their museum, admiring their street art and tasting one of the best coffee\
  \ in the world.  On my second to the last day I joined a group tour and experienced\
  \ the breathtaking coastlines of the Great Ocean Road.  \nBefore my second day ends,\
  \ I received a personal message from my social media account coming from that friend\
  \ I met in Thailand seven years ago.  It was Joan, who saw my tagged picture roaming\
  \ in Melbourne.  She has been residing for almost a year, its hundred meters away\
  \ from the place I am staying.  She invited me to have lunch with her family into\
  \ their home on my last day.  Little did I know that she already migrated to Australia\
  \ coming from Singapore right after she gave birth to her son.  I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find her again after meeting her seven years ago in Thailand, still the same\
  \ pretty, prayerful and powerful woman.  Likewise, I found myself wandering too."
