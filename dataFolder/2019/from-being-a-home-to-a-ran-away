Text: "To begin, I want to present myself a bit. I'm a student of Political Science\
  \ and before that I was two years studying International Relations. In one course,\
  \ i had to do a classwork about Yemen's unification war, and it was so surprising\
  \ for me when i saw, a couple months after, the sad situation they are living again.\
  \ \n\nMy travel story is not a novel or fiction, with this I want to tell the world\
  \ the real life of Yemen's citizens. The news are silent about it, at least in the\
  \ spanish ones is not usual to hear something about one of the worst humanitarian\
  \ crisis nowadays. I think that all the world needs to know what is happening there\
  \ because is the only way to touch their hearts and involve them, make them want\
  \ to help and be empathetic with others, information is the key.\n\nI want to guide\
  \ this travel story trough the eyes of the people who is suffering, the ones who\
  \ were before a house for refugees over the world and now need to be welcome (Yemen\
  \ was one of the best welcome countries for refugees before the big crisis in 2015).\
  \ \n\nMy idea is to find specifically a young woman, living in Yemen now, between\
  \ 18 and 23 years old and with conection with her relatives. I prefer a young woman\
  \ because I want to give the story a feminist  perspective  and empower the women,\
  \ to give them a space to raise their voices. Also, I wish to make something like\
  \ a class disscusion, because I think it's easier for richer people to have a place\
  \ in the mass media and these kind of spaces to  express themselves. \n\nI would\
  \ like to do a life story, since her first years of life until now,  since I think\
  \ it's the best way involve the people in the story and create a conection between\
  \ the character and the reader. Also make them see the way things can change in\
  \ a sigh  and the impotence when you realize that tou have nothing more to do against\
  \ it than fight for your life.\n\nI don't want  to say more because i think this\
  \ project, if I can make it true, is going to be a continued process and probably\
  \ the initial idea is going to be changed while we are writting. Meet people and\
  \ know more cultures change your mind and maybe tour preconceived ideas about how\
  \ you want to write others life."
