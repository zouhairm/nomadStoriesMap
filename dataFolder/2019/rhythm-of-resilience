Text: "My head is down, hands are in my pockets and my posture slouched, my body perfectly\
  \ representing my feelings of disappointment.  It is my last night in a city that\
  \ I have fallen in love with, in only a few days.  Whether it\u2019s the food, the\
  \ kindness of its people or the bright energy that seems to radiate off of every\
  \ corner, New Orleans has swept me off my feet. \n\nOn this last night, I had hoped\
  \ to catch another incredible show, but unfortunately the venue has a scheduling\
  \ issue and I have no plans for my last stop. Turning into the Latin Quarter, I\
  \ immediately feel a buzz of excitement stirring around me.  Trying to find its\
  \ source, I smell the beer being splattered on the pavement from plastic glasses\
  \ and hear the laughter that comes after every sip.  I begin to realize that the\
  \ excitement is building within a small crowd, right on the very corner that I\u2019\
  m standing on.\n\nThat\u2019s when I see them: a group eleven young boys carrying\
  \ tattered cardboard boxes and piecing together a scratched-up collection of brass\
  \ instruments.  It must be close to midnight and not one of these boys is older\
  \ than sixteen, but they are smiling and carrying themselves in a way that lets\
  \ you know that what they\u2019re about to do is going to be amazing.\n\nThe show\
  \ begins. I stand there for over an hour hypnotized by their performance. The trumpets,\
  \ the trombones, the drums, all together creating the best jazz music I\u2019ve\
  \ ever heard. What makes it so captivating is the laughter and the smiles that shine\
  \ through their unkempt clothing and worryingly thin bodies.\n\nStanding there in\
  \ the moist heat, with beads of sweat visibly dripping off of every happily, swaying\
  \ body around me, I realize that these boys represent everything that New Orleans\
  \ is: a city that has undergone tragic circumstances. A community living in poverty,\
  \ struggling to recover from having their homes torn apart. However, they are not\
  \ ashamed of their struggles. You see it in every aggressive crack in their sidewalk\
  \ and in every fallen tree that has yet to be removed. You see it on the worn-out\
  \ faces of the locals. They do not hide the poverty they endure because they are\
  \ proud of their strength to rise above it.\n\nDespite the hardships, the city is\
  \ vibrant and filled with colour. The people welcome you with warm smiles and offer\
  \ all the help they can give, whether it comes in the form of a cold glass of water\
  \ or going out of their way to escort you in the right direction.  This city has\
  \ the strength to welcome anyone and make them feel at home. They do not let themselves\
  \ be branded by the obstacles that they have had to overcome.\n\nI am able to see\
  \ all of this radiating from the group of eleven young boys, or better yet men in\
  \ front of me, pouring their hearts out into their instruments and into the crowd.\
  \ Their strength and their positivity even more intoxicating than the punch being\
  \ passed around.\n\nAlthough I had not expected it, there could not have been a\
  \ more perfect or natural way to end my trip. Once the performance ends and the\
  \ crowd naturally dissipates, and I head back to the hostel with my head held high,\
  \ feeling the rhythm of this enchanting city."
