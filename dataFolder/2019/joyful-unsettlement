Text: "My newlywed husband and I had arrived two days before to this country we knew\
  \ nothing of and were planning to drive the Ring Road in one week with our light\
  \ clothing and a car we\u2019d booked that was so small the wind could easily shove\
  \ it into the next lane. We were optimists, but the truth is we\u2019d never been\
  \ so unprepared for a trip in our lives. \n\tHaving left the crowded capital, we\
  \ ventured ourselves into the widely uninhabited island. We were following an exhaustive\
  \ guide we\u2019d found online while inserting a few stops on our own. The first\
  \ one was Selfoss, an average small city that also hosted the one and only Bobby\
  \ Fischer Center. This was a non-negotiable for me since the only memory I had of\
  \ my grandfather, who adored playing chess, was of one evening we spent together\
  \ and I asked him who was the best chess player in history. I still remember his\
  \ voice when he pronounced Fischer\u2019s name while sharpening my pencil colors.\
  \ I could see his face while standing in front of that green door waiting for an\
  \ answer but no one ever came. The museum had been closed for months. And I never\
  \ got to see it. \n\tWe moved on to see different waterfalls, each one more impressive\
  \ than the last one but at the end of the day I was mentally exhausted and wanted\
  \ to do nothing more than to arrive to our hotel and rest.\n\tMy finally warmed\
  \ up fingers had reached the last button of my upper pijama when the phone rang.\
  \ I picked it up and Marek\u2019s voice came right through: Hurry, you can see them\
  \ from the shore. They won\u2019t last long. I didn\u2019t need to be told twice.\
  \ In a matter of one minute we took our jackets and scarves, left our room, crossed\
  \ the reception -with Marek behind the desk giving us a thumbs up-, ran past the\
  \ narrow national route 1, a lonely gas station and a large area covered with plants.\
  \ We looked back at the sky. And there they were. Or were they? Francisco and I\
  \ were standing in the black beach of V\xEDk \xED M\xFDrdal in the South of Iceland,\
  \ looking at a thin greenish ethereal thread everyone was trying to get photographed\
  \ while clumsily taking off their gloves to set the tripod and shoot. Boy, was I\
  \ more thrilled by the cold stiffening my limbs. \n\tI turned around following the\
  \ sound of the waves and there it finally was. A sky so dark and thick you wouldn\u2019\
  t even dare to reach out to it just by the mere fear of being crushed by its immensity,\
  \ and at the same time a sky so generous filled with endless stars that allowed\
  \ me to perceive my silhouette so I wouldn\u2019t forget I still existed before\
  \ this greatness. I had never seen anything like it, not even in the most isolated\
  \ beaches of my home country. And I had never cried tears of what I could only call\
  \ a joyful unsettlement. Every planetarium I could think of looked ridiculous next\
  \ that Icelandic sky. This was the real planetarium.\n\tThe next days flew by quick.\
  \ How couldn\u2019t they? We drove through the J\xF6kuls\xE1rl\xF3n lagoon, H\xF6\
  fn, the east coastline and Myvatn, with the relentless worry of running out of gas\
  \ in the middle of nowhere. The last day we had to drive six hours non-stop to finally\
  \ reach Rejkjav\xEDk and catch our flight. And all I could think of was that thick\
  \ sky and how it made me feel in the beginning of this chapter in my life.\n\n\u201C\
  Yeah, well, it\u2019s all marketing,\u201D told me the freckled businessman sitting\
  \ next to me on the plane back home, \u201Cthey\u2019ve been planning this for years,\
  \ paying millions of dollars to marketing agencies to make Iceland an attractive\
  \ destination. It\u2019s all planned.\u201D He kept speaking for a while and eventually\
  \ went silent. It was fine. If they \u2014whoever they was\u2014 were entertained\
  \ juggling with words to get us there, they didn\u2019t know how much of a favor\
  \ they were doing to humanity. Or to me, at least."
