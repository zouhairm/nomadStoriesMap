Text: "After two train journey\u2019s through the neglected, yet charming villages\
  \ of south central Italy; we finally made it to Sorrento. We disembarked the train,\
  \ and whilst we couldn\u2019t quite see the ocean through the pastel coloured, coastal\
  \ architecture, the scent of salt permeated through the air suggesting a nearby\
  \ seaside. \n\nWhile, oftentimes challenges arise from traveling in such close quarters\
  \ with family, my parents and I have remained extraordinarily amicable, each bringing\
  \ our own strengths on our Italian escapade.\n\nMy mum, being the all-organised,\
  \ resourceful and well travelled women she is was left in charge of making almost\
  \ all arrangements, including accommodation and transportation. As my Dad and I\
  \ guarded our three bulging suitcases and watched the setting sun leak pinks and\
  \ oranges across the sky, my mum vigorously tapped at the numbers on her phone screen.\
  \ We awaited collection by our Airbnb host, Giuseppe, yet even after triple-checking\
  \ contact numbers and countless attempts to call, we were beginning to wonder if\
  \ we might have to bunk on the ground outside the station for the night. The day\
  \ was growing darker and our patience thinner with it, so my Mum began frantically\
  \ questioning locals for help, but most just grimaced at her in confusion, until\
  \ a friendly taxi driver understood our foreign vocabulary and pointed out the error\
  \ in country codes made when dialing. No longer displaced or destitute, we waited.\n\
  \nThe transfer to our Airbnb, came around the corner in the form of a tiny, ancient,\
  \ charcoal grey Citroen. I glared at the car in disbelief. How would we manage squeeze\
  \ ourselves and our excessive luggage into this vehicle? And will this gouged and\
  \ rusted wreck of a car stay together long enough for us to get to our destination?\
  \ Our host and driver, the infamous Guiseppe bounced out of the car, and welcomed\
  \ us the only way Italians know how... with generous kisses upon each cheek. Giuseppe\
  \ is a sweet, greying, older man, but he is a bundle of energy, cartoon-like and\
  \ animated. He hurls our bags into the miniature trunk and we play Tetris trying\
  \ to make them fit. With bags piled up around us, I awkwardly outstretch my arms,\
  \ one clutching the mass flattening my legs and the other behind me, holding the\
  \ handle of my own bag, in an attempt to save it from flying out of the trunk that\
  \ won\u2019t close. The back door flaps up and down as we take off along the cobblestone\
  \ streets.\n\n We begin to wind up a hill adorned with ramshackle houses, that similar\
  \ to the car have seen much better days. The brick fences and facades lining each\
  \ side of the laneways begin to encroach on us, making our passage slight and complicated\
  \ as we continue zig zagging up, rebounding uncomfortably across the unsteady pavement.\
  \ Giuseppe halts all too suddenly, instructing my Dad to wind down the passenger\
  \ side window and toss the collapsed and smashed side mirrors inside, that shockingly,\
  \ until now had been hanging melancholic by singular wires. \u201CNow\u201D he says\
  \ \u201CWe can squeeze through\u201D. My family and I laugh in disbelief at the\
  \ comedy of the situation, but cringe tensely as the sides of the car scrape grimly\
  \ against the decaying walls. Honestly, and we tried this later, with arms extended\
  \ our fingertips could touch each side of this absurd two-way street. \n\nA citrusy\
  \ aroma welcomed us, and was our light at the end of an all too slender tunnel,\
  \ as hidden amongst a vast lemon grove, would be our home for the next few days.\
  \ With rooftop views of sweeping cliffs and coastline to one side and the colossal\
  \ Mt. Vesuvius foreboding to the other, we felt spoilt and elated. Giuseppe, our\
  \ new comrade and self proclaimed tour guide promised us fresh homemade Limoncello,\
  \ and his wife Enza\u2019s Tiramisu. Giuseppe also insisted that we call him whenever\
  \ we needed another ride, needless to say we accepted only his offer of aperitifs\
  \ and desserts, and instead claimed we needed to walk, obviously in order to counteract\
  \ the considerable amount of Pizza, Pasta and Gelato we had been consuming."
