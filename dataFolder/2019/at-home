Text: "It is not about a story. It is about stories making one story.\nI came from\
  \ the South of France. An area where you can smell pines and sea everywhere. Anytime.\
  \ Even without being conscious of it. But when you are travelling, for whatever\
  \ reason, sometimes you feel at home and sometimes... it miss something. You maybe\
  \ don't know what is it but it is here all around you. Or maybe not! It happened\
  \ to me a lot - not feeling at home - I understand now that was because I could\
  \ not smell the direct, vivid light I was used to, I could not smell the dry grasses.\
  \ I could not feel the sun on my skin neither. People was walking fast. They were\
  \ not singing when they spoke. Or maybe it was just my own heart that did not dance.\
  \ What means being at home? Or better said, what means feeling at home? We are in\
  \ a constant moving world; we all are in mouvement. Changing of country and go through\
  \ frontiers for tourism, for work, because of love - in a broad sense -  or for\
  \ survival. And if feeling at home was not living in \"a home\", but a language?\
  \ A smell? A habit? A feeling? People around you? \nFor this travel story I will\
  \ not write about one country, but about the Mediterranean area. Where I felt -\
  \ and I feel - at home. As I said, several stories making one story. Different worlds\
  \ making one world. Different cultures walking together.  I would love to use different\
  \ ways of writing; poetry, narration, documentation, and different languages. Because\
  \ it is what we are. Different people living in the same, paradoxal world."
