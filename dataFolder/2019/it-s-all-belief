Text: "Imagine this : You're hiking on the rocky pathway through a village, passing\
  \ the rich paddy fields, enjoying the light breeze, and you come across a house\
  \ with a huge male phallus painted across it's walls. \n\nThis is exactly the first\
  \ thing I witnessed on my way to the Fertility Temple of Bhutan, or as they call\
  \ it - Chimi Lhakhang. Five more minutes into our trek and I had had plenty of views\
  \ of colorful phallus paintings, beautifully decorated with traditional designs\
  \ around it. Oh but that's not all, because as I progressed, I could see a few shops\
  \ with a huge number of wooden phalluses stocked inside. \n\nThe horror! \n\nWith\
  \ my mouth wide open, I ran my shy eyes across the walls and the shops, unable to\
  \ give a proper reaction. I was startled, yes; but also appreciative of how normalized\
  \ it was among the locals there. I just had to start a conversation about it. And\
  \ so I entered the shops.  \n\nA giggle here, a huff there, but by the end of our\
  \ little chat, I came out schooled about their tradition, as weird as it was. \n\
  \nIt was the saint Drukpa Kunley to whom this temple is dedicated. Very proudly\
  \ the shopkeepers told me tales of this revered saint who spread Buddhism in an\
  \ unconventional way through poetry, dance and sensual connotations, hence making\
  \ the phallus his symbol, indicating fertility and enlightenment.\n\nWho knew Buddhism\
  \ in Bhutan had such an unusual twist to it!\n\nThere is also a legend that the\
  \ mighty saint could fight the demons with his 'thing', also called the \"Thunderbolt\
  \ of Flaming Wisdom\" and turn them into protective spirits. This led to the belief\
  \ that it could ward off evil spirits, which is why the locals kept wooden phalluses\
  \ in their houses, apart from the phallus paintings.\n\nTalk about an interesting\
  \ souvenir!\n\nThe temple itself has a huge wooden phallus which is used only for\
  \ religious purposes. Couples from all over the world visit the temple to seek the\
  \ blessing of fertility. It might sound absurd to you - it did to me too, but hearing\
  \ stories of couples being blessed with a child after visiting the temple ruffled\
  \ my belief system. \n\nIt could be coincidence. Or maybe something more!\n\nThis\
  \ is the thing I love about cultures and traditions - as bizarre as they might be.\
  \ The strong faith that it engrains in the minds of their followers, is what I believe\
  \ the driving force behind the occurrence of miracles."
