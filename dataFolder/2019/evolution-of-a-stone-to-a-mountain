Text: "I along with my brother were running with our papers. Suddenly a call from\
  \ my uncle(my brother's father) and hasked him to come to Dubai to meet them. I\
  \ was feeling sad for not travelling overseas. I was keep telling my dad about going\
  \ to a foreign land. After few days Uncle asked me join with my brother. I was totally\
  \ excited to be a part of the journey. I started sorting out things and made a list\
  \ of necessities for my travel. Few days went my curiosity was increasing for the\
  \ trip. But there was a U-turn. I was not eligible to get the visa. I was totally\
  \ broken. I felt my day-dream got converted to a dream at night but who knows there\
  \ can be an another miracle in my journey. My dad and mom both decided to join the\
  \ trip and I was energised and became confident that there will be no more obstacles\
  \ in my journey. All of us applied for visa. During the processing of visa my dad's\
  \ visa was on hold. Everyone was sad. Again a hope broke and we were worried. My\
  \ dad was sad because his love for travelling was much more than me. If my dad wouldnot\
  \ get the visa we would drop the plan.\n We waited for few days and finally a good\
  \ news landed on us. Finally, we were all set to board for Dubai. All requirements\
  \ and necessities packed up. The day was knocking our door and we were all exited\
  \ to travel. This was the beginning of our journey.\n\nFirst we boarded to delhi\
  \ and then from delhi we took the direct flight to Dubai. There was an announcement\
  \ in plane that we reached Dubai and within few minutes we will land. I quickly\
  \ looked down to see the night view of the place. The place from top was looking\
  \ like glitters filled all around with stars passing by. The lighting was much sensational.\
  \ It took my breath. It was obsessed with the view. I was glad that we landed at\
  \ the best time I wished before. The beginning was a amazing experience.\nWhen I\
  \ visited malls specially Dubai Mall I felt like am doing my cardio. As everyone\
  \ knows Dubai Mall is the largest mall in the World. We just covered a small section\
  \ of it. I was much lucky to travell through the lift of Burj Khalifa. It was another\
  \ breathing feeling going to the top of the skyscraper. I felt am in world of peace\
  \ and harmony. It was another great feeling. We visited Palm Island, Hotel Burj\
  \ Al Arab Jumeirah, Ferrari World and the great Mosque. So ultimately we covered\
  \ up Dubai, Abu Dabi and Ras Al Khaimah which gave a throlling experience.\nAs a\
  \ matter of luck my uncle stays there so there was problem for accomodation. Our\
  \ other relatives were also living there so we had good get-togethers and good amusement\
  \ too.\n\nAfter all every journey comes to an end and begins with a new. \nWe returned\
  \ to Odisha and the very next day I had to sit for my 12th exams.\nThis was the\
  \ adventure, love and riak taking journey I came across.\nSoon I will get more of\
  \ it often."
