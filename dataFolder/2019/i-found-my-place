Text: "It happens to a lucky few. To find a place that makes you redefine the very\
  \ notion of place. To find a location that is far more than just that geographical\
  \ area, but also a time, a feeling, a sense of who you are and who you can be in\
  \ not just a given place, but your place. People travel to find their place in the\
  \ world and I found mine on the west coast of Ireland. \n\nThere is a drama to the\
  \ whole west coast that is heightened by the notoriously changeable weather. A sense\
  \ of unpredictability permeated through my two weeks of haphazard tramping down\
  \ the Wild Atlantic Way from north to south. The Wild Atlantic Way is a fitting\
  \ description that has been promoted by the Irish Tourism Board as the longest coastal\
  \ drive in Europe. Wild it certainly is. The wild and winding road twists through\
  \ the terrain that even the British Empire deemed too hazardous to take over. This\
  \ colonial neglect meant that the west coast has managed to preserve much of its\
  \ ancient culture. Gaeltacht regions are most plentiful here, where Gaelic is still\
  \ in everyday usage, a language that sounds as rugged as the jagged walls that separate\
  \ fields through counties Sligo, Galway and Clare.\n\nI reluctantly went through\
  \ these counties faster than I had planned, all through my first ten days I heard\
  \ from follower travellers who were going in the opposite direction that county\
  \ Kerry warranted an extra few days, and so I managed to enter this final county\
  \ with days remaining to take in what I could. I instantly understood the appeal,\
  \ the sign 'Welcome to the Kingdom' at the county border added to the sense of anticipation\
  \ and it didn't disappoint. My first day in Kerry was spent in Killarney, a town\
  \ that caters very well to tourists of all demographics. It doesn't have to try\
  \ hard as the lakes, mountains, waterfalls and rivers provide enough stimulation,\
  \ beds and food are all that's left for locals to provide, and they do so in abundance.\
  \  \n\nIt was further west though where I found something special. Between Tralee\
  \ and Dingle, in a place that is normally passed through I found one of those places\
  \ that I am reluctant to share in case it changes from increased interest, but I\
  \ have never been one to keep a treasure to myself. The place is called Stradbally.\
  \ It lies between the Slieve Mish Mountains and the longest beach in Ireland. The\
  \ local amenities include a bench, two pubs (one closed), a phone-box (obsolete)\
  \ and a gallery (thriving). \n\n\nAt first glance, this might not seem like much\
  \ but don't say that to the proud locals who endeavour to keep every inch of this\
  \ village clean and presentable for themselves as much as any visitor. The pub/\
  \ restaurant is Tomasins and this is the hub of the community. It has been run for\
  \ five years by Nick, a Chinese man who is very popular with locals and it is easy\
  \ to see why as he emerges from the kitchen to a cheer from the crowd congregated\
  \ around all manner of wholesome food and drinks. Nick has a word and a laugh for\
  \ everyone as he pours pints and serves both Asian and Irish food. \n\nAs the night\
  \ wears on a guitar emerges and it becomes apparent that there is more talent in\
  \ this pub than any reality TV show that claims talent. There are stories songs\
  \ and recitations that make the minutes turn into hours, the hours turn into days\
  \ and before I know it I have found a home. The locals learn my name, I learn their's,\
  \ I get offered a place to stay for cheap rent, I get offered a job in the local\
  \ school, I meet a partner whose company I enjoy more than my own and my four days\
  \ have turned into four years. I still travel and I write endlessly about the mysteries\
  \ of place and movement, but I am no longer searching, just exploring because I\
  \ have found my place."
