Text: "My eyes are filled with green. All hues of green. There\u2019s no room for\
  \ less, there\u2019s no room for more. I want to absorb it all but the night turns\
  \ the shades of green into silhouettes of grey and then black as the sun sets. We\
  \ have arrived for a study tour with a group of enthusiastic future architects and\
  \ while they put on upbeat songs and dip into the infinity pools of Heritance Hotel\
  \ in Kandalama Sri Lanka I tune into the feisty yet hasty chirp of birds and Grey\
  \ Langur monkeys as the sun sets. The rain-like shower is next to a fully glazed\
  \ transparent window. In my natural silhouette I let the water wash away traces\
  \ of moss, ferns and the scent of crab grass my bare feet had caught while walking\
  \ through the terraces of the hotel. I peek out to the nature showcasing hanging\
  \ vines and forest behind as the sun sets. I wake up to repeat to the same rare\
  \ experience and slide in another quick shower treat before we depart for Bentota.\
  \ The silhouette has turned back to green. \nMy students won\u2019t stop taking\
  \ selfies with a chameleon as still as a rock. \u201CDon\u2019t nudge it. Let it\
  \ be.\u201D the professor says, it\u2019ll change its color to protect itself.\u201D\
  \ I had seen nature do the same through my window, disappearing under the dark cloak\
  \ of night in the forest.  It is a six-hour drive from Kandalama to Bentota since\
  \ we will have to detour and get back on the main road as the travel guide describes.\
  \ Our drives are long and stops are short. The landscape is filled with towering\
  \ coconut trees and dense understory plants throughout the journey. \nEach night\
  \ we snooze and wake to a new context. There\u2019s a mosquito net over my bed at\
  \ Bentota. I have never slept under one before. It seems regal. I feel like a queen.\
  \  I guess that\u2019s not the intent though.  In the middle of the night I trip\
  \ over one of the hanging sheets of soft fabric gauze in my over excited mode of\
  \ shifting in and out of my regal mosquito tent. I snooze the night away beside\
  \ a self-adjusted bamboo pole detached from the ceiling and now crudely balanced\
  \ on a pillow. I wake up to the tremors of the railway shaking the windowpanes.\
  \ Another train just left for its destination from Bentota Railway Station ten kilometers\
  \ away from the resort. It\u2019s time to go. I don\u2019t feel like leaving my\
  \ dilapited mosquito net fortress.\nCharna the bellboy immediately gets the mosquito\
  \ net fixed when I hesitantly mention. I continue being apologetic to him and the\
  \ manager but they continue showing concern over why I didn\u2019t mention at night.\
  \ The conversion ends in an unresolved triumph over apology. They don\u2019t seem\
  \ to mind the tremors and errors of excited humans as long as the net keeps the\
  \ mosquitos out.\nCharna flashes his endearing ear-to-ear smile. I hand him some\
  \ of the rolled up currency notes exchanged at the airport. As beautiful as the\
  \ island itself these are in selected shades of vibrant green, amber, purple and\
  \ blue. I cannot help happily turning and flipping over both sides of the notes\
  \ zooming my eyes in and out of the details showing flora, fauna, historical landmarks\
  \ and adorable script of very similar rounded letters. \nI smooth out the remaining\
  \ ones back into my wallet, stow my bag under the front seat and tighten the loose\
  \ end of my seat belt. The plane is returning. This time my sub conscious leaps\
  \ back in time to lock all hues of green, sounds of nature and views behind the\
  \ mosquito net."
