Text: "I don\u2019t remember exactly what night it was. It could have been after an\
  \ IS rehearsal\u2014IS as in International Spice, my friend Violet Chai\u2019s theatre\
  \ company based in Nanjing. Not Islamic State, though I do still wonder what the\
  \ Chinese government thought when they did occasional surveillance of our \u201C\
  IS theatre\u201D WeChat group. Or maybe it was after we saw a kunqu opera performance\
  \ near Chaotian Palace; Ivy was always kind enough to organize getting tickets for\
  \ us foreigners because we were all illiterate in Chinese (obviously). \n\tRegardless,\
  \ one night in April or May 2018, as Nanjing\u2019s temperature warmed and the trees\
  \ bloomed from pink to green, my dear friend and coworker Napsugar suggested we\
  \ take a bike ride. Normally on school nights I often declined such invitations\
  \ because I had such early days compared to the other drama teachers at our company,\
  \ but that day \u201CI\u2019ll go\u201D slipped so easily past my lips. We mounted\
  \ our share bikes\u2014hers the orange MoBike and mine the white/blue HelloBike\
  \ as usual, and we often pretended we were in different bike gangs whenever we cycled\
  \ around the city, counting the number of other bike riders with our colors as we\
  \ weaved through the absolutely chaotic traffic of e-bikes and people spitting and\
  \ walking. \n\tNanjing at night is weirdly quiet. The crazy traffic slows down,\
  \ so you don\u2019t have the urge to swear at the other drivers for cutting you\
  \ off or making you nearly crash (or actually crash), though many can\u2019t understand\
  \ you anyways. At night people both recede into their homes or take nightly strolls\
  \ with their lovers, grabbing to-go food from street food vendors. Chinese people\
  \ are unpredictable. Nap and I flew down the streets, made random turns, enjoyed\
  \ the feeling of our legs pumping and the motion of creating our own wind in what\
  \ always felt like a different world no matter how many days I woke up to it. \n\
  \tI was following Nap. I hate to admit it, but I think I\u2019ve always more of\
  \ a follower rather than a leader. It gives me a lot of stupid anguish, but I have\
  \ to accept this truth about myself. Maybe my moving to China in the first place\
  \ was me trying to prove myself wrong in addition to typical post-graduation millennial\
  \ anxiety. To this day, I don\u2019t know if I ever did prove myself wrong. \n\t\
  But Nap is bold, brave, and decisive. We turned down an alleyway and quickly saw\
  \ this was not your typical city alley. I blinked, transfixed and thinking back\
  \ to memories of my Chinese New Year trip to India, specifically seeing the slums\
  \ of Delhi. Crowded, narrow, dirty, and quiet. Filled with debris like torn rags\
  \ and broken appliances and even an nonworking Minnie Mouse vending machine. In\
  \ India and now here, in Nanjing, I was again struck by my insane privilege in this\
  \ world. The money I made in China, my life in the States I left behind willingly,\
  \ and even my passport\u2019s country origin. I realized why I didn\u2019t like\
  \ to be in slum neighborhoods, and it\u2019s not because it\u2019s \u201Cdirty\u201D\
  : because I have never known it, I led a sheltered life, and for me to breeze through\
  \ here on a share bike and take it in is both important and invasive. \n\tTo so\
  \ desperately want to know, want to belong, is almost a form of victimizing myself.\
  \ How dare I not know people live like this. How dare I live the life I live when\
  \ people live like this. \n\tIt makes it about myself. And it\u2019s not about me.\
  \ It can never be about me in these moments. \n\tWriting about it, writing about\
  \ the baby I saw snuggled in the arm of its father by an open window where mosquitos\
  \ buzzed, writing about the couple I see putting a bed together in the center of\
  \ their hole-in-the-wall eatery where countless customers slurped noodles and picked\
  \ up vegetables from morning until night, writing about this does not change it,\
  \ does not enlighten you or me, does not even truly encompass the experience. \n\
  \t\u201CThis is the part of Nanjing we don\u2019t see,\u201D Nap said. \n\t\u201C\
  Yeah.\u201D And that was all I could say."
