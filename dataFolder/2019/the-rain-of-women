Text: "There wasn\u2019t a cloud in the sky. \u201CBring your umbrella,\u201D she\
  \ told me. I did as I was told and followed my host mother down the dirt road to\
  \ the Women\u2019s Ceremony in Kerepei Village. \n\nEvery other spring, women of\
  \ nine tribes on Maewo Island convene in a large bamboo hut by the sea and weave\
  \ colorful leaf mats, tell stories, and cook with the girls becoming women. For\
  \ 16 days, girls are fed from the gardens of their aunts, eating customary pieces\
  \ of pig and baking taro to steaming-perfection in lava stone ovens. They do not\
  \ bathe or brush their hair; the girls do not to leave the hut, but for one day.\
  \ On the 10th day of ceremony, the budding women dance into the village to receive\
  \ gifts and sacrifice a pig for each tribe. \n\nIn a society dependent on the skill\
  \ and devotion of women for most existential chores- the gardening, cooking, carrying\
  \ water, washing up, weaving, and child care- it is a jarring awareness to learn\
  \ that domestic violence and disrespect for women is abhorrently ubiquitous. It\
  \ wasn\u2019t always this way, though. In Vanuatu, an individual advances through\
  \ the hierarchical system based on virtue and character recognized by elders of\
  \ the village. In recent times, men have progressed to the 4th rank of \u2018Rasa\u2019\
  \ or \u2018high chief\u2019 but earned much higher rankings in generations past.\
  \ No one has made it to the 10th rank in hundreds of years, yet it is at this step\
  \ that the women\u2019s hierarchy begins- the 10th step is the first ranking of\
  \ women. Many leaders have forgotten this custom as society moves further away from\
  \ the ancient matriarchal system, adhering closer to a western patriarchy after\
  \ being colonized by Christian nations. My host father, the chief of our village,\
  \ and one of the most just and respected men I have ever met, tells this story to\
  \ anyone who misunderstands the role of women. \n\nThrough the many influences of\
  \ colonization, media, and tourism, much of daily life on the islands has changed\
  \ in the last 200 years. Magnificently, customs and ceremonies that connect tribes\
  \ with their ancestors, their wisdom, and their power, have prevailed. Long misplaced\
  \ but not forgotten, reverence for feminine power is elicited during the Woman\u2019\
  s Ceremony. Sitting quietly in the sun with my family to witness a new generation\
  \ stepping into their roles, we hear the gravelly voice of an old custom woman start\
  \ a song from behind banana trees. The coalition of tribes dances out of the forest,\
  \ singing songs sounding as if they emanated from the rocky core of the island;\
  \ hair garnished with red hibiscus flowers, wearing only woven leaf mats around\
  \ their hips. The timid young girls show burgeoning strength and duty, followed\
  \ by strong women who came before them and led by their resilient, brassy elders.\
  \ They march into the clearing and perform dances in rows before disappearing once\
  \ more into the forest. Not knowing whether the ceremony was over and never knowing\
  \ what will happen next, I sat under the mango tree listening to wind when from\
  \ the forest erupted another rhythmic song. Voices lifted high and strong shook\
  \ the birds off branches and sent chills down my spine. They stomped in unison,\
  \ holding time to the striking of hollow bamboo with a stick, and it started to\
  \ rain. The women continued to sing and emerged once more from the forest, heads\
  \ higher, taking up more space, owning their role in the tribe.\n\nNine pigs lay\
  \ tied up before the women. Heaps of beautiful mats were placed at their feet. One\
  \ by one, each new woman struck the pig with a club, the mats were gathered up,\
  \ and they retired back to the hut for six more days. As we prepared to leave, my\
  \ host mother said, \u201Cdon\u2019t forget your umbrella,\u201D I grabbed it before\
  \ standing and looked up at the beautiful blue sky."
