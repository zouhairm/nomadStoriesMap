Text: "My very first journey to over the sea.\n\nIn 2014, I had the opportunity to\
  \ study and travel in Singapore. I spent a month in Singapore, met many various\
  \ people, it all seems new to me who was the first time traveling abroad. My teacher\
  \ ever invited me to visit her house. The house neatly arranged with large glass\
  \ to make the room feel wider with its reflection. I was shocked when my teacher\
  \ mentioned the purchase price of her house, her house was small but the price was\
  \ equivalent to a large and luxurious house in Indonesia. At that time I just realized\
  \ how expensive the cost of living in Singapore.\n\nI am a Muslim when I was in\
  \ Singapore to coincide with the month of Ramadan when Muslims are obliged to fast.\
  \ It was a bit hard traveling when fasting, moreover, the temperature in Singapore\
  \ is hotter than in my cold city in Indonesia. Whatever with that thing, I was so\
  \ excited to explore everything about Singapore. Singapore is a small country with\
  \ three big areas of ethnic, Indian, Malay and Chinese people. I felt like traveling\
  \ to three countries in one country for one time. \n\nThe area of the majority of\
  \ Indian people is called Little India. I found the traditions of India, aroma of\
  \ spices, Hindu temples, flower garland, and also many Bollywood artist poster in\
  \ there, feel like in India country. I was so amazing with their culture, they keep\
  \ their tradition respectively and continuously. Look around the area and talk with\
  \ Indian happily was unforgettable moments. Moreover, how lucky a Muslim like me\
  \ had the chance to look around inside the Hindu temple. I think Hindus have many\
  \ gods when I saw so many statues inside the temple, but I was wrong, they just\
  \ believe in one God. \n\nDifferently, in Kampong Glam, the area of the majority\
  \ of the Malay community. I also discovered many ethnic and tradition of Arab in\
  \ there. Almost the people are Muslims like me. There is a big mosque in the center\
  \ of Kampong Glam, Sultan mosque. Same as like in my country, free food was provided\
  \ in Sultan mosques during Ramadhan. Every day the mosque was filled with Singaporeans\
  \ and travelers like me. Food had been divided into several spots and we could choose\
  \ where we wanted to sit. That was when I interacted a lot with Singaporeans and\
  \ travelers like me. Introducing yourself and exchanging stories is one fun thing\
  \ when meeting new people when traveling.\n\nMy last week in Singapore, I explored\
  \ Chinatown where everything about Chinese tradition seems in there. The character\
  \ word of China and red color everywhere makes Chinatown of Singapore seem like\
  \ china country. Chinese people are the majority community in Chinatown but also\
  \ in Singapore. How big Chinese community in this world. When I went to a very crowded\
  \ food court in Chinatown, I found some empty tables but nobody used it even though\
  \ the food court area was very crowded. Besides, many people were lining up but\
  \ not take a sit. I asked my Singaporean friend about the empty table. \n\nThe table\
  \ already has one, he answered.\n\nI was surprised with it because there was no\
  \ person except a tissue on the table. My friend explained the way the booking table\
  \ in the food court. It was unique, tissue on the table it indicates that the table\
  \ already has, look so funny but that's a simple way to book a table. Singaporean\
  \ highly values the culture of queuing orderly.\n\nMy experience of traveling in\
  \ Singapore had been a long time but I still remember it. I discovered the diversity\
  \ of ethnic in a small country like Singapore. Even though the area of Singapore\
  \ same as like province Jakarta in Indonesia, but rich with the diversity of language,\
  \ ethnic, tradition, and also tourism place. I felt lucky in my first traveling\
  \ aboard, I had chance explored India, Malay, and Chinese tradition just in one\
  \ country. A journey for three big nation in one time."
