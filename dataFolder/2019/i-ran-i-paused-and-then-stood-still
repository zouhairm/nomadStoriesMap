Text: "I was running, bored with the life I was leading. \nI was going on a one-way\
  \ ticket, few expectations and no idea about the place, my job and the people. \n\
  On 19th February, 2018, I flew to Siliguri and travelled to Gangtok; capital of\
  \ a state in the northeast of India. \nIt was the first time I was travelling alone.\
  \ I had taken a huge responsibility of teaching teenagers English, and I wasn\u2019\
  t ready for that kind of commitment. \nI had expected to teach kids during the day\
  \ and research about Sikkim after. \nI became friends with the children. I lived\
  \ in the school hostel; that made it easier to bond with the locals. These children\
  \ and my roommate, a local and a PhD student, became my primary support. \nThe people\
  \ of Sikkim are really simple and most of my students were going to be the first\
  \ generation in their families to finish school and graduate.\nWhen I had decided\
  \ to move to Sikkim, I assumed, I could find peace on the foot of the Himalayas.\n\
  The geography of the land is intriguing. It varies from mountains, to tall Himalayan\
  \ ranges, to plateaus. Where one mountain would end, the other would begin. The\
  \ houses are built on steps of slopes. One can find a variety of flora and fauna\
  \ in the small state, which is not larger than approximately 4000 sq.ft. The communities\
  \ aren\u2019t large, but they are diverse. Their occupations are humble; agriculture\
  \ and poultry is their bread. \nThere are three communities, predominant \u2013\
  \  Lepchas, Bhutias and Nepalis. The Lepcha Tribe was the first to settle. The Bhutias,\
  \ same community as the one in Bhutan, established the aristocracy in 17th century.\
  \ They ruled until 1974. The Nepali neighbours settled when the British needed cheap\
  \ labour. \nThey are very cohesive and protective of their own communities.  \n\
  I started understanding and speaking the local language Nepali. Children would speak\
  \ in broken Hindi, with a mix of Nepali, struggling to communicate with the teacher\
  \ from Mumbai! They were eager to make the 'outsider' feel comfortable. \nReligion\
  \ is uncomplicated. Lepchas are Animistic (nature worshippers), Bhutias are Buddhists\
  \ and Nepalis are Hindus or as per their beliefs. \nStrangely, they prefer to be\
  \ peace-loving and all inclusive. \nTaking the Lepcha community, for example, if\
  \ a child is unwell, they would go to a Bongthing ('shaman' in Lepcha) first, then\
  \ a Lama ('priest' in Buddhism) and then to a doctor. \nTheir belief in the nature\
  \ and it\u2019s forces is rooted firmly. They believe that the mountain God \u2013\
  \ Kanchenjunga, is a savior to all. When they pray, they pray for the family, the\
  \ community, and all human beings. \nThe land is untouched by modernisation. There\
  \ are pockets which are still maintained as reserves for the local tribes, where\
  \ access is only via road and there is no internet connectivity. That\u2019s where\
  \ I found my peace. \nOnce, the host there said to me \u2013 A homestay is not for\
  \ us to earn money, it is an effort by us to welcome you to our land. You must have\
  \ a good time, that\u2019s all we aim for. We are humble people and we want you\
  \ to enjoy with us like family. \nI learnt how to live like a guest then. I sat\
  \ in their kitchen, helping them cook; helping milk cows; having beers with them\
  \ during cold evenings. \nI had dropped everything I had. \nLiving in a strange\
  \ land makes you look hard at your life. Your solitude is your best friend and your\
  \ worst foe. It\u2019s the freedom you\u2019ve always wished you had, but, is difficult\
  \ to face when your expectations are not met.\nOnce I opened up, keeping my expectations\
  \ aside, I learnt, a lot! \nCulture is like a change of clothes; people remain the\
  \ same inside. Physical bodies, customs, languages do not determine the depth of\
  \ a life breathing in a human being. \nIf they were backward in a social setup,\
  \ they were like any other people. Their desires were same as everyone else \u2013\
  \ happiness. \nTravel opens you up in various dimensions. As random as I was when\
  \ I decided to move to Sikkim, it opened me up to life."
