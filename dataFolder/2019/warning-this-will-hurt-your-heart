Text: "Traveling in Bangladesh, one of the least explored and traveled countries in\
  \ the world, led to many challenging days. Getting from point A to B, or finding\
  \ out basic information or schedules was all quite challenging. My husband and I\
  \ spent the majority of one day in government offices trying to get a permit to\
  \ be allowed to visit the Chittagong Hill Tract, a remote area that requires prior\
  \ approval before accessing the area. We spent a large chunk of the day searching\
  \ for tourist agencies that no longer existed or if they did exist they couldn\u2019\
  t help us, they would simply give us someone else\u2019s number to contact.  We\
  \ finally made some progress but it was still unclear if we would make it to the\
  \ Chittagong Hill Tracts in the limited time we had left. We didn\u2019t want the\
  \ whole day to be about errands so we decided we would go visit one of the many\
  \ ship breaking yards that spot nearly sixteen kilometres of the coast just outside\
  \ of Chittagong, Bangladesh. Supertankers and giant cargo ships are broken down\
  \ to tiny pieces that are resold by shops set up along the roads. Labor is cheap\
  \ and environmental protection laws are practically non existent in Bangladesh.\
  \ The gargantuan ships are stripped by hand by thousands of workers risking injury\
  \ and illness due to toxic fumes, asbestos, chance of electrocution, and the list\
  \ goes on. Unfortunately and sadly many of these people working on these ships are\
  \ children, although the gated area with cement walls and chicken wire on top of\
  \ the fences protected by armed guards shows a sign that says no child labour. However,\
  \ when we visited (outside of the restricted area) there were so many young boys\
  \ around this mostly deserted part of town that there was no doubt that they worked\
  \ on the ships. We asked the boys if they worked on the ships and they said they\
  \ did. We asked for their names and they gave fake names such as \u201CMitchell\u201D\
  \ or refused to tell us their names. When we asked their ages boys that were clearly\
  \ no older then 10 or 12 claimed to be 15 years old. GreenPeace has tried to raise\
  \ awareness about these issues but this is an ongoing problem. This was so hard\
  \ and hurt our hearts but the boys energy and spirit was completely contagious and\
  \ awe inspiring. When I whipped out my camera everybody wanted their photo taken!\
  \ It was extremely difficult seeing children put into this position and knowing\
  \ there was little we could do about it. By visiting we hope to spread more awareness\
  \ to end child labour in Bangladesh."
