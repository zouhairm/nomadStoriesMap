Text: "-\tBosnian, Serbian, or Croatian?\n\nThis same question`s been chasing me around\
  \ for days, everywhere, ever since I got here a week ago, homeless, loveless, and\
  \ jobless.  Fun thing is, I`ve been the one to ask it first, but I couldn`t not\
  \ notice - road signs and motel branding, cafeteria menus and faculty names, even\
  \ some of the graffiti on the shacks, all united by this weird custom: to have the\
  \ same sentences and words written there three times, below each other, twice in\
  \ Latin, once in Cyrillic, almost like some native sayings. Turned out, according\
  \ to the law in Sarajevo, you were supposed to announce everything public in all\
  \ three official languages here \u2013 Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian. \n\n-\tAhem!\
  \ Girl\u2026 which type of coffee do you prefer \u2013 Bosnian, Serbian, or Croatian?\
  \ \n-\tJust some coffee, please\u2026  It`s the same coffee after all, isn`t it?\
  \ \n\nThe old, crippled salesman rewards me with a slight and gentle, almost imperceptible\
  \ smile, then walks away slowly, letting me explore and dig through bronze piles\
  \ of coffee pots, knives, tea spoons, lighters, tiny prayer boards, necklaces and\
  \ tawdry rings, Alladin lamps, rusty plates, toys, banners, souvenir guns, squirt-guns,\
  \ and fire guns. I could pick anything in a blink of an eye, put it straight in\
  \ my pocket without his depleted eyes ever pointing at me, but why would I, would\
  \ anything belong to me then? (\u201CYour Shahada would discover you, love, if only\
  \ you stop searching for it so desperately.\u201D That late-night acquaintance,\
  \ totally uncalled for, still stippling his words right through my exhausted mind.)\
  \ \n\nThe shopkeeper doesn`t have a clue about a single English word, yet he gets\
  \ what I attempt to say, as if he`d been my long lost western dialect grandpa. It`s\
  \ a common Slavic habit to pretend we do not understand each other in our mother\
  \ tongue. Not this time, though. Not in this thrift shop on Bascharsi. Not at 6:30\
  \ in the morning. A time for Fajr, not for pretence.  I`ve been awake for the last\
  \ 48 hours. After Srebrenitsa massacre gallery. After the National museum of Bosnia\
  \ and Herzegovina \u2013 \u043Enly open once a year, how lucky I am it happened\
  \ to be last night? That blue stranger man in the dark museum garden, with all his\
  \ stories. \u201CThis abandoned building? Hahha\u2026 It used to be a vegetarian\
  \ restaurant, only for a little while. Not our piece of candy. If this vegan you\
  \ ever tried our cevapi, you`d known exactly why.\u201D \u201CI`d never buy flowers,\
  \ not anymore. Not after my mother`s birthday when I came here to get here some\
  \ lilies, and there he was \u2013 the man who had slain my father, back then, so\
  \ cheery and chill, buying some lilies as well now. Yes\u2026  It all went back\
  \ to normal.\u201D \u201CYour Shahada would discover you, love\u2026\u201D. \n\n\
  My coffee arrives from the shaking salesmen`s hands, along with a small bronze spoon\
  \ that turns out to be a gift. He claims, all in Bosnian, our former president visited\
  \ the thrift shop a while ago and had been by him treated to the same coffee, with\
  \ the exact same spoon. And I get it. (We all read through our minds here in the\
  \ Balkans. Don\u2019t tell anybody.) Who cares if it`s true, when it makes a story.\
  \ I hold down this sudden urge to hug and old crippled Muslim man, finish my last\
  \ sip of coffee and walk out\u2026 To feel the city waking up, mosque by mosque\
  \ and church by church. The city that awakened me. \n\nBascharsi is coming to life.\
  \  Pigeon flocks around the tubular fountain, a key visual to so many postcards.\
  \ That same florist is opening his store down the street, without any Yugo war vet\
  \ customers yet. The first burqa girls laughing alongside their half-naked besties.\
  \ And the white tombstones in the middle of the city center, so typical all-around\
  \ Sarajevo. Blindingly bright. Awfully silent.  In one language only. Back then\
  \ in 1994 all those boys have been younger than I am now. All dead and gone.  Bosnian,\
  \ Serbian and Croatian. \n*** \nThree years have passed. Homes, loves and jobs.\
  \ I still stir my coffee with that bronze spoon.  My Shahada is yet to find me."
