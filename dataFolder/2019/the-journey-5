Text: "The bus was filled with local farmers that were on their way to the next village,\
  \ which lay forty kilometers away. The bus stopped, the driver looked at me, grabbed\
  \ me and my backpack and threw us on the road. Thousands of thoughts were running\
  \ through my mind and I must admit I was scared to death. What was I thinking? Is\
  \ it really such a great idea after all? Before I could even turn around to change\
  \ my mind the bus was gone.\nI looked around and found myself, all alone, in the\
  \ middle of a hillside with a breathtaking view. High mountains rose out of the\
  \ earth, covered with green jungle, as far as you could see. My eyes found the wooden\
  \ sign that said \u2018Forest Monastery 2 km\u2019 and an arrow leading into the\
  \ forest and mountains ahead. The forest seemed endless and swallowed all light\
  \ from the sun. The journey led me further and further into the woods. The only\
  \ sound I heard was coming from my feet, hitting the ground with shaking steps.\
  \ I stumbled over tree roots and felt lost. My hands started to sweat, and my breath\
  \ got heavier with every step. All the feelings that had led me to this place came\
  \ boiling up. All the loneliness and frustration, the feeling of never being good\
  \ enough, overwhelmed me as all the baggage I have put on my shoulders weighed down.\
  \ All the scars life left, which I thought would have been healed, were opening\
  \ up again. I wondered how it happened that I did not remember the sound of my own\
  \ laughter anymore. \nWhy was I so unhappy, when materialistically I had more than\
  \ most people? Why do I always feel so different? Why do I always feel as I do not\
  \ belong here? Why is the opinion of other people so important to me? Why are people\
  \ judging me all the time? Why do I always try to make other people happy and forget\
  \ about myself? Why can I not feel any love or kindness? What is it that I am missing?\
  \ Mom always told me; I should be happy and thankful, as I have everything. \nFrom\
  \ the outside I had everything, but it was my inside that left me feeling empty\
  \ and isolated. \nOn the brink of giving up and feeling my inner demons taking over,\
  \ I found myself at the entrance-gate to the monastery. Caught up in my thoughts\
  \ I did not realized where my feet carried me. They seemed to have known the way\
  \ all along. I could not believe that I made it and felt happy and anxious at the\
  \ same time. Hesitantly I weighed my options on what to do. Either stay in the forest,\
  \ with everything what is familiar to me, or conquer my fears and take the risk\
  \ of the unknown. Going back was not an option. \nWhen I stepped over the threshold\
  \ it opened a whole new world, I never knew existed. Immediately I could feel a\
  \ change. Wandering around, I admired the vibrant life of nature. There were several\
  \ paths, carefully framed with fallen flowers, stones and woods, waiting to be explored.\
  \ Birds were singing. The sun was shining on a field of bright pink, yellow and\
  \ red flowers. A river flowed down from the mountains and filled the air with the\
  \ familiar rush of cold water. Everything seemed to be in perfect harmony and balance.\
  \ I felt nature was speaking to me, telling me everything will be fine and that\
  \ I must only open my eyes to see the undeniable and breathtaking beauty of life.\
  \ I felt this place was meant for me. The monastery would be my home as long as\
  \ I needed to stay; to heal, to find my way back to myself, to my passion and happiness.\
  \ I never expected to find an experience that would change my whole life forever."
