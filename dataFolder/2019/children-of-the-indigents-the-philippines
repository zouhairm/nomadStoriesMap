Text: "A month under the roof of a struggling family. A month without my regular privileges.\
  \ A month of discomfort. This circled through my head for weeks before I embarked\
  \ on a journey to help local businesses in an island coined Bohol.\n\nThe two young\
  \ daughters of this family hosting me had quirky personalities. The older one had\
  \ slick black hair and dimples perfectly arched in her cheeks. Her milk teeth were\
  \ clearly infected with cavities from the excessive consumption of cheaply made\
  \ sweets and the absence of those very dentist visits every one of us despised as\
  \ a child from any ordinary family. She would pass these comments here and there\
  \ that would explicitly address their living standard. \"Oh we are very poor\",\
  \ \"I want to grow up and help my family\", she would say without any sign of embarrassment.\
  \ \n\nThen there would be the parents doing their best to hide their difficulties.\
  \ \"Oh their father was just busy with work\", the mother explained after I questioned\
  \ why the kids missed their first day of school. It was later from her conversations\
  \ with her neighbours was I able to put the pieces together. The girls had to skip\
  \ the day they had been anticipating for so long, the day these kids could reunite\
  \ with their friends, the day that meant they could start learning new things everyday\
  \ again, all out of their circumstances. The parents could not afford the stationaries\
  \ and books the girls needed for their classes. A new day came and went but there\
  \ was no school for the girls. This went on for a while but the mother promised,\"\
  \ Don't worry. They will go next week and join their classmates. Right, girls? Are\
  \ you excited?\" \n\nThe slightest mention of school got the girls pumping and nobody\
  \ could stop them from the series of events that followed. The usual hopping up\
  \ and down which would then break into a dance that they learnt in school being\
  \ in the dance team. All of these incidents made me highly aware of their passion\
  \ for learning and simply being students but never was I actually emotional until\
  \ one night after dinner. \n\nThe parents had left to visit their neighbours like\
  \ they would every few days. It was just me and the girls reading some short stories\
  \ they had borrowed from their school. \"Yay, good job girls!\", I exclaimed as\
  \ they finished up sharing and pulled out blankets to put them to bed. \"No we want\
  \ more please please please!\" they both shrieked in synchronisation. I was amazed\
  \ witnessing their enthusiasm and allowed them to grab more but they returned empty-handed.\
  \ They had finished up all the books they had brought from school and did not know\
  \ what to do. \"It's alright girls. We can read more next time.\" \"We love books\
  \ so much. You know, even if our family have no money, we cry and say please please\
  \ we want books.\", the older sibling replied to me trying hard to get her message\
  \ across, conscious of her broken English. She said it in such a genuine manner,\
  \ disregarding the fact that I am after all a stranger coming from a completely\
  \ different world in Hong Kong and would never relate to her or her family. I heard\
  \ my heart clenching and I knew whatever I said would not make a difference to their\
  \ financial position or ease any sort of tension.\n\nTo this day, the girls pop\
  \ up in my head every time I am about to throw an item away, questioning myself\
  \ if what I am about to add to the countless landfills could make someone's day,\
  \ could add convenience to their life, could mean so much more to them than just\
  \ another piece of thrash. I now have a huge bag of clothes and books in a corner\
  \ of my room that I know would make a difference to the underprivileged."
