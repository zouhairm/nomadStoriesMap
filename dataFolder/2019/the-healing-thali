Text: "With a metal thali of buttery rice, vegetables in masala spices and a hearty\
  \ soup of lentils on our laps, we suddenly forgot our aching legs. The sun was setting\
  \ on the mountain before us, scattered with lights as others lit up their small\
  \ self-built homes. Our fire flickered as we ate this wholesome offering with our\
  \ hands. And as the crickets crescendoed around us, serenity began to set in, as\
  \ we considered how our unexpected day had unfolded and led us here.\n\nWe had hopped\
  \ on a garishly bright multi-coloured bus from Kathmandu towards a small town called\
  \ Gorkha, in the centre of Nepal. With no prior expectations, we peered tentatively\
  \ out of the window as our bus took us out of the bustling city into the hot jungle\
  \ of Nepal. The bus veered up mountainsides, skidded around tight corners and led\
  \ us close to the road edge, towards certain death, several times. But the scenery\
  \ was undeniably beautiful. We saw deep valleys and high ranges, passed through\
  \ cloud as though in heaven and through beeping horns and traffic jams as though\
  \ in hell. Loud bhangra music played throughout, as people got on and off the bus,\
  \ squeezing us in and then releasing us again. All we knew was that we were heading\
  \ to Gorkha, to meet a man who was taking us to his family home, where they had\
  \ kindly said they would put us up for a few weeks. And we were excited.\n\nHopping\
  \ out of our wild rollercoaster bus, we found a small town, high up, filled with\
  \ noise and people, but with the quaint quietness of being so far away from anything\
  \ else. We strolled around with the monkeys, snacked on samosas and sweet sticky\
  \ things from vendors and looked out over hundreds and hundreds of rice fields.\
  \ When we found our connection, we were relieved. We were here. With our heavy backpacks\
  \ on, we laid them down and took a sigh. But only for a second. \n\nIt was time\
  \ for a challenge.\n\nOur new friend tells us we are headed an hours walk away to\
  \ a village called Nareshwor, through the mountains of Nepal, 3000ft up. With our\
  \ backpacks. Sometimes motorbikes can go some of the way, he tells us, but monsoon\
  \ season has made walking the only possible way to get there. \n\nWith food in our\
  \ belly, we set to it. With a spring in our step, we decided to embrace the sweat.\
  \ About 10 minutes in, we all looked as though we'd jumped in a pool. But as we\
  \ continued on, the crickets chirping, birds singing, greenery all around, it starts\
  \ to feel like paradise. The heaviness of the backpack weighs down on us physically,\
  \ but mentally we're all feeling much more free. No phones, no connections, just\
  \ this nice new green world of ours.\n\nAfter 50 minutes, some of us are struggling.\
  \ The ground is uneven and many hills are ahead of us. But we push on through, until\
  \ we find a small hidden path, leading down the mountain through the jungle. We\
  \ follow it, until we get to a clearing. A wooden house is before us, with a wide\
  \ cobbled courtyard. There's a fire, with something bubbling. And there's several\
  \ goats running around. \n\nThe owners of this new found place come out to meet\
  \ us, with big hugs. We can't understand each other very well, so our new friend\
  \ translates. But we're all smiling. What aliens we must seem to them!\n\nAfter\
  \ a hose down and change of clothes, we sit to eat our first meal with our host\
  \ family. A traditional Nepalese thali. And as we tuck in and listen to this rich\
  \ jungle, filled with noise and yet so quiet, we begin to realise what an serene\
  \ and exciting experience we are going to have here."
