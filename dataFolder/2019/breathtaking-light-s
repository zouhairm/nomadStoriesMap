Text: "First time on the subway to Manhattan. Oh I couldn't wait . Everyone from New\
  \ York warns say \" If your not from N.Y I wouldn't walk the streets alone. They\
  \ can smell fresh meat!\" Haha I challenge the streets, I had to see the Lights.\
  \ My stop is only a few away and I'll be at 42nd St. My heart is pounding yes but\
  \ not from fear, no. I am going to go see  something my mother or family never got\
  \ to see. Ill get to live it for her tho. People may think. Oh what's so great about\
  \ about N.Y and What's so special about the lights? but if seen where we come from\
  \ you would understand.  \nThe train slows and I stand from my seat as if I own\
  \ the place. Waited till it stopped and marched my way out of that train with my\
  \ head held high just like everyone else. People speeding past me left and right.\
  \ Sounds of music coming from a distance. The smells of food warm my nose as I move\
  \ deeper into the sea of people. I see a sign that says to the street and so I fallowed.\
  \ My surroundings become a blur as I daydream of what it would be like if she was\
  \ here with me. Locked in arms we share this moment together. Sadly it was just\
  \ me but as I climbed that last step and looked ahead of me I could see them. All\
  \ of them. A world of open doors of art and culture. My whole life all I ever wanted\
  \ was to protect her and my siblings and give them the world and this place was\
  \ Everything we could have imagined but she's gone and now  I am standing in the\
  \ middle of the lights and as a tear ran down my face I whispered we made it mom,\
  \ Its beautiful isn't it? And as I stood there I made a pact with myself to always\
  \ make the best of every moment with your loved ones and when they are gone remember\
  \ them as if they are there still. Our memories are our immortality so Forget them\
  \ you never will.\nAlot of people take things for granted and I often envy cause\
  \ id give the world to be with my family again but instead. I must see the world\
  \ without them. Every new spot I travel I always find the lights its a sign of hope\
  \ and maybe just maybe they can see the lights too. I recommend going to Manhattan\
  \ its very beautiful and if you are like me you will enjoy it too. Please remember\
  \ to make the best of every moment cause you never know what memories you miss out\
  \ on. So yeah Thats my story. Sorry its not the best but honestly I really don't\
  \ have any none depressing ass stories. Yes I have traveled but along these travels\
  \ have been some real dark moments but I hope I can win this and be able to write\
  \ a very amazing story. I am very down to earth but I am street smart as well as\
  \ book smart. I am mostly self educated and give been on my own since 15. Ive had\
  \ a hell of a life and if you get to know me I think ill be more then what you want\
  \ for this project and hopefully many more to come. Please give me a shot. Email\
  \ me a [email\_protected] or [email\_protected] and you can message me on Instagram\
  \ at Lilfangs88. My telephone number is 828-320-4329 Thank you for you time and\
  \ patience. I am sure you get alot of whack jobs doing this lol. I can only imagine\
  \ the stories you have probley read.\U0001F61D You have to let me hear the worst\
  \ one. Ok well I am literally running out of things to say so I can get you the\
  \ 700 you have asked for so I will bid you one more farewell and I hope to hear\
  \ from you soon and remember I want to hear a crazy story that you have read you\
  \ don't have to share the name. Is that a deal?sweet! \U0001F601\U0001F61D\U0001F601\
