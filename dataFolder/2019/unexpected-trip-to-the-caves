Text: "Exhausted after making my way through those 100  stairs I entered the Elephanta\
  \ caves which looked like a paradise from the sea we had to travel over a boat to\
  \ get there. The Grand cave with a hall (Mandapa)is the largest and is 130 Sq.ft\
  \ deep from the entrance to the back. As I walked past through it localit\xE9s and\
  \ foreign tourists surrounded the area clicking pictures in the most unusual poses.\
  \ Elephanta Caves contains rock cut stone sculptures that show the syncretism of\
  \ Hindu and Buddhist Ideas and iconography. You can also find sculptures of Shiva-Parvati,\
  \ Mount Kailash, Ardhanarishvara( a half-Shiva, half Parvati composite), Sadashiva\
  \ Trimurti, Gangadhara(Shiva bringing Ganges River to earth), Wedding of Shiva,\
  \ Shiva slaying Andhaka, Yogishvara, Linga(Shiva Linga shrine inside the cave complex),\
  \ In the East Wing Shrine you can find sculptures of Kartikeya, Matrikas, Ganesha,\
  \ Dvarapala(gate guardians). Yogishvara and Nataraja(God of dance-Shiva) are located\
  \ in West Wing Shrine. Apart from the sculptures, there are wild monkeys who are\
  \ kind enough to pose for photos and rude enough(they are not trained monkeys) to\
  \ take your belongs/food unattended or right under your nose.\n\nLet's back it up\
  \ a bit on how I ended up going to the Caves. How often do you meet someone who\
  \ is interested in your life without even knowing you personally? There I was standing\
  \ in the queue deciding where to go next and make it a memorable day until it was\
  \ my turn. Standing there clueless of where to go the Staff at the ticket counter\
  \ goes: Hey, How are you? Where are you off to today? Baffled I say I will go to\
  \ Dadar. He laughs and tells me you went there yesterday. Why don't you try Elephanta\
  \ Caves it is in Churchgate you have to go to the gateway of India and from there\
  \ to catch a boat to this island where the Elephanta caves are. Excited to hear\
  \ my journey planned out I take the ticket and wait at the platform for the next\
  \ express train to arrive. \n\n\nForcing myself into the chaotic rush general compartment(you\
  \ will know when you visit Mumbai and travel by train)my day had a fantastic start.\
  \ By the time we reached the last stop, I managed to score a seat and had already\
  \ informed my aunt about my whereabouts, and my itinerary for the day. As we arrive\
  \ I rush towards the bus heading to the gateway of India which is another grind\
  \ considering you are new to the place, and it's your first time traveling alone\
  \ without a proper plan. Lucky for me I had my way as I could speak and understand\
  \ the local language the conductors were quite helpful in guiding me to the right\
  \ bus. On inquiring about the gateway of India I reach there to find out a huge\
  \ line followed by the security team frisking people as their belongings went through\
  \ the baggage scanner. On entering, you will be approached by many boatsmen calling\
  \ you to travel with them in their ferry boats to Elephanta Island. It is 45-60\
  \ minutes ride one-way. On your way, you will find Seagulls flying beautifully in\
  \ a synced manner whom we were not supposed to feed any eatables which the boatsmen\
  \ have strictly mentioned as they can be quite a disturbance. Along with me were\
  \ a bunch of people were visiting Mumbai for their friend's wedding all the way\
  \ from the U.K. they were quite a fun interactive set of people who bonded, clicked\
  \ photos and made the ride bearable both the ways. On reaching the island, you can\
  \ see counters to enter the place and in about 100 meters you will find a long flight\
  \ of stairs (approx. 100-200 stairs) before you actually enter the cave entrance.\
  \ As you move upwards you will see many stalls with miniatures, toys, handicrafts\
  \ made of clay and wooden work items and about 20-30 people screaming 'come here'(that's\
  \ the olden ways how people tried selling items for sales). With 3 stopovers we(the\
  \ group tagged along) finally reached the entrance to find another counter and hopefully\
  \ the last one before we actually entered the most awaited Caves."
