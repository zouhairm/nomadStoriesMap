Text: "So it\u2019s a Friday night. My roommates and I are all writers; the kind of\
  \ girls that like to be in bed with their cat and Netflix by 8 PM. It\u2019s safe\
  \ to say Fridays aren\u2019t really our thing. However, we\u2019re also study abroad\
  \ students in Dublin. None of us know much about Ireland, but coming here is, collectively,\
  \ our last ditch attempt to be spontaneous, adventurous, going-out-at-8-PM people.\
  \ We don\u2019t really know how to make this happen yet.\n\nWe\u2019re all talking\
  \ about what Netflix show we\u2019re going to watch tonight when our neighbor comes\
  \ over and says, \u201CLet\u2019s go to a pub\u201D. We all look at each other nervously,\
  \ waiting for someone else to talk first. Are we really doing this?\n\n\u201CSure,\
  \ why not?\u201D someone says. \n\u201CSounds fun.\u201D\n\u201CLet me grab my bag.\u201D\
  \n\nWe\u2019re in Ireland. That\u2019s what you do in Ireland; you go to a pub on\
  \ Friday night.\n\nThere\u2019s a pub just down the street from our apartment building\
  \ in the Liberties. It looks exactly how someone who knows nothing about Ireland\
  \ would expect a pub to look; dark wood paneling accented with gold paint, flower\
  \ baskets hung from the roof, old double doors, MCCANS BAR across the front accompanied\
  \ by the word GUINNESS. We\u2019d seen these pubs in movies; warm and bustling with\
  \ locals and musicians. This seems like the perfect pub for us. We push through\
  \ the front doors.\n\nThe first thing we notice is the quiet. There are gruff, old,\
  \ Irish men scattered across the small, dimly lit space and none of them are talking.\
  \ A TV plays horse racing statically in the corner, a bar keep jostles glasses in\
  \ a sink, and all of them are just turned towards us, staring.\n\nWe apprehensively\
  \ take a small table in the far corner of the bar.\n\n\u201CDidn\u2019t know it\
  \ was lady\u2019s night,\u201D we hear one of them say under their breath.\n\nWe\
  \ look away and sip at our beers, talking quietly. The bartender goes over to his\
  \ CD player and turned on Ladies from the 80s over the bar speaker. The old men\
  \ are visibly affronted by this.\L\nWe finish up our pints and leave almost as quickly\
  \ as we came, saying thank you on our way out the door and blushing. \n\nWe had\
  \ learned a valuable lesson that night: not all pubs in Dublin are the same, and\
  \ it is important to know your pubs.\n\nListing all the pubs in Dublin is like reading\
  \ a Dr. Seuss book. There are seedy pubs, and traditional pubs, and tourist pubs,\
  \ and family pubs. There are techno pubs and gay pubs and latin pubs and trad pubs.\
  \ Some pubs turn into 21+ night clubs on weekend nights, and some pubs are restaurants\
  \ for all ages, any time. \n\nThe pub we had gone to was not for us. It was a pub\
  \ for blue collar, local men to visit night after night, and talk to each other\
  \ after a long day of work. And odds are, it would not be for you either. So how\
  \ do you find the right pub for you?\n\nFirst of all, consider location. Pubs near\
  \ the city center are welcoming to everyone. Pubs further away are probably more\
  \ local. Pubs near tourist hotspots like Trinity College, Temple Bar, and Grafton\
  \ Street are bustling, but quite pricey. Try looking into the bars just off R137,\
  \ west of Trinity. There are also lots of great pubs on the south side of St. Stephen\u2019\
  s Green and to the west of Iveagh Gardens. \n\nSecondly, consider clientele. What\
  \ sort of people do you see inside? Are they mostly tourists? College students?\
  \ Families? Locals? You can tell a lot about a pub by who is coming in and out.\n\
  \nAnd lastly? Don\u2019t do what we did. The Irish are known for their friendliness\
  \ and candor, but it\u2019s important to read the room. Visit new places and make\
  \ some memories, but don\u2019t intrude. Do yourself a favor and do a little research.\
  \ Even adventure and spontaneity benefit from a little guidance."
