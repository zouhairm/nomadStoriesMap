Text: "Sitting on a sandbank, watching the emerald blue waves crash on the sand below\
  \ me, there really is nothing that comes close to this feeling. Frigate birds circle\
  \ overhead, expertly showing off their acrobatic skills, each one trying to out-maneuver\
  \ the next. Behind me, a caracara dives down on its unsuspecting victim. Paradise.\
  \ Golden beaches stretch for over a kilometer, surrounded by jungle and mangroves,\
  \ home to a multitude of wonderful creatures. Many people dream of this moment,\
  \ and here I am, living this moment.  \n\nThe afternoon sun slowly subsides, welcoming\
  \ nighttime. The mangrove erupts with sound. The creatures that hide away during\
  \ daylight hours now emerge, using the cover of darkness to evade predators or catch\
  \ prey. One sound dominates all. Cicadas. These large insects are made conspicuous\
  \ by the courtship calls of the males, filling the void around me. Geckos scurry\
  \ around above me, waiting to pick off any flying insects that stray too close to\
  \ their hungry jaws. \n\nWe arrive at the beach. The stars brilliantly lit up the\
  \ sky is a dazzling display. With no artificial light for miles around, the intensity\
  \ of the night sky was just magical. Late night crept into early morning. We already\
  \ had two green turtle activities, but nothing exciting. Just a few attempts of\
  \ body pits, before accepting defeat and lumbering herself back into the ocean void.\
  \ As we move along the beach, cloud formations develop way above, threating rain,\
  \ Lightning flashed, illuminating the beach. An olive-ridley emerges. Hulking her\
  \ cumbersome body up the sandy slopes, she attempts a body pit in the vegetation.\
  \ No good. 5 attempts later, she finally finds a suitable place to deposit her developing\
  \ offspring. 67 ping-pong ball like eggs drop into the newly formed hole. With all\
  \ sea turtle species threatened with extinction, these 67 eggs are as precious as\
  \ gold. All hands to deck. Measurements and skin samples are taken for analysis.\
  \ We sit back, content with our work and marvel at this incredible animal as she\
  \ hauls herself back to the ocean.\n\nAfter a successful tagging on an olive-ridley,\
  \ we set up camp at a vantage point on the beach. There is no moon, and jungle looms\
  \ over us on all sides, creating a darkness that is oddly relaxing. Periodic flashes\
  \ of green light up behind us. Fireflies. Blue light shimmers in front of us with\
  \ each breaking wave. Bioluminescence. I'm in awe of the landscape around me. It's\
  \ like we're a million miles away from civilisation. The sound of a passing vehicle\
  \ drifts in the breeze, and the illusion is swiftly shattered. In reality, there\
  \ are very few natural places, isolated from man's destruction, left on Earth.\n\
  \nThe golden beaches illuminate the turquoise water, yet I am impervious to the\
  \ beauty of the scene. A green turtle lays motionless in the surf. A huge hook protrudes\
  \ from her mouth. She is undeniably dead. Unable to feed, she slowly starved to\
  \ death. Perhaps snagged on a longline hook typically designed for big fish. The\
  \ paucity of patrol boats makes enforcement impossible. Longline fishing is one\
  \ of the greatest threats to turtles, pushing them ever close to the brink of extinction.\
  \ This unnecessary waste of life, coupled with the threat of poaching is making\
  \ conservation very hard. Typically, olive ridley eggs are eaten with a special\
  \ sauce and finished with a beer by local men as an aphrodisiac. This poaching continues\
  \ to happen, with locals believing that turtle eggs are an inexhaustible resource.\
  \ Due to this, we are forced to relocate every nest we work. Battling swarms of\
  \ sand flies, mosquitos and flying sand, we remove the freshly deposited eggs to\
  \ be transferred to a safer location, out of reach of El hueveros. \n\nOf course,\
  \ it is extremely rewarding when the continuous effort pays off. It's midnight.\
  \ Bleary-eyed, I force myself to down a cup of coffee. We set off towards the beach\
  \ in total darkness. Naomi our volunteer lets out a squeal; \"babies\", she whispered\
  \ excitedly. And sure enough, below us, racing towards the ocean, were the stragglers\
  \ of a successfully hatched nest. We watched intently as they negotiated crab holes\
  \ in hope of evading a fatal encounter. \n\nHope. Conservation needs it."
