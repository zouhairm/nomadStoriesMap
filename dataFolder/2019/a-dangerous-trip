Text: "It was late November, and I was comfortably living the traveller lifestyle.\
  \ Long days at the beach, sunsets with a hunky bartender I was head over heels for,\
  \ island hopping, Thai green curries, elephants and a tan to last a life time. \n\
  \nI had gone out with a few friends to the famed Waterfall Party - magnificently\
  \ superior to the Full Moon Parties on Koh Phangan. The cocktails were flowing in\
  \ the VIP area, beer pong games were brewing and a halfway decent vibe was coming\
  \ from the DJ booth. \n\nLiam, my bartender paramour, and I were close in a  very\
  \ romantic way, but only in the way that summer romances can be, even in full bloom.\
  \ This boy had been with me through every adventure: breaking into the enclosure\
  \ at the elephant sanctuary and sleeping next to their barn, breaking into a private\
  \ viewpoint after it had closed to look for his missing phone (the view was even\
  \ better at night), becoming the reigning beer pong champions and leaving a path\
  \ of chaos and lust wherever we went.\n\nUntil the night of the waterfall party,\
  \ when everything changed. Not in a dramatic oh-my-god-its-over way. In a mature\
  \ way. Suddenly everything felt real. \n\nWe decided to ditch our friends and head\
  \ back to the resort, it was midnight and the pool was closed - but he pushed me\
  \ in anyway. I took him down with me. Giggling, laughing, splashing, we played like\
  \ children in the swimming pool. \n\n\"I'm hungry,\" I remember saying.\n\"Me too.\"\
  \ So we headed back to his room, where an abundance of snacks were waiting for us.\
  \ Liam tried the door, to no avail. His roommate had the key, and he was still out.\
  \ \n\n\"Don't worry,\" I said, \"I'll just climb over the balcony again.\" Liam\
  \ began to protest, but I waved him off as I had done it earlier that day, and he\
  \ hadn't climbed it at  all. I didn't see a problem doing it again. Famous last\
  \ words. \n\nI swing my leg over my side of the balcony to try and reach the other\
  \ side. I'd performed the task with ease just 9 hours previously, granted I was\
  \ not under the influence of tequila at that point, and also it was broad daylight.\
  \ I blinked, put both my feet down on the auning, moved slightly and heard a crack.\
  \ I feel myself fall. I hear nothing after that but the crash as I land on a wooden\
  \ chair 20 feet below me, and bounce off it into the bushes. \n\nIn the meantime,\
  \ Liam has come rushing to my aid. He heard the noise and panicked. I saw the blood\
  \ and panicked. I felt no pain. \n\nQuickly thinking, Liam took me to the local\
  \ hospital. He thought of everything - quickly packing an overnight bag, grabbing\
  \ my passport and keeping his wallet and ID on him at all times. \n\nI remember\
  \ panicking, and feel scared. And I remember him not leaving my side for a moment.\
  \ He held onto my hand as I had X-ray after X-ray. The doctors gave me some very\
  \ strong painkillers that made me say some very stupid things. But they gave me\
  \ the all clear, and Liam took me home. I had a mild concussion, so he moved me\
  \ into his room to keep an eye on me. \n\nIn the morning, when I woke up, I saw\
  \ him watching me. \n\n\"Hi,\" I said.\n\"Hi,\" he said.\n\"I'm so embarrassed,\"\
  \ I said.\n\"Don't be,\" he said, taking my hand.\n\n\"And just so you know, I love\
  \ you too.\" \n\nI guess Liam remembered the stupid thing I said last night. But\
  \ then things changed. This was us. And this was real now. I guess there's nothing\
  \ like a near death experience to bring two people together."
