Text: "There was a girl. She was pretty, and friendly, but the feature that would\
  \ stand up the most, was her orange afro hair. She was used to capture many stares,\
  \ so she didn't really mind the guy with the brow cardigan, black hat and messy\
  \ hair, who would allways stare at her from the bench at the park she had to cross\
  \ to get to school and back home, but still, there would be no exception, he would\
  \ look at her every day.\nOne day, she and her friends went to the movies, to watch\
  \ a new SiFi movie. Althoug it was nothing too innovative, (a movie about giant\
  \ alien bugs that would terrorise the earth) she had allways had a thing for things\
  \ like that. Suddenly, she saw the bugs coming out of the screen. At first she thought:\
  \ \"Wow, those are really good special effects\", then she remembered, that it was\
  \ not a 3D movie. She watched as the people were runing in fear trying to get the\
  \ bugs to stop eating their heads. Blood and dead bodies every were and a pearcing\
  \ feeling of a stare in her back. It was the man in the bench, stearing right at\
  \ her, never minding the bugs eating everybody. Her friends were gone. She did not\
  \ hesitate, and ran out of the cinema, expecting to see chaos, but intead, she saw:\
  \ a line for movie tikets, a line for popcorn, people walking, laughing, minding\
  \ their own buisness. She walked back to the cinema and saw people on their seats\
  \ in the darkness, iluminated only by the light of the screen, and her friends calling\
  \ her to her seat. She was so confused, so mutch so, that she did not question it.\n\
  \"Why did you flew like that\", one asked, \"Were you that frightened?\" \n\"I don't\
  \ know\", she replyed.\nThe man from the bench was no were to be found.\nThe next\
  \ day, she expected to see the man in the bench, but she didn't... for a week. Whe\
  \ she saw him again on her way to school, she decided to confront him.\n\"Who the\
  \ hell are you? What ever hapend in the movies the other night, had to do something\
  \ with you? Why are you staring at me?\"\nHe did not replly. He stood up and start\
  \ singing a little tune and walk towards a near by dying tree.\n\"Answer me!\",\
  \ she demanded.\nHe climed the dying tree and rised his hand to the sky, at the\
  \ same time, a giant silver sphere rested in his hand, all this while he stared\
  \ at her.\n\"Let me introduce you to the moon.\" He said, \"Folow me, learn all\
  \ the things I have to teach you, succed, and I will tell you my name\"."
