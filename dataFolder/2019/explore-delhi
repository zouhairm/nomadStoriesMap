Text: "A beautiful city with crazy weather and having population of 25 million people.\n\
  I'm talking about capital of India and historic city Delhi . I went for work but\
  \ I found this very interesting city to explore and travel . I stayed at hotel near\
  \ railway station and place was favourable to live . Local food was best with traditional\
  \ Indian texture . Firstly I tried pani puri , aalo tikki and moms ( indian Street\
  \ food ) . In case of taste and flavour these are best in my opinion . Delhi has\
  \ over a thousand documented monuments and historical sites and it\u2019s best to\
  \ plan carefully even if you want to only visit the more well-known 50-odd sites.\
  \ \n How to communicate with locals ? It is a common question comes in your mind\
  \ during travel . I was alone , no one familiar with me there but  some things were\
  \ in my favour and that was the language and culture . It doesn't matter I'm 800\
  \ km far away from my home . \nI made some friends  and they asked me to go to visit\
  \ some historical places in delhi . \nMy first visit was red fort . This place of\
  \ quite good and  huge number of peoples  were visiting there . It was connected\
  \ with Indian history were  Prime minister of India deliver their speech on independence\
  \ day .\nI had visited quite more places like lotus temple , South delhi and some\
  \ parks around there .\nI really connected with peoples and their way of living\
  \ . I played a cricket match with some other guys , cricket is really oh popular\
  \ sport in India . My watch was 20 - 20 format . \nI enjoyed a lot as a friend ,\
  \ as a traveler . I would like to appreciate people who were with me to explore\
  \ the whole city . Memories are still with me ."
