Text: "Being scattered destroyed me. The dread and unfamiliarity of every day life\
  \ came like a storm I didn't expect.\n\nDays passed and nothing changed. My inability\
  \ to understand my inner universe  took a toll on my personal and professional life.\n\
  \nI waited for the energy to change; \"this stale and incoherent flow must give\
  \ way to something new\". I was waiting for a rebirth\n\nUntil one day I received\
  \ a call.\n\nThe trip to Indonesia was planned out so I can create a demo reel for\
  \ an upcoming role. A change of scenery and chance to once again lose myself too\
  \ character followed by praise.\n\nI took the first plane out. Partly heading towards\
  \ that brighter future and partly running as far as I can from home.\n\nLong flights\
  \ get to me. They force me to think, without any distractions but sunsets and sunrises\
  \ passing by. And this one was not different.\n\nThirteen hours until I reached\
  \ a rugged airport late that night. My bright future is standing outside holding\
  \ a sign with my name on it. I am here\n\nLittle did I know that the future has\
  \ side plans; the universe knew something I didn't.\n\nThe card was not there, and\
  \ all connection with those who planned this curated adventure was lost. And I,\
  \ once again, was alone. Thousands of miles away from home.\n\nThere is poetry about\
  \ getting lost. This intricate flavor of beauty surrounding a journey into the unknown.\
  \ And this journey started to unfold in one of the most terrifying and real places\
  \ I've even been, Jakarta.\n\nThe city is dark, home to more than 10 million tired\
  \ souls. And I was determined to reach my hotel and get some rest because I wanted\
  \ tomorrow to come. Fast!\n\nThe next day arrived, but it carried little hope and\
  \ complications. And so I shifted my plans and found a new hostel. At this point,\
  \ abandonment didn't only leave a psychological scar, but a slowly draining money\
  \ supply that promises little for the time I had left until my flight back home\
  \ \n\nThis new home was a beacon of light. A good place to rest my worried mind\
  \ and tired body. until one night, my mind wandered again and I was filled with\
  \ thoughts that didn't belong to my present situation. And I, once again, got carried\
  \ away.\n\n\"You're in a new country, explore as much as you can\". \n\nAnd so I\
  \ boarded a 12 hour train towards the far side of Java Island. I am now in Surabaya.\n\
  \nI felt little relief, this place felt better. And so I sleep my thoughts off.\
  \ With a faint glimpse of hope that I am on the right path.\n\nThe next days I found\
  \ myself taking yet another leap of faith, an unexpected stop in Bali. \"The sin\
  \ City of the east\" someone once told me. \n\nArriving in Bali, I was mugged. Which\
  \ crippled my original plan and left me with more doubt towards my decisions, the\
  \ universe, and the good nature of humans. I still had expectations\n\nAnd this\
  \ is where the discovery began, that moment before giving up. Where my existence\
  \ rolled back to the most primitive form. I needed food and shelter to achieve the\
  \ clarity I need to move forward.\n\nFew days passed. I worked odd jobs because\
  \ now, I wanted to invest in an experience. Seeing the country I'm in no longer\
  \ interests me.\n\nIn Kuta, the days are all the same, tourists and noise and unexplained\
  \ heat. There were no limits, no right or wrong. Sin City indeed.\n\nBut I've had\
  \ my fill sooner than I expected. My plan to experience a new chapter of my addiction\
  \ must be fulfilled.\n\nIt was the day before the silent day, and I had to escape\
  \ to Gili Meno. A secluded Haven was all I need. \n\nEvery ride I took here distracted\
  \ me from enjoying the journey. I was still focusing on the destination.\n\nAnother\
  \ realization that drove me off the edge of my sanity.\n\nLost for hours, thinking\
  \ about my actions and motives. A boat ride is not the place to think. \n\nBut I\
  \ am here now. Lying in bed while tropical rain pour uncontrollably."
