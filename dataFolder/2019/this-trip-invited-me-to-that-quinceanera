Text: "I'd had been in Peru for about 2 months by that time. Humidity was already\
  \ part of my body and clothes, but the weather in Northern Peru was beyond humid.\
  \ Rather than breatheable, the air was drinkeable. I was staying in Mancora, one\
  \ of the most popular towns in the Piura region, well-known among surfers. The rainy\
  \ season there lasts from January to April and it is, ironically, the most touristic\
  \ one. I came to love the place: the sea was raw and wild. Although It was advised\
  \ to leave the beach before 5pm because the tide took over after that time, I loved\
  \ to stay on top of some rocks and watch the raging green waters do their violent\
  \ dance until the evening. That hobbie I took to, added to the eternal dampness\
  \ of my hair and clothes, gave me severe strep throat. My voice was gone.\n    \
  \ I was laying sick in bed when my roommates asked me if I wanted to go out with\
  \ them. My response could've been \"no thanks, I would rather stay and get better\"\
  , but my fear-of-missing-out response was \"yes, sure\". It was February so nightlife\
  \ in Mancora was intense. The intensity wasn't from big clubs or bars; it was from\
  \ street musicians and cheap beer cans, which is my favourite scenario for a night\
  \ out. However, I just felt horrible. After half an hour I announced I was going\
  \ back to bed, took a motor-taxi and rode through the muddy streets of Mancora.\
  \ \n     After ten minutes the motor stopped and the driver left to get some gas.\
  \ I didn't think it through when I told him I would wait for him there. I found\
  \ myself alone, sick and scared in a dark block, so I walked fast towards some lights\
  \ I saw around the corner. I bumped into a great spectacle: there was a long table\
  \ on the sidewalk with 30 people gathered around it enjoying a feast. There was\
  \ an enormous three story cake on the side, decorated with thick layers of meringue\
  \ and glitter. Next to them stood a young girl wearing a puffy tulle dress. Both\
  \ cake and girl resembled beautiful white, shiny clouds. It was a quincea\xF1era\
  \ party. They stared at me and I said \"hola\". I was scared and relieved at the\
  \ same time and they noticed. They all greeted back and one of them said \"OK well,\
  \ why aren't you partying with us?\", and offered me a chair. \n     I was immersed\
  \ in an unexpected family world. I met Cristina, who was a cook and had a flawless\
  \ bright yellow manicure. According to her, after years of chopping chilli pepper\
  \ for her dishes, her nails were stained forever and that was the only shade she\
  \ could pull off. The quincea\xF1era's name was Ingrid, a bubbly young girl who\
  \ wanted to travel to Ecuador to study Law, once she finished school. I asked her\
  \ if she liked her dress. She said \"no\", and burst into laughter. My tummy ended\
  \ up hurting from all the fun, the pisco and the beer. They gave me a corn beverage\
  \ for my strep throat. My voice magically came back and Diego, Ingrid's older brother,\
  \ taught me how to dance marinera, a folkloric dance, and then played some Argentinean\
  \ cumbia for me to feel at home.\n      It was 4 am when Ingrid changed into yoga\
  \ pants and a T-shirt, and Cristina revealed the cloud-like cake was made out of\
  \ styrofoam. I laughed even more and decided it was time to leave. There wasn't\
  \ enough room in my mouth to fit all the \"gracias\" I said to that family. I catched\
  \ a taxi and left. \n      After feeling such warmth I forgot about the humidity,\
  \ the dampness of all my clothes and everything that was bothering me those days.\
  \ I realised I'd had been in a deep \"solo travel\" mood until then, and although\
  \ that can be a wonderful state of mind and body, that night showed me I was really\
  \ needing some emotional contact. The direction of my trip changed radically after\
  \ that experience, which became all about real connections. And I knew that kind\
  \ of trip is the one I learn the most from."
