Text: "This is a story about my routine of commuting from S\xE3o Caetano do Sul to\
  \ Tucuruvi, or should I say this is a travelling journal? \nWell, I newly graduated\
  \ in Languages and I got a job as a teacher in a public school, the point is the\
  \ school is 26 kilometers away from home, so, it looks like a trip to me, a challenging\
  \ one though. Firstly, because I\u2019m 23 years old and I look excessively younger\
  \ than I really am, nobody believes me when I say I\u2019m a teacher, not a student.\
  \ Secondly, the distance. However, this is my chance and my time to do one of the\
  \ things I once said I\u2019d never do, staying four hours a day on a bus and taking\
  \ a crowded metro every day, not to mention the fact that I am supposed to wake\
  \ up at 4:30 in the morning. Bitter, tiring and boring days were waiting for me,\
  \ which was what I thought, luckily, I was strongly wrong. \nOn Friday, before I\
  \ officially had to start my labor days, I visited my new work, just not to get\
  \ lost on my first day. I followed the online map instructions and got to my final\
  \ destination. First impression: a faded dark blue covered the school building,\
  \ the entering of it was closed and I had to knock on the gate, a woman showed up\
  \ and asked me what I wished for, then I introduced myself and stepped into the\
  \ prison, sorry, I mean, the school. I could swear that its architecture was designed\
  \ to be a jail or a psychiatric hospital, the corridors were narrow, the lights\
  \ were fainting and thick metal grids protected all of the windows. \nA weekend\
  \ later, the decisive moment had arrived. I waited at the bus stop for an intercity\
  \ bus to get to the green line of the subway, distracted I almost missed it. When\
  \ I got into the metro, it wasn\u2019t as overcrowded as I\u2019d imagined, but\
  \ there was no empty sit, so I only sat when I was in the blue line, about eight\
  \ stations from the terminal where I should get another bus. On my way I stared\
  \ at the sunrise, it was the first time I appreciated that show of nature and from\
  \ the train I felt that I almost could touch it, impressively beautiful.\nWhen I\
  \ arrived at the school, people wondered who I was, afterwards what was a girl like\
  \ me was doing in the middle of the teaching staff? It was not that difficult to\
  \ explain myself and people kidded me about my childish appearance. I don\u2019\
  t know why, but my shyness still escorts me, especially when I need to socialize\
  \ with a new group, I guess it\u2019s normal for most women and men all around the\
  \ world to feel this way. Fortunately, there were also two new teachers in that\
  \ school, then, sooner than I expected I made friends with them and with the long-term\
  \ employees too.  I prefer to keep their names private, so that I can make them\
  \ omnipresent, once what truly makes a person is his or her traits, which are unique\
  \ but at the same time universal.  \nGetting to know people from S\xE3o Paulo and\
  \ places around it changed myself in a wordless manner, even so I\u2019ll try to\
  \ share what I\u2019ve learnt with them: friendship is a sort of love that sometimes\
  \ we aren\u2019t prepared to comprehend but it gently demonstrates the meaning of\
  \ existence to us, I\u2019d risk saying it\u2019s genuine love. So, why can\u2019\
  t we extend this feeling to our non-human fellows? I began to understand the basis\
  \ of veganism and stopped thinking they\u2019re extremists, now I\u2019m a vegetarian.\
  \ My fear of Mormons religion became nonsense once I grasped the basics of its Philosophy.\
  \ \nFinally, if once there was a pit of agitation by travelling alone, now there\u2019\
  s none. I feel like a free bird and thank destiny if it\u2019s real, because discovering\
  \ a new place is actually discovering multicultural aspects, even inside our own\
  \ country, making it possible to rebuild yourself."
