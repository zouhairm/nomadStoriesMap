Text: "Watching a soul wake up every morning with the energy of a warrior to watching\
  \ that soul wish it didn\u2019t exist has to be a rather common life play. \n\n\
  With every new beat within my chest, I pleaded for a fresh life as I faded into\
  \ someone I no longer knew.\nAfter 16 years of a perfect life experience, I woke\
  \ up and time decided that my happy hours were limited.\n\nMy world turned from\
  \ a perfect dream into a nightmare I could not even stand to think about as I fell\
  \ in love with a soul that everyone believed I was not destined to be with.\nAs\
  \ my tribe turned against me, my life became so filled with darkness that a once\
  \ very spiritual being who wanted to travel the world became a saddened silhouette\
  \ in a small town. \nForever trapped if I followed my heart.\n\nAs I packed my bag\
  \ and shed a tear to leave home after 3 years, I took a leap into my unknown fate.\n\
  I had no idea what would await me in this journey but I knew it could not be worse\
  \ than what had become of my once happy home.\n\nReturning to those memories 5 years\
  \ later, I look back with no regret and a gratitude for life as the master of experiences.\n\
  For 5 years, a broken human is what I saw when I looked into the mirror until a\
  \ situation I thought would break me, pulled me back into life\u2019s gauntlet.\n\
  \nDuring my 5 year journey, I travelled and worked in most Cities within Southern\
  \ Africa, fulfilling my dream to travel in the pursuit of finding myself.\nI settled\
  \ in what I though was the most beautiful town in Africa called Cape Town, so filled\
  \ with culture, musically inspired art and spirits from all over the world. \nI\
  \ stayed but never explored and saw people from the town not inspired by what they\
  \ saw.                         \n\nAfter a year of battling in the giant world of\
  \ business, I found myself homeless with no family around and no quick fix to shelter\
  \ me besides my little cooper.\nI would not let this situation be anything but an\
  \ addition to the successful life I envision so I packed my bags once more with\
  \ no destination.\n\nMy travel experience truly began in this moment where I needed\
  \ to make a local connection to this town, its people and its adventure. I now sleep\
  \ in my car every night where I feel the moon shining on me. I wake up a stone throw\
  \ away from the ocean with the sand as my morning yoga mat.\n\nThe gym has become\
  \ my part home, it is now more than where I come to train. It\u2019s where I get\
  \ clean, make friends and transform my mind and body for the day ahead.\n\nThe city\
  \ of Cape Town that I call home invites me for events every week and I am there\
  \ to let it find what I didn\u2019t expect. Myself!\n\nI now sit side by side with\
  \ my perfect soul that saved me from remaining in a small town, appreciating him\
  \ for helping me take a leap into the unknown.\n\nHe calls me his Melibu, a beautiful\
  \ experience."
