Text: "\u201CThat\u2019s a great shot.\u201D I tell my auntie as my extended family\
  \ gathers around a dining table in a sprawling house high on a hill, just on the\
  \ outskirts of Kandy. At least I think she\u2019s my auntie. When it comes to Sri\
  \ Lankan gatherings, it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell who is genuinely related\
  \ or how, so guesswork is key. She turns to look at the blown up black and white\
  \ photograph showing a charging elephant. Her eyes crinkle a bit and I cannot tell\
  \ if she\u2019s trying to suppress a smile or force one as her lips purse. \n\n\u201C\
  We took that picture ourselves in the jungle.  Unfortunately we had to shoot him\
  \ since he charged straight for us.\u201D She tells me.\n\nOh. My heart sinks a\
  \ little and part of me wishes I hadn\u2019t asked. The painting looks more sombre\
  \ than stunning now. \n\n\u201CActually, that\u2019s his foot over there.\u201D\
  \ She adds, pointing to the back of the house where an elephant leg is propping\
  \ open the door to let a breeze through while simultaneously acting as an umbrella\
  \ holder. \n\nOh shit! Now I really wish I hadn\u2019t asked. It\u2019s hard to\
  \ eat your parripu when you feel like there\u2019s an elephant haunting the dining\
  \ room. \n\nAs I get lost in my own thoughts, I thumb over the smooth terracotta\
  \ of the table\u2019s centrepiece and my family\u2019s boisterous Sinhalese fades\
  \ into a warm white noise. The statuette is of three plump Sinhalese women cackling\
  \ with glee as they squat in a semi circle and fan themselves with paper fans. My\
  \ mother tells me that they embody her and her two vibrant sisters, which I can\
  \ easily see when I hold her hand, the skin a dark, dusky terracotta that is a near\
  \ perfect match and is soft with age and coconut oil. I am far paler. I don\u2019\
  t fit in with the surrounding color palette, as I am a homogenized blend between\
  \ an eggshell white and a rich brown- my father and mother. We came back to Sri\
  \ Lanka so that my sister and I could learn about our culture, but I came here with\
  \ a stricter agenda: finding my people and finally blending in. \n\nGrowing up in\
  \ the predominantly white, middle class neighbourhoods of Canada and the States,\
  \ I was never white enough and I became convinced that I would finally find solace\
  \ in my motherland. I wasn\u2019t expecting these uncomfortable moments and I certainly\
  \ wasn\u2019t expecting the culture shock. How on earth could I be shocked by my\
  \ own culture, but here I was: the palest person in the room, listening to a language\
  \ I did not understand, probably surrounded by malevolent pachyderm spectres, while\
  \ my stomach rejected the intense Sri Lankan peppers put into nearly every dish\
  \ (something I would pay for later that night).  This whole exercise felt like a\
  \ failure. I wasn\u2019t brown enough to fit in here and was now doomed to a Sisyphean\
  \ game of trying to fit in. \n\nSunrise broke through the mountains the next morning,\
  \ creating a thick blanket of soft dawn mist that blanketed the Buddhist temple\
  \ at the centre of Kandy. The cool, clean smell of the air made the morning crisp\
  \ instead of the usual mugginess that pervaded typhoon season. The white temple\
  \ rose seamlessly, impassively from the fog; the looming towers imposing humility\
  \ onto those who walked in its shadow. We joined the sea of worshippers slowly wading\
  \ through the mist towards the tooth of Buddha. I spoke no Sinhalese, but as the\
  \ monks led puja, it seemed inconsequential, as I, startlingly, inherently understood\
  \ the intentions of the day\u2019s prayer. \n\nBe humble. Tread lightly. Find happiness.\
  \ \n\nIt was almost irritatingly simple, but that was exactly the point. My happiness\
  \ could not come from fulfilling my abstract desire to belong to an ethnic group\
  \ and seamlessly blend in. That was too complex, too reliant on external factors,\
  \ and too intangible. Instead, I could just choose to be happy. Happy with myself,\
  \ happy with all I had in that moment, and happy with everything that I lacked.\
  \ \n\nUnder the eye of Buddha, I found my peace."
