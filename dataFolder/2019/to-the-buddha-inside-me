Text: "The challenge was to wake up early\u2026and only God knows, I'm not a morning\
  \ person!. The dong rang 45 minutes earlier that day in Tushita, the Buddhist silence\
  \ based Ashram for an early meditation followed by early breakfast to head off to\
  \ His Holiness the Dalai Lama  who came to Dharamshala for 4 days to teach at his\
  \ own temple. 5:30 am, the dong rang again making it a tough to ignore the excitement\
  \ of meeting such inspirational figure that I used to share his quotes on Facebook,\
  \ I decided to wake up. \n     The meditation ended 6:15 am, breakfast ended 7:00\
  \ am. The group gathered \"silently\" to start our 20 mints hiking journey towards\
  \ his HH temple. It was the second day for me in the camp, a first-time experience\
  \ with no phones or gadgets yet I needed that silence as my thoughts were noisy\
  \ enough! \n      Going down through the tiny cold lanes which was mysteriously\
  \ enough filled with fragrance of life  and seeing the spectacular view made me\
  \ feel that this hilly area is embraced with such a lively, spiritual bubble due\
  \ to the footprints of holy people starting from Buddha himself according to the\
  \ Tibetan Mahayana. This silence had something to it that I was yet to discover.\n\
  \      Different people from the course passing by me \"silently\" until we reached\
  \ Dharamshala. We crossed the silence curfew, people started talking. I had to stop\
  \ by a mobile shop to buy a radio for translation of HH teachings and that's when\
  \ I met Ben. He was looking for someone to share radio. On the way to the temple\
  \ I came to know that Ben started to challenge his mind and his Beliefs and that's\
  \ what brought him here. As we were waiting for entry through endless line we met\
  \ Judy, 9 months ago Judy decided to quit her job, gave up her apartment, collected\
  \ her savings and started her own journey across the world seeking the purpose of\
  \ life. \n     While waiting in the line I was puzzled to see all types of people\
  \ standing for two hours with serene reaction. It was really remarkable! \n    \
  \ Finally reaching the Dalai Lama ..almost!. I wasn\u2019t lucky enough to sit near\
  \ him but I got to see him on the screens. It was soothing enough, I was as happy\
  \ as the Tibetan children around, I felt so blessed by seeing the Dalai Lama, an\
  \ opportunity that rarely comes.\n      On my way back I got lost in crowd away\
  \ from Judy, Ben had already left in the middle of the session. I had to figure\
  \ out the way back on my own. My clamorous thoughts, the hussy busy city and standing\
  \ at cross roads trying to decide which one to choose. 'I'm doomed'. I chose the\
  \ hilly glazed road, it was the right choice but not for me, a person who never\
  \ went on a trek before and live in a plain country.\n It was terror. \nAs I climbed\
  \ those last 14 steps towards my room. I threw myself on bed, 7 minutes later I\
  \ was starving, I took a struggling shower and went to grab the leftovers of lunch\
  \ and sat \"silently\".\n      A couple of middle aged women were trying to sneak\
  \ talking and evidently they weren't the only ones. That's when I met Jen and Lauren\
  \ who were from the US, on a tour around India. They were impressed by how a Muslim\
  \ girl is here. 30 minutes later of pleasant talk we made a promise to compel silence.\n\
  \     At 6:45 pm when I finished my dinner, I had 45 minutes left for the last session\
  \ of the day. I sat on one of the benches placed on the tip of the hill, looking\
  \ at the glowing lights of the cities below in the wide darkness ahead. Proving\
  \ that darkness isn't necessarily ugly, sometimes it is needed to recognize beauty\
  \ and that's when I met someone after a long time, who came to India a year ago\
  \ pursuing passion of traveling, fell in love, went through life-challenging situations,\
  \ came here seeking passion again and ambitious to find the answers in silence,\
  \ after a very long time I was able to listen to ME."
