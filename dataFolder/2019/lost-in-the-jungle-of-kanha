Text: "The culture and practices of the tribes of India form a rich part of our history.\
  \ Whether it is in the realm of arts, music, dance, handicrafts, or innovation,\
  \ their way of life is one which is unique. However, it is true that they remain\
  \ off the radar of mainstream India on most days. Being nomadic nature once landed\
  \ me in the jungle of Kanha reserve forest of central India and fortunately I got\
  \ a home stay near the tribal village.Dance and music are a way of expression, and\
  \ for India\u2019s tribal communities, it has become an aspect which defines their\
  \ culture. There I came across one tribal woman named Rivan bai (name changed).\
  \ A member of the Pardhi tribe, in Chhattisgarh, Rivan is a world-renowned Pandavani\
  \ exponent. This art form involves singing, playing various traditional instruments,\
  \ and enacting scenes from the Mahabharata, and Teejan has been invited to other\
  \ countries to perform, which has put her tribe on the global map! Whether it is\
  \ to express joy, entertain, or celebrate, the hundreds of folk dances that India\u2019\
  s tribes have given to the country has definitely added to India\u2019s cultural\
  \ repertoire.I came to know about their costumes which I also have common interest.It\
  \ is the tribal costumes of Chhattisgarh that endow the costumes of the state with\
  \ a unique identity and arise interest among the tourists. The tribal men and women\
  \ wear bright and colorful costumes. Use of a variety of colors in the costumes\
  \ is the distinct feature of the costumes worn here. Jewelry like neckpieces made\
  \ of metal casts, silver ghungroos, chunky wooden bangles, etc. is worn widely by\
  \ the tribal population. Men in tribal groups like Halbas, Ghotuls, Abhuj Marias,\
  \ Murias, etc. wear dhotis and headgears like cotton turbans, for protection from\
  \ the harsh sun during the day. The women wear knee-length or full length sarees\
  \ in bright colors.A wonderful display of tribal costumes can be witnessed during\
  \ festivals. Peacock feathers, bright headgears, chunky ornaments made of wood,\
  \ metal, etc. lend a colorful atmosphere to the air of festivities. Gaudy costumes\
  \ in striking colors too are features of the tribal festivals. Ornaments made of\
  \ beads, feathers and cowries are seen amply in these festivals. Ghungroos and beads\
  \ made of silver and other material make a tinkling sound and add to the already-high\
  \ spirit of the festivals.Being a food lover and blogger I explored their cuisine\
  \ too.It is a time to go creative with food, a time for trying out nutritious and\
  \ tasty wild vegetables. The tribals believe in eating local, seasonal food. These\
  \ are medicinal and provide strength. In early July, the tribals pluck tender bamboo\
  \ shoots after they grow up to one foot in height. Some also sell bamboo shoots.\
  \ For the next few months, bamboo shoots become the staple food.\nSlivers of bamboo\
  \ shoots are dried and can be stored to be cooked later. Other food options become\
  \ available in September. But if you are looking for new recipes to impress your\
  \ family and friends, Bastar is not the right place. Cooking is minimum. Pej\u2014\
  a soup made of rice, mandia (ragi millet) or corn\u2014is the only dish cooked regularly.\
  \ Elaborate meals are a rarity in this area.\nAamat, a tangy soup made with bamboo\
  \ shoots (known as basta in Gondi and kareel in Chhattisgarhi), is the only dish\
  \ which has a detailed list of ingredients and preparation method. Aamat also means\
  \ sour in the local dialect. The recipe is low in calorie and highly nutritious.\
  \ Bamboo shoots are low in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium and high in fibre,\
  \ vitamin C, thiamine, vitamin B6, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, manganese,\
  \ protein, vitamin E, riboflavin, niacin and iron.\n\nAamat can be easily altered\
  \ to suit different palates. The preparation is long and needs patience; accompaniments\
  \ of rice or pej are optional. Lachandai Netam, an elderly resident of village Leda,\
  \ who provided Down To Earth with instructions on how to prepare the dish, said\
  \ tribals in the region consider vegetables grown in the wild as good for health.\n\
  \nAamat when eaten hot, keeps cold, cough, chest infection and other common ailments\
  \ of the season at bay. For fever, it's effective in removing the bitter taste in\
  \ the mouth"
