Text: "During my childhood I had the pleasure to share with my grandmother her interest\
  \ in ancient history, specially about Greek mythology. Hearing her telling all that\
  \ stories about Medusa, Aphrodite and many other mythical characters fascinated\
  \ me so much that once, during school, my teacher asked us to draw our favorite\
  \ heroes and I chose Zeus with his lightning bolt. The only problem was that drawing\
  \ wasn\u2019t really one of my skills and the result was something looking like\
  \ Santa Claus with a knife in his hand. You can imagine if my mother got a call,\
  \ yes? Now when I remember I laugh about it but at the time was kind of a mess.\
  \ Anyway, last summer, my friends decided to organize a Eurotrip and Greece was\
  \ in our route. It was a dream coming true, we were going to Athens and from there\
  \ we would sail to the small islands near by, passing through Hydra, Poros, Mykonos\
  \ and Santorini. I was counting the days and finally in July I got to my destination.\
  \ The road to Athens wasn\u2019t the best but once arriving to the city my expectations\
  \ were fulfilled, the place was amazing. When we got to the hotel I was astonished\
  \ with the amazing view of Acropolis, an ancient citadel, containing the Parthenon\
  \ and other notable buildings, mostly dating from the 5th century BC. I was speechless\
  \ with the grandiosity of that place. The next day we ask information about the\
  \ attractions to a local taxi driver that recommended buying a day ticket with access\
  \ to several places. He was so nice that ended driving us every where, so we went\
  \ to the Panathenaic Stadium, were the first Olympic games in history happened,\
  \ the Temple of Athena, the Temple of Zeus and for last he drop us at Acropolis.\
  \ After a long day we still had energy to go out at night so we picked a place called\
  \ Bolivar, super cute tikki style bar just in front of the beach. Getting there\
  \ we stayed in a really nice table close to a group of locals. I asked for a drink\
  \ and while I waited I spotted a strong tall man with white skin, beard and dark\
  \ hair, he was so masculine and at the same time had such a kind expression, I was\
  \ hypnotized. We instantly connected and through simple body signals we walk to\
  \ the beach far from the noise and our friends and introduced ourselves with a delightful\
  \ smile on our faces. His name was Thanos, he was born in Greece, lived and worked\
  \ in Athens as an engineer. Time flied while we talked so before leaving we exchanged\
  \ numbers and he invited me to show the city next day.  After a day shopping in\
  \ the local markets I went back to the hotel and got ready for our tour.   Thanos\
  \ picked me up and we went to have dinner in a typical restaurant in the area. The\
  \ Greek food is very flavorful, we had the famous Greek salad and the Moussaka,\
  \ an eggplant and potato-based dish with ground meat that looks like lasagna. After\
  \ our delicious meals he took me to the Monastiraki, were he showed me the huge\
  \ market located in the historic district and then walk me to the Temple of Hephaestus,\
  \ were he talked vividly about its history involving the graves and crumbling ruins\
  \ spread all over the place. After a long walk back to the hotel, we shared the\
  \ most passionate kiss I can remember I had in my life. The next morning I was sailing\
  \ to the islands and from there I would head to to Italy, Spain and then back home.\
  \ During my role trip we kept in touch and I would send him pictures of the places\
  \ I was passing by. After three months I was back to Greece to visit him and now\
  \ he is coming to the States to stay with me. I think now I understand I draw as\
  \ a kid my hero for life."
