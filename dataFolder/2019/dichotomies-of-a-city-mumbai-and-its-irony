Text: "\"Would you like to buy these pens? Didi, pens? I need thirty rupees for a\
  \ Vada-Pao, please!\u201D called an unfamiliar voice, breaking my reverie. The voice\
  \ seemed pregnant with polar twins \u2013 it carried innocence and experience at\
  \ the same time.\n\nMy eyes had been closed because of their indecisiveness. Much\
  \ like every other tourist, I had chosen the most popular spot in Mumbai and was\
  \ ignorantly content with my choice. Here I was, mesmerized by the view that Marine\
  \ Drive offered and contemplating what was more beautiful \u2013 the human-made\
  \ skyline or the natural born sea. I opened them to see a freckled, dirty face with\
  \ unkempt hair staring straight at me. \n\"30 rupees! Which vadapao is this, now?\"\
  \ I asked him. \"It's the best one in Bombay, Didi, and I'm very hungry. Please\
  \ didi!\" he reiterated. Didi is the Hindi word for big sister, and though most\
  \ Indians use it casually, he used it with familiarity for a stranger. My friends\
  \ had hyped me up plenty about the city\u2019s famous street food, but I also knew\
  \ that most of these children\u2019s parents make them beg for money to feed their\
  \ own drug addictions. I looked around and saw an old man sitting at the edge of\
  \ a rock, obviously intoxicated beyond repair. \"Okay, but take me with you to this\
  \ Vada-pao place\", I told him. \nAs we manoeuvred through the crowded streets between\
  \ the art deco buildings of South Mumbai, I unearthed the many layers of my new\
  \ companion. Ravi was a 12-year-old orphan who lived on the shores of Chowpatty\
  \ beach. He went to a government school in the morning and sold pens at Marine Drive\
  \ in the evening. In the city of dreams where everyone landed to become a Bollywood\
  \ actor or singer, he was an aspiring architect and had quite an impressive amount\
  \ of knowledge about the same.\nNow munching on the truly delicious vadapao, he\
  \ pointed towards a blue-glassed skyscraper that stood out because of its uneven\
  \ structure and said: \"That's Antilla, the most expensive residence in the world\"\
  . His eyes filled with amazement as he told me about the six hundred staff members\
  \ that keep that place tidy, the many ATMs inside the house, the helicopter pads\
  \ on the roof and the best sea-view that one would get in Mumbai. I imagined standing\
  \ at the rooftop of that building and looking down at the city \u2013 inevitably,\
  \ the many slums around it would add a different kind of blue to the view. \n\n\
  The dark sky made me glance at my watch and I announced that my train departs in\
  \ an hour. He insisted on walking me to the nearest station: \"It's only a 10-minute\
  \ walk, didi. The cab will take time; there\u2019s so much traffic\u201D. \nWhen\
  \ the clock struck 6, the Victoria Terminus train station lit up in hues of pink\
  \ and yellow. He was busy explaining to me the gothic architecture of the building,\
  \ and I was busy trying to get him to pose for a quick picture before we parted\
  \ ways. In the end, we met halfway - I got a blurry picture of him passionately\
  \ blabbering about the gargoyles and their history. \n\nNow seated somewhat uncomfortably\
  \ in the train, I passed through the third largest slum in the world, ironically\
  \ located in Mumbai - the financial capital of India. I shifted my gaze from the\
  \ blue slum to the picture in my hand - of an independent twelve-year-old who lived\
  \ in a gully but aspired to become an architect. His gleaming eyes reflected the\
  \ horizon which, just like the city, merged two opposing worlds.  So many creators\
  \ and artists had tried to capture the true essence of Mumbai- you could see it\
  \ in movies and hear it in song lyrics. If there was one picture that could describe\
  \ this city, though, I thought \u2013 this was it."
