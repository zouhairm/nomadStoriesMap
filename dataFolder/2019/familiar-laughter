Text: "The moment I pushed through the screen door of the cluttered wine shop in Finale\
  \ Ligura, Italy came alive to me in a whole new way. Behind the counter I saw the\
  \ sun-weathered face, unkempt curling dark hair and toothy grin of an elderly man\
  \ who was equal parts distinguished and jolly. Alberto, my distant cousin. \nWe\
  \ had spoken on the phone the day before with my halting Italian phrases punctuated\
  \ by his generously patient, though still too fast for me to decipher, Italian dappled\
  \ with English. I doubt we understood half of what the other was saying, but in\
  \ the boisterous and disarmingly welcoming Italian way that I continually encountered\
  \ in this country, I somehow found myself with an address in hand as I stepped off\
  \ the train the next morning. I hoped I had correctly interpreted that I was invited\
  \ to drop in. If it turned out I wasn\u2019t, the tone of our previous conversation\
  \ suggested we were sure to clarify the situation with laughter and more failed\
  \ attempts at conversing. Luckily, the smile that lit up his face when I swung open\
  \ the screen door, rattling the many bottles that covered the walls and floor, showed\
  \ he had been expecting me. I could only guess that he recognized me instantly by\
  \ my clear lack of the understated Italian style I had become accustomed to falling\
  \ short of.\nAfter a brief introduction that mostly consisted of grinning at each\
  \ other, I was soon whisked away down the winding stone streets amongst the softly\
  \ colored stucco and tile homes that dot this part of the Mediterranean coast. Laying\
  \ just south of the elegance and decadence that seems to define Monaco and its inhabitants,\
  \ this peaceful, down-to-earth town was the perfect antidote to the spectacle of\
  \ grandeur I had just passed through to arrive here.  \nAs the afternoon and evening\
  \ progressed through endless courses of homemade specialties and secret recipes\
  \ on Alberto\u2019s outdoor terrace, I was introduced to three generations of family,\
  \ all of whom lived together in the same house in this unassuming place that whispered\
  \ of both an undiscovered paradise and the meandering familiarity that came with\
  \ day to day life nestled into this sleepy hillside. There was no hesitation in\
  \ this family\u2019s welcome, none of the reserved tone or tentative demeanor that\
  \ often comes with first meetings back home. Their ease with each other, the abandon\
  \ in the decibel and enthusiasm of their responses showed a level of familiarity\
  \ that left me both exhausted and envious of lives lived with such exuberance. This\
  \ culture lived and breathed hospitality long after most respectable Canadians are\
  \ tucked into bed.\nThough I had experienced moments of pleasant surprise at the\
  \ lack of reserved civility in the previous six months while I\u2019d been living\
  \ in the Italian city of Padova, this was something new. Surrounded by glowing faces,\
  \ with my sandals scratching over the smooth stone of a terrace that had belonged\
  \ to this family, my family, for hundreds of years, I listened to the laughter.\
  \ Laughter that carried traces of the same reckless spirit I heard in my grandfather\u2019\
  s laugh, though he had left Italy as a young boy. I felt connected to this place\
  \ and these people in a way that made my heart full and also tugged at the deep\
  \ longing experienced at bridges one approaches but cannot quite cross, while feeling\
  \ that magnetic pull to the opposite shore.\nA wise friend often said to me, \u201C\
  every \u2018yes\u2019 means a thousand \u2018no\u2019s \u2018\u201D and on that\
  \ evening I felt the ripple effect of \u201Cyes\u2019s\u201D made by generations\
  \ past. Decisions that set the stage for my life and all the accompanying meaning\
  \ that geography and culture bestow on a person. I could dip my toe into this Mediterranean\
  \ version of my family and almost taste an alternate life with all its seeming simplicity\
  \ and inevitable complexities. I often catch myself in the delicious imaginings\
  \ of other lives lived in other places. Those wonderings carried a sad sweetness\
  \ that night when the kisses, laughter and farewells died away and I sat alone on\
  \ the train, feeling wistful and grateful all at once."
