Text: "Traveling alone is one of my greatest and most misunderstood passions. Coming\
  \ from a Latin American country, Mexico, it is difficult for many people to see\
  \ me take a suitcase and go to places sometimes close and sometimes more distant,\
  \ in which I have not been before and where I usually do not know anyone.\n\nTraveling\
  \ without company is a reconnection of my own pieces, and Pisa represented the most\
  \ recent and biggest of those reconnections because it was there, after drinking\
  \ a bottle of ros\xE9 wine and finding the Tower of Pisa by mistake, where I discovered\
  \ that I no longer wanted to travel alone. I thought I was referring to the action\
  \ in general, but I was wrong, I was referring to a pattern of my life that was\
  \ about to break, along with my heart.\n\nMy next destination after Italy would\
  \ be the United Kingdom, where a trip that had been planned for months would finally\
  \ take place and where, for one weekend, I could finally be free to walk hand in\
  \ hand with a man with who I had been secretly walking for 7 years, and who was\
  \ legally tied to someone else.\n\nIt is impossible not to generate expectations\
  \ before something that accelerates your heart in such a way actually happens, but\
  \ if something (or someone) always curbed my expectations on anything, it was him,\
  \ whom from now on we will call Mi Guapo. And this time was not the exception. I\
  \ had asked him to take care of booking the place where we would stay. I had asked\
  \ him to be an AirBnN because I think I unconsciously had the fantasy to be able\
  \ to  \"play house\" with him, instead of ending up in another impersonal hotel.\
  \ Anf of course I had numerous sexual fantasies about spending the weekend together,\
  \ but for some reason, my biggest fantasies for that trip had to do with cooking\
  \ together and taking long baths. Corny, I know.\n\nBut (and now I know), like every\
  \ time I put things in his hands, everything turned into a mess. Being the autocontrolled\
  \ controller that I am, the fact that for Wednesday there was no reservation, put\
  \ my nerves on edge. The above finished in a drama in which I am not going to deepen,\
  \ but I will just say that my last night in Pisa, after 12 days of traveling alone\
  \ around Europe, ended in a long distance call with crying, many \"I love youS\"\
  \ and an Ibis hotel reservation included. I was dying to go to London and at the\
  \ same time it hurt to think about it. Goodbye fantasy.\n\nThe lady behing the check-in\
  \ counter asked \"Is London your final destination?\" and her words rumbled in my\
  \ head. At that moment I romanticized it, as I always do, and I thought \"Yes !,\
  \ YES !, it's finally London!\". I sent him a message and right after that I got\
  \ into the Duty Free Store and bought a Chianti bottle and a Prosciutto bag. Now\
  \ I know that perhaps that lady's words were rather a kind of prophecy.\n\nMeeting\
  \ someone at a train station should be one of the biggest cliches of great romances.\
  \ I remember my legs shaking as I looked at the board the trains announcing their\
  \ arrival. \"Cambridge: 3 minutes\". My phone, stored inside my backpack, let me\
  \ hear his personalized ringtone, I did not want to take it out, I knew he had arrived\
  \ and when I turned around I was able to confirm it. The drama of the previous night\
  \ and all the fears that arose from it were suspended in the longest hug. \n\nWe\
  \ had three days ahead. We were far away from everything and everyone else. We were\
  \ in another continent, in another schedule. He was mine as never before and I was\
  \ more his than ever."
