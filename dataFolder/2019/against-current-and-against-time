Text: "It\u2019s ninety-three degrees outside.  The dust and love bugs loiter outside\
  \ my window like homeless men with cardboard signs; I avoid eye contact.  My car\u2019\
  s air conditioner just quit on a backroad in July and my paper map tells me I could\
  \ be in either Louisiana or Mississippi.  The dotted line of the state border swoops\
  \ like a bird over the Mississippi River, which has changed course many, many times.\
  \  I at least know I\u2019m on my way to the Delta, traveling upstream from New\
  \ Orleans, against current and against time to document the river\u2019s role in\
  \ the history of moonshine.  \n\nThe Delta, in northwest Mississippi, is a low-lying\
  \ alluvial plain, a sweeping landform of sediment deposited by the river.  Everything\
  \ is farmland up here, dark green clusters of trees in the distance, rich brown\
  \ dirt at your feet, blue-black clouds heavy with rain above.  You\u2019re so close\
  \ to the earth here, so close to the beginning of it all that you can smell it.\n\
  \nAfter an hour\u2019s more hot drive, I pull up to Roy\u2019s Store to meet Hank\
  \ Burdine, a Delta know-it-all.  His hair is white like lightning.  His head cocked.\
  \  His lip twitches like a dog who\u2019s unsure whether he likes the smell of you\
  \ or not.  Around noon, he asks me if I want a Pimm\u2019s Cup or a Delta Hoojoo.\
  \  I gamble with the latter and my lips go a little numb sipping the orange juice,\
  \ cranberry juice, and vodka concoction.  They\u2019re good at drinking here and\
  \ they\u2019re good at making their own fun, as Hank puts it.  They\u2019ve also\
  \ been known to be good at making something else.\n\nDuring prohibition, the marshy\
  \ islands scattered down the river were covered in moonshining stills, and people\
  \ would bury kegs on the banks to hide and age the liquor.  Hank tells me about\
  \ John Johnson and his motorboat, how  \u201Cwhen the [Great Flood of 1927] came,\
  \ all that whiskey popped up out of the ground and he\u2019d load up fifteen, twenty\
  \ kegs a day when he\u2019s supposed to be loading folks up.  Then he\u2019d take\
  \ it out and sell it on the levee.\u201D  \n \nThat night, Hank throws a party on\
  \ Lake Washington.  I meet Jack Jackson and Bo Weevil and Brucie, who all make the\
  \ same gesture, a squinted eye and pointed finger, when they each say to me, verbatim,\
  \ \u201COne moonshiner could stand on his still on Big Island and see twenty or\
  \ thirty others down the coastline.\u201D  I like it each time I hear it, though.\
  \  I imagine the first time they each heard the story.\n\nThese people like tales\
  \ of wily men who listen and watch and let nature do her thing and then reap the\
  \ rewards of their cunning and her fury.  I\u2019d wager that it was their moonshining\
  \ ancestors\u2019 acceptance of the river\u2019s chaos and their meager existence\
  \ on its banks that made them good at what they did, so good there\u2019s little\
  \ record of them.\n\nThese might just be tall tales, anecdotes mumbled into tumblers\
  \ of whiskey, but they remind me of the paper map, the dotted line.  The Mississippi\
  \ might not follow it anymore, but memories of the way it once was surface along\
  \ the line as oxbow lakes, bayous, and abandoned meanders.  In the same way, the\
  \ people here grow up listening to stories of moonshiners.  They have babies and\
  \ they one day tell them about Big Island.  They hunt alligators and grow soybeans\
  \ and throw parties where they shake jars filled with clear liquor to see how long\
  \ the bubbles last.  They grow old, die, get buried in the ground here.  But the\
  \ stories survive like the oxbow lakes they live on.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the stories\
  \ to which I cling when I say goodbye on a Sunday morning.  I order one Delta Hoojoo\
  \ for the road, hold the orange juice and the cranberry juice and even the vodka.\
  \  Driving back from where I\u2019ve come, back into the present, I roll down my\
  \ windows and grab clean ice cubes out of the styrofoam cup.  I rub them against\
  \ my forehead and behind my ears until they melt and the water flows south down\
  \ my arms and over my bones."
