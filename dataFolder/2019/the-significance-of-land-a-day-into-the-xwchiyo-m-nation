Text: "While humans are busy debating rights and wrongs, nature just is: it flows\
  \ with a life of its own in the correct manner. With wisdom, fluency and grandeur,\
  \ silencing all hesitation. \n\nI pondered upon this thought two years ago, as the\
  \ Fraser River flowed before my eyes. The whole scene gently covered by a layer\
  \ of fog. A pastel grey sky added the perfect modest background to the already flamboyant\
  \ dark green of the forest and the foaming, rapidly moving waters of the river.\
  \ The forest, as always, made me feel profoundly rooted. I closed my eyes, soaked\
  \ in the crisp, fresh air of an endless ocean of trees, and felt at peace.\nIn January\
  \ 2016 I left my home country El Salvador, a land of wild volcanoes, paradisiac\
  \ beaches, turquoise lakes and majestic mountain ranges, to move to BC\xB4s Lower\
  \ Mainland in Canada. It is difficult to grasp the sublime natural beauty of British\
  \ Columbia - an almost infinite array of places to explore. From the over 100 islands\
  \ in the Pacific Rim National Park to the magnificent Canadian Rockies, the province\
  \ has 1,030 parks and protected areas. With a land mass that is four times the size\
  \ of Great Britain, two-thirds of which is forest land (with more than half of it\
  \ with little to no human contact), British Columbia can entertain the most avid\
  \ nature explorer for a lifetime. \n\nLast month, I was heading east of Highway\
  \ 1, venturing into the mountainous city of Chilliwack. This time, however, I was\
  \ not here to explore nature, but history. I was invited through a non-profit to\
  \ enter the Xwch\xEDy\xF3:m Nation Reserve, at the heart of the Chilliwack forest.\
  \ An experience that has drastically changed the way I perceive the meaning of land\
  \ and nature in British Columbia.\n\nThe Xwch\xEDy\xF3:m Nation is one of the 198\
  \ distinct First Nations based in BC. Indigenous People have lived in BC for more\
  \ than 10,000 years, developing their own societies, cultures, territories and laws.\
  \ Prior to European contact in 1778, BC\xB4s indigenous peoples numbered around\
  \ 300 000, and remained largely undisturbed. After European contact, facing two\
  \ centuries of persecution, systematic oppression, and cultural genocide, the number\
  \ of indigenous peoples has radically reduced, and the 200,000 that remain have\
  \ been stripped from a large part of their ancestral lands. \nWe were here in the\
  \ Xwch\xEDy\xF3:m Nation to learn about indigenous history from Andrew, the Nation\xB4\
  s chief. He chaired the \u201Cblanket exercise\u201D, an interactive, profoundly\
  \ stirring 2-hour activity that sought to put us in the shoes of indigenous people,\
  \ while we stepped on blankets that represented the land, and moved decade by decade\
  \ through two and a half centuries that dramatically affected the land, culture\
  \ and survival of First Nations communities. The exercise brought tears, anger and\
  \ profound realizations. \n\nIt made me think of the many who, like myself, mindlessly\
  \ visit and populate this land, without acknowledging those who called it home first.\
  \ It made me think of the amount of beauty it would bring to the province if its\
  \ indigenous people were respected and their cultures appreciated. How much richness\
  \ would arise from enjoying nature with those who have so passionately venerated\
  \ and preserved it for thousands of years.\n\nWalking with Andrew through the reserve,\
  \ we observed Mount Cheam, gloriously standing in the background. As most other\
  \ mountains in BC, it made me sigh in awe. Andrew explained that Mount Cheam is\
  \ seen by the Xwch\xEDy\xF3:m Nation as an incarnation of their ancestors, who are\
  \ still overseeing and protecting them. If I felt profoundly rooted to the land,\
  \ \u2013 me, a foreigner who lives in urban centers and takes the occasional trip\
  \ to nature - how much more rootedness can a person have to their land if they have\
  \ a line of ancestors living there for thousands of years? \n\nIndeed, nature is\
  \ truly wise. It has space for everyone, and if stewarded properly, it will continue\
  \ to sustain life. In a territory as big as British Columbia, nature provided space\
  \ for everyone to peacefully coexist. But we humans keep debating between rights\
  \ and wrongs, and more often than not, choose to compete and oppress, reducing what\
  \ is plentiful to self-incurred zero-sum games."
