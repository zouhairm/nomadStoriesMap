Text: "Solo travel was till now only a concept and a dream that was yet to be realised.\
  \ There was always an unending urge, but never the readiness to take the plunge.\
  \ And then there comes that point in life when you do not think too much of the\
  \ pros and cons, just jump! That's what life is all about!  This was that point\
  \ in my life.\nThe thought was simple - I needed to travel. Solo. Fend for myself.\
  \ Keep myself safe. Tell myself and the people around me that the world is not all\
  \ that bad. Explore and Experience the unknown.\nAfter researching different options\
  \  I finally choose the beautiful beach town of Pondicherry to embark on my first\
  \ adventure.\nTickets booked, I scout for hostel dorms to live. Two reasons - budget\
  \ stay and opportunity to meet people.\nAs I awaited the overnight train, my heart\
  \ was pounding - fear, anxiety, hope, doubt, excitement.\n\" Why was I doing this\
  \ ? .. A dorm stay.. really ?..Would it be safe ..? What if something went wrong\
  \ ? \"\nAs I reached Pondicherry the next morning , I realised that a lot of the\
  \ fear had dissolved.\nThe hostel was nice and the host, David, a nice young chap\
  \ who had just recently started this dorm. \nDavid says there are no girls in the\
  \ dorm yet. Apart from himself and a friend,only two other guys occupied the mixed\
  \ dorm room. So  a request was if I could occupy one of the beds in the mixed dorm\
  \ room, the other air conditioner had a problem. Okayyyyyy... here begins my journey..\
  \ my first dilemma.... what choice do I have... for now freshen up... move around\
  \ a little and make a decision by night if I want to find another place.  Thankfully,\
  \ clean dorm, lovely bunk beds each with a charging point and reading lamp , kitchen\
  \ , living area, clean washrooms. Relief!\nInterestingly, David an ex IT guy, had\
  \ the dream job, dream MNC and  dream location. But home called and he gave it up\
  \ all to get back to his roots. This dorm was his take on replicating the travellers\
  \ hostel concept from his travels across Europe. David told me I could find breakfast\
  \ places across the street. I stepped out scouting for the local small places. I\
  \ didnt want a typical restaurant.  I crossed onto the street on the opposite side\
  \ and found a lot of these tiny outlets where people sold home cooked food and all\
  \ the locals were regulars. I stepped into one . Run by a middle aged couple. Just\
  \ about two chairs. They had the Tamil staple - idly , pongal, vada.  Since I speak\
  \ Tamil , language was never a problem. \nThe idly, vada, sambar, chutney and pickle\
  \ .....simple...yumm and just melts in your mouth. The best part .. served by akka\
  \ (elder sister) with so much love, like  your mother would at home. And the conversation\
  \ to keep you warm at heart.  Cost - Rs.20/- can you believe that!!  I return..\
  \ filled tummy and heart promising to return everyday of my stay for breakfast.\
  \ And I did that. Each of the five days, I had my breakfast served lovingly with\
  \ a special pickle .. which was reserved for me lest it got over (She freshly made\
  \ that pickle everyday and served me extra). Such  warmth! \nDavid helped me rent\
  \ a bicycle so I could move around. I made sure I had a cap and bottle full of salt\
  \ lime water because the heat was unforgiving. I rode my cycle through the day ,\
  \ through the market place, the lovely lanes of the french colony, the beach promenade.\
  \  A walk through the french  town makes you marvel, love and just gaze at those\
  \ beautiful houses and structures. I return to the hostel exhausted but satisfied\
  \ and settle into one of the beds in the girls dorm (without a/c ). Day 1 - tick\
  \ off. Peaceful. Happy. The people, the places, the emotions, the friends I made,\
  \ the moments in the next four days requires a whole chapter to cover. It can all\
  \ be summed up to the smile I had on my face and peace in my heart as I sat in the\
  \ bus on my way back home. A dream conquered, but just the beginning!"
