Text: "Backpackers are forever in search of a good bargain. Perfecting the art of\
  \ bartering, but never able to negotiate on the non-refundable 86,400 seconds we\
  \ all receive each day. When I was a child I wished time away. As an adult, all\
  \ I want is more time. My six month solo South American adventure was quickly extended\
  \ to eleven months, giving me the illusion of extra time. My bucket list growing\
  \ longer with each destination I ticked off. \n\nConstantly on the move, I was guided\
  \ by curious impulsivity, electing to take planes instead of local buses just to\
  \ \u201Csave\u201D time, enabling me \u201Cmore\u201D time to explore. Yet, my anxious\
  \ mind didn\u2019t rest, busy mapping and re-mapping a seemingly (to the untrained\
  \ eye) sporadic journey. \n\nMy focus never deviated from ensuring I allowed ample\
  \ time to reach the epitome of all natural phenomena. Amigo\u2019s bailed along\
  \ my plight up the Atlantic coastline of Brazil\u2019s northeast state Maranhao.\
  \ They all acknowledged insufficient time for the estimated two day mission of uncertain\
  \ scheduling and unmarked 4x4 pick up points from Jericoacoara to South America\u2019\
  s hidden gem; it\u2019s very own Sahara desert, Len\u1E09ois Maranhenses. Fuelled\
  \ with wanderlust- seeking the unworn paths, I was pulled uncontrollably to the\
  \ challenge and exclusive nature of this national park, mostly forgotten, in Brazil\u2019\
  s plethora of iconic landmarks. \n\n\u2018Len\u1E09ois,\u2019 Portuguese for \u201C\
  bedsheets,\u201D eloquently encapsulates the 100km mirage of rolling white sand\
  \ dunes, separated June to September by various shades of blue lagoons. Beneath\
  \ the midnight blue and turquoise waters, home to unique fragile ecosystems, lays\
  \ impermeable rock preventing liquid from sifting through the silky, refined grains.\
  \ \n\nHaving stayed the night at Casa do Profesor, a hostel in the main access point\
  \ town Barreirinhas, I was fortunate to meet the wealth of knowledge Profesor himself.\
  \ Never one to dismiss a local\u2019s advice with the promise of an abundance of\
  \ freshwater crystal lakes, I couldn\u2019t resist opting for the unpublicised 3\
  \ day, 50km hike, over the \u201Cinsta pic\u201D day trip.\n\nNow, as I sit at the\
  \ pinnacle on top of the epicentre of silvery dunes, expanding the entirety of the\
  \ horizon, finally it feels like time stands still. I reflect on the days spent\
  \ hiking in unrelenting desert heat, followed by the reward of sprinting down, arms\
  \ flailing, jumping childishly into the refreshing lagoons. A dreamy smile covers\
  \ my face, anticipating tonight\u2019s plan to bathe under the moonlit galaxy. \n\
  \nThe baron fields cause a double blink at the sight of a rouge goat roaming aimlessly.\
  \ I am assured that the few natives permitted to remain within the protected borders\
  \ since 1981 will eventually recapture and feed him. Welcomed into the natives humble\
  \ thatched huts, my group of three receive the full cultural immersion; sleeping\
  \ in crocheted hammocks and dining on sacrificial chicken they have kindly prepared\
  \ for us.  \n\nAdmiring the geometrical landscape, the sun warmly setting on my\
  \ skin, my eyes are mesmerised by the evolving watercolour canvas of red, pink and\
  \ yellow being painted in front of me. I feel my state shift internally as the laughter\
  \ from my perfectly intimate group becomes distant. I am hypnotised as handfuls\
  \ of dust seep, like an hourglass, gently through my fingertips. The whistling wind\
  \ is a crucial element to the continuous reshaping of this place. It persuades the\
  \ sand against its innate sinking nature, ensuring for remarkably effortless ascents.\
  \ I gaze down at my naked, tired feet, massaging soft granules between my toes.\
  \ For the first time I\u2019m appreciating the intricate bone and ligament structures,\
  \ which hold and carry me at any speed, to anywhere I desire.  \n\nI recognise a\
  \ compilation of sensations, excited fluttering butterflies in my stomach, my breath\
  \ naturally expanding into my lower abdomen and warmth filling my heart with pure\
  \ happiness. Time is still. My fast paced nomadic past and future plans are temporarily\
  \ silenced. I am aware that my 86,400 seconds are nearing the days end. Like a big\
  \ hug, I am surrounded by this transcendent paradise, fostering an authentic connection\
  \ and making time for what matters most; a relaxed body, a peaceful mind and a nourished\
  \ heart."
