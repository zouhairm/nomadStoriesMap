Text: "I was volunteer in London, one day my manager came to me and asked \"Beyza\
  \ there is a project in Sicily would you like to go?\". When I heard Sicily, I started\
  \ to wonder because however I hear the name and was sounds familiar, I didn't know\
  \ anything about there. Checked from Google maps, pictures and it seems like historical\
  \ paradise to me. So the day came up of the journey, with all excitement we jump\
  \ to the plane. We arrived Catania, after leave airport the smell of the island\
  \ was like a parfume from sky. I started to like there in that moment more and more.\
  \ \nWe arrived our small city Spadafora in Messina region when I got in Hostel,\
  \ everyone was smiley, friendly like in my country I was so happy with that energy.\
  \ On the morning I saw the sea from my window, is beautiful and infinite, when I\
  \ go down to breakfast I noticed there is no salty food everything is sweet, everything\
  \ is like a desert. I thought I might be really in paradise. That was so strange\
  \ for me because we are even eating olive in our breakfasts in my country. Except\
  \ project times we enjoy the beach, sun, open music and learn african dance from\
  \ african girl. The month was beginning of April and weather was really good especially\
  \ after London's grey and sad sky. I love the sun, the feeling of taking that warm\
  \ of sun under my skin. Do you know what is most interesting part? I used to go\
  \ my grandmother's garden and eat fruit from the trees everything was just so beautiful\
  \ and natural and after 15 years later I felt the same in this island. Because everything\
  \ was just so virgin and fabulous. Same climate and same fruits, vegetables with\
  \ my mother city. My grandmother taught me to eat body of one thorn maybe you will\
  \ not even think to touch, even see that plant on the way. Taught to do bride from\
  \ dutchman's breeches and I saw, I did all of them in Sicily my friends from north\
  \ was shock and admire because they never see such a things like that. I ate my\
  \ mandarin from tree and taste was like never in the supermarket food. I loved it.\
  \ It took me all these to past. \nExcept all these Sicily has great history which\
  \ make me amazed. When I walk between historical houses, the way going to castle\
  \ was tight and old, the beauty of this place you always see nature, sea, and history\
  \ together. What people can want anymore from life? \nOne day we went to restaurant\
  \ on the top of the mountain and sea was under our foot, we ate sea food. I tried\
  \ octopus first time there and I wish to be up on the clouds in that moment. Eating\
  \ good for me is a therapy and in those 7 day I can say honestly my body refresh\
  \ itself. You say Palermo, I say Milazzo, they say Messina everyone will say something\
  \ after see Sicily. People, food, nature, history you can find everything together\
  \ in one place so what you still waiting for?"
