  \ counter of Pacific Missionary Airways (PMA) surrounded by\nawkwardly shaped parcels,\
  \ meandering passengers and chaotic swirls of activity.\nI don\u2019t have a permit.\n\
  Manta rays and mandarin fish first beckoned me to the main island of Yap in the\
  \ Federated States of\nMicronesia (FSM) and its world-class scuba diving did not\
  \ disappoint. But why limit myself to one of its\nmore than 600 islands sprawling\
  \ the Western Pacific Ocean when the remoteness of the outer islands of\nUlthi is\
  \ so alluring. Ulthi has no commercial air service, but the island of Falalop does\
  \ have an airstrip,\nso I reserved a seat on PMA\u2019s twice weekly charter flight.\n\
  Amos, the pilot, continued and my heart sped, \u201CNo one knows you\u2019re coming?\u201D\
  \ I frantically scrolled\nthrough my confirmation emails. The Adventure Lodge, the\
  \ only guesthouse on the island, has been\nclosed for guests since the typhoon and\
  \ was currently partially inhabited by the International Migratory\nOrganization.\
  \ It took some logistical creativity, but I was able to secure a room with a deposit.\
  \ There\nare also no restaurants on the island, so food arrangements also needed\
  \ to be made ahead of time,\nwhich I also thought I had worked out.\nPrevious days\
  \ conversations with many locals started replaying in my head. Most Yapese expressed\n\
  shock to hear I would visit the island when I didn\u2019t know anyone there. The\
  \ natural follow-up question I\ngot was, \u201Cwhat are you going to do when you\
  \ are there?\u201D My insatiable curiosity drew me there to just\nexperience the\
  \ island, but is my visit in question?\nAmos grabbed the phone and questioned \u201C\
  who can we call?\u201D to the other pilot, who was weighing\nluggage, produce and\
  \ passengers to calculate the correct weight-balance for the small planes. Ramon,\n\
  the head of the Council of Tamol who provides the permission, happened to be at\
  \ the air strip this\nmorning. I headed off to speak to Ramon. Our conversion started\
  \ strained, but I was allowed to plead\nmy case and the agreed upon solution was\
  \ I would visit the Council upon return to Yap to get the permit\nretroactively.\
  \ Glad I had avoided an international incident!\nI stepped over the tightly tied\
  \ palm fronds and stack of carefully racked eggs in order to slide into my\nseat\
  \ behind Amos. I remained memorized by the natural beauty of where I was the entire\
  \ flight. I\nstared at the ever-deepening blue hues of the ocean and was simply\
  \ joyful when I landed on this unique\nisland. It felt like the entire population\
  \ of the island was there to greet the plane and my adventure was\nabout to begin.\n\
  While I didn\u2019t realize I needed a permit, I did know that it is customary to\
  \ visit the Chief while on the\nisland. Flushed with the recommended gifts of betel\
  \ nut and instant coffee from Yap, and help of a\nlocal girl, I was able to get\
  \ a meeting with the Chief the following day. I was struck by his physical\nstature\
  \ and intrigued by his minimalistic traditional garb as we began our chat sitting\
  \ on A-frame that\nwas the \u201Cporch\u201D of his dwelling. Super typhoon Maysak\
  \ decimated the island over two years prior and\nthe cleanup and rebuilding continues.\
  \ Communications systems were one of the first things replaced\nand the island had\
  \ been enjoying fast, reliable Internet service. However, the system had been down\n\
  \nsince the night before I arrived. We spoke of its importance for communication\
  \ on and between the\nislands.\nAs I left the Chief, I caught myself fighting back\
  \ a smirk as I realized that I somehow have traveled\nhalfway around the world to\
  \ \u201Cget away from it all\u201D yet I had a similar day to that of a typical\
  \ day at\nhome. You see my job as a lobbyist back in the States includes talking\
  \ to political leaders regarding\naccess to the Internet.\nI came to this remote\
  \ island to experience the differences yet was more moved by the similarities and\
  \ ended up feeling right at home."
