Text: "Have you ever felt that moment when your heart beats harder when you are finally\
  \ able to communicate with someone in another language? That moment when you watch\
  \ something on television about another cultures and another languages and you are\
  \ enchaneted by such diversity? These are emotions that multilingual abilities provides.\
  \ From a very young age, I watched movies and listened foreign songs that made my\
  \ cultural taste exceed the borders of Brazil, my country. Not for nothing, at the\
  \ age of ten, I told my father that I would like us to move to Paris, the capital\
  \ of France, for watching on television how beautiful and harmonious the city was.\
  \ From then on, my fascination for another languages and for another cultures has\
  \ only increased day by day. \nCurious, at the age of fifteen, I decided to go to\
  \ a language school to study English. At the same time, I studied Spanish and French\
  \ on my own at home using the internet. In language school, we learn not only grammatical\
  \ and lexical content, but we also receive from teachers some knowledge about the\
  \ culture and history of countries that have English as official language. As I\
  \ was learning the three languages, I used to watch foreign films only with subtitles\
  \ in Portuguese, the official language of Brazil. Sometimes, I tried to watch without\
  \ subtitles, that is, I tried do watch movies in English without instant translation.\
  \ Although I didn\u2019t understand, I felt excited, because it was a challenge\
  \ to go beyond the limits of language to gain cultural understanding.\nIn my college,\
  \ just to illustrate, we had received many foreign students. In my class, particularly,\
  \ we were favored by the presence of a Beninese woman, that is, we have a friend\
  \ born in Benin, a country located in the western region of Africa. Over the past\
  \ year, we have become close friends because we have built a study group with other\
  \ students in the class to help us with academic activities. As she improved her\
  \ Portuguese through her experience in the group, we also learned a little French.\
  \ In other words, if we were not open to the \"different\" and to the new, we would\
  \ never have developed our autonomy and our ability to learn a new language. Surprisingly,\
  \ she knows several people from neighboring countries to her own. Through this experience,\
  \ we were introduced to people who have English, for example, as their mother tongue.\
  \ Sometimes we would devote a whole day to language learning. She helped us with\
  \ French, we helped her with Portuguese and her friend taught us English. We thus\
  \ form a true network of global citizenship through multilingual abilities. As a\
  \ result, there was the development of positive interdependence, as well as the\
  \ destitution of individualism, because we learned more about culture and the day\
  \ by day life of people from another countries. \nIn the past, my family did not\
  \ understand a word of a foreign language. Today, because of the technological experiences\
  \ - apps and language teaching websites - and because of their lifes experience\
  \ they have learned important lessons. The first one is \"bonjour\", \"\xE7a va\"\
  , \"hola\", \"qu\xE9 tal\", which means \"hello\", \"tudo bien\" in French and Spanish,\
  \ respectively. The second lesson is that language and cultural understanding can\
  \ be the way to reduce distances between people and cultures. The third lesson is\
  \ that technology and innovation create new ways of connecting us to the world.\
  \ The fourth and last lesson is the importance of preserving the linguistic and\
  \ cultural particularities of each society. In the face of all this, I am hopeful\
  \ that the next generations will live in a better world more just, egalitarian and\
  \ democratic."
