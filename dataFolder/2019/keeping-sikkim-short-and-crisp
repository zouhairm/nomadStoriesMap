Text: "Summer is usually the long gap which leads to self-contemplation to inter/volunteer/travel/sit\
  \ back home and sleep. Another such summer for me was the Summer of  2018. I completely\
  \ made my mind to sit back at home, binge watch everything on Netflix and keep eating\
  \ till I again worry about my weight until I met my college mate in my home city\
  \ and we planned a complete in prompt to one week vacation in 5 days. \nSo we planned\
  \ in merely 5 days! \n\nAll we did was research online on what can we actually cover\
  \ in a week. We decided we would visit Sikkim in the north east of India. As it\
  \ is always cold, summer is the ideal time to attract tourist from all over India.\
  \ So the primary concern for us was \u2013 getting reserved transportation ticket\
  \ to and fro by train and some nice empty lodging option. These were the first things\
  \ we need to book before proceeding for any further bookings. \nI booked the train\
  \ tickets, but we were on the waiting list 30 and 31, hoping for people to cancel\
  \ their tickets so that we could get a confirmed one. And for our lodging option,\
  \ we roughly decided a map of the route we would travel. We planned of 2 nights\
  \ in Gangtok and 2 nights in neither North Sikkim/ West Sikkim. \nWest Sikkim won!\
  \ (as North Sikkim required special permit for both foreign tourists as well as\
  \ Indians, and the season would make it worse to obtain that permit) \n\nLet\u2019\
  s talk about Sikkim and how to reach it first,\nNearest airport \u2013  Pakyong\
  \ Airport (newly constructed airport with sky shooting airfares)\nNearest bus station\
  \ \u2013  Tenzing Norgay Bus Terminus (3 hours away from gangtok with irregular\
  \ bus to Sikkim)\nNearest train station \u2013  New Jalpaiguri Station (4 hours\
  \ to gangtok with direct jeeps/ shared jeeps)\n\nIt was already the day we had our\
  \ overnight train journey from Kolkata to New Jalpaiguri Station, and our tickets\
  \ were waiting list 4 and 5. We were already telling each other not to worry as\
  \ there will be other times we could travel. Just 5 hour before our train, we got\
  \ a message that it is confirmed! We hopped on a cab and went for our train. \n\n\
  Our itinerary in glance, \nDay 1 \u2013  reach New Jalpaiguri, transit to Gangtok\
  \ and check in out hostel \nDay 2 \u2013  hike around Gangtok, explore the beautiful\
  \ cafes and pubs \nDay 3 \u2013 travel to Borong (W Sikkim) and check in our homestay\
  \ \nDay 4 \u2013  visit the hot spring, hike around \nDay 5 \u2013 enjoy with the\
  \ locals and our host family \nDay 6 \u2013 travel on Siliguri and reach New Jalpaiguri\
  \ Station\n\nWe reached New Jalpaiguri Station on the first day, as we came out\
  \ there were a bunch of people (who were drivers) asking if we wanted to go to Darjeeling\
  \ or Sikkim. We had to ignore all the way as taking a shared jeep from a place called\
  \ \u2018junction\u2019 is always better if one is travelling on a budget and it\
  \ seriously takes no time to get filled. \nTip. Shared jeep is one of the way locals\
  \ travel and fares are usually bargained. Prices are somewhere between  \u20B9200-\
  \ \u20B9300.\n\nIt took us 3 hours to reach the capital of Sikkim, Gangtok with\
  \ a halt on the way. It was cold and then we took a cab to our hostel. \n\nTagalong\
  \ Backpacker\u2019s Hostel \nManisha - 096500 91759\n\nThis hostel was a gem we\
  \ found with super clean rooms, and the plus point was that the owner of the hostel\
  \ is herself a huge traveller. She just lives upstairs. \n\nAnother great thing\
  \ in Sikkim is the Alcohol (it is dirt cheap) !\nIt was the third day already, and\
  \ we were off to Borong, a secluded village with the transportation being a bit\
  \ fussy, as we had to change, wait and walk a lot. But the journey was worth it\
  \ with the beautiful view. \n\nWe reached our homestay and out host welcomed us\
  \ in the proper Gurung way! It was a wonderful experience and our host family was\
  \ as warm as our own. \nPhoto Series of Borong - mahalaxmibhattacharyya.myportfolio.com/borong-photo-series"
