Text: "Inhale. Exhale. A small billow of mist escapes my mouth, my boots slowly crunch\
  \ against the volcanic landscape as I continue to make my way towards the sheer\
  \ slopes of the Red Crater, the highest point on the Tongariro Alpine Crossing.\
  \ Moisture clings to my skin, small droplets of water fall from the looming clouds\
  \ that blanket the intimidating peaks of Mt Tongariro and Mt Ngauruhoe. I think\
  \ back to the warm scenes at Lake Taupo. A typical summers day in the North Island\
  \ had all but vanished when I made my way towards New Zealand\u2019s famous volcanoes.\
  \ An average temperature of 0 degrees at Red Crater flashed on my phone, strong\
  \ winds, unpredictable weather. I was ready, I had travelled so far, and I was determined\
  \ to finish the 19.4km hike. \n\nAs I trek throughout the Mangatepopo Valley, closer\
  \ towards the alpine country, a continuous flock of people walk the opposite way.\
  \ I begin to wonder if the mountains fury was too much to be reasoned with. I politely\
  \ ask one of the cloaked figures why they are turning back. The well-prepared hiker\
  \ looks at me and my ill-equipped gear and laughs. Fine lines spread across his\
  \ rosy face, evidence of nature\u2019s forces. \u201CThe weather is no good up there,\
  \ too dangerous\u201D he exclaims, trying to be heard amongst the powerful wind.\
  \ \u201CI recommend you turn back\u201D he declares as he repositions his hiking\
  \ poles and commences his journey of defeat back to the distant Mangatepopo carpark.\
  \ \u201CThank you\u201D I call back, pulling my ski jacket over my face to reassure\
  \ myself that all was okay. Mentally, I had battled mountains before, I was not\
  \ going to let anything get in the way of achieving my goal. The steady incline\
  \ gradually turns into a steep path of stairs that entwine their way up the volcanic\
  \ terrain of Ngauruhoe\u2019s foothills. Inhale, exhale. My lungs beckon me to stop,\
  \ but my heart pushes me onwards. \n\nPockets of ice are scattered amongst the vast\
  \ expense of the South Crater. Warning signs of volcanic eruptions don\u2019t hinder\
  \ my desire to make it to the top. The wind whips furiously against my face as I\
  \ claw at the chain that is etched into the bones of the earth. With effort my cold\
  \ fingers manage to pull myself closer towards reaching my destination. Stepping\
  \ from the steep cliff, I push ahead, up the sharp, strenuous incline of the Tongariro\
  \ Crossing. A dark, grey screen clouds my vision, throwing me into an emptiness\
  \ that was all too familiar. I knew the never-ending slopes of the Red Crater were\
  \ only a few feet away, one wrong step and it would be all over. I gradually move\
  \ upwards, never sure of when or if I would reach the 1886m summit. I was leaping\
  \ into the unknown, an unknown of what would be on the other side of this frightening,\
  \ yet exhilarating situation. \n\nA tall, dark figure in front of me slowly begins\
  \ to descend, a wave of relief washes over me, I\u2019m so close. As I hike to the\
  \ highest point of the crossing, the threatening wrath of wind and clouds slowly\
  \ departs. The warmth of the sun\u2019s rays begin to filter through the dissolving\
  \ fog. It kisses my skin as if welcoming me to the other side, another side of the\
  \ unpredictable weather New Zealand has to offer. The pristine emerald lakes sparkle\
  \ like natures jewels, the sacred Blue Lake glistens in the distance. Plumes of\
  \ white steam dance out of the vents that cover the rugged terrain of Mt Ngauruhoe\
  \ followed by the sickening smell of sulphur. A reminder that the ground beneath\
  \ my feet is active.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m the king of the world\u201D shouts a man\
  \ standing near me. He slowly clenches his aching hand and shoots them into the\
  \ sky. The joy of making it to the top of the Tongariro Crossing evident on his\
  \ face. I smile. I clench my tender fingers into a fist and push them into the sky,\
  \ reaching up towards the sun. \u201CI\u2019m the queen of the world\u201D I cry\
  \ as I look down at the raw and powerful beauty that mother nature has to offer."
