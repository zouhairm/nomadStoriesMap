Text: "It was the start of a year so planned and perfect, nothing could fault it.\
  \ The anticipation for the known was felt as loving as a warm coat on a winters\
  \ day. Nothing could change the course of this year, nothing at all. \n\nUntil a\
  \ sudden change in direction made the warm winter feeling icy. Suddenly I was aware\
  \ that my foot had stepped into a new season and I was not aware. What could have\
  \ been viewed as misfortune now presented adventure. The known became quickly boring.\
  \ And oh, thank goodness it did not work out. \nThe unknown started to feel like\
  \ the warmth of the rays coming out to say hello on a summer morning. Suddenly my\
  \ whole body responded, the light always calls for a response. It felt like summer.\
  \ \n\nBut now I needed to explore another summer place. Home was not enough. I have\
  \ never ventured far from home. Travel has always been local and I have found summer\
  \ in every mountain of South Africa and I have cooled my sun kissed African skin\
  \ in seas wilder than my curly hair. But, more was calling my name. \n\nTravel somewhat\
  \ a impossible ask, but now calling my name. I must go. There are lands that know\
  \ my name that ask for me. There are oceans who envy my wild desire for adventure,\
  \ there are skies begging for my gaze and there are people I still need to meet\
  \ in this world. My whole being says let\u2019s travel, the pocket laughs mockingly.\
  \ But, where there is a will, there is a way. \n\nI\u2019m chasing summer. The sun\
  \ will wait for me I\u2019m sure. He will always rise. I will taste travel and it\
  \ will be sweet."
