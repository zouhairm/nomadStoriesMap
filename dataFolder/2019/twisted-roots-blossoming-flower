Text: "It was a hot day in the northern Croatian countryside. The sun sizzled my skin,\
  \ but the sight in front of me made my hairs stand. I was visiting the Jasenovac\
  \ Concentration Camp memorial during my last few days exploring Croatia. The camp\
  \ was used by the Usta\u0161e army during WWII, but the physical building no longer\
  \ existed. In its place was a vast field of green, uncut grass and a large monument\
  \ in the distance. The strong breeze whistled around me, interrupting the deafening\
  \ silence. I walked towards the monument, following a rugged path made of misaligned\
  \ stones leading to a creaky bridge over a still pond. \n\nFrom afar, the monument\
  \ represented a controlled flame flourishing from a narrow tunnel made of grey concrete.\
  \ It contrasted the summer horizon of vivid blue sky and green grass. I walked,\
  \ tripping often on the path. Upon approaching the monument, I was struck with awe.\
  \ It was incredibly large and intricate, yet simplistic in design. Up close, my\
  \ perception of the monument changed; it looked like a blossoming flower with a\
  \ prominent stem and twisted roots. It had no name nor explanation. To me, it represented\
  \ life flourishing in a space once intended solely for death. It was powerful. \n\
  \ \nI made my way into the museum, which was intimate and dimly lit. The first element\
  \ of the museum that caught my attention was a large book slightly torn at the binding.\
  \ The pages were dusty and aged, as apparent by their yellow tint. As I slowly turned\
  \ them, I realized that the book was not intended for sign-ins. The book was a list\
  \ of every victim of the Jasenovac genocide. On each page, there were at least sixty\
  \ names. The thick book contained over a thousand pages. As I read, I felt my breathing\
  \ slow and my heart sink. The book took an incredibly large and impersonal statistic,\
  \ 99,000 victims, and allowed me to trace over the name of each and every lost life.\
  \ Each tragedy.  \n \nI continued exploring the museum, taking in every fact and\
  \ figure, only to be followed by the vision of the names. The simple book deepened\
  \ my ability to empathize with a history to which I had no tie. My only prior experience\
  \ with Croatia consisted of rocky beaches, waves of clear turquoise water, and shores\
  \ crowded with tourists. Jasenovac had no beaches. Instead, I found quiet air, bullet\
  \ holes in the bricks of my hostel, freshly baked Burak, and quiet drives through\
  \ the tranquil countryside. I let out a deep exhale, overwhelmed yet extremely centered.\
  \ I decided to step out for fresh air. \n\nI had nowhere else to go, so I followed\
  \ the direction of the setting sun. The sun cast a deep orange hue onto the dense\
  \ forest across the path. Close to the gravel road leading away from the monument,\
  \ I found a small memorial for the victims. It was a shrine of hundreds of entangled\
  \ rosaries with Orthodox crosses hanging from a hand-carved cross made of splintery\
  \ wood. \nThe soft light of the summer sun illuminated the small memorial. Underneath\
  \ the beads, I saw something nestled in the dew-covered wild grass: a fresh, red\
  \ rose.\n\nThe petals looked soft, vibrant, and healthy; the flower had to have\
  \ been left within the past 24 hours. All of the victims of Jasenovac have been\
  \ dead for at least 70 years, yet their memories were still being honored by loved\
  \ ones. I looked back at the rosaries and gently brushed over the beads with my\
  \ hand. It was in that moment that I discovered something I did not expect to find\
  \ at such a gut-wrenching cite: I found love in its purest form. It was a kind of\
  \ love that transcended generations of time and distance. A  Love that touched me\
  \ deeply despite a cultural and personal disconnect to the death camp. \n\nOn the\
  \ bus ride back to the city, I sat comfortably in silence. I reached around my neck\
  \ and traced over my necklace: a rosary that was given to me by my grandmother.\
  \ In Puerto Rican culture, elders ordain their grandchildren with the rosary as\
  \ a symbol of resilience, faith, and love."
