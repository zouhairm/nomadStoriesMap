Text: "How the tea tastes in the morning, while seeing the rising sun from seating\
  \ on a mountain?.. Its divine !! The steam reaches your lips, makes you feel the\
  \ warmth aroma of it\u2026and you cannot resist your hand to take a sip of tea.\
  \ As your mouth filled, it feels like millions of tiny buds in mind has awaken and\
  \ as you gulp it down, the sensations of rising buds emerges into your entire body\
  \ and that makes you feel  surmounting.\nThe more you feel this at the time of sunrise,\
  \ the more you can connect with the rising sun. The cooing and chirping of birds,\
  \ breezy wind making you feel alive by touching forehead, cheeks, nose tips, neck,\
  \ fingertips. You feel it more when you tenderly close your eyes, feeling the breeze\
  \ passing by your closed eyes.\nAll these tiny acts becomes treasurable when you\
  \ are seating at the place from where you can see sun rising. It spots simply and\
  \ quietly.. like a small kid hiding himself behind curtain but, still, he is showing\
  \ his face with a tiny smile on his face. Gradually it starts appearing and lastly\
  \ takes place in the sky, like a king who deserves the sovereignty after winning\
  \ the battles \u2026and it\u2019s a moment to wait for life time\u2026  \nThe warmth\
  \ of the rays releasing from Sun makes your body go heavenly crazy. Goosebumps gets\
  \ on you and makes you forget everything for a moment. It becomes an absolute peace\
  \ and then you see it all. The amount of visuals you see are mind boggling. The\
  \ vast expanse of sky in front of you filled with indefinite width and the land\
  \ beneath you assuring you are a tiny part of this cosmos yet you feel, you are\
  \ heavenly lucky to be a part of such spectacular sight. \nUsually, feeling such\
  \ mornings are nearly impossible in day-to-day scheduled life. But it really gives\
  \ elite experience in the duration of scheduled break or on the trip..\nFirst one\
  \ is always special. So my first one will be always special for me because it has\
  \ built the base for my love towards mountain trekking and travelling. My experience\
  \ to see the rising sun started, when I went on a trip to Shimla and then Dalhousie.\
  \ My day started with a cup of tea and seating on a place, from where I could see\
  \ rising sun from the mountain. That spent moments of 10-15 minutes was more auspicious\
  \ than any other time of the day.\nThe hill station is a dream come true for trekking\
  \ fiends as it offers the best trekking paths for beginners. As you pass through\
  \ the verdant surroundings, you can't resist yourself from soaking in the tranquility,\
  \ that smell of dry leaves and calmness of the place.\nMy Shimla Trip gave me an\
  \ unforgettable memories of ..mornings at mountain, living in a wooden cottage,\
  \ chance to meet new people, to connected with the local people, glimpsing their\
  \ ability to manage life with little resources yet to have positive approach about\
  \ place and constant efforts to maintain the beauty of place. \nWhat I gained during\
  \ Dalhousie trek was astonishingly lovely trek side away foliage's which made me\
  \ speechless while walking and observing it. All trees, plants, tiny shrubs were\
  \ seemed so magical when the sun rays were falling on it. They shaded from lush\
  \ green to light green and sun rays were like a fingers of God, tenderly touching\
  \ entire flora !!\nOn the way to Kalatop from Lakkarmandi (a specific place) was\
  \ a living heaven for me, where I got a chance to see the amazing views of the beautiful\
  \ landscapes. The surrounding was so spectacular at trek path, that I could not\
  \ content my self by just gazing  it and walking ahead. Each time I saw something\
  \ attractive at lush of trees and plants, my legs would  just trapped there and\
  \ the view had a such magical aura, which was mesmerizing me completely. \nWaking\
  \ up to see beautiful mornings in such green mountains, are those memories which\
  \ has fresh views even today. When I close my eyes and remember those scenes it\
  \ flashes in front of me, divinely."
