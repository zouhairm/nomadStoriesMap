Text: "I slowly and silently ascended the east tower of the castle. I was trying to\
  \ locate any unlikely guest in this immense building but the only sound I could\
  \ hear was the one of birds singing through the windowless openings of the wall.\
  \ The sun was about to set behind the snowy mountains of the Tian Shan and its warm\
  \ orange light contrasted with the dismal feeling of the empty building. Most rooms\
  \ were open. Inside often, a lone bed without sheets or a wooden nightstand offset\
  \ of its initial position were only adding to the impression of quiet abandonment.\
  \ Nothing was broken or dilapidated though. It felt as if people just left, someday,\
  \ and and everything froze in time.\n\n\tI schlepped to my room on the third floor\
  \ which, on the opposite, looked perfectly fine. It was the only place where light\
  \ seemed to be working. Water flowed through taps and heat was on. The warm weather\
  \ of august did not really justify it even though nights around Issyk Kul lake could\
  \ still get chilly. I leaned over the window, a real one this time, from where I\
  \ could grab some fruits on the apple tree growing under. From there I could see\
  \ most of the facility; two other medieval towers, the main entrance, the two waterslides\
  \ spilling in an empty concrete pool, the vegetable garden which ,oddly, seemed\
  \ to have been taken care of and even a strange looking futuristic flying saucer\
  \ supported by a massive pillar. A metal chain was locking the small door at its\
  \ base. It did not look like anybody ever slept in this room halfway between the\
  \ vestige of the communist artistic past of the country and the futuristic vision\
  \ of 80's american hollywood.\n\n\tGradually everything started to disappear before\
  \ me as the light decreased. That moment confirmed my feeling of loneliness when\
  \ I realised no light escaped from any of the buildings. How could it be different\
  \ in that small remote village? You'd really have to get lost to end up in a place\
  \ like this and I only decided to stay here beacause it was getting too dark to\
  \ hitchike anymore.  I was not worried though, merely curious. The country had proven\
  \ a thousand time to be safer than any european city. There was no reason this place\
  \ would be different despite its gloomy appearance. \n\n\tThe village did include\
  \ a couple of small restaurant and the castle was apparently the only place to sleep.\
  \ Fortunately, the town had internet access and I could do some reasearches. As\
  \ I expected, the castle was not listed anywhere as a hosting place. There was aparently\
  \ no way to make a reservation and no phone number. I even managed to gather some\
  \ pieces of information about the place which apparently was built for a local mafia\
  \ boss who wanted to make the village a party-goer's heaven. But he got shot and\
  \ everything was left in state. Once again, I did not worry. It explained though\
  \ the attitude of the owners, an old couple with their middle-aged son, who looked\
  \ more as guardians than hosts and who did not seem to care given the ridiculously\
  \ low price they charged me for the night.\n\n\tI was about to go to bed when a\
  \ couple windows lighted up. It was the ball room. I had explored this level earlier\
  \ and it consisted in a small renaissance floor almost empty spare the few chairs\
  \ and a straight piano. I recognized one of the \u201Cguardians\u201D. He sat at\
  \ the piano and started to play. He was probably used to being alone and may have\
  \ forgot about my presence. But I did not mind. He was not playing very well but\
  \ after so much calm I welcomed the music smilingly.\n\n\tFor the past two weeks,\
  \ I had spent my time in almost total silence wandering in the kirghiz mountains.\
  \ I had travelled countless hours on the back of my black horse, lived amongst nomads\
  \ which I didn't know the language sharing their kumis, slept in their freezing\
  \ yurts in the high pastures... I was not used to a normal bed anymore. Nor to music.\n\
  \n\tBut I fell asleep in a minute."
