Text: "\u201C This only happened because you let it, just like how you always let\
  \ someone walk over you like a doormat. If mum were here instead, she would never\
  \ let this happen.\u201D As soon as the words flowed out of my mouth, I felt my\
  \ face burning. \n     During our first night in Paris, My dad and I were lining\
  \ up to get to the top of Eiffel Tower. That was our first time in France, the final\
  \ destination of our very first trip to Europe. The early summer air was hot but\
  \ much more tolerable than the humidity we were used to, coming from the tropics.\
  \ \n     The symmetry of The Eiffel Tower\u2019s architecture was like honey to\
  \ my eyes. I took countless panoramic pictures from different angles while we queued\
  \ underneath the tower, with the soft sunset lighting serving as a natural filter.\
  \ \n     There wasn\u2019t a dull moment during the line. A street comedian was\
  \ walking around and teasing or mimicking the unsuspecting tourists, occasionally\
  \ jump-scaring them from behind. Most of his victims had a good sense of humor,\
  \ laughing or giggling along the hundreds of audiences. I put a Euro in his hat\
  \ after a round of applause. While the line was long, it wasn\u2019t nearly as overwhelming\
  \ as the line for the Empire State Building. As the sun went down, a breeze accompanied\
  \ the wait. The weather became rather pleasant.\n     Just when I thought everything\
  \ was all sunshine and rainbows, a father with a five-year-old looking daughter\
  \ got very close to us. At first, I was suspicious of the possibility of them being\
  \ pickpockets, just like a woman with two kids attempted to steal from me in Paris\
  \ metro a few hours ago. Eventually, I figured out they were trying to cut queue,\
  \ as they occupied the space of a party that was right behind us. The people behind\
  \ us subtly stared at the duo, while the father was still attempting to glide past\
  \ my dad and me.\n     I have a strong principle of never letting anyone cut in\
  \ line. I looked at them firmly, crossed my arms and widened the stance of my legs,\
  \ preventing them from cutting in. However, there was a gap on my dad\u2019s side,\
  \ and the duo slipped on through it. I was furious and went over to confront the\
  \ pair. My dad added fuel to my fire, as he stopped me and told the father everything\
  \ was all right. It obviously was not, and I was not going to let this slide. Therefore,\
  \ I decided to throw a tantrum towards my dad instead.  \n     The atmosphere froze\
  \ when I blurted out my words. The African-American couple behind us witnessed the\
  \ incident, and started apologizing, even though they did nothing wrong. I was making\
  \ random strangers uncomfortable while hurting my dad at the same time. \n     Despite\
  \ the drama, it was our turn in less than fifteen minutes anyway. However, that\
  \ was the longest fifteen minutes in my life, filled with silent tension. The silence\
  \ went on even after we got on top of the building, immersing in the views of the\
  \ lights and Arc de Triomphe. I could tell how much my dad was hurt by how he avoided\
  \ my eye contact. I wanted to apologize, but I was stuck in the mindset that I was\
  \ not wrong in the situation. My ego and self-righteousness stopped me from apologizing.\
  \ I forgot that often times being good and kind is more important than being right.\
  \ \n     Certainly, I did not expect to find the stunning view of the Parisian skyline\
  \ to be in the list of my worst moments and least-favorite memories. \n     I owed\
  \ my dad an apology. I want to tell my dad that I\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s go to\
  \ Eiffel again and I promise to make it better this time."
