Text: "I will take advantage of my fluency in Portuguese and Spanish to make a story\
  \ about the different cultures that the peninsula had been through centuries. The\
  \ Moorish history of portugal was part of the unique identity this country features.\
  \ I will make connections with locals in different cities and towns to follow the\
  \ origins of the habits and customs of locals that would be passed through the Andalusian\
  \ era. This topic is extremely interesting provided that it is tackled in a professional\
  \ way. The out come of this project would be a real masterpiece of a kind and would\
  \ trigger the interest of many other travellers and researchers to follow the same\
  \ path. I will start my story from Covadonga in Asturias , which was the last strong\
  \ hold in the hands of the Gothic kingdom defending their country against the Arabic\
  \ invasion in the 8th century. This was the start point of the later Christian kingdoms\
  \ ( Leon and Galicia) that continued the lengthy reconquista wars against the Moors\
  \ until 1492. The kingdom of Galicia would conquest latethe Moorish part of the\
  \ Iberian peninsula, which is now Portugal, while Castile along with Aragon and\
  \ Navarra would conquest the southern part of Spain or what is known now as La Comunidad\
  \ Andalusa . For many people, the reconquista was a holly war between two different\
  \ religions, however I see it as the longest civil war that   took place within\
  \ the same nation in all man history. I wanted to show that the cultural heritage\
  \ of this rich area of the world is way more profound and stronger than any violence\
  \ or war that happened in this area. The Convivencia , which is a spanish word for\
  \ coexistence,  was created in this part of the world for the first time between\
  \ the three religions ( Christendom, Islam , and Judaism). Coexistence is a value\
  \ that the needs to embrace and promote in our days. In my quest, I will shed the\
  \ light on thos common features that remained from all cultures and traditions of\
  \ the people that called Iberia home for centuries. Flamengo, bullfighting,cuisine,\
  \ Language, even names are all rich material for my research that would reveal lots\
  \ of interesting and fun facts that might be mentioned or published for the first\
  \ time. My plan is to start from Lisbon, then I will head north to Coimbra which\
  \ has a great long history along with one of the oldest universities in the world.\
  \ Right after Coimbra I will keep heading north to Portu then to Santiago De Compostilla,\
  \ where the famous cathedral that is believed to the remains of Santiago, to which\
  \ hundreds of thousands of visitors come walking every year. Then I will head east\
  \ to Salamanca , then south to Badajoz and the province of extremadura. From Badajoz\
  \ I will head south to Albufera and Algarbe region in southern Portugal before I\
  \ head east to Seville the capital of Andalusia. Continuing north east to Cordoba\
  \ then to Granada, ending the quest in Malaga. Throughout this great trip I will\
  \ keep revealing the uniqueness and cultural richness of this part of the world.\
  \ I will write about history, monuments, people, religion, and customs. \nI think\
  \ that the overall outcome of this project would be fruitful and beneficial for\
  \ every one involved in it."
