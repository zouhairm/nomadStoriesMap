Text: "The most influential person in my life has been a man who spoke a language\
  \ I couldn\u2019t even understand. I was standing in front of a church in Argentina\
  \ with all of the other law and human rights volunteers. It was a cold, windy night\
  \ but looking around I considered myself lucky. To my right, there was a gathering\
  \ of approximately one hundred homeless people waiting to get inside the church\
  \ where they could catch a break from the icy wind and lose themselves for a couple\
  \ of hours in a movie. \nThe other volunteers in my group were standing in front\
  \ of me talking while waiting to get in. Shivering, I shoved my cracked hands into\
  \ my pockets and looked to my right. Lined faces with sunken eyes all fixed upon\
  \ the doors of the church surrounded me. No matter how cold I was, they surely had\
  \ it worse. While the rest of the volunteers continued talking amongst one another,\
  \ I turned to the man waiting in line to my right. \xA8My Spanish is atrocious,\
  \ and he\u2019ll never be able to understand it,\xA8 I thought to myself. After\
  \ a moment\u2019s hesitation, I smiled at him and asked him about his life. \nHe\
  \ turned to me, a look of surprise on his face, and politely answered. A bead of\
  \ sweat formed on my forehead as I listened intently (but uncomprehendingly) to\
  \ his replies. By the time the church doors opened, pink had crept into my cheeks\
  \ and my heart was racing. I felt bad that my level of Spanish had limited our conversation;\
  \ however, soon that thought was pushed out of my head as I made my way inside and\
  \ started handing out food. While a young girl reached her thin arms into my basket\
  \ for a second helping, someone touched my shoulder. Turning around, I saw that\
  \ it was the same man whom I had spoken with earlier. He looked deep into my eyes\
  \ and started speaking very rapidly in Spanish to me. I couldn\u2019t understand\
  \ what he was saying, but I was held in place by those sad eyes.\nEven as another\
  \ volunteer ran over to translate, I couldn\u2019t hear anyone but him. Tears welled\
  \ in his eyes and his voice cracked. He was gripping both of my hands in his, and\
  \ even though I couldn\u2019t understand his words, I understood his meaning. I\
  \ blinked back my own tears because I thought I had no right to cry; I had food\
  \ to eat, a place to call home, and a coat on my back. All this man had was in his\
  \ torn backpack which he was now taking off. With a shaking hand, he reached into\
  \ it and pulled out the only food he had: a pack of sweets he had saved for himself.\
  \ His cheeks glistened when he handed it to me, and I understood in that moment.\
  \ He was thanking me for treating him like a human being. Just the simple act of\
  \ saying hello to him led this man to feel like a person again. I had reminded him\
  \ of his humanity, and he was thanking me with his most valuable possession. I reached\
  \ up and hugged the man who showed me the importance of one of the most basic lessons\
  \ of life: simply to treat others with kindness."
