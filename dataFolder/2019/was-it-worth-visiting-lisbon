Text: "I was lying on the bathroom floor still in my pajamas, crying. Seconds before,\
  \ I knocked on the bathroom door where my husband was, holding back the tears. I\
  \ didn\xB4t want the kids to see that, at least for that moment. At least not that\
  \ way. They would soon know, of course, because they would need to go back to school\
  \ in Brazil as soon as possible. But I needed to cry not in front of them for a\
  \ moment. More than once, I read and reread the e-mail message: our student visa\
  \ in Canada had been denied, under a fragile justification. I would study for a\
  \ year in a College and the family would accompany me in that experience of living\
  \ in another country. My passage had already been bought, the program coordinator\
  \ was waiting for me. But it was denied. It was August 2018. \n\nI fell into sadness\
  \ for a while. But suddenly, in October 2018, my husband won two tickets to an event\
  \ in Lisbon, the Web Summit. It happened 2 weeks before the event and we didn\xB4\
  t have much time to decide and organize the trip. Portugal? I had already visited\
  \ Europe in 2014 but never had a special attraction to know Portugal. And what about\
  \ our commitments in Brazil? The budget? Would it be a viable plan? Would it be\
  \ worth crossing the ocean for just six days long? So yes, we decided to take this\
  \ trip.\n\nBeing in Lisbon was like entering a time warp where I could breathe history,\
  \ the Tejo river, the Atlantic ocean, special and unique neighborhoods with old\
  \ buildings... I could know the Bertrand Chiado, the oldest bookstore in the world\
  \ that is still working, located at the typical Portugal-street Garrett, in Chiado.\
  \ What an inspiring place! And many other places that I could experience. And what\
  \ can I say about the \u201CPastel de Bel\xE9m\u201D? I ate a lot of them! By the\
  \ way, when I go back to Portugal, I may hire extra luggage to bring a shipment\
  \ of them.\n\nI don\xB4t usually cling to roots or ancestors - it's definitely not\
  \ my business - but over there I could see that there is a connection of those people\
  \ with me indeed. Maybe it comes from the desire to seek something that is not known\
  \ for sure what it is, like who has an internal compass guiding. Maybe from the\
  \ simple sake of venturing. Of course, there is also a historical debt because many\
  \ of the European achievements took place at the expense of cultural looting and\
  \ imposition on the inhabitants of the American continent and it was no different\
  \ with the history of Portugal with Brazil. But all I can say is that was incredible.\n\
  \nThe Web Summit itself was an amazing and enriching event but the big issue was\
  \ balancing the lectures and the tourism in just a week. I got totally immersive\
  \ days but it was just a couple of days and I want more. Was it worth doing? \"\
  Everything\u2019s worth doing if the soul of the doer isn\u2019t small. Whoever\
  \ would go beyond the Cape must go beyond sorrow.\" (Portuguese Sea, Fernando Pessoa).\
  \ After all, what is it to cross an ocean in an airplane compared to the caravel\
  \ voyages that the Portuguese used to do in the sixteenth century?"
