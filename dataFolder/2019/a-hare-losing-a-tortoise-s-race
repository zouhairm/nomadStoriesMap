Text: "Flying terrifies me. Despite the facts that turbulence is a pocket of air of\
  \ which you cannot die, I\u2019ll dread take-off, wait for the captain's alleged\
  \ air flight time, then press start on my watch to countdown minutes until survival.\
  \ It\u2019s irrational, but it\u2019s my reality. My other reality is that I love\
  \ to travel; new destinations and being immersed in culture once the turbulence\
  \ stops. On the ground. \nPlus, my best friend was getting married in Romania. \n\
  \nThe first flight was horrible. Small plane. Zero leg room. Turbulence. A hare\
  \ wouldn\u2019t even fit; let alone a 6\u20191 hare. Newark Airport isn\u2019t the\
  \ grandest of airports and we had a three-hour layover; leaving us with the only\
  \ option of drinking wine. Wine helps. Wine soothes the notion of turbulent death.\
  \ Bottles later, it was time to board the biggest plane I\u2019ve ever seen. Not\
  \ just wine-big, but actually huge. Hares could multiply all over the place. The\
  \ flight was grand. Romana, the dutiful best friend and world traveler, life-checked\
  \ me from time to time; I poured another glass.  \n\nHours later, I pressed stop\
  \ and put down my glass. But this story isn\u2019t about my irrational fear of flying\
  \ and my wine crutch. This story's about a Hare losing a Tortoise\u2019s race. \n\
  \nThe minute I entered Europe, sensory overload kicked in. Everything was new and\
  \ different. I wanted to soak it up. As a true American Hare, I hit the ground running.\
  \ With only ten days in Romania, three in Amsterdam, and five in Paris, I wasn\u2019\
  t going to miss anything. My list of monuments and museums, the tangibles, stretched\
  \ to 42 bullet points of substantial history and tourist traps. All of which I\u2019\
  m thankful for, but my list also includes: homemade wine at my best friend\u2019\
  s fianc\xE9\u2019s parents\u2019 house; happy hours with flambeed orange J\xE4germeister\
  \ shots; running up steep hills after midnight and knocking on European strangers\u2019\
  \ door for a bathroom; park walks; walking just to walk; random interactive art\
  \ installations; morning runs in three different countries; everything Red Light\
  \ District; afterparty moments with old friends and new; strangers who became friends;\
  \ solo hikes; eating McDonald\u2019s on the Eiffel Tower\u2019s lawn because on\
  \ the last day, I had negative $6.42 to my name. And topping the list, my best friend\u2019\
  s wedding.\n \nWhile flipping through 1,000+ photos for obligatory social media,\
  \ I realized this was now a memory. Instead of remembering the tangible list of\
  \ monuments, I wanted to remember how long dinners took. How dinner conversations\
  \ arose when waiters didn\u2019t bother you every five minutes; fighting the American-Hare\
  \ mindset to judge their \u201Crudeness\u201D and realizing they\u2019ve given the\
  \ gift of time. I wanted to remember being terrified the whole time but ecstatic\
  \ at the end; remember being the first American in a Romanian Taxi. \"That\u2019\
  s how I feel in America,\" Romana commented on my na\xEFvet\xE9. I wanted to remember\
  \ the feeling of not hearing English; remember learning more Romanian in ten days\
  \ than seven years of staring at a French blackboard; remember putting down the\
  \ camera while touring the Louvre. Live now, buy the postcards later. I\u2019m forced\
  \ to remember my best friend\u2019s wedding, because despite the 7+ hour celebration,\
  \ no photos exist past the first thirty minutes. We lived with each other in the\
  \ moment, not through a screen. \n\n\u201C\u2019Do you ever get anywhere?\u2019\
  \ he asked with a mocking laugh.\u201D Do you ever get anywhere being a Tortoise?\
  \ Or are you just lazy?\n\nPacking things into every hour leaves no time to meet\
  \ strangers, no time to enjoy meals, to walk ten yards instead of driving, to put\
  \ down the phone, to talk, to date, to live. It isn't lazy to be a Tortoise, but\
  \ there\u2019s no time to be a Tortoise. The only option is to half-ass our way\
  \ through life as a Hare.\n \nI no longer want to be the American-Hare who works\
  \ to live and loses the race chasing the wrong finish line, but instead I want to\
  \ be the tortoise who wins the right race; starting every morning with an espresso\
  \ and croissant, surrounded by conversations and a list of adventures.\n \nResist\
  \ the Hare\u2019s instinct and be the Tortoise, surrounded by other Tortoises."
