Text: "I blew up my life, hopped on a plane, and landed in Turks & Caicos for a \u201C\
  Celestial Boho\u201D camp (not that I had any idea what that meant). I don\u2019\
  t do things last minute, I\u2019m a planner. Half the fun of a trip for me is the\
  \ research and advance preparation, but not this time. Given the exhaustion and\
  \ uncertainty I was feeling, I almost didn\u2019t get on that plane\u2014almost.\n\
  \nMy feelings flowed quickly from being exhausted to overwhelmed to elated from\
  \ the dingy airport restaurant to the shuttle to the ferry. We were there to explore,\
  \ make new friends, discover new passions, and most importantly chase the Milky\
  \ Way.\n\nParadise unfolded before my eyes as we passed remote beach after remote\
  \ beach with not a person in sight as we ferried to North Caicos. The ocean seemed\
  \ to sparkle in a special way. The sky and water blended together and let off a\
  \ pink-ish hue. I longed to dive in.\n\nI cried during my introductions that first\
  \ night as I explained what I was going through. I received hugs from strangers\
  \ that felt like friends. That night, tired as we were, we took yoga mats outside\
  \ and laid down for our first star lesson. We took in the constellations, their\
  \ stories, and connected with each other and the night.\n\nDuring the days we relaxed,\
  \ beach hopped, and held or attended lectures on our passions. There was Dragon\
  \ Cay, a spectacular beach in Middle Caicos. There were talks about survivorship\
  \ of cancer, car crashes, and 9/11.\n\nThe rocks that form Dragon Cay are sharp\
  \ and jut out of the crystalline waters in a dangerous yet inviting way. From far\
  \ away it looks almost like a Jurassic creature was beached. From up close you could\
  \ climb the sharp rocks if you dared. Here we found a secret, deep pool that only\
  \ a brave few jumped into\u2014I went first.\n\nOur second night, long past midnight,\
  \ as we began saying our good nights, our camp leader asked us who wanted to go\
  \ star chasing. All we had to do he said was drive a few miles and then just lie\
  \ down on the highway (it was truly that unpopulated). We clambered into vans and\
  \ were off. Since the highway lights were on, we kept driving and driving, as light\
  \ interferes with the magic of the Milky Way.\n\nWe arrived in total darkness. Stumbling\
  \ from the van, we shuffled to the beach directed only by the ocean\u2019s waves.\
  \ Gasps escaped our mouths as our eyes adjusted and beheld the most magnificent\
  \ tapestry of stars. As we lay down, I felt the cool, clear Milky Way penetrate\
  \ my soul.\n\nWith less light pollution, the skies remain as they should: dark.\
  \ You lose yourself in that darkness, but I don\u2019t think you can be afraid when\
  \ the stars act as your guide. Transcendent is the word that comes to mind. You\
  \ leave your body on a still-warm sandy beach while your mind and soul are elsewhere.\n\
  \nThe stars burn brighter there. And it\u2019s not just twinkling stars, you see\
  \ planets too. Nature puts on the most spectacular show every night and most of\
  \ us simply forget that it\u2019s there. It was like being awake during the most\
  \ beautiful dream, like nothing I\u2019d ever experienced before.\n\nOur group did\
  \ a guided meditation on the beach that night. We were told to each pick a star\
  \ and never lose sight of it. When you focus so singularly on a star it grows bigger\
  \ and bigger while everything else fades away. At the end we were asked what word\
  \ we felt, when looking at our star. Mine had shouted freedom.\n\nI left feeling\
  \ shattered. I came back renewed."
