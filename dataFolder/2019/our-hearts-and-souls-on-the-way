Text: "We are staying behind, I complained, after a crowd of adventurous souls who\
  \ passed in front of us. \"I would rather stay behind than leave my heart and soul\
  \ on the way\", said my partner, who had survived a heart operation some time ago.\
  \ The path was tough. We are almost 4200mts above sea level. Every breath there\
  \ makes yourself aware of the height. But the difficulty made you feel that, at\
  \ the end of the day, you can handle more than you think. \nSometimes silent, sometimes\
  \ with a word of encouragement, sometimes filled with laughter. Exciting as a rollercoaster\
  \ and calm as a lake. Always surrounded by beautifulness. Sun and rain. Mountain\
  \ and jungle. Every day was different, with ups and downs, as life itself. \nEmpty\
  \ ruins. Full hearts. A heavy bag, but above all, heavy of memories. Two hundred\
  \ meters and we are there: the Dead woman's pass. Not a really encouraging name,\
  \ isn't it? It felt like an eternity. What a relief! We are there. But there is\
  \ no much time to stop. We have to keep on moving. So does everybody and everything.\
  \ I look now at the picture and it is, both, the worst and best picture I have.\
  \ \nWhoever experiences it, will say: it was a learning process. Not because of\
  \ the incredible stories told by our guide, Santiago, about that brave and miraculous\
  \ civilization, it was really about our own selves. Learning to love, to keep up,\
  \ to be patient with the others and to live with our own thoughts. Learning to know\
  \ that there is much more to discover than what is advertised. \nImagining how it\
  \ must have been at that time and what it could have been. Admiring the greatness\
  \ of nature and human's creation. \nThis path teaches you that there are hidden\
  \ treasures along the way, if you are willing to take the challenge. You know that\
  \ you can not give up, after all you have been through. You see the \"portadores\"\
  \ and are reminded that always somebody has it, unfortunately, harder than you.\
  \ \nKnowing that many people will never experience it makes me somehow sad. Everyone\
  \ should. Santiago walked the trail more than seventy times and found each time\
  \ details that took his breath away. So did we, on every step. \nAlways waiting\
  \ to get to the end makes you feel that is worth having something to wait and to\
  \ fight for. But in the end, you realize the beauty is on the way, which never stopped\
  \ surprising you. Five days waking up at five a.m with coca-tea in front of our\
  \ tents. Dinner on a tent that feels cozy as home. The sunrise and that llama that\
  \ starred more photos that day than his girlfriend. The details are what makes it\
  \ unforgettable. Walking side by side, even more when it gets harder. Meeting all\
  \ sorts of people on the path. \nYou also comprehend, the path was nicer because\
  \ it was shared. \nI never told him this, but, even when he did not want it to happen,\
  \ we -both- left our hearts and souls on the way. \nGuess what? It was completely\
  \ worth it."
