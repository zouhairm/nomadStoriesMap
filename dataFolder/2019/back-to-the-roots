Text: "San Basilio de Palenque is only half an hour away from my hometown, Cartagena\
  \ de Indias (Colombia). Yet, it took me twenty years to get there.\n\nAn academic\
  \ task turned out to be the perfect excuse to finally meet the first free town of\
  \ America, the one I\u2019ve believed to know only through my history classes, but\
  \ the truth is, that it\u2019s been around me this whole time and I didn\u2019t\
  \ noticed.  \n\nWhat I knew about Palenque so far was the kind of information you\
  \ find online: that was the area where hundreds of fugitive slaves came looking\
  \ for freedom and after fighting hard against the colonists, they got it.  \n\n\
  Only then, they were capable of showing the african legacy that run through their\
  \ blood and developing a culture that remains until today and includes their own\
  \ language -a mix between spanish, portuguese and bantu- and unique rituals. But\
  \ to really understand it you definitely have live it.\n\nIt\u2019s hot, very. The\
  \ neglection of the government towards the place can be noticed just by walking\
  \ on the unpaved roads all over the town. Despite of that, people seem to breath\
  \ a cheerful air: it\u2019s the Drums and Cultural Expression\u2019s Festival, the\
  \ three-day event that celebrates Palenque\u2019s african heritage and traditions.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s still early but everybody is out. Children playing on the streets,\
  \ women braiding each other hairs and men watching them as they listen to loud music,\
  \ acclimatizing themselves for the night performances. \n\nAs I wait for them as\
  \ well, I walk a little while with Juan, a local guide from the city. He seems to\
  \ know everything about the place where he was born. \u201CWhere did you learn all\
  \ that?\u201D, I ask, \u201Cjust living\u201D, he says. \n\nHe tells me he\u2019\
  s also a passionate dancer. \u201CSince I was a little kid, I felt interested on\
  \ learning how could I tell stories not only with my mouth but my body\u201D, he\
  \ claims. And that\u2019s what dancing means to him, a particular way to keep the\
  \ traditions. \n\nIn Palenque, everybody seems to be proud of their roots. In fact,\
  \ in one of the houses we passed by, we saw a colorful wall that said \u201CI love\
  \ being black\u201D in big letters, and there was also a lot more homes decorated\
  \ with other sentences written in Palenque\u2019s native language.\n\nIt\u2019s\
  \ noon, so we get to the main square of the town. There, under the inclement sun,\
  \ there are tables, chairs and improvised kitchens serving lunch in the middle of\
  \ the street. So, we sat and had our traditional soup with sugar-cane water in the\
  \ outdoors. We are in the middle of a Festival so nobody cares. \n\nA few meters\
  \ from there, there\u2019s also a braid making workshop, where the palenqueras teach\
  \ the technique and have contests where they reward the most creative hairstyle.\
  \ Braids where used by women in the past as a strategy to show, in a very discreetly\
  \ way, the escape routes to the fugitive slaves, that where visible through their\
  \ scalp. Now, they are a cultural reference in the region. \n\nAs the sun goes down,\
  \ everybody gets together in the main square while local musicians play folk music\
  \ and dancing groups take the stage. Tradition is still alive but I can tell it\u2019\
  s not the same, it has evolved.\n\nIt got out from Palenque and now is everywhere.\
  \ It can be seen just by looking people dancing all over the place: natives and\
  \ foreigners, both in the same place following the rhythm of the artisanal drums.\
  \ There, I realize that maybe we are not so different, perhaps the colors of our\
  \ skins are, but our souls vibrate the same when we listen to the beat. \n\nNight\
  \ comes. Music is the universal language and dance the way we raise our inner voice\
  \ and communicate with each other. We have this quality since we were born. This\
  \ are our ancestors too. I finally get it. Yes, San Basilio de Palenque has been\
  \ around me this whole time and I didn\u2019t notice, but most important, it\u2019\
  s also been within."
