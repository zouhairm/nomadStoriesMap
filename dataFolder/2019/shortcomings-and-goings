Text: "\u201CWe have ten minutes left so I suppose we should start heading down\u201D\
  , said Misa. \u201CThe bill? Grazie!\u201D,requested Davie. They both looked at\
  \ me.\n \u201CReady?\u201D\n\u201CLet\u2019s go!\u201D I exclaimed with a half-smile\
  \ as I pushed back my chair and grabbed my postcard. As we made our way back to\
  \ our tour group I fleetingly glanced back at the raised water well in the middle\
  \ of the square, elongated my neck to better assess beyond the neatly bricked archways\
  \ that we passed and squinted up at the luminous sky to see if I could spot any\
  \ bells shining at the top of the towers. As I popped a piece of mint bubble-gum\
  \ into my mouth to remove the taste of pesto sauce from my palette, I realised that\
  \ I had eased my hunger but my craving for a magical experience had, once again,\
  \ been left unsatisfied.\n\nI felt defeated.\n\nI have never walked as confidently\
  \ as I did through the airport on the day that marked the beginning of my first,\
  \ and long- awaited, solo- trip. Although, describing my new endeavour as \u2018\
  solo\u2019 is a bit of a stretch considering it was spent with a tour group I did,\
  \ at least, get to figure out the workings of an airport unaided. I will never forget\
  \ the powerful feeling of strutting past strangers in my layered all-black outfit,\
  \ head held high whilst enjoying the rhythm of my slightly heeled boots clicking\
  \ against the tiles paired with the droning wheels of my trolley suitcase. \u201C\
  Remember to always stick to your tour manager and never leave your bag unattended\u201D\
  , said my mother. \u201CI know\u201D, I snapped at her, annoyed at having my supermodel\
  \ moment interrupted. \u201CYou have said this to me a million times already!\u201D\
  . I suddenly felt a flash of sympathy. After all, her only child, a sheltered and\
  \ pampered one, was leaving the country for the first time unaccompanied and unprotected.\
  \ Her jaw was stiff and her fingers tightly clutched her handbag as if to prevent\
  \ herself from grabbing onto my collar and dragging me back home instead. Walking\
  \ through the security gates felt like the opening of my cage and I felt ready to\
  \ fly, literally and figuratively, towards my quest for complete independence and\
  \ unsupervised adventure.\n\nThe lush green hills of Tuscany, en route from Rome\
  \ to Florence, do not look nearly as breathtaking from pictures taken through a\
  \ bus window as they do with the naked eye. \u201CCan I have your attention?\u201D\
  , requested Chiara, our tour manager. \u201CWe are going to be entering the medieval\
  \ town of San Gimignano. We have an hour to spend here for lunch before we have\
  \ to start heading back towards our destination.\u201D Our meeting point was determined\
  \ and the group dispersed.\n\nThe narrow pathways, the stone buildings, arched windows\
  \ and extending alleys. The atmosphere felt electric. I marvelled at the mere existence\
  \ of such a fantastical place- akin to what I\u2019d seen only in movies- and was\
  \ instantly transported into my conceptualisation of the Middle Ages \u2013 rosy-cheeked\
  \ children running through the streets, their hands brushing the stone walls, jaded\
  \ woman gossiping about their bothersome husbands whilst leaning against a window,\
  \ a young girl flouncing about with a basket of freshly bought vegetables. I looked\
  \ up at the looming tower, curious as to what those centuries before me would have\
  \ admired.\nSuddenly, as if beyond my control -\nto my new companions- \nI uttered\
  \ - \n\u201CWhat do you all want to do?\u201D.\n\nThat I had become my own obstacle\
  \ throughout the trip was excruciating to digest. Never did I expect to find nor\
  \ face my very own shortcomings- from the constant need for approval, to the dependency\
  \ on others to determine my actions, to the inability to break away from a crowd-\
  \ all appeared magnified due to the removal of the security blanket. I departed\
  \ from Italy with more than just souvenirs and instagram-worthy pictures.\n\nI will\
  \ return to San Gimignano. Accompanied or not, I will walk beyond the water well\
  \ in the town centre to climb that tower and wholly relish every sight the glorious\
  \ Tuscan landscape has to offer me. On that day, I will be victorious."
