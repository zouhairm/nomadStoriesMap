Text: "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, when past is as fascinating as its future\n\
  \nBefore the oil was discovered, the people of this lands were making a living from\
  \ fishing and pearls trade. Emirati people are very resourceful and wisdom stories\
  \ are passed down the future generations.\n\nLanding to Abu Dhabi, the capital of\
  \ United Arab Emirates, was a great experience itself. The International airport\
  \ is one of the newest and biggest in the region, but no so crowded as the one in\
  \ Dubai. \n\nTaking a taxi from the airport is very simple, in case you didn't require\
  \ transport offered by the hotel. I had an amazing trip to the hotel we've booked\
  \ downtown, even though we arrived at midnight, we felt that we are in a cosmopolitan,\
  \ safe place, yet very authentic. The highway is illuminated and has beautiful dates\
  \ threes separating the desert from us. This amazing entrance in the city will stay\
  \ in my mind forever.\n \nMost of the buildings, hotels in the downtown are skyscrapers,\
  \ but the beach resorts as Jumeirah Beach Hotel, or Park Hyat Hotel on the Saadiyat\
  \ Island, not far from the main island, or Yas Island hotels, offer an incredible\
  \ 5 star service and access to the Arabian Gulf beaches.\n\nSaadyiat beach, which\
  \ is located on the island with the same name, it's a pristine beach with crystal\
  \ turquoise water, just 5 minutes by car from the downtown. The beach is public\
  \ but you have to pay an entrance fee, which includes the umbrella and chaise lounge.\
  \ If the budget is not a problem for you, have a look at the Saadiyat Beach Club,\
  \ they offer day pass, pool and beach access with lunch/brunch included. \n\nRecently\
  \ opened, Saadyiat Rotana Resort and Villas, Jumeirah at Saadiyat Island Resort\
  \ or Rixos Ultra All Inclusive, are all located on the beach and just few minutes\
  \ drive to Louvre Museum Abu Dhabi. After a lavish breakfast at one of the luxurious\
  \ resorts, I would suggest you visit the art and civilization museum - Louvre. A\
  \ masterpiece of modern world which displays artworks from around the world, with\
  \ particular focus placed upon bridging the gap between Eastern and Western Art.\
  \ Interesting to know is that the museum is designed as a seemingly floating dome\
  \ structure, with a metallic ceiling that reflects light into the museum like a\
  \ natural palm frond.\n\nWe visited Abu Dhabi on April, before the Ramadan started,\
  \ weather was pleasant, and we had no restrictions at all on food and beverages.\
  \ Keep in mind, that Muslim countries are celebrating the holly month, during which\
  \ Muslims undergo a period of fasting. Ramadan it depends on the moon cycle so dates\
  \ move around from year to year.\n\nIn order to feel the vibe of this city, we went\
  \ to the Madinat Zayed shopping center, frequented by locals and tourist as well.\
  \ This place has it all, souvenirs, traditional gifts, Arabic perfume or gold jewellery.\
  \ I had my name written in Arabic and I wear it in a nice pendant. The locals use\
  \ to buy their traditional clothing here, so if you are ready to bargain and wish\
  \ to purchase for women- an abaya dress or for man - Kandura, male national dress,\
  \ you will not regret it, and you may use it the next day when you will visit the\
  \ Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque.\n\nTo make this experience unforgettable, we went for\
  \ dinner on Corniche, the Manhatttan of UAE. \nAt Etihad Towers, Ray's Grill was\
  \ waiting for us with great views and unbelievable food. Yes it's expensive, but\
  \ is fine dining, the ambiance is superb and the restaurant is located on the 63rd\
  \ floor!! Spectacular views offered from the glass restaurant and top notch service.\n\
  \nFor history and pearl lovers, do sail on the traditional Jalboot, one of the world's\
  \ most graceful sailing cratfs. Your local guide will explain how the Emirati forefathers\
  \ dedicated theirs lives to pearl diving. \nWe ended our trip with Arabian Nights\
  \ Village, nestled in Al Ain desert, which features Emirati themed accomodation.\
  \ This place is pure essence of old Arabia, and the best way to experience the beauty\
  \ of the desert, also try the camel ride and dune walks.\nWe will go back soon."
