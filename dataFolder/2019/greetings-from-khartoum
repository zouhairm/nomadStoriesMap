Text: "It\u2019s the brilliant flashes of teeth that you see first. Smiles widen as\
  \ you move closer. Then it\u2019s the warm embraces, and the quick pecks on the\
  \ cheeks. Various chairs and a colorfully woven bambar are offered to allow you\
  \ rest from your journey. Cardamom-infused tea and fresh hibiscus juice are placed\
  \ at your lap as a matter of urgency. A tray of sweets or dates manifests seemingly\
  \ out of thin air.\n\nEvery single time I entered a house in Sudan, I was brought\
  \ something to eat. In every apartment I visited, a snack or fruit. Small shop owners\
  \ insisted I sip a cup of coffee as I perused jewelry and jalabiyas.\n\nEven when\
  \ just quickly dropping something off at a friend\u2019s place, there was no question\
  \ that I would be coming inside, resting on one of the 20 beds that adorn every\
  \ Sudanese household, and then being served a light meal.\n\nSudanese hospitality\
  \ is unrelenting and omnipotent. It is the welcome \u2014 the very first impression,\
  \ be it the first encounter ever or simply the first one that day \u2014 that sets\
  \ the tone of your relationship with the Sudanese.\n\nI spent 15 days in Khartoum,\
  \ the restless capital of Sudan where the dust never quite settles. People don\u2019\
  t really visit Sudan if they don\u2019t have family ties there. Even the most intrepid\
  \ traveler rarely chooses the bespoke pyramids of Meroe or the inviting entrance\
  \ to the Red Sea at northern Port Sudan as their holiday destination. To be unperturbed\
  \ by unfriendly media coverage and hostile international travel warnings is an anomaly.\n\
  \nMy gracious host Amani \u2013 one of my best friends and Sudanese travel guide\
  \ extraordinaire \u2013 was thus determined to give me an authentic experience of\
  \ daily life in her home country. As her first international visitor, no unrepresentative\
  \ touristy thrills or frills were allowed.\n\nSo every day I sat.\n\nAnd I ate.\n\
  \nAnd I greeted.\n\nOne evening, I was sitting in a small room surrounded by Amani\u2019\
  s beautiful, buoyant aunties. You know these aunties \u2013 the ones whose who smile\
  \ and laugh and chat and gossip to no end. The ones who do everything and nothing\
  \ all at the same time. They talk about everything and everyone, as aunties do.\n\
  \nI had been a hot topic of conversation since I arrived in Khartoum, and I could\
  \ tell I was a hot topic of conversation on this night in particular. I don\u2019\
  t speak Arabic, but years of international work and travel in countries where people\
  \ don\u2019t speak English have taught me how to read context clues. Laughing and\
  \ nodding in my direction means that no one has to say anything for me to know exactly\
  \ what everyone is saying.\n\nOne young girl in the room, the daughter of one of\
  \ the aunties, signaled to me. \u201CShe wants to say something,\u201D the girl\
  \ said while pointing to the auntie sitting to my right. Amani\u2019s cousin \u2013\
  \ this young girl \u2013 would be the translator.\n\nI looked at the auntie next\
  \ to me. Cue Arabic, Arabic, a smile, a gentle hand on my right shoulder, Arabic,\
  \ and then some more Arabic.\n\n\u201CShe says that before you came here, she had\
  \ met some foreigners and Americans. They were not nice. They did not do or say\
  \ nice things to her. But you have changed her idea of Americans. You eat our food\
  \ and you wear our clothes and you sit with us. Now she knows there are good people\
  \ like you.\u201D\n\nI embraced Amani\u2019s auntie and tried averting the gentle\
  \ tears swelling in the corners of my eyes. The boundless hospitality of the Sudanese\
  \ beamed down on me like sunlight upon the Nile. \n\nThe first impression had been\
  \ made, and it would last."
