Text: "I have always wanted to travel and explore but wanted to do it with own earnings.\
  \ After a long wait, one day I managed to get out of my comfort zone and procastination\
  \ to travel solo to Fort Kochi in Kerala; India. A budget trip in public transportation\
  \ and by walking was a beautiful  experience. I was exploring my inner self as I\
  \ walked along the street my prejudice on various aspects were buried in this ne\
  \ beginning.\n\nWith a very simple plan in hand, I headed north, to Ernakulam from\
  \ the Chengannur Railway Station in the morning. It's a three hour journey. O grabbed\
  \ a window seat. There was no rush that day, so there were no many people in the\
  \ cabin. I sat there, called home to say that I've entered the train, or else parents\
  \ will get concerned. In India girls are restricted in many ways and their traveling\
  \ alone is a dreadful dream for every Indian parent. The journey was peaceful and\
  \ I've always loved travelling long distance by train ever since I was a little\
  \ girl. So I watched outside th window looking for the green fields, trees, water\
  \ and bridges. I was worried because I was going to a place which I have never been\
  \ to and I had no idea how I'll figure out my journey once I reach there. \n\nI\
  \ learned from my life long ago that 'fear shall reside in our hearts only until\
  \ we do it. Once you do what seems to be difficult, you will see that the fear that\
  \ you created in your mind was not needed.' But it is undeniable. We will be scared;\
  \ but the fact is, experiencing it in real makes it look simple. \n\nIn this hope\
  \ I continued my journey. I was determined to not take a rickshaw for travel unless\
  \ it is extremely important:  because it could be a waste of money and also I wanted\
  \ to keep the expense to minimum and experience  to the maximum. I reached the ernakulam\
  \ South station and asked people for way to fort kochi. \n\nTo reach Fort Kochi,\
  \ I had to walk to the other side of the road, asking strangers for route to reach\
  \ the bus stop. From there I got a direct bus to Fort Kochi. Whenever I ask people\
  \ for route, I don't keep the question  to a single person. Instead, I ask two or\
  \ three more people to confirm the route. Sometimes the answers  from different\
  \ people differ slightly, may be because some are giving you a short cut to the\
  \ same destination. So you need to look for confirmation and above all, trust the\
  \ so called 'gut instinct' which works when you ask people along the way if the\
  \ route is right (especially if you are walking'). \n\nThere is bus to Fort Kochi\
  \ every 15 to 20 minutes. I got on a bus and in 30-35 minutes, reached fort kochi.\
  \ \n\nEven if the city has been named \"fort'' kochi, there is no fort in the city.\
  \ But there once used to be a fort. The city is famous for the historical Chineese\
  \ fishing net near the sea. Fo me when I reached there, the first glimpse gave me\
  \ an idea of a park. I had no idea where to walk to: but I walked by the \"gut\"\
  \ and I knew I made the right choice when I saw the harbour and large ships making\
  \ horn sound which felt good. I really loved that sound. I took some nature photos,\
  \ and watched the silent water for some time as (one or) two ships passed by. Then\
  \ I just went right and walked along the roads exploring the city, finding out what\
  \ it has to offer,until I realised I lost my way. \n\nI tried to locate myself in\
  \ Google map from the land spot that I marked for myself to bring me back in case\
  \ if I lose my way. That was the Basilica. It was a better idea to not say bus stop\
  \ because there are many. I asked the locals for my way back and reached nearby\
  \ park. Walked along the shore, walked more, enjoyed waves and returned back home\
  \ renewed."
