Text: "Sri Lanka, I\u2019ll never be able to find all the right words to describe\
  \ the life I\u2019m leaving behind. Life in Sri Lanka has meant operating at a heightened\
  \ level of intensity in nearly every way.\n\nDespite living here for nearly two\
  \ years, Sri Lanka has continued to stun me on a daily basis. Beyond the beauty\
  \ of its picture perfect palm tree-lined beaches, sunsets, rolling hills and tea\
  \ plantations, that characterize it on instagram, there is a beauty in the day to\
  \ day life and people here that I will never fully capture with a camera or in words\
  \ that made everyday so special.\n\nThe way I would half-wake up as dawn was breaking,\
  \ to the sounds of chanting from a local temple. The smells of incense and flowers\
  \ in the morning, that brought a sense of calm and serenity to the busy movement\
  \ of cars, horns and music blaring outside and all the tasks and conversations that\
  \ would be swirling in my head about the day ahead. To be constantly surrounded\
  \ by people, chatter and a lack of personal space and privacy everywhere I went.\
  \ The mid-morning kopis (coffees), gossip, and laughing until I cried and my stomach\
  \ hurt about nothing in particular. The tuktuks that moved at the speed of light\
  \ and time that slipped through my fingers, and that I nearly slipped out of as\
  \ we whizzed around traffic. The spices and rice and curry that numbed my lips until\
  \ they tingled. How every memorable moment or problem was always punctuated or solved\
  \ by copious amounts of food or an afternoon cup of tea. All the days that ended\
  \ well past the mind boggling sunsets that ignited the sky on fire. The sounds and\
  \ smell of kottu being made wafting it\u2019s way into the night and signalling\
  \ that it was time to go home. The late night calls that sometimes made it feel\
  \ like a day would never end.\n\nNearly two years which sometimes felt impossible\
  \ and insurmountable, now feels altogether far too fleeting. To be constantly moving\
  \ at a warp speed that brings new meaning to the phrase \u201CSri Lankan time.\u201D\
  \n\nAnd that all of this was so perfectly normal, and that I will now need to find\
  \ a new way to be and a new sense of normalcy.\n\nBut most of all, what made this\
  \ a home that is so heartbreaking to leave is the constellation of brilliant warm,\
  \ kind and most open people who have weaved their way into my daily life and became\
  \ my family in Sri Lanka. A combination of beautiful souls, that won\u2019t be together\
  \ in the quite the same manner of time, space, and intensity again. People that\
  \ I\u2019ve seen work so hard, tirelessly and passionately, to make Sri Lanka feel\
  \ like home to everyone who sets foot here; and to improve and brighten the lives\
  \ and days of so many people. You have certainly had this impact on my own life.\n\
  \nWhile I am leaving with a heavy heart now, I know it is only possible to experience\
  \ such sadness because of the intensity of emotions - joy, laughter, tears, stress,\
  \ time and love that has made living and working in Sri Lanka an experience well\
  \ beyond what I could ever have imagined. I wouldn\u2019t have done it any other\
  \ way. Thank you and much love to everyone who has made this what it was. I\u2019\
  ll see you soon."
