Text: "There are only so many games one can play in a car before losing their freaking\
  \ mind. Watching the waves of trees ebb and flow through the window pane causes\
  \ your mind to play tricks on you as you convince yourself there is a shape outside\
  \ of the window. \n\nTired of listening to every song that had ever been created\
  \ on my phone I turned my attention to my seat partner. She was looking out the\
  \ window and her eyes seemed to still be captivated by the dance of the tress across\
  \ the window pane. \n\nShe had thick, natural, 4c type curls that was pulled into\
  \ a neat bun atop her head. She gave me a slow glance as her brown eyes tried to\
  \ piece together what I wanted from her. When she was finally satisfied she gave\
  \ me a weak wave, followed by a polite smile. She wore a long, thick, grey cardigan,\
  \ despite our travel during the month of July. Aside from her wool cardigan she\
  \ had on a white button up blouse, a crisp pair of navy slacks and unscuffed black\
  \ loafers. \n\n\u201CWhat made you want to sign up?\u201D I asked her \u201CDid\
  \ you jump at the chance to be apart of a real science experiment\u201D \n\nShe\
  \ shook her head, thought for a second, inhaled and let out a deep breath causing\
  \ the tension in her shoulders to dissipate. \n\n\u201CThe money.\u201D She gave\
  \ me another polite smile and we doubled over laughing together. \n\n\u201CI mean\
  \ I can\u2019t blame ya. $15 dollars an hour to be observed for five days, that\u2019\
  s more than I\u2019ll make at a regular job doing overtime doing way more work.\u201D\
  \ \n\n\nShe nodded in agreement and continued to look back out the window. \n\"\
  I'm Kelli by the way,\" I said to her and extended my hand. \n\n\u201CAlice\u201D\
  \ she extended to me a hand as limp as a pot of freshly boiled noodles, her hand\
  \ was damp from palm sweat. We returned back to our perspective positions, she became\
  \ entranced by the passing of tress and I tried to scroll through my playlist again.\
  \ We each had a song that was holding all of our attention. This carried me until\
  \ we reached our destination.\n\nWe finally pulled to our home for the next couple\
  \ of days. I was less than thrilled. \n\nWe jostled out of the bus like a herd of\
  \ athletes eager to play the first game of the season. We all shared a bond from\
  \ pure excitement, and the need to stretch our legs after a 20 hour bus ride. My\
  \ feet sank into the forest floor, decorated by patches of brown and green moss\
  \ like the squares of the dance floor. This dance floor of moss ended at the steps\
  \ of the building. \n\n\nTaking a deep breath we begrudgingly grabbed our things\
  \ and headed into the building.\n\nWe stepped into an eggshell white room with no\
  \ windows in any corner, and the only opening were the doors that led to other parts\
  \ of the house and the door that let out. The intensity of the room caused me to\
  \ squint my eyes even though I knew I was inside. We filled the inside of the room\
  \ adding color to this stark white contrast. \n\nWithin minutes we heard the click-clacking\
  \ of heels coming down the hall. We all looked down the one opening that was before\
  \ us but saw no one coming, the clacking continued. \n\nAnxious chatter filled the\
  \ room at the arrival of our fashionable guest."
