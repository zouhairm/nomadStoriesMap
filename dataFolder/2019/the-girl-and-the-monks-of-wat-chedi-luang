Text: "I watched her take it all in, the ancient, crumbling temple, the ancient stone\
  \ elephants delicately balanced high above us along the temple walls, but she had\
  \ turned away, enamoured with several stone-carved buddhas that were reminiscent\
  \ of children. At just her height, she stood face to face with them and giggled,\
  \ naming each inanimate sculpture and announcing out loud with absolute glee to\
  \ the quiet, sacred space that she now had friends here. The 14th century buddhist\
  \ temple ruins of Wat Chedi Luang in the Old City of Chiang Mai, Thailand meant\
  \ nothing to a five year old, it was human connection she sought in every moment\
  \ possible. \n\n\LAs we rounded a corner, we began to see monks pacing the temple\
  \ grounds, some in groups quietly talking amongst themselves, others solitary and\
  \ pensive. Their robes were bright oranges, yellows and reds. We wondered aloud\
  \ at the meaning of each colour.\n\nThe humidity hung heavy in the air, our clothes\
  \ damp with sweat. We had been exploring for hours and knew by the waning look on\
  \ our daughter\u2019s hot, red face that it was time to go. Towards the exit we\
  \ noticed several groups of young monks sitting around tables beneath a sign that\
  \ read, \u201CWe know you are looking, why not come say hi and ask us a question\
  \ about Buddhism?\u201D  The universe had sent us a message. How often do you get\
  \ to participate in a \u2018monk chat\u2019? Our daughter lit up, realising there\
  \ were friends to make. We sat and spoke with them for hours. They were young monks\
  \ originally from Vietnam, practicing their English with passing travellers, eager\
  \ to answer burning questions about the teachings of Buddha. I had never met a monk\
  \ before. I expected them to be sullen, still, and wise. These were 20-something\
  \ year old young men, sipping smoothies and diet coke, ribbing each other in good\
  \ fun whenever one of them would say a word incorrectly in English. We listened\
  \ intently as they told us why they had short hair, what their different coloured\
  \ robes meant, how they learned through meditation to live a simple life without\
  \ attachments. We asked questions, and they in turn asked us questions. One of the\
  \ monks, a young novice named Ly, did most of the speaking. He had the kindest eyes,\
  \ and could barely keep a straight face when I asked to take his portrait. \n\n\
  The conversation was spiritual, and philosophically deep. There was so much we wanted\
  \ to learn! We glanced at our 5 year old every so often, who had been gathering\
  \ leaves and lining them up on the table, looking up with curiosity now and then\
  \ as she listened. Occasionally she would touch the loose robe fabric of the monk\
  \ sitting beside her. He would smile at her and she would smile back, and return\
  \ her focus to her leaves. \n\nBefore we left, we asked our 5 year old if she had\
  \ any questions for the monks. By now she had been listening to two hours of spiritual\
  \ buddhist conversation, and as a seasoned traveler and \u2018worldschooler\u2019\
  , she knew that all the people we met along our journeys were her teachers in one\
  \ way or another. She looked at Ly, with his gentle nature and wise disposition,\
  \ and squinted in concentration as she twirled her leaves with her fingers. \u201C\
  I have a question\u201D She said. We all fell silent. What an incredible moment,\
  \ I quickly thought. Talking to monks at 5 years old! What wisdom they will hold\
  \ even at their young age. She looked up at Ly, asking very seriously, \u201CWhat\
  \ kind of tree does this leaf come from?\u201D Ly looked puzzled. He returned her\
  \ earnest gaze and answered \u201CYou ask very hard question.\u201D  The rest of\
  \ the monks erupted with laughter, their spokesperson stumped by a 5 year old with\
  \ an ecology question! Our daughter smirked. \n\nWe arrived strangers and left as\
  \ friends, never wondering again about the ancient temple ruins, but feeling a bittersweet\
  \ warmth knowing we would most likely never cross paths again. Our daughter said\
  \ goodbye, and skipped off ahead toward the exit, waving at everyone she passed."
