Text: "I have been to Portugal only once, when I went on a road trip around that small\
  \ European country with my father and my older sister. That was about six years\
  \ ago and it was roughly one week of traveling, which means I don't know the country\
  \ very well. I have always had, however, a deep connection to Portugal: my native\
  \ language.\n\nI am Brazilian and I majored in Portuguese language and literature\
  \ at the University of Bras\xEDlia, in my hometown. Right after my B.A., I started\
  \ my graduate studies in literature. Words are my passion. Traveling is permanently\
  \ a part of my life, as long as I can afford it. I usually travel on a budget and\
  \ try to make the best of a cheap trip. What matters to me isn't going the trendy,\
  \ coolest places, but rather making a connection to someone or something wherever\
  \ I go.\n\nPortugal is the country from which I inherited my mother tongue. As humans,\
  \ there is nothing like our first language. It provides us the structure to communicate\
  \ our views, experiences, and thoughts, therefore deeply interfering with our expression.\n\
  \nLiterature is my field of research, so I obviously love reading Portuguese writers.\
  \ I read not only Fernando Pessoa, but also Herberto Helder and other modern and\
  \ contemporary authors. I also read authors such as Isabela Figueiredo, from Mozambique.\
  \ We are all connected because of our language.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not know\
  \ any of the native languages from the native Brazilian people. We learn our history\
  \ from the European point of view, which puts me in a weird position regarding my\
  \ relation to Portugal. It is a country with a culture I admire and where I feel\
  \ at home, thanks to our language in common; at the same time, their view of history\
  \ is naturally even more eurocentric.\n\nThis ambivalent relation I maintain with\
  \ the Portuguese culture is something I wish to explore. I want to discover their\
  \ points of view regarding our common history and I intend to make an effort to\
  \ understand it - visiting historical places in Lisbon, for example. Even our differences,\
  \ once explored and (hopefully) understood, can bring us closer."
