Text: "Hello. This one is about my happy experience of vacationing in the northern\
  \ state of India, Uttarakhand in December 2018 for 12 days. In October we discussed\
  \ about our preferred locations to travel within India. For us travel is about having\
  \ unique experience and is usually a mix of adventure, relaxation and having good\
  \ food. After exploring our choices between Rajasthan and Coorg we settled on a\
  \ road trip that covers Nainital, Jim Corbett and Mussorie and back to New Delhi.\
  \ We found a good driver friend from an online car rental site who drove us from\
  \ Delhi airport to back covering the above mentioned places. But let me talk specifically\
  \ about the experience we had at Sir Jim Corbett National Park. After 3 days of\
  \ sight seeing in Nainital we checked out to our next destination for some wild\
  \ life experience.\nWelcome to Jim Corbett !!!\nThis park has many entrances. Our\
  \ first evening safari was scheduled on the same day. We reached the meeting point\
  \ from where the open Jeep would take us into the forest at Bijarani gate.\nWe met\
  \ our guides Shubham and Laik who promised us to give the most memorable safari.\
  \ And they lived up to their word. After going around the narrow roads of forest,\
  \ catching the hints from animal behaviors, following the footprints we stopped\
  \ at the dry river side which had many rocks and a small puddles of water. On the\
  \ other end there was a herd of deers grazing away at dried leaves, enjoying by\
  \ themselves. And then we saw some movement behind the grasses where we were waiting.\
  \ And it came out of the hiding. She is truly the most beautiful and majestic animal\
  \ in the jungle. The excitement level had reached it's peak. The happiness of seeing\
  \ a tiger in its own backyard cannot be expressed easily in words (especially what\
  \ we saw!). This particular Tigress goes by the name Sharmili. She walked a few\
  \ paces and sat by at the corner watching it's prey enjoying at the other end. Our\
  \ guide started his engine and slowly took us as close as possible to get the best\
  \ view of the Tigress. She wasn't interested in humans at this time. She was focused\
  \ and planning her dinner. Or may be it's just a play thing for her. By now she\
  \ had decided and she marched silently towards the other end. And then she again\
  \ cunningly sat back to decieve the deers. This time though the deers had made the\
  \ eye contact and were alert for all possibilities. Sharmili sprang upon the closest\
  \ deer but they all escaped. By now all the jeeps in the forest had reached the\
  \ action zone. The tigress turned it's attention towards us now and started walking\
  \ ever so gracefully. She was just a few feet away from our jeep looking at me directly\
  \ while wifey was palpably making the videos. This was surreal. I thanked the Almighty\
  \ for giving this day and in what seems to me the tigress humbly accepted our gratitude\
  \ and respect for her and the animal kingdom. After all we are both His creation.\
  \ She too then bowed and jumped the high wall and walked off again in the jungle.\
  \ Best. Day. Ever. We had 3 more safaris in the following days with lots of birds,\
  \ elephants, deers and an otter sighting too. \nAs much as I didn't expect to see\
  \ a tiger on the very first safari, I also didn't expect some of the things the\
  \ forest guides to do to please the customers. Yes I was lucky and I understand\
  \ that the guides want only the best sighting for their customers but I wish it\
  \ won't come at the expense of nature. When you are face to face with a tiger in\
  \ it's natural habitat we ought to respect it's privacy and make less sound. All\
  \ tourists these days have high tech cameras and they will get the best shot no\
  \ matter what so guides should stop clambering as soon as the tiger is spotted.\n\
  Save Tiger. Save Nature."
