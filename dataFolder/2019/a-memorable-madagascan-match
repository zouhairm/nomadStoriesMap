Text: "We were about to embark on one of the world\u2019s deadliest crossings. A stretch\
  \ of sea known for such treacherous currents that the ferry crossings only take\
  \ place once a day within the calmest hours of the morning. If this didn\u2019t\
  \ act as a warning, the sick bag given to all on board certainly did. We had just\
  \ endured a 300km drive down a cyclone-weathered road and nothing was going to stop\
  \ us from reaching our destination. Although a little windswept, we survived the\
  \ ordeal - it only took three hours longer than anticipated. A recent cyclone had\
  \ washed away the main jetty so the departure consisted of several shuttle runs,\
  \ manoeuvring both people and chickens back and forth. \n\nSainte Marie eventually\
  \ came into view. We were teased with the sighting of a jetty to allow for swift\
  \ passage onto the island, but quickly realised that the process of reuniting the\
  \ passengers with their luggage would provide further complication. After some negotiation,\
  \ we emerged with five bags, unruffled by the loss of one shoe endured in the process.\
  \ We hopped into a couple of tuk tuks and bounced our way to our next sea voyage:\
  \ a set of pirogues to take us over a small channel to our next island. Seeing the\
  \ glistening lagoon and overhanging palms emerge made our long journey a distant\
  \ memory.\n\nCompletely cut off from society, there was little infrastructure in\
  \ place and as a result, the only way of getting around was by pirogue. With no\
  \ WIFI available, this was a place you could properly unwind. Yet the fear of missing\
  \ out was too much and on our arrival to the island, we were sifting through the\
  \ guidebook looking for potential venues to watch the imminent Autumn Internationals\
  \ rugby game between South Africa and England. We eventually came across a South\
  \ African who owned a bar on the other side of the island. We took our chances and\
  \ a local fisherman agreed to take us there in his pirogue. \n\nWe may have been\
  \ back out at sea but the memories of the long journey disappeared as the sun sank\
  \ below the horizon creating a purple haze. Nothing but the lapping of the water\
  \ and the distant cries of lemurs could be heard. It soon became apparent we were\
  \ the only boat on the vast ocean and as the darkness flooded our view, the fluorescent\
  \ blue plankton became our primary light source to navigate our way. Thankfully\
  \ it was in abundance and it illuminated our path as we glided through the shallow\
  \ waters, trying our best to avoid the sharp coral reef below. \n\nWe finally arrived\
  \ at Lucky Dube, a reggae themed pizza bar and, to our delight, the rugby was being\
  \ streamed on a big screen and a dozen pairs of eyes were fixated on the screen.\
  \ We may have missed a good chunk of the first half due to the difficulties we experienced\
  \ at low tide; however, we were pleased to have located a TV. The viewing experience\
  \ was unique, and not just because the bar had been crafted from the belly of an\
  \ old fishing boat. The uproar following each try was matched by an invisible crowd\
  \ of lemurs who became equally animated and electrified the air with their haunting\
  \ melody. Other spectators of the game included a squealing pig on its way to be\
  \ slaughtered and a swarm of fireflies, which lit up the sky. \n\nWhilst our side\
  \ didn\u2019t win, it was definitely a match to remember and an experience we wouldn\u2019\
  t be able to repeat."
