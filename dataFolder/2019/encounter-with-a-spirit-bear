Text: "In September 2018, we were traveling for the first time to the Great Bear Rainforest.\
  \ This unique landscape on the West Coast of Canada is one of the last contiguous\
  \ large cold rain forests of the world. So far, the region is not very strong in\
  \ the tourist focus, but this is what made it particularly attractive for us.\n\n\
  So we made our way and arrived \u2013 very befitting \u2013 in the pouring rain\
  \ at the Spirit Bear Lodge in Klemtu from where we wanted to start our bear excursions.\
  \ Of course we also heard about the Kermode Bears, the \u201ESpirit Bears\u201C\
  , but we initially counted no great chance to obtain having an encounter with these\
  \ rare animals. When we left for the tour the next morning, the sky was gray. Still,\
  \ it was dry and so we drove about an hour with our little boat until we arrived\
  \ at one of the many small islands that make up this region. Salmon jumped all around,\
  \ eagles circled above us, on the horizon we saw humpback whales \u2013 just breathtaking.\
  \ After we had climbed ashore, we immersed into a silence which was not oppressive,\
  \ but made us feel reverently. We felt this place is something special.\n\nNo sooner\
  \ had we reached the place that should be our observation post for the day, we were\
  \ greeted by a huge Black Bear. Just 20 meters in front of us, he calmly ate a salmon.\n\
  \nWe were amazed at how close to us this animal came without being disturbed by\
  \ us. But then we held our breath \u2013 from the forest came a Spirit Bear!\nHe\
  \ was not as massive as his black conspecific and his white fur shone downright\
  \ against the dark trees. Despite its color, he had no resemblance to a Polar Bear.\
  \ When he noticed us, he was attentive. He wasn\u2019t afraid of us. Slowly he moved\
  \ up to us \u2013 at first very hesitant, then more and more resolutely. Again and\
  \ again he stopped to look out for us, even stood on his hind legs to have a better\
  \ view on us. He was beautiful, and nothing threatening came out of him.\n\nMotionless\
  \ we sat there and watched spellbound as he came closer. Soon I had put the camera\
  \ aside because I was too fascinated by this beautiful animal. Finally he had approached\
  \ almost five meters towards me. Then he paused and looked me calmly straight in\
  \ the eye.\n\nI will never forget this feeling for all my life. A moment so intense\
  \ and peaceful as I would never have dreamed of! When he watched me well enough,\
  \ he turned away and walked slowly down to the river to fish. My heart was racing.\
  \ I was indescribably happy. We watched as he skillfully catched salmon from the\
  \ raging water and then disappeared into the forest with his prey again.\n\nOn this\
  \ day he came back several times, and when we left his territory it was almost as\
  \ if we would say good bye to an old friend.\n\nWe know that we will come back to\
  \ the mysterious, magnificent forest of the Spirit Bears, because a part of us stayed\
  \ there."
