Text: "That Thursday morning streamed in with the desert looking physiologically alien\
  \ and esthetically abstract, unlike anything I had seen while riding to the west.\
  \ My eyes were beset by the novelty of light, overwhelming space, and battering\
  \ wind. He stood up and stretched out his hand and a moment later, I pulled over.\
  \ After the second try, he was able to lift his leg around and sit on the bike.\
  \ I had already dropped off a man to work and two kids to their field by then on\
  \ that morning. I asked where he wanted to go as I introduced myself.\n\nHis designated\
  \ stop would not come for the next few minutes so we rode under the sun that was\
  \ getting more violent by the minute. He would walk down another empty road so I\
  \ decided to take him as far as we could ride. It took us hardly six more minutes;\
  \ it would have taken at least 30 more on foot. My hopes quickly vanished when the\
  \ road came to a dead end in the middle of the desert and gave birth to a sandy\
  \ trail.\n\nHe said he'd walk about 12 km from here. It slowly dawned on me that\
  \ he said he'd cross this land on foot. The desert landforms, seemingly stretching\
  \ for infinity, impart a beauty that is atemporal; but it's not the case if you\
  \ walk through the land, as dry as a bone, every day. The afternoon clouds in an\
  \ unobstructed sky were massive, majestic and I thought it may bring him a temporary\
  \ relief. I asked if he was carrying any provisions and water. He took out a pack\
  \ of biscuits and gave it to me; he might have sensed that I'm hungry. I refused\
  \ with a smile and handed him some food from my stock. \n\nAnd on he went, not a\
  \ pilgrim or an exile, just another level-headed man, not to escape anything but\
  \ to live in his reality. I stood in the grandeur of these western wilds for another\
  \ five minutes, wiping my sun-bleached face and watching his footsteps that were\
  \ gradually being reclaimed by the vermilion sands of the desert. Premaram was simply\
  \ gone and I'll never know what became of him. \n\nBetween a few calls of eagles\
  \ encircling above and the comical scurrying of lizards, I thought: how can this\
  \ be therapeutic? It only amplified my sweet ache of longing and belonging. This\
  \ would not be the end of the story, I will hit the road again to find the true\
  \ interests of man and reverence for life."
