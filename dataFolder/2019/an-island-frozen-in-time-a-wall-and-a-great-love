Text: "When I first set foot in Cyprus, it started as a big leap into the unknown:\
  \ all I had in my hands was a backpack and a piece of paper - my brand new degree.\
  \ I did not know much back then but that I was ready to jump blindfolded into this\
  \ flowing river life is, towards far lands. Two years later, let me tell you the\
  \ tale of an island frozen in time, a wall, and a great love.\n\nSince the first\
  \ day I walked around the streets of Nicosia my heart broke a little. And every\
  \ day my heart breaks a little bit more. I see people queuing to cross the Green\
  \ Line , some with curious eyes, others with an annoyed expression. Clearly the\
  \ island instils curiosity to the visitors, a bittersweet feeling to the inhabitants.\
  \ Sometimes, I sit in that cosy caf\xE9 flanked by the border checkpoint in Ledra\
  \ Street while hearing stories from the past; but my eyes can\u2019t stop staring\
  \ at the barbed wire fence and at the buildings in ruins, left at the mercy of time.\
  \ I have been walking fascinated through the narrow streets, between the shisha\
  \ scent and the sound of laoutos, with one foot in Tahtakala and the other one in\
  \ Faneromenis. Always divided in between. What would normally be an ordinary activity,\
  \ such as drinking a cup of tea with some friends in the city centre, in Cyprus\
  \ takes on a new meaning.\n\nCyprus is an island of contradictions and mixed feelings,\
  \ in everything you do it is possible to perceive those different flavours belonging\
  \ to two great cultures, adorned by several others. It is all part of the charm.\
  \ But yes, it is a contradiction when cultural differences, supposed to enrich us,\
  \ bring division instead. I see charm, and I see a fracture. And my heart breaks\
  \ because partitions do not affect only a country, but people as well. This is why\
  \ sometimes I spend my nights in rooftops waiting for the muezzin to fascinatingly\
  \ chant when the time for the Fajr  comes. This is why sometimes I enjoy going up\
  \ to Troodos mountains and let old giagias  tell me of happier times while they\
  \ remember playing under the olive trees. Some days, if I am lucky enough, I can\
  \ see Turkish and Greek Cypriots meeting each other for the first time, looking\
  \ at their brotherly \u201Cother\u201D with the surprised eyes of a child, and realising\
  \ that nobody is so different after all. I am particularly joyful when the encounter\
  \ ends in celebration and toasts. But one cannot expect that happening so often.\
  \ Not yet. \n\nDo you know what is fascinating about leaping into the unknown? That\
  \ at first it can seem a jump into the abysses, but make no mistake: there could\
  \ not be bravest and life-rewarding decision as that of discovering a whole new\
  \ world that will gift you the feeling of being at home, where you can re-discover\
  \ yourself, evolve, and leave your mark. \n\nBut suddenly I wake up to the sound\
  \ of air raid sirens and the world is still divided: Cyprus, you are so beautiful\
  \ to me and still, so melancholic some days."
