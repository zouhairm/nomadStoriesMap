Text: "Everytime I feel I am vacay deprived, I venture out for some or other kind\
  \ of thrill. It can be either a mountainous region or to the beaches!\nRecently\
  \ I had been to one of the most happening places of Himachal Pradesh in India :\
  \ Kasol. This place feels like heaven on earth with lush green forests, crystal\
  \ clear blue water streams, snow-clad peaks and sheer blue sky!\n\nKasol is a party\
  \ destination of the Israelis. If you want to spot them in huge numbers, you must\
  \ visit Kasol in the summer months of May and June. Usually one can find three types\
  \ of people here : the Spiritual, the Adventurous, the Partyholics. There are many\
  \ ancient temples in and around the town. If you are interested in some adventure\
  \ therapy, you must head to the Kheerganga trek. If you are a party person, you\
  \ can enjoy and sway to the music played in any of the clubs in the town. If you\
  \ just want to relax and soak into the culture, you could just book a room in one\
  \ of the hotels in Kasol (make sure to book well in advance) and enjoy the scenic\
  \ views from your balcony. You may find good souvenirs for yourself and your friends/family\
  \ in the Kasol market. Make sure you don't forget to buy the flag which has a religious\
  \ \"mantra\" printed on it.\n\nWhen I went there, we booked a tent overlooking the\
  \ Parvati River and the Mountains. It was a marvel to my eyes! The sound of the\
  \ flowing water, birds chirping and the music of the nature soothed my ears! It\
  \ was a picture perfect place. You could click and click and click pictures and\
  \ never stop. The best part about Kasol were the Dogs! Apart from being cute and\
  \ sweet, they were full of fur and healthy as compared to Mumbai dogs( which seem\
  \ to be suffering from malnutrition\U0001F602). The dogs would literally accompany\
  \ me wherever I go, firstly because they loved me\U0001F648 and secondly because\
  \ I gave them biscuits and wafers to eat\U0001F605. They even came to bid us adieu\
  \ at the bus stop when we were leaving for a new adventure to a new place.\n\nKasol\
  \ has been the best place until now that I have visited. I made friends for lifetime.\
  \ Each and every element of the trip is imbibed in me. It was really difficult for\
  \ me to leave the place behind and go. The fun and enjoyment I had here with my\
  \ newly made friends is something I can never have in my very own city, Those are\
  \ the moments I wish I could live them one more time in my life. I wish I stayed\
  \ there for one more day, I wish I visit Kasol one more time! For as travelling\
  \ is fuel to my hungry soul."
