Text: "Bogota.\nMore than 3 thoudand meters above the sea level.\nMore than 45 mln\
  \ of peple.\nIn the airport you will meet the reality of life here - policemen with\
  \ dogs check all luggage. It is not fun, it seems dangerous. You don't know what\
  \ to expect. You are trembling inside. I felt my fingers got wet, when the policemen\
  \ came to me. Done...I passed! I am here. I came to Bogota after 14 hour amazing\
  \ flight with Tukish airline. One of the longest flights in my life. \n\nBogota\
  \ is a special city fo me. I think all girls like bad boys, maybe that is why I\
  \ left my heart there. All cities are like people. You build relations with all\
  \ of them. \n\nI really did not know what to expect. I came first time to Latin\
  \ America with my boyfriend and he scared me during one year that Bogota is horrible,\
  \ cold (btw I am from Russia), dirty and smelly places. I checked all blogs, Tv-shows\
  \ shows about Bogota. 90% of people advised to skip this place. I was ready to see\
  \ all these problems, at the same time I told myself to open my eyes and stop judge\
  \ the city before I can breath it, taste it and smell it.\n\nMy tip was last summer,\
  \ but I still remember these amazng small cafes (Juan Valdez I miss especially),\
  \ strong coffee after which I had a headache, taste of mango and juice from pineaplle\
  \ slices on my face. \n\nUnfortunately, the history of Colombia from 90-s still\
  \ has a great influence. It creates a bad image, but time changes. Yes, of course\
  \ there are homeless people. Yes. Of course there are criminals. But tell me, where\
  \ we don't have problems? \n\nI didn't expect to find here normal life. I found.\
  \ On weekend the city conveted into small Amsterdam. Most of the roads are closed\
  \ for cars and everyone is going to ride a bicycle. There are a lot of families,\
  \ with children. \n\nI didn't expect to find interesting institute, universities\
  \ and schools with huge territories and nice campuses.\n\nI didn't expect to see\
  \ a lot of beautiful parks and beautiful libraries, where you can come to work and\
  \ have free computers and wifi. \n\nI didn't expect to find rich districts there\
  \ with streets, houses and shops like in Dubai! Where people walk with phones in\
  \ their hands and noone is afaid to be killed for it. \n\nI didn't expect to taste\
  \ so many nice things - from local coffee (at least 6 different types) to sweets\
  \ and crazy dishes (fried ants). \n\nI didn't expect to dance at crazy parties (Andres\
  \ Carne restaurant) with friends! \n\nThis trip opened my eyes on many things. Neve\
  \ judge the place based on someone's opinion. You will lose. Never reject to try\
  \ new experience, to speak with new people, to be more open-minded. \n\nI definetely\
  \ want to come back and continue my exploration of this place. I fall in love already,\
  \ and I hope it is mutually."
