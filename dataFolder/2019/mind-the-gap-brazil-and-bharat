Text: "The clouds took up their position even before Air India 144 started its 14-hours-long,\
  \ uninterrupted journey from Newark to what was first called by wayward Portuguese\
  \ explorer Gaspar Correira \u201Cuma boa ba\xEDa\u201D and now is simultaneously\
  \ called Bombay, or officially Mumbai. Whether you first saw it from the scurrying\
  \ eye of enterprising merchants of a not-so-distant colonial past, or heard it on\
  \ the lips of Hindu nationalists ready to take their patrimony back to the extent\
  \ of linguistic reconquest, the City of Dreams is impossible to mistake with any\
  \ other bustling metropolis on Earth\u2014 that is, if any rival can compete with\
  \ the shining aspirations of its twenty million souls. \n\nAgain, the clouds can\
  \ attest: without exaggeration \u2014 and nor would I want to \u2014 there was not\
  \ one truly sunny day while I resided in the city. Perhaps the top-secret experiments\
  \ of IIT Bombay in climate control took a step forward on July 13th when, from the\
  \ top-floor window of X Billion Lab\u2019s office in the always apocalyptically-chic\
  \ Bandra neighborhood, I saw a miraculous sight: blue skies during the monsoon season.\
  \ Don\u2019t get me wrong, though; the clouds, or as they would rather be christened\
  \ by the ever-popular #mumbairains, express a singular personality. Trembling, unfurling,\
  \ and speeding their course with due dynamism, I was never left unimpressed after\
  \ a regular commute via Uber across the Sea Link, gleaming symbol of an India veering\
  \ its seemingly endless momentum towards the promises of the third millennium. \n\
  \nHow then can it be that Mumbai, a skipping-stone scattering of islands engineering\
  \ by sheer human will into a fertile field of skyscrapers more closely packed than\
  \ shafts of bamboo, be \u201Capocalyptically chic?\u201D It\u2019s a question that\
  \ carries no critique in its wake, but rather the thick, salty air, of everything\
  \ that can be and \u2014 as has been proven by the endurance of the subcontinent\u2019\
  s spirit from the time of Alexander to Mughal, then British conquest and final liberation\
  \ \u2014 will be. \n\nEverything blends in that shared air, for better or worse:\
  \ the blissfully pungent scent of pav bhaji dancing its way to the stage of your\
  \ senses, eyes tearing from smoke and ears picking up on the reassuring call of\
  \ the vendor that today his stall is a lassiwala too, oven-fired clay cups and all\
  \ filled with yogurt-y goodness for only 30 rupees. It is overwhelming, from first\
  \ exposure getting off the airplane unto the last, of which there is none, since\
  \ India finds a way to make itself known in even the smallest nooks flung across\
  \ the four corners of the globe (gulab jamun with vanilla macarons, anyone?) As\
  \ for the less-welcomed scents, I believe that should be left to the boundless contortions\
  \ of the imagination\u2026 and a glance at recent reports on the city\u2019s failure\
  \ to implement a comprehensive sewage system.\n\nWhile typing up this up from the\
  \ comfort of my aunt's home in Rio de Janeiro, Bharat and Brazil mesh in the mind\u2019\
  s eye to be one in the same, and I am still not convinced that if I were to raft\
  \ down the tawny waters of the Amazon I wouldn\u2019t eventually find the marble\
  \ piers of Varanasi after a 80-day feat. If the average medieval monk-turned-geographer\
  \ is to be trusted, there exists in fact not one, but three Indias, encompassing\
  \ what is now locales rarely thought to be related as Vietnam and Ethiopia. Throwing\
  \ the misidentification of the East and West \u201CIndies\u201D in the mix of cartographical\
  \ blunders, it soon becomes clear that this classification of everything \u201C\
  Other\u201D to the glories of Europe as India reflects a deliberate process of exclusion\
  \ whose repercussions can still be felt today. \n\nNevertheless, as the contours\
  \ of an impoverished Global South came into shape in modernity\u2019s dust, India\
  \ proper found like company not to commiserate with, but to grow in interdependence\
  \ for the sake of a common future. Whether that be a jugaad-tinged mindset or a\
  \ gambiarra patching a bridge along the way, I believe that the various Indias of\
  \ the globe gain strength in banding together to part the mists of a monsoon afternoon\
  \ just long enough to watch the sun set over the crest of mountains lining Guanabara\
  \ Bay, Baga Beach, and everywhere in between."
