Text: "I never thought it would happen to me. \n\nWaking up on a beach in Thailand\
  \ isn't always a dream come true. Groggy, I raised my head from the sand and looked\
  \ side to side. I didn't see anybody. I tried in vain to remember the previous night.\
  \ \"Wow\" I thought, slowly sitting up, and noticing my lack of clothes. \"It must\
  \ have been a mad one.\" Lethargically, I rolled over and got up, stumbling to the\
  \ road, hoping for any sign of something familiar. My surroundings were pretty deserted.\
  \ I reasoned that it must have been the fringes of the city. The quintessentially\
  \ jagged rock formations towered above the jungle all around me. With my back to\
  \ the sea I marched inland, towards civilization, in search of my hostel. \"Ouch\"\
  . A searing pain shot through my calf. I stopped to examine it. A circular yellow,\
  \ burn, roughly the size of a coaster, oozed and crackled, announcing it's presence\
  \ on my lower leg. \"Where in the world did that come from?\" I wondered, starting\
  \ to worry a little. I quickly pushed the pangs of anxiety to the back of my mind.\
  \ \"You just drank too much and got lost, that's all\". I checked the pockets of\
  \ my swimming togs. I had lost the wallet my parents gave me the day I turned 21.\
  \ I looked at my wrist. My watch was gone, replaced by a tan line that reminded\
  \ me just how far from home I really was. I decided to mourne my possessions later.\
  \ I soldiered on. The further inland I got, the more the dwellings around me seemed\
  \ to band together in an attempt to resemble a city. Something felt off. Very off.\
  \ \n\nThe first taxi driver I attempted to hail pretended not to see me, and no\
  \ wonder. I wouldn't stop for a disoriented guy in his swimming togs at dawn either.\
  \ The second taxi also sped past, 15 minutes later. This was the trend for the next\
  \ hour, until a motorbike pulled up. The driver gestured to the back of his vehicle\
  \ with a leatherclad thumb, without lowering his helmet's visor. I didn't see much\
  \ of a choice. Beggars can't be choosers, and my sunburn was painfully exposed.\
  \ I got on. \n\"500 Baht\" he shouted over the noise of the engine. I happily agreed.\
  \ \n\"Pay when arrive\" I said, and he nodded. I told him the name of my hostel\
  \ and he kicked off, handing me his helmet. Everybody stopped to look as we weaved\
  \ through rush hour traffic. Everybody. There were no tourists here, and I was perched\
  \ on the back of a small motorbike, white as the beaches, wearing nothing but swimming\
  \ togs and a black helmet. We eventually arrived at the hostel. The wrong hostel.\n\
  \"Wrong hostel\" I said, shaking my head. He jabbed a finger towards the building.\
  \ \n\"Only hostel\" he said. I sighed, asked him to wait, and went in. The receptionist\
  \ glanced at my attire with relative disinterest. I told her the name of my hostel,\
  \ and asked for directions. She laughed. \n\"That's in Krabi\" she said, nonchalantly.\
  \ My puzzled reaction seemed to get her attention. \n\"Where's Krabi?\" I enquired,\
  \ confused. \"Are we not in Krabi? \n\"No\", she mouthed, shaking her head. I had\
  \ heard enough. I returned to the motorcyclist. \n\"Krabi\" I said. \"1000 Baht\"\
  . \nHe responded something indiscernable and we set off again. After a while, we\
  \ reached the outskirts of whatever we were, and hit open road. Our trail whipped\
  \ through jungles and coasted over flat wetlands. I didn't do much thinking on the\
  \ back of that bike, I just watched the world go by. Over an hour passed before\
  \ we reached Krabi, the homeland of my last intact memory from only 12 hours previously.\
  \ That hostel shone like an oasis in the desert. The motorcyclist parked firmly\
  \ outside the front door to wait for his money. I scrambled up 4 flights of stairs,\
  \ and burst into the bedroom. Everybody looked up. \n\"I need 1500 Baht\" \n\"Where\
  \ the hell did you go last night?\" Niall asked, opening his wallet reluctantly.\n\
  \"I don't know\", I admitted. \n\"That wasn't like you at all\" he said. \"You only\
  \ had one beer.\""
