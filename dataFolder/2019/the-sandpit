Text: "How did I get here? Or maybe the question is why am I here? A career that I\
  \ love, a family that means the world to me, stuck between a duty to stay on one\
  \ path and a passion and need to break away and be the person I need to be. \nMaybe\
  \ that is how I chose to go, or why the desert chose me. I've heard it said that\
  \ too many people are born, grow up, live and die within the same box. My box has\
  \ always been missing a piece, one needed to contain and confine. \nI dry the tears\
  \ and scrub my face. A face that has eyes that haven't slept in nearly 32 hours.\
  \ I pull my hair back and wrap a long black scarf around my head. Deep breath. I\
  \ slip on the black gown, my abaya, that will be my cover for the next year. Covered\
  \ head to toe, hands to ankles I examine myself in the bathroom mirror at the airport.\
  \ I think I am ready. Ready for what, that is my question. \nI have always been\
  \ fascinated by the unknown, the unreachable. Wanting so badly to see and touch\
  \ and smell for myself, to push past those who have come before me. Part of my being\
  \ feels pulled towards home and the rest is rushing forward, willing my whole self\
  \ to be present.\nI take hold of my bags and walk through customs. I look around\
  \ me and fall into step among the other women clothed in long, black, very forgiving\
  \ gowns. A sea of obscured figures melting into one live creature heading out into\
  \ the world. I join them.\nI leave the safety and familiarity of the airport. With\
  \ one last pause I turn, another breath, this one full of hot, dry air. My lungs\
  \ taking in this new air. I step into the car that has arrived to shuttle me to\
  \ my new home, the place that I will call home for the next year. Will this be as\
  \ temporary as I had planned or could this be the start of something completely\
  \ different. My head is spinning. Excitement, sleep deprivation, confusion, a language\
  \ I cannot understand, new sights. Everything feels so fast that I don't have time\
  \ to take it all in. We drive.\nI arrive at my destination. A little apartment across\
  \ the roadway from where I will be working. The call to prayer brings the evening\
  \ air to life and I listen. I have only enough energy to shower off the day of travel.\
  \ I let the dirt and homesickness be washed away. I sit at my desk and pull out\
  \ my journal, a book that used to be just a book but now contains written emotion,\
  \ feeling, fear, worry, promise, excitement. I look back over my last entry, scribbled\
  \ in rushed handwriting about my feeling during my last night at home. What I think\
  \ I will miss and what I hope for this next chapter in my life. \nI turn to a new\
  \ page, again my head spins. Thoughts rush in and out but all I can do is stare\
  \ at the blank page. This really is it, a black slate. A new start, a promise of\
  \ something. I am going to fill these pages with amazing stories, but tonight, at\
  \ this moment I need sleep.\nI close the book, leaving my pen inside to mark the\
  \ spot. I climb into bed and pull the blankets up under my chin. My eyelids are\
  \ heavy with sleep, my body limp and tire, but my mind still goes on and on. \n\
  What will tomorrow bring? What does this place look like and feel like when the\
  \ sun shines on the shadows that I passed through. One last breath and I fall into\
  \ a deep and dreamless sleep. My body lies in wait for what will come next, my leap\
  \ into the unknown."
