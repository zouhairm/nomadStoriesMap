Text: "I\u2019m not sure when or how it started, but a few years ago I developed a\
  \ fear of flying. \n\nMy plane-based panic began to grow at about the same time\
  \ that all the crazy airline travel policies developed, so often when I would say,\
  \ \u201CI hate to fly!\u201D people would think I hated navigating security checkpoints,\
  \ wiggling into tiny airline seats, and having to pay an extra fee just because\
  \ I wanted to bring more than a Kleenex with me on a cross-country trip. \n\nWhen\
  \ I would explain that I didn\u2019t mind taking off my shoes, and my belt, and\
  \ my coat, and emptying my pockets, and storing shampoo in a sandwich bag, they\
  \ would look at me with confusion and ask me what it was that I hated. \n\nMy answer:\
  \ I hate the possibility that this two-ton tin bird will stop soaring and I will\
  \ die. \n\nThen the person I am talking to will usually \u201Ctsk, tsk\u201D and\
  \ make one or more of the following comments:\n\n(a)    Flying is much safer than\
  \ traveling by car. \n(b)    Millions of planes land safely each year. \n(c)   \
  \ Don\u2019t be such a pussy. \n\nThe problem with all of these replies is that\
  \ they are rational responses to an irrational fear.  So, they don\u2019t work.\
  \  At all. \n\nI think my fear of flying was an early manifestation of a mid-life\
  \ crisis.  I have so many things that I still want to accomplish and I\u2019m so\
  \ fearful that I will simply run out of time or be impeded by an unexpected event\
  \ \u2013 like a plane crash \u2013 and never reach all my goals and dreams. So,\
  \ in a totally contrary way, my fear of flying \u2013 this fear of leaving the ground\
  \ \u2013 is actually a fear that I will never fly as high as I want to. \n\nBut,\
  \ this past Monday I had to suck it up, suck down a Xanax, and board a plane to\
  \ New York City for a much needed Broadway vacation with a friend.  It\u2019s only\
  \ a two hour flight from Atlanta to NYC but I was white-knuckling it the entire\
  \ time. \n\nWhile checking into the hotel, the concierge asked how the flight was\
  \ and I told him how I hated to fly.  He responded, \u201CI hate it too. But I always\
  \ think about the pilot and how he doesn\u2019t want to crash either.\u201D \n\n\
  And there it was\u2026 the correct answer. \n\nI always focus on the plane and how\
  \ the ability for all these people to fly together through the air doesn\u2019t\
  \ really make sense to me and how cold and impersonal and HEAVY the plane is. \n\
  \nAnd I totally forgot that up in the cockpit were people.  People with families,\
  \ and goals, and dreams of their own.  And they don\u2019t want to crash.  And they\
  \ will do everything they can to keep us in the air. \n\nAnd this gentle reminder\
  \ about humanity, offered in an offhanded way, suddenly set me free."
