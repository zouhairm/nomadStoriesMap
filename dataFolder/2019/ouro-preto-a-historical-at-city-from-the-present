Text: "When I first been in Ouro Preto, a small city in Minas Gerais, I was 12 years\
  \ old and literally no experience of life. I was in a school trip with my friends\
  \ so, obviously, I wasn\u2019t interested in the history of the place or in the\
  \ goods that it could give to me. However it was a great trip and it had aroused\
  \ a good feeling in me. \nYears later, when I already was 17 years old, I went to\
  \ Ouro Preto again. This time with much more living in my back and with thirst for\
  \ experience. I stayed in a Frat-house, very common in this college city, called\
  \ OxiG\xEAnios. That fact was what made my trip so good, the boys that lived there\
  \ were very nice and introduced me into the college\u2019s parties at this very\
  \ popular Brazilian way. One night, seven parties, that\u2019s the kind of vibe\
  \ that you will find in Ouro Preto at school time. \nBut, of course, no travel women\
  \ lives of just party. At a very busy weekend, Sunday was the day of touring. We,\
  \ me and my cousin, walked into the hills of Ouro Preto, like we were in a 1880\u2019\
  s movies, due to the historical role of the called golden city. We heard lots of\
  \ myths and legends, like the one of the boy in the picture. At the Frat-house Maracangalha,\
  \ lives an old picture of a young boy, dated of the 1900\u2019s. The legend says\
  \ that, at the time, Ouro Preto was the scenario of a massive tuberculosis\u2019\
  \ epidemic, putting all the city in quarantine. A doctor\u2019s time came and found\
  \ a way to keep the families fed, they put the plate with food under the door, waited\
  \ for the patient to eat and return the plate empty. At the house that today is\
  \ Maracangalha, lived a family, the mother, the father and their little son, all\
  \ them sick. One day, the mother and father\u2019s plates stopped coming back; the\
  \ doctors concluded that they were already dead. After some time, the boy\u2019\
  s plate stopped coming back but when the doctor\u2019s time came for his body they\
  \ didn\u2019t find it, the house was emptied and just a little picture was left,\
  \ a picture of the boy, a young and blond little man. When the boys came to the\
  \ house to build their Fraternity, the picture still was there and could not be\
  \ token of. Since then, the house is marked with stories that could make you believe\
  \ that Ouro Preto was forgotten in time and is the house of lots of ghosts. One\
  \ time a tourist was in Maracangalha as a guest, he had a lot to drink (totally\
  \ common in Ouro Preto) and fell asleep at their couch, at dawn he was feeling cold\
  \ (also very common in Ouro Preto, famous for its lows temperatures) but had no\
  \ conditions to get up and find something to warm him. At some point, he opens his\
  \ eyes and see a little boy, golden hair and green eyes, covering him with some\
  \ blanket, the sleepiness of the tourist prohibited him from thanking the boy, but,\
  \ at morning, as he was telling all the boys about the gentle boy, he saw the picture\
  \ of a child from the 1900\u2019s and pointed the boy as the gentleman from the\
  \ other night. When explained about the legend, the tourist, terrified, took his\
  \ stuff and ran. This kind of story is so common in Ouro Preto that you just can\u2019\
  t believe it. Even tough I never witness one, I truly believe in the good in all\
  \ Ouro Preto\u2019s ghosts.\nBeyond the amazing legends, Ouro Preto has so much\
  \ culinary (Brazilian, French, Italian etc) and catholic curches to be explore that,\
  \ honestly, one weekend is not enough.\nWhen I heard this stories from so many residents\
  \ of Ouro Preto, I could imagine that one day I would became one and now I can explore\
  \ daily the beautys of this awesome city."
