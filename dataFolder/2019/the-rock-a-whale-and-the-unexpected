Text: "Traveling to Grates Cove in Newfoundland, Canada, the famous nickname for the\
  \ island, \u201CThe Rock\u201D takes on a whole new meaning.  In the secluded fishing\
  \ town full of dilapidated old fisherman shacks and gravely roads, there\u2019s\
  \ a historical treasure hidden amongst the grassy hills.\n\nWhen my family first\
  \ arrived to Grate\u2019s Cove, we weren\u2019t sure what to expect.  Though my\
  \ father\u2019s family is from Newfoundland and still lives on The Rock, none had\
  \ been to this gem of a cove.  We were drawn there by the mysterious stone walls\
  \ that were said to surround the town, most over 300 years old and crumbling around\
  \ the edges, but still breathtaking.  \n\nWhen we arrived in Grate\u2019s Cove,\
  \ our first stop was at a small inn, restaurant, and art studio - pretty much the\
  \ only place to have a meal in the quaint, and tiny, town.  The Grate\u2019s Cove\
  \ Studio in an unexpected and marvelous eatery, full of interesting artwork, entertaining\
  \ stories, and delectable food.  We learned, after my father and grandfather jabbered\
  \ on with the owners, that the studio was started by a native Newfoundlander and\
  \ his wife, an American from Louisiana.  The pair ended up creating the menu from\
  \ scratch, full of buttery fresh cod, which is in plentiful supply in the region,\
  \ crab, and assorted seafood and inspired by both Cajun and Korean cuisine.  It\
  \ was quite the intresting pairing, sushi topped with scruncheons, part of a local\
  \ favorite Fish and Brewis, and Korean veggie pancake with a cajun seasoned seafood\
  \ boil.\n\nAfter filling our bellies to the brim and feeling stogged, as Newfoundlanders\
  \ would say, we were given directions to the beginning of the trail that would lead\
  \ use among the centuries old stone walls.  The trail was unassuming - a small dirt\
  \ lot with room for no more than 4 vehicles and a handpainted sign marking where\
  \ to begin - but the views, the walls, and the salty ocean wind was breathtaking.\
  \  The hike took us in amongst the walls, some standing tall, others toppled and\
  \ covered in lichen, and always weaving in and out of magnificient vistas overlooking\
  \ the Atlantic.\n\nAfter making our way partly through, each of us holding onto\
  \ our coats and hats to ward off the chilly wind (it turns out it was the coldest\
  \ June in Newfoundland on record for decades), my cousin made an exciting discovery\
  \ while we were paused overlooking the ocean.  After alerting us all to the site,\
  \ we scanned the tumultuous deep blue water for another peek and were at last rewarded\
  \ - a whale off in the distance, the loud spout it released standing out against\
  \ the vast blueness of the ocean.\n\nLike our siting of the whale, our time in Grate\u2019\
  s Cove was fleeting, but it was unforgettable.  I know I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ such a warm welcome, such history, and such miraculous marine life when we started\
  \ on our drive to the small coastal town, and it was a surprise to see how much\
  \ the native Newfoundlanders in our midst appreciated the trip as well.  It was\
  \ certainly an experience I\u2019ll not soon forget."
