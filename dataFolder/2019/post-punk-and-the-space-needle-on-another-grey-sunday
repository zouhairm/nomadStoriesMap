Text: "I was indecisive about going to Seattle at all until about an hour and half\
  \ before the train left from Vancouver. When I finally made up my mind, my cousin\
  \ rushed me to the nearest London Drugs, I bought a Visa gift card with 400 Canadian\
  \ dollars on it, rushed back to the Pacific Central Station, filled my declaration\
  \ forms and managed to get on the train with about ten minutes to spare. \nI was\
  \ told the Amtrak Cascades trip down to Seattle was spectacular, but sadly by the\
  \ time the train left the station it was dark out; I wouldn\u2019t get to see the\
  \ tranquil coastal sceneries and open fields until the trip back. What I did glimpse\
  \ at in the darkness were houses on hillsides and rusty railroad stations, a small\
  \ whiff of the urban monstrosity I was approaching. \nMy goal was to see Preoccupations\
  \ and Protomartyr, two of the great modern bastions of post-punk music, but the\
  \ concert wasn\u2019t until the following night. I had all of Sunday to explore\
  \ Seattle, with no real clue of where I was going to go and how I was going to get\
  \ there. \nFive and a half hours later I was at the Green Tortoise Hostel. I took\
  \ to socializing with the staff and other Canadians at the hostel\u2019s smoking\
  \ room and realized that drifting through the city the next day would be fine as\
  \ long as I got to see the fabled Space Needle. It turned out the venue the concert\
  \ was going to be at, The Crocodile, was somewhere in between the Hostel and the\
  \ Needle. So far so good. \nThe next morning I took to the streets. The obvious\
  \ first destination was Pike Place Market, which could be seen clearly from the\
  \ hostel\u2019s third story windows. Past the roofs and kiosks was the sea. I wandered\
  \ through the crowd and glanced at the wide array of dairy products and sea foods\
  \ on display, but by far my favorite sight there was a busker in a rubber cat mask\
  \ playing the accordion. The cat was settled in the middle of the bustle and gave\
  \ a twist of zaniness to the mornings of thousands of busy travellers walking in\
  \ and out of the Market. The buskers made the city smile in spite of the weather.\
  \ \nWhen I got tired of the crowd I headed inland in search of The Space Needle.\
  \ A light drizzle washed over me as I stared up at the brick buildings and skyscrapers\
  \ of Seattle. They hinted at the struggle of the streets and a corporate world that\
  \ we tourists could only glimpse at in passing. Some twenty minutes later I saw\
  \ it, that great metallic structure puncturing the grey skies above us, and with\
  \ it came the vibrant sounds of traditional Japanese music. When I came closer,\
  \ I saw that the music was being played by a humble old man on what I assume was\
  \ an amplified shamisen. The colossal Space Needle watched over us both, resolutely\
  \ still under the rain. \nThe rest of the day fell away in a daze of wandering.\
  \ Twirling sculptures of glass and color enchanted me as I made my way through Chihuly's\
  \ Garden and Glass. I walked up and down the harbour, talking to strangers and gawking\
  \ at rusting remnants of the American dream. I used the Seattle Great Wheel as a\
  \ permanent point of reference. Come dusk I went to the top of The Space Needle.\
  \ The view was breathtaking at night: the city's skyscrapers jutted out of the concrete\
  \ and into the dark night sky in a flurry of white lights. \nWhen I finally reached\
  \ The Crocodile a little while later, I was exhausted. I knew I had only scratched\
  \ the surface of Seattle and its history of crime and tragedy. I knew I had missed\
  \ the underground tunnels, The Museum of Pop Culture and Jimi Hendrix\u2019s grave.\
  \ I knew that even those sights were still only the surface. But as melancholic\
  \ dirges like \"Memory\" by Preoccupations and \"My Children\" by Protomartyr crushed\
  \ and exhilarated me, I could at least feel the satisfaction of having been there\
  \ to taste it, and I knew I'd be back."
