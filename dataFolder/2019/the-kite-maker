Text: "The sound of a roaring motor made me look outside. My Grab (the Asian version\
  \ of Uber) had arrived. I felt a bit emotional saying good-bye to Anuar, a man I\
  \ only met two hours ago, on a rainy November day in Kota Bharu. \n\n  If you google\
  \ \u201Ctop places to visit in Malaysia\u201D, chances are you will not find Kota\
  \ Bharu and its conservative state, Kelantan, listed anywhere. Kota Bharu is merely\
  \ a drop off point for tourists who seek to reach the beautiful Perhantian Islands,\
  \ a dream spot for diving and snorkelling. I planned to do the same but betting\
  \ against weather forecasts in the mousson season is a risky endeavour. By the time\
  \ I reached Kota Bharu, heavy rains forced the islands hotels to close and cancel\
  \ all sea excursions. So there I was, stuck in Kelantan for four days. \n\n  Surprisingly,\
  \ Kota Bharu had more to offer than the few lazy reviews I read account for. A deeper\
  \ online research introduced me to Mister Sapie, a Kelantanese kite maker who is\
  \ considered a local legend, being one of the last craftsman indulging in the forgotten\
  \ art of Wau (kite in Malay). I got curious so I decided to pay a visit to his gallery,\
  \ a small sheet metal workshop located in the outskirts of the city. The place looked\
  \ exactly like the pictures I had found online; a bright red sheet metal facade,\
  \ with a large sign sitting on top of doorless entry, which reads \"Gallery Wau\"\
  . On the other hand, I was welcomed by a man who looked much younger than I expected.\
  \ That was not Mr. Sapie. That was his son, Anuar. Mr. Sapie was no longer. He left\
  \ this world a few months back, leaving Anuar as the new kite master in Kota Bharu.\n\
  \  \n  The dying art of kite, or Wau, was initiated by wood carvers who used paper\
  \ as a new medium to ripple their blades on. The same ancestral techniques they\
  \ started with have been used generations after generations, up until now. The starting\
  \ point of the kite is obviously its frame, made of bamboo sticks thinned out and\
  \ tied together with strings. Then, with small knifes ranging from different sizes\
  \ and shapes, floral and undulating designs are cut on coloured papers which are\
  \ layered on top of one another. At the end of the process, an intricate pattern\
  \ emerges; the heart and soul of the kite. The paper decorations are finally assembled\
  \ with the frame to form a unique Wau. This whole process can take up to 3 months\
  \ for a 2 meters kite.\n\n  Just like any craft, making kites requires a combination\
  \ of passion and patience. For the passed 20 years, not a single day passed where\
  \ Anuar did go through this complex process. I spend a couple of hours with him,\
  \ like I would have with an old friend with whom social barriers do not exist. As\
  \ he was thinning out a bamboo stick, he was telling me about his late father, a\
  \ national legend who won multiple state awards for his work as a Wau master. His\
  \ most impressive piece is still hanging in the gallery, right behind his desk.\
  \ Sun rays were streaming on its glaring facade, creating a kite shadow right in\
  \ front of Anuar\u2019s working space, almost as a compass guiding his inspiration.\
  \ \n\n  As I was listening to the anecdotes Anuar candidly shared, I realised that\
  \ he is not like the other adults of his age. He is among those ever-young spirits\
  \ trapped in an ageing body. He seems not to care much about status, money or time.\
  \ Yet this child-like attitude should not be mistaken with gullibility or carelessness.\
  \ Rather, he lives by the wisdom of those who spend more energy doing what they\
  \ love than trying to meet external standards. And from that perspective, he is\
  \ himself as free as a flying Wau.\n\n  As I left the gallery, I turned around and\
  \ looked through the small window facing Anuar\xB4s desk, and couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but smile at the irony which brought me here in the first place."
