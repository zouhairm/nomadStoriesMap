Text: "I dove in the cold ocean water, wet suit on, as well as my diving mask and\
  \ snorkel. It was my last day on the island and until that moment I hadn\u2019t\
  \ had any close encounters with those peculiar animals who populate the Great Barrier\
  \ Reef, except for many sorts of fish, so I had decided to get up quite early that\
  \ day hoping I would be luckier. \nI swam away from the jetty and towards the rusty\
  \ shipwreck that laid on the reef, already beginning to feel warmer. Around me thousands\
  \ of different species of fish were swimming in shoals, coming and going in all\
  \ directions, some of them hiding behind the bits of coral. It would have been a\
  \ blaze of colours, the one you see in documentaries or \u201CFinding Nemo\u201D\
  , if only the coral still had its typical reds and oranges. Unfortunately, due to\
  \ global warming, the reef I experienced was paler than what I\u2019d expected.\
  \ But still magical. \nIt was the first time I had ever snorkelled and I was finding\
  \ the experience sublime. Heron Island, as many other reef islands is known for\
  \ its beautiful reef landscapes and multitude of types of animals, both on land\
  \ and at sea, including reef sharks, manta rays and turtles. In the past few days\
  \ we had been lucky enough to experience the magic of baby turtles hatching, an\
  \ act which proves how fascinating the world we live in can be. \n\u201CGuys there\u2019\
  s a giant turtle!\u201D Caleb shouted all of a sudden. I had just lifted my head\
  \ above the water to catch some air, when I realized that the guy who shouted was\
  \ not far from me. I immediately fixed my snorkel and dove back underwater, and\
  \ there it was. Not further than a meter from me, it was so close I felt I could\
  \ almost touch it. I couldn\u2019t though, I was determined to live that moment\
  \ in all its magnificence, just by watching. It was most definitely a Loggerhead\
  \ turtle, and a big one too. It swam in a regal way and didn\u2019t react to the\
  \ swimmers beside her at all. A thousand thoughts raced through my head, how old\
  \ was it? Was it a male or a female? I began to wonder how many places it could\
  \ have seen, as turtles are notoriously nomads. I was frozen still as it swam right\
  \ in front of me. It then caught some fresh air by popping its nostrils above the\
  \ water level and then slowly, but majestically, floated away leaving us all in\
  \ pure amazement.\nWhen I had first decided to go on a 5 months exchange to Australia,\
  \ I surely would have never thought that I would have been lucky enough to join\
  \ a school trip to a reef island, let alone swimming close to an extraordinary animal,\
  \ such as a turtle. But there I was, in awe of what had just happened. \nWe swam\
  \ for another while and then went back to the Research Station where we had spent\
  \ the previous nights. \n\u201CThat was truly amazing\u201D Sebastian said. For\
  \ most of the other students on the trip it was the first time on such an adventure,\
  \ so we all shared the same feelings. \u201CIt was,\u201D I replied \u201CI will\
  \ never forget such a moment, it\u2019s certainly not something you\u2019d experience\
  \ every day, and certainly not in Italy!\u201D we both laughed, cherishing our last\
  \ few hours left on that tropical paradise. \nThose few hours went by, and soon\
  \ enough we were on the jetty, waiting to board the ship, knowing it was the means\
  \ to take us back to our everyday lives. \nI sat down by the window and stared at\
  \ the canopies dancing in the wind, surrounded by all sorts of birds. As the ship\
  \ started to leave the shore, I began thinking about the many experiences I lived\
  \ during that week. I had done so much in just seven days, so many things I probably\
  \ would\u2019ve had to wait a long time to repeat, and I realised how lucky I had\
  \ gotten. Being 17 and able to tell such stories wasn\u2019t common at all. I caught\
  \ the last glimpse of the island and smiled."
