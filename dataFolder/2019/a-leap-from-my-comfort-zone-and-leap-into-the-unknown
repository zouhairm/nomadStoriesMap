Text: "I was joking to some friends that I want to have a job where I don\u2019t need\
  \ to wear shoes or socks (understand that I\u2019ve been wearing combat boots for\
  \ more than 15 years of service).\nI\u2019m a young person but I\u2019ve spent much\
  \ of my life already with the military. With that I had great opportunity to travel\
  \ a lot, but for the most part I didn\u2019t get to always immerse myself in a culture\
  \ or get to see it outside of how the troops interacted with the local community.\
  \ I\u2019ve been looking for a way to do something with my life that seems like\
  \ it has more meaning than me.\nThe military\u2019s been a great opportunity but\
  \ there\u2019s so much I haven\u2019t been able to take in.  A fresh breath of air\
  \ on a summer day is something that\u2019s foreign to me. I can see me getting the\
  \ chance to walk on the beach while doing this, which may seem clich\xE9 but it\u2019\
  s not. For some people all we do is work and never stop to take a moment and be\
  \ present in the life we created. I\u2019ve been done with the military for the\
  \ past three years and in that change looking for a Segway to transition my life\
  \ using the inconsistency of the movement I\u2019m use to, from the military, that\
  \ can be in my job. \nI recently heard a story that in Portugal people are going\
  \ there to surf the incredible waves that they have. Apparently, it\u2019s one of\
  \ the biggest surf\u2019s that isn\u2019t crowded with people as much as Australia\
  \ or Hawaii. I\u2019m not trying to be in the group of the expedition surfing crew,\
  \ I want to go there as an expedition traveler and free citizen to roam the earth.\
  \ My goal is to get out and explore the world and all it has to offer, to see somewhere\
  \ I haven\u2019t been at least once or twice a year. Seeing so many cultures has\
  \ let me know that we\u2019re all connected in some way. We all want to know who\
  \ else is there, and we all want to know what we all share in common besides the\
  \ oxygen and sunlight. I\u2019ve had such a great time with the military, that living\
  \ abroad is my next goal and to be able to write about an experience will help me\
  \ in making my next leap. Traveling is now in my DNA, I get excited to see a new\
  \ place and Portugal is one of the few that\u2019s so diverse but is one that\u2019\
  s still pristinely rich in culture, history, and has kept its own tradition while\
  \ coming into 2019. That\u2019s very hard to do yet they\u2019ve somehow maintained\
  \ their individual cultural presence.\nI enjoy getting to dance like locals, I can\
  \ feel the wind from the movement of the fabric of my dress as I try to move in\
  \ synchrony. I can see myself having a conversation in their dialect of Castilian\
  \ and finding out what makes it distinct from the next region. Talking to people\
  \ with your hands and body language the art of learning more than your own primary\
  \ language and appreciating another culture before it\u2019s gone is something I\
  \ can\u2019t imagine not doing. This opportunity may be the first time I can do\
  \ that by breathing in the summer air at a bistro realizing this isn\u2019t an Instagram\
  \ perfect Eat, Pray, Love moment but a living in the present moment. There may be\
  \ local insects and a few people bickering in the background, while the sun is setting\
  \ and I\u2019m there on the first day upset because my luggage is lost or stolen\
  \ but at least I will know I took a chance. The chance to step outside of the comforts\
  \ of the military and tried a new experience on my own, to live abroad briefly.\
  \ Looking back and thinking while planning my next venture and learning the lesson\
  \ of how to blend in and appreciate a culture that isn\u2019t mine and how many\
  \ people aren\u2019t able to step away from their safe zone. Traveling isn\u2019\
  t something we do it\u2019s something we live in the moment of."
