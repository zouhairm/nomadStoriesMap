Text: "I placed my suitcase on the bed, unzipped the tightly packed pockets and pulled\
  \ out my jacket, only to hear a loud thump on the ground. In my carelessness, a\
  \ safely tucked snow globe had now smashed to the ground. I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ think this moment epitomised so much of what I had just experienced; two weeks\
  \ traveling a city I now, rather affectionately, call a snow globe city. Idyllic,\
  \ full of picturesque moments, easily broken and covered by a facade. The people\
  \ and their stories gave me a deep sense that the city we see in movies is not the\
  \ same city of their reality; and yet, amidst the prevalent heartbreak, there is\
  \ a tenacity to the stories of this city. \n\nI hardly remember my first couple\
  \ of days traveling the snow globe-city, a blur of jetlag and deep-fried food, but\
  \ I remember the day I first started hearing stories from the people who call this\
  \ city home. I sat in the only empty seat I could see, right in the middle of the\
  \ theatre. The lady next to me introduced herself with such enthusiasm, \u201CHi!\u201D\
  \ Before I knew it, she and I were driving to grab late night pizza while she told\
  \ me how she had just been signed to an agency. It had been years of cleaning houses,\
  \ barely making ends meet, but she finally felt \u201Con track\u201D with her acting\
  \ career. Making my way across the city, I felt as though I carried a magnet for\
  \ drawing in stories, the raw tales of this city.\n\n \u201CI build things.\u201D\
  \ There was such confidence as he said it repeatedly, \u201CI build things\u201D\
  . He was an app designer and \u201Call-round creative\u201D. He told me a story\
  \ he jokingly self-titled, \u201CHow I made it\u201D. \u201CI always knew I\u2019\
  d make it, I would tell myself, it will be different for me than it was for my brother.\u201D\
  \ It wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d heard this sentiment and it wasn\u2019\
  t the last on the trip. More often, the sentiment was followed by a ramble of disappointment.\
  \ As he continued, I realised he was no stranger to rejection, but I could also\
  \ feel his tenacity rise up. In the cracks and crevasses of this city\u2019s brokenness,\
  \ you see creativity peeping through. Innovation hustles its way out of bank account\
  \ rock bottoms. Right on cue, like it was a movie, he started telling me how YouTube\
  \ came to be his main source of income. I laughed to myself, \u201COf course!\u201D\
  . He now sells content to some of the largest media outlets in the world. \n\nEvery\
  \ story gave me a clearer lens to see behind touristy facades. My mind became a\
  \ melting pot of these stories, the DNA of the city was simmering to the top; heartbreak,\
  \ but an unbreakable tenacity. Through each interaction I had, my understanding\
  \ of the city, and empathy for its people, grew. \n\nThere were many moments in\
  \ Uber\u2019s, as I made my way from Downtown and to the West side, but I haven\u2019\
  t been able to shake this one. The driver told me his son had caught Lyme Disease.\
  \ By the time they realised, it was beyond the point where doctors look at you hopefully\
  \ and tell you positive stories for the future. They\u2019d moved from New York;\
  \ treatments seemed to go well for a while and then not so much. He and his wife\
  \ work long hours, Ubering between other jobs. Things didn\u2019t work out with\
  \ their health insurance the way they\u2019d hoped. Nervously, he laughed and looked\
  \ at me, \u201CEveryone in this city has a story. In fact, people come here because\
  \ they have a story to tell. Without a story, without a dream, you won\u2019t survive\
  \ in this city.\u201D The drive ended and he waited for me to get out of the car.\
  \ I smiled and said, \u201CI\u2019m believing with you for your son.\u201D He smiled\
  \ confidently back. Again, the tenacity to hope was palatable. \n\nThis is how I\
  \ experienced the city; in the vulnerable heartbreak and effervescent tenacity of\
  \ each story; these are the stories behind the touristy veneer, this is Los Angeles."
