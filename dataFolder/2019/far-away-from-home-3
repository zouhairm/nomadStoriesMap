Text: "Steam wrapped the side of her body as I moved through the wooden door frame\
  \ to the kitchen. So entrenched in her morning routine she didn\u2019t hear me come\
  \ in. Her movements were fluid; each act a swift motion without hesitation. It was\
  \ clear that this routine was one performed many times before I had ever gotten\
  \ arrived and would continue well beyond my departure.\nI stepped, scrapping my\
  \ foot slightly along the pebbled floor. The sound audible enough to announce my\
  \ presence. Lucia, momentarily startled, turned on the spot and smiled unassumingly\
  \ in my direction.\n\u201CHola,\u201D I said with a smile in a soft voice, \u201C\
  Puedo ayudar?\u201D It was as much Spanish as I could muster. I am not fluent in\
  \ Spanish, but neither was Lucia.\nI was near the border between Bolivia and Peru,\
  \ in a small village on the shore of Lake Titicaca. The local people here traditionally\
  \ speak Aymara. Lucia and her family were nice enough to host me in their family\
  \ as a homestay. We had been knitting together conversation between our collective\
  \ broken Spanish since I had arrived the night before.\nShe smiled again and motioned\
  \ for me to come closer, towards the wood burner stove. Lucia was the mother of\
  \ the household; her hair in two long braids tumbled down her back to sit at the\
  \ belt of her skirt. All the women in the village dressed proudly in vibrant coloured\
  \ dresses and skirts like she did.\nI stood near her, and she reached out and took\
  \ my hand in hers. Her skin felt rough, the kind of rough that only comes from doing\
  \ farm work your whole life. The sudden familiarity that I felt took me by surprise.\
  \ I had been travelling for more than two months alone through South America and\
  \ it was the longest I had ever been away from my own family. Lucia was nothing\
  \ like my mother in terms of looks but the air she carried about her, the nurturing\
  \ presence, the warmth of the quinoa soup bubbling away on the stove top; it all\
  \ reminded me of family. \nI helped her make traditional Peruvian flat bread. We\
  \ kneaded the dough, stretching it rhythmically with our fingers out into palm sized\
  \ disks and baked them over the fire. The quinoa soup bubbled endlessly away and\
  \ for a moment I forgot that I was so far away from home."
