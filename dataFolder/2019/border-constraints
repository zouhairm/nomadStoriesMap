Text: "For how long will you be staying in Netherlands? \"asked the immigration officer\
  \ before issuing an entry stamp. The issue  about visas and immigration policies\
  \ in  creating inequality around movement as I flash back to remember the tideous\
  \ process undertaken by myself and colleagues from community based organizations\
  \ that were attending the AIDS 2018 conference in Amsterdam. To obtain a visa  required\
  \ an individual to have an Invitation letter, bookings for accommodation, flight\
  \ reservation, travel insurance, police clearance, employer's recommendation, bank\
  \ statements and proof of being attached to your country such as land titles to\
  \ mention the least but that not being enough, persons in additional circumstances\
  \ were also required to do medical checks for certain illnesses and if married ,\
  \ they had to submit marriage certificates and information about their families.\
  \ In spite of being in possession of all these requirements, it was  never guaranteed\
  \ that I could still be allowed entry even if I had already been issued a visa before\
  \ my pre-departure by the embassy. \nMy heart lurched after  I got detained because\
  \  I had told the immigration officer that I would be staying in Netherlands for\
  \ seven days. During detention, I met a middle-aged white man from the US named\
  \ Smith  being fined for over speeding during his last visit in Brussels. Data and\
  \ security information in the schengen visa system kept track of previous records\
  \ including petty crimes committed throughout the stay. \"I think I saw you back\
  \ in Uganda at the airport, \"he said. I nodded my head in agreement with my eyes\
  \ roving across the silent room. \"For how long have you been in Uganda? \" I questioned.\
  \ He chuckled and replied to me that he had  been on a safari trekking wildlife\
  \  in East Africa. Our conversation soon got interrupted by the stern look of the\
  \ tempestuous officer who had walked into the room to return our passports. Traveling\
  \ to anywhere in the world appeared to be candies and fun for Smith because of privilege\
  \ holding a passport from  the global north that he could one day wake up to satiate\
  \ of his voracious  desires of  watching gregarious animals in a safari park. He\
  \ barely had any visa in his passport but also knew little about application processes\
  \ and denials. \nAs I was seated in situ in a shuttle veering to the hotel, I looked\
  \ through the pellucid window to see ebullient white people riding  bicycles in\
  \ the gusto of  summer. It never occurred to them to ponder about such privilege\
  \ and freedom that  they had in unquestionable movement akin to birds in the beach\
  \ sky. For  my case, I  simply could have been deported back to Africa for staying\
  \ two days extra after the conference but there I was addled and jet lagged in a\
  \ jacuzzi thinking about how it might probably have been a different story living\
  \ the life of Smith. The allure of daylight saving with  the sun gradually dissolving\
  \ into a pale pink flash of twilight that I nevertheless  had to toast with a glass\
  \ of wine to the fruition for this victorious journey and looked forward to retelling\
  \ that experience with the rest of the world. 'It is not how far you have travelled\
  \ to make the journey but rather in what you have over come along the journey.'\
  \ Cheers!"
