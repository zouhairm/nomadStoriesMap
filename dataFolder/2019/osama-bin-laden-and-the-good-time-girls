Text: "On Easter Monday in 2011, I celebrated two things that I never thought I would\
  \ commemorate: the historic return of prostitutes to the city of Salamanca, Spain,\
  \ and the defeat of the world\u2019s most infamous terrorist. It was Lunes de Aguas,\
  \ and the night before, Osama bin Laden had been killed. \n\nOn that overcast afternoon,\
  \ I met up with Carlos, a salamantino whom I had befriended early into my three-month\
  \ stay in Spain. \u201CCongratulations,\u201D he intoned, smirking, when he saw\
  \ me in the Plaza Mayor. \u201CYou must be very proud.\u201D\n\nHe was, of course,\
  \ not referring to the holiday itself, but rather to bin Laden\u2019s death. This\
  \ figured into a game that we sometimes played \u2013 a dynamic in which I was the\
  \ obnoxious American tourist, and he was the disdainful European. We liked to call\
  \ ourselves the odd couple.\n\nCarlos was the first person to tell me about Lunes\
  \ de Aguas, and I initially thought that he was seeing how gullible I was. The fiesta\
  \ goes all the way back to the 16th century, when Philip II, still a prince, visited\
  \ Salamanca. A pious man, even at a young age, he was shocked by the lewd, pagan\
  \ tendencies of the city\u2019s denizens. Consequently, he issued an edict banning\
  \ prostitutes from Salamanca during Lent. \n\nOn Easter Monday, the mujeres de vida\
  \ alegre (good-time girls) would return by boat. The young people of the city, deprived\
  \ and ready to party, would descend upon the banks of the r\xEDo Tormes to greet\
  \ the women. Everyone would eat, drink, and be merry, among other things. \n\nToday,\
  \ on Lunes de Aguas, no women return by boats, shepherded by a paternalistic priest.\
  \ But the fiesta still exists, and thousands of people celebrate each year. On our\
  \ way to the river, Carlos and I stopped for hornazo, a meat and egg pie traditionally\
  \ eaten on Lunes de Aguas. \n\nCarlos was not the first Spaniard that I met on my\
  \ trip, but he was the nicest. When I arrived alone, laden with luggage, I struggled\
  \ to navigate the cobblestone streets. In Madrid, I rejoiced when a group of men\
  \ helped me carry my bags aboard the train. 'And they say you can\u2019t rely on\
  \ the kindness of strangers,' I thought to myself sagely, until the men surrounded\
  \ me and attempted to relieve me of my phone and wallet. \n\nUnfortunately for them,\
  \ my pants were so skintight that their ringleader could not plunge his hands deep\
  \ enough into my pockets. Realizing the futility of his actions, he looked from\
  \ me to his comrades, and then aborted the robbery, alighting from the train right\
  \ before the doors closed. \u201CDon\u2019t worry,\u201D I said to my fellow passengers,\
  \ who glanced around nervously. \u201CI\u2019m okay!\u201D \n\nCarlos thought this\
  \ was about the funniest thing he\u2019d ever heard when I worked up the courage\
  \ to tell him. \u201CWatch your pockets,\u201D he said to me, half-kidding, as we\
  \ entered the throng of revellers by the river. The banks were packed with families,\
  \ university students, and Europeans on their Erasmus years. A pervasive din hung\
  \ over the crowds, and a sea of different languages could be heard. \n\nOn a nearby\
  \ hill, a group of boys waved an American flag, periodically chanting \u201CUSA!\
  \ USA! USA!\u201D \n\n\u201CYour friends?\u201D Carlos asked. \n\n\u201CMy brothers,\
  \ actually,\u201D I laughed. But there was an eerie feeling in the pit of my stomach\
  \ that only grew worse as I sipped too-sweet sangria. I was not a fan of Osama bin\
  \ Laden, but I was also uncomfortable with such a brazen celebration of death. \n\
  \t\nWhat\u2019s more, words had failed me: I had no way to describe how I was feeling,\
  \ in English or Spanish. \n\nThere was something about being out of my element,\
  \ in terra incognita, that made me think of ghosts. When I left the United States,\
  \ giddy with excitement over the prospect of traveling, I expected to find the future.\
  \ Instead, I walked right into the past. \n\nI was eighteen then, with my whole\
  \ future ahead of me, but I squinted hard at the water, trying to forget about a\
  \ terrorist and envision the reason for the celebration: the past \u2013 women appearing\
  \ on the river, like an oasis, and men dancing in their honor."
