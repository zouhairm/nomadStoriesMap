Text: "Traveling may seem just an adventure to discover the new world you have never\
  \ been to, but to me, making a connection and creating a life in one place can change\
  \ ones life forever. Whenever I visit places, I always loved to observe the people\
  \ in it, locals. Looking how different their way of lives surely had a huge impact\
  \ in mine. Recently, I lived in New York City for a year and my reaction is just\
  \ overwhelming. It\u2019s been couple of days and remembering to see different races\
  \ and countless of different languages you can hear everyday was mind blowing. That\u2019\
  s when I knew, I am hungry for more and to meet new people would be my new travel\
  \ goal now. I made new friends from all over the world, I loved listening to their\
  \ stories, especially their cultures, it\u2019s just really amazing. It would make\
  \ you want to visit their country one day. To me, everyday living in a city of diversity\
  \ is just, for me, the beauty of one place. How do I keep these in account besides\
  \ taking pictures? Writing. I have a journal that I called \u201CThe Not So Daily\
  \ Journal\u201D because I write whenever I felt just to write. Whenever I just simply\
  \ bump into one person and have a deep conversation or just by eating at a taco\
  \ truck, makes a great story. Everything to me just by that experience is truly\
  \ an unforgettable one and I would love to inspire others to go outside of their\
  \ box and discover what each place has to offer, the people."
