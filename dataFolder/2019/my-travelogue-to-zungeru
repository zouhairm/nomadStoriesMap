Text: "Normally,the morning was too early to witness my consciousness, 8am was still\
  \ a child to my usual arose time. On the bike i hopped on, too high, i felt like\
  \ a child,like I was sitting in the air and didn't pay attention to the happenings\
  \ in motion,I was soaked in my pleasurable feelings,the breeze was utterly seductive;\
  \ unfairly enough, the happenings around passed by my awareness, fifteen minutes\
  \ after I arrived Hilltop Art Center,there, the other members were gathered in their\
  \ bluish polo T-shirt waiting for the arrival of the rest.\nBefore now, I only passed\
  \ by Zungeru to and from Sokoto,the thought of having to explore into the town awakened\
  \ my excitement. \nThe time clocked 9:30 am,i was sitting in the small bus,that\
  \ was the precise time we took off,there were four ladies at the front seat,myself\
  \ inclusive and the others in the back seats were all men,then the driver,then beside\
  \ him, the Uncle who speaks like an English man. I watched the first car drove while\
  \ the other car drove behind ours,the car made a right turn towards Al- amin International\
  \ school,in motion my eyes took grasp of the colour variety on its walls, the painting\
  \ reflects a beautiful work of art, just like those by little talented nursery pupils.\n\
  Seven minutes passed and \"Sabon Gari junction\" which towards Bahago, connects\
  \ us to \"FLay out junction\" appeared and fades away from our sight. As smooth\
  \ as the drive was, we passed swiftly, by a Specialist Hospital which after a right\
  \ turn,carried us to the traffic light after which is Zenith Bank.\nIt was 9:57am\
  \ at Chiromawa Gate,then to Zarmai round about then to Ahmadu Bello Secondary School,\
  \ I knew too many people that attended the school,its structure is tattered, shattered\
  \ with faded paintings.\nOne swift right turn turned all of us along,the gripping\
  \ entrance gate of FUT Minna called my eyes till we passed by the Bosso flyover.\n\
  I wondered why the bus stopped until I saw two other members entering the other\
  \ car.\nThe driver maintained the usual speed,the silence in the bus is typical\
  \ to the wont of journeys,after a few minutes drive, there was this man that stood\
  \ by the road,wearing a green armless jacket, it resembles that worn by road safety\
  \ workers. Then the turn to Tudun Fulani, we forgot Garima Pharmacy and Store behind.\n\
  Gradually, the happenings in Maikunkele surrendered before our awareness,\nAt 10:29\
  \ am, we arrived Maikunkele mini market, to survey the market, others made it a\
  \ journalist mission, i only walked around.\nFew minutes later, Butu village which\
  \ is less than a kilometer to Bobol village arrested our sight,a village with numbered\
  \ houses then to Bejji,another village famous for its yam farming. After kaliko\
  \ pri.and sec. School we reached Zungeru.\nZungeru is a local town with poor social\
  \ amenities, disastrous roads,unreliable power supply,ruined historical structures\
  \ and suspended development, a town which should pride itself as the supposed capital\
  \ of Nigeria, is rather subjected to abandonment, though it served as the first\
  \ Headquarters of the Nigerian based West Africa frontier Of the imperialist of\
  \ British. The community arrests so many intriguing places of History, The large\
  \ community hall,the Government House and Bridge, the Military Barracks, The swimming\
  \ pool and flower pots etc. The amazing palace of the district head,\"Dogaci\" two\
  \ bedroom flat of Dr Nnamdi Azikwe,the dam of 1901, Lord Lugard's cemetery, the\
  \ presidential villa, amalgamation park and manh more,  we visited, yhere \"The\
  \ Niger state polytechnic\" is also located. The town procreates,hard working youths\
  \ who were seen under the bridges, fishing, some had the fish fried and sold it\
  \ on a wide table beside the roads, fishing seems to be the historical preoccupation\
  \ of the community practiced till date,farming and butchering inclusive. The people\
  \ still earn through forgotten occupations,selling smooth rind of tiny tree branches\
  \ often found with herdsmen. The town is in Wushishi Local Government area of Niger\
  \ state,it is surrounded by small towns of Tegina, Kagara, Minna, and Wushishi.\n\
  At 4:52pm we hit the road back to Minna, it was same small hut like buildings in\
  \ the small villages,the plantations by each sides of the road, the drive was quite\
  \ smooth. At 5:50pm we reaches Minna, Niger state."
