Text: "You\u2019ve got to love this work and this land to be in the field by five-thirty\
  \ in the morning; it doesn\u2019t hurt either if you happen to love wine.\n\nIt\u2019\
  s still dark when my alarm goes off on Saturday, a couple of hours earlier than\
  \ the day before. Here, at a simple country house attached to an old cantina (winery),\
  \ the weekends are not work-free. On the contrary: there are more hands to help\
  \ with green pruning, a key step to prepare vines for the summer harvest. The stakes\
  \ are high, as the pruning has to be completed within few weeks, and the May weather\
  \ can be capricious, lashing the island down with rain.\n\nIt will soon be two years\
  \ since Floriana and Pasquale, my hosts, bought an ancient vineyard at the footsteps\
  \ of Etna. The wine-making has a long tradition on Sicily; the Sicilian soil, they\
  \ explain, has unique properties (it\u2019s a combination of sun exposure, altitude,\
  \ and the presence of minerals), which gave birth to a native species of vine. I\u2019\
  m surprised by its inconspicuous looks: curled like bonsai trees, with dark, wrinkled\
  \ trunks, each over a hundred-years-old \u2013 it\u2019s to these vines that Floriana\
  \ and Pasquale devote every spare hour of their day.\n\nAs soon as I wake up, I\
  \ light up the rusty gas stove and put on a steel moka. Just when it starts to sizzle,\
  \ it\u2019s time to go. I down the caffeine shot without blinking, and the next\
  \ thing I know I am at the back of a trusty old range rover. \n\nIn fifteen minutes\
  \ we arrive at a vineyard, the one which my hosts \u2018rent\u2019, which means\
  \ they take care of it, in exchange for the fruit and the use of wine-processing\
  \ equipment. On the spot we are joined by Floriana\u2019s parents and a local worker.\
  \ Together with Seku, a Gambian refugee who\u2019s also staying at the house, we\
  \ are seven. The plan is to finish pruning the vineyard, which stretches further\
  \ than I can see, by two at the latest.\n\nBeing the least experienced, I pair up\
  \ with Floriana\u2019s mum. She doesn\u2019t speak English but it doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ much; it\u2019s a silent job most of the time, and I can easily get by with filo,\
  \ per favore when I run out of string. That said, there are times when a conversation\
  \ suddenly takes off among the Italian speakers: I listen for words I recognise\
  \ and try to follow. Everyone is curious to know more about Gambia; I figure out\
  \ that Floriana\u2019s father has asked Seku if he\u2019s ever had hippo\u2019s\
  \ meat, and crocodile\u2019s, and giraffe\u2019s. Then they turn to talking about\
  \ food: what they will have for lunch, or for dinner, or what preserves they are\
  \ going to make; it seems there is never a bad time to talk about that. It\u2019\
  s a moment before I realise that the conversation has been dropped, and that everyone\
  \ has gone off to prune a different row of vines, each in a distant corner of the\
  \ vineyard.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this aware of the journey\
  \ of the sun in the early morning hours, all the way to its zenith; how it gradually\
  \ drinks up water off the ground and warms up the air. It is probably around nine\
  \ when I apply the sunscreen, put on sun-glasses and a cap \u2013 something only\
  \ I\u2019ll be seen doing.\n\nWe break for lunch shortly before noon but it feels\
  \ later than that \u2013 we\u2019ve been working for over six hours. I sense that\
  \ the others are reluctant to leave the field, they could easily go on for longer.\
  \ Lunch is perhaps too big a word \u2013 we tear off chunks of baguette and cheese,\
  \ follow them with small, sour peaches picked from the tree, all of that while sitting\
  \ on wooden crates turned upside down. It\u2019s only when we\u2019ve sat down that\
  \ the heat begins to settle, causing my fingers to swell. The thermos filled with\
  \ coffee passes from hands to hands in silence; tired smiles circulate instead of\
  \ words. Bound by coffee and bound by work: at that precise moment I feel I\u2019\
  ve been accepted as a member of this extended Italian family."
