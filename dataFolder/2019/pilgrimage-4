Text: "Pilgrimage\nBy Chen Shuhao\n\nAs we walked down from the locally renowned \u201C\
  1234 Steps\u201D mountain through steep and narrow stairs with several exhausted\
  \ people, the sun was just going to put on her flame-red veil and turned back against\
  \ the world. The air could be so refreshing in Thailand, especially in a well-vegetated\
  \ mountain area after several drops of kind rain. Doug took off his new shirt and\
  \ wrung the sweat out. \u201CA journey of Pilgrimage, isn\u2019t it?\u201D he said,\
  \ looking at the praying palms picture and \u201CPilgrimage\u201D on the shirt,\
  \ \u201CI never thought it would be so hard to take 1234 steps to get on the top.\u201D\
  \ \u201CYeah,\u201D I answered, as I sat on my borrowed motorbike, \u201Cotherwise\
  \ they won\u2019t tell you things like \u2018you will see stunning views up there\u2019\
  .\u201D Girls sat on the back of our motorbikes and we headed for our rented home.\
  \ \n\nMonica sat behind me, falling asleep in a minute. She liked to kill the \u201C\
  waste time\u201D when commuting by meeting the god of sleep with the help of Lana\
  \ Del Rey. Doug and Cecilia drove so fast in front of us like they were running\
  \ after the sun. It was my first time driving a motorbike and I felt like I was\
  \ a mom carrying her baby carefully and walking on the road, especially in a foreign\
  \ country where people drive so fast. Doug was also a green hand but he always dreamed\
  \ of being a cool guy riding a fantastic motor with his girl on his back. I kind\
  \ of enjoyed myself: the summer air breezed into my lung, nameless insects made\
  \ noises as if they were crying out the summertime sadness, young students wearing\
  \ clean uniforms were finally able to get a breath from the school, the sea stayed\
  \ quiet taking on a crimson look and some gentle lights were lit up just like the\
  \ stars over the sky.\n\nI enjoyed driving with all my attention, even melodies\
  \ were disturbing vibes. I felt strange when driving toward an asphalt road where\
  \ the black substance was so thick on the left edge making it looked like a small\
  \ stair to the sand ground under it. The head of the motor was so heavy that made\
  \ me felt even more uncomfortable than riding a bike. As I was looking at the road,\
  \ I heard a thud which came so unexpectedly before I could even say a word.\n\n\
  The motor of Doug and Cecilia ran down the asphalt stair but Doug stopped the motor\
  \ suddenly out of fear so they landed the ground with a thud. The motor turned on\
  \ its side.\n\nResidents came together quickly to check out what happened here.\
  \ As they expected, the dangerous \u201Casphalt stair\u201D was a \u201Cmotor killer\u201D\
  \ in this place. A guy wearing blue shirt came forward and supported Doug with his\
  \ hands. Monica came back from her dream and trying to figure out the whole scenario\
  \ as we pulled our motor. Cecilia didn\u2019t get hurt but Doug was not that lucky.\
  \ His head was bleeding and clearly he got several scratches on the back. The man\
  \ invited us into his store and had a sit. \u201CDr. Fish\u201D had many swimsuit\
  \ and diving equipment in the room. People made a life by catching fish and selling\
  \ suits to people who came to scuba diving at a seaside town in Thailand. We were\
  \ so lucky that Dr. Fish was a doctor. He poured normal saline over the wound on\
  \ Doug\u2019s leg and applied iodine around the bleeding part. \n\nAlmost nothing\
  \ in his store could be claimed \u201Cexpensive\u201D. \u201CDr. Fish\u201D was\
  \ healthily swarthy and wearing an old pair of sandal which were easy to take off.\
  \ He kept talking, trying to know everything about the people and place where we\
  \ came from. \n\nDoug had to throw his new T-shirt away. The \u201CPilgrimage\u201D\
  \ was scratched but the palms were still praying. \u201CIn China, we also have so\
  \ many kind people like you and we all make a sufficient living only speaking in\
  \ different languages, yet there are so many beautiful stories waiting for us to\
  \ explore\u201D I said. \u201CLike Pilgrimage?\u201D, \u201CDr. Fish\u201D smiled."
