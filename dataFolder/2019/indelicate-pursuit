Text: "I can't explain why holding a Lesser Antillean Iguana in my hands fills me\
  \ with such deep contentment, considering it looks like a piece of medieval weaponry\
  \ and feels like a dead foot, but somehow it does.\n\nI\u2019m a volunteer on the\
  \ island of Sint Eustatius in the Dutch Caribbean, helping researchers to catch\
  \ and tag members of this critically endangered species in an effort to monitor\
  \ the population. The one I\u2019m currently holding is a chunky adult female, the\
  \ patchy green colour of mossy tarmac, with a compact, armoured snout and a ridge\
  \ of slate-grey spikes running down her spine. She has just been unceremoniously\
  \ dislodged from a tree by a park ranger wielding a fishing pole. I hold her elbows\
  \ clamped to her sides with one hand, gripping her ankles with the other, her clawed\
  \ feet like a bouquet of knives. Her tail, impossibly long, gives a barely perceptible\
  \ twitch. I stare into her baleful golden eye as she releases the lungful of breath\
  \ she\u2019s been holding, and I feel her deflate in my hands like a burst football.\
  \ My heart breaks a little bit. She feels like she\u2019s made of desiccated leather\
  \ and chicken-wire. She looks old as Time and just as implacable. I love her. \n\
  \nWherever one travels, there is always the question of how one\u2019s relationship\
  \ to the place will find its footing. Sometimes it\u2019s someone you meet, who\
  \ shows you around and shapes your impressions. Sometimes you fall in love with\
  \ the food first, or the music, or the landscape. On Sint Eustatius, somewhat unexpectedly,\
  \ this small disgruntled Jurassic relic is my way in. It\u2019s through learning\
  \ about her species that I come to understand the island. \n\nLook around. What\u2019\
  s her habitat? Spotting an iguana involves wandering around forests and scrubland\
  \ squinting into trees looking for a lizard whom millions of years of evolution\
  \ has equipped to blend invisibly into foliage. When you find one, it is usually\
  \ somewhere inconvenient, like a thicket of cactus, eyeing you with the ageless\
  \ reptilian gravity of a civil servant. I learn to identify various fruit trees\
  \ \u2013 gennip, soursop, sugarapple \u2013 although I\u2019m more likely to spot\
  \ an iguana wedged blithely amongst the two-inch bone-white needles of a gnarled\
  \ acacia, gazing down at me like a contemptuous great-aunt. \n\nLooking at the population\
  \ distribution I realise how much the weather can vary even on an island this tiny\
  \ (just 21km\xB2 ). There are few iguanas on the forested slopes of the volcano,\
  \ whose jagged rim snags every passing cloud, spilling cool rain into its crater.\
  \ They prefer the drier hills to the north, comparatively safe from humans and related\
  \ threats, from domestic pets to hostile architecture. An iguana skeleton dangles\
  \ from a chain-link fence near the fisheries, its bones bleaching in the sun. An\
  \ accidental casualty. \n\nEvery iguana counts. There are only a few hundred individuals\
  \ left here. The Latin name for this species, Iguana delicatissima, is telling.\
  \ These creatures were once hunted for meat \u2013 hardly surprising on an archipelago\
  \ with no large native mammals. These days, however, harming an iguana carries a\
  \ considerable fine and islanders willingly report sightings to the local ranger.\
  \ When I tag along to investigate a call about a majestic male that has taken up\
  \ residence in a hotel garden, the staff make jokes about herding him into the kitchen.\
  \ In the end, however, this substantial bachelor is safely relocated to the hills,\
  \ where an established colony of females should soften the indignity of his removal.\
  \ There are jokes about this too. Over the weeks, I get chatting to people who invite\
  \ me into their gardens and tell me about how the ecology has changed. Climate change\
  \ has brought frequent hurricanes that devastate habitat. Invasive species such\
  \ as goats decimate nesting grounds. Every time I\u2019m lucky enough to hold an\
  \ iguana in my hands I feel like I\u2019m holding a fragment of something precious\
  \ that is disappearing.\n\nThe ranger pierces her neck with a combination of coloured\
  \ beads, a unique identifier. I let her go and she slithers into the undergrowth.\
  \ I let her go but I still feel connected. I still feel the texture of her skin,\
  \ the flex of her ribs under my fingertips."
