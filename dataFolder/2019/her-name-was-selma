Text: "HER NAME WAS SELMA.\nHIS? I DON\u2019T CARE TO REMEMBER.\n\nThey were heroine\
  \ addicts\u2026except, he still was.\nI could smell it on him;\nI could see it in\
  \ his eyes.\n\nHer eyes, though, crystal blue, and shaking.\nStill in love with\
  \ that\nlying bastard.\nI just remember her smile\u2026\n\u2026like a little girl\
  \ riding a carousel, for the first time on her \nfavourite colour horse, or the\
  \ unicorn.\n\nThe bus left Zagreb around 11a.m., a three and half hour ride \nAround\
  \ the Republic of Srpska. \nMy boyfriend slept the entire way,\nAs I watched a blown\
  \ out landscape slide by.\n\nA Bosnian military man staring at my back the whole\
  \ time.\nThen\u2026The Checkpoint.\nHe just stood up, and stared at me.\nJay had\
  \ no idea; I did.\n(thankfully, I\u2019m six foot, and my father taught me how to\
  \ fight\nWhen he realized he had a gypsy traveling heart daughter.\n\nEntering Bugojno,\
  \ I passed the biggest U.N. base I\u2019d ever seen. FUCK.\nBoyfriend still asleep,\
  \ missing the beautiful hills of Bosnia, and blown up shit.\n(who sleeps through\
  \ that chance?!)\nThe bus came to a screeching halt.\nThe military man right behind\
  \ me, my just awoken Jay, ahead of me, \neyes on may back.\nWe grabbed our bags,\
  \ staring at least twenty kids; for, that bus was also the school bus.\n\nI jumped\
  \ ahead of Jay\u2026he didn\u2019t know where the center was?\nI said,\u201Dfollow\
  \ the line.\u201D\nThen I stopped, and he ran into me.\nI said\u201Dshit.\u2019\n\
  Him, \u201Csorry, what?\u201D\n\u201CI was just admiring their woodpecker problem.\u201D\
  \n\u201Cwhat?\u201D\n\u201CJoking, this is high artillery warfare, silly. Where\
  \ the fuck are we.\u201D\L\u201CReally?\u201D\n\u201CYes. Remember, my father was\
  \ an NRA arms dealer. Shit!\u201D\nHe had no idea, once again, what we were walking\
  \ into,\n I did.\nWELCOME TO BOSNIA.\n\nWaiting at the bus station for Arlen from\
  \ Austria, \nand Ashim from Bosnia.\nWe were picked up in a stereotypical white\
  \ abduction van.\nI\u2019m the only women, until\u2026I met Selma.\n\nWe arrived\
  \ to help reunite the youth of the former Yugoslavia Republic .\nIt was too late\
  \ for the adults.\nThe largest genocide, ethnic cleansing since WWII. \nAnd, Ironically,\
  \ bugojno is the city Gavrilo Princip stayed the night before, and traveled to \n\
  Sarajevo, while he was drinking a coffee, and the motorcade was rerouted. He ran\
  \ out to Latinski Most, and shot the bullets that were heard around the world.\n\
  It was Franz Ferdinand\u2019s, and Sophie\u2019s anniversary.\nThe Iron wall went\
  \ up.\n\nHaving come from the prostitute city of Trieste, starving!,\nArlen gave\
  \ us two bowls of Hungarian mushroom soup, and slivovitz, \nas I stared into Selma\u2019\
  s eyes. \nListening to 1/3 Austrian, 1/3 Bosnian, 1/3 English, me speaking Italian.\n\
  Selma was just staring at me.\nI would later realize she was asking for help, and\
  \ just companionship and to be understood.\n\nAfter we left the addicts behind we\
  \ were driven 13km into the Bosnian hills in the same white van. Surrounded by four\
  \ men, and my boyfriend, who couldn\u2019t defend me if he tried, and he would,\
  \ but please, let me handle this. First time I was ever truly scared.\nI knew  the\
  \ story could go very wrong..\nI turned to Jay, and said,\u2019\u201Dyou have to\
  \ have my back.\u201D\u201Dwhat?\u201D\u201Dfor fuck sake! Pay attention!\u201D\n\
  I ended up meeting some boy my best friends,\nAnd under a full blood moon.\nYou\
  \ cannot make this shit up\n\nSelma came almost everyday to watch me work, in wonder.\n\
  \u2018why you work?\u201D\n\u201Cwhy not married to him?\u2019\n\nThen none day,\
  \ while the Mesaharati was calling the Koran, during Ramadan\nSelma showed up\n\
  With a red bandana, exact to what Jay was wearing painting an image of Miles Davis\n\
  With the trumpet scar;\nI was painting the door of two people intertwined.\nShe\
  \ climbed in the car to ride with us home.\nHer ex had been removed to a high end\
  \ facility.\nShe handed me a warm bag of roasted chestnuts,\nSmiled with those big\
  \ Blue eyes,\nAnd grabbed my hand.\nWe rode in silence.\n\n1000 Violens\u201DTiger\
  \ Lillies\u201D\n\nAve Verum,\n\nMiss Amanda"
