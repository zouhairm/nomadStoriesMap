Text: "To be an atheist tour guide of Rome requires some restraint.  I don't mean\
  \ I have to hold back my opinions at the holy places of pilgrims.  I love that visitors\
  \ fall on their knees in the presence of a saint's bones, or that I can teach them\
  \ to walk tenderly across the loose mosaics in the oldest synagogue of Europe. \
  \ In a Mecca of so many religions, I do not come to connect with a deity but instead\
  \ to the complex layers of this city.  What I mean is that although I take tourists\
  \ to many of the most significant sites, I hold back a few sacred spaces for myself,\
  \ hoarding each beloved relic, a little guiltily and protectively.  Secreted away\
  \ in buildings I know by heart, I return to cherish my favorite places as my own\
  \ ritual.  My altars may not be in St. Peter\u2019s or the cobblestoned Jewish quarter,\
  \ but I feel the same sense of awe. \n \nOne such touchstone for me is hidden in\
  \ plain sight in the Basilica di San Sebastiano on the Via Appia, the ancient road\
  \ flanked by cypress trees.  First, I scan a dozen tickets and my tour group is\
  \ led by another guide into the cold tunnels of the catacombs that run for miles\
  \ underground.  I've walked the labyrinth so many times that by now I prefer the\
  \ warmer air, where dry leaves follow me into the caf\xE9 next door.  My friend\
  \ Donato works there, and though I see him only in the summers, he doesn't forget\
  \ my face.  The same smile, a kiss on the right cheek, then left, and he passes\
  \ me an espresso across the bar, always gratis, free. We talk about the fall of\
  \ Rome or new excavations and it's a chance to relax in the middle of a long day\
  \ on my feet.  The bitter wakefulness I crave in the sleepy mid-afternoon heat,\
  \ the jurassic aloe plants in the back garden, and the knowledge that a maze of\
  \ passageways twist just underneath us-- all this strange magic keeps me above ground,\
  \ year after year.  I want to rub the street cat\u2019s belly as she suns on cobblestones.\
  \  I want to overhear the Italian radio hosts chattering away, to revel inwardly.\
  \  Above all, I want to be in the land of the living, chewing on the thick rind\
  \ of the past.\n \nBy now the group has probably come to the burial chambers decorated\
  \ with early frescoes of Jesus carrying a lamb on his shoulders.  Soon, they\u2019\
  ll return upstairs, whispering about history and belief.  I take the caf\xE9 entrance\
  \ into the church portico, timing myself so that I have five minutes of quiet before\
  \ my work begins again.  The few tourists in the church are looking up at angels\
  \ and gilded wood.  \n \nBut here, on the tile of the church floor I know so well,\
  \ is the thick whorl of a nautilus shell.  It's faint yellow on beige, almost blended\
  \ into the rest of the tile. The first time I saw it, I almost tripped over it,\
  \ even though it was flat.  The geometry of the prehistoric fossil now feels so\
  \ familiar, like a human ear I could speak into if I knelt upon the floor.  What\
  \ could I say?  So close to me, tangible, is its perfect Fibonacci ratio, the curled\
  \ head of a violin.  The intelligence and mystery of our design is more real to\
  \ me in this small slab than in any statue or sermon. \n \nEvery summer, I touch\
  \ the nautilus shell for a moment, as if like a messiah's cloak I might gain courage\
  \ or healing from its smooth surface.  I leave a thumbprint of sweat.  There is\
  \ so much of Rome in that square foot of stone: the privacy of true beauty, its\
  \ antiquity even older than we imagine.  I hear the murmur of tour group, and turn\
  \ around to see them squinting as their eyes take in the light.  As we walk out\
  \ into the courtyard, I feel like I, too, have just come out of prayer."
