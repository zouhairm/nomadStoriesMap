Text: "It was dark. The wind chill plunged the temperature to depths well below freezing.\
  \ Snow crunched under my feet as I found my stride. I could faintly make out the\
  \ bewildered expressions of commuters illuminated by streetlights as they drove\
  \ past. Watching me run along the shoulder of the road, their puzzled faces all\
  \ asked the same question\u2026 why? I too pondered the question as my mind drifted\
  \ from the ice covered streets to the cobblestone courtyard outside the Grand Hotel\
  \ Begnas.\n\nVivid memories of damp morning air enveloped me as I pictured the peaks\
  \ of the Annapurna range surrounding me casting shadows through thick fog. It was\
  \ the autumn of 2016 and over 57 kilometers of unrelenting trails stood between\
  \ me and the finish line of my first ultra-marathon. My stomach churned with anxiety\
  \ as I hit the start button on my watch and stepped into the unknown.\n\nThe course\
  \ started by funneling down a narrow stone staircase which abruptly plopped onto\
  \ a wide dirt path. Toppled structures littered the landscape. Although outside\
  \ the epicenter of the massive earthquake which had struck Nepal the year prior,\
  \ this area was not untouched by its destruction. Meandering through small farm\
  \ communities and rice paddy fields I could make out silhouettes of people tending\
  \ to their daily chores. Young children rushed out with excitement to watch us.\
  \ They greeted us with folded hands and shouted \u2018Namaste!\u2019 as we passed.\
  \ I bowed my head, hands clasped at my chest returning their salutations.\n\nThe\
  \ pack of runners spread out quickly and I soon found myself alone. Stopping for\
  \ a moment, I admired the view from the valley as the last of the morning mist dissipated.\
  \ I followed course markers up weathered steps and over crumbling bridges high above\
  \ riverbeds. I was in decent shape but this course was a far stretch from the flat\
  \ trails I had trained on back home. My legs and lungs burned with exhaustion until\
  \ finally the path began to descend. I bounded downward for miles until I saw another\
  \ runner coming towards me.\n\n\u201CWe have to go back,\u201D he said through panting\
  \ breaths.\n\nWe were off course and needed to backtrack uphill. Along our ascent\
  \ to find the marker we had missed, we met another runner who had made the same\
  \ mistake. Our trio trekked together searching until we spotted a small orange flag\
  \ hanging from a limb, flapping in the breeze. We carried on in silence.\n\nThe\
  \ sun blazed overhead. My skin grew hot, my mouth dry and my thoughts hazy. Underfoot\
  \ the trail turned hard and rocky. My clothes were caked in salt stains and my feet\
  \ oozed wet with blood from torn blisters. Our group stopped for a short respite\
  \ and divided up the little remaining water we had among us. We pushed on chatting\
  \ idly through belabored breaths trying to distract ourselves from the constant\
  \ pain.\n\nA few hours later, we encountered a Nepali gentleman who agreed to take\
  \ us to get fresh water. He led us to the outskirts of a village where a group of\
  \ men with a small cooler offered us a drink. He then took us to a spot and informed\
  \ us that provided the road had been cleared after the most recent avalanche, a\
  \ bus would pass through and could give us a ride.\n\nDaylight was fading and so\
  \ were we when a dilapidated bus shimmied around the corner. We flagged it to a\
  \ stop. Tears of failure welled up in my eyes adding salt to the wounds of my physical\
  \ pain. I felt myself moving in slow motion as I reached down and hit the stop button\
  \ on my watch.\n\nI snapped back to the present as my watch beeped signaling another\
  \ mile. Freezing winds swept away lingering thoughts of the Nepali sun. The question\
  \ remained\u2026 why? Why was I out here struggling through the cold? Because I\
  \ left Nepal reduced to a shell but also empowered with knowledge of my thresholds\
  \ and what was required to reach beyond them. I knew the only path to growth was\
  \ to endure the discomforts of the unknown. With each footfall, like reverberating\
  \ aftershocks I pushed my limits further."
