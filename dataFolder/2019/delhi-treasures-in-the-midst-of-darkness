Text: "Adrenaline rush. Fear of coming across danger. Stranger\u2019s home. These\
  \ are the things which could explain in brief how I felt when I decided to go to\
  \ Delhi on March 8, 2016. When I was in the flight listening to the songs of \u201C\
  Queen\u201D, a Bollywood movie where the protagonist decides to go alone on her\
  \ honeymoon trip even after her wedding is canceled, I felt the same adrenaline\
  \ rush she carried. In fact, I felt foolish, idiotic and I became a critic of my\
  \ very own self. This was an absolutely unplanned trip. For the first time in my\
  \ life, I decided to travel to an entirely new world which has culture, language,\
  \ and locality different than mine, without anybody dear to me.\n\n The first thing\
  \ I witnessed about Delhi is in the midst of hustling and bustling crowd, the Delhi\
  \ night sky seemed nonchalant whether people were stargazing it or not. We humans\
  \ have so many things common and one such thing is hope, hope to come across nicest\
  \ people in the journey called life. But Delhi city had stories of molestation,\
  \ a city during nights could scare any woman. But that didn\u2019t occur to me till\
  \ I landed.\n\nThe host looked like every other woman I saw in my life except that\
  \ this woman had a persona that very few can have. She looked kind yet powerful.\
  \ She had this warmth and after all, we were strangers to each other yet there was\
  \ this comfort we had in between us. As soon as I entered her home, she provided\
  \ a plate full of flatbread served with potato curry and kheer (Indian dessert).\
  \ Throughout my stay at her home which was for one week, she cooked delicious meals\
  \ and served them. \n\nAs I said, we wish to meet only good people on the journey,\
  \ I was lucky enough to meet only good people throughout my stay in Delhi. Like\
  \ the Ola driver who said he would be ready to help me whenever I visit Delhi, like\
  \ the foreigner who is from Brazil and who shared tons of stories about her personal\
  \ life and bid goodbye with a radiant smile, like the girl whom I met in the metro\
  \ train who helped me in understanding the metro map and like the uncle who held\
  \ my hand and showed me everything in Gurudwara. I guess this is what traveling\
  \ offers you. News channels, people from social media want us to believe that humanity\
  \ doesn\u2019t exist anymore, but as soon as one travels and meets the masses, one\
  \ can realize the world isn\u2019t bad. In fact, we can come across good every now\
  \ and then. And in order to come across abundantly, one should be kind enough too.\
  \ \n\nDelhi in a nutshell:\nMy first destination was The India Gate. As magnificent\
  \ it sounded, the architecture of this monument left me in awe. This beautiful triumphal\
  \ arc reminds about all those great Indian soldiers who lost their lives in World\
  \ war I.  But most of all, the interesting thing I came across was the people who\
  \ surrounded it. These are the people who perhaps belong to this city, yet every\
  \ day you would not come across the crowd decreasing. There were a lot of food stalls\
  \ selling pani puri, chat etc\u2026 And as I loved pani puris, I devoured a lot\
  \ of them.\nMy next stop was at Akshardham temple and as intriguing as the name\
  \ sounds, one can absolutely fall in love with the sculpting and art of the temple.\
  \ The temple looks as if it's playing an enchanting story of the Indian gods. With\
  \ Rajasthani pink sandstone and Italian Carrara marble, the entire temple looks\
  \ vibrant taking us to a spiritual world.\nI was lucky enough to go to Lotus temple,\
  \ Jantar Mantar, and Humayun's tomb in this brief period. The last three days, I\
  \ spent on visiting world culture festival hosted by the art of living. Nonetheless,\
  \ this journey taught me that there is a world, people, and hearts that could be\
  \ entirely different than what we imagine. The world which actually offers an inspiration\
  \ to help people irrespective of what culture they belong to or who they are."
