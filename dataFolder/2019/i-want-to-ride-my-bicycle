Text: "I\u2019m riding my bike in the middle of this tiny little town in the heart\
  \ of Burgundy and while the vineyards pass by like the perfect scenery for a cult\
  \ movie, I question myself about how the hell did I found this place. I have no\
  \ wine knowledge, zero money and a poor understanding of bicycles \u2013 which explains\
  \ why two minutes later I had to stop and ask someone how to turn on the lights.\
  \ Anyway, I was there, and I was living the dream: wind on my face, beautiful old\
  \ villages and that golden color of vine autumn leaves that will allow me to never\
  \ forget why the region is called C\xF4te D\u2019Or (golden coast). \nI was at the\
  \ \u201CRoute des Grands Crus\u201D, the home of 80% of the most expensive wines\
  \ in the world. Did you ever hear about the famous Roman\xE9e-Conti? Me neither,\
  \ but now we know that a bottle could cost half a million dollars as recently sold\
  \ in an auction by Sotheby\u2019s. That\u2019s the thing about wine knowledge: you\
  \ always think you need it until someone you know start making gurgling sounds while\
  \ drinking. It\u2019s supposed to be great but it\u2019s only strange. Half a million\
  \ dollars? Sorry people, I can\u2019t relate. The only reason I ended up in Dijon\
  \ was a master\u2019s degree in literature. Wine is a bonus. \nMy day had started\
  \ early in the morning. The \u201CRoute des Grands Crus\u201D goes from Dijon, burgundy\u2019\
  s capital, to Beaune. Since I was staying at an Airbnb in Dijon, I caught the regional\
  \ train to Beaune, so that I could make the bike route arriving back home at the\
  \ end of the trip. The TER\u2019s, as those trains are called, are pretty low cost\
  \ (6 to 10 euros) and the ticket allows you to bring your bike with no additional\
  \ taxes. 20 minutes of looking through the window and you arrive at this beautiful\
  \ city where you can enjoy a nice coffee in one of the terrasses of the Carnot square\
  \ while enjoying the sun. French people love the sun so if you have good weather\
  \ as I did that day you are in for some talk with the locals (if it\u2019s your\
  \ thing). After coffee, a visit to the Hospices de Beaune. A hospital foundation\
  \ from the middle ages, this beautiful building has an exemplary burgundy roof,\
  \ with its colorful glazed tiles making geometric patterns at three sides of the\
  \ yard. Still in Beaune, you can visit the Patriarch wine house and walk around\
  \ 5 km of vaulted galleries, some going back to the 13th century. A visit with tasting\
  \ costs 17euros per person and it\u2019s totally worth it. There was a wine-consulter\
  \ explaining the logic of the burgundy domaines and I have to say it was the first\
  \ time I understood what was written in the wine bottles in France! You see, in\
  \ burgundy you don\u2019t usually see the name of the grape in the label because\
  \ if you understand the domaines you will necessarily know what kind of grape they\
  \ work with. \nI was starting to worry about the time, so I bought a sandwich to\
  \ go at Bien et Bon, and true to its name it was good. I packed the remaining half\
  \ and started pedaling. The route isn\u2019t all the way flat and I\u2019m not exactly\
  \ in shape so sometimes I wondered why I was doing it. But it was so worth it. By\
  \ the time I had to stop and ask for help with my bike lights, I was arriving at\
  \ the Clos de Vougeot. The visual of this small castle with the fading afternoon\
  \ sun is one picture I shall remember forever. I sat on a low stone wall and ate\
  \ the last piece of my sandwich while that golden sea changed its color one last\
  \ time. Tired but with a smile, I left Vougeot to continue my way back. What an\
  \ amazing day. And I still had 20km to go. Let\u2019s start walking."
