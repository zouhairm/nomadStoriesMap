Text: "For the simple reason that it had been dubbed \u2018Singles Getaway\u2019 drew\
  \ my attention to the travel package. Not because I was looking to mingle but because\
  \ I thought it would be an enthusiast dream to travel with such kind of a group.\
  \ I didn\u2019t know what to expect but I was very open to anything. Honestly speaking,\
  \ I wanted to find out what \u2018singles\u2019 do when they get away.\nWe set out\
  \ for The Girrafe Ark-which is an idyllic holiday resort sitting on the Aberdare\
  \ Ranges in Nyeri County from Nairobi at exactly 7.30am. On a bus with a capacity\
  \ of 56 seats, I made out only five men as soon as I embarked. No worries. I took\
  \ it that men are not keen on road trips or solo travel which is as I would learn\
  \ much later, what this was, a solo travel package.\n\n\u201CThe word \u2018single\u2019\
  \ directed 99% of the clients towards mingling which is not necessarily the case,\u201D\
  \ said Robert Githire, the CEO of Elyzza Tours and Adventures.\n\nBack to the Ark\
  \ that despite its name didn\u2019t have any giraffes, you could read disappointment\
  \ in some of the ladies faces. The first activity for the day trip was team building\
  \ and some of the activities required for persons to pair up. Do you see where I\u2019\
  m heading with this?\n\nThe ages varied with the youngest being 23 and the oldest\
  \ being 40.\n\n\u201CI personally hoped I would meet someone who I would connect\
  \ with,\u201D lamented a young lady who did not wish to be named.\n\nFor Teresiah\
  \ Ndoro, another solo reveler in her late 20\u2019s, she wanted a trip out of town\
  \ with new people for a chance of networking.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve really enjoyed\
  \ myself. I will do this more often.\u201D She said.\nAccording to Githire, Singles\
  \ have always had a hard time vacationing. The typical \u201Csingle vacation\u201D\
  \ is portrayed to be a group of friends that ultimately turns into a booze fest,\
  \ or a solo vacation typically filled with a lot of reading and watching happy loving\
  \ couples frolic in the sand and surf.\n\n\u201CThe main reason why we started this\
  \ was because during tours most clients would ask, \u2018will I get bored if I come\
  \ alone?\u2019, and so we realized we need to give a chance to solo travelers who\
  \ won\u2019t feel out of place amidst couples and family members.\u201D He said\n\
  \nIn the past, the idea of women going on solo adventures was considered \u2018\
  brave\u2019, \u2018eccentric\u2019 or \u2018risky\u2019. But there has since been\
  \ a huge shift in attitude.\n\nFor those traveling solo by circumstance rather than\
  \ choice, there is a middle way. Small group package tours made up of strangers\
  \ are proving themselves popular.\nAfter a vigorous and engaging team building session,\
  \ we were then treated to a sumptuous buffet lunch after which persons were free\
  \ to socialize and network.\n\nThe hotel also offered numerous activities which\
  \ included horse riding, cycling, swimming among others. It also boasts of a giant\
  \ chess board on the ground which is mostly used for selfies as opposed to playing.\n\
  \nWe also took a tour around the expansive grounds with an able guide who would\
  \ show us some of their rooms which are extra ordinare per excellence. A standard\
  \ room, we would learn will dent you a cool sh. 16,000 while an executive room goes\
  \ for sh. 18, 000. A royal suite which is more spacious and with a balcony costs\
  \ sh. 26,000 while the presidential suite goes for sh. 36,000.\n\nBy the time it\
  \ got to 4 pm, people had loosened up and friendships were fast brewing.\n\nFor\
  \ Michael King\u2019ori and Hannah Musau, things were moving with a bit faster.\n\
  \n\u201CWe happened to sit together in the bus and we just started talking,\u201D\
  \ Michael tells me as we take a break from touring the rooms.\n\nHannah snuggles\
  \ next to him and tells me they already have a date the next day. You cannot ignore\
  \ their chemistry. It\u2019s not forced. Nothing gives away the fact that they just\
  \ met a few hours ago.\nShe\u2019s 24, a civil engineer, and he is 31, an architect.\
  \ We can only wait and see what they will build of the Nyeri tour."
