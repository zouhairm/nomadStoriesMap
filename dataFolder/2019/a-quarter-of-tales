Text: "In May 2018, I finally set foot in the French Quarter of New Orleans. A moment\
  \ I had been waiting for years, I could feel it all in the air as I began my first\
  \ excursion of those storied streets during that early May morning. The culture,\
  \ history, magic, ghosts, spirits, music and food; all of it began in those streets.\n\
  \tIt was six o\u2019clock in the morning, so the Vieux Carre as it\u2019s called\
  \ by some was still resting from the parties of the evening before; this in turn\
  \ allowed me to see the Quarter\u2019s most authentic face. Its aging Spanish Colonial\
  \ architecture; worn around the edges, but ultimately preserved, protected and respected.\
  \ Colorful beads idly hanging from gas lamps that date back to the late 19th-century.\
  \ Jaded residents, having their morning smoke and coffee while resting upon their\
  \ galleries; each of which clad in fanciful ironwork. Not even the sewer\u2019s\
  \ pungent odor could sway me from the stories; of which there were plenty.\n\tAt\
  \ the corner of Royal and Iberville stood Hotel Monteleone; the Quarter\u2019s lone\
  \ skyscraper, it is a vestige of a time before a dedicated and persistent historical\
  \ society known as the Vieux Carre Commission gained a foothold on the area. Further\
  \ down Royal, at Governor Nicholls, one will bear witness to the ill-famed former\
  \ mansion of Delphine LaLaurie; my heart racing as I can feel the screams and cries\
  \ of the poor slaves who had to endure her barbaric torture. Down Orleans Street\
  \ towards Bourbon, I looked upon the balcony of the Bourbon Orleans Hotel; alleged\
  \ location of the famed quadroon balls, I couldn\u2019t help but to imagine seeing\
  \ Creole women of color in 19th-century dresses making arrangements of placage with\
  \ their wealthy French paramours. \n\tEverywhere I looked, there was another story.\
  \ It may have been 2018, but I felt as if I was walking through a warp in time.\
  \ I was uneasy with such a thought; after all, a person with my complexion would\
  \ not have been safe wandering such streets aimlessly back in the 1830\u2019s, but\
  \ the spirits were there to protect me. I could feel their warmth and joy with each\
  \ step I took whilst actively looking for their histories. As the day went on, in\
  \ the distance, I could hear the sound of trumpets, trombones and tubas being loudly\
  \ played. I inched closer to Jackson Square and tapped my toes to the sounds of\
  \ the brass band. \n\tThe tunes of the second line complimented the air surrounding\
  \ Jackson Square. As they loudly, and ironically, played in front of a \u201CChurch\
  \ Quiet Zone\u201D sign, I eyed the Pontalba Buildings; once serving as the homes\
  \ of New Orleans 19th-century bourgeoisie, the ghosts of which looking down upon\
  \ the scene with either disdain or curiosity. The band played on the heels of the\
  \ storied St. Louis Cathedral, a sacred house that has also been an audience to\
  \ gruesome sights such as the rotting corpses of men who dared to rebel against\
  \ Spanish rule and the severed heads of unruly slaves adorning the now well-manicured\
  \ and neatly maintained gardens of Jackson Square.\n\tNew Orleans often did feel\
  \ like a city of contradictions and ironies, and the place where it was most evident\
  \ was the French Quarter. Stories of slavery, segregation and mistreatment of black\
  \ people were interwoven amidst the plethora of black-owned establishments. A Catholic\
  \ cathedral surrounded by daiquiri bars, strip clubs, fortune tellers and Voodoo\
  \ shops. Families taking historical tours across the street from loud, rowdy and\
  \ drunk members of fraternities and sororities at nearby colleges. Conflicting images\
  \ were always juxtaposed beside one another, and yet there was never a moment when\
  \ any of it felt wrong. \n\tOne morning wasn\u2019t even close to enough time to\
  \ take in all of the stories told by the French Quarter. Not even the week-long\
  \ duration of my trip was enough time. As a passionate author, just the scenery\
  \ was enough to inspire me to weave intricate stories of my own. The French Quarter\
  \ tells a story like no other, as does the city of New Orleans itself. It has been\
  \ one year since my trip, and I am quite eager to return soon."
