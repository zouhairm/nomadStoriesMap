Text: "Very early in the morning of International Women\u2019s Day March 2019 I arrived\
  \ at a small convent in Puebla, Mexico where I was greeted with open arms by my\
  \ aunt and six of her fellow sisters; the congregation of the Charity of the Sisters\
  \ of Saint-Louis. As I arrive at the pink gated home, the 3D art work of the Virgin\
  \ of Guadeloupe framed on the house is surrounded by 3 flowers symbolizing the union\
  \ of 3 cultures; the fleur-de-lys and the maple leaf representing Quebec and Canada\
  \ where the first nuns came from and the calla lily representing Mexican culture\
  \ and the novice nuns that join this congregation. The home is welcoming, peaceful\
  \ and minimalist in its presentation. The art and words that decorate the walls\
  \ reflect the different saints and prayers that are important to them. Everything\
  \ in the house is a reflection of their faith. \n\nI was surprised by the dichotomy\
  \ that I was about to experience; one of unconditional faith supported by daily\
  \ practices of prayer and attending mass versus one of laughter, song and joy entrenched\
  \ in this strong sisterhood. \n\nAppropriately marked by International Women\u2019\
  s Day, I was met with strong women who live in community with each other honoring\
  \ their vows of obedience, chastity and poverty. They, of all the women I know,\
  \ chose a life that least conforms to society. They detach themselves from all temptations\
  \ (hair, fashion, music, alcohol) to remain close and true to their faith. \n\n\
  Every day they attend mass either in the morning or in the evening. Every day, each\
  \ nun has a task in the community to help a person: either to receive communion,\
  \ to listen as a person tackles a difficulty in their life, to support the aging\
  \ and ill, to lead a group of women in their personal life journey, to teach children\
  \ about welcoming faith into their lives, or to teach adults to help support communities\
  \ further away in their upcoming celebrations of the week leading to Easter Sunday.\
  \ Every day these women are constantly at work supporting, preparing to support\
  \ or engaged in their daily prayer.\n\nMy favorite time of the day is 6 pm. At this\
  \ precise time every day they gather in their small chapel upstairs. I quietly open\
  \ my door to hear them pray in unison and sing hymns that make them sound angelic\
  \ in nature. Their voices are sincere and filled with belief in the lyrics they\
  \ sing. It is reminiscent of the hymns you hear while visiting the many churches\
  \ of Puebla. While this daily prayer ritual happens, the house is in the state of\
  \ quiet that I initially expected from a community of nuns.  \n\nEvery woman has\
  \ come to this place in her own time and in her own way, but each is confident in\
  \ the calling they have received to this life and mission. Communal living has both\
  \ its difficulties and its strengths. Living together in respect and harmony is\
  \ learned and requires conscious actions, but my observation is that the aspect\
  \ of community is their strength. They gather daily for breaks and meals. This time\
  \ is an opportunity to share in conversation about the daily events or, at times,\
  \ in deeper reflection. To my pleasant surprise, this time is often filled with\
  \ laughter and joking between the sisters. There is a camaraderie that supports\
  \ each woman, especially novice nuns upon entering the congregation, to learn and\
  \ grow in their devotion.  From the outside, their faith is almost beyond comprehension\
  \ to someone like me. How rare is it to encounter a person, let alone a group of\
  \ women who appear to have no doubts in their life path? The secret is this: every\
  \ day is a choice and every action is a choice. Daily practices and community are\
  \ the strength to upholding the choice they made when reciting their vows. \n\n\
  I leave this place of compassion with nothing but respect and gratitude for these\
  \ strong women, including my aunt, who are completely devoted to the love they have\
  \ for God and their calling to help others."
