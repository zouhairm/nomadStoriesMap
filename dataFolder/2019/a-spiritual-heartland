Text: "From here I can see the ominous peaks of the Cordillera Apolobamba etch a rough\
  \ border around the moist valley below. Creamy, lush fog pours through with a delicate\
  \ but heavy motion, tempting a feeling that everything is alive and animated. A\
  \ cool sunset illuminates silvery wisps of clouds that coil playfully around the\
  \ tall peaks. The dense fog transforms in front me as a waning sun sends shards\
  \ of light to touch every last molecule in an oscillating rhythm, exposing incredible\
  \ textures with blue and grey hues. When the light hits the fog, a stunning, iridescent\
  \ white surface glows before folding under the darkness of shadow again, in a constantly\
  \ churning sea. I barely blink, because I am afraid of forgetting this heavenly\
  \ moment, watching the sunset in the Cordillera Apolobamba region of Bolivia; in\
  \ solitude, but never truly alone. \n\n        The locals call this a spiritual\
  \ heartland. Never in my imagination would I have a spiritual experience, but my\
  \ time trekking in Bolivia comes very close. Before finding myself camping in a\
  \ remote part of Northern Bolivia, I travelled a long and bumpy road from the capital\
  \ city, La Paz, to a village I read about named Pelechuco. Leaving La Paz, it was\
  \ surreal to watch the hectic urban sprawl give way to the altiplano, a high desert-like\
  \ region that boasts the majestic and mythical Andes mountain range. Travelling\
  \ by local bus, I made my way to this remote village, along with a cluster of locals\
  \ speaking mostly a Native language called Aymara. As folk music blared through\
  \ the speakers, people came and went along the 9-hour journey, sitting wherever\
  \ there happened to be space even if that meant on the lap of another traveller.\
  \ Quickly realizing they did not share a similar sense of personal boundaries, as\
  \ I am accustomed to, I embraced the moment an elderly woman sat on my lap, flashing\
  \ me a smile with several gold teeth glistening in the harsh sun. Time passed effortlessly\
  \ on the ride, as I was locked to the window, taking in the breathless scenery of\
  \ snow capped mountain peaks and vast fields of soft marsh land, with elegant teal\
  \ hills of grasses and flowers, where llamas grazed and looked up with flirtatious\
  \ eyes. The climax of the journey reached a high altitude where barely anything\
  \ grew, and the bus descended down hairpin turns until, just like that, we landed\
  \ in Pelechucho, the final stop. \n\t\n\tA quaint and picturesque village, Pelechuco\
  \ is divided by a boisterous river that shares its name, and was my gateway into\
  \ the Cordillera Apolobamba. I hired a local guide through the only operating hotel,\
  \ where I was the only guest, and began organizing plans to hike 5-days to a village\
  \ called Curva. As I began the journey the next day with my guide, he led me up\
  \ the twisting cobble stone streets higher and higher, until the respite and quietude\
  \ of village life slowly disappeared behind us. Along the way, perfectly intact\
  \ Inca homes sat invitingly, sparking my imagination for the life that existed there\
  \ at one time. We kept walking until we passed through the threshold of a thickening\
  \ fog, coming up a steep pass onto the moist ground that became our first campsite.\
  \ My guide, an amiable man with leathery burgundy skin, made his way back down the\
  \ path to sleep, leaving me in my state of bewilderment. His footsteps faded and\
  \ the mellifluous sounds of nature completely enveloped my senses. When the sun\
  \ began to tilt towards the horizon, I climbed up to the highest point I could reach\
  \ within reasonable distance, and found myself at the most incredible view, watching\
  \ in awe as the fog we had pushed ourselves through in that final leg of the day\u2019\
  s hike churned below me in a giant bowl. The mountain peaks stood defiantly, and\
  \ I breathed in with vigor, filled to the brim with the powerful culture, geography,\
  \ and spirit of Bolivia, knowing that this was just the first night to an incredible\
  \ trek, a close encounter with the spiritual heartland."
