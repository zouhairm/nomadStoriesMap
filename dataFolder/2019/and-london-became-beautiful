Text: "It had been 9 months and 1 day since my mum died. A full gestation period of\
  \ anxiety, grief, depression and the pressure to fulfill a role I never could. When\
  \ people gave me what I called the \"sympathy eyes\" I would use this trip as a\
  \ card trick, laying down all the cards on the table in a dramatic Royal Flush.\
  \ It was, in some ways, the trip of a lifetime. A full month of overseas travel\
  \ to Europe, my entire life folded carefully into a turquoise suitcase and disappearing\
  \ onto the next flight from Sydney Australia, to Heathrow in London.\n\nThe concern\
  \ on my Dad's face was etched deep. I had been 'fine' for 9 months and 1 day and\
  \ without a family nucleus surrounding me, he was certain of my collapse. Not that\
  \ he said anything though - How could he? And would I have listened if he had? \n\
  \n\"I love you. Be safe\" He says after minutes of long hugging. I remember searching\
  \ his eyes for tears, as a beacon of emotion, but there weren't any. My mind drew\
  \ the immediate comparison, 'Mum would have cried'. I carefully shove that thought\
  \ into a suitcase of trauma that would remain sealed for another 3 years. My dad\
  \ was already walking out of the airport.\n\n---------------\n\nLondon was magical.\
  \ As a child, London appeared to me like a dream of history and people that would\
  \ immediately open their arms to me and accept me as their own. Those days shortly\
  \ before I stepped on that plane I would dream of London and what it would hold\
  \ for me. In my mind, the sky was always a clear deep blue, the streets were friendly\
  \ and peaceful and I would wander aimlessly with the intention of getting lost and\
  \ finding something I had never seen before.\n\nBut that's not what happened. \n\
  \nI followed the belt around and around at Heathrow airport, looking for that turquoise\
  \ suitcase. But it didn't appear. How could it when it had been left in Bangkok?\n\
  \nBustled onto the Tube we were met with derision. Aussie travelers thinking they\
  \ owned the place with their suitcases blocking the path and their butchering of\
  \ the English language. I looked at the sky, the one I had dreamt about. It was\
  \ cloudy and dark. The sun would not be up for another 4 hours.\n\nAs the days ticked\
  \ by, I began to see the sky as \"Not Australian\". It was like a tea where the\
  \ bag had been thrown out before mixing. Australia's sky was rich and blue and powerful,\
  \ a tea taken black with no milk. As I desperately missed my home, all I could think\
  \ was, where was the London I had dreamed of? \n\nIt was not until 9 months and\
  \ 29 days after my mum died that I saw the London I expected. It was a bar for travelers\
  \ where pints and pizza and stories were on the menu. The remaining group from my\
  \ tour sat around a wooden table, laughing and shouting, drinking and singing. Outside\
  \ was cold, I was wearing two pairs of jeans, but inside seemed to emanate with\
  \ a warm glow that can only be described as homely. I smiled and drank with the\
  \ rest of them. And London became beautiful to me. There was only a black sky above\
  \ and the sound of ambulances and cars outside. Inside smelt like beer and pizza\
  \ and everything was sticky. But this feeling was the London I wanted. The feeling\
  \ of connection to people who didn't know it had been 9 months and 29 days since\
  \ Mum died - Or knew and didn't attempt to 'make it better'. I was no longer playing\
  \ cards and throwing my trip on the table triumphantly to protect myself from sadness.\
  \ There was no sadness. There was only a sticky wooden table, covered in pizza and\
  \ pints and a group of people who only knew that right then and there they were\
  \ happy. \n\nIn the morning, I would take my turquoise suitcase with my life folded\
  \ up inside and would travel home. Back to an Australian sky. It would be time to\
  \ miss a London sky for a little while."
