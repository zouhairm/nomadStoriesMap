Text: "Panic permeates on the end of a late afternoon sunbeam. The sun\u2019s light\
  \ is just strong enough to pierce the canopy of this thick faerie forest. I could\
  \ certainly use some faerie magic right now, to conjure clarity and a way through\
  \ this maze of mountain beech. I\u2019m rapidly running out of water. And daylight.\
  \ \n\tLeaves smother my face. Branches poke me from all angles. \n\tThrough a rare\
  \ gap in the foliage, I spot the towering buttress of the Dragons Teeth \u2013 a\
  \ prominent mountain in New Zealand\u2019s Douglas Range in Kahurangi National Park.\
  \ Apparently there\u2019s a ragged route through here demarcated by sporadically\
  \ strewn stacks of rock cairns. But it\u2019s been over an hour since I last saw\
  \ one. So I set a compass bearing to southwest, towards the mighty buttress. There\u2019\
  s nothing left do except plunge right in.\nI\u2019m on an 11-day solo wilderness\
  \ hike. It\u2019s turning out to be a rite of passage, a navigation of both internal\
  \ and external terrain. \n\tI need to go down to get up, so I slide down mossy chutes\
  \ on my backside. I can hear a river below. Or is it just the wind? \n\tI reach\
  \ for my map to check, but it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s bloody well gone!\n\tPanic\
  \ chases on the end of a late afternoon sunbeam. \n\tI look behind me. Where have\
  \ I come from? I\u2019ve been sliding at random and it all looks the same.\n\tI\
  \ backtrack. Curse. Clamber. Swear. Scratch my head furiously.\n\tTen minutes pass.\
  \ No map.\n\tI\u2019ve got this.\n\tFifteen minutes elapse. Prolapse. Anxiety\u2019\
  s boiling.\n\tI put my hands in prayer position. \u201CIf there are any benevolent\
  \ beings with me,\u201D I say out loud, in desperation. \u201CThen show me the map.\
  \ Now!\u201D\n\tAnd I kid you not, at that exact moment I spot it.\n\tThe swearing\
  \ and ranting stops. This is a massive let-off. A stern warning to just slow down\
  \ and pay attention.\nThe trees relent and I see what looks like a flattish campsite\
  \ by a river. I refill my bottle, and am just about to set up camp when I see cairns.\
  \ I\u2019m suddenly back on the \u201Cpath\u201D.\n        This becomes the cycle\
  \ for the next 11 days: Lose path, scout aimlessly, set a compass bearing, bush\
  \ bash, and then, when I\u2019ve given up on finding the track it reappears.\n \
  \       I scramble out of the dragon\u2019s mouth.\n        I climb waterfalls,\
  \ giant\u2019s causeways, when the bush gets too thick. \n        I follow animal\
  \ trails.\n        I listen to the distant echo of bird calls ricocheting off nocturnal\
  \ valley walls.  \n        I weave through the saddle of the Needle\u2019s Eye,\
  \ stumble past the Drunken Sailors. I bathe in Lonely Lake and feel part of everything.\
  \ I wild-camp on ridge tops beneath moon and stars. I watch morning mist hover above\
  \ Boulder Lake. Branches draw blood. One lashes me across the eyeball and I have\
  \ blurry vision for the rest of the day. Another whips my mouth during an uncontrolled\
  \ slide down a mossy waterfall. \n        I may be in the bowels of branch-snapping\
  \ bastardry, but I end up in places few people would have ever contemplated their\
  \ existence while frantically chewing dried mangoes.\n\tSome days, my walking speed\
  \ is less than 500 metres per hour.\n\tSuch wild disorientation is reactivating\
  \ a survival gene, a forgotten sense stifled by everyday convenience. The further\
  \ I walk through these mountains, the more I begin to feel their power saturating\
  \ every cell. \n        It\u2019s eight days before I see people, two brothers aged\
  \ 71 and 68. They\u2019ve just completed an arduous seven-hour ridge walk. Their\
  \ buoyancy and vigour is inspiring.\n        The weather is good yet again, so I\
  \ spend my last night on the range camping on a ridge top. Serenity saunters on\
  \ the end of a late afternoon sunbeam. \n        Sitting in a mystic arena of rocky\
  \ cathedrals, each mountain summit a holy pinnacle, is like I\u2019m awakening in\
  \ my own Dreamtime. Every footstep is writing a line in my personal mythology. While\
  \ I haven\u2019t slayed any dragons, the intention here was never to conquer peaks;\
  \ it was to align with the forgotten wildness of my soul and see that reflected\
  \ back as only Nature can. \n        It\u2019s safe to say that the dragon roars\
  \ on."
