Text: "It\u2019s a cold morning at Playa Altamira, in the Mexican Pacific. No gulls\
  \ are singing. A small fire is awaiting all walkers who can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019\
  t even believe I\u2019m here. Seems to me that I\u2019m the least prepared to the\
  \ adventure: everyone has special walking shoes, sticks, water backpacks. As for\
  \ me, only wearing a huichol morral filled with a banana and some sunflower seeds.\
  \ But the event is not meant as a race. It is is more than that.\n\nLet me explain\
  \ what this event is all about. It is a three days walking through the Cirios Valley,\
  \ a sanctuary in Baja California. We start at Playa Altamira, in the Mexican Pacific\
  \ and walk 50 kilometers followed by 60 kilometers the next two days until we end\
  \ at Bahia de los Angeles, at the Sea of Cortez. It doesn\u2019t sound easy. Believe\
  \ me when I say that it is much worse and more beautiful than what I ever expected.\n\
  \nThis journey is well organized by Adixion Tours, a Mexican company dedicated to\
  \ adventure tourism.  Once you are at Playa Altamira, you only need to worry about\
  \ your own journey. Transportation, food, medical services and shelter are wholly\
  \ covered.\n\nWe started the hardest day with a small ritual in the cold waters\
  \ of the Pacific 0cean. Step by step for 50 kilometers up to Mission of San Borja,\
  \ inside the natural sanctuary.\n\nOnce you realize that the sun and the geography\
  \ won\u2019t be your allies, ironically the beauty of this majestic desert shocks\
  \ you. Filled up with saguaros, biznagas, ocotillos and cirios. Looks more like\
  \ a desert forest to me!\n\nEvery five kilometers waits a pit stop from Adixion\
  \ Tours with water and medical support if needed. Fruit and some snacks beneath\
  \ a shade is all what\u2019s needed to gain some energy and continue the journey.\n\
  \nAs I wrote you before, this isn\u2019t a race, even though many train to improve\
  \ upon their last score. It\u2019s more like a spiritual journey because pain is\
  \ present during the journey, a whole lot of pain. Foot pain. Knee pain. Sun burn.\
  \  Emotional pain is the worst of all. But there is something hidden in the pain.\
  \ It is such a liberating power. \n\nMany cultures around the world use pain rituals\
  \ to evolve. How was I to know that I was immersing in these ritual. All that pain\
  \ was hidden under my skin, under my heart. And as pain grew in intensity, so did\
  \ my vision; I started seeing all that beauty untouched by humankind.\n\nFraternity\
  \ between the participants is another gift from this adventure.  When you walk for\
  \ 5 hours unstopped, sometimes silence can be kind of cruel. So eventually you just\
  \ get along with a walker. And chat just starts; a new friendship is made in the\
  \ middle of the desert. It doesn\u2019t matter age, sex, or profession. We are there,\
  \ walking until we reach the goal: Bahia de Los Angeles.\n\nSo thanks to friendship\
  \ is that we help each other. We share tips, anecdotes, strength, and surely a tear\
  \ or two. I met a woman with cancer. Walked side by side with a man that lost his\
  \ knee in a sport accident. A girl that survived a terrible car accident. A young\
  \ guy who confessed to me that depression pushed him to think of suicide as a way\
  \ out. But there, we were all alive, unbreakable. \n\nDuring my journey I thought\
  \ about everything and about nothing. Saw the moon and heard the silence singing.\
  \ Danced over the cricket\u2019s party. Saluted three coyotes running. I stared\
  \ at the sun without complaint. Once full of pain, I now felt free.\n\nThe second\
  \ night we stayed at Agua de Higuera. Only 30 kilometers were between us and the\
  \ finish line.  And even though the body is tired, you just know you can\u2019t\
  \ stop. You are just too near the finish line. But you walk, stronger than ever,\
  \ and when you think you will die of pain, you see the blue sea. A few more steps\
  \ to touch the warm sea of Cortez. Surely some tears will join the ocean, for you\u2019\
  ve finished your journey: coast-to-coast across Baja California."
