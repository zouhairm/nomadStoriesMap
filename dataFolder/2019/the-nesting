Text: "On a humid and cloudy night, we wonder the pitch-black beach of Camaronal Wildlife\
  \ Refuge in search of nesting sea turtles. My friend and I are looking for zipper-shaped\
  \ tracks in the sand. Our only light source is the red bulb flashlight carried by\
  \ our guide Bryan, a young local man with dark hair and a bright smile. After a\
  \ long and bumpy ride to get here (a.k.a. the \u201CCosta Rican massage\u201D),\
  \ I\u2019m glad the summer rain is holding off. \n\nWe hoped to observe the famous\
  \ arribada, Spanish for \u201Carrival\u201D \u2013 a mass nesting event where sea\
  \ turtles congregate in the thousands to lay their eggs. Instead the beach is deserted\
  \ and serene, the only sounds are the ocean's waves and Bryan\u2019s soft voice.\
  \ He alternates between sharing turtle trivia and playing phone-tag with another\
  \ guide for news of a sighting. \n\nNavigating the driftwood in the dark makes for\
  \ slow going. Sand and debris collect in my sandals, so I ditch them. I scratch\
  \ my shins, itchy from the bug bites I\u2019ve accumulated this week, certain that\
  \ our trek is adding more. My shirt is now sticking to my skin and I begin to doubt\
  \ we\u2019ll see what we came for.\n\nThen Bryan gets the call. The other tour group\
  \ has spotted an Olive Ridley turtle coming up out of the water. We catch up to\
  \ them. About 2 ft long, she\u2019s already picked a nesting spot. \n\nWe huddle\
  \ behind her, transfixed. She is moving dry surface sand out of her way. Then with\
  \ her rear flippers she scoops the moist sand underneath and flicks it outwards\
  \ to create an egg chamber, alternating flippers like scaly spatulas. Moments later,\
  \ eggs are flying out too. She\u2019s digging up an existing nest! We learn this\
  \ disturbance renders the whole clutch unviable. The mood turns solemn as Bryan\
  \ hands us a discarded egg to hold. It feels soft and malleable.\n\nThe mama stops\
  \ digging, as if acknowledging her transgression. She heaves her body a short distance\
  \ from the original pit and starts over. This time the sand is vacant. Once the\
  \ new cavity for her clutch is complete, the flippers grow still and she begins\
  \ releasing her eggs. They drop 2-3 at a time like perfect, shiny ping-pong balls\
  \ with trailing mucus. It\u2019s precious and primal.\n\nAfter the last of the 100\
  \ plus eggs are dropped, she fills the chamber with sand, packing it down with her\
  \ back flippers and then with her body by rocking back and forth. More shuffling\
  \ of surface sand to disguise the nest. Finished. She slowly scoots back to the\
  \ water\u2019s edge and disappears into the surf. We\u2019re all in awe of her work.\
  \ It feels surreal and magical to have observed such a laborious process for a creature\
  \ rarely on land. \n\nBut the magic doesn\u2019t stop there; as an unexpected treat\
  \ we get to time travel. The refuge\u2019s turtle hatchery is releasing their hatchlings\
  \ tonight and Bryan had arranged for them to wait for us.\n\nBuckets of tiny, black\
  \ turtles clambering on top of each other greet us at the hatchery\u2019s entrance.\
  \ We gather behind a line in the sand parallel to the water and the hatchlings are\
  \ gently dumped out on the opposite side. Flashlights are held up to imitate the\
  \ moon and guide them to the ocean. They make a floppy dash for it. Bryan becomes\
  \ like the rest of us, excitedly recording the spectacle with his phone. I grin\
  \ as I watch hundreds of baby turtles scuttle towards the sea, propelling themselves\
  \ forward as if already swimming. \n\nOnly one in 1,000 hatchlings are expected\
  \ to grow to maturity, yet I can\u2019t help but root for every single one of them\
  \ to make it. For the females to return to this very beach in fifteen years\u2019\
  \ time to make their own nests and for others to marvel at them as we did. Having\
  \ witnessed Costa Rica\u2019s conservation efforts and the passion of the people\
  \ who steward these incredible creatures, I know my hope is not in vain."
