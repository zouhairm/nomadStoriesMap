  \ (*CS - COUCHSURFING.ORG - an international travel guest website) - may be - it\
  \ is better to write about it in CS communities. Please - read careful my text about\
  \ what happened- dont post just now any were - i want listen your opinion - as expierienced\
  \ Coushsurfer - ok?\n\n29.07.2012, 19:16\n\nOh yes, write Contact Us\nplease - read\
  \ careful my text about what happened- dont post just now any were - i want listen\
  \ your opinion - as expierienced Coushsurfer - ok?\nOkay,\nI take guests through\
  \ the website couchsurfing.org for five years \u2013 from 2007 - and is best known\
  \ \u0441ouchserfer in southern Russia - I help for about 90 travelers, half of them\
  \ spent the night at my house. The region in which I live - Dagestan \u2013 the\
  \ most southern province of Russia - Republic with its ancient traditions and certain\
  \ norms of behavior. Currently, there complicated criminal situation, and the foreigners\
  \ here - rare. Safety of guests - most importantly for me - unfortunately, not all\
  \ of them understand it.\nThese guys \u2013 Don K. Cag - (Krakow, Poland - Georgia)\
  \ -http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/dkc/ -     and Kat  P. (Boston, Massachusetts,\
  \ USA) - http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/keti.paradis/  - were rude and alcoholics,\
  \ ungrateful, nervous, unstable people.\n I received them on Saturday, July 21,\
  \ introduced them to my friends and neighbors treated Dagestani national dishes.\
  \ I had them until Tuesday, July 24. On Tuesday they went to my friend in the village\
  \ Gunib - spent two days there. On Thursday, they stayed in the village Gunib (157\
  \ km from Makhachkala) - there was an agreement - that they will come in at 12-00\
  \  to village Kumukh (if they are left in the morning - that would be reached in\
  \ 1 hour by bus, the distance between Kumukh and  Gunib is only 50 km),  where I\
  \ was supposed to meet them and drive to a neighboring village to visit my relatives.\
  \ When I was invited to call and pick them up from there - Don crudely hung up phone.\
  \ He did not explain clearly the reason for my delay in Gunib village- such was\
  \ his gratitude for my concern for his safety ...\nNevertheless, I went with his\
  \ uncle in his car and took them away. In Kumukh we visited my uncle sclassmate\
  \  - Kat was aggressive and rude to yell at me \u2013 shut up - when I began to\
  \ ask about the reasons for their delay.\nI reassured her, made her walk  around\
  \ Kumukh village. Then we went to Shovkra \u2013 my native village - there  drunk\
  \ Don was offended by my joke about their appearance - they somehow got dressed\
  \ somehow Caucasian - Don grew a beard, Katie wore a headscarf - even though none\
  \ of my guests to dress this way is not. Don was rude to me - I asked him not to\
  \ worry and get to fresh air - but he escaped to a rural garden, and we with her\
  \ uncle had great difficulty to get it back.\nAfter the incident, the uncle invited\
  \ all to unwind and go to the mountain - the guys bought beer - they have abused\
  \ alcohol in Makhachkala even though I asked them not to drink a lot. On the mountain\
  \ I thought I show them a look and come back early - it was already midnight, my\
  \ wife's uncle was worried about us.\nMy uncle got drunk with the guests - and it\
  \ was difficult to talk. I began to ask Don and Kat persuade him to sit in the car\
  \ - for our common security and for the sake of his family - because his wife was\
  \ worried about him - excessive alcohol can lead to their marital conflict. However,\
  \ neither Don, nor Kat did not respond to my requests to stop drinking and get into\
  \ the car by the seat back and help his uncle.\nMoreover - Kat was rude to me screaming\
  \ \u2013 she said -  my uncle family problems do not relate to her, and she liked\
  \ sitting here (on the mountain) and drink beer.\nI was afraid that drunk uncle\
  \ can beat the machine - because the road to the mountain was pretty cool - but\
  \ only after my uncle shouts and visitors responded and returned to the village.\n\
  I'm sorry that happened after my guests took offense at me and did not realize -\
  \ I'm just concerned about our common security - if they all broke out there on\
  \ the mountain, Ii should be awful for my couchsurfing future. Even more offensive\
  \ to me that the next two days in the village of my guests had my uncle, abusing\
  \ alcohol - and did not answered my phone calls. Returned to the city they have\
  \ just two days later and wrote me a sms - asking them to return the bag with the\
  \ things left in my apartment in Makhachkala.\nI wrote to them that they can pick\
  \ up a bag at 11 o'clock in the morning - but, and this time they were late - and\
  \ took his bag, only about 12 pm on Sunday.\nI should add - that all this time in\
  \ the village, they were drinking with random people - and even spent a night outside\
  \ the house of my uncle - who knows where.\nI'm sorry - that they never tried to\
  \ contact me - or at least apologize to discuss their behavior. I'm curious - what\
  \ would have happened to me, if I had a so-carried to the United States or Poland\
  \ ... I note that I previously took about 10 travellers from Poland - and with none\
  \ of these problems have been encountered. As far as American - it was my first\
  \ and, unfortunately, led here to be a typical Yankee - stubborn, too arrogant and\
  \ insolent.\n\n-have you received my message?\n\n-Yes now reading\n-i want only\
  \ listen your opinion. They were quite rude\nyes.i am in great depression. i am\
  \ shoked. I am so sorry to hear\nIt must have been more terrible in real life\n\
  kat was new in CS - but Don registered 6 years ago - but both was awful\nguests...\n\
  thank you for listening me\n\n-from several days - i want to post this text every\
  \ there in CS communities and like a reference to this persons\nevery body must\
  \ learn about their dagestan journey - ok?\n\n2012"
