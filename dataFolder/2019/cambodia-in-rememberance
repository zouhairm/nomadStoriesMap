Text: "I woke up that day like it was any other in Phnom Penh. I showered and went\
  \ downstairs to the hostel dining area and ordered some coffee. I sat down, lit\
  \ a cigarette and started scrolling through websites on my phone, trying to find\
  \ something to do that day that would keep me in the city\u2026 if not it I would\
  \ be buying a bus ticket and heading to the next place that fell in my lap. Not\
  \ too long after the coffee arrived my friend Carlotta, who I just spent the last\
  \ three weeks with volunteering in a village in Cambodia, came downstairs and sat\
  \ across from me. I asked her if she had anything planned for the day, trying to\
  \ look for recommendations. She told me that she had heard about the killing fields\
  \ that were left by the Khmer Rouge.\nThe Khmer Rouge. Before I came to Cambodia\
  \ I had never heard about the regime or the horrible genocide that occurred in this\
  \ country forty years ago. I first heard about it when a tuk tuk driver I hired\
  \ to drive me to Angkar Wat took me to his village to eat snake soup at a local\
  \ \u2018restaurant\u2019 with him. He told me that the Khmer Rouge was a very bad\
  \ government and that a third of the country was killed during the four year reign.\
  \ He told me that his older brothers, his uncle, his father, and his grandfather\
  \ were all killed when he was a child.\nI asked Carlotta if she would mind if I\
  \ joined her as I didn\u2019t have anything else to do that day. So after we finished\
  \ our morning drop over coffee we jumped in a tuk tuk and after about an hour long\
  \ drive with a few other travelers that joined us at the hostel we arrived outside\
  \ of the killing fields. When we went up to the ticket booth we all opted to get\
  \ the audio tour so that we could find out some more history about what exactly\
  \ happened in the beautiful country. All of us, at first, started walking together\
  \ but soon we all started to drift off alone. Once the audio started we all heard\
  \ the most horrific stories about the torture and death that was inflicted on the\
  \ Cambodian people. It overwhelmed you with shock and horror and bewilderment that\
  \ this could happen. Along the walk and the audio tour I saw deep impressions in\
  \ the ground where there had been mass graves. In these pits bones and pieces of\
  \ torn clothing still seep to the surface.\nOne of the most memorable spots in this\
  \ killing field was a tree. This tree had a large, dark stain on it. It didn\u2019\
  t take long to start to weep over what had happened here, something so barbarous\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t imagine or would want this to happen to my worst enemy. Children\
  \ and babies were taken by their ankles and swung against the tree to smash their\
  \ skulls in, often in front of their mothers and family. There are no words to describe\
  \ the moment you witness the aftermath of such an event, I couldn\u2019t imagine\
  \ what it was like to experience it.\nOn the tuk tuk ride back to the hostel I started\
  \ talking to a girl, who had just walked through the killing fields with us, about\
  \ the horror of what we witnessed. We talked about humanity and how there isn\u2019\
  t enough of it left in this world. When we got back to the hostel my new friend\
  \ and I decided that we should see the infamous S-21 prison as well. This place\
  \ was just as shocking, if not more than the last.\nS-21 was a school before the\
  \ Khmer Rouge took control of Cambodia and was converted into a prison. Of the 14,000\
  \ people that were sent to S-21 only 7 survived. Pol Pot grew increasingly paranoid\
  \ and believed that it is better to kill innocent people than to risk letting a\
  \ guilty person go. Here you witness the pictures of grotesque bodies that were\
  \ found at this ruin, nothing is censored. Their bodies are mangled and bloodied.\
  \ Starving and naked. In one room there was a metal bed-frame that had indentions\
  \ in it. The audio tape revealed that people had been beaten so hard against this\
  \ frame that the metal bent beneath their bodies.\nIn the courtyard two large post\
  \ with a cross beam at the top was used to hang prisons up by their wrist, while\
  \ they were tied behind their backs above their heads. Men would pass out from the\
  \ pain they experienced from this and they would be revived by guards dunking their\
  \ heads in barrels of feces and water. In the old classrooms there were small cinder\
  \ block cells made that would hold so many people that they would be on top of each\
  \ other and could not lay down. Walking through these rooms that have next to no\
  \ light, with these cells lining the walls felt haunted. Just to imagine that hundreds\
  \ of people were kept in here, tortured, starved, humiliated, all of them innocent.\
  \ You could feel the ghost of the dead and the evil so strong that it still lingered\
  \ in the air, the energy in the room was suffocating and hard to bear. The walls\
  \ and floors were still stained with blood and from the pictures that were left\
  \ on the walls for us to see it\u2019s not that hard to imagine anymore what happened.\n\
  The effect of this on me was so profound that it completely restructured the way\
  \ I think and interact with the world. It made me want to help follow the simple\
  \ favor asked at the end of the tour.\nRemember what you have seen here and tell\
  \ everyone you see so this never has to happen again. Never Forget."
