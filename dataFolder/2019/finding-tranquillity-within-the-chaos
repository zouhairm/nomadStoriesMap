Text: "Waiting  in the long queue of the world's most popular Hindu pilgrimage centre\
  \ for ten hours straight was not easy at all. My visit to the abode of the deity\
  \ Lord Venkateswara is one which till date has been the most strenuous and at the\
  \ same time the most peaceful quest I've been on. A journey to have darshan of the\
  \ God who dwells in the seven hills of Tirumala.\n \nIt sounded absolutely crazy\
  \ and absurd to wait in a queue were devotees where divided into groups in well\
  \ equipped chambers diligently taken care of by the management authority. Every\
  \ few hours the grill was opened for us to move into the next few cells and wait\
  \ again for hours before we finally reach the sanctum. \n\nAll through the wait,\
  \ devotees kept chanting \"Sai Vengusa\" and \"Om Namo Narayana\" which was very\
  \ enchanting and devotional. I joined them in their prayers being deeply curious\
  \ about the Lord who opens his eyes to bless devotees who chants his holy name with\
  \ love and devotion. \n\nThe powerful chanting  inside the temple exuded a positive\
  \ energy  that stayed with me long after I had left the sanctum. The mad rush, non\
  \ stop chanting, heavily adorned idol and compelling aura around the deity when\
  \ we finally reached the sanctum at evening was simply alluring.  The prasadam offered\
  \ after paying visit to this powerful Lord was absolutely delicious bringing out\
  \ the taste of the South Indian cuisines and play of spices.  Being the richest\
  \ temple in the Indian subcontinent  It receives huge donations every year utilising\
  \ which they offer free food, lodging and all the necessities required to lakhs\
  \ of pilgrim vs every year.  The legend of Lord Venkateswara struck a powerful chord\
  \ within me helping me discover peace within all the chaos in life."
