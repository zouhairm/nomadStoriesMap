Text: "An unlikely, imaginative traveler makes an impulsive life change to ghost his\
  \ job and travel to Peru on the advice of a drinking buddy.  On the way, he deals\
  \ with culture shock, language shock, Lima traffic shock, folklore, and traditions\
  \ in Latin America, as well as what it's like to be a stranger in a foreign land.\n\
  \nIt's a novel, roughly inspired by true life as well as 'The Curse of Lono' and\
  \ 'Tristes Tropiques'.  I currently have about 70k words written, and it should\
  \ wind up clocking in at about 85k words.  The work was made to be serialized, however,\
  \ as I have been having it critiqued in stand-alone 700-3,000 word batches. \n\n\
  What makes this story different?  It's a fast-paced, imaginative, and sometimes\
  \ twisted personal travelogue story told from a unique narrator's POV.  Like 'The\
  \ Curse of Lono' did for Hawaii, in 'Of Pisco and Peru' the reader learns about\
  \ the countries' colorful place and history:  its foodie culture, the conquest of\
  \ the Incas by the Spaniards, the terror of the Shining Path, recent politics, and\
  \ ancient traditions.  Along the way, the narrator meets a colorful cast of characters\
  \ and places that draw the reader into the story, in a 'Buy the ticket.  Take the\
  \ ride.' kind of style."
