Text: "Every city has got a character, though metropolitan lacks it but small cities\
  \ can easily be defined by the character for example Mumbai is busy, Lucknow is\
  \ foodie and Pondicherry is beauty. When it comes to defining Varanasi, it's the\
  \ People. Yes, not the Ghats or the spiritual awakening but the people, from the\
  \ chai vendors to rickshaw-puller, every one of them constitutes Varanasi and that's\
  \ what makes the city pure. Twenty minutes into the city and one feels that they\
  \ have always been here, but obviously there's a catch to it. Don't take the cab\
  \ or be afraid to ask for help, just give it to the city and the city reciprocates\
  \ in abundance making you feel home- a connection. Every person you converse with\
  \ in Varanasi would develop such a bonding that he would become existent for you,\
  \ like you don't remember the guy who picked your luggage at Delhi station or the\
  \ cab guy who dropped you to airport but I gurantee that the auto-rickshaw guy who\
  \ received you at the Kashi airport will ever be in your memory, may be for his\
  \ style, gestures or the typical way he uses to hook a job but he would be ever\
  \ existing. Must do's at Varanasi should be \n1)Waste a day at a roadside tea vendor.\n\
  2) Smoke pot with the saintly people.\n3) Visit a hand loom factory.\n4) Don't miss\
  \ the bhang and lassi.\n5) Ghats extend more than in the travel books.\n\nRest everything\
  \ is as per the travel book, and it's also a good idea to give some time to it as\
  \ they too are potentially great but just keep in mind that the most important part\
  \ of being in Varanasi is interaction. People here have time for you, and that makes\
  \ this city great and also the oldest existing city because they value other human\
  \ beings. The key words to the city is 'Har-har Mahadev' which can be used in any\
  \ form and to translate any emotion though it literally translates into 'god exists\
  \ in everyone' . And the ultimate badge of honour would be if some local calls you\
  \ Banarasi. Happy travelling."
