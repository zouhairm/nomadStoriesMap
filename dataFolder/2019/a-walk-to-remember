Text: "It was my first trip abroad and as excited as I was, never had I expected that\
  \ a 3-day office conference in Malaysia will become an experience of a lifetime.\n\
  On the first day, I was running late for the conference and had to gobble my breakfast.\
  \ This kind woman, working as a waitress in that hotel came to clean the table when\
  \ I was finished. Noticing the number of plates she was carrying already, I gathered\
  \ mine and kept properly on top of the stack. \u201CAre you from India?\u201D She\
  \ asked. To which I replied yes, we\u2019re here for a conference. She told me that\
  \ she is from Bangladesh and loves Bollywood. We had a small chat about her move\
  \ to Malaysia, love for Bollywood and how she had always wished to visit India once.\
  \ After our brief conversation, we parted ways.\nThe second day was the time when\
  \ the rollercoaster ride started (literally). Our adventure began with a visit to\
  \ Sunway Lagoon, an adventure park where I and my manager bonded over our love for\
  \ rides. Post that, we went to Pavilion mall near our hotel for shopping. How I\
  \ wish we were good at remembering directions. A 10-minute walk became around and\
  \ round circle of 2 hours. Walking around, trying to ask people for directions to\
  \ our hotel, we bumped into two Germans (a guy and a girl). Very kind-hearted people,\
  \ who downloaded maps on their phone to help us (our phones didn\u2019t have an\
  \ international card), they became a part of our journey by offering to walk us\
  \ to our hotel so they could ensure we were safe. Unfortunately, our hotel was nowhere\
  \ to be found (even though it said 5 minutes away), an hour went by, but they didn\u2019\
  t leave our side.\nMany may think that we should have just done a taxi, *sigh* if\
  \ only the drivers didn\u2019t refuse to take us. \u201Cit\u2019s just 5 minutes\
  \ away, you can walk, why do you want to waste your 10 ringgits? Is what we got\
  \ as a reply to whenever we tried to hail a taxi.\nIt was after 2 hours that a taxi\
  \ driver agreed to take us and it turned out that our hotel\u2019s location wasn\u2019\
  t correct in Google Maps. Our new companions dropped us to our hotel and we said\
  \ our goodbyes.\nPeople often say that patience and warmth is fading away but our\
  \ sweet incidents restored our faith on humanity."
