Text: "Getting to know the Land of Glaciers is something that is in many people's\
  \ bucket list, coming all the way from wherever you are is always a long way. When\
  \ you get here, there are so many excursions to do, not just \"Perito Moreno Glacier\"\
  , which is the most famous, but there\u2019s also others that behave completely\
  \ different, they retreat and break gigantically, they stand still and move slowly.\
  \ You can\u2019t just see one, you need to see them all, each one's got a beauty\
  \ that makes them special.\n\nThis is a plan for about three or four days, five\
  \ tops if you want to make contact only with nature, but if you are like me, there\
  \ are other things you would like to know. What if you wanted to not only see the\
  \ glaciers but also make contact with the local history and their legacy at the\
  \ same time? The answer to that question is \"Estancias\", or \"ranches\", if you\
  \ prefer. The connection with these people\u2019s past that you can experience over\
  \ here can only be compared with the magnificence of a glacier breaking in front\
  \ of your eyes.\n\nPeople were brought more than one hundred years ago from all\
  \ of Europe, with the promise of cheap (almost free) land. If you brought your own\
  \ sheep or cattle, everything that your eyes could see, was yours. Most of the descendants\
  \ of these first pioneers are still living the \"Gaucho\" life but, interestingly,\
  \ they keep some of their European traditions alive. They\u2019ve got the best of\
  \ both worlds.\n\nThe harshness of the land and the cruelty of the weather were\
  \ never an obstacle for the ones that believe in this land and its promise of improvement.\
  \ Imagine for a moment all these people working so hard in a land so far from home,\
  \ still stopping for the five o'clock tea. All these British, Spanish, Welsh, German,\
  \ and even Finnish that came here with only their wives and children needed to keep\
  \ a bit of their previous lives, shown in these small gestures integrated in their\
  \ new routine. With them, came coffee and chocolate, new recipes were created here\
  \ due to the intense cold and the urgent need of calories. They also brought new\
  \ techniques to preserve meat, so they could make it last during the winter; they\
  \ brought new fashion, even new building techniques, some plants and trees too;\
  \ all to make the landscape a little bit similar from the one they left behind.\n\
  \nFrom this remote spot in Patagonia called El Calafate, you can hear stories of\
  \ violent strikes trying to free the workers; love stories between European and\
  \ native people that never ended; fearless uprising of women who became widowed\
  \ and continued their country life as \"land lord\" in a province ruled by men;\
  \ love and war, happiness and sadness all at once mixed in the normality of the\
  \ past of the people that still live in this enchanted ice covered place, believe\
  \ me when I say, the extraordinary beauty of these people's souls is just as good\
  \ as that outstanding ice field right next to them."
