Text: "We mounted motorbikes and rode through the Island of Lombok, past dusty roads,\
  \ rice paddies, local villages and wooden huts that were selling glass bottles of\
  \ gasoline and coconut oil. The scorching Indonesian sun burned down on our backs\
  \ and the distant calls to prayer echoed from the mosques. Driving through the villages\
  \ we were greeted with friendly waves, and flashes of bright white teeth smiling\
  \ back at us like sunbeams. The only difficult task was avoiding the stray dogs\
  \ sleeping in the middle of the road who were only interested in embracing every\
  \ relaxing second of that sleepy afternoon. Pulling up at a clearing we jumped off\
  \ the bikes and soaked up the tropical sky line, which was only disturbed by palm\
  \ trees that stomped all over the island like sky scrapers marking their territory.\
  \ There was a feeling in the air of adventure and possibilities. Our destination\
  \ was the pink beach, a natural wonder of nature where microscopic animals cling\
  \ to dead coral that falls away to the ocean floor, producing an awe inspiring pink\
  \ hue pigment that turns the sand to candy floss.\n\n6 hours of driving later it\
  \ was time for a pit stop, we tackled a gravel path full of potholes and were rewarded\
  \ with a deserted beach, with water like topaz and glittering golden sand. Looming\
  \ mountains proudly protected the beach, without a sun umbrella in sight. A wooden\
  \ hut was the only sign of human life on this otherworldly paradise beach, a fading\
  \ chalkboard outside the hut simply read \u2018octopus and rice\u2019. An Indonesian\
  \ lady peered out smiling ear-to-ear wearing a striking yellow patterned apron,\
  \ she instantly welcomed us despite the language barrier. We communicated with her\
  \ sons who warmly invited us to eat with them, and replied you can pay whatever\
  \ you like if you like. Her husband was a fisherman and had freshly caught an octopus\
  \ that morning, she proudly held up the dead octopus that had been drying in the\
  \ sun. \n\nFrom their beach to our plates we all sat together and shared their catch\
  \ of the day, our senses were awoken with rich and fragrant spices and flavours.\
  \ Afterwards we sat underneath the bamboo sheets with the light shining through\
  \ the cracks, our stomachs treated with bananas, Lombok coffee, and home made sticky\
  \ coconut cake. We paid but didn't leave, we all watched their sons play on the\
  \ boat in the ocean and I wondered if they were pretending to be pirates conquering\
  \ the sea, without phone signal the imagination runs wild. They hauled the heavy\
  \ boat up on to shore and created another game, jumping from the boat head first\
  \ in to the sand like wound up springs without a fear in the world. We all laughed\
  \ together, I cherished that moment of human connection from a chance encounter\
  \ that was so natural and free. We shared stories from our diverse cultures and\
  \ in return we received stories of Indonesian culture. Afterwards the fisherman\
  \ proudly showed us how he catches octopus the old fashioned way. Keenly running\
  \ towards the sea with nothing more than a snorkel and a sharp metal spike in his\
  \ hand ready to spear his pray, he was a true octopus hunter and wanted to share\
  \ his tricks of the trade. \n\nWith heavy hearts we said our goodbyes and embarked\
  \ on our bikes, on quest for the pink beach. We zoomed up and down hills, around\
  \ impossibly narrow corners and through forests until we reached the end of the\
  \ Island. Finally we caught a glimpse of our destination, we peered through the\
  \ thinning trees in anticipation to see the famous pink beach, we started squinting\
  \ only to find the sand was plain regular white sand, like sugar!. Pink sand is\
  \ only visible at certain times of the day in certain light, yet even after exhaustion\
  \ from travelling hours to see something that wasn't there, we didn\u2019t care.\
  \ After a good old laugh about our sore motorbike bums, it was fair to say life\
  \ is about the journey and the people you meet along the way, and not always about\
  \ the final destination."
