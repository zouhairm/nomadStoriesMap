Text: "\u201CLance,\u201D called Aunt Jenna, who held the velvet drawstring bag in\
  \ her arms, cradling it gently, \u201Ctake a quick one.\u201D She unraveled it before\
  \ she knelt and laid the urn bare on the sun-dappled burial ground. I snapped the\
  \ picture. I caught myself gazing at the navy-blue matte urn, which had silver silhouettes\
  \ depicting birds of unknown kind. They soared in a crescent alignment, over and\
  \ above what looked like the night sky. The air tasted of dust, but had a wafting\
  \ scent of a malty, earthy wheat bread. \nAunt Jenna buried the urn deep into the\
  \ plot hole.\n\u201CHe always said to me when it\u2019s his time to leave,\u201D\
  \ Aunt Jenna recalled, \u201Cjust put my urn in an apple crate and let it drift\
  \ aimlessly into the ocean.\u201D\n\u201CSounds like James, alright,\u201D Muriel\
  \ sighed, Uncle James\u2019s sister.\nBeyond the wrought iron fences was where the\
  \ vast jaundiced wheat crop fields were; and aloft them was a solitary bird in the\
  \ clear skies, far-flung for me to ever recognize. Penetrated those skies were the\
  \ grain elevators and enclosing them were agrarian facility complexes. Muriel pointed\
  \ at these Southern skyscrapers and alluded: \u201CThey\u2019re the Hutterites\u2019\
  \ domicile and travail.\u201D \nI didn\u2019t know what any of those words meant.\n\
  On our way to the Village of Heisler, I watched the prairie from Muriel\u2019s Caravan,\
  \ like a cinematic film. I watched it incessantly shift its landscapes, as if there\
  \ was an omnipotent projectionist behind this work of segue. The untouched plain\
  \ and arid valley lands; to the grasslands inhabited by blotches and patches of\
  \ sedge or rushes; and to the pastures settled by horses and cattle. What remained\
  \ changeless were the infinite sky and the endless path of overhead power lines.\
  \ \nWhen we arrived, we were welcomed by a Stalin-moustached man holding a foam-overflowed\
  \ beer in his right hand and wore a red Alpine hat on a rustic wooden signboard.\
  \ But, what really caught my attention was this ridiculously oversized baseball\
  \ glove monument, and an uneventful sandlot behind the signboard. 90s signs were\
  \ affixed to a coach\u2019s box, and like marquee signs, they exclusively paid tribute\
  \ to Heisler\u2019s baseball teams, the Cardinals and the Mosquitoes, for visitors\
  \ to see. \nWe then skimmed through the only insipid, lackadaisical main street\
  \ of Heisler, which had diminutive rows of orthodoxical town buildings: a general\
  \ store, a lodge, and a diner. The main street was laid out like the street you\
  \ would normally see in an old Clint Eastwood Western film. It was, however, accented\
  \ by life-size cut-outs of a Lederhosen boy (who held a baseball bat and wore a\
  \ baseball glove) and a Dirndl girl (who had a baseball in her clenched hand).\n\
  Secluded in a corner was a mobile home that functioned as both a Canadian post office\
  \ and a mini library. Among all the establishments they had in town, I was genuinely\
  \ interested in the mini library and its garish, polychromatic, semi-cursive, self-referential\
  \ sign: Library. Muriel mentioned to us that Uncle James had once owned that mini\
  \ library. Serendipity. But the venue had led me to think that it was where one\
  \ could get the most out of little Heisler. Was that the reason why Uncle James\
  \ left Heisler?\nOn the chalky brick red path, we observed each individual house\
  \ separately, like it was a realm of its own. The liveliest I saw of Heisler was\
  \ the townsfolks idling in the front yard of their houses, arranging garden ornaments\
  \ \u2014 miniature statues of gnomes, flamingos, fairies, elves, and Eastern Island\
  \ monolith statues \u2014 or watering their green foliage. \nFrom Heisler to Edmonton,\
  \ I got to see the wetland where the ducks congregate in their waterfowl commune,\
  \ seemed all too ready for winter to arrive and for them to depart South. They were\
  \ in a disfigured V-formation, sporadically flapping their crescentic wings on standing\
  \ water that had the likeness of the navy-blue skies. I had never seen anything\
  \ like it. \n\u201CDucks are really smart, eh?\u201D Aunt Jenna mumbled under her\
  \ breath. I didn\u2019t pay much mind to what she said. But, in retrospect, I distinctly\
  \ remembered Aunt Jenna telling me about how Uncle James\u2019s family member each\
  \ had their best-loved animal. Uncle James\u2019s animal was a duck."
