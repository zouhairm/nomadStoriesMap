Text: "Scotland has a rich history full of characters and stories that stretch out\
  \ over many mouthfuls of haggis. A cultural experience like no other. Their accent\
  \ makes you smile, laugh and if you find yourself on a small boat on a Loch, you'll\
  \ occasionally find yourself leaning in to find out exactly what has been said.\
  \ The Scottish people are full of life. \n\nThe people always make the place. Everybody\
  \ has a story. Making a connection to the locals embraces you in their way of life.\
  \ Sometimes, when you drift from the main route and start hiking up a gravel path\
  \ away from civilisation, you might find yourself connecting with a picturesque\
  \ mountain range. You might find yourself connecting with a guide. Another possibility\
  \ that hasn't been mentioned yet would be a strong connection with the reindeer\
  \ that call the Cairngorm Mountains in the highlands of Scotland, home. \n\nSix\
  \ miles from Aviemore, the main ski town in Scotland is a small town called Glenmore.\
  \ This is where it all began. Before I skip too far ahead, I'll bring you up to\
  \ speed on how I became a volunteer reindeer herder and connected with this majestic\
  \ creature.\n\nI moved to Scotland from sunny Australia. I decided that living in\
  \ Edinburgh, Scotland was a great way to experience the way my grandparents lived.\
  \ The cobblestone roads were amazing. I met people from all over the world. I made\
  \ new friends. My friends from home thought it was time for them to depart the four\
  \ season lifestyle of Scotland. My birthday was just around the corner and I receive\
  \ an e-mail from home suggesting I go to visit the reindeer for my birthday. So\
  \ we hitched a ride from Edinburgh up to the highlands. We found a comfortably cheap\
  \ place to lay our heads for the evening and before we knew it, we were at Reindeer\
  \ house.\n\nThe birthday started out with a courteous car ride from the local train\
  \ station to the base of the mountains where the reindeer herders lived. After a\
  \ wee yarn and a laugh, we had our wellies on our feet that were unaware of what\
  \ was about to become of them. We hiked up the gravel path with a giant bag of food\
  \ over our shoulder for the reindeer. Well, my friends had the food. I had the unfortunate\
  \ (clearly kidding) job of walking a baby reindeer, Grunter, up the hill. \n\nWhen\
  \ we made it to the Cairngorm Mountains, we said our goodbyes to Grunter and were\
  \ given our very own fully grown reindeer to join us on our trek for the next four\
  \ hours. I was fortunate to have a white reindeer named Bhoy show me the beauty\
  \ of the highlands. We walked high and we walked low as he nudged me for more food.\
  \ It didn't take much motivation to help my new friend feed his hungry belly. As\
  \ Bhoy and I sat atop the Cairngorm Mountains taking in the views,  I realised a\
  \ connection had quickly formed. \n\nWalking back to reindeer house, I was invited\
  \ to stay on. As my friends were leaving for Australia soon, I had something to\
  \ think about. I took the opportunity to visit my family and friends in Scotland\
  \ and England. Within two weeks, I was back in the highlands volunteering as a reindeer\
  \ herder. I was helping Santa Clause. \n\nI learned everything I needed to know\
  \ about reindeer, from living with them. They happened to be filming a documentary\
  \ at the time about the life of the reindeer and the four seasons they live through\
  \ every year. I was asked (not by the reindeer) by the the family and the film makers\
  \ if I would like to provide the soundtrack to the documentary. I found it a fitting\
  \ way to share my journey with the reindeer. \n\nI'd like to think if I spoke with\
  \ Grunter or Bhoy over some lichen, we'd reminisce on old times. If you find yourself\
  \ in the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland, go and say hello to the reindeer. Tell\
  \ them I sent you and you might even see some secret local spots. Enjoy."
