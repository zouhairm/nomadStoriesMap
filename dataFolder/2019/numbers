Text: "This genocide is my age. That\u2019s the first thing I remember thinking. \n\
  \nIf you\u2019re lucky, there\u2019s an entire realm of agony that you just won\u2019\
  t process\u2014 as far into your mind as you probe, you can\u2019t find a single\
  \ moment like it. So maybe you turn to something you understand, like math. Like\
  \ a genocide that\u2019s in its twenties. While your mother taught you which animal\
  \ made neigh and which made moo, this genocide was tossing mothers into mass graves.\
  \ Today, while you stumble into adulthood, a Rwanda-sized wound is slowly scabbing,\
  \ blood is drying, bones are falling deeper into the earth. You don\u2019t know\
  \ pain like genocide, but you do know numbers.\n\n\u201CYou need two of those,\u201D\
  \ Yusta tells me through our translator, pointing at the small blade in my hand.\
  \ I grab another curved knife from the basket on the ground, and we begin walking\
  \ up the side of a hill in Kivumu, Rwanda. \n\nYusta is a matriarch and a craftswoman\u2014\
  \ the founder of an all-female collective that weaves and sells art together\u2014\
  \ but above all else, she is curious. \u201CHow old are you?\u201D she asks me in\
  \ her native tongue, Kinyarwanda. When I respond with \u201Ctwenty\u201D, she breaks\
  \ into a wide smile. \u201CAre you married? Do you have a boyfriend?\u201D I laugh\
  \ and say that yes, I have a boyfriend, but marriage isn\u2019t in the cards yet.\
  \ Despite all her dignity, she bursts into giggles. \u201CI bet he\u2019s handsome,\u201D\
  \ she laughs.\n\nI don\u2019t know where we\u2019re walking, but I do know that\
  \ I\u2019m not doing a very good job of it\u2014 Yusta\u2019s bare feet cradle the\
  \ earth, while I\u2019m tripping on coffee sprouts and young plantain trees with\
  \ every step. I try not to look to my left, where our little dirt path plunges into\
  \ a steep valley studded with families of goats and their farmers. Finally, we stop.\n\
  \n\u201CThis is sisal,\u201D Yusta proudly gestures to the big, green, cactus-like\
  \ bush in front of us. She sits cross-legged in front of the plant, and I follow.\
  \ \n\nWithout speaking, she pulls out the small knives we took on our hike and begins\
  \ to run the blade over the sisal leaves, shaving off their light green sheath to\
  \ reveal white fibers underneath. Her strokes are slow, her hands grounded in generations\
  \ of women weavers.\n\n\u201CSo you know about genocide,\u201D she remarks as she\
  \ untangles the plant\u2019s white fibers.\n\nThe midday sun, gentle and warm, suddenly\
  \ becomes an unbearable, pulsing heat on my forehead. My breath hitches. \n\n\u201C\
  I\u2014 I know about it,\u201D I cough out, focusing my gaze on the smooth, solid\
  \ movements of her fingers. Yusta is dipping the sisal fibers in a small bowl of\
  \ water, swirling them into a bright yellow dye.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m the only one\
  \ in my family alive,\u201D she says. It\u2019s not a declaration of pride, or a\
  \ bid for sympathy: it\u2019s just truth.\n\nThe white fibers are turning a deep,\
  \ brilliant gold. Her fingers move faster. \u201CThe men came into my house,\u201D\
  \ she points to a small cabin down the valley. \u201CThey had big knives, the size\
  \ of an arm.\u201D She carefully removes the dyed fibers, laying them on the edge\
  \ of the bowl to dry.\n\n\u201CWe heard them coming, so my mother told me to hide\
  \ inside a chest. They cut off the head of my mother, and then my father and my\
  \ older brother. I heard when they stopped screaming.\u201D She begins braiding\
  \ the dried ropes, now strings of gold. \n\n\u201CI stayed inside that chest for\
  \ two days.\u201D\n\nThe valley buzzes with life\u2014 creatures with wings and\
  \ bleating baby goats and the creak of the sisal as Yusta meticulously weaves. We\
  \ don\u2019t speak, but she reaches out and puts the ropes in my hands, gently guiding\
  \ my fingers along her braiding pattern.\n\n\u201CI love this valley,\u201D she\
  \ finally sighs, handing me a finished set of sisal earrings. The two deep, golden\
  \ loops sit in my palms. \n\nThe genocide will soon turn 25, but the capacity to\
  \ forgive is infinite. Mercy forsakes logic, math, numbers.\n\nI thread the yellow\
  \ circles into my ears and let them hang there as Yusta and I head home for lunch."
