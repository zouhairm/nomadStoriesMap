Text: "It was 2015, a group of 3 people heard about a waterfall that hasn't commercialized\
  \ yet, near a village in south side of Malang, East Java, Indonesia. We gathered\
  \ the information about this waterfall, and finally found the name of it. It called\
  \ Coban Tundo (coban means waterfall in Javanese language). It was friday, and we\
  \ decided to go on the next day by motorcycle.\n\nA three-hours ride to Sidoasri\
  \ Village and encourage ourselves to ask locals about the existence of this Coban\
  \ Tundo. Long story short, after a small talk and a cup of coffee by the main street,\
  \ the locals agreed to take us to Coban Tundo \u2014 on one condition, ones who\
  \ drive the motorcycle must have advanced level of driving motorcycle. I just innocently\
  \ agreed to the condition on that day while asking myself why. Then, my question\
  \ is answered shortly after a 15 minutes ride through residential area. We're going\
  \ uphill! And yes, it's an off-road ride with only roughly one metre width. On the\
  \ right side of the road are cliffs, and on the left side of the road is a very\
  \ deep ravine which my friends almost got themselves fall into. It took us almost\
  \ 45 minutes alone to ride up the hill.\n\nUntil we finally get to our destination\
  \ \u2014 Coban Tundo. For the record, I have been to various natural tourist attractions,\
  \ from East Java to Central Kalimantan. And I can proudly say this is by far the\
  \ most epic object I have ever seen. That was literally the exact words that came\
  \ out of my mouth when I get to see Coban Tundo. It was astounding.\n\nThe experience\
  \ didn't stop there, there is a really big rock that people can jump out of. Of\
  \ course I tried, the feeling was always here, in my heart. Oh, almost forgot, right\
  \ in front of the waterfall I could see the forest down below which made it more\
  \ interesting. After a brief hour of swimming under the waterfall, we decided to\
  \ head back to town. We get the chance to say bye and thank you to the locals for\
  \ the hospitality.\n\nAnd then breaking news struck us real hard. Three days after\
  \ our visit to Coban Tundo, turns out there was an accident that cost one life at\
  \ Coban Tundo. The victim got dragged into the deep by the waterfall. She couldn't\
  \ make it. I was thinking what if that person is me, one of my friends, or one of\
  \ the locals that drowned that day. Can't even imagine the loss.\n\nTo hear that\
  \ news, was really heartbreaking. Though I learn something from it: do more research\
  \ about the object you're about to visit, is it dangerous, and what's the worst\
  \ thing that could happen. Also I took down all photos of Coban Tundo from my instagram\
  \ account, let my memories be eternal in my mind."
