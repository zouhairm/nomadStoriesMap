Text: "In my mind, I've travelled to all the places I've ever read or watched about.\
  \ Seen the beaches of Hawaii, Cherry blossoms of Japan, captured pictures of monkeys\
  \ sitting on a tree in Costa Rica, spent nights in a capsule in Korea, met delightful\
  \ people of Puerto Rico, even explored Mexico. This is all in my head, all in my\
  \ tiny brain with mighty thoughts. \nReality is I've never seen these places, not\
  \ even toured my own county properly . This won't hold me back. My journey is to\
  \ keep myself motivated. Motivated to hustle. Motivated to make my dreams a reality.\
  \ Motivated to keep my self positive with the ups and downs of this journey. A journey\
  \ towards recognising myself in and out and learning the Art of self love and taking\
  \ responsibility of decorating my life that's given to me. \nBeing alone is the\
  \ most precious thing that people don't give themselves. A chance to blow away the\
  \ clouds that bring darkness and clutter our minds. Filling our minds with someone's\
  \ negativity or distress. There's nothing better than solo traveling to heal a \
  \ ripped soul that's put together with a fragile bandage. An opportunity of self\
  \ actualization and knowing the power that comes from within. That positivity comes\
  \ from within and we ourselves are the special one we keep looking for. Beauty is\
  \ everywhere, question is are we grateful enough for all the things we've been given.\
  \ Are we grateful for all the clothes we don't care to wear, the food we take pictures\
  \ of and don't care to finish, all the space that we have that we don't share, people\
  \ that we don't care to love. Are we lack of objects or are we lack of gratitude\
  \ ? Lack of gratitude towards our family, towards friends, towards the world. Filling\
  \ our holes with drugs, sex, and money. Not just filling, it's flooding. \nMy travel\
  \ would be of a girl who comes from a small beautiful town. Who wants to alter herself\
  \ from whom she was before. From a girl who felt so little about herself. Lacked\
  \ confidence, low self esteem, a food addict. My travel is not just a world tour.\
  \ Its a tour of building so much positivity in herself that people around her could\
  \ feel the contagious power. My tour is specially of self love. The Art of self\
  \ love.  My journey would be to do the exact thing that I hated to do, rather afraid\
  \ of. Seeing herself in pictures. Meeting new people. If there's any job that I\
  \ would do, this is the one. The one that kept me in a dark hole for most of my\
  \ teenage years. Touring around to meet random people. Struggle to speak their language.\
  \ Make silly hand signs to tell people where I want to go. Find out what similarities\
  \ different cultures have. Understanding differences. Taking pictures infront of\
  \ a beach in Miami or with a camel in Dubai. Capturing my first picture in a snowfall\
  \ in Nepal. Sitting on a chair alone in an airport somewhere thinking how wonderful\
  \ my life already is.\nA journey filled with new people and stories. Travelling\
  \ not to find happiness but to share it with other people. Sharing it to my friends\
  \ and family, the experiences that I would have out in the unknown. Keeping in mind\
  \ that I'm mysteriously protected even outside my dark box. To get lost to find\
  \ the right way. To find the right people you were intended to meet. To find unfriendly\
  \ faces to humble welcomes. To throw myself to the unknown to know exactly who I\
  \ am. Understanding people to make myself understand that it's the most human thing\
  \ I can do. Meet a new life in a train, a new story while waiting for the receiptionist.\
  \ Know a new life style while buying an ugly hat at some stall or even learn some\
  \ travel hack from a fellow tourist. Leap to the unknown would be to explore my\
  \ deepest self. To conquer the fears that I had adapted. To bring my teen self,\
  \ holding her hand into the light from the dark box she locked herself in. Seeing\
  \ the beauty that's shining in the light."
