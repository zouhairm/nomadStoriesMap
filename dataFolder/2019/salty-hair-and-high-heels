Text: "The pungent scent of dirt filled the warm, salty air. With the absence of any\
  \ moon, the darkness enveloped me and the blindness I felt was unnerving. Yet I\
  \ wasn\u2019t scared. Her strong curves wrapped around me and we were literally\
  \ tethered to one another. Her hull cut through the water as we followed our course.\
  \ Until the grey light would begin to creep in like a slowly developing polaroid\
  \ picture, we would put our faith in our equipment. It was 4am, I was both exhausted\
  \ and exhilarated, ready for disaster but praying it wouldn\u2019t strike. A sound\
  \ in the water not one meter from where I sat caught my attention. Reaching for\
  \ the flashlight, the steady beam of light penetrated the foreboding water and illuminated\
  \ the creatures below. \n\nThe click of my heels on the pavement was almost melodic,\
  \ and the sound made me feel important. I remembered as a child, wishing my shoes\
  \ would sound important. Dreaming of the day I would wear business attire instead\
  \ of a cheap, wrinkled t-shirt and sneakers. Glancing at my watch, I clenched my\
  \ jaw, I was late. I was always late. My life was a series of schedules I couldn\u2019\
  t keep. Each revolving around a life I had dreamt of, a life I thought I wanted.\
  \ It was my youngest sons spilt cereal that caused the delay, the milk filling every\
  \ crevice like a wave crashing onto the beach and disappearing in the sand. I had\
  \ to peel his sticky fingers from my arm, clutched ever so tightly, and skulk away,\
  \ his cries echoing in my ears as I disappeared.\n\nThe rays of light reflected\
  \ their shiny bodies as they moved effortlessly through the lustrous water. Like\
  \ children, playful and boisterous, their raucous was exaggerated in the eerily\
  \ still night. My first instinct was to awaken the crew, to allow them to revel\
  \ in this wonderment. Yet, pat of me wanted the experience to be sacred, just for\
  \ me.  For fifteen minutes they would play in ROAM\u2019s wake, silence intercepted\
  \ by spurts of water from their blowhole, darting and weaving through the ray of\
  \ light that made the water now appear a deep azure.\n\nRemote in hand, my husband\
  \ mindlessly scrolled through the options. \u201CLet's watch a documentary,\u201D\
  \ he said unenthusiastically. I didn\u2019t care what we watched, I was looking\
  \ at the book of faces as I did every night around this time. \u201CI doubt I\u2019\
  ll even be awake in ten minutes,\u201D I thought to myself. One and a half hours\
  \ later the credits continued to roll in the background of our large living room.\
  \ We turned to look at one another, perhaps for the first time that day. There was\
  \ a twinkle in his eye, and I knew he felt the same way. Something had changed in\
  \ those ninety minutes and little did we know but from that moment on, our lives\
  \ would never be the same.  \n\nThe radio crackled to life, and a heavily accented\
  \ voice filled the silence. \u201CSailing Vessel Roam, Roam, Roam, this is Jewel\
  \ of the Seas, over.\u201D My sons raised their sleepy heads, their long blonde\
  \ hair a tangled mop around their tanned faces. \u201CThis is Sailing vessel Roam,\u201D\
  \ I replied into the handheld microphone. \u201CGood evening Roam, I am approaching\
  \ on your port side, no need to alter course.\u201D My husband was now by my side,\
  \ in between transmissions we would giggle like children. I was speaking to the\
  \ captain of a 1000ft cruise ship. Me! \u201CRoger that captain, you have a good\
  \ night,\u201D I said almost bursting with pride. \n\n\u201CThat\u2019s the most\
  \ ridiculous thing we\u2019ve ever heard,\u201D screeched my sisters, almost in\
  \ unison. \u201CYou don\u2019t even know how to sail,\u201D cried my mother. Our\
  \ decision had been made, we were not asking for permission, yet naively we craved\
  \ it. Almost two years from that day, the five of us would board a plane for the\
  \ Caribbean island of Grenada, our yacht, bought sight unseen, was waiting for us.\
  \ It\u2019s true, we weren\u2019t sailors, we didn\u2019t know what we were getting\
  \ ourselves into, but we needn\u2019t have worried. Taking that leap into the unknown\
  \ would end up being the best decision we ever made."
