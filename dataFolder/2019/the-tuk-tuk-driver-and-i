Text: "The first time I went travelling I found myself in Thailand, being a fan of\
  \ the unique cuisine and interesting ingredients I had always wanted to tour the\
  \ country to get a taste of the authentic Thai-flavours. From the usual tourist\
  \ spots, to towns a little further of the beaten track, I eventually found myself\
  \ in Chiang Mai and fell immediately in love. The markets, the cafes, the fragrances,\
  \ the smiling locals, my senses were abuzz!\n\nI had been fortunate enough to arrive\
  \ already having been given a connection in the town from a colleague, a softly\
  \ spoken gentlemen named Chai, who owned Chang Chalaad, a funky little bar/cafe\
  \ in the old town serving up delicious noodle broths and curries, and Thai-inspired\
  \ cocktails. He also practiced traditional Thai massage in a studio above the bar\
  \ and was in training with a local Buddhist monk in meditation telling me that he\
  \ believed this mindfulness training would help him become a better masseuse.\n\n\
  Chai ended up being an integral part of my stay in Chiang Mai, taking me on a pilgrimage\
  \ to a far away, and not so easily accessible temple - a brief sojourn for him to\
  \ ask the monks a question about the possibility of a mediation stay with them.\
  \ Visiting his bar and having a traditional Thai massage from him is highly recommended\
  \ (15/1 Sripoom, Soi 1 Ampoe Muang Chiang Mai 50200 Thailand).\n\nIt was on my way\
  \ to meet him for the first time that I made a truly unique connection. \n\nOutside\
  \ my accomodation I hailed down a tuk-tuk driver and asked him to take me to Chai\u2019\
  s bar. His name was Neung and he lived in a little village on the outskirts of the\
  \ Old Town. The conversation en route to the bar was insightful and easy, myself\
  \ practising my Thai and Neung practicing his English. He gave me tips and pointers\
  \ on places to go and visit, restaurants and cafeterias to eat the REAL Thai food.\
  \ Upon being dropped off I asked him for his number so that I might use him again.\
  \ Hey over the 5 days I was in Chiang Mai Neung was at my hotel each and every morning\
  \ without being called and would take me from place to place showing me the best\
  \ of what the town could offer, always with the biggest smile on his face. On my\
  \ last day he asked if it would interest me to go and visit his village and meet\
  \ his friends and family, an opportunity that I jumped at. \n\nOn the way there,\
  \ about a 45 minute tuk-tuk ride away, we stopped at his friends convenience store\
  \ and he bought us a couple of local longneck beers, and then outside the shop his\
  \ friend fried up some flying ants, tossing them in a sticky soy-based sauce (a\
  \ seasonal local delicacy), the beer a great palate cleanser to the sweet and salty\
  \ ants.\n\nWe then ventured on to his humble home, and picked up his wife and two\
  \ children, him telling me that it was 4:30 and they had somewhere to be. We drove\
  \ a few streets away from his home and pulled into another house, where a lady greated\
  \ us outside with a little covered cart and coal bbq. She gave me a paper plate\
  \ with some bbq\u2019d meat which I found out after the fact to be pigs liver, and\
  \ handed me a cup of black Chinese whisky with ice to wash it down with. I have\
  \ to say it was one of the best \u201Cdining\u201D experiences of my whole trip\
  \ - the liver had been marinated in spices and was smoky from the bbd, a truly unexpected\
  \ treat! As we stayed and chatted more and more people from the neighbourhood arrived\
  \ for some whisky and liver, said their sa-wad-ee-khrap/khaas, staying briefly or\
  \ for a while. Neung told me that this was a daily ritual however the location changed\
  \ every day to someone else\u2019s house - and the whole time no baht was exchanged\
  \ for the services. \n\nThis was certainly the highlight of my trip, and I felt\
  \ so lucky to experience the true meaning of community, and sharing in their happiness.\
  \ Until we meet again Neung!"
