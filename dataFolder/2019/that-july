Text: "Always had my schemes so clear. Never thought things were going to be that\
  \ way. But life has a curious habit to surprise ourselves without asking. Sometimes\
  \ for the good, others for not. And in the very end you cannot regret anything -\
  \ you\u2019re greatful because remembering means having lived. \nSo I cannot regret\
  \ the decisions which made me turned up in Canterbury. Neither those first afternoons\
  \ crossing the west gate, jumping onto the medieval time, under that summer haze.\
  \ \nI close my eyes and I everything comes back again. That crazy night when your\
  \ team lost the match. Me convincing my very best soulmate to go to that club. Those\
  \ eyes in the crowd. And your first hi. \nI still remember me and you and you and\
  \ me teasing the another like two children. Our running competitions and how you\
  \ always lost, and how I always cheated. You picking me in your arms and me kicking\
  \ nowhere. Our very first kiss. Our very last, not knowing it was though. That damn\
  \ promise in front of the McDonalds. All the \u201Csee yous\u201D as we both were\
  \ too bad at goodbyes. Me taking the Main Street, crossing that bridge, listening\
  \ to \u201CDon\u2019t look back in anger\u201D and not looking back indeed. We both\
  \ know that if I had done so, I wouldn\u2019t been now there writing this.\nAnd\
  \ I suppose that maybe the blame is on me for feeling everything so fast. So deep.\
  \ Maybe the blame was on that damn fairytale city, its gothic cathedral that spied\
  \ all our conversations, its wall which didn\u2019t realize what was happening at\
  \ all. Maybe the blame was on you proposing going punting and on all the mysterious\
  \ stories we were told. And maybe everything fore-mentioned is true. Or maybe I\u2019\
  m wrong. But there\u2019s one thing for sure- that summer I learnt that life is\
  \ not about years or months, but moments. That languages aren\u2019t a barrier for\
  \ two people if they don\u2019t want them to be. That casualties exist, but the\
  \ \u201Ctwo times in a row\u201D don\u2019t. And that blind connections happen and\
  \ you\u2019re the evidence of this. That summer I learnt that love is not about\
  \ time, that falling in is easy, that falling down is not. That you can like a place,\
  \ just like a tourist will do. But the only way you can fall in love with it is\
  \ by diving into their gastronomy, into their monuments, their legends. Into their\
  \ people. And when you begin to dive, you\u2019re assuming the risk of sinking.\
  \ And I promised I\u2019ll take it again and again, as I discovered that the pros\
  \ of wanderlust overweight the cons. \nAlways thought our time is short and the\
  \ world so big. Always thought we need to share our lives with the ones we care\
  \ of. And never I had it clearer than know. Today is Sunday and I\u2019m thinking\
  \ about making an exception and telling you something that I wasn\u2019t supposed\
  \ to: I\u2019m thinking about coming back to that city. What about meeting in front\
  \ of the McDonald\u2019s and starting planning our world tour? I swear you\u2019\
  re the one I want to do it with."
