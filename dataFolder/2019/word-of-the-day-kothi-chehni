Text: "My mom always gets scared on narrow mountain trails, this time was no different.\
  \ In the middle of the hike I hear my mother say \u201CThis is getting too steep\
  \ for my 55-year-old legs\u201D and as if the irony was god sent, a 70-year-old\
  \ lady carrying house supplies on a rucksack holds my hand and takes me along with\
  \ her while I leave my mother on the side of the mountain trail to start her descent.\
  \ The lady had freckles on every part of her skin from the prolonged sun exposure\
  \ at such high altitudes. \nDespite the communication gap that we had, there were\
  \ 2 words she understood-'Kothi Chehni', she pointed at the structure multiple times\
  \ during the climb. The only thing visible to my myopic, prescription aided eyes\
  \ was a slanting roof and a long way to go. She accompanied me to the orchard plantations\
  \ just outside the village and from there we both went our separate ways.\n\nAfter\
  \ accidentally walking into the backyard of an unsuspecting local family, I was\
  \ given another local guide in the form of a 9-year-old boy who was excited to see\
  \ a person with purple hair and just wanted to touch them in return of the services.\
  \ The village of Chehni, according to legends has had residents since the time of\
  \ Pandavas and the families that currently inhabit the village are said to be descendants.\n\
  \nThe entire village has been isolated from the fast-paced lifestyle of nearby towns\
  \ and there is only a mountain path to get to the village, the locals make frequent\
  \ trips up and down every day, much to the envy of non-athletic tourists out for\
  \ a day of intense cardio. The village is only visited by enthusiastic travellers\
  \ or the government officials, which again is limited by the weather conditions.\
  \ The village has a portion of flat land around the fort a.k.a \u201CKothi Chehni\u201D\
  \ and it serves as the community courtyard. Supplies are either raised by the residents\
  \ or bought from the nearby towns of Banjar and Jibhi.\n\nThe residents in typical\
  \ mountain fashion have Mongolian features and sun-tanned skin and the harshness\
  \ of the mountain weather gives them flushed cheeks and bleached blonde hair tips.\
  \ The children tend to catch the fancy of the visitors and they sometimes innocently\
  \ pose for the camera whereas the rest of the residents try to complete their daily\
  \ tasks before sunset.\n\n\u201CKothi Chehni\u201D is a 5-storey building with a\
  \ Kath-Kuni architecture, something that is almost exclusive to the Tirthan Valley\
  \ area of Himachal Pradesh. The Kath-Kuni architecture is created by interlocking\
  \ wooden beams to increase the structural integrity of the building with the top\
  \ part of the tower protruding outwards to form a balcony-like structure. The fort\
  \ was known to have 7-storey architecture, but two floors were lost in the 1905\
  \ Kangra earthquake. The closer one gets to the building the more utility one can\
  \ see in the form of, a military stronghold, a storage unit, a watchtower serving\
  \ as a vantage point for the Thakur dynasty since the fort strategically looks over\
  \ the entire valley. The structure has no fixed staircase so that the temporary\
  \ ones can be retracted inside in the event of a siege. Next to the fort is a Krishna\
  \ temple but casual tourists like me are not allowed inside either the fort or the\
  \ temple. The locals say it\u2019s safer for the visitor and it preserves the architecture.\n\
  \nTowards the end of my somewhat solo adventure into this mystical realm, a place\
  \ that is known to many but not seen by enough due to its general inaccessibility\
  \ by the road, I look for my partners in crime for the descent back. I go around\
  \ the small village looking for my father and my brother only to find them sitting\
  \ in an outdoor caf\xE9, drinking tea and consuming large quantities of junk food,\
  \ which is something out of the ordinary here. \n\nI forgot to mention that like\
  \ my mother I too am a little scared of narrow mountain trails and the descent back\
  \ was full of tears and crawling and trying to hold on to every tree branch, for\
  \ support."
