Text: "In 2018, I graduated from high school and planned to attend college for the\
  \ next four years. Instead, I found an organization known as EF. They were advertising\
  \ their new program, which was a Gap Year. I decided to apply towards the end of\
  \ my senior year, mainly as a joke. I had no intention of fulfilling this idea,\
  \ but ended up being accepted and whisked away to travel the world for 26 weeks.\
  \ For six of those weeks, I was located in the Dominican Republic. For two of those\
  \ weeks, I was located in Monte Cristi, teaching English to children.\n\nThose two\
  \ weeks were some of the most influential, difficult weeks of my life. The children\
  \ in the public schools were young, and were very limited in resources. For breakfast,\
  \ they were given a small piece of bread and a juice box. There was no guarantee\
  \ they were going to eat at home. Children could go weekends without eating much,\
  \ but were grateful for a small piece of bread at their local school. It was heartbreaking,\
  \ yet these children inspired me with their positivity, enthusiasm to learn, and\
  \ overall happiness.\n\nDuring those two weeks, I worked with two different classes.\
  \ One class consisted of 41 students and the other of 34. There was only one teacher\
  \ in each classroom, which was hard for such an overcrowded area. The teachers used\
  \ violence and harsh words to reprimand those who were perceived as \"trouble-makers.\"\
  \ It was difficult to watch, as I have never been one for violence, but it is also\
  \ a part of the culture there. Yet, during those two weeks I was punched in the\
  \ nose, broke up a large fight, and confiscated two razor blades from two different\
  \ children. Even so, I loved each and every one of them.\n\nEach child was so proud\
  \ of every assignment given. They ran after their teachers during recess, begging\
  \ us to play their games. They held our hands, led us around the school yard, and\
  \ smiled endlessly. Even when they were in trouble, there was nothing a pat on the\
  \ shoulder could not fix. Some of the children did not see compassion, or even smiles,\
  \ at home. When you smiled and gave them encouragement during classes, their faces\
  \ would become illuminated. It was a feeling that is truly indescribable, to see\
  \ what an impact a simple smile had on their attitudes.\n\nSome days were much harder\
  \ than others. Occasionally, I would leave the classroom with a feeling of defeat.\
  \ Whether it was another fight had broken out, or the class was particularly rowdy\
  \ that day, I would feel defeated. I would even leave with tears in my eyes, later\
  \ crying once I was away from the children. It was an emotional roller coaster,\
  \ but only because of what I did not know. I did not know what these children experienced\
  \ day-to-day, only what I could see in the classroom. I had no concept of their\
  \ home lives, but knew it was reflected in their behavior. I never once blamed those\
  \ children, but more myself for not having a better understanding.\n\nBefore coming\
  \ to teach, I had no idea what to expect. The program I was with did not want you\
  \ to have expectations, but rather goals. One rule, out of ten the program had,\
  \ was \"It's not about you.\" I followed that every day. No matter how hard, how\
  \ emotional, or how difficult it was, it was not about me. It was about the children,\
  \ and helping make an impact on their lives. To see their smiles, to feel their\
  \ energy as they clasp your hand, and to show patience, compassion, and love. To\
  \ remind them that no matter what, someone out there loves them and wants to see\
  \ them succeed. I took a chance on not only myself, but more importantly those children.\
  \ They changed my life, even if it sounds clich\xE9. I will never forget the children\
  \ of JFK in Monte Cristi, Dominican Republic."
