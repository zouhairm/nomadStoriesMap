Text: "I was late once again. I'd followed a rabbit down a cobble-stoned side street\
  \ to a little cafe tucked into the heart of the maze that was Seville, Spain. Seville\
  \ wasn't like Barcelona...the favorite of the girls in my study-abroad group who\
  \ preferred the shopping and scale of the coming of age city.  But I loved Seville\
  \ for reasons like this. Getting lost for hours in the twists and turns of a place\
  \ you could look up and feel as if for a moment you were in any century. It was\
  \ timeless. And I was time-less quite literally, as my Documentary film-making professor\
  \ was eagerly waiting to point out. \n   I looked around for some resemblance of\
  \ my footing...perhaps a sign or a place I'd seen before. But nothing resonated.\
  \ Everything felt so new and so ethereal, as if I really was Alice trapped inside\
  \ the looking glass. The streets were narrow, lined with stone towered walls and\
  \ bright pops of red carnations. I traced the tips of the architecture with my eyes\
  \ until it broke and a familiar blue replaced it. I looked ahead in the courtyard\
  \ at a place I'd seen only in pictures...a fierce red gate marked with a lion.\n\
  \  \"Puerta Del Leon,\" a voice said behind me.\n   I turned to the man, he was\
  \ short and in his seventies, but he had a kind face and his hands were stained\
  \ with splotches of paint. His art was lined along a windowsill, an easel standing\
  \ nearby in case of sudden inspiration.  \n  \"Si, es muy espectacular,\" I replied\
  \ in my obviously american accent. \n   He smiled as he switched into English, going\
  \ through some of the history of the Alcazar of Seville. I found out his name was\
  \ Roberto and he was born and raised in Seville, a painter all his life. He'd thought\
  \ about leaving once in his early twenties but when it came down to it his heart\
  \ just couldn't bare it. And he'd fallen in love. \n   \"Esta es Rosalina,\" he\
  \ said as he held up a portrait. She was beautiful and radiant, sitting on a chair\
  \ near a window...her gaze somewhere far off. They'd been together for almost forty\
  \ years, everyday much like the one before it. Full of love, art, music, and laughter.\
  \ \n   I stood there looking at Roberto and his art, soaking up the December sun\
  \ and all he had to say. I'd spent most of my life searching for a way out. A way\
  \ to get out of the stagnant place I'd grown up and apart from. I was always dreaming\
  \ about what was around the corner that I never stopped to look behind me at all\
  \ the things I'd learned from and shaped me. But here was Roberto, in the only place\
  \ he'd ever wanted to be, happy, smiling, and lending his knowledge to a girl, quite\
  \ far from home, who may of needed it the most. \n    I thanked him for his time\
  \ and his words, promising I'd be back tomorrow to interview him for my documentary\
  \ project. And he thanked me for listening and sent me on my way with some much\
  \ needed directions. I learned that although I have a heart that will always crave\
  \ adventure, sometimes I need to find the beauty in the now. The very malleable,\
  \ spectacular now."
