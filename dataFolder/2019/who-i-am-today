Text: "Imagine being eight years old. \n\nYou have moved cities a few times, always\
  \ to places where others looked nothing like you, but you didn't know the difference.\
  \ You wondered why your skin wasn't like most of your friends, why you sometimes\
  \ felt out of place, why you never understood the stories mom and dad told about\
  \ 'back home'. You knew they were from a far-off land across the world, a land that\
  \ you never spoke about or acknowledged, a land that your classmates didn't recognize.\
  \ A land that grandma and grandpa would disappear to once a year, a land with spicy\
  \ food, princess-like outfits, mom's favourite movies, and dad's favourite songs.\
  \ A land called 'India'. \n\nIt is a warm day on the West Coast of Canada, and you\
  \ are standing at the airport with your cousins, aunt, and uncle, waving goodbye\
  \ to mom and dad. You don't quite understand where you're going or what for, but\
  \ your eldest cousin seems thrilled and the giant diamond on her finger might be\
  \ the reason why. At least you get to miss a few weeks of school! \n\nAs you get\
  \ off the plane, the first thing you notice is... the heat. Your skin has never\
  \ felt this way, simultaneously wet and dry, the musty yet sweet midnight air filling\
  \ your nostrils. You heart is racing as people speak languages you don't understand,\
  \ and you grip your cousin's hand harder. You're sleepy but excited, and as you\
  \ get picked up from the airport your uncle says, \"Welcome to Mumbai! The city\
  \ that never sleeps.\" \n\nOn the drive from the airport to your mother and uncle's\
  \ childhood flat, you see a teenaged boy with no shoes and torn clothes on the roadside.\
  \ He has a stick tied to a single shoe over a tree, which he is using to amuse a\
  \ puppy. He laughs freely as the puppy licks him, and this memory is easily retrievable\
  \ fourteen years later.\n\nOutside the flat, there are banana trees! You didn't\
  \ know bananas grew on trees. You quickly notice the lack of air conditioning and\
  \ that everything is made of cement, and you miss home. But you quickly snap out\
  \ of it because you just saw some monkeys cross the street. Your cousin and her\
  \ fiancee take you shopping (in a rickshaw), to the beach (ocean water can be warm?),\
  \ to get ice cream (well, melon-flavoured Kulfi), and to a movie (they show Bollywood\
  \ in theatres here!). Everyone around you is a different shade of brown, wearing\
  \ the elaborate outfits you only wear to special occasions, hustling and bustling\
  \ through the city, jumping onto the backs of busses as they drive away, only stopping\
  \ ceremoniously for decorated cows. Some of the stereotypes hold true. \n\nThe following\
  \ days consist of vibrant parties, heat boils, baby goats and calfs, family visits,\
  \ pool adventures, dehydration, making friends, and watching Indian cartoons. On\
  \ your way out of the city to visit the rural farms, you see a scene that shapes\
  \ your life forever. A little girl about your age stands on the island between two\
  \ major roadways, her face covered in dirt and her hair messy. Her left arm has\
  \ been amputated, and strapped around her in a sling is a baby. Holding her only\
  \ hand is a toddler about 2 years of age. You make eye contact with her, but the\
  \ car begins moving again. Girls like her are not uncommon here. \n\nThis memory\
  \ will inspire you to start volunteering and dedicate much of your time to service\
  \ and philanthropy, and to cultivate a career in healthcare. This is my travel story.\
  \ \n\nI was eight years old when I learned the precious value of travelling. I was\
  \ immersed in a culture that felt like home, but was so different from my own. I\
  \ played with wild animals and saw historic temples. I made friends and met family\
  \ that taught me about my heritage, showing me how people can be from anywhere but\
  \ still share so much. I saw the devastating depths of poverty. \n\nIn India, I\
  \ didn't expect to find a deep sense of gratitude for the life I have been given.\
  \ But I did, and I carry it always."
