Text: "Egypt can seem intimidating, especially if you don't speak a bit of Arabic.\
  \ Which is why I chose it as my destination to visit. I assumed I was a well seasoned\
  \ traveller and nothing would stop me. Unfortunately if you don't know anyone, don't\
  \ know the language, and are shy with how you speak, you may have some difficulties.\
  \ \nThat day I had chosen to go to Giza. I googled how to get there from the metro,\
  \ and with my vague idea on what I needed to do, I left the safety of my hostel.\
  \ I arrived at the Giza station completely confused. Do I take the bus across the\
  \ street? How do I pay? Which agency do I go to in order to see the pyramids up\
  \ close? I must've looked really lost when an elderly man approached me. Tiny and\
  \ hunched over, he spoke to me in Arabic. I was so confused until he pointed to\
  \ his wrist, so I assumed he wanted to know the time. I showed him my phone since\
  \ I have no idea how to say numbers in Arabic. He asked me in broken English where\
  \ I was from. I told the man I was American. He then asked where I was headed to,\
  \ which I replied with, \"The pyramids!\" With luck he said his home was in the\
  \ same district, and that he would let me accompany him to the closest agency. I\
  \ thought at first, this could be a scam and he could take me to a friend that would\
  \ charge me double the price, but at that moment I was just desperate for any help\
  \ I could get.\nWe started our journey cramming ourselves into a minivan of strangers,\
  \ each paying the driver a set amount. I had money but my guide refused to let me\
  \ pay and paid for me. As we arrived to a stop the man said was his, we got off\
  \ and now faced the terror that is Cairo traffic. He assured me we we'd be safe,\
  \ grabbed my arm and dashed across the street. We approached a golf cart looking\
  \ vehicle. incredibly small and I assumed my guide was joking when he said this\
  \ is what we'd be taking. My thoughts were wrong, as he told me to hop in. We sped\
  \ by the traffic, down streets with donkeys pulling carriages and kids playing in\
  \ alley. As we drove by, the man asked if I wanted to come by for tea after the\
  \ tour. I agreed to, but asked him why he was being so hospitable. He told me that\
  \ he had a son who studied in Sharm el Sheikh in the Sinai and that I looked almost\
  \ identical to him. I was super honored and felt really ashamed to have thought\
  \ such questionable things about him at the start of the journey. As we arrived,\
  \ he found me a tour agency, spoke and sent me off. The tour guides told me that\
  \ the man had referred to me as his son, and that they were to treat me well. To\
  \ this day, I am still grateful for the journey I went on with this man, and I am\
  \ thankful to have had his help. I tell this story to all my new friends in hopes\
  \ that one day they visit Egypt and have an amazing experience like I did."
