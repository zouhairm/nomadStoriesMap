Text: "Standing on a plateau at 2000m above ground, we looked down at the 2-hour exhausting\
  \ trail we had just trekked. An ascent almost immediately on exiting the car park.\
  \ Anyone who has trekked in the rugged terrains of U.A.E. will know that trails\
  \ are never clearly marked.\n\nWe referenced our maps. Looking to the horizon ahead,\
  \ it looked tiring with no end in sight, but conquerable. Walking on ahead, the\
  \ trail would end with a 90-minute cab ride back to our car. Alternatively, we turn\
  \ back at this point, accomplishing a 4-hour round trek, and head home in daylight.\
  \ Winning scenario. Achievable, but only after clambering the steep descent below.\
  \ Scary but much less adventurous.\n\nSo onward we walked. Into the unknown. Formidable\
  \ yet exciting. The road less traveled. Trail was less patchy but gradually ascended\
  \ again. Around the corner at 6000m, the valley took us on to sheer drops and breath-taking\
  \ cliff hangers.  Adrenaline was pumping. Pulsating reason for not turning back\
  \ at 2000m. Triumph!\n\nAbruptly at 7000m, the euphoria ended. We were surrounded\
  \ by vertical ascents. A few trails attempted ended at dead ends. Fear of being\
  \ stranded now looked real. We split up. My friend eventually found faint trail\
  \ markings. On all fours, we started the scramble. Finally crawling to the top,\
  \ we came to yet another plateau. Vast in size. We seemed to be on the peaks of\
  \ adjoining mountains. We had just passed the 8000m. Referencing our maps showed\
  \ the hike as officially over! A break to replenish and breathe the fresh air.\n\
  \nIt was now 3 pm. We had walked six hours. Faded markings on an ascending trail\
  \ led us on. The path was unexpectedly steep, but this was the last leg, of that\
  \ we were sure. We could hear sounds of the popular zip line. Over the ridge, the\
  \ road became visible \u2013 finally a realizable feat to take us back home.\n\n\
  An unusually quiet road. No vehicles. No taxi services. We geared ourselves to walk\
  \ the supposed 90-minute cab ride. But GPS data (now working) displayed a 15-hour\
  \ walk, down the winding road below! How did other trekkers do this route? We approached\
  \ the zip line office. Surely, they could help. They listened then advised \u201C\
  Get on the next zip liner bus to the closest town, call a cab\u201D.\n\n5 pm. Next\
  \ bus to town an hour\u2019s wait. We had walked eight hours. Desperate, we toyed\
  \ with our fate again. We attempted hitch hiking. It worked. A friendly woman offered\
  \ a ride to the nearest resort. Felt indebted but relieved. But that was short-lived.\
  \ I awoke to a barrage of incessant questions, an avid interest in our bravery,\
  \ stupidity, fitness level, journey choice and lives in general, she drove with\
  \ head craned into the rear-view, dangerously maneuvering to edges of the mountain\
  \ winds, at speed. \n\nAnd then the inevitable. A police siren. They wanted IDs.\
  \ While she fumbled to find hers, they checked ours. I recognized one of them from\
  \ the zip line park. Had they followed us? Did they think we were up to no good?\
  \ They asked her to step out, pointing to her bonnet said, \u201Cwe have a report\
  \ of a hit and run on this car\u201D. My heart sank. Of all the risks. \n\nAfter\
  \ some more interrogation, they let her go. We were on our way again. Discussing\
  \ the incident at first and then back to cross-examining us. But we never made it\
  \ to the promised resort. She dropped us at a lay by off the highway. In the middle\
  \ of nowhere. Two dodgy looking stores, neither of whose help was forthcoming. No\
  \ cabs in sight. It was now dark. Not many streetlights. Phones without batteries.\
  \ Now truly off the beaten track. And nervous. At that moment, a police car drove\
  \ by. The same car. He listened to our story, smiled, and told us his. He had followed\
  \ us from the zip line office. He ordered a cab ensuring our safety.\n\nLessons\
  \ learnt that day; sustenance for a hike is not enough. Prepare, travel in numbers\
  \ if possible, own a spare battery, study the route and trust the police. Leap into\
  \ the unknown but really know your journey."
