Text: "After my dinner around nine at the hotel, which by the way served some of the\
  \ best curries I had ever tasted, I decided to take a walk. As I strolled along\
  \ the neatly designed pathways, I couldn\u2019t help but marvel at the makeshift\
  \ \"city\" at Prayagraj. It was temporarily built to host the 50-day long Ardh Kumbh\
  \ Mela, the largest congregation of humanity anywhere on the planet.\n\nLying at\
  \ the Sangam (confluence) of Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati, the place\
  \ did not exist a few months ago and will cease to be in a few weeks. It was symbolic\
  \ of the Vedic notion of the impermanence of this illusory world.\n\nI walked for\
  \ what seemed like an eternity, surveying in my mind the vast expanse of the Indic\
  \ civilisation. From the Indus Valley\u2019s merchant-dominated economy to the Mughal\
  \ emperors, from Buddha\u2019s renunciation to Kalidas\u2019 lyrical extravagance,\
  \ Kumbh also represented the confluence of India\u2019s turbulent history and its\
  \ hopeful future.\n\nLost in thought, I walked and walked without stopping for a\
  \ conversation with a stranger or to behold a sight for longer. I\u2019m not quite\
  \ sure how long this lasted, but then a bizarre feeling crept in me. I stopped and\
  \ looked around but couldn\u2019t recognise where I was or how I landed there. The\
  \ bustling \u2018crowd\u2019 of the city was also missing here.\n\nAs I tried to\
  \ focus my senses to pick a cue on my situation, I heard strange voices, albeit\
  \ faintly. As I walked in the direction of the sounds, the muddled voices clarified\
  \ themselves into hymn chants. A little further ahead, I saw groups of almost-naked\
  \ loin-clothed and ash-covered men engaged in some esoteric ritual! With long hair\
  \ tied up in knots, groups of them were squatting around individual fires in a semi-circle,\
  \ with a deity placed ahead of them. \n\nWhile some Aghoris were violently ringing\
  \ brass bells with their hands, others let their hair loose to perform the Tandav,\
  \ the cosmic dance. Also, a nasty smell permeated the air, like the one in a graveyard.\
  \ \n\nAnd then it dawned on me! These naked men were Aghoris! \n\nSuddenly a sense\
  \ of dread took over me. Myths of all kinds\u2014\u200Acannibals, insane, blood-thirsty,\
  \ social outcasts\u200A, misguided ascetics\u2014 that I had heard about them over\
  \ the years flooded my mind. Their alleged practices had always fascinated me to\
  \ no end.\n\nBut now that I was in such proximity to them, I wanted to get away\
  \ as soon as I could. The entire scene unfolding in front me made me fearful.\n\n\
  No, I was not afraid of being killed by them. Aghoris do not kill with the intention\
  \ to eat. They only consume the already-dead human flesh with the sole purpose of\
  \ realising the non-duality (Advaita) of this world by transcending social taboos.\n\
  \nIt was surprising, even relieving too, that none of the Aghoris had noticed me\
  \ standing there at the edge of the perimeter. I knew I would soon be noticed and\
  \ had to make a move quick. But I couldn\u2019t!\n\nThough I was repulsed by everything\
  \ around me in that place, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to turn around and walk\
  \ back to my tent. I was bewitched! The spirited fire, the smoke, the swerving undernourished\
  \ bodies, the hymns and the still waters of Ganga all made a very potent combination.\n\
  \nBut deep down I knew why I was still waiting there. I had to witness cannibalism.\
  \ To stand testimony to the nauseating act of a human eating another dead man\u2019\
  s flesh. Neither then nor now do I fully comprehend this desire. It is a part of\
  \ the human psyche that can\u2019t be wished away. It is similar to why blood-filled\
  \ wisdom teeth removal videos on YouTube garner millions of views. It was nothing\
  \ more than a dark fantasy which brings a sense of convoluted satisfaction.\n\n\
  I waited for a few more minutes and then it happened! In one of the groups, perhaps\
  \ the head Aghori himself took the wraps off a piece of flesh, scrapped some human\
  \ meat with his long nails and swallowed a handful.\n\nWhile the other Aghoris around\
  \ him erupted in joy, so did I."
