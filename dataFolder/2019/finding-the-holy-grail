Text: "The interior of Valencia Cathedral was an elaborate splash of faded primary\
  \ colors that chortled, \u201CTourist trap!\u201D Within these hues, the usually\
  \ somber depictions of the Stations of the Cross became garish, bringing to mind\
  \ long ago Catholic school lessons of the evils of idolatry. The entire scene was\
  \ a good backdrop for a selfie: the kind taken to prove one has left not just the\
  \ house but the country. It would not be a proper, photographic commemoration of\
  \ a visit to the alleged Holy Grail. \n\n\tNevertheless, the unsettling gaudiness\
  \ of the room was preferable to the oppressive summer heat outside of the walls.\
  \ While looking for the least obtrusive visual in the room, I noticed an archway.\
  \ On the other side was only shadows. Every other visitor to the cathedral passed\
  \ this entry, like it was some sort of magic portal that only I could perceive.\
  \ As if we were fated to encounter each other, I weaved seamlessly among the other\
  \ tourists until I found myself in a small chapel. \n\n\tDespite the lack of light\
  \ and ornament, the room felt peaceful. Entering felt very much like coming home\
  \ after working overtime for a graveyard shift, when one  immediately flings off\
  \ shoes and jacket. There was a coolness in the air that was borne from no apparent\
  \ source. The exaggerated gasps and exclamations from the main part of the chapel\
  \ were muted in this room where the sole ornamentation was an alcove protected by\
  \ shatterproof glass and a rope barricade. I sat in a pew towards the back, where\
  \ my reverie was disturbed by a hushed whisper containing true awe. \n\n\t\u201C\
  Is that it?\u201D a woman asked her companion in a voice that could have been the\
  \ wind through blades of grass. \u201CI think that\u2019s it!\u201D\n\n\tHer companion\
  \ approached the roped-off area, leaning to peer at the descriptive plate beneath\
  \ the object. There were more whispers that I couldn\u2019t make out, but bore the\
  \ energy of a child waking up on Christmas morning. The voice of a tour guide gave\
  \ an introduction in Spanish, followed by an English translation. My attention was\
  \ riveted only by the very last words: \u201CAnd this\u2026is where we keep the\
  \ Holy Grail.\u201D\n\n\tThere were no oohs or ahs over this information. The group\
  \ piled as close to the display as was allowed, some taking pictures without a flash.\
  \ I approached only after the last member of the tour filed out, wondering what\
  \ I would see. The image of the alleged Grail was not impressive enough to linger\
  \ in my memory, and the picture I attempted was too blurry to be worth keeping.\
  \ Even at that moment, I remember feeling underwhelmed by the sight, but also thinking\
  \ that maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 there was something special about the gold\
  \ toned chalice. After all, without knowing that it rested in this area, I had felt\
  \ a greater sense of ease than I had ever known. \n\n\tWould I recommend this as\
  \ a must-see? No, it\u2019s not for everyone. The hardened cynic can better spend\
  \ his or her time in one of the many wonderful eateries or cafes in the surrounding\
  \ area. For the person who would like to hope that there is something more in this\
  \ world than what is obvious to the eye, then the small, unobtrusive room is worth\
  \ a measure of contemplation."
