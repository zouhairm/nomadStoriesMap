Text: "The next 5am of last exam. I was about to leave the home to carry out the plan\
  \ which I had been thinking for a long time. To go to the Lago di Bilancino by bike\
  \ which is 35km far away from Florence and spend a night there in my tent. Could\
  \ I attained? Well, still I really can not decide whether or not. A little bit help\
  \  from my reader would be great. \nPART 1\nIt was still dark. I took my backpack\
  \ which was full of energetic foods and drinks, closed the door quietly in order\
  \ not to wake up my roommate who could not keep laughing at me when I said I am\
  \ going to go to Lago di Bilancino.  Because the lake is situated on a hill of a\
  \ mountain and to go there by bike is a work of a master.\nI went down where we\
  \ were used to keep our bicycles in the yard of the university residence Cipressino,\
  \ unlocked my bike and started pedaling. \nI always use google map when I travel,\
  \ so this time. But the main difference of this time was travelling without internet.\
  \ It was time to top up my internet but i did not.  Because this time I wanted to\
  \ stay by myself away from my social accounts that I was addicted, still I am. So\
  \ the previous day I saved whole route from home to the lake. \nThe first hour on\
  \ the way was so easy. There was supposed to be a thin way that deviates from the\
  \ main road. I do not know how but somehow I missed that way and could not find\
  \ on the map. The google map didn\u2019t work properly, it needed to be refreshed.\
  \ At 6am there was no shops, no restaurants no people to ask for Wi-Fi or hotspot.\
  \ You can not imagine how I was ruined. But I am not kind of person who quit easily.\
  \ I kept going with hope to find alternative way. There must be another, that one\
  \ can not be the only way to get to the lake. \n10-15 minutes cycling took me a\
  \ circle in Prato. All the way I was looking for a sign to go lake but did not find.\
  \ Suddenly I glimpsed a sign: 73 km to Pisa. Umm, why not? I left home to make a\
  \ story, to fulfill my love with nature. So what is the matter if I change the destination\
  \ from 35km far away lake to 80km Pisa? I made a decision: I am going to go to Pisa.!\n\
  \nPart 2.\nIt took about six hours to get to Pisa. But for sure it was worth it.\
  \ Those six hours have also their own rich in content stories which I will talk\
  \ later in detailed. For example strong rain made me stop and to find a place to\
  \ wait until it was finished. The place I found was a church and as a muslim boy\
  \ my meaningful chat with priest. After rain stopped he saw me off and wished me\
  \ good luck. \nAfter all I finally arrived in Pisa about 12. When someone says Pisa\
  \ the first thing comes to our mind is of course The Leaning Tower.  As you can\
  \ guess the first think I did was to take a selfie and share it on my instagram.\
  \ Although I wanted to stay away from social accounts, that time could not keep\
  \ myself  to share the moment with my friends. I found public Wi-Fi, connected and\
  \ fatto. It didn\u2019t  take so much from sharing the photo to receive the first\
  \ phone call. And what I heard was what I wanted to hear : \u201CDude, are you kidding\
  \ me?!\u201D\nStill that photo is the most liked picture among my 794 posts. I will\
  \ keep you interested about how I spent time there, how I came back, what happened.\
  \ But as I asked before what I want is to know whether or not I attained my plan.\
  \ Or did I do more or less? \nDecide yourself."
