Text: "When I was growing up, I told my mother that I was going to be a writer. When\
  \ I started college, I thought that dream had slipped through my fingers. My writers\u2019\
  \ block had grown roots that spun through my wrists and rode parasitic waves in\
  \ my joints. I had become overwhelmed with the prospective future: becoming a wife,\
  \ maintaining my office job, keeping my laundry unpiled and my body slim. Life was,\
  \ seemingly, going in the right direction, even though my dreams had been set down\
  \ a few blocks back, tied to a post and waiting naively for an undated return.\n\
  But I was broken. \n\nNot in a physical sense, but a mental one. Seven years of\
  \ playing house had left me empty, a vacancy sign hanging on the glossed-over white\
  \ of my eyes in my brand-new apartment in Saint Petersburg, Florida. We had just\
  \ signed the lease less than a month before. I was supposed to be happy.\nAnd then\
  \ it all happened: my cat died, my younger brother went to jail, my identity was\
  \ stolen, he broke off our engagement over a text. That, in conjunction with my\
  \ deceased father, alcoholic mother, miserable job and lack of hobbies, left me\
  \ empty. \n\nBroken.\n\nI was left with a choice: I could stay in the apartment\
  \ that we had cried over, working at a job I hated, facing friends that were ultimately\
  \ more his than mine. I could continue nourishing the role of \u2018modern housewife\u2019\
  , eating shitty food and downing a bottle of wine each night, falling in the footsteps\
  \ of my stumbling, drowning mother. \n\nOr I could pack up and leave. And so, I\
  \ did. \n\nI set out on a trek to car camp throughout the entire United States,\
  \ living in a new state each year. I scoured New Orleans, Phoenix, Joshua Tree,\
  \ Asheville, and now Brooklyn, all solo. I have a gold Prius named Junebug and a\
  \ best friend named Tub. I\u2019ve lived out of my car, peed in a cup while driving\
  \ sixty down I-10, started meditating daily and once screamed at the universe with\
  \ a homeless man named Josh who \u201Cjust needed someone to listen to his pain\u201D\
  . Travel became my life. Slowly, and over the course of years, I\u2019ve gotten\
  \ over my fear of being alone. I no longer tremble at the thought of facing new\
  \ social situations, and I\u2019ve started dreaming bigger than the girl I once\
  \ was could ever imagine. \n\nI\u2019d love to tour Europe. I\u2019d love to live\
  \ in Stockholm, write documentaries about Elephant poaching in Africa, teach English\
  \ to children in the Philippines. I want break down the science of travel in an\
  \ approachable way for others my age. Travel at a college level was once something\
  \ I never thought I could do, all while taking courses. To my surprise, neither\
  \ did my friends. But here I am, years later, living in a shoebox apartment in Brooklyn,\
  \ New York, planning my next move and eating folded pizza in twenty-degree weather\
  \ like its ritual.\n\nI can\u2019t guarantee that my travel story is any bigger\
  \ or more enlightening than the next. But what I can guarantee is that I don\u2019\
  t just want to see the world: I want to write in such a way that it allows others\u2019\
  \ to experience it just as vibrantly as I am, and with just as much passion."
