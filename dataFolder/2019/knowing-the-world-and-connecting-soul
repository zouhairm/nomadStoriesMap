Text: Knowing the world and connecting soul is the title i thought for this scholarship.I
  am just a simple human being 24,newly married  who is not perfect with grammars
  and doesn't have any experience in writing jobs except being part of school journalism
  back in high school. I thought of this title based on my religious beliefs about
  God, and curiousity about the world and people in it. In my beliefs this scholarship
  program will help me connect with the world, the people, understand life and hear
  all the bitter-sweet experiences of people i'll encounter. Knowing the world, is
  part of myself knowing more about the earth and truth in it and maybe just to see
  how wonderful God is, and or just simply to know why i am on earth. Connecting soul,
  is part of me wanting to listen, to connect and to share pure love with people i'll
  encounter. I don't know how i'll do it thinking that there are a lot of people who
  are deserving for this position but this is just part of me eager to know and write
  stories about one's journey.Thought no competences but just passion burning within
  me to make a difference and make great stories to remember. Stories that are true
  and genuinely life experiences. Bitter-sweet life experiences that you can get through
  people and travelling, and who knows to help in ways i can possibly do and share
  smiles too. That's right, all of this are the reasons why I want to be part of this
  journey, just love ,share love and smiles and write their stories.
