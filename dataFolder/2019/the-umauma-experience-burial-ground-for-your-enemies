Text: "I stumbled on the peace garden in Hilo, Hawaii completely on accident. On the\
  \ way back from seeing Umauma Falls, I saw a humongous, completely untouched, and\
  \ gorgeously woven spider's web. I got closer to admire the handy work of nature's\
  \ best quilters. As I unfocused my eyes off the web, I noticed a peace garden about\
  \ 20 feet away from the web. Curiosity led me farther.\n\nBefore delving too deep\
  \ into what I saw at Umauma Falls, let me give you a little background on what I\
  \ was going through at the time.\n\nI'm about to get too personal, so consider yourself\
  \ warned.\n\nRecently, I gave birth to my second child. To put it nicely, healing\
  \ and recovery have been...a\_total mess. The short of it includes 5 rounds of antibiotics,\
  \ pelvic surgery, rounds of various pills that do who knows what, and strange creams\
  \ for places that should never need cream. TMI? Don't say I didn't warn you approximately\
  \ one paragraph ago.\n\nIn an effort to give my post-partum body and heart a break,\
  \ my husband and I packed up my\_mountains of drugs\_(thankfully, I didn't get\_\
  Broken Down Palace-ed), and flew to Hawaii. Umauma Falls was our first stop.\n\n\
  When I moved past the spider's web, I entered an inconspicuous peace garden. I saw\
  \ 9 tombstones, all labeled with a different \"enemy.\" For example, the enemy of\_\
  \"fear\" was on one grave, the enemy of \"anger\" on another, and \"harmful beliefs\"\
  \ on another, etc.\n\nThat's when I saw my enemy. Enemy #9: Illness and Disease.\n\
  \nAs I contemplated everything that I'd been through the past 3 months,\_feelings\
  \ flood-gated out of me and I sobbed. Immediately, I knew this enemy burial ground\
  \ was here for a reason. It\_was my time to bury\_the enemy that was holding me\
  \ captive.\n\nThe instructions near the graves state to dig a hole and take the\
  \ negative energy from your heart. Then, you bury the negative energy while saying\_\
  \"enemy (fill in the blank with your enemy), you are now destroyed and I bury you\
  \ here never to be my enemy again.\"\n\nI followed the instructions. I thought about\
  \ the weekly poking and prodding during blood work, the invasive pelvic exams, the\
  \ time spent on cold tables in Radiology rooms, the bureaucracy that is the medical\
  \ and insurance world, the side-effects from medication, the postpartum depression--the\
  \ pain.\n\nI took it from my heart. Destroyed it.\_Buried it. Left it in Hawaii\
  \ forever.\n\nI'm not naive enough to believe that this action healed me forever.\
  \ Modern medicine will continue to be part of my journey. But, stumbling upon this\
  \ peace journey did something for me I desperately needed. It gave me time to reflect\
  \ on\_what I've been through and to realize I deserve to heal. This moment of reflection\_\
  fostered an overwhelming sense of peace and I felt renewed, ready to bury more enemies.\n\
  \nSo, I continued.\n\nI buried: stress from being overwhelmed by daily life, fear\
  \ I am not a good enough mother, destructive habits of self-loathing my new mom\
  \ bod, illness and disease (once again for good measure), and all other known and\
  \ unknown enemies of the spirit.\n\nMy unplanned time in the peace garden of Umauma\
  \ Falls gave me strength. I'm grateful for travel--for opportunities to bury old\
  \ enemies and come to healthy realizations that make life easier."
