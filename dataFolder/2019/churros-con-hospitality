Text: "In Spain in 2008, i fell in love. I fell in love, not in the boy meets girl\
  \ traditional sense, but the girl meets delicious food and a blanket of warmth and\
  \ hospitality. The people I was staying with taught me the beautifully sultry language\
  \ of Spanish and that eating supper at 10 at night and having a siesta (nap) is\
  \ totally and perfectly acceptable and normal during the day. I stayed for a total\
  \ of three months and if it weren\u2019t for my being so young and on my own I would\
  \ have stayed. I decided that my finger on the capture button of my camera was my\
  \ best friend as I walked along Avenida de Albert Einstein in Gijon snapping photos\
  \ of huge trees that looked like giant pineapples and buildings older than I had\
  \ ever seen before. I stumbled across a cappuccino bar and even the cups were of\
  \ exquisite quality gold trimmed and frothy. I stood out like a sore thumb with\
  \ my red hair and light skin and eyes. I met a group of Spaniards that were so warm\
  \ and friendly and were so interested in learning more English they treated me like\
  \ I was long lost family. I felt whole for the first time in my life. And I keep\
  \ those memories in my heart forever."
