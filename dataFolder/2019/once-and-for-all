Text: "It is said that Para\xEDba is the place where the sun rises first in Brazil\
  \ and I believe because there are no most sacred mornings, there is no brighter\
  \ sun.\nI traveled to the capital Jo\xE3o Pessoa on a rainy Thursday in March, I\
  \ took the bus and went, I saw 6 hours and slept the whole trip. I arrived about\
  \ 5 in the morning and was amazed at that huge shed full of people coming and going\
  \ all graced by the smell of the coffee, strong and sweet to the measure. I went\
  \ straight to the bathroom, I took a delicious bath in social clothes, I went to\
  \ a business meeting, I had that delicious coffee, I asked for a taxi and I went\
  \ to the Ouro Branco Hotel, right on the beach of Cabo Branco. I went into the meeting,\
  \ sat down, talked to some people, exchanged ideas, gave opinions, ate lunch, covered\
  \ social assistance issues during the afternoon and finally after a long tiring\
  \ but promising day, we returned to the rooms. She was alone. There was a double\
  \ bed, TV, freezer with drinks and a huge window overlooking the Atlantic Ocean,\
  \ unruly, enthralling and immensely beautiful. The moon rose between silver and\
  \ giant clouds, wet with the uncrutable waves accompanied by small stars.I decided\
  \ to go on the beach full of the wishes of a whole world and while I was walking\
  \ I watched everything and everyone, some solitary and empty, others full enough\
  \ not to fit."
