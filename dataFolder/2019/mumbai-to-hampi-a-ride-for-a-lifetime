Text: "Some background story- My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate New Years in\
  \ a different way. And so, it happened! We rode about 700kms leaving our hometown\
  \ and the year behind to an unknown land only to discover \"hey, this looks like\
  \ the sets of The Flinstones\". Here's how it rolled..\n\nEnter: 2019\n\nIf Mumbai\
  \ and Hampi had something common at that point, it would be us waking up 1. Hung\
  \ over and 2. Beside each other \nDay 1,2,3,4 and 5 felt like an eternity yet just\
  \ 1 long eventful and memorable day. In a whirlwind of memories, let me catch a\
  \ few-\nDay 1- J\u2019s and Daze- This day passed by passing a couple of J\u2019\
  s, aimlessly walking through the historic lanes, entertaining ourselves in an effort\
  \ to stay up till morning to welcome our dearest \u2018Da\u2019.\nDay 2-Fam and\
  \ Jam- We suddenly became 3 when our long lost friend decided to spend \u2018high\u2019\
  \ quality time with us. We chilled at the lake, jammed and watched other pros jam.\
  \ It was nice meeting Stevie Wond..-Richmond.\nDay 3-Recovery day- We basically\
  \ did alooot of nothing and chill. \nDay 4- Scarlet (the bike's) resurrection- We\
  \ rode to Monkey Temple, walked 575 steps up to a breathtaking (literally) view\
  \ that overlooked Hampi. Cruised around the streets some more and later felt the\
  \ grave blues as we were trying to mentally prepare ourselves for..\nDay 5- :\u201D\
  ( - The day everything was about to turn into a waterglobe of live memories. The\
  \ melancholy was and is still REAL. The only comforting thing right now? I close\
  \ my eyes and I\u2019m in Hampi."
