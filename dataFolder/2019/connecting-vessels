Text: "\" love to read books,\" she said. \"I am free to imagine things\"\n\"And I\
  \ love flowers! I would open up a flower shop if I could. I\u2019ve loved flowers\
  \ since I was a little\ngirl,\u201D another interrupted.As the desert sun dazzled\
  \ through the palm roof, I sat on the sand and felt it shimmer and coalesce\nover\
  \ my skin. After three weeks of being covered in sand, it was now part of my everyday\
  \ ensemble.\nPedras douradas, golden rocks, I began to call it. The magical quality\
  \ of it felt apt to me, for I was in\nawe of the way these women\u2019s eyes glistened\
  \ as they told me of their dreams and triumphs.\nWere these the same women I had\
  \ met just three weeks ago? I wondered. They had changed from\nshy and silent to\
  \ outspoken. As we sat there, knitted together, they shared their varied opinions\
  \ on\nlove, men, society, Sudanese culture, Islam. I realized, through these deep\
  \ and open conversations\nwith the village women, that we were all playing a tune\
  \ that society had orchestrated for us as\nwomen. Our melody was the stories we\
  \ shared with one another.\nAs a young woman who recently returned to her homeland,\
  \  never did I think I was quick to be bold and start travelling within Sudan after\
  \ being away for nine years. I was a string of  various vessels a bit Swiss, Canadian,\
  \ Brazilian but my heart; my core  I know it to be Sudanese. I wondered often if\
  \ that would show through the way I spoke to the locals and connected with them.The\
  \ location this time was a remote northern province, home to one of Sudan\u2019\
  s most illustrious literary figures, the novelist Tayeb Salih.My main task was to\
  \ encourage the village women to take\npart in workshops initiated by an NGO, to\
  \ make sure their voices were heard, and to understand their challenges so we could\
  \ find ways to support them. But to my dismay, and without realizing it, I found\
  \ I had embarked on a journey of my own that led me to a deep self-evaluation, to\
  \ building stronger human connections, and to reflections on what it means to be\
  \ the female traveler. Unlike most young women from my country, I have had the humbling\
  \ privilege to experience other\ncultures, to learn new languages, and to see something\
  \ of what makes the world the way it is today.\nI\u2019m used to being the foreigner.\
  \ I\u2019d asked them about their aspirations for themselves, for their\nchildren,\
  \ and for society \u2013 not to change them, but simply to listen. We\u2019d created\
  \ strong bonds of\nfriendship, to the point where they\u2019d ask me about my love\
  \ life. Now  this question is anything but\nunusual, as it\u2019s the standard conversation\
  \ with every Sudanese khaltu (auntie). But the remarks they\nmade afterwards made\
  \ me reflect on my own experiences in a way I hadn\u2019t before. They told me\n\
  that, in their eyes, I didn\u2019t seem to have many challenges. After all, I was\
  \ a young woman who was\nfree to travel around Sudan, to explore the outside world,\
  \ with no husband to answer to and a\nfather who had instilled her with confidence.\
  \ It had left me with a great sense of\nresponsibility to amplify their voices,\
  \ to help young girls believe in endless possibilities, to keep\nlistening to their\
  \ beautiful, often tragic stories that sometimes kept me up at night.\nMy time in\
  \ the village had become a place of connection and of storytelling, as we created\
  \ beautiful handmade pieces of fabric that expressed their thoughts and feelings\
  \ and knitted them together into\na work of art. I\u2019d talked about Africa, about\
  \ getting away from the misconceptions and stereotypes\nabout our great continent.One\
  \ of my greatest pleasure about travelling  is the idea of meeting new people the\
  \ thought that a merely two hours ago I didn't know this certain person existed\
  \ to  then have then created a bond through the stories shared. The food, architecture\
  \ and history of a new place can always be rather exciting. Yet what fills me the\
  \ most is knowing that humanity lies everywhere, that no matter our location we\
  \ all want to feel and be connected."
