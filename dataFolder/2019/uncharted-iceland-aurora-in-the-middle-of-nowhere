Text: "You know, I've always been that kind of people, who try to find a lot of information\
  \ about a new city or place long before arrival. Where to eat, where to stay at\
  \ night, where to find the bus, how much will costs train tickets for 3 days, where\
  \ is the nearest and largest supermarket (and that discounts they have) and this\
  \ kind of stuff. Eventually, when you\u2019ve finally come to that place \u2014\
  \ nothing can surprise you. And this is horrible. Moreover, I think it\u2019s the\
  \ worst thing, which can happen to you during the travel. No new impressions. \n\
  \nThis I-need-to-know-everything staff can really screw up your trip. Understand\
  \ me right. I don\u2019t say that you don\u2019t need to make some research before\
  \ traveling. You have to. But only the basic things: hotel address and local currency.\
  \ Ok, you can check some art places and points with early-bird coffee lovers if\
  \ you want. That\u2019s all. Leave some space to imagination and fluke. \n\n That\u2019\
  s why before my autumn Iceland travel I didn't do any research over the necessary\
  \ information at all. Just booked a few hotels and car in advance. I uploaded offline\
  \ maps right in the airport and stepped towards the unknown. \n\nAnd you know what?\
  \ That was the most amazing trip I\u2019ve ever had. I don\u2019t even always put\
  \ a point on the map \u2014 just driven, listened to my intuition and watched, how\
  \ Iceland was opening to me from different sides.\n\nI threw black pebbles in raging\
  \ Vik\u2019s waves, ate original skyr on the small parking somewhere in the snowy\
  \ peaks, stood on the edge of the world on the western fjords and fell asleep, seeing\
  \ bald mountain ranges from the window. I knew, that tomorrow will be a new day\
  \ and I have to enjoy it all without tedious planning and wasted nervous. So I did.\
  \ That\u2019s made this Iceland trip so magical and unforgettable. \n\nI want to\
  \ tell you a little more about one moment, that will stay in my memory till death.\
  \ On the late evening on the second day, I missed the turn and, finally, lost. I\
  \ rode slowly in the darkness when my headlights lit the big sheep on the road.\
  \ I\u2019m not kidding. This really can happen in Iceland, so, drive carefully.\
  \ Don\u2019t know, which of the two of us was more scared, but sheep ran away to\
  \ the other side, and I had to stop the car for a little break. I\u2019ve turned\
  \ off the lights, opened the door and decided to stretch my tired legs. But when\
  \ I took eyes on the night sky \u2014 I forgot about everything. There was a massive\
  \ green-and-violet Aurora in the sky. It covered almost all the sky and looked like\
  \ goddess hairs. I stood enchanted and lost track of time. Just silently peered\
  \ into the night sky until the northern lights faded away. Certainly, this is one\
  \ of my lovely Iceland memories \u2014 the breathtaking Aurora in the night sky\
  \ somewhere in the mountains. \n\nHope, that this story inspired you. Just try the\
  \ thing, which I call \xABa leap into unknown\xBB and I assure, you\u2019ll not\
  \ be disappointed."
