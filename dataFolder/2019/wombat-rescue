Text: When I lived in Sydney, my mom and dad took a plane from Chile to see me and
  we travelled around Australia for three weeks. After some days in Sydney, we drove
  towards Melbourne in a 3 days road trip. A lot of friends told me it was my place,
  so I was happy to get my first approach to Victoria's region. Enjoying our way through
  the mesmerizing Kosciuszko national park, we saw the "welcome to Victoria" sign.
  We stopped by to take some pictures of it when my father noticed a roadkill next
  to it, but something was moving inside it. We looked closer and it was the arm of
  the breeding trying to come out from the upside-down corpse! We didn't knew what
  it was, but we had to do something, but we were traveling light, so we lacked most
  of the helpful stuff (a knife!), so I took a bag from the car and with plenty of
  patience, we could take the baby animal out. After the birth, we rushed to the closest
  town on the way, Cann River. We entered the first hospital and we met a doctor.
  He told us that the animal was a wombat but he hesitated about it's fate, saying
  that it'd mostly die. Then he told us to hold on for a sec, left to do a phone call
  and after ten minutes came back with a box and a towel on it saying that we should
  keep the animal warm and drive to the next town police station, Osford, where a
  woman was expecting us to take care of it. We did as he said and not only we made
  a woman very happy with the animal, we saved a life in a wonderful unexpected road
  trip adventure!
