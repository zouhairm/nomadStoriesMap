Text: "I am from Kerala in india. I have decided to travel solo around Maharashtra\
  \ which a part of South india. Maharashtra is similar with Kerala by the landscape\
  \ but much bigger than Kerala. I have traveled 10 days arround the State. I prefer\
  \ night time for long travel. So I can sleep inside mini sleeper bus or train and\
  \ reach the destination early morning.. To continue this travel plan I am booked\
  \ a train ticket to mumbai from a station which is near from pune. I have reached\
  \ railway station at 12:00 o' clock midnight.. There is no people in railway station.\
  \ I think most of people in Maharashtra are lived their life in cities.. That might\
  \ be a reason that Mumbai is second largest populated city in the world.. I was\
  \ in a village railway station.so the station was empty.\n  I was so hungry. Unfortunately\
  \ the shops where closed. Only a beverage shop which was going to shutdown. I ask\
  \ them to eat something,they have only drinks and side dish. I brought a soft drink\
  \ and side dish. Which was my dinner in that night.. It was my bad luck that train\
  \ was late by 2 hours.. I felt sleepy. But I had no courage to sleep whilist I have\
  \ one expensive camera in my bag. I don't know about the people around that place.\n\
  \nIt was cold I am sat on a bench in empty station.while a man walk from the dark.\
  \ He comes to me. He was old. He weared old dress. I think he was a daily wage farm\
  \ worker. He has a wrinkled face. He sat on a bench in front of me. I guessed that\
  \ it was his resting place in night. he has a tape recorder it was not working he\
  \ tried to play it.. I had shooted his walks and his actions without irritating\
  \ him. He saw the camera that I have so that might be a reason he thought i am a\
  \ technical person. He gave his tape recorder and asked me to fix it. His request\
  \ was on his native language. I understood it by his actions. I checked that and\
  \ I found he place the battery in wrong end.. I corrected it and played and gave\
  \ back to him. He was happy. By that he place the recorder between us so we both\
  \ can hear. In fact I don't understood that radio it was in his native language.\
  \ After sometime he started talking about his family I can understood from his gesture\
  \ that he have 2 son and a daughter. He asked about mine i show my family picture\
  \ from my phone and tell him about my family in English. We continued that conversation\
  \ after few minutes I realized that he don't  understand English then why  I should\
  \ speak in English.. I continued in my native language and he spoke on his language\
  \ we talked about 1 - 1 : 30 hours. Later train arrived he comes with me and helped\
  \ me to take correct seat. He said bye. It was a good memory.. his appearance helped\
  \ me in many ways... At that Conversation time forgot about sleeping. He gave me\
  \ water.  I understood that language is not needed when people have good heart to\
  \ help each other..."
