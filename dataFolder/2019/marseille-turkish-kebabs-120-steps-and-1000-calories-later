Text: "When I disembarked our cruise liner that morning, I had expected the competing\
  \ scents of lavender and freshly baked croissants to welcome me on France\u2019\
  s southern-most coast.  I was wrong. It did not work out that way. \n\nWhat I did\
  \ not expect to find when I strolled into the Marseille city-centre from the Old\
  \ Port,  was to navigate through a party of demonstrators, protesting against a\
  \ fuel hike!  As a South African passport holder, I felt like joining in solidarity\
  \ given that back home, we too, feel the pinch of fuel price hikes routinely, but\
  \ there were sites to see and the tour bus waits for no man. I soldiered on.   \n\
  \nI was besotted by Marseille even before I arrived. I can thank the late Anthony\
  \ Bourdain\u2019s Parts Unknown for that, when he shared the wonders of Bouillabaisse\
  \ with me through my 52 inch screen at home.  The show accurately depicted the contrast\
  \ of dilapidated buildings metres from the more froth and bubbles atmosphere of\
  \ the city-centre. I'd say that there is something captivating about a city that\
  \ doesn\u2019t try hard (or at all) to be beautiful \u2013 but just is. That is,\
  \ to me, the best way to describe Marseille.  I had, admittedly, na\xEFve expectations\
  \ of Marseille \u2013 I had romanticised the Port city based on the online images\
  \ of cerulean waters and ethereal churches, but it has far more character than that.\
  \  There is a calmness that Marseille imposes on those who wander its streets. It\
  \ felt safe.\n\nGuided by my belly and a nose that had sniffed out something delectable\
  \ within walking distance from the Port, I wandered into a side walk takeaway-cum-cafe\
  \ called Turkish Kebab and Pizza. I did not expect that the best food I\u2019d eat\
  \ in Marseille would be in the form of a Turkish kebab! Succulent pieces of cubed\
  \ chicken in a feather light, crisp, buttery naan marinated in an other-worldly\
  \ creamy sauce with just the right amount of masala to compensate for the bland\
  \ cruise food I\u2019d been eating for days prior. It reminded my taste-buds that\
  \ they were indeed alive and well!  Outstanding! \n\nSatiated, I wandered into a\
  \ street market filled with locally made lavender soap, hand crafted wooden crafts\
  \ and cotton scarfs.  \n\nWhat struck me, as a third-world passport holder, is that\
  \ in this famed first world city, the realities of poverty  were still felt. We\
  \ walked passed the homeless, some speaking languages from the east and it reminded\
  \ me of the headline reports of refugees that fled civil unrest ridden regions like\
  \ Qaraqosh and the like in the east, to  Marseille.  I was far removed from this\
  \ reality when it was on the news \u2013 it  was never that tangible watching from\
  \ afar.     \n\nI spent the day marvelling at the Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde,\
  \ a Catholic church and arguably the best known landmark in Marseille. About a 1000\
  \ calories later having trekked up the carved 120 step stone staircase to the top,\
  \ I was rewarded with a panoramic view of Marseille in all its glory \u2013 the\
  \ view may have been breath-taking but I was panting for a different reason\u2026\
  .    \n\nI had just enough time to admire the giant ferris wheel near the old Port\
  \ and the Monument aux morts d'Orient a little way further before trekking back\
  \ to the ship. It\u2019s a monument to fallen soldiers, specifically a tribute to\
  \ those who lost their lives in the First World War while stationed in eastern regions.\
  \ The monument is epic \u2013 it was architecturally designed to depict victory\
  \ by way of bronze statue of a woman with outstretched arms facing upwards, which\
  \ statue sits under a giant stone arch. It overlooks the Mediterranean sea and it\
  \ is a powerful image. \n\nMy day in Marseille was a world wind of history, culture,\
  \ religion and the best Turkish kebabs I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of tasting!\
  \ My advice to visitors is to grab an opportunity to visit Marseille if it ever\
  \ arises, approach it without any expectations and appreciate it for the charismatic\
  \ mix of what it does have to offer: a culture-rich and historic coastal city, with\
  \ its own brand of magnetism."
