Text: "The worst thing about living in fear is the denial. It\u2019s spoon fed to\
  \ us so early that somewhere along the way fear becomes hard to distinguish from\
  \ routine, our brains clicking shut till its over. Those of us that are the worst\
  \ hit not just live by the book but make it our Bible, an unintelligible multitude\
  \ telling itself that here lies moral ground - direction - the closest thing to\
  \ stability. But what is stability if not glorified stagnation? We fear chaos, saving\
  \ our breath for when we\u2019re in clear ground for god forbid the fumes of a hint\
  \ at change clear the fog in our heads. Somewhere along the way, we stop trying\
  \ to light fire with damp wood and get in line because in some obscure way, that\
  \ seems more rewarding.  Somehow we delude ourselves that the way forward is to\
  \ start marching to one big drum. \n\tBut there comes a time when it\u2019s no longer\
  \ enough. Pavlov\u2019s ringing his stupid bell, you\u2019re drooling but there\u2019\
  s no goddamn food. And those of us stuck, turning and turning in the widening gyre\
  \ the longest, are hit the hardest, so afraid of being ordinary that we work harder\
  \ than most to find some salvation by way of fame or fortune. So afraid of being\
  \ ordinary, we join a legion of all those in the same rung: an extraordinary rung\
  \ of ordinary men who live their now in fear of tomorrow - numbing ourselves in\
  \ the name of work. \nLiving in a town as small and intrusive as mine made stepping\
  \ out of line no less than sin. We prepared every day in advance, some taking each\
  \ step keeping in mind what happens ten years from now. Much like a squirrel storing\
  \ nuts for the approaching winter, but also with a separate store for the next winter.\
  \ And a spare, you know, just in case. \n\tI recorded every day well in advance,\
  \ in ink or graphite, making little room for something new. I directed the action,\
  \ reading off a script I kept in the form of to-do lists, post-its and itineraries.\
  \ But that day, on a train to N\xEEmes, I stood among a half-recognisable group,\
  \ my plans nothing beyond their whims and a crumpled sheet that lay just below my\
  \ palms. And yet, with each giggle, I felt the soreness I had grown accustomed to\
  \ dwindle and disappear. I felt more at home than I ever could so far from it. \
  \ \n\tIt took a few hours and some Doux Champagne to make the crowd familiar to\
  \ me, each line in every face reminiscent of a story, branded with marks and moles\
  \ and scars that stood to tell that here was a rare breed, one of its kind, created\
  \ from myriad experiences, their voices and spirits contingent to their past.  Of\
  \ which one sat across from me at the Jardins de la Fontaine. His face was calm,\
  \ one hand on a pile of cards he had so meticulously arranged. He felt familiar.\
  \ \n\t\u201CTell us something nobody knows about you.\u201D \n\tHis eyelids parted,\
  \ his face stretched in a tight smile. The silence that followed only intrigued\
  \ us all further; we sat there watching him, we sat there in solidarity - waiting.\
  \ \n\tMoments passed with each heartbeat. \n\t\u201CI was afraid.\u201D \n\tHe laid\
  \ a finger on the deck, pushing the first card out of order just so slightly. \t\
  \n\tMeeting him had felt like a visit home after a considerable amount of time ;\
  \ each piece of furniture a reminder of what I\u2019d left behind. Just knowing\
  \ where the glasses were kept. His laugh was all the games I\u2019d played in my\
  \ garden as a child, his gaze like looking out from the terrace as the sun hung\
  \ low behind a wave of mountains.\n\tThe sun hung low behind him. We were familiar.\
  \ \n\tHe laughed. \n\t\u201CI was afraid of dust and dirt. So one time, I went and\
  \ lay on the floor at a subway station. I\u2019m not afraid anymore.\u201D \n\t\
  And yet one breed rarer than most. Just like the wine, replaced over the years by\
  \ a preference for Brut. Here in my hands it lay, years from its days of glory,\
  \ daring to try in all its sweetness."
