Text: "\u201CFirst door on your right. Whatever is left, you can have it.\u201D \n\
  \nWith a nod and a mumbled \u2018thank you\u2019, we dutifully headed straight to\
  \ the dilapidated hatch where the doorman pointed towards, a holdall strewn over\
  \ my shoulder and a fanny pack hanging from my neck. My travel companion, standing\
  \ at a lofty 6ft6, stooped under the low door frame, careful not to bang his head\
  \ in it. \n\nThe peeling bark on the door did little to brace us for the horrors\
  \ within. If the room was an assault on the senses, it was certainly the smell that\
  \ hit the hardest. The smell, a perfect blend of alcohol, weed and piss; two barely\
  \ cool fans scarcely clinging onto the sunken plaster of the ceiling. After travelling\
  \ for almost 24 hours on coaches and ferries, we were exhausted, too weak and past\
  \ caring to complain about our surroundings. We were just grateful for a mattress\
  \ on which to lay our weary bodies. We dropped our bags onto the lower bunks and\
  \ moved cautiously towards the \u2018toilet\u2019 sign at the back of the room.\n\
  \nWary of what may lie within, we nudged the toilet door open. A flock of flies\
  \ swarmed towards us and in doing so revealed a pile of human faeces taking pride\
  \ of place in the centre of the only bathroom we had for the next three days.\n\n\
  Famished, we routinely buckled our fanny packs around our waists and summoned hats\
  \ and sunglasses to our heads and eyes. With all four limbs covered in tiger balm\
  \ and insect repellent, we hastily left the hostel in search of food. It was the\
  \ day before the Full Moon Party. Backpackers and gap year students heaved their\
  \ rucksacks along the road, heading towards their respective hostels; vendors and\
  \ shopkeepers shouting loudly in hope to attract vulnerable customers to their makeshift\
  \ little stalls; locals sitting outside or leaning against their doors, staring\
  \ idly at this seasonal chaos that they have grown accustomed to. \n\nOur only solace\
  \ was our 30p Pad Thai that would greet us again the next day. But for now, we were\
  \ just grateful to be fed. After lunch, we reluctantly trudged back to the hostel\
  \ to unpack before setting off aimlessly to wander around the island, curious about\
  \ the famous party starting in less than 36 hours. \n\n~\n\nWe woke up to the buzzing\
  \ sounds of the island. More cars, more tourists, more empty beer cans lying on\
  \ the sidewalk. After grabbing ourselves some rambutans and fresh coconuts from\
  \ the Big C supermarket across the street, we wandered to a secluded beach on the\
  \ other side of the Koh Phangan, an idyllic retreat from the otherwise hectic island\
  \ before the party. Waves gently settling onto the shore, couples walking hand-in-hand\
  \ along the seafront, friends eagerly gathering around the picnic blankets, dogs\
  \ happily running towards the Frisbees thrown carelessly by their owners. The rejuvenating\
  \ smell of the sea and the tender breeze momentarily transported me far away from\
  \ the overwhelmingly vibrant and crowded reality.\n\n6 pm, we made our way back\
  \ to the hostel, only to find ourselves in a completely transformed location. What\
  \ used to be a simplistic reception with a few beat-up couches had now been replaced\
  \ by several ping pong tables, with alcohol spilt over them and half-naked travellers\
  \ with neon paint drawn all over their bodies. Our hostel was somehow less habitable\
  \ now; it had become an epic nightclub. Staffs, also covered in glow-in-the-dark\
  \ paints, were serving lethal jelly shots, water downed cocktails and those infamously\
  \ vile buckets. These parties were legendary, or so we\u2019d heard. We were ready\
  \ to embrace the \u2018night of our lives\u2019, but right now we were more astounded\
  \ and disorientated, almost fearful of what the next 12 hours were going to be like.\
  \ We started chatting with two English girls, a couple of Australians and another\
  \ English-speaking Thai worker. Quickly, we became acquainted with one another and\
  \ before long our chauffeur arrived and we were jumping into an unstable tuk-tuk,\
  \ already crammed with tipsy partygoers, bracing ourselves for one of the most unforgettable\
  \ nights of all\u2026"
