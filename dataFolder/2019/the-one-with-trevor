Text: "Denpasar Airport. All passengers were trying to fill up forms or wandering\
  \ around to find their respective queues for immigration. It was 1 in the morning,\
  \ and everyone's tired from the flight from Singapore that was delayed by 6 hours.\
  \ \n\nI had organised a SCUBA diving safari with three other friends. We were supposed\
  \ to drive 3 hours up north to Tulamben from arriving at the airport to begin our\
  \ adventure that would bring us through the dive sites along the east coast of Bali\
  \ in our 5-night trip. I was told our dive guide, Amin, will be waiting for us at\
  \ the airport holding up a sign with my name on it. \"He's the smiley one\", the\
  \ dive tour organiser told me. My bags were first to arrive, so I left to check\
  \ on Amin as my friends waited to gather theirs. There it was, the sign with my\
  \ name on it being held out by this smiling guy who was obviously tired from the\
  \ long wait, resting his head on his arm as he leaned on the railings at the arrivals\
  \ hall. I came to greet him and introduce myself, and his face immediately lit up\
  \ knowing that it was finally time to leave. \n\n\"Yeeeeeess, my name is Amin. This,\
  \ Trevor.\" He points to the guy beside him. I shook both their hands wondering\
  \ what a posh western name \"Trevor\" was given the Indonesians would typically\
  \ have phonetic names sounding like \"Ketut\" or \"Suharto\". My friends have arrived\
  \ with their bags, so I introduce everyone - \"This is our guide, Amin, and this\
  \ is Trevor.\" After a quick exchange of pleasantries, a toilet break, and a stop\
  \ at McDonald's (back then, this was the only food option open at 130am in the Denpasar\
  \ airport), we were off to our first stop. \n\nThere was nothing like checking into\
  \ a beautiful room after countless hours of travel, but waking up to the rest of\
  \ the resort the morning after was an even bigger treat. There was a sprawling garden\
  \ right outside the rooms, and the path leading towards the dining hall took you\
  \ right by the infinity pool that faced the sea we were going to explore in the\
  \ next few days. I took a seat right by the corner where I could bask in the sun's\
  \ rays and enjoy the ocean breeze on my skin while waiting for my breakfast. This\
  \ was how mornings were going to be for a full week. I was stoked. \n\nThe first\
  \ couple of days had gone with Amin showing us all the underwater and \"topside\"\
  \ (how divers would call \"land-based\" things) wonders of Bali, always telling\
  \ us to \"yeeeees, jas relaaaaak, you're on vacation!\" with his charming accent\
  \ as Trevor drove us from one place to the next. Trevor was more the quiet type,\
  \ though, just helping us with our dive gear before and after the dives and then\
  \ hanging out the with the other locals during our stops. \n\nOn our third day,\
  \ Amin came to pick us up from the hotel lobby and started leading us to the van.\
  \ Once we were all settled in and the van started rolling out, Amin told us with\
  \ his usual smiley face and stretched vowels, \"yeeeees, okaaaaaay. Todaaay, old\
  \ Trevor sick. This new Trevor, Ketut.\" He patted the shoulder of the van's driver\
  \ as he introduced him to the us. We all had a silent moment trying to digest what\
  \ he just said, but my eyes were already widening and I had started sweating in\
  \ disbelief and embarrassment as I realised the other guy wasn't \"Trevor\" after\
  \ all - he was, actually, the \"driver\". We had been calling him \"driver\" the\
  \ entire time because of me! I immediately asked Amin to apologise to \"Trevor\"\
  \ in our behalf because, as it turns out, we were totally being rude to him the\
  \ entire time calling him by his job instead of his name. While I was sincerely\
  \ apologetic about what happened, I couldn't help but let out a very nervous laugh\
  \ while the girls kept hitting me, also from disbelief. Naturally, though, Amin\
  \ just smiled back at me and said, \"yeeees... jas relaaaaaak!\""
