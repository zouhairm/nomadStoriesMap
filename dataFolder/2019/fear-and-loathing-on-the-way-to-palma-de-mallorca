Text: "I decided to unload from work for several days, having been on a short journey.\
  \ However, I did not have a clear travel plan, I only had a dream - to visit the\
  \ island of Mallorca. That was my leap into the unknown.\nIn this story there will\
  \ be two main characters: I, who lives in real life, - person who rationally thinks\
  \ over what to tell aloud, we will call him by my real name - Aleksandr, and I,\
  \ who can say everything whispering, and in general everything not speaking out\
  \ loud, in other words the person called \u201Can inner voice\u201D. We will conditionally\
  \ call him The Magnificent Zeus, and yes, he asked to call him such way. \nBoth\
  \ of us (me and my alter ego) received the \u201Cexplosive\u201D news from my wife.\
  \ Aleksandr rationally wrote in WhatsApp, that if the news is \u201Cexplosive\u201D\
  , then it is not the best idea to discuss it before the airplane flight. As a result,\
  \ after checking in for the flight, both of us were already on the bus to plane,\
  \ when the weird man in uniform entered the bus and asked if Aleksandr was there?\
  \ Zeus argued that there are no such people here, but Aleksandr interrupted him.\
  \ He asked for my international passport, and began to take photos of all the pages.\
  \ Zeus began to wonder: \u201CYo, ma man, what do ya need in my passport\u201D.\
  \ Yes, my alter ego a little bit from Dominican Republic. Aleksandr was waiting\
  \ for his passport.\nBus driver started screaming: \u201CUh, I can not wait for\
  \ so long, get off my bus. \u201CLovely Russia and its tolerance towards everyone\u201D\
  , - said Zeus. We went to the ladder.\nAfter a few hours of flight, I landed in\
  \ Germany.\nIn Cologne, I settled the hostel (4 beds in one room). Since I was very\
  \ tired, and it was already around 7 PM, I went to bed immediately, not for a long\
  \ time. As soon as I tried to fall asleep, madness began to occur on the streets.\
  \ The Germans outside shouted in German: \"We are against fascism.\" First, I thought\
  \ it was performance for me as for Russian, but at the same time, I didn\u2019t\
  \ even clap and didn\u2019t buy tickets. At about 2 o'clock some neighbors burst\
  \ into my room, turned on the lights, they saw that I was sleeping or at least tried\
  \ to pretend to sleep. They said: \u201COh, we are so sorry\u201D ... And left the\
  \ light on, they get outside the room. \nFew time later they returned, they saw\
  \ that I was sleeping, said: \u201Csorry\u201D, like if \u201Csorry\u201D was universal\
  \ word that forgives you all sins. After getting blessed from someone but not from\
  \ me, they began to talk loudly. At some point, I thought that the idea of performance\
  \ about fascism began to take an individual character in my room. One bed was still\
  \ free at this time. But it was not long in coming. One man entered the room, most\
  \ likely he was fat, I did not open my eyes. He also asked blessing by \u201Csorry\u201D\
  \ word, and began to walk around and breathe heavily into the lighted room, despite\
  \ the fact, that his bed did not occupy the entire perimeter of the room. His actions\
  \ were periodic: he walked around his bed and breathed loudly. I thought what is\
  \ going on, did the last act of Mussolini capitulation begin in staging of scene\
  \ about fascism? Nevertheless, I fell asleep again, I woke up at 3 AM. All three\
  \ of my new neighbors were sleeping. Oh, how sweet is revenge. \u201CSorry\u201D\
  , - I said and turned the light on. \nThen I boarded the plane and he safely transferred\
  \ me across the Alps to the island.\nWhat can you feel when you put your hopes on\
  \ the place where you fly to and it exceeds all your expectations? Happiness. Delight.\
  \ The only thing that both of us (me and my Alter ego) will agree on is that any\
  \ journey any journey changes you as a person. You gain experience and you will\
  \ not be the same. You are getting better.\nFriends, be better! And travel! It's\
  \ worth it!"
