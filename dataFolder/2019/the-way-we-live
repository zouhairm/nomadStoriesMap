Text: "Every story has  its own abstruse ending same goes with me , my trip start\
  \ starts with nill km and ends up with 2400 km and that was a road trip and the\
  \ best part of road trip is that we not only enjoy the beauty of that place but\
  \ comes to know some unknown facts about that place , because a real Traveller love\
  \ to go by a road trip , as our trip starts from Delhi capital (India) to Jaisalmer#sam\
  \ sand dunes #longewala  , our first day rest point was  udaipur which takes around\
  \ 10 hours to reach over there with around 7 pit stops  that was a truly tired traveling\
  \ but when we are traveling with our friends it doesn't matter how harsh the condition\
  \ was it's all ends with a smiley \U0001F60A\nTheir we stay on a hotel good in class\
  \ and next morning we take a  survey over udaipur city , and the places were really\
  \ iconic and well maintained , palaces nd fort \nThen at evening around 5pm we depart\
  \ for Jaisalmer and it takes around 11 hours to reach Jaisalmer Sam sand dunes as\
  \ the NH were too fine all credits goes to BRO. Border road organization , thier\
