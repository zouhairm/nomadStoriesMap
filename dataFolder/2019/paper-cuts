Text: "Every morning the bem-te-vis cawed relentlessly. Their English name, the Great\
  \ kiskadee, is similarly onomatopoeic. Kis-ka-dee, bem-te-vi, kis-ka-dee, bem-te-vi.\
  \ More effective than any alarm clock, the birds roused us from our bunkbeds. It\
  \ was time to get to work.\n \nThere were seven of us at the hostel, each from a\
  \ different country, with little in common other than a lust for travel and a tight\
  \ budget. Through a work-exchange program, we found ourselves constructing a mosaic\
  \ for a hostel in Rio de Janeiro.\n \nOn good days, the work of repeatedly smashing\
  \ tiles, cementing them to a smooth surface, and praying that they make a recognizable\
  \ pattern was meditative. On the worst days, we sipped cold beer and distracted\
  \ ourselves by watching the city below. From the favela, everything looked small.\
  \ Even the Sugarloaf Mountain was reduced to the size of a cruise ship, floating\
  \ steadily on Guanabara bay.  \n\nWe always worked diligently, taking off protective\
  \ rubber gloves in favor of the precision that our naked fingers afforded. I struggled\
  \ to hold the broken tiles in a way that didn\u2019t deal paper cut-like damage.\
  \ \u201CMerda!\u201D I\u2019d curse, while fishing ceramic shards from my skin.\
  \ \n \nGradually, shattered tiles became waterfalls, heliconia flowers, the Christ\
  \ statue, and our beloved bem-te-vis. They also became a small, cartoonish depiction\
  \ of the BOPE.\n \n\u201CBefore the BOPE, young women like you couldn\u2019t come\
  \ here.\u201D Bob, the hostel owner, explained at lunch. He was indulging my curiosity\
  \ about our neighbors. As Bob talked me through the history, I eyed the grey-faced\
  \ fortress. \n\nFour guards patrolled the building from its rooftop terrace. They\
  \ were just far enough away that I couldn\u2019t distinguish any facial features.\
  \ What I could see were rifles and bullet proof vests. When they caught me staring,\
  \ I waved to them. They didn\u2019t wave back. \n \nThe BOPE, or Special Police\
  \ Operations Battalion, is better known to the English-speaking world as the \u201C\
  Elite Squad.\u201D They fly what could easily be mistaken for a pirate flag\u2014\
  a skull stabbed with a knife, superimposed on crossed rifles. Their presence is\
  \ ubiquitous in Rio\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, called favelas.\n \nRio\u2019\
  s favelas originated in the late 1800s, when displaced soldiers and ex-slaves used\
  \ the unclaimed hillsides to build makeshift houses. These shantytowns continued\
  \ to grow later on, when rural Brazilians immigrated to the city to seek work. The\
  \ disparities between those living on the hills and those at sea level were, and\
  \ still are, staggering, and favelas quickly became hubs for illegal drugs, illicit\
  \ firearms and gangs.\n \nEnter the BOPE. The Elite Squad invades favelas by force.\
  \ They are sniper-armed combatants, specially trained to kill drug traffickers on\
  \ sight. Their presence leads to shoot-outs and rogue bullets. Already this year,\
  \ photos have emerged online, detailing the bloodshed in not-yet pacified slums.\n\
  \ \nOn Sundays, the scent of their barbecue wafted across the whole neighborhood\
  \ and we could hear them laughing at their posts. \u201CAre you scared of them?\u201D\
  \ I asked a waiter. He looked up at the headquarters and then away. \u201CThey don\u2019\
  t come down here anymore.\u201D\n \nThere is no longer a reason for the BOPE to\
  \ come down. Any drug lords or lackeys that once resided in this particular favela\
  \ are now ghosts. So too, are the residents that got caught in the crossfire. If\
  \ the ends justify the means, then this slum speaks to the success of the Elite\
  \ Squad. No drugs means more tourism, which in turn means more legal businesses\
  \ and jobs in the community. \n\nBusinesses like hostels. \n\nOn my last day working\
  \ on the mosaic, I hurried to finish my section before embarking on my next adventure.\
  \ I wondered whether my ceramic kiskadee would still be here the next time I visited--if\
  \ the paper cuts would ultimately be worth it. After I placed the last triangular\
  \ piece on the wall, it struck me that no matter how deep the shards cut, I never\
  \ actually bled."
