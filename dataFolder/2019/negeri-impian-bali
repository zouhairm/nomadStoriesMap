Text: "Making the decision to travel to a culture so vastly different than our own\
  \ is scary, and exciting. But what makes it even more scary and exciting is the\
  \ chance to travel alone. I went to Bali for 3 days, staying in an airbnb, not knowing\
  \ what to expect at all. Previously, I had been to every continent with my family\
  \ except one, Asia, and this was the place I was exploring without my safety net\
  \ of family and friends. But I don't regret a single moment of it. \n\nThe aim of\
  \ my solo travels was to make a leap into the unknown, before I started uni. You\
  \ know, one of those cliched phrases \"to try and find myself\". So I thought the\
  \ best way to find myself would be to immerse myself in activities I had never experienced,\
  \ My first day, I tried a sport I had never done before: surfing. This was extremely\
  \ exhilarating as I gradually learnt to be able to stand up on my board, cruising\
  \ along the waves at Kuta beach. That afternoon, I wandered the art markets where\
  \ I stumbled upon a batik class. Batik, which I was completely unaware of before,\
  \ is an ancient Indonesian practice of waxing and dying. I really enjoyed working\
  \ with a local artist on producing a one of a kind piece, which I will treasure\
  \ for life. \n\nThe next day, I decided I would take a trek , approximately 4 hours\
  \ walk along the coastline from where I was staying. The sunsets along the Bali\
  \ coastline were rumoured to be unmissable, and they certainly didn't disappoint.\
  \ Trekking along a coastal road that I had never explored before, with limited internet,\
  \ just time for myself to take in the beautiful surroundings, not knowing where\
  \ I would end up was extremely exciting. Finally, I stumbled upon the Tanah Lot\
  \ temple, where at low tide you can walk over and be blessed, at high tide it is\
  \ cut off and isolated on its own little island. I was certainly expecting to find\
  \ temples in Bali, which has an overwhelming Hindu population, but I was certainly\
  \ not expecting the magic of this temple. \n\nMy last day in Bali was spent in what\
  \ many call the spiritual and cultural centre of the island, Ubud. Here, I explored\
  \ rice fields, jungles, temples and even a monkey sanctuary! This little town in\
  \ the middle of the Balinese rainforest was so different to the sprawling and overpopulated\
  \ party coastline of Kuta and Seminyak, it was a refreshing change which I was extremely\
  \ grateful to have experienced. Bali is such a tiny but varied island, full of the\
  \ unexpected and unknown, which I wholly recommend everyone should visit, to change\
  \ their perspective on the world and their place within it."
