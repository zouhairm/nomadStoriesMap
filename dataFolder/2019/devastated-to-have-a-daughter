Text: "\u201CI was devastated when I had my daughter.\u201D\n\nI fumbled the bowl\
  \ I was holding when I heard my colleague, Susana, say this. We were washing dishes\
  \ under the hot Guatemalan sun, using a Guatemalan pila - a concrete sink used for\
  \ many purposes. This one was painted bright yellow. \n\nSusana\u2019s bubbly 4\
  \ year old daughter was chattering away to herself while playing nearby. Had I misunderstood\
  \ due to my poor Spanish? Seeing my surprise, Susana clarified, \u201Coh, not because\
  \ I didn\u2019t love her, I do very much; but I was devastated because I knew how\
  \ hard her life would be as a girl.\u201D  \n\nSusana went on to recount story after\
  \ story of harassment, abuse and discrimination that she had personally suffered.\
  \ \u201CI just wanted to have sons because life is so much easier for them!\u201D\
  \ \n\nThe conversation was cut short as the 12 homeless girls we cared for arrived\
  \ back from their morning at school, filling the house and yard with loud chatter\
  \ and bickering and laughter. \n\nI was only 21, and incredibly na\xEFve. I had\
  \ left behind some family drama and a chronically ill mother in Australia. I had\
  \ not been given a high school education as my family held some very conservative\
  \ views about the role of women (\u2018what use is a university degree if you\u2019\
  re just going to get married and have children!\u2019 I was told numerous times).\
  \ I carried a fair amount of self-pity for my situation, and I dreaded the thought\
  \ of finding myself in a mediocre marriage with no career, stuck in the same suburb\
  \ for my whole life. \n\nFeeling depressed and stuck, I had fled to Guatemala in\
  \ an effort to find some sense of purpose, direction and adventure in life. I wanted\
  \ to learn about the world, and try and give back if I could. \n\nAnd I found more\
  \ than I ever could have bargained for. I found adventures and community. I floated\
  \ down crystal blue rivers under a tropical canopy of trees with newly-made friends\
  \ from around the world, flew around mountain corners as though on a roller coaster,\
  \ gripping tightly to the each of a crowded seat in a chicken bus, and melted my\
  \ shoes on lava as we looked down from an active volcano over a spectacular valley\
  \ filled with coffee farms. I encountered a hospitality like no other; I suddenly\
  \ felt as though I had ten families and the loneliness and insecurities that had\
  \ gripped me at home were suddenly gone. I finally felt alive.\n\nBut there was\
  \ more to learn. Guatemala also taught me the brutal realities of this life, and\
  \ booted me out of my self-pity.  As the girls filed back into the home that day,\
  \ I reflected on my conversation with Susana, and I thought about each of the trials\
  \ those young girls had encountered. One had been sold at only 12 years old and\
  \ held captive (and abused) for two weeks. All of the others had also been subjected\
  \ to abuse. All just because they were girls, and had lost the \u2018lottery of\
  \ latitude\u2019, born into poverty. My heart broke.\n\nMaybe my well-intentioned\
  \ family weren\u2019t so bad, I thought. Perhaps I didn\u2019t need to dwell in\
  \ so much self pity. And perhaps, even without my high school diploma, there were\
  \ opportunities available to me in Australia that I must not take for granted, that\
  \ I could then use to help others.\n\nBefore returning home to Australia, I nervously\
  \ drafted an application to university, and was accepted as a mature aged student.\
  \ I came home and threw myself into my studies, beyond thrilled to be in a classroom.\
  \ My beautiful Guatemalan families were never far from my mind. After graduating\
  \ with several awards under my belt, I walked into my new job. The first thing I\
  \ placed on my desk was a photo of those beautiful Guatemalan girls, the ones who\
  \ helped me to appreciate how much I did have in life and to seize those opportunities\
  \ to move forward.\n\nI\u2019ve been back to Guatemala twice since, always learning\
  \ more about the best and worst aspects of life, and looking for ways to give a\
  \ girl a boost in life, just as Guatemala gave me."
