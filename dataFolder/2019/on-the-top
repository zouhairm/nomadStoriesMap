Text: "Best fish soup ever. All 4 of us agree on it.\nWe get out of the old Estonian\
  \ restaurant and the Brazilian girl says she really wants to buy some souvenirs.\
  \ And maybe some food as well, because the food on the cruise ship is expensive\
  \ or shitty - and because we are students, we can afford only the second category.\n\
  3 magnets for me- I believe it brings luck, 4 postcards for the Brazilian -she has\
  \ nephews to write to, and something spicy to eat for the funny Indian guys. \n\"\
  Ok, let's see what time it is and where the cruise ship is located.\"\n\"Oh, we\
  \ still have 1 hour and 15 minutes\".\n\"You're sure, right? Don't forget about\
  \ the hour change - lucky to have that! Haha\"\n\"Sh*t. Ok. We have 15 minutes left.\
  \ F*ck. See that small dot over there? Yeah, according to the map, that's our ship.\"\
  \nWe run like crazy towards that colorful dot, hoping we're gonna make it. The girls\
  \ believe in one god, the boys in more goddesses, but everyone was silently praying\
  \ for a miracle while running. It's getting darker and the cold streets are getting\
  \ emptier. We manage to find someone while running and ask him \"Sorry, sir *gasp*\
  \ Where's the harbour? *cough & heavy breathing*\" \n\"Park. Whoop!\"*hands showing\
  \ to cross over* \n\"Ok *gasp* thank you!\"\nRUN, FORREST, RUN!\nRun like nobody's\
  \ watching. Go back to praying.\nWe arrive on the top of the park and see that there's\
  \ no way out of it because of a huge grey wall. We are on the highest point of the\
  \ city, we can see the colorful dot which should be our ship. 10 minutes left. There's\
  \ no way we can do it. NO WAY. I achieved the top of the park AND the top of my\
  \ limits and feelings. NO WAY!\n--\nOk, let's see. I am with 3 people that I've\
  \ just met in this trip, all of us with nothing on us because our luggage is on\
  \ the ship. We just have the passports, the phones full of pictures but with no\
  \ battery, 3 magnets, 4 postcards and some shitty snack that I can't even smell\
  \ because they are spicy. Oh, yeah, and it's freaking cold, the coldest and grayest\
  \ day of November I've ever had.\nWe are screwed.\n--\nOk, we gotta focus. C'mon,\
  \ you've been through worse, you have to find a solution. Ok, if I find a charger,\
  \ I have Airbnb, Booking.com and Couchsurfing on the phone so we can ---\n\"GUYS.\
  \ RUN. WE CAN DO THIS!!!\" screams the curly skinny Indian. \nRun like never before.\
  \ Remember that action movies? Remember Captain Marvel after she embraced her feelings?\
  \ FLY LIKE HER. Just run. Imagine you have some red Nikes on your feet. What would\
  \ be written on the shoe box? JUST DO IT.\nI am telling all of this to myself while\
  \ running like never before. I hate running. I don't run for fun, but the adrenaline\
  \ takes some laughs out of this run from me. I laugh like crazy, hysterical, while\
  \ running, and everyone does the same. \nWe keep the rythm, that's good. \nI can\
  \ hear my heart. Is it normal? OMG, I can feel my heart in my head pumping like\
  \ crazy. I think I'm gonna pass out.\n\"YOU CAN DO IT, GUYS, I TRUST YOU. LET'S\
  \ DO THIS!\"\nThis funky Indian saw me today for the first time in his life, and\
  \ he trusts me. Well, I don't, but I don't want to disappoint him AND I don't have\
  \ any money left for extra expenses like an extra overnight in Estonia. And I can\
  \ see the ship!!!\nStill running & getting closer. At least I can talk to myself\
  \ while running like maniac, although it's getting noisier in my head because of\
  \ the pumping.\nPlease don't pass out, you'll reach your destination in 3....2...1....\n\
  PASS OUT ON THE SHIP. The Brazilian is handing my passport to the authorities for\
  \ onboarding and the guys are dragging me inside.\n------------\nA few hours later,\
  \ I was dancing like crazy on one of the ship's clubs with my new best friends shouting\
  \ WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE! Thanks to my three magnets, I guess?"
