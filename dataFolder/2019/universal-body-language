Text: "Making out, snogging, pashing...tonsil hockey, frenching, smooching... There\
  \ are many different terms to describe the pastime that takes place in every society\
  \ in one form or another.  The Russian verb is \"\u0446\u0435\u043B\u043E\u0432\u0430\
  \u0442\u044C\", but I don't find that the proper verb \"to kiss\" is appropriate\
  \ for (i.e. it doesn't even BEGIN to describe) what Russian youth love to do in\
  \ public areas. It is very bizarre to be in a country where it borders on rude to\
  \ smile at someone in the street, and yet publicly sucking face is so acceptable.\n\
  \nEverywhere you go in St Petersburg there are hormonal Russian youth in heat, jaws\
  \ locked so tight it's as though they're auditioning for the role of a Death Eater\
  \ in the Harry Potter franchise.  Normally, public displays of affection don't bother\
  \ me -I think PDA is cute.  But in Russia some of the public makeout seshs have\
  \ really -to be honest -grossed me out.   Perhaps I'm turning into a disapproving\
  \ babushka prematurely, but the way some of the youth here carry on (\"rutting\"\
  \ is the term that most quickly comes to mind) is at serious odds with the much\
  \ less passionate surroundings.  Metro, sidewalk, escalator, elevator -all are potential\
  \ makeout spots in America/Australia too! But not usually when you're ass-to elbow\
  \ with a crowd of people so tight you can't move. Most elevators in Russia are small\
  \ - but an elevator built for 4 that has 7 people in it already is no deterrent\
  \ for the youth of Russia when they want to get their game on.\n\nI was sitting\
  \ on the metro, and one such young couple was standing right in front of me.  It\
  \ was like watching a car wreck -violent, incredibly disturbing, and at the same\
  \ time impossible to look away.  Usually I can ignore people kissing in public -I\
  \ avert my eyes for the sake of privacy- but this was impossible.  At one point\
  \ my mouth actually dropped open into a little \"o\" of disbelief.   I would expect\
  \ this kind of thing on an escalated Saturday Night Live sketch starring Kate McKinnon,\
  \ I've never witnessed such a show in public.  The term \"maccing out\" came to\
  \ mind.  It was as though they each had macaroni and cheese smeared all over their\
  \ faces and crammed into every crevice (and I mean EVERY crevice), and were trying\
  \ to clean it off each other with their tongues and gums.  \n\nWhat amazed me most\
  \ was my reaction to it.  I could practically feel myself pulling my scarf up over\
  \ my head Nonna style, my lips and shoulders tightening up in disapproval.  As I\
  \ got a grip, reminding myself that I shouldn't be tutting at teenagers just yet,\
  \ it struck me that noone else had so much as blinked.  Even the old ladies on the\
  \ train weren't paying any attention -and little old ladies in Russia are militant.\
  \ They will yell at strangers on the street for something as simple as not wearing\
  \ a warm hat.\n\nAs I reflected on the extremity of the public cavity searches,\
  \ it occurred to me that there was probably a good chance that these kids (oh god,\
  \ am I really already calling them \"kids\"?) both live in small apartments, and\
  \ share a very thin walls with a grandmother or some other member of the family.\n\
  \nIn such a seemingly passion-less society (that's a sweeping overstatement, not\
  \ to be taken too seriously -but Russians are not renowned for being the most cheerful/colorful\
  \ population in the world, or for their raw passion and sexuality) in a society\
  \ like this it's seems out of place to see these hormonally vibrant displays on\
  \ the street.  But keeping in mind that in many living situations in Russia privacy\
  \ doesn't really exist, it kind of makes sense.  On the street -where people avoid\
  \ even eye contact- is almost as private as you can get.  It makes sense that all\
  \ the available passion is channelled to these areas, where people are busy with\
  \ their own agendas and don't care.  You're hiding in plain sight.\n\nStill, it\
  \ may take me awhile to get used to this particular cultural anomaly.  What is the\
  \ Russian equivalent for \"get a room\"?"
