Text: "When your friend hits a break up and want to relive his stress, the only help\
  \ I could offer was a trip. With total of 5000 INR we decided to board a train which\
  \ is ready take off at the time we reach the railway station. I thought we could\
  \ go to some place in South unfortunately the train which was ready to start within\
  \ 15 mins was Kerala express ( Trivandrum to New Delhi). He did not have a second\
  \ thought and was ready to board the train, I had second thoughts more than 10 times\
  \ but his wish made me get in the train. Two boys without any tickets entering General\
  \ category compartment by which we get first come first serve kind of seats, fortunately,\
  \ we decided to take the luggage stand as our birth in opposite sides. We did not\
  \ have any proper food, all we had was drinking water and snacks served in running\
  \ train. But these small hardships never affected us, our energy was fully charged\
  \ as we had the destination in our mind which is New Delhi. After the trip I realised\
  \ that if we have a destination/target in our mind we can reach it without feeling\
  \ the bitterness faced on the way. Once we were halfway through the train was entering\
  \ The state of Andhra Pradesh where one have to face these tough transgenders on\
  \ the train. The ones in the General compartment faces toughest of them, we need\
  \ to pay them to get their blessings, if we deny the payment they will start cursing\
  \ and start touching your private parts, this will continue till you give them the\
  \ money. One thing about them is they will not deal with girls and women, they have\
  \ decided their prey to be boys and Men. So, yes we paid them and safe guarded ourselves.\
  \ Also, you need to remember that we cannot complain these transgenders to any railway\
  \ security or police as they don\u2019t know how to deal with them, these guys really\
  \ have a peculiar way of life. The next stage was entering the North Indian railway\
  \ stations, and we were so thirsty. We bought drinking water from someone who was\
  \ selling them on platforms, once the train moved I saw him filling the empty plastic\
  \ bottles by water coming through normal pipe, only then we realised there was no\
  \ seal for the bottle that we bought. Finally, we reached Nizamuddin railway station\
  \ in the evening which has 16 platforms till then I haven\u2019t seen such big railway\
  \ station in my life.  The funniest part is we can live in that railway station\
  \ if we are ready to sleep on the floor, they have comfortable rest rooms as well.\
  \ So, as we don\u2019t have any money for accommodation we decided to make this\
  \ railway station our stay. We decided to have some food, as our budget is so weak\
  \ we entered the smallest restaurant and disappointed ourselves with the worst food\
  \ I have ever had in my life. Our fully charged mind just got weaker and weaker\
  \ every hour. So, we went back to railway station and decided to have a good sleep.\
  \ Woke up in the morning had a tea, walked to the metro and decided to have a small\
  \ ride in the metro, we chose some destination and while we were travelling we saw\
  \ the list and noticed there is a stop which is near Qutab Minar. Even though our\
  \ tickets were two stops before this Qutab minar stop, we decided to get down at\
  \ Qutab minar stop and when we were crossing the exit the metro staffs stopped us\
  \ as our tickets were expired before two stops and we had to pay the fine to leave\
  \ the metro station. We needed to cross two roads to enter Qutab minar and in the\
  \ first road cars were flying like anything and my friend who is very bad in crossing\
  \ roads as he has high level of fear made a delay of almost 30 minutes to get a\
  \ safe time frame to cross the road. Whatever, we arrived a Qutab minar, it was\
  \ like cool ambiance, stuff we saw was real antique piece..."
