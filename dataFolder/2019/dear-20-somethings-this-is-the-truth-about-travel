Text: "Stepping off the plane, there should have been a warning sign that reads, \u2018\
  Caution! You might temporarily forget the person that you are by trying to fulfil\
  \ the expectations of what you see on social media.\u2019\n\nI wish I had known\
  \ this as I lugged my suitcase along the maze of the London Underground \u2013 as\
  \ I tried to understand the map of colour-coded railways that made me feel lost\
  \ through sight alone.\n\nYou cannot see it in photographs but the tube is a tin\
  \ can of marmalade: a mixed-fruit melody of people jammed into a tight space. The\
  \ conservative Catholic woman finds herself pushed up against a Muslim man making\
  \ his way to the Mosque. \n\nThe first and only picture that I posted in London\
  \ was a selfie taken in a nearby bar. I guzzled the contents of a cocktail, ordered\
  \ another, thought to myself, \u201CThis is what 20-something-year-olds are meant\
  \ to do when they travel: drink, rave and brag about it online,\u201D but what no\
  \ one saw were the repercussions.\n\nThat night, as I stumbled onto the train headed\
  \ in the direction of my accommodation. I placed my bag upon an empty seat. When\
  \ I got up to leave, I forgot to take it with me. It wasn\u2019t just a bag; it\
  \ was a sentimental item given to me by my mentor who recently passed away from\
  \ cancer. It wasn\u2019t just a bag; it held my cash passport, which contained all\
  \ my money, as well as the access card to my room. \n\nTo make matters worse, a\
  \ homeless lady, perhaps sensing my disorientation, began spewing insults at me\
  \ as I staggered along Three Colts Lane. With a wild lash, she reached out, striking\
  \ me on the head. I run towards my apartment. In tears, I begged the superintendent\
  \ to let me into my room. He agreed reluctantly, reminding me that the cost of a\
  \ lost access card was \xA320 \u2013 a hefty price to pay for a drunken selfie posted\
  \ with the caption \u201CWhen in London, do as the Londoners do.\u201D\n\nAfter\
  \ that, I stopped worrying about social media content. Instead, I called the bank.\
  \ They block my card and agree to wire the remaining money to the nearest Western\
  \ Union. Next, I contacted the train station to report my missing bag. Then, I set\
  \ off on the city once again, no photo opportunities, just me. \n\nI found myself\
  \ at the V&A Museum of Childhood where toys from throughout history were put on\
  \ display. No photograph could capture the nostalgia of pick up sticks and Lego\
  \ blocks: things that preoccupied numerous hours of my time as a child. \n\nNo image\
  \ could compare to the feeling of absolute alignment as I sat in the Ideas Store,\
  \ a public library, sifting through \u201CA Memoir of (My) Body\u201D by Roxane\
  \ Gay, as the page cried out to me \u201Cresist surrendering to what is expected\
  \ of [you].\u201D\n\nNo video could capture the gratitude in the Bangladeshi salesman\u2019\
  s gaze as he uttered \u201CThank you, my sister,\u201D after I decided to buy fresh\
  \ produce from Whitechapel Road Market instead of an overpriced corporation.\n\n\
  From Monday to Saturday, St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral is a tourist attraction. After\
  \ waiting in line, people can pay \xA317 for a photograph of the extraordinary architecture.\
  \ On Sunday, however, the church restores itself as a place of worship. Anyone can\
  \ sit through the service on one condition: no pictures. I have no photographic\
  \ evidence of how the light trickled in through the stained glass windows, dancing\
  \ to the hummed hymns of the choir. That is the closest I have come to becoming\
  \ a believer. \n\nThere are several things that I recall from the experience without\
  \ having to rely on external imagery: the sticky sweetness of freshly fried plantain,\
  \ the lather of laundry detergent upon my bare hands as I washed dirty clothes in\
  \ the sink of my apartment at 2am, how, when I finally remembered who I was in a\
  \ foreign place, I received an email reporting my missing bag found. \n\nNo picture\
  \ on social media could capture the experience of losing myself and finding myself\
  \ a more fulfilled and present person upon the streets of London."
