Text: "Last year I went to Mexico for a four months journey. I'm a 30 years old Literature\
  \ teacher and a selftought photographer, and I was feeling a little bit tired of\
  \ my daily routine. So the main idea of the whole trip was getting out of my comfort\
  \ zone, putting myself into new and unknown situations, taking pictures, meeting\
  \ new people and writing chronicles about the trip.\nI started my journey at Riviera's\
  \ Maya and then going up north. I I've spent a couple of weeks in San Cristobal\
  \ de las Casas, wich is a beautiful village in Chiapas State. \nDuring my staying\
  \ I heard about a little communitty called \"San Juan Chamula\". Other travellers\
  \ told me about their syncretic rituals, their particular traditions and they also\
  \ warned me about them being quite rude to foreign. Local citizens told me how to\
  \ get there and gave me little tips for not disturbing  the indigenas community,\
  \ so I went with a swiss guy that I met at the hostel. Both of us were really excited\
  \ and chilled at the same time.\nWe arrived at San Juan Chamula at midday, without\
  \ having any kind o spectations more than knowing the syncretic church and the cemetery.\
  \  But as soon as we entered into te church we found an indescribable scene: thousands\
  \ of coloured candles, copal fog, incense smell and a bunch o families praying on\
  \ their knees, speaking tzotzil to catholic saints. Most of the families had some\
  \ chickens ready for being sacrified and they used soda drinks like Coca Cola for\
  \ their ritual.\nI was completely out of my mind. Everything was absolutely amazing\
  \ and powerfull, I would say, mesmerizing. I was fully tempted to get my camera\
  \ out from my bag, but I also had a deep sense of respect going inside me, so I\
  \ decided to leave it there. Suddenly, a large procession got into the church and\
  \ they started playing really simple and sad music with some old guitars and an\
  \ accordion. The leader of the procession had a huge bowl with copal and incense\
  \ burning in. The church became a surreal film. My swiss friend and I were amazed\
  \ and speechless. That same day, we went back to San Cristobal village without saying\
  \ any word.\nThe story could end here. But the universe works in mysterius ways,\
  \ and four days later, I went back to San Juan Chamula again. I was not fully conscious\
  \ of why I was getting back there, but I had a hunch and I listened to it. This\
  \ time I went with other three backpackers. We got inside the church and nothing\
  \ different was going on. Except this time, after being on my knees for a long time\
  \ watching a family doing a ritual, the family Guy smiled at me and invited me some\
  \ Pox, a traditional alcoholic beverage from Chiapas. We made eye contact and he\
  \ started talking very softly and gently to me. He invited me and my friends to\
  \ their house. As I was the only spanish speaker in the group, I had to translate\
  \ his words. We were so happy and anxious about knowing them better that we said\
  \ \"of course\" immediately. \nA couple of minutes later we were on a rusty and\
  \ old wagon, with the entire family chatting and smiling to us. The air was hitting\
  \ my face. I was on extasy being aware that that was an inflection point in my life.\
  \ Getting to know a deep mexican farm family, their food, their clothes, their rituals\
  \ and their stories was something I've been looking for my entire life.\nFrom that\
  \ moment on, I decided to travel and write chronicles about the people and the places\
  \ I go to. Somehow I think I rediscovered my purpose in life."
