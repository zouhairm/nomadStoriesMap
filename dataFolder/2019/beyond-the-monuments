Text: "A guest house staff looked at me with a raised eyebrow and a frivolous smirk.\
  \ He then playfully ran a quick gaze from top to bottom and rhetorically asked \u201C\
  You?\u201D, this was when he found out I planned to go boulder climbing later that\
  \ day. I laughed over his judgment of my climbing capabilities and Oh! how right\
  \ was he!\n\n After lazing around and settling in, my friend and I made our way\
  \ out the guest house to find a climbing shop called \u2018Tom and Jerry\u2019.\
  \  If one had to locate us, we were walking along the Tungabhadra River, a place\
  \ infamously called Hippie Island.  It is here where I felt like a foreigner in\
  \ my own country, few Indians were seen. We strolled along the shady and mucky roads\
  \ passing by bountiful fields which came to life with the mild breeze and plenty\
  \ of makeshift stores. At one such temporary shop, sat a young man probably in his\
  \ early twenties, a local who spoke English with an accent that made mine feel inferior.\n\
  \nThis was Sunny, our climbing instructor for the day. He learned his trade from\
  \ the people who graced his land from his childhood; this explains his unique accent\
  \ and ability to converse in several languages.  With him, we made way to the top\
  \ of a rocky hill which carried several magnificent boulders, and in whose backdrop\
  \ the smell of an illegal herb lingered in the air probably a strain from Mysore.\
  \ As we prepared for our climb, Sunny showed at a distance, an incongruous and lone\
  \ white wall amidst the paddy fields. It had a painting of a rock climber spray\
  \ painted over it, a gift from visiting artist I learned later. This was where his\
  \ old shop stood; the land was seized and the building bulldozed by the government\
  \ in the name of protecting the old heritage monuments within the expanse. Now,\
  \ only this distinctive wall remained.  This was the norm and plenty was the woes\
  \ of the people who lost their livelihoods and were forcefully displaced from homes.\
  \ One cannot envisage the burden a World Heritage title bestows.\n\nAfter the grueling\
  \ climb, we sat on an enormous boulder along with several other locals and foreigners.\
  \ They organically and in sync crafted music with locally made djembes and ukuleles.\
  \ As I watched the sunset, a little monkey made its spot next to me. It chewed on\
  \ my jacket\u2019s aglet with no guilt while we waited for the sun to sleep. As\
  \ the sun sunk slowly, the boulders, temples and monuments graced the horizon asserting\
  \ their supremacy over the lands. I could see the greatness of the land I was in,\
  \ a World Heritage Site, a land of monuments, Hampi. \n\nAmidst them all, the remnants\
  \ of the old Tom and Jerry shop stood tall with the art gleaming proudly, sharing\
  \ a unique story and a past. This to me was Sunny\u2019s heritage, for who are we\
  \ to put boundaries on what needs to be protected and what is Heritage."
