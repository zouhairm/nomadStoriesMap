Text: "It\xB4s a happy chaos. People rush to find a seat in bars that smell of ground\
  \ coffee and crepes du chocolat. They sit facing the street beneath burgundy tapestries\
  \ and golden, vintage letters. Silky lines of cigarette smoke float through the\
  \ air and laughter bursts over the hum of voices. Waiters fly past the crowd with\
  \ trays beneath their arms and sweat on their brows. More chairs are thrown on the\
  \ sidewalk and I feel my knees tremble with excitement. \n\nThe center of the square\
  \ explodes with color where canvases fight for attention; shades of red, blue and\
  \ yellow made bright by the sun. The Pont Neuf under a rainy day is portrayed with\
  \ thick strokes of paint; the curves of naked women are delicately traced with Chinese\
  \ ink and the streets of Belle Epoque Paris twinkle, immortal. Fingers darkened\
  \ by charcoal offer to sketch my face. \nTrees, stripped naked by winter, line the\
  \ square and project their silhouettes onto the buildings above the bistrots. Later,\
  \ when twilight comes, they\xB4ll stretch and dance across the walls, bringing new\
  \ shapes and colors. Music travels with the wind into the sea of people; a cello,\
  \ a trumpet, and a single drum fill the air with tunes of jazz and swing. The playful\
  \ sound makes the blue sky and many hearts smile. \n\nReality seems so distant in\
  \ Place du Tertre. You feel as if you were inside one of the paintings for sale.\
  \ It\xB4s a place that exhales life from every corner; a gift for all the senses.\
  \ Time regresses, and you sink deeper and deeper into the past. Details take you\
  \ to a time when bistrots were open until sunrise and absinth poured endlessly.\
  \ A time when spirits roamed free and drunken bodies danced the can-can. A time\
  \ when people lived for pleasure; for art; for freedom. \n\nErnest Hemingway once\
  \ frequented these bars to give himself over to his vice, with Scott Fitzgerald\
  \ by his side. Dal\xED and Picasso perfected their style. I see Le Consulat where\
  \ Toulouse \u2013 Lautrec, Van Gogh and Degas would often dine. Nameless bohemians\
  \ and dreamers. They populated this neighborhood to drown themselves in art, music\
  \ and sinful pleasure; living in bliss while marginalized from society. But vices\
  \ and sexuality were not to be hidden in this underground culture, rather accepted.\
  \ Beauty lied in the corrupt and poor. Misunderstood geniuses, living together and\
  \ thriving on their own madness, portrayed an unknown world that was free in body\
  \ and mind.\n\nToday is special. Today I, a foreigner, become part of the painting;\
  \ part of the city\xB4s history. My mind travels to centuries past as I walk by\
  \ the Sacre Coeur and relish a world that\xB4s as surreal as it is enticing. Here\
  \ lived and learned the greatest minds in history. Masterpieces we admire today\
  \ were born here, in the surroundings of Place du Tertre. Here in Montmartre. \n\
  \nThe bohemian spirit is still present everywhere you turn, and it\xB4s admirable\
  \ the way Parisians honor it\u2013 how they keep it alive. People in the subway\
  \ hold books on their laps instead of phones. Vintage shops decorate the streets,\
  \ selling vinyl records and books so old that their pages have turned yellow and\
  \ stiff. Local artists, literates, and musicians are widely recognized and celebrated.\
  \ And it\xB4s so special to see the effects of this dynamism. A city that is vibrant\
  \ and young, but also classic and timeless. I reflect upon the treasures that Paris\
  \ has given the world as the streets of Montmartre unravel before me. \n\nI\xB4\
  ve been walking downhill for some time and notice the intensity of neon lights from\
  \ nightclubs and sex shops. The Moulin Rouge must be somewhere close. As I leave\
  \ behind this world of wonder and return to modern-day reality, I feel light at\
  \ heart. It was completely unexpected to feel so at ease and welcome; to feel as\
  \ if this small universe had been waiting for me with arms wide open. There are\
  \ places in the world that connect you with the essence of life; Time. Hardship.\
  \ Beauty. Montmartre is one of these places. A refuge for old souls. A place of\
  \ raw emotions and stories that resonate for eternity. For this, I\xB4m grateful."
