Text: "To the rational it would look like a simple crack. To the believers it is a\
  \ punishment. There are many stories in the world which we still cannot fathom.\
  \ This 450 years old, Kanak Durga temple of Jhargram in Bengal is one of those.\
  \ \n\nA paved way through the woods takes you to a freshly painted, simple and small\
  \ temple. The deity in it is goddess Durga in a different form. Here she rides a\
  \ horse and not a lion. The locals believe this is one of the most enchanted temples\
  \ known. The mark of their beliefs is a tree with many threads tied to it. Each\
  \ of which represents a wish. But what will lure your gaze away is this original\
  \ temple, adjacent to the new temple and the tree. With twigs crawling up and moss\
  \ wrapping it up. It is almost that the temple is shying away from something. A\
  \ heavy lock has kept it closed for centuries after an incidence. \n\nThree among\
  \ four of its walls have cracked. And quite astonishingly, they have cracked right\
  \ in the middle. The cracks on the front and the hind walls run almost parallel\
  \ to each other. They can be seen through each other even from a distance. A flight\
  \ of stairs adjacent to the temple takes you to the local Doolung river running\
  \ by. The stairs too have cracked up in the middle. \n\nThe locals say, it is the\
  \ wrath of the goddess. A priest had violated a woman in the temple. That night\
  \ a thunder struck and split the temple into halves. Ever since, no one has dared\
  \ to step inside. The Samanta Raja (king) of Chilkigarh built a new temple beside\
  \ this, where people come to pray today.\n\nThe locals also say that when the tides\
  \ are high in Doolung during full moon, they find a floating rock on the river.\
  \ It listens to the sorrows of the people and resolves it. \n\nNow, we might choose\
  \ to ignore the legends and tales. Look at these as superstitions. Or we might question,\
  \ why do people still believe? Is there a wisdom in local cultures? Is truth only\
  \ what we perceive by our senses, find reasons for or are things that are empirical?\
  \ Or do we need to look beyond what we see? Have we reasoned enough?\n\nThis spot\
  \ is certainly one of those few places, which will make you question. But it will\
  \ not leave you at that. It will make you find answers within yourself."
