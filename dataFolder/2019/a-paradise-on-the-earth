Text: "Hi,\nThis is David Johnson, well this story is all about a place named as Pondicherry.\
  \ As this is one of the most popular places in India. This is one of the union territory\
  \ of our country India. Which has been the most exciting and also interesting place\
  \ in my life. The people and places are both peaceful here. The city is not so large\
  \ but it would not be compared less than a \"heaven\" it also has a beach named\
  \ as 'paradise beach' where you can chillout and enjoy your quality time. This city\
  \ pondicherry, has most popular places such as French colony, Rock beach, serenity\
  \ beach, Auroville, the museum, paradise beach. Etc.. Talking about the temperature\
  \ in the city would be a high in day times, and very cold in the nights.\n     \
  \  The place Auroville is most popular and unique place to the people for  meditation.\
  \ This is a little longer longer from the city to travel, but it is one of the most\
  \ peaceful places ever experienced. The sun rays, which falls on the disc's will\
  \ be experienced directly by the person who will be meditating in the auroville.\
  \ A place to make yourself calm. Then next coming to the serenity beach,  is as\
  \ much busy as a popular beaches would be. The people there around the world to\
  \ practice the surfing and to learn surfing with their professional guides come\
  \ here. Evenings would be a great time to spend here. The crabs start coming up\
  \ when the sunset starts. And the waves starts increasing their speed that looks\
  \ very beautiful. To feel the cool breeze in the darkness ahead that's just feels\
  \ awesome! It just feels like heaven came down!!! \n        French colony is one\
  \ of the area in pondicherry next to rock beach, this area Is just like experimental\
  \ stuff like about house and house paintings just like in France. The independent\
  \ houses with the swimming pools inside which gives the best look the mansions.\
  \ And the hotels there are just fabulous, with the best taste of seafoods. The restaurants\
  \ are quite a high in price but tastes great! We can rent bikes to use it in and\
  \ around the city, which helps a lot to travelers to roam around the city on our\
  \ own in a very less price. The rock beach is next to the French colony, where you\
  \ can hangout for a peaceful quality time. \n   This city has travel connectivity\
  \ such as Railways, Buses and Airways and Seaways, to connect across the world to\
  \ the major cities. The people here are so good to the tourists they really treat\
  \ well and help in guidance over the city. Coming to staying here for rooms there\
  \ are some homestays, as well as hotels and lodges which are available in all the\
  \ prices ranges. I would just say this place is a so good place to chillout with\
  \ friends. Actually worth it in a best budget. \n     The most exciting thing in\
  \ pondicherry is the beachside, which gives a complete satisfaction for enjoyment,\
  \ and the seafood which is been sold on the beachside is the tastiest and spicy.\
  \ The fish roasted and prawns fried are just so delicious and tasty the best place\
  \ for foodies. \n    I could say this was one of the best places in my life which\
  \ I had ever traveled which gave me feeling especially those beaches!!! I simply\
  \ loved it. The people from other foreign countries come here to visit the 'Auroville'\
  \ which is known as one of the most popular places for meditation, this city covered\
  \ with beaches and places like this with the best OK class tastes of food and varieties\
  \ of the seafood. I would prefer to travel the city on bike rather than car to cover\
  \ all of the places to travel and a hassle free trip. To travel around the city\
  \ with your loved ones and enjoy all the beautiful places. \n    This city is I\
  \ would refer it to as a symbol of peace and the way people live here is so good\
  \ and well-being of the tourists they really treat well. Apart from the temperatures\
  \ in the afternoon the climate is so good to enjoy the places. The tax rates are\
  \ also very less compared to the other cities in India this also makes a unique\
  \ about this city \"pondicherry\". Rather would like to call it 'HEAVEN' the best\
  \ place called as Pondicherry!"
