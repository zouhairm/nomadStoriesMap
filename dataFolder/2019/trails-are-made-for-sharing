Text: "It was 4am. Dark. I was still wiping the sleep from my eyes as I trudged up\
  \ the steep path, and I could hear Jonathan yawning behind me. Every once in a while,\
  \ the electronic whine of a tui bird burst out from the quiet morning. The sun was\
  \ just beginning to rise as we reached bushline, glowing apricot on the horizon.\n\
  \nWe were seven thousand miles from home. For the past two months, Jonathan and\
  \ I had been living in our tent, hiking Te Araroa, an 1800-mile trail across New\
  \ Zealand. We'd hitchhiked four hours west to climb Mount Taranaki, an iconic volcano\
  \ rising straight from the ocean in total isolation. It's absurd, I suppose, hitching\
  \ 100 miles to scramble six thousand feet up a scree pile, but I doubt anyone with\
  \ a taste for adventure could look at Taranaki without being moved to explore it.\
  \  \n\nWe reached the snow-filled crater as the sunshine began to warm its icy surface,\
  \ and we carefully kicked steps up to the summit. The near-perfect circle of Egmont\
  \ National Park fanned out below us. We had the peak to ourselves.\n\nSlipping and\
  \ skiing our way back down the scree fields, we jogged past a train of hikers now\
  \ marching slowly upward. We still had a long day ahead. By the time we climbed\
  \ to the famous viewpoint at Pouakai Tarns, it was late afternoon. The summit was\
  \ cloaked in thick white mist, so we hiked on to our hut for the night. I put water\
  \ on to boil while other hikers bustled around me. \n\nThe pungent scent of Indian\
  \ curry wafted over from a neighbor's meal. \"That smells amazing,\" I sighed, looking\
  \ over wistfully from my instant ramen. The man leaned over his pot, brows slightly\
  \ furrowed. \"Chili-lemongrass tofu korma with coconut rice,\" he said, glancing\
  \ up. He was tall and thin, wearing running shorts and a GPS watch. His partner,\
  \ sitting across from Jonathan at the shared table, had sporty glasses and chin-length\
  \ hair. They seemed at home in the simple hut. \n\nOver dinner, we learned that\
  \ Brett and Michelle were from Wellington, out for a five day trek circumnvigating\
  \ Taranaki. Michelle had just come back from a month of bikepacking across Japan,\
  \ and Brett regaled us with tales from a four month cycling tour through South America.\
  \ \n\nJonathan and I described our epic journey and the massive day we'd just completed.\
  \ Their eyes gleamed with excitement. Often, when discussing our adventures with\
  \ others, the responses range from \"Why would you ever do that?\" to \"It basically\
  \ sounds like torture.\" To those who don't feel driven to test their endurance,\
  \ it's nearly impossible to explain the addictive joy of it. Immediately, however,\
  \ these two understood. \n\nThe four of us ventured back to the tarns as the sun\
  \ began to set for one last chance to glimpse Taranaki reflecting in the clear pools.\
  \ We talked and laughed; they geeked out over our ultralight gear, and we quizzed\
  \ them about the best local rock climbing. Slowly, the peak emerged above the valley\
  \ mist, the first tinges of pink framing its snow-capped summit.\n\nJonathan and\
  \ I headed back to Te Araroa the next day, continuing south through the Tararuas\
  \ toward Wellington. Three weeks later, we were walking through the city itself,\
  \ feeling overwhelmed by the noise and hubbub after months in the wilderness. I\
  \ shot off a quick text. \n\nThe reply came almost immediately: \"Come for dinner!\"\
  \ Somehow, walking into Brett and Michelle's apartment felt like a long-planned\
  \ reunion. We sampled Brett's homebrew and together prepared a veritable feast:\
  \ Malaysian peanut-kumara soup, followed by baked eggplant stuffed with spicy curried\
  \ lentils, and for dessert, a mouth-watering rhubarb crisp with ultra-creamy homemade\
  \ coconut yogurt. We ate picnic-style, sitting barefoot in the backyard grass. \n\
  \nIt is rare to meet people who you connect with so openly and immediately. It is\
  \ rare, but when I find myself getting travel-weary, these  encounters replenish\
  \ the sense of wonder that makes traveling worthwhile. Leaving Wellington on the\
  \ ferry, I smiled to no one in particular, dreaming of the adventures we'd share\
  \ with these new friends in years to come."
