Text: "In the end of January 2018, had a first international trip that is also a solo\
  \ trip to Bali,Indonesia. Bali is an amazing place we all know that and it is a\
  \ famous for honeymoon destination but I was traveling for a very different purpose.\
  \ I didn't visit those very famous tourist places but I visited some awesome unexplored\
  \ places. Actually I planned this trip very quick so it's difficult to get last\
  \ moment flight tickets in budget but I was lucky enough that I got cheapest tickits\
  \ of primeum economy class in rate of economy class. Ya\xA1 sometimes it's good\
  \ to book tickits on last minute! So had a good flight time, I booked one taxi for\
  \ my pickup nd daily travel ; he was amazing guy. It's a 6 day trip and 3 days for\
  \ explore Bali and other 3 days I booked for green village bamboo construction workshop.\
  \ So first three days were my travel and explore time. Starting with kuta, I explore\
  \ kuta by walk. Walked in the streets to the beach, shopping streets, spa areas\
  \ and lot many places. There I meet a lady who is selling a beach dresses and living\
  \ in the temple complex in front beach. 2-3 ladies came to me for selling their\
  \ products I bought some jewelry from them cause I am found of it but I didn't but\
  \ any beachwear, then also that lady started talking with me and explaining about\
  \ temple complex, beach stories, God stories and a lot. I clicked a picture with\
  \ her and at the time of leaving she told me to \"come to meet me again. \" as rain\
  \ started I walked back to my hostel. Hostel was amazing. Bought one beer and seat\
  \ on the terrace and talking with my self that how amazing time I spent on that\
  \ day and that lady was amazing. In few minutes two guys came and start playing\
  \ zinga next to me. I was looking at there and conversations began. They are from\
  \ Spain and there for vacation. Had a good chat and spend a good time. Day off.\
  \ Next day early morning left for Ubud,historic city. My plan was not to explore\
  \ tourist space so I choosed to go from different streets and explore architecture.\
  \ Though I visited goa gajah and all but most of my time I spent in streets and\
  \ meet local people. Then I visited nusa dua. Its an gallery of all types of Indonesian\
  \ houses and culture. A very huge property but pretty. If you want to visit Indonesia\
  \ in one afternoon, perfect place it is. In the evening went to a small Cafe in\
  \ ubud and had nachos in overhang balcony. At the time of return to house its a\
  \ dark night and literally I was scared to walk but reach safely. Last day as tourist\
  \ started with good breakfast and nice talk with house owner, I went off to luwak\
  \ coffee garden, see the whole process of making luwak coffee tasted it and even\
  \ shop it for my family I reached to my destination, green school. And from here\
  \ my role of tourist convert into student. Nice campus, nice hostel and very nice\
  \ food too. Green village/school/hostel all are awesome. At the workshop time I\
  \ met 7 different people from different countries and we had a very good and learning\
  \ time together. We share our experiences and knowledge with each other and we became\
  \ good friends in those three days. Had a party on last day of workshop and than\
  \ separated. Nxt day I had a flight back to home and I feel very nervous cause I\
  \ didn't want to leave. 6 wonderful days of my life. I met many different people,\
  \ visited many different places and made many different bonds. Amazing trip to BALI!\n\
  \nI didn't know about Bali or I didn't know any one in Bali but after 6 days I knew\
  \ lots of about Bali and know many different people of Bali and from other countries\
  \ too. First solo international trip was amazing and looking forward for more trips\
  \ like it.\n\nLike to explore unknown world!"
