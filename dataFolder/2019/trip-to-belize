Text: "In May of 2018 I finally got the chance to leave the country. I went on a mission\
  \ trip when I was Christian at the time. I secretly went for a chance to visit another\
  \ country. It was strange just how real the place felt. I was on a different part\
  \ of the planet and it wasnt all on a tv screen. The giant furns and jungle life\
  \ seemed like alien life forms. \n\nIt was fascinating to get a different feal from\
  \ the culture and environment. I was so used to the american atmosphere. I loved\
  \ how laid back everything seemed. I felt like I was closer to the world around\
  \ me. I loved how there was actually color on the buildings.\n\nUnfortunately, my\
  \ biology would often make it difficult to go out for long periods of time. I am\
  \ a very pale and i have blonde hair and blue eyes. I would have to put on sunscreen\
  \ before I went out. I would drink 7 glasses of water and still be thirsty. It didnt\
  \ make me too uncomfortable, but I am unsure if it would be the healthiest choice\
  \ for me to stay there long term. In an optimal situation I would go teach english\
  \ there. I was love to explore central America and understand another culture."
