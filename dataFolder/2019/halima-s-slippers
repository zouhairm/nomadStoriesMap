Text: "On the way to a caf\xE9 one morning during my five weeks in Marrakech, I found\
  \ myself walking in gratitude for the little path in the middle of the street, the\
  \ expanse of boulevard on the way to the Medina, the whispering trees above, and\
  \ the kind, hard-working people who care for the many beautiful outdoor spaces in\
  \ the city.\n\nA couple of weeks in, two ladies came to our door to clean our apartment\
  \ in Marrakech: Halima and Nora. Halima and I made my bed together, \u201CComme\
  \ \xE7a,\u201D she showed me. Like this. Then, pointing at my bare feet standing\
  \ on the ancient marble floor, she said, \u201CTes pieds sont froid au matin,\u201D\
  \ and then pointed at her own, pink-slippered ones, promising \"Demain...demain\
  \ je t'apporterai des pantoufles. Tes pieds doivent \xEAtre si froids!\" Tomorrow\
  \ I will bring you some slippers...your feet must be so cold!\n\nScatter joy, my\
  \ best high school friend always says; spread love where you can. It is contagious.\
  \ Some in our travel group feel challenged by living in Morocco, by their perceived\
  \ need to defend, to walk quickly away. Just wait a minute, I say to them; wait\
  \ until eye contact lands and locks, and it\u2019s safe, and they see, and you see,\
  \ and you smile together. In Moroccan culture, I believe friendship can be instant,\
  \ perhaps divinely inspired, and life-long, if you just allow it. All that is needed\
  \ is the decision to receive and enter a new, shared space of community. To pause\
  \ for that science-fiction klink! to register internally, as when something is plugged\
  \ into a West World character\u2019s robot brain and it reboots: just stay until\
  \ that click happens in your center.\n\nOne of the precepts of Islam is to perform\
  \ acts of charity and kindness. The simplest and easiest of these acts can land\
  \ so well on other humans. Kindness translates in every culture, transcends any\
  \ religion, and flies on the wings of universal love in every atom around the world:\
  \ the jasmine of Thailand; in the mint tea leaves of Morocco; the eyes of a cleric;\
  \ the tip of a kitten\u2019s nose. The Beatitudes in Christianity; the kindness\
  \ of the Dalai Lama; your neighbor as yourself in Leviticus; the respect of Native\
  \ Americans for plants, minerals and animals.\n\nI hadn\u2019t noticed Halima\u2019\
  s slippers said LOVE on them at first. LO- on the left; -VE on the right.\n\nThen,\
  \ on the way further to the cafe, I came upon two giggling school girls on their\
  \ break, walking closely together as any giggling school girl in the world might,\
  \ maybe talking about what the teacher said, or that Hicham smiled at Touria during\
  \ Algebra. One of them peeped around the other when I passed, and so I smiled. And\
  \ waited a beat, then two, and there it was: klink! the sunshine rays of smile I\u2019\
  ve come to appreciate, bathe in, practice here in Morocco. I am now their Instagram\
  \ friend and English tutor: \u201CHi. I am a girl found in front of the high school.\
  \ You can help with my essay? Happy day.\u201D\n\nWhen I came home after work one\
  \ evening, two weeks after my cold feet conversation with Halima, I hung my jacket\
  \ in the closet as usual. Something caught my eye. On the floor were pink slippers,\
  \ LO on the left, VE on the right. A note written carefully on a stained piece of\
  \ graph paper with Arabic on the back sat on top of them, contained Halima's address\
  \ and phone number; her sister Amina's phone number; and an invitation: \"Welcame\
  \ \xE0 ma housse.\" I slipped them on immediately, comfortable and warm.\n\nWe\u2019\
  ve moved on now, to the next country, with its own new and surprising gifts. Halima\
  \ called me out of the blue the other day, on her son\u2019s phone, just to tell\
  \ me that when she goes to E-19, our old apartment, she smiles and thinks of me."
