Text: "When the teenagers of Stepanakert want to slip away from the prying eyes of\
  \ their elders, they sneak a little way from the city centre. They walk under the\
  \ rows of drying washing, to the grand, yet abandoned, Soviet-era theatre. Young\
  \ couples, or perhaps soldiers looking for a moment of peace, wander here. Since\
  \ the last performance took place here in 2012, this building, nicknamed the Beauty\
  \ of Stepanakert, has watched over them all.\n\nThe theatre, which first opened\
  \ in 1932 before being rebuilt in 1952, is one of the walking wounded of an ongoing\
  \ conflict. It lies in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh \u2013 or the\
  \ Republic of Artsakh \u2013 a mountainous land of beauty which is the cause of\
  \ bitter contention between Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nWhen both former Soviet States\
  \ broke away from the USSR in the late 1980s, they rejoiced in independence \u2013\
  \ and then began to fight for control of this region. Until 1994 there was open\
  \ warfare, causing thousands of deaths, with a devastating siege and bombardment\
  \ of Stepanakert. A fragile ceasefire remains and war still lingers in the air.\
  \ Artsakh is now a de facto independent state with an Armenian border.\n\nThe theatre\u2019\
  s courtyard remains intact, along with a statue of its eponymous father, the Soviet-era\
  \ actor Vahram Papazyan. His furrowed brow stares out, away from the theatre, to\
  \ the streets, welcoming visitors. High above the double hand-carved wooden doors\
  \ a faded Soviet star remains.\n\nOnce through the doors you find yourself in a\
  \ lobby, where spectacular buffets were once laid out on opening nights. The whole\
  \ city would be alive in anticipation, recalls Karine Alaverdyan, whose father served\
  \ as the theatre\u2019s literary and art director for 50 years. Those lucky enough\
  \ to have tickets would dress in their best. A live orchestra would greet them.\
  \ There\u2019d be drinks, a dance. \n\nA doorway leading to the balcony seats reveals\
  \ itself and passageways into the main auditorium. Here, the scene grows more tragic.\
  \ The 360 red velvet seats, many damaged, slope towards the wide stage - which has\
  \ been ripped apart to renovate other theatres. A 20-bulb chandelier dangles from\
  \ the ceiling, surrounded by islands of chipped pastel-green paint and peeling wallpaper.\n\
  \nBroken floorboards, cracked stairs with scratched bannisters, makeup areas, and\
  \ even a bomb shelter unfold inside the labyrinth behind, below and above the stage.\
  \ The shelter was a common hide-out during the war.\n\nPerformances continued here\
  \ during the conflict - comedies mostly, to maintain morale. But six years ago the\
  \ local theatre troupe was moved out, to make way for renovation work that never\
  \ arrived. A string of broken promises by culture ministers. \n\nBut things are\
  \ changing. The Yerevan-based Institute of Contemporary Arts is reviving the theatre\u2019\
  s fortunes for Stepanakert\u2019s first ever contemporary arts festival.\n\nProductions\
  \ used to include regional epics, as well as Shakespeare and Dickens. And, while\
  \ the majority of plays were performed in Armenian, at least once a year they would\
  \ perform in Azeri. The international feel is back for the festival as artists from\
  \ New York, Switzerland, Israel and Jordan descend on Stepanakert. And they\u2019\
  re all using the building\u2019s history as inspiration.\n\nOne installation mines\
  \ the archives of the costume department. Several outfits hang from a temporary\
  \ scaffold, surrounded by posters, pamphlets and props from old productions.\n\n\
  The festival serves as a deconstructed journey through the theatre\u2019s past.\
  \ A mock grandfather clock in one room, a hoe, helmets, dozens of spears in another.\
  \ A silent audience of single light bulbs, one placed above each seat, face the\
  \ stage.\n\nBut this is not just about romantically preserving a derelict theatre.\
  \ Funding can only pay for some of the repairs needed, though many visitors hope\
  \ it could ignite further efforts.\n\nThe conflict and uncertainty continue with\
  \ regular violations of the ceasefire. Festival curator, Anna Kamay, says the theatre\u2019\
  s neighbours often ask her whether there are plans to rebuild the bomb shelter.\
  \ Fragile Armenian-Azerbaijani relations still haunt this community as she tries\
  \ to restore its cultural hub.\n\nYet, for one weekend, again they came. From the\
  \ villages, the city, Armenia and beyond. To see this jewel partly revived. \u201C\
  It\u2019s a stepping stone\u201D, one resident says. \u201CThe building is happy\
  \ today. There is life here.\u201D"
