Text: "Everyone knows the phrase: \u201CStranger danger.\u201D The media often sensationalizes\
  \ the horror associated with interaction with strangers, to dispatch a message:\
  \ mind your own business. That\u2019s what Canada, where I\u2019ve lived most of\
  \ my life, has taught me. But my motherland Nepal\u2014a distant stranger\u2014\
  had other plans for me.\n\nI never thought that travelling to Nepal would change\
  \ my life: what memories I had of it were fleeting, ephemeral. Canada was my new\
  \ home. However, I had always felt this strange connection to visit my homeland.\
  \ My first adventure took place hundreds of meters above the ground, in the winding\
  \ roads surrounding the valleys. I felt as if I was soaring across the luscious\
  \ green valleys to take a sip from the shimmering waterfalls, so different from\
  \ those in Canada. Suddenly, our jeep came to a stop, one hundred meters below one\
  \ of the most famous historical heritages of Nepal: \u201CSwargadari,\u201D the\
  \ land of the Gods. Wearing my gigantic trekking boots, I started to climb my way\
  \ up the untamed mountain to reach a powerful monument of Lord Shiva. His hands\
  \ held a mighty trident, with his eyes fixated on me. Clasping my hands together,\
  \ I closed my eyes and embraced the serenity of the winds whistling age-old melodies.\
  \ I felt a tear flow slowly down my face. To this day, I do not know if I had been\
  \ crying, or if it had been one of the many small rain droplets falling to the ground.\
  \ \n\nI felt a tap on my shoulder: our tour guide was prompting us to return to\
  \ the jeep. Drenched with rainwater, we were on our way back to Kathmandu, only\
  \ for the jeep to come to a sudden halt. The mud had engulfed our tires. There was\
  \ nothing separating the jeep from the edge of the cliff. There were no hotels or\
  \ residents nearby\u2014it was the middle of the night and we were completely isolated.\
  \ \n\nDespite the feeling of futility, everyone on the jeep looked at each other\
  \ and held each other\u2019s hand and smiled. The craziest thing about us, humans,\
  \ is that we never lose hope, no matter the potency of the outcome. \n\nBy coincidence\
  \ or a spiritual communication, our desperate prayers called a few villagers towards\
  \ us. Our tour guide, being the most fluent in the native language, Nepali, expressed\
  \ our condition. The oldest villager whispered a few words to the others, and they\
  \ all left. They are strangers to us, and we to them. The world is a stranger.\n\
  \nAnd yet, in an hour I saw a crowd of villagers return. They would let us stay\
  \ in their village overnight. Internally, gratefulness warred with confusion: why\
  \ would they help a stranger? In the midst of this, I felt the gaze of the eldest\
  \ villager, who beckoned us to follow him with a smile.\n\nNavigating in the dark\
  \ with only candlelight to guide us, we saw a modest hut made of stony bricks intricately\
  \ weaved with straw. The hut was only the size of my living room back home, but\
  \ my heart felt lighter, comforted. \n\nWhen the early morning light illuminated\
  \ the heaven-like hut, I was informed that a large tractor had pulled our ditch\
  \ out of the jeep; we would finally return home. However, I already felt at home,\
  \ with a country I once called a stranger. Feeling thankful, I pulled out some Canadian\
  \ dollars and offered them to \u201CBaje,\u201D the eldest villager, who immediately\
  \ pulled me in for a warm hug. Instead of accepting the money, he placed two cookies\
  \ in my hand. This time, I felt tears flowing down my face. Why had I distanced\
  \ myself from my own homeland and the opportunity to embrace new people? \n\nIt\
  \ is ironic that a prosperous country like Canada preaches isolation, whereas the\
  \ Nepalese villagers, despite lacking wealth, had more kindness to give. This connection\
  \ to my motherland always brings a smile on my face, guiding me to be generous to\
  \ all. I went to Nepal thinking of adventure but came back with renewed faith in\
  \ the goodness of humanity, of people I will never see again."
