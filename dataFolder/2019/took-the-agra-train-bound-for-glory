Text: "I\u2019ve heard all the stories about deadly derailments in India. Every time\
  \ I tell anyone I\u2019m taking the train to Agra, I hear another tale of deaths\
  \ and dismemberments.\n\nYet here I am  in a hygienically questionable and unquestionably\
  \ crammed third-class carriage on the way from Delhi to Agra, trying not to think\
  \ like a fussy western tourist. \n\nI have to get to Agra to see the Taj Mahal\u2014\
  I\u2019ve been dreaming of this place since childhood\u2014and on what\u2019s left\
  \ of my budget a third-class rail ticket is the only affordable option. \n\nMy first\
  \ mistake is asking the Uber to drop me at the train station without specifying\
  \ which one. There are two, New Delhi and Hazrat Nizamuddin, as I only learn later,\
  \ and my driver doesn\u2019t bother to ask. \n\nHe drops me at Nizamuddin, the further\
  \ of the two. A bigger fare for him, and the start of a nightmare for me.\n\nThe\
  \ station is swarming with travellers and well-wishers, and for every one of these\
  \ there seem to be two or three hawkers trying to sell every conceivable kind of\
  \ food and merchandise. None of them are shy about yelling in my ear or tugging\
  \ on my clothes to get my attention.\n\nI ask anyone who will pause for a moment\
  \ where I can get a ticket to Agra. To my na\xEFve surprise, most can\u2019t speak\
  \ English, or just don\u2019t want to, but finally someone understands and points\
  \ me towards the right counter\u2014another sea of jostling people away.\n\nMy South\
  \ African street smarts finally kick in. I pull up my hoodie, bring my backpack\
  \ in front, hold it against my chest, and ram forward through the throngs. \n\n\
  When I reach the counter, I scream \u201CAgra!\u201D as if this could be the name\
  \ of my lost child. The ticket man yells back, \u201C150 rupees!\u201D and we exchange\
  \ money and ticket across other people\u2019s shoulders while he smiles wanly at\
  \ this black man looking lost in what is possibly India\u2019s most crowded and\
  \ chaotic place. \n\nBut I feel like a veteran now and waste no time shoving myself\
  \ towards the platforms, By now the crazy stampede doesn\u2019t bother me at all.\
  \ I just keep yelling \u201CAgra!\u201D until someone shows me my train. \n\nIt\
  \ is more full of people than the station, if that is even possible, but has the\
  \ same pungent smell. No free seats of course, but I manage to find a space near\
  \ a window where I might be able to breathe.\n\nPassengers continue to push there\
  \ way in until the train starts moving, but things calm down after that. People\
  \ become chatty and nice in a genuinely friendly way. A woman sings traditional\
  \ songs. Children play hand games, lost in their own world. Old people doze off,\
  \ and I gaze out my window at the ageless beauty of the Indian countryside. \n\n\
  I feel like I am finally experiencing the \u201Ctrue\u201D India, and even the hassle\
  \ at the station fades into a sense of \u201Cauthentic\u201D travel!  \n\nA lady\
  \ standing next to me asks me something I can\u2019t hear. I pull down my hoodie,\
  \ and her face lights up with excitement. I hear \u201CNEGRO!!\u201D from a teenage\
  \ boy further down the carriage. He points in my direction with a huge smile on\
  \ his face. \n\nMy first reaction is anger, but the boy looks friendly and pleased\
  \ (with maybe a touch of guilt or embarrassment) and I can\u2019t help smiling back.\
  \ He probably just doesn\u2019t know any better word to refer to a black person.\
  \ I nod to assure him I\u2019m not offended. \n\nNow other passengers are pushing\
  \ through the crowded carriage just to get a glimpse of this Negro. In halting English,\
  \ some ask me where I\u2019m from, and when I say South Africa (guessing Botswana\
  \ will leave them stumped), we start chatting as best we can. We talk throughout\
  \ the two-hour journey and when I say goodbye to them at Agra station, I feel like\
  \ I\u2019m parting from friends.\n\nWas this cheap, smelly, crowded train ride to\
  \ Agra better than my expensive guided private tour to Jaipur? You bet. The tour\u2019\
  s air-conditioned bus was a treat, but the experience felt impersonal and full of\
  \ artificial tourist interactions."
