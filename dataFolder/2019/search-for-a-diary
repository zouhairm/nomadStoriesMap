Text: "My search for a diary with pictures of local places of interest on its cover\
  \ was leading me nowhere \u2013 it was ten-shops-and-three-trips-down-the-winding-road-and-no-luck\
  \ o\u2019clock on my watch.  As the bus now moved along the lush green vineyards\
  \ and up the serpentine road that would take me back to the picturesque village\
  \ of Foglianise, I started to wonder where I could go next in search of a diary\
  \ to scribble down my enrapturing countryside travel experiences in Italy.  This\
  \ was to be my last ride up this mountain. I was to join the second host family\
  \ in another village the next day.  \n\nWith my forehead already pressed against\
  \ the window, I waited with bated breath to take in the magnificent sight of La\
  \ Dormiente del Sannio, or in our language, the Sleeping Woman of Sannio, for the\
  \ last time \u2013 the sight of three rocky peaks conflating to form the outline\
  \ of a sleeping woman. As I stared into the distance with my eyes as wide open as\
  \ a child\u2019s upon seeing a shooting star, little did I know that three weeks\
  \ after descending the same road tomorrow, I would end up with the following: an\
  \ original piano tune as a dedication; an oil painting reproduction of Caravaggio\u2019\
  s work as a gift; a handmade diary, the cover of which proudly flaunted the grandeur\
  \ of the quiet municipality of Benevento, as a token of gratitude; and most importantly,\
  \ another family I could call my own, and to whom the idea of having a young girl\
  \ in the house was as alien as I felt when I walked into that rowdy, all-boys class\
  \ of twenty fourteen-year-old students.\n\nIt was the first time that I, a twenty-one-year-old\
  \ Pakistani girl, had ventured out of my country.  Did I see you retrace your steps\
  \ a little at the name of Pakistan?  Oh well, the name of my country has the superpower\
  \ to make people retract.  However, this was not the reaction in class when I announced\
  \ that I was from Pakistan as a seven-week volunteer teacher for English. Hardly\
  \ anyone knew about my country in this quiet city of Benevento.  And an even more\
  \ laid back and serene place was my next destination \u2013 Monte Pino, a village\
  \ that hardly exists on Google.\n\nThe first time I saw my fourteen-year-old host\
  \ brother, Francesco, in class, he was shyly telling his friends that his family\
  \ will be hosting me for three weeks.  His home in Monte Pino was on the top of\
  \ a steep hill bedecked with olive trees.  As I dragged my bag up the precipitous\
  \ garage, he nervously paced in front of the main door.  Just when he was turning\
  \ the handle, the door opened itself and out ran an eight-year-old child straight\
  \ at me like a canon, but with open arms.\n\nWhiffs of freshly cooked pizza dough\
  \ wafted from the kitchen.  My host-mother was already scampering to get me a fresh\
  \ pizza straight from the oven, while my host-father tried to learn how to pronounce\
  \ my name.  This is when Francesco made magic on the piano for the first time, his\
  \ fingers traveling on the keys as smoothly as a fairy flying amongst the clouds.\
  \  \n\nIt then became a ritual \u2013 every day, Francesco would learn five new\
  \ words of English, and then I would listen to his mellifluous piano tunes, captivated\
  \ to the core, only to be even more mesmerised by his exceptional self-executed\
  \ paintings. Every time he saw my mouth go round in awe, he laughed a half-embarrassed\
  \ smile.  Despite his weak English and zero experience of having a sister, our bond\
  \ continued to grow till the day of departure arrived.\n\nI was almost done with\
  \ my packing, when the sound of a soft piano tune emanated from the lounge.  I walked\
  \ up to Franceso, and while enjoying the tune, my eyes caught sight of his notes\
  \ that said, \u201CDedicato a Izz Ansari\u201D.  He then pointed to a painting by\
  \ the piano that I had still not noticed \u2013 it had today\u2019s date on it.\
  \  And then I saw the handmade diary, no longer empty, but with indelible memories\
  \ already etched on it."
