Text: "\"I haven't lived the best life, but I also haven't lived the worst.\"\n\n\
  The truth of these words, spoken by a man who for anonymity's sake shall remain\
  \ unnamed, hit me almost as hard as the desert heat that sweltered around us. I\
  \ realized in that moment that we both were a long way from home.  \n\nI had come\
  \ to Mexico a student of human rights, and I was hoping to put into practice all\
  \ that I had learned over the course of my studies. Restless as only an adolescent\
  \ can be, I sought that which in my mind all young men must come to desire at some\
  \ point or another; adventure, camaraderie, and the sense that one's life is on\
  \ the cusp of amounting to something worthwhile. Having been bombarded with snippets\
  \ of wisdom gained from a world beyond the classroom, I was eager to make myself\
  \ a man of the world. Standing as though my shadow were casting me somewhere outside\
  \ the quiet Queretaro town of Tequisquiapan, I found in a stranger that which I\
  \ had been searching for; namely, myself. \n\nSituated in south-central Mexico,\
  \ Tequisquiapan is a sleepy resort town known for its cobblestone streets, and wine.\
  \ Outside of town, where the roads turn to gravel and the dusty Bajio hills roll\
  \ like waves, a rail line runs north to south. In fact, this juncture serves as\
  \ a choking point of sorts, where most all trains from Central and South America\
  \ pass through on their journey north. For migrants seeking a future in the developed\
  \ world, these trains constitute the quickest means of transit. At a deteriorating\
  \ switching station miles outside of town, I spoke candidly with a Honduran man\
  \ who had disembarked from one such train seeking the same thing as me; food, shade,\
  \ and someone to talk to. \n\nFlavored with hand gestures and as sincere a demeanor\
  \ as I could muster, I discussed life with a man who, save for a matter of circumstance,\
  \ was not so different from me. He spoke fondly of family back home, shared with\
  \ me poetry he had written on the road, and tempered my first-world naivete with\
  \ tales of what violence he had experienced on his journey north. Having been robbed\
  \ blind at the border in Chiapas, he found himself without the means to bribe the\
  \ armed guards that patrol the freight trains, and so was looking to find some form\
  \ of temporary work prior to resuming his journey. Had I anything but my ear to\
  \ offer, I might have, but he assured me that he wouldn't be lingering for long.\
  \   \n\n\"Do you know where you want to go?\" I asked him. \n\n\"Long Island,\"\
  \ he said. \"I have an uncle there who can help me.\"\n\n\"Have you ever met him?\"\
  \n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you know where Long Island is?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI pulled up a\
  \ map on my phone, squinting as the Mexican sun cut into my eyes, and pointed at\
  \ the northeastern United States. Had it been me, I might have given up upon learning\
  \ how far off my destination truly was. My friend, however, simply nodded to himself.\
  \ \n\n\"I have no place else to go,\" he said. \n\nAnd so hope, in spite of adversity,\
  \ would drive him forward. I thought about my own circumstance in that moment, and\
  \ reflected on the universality of that sentiment. We had both ended up strangers\
  \ in a foreign land in search of something bigger than ourselves - for my friend,\
  \ livelihood. And for me, the sense of being alive at all.\n\n\"Do you ever get\
  \ angry?\" I asked. \"About the unfairness of it all?\"  \n\n\"Yes, but those things\
  \ can't be helped. I haven't lived the best life, but I also haven't lived the worst.\"\
  \ \n\n\"It's reassuring to think so, isn't it?\" I said. \n\nAnd then we parted.\
  \ Him to find a means of attaining livelihood, and me to reflect on the one that\
  \ I owned. Life is sometimes unfair, I remember thinking. The conversations you\
  \ have with strangers in the most unexpected of places reflect this more than anything,\
  \ but there's something beautiful there. If two men from disparate walks of life\
  \ can connect, maybe anything is possible. \n\nIt's reassuring to think so, anyways."
