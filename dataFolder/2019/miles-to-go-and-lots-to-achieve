Text: "Dreams are not just to keep in mind,dreams are to be explored.Explore to the\
  \ unknown explore the adrenaline rush,always go ahead make ways where there's no\
  \ way.Try to lead a signature step of yours from which others could extract courage\
  \ and go onto make their own signature steps.\nI've always wanted to explore the\
  \ whole world,explore the unknown excitement,experiences,happiness the earth holds\
  \ out there for me.One day I'm gonna catch them all fly high will all dreams in\
  \ my tank to the fullest.And more specifically I live my life by a code and that's\
  \ \u2018REGRET NOTHING & LIVE EVERY MOMENT & ENJOY EVERY MOMENT\u2019.\nAnd that's\
  \ all I wanna do,I want to run into strangers ask them to indulge me into theirs\
  \ activities,laugh with strangers,knowing about their culture and list goes on,list\
  \ never stops.\nWe got one life to live so why not live it to fullest.\nWe all got\
  \ those hiccups or our problems I should say,but they teach us so those are also\
  \ important in our life for those life changing lessons.Because from there we're\
  \ onto becoming ourselves,finding ourselves,more precisely living our life to the\
  \ fullest.\nI've always wanted to be a photographer,because what a photographer\
  \ sees no one else could.\nThey got fantasies and that leads them to unknown clamness\
  \ of our beautiful earth which we ain't gonna find out in the cities.\nThe nature\
  \ has lots to offer,and once you got that thing,the peace will be yours."
