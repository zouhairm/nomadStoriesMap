Text: "As a second-generation immigrant, I struggle with feeling connected to my parents'\
  \ native country. This is particularly true whenever I\u2019m reminded, even by\
  \ strangers, how un-Arab I act, look, speak and even love. This always made my biennial\
  \ summer vacations in Tunisia a particular experience. I had the opportunity to\
  \ observe as an outsider, Tunisia evolving through its political changes in parallel\
  \ to my own growth, giving an entirely new understanding of my environment every\
  \ visit. \nLast summer, I visited every tourists\u2019 first stop in the capital\
  \ for the first time: the Bardo Museum. Recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO,\
  \ this museum built in an ancient palace contains the largest ancient mosaic ever\
  \ found, so big it had to be cut in three pieces. Guided by my mother\u2019s limited\
  \ knowledge, we wondered around, overwhelmed, pointing at golden merchandises and\
  \ handwritten manuscripts not unlike an ancient souk where history had long replaced\
  \ the spices and cacophony.  A guide finishing a tour caught our attention but as\
  \ things often happen in life, with a mixture of good timing, luck and maybe a sparkle\
  \ of magic, it just so happened that he was about to take his lunch and thus presented\
  \ us to his colleague, Azem. \n Azem started off by showing us his extensive knowledge\
  \ as he introduced us to the affluence of the Cartagena Empire and the tiny country\
  \ it would become, his voice, the thread we followed as he guided us through a maze\
  \ of Hellenistic sculptures, marbled staircases and unlit catacombs. My 9 years-old\
  \ sister\u2019s curiosity was piqued by the bullet holes on the walls and floor,\
  \ holes that I frankly hadn\u2019t even noticed. Azem asked us if we knew what had\
  \ happened. He tried to hide his disappointment as we looked at each other and shook\
  \ our heads. March 18, 2015 at 12:30, the Bardo museum fell victim to a violent\
  \ terrorist attack. 22 civilians died. Azem had breakfast in the morning, went to\
  \ work and started giving his tours, like usual. He would never be the same man\
  \ after that morning. At the time of the attack, he was accompanying a Spanish family\
  \ and a young German couple, the woman happened to be pregnant. As soon as they\
  \ heard the sound of the rifles, he looked through the windows to see two young\
  \ men shooting at a tourist bus. The passengers were screaming and evacuated inside\
  \ the museum as quickly as their legs could carry them. As they entered, they left\
  \ behind a battlefield of bloody massacred cadavers on the ground. Azem recounted\
  \ the story, walking us through their paths, smoldering anger in his eyes, as he\
  \ pointed the misfired bullets on the walls and glass cases. The Bardo museum had\
  \ made the decision not to hide their scars as a constant reminder of the attack.\
  \  \nBeing in the position of a tour guide, without a doubt, saved his life that\
  \ day. He thankfully managed to hurry his group in an underground catacomb. Even\
  \ though they heard the police firing shots, they had no way of knowing how many\
  \ terrorists there were. Knowing the police would shoot first and ask questions\
  \ later, they waited together the whole night. They only crawled out the next morning\
  \ when he heard his colleagues call his name, concrete proof everything was okay.\
  \ This experience left a mark on every survivor. The young German couple tragically\
  \ lost their baby and vowed never to come back to Tunisia. Although I sympathize\
  \ with their pain, I simultaneously feel it\u2019s unjustified to judge the country\
  \ based on this awful experience. Therapists were hired by the museum to help them\
  \ cope but Azem found alcohol to be the best coping mechanism. \nMy visit to the\
  \ museum, beautiful as it was, ended up being extremely bittersweet. I had never\
  \ felt as connected to my country before and I appreciated discovering our rich\
  \ history. As in most travels, meeting a local really made all the difference. Though\
  \ Tunisia\u2019s past is troubling, we must keep our minds open for the future.\
  \ I hope upcoming tourists will do the same: remember, but also be ready to give\
  \ a second chance to a picturesque country."
