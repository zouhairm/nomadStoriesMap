Text: "I was 18-years-old when I found out the best job in the world. Cirque du Soleil\
  \ came for the first time to my hometown in Brazil and I had the opportunity to\
  \ work with them as an usher. Since I stepped in to the Big Top, I knew that this\
  \ one will be the most challenging experience in my life. I could see every single\
  \ day the difference in the guests face\u2019s and mood before and after each show.\
  \ It\u2019s a real transformation! Be part of the most famous circus in the whole\
  \ world made me feel proud of myself and opened the door for a new entire life!\
  \ \nAnd I decided to ran away with the circus again and again!\nFirst, I moved to\
  \ S\xE3o Paulo to follow the Cirque du Soleil for 6 months. Then, Rio de Janeiro,\
  \ where I\u2019ve challenged myself to explore the Social Comunication market, area\
  \ of my graduation. It was on a vacations trip with my mom that my life had changed\
  \ completely. My next step would be huge, a real leap into the unknown: I\u2019\
  ve decided to move to Melbourne to work with the circus during the Australian Tour,\
  \ and also learn English from the begin. It was my first experience abroad Brazil!\
  \ \nNowadays, I\u2019m living in Sydney, improving my English and my skills to run\
  \ away and join Cirque du Soleil again! My dream is to travel around the world spreading\
  \ happiness everywhere!!\nWhat\u2019s your dream?"
