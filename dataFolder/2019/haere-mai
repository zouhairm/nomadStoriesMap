Text: "My first ever solo (kind of) journey without family was nerve wrecking yet\
  \ exciting. New Zealand have always been my dream destination to travel ever since\
  \ I watched Lord of the Rings. I remember arriving in Wellington with my schoolmates,\
  \ the first sharp inhale I took was absolutely refreshing I felt as if I was on\
  \ those chewing gum commercials when my nose cleared up. To be able to see the sky\
  \ without anything blocking  my view was phenomenal - the greenery and tiny houses\
  \ greeted me home. \nCompared to where I live, I was astonished and shy when strangers\
  \ spoke to me as if we known each other for quite awhile. It was the friendliest\
  \ place I ever been, people slow down to make conversation about almost everything.\
  \ One of the most common topics that occur is the weather, Wellington is well known\
  \ for it's unstable and exciting weather. It is one of the windiest cities in the\
  \ world and the wind is definitely strong to blow you away. \nThe biggest leap I\
  \ took when I was visiting the city was meeting my internet best friend (Risha)\
  \ after knowing her for 2 years, it felt surreal and it was as magical as a Disneyland\
  \ theme park experience anywhere on this world.\nWe went to Red Rocks and there\
  \ is a legend behind it as Risha explained - she told me the mountains got it's\
  \ red from Maui's blood as he used it as a fish bait when he caught the North Island.\
  \ \nAotearoa (New Zealand) is a beautiful place where you are surrounded with Maori\
  \ stories and legends which I assume is also one of the biggest inspiration for\
  \ the Disney film Moana where the Maori legend Maui appears. \nAnother place I went\
  \ was the Te Papa Museum where we saw the history of the Maori people and how it\
  \ affected them when colonization occurred. It was a sad moment for myself as Sri\
  \ Lanka was colonization as well and how the people got suppressed was a heart breaking\
  \ moment. As many of our cultural history was erased and there are no physical evidence\
  \ - just the anecdotal evidence that is passed on generation to generation.  We\
  \ saw a rare exhibit of a wharenui which is a Maori house, inside there are wooden\
  \ carvings of their ancestors, and all the descendants that got passed down from\
  \ the wharenui. It made me have goosebumps and great interest in the history each\
  \ wharenui. \nWe visited the Wellington Zoo where I saw many animals for the first\
  \ time in my life, I saw a kiwi bird which looks absolutely like the fruit but just\
  \ with a cute beak and tiny legs. Giraffes surprised me as I have only seen them\
  \ on television and they are like skyscrapers in Hong Kong. \nWellington is one\
  \ of the most magical city that made me feel like I belonged there, I hope someday\
  \ you could visit there too.  Aroha nui."
