Text: "\u201CToday I will go to La Boca.\"  Sheila, another guest at Faena Hotel,\
  \ agreed that a trip to La Boca should be a priority on my list of sites to see\
  \ while in Buenos Aires. During my week long stay, I mentioned to Sheila over breakfast\
  \ that I had been casually searching, while exploring the highly charged city, and\
  \ no Christmas ornaments were to be found. We met in the buffet line and both shared\
  \ our yen for the freshly baked buttery pastries, which we each lathered with freshly\
  \ churned sweet butter and homemade peach marmalade. The croissants were lifted\
  \ straight out of the clay oven each morning and perfectly perched among the bountiful\
  \ breakfast items that included prosciutto, smoked salmon, boiled eggs, an assortment\
  \ of olives and decanters of freshly made pineapple and orange juice .  \n I marked\
  \ the entire day for this outing. My flight home was tomorrow. I had to find a Christmas\
  \ ornament to mark my time spent. Sheila shared that she had taken a short day trip\
  \ to La Boca and spied several Christmas ornaments while shopping for family gifts.\
  \ It has become a treasured hobby now, collecting Christmas ornaments as I traverse\
  \ the globe. German Kugel, Christopher Radko and Bronner are among my collection.\
  \ I picked up the phone and dialed the front desk.\n \u201CBuenos Dias, Senor. How\
  \ far is it to La Boca?\u201D \n \u201CLo siento, Senorita. Today is not a good\
  \ day to venture far away. There is a citywide transportation strike. Public transportation\
  \ and taxi services are not running today,\u201D said the front desk attendant.\
  \ \u201CProtestors are scattered all around the city.\u201D\n\u201CDo you have a\
  \ bicycle?\u201D I asked. \n\u201CSi Senora, however I do not recommend taking a\
  \ bicycle to La Boca. I cannot guarantee your safety by bicycle,\u201D said the\
  \ attendant. \n \u201CI\u2019m from Detroit,\u201D I teased.\n\u201CDe donde?\u201D\
  \ asked the attendant. \n\u201CI\u2019m from Detroit,\u201D I repeated with confidence.\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019ll be ok.\u201D\n\u201CIt is a twelve-mile journey, Senora,\u201D\
  \ said the attendant.\n\u201CPor favor, prepare the bike,\u201D I said.\nI was greeted\
  \ by the concierge, Jose, in the lobby and asked to sign a no-fault waiver releasing\
  \ the hotel from any liability in the event of some unforeseen accident. She immediately\
  \ reviewed the document and signed. Jose took the signed document and filed it away.\n\
  \u201CPor favor, be careful,\u201D Jose said. \u201CAdios.\u201D\n\u201CHasta luego,\u201D\
  \ I said excitedly.\n I took the bike from its lazy lean against the wall. I looked\
  \ both ways, hesitated and called back to Jose, \u201CDonde esta La Boca?\u201D\
  \ Jose snorted and signaled to the left.\n\t\u201CMuchas Gracias,\u201D I replied.\n\
  \ I straddled the bike and pushed off. As I pedaled and picked up speed, I felt\
  \ the soothing, warm, humid breeze as it feathered against my sun burned skin. Today\
  \ I remembered to lather on sun screen. I felt fluttering in my stomach with each\
  \ push against the pedals. I was uncertain of any particular shop or even where\
  \ I was headed, I knew that I would find my Christmas ornament in La Boca, even\
  \ with the hotel attendant\u2019s warning ringing in my ears. Although my Spanish\
  \ was not that fluid, I possessed a decent sense of direction. Pedaling through\
  \ the city streets, I wound up riding along Plaza de San Diego. I whizzed by painted\
  \ structures in bright yellow, salmon and mint green and delighted in the architecture\
  \ and design of the aged structures. I felt a burst of adrenaline as I picked up\
  \ speed. Letting go of the handlebars, I spread open my arms like the wings on an\
  \ airplane. The tires seemingly lifted off the pavement and I was airborne. Soaring\
  \ over the city, I gleaned the old city gated behind ancient walls, people coddled\
  \ together sipping wine, eating tapas, laughing, holding hands. A mangy dog lazily\
  \ strolled along the street. Music poured from windows above the street serenading\
  \ pedestrians and bystanders. The smell of roasted meats and baked pastries wafted,\
  \ triggering embryonic hunger pangs. Now, I was unsure of which direction to head.\
  \ I spotted La Policia wearing a brightly colored neon vest. \u201CDonde esta La\
  \ Boca?\u201D I yelled. \u201CA la derecho,\u201D she yelled back and pointed. I\
  \ headed to the right,  to La Boca."
