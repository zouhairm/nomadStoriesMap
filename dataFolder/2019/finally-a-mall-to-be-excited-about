Text: "\u201CToo many people travel to experience the blacks and whites!\u201D the\
  \ man whose name I had missed was asserting. \u201CThey make these binary divisions\
  \ between \u2018tourist-traps\u2019 and \u2018authentic destinations\u2019 which\
  \ they perceive as uncorrupted by travellers. It\u2019s just snobbery. An eco-lodge\
  \ in the jungle can be as unethical as a package resort in Cancun, it\u2019s just\
  \ more exclusive!\u201D. He paused to inhale his Michelada. \u201CI want the greys!\
  \ The forsaken places! That\u2019s where you learn!\u201D.\n\nI chattered as enthusiastically\
  \ about visiting Bodie and Rhyolite, romanticised \u2018ghost towns\u2019 of goldrush\
  \ America.  All of us were in fervent agreement that urban decay can be poignant\
  \ because it brings forth reclamations by nature. \n\nTrying to understand the nuances\
  \ of Mexican culture had been akin to happening upon a game of Russian Roulette\
  \ and being expected to join in. Without knowing the rules. Who could have predicted\
  \ that lemonade would be made of limes in Mexico?  Would they have predicted a conversation\
  \ with a group of photographers, at a rooftop party, would lead to a day of breaking\
  \ and entering? \n\nAfter such a merry evening, it felt reasonable to agree to \u201C\
  explore Acropolis\u201D, a long-abandoned mall, the next morning. With a name taken\
  \ from the Greek, conjuring visions of grandeur and stone pillars\u2026 All somehow\
  \ obliquely linked to shopping. Who could resist?\n\nWe made up two carloads, my\
  \ girlfriend and I in one, with the couple who had invited us to the party. The\
  \ photographers, with their expensive sunglasses and freewheeling laughter, in the\
  \ other. Pulling up, we concurred Acropolis was sublime in its ridiculousness. \n\
  \nA true Vegas riff-off the genuine article. As imagined, there were steep stone\
  \ steps to the looming entrance of columns and hieroglyph inspired branding. Only\
  \ smashed glass and spray-painted scrawls indicated, in a universal language, that\
  \ it was disused. Open to enquiries. \n\nUnlike in the UK, it was easy to bypass\
  \ the warning signs and shimmy around hardboard intended to block access. Then like\
  \ greyhounds after the gunshot, we were off. Each of us drawn into our own bubbles\
  \ of thought, rocking and roaming, skimming fingertips over forgotten surfaces.\n\
  \nAcropolis had been falling into a state of disrepair for two decades, but in its\
  \ heyday imitated a bazaar, with open-fronted kiosks instead of traditional isolated\
  \ shops. I imagined how noisy it must have been, traders calling out to browsers\
  \ funnelled down aisles without turnoffs; the whines of whatever puppies happened\
  \ to be fashionable; an intermittent \u201CBueno\u201D boomed in response to a mobile\
  \ phone\u2019s demand.\n\nThe customers had gone but the kiosks retained their integrity;\
  \ each hosting graffiti. Some clamoured with competing images and messages; some\
  \ housed endless tags, and, in my favourites, you\u2019d find post-box-red grinning\
  \ animal heads, all lolling yellow tongues and playfulness. \n\nWe reconvened by\
  \ chance, all struck by light as the space abruptly opened. We stood in a concrete\
  \ emptiness with an improbably large glass ceiling above us, unmistakably shaped\
  \ like a star. It was engineered so that when the sun was at its zenith, it would\
  \ have been perfectly aligned to hit the centre and dazzle shoppers with a supernova\
  \ across the floor.\n\nMany sections were missing. Vast panels turned to grit beneath\
  \ our feet. The indulgent sky above acted as a glorious second ceiling.   The Acropolis\
  \ in Athens, masterminded by Pericles in the 5th Century BC, still stands. I pictured\
  \ him leering down at us in the beggarly snow globe imitation of his vision. \n\n\
  Naturally, when nobody else is around to watch, adults let their guard down in abandoned\
  \ places. Rules somehow suspended; the whole place our playground. We\u2019d already\
  \ emulated archaeologists, it seemed less fanciful to give modelling and role-play\
  \ a go. One of the aspiring auteurs produced a well-crafted jaguar mask. We traversed\
  \ balconies, attempted synchronised jumping and posed unabashedly, until a lone,\
  \ armed, security guard ambled in. \n\nThe Mexican faction of our group did some\
  \ sweet talking, and slick money exchanging, securing an extra 20 minutes for us\
  \ to explore. No voices were raised. \n\nOn departure, our paths crossed with the\
  \ band who\u2019d booked the venue for a video shoot. Our interest in urban decay\
  \ wasn\u2019t unique. But I doubted whether they\u2019d had the foresight to bring\
  \ a Jaguar mask. Amateurs."
