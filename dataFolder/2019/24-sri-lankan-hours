Text: "After years of working on thick skinned Wall Street and traveling the globe,\
  \ I thought I had seen it all and was immune to everything.  But a specific 24 hours\
  \ in Sri Lanka proved me wrong.\n\nDay one on the untouched island, we explored\
  \ the beauty of Colombo, took multiple selfies with locals (redish/blondish pale\
  \ females are not common), and had a drink with the man who has my dream job, Mr.\
  \ Anthony Bourdain.  \n\nVenturing off the tourist route, I attended a Sri Lankan\
  \ wedding, cooked with locals, brunched with elephants, explored ancient temples,\
  \ and snapped epic Instagram photos!  Life was good!  \n\nThat\u2019s when the worst\
  \ flood in decades hit Sri Lanka, displacing over 600,000 people and killing more\
  \ than 220.\n\nI immediately contacted American organizations asking if I could\
  \ help. The responses were disappointing, \u201Cno\u201D, \u201Cit\u2019s too dangerous\u201D\
  , \u201Cjust donate money\u201D, or no response at all.  Legally the responses made\
  \ sense, ethically they didn\u2019t.  \n\nThat\u2019s when my stubborn business\
  \ \u201Cif you can\u2019t do it, I will\u201D mentality overtook my vacation \u201C\
  roll with it\u201D mentality.  I never took \u201Cno\u201D as answer when dealing\
  \ with people's stocks, so how is it different when dealing with their life?\n\n\
  24 hours starts...\n\n8am: I chatted with my Airbnb host begging him to help me\
  \ find a way to assist the victims. Even with the language barrier, he understood\
  \ and agreed to gather supplies and deliver them to the victims, as long as I covered\
  \ the expenses.\n\n10am: Already in a store purchasing rice, toothbrushes, medicine,\
  \ spices, soap, etc.  Each package could feed a family for months. By 7pm, 40 eager\
  \ locals were at the house ready to help! It was astonishing how quickly the town\
  \ came together to volunteer.  The unstoppable assembly line of packaging and loading\
  \ over 400 bags into the trucks was completed at 1:30am.\n\n4am: 3 filled trucks,\
  \ 8 locals, and myself were on our way.  We arrived in a devastated remote town,\
  \ where help had not reached and I had been the only non Sri Lankan to visit, ever.\
  \  The school acted as a shelter where all ages bunked up in classrooms.  Within\
  \ minutes, hundreds of people appeared and lined up for food.  \n\nThe most memorable\
  \ was a 15 year boy, wearing a \u201CBe Strong and Courageous\u201D shirt, who witnessed\
  \ losing his entire family in a mudslide. He took my hand and showed me unforgettable\
  \ images of his parents lifeless bodies half buried in mud. I wanted to run away\
  \ and close my eyes and make someone else take over.  Instead I stood there paralyzed,\
  \ unable to blink for fear of tears falling staring in disbelief. He then escorted\
  \ me to the area where they perished, lives were still missing, trees didn\u2019\
  t exist, and newly created waterfalls & rivers had formed.  Absolutely devastating,\
  \ yet he stayed strong...and courageous.\n\nAt the 3rd village, rain poured down\
  \ as locals hustled to remove drying clothes from trees.  I walked door to door\
  \ with a Monk, communicating only with smiles.  We glided through the mud, over\
  \ logs that replaced fallen bridges, delivering packages. With barely any food of\
  \ their own, they offered me rice curry wrapped in newspaper and climbed trees to\
  \ gift me fruit. With no shelter, they still walked for miles with umbrellas trying\
  \ to keep me dry.  Selfless.\n\nI recall the heart melting smile of a 90 year old\
  \ man, who paused rebuilding his house to greet us. His frail, almost naked body,\
  \ was camouflaged by his beautiful soul. The $8.50 package (almost as big as he\
  \ was) was now his only physical possession, yet he continued to smile.    \n\n\
  I remember every humble face, genuine hug, tight hand squeeze and thankful smile\
  \ during those 24 hours.\n\nToday, as I write this, I\u2019m sitting at a Manhattan\
  \ Starbucks sipping on my $6 drink, with views of day old slush and sounds of honking\
  \ horns.  My toe throbs because it got crushed by a unapologetic Subway rider, the\
  \ guy next to me is chewing with his mouth open, the kid behind me kicked my chair\
  \ so hard that i\u2019m wearing most of mocha, the wifi keeps disconnecting and\
  \ yet I can\u2019t help but smile...because I have no reason not to."
