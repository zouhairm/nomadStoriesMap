Text: "Funny how things turn out to be. In one of the most hot and liberal countries\
  \ out there, at least in a country in which people dance almost fully naked at times,\
  \ traditionalist politicians can make some dreams quite hard to achieve.\n   There,\
  \ people are not free at all, but they do try... God knows their struggle, and God\
  \ knows what I've seen and the things I've lived in Rio. What a beautiful, joyful\
  \ place to be! But what an awful place to be born... A nightmare indeed, though\
  \ a colourful and bright nightmare!\n   The cockroaches enjoy the seasons just as\
  \ much as we do, and the hot weather makes it easier for all the beings who want\
  \ some action. Little monkeys drifting around the power cables, and the birds singing\
  \ to the sun itself. Mosquitoes are looking for blood, but the sand and the sea\
  \ can make a pretty safe zone for us humans, and whenever we want, the coasts will\
  \ receive the hardened and yet optimistic souls.\n   I know one thing for sure:\
  \ we are all equally fond to happiness, but some authorities sure will reinforce\
  \ sadness in the Marvelous City, but you know, only if you can't share your happiness\
  \ with them. Bribery is a common and almost safe course of action, because, like\
  \ I said, we are all equally fond to happiness. And how happy they are! The colossal\
  \ Cristo Redentor smiles while crying, and the streets show the same amount of flowers\
  \ and blood, hope and fear.\n   Cigarettes shine all night long, and the music is\
  \ alive, forcing the wind itself to dance around our bodies. The bottles reflect\
  \ the fire in our eyes, and the stars, oh, the stars!... They can tell us the future,\
  \ some say. Nonetheless, it's certain that the stars can show us the present. Our\
  \ eyes gaze into the infinitude of this profound sky, and the brave children of\
  \ this country are just as peaceful as you are to them. The nights are good companions,\
  \ and the days are whatever you want them to be. For a good traveler, there's no\
  \ solitude in Rio de Janeiro, for a pure soul, there's no danger in wandering under\
  \ the mysteries of the moonlight.\n   The pain of knowing the truth and the great\
  \ pleasure of meeting a nice and young spirit to spend the evening with... The aches\
  \ of living aren't actually that great, not after knowing the glorious Brazilian\
  \ way. The \"malandragem\", the love, the fun, the disease... \"Our hearts can't\
  \ be caged\", the city says, \"our guts will always be greater than your authority\"\
  .\n   See, Rio de Janeiro isn't somewhere to just go and visit, but it is, in fact,\
  \ a place for discoveries, a place in which you can rebuild your faith, or even\
  \ put it to test. There's one thing, and one thing only, that this cosmopolitan,\
  \ god forgotten and unique city can teach any one of us: some people can get softer\
  \ and, at the same time, more conscious of their own necessities if you hit them\
  \ for enough time. Our souls tend to be good, and if you don't believe me, you surely\
  \ have never lived this experience called Rio de Janeiro.\n   Tasting the sweet,\
  \ sweet irony of things, I've managed to learn, to love, to be... And, finally,\
  \ to meet myself while listening and watching others. Few places are hotter than\
  \ a tropical city, but for a fearless person, there are plenty of arms, chests,\
  \ breasts, legs, lips and souls with a love even hotter then fire, just waiting\
  \ for us to finally reach them.\n   I didn't know, being raised in a cold region,\
  \ how warm can Heaven be!"
