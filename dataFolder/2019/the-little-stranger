Text: "Our afternoon of paddle boarding was drawing to a close as the sun began to\
  \ set over Koh Tao\u2019s beach, the deepening indigo sky signalling our return\
  \ to the shore. Although we cruised back aimlessly, laughing as Emma attempted to\
  \ do a handstand on her board: \u201CI\u2019m gonna fall, I\u2019m gonna fall, I\u2019\
  m gonna\u2014AHHH!\u201D and then falling off in quite a magnificent style, there\
  \ was a certain poignancy amongst us. It was our last night together before our\
  \ travelling foursome divided into two; Emma and Faye were heading to Koh Samui,\
  \ while Lizzie and I were off to Koh Phi Phi and soon after, home to England. Paddle\
  \ boarding had seemed like the perfect farewell activity: taking in the views across\
  \ the bay, just enjoying each other\u2019s company.\n\n    Emma\u2019s head popped\
  \ up from the water and she scrambled back on her board with a desperate look at\
  \ Lizzie, \u201CPLEASE tell me you got that on camera?!\u201D. The look on Lizzie\u2019\
  s face clearly revealed that she did not have the handstand on camera. We all laughed\
  \ as Emma collapsed back onto her board in feigned anguish, exclaiming \u201CThe\
  \ things I do for Instagram!\u201D. \n \n      No photo could have done that sky\
  \ justice however. A few feet from the shore we sat bobbing on our paddle boards,\
  \ looking out to the horizon and waiting for the sun to set. It was in this moment\
  \ that I felt my board jolt. I steadied myself as Lizzie laughed, \u201CIt looks\
  \ like you\u2019ve got a visitor, Melissa\u201D. Indeed, I had. I turned around\
  \ to find a little stranger on the end of my board; a Thai boy sat smiling up at\
  \ me. \n   \u201CHello there! And what might your name be?\u201D I asked. He didn\u2019\
  t understand English, but I got a giggle in response. He pulled himself up on my\
  \ arm and poised himself at the board\u2019s edge. He turned to me expectantly,\
  \ making sure only to jump when he was positive that he had my full attention. When\
  \ he was certain that I was completely undistracted, he let out a delighted \u201C\
  Weeeeeee!\u201D and leapt off the board. A few moments later the water bubbled as\
  \ he emerged giggling and spluttering. \n   \n     He continued to do so, again\
  \ and again, stretching his hands out of the water for me to haul him back up and\
  \ then, SPLASH he was in again, reaping endless enjoyment from acting like a human\
  \ canon-ball. Human canon-ball then turned into seafaring explorer, bringing me\
  \ back only the finest seaside treasures. He dived down under the water and sprang\
  \ back up gleefully with his little hands cupping a mound of sand. He handed me\
  \ his little sand piles and I dutifully cooed over each one, \u201CWow! So pretty!\u201D\
  . He placed more sand piles around me until the board pattern was polka dot from\
  \ head to foot. \u201CA masterpiece!\u201D Faye declared. \n    \n     The sun burst\
  \ as it finally hit the horizon, engulfing the sea in gold and orange and red. Any\
  \ onlookers at that moment would have seen our four silhouettes sat against the\
  \ sunset, taking it all in, while a small and dainty fifth silhouette danced from\
  \ board to board and splashed about like a little sea fairy. He spoke to me and\
  \ I spoke to him, but the only mutually understandable sound existing between us\
  \ was our laughter.\n \n      Eventually, the sun was gone and the time had come\
  \ for us to return our boards. Our new friend seemed a little perplexed as we dragged\
  \ our boards out of the water. Regretfully, we turned and waved goodbye. He waved\
  \ sadly and ducked his head under the water\u2019s surface and was gone, as though\
  \ he had been a magical sea creature all along. We hadn\u2019t been walking up the\
  \ beach long however when I felt a delicate tap on my thigh. Delighted, we found\
  \ the boy had returned. I crouched down as he held out his hand to me bashfully,\
  \ uncurling his tiny fingers to reveal four seashells. He carefully placed one in\
  \ my palm, then Emma\u2019s, then Faye\u2019s, then lizzie\u2019s- one for each\
  \ of us. Before we even had a chance to say anything, the little stranger was already\
  \ running joyfully back into the sea."
