Text: "The excitement overwhelmed my soul like a jolt of electricity coursing through\
  \ my body. The endless 15 hour flight drew near to its every approaching arrival,\
  \ Auckland airport, New Zealand. The passing clouds seemed to encourage my hearts\
  \ persistent hammer as they formed long cluster shapes with minimal gaps, limiting\
  \ my view of the land and life that lurked below.  Another moment and I hear the\
  \ overhead voice of the captain, indicating our descent into the unknown land below.\
  \ Glee fills my face as the couple next to me notice and inquire if this is my first\
  \ time to New Zealand. \u201CNo,\u201D I say. \u201CI grew up here. It\u2019s been\
  \ 10 years but I\u2019m finally coming home.\u201D The smile never leaving my face\
  \ as we continue short pleasantries. I return my gaze back to the window where the\
  \ clouds had been teasing me with short views of my old home. The green hills come\
  \ into view, ever quick they approach with specs of colour upon them. The ocean\
  \ which once seemed like an endless barrier is now dancing upon the shore as if\
  \ beckoning me to frolic within its fierce grasp. The roar of the plane snaps me\
  \ back into the reality of where I am and I realized those distance specks of colour\
  \ hugging the hills is in fact the fast approaching airport, landing area and industrial\
  \ buildings that separate the airport from the rest of Auckland\u2019s bustling\
  \ habitat. Emerging from the plane I hear the hum of accents and languages as people\
  \ canter from gate to gate. My heart is lifted as I proceed to baggage claim. \u201C\
  I am here!\u201D my heart screams. I am sure I must have been an odd sight to behold,\
  \ pale, fatigued and unkempt but an ever present smile expanding on my face. I continued\
  \ through the throngs of people which were considerably less than the hustle of\
  \ LAX- Los Angeles. Emerging from immigration and security, I claim my bulging suitcase,\
  \ missing zip and torn sides, toting away the items that I have reduce my life into.\
  \ Stepping outside the doors I look around at the random faces of people waiting\
  \ to see their loved ones and friends. Knowing that I do not know anyone in Auckland,\
  \ I feel my smile slowly fade but I continue onward. I find a small area to sit\
  \ and wait and rest as I watch the beauty of reconnection unfold in front of me.\
  \ The squeaks, squeals and shouts of people reuniting. This alone returns the smile\
  \ to my face. Time slowly passes and an older woman perhaps in her late 50\u2019\
  s approaches me and in broken English manages to ask if I am Rebecah? She identifies\
  \ herself as my aunt, trying her best to speak the little English she knows and\
  \ hoping that I understand her Samoan. I confirm and walk with her into the unknown.\
  \ Into the next adventure that life brings, meeting new people, family or friends\
  \ and discovering a new city, a new land, a land that always felt like home."
