Text: "\u201CPara ti\u201D, the young girl softly said to me as she gingerly placed\
  \ fresh guacamole and boiled potatoes on the colourful wooden table in front of\
  \ me. Her name was Raymi*, and as we sat in the darkened concrete room, lit only\
  \ by the doorway, it was evident that we came from different worlds.\n\nRaymi was\
  \ sixteen and already a mother, the reality for twenty percent of youth under nineteen\
  \ in Peru. She had already seen the less glamorous Peruvian sights\u2026forced to\
  \ leave her community and culture, everything she was\u2026behind, to work in dangerous\
  \ mines in unsafe conditions, earning little money, just to support her family.\n\
  \nBut she was not the only one with this story.  \n\nLittle did she know, prior\
  \ to leaving and getting pregnant, before I met her, I sat down with locals in her\
  \ town of Pisac. The cold morning air touched my face as I took another difficult\
  \ breath due to the high altitude.  This town, situated in the foothills of the\
  \ Andean mountains, was full of potential, yet locals were struggling.\n\nI spoke\
  \ with mothers who wake their children up at five every morning, not for school,\
  \ but to get them ready to work in the market. The days were long and the money\
  \ little. Mothers carried their youngest on their back in a lliclla, a hand-woven\
  \ scarf decorated with intricate designs and hues of rich reds and yellows. Mothers\
  \ were forced to exploit their children\u2019s charm by dressing them in traditional\
  \ clothing, posing with baby lambs for tourists or helping sell authentic hand-crafted\
  \ goods. \n\n***\n\nBefore meeting Raymi, I worked with a school to implement an\
  \ entrepreneurial curriculum and met Catequil*, a timid teenage boy with long hair,\
  \ always secured in a braid. After seeing the new curriculum\u2019s value, he returned\
  \ from the mines to pursue his education and graduate. The students were deeply\
  \ impacted and opened a garden, the first in Pisac. Catequil became the garden manager,\
  \ leading the co-op program that provided education and an income for students.\
  \ \n\nCatequil\u2019s success transformed him from a shy, introverted individual\
  \ to a passionate community leader that elevated him into becoming a role model\
  \ for Raymi. She returned from the mines and realized this education could help\
  \ her gain employable skills to earn an income. Catequil used the train-the-trainer\
  \ approach to lead educational workshops, mentoring Raymi to replace him as garden\
  \ manager since Catequil has now decided to pursue post-secondary education in Canada.\n\
  \nThe students have acquired an additional piece of land to farm quinoa, where young\
  \ single mothers like Raymi, will be employed to work and support their children.\
  \ Students like Catequil and Raymi no longer must work in the mines. \n\n***\n\n\
  The youth are pursuing business opportunities on their own and are excited to take\
  \ risks and grow their entrepreneurial spirit. They needed to feel empowered with\
  \ hope and a choice for a better tomorrow. Raymi was one of them. Wearing a colourful\
  \ pollera, a wide skirt and a montera, a hat adorned with beads, she sat down to\
  \ tell me her story. \n\nShe was enrolled in school but left to support her parents\
  \ when they fell sick and could not provide for Raymi and her younger sister, forcing\
  \ her to become the sole-provider. Raymi worked in the mines, ultimately became\
  \ pregnant and returned to Pisac, where she felt isolated from her community. She\
  \ no longer felt Andean, was still uneducated and had to provide for her family.\
  \ \n\nIt was because of the education provided to her that she was able to change\
  \ her life. \n\n\u201CGracias,\u201D Raymi humbly told me. \n\nI connected with\
  \ these individuals\u2026looked into their eyes\u2026into their souls. I listened\
  \ to their stories and communicated in my broken Spanish. They did not mind. They\
  \ were just waiting for someone to listen. \n\nI had hoped to empower the youth,\
  \ to give them an option outside of working in the mines or markets - an option\
  \ of education. It is more than Raymi and Catequil, it is about the mindset of an\
  \ entire community that was inspired to break the cycle of poverty and truly empower\
  \ its youth through education, entrepreneurship and the choice of a more promising\
  \ future. \n\n* names have been changed"
