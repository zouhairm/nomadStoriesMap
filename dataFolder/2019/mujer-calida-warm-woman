Text: "As I trudged through the river that had once been a walking trail, I pondered\
  \ on my recent discovery of the true meaning of 'waterproof'. Apparently it does\
  \ not mean impervious to water. Well maybe it does, but in the case of this damn\
  \ jacket it should come with an asterisk that reads *for about 30 minutes. That's\
  \ how long it lasted before the rain began to soak through, dampening my my body\
  \ and my spirits. \n\nIn the motivation that comes with morning, it had seemed like\
  \ a good idea to 'make the most of the day' despite the persistent downpour. A group\
  \ of us caught a bus from the hostel up to a National Park in Chilean Patagonia\
  \ for a hike. Donning our jackets and dorky waterproof pants we thought ourselves\
  \ invincible to the weather. Oh how naive. Barely an hour in to the 5 hour hike\
  \ we were miserable, soaked to the bone and numb to the point of genuine concern\
  \ for the longevity of our extremities. All of us were miserable, that is, expect\
  \ Sue. Sue, the ever overly-enthusiastic middle aged Australian mother. She gushes\
  \ about what a great time she is having, and how we should all perk up a bit. I\
  \ love you Sue, but please shut up. I'm too down to even stop for a soggy sandwich,\
  \ powering on through the forest.\n\nA few of us decide to turn back early, trying\
  \ to make the 2pm bus back to town. Despite some Olympic level power-walking back\
  \ the way we came, the bus trundles off seconds before we arrive. The next bus isn't\
  \ for 3 hours. Wonderful. A sympathetic ranger spots us wallowing in our misery\
  \ and makes a call. He tells us to head five minutes further up the road where we\
  \ will find a campsite. He promises there we will find some shelter. Off we set,\
  \ along the gravel path towards what we hope will be our saving grace. A few hundred\
  \ metres up the road we find her, la mujer c\xE1lida. She welcomes us into her home,\
  \ urgently ushering us into her little kitchen. She doesn't know a word of English,\
  \ and our Spanish is limited to a very few fairly useless pleasantries. Despite\
  \ the language barrier, we understand she is telling us to strip off our layers\
  \ and when we do, she hangs them up for us to try. As she rushes around the kitchen\
  \ to make us coffee, we huddle around the lit AGA in an attempt to warm up. La mujer\
  \ c\xE1liente proudly serves us each a cup of coffee and a slice of cheesecake.\
  \ In an instant our hearts warm up to melting point. As we fill our stomachs, we\
  \ watch a Chilean soap that is playing on a tiny TV in the corner. La mujer c\xE1\
  lida is very invested in the show. We have great fun trying to understand what is\
  \ going on, and la mujer c\xE1lida sees what we are doing, and together we all share\
  \ a giggle.\n\nAs the arrival of the 5pm bus draws nearer, we don our (slightly)\
  \ dry clothes and shoes and thank la mujer c\xE1lida for her hospitality in broken\
  \ and probably incomprehensible Spanish, paying her a few thousand pesos for her\
  \ trouble. Although we shared no more than a few words during our stay, I left feeling\
  \ some sort of connection with this kind old woman, who had welcomed us gringos\
  \ in out of the goodness of her heart. As we drove back to civilisation, I reflected\
  \ on the day feeling thankful for the warmth we found, that reached from the tips\
  \ of our defrosting toes and the way into our hearts. \n\nLa mujer c\xE1lida, muchas\
  \ gracias."
