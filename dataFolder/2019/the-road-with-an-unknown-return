Text: "I have a picture on my table at our newsroom. More correctly, there are a few,\
  \ but one of these paintings depicts two girls with flags in their hands. The girls\
  \ are drawn in irregular lines, and by only looking at them one can figure out that\
  \ the author of the painting is a child.\n\nHer name is Nare, and she is a 5-year-old\
  \ girl, who lives in a small village of Vazashen, at the border between Armenia\
  \ and Azerbaijan. Their house is located a few meters away from the Azerbaijani\
  \ frontier guards, which often shoot at the house.\n\nOnce me and our photographer\
  \ decided to make a short trip to their home and find out how it feels like living\
  \ so close and so far from war. We called our journey \u201CThe road with an unknown\
  \ return\u201D.\n\nVazashen village, situated in the north-east of Ijevan in the\
  \ northern part of Armenia, runs its daily routine under the adversary\u2019s constant\
  \ gunfire, staying on the verge of war and peace. There are only 15 families living\
  \ in this village. Nare\u2019s grandmother, grandfather, mother, father, and two\
  \ sisters live here in the same little house.\n\nThree sisters attend a local school.\
  \ Sophie, aged 11, and Vika, 13, study in the same class, while Nare is still in\
  \ the first grade. There are 43 pupils at this school, and 20 are coming from neighboring\
  \ villages.\n\nAt school, the number of both teachers and students is insignificant,\
  \ so children of 6,7,8,9 grades learn the same subjects at the same time in the\
  \ same classroom. Another peculiarity of the school is the availability of special\
  \ shelters.\n\n\u201CWe know how to hide there. It is necessary to shout strongly\
  \ and run with the teacher in the cellar to wait until the shooting ends. Then you\
  \ can go home,\u201D says Nare, 5.\n\nMargo is the kids\u2019 grandmother, who takes\
  \ the children from school every day. This time we traveled the two-kilometer route\
  \ together.\n\nUp to the 1990s the road, where we walked, stretched to the Azerbaijani\
  \ village of Bala Jafarli. Armenians and Azeris were once engaged in cattle-breeding\
  \ together. Now mined areas divide the Armenian and Azerbaijani villages.  We were\
  \ standing at the point, where Armenian and Azerbaijani positions could be seen\
  \ a few hundred meters away.\n\n\u201CI will not go this way. From here, they have\
  \ a clear view of our street,\u201D suddenly said Nare.\n\nOn the way, in the corner\
  \ of the street, children\u2019s grandmother showed a ruined building.\n\n\u201C\
  This was our home, which was destroyed during the war, and we had to move to that\
  \ other house that belonged to our neighbor. Now it\u2019s really hard to live in\
  \ a house in front of your own home,\u201D said Margo.\n\nWe got home already tired.\
  \ The mother of the children said that if people decide to go and shoot a movie\
  \ there, they can film how the children are going to school, climbing and running,\
  \ and how all people of this village are dreaming that their children get a good\
  \ education and become important people. Everyone dreams that one day their village\
  \ will be visited by tourists.\n\nAt home, Nare begins to do her homework in math\
  \ and draw a picture. Suddenly she remembers that she did not say a very important\
  \ thing - that she knows how to defend herself during shooting, she just needs to\
  \ start painting at that moment.\n\nEvery time, when the opponent is activated,\
  \ Nare\u2019s family start to think about moving out from there to at least two\
  \ districts farther. But then Artak, the children\u2019s father, urges the children\
  \ to sing a joyful song under the sound of shooting. \n\n\u201CWe sing, then we\
  \ go home, sleep, wake up in the morning, stand on the stairs, look at our lands,\
  \ and say \u201Cno\u201D, we will not go anywhere. We cannot live away from home,\u201D\
  \ Sophie said.\n \n\u201CNare, do you want to go?\u201D Vika asked Nare.\n\nNare\
  \ shook her head; she was painting two girls for me with a flag in their hands."
