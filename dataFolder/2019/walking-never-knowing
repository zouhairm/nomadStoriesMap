Text: "Walking has always been a way of life since as far back as I can remember.\
  \ I cannot always remember where we were going, but we had to walk fast and ask\
  \ very little questions. My mother would tell us to get shoes on and we were off.\
  \ Walking was out of necessity and not a preferred method of travel. Mother was\
  \ afraid to drive and Dad wasn\u2019t around alot to transport.\n\nNow, I almost\
  \ prefer walking to driving. You see much more; you breathe in the streets and taste\
  \ the neighborhoods. I take this approach when traveling to new places. I have never\
  \ rented a car and don\u2019t plan to in the future. Sounds are lost, roads all\
  \ look the same and connecting with the locals is virtually nonexistent. Besides,\
  \ who doesn\u2019t like to get lost canal side in Amsterdam? Or take a wrong turn\
  \ in Dublin? You find a pub, have a drink and figure it out!\n\nIt took me a very\
  \ long time to get to a place in life where I could travel. Growing up, it just\
  \ wasn\u2019t an option. The thought wasn\u2019t feasible. The only new places we\
  \ saw were when we had to move into different apartments because rent couldn\u2019\
  t be made. \n\nI have earned every trip I take. Granted, there haven\u2019t been\
  \ many but I have years to fill up my passport. Writing was a thing I did in my\
  \ spare time but now, I would like to combine the two passions into something special.\
  \ \n\nThank you."
