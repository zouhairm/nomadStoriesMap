Text: "Contributing to Sydney\u2019s dazzling skyline and character is the stunning\
  \ Harbour Bridge. Her essence nearly as much a signature as the Opera House\u2019\
  s, she undoubtedly stirs up some feelings when eyes laid upon. Whether for a Sydneyan\
  \ returning home or a tourist about to step first foot upon Australian ground, both\
  \ will engage in the same sensation that first glimpse brings: I have made it.\n\
  For me being a tourist that excitement rushed through me as soon as I spotted the\
  \ bridge from my airplane window. Extremely eager to discover I pinpointed her soon\
  \ down to be one of my first visits. \nAnd so I did visit, although only having\
  \ been there once I feel like I have two stories to tell.\n\nThe Harbour Bridge\
  \ Fantasy\nMy small backpack stacked with heaps of water and lunch I started climbing\
  \ the steps of one of the most iconic buildings in Sydney: the Harbour Bridge. The\
  \ stones held the pressure of thousands of people encountering them daily, warmed\
  \ up by the sun on this particular January afternoon. Here I put my feet where before\
  \ me so many had put their being, climbing the steps of this gem in Sydney\u2019\
  s skyline. I couldn\u2019t believe I was actually here, fascinated with the unknown\
  \ and the new. The people mumbling in fascination around me, enjoying, taking pictures.\
  \ Gently I placed my hands upon the banister, enchanted by the ships bobbing the\
  \ small waves of the Tasman Sea. Overlooking the harbour with the bridges steel\
  \ skeleton of arches majestically above me crowning the sky, carrying the daredevils\
  \ brave enough to climb. Walking the over a kilometre long bridge new accents sang,\
  \ I smelled the sweetness of Australian air and my heart seemed to pulse upon relief,\
  \ upon freedom. The view was so gorgeous, truly a once in a lifetime experience,\
  \ so detailed and far stretched with the infrastructure playing in levels. With\
  \ the water flowing beneath me and the Opera House in sight, the day nice and promising,\
  \ my feet upon what I had only known from pictures and yearned for so long it could\
  \ not have been any more impressive. \nThe Sydney Harbour Bridge. \n\nThe Harbour\
  \ Bridge Reality \nMy small backpack stacked with heaps of water and lunch I started\
  \ climbing the steps onto one of the most iconic buildings in Sydney: the Harbour\
  \ Bridge. The stones held the pressure of thousands of people encountering them\
  \ daily, warmed up by the sun on this particular January afternoon. They also held\
  \ me hostage between those thousands. I ducked a necessary amount of times to avoid\
  \ a Chinese tourist\u2019s rusted selfie stick whilst they took pictures without\
  \ looking what of. Tripping and with a lot of \u2018sorry, excuse me\u2019 I climbed\
  \ higher up this gem of Sydney\u2019s skyline. Meanwhile the people\u2019s mumbling\
  \ faded into a more forceful roar of consistent traffic crossing the eight lanes\
  \ on the bridge. On the sides the signs \u2018WARNING: UNAUTHORIZED CLIMBING OF\
  \ THE BRIDGE IS PROHIBITED RESULTING A FINE OF $3.300\u2019 threatening me. Her\
  \ steel skeleton of arches above me crowning the sky, carrying daredevils brave\
  \ enough to climb the bridge in clouds of exhaust gas. Walking over the kilometre\
  \ long bridge I heard tourists screeching, the cars honking. I smelled sweat and\
  \ gasoline in the Australian air whilst my heart seemed to pulse in confusion, maybe\
  \ a little disappointment. The view gorgeous when ignoring the mesh and peering\
  \ through, so detailed and far stretched with infrastructure playing in levels.\
  \ With the water flowing beneath me and the Opera House in sight, the day nice and\
  \ promising, my feet upon what I had only known from pictures people definitely\
  \ had not taken from the bridge, it could not have been any more impressive.\nThe\
  \ Sydney Harbour Bridge."
