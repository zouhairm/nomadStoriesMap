Text: "In 2014 I traveled to Barcelona for a music festival and decided to take a\
  \ side-trip to Madrid a few days before the festival started. I figured this would\
  \ be a good way to see more of Spain on my first visit. The first night in Madrid\
  \ was crazy as both of the city's soccer teams were playing each other and all of\
  \ Madrid was worked into a frenzy. After a tasty dinner with my AirBnB host, I ventured\
  \ out to meet someone I'd been chatting with on Tinder in hopes of smoking a joint\
  \ and eating churros. When I got to Tender Dude's apartment, there wasn't a churro\
  \ to been seen and the joint was a mix of tobacco and weed which isn't my jam. I\
  \ tried to make the best of the churro-less situation and listened to some Radiohead\
  \ and chatted, but I felt bamboozled and more determined than ever to find my late-night\
  \ churros, so I left.\n\nThe following evening I took off to find Chocolateria San\
  \ Gines to get my churro-fix. Unfortunately, Google Maps had me walking in circles\
  \ in the general area of the Chocolateria. This went on for long enough that I looked\
  \ like a tourist-target and started paying attention to all the shady stuff happening\
  \ around me on the corner. I wasn't surprised when a guy approached me, asking for\
  \ the time. Instead of answering him, even though my phone was in my hand, I turned\
  \ his question back on him which seemed to shock him. I explained that I'd already\
  \ noticed his phone on one of my circles around the corner and that he shouldn't\
  \ need to ask me. I sized him up as we chatted and he asked me where I was going.\
  \ Still not convinced that he wasn't a hobo or a derelict, I hesitantly shared where\
  \ I was going and he offered to take me to the Chocolateria in exchange for sharing\
  \ my churros and hot chocolate with him. I asked him what his angle was and told\
  \ him if there was any funny business I'd stab him in the throat. \"Abrillllll,\
  \ you should be more trusting\" he said, which caused me to explain what it's like\
  \ to be a woman traveling alone. I love talking to weirdos, but I need to feel safe\
  \ at all costs. He nodded and said he understood and led me to churros. \n\nWhen\
  \ we arrived, the intoxicating smell of hot chocolate and fried dough made me giddy.\
  \ The overwhelming Spanishness of it all was almost to much to handle. Pedro the\
  \ Cattle Salesman and I shared churros and hot chocolate as planned and then went\
  \ to a nearby after-hours bar for a drink. He had a beer and I smoked a joint. Pedro\
  \ offered to walk me across the city to my AirBnB and I accepted. On the long walk\
  \ to my place, Pedro gave me an after-hours, mini-tour of the city, pointing out\
  \ famous statues, and government buildings, while I smoked a joint and reveled in\
  \ the moment. I was stoned in a foreign country, walking off my churros with a very\
  \ interesting stranger. We talked about food and life over a few miles before we\
  \ arrived back at my place. I kissed him goodnight and went upstairs alone. The\
  \ next day Pedro called to invite me to a bullfight where we'd get to eat the losing\
  \ bull after the fight. I know bull fighting is terrible but this is something that\
  \ I'd consider a once in a lifetime offer. Sadly, I had to turn down the offer because\
  \ I had other plans. Pedro hung up on me angrily and I sighed and laughed and went\
  \ on with my trip. \n\nIt's been 5 years and Pedro still calls to check on me, and\
  \ laughs at me for smoking too much weed and says, \"Abrillllllll, you should have\
  \ come to the bullfight\"."
