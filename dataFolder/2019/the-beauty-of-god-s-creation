Text: "Hello, my name is Dwi Kartika i'm 22 years old .. I'm from Indonesia I was\
  \ born in Jakarta and I live in Jakarta Indonesia. I really love traveling.  \n\
  because with travel we can find out every history that exists in this world that\
  \ not many people know. I like traveling because I am a person who wants to know\
  \ very well how other people live and work in other places, places I have never\
  \ visited, with trips I can learn and know various kinds of customs and cultures\
  \ in every corner, can understand how to respect religious differences So, race\
  \ and culture, me and others can share the social good, can understand how to love\
  \ each other living creatures receive the blessings and shortcomings that are available\
  \ in this world I like to share the love of kindness and find out the history of\
  \ the world that I have never known. Thank you to someone who wants to give time\
  \ to read my story, I'm sorry because I know my English is not good but at least\
  \ I'm trying to reach my dream, because since I was little I had dreams so that\
  \ I could fly out of the country and see the beauty of natural beauty and various\
  \ kinds the life that God has created is just that I was born from a poor family.\
  \ even if I don't win, at least I have tried to reach my dream. I believe God has\
  \ his own plans to realize the dreams of ordinary people like me but have strong\
  \ dreams to achieve them."
