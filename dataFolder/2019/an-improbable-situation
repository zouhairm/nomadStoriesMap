Text: "Think about an improbable situation, the strangest ever. Then think about two\
  \ girls from Rome and a bunch of thirty Mexicans in Sicily. Pretty close, isn\u2019\
  t it?\nYou may be wondering why those people came all the way from Mexico to perform\
  \ in a small town unknown even to the very Sicilians. The answer is no matter where,\
  \ no matter how tired they were, they said they simply love to dance. \nAnd you\
  \ might be wondering why those two girls decided to join them in this exhausting\
  \ tour de force: no answer provided.\nBut it turned out to be much more than we\
  \ all could have imagined.\nAt first, it was hard. Hard to communicate, hard to\
  \ get on well with their rhythms, their no-rush attitude. Most of them didn\u2019\
  t speak English, and, as Jesus immediately understood, \u201CChiara espa\xF1ol nada,\
  \ Sara espa\xF1ol poquitito\u201D. \nOrganization was pure chaos: we know nothing\
  \ but than we were in a small town, Comitini, near Agrigento \u2013the ancient Valle\
  \ dei Templi \u2013, and that they \u2013 the \u201CBallet folkl\xF3rico de la Ciudad\
  \ de Monterrey\u201D -- had been invited to perform in a festival with folkloristics\
  \ dance groups from all over the world.\nI must admit, we panicked many times, but\
  \ even in the worst scenario, we laughed so heartily together that the craziest\
  \ night-drive became something we\u2019ll always remember with a smile.\nIt all\
  \ begun in Custonaci, another small town near Trapani. We went there with the French\
  \ and the Colombians to participate in the 28th Folkloric Festival. Hosted by the\
  \ locals, we got the most genuine imagine of Sicily. They make us the best pasta\
  \ alla Norma for lunch, they wanted to share with us their traditions. And we spoke\
  \ to an old lady that told us something about the Second World War and the procession\
  \ that was to be held that night, but it was impossible to fully understand her\
  \ strict Sicilian dialect. And we and the Mexicans ate the brioche with ice-cream,\
  \ and I can tell you, we were sincerely happy! \nBack to reality: we had to get\
  \ ready for the show and there was still so much to be fixed up right\u2026 \nFirst:\
  \ run through the city to bring the group together; second: head back on the back\
  \ of a pick-up to collect the luggage (honestly, it wasn\u2019t necessary to sit\
  \ on the back but I was so thrilled that they let me); then go on the bus all cramped\
  \ together, the feathers of the Mexicans\u2019 costumes\u2019 hat tickled the nose\
  \ of the French\u2026 finally, the procession began! We all walked through the whole\
  \ city, followed by a Carretto Siciliano with children throwing away sweeties. When\
  \ we reached the stage, Mexicans, Colombians, Frenchs, and Sicilians performed their\
  \ charming traditional dances. And we, the two roman girls, enjoyed a very special\
  \ backstage-show.\nEveryone was captured, each dance tells a story, each dance has\
  \ its costumes: la Veracruz with those white dresses and the candles; la Danza De\
  \ Los Viejitos, with the funny masks; el Son De La Negra, with its colorful movements.\
  \ And it was surprising how fond of their traditions they were: \u201CColombia tierra\
  \ querida\u201D Colombians sang. It became our song-souvenir.\nMagic\u2019s over.\
  \ 2 am, we had to drive back to Comitini: 200 km. Obviously, we got lost on the\
  \ highway. And guess what? We laughed so much that that night-drive is one of the\
  \ best memories of the trip. \nWe spent just four days in Sicily, but those days\
  \ were so filled with emotions and experiences that they seemed to be many more.\
  \ From the first day, it had been an ongoing effort to prevent a possible disaster.\
  \ And we made it. And we had been rewarded with so many good memories that relate\
  \ us with people that live thousands miles far from us, and a friendship that overcomes\
  \ oceans. Our last night Chris told us, in that mixed-up language we created to\
  \ communicate, \u201Cyou and Chiara had been very caballeros with las mujeres, that\u2019\
  s why we like you so much!\u201D. We took care of each other, notwithstanding the\
  \ huge cultural difference, or maybe because of that very difference. It wasn\u2019\
  t just improbable, it was crazy, and we loved it."
