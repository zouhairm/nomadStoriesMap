Text: "Travel starts even before actual journey begins. \nWe were sent to Assam for\
  \ 17 days, on official duty. My travel enthusiast collogue told me that this is\
  \ our moment to explore Bhutan. Travel becomes more exciting when you travel, when\
  \ you are not supposed to travel.\n\nAfter exploring beautiful woody district of\
  \ Karbi Anglong, I sneaked out of my camp at midnight. Till I reached to Diphu railway\
  \ station my heart was already full with excitement and joy of 'experiencing unknown'.\
  \ Fear of being caught, upbeats the level of excitement.\n\nMy colleague joined\
  \ me on the way, but something unexpected happened as we reached India-Bhutan Border.\
  \ \"You can't enter Bhutan because you are serving as force member, you need NOC\
  \ from Govt\"...The agent said.\n\"Omg what we do now\" ...My colleague said.\n\n\
  I said, travel nomads follow only one rule, 'complete the journey that you have\
  \ started'. So we will enter into Bhutan even if we would have to hide our identity.\
  \ \n\nAnd this is how the hidden travel began.\n\nNow observation was only task.\
  \ We took a taxi from Phuntsholing (called Jaigaon in Indian side). 'Difficult Road\
  \ leads to Most Beautiful destination' this line is true for Bhutan. There is not\
  \ even a hundred mitre straight road. We were climbing up to 7000mtr by making either\
  \ bigger circle or smaller one. Many people feel vomiting so don't forget to have\
  \ lemon juice with you. Bhutanese drivers are so experienced that they drive at\
  \ the speed of 70-80km/h on those very narrow deep dark roads. But this is exciting,\
  \ isn't it?\n\nSeeing lone woman selling fruits alongside the road you can understand\
  \ that woman feel safe in Bhutan. I started thinking about Nirbhaya Rape incident\
  \ of Delhi. Obviously, I was happy and sad, both. But attractive clouds  would not\
  \ let you be anything else than happy.\n\n Phuntsholing to Thimpu was 5 to 6 hrs\
  \ journey for us. Did I tell you we stopped many a times to enjoy waterfalls. Yes\
  \ water falls just over the road.\n\nWe stayed in hotel Bhutan, which costed us\
  \ just 1200rs ($20). So not very costly. Still there hospitality was amazing. \n\
  Whole world is jealous of Bhutan, because they are happy. Now I can see why they\
  \ are happy. They accept who they are. Most of the restaurant, we visited, were\
  \ family run. Father owner, son waiter, mother daughter chefs. \n\nFood in Bhutan\
  \ wasn't as delicious as we have in India, but it might be my tongue's mistake.\
  \ I tried pork for the first time. I always say, \" naya hai to behtar h, chahe\
  \ bura hi kyu na ho\".  Meaning \" new bad food is better than old / regular delicious\"\
  .\n\nBhutan Travelodge is incomplete without visiting Monasteries. Nowadays Giant\
  \ super big Monasteries are coming up. We saw one, which was under construction.\
  \ China was building it, I heard. \n\nBhutanese are fan of painting and tattoos.\
  \ If you want to settle there, go and open a paint shop.\n\nFinally let me talk\
  \ about something really really important. That is PEACE.  Many travelers are peace\
  \ addict. They try to find it wherever they go. In Bhutan you can find peace wherever\
  \ you sit. \n\nThat is what happened to our hidden travel. We were at peace while\
  \ returning. Quite. Observing the sunset, or wind, or waterfalls.\n\nYou must visit\
  \ Bhutan once. It is really a land of wonder among clouds."
