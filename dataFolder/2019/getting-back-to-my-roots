Text: "I am a 46 year old adventurous woman living in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada.\
  \  \n\nI grew up knowing there was some French & possibly Portuguese history in\
  \ my lineage but have only recently connected some of the dots through a dna test/genealogical\
  \ search through ancestry.ca. \n\nOne of my ancestral (maternal) grandfathers from\
  \ Portugal moved to Atlantic Canada in the 1800s to work in an Acadian community\
  \ (I am told it was because he could speak French, having been raised somewhere\
  \ it was spoken) & married an Acadian woman.  Through family stories, I learned\
  \ he is possibly from one of the islands.  I haven't been able to ascertain, however,\
  \ which one or anything more about him other than he was born in 1796 & was married\
  \ in 1839. \n\nI learned that, during the life of my grandmothers in Atlantic Canada,\
  \ assimilation was prevalent.  It was considered 'low class' to speak anything other\
  \ than English. This meant neither the Portuguese or French languages or cultures\
  \ were passed down to me.  I did go on to learn French on my own & now live in an\
  \ area rich in Acadian history.  It feels good to know a bit more about that part\
  \ of my lineage!  \n\nAnd yet something feels incomplete.  I am SO curious about\
  \ the Portuguese ancestry.  I want to know everything...the food, the music, the\
  \ dance, the customs.  I would also like to understand some of the traumas, the\
  \ hardships, the patterns that were perhaps passed down. This is where all healing\
  \ begins. I would love to go on a journey of discovery to understand my family dynamics,\
  \ my personal drives, my passions....\n\nI want to walk where my ancestors walked,\
  \ swim in their waters, experience their dreams.  I want to bring others along with\
  \ me & discover the story. I want to share my connection with it along with the\
  \ emotional journey as all is revealed."
