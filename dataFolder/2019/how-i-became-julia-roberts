Text: "I used my last penny for this trip, as it was supposed to have a special meaning\
  \ for me. One thing I wanted to experience in Bali was a visit to Ketut Liyer, a\
  \ medicine man and palm reader from the memoir & the movie Eat, Pray, Love. I could\
  \ easily identify with the author Elizabeth Gilbert, knowing my drive for writing\
  \ & adventure; everlasting seek for purpose and struggle with relationships. Feeling\
  \ lost in my life, I was curious to see if Ketut could direct me, as he once changed\
  \ Liz`s life by reading her palm. I believe in signs: after my travel buddies randomly\
  \ called Julia, as a reference to Julia Roberts who plays Liz in the movie, visiting\
  \ Ketut was a must. I could`t wait to get to Ubud to meet him \u2013 only to find\
  \ out by a taxi driver that the man died, two years ago. \n\nSaddened and disappointed;\
  \ I realized that my Eat, Pray, Love experience wasn`t going to happen. \n\n\u201E\
  His teachings have been passed onto his son.\u201C \u2013 quickly added the taxi\
  \ driver, seeing my expression in the mirror. I quickly googled this information,\
  \ and my excitement doubled when I found out Liyer house is only 10 minutes walking\
  \ from our villa. This IS destiny.\n\nWithout knowing if Mr. Ketut`s Son was there,\
  \ I began my stroll. Just as I took a turn to the street of Liyer House, I found\
  \ myself eye to eye with a raging stray dog who was ready to attack me. Shaking,\
  \ I managed to run away and asked some girls on scooters to take me past the vicious\
  \ dog. The dog kept running even after us - he was still trying to get me! Was this\
  \ also a sign? I wondered. \n\nI decided to ignore it, already being there: Ketut\
  \ Liyer`s House & Family. \n\nProud of my ability to not give up, and ready to hear\
  \ about my destiny, I entered. There, I saw the man I was looking for. It wasn`t\
  \ Ketut, but his son was there, with a big welcoming smile, waving me to come in.\
  \ I quietly asked for a palm reading, and the importance of this moment was interrupted\
  \ by a woman asking me 20\u20AC for the reading. I paid, was given a sarong to wear,\
  \ and they took me to a little shrine-like area with the smell of incents. First\
  \ thing to notice were photos of Julia Roberts with Ketut.\nMy reader was talking\
  \ a lot; he talked about his father, his family and their fame, while showing photos\
  \ with Julia. My thoughts were wandering in the heat, and I was doubting the whole\
  \ thing already. Then, my reading started.\n\u201EYou are very pretty, very happy,\
  \ very long life.\u201C Wow, I thought, this is great to hear. It was worth coming\
  \ here. \u201EYou will be very happy. Very healthy. Very pretty.\u201C My excitement\
  \ already started dropping. \u201EWhat is your business now?\u201C \u2013\u201E\
  I am unemployed.\u201C \u201EOh, ok. Then you need to open a beauty salon. Very\
  \ succesful.\u201C \u201EMe? I never thought of having a beauty salon.\u201C \u201E\
  Yes, you are very pretty.\u201C\nI couldn`t help to think this was simply a tourist\
  \ attraction, promoted by a Hollywood movie. Liyer house is now a villa with a swimming\
  \ pool, thanks to Ketut`s fame.\nAs a believer in energy & karma, I felt bad about\
  \ having such negative thoughts, sitting  across a spirited man who might be reading\
  \ my mind. I anticipated words that would change my destiny \u2013 but all I heard\
  \ was \u201EPretty. Happy. Long life\u201C. Of course, you wouldn`t hear you are\
  \ a failure, your life is a mess, and there is a disaster coming for you, after\
  \ you came all the way here and paid 20 euros.\n\u201EIt`s all about balance\u201C\
  \ \u2013 he continued. I heard this line before \u2013 it`s the same one Ketut says\
  \ to Julia, a.k.a Liz, in the movie. I withstanded 30 minutes of the endless talk,\
  \ to hear the final prognosis: I was gonna marry and have a boy and a girl. Of course.\
  \ Then I was released.\n\nI thanked him and went to get a pedicure, as a regular\
  \ tourist in Bali. And I still believe in signs \u2013 I think that raging dog WAS\
  \ a sign."
