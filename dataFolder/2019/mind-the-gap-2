Text: "12 months. 9 cities. 1 suitcase. Countless experiences.\n\nLondon. King's Cross.\
  \ The cold, January wind was blowing between my fingers as I stood trying to take\
  \ stock of the events of the recent months. Yes, I had remembered it correctly:\
  \ London was indeed the 8th city since I announced, a year ago nearly to the day\
  \ that I would leave my almost all too comfortable office job. It was a proper job,\
  \ the 9-to-5 type, which I got at the beginning of my career and at the height of\
  \ the crisis. The type of job you could comfortably settle into for years. Needless\
  \ to say, everyone thought I was crazy to give it up. They said I should be happy\
  \ to get a job and be able to hold on to it. They said I was still young, so I should\
  \ appreciate it. Yes, I am still young, so I would still like to travel, I replied\u2026\
  \ even though I had no clue of all the things that would still await me.\n\nA brochure\
  \ flew out of my bag as I reached for my phone, trying to get my bearings in this\
  \ new environment. That small piece of paper brought back a smile to my face. I\
  \ hadn\u2019t realised it was hiding away in there. It was a big first for me: my\
  \ first encounter with the opportunity to volunteer and as such to travel around\
  \ Europe. Before that, I had not even known that such things exist. \n\nThere are\
  \ quite many moments which makes me think about where I am coming from. As a Hungarian,\
  \ currently living in Vienna, sometimes I tend to forget I am actually living abroad.\
  \ Especially during Christmas time, when I can eat \"l\xE1ngos\" and listen to my\
  \ mother tongue language in every corner of the city. One day, I was curious and\
  \ counted how many Hungarians I bumped into on my way from work to home. My lucky\
  \ number was 8. To be honest, I pretty much fun of number eight, because if you\
  \ lie it down, it\u2019s an infinity symbol and my volunteer experience let me discover\
  \ the infinite opportunities and potentials that Europe has. Before I moved to Vienna,\
  \ I have never attached too much importance of my nationality or being a central\
  \ European.  According to an MA23 research (Municipal Department 23 - Economic Affairs,\
  \ Labour, and Statistics) in 2017, 39 percent of Viennese, i.e. 734,709 persons,\
  \ had a foreign background. 534,532 persons or 29 percent of Viennese held a foreign\
  \ nationality. Many of them are obviously from central Europe. I found it amazing.\n\
  \nI am somehow at home in Europe, but still, every place is foreign and I feel that\
  \ they are just waiting for me. I eat pasta in Florence,  walked in the rain to\
  \ the metro in London, had a coffee while I was listening to the sound of Notre\
  \ Dame in Paris. I also tried every kind of tapas while going out for dancing and\
  \ drinking in Madrid, I was listening to an old Polish song in Warsaw, headed to\
  \ a ministry during the German election, and I also tried the \"Brussels bubble\"\
  \ Being at home and still abroad. I love to be European. \n\n\u201CMind the gap\
  \ please\u201D \u2013 the speakers are blaring out the message at the underground\
  \ station. Yes, I do mind the gap, since I\u2019m dragging along a particular suitcase\
  \ into which I have packed up my whole life for half a year. For me, it was worth\
  \ pack it all up like this. In all certainty, I have experienced fewer limitations,\
  \ whether linguistic, cultural, social or professional, since I started out on this\
  \ journey. \u201CMaybe I have fewer gaps now, thanks to this experience,\u201D I\
  \ thought, and I continued to pull behind me my half a year, all packed up in that\
  \ single suitcase.\n\n(Some sentences are from a story that was already on IVY's\
  \ blog while I was living in Vienna. From that travelling experience, I published\
  \ that article and 2 others for a blog contest. In the future, I would like to start\
  \ my business based mainly on travel writing. Many trips are already planned, but\
  \ I need some help with business and writing)"
