Text: "When I turned 18 I already had a lot of plans about traveling, taking my backpack\
  \ as my best friend and just living the american teenage dream. Everything was perfectly\
  \ planned, no problems. USA was waiting for me, I could see Uncle Sam with his pointed\
  \ finger, looking at me, with his well-fitted top hat and cool white beard, saying\
  \ \"I WANT YOU.\"\nIn the airport, waiting for my flight and holding my tickets\
  \ in my hands, I kept staring at the bold letters above the airline's name. HEL\
  \ - Helsinki-Vantaa International Airport. How long it takes to a human body freeze\
  \ to death? I mean, I'm brazilian. My winter is warmer than their summer. I saw\
  \ on Google. \nI also saw that Finnish language has the word \"kalsarik\xE4nnit\"\
  , that means literally get drunk alone at home only in underwear. Okay, I can live\
  \ there.\nIt was a twenty four hours trip until the arrival in my new \"home for\
  \ one year.\" Looking through the airport big windows, it looked beautiful. The\
  \ sun was a little ashamed, but was there, and I could see green trees... I was\
  \ feeling so calm, even in the middle of a big airport hearing people talking a\
  \ lot in a confusing language. \nThen was the moment of getting real about the situation.\
  \ I was there. My american dream that had a little -big- change was happening. I\
  \ was there, alone, me, myself, my fears, my dreams and three baggages. Out there\
  \ was my new home, my future friends, the places that I was about to visit. Everything\
  \ was out there, just walking through that automatic door. \nMy first step outside\
  \ was cold. The cold wind passed through my body, automatically, my arms wrapped\
  \ around me. It was spring. \nThen was the moment of getting afraid about the situation.\
  \ I was there. It was spring, but I was freezing. I didn't know anybody there. Finnish\
  \ is a hard language. Would my English be enough? I never had to use English in\
  \ my daily life. Should I just step back? \nDeep breath. I didn't have money to\
  \ go back, anyway. Some people called me crazy, others called me brave. I was there,\
  \ and I would stay there. Also, everybody there knew the meaning of \"kalsarik\xE4\
  nnit.\"\nI was expecting good things for my year, but I didn't know that my expectations\
  \ were low compared to everything I lived that year. I cried of fear a few times,\
  \ but of happiness a lot more. It was where I met the sensation of feeling cold,\
  \ but warmly happy about it. I met the cold that warms me. \nThat year was the door\
  \ to new unknowns to explore. New countries, new horizons, new feelings. It was\
  \ a self-discovering journey, and continues. I'm not a locked person anymore. I\
  \ don't have walls, I only have horizons."
