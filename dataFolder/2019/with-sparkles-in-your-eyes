Text: "\"I'll be there telling everyone 'That's my granddaughter.'\" It's what Grandma\
  \ always said when I told her my dreams, whether they were the goal of six-year-old\
  \ me to be the first female professional baseball player or when I told her I would\
  \ be walking down the red carpet one day. All she made me promise was to tell her\
  \ all about it.\n\nShe always told me that everyone had a story to tell and you\
  \ just had to be brave enough to dig for it. She told me the best stories were the\
  \ ones that could only be told with stars shining in your eyes.\n\nWhen I stepped\
  \ onto the train to take me to JFK before my flight to Finland, it was exactly a\
  \ year after she had passed away. I didn't realize it until I looked at the calendar\
  \ on my phone and saw the date. Amazingly, I was hearing her voice telling me that\
  \ she was proud of me, that I was living the dream I had always had to see places\
  \ no one else I knew had seen.\n\nHer last piece of advice to me was to never have\
  \ any regrets. She didn't regret that there were place she hadn't seen or things\
  \ she hadn't done because she was happy with what she had done and accomplished.\
  \ SHe'd kept a large family together no matter how far across the globe we ventured.\
  \ She always knew exactly what to cook for dinner. She lived to see her great-grandchildren\
  \ grow up.\n\nEstonia was not on many people's radar, many still wondering if they\
  \ were part of Russia when I said that was my final destination. I was constantly\
  \ asked why I wanted to go there, didn't I want to see the Parthenon or the Spanish\
  \ Steps instead? What if this was my only chance, why waste it on somewhere without\
  \ anything to see?\n\nMy grandma would be proud of me for ignoring those people\
  \ and making my own memories of getting hopelessly lost in Helsinki while desperately\
  \ looking for somewhere to eat; rolling naked in the snow between sessions in the\
  \ sauna; climbing to the top of Kiek in der K\xF6k and seeing the fairy tale scene\
  \ before me that was Tallinn; and exploring an abandoned prison on the Baltic. I\
  \ didn't want normal, I wanted to see everything that had a story to tell that no\
  \ one had been able to tell me yet and to make my own fairy tales. She called me\
  \ a romantic long before I learned what it meant: that I had a sense of adventure\
  \ wider than my little state of Connecticut could hold and my eyes would only sparkle\
  \ in wonder when I saw more, more, more. \n\nShe wasn't there to see it. She won't\
  \ be telling anyone how we are connected if any of my dreams comes to life. But\
  \ I saw an otherworldly beauty in Tallinn you can't find in many other places now.\
  \ There were castles and prisons, artwork and graffiti, grey Soviet buildings and\
  \ explosions of color. I brought the memories back with me and know that my eyes\
  \ continue to sparkle like my grandmother had always said they should."
