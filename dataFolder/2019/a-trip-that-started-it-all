Text: "It is a rare chance to have a trip that turns your understanding of the world\
  \ upside down. Usually, it is the first trip one takes in their life, or perhaps\
  \ a long-term experience abroad and it was the combination of the two for me. I\
  \ was born in a post-communist country and we all know the same old story of closed\
  \ borders and limited freedom to move. One would think that the 21st century would\
  \ not be the same, but essentially at the beginning, it was. Building friendly relations\
  \ with other states is not an easy task for a new country, going and exploring required\
  \ visa and financial well-being. The first big trip I took, was long, solo and full\
  \ of new and unexplored. I was lucky enough to have a chance to study abroad with\
  \ a scholarship and the country I went to was the United Kingdom. \n\nIt had always\
  \ been my mother's dream to go there. For her, it was a diverse country, full of\
  \ stories about Sherlock Holmes and the sound of Beatles, the birthplace of both\
  \ Mr Darcy and Mr Bean. Since I was young, she would tell me how life on the other\
  \ side of the continent seemed so interesting and full of excitement. We would watch\
  \ old classical British movies and series and admire their elegance and their sense\
  \ of humour. Imagine her excitement when her daughter received an opportunity to\
  \ go there, it was a trip that would make not only my life but hers more interesting\
  \ as well.\n\nSurprisingly while packing, what I was feeling was not the excitement\
  \ but nervousness. A leap into unknown does sound exciting but what if you encounter\
  \ the negative that changes your attitude. However, my experience did indeed turn\
  \ out to be an amazing one, the country was beautiful, people were friendly, and\
  \ different small trips I had were all unforgettable. \n\nBut, how did it turn my\
  \ world upside down? Simply because I became a better version of myself. I became\
  \ someone who understood the value of good and did not let the bad get to her. Every\
  \ place is full of good and bad, the latter one does not define the first. I learnt\
  \ to value small things, I started appreciating my beautiful country, even more,\
  \ I met people who changed my perceptions and outlooks, and lastly, I learnt how\
  \ to travel. Perhaps it does not make sense, how can one learn how to travel, it\
  \ is so easy, with few clicks you can book an amazing vacation. But it is not as\
  \ easy when as a child despite vivid imagination the world seems to be limited to\
  \ your house and city, or your small country; you do not realize the grandness of\
  \ the world around. I made sure to share my experiences with my mother, even if\
  \ it was via the internet in my heart she was there with me, and her world was gradually\
  \ changing also. \n\nThe unknown and new I experienced boosted my desire to know\
  \ more and see new, challenging, far from the comfort zone. My first solo trip made\
  \ me fall in love with the travel."
