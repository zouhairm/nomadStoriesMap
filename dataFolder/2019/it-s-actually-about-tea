Text: "When I first flew to Belarus, I had no idea what to expect. Well. That\u2019\
  s not true. I had some ideas, given the friends who had told me stuff they had experienced\
  \ here, in that same context. The school. The nine-months long intensive acting\
  \ school they had attended and I was going to go to myself.\n\nThey didn\u2019t\
  \ tell me much about the country itself though \u2013 or the culture. Everything\
  \ was about the school and now that I am here myself, I get why. I don\u2019t think\
  \ they had time to go out in the world, I know I don\u2019t. So I started to steal\
  \ it because if not I\u2019d probably die.\n\nThey mostly told me about each other,\
  \ about their connection. \u201CThese strangers you\u2019re afraid of meeting now,\
  \ they said, talking about my soon-to-be French classmates, there is no way you\
  \ keep see them as strangers after a month.\u201D Well. It\u2019s been five, and\
  \ they are now as strange to me as can be. The harder I tried to reach out, the\
  \ further they went, to the point that I thought \u2013 it\u2019s just not for me.\
  \ Why in the name of sanity would I put myself in such a situation?\n\nBy that time\
  \ I did learn a thing or two about connection, though, from the tea bunkers I\u2019\
  ve been discovering under the ground of this city. You would never guess they\u2019\
  re here. You\u2019ve walked for over an hour under the snow in this almost all-soviet-styled\
  \ city, and then you push a door and take a stairway that leads to a corridor \u2013\
  \ and there you are. Tea houses. They\u2019re the safe spaces you\u2019ve been longing,\
  \ and they\u2019re the common ground from where you\u2019ll be able to heal and\
  \ grow out.\n\nConnection doesn\u2019t lie in all the What\u2019s your names and\
  \ the Where are you froms. It\u2019s not about over-communication or spending all\
  \ your time in the same rooms without seeing each other, or even sharing a same\
  \ language. Most times, connection doesn\u2019t even require words.\n\nIt\u2019\
  s the little things. It\u2019s that person brewing tea, gong fu cha-style, in the\
  \ middle of the streets for strangers and trusting you with the teapot while he\
  \ walk away for a bit. It\u2019s the ones who won\u2019t let you circle back to\
  \ your favourite oolong because they understand who you are and why you\u2019re\
  \ here, it\u2019s the moment when you\u2019re just sat but they\u2019ve been watching\
  \ you and they decide that you\u2019re ready and it\u2019s time, and they bring\
  \ the special teas out and share them with you. It\u2019s the French lyrics that\
  \ pop under the roof because you\u2019re from France and basically the only person\
  \ here. It\u2019s that one who noticed that you liked that little flat pig ceramic\
  \ so much that you came back for it \u2013 and now he won\u2019t pick another one\
  \ for you, whenever you come, and it\u2019s the smile you exchange when it\u2019\
  s your turn to notice.\n\n\u201CI see you.\u201D\n\nIt\u2019s actually funny, how\
  \ easy it is for some people to make you feel like you belong, without actually\
  \ using any words, without saying anything \u2013 because they can\u2019t. Because\
  \ you don\u2019t share a language with each other.\n\nBut it makes sense.\n\nIt\
  \ makes sense because connection was never a matter of communication. It\u2019s\
  \ not the words or the big conversations or the hugging, it\u2019s not even the\
  \ kissing and the sex. Connection can happen in the middle of all these things,\
  \ but it\u2019s not what it is. Connection is about seeing someone and noticing\
  \ that, at that same moment, they are actually seeing you too.\n\nWherever I went,\
  \ tea was always a life-saviour \u2013 would I share it with people or have it shared\
  \ by them. Because when it\u2019s not wild nature, when it\u2019s cities and humans\
  \ and buildings, you have to reach out to someone. Otherwise you\u2019re just consuming\
  \ the hell out of the place you\u2019re traveling to.\n\nTea is my common ground.\
  \ It\u2019s the way I can connect with someone. It\u2019s how I travel, and from\
  \ where I can find my feet."
