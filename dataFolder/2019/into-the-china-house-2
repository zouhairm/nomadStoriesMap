Text: "The scorching April sun can\u2019t bother us from perpetually strolling around\
  \ iconic street art in Penang, photo-hopping from one mural to another. Like the\
  \ rest of Southeast Asia, summer happen almost all year in this part of the world.\
  \ But despite the weather, there are many others who have similar objective to collect\
  \ as much photos along the historical walk course, or a man-pedaled-trishaw ride\
  \ as some prefer. \n\nWe were just finished our mid-term exam at that time, me and\
  \ my fellow exchange-student friends, and running away to the neighbor city cannot\
  \ be more of a thrilling getaway. I barely know them few weeks ago, let alone speak\
  \ their respective mother language despite having similar Asian root, but there\
  \ I sat sharing my chicken curry rice for lunch and took a group photo afterward\
  \ in between steel rod sculptures and colorful illustrations along some big, some\
  \ small, some pedestrian-friendly, and some not avenues.\n\nIn action to commemorate\
  \ award given by UNESCO as World Heritage Site, the local government commissioned\
  \ some selected artists through idea competition for \u201CMarking George Town\u201D\
  , said guide maps retrieved from our hotel receptionist. Sculpture at Work won the\
  \ pitch in 2009 and had the honor to adorn Penang with their signature street art\
  \ illustrating decades old stories and traditions in a casual, almost cheeky way.\
  \ Based on our discussion, the fact that they featured a semi-naked cartoon of fat\
  \ rich guy hanging from his mistress\u2019s window did not align with reason why\
  \ they are chosen as the winner.\n\nWe took an indoor break by visiting Pinang Peranakan\
  \ Mansion located nearby, in which bring me to understand the truth behind the \u2018\
  heritage\u2019 title Penang owned. The museum filled with hundreds of antiques enriching\
  \ every inch of the ornate tiles covering the rooms. Our guide\u2019s explanations\
  \ bring me picturing myself taken back to decades before and living as one of the\
  \ Peranakans (Chinese Straits) in such grand palace having all I wanted fulfilled,\
  \ and yet feeling unhappy of traditions and cannot leave the house due to uncompromised\
  \ responsibilities, or maybe an arranged marriage. Not to mention the amount of\
  \ pressure to maintain body goal according to that time which require women to have\
  \ small proportion of everything, from arm-length to shoe size. I cannot help but\
  \ feel grateful to have a weekend to spare for such occasion of visiting an old\
  \ heritage mansion and enjoying the view of some remarkable sights with pleasant\
  \ companies. \n\nIt is by the end of the mansion we met Carmen, a local Penang acquaintance\
  \ of my Burmese friend, who gracefully sharing with us her favorite coffee shop.\
  \ I have no information prior to visiting this caf\xE9, so actually, no expectation.\
  \ As we enter the usual glass-door, we were faced by quite big crowd sat in several\
  \ wooden tables and chairs, Chinese paintings and furniture fill the entire room,\
  \ and dozens of cake stands with dome lid fill a long table on the left showcasing\
  \ appetizing cakes in many warm colors. \n\nIt all went weird when Carmen took us\
  \ to what I thought was the pantry behind the long table, but then I realized it\
  \ was a long hallway leading us into another entirely new room consist of more tables\
  \ and chairs! There is even an outdoor section in between the rooms where we found\
  \ some art illustration on the walls along with small pond, and guess what, more\
  \ tables filled with guests. After a tour of the caf\xE9 (they also had paintings\
  \ exhibition upstairs), we were going back to order our cakes from the stall in\
  \ the first room. We were having tiramisu and chocolate cheesecake, and the presentation\
  \ was not lying, it was one of the best tiramisu I ever had, layers of moist cake\
  \ and light coffee cream were perfectly completing each other. \n\nAfter a short\
  \ while, we finally part with Carmen to catch our bus, it was a very worth weekend,\
  \ and now we are six hours away from Terminal Berpadu Selatan in Kuala Lumpur and\
  \ few more hours away from my first class the next morning."
