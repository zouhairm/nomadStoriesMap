Text: "I strode adventurously, into the mid-morning greenery that had seeped from\
  \ the rainforest. The dark green swaying leaves splayed like hanging swings, in\
  \ the grove of towering trees. The far-off water sounds of one of the \u2018wonders\
  \ of the world\u2019, Victoria Falls, gave tingling sensations of happiness to my\
  \ mind, body and soul.\n\nAmbling ahead, anticipating clapping my eyes on the mighty\
  \ falls, seemed like a never-ending three-hour trek! Now over a period of time,\
  \ from mild to heavier sounds, the outlying water was distantly gushing, whoosh\
  \ - whoosh! \n\nMy steps quickened, and my pace hastened. Along the way, the hidden\
  \ birds chirped, and the shy crimson-red flame lily flowers peeped from emerald\
  \ green bushes, adjoining mingled fragrances of wet earth and flora. I thought,\
  \ \u201CWhat a lovely trek, but when will I reach the waterfalls!?\u201D\n\nScurrying\
  \ ahead, I heard the waterfall sounds, closing in. The stronger thundering water-roar\
  \ was beckoning. I heard it flowing against heavy rocks and splashing vigorously\
  \ in the watercourse! Yet, I was still waiting to cast my eyes, on the waterfalls\
  \ discovered by the famous explorer, David Livingston in 1855.\n\nI convinced myself,\
  \ \u201CA few more steps\u201D. Finally! My eyebrows arched and I gleefully smiled,\
  \ \u201CVictoria Falls!\u201D It was exquisite like a canvas painting. The shimmering\
  \ extreme width of the falls was at 5,604 feet, and the water-force fell at 354\
  \ feet from a sheer soaring height. \n\nThe gushing water shattered against the\
  \ rocky Zambezi River, giving rise to thunderous splash-spritz showers of Victoria\
  \ Falls! My fingers ran through my ebony-black long wet hair. It felt like heavenly\
  \ bliss. Tasting the sweet water had enticed my soft supple pink lips. It surely\
  \ was the most divine feeling. \n\nExperiencing this magic, I looked high above\
  \ the water-spritz. A robe of sparkling golden and claret-red sunrays, captivated\
  \ a vibrant rainbow prism band of colour, amidst the Victoria Falls. I then glared\
  \ down; in the river\u2019s milky-water-slivers, was a team of white-water rafters,\
  \ rushing brilliantly along the rolling river, on the narrow dangerous gorge. The\
  \ adventurous rafters and shallow water, was enveloped with thunderous rising smoke,\
  \ like a souffl\xE9 of white mist.\n\nLeaving the amazing spot, I excitedly headed\
  \ to my planned adventure near the Zimbabwe and Zambia Border Bridge. It would be\
  \ a life-challenge for a \u2018bungee\u2019 adrenaline-rush drop. \n\nAt the border,\
  \ an expert cautiously tied elastic-harness-ropes around my legs, thighs, and waist.\
  \ Within a few moments, the trainer, other jumpers and me formed a semi-circle.\
  \ \n\nThe instructor said, \u201CDon\u2019t look down when jumping. Keep your eyes\
  \ ahead. I will push you on the count of three!\u201D My throat ran dry.\n\nI was\
  \ the only young amateur jumper, among the other jumpers. Each jumper began plummeting\
  \ like a pro! Now, it was my turn to spring off the ledge! My emotions took over\
  \ my brain! My heart was thumping! I walked nervously, yet cautiously to the bridge\u2019\
  s point. The expert loudly said, \u201COne\u2026\u2026Two\u2026\u2026Three!\u201D\
  \ \n\nI screamed with a thousand distressed emotions! It was my first head-dive\
  \ in mid-air! I had a choice of flight or fight! The latter was wiser.\n\nI shut\
  \ my eyes and took a deep breath. The nervousness, the terrifying anxiety, and the\
  \ fear, all vanished! I hollered, \u201CI am as free as a bird!\u201D \n\nReaching\
  \ the great valley of water, my body bounced at 111 metres in the waft of air. The\
  \ cool water showers sprayed against my smooth face, igniting my five senses with\
  \ extraordinary energy! \n\nI believe, the magnificent Victoria Falls will always\
  \ be a traveller\u2019s adventure. Its daredevil activities will gift pearls of\
  \ wisdom, of an open-mind and a brave-heart! \n\nI wrote a poem on the wonderful\
  \ waterfalls as, Mother Nature\u2019s Victoria Falls:\n\nA leap into the unknown,\n\
  with a souffl\xE9 of white mist,\nis Mother Nature\u2019s adventure. \n\nThe gushing-spritzing\
  \ water,\nThe soaring-splashing water,\nis Mother Nature\u2019s brilliance,\n\n\
  The river\u2019s deepest core,\nwith a thunderous roar, \nis Mother Nature\u2019\
  s Victoria Falls!\n\n- By Sunita Bansdawala"
