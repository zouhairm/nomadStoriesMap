Text: "The dreadful but exciting planning of exploring an unfamiliar place is often\
  \ one of the many reasons travelling is captivating. \n\nWhen I travelled alone\
  \ to Cebu, I wrote all the must-see places I saw on travel blogs and guides. It\
  \ was a real hard work as I have to organize everything by myself. I have to maximize\
  \ the time I have so I can visit all these places. I created a schedule that I should\
  \ strictly follow. For all we know, planning helps us to become more organized and\
  \ it saves time. \n\nI used to set a time limit to everything. I had boundaries,\
  \ limitations, and restrictions. In other words, there was a timeline for all that\
  \ I have to do. I established a goal that at the age of 20, I should have already\
  \ obtained a degree (which actually happened). However, it didn\u2019t stop there\
  \ as I continuously set a time limit for my dreams again. I dreamed that at 25,\
  \ I already have a stable career and I am providing my parents with all the wealth\
  \ and luxuries they deserve to have. At 28, I am married with the man of my dreams\
  \ with three cute little kids. At 30, I am a full-time housewife, taking care of\
  \ this happy family.\n\nAt that time, I thought that this timetable setting was\
  \ necessary because it keeps me motivated. It was very easy to put it that way.\
  \ It was so easy to draw this picture without knowing that a lot of things can happen\
  \ in between \u2013 that everything that has been planned and arranged can be altered.\
  \ Now, looking back at my previous trips, everything didn\u2019t actually turn out\
  \ to be as planned. The itineraries I created were not followed. Some places were\
  \ missed. Some places which were not on the list were explored. Some problems occurred\
  \ such as delays and detours. Now that I see it, every time I go on trips, these\
  \ always happen. The journey doesn\u2019t go exactly as planned. Likewise, I realized\
  \ that there\u2019s no way I will become a millionaire at the age of 25 (I am already\
  \ 26 now!!!). Likewise, I know to myself that I am not yet ready to get married\
  \ and settle down at the age of 28. \n\nMy plans were already ruined but it\u2019\
  s totally fine. My plans were actually BEAUTIFULLY ruined because I turned out to\
  \ be the person I didn\u2019t expect to but supposed to become. I realized that\
  \ life is not as smooth and as simple as a + b = c, we will encounter other complicated\
  \ equations in between. Life is like unplanned trips and itineraries, a lot of unexpected\
  \ things may come along the way. We may have to travel the unusual route. We may\
  \ take turns. Or we may stay in one place longer than the other. We will realize\
  \ that all the places we have been to have their own significance in molding us\
  \ as a person. \n\nIt is okay to set goals that we want to pursue. It is, in fact,\
  \ good because it serves as our motivation and drive to become better. It is not\
  \ wrong to be optimistic but it is also practical to be realistic. So, it is okay\
  \ not to achieve those goals at this certain time especially if circumstances don\u2019\
  t permit it. If the plan didn\u2019t work out, remember that there\u2019s always\
  \ a plan B or there might not be any certain plans but still, choose to get moving\
  \ to see what is out there. \n\nWell, I still have time to achieve those dreams\
  \ but I will no longer put a big pressure to myself. Whatever I will be in the process,\
  \ I will appreciate it. And there\u2019s no way I can enjoy myself other than living\
  \ the moment \u2013 living my life now. From today, I decided to stop putting a\
  \ time limit and boundaries to my future. I already obtained a deeper understanding\
  \ that there are endless possibilities of what I can become. Whatever things are\
  \ waiting to happen, I am ready to embrace them and I am ready to see new perspective\
  \ from them. All of them."
