Text: "Kim Hyun-Jun started laughing the moment he stepped into my apartment and the\
  \ further in he ventured the louder he laughed. \n\nHe didn\u2019t have far to go.\
  \  My apartment was a typical Korean \u2018one room\u2019 - a small square bedroom\
  \ with attached bath - and the luxury, in my case, of a sliding door to cordon off\
  \ the kitchen. It was in the kitchen that his laughter cranked up a notch and he\
  \ finally turned to my co-teacher, and school appointed \u2018handler\u2019, Min-Jung,\
  \ to make a comment in Korean that had her dropping her face into her hands for\
  \ a moment and then peering up at me through her fingers.\n\n\u201CHe hasn\u2019\
  t seen so many cockroaches outside of a (condemned) Chinese restaurant.\u201D She\
  \ translated. I was horrified and relieved and\u2014as Hyun-Jun and Min-Jung began\
  \ to discuss the extent of the infestation\u2014careful not to touch anything. \n\
  \nThere had been warning signs which I had tried my best to ignore\u2014the dozen\
  \ dried out roach carcasses clustered in the groove for the sliding door separating\
  \ the main room from the kitchen that I had noticed on my first day. \n\n\u201C\
  They\u2019re all dead so it\u2019s fine\u201D, I told myself. \n\nThen there had\
  \ been the five watermelon seed sized ones that had fled in all directions when\
  \ I moved the shoe cabinet on my second day. \n\n\"At least they're small\", I thought,\
  \ turning my face firmly to look at the bright side of things. \n\nI had hesitantly\
  \ asked Min-Jung the following morning if it was normal for Korean apartments to\
  \ have bugs. \n\n\u201CYes,\u201D she had said, \u201Cevery apartment has some bugs\u201D\
  . \n\nThat night I felt with horror, the crunch of an exoskeleton breaking beneath\
  \ my bare foot as I returned to bed from a trip to the bathroom in the dark. Whatever\
  \ I had stepped on hadn't felt so small and the next day my line of questioning\
  \ evolved into asking \"how many\" bugs were normal for Korean households.\n\n\u201C\
  How many bugs do you have?\u201D She asked me.\n\n\u201CTen to fifteen,\u201D I\
  \ answered.\n\n\u201CHow about after school today I go and visit your apartment.\
  \ Is it okay?\u201D She asked.\n\nI wholeheartedly agreed and found myself getting\
  \ a ride home with Min-Jung as she spoke to me about their former Native English\
  \ teacher, Narina, who had been Australian, a ballerina and very neat. The reason\
  \ we were both headed to my apartment that moment gave me doubts about that last\
  \ point but I nodded amicably and hurried upstairs to unlock my apartment while\
  \ Min-Jung parked the car.\n\nIt was the second week of March and nearing six o'clock\
  \ so my apartment was dark when I opened the door but the dim light spilling in\
  \ from the hallway allowed my eyes to catch movement on the floor within. When I\
  \ switched the light on inside, I sent a dozen thumb sized roaches into a frenzy\u2014\
  all rushing for the nearest cover while I, still wearing shoes, began to stomp at\
  \ them wildly.\n\nThis is how Min-Jung found me, yelling in an effort to drown out\
  \ any audible crunching noises and surrounded by eight or nine dead bugs while a\
  \ handful of living ones zoomed around the room, further energized by the arrival\
  \ of another person.\n\n\u201CPack some clothes,\u201D she said, making a phone\
  \ call, \u201Cyou will stay with me tonight.\u201D \n\nThat is what brought Hyun-Jun,\
  \ the school\u2019s exterminator, to my apartment Friday night. He had been asked\
  \ to survey the situation and provide Min-Jung with an estimate for resolving my\
  \ bug problem but when he removed the baseboard from the cabinets in my kitchen\
  \ sending a wave of red-brown roaches of all sizes in every direction and confirmed\
  \ that there were at least two roach nests behind my cabinets he agreed to spray\
  \ my apartment at no cost. It would take a total of three visits and he insisted\
  \ on starting immediately. \n\n\"Get your things,\" said Min-Jung, \"you will live\
  \ with me for now.\"\n\nWhen I made the decision to live in Korea I certainly never\
  \ expected to find myself living in a cockroach infested apartment but more than\
  \ that I hadn't expected to find so many people willing to go above and beyond to\
  \ ensure I enjoyed my stay."
