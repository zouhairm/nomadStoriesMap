Text: "Traveling alwyas has its own pros and cons. How you turn the cons into pros\
  \ as well is one of the tasks a traveler enjoys to do. I have a similar story when\
  \ I travelled to Guadalajara, Mexico for one of International Internships in Social\
  \ Media Marketing. \n     I was afraid and excited at the same time. Excited because\
  \ I could finally travel after my long hectic semester, and afraid because I didn\u2019\
  t know Spanish.\n     Many thoughts came in my mind. Starting from how will I manage\
  \ to communicate to how will I manage to eat red meat because I hardly eat non vegetarian\
  \ food. However, I realised that traveling to such a country where there\u2019s\
  \ a huge cultural barrier, language barrier can be exciting too.\n     With all\
  \ the fears and excitement, I travelled to Mexico for two months. As soon as I landed,\
  \ I faced many challenges starting from getting a cab to having done my groceries.\
  \ Language barrier was one of the major problems that I faced. \n    Fortunately,\
  \ my internship coworkers were pretty fluent in speaking English. Some helped me\
  \ with groceries and some helped me with connecting to other different people. By\
  \ the end of three weeks, I was happy to know people from more than 12 countries.\n\
  \    As time passed by, our bond got stronger. Along with our work, we managed to\
  \ explore Guadalajara and get along with each other. This trip soon converted from\
  \ a normal to the most excited trip ever.\n    I realised by the end of my trip\
  \ that, even though I was curious and had second thoughts to travel to Mexico, I\
  \ managed to do everything on my own. I made friends, I ate non vegetarian food\
  \ and most importantly, I adapted their culture. \n    It was my time to say a goodbye\
  \ to Mexico and I could see tears in the eyes of all those friends I made there.\
  \ People from 12 different cried as I departed and it was one of the saddest moments\
  \ in my life. I realised how short this life is to do such things and travel around.\n\
  \    As soon as I came back to Victoria, Canada, I decided to travel again by doing\
  \ a Summer Internship in Cairo, Egypt. This gave me realisation that yes, I now\
  \ consider myself a Traveller and this is where my life belongs."
