Text: "I\u2019ve been reminiscing a lot about the time I spent in Egypt earlier this\
  \ year. A time I spent reconnecting with my family, my history and most importantly\
  \ \u2013 with myself. A time I spent understanding culture the only way one can\
  \ \u2013 through the profound intricacies of everyday life. It was a very formative\
  \ time, so I figured I should share some of my most intense experiences. One such\
  \ experience was meeting King Ali \u2013 an absolute boss-man of a street-artist\
  \ who works at the Blue Hole, in Dahab; a tourist attraction famous for its gorgeous\
  \ snorkelling spots. For the Egyptian equivalent of 1 Australian dollar, Ali creates\
  \ personalised \u2018sand-paintings.\u2019 He does so by expertly arranging multi-coloured\
  \ sand into small glass vases. He works away effortlessly with small metal tools\
  \ at a weathered old desk \u2013 making magic out of nothing. I spoke to Ali in\
  \ broken Arabic whilst he made my magic. I asked him if it was difficult, learning\
  \ his craft... He responded sharply with: \u201CNo, nothing in life is difficult.\u201D\
  \ He told me of his extensive travels across Europe, concluding that he loved Egypt\
  \ the most \u2013 the place where people knew how to work hard and do little. He\
  \ paused to talk business with a red-shirted friend... Requesting that his 12 newly\
  \ arrived cousins be treated like royalty, for little cost. Facing me again, he\
  \ mumbled something about \u2018w\u0101jib\u2019 (\u0648\u0627\u062C\u0628): the\
  \ Arab notion that one has a duty to serve one\u2019s guests, and to do so well.\
  \ Ali told me he\u2019d been making money out of sand for 13 years, but that his\
  \ heart belonged to painting. His eyes lit up with stardust, as he told me he\u2019\
  d been painting for 34 years! When I told him I was a poet, he asked me what I wrote\u2026\
  \ Rattling off 6 forms of classical Arabic poetry. I confessed I wrote in English\
  \ but was learning to write in Arabic. This pleased him. He recommended 2 rare anthologies\
  \ that he said I\u2019d only find in a tiny bookshop in Cairo; I promised myself\
  \ I\u2019d track them down. He also encouraged me to dive into the 7th century love\
  \ poet Jamil ibn Ma\u2019mar, Jahili poetry and poetry from the Abbasid Caliphate\
  \ (1261 - 1517 AD). He told me his favourite poet was Aboul-Qacem Echebbi \u2013\
  \  a Tunisian poet who died mysteriously, aged 25. I couldn\u2019t help but think\
  \ of Tupac Shakur \u2013 a different king, a different time, a different place \u2013\
  \ both taken too young. Ali later told me he\u2019d read 1650 books in his lifetime...\
  \ I looked into his eyes and didn\u2019t doubt it for a second. I saw beauty, timeless\
  \ and forgotten \u2013 childish curiosity, literary eternity... I didn\u2019t tell\
  \ Ali he was wildly over-qualified for a street-vendor, because Ali was happy. Nor\
  \ did I tell him that I wasn\u2019t yet able to read Pre-Islamic poetry in Arabic\
  \ so archaic, that most Arabs still struggle with it. I just recorded our conversation,\
  \ paid him double, wished him peace and trusted my destiny. This entire encounter\
  \ occurred in 7 minutes, whilst Ali simultaneously made magic out of sand, and smoked\
  \ a hands-free cigarette\u2026 \u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728\n\n\n*This story is\
  \ intended to be accompanied by 3 extremely colorful images: of King Ali, my personal\
  \ sand sculpture, and the Sinai Sunset."
