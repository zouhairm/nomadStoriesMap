Text: "Last March, I traveled to Morocco and during the week that I spent there, I\
  \ chose to hire a local tour guide to take me to Ait Ben Haddou. \n\nIn the middle\
  \ of the car journey, I asked my tour guide, \"The itinerary says that lunch is\
  \ provided at a touristic restaurant in Ait Ben Haddou, but I'd much rather try\
  \ your local food than eat pizzas and burgers. Would that be at all possible?\"\n\
  \n\"You would like to experience our culture?\" he queried, looking a little surprised.\n\
  \n\"More than anything.\" I said.\n\nHe smiled and told me simply, \"I know a place.\"\
  \n\nAfter about an hour of driving through the Moroccan countryside, we reached\
  \ a small house made of mud and stone that seemed to blend into the arid landscape.\
  \ A small man named Ahmed emerged from the building dressed from head to toe in\
  \ a cloth made of the most vibrant shade of blue and gave us a toothy grin. After\
  \ welcoming us with open arms, he asked me, \"Do you like to paint?\"\n\nI was a\
  \ little confused by the question, but I nodded and said, \"Yes, I love to paint.\"\
  \n\n\"Then you must see my work!\" he exclaimed in excitement. Ahmed led us to his\
  \ barn and pulled open the heavy doors. I then peered inside and gasped loudly at\
  \ what I saw. The entire room was filled with stunning water-color paintings. \n\
  \n\"You're so talented!\" I praised.\n\n\"Thank you, although my wife would disagree!\"\
  \ he joked. He then proceeded to tell me that if I ever returned to Morocco he would\
  \ be glad to give me a lesson. \n\nSmiling from ear to ear, I nodded gratefully.\
  \ \"I would love that.\" I said.\n\nAfterwards, he led us into his home. Once I\
  \ stepped through the doorway and looked inside, I was awestruck. The walls were\
  \ covered in drapes of every color imaginable, whilst the floor was decorated in\
  \ hand-woven rugs. I'd never seen such an embellished home. \n\nSmiling, he offered\
  \ us each a cushion to sit down on whilst he prepared us some warm mint tea.\n\n\
  Whilst we drank, we shared stories about our lives and compared each other's cultures.\
  \ It was a truly eye-opening experience.\n\nI was then lucky enough to discover\
  \ that Ahmed had been preparing a large meal prior to our visit and that there would\
  \ be enough to spare. Once it was ready, he served us some succulent lamb and prune\
  \ tagine with sides of flatbread and couscous. It was one of the best meals I had\
  \ ever eaten.\n\nAfter the meal, he offered us homemade almond biscuits and some\
  \ more mint tea. I'd never eaten so much in my life, but the food was so delicious\
  \ that I could have eaten for hours! Unfortunately, the sun began to set and it\
  \ was time to leave. \n\nAlthough we had only just met, I really felt like I had\
  \ made a friend for life with Ahmed, and I hope to that one day I'll have the opportunity\
  \ to see him again. I am so glad that I strayed off the well-trodden path, and decided\
  \ to take part in an adventure because that day really was the highlight of my trip.\
  \ To be able to experience Morocco as the locals do, and to be able to spend the\
  \ day chatting with such a generous and kind man, really was a privilege. I hope\
  \ more than anything that others will be open to these experiences too as I cannot\
  \ recommend it enough."
