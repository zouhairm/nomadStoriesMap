Text: "I hopped onto a plane full of excitement as I finally got to visit Ireland.\
  \ I came in to Dublin airport with my family, and we headed towards the city. Thinking\
  \ because it\u2019s Sunday night the ride there would be smooth. We discovered it\
  \ was a a bank holiday on that day, which meant everyone  was out bar hopping and\
  \ clubbing.\nThis was an experience I will always remember. We saw runabouts in\
  \ the streets and many cars. I watched the people on the city streets laugh, dance,\
  \ and even stumble as we made our way to the hotel. When we arrived, our hotel was\
  \ in fact a club underneath and all night we could hear the music beating and people\
  \ on the streets trying to get inside.\nBy morning the festivities have died down\
  \ and the club had turned into a breakfast area for hotel guest. This was just the\
  \ start of a day in Dublin. The weather was cold and it rain was in the forecast.\
  \ We walked to the famous Dublin prison where many died, were transported to Australia\
  \ and history was made. I learned how children were even thrown in the prison some\
  \ at age four for stealing an apple or loaf of bread. We learned about how the flag\
  \ stands for independence with orange being the Protestants, white being for hope\
  \ of peace and green meaning the Catholics/republicans from the revolution.\nLater\
  \ on we walked the city in search for the famous Guinness brewery. Where you can\
  \ tour the whole brewery, learning how Guinness was made, and how to properly pour\
  \ a Guinness beer. Even being informed how if the beer poured over, it was no longer\
  \ a good beer.\nAfter ventures in Dublin, I took a plane to Cork where we stayed\
  \ in a local bed-and-breakfast,where an elder man showed us the cemetery that he\
  \ up kept. The older man informed us how in the cemetery there was a church, and\
  \ while not much remained of the church, you could still see one of the sacred stones\
  \ that people believed if you rubbed on brought good luck. Not many of these stones\
  \ are around he informed us and many have been destroyed.\nAfter the cement art\
  \ tour, we began to pack up and go about our ventures on the west side of Ireland.\
  \ The man informed us that it rains twice a year in Ireland. He said it rains once\
  \ for five months and again for another six so we should probably grab our coats\
  \ and be prepared for more rain.  He wasn\u2019t wrong, as we made it to the cliffs\
  \ of Moher  it was very windy and on top of that rainy.  However, watching the waves\
  \ crash across the cliffs is a sight I\u2019ll never forget.\n When we reached Dingle\
  \ the sun had come out,  and in this little town we were able to see the spaces\
  \ that Star Wars film at.  You can tell that Ireland is very proud of this because\
  \ as you walk the streets of Dingle, you see Star Wars merchandise almost an every\
  \ store.  As we further traveled in the rain, we came across more landscapes some\
  \ covered in moss otherwise in shrubbery including ones with wild goats that we\
  \ had to run from at times. At Aran island, where famous wool sweaters are made,\
  \ I biked the entire island where we viewed  horses, seals, and even more goats.\
  \ We even had conversations with locals about the president where they too shared\
  \ some opinions about Trump. We even posed in front of his golf course as a little\
  \ humor for our family. There are many kind people and local shops that are adorable\
  \ and treats that are just as delicious. Having fresh fish and biscuits along with\
  \ traditional Irish breakfast that made the journey even more iconic. \nMy time\
  \ in Ireland was short and sweet. It was fun and packed with adventures. I learned\
  \ about the beehive huts that are throughout Ireland and even held a baby goat.\
  \ Learning a bit of history at the prison and island was thrilling and there is\
  \ so much more to learn and see in Ireland. A trip I will never forget."
