Text: "Within only a couple of hours, the landscape had changed dramatically; the\
  \ few small trees in the dry outback had steadily increased both in volume and in\
  \ quantity, and the colour scheme merged almost seamlessly from a palette of harsh\
  \ reds to one of luscious greens. With this new landscape, our group found once\
  \ we had left the comfortably air-conditioned van, came a new climate as well. In\
  \ numbers, the temperature had dropped from a boiling 41 degrees Celsius to a more\
  \ bearable 33 degrees. In feeling, however, it was a completely different story:\
  \ welcome to the ever-humid tropics, where you will find sweat in places you had\
  \ only ever previously experienced it in saunas, without actually leaving your chair.\
  \ Moreover, the animal population was completely different as well: had the flocks\
  \ of flies in the outback instantly turned your touristy fly net - initially purchased\
  \ laughingly as a souvenir you surely wouldn't r\xE9ally be needing - into your\
  \ most valuable possession, here the mosquitoes were your worst enemies, together\
  \ with the crocodiles that could be lurking in every shallow pool of water.\n\n\
  Yet all of these changes, however sudden and impressive, were to be expected. The\
  \ one thing I didn't expect to find, was an entire frog family chilling in the toilet's\
  \ flush basin at our campsite for the night. Whilst I was contentedly emptying my\
  \ bladder after the day's last long drive, a piercing scream from the cubicle next\
  \ to mine told me that someone else was not quite so happy with the sight of these\
  \ much-anticipated toilets. \"Admittedly,\" I thought in my blissfully unaware state\
  \ that was soon to be shattered, \"these toilets are far from the cleanest I have\
  \ ever seen, but surely not so appalling that they deserve this reaction?\" It did\
  \ not help, of course, that the girl had been a bit dramatic all along, worrying\
  \ about her nails and complaining about the nights we spent sleeping outside under\
  \ the breathtaking, non-light-polluted starry sky. When I discovered the source\
  \ of her abhorrence, however, I could not prevent a smile from appearing on my face.\
  \ The lid of her toilet was placed on its basin in a crooked angle, and in the gap\
  \ that had therefore appeared, five brightly green creatures were curiously peering\
  \ out into the world beyond their ever-refreshing source of water. \"How clever\
  \ of them to have picked this as their home!\" was all I could bring out to my terrified\
  \ fellow traveller, who threw a look of disgust at me before disappearing into the\
  \ frog-less cubicle I had just vacated. She left me wondering whether my reaction\
  \ had made me lose a possible friend in this dissatisfied girl. But then again,\
  \ I had just gained an entire group of happy slippery ones."
