Text: "Pink tea. Kashmiri chai. Noon tea. There are many different names for this\
  \ obscure, yet delicate tasting beverage. It is a traditional dish, originating\
  \ from the exotic north of Pakistan, where warm drinks are necessary to combat the\
  \ intense winters which they must bravely face.\n\nMy flight back to my home country\
  \ was rather comfortable. I couldn\u2019t imagine a more delightful way to spend\
  \ my time than to sink into the supple leather recliners and read. My travel back\
  \ to my hometown however, was a blur of immigration checks, long queues; having\
  \ very few Punjabi speaking officials to ask for help didn\u2019t ease my stress.\
  \ I gripped onto my younger brother\u2019s arm as tightly as I could muster and\
  \ feigned as much confidence as my fragile, scared self would allow. Hundreds of\
  \ voices flooded me as I walked towards the exit. \n \nAfter arriving to my father\u2019\
  s home, I spent the next few days gathering the strengths to partake in the festivities.\
  \ Before I knew it, the ceremony has begun. Crowds of distant relatives flock me\
  \ to enquire about things of little relevance.Thankfully, the event progressed smoothly.\n\
  \ \nAfter the large crowds of doting guests disappear into the night, I lingered\
  \ in the hall. My father holds a drink in his hand. I plucked it from his hand and\
  \ took a sip. My eyes widened. He told me that there was only one cup left in the\
  \ vat he poured it from. To my horror, I see my uncle walking towards it.\n\nThe\
  \ dainty way in which I held myself in front of the colourful wedding crowd dissipated\
  \ as I locked eyes with my uncle. His eyes narrowed. They darted towards the vat\
  \ holding the precious liquid and back at me. I hitched up the hem of my dress and\
  \ sprinted as fast as my numb legs could carry me towards it. Smirking wickedly,\
  \ he poured the remaining Kashmiri chai into a polystyrene cup. I hung my head in\
  \ defeat- until he pours his cup of tea into mine, smiling softly smiling softly.\
  \ \n'Guests should be treated like royalty.'  he murmurs.\n\nThe day after the wedding,\
  \ the air of celebration still lingers as the ladies hang up their clothes, gifts\
  \ litter the main rooms- and the men take to smoking outside. No-one stirs till\
  \ well past noon- and our meals compose of leftovers from the extravagant wedding\
  \ food.\nAt 11pm, a loud honk pierces the pristine silence.\n\u2018Zobia! Hurry\
  \ up and come outside\u2019\nI race into the garden and see a feminine figure standing\
  \ inside a convertible waving at me.\n\u2018Don\u2019t keep me waiting!\u2019 she\
  \ calls across the vast expanse of land. I race toward the car and leap in. My uncle\
  \ in the driver\u2019s seat, my father in the front passenger\u2019s seat, and my\
  \ cousin Fatima. As we speed into the distance before our mothers can forbid us\
  \ from going out so late I glance outside the window of the car. Flashing light\
  \ illuminate my face, road signs in Urdu litter the roadside. We share the roads\
  \ with three-wheeled rickshaws, embellished with small mirrors to Horse-drawn carriages\
  \ holding many exotic fruits and vegetables. We go from the loud main roads of Gujranwala\
  \ city, to small sideroads weaving in and out of the streets. The smell of freshly\
  \ ground spices fills the air, but it is masked by the smog and pollution blanketing\
  \ the air around us. After a short moment, we come to a slow stop outside a quaint\
  \ sweet\u2019s parlour. I remain in the car whilst my Uncle leaves to buy the mysterious\
  \ delicacy that he has so diligently drove for. I visibly flinch as he knocks on\
  \ my window, holding two cups. I open the door as he enthusiastically handed it\
  \ to me.\n\u2018Take a sip!\u2019 he encourages. Instantly, my mouth is greeted\
  \ with the sweet familiar taste of my newly beloved Kashmiri chai. A sweet, floral\
  \ taste entered my mouth for a split second, before being dominated by an influx\
  \ of cardamom and other spice flavours. The milk in the tea soothed my throat as\
  \ I gulped every last drop of it down my throat. It left a distinct, yet delicate\
  \ flavour in my mouth."
