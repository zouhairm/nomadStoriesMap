Text: "Uganda is such a beautiful country with very distinct and eye catching scenery.\
  \ This was my opinion just after the breath taking trip l had to Western Uganda,\
  \ 229 kilometers from the city center (Kampala) which is equivalent to 142 miles\
  \ if one traveled by air. The cool air and skin numbing coldness with in Lake Mburo\
  \ National Park, is heart warming and life affirming. Lake Mburo National Park is\
  \ located in Kiruhura District in the Western Region of Uganda. The Park is about\
  \ 30 kilometers ( 19 miles), by road, East of Mbarara, the largest city in the sub-\
  \ region. This location is approximately 240 kilometers ( 150 miles) by road, West\
  \ of Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. It's coordinates are 00 365,30\
  \ 57 E (latitude; 0 6000, longitude: 30 9500).\n             Before we dive into\
  \  the remaining details, let me give you a brief history of this park. Gazetted\
  \ in 1983 by the Obote regime, Lake Mburo National Park is referred to as a \"Lion\
  \ Conservation Unit\" it being the smallest of Uganda's Savannah National Parks.\
  \ With over three hundred bird species and a variety of animals such as Zebras,\
  \ Hippopotamus, Impala, Warthog, African Buffalo, Jackal, African Leopard, this\
  \ park encompasses the reality of Uganda's being the Pearl Of Africa. As evening\
  \ came, we were approaching the entrance gates of the park and we could not help\
  \ but notice an eye catching view of the lioness and its cubs crossing the road\
  \ just immediately after the gate. I for one was scared but excited at same time.\
  \ This looked too safe however insecure it felt. My colleagues l was with just started\
  \ taking impromptu pictures scaring away the wild cats because of the different\
  \ flashing lights from their cameras. Briefly after settling in, a camp fire was\
  \ lit and we gathered around for a memorial conversation which lasted for one hour\
  \ seeing us off to bed later that night. I was really anxious about the next day\
  \ because l really wanted to tour the park but all l could think of at that time\
  \ was the amble with which these cats walked away as we were entering the park.\
  \ \n             Sweet harmonious and appealing sounds from the different birds,\
  \ got us up in the right gear for the long awaited game drive. Off we headed for\
  \ breakfast as the car engines were warming up in preparation for the long game\
  \ drive through the National Park. It was on this very game drive, that  the tour\
  \ guide endeavored to tell us more about the different animals and nature in the\
  \ wild but what was catchy to my ears, which l refer to as the \"unexpected\" was\
  \ the African Leopard. For the record ladies and gentlemen, this an endangered species\
  \ within the Savannah Grasslands of Africa. But there it was right before my eyes\
  \ and could not believe what l  was seeing. Panthera Pardus ( scientific name) grows\
  \ to a length of 4-6.25 feet, weighing 60 kilograms for the males and 35-40 kilograms\
  \ for the females respectively. Despite the fact that the wild cats are solitary\
  \ animals, they are usually seen together during the mating season. With a life\
  \ span of 12 years, young ones of these wild cats, are born with their eyes closed\
  \ but what shocked me the most is that this animal is highly meticulous about where\
  \ it places its front paws during a stalk, lest the placement of the paws makes\
  \ a noise that can alert their prey of their  presence and in addition, they put\
  \ their hind paws in the exact spot whee they placed their front ones. This is why\
  \ looking at a Leopard's pry-marks, it seems like it is a two footed animal.\n \
  \                  In conclusion, my trip to this place was one worth remembering\
  \ and writing about because l do believe in sharing such stories for who knows,\
  \ someone might get inspired or even pick interest in  experiencing this as well.\
  \ My old friend once told me to ensure that l live long enough and l  would see\
  \ everything. To cut the long story short, it was a trip of a life time and a vacation\
  \ well spent in the confines of Lake Mburo National Park."
