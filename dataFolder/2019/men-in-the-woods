Text: "The woods have always been my thing, my connection with nature, my deepest\
  \ calling. I\u2019d thought I\u2019d be truly happy if I could made it my home.\
  \ However, my trip to Nam Cat Tien, a tropical forest in southern Vietnam, has seeped\
  \ an unprecedented melancholy into my perception of the woods.\n\nNight fell and\
  \ blanketed us with utter tranquility. I was sitting at the balcony of the Rangers\
  \ Station, flashing my torch upon the lake surface where dozens of red eyes emerged,\
  \ surfing smoothly just above the water level, blinking, and disappearing back into\
  \ the cold lake. Crocs. We were in the middle of the Cat Tien National Park, where\
  \ lies a beautiful but formidable Crocodile Lake, home to over 300 individuals.\
  \ From the bushes escaped a strange cry like a lost calf calling out to his mom,\
  \ but the pitch was much lower, so dry and coarse as if he\u2019d been having a\
  \ chronic sore throat from all the bawling. But it was no buffalo. That was how\
  \ the crocodiles cried.\nLooking up, I realized I\u2019d been trapped in the city\
  \ for so long, I couldn\u2019t even remember the last time I saw that many stars.\
  \ Deer started to move out, scavenging for food. I could spot them with my flashlight.\
  \ The nocturnal chill wind filled my lungs as my eyes followed the careening fireflies\
  \ up from the grass dunes. Suddenly, on a distant mound, a flame lit up, dancing\
  \ back and forth like an inflatable flailing tube man waving his arms uncontrollably.\
  \ This is the forbidden forest and fires can only be set by Rangers who were all\
  \ in the same room behind me. Vy, a resident Ranger, patted my shoulder and said,\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s cold. Spirits out there need to keep warm too\u201D. \n\nI met\
  \ Vy not long ago on my tour guide part-time job showing kids to the Wildlife Rescue\
  \ Center. Agile despite his small build, he was a knowledgeable man who devoted\
  \ his whole life to the forest. I\u2019ve always liked his presence, warm and accommodating.\
  \ Though I didn\u2019t understand why at times I sensed an indescribable sadness\
  \ around him. \n\nThat day when dawn broke, Vy greeted us at the National Park\u2019\
  s entrance with his usual cordial grin.\n\u201CWill you go back home for Tet?\u201D\
  \ I asked Vy.\n\u201CI\u2019ll still be here. Nowhere to return to anyway.\u201D\
  \ He replied with a forced smile.\nThat answer baffled me. \nA day flew by and we\
  \ reached the Rangers Station when the very last beams of sunlight were glancing\
  \ off the emerald green branches, reflected on the calm lake where water and sky\
  \ seemed to have beautifully meshed. I gulped in as much fresh air as I could and\
  \ tasted every sweet sip of the peaceful atmosphere. Wildlife were making their\
  \ ways home. So was everyone. But not these Rangers. They had to stay protecting\
  \ the forest, although it was only 2 days until the Vietnamese Lunar New Year -\
  \ a time for family reunion.\nTaking a sip of wine, Tuan, the leader, shared about\
  \ their hard and dangerous life. Robbers don\u2019t usually fight back, but poachers\
  \ would kill. Thanh, the youngest one, now with tear-filled eyes, was waiting for\
  \ his mom\u2019s call at the so-called \u201CLove Window\u201D, the only place to\
  \ receive erratic signals. Toi was playing his guitar, chanting \u201CStation is\
  \ home, forest is fatherland\u201D, the spirit that got them through these nebulous\
  \ nights in the woods\u2026\nLater on that night, I woke up to the faint echoing\
  \ sound of the radio, their only entertainment. To my mind sprung the melody of\
  \ Rung La Thap (Low Leaves Forest), a war song grieving a soldier\u2019s yearnings\
  \ in the jungle. It went:\n\n\u201C...From the radio resonates a beautiful voice\n\
  Singing she\u2019d wholeheartedly love the poor and distant soldier.\nDeep in the\
  \ woods soars the voice\nBut deep in the woods, there is nothing\u2026\u201D\n \n\
  Morning dawned upon us again and Vy appeared to be in a hurry to see us off. When\
  \ bidding us goodbye, he said with a sad smile: \u201CSafe trips home guys. Gotta\
  \ visit mum at the cemetery. Happy New Year!\u201D\nI suddenly understood his earlier\
  \ reply to my question. \nHappy New Year, Vy, and our silent heroes."
