Text: "Nestled deep into Cape York\u2019s bushland, Nolan\u2019s Brooke is a deep\
  \ crossing. The once blue water was now a murky beige, the result of the soft, sandy\
  \ bottom being churned up over and over again. With our windows rolled up, our Ford\
  \ slowly made it\u2019s way down the bank to attempt our final creek crossing of\
  \ the Old Telegraph Track.   \nThe Track is a bit of a legend in Northern Queensland.\
  \ Carved out of the rainforest in 1885 to build receivers for a wire transmission,\
  \ the \u201Croad\u201D that was left behind when they were eventually dismantled\
  \ in 1987 has become a (roughly) 120km off-roading adventure that culminates at\
  \ the northern most point of the continent, or simply \u2018The Tip\u2019. Australians\
  \ from all over the country take on this challenge at the end of every wet season\
  \ and in 2017, Leigh and I wanted to \u2018give it a go\u2019, as the Aussies say.\
  \ \nWe had left the ocean and the Great Barrier Reef behind us in Cairns only four\
  \ days prior to arriving at Bramwell Junction, the last bit of civilization and\
  \ true start to the OTT. We had watched out of the window as the lush greenery of\
  \ the Daintree Rainforest transformed into termite mounds beside red-dirt roads.\
  \ \nAt Palm Creek, the inaugural crossing of the OTT, Leigh and I couldn\u2019t\
  \ help but notice that ours was the least equipped vehicle out of about a dozen.\
  \ Just as we were considering abandoning the wild over land track for the much tamer\
  \ by-pass route, an enthusiastic guy by the name of Benny encouraged us to \u2018\
  give it a go\u2019 and told us that if we got stuck he would pull us out. \nBack\
  \ in the truck, Leigh made a careful, calculated descent down the steep bank of\
  \ Palm Creek, easily split the shallow waters, and then made a roaring climb up\
  \ on the other side. We had made it! We got back out of the truck to cheers and\
  \ high fives from Benny, who introduced us to his wife Peggie-Sue, their son Jack,\
  \ and their friends Cass and her husband Eddie. Just like that, a convoy was born.\
  \ \nThe trail was rough and narrow and creek crossings could only be made one vehicle\
  \ at a time. Because of this, a seemingly short journey would take us four days\
  \ to complete. As two of only four foreigners that year to attempt this trail, Leigh\
  \ and I were becoming a bit famous as the days passed. When we came to Gunshot Creek,\
  \ locals were sitting on lawn chairs in the shallow water, drinking beers and watching\
  \ us take turns driving though the \u2018S\u2019 shaped creek to climb the steep,\
  \ muddy hill on the other side. It was here that, after two or three attempts up\
  \ the hill, our little Ford settled deep into the thick mud that had formed after\
  \ several dozen wet vehicles had ascended before us. Eddie was more than happy to\
  \ use his tow rope for the first time to haul us out. \nOn our final evening, after\
  \ coming out the other side of Nolan\u2019s Creek, we set up at the busy campsite\
  \ that was filled by all those who\u2019s faces I had become familiar with on the\
  \ track. Car seats were scattered around the grass, drying out after a few drivers\
  \ had succumbed to the soft bottom of the creek. Despite this, spirits were high\
  \ and I think we all felt a sense of accomplishment as we neared the end of the\
  \ line.\nThe next morning, two kilometers after Nolan\u2019s, the bush linked up\
  \ with the by-pass road to take us to the Jardine River ferry, then to Bamaga. From\
  \ there, only 35 kilometers stood between us and The Tip. \n \tEventually the Old\
  \ Telegraph Track did end, and with it, the members of our bush gang went their\
  \ separate ways. I\u2019ll always remember the people who made that time as great\
  \ as it was; not only did they take the time to help out two strangers, they treated\
  \ us like family as they proudly showed off what their country had to offer. I\u2019\
  m happy to say that, like the OTT, our friendship has stood the test of time."
