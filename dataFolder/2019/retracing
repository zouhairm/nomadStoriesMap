Text: "The ice cream trickles on my hand in the open and undeniable to the 25 degrees\
  \ Celsius, sweat starts to form a stream down my neck like a scene that bodes a\
  \ fun walk in a small town 40 kilometers east of Milan. My innards crunch as butterflies\
  \ in my tummy seek escape. To date, I attest that my impulsiveness ends up either\
  \ in misfortunes or heaps of good luck to still get alive. \u201CMartina!\u201D\
  \ nearly 60 years old, ice cream parlor owner, throws a high-pitched name introduction\
  \ while handing my first meal after a morning train ride. \u201CFirst time here\
  \ and I\u2019m roaming solo,\u201D confided my love for puppy-eyed grandmas. When\
  \ earlier, a swarm of strangers in the train exchanged me purely nods of either\
  \ approval or otherwise, I came to the conclusion they barely understood me in English.\
  \ \u201CGood luck!\u201D she bids. The two-worded relief is just fitting to feed\
  \ a kick start of first solo excursion or is questionable for a gesture of staying\
  \ safe and dry.\n\nI\u2019m forming steps in cobblestoned alleys into a Lombard\
  \ Duomo piazza vibrating sights of Gothic restaurantes in bonanza. Topped up by\
  \ charming bundles of September bloom plastered on the verandas, I shift leg weights\
  \ while meandering, realizing a near-perfect experience. I smell of spring in the\
  \ middle of fall yet I mentally wander to last year\u2019s when my footing held\
  \ me in Barcelona\u2019s high-walled alleys with dark shadows casted by morning\
  \ light.\n\nEvidently out of radar on our way to Monserrat Mountains, we halted\
  \ to a stop in that spot to re-calibrate our phone directions. Uncertainty loomed\
  \ overhead, stuck in a maze that smelt of stale whiskey or arguably of pee, Jan,\
  \ my good friend, same built and age as me mumbled, \u201CNo GPS\u201D. I took out\
  \ my phone to check mine, a split second passed and a swift hand swiped it off.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t manage to squeak. Out of rationality, I ran after him, a few inches\
  \ taller than me that with mustache perfectly trimmed, a tidy-looking man was hardly\
  \ believed as thief. \n\nTravelers blame absence of minding safety or the lack thereof.\
  \ Barcelona tagged as world\u2019s pickpocket capital, I underestimated the dubious\
  \ number of Catalunian scams with the heinous crimes Philippines made me grow up\
  \ with. Otherwise, Barcelona\u2019s dark side is an overstatement when everywhere,\
  \ any crime lurks and peaks when opportunity arises. My first mainland Europe travel\
  \ made me question humanity as he politely begged \u201CPor pabor\u201D with arms\
  \ at his back wrangled by my unbelievably mighty muscles after a police report threat.\
  \ Or, the two policemen resigned to tossing the case away when 3 minutes past was\
  \ a near-death. What\u2019s worse than realizing few witnesses stood reluctant to\
  \ a seemingly typical Barcelona street show? Biased questions if being Asian\u2019\
  s a factor, nonsensical ideas and the like in introspection succumbed me to anxiety\
  \ towards close spaces, even in acclaimed safe places. \n\nMy stamina is as full\
  \ as the cappuccino cup I wolfed down the night before, my legs approve the strength\
  \ required of me to trail around in circles. I breathe in my best character impression\
  \ of Elio, in Call Me By Your Name book, and I start retracing his steps in famous\
  \ shoot locations in Crema, Italy; this thing honestly is what making my wits together.\
  \ \n\nBlood pools heavily now in my legs. The sunset is calling it a day. Rowdy\
  \ teenagers vandalizing walls in the street before me are in sight. Slightly quivering,\
  \ I sprint back only getting a longer return route to the train station. \u201C\
  How was Crema?,\u201D a middle-aged woman with binoculars peered behind the desk\
  \ at the station. We exchanged smiles. Today, I happily resigned to an old man with\
  \ a cane requesting a photo taken before the Crema Cathedral; trusted a restaurante\
  \ waiter to get behind my camera, agreeing the shots were perfect; walked up in\
  \ the alleys to test waters again. While not discounting past events, I\u2019m beginning\
  \ to grow back my muscle for faith in travelling and in humanity and to see how\
  \ wandering can be fulfilling. \n\nI mumble, unsure if she hears me, \u201CI travelled\
  \ anew\u201D and the train back to Milan chimes in the distance."
