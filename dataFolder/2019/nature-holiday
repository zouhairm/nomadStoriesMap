Text: "A planned trip should have a good planning. But, how if I traveled with my\
  \ own self without any planning list? Here I was at one of historical city in Indonesia,\
  \ Bandung.\n\nMy first step at Bandung was welcomed immediately by motorcycle rental\
  \ officer. I have contacted him before I flew from my departure city. I used that\
  \ motorcycle for my journey at Bandung.\n\nI turned on the motorcycle and started\
  \ to go. At the road, something showed up at my brain, \"Is it a right choice to\
  \ choose this place?\" This thought was bothering me until arrived at a interesting\
  \ place. The old town of Bandung. The building here depicts memories of Bandung\
  \ in the past. I parked my motorcycle and started to walk by my self. I walked around\
  \ near the building and take some pictures of it.\n\n\"Hi! it's that you?\" Suddenly\
  \ some one tapped me on the shoulder. \"Hi Aldo, what are you doing here?\"\n\n\
  I almost got heart attack because him. He is my old friend. We haven't met for a\
  \ long time. His name is Andreas.\n\n\"Hi... I just arrived here and I want to take\
  \ a little solo holiday. What about you?\" I asked him. \"Oh... good to see you\
  \ here. This is my last holiday here and I have to get my plane tomorrow morning.\"\
  \ he said. We talked many thing and he gave me some suggestion interesting places\
  \ to visit.\n\nNext early morning, I decided to visit \"Kampung Cireundeu\" this\
  \ is a village in Cimahi. Kampung Cireundeu took a several hours to get there from\
  \ Bandung. After arriving at the in front of Kampung Cireundeu, I walked by my self\
  \ about 100 meters to get home residents. Kampung Cireundeu is home for people who\
  \ still hold the ancestral beliefs called as \"Sunda Wiwitan\". \"Sunda\" is one\
  \ of tribe in West Java. The meaning of \"Sunda\" is  sun and \"Wiwitan\" means\
  \ the beginning. After walking for 5 minutes, I found an ethnic building called\
  \ as \"Balee Sarasehan\". Balee means a big hall and Sarasehan means assemble. So\
  \ the meaning of \"Balee Sarasehan\" can be a gathering place. Inside \"Balee Sarasehan\"\
  , there are calligraphy which means that \"People should realize that life in this\
  \ world is not alone but we live together with animals, plants, ocean, mountain,\
  \ sky, and another elements.\" In \"Balee Sarasehan\" I met the village headman\
  \ who assisted me to walk around the village.\n\nThe village headman invited me\
  \ to see the forest. According to Sunda Wiwitan's belief, there are 2 kind of forest:\
  \ first is forbidden forest that cannot be cut down because the function of this\
  \ forest is saving the water for custom society. The second is reforestation forest.\
  \ This forest can be cut down but people have to re-plant again with the new tree.\
  \ The uniqueness of Sunda Wiwitan people is the do not use any footwear. This is\
  \ related to their belief that nature is friend.\n\nAnother lesson that I got from\
  \ this solo travel is about Sunda Wiwitan's way of life. They said that people should\
  \ talk politely and carefully, people should have a good mutual cooperation, and\
  \ tolerate each other. \n\nAfter visiting Kampung Cireundeu, I got back to the hotel\
  \ and got ready to another interesting place. I think this is the right place to\
  \ visit."
