Text: "Almost as soon as we were underground, people on the tour started getting unnerved.\n\
  \n\u201CAre there bones on the whole tour?\u201D asked one man with a visibly shaken\
  \ partner clutching his arm.\n\nOur guide looked at him blankly for a moment, blinked,\
  \ and in heavily accented English informed him yes, the rest of the three hours\
  \ we would spend in the Paris Catacombs would be in the ossuary. Picture for a moment,\
  \ the quintessential guide for such an excursion underground: Tattooed, pierced,\
  \ combat boots, and a delightful way of slipping in a \u201Cwe\u201D whenever mentioning\
  \ folks who illegally enter the tunnels to explore the depths.\n\nI didn\u2019t\
  \ sneak away from the tour group so much as the tour group - perhaps in their haste\
  \ to escape the darkness - moved too quickly for my fanboying and I found myself\
  \ somewhat alone in front of an ornate display of skulls and bones. The fanned out\
  \ thighbones and carefully placed skulls formed lines and shapes in the wall of\
  \ bones and taking it in took time. I had waited a very long time to be standing\
  \ beneath this earth, seeing these human remains, and I wanted to savor the moment\
  \ of peace.\n \nStanding among the collected Parisian dead of hundreds of years,\
  \ breathing in the dust of the dead, I saw their faces in the darkness, felt their\
  \ collective energy and experience in the air around me. Numerous blocks of limestone\
  \ had been dragged from this space to build the beautiful city of Paris. Thousands\
  \ upon thousands of bodies were moved in to take the place of those stones, emptying\
  \ the city\u2019s overflowing cemeteries into a series of caverns, organized into\
  \ ornate designs. So much took place there and the memories of all those people\
  \ reverberated in my brain.\n\nMy wife and I are no strangers to what is called\
  \ \u201Cdark tourism\u201D these days. Sure, museums are nice, and you\u2019ll definitely\
  \ find us eating our way across any city we visit, but don\u2019t be surprised if\
  \ the majority of the photos we share after our return are of gravestones and mausoleums.\
  \ We wander cemeteries wherever we go.\n\nI heard her voice cutting through my reverie,\
  \ calling my name. The rest of the group was about to go through a locked gate and\
  \ I\u2019d be left behind if I didn\u2019t hurry up.\n\nI do not pretend to have\
  \ had some metaphysical experience. No ghosts floated before my eyes. But I emerged\
  \ from those tunnels transformed in an unexpected way. While my compatriots shivered\
  \ in the light rain and talked about how happy they were to be above ground, I felt\
  \ connected to the city, its occupants past and present, and the history of the\
  \ place in a new way."
