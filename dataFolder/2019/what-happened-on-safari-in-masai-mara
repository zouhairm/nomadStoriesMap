Text: "I am an avid traveler with dyslexia and dyspraxia. I was born in Kenya and\
  \ have not been back since I was 6 and that was 16 years and in 2017 I went back.\
  \  I went to the magnificent  Massai marra but it was no ordinary safari. Our jeep\
  \ broke down and we had to wait for another one for about 4 hours stranded in the\
  \ middle of Massai Marra hoping there were no lions coming.\n\nIt was the best month\
  \ to see the wildebeest migration but as we where stranded we mist it.  but instead\
  \ of feeling down were missing the best times in the morning to see all the animals.\
  \ our tour guide was Maasai and he was telling us all about his life. W was also\
  \ surrounded by lots of Zebras which was lovely.\n\nFinally, at 2pm we go a new\
  \ jeep and went to try and see the wildebeest migration but all we got was them\
  \ lining up to cross.  We still o to see lots of wonderful animals and just having\
  \ another safari trip brought back memories of when I was living in Africa going\
  \ on safari every year going mad every time I saw one of the big 5.  All in all,\
  \ it was an experience I will never forget. \n\nMy travel blog is www.travelweekli.com"
