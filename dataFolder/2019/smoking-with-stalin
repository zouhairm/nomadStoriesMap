Text: "Moscow is full of tourists. But I do not care. I place myself at the center\
  \ of Red Square and I imagine that I am alone. If you try hard, the sound of the\
  \ camera shutters and the voices disappear. Everything disappears. If I look forward,\
  \ the Basilica of St. Basil. On the right side, the Kremlin. On the left, one of\
  \ the greatest shopping centers I have ever seen, the GUM. And behind me, the State\
  \ Historical Museum.\n\nBeing here, the first thing that comes to my mind is when\
  \ Tom Cruise infiltrated the Kremlin. I'm a big fan of espionage movies. Ever since\
  \ I was a kid, I've been fascinated by cinema. My passion for the spies of the seventh\
  \ art began with the Saint, by Van Kilmer.\n\nI am about to enter the Lenin Mausoleum.\
  \ Before getting in, you pass through a security arch and an area between the Kremlin\
  \ wall and the rest of the Red Square. In it, there is a necropolis with several\
  \ busts of different leaders of the Soviet Union. Stalin's bust is the only one\
  \ where people leave flowers. The others are desolate, no withered flowers that\
  \ someone has left long before.\n\nI enter the Mausoleum and Lenin is in there.\
  \ It is not a bust or a figure. It is him. I let myself be guided by the velvety\
  \ cord to reach the end of the room. I open the curtains that separate the interior\
  \ room with the daylight and the flash happens. Between the change of light and\
  \ the bad feeling I have after seeing a corpse, I feel like Dracula enjoying a sunrise.\
  \ The most impressive thing is that he lived until the beginning of the last century,\
  \ and you realize that his face is the same as that you can find in any historical\
  \ archive or on the Internet.\n\nI thought about digesting that experience at one\
  \ of the many showcases of the Shopping Center. It was also starting to rain and\
  \ I could take shelter for a while. My surprise was that when I arrived in Moscow\u2019\
  s Kazan Cathedral on Nikolskaya Street there were Lenin, Vladimir Putin, Stalin\
  \ and Ivan the Terrible. It may seem like the beginning of a joke, but it was not.\
  \ Four men in costume to offer pictures to the tourists in exchange for a few rubles.\
  \ At that moment, Stalin approached to ask me for a light.\n\nAfter the courtesy\
  \ questions between us, I could not resist. This time, I was willing to kill the\
  \ curiosity for the cat to live. I asked him why there was such devotion for Stalin.\
  \ He answered that, although he did not agree with what the society of the Soviet\
  \ Union perceived after the war, it was that Stalin was the person who put an end\
  \ to it. With the passage of time that feeling has not disappeared, it has become\
  \ stronger through the streets of the Russian capital. The truth is that his answer\
  \ left me speechless.\n\nIf I had gone through the side of these people as a tourist,\
  \ they would have offered me a photo. But when they approach you for a reason, you\
  \ have the opportunity to meet the real person who is behind the disguise.\n\nI\
  \ must admit that I was shocked to speak with someone disguised as a historical\
  \ character as was Stalin. It is not just because his resemblance was more than\
  \ reasonable, but also because I do not imagine talking to another character of\
  \ this nature in any other country in the world. In some countries, carrying symbology\
  \ related to such a regime would be considered a crime, while in others, the social\
  \ pressure would not allow a person to wear this type of costume.\n\nThe point is\
  \ that all we know is by contrast. Since we have had the use of reason, or even\
  \ before, we have all wanted to believe that there must be the figure of good and\
  \ evil and, in this case, a hero and a villain. Thanks to this obsession, today\
  \ I was able to smoke a cigarette with Stalin in the Red Square in Moscow."
