Text: "Morocco, February 2015. My first time in North Africa. \nOn a Ryanair flight\
  \ directed to Marrakech, my journey started with an old man on the plane who smiled\
  \ and said \"As-salam alaykum, welcome to my Home\". \n\nTwo days later, I was reaching\
  \ the ruins of A\xEFt Benhaddou's Ksar, and realised that was the first time I would\
  \ have seen the desert. All I could notice from the window of the jeep until the\
  \ very line of horizon was an expanse of rocks, dust, and mountains of the Atlas\
  \ chain. \nIt was early afternoon when I have been greeted by a caravan who stopped\
  \ right outside of the ruins. The sun was high up in the sky, our shadows were short\
  \ and the temperature at its peak. I would have sold my soul in order to get a glass\
  \ of fresh water.\nThey offered me hot mint tea, instead. The best I have ever had\
  \ in my life, mind you. It tasted of welcome and hospitality. \nAfter having cooled\
  \ down from the journey, they offered to help me wearing a turban. \"They must have\
  \ realised I have no clue how to do it\", I thought, thanking them in French.\n\
  That day, I wished I knew Arabic. I could see the different expression they had\
  \ when speaking in French to me. As a foreigner, I carry the burden of the past\
  \ mistakes my country has made in North Africa until not so long ago. I did not\
  \ want them to feel as I expected them to speak my language, but at least I could\
  \ converse with whoever I met, expressing my gratitude for their help.\n\nI entered\
  \ the ruins. It's funny how little details my mind remembers of the place itself,\
  \ while recalling everything about Badr. \nHis turquoise robe, the white turban,\
  \ the long, grey beard. The ditches on his face, dug by a long life full of harsh\
  \ times. But a full one, at least. Can't say if I found his shop stand by mistake\
  \ or rather fate, but there was a clear reason for our encounter. It happened while\
  \ I was walking through the narrow streets of the fort, when I heard music. A soft\
  \ tune, clearly in a minor key, probably a double harmonic scale, more commonly\
  \ known as \"Arabic scale\". I couldn't resist. I started looking for the source\
  \ of the melody, almost hypnotised, or maybe possessed by it. That's how we met.\
  \ He was playing his Khamanjah. \n\nI saluted him. More tea had been served. It\
  \ started as a small chat, talking about our common interest into music. We finished\
  \ the tea. I couldn't see what his commodity consisted of, he had no clothes or\
  \ souvenirs of any sort exposed. So I asked him how did he make a living. \"Paper\
  \ and tea\" he replied laughing. \nHe was clearly enjoying my confused look, so\
  \ he showed me his art. \"I did not attend school when I was a kid, I come from\
  \ a family of farmers\". He turned on a stove and started to adjust its flame. \"\
  But you know, I didn't fit with all that heavy labour, I liked drawing instead\"\
  . He started brewing more tea. \"I made it my passion and my job, but with a twist\"\
  . The tea was ready, I helped him get the glasses, but he smiled and took paper\
  \ instead. He put the paper on top of the stove, at enough distance to not let it\
  \ burn, and started pouring tea on it. Then, he started to paint with a brush, using\
  \ the hot tea at different temperature to form colours. He drew a dromedary and\
  \ a palm, in the desert, and signed it. 'Badr'. I was amazed. I bought one of his\
  \ paintings, and he gifted me the sketch of the dromedary. \"Good conversations\
  \ are a rarity and a gift nowadays\" he said, always smiling. \n\nIt was late afternoon\
  \ when the jeep's engine started. Everything started to turn purple. A wonderful\
  \ sunset could be seen surmounting the Atlas. \nThe rocks and the dust were maybe\
  \ not as majestic as the central Sahara, but as I looked behind me, I realised I\
  \ discovered that deserts are not inhospitable at all."
