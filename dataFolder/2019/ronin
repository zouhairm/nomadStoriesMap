Text: "Visiting Japan was an old dream of my brother and I since we were two geeks\
  \ obsessed with cartoons with overdeveloped schoolgirls and golden haired martial\
  \ artists that would put Superman to shame. But for a long time, it was nothing\
  \ but that; an idea to dream fantasize about, but never truly expect to see it coming\
  \ true; be there to be heard, touched, seen, smelled and tasted.\n\nBut,  the thing\
  \ is, we reached to the idea we either talk seriously about the things we aspire\
  \ to, and work hard to make them a reality, or we're just deluding ourselves. And\
  \ if we're doing precisely that, what other subjects could be talking that way?\
  \ Always planning, never really intending to actually do and put in practice.\n\n\
  And to be fair, we were not the same dreaming teens as before; we were grown ups,\
  \ or the next best thing two millenials could become at the very least. We both\
  \ finally landed on decent-paying jobs. I was the luckiest one, I would say; being\
  \ able to make a middle class income for just a couple of hours of work a day, and\
  \ all of it from my home (I know: I sound like spam on a comment section). \n\n\
  My brother was stable as well. and he even got a girlfriend who he thought he could\
  \ write a story together; she truly seemed at the time as the one.\n\nAnd then,\
  \ everything fell apart once we bought the tickets and planned our trip to Japan.\n\
  \nMy girlfriend broke up with him. The reason? I don't really think I have it quite\
  \ clear yet, and I don't think my brother either. And I had to be there for him,\
  \ to show him that life goes on, and he was better than these circumstances.\n\n\
  Then, the payment on my job was reduced dramatically. With one third of what I used\
  \ to earn. And suddenly, well, I found myself in the situation where I had to show,\
  \ don't tell; to prove I was indeed, better than the circumstances. And the best\
  \ way to do it, was to not succumb to my first instinct; cancel the whole trip,\
  \ and wait for things to improve. No, this was our adventure, and even if life took\
  \ a lot from us in the areas where we were more sensitive, the Japan plan would\
  \ go on.\n\nNow, the dream became a memory, and I'm not saying that on a bad way:\
  \ I still have to find a better job, and my brother, a better love. But as depressed\
  \ as I might feel at times, I know I can always go to that mindspace, and remember\
  \ the seven days where our feet meet that soil; the soil that witnessed stories\
  \ about samurais, ninjas and geishas. To know that we could make our way in the\
  \ other side of the world, and that we were able to always follow our steps back\
  \ home.\n\nFor one week, our problems could wait; at that time, all it mattered\
  \ was to taste the most authentic food and buy all the geeky toys of our favorite\
  \ anime heroes we could afford. \n\nI still fear about the future; I don't know\
  \ if I'd ever find a job as good as the one I used to brag about, and I'm not sure\
  \ if my brother would ever find true love. But we both know now we can go to wherever\
  \ we haven't tested our chances. Maybe there, we will find a better fortune. Maybe."
