Text: "Awe to Travel they say! \"Wow-you are so lucky.\"  No, travel is not Luck,\
  \ I assure them it is a choice, it is MY choice. Travel has not only been my choice\
  \ but it has been my greatest teacher, my most challenging examines, and my most\
  \ rewarding job yet!  \n\nI have driven through the Tuscan countryside, bobbed in\
  \ the Blue Grotto, slept in a Castle in Ireland, Sailed the Wachau valley, stood\
  \ in the Scottish Highlands, walked the streets of a 13th century village in France,\
  \ and in each of those incredible settings the one thing I was most astounded to\
  \ find was ME - my true self! Yes, there I was not only in awe of the beauty around\
  \ me, but in awe of my personal abilities which brought me to each and every one\
  \ of these incredible locations.  I found something in my travels I didn't know\
  \ I was looking for, I found  me!   \n\nYou learn so much about yourself as a person\
  \ when you travel, especially when traveling alone. It is then you will find your\
  \ true self; the person who exists outside of the day to day box which we tend to\
  \ exist in. \n\nTravel can be a scary time, but incredibly rewarding. It teaches\
  \ you exactly what you are made of & forces you to face your fears. All the things\
  \ you have been taught in life, Travel is the time to put those skills to work.\
  \ You start with communication- you have to ask questions and figure out day to\
  \ day things like: your schedule, a map, where is the hotel? You will find you conquer\
  \ the fear of asking questions quite quickly. That fear seems to melt away as you\
  \ are in survival mode. To communicate is to survive in the unknown world. You realize\
  \ asking for directions wasn't so hard after all & it actually filled you with exuberance\
  \ of having your first conquest under your belt. With a new-found confidence and\
  \ a bit of pep in your step, you are off to explore the unknown world and see the\
  \ sights you have dreamt of.\n You, being an educated adult, believe you are well\
  \ versed in World history. That is, until you start listening to your tour guide,\
  \ or perhaps are lucky enough to meet a local who opens up and shares with you they\
  \ just happened to have had a relative who lived during that time and all of a sudden\
  \ you are privy to a whole new world of information about the place you came to\
  \ see.  At this point you are smacked in the face with the realization, without\
  \ this trip, you would have never known what you know now!   This is an \"aha moment\u201D\
  \ Yes, this is it, this is the stuff they didn\u2019t tell you in school. You are\
  \ now filled with amazing excitement, which is starting to bubble up on the inside\
  \ as you have been filled with this new wealth of knowledge and you giggle as it\
  \ hits you, this is what you were not expecting to find.  The YOU- You connected,\
  \  You opened up, and You are thrilled with your new knowledge which you are eager\
  \ to share with others, & become the story teller you never knew you were meant\
  \ to be. \n\n This is why I choose to travel for the You , which you  meet along\
  \ the way.  It will give you a new-found confidence about yourself, and reveal a\
  \ whole new part of YOU! You understand you have the tools to survive, to ask questions,\
  \ to get from point A to point B. You have been tested and you passed. You realized\
  \ what you know about world history is truly just the tip the iceberg, and it will\
  \ spark  a flame with in you that burns hot for more knowledge and more adventure.\
  \  OMG- it is YOU ?  \nThis is why you travel, not for the incredible sights, delicious\
  \ food, or a walk-through history, no YOU travel to find your true self, and it\
  \ is amazing.    \n\"To travel is to Live! \" If you travel far enough you will\
  \ find yourself. Nothing could be truer than True-  and YOU are worth the trip!"
