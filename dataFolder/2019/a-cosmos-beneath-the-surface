Text: "A light ocean breeze caresses the turquoise blue waters of the secluded Jolly\
  \ Buoy Island. A name so outlandish, that it is rivaled only by the cotton-candy\
  \ clouds framing the horizon. Standing on the warm sandy beach overlooking the Indian\
  \ Ocean you almost forget the hour and a half long boat ride and the stringent security\
  \ checks it took to get there. The bewitching natural phenomenon and vistas of Jolly\
  \ Buoy belong to a string of islands that are preserved by law, under the umbrella\
  \ of the Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park. The locals proudly refer to Jolly\
  \ Buoy as a rare ocean pearl; so rare in fact that the island is protected by the\
  \ Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and only a controlled number of people are permitted\
  \ to visit this untouched island on any given day. \n\nEarly in the morning, select\
  \ ferry agents scramble tourists into a line, snaking outside the official counter\
  \ of the Marine Park. For Rs 1000-1500 you can cover your entrance and camera equipment\
  \ fee for taking pictures. A meager price to pay for a view that is unadulterated\
  \ with the throng of tourists. The authorities also hand you a water flask to keep\
  \ you hydrated, as the Marine Park is a plastic free zone to let the flora thrive\
  \ in its natural habitat. \n\nThe boat ride that follows is an amalgamation of several\
  \ emotions all at once; excitement, intrigue, and serenity. The local guides start\
  \ off the trip with a safety guideline, followed by what you could tell was a love\
  \ for the sea. A language that said, \"Welcome to my home, and I am going to show\
  \ you something you will never forget\". As the trip continued there were Intrigued\
  \ glances from the tourists, towards the machine guns that glinted in the sunlight\
  \ as the park authorities kept an eye out for Poachers. And finally a sense of calm\
  \ serenity that takes over as you gaze at the green patches of thick mangroves littered\
  \ across the coastline. \n\nAs your boat approaches the island, the view is something\
  \ straight out of the book \"Treasure Island.\" You feel like an explorer who has\
  \ just discovered a place of immense calm and beauty. Truly a rare treasure in these\
  \ times of overcrowded tourist spots. The beach is a long spread of golden sand,\
  \ peppered with dark tree trunks and flora that have washed ashore over the years.\
  \ To the absolute credit to the authorities, there is no sign of wastage or plastic\
  \ anywhere in sight. Equally inviting is the warm, clear water, that tickles your\
  \ feet as you stand at the shore. \n\nThe local fishermen who have traveled along\
  \ with the ferry, are scouting the tourists to make a living. One of them approaches\
  \ me and greets me in the local dialect of Hindi. Smiling he asks me, \"Would you\
  \ like to see another world under the sea?\". A few negotiations later I find myself\
  \ taking a leap of faith and being led to a distance away from the handful of tourists.\
  \ \"I'll lead you by the hand. And at no point in time, should you let go,\" he\
  \ warns me. \"The currents here don't fool around. One slip, and we won't see you\
  \ for good.\" he meets me with a sharp gaze and then beckons me to follow him. \n\
  \nI put on the gear he hands me and wade into the comfort of the warm ocean with\
  \ the company of my personal guide. The moment I dive into the water the stark contrast\
  \ of the deep water hits me. A few meters away from the shore I find myself in dark\
  \ cool enveloping silence, broken only by the bustling marine life beneath the surface.\
  \ It feels like I'm floating in space and the fringing reefs of coral below bloom\
  \ like a cosmos of star-studded marine life. The hues of purple, red and yellow\
  \ coral sprawl on the ocean floor only interrupted by the equally vibrant and varied\
  \ fish that swim along minding their business. I hold my breath if only for a while\
  \ and float there, to etch into my memory what is one of the most beautiful experiences\
  \ of my life."
