Text: "The plan: you'll leave New York for three months and stay in your grandparents'\
  \ empty apartment in Terracina, Italy. You were there as a child, but you don\u2019\
  t remember that, just like you don\u2019t remember them. But surely they\u2019d\
  \ have wanted you to draft your novel in their old home on the Tyrrhenian coast.\
  \ \n\tThere\u2019s a palm tree-lined boardwalk along a pebbly beach, and a jagged,\
  \ witch\u2019s profile-shaped mountain floating in the sea. \"Good eye\", your new\
  \ neighbors say; \"Ulysses sailed through here. That mountain was the home of Circe.\"\
  \ You do feel bewitched as you ride your grandmother\u2019s rusty bicycle to the\
  \ centro, where you see a profumeria: you love perfume shops. You\u2019re sniffing\
  \ a fig scent when a voice says: \"Can I help you?\"\n\tHis voice.\n\nOther men\u2019\
  s voices have moved you; this one\u2019s a dagger through the heart. He\u2019s dark\
  \ and caveman-like with a disarmingly childlike grin; too handsome for you. But\
  \ each time you visit the profumeria, he materializes instantly, blushing and bearing\
  \ samples. One such night, you ask him for pizzeria recommendations, but he doesn't\
  \ bite. His co-worker calls him, and you leave the profumeria, mortified. \n\tThen,\
  \ behind you: \"Signorina!\"\n        Him. Asking you out.\n\nYou thought Lamberto\
  \ was too handsome for you, but every day there are gifts: perfume samples, pencils\
  \ \u2013 \"because you\u2019re a writer\" \u2013 and pasta al pomodoro that he makes\
  \ just for you. He climbs a tree to pick you pomegranates, cracking one open and\
  \ presenting you the gleaming rubies inside as though you are a queen. \n\tYour\
  \ Italian is terrible but somehow you talk until dawn. He rubs your shoulders in\
  \ front of Circe\u2019s mountain and when he holds you against his chest, it's like\
  \ coming home.\n\tHe laughs when you are wonderstruck by the Roman ruins. He lifts\
  \ you over the crumbling remains of a fortress wall. \n        He taps his heart:\
  \ \"When I first saw you, I was struck. I knew that you knew me, and that I knew\
  \ you. You make me see old things in a new way.\" \n        He pauses. \"You have\
  \ a beautiful mind.\"\n\n\nBut you\u2019re leaving Italy. What\u2019s he hiding?\
  \ He\u2019s a stranger!\n\tHe says he\u2019ll take you to Naples; you\u2019re silent.\
  \ After he says the beautiful thing about your beautiful mind, he asks: \"Now why\
  \ do you like me?\" You respond: \"You show me around.\" You tell everyone you're\
  \ just friends \u2013 even if every time you see him your knees buckle. Don\u2019\
  t look at him! He asks why you never look at him. You shrug. \t\n\tSo Lamberto finds\
  \ a much younger local girl to cook for. Her Facebook photos are all duckface selfies.\
  \ It doesn't matter; she can tell him the things you couldn\u2019t, and he picks\
  \ her pomegranates now. He thinks her mind is beautiful now. \n        You've broken\
  \ your own heart.\n\n\nYour defense was that you were leaving Italy, but months\
  \ pass. Your Italian friends ask: \"Why are you still here?\" You don\u2019t know.\
  \ You like Circe\u2019s witchy kaleidoscope sunsets. There\u2019s a bar where you\
  \ write; the whirring of the espresso machine like Pavlov\u2019s bell for words.\
  \ You like growing tomatoes on your grandparents\u2019 balcony and learning new\
  \ things: prosecco is not just for New Year\u2019s; traffic laws are optional; burrata\
  \ is life. And, of course, anytime you glimpse Lamberto across the piazza, your\
  \ knees still buckle. Sometimes you find each other and talk on Roman ruins until\
  \ dawn, just like before. Your Italian\u2019s better now. Tell him you made a mistake!\
  \ But you just can\u2019t. Your applications for jobs in New York: zero response.\
  \ Writing? Maybe something \u2013 you finish your novel and begin publishing travel\
  \ articles. Months become years and, bitterly, you accept that Lamberto was never\
  \ for you. You know him now; he\u2019s erratic and unhappy, tearing through young\
  \ girls like paper. \n         But thanks to him, your life is in Italy and, finally,\
  \ after years of regret, you find real love with a gentle man. And there is joy\
  \ between the cracks of sorrow; delight in seeing where the dominoes scatter. You\
  \ have nothing to tell Lamberto anymore, but maybe you could thank him. Someday.\n\
  \         Bartolomeo says: \"I\u2019m from Calabria. You\u2019re from New York.\
  \ We met in Terracina.\"     \n         \"Yes,\" you say. \"I know.\""
