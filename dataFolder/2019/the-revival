Text: "The call to prayer comes funneling out of a thousand minarets at dawn, cutting\
  \ through the lethargy of the heavy monsoon air. Carried by the rain bearing winds,\
  \ it slips through narrow streets, into the cracks between wooden window shades,\
  \ over the tombs where bygone emperors are at rest and through empty palaces where\
  \ treachery and deceit once ruled. It flies over people sleeping under awnings,\
  \ and briefly wakes up a boy who has nodded off in the middle of his exam preparation.\
  \ A burglar stops dead in his tracks, for now it is daybreak and the city of Hyderabad\
  \ will soon awaken.\n\nWhat used to be the fiefdom of the Nizam of the Asaf Jahi\
  \ dynasty, at one time the richest man in the world, Hyderabad in South India is\
  \ a city that has learned to embrace the old and the new. Across the river Musi\
  \ lies the new city, a city that understands Bitcoins and Balenciaga. In the predominantly\
  \ Islamic Old City however, every call to prayer and courtesy shown by its hospitable\
  \ inhabitants, is a nod to a way of life that has not changed in centuries.\n\n\
  It\u2019s a good thing though that time has changed me. If I turn into an alleyway\
  \ and come across the younger me that had lived briefly in this city twenty years\
  \ ago, I doubt we\u2019d be able to have a conversation about the charms of the\
  \ city. It was a tumultuous time for me personally, a time of excitement and grief,\
  \ and I was living too much in my head, too obsessed with the here and the now-\
  \ a product of India\u2019s emerging economy- to appreciate history. I haven\u2019\
  t been back in many years and I\u2019m anxious now, even as a tourist. Would all\
  \ the old feelings of heartbreak come rushing back or would I finally be able to\
  \ see the city for its storied charms? \n\nThe tea seller across the road is happy\
  \ because it\u2019s not raining yet and that means his regular customers will line\
  \ up soon, for nothing ever starts in India without tea. He\u2019s asked me to visit\
  \ the 200 year old Chowmahalla palace, which used to be the seat of the Nizams,\
  \ recently renovated by Princess Esra, the estranged Turkish wife of the last Nizam,\
  \ Mukarram Jah. While Jah himself gave up the princely life and lived in Australia\
  \ for a while as a \u2018gentleman sheep farmer\u2019, and currently lives in a\
  \ two-bedroom apartment in Turkey, the Princess has been very active in managing\
  \ the property of the Nizams. \n\nNo corner of Hyderabad has been spared the Princess\u2019\
  s attentions. Falaknuma is the palace on the hill that\u2019s been taken over by\
  \ an upmarket hotel. One of the great guesthouses of the world in its heyday from\
  \ the late 19th century to the early 20th century, it hosted English and Russian\
  \ royalty until it fell into disrepair and had to be extensively renovated. Its\
  \ Italian and Tudor influenced architecture can be disconcerting in an Indian cityscape\
  \ until one realizes that the Nizams were the great travelers of their time and\
  \ brought back these influences into their way of life, from the way they dressed\
  \ to the crockery they used.\n\nIt\u2019s dinner time by the time I\u2019m done.\
  \ Hyderabadis may be divided in their opinion on politics and may argue over who\
  \ the greatest cricketer is, but any self-respecting Hyderabadi will tell you that\
  \ Hyderabadi Biriyani is the world\u2019s greatest biriyani, and anything else is\
  \ a poor copy. A fragrant basmati rice-based dish, with meat and spices cooked in\
  \ with the rice, the city is dotted with restaurants competing to make the best\
  \ biriyani.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long, tiring day by the time I hit my hotel bed.\
  \ I have a few more days to spend in the city, but I\u2019m feeling curiously at\
  \ peace with myself, with none of the anxiety that has dogged me over the previous\
  \ few days. \n\nThe final call to prayer goes out just as I drift off to sleep,\
  \ and I dream of kings and queens and of ordinary people watching the rain clouds."
