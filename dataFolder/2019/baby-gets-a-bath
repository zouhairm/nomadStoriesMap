Text: "The matriarch bustled about picking up the metal dishes from the breakfast.\
  \ Her grown sons loitered around the wagons smoking and talking. The sisters-in-law\
  \ compared finery, exchanging scarves and shawls, swapping rings and bracelets,\
  \ in a cloud of constant chatter.\n\nJanius, the teen age boy hung around Sonny\
  \ and me eager for our mimed conversation. I felt I should help the mother but my\
  \ offers were waved off. A hierarchy of tasks was at work here fully transparent\
  \ to them but behind the veil of culture to me.\n\nAll the while as she boiled the\
  \ water and washed the dishes the baby lay in the tent oblivious to anything but\
  \ his own savory toes. He seemed to be in the center of a stack of triangle\u2013\
  shaped pieces of cotton. They looked like those soft undershirts my grandpa used\
  \ to wear.\n\nThe grandmother continued working until all was washed and dried and\
  \ stored for the coming caravan trip. The sons were now beginning to engage in preparations\
  \ for departure and their wives did the same. Janius was playing Sonny\u2019s guitar\
  \ and I was watching the baby entertain himself.\nThe grandmother crossed from the\
  \ campfire to the tent carrying a basin of steaming water. She flashed me a gold-toothed\
  \ smile as she passed, necklaces jangling and skirt swooshing. I smiled back. \n\
  \nShe ducked slightly and entered the tent of the gurgling baby. At the sight of\
  \ her he broke into a huge grin and enthusiastically kicked out his legs. She put\
  \ down the basin and bent over him talking softly in soothing tones. She placed\
  \ her hand on his chest putting her little finger under one of his arms and her\
  \ thumb under the other. Imprisoned in her hand he still smiled and kicked  his\
  \ chubby legs.\n\nSuddenly she dive-bombed him head first into the water and shot\
  \ him back out. His smile disappeared only to be replaced by a deep scarlet, open-mouth\
  \ wail. Screaming bloody murder his feet and hands tried to ward off the advancing\
  \ enemy.  Without losing a beat she bulldozed his head with a bar of soap and crammed\
  \ soapy fingers into his nose and mouth and ears.  Bubbles sputtered from his mouth\
  \ as he spit and shrieked and kicked.\nBam.  Down he went head first back into the\
  \ basin. Once. Twice. Three times she dunked him and back up. The veins stuck out\
  \ in his neck against the crimson of his fury. Quickly she soaped him up and before\
  \ he could scream again, in he went. She raised him back out of the water amid squalls\
  \ and kicks and flailing arms. \n\nShe dried him and put his little convulsing body\
  \ on top of the pile of material, pinning his arms at his side. Thwap, thwap, right\
  \ over then left over, then right over, then left\u2014she wrapped each layer of\
  \ cloth over the screaming baby. Finally papoosed, his howling red face was the\
  \ only part of him still visible, demanding retribution.\n\nShe picked him up like\
  \ a miniature parcel and placed him in a sling suspended in the tent. He wailed.\
  \ He screamed. Swish, swish, she started the sling. One second later the red-faced,\
  \ screaming furious baby was fast asleep."
