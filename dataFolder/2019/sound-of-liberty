Text: "Almost a year ago, I was surfing the net when suddenly faced an article that\
  \ captured my attention. The headline said: \"12 things everyone should do alone\
  \ at least once in a lifetime\". As a lover of the self moments, I didn't think\
  \ twice before clicking the link. \n\nIn a quick look, I noticed that it was still\
  \ missing some good adventures to take pleasure in my own company. And, in a frustrating\
  \ hope to fill up the test, I started to check out everything that I had already\
  \ done all by myself.\n\nGo out and have dinner: check! Cook a meal: check! Go to\
  \ the beach and to the shopping mall: check! Go to a live show: chec\u2026 wait\
  \ there, WHAT?\n\nOk, ok. Some items there were easy to get done, like going to\
  \ the movies and appreciating a museum. But, GOING TO A SHOW? A LIVE ONE? ME, MYSELF\
  \ AND I? \"This is too much\", I thought.\n\nDisappointed, I closed the site as\
  \ suddenly as I'd clicked to read it. Then, I started wondering what kind of person\
  \ would go to a live show alone. Thought about the loneliness of sharing your favorite\
  \ song with strangers and the frustration of not having a second memory there to\
  \ keep the details that you would certainly forget with the passage of time. Sure\
  \ that the article had been written by a lunatic, I decide to keep my mental heath.\n\
  \nThere\u2019s an expression here in Brazil that says you should never say something\
  \ is impossible, because there\u2019s a good chance for the destiny to prove it\
  \ CAN happen. And that was the case.\n\nOne year after I read the \"12 things everyone\
  \ should do alone once in a lifetime\", I discovered one of my favorite bands would\
  \ come to my country. And, as if it was not enough, one of the shows was gonna happen\
  \ just some kilometers away from where I live. It was obvious a divine signal. I\
  \ had to go! Well, better... I had to find someone to go with me.\n\nI don\u2019\
  t remember being so insistent in my hole life. I asked my family, friends, colleges\
  \ and neighbors. Asked on the collage, work and even on the supermarket. But, besides\
  \ the exaggerations, I didn\u2019t find any live soul to go along with me.\n\nAlmost\
  \ quitting the desire of going to that show, I stopped for a minute and remembered\
  \ the article that I had read a year before. I had to admit: the lunatic was right.\
  \ I sure could go to a live show alone. Me, myself and I. Not only could as I gone.\n\
  \nThere, I lived one of the most incredible experiences of my life. It may not seem\
  \ much for you, but for me it was a story full of meanings. Besides appreciating\
  \ independence, I have some insecurity when the routine scapes form the usual. Not\
  \ having anyone to fall back makes me worried, and at that day I faced my emotions\
  \ with an open heart. \n\nThe show was amazing, I made some good friends and sang\
  \ as high as my wings can fly. I found out that the path to liberty lives inside\
  \ us, so you should never depend on nobody to make your dreams come true. In the\
  \ end, no one's gonna live it, but you. \n\n\n(PS: I've never made a huge trip abroad,\
  \ that's why my text is more focused on the feeling of freedom and liberty. Hope\
  \ you like and be able to notice some potential)."
