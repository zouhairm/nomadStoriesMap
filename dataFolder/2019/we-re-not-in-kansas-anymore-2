Text: "\u201CTurn him on his side\u201D I urged them, while making the hand motions\
  \ of a person rolling something. I hovered over the long leather seat in the center\
  \ of the old van while bouncing on the makeshift seat in the rear. I repeated the\
  \ instruction and was met with three sets of worried eyes, almost fluorescent against\
  \ their dark skin. \n\tThey couldn\u2019t understand me. This is the language barrier\
  \ I had been expecting but the realization of it was at this most inopportune moment.\
  \ Someone needed to turn the boy on his side before he choked to death from the\
  \ blood. I wanted to do it and I could have done it, but every precaution and warning\
  \ we received for blood exposure was racing through my mind right then. It was hard\
  \ to tell in the darkness but there was a lot of blood. \n\t\u201CTell them to turn\
  \ him on his side!\u201D I shouted to the front of the van. Our driver and local\
  \ representative would translate for me; he could understand me as long as he could\
  \ hear me. The small cargo van made lots of noise under the stress of the unpaved\
  \ road and the heavy load; we were now ten people in the cargo van including all\
  \ of our luggage outside on the roof. The injured boy was turned soon after and\
  \ the gurgling noise he had been making soon turned into a cough. A dark liquid\
  \ came spurting out of his mouth; I knew it was blood, but in the glow of a few\
  \ cell phone flashlights it was black. One of the passengers looked up at me in\
  \ panic after seeing the blood and I nodded to him, hoping it would give him some\
  \ reassurance.\n\tI kept my eyes on the rising and falling of the boy\u2019s chest\
  \ and wondered to myself where we were. My phone showed that it was almost midnight,\
  \ which meant my parents were only just now sitting down for dinner back home in\
  \ Canada. \n\nWhen my flight had landed in Malawi just after noon that day, we had\
  \ been hoisted into this old burgundy van and had since been heading north. We were\
  \ a group of five young and eager medical volunteers, all from different countries\
  \ and all ready for a new adventure. As someone who often gets car sick, I was fairing\
  \ quite well facing sideways on my makeshift bench. I had watched the sun disappear\
  \ from the back window and eventually the exhaustion of travelling overcame me.\
  \ \n\tI heard the screaming before I opened my eyes. We had stopped and I was blinking\
  \ away the grogginess when I was ordered to stay in the van with the others. One\
  \ by one we regained our bearings and each peered out from the side window to make\
  \ sense of what was happening. With minimal light, we could just make out someone\
  \ lying on the opposite side of the road, surrounded by a small group of people\
  \ including our driver. Within minutes the five of us were cramming into the back\
  \ as we watched the small group of men carry the boy by his arms and legs, to the\
  \ van. It was too late to advise them on how to carry him as they rushed him to\
  \ the open seat and all sat with him sprawled across their laps. A hit and run,\
  \ our driver explained to us. A truck hit this teenage boy as he was walking on\
  \ the side of an unlit road\u2014because all the roads here were unlit\u2014and\
  \ it had driven off and left him.\n\n\tHis breathing had gotten shallower as we\
  \ reached the hospital and attendants came rushing out with a gurney. They placed\
  \ him onto it and handled his body a bit more carefully than before and we watched\
  \ as they brought him inside. I wish knew whether he survived or not but I never\
  \ saw him again. That first night did not reflect the next four months of my volunteer\
  \ placement in my small medical clinic however it did introduce me to the conditions\
  \ of my new reality."
