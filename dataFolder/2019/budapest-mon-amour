Text: "When you're twenty and someone buys you a plane ticket for your birthday, your\
  \ mind is already too busy making a list of things to pack to ask questions about\
  \ the destination.\nSo all of a sudden in my hands I had a ticket to Budapest, Hungary,\
  \ and I have to admit I had to google the exact location. Full disclosure, for me\
  \ before that travel the eastern Europe was just a giant confusing area, and I never\
  \ paid much interest to any of those countries. Shame on me!\nThat is the reason\
  \ why I didn't expect to find a city to fall in love with.\nI was fascinated by\
  \ their history, their culture, their food. Everything I always hope to find in\
  \ a new journey, all found in one city. If you've been there, you definitely know\
  \ what I'm talking about, and if not, please, do yourself a favour and book a flight\
  \ to Budapest as soon as you can.\nI loved to walk along the Danube, to cross all\
  \ those amazing bridges, to cycle on Margaret Island, to explore the sumptuous Parliament\
  \ and the old city of Buda, with the castle and the breath taking view over the\
  \ entire city along the river.\nI didn't know much about their past involving the\
  \ Nazi persecutions, so stepping into the Jewish district and visiting the Synagogue\
  \ gave me goose bumps, literally.\nAlso, I had plenty of time to enjoy the lively\
  \ side of the city. Special mention for the ruin pubs, this magical district where\
  \ pubs are literally set in alleys and narrow streets in between buildings, but\
  \ my biggest shout out goes to the beef goulash (guly\xE1s) and the chimney cake\
  \ (K\xFCrt\u0151skal\xE1cs). For all the vegetarians and vegans out there, sorry,\
  \ but goulash is too good to resist the temptation.\nJust travelling on the public\
  \ transport might take you to unexpected places. The underground in Budapest is\
  \ the second oldest in Europe after London, and some of the stations are simply\
  \ amazing. You can almost breath the late XIX century vibes.\nI left a big piece\
  \ of my heart in this beautiful city, and the promise that I'll be back for new\
  \ adventures and new things to explore. Budapest caught me completely off guard\
  \ but as they say, the best things happen when you least expect it."
