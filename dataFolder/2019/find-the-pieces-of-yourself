Text: "Luggage, documents, airport queue, almost 4 hours flight and I was there. I\
  \ arrived in Scotland- a country wrapped in fog and mysteries. Stepping off the\
  \ plane left me speechless. I dreamt of moving to Scotland for months, spending\
  \ hours looking at pictures and reading endless articles for myths and truths about\
  \ the country. However, everything looked fake. The pictures in Google can`t give\
  \ you the feeling of breathing the fresh and cold Scottish air or hearing the annoying\
  \ sound of the seagulls, which I discovered later.  \nSo, this was it -  the Granite\
  \ City. The tall buildings, the wide roads, the cars wandering in this grey labyrinth\
  \ and the gulls descending steadily from the high heights, turned Aberdeen into\
  \ a place I would like to escape for a while, but it was actually my new home. For\
  \ a moment I could imagine my little student room as a tiny room in a cheap hotel.\
  \ In this scenario, I, awakened by the deafening screams of my feathered friends,\
  \ would go out in the cool morning, looking for a cosy caf\xE9 in which to warm\
  \ up with a cup of fragrant coffee before getting lost for hours among the small\
  \ streets, discovering the secrets of this charming town. Everything was new and\
  \ surprising- from the smiling Scottish grandmas to the buildings that are like\
  \ from a Disney cartoon. I found myself captivated by everything. I`ve always imagined\
  \ to move to another city or another country and to become my better self. To live\
  \ somewhere where no-one knows me and where I will be free. Something like that\
  \ is just an illusion. Day by day, month after a month I`ve settled more and more\
  \ and soon I realised that no matter how attractive are the old castle and the double-decker\
  \ bus, they cannot make a different person from me. They can just show me another\
  \ perspective. I was born in a different time, raised in a different country but\
  \ every place I`ve been to leave its mark on me. People don't find their perfect\
  \ place where they feel the most comfortable. They should travel and experience\
  \ different things. Because same as the seagulls which I hated at the beginning,\
  \ we are free spirits and find a piece of ourselves in every place to which we go.\
  \ \n\nAssemble your puzzle and travel as much as possible!"
