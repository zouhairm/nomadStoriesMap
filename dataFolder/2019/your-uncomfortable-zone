Text: "It was 2am that we arrived at our hostel. This was our first time. Our hostel\
  \ cherry was about to be popped.\n \nWe didn\u2019t know what to expect when we\
  \ arrived as you hear all these stories about hostels,  people having sex, next\
  \ to you, below you or on top of you whilst you tried to sleep but also, that they\
  \ were great places to be meeting all different types of people and make friends\
  \ for life. We were only staying one night, I doubted that would happen but really,\
  \ we thought it would be a fun and memorable experience. It was not fun, but it\
  \ was certainly memorable in fact, I think we may have hostelled wrong. It may have\
  \ been because we are not interesting people with wise words, amazing stories about\
  \ getting lost in the Bermuda triangle and being the only people to survive a visit\
  \ a unknown tribe in the depths of the rainforest in some country no one has heard\
  \ of! We have never done these things and I\u2019d imagine that it was obvious to\
  \ everyone around us, a certain newbie stink to us. \n\nWe checked in and managed\
  \ to find our room. It was pitch black inside and Chris just ended up crashing into\
  \ the room, through a gap that was barely wider than he was, banging the bunkbeds\
  \ with the massive backpack he had not yet grown accustomed to. We stood straining\
  \ our eyes to find the two free beds out of the 10 in the room and we eventually\
  \ saw that a top bunk was free which Chris took as I really didn\u2019t want to\
  \ squeeze up the little ladder from fear of toppling it. There was also a bed with\
  \ a sheet hanging over it, it looked like the only free one, so I ended up in there,\
  \ in bed with a pizza. The pizza told me that this was not an available bed after\
  \ all, and I needed to move before the occupant came back! She did at some point\
  \ in the night and I would not have like to have ended up in bed with her! My eyes\
  \ eventually adjusted to the darkness and I could see that there was another one\
  \ free which I hunkered down in to just try to make it through the night.\nThe night\
  \ in the hostel was long, uncomfortable and I truly hated it. I wanted to leave\
  \ but I couldn\u2019t communicate to Chris in any way though I did try telepathically\
  \ but that obviously didn\u2019t work. Perhaps if we were there longer or had arrived\
  \ during the day it may not have seemed like we had been dropped straight into a\
  \ bazaar dream into an alternate reality. At least we have determined that we are\
  \ not hostel people and quickly cancelled the one for our last night.\n\nAfter a\
  \ long night, it was finally time to leave. Daylight filtered through the cloth\
  \ that barely covered the tiny window and we could see how rammed the bunkbeds were,\
  \ pressed up against each other so we were almost sharing! Stuff littered the floor,\
  \ wires, phones, clothes and bags, the stuff that Chris had kicked when he stomped\
  \ his way through.\n\nIt was now time to really start our trip and we had a van\
  \ to collect. We became snails with our home on our backs free to explore! We decided\
  \ to head further north and on our merry way we had a lot of hitch hikers looking\
  \ at us, hoping we would stop but we didn\u2019t have the space and I always thought\
  \ of the different people we could have met, the stories we could have heard and\
  \ shared, the knife that could have been pulled on us and the shovel that dug our\
  \ shallow graves, you see, all those good times we missed out on. \n\nA short way\
  \ up the coast we arrived at a little piece of paradise called Uretitti beach. This\
  \ was a start to our month adventure in New Zealand. I had never done anything like\
  \ this before and here I was taking a leap into the unknown, which turned out to\
  \ be the best month of my life."
