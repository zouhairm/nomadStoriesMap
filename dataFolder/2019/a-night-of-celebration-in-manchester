Text: "It was the ninth night of \u201CNavratri\u201D (Nine Nights). I was blissed\
  \ out completely and celebrating wildly, such as I\u2019d never done before. Strangely\
  \ enough, the celebration was nowhere close to a Hindu temple or community and did\
  \ not involve any of the traditional rites or scriptural chants. I was at a gig\
  \ at a folk music festival in Manchester, England, having been dragged there on\
  \ a spur of the moment decision by my friend, Izzi. \n\nWhen I had opened my eyes\
  \ to a cold, bright autumn morning in Leeds that day, I had had no plans of being\
  \ in Manchester at all till I got a text message from my friend saying that we\u2019\
  d be going to Manchester for a gig. I had never heard the names of any of the performing\
  \ artists before, I had never even paid much attention to English folk music for\
  \ that matter but none of that seemed remotely relevant as I jumped at the opportunity\
  \ of trying something new and hopefully, exciting. \n\nI still walked the one and\
  \ a half miles to the Leeds Hindu temple that morning to take part in the \u201C\
  Pushpanjali\u201D (offering of flowers). I have never been a religious person but\
  \ I would religiously go to the temple during the festival during my time at Leeds.\
  \ The cold English weather can bring with it a chilling loneliness as well and time\
  \ spent at the temple was an effective means of combating the same.  Despite being\
  \ a complete stranger in the gathering, I felt welcomed there and a part of a community,\
  \ a part of something bigger than me and that is why perhaps I was there all nine\
  \ days to celebrate the mythical triumph of a goddess over a demon. The rituals\
  \ performed at the temple offered a brief reprieve to the weary traveler in me,\
  \ reminding me of the familiar sights encountered at home. The drumbeats echoed\
  \ the sounds of my childhood, the women dancing reminding me of the family and friends\
  \ back in \u201CBharat\u201D (India) who would be celebrating in a similar fashion,\
  \ the smell of the oil lamps and fragrant flowers transporting me to early morning\
  \ offerings I partook in during the festival as a child. \n\nAfter the morning at\
  \ the temple, Izzi and I boarded a bus to Manchester in late afternoon, managing\
  \ to reach Manchester just on time for the second performance of the evening, Beans\
  \ on Toast. Now my taste in music is pretty different from what I heard that evening\
  \ but I enjoyed it a great deal with loads of enthusiasm. I mean how can you not\
  \ love a song about the chicken farming industry and one on how trees are being\
  \ cut to benefit big corporations who are ruining the earth?! The energy in the\
  \ room was so vibrant and electric, extremely different from the one I experienced\
  \ in the morning, yet connecting me with a room full of strangers, united by their\
  \ love for music. And as I jumped and danced along to the folk and indie tunes Skinny\
  \ Lister spun out, I felt a sense of belonging to a community of people, none of\
  \ whom I knew individually, the sense of being part of something greater than myself,\
  \ experiencing music of a wholly different place and culture that still resonated\
  \ with this small town girl from India. \n\nAround eleven, as Will Varley gently\
  \ crooned \u201CTo build a wall\u201D, Izzi and I left the gig to catch the last\
  \ train back to Leeds. Even at night, the city was bursting with life. Hordes of\
  \ Mancunians took to the streets, drinking, partying, celebrating. I\u2019d been\
  \ to Manchester before, learned of its great industrial history, walked on a bright\
  \ summer\u2019s day to Old Trafford stadium to buy souvenirs for friends who were\
  \ football enthusiasts, abused the city for the incessant rain that never stopped\
  \ but I had never expected to find in Manchester a parallel to my own culture. People\
  \ and cultures, despite appearances, are really the same everywhere. We are all\
  \ here seeking connections and harboring the desire to be a part of something greater\
  \ than ourselves."
