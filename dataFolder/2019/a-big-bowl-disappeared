Text: "The black Pearl almost slipped on a muddy hair-pin bend approaching a small\
  \ lake in the Himalayas at the altitude of 2730 meters. It had started drizzling\
  \ and I had to be gentle on the throttle of this machine that I named \u201CPearl\u201D\
  , my 10 years and 55000 Kms old, 224CC Honda motorcycle. Just 24 hours before this\
  \ evening, I was cruising this thing on a straight road in the Gangetic plains decorated\
  \ by yellow mustard fields. It was not my first encounter to the mountains, but\
  \ I had never been at one in the winters.  \n200 meters ahead from that bend, the\
  \ pearl gave up into a patch of deep and thick mud disabling friction and making\
  \ rear wheel move freely. I couldn\u2019t move that heavy thing an inch, only my\
  \ feet sunk in 6 inches too. Phhffff, with a deep breadth I turned my back on Black\
  \ Pearl and was almost surprised by the scene that greeted me \u2013deep slopes\
  \ covered by mist, with some clouds like a floating blot coming almost up to my\
  \ face. This all would have been missed in focusing on road curves if I had not\
  \ been stuck here. It was only 2 hours to get dark, the last village was 15 Kms\
  \ behind, even walking back won\u2019t help. I was foolish enough to not bring any\
  \ sleeping bag or tent, oh what did I know? It was my first solo journey! And, that\u2019\
  s when I heard the familiar whirr of a bike. Coming up the hills were two men, whom\
  \ I passed an hour before when they were smoking joints, together we pulled both\
  \ the bikes beyond the mud patch. \nThe scene ahead was worth the risks we had taken\
  \ \u2013 just as I was walking in the sight of earth snuggling to sleep beneath\
  \ a soft, white blanket \u2013 I saw tiny cotton pearls flying down. This was my\
  \ first snowfall. Enough to spur me on \u2013 who cares if I get stuck in the middle\
  \ of all this? Yes, I had been warned of \u2018bad\u2019 weather and no place to\
  \ stay on this mountain by nearly everyone whom I had asked for direction on my\
  \ way. While in rest of the country, \u2018bad\u2019 weather means that you will\
  \ return home drenched to the bone. In the Himalayas, where I was, this means that\
  \ you will be buried in a sudden snowstorm on your way or if you are lucky, you\
  \ will be indoors while the snow falls, and will be only stranded. \nTogether, with\
  \ my newfound friends, I led the way for some minutes only to find that we are lost.\
  \ We hopelessly looked over some abandoned huts, not good enough to keep us warm\
  \ for the whole night and stopped our bikes. After climbing up a hill with our helmets\
  \ on, there was seen one house on the slope, and we turned back our bikes. 500 meters\
  \ back, we saw the sign board which we missed due to snow. The place was a \u2018\
  closed for the season\u2019 guesthouse and we somehow convinced the guard to let\
  \ us share his room. Our host prepared great food and we shared our life stories\
  \ around fire, it was snowing outside which if continued for the whole night would\
  \ bury the road 2 ft under and make it impossible to ride for a week or two.  We\
  \ snuggled under 12 blankets in an undersized tent and slept, what must be the most\
  \ peaceful sleeps we had had for a long time.\nI woke up to the most spectacular\
  \ morning of my life. Black Pearl was now covered in a white blanket and glowed\
  \ in the rose-tinted rays of the sun. The three of us trekked to the lake, I climbed\
  \ to a hill for a better view and felt it slowly disappearing from my heart, \u201C\
  the fear of unknown\u201D. The inspiration to this winter trip was a photo on internet\
  \ which invited me to what looked like a big bowl of water surrounded by white walls,\
  \ with a small island in the middle. I had heard earlier that the locals believe\
  \ this island changes positions. Well, I had to find out."
