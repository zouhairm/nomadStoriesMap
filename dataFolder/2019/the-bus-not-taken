Text: "One certainty about life is making choices. You must make a choice in everything\
  \ you do in life to the extent that not choosing is also a choice. I was faced with\
  \ such a moment of decision sometimes in February 2016 when I was on my way to my\
  \ hometown for my Mum's burial. I had to travel with my Elder Sister and it was\
  \ such a stressful journey because of the various encounters we had on the way.\
  \ The journey was an impromptu one because we had never decided to travel on that\
  \ day but we had to as the situation got changed. We eventually embarked on a journey\
  \ with an uncertain outcome since it was unprepared. \n\nThe journey from Lagos\
  \ to my hometown is about 7 hours in total and we had to board a bus from the park.\
  \ Before we took off, we encountered a serious fight between our driver and one\
  \ of the hawkers in the park. There was some sort of financial misunderstanding\
  \ which escalated into a fight and caused some damages including the breaking of\
  \ a rear window in our bus. We initially saw it as a bad omen but had to stay on\
  \ in the vehicle since we had paid. Getting a nice bus for a journey is not something\
  \ easy as you will have to go around the park until you meet the bus company of\
  \ your satisfaction. We had seen a bus of our choice and wanted to board but we\
  \ kept on searching for a better one. There was limited time and we had seen another\
  \ one but we were not sure about it. We could not search anymore. We had to make\
  \ a choice, we took a leap into an unknown. Although the vehicle looked road worthy\
  \ but the driver was the only person who knew the exact state of the vehicle. We\
  \ gave it a chance and the journey started.\n\nOur first bus broke down after about\
  \ 45 minutes of the journey. We had to wait for the company to send us another bus.\
  \ After about 50 minutes, the second bus arrived to our stranded point and we commenced\
  \ the journey. The second bus developed a fault and had a break failure. At this\
  \ point, everyone in the bus was furious about the ugly situation and the incompetence\
  \ of the motor company servicing our journey. However, I did not know how to combine\
  \ the anger of our current situation with the sorrow and sadness of loosing my only\
  \ surviving parent. We had to stop at a major bus stop after the incidence of the\
  \ second bus. Many of our fellow passengers were already asking for a refund and\
  \ some of us were eager to get unto a better vehicle so as to get to our destinations.\
  \ \n\nAlas, we left the confused driver with his broken vehicle as we hurriedly\
  \ looked for another vehicle to complete our journey even though we could not wait\
  \ for a refund. We got unto another car and paid almost the exact fare we had paid\
  \ at the beginning of the journey because the sun was already going down and it\
  \ was a perfect opportunity for motorists to inflate their prices. Albeit from this\
  \ point, the journey seemed to be normal without disrupts but it was not what we\
  \ had bargained for at the beginning. We had to enter another car when we had got\
  \ down from the last one and then we finished up the journey with a motorcycle because\
  \ it was late at night. This journey was never planned in the first place. It was\
  \ a risky one but we had to take the chance. We would have turned back after the\
  \ first and second incident but we decided to complete the journey as we never expected\
  \ that things would turn out the way they did. When we got to our destination, we\
  \ remembered the other bus which we did not take eventually, the bus not taken.\
  \ You would not blame us. We had a burial to plan and attend to. We had to make\
  \ a choice therefore we took a leap, a leap into the unknown."
