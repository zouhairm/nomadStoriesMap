Text: "I didn't expect to find myself in Israel (no I am not Jewish and no (unfortunately)\
  \ it was not a birthright trip). It was, however, a ten day trip with someone whom\
  \ I had shared a life with for ~2.5 years, a trip that ended our partnership on\
  \ what was otherwise supposed to be a time filled with cultural exploration and\
  \ mutual love for the unknown. Instead, ten days spent apart in the same city halfway\
  \ across the world (Tel Aviv) initially left me speechless and devastated, but somehow\
  \ transformed into something poetic (sorry to sound trite but please hear me out).\
  \ Everything was suddenly new, even beyond just being in a new country in a new\
  \ region of the world. I had a choice; either be miserable or accept what was real\
  \ and take advantage of my time and space. \n\nAnd so I did just that. \n\nEvery\
  \ day I spent doing something I had originally planned for two people and progressively\
  \ I remembered why I ever started to travel to begin with. I floated in the Mediterranean,\
  \ played paddle ball with Israeli's, perused the vibrant antique shops in Jaffa,\
  \ explored the proverbial nightlife in Tel Aviv (and yes, I danced my face off)\
  \ and I dined like a king at some of the best falafel shops I have ever eaten at\
  \ (no joke). I knew these opportunities would go amiss and I'd deeply regret not\
  \ taking advantage of everything in a country that I may never get the chance to\
  \ visit again, and so I had to force myself out of my comfort zone to be at peace\
  \ with my decision. \n\nNo denying though, it was not as easy as I am painting it\
  \ out to be (I mean, we were still sharing an Airbnb). I cried a lot and I didn't\
  \ do a whole lot to stop it. I I let myself fully feel the gravity and the weight\
  \ of the bitter, tail-end of a hard-fought relationship and it took patience, courage,\
  \ and chutzpah to simultaneously take space for myself and take advantage of the\
  \ city I so desperately wanted to become familiar with. I journaled every day, I\
  \ meditated on the beach at sunset, I took long walks and sat at cafe's staring\
  \ at the passersby, I did everything I could to see the city through the lens of\
  \ a local while allowing myself to grasp what was transpiring behind the scenes.\
  \ Hell, I even laughed! I laughed until it got dark and then I felt the lowest of\
  \ lows and the loneliest I had ever felt. I walked through narrow streets late at\
  \ night with crowds of beautiful people dancing, embracing each other, walking hand\
  \ in hand and smiling harder than I thought I had ever seen. The happiness and vibrancy\
  \ of the city was amplified yet distant in those moments, and I felt the sharp,\
  \ stinging sensation that could only translate to 'you don't belong here.' Yet,\
  \ despite the deep pain I felt I also learned the most about myself in those quiet\
  \ moments by fully embracing the utterly solitary position I was in. I never asked\
  \ for it, I didn't want it, but I didn't have a choice and so I let it be. \n\n\
  You know, they (who are they, by the way?) always say there's never a good time\
  \ for a break up - I wholeheartedly believe that to be true. That said, looking\
  \ back almost a year later I feel gratitude and peace for the way everything played\
  \ out. I look back on this particular travel story as a pivotal moment in my life\
  \ where I made a decision to put myself first and work through my discomfort to\
  \ reignite my explorative side. I fell in love with Tel Aviv and all of its cultural\
  \ offerings, and by proxy I fell in love with myself again. My trip to Israel helped\
  \ me find myself in a way that I had never anticipated or could have ever thought\
  \ would have played out - how could I have ever known?"
