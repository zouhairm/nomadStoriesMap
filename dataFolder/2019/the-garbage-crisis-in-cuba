Text: "The warm water, palm trees and crystal-white sand of the Santa Maria beach\
  \ in Cuba were everything I had pictured when I first learned I was accepted on\
  \ a two-week study abroad trip to the picturesque island. It didn\u2019t disappoint\
  \ in natural beauty\u2014but the ever-present evidence of human waste and unbridled\
  \ poverty cracked my rosy tourist view wide open, and helped me see the real Cuba:\
  \ \nCuba is a very different picture than travel agencies sell to Americans. The\
  \ beaches do glitter with the promised tropical, soft white sand, but they\u2019\
  re also littered with garbage. Beer and soda cans bob on the balmy waves as local\
  \ Cubans drink and party in the water. Children play with glass bottles like toy\
  \ boats in the surf and candy wrappers and diapers erupt from the ground like sandcastles.\
  \ \nBeaches aren\u2019t the only thing impacted by waste. Litter lines the concrete\
  \ Malecon, the seawall that separates the city from the ocean. Potholes on the sidewalks\
  \ of the city function like makeshift garbage receptacles and soda cans cap the\
  \ ends of tree branches that shade the sidewalks. In rural towns outside of Havana,\
  \ trash propagates almost abundantly as vegetation. \nCuba is impoverished, but\
  \ one could argue that poverty does not justify squalor. I used to believe that\
  \ Cuban\u2019s attitude toward managing their waste spoke volumes about the way\
  \ they view themselves, their culture and their leaders. In a Communist country\
  \ where food is rationed and property is owned by the government, I thought littering\
  \ could be interpreted as a subtle act of defiance, a way to regain control of their\
  \ autonomy.\nI realize now that it\u2019s not necessarily that people don\u2019\
  t care, they simply don\u2019t enough resources to keep it clean. In an article\
  \ published in March 2017 in the Havana Times, Jimmy Roque Martinez writes about\
  \ the \u201Chygiene crisis\u201D in the Ampliacion del Sevillano neighborhood:\t\
  \n\u201CThere aren\u2019t any garbage containers in this neighborhood. In some places,\
  \ plastic bags full of  waste are placed outside houses until a horse-drawn carriage\
  \ comes to pick them up, normally every other day.\u201D \n\u201CThe horse carts\
  \ can\u2019t pass through other areas which go deeper into the neighborhood, and\
  \ so many neighbors, like 65 year old Saldivar, have to walk 10 blocks to throw\
  \ away garbage from their house, to a dump right on the street.\u201D\nStill, the\
  \ Cuban government blames them for the squalor.\nWhile Cuba is advertised as a tourist\u2019\
  s paradise, the residents of the city know a different Cuba. A paradox exists, symbolically\
  \ portrayed by Cuba\u2019s picturesque landscape, marred by the ugly aftermath of\
  \ corruption and control.\nSome say that Cuba debatably progressed in numerous ways\
  \ under Fidel Castro, but many residents don\u2019t agree. There are many things\
  \ about the culture make travelers like myself, who are used to more resources uncomfortable.\
  \ However, when we realize that the true Cuba doesn\u2019t match the Cuba of our\
  \ dreams, we can simply leave and choose not to see the ugly truth lurking just\
  \ below the surface, but the Cuban people aren\u2019t so lucky.\nThey will wake\
  \ up tomorrow and the candy wrappers, used condoms and beer bottles will still be\
  \ there. They will have to keep adding and adding to the piles until the government\
  \ finally does something about it, because despite the number of formal complaints\
  \ or news reports on Cuban TV addressing the issue, nobody\u2019s organizing any\
  \ beach cleanups anytime soon."
