Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find my husband in the shower with another man when\
  \ I came home from work early one night. But in hindsight, I\u2019m glad I did.\
  \ Because if I hadn\u2019t, I never would have had the courage to leave something\
  \ that wasn\u2019t good for me, or, to start something that was. So I left, I took\
  \ a leap of faith and perused my dreams of being a travel filmmaker and now I\u2019\
  m here, sitting in the back of a taxi in India, with dust blowing over my face,\
  \ the sounds of beeping trucks and the stares from locals wondering what exactly\
  \ this white girl is doing alone in the northern suburbs of Manali, driving over\
  \ some bumpy roads and I\u2019ll admit, feeling pretty ready to be car sick, but\
  \ I kinda secretly love it and wouldn\u2019t want anything any other way. Because\
  \ I\u2019m here. Where I\u2019ve been needing to be for the last 7 years. I used\
  \ to travel to escape or to \u201Cfind myself\u201D but I\u2019ve learnt, no matter\
  \ how far you run or where you go, there YOU are. It\u2019s still you, you\u2019\
  re still there and so are your problems. You have to travel from within. A place\
  \ can help you do that but it\u2019s often the interactions in that place. The talk\
  \ with a stranger you didn\u2019t expect to pull up a chair beside you at lunch,\
  \ the children running after your camera asking \u201Cpicture, picture\u201D and\
  \ then them thanking you for making them so happy or the blessings you count when\
  \ you see the bones protruding from a shirtless man and you realise how insignificant\
  \ your problems are. The truth is, LIFE. IS. SIMPLE. So why do we complicate it?\
  \ Sure, bad shit can happen, I could write a novel about my past and all it would\
  \ do is depress people as well as myself, but, if I really want to connect, I have\
  \ to write about NOW. Right now. This moment, this taxi ride, these people, this\
  \ feeling. That\u2019s how you touch people, by making them forget where they are\
  \ and create a world of magic through your eyes and experiences and share it as\
  \ the gift that it is. Making people happy, making yourself happy, that\u2019s what\
  \ it\u2019s all about. This trip, this solo trip, I started in Philippines and it\u2019\
  s amazed me how many people both there and here in India keep asking \u201Cyou\u2019\
  re alone?\u201D \u201CJust you?\u201D \u201CSingle?\u201D \u201COnly one\u201D \u201C\
  where\u2019s your boyfriend, where\u2019s your husband?\u201D Yes. I am alone. Because\
  \ I fucking chose to be. But that does not mean I\u2019m lonely. I chose a life\
  \ of happiness for myself, even if that means two years of uncomfortable growing\
  \ pains vs a lifetime of stagnant familiarity. I chose happiness. I chose to see\
  \ the world and for the world to see me.  There\u2019s a lot I have seen that I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect and there\u2019s so much to still learn that I don\u2019t know,\
  \ but all I can say with certainty is the world is filled with beauty and so am\
  \ I being in it. India is filled with a symmetry of yin and yang, for every sadness\
  \ there is happiness and it\u2019s beauty is surely balanced with its ugliness,\
  \ the same goes for every one of us. All I can aim to do, is strive for more than\
  \ yesterday, rise and fall with an open heart and accept every experience for what\
  \ it is - a subconscious manifestation of who I am becoming."
