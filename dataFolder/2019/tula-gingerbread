Text: "Singapore is a stable city. People work, pay taxes and realize that no matter\
  \ what, they will strive to live the life they desire with passion and enthusiasm.\
  \ Only the screwy weather spoiled the overall picture: I was caught outside in a\
  \ sudden rain shower. Having run into the first open store, I noticed my iPhone\
  \ was missing. Apparently, it had fallen out of my pocket while I was running. \n\
  \              Borrowing the mobile phone from a shopkeeper, I dialed my number.\
  \ The man who found it was Vladimir and he gave me the address where I could pick\
  \ my iPhone up.\n              As I stepped over the threshold, I met a man of about\
  \ forty who was wearing a suit, shirt, and tie. All employees of the financial sector\
  \ dress like this. I tried to give him money but he politely refused and asked me\
  \ just to drink tea with him.\n              Vladimir made a cup of tea apologizing\
  \ in passing for the mess in the apartment. Looking around the mountain of dirty\
  \ dishes, I understood a man who lives alone. Suddenly, out of nowhere, he brought\
  \ out Tula gingerbread to my surprise. Where did the Russian gingerbread come from\
  \ in this far southeastern country? My new friend sat down and told his story.\n\
  \             He moved to Donetsk to Ukraine to be with his beloved girl twelve\
  \ years ago. A daughter was born; they acquired a large apartment in the center\
  \ of the city.\n            - Nobody lives there for the time being. When the war\
  \ began, I did not listen to my friends who advised to sell the property and leave.\
  \ Something bad was going to happen but I did not feel it in my bones. I heard about\
  \ the war only from my grandmother and had no idea of what it was.\n           \
  \ Baby clothes, ironed Vladimir\u2019s shirts, are still hanging in the wardrobe\
  \ of their apartment. They had to flee when the war in Donbass started. His wife\
  \ and daughter live with their parents in Moscow and still do not have the right\
  \ to leave \u2013 their documents are confiscated. His Russian nationality helped\
  \ Vladimir. \n            They cannot go home. Their homeland is no more - Donetsk\
  \ has become an independent republic of the DPR, which status has not yet been recognized\
  \ even by Russia. War is still going on. His family has the status of refugees:\
  \ they are not loved in Russia. They are not loved anywhere. Being a refugee is\
  \ scary because you are running into uncertainty from death and destruction, you\
  \ shove your whole life into your bag not knowing what you will come to and whether\
  \ it will return.\n            Vladimir did not see his daughter for more than six\
  \ months. Trying to be back on his feet, he came to Singapore under a contract.\
  \ He has to work so hard to send money to his family. In a year\u2019s time, he\
  \ will be able to earn as much as he would have earned working twenty years in Donetsk\
  \ under the current military conditions. His last memory of his daughter there was\
  \ of her crawling on the floor, hiding under a chair and waiting for it all to be\
  \ over with a cry of \u201CDaddy save me.\u201D Little Lily and her family lived\
  \ in the basement without light and water, each time being startled from the explosions\
  \ above. He could not explain to his daughter, who inquiringly looked at him with\
  \ her button-eyes, why she had to live here. He could not explain to her that war\
  \ stole her childhood. \n            Barely holding back tears, I dip Tula gingerbread\
  \ into freshly brewed tea. That night, most of their relatives died during the bombing.\
  \ Vladimir and his girls miraculously survived. \n            I walk down the street\
  \ after the February rain and photograph people on the phone, which was saved by\
  \ my new friend. Singaporeans are carefree and happy. Only the packaging of donated\
  \ Tula gingerbread, rustling in my bag, reminds me that somewhere at the other end\
  \ of the globe the war continues."
