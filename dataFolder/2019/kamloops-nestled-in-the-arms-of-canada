Text: "For an Edmonton local like myself, British Columbia was that \"next door but\
  \ still rather far away\" province, new and unfound territory, known only through\
  \ the various high-school lessons about how many mountains and old railways it holds.\
  \ But I never imagined that, among the wilderness of the mountains and the forests,\
  \ great traces of Canada's pioneer spirit created a lively human presence, at once\
  \ familiar, but also standing proudly among the nature of B.C. \n\nIntrigued by\
  \ how close it was on a map, but still so far away in spirit, I decided, when I\
  \ finally became a new driver - fresh licence in my wallet, new car pedal under\
  \ my heels - that I would have to discover it for myself. The plan was to travel\
  \ from Edmonton to Vancouver and back, taking in the natural splendour all around.\
  \ Little did I know that Kamloops, a place I could easily find on a map, carried\
  \ a merging of humanity and the sublime that makes a drive through the Canadian\
  \ mountains an experience to remember. \n\nOriginally, Kamloops was established\
  \ as a collection of old trading posts and forts. Because of its access to strong\
  \ river waters and wide open spaces, it became a popular place for many colonists,\
  \ eventually uniting them under the banner of Kamloops. But as it grew, the reality\
  \ of its climate became clear. Nestled in between mountains on all sides around\
  \ the low river valleys, most clouds rain before entering the area, making the land\
  \ semi-arid. \n\nIt's a weather phenomena that becomes plain to the eye when driving\
  \ around the valley, but it sure leaves its mark. Down winding highways built into\
  \ the foothills of surrounding mountains, the driver gets a spinning perspective\
  \ on wide open fields of golden grass and soil. The valley shows off its rich brown\
  \ shades of the land, illuminating highlights of yellow among the strong and ever-present\
  \ green grasses. All these flatlands, making a great base for the homes of the locals,\
  \ gives firm ground on which to stand and witness the height of the mountain peaks,\
  \ only occasionally looking sharp and tall over the distant view of rolling hills.\
  \ \n\nIt really is a city that has a little bit of everything for a visitor. The\
  \ wide stretches of valley create a tempting desire to jump on a bicycle, off-road\
  \ vehicle, maybe even a horse, and get a feel for the open grasslands. But every\
  \ way you look from that lower point, you can still see the mountains, offering\
  \ green hiking trails on one side, and perfect mountain-biking slopes on the other.\
  \ The city itself has a lively tourist community, with the outdoor lifestyle giving\
  \ rise to many athletic tournaments all year round. Peering over the highways, I\
  \ could still see the old railroads - mostly still in use - delivering iconic pioneer\
  \ resources of lumber and copper, as the trains ran along the many ranches that\
  \ dotted the outskirts of the city. For a prairie local like myself, knowing my\
  \ Alberta flatlands as the distinct place to find farming culture, I never expected\
  \ to see farmhouses and intrepid communities nestled in between the Rockies, though\
  \ it was a welcome sight all the same. \n\nBut a sight you genuinely can't miss\
  \ when visiting Kamloops is the city at night. Because of the way the local highways\
  \ climb the surrounding foothills, Kamloops has to be seen from a higher elevation\
  \ when first entering. In the day, this means getting an eyeful of the mountains\
  \ bearing down over the low lying city. But at night, after the sun sets and the\
  \ locals hit the lights, Kamloops takes centre stage, becoming a sea of glimmering\
  \ brilliance. Driving into Kamloops long after dark is one of the hidden gems I\
  \ would highly recommend anybody hoping to find an eye-opening experience in the\
  \ mountains. It's like the only beacon of human life in the otherwise natural majesty\
  \ of the surrounding Rocky Mountains, and after an exhaustingly long drive, a very\
  \ welcome light indeed. \n\nI once heard about how green and forested it was in\
  \ British Columbia. But I didn't expected that even the cities there, like Kamloops,\
  \ would still touch my heart with what surprises Canada has to offer."
