Text: "Cold metal seats, loud air conditioning, and light-headedness \u2014 that\u2019\
  s what I remember from my wait at the airport that December. After a year not travelling,\
  \ waking up in the middle of the night to catch the earliest (and cheapest) flight\
  \ was a chore. Meeting Kat not long after was relieving, but not much, as she suddenly\
  \ asked, \u201Chow\u2019s your reading going?\u201D Suddenly I remembered what I\
  \ forgot. I, Kat and Ratna were supposed to spend our Christmas holiday reading\
  \ 3 chapters of diving manual in order to get a beginner license. I had only done\
  \ one chapter, Kat being the most attentive had done three. She even told me bits\
  \ about how \u2018serious\u2019 this is, and how our impulsive decision right before\
  \ the break can actually get us killed. Thinking about the sea never makes me this\
  \ sick before.\n\nBali and 3 hours drive after :\nThree of us arrived at the diving\
  \ site. We talked about how this was not actually as bad as we thought, being far\
  \ north from the lively side of the island. From the lobby, a gate in the shape\
  \ of a circle direct us to a tiny pool with rows of cottages with wooden doors and\
  \ windows, and pitch roofs covered by clay tiles. Walking a bit further, we were\
  \ greeted by the grey-sanded sea. The calm, grey line on the horizon, which slowly\
  \ steeping up irregularly, drawing a silhouette of a mountain in the sky.  We checked\
  \ that we were only 40 km from the recently active volcano in Mount Agung. To complete\
  \ the danger omen, the Indonesian Climate Officials just released a warning about\
  \ the abnormally high current and waves around the island. Even the rooster would\
  \ not stop crowing and the dogs barked at night. \n\nThe first two days of the course\
  \ were written exams and pool training, which we all passed under the constantly\
  \ cloudy and rainy sky. Our prayers of having the tiniest bit of sunray on th third\
  \ day was granted, and we prepare our diving suits and equipments cheerfully. Descending\
  \ from the boat, the salty water touched my lips. The familiar heavy weight on my\
  \ shoulder and waist signalled my lungs to get ready to the odd air I am going to\
  \ inhale from my regulator. Somehow breathing air through my mouth from the cylinder\
  \ had been making me nervous the past few days and I ended up with long, loud breath\
  \ most of the time. Diving in was actually pretty unceremonial. We descended pretty\
  \ much by flapping our legs while emptying air from our buoyancy compensator vest.\
  \ Slowly and very surely. We made several stops, in 3m, 5m, and 10m depths. Then\
  \ I realised that I was so far away from the surface that there is no quitting now.\
  \ Being panicked and ascending quickly from this depth can burst my lungs, so I\
  \ might as well enjoy what\u2019s arround me. I forced my  deathly thoughts away\
  \ and started to actually look around. The sun rays are quite defined in the greenish\
  \ water. Blues, greens, and yellows started to make sense as they form coral reefs\
  \ and a group of tiny fish. They are moving in a rythmic way as if reminding me\
  \ to keep move slowly. Unlike what I thought, to float I had to actually keep moving,\
  \ either just a leg or an arm. Deeper we moved, and the more creatures I seemed\
  \ to notice. The navy blue starfish, the tiny lobster trying to hide behind a brain-like\
  \ coral, and we even saw a swimming sea turtle flapping its four arms and legs with\
  \ obvious effort. Somehow the trip was summed up nicely with seeing a jumping stingray\
  \ on our boat back to out shore. The day ended in motion sickness for three of us,\
  \ but in the end I guessed we learned our lesson. Sometimes an unplanned trip can\
  \ teach us to not give in to impulses. But it can also be a way of feeding your\
  \ soul with a deeper connection with (or against) nature."
