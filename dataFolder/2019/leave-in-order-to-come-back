Text: "I closed my eyes in a lot of pain. The heart was pounding in the chest. A flawless\
  \ endless layer of snow lay before me and an infinitely blue sky hung over him.\
  \ There was a lonely tree on the slope as a guard on the verge of sky and snow.\
  \ And nothing else. Deafening silence was around. How loud my body was breathing.\
  \ How noisy it moved. And only one question was in my head. \u201CWhat am I doing\
  \ here?\u201D\nIn response to my dumb question, I was handed a steaming mug of hot\
  \ tea. I saw a face wrapped in a bright blue scarf with large glasses instead of\
  \ eyes. How did I know that he was smiling? \n-\tDoes your heart fall in love?\n\
  Why do I know that the answer to this question is important to me?\n\nOver 6000\
  \ meters above sea level. The Marble wall stood high in the distance. The peak attracted\
  \ by its inaccessibility. People climbed. They left mothers, lovers, and children.\
  \ They went to the places where there was nothing but mountains taking with them\
  \ only equipment, tents and food. They left the summer at the very foot and went\
  \ to meet the eternal cold. Birds and animals always chase the heat, why did these\
  \ people go into the cold. What for?\n\nTransfer camp. Gradually, the joke subsided.\
  \ The silence has become stronger. The wind was blowing the edges of the tent, as\
  \ if trying to break into a small space, where a handful of people were warming\
  \ tea, trying to sleep, and someone was reading poetry and even sang \"Hope, our\
  \ earthly compass.\" Tired faces, barely lit by flashlights, smiled and fell asleep.\
  \ Only one person sat at the entrance to the tent. His face was not visible, except\
  \ the tip of a burning cigar. His silhouette was turned to the top, which disappeared\
  \ in the dark.\n\nOn the way to the top of all sounds, only the sound of your steps\
  \ remained. People followed one after another. \u201CThe main thing that the mountain\
  \ let you go\u201D that say people who respect the mountains. Snow blinded even\
  \ through glasses. Fatigue permeated the whole body. And there were only endless\
  \ snow and rocks, rocks and snow ahead, but they managed a smile.\n\nAnd then a\
  \ black strip of land. You gazed at the first flower on the road. You gave tender\
  \ look to the first stranger on your way. A phone call and most precious voice.\n\
  - Hello\n- Hello, daughter. Dad is going home.\n\nI was not there. I am one of those\
  \ who always stayed at the foot in a city surrounded by mountains. But today I went\
  \ to the mountains. The long path and the mighty back of my guide were ahead. I\
  \ was wearing a warm sweater and coat, but I was trembling as if I was naked and\
  \ defenseless like a child. The snow was crystal white, which is impossible to see\
  \ in the city even during snowfall. It scared me with its honesty. My heart was\
  \ beating desperately as if it demanding something from me. I closed my eyes.\n\n\
  - But you did not tell how there is on top?\n- I just wanted to go home. Do you\
  \ know what's important when you go to the top?\n- Reach her?\n- No. There was a\
  \ man to whom to return. Do you have someone to come back to?\n\nI did not answer.\
  \ I took another sip of hot tea. We set off. It was still cold and a long way ahead.\
  \ But my soul was warm and calm. Snow didn\u2019t scare me. I knew the answer. I\
  \ was waited for at home."
