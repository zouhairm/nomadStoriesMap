Text: "I\u2019ve never liked mountains, and it has surprised a lot of people. Beaches\
  \ have attracted me since forever. And yet why did I choose to go on a trip to Darjeeling,\
  \ India, is still a mystery to me, or rather an act of fate that I am somehow now\
  \ fathoming bit by bit. \nOur way to Darjeeling was one of a kind; it didn\u2019\
  t start quite well to tell you the truth. Undeterred, we still reached there, amidst\
  \ the mountains. I remember being freaked out by my nausea while our car journeyed\
  \ us up the mountains.  We stopped by one of those tiny tea shops built by the side\
  \ of those freakishly risky slopes. I really enjoyed that cup of tea, along with\
  \ the shared smiles of our hosts. I wondered what it was like for them after the\
  \ Sun went down and lesser cars showed up at their shop. Wouldn\u2019t it be the\
  \ quietest place on Earth? I thought about it the rest of my journey up the hill.\
  \ I genuinely forgot my nausea and fear; I was just engulfed with curiosity, and\
  \ a sense of great aloofness. \nSo, there\u2019s this spot in Darjeeling, The Tiger\
  \ Hill. When the sun rises, you can see the Mount Kangchenjunga being illuminated\
  \ by the beautiful rays of the sun showering it with a kind of orange that looks\
  \ more gold than gold itself. The idea of seeing a beautiful sunrise along with\
  \ an exquisite view of the snow covered mountain range half dipped in an orange\
  \ syrup of the sun, churns something out of your heart, and that thing is pure desire\
  \ to witness something life changing.\nSince, the Tiger Hill is located 11 kilometers\
  \ away from the city of Darjeeling, we were told to be ready at around 3 a.m. It\
  \ was pitch dark, a completely moonless sky, but thankfully cloudless as well. But\
  \ the journey to Tiger hill was horrendous. The road had pits, and at some places\
  \ it didn\u2019t feel like there was any road at all. I wasn\u2019t ready for this,\
  \ and so I was freaking out throughout the journey, and till the time we reached\
  \ I was completely exhausted with my constant anxiety churning the walls of my stomach.\n\
  So, the Sun rose, people gathered pushed and elbowed each other to get a better\
  \ view, to get a better picture, and I stood there uninterested, almost disgusted\
  \ at the futility of the entire fiasco. For me it didn\u2019t make sense to be crazy\
  \ about the sun rising from behind a mountain, it was just the same as the sun rising\
  \ from behind any other building. So, when everyone was busy clicking pictures of\
  \ the rising Sun, I stood aside in a clearer space, and I saw the muse of the mountains.\
  \ A bunch of teenage girls ready with their thermos flasks and plastic cups, chatting\
  \ with one another in a language I didn\u2019t quite understand. But I identified\
  \ one of them; she was the same girl who served us tea the other day on our way\
  \ to Darjeeling. She looked so different this time, but beautiful nonetheless. When\
  \ people dispersed after having their slice of the sunrise, these girls ran towards\
  \ them serving hot coffee with a complementary smile. Apparently Forty rupees a\
  \ cup was too expensive for everyone, but nevertheless, the tourists enjoyed their\
  \ coffee. My eyes dropped to the girl\u2019s feet, a five inch high pencil heel!\
  \ She must have climbed the mountain on foot, somehow sticking by the walls of the\
  \ mountain to give way to the cars and jeeps. Something changed inside me that I\
  \ have yet not figured out. \nMountains aren\u2019t just about Sunrises or Sunsets.\
  \ Mountains are like novels, they hold valuable priceless stories of those people\
  \ who not only adore the beauty of the mountains but also embrace the roughness\
  \ of it. That coffee she served is the best coffee I\u2019ve ever had in my entire\
  \ life. It wasn\u2019t just powdered coffee beans boiled in milk; rather, it was\
  \ her life that she served in a tiny plastic cup with the most beautiful smile ever.\
  \ I guess mountains are people too; they love to be loved, just like us humans."
