Text: "It\u2019s nine o\u2019clock on a Tuesday morning and I am hastily braiding\
  \ my hair in front of my face, teasing it until it resembles a beard.  The King\
  \ is set to visit our humble school in Moraira, a tiny coastal Spanish fishing town\
  \ made sleek with the recent onset of tourism. \n\n\u201CHurry!\u201D whispers my\
  \ tutora.  \u201CThey\u2019re coming!\u201D\n\nMoments later the King of Carnaval\
  \ and his court burst into our classroom in a riot of sound and color.  They brandish\
  \ scepters, tambourines, and bristle with nervous energy.  Our students scream with\
  \ delight and clutch at their costumes in earnest, keen to be seen complying with\
  \ the dress code of the day.  \n\nIt is a given that lessons are sacrificed in the\
  \ week leading up to Carnaval.\n\nThe King, who bears an uncanny resemblance to\
  \ my colleague Jordi, swans around the room before stopping in front of a cowering\
  \ student.  His crown glitters in the fluorescent lights.  \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019\
  s this?  It\u2019s Crazy Hair Day and I see no crazy hair here!\u201D he declares\
  \ imperiously in Spanish. \u201CFlour them!\u201D\n\nA member of his court rushes\
  \ forward and launches a fistful of flour at the non-compliant child.  Laughter\
  \ rents the air and the satisfaction of twenty-odd people who\u2019d spent their\
  \ previous evening harassing parents and friends for crazy hair ideas, is sharply\
  \ felt.  Caramelos are handed out to the obedient subjects and the King and his\
  \ court sweep from the room, eager to visit flour, candy, and drums upon another\
  \ class.\n\nThe Carnaval celebrations in C\xE1diz and Sitges are internationally\
  \ famed for their scale and grandeur but the religiously-based festival is observed\
  \ all across Spain, even in tiny coastal towns on the Costa Blanca like Moraira.\
  \  In the week before Carnaval, each day is designated a unique dress-up requirement\
  \ in order to build up excitement; those who fail to comply are punished with lashings\
  \ of flour (not to be confused with the Els Enfarinats festival held in Ibi, which\
  \ involves a more aggressive version of flour-throwing).  On the Friday the entire\
  \ school will parade through the heart of Moraira, inspiring revelry as we wind\
  \ through the streets in our costumes.\n\nThis year the theme is \u201CBoard Games.\u201D\
  \  By the looks of the human-sized dice and Uno cards that are slowly darkening\
  \ classroom corners, I doubt there is any intention of committing to anything short\
  \ of excessive.\n\nThere is something deeply satisfying about the commitment the\
  \ Spanish have for their traditions.  To someone from Canada, a North American nation\
  \ made-up of so many backgrounds and yet having no true background of its own, such\
  \ dedication seems odd.  When celebrations were held in my school, students rarely\
  \ complied with the festival rules;  those who did typically signalled to a keenness\
  \ that was unsophisticated.  As a Canadian, I struggle to relate to Canadian festivals\
  \ in an authentic way.  I welcome the opportunity to make merry but shy away from\
  \ fully committing to the other aspects of a festival, and there is no flour waiting\
  \ for me when I do so.\n\nThe result is a loss of unity, of camaraderie.  When I\
  \ see my students look at each other knowingly while toiling away with their pinturas,\
  \ I feel a sense of belonging and self-knowledge that was amiss from my own experiences\
  \ growing up in Canada. \n\nTradition and its unquestioning observance has resulted\
  \ in some immense tragedies but when tradition comes from a place of celebrating\
  \ and reinforcing a culture\u2019s identity, its compliance reinvigorates and grounds\
  \ a community.  This is who we are.  This is what we do.\n\nThe beauty of being\
  \ Canadian is that we have the freedom to reinvent ourselves.  After severing ties\
  \ with tradition, however, not many have allowed anything richly significant to\
  \ take its place, and as a result, we are disconnected.\n\nAs the classes slowly\
  \ file out in their elaborate outfits, I can\u2019t help but smile as I scan the\
  \ ranks of human-sized Uno cards, Connect Four dots, and Monopoly figures.  There\
  \ is nothing more empowering than a fully committed, excessive costume parade. \
  \ This is who we are.  This is what we do."
