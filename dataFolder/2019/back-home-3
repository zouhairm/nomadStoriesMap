Text: "The bus stopped right behind the central station. In the same avenue I used\
  \ to walk through at least once a week to have breakfast and free WiFi. \nI was\
  \ finally back in Bari. The city I lived in for seven months was ready to have me\
  \ there one more time after years. \nIt seemed to me that anything had changed.\
  \ Still the same southern Italian coffee shops and restaurants. \nEven the guy I\
  \ used to meet every morning was still in a rush to get to his work. Still the same\
  \ good smell of food coming out the block of houses. \nThe old ladies gossiping,\
  \ the loud and cheerful voices, the eccentric hand gestures of the passengers talking\
  \ to each other or on the phone, surrounded me once again. A warm smile appeared\
  \ in my face. \nThe crowded downtown, full of well known Italian fashion brands,\
  \ offers the possibility to shop while touring churches and taking pictures along\
  \ the extraordinary seafront.\nThe famous Saint Nicholas cathedral located in the\
  \ old side of the town is easily reachable from the many narrow streets that we\
  \ all have in mind when we imagine a vacation in Italy. It was in one of those streets\
  \ where I tasted for the first time the local and tasty \u2018focaccia\u2019, a\
  \ flat oven-baked bread with tomatoes. The baker was singing his favorite Italian\
  \ song while giving small slices of focaccia for free to the tourists. \nWhat I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect was about to happen as soon as I step in my favorite ice cream\
  \ shop. \u2018Mamma mia, welcome back!\u2019 the owner exclaimed, walking towards\
  \ me. He did recognized me. He remembered me going every Monday asking for their\
  \ special dark chocolate ice cream flavor. It seemed to me I never left that place."
