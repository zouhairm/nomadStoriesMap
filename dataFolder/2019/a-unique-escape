Text: "\u2018I know it\u2019s difficult for you to make it. Try your best though!\
  \ I\u2019m telling you again, you MUST attend a Coorgi wedding at least once in\
  \ your life!\u2019\nWith that she went offline. My Coorgi friend, Donna, was finally\
  \ getting married after many years of her narration about her beautiful place and\
  \ their unique wedding rituals. \n\nCoorg is a small district in the southern Indian\
  \ state of Karnataka. During all the years of our friendship, she had imparted a\
  \ great deal of information about this place to me. Coorg is so special in every\
  \ aspect and the Coorgi community managed to retain a very unique identity, throughout\
  \ history, from even their closest neighbours.\n\nA few of us did visit her beautiful\
  \ Coorg many years ago, and so when she was getting married, I could not help but\
  \ take a few days break from my job, and escape into the unique beauty of Coorg!\
  \ Though I can visit Coorg anytime, this was probably my only chance in a lifetime\
  \ to see a Coorgi wedding! It\u2019s as important to see a Coorgi wedding as it\u2019\
  s to see Coorg itself.\n\nSo when the day came, I wrapped up my projects early and\
  \ rushed to take my bus. With a lot of anxiety of making it, through the stagnant\
  \ weekend traffic of Chennai, I barely managed to get the bus. I had a decent sleep\
  \ before I reached the city of Mysore, the capital of Tipu Sultan, which had its\
  \ own proud stories.\n\nMy second bus started from Mysore to Virajpet, the destination\
  \ for the Coorgi wedding. The bus went on and started climbing slowly into the Bandipur\
  \ National park. The natural landscapes I passed had the same profound impact on\
  \ me, like it had many years ago. The whole memory of my childhood Mysore trip and\
  \ the incident where a wild elephant chased our tourist van came back to me. I still\
  \ remember the smaller version of myself, terrified and clutching onto the door\
  \ handle of the van, while everyone else was screaming at the driver to speed up.\n\
  \nThe National Park, thankfully, left a more beautiful memory this time. The bus\
  \ passed through fields covered with thick fog, hugging the nature tight like a\
  \ heavy friend does. I passed a government board with the image of a tiger and something\
  \ written in the regional language. This made me apprehensive, though it wasn\u2019\
  t much of a concern since I was with the government bus service, which knew the\
  \ area well. We passed tall old trees and tea estates, places with narrow roads\
  \ and thick forests, with small towns springing up from time to time.\n\nAs we moved\
  \ ahead, we came across an elephant herd. Unlike the wild elephants that chased\
  \ me years ago, these were kept under human control. I couldn\u2019t figure out\
  \ what exactly it was since the government bus driver didn\u2019t find it that interesting\
  \ and drove off, unlike the tourist driver who took us long back. Yet the scene\
  \ with huge sheds among very tall trees, where the sunlight seeped in through the\
  \ leaves to show silhouettes of elephants moving freely in the dusty yellow morning,\
  \ was a beautiful visual splash onto my eyes.\n\nWith much anticipation, I finally\
  \ made it to my friend\u2019s wedding in the beautiful small town of Virajpet. The\
  \ wedding took place at a modern venue with rituals and setups that were the modernised\
  \ versions of Coorgi traditions. It was exciting to see men in the family, all dressed\
  \ up in old Coorgi warriors\u2019 attire, executing some of the age old tribal and\
  \ warriorship rituals at the wedding.\n\nFrom men cutting down banana tree stems\
  \ with their traditional Coorgi sword to signify their fighting spirit, to the groom\u2019\
  s family dancing in front of the bride for hours, blocking her way to the wedding\
  \ venue, to test her patience, the Coorgi wedding rituals were strange and exciting\
  \ at the same time.\n\nWith drinks, and Coorgi pork and other traditional food,\
  \ the wedding went on for more than two days, to give me one of the best escapes\
  \ I\u2019ve had from a normal life. This time into one of the most unique weddings\
  \ of India."
