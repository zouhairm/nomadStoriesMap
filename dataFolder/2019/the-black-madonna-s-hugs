Text: "At 50 km from Barcelona, the fantastically beautiful Montserrat mountain range\
  \ is located, among which the Benedictine monastery hid among the rocks - the spiritual\
  \ symbol and religious center of Catalonia, where thousands of pilgrims from all\
  \ over the world flock annually.\nNumerous legends are associated with Mount Montserrat,\
  \ and indeed it is so unusual that \nit causes delight and awe. The huge gray-black\
  \ boulders that make up the mountain rise like idols!\nOne of the legends says that\
  \ in the 9th century, on the slope of Montserrat, not far from the summit, was found\
  \ a statue of the Black Madonna. People tried to lower it down, but the farther\
  \ they carried it, the harder it became. The Bishop interpreted this as the desire\
  \ of the Mother of God \nto remain at the same place and he ordered to build the\
  \ chapel of the Virgin Mary, which became the beginning of the current monastery.\n\
  My journey to the Montserrat Monastery took place in May 2018. That time, the main\
  \ purpose of the trip was to enjoy incredible views and to hear the sound of the\
  \ sacred bells. The artist in me was not disappointed! Climbing the funicular to\
  \ the mountains, there was an opportunity to admire all the gorgeousness from the\
  \ heights of the beautiful mountains. The frilly mountains framing the monastery\
  \ are a place of power and simply a beautiful natural phenomenon. The building of\
  \ the monastery fits perfectly into the general view with its intricate architecture\
  \ and harmonious forms. Passing along the serpentine path, with each turn, new views\
  \ of the monastery and amazing landscapes open up. This walk took about an hour,\
  \ but gave a lot of unforgettable impressions and plunged into deep thoughts about\
  \ the meaning of life. Montserrat is one of those places where time stops. Against\
  \ the backdrop of a bustling life and the full bustle of Barcelona city, Montserrat\
  \ looks like a door into another dimension, it is a completely different reality.\
  \ But even in this holy reality, you\u2019re still staying a mortal person with\
  \ primitive desires like hunger, for example. \nThe sun was setting, the appetite\
  \ was taking hold of me more and more, the scenic path running along the rocks became\
  \ more ornate and seemed ominously endless. By that time, when I reached the central\
  \ square, souvenir\u2019s shops and cafes had been already closed, and there were\
  \ practically no tourists left.\nI sat down on a heated stone parapet overlooking\
  \ the valley. In Spain, it is not customary to hurry. At first, this is annoying,\
  \ but after a few days of being in this amazing colorful country you get used to\
  \ it and unwittingly for yourself you begin to live in this rhythm. Here I am, hungry,\
  \ but undisturbed, sat on the parapet, being fully convinced that I had seen all\
  \ the best for this day. I was planning to go back to Barcelona, when suddenly I\
  \ saw small black statuettes in the souvenir shop\u2019s window. I was intrigued\
  \ by this sight and suddenly realized that I had not seen the heart of the Montserrat\
  \ Monastery - the famous Black Madonna.\nI forgot about the Spanish \xABno hurry\xBB\
  \ tradition and ran off to the basilica. At that moment I did not expect to see\
  \ a miracle, I just wanted to satisfy my touristic curiosity. Church\u2019s candles\
  \ in multicolored glasses shimmered in the rays of sunset and fueled my interest.\
  \ I entered the temple one of the last and immediately found myself in the tourists\
  \ and pilgrims queue. The closer I got to the altar, the quieter my heart beat.\
  \ And so, I saw her in the twilight, divinely black, but so tender! For about a\
  \ minute, I was staying in silence, a baby cry brought me back to life. Behind me\
  \ there was staying a young girl with cornflower-blue eyes. She was holding a baby\
  \ in her arms. Both were crying from happiness. Fascinated by their unearthly beauty\
  \ and sincerity, I extended my hands to them. The girl approached and hugged me.\n\
  Later, I knew that the girl came to thank the Black Madonna for the fulfillment\
  \ of the most cherished desire - the birth of a son!"
