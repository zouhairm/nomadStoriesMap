Text: "I did not expect to find myself with a broken foot in Nagpur, India. If you\
  \ had asked me six months ago where in the world \u201CNagpur\u201D was, I would\
  \ have spun a globe and stopped it with my finger at random. If you had asked me\
  \ where on my body the \u201Cmetatarsal\u201D was, I would have said that sounds\
  \ like the name of a dinosaur, not a body part. Now I know that the metatarsal is\
  \ a bone in the foot (which can snap quite easily), and Nagpur is a city in central\
  \ India with tart oranges and dirt roads that are difficult to navigate with a walker.\
  \ Yes, I was given a walker instead of crutches, and no, I do not know why. \n\n\
  I did not expect, two weeks before I landed in Nagpur, to find myself in the hospital\
  \ in Hyderabad, India. I had lived in the city for about a month and naively assumed\
  \ the hospital was a place I could avoid. As I lay on a metal table tightly surrounded\
  \ by white curtains, waiting for the doctor to come solidify my swelling foot in\
  \ a cast, I asked myself over and over again \u201CWhy is this happening?\u201D\
  . Why did I break my foot in a country I will live in for just four months? Why\
  \ couldn\u2019t I have broken it at home over the summer? Why me? Why here? Why\
  \ now? \n\nAfter landing in Nagpur and being wheeled through the airport, I got\
  \ into a van with my boyfriend, his mom, and his mom\u2019s friend. It was too dark\
  \ to watch the city turn into countryside, too dark to see that cows started to\
  \ outnumber people, that feet started to outnumber shoes. Two hours later we arrived\
  \ at Kohka Wilderness Camp, our home in the jungle for the next five days. Several\
  \ young men greeted us with warm towels for our hands and a \u201Cwelcome drink\u201D\
  \ that tasted salty in the front of my mouth and sweet in the back. I let everyone\
  \ walk ahead of me to our room, except for my boyfriend, who walked with me slowly\
  \ as I strained to keep my left foot from touching the rocky path. I broke a sweat\
  \ in the cool night and asked myself again \u201CWhy is this happening?\u201D Why\
  \ me? Why here? Why now?\n\nI did not expect to ever find a papaya that wasn\u2019\
  t too sweet for my tongue. The fruit we had for breakfast at Kohka came from the\
  \ nearby village market, which we got to visit on the last day of our short stay.\
  \ We drove for about 15 minutes to the market. I unfolded my walker and stepped\
  \ out of the car into the sun. The streets of the village were narrow, and villagers\
  \ sat on blankets on the ground, selling toy cars and barrettes and spices and saris.\
  \ \n\nA man sitting in a car took pictures of me as I hobbled past because I was\
  \ foreign, because I was broken, because I was something he had never seen before.\
  \ \n\nAlongside me, the people I was travelling with took pictures of the villagers\
  \ selling their ripe vegetables because the villagers were foreign, because they\
  \ were barefoot, because they were something we had never seen before.\n\nI stopped\
  \ a moment to catch my breath and wipe the light sweat off my forehead. I tried\
  \ to forgive us all as we stood in front of each other, blocked by cameras and by\
  \ photos we would later show our friends, saying \u201Clook what I saw today\u201D\
  . A blonde girl who couldn\u2019t walk right. A brown man with broken teeth. \n\n\
  If not for the dirty cast on my foot, I too would have had my camera out. I would\
  \ have kneeled to capture the rainbow of bangles in the afternoon light, the rows\
  \ of green and purple and red vegetables, the boys piggybacking, the men folding\
  \ and frying samosas in the shade. Instead, I leaned against my walker and tried\
  \ to look, lensless, at my surroundings. Instead, all I have to show for my trip\
  \ to the village in the jungle in central India is an answer to my question \u201C\
  Why?\u201D."
