Text: "After a whole day of visiting amazing places, the day almost ended like a literal\
  \ train wreck.\nIt was our first day in Munich, Germany. It was past 6 p.m. when\
  \ we left Allianz Arena. My sister was radiant, having just visited one of the most\
  \ famous football arenas in the world. I was just tired, as we had spent the entire\
  \ day walking and touring around. \nMy family and I were on a European road trip,\
  \ as a celebration of my parents\u2019 25th anniversary. This was one of the many\
  \ crazy family trips we have had together. \nGoing back to our hotel meant that\
  \ we had to cross the Bavarian city from north to east in a one-hour ride by underground.\
  \ My sister took the lead checking the underground map and telling us which line\
  \ to get and to which direction. \nWe were having a normal journey so far, despite\
  \ the rush hour and the underground being packed with people who just wanted to\
  \ get home after a whole day of work. \nThings started to go south when we were\
  \ already near the hotel, and we just had to change lines.\nWe were waiting on the\
  \ platform as the carriage arrived and everyone inside it got out. We waited for\
  \ them, and then it was our turn to enter. We were the very first people to get\
  \ in, we sat and shared a sigh of relief, thinking \u201Cwe are finally able to\
  \ sit\u201D. \nBut it doesn\u2019t take long for the door to close and the train\
  \ to start moving, and my mom sees a woman on the outside gesturing \u201Cno\u201D\
  , she would say later. We looked around and we are completely alone in the carriage.\
  \ In a foreign country. And we didn\xB4t speak any German. Where are we heading\
  \ to, after all? \nI didn\u2019t know if I should laugh or cry, so I started yelling\
  \ and saying I\u2019d press the emergency button. My dad got really mad, saying\
  \ we could get a fine for doing it with no plausible reason. My mom and my sister\
  \ shared a feeling of fun and strangeness, maybe not appropriate for the moment.\
  \ But at the end of the day, we are all Brazilians who can\u2019t help but to get\
  \ involved in such crazy situations when travelling abroad.\nThe underground train\
  \ started to stop. We looked at one of those windows at the end of each carriage\
  \ and saw a confused young man in the next one, he was probably sleeping when it\
  \ all happened. \nIt didn\u2019t take long for a white haired, chubby man to appear\
  \ on the outside. He was the engine driver. He started to speak very angrily at\
  \ us in German. My dad, very calmly and in English, told him that we didn\u2019\
  t speak German. He continued to tell us off with the same energy, but in English\
  \ this time. \n\u201CHow could you not pay attention to the people around you!?\u201D\
  \ or \u201CHow did you not listen to the spoken warning given over the speakers!?\u201D\
  . The warning was about emptying the carriage, so the train could change lines.\
  \ In German. He told us to pay attention the next time we heard one specific word\
  \ (in German). We agreed, even though we knew that we wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize\
  \ that word ever again. He was going back to the station to leave us and the lost\
  \ young man. \nAs we arrived at the same station for the second time, he made sure\
  \ to give a spoken warning in English himself. We went back to the platform we had\
  \ been just a few minutes ago. \nAs the next train approached, we paid attention\
  \ to what everyone else was doing. Empty the carriage again to change lines. This\
  \ German man is so taken up in his phone and headphones that he enters in it. After\
  \ a few seconds, he looks around, sees he is alone and gets out before the door\
  \ closes, to his luck.\nHe may have been luckier than us, but he sure doesn\u2019\
  t have such a funny story to tell his friends."
