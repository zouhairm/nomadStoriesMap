Text: "It was almost time for the bird show at the zoo. But instead of watching the\
  \ trainer getting ready with the eagle in his hand, I couldn\u2019t help looking\
  \ back at the group of school kids that just settled in the audience. They were\
  \ around 8 or 9, black and white, all sitting together. What struck me was the sharp\
  \ contrast of their looks \u2013 the black kids all had dark skin with curly hair,\
  \ and the white kids were all very fair-skinned, often redhead with freckles or\
  \ blonde with blue eyes. Unlike what I\u2019m used to see back home in North America,\
  \ no kids were mixed or of any other race at all. \n\n\u2018My son is about this\
  \ age,\u2019 my tour guide John saw me looking, \u2018He goes to an English school.\
  \ Any kid can go there now.\u2019 John is from Johannesburg, South Africa, and his\
  \ native language is Zulu so he speaks English with an accent. \u2018It wasn\u2019\
  t like this when I was growing up. We weren\u2019t allowed to go to the same school\
  \ with the white kids. In fact, everything was separate. Public beaches, hospitals,\
  \ stores... Certain stores allowed everyone to go, but then there were two separate\
  \ lines \u2013 one for the blacks, and one for the whites.\u2019\n\n\u2018Really?\u2019\
  \ I was in disbelief, picturing the scene in my head, and wondered where I, someone\
  \ with Asian descend, would stand. \n\n\u2018Yap. We lived in separate neighborhoods\
  \ and spoke different languages. In fact, there are 11 official languages in South\
  \ Africa, with South African English and Afrikaans, a Dutch dialect, spoken by mostly\
  \ white people, and others from Zulu to Swati, spoken by everyone else, depending\
  \ on which part of the country you\u2019re from.\u2019\n\nFascinated by the diverse\
  \ culture and unique history, I continued to ask John more questions during our\
  \ visit. I heard about certain racial issues in South Africa before, but what shocked\
  \ me was how recent the separation had been. This happened till the 1990's \u2013\
  \ that is in our lifetime. As a millennial, I always see that kind of racism a thing\
  \ in the ancient past. In our part of the world, equality is taken for granted.\
  \ Anytime when we feel someone is discriminated based on their race, there\u2019\
  s always great controversy around the incident. \n\nFollowed John\u2019s suggestion,\
  \ I visited the Apartheid Museum in downtown Johannesburg. The museum is one of\
  \ a kind for sure. It was shocking to learn how apartheid ran South Africa from\
  \ the 1800's all the way until 1994. People\u2019s IDs used to list race alongside\
  \ their gender and birthday as a trait that defined a person, and consequently defined\
  \ that person\u2019s social status. Interesting enough, that could even be changed\
  \ with the government\u2019s approval. Asians, for example, could apply to become\
  \ \u2018honourable white\u2019 from \u2018coloured\u2019. I imagined myself initially\
  \ standing in the \u2018black\u2019 line in the store, then switching to the \u2018\
  white\u2019 line after my race \u2018changed\u2019. \n\nToday all has changed for\
  \ the better. What I see now is a beautiful, united country, everywhere people work\
  \ alongside each other, blacks and whites. But that\u2019s only after all the blood-shed\
  \ protests and fights from people like Nelson Mandela. \u2018That\u2019s why I said\
  \ to my son, your generation is truly the fortunate.\u2019 John said. \n\nAlthough\
  \ not on the surface, I\u2019m sure racial issues still exist in the country, and\
  \ race still defines the social and economic status in a way. As tourists, for example,\
  \ we\u2019re often directed to the white-majority neighborhoods like Pretoria or\
  \ Cape Town as popular tourist destinations, while the neighboring black-majority\
  \ towns are generally considered unsafe due to poverty and crime. \n\nThe next day\
  \ we visited Cradle of Humankind, a paleoanthropological site believed to be one\
  \ of the first places where modern humans appeared. So the origin of humankind is\
  \ from Africa, aren\u2019t we all of one race? Aren\u2019t we all Africans, after\
  \ all?"
