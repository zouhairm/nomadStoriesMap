Text: "First, it was the scenery. The moment the plane landed and I stepped out into\
  \ the dirt (literally), I felt I had entered another dimension. I was in Canaima\
  \ to see Angel Falls - the highest waterfall in the world - but now it felt I was\
  \ here for more. Time suddenly stopped and everything and everyone around me was\
  \ perfect. I was completely captivated by the gigantic rock formations surrounding\
  \ the town, by the way nature seemingly became a part of the man-made scenery, and\
  \ by the marvelous reflection from the lake outside of our hut I could see from\
  \ my window every night. \n\nBut it wasn't just nature that captivated me. The people\
  \ also won my heart. \n\nOutside of the reservation, the natives lived in town with\
  \ shops, schools, houses and The Club (yes, there was only one club which was used\
  \ religiously each night, I must add). There was always something happy about the\
  \ people and you couldn't but also become enveloped in that same bubble of joy.\
  \ In those fours days I stayed in Canaima, life became a little slower and more\
  \ meaningful with them. \n\nBut the natives were not the only ones there. In the\
  \ reservation, the tourist staff, including a mysterious American woman, also became\
  \ a part of life in Canaima.\n\nIt was the story of the American woman that most\
  \ intrigued me. She had lived her whole life in the United States where she met\
  \ her husband who was from Venezuela. They had had one son. In a tragic turn of\
  \ events, both her husband and son had died in a wrenching accident. Completely\
  \ heartbroken and lost, the American woman had sold everything and moved to where\
  \ she now lived in Canaima. She became the owner of an exotic shop that sold antiques\
  \ and beautiful pieces of art. She had decided Canaima would be her resting place\
  \ so she decided to create a magical world around her to see her off when that moment\
  \ came. \n\nAnother figure who will also be hard to forget was our tourist guide.\
  \ On the first day after the plane landed, we were greeted immediately by out tourist\
  \ guide, Pablo. He had all the qualities of the perfect travel guide: Tall, charismatic,\
  \ a great listener, and a wonderful storyteller. In all our excursions - walking\
  \ behind the Frog waterfall, going on extreme bike trails, and during the day long\
  \ trip to Angel Falls - he took care of us like we were his children. He was the\
  \ natural leader who made the trip worth every penny and more. \n\nThe day we were\
  \ to take the trip to Angel Falls, Pablo woke us up early in the morning so that\
  \ we could start the two hours wooden-canoe ride to the site. Our bottoms were literally\
  \ hurting from sitting on the wooden chairs by the time we reached the start of\
  \ the hiking trail. Three natives came with us to lead us in the four hours of hiking\
  \ up towards the bottom of the falls. It was an arduous climb, but none of us complained.\
  \ We were captivated. \n\nAs you entered deeper into the jungle, the immensity of\
  \ everything that surrounded you made you feel small but in a good way. I cannot\
  \ but describe this experience as a humbling feeling. It was magic, literally. \n\
  \nIt was through sharing the struggles with these strangers who became family, embracing\
  \ the awestruck nature of the place, and having the ability to slow down and breathe\
  \ that I gained a deeper appreciation for life. \n\nI went to Canaima hoping to\
  \ experience the beauty of the greatest waterfall in the world. I didn't expect\
  \ to find more than that. But I did. \n\nI found the comrade of strangers. I found\
  \ the strange ways life can change people. I found little pieces of myself reflected\
  \ in the people and the nature of the place. \n\nMost importantly, I found an eagerness\
  \ to continue seeking and experiencing the magic hidden in everyplace and in everyone\
  \ around the world."
