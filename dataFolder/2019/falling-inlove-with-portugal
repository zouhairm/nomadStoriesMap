Text: "My parents always stressed the importance of learning about the culture and\
  \ places of my home country and spending quality time with family because life passes\
  \ by so quickly.. As a family we were fortunate enough to explore and visit places\
  \ within and outside the border of Cape Town. We had spontaneous drives to the Southern\
  \ Coast, visited Cape Agulhas, Cape Point and various beaches. I took part in marathons,\
  \ swimming competitions, experienced hiking trails, visited the Aquarium, sight-seeing\
  \ and soaked into what Cape Town had to offer. \n\nOur annual family vacations to\
  \ places outside Cape Town included: Hermanus, George, Knysna, Port Elizabeth, Oudshoorn,\
  \ Betty\u2019s Bay, Langebaan, Cape Agulhus, Cape Point. These are fond memories.\
  \ I was exposed to different cultures, saw wildlife like lions, peacocks, crocodiles\
  \ to name a few. I even visited an ostrich farm and held an ostrich egg which was\
  \ the most moving experience. The cango caves and the Outeniqua Choo Tjoe steam\
  \ train was one of the most breath-taking and thrilling experiences I have ever\
  \ had; history has shaped itself into this beautiful portrait.\nInteracting with\
  \ locals  and exploring the timeless history. I spent most of my holidays in Upington\
  \ as a student. Upington is situated on the banks of the Orange River in the Northern\
  \ Cape. Surrounded by bright green irrigated vineyards, this area is known as the\
  \ Green Kalahari. Upington was unknown to me. It was unlike the city. People are\
  \ extremely friendly and their first language is Afrikaans. Upington is the centre\
  \ of the Orange River wine region and you could do a tasting in town at a co-op\
  \ of five different cellars.\n\nStill on a fruity note, an island in the Orange\
  \ River boasts one of the longest and most dense date palm avenues in the southern\
  \ hemisphere. For such a small town it has a relatively large collection of animal\
  \ statues. A donkey outside the museum pays tribute to the contribution of this\
  \ humble beast in the development of the region, and a camel outside the police\
  \ station commemorates the recalcitrant beasts on which the police patrolled the\
  \ vast Kalahari in the past. You could enjoy an exciting Augrabies Falls National\
  \ Park where you could do some white water rafting and view the magnificent waterfall\
  \ and canyon at its heart. \n\nMy travelling definitely enhanced my interpersonal\
  \ and communication skills. I believe that the exposure I encountered with diverse\
  \ cultures made me more flexible in my thinking, more adaptable, and much more open\
  \ to people\u2019s opinions that differ from mine. I am able to work with different\
  \ people, being able to listen and absorb their thoughts. We do not all think alike\
  \ and therefore being open enough to filter someone else\u2019s thoughts are vital\
  \ for life long learning."
