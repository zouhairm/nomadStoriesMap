Text: "I didn\u2019t know what was coming. \nAlone I was , with my Tuk Tuk driver\
  \ taking one turn to another ,lost in the streets of  Colombo 5, looking for \u201D\
  Mahesen by Fuzzoo\u201D, the guest house I pre-booked online.\nFinally,I reached\
  \ there at 9:10 in the night. The guesthouse\u2019 caretaker told me that she has\
  \ already reached, long before me. I rushed upstairs to our room and knocked at\
  \ the door with elation. No answer came from inside. Maaz, the care taker of the\
  \ guesthouse fetched me the room keys .To my surprise, when I opened the room, it\
  \ was messy, with suitcases unpacked, one lying on floor and the other on the bed,\
  \  room lights switched on.\n But, Halla wasn\u2019t in the room.\nI became super\
  \ worried and curious for where is she now, because Maaz didn\u2019t see her leaving.\
  \ I tried to reach her by contacting on Whats App, left message for her on Facebook,\
  \ but all in vain.\nI had never met Halla before in person. We used to follow each\
  \ other on Facebook only. Last Eid, we exchanged wishes and chatted for around twenty\
  \ minutes. She seemed like a soul mate. Exactly, like me, she wants to travel the\
  \ world, meet new people and love smoothies and cycling. She told me that she plans\
  \ to visit Srilanka after two weeks and by late evening, I was applying for a Srilankan\
  \ Visa, online. Sudden plans are best? Believe me that spontaneous travel plan changed\
  \ me, for the best!\nIt was God from the skies who wove this friendship from Karachi\
  \ to Colombo just for Javeria and Halla to meet and build an unspoken bond in the\
  \ island of Srilanka. \nTime was not passing and her continuous absence gave me\
  \ the heebie-jeebies .After forty three minutes (Yes, I was counting time), the\
  \ doorbell rang. I opened it, and saw Halla for the first time.  She smiled wide\
  \ at me (she has a gap in her teeth) and hugged me tight, as if two best friend\
  \ had meet after long. She was wearing blue from top to bottom. Her hair were tangled,\
  \ with blond highlights streaked through thinning black hair. She looked impish,\
  \ yet adorable and beautiful.\n\nShe grabbed my hand and got me upstairs to our\
  \ room. She made me forget how worried I was just two minutes ago, with her merry\
  \ presence. I knew at the moment, she was different, she is a blessing!\nShe started\
  \ giving me details of her day that how she bumped into a Srilankan wedding and\
  \ for the first time ever in her life, went to a bar. (Halla mentioned that she\
  \ didn\u2019t sip a drop of alcohol). I was so happy to find her, she was the friend\
  \ of my dreams and I still cannot contain the joy to find her when I least expect\
  \ it.\nShe seems so much fond of photography as if she was born with a camera following\
  \ her around all the time, or she does it to earn some extra bucks.\n\nWe\u2019\
  ve stayed up late. talking, slept in , moving on from one town to the other, from\
  \ one guest house to another ,ate lots of\" Kotu\",drank a lot of margaritas and\
  \ smoothies, walked on beaches, power napped, did some work, had more coffees, slept\
  \ in again, no pattern vacation. It was!!\n\nBrewed friendship with two German guys\
  \ at the Sky lounge Colombo , connected with the locals in the Spice Garden of Ella,\
  \ had breakfast by the sight of falls and dinners by the sea. We cycled around Galle\
  \ and enjoyed to its fullest , the Hikkaduwa's night life. Did I mention, we spent\
  \ an amazing day in the Whale watching Cruise in Mirissa.\nHalla is not like the\
  \ one you meet in a caf\xE9 shop in an exotic island, have some chat and then bid\
  \ an emotional farewell. \nShe is the one your heart feels\u201D where have you\
  \ been for years?\"\n \n-Whatever alchemy it is, that brought us together, I couldn\u2019\
  t be happier than to be with her"
