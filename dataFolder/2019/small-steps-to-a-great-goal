Text: "I remember it was the summer of 2002. My grandmother took me with her for the\
  \ first time. It was such a new and unusual experience for me - I had never seen\
  \ such ships, and it was a real adventure for me to ride along the Volga River.\
  \ Long wet decks, seagulls circling around, a lot of tourists from around the world,\
  \ taking pictures of beautiful sunsets on their film cameras, sailors working tirelessly\
  \ in blue overalls - all this was happening to me, Kukushkina Rita, a resident of\
  \ the small village of Nikolskoe, in the Vologda region, the population of which\
  \ does not exceed 500 people.\nOn the boat, I met a girl named Ira - she was older\
  \ than me. One day I approached her and saw her reading a book in a foreign language.\
  \ \"Do you want me to teach you a little English?\" \"Sure!\" - I said. Of course,\
  \ these were simple phrases, but how interesting they were!\nOnce, while walking\
  \ along the ladder to the shore of another beautiful city, I saw Ira standing on\
  \ the pier and talking to someone. She was speaking in a language incomprehensible\
  \ to me (English), - For some reason she smiled sweetly at the interlocutor, and\
  \ he smiled back. What are they talking about? Why are they smiling? It seemed to\
  \ me so interesting - to speak another language, think in it, understand, respond,\
  \ laugh, and share one\u2019s thoughts with a person from an entirely different\
  \ country, with a person from another world. At the moment, I realized that I wanted\
  \ the same! At the age of nine I didn't expect to find that traveling and speaking\
  \ a foreign language is undeniably cool: - it's how you meet new acquaintances and\
  \ learn new ideas. I have always been an outgoing and loquacious girl: - I love\
  \ communicating with people, and when I realized that communication can go beyond\
  \ the borders of my village or even the country - I set a goal, which I am still\
  \ pursuing - to learn English and travel outside my village.\nAfter that first encounter\
  \ on the ship, I did not see Ira again. She left the next day. But I will never\
  \ forget those small phrases she taught me, \"My name is ...\" \"How are you?\"\
  \ and \"What is your name?\"- These are the first small steps on the way to a great\
  \ goal. That day, I approached every person on the boat, most of whom were Chinese\
  \ tourists, and asked how they were and what their names were, and in return I received\
  \ vague answers and a smile on their faces.\nI always wanted to connect my life\
  \ with foreign languages, so I entered the faculty of foreign languages, culture\
  \ and arts at the Vologda State Pedagogical University in 2010. In the 10th and\
  \ 11th grades, I took extra classes in English, and every weekend I went to another\
  \ city, which is 1,5 hours from my village, to an English language studio for courses.\
  \ My teacher, Anna Vladimirovna, inspired me to study the language; she presented\
  \ the material in such a way that every lesson was an exciting learning opportunity\
  \ and I realized that I wanted to do the same! Those lessons with her inspired me\
  \ to open my own English language studio and teach children English with love and\
  \ enthusiasm, like Anna Vladimirovna did.\nLife at university was also full. In\
  \ my group, I was the head student. This helped me become more responsible, resilient\
  \ and flexible. Together with my classmate, we organized a club of spoken English\
  \ and discussed different topics, including: sports, books, and traveling.\nNow,\
  \ only four years after graduating from the university, I have a successful English\
  \ language studio in my native town. During this time, I participated in several\
  \ business competitions, where I was awarded prizes in the field of education. These\
  \ recognitions gave me a huge incentive to develop further and further. \nThis year\
  \ I will travel again with my grandmother on another trip by boat along the same\
  \ stretch of the Volga river, only not as a passenger, but as an volunteer - a teacher\
  \ of the English language hobby group for young tourists and a coordinator for youth\
  \ activity, but that's already another story ..."
