Text: "The story how I ended up in Kazan is a weird one in itself. Actually, I could\
  \ now say that all this was not my fault. After all, I only went to the seminar\
  \ because the actual spokeswoman had canceled. On the way back I had to take the\
  \ tram from Bonn to Cologne, because the bus came too late and then all trains were\
  \ canceled because of a suicide. On this tram I met a person who introduced me to\
  \ another person who encouraged me to sign up for a course in Norway. There in Norway,\
  \ I was placed with the best team mates I could ask for and one of them was Vladimir.\
  \  Actually, it is Vladimir\u2019s fault. \n\nDuring one of the breaks in our project\
  \ when he and I stepped outside to catch a breath of the cool but not freezing north-Norwegian\
  \ air, he asked me if I ever been to Russia. I shook my head. It had never really\
  \ occurred to me what people found interesting about Russia. For me Russia related\
  \ to people I went to school with and international political turbulences. I did\
  \ not tell him that, I simply shook my head. He asked if I was thinking about going.\
  \ I answered in a more diplomatic way than a head shake: \u201CIt is not really\
  \ on my list at the moment\u201D. Vladimir did not buy into it. \u201CYou should\
  \ go sometime. It\u2019s nice there!\u201D These words echoed in my head when I\
  \ applied to a trip to Kazan. This and because of the German national team, who\
  \ had impressed the name Kazan in my memory by a very miserable appearance in the\
  \ World Cup there.\n\nYet my first emotion when arriving in Russia was confusion.\
  \ I do not speak Russian and cannot read Cyrillic letters. Therefore, I prayed to\
  \ all the gods that the train I took from the airport to the city center of Moscow\
  \ was the right one. It was and it took me to the Red Square. When I stepped out\
  \ through the gates onto the square the sight hit me with a notion. I was in Russia.\
  \ And it was not what I expected. Around two corners from the square was a KFC.\
  \ I stayed there for a few hours to take a deep breath. I had no internet, I had\
  \ no clue. Moscow was just my starting point to get to Kazan but already I felt\
  \ this trip was going to have a lasting impact on me. Because, as you already figured\
  \ by now, I have a tendency to get talked into things by other people, I had decided\
  \ to take an overnight train from Moscow to Kazan. \n\nBy the point I got on the\
  \ train I was exhausted. The environment was very different and extremely confusing\
  \ compared to every trip I had taken before. And now I had to spend the night in\
  \ a little train cabin with four strangers? It was awesome. Even though no one spoke\
  \ English and my lack of Russian, we got along so well and managed to have sweet\
  \ conversations which were a mix of English, French, German and Russian bits pieced\
  \ together to make sense. By the time we crossed the Wolga river and came closer\
  \ to Kazan, I had my happy self-back and looked forward to what would come. \nLooking\
  \ back at my time in Kazan now, it has become blurry. The group I was with had the\
  \ most amazing young individuals and we managed to see a lot of this impressive\
  \ city that has such a rich history that goes back way beyond the time that I learned\
  \ in school about Russia. And in one clich\xE9 vodka-soaked night I started a process\
  \ of reevaluating my life that continues to this day I write these lines. Staying\
  \ in Russia took my conscious and what I learned about the world until this point\
  \ and shook it like a snowball. Russia was not where I expected to find myself again.\
  \ Like Vladimir said, it\u2019s nice there. But it is so much more."
