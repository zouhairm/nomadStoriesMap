Text: "Despite growing up with band practises and performances, music had never truly\
  \ moved me. That was until I expected silence in the Cambodian Choeung Ek Killing\
  \ Fields. A silence which was instead amplified with a soundtrack my grandmother\
  \ had played since before I could even walk.\nMy group only had a week in Cambodia\
  \ so I wanted to make it count. We\u2019d already been to the grandiose temples\
  \ of Siem Reap and chillaxed Coconut Beach of Koh Rong before heading to our final\
  \ stop- Phnom Penh. On Koh Rong, I was told it would have the least things to do.\n\
  \u201CContemporary History is one of my favourite things to study as it still has\
  \ such a profound impact on society,\u201D I scoffed, \u201CI want to visit the\
  \ Killing Fields and S-21 when there. Excited is the wrong word that people seem\
  \ to use for morbid things; I prefer enlightening. We need to know how messed up\
  \ our mindsets can be since despite hearing of these events, we still continue to\
  \ spiral downhill into segregation and conflict.\u201D\nI\u2019d been to Ypres,\
  \ Auschwitz and Birkenau with my school and all of them had given me an anguished\
  \ yet motivated mindset. A desire to get out there and do something to stop the\
  \ recycling of these events in the future. So while I didn\u2019t want to learn\
  \ about the morbidities humans were capable of causing, these sorts of places oddly\
  \ fascinated me.\nOne term we heard in Chiang Mai, Thailand was \u2018temple tiredness\u2019\
  . While they are all laden with individual beauty, too many in one day would make\
  \ you lose your wondered fascination. However, the disheartenment in some humans\
  \ and empathy for others felt in these places never dissipates.\nBefore going to\
  \ Auschwitz, my grandmother said birds never fly there. So, I was surprised at how\
  \ much wildlife was around Choeung Ek. For an extra 3USD you could buy an audio\
  \ guide, but even with that playing, birdsong still commenced. While hearing of\
  \ the graphic, brutal murders that went on in the exact space I was standing, other\
  \ animals were thriving. My brain was in overdrive trying to comprehend it.\nIt\
  \ feels numbingly weird to write this, but Choeung Ek is beautiful. There\u2019\
  s plenty of trees and it feels almost like a forest clearing. These beautifully\
  \ masked their own history as instruments of torture. One had hundreds of coloured\
  \ bracelets upon it, but again it hid sickening secrets- this one was used for smashing\
  \ the skulls of innocent infants. Here particularly, people had left notes expressing\
  \ their wishes that the victims have peaceful afterlives. \nAt the back of the site\
  \ is a huge lake which you can sit around and contemplate. It was here where I heard\
  \ something I didn\u2019t expect to find.\nThe audio guide mentioned a piece of\
  \ music that it was going to play around halfway through the guide so the listener\
  \ would have a few minutes to think about what they\u2019d heard and seen so far.\n\
  It was Pran\u2019s theme from the Killing Fields Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.\n\
  I\u2019ve unfortunately never watched the film but my grandmother has had the soundtrack\
  \ for decades. While working in her little sewing room, she\u2019d play mass orchestral\
  \ pieces which would move your emotions around rather than your feet. This just\
  \ so happened to be one of said records.\nMy mind whirred. While sat watching the\
  \ pristine lake, just metres away from mass graves which still had protruding bones,\
  \ I began crying. Hearing that soundtrack which reminded me of home but knowing\
  \ it was based on the events that happened right where I was sat was overpowering.\n\
  One thing I love about travelling is coming to the realisation that the pictures\
  \ people upload and show are in fact physically existing on the same planet as us-\
  \ they aren\u2019t just a piece of artwork. However, making that connection between\
  \ such a poignant audio and this physically soul-crushing place was something I\
  \ wasn\u2019t anticipating but really hit it home for me how real the events of\
  \ Choeung Ek were."
