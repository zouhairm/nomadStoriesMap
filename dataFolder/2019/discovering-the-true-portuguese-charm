Text: "The relationship between Portuguese and Indonesia has been established since\
  \ the 16th century, where they are known as the first European to establish a colonial\
  \ presence in the East Indies. On their search to find valuable spices, the Portuguese\
  \ also leave their legacies in our culture in form of the romantic keroncong guitar\
  \ ballads, as well as a large number of Indonesian words which reflect Portuguese's\
  \ role as the 'lingua franca' of the archipelago. They are also the first European\
  \ nation that introduces Indonesia to Christianity. These Christian communities\
  \ are still lasting in Eastern Indonesia throughout times to contemporary times.\
  \ \n\nTo visit Portugal will give me an opportunity to see what the country and\
  \ the people are really like. It would also be a great opportunity to see how is\
  \ the connection between the two countries actually developed in this current era.\
  \ Indonesian traveller is currently at a bring of discovering unique destinations\
  \ to visit and the European continent has always been a favourite. A country like\
  \ Portugal with the connection link to the past will surely give that interesting\
  \ appeal for many Indonesian travellers to visit. Therefore, I am keen on participating\
  \ in this scholarship and to have direct local experience with the people and the\
  \ country."
