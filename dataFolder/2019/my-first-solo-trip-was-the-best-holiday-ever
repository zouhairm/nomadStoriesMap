Text: "I travelled to Sorrento alone on what was meant to be a holiday with my boyfriend.\
  \ We had broken up 2 weeks before but I decided it would be good to get away. \n\
  I was completely unprepared, it was supposed to be a very relaxed, hotel pool based\
  \ trip but when I arrived I looked around for things to do and 2 days in I got on\
  \ a train to Naples. \nI meandered through the train looking for a seat and sat\
  \ down opposite a young man who eventually caught my eye and asked me a few questions...\
  \ if I was English, was I alone and why was I alone. \nI explained and he laughed\
  \ as the same thing had happened to him, only his relationship had ended a few months\
  \ previously. \nHe was going to Pompeii (I had been there the day before) so we\
  \ agreed to meet later back in Sorrento. \nWe went out that night and had a really\
  \ good time, we met some other people and decided to go to Rome the next day. We\
  \ stayed overnight in Rome, had a whistle stop tour of some of the sights and met\
  \ some of his friends who were on a city break there. \nWe also went to Capri, Positano\
  \ and Amalfi on the following days before I was due to leave. I had so much fun.\
  \ \nIt gave me a real taste for travelling alone, which was something that scared\
  \ me before and the trip was the perfect antidote for what was a really difficult\
  \ time of my life."
