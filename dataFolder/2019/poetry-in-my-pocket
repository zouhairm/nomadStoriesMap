Text: "Chirping birds, hovering flies,creeping ants, all in a thicket, a beautiful\
  \ flowery deep woods. Shinny but mossy with age. Smiley sun at a full glare on the\
  \ earth. Ripples of water sing in lowest tones in the hush and shiny but haze summer\
  \ noon.\u201D Come put in the bags and baggage in the boot.\u201D The round loopy\
  \ space in an old rickety motor car. A ramshackle old locomotive object, although,\
  \ bodily-aged but very much at heart; the engine, super new, super effective! My\
  \ uncle, Yisa had instructed we put in all luggage in the boot of the old \u2018\
  papi\u2019. Yisa, who was like the captain of the ship, the leader in the journey\
  \ had instructions dished out to us all, a team of twelve persons. We were setting\
  \ out on a journey to a sister country, Togo in the western region of Africa. As\
  \ we are  indigenous Nigeria, Togo and Nigeria are birthed by mother Africa. Nationals\
  \ of sister countries with similar cultural and religious back-grounds. That made\
  \ it much easier as we all yearned to see and have in a full glare what Togo looks\
  \ like as we never once had been there. Anyways we had, had the opportunity of learning\
  \ about Togo on the geographical maps and perhaps we have had to watch documentaries,\
  \ Television series or even seen journals and listened to news about happenings\
  \ in the country. Yisa, a medical doctor and one with a good economic status had\
  \ all finances burdened on himself, he is a selfless being. Journeying to Togo was\
  \ all an easy one, an all -expense paid trip, by just one fellow! I am still very\
  \ much most grateful to him for the kind gesture. Lest I forget, we were out to\
  \ take a wife in Togo, yes, a beautiful wife! Clam-clunk, the motor-car moved a\
  \ hippety -hop move a dusty heavily galloped road of Ikorodu, a suburb of Lagos\
  \ State in Nigeria. It moved on this manner for about half an hour until it came\
  \ onto a neatly tarred road, an express way which leads to the town centre. At this\
  \ point, all twelve of us had had full round of dance-in reggae as a result of the\
  \ hopping car which had plied a bad road. At the part-line between the bad road\
  \ and the beautifully tarred road, the motor \u2013car was as ready as an athlete\
  \ on a field waiting for the whistle to be blown and then, run into the thin air\
  \ with his or her legs as fast as they can carry him or her. The car did zoom off,\
  \ like a bird let out of a cage. Cool breeze of nature soon blew on a few of my\
  \ co-travelers and they soon slept off. Particularly, a middle-aged family member,\
  \ Nana was snoring heavily. She was fagged out. She had stayed up all night doing\
  \ some cookery to be taken along in the journey. Like the mother hen she is, she\
  \ likes to cater for everyone. Everyone had to let her into her deep sleep. \u201C\
  She needs it\u201D, said Tolu. Very typical of me, I got myself a seat at the window\
  \ side. As the driver drove past every village and town, I had a reflection on all,\
  \ a vivid imagery of each scene conceptualized. A reckoning with reality of happenings\
  \ on everything sited by my two pairs of eyes. These visualization and critical\
  \ thinking got all my sensory at work as I got into a whole deep thought. At the\
  \ mention of the name, Port-Novo, I joggled back to happenings around me, happenings\
  \ right inside the bus. They had been served meals and, Josephus, who was seated\
  \ right beside me, offered me my own share. We had gotten to Benin Republic, a commercial\
  \ country in West Africa. Landscape, food, language, social activities, education\
  \ all are of similarities with Nigeria\u2019s. As from a far distance, I could hear\
  \ family members ranting and chanting, I was drowned in my thought. Before we arrived\
  \ in Lome, the nation\u2019s capital, I had written a handful of notes, on each\
  \ flip, a poem. Most interestingly, a poem about the lake city, which appeared seemingly\
  \ peaceful."
