Text: "Wallace Stegner once wrote \u201CThere is a sense in which we are all each\
  \ other\u2019s consequences.\u201D Looking at how life throws you a curveball, turns\
  \ and roundabouts makes you wonder if what Stegner mentioned holds significant truth.\
  \ About two years ago, I was a hotshot paediatrics surgeon who had a decent paycheque\
  \ and busy lifestyle that required me to push through 80 hours week at a local government\
  \ hospital. I travelled for conferences and humanitarian efforts with a well-known\
  \ organisation that enabled me to see what life has to offer other than academics\
  \ excellence and fitting into social norms. \n\nGrowing up as a poor gay Indian\
  \ in an unaccepting Asian community and family, is a minority to the power of four,\
  \ minuscule and insignificant. I grew up feeling so. Until I grew out of it, when\
  \ I stepped into the unknown; pursuing my undergraduate studies in Singapore, a\
  \ country neighbouring to Malaysia, that to my surprise, is so different than similar.\
  \ And so I tried to fit in, again. \n\nLeaping into the unknown seemed to me that\
  \ I needed to be someone who the society would accept and cherish and not someone\
  \ I really was, at least that\u2019s what I learnt in academics; the thesis and\
  \ anti-thesis, the republicans and the democrats, the Barbie dolls and the football,\
  \ the devil and the angel. Traditional academics, be it at home or at an institution\
  \ seemed to favour the extremes, forming a perception that is like a binary signal\
  \ that switches between two states of Boolean value; 0 and 1, false and true and\
  \ nothing like a spectrum in a rainbow with each colour carries its significant\
  \ strength. \nChange didn\u2019t happen overnight for me, as how my brain shoots\
  \ hormones as a reaction formed over 20 years since birth. But soon, I figured the\
  \ missing pieces of puzzles. I realized it\u2019s not about fitting in, but rather\
  \ finding your role in this dynamic symbiotic relationships we have with people\
  \ and environment, thanks to leaping into the unknown repeatedly. \n\nIn Yemen,\
  \ I was told not to try to understand the marriages that happened between a teen\
  \ girl and a 60 year old man but to treat the sexual injuries inflicted by the husband\
  \ to the teen girl. In Nepal, I saw how nature can be so unforgiving killing lives\
  \ under building rubbles, orphaning little hungry kids who ran around stealing food\
  \ as people who used to feed them were then dead.   In Philippines, I experienced\
  \ the hospitality of a catholic community who had lost everything after Hagupit\
  \ Typhoon struck their country.   \n\nI could have succumbed to the theory of evolution\
  \ on how the fittest survives and the weak perishes, but I did not. I realized the\
  \ whole point of my journey leaping into unknowns, meeting so many characters, identifying\
  \ various emotions, adrenaline and experiences are all preparing me, reversing my\
  \ thought processes, adapting me into new facts. Forming me. Darwin was so wrong\
  \ about how natural selection can change a species in small ways adapting to new\
  \ environment happens over the course of several generations. It happened to me\
  \ in the course of a decade. \n\nI found the love of my life, in a person, a cat,\
  \ a dog and in food. I enrolled into a culinary program at Le Cordon Bleu in Malaysia,\
  \ completing a 9 months Culinary Diploma course and set out to open my own restaurant,\
  \ leaping into the unknown world, yet again. I was repeatedly told what a great\
  \ mistake I am making, leaving behind my medical career and pursuing a new career\
  \ after my 30\u2019s. The bureaucracy didn\u2019t cut me any slacks either, no banks\
  \ did grant me an easy loan as advertised online. However, I overcame the hurdles\
  \ and curve balls thrown at my direction, because leaping into the unknown my entire\
  \ adolescence has thought me to be resistance and adaptable to change, because change\
  \ is the only constant thing. My goal in life did not entirely morphed, I still,\
  \ want to take hold great responsibility in whatever I serve on people\u2019s plate.\n\
  \nI might succeed or I might not, but I will get past that and become better."
