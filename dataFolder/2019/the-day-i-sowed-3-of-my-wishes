Text: "The charisma of the inhabitants is one of the tourist references of Northeast\
  \ Brazil, and I bring evidence. There are those who say that in a city of such natural\
  \ beauty there is no reason for any hint of unhappiness, as a tourist I can only\
  \ agree and recall the good memories of this place.\nIt is a city that tells a lot\
  \ about the history of the country, the birthplace of marshals, honored in statues\
  \ that by the way, I learned something that I won't forget: the position of the\
  \ horse's paw reveals how the person who was riding died. For example, when the\
  \ two front paws are raised, the soldier died in combat; when only one is raised,\
  \ he didn't die in the conflict, but because of a wound resulting from the combat;\
  \ finally, when the horse has four paws on the ground, the soldier died of natural\
  \ causes. Speaking of statues, I can't help but address the Statue of Liberty that\
  \ the city was given. It is an original but smaller sketch of the famous statue\
  \ situated in New York.\nIn the city there is a belvedere from which it is possible\
  \ to have a privileged view of the city. As soon as we disembarked there, I received\
  \ five red seeds and there we had to make three requests and throw three seeds back\
  \ to the belvedere and the other two to save. I still have the two seeds in my wallet.\
  \ I do not remember what the requests were, and if I remembered I couldn't tell\
  \ them, but I must have done it right, at least I remember this as a year of growth.\
  \ Maybe it wasn't just because of the seeds, but also because I met the little village\
  \ of San Miguel dos Milagres and drank from the famous miraculous water and, finally,\
  \ I had all my prayers for the year heard.\nWe know the famous S\xE3o Francisco\
  \ River, or Velho Chico for the closest ones. Known for its importance to the region,\
  \ an area of \u200B\u200Bgreat backlands, where drought may be cruel, but not enough\
  \ to shake the lightness with which people that live there."
