Text: "I love public transport. A firm subscriber in the adage that \u2018the journey\
  \ is as important as the destination\u2019, I not only tolerate days in transit\
  \ but revere them. When else can you sit and listen to 3 records uninterrupted,\
  \ napping and snacking intermittently? And for a fraction of the price of a plane\
  \ fare? \n\nGrowing up in semi-rural Australia braced me to prepare myself for travel\
  \ times from a young age, and the thriftiness of my parents and their insistence\
  \ on us taking the cheapest method possible for getting around instilled in me endless\
  \ patience for transit. I\u2019ve taken buses interstate at all hours of the morning\
  \ just to go to my grandparents\u2019 house, and optimistically thought I was well\
  \ poised for a rail adventure across SE Asia.\n\nAfter all, how can someone complain\
  \ when they are lucky enough to be travelling in the first place?\n\nMyself and\
  \ my partner were all set to take a number of overnight trips across the beautiful\
  \ countryside of Vietnam; $8 train tickets purchased, with blankets packed, headphones\
  \ at the ready and a can of semi-warm beer in my handbag. We were ready for the\
  \ 13 hour trip from Hue to Hanoi. \n\nConsidering how many carriages these trains\
  \ carry, it is actually quite remarkable that they are able to traverse the sometimes\
  \ unruly, unpredictable but always amazing countryside of mountainous Vietnam with\
  \ the frequency and speed that they do.\n\nThe cabin itself seemed like pure luxury\
  \ compared to the hard concrete ground of the train station. Two sets of bunks lined\
  \ either wall and a small table in the middle completed our tiny travelling home\
  \ for the evening. We settled into one bunk and gave a friendly nod of hello to\
  \ our cabin companion; a young local mother with a baby who was politely sitting\
  \ on one of our beds. We assumed she had a ticket for the bed above and so paid\
  \ no mind as she settled in with the blanket and pillow. \n\nThe train rumbled along,\
  \ and at the next stop an elderly local couple also entered the cabin. They each\
  \ took one of the upper beds, and promptly fell asleep. The train shunted off with\
  \ a yell from the carriage attendant who inspected our tickets. Our 4-person cabin\
  \ seemed suddenly very full, with 5 adults and a baby inside.\n\nAfter initially\
  \ panicking that we had somehow gotten on the wrong train and were taking up someone\
  \ else\u2019s bed, our fears were assuaged temporarily with the entrance of another\
  \ local family, and the carriage attendant once more. \n\nHe pointed to the bed\
  \ opposite my own and yelled. Possibly at us, or at the family, or maybe at the\
  \ woman and her baby. I didn't know what was going on, and it was roughly 3am. Without\
  \ a word, the family that had just entered also sat down on the bed. All 3 adults\
  \ smiled at me, and looked bafflingly comfortable. I had so many questions. Who\
  \ were these people? Was this the correct train? At this point, the elderly couple\
  \ above us woke up as a result of the commotion. They revealed 6 ears of corn and\
  \ roughly 14 boiled eggs from somewhere in their luggage and began to eat.\n\nAn\
  \ hour passed in complete silence. Two babies began to sleep. The older couple fell\
  \ silent once more. My partner curled up with the bag and slept. Perhaps the shouty\
  \ train attendant was also asleep by this point; the sun was about to rise.\n\n\
  The sound of a sharp horn emitted from the train and a dog yapped through the corridor.\
  \ We were nearing the next stop. Silently, the two families with young children\
  \ slipped out of our carriage. I was left in the relative peace and quiet of the\
  \ older couple who were now eating soup and the small, yapping dog who had made\
  \ its way into our cabin.\n\nThe sun was peeking across the mountains, and the early\
  \ morning light was illuminating the lush green farmlands outside our window. The\
  \ gentle rocking of the train, and the soothing comfort I took in the knowledge\
  \ that we probably were on the correct train after all put me to sleep almost immediately."
