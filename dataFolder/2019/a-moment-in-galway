Text: "I spent couple of hours in the downtown of Naples, in a cozy bar, which functioned\
  \ as a bookstore during the daytime. Alice and I were sitting beside a large window\
  \ by the street, a typical lava stone paved street of Naples. Whilst drinking a\
  \ Pecorino wine, I came to the realization that I was comfortably numb, but this\
  \ time it was not the wine. All throughout my life I have been a curious being,\
  \ excited by anything outside the realm of my small knowledge or understanding.\
  \ That night I noticed a book on the shelf, titled \u201CLuxor and the Temples valley\u201D\
  \ but it did not, in the slightest, spark my curiosity. No thoughts of Egypt, no\
  \ connections to geography or the myriad of museums I have visited so far on my\
  \ travels. In that moment that book was just a stone in the wall. It was late and\
  \ the next glass of wine was the last. \nThe day after, it was lunch time with my\
  \ boss. Music was playing behind me from a small TV. Often, he likes to show off\
  \ his exciting experiences he had during his trips around the world. He started,\
  \ \u201CIn 2005, when I was strong enough for hiking the Himalayan\u2026\u201D.\
  \ My mind disengaged from his all too familiar monologue and I was jolted by a sudden\
  \ deep understanding. \u201CI\u2019m 35 right now\u201D \u2013 was my first thought.\
  \ While we asked for the bill, the fast chain of thoughts stopped when I realized\
  \ two things: so far, I have travelled a lot, but most of the time my trips were\
  \ just an escape from boring days. However, this was not the worst feeling. The\
  \ other was that through some trips I was just following wishes and desires of Irina\
  \ and other people\u2019s expectations. So, this time, I was looking for a new trip.\
  \ My trip. \nThere I was, ready to embark on my wants, my desires. During the landing,\
  \ the airplane shook like an earthquake and some people cried with happiness as\
  \ we touched Ireland\u2019s soil. After that I had a quick dinner, just in front\
  \ of the hostel in one of Galway\u2019s many cozy taverns. I had some local sausages\
  \ and potatoes. I was just sitting by the entrance and in front of me there was\
  \ a sign on the wall.\n\u201CI will not serve that in which I no longer believe,\
  \ whether it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to\
  \ express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as\
  \ I can, using for my defense the only arms I allow myself to use \u2013 silence,\
  \ exile and cunning. \u2013 (J. J.)\u201D \nEverything, all together, quickly became\
  \ a source of joy. The morning after I woke up with the desire of gazing out upon\
  \ the ocean. I had a look at the map and the curiosity guided me to South Park beach,\
  \ easily reachable through a sandy path crossing a flat grassy landscape with rare\
  \ shrubs around.\nAs I reached the beach, a new, powerful feeling took over me,\
  \ and it\u2019s like that experience is present tense.  I\u2019m here, on this bench.\
  \ I would like to cry. A stupid happiness wipes out any other thought. I would like\
  \ to be with Irina, she would enjoy this moment, even if she never had a trip like\
  \ this in her mind. I can see and almost feel in my body a few elements of this\
  \ scene. A few meters away from the bench, where the flourishing grass ends, the\
  \ small grey beach starts. First cobblestones, then sand and then dark seaweed before\
  \ the ocean dominates the view. A wind, strong enough to cover the other sounds,\
  \ comes straight ahead from the ocean, forming low waves, arranged in large circles.\
  \ It is difficult to distinguish where the cloudy sky starts, but after all that\u2019\
  s one of the magic ingredients of this isle. My eyes then rest on the misted Mutton\
  \ Island on my right, but I feel free to look somewhere else whenever I want. A\
  \ deep sense of freedom is what I have in my body at this moment, an unexpected\
  \ one."
