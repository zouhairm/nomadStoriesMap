Text: "For the first time in my life I decided to pray. I tried to conjure the words\
  \ to send skyward, but as soon as the idea entered my head the lurching of the Bangka\
  \ on another giant swell sent it shooting straight out again. I was back to gamely\
  \ clinging on for dear life. \n\nAfter being stuck in a tiny fishing village in\
  \ the Caramoan region of the Philippines, the typhoon finally abated enough for\
  \ the coastguard to declare that a boat would attempt the two-hour journey back\
  \ to town. Inwardly cursing my constant desire to get far off the beaten tourist\
  \ path, I\u2019d trudged to the jetty with the locals for whom the journey was necessary\
  \ for peddling their wares and purchasing supplies. \n\nThe coastguard stood bellowing\
  \ instructions that were falling on deaf ears; everyone clambered aboard before\
  \ he changed his mind. An official looking man with a clipboard and a wide smile\
  \ approached and asked for my emergency contact details. At my look of confusion\
  \ he explained in the most incongruently cheery way, \u2018in case of sink, ma\u2019\
  am\u2019, smiling even more broadly. \u2018Oh, umm, ok\u2019, I stuttered, relaying\
  \ the information with growing apprehension.\n\nIn the small vessel the assault\
  \ on my senses was overwhelming, each stimulus fighting for supremacy. As the salt\
  \ water lashed against my skin and hit my tongue, the screams of passengers rang\
  \ in my ears. The stench of sea sickness crowded my nostrils, and the swirling water\
  \ just inches away looked dark and foreboding. Someone gripped my hand; I turned\
  \ to see the mascara streaked face of a young man, his panic filled eyes speaking\
  \ to me in a silent universal language I didn\u2019t know existed until then. In\
  \ English and Filipino, we uttered words of comfort that couldn\u2019t be understood.\
  \ On the two other spaces of our bench sat his band mates, adorned in glitter; a\
  \ budding pop group on their way to an audition, faces ashen under the eye shadow\
  \ and blush, a macabre scene.\n\nThe front of the boat suddenly reared up and came\
  \ crashing down hard. One of the huge bamboo poles running along the canoe\u2019\
  s length was torn loose and disappeared into the stormy darkness. For a second it\
  \ was as if all sound had been sucked into a vacuum, the deafening incredulous silence\
  \ soon broken by renewed howls of fear. I sat, stunned, staring at the space where\
  \ the stabilising bamboo had lain. My mind flashed over the statistics I\u2019d\
  \ read about questionable maritime safety in the Philippines. I thought back to\
  \ the landscape ravaged by scars, evidence of Typhoon Yolanda, a super typhoon that\
  \ had caused widespread devastation the country was still recovering from. I realised\
  \ I would ultimately return to the safety of the UK with its distinct lack of natural\
  \ disasters. But for these people living remote from civilisation, the people clutching\
  \ my hand and using their bodies to shield their children from the sting of the\
  \ spray, basic survival seemed reduced to an all too regular battle of boat versus\
  \ storm. \n\nThrough the mist our destination finally came into view. As I hurriedly\
  \ set my feet onto solid ground a sense of calm enveloped me for the first time\
  \ since we set out. I glanced around as a ripple of nervous laughter and back-slapping\
  \ spread. There was a bond between us, a togetherness and understanding, respect\
  \ and affection, we\u2019d survived.\n\n\u2018You definitely need to add this experience\
  \ to the censored list when speaking to mum and dad\u2019, I said to myself as I\
  \ shuffled, jelly legged and sodden towards the bus station."
