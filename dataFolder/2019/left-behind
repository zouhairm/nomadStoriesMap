Text: "We arrive just as the sun begins its slow cascade up over the tops of the mountain\
  \ ridges. The sky is opaque with haze; still and even. The old man searching for\
  \ truffles, mutt at his heel and a stick in his hand trundles down the dust track.\
  \ The August heat is already blistering, with not even a breeze to offer relief.\
  \ The village is sleeping, held captive by a perpetual slumber.    \n\n     Men\
  \ as old as the surrounding mountains smoke and play cards at Bar Tabacchi on the\
  \ corner of Capodichina. The town has only twenty-four citizens. Three of them perch\
  \ outside the caf\xE9. Their leathered skin is the colour of espresso and seems\
  \ even darker under their cream vests and gold chains. They have not moved in ten\
  \ years, as if they are artefacts in a small-town museum. Donata still wears her\
  \ stained tabard. She mutters to me in Italian and asks \u2018understand?\u2019\
  \ I nod in timid compliance. She cooks fillets of white fish on an open fire and\
  \ places it on the table where it is immediately lost amongst the spread. Smells\
  \ of garlic and oregano permeate my senses. I am five years old again.\n\n     The\
  \ house we were to occupy for two weeks was that belonging to my father\u2019s Uncle\
  \ Pietro. The smell it retained can only graciously be described as unique. It was\
  \ musty, like a blend of aged colognes and poor ventilation. I can still feel the\
  \ marble floors on my bare feet as I chased my sister, and the airless smell as\
  \ my mother cracked open the stiff shutters on the ground floor. The house was dark\
  \ and abstruse, reminding me of a monastery with its high cobwebbed ceilings and\
  \ wrought iron stairs. The orchard to the rear of the house had the opposite effect.\
  \ I had an affinity with nature from a young age, so upon learning of all the wonderful\
  \ fruit and vegetation that was in season on my doorstep, I was enthralled by my\
  \ new secluded garden. Tomatoes, pomegranates, figs, kiwis - to name but a few -\
  \ sprouted from the ground and the tree branches above. I marvelled at the natural\
  \ abundance of something I\u2019d only seen in crates at the shops. A photograph\
  \ shows me standing in the mud with my t-shirt fashioned as a hammock, which was\
  \ full to the brim with ripe plums, my plump and rosy cheeks syrupy with the juices.\
  \ \n\n    The town of Atina was the lively and animated centre, comprised mostly\
  \ of family owned restaurants, markets, coffee bars, gelaterias and pizzerias. It\
  \ was like a postcard you might buy or a scene from cooking show \u2013 the familiar\
  \ narrow cobbled passages, ochre fa\xE7ades with sage-coloured shutters and small\
  \ balconies overflowing with foliage. The air was infused with rich coffee and Vespa\
  \ fumes. Grandmothers strolled with prams in one hand and children in the other,\
  \ wearing headscarves and gold Cornicellos around their necks, brimming with wisdom\
  \ and authority. Their eyes teeming with stories ready to tell and the lines in\
  \ their faces as deep as their secrets. I remember the tastes more than anything\
  \ else \u2013 green beans in lemon juice and stracitella soup with parmesan at Massimo\u2019\
  s. Chewy dough, mild cheese and sharp tomato paste. Salty hams and peppery rocket.\
  \ The pizzeria in Ponte Melfa was one of my favourites. I remember the orange hue\
  \ from the dim lights, spilling at the seams with people and queues forming for\
  \ a taste of the famous pie. \n\n     When I returned ten years later, I was faced\
  \ with two realities. The reality that like most things, Atina had regressed; the\
  \ recession had taken its toll and people had boarded up what was once their livelihoods\
  \ and moved to the cities. Or perhaps it was more a melancholic realisation that\
  \ I had grown up and everything else had remained the same. Actualities which I\
  \ had been shielded from were now within unapologetic eyeshot. I remember the lethargic\
  \ excitement, driving from Rome at six in the morning, up a track so narrow it seemed\
  \ impossible. My skin began to prickle with the dust. It was the last realisation\
  \ that niggled at me; Atina had been left behind, and it would never catch up."
