Text: "Arriving in Bangkok did not prepare me for the amazing variety of locations\
  \ I would experience in my 2 week journey.  Exploring Bangkok was interesting to\
  \ see a city in Thailand.  Next was Sukhothai, Ayutthaya, the summer palace, the\
  \ khmer ruins, Chiang Mai, and Chiang Rai.  These were all fantastic places with\
  \ a myriad of sights and events.  The Cabbages and Condoms market was the most eye\
  \ opening.   The most pleasurable was visiying the Elephant Nature Park in Kuet\
  \ Chang.  We had the opportunity to bath, feed, and care for rescued elephants.\
  \   It was amazing to see how capable of uding their trunks like we use our hands\
  \ and arms to receive bananas and gourds to place in their mouths.  \nThe most awe\
  \ inspiring was visiting Wat Rong Khun, the white temple, in Chiang Rai.   The temple\
  \ is such intricate sculptures depicting the masses reaching up to be saved as you\
  \ walk across the walkway to the temple.  It is a picturesque location that looks\
  \ like it was put on Earth by a god.  \nThe food and massages were delicious and\
  \ amazing throughout this trip.  I  was a bit taken aback at cost before converting\
  \ currency.   A massage cost 1,200 Bhatt.  I was worried, until I realized that\
  \ was less than $2.  For a fabulous time with a very reasonable cost, visit the\
  \ Country of Thailand and experience a whole new world!"
