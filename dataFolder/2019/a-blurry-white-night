Text: "I knew flying from Sarasota, Florida to St. Petersburg, Russia, was ambitious.\
  \ A delay in Atlanta resulted in missing my flight to St. Petersburg, so I spent\
  \ a blurry day in the Schiphol airport- giddily waiting to be put on the next flight,\
  \ a late evening connection through Riga. \n\nI rearranged the pickup for my pre-booked\
  \ taxi, as I knew well to never take an airport gypsy cab! Waiting to board, after\
  \ successfully reaching Riga at around 22:30, I congratulated myself on managing\
  \ a tough travel day. I even enjoyed our turbulent flight, being tired enough to\
  \ find the glamour of entering Russia in the middle of a stormy night. \n\nAt Pulkovo,\
  \ I waited at the luggage carousel\u2026until it was clear that all of the bags\
  \ (minus mine) and been dispensed. Concerned about connecting with my hotel driver-\
  \ and without a working phone- I hurried over to the lost baggage counter. After\
  \ a few moments, another couple joined me. \n\nThe agent handed me three identical\
  \ forms \u2026in Russian. Exhaustion won, and the tears came. While I could sound\
  \ out letters and recognize a few words, my Russian studies had focused on verbal\
  \ communication skills, not reading. I stepped to the side, and smiled sadly at\
  \ my line-mates, when the man offered me a Kleenex and, in a gentle Irish accent,\
  \ asked if I was all right. Touched, I admitted it had been a rough trip and I was\
  \ afraid I would miss my hotel ride. He sympathetically introduced himself and his\
  \ girlfriend as John and Celine, and then suggested we tackle the forms together.\
  \ The two were in Russia for the first time on holiday, and neither spoke the language.\
  \  My courage returned; I could help our little group. We managed the triplicate\
  \ forms, and, at around 3:30 in the morning (approximately an hour and a half after\
  \ our flight had landed) we entered the empty arrivals hall. We hoped perhaps one\
  \ of our hotel- booked taxis might have waited, but no.  I knew there was a bus\
  \ that ran to the  Moskovskaya metro station, from which I could navigate. As we\
  \ went outside into the still-light June night to seek the bus, John realized that\
  \ even if we could get a bus at that time; their hotel was on Vasilevskiy island.\
  \ During White Nights, the drawbridges were opened, and the islands are cut off\
  \ until 6 am.\n\nUnable to find the bus stop, and realizing that in all likelihood,\
  \ it would not run at that hour, we faltered. My adamancy about avoiding gypsy cabs\
  \ was slowly waning with the prospect of several hours in the airport arrivals hall\
  \ as the only alternative. Celine was equally uncomfortable, but John thought that\
  \ with him there, we would be safe. Overcharged, but we\u2019d make it.  We decided\
  \ to go to my hotel, on the Fontanka, where they could wait until the bridges closed.\
  \ \nFinally making eye contact with the gypsy cab drivers, we approached one. As\
  \ the only Russian speaker, I had to broker the deal. A fair price to the hotel\
  \ was between 800-1,000 rubles. The driver quoted 5,000 rubles. We walked away,\
  \ but then 5,000 became  3,000, then 2,000. I countered with 1500: we had a deal.\
  \ Our driver took the streets so fast, that it felt as though we were flying. Entering\
  \ the city did not slow him down in the slightest, and we arrived at my hotel in\
  \ record time. I alone had rubles, and handed over 1500. Angry, he claimed we owed\
  \ 3000, threatening to go to the police. John, seeing his aggression, edged in front\
  \ of me. I made a decision: better to pay him an unfair price than risk ugliness.\
  \ Task done, we went inside, where John and Celine were eager for translation. \
  \ We discovered we weren\u2019t ready to part\u2026we felt like celebrating! It\
  \ was five am, and the hotel bar-man bemusedly served us some cognac and beer. Drinking\
  \ to our success at arriving safely, and to the joy that new friends could result\
  \ from even the strangest situations, six am rolled around and as John and Celine\
  \ headed to their hotel (in a pre-booked taxi). I could hardly believe it\u2026\
  it was time for bed!"
