Text: "Sharm el-Sheikh. It is about 33 degrees. Hot sticky air penetrates my pale\
  \ skin from first second after descanting from the ramp, making a sharp contrast\
  \ with the coolness on board. I am wearing black boots, jeans and a jacket, thanks\
  \ to a higher providence, at least in a light T-shirt. Everyone rushes to the border\
  \ control, struggling to be the first to pick up luggage, while the travel company\
  \ buses wait for their guests in the parking lot, the accompanying guides have fun\
  \ chatting and fanning the folders with guest lists. These parking lots are almost\
  \ always the same - it's hot, but a cool wind blows, then you sit inside, you can\u2019\
  t adjust the air conditioner for a long time and wait for about an hour to get to\
  \ the hotel. This is one of those lazy trips to the sea, to look at the fish, then\
  \ snorkel, and then return to the beach and lie on a deck chair under an umbrella.\
  \ At the airport, it is necessary to take off shoes with buckles, a belt, and let\
  \ the woman in white gloves examine me and my carry-on baggage, realizing that the\
  \ other line is moving much faster. At this time, you can watch airport\u2019s wildlife.\
  \ This airport resembled a large white tent, or rather several tents, similar to\
  \ either craters of volcanoes or snowy hills, although how do they know what it\
  \ is. Children whimper, while adults impatiently sharpen on the spot, those who\
  \ are in a hurry take up several queues at once. You know, I have never paid attention\
  \ as in other countries they protect suitcases from damage, but in our country,\
  \ we can wrap our baggage tightly with kitchen wrap or plastic bags with scotch\
  \ tape on our own. It always looks ridiculous, but it is justified from the point\
  \ of view of my countrymen, especially if there are a lot of these suitcases.\n\
  I come to passport control and find out that staying in the territory of Sharm el-Sheikh\
  \ and many others - a visa is not needed, but in order to see Cairo, you still need\
  \ one. Of course, any capital attracts beginning travelers as the cradle of the\
  \ country's cultural life. Well, you know there are Sphynxes, pyramids, museums\
  \ and colorful bazaars. At the bazaar, the crowded streets pulsate like one big\
  \ artery, and I will choose various beautiful knick-knacks, but no papyrus. This\
  \ also distinguishes the apartments of many Ukrainian travelers: papyruses, Chinese\
  \ fans, a fridge hung with magnets, and many hotel jars of shampoos and small bottles\
  \ of Duty Free. In Egypt, I immediately recall the film \u201CThe Mummy\u201D, its\
  \ picturesque views of the city and the gloomy tombs of the Pharaohs, where the\
  \ characters get into funny, scary and intriguing situations, while the mummy Imhotep\
  \ hunts for them. That's my turn. The young Egyptian smiles at me with a broad smile,\
  \ his hairless head glistens in the sun, his eyes are large and brown, and the sleeves\
  \ of his blue shirt barely cover his broad shoulders, he looks relaxed. He examines\
  \ me, and I have my passport with stamps from past trips. I remember each and on\
  \ which border I was placed. This was my first visa, since I began to travel when\
  \ Ukraine introduced visa-free travel with Europe. This shiny, sticky piece of paper\
  \ shimmered green and emerald, creating the impression of the wings of a scarab,\
  \ the very one from the movie \u201CMummy\u201D. It didn\u2019t look like the ugly\
  \ neon barcode I\u2019ve stuck at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv. The visa cost\
  \ $ 25, another $ 5 cost to stick it. We affably smile at each other, phrases on\
  \ duty sound, and then the border guard says: \u201CMaybe you stick it on your forehead?\u201D\
  . A smile slips from my face, and I say, \"No, thank you.\" And it is believed that\
  \ the British have a strange sense of humor... After that, there was a rise to beautiful\
  \ Sinai with its breathtaking dawn, a smelly blanket for $ 3, a silent Bedouin and\
  \ the beautiful Red Sea with its corals and fauna, but we did not fly to Cairo.\
  \ I remember each of my stamp in the passport. And you?"
