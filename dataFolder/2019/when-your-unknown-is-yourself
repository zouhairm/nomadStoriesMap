  s life and a never ending list of premade-sounding phrases came to my mind every\
  \ time someone encouraged me to go round the world to \"find myself\". \n\nI can\xB4\
  t deny I was somehow lost. I didn\xB4t know what I wanted to find either. \n\nWith\
  \ no expectations, I took a no return flight to Rome. The amazing fountains kept\
  \ reminding me of home; the delicious ice cream tasted like home as well. \n\nA\
  \ few days went by. All I could think about was related to how an uncountable amount\
  \ of things reminded me of my cozy house. \n\nUp until then, though I was really\
  \ enjoying Italy, nothing new had happened to my inner self. This resulted reassuring\
  \ to me. It felt as if someone was padding my back and telling me I was right: there\
  \ was no solution to finding yourself when traveling miles and miles away from home.\
  \ \nBut this would soon change. \n\nA culinary stop in a world-renowned restaurant\
  \ faced me with some flavours that brought me back to my childhood. I remembered\
  \ my first trip to Italy, and how happy I was back then. I remembered my parents\
  \ were still together. My head got full of memories of what it had felt to be part\
  \ of a family.\nI then realized everything made sense. I was feeling at home, because\
  \ Italy was home of so many remembrances for me. At the end of the day, Italy was\
  \ home.\n\nLooking back in time to those days makes me think that if I hadn\xB4\
  t found myself back then, I would have never been able to grow up from those childhood\
  \ memories. No matter how old my passport said I was, until that trip, my head was\
  \ still stuck and looking back to when I was 5 years old, and that\xB4s how old\
  \ I frequently felt. \nThat\xB4s not me anymore."
