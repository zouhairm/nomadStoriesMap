Text: "\u201CGoa- A beauty and a dream\u201D\nSo I finally decided that I wanted to\
  \ see Goa in December as it gets really exciting with the Christmas celebrations\
  \ adorning beautiful houses all over.\nWhile going from GOI airport to Calangute,I\
  \ passed through Panjim which wasn\u2019t lit well in night except with the calmness\
  \ which fills your heart when in Goa.I reached Calangute and was welcomed by my\
  \ host being so kind to help me with the directions.\nI couldn\u2019t resist myself\
  \ and reached the nearest Calangute Beach.Walking on the sand lit by small lanterns\
  \ all over,I reached the shore.As it was dark,could only feel the waves hitting\
  \ the shore.I stood there and when waves hit my feet I felt so welcoming and accepted.It\
  \ was a feeling of immense joy and happiness and all I could say was,\u201DThank\
  \ you\u201D.I felt like shouting and saying that I finally made it.I left from the\
  \ beach for my place,but had this curiosity to see what more Goa has for me.Next\
  \ morning I got up.I put my best clothes on and headed to Baga beach on my scooter.After\
  \ a beautiful ride,I finally reached Baga beach which is in North Goa itself.The\
  \ place was crowded with localites calling tourists to visit their shacks and the\
  \ Happy travellers clicking photographs,soaking themselves in the heat of the sun,children\
  \ making sand dunes,some of them flying high in air in their parachutes,local women\
  \ engaged in adorning tourists hair with colourful strings of thread.Everything\
  \ looked just so beautiful.I found a place from where I could get a close view of\
  \ the water and the sun rising higher.\nI sat there looking at it for several hours.By\
  \ the evening I left for my place I had this strange feeling to go back and keep\
  \ admiring its beauty.\nI came back,had some food and went off to sleep,writing\
  \ stories in my head and describing it to my friends when i go back to my town.\n\
  Next day was meant to explore more about the place locally,enjoying their cuisines,meeting\
  \ localites,shopping etc.\nTo my surprise I found that not all the people living\
  \ in Goa belong to that place.When I asked what brought them here.They simply said\
  \ the beauty of the place,where they feel home away from home and can work to make\
  \ it a better place.\nSince Goa is mosty benefited with tourism,people there are\
  \ mostly into occupations like fishing,hosting in Airbnb,restaurant business and\
  \ adventure sports as these are some of their major sources of income.I went to\
  \ Candolim which is very lively as on either sides of the road you find live bands\
  \ in the restaurants playing music,people engaging tourists in their local produce\
  \ freshly brought for sale.After enjoying my sumptious lunch at an open air restaurant,I\
  \ left for Candolim beach.By the time i reached the sun started setting in and the\
  \ cool breeze hit the place.I spent my whole evening sitting on the shore of the\
  \ beach and looking at the waves touching my feet,everything looked so picturesque.It\
  \ looked like there\u2019s a different world on the other side of the water which\
  \ I want to explore.\nOn my last day I headed to Arambol beach which is a divine\
  \ beauty in itself with its backwaters and the beach.On 1 side where u find sweet,calm\
  \ and serenity of the backwaters.On the other side u find waves rushing to the shore\
  \ with salt and sand.It was dark by the time I returned from the beach riding my\
  \ scooter,singing songs and reaching Vagator where I planned to stay for a day.I\
  \ reached my place in Vagator,and instantly reached out to my diary to pen down\
  \ my thoughts which were filled with joy and excitement .Goa happens once in life\
  \ and if you are lucky to travel it all by yourself,then do not miss the chance.\n\
  I bid adieu as I sleep with all the thoughts in my mind and feelings in my heart.\U0001F60A"
