Text: "Climbing the towering hillsides flanking Colombia\u2019s notorious city of\
  \ Medellin are barrios so dense they look like they have been painted onto the landscape.\
  \ The people who live in the barrio of Comuna 13 had long been physically isolated\
  \ from the city below because, practically, getting home was the equivalent of climbing\
  \ a 32-story building. This was once Escobar country, so lawless and inaccessible\
  \ that whatever money that made anything better in Comuna 13 was drug money. After\
  \ Escobar\u2019s death the drug trade continued its control of the community until,\
  \ in 2002, the Colombian military carried out the infamous Operation Orion in which\
  \ 1,000 policemen and soldiers assaulted a neighborhood of 100,000 inhabitants.\
  \  People were killed. A frightened but unified community took to the streets waving\
  \ white rags, and the conflict abated.\n\nFast forward to today. A series of innovative\
  \ city administrations have installed a series of escalators threading the barrio\
  \ to connect residents to their city. The idea was to foster access and employment\
  \ for the people of Comuna 13. But there was a troubling bit of left-over lawlessness\
  \ that needed to be dealt with, graffiti taggers. Kids with cans of spray paint\
  \ were illustrating blank spaces on walls and buildings, and that prompted harsh\
  \ crackdowns. Then someone in officialdom must have said \u201CWe might want to\
  \ take a look at this stuff\u201D. The story justifies morphing the word \u2018\
  tagger\u2019 to artist because Colombia has now become famous for its street art,\
  \ and graffiti is a poor misnomer.\n\nThere is one remarkable image rendered on\
  \ a two square meter wall in Comuna 13. It\u2019s a profile of a indigenous woman\
  \ with flowers in her hair. She has delicate bronze skin tones, eyebrows tapering\
  \ to individual hairs, a moist sheen on the lips, and a glint of light in a deep\
  \ brown eye. It\u2019s a street Mona Lisa and was done by some young Colombian with\
  \ cans of spray paint. \n \nFresh off one of the escalators my wife and I strolled\
  \ past a young man just finishing a mural of a flamboyant fire-spewing dragon. \
  \ He was taking a break to spray paint bicycles belonging to a couple of small boys\
  \ who had stopped to watch him work. He was aware that we were admirers and an exchange\
  \ of smiles led to a good-enough conversation in his struggling English and our\
  \ tourist Spanish. His name was Pablo. He was 27. The mural was dazzling. We told\
  \ him so and our interest lit him up. He explained that graffiti artists want to\
  \ tell the story of the violence, repression and liberation baked into the memories\
  \ of even young Colombians. Pablo showed us an Instagram photo on his mobile. He\
  \ along with two friends created a mural on a derelict 9-story building in Bogota\
  \ to honor a teenage artist killed by police in one of their crackdowns. It showed\
  \ a charming, if cryptic tableau, depicting a boy in a cap, five stories in size,\
  \ being carried in a sling by a fantastical flying stork. The scope of the project\
  \ by three artists hanging from ropes was impressive enough, but what Pablo would\
  \ show us next was astounding. He tapped the Instagram image and the mural was suddenly\
  \ animated. The fantastical stork was flapping its wings to a thumping musical track.\
  \ Here was a revolutionary meet-up of art, technology and hip-hop. These young men,\
  \ suspended with homemade rigging, had re-painted portions of the mural 60 times,\
  \ taking successive photos to create animation.\n  \nWe met Pablo a week later in\
  \ Bogota. He toured us through dicey neighborhoods, explaining \u2018that\u2019\
  s where the canvases\u2019 are\u2019. It\u2019s worth a reminder that this work\
  \ is done with cans of spray paint.  We asked Pablo, surely the fine lines of an\
  \ eyebrow and the sparkle of light in an eye must be the work of brushes and stencils.\
  \  Sometimes, he said, but he and his friends were spray can purists. \n \nI can\
  \ only say to the art world what Medellin\u2019s city officials said to themselves\
  \ years ago. \u201CYou might want to take a look at this stuff\u201D.\n\nIn the\
  \ meantime, these young people are being sponsored by unconventional patrons of\
  \ the art world, companies that sell cans of spray paint."
