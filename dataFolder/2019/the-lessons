Text: "I\u2019d never hiked the mountain before. When Nina, my housemate, asked if\
  \ I want to go to Bromo with her, I suddenly said \u201COf course!\u201D. I thought\
  \ it\u2019d be a great experience, since I had much free time before start my master\
  \ degree.\n\nWe started our trip, with other housemates and Nina\u2019s friend,\
  \ at 00:00 am. It took about two and half hour by car. The road was quite challenging,\
  \ but our guide had good driving skill. The weather was getting cold and I wore\
  \ my jacket. When we arrived at post, our guide served us some breads and hot tea.\
  \ It was a perfect combination in the cold late night.\n\nAfter had our early breakfast,\
  \ we headed to Bromo by jeep. I\u2019d never in the jeep, so I was pretending if\
  \ I got kidnapped (jeep is linked with kidnapper\u2019s ride in Indonesia), but\
  \ I enjoyed the ride. Once we arrived, there were already a lot of people who were\
  \ ready to hike the mountain. Our guide told us to do morning pray first before\
  \ go to Love Hill. Even though the water irritated my skin (the temperature was\
  \ 60 C), I should not leave my duty as a Muslim.\n\nWe climbed stairs to reach the\
  \ hill. I was bit tired, but I kept going because I was really eager to see the\
  \ sunrise near the mountain. We arrived and waited for few minutes before enjoy\
  \ the scenery. There was a fence along the hill that kept visitors not fall into\
  \ the mountain. I jumped over it carefully because it was risky and I took my best\
  \ position to get pictures.\n\nHere came the sun! I\u2019d never expect if the sunrise\
  \ was looking so beautiful. It was \u201Cshy\u201D in the beginning, but its red-orange\
  \ shine made me feel so calm. The shine swept the mountain top slowly until it touched\
  \ my face. I was getting more impressed and I praised God for His creation. \n\n\
  After enjoyed the sunrise, we went to Whispering Sand. It was so-called because\
  \ when the wind blew, the sand grains flew and sounded like a whisper. It was also\
  \ a shooting location for Indonesia\u2019s film, Pasir Berbisik. Then, we headed\
  \ to Teletubbies Hill. It named after its similarity to Teletubbies series. Unfortunately,\
  \ the grass was dry. We did not enjoy the scenery fully.\n\nFinally, we arrived\
  \ at the last place, Bromo crater. Our guide asked us to have a walk or rent the\
  \ horse because the jeep could not bring us near to it. We decided to walk for few\
  \ kilometers and followed others. At some moment, we lost the direction but we were\
  \ bit hesitant to ask the locals. We just kept on walking and arrived at the cliff.\
  \ The locals laughed at us and said \u201CThat is the wrong path. Why don\u2019\
  t ask for help?\u201D I was embarrassed and we turned back to the right one. Then,\
  \ we climbed another stair. I was so exhausted, but others kept asking me to climb\
  \ and said \u201CIt will be useless if we do not reach the top. We already here.\u201D\
  \ I gathered my energy back. Once we reached the top, we were amazed by the crater.\
  \ Its sound made me feel bit scare somehow.\n\nThe time was around 10:00 am. We\
  \ went down and rented the horse, since we had no energy to walk again. I was struggling\
  \ to ride the horse, but later on I was getting used to. Then, we got in the jeep\
  \ and be ready to went home. All I can say if this experience taught me some life\
  \ lessons \u2013 do not hesitant to ask for help and keep moving forward until reach\
  \ the destination."
