Text: "I hail from India, but currently reside in United Arab Emirates. A solo travel\
  \ idea struck me when I couldn't afford to travel home but had just enough money\
  \ to fly half way to the land of temples, good people and great mountains: NEPAL.\n\
  I'm Linfriola Shanel Pinto and my adventures began right at the airport when I was\
  \ lost and made a happy friend Carmyn who was a South African and we fly together\
  \ to Nepal from Dubai. It was a thrill to start from the city capital Katmandu,\
  \ and roam around the tantalizing streets of Thamel; shopping, bar hopping and bargaining\
  \ and meet some amazing people always ready to help you with the roads and to suggest\
  \ places. I also had the opportunity to stay with a local family and I felt welcomed\
  \ and lived there for a day as one of them. They taught me how to make Momos, a\
  \ very popular Nepal delicacy and also took me to their relatives place and around\
  \ the neighbourhood and to Boudhanath temple which was rich in Buddhist heritage\
  \ and culture. I was later joined by another friend from India, Reynold and I further\
  \ explored more temples; Pashupathinath temple, Darbur Square, Muktinath temple\
  \ to name a few and we relished Thukpa, fried buffalo meat and Dal Baath, which\
  \ are few other Nepali delicacies.\nNext, me and Reynold travelled on a local bus\
  \ to Pokhara the city of lakes and we stayed by the Phewa Lake overseeing the green\
  \ pastures and beautiful strides of mountains. \nThe following day we hired a 2-wheeler\
  \ and visited the other lakes, Davis falls, went paragliding. We also visited Pokhara\
  \ Shanti Stupa, a Pagoda style buddhist monument which is located on the hill top\
  \ of Ananda hill and next we headed to the village of Sarangkot in the outskirts\
  \ of Pokhara city, to view one of the most beautiful Annapurna Himalayan range.\
  \ \nThe next day I was re-united with Carmyn and we explored different cafes around\
  \ the pokhara city and met some amazing people both locals and travelers from other\
  \ countries. I joined Carmyn in visiting an NGO which was a home to children who\
  \ were abandoned or displaced during the Nepal earthquake and this NGO provided\
  \ a home and future to these children. We instantly got connected to these little\
  \ kids and in no time we were dancing and playing with them. This was one of the\
  \ most unexpected yet most touching and memorable part of the travel.\n\nOn the\
  \ last day, me and Reynold decided to trek and since we didn't have enough time\
  \ to head to Annapurna circuit for an elaborate 9 day trek, we set out by ourselves\
  \ in the opposite direction from the Pokhara city towards the high mountains and\
  \ villages, absolutely not knowing what was ahead of us. We were also in search\
  \ of this remote place called Ghati Cheena, which was recommended by a friend that\
  \ we find and witness the nature's rendezvous by a beautiful waterfall. After covering\
  \ quite a distance we realised we only had ATM card and just 30 Nepal Rupees and\
  \ a water bottle. But we still continued with great optimism and when we could no\
  \ longer continue we settled down for a smaller waterfall and enjoyed the nature's\
  \ bliss completed dehydrated and tired. \nAnd after a relaxing time we covered the\
  \ journey back to our accommodation completely drained out and that was the moment\
  \ we realised how truely amazing of an adventure it was, absolutely without money,\
  \ minimal water and lots of patience.\nWe had managed to cover 2 hills, 3 villages,\
  \ 4 streams on foot one way. This was the highlight of our trip.\n\nAfter a relaxing\
  \ night we had to leave pokhara and back to Kathmandu. With heavy heart and heap\
  \ full of memories we bid farewell to the land of temples, good people and grear\
  \ mountains and headed back to Dubai."
