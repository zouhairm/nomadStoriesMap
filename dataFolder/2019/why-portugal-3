Text: "Why portugal? Interesting if we write a wishful dream of visiting a country\
  \ called Portugal. I am grateful to be able to dream of going to the country of\
  \ Portugal, while perhaps most residents in Indonesia will prioritize other needs\
  \ rather than the need to travel to other countries.\n\nThe question is why should\
  \ I go to Portugal? Most Indonesian citizens if asked which country they want if\
  \ they have the opportunity to Europe, the average will definitely answer France,\
  \ England, or maybe the Netherlands.\n\nMany countries in Europe have beautiful\
  \ landscapes, beaches, old cities, clean lakes, cool air, a city without pollution,\
  \ historical heritage, which certainly becomes the main attraction when we visit\
  \ a country\n\nIf I am asked what you know from the country of Portugal, I may now\
  \ only be able to answer Portuguese egg tart, football player Cristiano Ronaldo\
  \ :) and once colonized East Timor (now become Timor Leste)\n\nNow I am becoming\
  \ increasingly curious about what and how beautiful the Portuguese state is. If\
  \ the country can have a great soccer team at the world cup, of course this country\
  \ has more value and is mandatory to visit (becoming a mandatory destination if\
  \ we are to Europe). \n\nCuriosity about the State of Portugal made me try to note\
  \ if there is an opportunity for the city to be visited, what interesting places\
  \ to see, what sights to photograph, as well as souvenirs that might have to be\
  \ bought to give to the family.\n\nWhen I opened wikipedia, it was interesting to\
  \ read the history of Portugal, Portugal is a European country whose history begins\
  \ in the Middle Ages. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal gained world power\
  \ status in the European Exploration Period with colonies in South America, Africa\
  \ and Asia. Over the next two centuries, Portugal lost a lot of wealth and status\
  \ because the Netherlands, Britain and France surrounded or controlled Portugal's\
  \ trade and territory posts. The military setback began with the eruption of two\
  \ battles: the Battle of Alc\xE1cer Quibir in Morocco in 1578 and the efforts of\
  \ the Spanish fleet to rule the British in 1588. Portugal was a country that co-founded\
  \ the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Organization for Economic Cooperation\
  \ and Development (OECD), and the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) and joined the\
  \ European Union in 1986 \n\nHalf of the \"New World\" once belonged to Portugal,\
  \ through the agreement of Tordesillas in 1494 which essentially gave the Portuguese\
  \ a \"New World\" half including Brazil, Afrikca, and Asia. The Portuguese Empire\
  \ was the first world empire in history and the longest colonialist, almost for\
  \ 6 centuries since annexing Ceuta in 1415 to Macau (China) which was released in\
  \ 1999. \n\nMore than 236 million of the world's population uses Portuguese. Portuguese\
  \ is the official language of 9 countries, namely Porugal, Brazil, Cape Verde, Angola,\
  \ Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Principe, Sao Tome, and Equatorial Guinea. \n\nThe\
  \ next question, as someone who is Muslim, are there many halal dishes in the country?\
  \ I immediately opened some literature and tried halal googling restaurant in a\
  \ big city city in Portugal. The result is a lot of easy instructions for Muslims\
  \ to tour Portugal and eat halal food. \n\nWhen i was googling, I also found 50\
  \ INTERESTING AND UNIQUE FACTS ABOUT PORTUGAL (PORTUGUES), when reading it, it certainly\
  \ makes all of us who read it unable to sleep for it. There are 21 rivers in Portugal\
  \ flowing through rice fields, vineyards and cork, namely the rivers Antua, Argueda,\
  \ Alcoa, Arade, Caia, Coa, Cavado, Douro, Guadiana, Limia, Minho, Mira, Mondego,\
  \ Nabado, Rio Alto, Sado, Tagus, Tamega, Tua, Vouga, and Zezere. \n\nMaybe now is\
  \ the time to work hard, save, and put up an intention if there is a chance to visit\
  \ Europe, so the country that must be visited is Portugal. A lot of people say put\
  \ up ideals as high as the sky, pray and try. God must provide the best way and\
  \ results for the people who have tried hard and prayed tirelessly.\n\nHopefully\
  \ the curiosity and hope that all of these quiz participants might have come true,\
  \ visiting Portugal and returning home with millions of stories which would certainly\
  \ become viral \"Visit Portugal\""
