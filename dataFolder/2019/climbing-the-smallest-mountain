Text: "Climbing Everest has been overdone, and is frankly too much effort. Thus, for\
  \ my first foray into novelty mountaineering I decided to conquer the mighty Mount\
  \ Tenp\u014D, which at an impressive 4.53 meters above sea level is the lowest mountain\
  \ in the world. To put that into perspective, it\u2019s the same height above sea\
  \ level as a particularly short fully grown Tyrannosaurus Rex standing on a beach,\
  \ or 0.0005 times the height of Everest. \n  Mount Tenp\u014D was created in 1831\
  \ from earth dredged from the Ajigawa river. It initially stood 20 meters high.\
  \ Cherry trees were planted on the mountain and shops were set up in the area. With\
  \ this, the site became a popular visitor attraction and gained the attention of\
  \ artists like Utagawa Hiroshige, who is considered the last great master of the\
  \ ukiyo-o tradition. \n  The years took their toll on Mount Tenp\u014D. Part of\
  \ the summit was leveled when artillery were stationed there, and the peak shrunk\
  \ further due to subsidence. This lead to the loss of Mount Tenp\u014D\u2019s mountain\
  \ status when it was removed from topographical maps. Fortunately, protests from\
  \ local residents succeeded in reinstating Mount Tenp\u014D\u2019s mountainhood.\
  \ Today it is marked as a mountain on the topographical maps of the Geographical\
  \ Survey Institute of Japan, the official standard for mountainhood in Japan. \n\
  \  My planned feat of mountaineering drew attention from the moment I set foot in\
  \ Japan. Walking with a friend through airport arrivals we were approached by a\
  \ Japanese film crew who enthusiastically asked us what we planned to do in Japan.\
  \ \u201CWe\u2019ve come to climb the smallest mountain in the world\u201D we replied.\
  \ \n  They looked confused. Our hearts sunk as they failed to recognise the name\
  \ \u201CMount Tenp\u014D\u201D. We added that we intended to warm up by climbing\
  \ Mount Fuji, and at least they recognised that mountain. They told us it was a\
  \ lot bigger than Mount Tenp\u014D, we replied that we knew. \n  We took the metro\
  \ to Mount Tenp\u014D and walked down a wide street lined with chain restaurants\
  \ which mostly served tempura or Japanese Italian food. The bright sunshine contrasted\
  \ with the tired buildings, stylized concrete blocks from the sixties. Relics of\
  \ a now defunct futurism. \n  The entrance to Mount Tenp\u014D is most undignified.\
  \ At the end of the street we had to skirt along the seafront past the Aquarium\
  \ Kaiyukan and Tempozan Ferris Wheel (which stands at 25 times the height of Mount\
  \ Tenp\u014D). Both of these sights were signposted and advertised, unlike Mount\
  \ Tenp\u014D, which seems to have fallen into obscurity since it\u2019s heyday in\
  \ the 1800s. \n  From here we picked our way through the food court of the impeccably\
  \ clean but run down shopping centre which served as the main thoroughfare to Mount\
  \ Tenp\u014D. Outside, a large staircase took us to a brick pathway atop a small\
  \ hill. We paused, unsure if this was Mount Tenp\u014D. If the summit wasn\u2019\
  t marked then how would we tell when we had completed our journey. We walked along\
  \ the brick pathway and found ourselves looking down at an obelisk in the middle\
  \ of a large gravel pit. A signpost in the shape of a small green hill with a smiley\
  \ face and a white sash stated that the obelisk marked the summit of Mount Tenp\u014D\
  . \n  Mount Tenp\u014D wasn\u2019t perfect. It was just there; a patch of ground\
  \ elevated by a somewhat arbitrary accolade. But in this nothingness it seemed to\
  \ obtain some sense of utterly superficial authenticity. Nowadays, authenticity\
  \ is invariably commodified, packaged into easily consumed chunks. Perhaps this\
  \ is why: plain old authenticity is boring. It\u2019s only the narrative of reaching\
  \ Mount Tenp\u014D and it\u2019s niche status which makes it more than a patch of\
  \ gravel.\n   Several months later tragedy struck. My friend sent me an article\
  \ stating that Hiyoriyama, a mountain in the north of Japan which formerly stood\
  \ at 6.05 meters, was flattened to a height of 3 meters by the 2011 tsunami. Hiyoriyama\
  \ was recognised as the lowest mountain in Japan in 2014, following the precedent\
  \ of Mount Tenp\u014D. I had failed to visit the smallest mountain in the world.\
  \ Would it have made any difference if I\u2019d succeeded? I don\u2019t think so."
