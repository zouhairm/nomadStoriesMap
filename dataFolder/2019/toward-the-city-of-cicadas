Text: "I do not remember the exact moment, but between two and five years of age I\
  \ knew that I had cystic fibrosis, and that I would not reach the age of 18. With\
  \ my life marked by a very short destiny, I always lived against time, searching\
  \ for answers before an imminent end. When I met my ex-girlfriend, through the internet,\
  \ I knew that even if I died, I wanted to spend my short life with her, and although\
  \ she lived in California, USA, and I live in Chihuahua, Mexico, I was determined\
  \ to meet her even if I put her at risk my life.\n\nMy illness includes problems\
  \ in the lungs, the pancreas and I also had many allergies, without having had a\
  \ normal schooling and without a job, living with the care of my family, I was the\
  \ worst candidate to be accepted in the USA. But when 2014 came and I had three\
  \ years of long-distance courtship, my girlfriend had an incredible idea: that I\
  \ could study English at a school in California, and have a Student Visa, that would\
  \ take me to travel to California.\n\nA miracle happened: as soon as I was a few\
  \ steps away from the visa interview, I thought destiny would act, that only God\
  \ could help us, and it was. I was accepted with no more questions than the basic\
  \ ones, and in five minutes I went from being a young Mexican without a visa, to\
  \ be an international student with an incredible journey waiting. Since my family\
  \ don\u2019t have visa, they had to let me go on my first trip alone, in a Greyhound\
  \ bus, through all the southern states of the United States.\n\nOne morning, I would\
  \ get on the truck that would take me to a 27-hour road trip, walking through the\
  \ deserts of Texas bathed in moonlight, until I came to a station in Phoenix, Arizona,\
  \ where there were people from all over the world. Looking at the whole world, all\
  \ my life of limitations was fading right there. At every moment of the trip, I\
  \ left that tragic destiny, which I had had since I was a child, and which limited\
  \ me to a life of care and confinement. My body, in an act of piety, allowed me\
  \ to reach Coachella, California, the city where my love lived.\n\nNow I had an\
  \ appointment with the English school E.C. Los Angeles, in Santa Monica, California,\
  \ in a city that had watched movies, but never imagined visiting it and being the\
  \ new student of a prestigious school. My initial feeling was of pity, because I\
  \ did not speak almost English. But my experience was different, I was not only\
  \ a student valued by my colleagues, but in a week I had new friends from many countries,\
  \ and I came to check that there were no real differences between these people,\
  \ other human beings like me, winning the certificate of Intermediate English and\
  \ speaking better English.\n\nMy life with my girlfriend and her family was full\
  \ of emotions, to discover my own person through experiences never before lived,\
  \ watching the fireworks in Disneyland, in a perfect night of the hand of my girlfriend,\
  \ and other evenings walking together, listening to the singing of the cicadas,\
  \ many in the hot parks, in the city surrounded by palm trees and deserts, home\
  \ of my new myself, that was born in the afternoons of the hot sun, nights of cicadas,\
  \ when my new life began in the company of the woman who marked my life, and gave\
  \ me a new opportunity to live, to face the world and its challenges.\n\nOn that\
  \ wonderful journey of two months, which marked my destiny years ago, I learned\
  \ two things: never give up, even if you are afraid, you can still get it; and the\
  \ second, that living or dying has no meaning in itself, the important thing is\
  \ motivation, the reason to travel, to find the meaning of our life, and for me\
  \ that motivation was love: the best engine to find myself, and find the answers\
  \ to everything, and discover the miracle of living."
