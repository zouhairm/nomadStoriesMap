Text: "Vietnam \u2013 A perfect blend of \u201CAncient Modern\u201D\nImagine this\
  \ scenario where you get to explore a place which resembled your grandmother\u2019\
  s description of her childhood times, perfectly blended with this modern era. It\
  \ is just like that wonderful visual cocktail this country is all about. Vietnam!\
  \ Oh boy! Visited twice past two years and still feel like the place has this \u201C\
  forever calling\u201D which does not seem to take a stop! \nI would like to start\
  \ this journey by introducing to this unique currency system in Vietnam. Vietnamese\
  \ dong is supposed to be one of the world\u2019s highest denominated country. Imagine\
  \ paying 2 lakhs dong for a day\u2019s accommodation which just amounts to 8 dollars.\
  \ It\u2019s surprising to see everybody transacting in lakhs, billions and millions,\
  \ making you feel tremendously rich without really shedding a lot of money from\
  \ your pocket. \nHanoi, the capital city of Vietnam and the second largest city\
  \ in terms of population, is known for it\u2019s laid back feel where everything\
  \ around is moving at its own pace basking in every facet of what this city has\
  \ to offer.  Hoan Kiem lake acts as a beautiful central reflection of the entire\
  \ city. The old quarter streets are buzzing with hostels, cafes and food street\
  \ stalls stretching all the way long. If you are a foodie, this city will never\
  \ fail to satisfy your taste buds. Mostly dominated by street food culture, the\
  \ stalls have these tiny stools/chairs for seating which is very surprising and\
  \ challenging at the same time, as they are not as comforting as the food but the\
  \ food is way too good to make you forget about everything else.\n Hostels and tour\
  \ operators provide packages to nearby breathtaking attractions. One of them being\
  \ Halong Bay, around 3-hour drive from Hanoi. The bay is one of the most beautiful\
  \ natural wonder, dotted with around 1600 limestone islands. It was also declared\
  \ as UNESCO world heritage site in 1994. The journey begins with boarding a junk\
  \ boat/ship which takes you to this world filled with water bodies surrounded with\
  \ limestones and natural caves. The tour packages also cover a lot of fun and exciting\
  \ activities like trekking, kayaking and cave exploration sessions. So yes! It\u2019\
  s a place where your experience would be way ahead of your expense and it doesn\u2019\
  t look like its catching up ever! There is also a birds-eye view of Halong Bay,\
  \ the access to which actually is from a small building entrance in Halong city\
  \ followed by a slightly tricky trek to the top.\nAnother beautiful scenic landscape\
  \ is Tam Coc which is a part of Ninh Binh province. Tam Coc offers a continuous\
  \ stretch of the stream of water surrounded by mountains and sculptures all around.\
  \ There is a breathtaking 2-hour long boat ride which is run continuously by a single\
  \ local person, per boat, rowing the boat with their feet. One of the most interesting\
  \ places is King Kong island, where the movie King Kong was shot and that set up\
  \ is still retained making you feel like you are a part of the movie.\nComing back\
  \ to Hanoi, the city has this interesting hostel life encouraging all the tourists\
  \ from different parts of the world to have a chance to bond and connect. Trust\
  \ me even if there is a sight of not so - social scenes between them in the morning,\
  \ as the sun goes down and the stars come up, all the space seems to vanish and\
  \ suddenly everyone around is a \u201CSocial Party Animal\u201D. One of the interesting\
  \ parts of the nightlife is the free drinks offered in every hostel and engagement\
  \ activities for their guests, promoting one of the most unique hostel experiences\
  \ one could ever ask for. Laughing gas is also one of the hidden but not so hidden\
  \ side of their nightlife. \nThe only deadly experience as a tourist was the crazy\
  \ amount of traffic and to see the way people rode their bikes, which almost looked\
  \ like I was taking a step closer to the doors of death, but the country has ended\
  \ all its war way-way long back and it just gives you nothing but a killer experience\
  \ nowadays!"
