Text: "I\u2019m sitting on the floor -- naked -- in the middle of a bath house. Holding\
  \ my breath, I squeeze my eyes shut as cold water is poured over my head. Although\
  \ I\u2019m trying to enjoy the experience of the hammam, all I can think about is\
  \ not swallowing any of the water or else I\u2019ll be stuck on the toilet for the\
  \ rest of the trip. \n\nWhen I daydreamed about my post-college graduation trip\
  \ to Morocco, I envisioned wandering through marketplaces wearing white flowy pants\
  \ that somehow never got dirty. I imagined myself riding a camel and having a colorful\
  \ scarf wrapped around my face like every tourist on Instagram. Never in a million\
  \ years did I think I would have an old Moroccan woman scrub me till I was bright\
  \ pink. \n\nThe opportunity to participate in the hammam came up after a day of\
  \ exploring and bargain hunting at Marrakech\u2019s Jema El Fna Medina. Sick of\
  \ the staged belly dancing dinners and constant pit stops at the \u201CUnited States\
  \ Embassy\u201D of McDonalds, I jumped at the chance to participate in one of these\
  \ ritual baths: I was tired of seeing Morocco through tourist-colored glasses. \n\
  \nAn elderly Moroccan women thrusted a black mitten into my hands the minute we\
  \ arrived at the bathhouse. Immediately stripping down to just bathing suit bottoms,\
  \ our group\u2019s nervous giggles echoed off the walls. The same woman assessed\
  \ each girl in my group; she eyed me, motioned me over with her finger, and walked\
  \ into the next room. Careful not to slip and fall from the wet tile, I followed\
  \ her away from the other girls to what I noticed was the room where all the local\
  \ women were congregated. \n\nSitting on the cold floor, the feeling of vulnerability\
  \ immediately washed over me. Although all the women were minding their own business,\
  \ I felt hyper-aware of how I was the only foreigner. A splash of cold water interrupted\
  \ me and my self consciousness: sputtering out the water, I looked up and saw the\
  \ old woman grinning from ear to ear. She threw water on me again and ripped travel\
  \ shampoo packets with her teeth. Squirting the shampoo on my head, she began to\
  \ massage my scalp. \n\nFor what seemed like an eternity, the woman scrubbed every\
  \ part (and I mean, every part) of my body. Loud laughter replaced the nervous giggles\
  \ as the woman sporadically threw cold water at me. At the end of the hammam, I\
  \ felt the need to somehow thank her even though no words were exchanged. As I leaned\
  \ in for a hug, water returned my embrace. She smiled."
