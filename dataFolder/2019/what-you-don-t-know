Text: "People are extremely happy, but we do have a darkseid. Experience brazil as\
  \ a tourist is really hard, people think you're rich and you are already in danger.\
  \ We have museums and sculptures, beaches and forests beautiful, but people only\
  \ they care for the tourists to come and spend money. Rio de Janeiro beautiful place,\
  \ incredible beaches, each corner full of happiness, but don't be a fool, you can\
  \ be robbed there so easily, I went to London once, the safe place I ever been,\
  \ brazil in the other hand is not. This is a guide for you tourist, be careful,\
  \ be safe. This could be funny, but is not, I love my country and my city S\xE3\
  o Paulo, we have the center called Pra\xE7a da S\xE9, is beautiful with a church\
  \ in the middle, our subway, and robberies, that place is really full of criminals,\
  \ I would say come with a spare phone to take photos, never put your stuff on easy\
  \ pockets, wear your bag in front of your body, I really don't want paint my country\
  \ as this, but is the truth, and I'm tired to see people get robbed or hurt here.\
  \ I want people to be safe. So let's talk about THE NIGHT in S\xE3o Paulo, man we\
  \ have the bests clubs, Rua Augusta one side full of clothes stores and the other\
  \ ballads each one better than other, eclectic, drinks, if you're here you need\
  \ to drink caipirinha, there is one that is my favorite BLITZ, it has games, it\
  \ has music, and food. Another one TOKIO, it has karaoke is awesome, and SELVA not\
  \ like those but I like very much, and 1007 two floors so variety of music, and\
  \ you know we talk about brazil, we have a different kind of funk that one that\
  \ makes your booty work. Now let's talk about museums Oscar Niemeyer, Lina Bobardi,\
  \ I'm a designer/illustrator do I love this places, we have BECO DO BATMAN, a site\
  \ with several illustrations, you can enjoy a peacock in the wall, so many styles\
  \ of drawings, I love the architecture of this city PAULISTA AVENUE, so many buildings,\
  \ and MASP created by Lina Bobardi tree floors of expositions, and the last floor\
  \ with the CAVALETE DE VIDRO, with Portinari, Tarsila, Picasso, Monet, all of them\
  \ in one place. And we have the Sesc (servi\xE7o social do com\xE9rcio/social service\
  \ of commerce) places you can co to eat, relax see some expositions I love this\
  \ place so much. Anyway you can enjoy brazil, Brazilians are funny, everyone has\
  \ a bad day, but we always have some laughs to share. Never forget the carnival,\
  \ in March, schools of samba you can't miss this really. Last but not least, every\
  \ country has it's dark side, but if you don't go because you are afraid, you won't\
  \ go anywhere. Have fun with safety, remember never have your phone at sight, if\
  \ you have a professional camera always wear the strap, if you know how to handle\
  \ a knife I really recommend. Overall enjoy the dance, the night, the museums and\
  \ places."
