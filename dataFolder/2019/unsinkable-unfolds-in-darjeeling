Text: "Traveling is fun, traveling is relaxing, traveling is living a life. Traveling\
  \ definition is beyond words and feeling, it is the most exciting and pleasing thing\
  \ that one can ever undertake. In these twenty years of my life, I have been few\
  \ places and has covered a very small portion of total land in the earth and the\
  \ dream is increasing the portion is continuing.\nDarjeeling is a small town in\
  \ India lying in the lap of hills and amazing landscapes of hilly regions with charming\
  \ greenery and tea garden. About 2000 meters higher than sea level, it is one of\
  \ the most visited in India historically famous for Darjeeling Himalayan railways\
  \ which lies in the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Peace Pagoda, Ghum Monastery, and\
  \ Tenzing Rock are some other major attractions of beautiful city Darjeeling.\n\
  It just took one email to plan a trip of Darjeeling, I still thank my friend who\
  \ lives in Darjeeling for that email and invitation. It is about 5-hour drive from\
  \ my Kerkha, a small village town in eastern part of Nepal. The day was windy and\
  \ cold and I made sudden plan to go Darjeeling, my cousin thought I was crazy to\
  \ plan suddenly in very giggly weather like that but he was not excited and crazy\
  \ as like me, crazy about traveling and exploring things and people. I packed my\
  \ north face bag, wore my boots and trek suits with a woolen jacket in my hand and\
  \ left my apartment to see Darjeeling. I was feeling multiple things at the same\
  \ time, feeling of excitements, feelings of freedom and yes of course, craziness.\
  \ \nMy trip started from the local bus of Nepal, with my camera on a neck and music\
  \ player on my ears, I crumbled that 2 hours until  I finally stepped at Mechi River\
  \ Bridge which connects Nepal and India. Without any obstruct from border force\
  \ I entered India, that\u2019s the beauty of friendship and an open border between\
  \ Nepal and India. And I got into a small minibus which will take me to Darjeeling.\
  \ I was lucky to have the window seat because I love to see amazing mountains, small\
  \ huts and green tea garden from the window, I can see such beauties for several\
  \ hours, without being monotonous. The beautiful mountains, Buddhists architectures,\
  \ blue sky and the little fog is the best combination that exists in Darjeeling.\
  \  The beautiful Ghum Monastery is on the way to main Darjeeling area. I personally\
  \ think that it was made there for a purpose, it stands there so that every visitors\
  \ to Darjeeling stops there and wonders about that, wonders and click a selfie or\
  \ photograph inside and outside the surroundings, I did that too. I took out my\
  \ camera and clicked some pictures for my travel diary. It was getting darker as\
  \ sun was preparing to dissolve in the horizon, that pale yellow round structure\
  \ of sun adds more excitements to every single time. Capturing some photos from\
  \ the hill that Ghum Monastery stands legit made me feel like I am a photographer\
  \ and explorer, made for this, made for something more like this. I got dissolved\
  \ the beauty of nature and on my own cherish until my phone ranged, I nearly forgot\
  \ that I had a friend waiting to host me, but that was not my fault to be honest\
  \ because it is more than fair that everyone lost themselves and feel the wonderful\
  \ atmosphere when they are in Darjeeling. \nI answered her phone call and conclude\
  \ the conversation that I will meet her in half an hour. I placed my camera inside\
  \ my bag and walk towards the bus stop as I need to be at my friend\u2019s house\
  \ soon because she has advised me that Darjeeling transportation does not run till\
  \ late hours. Just after 20 minutes of traveling in a cab through to small narrow\
  \ road with small traditional home and temples, I finally managed to rest in a small\
  \ but very beautiful house of my friend. I was tired and hungry so that pushed me\
  \ to sleep straight after dinner, we planned to visit whole Darjeeling the next\
  \ day."
