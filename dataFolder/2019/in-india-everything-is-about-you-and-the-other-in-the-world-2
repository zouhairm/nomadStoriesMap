Text: "Strong smells. A smoke that would not stop me from scratching my eye until\
  \ we got to the little hotel that I had booked through the internet. When my friend\
  \ and I arrived at New Delhi Airport we could already feel the Masala that would\
  \ be part of our life in the next 23 days by different regions of India. We had\
  \ already arranged a shuttle service to accompany us. We opted for this expensive\
  \ alternative - paid in dollars, because our time was short to visit the cities\
  \ we wanted. Then, just outside Indira Gandhi, Ravi was waiting for us. I confess\
  \ that I'm not sure if Ravi was the name of our first driver. But, I also remember\
  \ Sandeep, our last driver and the one who stayed with us the longest time. I have\
  \ him added on my Facebook. Ok. Well, the traffic was chaotic and there was that\
  \ mixture of car carburetor with incense that penetrated the nose and lung or, perhaps,\
  \ the Masala, a mixture of spices with a unique flavour used in indian cuisine.\
  \ As we already had the car, we rarely took the famous Tuk-Tuk, which is an alternative\
  \ to gain time on the streets and also inhale all smells and pollution!\n\nThe trade\
  \ takes all over Paharganj, the neighborhood where we stayed the first two nights\
  \ in capital before visit the famous Taj Mahal , in Agra. Delhi is a chaos with\
  \ places of peace, temples. Not to mention the thousands of smiling children around\
  \ the city playing in the streets and asking for money. There is a lot of trash\
  \ and misery but everyone is always with a smile on face. The first impression of\
  \ the hotel I chose to stay as soon as we arrived was not good, but the price paid\
  \ off and had a lot of shops to buy souvenirs. Later I understood that the experience\
  \ was not just about that.\n\nOne particularity that should be remembered is that\
  \ many tourist spots in India still have those traditional seats with holes in the\
  \ ground as a bathroom. In some places there are no \"western\" toilets. In fact,\
  \ some hotels we stayed had both options. And let's just say we were not very happy\
  \ in our choices. Judging from the pictures, some of them look like real Indian\
  \ palaces, but dirty. The problem was always the rubbish around, doves on the windowsill,\
  \ noise...People loved to honk their horns! We found a comfortable accommodation\
  \ next to Delhi airport on a route of passage we made there. However, this was not\
  \ an option, it was our only choice because we missed a flight even while we were\
  \ inside the airport waiting for the departure time! I still don\u2019t know how\
  \ this happened but I learned from India that calm is the best way to deal with\
  \ everything. Also, the main thing is always have a smile on your face. \n\nI was\
  \ impressed by the ability of them to live with a constant joy! The country of Gandhi\
  \ is full of contrasts and traditions, it has the Taj Mahal and the Golden Temple\
  \ made with gold, on the other hand, a lot of poor people. During the trip, Sandeep\
  \ asked us if we were single and I thought it was a invasive question. I figured\
  \ out people love to talk, to ask! After a while I got used to it. I guess they\
  \ mostly are interested in exchange experiences.\n\nAfter our stay among cows, temples,\
  \ images of gods everywhere, and a small spiritual retreat focused on meditation...Surprise!\
  \ A few hours before our flight back to Brazil, the chaos took over the peace, at\
  \ the airport, again! They were not letting us dispatch our luggage because it exceeded\
  \ the limit on the domestic route once we had a stop in Bombay. We spent almost\
  \ an hour arguing with about five different smiling people who never knew what had\
  \ been said before to explain the situation. Finally, after the discussion, we were\
  \ free to move on! I realized that they deal with problems in a different way, with\
  \ much more sympathy and resilience. These both characteristics allowed me to awake\
  \ pure feelings of empathy and individual discoveries."
