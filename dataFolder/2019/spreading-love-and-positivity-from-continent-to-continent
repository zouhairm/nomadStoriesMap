Text: "Growing up in a Modern Orthodox Jewish household, I had always been interested\
  \ in exploring religions outside of my own. Attending public school in New York\
  \ had introduced me to a sense of diversity that I craved to know more about, and\
  \ encouraged me to want to learn about other religions. With this attitude in mind,\
  \ I decided to travel and volunteer in Sri Lanka, a country thousands of kilometers\
  \ away from home, where I knew I would finally have all my questions answered. \n\
  From the moment I landed in Sri Lanka, I was greeted by my volunteer coordinator,\
  \ who welcomed me with a toothless smile, as well as my fellow volunteers. The volunteers\
  \ were from all over the world, but mostly France, Belgium, and China. We would\
  \ spend hours sharing stories about our cities together, teasing each other in our\
  \ native language, and sharing our favorite music and trending songs from our countries.\
  \ We bonded to such an extent, that we even made plans to volunteer together over\
  \ the summer of 2018 in Peru.\n After getting comfortable with my surroundings in\
  \ Sri Lanka, I was ready to begin volunteering. The volunteers had been scattered\
  \ all across Sri Lanka. Some working with turtle conservation, others renovating\
  \ temples, or working at the local disabled home. My job was to teach English and\
  \ mathematics to Monks in the morning, and then work with local village kids, in\
  \ the afternoon. I would build a schedule for them, in which we would start our\
  \ day by singing American nursery rhymes, and then move on to ABC\u2019s and shapes.\
  \  The village kids would brighten up my smile and lighten my eyes every second\
  \ they would speak to me, and the monks were so eager to learn. They were always\
  \ filled up with energy and excitement, the minute they saw that I would pick up\
  \ a piece of chalk to write on the blackboard. My last day in Sri Lanka was not\
  \ easy for me at all. I had just began packing my things and saying my last goodbyes\
  \ to the teachers at the preschool, when Dhamikke, one of the 4 year-old students,\
  \ came running into my arms. I remember his bright, big eyes, looking into mine\
  \ as he let out a beautiful toothless smile. He had never spoken a word to me, but\
  \ his expression had been enough for me to never forget. That was the moment I realized,\
  \ I had come to Sri Lanka because I wanted to experience a third- world country,\
  \ and I wanted to have an affect on the people by sharing my love, but in the end,\
  \ they were the ones who had affected me. \nWe have a lot to learn from the Sri\
  \ Lankan people. The mothers\u2019 of the village kids had opened up to me, and\
  \ shared with me the hardships they experience at home. The Sri Lankan people cannot\
  \ drink water safely from the faucet, without knowing there is a chance they may\
  \ get infected by a poisonous disease. Their homes are not lavish, with nothing\
  \ but a small roof over their heads. When you look at their happiness, you begin\
  \ to realize that none of it matters. They feel lucky to be able to wake up every\
  \ morning feeling healthy. When I compare it to life back here, I realize that we\
  \ are living life the wrong way completely. People who have everything in the world,\
  \ from the most expensive cars, to the biggest home, or even to an average middle\
  \ class family who have food in their fridge, will always find something to complain\
  \ about. If we take the time to care for one another, and focus on what we DO have,\
  \ like the Sri Lankan people, our lives will change for the better. I truly hope\
  \ that anyone, who has the opportunity to volunteer in a 3rd world country should\
  \ go do it."
