Text: "\u201CYou won\u2019t see much tonight, Senorita.\u201D    We\u2019d been plodding\
  \ through miles of sand in the pitch-black for two hours.  Waves crashed against\
  \ the shore as I repeatedly stumbled over sand dunes before getting back up, brushing\
  \ myself off and soldiering on.  \n\n\u201CThis might be my only chance to visit\
  \ Costa Rica,\u201D I explained, shaking sand out of my hair.   \u201CSeeing a turtle\
  \ lay her eggs would be a once in a lifetime experience.\u201D\n\n\u201CNot for\
  \ me, Senorita,\u201D he smirked.  \n\nI\u2019d met Nicolas on the beach that afternoon.\
  \ He was proud to be one of the local villagers selected to receive a government\
  \ permit to take tourists on nightly excursions to spot nesting sea turtles.  We\
  \ had chatted and he had been very realistic that chances were slim we\u2019d find\
  \ a turtle that night. \u201CHere in the North Caribbean, the Leatherbacks nest\
  \ from March to May, the Loggerheads from July to October.   You\u2019ve come at\
  \ the wrong time.\u201D\n\n I persisted, and he jumped at the chance to earn some\
  \ off-season income putting his guiding license to work.  Witnessing nesting turtles\
  \ had always been a dream of mine.  What better place to fulfil that dream than\
  \ the village of Tortuguero \u2013  literally meaning Land of the Turtles? \n\n\u201C\
  Remind me why we can\u2019t we use a flashlight?\u201D I complained, as I tumbled\
  \ down another dune, floundering on my back like a flailing turtle.  \n\n\u201C\
  The white light will scare the turtles away,\u201D Nicolas explained.  He clicked\
  \ a button and a dim red light lit our way. \u201CThey are less disturbed by longer\
  \ wavelengths, like the colour red.\u201D \n\nHis face froze and he inhaled sharply.\
  \  \u201CTortuga!\u201D Nicolas whispered reverently, pointing at the shoreline.\
  \ \n\nAn outline of a giant turtle appeared in the darkness, shuffling stoically\
  \ toward the dunes.    We\u2019d hit off-season paydirt.\n  \n \u201CShe\u2019s\
  \ too late.\u201D  Nicolas said solemnly. \u201CShe\u2019s missed her prime.\u201D\
  \ \n\nHow often had I heard that?  As someone who chose to backpack the world throughout\
  \ my twenties, alternating trips with university semesters, well-meaning relatives,\
  \ friends and even strangers were constantly placing judgements. \n\u201CYou\u2019\
  ll never find a husband.\" \n\"It\u2019ll be too late to have children.\"\n\"You\
  \ can\u2019t travel if you want an established career.\u201D  \n\nWatching that\
  \ turtle mama plod through the sand with determination, you could tell she could\
  \ care less about prescribed deadlines.  Fireflies danced around her, cheering her\
  \ on, as she persisted in digging that hole with her weathered flippers. She had\
  \ this.  This night was hers.   \n\nAfter she dug a crater for her large body to\
  \ rest, her back flippers shovelled a smaller hole to catch her eggs.   \n\n\"She\
  \ has entered a trance-like state,\u201D Nicolas explained.  \u201CShe is more difficult\
  \ to disturb now that she has begun the process.\u201D\n\nLightning cracked above\
  \ us, lighting up her straining torso in brief flashes.   \n\n\u201COh look \u2013\
  \ the poor girl\u2019s crying.\u201D  Tears flowed down her leathery skin\u2013\
  \ was she reflecting on the hatchlings she\u2019d never get to meet? \n\n Nicolas\
  \ shook his head.   \u201CShe is secreting salt from the sea water, to restore proper\
  \ balance in her body.  All living creatures need balance.\u201D\n\nI crouched closer,\
  \ witnessing the eggs pour from her body and plop-plop into the hole.  Dozens spilled\
  \ out, each ping-pong-ball-sized egg bringing the promise of potential new life\
  \ in the months to come.  The scene was so beautiful my eyes welled up with some\
  \ turtle tears of my own.\nWhen she finished laying her eggs, she used her flippers\
  \ to fling sand back over her nest to camouflage it from predators.  \n\n\u201C\
  Some prehistoric instinct tells her to abandon her comfortable home to migrate;\
  \ to rely on Earth\u2019s magnetic field to find her way back to the same beach\
  \ where she was born to lay her own eggs.\u201D Nicolas explained.  \u201CShe follows\
  \ her internal compass that steers her across the ocean to find where she belongs,\
  \ when the time is right.\u201D \n\nHaving sufficiently stirred up enough sand to\
  \ mask her nest, the mama turtle plodded back toward the surf and slowly and steadily\
  \ slipped quietly into the sea without a backward glance.  \n\nI travelled to Tortuguero\
  \ in the hopes of finding a sea turtle laying her eggs against all odds. I didn\u2019\
  t expect that in finding her, I\u2019d find restored confidence in myself."
