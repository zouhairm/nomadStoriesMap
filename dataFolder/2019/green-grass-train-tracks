Text: "\u201CArbeit Macht Frei\u201D the dark wrought iron gate greeted us, \u201C\
  Work Sets You Free.\u201D It is odd to walk through Auschwitz on a bright summer\
  \ day. The sky is a vivid blue and young grass covers the ground. There are even\
  \ small yellow flowers budding between the train tracks. Looking at the green open\
  \ field you could forget for a moment that those same tracks brought a million people\
  \ to their deaths. \nI had imagined what it would feel like to be here. I pictured\
  \ it hard, and gray, and cold. So I'm almost angry at the sun; like it is intentionally\
  \ trying to beautify the monstrous and hide the true evil of this place. \n\nOur\
  \ guide continues the tour as I try to take it all in, to give everything the proper\
  \ weight and understanding, to imagine what it once was.\n\u201CAnd here slept the\
  \ kitchen workers,\u201D says the guide pointing at a small wooden barracks. \u201C\
  Are you sure?\u201D I ask, \u201Cis this the only one?\u201D \nShe nods. It seems\
  \ so nondescript, just like all the others. I follow the group inside and take a\
  \ deep breath before running my fingers along the faded wooden beam that holds up\
  \ the top bunk. \n\nThis is where she slept. \n\nAnd sadly, that is all I know.\
  \  As a child, I never gave much thought to the odd blue number tattooed on her\
  \ wrinkly skin. And she never talked about it. Not to her own children, and definitely\
  \ not to us. I was still too young to truly grasp her story when she died, and now\
  \ I wish I knew it. I wish I could sit with her and understand what she went through,\
  \ how she survived, what kept her going? How did it change her? \n\nMaybe that's\
  \ why I came here, to the place she wanted to forget. \nMy father didn't want me\
  \ to take the trip, and I couldn't explain why but I knew I needed to go. I Needed\
  \ to see for myself. To reconnect to a woman I loved but never truly knew. \n\n\
  On the way out of the museum, a stark black plaque with bold white letters demands\
  \ our attention: \u201CThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat\
  \ it.\u201D I still don\u2019t know much about my grandmother\u2019s past, but here\
  \ I could walk through it. And I hope this haunting piece of history remains preserved\
  \ for many years to come so that all of us, from every nation and religion, can\
  \ stand in the place that is synonymous with death\u2014where now the green grass\
  \ grows\u2014and remember."
