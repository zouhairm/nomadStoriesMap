Text: "-what\u2019s your name?\n+ my name is Atefeh. You can call me Ati.\n-Nice!\
  \ Do you know Ati means heart in the Indonesian language?\n+really?\n-yes! Welcome\
  \ to Indonesia, Ati!\nSo, every time I had put my hand on my heart for introducing\
  \ myself, I am Heart, a throbbing heart!\nActually, I have more than one name in\
  \ Indonesia! I had applied for traditional dance program and I came to Indonesia\
  \ for learning traditional dance (web Developer, writer, and dancer!). my classmates\
  \ and teachers called me Atifa, Afete, and sometimes nothing! Just one Indonesian\
  \ man who couldn\u2019t speak English always called me correctly, Atefeh!\nOne day\
  \ I just rode my friend\u2019s motorbike for 10 minutes! I felt I was flying. I\
  \ decided to buy a scooter! I searched and searched and searched. I found Blue Sky\
  \ and I bought it. Next day I woke up in the hospital! A stormy beginning! I felt\
  \ alone and sad as a loser! I just listened to a podcast about discovery of Antarctic.\
  \ It was a story about a solo traveler, exactly I needed it and I felt better! I\
  \ felt I am as strong as a solo traveler and I called myself Solo Girl!\nI got better\
  \ and I went around cities, most people, especially grandmas, embraced me and called\
  \ me Cantik (it means beautiful) and they suggested that I get married in Indonesia!\n\
  I decided to travel throughout Indonesia to find my favorite man (just kidding)!\
  \ I desired traveling but I scared to travel alone. My friend suggested joining\
  \ Couchsurfing. I joined and sent a request to stay at a host in Borobudur and she\
  \ accepted me immediately. I was excited because I had started my solo traveling\
  \ and I stayed in an orphanage that Lina managed it. I was happy because I stayed\
  \ in the house with more than 30 kids who called me miss! I felt they are my family!\
  \ I felt Indonesia is my home!\nI went around my new home! I Visited cities on Java\
  \ island and I found new friends. I asked them about other islands. They introduce\
  \ me Sumatra and special region, Aceh! I liked Sumatra but I wasn\u2019t interested\
  \ to visit Aceh! But many people thought my name is Aceh and every time I remembered\
  \ that I didn\u2019t like it! But I loved Java Island!\nI traveled around Java island.\
  \ I took 9 days trip to west java. I bought a train ticket and I prepared my backpack.\
  \ I was stressful but when I sat next to the young man on the train and We spoke\
  \ about everything and watched unforgettable views of farms and jungles I got relaxed.\
  \ He was a gentleman. He helped me to find direction in big Jakarta. I surprised\
  \ that he called me Mo! Actually, my last name is Mohib and maybe he would like\
  \ to be polite and friendly.\nI had many names and It is too exciting that we meet\
  \ a person in other countries who have our name! it happened for me! A family hosted\
  \ me in west java. They had two girls. Their names weren\u2019t Ati, Atefeh, Atifa,\
  \ Afete, Aceh, and\u2026! But they had 6 cats and one of them was Mo-Mo! It was\
  \ a friendly cat. When I was sick it came to my room and watched me. I am happy\
  \ we had the same name and I miss Mo-Mo. \nI love all of my names because I love\
  \ who called me them. I am curious about my next names and I will find them on my\
  \ next trips\u2026\nHow about you? How many names do you have?"
