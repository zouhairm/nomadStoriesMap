Text: "Seeing the islands from above the sky provides you the mesmerising experience.\
  \ The green patches of water surrounded by blue waves in the middle of the sea look\
  \ extremely miraculous. Maldives!\nYes I am talking about one of the world\u2019\
  s most beautiful beaches in Maldives. It is basically a South Asian island country,\
  \ located in Indian Ocean and situated in the Arabian Sea. The travelling experience\
  \ began right after the plane landed on runway, built on the island reef. It looked\
  \ like plane was diving on surface of Indian Ocean from the blue sky. Velana International\
  \ airport also called as Male International Airport is the main doorway for the\
  \ sightseers. The interesting part of Male Airport is that it is not built inside\
  \ the city; instead it is situated on the Hulhule Island in the North Male Atoll.\
  \ So when tourists step out from the airport, the yachts are ready to welcome them\
  \ in the deep sea. The ships and yachts take the tourists to their hotels and resorts.\
  \ \nFamous hotels have made their resorts in Male. Some of them are Four Seasons,\
  \ Sun Aqua Vilu Reef, Sheraton and Bandos. The  tourists can make online reservations\
  \ in their favourite resorts through tripadvisor.com. The main attractions for tourists\
  \ in Maldives are beaches, islands and water sports. \nWe had a day tour at 4 star\
  \ resort called Cinnamon Dhonveli. The resort staff had a tradition to greet the\
  \ vacationers with welcome drinks like apple or pineapple juices along with fruit\
  \ chunks. Moreover, they provided a paper map of whole resort to facilitate the\
  \ tourists. In addition, they can enjoy both indoor and outdoor games like table\
  \ tennis, badminton and basketball. I really enjoyed playing games with my soul\
  \ mate as it was our first experience of doing sports together. A bar along with\
  \ souvenir shop was also located inside the resort. Several types of drinks were\
  \ available and one can taste different flavours while enjoying sea views. The resort\
  \ consisted of two types of swimming pools; the small one for kids and the big one\
  \ for adults. Finally the food served in resort was scrumptious. Besides Maldives\
  \ specialties, other types of victuals were also dished up. Maldives specialties\
  \ include sweet and sour fish, Maldivian curry and tuna fish. Furthermore, customised\
  \ salad and pasta bars were also available. \nWater sports add thrilling and adventurous\
  \ flavour in the vacations, but one has to be very daring and audacious. For those,\
  \ who are aware of swimming are more able to enjoy and play in the abyssal sea than\
  \ those of non-swimmers. Aquatic life is completely different from normal life.\
  \ One should be ready to experience life under water with full peace of mind.\n\
  Most popular water sports in Maldives are jet skiing, canoeing, banana boat, seaplanes,\
  \ snorkelling, sailing and water skiing. Based on my personal experience, I did\
  \ jet skiing, canoeing, banana boat and snorkelling with my other half. All of these\
  \ were amazing and fabulous. Though, snorkelling was the most thrilling experience.\
  \ It provides an opportunity of seeing the aquatic life, very closely. The tourists\
  \ can actually discover the marine life. As both us were unaware of swimming, so\
  \ we were guided by a professional swimmer in the sea along with the life jackets.\
  \ \n\nLeaving thy body into the deep \nLetting the waves direct it\nSeeing the black,\
  \ blue, silver, grey\nFishes in motion\nStrengthens thy notions\nIn God\u2019s miracles\
  \ & marvel \n\nWith regards to shopping, one cannot enjoy the classy buying as tourists\
  \ will hardly find a single brand. They usually import clothes and other stuff from\
  \ Thailand and China. The whole economy of Maldives is based on tourism. Mostly,\
  \ dollar is used as currency along with Rufiyaa (local currency). It consists of\
  \ nearly 1200 sandy beaches. According to World Bank, it is considered as least\
  \ developed country. While on our visit to Male city, we had experienced it too\
  \ that the city was majorly comprised of small streets with poor waste management\
  \ system. English is commonly used to verbally communicate with other people, in\
  \ Maldives along with its native language. \nThe beauty of Maldives is enhanced\
  \ through the colourful water of its beaches and atolls. For globetrotters, it is\
  \ considered as tropical paradise."
