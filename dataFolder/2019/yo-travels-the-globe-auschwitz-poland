Text: "Poland saves a big and important history about Jewish extermination along world\
  \ war II, located in Auschwitz, Poland. \n\nAuschwitz (1940-1945) is a city located\
  \ in the Northern Poland. It was winter and too cold as the Auschwitz tour is mostly\
  \ in outside the room, so be ready with your winter stuff and you can still enjoy\
  \ every part of it.  To get in to the Auschwitz, you can open the official website\
  \ but visitors usually run out the ticket. no worries! There are some tour agency\
  \ that provide entrance ticket to the Auschwitz + tour guide+ transportation from\
  \ Krak\xF3w (The Price around 100 PLN). The group of tour usually consists of 20-30\
  \ people and there is a headseat therefore we can hear the tour-guide clearly. You\
  \ can also go buying the ticket without tour guide but there is only a little explanation\
  \ written about it. To get full  and clear informations, you are put forward to\
  \ book the ticket and tour guide.\n\nBefore you come, better to watch some movie\
  \ related to this, so you will understand the history. Despite the fact that i did\
  \ not do what i suggest to you, on my way to Auschwitz (by bus ) the tour aggency\
  \ played a film telling about the holocaust. Some documentary film, book, or a picture\
  \ even told about the holocaust but I could not even get the feeling until I came\
  \ and walked right in the place where so many victims passed on.\n\nIn 1940, Leader\
  \ of Nazi requested a construction camp in Auschwitz when they set upon Poland.\
  \ A historical place that saves history about Jewish and Nazi Germany. It was used\
  \ as Nazi concentration camp and accepted by UNESCO as world heritage. The extermination\
  \ of Jewish arose here as Auschwitz became the final destination for deportation\
  \ from almost the whole Europe. In there you will definitely feel horrible, emotions,\
  \ sadness, all mix in your heart during the visit. A concentration camp was established\
  \ in Poland consisted of Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Jewish from almost\
  \ every part of EU were brought here by train in weeks or months to be slave labor\
  \ or extermined.\n\nIf you arrived in the first Auschwitz, right in the main gate\
  \ written \u201CArbeit macht frei\u201C, which means \u201Cwork will set you free\u201D\
  . The prisoners were used to queue in front of this gate before began to work every\
  \ morning no matter in what season it was. This concentrated camp was a death camp\
  \ and place to work for the slave-labor. In the beginning of 1942, the systematic\
  \ murdered of Jewish in gas chamber was started in Auschwitz. Young Jewish people\
  \ were used as a slave labor, while disable, mothers, and children were sent to\
  \ the gas chamber and a half-though used as a guinea pig for medical experiment.\n\
  \nAuschwitz I was the main concentration camp and mostly used for the Jewish homestay\
  \ and extermination. There are some blocks that turned to exhibit like: extermination\
  \ \u201Cgas chamber\u201D, sorting, and arrival places. Not only that, the most\
  \ terrible\n\none is you can even see a stack of hairs that placed in a quite big\
  \ room, a room full of shoes, and other personal goods belongs to the victims. It\
  \ was so creepy to be imagined. Remember you are not allowed to take a picture of\
  \ some spots.\n\nAfter finished the tour in the first Auschwitz, we headed to the\
  \ second Auschwitz located in Birkenau. It was around 3 km from the first Auschwitz.\
  \ This place is bigger and colder than Auschwitz 1 and used as the main extermination\
  \ for the prisoners. There you can see the train rail which used as the path to\
  \ bring jews from other countries. The atmosphere of fearful was also there.\n\n\
  By the end of 1945, approximately one million European Jews, up tp 75 000 Polish\
  \ political prisoners, about 21 000 Santi and Roma, 15 000 Soviet prisoners of war\
  \ and at least 10 000 prisoners of other nationalities had been died in Auschwitz.\n\
  \nNow, Poland Government has shifted Auschwitz function becoming museum to respect\
  \ Jews who were exterminated by Nazi and let this place be the memorial of humanity."
