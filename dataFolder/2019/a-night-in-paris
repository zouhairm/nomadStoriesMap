Text: "\u2018I\u2019m sorry, there are no tickets left,\u2019 said the attendant in\
  \ near perfect English. \n\nParis, Gare De Lyon, mid-winter. We were due to leave\
  \ the city of lights for Italy, hunkering down on an overnight train. Or that was\
  \ the plan, but member of our travelling troupe (who shall remain nameless) had\
  \ thoroughly fluffed up the responsibility of buying the tickets and now there were\
  \ none. Not until tomorrow morning could we be on our way. So, we had 12 hours to\
  \ kill, without letting the cold weather kill us. \n\nGetting a hotel seemed like\
  \ the obvious solution. But every hotel we found was fully booked. Two huge boating\
  \ conventions, both that weekend, had ensured that every single bed in the city\
  \ already had a person claiming it. I assume they were all tucked up and dreaming\
  \ of the high seas while we conducted our fruitless search. To add insult to injury\
  \ (frostbite most likely), none of the hotel staff would let us wile away time in\
  \ their lobbies. \n\nA long luxurious dinner at an anonymous little bistro killed\
  \ several hours and improved the mood considerably. The best French onion soup of\
  \ my life certainly helped warm my bones; crunchy, salty cheese bread atop a rich\
  \ broth that tasted sweeter than I\u2019d even imagined onions could be. The room\
  \ was only dimly lit, and to sit over a steaming bowl of food listening to the hum\
  \ of French conversation felt like the truest cultural immersion possible. \n\n\
  As the bistro started to pack down for the night, we tossed a few bitter espressos\
  \ down our throats for fortification and then we were out onto the street again,\
  \ just shy of midnight. Shouldering our packs and wondering where to, we hit the\
  \ road. \n\nThe city was shrouded in the blanket of silence that seems to fall with\
  \ snow. With our heavy gear and the artic weather, we might have been seasoned trekkers\
  \ out on a mountain trail. We made our way along the banks of the Seine, passing\
  \ naked trees and ornate buildings by the dozen. It seemed that we were the only\
  \ tourists in Paris that night, and we had her all to ourselves; we walked alongside\
  \ the shimmering river for an hour with only the fog of our breath for company.\
  \ \n\nThen we heard it, just a vibration at first, but as we got closer the sound\
  \ of swing music floated through the air. Up ahead was a bar, full of blazing lights\
  \ and dancing people. We hurried to the door, hefted off our packs with fervent\
  \ relief and set about warming ourselves from the inside with cheap liquor. By some\
  \ beautiful coincidence, this bar closed at the exact time that the train station\
  \ reopened. The threat of spending our remaining four hours at the mercy of the\
  \ weather melted away in a haze of vodka and a throng of sweaty dancers. Again and\
  \ again, I danced with French boys, my best friends and other travellers, whirling\
  \ around so fast that their faces blurred. As the night faded into morning, we hailed\
  \ a taxi and then finally the time had come for us to board the train. \n\nWe curled\
  \ up in our seats in that way so typical of weary travellers, using jackets for\
  \ pillows and day packs for leg rests, ensconcing ourselves in a cocoon of our possessions.\
  \ I closed my eyes and immediately drifted off, only to wake a few hours later with\
  \ a dead arm and a crick in my neck from sleeping so awkwardly. Outside the window\
  \ though, the scenery rushing past was a blur of landscapes just begging to be committed\
  \ to canvas; immense mountains rising up on one side, and a smooth expanse of fresh\
  \ snow as far as I could see on the other. I leaned back and sighed, thinking that\
  \ the essence of travelling (on a limited budget at least) could be summed up right\
  \ here; you\u2019ve slept for too many hours in a cramped seat and twinged your\
  \ neck as a result, but those hours in that seat have also sat you in front of a\
  \ constant parade of beauty and wonder and all things different from home."
