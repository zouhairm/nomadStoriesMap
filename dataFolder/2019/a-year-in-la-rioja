Text: "Ding. The round tone of a Gmail notification spread through the humid living\
  \ room of my apartment in Minneapolis, the first place I\u2019d rented the summer\
  \ after graduating from university. But instead of the typical blas\xE9 swipe and\
  \ press of deleting yet another sales advertisement, I paused. This was the email\
  \ I\u2019d waited for\u2014the one I tried to forget so I could sleep. I\u2019m\
  \ a poet, so I know about rejection emails. I usually pay them less attention than\
  \ the ads, but this was an acceptance\u2014not of a poem to a journal, but of me\
  \ to a program to teach English in Spain.\n\tBefore graduation, I decided I wanted\
  \ to leave the United States. For how long, I had no idea. I just knew I needed\
  \ to leave, to live elsewhere. Since I already spoke Spanish at a proficient level,\
  \ my thoughts immediately jumped to Spanish-speaking countries. In fact, the fascination\
  \ with Europe I caught during a two-week trip to London and Paris as a twelve-year-old\
  \ led my thoughts to the original Spanish-speaking country: Spain. While figuring\
  \ out how to get there and stay there (bureaucracies and visa\u2019s do exist after\
  \ all), I found the Fulbright program and applied. Unfortunately, I was not accepted.\
  \ Still, I\u2019d enrolled in two university-level Spanish courses to brush up and\
  \ show the Fulbright committee I was keeping up with the language, and my professor\
  \ told me about the Spanish government\u2019s language assistant program. Still\
  \ dreaming of tapas and wine, I applied.\n\tAs on the Fulbright application, I selected\
  \ Madrid as my preferred region. Here, however, there were sections for choosing\
  \ second- and third-choice regions. Because they were in columns from which applicants\
  \ could only pick one, I was left with a handful of regions I knew nothing about\
  \ after choosing Catalunya second. Following a cursory Google search, meanwhile\
  \ thinking only of a fantasy life in Madrid, I decided Wikipedia\u2019s claim that\
  \ La Rioja was the wine region of Spain was enough for me, someone who\u2019s seen\
  \ every wine documentary on Netflix and annoys his friends with tasting notes on\
  \ even the cheapest box variety. I submitted my application and forgot La Rioja\
  \ like I would a housefly exiting through a window.\n\tMost houseflies come right\
  \ back to buzz in your ear though. And there it was. Well, a ding, not a buzz. The\
  \ email assigning me to La Rioja. Panic. Didn\u2019t I read that La Rioja had just\
  \ over 300,000 people? Isn\u2019t their largest city less than half the size of\
  \ Minneapolis? After imagining life in Spain\u2019s largest city, I was ill equipped\
  \ to imagine life in wine country. The first question I consciously asked myself\
  \ was whether I should take the placement. I\u2019d moved from a town of 2,000 to\
  \ a metropolitan area of over 3,000,000, and I\u2019d always imagined continuing\
  \ to move to bigger cities. The only thing I could see then\u2014hot, sticky, and\
  \ surrounded by second-hand furniture draped in crocheted blankets\u2014was the\
  \ population size. Yet, I knew I\u2019d already committed to leaving in my head.\
  \ I\u2019d thought night and day of nothing else since the moment I\u2019d learned\
  \ about the Fulbright program, and I wasn\u2019t going to give that up. I was still\
  \ going to Spain. I confirmed my acceptance.\n\tSure, I\u2019d already made a major\
  \ move once before; I\u2019d never imagined my life without leaps into the unknown.\
  \ That being said, I\u2019d never gone from big to small and had never needed a\
  \ push to take a leap\u2014this time into an unknown barely considered. Some unknowns\
  \ are better. I\u2019ve only ever felt welcome in La Rioja, and I must say the wine\
  \ is, as promised, top notch. I can no longer imagine a life where I haven\u2019\
  t seen the view of every hill and valley decorated in rolling gold as the Tempranillo\
  \ vines celebrate the fall harvest. I look forward to the sunrise painting the mountains\
  \ deep pink every morning on my car ride to work. Most of all, I relish every moment\
  \ I spend with Riojanos, coming closer to being where they are: so in awe of La\
  \ Rioja\u2019s beauty that the thought of leaving is laughable."
