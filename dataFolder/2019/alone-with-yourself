Text: "I\u2019m an introvert person who has a family of extrovert people so imagine\
  \ the reality, that I will have to travel from across the sea and miles away from\
  \ my country to actually work and live in UAE as my contract permits me too. I am\
  \ a nurse and in the philippines, due to low income, people like me dreamed of higher\
  \ salary and hope to work outside the Philippines. I for one is not that kind of\
  \ a person initially, it was the reality of financial problems and family problems\
  \ that lead me to work here and do it what it needs to be done for my family. So\
  \ initially, it was just for an obligation but I\u2019m telling you now, this moving\
  \ has never been easy. \n\nSo fastrack to the time, when I was working here as a\
  \ private nurse and then moving on to being a license HAAD Nurse in UAE. For a person\
  \ likes me whose introvert nature read so much books, and maps. I carefully plan\
  \ a tour on my own, a promise or a goal to visit all the 7 emirates of UAE, which\
  \ comprises of Dubai, Abu dhabi, Sharjah, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Umm al qwain\
  \ and ajman.Did I do it? Did I visit all the 7 emirates? \n\nThe answer is Yes,\
  \ of course but it did take for me 3 years to have done that because there so much\
  \ going on in my life in those 3 years that each visit to this 7 emirates , Its\
  \ meaningful for me and to dive into there culture and exquisite environment. And\
  \ now let me break down to you; the 7 emirates of Uae:\n1.Dubai, its the emirate\
  \ in which the modern and classic uae mixed together to present a perfect art which\
  \ the middle east are so proud of. Its vibrant light and buildings can lit up the\
  \ sky and what its promise; Unity and harmony. From malls to museums, to Burj khalifa\
  \ and Burj Al Arab, its showcase the thriving nation. \n2. Abu Dhabi, the capital\
  \ of Uae, this emirates comprises of the stability of the Uae government, its where\
  \ workforce were more abundant. But don\u2019t be fooled at it, it might be the\
  \ center of economy but there are hidden cities where it offers the best adventure,\
  \ the city of Al Ain, which an oasis to the growing abu dhabi and to the desert\
  \ of uae. it has so many trees that promise fresh air to its people. \n3. Sharjah,\
  \ it more like dubai but it promises wide range of people and culture that is so\
  \ prominent on the old ages of Uae, the dhow yard. \n4. Fujairah, is a place where\
  \ u can experience the sea and the mystery of nature in which in middle east, we\
  \ are to think that it comprises mostly of desert but here, the waves sweep back\
  \ and forth. \n5. Ras Al Khaimah, the emirates of adventure, if fujairah is where\
  \ the sea meets the dessert, Rak is a place where mountains and its highest peak\
  \ resides; the jebel jais; I\u2019ve hike the mountain and it was my first time\
  \ doing that, which is amazing. The jarred mountains keeps you going to the very\
  \ end and in awe to the horizon.\n6. Umm al qwain, this is by far my favorite emirates\
  \ because of the sea, the calmness and the sea breeze that it offers, makes me want\
  \ to stay there. The sun that makes you basked on its light. The kayaking between\
  \ the mangroves. its the simplicity of the sea that makes you wonder how Uae has\
  \ so much to offer.\n7. Ajman, the smallest emirates but the richest for its authenticity\
  \ of cultures of United arab emirates. \n\nUnited Arab Emirates, makes me believe\
  \ that everything is possible, my first step was here in this country and I couldnt\
  \ even believe the path that Ive gone. There so much wonder and awe in this country\
  \ and exploring the 7 emirates doesnt stop there, My goal might be finished but\
  \ I\u2019m likely to have another to explore more of this hidden places in which\
  \ Arab people has to offer. I am thankful and overly blessed."
