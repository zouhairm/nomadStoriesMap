Text: "When I Lost My Husband in the Prado\n\n\n\nI agreed I would meet him in two\
  \ hours, right by the benches close to one of the museum\u2019s entrances.  This\
  \ spot was also close to the museum\u2019s gorgeous gift shops, all four of them.\
  \  This was to be a vital rest for me, because I\u2019d already spent two and a\
  \ half hours touring around this huge, magnificent Spanish museum,  the former palace\
  \ of Spanish kings.  I had earned my stripes, but my legs felt like they were cast\
  \ in concrete from the walking.  \n\nI was exhausted.  I certainly didn\u2019t have\
  \ the museum-going stamina of my mate.  He is an artist\u2014he could extend his\
  \ museum trips to six or seven hours if he wanted to.  Once, he\u2019d told me,\
  \ he had stayed in the Louvre, fascinated  with \u201CWinged Victory\u201D and the\
  \ painting, \u201CThe Wreck of the Medusa\u201D, for eight hours, solo.  When did\
  \ he stop for meals, I\u2019d asked him.  He didn\u2019t, he\u2019d replied.  My\
  \ stomach always dictates my plans !\n\nSo, now I was on my own, and I\u2019d visited\
  \ the Prado gift shop for the second time.  And the third time.  I\u2019d bought\
  \ useful chatchkas such as refrigerator magnets, pencils, postcards, and  T-shirt,\
  \ all with the doll-like face and staring eyes of Velazquez\u2019 superstar painting,\
  \ \u201CLas Meninas\u201D.  That little girl\u2019s gaze really reminded me of Stanley\
  \ Kubrick\u2019s little girls in his movie, \u201CThe Shining\u201D.  It stared\
  \ and stared, in its inscrutable way \u201Cforever and forever\u201D.\n\nI had seen\
  \ all that I could see, in the Prado.  My art-monitor was pushed  way past    100.\
  \  So, at the appointed time, I sat and waited for my husband.  And waited.  And\
  \ waited.  After forty-five minutes and no sign of my husband, Leon, I walked over\
  \ to the Prado Information Desk and inquired if they would make an overhead announcement\
  \ for my missing husband.  They would not.  Actually, they barely understood English,\
  \ and didn\u2019t seem to regard customer service as a high priority, either.  Basically,\
  \ they intoned, I was on my own !  To be fair, my Spanish was just as limited as\
  \ their English.\n\nVisitors shuffled off to the touring George de la Tour exhibit,\
  \ right behind the Information Desk.  There was nothing left to do but tour part\
  \ of the museum again.  Although I\u2019d enjoyed my Spanish jambon sandwich at\
  \ the Cafe, Spanish culture had begun to sour on me.\n\nI walked back, past the\
  \ appointed rendezvous bench and plunged into the bowels of the galleries again.\
  \  There were 20 or 30 galleries to explore.  I walked through rooms of marble nudes,\
  \ exquisite Goya\u2019s, El Greco\u2019s and other treasures that any other museum\
  \ would cry to own.  I also trekked past many uniformed but useless Prado guards.\
  \  They were handsomely dressed, but my appreciation of the museum staff, sadly,\
  \ was at an ebb.\n\nAfter not finding Leon, I returned to the bench, and, just before\
  \ the museum\u2019s closing time, Leon appeared: art-drunk, but otherwise steady\
  \ on his feet.  I was a little angry, but mostly grateful.  I was glad not to have\
  \ lost him to a Spanish dungeon, or a Madrid policeman.  Visions of heading off\
  \ to the airport in a cab, quite solo, or catching the flight back to D.C. without\
  \ a companion had flitted through my mind.  After all, who wants to go through Dulles\u2019\
  \ customs on one\u2019s own ?\n\nI thought of all this and declared, \u201CI\u2019\
  m really glad to see you\u201D.\n\nHe replied, \u201C  Me too.  I lost track of\
  \ the time.\u201D"
