Text: "Tubing! A new word has been incorporated into my language. Vang Vieng and his\
  \ Tubing were one of the funniest days i had the pleasure of living. Well What is\
  \ Tubing? Vang Vieng is a city in Laos prepared exclusively for tourists who make\
  \ the Southeast Asian route, a backpacker paradise in the middle of the jungle.\
  \ An oasis of happiness for travelers on a budget. It has a river with big mountains\
  \ and a huge forest and. It\xB4s scenario seems like Francis Ford Coppola\xB4s Apocalipsis\
  \ Now!, but without the sound of war. The Nam Song river revolves around the city\
  \ and serves as a stage for tourists who are thirsty for alcohol and enjoyment.\
  \ The idea of tubing is around throwing yourself with the help of a rubber tube\
  \ on your hands in a river infected with vermin, wild animals and drunkards from\
  \ different nationalities. The concept is to enter this party is really simple,\
  \ you have to rent a truck camera, throw yourself into the river and after try (try\
  \ harder) to go to the dozens of bars that wait for you at the edge of the river.\
  \ And there one finds people willing to lost his ind with an incredible mountain\
  \ in the background. Mud, sports, music and very cheap drinks are the background\
  \ of this great big festival called Tubing. The next day you will be waiting the\
  \ final judgment with an epic hangover, but worth the pain. A special place for\
  \ exotic party seekers who are looking for an anecdote to remember and new story\
  \ to tell your friends back home. After you recover from the hangover you can still\
  \ have new adventures with laotians: A four hours trip to Vientiane, the capital\
  \ of Laos. A trip which seems to escape from a Bu\xF1uel movie, 4 hours of heat\
  \ and laotians sleeping in the corridor of the bus but that is another backpacker\
  \ story..."
