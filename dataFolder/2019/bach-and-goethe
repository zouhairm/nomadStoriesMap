Text: "It's 5 pm and I'm at a train station in Berlin, capital of the country I went\
  \ exploring for the first time. Honestly, up to this moment I knew nothing about\
  \ the city I'm heading to. Well, not exactly nothing. I knew two things, Johann\
  \ Sebastian Bach died there and Goethe spent his student days there. After 2h train\
  \ ride I arrived at Leipzig Hauptbahnhof. Little did I know that it is the world's\
  \ largest railway station measured by floor area. It has 19 overground platforms\
  \ placed in six iron train sheds and a multi-level entrance with towering stone\
  \ arches. Magnificent. I took my backpack and I headed out. I was lucky that my\
  \ train stopped on a platform at the ground level so I didn't have problems finding\
  \ the exit, because I've learnt all this things few hours later on a hostel bed.\
  \ After a warm welcome and a beautiful smile form the girl at the reception of the\
  \ hostel I've chosen, I've met my roommates. American, who tried speaking German\
  \ with me, but when I told him I prefer English he was relieved; Japanese, who spent\
  \ most of his time behind his laptop and African, who I've met later that night\
  \ when he stumbled in the room around 3 am. A pianist, a photographer, a party person\
  \ and me, student on exchange from small European country exploring Leipzig. All\
  \ four continents between four walls of one small hostel at the center of a city\
  \ we all came to explore. Each one of us for different reasons. Yes, Leipzig has\
  \ so much to offer. I've spent few hours talking with my new friends, finding out\
  \ things about my home for next few days. Leipzig's University, St Thomas Church,\
  \ St Nicholas Church, Leipzig's fine art museum der Bildenden K\xFCnste, historically\
  \ important monument V\xF6lkerschlachtdenkmal, Zeitgeschichtliches Forum, Bach's\
  \ museum, main (market) square Markt, Altes Rathaus, Leipzig zoo, Leipzig Panometer,\
  \ Grassi museum, Leipzig Hauptbahnhof itself, M\xE4dlerpassage, Mendelssohn-Haus\
  \ and many other places are just a little part of this magical city. After that\
  \ talk with them, I went out and my lap into the (un)known started. Walking the\
  \ same streets like these great artists Bach and Goethe, seeing things they saw,\
  \ enjoying in their city.. It was priceless. Discovering all those places that had\
  \ an impact to their work, beautiful nature and fountains all around the city, seeing\
  \ the architecture that leaves you speechless, meeting friendly locals, discovering\
  \ myself in all of that.. That is for sure something I didn't expect to find. Especially\
  \ not in a city I randomly chose a week before."
