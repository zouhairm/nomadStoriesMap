Text: "It feels like walking through the streets of a poor European town. However,\
  \ I am not in Europe. I do not know much about architectural styles, but if I did,\
  \ it would be evident that it is Art Deco, giving away the French influence. The\
  \ houses are narrow and tall, misleadingly called \u201Ctube houses\u201D, sometimes\
  \ so strikingly different from one another, bringing variety to a place where it\
  \ is abundant. There are even cathedrals with massive symmetrical towers made of\
  \ white concrete, darkened by the passing of the time. Even though the architecture\
  \ is distinctly French, the way of life is not. There are eateries everywhere, open\
  \ and welcoming, with comically tiny chairs surrounding small decorative tables,\
  \ as if the whole city is a miniature model made by a kid for his social studies\
  \ project. Although the streets are narrow, one could not easily get from one canteen\
  \ to the opposite. Every crossing is an obstacle course between the hundreds of\
  \ motorcycles, whirring through the few cars that have so improvidently blocked\
  \ the Old Quarter. This is definitely not Europe. It is the capital of Vietnam-\
  \ Hanoi. \n\t The little gem in the center of Hanoi is the legendary lake Hoan Kiem.\
  \ As the legend goes, a long time ago a Vietnamese emperor returned a fabled sword\
  \ to the Turtle God that dwells in the lake. \u201CThe Lake of the Returned Sword\u201D\
  . There is a small islet in the middle with an ancient tower, aptly named Turtle\
  \ Tower- compact and sturdy just like the animal. A pedestrian path goes around\
  \ the lake. The Temple of the Jade Mountain is on an island on the other side of\
  \ the lake, connected by a red metal bridge. With all the natural and manmade beauty\
  \ the lake presents it is a pity that the water is polluted and the fish are belly-up,\
  \ washed on the shore. I sit on one of the benches near the lake and think about\
  \ the dysfunctional relationship between modernity and nature, between the future\
  \ and the present. \n\tThe people that come and go are all so different. Old and\
  \ young, locals and foreigners, Ph\u1EDF-slurpers and B\xE1nh m\xEC sandwich-munchers.\
  \ \n\t\u201CHello mister, may I sit next to you?\u201D a cheery boy is standing\
  \ in front of me. At first, I think it is yet another vendor trying to sell me his\
  \ trinkets, but my suavity responds affirmatively almost immediately. \n\t\u201C\
  My name is Hoa. May I practice my English with you, sir?\u201D \nThat is something\
  \ new. As an English teacher, I am used to youngsters declining my requests to practice\
  \ their English with me. His politeness is outstanding and I agree. A smile appears\
  \ on my face. \n\tEven though Hoa is 12 we talk about many different subjects. He\
  \ asks me if I like Vietnam, if I have tried Ph\u1EDF, if I have been to the Palace.\
  \ We talk about geography, the ongoing World Cup, even politics. His English is\
  \ outstanding. He claims he has learned English watching videos and talking to strangers\
  \ near the Lake. \n\t\u201CWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201D I ask.\
  \ It is a common question to ask a 12-year-old, is it not?\n\t\u201CA programmer.\
  \ That is the future. In the future, many jobs will change with robots. Like cleaners\
  \ (he points to a nearby cleaner), sellers (points again) and taxi drivers (and\
  \ again). Some jobs will not change- doctor, lawyer, politician...\u201D \nPho is\
  \ as ready for the future as he is observant. \n\t\u201CI believe doctors will change\
  \ though- they make mistakes and get tired, unlike robots.\u201D \n\tHoa smiles.\
  \ It is as if he anticipated my retort. \n\t\u201CPeople want to be treated, but\
  \ also want compassion and love. A robot cannot give you that.\u201D \n\tThis strikes\
  \ me. A thought so deep and profound, yet elegant and obvious. \nA world of opposites,\
  \ I reason. Past and modern. French and Vietnamese. Emperors and gods. Water and\
  \ earth. Nature and buildings. Life and death. Soup and sandwiches. Locals and foreigners.\
  \ Present and future. Robots and love. \n\tYet, Hoa knows. \n\tHis father comes\
  \ to pick him up. We part ways- he gets his daily English lesson and I get the lesson\
  \ of a lifetime."
