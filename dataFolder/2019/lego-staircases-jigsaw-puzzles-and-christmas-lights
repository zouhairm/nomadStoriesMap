Text: "Landing at Bolivia\u2019s El Alto Airport can be dizzying. At an altitude of\
  \ 4100m, the oxygen is thin and breathing can be difficult. Yet, upon touching down,\
  \ my eyes widened and my heart pounded. The incredibly expansive views from the\
  \ air quickly introduced the distinct geography of Bolivia's two adjacent Cities,\
  \ El Alto and La Paz. As La Paz was my travel destination, I continued to spectacle\
  \ at its sights during a 20 minute, downhill, taxi ride to my city central accommodation.\
  \ Consequently to arriving at the centre of South America's\u2019 horn tooting,\
  \ minibus congested city, the view was less spectacular and the energy more chaotic.\
  \ But I was ready, having thoroughly researched the many safety warnings for travellers\
  \ to this city. Pickpockets were not slipping into my handbag and taxi drivers were\
  \ going to give me the correct change. Admittedly, my two day exploration of La\
  \ Paz suddenly felt less daunting and more delighting. \n\nLa Paz is built in a\
  \ canyon, creating a Bowl-like effect. However, what is most enchanting are the\
  \ hundreds of thousands of Orange Brick Houses cascading the canyons 360\xB0 interior\
  \ from skyline to city centre. If you look up from the bottom they look like Lego\
  \ Brick Staircases. Simultaneously the houses appear both uniform like and muddled.\
  \ This confusion occurs because houses are built upon and between other houses in\
  \ an effort to squeeze another in. However, the orange brick is a consistently used\
  \ material. \n\nAnd if you are captivated by the Lego Staircases, you will certainly\
  \ be in awe of how the people of La Paz earn a living in this developing country.\
  \ To get by, the people sell anything from freshly squeezed orange juice to handcrafted\
  \ hair scrunchies. Everyday the traditionally dressed woman, called Cholitas, and\
  \ other local people carry their goods and dismantled stalls on their backs. Then\
  \ they set up to sell their goods on every footpath space in sight. Walking through\
  \ these stalls is like being in a 1000 Piece Jigsaw Puzzle. Everything is cheek\
  \ to cheek and if there is a space to move, it is like a piece is missing. Weaving\
  \ through these stalls, I was surprised not to be haggled. The working women chatted\
  \ to their fellow stall mates and sold goods whilst eating their lunch. I would\
  \ almost have to say \u201Cexcuse me\u201D if I wanted to make a purchase. Perhaps\
  \ in a place of need and little excess, customer service is not needed. The local\
  \ people buy what they need and there is no point in up selling. Or perhaps it is\
  \ the gentle and quiet nature of the Bolivian people going about their business\
  \ without bothering yours. Either way, I expect they earn a living and not much\
  \ more. Yet, they seem to go about their lives in a calm and worry free manner.\
  \ \n\nWhat you should be worried about in La Paz is the lack of compliance to traffic\
  \ light cues. In my mind, they serve a better purpose as Christmas Lights. And as\
  \ the footpaths are flooded with stalls, the road doubles as a pedestrian crossing\
  \ and an alternative walkway. As a pedestrian, I adjusted quickly to the discombobulated\
  \ traffic laws. If a minibus stopped in the middle of the road to pick up a passenger,\
  \ it was my opportunity to navigate my way through the abundance of smog farting\
  \ vehicles to get to my desired destination. Cheap Thrills I say.\n\nAdmittedly,\
  \ I was a little daunted about coming to La Paz heeding all the safety warnings.\
  \ However, I felt nothing but amazed by this city. From the astonishing architecture\
  \ of the Lego Staircases to the Jigsaw Puzzle of the markets, to the decorative\
  \ Christmas Lights of the streets; Bolivians carried on without fuss. I would suggest,\
  \ if you are into Jaywalking or running red lights whilst looking at a magnificent\
  \ view, this is the place for you. Watch out though, La Paz could leave you breathless.\n\
