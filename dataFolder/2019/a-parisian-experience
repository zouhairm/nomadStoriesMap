Text: "I spent my summer of the year 2015 in Paris. Well, the city always has a charm.\
  \ It looks pretty anytime and every time you wander through it.\n\nI still remember\
  \ the time when I was about to land in Paris. A Taylor Swift song playing on my\
  \ iPod and the aeroplane landing at the Charles De Gaulle international terminal.\
  \ It was so magical, I also did cry that time. Well, Paris has that effect on a\
  \ girl.\n\nThe next day we were off to our adventure around the city of Paris. We\
  \ took the hop on - hop off bus around the city and saw some of the most popular\
  \ places known. The Champs-\xC9lys\xE9es, Arc de Triomphe, The Louvre, Notre-Dame\
  \ de Paris, Eiffel Tower, Montmartre, etc.\n\nClimbing the steps of Montmartre was\
  \ very tiring, but it was completely worth it. Various artist lined on the steps\
  \ and the streets. Painting on the blank canvas and filling it with their feelings.\n\
  \nThe view was spectacular. Looking at the entire city from this one point was so\
  \ enchanting. It was one of the best experiences. When strolling on the Champs-\xC9\
  lys\xE9es I turned into Holly stopping by every shop and staring inside.\n \n  \
  \   Frankly speaking, Paris was the first time I tried a lot of different sweet\
  \ items. Macarons, Crepes, Eclairs, Scones ..... The list keeps going on. The French\
  \ have so many types of bread and baked goods, which are so delectable...\n\nThe\
  \ evening by the gardens near Eiffel Tower was one of the best evenings. With French\
  \ music playing and people dancing. Even my sister and I tried to tap our feet until\
  \ we both fell down cause we don't do The Tango (Not sure but it was Tango). We\
  \ had a good time tapping and breaking our feet \U0001F602 \U0001F602 but who cares.\n\
  \nMy Parisian experience was short but one of the best memories.....\" VIVA LA FRANCE\
  \ \" et Arrivera bient\xF4t"
