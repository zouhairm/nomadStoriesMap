Text: "We would have been forgiven for thinking we might have to eventually paddle\
  \ to our destination, such were the incessant gasps of our dying engine. Still,\
  \ even inside our sick and rickety vessel, our survival instincts came secondary\
  \ as profound wonderment took over. After all, we were in the Amazon searching for\
  \ a hut whose location remained a mystery.\n \nAs loud as our boat may have been\
  \ as it clung onto life, louder still were the collective whispers and screams of\
  \ nature. Branches whipping, indigenous Capybara\u2019s grunting, parrots the colours\
  \ of the rainbow chanting their welcome. This was no longer man's doorstep, this\
  \ was nature's domain and we were just here to visit. Or else. \n\nSlowly we navigated\
  \ the endless twists of the murky waterways, each indistinguishable from the last.\
  \ If there are fifty shades of grey, the rain forest presented a thousand shades\
  \ of green, only with less sexual tension. Our guide tells us of the possibility\
  \ of seeing a Jaguar. It is clear his words have a mystical power because it is\
  \ at that moment that we all swear to see one hiding in the shadows of the winding\
  \ embankment. (i) Just here to visit, or else.\n\nSeizing the moment of tension,\
  \ a local plunges his arms into the water and wrestles out a baby Cayman. It is\
  \ quickly returned, though our nervous energy is enough to fuel Rio De Janeiro itself.\
  \ We find our hut. The group sleeps surprising well even as a militia of mosquito\
  \ try their best to penetrate our netting. We win this battle though they would\
  \ later win the war. \n \nWe awake to the smell of imminent rain. Today\u2019s goal\
  \ is to find an oxbow lake nestled somewhere within the vastness of the jungle.\
  \ While dark sediment infiltrates the Amazon river an oxbow lake has long been cut\
  \ off from the source. The results are near crystal-clear waters. To discover this\
  \ ourselves we must traverse a large expanse of jungle whose sheer size and height\
  \ mesmerize and dumbfound. Kapok trees peak their heads above their neighbours as\
  \ we walk on in awe of nature's Manhattan. The tree's feel directly out of a Tolkien\
  \ novel and I am sure if they could speak (or I understand), they would speak in\
  \ the wisest of tones. I nominate David Attenborough to translate. As we reach our\
  \ destination we greet the Tarantulas and Spider monkey\u2019s that usher us in.\
  \ I wonder If the two appreciate the irony in their names.\n\nAt the lake, we board\
  \ an even smaller boat, possibly safe for two people. Naturally, six of us are marshalled\
  \ on. You hear of animals sensing fear, but perhaps not always with bad intentions\
  \ because it's at this moment that we are calmed by a strange engulfing of what\
  \ must be a few hundred butterflies. Their colours presenting as if a kaleidoscope\
  \ had gently sneezed across their wings, turning our mounting anxiety into awe.\
  \ So surreal I name the first two Salvador and Dali. \n\nReturning, our guide tries\
  \ his best to get us lost, though eventually we find our way home. As we peel off\
  \ our armour from the day's adventures, we are informed what our last night will\
  \ entail - a night trek deep into the jungle, with nothing but a torch and a blunt\
  \ machete. Our entourage would struggle warding off a newborn puppy let alone the\
  \ mysteries of the Amazon. A point a member of the group is sure to make, albeit\
  \ with slightly more exotic wording.\n \nThe goal it appears is to venture deep\
  \ into the belly of the jungle and separate ourselves from the nearest person. Then,\
  \ collectively, to fall silent and become one with our surroundings. If one could\
  \ bottle the emotion in that moment of serenity, it would be richer than diamond\
  \ oil. It is pitch black and we do well to see our own form.  Monkey's howl above\
  \ us, sloths wave half-heartedly and a series of yet-to-be-discovered species whistle\
  \ and screech. All this amid a cacophony of bird violins. The Amazon\u2019s orchestra\
  \ is utterly intoxicating.\n\nWe make it home. Unbelievably yet to be devoured by\
  \ a Jaguar, though they are now my favourite animal, and the Amazon, my favourite\
  \ jungle."
