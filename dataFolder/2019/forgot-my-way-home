Text: "\u201CDont play too far, i will buy you those toys that you like, you can invite\
  \ your friends to play with you at home\u201D said mum. \n\u201CIf you play too\
  \ far, you cant get lost, it will makes me worry\u201D she added.\n\nThus i never\
  \ really went far, so much even to other cities in my country. \n\nHowever, now\
  \ my toys are vanished, and my friends i dont know where, and nothing really keeping\
  \ me home because no one prohibit me anymore, because even mum already \u201Cgone\u201D\
  \ before me. \n\nI forgot my way home until i went insane and dream what would be\
  \ the difference of riding a camel in marroco or in egypt, i forgot my way home\
  \ until i dream to board the train passing the heavenly Swiss, i forgot my way home\
  \ until i dream that i enjoy eating croissants for breakfast in some porch somewhere\
  \ in Paris, i forgot my way home that dream of venturing in the heart of London\
  \ just like those british people, i forgot my way home that i dream of songing and\
  \ dancing in Mumbai India, i forgot that I actually dont have any tallent except\
  \ that i am not easily gives up. Even thought i hit rock botton plenty of times\
  \ i always tried to get. back up."
