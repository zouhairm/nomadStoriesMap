Text: "All tied up.\n\nIt\u2019s late October when my plane lands at JFK. My university\
  \ in Johannesburg sent me on an academic trip to Connecticut, but agreed to book\
  \ my flight earlier and to a different airport upon my request to spend a week in\
  \ New York first. I love airports. Imagine the web of intersecting stories that\
  \ would continuously be weaved if every human had a never-ending string attached\
  \ to their back? Every string mapping everywhere we walk, drive, fly, sail, or cycle\
  \ to. Now imagine the glorious knots that airports would be. I leave JFK - my string\
  \ trailing. \n\nHowever unethical, I use my \u2018journalism-student-from-Africa\u2019\
  \ identity to probe into the lives of unsuspecting New Yorkers. It\u2019s like having\
  \ a permit to interrogate people without them feeling harassed or like criminals.\n\
  \nMy first target: Michael, a Rockaway Beach native I met on the ferry to his hometown.\
  \ After we dock, he walks across town with me (it\u2019s that small that you walk\
  \ across it, not through it or in it. I can hardly believe I\u2019m in New York).\
  \ He shows me a house that got chopped right in half when a main road was built\
  \ where the sitting room used to be. I learn that he\u2019s a broken-hearted lifeguard,\
  \ house flipper, and surfer (Rockaway Beach has a thriving surfing community, and\
  \ yes, it really is in New York). \u201CThat\u2019s my church,\u201D he says pointing\
  \ to the ocean. My string wraps around his ankle like his surfboard leash would.\n\
  \nMy credit card is rejected when I try to buy a ferry ticket back to Downtown Manhattan.\
  \ I run along the pier with the smell of live bait clinging to the back of my throat,\
  \ looking for an ATM. The last ferry leaves in 10 minutes. An old Mexican man fishing\
  \ off the pier points me in the right direction. Cash in hand, I thank the angler\
  \ as I bolt past him. \u2018No problem miha,\u2019 he says. I want to stop to investigate\
  \ but the ferry won\u2019t wait. My string and his fishing line knots together.\
  \ \n\nThe next day, I\u2019m on my way back from thrift shopping in Bushwick, when\
  \ a man wobbles onto the L-train lugging a washing machine on a make-shift trolley.\
  \ I smile at him and wonder what kind of life demands of him to haul heavy appliances\
  \ around on public transport. And I wonder how in the world he\u2019s going to get\
  \ that thing up the stairs when he gets to where he needs to be. My string is tumbled,\
  \ rinsed, spun, and hung to dry over his weighed down shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s 1am\
  \ now and my phone died on the subway, so I\u2019m navigating my way around NYC\u2019\
  s Financial District, using the \u201Cthis looks familiar\u201D and \u201Cnever\
  \ seen this, turn around\u201D method. Ah, a Citi Bike station map. That\u2019ll\
  \ help. It tells me with a red pin that \u201Cyou are here\u201D, and I drag my\
  \ finger across the lit up plastic box trying to find Pearl street, because I want\
  \ to be there. I memorise the number of lefts and rights and straight-until-I get-to\u2019\
  s. I make it to the apartment one floor down from the one Yoko Ono held her summer\
  \ soirees in (if the middle-aged couple with their sticky toddlers who inhabit it\
  \ now can be believed). My string winds around the crayons on the hardwood floor\
  \ and joins the laces of the shoes lined up at the door to tie in bows. My string\
  \ underlines and encircles the revelation that just like this mom and dad raising\
  \ kids in a rumoured iconic hangout hub, just like this washing machine mover, this\
  \ fisherman, this surfer who can fix houses but not his own broken heart: people\
  \ grow up and old in New York City too. People come back to New York City from vacations\
  \ too. It\u2019s not all dreams and stars and models jogging and writers scribbling\
  \ masterpieces in studio apartments. I wonder if it\u2019s still magical if you\u2019\
  ve puked and fought with someone you love and failed a maths exam in NYC? I\u2019\
  ll have to trace my string back here to investigate someday. In the name of journalism,\
  \ of course."
