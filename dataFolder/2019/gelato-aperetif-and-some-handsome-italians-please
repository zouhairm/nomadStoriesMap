Text: "We were leisurely eating mango ice-cream sitting on the curb. It was a typical\
  \ narrow Italian street with small bars and cafes. The waiters were smiling friendly,\
  \ tourists were taking pictures and dreaming about aperitif. They were so loud and\
  \ funny that I couldn`t stop laughing. Aperitif, undoubtedly, was always a good\
  \ idea. I was thinking about it looking at the sky and eating the most delicious\
  \ gelato.\n\n I moaned. Have you ever felt pleasure and pain at the same time? After\
  \ walking about 18 kilometers yesterday, my poor legs revolted. I supposed to be\
  \ a piece of wood that had never visited yoga classes. Therefore we agreed to do\
  \ yoga that day. \nBeing extremely lucky, we`d already got lost thanks to the google\
  \ maps which in Italy were more disoriented than tourists. However, if they worked\
  \ properly, we`re sitting in front of the studio. \nIntercoms that you may find\
  \ in each house annoyed me since I was unable to understand what button should I\
  \ press. \n\nThanks Goodness, it wasn`t as hot as usually. Mist clouds and light\
  \ wind were a remedy from the summer heat. It was too early to study Italian grammar\
  \ in order to prepare for tomorrow lesson and too late to go to Mercato Centrale\
  \ to buy some figs. I found out that apples were quite expensive (comparing to prices\
  \ in my motherland), but some exotic fruit you could easily find and buy. \n\n\u2014\
  \  Stand up.\nMy sister interrupted my thoughts stream. I got so immersed in dreaming\
  \ about fruit, aperitif and a handsome Italian standing in front of us that was\
  \ ready to cry. \nHowever, the way she looked at me or, perhaps, the fact that the\
  \ weather had changed and the taste of raining soaked the air made me stand up,\
  \ groaning and wailing, and go to the yoga studio.\n\nSometimes I think that God\
  \ likes writing and reading some funny stories where my sister and I, undoubtedly,\
  \ are main characters. Anyway, he has a great sense of humor.\n\n When we finally\
  \ found the entrance, the manager, smiling widely, told us that the studio was closing\
  \ right now. \nI wasn`t as sad as I pretended to be. I felt so tired after our weekend\
  \ journeys that wanted to sleep. And Italian boyfriend. And aperitif with figs and\
  \ papaya (which weren`t as tasty as I`d dreamt).\n\nThe door closed and we turned\
  \ back. It was raining cats and dogs.\n\nTwo young Italians were standing in front\
  \ of the exit and discussing something I couldn`t hear. One of them was rather young.\
  \ He was dressed as an office worker, rather stylish and catchy. He smelt so freaking\
  \ well and his voice was so delightful that I felt my knees trembling. The other\
  \ one was a bit older. His deep set eyes were surrounded by small wrinkles. He was\
  \ smiling so kindly and speaking so calmly that I decided to ask him.\n\n\u2014\
  \ Scusi\u2026 Don`t you know how long it will be raining? \n\u2014 I suppose it\
  \ will finish soon. However\u2026 it`s quite dangerous to go outside now. \n\u2014\
  \ Why\u2026 \nI didn`t finish since we heard glass smashing. Hail, rain and wind\u2026\
  \ It seemed that the weather, tired from heat, was rebelling.\n\n\u2014 Oh Dio!\
  \ \u2014 I flinched. \u2014 It was a window!\n\nItalians exchanged glances. The\
  \ young man (I still remember his name) offered us to wait in their office upstairs\
  \ since it was dangerous to continue staying there. \n\nToday I am not sure such\
  \ suggestions should be accepted, but they both were looking so friendly and outgoing\
  \ that we readily agreed. \n\nTheir office was rather big with two windows, cozy\
  \ chairs and a huge table in the middle of the room. They offered us some water,\
  \ give my sister a charger and spent with us one incredible hour I would never forget.\
  \  We`re talking about studying, Italian food, music and travelling. \nThose men\
  \ were engineers and were making projects of railway stations and high-speed trains.\
  \ One of them visited our native city and worked there for two months. \nSometimes\
  \ I think about him. If we had met earlier, would our story have been so curious?\
  \ \n\nWell... God certainly has a sense of humor."
