Text: "So 3years back, I was doing an English Language course from international Islamic\
  \ University Islamabad, when i get notified that some adventure club is arranging\
  \ a trip to Mirnanjani and literally, I never had been with any trip before in my\
  \ life but as I was very depressed mentally upset because of my 2 year gap after\
  \ fsc due to certain issues, i decided to went on this trip even though I had no\
  \ friends there and also without even asking my parents I submitted the registration\
  \ fee and got myself registered because I knew they would not stop me from going.\
  \ \nAs it was my first experience of hiking so i took a big bag full of water bottles,\
  \ an umbrella, lots of junk food with me which literally was quite hard to carry\
  \ but still i somehow manage to took it with me. so one of the beautiful parts of\
  \ that trip was the fun we did on your way to mushkpuri, there were students from\
  \ different universities in that coaster and there were around 20 such coasters\
  \ with us, so we played many games on the coaster, we sang songs, danced our heart\
  \ out and even though I didn't know anyone from there but I made many friends and\
  \ we enjoyed a lot, that literally was the best time of my life. After we reached\
  \ there, they gave us refreshments and tied a ribbon around our wrists so it would\
  \ be easy for them to recognize us. then we started trekking through the forests,\
  \ it was really beautiful and mesmerizing, cool breeze blowing through my hair in\
  \ an unknown place with unknown people, away from all the distress and anxiety that\
  \ was the best felling. Mushkpuri is 9200ft high peak, which normally takes 2-3\
  \ hours for people to reach the top and that time there was snow everywhere so it\
  \ was harder for us to walk on that but it was fun, we walked and walked and walked\
  \ till a friend of mine suggested that we should take the horse ride, so we rode\
  \ on that and reached the Mushkpuri Top on that horse which was fun but No doubt\
  \ was too scary. when we reached the Mushkpuri Top we literally couldn't believe\
  \ on our eyes, that was my most beautiful sight, the clouds were on the ground,\
  \ there was snow all around and the view was amazing. people reached before us have\
  \ ignited fire and were making Bar-B-q there, then I went looking for a corner and\
  \ started meditating there which was too peaceful and distressing, I felt like all\
  \ my weight lifted off and my energy got renewed and I found my soul there, it was\
  \ so beautiful I never really wanted to come back from there, I wanted to stay there\
  \ for my entire life and that day for the first time, I meditated for more than\
  \ an hour because I got really lost into some other world which was too peaceful\
  \ that I never really wanted to come into this life again. But in that period I\
  \ got separated from my crew and everyone had left the top so I decided to go alone,\
  \ but while I was hiking I fall off as the track were slippery and the guy coming\
  \ from back picked me up and decided to come off with me so he could help me reach\
  \ back safely to where the coasters were. so during that journey, we shared a lot\
  \ about each other, I shared with him my fears, my dreams, what excites me and what\
  \ I am really passionate about and also what scares me and holds me back, I literally\
  \ told him everything I had been holding back in mind for years and was afraid to\
  \ take it out and that felt really good and the best thing is that it has been 3\
  \ years and he's still a very good friend of mine. So, after we reached at the ground,\
  \ they served us dinner and that we went back for our homes and that was the best\
  \ trip of my life, i can't ever forget how i felt there, it's really just etched\
  \ into my mind."
