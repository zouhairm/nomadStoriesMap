Text: "Everytime I pack my motorcycle for yet a new trip , 'resfeber' overwhelms me.\
  \ Restless to get on the road. The only time I know who I am is when I take a leap\
  \ into the unknown. Truth be told I never know what the next gravel road or little\
  \ town will deliver, the positive impact it will have on me.\nOnes again my motorcycle\
  \ took me on a round trip with a good friend of mine leaving Cape Town and the Western\
  \ Cape Province in the early  hours at 6:30 am  through four of the nine provinces\
  \ and  3572kms  of beautiful South Africa. To experience the unknown in its fullest\
  \ you turn of on a gravel road with just a number. There is where the stories hide.\n\
  \nWe started day one with a long day in the saddle. We crossed our first province\
  \ called the Northen Cape,  in to the heart of the Karoo, the most bluest skies\
  \ can be found there. Wasn't long as we just stood in the middle of nowhere taking\
  \ pictures as one big dust cloud stopped behind us. We were greeted by the most\
  \ friendly courier guy by the name of Loyd, also a fellow biker who couldn't resist\
  \ to meet us and share pictures of his motorcycle with us.  Our first night would\
  \ be on a real karoo working farm. The hospitality overwhelming and the stories\
  \ of the people who know  hard times, but still they see and feel the beauty in\
  \ each day. \n\nWith the next five days spent in the Eastern Free State there after.\
  \ So much different from the Karoo. The smell of cosmos next to the road, blooming\
  \ in full after the rain so desperately needed. Lesotho, a neighbour country kept\
  \ on teasing us with  glimpses of her beautiful mountains. The trip already in the\
  \ making to go tame the mighty Sani Pass by motorcycle. \n\nGolden Gate National\
  \ Park, one word...Mesmerizing! Everything and so much more. The eroded sandstone\
  \ cliffs and outcrops , especially the Brandwag rock covers the whole park. There\
  \ was no better time then to check in to the yearly Clarens Craft Beer Festival.\
  \ Feast indeed. Good reason to go back next year.\n\nAfter the Free State visit,\
  \ and I didn't want to leave my I might ad. To grow up in that part of the country,\
  \ your soul always long to be home for a little while, we started our journey back\
  \ to Cape Town, with no route planned. Taking each day as a mystery ride and see\
  \ what happens. We eventually ended in a town called Aliwal North. It meant we crossed\
  \ yet another province as we rode into the Eastern Cape over the big Hertzog Bridge.\n\
  \nFunny the next day we had a plan, meaning it would be the second longest day on\
  \ the trip with over 600kms to cover. We headed out to Oudtshoorn, 'land of the\
  \ ostrich'. Sorry next time we might just stop and take a ride on the back of one.\
  \ Even though it was one hard ride, the open road, endless surprises makes my wild\
  \ and free spirit happy.\n\nOur second last day provided rain early after breakfast\
  \ as we left the little town of Barrydale. Tradouw Pass  wet and cold, but every\
  \ turn one surprise after the other. We arrived at the De Kelders, a little coastal\
  \ village in the Overberg. The ocean roared a kinda 'Welcome Back'.\nAs we sat on\
  \ the patio overlooking the sunset, reflecting back on a trip, my heart screams\
  \ for more and more.\n\nThe truth- Every morning when you have the privilege to\
  \ have a new day, the unknown of the day lies ahead and you need bravery and courage\
  \ to take the leap and fight for the kind of life you imagined and dreamed of. Finding\
  \ your passion and purpose by having big faith in a small leap into the unknown."
