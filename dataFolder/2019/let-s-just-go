Text: 'It was a very windy day yet it''s very humid. I can feel the hot air through
  my face by the wind. Yet, it''s very calming to stay in this rooftop building.


  I can see the train passing by and the horn from this far. Wondering where are those
  people going? Are they going home? Going to travel or just arrived picking up love
  ones.


  I''m starting to get used to with the hectic situation of traffic here, in Jakarta,
  Indonesia. Wondering if I could just leap to the unknown village or country probably
  will extend my mind seeing the world. I always want to explore the world, just like
  most of the people I love traveling and meeting new people. Also guide them if I
  have some spare time.


  Maybe this is one of the chance that the universe offers me to join. I am a bit
  hesitate to join this kind of ''luck games'' or whatever giveaways some brand like
  to offer. Because I don''t have that kind of luck or previledge like anybody. But,
  this time I don''t know, something in me really push me to join and write this.


  Hopefully I will get the chance to join and explore the exotic scene of Portugal
  this year.'
