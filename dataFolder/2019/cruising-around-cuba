Text: "\u201CHeeeeyyyyyy. From Australia?\u201D shouted the Cuban as I tried to enter\
  \ the Cigar factory. \nI didn\u2019t know what gave it away. Was it the backpack?\
  \ The Australia t-shirt? This local was such a sleuth.\n\u201CI\u2019m Hector. From\
  \ Cuba,\u201D admitted Hector, from Cuba, wearing a grin so large his dimples formed\
  \ outside his face.\n\u201CI\u2019m just going into this cigar factory,\u201D I\
  \ diverted.\n\u201CYou can\u2019t; it\u2019s closed.\u201D Hector gestured oddly\
  \ at the entrance. The attendant rotated the Open sign to Closed, although the factory\
  \ looked strangely busy.\n\u201CIt\u2019s only 1:00pm.\u201D\n\u201CHaha. Yeah they\
  \ close for lunch. You should\u2019ve just asked me! Haha. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019\
  ll get you some of the best cigars in Cuba. Beautiful.\u201D\n\u201CI don\u2019\
  t smoke.\u201D\nHector looked at me strangely. \u201CWhy go to the factory then?\u201D\
  \n\u201CDon\u2019t know. People said I need to \u2018do\u2019 this.\u201D\nA jovial\
  \ eruption of volcanic proportions spewed from Hector\u2019s mouth. \u201CAustralians...\
  \ So funny.\u201D\nThat meeting of Hector was a pivotal Cuban moment. It started\
  \ things. Hector was as friendly and fun as Cuba is long, and our time together\
  \ was comprehensively extended.\nAfter walking away from the cigar factory, Hector\
  \ followed. \n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, Australia. Let\u2019s have lunch.\u201D\n\
  Hector hailed a cab and led me with such a casual confidence that I followed this\
  \ total stranger in this strange land. I had been walking the cobbled streets of\
  \ Cuba for three days, and whilst I wasn\u2019t lonely, the company was appreciated.\n\
  Hector spoke in lightning-fast Spanish to the driver, and dropped what must have\
  \ been only a few cents into his hand. Before I knew at, we were in a funky Cuban\
  \ bar.\nA funky Cuban bar doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there\u2019s a hip crowd\
  \ drinking flowing cocktails. In Castro-Cuba, a funky bar just means the bar is,\
  \ well, open. Hemingway, as Hector would explain, visited this bar to drink. A lot.\
  \ This truly was funky to me, as I had been to Hemingway\u2019s Havana house the\
  \ day before, and even entered his writing room that overlooked the waters heading\
  \ to Florida. \nI would later find out that Hemingway either drank a lot in every\
  \ single bar in Cuba, or it was a line locals would pen when trying to sell their\
  \ country to tourists.\nAfter Hector and I had lunch, two new friends cruised around\
  \ Cuba, visiting whatever we could manage.\nThis frenetic touring of Cuba felt like\
  \ a job, and jobs are difficult to get in Cuba.\n\u201CThe best job in Cuba,\u201D\
  \ Hector confided, \u201Cis to be a pilot.\u201D\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\n\u201CA pilot\
  \ in Cuba often flies to Mexico, and there they sell our Cuban cigars to American\
  \ tourists. They get rich!\u201D Hector exclaimed, laughing knowingly.\nOn our last\
  \ night together, he said: \u201CRemember I said I would get you the best Cuban\
  \ cigars?\u201D Hector took out a majestic mahogany case with 50 Cuban cigars inside.\
  \ They looked beautiful. They felt like contraband.\n\u201CBut I don\u2019t smoke.\u201D\
  \n\u201CYou\u2019re going to Mexico. Sell them. You will be rich.\u201D\nAnd then\
  \ Hector said, as I hadn\u2019t properly read the room, \u201C$50 please.\" I begrudgingly\
  \ handed over the money and he handed over the case, with a card to a shop in Mexico\
  \ where I could sell them.\n\nIn Mexico, I walked directly to the recommended shop.\
  \ My incredible Cuban journey would be punctuated with a financial windfall. I would\
  \ be rich.\nThe scrupulous attendant at the cigar shop laughed when I presented\
  \ Hector\u2019s case.\n\u201CBut Hector said\u2026\u201D\n\u201CLook.\u201D\nHe\
  \ put my case of cigars under an ultra violet light as he said, \u201Cthese are\
  \ cigars\u201D. All I could see was a case of cigars under an ultra violet light.\
  \ Then he grabbed another case from his store and put it under the light, as he\
  \ said, \u201Cthese are Cuban cigars\u201D. The ultra violet light showed the cigars\
  \ covered in verification labels invisible to the naked eye.\n\u201CBut Hector\u2026\
  \u201D\n\u201CGo.\u201D\nFor two weeks Hector followed me around Cuba, detailing\
  \ the history of his people and how hard life was as a Cuban. We danced like Cubans.\
  \ Drank rum like Cubans. Ate rice and beans like Cubans. Gestured oddly at cigar\
  \ factory attendants, like, evidently, Cubans.\nHad he done all this for $50.00?\n\
  He should\u2019ve just asked me."
