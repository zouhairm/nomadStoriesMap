Text: "Aparently it was a trip that could bring back a lot a bad memories of a terrible\
  \ relationship that was ended almost a year before, but instead it became one of\
  \ those places that I could call home. I was finally in Ouro Preto, a historical\
  \ city in Brazil that contains a solid base of the slavery period of our history.\
  \ The old arquitectural, the grandiloquent churches and the gold culture that still\
  \ surround the place. I did this trip in just one day, because I was passing by\
  \ Belo Horizonte and didn\xB4t want to miss again on this oportunity.  Instantly\
  \ I felt captured in that moment it was like I had travel back in time and even\
  \ though it was full of tourists and cameras and the whole idea that it was 2018\
  \ I didn\xB4t seamed like that to me. I love to travel by myself there\xB4s a liberty\
  \ of body, mind and soul that feels really good and specially for a woman to fell\
  \ secure in a situation like that it\xB4s something to celebrate. Ouro Preto made\
  \ me celebrate me. I\xB4m sure I didn\xB4t see half of the beauties that lives in\
  \ there and certainly it made me want more so I kind of made a bet to myself in\
  \ certains stones of the city I got my name there I could not pass more than 2 years\
  \ to return otherwise my name could vanish from that stone forever and that directly\
  \ would afected me. The same aura of mysticism that sorounds that place made me\
  \ find that kind of mysticism in me. I don\xB4t know what that could lead me years\
  \ from now but certainly increased my perception of how travels changes us, it\xB4\
  s an oportunity to actually grow and try to learn and live different things. The\
  \ ideia of not just see the comun places but actually talk to people, get lost in\
  \ the streets, ask for help, eat local food, breathe, take a deep breathe and just\
  \ enjoy the moment so that the image itself of it remains tattooed within."
