Text: "I went to Jamaica with a friend anticipating a tropical paradise. What I got\
  \ was an experience I will never forget. \n\nIn typical tourist style, we sailed\
  \ on a catamaran at our all-inclusive resort, went shopping, toured Dunn's River\
  \ Falls, and went horseback riding on the beach. The vacation took a different turn\
  \ when we took a bus to Kingston. Ruby's passport had not arrived by our departure\
  \ date. She was told to go to the American consulate in Kingston, Jamaica and pick\
  \ up paperwork so she could return to the U.S. I had been told Kingston is dangerous.\
  \ I should be careful not to get mugged or worse. I shouldn't go anywhere alone.\
  \  However, as she waited for her turn in the office to get things straightened\
  \ out I decided to wander about.  \"People are just people, \" I said, \"If you\
  \ treat them right they will usually treat you right.\" I only walked a few blocks\
  \ just to see what I could see. I must have been a VERY out of the ordinary sight\
  \ because I did get some stares and strange looks. I just smiled and kept walking.\
  \ And NO-ONE bothered me! Whether I am naive or brave I don't know. I just know\
  \ that every time I have gone somewhere where I am told it is dangerous and a little\
  \ white woman should be afraid, I find nothing but indifference or kindness. This\
  \ day was no different. I returned unharmed.\n\nUnfortunately, Ruby's paperwork\
  \ would not be ready until the next day. We would have to either spend the night\
  \ in Kingston or take the bus back and do the trip again tomorrow, something we\
  \ were not prepared for. Ruby suggested we visit an old friend of hers that she\
  \ had been wanting to see.  I was not prepared for where her friend lived. \n\n\
  She took us to a dirt alley between two apartment buildings. It was about ten feet\
  \ wide. It had rained and boards were laid across puddles to allow a person passage\
  \ without walking in the mud. On my right was a small cement pad with a sink and\
  \ a wooden stall with a toilet. A few feet past that was their 'home' made of scavenged\
  \ items; lattice work, odd size boards, corrugated plastic roofing and sheets hung\
  \ where openings were left. Inside were a table and chairs, cement blocks with a\
  \ board across for sitting and stove to cook on. Off to the left was a door leading\
  \ into a building. I found out this was their only true 'room' and served as their\
  \ bedroom. These people were so kind. They fed us, and when night drew near they\
  \ expected us to stay with them. I felt guilty taking from them yet I also felt\
  \ humbled and honored by their generosity.\n\nThey insisted we take the one and\
  \ only bedroom. They slept on the chairs at the table. I could not offend these\
  \ kind people by refusing their hospitality. I have to tell you, I am TERRIBLY afraid\
  \ of mice ... and bugs. As we entered the bedroom a mouse ran across the floor.\
  \ I held in a scream. I would not embarrass or offend them. I saw a roach crawl\
  \ across the ceiling as we lay in bed. In the morning I shook out my clothes before\
  \ getting dressed. Thanking our hosts we made our way back to pick up her paperwork.\
  \ The bus took us back to Montego Bay, back to our luxurious resort with its four\
  \ walls, fluffy pillows, endless buffet, pool, and catamarans. However, despite\
  \ all the luxury of the resort, the tours we took, and the beautiful beaches, what\
  \ sticks with me to this day is the night we spent with people who had next to nothing\
  \ and who gave us their very best expecting nothing in return. \n\nI am so glad\
  \ we took that trip. It was fun. It was shocking. Some parts were sad, but most\
  \ of all I left with a feeling of profound gratitude, awe and thankfulness. Jamaica\
  \ was beautiful. It's people even more so."
