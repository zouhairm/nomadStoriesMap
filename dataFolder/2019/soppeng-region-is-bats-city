Text: "When i was in Makassar City. It's capital city of South Sulawesi Province in\
  \ 2009 from Surabaya, It's capital city of East Java Province. I'd gone here by\
  \ Ship for 3 days. It's the first time i'd travel alone at age 14. It's excited\
  \ to be here and absoutely Makassar is wonderfull city, It has small islands, beach\
  \ and best seafood cullinary ever. \nSo, I'd school at Vocational High School of\
  \ 4 Makassar and learnt Tourism department. So, my class has touring list/year.\
  \ I love traveling to new places, mountain by motorbike although alone or join with\
  \ my friends.\nFor the first time, i'd gone to Soppeng Region. It's 4 hour from\
  \ Makassar. Through 3 Region are Maros, Pangkep and then Bone. Soppeng Region is\
  \ unique because there is city area on small town you will see a lot of bats hang\
  \ on trees even day or night. So, Soppeng know by Bats City.\nYou will see closely\
