Text: "Coming from a small town in South Africa where most people never even dare\
  \ to dream about going overseas I knew that one day I'll get on to a plane and see\
  \ what is at the end of the horizon. I decided to choose Thailand as my first international\
  \ trip because of the price and not having to spend money on a Visa. The culture,\
  \ food, way of life and to actually see the famous Big Buddha. \n\nI did get all\
  \ of that. Everything promised and more. What they don't tell you is how you will\
  \ fall in Love with the people of Thailand. They don't tell you that it's the number\
  \ one place to make new friends from all over the world. \n\nThey don't tell you\
  \ how you will communicate with the locals by just a smile on your face. We decided\
  \ to go to the famous weekend market called the Naka Market. I insisted on us using\
  \ the local bus as I wanted to experience how they people live. I sat next to an\
  \ old lady probably in her eighties. She looked at me for about 2 minutes with the\
  \ biggest smile iv ever seen. She started talking to me in Thai ever so gently and\
  \ holding my hand. All I could say was sawadika which means hello in Thai and K\u0304\
  hxbkhu\u1E47 meaning thank you. \n\nThe journey took about 30 minutes and this lady\
  \ kept on talking to me. All I managed to say was \"Naka Market\" and my attempt\
  \ of sign language that I'll going there. Which brought her to stitches. She said\
  \ yes yes yes. As the journey continued she became my personal tour guide. Pointing\
  \ out different areas as we journeyed to my destination. She looked at me with so\
  \ much love and understanding. The bus turned and came to a stop. She said to me\
  \ Market pointing the direction I had to walk. Followed by a go go go. She said\
  \ bye bye and followed it with what sounded like an I love you. I was taken back\
  \ by her. \n\nHer eyes were filled with joy and care. As I stepped out of the bus\
  \ I realized how what had just happened to me would never make it to a travel guide.\
  \ But that was what Thailand is to me. The old lady on my way to the Market. I call\
  \ her Love. \n\nI am lucky to have met her for she made me believe that there is\
  \ still good in this world. She didn't ask for anything. All she did was hold my\
  \ hand. I experienced the most precious gift of all. True humanity.\n\nI knew from\
  \ that moment that traveling all the way to South Africa to Thailand was the best\
  \ decision I have ever taken. \n\nThailand is everything and more. I call her Love."
