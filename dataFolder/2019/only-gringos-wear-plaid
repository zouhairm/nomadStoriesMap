Text: "In the great, white northern winters of Vermont, the flannel shirt is iconic.\
  \  We wear them instead of bathrobes, layer them to run out and check mail in sub-zero\
  \ temperatures, throw them on to shovel a walking path through yet another foot\
  \ of snow.  There are always several on hooks by the door to grab as needed.  My\
  \ husband refers to his favorite red and black plaid as his \u201Chouse frock\u201D\
  .  When spring finally arrives, I want to burn it, having seen it almost daily for\
  \ six months.  \n\nMuch as we love the beauty and lifestyle enjoyed in our home\
  \ state, we look forward to getting the heck out of winter for a week each year.\
  \  Usually, we like to sit on a beach in the Florida sun and just soak up Vitamin\
  \ D, replenishing depleted stores.  This year, we sought something off-the-beaten-path.\
  \  We ventured instead to Valle de Bravo, Mexico.  I packed my flannel because,\
  \ well, months of cold and stoking a wood stove can make you think that sweating\
  \ is not a real thing.\n\nValle de Bravo is a popular destination for wealthier\
  \ Mexicans and one can see why.  Only 2.5 hours drive away from Mexico City, the\
  \ change from arid and smoggy to green and lush starts to happen almost as soon\
  \ as you turn off the highway and begin the descent into this valley.  \n\nExiting\
  \ industrial Toluca, you drive through open country, passing hundreds of small farms\
  \ and villages growing wonderful fruits and vegetables.  The topography begins evolving\
  \ to rolling hills.  As the road gets more winding and steep, you glimpse Lake Avondaro,\
  \ which the village of Valle de Bravo overlooks.  My husband\u2019s family once\
  \ had a villa here and he has young-child memories of tortillarias and heladerias.\
  \  Easy enough to rent a small, private villa on Air BnB, this enabled us to \u201C\
  live\u201D there for the week.  \n\nMorning in Valle, and probably every Mexican\
  \ town, begins at dawn with a chorus of a thousand roosters, followed by the conversation\
  \ of a hundred dogs.  Layers to the orchestra become motorbikes, church bells and\
  \ children\u2019s voices.  The evenings add mariachi.  \n\nWe walked down our hill\
  \ daily on cobblestone streets to town, with its whitewashed buildings and red-tiled\
  \ roofs.  We wandered the open-air market, dialoguing in Spanish with the vendors,\
  \ who introduced us to new fruits.  We sipped cold, tropical juices and watched\
  \ families and teens doing the same in the cathedral square.  On cooler mornings,\
  \ and there were some, I wore my plaid.  I began to realize the locals were looking\
  \ at me funny, and that it was about my shirt...   \n\nFood here is simple and done\
  \ well, as each vendor does their one thing.  We couldn\u2019t top the roasted chicken\
  \ from the street vendors, so we didn\u2019t try.  These became the base for much\
  \ of our own experimental cooking---going into stews and tortillas.  Fresh limes,\
  \ tomatillos, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes and cilantro were used variously, always\
  \ with Valentina hot sauce.  Blackberries, strawberries, mangoes and guava, picked\
  \ fresh in-season, were moan-worthy.  Better than we EVER get at home.  We picked\
  \ oranges and lemons from trees in the backyard.  Oh, it was heaven!  This was just\
  \ the color, flavor and nutrient infusion we were so missing in the land buried\
  \ under white. \n\nEach day we walked for miles, seeing the village sights, smelling\
  \ its scents, stopping for cervezas.  We photographed colorful bougainvillea and\
  \ Volkswagon beetles.  We happened upon unique depictions of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\
  \  We sat at-length, silent, in the two very different cathedrals:  one with its\
  \ beautifully carved Christo Negro, the other with its colorful frescoes and \u201C\
  peeking Jesus\u201D.  Puzzling was that the churches\u2019 wide open doors and proximity\
  \ to bustling community were in contrast to houses typically walled and gated. \
  \ Houses are private, but God is accessible\u2026\n\nReturning to the airport, we\
  \ were waiting at the gate when I looked up and watched the approach of two travel-weary,\
  \ English-speaking women with backpacks.  Each was wearing a plaid shirt.  At that\
  \ moment, it dawned on me that I hadn\u2019t seen another since our arrival---no\
  \ snow, no Americans and no flannel in Valle de Bravo.  Perhaps, I thought to myself,\
  \ only gringos wear plaid."
