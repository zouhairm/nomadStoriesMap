Text: "Before going off travelling by myself, of course I\u2019d heard the phrase:\
  \ it\u2019s not about the places you see, it\u2019s about the people you meet on\
  \ the way. I\u2019m not entirely sure I\u2019d agree with that statement, even now,\
  \ after half a year abroad. Which is not to say I want to diminish the novelty of\
  \ meeting a friendly soul, quite the opposite. The most kind hearted, adventurous\
  \ people I\u2019ve met here were those on tramping tracks. When recently I hiked\
  \ to Mueller Hut - hiking being a nice descriptor, the way up starts out with thousands\
  \ of steep, stair case steps and continues on a rocky route - as usual, I questioned\
  \ my life choices, sweating under the unagreeable sun on the three hour way up,\
  \ in particular why I decided to do this, -until I reached the red hut, perched\
  \ on stilts just before the summit, overlooking a chain of dark, grey mountains,\
  \ tops covered in snow. I filled up my waterbottle and turned my face to the sun\
  \ and the glinting surface before me. With the sunrise, I thought, and the morning\
  \ light reflecting off of the glacier, it must be quite a view. There were quite\
  \ a lot of people up here and we could hear snow slides rolling down the mountains\
  \ and occasionally even see the snowy dust they left in their wake. When I finally\
  \ made my way back to the campsite, I came across a group on their way down as well.\
  \ As an answer to how they were doing, the collective answer was, good but thirsty.\
  \ So, without giving it a second thought, I offered them my bottle, since I knew\
  \ how annoying it is to feel that dry throat the whole time. I was so surprised\
  \ by how grateful they were, and how unexpected my offer was. To me, it didn\u2019\
  t really matter, I had plenty to drink anyway, and to them it made such a difference.\
  \ The encounter, amusing as it was to me, made me remember my first overnight hike,\
  \ which I attempted rather unprepared. So unprepared in fact, that I was shivering\
  \ cold in the evening and throughout the night and heavily disamused in the morning,\
  \ when I found I hadn\u2019t packed enough breakfast. I still climbed to the summit\
  \ for sunrise, the sole reason I started the adventure in the first place, and when\
  \ I came back to the hut, I was impressed by the beauty of the sun creeping out\
  \ over the forest covered mountains and the ocean in the distance, but my hands\
  \ were so cold I couldn\u2019t feel anything anymore and my stomach grumbled so\
  \ loud, I felt I disturbed the mountains pristine silence. In that condition, my\
  \ fellow hut members discovered me, an outspoked British couple, and a lovely, lively\
  \ American. They took one fleeting look at me and offered me to join them, they\
  \ had enough bread, tea and eggs to not only feast on themselves, but to feed me\
  \ as well. Feeling overwhelmed by their kindness, I asked whether they were sure\
  \ about five times, but they assured me, that yes, there was plenty, and otherwise\
  \ they\u2019d have to carry it down anyway. In that way I had the best (heart and\
  \ gut warming) breakfast of all times and made some friends for the time we spent\
  \ hiking together. To me, their offer and company transferred this hike into the\
  \ most memorable one I\u2019ve done, for the beauty of nature and of the people\
  \ along the way, who made me able to appreciate the environment and I\u2019ve nothing\
  \ but fond memories. To them, I will probably stay the slightly weird lay-woman\
  \ of a hiker they met one time or another. Their help, appartenly meaning not much\
  \ to them, made all the difference to me, and although I won\u2019t even pretend\
  \ that me offering that group water comes even close to recieving a hot breakfast,\
  \ I hope that in the adventures of my life and travelling, I will be able to touch\
  \ peoples lives in such a meaningful manner as mine will be touched by them."
