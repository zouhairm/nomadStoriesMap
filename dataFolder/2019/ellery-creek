Text: "The flies at Ellery Creek Big Hole feel like they\u2019re trying to eat the\
  \ flesh off your bones. In February, it\u2019s 40 degrees in the day across most\
  \ of the Northern Territory and just about the temperature where it\u2019s tolerable\
  \ to sleep in your car at night. When I arrived I had the place to myself. Although\
  \ this meant a few delicious hours of listening to the cavernous echoes of my toes\
  \ in water, it also meant no one to distract the buzzing creatures digging out homes\
  \ in my tear ducts. I tied a handkerchief around my neck, over my head covering\
  \ my entire face and tied the corners in the opposite direction. I looked like a\
  \ matchstick wearing a bikini and saw the entire day through a pink paisley filter,\
  \ but they bothered me less. \n\nIt meant that for the first half hour of our acquaintance,\
  \ Pedro didn\u2019t see my face. I saw him look inquisitively up and down my body\
  \ though, while I offered to take a photo of him in front of the view and he offered\
  \ to rub sunscreen on my back. For a moment I wondered if he was planning to whisk\
  \ me away to some hidden cave, but this isn\u2019t going to be that kind of story.\
  \ Instead, he undressed to his boxers and lay next to me on the microfibre towel\
  \ I leant him. His body was strong and compact, condensed into a careful image that\
  \ belonged in 2003. His broad back was black with flies, on his stomach there was\
  \ a tattoo of Chinese characters and a silver bar through his left nipple. Later,\
  \ he would ask me if I had one too and I\u2019d laugh and say that it was just cold.\
  \ \n\nHe was shy and seedy at the same time, suggesting we swim naked one minute\
  \ and awkwardly looking to me for cues the next. The language barrier confounded\
  \ him, and I wondered what kind of man he was in his mother tongue; whether I was\
  \ getting more or less of the full view of him, stripped of words like this. When\
  \ he couldn\u2019t find a word, he tended to give up on the idea, leaving us prone\
  \ to lingering silences and unfinished conversations.\n\nThe Big Hole is precisely\
  \ that, two steep faces of rock plunge together far below the surface \u2013 the\
  \ ancient force of their meeting reverberating. The walls are ruggedly dimpled and\
  \ marbled with grey and signature desert red. The space between is filled with cloudy\
  \ water so deep that when someone died there a few years ago, it\u2019s said, it\
  \ took three days to find the body. \n\nI had swum through the valley before Pedro\
  \ arrived with frequent, often verbal, reminders to myself that there were not (definitely\
  \ not) crocodiles here. Striking out alone, green shadows faded to black, I filled\
  \ my belly with air and floated for a moment above the deepest part. I felt the\
  \ water support me on every side, as if holding me in its palm and willing me to\
  \ look up. The rock framed my view, sprinkled with sharp-edged gum leaves and giving\
  \ way to a searing desert sky. I soaked in the feeling, so common on that trip,\
  \ of being alone and connected at once. I let the breath out. \n\nI grasped a few\
  \ moments of this when I swam out with him too. He took a lot of convincing about\
  \ the water. I flitted around him turning somersaults and leaping off rocks, more\
  \ that a little enjoying my role as intrepid guide to my hyper-masculine companion.\
  \ We chatted in our disjointed way about hunting for mermaids, shapes we saw in\
  \ the rock, his mysterious career as an \u2018entrepreneur\u2019. He mostly sat\
  \ on the rock, stoically enduring the flies. \n\nWe spent the day like this, in\
  \ our strange companionable solitude. But, when we found ourselves facing each other\
  \ in the declining light he turned away. There was no peck on the cheek or even\
  \ awkward hug, no exchange of details or insincere promises. I would overtake a\
  \ car thirty minutes down the sparse highway, 30km/h below the limit and wobbling\
  \ dangerously over to the right, and wonder if it was him."
