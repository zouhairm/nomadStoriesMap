Text: "We shouldn\u2019t be here. \n\L\nI call those four words to my husband over\
  \ the grassy knoll we explore along the Golden Circle in Iceland, words that I wouldn\u2019\
  t have said two days ago. Words that he wouldn\u2019t have heeded two days ago.\
  \ Yet, looking both unnerved and awed, he mutters a quiet apology and pulls me back\
  \ down the path to the crater we left behind.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find a\
  \ whole other World hidden amongst the varied landscapes of Iceland, but an afternoon\
  \ of conversation over jam-filled pancakes at Reykjavik\u2019s Elf School changed\
  \ how I experienced the isolated volcanic island. \n\nSitting under flickering florescent\
  \ lights in an out-of-place desk on the second level of a strip mall, I\u2019m unsure\
  \ of what I\u2019m getting myself into. All I have is written down is \u201Csecond\
  \ floor\u201D and there\u2019s nothing to indicate I\u2019ve found Elf School. I\
  \ almost leave when it\u2019s headmaster, Magnus Skarphedinsson, opens the door\
  \ with his rosy cheeks, full beard and offbeat humour. He welcomes us into his World,\
  \ a crowded apartment of books, figurines, artifacts, household items and dust that\
  \ all speak to the folklore that he hunts. \n\nI feel like I might be in a holy\
  \ place beneath the watchful eyes of the fairy and elf figures that fill the room\
  \ and the old church scent that surrounds us, a strange combination of dust, books\
  \ and coffee. Study books in hand, Magnus begins with a reverence and passion for\
  \ his subject that is rarely seen in professors anymore. \n\nHe puts a pot in our\
  \ hands, explaining how a hidden person gave it to one of the women he interviewed\
  \ as he notes emphatically that there are no \u201Cmade in China\u201D markings\
  \ or anything to indicate that it\u2019s of our World. \n\nHe tells us of one Icelander\
  \ who got caught in a storm and was welcomed into a neighbour\u2019s home for a\
  \ warm meal and comfortable sleep. He returned to thank them for their hospitality,\
  \ only to find nothing there. \n\nInterestingly, the tales he tells aren\u2019t\
  \ grand. They aren\u2019t the Norse legends of Thor or epic tales of magic as you\
  \ may expect. It\u2019s a voice yelling at a child to get off a rock, a stranger\
  \ warning a fisherman of a storm, a missing cow borrowed for it\u2019s milk and\
  \ returned, an elf stepping in as a midwife and providing coffee. \n\nThis is perhaps\
  \ why 54 percent of Icelanders believe in the existence hulduf\xF3lk (the hidden\
  \ folk)\u2014 the stories are about the experience of living amongst the unforgiving\
  \ wilds of Iceland. From the raging seas to the moss-covered lava fields to the\
  \ sprawling glaciers, Icelanders have made a home in an environment not many could\
  \ claim. And they\u2019ve thrived, perhaps with a little help from these beings.\
  \ \n\nThe next day, we set out on the popular Golden Circle route to take in geysers,\
  \ craters and the Silfra fissure where the Eurasian and North American Tectonic\
  \ plates slowly rip apart from each other year-by-year. \n\nWe\u2019ve already seen\
  \ ice caves, black sand beaches and more, but something is different today. With\
  \ Magnus\u2019 deep chuckle in mind, we no longer just look at the views. We wander\
  \ through the wilds, trying to see beyond. \n\nWhen you slow down, there\u2019s\
  \ an energy to Iceland. Maybe it\u2019s all the lava churning below or the negative\
  \ ions flying from all those waterfalls, but Iceland truly feels different. It\u2019\
  s somehow fitting that a country straddling two continents may also straddle two\
  \ Worlds. \n\nSo when I stumble into a strange moss-covered circle with formations\
  \ that look strangely like doors and mounds of sticks that somehow resemble little\
  \ welcome mats, I feel like an intruder. I feel like I\u2019m walking through a\
  \ place I shouldn\u2019t be, a home I can\u2019t see. \n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be here,\
  \ I say. \n\nIceland is a placed of untouched beauty, a natural paradise that we\
  \ have not sought to tame. When I first planned my vacation there, I thought it\
  \ might be because of the isolation or because of the small population of only about\
  \ 330,000 people on the island. But now? \n\n\LI think that Icelanders have a gift\
  \ for not just looking, but truly seeing."
