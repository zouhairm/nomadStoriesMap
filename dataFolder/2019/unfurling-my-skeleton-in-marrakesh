Text: "I chase the sun again, this time to Morocco. I hate winter. I hate the cold,\
  \ the grey, the way all the nature in Paris feels dead and I feel lifeless with\
  \ it. I can bear winter during Christmas, when everything glows beautiful in red\
  \ and green and gold. But when the new year comes I feel the irritation of hosting\
  \ a guest who won\u2019t leave. Come on, I want to shout into the icy wind. You\
  \ have outstayed your welcome. I have no more tea or cake. \n\nMy anxiety is frantic\
  \ in the few weeks before I go to Marrakech. I am terrified by the thought of going\
  \ to a busy unfamiliar city alone. I have travelled alone before- in Europe and\
  \ to China, with tranquil complacency. But for the first time I feel inexplicably\
  \ vulnerable. \n\nWhat if I get lost, what if I get harassed, what if my belongings\
  \ get lost or stolen. I consider not going. Then I consider bringing my sister with\
  \ me. But ultimately, I know that it will do me only good to go alone, to prove\
  \ that my worries have no grounding in reality. That I will go and I will have a\
  \ fine time and I will return empowered because I looked anxiety in its face and\
  \ I said You are just a ghost. You are made only of smoke and if I blow hard you\
  \ will swirl off away into the wind. \n\nAnd in the end, that\u2019s exactly what\
  \ happens. \n\nIn Marrakesh I soak the sun into my cells like a leaf in photosynthesis.\
  \ I wish that I could unfurl my skeleton from my body and lay it out underneath\
  \ the blue sky to bake. My sadness and my worries flow down back down into the red\
  \ earth and I wonder if they were simply the product of a hostile environment. \n\
  \nThe city reminds me a lot of Delhi- same frenetic beat, same noise and dust, same\
  \ chaotic traffic. I visit a few major sites, but they are crowded with tourists\
  \ which I don\u2019t like. I have always maintained that the only way to really\
  \ know a city is to walk through it. I walk ten or fifteen miles each day and so\
  \ I feel justified in eating while I walk. I eat yellow custard tarts and round\
  \ pastries inflated with air and chocolate, purchased from street counters covered\
  \ in happy wasps. When I travel in Europe I can\u2019t often afford restaurant meals.\
  \ But the food in Marrakesh is good and cheap. I am grateful for the luxury of eating\
  \ well and drinking sugary mint tea. \n\nI feel entirely safe and I feel silly for\
  \ worrying about feeling otherwise. It\u2019s very touristy- for me, too touristy.\
  \ But I am happy and rather smug because the way that I look means I can blend in\
  \ quite well in many countries. When vendors in the street try to talk to me and\
  \ sell me things our conversations are good natured, and I am laughing rather than\
  \ annoyed. After a few 'Non merci's, or an explanation of my ethnic origins to the\
  \ curious, I am left alone to wander. \n\nThe hostel is managed by two lovely guys\
  \ not much older than me. They tell me they are Berbers from the same village near\
  \ the Sahara, and that they came to Marrakesh for work.  I ask them if they like\
  \ the city but they say no with a frankness which makes me laugh. 'Too noisy, too\
  \ pushy', they say.\n\nAt nights I sit on the roof with them and the friends that\
  \ they invite over, men from their village, who work in the city as taxi drivers\
  \ and hotel staff. I sit with quiet contentment as they talk in Berber and chain\
  \ smoke Gauloises. The hostel isn\u2019t licensed to serve alcohol. The men offer\
  \ me tea from a beaten silver pot and laugh when I realise it is beer. 'In case\
  \ anyone comes', they say. I play Drake from someone\u2019s phone. Then we sit and\
  \ we drink cold beer and eat sweet cake underneath a vast starred sky."
