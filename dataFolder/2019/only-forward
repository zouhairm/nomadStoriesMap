Text: "No, nothing is more beautiful for a small child, who has never seen anything\
  \ but his home, to go on a journey. Yes, everything seems incredible to him, but\
  \ in a rather children's fantasy and reality merge into one, and the surrounding\
  \ landscape is not at all impressive, I want to go home. It is much better to travel\
  \ in a more conscious age, when you can fully realize all the magnificence of what\
  \ is happening, and your heart, like the mind, remembered your own home. It happened\
  \ to me. A long wait for something that could drive one crazy, but I waited and\
  \ soon I had the chance to finally get out of my native nest and see the world,\
  \ or rather its small part.\nPreparing for the trip is no less exciting, as is the\
  \ trip itself. So much to think about and forget nothing. You try to listen to all\
  \ the instructions as closely as possible, but soon you realize that your thoughts\
  \ are already far away ... Finally, when the suitcase is packed and there is no\
  \ more strength to wait, the day comes. And it seems that everything is fine, you\
  \ are going to the sea, but the heart asks to stay at home, it is too hard for him\
  \ to say goodbye to the family. I get on the bus, smile at my relatives and close\
  \ the window with a curtain, a tear is rolling down my cheek. Finally, all the passengers\
  \ in their seats and we can go. On such trips, I always try to distract myself with\
  \ something: I listen to music, read a new book or sleep.\nThe most terrible test\
  \ becomes stuffiness. The hot sun bakes outside, and the stale air interferes with\
  \ breathing inside. Droplets of sweat roll on the skin, and the air conditioner\
  \ refuses to work. One can only hope that it will end soon. And indeed, the day\
  \ gradually replaces the night. The temperature drops, the air cools, it becomes\
  \ easier to breathe at once, and therefore, to think soberly. With each kilometer\
  \ we are getting closer to the south, but the landscape is not becoming more diverse,\
  \ all the same fields and forests ...\nAt night, I realize that the heat of the\
  \ day was not so bad, the evening coolness is much worse. My legs and hands begin\
  \ to freeze, because I am going in shorts and a t-shirt. I'm trying to warm myself\
  \ up somehow, rubbing my limbs. Soon I understand that my legs are beginning to\
  \ go numb, after all the day without movement was not in vain. At each stop I try\
  \ to go out to warm up, and I have to endure the cold. At dawn, I buy myself coffee\
  \ at a roadside cafe, and my condition improves markedly. Soon the fields are replaced\
  \ by hills, and they, in turn, mountains. I understand that Gelendzhik is already\
  \ close and my heart is filled with trepidation. Sitting on the ground is no longer\
  \ possible, I want to rush out to the sea as soon as possible, but it\u2019s impossible,\
  \ and there isn\u2019t it on the horizon.\nFinally, we drove into the city, and\
  \ I managed to see the sea out of the corner of my eye, but fatigue makes itself\
  \ felt, and I decide that it would be wiser to rest at the hotel first. Throwing\
  \ the bags on the floor, I tumble down on the bed. Feet sore insanely, and eyes\
  \ stick together, which means you need to sleep. After sleep, I quickly take a shower\
  \ and change clothes, it's time to go to the sea. With my mother, I walk through\
  \ the wide streets of the city. There are both tanned people and not very much.\
  \ We immediately see that we are at sea the first day (and for the first time in\
  \ our life). The eye is not enough to consider everything, but I want to quickly\
  \ go to the sea. And here it is. Huge and blue as the sky, extending for many kilometers\
  \ ahead. I could hardly restrain myself so as not to scream with delight that overwhelms\
  \ me. I walk on the hot sand and slowly go into the water. The warm sea gently caresses\
  \ tired legs. After making sure that the water is warm enough, I dive. Salty water\
  \ immediately flows into my nose, which makes me feel so good ...\nAs a small child,\
  \ I look at every house, every shop window with delight. All images smash into memory,\
  \ but the smell becomes the most memorable. I still remember him. It is a mixture\
  \ of salty air, light smell of needles, because Spruces were planted in the courtyard\
  \ of the hotel, and wine and chacha vapors were planted. Places where these drinks\
  \ were pushed were at every turn. But we passed by one such place daily, without\
  \ buying anything there, but enjoying this sweet, intoxicating smell. That is why\
  \ traveling is better at a conscious age. The child can not remember everything,\
  \ he sees only individual fragments that are stubbornly unwilling to form a whole\
  \ picture. I remember everything, and the house of horrors, and the ship, which\
  \ went out into the open sea, and the mountains, to the top of which they stopped\
  \ in a jeep, and much more. All this will remain in my memory forever, not only\
  \ because I have already grown, but also because I first left so far from home where\
  \ there is no this salty smell with the scent of pine needles and chacha, which\
  \ I remember so much."
