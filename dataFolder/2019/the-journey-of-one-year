Text: "I lived in a tropical paradise for most of my life.  With its curves transcending\
  \ like the topology of a snake and the ubiquitous feel of the trade winds beating\
  \ against my face. This isle was enough to quench the desires of one thousand souls.\
  \ Yet I longed to breathe the air of a new plain, to journey for the first time,\
  \ beyond the granular spheres of white stained sand.\n\nThe trotting sounds of the\
  \ jumbo jet\u2019s wheels, was a sign of my leap forward.  With my best friend at\
  \ my side, and tactile and olfactory senses intact, I was prepared. The flight over\
  \ the Atlantic was magnificent.  I was fascinated by the altitude and the tremendous\
  \ display of light, transitioning between time zones. As the plane landed, a gush\
  \ of cold hit my body like the dawn of the ice age. No longer was I in Tobago. My\
  \ journey to one thousand places had begun.\nHustling to secure our train tickets,\
  \ we sluggishly tugged towering bags. \u201CYou must get to the platform now!\u201D\
  \ the conductor said, \u201Cget the Gatwick express!\u201D\n\nI stood akimbo, as\
  \ this bellowing metal giant approached, for it was my first time seeing a train.\
  \ As the train pushed forward the landscape was dismal and dull. Filled with hues\
  \ of brown, white and grey. It seemed to cry for excitement and drive. \nMy attention\
  \ was fixed on the computer-generated voice that dominated the atmosphere of the\
  \ train.  \u201CMind the gap between the train and the platform!\u201D  \nAs children\
  \ would, we payed attention to each stop and awaited our final destination, the\
  \ Victoria Train Station. \n\nMomentarily standing still, I noticed the push and\
  \ bustle of the station. It was both frightening and energizing and my feet begged\
  \ to be part of the haste. Walking towards the exist we stepped our feet for the\
  \ first time on the actual soil of the city. I breathed the chill of the atmosphere,\
  \ the sound, the sights, the buses, the people. The city of London came alive before\
  \ my eyes. \n\nEverything was new and I relished in the excitement. The city of\
  \ Westminster was plastered on every street corner and the sight of Clap-ham omnibuses\
  \ were to my excitement.\nIt took only a few weeks for me to become versed at the\
  \ TFL system. This was my new private vehicle and my first ride underground was\
  \ argued to be my last. Its hub of interchanging services and color coded lines\
  \ made me shiver with confusion. Feelings of claustrophobia and imminent death was\
  \ my take; and I affirmed never to travel on this devil again.\n\nVisiting the river\
  \ Thames dazzled my eyes. The beauty of the strip and the melting pot of activities\
  \ tickled emotions in me I never knew existed. It was sharp in view and colorful\
  \ in appeal. I was transcended beyond what was even possible. \nOxford street created\
  \ an aura of fashion and entertainment. Confusion and grandeur, mystique and curiosity\
  \ added to the notorious nature of this street.  China town was of great significance\
  \ with towering buildings adorned with Chinese memorabilia. \n\nI was impressed\
  \ by the openness of Londoners. Their love for all types and races, all images and\
  \ faces. It was beautiful that this big city could suck you in and release only\
  \ with love. With an ice-cream treat in hand, I would sit for hours watching happiness,\
  \ love, misery and indifference pass by.  \n\nFood is not a forbidden feature. From\
  \ the likeness of Turkish tea to lamb chop stew. Lebanese bread and authentic hummus.\
  \ Mexican wraps and spicy chilli rice to West African stew. Thai curry and Vietnamese\
  \ noodles. Scores of British pudding and feasts. The journey to one year aboard\
  \ was filled with the idea of new food. \n\nMy travels were only as good as the\
  \ people I met along the way and I relished in the incredible stories and experiences\
  \ shared. \n\nMy life changed dramatically during my journey of year abroad. I become\
  \ a Londoner; without warning, without need. I was no longer the girl who craved\
  \ coconuts or the warm grace of the Caribbean Sea. I longed to people watch all\
  \ walks of life, perched neatly on a concrete slab in Trafalgar Square."
