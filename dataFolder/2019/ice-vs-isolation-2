Text: "Warmth in the coldest of places. Connection where my phone had none. Two things\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to find atop an Icelandic glacier I was afraid to attempt\
  \ pronouncing. \n\nWhile the icy ground in our vicinity bore indentations and markings\
  \ from the \u2018crampons\u2019 we were made to don, all that was visible in the\
  \ distance was untouched pristine whiteness. \n\nExploring the ice caves of one\
  \ of Iceland\u2019s must-see glaciers, \u2018Braydermerkuryokutt\u2019, presented\
  \ more difficulties than learning its less than foreigner-friendly title. It began\
  \ with the precarious journey down make-shift steps of ice, holding on to a thin\
  \ rope that looked far from sturdy, digging our heels in with all that we had. \n\
  \nMy parents, teenage brother and I had set out on a half-day tour that included\
  \ a mini-van, which trundled us and about 20 other tourists, high up on to the glacier.\
  \ Despite having explored three remarkable, naturally formed ice caves together,\
  \ we had interacted with them minimally. This was soon to change. \n\nThe sputtering\
  \ engine and repeatedly flashing lights of the van were the first indicators that\
  \ something was amiss. \u201CNothing for you to be worried about\u201D, remarked\
  \ our chirpy Icelandic driver and guide, while shooting furtive glances at his two\
  \ assistants. Worried or not, neither the van nor us would be leaving the glacier\
  \ anytime soon. \n\nWe stood in huddles of the groups we\u2019d arrived in, with\
  \ the few individual stragglers left to the comfort of their heat-tech layers for\
  \ warmth. After a few attempts at jumpstarting the vehicle, our guides turned their\
  \ attention to keeping us entertained, while one undertook the long trek back to\
  \ base to source for help. \n\nThe funny thing about being surrounded by nothing,\
  \ is that the people around you become your everything. One minute into a chat with\
  \ the petite Taiwanese girl next to me, I found out she studies at the same university\
  \ as my best friend. Five minutes later, the couple who sat in front of us in the\
  \ van revealed they were, \u201Cfinally celebrating our honeymoon, five years too\
  \ late!\u201D. \n\nVincent, the forever upbeat driver whose name I had waited this\
  \ long to learn, told us of his multiple run-ins with stars filming Game of Thrones.\
  \ He failed miserably in concealing his excitement and passing this off as just\
  \ another day on the job. \u201CShe looked right at me in the eyes, you know, that\
  \ girl \u2026 the lead girl,\u201D he grinned. \u201CI don\u2019t care about these\
  \ celebrity things but my girlfriend tells me its impressive.\u201D\n\nThe couples\
  \ and trios previously scattered across the slippery ice began to merge into one,\
  \ the resulting shared heat a welcome break from the chilly winds hitting us from\
  \ all directions.\n\nIn a place where my phone could neither be used to call for\
  \ help, nor to post an Instagram story about being #stranded in #Iceland, I found\
  \ myself being eagerly entertained by those around me. The Iphone 20XYZ could have\
  \ been released right then and there, and none of us would have known.\n\nOne minute\
  \ I was inspired by the thirty-year old, freshly divorced woman from Puerto Rico,\
  \ doing the first solo trip of her life across the Nordic region. The next, mourning\
  \ for the young backpacker who had just found out her Shi Tzu back in Ontario hadn\u2019\
  t made it through the night. \n\nI\u2019ve always been told the world was small,\
  \ but it felt tiny that day atop Braydermerkuryokutt, a word we could all say to\
  \ perfection by the time our new van arrived, almost obnoxious in its immaculate\
  \ appearance. \n\n\u2018Ah, now we can get going\u2019, Vincent chirped, a shadow\
  \ of disappointment crossing his face, alike to a student hearing the bell after\
  \ recess.\n\nIn a single file we boarded, the chatter from moments before dying\
  \ down to virtual silence. We settled in and began the rocky journey back, returning\
  \ to our former cliques and flipping open our phones as we reached reception. Leaving\
  \ behind the ice for a place that was perhaps, funnily enough, more isolated."
