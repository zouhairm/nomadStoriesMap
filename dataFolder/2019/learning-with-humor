Text: "I met Amir at a hostel in Seville, Spain and though I'm not sure how we started\
  \ talking, I remember finding him sarcastic and funny- my kind of dude. Earlier\
  \ that day at the start of a walking tour we were all asked to introduce ourselves\
  \ and tell everyone where we were from. Amir introduced himself and said he was\
  \ from Saudi Arabia and I noticed a couple of people's eyes go up in surprise. I\
  \ assumed maybe they had already been there or were planning to go and wanted to\
  \ talk to him. \n\nI can be so naive.\n\nThat night the hostel hosted a pub crawl.\
  \ By this time, Amir and I had already been talking and getting to know each other.\
  \  Though I was tired from the day's events he insisted I come along. After some\
  \ hesitance, I decided it would be nice to experience the nightlife of this gorgeous\
  \ little town. Everything started out great, the weather was warm, everyone was\
  \ getting along, and I was enjoying the cobbled streets and walkways of beautiful\
  \ Seville.  We ended up at a lively bar that was filled to the brim with not only\
  \ travelers but locals alike. Since I was planning on ending my night early I didn't\
  \ join in on the festivities per se, but I was enjoying getting to know the other\
  \ travelers as well as talking to some of the locals. But a bit of libation always\
  \ seems to bring out the curiosity. Those who were quiet during the walking tour\
  \ became talk show hosts after a couple of shots. It was fun watching the transformation\
  \ and there were a couple of people who seemed to have opened up. \n\nAmir and I\
  \ were standing around chatting with some folks when one guy approached us. He put\
  \ his arm around Amir's shoulders in a brotherly one-armed embrace. Amir leaned\
  \ away, surprised by his boldness but the guy leaned in and with his hand on his\
  \ chest said: \" So you're from Saudi Arabia huh?\" Amir looked at him, surprised\
  \ with the \"know-it-all\" tone in his voice. \nYes\" he replied. \n\"Well, this,\"\
  \ he said while gesturing to the city with his hands \"must all be fascinating to\
  \ you.\"  \nMy eyes popped open. I couldn't believe the insinuation. I was waiting\
  \ for what I thought would be a fierce reaction, but instead, Amir looked over at\
  \ me, then looked back at our \"friend\" and said, \"No, we moved out of tents a\
  \ long time ago\". I LAUGHED my ASS off. I couldn't help it. The guy appeared to\
  \ have sobered up pretty quickly, and looking completely embarrassed, walked away.\
  \ Maybe he came to the realization that his question may have been a bit offensive\
  \ and though my reaction probably didn't help I did learn a valuable lesson. My\
  \ reaction would have been different but I learned that not only does it take humility\
  \ to pull through a situation like this but it also takes a good sense of humor.\
  \ This was definitely an unexpected lesson. \n\nThe next morning I saw Amir talking\
  \ to the guy and they seemed pretty engrossed in conversation. I let them talk and\
  \ later on, I spoke to the guy myself. I apologized about my laugh, it may have\
  \ been a bit much but it was all in good intention. He accepted and we talked a\
  \ little about cultural differences. This is why we travel; it is a conduit for\
  \ growth, the best education, and has a lasting impact on the world. And with a\
  \ little humor, it can turn an intense moment into an intriguing lesson."
