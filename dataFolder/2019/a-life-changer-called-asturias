Text: 'I''m a soccer player, I went supposedly to play but the director of the team
  just scammed me with money and he never do the legal documentation for me to stay
  there after de 3 turist months, but in the end now I acknowledge that it wasn''t
  a complete loss, I met this guys one week before Christmas and I was looking just
  party and girls but I never imagine that night I would meet my best friends, my
  brothers better said, so in the part of the trip that lasted 5 months and a half,
  i was tire about the lies of the director of the club so K decided to leave before
  I was in an illegal situation, but the mother of one of my friends I met, Diego,
  she told me to stay in her house, that she had a good connection in sporting gijon
  a better team that the one I was going in first place, so the gave me the tryout
  and I made it, unfortunately i was already in an illegal situation because I stayed
  longer than the permitted time in Europe for a foreigner, but I lost my return flight
  and at that moment I had no money, so Cruzi the mom of my friend told me to stay
  all the time I needed, I was so ashamed and I cry because of such a great person
  I found, evntually we started going out to beautiful places in asturias, everyone
  wanted to hang out with the new mexican in town, I falle in love with a girl, I
  teach my friends about being more social because they where very introverted, I
  teach them how to speak to girls, and they where always helping me with transportation
  and introducing me to new friends all the times we went out, so I made a lot of
  new friends and that places at the beach has always party, so I felt like if I was
  in a season of the tv show skins, just partying, enjoying life, forgetting about
  everything, and I don''t know... in the bottom of my heart I was sad, but I didn''t
  think about that so much bcause all the awesome experiences I was having, waking
  up and watching the ocean from my window, knowing beautiful girls, hanging out with
  my best friends Sire, Diego, Juan, Richi, Claudia, Irene, Tania, Patri, every day
  we just go to the mall, a plaza, the Ritz tha is a very good bar at the beach, same
  with la buena vida where all latinos reunite, so I felt like home meeting mor latinos,
  a curious thing was that I was the only mexican there, but anyway, the connection
  with my frineds there was so deep that when I left I cry all the way to Madrid and
  then to Mexico, I never cried for someone a part from my mom the first time a leave
  the country for a long time. Now we keep in touch my friends and I thanks to the
  Instagram video calls, we talk minimun 2 times a week. Now Sire, Juan And Diego
  moved to Zaragoza and they told me that they made that decision because of me, because
  of me they took the courage to get out of their comfort zone and experience in another
  city, and they send me a video of their new house, they have 4 rooms, 1 for each
  one of them and then in the video they showed me the last one and the room had a
  cartel saying: "Reserved for our favorite mexican whenever you come back to Spain"
  that made me feel so happy and lucky to have that kind of friends, and then I realized
  that, yes I lose a lot of money in that trip to Spain, but if that was necessary
  for meeting those frieds, I would gladly spend it again, even the double.

  In the end it doesn''t matter the money, you don''t take anything when you die,
  the important thingsin life are the moments you share with people you resonate and
  feel good with, so yhay trip to Spain make me know the meaning of life.'
