Text: "I\u2019m woken up by the muezzin calling out the prayer from the local mosque.\
  \ I check my phone by the side of my bed and I realise it is only 6am. I\u2019m\
  \ super tired, but I\u2019m also incredibly excited to see what the day has in store\
  \ for us. We arrived in Marrakesh yesterday and we were immediately taken aback\
  \ by the myriad of people, the different sounds and the intriguing smells coming\
  \ at us from all sides. We only have 72 hours here and we are determined to make\
  \ the most out of it, so we make our plans for the day over a breakfast of cumin\
  \ fried eggs and beghrir - pancakes with a million holes. We are staying in a small,\
  \ privately hosted riad with a few rooms, a magnificent courtyard in the middle\
  \ as well as a roof terrace, where the Red City stretches out in front of you as\
  \ far as you can see. Our host is enthusiastic and full of great tips of how to\
  \ fall in love with Marrakesh.  \n\nAfter breakfast we hit the medina and it\u2019\
  s a lot quieter than when we arrived. It almost feels like the Marrakeshi haven\u2019\
  t quite woken up yet and we are too early for the action. The souks are covered\
  \ and we catch glimpses of sunshine through the carved wood roof, which make beautiful\
  \ patterns on the ground. The temperature is mild compared to the chilly, grey London\
  \ we left behind. We see a man setting up his lemon cart on the corner and we walk\
  \ past a singing butcher preparing the meat for his counter. Everyone is going about\
  \ their own business and they don\u2019t seem to mind us too much. We make our way\
  \ further into the souks where we find a little more life. We quickly have to jump\
  \ aside to avoid being run over by one of the many scooters that run through the\
  \ streets. A man walks along with a big thermos offering us Moroccan coffee and\
  \ a bit further down we see another guy on a cart pulled by a mule \u2013 everything\
  \ is just so different to our usual morning commute; it\u2019s hard not to be mesmerised.\
  \ \n\nAs we get to the main square, we stop by a stall selling freshly squeezed\
  \ orange juice \u2013 it is sweet and fresh, and I\u2019m thinking to myself that\
  \ if I could only have this every morning I would be alright! I prefer places off\
  \ the beaten track, but you have to see the main square. It\u2019s super busy, people\
  \ are hustling and trying to sell you the latest designer copies or to get you to\
  \ hold their monkey. We are zigzagging through the crowd and we are soon spotted\
  \ by a group of women attempting to sell us henna tattoos. \u2018I can make you\
  \ beautiful patterns on your hands,\u2019 one says. The other tries, \u2018look\
  \ in my book of designs and pick one \u2013 just look, you don\u2019t have to buy.\u2019\
  \ I stop for a second, not because I want a henna tattoo, but because I get a little\
  \ amused. I pull up the sleeve of my jumper to reveal my arm covered in bright tattoos.\
  \ I look at the woman and say grinning, \u2018I don\u2019t need henna \u2013 I already\
  \ have tattoos.\u2019 She\u2019s astonished by the colours and grabs my arm to inspect\
  \ them further. She asks me whether they are not bad for the skin \u2013 I shake\
  \ my head and smile. She tries again to give me a henna tattoo; \u2018look, try\
  \ just a little on your finger?\u2019 I decline politely and when I do, she pulls\
  \ down her niqab and says in a last sales pitch, \u2018look at me! There are no\
  \ snakes here \u2013 only women!\u2019 The comment takes me a little by surprise,\
  \ but I love her honesty. I walk on, but I\u2019m almost certain I\u2019ll be back\
  \ to have my hands covered in the stunning lacy design she was showing me."
