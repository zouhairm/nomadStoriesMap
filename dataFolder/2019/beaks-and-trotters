Text: "All peoples and cultures love a reason to celebrate and the successful completion\
  \ of a summer camp and the connections we made is certainly no exception. At what\
  \ must have been one of the nicest restaurants in our suburb of Shanghai, we were\
  \ escorted through to a private room at the back. Westernisation might be evident\
  \ in a lot of China, with McDonalds lining the high streets, but here this restaurant\
  \ had been careful to take Western fashions and apply them in a very culturally\
  \ Chinese way. Fairy lights had been intermingled with native trees and plants.\
  \ Traditional lanterns also decorated the room, casting a low but warm light upon\
  \ the room. And, waiting for us, was the sight which every traveller wishes to see:\
  \ large circular tables already lain with food. \n\nDespite having had very little\
  \ verbal communication, the English teachers and the Chinese staff naturally and\
  \ easily intermingled at the tables with much smiling and greeting. Any sense of\
  \ awkwardness having long since been broken down by the English counsellors\u2019\
  \ rendition of Bon Jovi\u2019s \u2018Living on a Prayer\u2019, which involved a\
  \ lot of shouting and air guitar as our contribution to the final ceremony of the\
  \ camp. Side by side we had danced and taught together for the past week; the exuberant\
  \ Han Some, the dance teacher with the hip movement of a cross between Shakira and\
  \ a snake, having led the way and been most eager to learn the versatility and technique\
  \ of the Cha Cha Slide.  \n\nIn such a comfortable atmosphere, and with much help\
  \ from google translate, we were able to communicate how we had enjoyed ourselves\
  \ seeing Shanghai when outside of the classroom. From desperately trying to navigate\
  \ the Shanghai transport system when attempting to catch the last train home and\
  \ ending up at the wrong station to losing my sunglasses in the portion of the Shanghai\
  \ sea which was safe to swim in; the concrete wall a reminder not to stray beyond\
  \ into the toxic runoff of the factories which heralded China\u2019s rise as a modern\
  \ industrial powerhouse. But after this, the sound of china on glass told us all\
  \ that time for conversation had passed and that we should appreciate the individuals\
  \ who had made the past week so enjoyable. John, or so he called himself, rose to\
  \ his feet and raised his glass. \u201CSaul,\u201D he said, speaking to one of my\
  \ colleagues and friends \u201Cyou are beautiful and an excellent man.\u201D Blushing,\
  \ Saul follows in the custom and rises to his feet. Their glasses meet and together\
  \ they drain them. Being tall, with unusually long legs, it is no surprise that\
  \ this was the basis of my compliment, having been a hot topic of conversation all\
  \ week and I do hope that my smile did not convey any sense of weariness as I downed\
  \ the beer which had been generously poured out for me. \n\nAt this point in England\
  \ perhaps there would be a speech and maybe some champagne. Not so in China as a\
  \ very different delicacy awaited us. Amusement and expectation filled the expressions\
  \ of the Chinese staff members as the waiters returned once more, bearing further\
  \ culinary gifts. As we all know from many fateful Christmas mornings, there is\
  \ a very delicate art to appearing grateful when inside all you can feel is shock,\
  \ with perhaps an element of horror. Presented to us were platters of pig trotters\
  \ and, in a special box, duck heads with beaks still attached and still proudly\
  \ carrying the brain. Being told it is an honour and a delicacy is one thing, being\
  \ watched while you try to nibble any meat that you can find off the hard beak whilst\
  \ trying to avoid the juicy innards of the skull is a completely different matter.\
  \ Pleasurable is not a word I would choose to use, and perhaps memorable sums it\
  \ up more accurately. \n\nComing to China, therefore, I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ the generosity and warmth of spirit which I did. I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ camaraderie powerful enough to surpass a strong language barrier. But, above all,\
  \ I certainly didn\u2019t expect to find duck beaks and pig trotters in my dinner."
