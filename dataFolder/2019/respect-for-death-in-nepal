Text: "Last stop of the day is Pashupatinath Temple , consecrated to the God Pashupati\
  \ (manifestation of Shiva), the most important Hindu temples complex in Nepal. \n\
  It extends on both sides of the Bagmati River , considered sacred by Hindus, it\
  \ is part of the 8 monumental groups of the Kathmandu Valley, considered a UNESCO\
  \ World Heritage Site.\nThe main temple is a Nepalese pagoda style with a gilded\
  \ roof, silver-covered sides and wood carvings. The Pashupatinath Temple is the\
  \ oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu but the date of its foundation is not certain\
  \ and there are many legends about it.\n\nThe place is very popular among tourists\
  \ especially for funeral ceremonies that take place daily, with the corpses that\
  \ are cremated on the pyres before the dispersion of the ashes in the Bagmati, a\
  \ tributary of the sacred river Ganges .\n\nWe Westerners think of death as a sad\
  \ and miserable thing; on the contrary, the Hindus consider it simply a ritual to\
  \ alleviate the suffering soul , the Nepalese Hindus believe that cremation is the\
  \ last sacrament in a person's life.\n\nAccording to the Hindu tradition , only\
  \ through a proper ritual of cremation in the temple, their soul can incarnate again.\
  \ The bodies, before being cremated, are stripped and wrapped in orange shrouds,\
  \ stretched along the river bank, bathed several times with the sacred river water,\
  \ perfumed with sandalwood and camphor, finally sprinkled with flower petals.\n\n\
  The men take the stretcher and walk 3 times , clockwise around the wooden funeral\
  \ pyre before placing the body over it. \nOne of the children walks around the pyre\
  \ before lighting the fire from the mouth of the deceased, this is significant because\
  \ the Hindus believe that the spirit of the person is released through the mouth\
  \ and put gold in the mouth to purify the soul.\n\nThe moment the pyre becomes inflamed,\
  \ the body is covered with a mass of wet straw that produces a coat of white smoke.\
  \ Smoke protects the body from sight while the cremation process takes place. \n\
  The family then waits until the body has been completely cremated, the remains are\
  \ then scattered in the river.\n\nAccording to tradition it must be the eldest son\
  \ to set fire to the father, while the minor to the mother.\n\nHeading inside the\
  \ temple complex, one arrives at the Main Temple , accessible to the Hindus, but\
  \ all the other buildings are available to all."
