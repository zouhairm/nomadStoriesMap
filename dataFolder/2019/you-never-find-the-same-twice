Text: "Here I am once again, going to a place for vacations and falling in love in\
  \ such a deep way I decided to make a life. And when I say this I choose to explore\
  \ a place as a world citizen, not as a tourist. Feeling the place as yours and not\
  \ just as a spot for a picture, making memories for ourselves start at the moment\
  \ were you figure out what the place is about to show you about yourself.\nI packed\
  \ my stuffs back in Colombia on July 2nd last year. After a bike accident I was\
  \ looking for a new adventure to heal physically and mentally. They are right when\
  \ they say that if life is going good, you should travel and if life is not going\
  \ so good travel. Even if there is nothing happening, travel is the answer as well.\
  \ So I took this advice seriously since I\u2019m 17, kind of wild, kind of free.\n\
  Every time I go to a new place I want to think out of the box, visit the nontraditional\
  \ touristic places. I don\u2019t want to have the same stories of the average. So\
  \ there you go, I ended up in a town with 800 people, Rio de Los Sauces. Yes, maybe\
  \ four streets, a grocery store, an ice cream shop, a beautiful river, tons of \u201C\
  gauchos\u201D, an adopted dog and a bunch of new friends recognizing me as \u201C\
  the Venezuelan girl\u201D.\nI arrived in the middle of the winter when everything\
  \ is so grey and so cold. But I found myself enough warmed surrounded with this\
  \ doggie and all those new friends. They showed me how is possible to keep traditions\
  \ safe, to be in some way untouchables by the force of modernity. Even for a person\
  \ as me this could be hard to handle sometimes, especially when you think you need\
  \ a fast internet, a mall full of stores, a variety of restaurants, a movie theater\
  \ and a list of \u201Cessential\u201D things to survive.\nFive months later I was\
  \ capable to say \u201CIm glad I didn\u2019t have that\u201D. I had more than ten\
  \ places to eat local real food, and I\u2019m talking about homemade Argentinian\
  \ food. Medialunas, masitas, locro, asado (Im vegetarian for the records), that\
  \ tasty dulce de leche, empanadas, bondiola and more food for the soul than in any\
  \ place where I was before. And to be honest the Argentinian pizza could comfort\
  \ any heart and any soul. That little bomb of calories full of mozzarella cheese,\
  \ french fries and perfect fried eggs could sound like you should go to the doctor\
  \ after the first bite, but you don\u2019t. I guess we can call it nirvana. \nAnother\
  \ thing I wasn\u2019t expecting to find was so many similarities between Venezuelans\
  \ and Argentinians. More than Colombians and Venezuelans even being side by side.\
  \ This was the solid proof for me that we absorb some weird social concepts or ideas\
  \ and the theory goes over the reality. Nothing can replace when you face or touch\
  \ the real facts. So my first new idea, and I always consider ideas as a flexible\
  \ thing, is these two countries share a past of immigration. A strong influence\
  \ from Europeans. So we have lot of similar words, traditions, food and a way to\
  \ see foreigners as family members.\nDecember came and I was a bit afraid. Once\
  \ again, I didn\u2019t expect to find myself so comfy in table with a British, a\
  \ Dutch, another Venezuelan and around 30 Argentinians. Laughs, food, wine, desserts\
  \ and home. Universe is always giving me first class passes in the airplane. I smiled\
  \ and saw around more than three times to realize I was at the right place, in the\
  \ right small town. Where the slow internet wasn\u2019t a priority.\nI moved and\
  \ I\u2019m living now in a bigger town making new stories, making new friends. Confirming\
  \ that life is a series of experiments and experiences. And accepting I didn't expect\
  \ to find myself over and over again. Life is good, the journey is up to you."
