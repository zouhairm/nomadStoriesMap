Text: "Everything I had read and seen about the Len\xE7\xF3is Maranhenses, in the\
  \ state of Maranh\xE3o, was placed in a check. It was more than expected: the ups\
  \ and downs of the small sand mountains carved perfectly by the wind, are lost in\
  \ human sight and are only reconnected after several dives in the clear water lakes\
  \ in the middle of the desert. Desert, incidentally, between the sea - forming unique\
  \ beaches - and the imposing Pregui\xE7a River with its edges full of nature. \n\
  Still on the river Pregui\xE7a, a visit to the island of the monkeys is mandatory.\n\
  Something very cool, to get on the beach, just take a boat by the river, only a\
  \ piece of land separates river and sea. Still can be seen the meeting of the sea\
  \ and the river, beautiful.\nFor the more adventurous, in the city there are paragliding\
  \ parachutes in the desert, motorcycle rentals, surfboards also for the desert.\n\
  At night, there are good choices for fun at the show houses, restaurants and the\
  \ city pier.\nCooking, crafts, are plentiful.\nThe lodging is easily accessible,\
  \ there are hotels and cottages - from the most glamorous to the most simple - as\
  \ well as inns and hostiles.\nThe only thing that rivals the Len\xE7\xF3is Maranhenses,\
  \ the title of unforgettable, is the hospitality and humility of the natives. What\
  \ makes anyone want to return.\nA paradise little known even by the Brazilians themselves."
