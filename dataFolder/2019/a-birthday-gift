Text: "\"Kabi\u2026is this some sort of \"symbolic\" way to welcome your twenties?\
  \ You've done airports alone, you've walked around your city alone, but not -\"\n\
  \nI didn't plan for this. It's happened so quickly: one click and I've booked my\
  \ bus ride, another click and voil\xE0 - I've a bed for the night. The bus leaves\
  \ Paris at 3am on the 4th of May - International Star Wars day, sure, but also my\
  \ birthday. How I've chosen to spend it this year feels like the ultimate self-betrayal:\
  \ not only will I be far away from my friends; but I'm also thrusting myself into\
  \ unknown territory - my first solo trip. \n\n\"Do all the things you're afraid\
  \ to do.\"\n\nMy friend's advice echoes in my head as I attempt to re-inject some\
  \ peace, and maybe excitement, into my veins. My emails call to me: 'your trip is\
  \ tomorrow.' At 11pm, I'm furiously googling 'Dutch greetings'. Then, it's midnight:\
  \ cue the birthday calls.\n\nThe darkness of a cold spring morning in Paris is eerie,\
  \ but once I'm on the bus, I dutifully knock out. Sleep is familiar. I will worry\
  \ about Amsterdam when I get there. \n\nThe bus arrives at the country's capital\
  \ at 11am and luckily, there's wifi enough to lead me to my hostel. Amsterdam's\
  \ buildings are so distinctly skinny and red, and upon entering my hostel, I discover\
  \ that they aren't just skinny on the outside - they are on the inside, too. I'm\
  \ shown to my six-bed dorm room. I wonder if I'll meet any of my roommates. If we\
  \ can be friends. It would be nice to tell someone it's my birthday. \n\nMy ticket\
  \ to the Van Gogh Museum is scheduled for 4:30pm, and I'm grateful that I have at\
  \ least one thing to do in place. When my time there is over, though, I'm walking\
  \ around the streets, pretending to absorb it all in - but really my heart continues\
  \ to beat furiously, unbelieving that I really am in a foreign country alone. I\
  \ feel my body shrinking into shapes it hopes renders it invisible. I check my phone\
  \ out of habit, but I don't have data or wifi so I'm just staring at a blank screen\
  \ for some kind of alleviation from my growing anxiety. \n\nA sign for a canal cruise\
  \ (or a boat tour, as I later find out) comes into view, and I decide to go for\
  \ it. The guide is a wide-shouldered Dutch guy who smokes a grape-flavoured vaporiser.\
  \ As we board, he turns to me. \n\"You should sit in the front so you can understand\
  \ my English better!\" he says. \"How good is your English?\" I tell him it's good\
  \ enough, and he asks where I'm from, and I say Kenya. He asks what our main language\
  \ is, and I say \"English.\" He turns red. \n\nThe only other passengers on the\
  \ boat are a family of three who aren't English speakers, so after two minutes of\
  \ attempting to listen to the guide, they resort to taking pictures of each other.\
  \ It's an interesting tour, and I'm learning a lot about the canals. But what's\
  \ particularly striking to me are the boat houses. Families and friends casually\
  \ have their dinner on a nicely-set up table on the deck of their boat. My thoughts\
  \ float a little as I try to imagine myself living on a boat. Hearing the smooth,\
  \ milky sound of the water as we float by - this is the first time I feel settled.\n\
  \nI spend my next two days in Amsterdam drifting in and out of anxious phases. When\
  \ I'm doing something, I enjoy it, but the unease of not knowing what's next eats\
  \ at my insides. However, the next time I feel calm happens to be when I'm by water,\
  \ again: this time in Zaanse Schans. It's a museum-village outside the capital,\
  \ reminiscent of 19th century Dutch life. It's nothing like the industrious city\
  \ I've left behind. The gentle whirring of windmills swims with the breeze. The\
  \ sun sparkles over the water like little diamonds floating on the surface. It's\
  \ maybe no coincidence that water, again, is what settles my heart. The unknown\
  \ can teach you about yourself so quickly."
