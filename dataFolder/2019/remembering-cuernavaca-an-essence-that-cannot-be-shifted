Text: "\u2018\u2019Me gusta comer\u2026ppperrroo calllliiieennttee?\u2019\u2019 The\
  \ server died of laughter at my 17-year-old self, which I quickly laughed at too\
  \ for my obvious mistake. I asked the server at the local Sam\u2019s, an American\
  \ chain store in Cuernavaca, Mexico for a literal hot temperature dog-animal to\
  \ eat, instead of a \u2018hot dog.\u2019 In this shared laugh, I knew I would have\
  \ a fun month with my host family and the surrounding area where I would build up\
  \ my Spanish skills. If you have never heard of Cuernavaca, 14 years ago when I\
  \ was there, it was a far less popular destination for 20-year-old Americans headed\
  \ to Cancun and more a location for retired Americans buying Mexican property. \
  \ Today, the probable reality is that an increased tick in retirees and uptick in\
  \ Americanization of the country, has made Cuernavaca relatively accessible for\
  \ English speakers in 2019.\n\nThough this is a re-telling of a particular place\
  \ and time, where I was located in Cuernavaca was generally a middle to upper class\
  \ area to live filled with shops, chickens, stray dogs, pretty gardens,  pastel\
  \ colors, high grass filled with quick moving bugs, markets, and buses that never\
  \ actually stopped - you just jumped off hoping your ankle would survive; I would\
  \ like to share the heart of Cuernavacan culture that is an unchangeable aspect\
  \ of the Mexican landscape. The first, is the open cultural flow of the people.\
  \  In my Spanish-English exchange another American girl and I, who could relatively\
  \ pass for people of the area (or Latin American), would have to get over the initial\
  \ assumption by others that our Spanish was far better than what it was (I refer\
  \ you back to \u2018calieennntee peerrooo\u2019).  In the terror and embarrassment,\
  \ along with shy behaviour of these 17 years olds in Mexico, we were always met\
  \ with patience and timelessness. I am from New York City. Patience is not a virtue\
  \ where I am from, so to be in a place where the physical essence and people had\
  \ time to just be with you and not rush for anything, was a stark contrast to my\
  \ experience. If you ever have been to a place like Cuernavaca that is used to dealing\
  \ with Americans, where they do not have to be welcoming, you would be surprised\
  \ by people\u2019s comfort with your American sense of taking up people\u2019s time.\
  \ Time becomes very different in how people socialize and how it becomes a slowdown\
  \ \u2018tempo\u2019 which you can catch in ease of Mexican-Spanish and dialect.\
  \ Time is irrelevant.  \n\nThe second, was my experience with another hosted person\
  \ doing \u2018God\u2019s Work\u2019 as a missionary. A prevalent and historical\
  \ aspect of the Mexican experience, a highly Catholic country, it is unsurprising\
  \ that missionaries continue to develop a foundation in this location that appeals\
  \ to both a Mexican and growing American way of life. Though only a few hours away\
  \ was the far older indigenous histories of Teotihuacan, the location of the Pyramid\
  \ of the Sun and the Moon in the pre-Columbian existence of modern-day Mexico. A\
  \ prime visit of the area, the pyramids are known as having immense power, where\
  \ step by step up the mountain and up the steep hills of the pyramids (which many\
  \ local women do stunningly in heels to please the Gods, themselves, dates, or all\
  \ the above),  are stones at the center point to touch and wish to the Gods to come\
  \ true. I do not remember the wish I asked for from the Gods, but I remember feeling\
  \ Spirit. Whether it was the sun\u2019s perfect alignment to the stone hitting me\
  \ at my Third Eye and Heart  Chakra or the shared energy and experience of the people\
  \ around me; that sensation is always present through the pyramids and earth of\
  \ the people who were always there.  \n\nThis is to say, that no matter how the\
  \ country shifts, no matter how culture shifts, or is re-marketized for an \u2018\
  American eye\u2019; the core of Mexico, the core of Cuernavaca, Teotihuacan;  is\
  \ the sound of language, is the openness of the people, and their ancestors. That\
  \ cannot be shifted. It can also not be taken, but kindly gifted, observed, and\
  \ appreciated by the visitor."
