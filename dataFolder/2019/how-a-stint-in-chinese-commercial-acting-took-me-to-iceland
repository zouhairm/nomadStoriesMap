Text: "I can\u2019t remember how I became friends with Sara on Wechat while I was\
  \ living in Shanghai, but she was one of those people consistently blowing up my\
  \ Moments (like a Facebook feed) with modeling opportunities. I never really responded\
  \ since I was too lazy to get headshots done, but one day out of what seemed like\
  \ desperation, she messaged me asking if I wanted to go to a casting for a Tsingtao\
  \ Beer commercial, saying if I got the part, I would be flown to Iceland for part\
  \ of the shoot. I was still confused if Sara was a real person or not, but went\
  \ to the casting where I had to mutter some words into the camera along the lines\
  \ of, \u201CI can\u2019t wait to take photographs with the penguins one day.\u201D\
  \ It wasn\u2019t my best acting work, but two days later I received another Wechat\
  \ message that I got the part. The first part of the shoot took place in Shanghai,\
  \ at the sceeviest bar they could have found. Myself, a polish girl, and a French\
  \ guy would be the back-packers who were going to Iceland. I had no idea what I\
  \ would be doing until that night at the bar, but when I walked in, the room was\
  \ filled with extras. This was apparently legitimate, and I still couldn\u2019t\
  \ believe it.\n\nA few weeks later, I received a message that my tickets for Iceland\
  \ had been confirmed..for the next day. Filled with trepidation and confusion, I\
  \ just went with the flow, went to the airport, and checked into my flight. When\
  \ the check-in lady handed me my boarding passes onward to Reykjavik, I knew it\
  \ was happening. So I went through security and boarded the flight. 15 hours or\
  \ so later, I was in Iceland. On top of all this, I had forgotten to mention this\
  \ to my work.\n\nBecause we were in Iceland in the dead of December, the period\
  \ in which we could shoot was only 4 hours or so before nightfall would set in.\
  \ After a day of gallivanting around Reykjavik, picking up the producer, driving\
  \ to the glaciers which seemed to be from another planet, we finally began the shoot.\
  \ I had one line, quite similar to the penguin one from earlier where I had to simultaneously\
  \ hold up a beer to the sky. My part took thirty minutes, and while I nearly suffered\
  \ from frost bite while holding up a cold beer without gloves, I was quite satisfied\
  \ with my hours of work-to-pay ratio. This part of the shoot felt pretty unprofessional,\
  \ and considering the commercial has yet to be found on my end, I now know why.\
  \ Anyway, we spent the next day exploring the out-of-world landscapes and waterfalls\
  \ of Iceland, sampling cuisines including reindeer soups, being captivated by the\
  \ aurora borealis, and even trying Iceland's take on Chinese food (which for 50\
  \ euros a dish, I would have expected something exquisite). \n\nBack in Shanghai,\
  \ and with Iceland feeling like a dreamy blur, the god of Wechat, Sara, transferred\
  \ me 5000 RMB, not a single contract signed. Thinking that would be the very end\
  \ of my modeling career, I went back to my day job, no questions asked about my\
  \ few days away from the job. But then a month later, I feel my phone vibrate and\
  \ it's Sara, \"We have an upcoming shoot in Japan, would you be interested?\""
