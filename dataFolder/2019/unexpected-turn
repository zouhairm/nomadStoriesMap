Text: "It is just another beautiful day in South Africa. I woke up early this morning,\
  \ I feel excited. The sun is shining and the first monkeys are coming around looking\
  \ for food. I drink my cup of coffee and I get ready for my day. I have been living\
  \ here for the last few years and I can\u2019t get tired of the amazing views and\
  \ places around me. I put my bikini on and I drive to the beach. I sit at my usual\
  \ spot and I start looking at the sea. It has always given me an immense sense of\
  \ infinity. I\u2019m surrounded by penguins, they are swimming in the sea trying\
  \ to get rid of the strong heat, when a little african kid comes to me. He must\
  \ be around 6, he is skinny but he\u2019s got two deep big black eyes and his nose\
  \ is full of freckles. \u201CSweets?\u201D he asks, politely. I look into my bag\
  \ and there they are. I always have a box full of colourful candies with me, I like\
  \ to eat them when I\u2019m nervous. \u201CThere you are, take them all!\u201D I\
  \ kindly reply. I have never seen such a beautiful smile before. He is looking at\
  \ me, it looks like he doesn\u2019t know how to react in front of such a beautiful\
  \ gift. Then he takes my hand: \u201Ccome with me\u201D he says. I\u2019m a little\
  \ confused but I follow him. He takes me through this little path, full of flowers\
  \ and trees, the monkeys are jumping and playing around. We get to this little village\
  \ and his family is there, waiting for him. The first thing that catches my eyes\
  \ is their house. It\u2019s like a little tent, it looks like they have built it\
  \ by putting every small piece together, just like you do with puzzles. \u201CHi\u201D\
  \ the oldest woman says. She was small, with long grey hair. She smiles and the\
  \ only thing I can see are her white teeth. The little kid shows them the candies,\
  \ like they were his little trophy. I cannot believe how the smallest thing could\
  \ make someone so happy. \u201CWell done little champ! Now get inside and share\
  \ with your brothers!\u201D the old lady says. She must be the grandma, I am thinking.\
  \ He looks at me and after a big smile he runs inside the tent. \u201CThanks a lot\
  \ about that, you know we live far away from the city and it\u2019s very difficult\
  \ for us to make the kids happy with small treats\u201D the woman says to me. \u201C\
  Oh, it\u2019s only a pleasure. I\u2019m glad I made him happy!\u201D I reply. Then\
  \ she goes inside for a second and comes back with a bag. \u201CThere you are, this\
  \ is a small way to say thank you. There are a few fresh products we make from our\
  \ own. It\u2019s hard to live when you don\u2019t have much, but if you have patience\
  \ and kindness, you will always be able to find a way.\u201D She is right, I think.\
  \ These people have created their life from nothing. They don\u2019t care about\
  \ society, they don\u2019t care about money or what other people think or say. They\
  \ have built their life with what they had and they know how to appreciate the little\
  \ things. I left that place with a big sense of joy. I had helped that little kid\
  \ but the truth is that I have learnt so much from his family and him. You don\u2019\
  t need material things to be happy, sometimes we think things just because somebody\
  \ else is indirectly putting those ideas in our minds. The world is beautiful and\
  \ we should respect it and appreciate and love all it has to offer for us."
