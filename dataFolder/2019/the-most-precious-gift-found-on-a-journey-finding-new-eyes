Text: "In December of 2015, I took a leap of faith and traveled to Mytilene, Lesbos.\
  \ I\u2019d never traveled to a place where I didn\u2019t have someone waiting to\
  \ pick me up from the airport. \n\nI had no experience helping refugees, but I knew\
  \ what it\u2019s like to be a refugee. Thus, I embarked on the trip of my life to\
  \ help where I could. \n\nMytilene\u2019s small airport was packed with volunteers\
  \ like me. Some were with NGOs, but many were ordinary everyday people who came\
  \ there to help. \n\nI stopped to chat with a woman.\n\u201CHave you been here before?\u201D\
  \ I asked her nervously. \n\u201CIt\u2019s my third time this year,\u201D she said\
  \ casually while running towards a group of people.\nAt the car rental counter,\
  \ I asked the clerk for directions to Moria camp\nHe handed me a map of the island\
  \ marked with a red marker pointing to the camp. \n\u201CWell, many people are going\
  \ to the refugee camps, I made everybody\u2019s job easy by marking all of our maps,\u201D\
  \ he said smiling; perhaps he saw the surprised look on my face and answered my\
  \ question obvious from my expression. \nOn the coastal road for kilometers to come,\
  \ I passed wrecked rubber boats and hundreds of orange life jackets used by refugees\
  \ during their journey across the Aegean Sea. The scenery changed as I got closer\
  \ to the town center, the city sat in the bay with its harbor, and around it a boardwalk\
  \ with canteens and stores. The streets became too narrow for cars and home to furry\
  \ dogs who cruised on the sidewalks.  Already into the early afternoon, men and\
  \ women were rushing into cafes and restaurants in the spirally alleys. The air\
  \ smelled like sea, food, and cigarettes. \nFour miles later, the back roads led\
  \ me to Moria camp, located among hills scattered with olive trees.\n\nMoria was\
  \ packed with hundreds of tents and thousands of people.  \n\nI got approached by\
  \ a man wearing a UNHCR vest. \n\n\u201CArabic or Farsi?\u201D he asked me. \n\u201C\
  Farsi and English,\u201D I responded suspiciously. \n\u201CAre you looking for the\
  \ UNHCR office to get your papers?\u201D He asked. \n\u201COh no, I\u2019m here\
  \ to help. Just a volunteer and looking to see where I could go to register.\u201D\
  \ I said. \nHe finally smiled. \n\u201CYou can go and help with anything you want,\
  \ many can use your language skills. Not for UNHCR, we have our own certified translators,\
  \ but go down there, there\u2019s a kitchen and the clothing tent right there in\
  \ the middle,\u201D he pointed to the center of the camp. \n\nThe camp smelled like\
  \ burned plastic, woods, and things I didn\u2019t smell prior to that day. To keep\
  \ warm, men had been burning anything they could find to make a fire. I joined a\
  \ group of them. For the first time since I arrived in Lesbos that morning, I felt\
  \ relaxed and warm standing by the fire. Each seemed deep in their thoughts. We\
  \ didn\u2019t say much to one another. \n\nLater that week I joined a group of volunteers\
  \ at the beach. They waited on the beach spotting boats with binoculars, waving\
  \ thermal shiny blankets to guide the boats away from the rocks to a safe landing\
  \ spot on the beach. At night, they shined flashlights on the water, trying to guide\
  \ boats. \n\nAs boats approached, rescuers in wet suits wade into the water to pull\
  \ in the boats, shouting \u201Cslow, careful\u201D in Arabic and Farsi. \n\nAlmost\
  \ everyone coming of the boats were crying and shaking. \n\nIt was during that two\
  \ weeks that I got to witness the duality of what has historically been referred\
  \ to as \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019. Those refugees made one of the most\
  \ difficult decisions in their lives: to leave their homes in search of a safer\
  \ life. Yet, hundreds of people from across the world left the comfort of their\
  \ home to give their love to those fleeing the violence and conflicts enforced on\
  \ them. \n\nWe the people are capable of love and benevolence, yet we are also capable\
  \ of brutality, and war. It is this constant juxtaposition that makes the human\
  \ race so hard to understand \u2014 and yet so easy to love and to admire."
