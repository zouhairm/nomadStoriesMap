Text: "Before this trip I was (maybe on purpose) only going to countries were either\
  \ Spanish or English were the official language. So when a friend and I had to go\
  \ to Cape Town for work I knew I was jumping into something big. \nWhen we arrived\
  \ we had zero problem on the airport and on our way to the hotel. Our language problems\
  \ started the next morning though, when we went out to the train station and wanted\
  \ to go \"somewhere new\". Yes, we were not specific, we did little previous research\
  \ because we had just a couple days before our conference started, what could go\
  \ wrong for two woman with no internet in a country where they do not speak the\
  \ official language?. After using gestures and a map we ended up with tickets to\
  \ Simon's Town. It was a warm sunny day of African Winter and we were feeling good.\
  \ We were leaving the city, looking at big buildings when we started to feel the\
  \ see breeze and all of the sudden, after one curve, we were literally above the\
  \ sea. It was something so beautiful that we pulled our heads out of the window\
  \ and screamed into the wind. Small coloured beach-houses went by, beautiful old\
  \ train stations, great landscapes, and we even made some friends on the almost\
  \ 2 hours of journey, then we finally arrived to our destiny. Simon's Town is a\
  \ beach full of penguins!, we could not believe it, it was surreal. We had a great\
  \ time looking at this lovely and diverse creatures, we went to a museum, we had\
  \ a blast, until the sun started to go down (around 6 pm) and we noticed that the\
  \ electricity went off. The dream turned into a nightmare right away. \n\nThe train\
  \ couldn't work without electricity so we had to wait for a connection bus that\
  \ took us to another town and when we asked the name of it to the people around\
  \ us, none of them understood. Some women started to pray in Afrikaans, we started\
  \ to freak out internally. When we arrived to the train station everyone was speaking\
  \ loudly, the train was working but the lights of the city were also off. A young\
  \ man who worked there understood that we were looking for the train to Cape Town\
  \ and took us there. Then he only said the word \"Danger\" many times. My friend\
  \ and I were squeezing each other arms. We were next to the train's door analyzing\
  \ our options and a man started to yell at us \"Hey, You girls, hey, come here\"\
  .  We moved to the center and sit there. Another man asked us \"Where' you from?\"\
  \ and we said \"South America\". He frown and replied \"You' from the states\" and\
  \ we said \"No, no, Chile. Latinoamerica\". The man next to him said \"Where is\
  \ that?\" We replied \"Next to Argentina\", and a third man said \"Oh, so you are\
  \ mexican\" and we just looked at each other and nod, he said \"Oh...badass gangs\
  \ over there. Tough\" and we started to channel our inner-latina-getto selves, after\
  \ all, luckily we both are actresses and went to Africa invited to a playwright's\
  \ Conference for our work as writers and I could see that talent flying across the\
  \ place, oh boy what great stories we invented. We had all the people around us\
  \ entertained. We certainly are two streetwise women from a dangerous latinoamerican\
  \ city so we do have stories, but we were telling Breaking Bad level of stories\
  \ over there. We earned respect. We arrived to our destiny, and before the group\
  \ of people from our train crossed the door, one guard jumped into the crowd and\
  \ started to chase for no apparent reason a group of 3 guys that were previously\
  \ talking with us. We were shocked. We ran to the hotel and arrived tired and scared\
  \ as hell. The receptionist told us how dangerous was everything - specially train\
  \ stations - after dark, and that in Cape Town usually women don't go out walking\
  \ at night without large groups and they take cabs to move around. And that is how\
  \ you learn that you MUST do your research before traveling."
