Text: "As I stepped out from the airplane after taking a panoramic view of the mighty\
  \ snow capped mountains, I was welcomed with the cold fresh air. Srinagar is one\
  \ of the beautiful places in India even after the strict rules, thousands of visitors\
  \ visit the beautiful town of dal Lake and shikaras all time of the year. I did\
  \ not fall in love only because I love mountains or the vibe you get while rowing\
  \ a boat in dal Lake but I love that place because of the friendly locals. I remember\
  \ it had got late as we reached in the evening, we were asked to return back to\
  \ the hotel by 8, so I just took a stroll even when it was so cold and then I met\
  \ a stranger who told me about local markets, food I should try, places I should\
  \ not miss and he offered me Kanger ( is a pot filled with red charcoals ) so I\
  \ can stay warm. We talked for an hour and he dropped me back and it was all safe.\
  \ The second incident was at night it was 1am and we were inside the hotel, me and\
  \ my cousins were getting bored so we went to  the garden of the hotel and started\
  \ playing and soon the helpers of the hotel joined us for some fun. Everything seemed\
  \ so beautiful about how locals treated us like their own, even the owner of the\
  \ house boat made Kawa tea for us, got food even when it was mentioned while booking.\
  \ \n\nI feel you fall in love with a place not just because of the landscape or\
  \ the place you go but you fall in love with because you meet such kind of people\
  \ those who make you feel at home even when you are stranger to them. Srinagar,\
  \ even when it's under the attack and cerfue always, the people there well they\
  \ are different, they are calm, happy and if you let them row there boats, let them\
  \ sell their business and let them live peacefully then there is no better place\
  \ to feel the hospitality from a local."
