Text: "For a long time I thought about how I would tell my experience in Egypt and\
  \ how I could express everything I felt when I first met Cairo.\n\nThe choice of\
  \ words is always difficult because everything I can say will always be small, limited\
  \ and even unfair in relation to historical greatness; the artistic immensity and\
  \ the natural and human beauty that I found in the country of the Pharaohs.\n\n\
  The sum of all the feelings, all the smells and all the recorded images compels\
  \ me to perpetuate my memories, as a way of honoring the place where I spent some\
  \ of the best days of my life.\n\nAnd with the title \"The Color of Cairo\", I begin\
  \ to tell you about the days I lived and about what was added to my being from then\
  \ on.\n\nWhen I decided to go to Egypt it was as if I were finally fulfilling one\
  \ of my impossible dreams of adolescence. This sense of conquest \n'burned' my traveling\
  \ soul in a way that reminded me of the excitement of that era.\n\nFor me, going\
  \ to Egypt was not just visiting a new destination, or stamping another country\
  \ in the passport. It was not only the historical wonders and the size of the pyramids.\
  \ Going to the Land of the Pharaohs, for me, was like climbing a new stage in the\
  \ journey of my travel life .\n\nFinally I would meet a country in Africa - the\
  \ main cradle of humanity. I would see Egypt - the land of the Pharaohs !!!!! All\
  \ this was within my reach and I could not let go.\n\nThe arrival in Cairo was exciting.\n\
  \nThe first glimpse of the pyramids in the aircraft window already announced that\
  \ the whole dream was coming to fruition.\n\nThe color of the desert mingled with\
  \ the color of Giza and its pyramids, and then the color of the buildings and houses\
  \ and their dusty gardens. Everything was in the same tone. Only the dark color\
  \ of the Nile River cut the pinkish gray that was so characteristic of Cairo.\n\
  I couldn1t imagine that the color of Cairo would never come out of my memory.\n\n\
  The expectation of leaving the airport and looking at the legendary Egyptian capital\
  \ was immense.\n\nIt was impossible not to admire the color of Cairo's buildings.\n\
  \nOf a rosy gray color, the buildings along our way visually integrated a unique\
  \ set of homes and offices. The colors of the city vary little. Cairo is a city\
  \ of unique color that, seen from far, match to the surrounding desert sands.\n\n\
  Unusual, too, is the variety of exterior finishes of apartments and fa\xE7ades of\
  \ buildings. Types, shapes and colors of different windows on the same fa\xE7ade.\n\
  \nThe balconies decorated in different colors and protection. Many were insulated\
  \ by curtains or colorful hanging carpets.\n\nThe color of Cairo is unique, exotic\
  \ and warm.\n\nI saw people in their daily or religious outfits walking through\
  \ the streets and sidewalks amid shabby camels, and this made me more and more enthusiastic\
  \ about all of that.\n\nAs I walked through the city of a thousand minarets - Cairo,\
  \ I felt myself penetrating the mysterious Arab world and its unique characteristics.\n\
  \nThe curiosity to understand all about it increased at each step.\n\nThousands\
  \ of years have passed since the Pharaohs were on Earth, and my days on their land\
  \ were just beginning."
