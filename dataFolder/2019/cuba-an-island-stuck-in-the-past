Text: "As I sit here, in the midst of week three in -25 degree Celsius temperatures,\
  \ I am reflecting on a warmer time and place! The summer of 2001, I landed in Cuba\
  \ and was about to enter a world I never knew existed. Little did I know this island\
  \ would be like no other I had visited before. There was a lot of commotion at the\
  \ airport--so many people wanting to help you with your bags for a fee. After the\
  \ flight I had to visit the restroom--it was to my surprise that I had to pay for\
  \ toilet paper! I have travelled in the past, but never encountered this, I felt\
  \ like I was in a strange new world. Next, my friends from work and I that had travelled\
  \ together loaded the bus to start our journey to the hotel. During our arrival\
  \ and ride to the resort I noticed that I did not see any 'Golden Arches',  KFCs\
  \ or chain retail stores. At that time, I did not know that was a clear sign of\
  \ the island being under communist rule. Upon arriving at our hotel and checking\
  \ in we were ready to begin our adventure. \n\n\n  Our first morning in Cuba we\
  \ met with a tour guide to book an excursion--we chose a boat ride from Varadero\
  \ to Havana. We entered the Havana harbor and saw canons protecting the land--I\
  \ could feel the history surrounding me and knew this capital city had many stories\
  \ to share. We got off the boat and were greeted by a flock of people asking if\
  \ we had anything for them, such as toothpaste, or if we wanted to take their picture\
  \ for a fee. There were musicians and dancers that showed up and children dressed\
  \ in traditional outfits--all hoping to make a dollar or two. I learned that the\
  \ average Cuban made $12 US a month under Castro's communism, so any opportunity\
  \ to make extra money they must attempt. I met an English teacher working at the\
  \ resort--at least working there he was able to make tips on top of his $12 US a\
  \ month. This was the case for many people in Cuba--they are a highly educated population--as\
  \ education is free.\n\n\n  Cubans have lived on a rations system for many years\
  \ and are so appreciative of the little things we take for granted--like toilet\
  \ paper and toothpaste. They have lived their lives with the bare minimum of necessities\
  \ and their food rations for the month are known to only last for ten days out of\
  \ the month. So, I can understand why it is crucial to try to make any additional\
  \ money to purchase goods or food from the black market. \n\n\n  Travelling into\
  \ Havana is like taking a trip back in time. The streets are flooded with 1950s-1960s\
  \ vehicles. Cubans are skilled at using whatever they can to keep their cars running,\
  \ as they are unable to get any parts from American car dealerships. Communism and\
  \ the trade embargo with the US has created a strong, resilient and resourceful\
  \ people. When our day in Havana came to an end, we took a bus tour back to our\
  \ resort--stopping at many historical sites (including Revolution Plaza, Capital\
  \ Building and Cathedral Square) on the way. We enjoyed a very experienced and entertaining\
  \ tour guide on the bus. As I journeyed throughout Cuba, remnants of decades of\
  \ communism and the revolution are everywhere. You can not walk very far without\
  \ seeing a picture, painting or craft with Fidel Castro or the revolutionary Che\
  \ Guevara on it. \n\n\n  Living their lives under such extreme, deprived conditions\
  \ have forced thousands of Cubans to to attempt to escape their island for a fresh\
  \ start and a chance at freedom sixty miles north across the sea to Florida. Thousands\
  \ have died attempting to make that journey in shark-infested waters and under the\
  \ intense heat of the Caribbean sun. I look forward to returning to this beautiful\
  \ island someday and learning more about the people, their culture  and history.\
  \ I found that as I returned home from my time in Cuba, I had a renewed sense of\
  \ appreciation for all the abundance we enjoy in Canada."
