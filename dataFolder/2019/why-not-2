Text: "\u201CPack your bags and meet me in Tahiti in ten days?\u201D With adrenaline\
  \ coursing through my veins but trying to sound easy going and flirty, I typed back,\
  \ \u201CWhy not?\u201D\n\nAs soon as I hit send, reality hit. I had only ten days\
  \ to fly to Toronto, Canada, say goodbye to my family, fly to Fort Lauderdale, Florida,\
  \ complete a five day Seafarers training course, fly back to my home in Costa Rica,\
  \ pack up the last five years of my life, then finally fly half way around the world\
  \ to Tahiti. My entire body went numb. \n\nWhen Dave and I had parted ways after\
  \ our brief twenty four hour romance in Costa Rica, I thought I would never hear\
  \ from him again. And, when I stepped off the plane in Tahiti, I was honestly worried\
  \ that I wouldn\u2019t recognise him. As I watched a relative stranger walk towards\
  \ me ready to whisk me off to my new home, my entire body went numb for the second\
  \ time in ten days.  \n\nDriving from the airport to the marina was a complete blur\
  \ of small talk, palms trees and French signs I couldn\u2019t read. \u201CWhat the\
  \ hell had I just done?\u201D  \n\n\u201CThis is OUR cabin\u201D he says. Just like\
  \ that, my question was answered. I had just signed up to sail across the Pacific\
  \ in a tiny shared cabin with a man I barely knew. I politely excused myself and\
  \ went and threw up into our toilet, which, coincidentally doubled as our shower.\
  \ \n\nWe were scheduled to cruise around various Islands in the South Pacific, including\
  \ Bora Bora and Moorea for two weeks with the owner of the yacht and his family.\
  \ While most people spend their honeymoons or anniversaries on their visits to the\
  \ turquoise waters of French Polynesia, Dave and I spent our time in those clear\
  \ waters getting to know each other. We surfed secret spots that were only accessible\
  \ by boat with the locals, free dived with gentle giants, the manta rays, and the\
  \ not so gentle lemon sharks. \n\nOn our last island adventure we cruised up to\
  \ the little known island of Huahine. I felt a massive wave of emotion surge through\
  \ me as tears began to trickle down my face. I couldn\u2019t explain it. I instantly\
  \ felt like the Universe had lead me through this crazy adventure to bring me home.\
  \ All the drama, all the uncertainties, all the questions, gone. Throughout the\
  \ previous two weeks I had felt a deep connection with the people of Polynesia.\
  \ We had all abandoned our previous lives to sail though uncharted waters, clinging\
  \ to the hope that by surrendering to the unknown we would eventually find our place\
  \ in the world. And now I felt an intangible connection to their land. \n\nOn our\
  \ last night in French Polynesia, David surprised me with a gorgeous strand of Tahitian\
  \ black pearls. As he placed the pearls around my neck, it hit me. If an oyster\
  \ could take a tiny grain of sand and turn it into something so beautiful and vastly\
  \ different from what it had originally been, what was stopping me from taking my\
  \ life in the same direction? To grow and change beyond recognition.\n\nOne of my\
  \ favourite quotes in life is \u201CYou can\u2019t stop the waves from coming, but\
  \ you can learn to surf\u201D. Looking back, it was only having survived the voyage\
  \ that I now have the strength to ride the waves. I sit here telling my story with\
  \ the coordinates of Huahine etched into the back of my wedding ring, just like\
  \ the memories of our travels will forever be etched in my heart."
