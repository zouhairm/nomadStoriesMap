Text: "\"Travel is name of experiences and the more you pass through experiences the\
  \ more you explore the nature\"\nWith some bad things good things are also around\
  \ us but to be happy positive things become peaceful. \n  \"Remember that happiness\
  \ is a way of \n  travel not a destination.\"( ROY M.Goodman)\nI travelled many\
  \ times with my parents out of city and when I travels my mind and soul \nbecome\
  \ so peaceful.One of my marvellous visited place is Islamabad-Pakistan. When I travelled\
  \  in Islamabd on my summer vacations , we went to \"Saidpur village\".\nIn Saidpur\
  \ there are amazing restaurants.\nI was with my sister and suddenly on my way to\
  \ work we saw a foreigner women. When we saw her we got wonder because we saw a\
  \ foreigner first time .Now at that time, there was curiosity inside us . At time\
  \ time, questions begun to arose in our mind that from which country she belongs\
  \ and I want to talk from this foreigner and a men from Pakistan was also with her.\
  \ So ,she was sitting in a restaurant and we were waiting when she will stand and\
  \ go out because in front of other people we can't communicate her becauce sometime\
  \ people don't think and began to laugh in such moment. We waited her maximum for\
  \ 10-14mins . Finally when she came out we surrounded her and begun to communicate\
  \ with her. We asked her that from which country she belong and she said, I'm from\
  \ Switzerland\".\nAfter it our parents can't talk to her in english and she was\
  \ obviously English Speaker . Our parents asked to Pakistani men which was Urdu\
  \ speaker that\" what she is doing here ? Is she is here in case of bussiness? \
  \ \nBut my parent asked in urdu from Urdu speaker .\nHe translated her in English\
  \ and then She said\" Yeah, I'm her in case of business .She further said after\
  \ seeing my younger brother that If he completed his eduacation then he can avail\
  \ employment in switzerland.Because switzerland offer many work visa for foreignerns.\n\
  After that ,we take selfie with her and she moved on her way and we also moved by\
  \ saying\n     \"Good-Bye\"\n\nOne experienced which I got was her self-esteem .\
  \ She communicated us in such a pleasent way that her picture is still in front\
  \ of my eye . And when I remember my traveled to Islamabad I first rememberd her.\n\
  Due to her high self esteem and  good ethics. \nAfter that we went to monal .\"\
  \ Monal\" is other captivating small restaurant of Islamabad which is nearly 6-8\
  \ km away from\" Saidpur village\" and we passed our car from mountain and scenery\
  \ around is charmful. Sometime I think that when we travel the slow and soft tune\
  \ which produce between interaction of air and vehicles is very peaceful and sometime\
  \ I began to sleep due to this soft voice. But I think other person can also feel\
  \ this it is not only me. \nAs I says usually:,\n  \"  The most amazing sleep is\
  \ during travel\n     which is nearly about 10-15 mins but \n     sometime may vary\
  \ \"\n     \n   \" The peaceful moment of mind and soul \n      is interaction between\
  \ air and vehicle in \n      which I usually feel sleepy\" (Eesha-S)\n\nBy the way\
  \ after covering distance we reached at Monal and here was crowd of people .I also\
  \ saw that one couple was celebrating their anniversery. And musicians were also\
  \ around there .This scene was damn good. We also ate dinner and we dishes were\
  \ very tasty but when thing I like the most was tea. Tea was very tasteful and In\
  \ my experience take take at night with some sound of air become so much special\
  \ at airy  place when there is greenry around us. There smiles were on faces of\
  \ people of every age.People of every age were happy there and they were taking\
  \ pics from their camera. They were indulged in captivating sight with some touch\
  \ of faints lights and views of mountain around restaurant. They were not rembering\
  \ their sorrows of life from which every person suffer . But I want to say one thing\
  \ that they were happy there due to pleasent enviornment.\n \n  \"No one is happy\
  \ in life. But with some \n    travel we can become happy and can \n    change our\
  \ life\"\n   \n                                (Zoom around the world)\n       \
  \                                 Eesha -S"
