Text: "Monsoon season is the best among all to visit most of places in Maharashtra.\
  \ You can plan some instant weekend trips from Mumbai or Pune to the near by places.\n\
  \nHarihareshwar & Shrivardhan\nHarihareshwar and Shrivardhan are around  210 Kms.\
  \ from Mumbai and 190 Kms. from Pune. Harihareshwar is a small town located along\
  \ Konkan region in Raigarh district of Maharashtra.\n\nHarihareshwar\nHarihareshwar\
  \ is surrounded by three hills named Harihareshwar, Harshinachal and Pushpadri.\
  \ Towards the north of the town there is an ancient temple of Kalbhairav and Lord\
  \ Shiva. Temple is located near the Harihareshwar beach which makes this temple\u2019\
  s backdrop extremely scenic. Harihareshwar is at the southern end of the triple\
  \ Raigad beaches of Diveagar, Shrivardhan and Harihareshwar. Dighi at the northern\
  \ end is the base for the trip to the legendary sea fortress \u2013 Murud Janjira.\
  \ \n\nShrivardhan is a city in Raigarh district. Shrivardhan is famous for its beaches\
  \ and Shri Laxminarayan temple. It is also famous as the \u2018Town of the Peshwas\u2019\
  \ \u2013 the first Peshwa, Balaji Vishwanath hailed from here. Shrivardhan is blessed\
  \ with majestic black sand beache and clear sea. Situated on a peninsula, Shrivardhan\
  \ has several beaches which are unspoiled, clean and relatively less crowded.\n\n\
  Shrivardhan and Harihareshwar both are black sand beaches. There are few other beached\
  \ nearby as Diveagar beach and more. These all beaches are relatively clean and\
  \ less crowded beaches. If one want to explore nature and its real beauty then this\
  \ is the perfect gateway for them.\n\n\nThe distance between Harihareshwar and Shrivardhan\
  \ is around 20 Kms.\n\nHow to reach from Mumbai??\nThere are two routes.\n\nThe\
  \ road route: Mumbai ->Panvel -> Pen -> Wadkhal -> Nagothane ->Roha -> Mhasala ->\
  \  Harihareshwar . This route is shorter but not very scenic or happening in any\
  \ way. The Roha Murud road is 2 \u2013 laned but narrow with quite a substantial\
  \ part of it\u2019s stretch being patchy between Mhasala & Roha and Roha & Nagothane.\
  \ \nThe coastal route: Mumbai -> Panvel -> Pen -> Wadkhal -> Kashid (via Alibaug\
  \ Road) -> Murud -> Mhasala -> Harihareshwar. Though it is longer route but the\
  \ beach road via Kashid \u2013 Murud for it\u2019s scenic drive along the coastal\
  \ route makes it beautiful.\n\nYou can use your GPS to get the perfect directions\
  \ of the same.\n\nDirections from Mumbai to Harihareshwar\n\nPlaces to stay:\nThere\
  \ are many good accommodations available in form of home stays, resorts and some\
  \ budget hotels.\n\nIf staying in Harihareshwar we would recommend the Harihareshwar\
  \ beach resort (which is right at the beach and near the temple) or the MTDC resort.\n\
  \nIn Diveagar a better option would be to stay in Exotica beach resort in Diveagar,\
  \ an excellent property of MTDC maintained and run by a private owner or You can\
  \ prefer to dine at Exotica as the food and services are very good perhaps the best\
  \ you can find in the whole of triple beaches belt.\n\nAnd if you staying in Shrivardhan\
  \ we can recommend you Hotel Sea Coast Resort.\n\nThe place is quite  pocket friendly\
  \ and staff is very good. And best part is the beach is only 0.5 Km from this place.\
  \ You can enjoy the early morning nature along with beautiful sun rise.\n\nOther\
  \ accommodation options\n\nFood options\nIf you are non vegetarian there are lots\
  \ of sea food options available in whole area. For vegetarian ones there are quite\
  \ a few options. If you are a home food lover , various eatery options available."
