Text: "I was walking for almost one and half hour and it was difficult trek for me\
  \ anyway i was not cared about the hardness of the trek my mind was full about the\
  \ name i heard about the village . The name of the village was magical valley .\
  \ So i was rushing towards the bushes and slippery roads to reach der and after\
  \ some small struggles and anxiety i reached the top of a hill . From der the whole\
  \ view and everything just changed in a blink of eyes . And der was a tree leeping\
  \ down and i thought its just made for me , i sat there for a while and my eyes\
  \ were filled withe the beauty of magical valley and yes its really magic . Only\
  \ few small houses in this village and dey were shattered in different parts of\
  \ village  every house has its own beauty and i was looking the great blend of nature\
  \ through my eyes and i was getting higher after seeing those magical color that\
  \ sun is spreading across the hills and flowers of magical valley , suddenly i noticed\
  \ someone is waving hand across me , and he was far away from me and i also waved\
  \ him , den suddenly he just ran from the hill and was coming so fast towards me\
  \ and i was like what is happening did i did anything wrong , and he come beside\
  \ me and welcomed me to the greatest village i have ever seen and i started walking\
  \ with me and my usual companion my tent and sleeping bag also with me . He was\
  \ explaining about the village to me and saying only few people comes here . Everyone\
  \ comes to the other side of this mountain malana . And goes but only few people\
  \ comes to our village , he told me there is no electricity here . And i was not\
  \ in state of mind to think about charging my phon or anythg i was just lost in\
  \ the magical world .we walked for a while and then he inteoduced me to his brother\
  \ and his brother is running a guesthouse here so i asked can i hope in also for\
  \ few days and he was happpy and let me in and said u should pay for only food items\
  \ you eat . I said yes , and he said its because we have to go down to buy food\
  \ and all other things and its takes about 1 hour to go down and 2 hour to get up\
  \ . And den i walked out and find a best place to put my tent and  den i was walking\
  \ along the village and holding my drawing book with me and everytime i sit and\
  \ look in to the valley . Its like seeing different magical world and i was wondering\
  \ about the creation of nature . Because it was pure bliss . \nAnd den i started\
  \ noticing that the cold is getting higher so i went back to my tent and when i\
  \ reached there the guest house guy already put a campfire so i went and sat there\
  \ for a while and  i was enjoying the cold with some goood fire around me . And\
  \ we were talking about the village and he said from this village there is a famous\
  \ trek starts its nagarooni trek amd she said its the toppest peak of these mountains\
  \ and i was so eager to hear about this trek and then he was explaining me about\
  \ the routes to go there and inbetween have to go through a forest also and its\
  \ bit dangerous route to choose because in that forest they often sees blackleopard\
  \ and i was hearing all dese and sitting beside the fire because the cold was getting\
  \ higher . And den suddenly he made me some chai and we drank chai and then i went\
  \ back to my tent and opening my sleeping bag and i just layed there and it was\
  \ the best cold that himalayas could give me ever and i was already lost in the\
  \ magical valley and the stories of this village so i closed my eyes and i remembered\
  \ Someone ones said , \u201Cits all about thinking and feeling what you belive\u201D"
