Text: "Southern Exposure\n       A few years ago, I volunteered with an organization\
  \ called \u201CProject Overseas\u201D. I worked with local teachers in developing\
  \ communities sharing ideas about sustainable education. I was placed on the mysterious\
  \ volcanic island of Dominica, one of the least visited islands in the Caribbean.\n\
  \n      I have been trying to find the exact words to describe the beauty of this\
  \ island, humble and unassuming like the very extraordinary people that inhabit\
  \ it. With its hot natural soothing spring waters, countless cool fresh waterfalls,\
  \ and lush green forests, to the calm and collected iguanas, crimson perennials\
  \ sprouting from all directions, Dominica, in all its grandeur, left a distinct\
  \ image in my consciousness. Snorkelling in Champagne Bay with warm bubbles floating\
  \ up from the sea floor, to the untold pathways leading hiking lovers to Boiling\
  \ Lake, Dominica is by far the most undervalued island in the sparkling waters of\
  \ the Caribbean. \n\n        And so began my love affair with the islands of the\
  \ Caribbean. My next stop brought me to Barbados. Seeking out the best surf spots\
  \ in the world for virgin surfers like myself, I made my way to Surfer\u2019s Point,\
  \ home to Zed\u2019s Surf Adventures in Christ Church, Barbados. \n\n \tAs I passed\
  \ along the small roundabout roads, I saw the infamous grocery store, Mikes Mini\
  \ Mart. Not too far off in the distance were the blue signs indicating \u201CZed\u2019\
  s\u201D. I rented a small little beach cabin at sea level, a few steps from the\
  \ Caribbean Sea. With a hammock hanging on my porch, it was here that I lay many\
  \ nights listening to the sounds of the ocean. I wasn\u2019t alone for long though.\
  \ I spent my days surfing the calm crystal waters with turtles floating right along\
  \ with me. And how could I forget the Barbadian hospitality finding its way to my\
  \ hammock, only to be charmed by evening cook outs with Bajan locals and surfers?\
  \ \n\n\tAn unfinished Banks beer in hand, and a crumpled map torn from my guide\
  \ book in another, I meandered through the streets of Barbados, solo, as I often\
  \ am, only to find myself sidetracked by the hustle and bustle at Ostin Fish Market.\
  \ It\u2019s a cacophony of harmony and dissonance. Flying fish draped from the ceilings,\
  \ between the rancid and the fragrant.  Friends of friends, and vendors adorned\
  \ in their blue aprons, chattering about the day\u2019s catch, idle as always, as\
  \ if time is not against them.\n\n\tEn route back to my surf hostel, I can see the\
  \ bobbing of fishermen boats in the crystal waters, children and tourists soaking\
  \ up the sun, or someone\u2019s Bajan grandfather taking refuge under a small coloured\
  \ rooftop staring aimlessly, yet without a doubt, jauntily admiring their beloved\
  \ sea. In spite of his apparent lack, he lacks nothing. \n\n\tI retreat back to\
  \ my exclusive yet, modest hostel. A million-dollar view, watching self-assured\
  \ surfers coast along on their long boards, flipping and dancing, confronting the\
  \ face of each passing wave. No late-night rum induced parties. A simple trip that\
  \ ends with the moonlight\u2019s smile beaming bright into the crevices of my cabin\
  \ walls. \n\n\tIn my final stretch, I was led to Antigua, renowned for its 365 beaches,\
  \ a scuba diver\u2019s mecca, and a bit further than planned. This island brought\
  \ more beauty than I had expected. Most people think that all beaches look the same,\
  \ but every time I step into the sand, my senses reveal how even the sand has its\
  \ own unique DNA. White, light brown, dark brown, partially pebbled sand, these\
  \ are only a few features that make each island more distinct than the other. A\
  \ trip to Antigua wouldn\u2019t be complete without a ride on a catamaran. Galley\
  \ or Half Moon Bay, a honeymooner\u2019s paradise, not what I was hoping for, but\
  \ the perfect space for my own headspace. \n\n       It was only a matter of time\
  \ that this Canadian girl\u2019s escape from northern snow-capped mountains and\
  \ icy tundra, would come to a bitter end. Yet, every end, is the start of a new\
  \ beginning. The Caribbean, with its uncanny ways, still has a way of gently setting\
  \ my sail back south towards its way.\n\nBy Adelina Fabiano (Calgary, Canada)\n\
