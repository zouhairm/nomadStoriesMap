Text: "I remember Mostar.\nHer cobbled old town streets. The Islamic Minarets of her\
  \ Eastern Bank, the Orthodox Churches of her West. \n\nHer locality of conflict,\
  \ rejuvenation and personal histories.\n\n***\nMiran is Bosnian. He is 35 and Muslim.\
  \ Miran lived through the Balkans war; playing in the Hum Hills as a child, fighting\
  \ there as a young man. His story begins on Santiceva Ulica, the frontline between\
  \ Croats and Bosniaks. (Bosnian Muslims).\n\n     'This is the street. On that side\
  \ were 4000 Croat troops. Here only Mostar citizens. We were 1200. \n     My Grandfather\
  \ fought here. My Grandfather died here.\n     Killed by a sniper in that building.'\n\
  \nThe distance between opposing lines is 20 feet. Buildings wear bullet-hole vests,\
  \ shelled suits and political graffiti. At ground level doorways are frameless,\
  \ yet above I see UPVC windows and makeshift curtains. Bosniaks have returned to\
  \ live here. The upper windows forming a rotten jawline, a few hardy teeth standing\
  \ firm amid decay.\n\nMiran's scars are equally raw as he speaks of modern Mostar.\n\
  \n     'This Graffiti, you see here? \n     WMC. \n     This graffiti divides the\
  \ city. \n     West Mostar City. There is no such thing. \n     There is only one\
  \ Mostar City.'\n\nMiran strokes the skeletal steel of the building where his Grandfather\
  \ died. Cement falls loose. He uses this to strike a line through 'W.'\n\n     \u2018\
  Mostar City. Only one Mostar City.'\n\n***\nMiran continues;\n\n     \u2018We are\
  \ stood on the Croat battle line, but this was a war on two fronts. \n     Now to\
  \ the mountains. Now to the Serbian frontline.'\n\nAs we drive, graveyards line\
  \ the road and unweathered memorials mark Mostar\u2019s recent loss. An elderly\
  \ gentleman flags down our vehicle. Miran opens the door;\n\n     'He is the father\
  \ of my wife. He wants to see the frontline. He wants to remember.\u2019\n\nRabbit\
  \ tracks stain the steep ascents above Mostar where citizens walked daily to fight.\
  \ The hilltop is fortified with stone walls and bunkers; remnants from Austro-Hungarian\
  \ conflict, adopted by German troops during WWII, later by Mostar citizens themselves.\
  \ \n\nMiran points to a ruined hamlet discarded amongst the barren landscape;\n\n\
  \     'In this village 22 bodies were found 3 weeks ago! \n     When the Serbians\
  \ attacked, they took the villagers. \n     No-one knew their fate. \n     Until\
  \ now.'\n\nWe pass a small copse in no-man\u2019s-land. The elderly gent's demeanour\
  \ darkens;\nOur guide translates;\n\n     'There is a memorial in this wood. \n\
  \     My friends died here. My brother too.\n     My name should lie with theirs.'\n\
  \nThese local narratives connect me to Mostar\u2019s landscape and history, offering\
  \ one side of a complex cultural conflict. A storm cloud looms above me. It seems\
  \ poignant.\n\nA Cross rises 33 metres above the Hum Hills casting shadow upon Mostar.\
  \ It serves for pilgrimage, a memorial to Croat Orthodox Christians lost during\
  \ warfare. For some it represents a difficult reminder of 9th November 1993 when\
  \ Croatian troops destroyed the Stari Most Bridge.\n \nThis is regarded as the most\
  \ discordant act during Mostar\u2019s history. The destruction of the Bridge separated\
  \ citizens from their remaining fresh water source; deprived the region of beautiful\
  \ architectural heritage and divided Mostar\u2019s Eastern and Western cultures\
  \ literally and symbolically.\n\nThe Stari Most Bridge, restored with UNESCO funding\
  \ in 2004, now draws my eyes. A pale, petrified moon arching River Neretva\u2019\
  s glimmering aquamarine waters. The bridge reconnects the heart of Mostar, uniting\
  \ disparate cultures and religions and drawing tourists to learn Mostar\u2019s history.\n\
  \n***\n\nOn the hills above Mostar wild herbs grow in patches around the military\
  \ bunkers. The elderly gent stoops to pick a handful; \n\n     'For tea.' He says\
  \ in broken English. 'For tea.\u2019 'It helps.'\n\nI note his bowed left leg, his\
  \ withered hand. Miran explains;\n\n     'It helps heal their wounds. \n     Many\
  \ soldiers return for herbs. \n     They add water to make tea; Serbian and Croat\
  \ fighters too.'\n\nThe elderly gent shows me a handful of bent, warped metal; fragments\
  \ of shrapnel picked from the hillside.\n\n     'We must not forget'\n\nIn my own\
  \ hand I clutch lemon thyme and sage leaves. Anti-oxidants, regenerating, rejuvenating.\
  \ \n\nI see more herbs interspersed with wild daisies, Alpine thistles, and small\
  \ red flowers growing from barren earth. \nMy eyes linger on the poppies growing\
  \ from soils of conflict. Mostar;\n\n     Graffiti to forget, Bridges to connect.\n\
  \     Herbs to heal, Poppies to remember."
