Text: "In late 2018, I traveled to Ecuador for a 12-day plant medicine retreat in\
  \ the Andes mountains. I went by myself, leaving my fianc\xE9e and job behind, and\
  \ traveling out of the country by myself for the first time in my life. I wanted\
  \ to challenge myself and put myself in a situation where I had no one close that\
  \ I could fall back on during some trying situations. The retreat consisted of two\
  \ Ayahuasca ceremonies, two San Pedro ceremonies, and one Sweat Lodge ceremony,\
  \ AKA a temazcal. During the retreat, I shared a room and bunk bed on the ceremony\
  \ grounds where another 30 or so other worldwide travelers were staying for the\
  \ retreat. We had a daily schedule that was laid out for the 12 days, with the goal\
  \ being to go deeper into mind and get realigned with your true self and life purpose.\
  \ We had all kinds of people from all over the world there for all different reasons.\
  \ Besides the plant ceremonies, we had daily workshops and group sharing meetings.\
  \ it was very much a group psychotherapy retreat combined with plant psychedelics.\
  \ As the days went on, we all become closer to each other, offering emotional support,\
  \ and opening ourselves up to each other. We cried together, laughed together, got\
  \ scared together, and grew together. By the end of the 12 days, we had all become\
  \ best friends. The lessons we all learned are forever etched into our minds, and\
  \ the stories we had will never be erased. The hardest part of the retreat was leaving,\
  \ as it genuinely felt like I was leaving best friends that I have known for years.\
  \ The amount we grew together in less than two weeks amounted to a childhood together.\
  \ What made my story so impactful in retrospect was my journaling. I journaled daily\
  \ during my retreat for the sole purpose of remembering my experience and lessons.\
  \ But when the retreat was over, I realized that I had a passion for writing and\
  \ had written a 55K+ word story. Part of my self-discovery of the trip was discovering\
  \ (or rediscovering) my love of writing. Upon returning home, I quit my mundane\
  \ desk job and convinced my fianc\xE9e to do the same. We booked a trip to Thailand\
  \ and will now be traveling for a month to continue self-discovery and my writing\
  \ journey. Have you ever wanted to just quit your day job and find out who you really\
  \ are? Well, that is the story I have been putting together. A leap into the unknown."
