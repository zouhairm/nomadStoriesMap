Text: "The desire to travel peaks when summer rolls around. Breezy. Carefree. Warm.\
  \ In a world where moments of time in reality are often far from ideal, we all crave\
  \ for the possibility of escape, a different sense of being and a form of existence\
  \ beyond the realm of time. For many avid travelers, the words \u201Csummer vacation\u201D\
  \ mean a fun getaway with friends and family, an all-inclusive resort in Cabos or\
  \ Punta Cana, or an opportunity to post beautiful snapshots of the world on Instagram.\
  \ \n\nI used to be one of these travelers. Checking in on my favorite travel Instagram\
  \ bloggers has become a daily routine. I fantasized myself strolling on the sun-baked\
  \ streets of Spain, being surrounded by the electric-blue turf, sub-100-degree weather\
  \ and Spanish boys. However, I found myself losing the meaning of travel as the\
  \ routine became an emotionless, robotic pattern. Can a vacation mean more than\
  \ just some glamorous Instagram pictures? Is there a place where I can find a part\
  \ of my identity and fulfill a deeper understanding of the world? What can make\
  \ a vacation ever-lasting and meaningful?\n\nHoping to answer these questions, I\
  \ decided to travel to Hubei, China for two weeks. Unlike the top destinations in\
  \ China, such as Beijing and Shanghai, Hubei is nowhere near a metropolitan city\
  \ and a tourist hotspot. Located in the Central China region, Hubei is a land of\
  \ unfamiliar unknown. But to my dad, it is his hometown, where he celebrated love,\
  \ learned to grow, and shared joy and sorrows. \n\nAfter landing, the first thing\
  \ we did was visiting the house he lived in as a kid. I was shocked. It was small,\
  \ shabby, and hideous. \u201CVery ugly? This is not the worst. I had to pick herbs\
  \ from the forests nearby, harvest potatoes and vegetables for dinner, and walk\
  \ miles to school,\u201D my dad murmured when he noticed my disbelief. \n\nCarefully,\
  \ I pulled my father\u2019s vintage Kodak pictures from the dusty shoebox under\
  \ his bed. We lied on the bed together, going through the old photos one by one.\
  \ Although the pictures were not taken by an award-winning photographer or an Instagram\
  \ blogger, they represent my father\u2019s childhood. Each picture is like a kaleidoscope,\
  \ in which each surface is different, depending on the angle, the colors, and the\
  \ rotation. \n\nDrenched in sweat under the blistering sun, we then visited a nursing\
  \ home in Laohekou. Living in a barter economy, the residents were too poor to afford\
  \ air conditioning and had limited access to basic comforts like running water.\
  \ \u201CDo you guys have cell phones?\u201D I asked, exposing my ignorance. Wang\
  \ nainai (grandma) grabbed my hand, laughed, and said, \u201Cnot when a proper meal\
  \ is like an impossible luxury.\u201D Ironically, there is always a stigma about\
  \ Chinese people, especially Chinese international students, or so-called \u201C\
  FOBs\u201D, are \u201Cloaded\u201D and only wear high-end brands such as Balenciaga,\
  \ Gucci, or Helmut Lang. By sharing her anecdote with me, Wang nainai resurfaced\
  \ the unaccounted, dislocated, lost-in-the sea truth about the destitution in rural\
  \ provinces in China, embodying many lives of poverty untouched by China\u2019s\
  \ economic boom. \n\nWang nainai\u2019s words allowed me to dive into self-reflection\
  \ and cherish my life. In the book \u201CEat, Pray, Love\u201D by Elizabeth Gilbert,\
  \ she argues, \u201Cwe search for happiness everywhere, but we are like Tolstoy's\
  \ fabled beggar who spent his life sitting on a pot of gold, under him the whole\
  \ time. Your treasure - your perfection - is within you already. But to claim it,\
  \ you must leave the buy commotion of the mind and abandon the desires of the ego\
  \ and enter into the silence of the heart.\u201D This journey echoes to Gilbert\u2019\
  s claim by being by far my most vivid and profound self-realization. The trip to\
  \ Hubei is a timeless voyage, conquering time - the atemporal and limitless prison\
  \ of our universe - by successfully becoming a piece of me. We are trapped by the\
  \ scale of the universe, but in recognition of this truth comes a reckoning, that\
  \ travel can transcend time, space, and any formless medium. In this light, the\
  \ only rebellion that we can offer to retaliate against the relentlessness of time,\
  \ is meaningful travel."
