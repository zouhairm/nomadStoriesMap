Text: "As sweat dripped down my face, and thunder and lightning loomed over us, I\
  \ wondered what in the world had compelled me to take on the difficult hike between\
  \ Vernazza and Monterosso al Mare while I was on vacation. \n\nI didn\u2019t even\
  \ like hiking. \n\nPerhaps it was the idyllic photos of vibrant houses dangling\
  \ from the cliffs of Northern Italy, or the smell of the ocean air mixed with delicious\
  \ wines and fresh seafood. Either way, I ended up trekking up a trail which at points\
  \ felt like a ninety-degree angle, regretting all my decisions along the way. \n\
  \nI was travelling along with four other adventurers and practically strangers.\
  \ One had forgotten proper hiking shoes, another had rolled both of her ankles the\
  \ day before, and the two others were incredibly hungover. None of us were incredibly\
  \ energetic or well-prepared for this hike, but it was too late to turn around.\
  \ \n\nWe followed the trail, stopping frequently for the view of the vast ocean\
  \ before us, and gasps of breath (which were due both to the beautiful views and\
  \ our lacked of preparedness for such a challenging hike). After a while, it began\
  \ to feel as though this misadventure would never end. \n\nWe finally reached a\
  \ point where we began descending. Could this be it? Could we really have reached\
  \ the end? \n\nWe forced our feet to move one in front of the other until we arrived\
  \ at a set of stone steps. With a renewed energy we hopped down the steep stairs\
  \ until we could eventually see it, Monterosso al Mare. \n\nWe were not ready for\
  \ what we saw next\u2026 \n\nLemons. A copious amount of lemons. \n\nNot just your\
  \ average lemons, but an entire lemon festival. It was exactly the kind of festival\
  \ we did not know we needed! Without words, we all flocked to different booths.\
  \ Lemon cake, lemon custard, lemonade, lemoncello; if it could be made from lemon,\
  \ it was there! Almost naturally, we collected around the large fountain in the\
  \ town square, hands full of lemon goodies, and silently rejoiced for the tart treats\
  \ we stumbled upon. \n\nIn that moment, I forgot about my aching feet and switched\
  \ my thoughts to a conversation with a fellow traveller in the hostel the night\
  \ before. He was in his mid-sixties and travelling solo. The many twenty-somethings\
  \ in the hostel wanted to hear his story, myself included. He shared with us that\
  \ hiking Cinque Terre had been on his bucket list since he was in his twenties.\
  \ He was always caught up with work and obligations, and never made the time. He\
  \ realized that if not now, it would never happen. So, with two false knees, and\
  \ a bad back, he took his time with one trail between the villages each day, until\
  \ he had finally hiked between all five villages. \nI will never forget the look\
  \ on that man\u2019s face, as he shared with us his lifelong dream. It was a moment\
  \ in his life I was proud to be a brief part of. His story made me realize how lucky\
  \ I was to be sitting with a group of wonderful strangers in a lovely coastal Italy\
  \ village, stuffing our faces with lemons, and laughing over the fact that we thought\
  \ such a challenging hike would have been seamless. \n\nI learnt two incredibly\
  \ important things that weekend. One being that life is far too short, and this\
  \ world is far too vast and far too beautiful, for one to settle with seeing just\
  \ a few pieces of it. \n\nSecond. \n\n When life gives you lemons, make it into\
  \ a festival."
