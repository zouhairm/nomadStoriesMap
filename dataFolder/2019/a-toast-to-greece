Text: "A Toast to Greece, by Robbie Adams \n\nNestled comfortably in a craggy mountain\
  \ range in northern Greece just across the boarder from Macedonia sits the beautifully\
  \ preserved town of Perama.  It is famous for it\u2019s cave but I have not come\
  \ all of the way to northern Greece to see that.  No, I am here as a volunteer at\
  \ a refugee camp in the neighboring town of Katsikas, and I have just had a very\
  \ long day.  \n\nThe day began in abandoned hanger that served as the meeting place\
  \ for volunteers as well as the ad hoc shop for refugees to pick up donated supplies.\
  \  I was late for the daily check-in meeting but was filled in on what I missed\
  \ by the person who was unofficially in charge of the camp, a volunteer named Bernard.\
  \  The official entity overseeing the camp was the Greek military but their presence\
  \ felt more like a shadow along the perimeter than an actual protective force. \n\
  \nIt was an extremely hot day.  Out of the 900 refugees in the camp from Syria,\
  \ Iraq and Afghanistan, the majority of the refugees were Muslim and it was Ramadan.\
  \  Modestly dressed women wearing headscarves struck me as the most uncomfortable\
  \ in this setting.  No part of their body had relief from the heat and yet they\
  \ had to fast until sundown, including abstaining from water.  Not helping the situation\
  \ was the fact that the ground was aligned with tiny, loose rocks that puffed up\
  \ wisps of dust every time someone inadvertently kicked them.  The air was full\
  \ of the fine powder that clung to all clothing and caused a lot of respiratory\
  \ issues.  \n\nDusty, hot, hungry people living in tents were getting assistance\
  \ from a group of European and American volunteers with no real oversight from any\
  \ higher authority.  We were just there because no one else was.  We just helped\
  \ because the country of Greece already suffered austerity measures that had stretched\
  \ their resources too thin and yet they were taking thousands of refugees into their\
  \ country.  So the refugees were left with us; a group of well-intentioned individuals\
  \ within loosely arranged non-profits who were basically \u201Cwinging it\u201D\
  . \n\nAfter the first of many ten-hour days volunteering at the refugee camp, I\
  \ caught a series of buses back to Perama and went to my hotel.  After all of that,\
  \ I still got to go to a room of my own, have a hot shower and sleep in a bed. \
  \ Tired but hungry, I roamed the winding streets of the charming town until I happened\
  \ upon a restaurant perched high atop a hill. \u201CIs it too late to eat dinner?\u201D\
  \ I asked with some trace of desperation in my voice.\n\nA tall, slender woman with\
  \ stylish glasses answered with some surprised, \u201CToo late?  It is too early\
  \ for dinner but if you want to wait, we can serve you at nine.\u201D  She meant\
  \  nine pm.  Thrilled, I parked myself by a window overlooking a distant lake. \
  \ I sat with a glass of ros\xE9 lifted to the sky in a kind of salute to a country\
  \ willing to host me as well as many thousands of displaced persons.  It was the\
  \ first of many silent toasts I would give over the next several weeks as I sat\
  \ in the family-owned restaurant that became my home away from home and my respite\
  \ at the end of every difficult day at the camp.  The owners would tell me about\
  \ life in Greece, talked of the lack of opportunity for their two young daughters,\
  \ and lament the fact that their daughters would have to leave Greece to find work.\
  \  Given all of this, one might assume Greek people would be bitter towards any\
  \ outsiders who threatened to take even more away from them than they had already\
  \ lost.  However when I asked the couple who owned the restaurant about it, they\
  \ simply stated that they wished there was more they could do to help. \n\nThat\
  \ was the summer of 2016 and now I am back in the United States.  As we close our\
  \ boards and turn our backs to refugees, I still give a toast to Greece every evening."
