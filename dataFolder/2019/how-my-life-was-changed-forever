Text: "At 16, I was granted the chance to live in a small Costa Rican village and\
  \ attend school. I had very little experience with life in general. I was focusing\
  \ on the negative, and things kept going wrong. All of the insignificant comforts\
  \ I was used to in the United States were not so readily available in Costa Rica.\
  \ I isolated myself without giving much a chance in the beginning. It is one of\
  \ my deepest regrets. \n     Truthfully, I was so nervous and felt blocked by a\
  \ language barrier. However, a few incredible people shifted my attitude. They patiently\
  \ conversed with me, they invited me places when they could, and they said hello\
  \ to me when they passed. One classmate, Kerlin, and I really connected. I vowed\
  \ to come back and see her as soon as possible.\n      I began getting friend requests\
  \ from Costa Ricans. I accepted the vast majority of them, seizing the opportunity\
  \ to see their use of language on social media. At some point, I accepted a request\
  \ from Kevin. In December 2016, he messaged me. We soon began talking everyday and\
  \ continued talking for the next two years. It turned out he had lived near me and\
  \ went to the same school I had. When I finally discovered why Kevin didn't approach\
  \ me in the first place, he said it was because I had an aggressive face while I\
  \ was there. \n     I finally returned to Costa Rica in October 2018. I stayed at\
  \ Kerlin\u2019s house. We went swimming at waterfalls, ate delicious food, and relaxed.\
  \ Of course, though, you can probably guess what my most memorable experience was\
  \ that weekend. \n     Finally seeing Kevin\u2019s face in person, complete with\
  \ hazel eyes that are very similar to mine, felt surreal. In that moment, I couldn't\
  \ help but feel like we were just destined to be friends. I met his family and despite\
  \ my initial awkwardness, they welcomed me with nothing but love. I felt an overwhelming\
  \ connection to the entire family. I left longing to spend more time with them,\
  \ and began talking with Kevin and especially his mom everyday. \n     Within days\
  \ of returning in October 2018, I booked a trip to spend a few days of Kevin\u2019\
  s Christmas vacation there. I bought a few Christmas presents for the family, including\
  \ a Playstation 3 that for the adorable nine year old brother and band tees for\
  \ Kevin that he would never find there. Carrying my heavy bag from Denver to Costa\
  \ Rica was worth every bit of their happiness. \n     I was nothing but a part of\
  \ the family for those six days. His mom braided and straightened my wild hair to\
  \ tame it in the humidity. She boiled water for me so I didn't have to bathe in\
  \ cold water that I wasn't accustomed to. She made me french fries and bean empanadas\
  \ in place of the meat dishes her family was eating. I watched the kids play Playstation\
  \ and looked at Kevin\u2019s baby pictures. I even rode scary rides at the amusement\
  \ park.  \n     I had originally planned to spend only a day or two with them. However,\
  \ on the night before I was to depart, tears filled my eyes at the thought of leaving.\
  \ I ended up spending all of my available time, up to my last full day, there. There\
  \ was just a certain air of love and happiness within Costa Rican families that\
  \ isn't the same with many families in the United States. All of the family lives\
  \ in close proximity and they see one another everyday. They help each other out\
  \ and gladly mind whatever children wandered over to their house that day. \n  \
  \   When I look back on my life so far, it has been unconventional. I have not followed\
  \ in the footsteps of those in my hometown. When I break it all down, I think I\
  \ am the luckiest. I have been granted with the best lifelong gift I could ever\
  \ ask for. I have an entire bonus family of people who love me like their own in\
  \ Costa Rica. I didn't expect to be met with such love and affection during a weekend\
  \ trip, but it changed my life vastly."
