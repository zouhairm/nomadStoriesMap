Text: "It\u2019s 11 P.M, my first night in Bhutan, after 11 hours of Bus ride from\
  \ India, 2 bottles of beer have relaxed me to catch up with local folks by the bonfire.\
  \ The drawbacks of using romanticism to portray Bhutan, Gross National Happiness\
  \ Bhutan happiness Indicator,  Buddha and his philosophy, best use cases for conversation\
  \ is after you are a bit tipsy. \n\nWith heavy-eyes, I accomplish the endeavor to\
  \ reach hotel chasling, hidden amongst the glimmering lights of perfectly marketed\
  \ hotels near Clock Tower, Thimpu, this cheap arrangement offers hot water, a bed\
  \ & a quilt, just about everything you need in freezing temperatures. Not to forget,\
  \ an Analog TV with Indian soap opera, the weight of this tiny devil can give any\
  \ OLED a run for its money.  \nMuch to my dismay, the main gate of the hotel is\
  \ locked. Requesting the passer-by to call on the only number on the signboard,\
  \ I am starting to get worried. After 1 hour of uphill battle, I think I\u2019ll\
  \ go back to the bar & ask for help, the only person I know in this country, The\
  \ Bar Man.\n\nMojo Park, is the most popular bar in Thimpu, amongst other places,\
  \ this is where you will find most modern people in the city, soaring like a hawk.\
  \ Oh come on, I can\u2019t sleep here? It\u2019s 12:00 AM please help! I have only\
  \ 300 NU, any cheap lodges nearby? Shall I go to a karaoke club make friends, The\
  \ blonde I saw at the bar, what's her name or be brave/stupid & sleep in the alley?\
  \ There must be homeless in Bhutan. Thoughts induced my brain, with not much clarity,\
  \ childhood trauma of being precarious started to creep in. \nAt the Bar, is the\
  \ lead guitarist of the Band O' Strangers, the first Bhutanese Band to play gig's\
  \ in Thailand, playing all night singles of Dylan and Lennon, collecting his wages\
  \ Jimmy laughs \"You are In a messed situation, you should have informed the hotel\"\
  . Come on! it\u2019s a hotel, not a homestay! I have keys to my room.\n\"Bhutan\
  \ is racing towards being modern yet is a conservative & reserved country\". I asked\
  \ him can you come with me to the hotel Jimmy?\n\nRacing towards the hotel with\
  \ the confidence of having a local chap, we shout \u201CAajeo\u201D \u201CAajey\"\
  , I am getting free Dzongkha lessons, 30 minutes pass by, not a single sound from\
  \ inside, Thoughts induced my already aching head, What's going to happen? My stuff,\
  \ gadgets, money? How will I make it through the night? Shall I ask Jimmy to take\
  \ me home? Umm\u2026No. Not a good idea Nik. \nWhat are you going to do now? Jimmy\
  \ asks me, shrugging my shoulders, probably sleep in the alley? \n\nI plead Jimmy\
  \ to take me to his place, I\u2019ll sleep on the floor at your home. Taken aback,\
  \ reluctantlyJimmy agreed, on his Motor Bike, we go towards the outskirts of this\
  \ tiny city. Excited yet scared I wonder how many tourists have the pleasure to\
  \ experience what I am experiencing? Living like a local with a local.\nJimmy graciously\
  \ emptied his room and asked me to sleep there, filled with musical instruments,\
  \ Marley's poster and Lennon's people for peace, I rather sleep in the living area\
  \ outside Jimmy, it's your room. After much argument, both ended up fixing a temporary\
  \ bed outside.  \nOver a serving of warm rice, Azay the chili sauce made of dry\
  \ chili flakes with cheese & frozen clarified butter, says Jimmy, Nik had u been\
  \ crazy to sleep outside, you\u2019d be a \"frozen chicken\",  Hahaha, much graciously\
  \ I thanked him. Don\u2019t thank me, thank yourselves, it\u2019s your Karma. Think\
  \ and always stay positive.\nI peacefully depart into a deep sleep, thanking & living\
  \ in my new home with my new friend. Waking up to amid cordial chatters, I am served\
  \ Po Cha, the famous salty Butter tea and Khabzey homemade biscuits. Jimmy introduced\
  \ me to his family, conversations inclined towards how the modern micro-culture\
  \ has dramatically grasped Bhutan's culture, yet how core values and principles\
  \ remain strong. The Buddha's value of helping each other is very much evident in\
  \ how the people of last Shangri La still lead their lives daily."
