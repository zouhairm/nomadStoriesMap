Text: "My history starts four years ago, I live in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 2016\
  \ I met a Belgian friend, her name is Julie.  We met in a classe of photography,\
  \ Julie and I were models for a group of begginer photographers.  We talked a little\
  \ and then I added her on Facebook, just that, we did not talk anymore. Our lives\
  \ continued and in 2018 I decided to make a travel to France, to learn one new language.\
  \ I had never traveled to Europe, then I talked with some Brazilian friends, who\
  \ have traveled there, about cities with the better cost of living to learn French.\
  \ \nI also spoke to the mother of one of the children in the school where I worked\
  \ last year. I am currently a teacher student and have worked for two years at a\
  \ kindergarten. This mother is French and she pointed me to the city of Lyon to\
  \ learn the language. I started looking for this city and, as a good internet's\
  \ searcher, I found a group in Facebook about Internaciontal Students of Lyon. I\
  \ was surprised to see that Julie was in the group. So I sent her a message to ask\
  \ about the city.\nJulie was very kind, by coincidence she had moved to Lyon. She\
  \ offered lodging for me, but I confess that I was scared, because I did not know\
  \ her properly. So I decided not to accept the invitation, but I'd like to see her\
  \ again. Then, when I arrived in France I sent her a new message and Julie invited\
  \ me for a classe of  French conversation at her work. \nIt was this way that I\
  \ found a magical place. Julie works in a NGO that helps refugee people, it's incredible.\
  \ In this institution, people receive French conversation classes, but also, piano,\
  \ capoeira, computer science and many other options to reintegrate into society.\
  \ I met people all over the world: Senegal, Sudan, Venezuela, Syria. \nI had the\
  \ experience of knowing incredible stories of life, of overcoming and of hope. I\
  \ met people who really want to help create a better world. French people who give\
  \ their time to love others. I didn't expect to find so many friends, so many different\
  \ cultures and so many happiness in one only country. Now I want to travel more,\
  \ to others places and to found awesome people to share different experiences. Our\
  \ life is so short to live only in one place, I want to experience the thousands\
  \ of possibilities of inhabiting the world."
