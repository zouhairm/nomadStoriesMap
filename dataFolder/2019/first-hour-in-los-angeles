Text: '"I got off he plane at LAX with a dream in my cardigane" i wish my stay in
  Los Angeles was as cool as Miley song. However as soon as taxi stopped at the traffic
  light in Downtown and a crowd of black homeless people statred to follow the car
  like it was a Zombi appocalipses, I cursed everything WHAT AM I DOING HERE??? I''m
  just an ordinary girl from a small town in Siberia with a journalism diploma and
  a dream which has northing incommon with my BA. After i got it two month ago i decieded
  that i wanna fly to California and... and... see what will happen. Hollywood, ocean,
  palm trees and beautiful sunsets... And what i got instead? Gangsters stalking the
  car? Will i die now or what? Thanks my uber driver she presses the pedal and gasses.
  I hoped we were safe, but in a couple of munites she stopped the car near my hotel.
  Is my hotel so close to that place?? Holly shit i will stay in my hotel room forever.

  Although if my life is a movie, it means after that situation something good will
  happen. Definetly will! Life loves courage. Probably, tomorrow i will meet Leonardo
  Di Caprior and cook russian borch for him, who knows? But now i have to get some
  food and sleep.'
