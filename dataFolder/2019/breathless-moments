Text: "\u201CHe\u2019s been taken to hospital and has a 50/50 chance of making it,\
  \ we will know in the next 48 hours\u201D\n\nI choked on the thin air that clung\
  \ tightly to my throat, my chest tensed as I struggled to gasp my next breath and\
  \ simply put one foot in front of the other. The muddy uneven path that slowly snaked\
  \ up the mountainside was barely visible in the dim glow of my failing headtorch\
  \ and with every step I strained to watch my footing as my lungs silently screamed.\
  \ I was in Peru, 2430 metres above sea level, it was the middle of the night and\
  \ I was trekking to Machu Picchu for sunrise.\n\nWe arrived to greet a dawn shrouded\
  \ in a thick mass of white fog and I quickly found a spot to collapse on the floor\
  \ and wait it out. Lacking any sense of urgency, the clouds lazily parted, lifting\
  \ the morning mist in a gentle tease to slowly reveal an ancient citadel of intriguing\
  \ buildings and secret pathways. It was a magical world mysteriously created in\
  \ the middle of the sky, elegantly perched on a mountain face, abound with unexplained\
  \ archaeological awe and encircled in every direction by towering mountains and\
  \ panoramic vistas. \n\nBuzzing with an ecstatic feeling of wonder and accomplishment,\
  \ I floated back to the local tourist town of Aguas Calientes high on life. I had\
  \ been off the radar for a few days and decided I should check in with the parents.\
  \ The internet caf\xE9 was a basic room crammed with old looking computers and broken\
  \ keyboards half hanging off the wall, linked together in a mass of entangled wires\
  \ strewn across the floor, eagerly anticipating an accident.\n\nThis time it wasn\u2019\
  t the lack of oxygen that stole my breath, but the first words uttered unexpectantly\
  \ down the crackling line.\n\n\u201CHe\u2019s been taken to hospital and has a 50/50\
  \ chance of making it, we will know in the next 48 hours\u201D\n\nIt was a cruel\
  \ reminder of life\u2019s impermanence. In just one moment I transformed from an\
  \ invincible life loving woman to a scared little girl with a breaking heart. My\
  \ dad is a fit and healthy man in his fifties, he can\u2019t be lying unconscious\
  \ in a hospital bed with a bleed on his brain. Can he?\n\nI felt the outside world\
  \ around me fade away. Physically I was there, but mentally I was imprisoned inside\
  \ a mind gripped with fear and grief. My legs buckled, and I sobbed uncontrollably\
  \ in a messy heap amongst the plastic cables, oblivious to the audience of concerned\
  \ backpackers that had gathered. My body was weak, and the news had made me dizzy\
  \ and clumsy on my feet. Never in my life had I wished to be anywhere else in the\
  \ world but home, safe, in the loving embrace of my mother\u2019s arms, surrounded\
  \ by familiarity.\n\nThe next 48 hours of my life stretched out in a haze of anxiety\
  \ and unknowingness. I was staying in a hostel brimming with the warm energy of\
  \ happy go lucky souls excited about life and adventure. Yet amidst the fun and\
  \ laughter, I lay alone, curled up in bed with wide eyes, a racing heart and a mind\
  \ whirring with inconceivable thoughts.\n\nAlone and scared I endured 3 agonisingly\
  \ long days to find myself in the only place in the whole world I needed to be and\
  \ yet, in the very last situation any newly returned backpacker wished to find themselves\
  \ in. The nurse gently squeezed my mother\u2019s hand as the family sat around my\
  \ unconscious dad lying on the hospital bed, and whispered, \u201Cit will be a long\
  \ road to recovery\u201D. But he had made it, he had fought to stay alive and he\
  \ had won the odds.\n\nIt\u2019s 8 years later and my family are still on that road\
  \ and my dad still fights every day. I don\u2019t need to climb mountains and travel\
  \ the world to get my breath taken away, my dad is my biggest inspiration and he\
  \ does it every day with his perseverance to get stronger and his positivity and\
  \ drive for life."
