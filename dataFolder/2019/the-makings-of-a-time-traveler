Text: "Let's start with my fears. First, traveling solo. In my past, I've always had\
  \ a faithful companion. One to help me on my way, keep me entertained and entrust\
  \ with my safety.  A minimal fear compared to recent current events and on the forefront\
  \ of travelers' minds with the attacks in Europe. There are also travel barriers\
  \ (passports errors, visa expirations) language barriers, eating new foods, getting\
  \ yourself lost. And at the bottom of my list, the social faux pas in new countries\
  \ (not your typical socks with sandals.) Who knew in Thailand pointing is a no-no?\
  \ All incased by the fact that I'm a single woman, traveling alone. Not to be confused\
  \ with lonely single woman traveler. Very different. I'm not doing this because\
  \ I'm heart broken or looking for love or even to find a better sense of self. I\
  \ have a curiosity of cultures.\n\nI'd been flirting with the idea of a world trip\
  \ for the better part of my adult life. First encounter of my idea (for the sake\
  \ of a more romantic name for my curiosity let's call it Romeo) came the moment\
  \ I left on my own from South Dakota almost ten years ago. The feeling I had that\
  \ day is now a tattooed into my frontal lobe blocking my inhibitions. Moving from\
  \ the Mid-west to Arizona was not exactly around-the-world travel but the adventure\
  \ and spirit of forging on my own is still the same concept in my mind. I've learned\
  \ that once you've forced yourself past your comfort zone you truly test yourself\
  \ by confronting your fears head-on. \n\nMy friends and family were quick to give\
  \ their impression of my Romeo, spotting the obvious dangers and circumstances that\
  \ come with this sort of flirtation- stolen luggage, third-world diseases, imprisonment\
  \ and even risk being kidnapped as if I hadn't been thinking about that from the\
  \ start. \n\n\"You're sure to get the Hep,\" says my friend who also pronounces\
  \ Germany's third largest city, Munch, like she's eating a sandwich. \n\nRomeo started\
  \ with just Thailand. A country very different than my own, smiley people, colorful\
  \ temples and exotic cuisine. What is not to love? I consumed my research, for two\
  \ years. Everything Thailand. Signed a contract to teach English, felt like a new\
  \ Romeo at first but soon discovered this was too much of a commitment in one country\
  \ and without really even knowing the extent of this Romeo adventure, it turned\
  \ out to be too much. Fear took over. I panicked and took the 9-5 job offered to\
  \ me in my comfortable desert town.\n\nBut this is not the end of my story...\n\n\
  I learned to day dream. And any who has daydreamed know this is a fabulous trick.\
  \ It's like reading or falling in love or working out. You can time travel- day\
  \ travel, really. Time is a relative tape measure to the average person it can take\
  \ a long time to map out but to the expectant person, the person who has something\
  \ to dream, it can be a virtue.\n\nI would imagine myself a modern Amelia Earhart\
  \ or Nellie Bly the famous journalist, primed for a story to tell or mystery to\
  \ uncover and ultimately the aviator of my own adventure. I rummaged the local magazine\
  \ racks and travel sections of book stores looking for inspiration for my new Romeo\
  \ adventure.\n\nMy mother, an avid enthusiast of all things South Dakota, would\
  \ voice her disdain of my solo trip outside the homeland. After an hour conversation\
  \ of comparing apple cider vinegar to a shot of vodka, my mother slipped in that\
  \ my linage actually supported this wild idea of global discovery. She uncovered\
  \ our origin dates back to the Vikings and direct descendant of Roald Amundsen.\
  \ He was a Norwegian explorer, first to reach the South Pole and to navigate through\
  \ the Northwest Passage, putting its place on the map. This heritage I found through\
  \ my mother and was in my back pocket the whole time. So maybe we can call my Romeo\
  \ more than just a curiosity, a true genetic drive for adventure."
