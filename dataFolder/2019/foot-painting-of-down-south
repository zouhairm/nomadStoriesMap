Text: "Living in South Africa my whole life, I always knew that there was colour added\
  \ to the different cultures. But. Never knew that there was a new colour trail hidden\
  \ away; for only those who seeked would find. \n\nIt was first Thursday; almost\
  \ like a holiday kind of thing; South Africans all over the country celebrate the\
  \ first Thursday of every month by going to bars and getting crazy CHEAP deals on\
  \ drinks, And then there\u2019s the art gallaries. They open over the whole night\
  \ and hand out free different tastes of wine. Majority of the art gallaries are\
  \ mainstream and can be visited over any day. \n\u201CYou\u2019ve got to keep your\
  \ eyes wide open to spot the ones hidden away\u201D a friend of mine said. And true...\
  \ there are in fact these hidden away gallaries, that never open and people would\
  \ consider to not even exist. \n\nI went straight down a dark alley, hand-in-hand\
  \ with my friend; constant fear that you might get robbed- It is in centeral Jo\u2019\
  burg after all. A old battered red metal door stood before us, \n\u201CBe prepared\
  \ to be amazed\u201D Claire said to me as she slid the door open...  \nIt\u2019\
  s definitely not art from history, or those crazy status you\u2019d see in New York.\
  \ It\u2019s like a mixture between modern and almost children\u2019s mud sculptures.\
  \ \nAs you walk in through the door, you\u2019re welcome with a glass of wine (of\
  \ your choosing), and directed to look over some of the wall art in the first room.\
  \  \n\u201CEvery child is an artist. The problem is how to maintain being an artist\
  \ when we grow up\u201D said the very famous Pablo Picasso. A very clear view of\
  \ his statement is portrayed through these artists. \nI could stop looking over\
  \ a painting, honestly it wasn\u2019t something special; but yet captivated me.\
  \ \n\u201CThis artist won\u2019t put her name on her work\u201D said a gentlemen\
  \ looking over it too. \u201CWhy?\u201D I asked, \u201Cshe likes to leave a mystery\
  \ between a viewer and the creature- she wants you to think of what you want in\
  \ her work\u201D. This really baffled my brains, I could imagine not having my name\
  \ on something I worked so hard on. \n\nWe left the gallery sort after my strange\
  \ conversation, got into an uber and head into Newtown- one of the oldest parts\
  \ of Jo\u2019burg. \u201C There\u2019s lots more hidden in this part of Town; just\
  \ be alert; it\u2019s dangerous\u201D Claire said to me as we got out the car. \n\
  Old warehouse buildings with knocked out windows. I thought I was in the new Saw\
  \ movie. \n\nBefore you even get to the next gallery, you\u2019re joyed with some\
  \ amazing graffiti- It\u2019s like walking into a chocolate factory, but only with\
  \ paint and some insane penmanship.\nOnce again another metal sliding door will\
  \ stand before you: only this time when it\u2019s opens you\u2019re pulled into\
  \ the dark with only but a few small lights. \n\n\u201CBe quite and watch carefully\u201D\
  \ the hostesses instructed us. A bang went off and purple UV men appeared in the\
  \ far end of the room. \u201CIt\u2019s one of those art concerts\u201D popped into\
  \ my mind. A smile grew on my face, as we all endured a 30 minute show of what\u2019\
  s counted as modern day art. \n\nThe rest of the gallery held the shows theme too,\
  \ glow in the dark paintings, black and white statues, and human body art. I seemed\
  \ to bump into the very same gentleman from the previous gallery: \n\u201CWe met\
  \ again\u201D I challenged him. He chuckled and said \u201CI\u2019m Brandon\u201D\
  . We got to talking as we walked around the gallery, and found out that he knew\
  \ more about art than I did myself...."
