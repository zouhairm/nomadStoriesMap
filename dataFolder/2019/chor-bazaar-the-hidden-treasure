Text: "Stepped out of the CST railway station at 4 in the morning and I don't have\
  \ any idea about how to reach chor bazaar which is a flea market at Mumbai famous\
  \ for antiques. I used the Google map service which shows that it is closed at this\
  \ time still I walked through lanes to reach at the md ali road which is a nearby\
  \ place to the market there I inquired some people and they said that this is the\
  \ perfect time to visit this place they told me the path to reach there and I moved.\n\
  \ As I reached  that place it was totally empty and for Mumbai the city which never\
  \ sleeps this scene was kinda creepy, then I saw few peoples coming with some cameras\
  \ and stuff and I asked them if they know and they told me that they are going there\
  \ to make vlog at that exact same place so after walking for few minutes we finally\
  \ reached our destination. The place was full of people and things which is not\
  \ suitable at Same place and for that price not possible. From antiques to cutlery\
  \ from stationary to clothing perfume bottle with high label tags and some rustic\
  \ charms everything was so mesmerizing for a shopper like me.\nUltimately I found\
  \ one old ukulele at one shop which I can't resist to buy and I still don't know\
  \ how to play but grace wanderwall had hyped it enough .\n\nThen I came back after\
  \ wandering for almost two hours there. I saw some old cameras at mutton gully and\
  \ ate \" chicken sanju baba\" at Noor Mohamadi , which is an iconic one. When I\
  \ reached my hostel I was still excited to try my newly brought ukulele while touching\
  \ its cords I saw one signature on it , It says cliff Edwards . I look out for him\
  \ on internet and I don't believe on myself this instrument was signed by one of\
  \ the greatest uke player of all time."
