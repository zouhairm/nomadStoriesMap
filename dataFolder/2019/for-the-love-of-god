Text: "We traveled as a group of twelve, sometimes by bus or baby taxi, other times\
  \ by rickshaw or foot. We each carried with us our belongings and we had all packed\
  \ light. We were strangers to one another, with no idea what to expect. However,\
  \ we gathered for a purpose\u2026an inward journey to heighten our own spirituality\
  \ and bring noor\u2014light\u2014into our hearts and souls.\n\nWe were in one of\
  \ the heartlands of spirituality in the Muslim world. Bangladesh, with its rich\
  \ history of Buddhist monks and monasteries, became a center of learning for those\
  \ seeking a path to God and a connection to something greater than themselves. The\
  \ people are special. Their deep kindness and affection reflect generations of piety\
  \ and inner reflection. \n\nWe had come for four months, thin chilla, as it is called\
  \ in Bengali. We moved from mosque to mosque, village to village, starting off in\
  \ Naryangang, just outside of Dhaka and continuing out towards Netrokona, at the\
  \ Indian border. Some days we traveled and explored. Other days we stayed at the\
  \ mosques and studied. \n\nTo those less knowledgeable about Islam, we preached.\
  \ We told them about our purpose in life as our religion defined it \u2014to love\
  \ one another, stand in prayer, cry to the almighty for his mercy and forgiveness.\
  \ From those more knowledgeable, we learned. We came across, men who made no more\
  \ than a few dollars a day, but whose souls shined brighter than stars. They shared\
  \ their knowledge with us, smiles lighting up their faces as they spoke. Their sifat\u2014\
  inner qualities\u2014attracted us, and we would sit eagerly in circles to learn\
  \ the secrets to their piety.\n\nWe slept on the concrete floors of the mosques\
  \ and made meals of rice and different types of curries using makeshift firewood\
  \ ranges and handmade pots and pans, which we carried with us. We stopped by the\
  \ local shops for our necessities and invited the locals to eat with us and share\
  \ in our blessings.\n\nI joined different members of our group for tea each day.\
  \ We would step out of the mosque after the dawn prayer and walk alongside cows\
  \ and goats, through the often unpaved streets. We passed vendors selling fresh\
  \ baked roti and others selling coconuts and sugarcane, until we arrived at the\
  \ chai wala\u2019s shop. The tea was sweet, the conversations sweeter.\n\nAs time\
  \ went on, we grew more accustomed to Bangladesh and to each other yet before we\
  \ knew it, our time came to an end and the members of our group\u2014our jamaat\u2014\
  parted ways. We had come together to learn from each other, and we would take back\
  \ to our families the knowledge that we gained and the lessons we learned.\n\nDistances\
  \ traveled on our spiritual journeys were far greater than distances covered in\
  \ the physical realm. However, these journeys impacted each other, they were inseparable.\
  \ We are connected to the lands to which we go, to the earth, to the people, to\
  \ the cultures, stemming from each other. And there is wisdom to be gained from\
  \ it all. God calls us to this wisdom as he says in the Holy Quran: Do they then\
  \ not travel through the Earth, so that their minds gain wisdom and their ears thus\
  \ learn to hear? For surely it is not the eyes that are blind, but blind are the\
  \ minds which are in the foremost. 22:46\n\nWe need to listen to the stories of\
  \ others, even if they are told in foreign languages and dialects. We need to see\
  \ the beauty in the world around us to expand our consciousness. The heart needs\
  \ enlightenment, and it is the love around us which illuminates us."
