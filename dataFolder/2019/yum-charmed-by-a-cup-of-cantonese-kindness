Text: "Winnie pours the tea, adeptly minimising spillage onto the pristine white tablecloth.\
  \ Eugene taps two fingers on the edge of the table. I must frown slightly in puzzlement,\
  \ for he notices and explains to me that this is a Chinese gesture of thanks. Ever\
  \ keen to fit in, I appreciate this so-simple snippet of local know-how. \n\nI\u2019\
  m with my new friends at Yum Cha, the traditional Cantonese late-morning banquet.\
  \ There is tea of course, as Yum Cha means \u2018drink tea\u2019. That doesn\u2019\
  t mean that we\u2019re not eating. Far from it. Women in blue tabards are pushing\
  \ trolleys of food around the cavernous dining room.\n\n\u201CThey are called aunties.\
  \ Each auntie has different baskets of food. If we choose their basket, they will\
  \ stamp our card. This way, they are paid for their sales.\u201D Winnie is educating\
  \ me in the ways of Yum Cha, while simultaneously negotiating via hand signals to\
  \ a passing auntie that she would like three of her offerings. Off come the bamboo\
  \ lids to reveal prawn, pork and water chestnut dumplings (dim sums), sticky honey\
  \ ribs and char siu bau, fluffy steamed dough balls encasing sweet barbecued pork.\
  \  \n\nJust hours ago, I could not have anticipated this chance to dive into Cantonese\
  \ culture. My diary had me delivering a business presentation in the morning on\
  \ Hong Kong Island. Afterwards, I planned to write up my notes and, if time permitted,\
  \ fit in some sight-seeing. At the end of my demonstration I was introduced to one\
  \ of the delegates, Winnie, who had asked whether I would like to accompany her\
  \ and her boyfriend to a typical Hong Kong lunch. I didn\u2019t have to think twice\
  \ about accepting. Work could wait; this was a far better proposition than sitting\
  \ alone in a bland hotel room with my laptop.\n\nWinnie\u2019s boyfriend, Eugene\
  \ \u2013 I found myself wondering if they had chosen their English names from 90s\
  \ American TV shows \u2013 met us at the restaurant, six floors up from street level.\
  \ A foodie travel experience where the dishes are shared between all participants,\
  \ Yum Cha is a perfect choice for me, and I am so grateful to Winnie for suggesting\
  \ it. I wouldn\u2019t have done this on my own. Even better is to come.\n\n\u201C\
  Do you have a plan for the weekend?\u201D asks Eugene. It\u2019s hard to hear him\
  \ above the din of dozens of conversations. My mouth full of custard tart, I shake\
  \ my head. I had been intending to head to the 10,000 Buddhas Temple in Sha Tin,\
  \ but I sense an appealing offer looming. Sure enough, they invite me to join them\
  \ on a walk on Lamma Island. My broad smile was all the answer they needed. It will\
  \ be a great opportunity to enjoy Hong Kong\u2019s countryside in the company of\
  \ locals.\n\nWe convene next morning at Central\u2019s number six ferry pier and\
  \ catch the Lamma boat, rounding the western tip of Hong Kong Island and docking\
  \ twenty minutes later at Yung Shue Wan. It may be twenty minutes, but it feels\
  \ as if we have landed seventy years earlier. Here, away from the skyscrapers and\
  \ teeming humanity of Central, the pedestrian rules. Single storey huts with corrugated\
  \ iron roofs are de rigueur, the humid air is thick with incense from boutique shrines\
  \ and bicycles are the quickest transportation down a main thoroughfare so narrow\
  \ it would struggle to accommodate a golf buggy. The only indication that we are\
  \ in the 21st century is the mobile phone adverts on shopfronts. \n\nOur walk soon\
  \ takes us into countryside. Discussing everything from Chinese censorship to Mahjong,\
  \ we walk over hills with views of floating fishing villages, past a wind turbine\
  \ and down to a beach. Looking south down the bay, the South China Sea sniffs at\
  \ the sand. The eye is, unfortunately and irresistibly, drawn to the north-west,\
  \ where an enormous power station dominates. \n\nIt is the only blot on a wonderful\
  \ day\u2019s hiking and sharing stories, a day I would never have experienced were\
  \ it not for Winnie and Eugene\u2019s invitation. Thanks to my new Cantonese friends,\
  \ I have encountered aspects of Hong Kong life that I would have been unlikely to\
  \ discover as a single traveller."
