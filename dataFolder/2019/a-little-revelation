Text: "the 26th of March, last year, a friend called me at night. I knew Silvio since\
  \ a couple of weeks, we just moved to Oviedo, Spain, to spend our semester there\
  \ as Erasmus students. He called me and said he met a boy, a crazy boy, that offered\
  \ him to walk the Camino de Santiago: \"It's just five days walking, this boy has\
  \ a car and we can go together from Oviedo to La Coruna; he has friends in there,\
  \ they are going to host us for the first night and then we'll start!\". i was totally\
  \ unaware that i was going to make a decision that would create an unbreakable bond\
  \ between me and him, that would take me to explore the \"until-where-I-can-get\"\
  . \nTwo hours before departure I asked my housemate to land me her backpack, i filled\
  \ it with too many chilos of useless things and not even a pair of waterproof shoes\
  \ (I found out the hard way Northen Spain can be really rainy)., and jumped into\
  \ Silvio\u2019s friend\u2019s car. Immediately I understood that Ciccio (my new\
  \ friend) was one of the craziest person i will ever meet in my life. He could make\
  \ a joke out of everything: it has been one of the things that gave me strenght\
  \ during all the way down to Santiago.\n\nWhen we started the Camino, we were in\
  \ 6: me, Silvio, Ciccio, and three Ciccio\u2019s friends spending their Erasmus\
  \ semester in La Coruna: six erasmus students without any basic tool we could have\
  \ needed during the way. I remember that when we started walking, i didnt even know\
  \ how to lace that giant back pack that my house mate gave me. \nWe spent four days\
  \ walking on the hills of Galicia, from Ferrol to Santiago, walking for a total\
  \ of 124 kilometers. We saw a lot of horses, met other pilgrims, ate in a cimitery,\
  \ hid from the rain in a lonely, abandoned, bus stop in the middle of nowhere, slept\
  \ without any blanket, washed ourselves in a fountain, cursed because of the blisters,\
  \ sang until our voices broke, laughed about our profane travel.\n\nWe arrived in\
  \ Finisterrae, the \u201Ckilometer 0\u201D,  on Easter day, and after a week of\
  \ tortillas and ham, we decided to celebrate with a fish lunch (sometimes i still\
  \ dream about that white wine and that \u201Cpulpo\u201D). I didnt know the reason\
  \ why i decided to go, i couldnt under stand where i could have found the strenght\
  \ to keep on going, me, the laziest person I know; i didn\u2019t know what was i\
  \ looking for, and i was a little disappointed when, at the end of the road, there\
  \ was no mystical appearance that \u201Cmakes everything clearer\u201D, the one\
  \ that eveybody that did the Camino before talked about.\n\nAs soon as i sat on\
  \ my couch, in my house, i understood. The revelation, the one i was looking for,\
  \ the one everybody was talking about, was not a firework, or a bomb exploding:\
  \ it was a flore blossoming, one of those flowers i love so much.\n\nSince then,\
  \ i never stopped walking."
