Text: "We are exhausted. At 2:30 this morning our alarm went off, prompting us to\
  \ layer our clothing, fill our water bottles, and begin the ascent to Adam\u2019\
  s peak in darkness. The sun rose like a red orb and chased its shadow down the opposing\
  \ side of the mountain, and we glimpsed men and women kissing the sacred footprint\
  \ left by Buddha or Shiva or Adam, depending on which world religion one ascribes\
  \ to.\n\nBut now, the sun is high above us on a cloudless day, the heat heavy like\
  \ a blanket. We board the train from Kandy to Colombo, and Mark and I find two seats\
  \ across the aisle from each other, each sitting down with a satisfying whump. I\
  \ exhale and lean my head back, slipping into an almost-immediate sleep, but as\
  \ soon as my eyelids close, I remember the binder.\n\nMark and I are on a Global\
  \ Scavenger Hunt, competing against nine other teams to be crowned the \u201CWorld\u2019\
  s Best Travelers.\u201D We\u2019ve already forfeited the title\u2014we\u2019re so\
  \ far behind in points\u2014but we want to give our full effort anyhow, completing\
  \ challenges as per the rules: no smart phones, laptops, or Googling. I\u2019m in\
  \ charge of our logbook, gluing ticket stubs, recording times, writing answers to\
  \ questions. I have yet to record last night\u2019s scavenges, or Adam\u2019s peak,\
  \ or this train ride. I sigh and open the binder.\n\nThat\u2019s when I feel eyes\
  \ watching me. \n\nI glance around. Sitting in front of Mark is a beautiful girl\
  \ in a bright pink dress, staring intently at me until I meet her gaze. She quickly\
  \ turns to face the front of the train.\n\nI catch Mark\u2019s eye and he grins,\
  \ having watched her watch me. He pulls one of our team stickers from his backpack\
  \ and leans over the seat, offering a small present. She shyly grasps its corner\
  \ and turns to her mom beside her, holding it up and speaking in excited whispers.\
  \ When she turns to face me again, I show her my Nalgene bottle, adorned with the\
  \ exact same sticker, and she, too, affixes the sticker to her water bottle.\n\n\
  We smile at each other.\n\nSomething about her curiosity makes me rummage through\
  \ my bag until I find a tiny notebook. In it I draw a palm tree and label it \u201C\
  Palm Tree,\u201D with a smiley face. I pass the notebook across the aisle, her dainty\
  \ arm the color of a shadow, and she places the drawing into her lap and stares.\
  \ She begins scribbling on an adjacent page, and I expect her to draw a picture,\
  \ too. Instead, she hands me a page that says: \n\nMy Self.\nI\u2019m Sethumi. I\u2019\
  m nine years old. My favourite food is cake. My favourite color is pink. My ambishan\
  \ is teacher.\n\nI am stunned. This shy, unassuming girl has completely schooled\
  \ me, upending my assumptions about her brilliance. Granted, the Sri Lankans are\
  \ the most literate in South Asia, but their native languages of Sinhalese and Tamil\
  \ are more akin, in writing, to artwork than to script, with looping letters and\
  \ curly cues that flow together like the designs of a henna tattoo, quite unlike\
  \ the English alphabet. Sethumi, of course, can write both.\n\nFor the next two\
  \ hours, we exchange notes and drawings; she creates a self-portrait and a picture\
  \ of her cat named \u201CKitty,\u201D and I draw a map of the United States with\
  \ a star over Rhode Island. We discover that we are both only children, and we both\
  \ love dessert.\n\nShe disembarks two stops before ours. It\u2019s the only time\
  \ I hear her excellent English. \u201CThank you,\u201D she says, so quietly I almost\
  \ miss it. She lingers for a moment, deep brown eyes gazing at mine, before her\
  \ mom takes her hand and they wave goodbye, disappearing into the dusty crowd.\n\
  \nOn the Global Scavenger Hunt I will collect souvenirs from 10 countries, take\
  \ thousands of photographs, and save dozens of ticket stubs, but the object I will\
  \ treasure most is a small handwritten notebook filled with two biographies and\
  \ illustrations, worth no money, and no points, at all."
