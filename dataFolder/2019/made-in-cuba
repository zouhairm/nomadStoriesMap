Text: "This is it I thought. This is where I die. We stood in front of a building\
  \ covered in dirty, peeling, light blue paint, situated on a narrow alley like street\
  \ which felt miles away from the main boulevard we had turned off. As we entered\
  \ through the unlocked door into an unlit room, the still humid air gripped our\
  \ skin. The room looked as if it had been looted a long time ago leaving only dust\
  \ and debris covering the floor. We were escorted up a well-preserved wooden staircase\
  \ that led us to a clean illuminated living room. A young man and an older man stood\
  \ in front of us. Against one of the walls was a medium size table covered with\
  \ cigars.\n\n\u201CCohiba, el favorito de Fidel Castro,\u201D the young man said\
  \ as he handed me one of the cigars.\n\nWhen I booked my trip to Havana, Cuba, my\
  \ boyfriend gave me specific instructions to bring back Cuban cigars branded Cohiba\
  \ as no other brand would do. Not having done my research on how much a cigar cost,\
  \ I flew to Cuba for 6 days with a total of 600 Euros to spend between me and my\
  \ boyfriend\u2019s sister. We learned quickly that we were short on cash if I was\
  \ going to honor my boyfriend\u2019s request. \u201CWhatever you do don\u2019t buy\
  \ cigars from the street. They tell you it\u2019s a cigar fair and that today is\
  \ the last day, but it\u2019s a con,\u201D I could hear my friend\u2019s words in\
  \ my head as I weighed my options on how to get cigars while still being able to\
  \ eat every day.\n\n\u201CAmericans?\u201D a woman said as she suddenly turned back\
  \ after just having passed us on the sidewalk as we were heading to Obispo Street.\
  \ My sister-in-law and I looked at each other hesitant to tell the truth.\n\n\u201C\
  S\xED,\u201D my sister-in-law said. To our surprise, the woman\u2019s eyes widen,\
  \ and she gave a huge open mouth smile as if laughing without making a sound. She\
  \ went on to ask us what our plans were for the day. We told her we planned to go\
  \ to the art market as we all continued to walk towards Obispo Street. She told\
  \ us that the thing to do today was to buy cigars and that today was the last day,\
  \ so we had to act fast. \u201CSounds familiar,\u201D I thought to myself, but my\
  \ sister-in-law and I decided to be gullible for once in our lives to see where\
  \ it led us. The woman excitedly walked us to the light blue building not far from\
  \ where we were, so we could buy cigars.\n\nI was guarded as I looked down at the\
  \ several hundred cigars in all sizes laying neatly in their wooden boxes. The two\
  \ men who greeted us explained that they were cigar factory workers which only made\
  \ me more cynical about the situation.\n\n\u201CHow do we know they aren\u2019t\
  \ fake?\u201D my sister-in-law bluntly said in Spanish.\n\n\u201CPress along the\
  \ side of the cigar and feel for soft areas. A real cigar is hard and tight,\u201D\
  \ the young man explained as he demonstrated with a cigar.\n\nThe older man brought\
  \ out the Cohiba labels that normally wrap around the cigars and the sticker label\
  \ that seals the box. I took them in my hands and as I saw the shine of the holograms\
  \ in both the box seal and the Cohiba label, my hesitation began to fade.\n\n\u201C\
  How do you know each other,\u201D I asked the woman who had showed us the way.\n\
  \n\u201CThrough tourism. I\u2019m a lawyer by trade, but it only pays $25 a month,\
  \ so I teach salsa classes to tourists for $50 an hour close to here. You learn\
  \ what other people in the area do and you help them get business,\u201D the woman\
  \ explained.\n\nFor $100 less than the price listed at the government cigar store,\
  \ we bought a box of 25 real Cohibas. In less than an hour, two men gained half\
  \ a year salary selling us cigars, and I learned that Cubans after 60 years of Communism\
  \ are creative at finding opportunities everywhere."
