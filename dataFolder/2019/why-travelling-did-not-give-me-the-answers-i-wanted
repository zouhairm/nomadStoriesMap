Text: "Before I went travelling, I was having a lot of trouble figuring out what I\
  \ wanted from my life. I dropped out of university half way through, switched to\
  \ a business college, switched to another business college, and then put it all\
  \ on hold one credit short of graduation. \n\nAustralia had been calling to me for\
  \ a few years, and something inside me told me I had to go right away, or I would\
  \ never do it. I was hoping some time abroad would clear everything up for me, like\
  \ it did for people in movies and books. \n\nI worked 3 jobs and saved for about\
  \ 3 months, and bought a plane ticket to Perth, Australia where I knew at least\
  \ one person. I spent Christmas with her family, then got a room in a house to start\
  \ my new life. \n\nI eventually found a job at a \u201Cmarketing\u201D company.\
  \ This ended up being door to door sales, for commission only. This was the most\
  \ challenging thing I had ever done at the time, and in no way would I describe\
  \ it is a good job. But the culture was almost cult-like. All anyone ever did walk\
  \ talk about how incredible the job was in their cheery Aussie accents. I spent\
  \ the summer outside in the hot sun getting yelled at by strangers, and occasionally\
  \ making some money to cover rent. I got a great tan and learned a lot about myself\
  \ and what I was able to do. My presentation skills went up by about 500%. I did,\
  \ however spend many rides home in my trainer\u2019s car sobbing and questioning\
  \ everything about my decision to move across the world. It was extremely scary\
  \ and extremely difficult. \n\nOnce I decided to quit I was ready for something\
  \ different. I saw an ad for some cash-in-hand work in a food truck at a weekend\
  \ festival in Melbourne. On a whim I bought a plane ticket and booked a hostel.\
  \ The work ended up being more challenging than expected, 17 hour days in the hot\
  \ sun grilling German sausages on a huge swinging barbeque. But I met some amazing\
  \ people and made a good amount of cash. The owners of the truck ended up really\
  \ taking a liking to me and inviting me to drive up to Sydney with them for a 12-day\
  \ festival where they had multiple trucks. \n\nI drove up a couple days early with\
  \ them and helped set up, and they told me they wanted me to manage and run their\
  \ newest truck for them. This was a surprising amount of responsibility which included\
  \ many things I\u2019d never done before. There were some tasks I felt confident\
  \ in such as scheduling and hiring a staff, and some that I was completely petrified\
  \ of like turning the gas on and lighting the pilot lights under the deep fryers\
  \ every day. I worked 12 days straight, 17-19 hours a day, and slept in a truck\
  \ at night.\n\nAfter the festival was over I could say with absolute certainty that\
  \ there was nothing I could not do. I still believe this and never would have gained\
  \ this confidence without working in the food truck or doing door-to-door sales.\
  \ After this I had a very nice mound of cash in my pocket and with my new found\
  \ confidence got to do some real travelling. I went up north to Cairns and worked\
  \ for accommodation in a hostel. In Cairns I spent my money on skydiving, exploring\
  \ the jungle, road trips, and\u2026 probably an unhealthy amount of alcohol. But\
  \ what else does a backpacker do in Australia? These adventures or misadventures,\
  \ however you want to look at it, are what shaped me into who I am. Travelling did\
  \ not give me all the answers I wanted, but it gave me the right questions. Travelling\
  \ gave me the confidence to go after what I really want in life, and not to settle\
  \ for what\u2019s around me. I\u2019m still just as lost as I was before, but I\u2019\
  m learning to appreciate and gain value from being lost."
