Text: "It is said that after God had made every other place on Earth, He kissed the\
  \ world and where He placed His kiss, Madeira was created. Witnessing the island\u2019\
  s rare beauty was a dream come true without even realizing I had that dream in the\
  \ first place. I was eager to explore the world. Thanks to my parents, I had traveled\
  \ a lot, so I didn\u2019t think anything could impress me. However, nothing could\
  \ prepare me for the wonders of Madeira. Not knowing what to expect, my 16-year-old\
  \ self and my mum embarked on a journey that will stay in our memory forever.\n\n\
  Just like any other adventure story, we had to get there first. Easier said than\
  \ done. Three flights in one day sounded like a good idea, but the enthusiasm of\
  \ seeing the exotic island quickly evaporated and exhaustion kicked in. As the plane\
  \ was just about to descend to Funchal Airport, my mum thought it was worth mentioning\
  \ that we were heading for one of the most dangerous airports in the world. Why\
  \ dangerous? Well, it\u2019s surrounded by mountains, the runway is only two kilometers\
  \ long and if the pilot misses it, we end up at the bottom of the ocean. This surely\
  \ made my heart excited again!\nNeedless to say, we survived. I already had a feeling\
  \ that this wasn\u2019t going to be just another regular holiday. It was December\
  \ and the absence of snow felt unnatural, yet the Christmas lights around the city\
  \ made me feel like home. \n\nAfter arriving at the hotel, my memories of the timeline\
  \ get blurry. I believe we started with the lift from which we could get a better\
  \ view of Funchal. It was an eye-opening ride that showed me the wonders of Madeira.\
  \ I was craving for its beauty and secrets, and that desire was growing by the minute.\
  \ \n\nI recall the Santana houses with their adorable architecture and bold combination\
  \ of colors. \nI remember the compelling legend about the two lovers that found\
  \ what is Machico Bay today. \nAnother tale that is etched in my memory is of a\
  \ place called Nun\u2019s Valley where nuns found a safe haven from the pirates\
  \ attacking the island and hid their treasure. \nI can relive each and every moment\
  \ from the scary glass skywalk of Cabo Gir\xE3o \u2013 Europe\u2019s highest cliff.\
  \ The breathtaking view of the natural pools in Porto Moniz. The stunning Seixal\
  \ waterfall that rushes its waters straight into the ocean. \nI recall spending\
  \ time in nature where my favorite flower \u2013 the exotic Bird of Paradise \u2013\
  \ grew in every corner of the island. To me, it was a unique sight, but for the\
  \ people of Madeira, it was like what the dandelion is to me. A weed!\n\nWalking\
  \ through the markets was so rewarding - we heard many interesting stories from\
  \ the local people, we tried their famous pineapple banana and I discovered my love\
  \ for passion fruit. We ate their scary-looking Espada fish and drank their famous\
  \ wines, even though they tasted like cough medicine. We spent time by the pier,\
  \ collecting sunrays while enjoying our cappuccinos and listening to the enchanting\
  \ voice of the woman with flowers in her hair.\n \nNothing can compare to the unique\
  \ beauty of Madeira. When I say that I don\u2019t mean the special places or how\
  \ nice the people were to us, even though I remember all that vividly. I mean the\
  \ feeling that time doesn\u2019t exist there, that the rest of the world doesn\u2019\
  t exist. I mean, the sensation you get when the refreshing rain pours down on you\
  \ gently just when the heat of the sun gets unbearable. It is also the overwhelming\
  \ joy when seeing the colorful rainbow every time this fight of the elements occurs.\n\
  \nWhoever said that Madeira is the \u2018Kiss of God\u2019, felt what I have felt.\
  \ There are no better words for it. I keep going back to that ethereal place in\
  \ my memories and cherish each moment. There I found something I haven\u2019t (nor\
  \ I ever will) anywhere else on Earth \u2013 a piece of Heaven."
