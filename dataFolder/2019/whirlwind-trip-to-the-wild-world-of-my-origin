Text: "\u201CIt looks like a string of lights on the mountain slopes enveloped in\
  \ the warm embrace of the snowy clouds\u201D was my first thought as I stepped out\
  \ of the car into Milang and stared at the houses standing on long poles. I learnt\
  \ later that was the last time I would see the car as we would continue on foot\
  \ for the rest of the journey.\n\nAs a boarding school kid, I have lived a sheltered\
  \ life, but this new year, something has changed in me from within. Almost like\
  \ a catharsis. I took a trip with my family to my parent\u2019s native villages\
  \ namely Milang and Peki Modi, isolated from civilization and all modern comforts.\n\
  \nMilang is a tiny village with approximately 50 houses and 10 kms away from Mariyang,\
  \ the nearest town, from where the locals procure basic necessities like clothing,\
  \ utensils, salt, tea etc. They are mostly dependant on subsistence agriculture\
  \ and animal husbandry for their livelihood. There are no modern toilets or roads.\
  \ To answer nature\u2019s call there is a tiny hut supported by long poles & while\
  \ the deed is happening there are pigs below screaming for their dinner which is\
  \ [yes, your guess is correct} your excreta.  Whatever you say, can\u2019t deny\
  \ it is efficient. \n\nWe had to cross three mountains on foot for our next stop\
  \ Peki Modi which is connected to the last mountain via a hanging bridge. That fragile\
  \ structure is the last and only link to the rest of the world. Legend has it that\
  \ in the old days, due to incessant wars a lot of young people moved here from Milang\
  \ in search of better game. Shocking, as today there are only 12 families residing\
  \ here and the average age is 60. Funnily enough there is one modern toilet but\
  \ that is exclusively for Political leaders and tourists like me.\n\nLife is harsh\
  \ here with extreme weather conditions. It is almost as if time has stopped in Peki\
  \ Modi as one old gentleman shows the carcass of the mountain boar he hunted when\
  \ he was a young lad, now a decorative piece in his house. I can see the pride in\
  \ his eyes. He tells me, nothing has changed in all these years and yet everything\
  \ has changed, my father adds. Truer words have never been spoken."
