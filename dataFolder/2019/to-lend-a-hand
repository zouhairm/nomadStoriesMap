Text: "Two hours from the cacophony of bleating moped horns and overwhelming street\
  \ sounds, Can Gio Island is a welcome relief from the frenzied hive of Ho Chi Minh\
  \ City. The UNESCO-registered biosphere proves the ideal location to sequester ourselves\
  \ for the day; our guide explains that the 80,000 hectares provided a covert location\
  \ for the Viet Cong to establish a base during the war, even if this meant dealing\
  \ with the challenges of navigating the tightly interwoven mangrove roots and living\
  \ alongside saltwater crocodiles. Whilst the original base was destroyed, the reconstruction\
  \ provides an accurate representation of how the Viet Cong survived in the wetlands.\
  \ That is, I think that\u2019s what our guide is saying: it\u2019s hard to absorb\
  \ such a wealth of local history when you\u2019re eye level with the bulbous, bulging,\
  \ and alarmingly red genitalia of a brawny male monkey. \n\nNever one to delicately\
  \ overlook an opportunity for crude humour, I tug on my partner\u2019s sleeve and\
  \ surreptitiously gesture towards the unavoidable appendage. We titter and giggle,\
  \ momentarily shedding the respectable guise of a pair of young professionals, until\
  \ I notice that our childish delight is mirrored by a pair of middle-aged Vietnamese\
  \ women nearby. I do not need to turn to check if there\u2019s something nearby\
  \ that has attracted their attention: since we boarded the bus that morning, I have\
  \ been the unwilling object of their seemingly endless fascination.\n\nIt started\
  \ innocuously enough: as we walked through the bus, I\u2019d felt a gentle squeeze\
  \ on my bare arm and looked up to meet the matching toothy beams of the older women.\
  \ Taking it as a welcoming gesture, I had smiled back and continued along the bus.\
  \ I had erroneously believed that to be the extent of our interactions for the day.\
  \ \n\nThroughout the morning, I received an intermittent stream of increasingly\
  \ firmer squeezes and, later, pinches whenever I was within touching distance; these\
  \ were always accompanied by inexplicable smiles and waves which rendered me too\
  \ bemused to try and find an explanation for their behaviour. At one point, when\
  \ the pair were feeling particularly brazen, I felt a hand stroke my hair from crown\
  \ to tip before clasping me firmly on the shoulder; I merely offered an embarrassed\
  \ grimace and shuffled away awkwardly, feeling simultaneously uncomfortable and\
  \ yet bad-mannered for so overtly trying to put distance between us.  \n\nThankfully,\
  \ at Can Gio we are moving again; the guide ushers us forward, taking us deeper\
  \ into the reserve. The gnarled army of mangrove trees tower above us on either\
  \ side of the path; their arms spread and stretch towards the sky and their wizened\
  \ fingers weave and knot together, forming an arch. Removed from the frantic pace\
  \ of Saigon, we are free to amble along the path, stopping every so often to coo\
  \ over the baby monkeys with their tousled hair and gangly limbs. \n\nContinuing\
  \ down the dusty trail, we observe a solitary monkey with an explosion of yellow\
  \ fur. Warning us that this particular male is infamously aggressive in his pursuit\
  \ of snacks and souvenirs from tourists, the guide distributes piles of peanuts\
  \ from a cloth bag; dutifully we form a line to present the monkey with our offerings.\
  \ He greedily relieves each member of our small group of their peanuts and I am\
  \ soon stood in front of him. His lean and leathery fingers extend, and I momentarily\
  \ forget the guide\u2019s advice to keep my palms flat when offering food. The monkey\
  \ pounces. My wrist is caught in one hand whilst he uses the other to painfully\
  \ scratch and scrape any trace of food from my palm. Seconds later he is gone; only\
  \ his tail is visible as he clambers up a nearby tree.\n\nHeart racing and palm\
  \ stinging, I am utterly mortified to realise that I\u2019m about to start crying.\
  \ Clenching my jaw and blinking furiously, I feel yet another squeeze on my arm,\
  \ followed by another arm snaking around my shoulders and pulling me tight against\
  \ a chest much lower than my own; the two Vietnamese women surround me, quietly\
  \ chattering and rubbing comforting circles on my skin. Tentatively, I reach up\
  \ and place a hand on one of their arms, returning the embrace."
