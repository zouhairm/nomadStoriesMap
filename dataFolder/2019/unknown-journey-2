Text: "Travelling has always been fun and a great stress buster. You never know the\
  \ experience and adventure you are going to unfold. Exploring new places and meeting\
  \ new people, understanding their culture is always exciting and you a one step\
  \ ahead with your knowledge. But all journeys are not fun. It depends on your company,\
  \ the destination, especially if you are a women. You need to be protective and\
  \ alert. \n\nThis was my journey from India to Bangladesh. It  is the delta area.\
  \ Moist and \nsoggy soil. To explore the place and journey you need to be more on\
  \ road and your connectivity to the locals. No matter how much you are prepared\
  \ but some surprises are always waiting to be unfold. So I planned to travel by\
  \ road from kolkata to Dhaka. It was 12 hours journey. Literally crossing the border\
  \ gives you a very good and patriotic feeling.  I headed towards my journey on a\
  \  A.C luxury buses which is very common from kolkata. It took 4 hours to reach\
  \ the border. It was good journey. Once we reached t\xF2 the border, the security\
  \ post of an international border was a shock. The waiting area was pathetic. No\
  \ proper restroom. There was a long queue for immigration. Dirty and shabby area.\
  \ People urinating in the corners of the waiting area. The office was in old dilapidated\
  \ condition. After two long hours we got immigration and the we headed to take our\
  \ luggage to cross the border  No Personals were their to assist, our luggage was\
  \ to be dragged by us on the bumpy roads or else shed exorbitant amount to just\
  \ reach 10 meters border and again from border to your bus a few metres away. But\
  \ though with these hardships literally we crossed the border. One leg here and\
  \ one step in Bangladesh, totally a different feeling. Crossing the big gate which\
  \ remains open throughout the day. And once stepping in foreign country there is\
  \ a feeling of insecurity and responsibility of a citizen.  \n\nWe moved towards\
  \ Bangladesh immigration office. It was in a better condition than India. The formalities\
  \ were over and we were in Bangladesh having coconut water at the border. The currency\
  \ changed. We boarded the bus and started towards our destination. Crossing the\
  \ ferry was something to experience with all the buses on the ferry. There were\
  \ no roadside dhabas for proper food. The journey was not pleasant. Tourism department\
  \ seems to be neglecting the area.  We reached Dhaka around 10pm. A very small country\
  \ but with a big heart. Heavy and slow traffic is a part of the country. But its\
  \ a shopper's delight. Large range of garments at exciting prices. Currency value\
  \ is low so you can shop till you drop. Hospitality of the people is excellent.\
  \  They are food lovers and spread out a big table. At the same time they are very\
  \ health conscious.  They know how to maintain healthy diet.  They eat everything\
  \ in a proper and healthy way. \n\nThe market is very huge with large varieties\
  \ of goods. The price of food and foreign products are very high. Local products\
  \ are very cheap. There is a huge demand for Indian products and medical services.\
  \  People are big at heart and knows how to spend money. They live a big life in\
  \ a healthy way. Their are two section of the society, People are either very rich\
  \ or below poverty line. But the country is very good, well maintained though over\
  \ populated. Beautiful highways with good roadside dhabas. People try to maintain\
  \ their standard of living.  It was a pleasant journey and a journey to look forward\
  \ to visit again."
