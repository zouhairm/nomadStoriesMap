Text: "It all began with a short trip to one of the most beautiful places in colombia,\
  \ it is pretty near to santa marta. I was heading to a famous hostel named el coste\xF1\
  o beach, As soon as I arrived to the airport I decided to take a bus so I could\
  \ go to mamatoco, where I could take the bus to el coste\xF1o, It was about 7:00\
  \ p.m and the hostel was 3 km far from the road so I had to ask for a ride in a\
  \ motorbike to one of the locals, It was my first time travelling alone and you\
  \ know you hear stories about strangers, but in spite of that, I didn't let the\
  \ fear control me and I just started to talk with this really kind person. As we\
  \ were going to the hostel on the road under a cover full of stars he started to\
  \ recommend me some places to visit there, but he caught my attention when he mentioned\
  \ minca, specially because he said that there is not a more magical place than that\
  \ one. So after three days in coste\xF1o I decided to follow his recommendations\
  \ and travel to minca. When I arrived there I found a beautiful range of mountains\
  \ and tropical forest, a variety of birds among them the mighty hummingbird. As\
  \ I was hiking through that mountain looking for my hostel, a really kind person\
  \ named pablo helped me, as we were walking he started to tell me stories about\
  \ the hummingbird, I mean he was an expert and since you could find one of those\
  \ mighty birds in each tree, he knew a lot about them, but my favourite part was\
  \ when he said that the hummingbird had such a great meaning to him, because is\
  \ that in adverse situations, the hummingbird is able to lower its vital signs and\
  \ survive. And maybe each night might be its last, but if it survives the next day,\
  \ it reloads energy little by little and devours the day with joy and passion, as\
  \ if it were the last one it has to live. The hummingbird teaches us that life is\
  \ not the amount of days lived but the quality and intensity of each day that you\
  \ have to live as if it were the last one, and then he said it was the most fascinating\
  \ of these animals and I could not agree even more. It is quite magical what a trip\
  \ in a tropical range of mountains in colombia and a little animal can teach you,\
  \ the next days I found myself into a tropical jungle surrounded by birds but also\
  \ by monkeys, every single morning when I woke up I could see a naughty monkey in\
  \ my window actually we became really good friends, but besides the hummingbird\
  \ the most beautiful places in minca are its waterfalls. I must say that I defeated\
  \ a lot of my fears in this journey. One of them was my fear of highs, minca has\
  \ one of the highest waterfalls in colombia where I decided to face the fear and\
  \ do some extreme sports. I really enjoyed minca, if you want to relax or meditate\
  \ a little minca is the perfect place. What that trip left me was a beautiful and\
  \ new way of seeing the word. I also learned amazing things about the hummingbird\
  \ and  tasted one of the greates coffee in the world, I could go and hike some tropical\
  \ mountains and swam in one of the most beautiful waterfalls I had never seen. I\
  \ really recomend this place if you want to clean your mind and spirit of all the\
  \ trash that sometimes we get through our daily lives. Go to minca you will really\
  \ enjoy it."
