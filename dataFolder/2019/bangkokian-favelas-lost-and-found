Text: "I just had visited the Consulate of China in Bangkok because I needed to get\
  \ my visa. My flight back home departed from Shanghai, and it was irresponsible\
  \ enough to leave Mexico without it. I had waited long enough and for some reasons,\
  \ it was taking too long for they to deliver it.  \n\nI\u2019ve lived my whole life\
  \ as a foreigner in his own country. Back in 2000, what might occur in Venezuela,\
  \ made my mother took my sister and me out of the country. I was 11, and the complexity\
  \ of putting land to separate childhood from puberty, landed in the need of finding\
  \ a place to belong. \n\nBy the time I got to Thailand I hadn\u2019t spoken my language\
  \ for two months, and the voice in my head, that appears in every long trip, narrating\
  \ my days, had begun to speak in English as well. \n\nAs I arrived to The Erwan\
  \ Shrine, I found out that three weeks earlier, a terrorist attack had happened\
  \ and half of the sanctuary was covered. Fun fact, if the embassy of China would\u2019\
  ve delivered my visa on time, I would\u2019ve been in that place, that day, according\
  \ to my first itinerary draft. \n\nI started walking to Buda de Esmeralda shrine.\
  \ I felt so free and vulnerable, that I put a side Google Maps whom, (yes, whom),\
  \ had become my one and only friend among the journey. By 7 pm the sun was gone,\
  \ and I was lost.\n\nSuddenly, I found myself in a favela, an underground place\
  \ where the poor and the marginalized were placed by a society that forgot them,\
  \ where bed\u2019s sanctuary consisted in paperboard and old newspapers to separate\
  \ them from the cold concrete, and on top of these, weathered blankets. And there\
  \ I was, with an last generation iPhone on my pocket and a bag twice my size on\
  \ my back, living like a king in the city that discriminated them. \n\nThat was\
  \ the very first time I felt scared on a trip, and the voice in my head, with its\
  \ best intentions, was overwhelming me with its security advices. A 50 year old\
  \ woman gave me the directions I needed, and ahead to the Buda de Esmeralda temple!\
  \ She invited me to eat. Her son, I assumed, took me to the interior of their home.\
  \ The space was surprisingly cozy and warm, and there was only a couple of chairs\
  \ set in an improvised wood table, a small kitchen and a bathroom. But the light\
  \ of the moon sneaking over the holed sealing, my God, was a real privileged. The\
  \ young man asked me if I could deliver a message to his friend, his soul brother,\
  \ a Cambodian monk named Win. I wrote the missive down and promised him I will never\
  \ speak about it. \n\nThrough the eyes of that boy, I remembered an experience,\
  \ fourteen years ago, when I told my four-year-old sister, that I would travel until\
  \ I find for her, in this extensive and massive geography, a place to belong. \n\
  \nMy way into Bangkokian favelas took me across a longer distance than the (of course)\
  \ closed shrine. I deliver the message and Win was so grateful, that he allowed\
  \ me to teach English and geography to the kids and young adults in his community\
  \ school, and so, I spent two whole weeks teaching  and learning.\n\nI felt in love\
  \ with the most amazing man. He is that person who makes me want to be happy so\
  \ I can give him the best version of our lives we can have, but I\u2019ve never\
  \ forgotten that promise I made to my little sister, and I\u2019m up to it every\
  \ single day. So, I\u2019m into history, because I like to find the clues of what\
  \ brought us to this precise moment, but I prior on the stories of the present,\
  \ because what\u2019s happening now is the history that we are contributing to make.\
  \ It\u2019s what happens now what history books are going to be telling in 100 years,\
  \ and I don\u2019t what to be left out of those pages. \n\n(By the way, don\u2019\
  t worry, I got my China visa and be able to come back home)."
