Text: "I had been to goa many a times but it was just baga, calangute, candolim beach\
  \ everytime. This time I thought of exploring south. So i got a bus till Margao\
  \ and then hired a bike. After checking in to hotel, i got ready for day 1 and headed\
  \ to Palolem beach as its one of the famous beach there. It took me an hour to reach\
  \ there. (Quick little tip; on the way you will find colourful homes of local where\
  \ you can get best pictures for your instagram). Well the beach is not much crowded\
  \ as its in North, But as I reached in noon and in February its quite hot so I skipped\
  \ to go into the water n decided to chill on a shack. Then I got a body massage,\
  \ and just after that when I got out of massage place, there was a cute little cafe\
  \ named Art cafe. And two ladies were performing belly dance there (it wasnt paid\
  \ ,so cant assure it everytime you go there, but i guess I was lucky enough) Then\
  \ after relaxing a little bit, I shot some pictures as it was sunset and then left\
  \ the place. On the way back I found a little bakery which is at the first turn\
  \ itself (forgotten the name, but I guess its the only bakery there) I got a piece\
  \ of carrot cake which was good enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. And then I returned\
  \ back. The road on the way back was quite empty , but it was safe. Day 1 ended\
  \ with plenty of sleep.\n               As I had enough sleep I got up early in\
  \ the morning of day 2 and left for Fatrade beach (I saw a post on instagram and\
  \ that picture inspired me for this trip). Oh my god guys! I must say picture doesnt\
  \ do any justice to the beach. It was so mesmerizing, there were hardly few people\
  \ on the beach and just one shack. You usually dont find such beaches in goa. But\
  \ to my suprise, I found it. I met an elderly couple from Russia there. Though they\
  \ were 20 years elder than me, jogging with them was the hardest task of that day.\
  \  I taught them some yogasna and then after enough exercise I had my breakfast\
  \ on the shack. After relaxing a little bit, I said goodbye to those lovely couple\
  \ and then headed back (quick tip: keep some cash as there are no ATM nearby) As\
  \ I had most of my day left, i decided to explore Margao. Some shopping and some\
  \ food ended my day followed by dinner at my hotel. \n                Day 3 was\
  \ my last day , so i checked out from hotel and requested them to keep my luggage\
  \ untill evening (this way saved rent for a day). And bdw, forgot to tell you guys\
  \ that I stayed at oyo rooms. They are pretty decent and almost half the price of\
  \ any resort. Anyways after checking out I headed to Colva beach which is near by.\
  \ Its little crowded though but even that was fun. You will find many cafes there\
  \ and some good wholesale stores for cashewnuts (for those who don't know, goa is\
  \ famous for cashewnuts) I wouldn't say its cheap there but definitely you find\
  \ loads of variety there like you can get cashews with chocolate covering, with\
  \ strawberry covering, you can also get cashewchocolate fudge and many more stuffs.\
  \ Also you can have some aunthentic south Indian food there. After that I had some\
  \ time and some fuel left in my bike \U0001F61C So I decided to drive on the Manglore\
  \ highway. Took some good shots, had evening tea and returned back to hotel, thanked\
  \ the manager for taking care of my luggage and went to bus station from where I\
  \ had to catch my bus for goa. Its an overnight journey so tried not to get tired\
  \ much on the last day. \nThese were my 3 days of February this year. Hope you have\
  \ found itinary for your trip to south Goa. This completes my Goa trip and my 700\
  \ words."
