Text: "\u201COkay, so 11:00\u2026. But is that morning or night? Morning? Perfect.\u201D\
  \n\nIt\u2019s just past midnight in Monterey, mid-June, and I\u2019m helping a grad\
  \ student from Quebec figure out his birth chart. It's a Thursday night, we\u2019\
  re in a British-themed karaoke bar, and we met in the lobby of our hostel about\
  \ 40 minutes ago. My best friend is next to me, shaking her head as I slam my phone\
  \ down on the bar.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re a Sagittarius moon? Those are my favorite,\
  \ shut up.\u201D\n\nQuebec doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, but he\
  \ laughs anyway. A local is belting out a Carole King hit surprisingly on-key, our\
  \ coasters are emblazoned with Union Jacks, and I have to be awake early the next\
  \ morning. My friend and I arrived in Monterey earlier that afternoon with just\
  \ enough time to hike Big Sur, but we\u2019re leaving tomorrow for Porterville--the\
  \ final resting place of Charles Manson--where we\u2019ll be based for a couple\
  \ days to scope out the Sequoias. \n\nTime (and drinks) elapse, and I dare Quebec\
  \ to name 10 American presidents. He succeeds brilliantly, and asks how many Canadian\
  \ prime ministers I can recall.\n\n\u201CTrudeau! Trudeau\u2019s dad. Uh, Stephen\u2026\
  \ Stephen something-with-an-H! Not Hawking.\u201D\n\nIt\u2019s almost an international\
  \ incident, but for some reason Quebec doesn\u2019t leave me in this bar. He stands\
  \ up and asks, \u201CYou guys want to take a walk? I know the way back.\u201D\n\n\
  My friend and I look at each other. It\u2019s getting late, we don\u2019t totally\
  \ know where we are, and we\u2019re running on empty after a string of early-morning\
  \ alarms and long interstate drives. But we both shrug, because our road trip of\
  \ the American West is happening and we aren\u2019t about to hit the pause button\
  \ on an adventure.\n\n\u201CYeah, let\u2019s go.\u201D\n\nAnd we walk out into the\
  \ humid Californian night.\n\nQuebec lights up a cigarette as he walks and he tells\
  \ us about his summer so far: a school trip to San Francisco, a couple nights in\
  \ Santa Barbara, and this, the final stop on his journey. We share our story with\
  \ him in return: six states, 10 National Parks, and places to stay booked just until\
  \ Tuesday. We\u2019re not sure where we\u2019ll end up that night. (We later discover\
  \ it will be New Mexico.)\n\nWe walk down Cannery Row under streetlights, Quebec\u2019\
  s cigarette smoke swirling behind us like a current. There\u2019s a slight drop\
  \ onto a rockbed, and the Bay is there. I sit, skip a few stones, try to find the\
  \ Big Dipper despite clouds. It\u2019s nearing 3:00 now, and when we leave the Bay,\
  \ Quebec points west. \n\n\u201COur hostel\u2019s back that way, near the aquarium.\
  \ Let\u2019s walk the wharf.\u201D\n\nWe take our leave towards Fisherman\u2019\
  s Wharf, the tourist-occupied pier covered in high-priced seafood restaurants and\
  \ souvenir shops. One building stands out in particular, neon pink and situated\
  \ at the very end of the wharf. A fish-shaped sign dignifies it as one of those\
  \ seafood places of my vegetarian nightmares.\n\nThere are stairs leading up to\
  \ the fish on each side, gates pulled in front of them for the night, but I\u2019\
  m moving before I can think twice about it. Over one gate, up the stairs, and then\
  \ a decision: do I turn back, descend to the deck, or do I hop the railing to the\
  \ roof?\n\nI hear my friend\u2019s voice behind me--\u201CBec, don\u2019t do it!\u201D\
  --and that\u2019s really all it takes.\n\nOne foot on top of the railing, one hand\
  \ braced on the flaking pink paint, and I\u2019m up.\n\nBehind me: Old Fisherman\u2019\
  s Wharf, my best friend and the click of her camera, the blinking lights of Monterey.\n\
  \nTo my left: Quebec, hopping down from the railing onto the roof.\n\nIn front of\
  \ me: the Pacific Ocean, the rest of the world."
