Text: "Today is the 59th day I arrived here. \n\nI am sitting in the classroom and\
  \ staring at my laptop screen while shivering in the cold, as I always do in the\
  \ university. Two questions are lingering in my mind - who am I and where am I?\n\
  \nI am Yu undoubtedly. But I am also Amanda. \n\nYu speaks Mandarin and chats with\
  \ her friends in Nanjing dialect. Amanda speaks English and is too shy to pronounce\
  \ Cantonese. They never meet each other, but they share eyes and empathy. They observe\
  \ in silent and tell each other what the new world is like.\n\nHong Kong is a gigantic\
  \ monster. It swallows hundreds of thousands of people and squeeze them into separate\
  \ tiny little cubics. MTR lines and highways are blood vessels, carrying people,\
  \ or in another word, cells, shuttling back and forth in the body. It has an abnormal\
  \ biological clock - looking sleepy in the daytime but brimming with vigor at night.\
  \ \n\nWired. \n\nAsians talk in English fluently. Children in kindergarten read\
  \ a lot in both Cantonese and English. Churches are adjacent to temples. Luxury\
  \ hotels are opposite market stalls. Housing price is incredibly high but a large\
  \ number of people are still enthusiastic about buying more. Strictly speaking,\
  \ there are no four seasons here. Two adjectives - hot and cold, are the only standards.\
  \ Go outside and you will sense the scorching heat in the sun, but when you stay\
  \ indoors, the freezing cold air coming from the air-conditioning system pulls you\
  \ back to winter in a blink of an eye. Almost everyone works overtime and is absolutely\
  \ worn out, but they always insist on grabbing a beer in the pub. Women wear delicate\
  \ makeup and men are dressed in tailored suits. They flock from underground stations\
  \ and walk into the bar elegantly as if they have never tasted poignancy. Just pour\
  \ a mug of mojito, raise the glass, take a sip of it, turn around and whisper in\
  \ their colleague\u2019s ear. People complain bitterly about the land, but they\
  \ deeply rely on it. People make no secret of hatred for it, but they never leave\
  \ and even express strong love for it.\n\nLovely.\n\nHong Kong is mostly sounds\
  \ and visions to me. The streets are scattered with multicolored buildings - ruby\
  \ roofs, navy windows, amber walls, \u2026 and assorted bold graffitis. Trams painted\
  \ with colorful advertisements tinkle on the roads. Open your eyes and you may capture\
  \ the splendid light and shadow of the Time Square. Close your eyes and you may\
  \ hear sparrows chirp outside the window in mornings. Look at the faces here. Happy,\
  \ sad, excited, depressed, \u2026. Tons of adjectives can be used to describe those\
  \ faces. They belong to the black, the white, the yellow, etc.. They belong to Chinese,\
  \ British, Pakistani, etc.. They belong to businessmen, students, tourists, etc..\
  \ Interestingly, the more central you go, the more facial expressions you will see.\n\
  \nLast week, a busker, a thin man wearing a white T-shirt and denim jeans, was performing\
  \ music in Causeway Bay station. He rested a pot-like instrument on his lap, tapped\
  \ it with his palms and fingers slightly and shook his body to the rhythm. The tune\
  \ penetrated my ears and flowed around me like a stream. I felt that I was in touch\
  \ with some realm of spirituality which soothed me unconsciously. I stood there\
  \ quietly, gazed at him, and indulged myself in the melody. All of a sudden, a little\
  \ boy went towards him. He reached out his small hand and touched the steel \u201C\
  pot\u201D. Ding\u2026. The child\u2019s eyes widened and giggled joyfully. He seemed\
  \ excited that the big black \u201Cpot\u201D could make such a beautiful sound.\
  \ The man looked at the boy and gave him a dazzling smile. I stood there, smiling.\
  \ \n\nNow I am lying in bed, typing on my keyboard. Curiously, I draw back the curtains\
  \ and look out of the window. The night is ablaze with sparkling lights. Where are\
  \ you? Hong Kong, definitely. Only here can you experience daytime at night. Miss\
  \ your hometown? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter. I believe it is the intensity of\
  \ the time that makes all the difference."
