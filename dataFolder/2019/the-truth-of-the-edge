Text: "He called himself El Ternero, The Calf. He joked about it as he drove us to\
  \ the edge of a Costa Rican rainforest. \u201CIt\u2019s because I have a small body,\
  \ but a big head,\u201D he laughed. My sister and I laughed too, taken by El Ternero\u2019\
  s sincerity and giddy with excitement. We had never been ziplining, and I, having\
  \ a healthy fear of heights, was particularly jumpy. As we drove up one of the bumpy\
  \ roads, speeding around puttering Nissans and lumbering trucks, El Ternero pointed\
  \ to a bridge in the distance. We could make out the outline of two shacks, one\
  \ on either side of the bridge. One was white and the other, blue. \n\u201CIf you\
  \ decide to do bungee jumping, go to the white one.\u201D \nI chuckled at the instruction.\
  \ We had not mentioned bungee jumping at all. I asked him how often he jumps. To\
  \ my surprise, El Ternero shook his head. \u201CNunca. Never. But my niece goes\
  \ all the time.\u201D \nThat was the end of that conversation. El Ternero started\
  \ talking about the best places to buy souvenirs, and I stared out the window at\
  \ the thickening trees, already lost in the forest.\nHow I ended up on the edge\
  \ of platform off the side of a bridge still isn\u2019t completely clear. One minute\
  \ we were on our way back from ziplining, excitedly sharing the experience with\
  \ our charming guide. The next minute we were pulling up to the bridge and getting\
  \ fitted for harnesses.\nWe were nervous, so the deal was that El Ternero had to\
  \ jump too. He almost didn\u2019t and I was almost granted a reprieve. But he did\
  \ jump and so did my sister, and there I was, the last to go, trembling on the edge.\n\
  The first time I was on a ledge like this was when I was a twelve-year-old camper\
  \ on a canoe trip, at the mercy of my teenage counsellors. We had stopped to cool\
  \ off in a quiet backwater when one counsellor pointed up at the cliffs surrounding\
  \ our tiny fleet and said, \u201CWanna jump?\u201D \nI did jump then. I joked later\
  \ that it was the peer pressure, and that if my mother ever asks, \u201CIf all your\
  \ friends jumped off a cliff, would you jump too?\u201D that I could honestly say\
  \ that yes, I would. That was only part of the story, though. I climbed that cliff\
  \ because I wanted to know that feeling. I wanted to experience that experience\
  \ while I had the chance to do so. Still, when I shot back up through the lake,\
  \ shaking water from my head, I had promised myself, \u201CNever again.\u201D\n\
  Luis, the owner of that white shack on the side of a bridge near San Jose, counted\
  \ down. \u201CCinco, quattro, tres\u2026dos\u2026uno!\u201D \nI did not jump.\n\
  The platform was not going to release beneath me, nor was I going to get a friendly\
  \ push. In order to bungee jump, I would have to make the decision. I would have\
  \ to choose to go into the air, 84 metres above the water and rocks below. It was\
  \ not a choice I was prepared to make. I turned back toward Luis. I looked with\
  \ wide, terrified eyes at my sister and El Ternero. I shook my head. Then I heard\
  \ shouts from the sidelines. Several tourists had gathered on this rather secluded\
  \ bridge, attracted by the screams and cheers of the first two jumpers. \n\u201C\
  Puedos hacerlos!\u201D (You can do it!)\n\u201CSaut!\u201D (Jump!)\n\u201CAl Tid\u2019\
  agi!\u201D (Don\u2019t worry!)\nI had my own polyglottic cheering section.\nLuis\
  \ laughed and started counting down again. I chose the experience. I jumped.\nThe\
  \ air rushed around me, unleashing a hurricane in my head. The trees zoomed by and\
  \ the rocks bounced. My heart had never pounded like that. It wasn\u2019t quite\
  \ fear, nor was it excitement. It was just newness, a flood of feelings my body\
  \ found confusing, then joyful.\nWhen I was hoisted back on the bridge, I was trembling\
  \ violently and laughing uncontrollably.\nEl Ternero grinned and said, \u201CI told\
  \ you, eh! Choose the white one!\u201D \nI smiled back at my new friend. \u201C\
  You were right,\u201D I answered. \u201CGood choice.\u201D"
