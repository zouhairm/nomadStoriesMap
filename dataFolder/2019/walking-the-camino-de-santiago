Text: "Making spontaneous decisions while solo travelling the globe can sometimes\
  \ lead to moments where you ask yourself: \u2018how did I end up here?\u2019. This\
  \ was certainly a question I asked myself several times when I decided to walk the\
  \ Camino de Santiago in northern Spain back in 2013. \n\nIt was as spontaneous a\
  \ decision as one could wish to make. I happened to purchase a Paulo Coelho novel:\
  \ \u2018The Pilgrimage\u2019 \u2013 which details the author\u2019s walk across\
  \ the Camino, whilst travelling in northern India. Feeling inspired, I hopped on\
  \ the next plane to Barcelona and within a week I began my own Camino adventure,\
  \ uncertain of what exactly I was letting myself in for.\n\nMy adventure started\
  \ on the east of Spain in Pamplona on the eve of the Fiesta de San Fermin \u2013\
  \ the Running of the Bulls \u2013 an annual festival where bulls chase down adrenalin\
  \ junkies running for their lives. Timing is everything, and the question of \u2018\
  how did I end up here?\u2019 was running through my mind on repeat as I was overwhelmed\
  \ by the party atmosphere. Hundreds of people dressed in traditional red and white\
  \ colours continued to drink copious amounts of vino throughout the night while\
  \ I watched on bemused, confused and taken aback. Talk about a culture shock!\n\n\
  The next morning I watched the running of the bulls as best as I could through crowds\
  \ of rowdy (and hungover) Spaniards as the brave (and foolish) men ran for their\
  \ lives through the streets, soon followed by the stampede of bulls chasing them\
  \ towards the destination of the nearby bullfighting stadium Plaza de Toros which\
  \ Hemingway loved so much back in the 1920\u2019s.\n\nOnly 700 plus kilometres separated\
  \ me from Santiago de Compostela. Doubts danced through my head that first morning\
  \ as I seriously questioned if I was cut out for the pilgrimage ahead. They do say\
  \ the first few days are the hardest as you struggle to adapt to the Camino way\
  \ of life \u2013 walking, walking and more walking. Those first few days I battled\
  \ with my doubts and I\u2019m glad I did. As the days turned into weeks I fell in\
  \ love with the rural Spanish way of life as the Camino proved to be extraordinarily\
  \ magical. \n\nI remember meeting a French pilgrim by the name of David. David was\
  \ very enthusiastic when it came to spirituality and over dinner in a donativo he\
  \ professed to me how the Camino can change your life, and because you are walking\
  \ under the Milky Way this heightens your ability of manifestation. You\u2019re\
  \ thinking about money? Then money will manifest ten minutes later further down\
  \ the road. You\u2019re looking for love in your life? Then who knows who you might\
  \ meet on the Camino.\n\n'Why am I doing this?' I contemplated that question more\
  \ and more as my Camino adventure continued. Not only that, but why does anyone\
  \ really travel for extended periods of time? To seek happiness that is lacking\
  \ from their lives? Love? Adventure? Why do any of us take that step into the unknown\
  \ void and leave our comforts behind? \n\nReaching beautiful Santiago de Compostela\
  \ are said to be buried was something of an anti-climax to say the least. Five weeks\
  \ had passed since my rocky beginning back in the east of Spain and everything lead\
  \ up to this moment; would I feel some great epiphany as I reached the steps of\
  \ such a historic monument? Would my questions finally be answered? Nothing. My\
  \ female companion shook her head in disbelief with my lack of any real reaction:\
  \ \u2018Typical British. No emotion\u2019. \n \nIt wasn\u2019t until months had\
  \ passed after my Camino adventure that I could reflect properly on the experience.\
  \ What had I learnt? I learnt that when travelling you have to truly let go of any\
  \ fears and doubts and remain open to whatever experiences come your way, whether\
  \ they be good or bad, the road will lead you to where you need to be, as clich\xE9\
  d as that may sound. People come into your life and lessons are learnt and while\
  \ we are each unique and different, ultimately we are in many ways the same."
