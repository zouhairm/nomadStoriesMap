Text: "We had left camp at 10:00 pm and we were expected to reach the summit around\
  \ sunrise.  My heart was beating in anticipation as we left Barafu camp to summit\
  \ Africas tallest mountain, Mt. Kilimanjaro. \n\tA few hours into the hike, all\
  \ I could feel was the freezing cold air was whipping across my face and my toes\
  \ completely numb. I gazed down at my feet urging them to keep moving and I looked\
  \ up the mountain to see how much further we had to go until we reached the summit.\
  \ There were about a hundred people in front of me, I could only see the outlines\
  \ of their bodies through the glow of their headlamps and the full moon above. The\
  \ summit was still so far away. For the first time on this hike I was starting to\
  \ feel anxious, so many thoughts were going through my head: \u201C Was everyone\
  \ in my group okay? Am I going to have to turn back? Are my toes okay?\u201D.  \
  \ I had been fine on other challenging parts of this hike like when we had to scramble\
  \ up Barranco Wall and I had loved the challenge of climbing to the base of the\
  \ lava towers even though the air was thin at 4,530 meters. Even hiking down steep\
  \ shale for two hours using only my headlamp for visibility felt exciting. The feeling\
  \ I had now was different. I was worried about my feet and how cold I was.  \u201C\
  Mama Kiki, are you okay? \u201D I looked up and saw Ezekiel our waiter and head\
  \ porter looking at me with concern.  Throughout the hike we had all received Kilimanjaro\
  \ nicknames, I was told that my nickname was influenced by one of Tanzania\u2019\
  s unique naming traditions where mothers take on the name of their firstborn. My\
  \ daughter's name is Kiki and for the remainder of my Kilimanjaro hike I was proud\
  \ to be named Mama Kiki.   \n Ezekiel was always smiling, signing, and laughing,\
  \ but now his gaze was serious and his eyes were full of concern. \u201CEzekiel,\
  \ I can\u2019t feel my feet, I'm so cold\u201D.  Right away Ezekiel sat me down\
  \ and in Swahili asked somebody for some warm water.  He took off my shoes and socks\
  \ and put my feet up under his shirt onto his warm body. He warmed up both my feet,\
  \ put my socks on, and then wrapped a hot water bottle to his chest and one to my\
  \ chest. I felt relief that I could feel my toes again and I continued to hike slowly\
  \ up the mountain. Unfortunately, about an hour later my feet were completely frozen\
  \ again and I was getting very sleepy. Ezekiel was beside me the whole way and when\
  \ I wanted to stop and sleep he wouldn\u2019t let me, and when I couldn\u2019t feel\
  \ my feet he would warm them against his body. His gentle words of encouragement\
  \ helped me continue hiking: \u201CYou are strong Mama Kiki, your legs are strong,\
  \ you will get to Uhuru peak\u201D. \n When we reached Stella Point the sun began\
  \ to rise and the feeling of the warm light on my body was enough to convince me\
  \ I could survive the next hour until the summit.  I sat down and everything was\
  \ foggy. There was a friend of Ezekiels trying to get me to drink a slushy peach\
  \ juice box, Ezekiel was warming my feet one last time, someone popped a mint in\
  \ my mouth and then Ezekiel looked at me intently and said: \u201CDada (sister),\
  \ Uhuru peak is right there. Ready?\u201D. For the first time in hours I spoke:\
  \ \u201CEzekiel, I am so ready\u201D. \n  We hiked strong until we reached the summit\
  \ where Ezekiel pushed me ahead of the line of people waiting to get their famous\
  \ summit picture.  \u201CMama Kiki\u2019s has to get through!\u201D he shouted.\
  \   I felt so proud of myself from finding the strength and determination I didn't\
  \ know I had. I also felt a deep gratitude towards Ezekiel. I will forever be grateful\
  \ for him and his kind heart.  He is one of the most lovely humans I've met and\
  \ through our experience on Mt. Kilimanjaro he taught me the importance of believing\
  \ in myself."
