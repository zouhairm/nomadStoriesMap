Text: "\u201CI would run for it now, if I were you\u201D, said the Montenegrin farmer\
  \ as the black cloud raced over the top of the Durmitor mountains. I was sitting\
  \ in a small wooden shelter he had built by the side of the gravel road, drinking\
  \ beer pulled from a small well filled with ice-cold spring water, just the tonic\
  \ after a hasty retreat down the mountain. I looked again at the thunderclouds and\
  \ hesitated, enjoying the peace of the moment.\n\nThe skies had started out bright\
  \ blue as I set off on my first foray into the mountains in Durmitor National Park.\
  \ From \u017Dabljak, Montenegro\u2019s largest ski resort, it was a gentle walk\
  \ to the park entrance, past the summer camps and mountain houses filled with families,\
  \ children playing in the yards and adults drinking their morning coffee on their\
  \ balconies. Most other park visitors were headed straight to Crno Jezero, Black\
  \ Lake, with its cafes and picnic spots, boats for hire, swimming and trails around\
  \ the lake through the pine forests.\n\nBut I turned right, heading into farmland\
  \ surrounding the mountain peaks, past neatly fenced pastures with horses and cattle,\
  \ and sturdy wooden houses and barns with roofs built to take the deep winter snows.\
  \ To the left rose the Durmitor mountains, culminating in Bobotov Kuk, with hiking\
  \ trails to its summit at over 2,500m. But mine was a stroll, a random wander, rather\
  \ than a destination to be reached, a summit to be conquered.\n\nI followed a gravel\
  \ road to the base of the nearest mountains, past the shelter offering self-serve\
  \ drinks. The road ended in a track leading into the forest, and followed a deeply\
  \ eroded gully, dry now, but seemingly formed by fast flowing water judging by the\
  \ tree branches stacked haphazardly on the outer edges. The track climbed steeply\
  \ now, winding through moss and ferns clustered around the base of the tall trees.\
  \ I had the forest to myself, allowing time to pause and savour the deep shade,\
  \ at least until the mosquitoes descended and forced me onwards.\n\nThe climbing\
  \ track eventually levelled out onto a plateau, where the trees had been cleared\
  \ for summer grazing pastures, and were replaced with wildflower meadows. Yellows,\
  \ pinks, white and green replaced the deep shade of the forest, and the smell of\
  \ sage and thyme mingled with pine. Far below was Black Lake, living up to its name\
  \ from this height, with the occasional pixel of colour where someone was kayaking\
  \ on the lake or having a picnic under a bright umbrella. The Durmitor massif was\
  \ now clearly seen to the south-west, with the first cumulonimbus clouds forming\
  \ over the escarpment, breaking up the deep blue of the sky.\n\nThe track became\
  \ a single path leading across the plateau, with a steep drop down towards Black\
  \ Lake on the left, and forest remnants, wildflower meadows and rocky outcrops interspersed\
  \ across the landscape. The occasional bird calls were joined by a more metallic\
  \ sound, the alpine melody of cow bells. Although they were unseen below the track,\
  \ their use of the path was confirmed by regular cowpats to avoid. \n\nWith no deadline\
  \ or destination in mind, it was easy to wander without paying much attention to\
  \ the horizon. But the sound of rolling thunder, faint at first, but slowly coming\
  \ closer, brought me back to earth. The walk back across the meadows now had some\
  \ urgency, a hike rather than a stroll. Plunging into the forest, and heading back\
  \ downwards, the sky was lost to view but the thunder became a more constant companion.\n\
  \nReaching the bottom of the track, but still with some kilometres to walk, the\
  \ shelter and its refreshments beckoned. \u201CWhat\u2019s the worse that could\
  \ happen?\u201D I thought, \u201CA drenching?\u201D as I sat down and pulled my\
  \ jacket from the backpack. The clouds were now racing across the mountain behind\
  \ me and cascading down the slope. The farmer walked over from his house to give\
  \ me his warning. But too late. First torrential rain and then hail pelted down\
  \ on the tiled roof. The farmer had run for home but I was left to enjoy the might\
  \ of a summer thunderstorm on my own."
