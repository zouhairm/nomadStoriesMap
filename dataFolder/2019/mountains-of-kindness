Text: "We\u2019d heard plenty of things about Taiwan - the variety and quality of\
  \ food and drinks and the warm, welcoming culture. This hearsay became reality when\
  \ our travels took us up into the Nantou County Mountains. In retrospect, we should\
  \ have guessed that a township like Ren\u2019ai (translating to \u2018Human Kindness\u2019\
  ) would be a showcase of Taiwanese culture.\n\nWe\u2019d spent the day in our nondescript\
  \ rental car, winding increasingly higher through central Taiwan\u2019s tea country,\
  \ our noses filled with the scent of the wild tea bushes that sprouted everywhere.\
  \ \n\nNow, we found ourselves nestled in the shadow of the mountains. After dropping\
  \ our bags at a comically elegant Swiss-Alps-meets-Taiwan chalet, our stomachs dutifully\
  \ reminded us that they had been ignored for too long.\n\nThe chosen restaurant\
  \ specialised in Aboriginal food, and evidence of this theme was apparent in the\
  \ several faded costumes on display in the entrance. The eating area itself was\
  \ unassuming and nearly empty, with the exception of one table that held a big family.\
  \ \n\nWith a hesitant smile, a Laoban with deep smile-lines showed us to our seats,\
  \ handing us a menu that only Google Translate could hope to understand. Using my\
  \ inadequate Mandarin, I chose a set menu for two, then settled in for a hearty\
  \ meal. \n\nThe steaming bowls, mugs and platters filled the table and did not disappoint,\
  \ but our goal to finish the whole meal became increasingly unrealistic as the table\
  \ got heavier.\n\nWe\u2019d made it to dessert and were midway through a diamond-shaped\
  \ Jasmine tea jelly studded with goji berries when the family\u2019s voices echoed\
  \ through the restaurant. First, they sang the Mandarin Birthday song (Shengri Kuali),\
  \ then \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019, with gusto. We quietly hummed along, surprised\
  \ and amused that they would bother to include the English version.\n\nMoments later,\
  \ the Birthday Boy, no older than eight, appeared at our table proffering plates\
  \ of fluffy birthday cake. Wide-eyed, he immediately scampered back to his family\u2019\
  s table without a word.\n\nI took a moment to locate my second \u2018dessert stomach\u2019\
  \ (or was it the third?), before polishing off the cake in all its cream-filled,\
  \ fruit-salad filled glory. I felt a little emotional over the kindness of the gesture,\
  \ to include two strangers in such an exciting day \u2013 I mean, how many times\
  \ in your life do you turn eight? My mind whirred, wondering how we could return\
  \ the gesture. Then it came to me-\n\nSince arriving at our first Night Market in\
  \ Taipei, my partner had been obsessing over \u2018beating\u2019 the balloon shooting\
  \ arcade games to win a toy.  After drooling over stuffed animals for days and taking\
  \ notes on techniques, he had successfully smashed through 3 sets of balloons with\
  \ perfect aim. His spoil of war was a black cat plushie, currently sitting forlornly\
  \ in the car. This cat was the culmination of several days of scheming on his part,\
  \ so I was reluctant to bring up the idea of parting with it.\n\nWhen my partner\
  \ danced out the door and returned, smirking and surreptitiously hiding the cat\
  \ behind his back, I was elated that we were on the same page.\n\nI mentally constructed\
  \ a clipped Birthday greeting in Mandarin- \u201CHappy Birthday, we got you this\
  \ gift.\u201D, then ambled over to the table, practicing it in my mind. I delivered\
  \ my over-laboured sentence and handed over the toy, then I too scampered back to\
  \ our table while surprised eyes followed me. \n\u2018Miao, miao, miao\u2019 filled\
  \ our ears. We shared a smile as we watched the boy and his sister race around the\
  \ tables, with the cat clutched tightly to his chest.\n\nDespite leaving the mountains,\
  \ the pervading warmth and kindness continued- in the face of the elderly lady insisting\
  \ upon delivering us through plant-filled alleys to our AirBnb\u2019s door. In the\
  \ hands of the man pointing out other restaurants in the area as his had just closed.\
  \ In the proud smile of the girl at the cultural park who personally explained the\
  \ differences between the Atayal and Amis peoples. Ren\u2019ai was clearly alive\
  \ and well in the heart of Taiwan."
