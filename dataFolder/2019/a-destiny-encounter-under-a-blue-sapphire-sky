Text: "It happens to all of us to meet a special person during a trip. People with\
  \ kind smiles and bright eyes, that unconsciously comfort and reassure us. Through\
  \ their words, they give us everything we need at that moment. Destiny Encounters,\
  \ I call them.\nI met many people during my travels. I still talk to some of them.\
  \ Never had the chance to meet the others again, the nameless ones that I remember\
  \ more vividly. And with more gratitude.\n\nMy most magical Destiny Encounter happened\
  \ in the blink of an eye. A couple of minutes now crystallized in my memories. I\
  \ was in Porto Venere, a marvellous little town surrounded by a blue sapphire sea.\
  \ I remember the sky was grey, an endless cloud that turned off all the vivid colours.\
  \ The sky was the exact reflection of my soul at that time. A soul tormented by\
  \ a Nameless Darkness I couldn\u2019t tame. Only later, I would have faced that\
  \ Darkness, calling her by her true name: Depression. But at that time, I was just\
  \ a tormented girl in the eyes of many.\n\nMy visit to that little town wasn\u2019\
  t planned. I was with my family to visit the Cinque Terre, enchanting villages nestled\
  \ like jewels between mountain and sea, earth and water. Porto Venere was nearby\
  \ Cinque Terre, less attractive than his popular \u201Csisters\u201D but nonetheless\
  \ more magical, at least to me. I saw it in pictures and I dreamt to walk down its\
  \ little streets, to reach the old church perched on the cliff. My family pleased\
  \ me and decided to take me there.\n\nDestiny Encounters happened when you\u2019\
  re alone, it\u2019s a fact. My parents were eating an ice cream on a bench by the\
  \ sea. And I felt guilty, because I was sad in a beautiful place. I decided to walk\
  \ on the dock for a moment of solitude. Towards its end, where a line of small boats\
  \ peacefully swayed, someone crossed my look. An old man on his moored boat. Every\
  \ wrinkle, a story. He wore simple clothes, faded by sea salt. He had a red beret,\
  \ an intense and vivid colour. His eyes, blue, were a miniature ocean, calm and\
  \ deep.\nHe only needed a gaze to lean on my inner abyss.\n\xABYou\u2019re not from\
  \ here\xBB he spoke with a friendly tone and a beautiful smile that lit up his eyes.\n\
  \xABNo\xBB I answered, \xABI\u2019m on holiday.\xBB\n\xABAnd are you having fun?\xBB\
  \ the fishermen asked.\n\xABI try.\xBB\n\xABDon\u2019t try it\xBB he told me. My\
  \ right eyebrow started to lift up, showing my incredulity. \xABDon\u2019t try to\
  \ be happy. Just be it. Life is beautiful, and we\u2019re so lucky to live another\
  \ day under this beautiful sun.\xBB\n\xABThere\u2019s no sun\xBB I replied, hiding\
  \ my true feelings with indifference and sarcasm.\n\xABNo, but it will be soon.\
  \ Clouds don\u2019t last forever. The sun, that never disappears. It\u2019s simply\
  \ covered every now and then.\xBB\nI nodded, not knowing how to talk back cynically.\
  \ I didn\u2019t ask him anything, nor if he had known my same darkness in the past,\
  \ nor his name. He read my soul so easily and I still don't understand how he did\
  \ it. But maybe I overthink it. Maybe he only saw a sad girl walking down the dock,\
  \ and he decided to cheer me up.\nOr maybe not.\n\xABHave some fun and try to always\
  \ smile. When you smile, everything became more bearable.\xBB\n\xABI\u2019ll try\
  \ it. Have a good day.\xBB I smiled to him, a sincere smile. The first of the day.\n\
  \nI left, comforted and heartened. I turned around to furtively look at him, but\
  \ he had already moved on with his peaceful life, fiddling with fishing nets. I\
  \ kept on walking down the dock. And, suddenly, I saw it: an intense, vivid blue\
  \ sea, so beautiful to hurt the eyes. Small pearl and sand coloured boats moored.\
  \ Pastel pink, green and yellow houses, with flowers on the balconies. My parents\
  \ on the bench, with a big, delicious ice-cream. They looked at me, smiling. An\
  \ act of love that for too long I didn\u2019t reciprocate. I smiled back.\n\nAnd\
  \ the sun peeked out from the clouds, revealing a blue sapphire sky."
