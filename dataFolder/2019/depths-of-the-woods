Text: "Went on a expedition alone, to only find I wasn\u2019t alone. To far places\
  \ I went looking for answers amongst the woods, river and the mountains. Little\
  \ answers did I find but saw a whole new realm of possibilities. \n\nThe Jim Corbett\
  \ national park in Uttarakhand is a stunner in terms of scenery and serenity. A\
  \ day in this place and you\u2019ll fall in love with its scenic beauty and multicultural\
  \ people. It does have many recreational activities in terms of safari, resorts\
  \ etc. The wild wind will drive away all your insecurities if you choose to give\
  \ in to the nature around. The chilled evenings and the hot days would probably\
  \ be too much to handle, but nevertheless time spent there is time never got back.\
  \          \n\nAt times you might get so lost in time, sitting by the shores that\
  \ the sunset itself would seem so bright amongst the million emerging stars. \n\n\
  The first day I reached resort tarangi, I was blown away by the beauty of its landscape.\
  \ Later met many like minded people as purpose for going there was a art+design\
  \ festival. It was a day long journey in the bus, hence there was just a brief introduction\
  \ to the festival and then we all just crashed. \n\nThe second day was when the\
  \ events begun. The kind of possibilities of a person exploring new things or ideas\
  \ here were endless. One could attend any workshop that interested them and interact\
  \ with anyone they chose to with no hesitation. The kind of atmosphere built was\
  \ unimaginably humbling and energetic. Every person for themselves was no more a\
  \ concept we followed, every stranger turned a friend. The day continued with engaging\
  \ talks and intuiting workshops all along. \n\nOn day three we were all very upset\
  \ that this journey were to come to an end so soon. We had all got aquatinted to\
  \ the idea of being in such a safe space and totally being your self without being\
  \ judged for it that the thought of going back was not a pleasant one. However,\
  \ we got through the day with more exciting workshops about managing emotions, making\
  \ mandalas and candles. It was an emotional day for everyone as the thought of being\
  \ oneself had grown on us all. The night was very eventful with intellectual  conversations\
  \ happening all around and concert night with some of the country\u2019s best music\
  \ being played live. Some people spent their time discussing ideas, some danced,\
  \ some slept but me; I just sat by the river trying to absorb it all in - the air,\
  \ music, river and the words I heard from the universe itself. So I wrote down a\
  \ few poems, which I haven\u2019t yet read in fear of what truth they hold about\
  \ the emotions I\u2019ve bottled up. Not a fear but just anxious about reading something\
  \ I wish I hadn\u2019t. But the day ended with some psycho trance music in the bedroom.\
  \ \n\nThe very last day was when we had a very brief list of events lined up as\
  \ we had to leave by 12. The one event I was glad I went to was the blinded folded\
  \ conversations. It was as simple as it sounds, you are blindfolded and made to\
  \ sit with a person you haven\u2019t seen and asked to share experiences of life.\
  \ The pure truth at this moment is almost surreal because I opened up about the\
  \ most deeply buried secret I had in my life. This moment made all the time in the\
  \ hot sun worth it. The kind of atmosphere, people and everything else conspired\
  \ together to help me release that emotion amongst those woods in that place and\
  \ there it will stay forever. \nLater, we got a very long journey towards the airport.\
  \ But it was eventful as well as we had some live music being played in the bus\
  \ by a few budding singers. \nBut I would like to conclude by saying, this trip\
  \ really opened my eyes to a world I refused to believe existed. A leap into the\
  \ unknown I took, a direction I found."
