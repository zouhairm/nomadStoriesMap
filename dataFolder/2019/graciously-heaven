Text: "Its here, Its here.welcome to graciously heaven on earth,I could write a story\
  \ choosing any conutry,but I would like to share my story of this beautiful heaven,which\
  \ exist in India.I am a solo traveller & have been to couple of countries but sharing\
  \ a story about my own country,would be more exiting then any other. So here we\
  \ go,Some one has once said that if there is any heaven on earth then it is in Kashmir,which\
  \ is a state in northern India, often denoted by its acronym. It is located mostly\
  \ in the Himalayan mountains & shares borders with the states of Himachal Pradesh\
  \ and Punjab to the south. The beauty of this place can easily enchant the mind\
  \ of any individual,its the place .\_Where beauty knows no bounds, where heart knows\
  \ no worries, Kashmir, the name says it all. The land where every step makes you\
  \ feel closer to heaven.\nI noticed  some magical things,whenever I saw snow fall,I\
  \ love snow for the some reasons : It brings people together while time stands still.\
  \ \nCozy couples lazily meandered the streets and children trudged sleds and chased\
  \ snowballs. \nNo one seemed to be in a rush to experience anything other than the\
  \ glory of the day, with each other, whenever and however it happened.\nI started\
  \ my 1st day  with Soanamarg, which means 'meadow of gold' has, as its backdrop,\
  \ snowy mountains against a cerulean sky. The Sindh meanders along here and abounds\
  \ with trout and mahseer, snow trout can be caught in the main river. it is not\
  \ difficult to lose track of time being lost in the scenery of Nature's artistry.\n\
  \ Next day, I drove to Gulmarg,Where taking a Gondola ride is a must. Reckoned to\
  \ be world\u2019s second highest cable car project,Gondola is two-tiered ride. In\
  \ the first phase, the visitors are taken to Kongdori, which is situated at a height\
  \ of 2600m; &  in the second phase, I was taken to an elevation of 3747m at Aparwath\
  \ Peak & to see this place from cable car is another experience. \nImagine riding\
  \ on an aerial cable car that provides panoramic views of snow-covered valleys and\
  \ Yes, sking down those slopes was my another,first life experience!  Sking is one\
  \ of the main adventurous sport attraction in Kashmir. During winters Gulmarg offers\
  \ perfect gentle slopes,it gives you an opportunity to indulge in winter sports\
  \ activities. \nLush green mountains of Gulmarg are transformed from a sleepy agricultural\
  \ town to a winter wonderland and These are the moments when I cherish silence at\
  \ most or Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I feel that silence enhances the experience.\
  \ Words can be spoken Afterwards. \nHave you ever felt,a fairy tale ride in the\
  \ heaven ? Yes I have experienced it in real,when I visited Pagalagam in Kashmir,\
  \ Pahalgam is a hill station in the north Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Mountain\
  \ trails run northeast to Amarnath Cave Temple, a Hindu shrine and site of the annual\
  \ Amarnath Yatra pilgrimage. It was an another beautiful experience to heaven,when\
  \ I took a pony ride to above in the mountain and experienced the whole universe\
  \ around me.Baisaran, situated 5 km away from Pehalgam,is a lush meadow enveloped\
  \ with dense vegetation. The meadow is dotted with thickly wooded forests of pine,\
  \ & provides a view of the beautiful snow-clad mountains that surround it from all\
  \ sides.\nI hv not Been to Switzerland but this place beats it for sure !!So much\
  \ more beautiful and breathtaking. Just awesome!! \nAfter two days,I returned back\
  \ to Srinagar,which is the largest city and the summer capital of the Indian state\
  \ of Jammu and Kashmir. It lies in the Kashmir Valley on the banks of the Jhelum\
  \ River, a tributary of the Indus, and Dal and Anchar lakes. The city is known for\
  \ its natural environment, gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. I stayed here for\
  \ 4nights and explored around and noticed how nice to see all kashmiri enjoying\
  \ the sun.What can I say about local people,the amount of love and warmth they have\
  \ for people is unreal.\nI\u2019hv had so many experience here, that left me in\
  \ awe.10days in kashmir were so overwhelming.these days were full of feeling so\
  \ many emotions,that will be cherish forever in my travel diary."
