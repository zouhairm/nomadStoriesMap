Text: "In 2014 I found myself wandering around Portland, Oregon feeling rather directionless\
  \ and lonely. This was the 6th city I had called home in as many years. I was 26\
  \ and living what I felt was a rather non-conventional mess of a life. I suppose\
  \ this outlook came from some wonderfully limiting cultural expectations. I didn\u2019\
  t feel particularly ashamed or disappointed with my decisions. But I didn\u2019\
  t know what to do next. I went to college (three, in fact), I worked with AmeriCorps\
  \ for a year, and I dabbled in the sector of non-profit work. But I had also developed\
  \ a fear of permanence, or maybe just a strong aversion to it, and this prevented\
  \ me from wanting to invest in any kind of career.\n\nIt was a chilly evening in\
  \ January when I reconnected with an old high school friend at a bar in Southeast\
  \ Portland. With one quick whisper of adventure, she sent me spinning wildly in\
  \ a rather dramatic direction. She had been to Antarctica. She had worked in Antarctica.\
  \ She had had the time of her life in Antarctica. And now I wanted to go to Antarctica.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t this first conversation that sold me on the possibility. A week\
  \ later this friend took me to a screening of a documentary called \u201CAntarctica:\
  \ A Year on Ice\u201D about living and working on the frozen continent. It was newly\
  \ released and touring the country. It wasn\u2019t the movie itself that captured\
  \ my interest, it was the people at the screening. There was this community of \u201C\
  ice people\u201D who had some kind of deep and incredible bond that I couldn\u2019\
  t understand as an outsider. But I was fascinated. I wanted to be a part of it.\
  \ \n\nI applied for and was offered a job as a Steward for the summer season (October-February)\
  \ 2014/15. The extent of my knowledge regarding what was about to happen was limited\
  \ to a job description and a smattering of photos I could find online of McMurdo.\
  \ My friend shared her stories and packing tips, but there\u2019s really no way\
  \ to prepare someone for McMurdo. Because what I later learned is that, everyone\
  \ is going to have a wildly different yet equally grand experience there. I was\
  \ both terrified and thrilled for the adventure. But there\u2019s no way I could\
  \ have comprehended how thoroughly this adventure would impact my life. \n\nI remember\
  \ feeling so lonely that first day. I was literally lost coming back from the laundry\
  \ room where I went to find a pillow for my bed. I remember the social anxiety I\
  \ had in the galley, not knowing where to sit and eat dinner. I remember feeling\
  \ overwhelmed by learning a new job. But in my first full day, I met some of the\
  \ best friends I\u2019ve ever had. And they were just the beginning. I continued\
  \ to meet more and more people who I could connect with on a level I hadn\u2019\
  t found before. My \u201Cnon-conventional mess of a life\u201D\u2026 it belonged\
  \ to everybody here. You don\u2019t lead a conventional life and end up in Antarctica.\
  \ People didn\u2019t ask me where I was from, they asked me where my stuff was.\
  \ They asked me where I was going to travel when I left the ice. These were my people.\
  \ I found them at the bottom of the world, on an island for misfit toys. They are\
  \ adventurers who set out in search of some greater understanding of the world and\
  \ the people in it while breaking away from the standards of a society that limits\
  \ us to one place, one job, or one path. \n\nI\u2019ve now been returning to Antarctica\
  \ seasonally for five years. After that first season, I found a better job on station,\
  \ a job I truly love. I\u2019ve also met people who inspire me, who travel with\
  \ me, who challenge me, who pick me up when I\u2019m down. I\u2019ve traveled around\
  \ the world and seen and experienced more than I ever thought was possible. I\u2019\
  m no longer afraid of not knowing what to do with my life. I\u2019m okay with wandering,\
  \ with being lost. As it turns out, getting lost has been the best thing I\u2019\
  ve ever done."
