Text: "My story is about my Erasmus experience in Porto. Honestly, I think that all\
  \ of the thee themes are appropriate for my story.\nMy best friend and I decided\
  \ to live on our own for 5 months in a country we have never been and we didn\u2019\
  t even know the language.\nIt was a scary decision, but we made the most of it.\
  \ In the time living in Porto, we learned how to take care of ourselves (it was\
  \ the first time for the both of us living without our parents). I met so many amazing\
  \ people who taught me patience, new forms of love, acceptance to different people\
  \ and even how to travel on my own. \nI fell in love with the small city, even with\
  \ the things I didn\u2019t like at all, for example all the hills and the wind.\
  \ At least I got into shape, at the end, it wasn\u2019t a problem at all to walk\
  \ 15 minutes uphill.  Being back home, I miss the colorful houses, the spirit of\
  \ the city in which you can go for a cheap beer at any moment of the day. Porto\
  \ really is a place where anybody can find something for themselves - a party almost\
  \ every day, surfing or just walking on the beach, going to see a museum to a park\
  \ or just meeting a friend, everything is so close by.\nThe thing that I had most\
  \ problems with is the Portuguese way of never being on time. My mother taught me\
  \ to never be late, so I was annoyed with this for the first few months, but I got\
  \ with their culture and my new \u2018being on time\u2019 was always 15 minutes\
  \ late - that\u2019s how the Portuguese do it. Having said what I disliked the most,\
  \ I have to mention the two things I adored. The first one is their custom of going\
  \ to see the sunset. Since Porto is one big hill, it has some special places where\
  \ you can see the most beautiful sunsets. And it\u2019s not even just about seeing\
  \ the sun go down. You meet with friends, take a beer and just hang out, talk, laugh.\
  \ It\u2019s a way of getting closer to each other, to take an hour of your busy\
  \ day and relax with people you love with an amazing view. \nThe other thing that\
  \ stuck with me is their way of saying hello and goodbye - two kisses on the cheek.\
  \ Coming from a \u2018hand-shaking\u2019 culture, it was strange at first, but as\
  \ time passed, it really grew on me. Portuguese people are known to be very emotional\
  \ and I believe that it really does show here. The kisses go into your personal\
  \ space so I think this brings people a bit closer together. In Slovenia, where\
  \ I\u2019m from, we hug the people we\u2019re really close to, to others we simply\
  \ say goodbye.\nI unexpectedly fell in love with the language. I had Spanish in\
  \ high school, so I taught that Portuguese is really similar to it. Maybe in writing\
  \ but in speaking it\u2019s a whole different language. I call it the ugly sister\
  \ of Spanish. I have to admit, I hated Portuguese, it sounds like a person is choking.\
  \ But as I learned more of it, I noticed myself preferring Portuguese. The grammar\
  \ use is very interesting and different from Spanish. And although I still think\
  \ it sounds like someone choking, I love it, it makes me laugh hearing a native\
  \ speaker talk.\nErasmus exchange is officially a school program, but I learned\
  \ so many valuable lessons for life that the University back home could never give\
  \ to me.\nI guess I could say that I leaped into the unknown and never expected\
  \ to make such a strong local connection."
