Text: "March 11/12, 2016\n                    The unbelievable trip\nAbdullah bin\
  \ Abdulaziz, Ibrahim Albutairi, and I decided to go on a beautiful holiday trip\
  \ to Dubai and it all started here. \nWe went to some offices in Saudi Arabia and\
  \ asked about the tickets prices and they said each 1010 SAR and at the that time\
  \ I called Ahmed Abdulrahman (my cousin in Kuwait) to get us three tickets from\
  \ Kuwait and he said each 550 SAR in that case we chose the second plan which is\
  \ driving to Kuwait then fly from there to Dubai.\nMe and Abdullah bin Abdulaziz,\
  \ decided to take a rental car so we can travel to Kuwait due to the fact that his\
  \ dad's car needs to be repaired. So my brother Abdullah helped us rent a car on\
  \ his name, anyway we started driving all the way up to Kuwait and we were caught\
  \ by a radar twice in which costed us to pay for the fines 600 SAR. whilst we were\
  \ driving, the car seemed to be running out of gas and there was no ATM to withdraw\
  \ cash in all gas stations or either not working ones. We stopped in a gas station\
  \ with a disparate looks on our faces, I was trying to sell my new shirt in order\
  \ to get some cash so we can fill our car, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz was chatting with\
  \ Ibrahim my cousin and told him this story and Ibrahim came up with the greatest\
  \ idea ever to get us liquidated with some cash, \"I will be going to supermarket\
  \ to get 50 SAR STC and you sell it to the gas station\" Ibrahim said. We were so\
  \ happy that even the gas station accepted this offer. Ibrahim did so and the gas\
  \ station gave us 50SAR we put gas 30 SAR. And the rest bought some groceries for\
  \ us. Before we arrived the gas again went low. So we called Ibrahim again to do\
  \ exactly the same thing. But instead he gave us the voucher amount of 50 SAR STC.\
  \ The gas station told us that he's a mobily user and we started talking to customers\
  \ but none of them wanted that because almost all of them use postponed plan for\
  \ calling. Anyway someone donated us with 20\uFDFC gas and we were very thankful\
  \ for that. We arrived to the niwaiseb and called Ibrahim Albutairi to come and\
  \ get us to enter Kuwait and his reply was utterly ridiculous. \"I'm very tired\"\
  \ he said. At the end we were trying to catch anyone to help us go through and we\
  \ were like Mexicans. Lol. A man tried to help us but couldn't do anything. \nWe\
  \ eventually crossed the border by walkijg which was very strange. I filmed that\
  \ but it was deleted due to formation of the phone. \nMy cousin Ahmed Abdulrahman\
  \ came to pick us from the beginning of highway of Kuwait, we caught our flight\
  \ on time we almost missed it. When we are returning from Dubai to Kuwait, we missed\
  \ the flight and I personally missed two flights. \n\nUnfinished...."
