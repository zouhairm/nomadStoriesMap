Text: "A young woman sat cross-legged in the dimly lit hallway cooking aushak, a leek\
  \ and scallion-filled dumpling. Dozens of them, uncooked, lined a silver-colored\
  \ tray next to her on the hard, concrete floor. The sound of the boiling water was\
  \ hard to hear over the noisy women walking by who gave her only a brief glance\
  \ to avoid stumbling over the large cauldron. My stomach grumbled; I was hungry,\
  \ but lunch with the warden of the Kabul Women\u2019s Prison was still an hour away.\
  \ \n\nThis wasn\u2019t a typical prison, at least not by American standards. The\
  \ women at this prison weren\u2019t particularly violent or criminal. They were\
  \ mostly prisoners of \u201Cmoral crimes,\u201D or zina.  Having a boyfriend, out-of-wedlock\
  \ babies, running away from forced marriages and domestic abuse are all considered\
  \ criminal offenses in Afghanistan. This was my third visit to Kabul, and I was\
  \ constantly reminded of a woman\u2019s role in society, or lack thereof, since\
  \ the rise and not-quite-fall of the Taliban.   \n\nThe interpreter guided us past\
  \ the woman cooking and into the next cell, which was more of a large room with\
  \ bunk beds lining each wall. Eight women called that cell home for the duration\
  \ of their prison sentence. Unlike the hallway outside, this floor was layered with\
  \ brightly-colored, mismatched woven rugs. Colorful scarves and other fabrics adorned\
  \ the plain walls giving the otherwise cold and impersonal room some warmth on that\
  \ morning. \n\nTo create privacy where there was none, the women had hung blankets\
  \ as makeshift curtains in front of each of their beds. A young child peeked out\
  \ from behind one of the curtains and watched us, a playful smirk on her little\
  \ face. An adult arm, covered in gold bangles that jingled with each movement, reached\
  \ across the child\xB4s belly and pulled her gently behind the curtain, letting\
  \ it fall back into place.\n\nSome of the women were grouped around an old television\
  \ in one corner of the cell casually watching something that resembled an Afghan\
  \ soap opera; others were talking to each other across the room from their beds.\
  \ The women nervously glanced at us as we entered and a couple of them retreated\
  \ behind their curtains. \n\nShe, however, stood proudly at the back of the cell\
  \ looking out across the busy prison yard through the window. Compared to the other\
  \ women in their dull prison garb, she was dressed in the most vibrant attire I\
  \ had seen all day. Half-turned to me, I saw the orange-brown henna stains on her\
  \ hands. They were fresh. Her emerald green and deep magenta headscarf was embellished\
  \ with intricate, golden embroidery and delicate beading. She even wore light red\
  \ lipstick.\n\nI joined her at the window and motioned for the interpreter to come\
  \ closer. \n\n\u201CThat\u2019s a beautiful dress,\u201D I said. \n\nShe smoothed\
  \ the front of her royal blue and magenta satin skirt and turned towards me. \u201C\
  Thank you. I\u2019m getting married today!\u201D \n\n\u201CThen why are you here?\u201D\
  \ I asked, although I could have probably guessed.\n\nShe smiled softly at me. \u201C\
  I had a boyfriend, and our families did not approve of us being together.\u201D\
  \ She lowered her voice, and I leaned closer into her secret. \u201CWhen they found\
  \ out about our relationship, I was arrested. I dishonored my family and brought\
  \ shame upon them.\u201D \n\nShe nervously adjusted her headscarf and flashed me\
  \ another shy, but happy, smile. \u201CBut our families finally gave their consent.\
  \ His mother is coming to meet me today, and then we will get married! Isn\u2019\
  t that wonderful?\u201D she asked, raising her hazel eyes to meet mine.\n\nAnd,\
  \ in that moment, it was wonderful. She was getting out of this prison for a crime\
  \ that, in my country, was not a crime at all. How many more like her were in this\
  \ place? How many more were to come?\n\n\u201CYou are a beautiful bride,\u201D I\
  \ said as I took her henna-stained hands and squeezed gently.  \u201CMay you have\
  \ a long and happy marriage.\u201D \n\nThe interpreter led us out of the cell; it\
  \ was time for lunch with the prison warden.  In her private dining room, the silver-colored\
  \ tray caught my eye. \n\nIt was filled with freshly cooked aushak."
