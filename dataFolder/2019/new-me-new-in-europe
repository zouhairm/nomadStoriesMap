Text: "Everything started with an application in my university of origin in Lima to\
  \ do an exchange program of the faculty of business sciences. I was scared because\
  \ I didn\xB4t know what could happen in the proccess of my application, but I think\
  \ the scary things are the most exciting things that could happen to a student of\
  \ 22-age. My mom told me a phrase that I could not ever forget: \"Take the risk,\
  \ life is one\". And that\xB4s the beginning of the experience of my exchange life\
  \ that I could not explain in one word. Being a exchange student is the first step\
  \ to become a new person, but a better person. It\xB4s you in a new world, you have\
  \ to learn how to fight with this new world, you are alone, out of your confort\
  \ zone, but you know that you can do it, because you learn how to trust in you and\
  \ get a solution for all the obstacles that you get during your new exchange lifestyle.\
  \ The first day at Santiago de Compostela in Spain was incredible, I was ready to\
  \ meet new people and have new friends, nowadays I can say that each person that\
  \ I met in Spain, took a part of my heart so, I feel like my heart is around the\
  \ world: Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Italy and more cities. As an international student,\
  \ I had de opportunity to visit more countries, one of them was Portugal. It was\
  \ the best country for me with his cities like Lisbon, Oporto and Fatima. I was\
  \ there for three times and Portugal made me feel like I was in home. The food and\
  \ the people are so incredible, I miss a lot \"Pastel de Nata\". So delicious! Portugal\
  \ is near to Santiago de Compostela so I was in Portugal for three times. But regarding\
  \ about Spain, my experience there permitted me to become an other person, I feel\
  \ more independent, more mature and ready to take new experiences, new adventures.\
  \ It was difficult to say goodbye to my lifestyle in Spain, but more difficult to\
  \ say goodbye to an special person that I met there. He is from Germany and our\
  \ relationship was difficult because we couldn\xB4t says each other about our feelings,\
  \ so it\xB4s like my heart is in Europe because he is there. Nowadays, we continue\
  \ talking but we are afraid about the feelings and that was the difficult goodbye\
  \ in Spain. This experience makes me believe that life is one and you have to take\
  \ the risk and show what do you feel, without afraid. You have to take advantage\
  \ of the opportunity, dont leave it gone. Love, life and travel."
