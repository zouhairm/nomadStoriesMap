Text: "I sat in the back of the truck, tucked away in the left corner with my knees\
  \ to my chest.  I sat across from our Bosnian tour guide, an expert Norwegian hiker,\
  \ a Swedish expat, and to my right was my American co-intern. The anticipation ate\
  \ at me as I tried to focus on the conversation of my hike mates. We talked of love\
  \ across cultures, health, and Eastern European history. About a month before, I\
  \ received an email from an Australian expat living in Serbia who organized different\
  \ trips to immerse other expats in Eastern European culture. The email advertised\
  \ hiking from the Magli\u0107 Mountain top in Bosnia and Herzegovina to Lake Trnova\u010D\
  ko, a glacier lake in Montenegro. Being from Florida, I had never hiked a day in\
  \ my life. Two hours driving to Sutjeska National Park and arriving at Magli\u0107\
  \ Mountain top changed that. I leapt into the unknown that weekend in a land far\
  \ from home with complete strangers.\n\n          The view from Magli\u0107 had\
  \ three stunning elements. The first was the light green grass, sprinkled with yellow\
  \ and white weed flowers. The second element was a thick row of trees that dipped\
  \ in the middle, each a different size and shade of green. The third was the mountains,\
  \ which faded into the distance. We embarked down the side of the mountain on a\
  \ gravel trail. The trail was lined with different color flowers and mountain mint.\
  \ We descended into the valley, passing the Regionalni Park Piva sign, the border\
  \ into Montenegro. \n\n          As we hiked up the side of the mountain, the hike\
  \ grew harder. The area was filled with tall thin trees. I began to fall behind,\
  \ eventually, significantly behind. The snow had melted creating a slippery wet\
  \ trail. My shoes and ankles were caked with mud. I breathed heavier and heavier\
  \ with every step. However, I was determined to make it to the glacier lake. My\
  \ fellow hikers swapped stories about their hiking experiences; I wanted to share\
  \ this experience with my future hike mates. \n\n          After 45 minutes of embarrassment\
  \ and life talks with Alek, a Serbian who described life during the Balkan Wars,\
  \ I had arrived at the glacier lake. It was my first time gazing at this type of\
  \ scenery. There was a calmness that surrounded the lake. The lush foliage and snow-topped\
  \ mountains engulfed their onlookers in their calmness. I began to sprint towards\
  \ my peers. The group sat on this makeshift bench made from a fallen down tree.\
  \ I was confused because they were sitting. There were only two people swimming\
  \ in the lake. \u201CNo one is going in?\u201D I asked; they shook their heads no,\
  \ stating it was \u201Ctoo cold\u201D. I ripped off my clothes, gingerly walked\
  \ towards the shore, and dove into the glacier lake. The lake was ice cold and stung\
  \ my body, but at the same time invigorated me. The water was clear enough to see\
  \ my knees. I never felt more alive and I wanted my peers to feel the same. I swished\
  \ around in one swift motion and shouted to the group \u201Cwhen are you ever going\
  \ to do the exact same thing, at the exact same time, with the exact same people?\u201D\
  . A mass exodus of my hiking peers walked toward the lake, dressing into their bathing\
  \ suits. One by one, they experienced that exact same invigorating feeling of excitement\
  \ and awe. We swam for an hour and shared stories of our hometowns in Costa Rica,\
  \ Colombia, Australia, and America.\n\n          That was my first time hiking and\
  \ swimming in a glacier lake. I was fortunate enough to have this experience in\
  \ the beautiful countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro with new friends.\
  \ That day forever changed my life in the sense of pushing personal boundaries and\
  \ immersing myself into the countries I had long studied before. I had the opportunity\
  \ to speak with Serbian and Bosnian locals who spoke proudly of their past, culture,\
  \ and future, as well as individuals from all over the world. My passion and fondness\
  \ for Eastern Europe flourished that day. I found a new passion because I pushed\
  \ my personal boundaries and leapt into the unknown."
