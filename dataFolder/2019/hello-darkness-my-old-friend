Text: "Uluru. That's its new old name. White settlers came along and gave it a different\
  \ moniker but Ayers Rock now enjoys its Aboriginal title once more. I have camped\
  \ out on the sand of tropical beaches, I've scaled that huge sand dune on the French\
  \ coast, I have wandered through the sparse sandy terrain of the Joshua Tree national\
  \ park, but nothing had prepared me for the glory, the wonder, the inspiration of\
  \ that giant ant-hill, that terreplein, that glowing mound of sand in the heart\
  \ of the Australian continent. \nAustralians handle tourism well. They don't overload\
  \ their natural wonders, of which there are almost too many to note. The Reef, the\
  \ Rainforest, the Rock: you don't go down to Australia and not visit that triumvirate\
  \ of antipodean peculiarities.\nI saw them all, gently guided by a tourist industry\
  \ which curtails visitor numbers and imposes strict restrictions in an attempt to\
  \ slow the dying of the Reef, the shrinking of the Rainforest and the desecration\
  \ of the Rock.\nThey are all beautiful in that intense, striking interpretation\
  \ of the word. I couldn't choose which, for me, would define Australia. \nBut, when\
  \ I close my eyes and let myself drift backwards to that particular holiday I remember\
  \ the Darkness and I hear the Sounds of Silence.\nI don't know whose idea it was\
  \ to offer a dinner by candlelight in the central heart of the Australian desert\
  \ but it was indeed inspired. It was a celebration of Australia of which Ned Kelly\
  \ would have been proud. \nAs the sun began its mesmerising descent to the horizon\
  \ we were shuttled from the Ayers Rock Resort towards our pop-up dining destination,\
  \ a vantage point from which we could see the Rock in all its kaleidoscopic glory.\
  \ \nWith the descent of darkness the haunting whooping of a lone didgeridoo sent\
  \ its deep bass vibrations through our little camp as we felt our way between the\
  \ tables, laid sumptuously with linen and candlesticks, towards the bush tucker\
  \ barbie where the headline acts were crocodile, kangaroo and, rather incongruously\
  \ given our distance from the sea, barramundi, with unknown and unpronounceable\
  \ local flora in the supporting cast, and the wine on offer a tribute to Australia's\
  \ finest vineyards.\nEven the requisite visit to the remarkably clean eco-dunny\
  \ became an adventure as our eyes, accustomed only to the candlelight, suddenly\
  \ had to adjust to the almost complete darkness on the fringes of our makeshift\
  \ restaurant.  \nAnd then, the real beauty, Nature's own wonder: the desert night\
  \ sky. Candles extinguished and torches turned low we sat around the campfire and,\
  \ looked up into the bejewelled velvet canopy above us, listening and learning as\
  \ planets, constellations and supernovae were all given life, their position revealed,\
  \ their history explained and their beauty, through knowledge, magnified.\nI have\
  \ so many memories of our trip to that Land Down Under and it is the feelings, not\
  \ the photos, that reignite the experience. \nGo! Feel it for yourself! \nBut make\
  \ sure you travel to the heart of that vast land; make sure you watch the colours\
  \ as the sun sets and rises again and again on the real Rock of Ages and make sure\
  \ you travel out into the darkness and listen to the hypnotic Sounds of Silence."
