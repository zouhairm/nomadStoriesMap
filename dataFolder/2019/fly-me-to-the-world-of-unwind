Text: "I hit my rock bottom and the only way is to go up. If I wanted to share what\
  \ happened in the past, I would been crying and dwelling with my sadness. But life\
  \ goes on and I\u2019ve moved on. I have been a better me and frankly speaking I\
  \ am not that strong but what else should I do when to be strong is the only option.\
  \ I found peace with globetrotting telling myself there\u2019s no right or wrong.Things\
  \ that might be wrong for us to practice all this while might be right on the other\
  \ side of the world, vice versa. I started to travel when I was just 20 years old.\
  \ Being raised in typical Asian\u2019s family, to escape alone wandering in other\
  \ side of the world is not even in my dream. Only when I became a flight attendant\
  \ then I realised, there\u2019s much more of the world outside from what I know\
  \ all this while. I did not stop there. That was my kickstarting journey to the\
  \ world of the unwind. Summer breeze, autumn leaves, winter freeze and spring kiss,\
  \ every occasion gives me a different joy every time. I always wanted to visit historical\
  \ country before. Italy, Russia, Germany and Greece. So far I\u2019ve been to all\
  \ but this is a story of Greece, a country of spartans and ancients, orange and\
  \ fascinating islands that is overlooking magnificent Caldera view. I went to Acropolis\
  \ site just to reminisce the slavery days back then in Athens and to learn more\
  \ on Ottoman empire. It was stunning and similar with pyramids, I was wondering\
  \ how come the ancient people have the strength to build such a beautiful architecture\
  \ which is still remain intact whereby during that period of time there\u2019s no\
  \ technology at all. The marble flooring, the arch and the pillars, the ancient\
  \ people were extremely gifted by the God. It is beautiful and it was like a heaven\
  \ on earth might be on that period of time. I belief history teaches us to be a\
  \ better human each and every day. The further you walk, the more knowledge that\
  \ you will earn along the way. I am blissfully blessed for all the journey that\
  \ taught me how to be strong. The experiences made me realised how tiny is my problems\
  \ are compared to others. Greece is one of my favourite place to visit. The souvlaki,\
  \ greek\u2019s must try dish is appetising, finger licking good! The streetwalk\
  \ at plaka and anafioka is super romantic and how I wish my love ones should tag\
  \ along during the trip. I was there during the winter season and I can\u2019t imagine\
  \ if the flowers start blooming, how pretty it would be during spring season. This\
  \ is my Greece-perience, a memory that i would never forget for the rest of my life."
