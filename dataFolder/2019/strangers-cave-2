Text: "My trip to sriLanka was very unique, not just regular trip this because I was\
  \ exploring the first human born semiconductor and Balangoda man was actually why\
  \ place a strange effect on the human psyche there but not only human per effort\
  \ of mixing egg cell with sperm never feel with a sense of how human nature how\
  \ it is begin And why we are humans\n Colombo, Thursday morning at 9 am, it was\
  \ the first step to access Asia, not really knowing why they picked the country's\
  \ capital Colombo? The first colonialism of imperialism Portugal named it Ceilao\
  \ Island so show the meaning of this island and its history and gain a wide recognition\
  \ and civilization and its wars against colonialism and its wish to be a free, independent\
  \ country \n We were a team of 16 people from 10 nationalities of the world hugged\
  \ us SriLanka to explore their nature\nWe Visited 7 cities I saw at them the coolest\
  \ the eye of cosmic and human nature and beauty of the island the Greek name tabrobani\
  \ as stated in their book Ptolomaei alexandrine\n\nAs an Arabian Muslim girl it\
  \ was my first time to see other religions are Christian and Jewish so I discovered\
  \ others beliefs in Asia and this was the most enjoyable events I have ever had,\
  \ in srilanka everything big or small has a different meaning, such as a Buddha\
  \ statue, sleeping or sitting or without food for 7 years or symbols and sings of\
  \ animals on Hindu temples,Even inside my team was different religions and nationalities\
  \ and different culture, but we have learned from each other every thing about this\
  \ makes dialogue in a house that all of us tougher in a small county in Asia \n\
  I can\u2019t forget our funny games, which we taught there also the food there I\
  \ tasted 11 kind of food such as spicy Sri Lankan food and curry rice and rottee,\
  \ and another multinational food which made srilanka as far as the cave of visiting\
  \ in order to discover all that is strange.\n\n\n In a tea factory small worker\
  \ her costume very simple in the most beautiful landscapes where the plains and\
  \ highlands low or high, covered with tea leaves embraced by a small lack as a painting\
  \ \nThis lady was working passionately and joyfully as the manger of this paradise\
  \ then we knew that her salary is less than the price of a lunch meal so that we\
  \ realized the secret of the people of srilanka is the place where they live ,they\
  \ really satisfied with emotional happiness \n\nWe took the best train in the world\
  \ ever to see Ella, this warm city with their citizen even the weather is cold\n\
  On the tops of mountains cute girl called arena live with her grandmother only and\
  \ doing a little project to host people to make them happy only for happiness.\n\
  The first day in Ella I waked up on Sri Lankan milk tea with cinnamon pie in the\
  \ highest place you can show a natural, Ella rock I felt that I am in origin of\
  \ paradise but in a shape of srilanka.\nat the end of my journey I need to discover\
  \ the human origins and explore the cosmic nature and know about the  meaning of\
  \ state in every county all over the world to get rid of puzzlement and ignorance.\n\
  \ so for sure no one will live in the cave of strangers as long as we see and search."
