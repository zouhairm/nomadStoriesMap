Text: "Rio de Janeiro is a flat city and this is my favorite feature for tourism.\
  \ Please let me explain.\nMost people travel for vacation and we should not get\
  \ too tired when we are trying to get rest for the daily stress. \nA vacation should\
  \ be fun and invigorating. Few days for yourself to connect with new stories, inspiring\
  \ landscape, nice food and some treats, right?\n\nWhen you think about resting you\u2019\
  ll probably imagine a beautiful beach with a colorful drink and a massage spa but\
  \ it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. You can enjoy a nice vacation in the city.\n\
  In Rio de Janeiro\u2019s case you can enjoy both scenarios. \n\nRio, as the locals\
  \ call it, is the second biggest city of Brazil, which was a Portuguese cologne\
  \ for almost 300 years.  \nThe city was designed to be Paris in South America so\
  \ when you are walking in downtown you can enjoy a lot of Art Nouveau preserved\
  \ architecture between tall ugly buildings and decadent facades. \n\nFor me, the\
  \ real essence of a city is between a famous tourist spot and another. It is on\
  \ the streets that you are able to observe the daily architecture, the simple restaurants,\
  \ the informal workers, the city alive, breathing - sometimes yelling; and that\u2019\
  s the beauty about travelling. \n\nStart your downtown journey admiring the architecture\
  \ from Pa\xE7o Imperial and CCBB. Both historical buildings are open cultural spaces\
  \ with art exhibitions, movie theatres, libraries and coffee shops. \nPa\xE7o Imperial\
  \ is located just across Pra\xE7a XV which is an important square with beautiful\
  \ monuments and ferries to Niter\xF3i. \n\nOn Saturdays a respectful antiques fair\
  \ happens at Pra\xE7a XV. After visiting it you should walk five minutes to CCBB\
  \ and admire it\u2019s beautiful Vitral ceiling and galeries. \n\nPlease be careful\
  \ when walking around Downtown during the weekends. It\u2019s not safe to carry\
  \ cameras around the neck and use jewelry. \n\nTake a rest and have some lunch at\
  \ the traditional Confeitaria Colombo, elected one of the most beautiful coffee\
  \ shop in the world by a website. It\u2019s not open on Sundays.\n\nLess than a\
  \ kilometer (or a mile) aways is the Public Library. The building, from 1810, is\
  \ the largest library of Latin America and has a huge collection of books and rare\
  \ documents. The library has free guided visits in Portuguese, Spanish and English\
  \ from Monday to Friday from 10am to 5pm.\n\nA three minute walk takes you to The\
  \ Municipal Theater, an Art Nouveau building from 1909. You can enjoy guided visits\
  \ in English, Portuguese or Spanish from Tuesday to Saturday at 4pm. The ticket\
  \ must be bought at the Theatre and costs R$20.00 (about 5 dollars). \n\n\nIn Rio\
  \ I can walk on busy financial district finding beauty and also cross the street\
  \ and just watch the ocean and those are some classic experiences that locals love\
  \ and everybody should try: have a beer at the beach, applaud the sunset at Arpoador,\
  \ eat a sliced picanha (delicious barbecue meat) and enjoy a samba at Lapa on weekend\
  \ evenings. \n\nVery important tips to help you around Rio de Janeiro. The city\
  \ is warm in the summer, like 100oF or /40oC and it rains a lot for a couple of\
  \ hours by the end of the day, specially in March.\n\nGet a hotel in Copacabana,\
  \ Leme or Ipanema. You can enjoy beautiful and famous beaches, great restaurants,\
  \ locals\u2019 attractions and beautiful views. It takes about 15-25 minutes from\
  \ Copacabana to Historical Rio de Janeiro by metro. \n \nSouth America can be violent.\
  \ Take care of your belongings, never react to robberies and always carry the \u201C\
  robber money\u201D, R$50 (about 10 dollars) that you keep in your pocket to give\
  \ away in case of an assault. Keep your real money in a security place close to\
  \ you. \nAlways carry some cash. Small business and informals vendors at the beach\
  \ tend not to accept credit cards. \nLast but not least: please leave your passport\
  \ at the hotel locker. You probably won\u2019t need it.\n\nHope you love Rio de\
  \ Janeiro as much as I do. Enjoy your stay!"
