Text: "The 31st of december. The very last day of the year i began my journey in Italy.\n\
  \nI took a flight in S\xE3o Paulo, had a stopover in Buenos Aires and then finally\
  \ Rome. I could feel from the airplane all the energy coming from the land of the\
  \ greatest Empire the Earth has ever seen it.\n\nI was very excited to go through\
  \ the ruins of the old city. But first i had to settle at the Airbnb booked not\
  \ speaking a single word in Italian. That was easy considering i could speak english,\
  \ right? The asnwer is no. Italy is very tied to its culture and English is only\
  \ spoken at tourist spots. After two days discovering the city I figured it out\
  \ the worst part the Roman city have to offer when i was approached by some African\
  \ fellows in front of the Colosseum. They came over me with  their handmade crafted\
  \ bracelets. One of them tried to shake hands with me in sign of good faith but\
  \ I quickly figured it out it was just a way to get closer and push the selling.\
  \ I did not respond the act and the bracelet was literally thrown over my head.\
  \ After I got through this unfortunate episode I was finally inside the Roman Forum.\
  \ I was so breathtaking that i just started walking....\n\nAfter a couple of days\
  \ connecting to the city I couldnt stop thinking about the Imigrattion issue Itally\
  \ has been going through. \n\nAnd there was one place where i could find my answers.\
  \ This place is Sicily considering the front gate for the Africans seeking for a\
  \ better life in Italy.\n\nMy first stop was Catania. The beatiful land of the Etna\
  \ Volcano. The city has been destroyed several times because of the eruptions. There\
  \ I had the chance to meet Chiara, a local guide who took me for a quick walk and\
  \ showed me what Catania has to offer in terms of good food. As long as Palermo,\
  \ Catania is also the portrait of the imigrattion problems Italy has been facing\
  \ over the last years. \n\nThe beatiful landscape is mixed with people literally\
  \ sleeping along the streets next to public buldings. I did not expect to see such\
  \ a view.\n\nOn the walls people try to pass along the dissatisfation message.\n\
  \n\"Salvini Parassita\"\n\nA clear attack to the minister known as his not very\
  \ popular politics about the coming imigrants.\n\nFive days in Sicily and I realized\
  \ that the roman empire once reconized by its conquers, now is just a pilled of\
  \ ruins left overs mixed with imigrattion problems.\n\nItaly is struggling..."
