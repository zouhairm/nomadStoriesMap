Text: "11.30pm, there was a knock on the door. I\u2019d had less than an hour of sleep,\
  \ but it was time to get up for our guided sunrise hike.\n\nThe two hour drive from\
  \ Kuta up to the volcano in the dark seemed to happen in a flash, as we\u2019d all\
  \ slept almost the whole time. 1am, we met our guide who provided us with water\
  \ and head torches. We began the trail and were met by staircases. The guide told\
  \ us to pace ourselves. I thought that there couldn\u2019t be that many stairs to\
  \ climb. I had thought wrong. After about ten minutes of climbing stairs, we realised\
  \ we\u2019d been too eager. We slowed right down and were thankful when the stairs\
  \ eventually stopped. In front of us was Besakih Temple. We welcomed  a drink and\
  \ a sit down, our thighs were burning. \n\n\u201CAre you ready?\u201D Asked our\
  \ guide. We rose and followed him. Looking back now, it  odd that we volunteered\
  \ to follow a stranger into the jungle in Indonesia, in the dark.\n\nThe hike started\
  \ off slow, there were plenty of hazards in the jungle and I often tripped, as I\
  \ usually do, even on flat ground. Once our guide noticed this, we stopped and he\
  \ provided us with banana fritters, they were still warm. \n\nI couldn\u2019t understand\
  \ why we were continuously stopping, as our hike was not overly exerting. Then,\
  \ all of a sudden, the hike began to become less of a hike and more of a climb.\
  \ I\u2019d never climbed up anything more than a playground in my life. I was thankful\
  \ for all of the stops.\n\n After about an hour on non-consecutive climbing in a\
  \ less-than-vertical position, my head began spinning and my stomach started churning.\
  \ \n\n\nI looked around me and realised we\u2019d climbed above the jungle. We soon\
  \ stopped and I felt so ill.\n\n4.30am, I couldn\u2019t even fathom walking on any\
  \ further. A larger group of people joined us at the stop. Our guide seemed to know\
  \ them and walked off with some of them to built a little fire. The group began\
  \ eating snacks and preparing coffee in a camping kettle. The smell of the coffee\
  \ was making me feel worse. \n\nSuddenly, I jumped up and found the nearest tree,\
  \ where my stomach decided to alleviate itself of the churning sensation. \n\nWhen\
  \ I returned to the group the other people seemed very concerned about me and told\
  \ me with such vigour to eat their chocolate and drink their coffee. I refused,\
  \ the last thing I wanted to was to eat. The group soon turned their doting on me\
  \ into anger towards my partner. They began to scold him for allowing me to climb,\
  \ \u2018in my condition\u2019. This surprised us both.\n\nWhen the group was satisfied\
  \ that I was confident in my decision not to eat, they began to pack up so they\
  \ could continue on. Our guide spoke to them in Indonesian and they looked back\
  \ at me in my t-shirt and leggings. Instantly the group began offering us their\
  \ clothes and a foil sheet to keep warm. Initially, I refused. They became so insistent\
  \ and told me I would freeze when sunlight hit if I wasn\u2019t in anything warm.\
  \ The last words spoken before they left was, \u201CDo not let her fall asleep.\u201D\
  \ in a very cold tone to my partner. They were still quite irked with him. \n\n\
  The next hour or so, was spent with my partner desperately trying to not let me\
  \ sleep. Then, at 6am, the sun began to rise. We watched the landscape unfold in\
  \ front of us. We hadn\u2019t realised we\u2019d climbed so far up. We were above\
  \ the cloud line. The sky lit up as the sun hit the summit of the volcano and peeked\
  \ over the top.\n\nEven though we didn\u2019t make it to the summit, this is one\
  \ of my favourite travel memories. The kindness of the climbing community, (who\
  \ we later found out thought I was pregnant), and the amazing scenery we watched\
  \ that morning. It was a spectacular trip and was a massive achievement to make\
  \ it that far."
