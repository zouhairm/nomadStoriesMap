Text: "I was 15 years old when I took one of the biggest scares of my life, amidst\
  \ the winter beauty of which I had seen when I was near the Atacama desert. From\
  \ Chile, after leaving Santiago, a wonderful city with an incredible gastronomy\
  \ and a cozy spirit, I met in San Pedro de Atacama before leaving for the Bolivian\
  \ Salares, everything from the beginning seemed like an exciting and incredible\
  \ Adventure.\nAmong the days that I spent in San Pedro de Atacama, I was able to\
  \ have the pleasure of witnessing the geysers of Tatio, a beautiful natural spectacle\
  \ that which combined with the morning's splendor created a unique experience of\
  \ life. Leaving the city at dawn (something close to 4 in the morning) by bus to\
  \ reach the geysers in the period of activity (between 5am -7 am) I had never felt\
  \ so cold in my whole life as in that early morning\nGoing through the desert, we\
  \ crossed the border and passed immigration control between Chile and Bolivia. Using\
  \ a 4x4 to cross those endless sand roads the adventure became even more exciting,\
  \ our first stop was in the Desert of Dali, that receives this name due to the similarity\
  \ with the works of the painter. After this we continue to Laguna Colorada, an incredible\
  \ demonstration of nature's grandeur, an immense lagoon of natural red waters, full\
  \ of flamingos, it is essential the visit for those who go to the Atacama desert,\
  \ needing to stay at least to take one photo. Thanks to the winter, the cold did\
  \ not forgive, but still worth very much to have to get all dressed up with winter\
  \ clothes and still felling cold but beeing able to check that incredible place.\
  \ \nFinally we arrived at the hostel in the middle of the desert, to rest and continue\
  \ the journey the next morning, until then everything was fine, much like many other\
  \ hostels around the world, a simple shower (in which almost nobody tried the luck\
  \ with the lack of hot water in the middle of the winter) for dinner we had sausage\
  \ and smashed potato, with the hunger we all felt, it was like a 5 star dish. At\
  \ bedtime it was more complicated, 10 people in the same room, beds with stone base,\
  \ and the incessant cold.\nBut was then that my luck changed for worse, i started\
  \ feeling a little pain in my chest, then i felt shortness of breath, and for last\
  \ some headache. it was weak at the beginning but i was incapable to sleep and it\
  \ was getting stronger. When it was something close to 2 am i had to get up and\
  \ ask for some oxygen cilinders, after that i was a little better and could sleep\
  \ for a short time. When te sun raised, me and my family went back with a guide\
  \ at the 4x4 through all the desert again, we took the first plane to santiago and\
  \ then we went back to brazil, i had an suspection of start of embolysm, after staying\
  \ a couple of days at the hospital everything was fine again and that amazing, but\
  \ the feeling of the unfinished trip still teases me in a good way, reminding me,\
  \ how its so unique all the diferents travels experiencies, every single one is\
  \ a new way of seeing that you discover."
