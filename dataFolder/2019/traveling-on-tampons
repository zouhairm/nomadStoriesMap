Text: "Speaking about menses has always been a taboo in large parts of the world for\
  \ a long time. Women, as and when they enter the cycle every month, are considered\
  \ unwholesome, abstaining them from entering the kitchen and places of worship to\
  \ the extent of not letting them serve cooked meals or go anywhere near the flora.\
  \ And the list goes on \u2026 This belief is not entirely wrong if we\u2019re to\
  \ take into account the scientific explanation behind it. In olden days, when illiteracy\
  \ was widespread and there was lesser access to hygiene, the few educated elders\
  \ must have forced these practices so as to keep away from the bacteria and mucus\
  \ secreted out of a woman\u2019s body during menstruation.\nHowever, although the\
  \ process we, as women, undergo is the same, we\u2019re aware of maintaining hygiene\
  \ at all times during periods. It is not about shaming ourselves or hurting the\
  \ sentiments of the religious lot, but it is more about fighting the cramps, the\
  \ mood swings, the uneasiness we feel during such times, check-marking calendars\
  \ just so we don\u2019t miss the date. In spite of all the trouble we take, sometimes,\
  \ menses have a mind of their own and come unannounced often when you\u2019re all\
  \ excited about that vacation.\nSo here I was \u2013 travelling and on my periods!\
  \ I didn\u2019t have control over the latter, and I didn\u2019t want to postpone\
  \ the former. So I started my journey, refreshing every now and then at the back\
  \ of my head \u2014 Come What May! It was definitely not easy, holding nature\u2019\
  s call until I found clean washrooms with sufficient water supply and proper disposals\
  \ (If you didn\u2019t know, women\u2019s body is more receptive to infections and\
  \ viruses during this phase). I wouldn\u2019t be at peace until we reached the hotel.\n\
  The real challenge came when my pious friends decided to visit the famous temple,\
  \ Sri Bhagandeshwara, of the region. Not that I was against any religious beliefs,\
  \ but \u2014 \u201CI was on my periods\u201D! The moral seeds had been sowed inside\
  \ my thick head much before I could differentiate right from wrong. Now it was more\
  \ of a habit, and old habits die hard. Almost five minutes on the outside of the\
  \ temple, waiting for them to mop up the rituals, and I started to get fidgety.\
  \ Did I come this far to sit outside while my friends made offerings? I didn\u2019\
  t have any offerings as such; nevertheless, I wanted to do anything but sit idle\
  \ and almost roasted! Questions started to pop up from nowhere.\nThey wrapped up\
  \ in 15 \u2013 20 minutes and headed to dip their feet in the holy Triveni Sangam.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t hold any longer, nor could I withstand the sun shining right through\
  \ my skin. The next moment I stood alongside my peers in the cool water of the mighty\
  \ Cauvery, Kannike, and Sujyothi. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, but that\
  \ was all I wanted to do then. By the time I was fully aware, I had already stepped\
  \ into the shrine of Talakaveri, another magnificent architecture.\nAs I look back,\
  \ I feel accomplished as a woman and more as a human. Sometimes it is tough to break\
  \ away from old habits, but if one\u2019s happy doing so, and until it doesn\u2019\
  t bring harm to the rest, why not? It\u2019s time we be the change!"
