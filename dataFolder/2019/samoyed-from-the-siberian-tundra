Text: "After a marvellous night's sleep, I awakened to another splendid day on this\
  \ blessed isle, looking forward in anxious anticipation to exploring the many delights\
  \ of Tahiti. However, I had just finished breakfast, when came a soft knock at the\
  \ the door of my quaint little hut. \n\nIt was my eminent friend and colleague,\
  \ of whom I spoke in my last E-mail, carrying a huge bundle which he unceremoniously\
  \ dropped onto my cot. He proceeded to unwrap it..........To my utter amazement,\
  \ the bundle contained an assortment of Arctic Clothing \n\n\nAfter singing a warm\
  \ 'goodbye' to Papeete, Tahiti, we whispered a frosty 'hello' to the vast Siberian\
  \ Tundra, arriving eventually by dog sled on the ice of the Jenissei River between\
  \ Turuchansk and Dudino.\nUnfortunately, the tents we had ordered in advance were\
  \ not read.\n\nThus after another long delay and an irreparable loss of time, considering\
  \ the extreme shortness of the summer, we continued on our journey, hoping to regain\
  \ lost time by increasing our pace. The softening of the snow rendered the advance\
  \ of the sledges extremely difficult.\n\nEncamping on a steep declivity of the river\
  \ bank, the rapidly melting ice and snow, necessitated the building of our boat\
  \ immediately.In about two weeks, the ice on the river began to break up, and in\
  \ three more days the navigation of the stream was free.\nwe left dry land and took\
  \ to the water in earnest. The constant north winds retarded the voyage down the\
  \ river and over the lake, beyond which, the TAIMYR , traversing a hilly country,\
  \ is inclosed within steep and picturesque rocks \n\nThe increasing rapidity of\
  \ the stream now favored our progress, and the storms were less troublesome between\
  \ the mighty rock-walls; but unfortunately we discovered that, instead of being\
  \ able, as expected, to fill our nets with fish as we advanced, and to establish\
  \ 'depots' for the return journey, found ourselves obliged to consume the provisions\
  \ we had taken with us in the boat.\n\nThe first 'night frost' came shortly thereafter\
  \ and from that time was regularily repeated. Yet in spite of these warnings we\
  \ continued our journey down the river, reaching the sea about a month later.\n\n\
  But now it was high time to return! The great distance from any human habitation,\
  \ the rapid stream, against which we now had to contend, and the advanced season,\
  \ with its approaching dark nights and frosts, made our immediate return an imperative\
  \ necessity.\n\n\nThe borders of the river were already encrusted with ice. Wading\
  \ became extremely irksome, the river having meanwhile fallen above six feet, and\
  \ the shallows frequently forcing us to step into the water and pull the boat along.\n\
  \nFortunately the wind remained favorable, and thus by rowing to the utmost of our\
  \ strength, and with the assistance of the broad sails of our \"PNASI\", we surmounted\
  \ two rapids which, encased between abrupt rocks, seemed to defy our utmost efforts.\n\
  \nHowever, a malicious gust of wind, bursting out of a narrow gorge, threw our boat\
  \ against the rocks and broke the rudder.\n\nThe frost and wet, together with the\
  \ shortness of our provisions, tried us sorely. Not a day passed without sleet or\
  \ snow.\n\nThe violent wind, covered our clothes with solid ice crusts. rendering\
  \ our situation almost intolerable\n\n\nThe Samoyed breed name comes from the Samoyed\
  \ people  of the Siberian tundra. Samoyeds were kept for ages by this nomadic tribe,\
  \ who, by necessity, were strongly attached to their dogs. A few of the Samoyed's\
  \ functions that made the dogs crucial to the tribe's survival were pulling sleds,\
  \ herding reindeer and alerting their masters to approaching danger\n. Samoyeds\
  \ have a fluffy white coat that sheds twice a year and are always alert and will\
  \ easily adapt to any environment."
