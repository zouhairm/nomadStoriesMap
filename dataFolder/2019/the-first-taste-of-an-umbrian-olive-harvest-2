Text: "It was sunrise as I rode on the back of a tractor to my first day of work on\
  \ an olive farm in Umbria.\_ Staying with an Italian family who runs an\_\u2018\
  agriturismo\u2019 (B&B farmstay)\_in the countryside, our small olive harvest team\
  \ led by\_Nonna\_was a mix of locals, friends, family, and me.\n\nRiding down the\
  \ hills I can see the farm ahead, almost 300 olive trees, some 100 years old, full\
  \ of green olives ready to drop.\_Nonna\_demonstrates how to comb the branches gently\
  \ to allow the olives to fall naturally into the nets below the trees. Loading me\
  \ with gloves and a trusty little hand rake, I was ready for day one of \u2018la\_\
  raccolta' (the collection).\_\_\n\nNets are expertly rolled out by the men, surrounding\
  \ the base of the trees and beyond, with a number of metal stakes dug into the ground\
  \ to create a mini wall of\_net\_to stop the precious cargo rolling away.\_\n\n\
  I begin combing the low hanging olives at shoulder height, when all of a sudden\
  \ Nonna hands me a\_3-metre\_old wooden ladder and expects me to climb it. Almost\
  \ toppling over with the height and weight of it, I could barely carry the ladder\
  \ let alone figure out where to lean it, I mean, olive trees are not exactly sturdy\
  \ walls! Standing still and uncertain,\_Nonna\_sees me and with her signature handkerchief\
  \ tied on her head comes over, picks up my ladder and casually shoves it among the\
  \ branches; \"vai,\_su\", \"go, get up\", leaving me no choice but to climb.\_ \n\
  \nHer tiny 4 foot nothing frame has worked on over 65 olive harvests, she \u2018\
  combs' the olive branches with her bare sturdy hands, and lifts that ladder and\
  \ climbs without a moment's hesitation,\_putting me to shame.\_ I am finally at\
  \ the top, fear long gone as I look around at the stunning view.\_ Ancient stone\
  \ villas atop of Umbrian rolling hills, medieval villages, and olive trees as far\
  \ as I can see. I am full of joy and overcome with gratitude\_of\_living in Italy.\_\
  \n\nTen hours in the Italian sunshine, aching shoulders from repetitive \u2018combing'\
  \ and thousands of green olives falling to the nets below, the work is physical\
  \ and hard yet so satisfying.\_ All by hand, tree by tree, this family harvests\
  \ these olives every season just as their ancestors did.\_ I\_am honoured\_to be\_\
  part of the tradition.\_\n\nSurrounded by the older generation in their 60's and\
  \ 70's, they make the harvest look easy and fun as I work hard and enjoy the banter\
  \ in their local Umbrian dialect.\_ I learn quickly, \u2018comb' the olive branches\
  \ for hours, avoid falling off the ladders, I carry nets, roll them out, and help\
  \ the men manoeuvre thousands of olives from the nets into crates. We harvest over\
  \ 800\_kilos\_on the first day, which can produce around 160\_litres\_of extra virgin\
  \ olive oil.\_\n\nEach day we transport our harvest to the \u2018fattoria', a farmhouse\
  \ with a restored 17th - century olive mill, to produce the highest quality and\
  \ freshest extra virgin olive oil through a cold-press process. Mesmerized as the\
  \ olives\_are washed and tossed around, I watch as the leaves are removed and the\
  \ olives fall into the huge vats where blades crush and press the olives.\_ It's\
  \ then,\_struck by the most wonderful aroma seeping out of the vats, pure fresh\
  \ oil, it was the earth, olives, sunshine and grass all rolled into one, I inhale\
  \ deeply, overcome with gratitude again.\n\nSlowly the oil extracts and I watch\
  \ proudly as the thick golden, vibrant green oil drips out, oozing quality and shine.\_\
  \ Allowed the first taste, I pause and savour the aromas of the earth with a distinct,\
  \ strong olive\_flavour,\_peppery but smooth, the heavenly result of our days\u2019\
  \ labour.\n\nNot knowing what to expect, I worked hard, but it was more than just\
  \ physical\_effort. I was part of a family tradition with a passion and love of\
  \ producing a product by hand,\_honouring\_their ancestors.\n\nA wonderfully grounding\
  \ and rewarding experience, opening me up to feel so proud of my own Italian roots."
