Text: "First trip out of my Country\n\nOne and a half year after my graduation as\
  \ an architect with a scholar loan, struggling to find a job in my field with a\
  \ very little hope to get, living in a tiny apartment with my brother, and working\
  \ as a Spanish Facilitator which at least guarantee a minimum income to solve my\
  \ basic needs a trip that I didn\u2019t even dream of with few weeks before occurred!!!\
  \ \n\nIn this job I met who is still my very best friend and \u201CFairy Godmother\u201D\
  !!! She found a newspaper in which was announced a scholarship for a Latin-American,\
  \ with less than two years graduated and in which my career was listed!!! Bingo!!!\
  \  She thought, you fit perfectly!!! \n\nI took the newspaper with no intention\
  \ to apply abandoning it in few seconds. Her enthusiasm disappeared sooner than\
  \ giving myself the opportunity to think in what I was about to let go!!!\n\nBored\
  \ to arrive to the same routine every day, I decided to take the risk for such an\
  \ opportunity spite I didn\u2019t have still much hope to get it and with no idea\
  \ where the newspaper had ended up. My friend and I jumped into a small, dark, and\
  \ infernal room where the old newspapers used to be saved and after an intense,\
  \ maddening and suffocating quest, the miracle occurred: we got it!!!\n\nI had Immediately\
  \ to start the search for the documentation I needed to fill up all the forms required\
  \ to be accepted. It was August 1998 and only had two days to the deadline to post\
  \ mail the acceptance papers. I did it\u2026\n\nHere my odyssey was just starting\u2026\
  \n\nOn September 21st George Hurricane hit the Dominican Republic. Almost all bridges\
  \ and roads were destroyed, especially in the south area and hundreds of communities\
  \ isolated. Phones lines neither were working in most of cities.In my mother\u2019\
  s house, three hours away from where I lived and one of the most affected areas\
  \ by the storm, entered just two calls: one of them from Spain. I had gotten the\
  \ scholarship!!! \n\nMy brother took the call. They wanted a fax number that he\
  \ didn\u2019t have. He asked the person to call back so he could find one which\
  \ was working. She never called again\u2026\n\nMy family neither had a way to communicate\
  \ with me, but a friend got to arrive to the town after a long, expensive and dangerous\
  \ journey to know about his relatives. He must go back to work as soon as possible\
  \ so he brought the message and the first news I had about my family situation.\
  \ \n\nAfter a difficult process finally I got the scholarship details: within eleven\
  \ days I had to accept it, get a passport and visa, find money, a place to live\
  \ in a unknown country, prepare a luggage for a cold weather in a tropical country\
  \ and worse than everything to get allowance from my doctor to leave the country\
  \ after an anemia which I was fighting with. \n\nStill I wasn\u2019t sure to go,\
  \ especially after an expensive call for a reservation in a hostel. The lady who\
  \ answered was so rude that reinforced my desire to \nabandone the idea to go\u2026\
  \ \n\nIn my way to the airport, I couldn\u2019t stop crying\u2026 \n\nOnce at the\
  \ airport to worsen everything I was stopped by a suspicion of illegal documentation.\
  \ They made me walk almost all airport back and forth and after a long embarrassing\
  \ confrontation and with risk to loss my flight, they let me go\u2026\n\nOnce in\
  \ Spain I felt so bad: freezing, missing my family, friends, food, weather, my unorganized\
  \ and noisy traffic, alone and wishing that everything was just a nightmare!!!\n\
  \ \nNevertheless, soon I realized into the incredibly fantastic culture, people,\
  \ gastronomy, history, and architecture I arrived to giving me the unique privilege\
  \ to walk into buildings, streets, cities, and centuries that only existed in my\
  \ books, classrooms, and dreams in my faraway island that I was so afraid to leave!!!\
  \ And most important: I grew up!!!\n\nNine months after I came back home into tears\u2026\
  \ leaving behind a place, lifechanging adventure, and friends that taught me to\
  \ open forever my former limited horizons\u2026"
