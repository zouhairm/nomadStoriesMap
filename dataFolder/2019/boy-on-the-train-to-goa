Text: "I have learnt a disproportionately high amount of life lessons aboard trains.\
  \ There's something about the landscapes flying by and the hours spent people watching\
  \ that encourages a certain romantic contemplation of humanity. Such blissful trips\
  \ spent looking out the window are however not the train journeys that have made\
  \ long-lasting impressions on me. There have been times when the train trip itself\
  \ has been the adventure, like sitting with my feet dangling out of a Sri Lankan\
  \ train door, waving at workers on tea plantations and children playing in rivers\
  \ in the valleys below. Or a twenty-four hour journey across the steppe in Kazakhstan\
  \ in a compartment with three kind Kazakh men. We somehow conversed in a mix of\
  \ broken English and Russian about topics as wide-ranging as whether there are Muslims\
  \ in Australia to corruption in the Kazakh government. All over shared bread and\
  \ bitter green tea, of course.\n\nA sleeper carriage on an Indian train is a place\
  \ where you can fully immerse yourself in what it means to be alive. The rich tapestry\
  \ of life, on show for all who pass through the narrow corridors, inevitably rolled\
  \ out on the floor for the unlucky latecomer unable to find an empty bed. One's\
  \ senses are constantly overstimulated in India, and this is no less true aboard\
  \ a train. There is ceaseless noise; the clatter of the train on the tracks, the\
  \ whirling overhead fans, men chanting\_chai, chai over and over. Smells; spicy\
  \ samosas on offer day and night, burning plastic wafting in through open windows.\
  \ Sights; families pausing to observe the train as they walk along the tracks, hijra\_\
  walking the corridors offering blessings in exchange for rupees.\n\nThis particular\
  \ train journey had been more calm than most; my friend's uncle had boarded the\
  \ train with me and issued what I can only imagine was a threat to the locals in\
  \ the carriage who then didn't encroach on my space, at least for the beginning\
  \ of the journey. Some time into the fourteen hour trip I was lying on my bunk reading\
  \ my Kindle when an inquisitive young boy came over and hovered next to my head.\
  \ I had quietly been observing his family, the three of them sitting on a bunk on\
  \ the same lower level as mine, but had been absorbed in my book and hadn't noticed\
  \ him gain the courage to come over to me. I said hello and showed him the obvious\
  \ object of his attention, my Kindle. He tried on my glasses, looked at the words\
  \ on the page, laughter ensued. I learnt that he was ten years old and learning\
  \ English at school, so entered into the kind of conversation one might imagine\
  \ about where I was from, what his favourite subjects were. His mum offered me chapati,\
  \ a staple of the Indian diet, perfect to accompany the aromatic curries that appear\
  \ out of tiffin tins at meal times during train rides.\_We began to reach a point\
  \ where all known formulations of English questions had been exhausted but the universal\
  \ language of smiles and laughter sufficed. It was at this point that he turned\
  \ to me with a curious look in his eye and asked \"which caste are you?\".\n\nI\
  \ was baffled. What I don't remember about this encounter is what I managed to say\
  \ in response to this beautifully innocent yet devastating question. It struck me\
  \ how this child and I were worlds apart; I sat on that train with almost every\
  \ facet of privilege one can have in our society, while caste plays such a significant\
  \ role in this boy's life that such a question comes after \"what is your favourite\
  \ sport?\". How utterly unfair this world can be.\n\nIn the middle of the night\
  \ I awoke hazily to notice that the boy and his parents were collecting their things\
  \ to get off the train. I sat up and waved as they shuffled past sleeping bodies\
  \ on the floor. Trains offer a brief glimpse into the lives of others, offering\
  \ up raw humanity to either be drowned out with music blasting through headphones\
  \ or delved into through a smile, or a conversation with an inquisitive young boy."
