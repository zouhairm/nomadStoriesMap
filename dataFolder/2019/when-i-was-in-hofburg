Text: "Once upon a time, there was a prince, named Maximilian von Habsburg, who was\
  \ proclaimed earl of Innsbruck by his father. And when he was crowned as Sacred\
  \ Emperor, he decided to leave Vienna and to establish a new capital city in Innsbruck,\
  \ because when you are born at Tyrol, you love your homeland and expect to return\
  \ as soon as possible. Here at Tyrol, everybody worships the Holy Virgin Mary and\
  \ there\u2019s an image of her in every door for protection. And when Maximilian\
  \ has married for the first time, he had a son named Philip, the one that we know\
  \ as the Handsome, father of Charles the V. And when Maximilian\u2019s first wife\
  \ was dead, the emperor married himself for the second time with Maria Sforza, and\
  \ he gave her as a present a beautiful roof made with gold, wich still is the most\
  \ important symbol of Innsbruck. It is said that every couple who marries in Tyrol\
  \ has to be photographed under the golden roof in order to have a prosperous marriage.\
  \ \nThere was a time when lived a loving mother called Marie Therese, Franz von\
  \ Habsburg\u2019s widow, who was to be regent of his son Jozef for many years. And\
  \ Marie Therese, in order to avoid too much problems for her young son, decided\
  \ to move the Austrian court back to Hofburg, a small hunting lodge in Innsbruck,\
  \ the Tyrolese capital. And while she and her whole family were in Innsbruck, al\
  \ the princes and princesses were painted in beautiful portraits. Everyone who enters\
  \ in Hofburg will meet a young Marie Antoinette, before she was married to the Dauphin,\
  \ Louis, and will also meet Joseph, the musical emperor, patron of Mozart. \nOnce\
  \ upon a time, there was a man called Andre\xE4s Hoffer, who organized the Tyrolese\
  \ people and fought against Napoleon, because Tyrol is a strategical land between\
  \  France, and Switzerland and Italy. But every Tyrolese love their land and they\u2019\
  ll never surrender to the French invader.\nOnce upon a time, there was a beautiful\
  \ Bavarian princess, called Elizabeth, who has fallen deep in love with an archduke,\
  \ the young Franz Joseph von Habsburg, And we know that princess as Empress Sissi,\
  \ who traveled from Vienna to Bavaria  and rested at Innsbruck, because Hofburg\
  \ palace, at summer, was the most quiet place for her and her family. \nOnce upon\
  \ a time, there was a little child who had his mother and his granny, women in love\
  \ with history. They taught him to love Viennese waltzes and Romy Schenider\u2019\
  s movies. And when he saw these movies, and when he danced with Strauss, he learned\
  \ part of Habsburg\u2019s history, a family that this young child loved and admired.\n\
  Twenty years later, maybe even more, that young child had a hearing with Empress\
  \ Sissi, and Marie Therese, and Maximilian and Franz Joseph at Hofburg Innsbruck.\
  \ And I was received in the conference room, wich had an entire table served for\
  \ coffee and desserts. And I walked down the portrait gallery and saw the young\
  \ princesses, Marie Antoinette and Marie Josepha dressed as hunters. And the emperor\
  \ Franz Joseph and the empress Elizabeth taught that little boy (because when I\
  \ saw their portraits, I\u2019ve returned to my childhood) how wonderful is to live\
  \ in the middle of the Austrian alps, in Innsbruck, in this beautiful town which\
  \ doesn\u2019t change even the time goes by. And I can assure you, that Innsbruck\
  \ is gold as the roof of Maximilian, white as the snow on top of the Alps, grey\
  \ like it\u2019s gothic buildings, and pink as it\u2019s baroque buildings. \nI\
  \ was very honored to spent some time with the austrain-hungarian emperors, and\
  \ as a loyal subject, I hope to find their royal majesties again, perhaps in Sch\xF6\
  nbrunn-Vienna. But the royal protocol forbids the visitor to photograph the entire\
  \ palace, so I hope, my dear reader, you may imagine how beautiful are the celestial\
  \ blue inside the Conference Room, or the deep purple inside the Visiting Room,\
  \ or how brilliant are the golden lines over the Austrian crystal of the royal table."
