Text: "On 2017 I decided I was going solo travel for the first time and Europe sounded\
  \ like a good idea for it.\nMy first stop was Rome. I remember feeling like a Polly\
  \ Pocket doll in the middle of these huge and stunningly beautiful monuments. The\
  \ buildings were old and painted in pastel colors, it felt like being in a Wes Anderson\
  \ film. \n\nIt was my last day in the city and I was very tired of walking so I\
  \ sat on a fountain in \u201CPiazza Navona\u201D, I put my sunglasses on, put my\
  \ earphones on, played Ludovico Einaudi\u2019s song \u201CI Giorni\u201D to be specific,\
  \ I grabbed my notebook, and started to write. \n\nI was sitting there, dressed\
  \ in yellow pants and gray shirt, writing about my experiences so far, when this\
  \ good-looking Italian guy came to me and touched my shoulder, I looked up pulling\
  \ my sunglasses down to my nose, and he said: \u201Chi, I am working with the photographer\
  \ standing in the building over there, and we need to take a picture of the fountain\
  \ without people, could you please move?\u201D. \n\nI moved. He had to move everyone\
  \ in the fountain so I offered to help. We cleared the fountain together and as\
  \ a reward, he invited me to meet the photographer he was working with: Gail Albert\
  \ Halaban. \n\nThey were working on a Project called \u201COut my Window\u201D,\
  \ they invited me to help in the photo shoot, and without a doubt, I said yes. I\
  \ ended up being in the photograph! After a while, Filippo (the Italian) said  I\
  \ could not have gone to Rome without having been on a scooter ride, so he asked\
  \ Gail for an hour break and he took me on his scooter through Rome, it was absolutely\
  \ magical. I was already in love with this guy. \n\nI had a train ticket for Florence\
  \ the next day in the morning, so we said goodbye to each other promising we will\
  \ meet again someday. \nEven though I was in this attractive city, I was melancholic\
  \ because I missed him, I found myself sitting in the stairs of a lookout watching\
  \ the sunset, it was extremely hot, I was eating a baguette and I was listening\
  \ to a man playing his guitar, I saw Filippo\u2019s picture and all I could wish\
  \ for was him being there with me, I thought how can someone just not be there anymore?\
  \ I thought it would be better if I have not met him at all, but at the same time,\
  \ the man in the guitar sang a phrase that really resonated with me: \u201Cit is\
  \ enough to have bumped into each other\u201D so I smiled. \n\nLater on, it was\
  \ time for me to go to Venice, and as I headed for the train station it occurred\
  \ to me that I should return to Rome, it did not make any sense to me taking the\
  \ risk of not seeing Filippo ever again. So I ran to the station carrying my heavy\
  \ luggage and as I was desperately looking for a cheap bus to Rome, my prepaid train\
  \ to Venice departed. Shoot. All of a sudden I saw a sign saying \u201CRome 1 minute\u201D\
  \ so I ran again and hopped on. \nI could not stop smiling, I was shaking and my\
  \ heart was beating hard. He did not know I was going back, but once I got there\
  \ I texted him. I know, I am crazy; as I walked to the meeting point, I passed the\
  \ Trevi fountain, and as funny as it sounds, I threw a coin and wished I was Filippo\u2019\
  s girlfriend. We saw each other again and we had the most incredible time. \n\n\
  I gave him a postcard from my hometown where I wrote how amazing he was, and that\
  \ I would be traveling around Europe for several days. A few days later he texted\
  \ me asking if he could join me in London and Madrid, and of course, I said yes.\
  \ \n\nI went back to Mexico and he went back to Italy not knowing if we would meet\
  \ again, but knowing we had found love on the other side."
