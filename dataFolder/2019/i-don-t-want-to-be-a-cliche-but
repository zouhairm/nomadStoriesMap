Text: "About a year ago, something happened in my life that immensely shook my world.\
  \ Within a few weeks, everything changed. I realize that this is quite a clich\xE9\
  \ to lead into a story about embarking on traveling to find yourself, but that is\
  \ exactly what happened to me.\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily feel the need to elaborate\
  \ on the events that brought on my desperate escape. I just packed a carry-on with\
  \ some clothes, some toiletries, my camera, and my notebook. An hour later, I was\
  \ at the airport. The next flight to Barcelona was in a few hours so I had plenty\
  \ of time to check in, find a seat by the windows and watch as the airplanes left\
  \ the tarmac one by one. \n\nI don't think I have ever been more terrified in my\
  \ life. I was about to take off to a foreign country, by myself with no plans. My\
  \ only goal was to just go. I had plenty of time to back out, come to my senses\
  \ and realize this was the most impulsive and reckless decision I have ever made.\n\
  \nAfter  8.5 hours of flying and finding a cheap, last-minute room, I broke down.\
  \ I haven\u2019t even opened my suitcase, I was ready to head back to the airport\
  \ and go home. With all of that built up energy, fear, and maybe even temporary\
  \ insanity, all I could do was cry until my head hurt so much I had no choice but\
  \ to go out and find something to eat.\n\nI left the hotel which was hidden at the\
  \ end of a sketchy alley, and found myself walking along La Rambla. Hundreds of\
  \ tourists were strolling along with just as many locals selling their products,\
  \ promoting their businesses, inviting people to immerse themselves within the Spanish\
  \ culture. I was absolutely mesmerized. \n\nI couldn\u2019t stop moving. I kept\
  \ my head up because I didn\u2019t want to miss anything. Gaud\xED architecture\
  \ in every direction, fountains in the middle of the roads, ice cream shops on every\
  \ corner. I wasn\u2019t even paying attention to where I was going. What eventually\
  \ made me stop was finally stumbling upon La Sagrada Fam\xEDlia. I had to remember\
  \ to catch my breath, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off of this magnificent work\
  \ of art. \n\nI found an empty park bench across from the church, and even though\
  \ it was getting dark I kept my sunglasses on to hide the tears that were welling\
  \ up in my eyes. And then I instantly took out my notebook and started to write.\
  \ I was suddenly feeling a lot of uncontrollable emotions, but fear was no longer\
  \ one of them. I realized that if I had given in to my fear of being alone, I would\
  \ have never overcome my biggest obstacle. I have been making up excuses and staying\
  \ in my comfort zone, and I have been holding myself back from exploring the unknown.\
  \ \n\nBarcelona was my first solo trip, and it scared the hell out of me, but it\
  \ really did change my life. Since then, I have been constantly seeking opportunities\
  \ to be able to maintain my on-the-go, adventurous lifestyle. I have had to create\
  \ those opportunities for myself often, and I have always welcomed the task. Over\
  \ the past year, I have had the chance to repeat this life altering experience by\
  \ running away to Budapest and hopping on a night bus to Croatia, only to wake up\
  \ in Italy the next morning, or taking an impromptu flight to Lisbon and renting\
  \ a mini car to explore Sintra for the day. \n\nNo matter what country I have found\
  \ myself in, I have always felt a bit scared of not knowing what to expect. But\
  \ that fear has also fuelled my passion for continuing this journey. I have learned\
  \ more about myself in the past few months than I have in 26 years. I realize I\
  \ am not the most skilled writer, but I am definitely working on it. I am a creative\
  \ person, and most importantly an adventurer, and I cannot find anything more exhilarating\
  \ than taking a leap into the unknown and sharing my experiences with the world."
