Text: "Brazil is well-known for its Carnival street party, specialy in Rio de Janeiro\
  \ town. Along the years, however, the number of Carnival parties in other cities\
  \ have grown. It is possible to find interesting places from Southeast to Northeast\
  \ to spend Carnival, from S\xE3o Paulo until Recife. The small charming village\
  \ of Tiradentes, in Minas Gerais, however, stays unknown for the most of the people.\
  \ Tiradentes is a five hours car travel distance from Rio de. It has a very well\
  \ conserved historical downtown, stage of almost all Carnival parades. What makes\
  \ Tiradentes different from other places is its touristic structure, with chic hotels,\
  \ good restaurants and stores with local items to shop.\nMe, my wife and a friend\
  \ couple stayed at Toque Mineiro, a guesthouse owned by gentle couple named Carla\
  \ and Renato. The guesthouse has both the advantage and disadvantage of being 2\
  \ km away from downtown. I say it is a disadvantage because is necessary to drive\
  \ or take a cab to go to downtown. On the other hand, to be a little bit far from\
  \ downtown, it assures a quiet night and reserved moment whenever one is the mood.\
  \ They have two swimming pools: a smaller one in the sun and a bigger one, warm\
  \ and covered. This bigger swimming pool is providential in rainy days, when there\
  \ is no sun and everything is wet outside. I shall not forget to comment about their\
  \ wide breakfast table, with fruits, milk, cereals, cheese and their delicious homemade\
  \ cakes. These cakes are also available in the afternoon, always with coffee \u2013\
  \ consequence of local habit of eating cake with coffee by four or five pm \u2013\
  \ similar to the English five o\u2019clock tea habit. Another pleasant local habit\
  \ they keep and share with their guests is to have \u201Cdois dedos de prosa\u201D\
  , which means to have small talks with everyone in guesthouse. \nSpending Carnival\
  \ time in Tiradentes means having slow and quiet mornings with funny and musical\
  \ afternoon and night. We visited every little shop in downtown during the mornings.\
  \ It is feasible to go through all historical downtown in less than an hour. We\
  \ spent time, then, shopping and taking pictures of the historical buildings. To\
  \ shopping, the town has a whole option of home items, like furniture, sheets, d\xE9\
  cor, etc. It is also possible to find some interesting ateliers, with beautiful\
  \ paintings. The store with most interesting work is Brasileirinho, which has sculptures,\
  \ painting and craftwork from named and anonymous artists. For sightseeing, it is\
  \ easy to admire the colonial constructions as Igreja da Matriz and Chafariz de\
  \ S\xE3o Jos\xE9 and the Largo das Forras, the spot where everything in the town\
  \ happens.\nTiradentes has two interesting kind of restaurants to have lunch: those\
  \ who have local food and the fancy ones. We tried both styles but I would definitely\
  \ recommend the first ones. Eating a real Mineiro lunch, with beans, pork and sausage,\
  \ even being a heavy meal, is a delicious experience. \u201CCacha\xE7a\u201D (alcoholic\
  \ beverage made from sugarcane) is the best drink to have with it. After that, it\
  \ is time to take a nap to recover some energy to join the Carnival parade.\nEverything\
  \ seems to be perfect in Tiradentes\u2019 carnival street party: the small amount\
  \ of people, which allowed us to be close to the musicians; the old streets where\
  \ party happens, which gave an atmosphere of colonial event; the families with beautiful\
  \ kids in their fancy clothes. One thing, however, is preponderant: all blocks are\
  \ thematic and everyone goes dressed accordingly. It is so fun to see the Pallha\xE7\
  ada (Clown) block with kids and parents all dressed like clowns, even using their\
  \ faces painted and drawn. The same happens with Roma foi Pouco (Rome Wasn\u2019\
  t Enough) where everybody is a centurion or a king or a senator. Another interesting\
  \ fact about Tiradentes\u2019 Carnival is that the same musicians play in all blocks\
  \ and to it unpaid. They do it for love and for keeping the tradition alive. By\
  \ the end of the party, it is time to return to the guesthouse, have a good sleep\
  \ to wake up next morning and start everything again."
