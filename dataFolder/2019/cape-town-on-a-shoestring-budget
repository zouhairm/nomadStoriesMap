Text: "I have always been  fascinated with travelling to Cape town and on Christmas\
  \ day 2018 I realised my dream. Thanks to volunteering for the world universities\
  \ debate championships my accommodation and food was covered by the University of\
  \ Cape town. All I had to worry about was travel and personal expenses. \n\nThe\
  \ approach to landing at Cape town international airport sets the whole scene for\
  \ the entire trip its margical. Well magical to me because it was only my third\
  \ flight and first time with landing approach that starts out at sea. \n\nThe airport\
  \ is beautiful and easy to maneuver around and the people are very helpful. There\
  \ are transport options including uber, meter taxis and a local bus service to the\
  \ cbd. \n\nWhen cape town is mentioned \"table mountain\" comes up and to me I thought\
  \ there's not that much mountains there. Only to find out the city is surrounded\
  \ by mountains its so beautiful to view the city from high up like Signal Hill and\
  \ Lions head. \n\nI live in Durban South Africa and we have the Indian ocean here\
  \ which is very warm sea water. I'd heard the Atlantic is cold but no one mentioned\
  \ ice cold to me. I found out for myself when I visited Clifton Beach which almost\
  \ literally froze my feet. Walking away and looking at Cape tonians swimming in\
  \ that water didn't make sense to me, I guess they used to it. \n\nI was lucky enough\
  \ to spot two whales during my time and Clifton Beach and on my next trip to Cape\
  \ town I plan to prioritize whale watching. The sheer size of that mammal is a natural\
  \ phenomenon. \n\nCape town has a bustling night life especially at Long Street\
  \ in the city centre. Was lucky enough to spend my last night in Cape town having\
  \ drinks at the Dubliner an Irish pub. \n\nYou never leave cape town disappointed\
  \ however you leave yourself disappointed by the fact that you didn't have time\
  \ to see it all. I remember talking to my travel buddy that cape town needs a full\
  \ month to full explore the whole city and surrounding areas. Its magical, breath\
  \ taking, beautiful and a natural wonder in my own eyes."
