Text: "As long as I can remember, my drive for success has been pushed by my minds\
  \ imagination to create, thoroughly explore every crevice, and adventure beyond.\
  \ As a kid, my favourite pastime was watching the stars from my backyard and having\
  \ the privilege to grow up in the quaint town of Nuriootpa. South Australia gave\
  \ me that opportunity to see the world from what seemed to be the most distant place\
  \ at the bottom of the southern hemisphere. The world always seemed so spectacular\
  \ from afar, and laying on my trampoline listening to my Mp3 player, I asked myself\
  \ continuous questions. Exploring my mind, I imagined if the stars would appear\
  \ different from the other side of the world? On occasions, I would wonder if I\
  \ were not the only kid sitting, staring at the moon, at that exact moment. The\
  \ sad thing about daydreaming, is time passes quickly and before you know it you\
  \ are twenty-one, three years into a job you hate, but do it to survive. \n\nI use\
  \ to work in retail for a telecommunication company and believe me, technology mixed\
  \ with money, age and education was not the most pleasant of jobs I\u2019ve had.\
  \ Although, I do believe that every challenge in our life is given to us for a purpose.\
  \ Retail gave me the most amazing communication skills - kind of ironic, hey?  So\
  \ like most iconic cliche stories, after a nasty breakup, I started to get re-in\
  \ touch with my childhood dreams and sense of adventure. Not being happy with where\
  \ I was in life, I set myself a goal, I was going to live in Japan. My housemate\
  \ at the time had recently returned from living there for a couple of months. Having\
  \ connections for work over there I applied for a job, a visa; and before I knew\
  \ it my life changed in what seemed to be a day. I quit my job, said goodbye to\
  \ my family and friends and my adventurous soul jumped on a plane on the 1st of\
  \ December, 2017. Being the first time travelling overseas, I had no idea what I\
  \ was getting myself into. So with my camera always in arms reach, I landed in Tokyo\
  \ and set out for a once in a lifetime adventure.\n\nIt was hard to imagine that\
  \ I walked past half my home towns population of five thousand people every time\
  \ pedestrians ran across Shibuya Crossing. Tokyo had me awe; it was fast-paced,\
  \ the people were intriguing, the bright lights were captivating, and finally, I\
  \ felt comfortable in my own skin, surrounded in a city where no one knew my name.\
  \ Tokyo Street photography is what brought me to Japan in the first place; a diverse\
  \ country that has retained its cultural traditions as they adapted with the advanced\
  \ developments of technology and population in the twenty-first century. \n\nSix\
  \ months I lived in Japan, travelling throughout the countryside and major cities.\
  \ I blended into my surroundings by carrying the same values my imagination lead\
  \ me to adventure and explore, listening to music and staring at the stars. Within\
  \ those six months, I began to understand the people, their cultural traditions,\
  \ and their societies. My leap into the unknown was captured through moments of\
  \ time in my mind, and also through my photography."
