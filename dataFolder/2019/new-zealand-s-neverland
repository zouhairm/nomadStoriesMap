Text: "After weeks of planning and packing, I was ready for my first camp as an exchange\
  \ student in New Zealand. It took the class less than two hours to get from Nelson\
  \ to Marahau, a very small fishing town with that lazy beach village vibe and charming\
  \ little houses and the entry to Abel Tasman National Park. There, we split up in\
  \ two groups: half of us would hike, carrying what didn\u2019t fit in the kayaks\
  \ while the rest would paddle through the clearest waters I had ever seen to Apple\
  \ Tree Bay, the deserted beach where we sat on a huge tree trunk laying on the golden\
  \ sand to eat our lunch and swap places. I had started as a paddler, so I walked\
  \ the rest of the way to the campsite at Anchorage Bay. As a Brazilian, I felt quite\
  \ at home seeing the big trees full of green leaves and the breathtaking little\
  \ beaches that appeared in our way unannounced, but I must say all that green subtropical\
  \ vegetation took my German colleagues by surprise and the comments made me laugh.\n\
  The first night was quite calm, so we all went to bed quite early. I remember the\
  \ next morning we made a bet on whoever wore their shoes on the way to or from the\
  \ next beach on the shore had to do the dishes for everyone that night. The little\
  \ rocks trying to make their way into the sole of our feet certainly made the reward\
  \ of getting to Pitt Head a lot more satisfying and, for some reason, we wanted\
  \ more. We jumped off rocks and looked for clam to eat at dinner. At lunch time\
  \ our sore feet took us back to our tents for the meal.\nIn the afternoon, our teacher\
  \ took us to the famous Cleopatra\u2019s pool, a natural pool where you can find\
  \ a natural waterslide through the rocks. Of course the way there was a whole adventure\
  \ itself, specially since we came across a beach flooded with the high tide and\
  \ had to cross it by foot, carrying our bags on our heads and counting the stingrays\
  \ that surrounded us (\u201Cwatch your step\u201D was the most shouted word at this\
  \ time). The pool was beautiful and the sun rays passing through the trees and reflecting\
  \ on the cold water made me feel like there were fairies hidden under every flower\
  \ and behind every rock.\nThat night we watched the most beautiful sunset during\
  \ dinner and competed on who could make the best desert in the woods (the winning\
  \ team made a chocolate mousse using the cold river water as a fridge). Later, we\
  \ walked to little caves to see glow worms. I know, it sounds gross, but it\u2019\
  s actually like seeing the night sky except you know those are actually living things.\
  \ Amazing. Some friends and I decided to sleep outside, by the ocean. The perfect\
  \ setting to stay up late with a German boy looking for shooting stars and talking\
  \ about home.\nWe woke up in a rush, getting ready to leave. I was so done with\
  \ eating porridge, which I hate and was the absolute only thing my group could bring,\
  \ I decided to skip breakfast and get in the kayak. I was already dreaming of a\
  \ bed and, most importantly, a sower. But when you\u2019ve been exercising and not\
  \ eating a lot for two days, skipping a meal isn\u2019t the best idea. Halfway to\
  \ Apple tree Bay, I started feeling like I was going to faint in that kayak. I warned\
  \ everyone and all I remember is  my teacher pulling us fast over the waves. I woke\
  \ up in a small deserted beach, where we stayed until I was well enough to get in\
  \ the water again. My partner swapped places with the German boy from the night\
  \ before and we kept our conversation all the way back, while he paddled and I made\
  \ sure I didn\u2019t pass out.\nLeaving the park was a mixture of emotions. I felt\
  \ like Wendy leaving Neverland, crying for what I may never experience again, but\
  \ craving to be back in the real world."
