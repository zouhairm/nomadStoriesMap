Text: "Ladakh in the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir located at a height of 11,400\
  \ ft. at a distance of almost 434 kms from the state capital, Srinagar has many\
  \ distinctions to its name being one of the coldest deserts in the world representing\
  \ earth's highest ecosystem with stunning views of the world's highest mountains.\n\
  \nThe above information combined with rave reviews from travel enthusiasts was enough\
  \ to propel us to pack our bags to finally scratch this itch of experiencing one\
  \ of the most isolated regions of the world. Although many travellers prefer to\
  \ drive down by car on the almost 3 day route from Manali- Leh covering a distance\
  \ of almost 474 kms we chose instead to save our time and fatigue for Ladakh by\
  \ boarding a flight.\nUpon arrival we were welcomed almost immediately by the anticipated\
  \ cold dry breeze which entered our heads through our nostrils as if censuring us\
  \ for not acclimatising before venturing into this world. Nevertheless, after a\
  \ brief resting bout at the Army guest house at Leh which had spectacular views\
  \ of Stok Kangri, the highest mountain in the Stok Range of the Himalayas in Ladakh\
  \ we ventured as per planned itinerary to explore the magnificent marketplace of\
  \ Leh via a shared auto-rickshaw which is the cheapest way to commute within the\
  \ city. As we meandered deeper into the city towards the bazaar it had this definitive\
  \ feel of the Tibetan influence on the way of life in Leh considering that the the\
  \ populace mostly comprises of Buddhists followed by Hindus & Muslims forming a\
  \ minority. The charming bazaar was filled with Tibetan handicraft items including\
  \ Buddhist masks, Thangka paintings, traditional Ladakhi jewelery, dry fruits etc.\
  \ At the same time in order to cater to a larger audience, it has built up a generous\
  \ stock of delectable bakery confectioners, restaurants & bars offering a variety\
  \ of cosmopolitan gourmet cuisines. Immediately above the marketplace is the Leh\
  \ Palace which is a former royal palace built by King Sennge Namgyal in the 16th\
  \ century modelled on the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet. Based on suggestions from\
  \ locals we hired a motorcycle to explore the breathtaking landscape of barren mountains\
  \ on smooth roads neatly maintained by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO).\n\n\
  \ Ladakh is open for tourists only for 5 months (May-Sept) after which the area\
  \ gets snowed out with temperatures dipping to minus 30 degrees celsius. Soon we\
  \ chanced upon river rafting, also the highest in the world on Zanskar river after\
  \ a brief visit to Magnetic Hill which filled our need for an adrenaline pumping\
  \ activity. The following days involved us paying visits to the Nubra Valley through\
  \ the perennially snowbound Khardungla, the highest motorable pass in the world\
  \ situated at an elevation of 5,602 metres above sea level. After travelling for\
  \ a considerable 6 hours, we stumbled upon village Hunder through Diskit, the capital\
  \ of Nubra valley which had the most picturesque landscape bestowed with sun-kissed\
  \ sand dunes under a clear blue sky being traversed upon by double humped Bactrian\
  \ camels complimented by Nubra river flowing by its side & army choppers flying\
  \ towards Siachen glacier, the world's highest battlefield. Enjoying our sumptuous\
  \ dinner at a Ladakhi kitchen & interaction with hospitable locals became the highlight\
  \ of our sojourn to the Nubra valley. The penultimate day of our journey led us\
  \ to the unmissable Pangong Tso lake via Agham Shyok road from Nubra after driving\
  \ on uncharted river beds and potholed roads for approximately 6 hours. Pangong\
  \ Tso is a 130 km long lake extending from India to China & is situated at a height\
  \ of 4350 metres in the Changthang region of Ladakh. Settled aside the grandeur\
  \ of the saline lake changing its colour from green to blue as per the wishes of\
  \ the sun inspired me to put down my thoughts on paper on the ephemerality of life.\
  \ We managed time to visit the striking Hemis monastery through the Chang La pass\
  \ from Pangong Tso enroute Leh.\n\nThis ultimate jaunt marked an end to an inspirational\
  \ journey laying a compelling narrative to manifest the splendour of Leh & Ladakh\
  \ for in the words of George Orwell, \" Beauty is meaningless until it is shared.\""
