Text: "Last August my boyfriend and I started a backpacking trip through Southeast\
  \ Asia, we left everything familiar (our jobs, our house), we sold pretty much all\
  \ of our belongings and we just went for it. We travel for 5 months and visited\
  \ 5 countries (Singapore, Malasya, Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam), it was and out\
  \ of this world experience and the best thing we could possibly do. \nWe learned\
  \ a lot, about ourselves, about our relationship, about countries that seemed completely\
  \ foreign to us but in reality had so much more in common that we thought. \nWe\
  \ were able to open our lives and our mind to new experience, challenging experiences\
  \ and we discover a different way of life. Most of the people we met are ones that\
  \ we will remember forever because of the time spent with them and for the teachings\
  \ they gave us. \nWe went looking for the path, for answers and we found more questions,\
  \ the path is still to be discover, but all we found in those five months was overwhelmingly\
  \ true and passionate. \nAnd right now we are in a new challenge, the what\u2019\
  s next part of this trip, the how to keep going, how to live off the backpack and\
  \ how to find a way to do it again."
