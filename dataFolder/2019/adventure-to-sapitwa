Text: "So there I was one day, with my friends and extremely bored. It seemed as if\
  \ we had exhausted all the adventures in our city of Blantyre, we needed to expand\
  \ our horizons, see other places in the Warm Heart of Africa. The only problem was,\
  \ we did not know where to start.\n\nMalawi as a country has many places that offer\
  \ the thrill of adventure, it has a beautiful Lake, humble but, breath taking the\
  \ Mountains and amazing scenery. It was a very had choice. After much deliberation,\
  \ we settled on Mulanje.\n\nMulanje has many attractive sites but, the one, that\
  \ grabs the fancy of most is the mountain with its peak called Sapitwa. Many myths\
  \ and legends are told about the peak and the mountain itself, about how ghosts\
  \ and spirits roam the mountain seeking to take anyone who dares trek the forbidden\
  \ sites of the peak, about mer-people in the pools that are on the mountain, it\
  \ felt like something, that would start our adventures into the unknown parts of\
  \ our home country. \n\nSo, we decided to pack for a two week journey, get into\
  \ the car we called our Adventure Mobile (very clich\xE9) and drive. We did not\
  \ know how to get there, all we knew was from our current location, all we had to\
  \ do was head south. \n\nWe drove towards Thyolo were most of the tea estates were\
  \ located, it is a rather cold place with very interesting and friendly  people,\
  \ we stopped in the Estates and took some breathtaking photos and had a few laughs,\
  \ then continued our journey. \n\nWe had many stops, some unforgettable, others\
  \ unforeseen but, we had many laughs heading to our destination. After a  day of\
  \ travel, we arrived. Technically the trip would have taken anyone hours but, we\
  \ had many stops and many misadventures because we didn't know where to go. \n\n\
  Our plan for the trip was to hike to the top and get to experience Sapitwa by ourselves.\
  \ We asked around and the locals told us that it is close to a three day hike for\
  \ people of our experience. We found a tour guide and we begun hiking up the mountain.\
  \ The mountain had amazing cascading waterfalls, diverse wild life and vegetation,\
  \ it was a site to behold, we found spaces where we could camp for the night and\
  \ tell stories about the ghosts roaming the mountain, as in whether they would take\
  \ one of us or not. \n\nWe finally reached the peak and the view was just breathtaking,\
  \ it was like standing in the clouds, the air was moist and it was freezing cold.\
  \ Unfortunately, no ghosts were encountered on this journey but, I am really glad\
  \ that our first journey into the unknown, started with the peak called Sapitwa."
