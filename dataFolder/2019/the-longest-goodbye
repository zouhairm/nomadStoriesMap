Text: "I went back to Stonegarth looking for the strength to leave it. \n\tStonegarth\
  \ was my mother\u2019s childhood home. My own childhood was spent mostly on the\
  \ other side of the world, but always it came back to Stonegarth. Wherever I went,\
  \ however far I travelled, Stonegarth \u2013 solid, safe, familiar, unchanging \u2013\
  \ was always there, in the background, waiting for me to return. And always I did\
  \ return, and loved it more each time.\n\tStonegarth sits just outside unlovely\
  \ Blackburn, up in the north-west of England. Under a hard grey sky, Lancashire\
  \ is bleak country; its hills and woods are stark and strong, not those of the picturesque\
  \ Lake District just further north. But to me it is the loveliest place in the world;\
  \ and when the sun is shining, lighting on the hills and touching the trees in the\
  \ valley, swallows flying high and black against the vault of the wide blue sky\
  \ above, it is pure heaven.\n\tLast March I returned for the last time. My grandfather\
  \ was dying; after his death the house would be sold. On a bleak spring day, the\
  \ newly shorn lambs shivering cruelly in the frosty fields, the cutting wind whipping\
  \ tears unbidden, I came back to start saying goodbye.\n\tSeven months it took.\
  \ As my grandfather slipped away from life, I watched life change about me in the\
  \ passage of the seasons. There was snow through to April that year, freezing fog\
  \ often shrouding the house, the garden, the wood behind, the field in front, and\
  \ the brooding, ever-present hills all around. Then suddenly overnight winter leapt\
  \ into late spring. The fog vanished into a clear blue sky, bluebells carpeted the\
  \ woods, hawthorn in the hedgerows blossomed into joyful splendour. \n\tThat was\
  \ a golden, glorious summer. The house drowsed, day after long day, in unending\
  \ heat. I swam for hours in the garden\u2019s pool, up and down, exulting in the\
  \ blue and white sky high overhead. I roamed for miles over the countryside, the\
  \ earth that had squelched beneath my feet in March now baked hard and dry. On top\
  \ of the Yellow Hills I stood, so many times, to watch the late sun grace the other\
  \ hills \u2013 Mellor, Pendle, Longridge Fell, their names and forms as familiar\
  \ to me as my own \u2013 before sinking in a great blazing ball of fire down beneath\
  \ the distant silver sea.\n\tThe day my grandfather died, the day Stonegarth was\
  \ lost to me forever, was fair and clear and lovely, perfection encompassing heartbreak.\
  \ By the time of the funeral, a month later, damp grey mist was swirling again around\
  \ the house and rain advancing from over the hills, ushering in September's Keatsian\
  \ mellow fruitfulness. In the hedgerows, where the hawthorn berries flashed scarlet\
  \ in the hedges and dew-diamond cobwebs draped the twigs, I scavenged for blackberries,\
  \ hauling home far more than we could eat, fingers stained purple and hands blotched\
  \ with nettle rash.\n\tI left forever early on an achingly beautiful autumn morning,\
  \ crisp and chilly, the bright sun forbidding tears. But in the front room where\
  \ my grandfather had died, with its wide window looking out over the hills blue\
  \ in the distance, I sobbed and sobbed. And then we drove away, down tiny Woodgates\
  \ Lane marked at the edges with white stones, down Billinge End Road, round the\
  \ corners and down steep Cabin Hill, round again and up into the little village\
  \ of Pleasington. And there, for the first time in all those seven months, the door\
  \ of the church stood open. We slipped inside to kneel before the Blessed Virgin;\
  \ and somewhere deep down beneath my heavy mourning a tiny flicker of light struggled\
  \ into flame. I had done what I had come to do; I had made my peace. And we went\
  \ on, driving lanes well familiar, never to be forgotten; then on to ways only partially\
  \ known; then finally to roads completely strange to me, heading down towards the\
  \ south, the airport, and the unknown."
