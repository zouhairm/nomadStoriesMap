Text: "I crossed the busy Chinese street in a hurry. As usual, it was a hot and humid\
  \ day, and I was running late for class. Although students in this class were routinely\
  \ late, it was different for me. I was the teacher. \nUp the marble stairs, past\
  \ the fish tank, down the hall, turn right. With a minute to spare, I entered the\
  \ classroom as the previous teacher, a Ukrainian woman named Ella, gathered her\
  \ things. We exchanged a quick hello as she threw on her jean jacket. \n\u201CHeat\
  \ index of 104. I\u2019ll never understand that jacket,\u201D I thought to myself\
  \ as I shook my head and walked into the classroom. I greeted my students: six bright-eyed,\
  \ Chinese fourth graders. We only met once a week on Saturdays, and this was our\
  \ eighth class. As they settled into the assignment, I heard strong footsteps just\
  \ outside the door.\nWhere minutes ago there had been a slender woman in a jean\
  \ jacket, there was now a large, intimidating Chinese man in a police uniform. The\
  \ little red light of a body camera blinked incriminatingly and then a camcorder\
  \ appeared, held by a second, smaller man.\n\u201CIs this your classroom? Are you\
  \ their teacher?\u201D the first man demanded in nearly perfect English. My heart\
  \ started beating fanatically as I wracked my brain, wondering why they were here.\
  \ \u201CYes,\u201D I stated. \u201CThis is my class.\u201D I tried to sound confident,\
  \ tried to act as if I had done nothing wrong. My students stared.\n\u201CWhen does\
  \ it end?\u201D the officer asked. The camcorder was still pointed at my face as\
  \ the second man said nothing, staring at the little screen in his hand. \u201C\
  It just started. It ends in an hour,\u201D I stammered. My words seem to weakly\
  \ hang in the air as the man\u2019s gaze pierced through my previous confidence.\
  \ Was it only two minutes ago that my biggest worry was the stifling heat?\n\u201C\
  You may teach your class. But don\u2019t leave,\u201D the officer commanded as they\
  \ left the room. I peered through the window and saw Ella, standing with the campus\
  \ director and the police. I had hoped she was already gone, but, shamefully, was\
  \ thankful I wasn\u2019t going to be alone.\nThe hour dragged on. To my knowledge,\
  \ teaching this class was legal. I was in China to teach full time- my work visa\
  \ was sponsored by a school that encouraged us to teach extra classes for their\
  \ friends. Everyone knew someone who was in the English teaching business, and it\
  \ was a lucrative one. \nThe class finally ended and I said goodbye to the students.\
  \ My brain hardly registered their cadence of \u201CGoodbye, Teacher!\u201D as I\
  \ saw them skip out the door for the last time.\nThe English speaking officer and\
  \ camcorder officer were waiting. \u201CWe can do this the easy way, or the hard\
  \ way,\u201D the officer said. Later I would wonder if he learned his English from\
  \ American movies. \nWe sat on a padded pleather sofa in the hallway as the officer\
  \ spelled out our crimes. \u201CYou are not allowed to teach anywhere that does\
  \ not sponsor your work visa\u2026You have broken Chinese law\u2026You need to go\
  \ to the police station to make a statement\u2026If you don\u2019t go, you will\
  \ have problems at the border\u2026.\u201D   My mind flipped back and forth between\
  \ the words he said and my senses, heightened under the unexpected pressure. \u201C\
  This sofa is sticking to my legs\u2026 my student\u2019s mom just walked by, did\
  \ she recognize me?\u2026 Ella\u2019s eyes look hollow, I wonder what she\u2019\
  s thinking\u2026\u201D\nTuesday. We were supposed to go to the police station on\
  \ Tuesday. We would make a statement and pay a fine. \u201CPlease don\u2019t avoid\
  \ this. It will not be good for you,\u201D the officer reiterated. Finally, we were\
  \ free to leave. \nThe Chinese government has my statement. And my fine. And my\
  \ mug shot, and my fingerprints, and even a swab of my DNA. Two months later I stood\
  \ in line at passport control with my luggage. An icy blast from the air conditioner\
  \ hit me as I swung my own jean jacket across my shoulders, heard the thud of a\
  \ passport stamp, and walked across the border."
