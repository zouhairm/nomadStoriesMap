Text: "As a foreigner living in Japan, I have always had this very careful, shy relationship\
  \ with its unique culture. A kind of relationship that made me use the fork instead\
  \ of the chopsticks whenever I had the chance to, despite knowing how to use them.\
  \ It made me appreciate some kinds of the Japanese food or \u201Cwashoku\u201D \
  \ but always go for western food that doesn't take time or effort to understand\
  \ or actually love. Most importantly it made me one of those foreigners who only\
  \ see Japan that lies in the multi-cultural, foreigners-friendly Tokyo where you\
  \ can be amazed by the lights of \u201CAkihabara\u201D, the anime lovers' district,\
  \ the fancy clubs of \u201CRoppongi\u201D and the charm of \u201CShibuya\u201D where\
  \ foreigners always take videos for their moments walking through the famous, always\
  \ crowded shibuya crossing\n I realized the kind of fear I had every time I tried\
  \ to approach the real culture of Japan as a foreigner when I rejected a friend's\
  \ invitation to go to a Buddhist temple in the new year's eve  and preferred to\
  \ see the  new year's countdown in \u201CShibuya\u201D where people gathered and\
  \ celebrated. It seemed to me that getting close to the real pure aspects of a culture\
  \ is a very hard mission because it forces you to get out of your comfort zone where\
  \ everything you know lies and puts you face to face with your ability to try, to\
  \ adapt and to embrace new experiences that show you how amazingly diverse this\
  \ world is. For this reason I decided to get out of my comfort zone and approach\
  \ \u201Creal Japan\u201D by staying for three nights in a Buddhist temple in \u201C\
  Shizouka\u201D prefecture where mount Fuji is. \n  Arriving at the temple in the\
  \ evening, my heartbeats were racing out of excitement and fear. The monk welcomed\
  \ me and my two friends and he took us to the main hall of the temple where he was\
  \ introducing three Muslim girls coming from the other side of the world to \u201C\
  Buddha\u201D who was lying in the big portrait on the wall and telling him that\
  \ we are to stay in his temple for three days and we sincerely bowed with the monk\
  \ for a few seconds that were enough to make two mutually exclusive religious culture\
  \ find a few threads of connection that helped make those three days unforgettable.\
  \ The monk kindly showed us around the temple that looked like a maize to us. He\
  \ told us the story of Buddha, translated the beautiful Japanese characters written\
  \ on the walls and took us to many countries across the globe in just two hours\
  \ that we spent listening to his endless stories about the many countries he's been\
  \ to. In two hours we could learn about the Persian civilization, the cities of\
  \ India and the music of Spain. We then were guided to the room we'd sleep in. Never\
  \ in my dreams had I thought that I could spend a night in a temple that looked\
  \ like  fantasy or like one of the \u201Canimes\u201D I used to watch as a kid when\
  \ I fell in love with Japan the first time. We could sleep in a purely \u201Cwashitsu\u201D\
  \ or a Japanese room where the floor was covered with traditional rice straw- made\
  \ mats called \u201Ctatami\u201D and slept in the amazingly comfortable traditional\
  \ Japanese beds or \u201Cfuton\u201D. The next morning we could meet the monk's\
  \ son who had this amazingly strange cultural mix of traditional monk appearance,\
  \ a shaved head along with fluent English and a foreign background that mixes with\
  \ his Japanese roots. He was just a human version of current Japan that keeps the\
  \ beauty of its traditions along with the outstanding modernity and the international\
  \ touch. \n The warmth of those three days, the endless discussions of  cultures,\
  \ histories and all that makes us humans and the direct confrontation between me\
  \ and all my fears including \u201Cwashoku\u201D, chopsticks and Japanese language\
  \ made me finally feel connected and totally immersed with no fear or reservations.\
  \ I took the beautiful memories of the temple back with me to Tokyo where I am still\
  \ a foreigner but a one who is rather more open, less afraid and strongly attached"
