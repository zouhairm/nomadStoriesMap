Text: "The shrill tone from the hotel phone lying on the table, roused me from  slumber.\
  \  It was 5:35 a.m. and in the dimly lit tent, I could make out the half spent bottle\
  \ of Sweedish vodka and lime wedges sitting on a saucer beside the oddly shaped\
  \ glasses. \nThe details from the previous day came slowly to me, as I gently edged\
  \ out of the camp mattress trying not to startle my companion as I picked up the\
  \ phone. \n\nThis was a dream come true and it started about five years ago, when\
  \ I made an online friend from Kenya. Her name was Nily Shanoa and she was a member\
  \ and contributor of the Lemo Lodge an online platform for African writers. We shared\
  \ common interest obviously from her profile and that was how our friendship began.\
  \ \n\nWe got to know each other and over time, expressed our desires to travel the\
  \ world, knowing more about the diverse cultures and traditions. These discussions\
  \ grew from chats to emails, text messages and calls which effectively closed the\
  \ miles that kept us apart.\nThrough five Christmases we kept in touch, while hoping\
  \ to meet up someday.\nOne faithful August, our wish came true when I decided to\
  \ pay Nily a visit.  I took a week off my annual vacation, booking a five day safari\
  \ at the Maasai Mara for two with Nily's assistance. She screamed on the phone when\
  \ she heard this and volunteered to help make the trip worth the while.\nIt was\
  \ a sunny afternoon when our flight touched down at the Jomo Kenyatta International\
  \ Airport.  The check-in at the immigration was a quick one all thanks to my E.C.O.W.A.S.\
  \ Passport.\nI turned around to leave the area when I encountered with a pair of\
  \ lovely eyes in the crowd. It was unmistakably Nily's. She was an exact replica\
  \ of her online photos. She tried to hold herself from screaming while we embraced.\
  \ We had so much to say but the time was brief and so we headed for the rail station\
  \ from where we took a passenger train for Narok county.\n\nThe voice of our tour\
  \ guide greeted me over the phone. He informed me to be ready in forty minutes to\
  \ meet up with the game drive schedule for the day.\nAn orange streak of light had\
  \ begun to part the skies, separating the blankets of night and ushering in the\
  \ new day. \nWe arrived the muster point and interacted with other tourists who\
  \ came from different parts of the world for the safari experience.\nThis was my\
  \ first time in the wild and so close to nature. The sight of impala herds, blue\
  \ wildebeest, zebras, elephants and lions was a hair raising one.\nAn aerial view\
  \ of the reserve in a hot air balloon and the journey across the crocodile infested\
  \ Mara river was indeed breathtaking. \nWe took close-up photographs of the scenery\
  \ and interacted with some native Maasai who were in the area. They told us somewhat\
  \ about their history and even performed a dance called adumu for us while we joined\
  \ in clapping our hands in rhythm.\nAt dinner, we had a variety of local relish\
  \ such as mahami, chapati with vegetables, ugali and sukuma with an assortment of\
  \ meat and fish.\nAfter our meal, we took a walk to a knoll by the line of cane\
  \ tree and sat down on the grass watching the world retire. \nI stole a glance at\
  \ Nily who was as calm as the scenery and She looked beautiful in her flowery gown.\n\
  Gently I placed my arm around her and she looked up at me with a smile while placing\
  \ her head on my shoulder."
