Text: "\u201CA leap into the unknown\u201D, that is my definition of hitchhiking.\
  \ It is the step into open space, unexplored and undiscovered, frightening and exciting\
  \ at the same time. It is a fresh start every time I am in a new car.\nIn Mongolia,\
  \ I felt the same. I had just crossed the border, and some local slackers waved\
  \ to me. They were sitting and drinking moonshine at the grass under a big tree.\
  \ \u201COK\u201D, I said to myself while I approached. Anyway, I needed a ride and\
  \ I hoped that these gentlemen will help me with this. Also, I had a small but very\
  \ significant problem, I didn\u2019t know any words in Mongolian and it could have\
  \ been useful to learn a couple of words because it was obvious to me that people\
  \ at the border can act as translators. Oh, how was I mistaken!\nWhen I sat near,\
  \ they show a bottle and invite me to drink. I declined such a generous proposition.\
  \ The road has its own rules and one of them is straight as a highway and strict\
  \ as a road sign: \u201CDo not drink\u201D. They seemed as much upset as surprised,\
  \ they couldn't imagine that a Russian can say \u201Cno\u201D to alcohol. So, they\
  \ started to ask me questions in Mongolian, which was a problem and when I requested\
  \ to change the language all I got was a set of sounds. I got pretty much upset,\
  \ but I tried my luck once again. I showed them the map of a region while asking\
  \ how to reach the nearest village. And I was really surprised. Using gestures they\
  \ showed me that there are no buses at this area, also that, there is a very minor\
  \ possibility that any car will appear here today. However, as much as I understood,\
  \ they were living nearby and would be glad to give me a ride. I remembered my bad\
  \ experience on the Russian side of the border and showed them that I\u2019m as\
  \ poor as a church-mouse. This message caused a burst of laughter and I was very\
  \ calm getting in the back of the truck. They seemed to be very pleasant people.\
  \ \nWe drove about three hours straight through the steppe. Infinite green land\
  \ without trees or bushes was surrounding me until the horizon. My eyes on the other\
  \ side, were familiarized with a different type of landscape. Forests, hills, mountains\
  \ and I felt unusual, however, an incredible sense of adventure was remaining inside.\
  \ Everywhere I looked was so extraneous, so unreal that I could hardly believe that\
  \ I\u2019m awake.  It was the first time in my life I was so far from home, alone\
  \ in a wild foreign country, but feeling truly alive and experiencing real happiness.\n\
  We arrived into a very small village, about 30 houses only. The owner, one-handed\
  \ fellow, invited me to drink, but I was so tired that immediately inquired for\
  \ a place to sleep. He showed me the corner of the house and I fell asleep the minute\
  \ I got into my sleeping bag. I woke up in the middle of a night, a bright light\
  \ was right in my eyes. One-handed guy was standing above me. Damn! I got really\
  \ scared. He screamed and I noticed that he is very drunk. I didn\u2019t know what\
  \ to do, he seemed extremely angry and aggressive. The last thing I needed was a\
  \ fight, so I tried to calm him down, but I couldn\u2019t understand any word he\
  \ was yelling. Suddenly he took my bag, trying to throw it away. However, it was\
  \ super heavy, usually I have a lot of stuff and weight can rise over 20 kilos,\
  \ of course with a one hand he couldn't lift it. His behavior completely freaked\
  \ me out. I said a bunch of bad Russian words very loud and apparently it really\
  \ worked! He turned back and left the room.\nIn the morning he seemed very ashamed.\
  \ Before I left the village I asked him to write down something in my notepad. And\
  \ surprisingly only four months later when I got home I could translate his message.\
  \ He wrote: \"Good luck, Russian bear\"."
