Text: "Arriving in India felt horrifying. I\u2019d been traveling around now for 5\
  \ years and most of it solo. I\u2019d done a lot of Asia, Canada and the U.S, but\
  \ India was a whole other can of worms. There\u2019d been three times when I\u2019\
  d organised to book a flight to India but plans and life had pushed me in another\
  \ other direction. \n\nMy British boyfriend James and I had just recently driven\
  \ around Australia and lived out of our van for 8 months. We only met around 8 months\
  \ ago so I guess it was a good way to seal the deal. \nWe were living in such close\
  \ quaters, side by side every day, and now I was about to leave my best friend.\
  \ It was an extremely daunting feeling... But I arrived in Goa feeling more calmly\
  \ that I had envisioned. My idea was to make some jewellery and do lots of yoga.\
  \ I love making jewellery, seeing ones creativity come to life is very exciting\
  \ for me and I wanted to learn more about the entire process. \nMy friend who I\
  \ was staying with recommended a jeweller to me that was only 10mins scooter ride\
  \ away. The first time I saw Farooq\u2019s shop I thought, \u201Coh how quaint!\u201D\
  . I walked in and introduced myself. Farooq was a very straight faced man around\
  \ the age of 40. Now, if you know me and my character you\u2019ll know that whenever\
  \ I come across a stern looking man I will always try to make them smile. Farooq\
  \ took only a few minutes to warm up to and by the end of it we were high fiving,\
  \ although I\u2019m not sure if he enjoyed that part.\n \nI sat there for a few\
  \ days working on some designs and realised how much of a process it is from start\
  \ to finish. No modern machines here - all manual labor. \n\nOver the next few days\
  \ I felt like I had a lot on my mind. At this stage it had been 2 weeks since I\u2019\
  d arrived in Goa. I was enjoying my time but I was also thinking a lot about the\
  \ future. James and I had just travelled around Australia. I was due to fly to England\
  \ after my stint in India and was figuring out how I could earn money in the UK\
  \ when my working visa was still in the process of being approved. \nI called James\
  \ and told him how much I was enjoying making jewellery and traveling around India\
  \ but concerned about not being able to work in UK because of the delay in my application.\
  \ He replied and said, \u201Cwhy don\u2019t you start a jewellery business?\u201D\
  . \nI\u2019d thought of this idea so many times before... I mean thousands of times.\
  \ But it never felt right. But in this exact moment, such a leap into the unknown\
  \ - it felt right. James & I talked furthermore, weighing up the pros and cons.\
  \ I was in the perfect place and with so much inspiration around me. I was spending\
  \ a total of 2 months in India which would be enough time to make the designs, samples\
  \ and the get some limited pieces made. It all made sense. \n\nI was at Farooq\u2019\
  s making some earrings one day when I met a girl named Iona who was also taking\
  \ a class with Farooq. She was from London and we chatted together easily as though\
  \ we\u2019d known each other in a previous life. She asked if she could see what\
  \ I was making. I showed her the pair of my fourth design of earrings that I had\
  \ no name for yet. She picked them up in her hand, looked at them closely and said,\
  \ \u201Coh if you\u2019re making a few of these can I buy a pair before I leave?\u201D\
  . \n\nI smiled from ear to ear. I didn\u2019t expect to find myself become a business\
  \ woman while sitting on the floor at a jewellers in India and drinking chai."
