Text: "Being a dreamer is so good. You get to experience the best adventures, watch\
  \ movies which haven't yet been produced and visit places, which you have never\
  \ heard of. That's what I do. I dream and then plan to execute them because of my\
  \ belief that dreams are a manifestation of the reality. Many a times I dreamt that\
  \ I have landed from a chopper to a place where people are happily gardening. I\
  \ couldn't afford a chopper though, so I booked myself a train ticket to Kotdwara,\
  \ a small village in Uttarakhand- The Land of Cherubs. \nI reached there on a beautiful\
  \ morning of the flowering season, at Six in the morning. The first noticeable thing\
  \ was that the railway station was built by chiseling the mountains! As I walked\
  \ through the wiggly roads, I saw that there were fresh water channels built alongside\
  \ the roads. There was cold breeze, pink sunlight and big flowers popping out of\
  \ every house. All the houses looked the same- square shaped, a small rooftop, a\
  \ little garden at the entrance and some cattle or a pet dog. Only the colors were\
  \ different. The walls were so low that I could easily see people carrying buckets\
  \ to bathe their cattle or the dogs trying to catch butterflies. That was cute.\
  \ After walking for an hour while cherishing the sound of the birds and morning\
  \ prayers, I stopped by a residential colony where there were a few women weaving\
  \ and chitchatting. I greeted them and asked if I could get a hotel somewhere to\
  \ spend the night. They handed me a cup of tea to my question, started asking about\
  \ my education and what brought me to that small place. I do not honestly remember,\
  \ when did I become a part of their group from where I was answering their basic\
  \ inquiries. They took me on a long walk to the temples. Some were built on the\
  \ foothills with the Ganges' water flowing besides and some were in caves with bats\
  \ hanging at the ceiling! After our small spiritual tour to the village, we headed\
  \ back to the place where we had started. The kids had also returned from the schools.\
  \ After changing, they took me for a trek to the mountains. The starting point was\
  \ a luscious jungle. The moment I saw it, I was full of lust to enter it and touch\
  \ every creature inside. They asked me not to go too deep in there because of the\
  \ wild animals, so I just looked at the monkeys hurdling from one branch to the\
  \ other and baby monkeys being petted by their mothers. I got out of it, but the\
  \ aroma still was tantalizing. We caught a route to the mountains and trekked. On\
  \ our way, we saw a lot of wild flowers and beautiful migratory and local birds,\
  \ which I had never seen before. There were creepers, shrubs, vines and eye-catching\
  \ butterflies. It was simply like heaven! After a green patch came a a spring of\
  \ water, where we sat down, played some Pahaadi music on the portable speaker and\
  \ had tea and noodles. The kids were so fearless that they picked up white baby\
  \ crabs on their palms! This joy, I could not find in the most luxurious palaces\
  \ of India. We spotted a herd of elephant moving towards the spring, while we were\
  \ walking down to the village again. We reached back the village at seven in the\
  \ evening. Jumping, dancing, singing and laughing. The kids happily hugged me as\
  \ we reached back to the colony. Everyone asked me to stay the night with them,\
  \ but I chose the youngest member from my little trek group. He lived in a cottage\
  \ with his parents, a younger brother  (eight months old), an elder sister (twelve\
  \ years old), grandmother, a cow and a calf. That eight months old child had started\
  \ recognizing me by my voice! They all invited me for his first birthday, and trust\
  \ me, as I am writing this, I can still breathe the same fragrance of the woods,\
  \ simplicity and love of that air. I would call it a treasure for this life."
