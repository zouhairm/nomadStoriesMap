Text: "I look around, and I saw people in a hurry. A lot of people walking, taking\
  \ photos, talking loud, standing in lines. For a while I paralyzed, looked up, and\
  \ I was suddenly stunned. The construction appeared to be very high.  The day was\
  \ hotter than normal, and the sun was blinding me. I took my ticket and my audio\
  \ guide, so I put my headphone and turned me off from the world. I was visiting\
  \ \"La Sagrada Familia\", in Barcelona.\n\nAfter the ratchets, across the gate,\
  \ I felt so sad. I thought about how this church had become just a tourist spot,\
  \ where this people was not there to pray and concect with God anymore. It is not\
  \ for less, this church is the place that receives the most tourists from all over\
  \ Spain. However, when I got in the church, i realized suddenly I was in front of\
  \ the most beautiful church that I had never already seen before. The light passing\
  \ through the stained glass made me feel in the sky. The richness of each detail,\
  \ each piece in its proper place, each part that made the whole immensity so wonderful.\
  \ The church is not finished yet, despite that, all the details were thought accurately\
  \ and with great sensitivity in the eyes of faith. \n\nIn the church I could see\
  \ many people, perhaps not even believe in God, but who were hearing about all the\
  \ details of the sanctuary, corresponding the life of Jesus. Hearing a little of\
  \ God... Gaud\xED, the architect of the place, worked for the last years of his\
  \ life in the job and construction of the church. One of the phrases he said was\
  \ that he wanted \"every space in the temple as a syllable of a collective prayer.\"\
  \ Yes, I believe he succeeded."
