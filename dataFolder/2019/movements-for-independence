Text: "This story begins as any other thing in life... while doing something completely\
  \ different. I was on my 3th Erasmus, this time in Madrid working in a Law firm\
  \ when I recieved an email that I was awarded a scholarship to do a research on\
  \ Populism in Europe supported by the Scharzkopf Foundation. it was a dream come\
  \ true, because it would give me the opportunity to travel by my self through Europe,\
  \ on a trip I planned and carried out at the end. I decided to put as a subtopic:\
  \ Movements for Independence in Europe because I feel pationate about this topic\
  \ and it was and it is still an important one. \nMonths later I was still in Madrid\
  \ but I wasn't working anymore. This time the Spanish capital was my starting point\
  \ from where I was traveling constantly to Catalonia and Velencia regions taking\
  \ interviews from politicians. \nThe first interview I have been given have taken\
  \ place in the Spanish Congress where I could feel like one of the 400 MP while\
  \ talking with the representative of ERC (Esquerra Republicana) about why Catalonia\
  \ wants indepence. The leftist MP draw my attention on the democratic values Catalans\
  \ pursued by their movement and the desire for change. Thus the indepence was seen\
  \ as a liberation and rewriting what they esteem unfair Constitution."
