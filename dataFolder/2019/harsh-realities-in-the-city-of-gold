Text: "In an air-conditioned car, safe from the 39 degree heat and oppressive humidity,\
  \ my father, an expatriate, points at a group of men by the road, uniformly dressed\
  \ in blue jumpsuits. \"Migrant workers,\" he says. \"You'll see them everywhere.\"\
  \n\nI will admit that I entered Dubai with a certain set of expectations. The City\
  \ of Gold, as it is sometimes called, is a place that the world has come to associate\
  \ with wealth and prosperity. Since the first oil was found in 1966, Dubai has grown\
  \ into a veritable playground for millionaires. Where else in the can you find ski\
  \ slopes in the middle of the desert or visit the highest viewing platform on the\
  \ tallest building in the world?\n\nAs my father drives us into the city, I stare\
  \ at the skyscrapers, some still in construction, all shining in the desert sun.\
  \ It is like peeling back layers: as we drive further, the sand haze reveals more\
  \ and more. \n\nDubai has a way of making you feel rich just by being in it. Dubai\
  \ Mall is full of expensive boutiques, with a whole section of the shopping centre\
  \ seemingly dedicated to designer children's clothing. Luxury cars roam the streets\
  \ and the architecture is modern and eye-catching. Even the locals' traditional\
  \ attire - men's white kanduras and women's black abayas - are covered in delicate,\
  \ gold embroidery.\n\nBut in between the 5-star restaurants (and the 7-star hotel),\
  \ jumpsuit-clad workers slave away in the heat. \n\n\"Most people learn to ignore\
  \ them,\" my father tells me, and I wonder if I would have, too, had he not pointed\
  \ them out. \n\nI learn about how they live - labour camps, squalor, barely scraping\
  \ by and still sending money home to their families. About how, far too often, a\
  \ migrant will jump from one of the beautiful, shimmering skyscrapers and nobody\
  \ will bat an eye.\n\nAt one point, we pull over and offer one of the workers a\
  \ bottle of water. When we roll down the car window, the heat and humidity hits\
  \ us like a wall. I begin to feel exhausted within a minute. The man had been working\
  \ all day.\n\nThe official tourism motto for the United Arab Emirates is \"Discover\
  \ all that's possible\". Unfortunately, there is rarely a thought spared for those\
  \ who are worked and neglected to make it possible."
