Text: "When you accepted yourself as you really are, then you see that is very difficult\
  \ trying to fit in, but then you reallized that once you accept your reality is\
  \ so easy to see the things that really matters in life and you lose all the fears\
  \ and then you dare to explore beyond looking for happiness. \nI dare to fell in\
  \ love once to a girl who claims to searchin for love no mather who the person was\
  \ boy or girl, we spend so much time and so much life togheter with ups and downs\
  \ but our love grow so much that my heart fell in in a little time. \nOne day her\
  \ heart decided that was time to kiss me and she did, i felt the most happy girl\
  \ in the world, but soon as it happens, her brain say that it was to much to risk,\
  \ and then she goes away. \nI was looking for something to help me to recovery the\
  \ willing to live and to feel again, so left all behind, my friends, my family,\
  \ my work and took a plane to the country of laughs, i was all by myself to the\
  \ other side of the world, and as the days pased by I learn about budism, to meditation,\
  \ and the most important that you have yourself to love, to take care and to be\
  \ with. \nWe always tought about love as other person, but thailand showed me that\
  \ love is everywhere, you just have to pay attention and life will surprised you.\
  \ \nLove is there waiting for you to see it to dare to accepted no matter what,\
  \ but first you have to lear to love yourself and enjoy the little things of life,\
  \ dare to be you and never let that somewhone else took away your light, your life\
  \ or you heart.\nI realized now that to take a flight to the adventure, to Reset\
  \ your life, and to take a risks is always good because you win a lot of experiences,\
  \ people who eventually become friends, all the time i close my eyes and think the\
  \ way i feel when i have a broken heart, but then i fell my heart beatting so hard\
  \ that i fell that the things that dont kill you make you stronger."
