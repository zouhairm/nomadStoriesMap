Text: "It all started from that day I decided to do my internship in a foreign country,\
  \ I was looking for a company in Film Production in the UK. But after dozen and\
  \ dozen of emails, I couldn't find anything. One of my best friends told me to look\
  \ up in the South, so I started looking in Lisbon. The second day I have got a Skype\
  \ an interview and got the placement. I was super excited. \n\nThe day of departure\
  \ was getting closer and closer; knowing that I didn't know a word in Portuguese.\
  \ I thought I would make it with my English. The first weeks were the hardest, I\
  \ was feeling really lonely and disappointed. I just wanted to go home. But after\
  \ sometimes, I got used to another type of freedom, the freedom of a vagabond, I\
  \ felt a new energy. I was literally going out by myself, finding activities, exploring...\
  \ In search of the most beautiful landscapes and views: alone or with somebody,\
  \ it didn't really matter to me anymore. I was enjoying that trip more than I believed.\
  \ \n\nLearning that I could cross the limits I was simply setting myself with, I\
  \ met new people. And started the journey of my life; spending time with locals\
  \ and especially Brazilian; it taught me how to see the beauty of simple things.\
  \ We were going to dance bars, learning steps like bachata, forro, samba... \nWalking\
  \ in the streets singing and dancing, a whole new way of living open up to me. \n\
  \nAll the time spent on that train along the beaches, those festivals, those wonderful\
  \ people I met, got me vibing so much more with the environment. Looking back on\
  \ these two months living in that capital, I just reflect on myself and see a completely\
  \ different person. It got me to the point, I didn't want to go back home and enjoy\
  \ more and more. \n\nBeing able to learn from local people is such a treasure. And\
  \ understanding that loneliness isn't something bad. You can always find people\
  \ and activities to look for to go against the insanity of the first days. \nI wish\
  \ I started earlier in the trip to have that mindset but it came with the time and\
  \ with the people I've met. \n\nSince then I went back 3 times to Lisbon, as I love\
  \ this beautiful place in which there is so much to be discovering and looking for.\
  \ I also went back to see the amazing people that made me change my view on that\
  \ trip and taught more than anything else on how to live life with joy. 'Alegria'\
  \ \nI now can understand and speak Portuguese, as I've felt in love with the Brazilian\
  \ accent. \n\nFrom now, I spend my time looking for opportunities to discover my\
  \ city, Bordeaux, as I realized when we are so caught up in our own routine, and\
  \ our own country, we do not take the time to appreciate the beauty of our own environments.\
  \ I go to international meetings organized to encounter people from everywhere,\
  \ mixing our cultural backgrounds and we after meet up with a whole bunch of girls\
  \ to enjoy a good dinner, as a tourist in my own city.  \n\nTraveling in that city\
  \ got me to understand the nature of our habits, and how it is at first difficult\
  \ to adapt, but it gets you stronger, more aware of your surrounding, and by all\
  \ the good it gives you such a wonderful experience to share and use for the next\
  \ trips. \nI now live my life so differently, since I have gotten back from these\
  \ trips and I can't wait to go back, take pictures and filmmaking; discovering more\
  \ foods, activities, and landscapes. \n\nBecause the first days I was counting the\
  \ days to go back home, the last days I was holding on to the latest moments I would\
  \ share in that city. \n\nI am proud to share the story, it feels good to see how\
  \ much I have grown up since I couldn't do anything on my own. Scared of getting\
  \ out of my comfort zone. Sometimes is good to make yourself ease. It ceases you\
  \ from the fear. \n\nLOVE XOXO"
