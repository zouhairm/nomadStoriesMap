Text: "As we drive, I am acutely aware of my fingertips as they brush the crisp morning\
  \ air out my window. The sense of being in a new, foreign city envelops me and each\
  \ moment seems surreal. \u201CHow many times have I dreamt about this?\u201D plays\
  \ through my mind. \n\nI take it all in: lush tropical trees, colorfully dilapidated\
  \ homes butted up to high rises, lone cows in yards, trash on the street, and BMWs\
  \ next to battered and outdated models. Though exhausted from the 24-hour trip,\
  \ I feel alive. Even though I didn\u2019t know quite what to expect, this place\
  \ seems to be from another place and time\u2014a complex mix of rich and poor side\
  \ by side; of modern and archaic.  \n\nRed clay oozes over pavement street after\
  \ street, making me wonder where the roads end and the clay begins. I look into\
  \ the eyes of locals selling limes, flor de coco, and chipa from car to car during\
  \ the height of the day. Children press their faces to closed car windows, and some\
  \ even clean windshields within the time span it takes for traffic lights to change.\
  \ \n\nI learn the government doesn\u2019t help these people. I also learn that police\
  \ take bribes, and pull cars over at check points instead of from behind the wheel.\
  \ I learn to greet people with two kisses on the cheek. I also learn this is the\
  \ happiest country in the world. \n\nThis first day is both a wonder and a shock,\
  \ and as the days come and go I feel both out of place and a sense of familiarity.\
  \ While they speak a different tongue, a mixture of Spanish and Guaran\xED, I am\
  \ treated like family\u2014like someone they\u2019ve known all their lives. I am\
  \ mute, but try to speak and understand what little I can pronounce. \n\nI start\
  \ to become a part of this underrated location sandwiched between Brazil and Argentina.\
  \ Paraguay\u2014a country ripe with passion and pride for their home and people.\
  \ It\u2019s a place you don\u2019t see plastered across Instagram but is just as\
  \ noteworthy; a place where you can spend hours talking to a stranger on the street\u2014\
  where time seems irrelevant. But mostly, it\u2019s a place where you can arrive\
  \ a stranger and leave as family."
