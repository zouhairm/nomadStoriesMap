Text: Paris is simply romance, fantasy, and history. I chose this city of lights for
  my next academic conference on language and culture in late 2018. The conference
  promised a rich cross-cultural connection. Academics and cultural workers would
  come from all over and there would be talks about scholarly things while sipping
  a steaming Frech brew. I was convinced. I sent my abstract, got accepted, paid the
  dues, and flew to find this city as welcoming despite arriving there in the small
  wee hours of the morning when not a leaf moved. On the road from the airport, the
  nippy air met me. All over, with walls screaming, was the warmth of a dream of people
  wanting to get free, with the Fexit becoming a mantra and with the yellow vest revolutionaries
  soldiering to make that dream come true. In that Parisian fall, the nights were
  long. The days hid as fast as they could in sealed windows and temperature-controlled
  rooms. The egalite, fraternite, and liberte etchings on the facade of old buildings
  spelled out the desires of people wanting to partake of the good life. The Paris'
  working class demanded a place in the banquet table. In the cold of fall, they began
  to fight for something better while I commandeered the daylight hours to get to
  see the smiling Mona Lisa. And then the conference was over, and then the time to
  leave behind Paris. I left that city with a promise to go see it one  more time
  in the summer when the days are longer and the nights promptly hide in sun-bathed
  skies.
