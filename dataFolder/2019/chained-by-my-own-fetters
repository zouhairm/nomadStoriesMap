Text: "Auroville in India was the final destination of my learning journey in south\
  \ India. I had never travelled out of East Africa. The moment I stepped my foot\
  \ on Mumbai everything became strange, I felt like a celebrity of the sorts, it\
  \ was new to me that someone could be excited over how I looked, while others asked\
  \ for a selfie, others stole it. They asked one question in English \u201Cwhich\
  \ country\u201D? With a smile I kept replying \u2018Uganda\u2019. Everyone seemed\
  \ to be happy with me but had a difficulty to communicate it and instead repeated\
  \ the question, \u2018which country\u201D?\nWhen I was leaving Kampala my biggest\
  \ worry was the nights I was going to go to bed hungry because of the hot spices,\
  \ today if I chose to go back to India, it would be to eat Malai Kofta or Biryani.\
  \                                                                              \
  \                                                       I did not know that India\
  \ was going to reject me, I did not know that even their ATM machines would reject\
  \ my VISA card as a way to force me into a conversation with a strange person in\
  \ a strange language!                                                          \
  \                             \nWell the language barrier, plus lack of cash, and\
  \ the fear of spicy food worked to my advantage, all I needed was to smile my way\
  \ out of Mumbai in the shortest time possible.\n I caught a train from Mumbai to\
  \ Udaipur. In Udaipur I am welcomed by incense and temples on every side of the\
  \ street, it is also festival time, the city is decorated, but I am more worried\
  \ about the cash I badly need to move to Swaraj University in the out skirts of\
  \ this city before its dark. My fear has caught up with me, it is 9:00pm and I don\u2019\
  t have a way to access cash, I go to a petrol station, in less than a minute I am\
  \ surrounded, those who know a few words in English are asking me \u201Cwhich country\u201D\
  ? A few are taking pictures, but one realizes I look confused, he wants to help\
  \ but he can hardly speak English. He approaches a car that is being refilled and\
  \ comes with a lady, her first question is \u201Cwhich country\u201D, then she asks\
  \ me where am going and if I need any help. I explain that my VISA card has been\
  \ rejected and the only currency I have is Ugandan Shillings. She leads me to money\
  \ changers who laugh at my currency, she then tells me one of them is going to give\
  \ me 1000 Rupees which can help me get accommodation for that night and also pay\
  \ local cabs to Swaraj University. The money exchanger takes me to a guest house.\
  \ This is the most scaring part of my journey, a wooden door that cannot lock very\
  \ well and it is my first time in this City. Strange enough it is morning and I\
  \ am actually safe! I was in Swaraj for five days, I continued to Ahmedabad, to\
  \ Bangalore and finally Auroville. \nIn Auroville, I was looking forward to shake\
  \ away the tension of the first nine days in India, I started my journey from Bangalore\
  \ to Auroville at 6:00pm. I knew I would be in Auroville latest 1:00Am. When we\
  \ had gone three quotas of the journey the driver stopped and started repairing\
  \ the cab. He did this for more than two hours. He then came back, pulled his seat\
  \ and rested till morning. I later was told he did not want to enter Auroville in\
  \ the middle of the night because it is prohibited. Right from the entrance of the\
  \ gate to Auroville to the rituals that happened in the Matrimandir, my spirit seemed\
  \ to be in prison, and there was a struggle for me to break this prison open. At\
  \ the guest house as I checked in I was told how to live in Auroville,I kept both\
  \ my camera and phone in the guest house for the three days in fear of offending\
  \ the people there.\nAfter my learning Journey, my bank in Kampala had found solutions\
  \ to my VISA card, I bought the most beautiful fabric in India for my wedding which\
  \ is in one month and Left for Uganda."
