Text: "It was around 11:15am on November 21, 2018. I found myself in the middle of\
  \ busy Muslim community of Delhi, also known as the heart of India. \n\nThe cab\
  \ driver left me in front of MAX hospital at malviya nagar of Delhi from the Delhi\
  \ airport after I asked him to take a place where I could find an apartment to stay.\
  \ I prefer the apartment rather than the hotel because I actually wanted to enjoy\
  \ the local culture very closely.\n\nI thought it would be difficult to find a home\
  \ stay only for one or two days in a place I never visited earlier. But I surprised\
  \ when Mr Ahmed, owner of a five story building, opposite to Max hospital, just\
  \ allow me to stay one of the 1800 sft three bed room flat only for Rs 2200, after\
  \ learning about my interest. \n\nAhmed also offered a gas stove and some crockery,\
  \ so that I can cook if I want. But I was hungry to explore the local food and atmosphere\
  \ rather than cooking. \n\nI never realized that surprise was also awaiting for\
  \ me there. I was looking for- \nBiriyani, one of the most popular food in Delhi.\
  \ It really left me thinking when the hotelier asked my that how much I wanted to\
  \ buy, one or two kg biriyani... after I told him to give one person food.\n\nLater,\
  \ the hotelier gave one kg biriyani, made with spicy chicken and rice, which was\
  \ enough for one person lunch. \n\nNow it was time to explore the city. When I was\
  \ about to take a taxi, my landlord asked me to travel by metro rail or by baby\
  \ taxi, which was cheap and help me to learn more. I follow his instructions and\
  \ i started my journey by starting visit to Jantar Mantar. \n\nThe site is one of\
  \ five built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur, from 1723 onwards, as he was given\
  \ by Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah the task of revising the calendar and astronomical\
  \ tables.\n\nI passed a busy schedule in following 48- hour. I have visited Red\
  \ Fort, Lotus Temple, national railway museum, Jama Masjid, Qutub Minar, Birla Temple,\
  \ Old fort, national zoo, India gate and chandi chawk market. \n\nI have my most\
  \ memorable moments of my life in Qutub Minar. One will found dozens of Squirrel\
  \ in the tree, inside the monument.\n\nThey eat peanut that left by the tourist\
  \ in the monument street. The surprising thing happens when a Squirrel jump on my\
  \ hand after I raise the hand to provide them peanut. The Squirrel did not want\
  \ to leave me and look into my eyes. When I provide a big peanut, it goes away with\
  \ it and come back within moments with another Squirrel empty hand. \n\nThey later\
  \ stayed with me for around half an hour. They even did not go away when I take\
  \ the photograph with them. This was really was an exceptional moment in Delhi.\n\
  \nOne thing, I did not met with any fraud during my Delhi visit and people were\
  \ very friendly. They hug me, offered me food, traditions. \n\nEven I found people\
  \ in the local kitchen market are also friendly. \n\nIf I got chance, I would visit\
  \ Delhi again and again."
