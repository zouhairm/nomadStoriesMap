Text: "No matter how much you plan, life can detour you in another direction... and\
  \ sometimes that means a couple of thousand miles. 1 month into our Epic North American\
  \ roadtrip and looking forward to the PNW. We drive across the Golden Gate Bridge,\
  \ radio turned up, singing so loud our voices might as well be echoing across the\
  \ bay. This was basically the summary of the trip so far, a little too much smooth\
  \ sailing... 3 hours north of San Francisco we prepare to stop for the night, with\
  \ our singing voices dimming with the sunlight we soon realize that other sounds\
  \ replace ours. The run down car always had a slight hum to it, but tonight that\
  \ hum was more out of tune. For girls with plenty of time to spare (4 weeks of travelling\
  \ left to be exact), patience was not on our side. \n\n\"So ladies... what will\
  \ it be? The good or the bad news first?\" the mechanic said as he pursed his lips.\n\
  \nWe both look at each other with the same expression, dread. \n\n\"We have the\
  \ replacement parts in stock, it's the engine. Your car won't make it another 100\
  \ miles like this.\"\n \nSophia and I walk out of the mechanics and burst into tears.\
  \ How could this happen when we had planned every moment of this trip day by day.\
  \ I looked at her with slight hope and said \"I've got an idea, but you will have\
  \ to trust me in this.\" \n\nThere was a lot of pressure on me to continue a perfect\
  \ holiday for us both. We jumped in the car, drowned out the faulty mechanical with\
  \ noises this time with nervous singing and attempted to drive all the way back\
  \ to San Francisco, against the advice of the mechanic. \n\nThe failing engine roared\
  \ louder and louder yet somehow we still made it to the city limits. I pulled up\
  \ the GPS on my barely visible cracked iphone screen and we parked at the local\
  \ church. \"There's some charity bins there, donate all your clothes you can't fit\
  \ in your carry bag\" I said.\n\nShe looked at me in horror. Almost refusing to\
  \ follow my orders, I attempted to turn the car back... and there it happened. \"\
  It's gone, the engine has given up\" I grinned.\n\n\"What are you up to... why are\
  \ you smiling?\" she said. \n\n\"Trust me.\"\n\nAs she throws away most of what\
  \ she owns I call up the towing company and requested to be towed to a mechanic...\
  \ near the airport.\n\nArriving almost empty handed, I give away one of my last\
  \ items, the car keys. \"Feel free to use the other parts of this car, we have no\
  \ use for it anymore.\" I spit out.\n\nSophia and I walk out with a small bag each\
  \ and around the corner to the airport.  She finally started piecing together what\
  \ might occur next.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" she said.\n\n\"Mexico, our flight\
  \ leaves in 2 hours\" I reply.\n\nWe embarked the plane with very little, yet we\
  \ have no idea the amount of we would come back, an overflowing sense of adventure\
  \ and wanderlust. \n\nIt has been a few years now however that trip was still the\
  \ best decision I have ever made.\n\nThank god my car died."
