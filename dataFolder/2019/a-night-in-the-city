Text: "It was a night in the city, far away from the countryside, that was were I\
  \ have born and always remain there, it was a trip planned by my brother to all\
  \ of us, me and my family, we were surprised, I was fascinated, because it was my\
  \ first trip to Dubai for luxury not for renew our passport, we Were going to sleep\
  \ in Dubai, outside of alain, I was going to see the sea for the first time in my\
  \ life, my heart was racing, I couldn\u2019t sleep the whole way, unlike my sisters,\
  \ they slept after the first ten minutes, when we arrived, my brother suggested\
  \ that we put the bags without unpacking anything, to go to the beach to have a\
  \ glimpse of the beauitful dark blue sea, because we reach there in the evening,\
  \ so the sky blue turned to dark blue, I was amazed,happy, I have finally seen the\
  \ sea that I always saw in the T.V. , we went one at a time with my big sister,\
  \ who knew how to swim, to hold our hand for us to not sink in the sea, I was the\
  \ last one to put her legs in the water, it was cold, I felt like the sea is pulling\
  \ me down, I was afraid, but I challenged my self to stay longer, the water reached\
  \ my knees, my dress was soaked wet, but I wanted to go even deeper, my brother\
  \ stopped me, and tolled us that it was late, so we should go back, we were sad,\
  \ but our brother promised us to get back in the new year firework, we smiled instantly,\
  \ we went back to our apartment , passing by the road of restaurants, we were ashamed\
  \ of our soaked cloth, and applied that to our brother, but he said: you should\
  \ be you, whatever you look like in the moment, we had a great experience together,\
  \ and we are happy, so why should we care about what other may think of us, we didn\u2019\
  t do anything wrong, we agreed a bit.\nWe reached the apartment that was ours for\
  \ only a day and a night, but nothing was spectacular like seeing the sea for the\
  \ first time, I had a great time with my family, a night date with the sea, it was\
  \ travel to me, even if it wasn\u2019t to some, and that was my travel story."
