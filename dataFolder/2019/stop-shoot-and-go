  >\n>            Love is travel, a tour that's unforgettable, a journey with lots\
  \ of ups and downs, a living example of the life we are on, so let's pack our bags\
  \ we are going on a small trip.\n>             Everybody here is a traveler, travelling\
  \ for happiness, looking forward for adventures, new exploration new friends, and\
  \ a never ending journey full of happiness. Travel can be put down as shot movie\
  \ that has everything in it from that rising sun shining on you giving you a light\
  \ to travel ahead and a relaxing evening to the silence of the dark night with a\
  \ glorious, gloomy, glowing Moon. And all between that day is the life we enjoy,\
  \ party that is been celebrated, a dream that is coming true, a photo shoot that's\
  \ going on very well, a camp fire which was there the whole night with a warmth\
  \ and a cozy climate that kept you going on.\n>           Each travel trip you go\
  \ is going to be a story that you'll be excited about to share with your loving\
  \ ones. And more over you be a storyteller and share out your emotions and the adventures\
  \ of travelling.\n>           And for some travelling might not be as same as you,\
  \ so giving time to yourself and coming out of your comforts and daily routines\
  \ and experiencing the journey would be a relaxing and a leisure time and likely\
  \ to be in heaven, giving a peace of mind to come out strong.\n> After all this\
  \ having experienced and adventured and going away from daily life and the daily\
  \ routines, the tour that is comes to an end. But let's rewind what is does it has\
  \ to say about #TRAVEL in short and in my ways its a journey and life that you never\
  \ knew and taking you close to yourself and getting to know more about yourself.\
  \ And somewhere close to your heart. Thanks for travelling with me in this short\
  \ journey of my visionary tour. Thank you."
