Text: "\u201CIt looks like I am now the African and you the European\u201D he says,\
  \ arms folded over a dishevelled white t-shirt, shoulders perched against a Karite\
  \ (shea) tree. The tree whose butter he applies to soothe his calloused palms. Fabrice\
  \ steps in as translator for a group of bewildered ladies who blurt words out at\
  \ me in Djoula, a Burkinabe language.  They are confused. I look like them, I am\
  \ built like the men they know, but I do not speak their language. \u201CAnglais\u201D\
  , The French man gestures, before continuing with them in Djoula. \nI was born in\
  \ a country 500km from where we stood. Twenty-seven years later, I find myself agitated\
  \ and embarrassed amidst my kin in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. \nTo explain how\
  \ this moment came to be, let me first take you 11,000km across the Indian Ocean\
  \ to Varanasi, India. There I am, atop a rusty boneshaker of a rickshaw. I am being\
  \ paraded at walking pace through one of the oldest inhabited cities of the world.\
  \ Rickshaws, cows, what passes for cars, trucks and a million motorcycles joust\
  \ for the same piece of what was once tarmac. An entire family straddle a single\
  \ bike dressed with the colours of the rainbow. Horns aplenty pierce eardrums along\
  \ with the rumble of 2-stroke motors that whine like angry bees. The moist air is\
  \ heavy with the mid-day sun and a heat haze casts peculiar shadows on the road.\
  \ Exhaust fumes fill the air, embroiled with the scent of deep frying, cardamom\
  \ and the odour of cremation; carried through the air by floating ashes from funeral\
  \ pyres. \nSouth African! African, black man! Bob Marley! These words fly through\
  \ the air at me. Heads turn with disbelief and scrutinising faces gather to point\
  \ bewildered fingers at the sight of an African in Varanasi. A million moustached\
  \ faces gather as we stop in traffic. Saying nothing to me, they point, they laugh\
  \ and they chatter amongst themselves. Kali! One shouts, referring to the Hindu\
  \ Goddess of destruction whose form is depicted in purest black. \nIn that moment,\
  \ driven by a wrenching discomfort, I decide to head across to the African continent\
  \ where everyone looks like me.\nThus I found myself at the borders of the Sahara,\
  \ Bobo Dioulasso, in search of comfort and the sounds of Africa underneath a karite\
  \ tree. In this ancient town 360km west of Ouagadougou, where the roads are made\
  \ yellow by sands from the Sahara, live the poorest of the poor of Africa. It was\
  \ here, where the folk are blessed with melanin that I found Fabrice the French\
  \ man.\nThere\u2019s not much in Bobo; an ancient mosque and a train station is\
  \ about it. But you don\u2019t go to Bobo Dioulasso for historic architecture. You\
  \ go for the music.  Here live the ancestors of the Griot, musicians who played\
  \ for the Nubian royalty of Lost Africa. Here dwell clan whose names are Kieta and\
  \ Diabate. These are names of dynasties where once death befell those who dared\
  \ to lay but a finger upon their consecrated instruments.\nAmong these names sits\
  \ Fabrice, from morning until dusk each Sunday. They play ancestral music for the\
  \ tribes of Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana and Senegal. He sits front centre, right leg\
  \ stretched across his balafon. To his left sits Moussa Diabate, a blind maestro,\
  \ poised against his balafon. Behind them the boys from Baragnouma; master artisans\
  \ of West African music. They play, they drink, they chat and they laugh. Dancers\
  \ ebb and flow throughout the day, but the band remains, until the sun has marched\
  \ below the horizon. \nFabrice moved from France to Bobo Dioulasso over 20 years\
  \ ago, learnt the language and married his Burkinabe sweetheart. Bobo is his life\
  \ now. He walks among locals not as a stranger but as their kin. His tribe is \u2018\
  Baragnouma\u2019; a Burkinabe community who sculpt djembes, balafons and koras from\
  \ the sacred wood and hides of West Africa. \nWhite folk in this region are greeted\
  \ with \u2018Toubabou\u2019, an affectionate expression for white Europeans. Not\
  \ Fabrice. He is greeted with blessings and benedictions reserved for natives of\
  \ Bobo Dioulasso. They say \u201CAllah-qa Baraka\u201D meaning God bless you, and\
  \ he responds \u201CAmeena\u201D, Amen."
