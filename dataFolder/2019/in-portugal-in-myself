Text: "Sometimes the way in which the life of a person can change is very interesting,\
  \ even more when ever you think you are going to change. When I was 22 years old,\
  \ was in a terrible situation, that year fell ill with a disease known as hypothyroidism,\
  \ the economy was in the worst conditions, my qualifications at the university were\
  \ no longer the excellent notes that obtained regularly and i walked into a depressive\
  \ state serious. In one of my searches for help in the internet, curiously I found\
  \ a web page which had never heard and was not related with any of my problems;\
  \ but that is always in my memory: had entered the world of ERASMUS programs. ERASMUS\
  \ MUNDUS is a large organization throughout the world and is characterized by granting\
  \ scholarships and assistance to researchers who want to develop in other countries.\
  \ \n\nAfter a long and hard preparation I managed to be a part of the program and\
  \ fulfill the sleep that he had always wanted to fulfill. There was granted to me\
  \ the honor of studying 6 months in the Faculdade of Medicine of the Universidade\
  \ do Porto, I was feeling so happily in the moment that I it knew that I looked\
  \ at the sky and in my solitude I cried of happiness. \n\nWhen you get into this\
  \ type of things usually nobody tells you the reality of things and the worst thing\
  \ in my case was that in my native country Bol\xEDvia the exit of our borders is\
  \ an act so restricted that only those persons of elite and linked to the policy\
  \ can do so. That is why when I arrived at the airport accompanied by all my family,\
  \ I said goodbye to sad, tired, with fear, anguished, but somehow it was happy to\
  \ learn about what it was a plane, An airport waiting room, beautiful and handsome\
  \ aircraft employees, all gentle and friendly. \n\nWhen we arrived at our destination\
  \ did not know what to do, I went into shock to witness a great infrastructure of\
  \ airport, people from all parts of the world with an education admirable (something\
  \ rare to see in my country), but especially because in a moment I saw the return\
  \ ticket and I could not believe still that it was not going to be back with my\
  \ beloved family in a long time, 2 years to be exact. \n\nFortunately I traveled\
  \ when the technology and the social networks already existed, by what the contact\
  \ was facilitated to me with my dears and also the communication with the local\
  \ people because my Portuguese in those times was very bad so I used Google or some\
  \ app to be able to translate words. \n\nAt first I suffered enough, since talvez\
  \ because most of things did not exist in my people, almost everything was turning\
  \ out to be a stranger for me: the language, the transport (in that one then it\
  \ did not know the service of the meter), the housing, the university, the education\
  \ of the teachers, the schoolmates, really I was surprising of everything even of\
  \ vending machines candy, which is very sad i know). \n\nI realized that it was\
  \ entering again the very strong depressive state, but then I started thinking and\
  \ said to myself: If I give up now... what will happen with everything what I obtained\
  \ till now?... I'll disappoint the people who trusted me?.. Is this my limit?. So,\
  \ in the same moment I answered myself and said NOT. \n\nI woke up the next day\
  \ and began to study in a way that I had never done, I spent whole nights without\
  \ sleep, I started to exercise and eat well and in a short time my Portuguese improved\
  \ notably, I adapted to the rhythm of the university, I made many friends (who are\
  \ now like Brothers for  me), I overcame myself as a person and realized that if\
  \ someone wants to fulfill their dreams, first must fight and overcome their own\
  \ obstacles, I can give credibility to that."
