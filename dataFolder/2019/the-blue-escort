Text: "I am intrigued by water bodies; namely, waterfalls. I would climb any mountain,\
  \ cross any river, trek through any forest, if I know there would be a waterfall\
  \ waiting on the other side. \n\nOn one such mission, I am trekking through a dense\
  \ forest in South India. The heavy rains of monsoon have left the soil murky and\
  \ sticky. Moving forward isn't easy, but I'm determined. \n\nThese woods are popular\
  \ for the vast population of wild elephants that invade it. As excited as I would\
  \ be to cross paths with one, I silently pray that I don't, since I obviously don\u2019\
  t have the slightest idea how to face it. \n\nThere is a strong smell of wet soil\
  \ in the air. The eerie silence is filled with all different kinds of sounds; the\
  \ rustling of the leaves in the breeze, the distant cry of peacocks, and quiet and\
  \ consistent sounds of many creatures that I would probably never know. When the\
  \ loud rhythmic cry of the cicada didn't invade my ears, I hear my clumsy, unsteady\
  \ footsteps digging deep into the mushy soil and then being lifted up again. It's\
  \ been more than an hour since I started walking in the direction where I believe\
  \ the waterfall would be, but I still haven't heard the familiar, uplifting roar\
  \ of the water. The loud silence of the air, even with all the sounds, is disturbing\
  \ and moreover, discouraging.\n\nAs I keep walking, the forest becomes denser. Branches\
  \ of taller, thicker trees hover above me, blocking the sunlight hitting the ground.\
  \ It is a bright afternoon but it didn't feel that way anymore. From this part of\
  \ the jungle, the world is black, with just enough streaks of light to stop me from\
  \ crashing into barks of trees. It could very well be my imagination, but deeper\
  \ in, I hear a series of new sounds, and this bothers me. I hear low growls in the\
  \ distance and howls that can only belong to a pack of wolves. I feel the ground\
  \ trembling slightly as if something large and heavy is moving closer to me. I picture\
  \ an elephant, and for the first time today, I panic. I can't see a clearing anywhere\
  \ around me, no sign that there would be a water body within at least two miles'\
  \ radius. There's nearly five hours left for sunset. I start to question my choice\
  \ of coming here on my own. Not the wisest decision, I would say. I stop and look\
  \ around, taking everything in. The air smells of herbs and soil, and probably,\
  \ of existence. The sky looks grey and gloomy from what is visible beyond the hovering\
  \ trees. \n\nExhausted, I flop down on the ground. It must be my loneliness or the\
  \ pure terror in the atmosphere of the forest, but I feel the lack of motivation\
  \ to move forward. Then I see it. Royal blue feathers stand out grandly against\
  \ its little black head. It\u2019s the bird of paradise. Spreading its wings, it\
  \ flies to another tree. Oblivious of the aim of my jaunt and exhaustion I feel,\
  \ I stand up and follow the bird. Immersed in his soothing perfection, I lose track\
  \ of time, hardly noticing where I\u2019m going. \n\nI don\u2019t know for how long\
  \ I have been trailing behind the bird, when my ears perk up in response to a familiar\
  \ sound in the distance. Not a bird or animal or insect. Soft at first, it becomes\
  \ louder with every step I take. The roar of water crashing on rocks, the sound\
  \ I\u2019ve been listening out for since the past 4 hours. The elegant blue creature\
  \ settles on a tree, filled with thousands of the species, cooing in chorus. The\
  \ tree looked like a blue gem, and it felt like it was mine. It felt like Christmas,\
  \ Easter and Thanksgiving had all just rolled into one. I feel a shiver of satisfaction\
  \ as I near the gigantic falls. Kneeling down, I lower my hands into the ice cold\
  \ water, and drink it. The familiar feeling of accomplishment washes over me as\
  \ the iciness of the water fills my exhausted body."
