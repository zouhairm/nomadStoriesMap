Text: "She told me I was brave. Probably the bravest one between all of us. I didn't\
  \ agree with her, \"but thanks\" I said. The truth is: Barcelona wouldn't be the\
  \ same without them.\n\nIt was my first-time outside Brazil and I wasn\u2019t expecting\
  \ that much from Barcelona. Maybe Madrid caught me on first glance, but this is\
  \ mainly because I didn\u2019t have plans. For a first-time traveler, that was kind\
  \ of scary. When I arrived there, with all my what-the-hell-am-I-doing-here feelings,\
  \ I just felt dislocated. People selling souvenirs. Travelers with their bags rolling\
  \ on the sidewalks. The mixed sound of Spanish and French that is Catalan. Some\
  \ guys skating. The freezing wind. All I wanted was to lay down for a couple of\
  \ hours, cut off from the world. At that time, I couldn\u2019t imagine that it wouldn\u2019\
  t happen as soon as I wanted.\n\nThen I was inside my hostel. Cool place, cool people,\
  \ I thought. My mind was telling me to go to bed, to have some sleep, but then the\
  \ Argentinian receptionist said: \u201Cwe\u2019ll have free dinner tonight and then\
  \ we\u2019re having a salsa class\u201D. My stomach took the lead and so I accepted\
  \ his offer without hesitation.\n\nA few minutes later after taking a shower and\
  \ settling into this hostel, I found myself sitting around this table with almost\
  \ ten people from different countries, eating ramen made by a Venezuelan guy. All\
  \ the questions that I had, rising from my gut feeling of Barcelona as an apathetic\
  \ city, were somehow gone. The problem wasn\u2019t the city, it was me.\n\nI decided\
  \ to go to another country because I wanted to escape from my comfort zone. The\
  \ work-home-work-home cycle was simply making me sad. I knew that I needed more\
  \ than what my routine was offering me. That\u2019s why I crossed the Atlantic Ocean,\
  \ hoping to live and to learn from different experiences.\n\nIf I was looking for\
  \ something new to tell when I was back home, I shouldn\u2019t stop myself at that\
  \ dinner table. I had to go further. So, I went to the salsa class. For me, the\
  \ night brought life into the city of Barcelona. The lights, the youngers walking\
  \ on the street, the noise from cars and people yelling and the coziness of the\
  \ cold night. Being part of a group ready to do something new made me feel alive.\
  \ I was in the middle of a dozen strangers and somehow I trusted them. \nSeeing\
  \ the blue lights and the moving bodies at Grac\xEDa Latina club, I just knew that\
  \ I was in the right place at the right moment. With the right people. The striking\
  \ unity dancing can bring. We were there learning how this Latin rhythm works, but\
  \ for me, it was more than music.\n\nThat night we ended up at the beach after dancing\
  \ the night away and I can't remember exactly what we were talking about. All I\
  \ know is that I was looking at Kiel (Philippines), Peter (UK), Kong (USA) and as\
  \ a new traveler, I learned that the world was bigger than my comfortable bubble.\n\
  \nWell, of course, I've always known that we live in a big world, but during those\
  \ days I couldn't even begin to imagine the dimensions, the people, the things that\
  \ I could learn. I was living. I had the experience to walk in Las Ramblas and go\
  \ to the public market La Boquer\xEDa, full of colors and distinct smells surrounded\
  \ by people that could show me another side of everything. I saw the feast dedicated\
  \ to Santa Eulalia, the strange yet beautiful expressions of gothic monuments and\
  \ the sunset at the beach, even if we couldn't feel the warmth of the sun.\n\nI\
  \ thought that I would discover Barcelona alone and the thought made me sad. Paradoxically,\
  \ I had the chance to meet incredible people and saw a different side of the city.\
  \ I remember my last day and how we were walking the streets at 5 a.m. Kiel told\
  \ me I was brave. I didn't agree. I feel that they opened my eyes to the courage\
  \ in me. We said goodbye to each other. That night, Barcelona was beautiful."
