Text: "I recently went to Paris, and, although it wasn\u2019t my first time there,\
  \ I believe it was the first time I got the chance to really grab upon -at least\
  \ a little bit- of the essence of the city. The first trip I made there was with\
  \ my mom, on a tour. We only went to the most popular places, on a bus, with other\
  \ tourists. It was like a theatre play, the city being the scenario. But this time\
  \ I had the fortune of being hosted by a friend, and that made the trip a whole\
  \ different experience.  One afternoon I went with my friend to Notre Dame, and\
  \ there I confessed to a priest. I hadn\u2019t confessed in years, so I told him\
  \ all my sins. And I felt this magic coming around me that hasn\u2019t left me,\
  \ and I don\u2019t think it ever will. To walk Paris is the best way to feel it.\
  \ Walk its streets, contemplating its urban art, and feeling the atmosphere, walking\
  \ through the Seine, singing to the river and noticing how sacred it is, how powerful.\
  \ The magic of its water is evolving all around the city. I believe Paris is a portal\
  \ to other worlds and dimensions. Its architecture is built with something more\
  \ than stones, it has souls in it. I believe every building in Paris is alive. I\
  \ could name them, and I think If you get quiet enough, you can hear the buildings\
  \ telling you their stories. What I didn\u2019t expect to find in Paris, was myself.\
  \ But that\u2019s exactly what I did. Walking its beautiful streets, looking at\
  \ the most talented street performers. I was collecting pieces of my soul that I\
  \ didn\u2019t even know were detached from me, I now know I went there to reconcile\
  \ with the hidden part of me, the sacred one. I can understand know why they call\
  \ it the city of light, because light is information and in my particular case,\
  \ Paris gave me the light I needed to see myself, and brought me back to my essential\
  \ being. And I will always be grateful for that."
