Text: "Desperate for a respite from a cruel, unrelenting PhD, I accepted an invitation\
  \ to a friend\u2019s wedding in India.  Having been raised in a modern Ireland which\
  \ still retains a lot of Catholic customs, most of my exposure to Indian traditions\
  \ came from what my friend had explained and TV \u2013 neither of which, I felt,\
  \ had properly prepared me for the actual experience.\nThe wedding should have lasted\
  \ seven days, however, because my friend had only a short break from her own PhD,\
  \ this was compressed into one day.  This made the whole adventure even more extraordinary\
  \ as it was so fast paced.  I sat through many ceremonies, feasts and selfies while\
  \ not quite believing that all of it was happening but I learned many things.\n\
  The first thing I learned is that (with a couple of exceptions) if a Hindu ceremony\
  \ does not contain turmeric, rice or a make-shift fire in containers and locations\
  \ that would not pass EU standards, then it is probably not a ceremony.\nThe second\
  \ thing I learned is that, while following the groom from his hotel to the wedding\
  \ ceremony on a horse laden with elaborate embellishments and a party of 50 people\
  \ (which was considered small), it was ok to completely stop traffic for the whole\
  \ group to dance in the middle of the road.\nThe third thing I learned is that if\
  \ you see a bull that looks crazy don\u2019t take a chance, just avoid it!  Unlike\
  \ any of the other 38 countries I\u2019ve visited, India has stray cows. Indeed\
  \ on the day we walked to the wedding ceremony in our tightly wrapped saris and\
  \ beautiful but non-athletic footwear there happened to be a stray bull that had\
  \ gone crazy. He didn\u2019t notice us approach but as the party was almost passed\
  \ he looked up... And charged. I, in my Indian finery, froze before coming to my\
  \ senses and shuffling away while a farmer used his tractor to distract the bull.\
  \  Thankfully nobody was hurt. \nThe fourth thing I learned was that Indian weddings,\
  \ similar to Irish weddings, love a bit of banter!  Upon our arrival at the wedding\
  \ venue there was a staged, good-humoured negotiation between the groom and the\
  \ bride\u2019s family who had set up a white ribbon across the entrance. It was\
  \ in Hindi, and therefore I didn\u2019t understand it, but a guest translated for\
  \ me. The groom\u2019s delegation tried to pass but the bride\u2019s delegation\
  \ forbid it and after many sweet words on the groom\u2019s part (and the handover\
  \ of a lot of gold, money and other valuables), the groom was given a scissors to\
  \ cut the ribbon and enter the reception.\nThen the party started. As one of five\
  \ Caucasians in a sea of hundreds of Indians there were a lot of selfies and holding\
  \ babies while posing. I dare say I and the other Europeans with me were photographed\
  \ almost as much as the bride and groom. \nThe party itself consisted of so many\
  \ elements I barely know how to order them without conveying the chaos that was\
  \ the wedding! The bride and groom were presented on a stage that was made like\
  \ a life-size horse drawn carriage and offered each other wreaths that looked like\
  \ they weighed more than small children. The bride\u2019s wedding dress was so heavily\
  \ embellished in a way that would make a jeweller envious. The dancing was spectacular\
  \ \u2013 Indian people are exceptional dancers and many Broadway musicals could\
  \ glean inspiration from their moves. The ceremony, of course, contained turmeric,\
  \ rice and a haphazard fire placed in a precarious position. Potentially the highest\
  \ of all highlights was the food \u2013 so delectable it made returning home very\
  \ difficult.\nIndia is a country very much unlike Western countries (I know this\
  \ is obvious) and there is a lot to experience. There is no wedding that I have\
  \ been to that even remotely compares to the chaos, the energy or the entertainment\
  \ of the wedding I attended in India. I would recommend anyone with the opportunity\
  \ to go and I am hyper with the expectation of my next Indian wedding in December.\
  \ Simply a conventional custom within a parallel universe."
