Text: "My best friend Karina is French and Finnish. My old roommate Eugenio is Venezuelan\
  \ American. We all met in San Francisco at different times. She came to visit in\
  \ fall of 2017 for 2 weeks. With both their attraction to each other and my nudging,\
  \ they got together before she left back to Finland. They really hit it off and\
  \ kept writing each other, and in Nov, he planned to go visit her in Finland for\
  \ two weeks. He ended up staying out there and they both live together to this day.\
  \ Summer 2018, I went to visit them in Tampere, Finland, after not seeing each other\
  \ for nearly a year. We went to her family\u2019s beautiful cabin in the woods one\
  \ weekend, and stayed there with her mom, sister, her sister\u2019s husband and\
  \ 2 kids, and her twin brother. I experienced my first true finnish tradition by\
  \ going in the sauna and jumping into the lake afterwards in the nude at night.\
  \ Drank a big swig of Polish vodka before my first dive, and to my surprise it felt\
  \ great! I want to learn French, and Karina\u2019s mother so kindly offered for\
  \ me to stay i. her house in France any time for as long as I want, free if charge.\
  \ I\u2019l have to take her up o. that offer in the near future. During my stay,\
  \ I also did a side trip to Turku, to visit my friend Pieti. Pieti is my good friend\
  \ Topi\u2019s brother, and Topi is Karina\u2019s ex-bf. Now I met Pieti in 2015,\
  \ when he was still a she and her name was Pi\xF1e. Pieti came to visit SF twice\
  \ while in transition, and we go to bond in brief instances over the years. While\
  \ in Turku, Pieti introduced me to his friend Ainou, and she was fantastic. The\
  \ 3 of us went out that night to several different bars and clubs. The atmosphere\
  \ in the city was heavy, as there was a huge neo-nazi rally earlier that day. At\
  \ around 3am, me and Ainou got in line at a stand that sold fries \U0001F35F While\
  \ in line, there was a group of women in front of us that started laughing. It was\
  \ infectious, and although I don\u2019t speak Finnish, I started laughing as well.\
  \ They turned around smiling to make conversation, and Ainou did the favor of acting\
  \ as translator. A minute after we stopped talking with them, a man that was with\
  \ the group of women turned around and asked me where I was from. He was a tall\
  \ ginger, with a mohawk, tattoos, wearing a black leather vest, and a braided goatee.\
  \ The guy looked like a viking warrior pulled straight out of the history books.\
  \ I told him I was from California, and we ended up chatting for about 5-10 minutes,\
  \ discussing national parks in the U.S. Deep into the conversation, I notice Ainou\
  \ looks bothered. She subtley shows me her phone, and in her notes she has written\
  \ \u201CThis guy you\u2019re talking to is a white supremacist. He\u2019s a neo-nazi\u201D\
  . My eyes widened, as I had no idea. I ended the conversation with him as quickly\
  \ and non-chalantly as I could. After we got the fries, Ainou told me that behind\
  \ me were a bunch of angry nazi\u2019s and that she thought one recognized her from\
  \ the protest rally she had been in that morning. We left asap. I ended up spending\
  \ the night at Ainou\u2019s, we really hit it off too. She walked me to the train\
  \ station the next day, and we kissed goodbye. She had just started school in Helsinki,\
  \ and on my last day of the trip, I went to Helsinki and we met up at bar and had\
  \ a drink before she had to leave to run some errands. I explored the city on my\
  \ own, and went to the airport at night, began my Sky Trek back home early in the\
  \ morning. Definitely returning later on down the road. And that was my trip to\
  \ Finland in 2018 \U0001F1EB\U0001F1EE"
