Text: "As my mother and I walked along the Chao Phraya river, we could already see\
  \ the towering spires of Wat Arun in the distance. The end of our long walk to the\
  \ temple was finally in sight. Each step made us a little more confident about reaching\
  \ our destination in no time. \n\nThen, abruptly, the path by the river ended, forcing\
  \ us inwards. And we promptly got lost. \n\nWe found ourselves dragging our feet\
  \ through a maze of dark, empty little lanes lined with tiny, rickety-looking shops\
  \ on both sides, all closed. By this time, we had already walked a lot to compensate\
  \ for the large amounts of food we'd stuffed ourselves with at breakfast. It was\
  \ muggy and sweltering, as Bangkok usually is in summer, which didn't bother us\
  \ before because we knew we were heading in the right direction, but now the heat\
  \ was making me feel rather like one of the steamed dumplings we'd eaten in the\
  \ last few days, and with no people in sight or a GPS to guide us, we were miserable.\
  \ \n\nThen, just as I was on the verge of bursting into tears, we turned a corner\
  \ and saw a man walk to his scooter from a stall. He was carrying a plastic packet\
  \ containing ice and some neon-red liquid. Now, although I consider myself adventurous\
  \ when it comes to food, I wouldn't normally picture myself drinking strange fluorescent\
  \ beverages out of a plastic bag. However, I was slightly delusional from the heat\
  \ and dehydration, so the condensation around the bag made the bright sparkling\
  \ liquid inside it seem like the Best Thing Ever.\n\nWe didn't know any Thai, but\
  \ I wasn't going to let a little thing like that get in the way. Gesticulating wildly,\
  \ I tried to communicate to the adorable old couple running the stall\u2015the only\
  \ thing open on that street\u2015that I wanted their alien red soda. In response,\
  \ the man showed me two big vats of dark, mysterious liquids bubbling away. I don't\
  \ know if it was due to our red, sweaty faces or my inadvertent expression of dismay,\
  \ but the lady called out to me and reassuringly rattled around some ice cubes in\
  \ a large tray. \n'Ah, thank goodness for ice! Well, then, here goes nothing', I\
  \ thought, randomly pointing to one of the two boiling vats.\n\nThe man poured some\
  \ reddish liquid from the chosen vat into a tall cup. He then proceeded to measure,\
  \ add, and mix together a variety of condiments (of which I recognised only condensed\
  \ milk) with the utmost care. Finally, he topped it all up with half a cup of ice.\
  \ Of the numerous drinks I've had over the years, I doubt that a single one has\
  \ ever been made with as much love and tenderness. The resulting pale orange concoction\
  \ turned out to be, as I realised much later, Thai iced tea.\n\nGetting lost was\
  \ turning out pretty well for me after all. The lady pointed us in the direction\
  \ of the Temple of Dawn, and we were on our way again, but not before taking a picture\
  \ of the lovely (and ridiculously photogenic) duo.\n\nPeople often talk about how\
  \ it's the journey that matters, not the destination. I'm not sure I totally agree.\
  \ Wat Arun, like so many other travel destinations, is indubitably spectacular.\
  \ That being said, I can't think of its magnificent structures and intricate carvings\
  \ without dwelling a touch longer on the beautiful couple and their life-affirming\
  \ drink. Without losing our way, we never would have found these charming locals\
  \ and the best Thai iced tea I've ever had. Given a chance, I would happily get\
  \ lost there all over again."
