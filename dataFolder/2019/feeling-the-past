Text: "I once read a comment on Youtube -a Polish native wrote: \" New york is beautiful,\
  \ I want to visit it before I die.\"  But that's just it, New York City isn't beautiful-\
  \ it's dirty, and noisy- it's crowded, and the people are rude; it's freezing in\
  \ the winter, and hot as hades in the summer-and oh, there's garbage on every street\
  \ corner. \n\nAnd that's what makes it so beautiful.\nIt's alive- it has a pulse,\
  \ a heartbeat.\nEvery person hears something different- a rhythm that syncs to their\
  \ own.\n\nWhen I walk through an older city ( and yes, I know NYC is young by European\
  \ standards, but it's one of America's oldest cities), I can feel the history in\
  \ the stones, in the buildings, in the trees. It's as though the city is showing\
  \ me a glimpse of what once was. \n\nBut New york City isn't just about the past,\
  \ it's also about the future. \n\nThat's the beauty of New york City- whatever you\
  \ want- it's there.\n\nJust go looking, and you'll find it. \n\nI wasn't born in\
  \ NYC, but moved there when I was ten years old, and I have lived in other cities\
  \ in America, and even other countries as an adult- but to me, New York City will\
  \ always be home."
