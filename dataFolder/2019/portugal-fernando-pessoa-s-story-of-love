Text: "My story is about how and why Portugal inspired the poems and books of Fernando\
  \ Pessoa, one of the most beloved literary creators in the history of the world,\
  \ through the most picturesque and poetic places that he traveled in his beloved\
  \ Portugal. Their magical landscapes, colorful buildings, the medieval and classical\
  \ spirit of the castles and and his incredibles beaches touching the Mediterranean\
  \ sea. The perfect scenarios that gave life to the poems of him and their heter\xF3\
  nimos.\n\nDo you know? Fernando Pessoa is a Portuguese writer who concentrated his\
  \ intelligence in creating his heteronyms. Multiple literary personality who he\
  \ endowed of life, from their imagination.  \xC1lvaro de Campos, Ricardo Reis and\
  \ Alberto Caeiro are some of the most prominent \u2013each one borned in a different\
  \ year\u2013,puting in evidence the different social and thinking decades of the\
  \ oldest country in Europe.\n\nCaeiro, a peasant with out studies; De Campos, a\
  \ social sentimentalist, but at the same time lonely; and Reis, a monarchist and\
  \ latinist lover of nature. No doubt, three characters that represent a big part\
  \ of the Portuguese territory. And taking advantage of these qualities, I will mix\
  \ the memories that the Portuguese have about the writer, and I will fall in love\
  \ and the readers fall in love when cross the time discovering the old streets and\
  \ the landscapes in the portuguese peoples relates but also knowing the friendly\
  \ society that Portugal ir today. So European and Latin. Not in vain, his language\
  \ is official in one of the largest countries in South America, Brasil."
