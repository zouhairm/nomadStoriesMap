Text: "We talked about it until deep winter descended upon us. Our indecision spreading\
  \ itself thin, like the sheets of ice that were now indiscriminately claiming the\
  \ streets, lakes and rivers of Newfoundland. This idea of traveling to Fogo, a remote\
  \ outport community off the northeast coast of the island, a regular topic of conversation\
  \ between myself and my friend Darrell. But life is busy, and our enthusiasm was\
  \ kept at bay by the approaching winter chill. By mid-November it dawned on me that\
  \ my time living in the jagged edge of Atlantic Canada was winding down. \n\nI had\
  \ traveled to Newfoundland for the summer season and was so enthralled by its harsh\
  \ and rugged beauty that I stayed for the fall. But as the unforgiving month of\
  \ December approached it was time to pack up my life and move to warmer seas. I\
  \ was unresolved about not having visited Canada\u2019s hidden gem and I sat with\
  \ Darrell at a local pub lamenting this missed opportunity. Two pints in, we decided\
  \ it was our Canadian responsibility to suppress our inclination for being warm\
  \ and go forth into the subarctic unknown. \n\nThree days later, we prayed to the\
  \ Gods of good weather and left St.John\u2019s hoping to make it to Fogo by the\
  \ evening. The highway was a dazzling ribbon of ice. By mid-morning, clusters of\
  \ ominous grey clouds gathered ahead of us until the sky opened its mocking mouth\
  \ in a torrent of freezing rain and sleet. My grip on the steering wheel was vice\
  \ like. We were traveling through moose country and at any moment a moose could\
  \ saunter onto the highway. It was nightfall by the time we arrived at the ferry\
  \ dock and close to midnight by the time my frostbitten car drove triumphantly off\
  \ the ferry platform and onto the fabled Fogo Island. Finding our Airbnb was a mission\
  \ like no other, we had no cell service and snow drifts lapped mercilessly against\
  \ the car as we traveled the dark and eerie roads. \n\nWith a little aide from a\
  \ truck driver and some light from the reluctant moon, we found our house \u2013\
  \ a traditional salt box house on stilts, perched miraculously on a cliff edge.\
  \ Exhaustion washed over me and I let the sounds of the angry wind and even angrier\
  \ sea lull me to sleep. We woke up to a world that was starkly dramatic, a cavernous\
  \ ocean and a snow-capped landscape chiseled out of glacier-scraped rocks. The plan\
  \ was to gear up and hike but a blizzard had also decided to visit Fogo island that\
  \ weekend. We conceded that winter on Fogo is, perhaps, best enjoyed indoors. We\
  \ made our way to the acclaimed Fogo Island Inn. \n\nThis architectural triumph\
  \ cannot be overstated \u2013 a mix of traditional Newfoundland architecture with\
  \ a contemporary innovation - the Inn is a brilliant, shimmering monolith straddling\
  \ the sea and the sky. We were greeted with open arms. Newfoundlanders are people\
  \ of grit and grace, always welcoming with warmth and good humour. We spent much\
  \ of our weekend at the Inn, marveling at the gallery exhibit and the library brimming\
  \ with books showcasing Newfoundland\u2019s deep and rich literary tradition. We\
  \ sipped cocktails by the fireplace while watching 10 ft waves crash against the\
  \ shoreline. We eat traditional Newfoundland food like jiggs dinner and salt meat.\
  \ But mostly, we spent time in the good company of islanders who regaled us with\
  \ stories of caribou hunts and whale encounters, fisherman tales and rural folklore.\
  \ One man told us how he fell in love with a Newfoundland girl and moved to \u2018\
  The Rock\u2019 - an apt nickname for an island of craggy coastlines, oceanic barrens\
  \ and ancient geology. On The Rock people don\u2019t ask you where you\u2019re from,\
  \ they ask: \u201Cto where do you belong?\u201D This idea of community and belonging\
  \ so deeply woven into the fabric of Newfoundland life. Our visit to Fogo felt like\
  \ we\u2019d traveled to the end of the earth, only to arrive at a place that felt\
  \ like home."
