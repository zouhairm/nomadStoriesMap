Text: "Making connection with people will teach you the different ways of life which\
  \ should be live by everyone. My travel was in Tamilnadu where I found the connection\
  \ with people and their deeds. \n\nTamil Nadu is a southern state of India which\
  \ is supremely rich in culture and heritage. Known to be one of the oldest civilisations\
  \ in the world, the people of Tamil Nadu belong to the prestigious Dravidian Family.\
  \ Tamilians also, like other South Indians, take much pride in their rooted culture\
  \ and make great efforts to protect their 2000 years old history. The state has\
  \ been ruled by the Cholas, Pandyas and the Pallavas and has been flourishing since.\
  \ The art and architecture have been their creations which are used and maintained\
  \ even today. \n\nA great amount of relevance is given to a person's religion when\
  \ it comes to personal identity. Although four-fifths of the population of the state\
  \ are Hindus, rest of them are divided in Islam, Christianity, and Jainism. Their\
  \ rituals include deity worship and animisms like tree worship, animal worship and\
  \ stars and planets worship. Many Hindus are followers of different religious institutions\
  \ called 'Matha' which are the centres of Monastic studies. \n\nMen can be seen\
  \ wearing a Lungi with a shirt and Angavastra. Lungi is a rectangular cotton cloth\
  \ tied across the waist, and Angavastra is a cloth draped around the shoulders.\
  \ It can be worn over or without a shirt. Some people may also wear dhoti which\
  \ is a long form of Lungi, the bottom of which is mostly stuck at the waist. Men\
  \ also wear Vibhuti on their forehead.\n\nIf you imagine 'South Indian Food', first\
  \ things which pop in mind Idli, Dosa, Sambhar, Vada, Upma and what not. It's a\
  \ typical Madrasi Food for North Indians. Tamil Food is popular in both vegetarian\
  \ and non-vegetarian contexts. Otherwise, rice, lentils, grains and vegetables from\
  \ the main ingredients in Tamil Cuisine. Rice is a staple food here. Sambhar and\
  \ Coconut Chutney are served with almost everything and guess what, it makes a fine\
  \ blend with most of them. For non-vegetarians, fish, turtle, mutton and venison\
  \ are preferred. Some Tamilians follow the tradition of eating on Banana Leaf even\
  \ today.\n\nTamil Music has evolved over the years. The most important form of music\
  \ was the Carnatic music which considered only for the elite who could understand\
  \ the intricacy of music. For others, Telugu songs and a mix of traditional numbers\
  \ from a source of entertainment. \n\nBharatnatyam is the official dance form of\
  \ Tamil Nadu, recognized all over India and the world. It's a complicated dance\
  \ form with subtle moves of body parts and expressions. Some other folk dances like\
  \ Parai, Villuputtu Karakaatam, and Kuthu are also performed by local people including\
  \ tribal people. \n\nKolam (also known as Rangoli) is drawn at the doors of every\
  \ house in Tamil Nadu. It is drawn before the sunrise and is said to welcome Goddess\
  \ Laxmi. This has become hugely popular among North Indians too.\n\nTamilians have\
  \ perfected the art of spinning, weaving and chiseling over the years and their\
  \ brilliance is reflected in different art subjects like bronzes, sculptor works,\
  \ carvings, etc. Magnificent temples represent Tamil architecture with lofty 'gopurams'\
  \ and statues of goddesses engraved all over the edifice. Many well-known temples\
  \ such as Meenakshi Amman Temple and Breehadeeshwara Temple are located here which\
  \ displays a grand vista of ancient Hindu mythological diversity and Tamil heritage.\n\
  \nWith a golden history of some great rulers and dynasties having ruled the state,\
  \ it's not surprising to find such splendor in architecture, literature, and traditions.\
  \ People of Tamil Nadu have a great legacy to live up to. The culture and traditions\
  \ have been safeguarded by them over the years and are manifested till today in\
  \ full vibrancy.\n\nTravel to Tamilnadu was my best part of life which I will be\
  \ remembered always. The way I connected people here was unforgettable. During my\
  \ travel I have made many friends from here who shared their perception of other\
  \ culture. You will be learning a lot and this will be the perfect lesson of life.\
  \ Therefore I always tell \" Travel to feel the world and to connect with people\
  \ \". Thank you."
