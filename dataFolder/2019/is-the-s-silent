Text: "The artist in me was instinctively pulled into a dimly lit store with walls\
  \ after walls covered in paper stencils of Laotian art. \"Yensabai\" the store,\
  \ had four interconnected wooden doors flung completely open, inviting you in. \n\
  \nThe calm on the street was helping me observe things I would\u2019ve otherwise\
  \ missed on a chaotic day. Tourists were definitely doing the \u201Cmust-dos\u201D\
  \ on their lists, I could say that with confidence since I was one of them just\
  \ an hour ago. Frustrated with hundreds of tourists blocking the sunset views on\
  \ Mount Phousi, I decided to stroll the less crowded parts of Luang Prabang. Boy\
  \ was I glad! \n\nThe locals seemed to have already drifted into holiday mode; it\
  \ was the eve before New Year\u2019s, and they were seen sitting outside their homes\
  \ and in alleyways, with friends and family, singing Laotian songs to celebrate\
  \ the end of one year, beginning of another. \n\nI was so engrossed in the beautiful\
  \ indigenous art all around me, taking in the intricate details \u2013 that I almost\
  \ didn\u2019t notice Anousith observing me with a big smile on his face. \u201C\
  Would you like to have some tea?\u201D I hadn\u2019t realized it was also a caf\xE9\
  . There was a small seating for four and the place was filled with a million other\
  \ tiny knick knacks. \n\nAnousith explained that they were about to shut but he\u2019\
  d be happy to host me as his last customer for the day. I politely refused since\
  \ I didn\u2019t want to be distracted by conversation. I went back to selecting\
  \ a stencil I loved, noticing the uneven hand strokes, that made it so much more\
  \ interesting. I decided on two of the stencil arts, bought them and while he was\
  \ packing them for me, I noticed a small table with some sort of tools lined up.\n\
  \n\u201CWhat is that for?\u201D\n\n\u201COh ! It is for the classes we conduct here.\
  \ I teach traditional Laotian stencil art\u201D\n\nHearing that, the conversation\
  \ I found distracting had now piqued my curiosity. I bombarded him with so many\
  \ questions, he laughed, asked me to stay back for dinner and join his friends.\
  \ My enthusiasm to know more and his friendly smile instantly made me plop down\
  \ the chair he offered. His store and classroom converted into a dining room. His\
  \ wife and three year old son emerged from the basement that was his home, joined\
  \ us with some freshly made local food.\n\nHe explained that each paper was folded\
  \ into half to replicate the same pattern without repeating the work and was cut\
  \ very delicately into a pattern with the help of sharp long rectangular tools.\
  \ These were then used to create paintings onto temples. Most of the stencils would\
  \ have some mythological creatures or patterns which would be connected to certain\
  \ ceremonies. I thought of all the art in Jain temples in my hometown, completely\
  \ different in their implementation, but at the same time, intricate in the nature\
  \ of design. I mentioned the same and the conversation shifted from art to religion,\
  \ Buddhism and Jainism and how they were similar in so many beliefs like renouncing\
  \ worldly pleasures, attaining moksha and promoting peace.\n\nHis friend Ubon joined\
  \ us, surprised at seeing an unknown face but welcoming nonetheless.\n\n\u201CDo\
  \ you drink beer?\u201D\n\nBeer Lao? I asked. I\u2019d been drinking the local beer\
  \ and I had grown a liking to its texture. They were pleasantly surprised at my\
  \ knowledge and popped open four bottles. Anousith\u2019s son in my lap, we\u2019\
  re now talking about Ubon\u2019s girlfriend who was giving him trouble. They asked\
  \ my advice to gain a different perspective.\n\nPop went a new round of beers, I\
  \ faintly remember asking them whether Laos is pronounced with an S or if the S\
  \ is silent. And for the life of me I cannot remember what the answer was.\n\nWhat\
  \ I do remember, is the warmth and kindness shown to an absolute stranger. Even\
  \ with the vast lingual differences, we spoke a common language of art, relationships\
  \ and surprisingly, religion.\n\nWhile the world fights in the name of religion,\
  \ I made friends over the same and took back vivid memories of a day that ended\
  \ beautifully with promises to meet again."
