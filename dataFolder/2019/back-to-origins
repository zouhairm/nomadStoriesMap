Text: "I finally land in Mexico D.F., the country where I return after 33 years. I\
  \ left it when I was 6 months old. I was eager to return where I first saw the light\
  \ on this planet. A damp heat encompasses me immediately. I discover a  city full\
  \ of lights, colors, perfumes, the perfectly blend of people's fragrances with the\
  \ landscape: flowers, fruits, houses.\nOn the streets, I encounter people full of\
  \ joy, smiling on the streets. They might be people who may not have much, but show\
  \ happiness.\nI came to Mexico for a volunteer project for an NGO for two months.\
  \ I went to a fruit young man seller and asked him if he knows where I can found\
  \ accommodation. I was surprised to see how this man who did not know me at all,\
  \ leave his stall and came with me on the next street to a lady he knew asking her\
  \ if she had a place in her house for me to stay. He came together with his little\
  \ girl and full of joy they conduct me there. I did not know what to expect, as\
  \ usually, people are not so willing to live their work and help the others. Luckily,\
  \ his help made me quickly find a home. I live with this local woman, Fernanda and\
  \ I had the opportunity to experiment what means family for her. It is all about\
  \ feeling together with good and with bad, about sharing and caring. I knew few\
  \ things about the Mexican people culture, but the most important thing is to feel\
  \ it with your own senses. She was cooking the meals for her family every day, but\
  \ she also was going to the market to sell fruit juices for the people, in order\
  \ to have some money. Fernanda is a brave woman, I did not learn from her how to\
  \ cook guacamole, but also how to enjoy it together with her and her family.\nOne\
  \ day I went to a trip to Oaxaca, where I understood they keep a lot of traditions\
  \ from their ancestors. Arriving there I went to a hostel only dedicated to women.\
  \ I asked the lady manager, Maria:\n-Why just women?\n-Women should be protected,\
  \ she replied. And here you can find it as place where women can feel good even\
  \ if you travel alone or just with only other women.\nI was very inspired about\
  \ all the explanations I receive from Maria. In her 50\u2019s, she gave me a lesson\
  \ about simple life. To live a life the way you want, surrounded by the people who\
  \ makes you be good, feeling inspired to do great things for others, are just few\
  \ tips she share with me. I simply love them.\n\nMy visit to Mexico was a return\
  \ to my soul, a positive energy charging about life and about how it can be lived.\
  \ I did not expected to find this, but I was happily surprised. I experienced a\
  \ Mexico full of balance, simplicity and kindness. More detailed stories in a future\
  \ episodes, if you give me the chance to tell them to you."
