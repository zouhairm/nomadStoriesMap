  It's easy because I've always wanted it, and because everything is ready, I don\u2019\
  t need anything , only prepare my bags\nBut it is also difficult, how can I leave\
  \ my parents who haven\u2019t gone away for a moment since I was born, is not this\
  \ difficult?\n....\n-i made the decision to travel and to accepted the scholarship\
  \ , I left my family and went to the plane to see them and my eyes tell them that\
  \ I will never forget them\non the plane I met a girl who was sitting beside me\
  \ called Julia, who found me tense and wanted to calm me down\nJulia: Do not worry,\
  \ you'll be fine\nNada :I hope so\njulia :Is it the first time to travel abroad?\n\
  Nada : Yes, and that's why I feel a bit scared\nJulia: I travel a lot, forget that\
  \ feeling, but you will love to travel, we are created to see everything that is\
  \ beautiful and to look at all people and nationalities, isn\u2019t it?\nNada :\
  \ of course \n- My talk with Julia made me gain some confidence that I needed to\
  \ feel ..\nWhen the plane landed and I saw how many french people I had always watched\
  \ only on my television, I met someone who was with me in the scholarship\nhe was\
  \ a bit sexy, quiet not speaking too much\nFadi: I apologize for interfering in\
  \ your life, but I want you to go with me to enjoy Paris a bit\nNada : But you have\

  \ Sure, let's have a little fun\nWe used to walk together in the streets of Paris\
  \ and see people, who reflect all aspects of love, as if I really want to call it\
  \ the country of love, whenever I look I find Lovers  , who laughs and who quarrels\
  \ and who carries his love and who accepts The hand of his sweetheart and the one\
  \ who tries to hold on to the hand of his lover and the other one who trying to\
  \ get away from his hands\nI was watching all the situations of \u201Clove\u201D\
  \ \n...\n the days passed very fast ..\nin one day fadi asked me to go out with\
  \ him to see the eiffel  tower \n..\nI haven\u2019t seen such beauty like that in\
  \ my whole life , that was like a dream , a high-end tower mixed with love . \n\
  We went to write our wishes and lock it with the key\nFadi: What is your wish ?\n\

  \ how i found my soulmate in the city of love .\n it wasn\u2019t just a journey\
  \ , it was a dream emerged with hope and confidence that i can travel and depend\
  \ on myself ."
