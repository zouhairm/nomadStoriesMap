Text: "The life of a working woman is very mundane in India, she gets her fair share\
  \ of involvement in all the household chores and office work; the only travelling\
  \ opportunity comes with the work related travelling that really doesn\u2019t leave\
  \ room for your heart\u2019s content.\n\nThis year I needed a break from this routine\
  \ and decided to take a vacation, I packed my small travel kit and left for Darjeeling,\
  \ the surreal hill destination in north Bengal. Darjeeling is 2 hours\u2019 drive\
  \ from Siligudi, the nearest airport. On 31st December when we cam out of Siligudi,\
  \ the Himalayan cold breeze welcomed us in the morning 5.00 A.M. In place of sharing\
  \ the two hours with a lot of strangers, we thought it will be great if we book\
  \ a cab and take several breaks on the road.\n\nThe driver was from Siligudi only\
  \ and a regular one on the route. We started our journey with the tunes of retro\
  \ Bollywood music on the car radio. The driver, Hari, was not only the one taking\
  \ us to our destination but guiding us in the unknown path as well. He gave us detail\
  \ of every point on the road where some burglary took place in past, every blind\
  \ turn where some accident happened, every small tea stall and their authenticity\
  \ and variation of price of the real Darjeeling tea. We already told him we wanted\
  \ to enjoy good tea on the way, and we halted at a small homestay restaurant. In\
  \ the background of the hills it was looking like a picture from a calendar, I used\
  \ to see in my childhood. On one side of the road the snowflakes from last night\
  \ was winking with white sunlight. The added incentive was the tea and the home-made\
  \ breakfast, it was quite cheap compared to other parts of India. Two girls with\
  \ their apple red cheeks were running the restaurant and we came to know one of\
  \ them is about to marry our taxi driver. I think in every cold place, you will\
  \ find out the warmth in your way, we were lucky to find the warmth of love.\n\n\
  After half an hour, we started for Darjeeling. The journey was quite hectic and\
  \ a filled belly made me a little dizzy. But I got startled with our driver shouting\
  \ after sometime, \u201CSister, don\u2019t fall asleep, we don\u2019t know how lucky\
  \ you are. Just see outside.\u201D With half open eyes I looked beyond the window\
  \ glass, and that was the most awestruck moment of my life till date.\n\nKanchanjangha\
  \ at her best, with snow on her peek brightened with morning sunlight. Being someone\
  \ living in plain lands, I have never seen such a majestic view. Hari shared that\
  \ Kanchanjangha wasn\u2019t visible in last week because of the snowfall and cloudy\
  \ weather. Our journey began at that point, with an unforgettable view of the proud\
  \ Himalayan beauty looking at us. The song playing in the car radio was just in\
  \ tune with us, \u2018Oh, where have I come, after walking together so long.\u2019"
