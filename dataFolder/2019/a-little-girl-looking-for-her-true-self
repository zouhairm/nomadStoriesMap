  \ small Italian city. She loves her position, but at the same time she know that\
  \ this life is not her really life. She is constantly struggling with herself and\
  \ her thoughts. \nSo in a cold day of December after an hard quarrel with his parents\
  \ she decides to keep her courage and go away from all the people she knows. The\
  \ same people who bring her a lot of problems day by day; the same people who let\
  \ her think that life is not so beautiful. But she knows that it's not so. And after\
  \ some days of mediating and crying she decides to left all the bad things behind\
  \ her and go away from her prison to be a new person, to discover herself and make\
  \ her life happier and free. \nSo she takes the first flight to Damascus to achieve\
  \ her dream. \nThis dream is the dream of her life, she has always wanted to go\
  \ to those lands raped by the war to help people in difficulty, especially the young\
  \ people; all the children to whom the war takes away their childhood and their\
  \ freedom.\nYes, because this little girl has always wanted to being free through\
  \ her actions. \nSo she contact her Syrian friend to have a support, to find a job\
  \ and to have some information to start her adventure.\nIn fact after a month she\
  \ starts to volunteer in a shelter center for children affected by the war and orphans.\n\
  During the nights spent in that center she realizes that now she's a new girl, she's\
  \ growing, she feels that she's a woman now. An happy and free woman!\nShe's finding\
  \ herself there and with the same grit of when she took the flight to Damascus she\
  \ decides to spend all the time of her life there, in the midst of those people,\
  \ those child, those poor and unfortunate innocent.\nBecause only in that way this\
  \ little girl she's finding her really self. \nAnd so, now, this little girl is\
