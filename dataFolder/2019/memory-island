Text: "Working in international development, I often have the opportunity to travel.\
  \ This travel can be divided into two categories; nondescript conference centres\
  \ in grey European cities that eventually blur into one, and places that seem to\
  \ fall on the wayside of the \u2018tourist trail.\u2019 These are often the places\
  \ where real life seems to be happening in all its vibrant, chaotic and sometimes\
  \ problematic glory. In amongst the places that I\u2019ve been lucky enough to visit,\
  \ \xCEle de Gor\xE9e has captivated me the most.\n\nThe conference was to be held\
  \ on the outskirts of Dakar and as we flew over the jagged, undulating dunes of\
  \ the Western Sahara desert, I was hypnotised into a sense of intrigue and restless\
  \ eagerness. The thirsty, red earth looked like it had been burnt ten times over,\
  \ yet it had survived, with a new crack on its surface each time to show for its\
  \ achievement. Our time in Dakar began in a cocoon of windowless conference rooms\
  \ discussing abstract concepts and unrelatable ideas, for days on end only catching\
  \ glimpses of the city through minibus windows. By the end of the week, I knew I\
  \ had to immerse myself in the buzz and dust that I could palpably feel each time\
  \ I stepped outside.  It was this same dust I could taste on my tongue and smell\
  \ in the air as I boarded the boat to \xCEle de Gor\xE9e, having broken free from\
  \ the conference for the last day. Full to bursting point with people carrying animals,\
  \ food and wares to sell from the mainland, I found a space next to a woman carrying\
  \ a baby in a homemade papoose. She looked at my bare legs and gestured wordlessly\
  \ for me to stand, before placing a scarf underneath me to save my skin from burning\
  \ on the scorched plastic seat.  I watched as Dakar faded into the horizon\u2019\
  s haze with each lurch forward of the struggling boat. Half an hour into the journey,\
  \ from my vantage point on the top deck, I suddenly noticed a deluge of black liquid\
  \ seeping out from underneath the vessel. It was as if the boat immediately sensed\
  \ my panic as it spluttered, juddered and honked its deafening horn before coming\
  \ to a peaceful, resounding stop. Just five metres from the island\u2019s wooden\
  \ pier, there was a brief pause as we collectively looked around for a captain to\
  \ defer to, before people realising there wasn\u2019t one, swarmed to one side of\
  \ the boat to see if they could make the jump. Passengers began throwing their goods\
  \ to people on the pier who had already formed an assembly line of outstretched\
  \ arms. Suddenly, in amongst the shouting, a deep splash split the air. I closed\
  \ my eyes briefly, praying that no one had fallen or thrown a badly behaved dog\
  \ or goat overboard, before a loud cheer rose from the crowd on the pier. I peered\
  \ over with my fellow passengers to see a woman with a bundle of cloths tied on\
  \ her head, waving and laughing back up at the boat. She turned in the water and\
  \ began to swim to the shore. I let my eyes follow her to the lip of the beach,\
  \ where for the first time since we had approached the shoreline, I noticed swathes\
  \ of people, young and old, frolicking in the jade water. I lifted my eyes to the\
  \ rest of the island, raising my hand to block out the oppressive sun. I breathed\
  \ in the red, yellow and oranges of the ramshackled houses that mixed with the uncomfortable\
  \ elegance of island's colonial past. It was hard to fathom whilst witnessing the\
  \ jovial scenes by the water\u2019s edge, that this was once the backdrop to some\
  \ of the darkest times in humanity\u2019s history. The slave house, nestled above\
  \ the sharp rocks stood to serve as a purposeful reminder. As no cars trespassed\
  \ here, people and animals alike kicked through the hot dirt to the water that satiated\
  \ the sand. Before I could talk myself out of it, I\u2019d discarded my shoes and\
  \ leapt off the side of the boat, to the sound of children laughing and splashing\
  \ in the cool waters."
