Text: "I met Ramat in the Gothic Quarter, outside the club Tarantos where my friend,\
  \ her sister and I had spent the past hour watching salsa dancing. He was short\
  \ and barrel chested, with a well-groomed dark beard and intense brown eyes. An\
  \ artist\u2019s eyes: piercing and mischievous. I was told before we met that he\
  \ was a professional painter. It wasn\u2019t difficult to see that, judging by the\
  \ flecks of paint under his short fingernails and the calculating way his gaze rested\
  \ on my cheekbone.\n\n \tIt was our last night in Barcelona; we were boarding a\
  \ train for Paris first thing in the morning. The air was warm and humid, a pleasant\
  \ change from my native dry Rocky Mountain air, and Plaza Real was bustling. Cafes\
  \ brimmed with patrons, young couples walked arm and arm, and street vendors launched\
  \ brightly lit toy orbs into the sky trying to convince us that our lives would\
  \ be incomplete without them. After a round of sangrias and a shared pan of paella,\
  \ Ramat invited us to his studio.\n\n        He told the taxi to stop once for Albari\xF1\
  o and cigarettes, and soon our small parade was climbing stairs into an industrial\
  \ warehouse.  \n\n \tThe studio was a long rectangular room, divided by semi-permanent\
  \ partitions and ornate tapestries. Painting supplies littered the space. Finished\
  \ canvases lined the far wall, which was made entirely of windows, and metal shelves\
  \ were stacked high with drop cloths, oil paints, buckets of brushes and wooden\
  \ canvas frames. A small alcove housed overflowing bookcases, a small table with\
  \ a nearly full ashtray and an old piano. Ramat changed out of his street clothes\
  \ into baggy jean shorts, paint-splattered shirt and newsboy cap. He stood smoking\
  \ a cigarette, studying me. \n\n\t\u201CI don\u2019t normally paint with yellow,\
  \ but I really like the colors in your dress.\u201D\n\n        His palette decided,\
  \ he put up a blank canvas, turned on his floor lamps, poured the Albari\xF1o and\
  \ began to sketch. His friend Jose, who had joined us at dinner, was a professional\
  \ Spanish guitarist. He picked up one of the several guitars in the studio and started\
  \ to play. Long, thin fingers glided across the strings with the familiarity of\
  \ a longtime lover.\n\n\tMy friend had her sketchbook; she and her sister sat at\
  \ the little table, the ashtray pushed aside, sharing the confined space with Jose\
  \ as I walked through the room with my camera, all of us watching Ramat at work.\
  \ Quick bursts and lines of charcoal took form on the canvas, the image in his mind\
  \ coming to life before us. The bright floodlights cast harsh shadows against the\
  \ ceiling as his hand moved across the canvas. Ramat painted, Jose played, my friend\
  \ sketched, I photographed.\n \n        Around midnight, the painting was complete.\
  \ Long dark lines of women flowed from the top to the bottom, with canary yellow,\
  \ chestnut brown and rosy pinks accentuating their abstract forms. Ramat turned\
  \ and smiled, \u201CNow it\u2019s time we dance\u201D.\n\n \t I\u2019ve always loved\
  \ the way Spaniards dance -- with passion and intensity, completely free and unrestrained.\
  \ While the guitar is playing, the partner and the music are the only things that\
  \ matter.  I can still feel the weight of Ramat\u2019s hand against the small of\
  \ my back, leading me with grace and strength. We danced, we drank, we laughed.\n\
  \ \n         I stepped out onto the fire escape to catch my breath, invigorated\
  \ by the cool pre-dawn air off the Mediterranean. I gazed at the empty streets below,\
  \ letting my whole experience of Barcelona sink in. Like the painting that came\
  \ to life before my eyes, the city was filled with color, fluidity and vibrant life.\
  \ Our train left soon, but I wanted to stay in this moment as long as I could. The\
  \ chances of our meeting Ramat and his companions again were slim, and I wondered\
  \ what would happen to that beautiful painting.\n\n         But that was a question\
  \ for tomorrow. I was living for this night."
