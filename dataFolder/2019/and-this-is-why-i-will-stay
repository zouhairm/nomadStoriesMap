Text: "Two days ago I drew the mountains while sitting by the fireplace, folk music\
  \ playing on the speakers.\n\nYesterday I volunteered in a hostel labeling cleaning\
  \ products.\n\nAnd somehow, both felt as nice; let me introduce you to my new life.\n\
  \nIt's been two months since I arrived in New Zealand. After multiple road-trips,\
  \ one Ferry and some Couchsurfing experiences, I'm in this town I now call home:\
  \ Franz Josef.\n\nToday my new friends have lighted a fire, we've got an hour until\
  \ sunset at the beach, 20 minutes from Franz Josef.\n\nFranz Josef, this great but\
  \ small little town. A passing through place, where everyone just comes and goes;\
  \ tourists will stay a couple of nights, Woofers a couple of weeks... since I've\
  \ arrived, I've already seen ten friends leave.\n\nFranz Josef and its misty mountain\
  \ tops, its only two roads but its more than ten hikes. Its six or seven restaurants,\
  \ its bunch of motels and hotels and backpackers caravan's dreamland. Karaoke and\
  \ pizza night on Fridays, ''Open mic Wednesdays''. Monsoon's pool table and to Snakebite's\
  \ beer.\n\nSunsets here are always amazing, and most of the days pink and blue are\
  \ its predominant colors. From wherever I am, I can look out of the window and see\
  \ a mountain. Any room, any window, I'm surrounded by them. I hear birds I have\
  \ never heard before, they make beautiful unique noises. I see stars I have never\
  \ seen before, just walking 5 minutes away from the town lights, over the bridge,\
  \ where only the dark is around you.\n\nI just love it here, roller-coaster place;\
  \ peace and quiet, rain and lightning.\n\nPeople here are adventurous. If they are\
  \ not working they are hiking or making bonfires at the beach. I've met some guys\
  \ who own a three-wheeler, a kayak, and a fishing rod. How cool is that, so cool!\n\
  \nTonight, after the sun is gone, we're going to the Rainforest bar for dinner.\
  \ I love choosing from the menu, I could even call it a hobby. \nI like coming to\
  \ the bar - you never know what to expect there (like cute long hair bartenders?!).\
  \ Sometimes it's calm and you feel all cozy and warm next to the fireplace and other\
  \ times one of the 'Kiwi Experience' buses arrives and it gets busy and noisy. The\
  \ music they play is so random. First, they'd play Avicii and after they'll surprise\
  \ you with a slow song by The Lumineers. So random, I love it.\n\nI might have found\
  \ what I was looking for, a home away from home; new friends I enjoy spending time\
  \ with, friends to share my old stories, and my new ones, friends around the world\
  \ to go visit when I'm tired of being stuck in one place again. \n\nLife feels good,\
  \ I'm excited for every little moment of it. I'm learning; I'm changing, adapting,\
  \ I'm really into this experience and I'm not missing anything. I find peace of\
  \ mind in the most unexpected moments: when trouble happens, when the fun happens,\
  \ when a storm happens, when nothing happens - I always end up finding it, so I\
  \ guess I'm in a good place. Nature inspires me.\n\nOnce again, I'm back to a new\
  \ start. Back to making mistakes, back at the beginning of my true self. Back where\
  \ I really enjoy the fall and the rise.\n\nBack at loving life - just trying to\
  \ live it the best I can. Where it revolves around nature, adventure, travel stories,\
  \ people, road trips, music, and love. So much love, love for everything.\n\nI am\
  \ how I am, how I want to be; how it always should be. I've got all the emotions\
  \ running through me.\n\nMy soul feels good, my body feels good - I feel great.\n\
  \nAnd now my new bed feels the most comfortable of all.\n\nI've made a painting\
  \ and hung it on the wall, and little by little, this little cabin I've been assigned,\
  \ feels more like a home.\n\nAnd yes Franz Josef is a passing through place, but\
  \ I've got a feeling that in my heart, it will always stay.\n\nAnd somebody told\
  \ me everyone ends up leaving. But me, I find myself staying."
