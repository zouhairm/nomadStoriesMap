Text: "\u201CI wonder whether the pattern below might be a mass of connections joining\
  \ me to some whole.\u201D\nDavid Beers, \u201CBlue Sky Dream\u201D\n\nSuburban,\
  \ Midwest American life is its own kind of magic. I grew up with sprinklers in vibrant\
  \ green front lawns, the neighbor\u2019s cerulean inflatable pool, and \u20188 and\
  \ under\u2019 summer soccer camp photos. The American middle class is Hollywood\u2019\
  s most overlooked treasure, easily replicated from every \u2018coming-of-age\u2019\
  \ film to the next Superman inclusion. However, no movie magic prepared me for the\
  \ day when I finally felt the urge to explore that great unknown beyond Milwaukee,\
  \ Wisconsin. \n\nOn my first airplane flight ever, my father leaned over my small\
  \ 5-year-old frame to the oval-shaped window and pointed outwards through the clouds.\
  \ He circled the lights below with his fingertip, like a magic wand casting a spell\
  \ over the world and glittering my eyes with a new, mystical perspective. I told\
  \ him they looked like the ants from my ant farm, ants with tiny fireplaces. There\
  \ were small houses and small neighborhoods where I couldn\u2019t quite see the\
  \ sprinklers or the pools anymore. Today, I think back and wonder if maybe those\
  \ ants were my own fictitious soulmates. Maybe, just maybe, we all shared a chapter\
  \ in the same story. \n\nWhen my father and I settled into our coffees on the morning\
  \ of my 21st birthday, I explained to him this \u201Cmissing link\u201D phenomena.\
  \ I used the ant analogy. I told him that the more I rose up into those airplanes,\
  \ I began to see how small I was in the grand scheme of the world just like the\
  \ ants. I was missing an all-inclusive understanding of life and home. There were\
  \ people who lived in much different places than me with no memories of ice cream\
  \ trucks traveling past a game of kickball on the playground in June. Each ant had\
  \ a different tunnel to dig and it became my job to link all those tunnels into\
  \ one big community.\n\nIn February 2019, I set off to find a new neighborhood of\
  \ ants like me. I arrived with carry-on in hand to Prague, Czech Republic and began\
  \ a new path. Today, I am writing the stories to connect us all and experience the\
  \ bigger picture. I\u2019ve written about beer culture in Prague and opinion pieces\
  \ on economics in the United Kingdom to the business of wine in Europe. My wanderlust\
  \ has carried me from the shores of Reykjavik, Iceland through the streets of London,\
  \ England and beyond. \n\nHowever, no matter how far I\u2019ve traveled, I\u2019\
  ll never forget that first look at the world below our very feet. The ant farm analogy\
  \ has lingered in the back of my mind. Now, it\u2019s time to return back to my\
  \ roots and delve into what it means to be a human in this giant home that we call\
  \ Earth. It\u2019s time to connect all these chapters into one big narrative of\
  \ humanity. \n\nCheers,\nCharolette Fletcher"
