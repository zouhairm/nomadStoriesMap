Text: "The day had arrived. I was on a rickety old train, six hours of pristine Galician\
  \ countryside floating past. I lay my head against the dusty window which had been\
  \ scratched by the branches of the overhanging trees that outlined the train\u2019\
  s path. There was something reassuring in the fact the seat had clearly served as\
  \ a head rest for hundreds of weary travellers before me and yet exciting that the\
  \ view from it was ever changing with each new pair of eyes. I had been imagining\
  \ this day for months. Creating an image in my head so detailed that I was almost\
  \ confused by looking at the reality. It wasn\u2019t worse than what I\u2019d imagined.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t better. Just different. Instead of trying to take a photo of it\
  \ on my phone, I just watched and entrusted my memory to capture the moments. The\
  \ expanse of greens and blues separated only by the dark blurry line of the ocean\
  \ in the distance, all merged into one endless watercolour painting. On one side\
  \ of me was a towering mass of alpine trees that looked as though they should be\
  \ covered in a thick blanket of snow and surrounded by ski tracks; the other, the\
  \ potential for a Havana beach party and cocktails at sunset.  The contrast between\
  \ the urban and rural landscapes I saw on this trainline astounded me. There was\
  \ no graduation from the industrial to the agricultural. It was as though a film\
  \ editor had carelessly cut from one scene to the next without connecting them.\n\
  \ \nFinally arriving at my destination and fuelled only by a stale synthetic baked\
  \ good and a Spanish version of 7 Up, I was starting to fade. In an attempt to revive\
  \ my sense of adventure, I decided to dump my luggage in my new apartment and head\
  \ straight out into the town to explore.\nIn Galicia, the Northern most region of\
  \ Spain and hidden in the northern most point of Galicia, sitting on the shores\
  \ of the Cantabrian sea, is the modest fishing town of Burela and my home for the\
  \ next nine months. There was something confusing in the way that Burela had a calming\
  \ quality but seemed to have an unsettling eeriness at the same time; almost like\
  \ walking into a house with its lights on and the kettle boiling but discovering\
  \ that no one is home. The town itself was an odd mix of modern homes and abandoned\
  \ shells of buildings that were plastered with \u201CFor sale\u201D or \u201CFor\
  \ rent\u201D signs.  As I continued, I discovered that most of the town consisted\
  \ mainly of cafes, bakeries and the odd hardware store displaying shopping trollies\
  \ for the elderly. The thought that I may be bringing the average age of the town\
  \ down at least fifty years somewhat dampened my earlier excitement, but I resolved\
  \ to stay positive, so I decided to go for a drink. \n\nThe owner, a refreshingly\
  \ content looking man in his sixties approached and asked what I wanted; to which\
  \ I replied in my non-native Spanish \u201CGreen Tea, please\u201D. Clearly obvious\
  \ to him then that I was not a \u2018local\u2019 he struck up a conversation. According\
  \ to him, this town, although appearing nearly deserted, had much history and enough\
  \ popular festivals and traditions to ensure enough income year-round. It seemed\
  \ strange to me, that a business owner living in a town as quiet as this could be\
  \ as optimistic as he was. All in all, my first impression of Burela was that life\
  \ in this simple town was just as slow and rickety and unbelievably colourful as\
  \ the train journey it took to reach it. \n\nI sat at a table outside the caf\xE9\
  \ letting the tea calm my nerves as the dust from my travels began to settle around\
  \ me. This town was a puzzle to me. I loved the feeling that although many had been\
  \ here before me, many more would never even know its name. The quiet, untouched\
  \ mystery of it was what made it so beautiful and yet, it was this exact beauty\
  \ that would likely be its eventual downfall. I was excited to make my mark."
