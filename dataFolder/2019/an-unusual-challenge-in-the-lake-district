Text: "It started at my part-time job; a local UPS store in the USA. A friendly older\
  \ gentleman and I struck up a conversation about the film cameras that he was shipping\
  \ out. As a camera nerd myself, I found that it was easy to converse with this eccentric\
  \ man, regardless of his deafness. A few months later after further email and in-person\
  \ conversations with him, a Leica M3, my ideal film camera fell into my hands. His\
  \ overwhelming generosity took me back. I couldn't afford to buy this from him,\
  \ and it would be too much to just accept it as a gift, but he gave me a challenge,\
  \ and it would be officially mine. He handed me a photograph. \"Find this place\
  \ and photograph it with the camera.\" He said with a playful smirk. I had no idea\
  \ where to begin. It was a nondescript series of rolling green hills with a bright\
  \ blue sky and larger grassy peaks in the background. After some searching online\
  \ and questions to friends online. I found it! It was a view from the top of Catbells\
  \ Walk in the Lake District of Northern England. Now I just needed to get there.\
  \ \n\nMy wife and I love to travel as it is, so it was easy to convince her to travel\
  \ to the Lake District after she finished her Masters dissertation in Scotland.\
  \ Only a three hour train from home, we made a weekend trip of it. Without a car,\
  \ we relied heavily on public transportation and this was no different. Staying\
  \ in a large homestead deep in the valleys of the District, there was only one bus\
  \ every so many minutes and none ran after six o'clock in the evening. This put\
  \ a large strain on our travel plans on top of the incessant rain that plagued us\
  \ from the moment we arrived. It looked like getting to Catbells was going to be\
  \ very difficult if not impossible that weekend. Even if we got to the top, would\
  \ we be able to see anything there? How would I get a picture to match?\n\nThe next\
  \ morning we struck up a long conversation with a young American couple sitting\
  \ next to us at the breakfast table. Also adventure seekers, Jake and Amber agreed\
  \ to give us a lift to town and meet up later if the weather turned to our favor.\
  \ Sure enough, after lunch the sky broke open to bright blue sky and white clouds.\
  \ We decided it was worth a shot. Their rental car made the trip so much easier,\
  \ and we found the trail easily. As we started our hike I grew increasingly optimistic\
  \ and Jake's adventurous enthusiasm added to my excitement. With each crested hill,\
  \ I turned around to survey the landscape. \"Almost,\" I'd say to myself. Soon the\
  \ terrain grew rockier and the wind picked up. The four of us cautiously chose our\
  \ next foot placements. Finally we saw the top with its small obelisk. I turned\
  \ around and watched the sun break through a series of clouds into the valley. The\
  \ lake was to my right and the valley where we started was in front of me. It was\
  \ it. It was the photograph. I could have held it up in front of me and saw the\
  \ same scene staring back at me. We had made it. I took a photograph on the Leica\
  \ M3. I had made it and made lifelong friends along the way. We stayed up there\
  \ for almost a half hour, taking everything in and trying not to get blown off the\
  \ top. If it hadn't been for a random happening back in the USA, I might not have\
  \ even heard of this place, let alone gone to visit and experience it. It's one\
  \ of those places you really have to see in person, photographs just don't quite\
  \ do it justice."
