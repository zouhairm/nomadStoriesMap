Text: "Arriving in Kashmir as a solo female traveller is something I had been warned\
  \ against but I had not realised how it had the potential to turn out to be particularly\
  \ fateful given the travel dates I had chosen. \n\nI was thrilled as I landed in\
  \ Srinagar in the second week of July, 2016 in the wee hours of morning. Matt, my\
  \ clueless co-passenger, a British national and avid traveller had flown into Srinagar\
  \ without much of an itinerary. \nExiting the Sheikh Ul Alam International airport,\
  \ the absence of a heavy \u2018touristy\u2019 crowd did strike me as odd and I do\
  \ vaguely remember hearing the word \u2018curfew\u2019 in whispers but decided to\
  \ not pay much heed as it was not a taboo word in this part of the world. \nA shared\
  \ smoke and a few travel stories later he recounted his travails of navigating through\
  \ the by-lanes of old Delhi; his pocket being picked, him being misguided when he\
  \ asked for directions and consequently missing his bus and locals making fun of\
  \ him due to (he thought) his skin colour that didn\u2019t belong. \u201CAs if the\
  \ Indians were still avenging their colonial past\u201D, he gave a hollow laugh.\
  \  \nIt stung. I was chagrined at Matt having been duped in the capital city of\
  \ my country.\nHe was, however, awed by my copy of the Indian map.  \nI was horrified\
  \ to learn that wasn\u2019t how they drew the Indian map in the west. For us Indians\
  \ Kashmir existed in two fragments: Kashmir and Pakistan occupied Kashmir (I had\
  \ recently learned in the wake of escalated tensions between the two countries that\
  \ in Pakistan they knew of \u2018their\u2019 Kashmir and the \u2018India occupied\u2019\
  \ one) and that day I learnt that the rest of the world doesn\u2019t include most\
  \ parts of \u2018our\u2019 Kashmir in the Indian map. It was a harrowing realisation\
  \ how maps changed with the crossing of borders. \nWe arrived at the Dal lake and\
  \ the mesmerising beauty of the lake and the shikaras was picturesque and we walked\
  \ to our accommodation in the Ghanta Ghar (clock tower) area thereafter, soaking\
  \ in the local culture, strolling through the markets. \nWe had to cancel our plans\
  \ of going to the old city in the afternoon and visiting the Jama Masjid as the\
  \ news of stone pelting and aggravated violence directed against the police forces\
  \ had started pouring in. \nI was enveloped by a strange sense of panic at the thought\
  \ of missing the Kargil and onward leg of the trip to Leh and sleep seemed elusive\
  \ that night. It was strange how commonplace this whole affair was seeming to the\
  \ hotel staff and people around me. A group of them casually discussed the peltings\
  \ and \u2018areas to be avoided\u2019. \nIn the morning I bade my goodbye to Matt\
  \ and my hosts and began searching for a taxi that would take me through Sonmarg\
  \ and Dras to Kargil. I found one soon and though for slightly higher than usual\
  \ fare, he agreed to make the trip. \nI was throwing up by the time we reached Dras\
  \ and had to halt. Having gone without food since the beginning of day mixed with\
  \ tiredness and the cold, it seemed. The hutments of the settlers there were made\
  \ of mud and local wood. A woman offered to make me a simple meal of rice-lentil\
  \ (khichdi) seeing my condition.\nThe air had acquired a chill, caressing our faces\
  \ with its pristine pleasantness. On the road outside were two boys, carting the\
  \ rubber of a cycle tyre with a wooden stick. The temperature would have easily\
  \ hovered over 5-6 degrees celsius but they wore nothing save the phirans which\
  \ covered them from necks to calves giving the appearance of gunny sacks having\
  \ undergone a thread and needle something. \nAs the shadows grew long, we commenced\
  \ our onward drive. I thought back over the eventfulness the trip had presented\
  \ so far. The hospitality of the locals of humble means had my bitterness dissolved;\
  \ that which Matt\u2019s unpleasant Delhi experience had caused. The sight of the\
  \ lofty Himalayan peaks had left me feeling dwarfed at my seemingly infinitesimal\
  \ existence and yet more alive than I had ever felt in life."
