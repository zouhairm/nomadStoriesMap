Text: "I took my travel journals, and beside my world map marked up with colored pins,\
  \ I remember all the stories I have had traveling through many cities. \nAfter 10\
  \ years of my first travel and Erasmus experience at Madrid, I was on this life\
  \ experience, new travels, friends and stories. Me and my suitcase, we were in front\
  \ of a \u201Cnew world\u201D, not knowing anything, we were on the uncertainty of\
  \ the unknown, it was a scary bitter-sweet passion that was firing my soul. \n\n\
  When I depart I had one task my pending pins on my worldmap were Portugal and Africa.\
  \ So close to Spain, to be in one of the Europe frontiers and of walking another\
  \ continent and breathing the experience. When I was at Gibraltar, a small UK city\
  \ part of Spain\u2019s land, and I found myself so close to Africa, I decided to\
  \ go first to that continent, eventhough I was only for a day there. So, I looked\
  \ for it, I booked, and I woke up early to start the adventure. \n\nI arrive to\
  \ the location on Andaluc\xEDa Avenue, one of the main Malaga streets and\u2026\
  \ depart with a bunch of strangers. I remembered I was kind of nervous, that kind\
  \ of not knowing nervous and to be true, I also was kind of worried of my safety,\
  \ but nothing stopped my adventure hunger and green pin map objective. We arrived\
  \ at the ship that was crossing us the Mediterranean Sea, destination Tanger. \n\
  \nI remember the feeling when I see the new land, thinking of the many people that\
  \ through the pass of centuries and years have had arrived with different feelings\
  \ and new adventures in front. \n\nThe journey started with the (typical) tourist\
  \ guide, we were guarded, and he take us the most representative places. The classy\
  \ and Embassy homes, the old town city center, a market, to a typical restaurant\
  \ where I ate lamb and local food, and finally to a corporal and facial argain oil\
  \ shop. \nDuring my travels, I decided to feel any place that I step on, walking\
  \ the experience living the present moment, learning from other culture and understanding\
  \ \u201Cstep by step\u201D of each story that has been told, each history that has\
  \ been lived there in each tour, museums visits and places I have been.\n\nI remember\
  \ the departure, the last step that my feet were stand on Tanger ground, I knew\
  \ hise was only a tasting of which will be a longer stay on many of the great cities\
  \ that Africa has for our human kind as travelers in this world.\n\nI came back\
  \ and my time to visit Portugal was on the countdown to fly back home. A, now friend\
  \ of mine, wanted to travel too, so we decided to take a train to Sevilla, beautiful\
  \ alive Spain city. And there, we were going to decide how to arrive to Portugal.\
  \ We took our suitcase and arrived at Sevilla. \nWe faced the frustration of not\
  \ knowing and the challenge that is to travel from Spain to Portugal, not as easy\
  \ as any American continent citizen can assume based on the distance between these\
  \ two countries. So, we look for car rides, trains, buses, and by some time we started\
  \ to fade away the illusion of arriving Portugal, any city, the frontier, any place\
  \ of this country. \n\nThere is when we decided to rent a car. I decided to drive\
  \ and is has been one of the best experiences in my whole live, to decide towards\
  \ life, take the lead and make it happen. \n\nIt was kind of exciting road trip,\
  \ crossing Sevilla and Spain through small and beautiful frontier towns. I remember\
  \ crossing the border, I remember driving one of the largest bridges in Europe,\
  \ Puente Vasco de Gama and April 25th. I remember breathing Lisbon\u2026 by know,\
  \ and between more than 20 cities I\xB4ve known in Europe, one of the most charming\
  \ places that I had walk, felt and breath. I will never forget Cristo Rey, Lisbon\u2019\
  s amazing entrance nor Sintra city. The people, the colors, the tile, the avenues,\
  \ the history. But that story\u2026 will continue."
