Text: "It all started as a normal trip which ended up in me being lost in a deep forest.\n\
  \nI woke up and came out of my room to see the most amazing view of a dam partially\
  \ filled with water and hills behind it.\n\nI got ready to start my day. We traveled\
  \ through the hills and narrow road and reached the end of the road from where we\
  \ had to walk. We had a forest guide join us and started the trek. After walking\
  \ for almost 2 hours we reached on top of a hill. This was the most beautiful place\
  \ i had seen in my life. We had a huge mountain in front of us a valley towards\
  \ our left and a dam towards our right. It was a lush green place. Nature was at\
  \ its best, the world's most breathtaking landscapes i had seen. I wanted to and\
  \ to capture this beauty through aerial shots and took out my drone and as soon\
  \ as it was in the air there was heavy wind and it took away the drone. \n\nThe\
  \ challenge before us was that it flew to a deep thick forest there was no way to\
  \ go inside also while on our way i have been told stories about locals spotting\
  \ tigers, black panthers and leopards. I was deeply saddened as i had just got this\
  \ drone. \n\nNext day with the help of few other folks we started the trek and searched\
  \ for close to 6 hours but we couldn't locate it. \n\nWe had to return back and\
  \ 7 days passed and i was trying all possible way to track it. I was loosing hope\
  \ in between i came across a  an option to locate the lost drone.\n\nI immediately\
  \ started working on it and called up folks and shared the location. They went again\
  \ and it was showing 20 meters from where they were standing in the valley of the\
  \ forest but then rain started pouring in and sunlight went off they had to call\
  \ if off. \n\nSame day i decided that i have to go and give it a last try.\n\nRushed\
  \ from office packed my bags and took a overnight bus. Reached there in the morning.\
  \  We collected water and food and drove for 2 hours and started the trek. \n\n\
  Walked for an hour and half and reached the top as soon as we were about to step\
  \ into the forest we spotted a tiger. I was really worried as i didn't want to risk\
  \ anyone's life for this. But i had to take a call. I was not sure if i will make\
  \ it back i had not informed my parents. \n\nFolks were waiting for me to take the\
  \ decision. One of the elder man in the group told me that if i am taking that next\
  \ step i should stay firm ignore your fears. \n  \nI decided to continue. We were\
  \ deep inside the forest, It was a risk, but i had to get my drone back i had invested\
  \ so much on it. We were trying to follow the map on the application and it was\
  \ guiding us towards where the drone had fallen. I never knew forest would be so\
  \ beautiful and scary at the same time. We walked for 8 hours, the most difficult\
  \ 8 ours of my life not knowing what was waiting for me as i was taking my next\
  \ step. We were running out of food and water, we saw places where bears would rest\
  \ and then we saw a small waterfall and filled our bottles and continued our journey.\
  \ Towards the evening we reached a wetland filled with weeds, there was no road\
  \ didn't know which direction to move and my legs were sinking. I remembered seeing\
  \ this place in the application when the drone was going down. I switched on the\
  \ remote control and heard a beep and then after searching for sometime  much we\
  \ found it there stuck between some plants. \n\nI was so happy that i never gave\
  \ up, The journey was not  be smooth but at the end it was successful. It was a\
  \ beautiful adventure."
