Text: "I needed a break from the hustle bustle of the city life and also from the\
  \ monotony of my life and so I backpacked to this amazing unexplored place of Himachal\
  \ Pradesh.\nI along with two of my friends had left from Delhi by car in the evening\
  \ and reached Kafnu in the morning to rest for the day at the guest house.\nThe\
  \ next day, we left the guest house by 6:30 am and could feel the chilly winds passing\
  \ by us.Within minutes,our fingers were almost frozen and we knew, it wasn\u2019\
  t going to be an easy one.But, yes! we were mentally and physically prepared for\
  \ this moderate-high level trek.\nWe had to buy a sleeping bag and mattress inorder\
  \ to spend the night in a small forest guest house there at Mulling.With alot of\
  \ adrenaline rush & neurons exploding,we head out to Mulling which was about 12\
  \ Kms from Kafnu and at the altitude of about 3300 m. The view was spectacular and\
  \ we had to trek through boulders of rocks for Kms (which made it a very tough call\
  \ for the knees),through forest,streams,glaciers and meadows.We had come across\
  \ coniferous trees and got the vista of the natural surroundings.\nThe trek is generally\
  \ covered in 6 hrs but we did it in 4 good hrs.I literally,tapped my back for this,as\
  \ the trek is suppose to be one of the most difficult treks in Himachal Pradesh\
  \ that changes its landscape at every turn and throws forth challenges to trekkers.Hence\
  \ it is recommended only for trekkers having prior experience of high altitude trekking\
  \ with proper skills and proper kits.\nWe however,reached Mulling and were so thrilled\
  \ to witness God\u2019s own creation that we just got lost in the moment.Our knees\
  \ were hurting badly & we were exhausted and thirsty(for we had carried limited\
  \ water bottles).\nThere was no shop there or even home stays or guest houses but\
  \ just one source to quench our thirst and that was the ice chilled stream running\
  \ by.We laid down on the meadows for hours enjoying the abode of nature,listening\
  \ to neighing of horses, the gushing sound of the stream and birds chirping.It was\
  \ a heavenly feeling to see the snow capped mountains and tall coniferous tress\
  \ & above all finally accomplishing the trek.After spending some ME time,we woke\
  \ up and dumbed our bagpacks in the forest guest house which was being renovated\
  \ then.It\u2019s the only place to spend the night there before heading for Kara\
  \ lake the next day.\nAt night we sat by the small fireplace and interacted with\
  \ the workers there and even joined them for dinner.\nWe got up the next morning\
  \ at 6:00 am to head forth to Kara Lake which was 5kms ahead but seemed like eternity\
  \ for me when I started it off, as my knees were hurting badly for I had strained\
  \ them covering the stretch from Kafnu to Mulling in about 4 hrs(thanks to those\
  \ boulders).I had gathered alot of strength and pushed aside the pain of my knees\
  \ and being a sportsperson, I din\u2019t want to call it quit after making it so\
  \ far.\nKara Lake is at an altitude of about 3700 m and is a 3 hr trek from Mulling.\
  \ We kept climbing through boulders and extremely narrow paths ( few inches extra\
  \ and you would face death) and while trekking,I avoided looking back or at the\
  \ depth as it took the hell out of me but at the same time I was feeling proud for\
  \ having made it so far.\nWOW! was the first word that struck our minds after reaching\
  \ Kara Lake and the view was breath taking.The beauty of it will be captured not\
  \ just in your eyes but even in your heart and soul for a lifetime. At the end,\
  \ I felt relieved for having pushed my limits for such a thrilling experience and\
  \ witnessing the creation of God.I was sitting in the lap of mother nature. It was\
  \ calm, pleasant, serene and not just this but I found myself in an entirely different\
  \ world. \n\nThis trek indeed helped me push my limits further and to accept challenges\
  \ on the face of adversity. It helped me explore myself."
