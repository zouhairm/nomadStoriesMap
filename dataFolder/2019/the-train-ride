Text: "The train ride starts. \nCologne to zurich. \n5 hours. \nPretty fast, right?\n\
  But something tells me that this 5 hours train ride contains more than it seems.\n\
  \nThis is my second big trip abroad within a few months. Before zurich I spent 6\
  \ months in Australia and New Zealand. Rounded up, in fact it were 5, but 6 sounded\
  \ more impressive, I thought. \nNothing special, right? \nAfter finishing high school\
  \ and before going to university and going to work and retirement experiencing something\
  \ thrilling and rememberable. As I found out, I wasn't the only one with this train\
  \ of thought.\nWell, that's not too bad, I figured.\n\nBut why is traveling, in\
  \ general, to experience something, such a trend?\n\nMy phone vibrates. \nI have\
  \ to leave. \nMannheim. \nChange trains. \nIt rains. \nWith a mellow \"I would like\
  \ to stay seated\" feeling I stumble outside.\n\n3,5 hours. Perhaps not so fast,\
  \ right?\n\nYou want to get out of your daily routine called life, meet new faces,\
  \ places and preferably seeing the entire world. However, I can't loose this feeling\
  \ that I run  away from something. Everybody does. The pressure to achieve something\
  \ special, but not too special, being afraid of the future. \n\nIs studying really\
  \ the right path to take?\nIs the person who I am happy? \nAm I deep down lonely\
  \ because I found great people, but not the right person? \n\nToo many questions,\
  \ I know. You want answers. I can only tell you how it doesn't work. \n\nRun. \n\
  Faster! \nThe raindrops patter against my face. \nLost my phone charger. Without\
  \ phone, no traveling. \nWhen your addicted to something you loose your free will\
  \ to decide. \nDoesn't matter. \n5 minutes until the train starts.\n\nThere is some\
  \ emptiness we try to fill. Some kind of desire, we're looking for at the wrong\
  \ place. This something is sense. The moments I felt some sort of sense were not\
  \ those when I was standing in front of the Sydney opera house or I got my new phone\
  \ (okay, maybe a little bit). But in the moments I felt some kind of love, when\
  \ I first met nice people in New Zealand, when I finally saw a good friend of mine\
  \ in Wellington, or when you come home after some time and meet your family again,\
  \ these where the moments, I enjoyed in a deeper sense the most. \n\nWarmth. \n\
  Got the train. \nGot the charging cable. \nThe nice conductor greets. \nNow the\
  \ train ride can continue.\n\nSo traveling doesn't make any sense? \nNo. I believe\
  \ traveling brings you further. Makes you more open-minded. The long joy after the\
  \ start of your tour gives way to the feeling of joy about your upcoming arrival.\
  \ Because I learned that it doesn't make sense to run away. But sometimes, you have\
  \ to run to come forth. \nAfter your run you have to take a deep breath. And this\
  \ is what you have to use. \n\nI leave the train. \nNeither cold nor warm. \nBut\
  \ that doesn't bother me. \nI stop. \nMy phone vibrates. \nI'm completely out of\
  \ breath."
