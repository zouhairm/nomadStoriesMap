Text: "New York feels like the hammering of rock on crystalline steel. It is rumoured\
  \ that Manhattan lies on a bed of quartz, a ticking timepiece acting as the church\
  \ where all come and worship. Time, here, is king and money is queen; and I am,\
  \ in the middle of this mess feeling a renewed sense of strength and purpose. What\
  \ for? I do not know, and perhaps no one else does. \n\nTrue cynics and snobs would\
  \ look at people who visit New York to see the Empire State Building, or the Statue\
  \ of Liberty, as simpler lifeforms. I look at them, giddily snapping selfies, some\
  \ genuinely happy, some with a false glare in their eyes hiding their true nature.\
  \ I know this glare because it reflects my own, stained with boredom so acute that\
  \ it becomes a disease, even an identity. Those daredevils, who cannot be satiated\
  \ with the norm, want to be exposed to something deeper, in fact, they have to in\
  \ order to truly experience life. \n\nI realised this on my first trip to New York\
  \ as I was naively following a group, like cattle hurdled from sight to sight in\
  \ a way I found positively monotonous. I realised that a connection beyond the realms\
  \ of the physical was needed for me to feed strength where the repetitive and tedious\
  \ routines had taken my lifeblood. I needed to do better next time.\n\nI arrived\
  \ at Port Authority Station at 2 AM. This time, the station was brimming with people,\
  \ roaming to the ticking clock, awake but somehow wrapped in hazy visions of some\
  \ type of hell. Police, like laser-eyed vultures, were waking people who\u2019d\
  \ fallen asleep on the station\u2019s wiry benches. The War on Homelessness left\
  \ many people no peace but this wasn\u2019t the time to be empathic, it was the\
  \ time to forget and walk on.\n \nIn this city of masks and illusion, people look\
  \ wealthy in debt, they pretend to be alive when their inner-life dwindles and fades.\
  \ From Manhattan to Queens, I met people in bars, in museums and in the streets\
  \ who all have shown me a different facet of the light of this dream. Seeing each\
  \ man and woman fighting to carve themselves a place in this world; suddenly my\
  \ cynicism was replaced with hope. I had found what I was looking for, or so I thought.\n\
  \nMy train was leaving from Penn Station, despite looking grand, it was designed\
  \ with a sinister end goal - like pikes to keep pigeons from nesting under bridges,\
  \ no human here could rest. I took my bags and walked to the restrooms, sat on the\
  \ floor, there was a girl, with notepad and pen, counting money. As I came out to\
  \ wash my hands, I could still hear the friction of the paper and numbers quietly\
  \ uttered. I was aware that it was unusual for people to count money in toilets\
  \ but who was I to judge? After all, were my own impulses anymore normal? I left\
  \ the room without giving this woman any second thought.  \n\nThree hours had passed\
  \ before I made another visit to the restroom. Still, I could hear the friction\
  \ of paper. I was startled as I  noticed her again. In a cold sweat, I started paying\
  \ attention to others. Was I the only one to know? No one seemed to think she needed\
  \ assistance? Then again, who was there to call? Police were here to protect against\
  \ men and guns; but who was here to offer care to people lost in time? No one. They\
  \ shoo them away like heretics, pigeons.\n\nNew York left blisters on my feet, but\
  \ also on my mind - perhaps this was the time for empathy, but I choose to put on\
  \ a mask and walk on. Had I been real, I wouldn\u2019t have been so afraid to let\
  \ the strength I had found here overflow, instead of hiding it all for myself. It\u2019\
  s easy to judge a careless city when we overlook that we are all parts of the whole.\
  \ For now, all I knew was that, again, I had allowed myself to live in fallacy.\
  \ I needed to be better next time."
