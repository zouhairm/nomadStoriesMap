Text: "My first full day in Maun was slowly drawing to an end with only one activity\
  \ left for the day; a boat ride down the scenic Thamalakane river. Maun, the tourism\
  \ capital of the safari capital of the world, Botswana, is a quaint village in the\
  \ west of the country, far from the busy east of the country with its cities and\
  \ towns and endless highways that connect them all. This is Botswana's 'Wild West'\
  \ with the sultry atmosphere carrying the scent of exotic plants and fresh dung\
  \ from the nearby grazing antelopes, dotted throughout the lush green plains that\
  \ blended into the amber afternoon sky in the horizon.\n\nOur camp was on the banks\
  \ of one of the meanders of the once mighty Thamalakane river, one of Botswana's\
  \ few perennial rivers which had reportedly shrunk in size due to recent droughts.\
  \ I walked out onto the dark soil that had once been the river bed to the small\
  \ boat awaiting me. It was docked on a ridge on the muddy bank and it jerked about\
  \ every time someone went aboard it, sending ripples through the calm, glistening\
  \ water. I stepped aboard, took a seat and braced myself for my first ever boat\
  \ cruise. The indistinct chatter of the other tourists on the boat was interrupted\
  \ by the immediate roar of the engine, and the boat slowly reversed away from the\
  \ bank.\n\nWe set forth down the river past various camp sights and chalets, a scenery\
  \ that sparked brief debates among others on the boat as to which camp looked better.\
  \ A light mist of water sprayed my face as we increased speed and ventured into\
  \ a wider channel. The camp sites gave way to open plains, and then to gigantic\
  \ palm trees that were packed so tightly together one could not see what lay behind\
  \ them. Occasionally, the boat operator would cut the engine to get enough silence\
  \ so he could enlighten us on what we were seeing. When a brood of black storks\
  \ glided a short distance away from us he opted to maintain speed so we traveled\
  \ parallel to the impressive birds long enough to truly appreciate them.\n\nThe\
  \ river narrowed again and I could see the top of reeds sway about beneath the clear\
  \ water. Among the reeds I saw flashes of silver as fish briefly swam up close to\
  \ the surface as if to tease my eyes and keep me gazing into the water. The operator\
  \ cut the engine and as we floated down the river he lamented on how the droughts\
  \ had greatly reduced the size of the river, speaking in a reminiscent manner, as\
  \ if he was speaking of an old friend lost to history. As he spoke a canoe drifted\
  \ past in the opposite direction with three young men on board who waved excitedly\
  \ as they passed. They uttered something but none of us could make out what it was.\n\
  \nIt was not too long before we found out what the canoe men had uttered. As we\
  \ turned at a meander that had formed a tiny sandy beach one tourist shouted 'Kubu!'\
  \ the local name for hippo. I craned my neck forward to see . The giant creature\
  \ lay ahead, much of its body under water with just its face above the surface looking\
  \ like a tree\u2019s bark. We watched in awe as it stared at us calmly, as if it\
  \ knew we were no match for it and thus would not bother it. I caught myself glancing\
  \ around our small aluminum boat to reassure myself that the hippo\u2019s enormous\
  \ mouth could not pierce through it. When I was reassured enough I proceeded to\
  \ take pictures like the other tourists had been doing. The darkening African skies\
  \ made it difficult to distinguish the hippo in the pictures, but as I watched its\
  \ ears flutter about above the water, I knew it was there.\n\nThis was my first\
  \ time in Botswana's 'Wild West' tourism capital, Maun, on a boat on its beloved\
  \ river. I did not know what to expect, but I was thoroughly overjoyed by what I\
  \ experienced."
