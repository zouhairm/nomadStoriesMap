Text: "In 2016 I took a cruise as part of a group of Women Veterans.  To keep it in\
  \ a central location for all, the Ship was departing from Galveston, Texas.  At\
  \ the time, I lived in Tampa, Florida.  So off I flew to Houston and joined the\
  \ group in Galveston for our adventure.  The first Port of Call was Key West.  Now\
  \ there's irony for you.  I lived in Florida, traveled to Texas to get on a Ship\
  \ that visited Florida.  Let me tell you, it was the talk of the group in terms\
  \ of such irony involved.  Thankfully, my Cabin mate had Friends meeting her in\
  \ Key West.  Such a grand time we had, with our own personal tour guides!  Without\
  \ question, we visited the Keno's shop so I could replace my worn-out Keno's sandals.\
  \  In Florida, it's one of the most common foot wear to be seen no matter where\
  \ in the State one lives.  To this day I'm still in contact with the Friends that\
  \ met us.  Now I've got people to visit when I visit Key West again!  From there,\
  \ we traveled to the Bahamas and visited Nassau on one day and Freeport on another.\
  \  Over all, it was a great cruise, not only due to the group of people I was with\
  \ but also due to the locations visited and general feeling of relaxation while\
  \ going on a cruise.  \n\nThis spring, it's back to the Caribbean for me with the\
  \ Veterans Group.  This time though, we'll visit Belize, Cozumel and Costa Maya.\
  \   I'm ready for another adventure!"
