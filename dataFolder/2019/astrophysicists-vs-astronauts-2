Text: "The night could have ended with this: \u201CWhen we arrived at the local pub,\
  \ we found out it was a darting competition, not a dancing competition\u201D, but\
  \ I wanted to be brave. Nevertheless, shooting arrows at a target seemed like a\
  \ good idea, so after hours of staring at people having fun, I approached one of\
  \ them. He didn\u2019t hit anywhere close to the center, but his determination and\
  \ bare feet were a close enough invitation for us to try out this modern form of\
  \ archery. I didn't think we would end up sleeping on his floor that night. The\
  \ events of the night suddenly became very elusive and things started happening:\
  \ he gave us some arrows, and when we failed miserably and kept shooting the wall\
  \ missing the dartboard by meters, he showed us how to stand and how to throw, and\
  \ there was a thrill to it. \u201CThink of the arrow as an extension to your body\u201D\
  , and I did. It was my first and only smooth hit for the night. A couple of \u201C\
  where are you from\u201D and a few drinks later, we sealed the deal and were invited\
  \ over. Entering the house felt like we had opened the door to an alternate universe.\
  \ The interior designer went for a mix between a pimp\u2019s lair and the scooby\
  \ doo\u2019s lounge: The kitchen had green and purple walls, the bathroom had a\
  \ Jacuzzi, rotten food in three mini fridges, empty bottles of liquor and a sense\
  \ of \u201Cwe\u2019re not in Kansas anymore\u201D. I hoped I hadn\u2019t made a\
  \ mistake. Under the harsh fluorescent light, we were three strangers trying to\
  \ find a feeling of home in the middle of Glenorchy in the middle of nowhere. Within\
  \ the towering mountains surrounding us, never ending sweetwater rivers, and green\
  \ scenery, we talked about why we decided to travel. They wanted to see the world,\
  \ to get away from home, to walk, to meet people. I couldn\u2019t fathom my exact\
  \ reason why. Hours of conversation later lead to his statement: \u201CNow don't\
  \ take this the wrong way but you\u201D, pointing at my friend\u201D, are an astrophysicists.\
  \ You are well read, like to to observe from a distance, and you\u201D, looking\
  \ at me, \u201Care an astronaut. You like to be in the heart of events.\u201D It\
  \ felt like he had punched me in my stomach. It was time to go to bed.\nLying on\
  \ the floor, I rolled around constantly trying to find peace, but I couldn't. I\
  \ kept thinking about his assessment of my character. How wrong was he: I\u2019\
  m a researcher, he should've seen how I planned this trip, how thoroughly well read\
  \ I am, hence I can use the word thorough in a sentence. The past couple of weeks\
  \ couldn\u2019t be silenced: the bruises on my legs, the cuts on my hands, the floors\
  \ I have slept on, the people who seemed to know who I was. I had to get out.\n\
  I went outside and looked up to the sky. It looked like my freckled face, spotted\
  \ with tiny dots of light. There were so many of them. It felt like a big velvety\
  \ blanket in which I wanted to cover myself with. I remembered why I wanted to travel\
  \ to New Zealand in the first place: going somewhere so far away from everything,\
  \ wild and purely untouched, discovering the beauty in roughness, the serenity of\
  \ being in the middle of nowhere. Looking at the stars, all of these places which\
  \ I may never visit, I didn't want to be an astronaut. I just wanted to be home."
