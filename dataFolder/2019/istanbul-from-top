Text: "My day started with a boat trip across the Bosporus, the idea of crossing two\
  \ continents in a few minutes fascinated me and intrigued me at the same time. As\
  \ we crossed the river, I laid my eyes on a medieval tower rising above the buildings.\
  \ The guy next to me told me that it was the Galata tower and has a panoramic view\
  \ of the city. When I got back on land, I was determined to go there and to check\
  \ the view from the top. I was walking in Istiklal street towards the tower\u2019\
  s direction, at least I thought so. It was very crowded as usual, I crossed small\
  \ alleys full of souvenir shops and caf\xE9s, yet all the street looked the same,\
  \ narrow and crowded. I don\u2019t even know how I slipped into the back alleys,\
  \ which were almost empty; I kept walking as if I knew my way. I finally reached\
  \ a small neighborhood full of colorful houses. It was not a touristy area for sure.\
  \ I saw old men sipping their Turkish coffees in the corner. I wanted to ask anyone\
  \ for directions, so I looked around waiting for someone. Suddenly an old lady stepped\
  \ out of her house and approached me. I couldn't understand a word of what she was\
  \ saying but it felt like she was trying to help me. She used gestures to communicate\
  \ with me and kept repeating the same words in Turkish only louder each time.  I\
  \ was smiling because I thought it was funny. she asked her granddaughter to come.\
  \ Her name was Zeynep, she greeted me with a smile, then told me that her granny\
  \ saw me standing outside from her window and she was sure that I was lost.\nFor\
  \ some reason, the old lady seemed very familiar, maybe because her kindness and\
  \ warmth reminded of my own grandmother, maybe that\u2019s why I felt home. She\
  \ insisted that I should stay for lunch and then Zeynep will show me the right way.\
  \ Grandma Afife was a very humorous lady.She noticed that I wasn\u2019t wearing\
  \ a ring so she asked me whether I had a husband or not. I shook my head no, so\
  \ she said \u2018it\u2019s better you are still young !!\u2019. I laughed because\
  \ I expected a completely different answer. She said that she feels happy because\
  \ women these days have far many choices in life than her generation. Even though\
  \ she loved her husband deeply, she wished that she has gone to school. She also\
  \ told me that when the time is right, she will take it upon herself to find me\
  \ a suitable husband among her grandsons.\n We spent the entire afternoon chatting,\
  \ we talked about our cultures, family, and life. She told me about her husband\
  \ who used to own a small bookshop nearby and that he died a few years ago. Ever\
  \ since then she has been quite lonely until Zeynep moved in with her to study in\
  \ Istanbul. It was almost sunset, so I told them goodbye and thanked them for their\
  \ hospitality. Zeynep showed me the way to Galata tower and said that it will take\
  \ me about thirty minutes by foot to get there. I kept walking as she said until\
  \ I was able to see the tower, as it kept getting bigger until I finally reached\
  \ it.  I immediately got on the rooftop to see the view. I stood on the small terrace\
  \ outside, 219 feet above the ground, my desire to see the city from above was stronger\
  \ than my fear of heights. I wasn\u2019t sure whether my racing heartbeats were\
  \ caused by fear, or excitement, or both. That night I saw one of the best sunsets\
  \ in my life, as the mosques and the bridge\u2019s lights reflected on the river\
  \ and added a whimsical touch to the city. However, the highlight of my day was\
  \ the afternoon that I\u2019ve spent with Mrs. Afife. That morning, I was searching\
  \ for the most fascinating view in the city, yet I ended up getting a better glimpse\
  \ of Istanbul after a delightful evening with a local."
