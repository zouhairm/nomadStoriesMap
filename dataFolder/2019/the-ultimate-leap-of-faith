Text: "By the time I realized my mistake, it was too late. There I was, my feet bound\
  \ together with bundled rubber bands, stationed on a 1 foot by 1 foot little metal\
  \ square ledge that extended out from the platform of \u201Cthe pod suspended by\
  \ high wires between two canyons\u201D swinging in the breeze. If I weren\u2019\
  t so petrified I would have noticed the picturesque river twisting its way around\
  \ the edges of the rocky walls that were directly beneath me.  \n\nI can feel the\
  \ presence of a crewmember directly behind me. He informs me this bungee jump is\
  \ the highest in the southern hemisphere at 134m like he was trying to impress me.\
  \ Impress me? At this point, I am terrified, contemplating life and what and who\
  \ had convinced me this would be a grand idea.  And why did I pick THE highest jump\
  \ for my first attempt? \n\nI am in Queenstown New Zealand. Embarkation point for\
  \ famous hikes like those along the Milford track, sightseeing flights to nearby\
  \ fjords, the gateway to epic skiing in the ranges and wild jet boating on the rivers.\
  \ Yet instead of having my feet firmly on the ground, I opted to take the high road,\
  \ literally.\n\nThe crew member with the unkempt messy ponytail tells me to look\
  \ up at the camera and smile. What camera? There are cameras\u2019 here? I try to\
  \ smile yet I\u2019m sure it was overshadowed by a tsunami of blind panic.\n\nWas\
  \ I making a huge mistake? Or was this going to be the proudest moment of my life\
  \ to date? My mind was playing tricks on me and I was yet to establish whether this\
  \ was good or bad. Physically I was prepared. I had always sought out adventure\
  \ and excitement, I liked to go fast, very fast. But I always have my feet planted\
  \ on the ground.  Now this was different. Very different.  \nMentally, I was not\
  \ prepared to tackle this challenge as I had initially thought, but it was too little\
  \ too late.\n\n5 minutes earlier, seated in the wobbly dentist chair and getting\
  \ kitted up, my thoughts had wandered to the brochure that clearly stated: \u201C\
  This jump was not for the faint-hearted\u201D. Easy. I was going to complete the\
  \ jump, get my photo taken, my certificate of completion and my souvenir T-shirt.\
  \ Mission accomplished.\n\nIt was one of those summer days that don\u2019t make\
  \ sense; the air was fresh and crisp for this time of the year. Was it because I\
  \ was so high up? I could have sworn we ascended up and above the clouds at one\
  \ point. Why did I agree to this madness? I get nervous when someone sits on the\
  \ edge of anything high. My palms are starting to sweat and my heartbeat is radiating\
  \ through my chest. My body stiffens up and my legs feel heavier all of a sudden.\
  \ I decided to avoid these body signals. I take in a deep breath of fresh mountain\
  \ air and enjoy taking in my surroundings.\n\n10.9.8\u2026 I get distracted by what\
  \ seems to be a countdown of my fall. Oh my god, this is happening.  A shot of adrenaline\
  \ pumps through my veins, as if I needed more. Unkempt ponytail tells me to focus\
  \ on the mountain ahead of me. Is this my last vision on this earth?\n\n7.6.5\u2026\
  \ I take a quick glance behind me to find an escape route. None. Damn. I notice\
  \ the next victim seated in the same wobbly chair as me previously. He looks like\
  \ I did 5 minutes earlier, so sure of himself. \u201CGo big or Go home\u201D is\
  \ the motto here. At this point, I would rather go home thanks.\n\n4.3.2.1\u2026\
  \ It\u2019s now or never. I bite my tongue and shut my eyes tight. Throwing open\
  \ my arms I take the leap of faith off the platform, diving head first. \nI can\
  \ feel the wind ripping through my hair. I open my eyes and the anxiety, the fear\
  \ and stress all just melt away as I am free falling into the gorge below me. The\
  \ feeling is surreal, I feel free and unrestrained. Wow. This is what freedom feels\
  \ like."
