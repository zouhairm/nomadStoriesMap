Text: "I just arrived to the island a pair of days ago. After having breakfast, I\
  \ packed everything and took the motorbike I had rented the day before. The main\
  \ road that crossed Flores island scaled through hills and dense forests. I couldn\u2019\
  t resist to stop at the side of the road and look back to Labuan Bajo from the heights.\
  \ The water and the little islands on the bay formed a beautiful picture.\nContinuing\
  \ my way up to visit the traditional villages from the Manggarai region, it started\
  \ to rain. I saw a warung, a small road kiosk, so I decided to stop there to have\
  \ some lunch and wait for the rain to stop. With my basic Indonesian and the owner\u2019\
  s basic English, I managed to have a delicious bakso, a traditional Indonesian soup\
  \ with vegetables and meat balls. I was enjoying my meal when a man arrived and\
  \ ordered another bakso. I said \u201Chello\u201D and he surprised me answering\
  \ in English. Teofilus -this was his name- told me that he had learned English on\
  \ his own. I had not had a full conversation in a while. I explained him that I\
  \ was traveling alone and I wanted to go to Wae-Rebo. My second surprise came when\
  \ he offered himself to guide me through the region and to show me the traditional\
  \ \u201Cspider-net\u201D rice fields.\nHe asked me to follow him with the motorbike,\
  \ so I did it. The rain had already stopped, but it was still cloudy and the air\
  \ was humid. When we arrived to a little village, he took me to another warung and\
  \ introduced me to his friends who were having a coffee there. I was invited to\
  \ join them. I had to tell them my story again, but even if they didn\u2019t speak\
  \ English very well, I could see they enjoyed having a foreigner guest. I liked\
  \ the way those people were welcoming me to their community. \nIt was already 5pm,\
  \ and I started wondering if I could arrive to Wae-Rebo that day. Probably Teofilus\
  \ noticed it, because he came with the third surprise of the day: he wanted to invite\
  \ me to have dinner and spend the night at his home. At first, I didn\u2019t know\
  \ what to say, but the friendly atmosphere convinced me to stay. So we said goodbye\
  \ and we went home.\nHis house was self built and very basic, as all the other ones\
  \ on the area. When we arrived, he introduced me to his wife and children. And shortly\
  \ after, other children from the village started to appear at the house. It looked\
  \ like they had spread the word of a foreigner in the village. At some point I took\
  \ my tablet and those kids were very happy to see it. They started to take pictures\
  \ and selfies, with me or just themselves, and filled my gallery with silly but\
  \ funny pictures. Then they connected the tablet to some speakers and put some of\
  \ my music. I think they liked it because they started to dance without control.\
  \ I spent most of the afternoon laughing with them.\nAt dinner time, we sat on the\
  \ floor and we ate some rice and chicken. Everything was served in a bowl in the\
  \ middle and we shared the meal using our hands. There is a technique to eat rice\
  \ with your hands that I had learned when I was in Malaysia two months before ,\
  \ so I could enjoy the meal without making a fool.\nFinally, we were ready to sleep.\
  \ Teofilus told me that I could sleep in  a corner of the living room using some\
  \ blankets they had as a mattress. In fact, they didn\u2019t have a mattress for\
  \ their own. I accommodated myself with my sleeping back and the children appeared\
  \ again. They also laid there with me to sleep together. That night, surrounded\
  \ by those cheering children, I was thinking about  how lucky I had been to find\
  \ Teofilus that day. But, in the next days on the island, I would learn that it\
  \ was anything but luck, as the rest of the people I met showed me the welcoming\
  \ and cozy nature of the people of Flores."
