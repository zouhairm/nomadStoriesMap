Text: "It happened in summer of 2016. I\u2019ve never been out of the country before.\
  \ I remembered like if it was yesterday when I got asked if I wanted to stay in\
  \ Colombia for a month for a retreat. It was part of the church that was organizing\
  \ the trip and four of us got chosen. I immediately took this amazing opportunity\
  \ because for once I\u2019ve always wanted to travel. Flight was really long but\
  \ I was happy and didn\u2019t regret it. The first place we visited was the capital\
  \ of Colombia, Bogota and its surrounded by beautiful museums and architecture.\
  \ It\u2019s recommended to go during the day. The next day I got send to a small\
  \ town called Cachipay, Cundimarca it was for hours long from another town called\
  \ Suesca. Cachipay was the town I was staying in for this retreat. Even though it\
  \ was small town I fell in love with the culture, music, and the people. Colombian\
  \ people are the sweetest and have so much to talk about. Everyone is friendly and\
  \ I recommend to visit it as a vacation. I learned so much from the culture the\
  \ whole month I stayed in. I made so many fiends from that country and I never felt\
  \ so happy. I felt connected to these people. After spending almost 21 days in Cachipay,\
  \ I went back to Suesca to rest for a day. Some other places I visited was Cerro\
  \ De Monserrate and it has a beautiful church to visit all the way on top of the\
  \ mountain. Beautiful view to see the whole city. I also ended up visiting a place\
  \ called Raquira and it was so beautiful like very vibrant. It was my favorite place\
  \ to visit. Many shopping can be done if you want something antique. I am sure there\
  \ so much to see in this beatiful country. Their dishes are the best. Mostly all\
  \ the restaurants have antique architectures. What this trip taught me is that being\
  \ outside in nature and walking through the city can help you find a real connection\
  \ with the country."
