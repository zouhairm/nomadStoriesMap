Text: "India was my first intrepid adventure.  Flying in from isolated New Zealand,\
  \ the first impression that hit me as we drove away from the airport in Kolkata\
  \ were the sheer number of people - individual lives - and pairs of eyes always\
  \ watching each other, and living on top of each other, in the most cramped and\
  \ creative situations.  The second that hit me was the distinctive smell, being\
  \ an organic mix of mustiness, incense, spice, cow poo, traffic fumes and flowers.\
  \  \n\nHowever, this story is about a particular and significant part of travelling\
  \ in India for Westerners that have anything like a tender stomach. In preparation,\
  \ my ex and I took the recommended vaccinations and tonics, our emergency medical\
  \ kit (including antibiotics) and truly believed we were set for the worst.  But.\
  \  Nothing prepares you for the kind of sickness that you get in developing countries.\
  \  \n\nThere is the notable stomach drop with shivers.  When suddenly.  Nothing\
  \ else matters.  But finding.  A bathroom.  As soon as humanly possible.  \n\nThis\
  \ is bad enough when you are in your home country, but at least there\u2019s local\
  \ knowledge, public bathrooms or home.  When you are travelling, the urgency becomes\
  \ unpredictable, blind panic.  Anything seems possible or desirable.   Sure - let\u2019\
  s go to that restaurant and order something so we can use their facilities.  Always\
  \ make sure they have a toilet first\u2026  toilet seats are a rare, definitely\
  \ optional, find.\n\nAlways make sure you take a ready supply of paper with you\
  \ at all times.  Both of us found to our detriment that you need to be sure of this\
  \ BEFORE you go.  And even have a second stash in case you drop the first on the\
  \ skummy floor water.  Otherwise you may, as my ex discovered, have to rely on the\
  \ local solution of a shared jug and bucket of water to wash away any nastiness\
  \ - which is the only option at the Taj Mahal in Agra.  \n\nRajasthan is where I\
  \ became the most sick on the trip, although it was a beautiful backdrop (no pun\
  \ intended!).  When you have a tight travel schedule you can\u2019t always change\
  \ plans.  Did I want to see Jodhpur - the ancient walled city in Thor Desert - yes\
  \ of course!  Then onwards, come what may.   \n\nBut to stop too much coming, I\
  \ tried immodium for the first time - preparing a plug for the long evening bus\
  \ trip.  What I did not anticipate was the amount of liquids and electrolytes that\
  \ I had consumed to replenish my body would also want to make a departure.  \n\n\
  So, we are on a bus in the middle of the night, a bumpy road, somewhere in the middle\
  \ of rural India when suddenly, I really, really need to pee.  Fine, I thought,\
  \ I can wait until we stop.  Sure.  I\u2019m ok with this.  It could certainly be\
  \ worse...  We rolled on, and on, with no end point in sight.  I turned to my ex\
  \ and confessed my predicament.  He asked, the completely unreasonable question\
  \ of whether I could hold\u2026 Wild eyes from me.  As the pressure increased, he\
  \ decided proactive action was necessary.\n\nBeing a big lad he walked up and banged\
  \ on the driver\u2019s door - the driver being safely behind a wall.  No response.\
  \  He banged again.  Silence.  With little patience and the urgency the situation\
  \ demanded (from my POV), he banged and kicked ferociously until a very calm Indian\
  \ man opened and spoke to him, reassuring that we would soon be making a stop. \
  \ \n\nTwenty minutes later, I was sprinting off the bus.  Like a feral cat.  I had\
  \ no idea where I was going, no bathroom was obvious, I went behind a building and\
  \ let out the waterfall.  The relief was immense.  And it\u2019s at moments like\
  \ this, immediately afterwards, that you have acute clarity.  I remember looking\
  \ up to the night sky, a full moon.  I remember thinking, the bus may go without\
  \ us but at least we\u2019ve had this pit-stop.  I remember, very distinctly, gaining\
  \ my night vision and realising that my panic and relief had been witnessed by both\
  \ dogs and cows - who were still watching with interest."
