Text: "Hi, \nI havent toured internationaly much. But ive travelled across India.\
  \ Mostly Himachal,Rajasthan & Uttrakhand. My think on my travel story is that our\
  \ birth to death is a tour on earth. We are all just sent by god to see beauty of\
  \ nature & respect it. Well it would be a great opportunity for me if I get this\
  \ ticket voucher to Portugal. \nThanking you. \nAbhishek Mehra"
