Text: I always wanted to Travel Abroad (Europe or America), but being a Pakistani
  passport holder its difficult to obtain visa and no time from work for holidays.
  Last year October 2018, I took my first trip to Germany for a Job interview for
  3 days. I was so happy to be there and like to visit Europe again. I visited Berlin,
  Munich in 2 days and visited cathedrals and TV station of Berlin. Due to shortage
  of time couldn't visit more places but like to take another opportunity.
