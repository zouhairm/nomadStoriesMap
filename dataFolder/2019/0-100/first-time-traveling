Text: I quit my study job and against all of  The negative responses of my family
  and friends I started to travel I want to new zealand  For  I'm the 1st out of my
  family to ever backpack anywhere and under 40%of Americans own passports . I tried
  so many new things for example bungee jumping sky diving think dolphins wimming  and
  whale watching go New Zealand . My time in New Zealand was one of the best time
  of my life.
