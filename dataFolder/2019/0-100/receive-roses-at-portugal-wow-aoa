Text: "Wanderlust! \n\nWhat I value the most when discovering a new travel destination?\n\
  The answers are: local food, culture, people, natural scenary, architecture, and\
  \ its uniqueness.\n\nI researched throughly and comprehensively before I hit the\
  \ road. Although my schedule is flexible. \n\nMore about myself:\nI am a hardcore\
  \ traveler, a detailed observer; I ampassionate and curious in nature.\n\nA digital\
  \ nomad majored in international media. The ability to produce multimedia contents\
  \ make me an excellent candidate. I worked as a journalist for more than 5 years.\
  \ I appreciate the conceise, vivid and intriguing way of delivering my travel stories."
