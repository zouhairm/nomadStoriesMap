Text: "The beautiful history of Portuguese culture has always drawn my attention to\
  \ visit the country. It\u2019s scenic beauty has always tempted me and there are\
  \ various rumours that I have known from my friends portraying that one must visit\
  \ the country. I would love to learn Portuguese and add another language to my list.\
  \ I hope to reach there as soon as possible so that I can explore the real Portugal\
  \ and show it to the World."
