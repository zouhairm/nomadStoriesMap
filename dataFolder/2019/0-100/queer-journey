Text: "I write Lgbtqi short stories. It's important to write about this theme because\
  \ of the representativeness issues. Lgbtqi people aren't properly represented in\
  \ the literature and in the arts in general. \nI intend to travel all over the country,\
  \ collecting various biographies of lgbtqi people. These bioggrafies will be a precious\
  \ source for my writting."
