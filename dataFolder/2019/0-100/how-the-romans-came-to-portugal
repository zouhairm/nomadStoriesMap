Text: I am a student at the University of Texas at Dallas, studying art and history.
  Next month I will make my first trip to Portugal to present my first academic paper
  and plan to visit several Roman sites like Coimbra and Braga, both have Roman ruins.  If
  I win it would be wonderful to return for second trip to dig into more detail about
  Roman architecture and bridges in what was Gaul.  This is a wonderful contest idea.
