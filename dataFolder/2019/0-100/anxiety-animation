Text: "I am from Chicago life hasn\u2019t been easy jumping into the world not knowing\
  \ where you\u2019re going to go is pretty scary, the unknown.  Learning and getting\
  \ to know other people and their challenges has expanded my view on life.  I\u2019\
  m excited to go beyond the wonders in the future and learn more about others and\
  \ pass my little \u201Canxiety;animation\u201C along.  Here\u2019s to the unknown\
  \ and the possibility."
