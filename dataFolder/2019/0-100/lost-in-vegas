Text: Me and my Dad decided to go to a local restaurant called Mama Mia pizzaria and
  had the most yummy pasta and 2 Mojitos each little did we know how much alcohol
  is in mojitos. So we left the restaurant and head to our hotel by foot 100% drunk
  little did I know how easy it is to get lost while your drunk. Long story short
  we ended up in a random playa and staying there until we got sober and ended up
  being 5 miles away from our hotel.
