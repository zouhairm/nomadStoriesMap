Text: After visiting Costa Rica for the first time and experiencing everything it
  had to offer, I fell in-love. I believe that it was clear that travel had became
  a passion of mine when white water rafting in Costa Rica. I had looked up and saw
  a family of howler monkeys, and in that moment I knew that there was more to life
  then living a normal, routine lifestyle. A 5-9 lifestyle, if you will. My mother
  now owns a condo there, and we try and go every year.
