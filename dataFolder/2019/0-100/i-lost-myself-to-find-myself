Text: Sometimes it's easy to find out what you actually want in life but sometimes
  what you got might make u realise that this is still not what you want in life.
  Travelling has different meanings for all of us, for some people its a break from
  their daily routine work like a stress buster, for some people its being by themselves,
  for some to explore and discover new places and new things, etc. For me travelling
  has always shown me a new side of me, this way I always get more closer to myself.
