Text: Queensland, far north Australia... Where you can inmerse in another World Just
  in a walk at night in the Middle of the jungle, while it is imposible see anything
  more than the moon, but you listen hundreds of little animals moving around with
  the leafs cratching... And after a warm sleep with peacefull breezes, wake up, open
  the Door and from the first step walk into the whitest sand and jump right to the
  torquise salt water to swim with ancient turtles...
