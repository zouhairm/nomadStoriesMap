Text: Went to Singapore about nine years ago on a holiday.Country is good ,clean  etc.
  One two  years back I found out that the girl I loved is based there now .I'm looking
  to find some good business or job opportunity to be there for a longish period of
  time.Even economy is strong of that country giving me another reason to go there.
