Text: Walking late at night or should I say early morning with a full moon at 2 am
  on the beach alone only with my husband we see a very large object coming up out
  of the water slowly about 300 lbs crawling up to the dunes. It was a looger head
  turtle who comes back to lay her eggs where she was born it was amazing site to
  see and a very much protected animal on this island but when shen was finished after
  4 hours she headed back to sea. Amazing birth of sea life
