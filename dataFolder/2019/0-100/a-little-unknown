Text: "Everybody thinks they know Mexico. They know about tacos, about tequila, sandy\
  \ sunny beaches and the monstrous city with a nice weather.\nBut there are so many\
  \ things that remain unknown. Like Michoac\xE1n and it\u2019s traditions around\
  \ the P\xE1tzcuaro lake. Ensenada and it\u2019s growing wine country, Merida and\
  \ it\u2019s colorful streets and its Nordic European influences.\nThere are many\
  \ things that you can find and love about Mexico, you just need to take a better\
  \ look."
