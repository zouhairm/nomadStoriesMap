Text: My name is Carolina and I'm Brazilian. I decided to leave my country and all
  my stability to venture into the land of my ancestors. I had never traveled to Europe
  and everything I know here has made it possible for me to lose myself in the streets,
  in the ways of Portugal. I see the places I visit through the tourist gaze, but
  trying to understand how to local, experience, participate, make of each corner,
  my place.
