Text: "Traveling is a bit tiring but for a surreal experience one has to keep themselves\
  \ push forward, similar thing happend while visiting the most underrated hill station\
  \ in Jammu, Patnitop has to be my most surreal experience ever it has such mesmerising\
  \ and breathtaking views to die for. \n\nFor a person who's never seen snow in their\
  \ entire life, this has to a paradise for people like them, before visiting the\
  \ place looked every other tourist spot but after visiting it the place is heaven,\
  \ right outta fantasy book almost thought I'm actually in Narnia."
