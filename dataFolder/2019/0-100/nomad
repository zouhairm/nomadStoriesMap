Text: "As much as I long to have you sing for me, to stroke your pretty feathers,\
  \ to keep you, the guilt of caging such a splendid creature would surely turn me\
  \ to stone. \n\nYou made my world bigger and I will see as much as i am able. I\
  \ will go looking for that same technicolour that you showed me, in every corner\
  \ of this world, because i know I will not find it, or you, here again. \n\nYou\
  \ will travel the world, looking for me in every girl you bed."
