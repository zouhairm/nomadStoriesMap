Text: Before the sun rose to greet the small village, you could hear the faint sounds
  of feet shuffling. Having traveled a long distance, I was unable to adjust my body
  and mind to the new dawn/dusk routine so I ventured to the open air  window for
  a looksee.  At first glance, it was difficult to figure the sound. Slowly his saffron
  clad robe pierced the edge of night and I witnessed for the first time the dedication
  of our villages spiritual elder begin the ritual.
