Text: "Unlike most Palestinian university students, I did not exchange in a foreign\
  \ country.\n\nI did not get a job because of the bad economic and social situation\
  \ in my country \n\nThe planet is such a \uFEFF\uFEFFbeautiful \uFEFF\uFEFFplace\
  \ and I believe we are all placed here to discover it.\uFEFF\uFEFF \uFEFF\uFEFF\
  To discover the beauty of nature and the beauty of different cultures."
