Text: i wish to know Portugal, cause I want to find and understand my roots. My grandfather
  was portuguese and as I was very little when he died, i would like to see where
  he was born try to figureout why he choosed Brazil to leave and have his family.
  It is really making a local connection . I believe I ll understand more about me
  and my parets and relatives
