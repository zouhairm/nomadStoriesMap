  \ things in storage and parked my car at my friend\u2018s place. I started with\
  \ a one way to Hawaii. I had no plan; couldn\u2018t answer people\u2018s questions\
  \ and just continued on.....Oahu, Maui and Big Island; I snorkeled with Manta Ray,\
  \ saw volcanoes and beautiful beaches! Then took a trip to Washington DC, from there\
  \ to mexico and now I am in chile.  I am not done yet!"
