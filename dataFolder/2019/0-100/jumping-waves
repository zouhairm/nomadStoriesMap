Text: Once I have learned how a open-minded attitude like traveling more than 1.000
  kilometers, only to see something new, can change lifes. After a lifetime strugguling
  with grief, the first time that I stepped on the sand of a beach I was 18 years
  old, was also my mom's first time, she was 58. It was a cold day, everyone was staring
  at me like I was crazy. A girl in a pink bikini in middle of winter, maybe 2 degrees,
  on a rainy day, jumping waves, I did not know exactly how to play on that new spot.
