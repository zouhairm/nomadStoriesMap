  \ seat but unfortunately i got the middle one, when i boarded the flight i asked\
  \ the neighbouring girl to switch places because i wanted window, and she did, then\
  \ we spoke i even shared my laptop with her and she let me sleep on her shoulder,\
  \ things got connected so beautifully well, after speaking for quite sometime she\
  \ just looked in my eye and bend front for a kiss, thats how before getting out\
  \ of the flight, i found my love in the air! \u2764\uFE0F"
