Text: "I lived in Brazil for a year and in that time most of my friends were obssesed\
  \ with the idea of moving to portugal later in life, and that made me wonder what\u2019\
  s behind that wish, what\u2019s behind that story. So i\u2019d like to get to the\
  \ bottom of it by going to Portugal and find out what is all about."
