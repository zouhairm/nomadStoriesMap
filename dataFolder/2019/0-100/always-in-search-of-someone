Text: 'Solo travelling seems fun until we watch other people travelling and posting
  feeds on social media but when we embark for the solo trip our expectations start
  haunting us. Our search for someone start as soon as we realise that it is not fun
  alone.


  From one person to another we see a companion to fill the empty space in our life.'
