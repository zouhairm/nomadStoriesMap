Text: By the end of last year I visited 5 countries of Europe among which I loved
  Italy the most .Now if we go to find why iwill end up writing an entire book.jokes
  apart,Italy just thrilled me.From the house of Romeo&Juliet in Verona to the gondolas
  of venice everything has a whole world within itself.The empty silent streets of
  pisa and the busy roads of milan told me so many unknown stories about how living
  there might feel.My trip ended under the Tuscan sunset while tasting wine of that
  region.italy iwill never forget you!
