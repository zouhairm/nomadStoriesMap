Text: "They say seeing is believing. But what about experiencing? Would that be considered\
  \ a revelation? \n\nExpectations are set high as I pack to travel to Portugal to\
  \ find revelations in food, people and cultures. I expect to find what I\u2019ve\
  \ seen through my screen, the many double taps of love for inages of bright colours\
  \ and vast landscapes. However, it is my time to leave the screen behind and experience\
  \ through my senses and allow the ink of my pen to lead the words of expression.\
  \ \n\nI hope these expressions accurately measure up to expectation."
