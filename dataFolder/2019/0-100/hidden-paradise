Text: I like to travel to unknown place so i didn't plan it before. First, i like
  to search from the villagers what interesting from that place. I came to lombok
  but most of people think that bali is the heaven of paradise of Indonesia but for
  me lombok is the truly paradise. You can imagine the fresh air, clear water, and
  so much fish. But, the most interesting about lombok is still clean and the tourism
  have not throw the trash.
