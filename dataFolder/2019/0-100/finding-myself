Text: My grandmother and grandfather gifted the trip to Ireland, Northern Ireland
  and Scotland for graduating college. While I have always wanted to travel to Europe,
  I felt I found myself in Europe. I had to think long and hard about my future. I
  decided on what I wanted and need to do for my future.
