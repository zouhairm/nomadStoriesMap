  29 years, I need this trip for know new people, new places for disconnect bad vibes
  and the problems, I need travel for find me,  find myself, without expectations,
  just enjoy the travel, learn a lot of another people, and make my dream to travel
  come true. I Just wanna be happy, breathing good vibes, good people, in the same
  way... Well this is my story, nothing incredible but, is a real story.
