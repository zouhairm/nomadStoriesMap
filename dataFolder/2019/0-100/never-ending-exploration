Text: "When I say \"never ending exploration\" It doesn't only about traveling and\
  \ exploring new places; but it's about living life with exploring and improving\
  \ every corner of ourselves,  knowing new people and their stories, learning new\
  \ everyday,  achieving interpersonal skills by constantly putting yourself in uncomfortable\
  \ situations.  \nCause learning is key for life."
