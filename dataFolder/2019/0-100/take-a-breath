Text: We find ourselves congested in our own worldly troubles, binding ourselves with
  the lost spirited beings- allowing all the inflicted false, unkind information,
  that both leaves you empty in the mind and in your soul, needing to be saved as
  every cost. Dependent to the world's emptiness.
