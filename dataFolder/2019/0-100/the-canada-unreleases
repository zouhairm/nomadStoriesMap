Text: My story was all started from india when i was all happy to move to canada and
  living a better easy life in all big cities, but i ended up living in small town
  in canada and tough and hard life, it was whole a opposite of what i thought of
  it before moving here , so my travel story was all about it and canada beauties
  and what to do what is better and not , and what it was like to me as a whole
