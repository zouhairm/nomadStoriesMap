Text: I am Adeleke Temitope, a Nigerian, I love writing poems. It is no more news  that
  my country Nigeria is facing so many challenges at the movement which range from
  corruption, bad leadership, insecurity and economic problem. How ever I feel like
  telling the world and my fellow Nigeria's the problem and solution by the means
  of a poem maybe my voice can be heard someday.
