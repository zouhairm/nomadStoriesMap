  \ very surprising \nHow people work , how they earn , how much they earn nothing\
  \ can be detectable . Lifestyle of mumbai is very different . In chals there was\
  \ a house of two storage but its only length is 12\xD712 they use whole house in\
  \ very systamic way. Every corner of house have in use. Mumbai city never sleep\
  \ as New York . Whole bar and casinos are open . Whole bollywood belongs to mumbai\
  \ . I have done lots of enjoyment there ."
