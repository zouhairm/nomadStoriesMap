Text: It was a chance to go visit my niece after not seeing her for 13 years, I went
  to see a teenager after knowing an infant years prior I was very nervous and had
  no idea how it will go because different environment and if she'll even remember
  me, we'd spoken on social media but never met in person since then so I wondered
  if it would work out as I'd always hoped and dreamed ever since the separation,
  fast track to the day and it was all perfect and beautiful
