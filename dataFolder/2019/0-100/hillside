Text: "Come with me,\nThere is a strange silence today.\nAre you awake? \nJoin me,\
  \ \nJoin me in my search. \nThere is something about the color green, elegant and\
  \ wild. \nSomething about the hillside, pleasant and cold. \nIt makes me think,\
  \ \nIt makes me wonder. \nJoin me on my ride. \nHide from those four walls, \nWalls\
  \ that you call your home. \nLet us sit on a hilltop instead and lose all sense\
  \ of time."
