Text: 'Travel in Indonesia you can explore about people, culture, food, daily life
  and they will welcome you with open hand and even they might treat you part of their
  family.


  You can join their culture and involved in their daily life. And you will forget
  about the news that always mentioned that travel to Indonesia is not saved.'
