Text: In 2014, I went to exchange in the Portuguese capital, I walked the streets
  as a local and I knew places like a tourist could not have done it, discovering
  wonderful places and learning incredible things, from the best experiences of life.I
  would love to come back and live this new experience, visit friends that I have
  not seen for years and continue discovering that beautiful place.
