Text: 'It was always my dream to travel around the world. I got the chance to do my
  post graduation in Canada. It''s such a beautiful country with beautiful places.
  I came here during the fall season and i fell I love with the beautiful nature and
  the colors of the trees changing. During the winter skiing, skating all these makes
  Canada a wonderful place. I wish to visit more countries and I hope I will one day.


  Thanks,

  Jithu'
