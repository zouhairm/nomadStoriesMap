Text: Having being born in Bucaramanga, a mid size city in Colombia but never having
  lived there, my intention is to document my past trough out the eyes of who I am
  now. I am a binational citizen (Colombian American) who is in progress to become
  an Spanish citizen via my Sefarfic connection to Monforte de Lemos. Following the
  Jewish paths in Spain all the way to Colombia.
