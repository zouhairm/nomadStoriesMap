Text: "Despite my claustrophobia I ascended the Esztergom Basilica; the largest church\
  \ in Hungary.\nEnclosed by ageing walls, I took each narrow step slowly.\nOnce I\u2019\
  d survived, the landscape met me warmly. Red-capped roofs jutted out of the tree-line.\
  \ Boats dotted the shimmering surface of the Danube. The only bridge in sight crossed\
  \ from Hungary to Slovakia. The neighbour melted into the horizon, conjoining fertile\
  \ hills with the misty skyline.\nMy outlook was bookend by two blue domes, topped\
  \ with crosses. I\u2019m not religious. But no Atheist could deny the beauty that\
  \ the Esztergom Basilica displays."
