Text: Hey Ravi here!! Well I am a very shy kind person but I like to observe people
  around me a lot. I see the the Nature in it's deepest depth. Recently I went to
  Chandigarh for a short trip of about 3 days. We once we were there on the platform,
  Everyone was confused about what the plan is. But everything got managed and I realized
  one thing that day that no matter how much things are complecated. Always smile
  and face it with truth and integrity.
