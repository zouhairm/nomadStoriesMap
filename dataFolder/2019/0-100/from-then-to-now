Text: "Coming from a densely populated country and travelling to a scarcely populated\
  \ one was indeed an unique experience in itself. The journey from the beaches to\
  \ the mountain terrain ,from the clear water lakes to the snow clad mountains ,from\
  \ fish and chips to pies, knowing the kiwis and being a part of their culture has\
  \ been so amazing so far. It is not about just the things you do ,it\u2019s about\
  \ the way you embrace the feeling when you travel around ."
