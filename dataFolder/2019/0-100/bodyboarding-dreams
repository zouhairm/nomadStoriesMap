Text: I just want the world. I got a chance too go to japan last year and stayed for
  85 days while being homeless there in japan. I had the chance too do what i wanted
  too do. I steped into kohei fukudas sunrise blvd sendagi and worked on numerous
  vehicles along side with my team mate yazu. Now i look forward too expanding my
  dreams and taking my skill too the next level with my bodyboarding skils and jumping
  into a big wave comp while there on visa. Hmu +18084928932 mahalo and aloha.
