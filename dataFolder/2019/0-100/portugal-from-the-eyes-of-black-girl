  \ I find that traveling is like a school of life, you learn a lot about a society,\
  \ culture and people by spending time in their space.\nEurope to me is a land full\
  \ of opportunities and loads of old time culture and history which intrigued me\
  \ and I would like to experience it all from the eyes of an Afrincan black lady!"
