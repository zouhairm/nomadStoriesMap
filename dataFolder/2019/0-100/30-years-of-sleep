Text: After 30 years of sleep, decades in fear and depression...a once in a lifetime
  adventure came up my mind... I have to go, to walk... to find myself again, my place,
  my purpose in this world... so I have to walk a looong way into the wild... to be
  pure, to be me... nothing else but me and nature in its wildest form... the pacific
  crest trail!!! My way back home
