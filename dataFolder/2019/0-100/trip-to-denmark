Text: 'I am writing here the story of my departure from Egypt to Denmark as a political
  refugee, and I do not speak well in any language other than Arabic .. And I have
  no money but barely enough for two days

  I tell you how my story began to dazzle and ended up adapting to European life and
  living in the European way of life .. This life I lived only through pictures of
  Denmark only

  In short, it is an attempt to get out of Egypt in any way .. even if only my imagination

  That''s why I wrote in Arabic'
