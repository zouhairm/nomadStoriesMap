Text: "The first time I went to Ireland, i was moved by the kindness of the people\
  \ and found the spirit i felt like I had been searching for my entire life. The\
  \ moment I stepped out onto the cliffs in the Buren in County Claire a feeling of\
  \ calm ran over me and I\u2019d like to share the places I found and the experiences\
  \ I had on my path to discovering an acient, yet everpresent, Ireland."
