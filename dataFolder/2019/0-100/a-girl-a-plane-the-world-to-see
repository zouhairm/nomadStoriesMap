Text: Packing my bags and taking the leap into the unknown begin in March 2018 in
  Thailand. Many beautiful sights, the culture and meeting the wonderful Thai's, I
  have many stories to tell. Starting in the South of Thailand, I will tell the story
  of a single girl, 20, who ends up finding the love of her life but also learns to
  love herself.
