Text: 'Every city gives you a unique travel experience. In this regard, I proclaim
  these experiences as puzzle pieces. In order one to be whole, one must consistently
  travel to collect his or her travel puzzle pieces from one city to another.


  This may seem like a never ending venture but then again humans are created with
  serious dexterity and complexity, and finding oneself as a whole is not easy.


  Travel does help to widen anyone''s perspective of life...so I wonder how many travel
  puzzle pieces will take to be a complete me.'
