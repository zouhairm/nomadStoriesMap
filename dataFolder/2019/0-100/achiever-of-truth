Text: "I'm a Graduat from good college.Every one thinks like a circle rotation like\
  \ studying, job and marriage getting kids is life. I'm totally confused and start\
  \ my journey to finding the truth and fallowing that path and find some answers\
  \ at the Great Himalaya from angora( lord Siva devotee's) now I'm also fallow them.\n\
  \   May be one fine day I achieve something"
