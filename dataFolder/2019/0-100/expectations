Text: 'When u land in a unknown place or in first time of your life u don''t know
  that what are yours expectations and what this country will be give to you. It''s
  all metter of time and living in it.

  So it''s my first time of life in Dubai Airport and I was surprised to look thousands
  races in one country. That''s the day when I felt that it''s a right saying that
  world is a global village.'
