Text: my grandmother house is in west bengal village side i often used to go to visit
  her place because that place somewhere connect me with its nature and natural beauty
  of landscape attracts me the most  there are tall plam trees  over which many colourful
  birds are flying then cattles are grazing and such such lovely weather with pure
  and fresh oxygen  and in nearby there are small ponds and mud houses which are more
  pleasent to see i just love travel over there again and again
