Text: My travel story will be about the street life and the culture of this country.
  As i am very passionate about street photography so i want to gain more knowledge
  about this theme and as i know in Germany  education cost is free. So i want to
  see how students take it seriously. Because if i am talking about india. We are
  less serious about free things.
