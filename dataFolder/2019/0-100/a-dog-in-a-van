Text: "From May 2018 I\u2019m travelling with my dog in a van. We spend our time on\
  \ the coast, because I love surfing and beach life. I work online translating to\
  \ Spanish and Catalan, and writing my blog www.enconversa.com about the special\
  \ people I met in surf, yoga, horses, lifestyle, health, travel, etc. and can share\
  \ their message with us.\nI travel as a single woman and I love to write about courageous\
  \ women that decide to leave the comfort zone and try something different in life."
