Text: "Last year i was with my friend at pune, tamhini ghat. I completely fell in\
  \ love with the place. The greenery of the trees, the sparkling water, it is a really\
  \ happy place.\n I always found myself alone on the road surrounded by endless beauty,\
  \ I felt like this was my chance to do something else I\u2019ve always wanted to\
  \ do."
