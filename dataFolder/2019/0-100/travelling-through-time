Text: I would love to explore the world where there is an ancient history to be discovered
  and learnt about. History is mysteriously beautiful and exploring them is like another
  mystery of your life in the planet. Getting to know the past and the beautiful artifacts
  that nature and our ancestors have left behind for us to know what they were like
  then is beautiful thing to looks into which brings people more closer to each other.
