Text: "After a 20 minutes ride, I left my bicycle along a wall of sun-lit stone and\
  \ began to walk. Spring in Japan bloomed like the cherry blossoms surrounding the\
  \ temple. I was the only foreign visitor in that suburban scene, where time flowed\
  \ backwards. Kyoto spoke through its colonnades of stones, the red embroidery of\
  \ the temple doors, the imposing \"t\u014Dri\" that amplified the sacredness of\
  \ the place. Like the painted ideograms, everything spoke of a secret meaning and\
  \ for the first time in my existence I felt connected to the deep plot of the universe."
