Text: "We always say that the opposite of cold is warm, and most of humans,are looking\
  \ for that warm place, that place where we feel  safe or protected.\nBut srating\
  \ at the cold mountain in Bariloche, Argentina, not only made me feel warm, but\
  \ it made me found something i didn\u2019t expect to, it made me found myself.\n\
  So now i know that when i\u2019m cold or i feel alone, i can stand and whatch that\
  \ imaginary mountain, and feel the warmth of being with myself."
