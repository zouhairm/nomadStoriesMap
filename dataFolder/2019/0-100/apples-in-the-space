Text: The story takes place in deep space. Two astronauts, completely alone in a huge
  spaceship, head for Mars, a colonized planet. The clashes caused by the age difference
  between the two and the speculations about the future of the human species will
  often distract them from the work for which they are there. In fact, they are transporting
  the Mona Lisa and other important masterpieces to Mars.
