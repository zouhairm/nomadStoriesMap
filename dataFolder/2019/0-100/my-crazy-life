Text: "I\u2019m very surprised about English people,cos since my 7 years of travel\
  \ I heard some bad reputation about them but they showed me it was wrong,people\
  \ there is lovely (some of them are Wild )I can't admit the opposite , when I was\
  \ there they helped me a lot with my situation, which it wasn't good at all, and\
  \ I made so many friends, I was doing volunteer for homeless people with some of\
  \ them and they introduced me to the culture and trust me, even though they didn't\
  \ know me.soni will be always grateful for that country and their people!"
