Text: "I traveled to Merida Yucatan due to its maya history, and i have to say that\
  \ is the best city in Mexico to live in. Inmediatelly you arrive to Yucatan you\
  \ feel an amazing vibe. The streets, buildings, food, natural pools called cenotes,\
  \ and visit the archeological centers are some of the greatest things of yucatan.\
  \ \nMy favorite part of Yucatan was visit Chichen Itza, because im mexican and see\
  \ all the beauty and the history made feel prouder than i was. Definitelly i\u2019\
  d visit again."
