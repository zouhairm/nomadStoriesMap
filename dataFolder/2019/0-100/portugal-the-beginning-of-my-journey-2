Text: "I am a writer with many talents, in search of inspiration. I never dreamt I\u2019\
  d be in Portugal to start my journey,nor a writer about it either. I always wanted\
  \ to travel and to my surprise, I\u2019ve explored Portugal and it has been an eye\
  \ opener. The food, the people, the architecture, and the culture, has left an impression\
  \ on me and how beautiful a place could be with so many unknown wonders."
