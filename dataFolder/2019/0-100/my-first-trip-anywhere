Text: I have no travel story. Lol. But I want to have one! I would go anywhere in
  the world. I have only been two provinces different from the one I live in, Alberta.
  Saskatchewan and BC. Which can be beautiful each in their own way but I want to
  go somewhere farther away. Somewhere warm with white sand and trees that have fruit.
