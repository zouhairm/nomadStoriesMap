Text: Your 20s are when you're an adult figuring out who you are and at 25 you finally
  have a fully developed brain. The amount of autonomous power gained during this
  period of personal development along with technology is anathema to our ideals as
  a child so we either approach this "career" with optimistic grandeur or negative
  pessimism that says everyone's doing it aleady and doing it better.
