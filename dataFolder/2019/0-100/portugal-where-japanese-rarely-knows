Text: Since there are no direct flights, not so many Japanese people visit Portugal.
  However, this country is similar to Japan. There are a lot of islands close to the
  mainland and foods are acceptable for Japanese. I would love to focus on especially
  islands such as Azores and Madeira islands. In 2019, Japanese people focus on remote
  islands so this is the best timing to focus on those islands as well.
