Text: "I love travel in India because \u2026 Only in India I get to see physical evidence\
  \ that God is omnipresent and in every form; be it a stone, a tree, a cow, a person\
  \ possessed by spirits, the small shrine in the middle of crossroads or even autorickshaw\
  \ meter bcaz we cant see by naked eye god but you can see by heart ."
