Text: "This is an adventure experience that could be coupled with several other activities\
  \ \u2013 ski Norway, chase the Northern Lights, snowmobile across a frozen lake\
  \ \u2013 there\u2019s enough adventure in Norway to last a lifetime. The most exhilarating\
  \ activity in the arctic circle though, is definitely dog sledding. Not only do\
  \ you fly behind some of the happiest dogs you\u2019ll ever meet, but you\u2019\
  re sure to get a good workout in too. Even first timers get a chance to drive, don\u2019\
  t miss this adventure."
