Text: "I don\u2019t want to write lengthy travel story but instead I want to hit exactly\
  \ at the point by my writing the real purpose.\nSo some people travel for fun, some\
  \ for other purpose but honestly I want to go somewhere far to explore myself. I\
  \ don\u2019t want to brag anything fake by writing catchy sentences but I want to\
  \ mention the real purpose and that is self exploration. Being an introvert I guess\
  \ it\u2019ll be a great chance to explore myself better. \nThanks for your precious\
  \ time.\nRegards"
