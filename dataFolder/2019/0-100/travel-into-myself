Text: "Mine story is my first time on an trip also mine first time alone was to Lisbon.\
  \ \nAn journey that make me see how strong I can be after an long illness an journey\
  \ that make me see beautiful people and simply enjoy the view. \nToday I still remember\
  \ everything like yesterday, sometimes to be present means also to be alone .\n\
  The reality of mine trip was an fantastic time spend in every second like is an\
  \ eternal."
