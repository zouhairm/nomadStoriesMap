Text: 'On our bus-ride from Luang Prabang to Vientiane, Laos a truck blocked the entire
  road and no vehicles could go through. We were all stuck there in the highest mountaintop
  and the driver told all the passengers that we could be stranded there for days.


  People began to camp out, but we had a train to catch back to Thailand, so we walked
  down the mountain to the other side for hours until a kind tuk-tuk driver delivering
  groceries to small villages rescued us. Thanks to this experience we got to see
  the most majestic landscape of Laos!'
