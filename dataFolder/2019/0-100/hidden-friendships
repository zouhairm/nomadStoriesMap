Text: "I would love to travel to Portugal to get a feeling for this. The basis of\
  \ this story is this: many friendships are made every single day. We find friends\
  \ in unexpected places. Sometimes their close, sometimes their far away. No matter\
  \ where we come from, we all have a story. Let\u2019s travel the world in search\
  \ for those hidden stories"
