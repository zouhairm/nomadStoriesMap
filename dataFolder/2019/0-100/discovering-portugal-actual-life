Text: 'Every time I''m excited to visit new place. Their food, culture, their history,
  languages,dress code, old structures bring gossebumbs to me as I become more familiar
  to them. Sometimes I think why don''t I bought up here only. Not the external beauty
  that every tourist visited I always try to visit thier current civilization, small
  roads, street food, social set up. I wish I could travel whole world and can know
  each and every thing.
