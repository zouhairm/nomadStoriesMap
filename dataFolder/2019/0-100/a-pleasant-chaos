Text: Noise, motorbikes, same faces everywhere, unknown language conform the perfect
  atmosphere to feel an alien. But sometimes that chaos can become confortable, even
  soothing, when your inside stops for contemplation. In a country where I would always
  be a stranger I felt rooted, connected to the flow of people passing by, the fog,
  the lack of eye contact. Another kind of quietness invaded me and connected with
  every inch of my soul. This is a story of connecting with the other, the far self.
