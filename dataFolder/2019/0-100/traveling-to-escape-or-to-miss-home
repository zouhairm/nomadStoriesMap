Text: My travel story will be about learning and self growth. A journal about seeing
  different cultures. Experiencing a new environment. Trying new food or maybe learn
  a different language. Exploring always make me realize how blessed I am. I want
  to write a story to promote traveling and share my story on how traveling made me
  a better, calmer self.
