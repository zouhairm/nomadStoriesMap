Text: As a child I was always curious about different countries and cultures. As I
  grew I traveled over the world and collected my memories in a little book called
  travel stories. I will be glad to share my last experience and uncover the uncovered
  stories. My goal to bring awareness and happiness so we can build peace. My career
  goal is to write a book about my travels and different peoooe of the world.
