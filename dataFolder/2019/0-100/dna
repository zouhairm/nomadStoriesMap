Text: 'definitely Portugal has it all.

  spaces, flavors, beaches, mountains, Tejo sunset...

  but the most exciting thing is its people.

  people born in all parts of the world generate incredible connections there.

  some chacra of the earth is open in that land

  there is a magic that makes each corner an astral journey.'
