Text: "I went to Greenland with my friend and her husband. \nThey are professional\
  \ photograhers.  \nThey have very expensive camera sets but I have just an iPhone.\
  \ \nThey taught me how to see things through the lens.\nSometimes my shots are too\
  \ good and pictures are better, as they agreed.\nI hiked so many hours every day.\
  \ So much fun!!!\nI did not expect to see the aurora but I did. \nI did not expect\
  \ to have new friends but I did.\nI did eat whale and saw gigantic icebergs. \n\
  I will definitely go back there again. \nThe unknown excites me."
