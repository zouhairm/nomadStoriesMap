Text: Portugal is a country that is considered to love sadness. I want to write how
  sad, what things are sadness and why it happened. I gave the title "other side of
  the world", because everyone in the world wants happiness, but it turns out there
  is an exsotic country that loves sadness. I hope I get the opportunity to meet great
  people and can write well. I have never been involved in writing an article before,
  because many people underestimate me. And now I will prove that my writing is valuable.
  Thank You
