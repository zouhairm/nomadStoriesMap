Text: 'It was when i met her for the first time in Paris. She was dressed appropriately
  and as i looked into her eye while having breakfast i got to know that she is the
  one. All the next moments i spent with her just added up to building a great relationship.

  This photo was taking in one of the cafe''s while having dinner and the idea just
  came to my mind to picture her this way.


  Am not a professional photographer but i love taking photos.'
