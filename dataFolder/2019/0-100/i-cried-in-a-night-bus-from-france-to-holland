Text: So i spend only a week in France, i went to most of museums, Nottredame of course,
  Eiffel for sure, Musee du Louvre where Monalisa painting stand there and people
  queued just to take a selfie with it. A week to discover French is actually not
  enough, thats why i cried when i end my journey in a night bus to Holland. Every
  single place is just so beatiful, seems like worth to be tourism spot. The cafe,
  the food, the culture and language!
