Text: I went to Korea for study abroad for 5 months since February 2017-July 2017.
  It was really fun and memorable because I can study and also travel at Korea, celebrate
  my birthday with the lovely peoples, making new friends from overseas, take a lot
  of great photos, try the food, beverage and learn new language. Because of the experiences
  I can learn to be more independent. I hope I can go to Europe to explore it. Yeay!!
