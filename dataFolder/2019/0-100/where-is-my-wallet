Text: "One time I went to Portugal and my wallet got stolen. \n\nAfter calling my\
  \ travel insurance company told me I needed a police report I went to find the station.There\
  \ was a really nice man who helped me find it.\n\nI went there and asked the policeman\
  \ where my wallet was. \n\nHe said he didn't know.\n\nI went home and I realised\
  \ I had just left it in my bag."
