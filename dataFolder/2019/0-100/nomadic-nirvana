Text: "African music has made its way into all forms of genres and I want to trace\
  \ its existence both present and past. What meaning was carried then and has transcended\
  \ now. We\u2019ll create a visual timeline that captures present culture as a way\
  \ to exist in the books of history. Music is just another form of life\u2019s expression\
  \ and I\u2019ll look at the spaces this expression exists in to fuel a riveting\
  \ discussion about the importance of music in our lives."
