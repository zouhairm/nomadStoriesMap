Text: "Going back to Croatia the land of my mother and living with her family in Split\
  \ Dalmatia where I found my heart and soul in the land of everlasting dreams from\
  \ the heavenly sun rises to the colorful sunsets to the crystal pearls of the Adriatic\
  \ Sea to the singing of folk Dalmatian songs by the bonfires on the beach, it\u2019\
  s like truly living in heaven on earth !!"
