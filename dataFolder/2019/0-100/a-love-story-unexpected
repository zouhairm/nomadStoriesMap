Text: I went to Lisboa last year and I met the sweetest boy in the world! He is from
  Lisboa and we fell in love, we talk everyday and do FaceTime and I haven't seen
  him for more than a year and I would really love to see him again. I didn't expect
  to find such an amazing boy, I really love him! We have been in a relationship for
  7 months and I would really enjoy to learn the language of my love in his country.
