Text: "I always knew that if I would like to be a good, excelent writer, I must jump\
  \ into life. I\xB4m from Argentina, from a very traditional city, born in a very\
  \ traditional family. So, when I first announced that I was leaving to the southest\
  \ part of the continent, they didn\xB4t understanted why... How could I explain\
  \ to the that I was thirsty for adventures, that I, as a writer, was in the need\
  \ of expearence to fill my white pages?! Off I went to Punta Arenas, to the end\
  \ of the world, and there it starts my story."
