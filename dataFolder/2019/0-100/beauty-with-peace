Text: Whenever you go for a travel first thing which attracts you is the sounds of
  thousands people who are walking on road . When you see those happy faces ,it makes
  you feel happy no matter what whether you know them or not . These small things
  inspire you to write those experience in the form of stories that can connect with
  others who are not present.
