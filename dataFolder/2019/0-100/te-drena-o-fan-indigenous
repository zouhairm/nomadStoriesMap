Text: When I was a child, I never throught about fulfilling a dream. Coming a indigenous
  population, rooted to my parents and with few economic resources, one day I decided
  to fly and left my community to become a student of economy. My biggest dream is
  to know Portugal, live the experience and get all the necessary knowledge to be
  motivaring other young indigenous and demostrate that all dreams can become reality.
