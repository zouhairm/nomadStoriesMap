Text: New place teach me new things, finding secrets of every place. Mother nature
  has deep emotions which gives me goosebumps and nature is the biggest scientist,
  all we need to do is understand the depth of the nature and the place you are travel
  I love you my mother. There is no words to explain about my emotions if it is then
  no book or pages left.
