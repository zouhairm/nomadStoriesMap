  \ make new memories. I arrived the 13 th of August and then what I was expecting\
  \ was not what appended. I didn\u2019t speak any English so I could understand anything\
  \ but after a while I learn this new language and I made new friend during classes\
  \ ... i left the 21th of June. It was so sad, during this year I learned a lot i\
  \ have a new family"
