Text: Visit one of my favorite countries (I am a Syrian married to a Portuguese),
  and try to find cultural similarities and cross cultural proverbs and idioms and
  customs and to use my investigation in a story book for children to adapt to their
  future in foreign European and other countries after immigration and enduring post
  war traumas. Obrigada!
