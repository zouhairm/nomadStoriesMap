Text: I travelled to goa the place where my soul reside... Goa is a soulfull city
  where you can discover yourself while cheerishing the fun of sun, sand, adventure..  motor
  boat ride on the beach , fish catching, local sightseeing gives you the perfect
  adventurous feel.. The night life is all you desire in dream.. it was just like
  a fantasy night on a solo trip.. The shots of vodka along with the mouthwatering
  fish fry cooked on the beach side satisfied the hungry tummy..  Small walk at the
  beach side after having tummy full diet refreshed the mind...
