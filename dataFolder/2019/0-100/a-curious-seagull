Text: I am a travel agent and tourist guide. I would like to tell you about the trip
  through Portugal from the perspective of a seagull. This seagull is whatching at
  people during their trip around the country (what they do, where they go, how local
  people behave...). Telling everything there is to know about Portugal, as well as
  curious facts and recommending places that are not so well known and are more frequented
  by locals.
