Text: "The fun of being in Portugal starts from the packing of the bags in Brazil,\
  \ yes it is incredible to be able to travel to the unknown!\n\nUnknown that reveals\
  \ the most incredible experiences that should be shown in series. Series of my embarrassments\
  \ with the equivovos in language, series of foods to try, series of walks, and not\
  \ least the unfamiliar knowing series. Especially the latter brings me an incredible\
  \ challenge: making spontaneous friendships with people I've never seen before,\
  \ will it roll ?! \n\nCome and enjoy this adventure with me! :)"
