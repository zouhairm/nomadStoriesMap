Text: "I love traveling so much that if I was well off I would travel every month.\
  \ I\u2019ve been to couple countries and enjoyed meeting the locals and trying local\
  \ food. I enjoy travel because it gives me a peace of mind and relaxation. Last\
  \ year I won a trip to Bahamas for my birthday it was the best vacation I\u2019\
  ve ever had in my life, being on a cruise fur the first time and sailing to Bahamas\
  \ with great entertainment and delicious food bad drinks was all I needed during\
  \ my birthday."
