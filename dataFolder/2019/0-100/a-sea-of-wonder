Text: We were about to board the massive cruiseliner and I struggled to take it all
  in. The smell of the crisp sea air, the raucous laughter of an aged leather bikini
  clad woman, and of course the MSC Sinfonia in all its glory. Little did we know
  that once we boarded the ship, we would leave the ship slightly  changed for the
  better.
