Text: I want to travel the world. Its that simple. I have always wondered why do we
  work to go on vacation when we should be paid to go see the world. Maybe this world
  would a better place if we had that worldly knowledge and cultural sensitivity.
  Otherwise people are subject to a mundane and otherwise ignorant lifestyle.
