Text: The history of my people can be explained through the groundwork of Portugal,
  as they came to the islands of Cape Verde and colonized the land. My history and
  lineage can be found through the intertwining and mix of two cultures that ultimately
  formed an entirely new ethnicity today. I guess I want to know my ancestors and
  record the process of discovering myself throughout the journey of understanding
  Portugal's history and efforts to create growth on the Cape Verde Islands.
