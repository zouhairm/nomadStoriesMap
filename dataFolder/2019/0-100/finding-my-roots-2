Text: Over fifty years ago, a woman boarded a ship with her three children. The destination;
  Canada. She knew no English, and had no relatives or friends across the treacherous
  terrain except for her husband who had left previously to start their knew life.
  Now, her grandchild, years later, ventures back to her homeland to find a missing
  part of her.
