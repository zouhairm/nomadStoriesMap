Text: Travelling for me it is not only mean to move our body to the other places.
  But it means to find something, to explore and discover. I'm indonesian, and people
  who heard me went to Thailand to travel often said "why did you go to Thailand?
  It is just simillar to Indonesia." No, I said. There are lot of cool things I found
  there. It is surely the unknown things that we did not know before. And it is finally
  able revealed when we finally truly do the travel, by ourselves.
