Text: 21 years old and I already want too experience more than the 9-5 and weekend
  bar life. Realizing that I have the power to change my life for the better is curving
  my path towards bigger experiences. I want too buildmy legacy on authenticity, passion,
  and something that money can't buy. Happiness and a feeling of oneness. I want too
  see beautiful scenery and make connections of a lifetime. This world is full of
  brilliant opportunities and I've decided that I won't miss out.
