Text: My dream is to travel to Spain. Travel the Santiago path.  Dance in the streets.   Feel
  the fire of a culture that makes my heart sing. Travel to Valencia see the beaches
  and meet the students that I feel in love with while teaching ESL in NYC. I am a
  passionate artist and a yoga teacher. My grand mother taught me Spanish. It has
  been a dream to travel all over and let the country renew my soul.  I feel a power
  and a bright hope in this country. Maybe one day my dream will be reached.
