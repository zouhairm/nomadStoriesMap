Text: Lige on the road is as eventful as it can be, everyone has a story to share,
  Same goes for me. All the haults we had at the end of the day presented some beautiful
  stories to tell, the moment lit up. My travel and adventure inspiration is my dear
  teacher Dr. Basumatary, Everest climber himself, I was fortunate to go on trekking
  trips , we the group of 5 call ourselves the "PANDAV", much like the mythology.
