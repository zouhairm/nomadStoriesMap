Text: "On my flight to Chile - Santiago I knew a very kind person from Santiago, her\
  \ name is Haydee. I didn\u2019t have a Airbnb o Hostal to go to. She invited me\
  \ to stay in their house. Cooked me topical food from Chile and she treated me like\
  \ her daughter. She was already 60 and I am 26. She\u2019s showed me the best sides\
  \ of chile and the very warm culture! It was a pleasure to met Haydee in the flight!"
