Text: I didn't just travel, I explored...I felt the poised hills, the bold mountains,
  the dignified trees, the relentless waterfalls, the intelligent tea gardens, the
  deep forests, the hospitable roads, the humble tunnels, the philanthropic bridges,
  the musical streams, the adventurous river, the simple grassy ground, the peaceful
  monastries, the angelic snowfall, the pristine snow, the classy gardens, the dreamy
  fog, the playful rain, the brave hamlets, the fairy citylights, the kind bonfire
  and the nomadic clouds. All of them gifted me positivity. And of course, beautiful
  memories tagged with their valuable advice on how to live life more meaningfully.
