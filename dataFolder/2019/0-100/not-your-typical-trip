Text: I spent 2 months riding a motorcycle alone across Vietnam, from saigon to hanoi.
  I had no internet, or cell phone service. I don't speak vietnamese, and only used
  an old fashioned map and a compass. I'm now thoroughly convinced communication is
  deeper than words and language. Keep it simple
