Text: In 2007 I bought a tour package to meet Machu Picchu. I did not expect to go
  through so many unforeseen events. I went by bus from Brazil to Machu Picchu. It
  was a 22 day trip to get there. I passed through Bolivia. In Bolivia I went through
  several demonstrations around the country that stopped the roads. I went through
  a landslide and very badly with the attitude. this trip changed my life for the
  better, because I learned to become alone and started traveling alone.
