Text: I want to travel to the Netherlands and discover the ecosystem of environment
  and wildlife and how to use modern technology to protect wildlife. And also how
  to preserve the environment. Using a remote protection system such as optical fiber,
  magnetic resonance and heat vesistance. So we can keep extinct objects and ecosystem
  healthy away from thermal emissions.
