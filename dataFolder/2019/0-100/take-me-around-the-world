Text: "As a South African I would love to see the world and all its curiosities. I\
  \ already live in such a magically beautiful country, why not see what the rest\
  \ of the world holds. \n\nA passion for the world inside and outside the borders\
  \ of my country.\n\nBorders are made to be crossed, and lives are meant to be lived.\n\
  \nIt would be unfair to live a life confined to one country when you can experience\
  \ even more cultures"
