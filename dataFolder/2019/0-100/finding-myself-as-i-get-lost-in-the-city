Text: "As we leave the known all we really have is the unknown, an uncomfortable space\
  \ for most but the only place where real magic begins & continues....\nThe hardest\
  \ thing in life is to know who we are and what we came here to do \nThis travel\
  \ story will be a one woman journey into the realms of the uncertain, the unplanned\
  \ and how through experiences, encounters, sightseeings and reflections she goes\
  \ into who she really is and inspires others to do the same\nAs the tree grows deeper\
  \ into the roots , there is no wind that can shake it."
