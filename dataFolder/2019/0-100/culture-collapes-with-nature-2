Text: Well recently I travelled to JAISALMER city in Rajasthan , it has an beautiful
  architecture,Culture..etc . I was surprised that India contains lots of language
  & Cultures . Even though it's an democratic country but people's are Insisting of
  making their own language and culture has official or national . But really one
  thing about India is that ... no other country has more languages than India . But
  u know something this makes a difference of all people .
