Text: I love to travel and learn about new cultures, meet new people and see new things.
  I have travelled to many places but feel my journey is only beginning in recent
  years. I would love the opportunity to win this scholarship to travel...it would
  be a dream. I have never been to Portugal and to write and experience it would be
  a new perspective.
