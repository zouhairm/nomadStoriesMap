Text: "I went through a separation 2 years ago and that has inspired me to travel\
  \ the world. I have 1 baby boy and this time round we went to Canada, England and\
  \ Wales. We are planning to travel every year as that is what they have enjoyed\
  \ to. Meeting new people and culture and understanding the world is larger than\
  \ our house and city.\nIt\u2019s a great experience, I\u2019ve loved to travel and\
  \ I feel I have the freedom to do so now"
