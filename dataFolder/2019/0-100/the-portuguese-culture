Text: I'd like to learn about the portuguese culture and find information about the
  gastronomy, music and feelings of the people and my ancestors, because they came
  from Portugal. My surname is Ferreira, and I want to find my conection with that
  wonderful country and understand why a lot of people left that land centuries ago.
  Nice to meet you!
