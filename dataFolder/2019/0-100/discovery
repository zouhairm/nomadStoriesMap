Text: "This was the best travel ever until now ! I'm so lucky to have a chance to\
  \ discover this amazing country. \nI spent 20 days there without being bored, i\
  \ visited almost all cities as it a very small country. The most important thing\
  \ which made me so interested is its story, the war's story, the story of lebanese\
  \ who live always on fear, the fear of losing their home. It was the sadest part\
  \ on the trip but it shows me that people can create happiness inside a sad world."
