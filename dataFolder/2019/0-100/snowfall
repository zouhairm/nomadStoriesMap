Text: After her mother's unexpected death, 20 year old Jessie travels with a group
  of friends from sunny Florida to Germany's Black Forest to discover her roots and
  a family home she never knew existed. Amid ski trips and drinks at the local pub,
  questions about her family's mysterious past continue to rise. She is warned not
  to dig further, but she has a need to know the truth. What she finds might tear
  apart everything she knows, including herself.
