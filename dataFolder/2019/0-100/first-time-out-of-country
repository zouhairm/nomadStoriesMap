Text: Me first time out of my country, i went to Australia with my boyfriend. We flew
  from Jakarta to Australia. First time arrive in Perth, it was cold.. hahaha but
  fresh air. I went to zoo to see kangaroos and koalas. I went to swan river and ring
  bells. I like the environment when people buy walk like robot in rush and not smiling
  each other,it was funny for me. Not like in my country, Indonesia, back home you
  can find people smiling all he time.
