Text: 'Caught betweeen breath taking moutain views and refreshing turquoise blue waters,
  is a city that took my heart away. A coastline of hundreds of beaches and Mount
  Olympus with ancient stories to tell. With mesmerizing street arts and mouthwatering
  Souvlaki and coffee, this city left my heart spell bound.

  And admits all the young blood and gung ho atmosphere, a fast paced life this city
  made me stop and look around, only to realize how beautiful life could be. This
  city taught me to live and love each moment, it taught me to take it easy. HALARA!!!
  Cheers'
