Text: "Was my first time in life, I decided to visit Slovak, at least for 2 nights.\
  \ An uknown place, without google it before. Even when my english is not entire\
  \ good, it was decided, visit a good place, historic as Bratislava is. \n\nHave\
  \ a good view, good castles, but isnt so good if you visit in Winter. Crowed with\
  \ snow, i get stock inside inches of snow, that after I\xB4ve been in my hostel\
  \ I was looking how to dry my boots."
