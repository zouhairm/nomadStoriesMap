Text: "I loved a relatively sheltered life in eastern Tennessee and I was ok with\
  \ that. Until I met my fianc\xE9, that is. He showed me all the wonders of the world\
  \ and then I caught the bug; the travel bug. Since then I\u2019ve been more cras,\
  \ better cultured and more understanding of why people live the way they do. This\
  \ is the story of a southern woman finding herself in travel through a series of\
  \ fortunate events."
