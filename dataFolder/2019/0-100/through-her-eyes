Text: "A women wanders through the world and sees life from a point of view most people\
  \ would never look at things as. She turns daily activity\u2019s into a vivid image\
  \ almost into a movie. Her precise attention to detail and vulnerability to emotion\
  \ invites the reader on a journey to a higher perspective. The reader will never\
  \ look at the world the same after reading a story like this."
