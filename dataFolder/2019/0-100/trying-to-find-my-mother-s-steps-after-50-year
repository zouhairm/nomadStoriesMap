Text: I would like to travel to South Africa to find where my mother grown up. She
  lived in White River for 16 years. I would like to make a video for her to show
  how is this place today after so many years. I didn't have the opportunity to make
  this big trip, I don't know if you will give it to me but I will never let it down.
