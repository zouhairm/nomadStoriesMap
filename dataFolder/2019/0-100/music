Text: "I've always understood people the way they hear music. That tells a lot about\
  \ them. \nI'm specialized in Salsa, Bachata and Zumba. Going to Cuba has always\
  \ been my dream. Getting to know how they love and hear Salsa music is all I ever\
  \ wanted to know. \nBecause everywhere I go, I connect with people though music.\
  \ \nSo this is the leap of faith I'm taking to see if I can actually get to go to\
  \ Cuba!"
