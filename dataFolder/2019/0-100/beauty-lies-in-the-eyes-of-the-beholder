Text: "Travel stories are intriguing, they tell us stories not just about a place\
  \ but also about it\u2019s uniqueness and it\u2019s culture. Through the stories\
  \ we get to live a life we always dream of. It makes us forget about our present\
  \ situation and plunge into the unknown, sailing through it\u2019s  beauty and the\
  \ greatness. There\u2019s a thrill in the unknown, there\u2019s an excitement and\
  \ that\u2019s what pushes us to go deep within and explore the world beyond our\
  \ imagination and in the process discover it\u2019s hidden treasures."
