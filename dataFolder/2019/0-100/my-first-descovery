Text: "not sure where to start? Planning a trip to London might be overwhelming indeed\
  \ and especially by  staying in central London you can see much more in less time.\
  \ Ultimately this will save money not just on transportation, but also on your overall\
  \ trip budget, because you\u2019ll need less days in order to see just as much."
