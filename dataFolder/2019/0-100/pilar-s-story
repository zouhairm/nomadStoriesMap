Text: "New places. New people. New soundtrack.  New passport stamp. \n\nExperience\
  \ the world through my eyes as my journies take me around the globe.\n\nHiking,\
  \ drinking, eating and shopping are some things to do all the while absorbing the\
  \ colors tastes, smells and sensations of the foreign yet familiar world we live\
  \ in."
