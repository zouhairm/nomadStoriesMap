Text: "Once upon a time, i went the political capital of my country for the funeral\
  \ of my Mum, i was not able to tighten the security belt of the plan, i did not\
  \ to ask to anyone, i learned from. after that, i was sitting closer to the window\
  \ so that i could see down how it looked like, that was the biggest mistake i made.\
  \ \nwhen i having a look in the window, i was automaticaly sick, feelling dizziess\
  \ and i felt like having a stomach out of me out me. the remaing on the top."
