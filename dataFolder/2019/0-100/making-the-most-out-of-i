Text: I love traveling but more importantly I love learning new cultures and history.
  There is always something to learn from the unknown. I don't get to do it that often
  because of school and financials. It is one of my passions and one of my ambitions
  to travel and get to know more about the world and what it has to offer. Also, this
  is a way to share my story. As a communications professional my life has been in
  the formation of storytelling and sharing my world with others.
