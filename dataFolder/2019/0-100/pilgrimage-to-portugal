Text: Through faith, hope, and love we take one step towards our destiny and God rushes
  to provide the way ahead. My Mami thrived through two rounds of breast cancer by
  hiking with the intention of finding her personal testimony to healing. Her pilgrimage
  to end all our ancestry pain at El Camino touches, moves, and inspires me to follow
  in her footsteps. An opportunity to travel write in Portugal ignites possibly of
  Latina unity.
