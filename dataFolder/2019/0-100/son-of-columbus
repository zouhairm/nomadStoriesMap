Text: Yes, iam son of Columbus, because i love to travel the world not for enjoying
  or selfies bcoz ,l want to know the culture and traditions of that country, I observed
  one thing in travelling is their is increase in bond of people and peace, not war
  ,travelling develops the world peace instead of doing wars .
