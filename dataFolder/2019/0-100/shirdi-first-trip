Text: "So i was like 16 years old when i got to know we are going for shirdi (religious\
  \ place) , me and my sister are very excited as it was our first trip\nAs soon as\
  \ we reached there we stayed in a hotel near by the sai temple and 2 am in the morning\
  \ we first took bath and lined up for having a look for Load sai and worship him\
  \ \nIt was a very peaceful moment and atmosphere was also very ambiguous\nI loved\
  \ that time"
