Text: "We travel not to explore but to understand and get to know more about the people\
  \ and place dwelling there.It\u2019s not only about beauty or tourism but also the\
  \ understanding and blending of people.Everyone and everyplace has a story and that\
  \ story can only be heard in the purest form if narrated by a native.travel the\
  \ world to see the world and be the change in this busy and developing world."
