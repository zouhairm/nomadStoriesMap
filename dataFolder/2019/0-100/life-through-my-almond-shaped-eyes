Text: I am someone who enjoys exploring fantastic spots in European cities and Portugal
  has always been one of itineraries that I want to do in the future. I enjoy writing
  about food, culture and places, finding something that clicks to my heart. I would
  really love to know the locals, telling their story and their daily life. I hope
  to explore the unknown and something new that will be amazing for others to learn
  when they read my story.
