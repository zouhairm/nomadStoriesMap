Text: 'I hope to find myself in a road of no trust, the silence of the unknown whispering
  in the night where the values are not define.

  The need of being alone observing a world where I''ve been lost , I need to confort
  my soul of being in long distance to the human being, traveling could be the answer
  of a universe without a word. I am Portuguese, the poet hidden at the other side
  of the sea.'
