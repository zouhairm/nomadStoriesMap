  \ something new! I\u2019ve already traveled over 35 countries in the world as I\
  \ have friends everywhere. We can share our stories and they showed me around their\
  \ life style and local culture. I am a professional tour guide in Japan. I know\
  \ not only popular sightseeing places but also hidden places where local love :)\
  \ \nI am passionated with sharing my experience to people who are interested in\
  \ travel!"
