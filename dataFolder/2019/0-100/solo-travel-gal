Text: "An African American girl traveling solo around the world, starting with the\
  \ roots she never had the opportunity to explore in Cuba. Meeting new people, eating\
  \ good food, and learning the culture as if she were a local. Maybe even find family\
  \ members. This would be the premise as she travels to Europe since there may be\
  \ family over there as well that she hasn\u2019t met. An immersion in the off the\
  \ beaten path destinations and events. You never know what your trip can become\
  \ with an open mind and a need to learn."
