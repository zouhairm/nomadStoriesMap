Text: 'My writings would,in nature hope to capture the breath of a city.The desires,hopes,aspirations,crests
  and troughs of a city.The evening melancholy,the windows and doors...Like how Joyce
  painted Dublin in words,I hope to see a city unfold and write the breath of it..


  Melancholy is travelers bed since he is travelling to what never was his and what
  never will be his.His is a state of perpetual departure and by these eyes,this state
  of being a guest...id like to mirror through my writings...'
