Text: My story details how to navigate a foreign place when the main sense of processing
  is audio instead of visual. Many people with learning disabilities would love to
  travel, but there is little about "how" to do it. What is transportation like? How
  does the language impact the ability to hear and understand directions? Is there
  noise pollution? What type of cultural and social expectations are attached to different
  foreign countries? These are all questions that help those with visual processing
  disorders explore new places comfortably.
