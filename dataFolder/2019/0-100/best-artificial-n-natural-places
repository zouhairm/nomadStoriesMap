Text: Natural environment place in Bali is one of the best place to visit. My family
  and I stayed in Ubud  Nothern part of Bali. Quite place and natural. The sounds
  of waterfall and sounds of birds shimmered in the morning. We went to visit original
  place to see traditional dancing and traditional crafts. Such a great experience.
  We got to see many things. Tourist and local mixed together. The hotel we stayed
  so natural without any air conditiner. The air from outside so fresh and cool.
