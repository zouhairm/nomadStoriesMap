Text: My travel story is about knowing different cultures and countries opens a door
  to happiness and your inner self, like being happy with small details that exist
  in our day to day life, but in the world we live in today. day, it becomes opaque
  with fleeting flashes so that as the years pass we realize everything we have to
  be happy and we do not take advantage of it. Leave my little footprint and show
  through words like being happy and laughing every day.
