Text: And there I was... in that train station with a thousand and one thoughts in
  my mind, I still felt that fear and that voice told me... it is not safe, better
  no hurdles, do not leave... nobody ever told me about that feeling that first feeling
  since you started the trip but now that I knew it I set out to beat it and that
  is how I am today on a beach tomorrow probably in the snow ....
