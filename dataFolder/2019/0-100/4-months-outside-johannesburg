Text: I had graduated from grade 12 in 2012 from a canadian high school, one month
  later I hopped on a plane to South Africa not really with any goal in mind. I just
  want to get out. There i met people from other parts of Africa and the World. There
  i just lived it rough. From there i went to Pakistan where i learned to live like
  the locals used to the daily heat motorcycle treks and such. Spent 3 years travelling
  the middle east.
