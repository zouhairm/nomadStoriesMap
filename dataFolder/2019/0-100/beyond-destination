Text: Travelling is about the moment where the people, culture, heritage of a destination
  is discovered. It's all about the new and exciting experience you obtain from an
  unknown place . The Streets,local , people,food and everything which contribute
  to the place and it's origin. The distance is not an excuse if the experience is
  worth it.
