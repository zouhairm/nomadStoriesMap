Text: 'I wanna start with the capital of Ottoman Empire, Constantinople and finish
  with Lisbon. All the way by train: Istanbul, Sofia, Belgrade, Budapest, Vienna,
  Prague, Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris, Madrid and reach to Lisbon. I would like to experience
  how everything changes from the most east part of Europe to most west part of it.
  And then write about Lisbon comparing with other capital cities. I plan to do this
  project in a month.'
