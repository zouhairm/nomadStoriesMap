Text: 'When I feel lost and tired about everything I decided to taken a break from
  all the things that''s made me felt that and I decided take a trip. When I thought
  that it was very fun because I never thought I did that.

  Then when I arrived to the country I felt like estranged because I didn''t know
  everything about this country but the days past and I met people.'
