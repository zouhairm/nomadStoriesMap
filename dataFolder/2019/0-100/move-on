Text: I moved on. Tried to start a new life. Try to forget my past and the problems
  i was having those complicated days. Swear i was praying to die until i got the
  opportunity to meet my real country, a place where i know i can grow and help myself.
  Where i can see everyday skies the same color i used to when i was a child, the
  place I've never met before, where i always wanted to be.
