Text: 'I will make a chronicle about the memory of 4 elderly people living in Lisbon
  to tell what it means to grow old in one of a city where there are almost no children
  and young people have migrated to other cities in Europe.

  The story will describe the place where these 4 people live, their personality,
  their desires, the ways in which they see the city and the difficulties of being
  an older adult in a city of old people.'
