  \ breeze.\nBlown away by the Green waters..\nblown away by the clear Blue skies.\n\
  Ain't it something like a paradise?\nBlown away by dewy meadows\nAnd sun shining\
  \ right next to hill..\nIt feels good here to chill..\nAin't you a beauty? \nAin't\
  \ you pretty?\nAin't you a jewel?\nIn this world so cruel\nYou cast a spell on me\n\
  And I don't mind..\nBecause you have been so kind..\nTake me in your lap\nAnd bliss\
  \ me with your fab..\nLet's go to a journey \nThrough your snowy mountains and sunny.."
