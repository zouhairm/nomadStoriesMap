Text: 'Trying to enjoy the air, wind, and water in a place is not easy, even a brick
  has its story, trying to find it and let it could be know as a record.

  Smell the flowers or the old woods in a bar with noname but try the best food and
  liquor recommend by local or any traveler there, then we could find the different
  side of this amazing.

  Visiting the bookstore or the liberaris are the important things, printing and real
  paper and book could tell the story.'
