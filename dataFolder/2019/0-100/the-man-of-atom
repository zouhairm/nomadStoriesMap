Text: I wana see how people live in different different places. What they think about
  life is someone have their different ideology about life. I believe  water, language,culture
  and thoughts are changes every miles. What I believe Human psychology is similar
  as universe. Their is no limits of thoughts. You can imagine anything from sitting
  at different places. I know nothing about Greece  but I know humans. And I want
  to listen them observe them. And their creations and how ancient Greece people build
  their houses and culture what they have given to their young ones
