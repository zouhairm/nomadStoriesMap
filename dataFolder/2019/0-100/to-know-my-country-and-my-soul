Text: "I am half Portuguese half Brazilian, I do have Portuguese citizenship but I\
  \ never have been there. My parents and my brother live in Portugal, I have relatives\
  \ all over the country and even though I couldn\u2019t visit my country yet. Portugal\
  \ is a big part of me that I wish to explore and know more about my origins. It\
  \ is a country that I miss even before know, it is my roots and my history. To travel\
  \ to this amazing country it would be a leap in the unknown that I somehow know."
