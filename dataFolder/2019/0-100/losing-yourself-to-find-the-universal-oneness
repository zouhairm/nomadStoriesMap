Text: "The instrument oneness!! \nA vibe lives inside her rawness. \nShe\u2019s the\
  \ mystery of the universe a life force of love & breathing all earths glorious energy\
  \ listening to Mother Nature\u2019s sounds, the Mesmerizing music playing in the\
  \ elegantly creative wind dancing with joy for all to admire, she was the colorful\
  \ mind, the wildfire of sunlight, the lovingly divine exposing her glowful rays\
  \ in the moons starlight darkness. \nA fulfilling calmness from an overwhelming\
  \ universal love , all creatures captivated & nurtured by her glittering soulful\
  \ shine her mind shows you the light - oneness."
