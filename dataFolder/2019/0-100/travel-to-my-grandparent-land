Text: "since i was a child, I always thought to travle to Portugal. My grandparents\
  \ borned in Algarve. I used to think that the issue to study tourism, has to do\
  \ with that.\nWith my recently jobs, I could travel to Europe, I did a express visit\
  \ to Lisboa and Oporto, and my heart was accelerate when I cross the Portuguese\
  \ border. \nAgain anf Again returns my child thoughts, and I analyzed why I could\
  \ not go to Algarve. \nfinally know i have the opportunity to travel to Portugal\
  \ and visit all of the country... This is my experience."
