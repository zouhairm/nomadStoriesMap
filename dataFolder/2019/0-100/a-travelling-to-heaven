Text: As i was just 10 years old.   I went to my mother's Parents house. As she died
  at that time when i was just 4 years old..  It was very hard time for me to remember
  that moment.. But they took me as their own child..  And took care of me..  It was
  just for some hours.  But in these hours.. I feel like a visit to a heaven
