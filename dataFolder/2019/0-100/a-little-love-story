  \U0001F1F9 to explore my best friends culture who is a flight attendant for Air\
  \ Canada. I feel completely in love with the architecture of the building, the fresh\
  \ air the island carries, foods,wines, friendships, festivals and fashion! I love\
  \ every thing about this island I traveled 3 more times total!! I can\u2019t get\
  \ enough of Portugal! It is a very beautiful culture. I hope to win a trip to Portugal\
  \ to take my best friend and relive our first trip together! My heart is full when\
  \ I am there!"
