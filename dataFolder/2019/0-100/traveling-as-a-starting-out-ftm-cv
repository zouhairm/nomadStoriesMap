  would open another door for me that I would like to see what is behind it. Traveling
  is what I always wanted to do jo matter if I wasn't ftm I would still want to travel
  around the world and take pictures and try new intresting foods.I am happier as
  who I am now not who I was before in I deserve to travel like anyone else
