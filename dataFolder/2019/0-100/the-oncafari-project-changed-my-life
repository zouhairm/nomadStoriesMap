Text: "Being a city girl I've never thought that the Brazilian wetlands would get\
  \ to me like it did, learning not only about the jaguars, but also the techniques\
  \ use to respect and protect nature, without the exploitation of the habitat. \n\
  Getting involved in the daily activities and I ended up becoming a part of the team\
  \ urging to makes a difference. The person that I'm now, nature aware and sustentability\
  \ activist it is all thanks to my jaguar bffs."
