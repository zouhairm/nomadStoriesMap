Text: "I was on a lonely island of Mykonos in the Mediterranean Sea and discovered\
  \ a treasure which I would cherish for life. The treasure of love. Love makes the\
  \ world go round. After a devastating failure, I was on a soul-searching odyssey\
  \ before I embarked upon the Great Oracle in Greece \U0001F1EC\U0001F1F7 that had\
  \ in golden letters inscribed \u201CKnow Thyself\u201D."
