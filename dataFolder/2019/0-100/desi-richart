  \ story is about my travel journey starting in India and ends in San Francisco.\n\
  An ordinary girl in India, marrries an IT professional and travels different corners\
  \ of the world and tries to make her identity and finally in SanFrancisco, does\
  \ something she loves through all the travel experiences she has gained over the\
  \ years. She writes, paints and runs a company, but there is strong reflection of\
  \ Indian identity in everything she does that\u2019s makes it unique."
