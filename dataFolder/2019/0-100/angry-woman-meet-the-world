Text: The experiences post an abusive relationship and the scars it left inside, all
  of us, the family issues it transformed into unberable situations and how traveling
  alone made me realize all of this. The calls of threat you receive and the threats
  I wish I made myself. Some corner maybe the one I find myself killing a man, out
  of anger and nowhere.
