Text: 'A girl who is a yoga traveler, wants to travel, learn and teach yoga to the
  different parts of the world. Experience the culture of the country, their food,
  life style and belief. So she visits the portugal and after all the beautiful experience
  she makes a fusion of portugal and indian yoga. Which is a beautiful combination
  of both the beautiful country''s culture.

  Then she invites them to visit india and learn indian style yoga and send indians
  to learn their culture.

  That''s my storyline.

  Thank you

  Namaste'
