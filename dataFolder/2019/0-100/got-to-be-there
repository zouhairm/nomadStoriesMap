Text: "With scenery so stunning it takes your breath away and sunsets so impressive\
  \ even Instagram told us to tone it down. It takes a while to get around the largest\
  \ region in New Zealand, but the journey is the best bit. \n\nFrom the highest of\
  \ mountains and stunning coastal scenery to copious rainforests and absolutely everything\
  \ in between \u2013 you\u2019re just spoilt for choice all of the way.\n\nAlong\
  \ your journey you will meet Coasters (real kiwi locals) who will provide you with\
  \ true Kiwi hospitality. And that's what I am waiting for.."
