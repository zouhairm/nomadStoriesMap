Text: "I am Syrian and I traveled to Lebanon then to Istanbul,turkey learned the language\
  \ there become a tv presenter then I moved to Berlin to learn German and take new\
  \ experiences.. \nand I always had some questions in my mind..\nDo you lose your\
  \ identity with integration?\nDoes our identity change? Or our perception of our\
  \ identity changes over time?\nQuestions I always try to find answer with meeting\
  \ new people and interview them to see that they also think about it"
