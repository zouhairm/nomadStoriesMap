Text: 'Around 100 years ago, my family left europe to establish in an unknown

  Argentina. They came with they culture and language, but throughout years they left
  them behind in order to fit to their new multicultural country. With this journey
  I expect to find my relatives left in Europe, learn about their lives and how are
  we bonded in our differences.

  It''s not just a personal journey, it''s the journey of every inmigrant descendent
  trying to understand it''s own past in order to comprehend the future.'
