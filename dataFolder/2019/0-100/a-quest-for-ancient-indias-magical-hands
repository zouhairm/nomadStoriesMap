Text: My trip was to mysor, one of the tourist destinations in India. The city that
  mesmerises with its impeccable uniqueness in architecture. The most famous Mysore
  palace always wonders with me with its perfection and artistic excellence in every
  nook and corner of the palace. Even the minute edge of the great domicile has its
  distinction. Also the very humple people of the city, cheap and healty food like
  idli, vadai, and the nunerous street food are tasty and pocket friendly. And all
  this makes mysore one of thr ever preferable tourist spot in India.
