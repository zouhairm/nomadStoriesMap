Text: My story would be about an adventure that my husband and I take into the unknown.
  We would travel day by day, exploring new places and finding new adventure. We are
  true sponanteous, adrenaline junkies. Ones who seek adventure. We seek creativity
  on a daily basis. My husband is a artist, a builder, and a inventer. I on the other
  hand am a dancer, realistist, optimist, and adventurest. This would be a truly remarkable
  adventure of a lifetime.
