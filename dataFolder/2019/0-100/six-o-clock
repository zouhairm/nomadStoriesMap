Text: "Girl watching every evening at six o'clock train. \nPoetical travelers who\
  \ gazed from behind the Windows, and the same distance in longing. \nDaddy takes\
  \ care of a small garden in the evening, and not raise his head towards the train\
  \ which passes uninteresting. \nDog near the fence, without moving from his place\
  \ no bark choppy to suggest that it has a role to play, and then shut up on all\
  \ manner of possibilities.\nGirl, one evening, get on the train and go away. \n\
  And father, one night, he dies, leaving the dog alone in the home."
