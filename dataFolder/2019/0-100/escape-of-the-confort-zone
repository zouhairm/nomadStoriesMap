Text: my travel history is for found ourselves, in the unknown, new places, new peoples,
  new cultures and colors, escape of the rutinary life, minimum one time of ours live
  and disfrute different things we unknown them, disfrute the little things too when
  we come back to the places we travel, if we come back of course, realease that the
  life is more than money and material things, accepting different ties of people,
  respect them, for who are they.
