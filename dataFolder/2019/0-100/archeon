Text: 'Bombay,-a-fun-city,-with-foul-smell-of-acetly-chemicals-coming-from-the-pharma-firms,-in-the-air-as-i-took-an-auto-from-kandivali-railway-station-to-sanyadri.-But-my-first-introduction-to-this-city-of-Maya-''worldly-affairs'',-was-not-the-Bandra-Terminus-that-i-had-got-off-early-at-4-am-nor-the-city-itself-but-the-people,--Ah!-First-time-i-fully-realised-that-the-people-make-a-city,-they-give-it-its-identity.

  At-the-local-train-platform-no-1,A-peddler-selling-leaves-of-Neem-and-Beetle-stood-with-us.-I-was-trying-to-register-so-much-in-my-brain,--the-clean-platforms,--the-different--languages-and-all,--that-i-did-not-realise-i-stood-very-close-to-the-tracks,-the-peddler-in-front-turned-and-strictly-asked-me-to-stand-behind-the-yellow-safety-line.-I-heeded-the-request-and-stepped-back,-well-beyond-the-yellow-line.

  The-peddler-wore-a-white-short-kurta-with-white-pjamas-and-a-white-''topi''a-boat-shaped-cap..-he-looked-proper-''Mumbaikar''.-

  We-were-to-board-a-local-train-from-Bandra-to-Kandivali,-our-ticket-was-made-for-Meera-Road.-For-local-stations-the-tickets-were-given-for-specific-stations,-so-often-you-would-get-ticket-for-some-additional-three-stations-if-you-wish-to-go-to-a-smaller-part-of-the-city.

  -After-we-waited-for-about-fifteen-minutes-a-train-came-but-it-was-for-another-station,-Confused-my-older-sister-asked-the-peddler-for-the-train-that-we-were-supposed-To-board-there.

  He-said-"Ah!-you-are-standing-in-the-wrong-platform,-it-is-the-platform-opposite-to-this-one,-you-can-get-there-by-crossing-the-bridge-"-He-added-"there-are-two-platform-no-1-in-this-station,-its-good-of-you-to-ask-of-me-otherwise-you-could-have-wandered-lost"

  Then-he-added-something-very-interesting-he-said-"its-fine-if-you-dont-ask-anyone-again-for-directions,-you-are-on-the-right-path-now"

  I-thought-to-myself,--normally-a-person-would-reconfirm-that-what-he-said-was-true-and-add-some-more-details-to-his-explanation-but-he-simply-hurried-ahead-of-us-towards-another-platform,-its-was-funny

  I-pondered-that-maybe-he-is-a-person-who-is-frequently-meeting-with--people-in-such-situations,-in-this-most-cosmopolitan-mega-city-of-India.'
