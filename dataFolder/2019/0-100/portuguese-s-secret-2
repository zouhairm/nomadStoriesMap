Text: One upon a time... There is a place which I've never felt. A place with a little
  of our ancestors, too many colors and open windows. Those windows are plenty of
  happiness and desires... How life is.. Yes, smelling the sun as it's flowers, flowing
  with the moon, as the sea does.. The winds of Portuguese's life are unexpected and
  in some way never and ever seen.
