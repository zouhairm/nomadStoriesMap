Text: There are Bhutanese Refugees in northern part of Nepal. They were forced to
  leave their country at 90s. They are living less than $1 a day. IOM started resettlement
  process for them in 2007-2017, most of them leave their Refugee camp and flew to
  others countries like United States, Australia, Denmark and others. There are still
  more than 4-5 thousands left in camp because they are scared to go new countries
  since they are uneducated and also they wants to go back their own country.
