Text: "Why the hell not.\nOur emotions are an universal language.\n\nI don\u2019t\
  \ know where life can and will take me, neither when or how, but being optmistic\
  \ and believing there\u2019s something out waiting to be seen, to be heard makes\
  \ life a little more exciting and sometimes surprising. Finding the good and kind\
  \ acts of people around the world is what we live for, unfortunately those are the\
  \ ones unheard and unseen. There\u2019s so much more good than bad is in so many\
  \ human beings. And I bleieve that. I believe how human conexion is so much more\
  \ powerful than words by itself."
