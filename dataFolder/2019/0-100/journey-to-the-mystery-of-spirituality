Text: When I reach  top of the hill made me to take a cool breath. Yes I was feeling
  the inner peace. It is the place known as "sivagirikkunnu" in Thiruvananthapuram
  District, Kerala, India. Where the great Sree Narayanaguru's "samadhi peedam" situated.Even
  the wind flows like a beautiful harmony. I just thought that why I am so late here.
  This is the moment I was dreaming years ago.
