Text: "Well, last summer I went to Rome. Onestly I didn\u2019t expect to find so much\
  \ humanity. There where people, real people who enjoyed life and loving food, not\
  \ just history monuments and fashion. I saw a lot of older who looked outside from\
  \ the window and smiled to me. This was really a good weekend. I also enjoyed the\
  \ city, the small streets, the ice cream and the sun \u2600\uFE0F"
