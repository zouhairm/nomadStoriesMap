Text: Pillars and Porcelain Darlings is a travel story covering exploration of New
  York City and my walk across The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. What
  makes this autobiographical tale as unique as few, is the story is equally over
  the people we meet when we travel moreso than the place we travel and losing ourselves
  to once again find ourselves. In addition, I am the author of 21 Independently published
  works covering Poetry, Plays, Film Scripts, Novels (both fiction and non-fiction),
  Critical Essays and a Short Story Cycle
