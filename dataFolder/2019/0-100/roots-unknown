Text: "Chile is a world of unknowns, within myself and within its own people. My story\
  \ is one of a woman (me!) whom grew up everywhere but her homeland. And now travels\
  \ to connect herself and all the lands visited to unify the soul, body & spirit.\n\
  \nThank you. \nMaria-Jesus Diaz\nCanadian, Chilean...traveler since birth!"
