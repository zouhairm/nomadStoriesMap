Text: While discovering local fare, I speak with women of all ages from all over the
  world about their medicine and magic gifted to them from their elders. These secrets
  of women told from their mother's tongue passed down the generations are the nuggets
  of life that builds the foundation we call family. Through song, food, and the beautiful
  art of storytelling, I aim to enlighten women's right of passage.
