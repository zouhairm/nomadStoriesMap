Text: 'To me writing gives me more satisfaction to persue my dreams in to reality
  with presence of eternity.

  Simple sense of words and good phrases  will make more intresting and touching stpries
  to deliver ...

  So its simple get directly to the heart rather than having more complicated words
  or stories that would make boring to read or deliver our thoughts....'
