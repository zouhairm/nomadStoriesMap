Text: A young physicist is summoned to one of the most important labs, but the unexpected
  happens! He finds a way to build something that will change the human history. In
  order to achieve his goal he needs something, that he doesn't manage to find nor
  he knows where to look for. This is what makes our young scientist travel along
  the country, amongst new people and new cities.
