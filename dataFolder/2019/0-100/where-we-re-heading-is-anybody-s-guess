  \ you\u2019ll need locals to guide you to hidden charms, continue digging treasure\
  \ and blow by sands made with time, you will amazing how the time machine brought\
  \ you back to the 50s inside the central wet market underground, take a shot of\
  \ whisky or tequila, busy bees \U0001F41D flying around in the early morning accomplished\
  \ by local news and train tempos, that\u2019s what I called a perfect day, you\u2019\
  ll always miss it every time you left HK"
