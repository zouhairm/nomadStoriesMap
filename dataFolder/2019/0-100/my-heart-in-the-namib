Text: My mother  and father  was born in Namibia. We children is born in South Africa,
  but my heart yearns for Namibia. The endless dry landscap bring back found memories,traveling
  at night, recognize the landscape....the excitement of the Christmas  we spend on
  my grandfather's farm. I miss my grandmother biscuits she made. To see how they
  slaughter a sheep,and you have to turn your back around. And the cousin's that tease
  you with dead animal. Oh how i miss being a child again....I miss Namibia or Suid-
  Wes.
