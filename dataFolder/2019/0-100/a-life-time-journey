Text: Travelling is what I've been desire for. Go to a place where I've never been
  before. Seeing the other side of this beautiful world. Discovering places, meet
  new people. Learning and seeing the beauty of this world to offer. The culture that
  is so beautifull and taste a good food that were there. It was a journey I always
  been dreaming of. It's about discovering not only discovering the world but also
  discovering myself. Infact travelling is good for souls haha.
