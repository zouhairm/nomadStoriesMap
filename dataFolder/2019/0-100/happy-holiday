Text: I have never traveled to Portugal. But I really want to be able to see the beautiful
  and beautiful Lisbon City. I also want to get to know Culture and tradition in Portugal.
  Because I am a Southeast Asian person who has a different cultural tradition. That's
  why I hope I can go to Portugal. In 2017 I have traveled to several European countries
  such as Spain and Belinda and Pranci. A very beautiful and beautiful country. Honestly,
  I was very impressed with the culture and historical buildings in Europe. Hopefully
  on this occasion I can visit Portugal
