Text: "Hello I am from Germany but still I want to apply. \n\nWhen I visited Portugal\
  \ the first time I was surprised about the amazing wooden scent of the very rich\
  \ red wines. Nowhere in the world I ever scented sth similar. I want to do a research\
  \ about this topic and include a story about a very authentic fado music bar, because\
  \ that is the place where wine is consumed in big amounts. This way I can dive very\
  \ deep into culture and people and explore the true lifestyle to the fullest!"
