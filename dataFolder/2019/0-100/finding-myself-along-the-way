Text: "In high school, we decided to take a trip to Canada. Quebec to be exact. We\
  \ were always told that Quebec had its own type of language and was its own little\
  \ place. I didn\u2019t truly understand that until I got there, all the stereotypes\
  \ and things we were told were true for this magical place. From dog sledding to\
  \ eating a ton of maple syrup it was fascinating to see how this section of people\
  \ live and function compared to the rest of the country surrounding them. That\u2019\
  s when I knew I wanted to travel."
