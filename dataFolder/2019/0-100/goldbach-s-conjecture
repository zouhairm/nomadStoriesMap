Text: No matter which corner in this earth, it must has it own story. I am a photographer,
  and I always keep my eyes open to find different stories. Like the local people's
  cultural architectures, their different life style and behaviour. I am good at capture
  those moments with my camera and let the pictures convey the feeling to more people.
  I'm now doing research on Portugal's church architectures. It helps me know more
  about their background. I hope can get the chance.
