Text: Traveling in 2018 from Colorado, to Lima, Cusco, and into the unknown areas
  of Peru. Our trip was to mainly to see Machu Pichu but found the bus ride and boat
  ride through the Amazon.rain forest to be the true magic. A journey with my 30 year
  old daughter and my son in law. I will return one day.
