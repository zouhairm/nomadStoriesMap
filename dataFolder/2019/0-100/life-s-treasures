Text: "In the city of Atlanta, tall buildings surrounds a small park with views anyone\
  \ can miss. \n\nOn a clear day, a traveler can ride the buses and trains around\
  \ and walk from the nearby stations to Centennial Park. The '96 Olympic park with\
  \ its wide lawns and tourist walks in the moderately busy city sits next to a grand\
  \ hall where artists from all over the world perform.\n\nNext to the building is\
  \ a old little rundown garage. If you go to the top, a view of awe surprises you\
  \ as you see the city in its glory."
