Text: Iv never know I been so passionate about new places. My friend was excited about
  helping me see new things, people, food. Most of time I wanted be alone, crossing
  streets, view arts and fashion. I feel like spirit don't need a guide connection
  with someones talking next to u.. But that impossible when u traveling with friends.
  So I decided next journey will be all and full mine.. That I can really feel all
  atmosphere under my skin, including joy and scares.. I start to dream.. How cool
  it's all can be.. I wanna share it to u some day.
