Text: "I bloody deserve it. \nA break I\u2019m talking about. \nI didn\u2019t realize\
  \ I would get it \nFloating through the clouds. \n\nRunning from my job,\nFrom days\
  \ of passing by. \nI didn\u2019t think I would get the chance \nTo swe the Eiffel\
  \ high. \n\nI bloody deserve a break I say. \nI\u2019ve worked so very hard. \n\
  It\u2019s hard to write continual stories \nSitting in your own yard."
