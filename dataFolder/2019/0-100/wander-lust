Text: I had been to Western ghats in karnataka,  India that is dharmasthala and hornadu
  where the climate was so cold and everything which was shed by green green... The
  coffee Plantation, the people around me and birds blue sky and the loving romantic
  nature I was in love with. But I also wish to go back to my memories and feel tranquility
  again!!! If that could happen. I am always ready for it. I eventually wish to visit
  once Italy, Spain, Bali and Hawaii in my life time I don't know when it is gonna
  happen
