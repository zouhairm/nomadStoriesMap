Text: I didn't know what to expect when I applied to get a scholarship for a PhD in
  Australia four years ago. I just knew I wanted a different life, a better life,
  somewhere else. Where I could actually do something for myself, for my future. And
  when I made it, a long, challenging, transforming journey started. An adventure
  that allowed me to finally get to know who I am. My life is still that journey now.
