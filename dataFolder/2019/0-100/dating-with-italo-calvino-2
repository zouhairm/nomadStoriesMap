Text: Italo Calvino is a writer who loved to describe and draw cities with words.
  There are many tales in which the characters relate to the cities and end up acquiring
  a self-knowledge through this relationship. In his novel The Invisible Cities, Marco
  Polo narrates and invents the empire of Kubla Klan and we are invited to know the
  cities that Marco passes. In this novel we will return to the cities of Klan, Marco
  Polo and Calvino and go through other times, but this time hand in hand with the
  writer, reinventing the invisible.
