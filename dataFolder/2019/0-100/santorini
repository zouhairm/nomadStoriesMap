Text: Santorini is a place where the writer flies without letting anyone know after
  she founds herself in all the mayhem of career choices . On the journey, she narrates
  so many anecdotes about her life which seems ordinary to her but in one way, she
  just was preparing herself all her life to escape like this. In Santorini, she founds
  herself in a spiritual way and also finds out how writing is something she needs
  to choose.
