Text: I traveled to Paris, France to find myself and ended up traveling to Amsterdam
  and Germany alone where I met so many wonderful people, did table dance, and explored.
  I learned that I love to capture every moment, I write about my adventures and stories.
  People I've met, stories shared and more.
