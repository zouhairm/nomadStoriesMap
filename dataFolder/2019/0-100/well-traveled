Text: "Lands and Stars have seen on this Beautiful destination. Waves and warmth wraped\
  \ oh so gentle against this virgin skin sent me swinging in all directions on life.\
  \ From the glimpses of honey bees to the sweet juices of mangoes laying at my feet\
  \ my innocence was frozen in time. \xA3 Lynnette Anderson 19"
