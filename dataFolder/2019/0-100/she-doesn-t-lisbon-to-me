Text: "\"There\u2019s plenty to see and do in Lisbon\" she said gawking at the hairy\
  \ pigeon on the sidewalk. If you\u2019re looking to escape the city for a day, traveling\
  \ to nearby Portuguese towns and villages is all too easy. With convenient and cheap\
  \ transport, you can discover a completely different side of Portugal just an hour\
  \ or two out of the capital."
