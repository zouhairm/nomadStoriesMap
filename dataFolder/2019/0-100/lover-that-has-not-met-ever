Text: Been 10 year since we are dating but life is making us suffer a lot. Always
  try to plan something to meet but it never happen. There are so many reasons why
  it never such as family, study, financial problem or we want to give me. But this
  is last we are trying to meet if not this love story will not end happily. It will
  rather a heart broken one..
