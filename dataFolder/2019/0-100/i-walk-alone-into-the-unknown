Text: "For years I\u2019ve been waiting for people to be able to go traveling with\
  \ me. I keep holding myself back and staying exactly where I\u2019ve always been,\
  \ a small farm town in California. As a true iPhone addict, I\u2019m constantly\
  \ on Instagram checking out everyone else\u2019s life through pictures assuming\
  \ they\u2019re having a hundred times more fun than I am. I\u2019m so tired of doing\
  \ nothing and comparing myself. It\u2019s finally my chance to free myself into\
  \ an unknown adventure, similar to Captain Marvel or in Mama Mia. Portugal feels\
  \ right."
