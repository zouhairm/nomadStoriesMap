Text: Indonesia consists of beautiful islands. These islands are neatly connected
  by marine waters that are very rich in diversity. Each island has diverse traditional
  cultures. Different cultures will certainly create different human behaviour. Therefore,
  if we want to tell about Indonesia, we will not run out of ideas. Indonesia can
  be known for its diversity of natures, Indonesia can be known for its diversity
  of cultures, Indonesia can be known for friendliness of its people, and of course
  Indonesia will be come easily known through travel stories that are packaged in
  an interesting and unique way.
