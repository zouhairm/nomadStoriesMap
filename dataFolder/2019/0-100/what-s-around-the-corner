Text: "Captivating cultures, I walk thru the streets letting thrill drip from my skin.\
  \ My lips crave the experience of different foods, while my chest beats to the rythum\
  \ of the cobblestone streets. Every second seems to be another lifetime lived thru\
  \ my eyes. I'm living in this moment. \n( The basis of my sorry would be my experience\
  \ of these cultures along with photos I take while there because I'm also a photographer.\
  \ The above sample is based off of how I feel about the experience while remaining\
  \ vague enough due to the fact iv yet to go. )"
