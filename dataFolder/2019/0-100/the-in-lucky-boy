Text: "When I was traveling through major part of South India. I was thinking that\
  \ I am the unlucky person  who born in a middle class family. But by seeing other\
  \ people's defficulties I came to know that I am enjoying my time and life. And\
  \ I am thank full to the God who created me as I am now!*!*:*:*;*!* \n         \
  \                       END"
