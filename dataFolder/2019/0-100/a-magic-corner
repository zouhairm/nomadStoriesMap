Text: "My adventure begins in Tasco, Mexico. I say it begins because although it had\
  \ already passed a few days, this place was the door to real magic for me. With\
  \ narrow streets, \u201Cdonkeys\u201D that are not animals but transport people\
  \ and a lovely white purity painted everywhere, this place transmits the happiness\
  \ of its culture and its friendly people. Ornaments of pi\xF1atas in the heavens\
  \ and a church in the center that floods the view and makes you travel to another\
  \ world. Of course, until I hear my brother say: if I ever get married, I want it\
  \ here."
