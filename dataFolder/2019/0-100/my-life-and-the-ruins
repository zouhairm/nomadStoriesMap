Text: 'Walking into the wide blue is me anf mh trusty shoes. Not too much just enough
  to make a trip in the great outdoors.

  Nothing to see but natures bounty galore, no smog no traffic no more.

  Just one on one under that big blue blanket we call the sky.

  Seeking out the truth and knowledge to be held.'
