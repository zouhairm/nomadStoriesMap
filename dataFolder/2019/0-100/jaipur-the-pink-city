Text: I visited Jaipur, India. It is very good place. The full taste of tradition.
  You can feel u came into some palace where still kings are exist but nothing like
  kings are there due to fort you can enjoy the pupet show, nature and the view on
  the top of fort. Too many forts are there . Still queens tomb are there like ajmer
  fort, jal mahal. In food you can enjot dal-baati churma purely taste into ghee.
  The taste like the heaven pure food. Meauem  also there. You can watch old utensils
  which are used in kings era.
