Text: "Travel isn\u2019t always pretty. It isn\u2019t always comfortable. Sometimes\
  \ it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that\u2019s okay. The journey changes\
  \ you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness,\
  \ on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave\
  \ something good behind."
