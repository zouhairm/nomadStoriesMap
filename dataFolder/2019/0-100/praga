Text: "I did not expect to see how the culture of that place is completely different\
  \ from mine, which I am Italian. They have other ways of doing and of putting themselves,\
  \ middle-aged people are more closed, while with young boys it becomes immediately\
  \ friendly. I was able to visit some historical places in Prague and now I know\
  \ the history and the dramas that over the years have had to endure. It is a fascinating\
  \ city, in turmoil and growing. Beer is great\U0001F37B"
