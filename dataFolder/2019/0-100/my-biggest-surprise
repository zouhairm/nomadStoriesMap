Text: When I went to India to meet my in-laws, my personal experience was not very
  pleasant, but it was falling into the background and not letting it ruin my trip.
  My husband planned after several days in Hydreba another internal flight to New
  Delhi where we rented a car and toured the precious and majestic places like the
  Taj Mahal, the city of Jaipur. What a fascinating culture and experience, the indescribable
  food of divine. Now after 4 years of marriage I separated but I will always thank
  my husband for our wonderful trip to India.
