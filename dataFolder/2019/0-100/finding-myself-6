Text: "Looking to reconnect with myself in a place very far from my city. \nLooking\
  \ to connect with history, religion, language and culture while finding newness\
  \ through this personal crisis. \nLooking for love beyond physical!!!!!!\nShowing\
  \ the world what beauty is far beyond conventional!!!!!\nI feel the need of reconnect\
  \ with the world through colors, flavors forms!!!"
