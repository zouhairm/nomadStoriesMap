Text: I have never travel a lot but would love to travel and experience the culture
  of other country and learn their culture and the way the live travelling and seeing
  the beauty of the country and tell the story of how you see the country and how
  it makes you feel. The way we travel it shouldn't be for only fun but should  also
  to go and learn and gain knowledge of the place you travelling to learning about
  the culture and the history ,that makes it good to understand people and the place
  to and how they do things.
