Text: I had recently been to Surat for a moot competition, besides the hours being
  spent at the University , we utlizied the rest by travelling to various gullies
  of the cities and tasting the delicious food , and shop the varities of clothes,
  it's famous for Ghadi. It's a sweet dish , produced only out there, and even a dish
  known as Locha which would fill your stomach in the breakfast itself. Travelling
  is fun, being a wanderlust and getting lost connecting with the locals and finding
  something new.
