Text: "So, I was paid last week. After 6 months of saving , working late nights, grulling\
  \ shifts going the extra mile I had done it ! FINALLY ! Hard work pays off ! \n\
  I've booked my tickets to the land of the elephants ..... One of my childhood dreams.\n\
  \nUnchartered territory - eek ! Best go see the doctors first . Shit! Panic! Do\
  \ I need a visa ? Will the elephants even like me? \n\nFor sure there is a burning\
  \ desire in me to explore Africa."
