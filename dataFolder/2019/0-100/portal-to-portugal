Text: "Travel is something where everyone should do it ,once in their life time !\
  \ And if you don\u2019t see places then you missed the best chance  to see the world.\n\
  I have traveled to few places where I stand as a witness to this marvellous creation\
  \ and this beautiful life.\nI can only say that it gave me happy and sad tears,\
  \ as life is short we need to explore, experience and express the life \u2728\u2764\
