Text: "Traveling Is Beautiful And Natural Feeling, Though I Haven't Traveled Out Of\
  \ My Country, But I Have Plans To Do So.\n I Have Traveled Places In My Country,\
  \ Because It's At Least A Big Country, Visited The Zoo, Beach, Mountains, etc. Though\
  \ It's A Very Hot Country, In West Africa, But A Bit Enjoyable Because Of The People\
  \ In The Environment, And It's A Busy Country Too, Because The Citizens Are Catering\
  \ For Themselves, And It's An Entertaining Country, Because It's Main Country Talent\
  \ Is Comedy, So There Is A Lot Of Smiles On Faces."
