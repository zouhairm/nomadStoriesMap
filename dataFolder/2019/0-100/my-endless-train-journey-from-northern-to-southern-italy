Text: 'I''ve used to do a lot of train journeys from Bologna (where I studied) to
  Bari (where I live), and vice-versa.

  I''ve never got bored, however, because every single travel gives me different sensation
  watching the myriad of towns that I could see through the train windows. Over the
  months and years, I''m starting to consider myself as a "citizen" of those towns,
  I recall some particular buildings and imagine their history, or how life could
  have been there.

  In the end, every single travel became a travel into myself.'
