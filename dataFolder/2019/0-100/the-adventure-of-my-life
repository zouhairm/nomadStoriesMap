Text: "It was like being in an American film for three months, immersed in a paradise\
  \ where only the gods can live.\nWith 18 years of age, my first adventure abroad,\
  \ with the warmth of Texas, working in a summer camp. What a wonderful experience!\
  \ \nNow I have friends from USA, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and from all around my\
  \ country. I learned much more than I imagine, now I am a citizen of the world.\
  \ And this was the beginning of something wonderful. I love traveling and I will\
  \ never stop doing it. This is me."
