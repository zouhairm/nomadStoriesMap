Text: 'I started travelling back in 2014. I wanted to discover the land of the ''punt''
  located at the northern part of somalia. I learned so many things in that place.
  I also went through the hidden pridise in the lower Jubaland of somalia (ras kamboni).
  It was a loving and cool place. Though there is higher level of insecurity but i
  discovered and learn alot from the people. Locals are very welcoming there great
  advantures cool waterfalls, great smell at the northern part of northern part of
  somalia.

  Wow what a wonderful place.'
