Text: "My first time visiting Cura\xE7ao I was blown away by the beauty of the island.\
  \ I quickly found wonderfully friendly local people that took my friend and I on\
  \ a tour around the island. I think the best part was the constant breeze and eating\
  \ outside with breathtaking views of the ocean. The sunsets were almost magical.\
  \ I never wanted to leave."
