Text: I've travelled to many beautiful places in Indonesia, where i am come from.
  I've seen and experiencing many waterfalls, some mountains, lot of rivers, and a
  number of beaches. I've also had the 'Me Time Travelling' in luxurious way. But
  nothing makes me feels sober rather than go to remote island of Indonesia, having
  travelling's time and helping people in the same time, and after it all ends at
  the night, i could sit under the sky to see beautiful stars with boiled corn and
  a glass of coffee. I didn't expect to find it before.
