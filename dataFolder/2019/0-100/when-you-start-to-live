Text: 'It''s not were, it''s not with who, it''s when and how would you start to live,
  to love, to meet, and take your own decisions about who you are and what do yo want
  to do with your life.

  Who are you?

  Is it what you expected? Isn''t, right?

  All we need to learn how to connect with nature, with people, and ourselves.

  It''s time to live.'
