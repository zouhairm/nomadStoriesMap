Text: Dubai, everyone's dream destination to visit once in a lifetime that was my
  first thought of Dubai, well it was the best family trip ever. Dubai is a place
  where you are free to explore, free to roam around, meet new people, try out different
  cuisines, learn the culture, it was a trip where I let out my fear of anything.
  It was a dream come true for a young woman like me. Dubai is a place for solo trip
  or 3-4 friends group trip. For those who have not visited Dubai, I highly recommend
  to visit the amazing, beautiful Dubai.
