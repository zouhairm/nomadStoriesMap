Text: I was born in india and after my high school, i went to see different provinces
  and cultures in India. I was surprised to see how people are different in their
  way of living coming even from a neighbour province. Their food, clothes, way of
  eating, cars, and perspectives were so rare than what i grew up in. I fell in love
  with the difference and experienced it within 2 months. Since then i have a passion
  for travelling more than just to see and explore new places but also to learn and
  adapt their ways of living a life.
