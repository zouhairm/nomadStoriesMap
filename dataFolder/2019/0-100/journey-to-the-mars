Text: 'World is a beautiful place to explore and sometimes you take it for granted.
  This is my story, country to country, coast to coast, seek a hidden secret from
  every abbys. This is a journey to the Mars.


  You cannot find your true self through your routine, the best way to expand you
  mind is through adventure. I have been to eleven countries and eager to have more
  and more. Until I reach my final destination, Mars.'
