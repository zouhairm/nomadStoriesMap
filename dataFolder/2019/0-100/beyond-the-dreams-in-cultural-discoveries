Text: 'There is a little knowledge about Portugal, we might have tried food from the
  country or heard stories of adventure but moreless, Portugal is the country of unbelievable
  cultural turn.


  My first amazement is the Cape St. Vincent. The place is the last point of Europe,
  the place which makes you feel free.'
