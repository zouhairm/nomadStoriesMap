Text: "I\u2019m a romanian girl who found love in Chile. \nI\u2019m on a constant\
  \ journey to find more about myself and discover this beautiful world that is constantly\
  \ changing. Celia Cruz said that \u201Cla vida es un carnaval \u201C and I\u2019\
  m always open to take risks and accept every culture. My wish is to be able to write\
  \ and let others now about the hidden treasure that our planet has to offer . This\
  \ world is my book and the first chapter will be a trip to Portugal."
