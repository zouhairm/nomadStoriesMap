Text: "I\u2019m Portuguese but have never been to Portugal. Growing up my family would\
  \ tell me about how beautiful the land is, and how my grandparents thrived there.\
  \ I feel a disconnect with my background and want to experience it first hand. The\
  \ stories from my parents, aunts, uncles,  and grandparents are amazing, however,\
  \ I want to see if I can find my own connection with the beautiful country."
