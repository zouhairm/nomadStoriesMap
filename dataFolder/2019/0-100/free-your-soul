  \ learned a lot about myself and the people itself. I want to go into an adventure\
  \ that make me meet people from all over the world ! I want to know their stories\
  \ and what they have for me to learn . I want to win this because I want to know\
  \ what's outside ! What do life has to show me\u2764\uFE0F"
