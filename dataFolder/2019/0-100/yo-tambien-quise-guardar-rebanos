Text: "I wanna go to Portugal to live under my own skin the magic that lives there.\
  \ Find a connection with Fernando Pessoa\u2019s land and discover things about him\
  \ and me. All the philosophy writen there could have a bit of perspective. As a\
  \ Mexican I would like to work there in different things, to feel, to know how is\
  \ being there. Feel myself a local (or try to figure). The adventure between poetry,\
  \ work, loneliness builds a romantic view for memories. Memories that I want to\
  \ write and turn then into poetry."
