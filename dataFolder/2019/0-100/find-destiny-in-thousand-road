Text: "All the time we lost. Lost person, relationship, connection or even ourself.\
  \ We need a thousand journey for getting back together. Soul, mind and body. Sadness,\
  \ loneliness or even anger it's fragile us. We have to be stronger as an individual\
  \ not group. \n\nSoo through the journey we can find our destiny. Why we have to\
  \ live."
