Text: "When I arrive to a country, I'm always expecting to see a million of places,\
  \ visit museums, talk to the locals and try to learn a bit of their language and\
  \ culture. \nWhat I'm never expecting is to taste the new culture, but after visiting\
  \ Sao Paulo in Brazil and tasting a lot of it's food, cheese, garlic and lime will\
  \ always be reminders of this beautiful country. As tomato, olive and ham are reminders\
  \ for me of Spain."
