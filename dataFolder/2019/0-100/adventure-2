Text: "It's easy to feel like you don't have time to read literature \u2014 especially\
  \ hefty works by classic novelists. Between busy jobs and hectic weekends, cracking\
  \ open a lengthy book that tackles humanity's biggest questions doesn't always seem\
  \ like the most fun pastime. \n\nLuckily for us, many writers famous for their long\
  \ sagas wrote short stories too.\n\nHere are some suggestions for poignant stories\
  \ from the world's most beautiful writers, all of which you can read in the time\
  \ it takes to scan your newsfeed."
