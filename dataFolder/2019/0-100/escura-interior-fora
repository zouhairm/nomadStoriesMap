Text: 'There were fantastic lands. Unknown culture and amazing nature. No fear, just
  hear. I thought I could stay but I had To leave. Finally, I''ve found myself in
  Costa Rica, Panama and then Mexico.

  I knew I dis not want to stop moving, learning Spanish and smile to life and the
  ones who gave me the same light. Mine is brighter now. Thank you America. Today
  I love Portugal... enjoying every minute as a gift from the stars.'
