Text: "My flight took of at the early hours in the morning. I was so excited for a\
  \ journey to a new place with new people, new food, and new experiences. The plane\
  \ landed in Lisbon at noon just in time for lunch. The sun is out and the sky is\
  \ clear and I\u2019m ready to take on my first day. \nAs I take my first few steps\
  \ outside of the airport I notice the warm air, people laughing and hugging. I thought\
  \ to myself this will be the experience that I learn a new culture."
