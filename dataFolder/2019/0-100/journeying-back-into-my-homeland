Text: Traveling is synonymous to discovering oneself. My travel story begins upon
  my return to my country having been away for six years. I will visit places that
  promote the uniqueness of my country and the fusion of cultures over decades of
  colonization and foreign influences. I would like to feature local groups in various
  places that contribute to the environment, conservation and community building.
