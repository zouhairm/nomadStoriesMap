Text: "My story is a first hand account of the first time I traveled alone.\nAs a\
  \ study abroad student living in a small town near Manchester I was bright eyed\
  \ about all the world that I\u2019d be able to see. And my first experience of the\
  \ world was nothing like I could have ever imagined. \nAlthough it wasn\u2019t an\
  \ amazing first experience. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world"
