Text: My girlfriends and I have been saving for over a year to travel across Europe.
  We have known each other since we were 2 and have been very close up until graduation,
  when we all moved away from each other. This trip is a way for us to reconnect and
  make new memories. We starting in England, going to Switzerland, Spain, France,
  Portugal, Germany, Italy, Croatia, and Greece. We are planning on couch surfing
  and staying in hostels, with the occasional luxury treat. We plan on doing a travel
  blog the entire time, documenting out experiences. We leave May 3rd.
