  I like to see scenic places such as: \nMountains, valleys, forests and other historical\
  \ places.\nI want to meet different people and get information about and want to\
  \ be socialized with them.\nI will have good memories regarding my travel and will\
  \ try to be in touch with the people whom I meet.\nI will keep that ( Travel ) as\
  \ a memory and write about what I get from my experience."
