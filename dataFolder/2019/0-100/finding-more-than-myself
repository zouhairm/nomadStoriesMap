Text: "When I traveled for the first time and not just as a tourist, when I went to\
  \ live in United States for a year and to finish my last year of high school I found\
  \ more than myself. \nI didn\u2019t speak English when I got there, it was my first\
  \ time on a plane being 18 years old, first time getting out of my country Argentina\
  \ and much more. \nEvery single day that passed by I found it something new as I\
  \ will share in this story with all of you."
