Text: "Last year my son and I took a plane to Punta Arenas, Chile, expecting to know\
  \ the national park \u201CTorres del Paine\u201D and the south of our country. \n\
  I knew people of all over the world travel thousands of miles to get the opportunity\
  \ to know those places, so I thought maybe it\u2019s worth it. But the truth is\
  \ that the reality exceeded the expectations. There are no words to describe the\
  \ magnificent of the creation of the earth in this most purest form of all."
