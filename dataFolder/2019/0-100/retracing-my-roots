Text: I'm Swiss, Portuguese, Angolan. I grew up internationally mainly in South East
  Asia. As my mother raised me on her own since I was very young, I have very little
  connection to my Portuguese and Angolan side. Traveling to Portugal and retracing
  my roots will lead to a fascinating story of a cultural heritage once lost but found
  again. A travel story about taking a leap of faith and seeing where it leads. You
  never know what you'll find, as the saying goes "Aim for the moon, if you miss don't
  worry you'll land amongst the stars."
