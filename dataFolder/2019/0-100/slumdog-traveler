Text: My destination is long long far. I start my first journey with only 30 rupees
  in my hand from my native village to a city of assam, india. This was guwahati when
  i was 13 year. And from that i am keep going and going. Now i m 19 year old and
  i travels almost every nook and corner of india. Many difficulties arrived when
  i was planning to go.As i am student, my father dont allow me to gone. And also
  money problem is one of them. Now i am planning to go out of india.
