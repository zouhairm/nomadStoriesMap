Text: "Standing in the middle of Rua dos Douradores I find myself following the steps\
  \ of Portugal\u2019s most accomplished writer. Analyzing past thoughts while giving\
  \ the mondain meaning. Deriving day dreams from scenes in everyday life. Reality\
  \ came and found me, do I fight it or join."
