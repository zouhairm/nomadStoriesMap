Text: "Nowadays being part of something has become a huge element in somebody\u2019\
  s identity. As a Mexican I have known so many things about my culture but also I\
  \ have experienced the doubts and misleaded idea so of my cultures. Those doubts\
  \ made me think about \u201Cwhat does it mean being Mexican\u201D. A trip to the\
  \ self understanding. A journey of a culture and a discovery of an identity. Through\
  \ this trip I want to show the world what being Mexican means and communicate to\
  \ all the identity of my country. Not everything it\u2019s about tacos, tequila\
  \ and parties."
