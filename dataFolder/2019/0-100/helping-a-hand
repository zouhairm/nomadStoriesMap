Text: 'I will travel to Costa rica to enjoy the beautifull landscape and get in touch
  with the locals and their culture. I will attempt an volunteer project and help
  see turtles get back home in a safe way.

  I also hope to help locals with whatever i can help them with. Costa rica has been
  on my bucket list for a long time now because in my opinion it is such a pretty
  country with the most beautifull coast and forests. The people there seem very kind
  and openminded and i am so excited to go meet them.'
