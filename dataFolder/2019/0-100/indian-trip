Text: 'Last month I went to India.

  When I arrived I started exploring neighborhood and villages, talking with local
  people and doing a photo reportage about their lifestyle.

  The most strange fact is that they like take photo or selfie with european people
  must of all if they have white skin and light/colored hair.

  I had 1000+ selfies with strangers and it was amazing, I felt for a while, like
  a hollywood vip.'
