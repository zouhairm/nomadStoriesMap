Text: This is about a girl in her mid-twenties.  She ended up homeless with her mother.
  Nobody wanted to help them. Everybody is out for themselves. Except for a few. So,
  they made it work in a homeless shelter. Until the end of 2018. The young woman's
  mother ended up in the hospital. She was given 30 days to go to stay with a friend
  or family. She remembered the only family member that would take her in. She doesn't
  realize cons. Just the pros.
