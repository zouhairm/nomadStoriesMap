Text: "I haven't traveled and I never planned until recently when I realised that\
  \ there are billions of people in the world and they have different cultures, background,\
  \ history and what not \u2014 but if there's something which is common is emotions\
  \ \u2014 I want to travel the world and get to know people and their heartbreaks,\
  \ their emotions and want to tell everyone that it's okay not be okay."
