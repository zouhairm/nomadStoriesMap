Text: "Lunacy of a bottle of marbles scattered on the floor \nSwaying trees and Ice\
  \ clad mountains \nBeautiful flowers and blue skies\nChirping birds and dancing\
  \ streams \nCold water and hot sun \nIt was lunacy \nIt was like playing with marbles\
  \ \nThe place was Kashmir \nAnd I was the Child playing around ."
