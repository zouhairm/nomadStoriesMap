Text: "Just imagine being in your grandmothers house for the first time , even though\
  \ you\u2019ve known her your whole life but you never went to the country where\
  \ she is from . Being able to be there with her, waking up to the bright light down\
  \ near the equator connecting with the people and most importantly the women who\
  \ loves you maybe even more then your own parents."
