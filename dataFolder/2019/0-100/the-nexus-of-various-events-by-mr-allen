Text: Landing in Portugal with nowhere planned to sleep I travel throughout the country
  experience the history and culture that is Portuguese. Having a complete open mind
  I try all local foods an delicacies, experience any festivals and/or events and
  take in the natural landscapes and historic sites from land to sea. Travel to live
  like a local.
