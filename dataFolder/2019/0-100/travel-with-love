Text: "I and my husband are very fond of traveling and exploring different cultures\
  \ and life styles,  since our marriage we had decided to travel the world.\nFrom\
  \ india we traveled to brazil where we realized we had all together a different\
  \ and positive view for all the aspects in life. \nIt is said that the higher you\
  \ go you get a better view, which we feel is so true. \nWe are looking forward for\
  \ more such experiences in life where travel plays a key role in doing so. \nThank\
  \ you so much."
