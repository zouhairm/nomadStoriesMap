Text: 'A young student of Architecture visits Lisboa, in Portugal, with a friend of
  her.

  Once in the city, they find a very misterious place, covered in Azulejos. They enter
  it, and find themselves in a labirinth, from which they can escape only reordering
  some Azulejos, part of a story. Every wall has an episode of this story on it. Once
  the first episode is complete, the two friends are brought into it, and they find
  themselves inside the story.'
