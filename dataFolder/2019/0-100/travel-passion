Text: 'It was great experience, coming from a Country like India.

  Where you dont know culture of Germany.

  And language is also entirely different.

  Met many people in different cities.

  Anplace with lots of diversity in culture.

  Was great fun meeting number and enjoying beer with different kinds of people.

  Specially in place, Berlin is very lively. Can visit numbered of party places at
  different streets.

  Best part is parties run till night on weekends.

  And also if you place is surrounded by number of beautiful Countries around you.'
