Text: "I have a friend who, when I return from a trip, never asks me, \u201CHow was\
  \ your trip?\u201D She knows that I would give her a long, rambling answer: \u201C\
  \u2026 and then \u2026 and then \u2026 and then.\u201D So instead, she says, \u201C\
  Tell me about one thing that really stood out for you.\u201D That\u2019s what I\u2019\
  d like you to do in this travel essay you\u2019re writing."
