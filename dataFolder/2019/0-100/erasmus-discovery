Text: "Italy was one of my first country in Europe that I traveled. I had really nice\
  \ experience in that country and I made a lot of friends there. But I fell in love\
  \ with this country and people they are really so kind and friendly. I was eating\
  \ pizza every day it\u2019s something unbelievable for me. I traveled 15 cities\
  \ in Italy all are much more beautiful from each other. Just loved that trip."
