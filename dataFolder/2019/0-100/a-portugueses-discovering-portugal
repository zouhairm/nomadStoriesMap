  \ \nI already visit most of the big European capitals but i\u2019be never been a\
  \ tourist in my own country. \nI love to write but I never tried to write about\
  \ my trips because I didn\u2019t know how to put in words all the great things I\u2019\
  ve seen.\nI\u2019ve done two interrails so far, but I want do discover more and\
  \ more"
