Text: "I once joined the circus to be a preschool teacher. I learned more about the\
  \ world, and more importantly- about myself, in three short years. \n\nI would love\
  \ to continue traveling and recount crazy situations I encounter. As a former student\
  \ of anthropology, there\u2019s no better way to learn about our crazy world than\
  \ experiencing it."
