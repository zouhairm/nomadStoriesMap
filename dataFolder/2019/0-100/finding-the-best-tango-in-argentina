Text: I have a love for dance and was fascinated to travel in South America and discover
  how many varieties of dance there is there! Almost every town and village seems
  to have its own dance and rhyme and often these compliment the local take of the
  national dance - the tango. Covering the wonderful history, personalities and celebrities
  of tango - I will try to cover why this dance is so passionate, mersmerising and
  varied and why it is constantly changing.
