Text: I have an idea for my travel story. It will be inspired by and in my mom, who
  always wants to escape when she feels sad, but she has her work and two daughters.
  So the book tells the story of a woman who does escape from everything, and finds
  herself alone in a country where she only knows how to speak three or four words
  of the national languagge, arabic.
