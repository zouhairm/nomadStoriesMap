Text: "Europe is known for its elegance, charm and beauty. The long solitary walks\
  \ under the blue skies, those pretty little caf\xE9s and a campus life together\
  \ paved a way for my emancipation as a woman. The world and the opportunities were\
  \ infinite but they were undiscovered. The world I inhabited was narrow and confined.\
  \ Meeting new people, travelling and sharing the fleeting moments together transformed\
  \ my whole personality. I suddenly became a definition of cosmopolitan itself. I\
  \ witnessed an immense sense of independence and confidence in my own self. Nothing\
  \ could stop me and I soar high...."
