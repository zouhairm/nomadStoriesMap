Text: 'My story is about the new way to travel. Travelling has now become all about
  hotels,planes and visiting a few memorable  sites.

  It has become more about taking photos to flaunt on social media . The connection
  with the locals is almost non-existent.


  My story focus on how to travel and get more meaningful experience . It talks about
  my own experience. I recently traveled to Moshi in Tanzania and my experience was
  exhilarating to say the least. I learnt a lot about the culture,food and the spirit
  of the Tanzanian people .'
