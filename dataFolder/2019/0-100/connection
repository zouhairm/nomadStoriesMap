Text: First came travel. I went to Spain last year as an exchange student. I then
  spent a semester abroad in Spain,which led to six months of backpacking around Barcelona,
  Madrid and cities around country. Somewhere in there I began writing about my trips.
  I explorer many cities in spain during my stay at spain. which increased my confidence
  as well as my communication skills as I make new friends with every trip to other
  city.
