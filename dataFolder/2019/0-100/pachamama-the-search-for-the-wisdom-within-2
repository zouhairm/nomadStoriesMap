Text: "Journaling 100 days of self love which took me to healers, yoga centres, meditation\
  \ training, going plant based, waste free and finally heading to a shaman in the\
  \ Sacred Valley in Peru. Where in just one week I met life long friends, opened\
  \ my heart, let go of fear and left my past behind me. \n\nIt\u2019s a magical,\
  \ raw and detailed story and story that explains why a piece of my heart will forever\
  \ been left in Peru  \n\n\nThank you"
