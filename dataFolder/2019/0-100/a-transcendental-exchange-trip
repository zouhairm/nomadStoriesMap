Text: he Canada was my first international destination, I enjoyed 1 month in an incredible
  interchange immersion. I went alone, full of fears, spoke little language, but I
  found myself in that wonderful destination. I raided every part of the city of Toronto,
  Niagara, Old Quebec, Montreal and Ottawa. I took every second to make new friends
  and go beyond the commonplace. It was a transcendental experience of freedom that
  I connected with myself and with the universe around me.
