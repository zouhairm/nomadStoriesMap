Text: "My name is Constanza Grillo, 25 years old.\nThere is nothing that I love most\
  \ in the world than learning new things and knowing places with their culture.\n\
  I've been meaning to travel to practice the english I learned in Argentina for a\
  \ long time, I don't have enough money to do it that's why I will love to have the\
  \ experience of enjoying to the fullest a scholarship. \nI'm a Med student, but\
  \ I did studied other things and I work as a Pole Sport and Stretching teacher."
