Text: I did not imagine that a dream of 23 years would have to become a reality, because
  from a simple family where sompre put my dreams on paper and left only on paper
  because I never imagined that it would happen, I always studied in public schools
  I always researched company that sponsored more and always difficult ne, and today
  I come across and realize that reality can happen and a dream that I can happen.
