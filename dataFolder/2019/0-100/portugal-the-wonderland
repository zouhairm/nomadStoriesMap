Text: "My story will include the experiences of my journey from Afghan point of view.\
  \ I will try not only explore the culture, natural beauty, history and lifestyle\
  \ of Portugal but will also cover the western view of the country. I will try to\
  \ go deep into the each aspect of the society and will compare it with the Afghan\
  \ society. I have a unique style of writing and below is the link to my travel story\
  \ about the southern parts of Kyrgyzstan. \n\nhttps://www.fairobserver.com/region/central_south_asia/kyrgyzstan-tourism-travel-culture-news-60019/"
