Text: "I have been all over Europe (except for Portugal), the Caribbean, Central and\
  \ Eastern Europe and Far East Asia. One always want to assimilate the culture and\
  \ the environment. Walk the streets, talk to the people and learn. Taste the food,\
  \ listen to the music and absorb what is happening. \n\nExperience new things day\
  \ to day.  Write about it and try to explain your perceptions."
