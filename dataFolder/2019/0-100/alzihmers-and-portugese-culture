Text: "I didnt expect to find that the majority of those who lived in portugal have\
  \ died of alzihmers. The local fish, cooking with iron and the environmental exposure\
  \ to pollutates; this following the devastation if the first powerpant in 1970.\
  \ I want to explore portugal\u2019s culture and relationship to food and alzihmer\
  \ disease."
