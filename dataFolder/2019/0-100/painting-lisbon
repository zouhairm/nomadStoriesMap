Text: I'm a mexican student for fine arts, and the last year I went to Spain in a
  international movility, I go for six months but I stay there one year because I
  wanted to visit more places, I visited Lisbon one weekend, and I fall in love with
  this wonderful place, Portugal is all magic and beauty, I want to go again and paint
  all the beautiful places from there, I take a lot of pictures and I'm making here
