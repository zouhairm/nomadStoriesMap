Text: "THE OLD SOUL.\n\nMet this women in panchghani,running a restaurant all by her\
  \ own since her husband passed away! \nHow beautiful a woman with such thoughts\
  \ and an active sense of humour at this age could be! \nHer thoughts about \"learning\
  \ to teach somebody\" is nothing new but still rare! \nSuch a pure soul,truly said\
  \ \"OLD IS GOLD\".\nHer aura was something i've never felt before meeting someone\
  \ of 81+\nWho said learning has an age limit. If said, this lady proves it wrong.\
  \ \nGod bless her with health and prosperity!"
