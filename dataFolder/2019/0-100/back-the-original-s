Text: Like all the Brazilians that the grandparents told about their coming to Brazil,
  there are over 500 years of history that expose this connection between us and know
  where it all began in the imagination of all of us, knowing the similarities between
  the nations something far beyond our language so specific and unique by many recognized
  as the most complex in the world. It is believed that there are great similarities
  between Brazil and Portugal culturally and socially. . It pained me deeply to visit
  Europe and not to have had the opportunity to visit my Lusitanos brothers.
