Text: 'I will describe as many moments as possible for the goal of making a whole.  I
  will describe the airplane, funny anecdotes and personalities, colors, textures,
  and tons of food.  All my toys: bluetooth speaker, iPhone6 Plus, laptop, will be
  used to try to stimulate creative out-pout and excitement.  I will prepare to learn
  the language in advance with babel hopefully making things fun.  I will also put
  my experience for crash-landing in new cities (Vancouver little money and found
  a home,  Montreal with my EI found an appartment and job) to the test.'
