Text: Traveling is my interest, and architecture is my passion. And if I talk about
  the architecture of traveling, compared to a developed country, all sorts of wonder
  could occur. Architecture exists everywhere around you. Villages, little towns,
  big cities, states, countries; all of them have known, and or unknown architecture.
  My career in architecture and design teaches me the shape of a building, the structure
  of a building, a story behind the building. But I want to articulate the architecture
  of our five senses towards the lifestyle we live within this existing architecture.
