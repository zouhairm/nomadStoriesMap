Text: "I want to offer a unique space for men to share their untold stories and experiences\
  \ through interviews and photographs.\n\nThe book aims to tell the stories of men\
  \ working in emergency services who connect with emotions, such as sadness, that\
  \ men in our society are often discouraged from expressing \u2013 to the detriment\
  \ of their mental health and our community as a whole.\n\nThe book also aims to\
  \ raise awareness and normalise feelings of sadness, understanding crying as a natural\
  \ behaviour of all human beings."
