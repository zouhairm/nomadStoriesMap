Text: 'Nowadays, even with technology, social networks and Internet; exist a lot of
  desinformation in the world about cultura, places, customs and people.


  Maybe, throughout history we have broken walls, we have built bridges and roads
  between countries; but unfortunately we continue yo create higher walls and barriers
  so strong that they continue yo be passed down for generations. The barriers are
  the most dangerous and in which we can fall so easily.


  These are... Mental barriers'
