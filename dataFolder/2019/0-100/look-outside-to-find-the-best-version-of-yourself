Text: 2017 I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was hospitalized. And then
  my family after few months sent me on my 1st solo trip. And it helped me. I look
  myself when I was let alone in the outside world. I understood who I'm and how I
  wanna lead my life. And in that process of finding myself I'm told I changed a few
  lives. So I don't want that to stop. This is my travel writing story.
