Text: "I am a civil engineer last some time before I go to indo-pak boarder for a\
  \ Construction project with bsf. Before I reached their I think I don't know how\
  \ I stay their and how they react as everyone know that some army officer are strict.\
  \ \nBut when I met them and discuss the project I really never except that they\
  \ will talk to me so much familiar and like they know me very well. \nSo some time\
  \ we think that we can't expect  it but sudden it happen then  I can't describe\
  \ that happen."
