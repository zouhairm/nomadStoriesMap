Text: "You always expect to France to be a romance story, so many movies expectation\
  \ s in your head.\nI went there two years ago and it was really revealing. \nActually\
  \ it's all about a love story. Bit with yourself. \nTake a coffee anywhere, eat\
  \ strawberries in the street, walk by the sena while you're listening a band, \n\
  Was all about learning of French people and how they enjoy of being with themselves,\n\
  That was all the magic and the romance you can find."
