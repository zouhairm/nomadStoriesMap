Text: "I was never a travel person but two years back I started my journey. My recent\
  \ trip was to goa, india. 2500kms to and fro, all alone. Just driving, enjoying\
  \ my own company. It was 7 days trip and it changed my perception to life. Its not\
  \ easy for a solo indian girl to travel to survive but i did and I\u2019m really\
  \ proud of it."
