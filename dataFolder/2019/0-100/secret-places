Text: The story is about a couple that love to travel and discover places where there
  is no tourism. Places where there are natural life and places where there is quiet
  rural life. A couple that like to know the people and their traditions, that like
  to respect and listen the nature. They do not make site plans on the trip. only
  choose a destination and go randomly exploring. There are no arrival and departure
  times. They only spend more time in the places they like and want to explore. Without
  stress, just explore and discover what is still unknown to them.
