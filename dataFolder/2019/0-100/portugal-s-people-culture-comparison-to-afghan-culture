Text: 'Greetings,

  My travel story will be to compare Afghan culture with Portugal''s people culture
  and also to compare Portugal''s people culture with rest of European people.

  I want to deeply have insight view of Portugal''s people culture, religion, values,
  education capacity, industries, success factors, political situation, community
  development, construction developing infrastructure and will compare it with my
  country (Afghanistan). I will release publication about this whole visit, whatever
  I see in my way to Portugal and coming back from Portugal. I will also try my best
  about education opportunity for Afghan in Portugal.


  Regards,'
