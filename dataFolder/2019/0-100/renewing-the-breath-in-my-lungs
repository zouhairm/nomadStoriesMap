Text: I was in San Francisco California and I experienced things there I only seen
  in movies. The idea of seeing and feeling the things I did was emotional to me because
  I never had a chance to experience life when I was younger. I have always believed
  in going big or go home because my dreams are to become an actor and a poet and
  my travel experience led me to write with more passion and purity .
