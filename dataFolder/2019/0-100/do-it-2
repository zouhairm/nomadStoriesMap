Text: Taking challenges in my life is essential, and traveling for me is the greatest,
  because when I say that I want to know a city, town, culture or just for pleasure
  I do it. When I was 19 years old, I took a suitcase and told my parents that I would
  move from town to grow, mature and get to know the world outside of my small town,
  and that is what I am doing living many times with fear, but just do it.
