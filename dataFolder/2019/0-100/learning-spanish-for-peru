  \ book Oh the places you will go to her.  She read one fish two fish red fish blue\
  \ fish to me. She is only 5. So I told her I was very proud of her.   I said I am\
  \ traveling to Peru and trying to learn to speak Spanish.  So grandma is learning\
  \ something new and I hope I can do as good as she is.  \nI am packed and ready\
  \ to go."
