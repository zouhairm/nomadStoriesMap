Text: Two teenage lovers died on Thursday, the result of a failed conspiracy to unite
  their warring families. Romeu Montague and Juliet Capuleto, both from Verona, were
  pronounced dead by what appeared to be self-inflicted dagger wounds. "This is the
  saddest story I've ever heard," said Escalus, Prince of Verona and chief of police.
  "I hope families will learn from this terrible tragedy."
