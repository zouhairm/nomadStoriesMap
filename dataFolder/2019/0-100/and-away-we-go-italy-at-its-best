Text: The moment I stepped off the plane ,I was immediately taken aback by all the
  brilliant colors. And, the people, how beautiful they all were. They were flowing
  through the airport with their cafe and their gorgeous gold jewelry.  I wondered
  in amazement to myself, "hmm,how could I ever look like an Italian..." I guess this
  was Italy at its best...
