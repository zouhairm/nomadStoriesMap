  \ the fact the older she get the less people will believe in her stories. \nSo she\
  \ decide to write a book for the ones that are in the same dimension. \n\nThis book\
  \ is about surrealist artists, a fairy guiding Lucy into all the library books.\n\
  \nThere\u2019s many colors each one represents a feeling. \nSo the fairy helps her\
  \ to go trough every tale \nAnd after all, people who read the book will have fun\
  \ and learn about art."
