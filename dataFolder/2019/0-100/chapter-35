Text: Chapter 35 refers to the age im jumping into as of 2019. Crossing many hurdles
  in life, i had always compromised my travel time and finances for whatever situations
  which were happening around me. The love for travel is always in me. It  always
  awakes a part in me when i travel and now i want to make my first solo travel trip
  to discover myself. To explore The unknown.
