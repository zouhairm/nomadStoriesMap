Text: "I wanted a save life so I enter  Libya by mistake and fear of dead so things\
  \ become worse \nAfter dey sales me to bad people \nThe people was heartless Arab\
  \ dey belt me always  asking me for money and when dey see that I'm half dead dey\
  \ trow me into the sea before two fishermen see me and rescue me to Italian seaship\n\
  By God Grace today I'm life \nEurope I will always love and have u all in my heart"
