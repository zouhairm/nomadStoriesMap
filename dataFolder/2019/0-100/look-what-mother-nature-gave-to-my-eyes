Text: I like to travel alone or with people , doesnt matter ... it depends on where
  the country vibe takes me, i constantly put myslef in situations,  i capture every
  moment, i like it to be a movie cuz this is what is travel about ... to not feel
  like its real , like its happening to you , im amazed by every kind of beauty and
  there s beauty everywhere ... can u imagine
