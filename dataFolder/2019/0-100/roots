Text: "My travel story? Live like no tomorrow. And don\u2019t forget the past cause\
  \ there where we got our roots from. \nSunshine. Faces covered in wrinkles. Not\
  \ an easy life. Listening the heart breaking melancholic fado, slurping wines made\
  \ out of older grapes then your grandfather... watching the sunset and wishing this\
  \ dream will never end. \nNomatter how hard was Portuguese people life- they never\
  \ stopped loving the life. Best lesson we should learn. Behind the deep wrinkles.\
  \ In the roots."
