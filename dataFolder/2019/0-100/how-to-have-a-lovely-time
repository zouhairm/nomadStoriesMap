Text: "Planning ahead has never been my strong point, from booking flights to packing\
  \ my bag it's always been a last minuet dash to the finish line. \n\nAs I stumbled\
  \ off the flight into the stifling heat of the sun the feeling of being totally\
  \ alone crept in. No plans, no where to stay and no transport to get me around.\
  \ \n\n I waited for the bus but it didn't come. I looked for train station but there\
  \ was not one. The great thing about me is that I can have fun where ever I am and\
  \ that's exactly what I did."
