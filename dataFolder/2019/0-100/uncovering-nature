Text: 'One day I with my friend travelled to explore someplace that others have not
  explored yet, we went with our scooter as we knew that according to the geographical
  area there might be some great place running along the river.

  It was monsoon season when we travelled to that place, due to the monsoon that natural
  geographical area was covered with lush green grass all around which made that area
  awesome and a must visit place.


  That point was located on a hill and a water canal running on the side of a hill
  with a stop dam located at another end.'
