Text: Myself, my husband and our one year old, have packed up our home in Australia
  to travel through Europe for a year. Our of my comfort zone completely, with days
  of anxiety so bad I could barely leave the house I have turned a new leaf and said
  why not, life only gives you what you put in and I need more. With a thrill seeking
  husband and adventurist son we started in Spain on this adventure and only have
  plans up until May, then we'll see which country inspires us next.
