  \ and street performing around  Spain the cariney islands and New Zealand and the\
  \ strange situations I found myself in like actually getting into a hippy cult and\
  \ spiked with lsd at 18 or getting picked up by a millionaire in whargi and staying\
  \ with him for a few days and many many more I really want to learn to write properly"
