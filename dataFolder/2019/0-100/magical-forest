Text: I traveled lot in Gujarat ones I was go in random forest and explore it without
  fear lots of new things I had learnt and seen there was deep silince in the forest
  I can Heard my breath there are different types of birds and small animals and then
  I seen magic in my life beautiful waterfall in the forest and the waterfall is calm
  and beautiful and it's like heaven I was soo gald at that time
