Text: After having the opportunity to travel across Europe, parts of Asia and living
  in Australia, a nomad was forced to come to the terms of his dark reality. A diagnosis
  that gave him a second chance at life, but one without the freedom he had grown
  accustomed to. Without the ability to roam as he used to, he felt grounded. This
  is the debris of a nomad.
