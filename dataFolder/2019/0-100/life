Text: "I have never been outside the country, though i always wanted to.\nI love travelling,\
  \ so it will be a life time opportunity. \nI had seen the pictures of Belem Tower,\
  \ when i was young i had the picture at my desktop's background.\nNow i see an opportunity\
  \ to visit and feel the vibes of  that  place over there.\nLastly, but certainly\
  \ not the least\nMy father who passed away almost 4 years back told me once that\n\
  'Do not die before you visit the life other than this place'\ni liked his approach\
  \ and want to visit the world and meet new people."
