Text: I went to Venezuela from Colombia by car on the border we passed by a pick up
  through the farms and the border police followed us because some people were undocumented
  and fortunately we were able to lose them and we hid in a farm for 4 hours and then
  they transported us in another car to Maracaibo evading the controls I was something
  exciting I felt like a fugitive in an unknown country
