Text: "My travel story will be all about meeting new people and discovering what their\
  \ contribution is towards the world, and above all, themselves. If I find a jazz\
  \ musician who performs to spread happiness or cleaners who pay special regard to\
  \ historic monuments and magnificently huge wonders, it will be a trip worth it.\
  \ \nIt's not going to be about typical 'best foods in the country' or 'best places\
  \ to visit'. It will be about people and their stories. How one individual impacts\
  \ others has to make a great tale because they need to be appreciated!"
