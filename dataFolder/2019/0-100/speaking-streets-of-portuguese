Text: 'I have never travelled to any European Country. But every country has their
  own story . the same way I am expecting Portugal would be also having some story.
  so few places I know in Portugal like Lisbon , Faro & Madeira.

  So basically I am a itinerary designer and work for a travel agency in Dubai. I
  have been working for European market for more then 4 Years . I know many things
  About Europe. this will be a golden opportunity for me to put my thoughts and my
  imagination on papers. More I Will explore more I can write.'
