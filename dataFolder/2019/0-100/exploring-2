Text: "As much as I love every one of these destinations, what I love even more is\
  \ the writing. Here, then, are eight travel tales from our Explore column that inspire\
  \ and delight me\u2014I hope they will you, as well. Because it's one thing to travel\
  \ well ... it's another thing entirely to write about it with such clarity, poise,\
  \ and style."
