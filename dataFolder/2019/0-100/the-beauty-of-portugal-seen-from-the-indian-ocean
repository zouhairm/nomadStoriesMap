Text: 'Mozambique being one of the countries colonized by Portugal and its inhabitants
  has interest in hearing story told about the Metropole.

  In fact, my story aims to report the different but common places in Portugal that
  interest Mozambicans from similar areas.

  In my travel history I intend to write about common areas and little prominence
  in the world press.'
