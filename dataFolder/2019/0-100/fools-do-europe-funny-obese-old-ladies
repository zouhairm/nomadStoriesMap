Text: Not your usual travel story.  Two sister travel Central Europe, one on a shoestring
  (using mainly couch surfing and hostels and the other using air b&b and hotels).  We
  meet up each morning and have lots of funny episodes and adventures.  Both unfit
  and in our fifties.  One with the worst sense of direction ever and the other with
  totally illogical thought patterns.  We may have seriously injured each other if
  we had been together 24/7.  As it was we still had some humdinger arguments.
