Text: In Brazil, our connection with Portugal is in the blood. The beginning of our
  journey began on the other side of the Atlantic. We have more affective ties with
  Portuguese culture than we can imagine. To return is to rediscover what remained
  and what made our ancestors cross the seas before never sailed. We will be pioneers
  of the past with an eye on the future.
