Text: "I went on a trip to Portugal in 2013 and it was an amazing trip, I met lots\
  \ of people and made lots of connections. I like the beach and the mountains. When\
  \ I was having my morning coffee in the local market I met a local from Mozambique\
  \ who was very nice company and he told me the history of town and also about Taliban\
  \ in Afghanistan. He was one of the mujahideen who fought against the Russians.\
  \ Then when he came back home he found God \u201CJesus Christ\u201D and he lived\
  \ happily since then."
