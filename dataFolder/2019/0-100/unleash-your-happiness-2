Text: The land of traditions, culture, emotions, huge variety of local taste of street
  food, blessed with many religions unexpected homely feelings. Traveling from North
  to South, East to West using n no of transport in different climate it gives pleasure
  to my travel and encourages me to move on daily, travelling is not moving from one
  place its a journey to find inner peace looking forward how other live in spite
  of having everything or left with nothing. Money can buy things for me but travelling
  is only inner peace to my soul, keep travelling keep inspiring keep smiling.
