Text: Firstly I have been to Hong Kong and guangjao in China. Then I have been to
  India and New Zealand before I have stood abroad in China. I hope travel and touch
  the world by my fingers but I don't know how to make it possible. So today I make
  this letter to you. I really love language. I am learning English Chinese and Japanese
  languages online now.
