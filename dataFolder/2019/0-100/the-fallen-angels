Text: "When the lights dim and the demons arise\nThe city of angels burn you alive\n\
  Walking their way through the walking street\nDying and out playing hunger games\n\
  Their laughter kills the tension around\nLifting the mood and dude above\nTender\
  \ hearts beat their selfless lives\nGoddess' hands are the hands of work.\nWorking\
  \ their way through the twerks.\nTrying their best to close the Shrek.\nDark, brown,\
  \ white or wine\nShe closes her eyes to racism.\nBoy O\u2019 boy, she's that good\n\
  Boy O\u2019 boy, she cries inside\nFaking a smile and wooing you inside."
