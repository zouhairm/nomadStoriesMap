Text: "Would like to write about how beautiful Portugal is from a Goan's point of\
  \ view. \nFor making Goa a little like Portugal due to it's rule back then. Want\
  \ people to explore the little things of Portugal which not everyone knows by reading\
  \ my writing. \nNot just the environment but the people, nature, food, education,\
  \ vacation, street, talent, lifestyle, churches and the connection between Portugal\
  \ and Goa."
