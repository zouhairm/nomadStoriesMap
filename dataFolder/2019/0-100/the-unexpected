Text: Never in my dream, I never knew it exist. My trip to Iceland was amazing. I
  thought theres nothing there to see to enjoy and be amazed but I know nothing..Its
  like going outside the Earth and every turn is just magical and amazing incomparable
  to everything else I have seen. It was my friend's idea to go there that I thought
  I wouldn't enjoy, but boy I was wrong. It was one of the best trip and moment in
  my life.
