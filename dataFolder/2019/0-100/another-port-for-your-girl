Text: "For an average introvert, we fall into the mundane. Wake up, work, eat, tv,\
  \ read, sleep. It's hard to get out of the normal routine especially when you don't\
  \ have the companionship to do so. This is what this travel story is about. A boring\
  \ introvert who\u2019s head is always in a book, breaking out into a world of unknown.\
  \ Learning to break out of the comfort of her shell and experience life in a world\
  \ of unknown."
