Text: "Every year I travel to places to find stories behind each place I\u2019ve visited,\
  \ it\u2019s cultures, it\u2019s people and religions, type of food, music and much\
  \ more...\nMy dream of being a traveler and learn more of what this beautiful world\
  \ has to offer is beyond of what I could\u2019ve ever imagined. \nThis world has\
  \ so much in it, so much to offer, that I wish I could travel more often and let\
  \ people see it and also experience it... Traveling is an interesting hobby for\
  \ me. I get to know so much, live so much, learn and experience."
