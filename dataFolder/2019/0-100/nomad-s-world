Text: Whn nothing seems right, You pack your backs and leave. travelling was never
  about money n never will, all you need is the will to Travel, to dig into unexpected
  to go beyond the boundaries to explore the unexplored. Whn u travel the world gets
  better, it gets better for u, around u, Every trip you take is unspoken pleasure.
