Text: "My story is very least but not last.\nI am Qurat-ul -ain from Pakistan, with\
  \ great authisum and excitement for traveling. To conquere the world.\nTo get communications\
  \ with the locals, experience their culture. \nTo interpret their cost of living,\
  \ education, socialism. \nTo see the beauty of nature, dispersion of nature how\
  \ it beautiful. \nI think traveling is best way to refresh ourself, to relax self\
  \ and start  a new life. \nI am Muslim, I believe that travelling is best way to\
  \ feel better. \nTo get clam internally.... \n I will be very grateful if I got\
  \ this."
