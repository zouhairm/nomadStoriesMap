  Sabang Island is the island where I was born, with a population of approximately
  30000 people. Sabang Island has extraordinary natural beauty, a combination of sea,
  mountain, sky and flora and fauna is a distinctive characteristic of the island.
  Sabang Island has many beautiful places to visit by tourists such as Iboih Beach,
  Rubiah Island, km 0 Indonesia, Jaboi Volcano, Lake Aneuk Laot, Monument I love Sabang
  and many others. Sabang Island also has blue and clear sea, unique coral reefs and
