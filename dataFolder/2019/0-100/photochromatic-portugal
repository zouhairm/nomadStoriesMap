Text: "The streets of Portugal are rich in history and colors. Both intertwined one\
  \ into the other, from the ceramic trade and painted buildings, the cities and countryside\
  \ embraces colour. This translates on the plate, literally, but also in the vast\
  \ array of culinary prowess coming from the country's regions. \nFrom colour named\
  \ (and themed) streets, the country baffles with an impressive pop of vibrancy that\
  \ is unlike anywhere else."
