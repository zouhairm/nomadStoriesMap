Text: Most people I know, when I talked to them about Europe, always fantasize with
  the romantic Paris in France, or the good vibes of Barcelona in Spain, or the wonderful
  people of Amsterdam in Netherlands. Others talk about Germany, United Kingdom but,
  no one seems to know about the greatness of Portugal, with their beautiful and impresive
  beaches and the delicious seafood and culture. Let yourself explore into the beauties
  unknown of this country.
