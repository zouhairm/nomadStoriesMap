Text: Finding new possiblies an unknown city with a group of strangers and meeting
  new people  along the way. You are experiences new things and trying new things
  that you have never done before. You only have a short amount of time on this journey
  becusse it is only for the summer but it hope it last longer than it does. You enjoyed
  the person you where and the things you are doing over the summer and you hope you
  can be that person in everyday life.
