Text: I seen lotsa people, some cows in the street and a bunch of monkeys. There was
  poor people and a few rich people. India has some very rich gods, too. I liked Ganesha
  the best. He's cute. The food was pretty good and I didn't get sick. Crossing the
  street was wild. The peeps was all nice to me, and some even wanted a photo.
