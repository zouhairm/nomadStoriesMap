Text: The day started with a soft nod from the owner of the hotel and we set off.
  The wind blowing in a fragile systematic way which might get vanished like a whisper
  in the midst of crowds. I stood there spell bound coz Wat I have read abt the country
  stood before my eyes in reality. I wonderered whether its a dream or truth. The
  smell of the land after a drizzle made me be with nature. I lost myself with it
  wondering how beautiful mother earth is and how much we have left to see in this
  lifetime
