Text: Kashmir... Heaven on earth. In a true sence it is beyond the truth. To read
  about it in books and to see it in person is different. I saw the heaven  7 years
  back . From the lush green Meadows to sparkling white water to the magnificent himalays
  . A perfect setting to be in a fairyland.
