Text: It was fantastic realising that I was a world nomad. It began when I was young.
  I was originally from a small town in Illinois. I ventured Australia for awhile
  and encountered some wonderful experiences. Since that time I have had the great
  opportunity to travel to many countries. I am a photographer and enjoy writing in
  my free time.
