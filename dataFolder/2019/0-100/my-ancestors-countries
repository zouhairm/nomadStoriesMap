Text: Nobody believes me that i have cape verde's blood, my last name is portuguese
  but my great grand father were from Cape Verde. So it will be an experience, due
  to i havent any clue about my conexions with that culture. I would like to explore
  praia and talk to natives, perhaps i have relatives there. it will a funny experience
  to write about that
