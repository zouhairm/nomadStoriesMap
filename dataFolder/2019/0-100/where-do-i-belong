Text: Growing up in a Western Society (Australia/UK), which is vastly different to
  the cultural, socioeconomic and social ethnic background of the Philippines.  An
  exploration of how learning and better understanding the culture, society/ies, cuisine,
  language/s, socioeconomics and more of the Philippines could have a profound/wholistic
  understanding for those who grow up not of their background culture.  Nature Vs
