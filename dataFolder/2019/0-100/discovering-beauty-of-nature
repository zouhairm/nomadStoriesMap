Text: "I\u2019ve been to France with the love of my life. We found there perfect places\
  \ to expire the unknown and loved every second of it. The world has so much to offer\
  \ and show. The most beautiful thing is that out there is so many different traditions\
  \ and cultures which we are not aware of. The travelling help to experience it and\
  \ understand. Portugal is an amazing country, I wish to be able to go there, this\
  \ time in 3 as we have a beautiful boy in our life now."
