Text: "I was at the cross roads in my life. I needed to go someplace to find my answers.\
  \ I have been writing my story and putting all my memories on a paper before I forget.\
  \ But now we are in the present and I have no clue what the future holds. So I am\
  \ going to Portugal to find out. I don\u2019t want the city hustle I want to find\
  \ a quiet town where I can clear my head and decide what my future will be like.\
  \ I need to choose and I need the right place to do so."
