Text: I was  ending a 6 year relationship and finished my administration degree. I
  was really really lost... so i decided to take a flight to Barcelona and study there.
  At first... i felt awfull, i miss my friends and my family and felt really lonely.
  A few weeks after i started making friends and feeling really secure of myself.
  I planned a trip to portugal with a close friend of mine and it was magic, he ended
  being my boyfriend
