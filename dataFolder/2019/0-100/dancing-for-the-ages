Text: 'Just yesterday, an unexpected invitation to a birthday party, and an opportunity
  to share a special moment.

  She turned 90, supported by family and a cane.

  An introduction, a "salaam" (her hand to my forehead), and she wanted to dance.

  Family was delighted, grandkids, great-grandkids imitating, hands on hips, falling
  down laughing.  Fortunately no broken hips.

  Then sedately back to strawberry cake.

  Thanks for serendipity.'
