Text: When i went to Mato Grosso do Sul,here in Brazil i didn't expect to find a big
  city and such good people living there. Here in Rio we have a stereotipe that the
  people who live there they are some kind of Brazilian Red Necks, and i discovered
  that tehy aren't, and that fact suprised me a lot.
