Text: Chasing Butterflies simply means unraveling all the magical things this trip
  could bring I have never went out of the boarders of South Africa so for me Going
  outside of the country would be chasing Butterflies seemingly because i do not know
  what the opportunity to travel to another Country are like and for me it would honestly
  be a beautiful,magical,mysterious journey to partake in and thus it would be a pleasure
  to be Chosen as a 21 year old from South Africa to make her first travel and document
  all of it and compile a beautiful story.
