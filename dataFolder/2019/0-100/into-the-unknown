Text: 'Manali, perfect place of Living and and the only place where we have to visit
  minimum once a life line and if you want then you lose. The best part of Manali
  is the  sceneries, climate, temperature N last but not the least SNOW!

  A hot Chocolate with a perfect view from the balcony makes it so Beautiful!'
