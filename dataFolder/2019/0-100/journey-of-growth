Text: "It begins with me taking a leap of faith after everything going wrong back\
  \ at home. I move to a new country with no expectations with low low self esteem\
  \ and confidence. \nIt is how I learnt to love to trust and most importantly believe\
  \ in myself even when I couldn't. \nIt is a battle within your self and with your\
  \ self.\nLearning when to let go learning when something is worth fighting.\nMeeting\
  \ those 5 friends you surround your self with ypur lifelines and your adopted family."
