Text: 'You can''t define the words when you got something that you had never expected
  by just an unexpected travelling.

  Once I decided to travel some of the local places nearby me and I started it.

  And there I got love of my life that is everything to me now.

  And now we love to travel together and we spend our remaining time by going to the
  place we met first time.'
