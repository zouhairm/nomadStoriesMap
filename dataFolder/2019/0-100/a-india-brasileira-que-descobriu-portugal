Text: Cabral discovered Brazil in 1500 but upon arriving here he came across innumerable
  indigenous tribes and we were born a fusion of Portuguese and Indians. The Portuguese
  would not have adapted to the climate and pre-existing culture if the Indians had
  not taught them. Five hundred and nineteen years later it was the turn of a Brazilian
  Indian to land in portugal and discover all that portugal has to offer for her.
  Accompany this new discovery by Lusitanian land with the Indian Alessandra.
