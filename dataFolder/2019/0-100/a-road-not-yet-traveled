Text: "When most people travel, the beautiful sights commonly sought out by many,\
  \ are the only parts shown, discussed and glorified. In my travel story however,\
  \ the truth takes priority. \n\nIceland, a beautiful country with beyond exquisite\
  \ sites. Cameras and blogs can never begin to capture the true essence thereof and\
  \ they never even try to capture the \"ugly\" so to speak. Yet how could one value\
  \ the pretty when they don't know the ugly. \n\nMy journal will give a clear backdrop\
  \ of the people and thier culture rather than the scenery. Dig deep into the beliefs\
  \ and virtues of natives."
