Text: Our most memorable vacation was to San Felipe in Mexico. We stayed in a small
  house near the beach. We went up in an ultralight over the Sea of Cortez with a
  man from London. I rode a horse bareback on the beach. I took a yoga class. My husband
  loved their fish tacos. We explored the town of San Felipe. We experienced the karaoke
  night life. I danced, laughed and loved every minute of it. My husband also went
  deep sea fishing and I prayed at a shrine up countless steps to the Virgin Mary.
