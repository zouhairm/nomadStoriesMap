Text: During a recent search into my ancestry I decided to take a leap into the unknown.
  My leap was to Portugal. My first adventure was going to the local library to do
  research about my families past. My next visit would be to the art museum to see
  some of the beautiful art that has been created. I would take a tour through the
  city just to see what life is like in more recent times. I would of course try the
  local cuisine and wine. This would be the adventure of a lifetime.
