Text: In these 14 days, i plan on meeting different different people for me to learn
  Portugese so that i can summarize everything and make it a book for the people to
  learn Portuguese the way i did. The world should also be able to learn the language
  that is here already where we live together (this world). Going to explore Portugal,
  write my each experience i would make when i meet the people, our conversation,
  everything in detail so that it would be like a story book but at the same time
  the reader is going to learn the language.
