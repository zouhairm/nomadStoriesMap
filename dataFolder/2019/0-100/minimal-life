Text: "Living a minimalist life and being minimalist is one of the new life style\
  \ I\u2019m in\nTo show something new it\u2019s not about the price of the camera\
  \ that you hold, it\u2019s about the story that you tell with the minimal of use\
  \ \n\nI\u2019m traveler,  dreamer \nI think everyone see the image from their own\
  \ way"
