Text: I've traveled in some place especially Indonesia, I visited some Wonderful place
  and found a lot of something new that can make me more understood about people,
  culture and natur. Can you imagine? If you find some new place, people, habbit,
  culture and anything it feels like entering fairy tale. Many countries that I haven't
  visit and hopefully can reach one by one and continue to explore.
