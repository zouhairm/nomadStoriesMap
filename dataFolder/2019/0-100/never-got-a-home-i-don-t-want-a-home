Text: My family taught me the meaning of belonging but never gave me a proper home.
  I see people getting lost in material things and their smartphones but I want to
  know if looking at the sky at 7 AM feels different in every country. I don't want
  to feel comfortable anywhere. This inner rash is telling me to leave. I don't know
  where I'll begin but I know in what country I want to end. I want to look at the
  dawn while feeling the irish wind and that way I'll know my life had any meaning
  at all.
