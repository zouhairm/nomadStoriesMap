Text: As I travelled the unknown lands, I look for ways to make connections. Meeting
  up with locals, learning about their culture; I myself am of Portuguese descent;
  connecting with the locals helps me learn about my ancestors and my roots. The locals
  are kind people who were very welcoming, they made me feel right at home. Exploring
  the land helped me make connections with the beauty of the country as well, the
  nature, the climate and the air all connecting back to something that makes Portugal
  so very unique.
