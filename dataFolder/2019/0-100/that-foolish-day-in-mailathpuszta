Text: 'I started this adventure as a youth exchange in a small village in Hungary.

  There were a lake, only two bar and everybody knew each other.

  I was with the italian team, but we were mixed with a lot of nations and there wasn''t
  hate, racism and barriers.

  Everything we worried about was how to have fun the most parteciping in every creative
  workshop and activities that made us feel alive.'
