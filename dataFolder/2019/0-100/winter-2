Text: "Winter\n\nFor long I have pondered \nWhen will winter come?\nThen I start to\
  \ question\nWeather, it dances for some.\nI taste the winter breezes\nBroth of a\
  \ stormy lake\nI got a dog named Nana\nA happy little bake.\nWhere does love come\
  \ from?\nHow did I not know.\nWinter speaks to me\nLike a fairy crow.\nA friend\
  \ I met Called Fafa\nHis heart is just like mine\nLike a little flower\nWho carried\
  \ love behind.\nFor winter is here now\nWith dreams I sing along.\nThis picture\
  \ in my heart\nPainted a favourite song.\n\n17.12.18"
