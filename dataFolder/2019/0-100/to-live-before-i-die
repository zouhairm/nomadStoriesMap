Text: "When you wake up to find yourself pushing 25 not travelled once in your life;\
  \ you see I sudden Instagram post stating free travel! Too predictable, a scam you\
  \ make say or may it seem that this could be it! Travel in my future yes accurately\
  \ but will you give me the chance to go now and then be able to go again once I\
  \ am able to save fully for it and pay for myself! I\u2019ve always wanted to backpack\
  \ around the world! I\u2019d still like to try that!"
