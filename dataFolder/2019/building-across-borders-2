Text: "Being African does not necessarily mean being born here, being African means\
  \ respecting the land and its people. The UJ Africa By Bus tour to Zambia allowed\
  \ for us to situate ourselves within an African context discovering our own conception\
  \ of what being African entails. This tour consisted of sixty students from the\
  \ University of Johannesburg in South Africa travelling for over 40 hours by bus\
  \ to Zambia. \nBeing African means caring about investing in the lives of the inhabitants\
  \ and safeguarding the future of the continent. The adventurous journey we embarked\
  \ on was full of memorable moments which bound us together and created a sense of\
  \ unity. We shared experiences together such as students pushing the bus out of\
  \ soft sand together in the most desolate parts of Botswana, all with the threats\
  \ of nearby lions on the prowl. We all got woken up from a nap by a young lady running\
  \ up and down the aisles of the bus shouting joyfully because she had won chess\
  \ for the first time in her life. We then all celebrated together as she won for\
  \ the second time five minutes later. We got lost together, found together, learned\
  \ together and had our lives changed together. I was privileged enough to be a part\
  \ of this unforgettable experience. \n\nEvery travel experience is unique, unexpected,\
  \ and even though you can prepare every excursion or hotel booking perfectly, every\
  \ travel experience is a chance to discover more about different cultures and your\
  \ place in the universe. It is the possibility of discovering something new that\
  \ fuels the wanderlust that creeps into our hearts from our bellies. It is the eye-opening\
  \ experiences that come with discovering things and people unlike yourself that\
  \ defines an explorer. It is the ability to find similarities in places that you\
  \ have never heard of that makes every leap into the unknown so captivating. As\
  \ a South African, I had the most unexpected experience in a country not too far\
  \ away from mine. \n\nOn a journey to Zambia we encountered our own stereotypes\
  \ about Africa as well as about each other. This experience allowed for stereotypes\
  \ about race, gender, religious affiliation and nationality to be broken down and\
  \ resultantly, people interacted with each other in a way which involved us recognizing\
  \ the inherent humanity first in each other before any form of classification. This\
  \ filtered through to our experience of feeling at home in a different African country\
  \ as we removed the borders from our mind and experienced Africa as our own. It\
  \ was interesting to see how our group\u2019s conversations shifted from general\
  \ commentary about South African politics to how we could be thought leaders and\
  \ influence the African political and socio-economic climate positively. We realised\
  \ that we are in the position to affect change \u2013 we are a group of thinkers,\
  \ lawyers, policy makers, economists, engineers, artists and scientists who are\
  \ equipped to propel the country forward. While it may seem idealistic, it is invaluable\
  \ that UJ Africa by bus tour provided us with this safe, idealistic space where\
  \ we could distance ourselves from a solely South African identity and to develop\
  \ an African consciousness.\n\nI met a student from the University of Zambia who\
  \ said that his biggest dream is to go into any African country and be welcomed\
  \ as its own son, to be greeted as a brother and to feel a sense of belonging. The\
  \ more one travels in Africa, the more one realises the familiarity inherent in\
  \ its towns, cultures and languages. One becomes acquainted with the necessity for\
  \ improving lives of our neighbouring countries inhabitants as well. This is significant\
  \ because we have the opportunity to craft the future we want to craft. One united\
  \ by a common purpose, realising that we cannot rely on any individual or figure\
  \ to redeem us but that we need to work collectively. As the historian at the university\
  \ of Zambia said \u2013 we have to pay rent for being on this earth and the rent\
  \ we need to pay is that of leaving the world in a better state than that in which\
  \ we found it in."
