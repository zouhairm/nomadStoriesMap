Text: "\u2018\u2019Platform 1 for the 23.03 to Lviv\u2019\u2019  the announcement\
  \ floated through the Kiev Passenger Railway Station while \u0131 was sitting and\
  \ searching a place to stay in Lviv. It was a very cold Kiev night and the only\
  \ thought in my head was being alone in my compartment thus \u0131 could clear my\
  \ head. However, it didn\u2019t happen as \u0131 planned.  After \u0131 had placed\
  \ my stuff it was the time for reading a book. There were just 5 minutes left to\
  \ departure so \u0131\u2019d started to think \u0131 am going to be alone but then\
  \ suddenly someone knocked on the door and then it was opened??. Well, after that\
  \ point it wasn\u2019t so hard to guess who came and yes he was my first Ukrainian\
  \ compartment mate.  \u2018\u0414\u043E\u0431\u0440\u043E\u0433\u043E \u0432\u0435\
  \u0447\u043E\u0440\u0430! \u2018 (Dobrovo ve\xE7era), just these two basic words\
  \ waved in the air and he turned to me with a big, friendly smile on his face. I\
  \ should have said something that moment to him for replying, just two basic words\
  \ as he told me, but \u0131 didn\u2019t. I just looked at him with an empty expression\
  \ on my face because \u0131 couldn\u2019t understand what it means so it was the\
  \ time that \u0131 decided to learn basic words of the spoken language the country\
  \ \u0131 visit.\n I said 'Hi!' after got over the first shock and it is not going\
  \ to be wrong \u0131f \u0131 say the time between '...Dobrovo Ve\xE7era' and 'hi'\
  \ lasts so long for me. Fortunately, he knew English and introduced himself to me\
  \ so our life long, at least \u0131 hope it is a life long, friendship has begun.\
  \ \n'Where are you from?\u2019 he asked and this time \u0131 \u0131ntroduced myself\
  \ briefly.  After the meeting stage, we had started to talk about Kiev cause he\
  \ asked me what \u0131 think about it as a stranger, a traveler. Actually, for me,\
  \ it is easy to find something to love in different cultures that \u0131 faced but\
  \ Kiev was different, it was so unique. \nIn Kiev, \u0131 witness the gladness for\
  \ life and also grief for their soldiers. I observe how different cultures, beliefs\
  \ they have but also how united they are under one flag and \u0131 will always respect\
  \ that with all my heart.  Besides, the flow of life-sights, sounds of streets,\
  \ the smell of street foods, coffees have always been tremendous memory in my mind\
  \ and in my heart.  \nI tried to explain my thoughts as best as \u0131 can but \u0131\
  \ felt that words \u0131 used weren't good enough to explain everything, even in\
  \ my native language. \nThis time it was my turn to ask question and \u0131 asked\
  \ him if he can teach me some Ukrainian words. He smiled and accepted it.  Throughout\
  \ the journey, we talked about cultures that we raised in, foods we taste, the places\
  \ we visited and the situation at Russian- Ukrainian border. \nThis is the peanut\
  \ story of how we\u2019ve become friends with Petro and a way to convey my thanks\
  \ to all gentle people who helped me a lot in Ukraine.\nLastly, Dobrovo vo\xE7era\
  \ means good evening, if you wonder"
