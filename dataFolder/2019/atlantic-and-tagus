Text: "Lisbon is a wonderfully wounded city. It doesn\u2019t celebrate love as Paris\
  \ or even the ethernity as Rome. It proudly celebrates instead  the defeat and the\
  \ disillusionment, conscious  of its recent ghosts  in Africa.\n\nI remember how\
  \ my ''saudade'' was born, when my adolescent loneliness used to meet me on time\
  \ at 10.30 pm, walking with me along the Rua Augusta. During those nights  the Nature\
  \ was the triumphant  taking back all the space that humans  alienated : the cold\
  \ breezes violently used to penetrate the arch , straight to conquer all the  Rua\
  \ Augusta and leaving their soft salt on my lips that i sweeten with a crushed Pastel\
  \ de nata saved in my bag . All the space turned into an ancient  silence broken\
  \ by an hymn of seagulls. Not far, the Nature still played in its war  mixing harmoniously\
  \ the clear atlantic waves with the brown ones of Tagus river, as well as a drunk\
  \ creole homeless desecreted that union of water mixing some of his red wine waves\
  \  with the clear waves of his hopes . \nAfrica and Europe were again sitted in\
  \ front of the same Atlantic sea, in the same destiny.\n\nIn Lisbon, however, it\u2019\
  s easy to kill your one-night demons: you can drown them in the Alcohol of  Ginjinha\
  \ as into the loud of the Feira Da Ladra Market . One day i choose this last  option\
  \ because it\u2019s in the market where the young past finds its first emancipation\
  \ . The ''Robber\u2019s market'', with its nostalgic references to that lost colonial\
  \ world , was a triumph of dusty memories . Under the ''Pante\xE3o'' there was and\
  \ old woman with a pimp smile who looked like a character from the Merchant of Venice.\
  \ She was leading my attention to its War souvenirs and, in particular ,to  one\
  \ postcard dated \u201C Maputo 1974\u201D, signed by a soldier and had to be sent\
  \ to \u201CEvita R. Alvares\u201D from Barreiro.  \n\n  \u201CThere\u2019s no flower\
  \ that i can send you, but this thought. I\u2019m fine. Saudade.\u201D\n\n That\
  \ final word, under that hostile  patina , so intentionally brutally separated ,\
  \ made  me remind of a waiting veiled by a light melancholy and hope as i always\
  \ sensed in that drunk creole by the sea.\n\n\u201CFor having being finished here\u201D\
  - i said to that  Merchant of Lisbon - \u201C this letter has never arrived. Isn\u2019\
  t true?\u201D She closed the right eye to approve, opening the left hand for money.\
  \ \nHow many cemeteries and monuments  exist -i thought- for the ones who fell \
  \ but  not even a place for all those written words  dead before to be sent from\
  \ that Africa ''without flowers'', replaced by blood and powder.\n I felt in that\
  \ moment the historical duty to bring that postcard as if it was a baby who never\
  \ found his parents. The day later,  i toke the \u201C10.30\u201D ferry to Barreiro\
  \ from Terreiro do Pa\xE7o, 2 mins far from  my square of usual night saudade .\
  \ After 40 mins Barreiro welcomed me with its stunning decay: it looked like the\
  \ forgotten Lisbon\u2019s sister, with her grey messy hairs and frumpy vibes, proud\
  \ to show her wrinkles.\n\nThe progress just had scarred that place with some grey\
  \ blocks behind the ancient mills.The washing lines wave as those flags that someone\
  \ would plant on the furthest Island to say \u201Cthere\u2019s life\u201C\n\nI was\
  \ looking for Evita between  some ruined houses still standing for a miracle when\
  \ i felt as in another continent seeing the typical green and blue walls and the\
  \ smell of bread from the always open doors. As it\u2019s usual in the small villages\
  \ in Portugal i asked  the oldest man how to find Evita. He was stuffed  in the\
  \  sunlight looking proudly at his nephews who were collecting - bent over as in\
  \ a rite- sea worms to fish. He pointed with his toothless portuguese one house\
  \ not so far. Once I was there, just outside the door there was an old rude woman,\
  \  hidden by loads of grey hairs ,  arranging her clothes . So, with a breath for\
  \ my courage and another for my voice i  said tactlessly \u201C Senhora Evita? \u201C\
  \  showing her the postcard. \nShe looked at me bothered, making her eyebrowns wave\
  \ as the Atlantic and her lips as the Tagus.\n\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D"
