Text: "It was January 2nd, 2016, somewhere between the Virginia state line and Dollywood,\
  \ TN in the dead of night. I was driving back to Nashville, bound the next day for\
  \ Orlando, FL to work a week-long conference. Staring out at the highway, the lights\
  \ twinkled at me while the radio serenaded to the rhythm of the road, and my travel\
  \ companion, Mina, was asleep in the passenger seat. As I navigated past the last\
  \ exit sign for the next several miles, reality occurred that I was on my way back\
  \ to a life that I had lost interest in. \n\nMy routine of fourteen hour work days\
  \ - event coordinator by day, brand ambassador by night \u2013 had been exhausting\
  \ me. I was chasing after something - a career, happiness, prosperity, pride - and\
  \ I did it the way I knew best \u2013 pouring my everything into a fabricated notion\
  \ that I was promised since childhood. Follow a pattern and get all you desire.\
  \ \n\nYet somehow, this concept I had been practicing wasn't working out. It was\
  \ time to move on and find a fresh start in a new city. Afraid to feel trapped or\
  \ stuck in one place, I started musing about where in the States I hadn't been,\
  \ and began to route a 60 day long circular tour around the country, with my final\
  \ destination being my new home. \n\nAfter an hour of brainstorming, it was time\
  \ to swap driving duties with Mina. The car took off again, and I excitedly began\
  \ writing down my tour route and mapping the logistics of my master plan. Curious\
  \ about what I was doing, Mina looked over and saw my inspired face, and asked what\
  \ I was up to. I pitched him my idea, asked his opinion of it, and if he might have\
  \ an interest in being my companion. He thought there was some potential to consider.\
  \ \n\nWe arrived back in Nashville in time for me to grab my suitcase, have a coffee,\
  \ and depart for the airport. The night before I flew home, Mina asked if he could\
  \ see me when I returned for dinner. Over a cigarette and a glass of wine on the\
  \ balcony, he brought up my travel idea, but with a twist. \u201CWhat about thinking\
  \ bigger\u201D? So I asked him to elaborate. \n\nMina was a traveller, and I was\
  \ hooked on the stories from his recent time spent backpacking through twenty six\
  \ European countries. Since we met, he planned to move overseas and experience a\
  \ different lifestyle. He had casually proposed the idea of traveling together overseas\
  \ and seeing what might happen. Before he began to elaborate on my plan, I had a\
  \ feeling that something big was about to present itself. And I was right \u2013\
  \ Mina was ready to move on, and he asked me to join him in relocating to Europe\
  \ and starting a new life together. \n\nIt took but a minute for me to resolutely\
  \ say, \u201Cyes\u201D. I had never been so sure of anything, and for the first\
  \ time in my adult life, I had no plan and no expectations, just sheer determination\
  \ to get where I was going. Over the course of the next six weeks, housing leases\
  \ were broken, cars were sold, material possessions were sold off in a yard sale,\
  \ and one-way tickets were purchased. All we knew was our starting destination,\
  \ Copenhagen, and nothing more. Mina did not believe in planning, he took each day\
  \ as it came, and that was exactly what we would do. It was time to live out of\
  \ a backpack, immerse ourselves in new cultures, and see how long we could last\
  \ on the road. \n\nDeparture day finally arrived, and as I walked through the airport\
  \ and boarded my aluminum chariot, all I could do was look forward, never once back.\
  \ As the plane raced down the runway and the wheels left the earth, I felt as though\
  \ the biggest weight had been lifted off of my shoulders as I soared into the unknown.\
  \ This leap would be unlike anything I had ever done, and the journey has been continuing\
  \ since that departure day three years ago."
