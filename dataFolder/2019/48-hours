Text: "My travel life started since I was a kid and my professional career helped\
  \ in marking my journey. I remember how it happened unexpectedly when I was the\
  \ only person who got selected with Qatar Airways and represented India in 120 Nationalities\
  \ for the final round of interview during my batch. \nIt was 2013 Jan, when I stepped\
  \ in (the capital of Qatar) Doha, Qatar and felt goosebumps all over my body as\
  \ it was my very first time to visit out of India for official purpose. All the\
  \ people in my batch were accomodated in a Traveller's Van, where the Driver kept\
  \ guiding us throughout and kept showing the famous buildings and places. Looking\
  \ around actually made my more excited and curious to stamp a new country in my\
  \ mind \nIt was altogether a very different experience for me, where I was in a\
  \ new counrty, actually an unknown one, new people around. I suppose I was the only\
  \ person who knew the least of the local language spoken there. The beauty of the\
  \ place for me started from right outside the Airport. The streets were as beautiful\
  \ as the ceilings we have in the ethnic caf\xE9s these days. I stayed in Hotel Oryx\
  \ Rotana, which was in the centre of the market. When I looked outside my window,\
  \ I saw an extreme level of lightening on the streets, like I always used to imagine,\
  \ looking outside my window. \nAfter the interview process, we all were done for\
  \ the day; being friendly (because of my obvious nature) I made few great friends\
  \ named Divine from USA, Faraz from Pakistan, Palomi from Bangladesh, Vangjush from\
  \ Israel and few other from Bulgaria, France, etc. I decided to spend my rest of\
  \ the day exploring this strange, new and beautiful place because I never wanted\
  \ to loose onto the opportunity of joting down the place and it's experiences in\
  \ my travel memory.\nWell I had some money left, so I decided to eat vegetarian\
  \ food, for which I had to search an Indian Restaurant. It was perfect timing when\
  \ it started raining slightly, I could feel the droplets on my cheeks  and that\
  \ actually increased my hunger; all I wanted was to be full before I get wet. Finally\
  \ walking for about 25-30 minutes, I found one where there was a nice North-Eastern\
  \ Indian Woman sitting on the counter and when I told her that I was an Indian citizen\
  \ and it was my first time in Doha, she was overwhelmed, she suggested one the best\
  \ speciality of her restaurant - Veg Biryani with veg Raita. The food was amazingly\
  \ cooked and I could smell it from a distance while it  was about to reach my table.\
  \ \nAfter I had my dinner, I tried exploring the street shops and snacks corner\
  \ and there were many. I walked down all on my own, saw different chilling hubs\
  \ like Doha Rocks, MacD. Also there were branded showrooms which had amazing collection\
  \ and weren't very much expensive. I interacted with local people out there and\
  \ asked about the best places to hangout.\nAfter I was heading to the hotel, I came\
  \ across a great car showroom which had different amazingly designed cars and the\
  \ best part was that the brand's of the cars were world famous (like Ferrari, Lamborghini\
  \ - well now I know few brands) but for me they were cars only. Still the owner\
  \ of the showroom was welcoming and he insisted I remember a family who was walking\
  \ by my side, since I was alone and I had a camera so I asked them if anybody could\
  \ click few pictures of mine as I had to keep some memories of visiting Doha. I\
  \ got a lot of memories rolled down my camera's SD Card.\nI was happy to explore\
  \ most of Doha's beautiful sigtings in a span of 4-5 hours. When I was heading back\
  \ to the Airport, I suddenly looked outside the window and and realised \"Wow! What\
  \ an amazing experience I just had\". It went amazing not only because I travelled\
  \ all the way because of the city (Doha) took me in her arms and made me feel home,\
  \ away from home."
