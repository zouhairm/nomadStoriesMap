Text: "I grew up watching I love Lucy, which in turn made me infatuated with Cuba.\
  \ I wasn't aware that Americans couldn't travel there till I was a teenager. As\
  \ soon as I got the heads up Americans could travel freely, I booked a flight to\
  \ Havana for New Years Eve. I knew it would be a magical trip, but could have never\
  \ imagined what was in store for us. \n\nMy friends and I, all flying from different\
  \ places, easily found one another because the airport is so tiny. We exchanged\
  \ enough money to get us to the hotel with some change. My friend had been told\
  \ there was some black market bank and to go there to get the best exchange rate.\
  \ I would suggest just doing it all at the airport. It ended up being the best deal.\
  \ Once we got to the hotel we did have some confusion about our room because we\
  \ had one more guest than they thought. We couldn't understand why it mattered,\
  \ but when we got to our room we were dying laughing. They shoved three full bed\
  \ all side by side for us. I guess everyone must get there on bed like the actual\
  \ I Love Lucy Show. \n\nMy friend was determined to find this black market bank.\
  \ We asked some people no one knew what we were talking about. Then this guy took\
  \ us on a goose chase. It felt like we were doing something illegal. We wound up\
  \ as some guys apartment, who exchanged our money. He also sold cigars, so my friends\
  \ bought some. This was one thing we looked back in laugh, but I wouldn't recommend\
  \ doing this. It took way longer than just doing it at an airport. \n\nThat night\
  \ we took it easy and walk the streets because there is so much to see and take\
  \ in. Music is playing everywhere. You can order mojijtos to go. We noticed a lot\
  \ of places were closed for New Years eve, so we ended up popping into this one\
  \ restaurant with a balcony. When we got upstairs we realized it was also in someone's\
  \ apartment. This will happen a lot in Cuba, it's normal and it's an experience.\
  \ We even saw where you string money up to a lady in fifth floor apartment and she\
  \ strings you back down pizza. \n\nYou're constantly stimulated with color, architect,\
  \ culture and cars. Take it all in. We visited some hole in-the-wall art studios\
  \ with the most amazing pieces. The next time I go back, I want to get more art\
  \ for sure. I have lived in New York City for a long time and you'd think I've seen\
  \ some of the most amazing jazz and art museums, but Havana knocked everything out\
  \ of the park. The coolest museum I've ever been to is called Fabrica De Arte. It\
  \ has many different rooms with different themes, including rooftops and backyard.\
  \ There was also a bar in almost every room and some had live bands, or djs as well\
  \ as art of course. The one weird thing about Cuba is the toilet paper. The bathroom\
  \ attendee will hand you two or three squares and that's all you get. \n\nOne of\
  \ my favorite things we did was pay a driver in a convertible to take us to the\
  \ beach which was about two hours away. The beach was honestly one of the most beautiful\
  \ beaches I have ever been too. It had the clearest water. I would have stayed in\
  \ the oceans for hours, but I had to come back to get my fresh coconut with rum\
  \ in it. The guy takes the coconut from the tree, pops a whole in it, and gives\
  \ you the rum to pour in as much as you'd like. Something about the rum in Cuba\
  \ is special. No hangovers, tastes amazing, and never too drunk. \n\nOur last night\
  \ we went to a jazz club. It was one of the best shows I've ever seen live. It was\
  \ smooth and remixed for a lack of better term. It was modern and something I'd\
  \ listen to. I can not wait to go back and explore more of what Cuba has."
