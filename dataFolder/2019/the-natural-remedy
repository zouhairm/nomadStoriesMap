Text: "I haven't been happy lately, so I told myself \"let's go for a long walk in\
  \ the hills\". I picked up my bag, left my responsibilities and thought I'll find\
  \ my happiness at the top. \nThe funny thing is while I was walking amidst the trees,\
  \ I forgot all the problems and pain. The sound of the water hitting the stones,\
  \ the rain and sun competing for their presence, and it was completely devoid of\
  \ machines churning and engines burning. No electronic message could save me from\
  \ nature's tranquilizer, but I didn't want to be saved. Just this once, I didn't\
  \ mind freely falling into the pure air. \nWhen I reached the top, I thought it'd\
  \ be instantaneous. The happiness. But I realized something, happiness isn't something\
  \ we achieve only once. We achieve it through doses. Happiness isn't the biggest\
  \ picture of life. \nEverything is. \nAnd nature gave me one promise. It'll always\
  \ be there whenever I need to runaway. But it'll always teach me to go back to the\
  \ concrete world. \nThat's just how life is. You go in search of one thing, but\
  \ you find something much more vital and meaningful. \nSo for as long as you can,\
  \ you should travel until you find your story in the sounds of the gushing water\
  \ and rustling leaves."
