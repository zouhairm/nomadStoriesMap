Text: "We are driven down the winding Waimangu Volcanic Valley in a rickety bus. The\
  \ heavy rainfall from last weekend has flooded out half the walking track to the\
  \ lake, so temporary transport is required to ferry the tourists through 'stage\
  \ two' of the valley. A spitting geyser erupts to the left; on the right, boiling\
  \ water rushes by at an unimaginable speed. The air smells pungent, like boiled\
  \ eggs that have been left to rot. The sticky steam billows in the wind, shrinking\
  \ down around us like dissolving candyfloss. I wish my glasses had automatic windshield\
  \ wipers.\n\nThe driver is a happy-go-lucky man in his 60s. My mother is expert\
  \ at talking to strangers, so we soon know the abridged autobiography of his life\
  \ \u2013 where he was born (Ahipara), where his family moved to (Kerikeri, then\
  \ \u2018down south\u2019), what he has been doing for the last forty years (travelling\
  \ publishing salesman in Vietnam). He tells us he has returned to New Zealand for\
  \ the next five years so he can claim his pension. \n\nHe turns us sharply round\
  \ a steep corner and my mum grips the edge of her seat. She eyes the bubbling stream\
  \ down below. \u2018Don\u2019t you ever feel nervous working here?\u2019\n\nHe laughs\
  \ loudly. \u2018If I was nervous, I wouldn\u2019t live in New Zealand!\u2019\n\n\
  In many ways, he\u2019s right. New Zealand is not a country for the faint-hearted.\
  \ Lying within the Pacific Ring of Fire, our country is one that has experienced\
  \ the threat and horror of shifting ground and volcanic explosions over centuries\
  \ and millennia. In recent years, the devastating Christchurch, Kaik\u014Dura and\
  \ Seddon earthquakes come to mind, but the massive 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera\
  \ is considered \u2018recent\u2019 in geological time. \n\nIn retrospect, there\
  \ is no better time to muse on the possibility of a volcano destroying half of New\
  \ Zealand than when you are deliberately walking into a live volcanic valley. My\
  \ anxiety rising by a few degrees, we entered \u2018stage three\u2019. I couldn't\
  \ help but walk with half a mind \u2013 one half on the physical beauty of such\
  \ an ethereal place, and the other half imagining its violent history. \n\nThe volcanic\
  \ valley ends at Lake Rotomahana. The \u2018eighth wonder of the world\u2019, the\
  \ awe-inspiring Pink and White Terraces, used to live here. Wealthy tourists flocked\
  \ to Te Wairoa, where they would be taken across Lake Tarawera in waka and whaleboats,\
  \ by foot over the Kaiwaka Channel and then trek over the hill to Lake Rotomahana.\
  \ It was a long and difficult trip, but one soon forgotten when faced with the beauty\
  \ of the terraced pink-and-white silicia hot pools. \n \nOn 10 June 1886, violent\
  \ earthquakes woke locals and tourists early in the morning. Outside, the sky was\
  \ lit: burnt orange and mustard yellow. Mount Tarawera split open and a huge column\
  \ of fire could be seen shooting up into the air. Molten rocks, burning mud and\
  \ immense clouds of black ash smothered the scene. \n\nIt is estimated that 153\
  \ people were killed that night. The entire villages of Te Ariki and Moura were\
  \ buried completely under volcanic mud, with no survivors recorded. The Pink and\
  \ White Terraces were destroyed, the scattered remnants lying deep beneath Lake\
  \ Rotomahana. \n\n132 years later, I take photos of the picturesque black swans\
  \ gliding across the silent lake. I suitably gasp in awe at the huge geysers and\
  \ admire the wall of steam billowing out from the cliffs. \n\nFor me, anxiety is\
  \ a sister to silence. In quiet moments, it can be easy to fall into the whirlpool\
  \ trap of anxious thoughts. At Lake Rotomahana, I found something I didn\u2019t\
  \ expect: the silence drowned out any anxiety. The absolute beauty made me feel\
  \ at peace.  \n\nThe bus driver took us back up the winding valley. He gave us a\
  \ pamphlet on the local hot pools, urging us to try them out. On the way up, we\
  \ came across two tourists \u2013 Australian \u2013 who had failed to read the signs\
  \ that the 'stage two' walking track was closed for access. Although our driver\
  \ had earlier reassured my mother, he hastened to tell the tourists off. 'Don\u2019\
  t you read? Don't you know that this is a live volcanic valley? It\u2019s dangerous!'"
