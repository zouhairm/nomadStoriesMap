Text: "The Killings Fields in Phnom Penh was one of the most moving experiences I've\
  \ had, but at the same time, it was also horrifying, depressing, shocking and many\
  \ other adjectives that I still can't find several years later.\n\nThe mass genocide\
  \ in Cambodia, in my experience, was not mentioned in my history classes, yet is\
  \ something that should be taught along with the Holocaust and countless other genocides\
  \ in history. The Khmer Rouge killed approximately 20-40% of the entire Cambodian\
  \ population in just four years. The estimates range from about 1.8 million to 3.5\
  \ million people out of a population of 8 million people. They will never know the\
  \ exact number since the majority of people were buried in mass graves. At the end\
  \ of each monsoon season, the bones of victims of the genocide are brought up to\
  \ the surface of the earth and gathered to be added to the memorial currently located\
  \ at the Killing Fields. The genocide took place between 1975 and 1979, yet prosecution\
  \ of the individuals involved didn't begin until almost thirty years later, in 2006.\
  \ \n\nWalking through the Killing Fields was a time of deep reflection. I passed\
  \ by signs describing horrific atrocities directed towards the people of Cambodia,\
  \ describing the beating of children against trees so they could not seek avenge\
  \ their parents in adulthood. One small building was labeled as a \u201CChemical\
  \ Substances Storage Room.\u201D When you examine the information more closely,\
  \ you learn it is where the chemicals, such as DDT, were kept which they would pour\
  \ over dead bodies to eliminate the odor but also to ensure that anyone who was\
  \ buried alive would be killed. \n\nIt is impossible to walk through the fields\
  \ without imagining the unspeakable evils experienced by the people in the fields.\
  \ There were so many stories lost which we can never know. The bodies cannot be\
  \ identified. There were too many bodies buried headless or in mass graves, and\
  \ too much damage for people to be able to find the fates of their family and friends\
  \ in those fields. Entire families disappeared and we will never know. And this\
  \ was just one of many fields in Cambodia. It is absolutely heartbreaking. \n\n\
  Yet, life continues in Phnom Penh. During my time there, almost every person I met\
  \ above a certain age had lost loved ones in the Killing Fields, their stories related\
  \ as a matter of fact, as though it was an everyday occurrence, because for them,\
  \ it was. It's amazing that the country survived. Visiting those fields, you can\
  \ sense that life goes on in Cambodia, because it must. Just beyond the fence, rice\
  \ fields and livestock show evidence of the life continuing, yet the poverty of\
  \ the country reflects a difficult past. This is one of those places where it seems\
  \ like tourists shouldn't be allowed. But at the same time, it's important to visit\
  \ those places. To remember the people who died. To remember that these events have\
  \ happened in recent history and are still happening today."
