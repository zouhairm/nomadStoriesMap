Text: "Hardly twenty miles north of the city of Xanthi in Western Thrace, and we could\
  \ feel the presence of the Green Man of Greece, Dionysus. Turn after (hairpin) turn,\
  \ our old Peugeot car moved up the narrow mountain road in the pitch dark. I was\
  \ in the back seat, feeling strangely excited. My window was rolled down and I could\
  \ discern the outlines of the forested mountains and the terraced slopes, where\
  \ tobacco is grown, near the Pomak settlements. \n\nWe left local Xanthi bar \u2018\
  Dommage\u2019 just before midnight, equipped with nothing but a few hearty meat\
  \ sandwiches seasoned with a generous dose of boukovo, the spicy flake powder made\
  \ from \u2018tsuska\u2019 red peppers. The trip was decided on the spot. I was a\
  \ first-timer, but my two friends have long been regulars at the Thermes mineral\
  \ springs, especially in the summer nights, when there is no better recompense for\
  \ heat tiredness and fatigue, than the cool, invigorating mountain breeze. \n\n\
  The mineral-rich water of the hot springs in the village of Thermes, where we were\
  \ headed, is said to have healing properties, but there is more to it than that.\
  \  Thermes, a group of villages near the Bulgarian frontier, is inhabited exclusively\
  \ by Pomaks, the Bulgarian-speaking Muslims, who are in essence native highlanders.\
  \ \n\nFrom 1936 to 1995, Pomaks in Western Thrace lived under a curfew in a military\
  \ restricted zone. Their identity has been a bone of contention for a long time,\
  \ but ttoday Pomaks simply identify as \u2018natives\u2019or \u2018locals\u2019\
  . Thermes is the perfect place to mingle with this formerly-secluded people \u2013\
  \ and share a hot bath.\n\nAs soon as we reached our destination, we tried our luck\
  \ in an open log cabin by the roadside. My friend Lakis stripped himself naked and\
  \ very slowly immersed in the water, its temperature ranging from 38\xB0 C to 53\xB0\
  \ C. I joked about our friend\u2019s guru qualities \u201CWell, that should sober\
  \ you up\u201D,but only managed to dip my feet in the water for a prodigious thirty\
  \ seconds. \n\nOur next stop was the well-kept hamam overlooking the valley a little\
  \ further down the road. The bath is for both men and women and the water temperature\
  \ felt quite comfortable, although not from the very start. Once in the water, we\
  \ got acquainted with our fellow bathers. Eva and Demokritus left civilisation behind\
  \ to live in the mountain of Livaditis at an altitude of 1.355 meters . Lovers of\
  \ nature and the rural way of life, they run a small-scale organic farm and rear\
  \ horses. Ahmet is one of many Pomak men, who left their village to find work in\
  \ Germany. After studying music in Sofia, Gerasimos, the clarinetist, rejoined his\
  \ hometown Xanthi, where he works at local factory. \n\nWe soaked in the warm water,\
  \ for what seemed like forever, listening to one another with interest. We all agreed\
  \ that when people live in harmony with nature, they live in harmony with one another,\
  \ irrespective of their ethnic or religious background. This is the simple secret\
  \ of peaceful, communal living.  To our mind, that was what this little corner of\
  \ the world was about \u2013 connection, sharing, learning from each other. The\
  \ very essence of our humanity is deeply lodged into the natural world.\n\nLater,\
  \ we shook hands with our new friends, wolfed down our meal and got ready to leave.\
  \ Alas, our car plunged into a ditch and we spent the next couple of hours trying\
  \ to pull it out. I went into the village square several times to fill our bottles\
  \ with wild spring water, as we were dying of thirst after our spicy meal. There\
  \ was no cell phone signal in this remote area, so all we could do was wait.\n\n\
  At daybreak, my friends went to the village to ask for help. The mayor himself \u2013\
  \ I think his name was Hassan \u2013 came to give us a hand. He was quite a sight\
  \ in his impeccable white linen suit and brown loafers, bathed in the soft light\
  \ of dawn. \n\nWe thanked him dearly and promised to come back for another body\
  \ and soul-restoring soak. \u201CAnd community bonding\u201D. Hassan waved goodbye\
  \ to us, smiling."
