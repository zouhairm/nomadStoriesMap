Text: "Storytelling is the art of perfect synchronization of the best of memories\
  \ with a dash of imagination. But what do you call those smithereens of memories\
  \ which are as beautiful as a fairy tale and have no amalgamation of imagination?\
  \ One such incident from my diary is that of a starry night on one of the beaches\
  \ of Gokarna. \nQuite often I find myself talking to the sea, but that was the longest\
  \ and the best conversation we had. It was a December night and the cold breeze\
  \ seemed to flutter with my thoughts. Everything around seemed magical and as I\
  \ looked to my left and right, I could only see the never-ending stretch of the\
  \ beach being washed away by the white sea waves. I felt like I was sitting on my\
  \ private beach as there was no other human being around. That was the night I fell\
  \ in love with Gokarna - for the third time. I got lost in the peace and the serenity\
  \ so deep that I was not sure if that was just an imagination. To my company was\
  \ a very protective dog who sat next to me till the last minute. The shacks around\
  \ had closed and the only source of light were the glittering stars, the moon and\
  \ the reflection on the sea waves. With the passing number of hours, the starts\
  \ started fading away and the black of the sky got domineered by a red hue. The\
  \ water was still reflecting but this time, the refection was that of the rising\
  \ sun. Gradually people from the shacks came out with their yoga mats, and it was\
  \ a completely different picture altogether. It was still beautiful. \nAround three\
  \ years back from that night, during my first visit to Gokarna, as I sat by the\
  \ beach in Kudle, I sensed my first encounter with love. Sitting on the white sand\
  \ for hours, unraveling the tumults of my daily life and trying to capture the beauty\
  \ in my mind, unknowingly, I had built a connection with the place. Running around\
  \ the empty moonlit beach at night, speaking my heart out to the sea, witnessing\
  \ the sun gradually disappear in the sea is what actually defines freedom for me.\n\
  I had to revisit the place. I was back to Gokarna within a year and nothing had\
  \ changed. But I could feel the connection that I had already developed with the\
  \ place. I felt comfortable there. The best part of my second trip was that I made\
  \ a few friends from different parts of the world over a bonfire on the beach. The\
  \ bonfire went on till the sun took over, as we sang and shared our stories with\
  \ each other. And I fell in love with the place a little more. And this was when\
  \ I made a promise to the beaches of Gokarna that I will visit that place at least\
  \ once every year.\nMy third trip was the best out of the four as I explored the\
  \ most, trekking from Kudle to Om to Half Moon. It was a day trek, but pretty arduous.\
  \ Without opting for a guild, we wanted to deliberately get lost in the trails,\
  \ soak in the serenity and be a part of it. The perilous trek through steep rocks,\
  \ sometimes with barely any space to place our feet and the roaring sea right below\
  \ it, came to an end at the dusk. We reached a small beach covered by thick woods\
  \ on all three sides and a clear view of the horizon on the other side. With no\
  \ source of electricity, candles and sea-breeze were the only luxuries we could\
  \ demand. I realized that I had missed a beautiful part of Gokarna in my last two\
  \ visits. As I sat on a rock to see the sunset on the horizon, it seemed like one\
  \ of the biggest achievements of my life. \nAnd yet another promise made."
