Text: "A few months back, I ventured into southwest China. The initial thought was\
  \ a little daunting as I had not engaged myself with any English guided group or\
  \ tour. Exploring the rural province was definitely going to be a challenge but\
  \ I had always reminded myself that through the journey comes its own reward - and\
  \ with the first morning light, I was embraced by the hues of a hilly countryside,\
  \ scattered across grassy plains beneath a vast horizon of white and blue. This\
  \ is the last hidden world. An entry point to the beginning of a remote terrain,\
  \ filled with breathtaking landscapes and surprising ethnic practices that traced\
  \ thousands of years back. \n\nI felt small. I felt out of touch. Coupled with the\
  \ mindset of an overachieving youth coming from a metropolitan city, I was confident\
  \ that I had most of the knowledge needed to survive this expedition into the wild\
  \ southwest. I wasn\u2019t wrong, but neither was I close to being right. My whole\
  \ journey was a bittersweet struggle. I was cornered by the many limitations and\
  \ unfortunate series of events that befell me. Despite all the setbacks, I was soon\
  \ comforted by the warm welcome rendered upon my arrival. As I set foot onto this\
  \ little town of colourful tribal cultures and religious minorities, I knew that\
  \ I\u2019ve made it into Eastern Pandora. \n\nAs we all know, chinese civilisation\
  \ has always been known to be one of the worlds oldest. It was definitely an eye-opening\
  \ experience - to be able to witness ancient customs still being practiced by the\
  \ people living in the remote highlands of Shangri-la. Every moment there felt like\
  \ the unraveling of a time capsule. A place where man and nature, live in close\
  \ partnership with each other. Non existent is the residue of modernisation. \n\n\
  This small county is situated at an elevation of 10,370 ft, around its quarters\
  \ exist the majestic Himalayan. As I attempted to explore the area further, days\
  \ in, my body caved. I fell victim to the high altitude - migraine, nausea, and\
  \ multiple nosebleeds. The next day, I hopped on a 21-hour multi-transport commute\
  \ towards home - and soon enough, I was back amidst the comfort of family and friends.\
  \ Despite the understatement that China is a country charged with immense environmental\
  \ and social issues, there exists a great beauty too. Taking a leap into the wilderness\
  \ was initially stamped from the intent of gaining a certain sense of novelty to\
  \ my travels. However, as I underwent this journey, I was instead humbled by the\
  \ novice of being a traveller and the majesty of Mother Earth herself."
