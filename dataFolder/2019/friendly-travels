Text: "\"To travel is to live\"... this excerpt from Hans Christian Anderson truly\
  \ embodies and expresses my philosophy of travel. Many of the happiest moments of\
  \ my life have been centered around my travel experiences. My travels have taken\
  \ me to India for a study abroad program in 2012, a mission trip to Haiti with my\
  \ college in 2017, and several holidays with friends in Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago\
  \ and most recently Ecuador. Each trip has opened my eyes to new ways of seeing\
  \ things, humbling me by reminding me what a tiny place I occupy in the world, and\
  \ leaving me with an absolute wanderlust to experience more. I was raised in a multicultural\
  \ household, culture has always played a major role in my life, my father is of\
  \ Mexican descent and my mother is of Finnish descent. I fondly look back on my\
  \ upbringing in a multi-ethnic family, enjoying Mexican tamales with my family on\
  \ Christmas Eve and Pannukakku (Finnish oven pancakes) on Christmas morning.  This\
  \ fusion of cultures has allowed me to view the world in many ways. From a very\
  \ young age my parents instilled in me to have an open heart and an acceptance of\
  \ others from different backgrounds and a passion for always helping and giving\
  \ back to others when I can. \n\nI began my own language learning journey around\
  \ the same time I began teaching ESL in Chicago as a young adult. Over the years,\
  \ I\u2019ve dabbled in languages such as Thai, Japanese and Hindi. In late 2017,\
  \ after ending a relationship with a Colombian I met while on vacation in Colombia\
  \ months prior (which is another story altogether!) I decided to put my focus on\
  \ studying a new language. I came across HelloTalk, a language app that allows you\
  \ to chat with people around the world. Native speakers teach you their language,\
  \ while you teach them yours. I think Portuguese is a very beautiful language and\
  \ have an affinity toward Brazilian culture, so I chose Portuguese as the language\
  \ to study. I spent the following days chatting with many Brazilians, practicing\
  \ writing and speaking each other\u2019s language and sharing about each other\u2019\
  s cultures. I met Diego, a 26-year-old Brazilian man from Salvador, Brazil through\
  \ this app. We continued chatting and began having video calls through WhatsApp.\
  \ Diego shared with me that he hadn\u2019t traveled outside Brazil before and his\
  \ dream is to visit the US someday. Unfortunately, Diego was denied a US visa during\
  \ two separate interviews in 2018.  \n\nI did not let this setback keep him down,\
  \ after a year of us communicating through WhatsApp, I purchased the two of us tickets\
  \ to travel to Ecuador together. On February 15, 2019 we both arrived in Quito,\
  \ Ecuador. Embarking on this trip, I was experiencing so many feelings. I was in\
  \ Ecuador, a country I hadn't visited before and about to meet my Brazilian friend\
  \ who I hadn't met in person before. To my relief our interactions together were\
  \ the same as the friendship we had fostered through long distance communication!\
  \ We spent 10 AMAZING days in Ecuador, staying at hostels, visiting historical sites\
  \ in Quito, stepping foot on the middle of the equator at Mitad del Mundo, trying\
  \ cuy (guinea pig) for the first time, hiking through the rainforest, visiting indigenous\
  \ communities, zip-lining, riding the swings at both El Vuelo del Condor and the\
  \ swing at the end of the world at Casa del Arbol in Banos, exploring the Las Pe\xF1\
  as neighborhood and Play Land Amusement Park in Guayaquil. There were a few times\
  \ conversations got a bit lost in translation, while communicating in English, Spanish\
  \ and Portuguese but in the end it always gave us a good laugh. When it comes to\
  \ my travels, I feel like a parent that could never pick their favorite child. Each\
  \ trip I've taken remains special to me for very different reasons. What I took\
  \ away from this trip was the joy of sharing the gift of travel with someone. Seeing\
  \ Diego's excitement, exuberant energy, and complete openness to try new things\
  \ while traveling outside his country for the very first time made the trip worth\
  \ it for me."
