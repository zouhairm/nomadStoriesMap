Text: "A year ago I was getting ready for my trip to Europe, my first solo trip, I\
  \ thought I had now a  bit of  a plan, yet I was not looking for something too precise,\
  \ I wanted to let things flow. \nI\u2019ve would never imagined how much my plans\
  \ were going to change. \n\nI was to go to London and from there to France, at least\
  \ Paris. I love Paris and French culture in general I feel this  strong connection\
  \ and probably because I am half French, so looking into part of where you once\
  \ came from was something I was looking forward to.\n\nI am looking for flights\
  \ to London or Paris, cheap flights and I must mention and emphasize that this I\
  \ quite an art. Coordinating dates and going back to your budget, keeping it as\
  \ cheap and as comfortable as possible. But hey, after a while, I finally had a\
  \ solid date and my credit card on hand to buy my flight.  When all of a sudden\
  \ non of these two destinations had an affordable flight price. I did come to think\
  \ of probably going to Madrid, Spain, yet not quite looking forward to it.  The\
  \ only reason I felt I should go was that one of my closest friends started living\
  \ in Madrid a few months before my trip. \n\nBeing honest I think this was one of\
  \ the best decisions I ever took during this trip! First of all my main flight was\
  \ from Mexico City to Madrid, no stops, and at a pretty affordable price!  That\u2019\
  s a winner!  I am pretty sure destiny wanted me to go, I didn\u2019t expect to have\
  \ such a good time and such a strong connection in Madrid.  There is a bit of a\
  \ background on why I felt very little enthusiasm on going to Spain. And I believe\
  \ this is mainly a cultural hold back. As far as I can remember I\u2019ve been told\
  \ in history class while in school and throughout my life as a Mexican that Spain\
  \ conquered Mexico and how this caused a big impact and how much pain there was\
  \ due to this back then in history. This not really a grudge I\u2019ve been holding\
  \ or anything like that, I guess it\u2019s something that just stays in the back\
  \ of your brain as a kind of a defensive reaction. \n\nThe very first day I am in\
  \ Spain, about a few hours after my plane landed I was heading to a bar with a friend,\
  \ and I felt as if I was out of my hometown immediately. Sure there are quite some\
  \ differences between Madrid and the place where I live in Mexico but really I felt\
  \ just like at home. I stayed in Madrid for a bit longer than a week  in a neighborhood\
  \ called La Latina, is one of Madrid\u2019s oldest neighborhoods, and just perfect!\
  \ It\u2019s found in the centre of Madrid.  This is the reason why you can find\
  \ narrow streets and old fashioned fronts in businesses and residences. Bars in\
  \ la Latina as well as night life are very popular along young people, due to this\
  \ fresh and worry free atmosphere you sense. I could always feel some kind of warmth,\
  \ a feeling of being safe as I walked from my apartment to a bar, through the beautiful\
  \ and colorful streets of Madrid. How it was always very nice sharing a glass of\
  \ wine or a beer with people in the bar, there are always friendly faces making\
  \ conversation. \n\nI should emphasize I didn\u2019t plan to have this cultural\
  \ and spiritual connection with Madrid, I think this was something I never expected\
  \ and that in someway healed that small wound I had.  Giving me instead this wonderful\
  \ travel experience, I will always hold a beautiful memory of Madrid and I can easily\
  \ recommend traveling to Madrid for everyone and specially for fellow Latin Americans,\
  \ you will feel just like at home."
