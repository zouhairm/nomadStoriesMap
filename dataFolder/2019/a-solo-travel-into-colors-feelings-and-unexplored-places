Text: "It was the Spring Break 2017, my very first (and last) spring break, since\
  \ in Italy -the country I\u2019m from- we do not have such a perfect holiday break\
  \ in the middle of the school year. But that year, I was an exchange student in\
  \ a small and stray college in the United States. \nEspecially after several weeks\
  \ of north American winter, Miami\u2019s sun, warm weather, beaches and fun attracted\
  \ the majority of my international friends, who took their flight south. I headed\
  \ norther: New York was my destination, a dream coming true. What a clich\xE9, you\
  \ may say. Yes, I love clich\xE9, but I love them my way.\nSo, on a sunny and promising\
  \ March afternoon I took my Greyhound bus (is it even an American experience if\
  \ you don\u2019t travel on a Greyhound bus!?) from Washington, D.C. to New York.\
  \ I arrived at night and I started my adventure. It was a leap in the unknown. Not\
  \ because I was alone -yes, also because of that, but not only. New York wasn\u2019\
  t the unknown, not entirely at least. This was my first solo travel and what I had\
  \ the chance to discover was actually myself.\nI realized I actually am a romantic\
  \ soul while walking in Central Park. Everything was covered in snow, with frozen\
  \ details drawing elaborate pictures on the stone walls of Belvedere Castle, or\
  \ on the statues decorating hidden spots of the park. I was surrounded by cute couples\
  \ walking hand in hand, or loud families with children tobogganing and snow fighting.\
  \ I felt so much love mixed with silence, the kind of silence between two people\
  \ that know each other so deep, that they do not need to talk out loud.\nAnother\
  \ thing I found out about myself is that I have a pretty good orientation sense,\
  \ which was helpful in finding my way through the city\u2019s neighborhoods. I started\
  \ from Washington Square Park, had a quick visit to Cherry Lane Theatre (the oldest\
  \ continuing running theatre) and then strolled around Greenwich village, where\
  \ rainbow flags stand for equality and rights. I couldn\u2019t help myself from\
  \ visiting Little Italy as well. And I was immediately surrounded by familiar signs\
  \ and names, \u201Czeppole\u201D, \u201Cpizza\u201D and other Italian products.\
  \ I felt like in my hometown for the length of Lafayette St. and it felt good. But\
  \ red bricks buildings with outside staircases made me realize I wasn\u2019t in\
  \ Europe at all. \nWhile walking on the Brooklyn Bridge, I got mesmerized by the\
  \ sunset. It was like watching a fire ball slowly igniting the skyscrapers, turning\
  \ everything into red and orange shades, and then falling in the water and creating\
  \ an eye-capturing motif. Everything was peace and quiet, even in the loudest traffic\
  \ of the city. You simply forget about cars and busses driving under your feet,\
  \ on the bridge lower floor; you just stare at that mixed sight of nature and humankind.\n\
  On my last day, I went up on the Empire State Building: I couldn\u2019t miss the\
  \ chance to look at the Whole city from the 102nd floor. In Europe, buildings can\
  \ go up to the 20th or 30th floor at most. Probably the Tour Eiffel was the highest\
  \ building I\u2019ve ever been to before and the Empire State Building was 82 meters\
  \ higher. When I first get outside, on the observation deck of the tower, here it\
  \ comes, that slight sense of dizziness, while looking down on the tiny cars and\
  \ even smaller pedestrians crowding the streets. Never felt vertigo before and yet,\
  \ I had to come to New York to have that feeling. But as soon as it came, it disappeared,\
  \ leaving me with just an incredible and breathtaking view of the city: skyscrapers,\
  \ houses, and Central Park, dressing winter and fall clothes at the same time.\n\
  For seven days in New York I walked step after step into the city, and the more\
  \ I was walking and discovering new parts of it, the more I was stepping into myself,\
  \ feeling feelings never felt before, appreciating things that I had never looked\
  \ at. As if every step was a step closer to unveiling some hidden parts of me."
