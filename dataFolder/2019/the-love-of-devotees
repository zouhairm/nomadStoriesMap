Text: "Kumbha Mela is a mass Hindu pilgrimage of faith in which Hindus gather to bathe\
  \ in a sacred or holy river. Traditionally, four fairs are widely recognized as\
  \ the Kumbh Melas: the Prayagraj Kumbh Mela, Haridwar Kumbh Mela, the Nashik-Trimbakeshwar\
  \ Simhastha, and Ujjain Simhastha. These four fairs are held periodically at one\
  \ of the following places by rotation: Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, Nashik district\
  \ (Nashik and Trimbak), and Ujjain. The main festival site is located on the banks\
  \ of a river: the Ganges (Ganga) at Haridwar; the confluence (Sangam) of the Ganges\
  \ and the Yamuna and the invisible Sarasvati at Allahabad; the Godavari at Nashik;\
  \ and the Shipra at Ujjain. Bathing in these rivers is thought to cleanse a person\
  \ of all their sins.\nKumbha Mela derives its name from both the original festival\
  \ being held according to the astrological sign \"Kumbha\" (Aquarius), and from\
  \ the associated Hindu legend in which the gods and demons fought over a pot, or\
  \ \u201Ckumbh,\u201D of nectar that would give them immortality. A later day addition\
  \ to the legend which says that after taking the pot one of the gods spilled drops\
  \ of nectar near four places where Kumbha Mela is presently held, is not found in\
  \ the earliest mentions of the original legend of samudra manthan (churning of the\
  \ ocean) as described in various ancient Hindu texts collectively known as the Puranas\
  \ (orig. 3rd century CE to 10th century CE).\nThe legend of samudra manthan tells\
  \ of a battle between the Devas (benevolent deities) and Asuras (malevolent demigods)\
  \ for amrita, the nectar drink of immortality. During samudra manthan, amrita was\
  \ produced and placed in a Kumbha (pot). To prevent the asuras from seizing the\
  \ amrita, a divine carrier flew away with the pot. In one of the most popular versions\
  \ added to the original legend later, the carrier of the kumbha is the divine physician\
  \ Dhanavantari, who stops at four places where the Kumbh Mela is celebrated. In\
  \ other later addition to the legend, the carrier is Garuda, Indra or Mohini, who\
  \ spills the amrita at four places."
