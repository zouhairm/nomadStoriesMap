Text: "The moment I stepped out of that airplane, humidity slapped me on the face.\
  \ It was just another night of early September of Beirut.\nAli, a friend of my mom\u2019\
  s friend picked us up at the airport. It was dark and there was no way I could see\
  \ the beauty of the city, The Mediterranean. It was quite different from after midnight\
  \ in my hometown, Tehran. Streets were crowded, caf\xE9s and restaurants were full\
  \ of people and stores were open. We were to pass through several Muslim residential\
  \ districts of Beirut to get to our home to be. Each street was completely different\
  \ from another. We went from wide boulevards with modern Arabic architecture full\
  \ of long apartment buildings with more than six floors, stone facades, and gigantic\
  \ luxury furnished balconies covered with glass curtains to narrow borderless streets\
  \ with dirty old cars chaotically parked on the side, smaller simple cement looking\
  \ buildings yet with several huge balconies. The difference though, was that these\
  \ balconies were covered with colored fabric outdoor curtains instead of glass,\
  \ which made the area look a little bit sloppy. \nAs the car slowed down while we\
  \ were turning into an alley, I sensed that we were getting close and started anxiously\
  \ analyzing the neighborhood. It was nothing like how I dreamt it to be, the opposite!\
  \ \nA number of men in their colored shorts and white inner vests had set up plastic\
  \ round tables with a few chairs on the street side and the left corner of the alley.\
  \ They were sitting together, talking and laughing loud, smoking Arabic hookah.\
  \ Above them, I saw an old 5-floor building that seemed filthy even though I couldn\u2019\
  t get a clear view. It was dark and a stall was blocking my view. They had set up\
  \ a metal roofed structure on the whole alley where they can gather up at nights,\
  \ pray and celebrate Muslim\u2019s fasting days of Ramadan. The stall was decorated\
  \ with colored buntings.\nOn the right corner, a wide land looked abandoned. Scrappers\
  \ must have been taking advantage of it by turning it to a wrecking yard. There\
  \ were cars on top of cars with other junks lying around and in between them. \n\
  The whole picture wasn\u2019t quite my taste, you know? Those men with their hookah,\
  \ the stall, and more importantly the scrapyard! Which I later named \u201CThe Cemetery\
  \ of Cars\u201D!\nWe got out of the car inside the stall. Ali pointed to the same\
  \ building I was checking out earlier saying: \u201CThere it is.\u201D All the things\
  \ that I\u2019ve seen in the past few minutes came back to me at the same time.\
  \ I felt the tears down on my cheek, started constantly nagging about the place,\
  \ and said I want to go back! My mom handled the situation, by asking me to go in\
  \ with her and get the next flight back to Tehran.\nThere was an opening to the\
  \ building inside the stall. We went in and to the 4th floor. We opened the door\
  \ and turned the lights on. It was awfully nasty, which took my mom and her friend\
  \ Sohaila forever to clean the apartment.\nWe were placing the boxes in one room\
  \ when suddenly the power went out. My mom put us to bed but Sarah and I stayed\
  \ up talking for the rest of the night. After a while, we heard someone\u2019s knock\
  \ on our door. We didn\u2019t expect anyone on our door at 3 am in the morning during\
  \ the blackout! We all ran to the door and looked at each other worriedly, while\
  \ suddenly we heard Ali\u2019s voice saying: \u201CI brought food\u201D. My mom\
  \ opened the door, Ali gave us a basket and left. He brought Jibne Manaish; a traditional\
  \ Lebanese food similar to pizza that only has cheese on top.\nThe next day, Sohaila\
  \ and my mom washed all curtains and sofa upholsteries for god knows how many times,\
  \ changed the sheets and carpets until it finally felt like home. We never talked\
  \ about going back again. I stayed and lived in Beirut for five years and ate Jibne\
  \ Manaish a thousand times but that first one was by far the best I\u2019ve ever\
  \ had."
