Text: "I\u2019ll end up in my mom\u2019s hands.\n \nThis is insane. Its been three\
  \ days since i and my friend, Hayu decided to traveling with our limit budget to\
  \ Lombok. Without flight. From Semarang tawang station, slept at surabaya station,\
  \ order ferry ship in Tanjung Perak harbor, and now both of us inside massive truck\
  \ which bring another thing besides us, maybe natural resource such us woods. \n\
  \nJust a moment ago in ferry, we met man from navy army who need our help to announce\
  \ that Legundi Ship will arrive. Hayu asked what\u2019s the cheapest tranportation\
  \ from Lembar Harbor to the city? That man whose name Rus offered a great option,\
  \ he offered some help, he will contact the truck driver to take us to the Mataram\
  \ town for free. Our heart was warm, we feel so grateful because met kind people\
  \ like him. Here, i so enthusiastic but how about my mom? \n\nIn the middle of my\
  \ crowd brain, i suddenly ask to the driver, random question. \u201CWhat the meaning\
  \ of \u2018how much\u2019 in Sasak language?\u201D\n\n\u201CPire.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  What\u2019s for?\u201D Hayu look me with the strange gaze. \u201CFor make a great\
  \ deal with seller. If we use Sasak language they will think we native, so we can\
  \ get the price cheaper, isn\u2019t it sir?\u201D The Driver laughing out loud,\
  \ and that\u2019s enough to believed me that i must learn local language first.\n\
  \nHayu nod as much as she can, \u201Cwhat the meaning of \u2018one\u2019?\u201D\n\
  \n\u201CSekek. You can say like this sekek, pire? wich means \u2018how much this\
  \ one?\u201D \n\nAs long as our journey in truck we talk about our story, i and\
  \ Hayu about our reckless trip and the driver about his job. Every month he will\
  \ go to Java bring wood, and from Java he come back with another thing, he always\
  \ miss his family in Selong. \u201CBut that\u2019s the risk from this job.\u201D\
  \nWe split up in the town, all we can say just thank you and hand wave.\n\nI and\
  \ Hayu return our journey to rest in hostel. We need to take a shower after rarely\
  \ 3 days feel like beggar. During after we get off the truck, we repeat again and\
  \ again the lesson that we have studied as like sekek pire? We counting too, sikek,\
  \ due, telu, empat, lime, enem, pituk, balu\u2019, siwa\u2019, sepulu. \n\n\u201C\
  Hei, we can come to Bu Endang\u2019s home!\u201D say Hayu out of the blue. \u201C\
  She want us to go to her house, we can go? This is her address.\u201D \n\nThat\u2019\
  s not bad idea, Bu Endang is the old lady whom we met in ferry. She and her husband\
  \ have helped us in ship. So, with motorcycle both of us go to her home. We still\
  \ exercise sasak language, because we remember, near Bu Endang\u2019s house any\
  \ souvenir popular market that she told us before, the best place to find great\
  \ quality woven fabric Lombok, said her.\n\nWe stop exercise when we arrive. No,\
  \ not just stop because of we must start conversation with Bu endang\u2019s family,\
  \ more than that. Bu Endang and her mate ask us to go inside her house. Still little\
  \ messy but comfort enough, we meet her second daughter and her son in law. We talk\
  \ much, our adventure, our plan, what the place or food we must go to and try, about\
  \ they\u2019re life. So much fun.\n\n\u201CYou can stay here. There\u2019s one room\
  \ left here, you can cancel your hostel booking don\u2019t you? I\u2019ll cook taliwang\
  \ chicken and plecing kale for you.\u201D\n\nI and Hayu staring each other, \u201C\
  but we\u2019ve reserved the hostel.\u201D We booking the hotel early before we meet\
  \ Bu Endang\u2019s family. Bu Endang look sad, \u201Chow about motorcycle, you can\
  \ borrow mine.\u201D That\u2019s favor make us happy, touched, and blue at once,\
  \ \u201Cwe have too. So sorry.\u201D\n\n\u201CHow about souvenir\u2019s place that\
  \ i told you? Did you go to there? Just now?\u201D We shook our head hard, \u201C\
  not yet!\u201D say us too excited. At the moment, she smiles \u201Ci\u2019ll take\
  \ you there.\u201D\n\n\u201CReally?\u201D Hayu gasp. She nod calmly.\n\nWe don\u2019\
  t need practice sasak language. We don\u2019t need to learn local language in Lombok,\
  \ because heart is the language over here, not Sasak."
