Text: "When people say sweaty they might think of an hour on the treadmill and reaching\
  \ for a small fashionable towel once in a while. Or, maybe they think of a few hours\
  \ walking around a department store searching for something unknown. When I say\
  \ sweaty I mean: hair dripping, sandal blistering, white to yellow T-shirt, and\
  \ definitely no sex unless you want to be tasting each others salt, type of sweat.\
  \ This is exactly what Seville last August was like. It was time spent hopping in\
  \ and out of the shade to avoid 40 degree rays, taking a shower 15 minutes after\
  \ showering for the second time that day and spending more than a days food budget\
  \ on bottles of water. \nThe first stop on a six week adventure around Europe and\
  \ the city least unknown to me. All I knew is that I was travelling from Portugal\
  \ to Spain to a city friends had told me had links to Game of Thrones and was the\
  \ home of flamenco. Naturally I had glanced at photos: A city, cartoon like, almost\
  \ too colourful and idyllic to be real. I arrived in Seville on that sweltering\
  \ August day to a bustling Plaza de Armas filled with eager travellers and city\
  \ goers alike. As I hobbled off the bus legs bound by cramp and into the heat wave\
  \ I was doubtful that this city may indeed not look like the photos. I saw dusty\
  \ cars, tall buildings that seemed to have been turned inside out displaying their\
  \ cables. I saw graffiti sprawled onto the side of an ancient tobacco shop, I saw\
  \ a bustling Spanish city- nothing I hadn't seen before.\nI soon realised that I\
  \ was wrong, the photos do not give the sound, sights, smell or tastes of this city\
  \ the justice it deserves. It takes alot to leave a person speechless but as you\
  \ make your way up the steps to the entrance to the Plaza de Espana the sight is\
  \ something so peaceful, beautiful and serene that words cannot describe. Hot air\
  \ fills my nose with a calming aroma full of temptation and nostalgia. Blue, green\
  \ and pink burst from the painted tiles and mesmerize my eyes, while the hot orange\
  \ earth beneath my feet guides me to the beautiful fountain central to the scene.\
  \ As I watch the horse and trap pull up to the circular courtyard a soft strum on\
  \ guitar rings softly yet profoundly into my ears. As if perfectly in time, two\
  \ lovers step down from the cart and stare longingly into each others eyes. All\
  \ I can focus on is the beauty of the scene being echoed by the man behind me playing\
  \ out what sounds to be his soul as he sings out to the fantastic acoustics of the\
  \ Plaza walls. The sound bounces around as if running down the bow of a harp.\n\
  The sounds of buen dia and vino echo round the cobbles as I continue to go from\
  \ Eslava to Dos de Mayo, getting lost through this southern maze, never feeling\
  \ as satisfyingly full yet longing for more food. Patatas bravas that tingle, garlic\
  \ covered seafood that left me licking my lips for days, tortilla so warm and comforting.\
  \ All topped off with fresh fruit infused boozy sangria that left me wandering the\
  \ sunkissed streets feeling as i didn't expect: all together drunk in love with\
  \ Seville."
