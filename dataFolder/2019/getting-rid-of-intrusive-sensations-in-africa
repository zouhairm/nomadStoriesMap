Text: "\u201CGhana is Africa for beginners,\u201D I read in the travel guide found\
  \ in the ship library. \n\nA week later, upon the disembarkation on the Gold Coast,\
  \ I thought I was ready to meet the continent, yet there was an intrusive sensation\
  \ of the unknown. \u201CIt\u2019s not fear,\u201D I told myself.\n\nThe port was\
  \ rimmed by discouraging skeletons of industrial cranes scattered along the coast.\
  \ I looked around, seeking conventional sightseeing, and found nothing but stacks\
  \ of cargo containers and chain-link fencing \u2014 visitors are not allowed to\
  \ walk around the port. Besides, passengers getting off my ship were the only tourists\
  \ around. \n\nThe bus ride from the port of Tema to the capital city, Accra, mesmerized\
  \ with heavy traffic and astonishing views of inventive roadside commerce: numerous\
  \ God is Great Inc. tire shops, To God be the Glory Co. electronics shops and inexhaustible\
  \ college advertisements. I recalled an article calling Ghana the fastest growing\
  \ economy in Africa. No wonder the streets are brimming with ambition and energy.\
  \ Too bad everything was covered in dust though; I could barely read the pious names\
  \ of well-groomed shack shops. \n\nAn hour later, I got a good feel and taste of\
  \ the dust, as Accra welcomed me with a warm, winnowing blow. Perhaps, commerce\
  \ and dust cohabit in Ghana, for I was surrounded by friendly looking trinket sellers\
  \ as soon as I got off the bus. They all insisted I buy a bracelet or a painting\
  \ to make sure I remember Ghana after the departure. I have a feeling I do not need\
  \ any bracelets to remember this trip, I explained.  \n\nI crossed the road to escape\
  \ the knickknacks, walked down the street and found myself amid a market, overrun\
  \ by carved wooden statues, brass candlesticks, folded tapestries and even more\
  \ trinkets. \u201CWhere you from?\u201D asked a seller. I started talking but got\
  \ distracted by fried rats or something that looked like fried rats at the neighboring\
  \ stall. The intrusive sensation was still there. \u201CI am okay,\u201D I had to\
  \ tell myself.\n\nThat evening some friends and I went to the Jamestown lighthouse.\
  \ After watching a football game across the street, we found out that the lighthouse\
  \ is closed for the day. I took my phone out to document that very special sunset\
  \ \u2014 the end of my first day in Africa.\n\nStaring into the viewfinder, I noticed\
  \ a shabby staircase leading from the lighthouse down to the beach. All I could\
  \ see was clouds of smoke coming out of wooden huts. I decisively strapped the camera\
  \ back on my shoulder but stood rooted to the spot. The sensation. I hesitated.\
  \ Suddenly, a boy approached me from behind, touched me on a shoulder and suggested\
  \ he shows around. The boy looked around 12 and had a remarkably sincere smile on\
  \ his face. I always choose to believe that there are more good people around than\
  \ ill-natured ones, whether it comes to seeking for help in a strange neighborhood\
  \ or hitchhiking across a border. And if these strangers smile so sincerely, it\
  \ must be a good sign.\n\nDesmond, my new friend, skipped down the stairs and started\
  \ enthusiastically pointing at things around him. Here is a woman at her shack,\
  \ she is putting a pot on top of a pile of red-hot coal. There are children kicking\
  \ around what could possibly had been a football. Over there is a man pouring a\
  \ bucket of water over himself and rubbing his body with soap. His rubs resembled\
  \ jerks, as if it had something to do with my presence. I hurried Desmond towards\
  \ the beach. His jolly gait communicated how excited he was to show a tourist around\
  \ the township. Finally, we ran onto grainy, thick sand. The waves were washing\
  \ rafts of garbage onto the shore. There were trash mountains as far as I could\
  \ see down the beach. \u201CIt\u2019s fine,\u201D I read in Desmond\u2019s eyes.\
  \ \n\nThe intrusive feeling was gone, for as long as the locals\u2019 wide smiles\
  \ are sincere, there is nothing to fear. The sun slowly disappeared behind the ship\u2019\
  s funnel as we were approaching. \u201CSo, how was your first day in Africa?\u201D\
  \ asked the taxi driver."
