Text: "Galicia used to be the end of the world. Finisterre, or \u201Cthe end of the\
  \ Earth\u201D marked the point where old sailors thought to be the limit of existence.\
  \ But to me, this land became the place I met a witch. As full of legends sea tales\
  \ of the area might be, none captured more magic that the figure of the meiga. \n\
  Stories about meigas, or witches, are as old as Galicia itself. Galicia is one of\
  \ the few areas of Spain that are covered by green, humid, fresh forests where one\
  \ cannot see the sky with the foliage above. The Celtic customs and tales have left\
  \ behind rich folklore, many already forgotten. Meigas, however, persevere.\nAsk\
  \ a Galician whether they believe in meigas and he or she will answer \u201CEu non\
  \ creo nas meigas, mais habelas, hainas.\u201D I don\xB4t believe in meigas, but\
  \ there are meigas here. \nMeigas are to Galicia what beer is to Germany, pasta\
  \ to Italy, hygge to Denmark, and student debt to the U.S. Without understanding\
  \ meigas, one cannot know a thing about Galicia. \nIt was a cloudy summer day when\
  \ I met meigas, accompanied by an old friend. My Galician friend had the feeling\
  \ that she had the evil eye. She had to do something because she had an important\
  \ job interview and the possible foreclosure of her home depended on it. I had tried\
  \ to reason with her about practicing her interview skills, but she knew her case\
  \ required something more mystical. \nThere are many kinds of meigas. The meiga\
  \ Chuchona will suck the blood from children to make potions. The Feiticeira will\
  \ wait near the riverbank and attract young boys who will drown in the water. The\
  \ Lobismuller, or wolfwoman, who will have been born on Chrismas Eve from an all-daughters\
  \ family. But some, people say, are magic-infused women whom people affected by\
  \ evil will seek.\nWe drove through a forest road and hour from Santiago. The air\
  \ was loaded with pressure, and a storm was approaching. We arrived at a rural.\
  \ The meigas we were on our way to meet never received people who had not been recommended.\
  \ Apparently, my friend said, we were very lucky.\nA woman came to meet us outside.\
  \ She was in her 90s, but she could have been in her 1000s. She walked with difficulty\
  \ using a rustic cane, and she was the most wrinkle person I have seen. \nThe house\
  \ was divided into two parts: a big room which was used as a kitchen and wood fire,\
  \ and a second room used as a living room and dormitory. The old woman\xB4s sister,\
  \ who appeared to be even older than the other woman, was seated next to the fire.\
  \ She was blind, and had a hump so pronounced she could not stand up without her\
  \ sister\xB4s help. \nThey insisted on testing both of us for the evil eye. The\
  \ test consisted of a pendulum hanging from our finger. If it moved, we were cursed.\
  \ \nAnd of course, it moved!\nThe ritual to purify us and removed the evil eye was\
  \ confusing. It involved taking our shoes off and smoked them over the fire with\
  \ some herbs, to put our faces above the fire, too, and breathed it. Which, as I\
  \ was coughing afterward, I kind of wanted to press my friend\xB4s face against\
  \ the burning wood. \nAfter the purification, the woman held our hands and told\
  \ us we were free from evil. Then, to my surprise, she didn\xB4t accept any money.\
  \ My friend told me later than real meigas never charged. As we were leaving, my\
  \ friend seemed lighter than I had seen her in a while. \nA week later, she called\
  \ me on the phone to let me know she had gotten the job, and thus, she would be\
  \ able to keep her home. Only then, hearing my friend\xB4s voice of relief, was\
  \ that I understood the sentence \u201CEu non creo nas meigas, mais habelas, hainas.\u201D\
  \ Because I still don\xB4t believe in meigas, but there are meigas out there."
