Text: "I wish I could start this story with the line \u201CThere comes a time when\
  \ every person must find their peace\u201D. We don\u2019t live in that world though.\
  \ This is no tale of dystopia or cynicism though, this is the story of the thrill\
  \ of the hunt for something beyond the thrill.\nThe year is 2019. Though it could\
  \ have been 2012, 2029 or even 2060. The year didn\u2019t matter.\nI was 21 years\
  \ old. Though I could have been 14, 31 or even 62. My age didn\u2019t matter.\n\
  My name is Jack William Chandler. Though I could have worn any other name because\
  \ some moments are bigger than time, age or identity. Some moments shape a new persona\
  \ in a way that brings clarity to a shrouded life or more importantly, a smile to\
  \ a tired face.\nAs I stepped out of the car in Plymouth, I knew none of this. I\
  \ was on home soil of sorts and yet it was all foreign to me. A childhood of playing\
  \ proverbial pinball across this wonderful world of ours had rendered the concept\
  \ of home mere philosophy, an abstract concept that I wasn\u2019t aloud to take\
  \ part in, that I knew not how to take part in. I unloaded my life into a new apartment,\
  \ another stop off for this nomad and sat down to see what this sphere of the world\
  \ held for me, what this corner had to offer. There seemed to be nothing. A couple\
  \ of buildings, nice ones maybe. I didn\u2019t know. There was the ocean, of sorts,\
  \ the waves that I could see were broken and diminished by human hands, a massive\
  \ barrier curbed their onslaught on to the land and left them unassuming.\nIt took\
  \ days before I was bored enough of my own company to venture outside. The rain\
  \ had ceased after a seemingly endless stream had poured from the clouds for several\
  \ cycles of both moon and sun taking turns to fill the sky. The wind held brisk\
  \ awakening and I chuckled at the cold. The same warped gales carried the fragments\
  \ of crashing waves with them, landing the spray of salt water on my face and clothes.\
  \ It was cold. The kind of cold that doesn\u2019t bite. There were two paths, one\
  \ leading left toward a car park and one leading right toward a few more buildings\
  \ and restaurants. I went straight forward, climbing under a railing and finding\
  \ my way down to the boulders that lay between land and ocean. These colossal geological\
  \ giants were inorganic amphibians, harbouring the life that the high tide brought\
  \ them and revelling in the sun that low tide offered. \nSomewhere between the two\
  \ tides, in the no mans land of wet rocks and soaked pools I sat. I watched how\
  \ the water receded and left parts of itself, like gifts to the land. As the ocean\
  \ drew back unto itself the waves fought the withdrawal. With every wave seeming\
  \ to try to pull the ocean back to the shallow land it had only recently occupied.\
  \ The waves were mere noise. The ocean a mere view. My thoughts were fixated on\
  \ how the water showed itself to me. The pool was calm, an epicentre of serenity\
  \ that slowed my lungs. That demanded my heart beat a little quieter so as not to\
  \ disturb the presence. It was love of the inorganic kind. The pool was the caress\
  \ of the ocean, the beautiful memory it left behind and the promise of how kind\
  \ it could be, how gentle, how tender it wanted to be. While the waves crashed and\
  \ shaped the rock it seemed to adore, to shift something so gentle as water in to\
  \ something as violent as hurtful as the hammer that carved the rocks in to shape.\
  \ \nI did not expect to find such agonisingly beautiful love in a rockpool, some\
  \ boulders and the crashing waves. The projection of my philosophy shaped by water\
  \ and stone. In the presence of the ocean I felt neither alone or without a home."
