Text: "Being in the City of the World hongkong is, it's truly magical place to be\
  \ at. Being able to find myself lost in the beauty of the country side and most\
  \ amazing trails that i can either run and challenge my physical strength, as I'm\
  \ a trail runners and did completed 45k ultra trail  run recently, apart of two\
  \ times Spartan race Super i did in 2018, or to take relaxing hikes and enjoy the\
  \ magnificent views from the trails that always different every time, depending\
  \ on the weather. And practicing my amateur skills in photography, while taking\
  \ a long walk of the old streets, temples, and historical buildings is also the\
  \ interesting things to do in hongkong. All that can be done and enjoy within a\
  \ short distance of transportation from the city that always busy. \nMy wish is\
  \ that, i could be able to explore more of the trails in the world, and do my loves\
  \ of trails running. At the same time, to be able to discover the beauty of each\
  \ country i will visits, witnessing the transformation of the of the development\
  \ of the old to the new and the uniqueness of each country . That's my ultimate\
  \ pleasure in my life that i hope i could do more"
