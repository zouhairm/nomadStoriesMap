Text: "\u201CBlooming inward\u201D would be the word to describe how travelling has\
  \ made up myself of today. I am not religious, also not too spirtitual but I really\
  \ believe in the signs. The compass of my life is not to take anything for granted.\
  \ I believe every person or event that happen to your life gives you a sign of action.\
  \ I started doing yoga with my indian mentor when I was 17, from him I listened\
  \ all the stories about India, had the very first taste of chicken tikka masala,\
  \ the first Roti. Before going to Taiwan for studying abroad, I got a nose ring,\
  \ to remind me whenever Looking into the mirror : \u201Dhey, India awaits you.\u201D\
  \ After one year studying in Taiwan, I won a short-term study in Czech Republic\
  \ with my school department, where I met my Indian mates. We became good friends,\
  \ spent the most precious time together. I recognized Indian people are very proud\
  \ of their countries and passionate about their culture. surrounded by people who\
  \ are such passionate Inspired me. After the first trip to Europe, I hunted a ticket\
  \ to India. 6 months later after my first semester final exam, i packed up my backpack\
  \ and come to the land that I thought I would never set my foot on within the next\
  \ 10 years. \nIndia has never disappointed me, simply, I never let anything let\
  \ me down. It\u2019s a trip that combines both homestay and sooo travelling. The\
  \ first days I visited my Indian friends\u2019 family, stay with their family and\
  \ learn how to cook the food, deep myself in the culture. I wore Kurti everyday,\
  \ listen to the music, went vegetarian. After leaving my host families in the South,\
  \ I made my solo trips to the Northern India, that is where I met few of my new\
  \ inspirations. I still remember one time in Jaipur, I met an Indian backpacker\
  \ and got the malaria there. Thanks to him, when the disease broke out, he helped\
  \ me a lot. I insisted on keeping my travelling route to Agra regardless of the\
  \ disease, he bought a ticket and took the night bus with me to Agra just to make\
  \ sure I am alright and left to New Delhi after that. Before saying goodbye, I felt\
  \ so lucky and told him how great to have met him. he told me one sentence that\
  \ I would remember for my whole life: \u201Cyou\u2019re not lucky, you\u2019re simply\
  \ clever. Whenever you travel, you will become smarter that you know who to trust\
  \ in.\u201D When I was in front the door of death, I did put my life into his hand,\
  \ It was risky, but I trusted him. Having those experience doesn\u2019t mean blinding\
  \ myself, i did see the backwards, the common problems in the national identity\
  \ but that what travelling teaches you: to accept and understand, not to against.\
  \ When you are a minority in a majority, it is not the problem of right or wrong,\
  \ it is the differences.\nI have never lost passion for India, also never stopped\
  \ to grow interests in any other cultures. Since I move to Germany, I met a lot\
  \ of people from Middle East countries and also learn a lot about culture and manner.\
  \ I found out this world is getting integrated, all the expats grew from different\
  \ background but they all changed and adopted new cultures that it is not even hard\
  \ at all to be friends with each other. That\u2019s actually our future. People\
  \ are different but shared the same soul, humanity. Culture is the beautiful thing\
  \ to be preserved and honored, not to be culted and used as weapons. As an IR students\
  \ i just want to let all people have the same feeling that i am having right now,\
  \ to have that empathy that i have gained during my Journey. I found myself in those\
  \ trips, I explored the world but now to show people what i achieved. I was simply\
  \ finding my inner self so I call it self exploration. Everyone should move their\
  \ steps, open their heart, learn about their identity and share the empathy to other\
  \ identities. That is the flower that \u201Cblooming inward\u201D."
