Text: "\u201CSo we are going to the land of your dreams!\u201D, said my teenager\n\
  \n\u201CI hope we are taking a road trip?\u201D, asked her doctor sibling\n\nScotland\
  \ is my all-time favourite dream destination, I love the accent of the people there;\
  \ the way they welcome  foreigners  with open arms; the best part- the lovely weather.\n\
  \nBased at Muthu Newton Hotel in the outskirts of Inverness we planned a day trip\
  \ to Applecross. As I wanted to be surprised, I refused to read up anything about\
  \ Applecross.\n\nWe were not  too worried about the Bealach na Ba not being meant\
  \ for novice drivers  we have taken road trips on the length and breadth of India\
  \ where the roads are notoriously dangerous.\n\nThe trip to Applecross was planned\
  \ meticulously. It included a lot of sight - seeing on the way: Loch Ness(I need\
  \ another essay to write about that experience), Eilean Donan Castle and not to\
  \ forget the quaint little hotel Ledgowan Lodge Hotel where we stopped for a break.\
  \ We experienced what the Scots had told us \u2013 all the seasons in one day- Rain,\
  \ sunshine, mist and wind all in the space of two hours! Every bend had a new scenery\
  \ to behold.\nWe went across Loch Carron and reached the point where the Bealach\
  \ na Ba pass starts. Clearly written in bold letters was written: Not meant for\
  \ learner drivers! There was an option of taking another safer route, but the thought\
  \ never occurred to us!\n\nOh My God! I never expected the exhilaration and the\
  \ excitement that this trip gave me. The road was narrow and winding. It was so\
  \ narrow that after every kilometre or more frequently there is a \u201Cpassing\
  \ place\u201D where you need to wait for the oncoming traffic to pass by! The sheer\
  \ drop made me catch my breath. The road (I found out later boasts of a 20% gradient)\
  \ was a crazy mix of horror, fear and happiness for me. I sat on the edge of the\
  \ seat as we climbed up the pass and only relaxed when we reached the top (2054\
  \ ft). The land around had a fairy-tale quality- bluer than blue sky with fluffy\
  \ clouds sailing; the grassy sides were golden green; there were no trees but a\
  \ lot of lovely smooth stones. As I looked down, I saw the winding roads below us\
  \ and I marvelled that we had made it to the top. There were a lot of very disciplined\
  \ cyclists who were also taking a break here. I wished I had the fitness to do what\
  \ they were doing! We were supposed to be at Applecross by One o\u2019clock but\
  \ here we were taking selfies on the top! \nDo not make the mistake of thinking\
  \ that the way down is a piece of cake! It is equally beautiful, tortuous and exhilarating.\
  \ The roller coaster ride continued even on the way down. As we approached Applecross,\
  \ we saw many of the hairy cows of Scotland by the road munching away at the juicy\
  \ green grass. ( I bought myself a toy hairy cow for memory sake!)\n\nNothing had\
  \ prepared me for the first sight of Applecross; as we drove down the winding road,\
  \ the clear blue waters of the Applecross Bay welcomed us. It was hard to believe\
  \ that the placid water in the bay was the sea, it looked more like a calm lake.\
  \ The mountains across stood tall and majestic, it would take another trip to explore\
  \ them.The water was so clear and beautiful. I did not see one bit of trash on the\
  \ shore. A chilly wind was blowing as the Sun competed with it to keep us warm.\
  \ We parked on Shore street and decided to have lunch at the Applecross inn.\n\n\
  Having spent more than a week in a foreign land, I had no expectations from the\
  \ meal that we were about to partake. It would be bland I thought to myself, but\
  \ when you are hungry everything goes.\n\nWas I ever wrong \u2013 the succulent\
  \ roast chicken with vegetables and mashed potatoes with  a slice of bread was perfect.\
  \ A wonderful finale to an exciting day!"
