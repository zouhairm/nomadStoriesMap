Text: "The sign warned that there was no trail further ahead, but we ignored it. I\
  \ was the only one getting nervous. Nervous about getting back on time not about\
  \ getting lost. Francisco led the way, he alone knew where we were going, three\
  \ of us followed.\n\nWe were all housemates for a week \u2014 the others trying\
  \ to make a life for themselves in New Zealand, and I on my first solo trip. We\
  \ were different. That day we shared a trip to Piha Beach and our differences didn\u2019\
  t matter. Until they did. \n\nThe guys had the day off and they wanted to explore\
  \ the area. I had to be available online in several hours \u2014 my day involved\
  \ important work. When Francisco offered to take us to a spot nearby I refused.\
  \ I was fine where I was \u2014 standing on the black-sand beach beneath Lion Rock.\
  \ The rock didn\u2019t resemble a lion from my perspective, but hearing the wind\
  \ roar from its peak made me feel like I\u2019m in the presence of a wild animal.\
  \ I felt freedom there. A strong sense of urgency dominated that feeling, and I\
  \ soon wanted to go home. The others insisted that I go with them for a walk, and\
  \ I gave in. Francisco assured me the spot was only twenty minutes away. He gave\
  \ no other description. I wasn\u2019t happy with this, but I got curious nonetheless.\n\
  \nIt didn\u2019t take long for my curiosity to turn into anxiety. We were walking\
  \ knee-deep in grass, we weren\u2019t on a trail, and there was no reception. Why\
  \ did I agree to this?. It was adventurous. I wanted adventures in my solo travel,\
  \ but I wanted them on my terms. That day I wanted predictability, and I had none.\
  \ \n\nWe arrived. I realized we did because I had to climb down a tall rock \u2014\
  \ my rumination was interrupted. I stepped on a small stretch of black sand. Tall\
  \ volcanic rocks enclosed the sand and dense green forest enclosed the rocks. A\
  \ cave ripped one of the boulders, and through it, you could see the waves of the\
  \ Tasman Sea breaking. The white foam from the waves met the fresh water of a small\
  \ waterfall when it finally reached the sand I was standing on. Depending on what\
  \ grabbed your attention, the nature of this beach-like spot altered \u2014 calm,\
  \ quiet when you looked at the waterfall and intense, wild when you watched the\
  \ waves break.\n\nWe didn\u2019t stay long, and I managed to get back home on time.\
  \ But I felt like a lifetime had passed. The duality of this place resonated with\
  \ me, and I started thinking about the essence of travel. The moments spent there\
  \ changed my perspective. I traveled to get out of my comfort zone, I realized,\
  \ but even though I wandered far, I hadn\u2019t escaped.\n\nGood travel experiences\
  \ don\u2019t depend on the distance: they happen when you immerse yourself in the\
  \ present. Only then can the unknown feel like home and people you\u2019ve just\
  \ met can become old friends. Sometimes you have to go halfway across the world\
  \ to be changed by travel, sometimes all it takes is a twenty minutes walk \u2014\
  \ it took me both."
