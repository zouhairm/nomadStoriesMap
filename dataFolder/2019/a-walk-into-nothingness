Text: "A walk into nothingness...\n\n\tIt was already noon when I decided to go for\
  \ it. I wanted to have the experience on my own. No middle men, no intermediaries.\
  \ Only me and peyote in the desert. That was it. \n\n\tSan Luis Potos\xED\xB4s desert\
  \ is a vast land in the middle northern planes of Mexico. This  is one of the few\
  \ places in the world where peyote (lophophora williamsii) grows. Peyote means \u201C\
  the vibration of the heart\u201D in nahuatl, a native tongue in Mexico. It has been\
  \ used as a medicine for a very long time from many different tribes in our country,\
  \ specially Wirraritari people who go in long walks all the way from Nayarit and\
  \ Jalisco on the west to the desert, to gather the medicine which they use in many\
  \ different ways mostly to heal the body, the mind and the soul.\n\n\tSo there I\
  \ was walking with no expectations at all. All I knew was that I had to keep going,\
  \ maybe at some point before dusk, gather some firewood and if, only if peyote decided\
  \ to show itself, then I\u2019d be ready for it. \n\n\tAfter a few logs and sticks\
  \ for my fire I finally saw a couple of peyotes, right underneath a governor plant.\
  \ It meant a lot to me since when it finds you it\u2019s literally a call to be\
  \ with it. It is supposed to be that the first one you find you don\u2019t cut,\
  \ you put offerings to it like corn grains, maybe some cacao as well and a lit candle\
  \ since in the end on our native beliefs, all the way from the aztec people, we\
  \ know everything is a living entity and peyote is not an exception at all. So after\
  \ putting a prayer and offerings I stood up and kept up with the wood and in less\
  \ than five seconds I found a full family patch with at least fifty of them altogether.\
  \ Then I knew I was ready for it and so it was for me. Cut two of them and decided\
  \ to build my fire since it was already dusk and it\u2019d be a long night. \n\n\
  \tWith my fire set I was ready to go for it. Grabbed a few of them, took them into\
  \ my mouth and started chewing. After a few minutes I could start feeling its presence\
  \ in me. It was as if something deep inside me, my mind and soul would start awakening.\
  \ I started singing Native American songs, since it is said that the music and vibration\
  \ of the sound help the medicine to work even better. So while singing my first\
  \ vision came: three men, all with feathers on them were singing along with me.\
  \ They told me how thankful they were for me being there unfolding that which needed\
  \ to be dug out since long ago. Kept on singing with me a few songs and then vanished\
  \ like thin air. I had never been so thankful for that and what followed. Sky was\
  \ so full of stars, you could almost see more brightness than obscurity. All of\
  \ a sudden stars started moving together to form what appeared to be a train, one\
  \ made out of stars! It would literally come down all the way to me and a voice\
  \ would tell me - Come, come! - as an invitation to go onto the universe and its\
  \ infinite vastness. Visions would keep coming until something started calling me\
  \ in, so I closed my eyes and just let go off everything. Suddenly I found myself\
  \ right on the core of Mother Earth, where I was expelled after a while like hot\
  \ lava from a volcano and saw a bit of what the future might bring for humanity\
  \ if we keep up the raging non stopping pace of destruction and devastation  of\
  \ our sacred resources which we fully depend on. \n\n\tThis story I share with no\
  \ expectation at all, but merely to plant a seed on what sacred plants actually\
  \ do for humanity and how they can help us see what lies underneath each of us.\
  \ This I do with my heart, since it is literally, the only thing that I have. Thanks."
