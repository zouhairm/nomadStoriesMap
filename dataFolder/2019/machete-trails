Text: "My glasses were foggy from the tropical steam and warm sweat beads rolled down\
  \ my forehead and into my eyes. Between the two, I was basically walking through\
  \ the jungle blind.\n\n\u201CThis is the last uphill part!\u201D promised Silas\
  \ for the fourth time, raising his eyebrows and grinning ear-to-ear with red betel\
  \ nut stained teeth.\n\nAs we marched in a never-ending vertical line, I wondered\
  \ how a sixty-something-year-old friend of John\u2019s had hiked through the brutal\
  \ Solomon Islands jungle while my legs were quivering like a novice on stilts.\n\
  \n\u201CShe didn\u2019t,\u201D John casually announced. \u201CShe just helped Silas\
  \ make the pamphlet.\u201D \n\nThere was no turning back now. We were deep in the\
  \ unchartered wilderness of Malaita, an island 2,000 kilometres off the northeast\
  \ of Australia and a dot in the infinite Pacific Ocean. No reception. No internet.\
  \ We\u2019d be lucky to get a satellite phone signal if we\u2019d had one.\n\nWe\u2019\
  d started yesterday in Malaita\u2019s seaside capital, Auki, and planned to walk\
  \ across the mountainous island over three days to the east coast. \n\nOf course,\
  \ you could get there by sitting in a bumpy pick-up truck for five hours but where\
  \ was the fun in that? We wanted a real adventure.\n\nSo far we\u2019d survived\
  \ on a bag of peanuts and twice daily boiled cassava, a starchy potato that is a\
  \ staple of the local diet. The person who\u2019d never walked the walk assured\
  \ us we\u2019d be fed, but forgot that Solomon Islanders had the stamina of a rock\
  \ and made a habit of skipping lunch. \n\nSuddenly everybody paused. A muddy, bubbly\
  \ sludge was blocking our path. \n\nSilas sliced through an unassuming tree with\
  \ a machete, placed a round branch at our feet and leapt gracefully across. \n\n\
  Bec followed.\n\nHer right foot briefly teetered on the branch like a tightrope\
  \ walker before she was bathed in a mud body wrap that would\u2019ve set you back\
  \ $200 at home.\n\n\u201CAre you ok?\u201D I finally asked, catching my breath from\
  \ a mix of exhaustion and a cheeky laugh at Bec\u2019s expense.\n\nAs she turned\
  \ back to face her nemesis, a streak of crimson trickled down between her wavy blonde\
  \ hair.\n\nThe boys froze.\n\nI rummaged through my bag for a first aid kit, trying\
  \ not to let the panic slip out of my mind and onto my face.\n\nAs I cleaned a cut\
  \ the length of a dollar coin, the sound of our dwindling water rations pouring\
  \ over Bec\u2019s head stood out like a waterfall in the desert. We all knew there\
  \ was only one option and it was forward.\n\nA whiff of dried blood mixed with crepe\
  \ bandage lingered in my path as we soldiered on up the millionth hill since Silas\u2019\
  s last promise. \n\nSix hours away was Gwanafau, a village in a valley where grass\
  \ lines the paths and hut roofs are handcrafted from meticulously woven palm leaves.\
  \ \n\nThe adults giggled and whispered among themselves, asking why we didn\u2019\
  t just take the truck and gazing at Bec\u2019s gift-wrapped head with concern. \n\
  \nThe kids studied our worn out figures with bright, curious eyes. Then they ran\
  \ off, ransacked their family huts and emerged carrying colourful foam mattresses\
  \ on their shoulders. \n\nThe chief insisted and we accepted both his offer and\
  \ the call of aching muscles.\n\nPreparing for the night\u2019s serving of cassava,\
  \ John subtly probed if the chicken clucking around the central square had a price\
  \ on its head. \n\nA crowd quickly gathered to process the unorthodox request.\n\
  \nAbove, the Malaitan gods painted a clouded rhapsody on a sky canvas in colours\
  \ only known to the Pacific. By this time tomorrow - fuelled by boiled cassava or\
  \ an unsuspecting chicken - we\u2019d have crossed Malaita by foot and be swimming\
  \ in a Pacific postcard. We\u2019d come in search of that elusive thing we call\
  \ \u201Cadventure\u201D and maybe we\u2019d found it.\n\nAs the droning rhythm of\
  \ cicadas slowly faded, a woman carrying a large pot emerged from the shadows.\n\
  \nFor the first time since Bec\u2019s fall, Silas\u2019s grin reappeared and we\
  \ ate dinner in a sombre silence broken only by the sound of polished bones flinging\
  \ into a small metal bowl on the floor."
