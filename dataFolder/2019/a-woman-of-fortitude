Text: "I didn't expect to find myself that too on a bike in the middle of the highway\
  \ at night in Dubai. As an indian woman from a middle class background i have led\
  \ a sheltered life. Holidays and vacations have been with family and though i have\
  \ travelled for work it has mostly been with collwagues as that was our conpany\
  \ policy and never alone. \n2019 December is my 40th birthday and i decided to gift\
  \ myself a birthday present in advance by taking a solo trip to Dubai. Why Dubai\
  \ because it is one of the safest cities for women travellers and i wanted my first\
  \ solo trip to be without the added anxiety of safety. \nI had my itinerary planned\
  \ out in advance marking places i wanted to see and things i wanted to do. I landed\
  \ in Dubai in the afternoon and after a smooth entry into Dubai marvelling at the\
  \ efficiency of their immigration and customs departments i headed to my hotel.\
  \ I had selected a hotel in Deira, which is the centre of the city, mainly to have\
  \ faster access to all parts of Dubai. Also the lure of City Centre Mall which was\
  \ connected to my hotel was an added perk. After check in, and spending some time\
  \ relaxing in the hotel i decided to visit the Global Village. \nThe Global Village\
  \ as the name suggests is an amalgamation of cultures across the world. It is spread\
  \ across a huge expanse of land with every country having its own pavilion, showcasing\
  \ their monuments, food, products and culture. It transports you to a different\
  \ world. The tastes, the smell, the visuals all enchanting and enticing you as you\
  \ journey across lands. \nI had an amazing time there having tasted my way across\
  \ the Middle East traversing through Oman, Turkey,Saudi Arabia, Qatar, reaching\
  \ Europe, sailing to America and Africa and finally reaching my homeland India.\
  \ What a journey in a span of 5 hours. \nAs i left laden with things from all four\
  \ corners of the world i walked to the taxi stand. It was almost 10 pm and as i\
  \ walked a driver approached me asking if i wanted a cab. Seeing that i was alone\
  \ he suggested that i take a bike taxi a service which they had recently started\
  \ as it would be cheaper. Reluctantly i agreed to use the bike to head back to the\
  \ hotel. I got on the bike with trepidation but the rider made me comfortable. I\
  \ was given a helmet and a jacket as it was quite chilly. \nAs the ride began i\
  \ had a host of thoughts in my mind, about safety, about how foolish i was, what\
  \ if ghe rider was not legit and so on and so forth. Since morning i had not had\
  \ time to put a uae sim so did not have data or gps. This left me vulnerable in\
  \ my mind. \nBut as we rode on the highway, making our way through luxurious cars\
  \ under the starry sky, the wind pushing against us i began to let go. Let go of\
  \ worries, of thoughts, of everyday issues, and just enjoyed the sense of being,\
  \ of being there in that moment, enjoying the journey. As i looked up and saw the\
  \ stars in the sky, i realised how infinitely small we are and how much we have\
  \ to still explore. I felt my connection with the universe, the feeling of deep\
  \ bond to something beyond us. And in that i discovered myself. I discovered I was\
  \ strong enough to take care of myself if need be, smart enough to handle situations\
  \ as they arose and vulnerable enough that I never took unnecessary risks. By the\
  \ time i reached my hotel I had found myself, a woman first and foremost but one\
  \ with fortitude."
