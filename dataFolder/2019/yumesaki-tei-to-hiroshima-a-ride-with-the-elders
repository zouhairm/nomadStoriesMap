Text: "It was time for me to go. Five weeks before I had arrived in Yumesaki-tei,\
  \ a little country house in the province of Hyogo, Japan. This remote hosting place\
  \ was kept by three brothers, all in their fifty\u2019s, all of them crazy but in\
  \ a good way. \n\nThere was Kazu, the eldest, a real hippy. He would either be cooking\
  \ or smoking weed and jamming. Isao was the youngest. A serious man but when you\
  \ knew him better, he was the sweetest. And Nori was the quietest of them three.\
  \ His English was not as good as his brothers but he was very expressive and with\
  \ his funny mimicries he would always find a way to make us laugh.\n\nI had decided\
  \ to go only because I had so much more to see. I\u2019d decided it was today, but\
  \ had no plan. Maybe I would ask for a lift up to the nearest city, maybe I would\
  \ go on foot but I didn\u2019t know my destination. On the 5th of May, I would pack\
  \ my things and leave this little wooden hut that had become mine; the traditional\
  \ tatami, the thin mattress on the floor with the heating pad underneath, the Japanese\
  \ sliding door, the tokonoma where I had the habit to put fresh flowers every day,\
  \ the smell of incense, my own space. The huts were scattered in a garden of the\
  \ most traditional style. Each of us had its own. \n\nThere I had befriended people\
  \ from all over the world. We quickly became like a little community, and a much\
  \ eclectic one. All were here for a work exchange, housed and fed for a few hours\
  \ of work per week. Yumesaki-tei was in fact a restaurant and a guest house. We\
  \ would help in the kitchen, serve the tables, take care of the garden, do the cleaning,\
  \ and prepare the huts for our guests. \n\nThat day, contrary to the habit, we were\
  \ receiving a group of about twenty elderly people for dinner. In fact, we usually\
  \ never had any guest at all, or much too rarely. I can\u2019t tell how we used\
  \ to spend our time. But now a group of twenty people demanded a lot of preparation\
  \ and coordination. The boys decided to wear their best attire. Everybody was at\
  \ service and we had practiced before, using the few Japanese words we knew. \n\n\
  In the end the service went smoothly. After thanking us in the Japanese way, our\
  \ guests were headed back outside. That\u2019s when Kazu came to me and said they\
  \ had suggested taking me with them. They were ending their organized trip in Hiroshima,\
  \ the legendary. Then Hiroshima it would be. I was excited, I had to be fast. I\
  \ crossed the Japanese garden for the last time. I said goodbye to my hut, my home.\
  \ And then I followed the elders up to the bus where I was able to say goodbye to\
  \ my fellow comrades, not without dropping a tear. As soon as the bus took the road,\
  \ the man next to me, trying to catch my attention with hand signs, offered me a\
  \ piece of gum that I kindly accepted. Right after I felt a poke on my shoulder.\
  \ The woman behind was handing me some treats. Refusing a gift in Japan wasn\u2019\
  t well seen I had learned. How generous were they to offer me so much, I thought.\
  \ Maybe they had felt my sadness. I wanted to be able to talk to them, but I could\
  \ at least thank them. Arigato gosaimasu. The rest of the trip was like a procession\
  \ for a princess. They used the word \u2018\u2019chan\u2019\u2019 when referring\
  \ to me. Chan is used for female members of the family, and that\u2019s just how\
  \ I was feeling. Whenever we would stop driving for a pause, some more treats would\
  \ come to me. \n\nIt took many hours to reach Hiroshima and we had visited amazing\
  \ sites. At the end the day, the driver was dropping passengers home and very quickly\
  \ I was alone. The bus finally reached the center of the city and there I was: Me,\
  \ Hiroshima, a bag of Japanese treats and the most unusual experience to remember."
