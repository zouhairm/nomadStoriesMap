Text: "Hello, my name is Zhyldyz. I am 22 y.o. 7 months ago I made my first independent\
  \ trip to Amazing Turkey. Omg I really don\u2019t know how to express my thoughts\
  \ of experiences I\u2019ve got there! I have been having everything during these\
  \ 5 months of living there. Love, friendship, dangerous moments, have been crying,\
  \ was happy, anything you may have in your life at all. Actually I went to Turkey\
  \ to work, but this work covered numerous actions I\u2019ve done. I knew such kind\
  \ of thing, that I would get only 5-7 years after. We are with my colleagues were\
  \ working as a guide. We had been thought how to represent country\u2019s best sight\
  \ seeings. And we as a company worker had privilege to eat in same restaurant where\
  \ our tourists eat. But another things were forbidden for us. So I planned something\
  \ quickly. Before my shift I took my bag-pack with beachwear,sunglasses,towel. So\
  \ when I was \u201Cgreeting\u201D my tourists I insensibly went through reception\
  \ changed my uniform to what I had in my bag. So this day I spent with big pleasure.\
  \ I have Advanced Experience in traveling by hitch hiking. So once I caught 1 car,\
  \ driver pleasantly agreed and drove me to home, in the end he asked my number,\
  \ he was too old for me, that\u2019s why I took his number found in list some man\u2019\
  s number and changed his name into mine, then handed to driver. That was funny.\
  \ U know when you are in unfamiliar country everything is strange for you. But people\
  \ who live there surprisingly were very kind to me, once I was left without any\
  \ meal, so 1 of my turkish colleague offered me his meal. I was amazed. I really\
  \ want to cry when remember about my experience in Turkey, the beauties of nature\
  \ makes you be grateful,the huge power of nature makes you feel yourself as one\
  \ special element of space. I\u2019ve got lots of skills. Of course while I was\
  \ working as guide, I\u2019ve met over 2500 tourists for 5 months. I knew how to\
  \ speak with different people. I became a psychologist. Yes with adults I speak\
  \ as an adult, with children as a child. I\u2019ve faced with crazy situations.\
  \ You know In Turkey used to based, old time Greece, so Turkey was inherited their\
  \ architectures, and other wealth. I stepped to this place where used to was walking\
  \ gladiators, queens and king. This place had own power energy, so strange but I\
  \ cried there, I was feeling all the pain they felt. If you have chance you have\
  \ to visit this country, especially Antalya. So this is only 10% of my trip, I would\
  \ like to show more. Stay gorgeous<3 . the aim of this trip was to understand how\
  \ my mom earns money in order to give all her best. to find myself and make my space\
  \ to work on my dreams, i wanted to accept the challenge. i study in European faculty,\
  \ in other word i am future teacher of English  language. i wish i would the best\
  \ teacher for children, but i want to teach to amazing children with autism. discover\
  \ with them the best side of our World, of couse with the help of innovating devices.but\
  \ me-muself need more Eenglish talkinfg skills.and i will get it."
