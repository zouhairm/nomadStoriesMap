Text: "The further we walked into Munich's city center, the heavier the pit in my\
  \ stomach got. There was silence as we approached the crowds of eager tourists wandering\
  \ about the historic central square. I was essentially walking alongside a stranger.\
  \ Except, I had known this stranger from my childhood. Images of him crossed my\
  \ mind when I reminisced on my earliest memories. When my mother and I immigrated\
  \ to Canada, he was one of the numerous people I had to leave behind. As the years\
  \ went by, I indulged in flashbacks of my childhood, with him often being in the\
  \ background. His presence in my memories represented a yearning to go back to a\
  \ familiar place. \n\nFifteen years have passed since I left. Many things have changed,\
  \ but my memories of a distant childhood stayed the same. I held on to them like\
  \ a safety blanket. As long as I knew I was loved and happy at one point in my life,\
  \ the rest didn't matter. I was elated when my mom told me of the trip she had planned\
  \ to Munich to visit my former friend and his family. After all this time, I finally\
  \ felt like I could reunite with a pillar of my early childhood and discuss our\
  \ lives and all that has happened since knowing each other. When I arrived in Munich,\
  \ I was greeted by the summer heat and the smell of plastic radiating off the subway\
  \ underground. I trekked on, despite my eagerness now mixing with new found hesitation.\
  \ After my mother and I got off the train and entered the white apartment building\
  \ in which my elusive friend lived, we were greeted by two joyful adults. Their\
  \ son, the one I had been waiting for, followed. I tried to look calm and stoic,\
  \ I didn't want to give my excitement away. As I cautiously looked towards him,\
  \ I realized he was cautiously looking back. But not to hide his excitement, his\
  \ caution was one you would find when seeing a stranger entering your home. I could\
  \ not detect a trace of recognition in his eyes. Could he have forgotten about me?\
  \ As we engaged in small talk, I waited for the conversation to turn into the ravenous\
  \ banter I had envisioned. It did not. He did not remember. I was indeed a stranger.\
  \ I was left to feel nostalgic all by myself. To ease the tension of our conflicting\
  \ familiarity, we went for a walk.\n\nWe strolled through the residential neighborhoods\
  \ of Munich, towards our target of the city's tourism pinnacle. As we walked in\
  \ silence, I realized that time moves differently for everyone. He might have forgotten\
  \ me, but remembered others from his past. Our subconscious chooses what to remember.\
  \ Life moves forward, even if our memories stand still. My immigration turned my\
  \ brief encounters with this boy into precious pieces of a time capsule. I wanted\
  \ to preserve as much as I could of a life I felt I was taken away from. It took\
  \ going across the Atlantic for me to realize that you can only go forward. Replaying\
  \ memories from the past prevents you from enjoying the present. Walking along the\
  \ scorching pavement, I turned my attention to the old clock tower that stood in\
  \ the middle of the bustling square. As the clock struck 2 pm, I took a picture\
  \ to capture the beautiful moment."
