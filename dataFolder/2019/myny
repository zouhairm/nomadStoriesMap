Text: "The Tally Marks is my photographic project and a unary numerical system, in\
  \ which all the integers are represented exclusively by a single digit that also\
  \ represents the unit. A example could be the system used by prisoners to count\
  \ the days that separate them from freedom.\nThe Genesis speaks of seven days, seven\
  \ timelines in which everything can happen or where nothing can happen safely. Yet\
  \ they flow. \nFrom January to December. One story a month told in seven days.\n\
  Four months ago my ongoing project \u201CTALLY MARKS\u201D has continues with its\
  \ October series featuring seven pieces of a New York experience. \nIt\u2019s not\
  \ just a city, or a port, or a place that millions call home, this is the \u201C\
  caput mundi\u201D of cultural connection. Just as the Italians hold claim to the\
  \ cradle of the Renaissance, New York holds its own as the cradle of diverse culture.\
  \ The people are different in every step, in every moment, yet they coexist; side\
  \ by side on the subway, on a line one in front of the other, everywhere.\nThis\
  \ is my last week in the city and the last three weeks has seen my English improve\
  \ (maybe, I think) despite finding myself speechless in the first week. My efforts\
  \ have opened up different ways for me to use language, ways that incorporate customs\
  \ and lifestyles, and visceral ways to bring them into my work.\nThe colors of the\
  \ faces are different but in sync they defined a perfect rainbow of intrinsic diversity,\
  \ which lies within each of us.\nMy feature is that. Try to translate the emotions\
  \ through the words that I learned, with the only means that I have. I hope was\
  \ able to convert this vibes in good pictures.\nI want to represent seven different\
  \ joke, expression or simple words that have helped me these days. \nTuesday. Seven\
  \ days before departure.\n\"Like the trees' yearning for the jostling of their leaves\"\
  .\nThe literal translation of this sentence in Italian is \"\Lcome gli alberi desiderano\
  \ che le loro foglie si scontrino\". Indeed the definition of JOSTLE is: come in\
  \ contact or into collision; to make one's way by pushing and shoving (to find the\
  \ exit from all of this).\nThis word explains the expectations I had before leaving.\n\
  Wednesday. Six days before departure.\n\u201CLike the feeling of goosebumps trickling\
  \ down your neck.\u201D \u201CCome la sensazione di pelle d\u2019oca che gocciola\
  \ gi\xF9 per il collo\u201D. Goosebumps means literaly \u201Cpelle d\u2019oca\u201D\
  . Dizziness in the air, a strange pain of my knees on the Brooklyn Bridge.\nThursday.\
  \ Five days before departure.\n\u201CLike a goal that\u2019s a stone\u2019s throw\
  \ away.\u201D \u201CCome un obiettivo che \xE8 a un tiro di schioppo da qui\u201D\
  . The schioppo is the first hand cannon of the history. They come when you least\
  \ expect it, they are fast, they can kill you.\nFriday. Four days before departure.\n\
  \"Like casting longing eyes upon exhibitions of old\", literally \"Come lanciare\
  \ occhi nostalgici su esposizioni antiche\". Longing means wishing so much that\
  \ it almost fades. Side by side, one inside the other, in the circle line.\nSaturday.\
  \ Three days before departure.\n\"Like a throng of characters careening together\
  \ through a chorus of chaos\".\n\"Come una folla di personaggi che si accalcano\
  \ insieme per finire nel coro del caos\".\nThrong is a very special word. It isn't\
  \ just a synonymous of crowds, it is much more. Throng is like a community that\
  \ moves together, fighting for the same rights for a single wish. The freedom.\n\
  Sunday. Two days before departure. \n\"Like an overwhelming exuberance after toasting'down\
  \ the hatch'\", \"Come un' esuberanza travolgente dopo aver detto Alla Goccia!\"\
  .\nThis is for my far family!\nMonday. One day before departure.\n\xC8 doveroso\
  \ spiegare quest'ultima parola in italiano. WOP \xE8 un\u2019espressione denigratoria\
  \ che indica popolazioni europee (con particolare riferimento agli italiani) alle\
  \ quali sono attribuiti atteggiamenti spavaldi e violenti. \u201CWith Out Passports\u201D\
  , senza documenti appunto. Gli immigrati italiani erano infatti malvisti dalla popolazione\
  \ americana, esattamente come succede oggi in Italia nei confronti delle popolazioni\
  \ che raggiungono clandestinamente il nostro paese.\nQuesta parola conclude questa\
  \ mia esperienza, proprio per ricordare a ognuno di noi che abbiamo gli stessi problemi\
  \ e gli stessi desideri.\nIl cambiamento parte da lontano."
