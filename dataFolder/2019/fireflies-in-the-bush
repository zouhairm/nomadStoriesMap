Text: "It was summer in Africa, more than 10 years ago, specifically in Kenya, close\
  \ to Kilifi beach. It was my first time in the \u201CDark continent\u201D and I\
  \ was really excited about that idea, and also a bit scared. I had listen and read\
  \ to many times about the famous \u201CMal d'Africa\" as we call it in italian,\
  \ or Africa Blues that knowing a little bit my type of melancholic character I was\
  \ almost sure to get \u201Cinfected\u201D.\nI was guest in a friends house, and\
  \ since the first day I\u2019ve noticed the constant presence of two person: Nieto\
  \ and Moses. Nieto is an amazing woman, with one of the humble smile I ever see\
  \ in my life, Moses is a young man, incredibly strong, as only african can be, full\
  \ of life and hopeful about his future. They are the helper in the house were we\
  \ stay, but actually helper is not the correct word to use. I will say the column,\
  \ they help the family but also share their knowledge and their way of life. With\
  \ them in the house is not only being a tourist in Kenya but is a share of experience\
  \ and culture. From how to cook delicious biscuits to how easily jump up on a tree\
  \ palm to catch a fresh coconut with a machete. To comment I am still stuck at the\
  \ theory! Moses is saving money to build a house close to the family where I am\
  \ staying and then get married and start a family with his girlfriend, Nieto that\
  \ is older than him, has already her family and she wants to keep living in the\
  \ bush. That actually consist in hundreds of mud houses not along the coast but\
  \ in the inside of the country. Is half an hour far from the place where she works\
  \ but is where she lives, where she grew up and even if it is not apparently nice\
  \ as living in a better house by the sea, her roots are there and she doesn\u2019\
  t want to change. For that reason every night someone of my friends family bring\
  \ back Nieto to her house. Even if the communication between us was not that articulated\
  \ and deep there was something in her that capture me, so the second night I was\
  \ there I asked at the member of the family that was in charge of that to do the\
  \ trip with them. It was a perfect evening, one of those moment in which every physical\
  \ and climatic component seems to have a proper life and importance. The slight\
  \ fresh breeze that was blowing, the color of the dusk, the dust of the road floating\
  \ inside the car, everything was there to make the view from the car window stuck\
  \ in my eyes. Between improvised football arenas there were dozens of little mud\
  \ houses that you can notice only because of the light of the candle was lit up.\
  \ The people inside of those little houses were cooking, singing, smiling, talking,\
  \ in short simply living but for me was looking at something holy. Since my childhood\
  \ I have always been fascineted from the view through the house window in the night,\
  \ and there in the middle of a dusty road in Africa, accompanying an african woman\
  \ proud of the place where she lives, even if most of the people I know will probably\
  \ won\u2019t live there I have been invaded of the willing to live with them. Peace\
  \ was in me. The simple life of which I was only a temporary spectator made me feel\
  \ more than ever the development as a knife. The feelings I felt made me decide\
  \ to be the companion of the Nieto\u2019s companion, and each night, for 20 unforgattable\
  \ days I had the gift to see the country side of a little part of Kenya going to\
  \ sleep. I don\u2019t want to compare places in the world, this is not my aim, I\u2019\
  m only trying to share one of the peaceful and magical experience of my life and\
  \ make you think which is yours and why it is. Life at candle light like fireflies\
  \ in the bush."
