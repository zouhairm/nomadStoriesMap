Text: "We were dropped off in a beautiful green clearing. There were meadows for miles,\
  \ and you could just make out the ocean on the horizon. The sun was setting and\
  \ we only had the clothes on our backs; we had signed up for this.\n\nThe three\
  \ of us started gathering lumber as we made our way past the waterfall, constructing\
  \ tools out of wood and stone to pry ourselves a shelter into the cliff side. Together\
  \ in darkness, wishing we had found flint in time, we huddled together as the sounds\
  \ of the night rang out beyond our walls. \n\nAs daylight scattered across the flowery\
  \ fields, we emerged and gathered more supplies. Coal and wood was used to make\
  \ all of us torches. A small trunk made from wood to store supplies. Wooden boats,\
  \ for the next step.\n\nThis time as night gathered we found ourselves in a shelter\
  \ filled with torchlight and warm furnaces smelting the day\u2019s iron. Cries of\
  \ beasts and unknown dangers echoed faintly in the distance. \u201CTomorrow, we\
  \ go in search of another island.\u201D\n\nWhen the sun rose we threw explorers\
  \ carried our boats to the shore, and paddled out into the turquoise waters. The\
  \ sound of the water slapping our oars as the songs of seagulls filled the salty\
  \ air was someone calming, despite the danger. If we die, we lose everything, and\
  \ start over from the next spawn point.\n\nThis is Minecraft on Survival Mode."
