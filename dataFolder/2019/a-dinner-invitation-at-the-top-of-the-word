Text: "The best restaurant in Rio de Janeiro is located in someone\u2019s backyard,\
  \ on top of one of the city\u2019s famous morros, or hills. As day drips into night,\
  \ the lights of the city illuminate the sea, and you can see beyond the houses lit\
  \ up like stars all the way to the bay, as though Yemoja herself, the Yoruban goddess\
  \ of the sea, is winking at you. \n\nAs pitchers of fruit juice were passed around\
  \ the table, and our hosts piled our plates high with rice, beans, farofa, and stew,\
  \ the sounds of the favela rose as the sun set. Somewhere down the road, someone\
  \ started blasting a baile funke song, and childrens footsteps were followed by\
  \ puppies barking. We were high up in Rocinha, South America\u2019s largest favela,\
  \ in a neighborhood called Roupa Suja - literally, dirty clothes. Rocinha\u2019\
  s infamous history of violence, and subsequent municipal response, created zones\
  \ within the mountainside community. While some Rocinha neighborhoods, like where\
  \ I lived in Vila Verde, were relatively calm, home to public housing and basketball\
  \ courts, others like Roupa Suja suffered from even further neglect and marginalization.\
  \ While my neighbors children walked home from school in uniforms, more than one\
  \ teenager I saw on our walk up to Roupa Suja carried a weapon in his waistband.\
  \ Still, the neighborhood carried the same characteristics I had come to appreciate\
  \ all over Rio de Janeiro: people who lived out loud. Everywhere we turned, people\
  \ were sitting on stoops, chatting on corners, and laughing with the cashier at\
  \ the corner store. They had infused a place that had known so much death with life\
  \ and vitality. Gentileza gera gentileza. I didn\u2019t take it for granted that\
  \ this invitation to dinner took me to a part of the favela rarely visited by foreigners.\
  \ I smiled at everyone I saw with a friendly \u201Ctudo bem?\u201D, as the Cariocas\
  \ do. \n\nSeu Jo\xE3o spent his career cooking in kitchens in the city's wealthy\
  \ South Zone, and trudging home to Rocinha at the end of each day. His wife, children,\
  \ chickens, and strays (both children and puppies alike!) crowd through his home\
  \ on any given night. Now older, he has decided to open his home to tourists to\
  \ give them a literal taste of the real Rio. He started with us: a group of volunteers\
  \ from all over the world who had been living and working throughout the favela\
  \ for several nights. In spirited Portuguese, he introduced us to his children,\
  \ who grinned before running off again. Some of the older ones joined us at the\
  \ table, as he told us stories about Rocinha when he was young. We shared anecdotes\
  \ from our jobs, told him what we loved about his city, and asked about his cooking\
  \ as day turned to night. Any unease I had felt about traipsing up to this neighborhood\
  \ faded away. Seu Jo\xE3o offered us some more of the famous Brazilian farofa to\
  \ spruce up our dinner, using food in the best way he knew how: to build relationships.\
  \ \n\nWhen I decided to leave Brooklyn for Brazil, I knew I wanted to work in a\
  \ favela, after having visited several favelas some years prior. I was impressed\
  \ by the ingenuity I had seen there, and intrigued by these informal mountainside\
  \ communities, went back to learn more. When I first stood on the pasarela connecting\
  \ Rocinha to neighboring Sao Conrado, I was speechless at the scale of her, the\
  \ sheer magnitude of humanity I knew lay beyond that wall of colorful houses. At\
  \ first her streets were too hectic for me, her nights too loud. Over time, Rocinha\
  \ became my greatest teacher, a raucous, roiling place in the eye of the hurricane\
  \ that can be Rio de Janeiro. Beyond Ipanema\u2019s famous beaches, and the shady\
  \ sanctuary in Parque Lague, Rocinha became the place I was proud to come home to.\
  \ Through midnight samba lesson at the boteco down the road, an impromptu invitation\
  \ to the elaborate birthday celebration of my co-worker\u2019s child, or a dinner\
  \ party at the top of the world, she was always showing me what lay on the other\
  \ side of \u201Ccomfortable\u201D."
