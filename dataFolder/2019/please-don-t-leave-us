Text: "It was one of those burning hot days. One of those mornings on which you wake\
  \ up with a feeling that this day will go differently than planned. Yes, quite differently.\
  \ It is Burundi, 2015. Before, Burundi had beautiful, wide-spread green hills that\
  \ felt peaceful. National dances and drum ceremonies that felt bonding. Now, soldiers\
  \ are deserting the army and tension is electrifying the air. The president refuses\
  \ to leave office, conflict is rising and the country is on the brink of falling\
  \ back into genocide. A conflict that later murdered hundreds of its own people\
  \ - and these are only the official numbers.\n\nThe jeep is waiting outside our\
  \ gate to drop me and Samantha, my Dutch colleague, off at the office. We used to\
  \ ride our own scooter to work, but that\u2019s no longer an option. We enter the\
  \ jeep with a feeling of unease, which has become the norm throughout these past\
  \ few weeks. One moment of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and we could\
  \ lose our lives. Lose our lives, just like all those innocent, kind-hearted people\
  \ who did nothing wrong other than being born in the wrong country and with the\
  \ \u2018wrong\u2019 ethnicity. Tutsis are regarded as scum. Pure scum. They are\
  \ pointed at for everything that goes wrong in the country. Life is unfair.\n\n\
  As we enter the office we are \u2018welcomed\u2019 by the news from the past night.\
  \ It has become routine to share all security-related information and incidents\
  \ before the morning coffee. \n\n\u201CThey came to my neighbours last night!\u201D\
  \ shrieks Goulous, our cleaning lady. \u201CI heard everything! The children were\
  \ crying so loud! There were so many shots fired! I heard they beheaded the children,\
  \ with machetes! In front of their parents\u2019 eyes! What should we do?! We can\u2019\
  t stay here! It is not safe!!!\u201D We all rush in to hug and console her. Assuring\
  \ her that everything is going to be okay. It will, right? It has to be! We are\
  \ trying to convince ourselves that we are safe, whilst doubt and fear are rising\
  \ in the back of our minds. Every night whole families are brutally raped and murdered.\
  \ Every day the news is getting worse. This is terrifying. The violence is reaching\
  \ us so near, we are becoming more enclosed by it with every day that passes. We\
  \ can\u2019t be more grateful that we are all still alive. Alive, though not very\
  \ safe nor sound anymore. With all these violent outbursts sprouting to our left\
  \ and right, all we can do is hope that we will all make it to the next day. \n\n\
  Would it be safer to stay together and hibernate at the office? We\u2019re in deep\
  \ discussion. Our local colleagues prefer going back to their families at home,\
  \ and thus Samantha and I end up going back home as well. We hear the guns rattling\
  \ outside. The darker the night falls, the stronger the sounds become. We try to\
  \ fall asleep. After numerous sleepless nights spent listening to the sounds of\
  \ guns and grenades, and obsessing about the horrific scenarios of what could happen,\
  \ our psyche is slowly adapting to the new \u2018normal\u2019. Exhausted, we fall\
  \ into dreams full of violence and fear...\n\nThe next morning, our country director\
  \ tells us he made a decision. We have to join the evacuation of expats. Go back\
  \ to Europe. Stay there until the conflict winds down. We\u2019re not able to do\
  \ our work right now, and it\u2019s not safe. Our local colleagues start crying.\
  \ \u201CNo! Please don\u2019t leave us here! No!!!\u201D Goulous clamps my arm.\
  \ She is crying uncontrollably. \n\nWhy do I deserve to be rescued and Goulous and\
  \ the others don\u2019t? Why is my life more important than theirs? Torn, I scramble\
  \ to pack my bags and we rush to the airport. My mind and body are full of mixed\
  \ thoughts and feelings - relief for my safety, and fear of what may happen when\
  \ I\u2019m gone. \n\nThe privilege of the white people. I\u2019m still hearing Goulous\u2019\
  \ screaming voice in my head while our plane is taking off."
