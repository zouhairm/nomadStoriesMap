Text: "\u201CUh, hello....?  Is anybody there?\u201D\n\nI knocked timidly on the hull\
  \ of the sailboat. \n\n\u201CHello....?\u201D\n\nNo answer. \n\nOh, boy. \n\nI was\
  \ on a very small island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, knocking on a boat\
  \ I was banking on for my getaway vehicle.  There was a need to escape quickly because\
  \ there was a local woman who was hoping I\u2019d marry her oldest son.  By \u2018\
  hoping\u2019 I mean, she was waiting for me in the parking lot so that we could\
  \ go to the town hall and write up the marriage papers- whether I liked it or not.\
  \ \n\nHow did I get here?\n\nMore importantly, how was I going to get out of here?\n\
  \nThe sailing season was ending soon, and if I didn\u2019t hurry up and get a ride\
  \ out of town, I would end up stuck here for the winter. \n\nShuffling down the\
  \ dock, I tried to come up with a backup plan. \n\nGoing over my options, it was\
  \ clear that jumping back onto the boat I had sailed in on was out of the question.\
  \  I had hitched a ride south from Honolulu with them, and after twenty days at\
  \ sea on a boat with a bucket for a toilet, I was ready for a change. \n\n\u201C\
  Excuse me, hello?\u201D\n\nMy heart jumped when I heard an older man\u2019s voice\
  \ call out. The accent was proper, well-bred, and Australian.  My own New Jersey\
  \ accent sounded harsh and abrasive in comparison. \n\n\u201COh yeah!  Hi!\u201D\
  \n\nWithout questioning my intentions, he invited me in for tea. \n\nMichael and\
  \ I exchanged our stories, briefly giving an overview of the paths that led each\
  \ of us to this far-flung corner of the world. \n\nHe went first, explaining why\
  \ he was here (tsunami delayed his plans) and why he was alone (family returned\
  \ to Australia this morning; wife gets sea sick). He went over his planned route\
  \ for the next couple of months; it was a long list of places I\u2019d never heard\
  \ of- places that looked like crumbs that had spilled on the chart of the vast Pacific\
  \ Ocean. \n\nI gave a brief overview of my situation and tried to downplay my desperation:\
  \ recent university graduate (read: broke, but with a degree!), working on a farm\
  \ in Hawaii (read: still broke), hitched a couple of rides on different sailboats\
  \ that scared me (read: broke and making poor life choices). I met a local family\
  \ and now they\u2019re trying to keep me.  At this point, I\u2019ll go anywhere.\
  \ \n\nMichael sipped his tea calmly, and paused. \n\n\u201CI leave tomorrow,\u201D\
  \ he said. \n\n\u201CUhh okay...\u201D I was confused. What did this mean?\n\n\u201C\
  If you want to come, I have some errands that I need to run first.\u201D\n\nHesitating,\
  \ I looked around the cozy, wood-paneled interior of the fifty-foot sailboat.  The\
  \ bulkheads were lined with plaques from trans-Atlantic races and yacht rallies\
  \ that Michael had successfully completed.  Everything inside was tidy and well-kept.\
  \  On the chart table, there was a guest book of past crew who had sailed onboard.\
  \  The entries raved about Michael\u2019s seamanship, and also teased him ruthlessly.\
  \  For an Australian, if someone isn\u2019t making fun of you, it means they don\u2019\
  t like you.\n\nThe reluctance and doubt disappeared.\n\nOn that morning, I thought\
  \ about my almost-future-mother-in-law waiting for me outside the marina... and\
  \ said yes.\n\nWithin two days we would be calling into nearby Swains Island, an\
  \ atoll with a population of four people. Next, was the uninhabited Manra, where\
  \ I nearly lost my life when wandering into quicksand-esque lagoon in the island\u2019\
  s interior.  And then was a month spent on Kiribati\u2019s Canton Island.  The island\u2019\
  s population of thirty lived in houses that used to be occupied by American soldiers\
  \ during WWII. \n\nOver the next two years, Michael and I would sail thousands of\
  \ miles, and even as we went around Cape Horn, the topic of conversation remained....\n\
  \n\u201CWhat do you think ever happened to your almost-future-mother-in-law?\u201D"
