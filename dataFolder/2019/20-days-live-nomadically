Text: "20 days \"get lost\" explore Surabaya,  Madura,  Kangean,  and Bali. I found\
  \ so many beautiful thing in my solo trip.  Learn the culture,  visit some small\
  \ island around Kangean, take a closer look at the lives of coastal communities,\
  \ live in with Bajau tribe, meets lots of nice people,  and so forth.\n\nStart from\
  \ Jakarta,  used train towards Surabaya and then stay for 5 days.  Went around till\
  \ corner of city used electric bycycle and tried West Java cruisine. So happy! \n\
  \nHigh wave and bad weather hit Madura waters while I was in Surabaya.  6th days,\
  \  i decided went to Madura from Surabaya used the bus because I got message that\
  \ there was a ship which sailed towards Kangean Island as my next destination after\
  \ bad  weather and high waves subside. Took a ride small ferry,  so lucky, everything\
  \ was good. \n\nIn Kangean,  I stayed with a family who is  indigenous villager\
  \ for 6 days. Everyday I eats fish, tried sea grape,  visit some small island around\
  \ it,  playing on the beach, snorkling,  help a fisherman was drying fish and other\
  \ fun things. \n\nNext,  I took a ride big ship in the middle of the night towards\
  \ Sapeken island. I couldn't  sleep because deck is like barack with bad smell.\
  \  Finally,  I was sleep on outer deck of the ship with many people who also sleep\
  \ hit by the sea breeze. \n\nIn Sapeken island,  I live with a Bajau tribe Family\
  \ for a day.   I saw the way of their eat.  They will pour mineral water in their\
  \ rice, and the side dishes are grilled fish and Bajau sambal,  namely water sambal\
  \ consist of just a litlle chilly,  salt,  lime and 50ml water.  Yummyy!!  So fresh.\
  \ They accompanied me to visit some small island around Sapeken used Sampan,  small\
  \ motorized boat. \n\nThere is make me hurt,  that coastal community throw away\
  \ their garbage to he sea.  A big problem for marine division of Indonesia government.\
  \  There is no solving garbage problem for they who live in small island besides\
  \ throwing it away to the sea. \n\nFrom Sapeken to the Banyuwangi towards Bali as\
  \ my final destination in 13th days,  I used a ferry again.  there was not much\
  \ I could do in Bali because limited budget. For 7 days, always lunch in a simple\
  \ coffee shop nuances of Bali while reading books which their library, see their\
  \ garden,  and talking to each other in there. \n\nIn this my solo trip, I avoid\
  \ getting on a plane  except when I went back to the Jakarta. From that way,  I\
  \ got many wonderful experienced. I really want to do this again abroad, and write\
  \ it to share to useful for the other people.  \n\n20 days live nomadically in my\
  \ own country is  a valuable lesson that I can apply if one day I have the opportunity\
  \ to live nomadically overseas as well."
