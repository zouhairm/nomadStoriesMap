Text: "Driving along a Nevada highway in a rented Versa, I sit amazed at the scenery\
  \ staring back at me. Astonished for a moment, I reflect on how I have ended up\
  \ here.\n\nA mistake, a bit of a miscalculation really (and if you are as 'dimensionally-challenged'\
  \ as I am then 77 miles would be a \u2018tiny\u2019 miscalculation), and a subsequent\
  \ two-and-a-half hour shuttle ride had led to staggering clarity: it was time. Years\
  \ of deferring to practicality, logic and planning, had culminated in an unanticipated\
  \ moment of acceptance that it was time to embark on that world discovery tour I\
  \ had mentally devised over the past decade. No more calculating or hoping, just\
  \ doing.\n\nSo here I am, driving along highway 160 to a place, the name of which\
  \ rarely inspires wanderlust: Death Valley. My first road-trip on this journey of\
  \ discovery finds me leaving the high-rises of Vegas behind with their mating calls\
  \ of frivolity, \u2018must-see\u2019 entertainment and bright billboard signs. Rolling\
  \ through the Nevada desert landscape with its unexpected and sudden interpolation\
  \ of greenery, thrown in like pixie dust to give it a semblance of a scenic landscape,\
  \ I nervously maneuver the twisting lanes, hidden curves and constantly narrowing\
  \ highway as it winds upwards. An encroaching anxiety manifests itself as city markers\
  \ and signs of life disappear in my rear-view mirror with nothing but solitary highway\
  \ looming ahead.\n\nAn-hour-in-eternity-years later, leery but relieved, the highway\
  \ opens into a vast panorama of bare mountainous terrain. The vividly blue skies,\
  \ across which wispy strands of white clouds lazily cruise, spread as far as my\
  \ gaze can wander without veering from my lane. Along the way, spurts of local traffic\
  \ from quaint western towns, strewn across the expansive terrain like charming outposts,\
  \ intermingle with stretches of empty highway. The renewed enthusiasm and burgeoning\
  \ confidence in the venture occasioned by the change in scenery, is short lived.\n\
  \nI had read up on the trek to Death Valley. The many cautions and intimidating\
  \ tales of tourists getting lost and sadly, some even dying in the remote conditions,\
  \ had been duly noted and heeded. Printed directions in the event of a Google map\
  \ outage were safely tucked in the glove box of the car and at least two days\u2019\
  \ worth of water and food was occupying the back seat. However, the last leg of\
  \ the drive on a lone two-lane road surrounded by miles of white gravel and uninhabited\
  \ territory is unnerving. A sense of dread creeps up on me and I am questioning\
  \ my breakfast choice of pancakes as an appropriate last meal.\n\nIn my musings\
  \ I round a bend. A majestic scene unfolds, excites, and all trepidation disappears\
  \ instantly. A kaleidoscope of brown, bronze, copper, auburn, and taupe folds flows\
  \ across a commanding mountainous landscape. Zabriskie Point, my first stop in Death\
  \ Valley presents an arrangement of rolling mountains in colors and patterns reminiscent\
  \ of a master artist\u2019s painting, creatively displayed on a soothing blue canvas\
  \ with a whimsical white backdrop.\n\nIn stark contrast, my next stop, the below-sea-level\
  \ Badwater basin, seems like a desolate, flat version of an infinity pool sprinkled\
  \ with salted snowflakes. Despite its stark nature there is serenity to the quietness\
  \ of it; an arresting beauty to its emptiness and surrounding, equally bare, mountain\
  \ range. The solitude of the landscape lends itself to a peaceful moment and contemplation\
  \ of the steps yet to be taken on my unfurling journey. Still marveling at its expansive\
  \ white floor, I make my way to the final stop of the day.\n\nCoasting along Artist\
  \ Drive I am enchanted with the many nooks that sneak up on me as nine miles of\
  \ curvy road makes its way through canyons and mountains. Purples, pinks, greens\
  \ and yellows \u2018dusted\u2019 on brown, chocolate and beige are the most surprising\
  \ and elegant minimalist decor I have seen on a mountain range. This section of\
  \ the drive, appropriately named Artist Palette, is the closing event in a day of\
  \ ambivalent emotions.\n\nEnthralled I leave Death Valley, taking a last glance\
  \ in my rear-view mirror of its remote beauty and I can\u2019t help but wonder what\
  \ other serendipitous encounters lie ahead."
