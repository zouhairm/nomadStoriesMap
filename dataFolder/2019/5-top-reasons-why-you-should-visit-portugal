Text: "Portugal is known for historic cities, world-renowned cuisine, natural landscapes,\
  \ and some of the world\u2019s most spectacular beaches! \n\nHang on because here\
  \ are the 5 top reasons of why you should visit Portugal. Keep on reading...\n\n\
  Best for Its Beaches\n\nThe Algarve, in the south of Portugal, is famous for its\
  \ stunning beaches . There are 150 and spectacular waves. Steer clear of the crowded\
  \ south coast and head west to the less developed part of the Algarve where huge\
  \ Atlantic rollers make for awesome surfing for experts and beginners alike. Praia\
  \ do Amado, on the Costa Vicentina, is Portugal\u2019s best-known surfing beach.\n\
  \nCastles Have Their Own Beauty\n\nNot far from Lisbon, on the central western Portuguese\
  \ coast, are the forested hilltops and opulent castles and palaces of Sintra. The\
  \ most fantastical of these is the gloriously decadent, colorful and eclectically\
  \ styled Pal\xE1cio da Pena. The palace was built in the 19th century for Ferdinand\
  \ II as the summer residence of the Portuguese royal family and is still used for\
  \ state occasions. One of the Seven Wonders of Portugal, its 19th-century Romantic\
  \ architecture is a Gothic, Moorish and Renaissance mash-up. \n\nGo Hiking\n\n\n\
  Go hiking or climbing in the rugged mountainous landscape of the Parque Natural\
  \ da Serra da Estrela in the center of Portugal. It\u2019s Portugal\u2019s largest\
  \ protected area of countryside more than 1,000sqm of rock-strewn meadows, gushing\
  \ rivers and waterfalls, forested slopes, terraced fields and icy lakes where you\u2019\
  ll find Portugal\u2019s highest peak, tower at 1,993m.\n\nBecome a Party Animal\n\
  \nPorto is Portugal\u2019s second city and a colorful mix of medieval relics, extravagant\
  \ churches, and Beaux Arts buildings and a lively music scene. The Cais da Ribeira\
  \ riverfront is the heart of the city: tall old buildings made from granite and\
  \ tile line the river front, narrow streets lie behind and Roman ruins lie underneath.\
  \ There are loads of wine caves open for tastings. It\u2019s not all port and historic\
  \ buildings though the city attracts the world\u2019s best rock, electro and jazz\
  \ musicians.\n\nOpt for Train To Explore the Streets of Portugal\n\nThe capital\
  \ of Portugal has it all: a stunning hilltop location on the river Tegus, magnificent\
  \ plazas, icing-sugar cathedrals and the cobbled alleyways of the old Moorish Alfama\
  \ quarter. Visit the vast waterfront mosaic square Pra\xE7a do Com\xE9rcio (commerce\
  \ square) surrounded on three sides by 18th-century arcades and ornate facades.\
  \ Don\u2019t miss the Mosterio dos Jer\xF3nimos, a honey-colored stone confection\
  \ of arches, pillars, columns and turrets and where you\u2019ll find the body of\
  \ one of Portugal\u2019s most famous sons, explorer Vasco de Gama. Also, must their\
  \ dessert menu and other wines, the valley of the river Douro, especially the Alto\
  \ (upper) Douro, has a spectacular landscape of unbelievably steep hillsides covered\
  \ with vines and, here and there, wine-producing farms called quintas. \n\nSo, these\
  \ were the top 5 reasons to visit Portugal. Go and grab the tickets and tell us\
  \ in the comments section what are the things you liked the most about  Portugal."
