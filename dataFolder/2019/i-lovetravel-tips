Text: "The planning of  the  trip to Venice to Rome, Italy took just a few months\
  \ to plan and it came with many warnings from everyone about how many people were\
  \ out there to pick my pockets and take things from me if I was not careful.  One\
  \ purchase was an anti-theft purse and I was on way to prove them wrong and that\
  \ even though I was kind of unorganized most of the time, I could travel unscathed.\n\
  \     On the plane, I discovered I had misplaced my carefully typed itinerary and\
  \ my newly purchased sunglasses. Luckily, I had snapped a picture of my itinerary\
  \ so all was not lost. A layover in Istanbul was where I found my case with my Visa\
  \ credit card and a hairbrush had been misplaced or more accurately gone. I am an\
  \ avid travel story reader so I had divided up my credit cards and  assets as a\
  \ precaution and in this case, it really was a worthwhile tip!                 \
  \                                                                              \
  \                                                                              \
  \                                                                         The plane\
  \ landed at Marco Polo airport and as I gathered up all of tablet, carry-on and\
  \ other important items, somewhere my carefully picked out travel scarf was missing.\
  \ Oh, humbug! As I stood in line at Customs to call my bank in my small town to\
  \ cancel my Visa card, it occurred to me that I did not have to worry about my stuff\
  \ being taken by rogues, I preferred losing it myself."
