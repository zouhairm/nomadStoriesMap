Text: This was a small, sapphire city set about with citrus trees but worth a visit
  for the food, casinos, shopping and friendly people. The dark green horizon of the
  Mediterranean, flat and murky in the winter months reminded me of the eternal nothingness
  that I would  meet one day. Intense, high mountains hug the town. White homes clinging
  to the mountain sides like broken oysters shone in the sunrise.  Beautifully tender,
  salty calamari, the best I have ever eaten in this lifetime, can be found along
  the seaside near Lapta.   All this and more at a quarter of the cost of the same
  in Australia.  I felt safe enough to catch the local buses when I had worked out
  what to say in broken Turkish. The people smiled and waved if you made the first
  gesture and the call the prayer waking the neighborhood like the first crowing rooster,
  felt strangely comforting. Once, alarming the birds at 5:30am and then again about
  7:30 just in case you slept through. Not all of Cyprus, not the Greek side, not
  the quaint mountain villages or the nature parks, but the growing town of Girne
  on the coast. You must go, you must spend your money, you must avoid the high season
  but go-you won't be disappointed.
