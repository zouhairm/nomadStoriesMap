Text: "We had been travelling in a small, somewhat rickety minivan for at least 3\
  \ hours, and we were watching the sun start to go down from behind the dusty windows,\
  \ which cast an orange glow across us. We had spent the past 10 days doing long\
  \ days of travel, cramming ourselves into public buses and coaches, so whilst another\
  \ long journey wasn't exactly liked, we relished being able to stretch out with\
  \ a row each to ourselves.\n\nOn a long stretch of road with shanty-style houses\
  \ either side, our driver pulled up to a small petrol station to refuel, which gave\
  \ us a chance to stretch our legs. Whilst we were wandering, we could smell the\
  \ most amazing food - meaty, spicy and so, so tempting. It was almost comical how\
  \ we followed our noses, as if we were a cartoon character, until we came across\
  \ a roadside barbecue where local women were cooking what looked like the carcass\
  \ of a cow over a rather scrappy fire, made out of a few pieces of large coal and\
  \ scrap metal. As soon as we approached, one of the younger women, in a plain black\
  \ dress and flip flops, smiled at us and called us over in Khmer, where after a\
  \ sharp bark to one of the older men in the back who looked like he was sleeping\
  \ in a slumped position over his camping chair, immediately started to pull out\
  \ cans of Angkor beer from huge white cooler that at first, looked like a refrigerator\
  \ lying on it's side and bringing them over to us in a plastic bag each, before\
  \ retiring back to his chair.\n\nWe only had a few words of Khmer that we'd learned\
  \ between us, and even though much of the country spoke very good English, we never\
  \ expected them to be able to understand us, so we communicated mostly by crude\
  \ sign language to each other. There was a small red radio on the side, which one\
  \ of the women turned on. It started with Khmer popular music which we had never\
  \ heard, but because we were primarily westerners, they quickly turned the channel,\
  \ tuning through the various static noises until, of all people, Katy Perry started\
  \ to break through what was now turning into nighttime. The driver had long ago\
  \ filled the minivan up, and had come over to grab a beer (the drinking laws seemed\
  \ to be more lax in the rural parts of Cambodia!), along with some form of mystery\
  \ clear drink in a plastic bottle, and chat with the men in the back. Our guide,\
  \ who had been in the back talking with the same men that the driver was talking\
  \ to, came over to us to join in with eating the delicious barbecued meat, which\
  \ was coated with so many spices and complex flavours, that all I remember about\
  \ the taste is that I couldn't get enough of it! The carcass was by now, just bones\
  \ suspended over the fire, and the woman who first called us over, which we learned\
  \ her name was Chanra after me mistakenly calling her Sandra multiple times, started\
  \ to dance with who we thought was her husband, who had a rather red face from drinking\
  \ the \"mystery liquid\" from the back and stumbling around her, all whilst we laughed\
  \ with them. \n\nAfter at least an extra twenty minutes of chatting with them via\
  \ our guide, eating and drinking, we begrudgingly left them (still drinking and\
  \ dancing) to get back onto the dusty minivan. It was only another hour or two until\
  \ we got to the border to cross into Vietnam, but I found myself wishing we could\
  \ stay longer. Whilst Cambodia certainly isn't the richest country in the world,\
  \ nor has it had the most peaceful past, but the people of the country have been\
  \ some of the kindest, most welcoming, that I have ever experienced, and the people\
  \ are the reason Cambodia will always have a piece of my heart, and as we drove\
  \ past the group, still dancing around the slowly dying fire underneath the makeshift\
  \ corrugated metal shelter, a piece of my heart would always stay with them too."
