Text: "Growing up a pastor's son was not easy.  All I just wanted, was to use the\
  \ camera I use at church, to take picture.\n\nTravel, food, art, people, landscape,\
  \ fashion, photography gets me excited but having two conservative religious parents\
  \ is challenging. They do not approve of anything! The expectation of others compelled\
  \ me to always play safe and not take risks earlier on in life. \n\nExperiential\
  \ traveling like a local has been a burning desire for me for a long time. I wanted\
  \ to take the road less traveled, instead of sticking to recommendations and guidebooks,\
  \ connect with locals and experience a life completely different from mine. I withdrew\
  \ all my savings and visited Mozambique. \n\nI went with the mindset that seeing\
  \ a show instead of visiting a well-known attraction will put me in the company\
  \ of locals. I rented a room on Airbnb at Matanyane guest house. It is in a township\
  \ situated just a few minutes out of Maputo center. It has a chilled lively atmosphere,\
  \ it gives you a nice insight into the life of locals and it's located close to\
  \ the beach, airport & local markets.\n\nI met up with Matanyane, the irrepressible\
  \ master of ceremonies. He immediately makes you feel at home, he is friendly, warm,\
  \ and kind. A truly unique experience I have never felt. Since I was in a township,\
  \ I definitely let go of any expectations of modernity and luxury. What really impressed\
  \ me was that everything is clean and well kept, and you soon figure out your way.\
  \ \n\nExploring inner Maputo\n\nThe next morning, Mata the host, offered a bike\
  \ tour through Maputo \"it\u2019s a really nice way to explore the city early in\
  \ the morning, you get to see the concrete jungle come to life\" he said. The weather\
  \ was amazing, almost daring us take off unnecessary extra clothing. Maputo is a\
  \ buzzing, lively city with Portuguese spoken everywhere. There is quite a lot of\
  \ construction happening around the city with new apartment blocks going up everywhere.\
  \ \n\nOur first stop was at the Botanical Gardens, the central market, which offers\
  \ a wide variety of fresh fruit, vegetable, herbs and the fish market.  We visited\
  \ a local restaurant, Ponte de Sol. We met up with Pedro, the owner, at his cozily\
  \ decorated unit, in the center is a round wooden table which up to 10 people can\
  \ share a meal of delicious dishes from across the continent. \"I learned to cook\
  \ as a young African man. I was the first of 6 children, my parents needed all the\
  \ help they can get\" Pedro tells me with a broad smile on his face, before launching\
  \ into an entertaining monologue about his life and times which mirror those of\
  \ the city he so clearly loves.\n\nSun-kissed and hugged by the warm breeze, we\
  \ slowly cruised on our bikes, down a side street lined with food stands and clothing\
  \ stalls. I heard loud music and we followed the sound. At the end of the lane was\
  \ an open-fronted, tin-shack bar with a massive sound system pumping out local dance\
  \ tunes. The vibe was amazing and we hung out with the people dancing in the dust\
  \ and joking in broken Portuguese, English and sign language. I spent two days lazing\
  \ around Maputo, enjoying all that goes with it, to the street vendors and fishermen\
  \ who catch the fresh fish supplied to the local restaurants. I found great friendliness\
  \ and generosity. It is humbling to see how much these people care for complete\
  \ strangers. This is the experience I longed for. \n\nI was surrounded by a wide\
  \ variety of people. I became a better listener, I became compelled to ask more\
  \ insightful questions. People had a genuine interest in what I had to say. I found\
  \ joy in other people's description of the world other than my own. \n\nWhat amazed\
  \ me was how different my life and their lives are but our life stories are very\
  \ similar and we're all in pursuit of happiness and love. When you are immersed\
  \ in constant novelty, conversing with people of different culture, background,\
  \ trying new food, saying yes to new activities, you inevitably experience a mental\
  \ shift."
