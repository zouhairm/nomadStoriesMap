Text: "Some journeys will be a part of our life where we yearn to visit again and\
  \ again. Maybe, to find something which we can never had or to feel the same fresh\
  \ air on the face which is rare to find. Coorg is the same kind which happened time\
  \ when I first visited . The sunrise on the first day made me realize that creation\
  \ is tend to amaze us again and again with the sun yet to rise ,the fog settled\
  \ on the mountains,the cooing of birds starting their day along with the fresh air\
  \ carrying the fragrance from tea plantations. \nFor a minute I thought if I had\
  \ wings I would dive right off from the cliff and dip in the fog which is settled\
  \ down in between the mountains and rise like the phoenix upto the eternal sky.\
  \ This was the first thought that came to my mind. No wonder the place is famous\
  \ for the honeymoon of newly wed couples .\nEasily connected roads filled with tea\
  \ plantations on either sides, spices induced local delicacies like pork and it's\
  \ home made chocolates had made my day trip . The people are really enthralling\
  \ just like they have something to say always all we need to do is approach and\
  \ initiate . Amazing tales would be heard. \nI had to end my trip abnoxiously due\
  \ to the emergency call received from work. But yet here I am waiting to fly again\
  \ through the mountains mist and fog underlying there."
