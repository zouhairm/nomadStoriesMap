Text: "Refusing to settle for a life of mediocrity, I am tested my limits and booked\
  \ a one way ticket to the land down under; having only with me a backpack and time.\
  \ Time to explore a new place, new people and most importantly myself. A two week\
  \ hostel stay was lined up and then what comes next: the unknown. My need to seek\
  \ further growth has over powered my need for comfort and stability. I wanted to\
  \ further learn to embrace change and overcome my fear of letting go. \n\nI have\
  \ spoken so much about following passions and listening to your inner guide, yet\
  \ I have remained hidden behind these words, only to emerge slightly here and there.\
  \ As I learn more about myself, I have discovered that in order to release all fears,\
  \ I must put myself in a situation where I am truly self-reliant. Only then will\
  \ I be able to fully surrender. \n\n\"The more in tune you are with the Universe,\
  \ the easier life is. The practice of surrender is one of turning over your need\
  \ to control, turning over your obsessiveness, turning over your belief system that\
  \ you have to make everything happen.\"- Gabby Bernstein\n\nThe journey ahead was\
  \ bumpy; a few break downs and tears as my anxiety emerged around the pressures\
  \ of finding work and a place to stay. However, I also saw a woman becoming lighter\
  \ from releasing the burden of control and feeling free to let life guide her. I\
  \ saw a higher trust in self and a happiness that can only be felt when you truly\
  \ follow your dreams.\n\nThe Universe provides you exactly what you need in order\
  \ to achieve your desires. Therefore whatever comes next will only be for my higher\
  \ good. Learning to accept this concept and letting it all effortlessly flow in,\
  \ will my greatest challenge. \n\nMelbourne has been quite the place to explore\
  \ and starting my journey off here has been a wonderful transition. The laid back\
  \ pace and hipster vibes of the Fitzroy streets mirror the familiar world of East\
  \ Van. All the vintage shops and cafes, alongside the street art and gardens have\
  \ allowed me to ease into life abroad. I have been captivated by the city and everyone\
  \ was right- I don't want to leave it! \n\nBut that being said, I know I must move\
  \ on. The purpose of this trip is to push myself further away from comfort and I\
  \ have become comfortable. I want to continue to explore more of this vast continent\
  \ and see the coastal beauty it holds. I had planed on making this city my base,\
  \ but my eyes have been opened to opportunities and I am being guided to continue\
  \ to explore. I could very easily settle myself here, but I believe that would only\
  \ stifle the growth I seek. \n\nI have met many beautifully unique people here and\
  \ memories have been made. As I look back at each individual, I see their place\
  \ in my journey. I understand why our interactions occurred and will forever be\
  \ grateful for their presence in my life! I was taught to laugh a little more, be\
  \ open to new experiences and was encouraged to follow my heart, letting go of expectations.\
  \ I bonded with strangers and shared stories about love and adventure. I smiled\
  \ a lot and picked up a few travel tips too! Melbourne was a solid start to this\
  \ Australian voyage and I know whatever lies ahead was because I followed my gut\
  \ and started here. \n\nIf you hold onto the ideas of how you think things should\
  \ develop, you will miss out on the opportunities right in front you. Do not let\
  \ that career, relationship or amazing adventure be delayed. Being in Melbourne\
  \ has taught me that what is meant for you will always make it's way. You will come\
  \ across the right people and places at exactly the right time. All you need to\
  \ do is let go of how you think things should unfold. Release all expectations and\
  \ be open to receive what is coming forth."
