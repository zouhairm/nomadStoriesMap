Text: "For those who don\xB4t know me, I\xB4m the oldest son in my family. I have\
  \ a brother, a cat and i used to have a dog. My parents are divorced and i spend\
  \ my live between Medell\xEDn and Bogot\xE1, two cities in Colombia. I\xB4ve been\
  \ a player in many different. I love sailing, diving and swimming. I like to draw\
  \ for hours and i like to walk cities with my camera just to capture people\xB4\
  s faces in the daily life.\n\nFor this moment I already learned and forgot how to\
  \ divide but I still remember PI is 3.141592. I have read some books and I wrote\
  \ some letters I didn\u2019t send when it was right. I don\xB4t like when people\
  \ sing the happy birthday song and I really hate unpunctuality. I like to learn\
  \ new star names but I hate tomato. I forgot the last time I gave flowers to someone\
  \ who worth it. I\xB4ve said \u201Cgo away\u201D and also said \u201CI love you\u201D\
  \ very very loud. Daily I work in the same people told me was worthless when I was\
  \ a kid, I draw and draw and\u2026 draw. My personal rebellion as pirates did, just\
  \ because I like pirates and actually, reading some of their stories I\xB4ve decided\
  \ to do this, against all odds, I\xB4ll leave all behind and become for a year a\
  \ nomad.\n\nMy name is Juan and this is my story. This is the start of a new chapter\
  \ on it, a normal, a simple life with ups and downs as any other that wants to become\
  \ amazing and extraordinary while I walk the world.\n\nOfficially, this is my last\
  \ night here. The place I used to call home is now empty. I just have an inflatable\
  \ mattress, two bottles of water and my cat is still running and looking for the\
  \ couch. The broom is waiting for me to finish the job. Now I realize I was wasting\
  \ space with lot of things I actually don\u2019t need or use.\nIn the corner of\
  \ what used to be a living room, the piece of crumpled paper that started all this.\
  \ \n\nMany years ago during school, someone asked us as a homework to write a list\
  \ of things to do before 30\xB4s. I found it \u2013or I think it jumped- while packing\
  \ the old books in a box. \nHave black car, adopt a cat, go back to Bogot\xE1 for\
  \ at list two years straight, learn the name of three different constellations,\
  \ move from my mother\xB4s house, be part of at list one tv show\u2026 and too many\
  \ things that actually now sound a little stupid. The thing was, when I found this\
  \ paper I started to check what was already done. Thirty things, thirty checks.\
  \ The thing was, when I found was twenty-nine. It wasn\xB4t a happy moment. There\
  \ were no future plans. And the worst, I had done it all without even remembering\
  \ that strange list.\n\nMy cat stares at me while I just cleaned and put the trash\
  \ in the last bag. In it goes the last trace of doubt. Until two weeks ago I would\
  \ return defeated to Medellin. A week ago I doubted if I would be able to leave\
  \ it behind and live the life I dream of, that of a nomadic pirate lover who makes\
  \ murals and takes pictures and writes about travel. Until yesterday the biggest\
  \ doubt was whether this adventure would start, in the north or in the south. Won\
  \ the south and the other day, very early we will be taking a flight to Peru. I\
  \ guess is time to jump because in this empty house I realized the world I built\
  \ wasn\u2019t enough for my jumping cat and for love we can leave it all behind."
