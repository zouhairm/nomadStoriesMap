Text: "The world is a huge place that we need to experience. It is similar to a book\
  \ that you like, because the more you read  the more you want to know how the story\
  \ flows and how it ends. When you travel, you want to see and explore the place\
  \ where you are. Every single place you visit is like a new story that you are reading\
  \ and learning about for the first time. Every single person you meet in those places\
  \ are like the characters of those stories. They are the guides on this journey\
  \ and you can see how that place is in real life. You can see how beautiful, simple,\
  \ peculiar and powerful that place can be.  You can see  how that story and that\
  \ place can touch you and make you feel like leaping into a completely different\
  \ world. It\u2019s a different culture and an unknown territory.\nYou can plan your\
  \ travel, but you don\u2019t know what will happen once you arrive. That is the\
  \ magic when you are on a trip. Being at the place you want to visit can be completely\
  \ different from what you were imagining.  The feelings and sensations go beyond\
  \ your expectations. You know the name of the place you are going and what  language\
  \ people speak but it\u2019s a new experience, a different culture, with a different\
  \ cuisine and that is the beauty and great pleasure of the unknown.  You just need\
  \ to open up your mind and soak it in.\nYou will treasure the unexpected surprises\
  \ you will always experience when you travel. You will discover a lot of new things\
  \ you didn\u2019t know about that city, about that culture or something the guides\
  \ didn\u2019t mention. Maybe it\u2019s as simple as a great view in the mountains\
  \ or a gorgeous sunset that you didn\u2019t notice before. It is extremely amazing\
  \ to see the world and its vast and diverse beauty. You can feel you are actually\
  \ part of this world.\nYou just need to dive into this multicultural experience\
  \ to see it.  You can make new friendships and grow as a person with this new experience.\
  \  You can see everything from a new perspective, and you will definitely learn\
  \ more about yourself. All you have to do is try it and open up your mind to new\
  \ possibilities and to know what\u2019s going on around you. You just need to feel\
  \ it because you are free and travelling makes you free.\nThe world is a great place\
  \ with great people. You just need go out and meet them and write a new story in\
  \ your life, make the perfect memories and enjoy every single moment. Allow yourself\
  \ to experience new things and amazing places even if you are not used to it."
