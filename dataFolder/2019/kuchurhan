Text: "It was an unwillingness to accept my immigrant parents\u2019 stereotyping of\
  \ their former neighbour countries that brought me here in the first place. Both\
  \ born and raised in Poland, both having fled the communist rule, they didn\u2019\
  t speak fondly of the places they had grown up beside, even 30 years later.\n\n\
  I stood in the middle of the dirt-ridden road, staring at the potholes in the distance.\
  \ A car hadn\u2019t passed in over 15 minutes. I wasn\u2019t sure what I was waiting\
  \ for. Even if a car did pass, I had no idea what I would do.\n\nOn my left were\
  \ the rusting fences decorated with barbed wire that I had just crossed a few minutes\
  \ ago. Behind them, a country that didn\u2019t exist. On my right were three houses\
  \ adorned with rotting wood panels. 70 kilometres beyond those near-abandoned homes\
  \ was my destination. \n\nEven after eight months of unpredictable travel, I never\
  \ expected to find myself stranded on the border of Transnistria and a village in\
  \ Ukraine whose name I couldn\u2019t even read. It only took a quick glance back\
  \ at the one-road town to confirm that I wouldn\u2019t find a hotel.\n\nThe morning\
  \ started with a gruelling, non-airconditioned bus ride in 34-degree heat. I left\
  \ Moldova for a short stopover in Transnistria. The independent state fascinated\
  \ me; so divided from its surroundings that it had its own border control and currency,\
  \ nonetheless completely unrecognized by any other country. Completely unknown by\
  \ any person I\u2019d ever met, for that matter. \n\nThe plan was set. After a few\
  \ hours of exploring the capital city, Tiraspol, I\u2019d board the last bus to\
  \ the Ukranian beach town of Odessa, perfectly in compliance with my Transnistrian\
  \ \u201Cvisa\u201D. \n\nThe unassuming city was seemingly stuck in the communist\
  \ era. Soviet-style banners bordered the streets, the architecture was brutalist\
  \ and a statue of Lenin welcomed visitors to the Presidential Planet. Bizarre as\
  \ the walk was, the visit went smoothly and the return to the station left me with\
  \ time to spare. \n\nI dropped my bags at the bus stop, only to be yelled at from\
  \ afar after a few short minutes. A lack of Russian knowledge made it easy to ignore\
  \ the unwanted attention, but it became more difficult when the older taxi driver\
  \ approached me. \u201COdessa?\u201D he asked. I nodded eagerly; the bus was late\
  \ after all. \u201CNo bus,\u201D he said. No Russian necessary to understand that\
  \ phrase. \n\nI ran into the station, but my attempts to find an English speaker\
  \ failed. The driver returned with a translated message that told me the bus broke.\
  \ A taxi could drive me to the border and he assured me that there was a bus in\
  \ the city on the other side to take me the rest of the way.\n\nYet here I was,\
  \ alone in the supposed city on the other side, better described as a field with\
  \ a few buildings. As I examined the deteriorating homes, a young woman walked out.\
  \ A conversation in mime and broken English established that her husband would take\
  \ me to the bus stop in Kuchurhan, where we would quickly discover that the only\
  \ bus to Odessa ran 12 hours earlier in the day. I took inventory of my warmest\
  \ clothes as I mentally prepared to bundle up in the middle of the field nearby.\
  \ \n\nThe husband stepped out of the car, soon returning with a group of people\
  \ that worked together to try to find any English words to speak with me. One brought\
  \ me a coffee and a candy bar, while others walked between cars at the border to\
  \ find out where they were going. Before I was able to register that I might be\
  \ spending the night being swarmed by mosquitoes, a couple came up to me. \n\nAs\
  \ I transferred my bag into their car, relief washed over me. Without a single comprehensible\
  \ word, I\u2019d found a way to get where I had planned. Every preconceived notion\
  \ I had inherited from my family had been shattered, and the yearning to experience\
  \ other cultures for myself was set in stone."
