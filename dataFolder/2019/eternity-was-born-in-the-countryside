Text: 'It is difficult and hard to stand still while moving and moving while standing
  still. Day by day is passing by, and all I see growing is my ficus plant that is
  getting higher and higher towards the ceiling. Well, it used to do so until I moved
  into a new apartment in a big city, where sunlight knocks from time to time on my
  door and life is getting heavier and heavier to bear. There is so much noise around.
  I''ve been trying to picture a quiet place and thoughts bring me to the countryside.

  The countryside.

  The place that gives you the feeling that time stopped, that everything is as it
  used to be and everlasting. And there, in that silence and stillness of the light,
  you merge into the picturesque view of land covered with green, green grass, trees
  slowly moved by the dance of the wind, the sunset drowned in colours and fuzzy shapes,
  vine trunks, sheep and birds: the quiet, the peace, the stillness of thought.

  It is the feeling you get when you sit on the edge of the mountain while looking
  into the distant immensity of everything there is. Or dive into the deep ocean surrounded
  by underwater livings, that watch you calmly while you are calmly watching them.

  To travel to the countryside is to travel into eternity. I did not expect to find
  that, but I just did for a moment, while caught in the big city life, where people
  oscillate like pendulums and lose themselves in the detriment of the daily rhythms.'
