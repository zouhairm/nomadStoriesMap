Text: "Never have I ever been locked up in a palace before. I guess what they say\
  \ is true: always a first time for everything.\n\nSix hours earlier I was walking\
  \ through the maze-like streets of Granada, taking delight in the multicolored facets\
  \ of the city. Alberto and I reached the front bars of the entrance and waited there\
  \ patiently, meanwhile some tourists were arguing whether God should be depicted\
  \ or not. The absence of figures in islamic art, replaced by highly complex and\
  \ abstract patterns has compelled me since I was a kid. \n\n\"Thinking about all\
  \ the military events that have taken place in this heavenly place makes me think\
  \ that us people, we have such an  erroneous idea of God.\" Alberto said that to\
  \ me as we were walking in Paseo de los Cipreses. And he was right. All of my five\
  \ senses were entranced by the vibrant green colour of the trees, the mild melody\
  \ of the water running as a perfect accompaniment of the birds song, giving me almost\
  \ a synesthetic experience.\n\nSuch a perfect balance between nature and architecture,\
  \ as if both were sharing this particular moment of the eternal peace. We sat down\
  \ at the rocks contemplating the sundown at the 27-meter high Torre de la Vela,\
  \ the watchtower. When Abu Abdullah, doomed to be the last Moorish king of the Nasrid\
  \ dynasty surrendered, the Christians installed a bell there in order to call residents\
  \ on occasional tragic events. The sun setting reminded me of the decline of an\
  \ empire. I was wrapped in thoughts about the Alhambra, such an architectural masterpiece\
  \ bridging two different civilizations into one hybrid culture. \n\n\"Why is it\
  \ so hard for different cultures to merge into one without any trouble? Can you\
  \ imagine such coalescence? That I would call heaven!\" Alberto said to me with\
  \ a hard set smile on his face. As if he was reading my mind. Unable to say anything,\
  \ I wanted to stay in the moment, so I raised my camera to take a picture of him.\
  \ Just before pressing the button, the battery died. We both laughed at the impossibility\
  \ to retain time. To try to capture the moment meant to imprison spontaneity.\n\n\
  We packed our stuff and headed to the exit gates. We were locked up in the gardens\
  \ of Heaven and all that was left to do was just to wait. Suddenly there was light\
  \ on the other side: Policia Nacional has arrived. We explained our situation and\
  \ apologized for being so late. \n\n\"Try to cross over that fence. In case you\
  \ fail to do so, call the police! Have a good evening!\" \n\nThe policemen simply\
  \ told us to call the policemen and suddenly left. What a tricky situation! We started\
  \ climbing the fence and it almost felt like we were besieged trying to escape the\
  \ Alhambra. That experience somehow gave authenticity to my day. I wondered  how\
  \ many people had to jump over the fence just because they got to admire the Alhambra\
  \ for so long. That would remain unknown."
