Text: "\u201CGo away.\u201D The driver who was also our tour guide tried to cast them\
  \ out. Dozens of children blocked us and tried to grab our hand. I initially pushed\
  \ them away, but their perseverance made me surrendered. I had expected they might\
  \ steal my belongings. They outnumbered us. \u201CHold me! Hold me!\u201D Each of\
  \ them attempted to vanquish each other\u2019s shouts. The one who got our hand\
  \ will get the \u2018tourist fee\u2019. \n\nMy fianc\xE9e and I were the only visitor\
  \ of that virgin beach in Sumba. A yellow sandy beach with hollowed cliff, mentioned\
  \ by travel influencer as the \u2018it\u2019 place yet they forgot to tell the dangerous\
  \ rock climbing without safety fence. The kind of sedative beach that was so deserted,\
  \ making us an easy prey for these delinquents. Two hours flight distance from Bali\
  \ felt like 2 decades of differences.\n\nThe rock was outrageously slippery and\
  \ the beach was still far. I was acrophobic and almost fainted. I let one of the\
  \ bigger boy held me. He helped me to carry my belongings. He walked carefully and\
  \ synchronized his pace. We arrived an hour later. I no longer cared that I wore\
  \ a white dress and I just sit there because I felt so ill. I closed my eyes, listened\
  \ to the calming waves. \n\nAll of a sudden, the silent was broken. \u201CAirplane!\u201D\
  \ Those children howled in high tone, cheered happily and ran together following\
  \ a drone. The moment my fianc\xE9e drove his drone was the moment that came alive.\
  \ They all laughed together and played around at the shores. They jumped to catch\
  \ the drone and even climbed the coconut trees. Their mesmerizing smiles arose with\
  \ their delightful look \u2013 a rare combination which I had not seen for a long\
  \ time.\n \nI drank the last drop of mineral water and crushed the plastic bottle.\
  \ I put it beside me and reminded myself to bring it to our car, but a strong wind\
  \ blew it away. Those children ran for the plastic bottle and treat it as their\
  \ treasurable toy. While metropolitan children played smartphone, here are they,\
  \ fought over a plastic bottle trash. I was so ashamed of myself. Was a trash the\
  \ best present I could give?  \n\n\u201CHere, come over!\u201D I invited them to\
  \ gather around me and take out snacks from my string bags. Two package of chips\
  \ and a pack of coated nuts. They smiled and thanked me over and over. They asked\
  \ me where I came from with stammering Indonesian language. Behind the ragged clothes\
  \ and dirty face, there was a big curiosity. They shared their dreams; some wanted\
  \ to be a doctor, a teacher, even just wanted to visit Jakarta, the capital city.\
  \ \n\nI saw them no longer as rascals, but as underprivileged little angels. It\
  \ was far from my imagination to find pure laughter and immense dreams in this isolated\
  \ island."
