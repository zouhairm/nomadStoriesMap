Text: once in past that was before 1 year we had fest in our university and all mechanical
  students joined at fest we're excited what gonna happen in fest and many excited
  things while fest and then we can't stay at one place so thought to go out for nature
  and while going one of my friend name Akram who was met with accident by bike and
  they were riding rash after drinking alcohol. we argued with them and took my friend
  to hospital and doctor said his muscle was injured and again we went to fest and
  ate dinner and we danced for DJ and the we took pics with friends then fest was
  completed and we waited for friends to leave them at home and we stopped at a shop
  to smoke but cops arrived then my friends thrown cigar by seeing them and then our
  riding began we're so hungry and went to eat  something at food court and we were
  going to friend's home and one of us said with tone of fear and little voice "can
  we go for short trip" and I was excited and said yeah and my other 5 friends are
  thinking about  the trip but none of our parents allow us for trip and one friend
  name Akhil has been dropped and went to home and other took mobile then called to
  their parents and talked that the fest will get late so we're gong to friend's home
  and now bike ride for trip begins and we didn't expect that we are at small trip
  and excitement in everyone face and feelings were surprising,shocked,joyous,happy,smile,curiosity,care
  and love..Obviously the friendship has love too and the place we're traveling at
  a place which fills with dense jungle and waterfalls.The drive through the dense
  jungle is an exhilarating experience.Then after 6hrs we have reached the destination
  and mostly no rooms were available and at one place the room was booked but we asked
  and took 3 rooms and the hotel worker said that the rules are changed your not allowed
  to smoke r drink r any bad things.we took room and left to eat breakfast at some
  other place.The breakfast was delicious and we came to room and slept until afternoon
  and went to eat lunch and the food was yummy.we told her that we eat bamboo,bamboo
  biryani and chicken fry at night so she can prepare them at night and traveled to
  nearer forest to explode and we located a waterfall and we enjoyed in waterfall
  and climbing hill.the water hill was slope and we are climbing and sliding down
  and the feelings are extraordinary that all feelings are mixed and can see at one
  place and we are tired to walk after playing and we reached room.Two of us went
  to bring the food which was told at afternoon to make it and she was given food
  and we paid money and returned to room with food,cigar and alcohol.Unexpected results
  came after drinking the hotel worker was silent by seeing us and slept quietly and
  we traveled to home while reaching we faced the problems the chain of bike was broken
  suddenly we checked for mechanic at near village and again it was in good condition
  and we're in our way again the bike tire was punctured so we looked for mechanic
  and we found repaired and it became late and our parents were calling and saying  "why
  u haven't reached home" and we said it will be late due to problems and maybe we
  come tomorrow .After reaching home safely.The story mainly depends upon how we managed
  family members while next day the unexpected trip with unexpected situations and
  problems and how parents treated after reaching home I'd leave that to your imagination
  but it was one of unexpected trip but we have many experiences while traveling and
  meeting new people and communications and filled with emotional feelings and learned
  that we can know about a person character.New adventures r trips for life to enjoy
  with unlimited happiness,love,care,smile without racism.Traveling makes the life
  much better then running back for money and traveling make  people to learn many
  things which can't learn by education.......(;
