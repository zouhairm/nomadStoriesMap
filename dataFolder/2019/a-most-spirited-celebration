Text: "Claudinho rolled around on the floor sucking his thumb. Laira tied the laces\
  \ of opposite shoes together and shrieked with glee as ankles tangled and tripped.\
  \ Valmir hurled his plastic plate across the room like a frisbee, snapped his fork\
  \ in two, then dug into the cake with his bare hands.\n     \u201CIt\u2019s mine!\u201D\
  \ he called out, face a mess of blue frosting. \u201CAll mine!\u201D\n     \u201C\
  No!\u201D called another, clawing away. \u201CIt\u2019s mine!\u201D\n      Other\
  \ voices and hands joined in. \u201CMine!\u201D the chorus swelled. \u201CMine!\
  \ Mine!\u201D \n      A bunch of misbehaving toddlers. That\u2019s what I\u2019\
  d expected when Jorge invited me to his Candombl\xE9 temple\u2019s Day of the Children\
  \ celebration in Salvador da Bahia, Brazil. But not this. Anything but this.\n \
  \     Claudinho was six feet tall and weighed well over two hundred pounds. Laira\
  \ was a successful lawyer. Valmir was a retired prescription glasses salesman (with\
  \ his bald head, he made the most convincing baby). Only ninety minutes ago, they\
  \ had all been conversing in civilized adult tones about the weather, their families,\
  \ and politics. That was before the drums started.\n      You may think Brazil is\
  \ a Catholic country. Well, it is and it isn\u2019t. There are about 50,000 Catholic\
  \ churches across this massive country, but there are estimated to be nearly 500,000\
  \ Afro-Brazilian centers of worship. From the same melting pot which produced bossanova\
  \ and samba emerged a wide range of syncretized (that is to say, mixed) religions,\
  \ each a distinct combination of African, European, and indigenous American beliefs.\
  \ Among these religions, Candombl\xE9 is the most popular, and Salvador da Bahia\
  \ -- once the first slave port in the New World -- is its capital.\n       Among\
  \ the practices to survive the grisly slave ship voyage across the Atlantic was\
  \ the ritual of trance. On the floor where the massive children crawled were scattered\
  \ dried leaves and flowers, indicative of the fact that the spirits of Candombl\xE9\
  , unlike the Christian God, come from the natural world. As such, they can be accessed\
  \ and invited into a body if one knows the correct procedure. Normally the spirits\
  \ were one of the sixteen orixas, deities representing different forces of nature,\
  \ like Xango the axe-wielder, whose blood is lightning. But on the Day of the Children,\
  \ the visiting spirits were those of anyone who had died too young.\n      At first\
  \ they only danced, stomping around and around in a slow circle. But as the drumming\
  \ became louder and more frenetic, eyes rolled back in heads, arms flung out to\
  \ the sides and spasmed uncontrollably, and my skin erupted in goosebumps. One woman\
  \ fell to the ground, seemingly unconscious, and had to be covered by a veil and\
  \ carried off. Then, at the peak of the drumming\u2019s intensity, the music cut\
  \ out like the sudden lifting of a record player\u2019s needle, and there was a\
  \ moment of perfect silence. A second later, the possessed dancers cried out in\
  \ delight and tumbled to the floor. That\u2019s when the thumb sucking started.\n\
  \     I studied anthropology at college. Cultural sensitivity is my game. I am the\
  \ first to interrupt a conversation and defend the Aztec practice of tearing out\
  \ human hearts. And yet there was something about the experience that I found jarring.\n\
  \     \u201CHow do you know--\u201C I paused, not wanting to be offensive, but the\
  \ question was burning a hole through my tongue. \u201CHow do you know they aren\u2019\
  t faking it?\u201D\n     Jorge laughed. \u201COf course you ask that question,\u201D\
  \ he said. \u201CThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll never enter a trance.\u201D \n    \
  \ In my time in Brazil, I\u2019ve learned that the mind is not the only way to relate\
  \ to life. The mind does not cause the lightspeed hip gyrations of samba, or the\
  \ harmonic flow of movements in the half-dance half-martial art of capoeira. But\
  \ I\u2019m a bad samba dancer and an even worse capoeirista, and the idea of trance\
  \ still boggles my -- well, there\u2019s that word again.\n     It\u2019s okay.\
  \ I don\u2019t have to understand everything to appreciate it. In fact, when I fail\
  \ to understand, a most awesome feeling is refreshed in me: that this world is made\
  \ up of worlds, and life is infinitely larger than even the stars can suggest. \n\
  \     But I gotta run now -- the cake is flying!"
