Text: "It seemed like an escape , a calm in the chaos, a place to be! For all I wanted\
  \ was to walk a thousand miles and explore every aspect of my path!  \nI was running\
  \ from life. I was running from the very thought of facing it and yet it all seemed\
  \ right to do. On the other hand all I was praying was to stop on the right path\
  \ at the right time. \nFirst step in the journey,  first step to the path yet unfolded\
  \ and there I was standing like a fireball ready to explode and fall into different\
  \ places to find the right direction and walk ahead. \nPilani : \nThe city with\
  \ an open heart.\nYou never come to know when you get the right view to your direction\
  \ but you head out to try your luck,  to experience the obstacles,  to come close\
  \ to yourself and understand life. \nWith the weather heating up I was cold inside\
  \ as the numbness struck hard. People were heading out on the daily basis. I used\
  \ to stare at them and analyse their side of the unfolded path. It was a safe way\
  \ to stay sane as I led myself to meet new faces with different experiences and\
  \ learn. \nNever imaging myself to walk alone I was at that moment all alone but\
  \ sometimes luck is all you need and I did get lucky on finding people who held\
  \ my hand and made my feel the warmest at that moment! \nThere was nothing else\
  \ that felt right that time but the feeling of having someone around was a bliss!\
  \ \nLesson learnt - it's the vibe that finds your tribe! \nHomesickness came rushing\
  \ and tears rolled down for I knew this is not enough for me , for my journey! \n\
  It was the people who let me be and that day I realised I am home! \nLesson learnt\
  \ : Universe works it out as written!\nYears have passed , path has changed, identity\
  \ has progressed but haven't left home for it was the happiest I could ever be.\
  \ \nThe journey to Pilani is the path that unfolded and led me to me!"
