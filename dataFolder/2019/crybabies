Text: "You don\u2019t sing \"happy birthday\" at your own birthday party. Just like\
  \ you don\u2019t sing \u201Cfor he\u2019s a jolly good fellow\u201D at your own\
  \ promotion or whatever. So why would The National sing \"Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks\"\
  \ at their own music festival? Instead, the audience took over, switching roles\
  \ and serenading the band instead. We all knew every word.\n\nBut let me start at\
  \ the beginning\u2026\n\nOf course I am talking about The National Homecoming Festival\
  \ in Cincinnati, OH. We bought our tickets months in advance, as soon as the festival\
  \ was announced, before we even knew the lineup. All the other bands were just a\
  \ happy bonus. The Breeders, Father John Misty, Julien Baker, Feist, Future Islands,\
  \ Big Thief, and more. The unspoken theme of the festival was heartbreakingly beautiful\
  \ music - or \"sad bastard music\" as Barry from High Fidelity might call it. This\
  \ wasn\u2019t the festival you go to to dance, it was the festival for introverts\
  \ who have all cried to this music in their darkest hours, myself included. Such\
  \ sad and meaningful music you feel like you know a little bit about everyone there.\
  \ It almost felt more like a support group than a typical festival audience.\n\n\
  Saturday was cold. The cold just adding to the angst of it all, as if we weren\u2019\
  t all angsty enough. Usually when I\u2019m chilly at a festival, I\u2019ll just\
  \ dance harder. Well, as I said, this wasn\u2019t really that type of festival.\
  \ I danced all I could to The Breeders (the only semi-dancable name on the bill),\
  \ then I just had to settle with my cold sad girl angst for the rest of the day.\
  \ You could tell all the artists were cold as well. Kim Deal kept adding layer after\
  \ layer, at one point putting on a winter hat. Father John Misty, who is usually\
  \ quite chatty at shows, just played the songs with no banter in between. My guess\
  \ is because he was cold too.\n\n\nJulien Baker was the highlight of Saturday for\
  \ me. First, I was so excited she was on the lineup to begin with. I have loved\
  \ her since her first album was released in 2015. Even better, not only was she\
  \ on the lineup, she played directly before The National, which in my mind means\
  \ she was basically headlining, right? I was so excited for her. We sat at the top\
  \ of a hill and watched her perform with the Ohio River and the setting sun as her\
  \ backdrop. It felt like exactly how you should always listen to her.\n\n\nThen\
  \ it came time to see The National. Matt Berninger\u2019s mom was in the crowd.\
  \ I was just imagining a flashback of a young Matt Berninger telling his mom he\
  \ wanted to be a musician when he grew up\u2026flash forward to him headlining a\
  \ music festival in his name in his hometown.\n\nThey brought out a ton of guests\
  \ artists, as we all expected they would. Ben Sloan, Lisa Hannigan, Julien Baker.\
  \ It was pure magic. Julien Baker and Matt Berninger\u2019s voices were made for\
  \ each other. They are musical soul mates, and it was musical destiny for them to\
  \ perform together. \n\nIt was emotional to sing Vanerlyle Crybaby Geeks. You could\
  \ tell the band was in awe of it all. The whole night. The whole weekend. What started\
  \ as a small garage band in Cincinnati was now headlining their own music festival\
  \ in the town where they got their start. The audience was not only excited to see\
  \ them, but equally emotional about it.\n\nThe night ended with simple words from\
  \ Matt Berninger, \u201CThis feels like home. Thank you so much.\u201D"
