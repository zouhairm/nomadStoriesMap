Text: "Hi,\nMy name is Stefanie and I'm the founder of Atelier Stefani - a brand that\
  \ stands for uniquely handcrafted shoes. \nA few months ago I travelled to Milan\
  \ to visit little family owned shoemaking factories and to get inspired by the fashion\
  \ metropolis. Italy is the birthplace of the shoemaking industry, leather tanneries\
  \ and it is the embodiment of elegance and style. Milan sets designers' standards\
  \ for perfection. There are so many different associations I have in mind when it\
  \ comes to Italy: luxury, quality, fashion, good wine, delicious food - La Dolce\
  \ Vita.\nWandering through the city, I discovered old traditional shoemakers' workshops\
  \ and little design stores that transmitted the feeling of a different time in history.\
  \ I think fashion, just like any other form of art, can take you to certain places\
  \ by stimulating your senses. Music, for example, is a huge inspiration for me and\
  \ looking at the big picture I can find many parallels to my craft.\nShoemaking\
  \ is the art to combine the beauty of the design with the comfort we need to live\
  \ our busy lifestyle. It is the exact balance of the melody and the lyrics. Shoes\
  \ set the rhythm of your steps, making your inner music flow through your body.\
  \ It's the creative tension between structure and spontaneity.\nSo as I walked through\
  \ the streets of Milan, those little studios and shops reminded me of something\
  \ so essential. There was a time, long before mass production became a thing, when\
  \ artisans and craftsmen were making something for the individual. They didn't follow\
  \ any trends; the client and their original were the centre of their attention -\
  \ for a reason. Our nature doesn't know any standards. I feel like our modern society\
  \ has taken that spark of originality away from us by standardising processes, fit,\
  \ design and eventually us. We drift away from something that used to be so important\
  \ and useful to who we are as individuals with an expressive nature unique to us\
  \ all.\nAfter realising this I came to the conclusion that I have to make a difference.\
  \ With an open mind I discover all those beautiful places and cultures that inspire\
  \ my creativity so much. \nI aim to make shoes of integrity for people of character,\
  \ shoes that tell a story and help give you a sense of joy, but also confidence\
  \ and authenticity. I strive for the 'rebirth of the cool', for exploring the world\
  \ and also evolving in my own character. I want to be true to myself and to you,\
  \ do what I love doing and bring that little something to the world, that makes\
  \ life a bit more enjoyable."
