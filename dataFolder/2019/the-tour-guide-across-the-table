Text: "During the second coldest winter since the Korean War, I arrived in Seoul on\
  \ what was Boxing Day back home in the UK. For the next two weeks, I would be studying\
  \ \u2018Beginner\u2019s Korean\u2019 in a classroom full of other foreign exchange\
  \ students at Hanyang International Winter School. Unlike the rest, I was travelling\
  \ solo to a remote destination - remote meaning I knew not a single soul who lived\
  \ there - and all this for the first time! I was excited to say the least. \nTo\
  \ avoid disappointment, I had kept expectations low. Two weeks would not be a long\
  \ time if I wanted to make substantial gains in my Korean lingual prowess. Anyway,\
  \ my schedule was already filled up with classes, a musical, a ski trip, opening\
  \ and closing ceremonies. But this travel story will not be recounting any of those\
  \ tales. Rather, it is about the resident student who introduced me to a Seoul beyond\
  \ my fantasised reconstruction of the spellbinding city. \nThe first time he spoke\
  \ to me, it was two days before my birthday: the resident students assigned to group\
  \ 7 had organised a trip to Lotte World, the world\u2019s largest indoor theme park.\
  \ My roommate and I signed up for the excursion, and that was when we were introduced.\
  \ Later on, I discovered he wasn\u2019t even a resident student for group 7 but\
  \ for group 1! Many of the exchange students did not actually come along, since\
  \ they already had arrangements with their classmates from home. In fact, as we\
  \ took line 2 on the subway, I counted an equal number of Korean students to exchange\
  \ students once we all stepped off at Jamsil Station.  Naturally, we all conversed\
  \ in English. Absorbed in debate with my roommate from Karachi, when I finally took\
  \ a pause to breathe, a tap on the shoulder turned me towards his face, grinning\
  \ in wide-eyed wonder. In a slight accent, he asked if I wanted to go shopping after\
  \ going on the rides. Apparently, the theme park was attached to mega-mall, Lotte\
  \ World Mall. Even though there would be a lot of walking and standing around in\
  \ sub-zero weather, and especially because it was a Friday evening after a full\
  \ day\u2019s onslaught of intense language learning, I thought I would have been\
  \ more tired. Yet sincere conversation was never lacking.  \nThe most memorable\
  \ ride also just happened to be the one where I ended up seated beside him. The\
  \ Gyro Drop is tame compared to its taller competitors. Nevertheless, the height\
  \ of the free-fall ride didn\u2019t nearly bother an acrophobic like myself, as\
  \ much as his comical cries did. \n\u201CI don\u2019t wanna die!!!\u201D Was a girl\
  \ meant to laugh? Or console him? I\u2019m just thankful I wore contact lenses that\
  \ day. Thankful not for the usual fear of dropping my glasses halfway through a\
  \ ride, but for the scene before me, of \u2018Magic Island\u2019. Seventy metres\
  \ above ground, one could almost forget you had the lakeside view over an artificial\
  \ island. A second before we fell - in what felt like the most drawn out second\
  \ ever - he stopped hollering. \nUnfortunately, he had to leave early for training\
  \ the next morning. Despite the night rolling pleasantly along without him, I found\
  \ myself mulling over his image as we watched the colourfully lit ice rink a ground\
  \ below us, filled with happy families and couples circling the perimeter. \nFour\
  \ days passed until we met again. This time it was over dinner. By this point, it\
  \ was clear to my roommate and probably some of the others at the table, that my\
  \ attention wasn\u2019t on the food, but on the man ordering it. Never at any point\
  \ was I able to practise my Korean, yet the engagement is one of my fondest memories\
  \ of the country. Perhaps it was the raw beef that was my undoing, since I poured\
  \ all my raw thoughts and feelings into our talk. \nAt our third and final meeting,\
  \ he again had to depart early. He left the party during our board game bonanza.\
  \ Having sat in front of him for a majority of the time I spent outside the classroom,\
  \ we bid me a safe trip back home."
