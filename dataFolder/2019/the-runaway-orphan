Text: "Becoming an orphan at 17 wasn't the plan. Maybe life gives you hiccups and\
  \ not just lemons. For the next 3 years I took up the responsibility of my family\
  \ and on the way, my body took up alot of weight too. \n\nOne fine day when I was\
  \ done whining about my boring life to my diary, a popup of \"cheapest places to\
  \ travel\" drew my attention. Next thing I know, I'm in the land of happiness to\
  \ find mine. I never expected to find myself in a situation where I'll be traveling\
  \ alone to another country leaving behind my family to manage on their own. I guess\
  \ there are too many layers to one's personality one hasn't discovered yet.\n\n\
  I hitchhiked from one city to another and the people were too warm towards me. They\
  \ loved the country I came from. They loved the people I stayed with. I was offered\
  \ free stay most of those nights but never even once I felt this hunch of danger\
  \ of being a solo woman in an unknown country. \n\nThe highlight of this travel\
  \ was the Tigers nest. Yes, I had decided to end my trip on a high note literally.\
  \ I did hear about the trek being difficult but never thought it would be difficult\
  \ enough to make my vagina bleed. Yup I got my periods in the first 10 steps. And\
  \ asthma was dancing around me saying , oh! You thought I'll leave you alone ? I\
  \ took a 2 minute break every 10 steps. Mind you I was 22. An elderly man was helping\
  \ me with the motivation I needed to keep going. I needed alot. After 3 hrs I finally\
  \ made it. And it was time to see the temple everyone made so much efforts to reach\
  \ especially me. I enter the main hall and people are chanting prayers and revolving\
  \ around the idol. I join them too. Next thing I know I have been doing it for 30\
  \ mins straight. The trance of the scenario was too intense. I'm crying my heart\
  \ out. No noise. Just tears running down while I keep walking in circles. \n\nFinally\
  \ a monk holds my hand and takes me 2 km up to his other monastery. He says nothing.\
  \ Offers me food and we watch the sun going down together. Next day we wake up at\
  \ 4am, pray, cook, meditate, eat, work, cook, eat, meditate, work, sunset, sleep.\
  \ This continued for the next 3 days. The final day I finally broke down and cried\
  \ my heart out. That was the first time he said something to me. \n\n\" You deserve\
  \ happiness and you finally have emptied your heart for it.\" I didn't understand\
  \ completely what he meant by that but the coming months made me realise what he\
  \ saw that I didn't. I wasn't open towards possibilities.  I never took an opportunity.\
  \ I always complained and felt that I HAD to look after my little brother who wasn't\
  \ little anymore. But he was fine without me for those 10 days. Those external factors\
  \ weren't the ones tying me down, it were my own thoughts. \n\nNext thing I know,\
  \ I'm following my heart.\nMy \"have to\" list is now replaced by my \" want to\"\
  \ list. I found love when I stopped seeking it. I found happiness when I lost hope\
  \ of finding anything close to it.\n\nSurely I wasn't expecting a sun going down\
  \ will make my life rise from those ashes I created myself."
