Text: "A few years ago, I was traveling around Australia on a working holiday visa\
  \ after finishing high school in Germany. My good friend Katy and I had bought a\
  \ little white Hyundai Excel to travel down the east coast. However, we didn\u2019\
  t just use the car as a mode of transportation, we basically lived in it for a couple\
  \ of months. While I could tell plenty of stories about these times, there is one\
  \ standing out as it influenced our whole trip. \nWe were on our way down south\
  \ to Sydney and decided to make a short stop at Port Stephens, an area located in\
  \ the Hunter Region of New South Wales. While we actually wanted to have a look\
  \ at some of the beaches there, go for a swim and then continue driving to the next\
  \ bigger town, Newcastle, the day didn\u2019t quite go as planned. Our mobile reception\
  \ wasn\u2019t the best and without a navigation system in the car and only a few\
  \ old road maps we took some wrong turns and it took us the better part of the day\
  \ to actually find Port Stephens. We ended up not seeing much of the area after\
  \ all which left us feeling a tad frustrated, therefore we just wanted to go to\
  \ the nearest camping area, cook some dinner and call it an early night. On our\
  \ way to the camping area we noticed our almost empty gas tank, a fact that we had\
  \ somehow overlooked earlier. Knowing that there weren\u2019t many gas stations\
  \ around we took a turn and went back hoping we\u2019d make it to one we saw earlier.\
  \ Luckily, before actually running out of gas - an experience I had made in the\
  \ middle of nowhere in Italy on a family trip years before, and that I wasn\u2019\
  t keen on making again - we saw the lights of the gas station. Just after we arrived\
  \ there, a white truck pulled up next to us and a guy jumped out. He looked like\
  \ a typical aussie surfer to me: barefooted, no shirt on, tanned and with blonde\
  \ threadlocks. The surfer dude made his way to the shop past our car and asked if\
  \ we were backpacking after spotting our sleeping bags and pillows in the backseat.\
  \ After chatting with him for a while it turned out that he was also a backpacker\
  \ from Germany. But as he liked surfing at least half of my assumption about him\
  \ was right. Having told us that he and some other backpackers were camping on his\
  \ boss\u2019s farm only a short drive from the station, he invited us to stay there\
  \ for the night. As it already turned dark and we had been driving around all day,\
  \ we thankfully accepted the offer and decided to continue our road trip the next\
  \ morning. Well, what can I say, we didn\u2019t leave the next morning nor the morning\
  \ after\u2026 we ended up staying there for about two months. Time passed by quickly,\
  \ during the days we\u2019d explore the area, go swimming or babysit the neighbor\u2019\
  s daughter. In the evenings we\u2019d sit around a fire with the other backpackers\
  \ and our neighbors, while listening to music, drinking some beers, sharing our\
  \ travel stories and looking for shooting stars. We didn\u2019t live in much luxury,\
  \ our kitchen for example was an old school table equipped with a gas cooker, a\
  \ sandwich maker and an electric kettle, our bathroom was shared between up to 20\
  \ people and all around the area old carnival rides, such as bumper cars, were stored.\
  \ But that never really bothered me and while I\u2019d always considered myself\
  \ to be a humble person, living there made me realize once again that you really\
  \ don\u2019t need much to be happy. Leaving the farm after two wonderful months\
  \ felt weird even if we continued our trip together with some of our new friends\
  \ to work in a suburb of Sydney. After all we had to say goodbye to a second home,\
  \ we never expected to find."
