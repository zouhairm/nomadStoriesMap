Text: "\u201CHello, this is the office of Mr. Margarito, how can I help you?\u201D\
  \ - the last thing I expected to hear when reaching out to a shaman. It was a friend\u2019\
  s suggestion for authentic activity in Mexico. Little did I know about the well\
  \ ordered world of spiritual service, and now I am caught off-guard with phone in\
  \ my hand.\nThe girl on the line is a secretary with aplomb on a par with personal\
  \ assistants in the white-collar world. You shall not pass until you get an appointment.\
  \ Procedure is meticulous if not bizarre. Nobody asked for my last name, yet I have\
  \ to specify my blood type and shoe size. I am not allowed to sign up for my friends\
  \ (probably, for good - I\u2019d be terrorised for not getting their metrics straight),\
  \ and after a round of giggly QA phone session, we set to making travel arrangements.\
  \ \nThe road -- monotonous in shape and scenery -- takes us north from M\xE9rida,\
  \ till the very edge of Yucat\xE1n Peninsula. The coastline is not finite per se:\
  \ as if by unfinished clumsy cut a stretch of land is separated both from the rest\
  \ of the country and from the sea. There are few towns on the way with densely built-up\
  \ streets full of trays with coconuts-to-go, original Volkswagen Beetles, and cantinas.\
  \ Yet the bigger part of territory is inhabited randomly and developed eclectically\
  \ with houses ranging from shabby constructions made from clay and straw to luxurious\
  \ all-inclusive resorts.   \nThe shaman\u2019s residence couldn\u2019t have been\
  \ located better. Next to the flamingo lagoon with enthralling pink waters, it is\
  \ hidden in a dense thicket that fences a sandbank. Neither land, nor water - the\
  \ place oozes an other-worldly appeal. The building is somewhat a decaying version\
  \ of traditional Mexican home: a one-story adobe house with overhanging tile roof\
  \ and small windows with wood shutters. The door is ominously red, and I have to\
  \ force myself to enter.\nThe interior defies every expectation by its uncanny resemblance\
  \ with a three-star hotel. A woman at reception desk greets us cheerfully and warns\
  \ that payments can only be made in cash. The house appears to have a paved outdoor\
  \ area where each of us is summoned individually for \u201Cdiagnosis\u201D. In a\
  \ 20-minute  t\xEAte-\xE0-t\xEAte, the old gentlemen dressed and groomed rather\
  \ casually except for the abundance of jewellery, inquires about mental and physical\
  \ health, family history, and priorities in life. Session\u2019s bonus: if you are\
  \ unable to identify a problem in your life, mister shaman could do it for you.\
  \ After all, whether it is a sick relative, financial troubles, or low libido, -\
  \ everything is linked to matters transcending the physical. \nTo manage our spiritual\
  \ difficulties we are first asked to purchase certain goods: coconuts, tequila,\
  \ spices -- all to be found on a near-by market. The place is an epitome of cultural\
  \ blend between Spanish and Maya traditions: icons, chicken legs, candles, flowers,\
  \ magic mushrooms, and objects the name of which only local language can convey,\
  \ - beliefs and artefacts mingle on the shelves attesting to vibrant identity of\
  \ the Yucat\xE1n state. \nThe \u201Ccleansing\u201D ritual ensues. Stimulants infused\
  \ in the process ensure that the experience would be unforgettable albeit ungraspable.\
  \ Started as a collective chanting, the ceremony escalates into a full-scale action.\
  \ Coconuts mean to deposit individual\u2019s energy upon shaking-smoking-crying\
  \ procedure. A spectacular fire-making scene follows. The shaman picks up a handful\
  \ of spices, asks to spit into it and to spare a drop of blood, and in a rather\
  \ dramatic gesture scatters it all over the fire turning flames green. The ritual\
  \ culminates in throwing coconuts into the circle. Mine cracks immediately emanating\
  \ bluish sparkles. A very good sign. Not all shots are as successful, and a mild\
  \ curse is detected. \"Immediately treatable for a small surcharge\", - murmurs\
  \ the shaman. The urgency of treatment seems unquestionable at the moment, and we\
  \ stay for extra measures. \nWhat a blast, I think to myself on the way back. And\
  \ only one thing haunts me after this perfect thrill: why did they need to know\
  \ my shoe size?"
