Text: "An overnight train journey from Guwahati (the only nearby Airport town) is\
  \ the only way to get into Arunachal Pradesh. The setting aboard the nicknamed \u201C\
  Green Express\u201D was communal. Spirits soared as visitors, musicians, lovers,\
  \ friends and locals all laughed together, expressed freely and shared their gifts,\
  \ food, water and supplies. The happy banter, beat boxes, guitars, harmonicas, flutes\
  \ and singing drowned out the sweet chugging sounds of the engine. The space though\
  \ limited with a designated seating for 6 people in every 6 feet X 6 feet block,\
  \ saw an occupancy of twice the designated number. Three bunks on both sides (6\
  \ feet X 2 feet) with is the Indian Railways way of utilizing space most effectively,\
  \ but even in the limited-ness no one seemed to mind a few extra pairs of hands\
  \ and legs! \n\nOnboard, I met Makima Chawngthu a musician from Sikkim. In his village,\
  \ nobody locks their house and if your house is burgled, it\u2019s mostly the neighbour\
  \ who\u2019ll come in, take rice and grains and leave, while being sure to leave\
  \ tell-tale signs. Surprisingly, it\u2019s considered a disgrace to get robbed,\
  \ for it implies that you had more than required whilst your neighbour was wanting.\
  \ \n\nAfter securing permits the next morning, a six-hour ride through clouds on\
  \ hilly potholed roads in shared SUV\u2019s with terrible suspension, I should have\
  \ been knackered, sleep deprived and hurting in a dozen places. And I was. But one\
  \ sight of the golden paddy fields with undulating forested hills and the rain-washed\
  \ smell of the earth made me feel rejuvenated. The Ziro Festival of Music is attended\
  \ by about two thousand people every day and a total of five thousand people make\
  \ it to the 4-day festival every year. Ziro is home to the Apatani, a tribal people\
  \ living in the area for thousands of years. The Apatani women are very pretty and\
  \ if you google them, you\u2019ll find images showing uncomfortable looking jewellery\
  \ in their nostrils and earlobes. The locals say these customs were started in the\
  \ 12th century when Genghis Khan and his army developed a special wanderlust for\
  \ Apatani women. To prevent kidnappings, women adorned face tattoos and wore nose\
  \ plugs making them look un-desirable, and the practice has continued.\n\nZFM is\
  \ a Zero-waste festival with a morning stage and an evening stage, both made from\
  \ bamboo. In fact, everything from glasses, to plumbing tubes are made using Bamboo.\
  \ The setting and the music is based on the time of day. World renowned and regional\
  \ artists take you through a soulful journey that leaves you filled with euphoria.\
  \ At night, the environmentally friendly campsites become a haven for camaraderie,\
  \ bonfires and an unparalleled camping experience. I also found joy strolling through\
  \ streets of the Mudang Tage village, which is one of the cleanest villages in Asia,\
  \ learning how locals make Kala Apong (Rice beer), Cycling through Sun-kissed hillocks,\
  \ and experiencing first-hand the pisciculture among paddy fields. Everything about\
  \ this valley is a treat for the senses. Right from Mamadou Diabate, also known\
  \ as Madou, a 71st generation musician from Senegal playing the Kora in the early\
  \ afternoon, to the Israeli band Malox singing for world peace and setting the stage\
  \ on fire with Saxophones and Bagpipes, the Featherheads from Nagaland in their\
  \ traditional Tribal attire playing to keep up their cultural heritage and asking\
  \ the youth to stay away from a vile lifestyle, to Komorebi \u2013 the wonder-woman\
  \ from New Delhi who demands your attentive ears as the Accordion and Ukelele guide\
  \ you into an ocean of vocal harmonies and euphoric ambience, there is no dearth\
  \ of talent at Ziro. Whoever you are and whatever your taste in music, there\u2019\
  s something that awaits you here.    \n\nZiro Valley nestled away in plateaus of\
  \ East India paves the way for the New Age. It found me at the early stages of a\
  \ transition in life. It\u2019s a pleasant reminder that underneath all the layers\
  \ and media propaganda, there is a lot of good in the world. I went for a break,\
  \ got lost in the music and never expected to find a new way of life \u2013 connected\
  \ with nature, like a harmonious symphony."
