Text: "\u201CThis is the last call to disembark,\u201D the Cruise Director announced.\
  \ And we were herded off the ship in quick time. Our 10 day cruise had been a disaster.\
  \ Seasickness hit us both, on different sea days, our itinerary was changed due\
  \ to inclement weather and the Canary Islands didn\u2019t live up to expectations.\
  \ And we still had a day to spend in Barcelona. \n\nOn our first 2 days in Barcelona,\
  \ pre-cruise, we crammed in the key sights of the city and hence didn\u2019t get\
  \ to soak in the vibe. It was the first time we had seen a city but not experienced\
  \ it. And this was Barcelona!\n\n\u201CYou better make today count and shut off\
  \ Google Maps,\u201D ordered Leslie, my Filipina wife, as we made our way in an\
  \ Uber to the center of Barcelona to store our luggage.\nAs we left Locker Barcelona,\
  \ the first glimpse of a beautiful sunny Sunday was making its way above. It was\
  \ the last one before Christmas and we were so looking forward for some Christmas\
  \ spirit, our first in Europe.\n\nUnmapped, we decided to navigate the streets at\
  \ leisure, agreeing to access Google Maps late afternoon. The alley was still quiet\
  \ as we headed out on to the boulevard which cut through the heart of the city center\
  \ with one way streets on both sides. The boulevard was warming up as vendors were\
  \ starting to put up their wares. We found a cozy spot in a caf\xE9 and ordered\
  \ our Barcelona favorite, Churros and Hot Chocolate. We spent the better part of\
  \ our coffee time people watching before we decided to cross the one thing on our\
  \ agenda: souvenir shopping.\n\nWe were guided to the Gothic Quarter by the barista\
  \ and soon entered a quaint shopping street. The place was bustling with Christmas\
  \ Carols (in Spanish), people in festive clothes and deals all around. In every\
  \ major European City (and even smaller ones) there is always one gift shop run\
  \ by Indians (and we landed in one!). So Leslie shopped for t-shirts and souvenirs\
  \ as I brushed my Hindi to negotiate a \u2018fair\u2019 price. After an hour of\
  \ \u2018deciding\u2019 by her, we left happy. \n\nBags in hand we continued on our\
  \ merry way and soon reached the Barcelona Cathedral. The square had transformed\
  \ from our visit a fortnight ago with a lively Christmas market with festive goodies\
  \ on display. The smell of fresh pine trees, wood and baked goodies filled the air.\
  \ It was invigorating just soaking this in.\n\nGoogle-less we continued our walk\
  \ to the lovely Placa Reial \u2013 The Royal Square \u2013 surrounded by palm trees\
  \ with a beautiful fountain in the center. The square was wide and was buzzing with\
  \ lunch-time activity as there were many caf\xE9s and bars. As we sat for lunch\
  \ in a caf\xE9 and placed our order the first street entertainer made her way. A\
  \ young gypsy girl sang \u2018Feliz Navidad\u2019 in a sweet voice walking around\
  \ seeking appreciative tips. Later we witnessed some street acrobats by a young\
  \ crew followed by an elderly many doing the flamenco dance. It was difficult not\
  \ to fall in love with him.\n\nAfter a satisfying lunch it was time again to do\
  \ the non-Dubai thing i.e. walk. As we left the square we found ourselves back at\
  \ the boulevard which by now was quite bustling since we left it in the morning.\
  \ The boulevard was now lined with flower stalls selling flowers of all hues and\
  \ smells, kitsch stores and the quintessential of any city center \u2013 street\
  \ art. As we walked towards the Columbus Monument we greeted the many colorful street\
  \ \u2018statues\u2019 who set up shop dressed as fantasy characters. We stopped\
  \ at one of the street artists to do a quick 10-minute caricature of the family\
  \ before heading to Locker Barcelona. It was a good wrap up to our day with a happy\
  \ family caricature.\n\nIn every city, I believe, there is one landmark or street\
  \ that is a microcosm of the city. It\u2019s where the culture, people, eccentricities\
  \ and joie de vivre come alive. In Barcelona, we found it at La Ramblas!"
