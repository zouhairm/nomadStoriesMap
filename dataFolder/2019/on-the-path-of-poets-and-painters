Text: "I was a glob of honey, lying on my yellow Thermarest, sticky and thick. I was\
  \ dozing away my woes. The guy next to me guy was also snoozing, swaying in his\
  \ hammock. At some point, he asked me for the time. I noticed how little he seemed\
  \ to have \u2013 just a jacket and some things at the base of the tree. I was trying\
  \ to get up the courage to make conversation. This guy had a story I was sure; a\
  \ vagabond on a long journey. Best of all, it was the kind of journey that didn\u2019\
  t require him to rise before noon. But then again, I thought to myself, I also wasn\u2019\
  t out of bed by noon.\n\nIt was day five on the Painter\u2019s Way in Germany, promoted\
  \ as a meandering journey through the Elbe Sandstone Highlands in the footsteps\
  \ of poets and painters. I hadn\u2019t found this hike in a glossy magazine, or\
  \ a from a \u201CTop Ten Hikes Around the World\u201D article. I\u2019d stumbled\
  \ across it by pure luck while figuring out something to do, off the beaten track,\
  \ near Berlin. You see, I was freshly graduated and looking for one of those one-way-ticket-no-destination-no-plans\
  \ adventures. A new budget airline had recently opened routes to either Berlin or\
  \ Athens, and I\u2019d picked Berlin because I knew even less about the latter.\
  \ \nI didn\u2019t know it then, but it would be the first hike I didn\u2019t finish.\n\
  \nOh, it had started off so, so wonderfully. It was a Tuesday. There was a real\
  \ painter, painting. He had an easel and a canvas and a funny little hat. He was\
  \ nestled amongst the green gorges; the heart of nature admiring herself. Then,\
  \ it was Saturday, and I was tripping mid-vomit, and lying in the grass feeling\
  \ very sorry for myself.\n\nMy first steps on the 112km Painter\u2019s Way, also\
  \ known as the Malerweg, had felt light and easy and free. I strolled the philosophical\
  \ forests and the gurgling streams in my straw hat. I made Stadt Wehlen by lunch.\
  \ A quaint and quiet town, happy holiday goers ate pizza along the Elbe river, and\
  \ floated down its length on canoes. I felt far away from the world I\u2019d left\
  \ days ago. By late afternoon I was in Hohenstein, famous for the Bastei Bridge.\
  \ Even the busy crowds couldn\u2019t detract from the postcard-perfect sandstone\
  \ formations. \n\nBut I would endure many trials in the following days. My first\
  \ stab at wild camping would be tarnished by my fear of the unfamiliar woods. My\
  \ feet would ache with a pain I\u2019d never known before, a side-effect of the\
  \ heatwave. I would somehow only cover 15km in eight hours, and sit stupidly trying\
  \ to do the Hiker math, over and over, to make sense of it. I would drop my phone\
  \ down the dunny, and along with it all my data and maps. The camp WiFi would fail\
  \ to work, and so I\u2019d have no way to plan my itinerary or contact family. My\
  \ plan to shuttle to and from trailheads every day, from the one campsite on the\
  \ hike, would leave me bound to the buses\u2019 hourly 10am to 5pm schedule. I would\
  \ get lost for an entire morning. Thunderstorms would loom threateningly above.\
  \ And then, of course, I would vomit very spectacularly. \n\nI would wake suddenly\
  \ in the night, scrambling out of my tent and dashing to the toilet block. Halfway,\
  \ I would hurl in a garden bed behind an RV. I would spend the next hour dozing\
  \ at the base of a loo. I would trudge back to my tent and, suddenly, feel sick\
  \ again. I would turn to the stream but misjudge the steep slope and trip, mid-vomit.\
  \ I would lay there, with my nice, new, Gingerbread-coloured Goretex coat, covered\
  \ in vomit. It would be less than a week since I\u2019d left home, 1000km away,\
  \ on a one-way ticket.\n\nAs I lolled around on my thermarest solemnly in the heat,\
  \ reminiscing, I knew I\u2019d had some seriously Type 2 Fun."
