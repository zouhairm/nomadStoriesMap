Text: "As my plane descended through the murky, soup-like air over Bangkok, I wondered\
  \ exactly what I had let myself in for. I\u2019d planned a three week cycling trip\
  \ in the region with friends who were all far younger and far fitter than me.\n\n\
  Thailand is probably not the first place that comes to mind for a trip like this.\
  \ Certainly the capital Bangkok, although quite flat, is not what anyone could describe\
  \ as bike-friendly. Traffic is famously insane and the few bike tracks that do exist\
  \ invariably have cars, trucks and the occasional elephant, parked in them. Often,\
  \ in quieter areas, they will be blocked by people supplicating themselves to wandering\
  \ monks. You can\u2019t exactly sound your horn and shout at them to get off the\
  \ path. Cycling around the centrally located Lumphini Park is a pleasant enough\
  \ experience but, for mysterious reasons, it\u2019s permitted only between the hours\
  \ of 10:00 and 15:00, the hottest time of the day. Riding along Sukhumvit, the main\
  \ artery that runs through the city and all the way to the Cambodian border is always\
  \ a thrill. But only ever consider doing it early on a Sunday morning.\n\nThis wasn\u2019\
  t a short, albeit death-defying, ride around the city.  This time I had signed up\
  \ for a trip through the lesser explored areas of Southern Thailand and Northern\
  \ Malaysia. The plan was to travel by train down to Hat Yai in the south of the\
  \ country and then continue south across the border into Malaysia, terminating our\
  \ trip in Penang on Malaysia\u2019s east coast.\n\nRandom memories:\nTemples, temples,\
  \ temples. All with dogs who have mastered the art of appearing passive and uninterested\
  \ as you approach but will invariably decide, just as you dismount and remove your\
  \ shoes, to go into attack mode. Two thoughts always went through my head when this\
  \ happened; \n - Do they have rabies?\n - Why didn\u2019t I have a rabies shot before\
  \ setting off?\n\nThe nonstop cries of \u201Cwhere you go?\u201D from friendly locals.\n\
  \nEach meal was an experience. Finding places to eat was simple enough, Thais eat\
  \ out often and, once close to any population hub, there would be food stalls and\
  \ restaurants every few hundred yards. Deciding what to eat was even easier, rice\
  \ or noodles?\nInteresting and varied accommodation.  Palatial luxury one night\
  \ and a cramped, windowless room the next. Often the luxury was only on the surface,\
  \ a sumptuous reception area leading off to cell-like rooms.\n\nThe one all consuming\
  \ memory I have of the whole trip is the heat. You probably think you\u2019ve experienced\
  \ hot weather. But until you have tried to cycle at any time after 11:00 in the\
  \ Thai countryside, where the never ending rice paddies offer little protection\
  \ from the unrelenting sun,  you really haven\u2019t. The heat seems to come from\
  \ everywhere - above you, below you, it emanates from inside you. Your head throbs,\
  \ even your hands and feet start to sweat. Very quickly the sun burns any uncovered\
  \ areas mercilessly. Sunscreen has little effect and is soon diluted by the ceaseless\
  \ sweating.\nOne day I exposed my legs and feet to too much sun and a nasty heat\
  \ rash soon developed. I needed to cover up but had no long pants. I also had no\
  \ socks. Unable to protect my lower limbs in a more conventional manner, all I could\
  \ do was wear the two knee support bandages I had with me. Stretched to the limit,\
  \ these covered about one third of my legs. It was a start. A pair of hastily purchased,\
  \ bright pink, knee length, socks - all they had at the local 7-11 store, were added.\
  \ I may have looked ridiculous but I was finally ready to pedal on. I had not intended\
  \ to be the archetypal Englishman wearing socks with sandals but had no choice.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019ve tried to destroy all evidence of this fashion faux-pas. No doubt,\
  \ with the ubiquity of social media I\u2019ve failed and, somewhere on Facebook,\
  \ Instagram or SnapChat, proof still exists of the time I definitely stopped looking\
  \ cool.\n\nLessons learned:\nNext time pack at least one pair of long pants, get\
  \ the rabies shots and maybe consider going on a cruise instead."
