Text: "There we sat, on a un-air conditioned train supposedly heading to Fez. My two\
  \ travel partners and I had our fans out, frantically trying to cool ourselves.\
  \ Our frustration and sweatiness increased by the minute as it became clear our\
  \ train was going to leave much later than originally planned. Most chatter we could\
  \ overhear was in Arabic; finally one man said in English, \u201COnce trains are\
  \ delayed, they can be delayed for hours. Better try again tomorrow\u201D.\nWith\
  \ that, we grabbed our bags and got off the train. Unfortunately, this left us with\
  \ nowhere to go. We threw ideas around as the sun beat down on us- could we still\
  \ try to get to Fez another way by plane or private driver? It was almost 104 degrees\
  \ that day and we were quickly losing the desire to continue brainstorming. We finally\
  \ decided to try to book another night at our riad.\nNour, the riad\u2019s front\
  \ desk manager answered (fittingly, his name means \u201Clight\u201D in Arabic).\
  \ Once he heard our predicament, he immediately offered his house to us so we would\
  \ have a place to stay that night. He also said we could come back to the riad,\
  \ which we decided to do so as not to inconvenience his family. \nWhen we returned\
  \ to the riad, we felt like we were being welcomed home. Nour set up a visit to\
  \ a hammam for us so we could feel well-rested after our stressful afternoon at\
  \ the train station. Hammams are traditional Moroccan baths in which the workers\
  \ bathe, massage, and wash the hair of the clients. It is a beautiful and calming\
  \ experience. \nAs he walked us to the hammam, he said he and the owner always helped\
  \ each other out when needed and that day, it was his turn to call in a favor! Because\
  \ of Nour\u2019s generosity and kindness, my friends and I were able to experience\
  \ the hammam for free (don\u2019t worry, we tipped).  \nOver the next two days of\
  \ extra time we had in Marrakech, Nour and his friends made us a part of their family.\
  \ They took us to the best hookah bar in the city, fed us a delicious dinner at\
  \ a restaurant popular with university students, and, on our final night, we went\
  \ out dancing at his favorite club. \nThe club was called British Pub; we couldn\u2019\
  t figure out why because there wasn\u2019t a fish or chip in sight. The DJ played\
  \ Top 40 much to our American delight and we danced until past midnight. Nour and\
  \ his friends told us it was one of their favorite nights they had ever had. \n\
  We left Marrakech the next day for Chefchaouen, Morocco\u2019s famous blue city.\
  \ We kept Nour updated on our travels through WhatsApp and FaceTime. Once it came\
  \ time for us to leave Morocco for our next destination, we called him from the\
  \ airport and cried, promising each other we would stay in touch and see each other\
  \ again soon. \nNour showed us not only the best of Moroccan hospitality but also\
  \ friendship and love. In addition to offering us a place to stay, he also made\
  \ freshly squeezed orange juice when one of my travel partners started feeling unwell.\
  \ In perhaps the most Nour move of all time, he gave my other friend a lift to Pizza\
  \ Hut on the back of his scooter (some cravings will not be denied). \nFinding a\
  \ friend like Nour can completely change a person. Experiencing that kind of selflessness\
  \ and care from someone I knew mere days made me realize not only am I deserving\
  \ of that kind of love, but that I am also responsible for extending it to others\
  \ just as Nour does. Since my Morocco trip, traveling for me has become more about\
  \ people than places. I want to see all the gorgeous sights our world has to offer,\
  \ and I want to be a \u201CNour\u201D to others I meet along the way."
