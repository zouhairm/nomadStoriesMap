Text: "My father is a no-nonsense accountant and I grew up thinking travel was a frivolous\
  \ expense. I\u2019d only ever travelled to all inclusives with my family, and I\
  \ felt relatively indifferent to the whole \u201Ctravel\u201D thing. \n\nI would\
  \ have never imaged that at the end of my teenage years, I would meet the man I\
  \ would later marry at an all inclusive resort. Moreover, I could have never imagined\
  \ how that man would forever change my relationship with travel. \n\nIn Canada,\
  \ the cheapest place to travel for a week vacation is Cuba. You can easily find\
  \ a deal on flights, food and drinks for less than $1000. As a nineteen year old\
  \ first year University student, I was ready to travel down south for the first\
  \ time without my family. I wanted to sip strawberry daiquiris and eat pizza on\
  \ the beach and that was about as high as my expectations went. \n\nMy friends and\
  \ I googled \u201Cbest party resorts in Cuba\u201D and came across a 3 1/2 star\
  \ resort that seemed to be popular with students on spring break. Using our parents\u2019\
  \ credit cards, we booked our vacation.\n\nThe first night on the resort, my five\
  \ girlfriends and I met about a dozen other Canadians, including a pair of fellow\
  \ Quebecers. We exchanged a few words in French and watched them play beach volleyball\
  \ until we retired to our room. \n\nWe met the pair again at the disco that night,\
  \ and after a strong sip of my rum concoction I pointed at my now-husband, Fred,\
  \ and summoned him onto the dance floor. We spent the rest of the vacation together\
  \ and picked things up where we left off when we both returned home to Quebec. \n\
  \nWhat I didn\u2019t know at the time was that Cuba was the first place my husband\
  \ had ever visitied outside of Canada. It was his first flight. Needless to say,\
  \ neither of us were travellers, but after finding each other on the soft sands\
  \ of Cuba, the travel bug buried itself deep under our skin. \n\nThe more time I\
  \ spent with my partner the more greatful I was for traveling to meet him. Most\
  \ of my friends were in relationships with people from their high school, and they\
  \ didn\u2019t see much farther than their childhood neighbours. I loved discovering\
  \ my boyfriend\u2019s friends and hearing their stories about schools I\u2019ve\
  \ never seen and stores that have long been shut down that I will never see. I adored\
  \ seeing the streets he grew up on, and learning more of the language he spoke.\
  \ Even from my own home province, he was foreign and beautiful to me in a way no\
  \ one I\u2019d ever met was. \n\nBecause of that boy who lived an hour away, I started\
  \ to realize, day by day, how big the world was and how much you miss when you don\u2019\
  t go beyond what you know. \n\nEven though we were from the same province, we might\
  \ as well have been from different worlds. The French / English culture divide in\
  \ Quebec is astronomical and at one point we had locals pull their car over in his\
  \ hometown to swear at us in French for speaking English. Good or bad, I learned\
  \ more about my province, my home and myself. We grew up together, and once we both\
  \ realized how much we had to learn, we couldn\u2019t shake the need to travel more\
  \ in order to experience as much as possible. \n\nI wanted to visit the other end\
  \ of the world, and decided to move to Australia for an exchange semester six months\
  \ into our relationship. Fred joined me half way through my stay and visited the\
  \ continent with me. From that point forward, we\u2019ve visited four continents\
  \ and twenty different countries, including France, China, South Africa and Dubai.\
  \ \n\nEach trip we take we learn more about the world and more about ourselves,\
  \ and none of it would have happened if I didn\u2019t take that all inclusive trip\
  \ to Cuba."
