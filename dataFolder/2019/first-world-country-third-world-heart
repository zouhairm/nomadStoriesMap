Text: "In spring of 2018 I embarked on my first solo international trip. I say solo\
  \ because my travel partner quite literally took off to Perth, leaving me alone\
  \ in Sydney to learn a little bit about myself, and a little more about people.\
  \ Now, I\u2019m an American citizen who\u2019s gone the greater portion of 24 years\
  \ with her head in the sand, (that\u2019s another story, but I chose Australia for\
  \ it\u2019s first world similarities if I\u2019m being honest.) In the last four\
  \ days of my stay, I began to feel unwell. I hadn\u2019t eaten or done anything\
  \ out of the ordinary, but my illness led to my collapse somewhere near Bondi Beach,\
  \ travel bags and all. I wake up cold and sweating in the Aussie heat, my ambulance\
  \ transporting me to Sutherland hospital in Caringbah, New South Wales. I was treated\
  \ remarkably well, by the medics and the doctors, all being extremely young as it\u2019\
  s a teaching hospital. There was an instant connection being that I too work on\
  \ an ambulance here in Stockton, California, though I would trade my view anyday\
  \ for this view. What I wasn\u2019t used to, was being the accent. Being the minority.\
  \ Every time I spoke to answer medical history or things of that nature, the conversation\
  \ was two parts medication, one part \u201COi! What d\u2019ya say about all the\
  \ shootings, love?\u201D or \u201CHow\u2019s it, being ran by the orange tyrant?\u201D\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s a busy ER. There\u2019s TV\u2019s tuned in at every bed and they\u2019\
  re all tuned in to United States business. It\u2019s odd, being on display a little.\
  \ Having the absolute worst parts of your country highlighted on a reel. I mean,\
  \ understandably so. It\u2019s presently happening but still. To try and explain\
  \ to someone who\u2019s never been to to your home that it\u2019s not quite all\
  \ bad media, that parts of it are beautiful. That so many of the people are beautiful\
  \ and kind, progressive and look to the future, and I realize I\u2019ve had this\
  \ conversation myself, many times with people visiting my home or traveling nurses\
  \ where I work. People sort of look to you like you have some sort of personal responsibility\
  \ for where you come from. Maybe they\u2019re onto something; if you\u2019re not\
  \ a part of the solution you\u2019re apart of the problem and that sort of thing.\
  \ People hear argue all the time, everyday, I don\u2019t leave my home and not hear\
  \ about cops or healthcare debate, equal rights or really anything, but it was eye\
  \ opening to be somewhere else where the same debates happen but maybe we could\
  \ take your lead on some things. For instance, being that I\u2019m young and normally\
  \ in excellent health, I didn\u2019t purchase travel health insurance. My bill between\
  \ my transport and my surgery and hospitalization would have bankrupted me at home,\
  \ but under universal Medicare in AU my bill came to maybe 3000 AUD. I couldn\u2019\
  t believe it I almost cried from happiness. I made them read it twice. I also didn\u2019\
  t know that some countries don\u2019t have guns, police officer or not. It just\
  \ wasn\u2019t something I realized was possible before and yet while I was there\
  \ I never saw any act of violence whatsoever. Just people, working together to preserve\
  \ this very clean and very holistic environment. It was amazing. I\u2019m sure you\
  \ can tell by reading this I\u2019m not a well versed traveler. When I picture the\
  \ type of person you select I picture a more bloggy, social warrior who knows far\
  \ more than I do about any given topic. But that\u2019s why I want this, because\
  \ I don\u2019t know, really much about a lot of things. I\u2019m a 911 responder.\
  \ I\u2019m a patient tech in a hospital. I\u2019m a Doula for natural laboring Mama\u2019\
  s. I would love to take the little I know with me, wherever you send me, and return\
  \ home with knowledge ten fold about people, religion, politics, healthcare...all\
  \ of it. I need it. I\u2019m all in."
