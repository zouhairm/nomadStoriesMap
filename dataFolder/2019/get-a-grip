Text: "How did I end up here? I met these people online and I\u2019m supposed to trust\
  \ them with my life?\n\nMy hands are starting to cramp from clinging onto the rock,\
  \ my arms feel like jello after climbing yesterday. It\u2019s fine just don\u2019\
  t look down, don\u2019t look down. Shit. I looked down. A wave of panic and fear\
  \ consumed my entire body in seconds and I was frozen on the spot. This is the highest\
  \ open face climb I\u2019ve ever done-- this is my first time climbing on a real\
  \ mountain. My new friends look like ants, but I faintly hear them cheering me on\
  \ from below. My breathing grew faster and my heart felt like it was going to break\
  \ through my chest. I don\u2019t want to climb down. I made it 80 meters up and\
  \ just past the granite overhang, I can see the top. I\u2019m about halfway there.\
  \ There\u2019s no way I can quit, but I also can\u2019t move. \nI\u2019m hanging\
  \ on slatted granite with little grip or foot support. My only options were to move\
  \ or fall. There\u2019s a small opening to the right and it looks to have better\
  \ grip support for my hand and maybe a space for my feet below. There wasn\u2019\
  t, I lost my footing and fell one meter down. Thankfully, my experienced partner\
  \ Izzy, and my harness, caught me. My fear is at an all time high. I start gasping\
  \ for air, the walls are closing in but I\u2019m outside. I can\u2019t do this,\
  \ I\u2019m a failure I should just give up. I almost lost my life and for what?\
  \ A rock?\nIzzy could sense I was panicking, so she shouted up, \u201CHey Tatiana\
  \ take a rest and look around you. Breathe.\u201D \nLook around me? I was only focused\
  \ on up or down. I pressed my feet against the mountain rock and hung back, already\
  \ feeling a bit more relaxed. When I looked behind me a sense of relief hit me.\
  \ I hung about six meters above the tree skyline and the sea of green trees faded\
  \ into the blue Mediterranean in the distance. The world wasn\u2019t closing around,\
  \ in fact, it was opening. The wind wrapped around me and wiped the sweat from my\
  \ brow as if to calm me down even more. Back home the mountains do not have this\
  \ shade of brown on their rocks nor does the granite feel this warm when you touch\
  \ it. \nThis is my first-time rock climbing and it\u2019s two hours outside of Alicante,\
  \ Spain right next to the Mediterranean Sea. Okay, I can do this. I turn back to\
  \ the rock, the beast that thought it could defeat me -- I\u2019m not giving up.\
  \ \nBelow me, Izzy shouted again, \u201CTry going to the left.\u201D I pull myself\
  \ up and maneuver to the left. She\u2019s right there\u2019s plenty of grips and\
  \ an easier way to get around the overhang. How\u2019d she seen that from so far\
  \ down? How\u2019d I miss that?\nI begin to move with ease and fluidity. Every self-doubt,\
  \ fear, or worry I had disappears with each advancing move. When I finally reach\
  \ the top I can\u2019t stop laughing. Laughing at how I was so close to giving up\
  \ when I could see the top. The wind wraps around me again, I look to the sky and\
  \ not a cloud in sight. One last deep breath before I descend. I can see more of\
  \ the Mediterranean than before, after all the summit is 140 meters high. Not bad\
  \ for a first timer. I descend slowly, reaching the bottom with ease. I leaped from\
  \ the rock unclipped the harness and immediately embraced Izzy. I couldn\u2019t\
  \ stop saying thank you. Thanks for saving my life, thanks for giving me great advice,\
  \ and thanks for being patient with me. Without a doubt, the rhythm changed for\
  \ the rest of the day. The sun shined brighter and the birds chirped louder. Perhaps\
  \ it was the fact that for the first time I had seen myself conquer a mountain --\
  \ nothing could hold me down."
