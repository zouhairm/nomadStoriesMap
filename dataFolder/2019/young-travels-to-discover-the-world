Text: "I want to dedicate my travel story to all the friends and young people around\
  \ who think that the world is only just what they know. I want to motivate others\
  \ to go out and discover the world because you gain so much freedom and love for\
  \ everything around you. You learn about yourself, learn about the world, discover\
  \ new cultures and traditions, and make life changing experiences that are worth\
  \ telling. When I took my first solo trip at the age of 18, all my friends and family\
  \ thought I was crazy. Some thought why would you do that? What\u2019s the point?,\
  \ but after coming back home 3 months later I had truly lived life and I was the\
  \ happiest person while on the journey. I learnt so much through the hardships and\
  \ the good times. I started having hope for the world and loved meeting different\
  \ people all around the globe. I felt like I had a purpose in life to serve which\
  \ was everyone I crossed path with, I wanted to make their day a little bit better\
  \ and share something positive. I want to dedicate this travel the story to all\
  \ the people who want to dream, to all the people who believe they have more to\
  \ do in this world, to all the curious minds and happy souls. I want to write about\
  \ the importance of traveling and how easy it can be to go traveling and I would\
  \ love to encourage others to go and see it by themselves."
