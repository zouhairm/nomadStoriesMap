Text: "The population of Hangzhou is about 6 million, with a greater urban population\
  \ hitting the 9 million mark. In 1991, the city's population was barely half a million,\
  \ but the liberalisation of the economy by President Deng in the 80s led to rampant\
  \ capitalism and commercialisation spreading across China (Zhong Guo, literally,\
  \ \"the middle kingdom\"). The ensuing urbanisation of medium- and larger-sized\
  \ cities has been described as the largest voluntary displacement of any species,\
  \ ever.\n\nSuch rapid growth means cities often struggle to cope with the size of\
  \ their populations, with infrastructure severely lagging behind our neighbours\
  \ in Japan and South Korea. But today, fuck me, if it isn't my lucky day, I've got\
  \ a seat on the Metro for the first time in like a million months and the temptation\
  \ to stay in it until the terminus and back is strong.\n\nBut, places to go, people\
  \ to see... and my destination is Shenzhen, ten bastard hours away. I've got six\
  \ movies on my tablet and several Western newspapers downloaded, I've got music,\
  \ I've got food and drink, and I couldn't be better prepared... but still, this\
  \ promises to be seriously fucking boring. First, however, comes a shitfight...\
  \ I have booked a ticket, but as a foreigner, I can't collect it from the machine,\
  \ as I need to show my passport to a real person. \n\nSo we get to the queue at\
  \ the dreaded Ticket Window 17 - Refunds and Foreigners. Yep, it's the complaints\
  \ window that we're forced to use, my train leaves in an hour and there are quite\
  \ a few people ahead of me. 'Queue'... as a Brit, calling it so won't ever ring\
  \ true; this ain't no orderly patient line, this will take crafty elbows, stern\
  \ looks and... \n\n...and then nothing.\n\n***\n\nComing to my senses I see I'm\
  \ in some kind of back corridor, maybe an office of some kind. It's clear I've fainted,\
  \ this feeling of emptiness and, yeah, the smell of vomit on my clothes is eerily\
  \ familiar. It's been a while and I thought I was over this. While familiar, it's\
  \ really scary in a foreign country and I don't even know the words to thank the\
  \ guy next to me. I can't even tell if he's a Police officer, a ticket inspector\
  \ or a cleaner, we live in the land of ubiquitous officialdom. \n\n\"Lizu Nye?\"\
  . I have no idea what he's talking about. \"Lizu Nye! Smis! Viduka!\" Wait that's\
  \ a word I recognise. Did he really say Viduka? As in Mark Viduka, former centre-forward\
  \ for... \"I lav Lizu Nye\" he continues, pointing at me. It dawns on me. Leeds\
  \ United, my formerly white jersey, now an undescribable colour. This man from a\
  \ background incomparable to mine is telling me we support the same football team.\
  \ \n\nI ask him what happened and he pulls out a mobile phone the size of a birthday\
  \ card. He taps it a few times and holds it out for me to see, and there's a translation\
  \ app displayed. SIR FAINTED. SIR NEED REST. SIR NEED FOOD. His app isn't wrong,\
  \ I haven't eaten since before we hit the pub last night and I'm feeling pretty\
  \ foolish right now. I've missed the train now anyway and Shenzhen, with it's proper\
  \ sweet and sour food, will have to wait. I take the phone, switch the languages\
  \ round, and type in COME WITH ME TO RESTAURANT. \n\nA big smile on his face and\
  \ intermittent mumbles of \"English friend, we eat, Lizu Nye\", we head out to a\
  \ fake local version of Starbucks opposite the railway station. We order up (me\
  \ by pointing at the menu, which is bilingual) and I insist on paying, using the\
  \ AliPay app on my phone. We sit at the tables outside and before even touching\
  \ my beef and cheese croissant I light a cigarette. Seems that my body losing all\
  \ control and rigidity is seriously stressful.\n\nPassing the giant phone between\
  \ us, we reminisce about the Leeds United team of 1999. We're going to watch Hangzhou\
  \ Greentown's match next week."
