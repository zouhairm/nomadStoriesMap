Text: "The smell of petrol mixed with the musty stench of Aymeric. On the back of\
  \ the quad, I tightened my grip as we snarled around the bend into a crisp mountain\
  \ breeze. The view opened up. Infinite lush green Pyrenees. I could finally breathe.\
  \  \n\u201CThis afternoon we go to the neighbors.\u201D Aymeric mentioned while\
  \ we wrangled another bundle of sticks on the muddy shores of the glistening creek.\
  \ It\u2019d been five days since I\u2019d arrived at the farm, my second volunteer\
  \ location. Sawing trees and hammering posts was taxing physically, but far more\
  \ than my lats and traps, I ached for social interaction. \nLess than a mile from\
  \ the front gate, we turned off the main road onto a thin path. Under a thick canopy\
  \ of forest, past a fern-covered floor, we rode. At a rustic two-story home, the\
  \ dirt came to an end.\n\u201CBonjour!\u201D out of an open kitchen door, a mother\
  \ and child emerged. \u201CDavid will be here soon\u201D she said in French. Down\
  \ the steep hillside behind us, a tan shirtless man galloped toward. Gasping for\
  \ air through his big white teeth, he squeezed out \u201CHey! Nice to meet you!\u201D\
  . We got to work hauling wood.\nAt the center of the table, a block of creamy Camembert\
  \ cheese, \u201Cfrom the neighbor\u2019s\u201D, a vine of juicy purple grapes, \u201C\
  from the garden\u201D, and a jar of golden honey, glowed in the afternoon sun. David\
  \ poured me a local amber ale to celebrate the completion of another backbreaking\
  \ task. \u201CThis is from the brewery in St. Girons\u201D Aymeric noted, as we\
  \ sipped from the terrace, enjoying the scene.  \nSweet, yet subtle. \u201CThis\
  \ honey is amazing!\u201D I said. \u201CIt\u2019s from my bees, I\u2019ll show you!\u201D\
  \ David exclaimed excitedly. \nThe air vibrated in all directions. Just inches from\
  \ the row of four wooden hives, we crouched, entirely unprotected. \u201CSo, these\
  \ bees can escape?\u201D I posed the obvious question nervously. \u201CYes, see.\u201D\
  \ David removed a piece of wooden siding revealing a glass panel with a small slit\
  \ at the bottom, and thousands of black and yellow creatures with wings. \n\u201C\
  What made you want to keep bees?\u201D I asked. \u201CThey\u2019re very important\
  \ to nature, and many are dying.\u201D David said thoughtfully. \u201CAnd, they\u2019\
  re so interesting.\u201D He proceeded to explain their traffic to me. \n\u201CSee\
  \ how this one is flying toward that flower for pollen, and how that one is going\
  \ toward the water near the tree. These ones are receiving the supplies and bringing\
  \ it in to make honey.\u201D \n\u201CA hornet it\u2019s called. They capture the\
  \ bees and shred them with their teeth.\u201D \u201CLook, this one here just got\
  \ one of my bees! See him carrying it away to eat on that tree!?\u201D In just three\
  \ minutes, David completely reshaped my perspective of biology. \n\nWithout a single\
  \ sting, we walked back toward the house. At a patch of rice, we paused briefly.\
  \ \u201CI try two different kinds\u201D \u201CJasmine\u201D he held out a small\
  \ green pod in his left hand \u201Cand Sticky\u201D, another in his right. \u201C\
  Very interesting.\u201D I said to him. \u201CYes, but I did not produce enough for\
  \ my family.\u201D he said in his first somber tone. \u201CI will do better next\
  \ year!\u201D He perked back up immediately. \nBack at the terrace, we continued\
  \ chatting. \u201CI used to be a city guy. I\u2019d spend my money on clothes and\
  \ parties.\u201D \u201CMy mother is from Vietnam, and a few years back, I visited.\u201D\
  \ \u201CI learned about self-sufficiency.\u201D He spoke with passion. \u201CAre\
  \ you happier now than you were in the city?\u201D I asked. \u201C1000 times happy!\u201D\
  \ He flashed that smile of big white teeth. \nFrom the kitchen, a child began to\
  \ cry. \u201CI must go my friend but come back any time!\u201D David hugged me and\
  \ said goodbye. \u201CAu revoir!\u201D, his wife shouted from a second-floor balcony.\n\
  The sound of child\u2019s laughter, and the flow of the creek. The scent of wet\
  \ grass, and lemony pine needles. \u201CTylah!\u201D the boys yelled out while chasing\
  \ each other around the lawn. On the terrace, Krystal welcomed me with cake and\
  \ coffee. With a need to socialize now satisfied, I too felt an immense sense of\
  \ happiness from the simplicity and beauty of life in the Pyrenees."
