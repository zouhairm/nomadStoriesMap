Text: "On my twenty-third birthday, I would have been content with a cake. Yet, my\
  \ Korean host family had other plans.  \n\nI lived with a welcoming Korean family\
  \ on Jeju Island as part of my stint as a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant.\
  \ The family was kind and understood my admiration of the beach, but they didn\u2019\
  t know about my fear of what lies beneath the water. As part of my special day,\
  \ my host parents and I drove to the local resort area, where they quickly entered\
  \ the shallow sea pools without reservation. \n\nDonned in sun hats and hiking gear,\
  \ my Korean family squatted among the stones and furiously turned each rock over.\
  \ Every few seconds, I would watch as they picked up an object and then deposited\
  \ it into a bowl. I shivered from uneasiness as I thought of all of the imagined\
  \ sea life swarming around me. \n\nTimidly, I followed and also flipped over a smooth\
  \ rock as the water lapped around the soles of my shoes. My breath halted as I dislodged\
  \ the stone. I was certain that a terrifying sea creature lived underneath, but\
  \ all I found was slime that slid quickly from my fingers.\n\nI thought that perhaps\
  \ if I stood still, this uneasy experience would quickly pass by and we would return\
  \ to the pickup truck and head back home. However, my host mother noticed my reservation,\
  \ stopped her digging, and promptly walked over to me.\n\n\u201CSarah, look,\u201D\
  \ she said in her halted English. She bent down and beckoned me to do so, too. I\
  \ knelt as instructed and watched as she turned over a huge rock covered in thick\
  \ moss and shell fragments. She gasped after a few seconds and her fingers worked\
  \ quickly to retrieve three sea snails - which she proudly cupped in her hand. Within\
  \ moments, the sails found their way into a bucket. \u201COkay,\u201D she said,\
  \ satisfied with her discovery. \n\nI knew this was my cue to do the same.\n\nSwallowing\
  \ my fear, I began to turn over one tiny stone after another. Once I had taken on\
  \ the eyes of my sea-faring host mother, I found snails clinging to the rocks and\
  \ the sand beneath my feet. With each forceful pull, I cautiously plucked the sea\
  \ snails and listened for the tiny clang of their shells hitting the metal bowl.\
  \ \n\nIn the distance, my host parents walked further into the sea. Occasionally,\
  \ I would hear garbled Korean as they sifted through rocks and dried seaweed. As\
  \ I reached down to lift a particularly large stone, I heard a shout in the distance.\
  \ I quickly stood up, balancing myself on the rocks, and looked towards my host\
  \ father.\n\nWith his arm stretched high above his head, a snake-like creature dangled\
  \ from his hands. It wiggled and writhed, snapping its tail in the cold wind. \u201C\
  Sarah!,\u201D my host father shouted, proud of his discovery. My mind raced as he\
  \ walked towards me with the eel. As he stepped closer, I prayed I wouldn\u2019\
  t have to touch the creature. Thankfully, he stopped at the small cooler in the\
  \ middle of the rocks and placed the eel inside. I imagined the eel flopping around\
  \ in the water - just afraid of me as I was of it. I breathed a sigh or relief.\
  \ \n\nAs I continued to overturn stones, my host mother approached me again, this\
  \ time holding an urchin in her gloved hand. Only now, I didn\u2019t feel the familiar\
  \ fight-or-flight response. I only admired the urchin until my host mother crushed\
  \ it on a rock - scooping out its guts for us to eat there on the spot. \n\nAs my\
  \ host mother and I ate the remainder of the urchin, my host father rinsed the snails\
  \ and secured them in a larger bowl. He carried our catches for the day and we walked\
  \ back to the pickup truck, where I sat next to the bowl full of snails and the\
  \ cooler which now held a live eel. As I watched the landscape of Jeju Island pass\
  \ by, I was no longer afraid of what was below the water, but content with my upcoming\
  \ birthday dinner of snails and eel."
