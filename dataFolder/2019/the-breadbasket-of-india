Text: "It was because of an Uber driver on my way to Sydney airport that I\u2019d\
  \ ended up in such strange circumstances. My driver Vic came from an offbeat community\
  \ in Punjab and took great interest in my meticulously planned Indian itinerary.\
  \ I had all the major destinations covered, but Vic callously dismissed the plans.\
  \ He politely argued that I was skimming the surface of a deeper complex cultural\
  \ essence. Daring me to explore beyond the tourist trail, Vic generously offered\
  \ sanctuary in his rural family home.\n\nI accepted his offer. \n\nA few days later\
  \ as instructed I hopped off at an empty Beas train station. Night had fallen, and\
  \ I was approached by a lonesome figure who shook my hand and gestured toward his\
  \ car. He prompted me inside and I brainlessly followed. Our communication was limited\
  \ to thumbs up and smiles, leaving the driver\u2019s identity and our whereabouts\
  \ a mystery. \n\nOur vehicle throttled over the Punjabi savannah\u2019s dirt roads\
  \ which had moon craters for potholes. Every turbulent bump catapulted us into the\
  \ roof. Yet there was an indescribable calm over this arcadian landscape. A calm\
  \ which my anonymous acquaintance did his best to thwart with relentless car horn\
  \ beeping. \n\nHis style of driving reflected India\u2019s lawless every vehicle\
  \ for themselves policy. Our seatbeltless car frantically skidded in and out of\
  \ oncoming traffic showing a total contempt for order. My wobbling arm tightly clutched\
  \ the roof handle until we\u2019d finally reached our destination, Mari Buchian.\
  \ \n\nIn the village centre aloof cows chomped on gutter scraps, and stray dogs\
  \ rested in rubble heaps. Illuminated in the darkness, a crackling fire on the curb\
  \ revealed the deeply lined faces of several skinny old men. They huddled together,\
  \ smoking and loudly cackling at each other\u2019s jokes disturbing the eerie silence\
  \ of the night. \n\nWe eventually came to a stop in front of an imposing iron clad\
  \ gate. It fronted a decadent Indian home. With butterflies in my stomach, I couldn\u2019\
  t have been any more apprehensive. Though whatever I was about to confront was surely\
  \ less treacherous than driving in the car.\n\nHesitantly I stepped out to see a\
  \ mammoth of a man charge toward me with open arms. His bear paw hands affectionally\
  \ squeezed the air from my lungs in a warm embrace. This man was Vic\u2019s father\
  \ Binder. Unable to speak English, he physically communicated a loving kindness\
  \ that\u2019s reserved for family. In an instant Binder\u2019s warmth lulled my\
  \ nerves. \n\nNot a moment after being released from his tight grasp, Vic\u2019\
  s vast and confusing Sikh familial lineage introduced themselves. I was led inside\
  \ for a midnight feast of juicy chicken wings, liver, and metallic tasting kidneys.\
  \ This was washed down with a smoky scotch that was as potent as industrial paint\
  \ thinner. \n\nOver dinner Binder the familial matriarch broadcasted his families\
  \ background and spoke about Mari Buchian\u2019s history. All men in the family\
  \ were military servicemen, except for his youngest who was being groomed to obtain\
  \ a tertiary education. This young boy was the interpreter that bridged our language\
  \ divide. Dismayingly the women of the home were purposefully uneducated. Tragically\
  \ they were made to conform to archaic domesticated gender roles. \n\nHis family\
  \ belonged to a high caste but lived in a region with the largest concentration\
  \ of the depressed caste nationally. Most villagers are economically disadvantaged\
  \ and survive on wheat harvests. Punjab may be nicknamed the \u2018bread basket\u2019\
  \ for its large farming output but many inhabitants still live below the poverty\
  \ line. \n\nBinder claimed that no westerners had ventured through Mari Buchian\u2019\
  s gates since the violent Khalistan secessionist movement in the seventies. I bucked\
  \ the recent trend and thus fulfilled Vic\u2019s challenge to delve into the underbelly\
  \ of Indian culture. \n\nMari Buchian isn\u2019t a destination that\u2019s dreamt\
  \ of by starry eyed travellers. It\u2019s not a place that\u2019s laminated for\
  \ postcards or featured on travel websites. Mari Buchian is a tiny fragment of the\
  \ wider ugliness, beauty, mystery, and allure of a raw rural India. \n\nI retired\
  \ to bed with an ear to ear grin, romanticising over my immediate future. I was\
  \ set to explore the hinterlands soul at daybreak. I was gladdened to know that\
  \ the only certainty was exhilarating unpredictability."
