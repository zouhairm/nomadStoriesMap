Text: "1-7-2019 Krabi, Thailand\nI pledge to explore and ask more questions, to think,\
  \ and to surrender to what presents to me. \nI\u2019m taking some much needed time\
  \ to slow down and reflect during my yoga teacher training. Allowing myself to take\
  \ space has been the hardest and best gift I can give myself. \nMy problem, like\
  \ many people, has been about chasing \u201Csomething.\u201D Once I have that something,\
  \ it will be displaced by something else, contentment isn\u2019t getting or wanting\
  \ though, I think it\u2019s about feeling.\n1-14-2019 \nTime passes differently\
  \ here. The expansion of each moment, although simpler, the depth is greater.\n\
  I\u2019m impressed it is already Friday. It feels like I\u2019ve just gotten here,\
  \ and that I\u2019ve been here forever. My shoulders are sore, probably from all\
  \ of the chaturangas, but maybe also the tension I put to \u201Cfigure it out.\u201D\
  \ \nI\u2019ve never been one for the confines of a schedule, but the practice and\
  \ discipline in daily movement and silencing of the mind in meditation, are just\
  \ what I\u2019ve needed to bring more space and clarity.\nAs I\u2019m exploring,\
  \ I\u2019ve discovered that yoga is more than just movement that we identify it\
  \ as in western cultures, but a mindful way to explore ourselves. We are constantly\
  \ shifting in and out of balance in our attempts to navigate life. Life merely is\
  \ a fluctuating, fluid and beautiful journey and we can choose to appreciate and\
  \ learn from all of the ebbs and flows or we can allow ourselves to suffer. We are\
  \ never given what we can\u2019t handle.\n1-29-2019\nThe more I let go, the more\
  \ I am free. I don\u2019t know what the future holds but I\u2019m choosing not to\
  \ allow my thoughts of past or future to bind me, and keep me somewhere I am not.\n\
  I removed my social media outlets to give myself the opportunity to fully explore\
  \ myself, removing the distractions (relationships) holding me from the present.\
  \ I\u2019m excited because I need something here, and if I don\u2019t pay attention\
  \ to where I am now, I might miss it.\n1-30-2019\nI had many fleeting ideas and\
  \ memories pass yesterday. There\u2019s no sense in attaching to them, but why do\
  \ we fixate and ruminate so much? \n2-1-2019\nI notice the soft wind through the\
  \ trees and the warm air sweep over my body like I remember on summer nights growing\
  \ up. \nI\u2019m finding peace in letting go of heavy distractions of \u201Cthe\
  \ real world.\u201D It feels dirty in a way: the constant stimulation of text messaging,\
  \ and social media posts. I never noticed how I let the sense of other people or\
  \ societal expectations influence my choices and feelings. I hope eventually I can\
  \ bridge that gap of living in a material world and setting boundaries to stay connected\
  \ to myself. \n2-7-2019\nFor whatever reason, I felt like I wanted to connect again\
  \ to people in the U.S. One person I messaged, commented how it didn\u2019t seem\
  \ that I had disconnected very long. It felt like a hard punch in my gut. I look\
  \ at the dates of my journal entries, it really has not been long.\nI can\u2019\
  t rush the power of what comes in moments of silence and space. As good as I feel,\
  \ there is more work to be done. Thanks for the reality check.\n2-19-2019 Chiang\
  \ Rai, Thailand\nI don\u2019t know how to describe it, but I have this deep sense\
  \ of contentment. \nI\u2019m sitting on the mountain side, on a grass ledge made\
  \ by the workers of the coffee farm. Relishing in the warm rays of the afternoon\
  \ sun. I came to volunteer on the farm for the past week, in exchange for room and\
  \ board, but to be honest, for another adventure. \nIn less than a week I will be\
  \ heading back to the U.S. I\u2019m ready, merely for the fact that I\u2019ve been\
  \ present to where I am the last two months.  \nI laugh to myself, thinking my thoughts\
  \ are pretty similar to those from just a few weeks ago. I was right, but now I\
  \ feel it. Little by little the fabrics of my life have been composed by the results\
  \ of my surrendering to each experience."
