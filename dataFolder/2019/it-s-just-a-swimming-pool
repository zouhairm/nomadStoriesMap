Text: "I knew on our glorious three-week adventure to Peru that I wanted to do something\
  \ exhilarating that would force me out of my comfort zone. Booking the trip was\
  \ easy enough, but once I arrived at Cusco's Action Valley Adventure Park to go\
  \ bungee jumping, my knees buckled under me.\n\nMy fragile, twenty-two-year-old\
  \ body would be just fine plummeting 410 feet to the earth and flailing through\
  \ the air like a rag doll, right? I couldn't just back out. The whole ordeal was\
  \ already paid for, so I was basically trapped without a prayer. I preach spontaneity,\
  \ growing through experience, trying new things, and taking the plunge, and here\
  \ I was questioning if I could do all of this myself. \n\nWhen it was our turn to\
  \ go up into the red metal box in the sky, the enthusiastic park operators made\
  \ us do a few short exercises to get our blood pumping and our hearts racing (as\
  \ if they weren't already). I made my husband, Tyler, go first as I laid on the\
  \ ground somewhat underneath the spot he'd be leaping from. It didn't seem to take\
  \ him that long to muster up enough courage to make the jump. As I watched the rope\
  \ tied to his harness bounce and jolt every which way, he seemed to be having the\
  \ time of his life. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad?\n\nAs I readied up, the instructors\
  \ made the cautious decision to fit me with two neck braces instead of one. This\
  \ was fine. Everything was fine. I dragged the heavy bungee cord attached to my\
  \ legs and stuffed it into the box as myself and two other staff members slowly\
  \ rose into the sky. The jagged Andes Mountains became more and more visible as\
  \ they stretched into the distance and found the horizon. One of the men asked me\
  \ a series of questions that were mainly plugs to create hype for their park as\
  \ he filmed me for a video I could purchase afterwards. I told my parents I loved\
  \ them like it was the last time I'd ever get to do so. I watched with a sickly\
  \ smile as we reached the maximum height and I was briefed on how to properly jump.\
  \ \n\nI walked the plank, always keeping a firm grip on something nearby, and you\
  \ can see how visibly shaken I am in the video at the sight. After backing away\
  \ and heading back into the cage several times while being told, \"Rachael, come\
  \ on\" by someone I didn't know, I closed my eyes and envisioned a swimming pool.\
  \ My brain's defense mechanisms were working overtime, because that was the most\
  \ realistic swimming pool I'd ever seen. I spread my feeble wings, jumped out, and\
  \ all the air was sucked out of my lungs from the force of gravity. \n\nSeven seconds\
  \ later, after I had uttered a stifled scream that sounded like an old man wheezing,\
  \ I was bouncing in slow motion through the air. I was flying, but not the kind\
  \ of flying that superheroes enjoy. This was the kind of flying where you're a blind\
  \ bat hurtling into the darkness with uncontrollable directional shifts (my eyes\
  \ were still closed). Tyler was laughing heartily down below me, and there was a\
  \ group of Peruvian kids playing paintball nearby who all stopped and cheered for\
  \ me. I felt positively badass. \n\nAfter that, Tyler and I decided to try the Slingshot,\
  \ which is just a reverse bungee jump where you're propelled forcefully into the\
  \ air. I thought that would be less frightening since you initially begin on solid\
  \ ground, and I was wrong. Both experiences were literally breathtaking, entirely\
  \ nerve-racking, and I'm still not even sure if it was all just a foggy dream sequence.\
  \ Ever since that day, I feel like I can take on any challenge I'm faced with. Whether\
  \ the issues be big or small, real or otherwise falsely constructed by our own minds,\
  \ we can do hard things. Peru was a beautiful example of how deep-seated culture\
  \ and adrenaline-fueled fun can merge into the perfect trip. \n\nThe world is just\
  \ a swimming pool to dive right into if we have the courage."
