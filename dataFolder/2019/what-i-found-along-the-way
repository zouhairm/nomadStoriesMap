Text: "I certainly didn\u2019t expect to find a dead man on the West Highland Way.\
  \ I had more hoped to spend my Scottish vacation walking a rainbow-studded route\
  \ while enjoying warm, dry sleeping arrangements and abundant Fish and Chips. On\
  \ those aspects The Way in fact delivered, but we didn\u2019t count on the addition\
  \ of an intense reckoning with the fragility of life.\n\nThe morning of day 4 found\
  \ my husband Chad and I navigating a rocky section of trail in the spitting rain.\
  \ To our left was the famed Loch Lomond and to our right a sheer cliff measuring\
  \ several hundred feet. Ahead of us we saw two young women standing single file\
  \ on the narrow trail. They seemed unprepared for the bitter conditions, soaked\
  \ to the bone as they were in their shorts and tank tops. One held a telephone to\
  \ her ear. Several yards beyond them lay a man. In what felt like slow-motion, my\
  \ subconscious and then my conscious brain picked up on the utter lack of movement\
  \ coming from the man. Fresh from a recent Wilderness First Responder recertification,\
  \ I quickly ascertained that the pair had been out running and found this man in\
  \ his present condition just moments prior. They were too shocked and uncertain\
  \ to fully approach him. \n\nI set down my pack and picked my way past the runners.\
  \ I had to kneel practically on top of him due to the lack of usable space on the\
  \ cliffside. He was wiry and middle aged with gray facial hair that was neatly shaped\
  \ into a goatee. It looked as if he had sat down on a protruding rock and then simply\
  \ leaned back on his impeccably clean, old-fashioned looking backpack. His eyes\
  \ were wide open and his skin a waxy white. \u201CSir?\u201D I said loudly as I\
  \ gave his shoulder a firm tap. Nothing. Every intuition asserted that the person\
  \ occupying this body had fully departed. \n\nI put my ear to his open mouth, laid\
  \ a full palm on his warm chest, and waited, failing after several seconds to detect\
  \ breath or heartbeat. I gingerly removed his hat and did a quick check around his\
  \ head and neck. No obvious injuries. I peeked underneath his sensible clothing\
  \ layering system and did not find any blood or bruises.\n\nBy now other hikers\
  \ had started to arrive. Without a safe way to bypass the scene, a somber line of\
  \ onlookers formed. The runners had started to shiver. Chad reached into our packs\
  \ and produced extra jackets.  \n\nA connection was finally achieved with Emergency\
  \ Services. They asked if I knew how to perform CPR. I did. Chad helped me remove\
  \ his backpack to lay him as flat as we could. He also set up a small tarp above\
  \ his head to relieve him of the indignity of the rain pooling in the corners of\
  \ his eyes. I began chest compressions, grateful that modern CPR no longer calls\
  \ for mouth-to-mouth breathing. \n\nAnother hiker made his way over to take turns\
  \ performing chest compressions. His seasoned demeanor belied his youthful appearance.\
  \ The cramped cliffside required a bit of clinging with all three of us there.\n\
  \nI took the opportunity to find the man\u2019s wallet. David Macdonald, 65 years\
  \ old, Canadian. A spot in my chest ached for David\u2019s loved ones back in Canada.\
  \ He was so far from home and surrounded by strangers. I spoke to him gently and\
  \ sincerely: \u201CDavid, my name is Lisa. I\u2019m here with you.\u201D \n\nWe\
  \ heard the helicopter first, then the boat. It took the rescuers longer to heave\
  \ up the muddy bank than it did to pronounce Mr. Macdonald dead. A dazed quiet prevailed\
  \ as packs were collected, jackets returned, and those of us with breath left in\
  \ our bodies continued the journey.\n\nLater that day the sun came out. I saw my\
  \ CPR buddy in a grassy meadow and we properly introduced ourselves. Upon hearing\
  \ that I was from the USA, he smiled widely and threw his arms open: \u201COh, we\
  \ are enemies! I am from Iran!\u201D We embraced not only each other, but a heartfelt\
  \ respect for life, death, Mr. David Macdonald, and a day none of us could have\
  \ expected."
