Text: "I have never been out of my country in my entire life.\nKorea, has always been\
  \ my dream country to visit and Kpop was the triggered. Hallyu is one of great phenomenon\
  \ of culture wave that go all over Asia. My country which always been open to culture,\
  \ embrace it, and just enjoying it. Indonesia is where I am from.\nLoving Korean\
  \ things as hobby is usual but it turned out to be more passionate and that one\
  \ decision in life finally brought me to Korea last summer. My major is Korean Language\
  \ and Culture at Universitas Gadjah Mada has a lot of connection to Universities\
  \ in Korea that gave me the chance to go to Korea for Summer Program.\nKongju National\
  \ University Summer Program, Food and Accommodation covered by KNU and that\u2019\
  s it! I am so going there. My first time ever going abroad and I was alone. \nArrival\
  \ at CGK international airport made my jaw dropped. It was my first time in international\
  \ airport! Then, I saw how big KLIA that made me lost for words and it cant be compared\
  \ to ICN International that make me felt stupid for thinking CGK was big.\nIt was\
  \ my adventure alone, from Jakarta to Gongju. My late arrival because of Visa problem,\
  \ My almost-left-out-in-airport drama, and nervousness I felt in immigration became\
  \ unforgettable memory of that journey.\nNo one picked me up, so I was using bus\
  \ from Incheon straight to Gongju. It took roughly 2 hours and by the time I arrived\
  \ in Gongju Bus Terminal, I went to eat cup noodles. Not long after that, I met\
  \ miss Pyunghwa and she took me to university\u2019s dorm. \nThe next day was the\
  \ first day of tour. Unfortunately I skipped all in class program and just come\
  \ at exact time for tour. We went to Baekje Cultural Land that is the replica of\
  \ the kingdom located in Buyeo. We just listen to tour guide there while enjoy walking\
  \ around for 30 minutes. We actually had to go to Jeonju Hanok Village right away\
  \ but we got chance to visit Lotus Festival along the way after tour guide suggested\
  \ it. We did not spend to much time there and heading for Jeonju right away. It\
  \ was raining when we got there so we ate Bibimbab for lunch before going around\
  \ Jeonju with another tour guide.\nIt was challenge for me because I have some food\
  \ restriction, so they made mine without any kind of meat. This was not the first\
  \ time I struggled with food, as a muslim it kinda hard to traveling, mainly because\
  \ of food and praying time. The schedule is tight and I didn\u2019t really had choice\
  \ for praying time. So I did it mainly in bus.\n\nSecond day we got to experience\
  \ to learn pansoori (Korean traditional music) and making process of injeolmi (korean\
  \ food made from rice covered with peanut powder). After making injeolmi we have\
  \ a bit free time to play in river and back to dorm early than usual. We used this\
  \ chance to eating out with some korean friends. I never expected they would have\
  \ some drinks, so I spent most of the time watching everyone drinking alcohol with\
  \ some games going on. I just used that chance to learn new things.\n\nThe last\
  \ day in Korea probably most tight schedule we had. We went to Korean Folk Village\
  \ located in Yongin, then heading to Kyungbokgung Palace in Seoul. I made friends\
  \ with KNU Students who going tour with us because we are same age. I spent most\
  \ of my time from Korean Folk Village, Kyungbokgung, Insadong and Hongdae with them.\
  \ We talked a lot while walking around Insadong and Hongdae. \n\nIt was really great\
  \ short journey, even though I am having hard time to adjust in Korea, there is\
  \ always way to do that if you trying hard. My struggle with food and praying time\
  \ in country like Korea made me realize that I have to manage my own and this wont\
  \ be my last time struggling. Being in bus going to Incheon Airport made me remember\
  \ about home and how I missed the food."
