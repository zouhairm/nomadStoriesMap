Text: "\u2018Call me Paulo\u2019, said Dottore Millemaci, in Italian, of course. I\
  \ was pleased he had not addressed me in English, as people so often did here, for\
  \ it meant today I could practise speaking Italian.\n\nWe met in the car park beside\
  \ Lake Maggiore at 9am, as arranged. He told me that he could drive us up the valley\
  \ as the roads were rather winding. Before we headed off, we had a quick expresso\
  \ in a local cafe, where Paolo seemed to know almost everyone inside. I poured a\
  \ sachet of sugar into mine and watched as the granules lingered on top of the crema\
  \ for an instant before sinking down into the hot liquid. I had once been told (by\
  \ an Italian, of course) that this was the measure of a good coffee.\n\nThe doctor\
  \ drove us out of the town and away from the lake, up into the Valle Cannobina.\
  \ He asked me about my research and how I had first heard about the village, and\
  \ I in turn asked him about his work. He was a geologist and so told me all about\
  \ the valley and how it had been formed and what types of rocks there were. He then\
  \ went on the compare the landscape here with my own homeland, Scotland. I asked\
  \ him if he had ever visited, but he said that he hadn\u2019t, but hoped to one\
  \ day.\n\nAs we drove, the valley glistened with what Paulo told me was the first\
  \ snow of the year. The trees all sparkled and the sides of the valley where so\
  \ bright. It felt like driving into some magical deserted land and we passed only\
  \ the occasional small village perched precariously on one of the ridges. For a\
  \ moment I imagined that I was back in Scotland and, looking out onto the rocky\
  \ valley on that snowy January morning, I felt right at home. \n\nNearing the village,\
  \ we passed a huge \u2018Welcome/Benvenuti\u2019 sign with a saltire painted across\
  \ it, impossible to miss. Clearly there was nothing subtle about the village\u2019\
  s connection with Scotland and they were enthusiastic to share their cultural links.\
  \ \n\nWe continued to zig zag our way up into the village until we stopped in the\
  \ main piazza: a tiny square containing a church, a bar and a small museum with\
  \ another Scottish flag flying proudly out the window, alongside the Italian. Our\
  \ first stop was the bar. Inside, again, the doctor appeared to know everyone and,\
  \ this time, started introducing me to them as \u2018la ragazza scozzese\u2019 (\u2018\
  the Scottish girl\u2019) which I liked very much.\n\nIn the town hall, I met the\
  \ mayor of Gurro. He was a very jolly looking man with a fantastically eccentric\
  \ moustache and when we took pictures together he wore his mayoral sash, which made\
  \ me feel very important, as I did again when I was told that the photos would likely\
  \ appear in the local newspaper. The mayor recounted to me the Scottish legend of\
  \ Gurro, that in the 16th Century Scottish soldiers were left trapped in the valley\
  \ during a harsh winter but, come spring, decided to settle there due to the surrounding\
  \ conditions reminding them of their own Bonnie Scotland. Of course, he didn\u2019\
  t use the phrase \u2018Bonnie Scotland\u2019, but I like to use that phrase when\
  \ I tell the story. \n\nI was shown around the museum in which there were many examples\
  \ of local garments resembling tartan and an old set of bagpipes. In the local bar,\
  \ newspaper cuttings were stuck up which had been written about the interesting\
  \ history of Gurro, some in English and others in Italian. Many of the people I\
  \ met told me about their surnames being of Scottish origin and told me of family\
  \ members that had visited Scotland. I asked them many questions about their village\
  \ and, in return, told them about the beauty of my own country.   \n\nI felt inspired.\
  \ I wanted to tell everyone I knew, both Italian and Scottish, about this wonderful\
  \ treasure that I had unearthed but, at the same time, I selfishly indulged myself\
  \ in feeling that this magical place hidden in the snowy Italian mountains belonged\
  \ just to me."
