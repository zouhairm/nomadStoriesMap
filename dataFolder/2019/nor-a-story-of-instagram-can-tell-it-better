Text: "I was coming back from Greece where my expectations about the country They\
  \ were very high given its history, art and culture. I expected to find Zeus and\
  \ Aphrodite, having only a bittersweet taste since I only met the god of garbage\
  \ through its dirty streets and the goddess of graffiti.\n\nSo I arrived with a\
  \ very low for the next destination is where is not spoken much in my country, only\
  \ relates to terrorism and insecurity, My first contact with the country was not\
  \ very gratifying, people trying to enter the country first. Followed by that my\
  \ passport had been forgotten on the plane, my friend with whom I was traveling\
  \ had lost who had my wallet, I had no money and starvation, my trip could not \"\
  start better\". I had to be creative,\n1st get my passport, it was not as much trouble\
  \ as I thought, I went to the airline spoke to the crew and resolved the issue,\
  \ 2nd I had to eat but how?, I found in fast food  a burger , left by a traveler\
  \ who would soon have to leave, so I ate it. 3\xBA when I was eating  it, on the\
  \ side, I saw  Ana, a Brazilian girl just arrived to Istanbul, I told her what had\
  \ happened and We agreed that if I borrowed money from her, I would compensated\
  \ it with a good tequila that I had.\n\nStep 4 let me be surprise:\nI arrived at\
  \ the hostel where I met my friend, my things and I was able to get some sleep.\
  \ At night, my ears had the first contact with the Turkish culture, the Koran woke\
  \ me up, because every certain hour they make it sound in the mosque of every mosque\
  \ that is in the city (I admit Hollywood got into my head with all those movies\
  \ that do not paint the reality of a country so surprising and where Islam is associated\
  \ with terrorism).\n\nWe resorted to Istanbul where in every corner a merchant the\
  \ masters in selling offered you his carpets, fabrics, or pashminas, no matter where\
  \ you were from, they found the way to know your country and sell you something,\
  \ then We met the imposing blue mosque by itself, surprising architecture and its\
  \ marvelous tiles, from there we followed the hippodrome of Constantinople, we passed\
  \ through the plateau of Topkapi is a museum, but less than one hundred years ago\
  \ it was still the home of the sultan, his harem and his servants, followed by the\
  \ church of Saint Irene, G\xFClhane Park, the basilica cistern and the mosque of\
  \ Saint Sophia, all the way walking, my eyes not they only saw clean streets and\
  \ friendly people, but also tulips, trees and more colorful flowers decorated throughout\
  \ the journey to the city and its structures leaving a very pleasant experience\
  \ while I was walking.\n\nI arrived at the Galata tower, and when I climbed, it\
  \ was where I could understand the significance of their country, where Asia and\
  \ Europe meet, and it is translated into the many species, food, handicrafts etc.\
  \ that you can find inside the Big Bazaar.\n\n2 days passed, Cappadocia my next\
  \ destination, a place so special, is its landscape, which seems out of a story.\
  \ Formed by valleys and capricious conical rocks sculpted over the centuries by\
  \ wind and rain, mysterious underground cities and stone churches. There I met a\
  \ Spanish couple , we climbed to an aerostatic balloon that every morning you can\
  \ buy and we agreed on several things: very good breakfast, cheap hotels, warm people,\
  \ and that the Turks are the kings of the world at the time of selling, (a Turkish\
  \ rug could already boast them).\n\n5th step you want to have good photos and more\
  \ followers in IG, here you can get it, it is true to be a Muslim country the nightlife\
  \ and the alcohol are restricted, but they are not necessary. Turkey made me forget\
  \ that and I would like to know  more.  so  4 more days passed of a very good trip\
  \ and it is not enough for me to write it if you do not live it. \n(PS: Ana received\
  \ her shot of tequila)"
