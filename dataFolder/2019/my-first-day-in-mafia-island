Text: "It was early in the morning when i got into the Island after the long trip\
  \ all night long from the main land,It was just finished to rain when i was just\
  \  got into the Island,the smell of the Soil after the rain it was amazing, I didn't\
  \ felt any tired though it was a boat trip,I was so excited to be in the Mafia Island,the\
  \ Island with the five Island in it,\n \n\nI went to the local guest house to get\
  \ a room  at Kilindoni ..that was a small town  in Mafia, I entered to the room,\
  \ put my bag  down ...and laid down on the bed when my shoes still on,Started thinking\
  \ how to spend this first day in the Mafia Island, was thinking how is this place\
  \ looking like at  the noon time or at the night and the midnight...and suddenly\
  \ i fall into sleep.\n\nAround  10;00 AM, somebody woke me up by knocking at my\
  \ door,she was a house keeper wanted to clean the room and i told her that i entered\
  \ this early Morning, so she said Sorry and left, there was  no bed and break fast\
  \ there, so i supposed to go out to get a breakfast , people  of Mafia was looking\
  \ different from People of main land where i belong, 70+% from Mafia are Muslims\
  \ so most of them they dress like Muslims does and they depends on marine activities\
  \ and farming, I had white  Snapper Fish soup with Chapati as a breakfast and it\
  \ was super yummy,  I ask around where do the people likes to go and have fun in\
  \ Mafia and i was told it's good if i will go to Utende village,then i decided to\
  \ go..i took the public transport from Kilindoni up to Utende,the only trees i saw\
  \ when i was on my way was a coconut trees,i saw a lot of mosques, and it felt good\
  \ to experience new things,\n\nSo it was like 40 minutes drive from Kilindoni up\
  \ to Utende, then we made a stop close to the Indian Ocean...I saw some people selling\
  \ different fishes around,some artist doing their painting,i saw some tourists walk\
  \ down to the beach  then i decided to take a walk alone alongside the beach, i\
  \ saw  the beach Bar and i walked there \"Mambo\" I greet Mr Bar Man,,,,and he Said\
  \ \"Poa\" and I ordered Pinacolada Cocktail and I went to sit on the beach bed,\n\
  \n\"Hi there\" She Said a lady on the beach bed next to me then I said \"Hi\"\n\
  She was a white woman laid down on the beach bed  she had a pink bra and pink bikini,\
  \ I introduced myself that my name is Prosper  she Said her name was Miriam and\
  \ I asked if there any different between Miriam and Mariam  and she said Yes Mariam\
  \  means Marry the Mother of Jesus but Miriam was the elder sister of Moses,she\
  \ composed a song of victory to God in celebration,She then leads the women in dance\
  \ while she sang to them after crossing the Red Sea, I was impressed to hear that\
  \ story because i didn't know that before, then I smirked,...\n\nand I asked her\
  \ again what did she likes the most in this life, she look at me in the eyes with\
  \  a big smile on her face then she said to me ..I really don't like material things,\
  \ I only enjoy to see the sun set and the sun rise because that means a lot to me,\"\
  \ wooow\" she made me smile because I have never thought she will Surprise me with\
  \ those kind of answers to me,\n\nwhile I was Smiling there ,somebody touched my\
  \ shoulder \"Excuse me Sir,I am Jason and Miriam is my wife,how can she Smile at\
  \ you  while she didn't smile even talking  to me for a month now\"I was wondering\
  \ where is this man come from because i didn't see him coming\n\nI didn't have a\
  \ chance to introduce myself to Jason, He held Miriam's hand then they walked away\
  \ without talking to each other...She waved at me..I waved at her...I paid for my\
  \ Cocktail then I said Louder...\"What a beautiful day in Mafia island\"."
