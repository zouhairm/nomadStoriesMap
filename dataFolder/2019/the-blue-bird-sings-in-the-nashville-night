Text: "Until last year my exposure to country music was limited. The gravelly tones,\
  \ poignant melodic structures and raw, truthful lyrics always seemed old-fashioned,\
  \ like music from another time. \n\nYet, every morning, on a trip driving overland\
  \ across the breadth of the USA there was nothing that would have set the tone as\
  \ well as Willie Nelson\u2019s \u2018On the road again.\u2019 Somehow, that song\
  \ was an expression of the restlessness that compels an individual to travel, to\
  \ leave a place that they know, to explore the unknown.\n\nBefore the trip I had\
  \ developed a surface appreciation for country music via the television show Nashville.\
  \ The series features The Blue Bird Caf\xE9 in various episodes and presents it\
  \ as the epitome of true, honest, country music. \n\nThe Blue Bird Caf\xE9 opened\
  \ in 1982 and seats 90 with over 70,000 people making the pilgrimage every year.\
  \ Tickets for shows at The Blue Bird Caf\xE9 are now notoriously hard to get due\
  \ to the renewed fame of the venue. \n\nThe night I visited I had no ticket. However,\
  \ I had read in numerous travel anecdotes that if you were lucky, you might get\
  \ a seat in the un-ticketed old church pews, but only if you were in the first twelve\
  \ people to line up. This is what I was trying to do. I wanted to see this place,\
  \ to experience it, to know what it felt like to be there. \n\nThere were already\
  \ people in line when I arrived. I nervously slotted in behind the last person and\
  \ looked around. It was very unassuming. Aside from the famous blue awning I could\
  \ have been lining up outside a bakery.\n\nIt was over an hour before the doors\
  \ opened and a hostess popped outside. She wasn\u2019t surprised to see us standing\
  \ there despite the hot Nashville sun making it quite uncomfortable.\n\nThe next\
  \ half an hour was pure nervous anticipation as the hostess allowed people inside\
  \ group by group. When I got to the front of the line I was sweating, both from\
  \ the sun and the proximity to victory. \n\nThe sense of relief when I was allowed\
  \ inside was immense and made me realise the level of investment. The second host\
  \ smiled when I entered. I imagine my feelings were written all over my face. \n\
  He asked, \u2018where are you from?\u2019\nI said, \u2018Australia!\u2019\nHis smile\
  \ broadened and he told me his sister was living in Australia as he waved me in.\
  \ \n\nI sat on the end of one of the old church pews next to a young family and\
  \ let my eyes wander freely around the room. It was small and not in any way opulent\
  \ given the stars that occasionally graced the venue, but it had a sense of presence\
  \ that you can\u2019t manufacture. \n\nThere were fairy lights draped on the wall\
  \ across from me and a neon blue bird. Even empty the room sang. The walls were\
  \ covered in full-sized portraits of legendary artists as well as murals of polaroid\
  \ profiles and signed messages. It was intimate and authentic in a way that your\
  \ room is as a teenager. This was a room that captured the music of every individual\
  \ who had ever performed there. The feeling is hard to put into words, it can only\
  \ be experienced.\n\nSmall round wooden tables were set up across the floor centring\
  \ on a round of chairs and microphones that were obviously designated for the musicians.\
  \ That night there was going to be an \u2018In the Round\u2019 with songwriters.\n\
  \nThe ticketed guests started arriving and took their seats at their little circle\
  \ tables. Then the songwriters arrived. They sat together and chatted as they prepared\
  \ their guitars. The atmosphere was light, airy and at the same time there was a\
  \ hum of respect and anticipation. \n\nI think this moment, just before the musicians\
  \ begin, best represents the idea of The Blue Bird Caf\xE9 as a listening room.\
  \ These days I find so many things accompany the practice of listening to live music\
  \ but here, it was simply a place to listen, a safe place to be completely and utterly\
  \ a music lover. For that feeling alone, it was a place worth traveling too."
