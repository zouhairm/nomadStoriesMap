Text: "Reading break was the perfect opportunity for the international students of\
  \ Stirling University to scatter across Europe, seeking the most memorable travel\
  \ experiences they could find. But of all the plans that I heard discussed, mine\
  \ were somehow both the simplest and the craziest. \n\nI did not take any airplanes,\
  \ did not country-hop or explore sprawling cities. Yet who goes to Orkney in February?\
  \ Tucked far away in the North Sea, the cluster of islands is considered remote\
  \ even during the bustling summer months when archaeologists and tourists alike\
  \ flock north. In February, I was one of the only tourists on the islands. When\
  \ I took the local buses, the drivers gaped at me because they had not dropped anyone\
  \ off at those stops for months. The Historic Scotland tour guides chatted to me\
  \ on one-person tours that would normally have been twenty-person. The ancient monuments\
  \ were empty but for locals walking their dogs.\n\t\nIf you have been to Orkney\
  \ in the summer, you will know that the landscape is dotted with standing stones\
  \ and ancient burial cairns, ruined villages and archaeology digs. But unless you\
  \ have gone in the winter, you will not know what it feels like to stand among the\
  \ Stones of Stenness with no one for company but the sheep that graze between the\
  \ stones. You will not have to take shelter from the pouring rain inside a 3000-year-old\
  \ Neolithic burial cairn on the side of a deserted, lonely hilltop. You will not\
  \ know what the Ring of Brodgar feels like when there is no one there to hear you\
  \ sing the Skye Boat song among the sacred stones.\n\t\nIf you have been to Orkney\
  \ in the summer, you will know that it is home to small, isolated communities. But\
  \ you will not know that Ceilidh dancing takes place throughout the winter every\
  \ Monday, and that the old ladies who attend will attempt to recruit you to their\
  \ weekly dances. You will not know that on rainy February evenings, the local Lonely-Planet-recommended\
  \ pub will be empty but for a few old islanders with nothing to do but talk to the\
  \ foreigner who they cannot believe came all this way.  You will not know what the\
  \ local dialogue sounds like, because nobody will assume that you're a local and\
  \ try to talk to you in it.\n\t\nIf you have been to Orkney in the summer, you will\
  \ know the islands' rolling green hills and steel grey waters, soft sand beaches\
  \ and dramatic cliffs. But you will not know what the fields look like glistening\
  \ with raindrops and stretched out underneath the largest rainbow you have ever\
  \ seen. You will not know what the wind sounds like when it rushes over the tops\
  \ of metal fences so violently that it makes the hollow poles sing strange songs.\
  \ You will not know what the ocean looks like when it is tossed into stormy, ice\
  \ blue waves that crash against the rocks with wild ferocity. And you will not know\
  \ what it feels like to dive under the freezing waters of the North Sea on a deserted\
  \ sandy beach in February.\n\t\nI come from a small island community 6,900 kilometres\
  \ away from Orkney, nestled in the waters off the west coast of Canada. Every small\
  \ community is unique, and yet there is a universality to them. The local teenagers\
  \ sing Queen songs in the back of the bus on the way home from school. The old ladies\
  \ meet in community halls to dance. The buses are on \"island time\". Cars stop\
  \ to ask you if you want a ride, or just to make sure that you're okay.\n\t\nIn\
  \ the end, my reading break trip wasn't about seeing the exotic or the strange.\
  \ It wasn't about a quest to see the northern lights or a longing to investigate\
  \ the history of the Vikings. Deep down, it was about finding home, reflected back\
  \ to me in a distorted mirror crafted out of the North Sea and the wild winds that\
  \ rush across Scapa Flow. It was about finding something familiar in a corner of\
  \ the world far from home."
