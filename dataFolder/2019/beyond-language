Text: "Myself and my beloved friend Lauren has just arrived In Bosnia by coach after\
  \ drinking in the rich bredth and depth of the Bosnian natural landscape. We felt\
  \ slightly bewildered yet hopeful for the next few days. It was after midnight and\
  \ we felt anxious to get into a bed for the night so we began to look for options.\
  \ Immediately we were approached by a local gentlemen who offloaded the usual tourist\
  \ spiel of finding a place to stay, taxis, local sights. We had grown accustomed\
  \ to look further before accepting the offer of the first tout that approached us\
  \ but this time intuition kicked in and we chose to go with this gentlemen and he\
  \ kindly took our bags a few quaint colourful streets down to his friends home.\
  \ He explained it was a ladies home that she had converted into a B&B, naturally\
  \ we felt this was a safe option. Weary and feeling the drain of travel we slumped\
  \ our bags to the ground, the house looked clean enough but suspicions were high\
  \ and we were uncertain of our greeting. Suddenly, a wise looking elderly lady in\
  \ a bright woven head scarf dressed head to toe in gypsy like jewels bustled out\
  \ the door and greeted us as if we were her own daughters! She kissed our cheeks\
  \ and exclaimed many joyous greetings in Bosnian. We weren\u2019t so tired anymore\
  \ and became swept away in the emotion and delight of the introduction. She proceeded\
  \ to usher us inside warmly with full heart and spoke to us all the while In her\
  \ mother tounge. The tone of her voice brought happiness to our hearts and we felt\
  \ very grateful for this women\u2019s presence. She gave us time to relax and unpack\
  \ and brought us bountiful luscious bowls of fruit and traditional snacks to help\
  \ us unwind. The house was so authentic, cosy and sweet, it felt like a real home\
  \ from home. Energised by the meeting we joined the elderly lady whom we discovered\
  \ was called Mama Layo, on the balcony to soak in the awe inspiring red rock mountain\
  \ face that towered mightly above and around us. A shaman and his deep rooted magical\
  \ ways wouldn\u2019t of looked a miss trailing along the landscape, eagles soaring\
  \ high with ancestry swirling around their presence. Mama Layo looked at us with\
  \ a pure glint of both motherhood and mischief in her eye, we both got the sense\
  \ of a women who has lived a rich meaningful and sometimes unexpected life. She\
  \ took our hands and spoke fastly in native Bosnian. Somehow and someway we began\
  \ to actually work out and follow a lot of what Mama Layo was conveying to us, it\
  \ was the most miraculous of feelings that swept over us as we gazed into the face\
  \ of this wise beautiful women.  It was as if the usual barrier and disconnection\
  \ of language had been lifted and the language of the heart blossomed and bloomed\
  \ and became the currency of relaying emotions and experiences. Moved by this new\
  \ feeling we felt a new plane of understanding had opened up within our hearts,\
  \ one that existed on a more spiritual plane.  We learnt much of her family, her\
  \ life in this house that she had lived in her whole life, the wars that she had\
  \ lived through and what that meant to her then and now. It was truly enriching\
  \ and by far one of the most meaningful experiences we had the luck of stumbling\
  \ across on our travels around Europe. Her face and words will always resonate in\
  \ my mind and the feelings of love and kindness and connection that were exchanged\
  \ will forever encompass my heart. This experience taught me of how we are truly\
  \ all connected despite distance or cultural differences and one day I would like\
  \ to return to the culturally rich raw landscape that is Bosnia."
