Text: "I had never been so devastated to see a rainbow.\n\n\tIt had been weeks of\
  \ research, supplies for roadside emergencies, satellite phone rental, and three\
  \ nights of crying myself to sleep with fear.  My goal was to drive the Dempster\
  \ Highway, a 900km gravel road in the remote Canadian Arctic.  It begins near Dawson\
  \ City, Yukon Territory, and ends at Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, a once-isolated\
  \ coastal village and beneficiary of the highway\u2019s new extension, completed\
  \ just eighth months earlier.  The Dempster Highway is the only land route to the\
  \ Arctic Ocean.\n\n\tThe offending rainbow was seen in Eagle Plains.  The solitary\
  \ Eagle Plains Hotel and service station exists to be the halfway point between\
  \ Dawson City and Inuvik.  It is invaluable. \n\n\tAt Eagle Plains, you are elevated\
  \ on a plateau and can see far over the empty landscape.  It was very busy (unusually\
  \ so) the evening I arrived, sunny and clear after my white-knuckled rainy morning.\n\
  \tAfter paying for my campsite, I wanted to let my family know I was safe.  \u201C\
  Could I buy some wifi, please?  The sign\u2026\u201D\n\t\u201CDon\u2019t bother,\
  \ the old men are using it and freaking out about the weather.\u201D\n\t\n\tThe\
  \ man at the gas station was more sympathetic.  \u201CAre you heading North?   Make\
  \ sure you leave before noon.  DO NOT leave after the rain starts.\u201D\n\n\tThese\
  \ interactions summarized most of my anxiety about undertaking this journey alone.\
  \  The gravel road is rough and changing, flat tires are very common, and the highway\
  \ is built up high from the tundra so that sliding off the road is high-consequence.\
  \  Not to mention, you are far from roadside assistance.  I like to manage risk\
  \ carefully, so judging whether an unfamiliar, remote road would be safe for me\
  \ in rainy weather filled me with fear.  I loved the gas station worker for his\
  \ clarity.  \n\n\tEagle Plains is about 35km from the Arctic Circle, so I brought\
  \ an eye mask to be able to sleep in my car under the midnight sun.  I peeked out\
  \ from under the mask at 5am, and could see a dark cloud gathering on the western\
  \ horizon.  \u201CI should leave now, before the rain gets here.\u201D  \n\nI fell\
  \ back asleep.\n\n\tWhen my alarm woke me two hours later, I was horrified to find\
  \ the dark clouds nearly upon us.  The rain would start earlier than expected, and\
  \ the \u201Cdifficult driving\u201D that was waiting for me north of Eagle Plains\
  \ loomed ominously in my mind.   I paced around the campsite, tensely listening\
  \ to other drivers discussing the conditions.  \n\t\u201CHow is the road north?\u201D\
  \n\t\u201CPretty muddy, just go slow, watch out for ruts.\u201D\n\t\u201CAnd what\
  \ about fresh rain?\u201D\n\t\u201COh, it\u2019s slippery as heck!\u201D\n\n\tThen\
  \ the sinister rainbow appeared.  Rain had already started, probably only a few\
  \ kilometers away.  I was filled with despair.  I was too slow; too late.  If I\
  \ had started at 5:00, I could have outrun the rain and the danger.\n\t\n      \
  \  As I made up my mind to stay put and play it safe, I heard something about landslides.\
  \   I looked south for the first time that day, and saw that a roadblock was up.\
  \  I later learned that two landslides had washed out the highway south, literally\
  \ closing my way home.  \n\n        Within 10 minutes I was in my car, heading north.\
  \   \n\n        The conditions were bad for a long stretch \u2013 deep mud, and\
  \ very low visibility.  Things improved at the border to the Northwest Territories,\
  \ and I enjoyed the breaks offered by river crossings on ferries.  I stood and breathed\
  \ deeply on the shores of the mighty Mackenzie River, admiring the Gwich'in village\
  \ Tsiigehtchic with its name laid out like the \u201CHollywood\u201D sign on the\
  \ riverbank.  When I arrived in Tuktoyaktuk, I was more proud of myself than I had\
  \ ever been. \n\n      My day in Tuk was magic.  I drifted back to memories of my\
  \ first teaching placement in the fly-in town of Tulita, NWT; the local Inuit walking\
  \ slowly down the dirt roads (though Tulita was more Dene), the houses built on\
  \ concrete pilings over permafrost\u2026only this place smelt like the sea.  I waded\
  \ into the Arctic Ocean filled with love and happy that I hadn\u2019t let fear hold\
  \ me back."
