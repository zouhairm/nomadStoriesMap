Text: "I was an 11 years old girl, out in the great wilderness of the Bay of Fundy\
  \ National Park with only my mother and younger brother to accompany me. We were\
  \ coming back from our arduous grocery shopping, the car bumping slightly on the\
  \ dirt road in the middle of the woods. The dark seemed to be looking at us, although,\
  \ in recollection, it might have only been my youthful imagination. \nMy mother\
  \ pulled up at our camping lot, our little haven in this wild nature. The sky was\
  \ darkened by clouds, so our only source of light was coming from the car. The white\
  \ and red tent stood in the small clearing like a bloody obese ghost. I opened my\
  \ door and stepped out of the car, a plastic grocery bag in each hand, ready to\
  \ face whatever hardships nature might throw at me. The gray pebbles rolled under\
  \ my feet as I walked up to our cloth house. Although the car\u2019s headlights\
  \ could barely pierce the darkness of the forest surrounding us, I was not scared.\
  \ No, I was not scared. Not at all. These strange sounds could not scare me, for\
  \ I was a grown girl.\nI arrived at the door of the tent. The zip was slightly open\
  \ in the bottom, but I paid it little attention. Maybe my brother did not fully\
  \ close it out of laziness. I opened the door, the sound of the zip ripping through\
  \ the almost silent night like thunder. I stepped into the tent.\nAt first, I did\
  \ not see it. I proceeded to put away the groceries in some near corner. Suddenly,\
  \ in the corner of my eye, something moved. Some ominous dark shadow moved in the\
  \ darkness and I, a powerless 11 years old girl, jumped back in a scream.\n-\tA\
  \ racoon! Mom! There\u2019s a racoon in the tent! I shouted at my mother, who was\
  \ still going through our things in the car.\n-\tWhat racoon? Stop exaggerating\
  \ and take care of the groceries, she answered without even looking my way.\nThe\
  \ creature was on the farther side of the tent, looking at me with its yellow eyes,\
  \ gleaming with all the wild instincts such an animal possesses. The half-eaten\
  \ bag of bread, only remnant of whatever food we had before leaving to the grocery\
  \ store, was lying on the ground, its bowels torn open and pieces of bread, wet\
  \ with saliva, pouring out of its plastic skin. I was frozen. I could not do anything.\
  \ I could only look at the creature who could probably jump on me at any time. I\
  \ could only look at its wide glowing eyes, and it looked back at me. \n-\tMom!\
  \ Hurry! I shouted in a panicked voice.\n-\tYeah, yeah, coming, she said lazily.\n\
  The racoon slowly put its paw forward, still looking straight at me. I took a step\
  \ back. It took a step forward. Our eyes were locked onto each other, and we were\
  \ slowly moving in unison, as it headed towards the entrance of the tent and I moved\
  \ back. Now I could see it better, as it was closer to the light. It was the biggest\
  \ racoon I had ever seen. It was humongous, as big as a dog. Its belly was round\
  \ and fat and seemed oddly funny compared to its short chubby legs. This racoon\
  \ was probably well nourished by unknowing tourists such as us. \nIt steadily continued\
  \ moving its fat body towards the door. Once it was close enough for its taste,\
  \ it lunged forward and ran to the forest in a surprisingly swift fashion for such\
  \ a fat body. I was safe now, safe from the wild animal that could have bit me and\
  \ given me who knows what, or worse! \nMy mom finally arrived, accompanied by my\
  \ brother. Both seemed rather amused by my state of shock. \n-Well, seems there\
  \ was indeed a racoon. Let\u2019s put the zipper on top next time to prevent them\
  \ from breaking in, said my mom, amused.\nThis short but stressful encounter left\
  \ quite an impression on my 11 years old self, and I would tell this story for many\
  \ years to come."
