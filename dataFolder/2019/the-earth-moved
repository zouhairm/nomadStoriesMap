Text: "When The Earth Moves\u2026\nThe earthquake woke me.  The rock and gentle roll\
  \ of the floor.  Feeling that \u201CThis is a dream right?\u201D.  Without a conscious\
  \ thought I rolled out of bed without thinking.  The darkness of my Airbnb studio\
  \ apartment lightened by the first rays of dawn shining through my uncurtained window.\
  \   Slipping my feet into my shoes by the door, taking my bag by the handle and\
  \ unlocking the key in the locked door.  I headed out into the hallway.   \nCuenca,\
  \ Equador is a place of beauty and the occasional earthquake.  This one was to be\
  \ a 6.2.  Enough to remind us all of the massive forces of nature.  Enough to cause\
  \ the people to pour out of the mostly 3rd, 4th and 5th floors of the downtown high\
  \ rise apartments.  Many buildings, with walls over 18 inches thick, swaying as\
  \ their foundations were pulled and pushed from beneath.  \nEntire families poured\
  \ into the squares.  Hovered over by the women in their brightly woven wool shawls\
  \ as their only defense against the chill.  Many barefooted and carrying a still\
  \ sleeping child.  Within minutes I was surrounded by women who barely reached my\
  \ shoulderassuring me it would be \u2018bueno\u2019 and patting me.  Rosaries were\
  \ out and prayers whispered. Faith is universal here.\nBottles of water were handed\
  \ about to many hands followed with many thanks.  It was impossible to refuse, a\
  \ modest swallow was expected.\nI was a \u2018tourista\u2019, a lone woman, and\
  \ they were determined to care for me.  I explained I was medically trained for\
  \ emergencies and actually capable to help them.  My bag was filled with the necessities\
  \ of my oh-so-American life, cell phone and charger as well as antiseptics and bandages.\
  \  I began to help with the small scrapes, cuts and wrapped the sprains.  \nIn this\
  \ football stadium sized square there were few injuries and those thankfully minor.\
  \   I was grateful they instantly trusted me with their bodies and their children.\
  \  Humbled by the faith of these people that all would be well.  Equally amazed\
  \ at the nearly immediate rebuilding, regrouping and sorting of fallen stones into\
  \ piles, creating safe pathways. \nBefore the sun would completely rise the flower\
  \ vendors arrived to set up as usual.  Hauling their 5 gallon blue buckets of glorious\
  \ yellow and red blooms as if it were any other ordinary day.  \nThis is a resilient\
  \ people.  I finished with the bandages, antiseptics and handing out of aspirins.\
  \  All were accepted with huge smiles.  Even from the small\nchild whose cut foot\
  \ had made tear trails on his dusty face.  For the dust was settling over all of\
  \ us.  The buildings had been shaken and the pink veil of dust was drifting down\
  \ incredibly slowly down from the buildings.  \nI was gifted with 8 different warm\
  \ bread rolls from thankful patients.  The bakery boy wisely selling his full basket\
  \ in record time and rushing back for a refill.  Every one was hungry and happy\
  \ to have bread so fragrant and fresh.   It was unexpected the wonderful taste of\
  \ the bread, the sharing of\nwater, and the dusty smile of a child.\nI was a stranger,\
  \ trusted, fed, blessed and reassured.  How can you not love the Ecuadorians?  \n\
  After the earthquake 2 small aftershocks seemed to be barely noticed. \nToday Cuenca\
  \ stands as she has since the 1500\u2019s.  Stolid and blessed by 41 active Catholic\
  \ churches.  Each church built with a large square for commerce, flirting, visiting\
  \ and relaxation with a center fountain as often as not.  Buildings surrounding\
  \ each square built on broad foundations, with walls that sway and do not collapse.\
  \  Beautifully built in the tradition of Colonial Spain which once ruled both old\
  \ and new worlds.  The building methods dating back to the great builders of the\
  \ Ottoman Empire endure.  Continents away the legacy their legacy lives on.  \n\
  Ah but the people are purely Ecuadorian and the experience is worth the rock and\
  \ roll of an occasional unexpected earthquake!  I didn't expect this to happen.\
  \  Life is filled with the wonderfully unexpected when you travel.\n\nNormaJean\
  \ Basile"
