Text: Many people seek for new experiences in order to find the escape of everyday
  routine, or the glimpse to their true passion. on January, 2019, my journey begins
  for the advertisement of coffee painting workshop. I had never painted before, but
  I drove all the way to Pakis, Magelang. It was about 45 minutes including my way
  to the small village where the cafe located. As soon as I arrived at the cafe, it
  was all the qontrary to my expectation. They were all men with long hair; yes, as
  scary as I imagined. Smoking with their yellowish teeth, just a few of them appeared
  to be neat. Time goes fast, one of the committee approached me and told me to join
  the coffee painting. He was more excited than I was about inviting people to paint.
  I did not draw anything on the paper because I did not know how. My friend tried
  to have a courage and drew a unique flower with the coffee. Finally, I also tried
  to put the brush through some curves on the paper, but I gave up as soon as I got
  stuck on thinking that this drawing is contradict to the aesthetic. By the time
  I had enough trying on the paper, I had few talks with the committee. That opportunity
  got my mind wandering to a new place. I learned new things about art that sounds
  rational to me. They taught me that there is no such a miscreated art, bad art,
  etc. It only depends on how people see it, that's why art never judges. So will
  I from then on, be falling in love more and more into arts.
