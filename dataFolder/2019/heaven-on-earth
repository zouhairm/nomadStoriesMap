Text: "Last summer, me & my friends headed off Hunza for much needed vacations. We\
  \ go by road It\u2019s a completely different experience when you drive right through\
  \ the mountains along the Karakoram Highway. This region is ridiculously beautiful\
  \ and the pictures really don't do it justice. Just know that if it looks impressive\
  \ in a picture, it's ten times more picturesque in real life.\n\nWe stayed at the\
  \ Hunza Serena Inn, which has beautiful views of the surrounding valley and mountains\
  \ everywhere you look, and a gorgeous view of Baltit Fort in the distance. At night,\
  \ there is none of the noise and pollution of the big city, the clear skies are\
  \ full of stars and music carries over from nearby villages.\nThe beautiful places\
  \ we visted there & you should definitely check out if you\u2019re in Hunza:\nBaltit\
  \ fort:- which is seven hundred years old & is influenced by Tibetan Architecture\
  \ bearing some similarity to the Potala Palace in Lhasa. Over the years, various\
  \ Hunza-Nagar rulers have made additions and changes to the original structure.\
  \ In 1945, the Mir of Hunza abandoned the fort and moved into a new residence closeby.\
  \ More than forty years of neglect left the fort in considerable disrepair and a\
  \ four-year restoration programme, completed in 1996, was supported by the Aga Khan\
  \ Trust for Culture\u2019s Historic Cities Programme.\n\nAltit fort:-Restoration\
  \ of the Altit Fort began in 2004 and was completed six years later. The fort is\
  \ now open to the public and the grounds include the KhaBasi Cafe and the Leif Larsen\
  \ Music Center.  Tickets cost Rs300 and here too you get a guided tour of the fort,\
  \ which is a bit smaller than Baltit but just as fascinating and with equally remarkable\
  \ views all around.\nKhas Basi Cafe:- This charming and unique cafe, run solely\
  \ by women, has a small indoor dining space, but the best spot for a cup of tea\
  \ is the veranda overlooking the adjacent valley. Stop by after touring the Altit\
  \ Fort to sample traditional Hunza cuisine, like the Chap Chrro (flatbread with\
  \ a meat filling), Brustz Shapik (flatbread filled with local cheese, seasoned with\
  \ herbs and apricot oil), and Diram Phitti (a wholesome dessert made with wheat\
  \ and apricot oil).\n\nEagle Nest:- It\u2019s a 40-minute, steep uphill drive to\
  \ the Eagles Nest Hotel from Karimabad. Right next to the hotel is a popular viewpoint,\
  \ frequented mostly at sunrise and sunset. We managed to get there just before sunset\
  \ and the views all around were breathtaking as the light changed and faded.\n\n\
  Attabad Lake:- It was mostly cloudy and rainy during our drive to Hunza, but I\u2019\
  m really glad it was clear and sunny the day we went to Attabad Lake. The water\
  \ is a striking shade of blue, surrounded by mountains, and it's crazy to think\
  \ it didn't even exist until 2010, when a devastating landslide led to its formation.\
  \ I go for boating at Attabad lake.\nThe lake is a 40 minute drive from the Hunza\
  \ Serena Inn. Boats rides are about 50 minutes long and cost Rs2000 per boat.\n\n\
  Glacier Breeze Restaurant:- I hadn't had a satisfactory cup of tea of coffee since\
  \ we left Islamabad. After Attabad Lake, we headed on to Glacier Breeze Restaurant\
  \ (near the Passu village) for their famous apricot cake, and I was beyond excited\
  \ when I saw filter coffee on the menu. When I inquired, I half expected the man\
  \ taking our order to say they didn't have any. When he finally brought out a huge\
  \ French press filled with coffee, I couldn't quite contain my joy.\nYou have to\
  \ climb a lot of steps to get to the restaurant, which is pretty much in the middle\
  \ of nowhere. Once you reach the top though, there\u2019s a great view of the Passu\
  \ Glacier and Cathedral Ridge from here and you\u2019re only about a two-hour drive\
  \ away from Khunjerab Pass.\nIt is not wrong to say for me, that was magical holiday\
  \ for me in Hunza."
