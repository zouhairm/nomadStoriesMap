Text: "Maya kept one eye on the door and the other on the pot while instructing me\
  \ not to chop the cilantro too fine. Her daughter was due from school any minute,\
  \ a hungry and possibly cranky eight year old who would be looking forward to her\
  \ special Friday lunch, a steaming bowl of Pepi\xE1n. This was a routine, a tradition\
  \ really, that had become an integral part of the week for both mother and daughter.\
  \ It had only been three hours since I had bumped into Maya, I trying to navigate\
  \ the very congested vegetable market in my broken and rather loud Spanish, she\
  \ picking up her weekly groceries. But in that moment I might as well have been\
  \ a part of her household, as old as the skillet on which the tomatoes were getting\
  \ roasted black. The kitchen, though not large by any standards, opened up to a\
  \ balcony that directly overlooked the lake. Volc\xE1n Atitl\xE1n and Tolim\xE1\
  n were visible in the distance, providing a dramatic backdrop against the clear\
  \ blue waters. It would have been hard to take my eyes off that picture perfect\
  \ view were it not for Maya, who made sure that the task at hand as well as her\
  \ running commentary were far more interesting. The mountains were there to stay,\
  \ but g\xFCisquil and potatoes wouldn't peel by themselves, would they now? She\
  \ picked one and showed me how to get it done in one clean stroke before shifting\
  \ her attention back to the pot, checking to see if the chicken was done. \n\nI\
  \ wasn't a stranger to her helpful nature anymore, not after that morning when she\
  \ had rescued me from the chile stall. Not only had she patiently answered my questions\
  \ and explained the difference between chiles pasa and guajillo, but had herself\
  \ gone on to give me a quick primer on Guatemalan cuisine. The name Pepi\xE1n came\
  \ up more than once, a national delicacy that I had heard of but hadn't yet tried.\
  \ I had asked for a recommendation then, hoping to find an eatery frequented by\
  \ locals, perhaps even a hidden gem. What I hadn't expected was an invitation into\
  \ her home, one that I gratefully accepted. She walked me through the rest of the\
  \ market, completing her shopping and introducing me to vendors who seemed to have\
  \ reserved their brightest smiles and funniest jokes for her. It had almost felt\
  \ as if I was gatecrashing an intimate meeting between friends. \n\nWe had then\
  \ proceeded towards her home, half a mile away in a part of town I wouldn\u2019\
  t have found in any guidebook or travel blog. She had kept the conversation going\
  \ all this while, asking about my life in Boston and telling me about hers. While\
  \ I had been having a lot of fun observing and learning from Maya, I was glad now\
  \ to see all the roasted veggies and spices getting blended into a smooth puree,\
  \ our hard work over the past hour and a half about to reach its much anticipated\
  \ conclusion. Cooking her recipe could by no means be classified as an easy task\
  \ even with the two of us working together, and I wondered how she went through\
  \ the trouble of preparing that dish by herself every single week. A dish that not\
  \ only required time and effort, but more ingredients than most locals could afford\
  \ to buy on a regular basis. It didn't look as if Maya was particularly well off,\
  \ and I couldn't help but think of it all as an extravagance that I had luckily\
  \ chanced upon. Or perhaps, this is what they call love. The love that made her\
  \ fulfill her daughter's wish every week even if it meant going beyond her means.\
  \ The love towards her rich cultural heritage that she was proudly sharing with\
  \ a stranger and already passing on to the next generation. As Maya poured the Pepi\xE1\
  n in two large bowls, leaving little for her own self, I realized that I had been\
  \ invited to more than just a meal. I was, for a few hours, fortunate enough to\
  \ be included as a small part of her life and all that she loved."
