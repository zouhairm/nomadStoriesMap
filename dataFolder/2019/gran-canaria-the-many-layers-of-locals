Text: "\"Oh, she is going to the camel park,\" I overhear an English woman say as\
  \ I hop off the bus on the side of a narrow mountain road. How this full-sized bus\
  \ manages to climb up these steep windy roads both amazes and freaks me out whenever\
  \ I find myself behind the steering wheel of a rental car; hoping for the best at\
  \ every 360 turn carved into the crumbly volcanic massif.\nI am the only person\
  \ exiting at this random bus stop but riding in a metal contraption, strapped onto\
  \ the back of an imported captive animal, through the desert Fataga ravine to the\
  \ sand dunes of Maspalomas is certainly not the reason I am here. My plan is to\
  \ descend 16 km on my two feet from a tiny sleepy village called Arteara, in the\
  \ footsteps of these impressively resilient creatures, back down to the neon lights\
  \ of the main beach resort - Playa del Ingles. \nIronically the small street I start\
  \ to follow through the traditional stone walled houses turns into a lusciously\
  \ green palm tree oasis with fruit trees and vegetable gardens taking advantage\
  \ of the scarce underground streams of water. The whole safari tour picture is complete.\
  \ Just like being in Africa; only we are not.\n\nWe are in Gran Canaria, a volcanic\
  \ Spanish island, situated 150 km off the coast of Africa and over 1000 km away\
  \ from its official motherland; Europe.\n\nThis time I came to visit a friend of\
  \ mine who married a Canarian. I was ready to soak up the sunshine, learn a bit\
  \ of Spanish and rest after a long winter season working in an Austrian ski resort\
  \ for 50 hours a week. I was considering taking the whole summer off and going backpacking\
  \ again; call it another midlife crisis. Only then I was offered a full-time job\
  \ in a pool bar for 5 months straight. And just like that, I became a local.\nPretending\
  \ to be a local, living and working on a subtropical island, sounds like fun till\
  \ you realize that you might have to spend all you manage to earn on a small studio\
  \ flat and overpriced food. Unless, of course, you are willing to commute 2 hours\
  \ a day from a cheaper area that you can afford to live in as the real locals do.\n\
  \n\u201CWhere do you go on holidays when you live here then?\u201D a drunk British\
  \ man asks me leaning against the bar countertop exhaling cigarette smoke right\
  \ into my face. I really don\u2019t feel like engaging in a pointless small talk\
  \ again just to be a polite barmaid; trying to explain that I fancy myself a traveler\
  \ who just happened to accept this job as I found myself at another crossroad. \n\
  \u201CNowhere,\u201D I cut the conversation short.\n\u201CI thought so,\u201D agrees\
  \ the man.\n\nThe summer is over and so is my contract. No more pouring bottled\
  \ beers into plastic cups only to be allowed to drink around the swimming pool,\
  \ most people never leave during the whole week of their vacation, serving chicken\
  \ nuggets, sugary slush puppies and chit-chatting about the weather and football.\
  \ A mental note to myself: I must do something more meaningful with my life.\n\n\
  Living in a foreign country for a longer period of time is a great way to explore\
  \ it and delve into the culture. Only here it seems to be a little more complex\
  \ than that. What culture are we talking about?\nThe Spanish culture created after\
  \ the Conquest in the 15th century built upon the remnants of the aboriginal, possibly\
  \ Egyptian, people who had peacefully farmed these lands long before that?\nThe\
  \ culture of the different expat groups who settle here each year in search of a\
  \ warm climate and never learn a word of Spanish?\nThe new-age spiritual seekers\
  \ establishing permaculture projects and opening vegan restaurants trying to regenerate\
  \ this beautiful, magical, enchanting, fertile piece of land?\n\nWhat does it mean\
  \ to be a local in a place where even the camels are not. What is the common language\
  \ we all shall speak to connect?"
