Text: "The Maldives are the stuff dreams are made of -- as in dream vacations inspired\
  \ by those impossibly idyllic screen savers, or those pesky fantasies about quitting\
  \ your day job to live on an exotic island for the rest of your life (or at least\
  \ a week or two). You know, the places that can't possibly live up to your expectations\
  \ of beauty and wonder. Well, we found out that the crazy thing about the Maldives\
  \ is, this destination does. This place really looks exactly like those stock images\
  \ floating across your screen: bright sun, transparent blue lagoons, house reefs\
  \ teeming with fish, low waters with baby reef sharks and rays, and white sand beaches\
  \ that stretch out into nothing but miles and miles of turquoise waters and blue\
  \ skies. \n\n I was with my small family, Spouse & 2 kids, ages 3 & 6. We landed\
  \ at the Paradise Island,  25 mints board driving from the  capital, Mal\xE9. Like\
  \ all resorts, the hotel is on its own private island that boasts over water bungalows,\
  \ their own restaurant, bar, spa, and operated tours. (And, like most resorts here,\
  \ meals and drinks are included in the cost of the room.)\nParadise Island is on\
  \ the lower end of the price spectrum, costing $356 USD per night, which, while\
  \ not super budget, is a lot cheaper than other resorts like the Park Hyatt ($940\
  \ USD per night), the Taj ($945 USD per night), Komandoo Maldive Island Resort ($650\
  \ USD per night), the W ($1,288 USD), the Four-Seasons ($1,600 USD), or the St.\
  \ Regis ($2,000 USD a night)\n\nAs we were itching for an overdue vacation and work\
  \ detox, our visit was just what the doctor ordered: a tropical island with limited\
  \ Internet .I spent my days trying not to burn myself on the beach, reading books\
  \ (I highly recommend A Year of Living Danishly by Helen Russell), and drinking\
  \ wine, stuffing my face, retiring for more reading and maybe a movie. Life on the\
  \ island was easy. In the resort bubble, you don\u2019t have to worry about getting\
  \ around, meals, or what to do. It was a fabulous family excursion I should say.\
  \ The staff was super friendly, they knew how to make a good drink, and there was\
  \ always food around. Meals were buffet style (unless you paid extra for the romantic\
  \ crab restaurant or the lunchtime cooking class, which we did. \n\nTaking advantage\
  \ of some of the hotel\u2019s tours, we went dolphin watching (so many dolphins!),\
  \ snorkeled each day, and visited a couple of the nearby islands.\n\nBut, after\
  \ four days, we were both a bit ready to move on. We can only take vacation life\
  \ for a few days before I get bored. The high life was what I thought it would be\
  \ \u2014 relaxing opulence \u2014 but we were itching to see the real Maldives,\
  \ life on the local islands, and talk to a few people!\n\nAfter returning to Mal\xE9\
  \ we hopped into a speedboat and headed to Maafushi, ground zero for the Maldives\u2019\
  \ burgeoning independent travel industry, to start our island-hopping adventure.\
  \ We spent 2 nights over there.\nIt was a horrible place and I hope to never return.\n\
  Maafushi, once a sleepy little island, is now the victim of uncontrolled development.\
  \ There are hotels going up left and right, boats making frequent trips to Mal\xE9\
  \ to pick up tour groups, and one small, increasingly crowded, overbuilt beach.\
  \ The few restaurants on the island cater mostly to tourists, and outside the area\
  \ cleaned up for visitors, it\u2019s one trash-covered dump. \nWhen you are visiting\
  \ the Maldives, research the ferries beforehand so you know when and where you can\
  \ go next. Island hopping is very difficult without planning. I messed up by not\
  \ looking at the ferry system before I arrived; as a result, I missed a few islands\
  \ I wanted to visit. I wrongly assumed there would be frequent ferries between the\
  \ islands \u2014 I was sorely mistaken\n\nAnd don\u2019t worry \u2013 the Maldives\
  \ is very safe. No one is going to steal all that cash. I never once felt uneasy\
  \ about having lots of money on me.\nI was sad to leave and wish I had more time\
  \ to explore the nooks and crannies of the atolls. Yes, it was one hell of vacation\
