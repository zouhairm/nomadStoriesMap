Text: "The first time I went to London was autumn 2010. I went there with my father,\
  \ stepmother, bigbrother and bigsister. We were there about four days. I fell in\
  \ love with the city. There were everything you could imagine from city vacation;\
  \ shopping, delicious food, experiences\u2026 List goes on and on\u2026 First thing\
  \ what we did at London was finding our hotel. It was located near by the British\
  \ Museum. After laying down at the hotel\u2019s king size bed, we went to explore\
  \ the city. That was the first time I got to see how multicultured place London\
  \ really was, like a meltingpot. There was a very good chance for me to really get\
  \ to know London\u2019s food culture. It was amazing! There was chinese, indian\
  \ food, arabian food and european food, almost everything you can imagine. I got\
  \ crazy about sushi. It was totally insane! We ate sushi almost every day, at least\
  \ once a day. It was so delicious!\n\nWhat I also want to write about London, is\
  \ the shops and street fashion. There were so many shops where I wanted to stop\
  \ by. But that wasn\u2019t an option because there were too many of them, and the\
  \ clock was ticking. When we went to the Oxford Street there was many tourists also,\
  \ intention to shop. The people at London were super stylish. There were so many\
  \ different styles. That kind of dressing up I haven\u2019t seen in Finland. Every\
  \ pedestrian was personal and different.\n\nThe second time I went to London, was\
  \ a year later, 2011. We had to go there again, because last four days were too\
  \ short. At that time I went there with my father and sister and stepmother. My\
  \ brother couldn\u2019t come because of school. This time was a little bit different.\
  \ We didn\u2019t go to the museums. We ate, shopped and went to the O2 Arena, were\
  \ was Titanic exhibition. It was so interesting and intriguing. Titanic has always\
  \ been interesting thing for me. It was a shame, that there wasn\u2019t allowed\
  \ to photograph. But that experience always stays in my mind. In O2 Arena was also\
  \ different kinds of exhibitions, such as Harry Potter animal-exhibition. There\
  \ was Hermione\u2019s real cat and Hagrid\u2019s dog from the movies. There were\
  \ also Harry Potter\u2019s owl. They were so cute! We were amazed when we saw Back\
  \ to the Future car, DeLorean DMC-12, which was so cool."
