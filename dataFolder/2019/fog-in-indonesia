Text: "Our first morning in Indonesia was a fog. The jet lag made my senses hazy:\
  \ foreign conversations processed slowly, unfamiliar smells lingered, new sights\
  \ overwhelmed me. As we ventured into Jakarta, a fog had settled over the buildings,\
  \ struck yellow by the low-rising sun. Deftly swerving around trapped cars, motorcycles\
  \ blurred past us.\n\nIndonesia was the first leg of our trip through Southeast\
  \ Asia. We were a group of college friends: Emma, Sam, Taylor, and me. Sam was originally\
  \ from Jakarta but moved to Cleveland when he was five. This was his first time\
  \ back, a homecoming of sorts, and his aunt and uncle graciously hosted us.\n\n\
  That morning we had piled into a small car with Sam\u2019s aunt and uncle. Emma,\
  \ Taylor, and I had no knowledge of the plans and sat complacently in the web of\
  \ Indonesian. Some English would get garbled in, and we latched onto those words,\
  \ often hearing \u201Cmotorcycles\u201D and \u201Ccaves.\u201D Sam shared that we\
  \ were headed to Bandung to escape the city\u2019s gridlock. I had never heard of\
  \ the region and I mostly focused on pronouncing it correctly. (Sam would cringe\
  \ as we stumbled over pronouncing terima kasih, Jakarta, and Bandung.)\n\nTaylor\
  \ mentioned that she had heard of Bandung but couldn\u2019t remember why. It would\
  \ be months later that I would read a novel on Turkey\u2019s modern history and\
  \ learn about the historical importance of Bandung. I would learn about the Non-Aligned\
  \ Movement and this country and others\u2019 hope to not become a pawn of the superpowers.\
  \ I would learn about the American and Soviet insistence on sides. For now I only\
  \ watched out the window as we slowly inched out of the second largest city in the\
  \ world.\n\nThe closer we got into Bandung, the more I heard \u201Cmotorcycle.\u201D\
  \ We had almost reached the top of a mountain when the uncle pulled over. Men casually\
  \ lined a fence, some smoking cigarettes, some sitting on motorcycles. The uncle\
  \ got out and began haggling prices, motioning us when it was settled. My motorcyclist\
  \ barely waited for me before taking off. \n\nThe ride up revealed the lush landscape\
  \ of Bandung. Rice fields lined the hills, huts shouldered them, and dirt roads\
  \ connected them. In the air water hung heavy, ready to burst, and sometimes it\
  \ would \u2013 misting us as we zigzagged up the mountain. Although the top offered\
  \ a more scenic view, it was the motorcycle ride that captured the beauty and movement\
  \ of the country.\n\nWe went down to visit the caves. I imagined natural ones, perhaps\
  \ etched from waterfalls. A tour guide led us in as the sun set orange and yellow.\
  \ The caves were man-made. Dozens of tunnels created a labyrinth of rooms and halls\
  \ under the mountain. The caves were damp, and it felt like their creators were\
  \ still there, hanging in the air. I asked Sam why the caves existed. He told me,\
  \ \u201CWorld War II to hide from the Japanese.\u201D I felt a wave of embarrassment\
  \ at my own ignorance; I hadn\u2019t even known that Indonesia was involved in the\
  \ war.\n\nAfter the caves, we began walking to the car to leave for Jakarta. The\
  \ darkness had started to snake in, and it was eerie to consider the jungle\u2019\
  s vastness. As the color drained out of the sky, a prayer echoed over the mountains,\
  \ blanketing the mountains with its warmth. It was \"Salat Al-Maghrib\", and I remembered\
  \ that Indonesia was almost ninety percent Muslim. The comfort of this prayer was\
  \ not only across these mountains, but also across the country, greeting the darkness.\
  \ When we had reached Jakarta, the fog had been lifted and unveiled a vast city\
  \ twinkling with lights.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find the United States in Indonesia\
  \ that day. I na\xEFvely believed that traveling to a foreign country meant learning\
  \ about them. However, due to the omnipresent imperialism of the United States,\
  \ history is much more often about us. How have our stories become interwoven? Though\
  \ the loom of our connection often begins in a broken way, it can be rewoven. Much\
  \ like the fog of the morning, our own ignorance can be lifted, offering clarity\
  \ in our historic complicity and hope in our future companionship."
