Text: "I am currently a student of English Literature and French and for my residence\
  \ abroad requirement, my mother and I have decided to check \u201Cwalk 600km in\
  \ the French August heat\u201D off of our bucket lists. We begin on the 25th of\
  \ July, which also happens to be my 23rd birthday, from the center of Paris. Staying\
  \ in small French villages of various sizes and populations, we walk an average\
  \ of 25k everyday for 4 weeks. Between my mother and I there is 30 years so you\
  \ could say we are attempting to treat our quarter and mid life crises. As I approach\
  \ the end of my time in university and she approaches the 20 year mark in her job,\
  \ we decided we were both in need of some perspective. We\u2019ve always been extremely\
  \ close so this won\u2019t be a \u201CI have to spend a month with my mother, pray\
  \ for me\u201D type of story but rather a story of two women at different points\
  \ in their lives attempting to learn something from one another. A killer tan and\
  \ toned legs will indeed be a fringe benefit to walking from Paris to Bordeaux in\
  \ 4 weeks but I know that we both expect to gain a little bit more from this undertaking.\
  \ As we start to prepare for the journey, buying walking shoes and accumulating\
  \ sachets of moisturizer which will hopefully be easier to transport than tubs of\
  \ cosmetics, we share theories on what will be the hardest part, if tiny French\
  \ towns will accomodate her gluten free diet and if our tans will indeed be killer,\
  \ there is definitely an unspoken nervousness of \u201Ccan we do this?\u201D. We\
  \ deal with experiences differently, but I for one will be seeking catharsis on\
  \ this experience through writing, my usual therapeutic process. I look forward\
  \ to writing this story, as I currently have no clue what\u2019s in store on our\
  \ 600k walk through obscure French countryside."
