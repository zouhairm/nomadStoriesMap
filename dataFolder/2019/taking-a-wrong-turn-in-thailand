Text: "It\u2019s Day 3 of my 600-km tour of the Mae Hong Son region of Northern Thailand,\
  \ and the road I\u2019m traveling begins to deteriorate into a condition no moped\
  \ should ever travel.\L The journey brought me through beautiful winding mountain\
  \ roads, curving between forested hills and dipping into valleys. I was en route\
  \ to the village of Ban Mae on the Thai-Myanmar border. It was a dream.\L \nUntil\
  \ I neared the final kilometers that is.\L\nSomehow, I missed the turn off to the\
  \ village.\L\nAnd, somehow, as the road further deteriorated into the cavernous\
  \ dirt track I was now descending onto, I still continued on.\L\L\n\nMy rational\
  \ mind began to jostle for a more meaningful role in the drama at this point.\n\
  Turn around, this is madness.\L\nMinutes later, it is back \u2013 but in an even\
  \ more desperate state.\nDear God, turn around \u2013 that\u2019s a sheer drop.\L\
  \L\n\nFinally, just as I was about to turn around and give up, I saw a small hut\
  \ in the distance. It is amazing the effect the sight of human habitation can have\
  \ on the mind. I was renewed with energy and determination. The track leveled out\
  \ and, as I brought the moped to a slower speed, I found myself drifting into a\
  \ remote hill tribe village.\n\n\L\LI like to think that some of the villagers gazed\
  \ up at the track at this time and found themselves confronted by the sight of a\
  \ 6\u20192\u201D Caucasian man on a rented moped, covered in dust, visibly shaken\
  \ and descending into their village. If they were shocked, it was probably less\
  \ so than I. That sense of being very much off the beaten track, of possibly being\
  \ somewhere I should not be, was heavy and palpable in me. Like an elephant in a\
  \ fleet of swallows, I was feeling a tad out of place.\n\n\L\LI was aware that this\
  \ region of Thailand is known for its many hill tribe villages. They are scattered\
  \ throughout the most remote areas of Mae Hong Son, many still holding on to their\
  \ traditional ways and forging their own identity in an ever-modernising country.\
  \ I was always of the opinion that they should be left alone.\LYet, here I was.\
  \ There was no choice but to continue on into the heart of the village.\L\n\nI followed\
  \ a narrow path between huts held up on high stilts. My awareness was drawn immediately\
  \ to the most incredibly aromatic scent. Somewhere within the village, a herb was\
  \ burning and its smoke was drifting lazily in the air? The effect on me felt mystical.\
  \ It took me by the hand and brought me slowly inside the rhythm of the village.\
  \ I found myself longing to find its source and its name. It gave me the confidence\
  \ to continue on.\L\n\nHello! Water?\L\nA young villager was by my side. He was\
  \ intrigued to see me. A wide smile graced his face as he beckoned me to follow.\n\
  Come, come!\nHe stayed by my side, his smile and warm nature settling me and making\
  \ me feel welcome. He directed me towards a place to sit, and I was offered water.\n\
  \n\L\LBeing midday and with the sun high in the sky, the villagers were gathered\
  \ at various places in the shade. An old man squatted whilst working with a bamboo\
  \ stalk, his body shape demonstrating the epitome of good posture. From across a\
  \ small stream, a line of children giggled and played as they made their way to\
  \ a small wooden bridge. Soon, they were dispersing and gathering around the new\
  \ arrival. My sudden arrival being a great source of mirth to them all. As I sat\
  \ there in the shade, a young woman passed by holding a burning bundle of dried\
  \ herbs. So there it was, the scent I longed to find, the source of the magical\
  \ aroma. At that moment I found myself longing to stay with these people. \n\n\L\
  Yet, I knew not to stay long. Before sunset, I returned to Mae Sariang, to my hotel\
  \ and, now, to this bar, where I drank deep on the memory of my encounter and felt\
  \ my thirst for further adventure grow."
