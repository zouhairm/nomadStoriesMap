Text: "Berlin is one of those cities that is not just a city it's an experience and\
  \ exploring its secrets was exhausting. \nIts historical dualities and role as a\
  \ catalyst fascinate me:  the centre of liberal and intellectual thought vs. the\
  \ centre of nazi imperialism, hardline communism vs. rampant capitalism.  Symbols\
  \ of the folly of man abound: of politics, of war (hot and cold), of resistance,\
  \ triumph and defeat.  I found it inspiring.\n\nThe last time I was in Germany was\
  \ 1984. The cold war was heating up, U.S. President Ronald Reagan joked over a hot\
  \ (radio) mic ,\u201Cwe start bombing in 5 minutes\u201D.  Europe went on red alert\
  \ and I watched things unfold from the centre of it all, a \u2018peace camp\u2019\
  \ down the road from an American missile base where short range nuclear missiles\
  \ (Pershings) were deployed.\n\nIn those days the iron curtain was still up and\
  \ the only way into Berlin overland was by train through East Germany.  I never\
  \ did it, much to my regret,  but after all these years I finally had my date with\
  \ Berlin and it was extraordinary.\n\nThe most fascinating district is Mitte, in\
  \ the former East.  I learned this when the airport bus stopped short of its run\
  \ and sent me onto the streets without a map.  I prefer to discover what a city\
  \ has to offer rather than guidebook my way through it, so when i got off the bus\
  \ I knew two things - which way to go and the hostel wasn\u2019t far.  (Tip: far\
  \ is relative).   After 1km of navigating my small suitcase along the semi- cobblestoned\
  \ streets I stopped to rest in a park. \n\nI sat down, looked around and lo and\
  \ behold was a larger than life brass statue of Friedrich Engels standing beside\
  \ his muse, a seated Karl Marx. Definitely old East Berlin.  They were surrounded\
  \ by a series of roughly hewn stone reliefs and brass cast depictions of humanities\
  \ war agonies, western aggression, and a faded metal photo display of American street\
  \ protests against Vietnam.  \n\nWalking through the park I found the original city\
  \ centre, dateline 1700\u2019s.  It was charming, with winding streets and a centuries\
  \ old church, stone buildings, an outdoor cafe serving hot chocolate and showing\
  \ old black and white movies, and a 300 year old re-built pub,  I got the flavour\
  \ of both pre-war and East Berlin and through old art and photos got an idea of\
  \ its bawdy nature back in the day. We are puritans in comparison !\n\nThe next\
  \ day I joined a walking tour. Most cities have them and they are hands down the\
  \ best way to learn a city\u2019s secrets and stories.  We met at Brandenburg Gate(Tor),\
  \ the 18th Century romanesque monumental entrance to Berlin.  A symbol of a divided\
  \ Germany, it was in \u2018no man\u2019s land\u2019 from 1961, when the wall went\
  \ up, to 1989 when it fell.  \n\nWe walked to the Holocaust memorial, half a hectare\
  \ of granite coffin-like stone slabs that absorbed all sound and rose from the ground\
  \ in waves.  The memorial to the Roma is in Tiertgarten Park between Brandenburg\
  \ Gate and the Reichstag. Both memorials are deeply moving.\n\nPassing Hitler\u2019\
  s bunker, now under a car park, we headed for the former headquarter of the Luftwaffe,\
  \ now the tax office. It survived the war standing because allied bomber pilots\
  \ used the huge building (4000 windows, 2,800 rooms and 7km of corridors) as a landmark.\
  \ \n\nNext door had been Gestapo headquarters and the SS building, and though they\
  \ were flattened, remnant (underground) cells of the former remain with a length\
  \ of wall crossing overtop in a stunning display of two eras of conflict.   Where\
  \ the SS building stood is now a museum called \u2018Topography of Terror\u2019\
  , the name says it all.  My head was spinning with the meaning and symbology of\
  \ it all.\n\nI loved Berlin. Uncovering its treasures and trove of museums and galleries\
  \ was invigorating, The transportation system is excellent, prices are reasonable,\
  \ there are some really good restaurants, the nightlife rocks and I even got my\
  \ film festival fix when I stumbled onto the Berlin Short Film Festival happening\
  \ down the road from my hostel.   Auf weidersehen Berlin, till we meet again."
