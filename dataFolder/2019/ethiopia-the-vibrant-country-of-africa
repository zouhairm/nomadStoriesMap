Text: "\u201CYou are going to Africa?\u201D my cousin asked me in astonishment as\
  \ I was getting ready to make first ever trip to the Continent. I replied, \u201C\
  Ethiopia, not whole Africa, the continent has 54 countries.\u201D \nI had my apprehensions\
  \ of making this business trip as I had heard many ignorant and half-baked advice\
  \ from uncles and aunts who cannot point any other country apart from the West,\
  \ about Africa such as, \u201CDon\u2019t go out of your house after dark, those\
  \ people will rob you\u201D and \u201CWhat will you eat there? They eat raw meat\u201D\
  . \nMy apprehensions turned to dust as I got out of the airplane at Bole International\
  \ Airport at Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. I was greeted with pleasant weather\
  \ and friendly people who were ready to help me for my smallest trouble. The Federal\
  \ Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, a country based in the Horn of Africa is one\
  \ of Africa\u2019s most populous countries. Addis Ababa the capital was my primary\
  \ destination which reminded me of Mumbai city 20 -25 years ago. The city based\
  \ on a hilly terrain has a cool pleasant weather most of the year with low levels\
  \ of pollution due to fewer cars plying on the road.\nAs a foodie, my first agenda\
  \ on the recreation list for the trip was to taste the local cuisine available and\
  \ I was not disappointed at all. The national dish of Ethiopia is \u2018Injera\u2019\
  , a flat round pancake which looks similar to a Turkish towel when rolled up. Made\
  \ of fermented flour of \u2018teff\u2019, a local variety of grain, it reminded\
  \ me of our very own Indian \u2018Dosa\u2019 but only more sour on taste. It is\
  \ accompanied with servings of different meat and vegetable  gravies called \u2018\
  Waat\u2019 as toppings on it. When eating Injera, with friends or family, it is\
  \ a common custom to feed others in the group with one's hand by putting the rolled\
  \ Injera into another's mouth. This is called a \u2018Gursha\u2019, and the larger\
  \ the Gursha, the stronger the friendship or bond. Injera is more of a community\
  \ dish where 2-3 people share it together to spread the \u2018Gursha\u2019.\nWhen\
  \ we talk about coffee, the story of the goatherd whose goat ate the coffee plant\
  \ and discovered its stimulating effects cannot be missed. Well, this legend of\
  \ discovery of coffee originated in Ethiopia making it the birthplace of the brew\
  \ we enjoy every day. The making and drinking of coffee is a huge and long affair\
  \ and celebrated like a festival where all the family members come together in a\
  \ relaxing atmosphere. The ladies manually roast, then grind the coffee beans and\
  \ make the brew for more than two hours filling the surrounding with its rich aroma.\
  \ \nThere are typically three varieties of coffees available in Ethiopia namely\
  \ Harar, Sidamo and Yigacheffe which can be bought at Addis Mercato, a large open\
  \ air marketplace having over 120 stores and one massive shopping center with 75\
  \ stores.\nAs a French meal rests incomplete without wine, likewise an Ethiopian\
  \ meal cannot be complete without \u2018Tej\u2019 the local honey wine. \u2018Tej\u2019\
  \ is a locally brewed and consumed wine made of honey, flavored with the powdered\
  \ leaves and twigs of gesho, a hops like bittering agent and is available in bars\
  \ called \u2018Tej Betoch\u2019 literally meaning Tej houses. Tej is generally had\
  \ in a laboratory flask kind vessel called \u2018berele\u2019 and its sweetness\
  \ masks the high alcohol content which varies greatly according to the length of\
  \ fermentation. For the teetotalers, there is \u2018Spris\u2019 which is a thick\
  \ multilayered juice made of avocado and mango with strawberry or pineapple.\nEthiopia\
  \ is also known as the cradle of mankind as the remains of the supposedly first\
  \ ever human have been discovered here. Named \u2018Lucy\u2019, the remains are\
  \ showcased in the National Museum of Ethiopia and a sight which should not be missed\
  \ by any amateur archeologist. \nThough Ethiopia is identified as an underdeveloped\
  \ country, it is one of the most vibrant and tourist friendly countries in Africa\
  \ with its relaxed people and multiple offerings as a tourist destination."
