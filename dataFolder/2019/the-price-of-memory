Text: "This was the one trip I had never wanted to take.\n\nReturning from a family\
  \ visit in Seattle, I willed the plane to take me on, over the Atlantic and back\
  \ to the life I had built for myself teaching  in Budapest. But instead it curved\
  \ south, towards the complicated memories of Huntsville, Alabama. \n\nNo passport\
  \ was necessary, although it may as well have been a different country. I\u2019\
  d put a lot of miles between myself and the South, but in no time at all I was sliding\
  \ back into the \u201Cyes ma\u2019am\u2019s\u201D and \u201Cno sirs\u201D, the deep\
  \ fried everything\u2019s, the lush humidity that settles into your lungs, the hair-raising\
  \ electricity of thunderstorms rumbling nearer.\n\nI\u2019m folded into my grandparents\u2019\
  \ arms and drawn into the collage of house slippers, last year\u2019s turnip greens\
  \ thawing on the kitchen counter, the portrait of Jesus keeping watch over the front\
  \ door, the piano with its chipped ivory keys. -He played this piano uncountable\
  \ times.- Moving overseas hadn\u2019t stopped the news articles in my feed\u2014\
  all those black boys killed. For the first time I wondered at the layers of weight\
  \ my grandparents carried on their brown shoulders, day in and day out. But in this\
  \ house, everything was peaceful. Nothing had changed\u2014except the crowded wall\
  \ of pictures, members of a growing family. --They look so much like him.-- I ache\
  \ to know them. I shove down the guilt of staying so distant.\n\nTry as I might,\
  \ my stiffness softens each day\u2014there\u2019s a seduction inherent in the South,\
  \ wrapped up in the molasses accents and sweet, heavy air. It had only been a few\
  \ years since I\u2019d been here, but it felt like another lifetime. Another girl\
  \ who had chased after lightning bugs and felt a connection to every white Baptist\
  \ spire on the landscape.\n\nWe walk out of one of those churches now\u2014he played\
  \ piano here\u2014and into the mercifully cooling evening. But still, a layer of\
  \ sweat lays on my skin, the tax for stepping outside in the Southern summer. The\
  \ cicada symphony has started and something inside of me sings back.\n\nAnd finally,\
  \ next to the church, the true root of my reluctance: My father\u2019s grave. So\
  \ many years spent running and now I was stuck there facing it, my impractical heels\
  \ sinking into the moist red dirt. \n\nAbove, the sky glows with pink and gold brush\
  \ strokes of the sunset as I try to understand. But who can understand? How the\
  \ same sky that looks so gorgeous can also turn black. Can bring down a tornado\
  \ that rips through homes while the family is still inside, spares the children\
  \ but kills their father?\nI look over at my invaluable grandmother, making her\
  \ way down the manicured field, saying her hellos, pausing at a headstone here and\
  \ there. She\u2019s purposeful, strong. Pain and resilience hand in hand. Tornadoes\
  \ may fall out of the sky and tear life apart, but the people here keep rebuilding,\
  \ keep remembering. They don\u2019t fear the thunder. \n\n\u201CReady to go?\u201D\
  . Grandma and grandpa have made their way back to the car. We all stand together,\
  \ shoulder to shoulder\u2014that gentle pressure pushing out the last of my resistance.\
  \  I collapse into my family. --Our family.-- Red-rimmed eyes and red brick churches\
  \ and red dirt on my shoes. I\u2019m grounded again.\n\n\u201CYes\u201D. \n\nTomorrow,\
  \ my passport will take me back to Hungary, back to a different country. I will\
  \ be different too."
