Text: "Two years ago, my friend Jacqueline and I decided to take a five-day trip to\
  \ Paris. We had both been before, so this time it would be less touristy; \u201C\
  we would fit in with the locals\u201D we convinced ourselves. Surely, it would be\
  \ glamorous and nonchalant because we were only going for five days. \nUnfortunately,\
  \ I\u2019m not nonchalant. I\u2019m riddled with anxiety, neurosis, and a suitcase\
  \ of food for my very sensitive digestive system. Jacqueline however is more free-spirited;\
  \ she drinks passionfruit LaCroix and goes to her boss\u2019s drag shows in Brooklyn.\
  \ \nJacqueline so desperately wanted to seem Parisian that she wore a beret, red\
  \ lipstick, and mini tote every day (the kind that is open at the top), while she\
  \ mocked my TSA lock on my backpack zippers. \nShe must not have been a very convincing\
  \ Parisian because on our second-to-last day, while we were in the metro station,\
  \ she was pickpocketed. Gone was her wallet (with all of her money), our key to\
  \ the apartment (she insisted she was responsible enough to carry it even though\
  \ I protested the first 3 days), and her passport. \nJacqueline was eerily calm.\
  \ The kind of calm that is infuriating. I insisted we report it to the police even\
  \ though she didn\u2019t want to. At the police station, she didn\u2019t communicate\
  \ with the cops, so I spoke to them using my Google translate app. I had to contact\
  \ our AirBNB host to explain to him that we lost the key and \u201Cwould it be possible\
  \ for him to stop by at midnight to let us in the apartment even though we knew\
  \ he was studying for an exam he had the next day?\u201D\nLastly, we had to get\
  \ Jacqueline a new passport because she couldn\u2019t leave without one \u2013 though\
  \ at this point that sounded less like a threat and more like an exciting prospect.\
  \ The plan was for her to wake up first thing in the morning and go to the US Embassy\
  \ before they stopped letting people in. Although the Embassy website said otherwise,\
  \ she insisted she would be able to pay the fee with her last blank check \u2013\
  \ surely, they would make an exception for the girl with a Breton top and killer\
  \ red lip. \nA few hours later, I woke up to a ringing phone and mousy voice on\
  \ the other line, \u201Cthey won\u2019t take my check. Can you come pay for it?\u201D\
  \ \nThankfully, my walk to the Embassy was beautiful. I took the scenic route, walking\
  \ past the Classical Le Palais Royal, striking Louvre pyramid, and peaceful Seine\
  \ River before being met by dozens of security guards outside the Embassy who were\
  \ ready to take everything from me except my underwear and unhealthy coping mechanisms.\
  \ \nOnce inside, I became very aware of my surroundings, seeing as I had no cell\
  \ phone to play Candy Crush. I remember the wood paneling in the waiting room, the\
  \ vending machine that seemed to only spit out wafer cookies, and the dozens of\
  \ families that were exhausted from waiting for hours with young children. \nFinally,\
  \ Jacqueline was called up to the booth and, since I was essentially her sugar daddy,\
  \ I was too. The attendant let Jacqueline know that since she had lost her passport\
  \ multiple times, they would only issue her a six-month passport.\n\u201CMultiple\
  \ times!?\u201D I interrogated.\n\u201CWell, there were the two times my parents\
  \ misplaced it, the time I lost it in Rome, the time\u2026\u201D\n\u201CAnd if you\
  \ lose it again, you will not be given another one for a very long time,\u201D the\
  \ attendant retorted.\n$135 and one temporary passport later, Jacqueline and I walked\
  \ back towards the apartment, debating where we should grab a late lunch. We stopped\
  \ into an empty caf\xE9 where we ordered stale crepes and lukewarm hot chocolate.\n\
  \u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D she apologized. \u201CThis wasn\u2019t fair to you.\u201D\
  \n\u201CThank you,\u201D I replied. \u201CAnd I\u2019m sorry I was so hard on you.\u201D\
  \n\u201CNext time, I\u2019ll be more careful.\u201D\n\u201CNext time?\u201D I joked.\
  \ \u201CThey might not even let you out of the country again.\u201D\n\u201CDo you\
  \ think I can borrow one of your TSA locks?\u201D\n\u201COnly if you let me borrow\
  \ your beret.\u201D\n\u201CDeal.\u201D"
