Text: "Yesterday I crossed the Ganges, the most contaminated and sacred river simultaneously\
  \ in India. All that with an alone aim: to come in the afternoon to the ceremonies\
  \ of cremation outdoors in the Ghat de Manikarnika. \n \nImagine a opened building\
  \ temple looking to the Ganges and with terraces of several levels. There 3500 years\
  \ ago Shiva it initiated the fire that nevermore went out and for the Hinduism the\
  \ dream of every person is to die and to be cremated on this river. I must admit\
  \ that during the day I was afraid of going to look the death closely and to face\
  \ but it knew that it was a cycle to close this trip and continue learning to value\
  \ of the life. On having come I realized that I was almost the only woman and tourist\
  \ in the place, since the women do not go, the police prohibited it a few years\
  \ ago when the wifes or mothers were throwing themselves to the fire to die with\
  \ his dear. There they burn between 200 and 350 bodies a day to alive fire, and\
  \ about the temple there are people simply expecting to die while you are looking\
  \ that spend and spend bodies in a stretcher of wrapped bamboo of sheets and colors.\
  \ First they put them to the river to purify his soul, then there has to dress of\
  \ white the person who will initiate the fire, later depending on the money of your\
  \ family they buy wood that is distributed by the whole place: that of palm is the\
  \ cheapest and that of oak the most expensive. One begins to pile up the wood of\
  \ tidy form, then it puts on the body and finally a couple of trunks more above.\
  \ The fire gives 5 returns before beginning to be hot to the body for the connection\
  \ with 5 elements, a prayer is done and begins the fire. I see around me and this\
  \ happen every 5 minutes a space does not exist only for the cremation they are\
  \ 15 at the same time, Manikarnika not for the 24 hrs. \n\nI connect with several\
  \ families that are burning his dear being and it makes me sad ... but it is prohibited\
  \ cry, if someone cry the  body does not liberate and remains caught in the land.\n\
  \nThe hours pass and I am impressed, it gives me shiver to see as the body already\
  \ has been consumed between flames, I see the feet of the person disclosed and on\
  \ the knee having be burned, the leg falls down ... as if it was one more trunk,\
  \ I cannot believe what I see and a type approaches and says to me: without crying!\
  \ And it tells me that then when there should languish the body the person who initiated\
  \ the fire, strip waters down of the Ganges towards the ashes and backward and nevermore\
  \ it gives return his look if the body does it is not liberated ... it is there\
  \ when the relation is cut by the body and the body already does not cost anything.\
  \ There are dogs and sadhus hoping that a piece of body stays to be able to eat\
  \ it, since often the families do not have a lot of money and the bodies stay to\
  \ way to consume (the men generally the chest and the women the hips the hardest\
  \ parts) and there if these 2 carnivorous ones do not eat them, they are thrown\
  \ to the Ganges by stones in order that it goes to the bottom, this way it happens\
  \ also with the body of the sadhus, children, pregnant women and leporosos they\
  \ represent the innocence and purification therefore are not cremated go away direct\
  \ to the river.\n\nBetween of this so sad landscape something inside me was feeling\
  \ happiness because in spite of being living through so strong this I felt that\
  \ there was love, community, values and respect . I was happy for the person who\
  \ died, for being able to be liberated and be in the place that wanted to be, indeed\
  \ Varanasi you demolished the head. I am ready to come back home, undoubtedly with\
  \ an internal very big change in me."
