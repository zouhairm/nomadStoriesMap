Text: "So there I was a lonely 6th-grade student traveling with the school. This travel\
  \ was for learning the history of Ouro Preto and It was my first time visiting.\
  \ It was about 2:20 pm when the students and the teachers were finishing lunchtime.\
  \ I was the one who finished first, so I thought I could leave the restaurant for\
  \ a moment to buy some presents for my mom. I didn't notice how long I was walking\
  \ and where I was, but I was so in love about the place, that time didn't exist\
  \ for me at that moment. I thought that I was in a dream. And me, someone that loves\
  \ Harry Potter, at that time, the feeling seemed I was inside a magical world. \n\
  Walking down Ouro Preto streets it is very different from other cities in Brazil.\
  \ History there it is everywhere. People you don't know say \"Hello\" to you as\
  \ they know you for a very long time that you can feel comfortable there. All the\
  \ history is preserved. The churches around the city are the most beautiful ones.\
  \ The aircraft inside is like telling how heaven looks like. You can see lots of\
  \ angels flying in a peaceful way that you can feel the human faith in every detail.\
  \ The colors bring a calm feeling when you look at it and they connect with the\
  \ image expressions transmitting a lot of feelings and interpretations. The baroque\
  \ sculptures made by Aleijadinho feels the same way. They are intact that you could\
  \ see the perfection made by someone who hands aren't perfect. The details of the\
  \ characters faces, the lines, and volume of the clothes, the curve of the muscles,\
  \ the eyes are penetrating, everything was made with so much detail, that you could\
  \ cry analyzing the author's history with his creations. It's divine. Aleijadinho\
  \ was and is an inspiration.\nOuro Preto is a rich historical city and I realized\
  \ at that moment that visiting for one day It wasn't enough.\nI asked a lady about\
  \ the time and I was late. I ran into a very nice store that looked like an old\
  \ mansion in the Colony time, with blue doors. I think it was 3 huge doors with\
  \ 2 huge windows in front. The walls were white and the woods of the doors and windows\
  \ were blue. The paintings were fresh, so they notice they maintain the old design,\
  \ cause a lot of historic houses there are the same. When you get inside the store,\
  \ you can feel a nice smell of old wood, that makes you feel you are at home. Later,\
  \ A lady sold me a gold shaving inside a flask with oil, she told me that brings\
  \ wealth and an image of Santa Nossa Senhora da Concei\xE7\xE3o, patron of Brazil.\
  \ After that, I ran looking for a restaurant, but I couldn't remember where it was.\
  \ The streets of Ouro Preto are a wonderful maze, people who don't know well could\
  \ get lost, but loosing there it's not a bad thing at all, because of the places\
  \ that we could visit during this lost time. There you can find mixed age histories,\
  \ the baroque and rococo together inside a church. You can participate in worship\
  \ on Saturday night. Memorable gifts are easy to find, saints, necklace, and bracelets\
  \ with precious stones of Ouro Preto. And there are very nice places to stay. There\
  \ are hostels that were houses of very important people at the colony time. It's\
  \ worth to try a visit for some days.\nAt the end of this adventure, I found the\
  \ restaurant with a guide help. My teachers looked at me so furious after I found\
  \ them with my colleges. But, see from my perspective: I was in a historic city\
  \ that looks like a magical world, with kind people and lots of places to go to.\
  \ The anxiety takes over me and I just couldn't lose the opportunity.\nIn the end,\
  \ they were furious, but it worth every minute."
