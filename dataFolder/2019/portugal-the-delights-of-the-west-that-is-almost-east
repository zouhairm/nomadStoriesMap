Text: "Growing up in Hungary made me sensitive for spotting the marks or scars that\
  \ history cast on a city and its urbanscape. Once stunning, but now run down buildings,\
  \ empty sites where houses were meant to stand all summon a distinct sort of melancholy\
  \ appearing even from the disrepair of buildings or the forceful attempt to satisfy\
  \ tourists needs. Nevertheless, the melancholy of the present and the ghost of the\
  \ past's glory could charm the open-eyed visitor. It produces sites that are representing\
  \ the historical moments and districts that will have an outstanding atmosphere.\
  \ The first encounter of streets, squares, alleyways and all the other elements\
  \ of a city can bear an inimitable authenticity. I felt similar when I spend a few\
  \ days in Porto. Actually, I felt like I'm in my home town but in a Portuguese or\
  \ Mediterranean edition. What the two countries' history have in common is the long\
  \ gone prosperous period that was followed by times of being vulnerable to the changes\
  \ in the course of history. Both cities have the sign of being on the periphery\
  \ of Europe. They are charming because they are still ruined, but beautiful too,\
  \ because once it was not like that. However, let us turn back to Porto because\
  \ It is truly a unique city despite the similarities that I just mentioned. It is\
  \ not only unique because it is built on the shores of a river delta, but because\
  \ it still belongs to the locals. Of course, there are tourists like myself everywhere\
  \ in the centre, but locals could still keep it also for themselves. It is easy\
  \ who is local and who is not. While I was walking on the streets, I hardly heard\
  \ anyone speaking English. Also, people in the centre are living their everyday\
  \ life in their extraordinary environment that is so European but at the same time\
  \ so unique. I remember taking a journey to a temple on one of the hills surrounding\
  \ the city centre when I thought to stop, sit down and open my bottle of wine and\
  \ enjoy it while looking at the river dividing the city. Sure enough, I needed a\
  \ screwdriver. I went to the first shop or cafe, sometimes its hard to tell the\
  \ difference, and asked an elderly woman, the sort of type that looks like everybody's\
  \ mother in the whole world and asked if she could help me with that bottle. She\
  \ was clearly having some sort of argument with the assumable members of her family.\
  \ I did not speak Portuguese so I only could sense that it might not be the right\
  \ moment to bother her. However, I was wrong. When she noticed me, she started to\
  \ talk to me with a smile on her face in a welcoming manner. She did not know how\
  \ to speak English, but despite the lack of common language, we understood each\
  \ other. A few minutes later, I had my bottle opened and I felt more like a guest\
  \ rather than a visitor in the city. All because of a friendly and welcoming human\
  \ interaction between me and a local old woman. \nSuch encounters can offer a chance\
  \ to experience some of the locality or the local habits and manners of the city's\
  \ people. According to my experiences, most of the time these encounters require\
  \ a journey into the less touristy parts of the city. Or, a journey to Portugal,\
  \ where I have witnessed many other little things that truly deliver an authentic\
  \ charm. It still feels like a Mediterranean country but for someone from Eastern\
  \ Europe, it reveals those attributes that can be easily associated with, for example,\
  \ the Hungarian capital, Budapest. I would like to go back, discover Portugal more\
  \ because it is almost being in another version of my home, where everything is\
  \ different but familiar at the same time."
