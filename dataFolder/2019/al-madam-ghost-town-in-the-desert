Text: "In mid-October, I stayed in Ras Al Khaimah, the emirate in the north of the\
  \ United Arab Emirates. To go 80 kilometers inland, in Sharjah, I had to wake up\
  \ at half past three. I met dawn already in the desert near the town of Al Madam,\
  \ where the red dunes slowly turn the village, left by people in the seventies,\
  \ into nothing burning in a frying pan of desert.\n\nIt is not difficult to get\
  \ close to a handful of abandoned houses on a large SUV that Arabs love so much.\
  \ At Al Madam Ghost Village, they occasionally arrange a jeep safari, climbing sand\
  \ ridges and going down to the door gates buried in the sand. Neat courtyards, rooms\
  \ with turquoise walls and pink furniture, the green turret of the minaret turned\
  \ into decorations for the \u201CWoman in the Sands\u201D by Kobo Abe \u2014 or\
  \ to the advertising for the Land Cruiser. The locals gradually left home, tired\
  \ of fighting the rising sand. For decades, the dunes have penetrated into the houses,\
  \ filled the voids and tanks. So in slow motion it looks like a flood.\n\nYou can\
  \ still enter in each of the sixteen houses and a small mosque. Sand squeezed out\
  \ the window panes and knocked down the doors, the wind created in the rooms dune\
  \ peaks that will soon meet the ceiling. The inhabitants of the houses lived simply\
  \ \u2014 they painted the walls of typical rooms with bright colors, glued wallpaper\
  \ and simple tiles with fragments of colored glass. What happened on a wide street\
  \ between two rows of houses is already impossible to determine \u2014 the dragon\
  \ crest of sand has risen above fences and roofs.\n\nhttps://babooshkina.ru/2017/10/27/al-madam/"
