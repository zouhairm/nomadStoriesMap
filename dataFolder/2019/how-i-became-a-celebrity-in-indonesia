Text: "Travelling to Asia was a dream and it came true when I visited one of my friends\
  \ in Indonesia. It was a great opportunity to go there, since Maria, my friend,\
  \ had already been living there because of the Darmasiswa program. That meant that\
  \ we could travel and live like a local. As it was my first time travelling outside\
  \ Europe, I knew that it was going to be a life changing experience. But I was prepared\
  \ for everything. Or so I thought. So I booked tickets, packed my backpack and my\
  \ journey started.\nUpon arriving at my destination, a small airport in Solo, I\
  \ soon realized that some people kept staring at me, especially children. It was\
  \ the kind of stare that makes you wonder whether you had a crazy-green-coloured-haircut\
  \ yesterday that you had forgot about. I thought it was my mind playing games, as\
  \ a result of my long flight. But as soon as I saw Maria, the first thing she said\
  \ was: \u201CWelcome! Get ready! Stardom begins!\u201D I thought of course it was\
  \ a joke. But, being a Caucasian woman in the midst of the rural Indonesia feels\
  \ just like that: being a celebrity. Every time we interacted with locals, someone\
  \ always came up and asked us to take a picture with him. Not just a picture, but\
  \ a selfie with their smartphone. And we were the strange and magical beings called\
  \ \u201Cbules\u201D.\n\u201CBule\u201D is the word the locals use when they see\
  \ a fair hair and skin foreigner. And \u201Cbules\u201D are a rare thing to encounter,\
  \ especially in the small villages that we traveled throughout Indonesia. Until\
  \ then, I was used to be only behind the camera, taking pictures of places and people,\
  \ and now suddenly, because of my skin and hair colour, I had to be in front of\
  \ the camera.  \nSo people called us \u201Cbules\u201D and people took pictures\
  \ of us, some for their Instagram account and some wanted us for advertising their\
  \ travel agency or their\u2026 bike club! It was a bit enjoyable and rather interesting\
  \ in the first days I must admit, but this kind of unwanted attention, can soon\
  \ start bothering you. We were interrupted in everything we did. Spending 20 days\
  \ in Indonesia, you just cannot be in the mood for taking selfies every day with\
  \ strangers. Most Indonesians asked permission politely and with a smile. There\
  \ were also some that were a bit rude and persistent, fortunately only a few. \n\
  Of course it did not matter where we were: in the middle of a jungle watching Orangutans,\
  \ strolling by the sea on a tropical island, riding a GoJek (motorcycles used as\
  \ a taxi) or attending a traditional funeral where people gather to honor their\
  \ deceased. \nIndonesia is unforgettable; Indonesians are truly kind. The interaction\
  \ with the locals was more interesting that I expected since taking a selfie with\
  \ them, believe it or not, made everything a lot easier! It felt as if with every\
  \ click and every selfie, the imaginary racial wall, was knocked down and our interaction\
  \ was just easier. \nAnd as far as the selfies? What can you do? Smile and move\
  \ on just like a professional celebrity has to do!"
