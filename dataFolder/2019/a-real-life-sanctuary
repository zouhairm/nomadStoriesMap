Text: "We woke up before dawn on our first day in Phuket, Thailand. Cloudy sky accompanied\
  \ us on a 2-hour journey to Phang Nga. Sometimes the rain would also say hello.\
  \ Along with three other people on a van, we were about to spend half of our day\
  \ with a Thai elephant in an ethical elephant sanctuary.\n\nOn our way, our guide\
  \ shared a heart-breaking story about his life when the tsunami hit Thailand in\
  \ 2004. When the disaster happened, he was at home which was away from the beach,\
  \ after finishing his shift as a bartender the night before. Sadly, many of his\
  \ friends were not that lucky. While desperately looking for the remains of his\
  \ friends, he encountered elephants, helping the rescue team to find people underneath\
  \ the collapsed buildings by slowly lifting the ruins. That meaningful experience\
  \ then, altered his life completely. Soon after, he left his job to dedicate his\
  \ life to care for the elephants in hope of educating people about the significance\
  \ of preserving the wild life, especially elephants in Thailand.\n\nThe respect\
  \ that Thai people give for the elephants comes with a history. It was during the\
  \ time when Thailand was still under Burma\u2019s - now Myanmar - control. One day,\
  \ the King of Thai, riding on the back of an elephant, was in front of the Thai\
  \ army march, leading an attack against Burmese army for the freedom of the country.\
  \ The independence was then declared and the praise did not only go for the Thai\
  \ King, but also the elephant, that made Thailand a free nation.\n\nBy 9 in the\
  \ morning, we arrived at the office of the sanctuary and after spending a few minutes\
  \ getting ready, our guide took us on a pick-up truck to visit Kong Di, a 6 year-old,\
  \ former male circus elephant. When we got to the sanctuary, we were handed bananas\
  \ and banana leaves and took turn to feed him. With two bananas on my hand, I nervously\
  \ walked towards him that stood behind a small wooden fence not higher than my stomach.\
  \ I called his name and soon after, he curled up his trunk, so I could place bananas\
  \ on his tongue. As a thank you, he placed his trunk on my cheek to kiss me.\n\n\
  After having his morning snacks, it was time for Kong Di to take a bath in a huge\
  \ pool where Kong Di invited us to have a water fight with him. It was a no-brainer\
  \ who the winner was. With just one big spray of water from his trunk, we eventually\
  \ waved our white flag. Then, he walked with pride to the centre of the pool, waiting\
  \ for his prize: being scrubbed. His carer first demonstrated the proper way to\
  \ bathe him all while our guide mentioned that the skills of the elephant caretaker\
  \ in this sanctuary have been handed down from generation to generation, which means\
  \ that once Kong Di\u2019s carer is retired, the job is later handed to his son.\
  \ \n\nThe next bath was said to be his favourite: a mud bath. While watching him\
  \ rolling in the mud and spraying it all over his body, we prepared his favourite\
  \ big meal: a banana sticky rice. We placed a banana on sticky rice, then wrapped\
  \ it in a banana leaf. The little bundle was later secured by a soft banana leaf\
  \ midrib before we gave it to him and that wrapped up our day with Kong Di.\n\n\
  My heart was warm when Kong Di said his goodbye with his front leg crossed over\
  \ the other while he trumpeted as he curled up his trunk, waving it side to side.\
  \ On our journey back, I reflected on how valuable my encounter with Kong Di was.\
  \ The story of our guide and Kong Di\u2019s carer also gives me hope that every\
  \ living thing on this planet has a chance to create a real-life sanctuary where\
  \ we can take good care of each other. All that is left now is a will to make it\
  \ happen."
