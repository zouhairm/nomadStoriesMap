Text: "In 2004, in a small city called Francisco Beltr\xE3o, inside Paran\xE1 state,\
  \ south of Brazil, lived a girl, in her 19 years old, who dreamed of seeing the\
  \ sea. Between her and her dream 588 Km, many cities, include the state capital,\
  \ beyond her inexperience and little information about travels. But she had decided\
  \ to turn her dream come true, and started to make a plan.\n  The first plan step\
  \ was to choose the destination. There was a coastal city called Matinhos, where\
  \ some people of Francisco Beltr\xE3o used to go on holidays, it was a relatively\
  \ near and cheap beach. Then, after checking the prices of the tickets and the average\
  \ price of the hotels, the place was chosen.\n   The next pass was to save money.\
  \ She worked in a simple job but lived with her parents, therefore 3 months later\
  \ she had enough money. The last and not less important step was finding a partner\
  \ in crime, someone who could go with her in this adventure. It was facile, her\
  \ brother, 3 years young seemed the perfect company.\n  The days have passed, the\
  \ date expected finally came. On a Wednesday night, carnival eve, the siblings departed\
  \ for their first trip without parental supervision. They were anxious and excited,\
  \ the night was long, 9 hours on the bus, but at 6 o\u2019clock they were in Curitiba,\
  \ the state capital, where they should change the coach. The Curitiba bus station\
  \ is big and was full and too noisy, their curious eyes searched for the bus that\
  \ could take them at the destination. Fortunately, 2 hours later, they were glad\
  \ on a bus to Matinhos.\n  The roadway Curitiba-Matinhos, it\u2019s inside the Serra\
  \ do Mar, an amazing and the largest area of Atlantic forest in Brazil. They could\
  \ appreciate, by the bus window, the scenery, a significant number of mountains\
  \ covered in green, some rivers and waterfalls and a wide variety of trees, flowers,\
  \ and fruits by the side of the road. This part of the trip passed so quickly, in\
  \ 2 hours and a half they were in Matinhos.  \n  They expected to see the sea upon\
  \ arriving in the city, but they landed at the bus station, took a taxi towards\
  \ the center, came at the hotel and still had no sign of the ocean. At this time,\
  \ their anxiety had risen quite higher, and they just left their bags in the hotel\
  \ and went out looking for the sea.\n  Matinhos is a typical Brazilian beach town,\
  \ with about 33 thousand inhabitants, in the summer it receives thousands of visitors\
  \ who leave the streets and especially the sandy beach in front of the sea, crowded.\
  \ They walked around the city, asking for information from the people met along\
  \ the way, and trying to hear some noise from the ocean to know which direction\
  \ to go. After 15 minutes walking, the girl sighted through a gap between the houses\
  \ a little piece of the sea, \u201Cit\u2019s there!\" she screamed excitedly, and\
  \ both ran towards the sea.\n  In front of the sea, her eyes got lost in the immensity\
  \ of the blue, she never had seen anything so grand, in her face, the expression\
  \ of admiration followed by a smile was natural, she was pleased. The sea was beautiful\
  \ and awoke in her feelings of peace and respect at the same time. She imagined\
  \ what would exist in the depths of those waters and beyond the blue horizon. She\
  \ enjoyed every moment of the following days, along with her brother to explore\
  \ the beaches and other attractions of the city.\n  Today, the girl who dreamed\
  \ of seeing the sea is writing this story. She crossed the ocean and currently lives\
  \ in another continent. She met some countries and cultures and dreams of knowing\
  \ much more. Seeing the sea taught her that realizing dreams is possible, you just\
  \ need to believe and fight for them. So, if you met a smiling woman, observing\
  \ everything with admiration and curiosity like a girl, maybe it\u2019s her, who\
  \ is exploring a new city, beach or mountain. See you somewhere!"
