Text: "I had never backpacked  before. The fear was there, but I just dismissed it\
  \ by fantasising about  what the future held . As I exited Mozambique (where I was\
  \ a little bit comfortable, because it is closer to South Africa), I was literally\
  \ lost, not knowing where and how to proceed to my next point. \n\nFrom the bus\
  \ I had boarded from Chimoio (Mozambique), a lean and tall gentlemen who spoke no\
  \ English at all, (still today, I wonder, how I got through him), was very helpful.\
  \ He explained to me, that there was no bus to the border from Tete (Mozambique)\
  \ and Malawi (Mwanza Border), so we had to hitchhike. Fortunately, a cargo truck\
  \ (big lorry) came along, and we jumped in, a no no in my country.\n\nI still believe\
  \ that without curiosity, none of this would have taken place. At the border, there\
  \ were many tourist buses, ferrying both Black and White travellers. As I entred\
  \ the border, the driver told me right away that I needed to get the bribe money\
  \ ready. \n\nI was shocked to see long queues, and I knew that if I insisted on\
  \ staying on the queue, I wouldn't get to Blantyre, (first Malawian town, I had\
  \ to lodge at). Along the way, mud huts sprung. Soon after arriving in Blantyre,\
  \ I saw Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). I jumped for joy, like a small child. I had\
  \ been on the road for about a 2 days, and away from home about a week. However,\
  \ upon ordering my meal, I was soon disappointed because their menus were not similar\
  \ to our South African ones. \n\nIn the morning, I got my  8L yellow backpack  bag\
  \ ready, and I walked, armed with directions and a tourist guide pack. Along the\
  \ way, I met people who clearly had never met a black female backpacker, obviously,\
  \ from the stares I was receiving. I also met business buildings such as hair saloons,\
  \ tuck shops and churches that just had strange names such as \"Let's Make Love,\
  \ Not War Restaurant\"  \"Love of God Saloon\"\n\nFrom Blantyre, I had to take a\
  \ minibus to Zomba and it was raining. Fortunately, I had an umbrella. To my shock,\
  \ I discovered that the culture of manners was not similar to mine. The taxi conductor\
  \ just snatched my umbrella and went outside to get more customers. When I tried\
  \ to address him, the other passengers, bantly told me, that he would bring it back,\
  \ he was just doing his job. What made me even more annoyed, was that because it\
  \ was before Christmas, the taxi fare was more by a 100 Kwacha. \n\nUpon arriving\
  \ in Mangochi, a town before, Monkey Bay, which would be my destination for 2 days,\
  \ there was no public transport, so we had to hitchhike. I didn't believe what I\
  \ had subjected myself to. Packed like sardines in that small lorry, I arrived in\
  \ Monkey Bay, it was already dark,  and a lady I found along the way, assisted me\
  \ in translating to the local bicycle \"drivers\" whose  business in ferrying customers.\
  \  \n\nI got a ride from this old gentleman, in the dark, it was only hope that\
  \ kept me positive about the whole experience. We rode up into Venice Beach Lodge.\
  \ The use of the word beach was a bit amusing for me, because I knew that Malawi\
  \ is a landlocked country, it has no sea. Anyway, that is how they see their lake,\
  \ Lake Malawi. It is indeed a huge body of water. As I sat at the bar, sipping water,\
  \ I could hear the water slashing on the shore. \n\nIn the morning, with other guest,\
  \ we were treated to a lake fish braai or barbecue. We were transported by an old\
  \ engine boat (with cracks everywhere) constantly waving off Tsetse flies, with\
  \ occasional stops, to purchase  fish.\n\nWhile the fish was sizzling, I decided\
  \ to stand in the water, on the edge and take a photo, after seeing small children\
  \ swimming like fish, I thought I could also get into the water, with no water experience,\
  \ nor swimming lessons, I thank God, I am still alive today. All I can remember,\
  \ is touching death with my hands."
