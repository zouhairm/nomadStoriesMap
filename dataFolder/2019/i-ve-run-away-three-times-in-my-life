Text: "Maybe I haven't run away, maybe I've run to something. Although, I've never\
  \ really known what I was running to, other than the adventure of the unknown. \n\
  \nThe first time I ran was at the age of 17 when I joined the military to pay for\
  \ school. This was an easy one because the military is a bit like boarding school\
  \ with an adult twist. They tell you what to do, when to do it and how to do it.\
  \ They give you a place to live and a job. It was a means to an end for me; I wanted\
  \ to go to University and the military was the only way I could see at the time\
  \ to pay for it. At seventeen, I did not understand the consequences of signing\
  \ a military contract for eight years, but I got through it. I did my six active\
  \ years plus two inactive years in the National Guard, got my degrees and then said\
  \ goodbye to that chapter of my life.\n\nThen at 25, I really ran. I took a teaching\
  \ job near Paris. I happily packed up everything, left the US and for what was supposed\
  \ to be a year teaching gig. I didn't have a place to live, but the allure of Europe\
  \ and my youthful confidence made that detail seem minor. The year somehow stretched\
  \ to five as I explored Paris and the continent. \n\nGrowing tired of squeezing\
  \ all my worldly possessions into eighteen square meters, I decided it was time\
  \ to run away again. I couldn't decide between moving back to the US or Australia,\
  \ so I tossed a coin. Heads, I would to move to Australia. Tails, I would move back\
  \ to the US. Lucky me, it turned up heads, so I got rid of all my winter clothes\
  \ and bought a flight for down under. This time I didn't have a job or a place to\
  \ live - minor details. I only planned on staying long enough to learn how to surf\
  \ then I would find another place to call home for a while. Nine years later, and\
  \ I've given up on the idea of  ever surfing.\n\nI am feeling the urge to run away\
  \ again. I am not sure where. I became an Australian citizen last year. I have Italian\
  \ citizenship so I can move back to Europe. And I have American citizenship so I\
  \ can easily go back to the US, but I don't like easy. I guess when I review all\
  \ the things I have done in my life, most of the highlights center around travelling,\
  \ preparing to travel, or the expectation of travel. And I imagine that is why I\
  \ am always running away.  Maybe next time I run I will be better prepared with\
  \ a job and a place to live, but where's the fun in that?"
