Text: "After a while calling myself a nomad and wandering  around Central America,\
  \ I met Diego, another lonely soul. Love at first ride, we decided to connect our\
  \ journeys, backpacks and lack of money. Our path led us to Samara \u2013 a small\
  \ village on the pacific side of Costa rica, inhabited by surfers and expats. We\
  \ set up out tent and went to explore the city and maybe find a job. \nSamara is\
  \ all about local. It has no chain hotels or fast food restaurants, and no multi-story\
  \ buildings. Jungle, ocean, palms and sandy beaches. It was low season, few tourists,\
  \ few open stores. But there was a a cosy travel agency with a huge sign, written:\
  \ ARRIBADA, HOY. That one word made my heart stop.  \nThe arribada is a phenomenon\
  \ where hundreds of thousands sea turtles come to one specific mile of the beach\
  \ to dig their egs. I simply could not believe that, without planning, I ended up\
  \ in the right time, close  (or not so much) to the scenery of a rarely-seen biological\
  \ wonder. However the Pura vida has a high price and life in Costa Rica can be expensive\
  \ for two southamerican nomads. We had absolutley no money to book a tour. \n-Let\u2019\
  s hitchhike. - Said Diego. \nDiego is a proud and typical argentinean who loves\
  \ football and adventures. Hitchhiking would be easy if our destination were not\
  \ so far and if we had enough time. The arribada was happening for days and it was\
  \ our last and only chance to watch the turtle\u2019s arrival. We tried to find\
  \ a bus that would go on that direction, but there was none.  Now or never, our\
  \ hitchhiking started. No bus, no money, no information. We only knew  that the\
  \ place to go was called Ostional National Park and that it was probably the last\
  \ day they were laying their eggs. Since asking for a ride is not always easy, we\
  \ left in the morning to rise our chances of arriving in the late afternoon, when\
  \ the spectacle happens. \n \tLike kids with new toys, we were happy because a new\
  \ adventure was about to start. We were singing, dancing and making instagram stories\
  \ while walking in the Ostional directon and asking for a ride. So it happened.\
  \ That was easy. The driver was a surfer and left us in the next town. Awesome.\
  \ Every meter counts. But what happened next felt like a dream. \nWe waited for\
  \ a few minutes while walking and laughing, when a luxury and expensive car stoped.\
  \ He said he could leave us 3 kilometers in front. We agreed. Conversation started\
  \ and he was interested in our life story. So he decided to go a little further\
  \ to hear us more. That was already fantastic. But when he realized my partner was\
  \ called Diego he stoped the car and told us he would drive us untill our final\
  \ destination. I panicked. We all know hitchhiking is not really safe these days\
  \ and that man were too helpful and interested. How could he divert his route hundreds\
  \ of kilometers to leave us? That was strange. \nI did not know what to do because\
  \ despite the strangeness, he was being nice and respectful. We thought we would\
  \ take the whole day to get to our stop when, magically, a good soul drove us all\
  \ the way to see turtles. \nWhen we reached our destinations we realized that what\
  \ we talked and shared in that  car was equally beautiful to what we were about\
  \ to see. And only because he was a huge fan of Diego Maradona, the football player."
