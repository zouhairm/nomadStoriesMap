Text: "My travel experience now  begins with Egypt trip  on 22nd, 08/2014  right from\
  \ my village where I first slaughtered a sheep and gathered my village to  eat and\
  \ to grace my journey. \nEverybody in the village was happy  and  I guessed my father\
  \ who died several years ago  might have  smiled in the heaven and told  his colleagues\
  \  that his son is the first person to board plane in Olua land  to go to Egypt.\n\
  Somebody might think  with all   my beautiful experiences in journalism I have my\
  \ entire life ahead of me,  but this is fact about me when I used plane for the\
  \ first time.\nI  had comfort with my people at home and was always with relatives\
  \ boarding the plane was a big miracle in my village.\nFinally I left  my village\
  \ to come to Kampala and to the Entebbe International airport, while fearing  that\
  \ I would miss the flight  and I was  also praying and trying to think of other\
  \ things.\nWhile  reaching at the   airport  I saw people lining for the security\
  \ checks,  I approached counter four which was for Ethiopian airline, I saw my bag\
  \ been rolled away and I  started making alarm that my bag is been taking away it\
  \ drew passengers into laughter and also drew the attention of airport security.\n\
  They asked me whether it was my first time to travel I told them yes its my first\
  \ time to travel and am going to Cairo, then they assured me that am now going to\
  \ find my nag in  Cairo. \nNow time to get into the plane came which was again another\
  \ problem I could walk with a lot of fear  though with some excitement \nFinally\
  \ I found myself  in the plane, I had never traveled by air so this was a new experience\
  \  but during the time of boarding, my legs would shake  and I couldn\u2019t  open\
  \ the compartment above my head to drop my small bag which was having laptop not\
  \ until kind passenger  helped me.\nPeople were told to fasten their seat belts\
  \ I tried to follow instructions, but  I couldn\u2019t do mine and I failed to locate\
  \ the belts my palms were sweaty, my neighbor belted me and told me to be  alert\
  \  because the plane  is taxiing  soon  down the runway  where it will put so much\
  \ pressure  in the cabin. \n When the  plane was about to take off  I closed my\
  \ eyes not wanting others to notice, I held my  seat  and prayed for about 5 minutes\
  \ thinking that I will fall, it burdened my heart and I felt like it was my last\
  \ day on earth.\nThe plane  taxied its way to the end of the runway and then suddenly\
  \ the engine started running at full speed and momentarily I was pushed back in\
  \ my seat in few seconds I found myself  in the air  watching Kampala and Lake Victoria.\
  \ What I did was to drop down a piece of note that I am in the plane which if flying\
  \ over Kampala city.\nWhen it leveled out into the sky I thought okay not so bad\
  \ but it suddenly dropped I inwardly panicked internally shrieking oh my God we\
  \ are going to crash and as weird  as  this may sound to some people I actually\
  \ heard a gentle voice telling me to calm down and look to the other people,  I\
  \ gained confidence. \nI felt really cold in the plane  and it was  bobbing  and\
  \ shuddering  as it encountered something  and heavy rainclouds I thought this was\
  \ the end for me finally. I could walk in the aisle with a lot of  wobbling.  \n\
  Another  embarrassment I got was  with lavatory, I didn\u2019t know how to open\
  \ it and when  the flight attendant helped me still inside I failed to offload myself\
  \ because of fear. \nCertainly,  with my experience you can laugh about it but \
  \ it was far from funny from a person like me who did not  find the skies quite\
  \ so friendly.\nI descended from the plane entered the shuttle   I saw people holding\
  \ onto the rails but I did not hold the rails when the  bus started moving  I fell\
  \ down hard."
