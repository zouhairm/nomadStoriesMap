Text: "\"Our trip is ruined\", my boyfriend said to me.\nIt was the morning of our\
  \ second to a 8-day trip, and we were on a bus going to Gramado, city of Rio Grande\
  \ do Sul state, one of most romantic trips you can take in Brazil. The day before\
  \ we were assaulted by two guys in Porto Alegre, the state\u2019s capitol. I've\
  \ never been robbed until that day, and the shock and sadness were still on me.\n\
  Our first trip together, started with the wrong foot. \n\"I hope we are wrong\"\
  \ I thought to myself, while the buildings and concrete was giving space to trees\
  \ and nature by the bus window.\nThankfully we were wrong.\nEven though it was a\
  \ 2-hour travel, it seemed that we were in another country: The buildings were small\
  \ and very german-ish (a gift from the European immigrants that populated the country\
  \ after the First World War), there were people walking down the street even after\
  \ the sundown, and a sense of community and kindness that was beyond the day by\
  \ day politeness; their hospitality gave us a warm feeling of home.\nWe started\
  \ our trip visiting some old cathedrals and churches, walking by some boulevards\
  \ and narrow streets with lovely stores and coffee shops, trying the most delicious\
  \ chocolates and wines of Brazil (Gramado is known by its wineyard and chocolate\
  \ factory too), exploring beautiful natural landscapes, like peaks and waterfalls,\
  \ ate the most delicious food and explored vineyards and natural parks.\nThe last\
  \ two days of the trip we spared to visit a tiny city near Gramado, called Nova\
  \ Petr\xF3polis, where we booked an AirBnB bedroom. We went by bus, in a very bucolic\
  \ road, giving us a hint of what to expect from the city. Our hosts were so lovely\
  \ and warmly welcomed us in their home. \nWe saw the pictures of their home, so\
  \ we already knew what to expect. But nothing could have prepared us for that.\n\
  The house was on the top of a slope and the back of the house gave to a forest reserve\
  \ and, at sundown, the sky glowed in all beautiful pastel colors. We stayed all\
  \ the afternoon on the balcony admiring the view. \u201CWe don\u2019t need a lot\
  \ to feel in peace\u201D, I thought. Time couldn\u2019t reach us. A minute was an\
  \ hour and an hour was a minute. We escaped from the world and the fear and chock\
  \ from the assault was a fresh but not a harmful memory anymore. In that moment\
  \ we knew: sometimes there are some bumps on the road, but we can\u2019t take the\
  \ eyes from the view."
