Text: "On a large grey generator beside an apartment building, it read, \"Would you\
  \ rather be a fish?\" Well, at the moment, perhaps I would. It was the middle of\
  \ the afternoon and I began to question my decision on leaving all electronics back\
  \ at my hotel room. Today marked my first day abroad and I was all alone. A recipe\
  \ for getting lost. \n\nI decided on being technology free to better enjoy Barcelona.\
  \ And I forgot about not having any form of navigation. I made my way down to the\
  \ subway and found a paper map. Yes, they still exist! I bought a train ticket to\
  \ Saint Josep, and upon my arrival, I realised I was not where I thought I was.\
  \ I ended up in El Putxet, a neighborhood way up north close to the mountains. Rather\
  \ than going back, I decided to stay and explore the little town.\n\nI have never\
  \ been so excited about being lost. The streets were narrow, barely fitting a pedestrian\
  \ and a single car. Wet clothes hung to dry on wires spread out every three or two\
  \ balconies apart. The yellow bricked sidewalk led me to a small bar. There, I bought\
  \ myself hot chocolate with a piece of bread. A man with black sunglasses walked\
  \ up and sat next to me. He reminded me a lot of my great grandfather from back\
  \ home in the states. \n\nI introduced myself, and he said his name was Jordi. Jordi\
  \ was born in 1936. He talked to me about his younger years, when he was blonde\
  \ and threw stones at animals in the forests nearby for entertainment. He was given\
  \ a guitar at a young age, and played through the city's plaza. He would always\
  \ gather just enough money to buy milk and eggs for his mother and father. Jordi\
  \ said he outgrew his guitar, but still uses it to strum the cultural folk songs\
  \ of Catalunya every night before his grandchildren go to bed. He talked about the\
  \ importance of preservation in Catalan history, and how he was proud a young man\
  \ like me was learning the language.\n\nI spoke with Jordi for about to hours and\
  \ after a long while I knew it was time to head out. Jordi took my arm as support\
  \ (just like my great grandfather would) and he insisted on walking with me to the\
  \ steps leading down the metro station. Oddly, Jordi's presence gave me a feeling\
  \ of comfort, as if we knew each other for years. \n\nWe crossed a street down the\
  \ path to the metro when suddenly a taxi passed full speed ahead down the cobble\
  \ streets. Jordi was able to pull me by the back of my arm and saved me from getting\
  \ injured. Jordi hollered an insult I could not understand to the driver, just like\
  \ anyone would on a normal day. I gave him my sincerest thanks, still trying to\
  \ catch my breath. He was blind man, but a very quick one too. \n\nJordi said he\
  \ heard the taxi coming hundreds of feet away before I did and I could not believe\
  \ it. When we arrived to the train station, we finally said our goodbyes. I thanked\
  \ him again. He kept a smile the whole time we were together. I walked down the\
  \ steps and as I looked back up to the top of the stairs, Jordi was gone. Finally,\
  \ I sought out to find my way back to the hotel before it got too dark. I hope there\
  \ are many other travelers who meet him to treat him kindly, and feel the familiar\
  \ comfort he emanated. I have never stopped thinking about Jordi ever since."
