Text: "The city had me. I had to leave. My ancestral family lives in Nepal. Apart\
  \ from my parents I didn't know if I had a family. I was visiting it after a very\
  \ long time. And this time I was traveling alone. Keen on finding an end to the\
  \ story which I was writing about a guy in a similar situation. \nCutting to the\
  \ chase. The place is magical. I had layers of hills around me. When it was sultry\
  \ in Bombay, I was freezing in Nepal, taking sun baths everyday. Got my self a tan.\
  \ Which is not considered a good thing in India. But that didn't stop me. I went\
  \ on treks alone, looking for jaguars in the jungle. Couldn't spot one this time,\
  \ just some leftovers in a den. Well the jungle had new members, deers. The one\
  \ without horns. Locals call it 'raate' which means something that is red in color.\
  \ It was magestic, Himalayas are not the same. Probably even more egoistic. It makes\
  \ you feel how little you are in this universe, with almost to no significance at\
  \ all. Words are not enough to describe it, the most cliched thing to say, but you\
  \ have to experience it. If I had to sum it up, I would say, it was like on LSD\
  \ but sober.\nAnd also I know my family now and it's a huge one, with crazy numbers\
  \ and ages and relationships. I became a grand dad at the age of 23. I have a grandson\
  \ who is 14 days old now. Have you ever been overwhelmed with everything in life?\
  \ Nepal awestucked me and the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.\
  \ Overwhelmed. And yes I found an end to the story.\nFin."
