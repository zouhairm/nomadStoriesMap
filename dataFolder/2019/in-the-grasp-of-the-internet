Text: "An empty mind is a devil\u2019s workshop. This sentence is globally accepted\
  \ but when practically applied, the same workshop might create a fulfilling experience.\
  \ It was a Sunday, and there was nothing to do apart from sitting and staring at\
  \ unsatisfactory objects in the room. Mind was so empty and the day was so lengthy.\
  \ Absence of thought made it hard to plot. Lets go buy some cheap clothes was the\
  \ plan, never would\u2019ve imagined the path that would come find this man. \n\n\
  The local mall was lightened by the crackling and rattling of thousands of customers\
  \ that day.\nSeemed like thousands of cattles trying to eat one hay.\nBought some\
  \ clothes in the sale section, went over to the cashier to pay. Boom! You are the\
  \ lucky winner of this international trip to Paris was the next sentence heard,\
  \ in just a week this man flew like a bird.\n\nAn unknown land is the destination,\
  \ everything is sponsored so its a vacation.\nThe structural planning was so way\
  \ different than what I saw a everyday in my nation\nA week was the the maximum\
  \ i had to lurk around here.\nSo i started exploring using the sign boards over\
  \ there\nI was lost and far away from my hotel room, no one understood my accent\
  \ so i was on my own\nLuckily i found a wifi connection, asked google to find me\
  \ my hotel,\nThanks to the internet i walked 6 miles and finally reached my destination"
