Text: "\u201CThe situation on the ground is constantly changing, so we ask you to\
  \ be flexible.\u201D\n    I\u2019d landed in San Diego about six hours ago. The\
  \ orientation meeting for volunteers heading to Tijuana opened to a chorus of questions:\
  \ Where will I be tomorrow? We\u2019re not sure yet, you\u2019ll hear from us around\
  \ 7pm tonight. What will I be doing? That depends; the need might change between\
  \ now and the morning. Is it safe? There are no guarantees. Where should I stay\
  \ tonight? Or tomorrow? For the rest of the week?\n    The trip itself was prompted\
  \ by a lack of transparency \u2014 from governments, nonprofits, even journalists\
  \ \u2014 about what was really happening at the border between Mexico and the United\
  \ States. There were plenty of rumors. Were there thousands of people waiting to\
  \ cross, or was it only a few hundred? Were they hardened criminals, or women and\
  \ children? Whispers about a grand conspiracy and a threat to America were rampant.\
  \ I knew that whatever decisions were being made, my country was acting as my representative,\
  \ doing it in my name. Wading through the often conflicting stories seemed impossible\
  \ to do from a distance; I had to look at the truth up close. \n    In less than\
  \ twenty-four hours, I was standing in Tijuana outside El Barretal. It had been\
  \ raining for days, turning the streets surrounding the former concert venue-turned\
  \ temporary shelter to mud. We wouldn\u2019t be allowed inside, and there were armed\
  \ soldiers sent by the Mexican government standing guard by the barbed-wire fences\
  \ at the entrance to ensure our compliance. The nearly 2,000 migrants housed there\
  \ were not prisoners, but there weren\u2019t many places for them to go. Shelters\
  \ all over Tijuana were at capacity. Most of the people who came to Tijuana with\
  \ the now-infamous caravan had no money. Traffickers haunted the neighborhood, taking\
  \ advantage of the desperate situation. Some might have been able to get temporary\
  \ work visas in Mexico, but it would come at the expense of risking any asylum claim\
  \ they made in the United States. When they crossed. If they crossed. \n    While\
  \ the average wait time was six weeks, there were plenty who had been stuck in limbo\
  \ for much longer. I met people who had journeyed for months, from as far away as\
  \ Cameroon. Many had been assigned a number in line at El Chaparral. Every morning,\
  \ a dog-eared notebook would be unearthed and handed off to a volunteer asylum-seeker,\
  \ who would read off the next numbers in line. One of the organizations I volunteered\
  \ with had dubbed this The Illegal List. Behind the scenes, U.S. Border Control\
  \ would communicate with the Mexican immigration authorities, telling them how many\
  \ people to let through each day. No law or official policy dictates a limit on\
  \ the number of asylum seekers who can be admitted (which they must do in order\
  \ to make their claim). It is an unpredictable system, with no oversight or clarity.\
  \ \n    The uncertainty wouldn\u2019t end there. The mothers I spoke to were worried\
  \ about being separated from their children. There was no guarantee that their asylum\
  \ claim would be successful, or if they would even be afforded their legal right\
  \ to make their claim at all. Would they be sent to the hieleras, left in a freezing\
  \ cold room for days or weeks? Or would they be sent to a detention center, or a\
  \ prison? Was there a chance they would be released in the U.S., with an ankle monitor\
  \ in the middle of the night, like so many others? Or would they be sent back to\
  \ Mexico? \n    Where will I be?\n    What will I be doing?\n    Is it safe?\n \
  \   They were impossible questions to answer. But no one was asking these refugees\
  \ to be flexible; they were being asked to face the impossible. An indefinite wait,\
  \ asking for help and getting no clear answers. \n    I passed Chaparral on my way\
  \ back to San Diego. U.S. Passport in hand, I walked homeward through a simple gate,\
  \ while behind me refugees climbed into a bus, towards another uncertainty and an\
  \ unknown destination."
