Text: "I met Jane in Haworth, England, in a narrow brick guesthouse tucked between\
  \ a tearoom and an old apothecary shop. The evening had softened the day\u2019s\
  \ heat, just enough, but the streets still hummed, the line of people at the ice\
  \ cream stand shuffled and swayed, one foot to another, as if to cool their heels.\
  \ \n\nCats paced the cobbled alleyways and a line of paper-thin Union Jacks hung\
  \ motionless and still, criss-crossing the square from one end to the other, waiting\
  \ for the the wild wind to sweep down from the moors.\n\nMy room was on the top\
  \ floor of the guest house, a small, square space with a bed in the center and a\
  \ sink in the corner. My blue backpack was propped against the wall, my hiking pants\
  \ and socks were airing out across the windowsill. On the dresser was a stack of\
  \ paper maps, rounds of cheese covered in bright red wax, two small bottles of red\
  \ wine and a book with the image of a girl on the cover.\n\nA bird screeched outside\
  \ my window as I lay stretched on the bed, looking at my feet. They were swollen,\
  \ aching, and blistered. I was four days and 53 miles into the Pennine Way, a 268-mile\
  \ long distance walking route through the moorlands and countryside of northern\
  \ England. Despite having over 200 miles still left to go, I was thinking about\
  \ quitting.\n\nRain had given way to bright sunshine by the end of my first day\
  \ of walking, but the landscape was relentlessly rough, and unforgiving. One blister\
  \ turned to four, and on tired feet I hobbled through the lonely moors, the moors\
  \ I\u2019d dreamt of in the months leading up to my great walking adventure.\n\n\
  This stretch of earth in the West Yorkshire hills was Bront\xEB country, home to\
  \ Emily, Charlotte, and Anne, 19th century poets and novelists whose work often\
  \ wove their beloved moors into their characters lives. This was a remote and barren\
  \ land, one that bristled with low-lying heather, hardy and harsh, with rock strewn\
  \ hills and a tireless wind, a wind that had the power to turn even the sunshine\
  \ cold. \n\nTo reach Haworth, the small mill town where the Bront\xEB sisters spent\
  \ most of their short lives, I had to detour slightly from the path of the Pennine\
  \ Way and continue further into the moors, into the bracken and brush and round\
  \ white puffs of cotton grass. \n\nI passed the crumbling remains of an old stone\
  \ farmhouse, then descended down a rough path and walked for several miles until\
  \ the town of Haworth appeared in the distance. My first stop- before even finding\
  \ my guest house or taking a shower or drinking a pint in the local pub- was to\
  \ tour the Bront\xEB Parsonage Museum and see where the sisters lived and wrote.\
  \ \n\nOn my way out, I paused in the gift shop. A bookshelf was lined with a dozen\
  \ editions of Jane Eyre, and I picked a copy and weighed it in my hands. It was\
  \ heavy, but there, on the cover, was the portrait of a girl: thin-faced and dark-haired,\
  \ with red lips and fierce eyes. \n\nI\u2019d read the story before, but now her\
  \ character came back to me: poor, obscure, plain and little Jane, how she fled\
  \ from her home to fight the wild landscape of the moors. Her desperation, her determination.\
  \ And me, with my pack still heavy on my shoulders, my blistered feet and wind blown\
  \ hair, what had led me here? Alone in this same landscape, with my own desperation,\
  \ my own determination?\n\nLater, up in my room, I tipped a bottle of wine to my\
  \ lips and opened to the first chapter. In the morning I would tuck the book deep\
  \ inside my pack, take a train to save my tired feet, and then continue walking.\
  \ The extra weight of the book in my pack was a small sacrifice, a reminder of the\
  \ companion I now had on this journey, a reminder of the rough and wild landscape\
  \ of the moors. A landscape that was now woven into my own story, my own life."
