Text: "Crunch. crunch. crunch. My dust-caked feet traipsed the unpaved ground below\
  \ me, faded remnants of a henna flower swirling around the tops of my feet. Lost\
  \ in thought, I was vaguely aware of the going-ons around me: a spotted cow, rustling\
  \ through garbage on my left. On my right, a man staring shamelessly at me as he\
  \ leisurely sipped a steaming chai. I was in India, a woman, alone. My friends,\
  \ family, coworkers, neighbours, and even strangers on the train had warned me it\
  \ would be dangerous, difficult to to travel, scary. \"You know what happens on\
  \ those buses, don\u2019t you?\" they implored. Everyone had a story. Although I\
  \ usually travel solo, the seeds of nervousness had been planted before I embarked\
  \ on my journey. However, I had been in this country for three months and hadn\u2019\
  t encountered any of the difficulties I had been warned about- except, of course,\
  \ being rammed by a cow, which although painful and embarrassing, provided exceptional\
  \ entertainment for the witnesses. \n\nAt the same moment I was contemplating my\
  \ good fortune, I became aware of the sound of more feet creeping behind me. Several\
  \ pairs, approaching quickly. The sun, a blazing red ball permanently lurking behind\
  \ a sea of haze, had dipped below the horizon and the streets, usually a frenzy\
  \ of women in saris hustling their goods and the constant blast of motorbike horns,\
  \ was dim and oddly quiet. Just keep walking, I thought. Right, left, right left.\
  \ A lump of fear lodged in my throat as I padded more quickly towards my destination-\
  \ a small, bare room with a minuscule patio that if I craned my neck at a precise\
  \ left angle, I could see the blue-grey water of the Ganges River. Home. Paradise.\
  \ Suddenly I was desperate to get back there. As my body prepared to sprint, my\
  \ followers caught up with me. I had wasted too much time thinking and was now surrounded\
  \ on all sides. The lump in my throat traveled down to meet my heart and together\
  \ they struggled to leap out of my chest. My thoughts were as clear as the Vancouver\
  \ sky I would never see again: coming to India was a bad idea. \n\nAs I squeezed\
  \ my eyes shut, I felt a soft hand slide into my right hand, interlacing their fingers\
  \ with mine. On my other side, a small hand met my left. Confused, I dared to crack\
  \ open one eye. Two dark-eyed, beautiful women cloaked in purple saris squeezed\
  \ my hands, waves of their laughter rolling over me like a warm breeze. Several\
  \ barefoot children trailed behind us, clutching at the silky sari robes. If I was\
  \ about to be abducted, this didn\u2019t seem that bad. Relief bubbled over me and\
  \ I succumbed to their infectious giggles, laughing harder and harder until we were\
  \ doubled over in the streets, roaring, our hands still clutched tightly together.\
  \ Jovial tears leaked down my cheeks as I tried to express my now-irrational fears\
  \ but I was met only with excited Hindi chatter and more tittering. I wondered what\
  \ had possessed them to approach me in this manner, if my blonde hair and fair skin\
  \ was an invitation. Their intention, clearly, was simply to interact with me, an\
  \ exotic foreigner. This unexpected and unique connection filled my heart. We continued\
  \ to walk, arms swinging between us, until we reached the haven of my guesthouse.\
  \ We bid each other farewell, in the only way we knew how, with grins and bows and\
  \ a final \u2018namaste.\u2019 My smile stretched across my face like a crescent\
  \ moon as I watched them walk away, pondering the universal language of laugher\
  \ and the silliness of my \u2018sticky\u2019 situation. I climbed the steps to my\
  \ room, thanking my lucky stars I chose to come to India, a woman, alone."
