Text: "In Havana there is a sixteen story hotel. On the roof, well visible from anywhere,\
  \ there\u2019s a strange construction, the shape of which is the same as the terraces.\
  \ They say the hotel owner had a son, who died when he was sixteen, and that the\
  \ shape of the strange construction is actually a coffin, as a sort of personal\
  \ memorial.\n\nIn Havana there\u2019s an old couple, sitting on the steps in front\
  \ of a light blue door. He plays the guitar, she knocks two pieces of wood together.\
  \ They sing alternately, leaning on the door frame and intertwined with themselves,\
  \ but if you get close enough and give them a coin they\u2019ll smile back at you.\n\
  \nIn Havana there\u2019s a window with iron bars and no panes, though it\u2019s\
  \ not the only one like this. Truth be told, almost every window there is in that\
  \ way. But behind that one in particular there\u2019s a woman, dark hair and gentle\
  \ hands, who feeds a curly-headed child and wears a smile which calms anyone lucky\
  \ enough to see her.\n\nIn Havana, and more precisely in Calle Mercaderes, there\u2019\
  s a drawing that cheats on history. It\u2019s a mural created by Andres Carrillo,\
  \ who used stone powders instead of paint, colouring his world with just beige and\
  \ pink nuances. Fancy women, well dressed gentlemen and old ladies: figures belonging\
  \ to different eras who actually existed, who never met and never will, now cohabiting\
  \ on that wall.\n\nIn Havana there\u2019s a man wearing a hat. He sits on a bench,\
  \ an old brown bag in front of him. Inside the bag some straw that he calmly intertwines\
  \ creating who knows what, mumbling dirty songs.\n\nIn Havana hidden amongst the\
  \ alleys, there\u2019s a caf\xE9 with no walls. Framed with vines, full of odd vintage\
  \ armchairs and people wrapped in smoke and chatters. You can almost imagine that\
  \ at any moment one of Marquez\u2019s characters will pop out, offering you a Canchanchara\
  \ - honey, lime and of course, some a\xF1ejo rum.\n\nIn Havana there\u2019s a strange\
  \ sense of time, almost rarefied. Anything could or will happen in the space of\
  \ a \u201Cmomentito\u201D, that can last a minute or forever, it\u2019s not important.\
  \ The lack of real concern about the future is quite empowering.\n\nIn Havana everywhere\
  \ there are colours;  plenty of them, and music. A never ending background. Stray\
  \ cats sleeping, classic cars, people\u2019s smiles, as in a surreal postcard from\
  \ the past.\n\nIn Havana there\u2019s also a promise belonging to a lifetime ago,\
  \ made by a sixteen years old me who I miss sometimes. I left that promise one night\
  \ on a square\u2019s steps, while a band was playing \"son\" music and bass vibrations\
  \ were beating in my chest.\LI promised that I would never go back there. \L\nNever\
  \ again."
