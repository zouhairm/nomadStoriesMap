Text: "We were planning for masters everything was going in routine until one of my\
  \ friends pops up. Let's go Sikkim, pointing towards the North of Sikkim. Let's\
  \ go we said and the next notification I got was a message your ticket has been\
  \ confirmed.\_ \n\nWe landed in Delhi, the world's second most populous country\
  \ it seemed well defined at that moment. We took our trains, I preferred the local\
  \ cabin,\_ I wanted to meet new people, learn about their lifestyle, their language\
  \ etc.\n\n\_I got along with others they were heading towards Darjeeling, they insisted\
  \ I visit Darjeeling and try a tea. I laughed as the tea vendors kept on coming\
  \ and going in a  monotonous tone - \" Chai Lelo Chai Chai\". Their voice still\
  \ echoes in my ears but I was curious how could someone call for just a hot drink\
  \ which is available in tea bags all around the world, \nI had tried brands which\
  \ labelled they got tea leaves from Darjeeling but I didn't find anything special.\
  \ But there was something special in the way they told me.\n\nFast forward we went\
  \ and explored the North of Sikkim, the Valleys, the Mist, the dangerous curves\
  \ on the roads it felt like everything was alive, everything was living every edge\
  \ we felt the car could slip but it just gave us an adrenaline boost to go further.\n\
  \n\_We reached Zero Point a place where cars can't go beyond and to some extent\
  \ not even humans. We wanted to see snow, touch it, feel it and of course, throw\
  \ on each. It was hard as we couldn't find any snow the entire 3 days we explored\
  \ the city there but there was snow on the peak of mountains.\n\nWe decided to go\
  \ without any sort of gear or oxygen tanks at 16,000ft.\_ Half the way we could\
  \ feel the pressure and lack of oxygen obviously as I was taller than the rest I\
  \ felt it first. I went along another 300 meters but beyond that, I gave up. But\
  \ the guy who bought in the plan gave no signs of stopping he went on going until\
  \ I could see him as tiny as an ant. \n\nThere was no network we decided to go up\
  \ and call him back, In the end, we saw him come back he was out of breath, we rushed\
  \ down as he was feeling dizzy. \n\nAfter a while he said, it was an Illusion it\
  \ is water flowing from far it was still and appeared as snow. Everyone laughed\
  \ while I was thinking about tea.  \n\nEveryone agreed to go darjeeling and voil\xE0\
  \ we went, we were all tired as it was a long drive. We stopped for a while at a\
  \ small shop. There were an old lady and the best part she had Tea and we were in\
  \ Darjeeling, excited I told her I came all the way to try this tea and the story,\
  \ she gave an address and told to go there to try. \n\nWe first checked in dropped\
  \ our bags and we set off to the address hoping to grab some local food on the way,\
  \ the address belongs to none but the old lady she had freshly dried tea leaves\
  \ from her own farm with her that's why she called us yesterday as a symbol of hospitality.\
  \ It was a\_ small house but she had a big heart we fitted in anyhow\_ She put the\
  \ water to boil and then added the tea leaves. I still remember that aroma, that\
  \ smell. It was as if with every breath was energizing.\n\nI couldn't resist, finally\
  \ it came in earthen cups I drank a sip. I lost it, I could feel the entire trip\
  \ flash in front, the people who told me to try the tea in the train, the curves\
  \ and edges of the road my mind felt like it rewired. Everything seemed to be so\
  \ fresh and amazing that day I drank 3 cups as well as my friends half cup. Never\
  \ had I tasted anything so natural, so fresh.I bought her entire container of tea\
  \ powder and have it till now drinking while writing my travel story down, Slurrrp...\
  \ Aaah"
