Text: "\u201CI\u2019m getting too old for this,\u201D Lina says in a laughing tone.\
  \ \n\nWe are discussing staying up until 2 am for the blood moon, super moon, and\
  \ total lunar eclipse. She\u2019s already hungover and tired from a wedding the\
  \ night before and going out two nights prior. My husband, Jimmy, and I are just\
  \ overcoming our own hangovers and laziness from those two nights ago, too. We are\
  \ also getting too old for this. But we plan on, because that\u2019s Valparaiso.\
  \ It\u2019s also our last night before we leave for Pucon.\n\nStaying up until 2\
  \ am sounds difficult, but like all nights we\u2019ve gone out in this city \u2014\
  \ which is more alive at night than during the day \u2014 I\u2019m sure the mix\
  \ of barbecue, beer, music and friends will keep us going. Besides, what better\
  \ send off could we hope for than one listening to Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201CDark\
  \ Side of the Moon\u201D with friends during an eclipse?\n\nWhen we first met, Lina\
  \ told us about a friend who visited Valparaiso and wound up staying for 10 years.\
  \ \u201C10 years, guys! 10 years! That\u2019s Valparaiso,\u201D she said with a\
  \ shrug. She \u2014 our fun-loving host on summer break \u2014 was sure we were\
  \ going to feel the same way. \n\nWhen the first four nights of our stay ended,\
  \ we asked if we could stay just one more night. Then as we were enjoying a beer\
  \ in the brilliant summer sunshine, Jimmy brought up the idea of staying another\
  \ week instead. After all, this was the homiest place we\u2019d had for months.\
  \ Lina and her friends \u2014 Leo and Alex \u2014 were amazing. And the city was\
  \ inspiring us to chill and create. We could push back Pucon for another week.\n\
  \n\u201CJajajaja! 10 years, guys! 10 years!\u201D she reminded us with her yes.\
  \ \u201CThat\u2019s Valparaiso.\u201D\n\nOver our 12 days in Valparaiso, we did\
  \ little but experienced so much. We strolled the graffiti-strewn streets, admiring\
  \ the bright colors and beautiful art that touched almost every building. We huffed\
  \ and puffed up never-ending hills and staircases, each with its own incredible\
  \ views of the city and the port below. We ate our favorite empanadas at Empanadas\
  \ Las Famosas, stuffed with rich, soupy seafood, and washed them down with liters\
  \ of cheap beer. Then we chased down ice cream cones for dessert. \n\nJimmy strummed\
  \ his guitar in the cultural park, writing songs inspired by the people and architecture\
  \ of the city. We watched a movie at our new friend\u2019s cinema, Insomnia Alternativa\
  \ de Cine in the historic Teatro Condell building. We hopped over to Vina del Mar\
  \ to hang out on the beach and explore a new city. Amazingly, we experienced our\
  \ first earthquake \u2014 which only slowed down the city\u2019s Saturday night\
  \ parties for a couple of minutes. And we stayed up late, still brimming with energy\
  \ from the long, sunny days.\n\nLastly \u2014 and most importantly \u2014 we shared\
  \ laughs, stories, food, and beers with Lina, Leo and Alex.\n\n\u201CFor long you\
  \ live and high you fly\nAnd smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry\nAnd all you\
  \ touch and all you see \nIs all your life will ever be\u201D\n\nFor the first time,\
  \ we are quiet. After 12 days of friendly banter and laughter, there is no more\
  \ talk of music, travels, Chilean slang, or life. Instead, we are lost in our own\
  \ little pieces of this shared moment. \n\nA shadow slowly etches its way across\
  \ the moon, erasing its bright red before it goes completely dark. Gasps erupt throughout\
  \ the small backyard. A shiver runs up my spine \u2014 whether from the dark, the\
  \ cold, the perfectly-timed music, or the intensity of the moment, I do not know.\
  \ I wrap myself tighter into my blanket and enjoy every bit of it.\n\nIn one of\
  \ his songs, Jimmy asks, \u201CAre we the dreamers or the dream?\u201D To this,\
  \ I usually agree that we are the dreamers. But tonight our daydreaming minds are\
  \ still and have been overcome by the moment. We are not active dreamers. Tonight,\
  \ we are the dream. \n\nBecause that\u2019s Valparaiso."
