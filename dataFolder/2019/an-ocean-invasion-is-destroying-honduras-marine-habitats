Text: "The spear extends with a soft pffft, the sharp barb sinking through the soft,\
  \ striped flesh of the now struggling Indo-Pacific lionfish in front of me. The\
  \ tentacle-like extensions around the animal\u2019s eyes flail as the fish thrashes,\
  \ its mouth gaping to reveal a cavernous throat, ribbed like the shadowed cloisters\
  \ of a convent. The spikes extending from the animal\u2019s back lend the fish a\
  \ wild, alien appearance. It is orange and white, but appears almost grey 15m below\
  \ the surface of the Caribbean Sea. I stuff it into a bag and swim on.\n\nThe underwater\
  \ world is slow-paced, sepia-tinged, magnified. Metre-long, beaked parrotfish graze\
  \ lethargically whilst lithe-bodied wrasse dart amongst the corals. The sunlight\
  \ filters through from above, wrinkling in the ripples. My long, slow breaths fill\
  \ the soundscape. This world is serene. It is also dying.\n\nI have come to Honduras\
  \ to volunteer as a marine research assistant. Following a ten hour flight from\
  \ London to Florida, then a two hour storm-tossed plane ride from Miami, I arrived\
  \ in San Pedro Sula, the country\u2019s second largest city. The journey next involved\
  \ a cross-country drive northwards to the coast, where the mini-van had turned east\
  \ and hugged the beach-front for 305 kilometres, dropping me off at the seaside\
  \ village of Rio Esteban. A local fisherman, Javier, had secured the sea-faring\
  \ leg of the trip.\n\n\u201CThis\u201D, he had proudly told me, \u201Cis our fastest\
  \ speedboat. It will get you to Cayos in no time. Under an hour.\u201D He pointed\
  \ to the distant blue humps on the horizon, then added as an afterthought, \u201C\
  But please, be sick over the side of the boat.\u201D\n\nSeeing my disconcerted expression,\
  \ he grinned mischievously, revealing several missing teeth, and, with a frenetic\
  \ hand gesture towards the boat, said \u201CThe vomit comet!\u201D I climbed in.\n\
  \nThe speedboat was an old vessel previously used by drug traffickers, captured\
  \ by Honduran government officials and re-purposed by environmentalists to get volunteers\
  \ like myself across this bumpy stretch of sea to the idyllic island of Cayos Mejor,\
  \ the largest in the Cayos Cochinos archipelago. Despite Javier\u2019s warning,\
  \ I enjoyed the boat ride, and did not throw up. The salt spray wetted my face and\
  \ arms. The sea gleamed.\n\nOn arrival, I had bid a cheery farewell to Javier, who\
  \ bizarrely seemed disappointed by the lack of sick, and was greeted by Philippa,\
  \ a marine conservationist spending her summer on the island.\n\n\u201CGreat to\
  \ meet you! We\u2019re having lunch, then we\u2019ll head straight into the water\
  \ for your first dive \u2013 sadly, there are plenty of lionfish.\u201D\n\nA species\
  \ native to the more westerly waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, lionfish\
  \ are an unwelcome invasive species in the Caribbean. With no local predators, they\
  \ are unimpeded in their destruction of the endemic marine ecosystem. Guzzling anything\
  \ they can, lionfish are decimating the native fish population, which do not recognise\
  \ the threat. This, in turn, is damaging the Honduran economy, reliant as it is\
  \ on the fishermen\u2019s spoils.\n\n\u201CHow many did you get?\u201D Philippa\
  \ asks me, as we break the surface of the water, each clutching a bag of speared\
  \ lionfishes.\n\n\u201CThree\u201D, I reply, a little out of breath while treading\
  \ water. Philippa has two. We swim back to the boat and unload our afternoon\u2019\
  s catch.\n\n\u201CSo many,\u201D Esau, our skipper, says. He has been fishing these\
  \ waters since he was a young boy in the 1960s, and has witnessed the invasion over\
  \ his lifetime. \u201CSoon there won\u2019t be any native fish left. The lionfish\
  \ like the warmer seas.\u201D\n\nWith one in four Hondurans working in agriculture,\
  \ the country is one of the most vulnerable to climate change on the planet. As\
  \ droughts wreck farmlands in the country\u2019s interior, the seas are prey to\
  \ increased temperatures. This disrupts the delicate web of faunal interactions\
  \ the environment supports, and the underlying coral that provides the ecosystem\
  \ bedrock. If left unchecked, the far-roaming predators will eventually be left\
  \ with a depauperate, algal-dominated home, incapable of feeding the very animals\
  \ that shaped this new ocean.\n\nAs the lionfish lie limp on the deck of the boat,\
  \ one suddenly jerks, gasping for air. A last flick of the tail, and it lies still\
  \ at our feet."
