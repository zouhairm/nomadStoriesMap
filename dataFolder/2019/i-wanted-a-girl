Text: I am currently a English teacher for students with Autism, I love writing and
  reading, they are my favs! The reason I would love to travel and write is because
  of my experiences as a Air Force wife. In 2004, My husband and I were stationed
  at Ramstein AFB, We had 3 boys and I really wanted a girl... I got pregnant with
  and had the First set of Identical Triplet Girls born at Landstuhl Reginal Medical
  Center. I would love to take the girls back to their birth place, so they could
  experience the beauty of the country they were born in! While over there, serving
  2 tours, we explored so many cool things, but my girls don't remember any of it,
  my boys remember bits and pieces. Germany was a home to us for 8 years, and I think
  is such a huge part of what has become Team Cooper and our story that has lasted
  26 years thus far. I have passed my passion for reading and writing on to my 6 kids,
  they all read, write, draw and love to travel. I hope to be able to continue these
  amazing skills with them, so they can with their own kids one day. Currently 2 boys
  are script writers, and the 3 girls want to be history teachers and/or librarians.
  What amazing opportunities they could all have just by reading, writing and traveling!
