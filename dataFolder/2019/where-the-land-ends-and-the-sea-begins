Text: "I love those moments when you realize that your entire world had changed completely.\
  \ And I believe that nothing happens in vain or accidentally. \nThree years ago\
  \ I didn\u2019t even suspect of possibility of learning Portuguese but then I was\
  \ given this language at my university. And all these three difficult years, full\
  \ of tears, fatigue, loneliness and anxiety in such overcrowded city as Moscow with\
  \ its indifferent squeezed people and endless subway tracks, I have been dreaming\
  \ of going away to Portugal. \nIn my imagination this country combined tipical charming\
  \ European traits with special things: saudade, bacalhau (and yes, Portuguese really\
  \ adore this fish), Vasco de Gama, fado...\nIn reality you may wander along ancient\
  \ streets of Braga or any other city and feel that you are on a right place. This\
  \ country is soaked with history and charm.\nThree weeks after my internship had\
  \ begun I knew my heart was stolen completely.\nPortuguese people are simultaneously\
  \ polite but closed. It\u2019s not an easy job to become good friends with them,\
  \ but once you manage to find someone friendly, you\u2019ll acquire amazing people\
  \ round you!\nI love Portuguese inclination to traditions and simultaneously love\
  \ to modernism. \nI love the Atlantic Ocean and feeling of being a bird when staying\
  \ on the Cabo Gir\xE3o. \nI love its azulejo and splendid coffee.\nI love its sunny\
  \ weather in one morning and rainy in other.\nI love \u201CMadredeus\u201D.\nI love\
  \ the opportunity of having freedom.\nI love Portugal."
