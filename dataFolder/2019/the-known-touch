Text: "The pictures of Sonajhuri haat are so colourful, vibrant, full of life that\
  \ I felt almost it came alive in front of my eyes again, and Pinky will pop out\
  \ from it. I didn't know, from Mumbai to Kolkata to Shanti Niketan to Sonajhuri,\
  \ I will see the GOD. \nThick forest, loam ways, local tribes sitting on ground\
  \ with the best things they had made till date, with the hope that today they can\
  \ buy some security for few days, natives were roaming around so that they can crack\
  \ a deal for the life time, and can display their love and knowledge for the art\
  \ and handicraft. Sun down will make all leave, so all in a hurry. \nI sat at a\
  \ corner with a clay cup\u2019s tea, listening to a tribal song \u201Ctore hrid\
  \ majhe rakhbo jete dimu nah (will give you room in my heart and not let you go\
  \ ever)\u201D and watching the fair, clay dolls, cane lamps, cotton bags, hand made\
  \ accessories, handloom sarees, blouse pieces and suit pieces, boul singers and\
  \ folk dancers in between them. All were doing their bit perfectly\u2026\nI merged\
  \ into it, thinking to buy the linen saree for my beloved, that cane lamp for the\
  \ 850 sq ft drawing room, meanwhile a small hand, warm but the softness has gone\
  \ long ego, hold my pinkie finger and said, \u201Cwould you like to feed the Goddess\
  \ an ice cream\u201D \u2026 I found a 3 and half feet Goddess Kali, blue painting\
  \ all over, looking more like God Krishna\u2026 But the God himself had cleared\
  \ its identity. So, no question asked. \nWhile licking the ice cream the Goddess\
  \ became my guide for the rest of the evening, took me more inside. There I found\
  \ a puppet show, few men holding a small stage from below and few hide themselves\
  \ behind a small piece of cloth. They were holding the puppets in their hand, started\
  \ moving it as if the puppets are dancing. The Goddess forgetting her ice cream\
  \ started dancing on their tunes. I had mixed feelings; happy, excited, curious\
  \ and divine.\nThe Goddess told me next time you come, give me a call, my baba will\
  \ pick the call but drop your arrival message for me. I asked I don\u2019t know\
  \ who is Goddess Kali\u2019s dad. She laughed, laughed and laughed. Then she told\
  \ me that tell him I met Pinky in this Sonajhuri haat. \nI boarded my flight to\
  \ Mumbai, the flight about to take off. I looked out, the evening told me, same\
  \ time yesterday, Pinky took her train to her village Amodpur, a 2-hour journey\
  \ from Sonajhuri, where she lives with her brother, mother and father. I thought\
  \ about the brave parents who had to let go this 10 years old Goddess to a far fair,\
  \ where she can earn some extra for the home. \nSonajhuri haat gives fair chance\
  \ to everyone, the ones who want to sell, the ones who want to buy, the ones who\
  \ wants their own relax time, the ones who want to enjoy the cacophony. Among them\
  \ some got lucky like me, who get to meet the Gods. While leaving Pinky gave me\
  \ warm hug and asked me \u201CSo, when will you come again?\u201D. I said with little\
  \ moisture in my eyes, \u201CThe moment the Goddess wants\u201D. \nIn my bedroom,\
  \ beside my side table, I keep a small cane key ring, written Sonajhuri on it. Every\
  \ day anytime I will look at it, remembering the Goddess when her small hand gave\
  \ me this token of memory, remembering the cacophony of silence and sounds of Sobajhuri\
  \ Haat."
