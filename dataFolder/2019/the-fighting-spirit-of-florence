Text: "The afternoon of June 24th 2018 around 3:30pm, still asleep from last night\u2019\
  s wine tasting in Florence with only an hour to get to the event. Stumbling from\
  \ my bunk, I rush out the door of my hostel as I\u2019m still dressing myself and\
  \ barely brushed my hair. As soon as I get on the streets, I am bombarded by the\
  \ heart-pounding ceremony bustling throughout the artisan-filled streets of Florence.\
  \ Bands of orchestra and concussion stomp, parade the streets in radiant renaissance\
  \ attire. They strout alongside decorated knights in shining breast-plated armor\
  \ and towering stallions. My childhood fantasy story books had come to life. Alluring\
  \ jesters and jugglers entertained the local streets filled with tourists tempting\
  \ us all to follow the march onto the Santa Maria Novella\u2019s courtyard for Calcio\
  \ Storico.\n Without a map or working phone, I had to maneuver through the many\
  \ avenues, and back alleyways of Florence. I felt like a mouse within a never ending\
  \ labyrinth. I was completely lost. Overwhelmed by everything. Exhausted from the\
  \ scorching sun. It was a welcoming challenge and I loved it. Finding my way back\
  \ on the path towards the cathedral, I was embraced by the wildly passionate cheers\
  \ and drunken war-cries of the Florentine pride. It was here where I also witnessed\
  \ the athletes. These men were fierce with their presence. Their chants grew louder\
  \ with intensity, echoing, as they pounded their iron-like chest like war-drums.\
  \ At the gate, the crowd of fans aggressively shoved their way in at the same time.\
  \ Security guards punching and kicking at everyone to keep an orderly line. It was\
  \ an all out moshpit with the swarm of everyone getting claustrophobically tighter.\
  \ I was gasping for oxygen. As I slowly sunk to into the ground, the corner of my\
  \ eye spotted a dozen kids no older than 15 making their way around the gates towards\
  \ the fence. Desperately crawling my way through the fans, athletes, and guards\
  \ I catch up to the kids. One by one they jump the fence. With everyone over the\
  \ fence, one security guard notices me. All the kid disperse like ants with me being\
  \ the only one in the guards sights. At this point I thought I was done for but\
  \ for some odd miracle, the security guard he decided to let me go. I couldn\u2019\
  t believe it, I was in. I made my way to the bleachers and waited with anticipation\
  \ with thousands of Florentines. A small cannon is shot off and Calcio Storico begins.\
  \ Matches last 50 minutes and are played on a field covered in sand, with teams\
  \ that have 27 players and no substitutions are allowed for injured or expelled\
  \ players. Green team is pitted against Red team and it\u2019s the final game. Right\
  \ away, I saw the bodies of these men being tackled, jabbed, kicked. Fighting in\
  \ a wild mix of martial arts involving punching, tripping and wrestling with each\
  \ other to tire the opponent\u2019s defenses. Often descending into an all-out brawl.\
  \ Their heads being elbowed and kneed. Arms and legs strangle each other as blood\
  \ drips from the flesh wounds and onto the sand. Many players try to pin and force\
  \ into each other into submission and once there are enough incapacitated, other\
  \ teammates will rush towards the ball. From this moment on, players will try to\
  \ get the ball into the opponents' goal. The teams change sides with goal scored\
  \ as well. Punishment after relentless punishment, they get up again and again.\
  \ I join in on the rallying cry from the thousands of fan. I saw the spirits of\
  \ these men being lifted by their families, community, and people. The men embraced\
  \ the excitement and rush of it all as we all did. To win, meant honor and glory\
  \ for your neighborhood and community. I witnessed the most adrenaline-pounding\
  \ fun and action for a sport where adoring fans chant for the glory of Florence\
  \ and the athletes brutally brawl for the pride of their community. I now know,\
  \ why it is recognized as the most baddest, toughest sport on the planet. This is\
  \ Calcio Storico."
