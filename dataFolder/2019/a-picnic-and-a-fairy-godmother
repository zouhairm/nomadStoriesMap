Text: "It was not even 7 am on one fine autumn morning when I arrived at Maihama Station\
  \ alongside a wave of people, some with Disney character hats, caps and beanies\
  \ perched on their heads, heading towards one of the two Disney parks. Even though\
  \ those people were moving in a rush, I took my time taking several pictures between\
  \ the station and Disneyland\u2019s front gate. Yes, I am an adult. Yes, it was\
  \ my first trip to Disneyland, not just the one in Japan, but to any Disneyland.\
  \ Coming from a developing country in south-east Asia and not a wealthy family,\
  \ I did not have the privilege of visiting a Disney park as a child.\n\nI had been\
  \ warned that there would be queues to just enter the park which was the main reason\
  \ I went there so early in the morning. And as I was approaching the gate, I could\
  \ see short queues to ticket barriers and selling booths. Having bought my entrance\
  \ ticket at the Disney Store in Shibuya the day before, I headed towards one of\
  \ the lines to the barriers. I did pity the people queuing to buy tickets. Why,\
  \ they would have to queue twice, first to buy the ticket, then to pass through\
  \ the barrier, unnecessarily exhausting themselves even before the excitement started.\n\
  \nI found a spot behind a Japanese woman who nodded and smiled to me as she turned\
  \ around as if waiting for someone. She was around 60 years old and had a friendly\
  \ face. A family with 3 small kids claimed a spot behind me as a horde of people\
  \ flooding into all lines. Soon the lines went on as far behind as I could see.\
  \ I was wondering why there were so many school-aged kids given it was not a public\
  \ holiday in Japan when all of sudden the lines turned into a kind of picnic grounds.\
  \ People spread the ground with rugs, most with Disney characters printed on them,\
  \ and got food out of their bags. The family behind me had 2 big rugs, a thermos\
  \ and a plastic bag full of Japanese rice balls they call onigiri. Oh wow, a picnic\
  \ before the Disneyland front gate? No one had informed me of that! I certainly\
  \ would have brought my own food and old towel to sit on, had I been aware.\n\n\
  I felt a poke in my arm. It was the friendly woman before me. She had got out a\
  \ rug, which she had spread on the ground for herself, and a fleece blanket which\
  \ she offered to me. I would not have guessed her not-so-overly big bag would hold\
  \ those thick fabrics. I refused the blanket, thinking she might have wanted to\
  \ use it later. But she spread it on the ground at my feet and gestured to me to\
  \ sit down, which I did. She then shoved an onigiri and an orange into my right\
  \ hand. I refused, shoving them back into hers. She showed me a plastic bag full\
  \ of onigiris and fruits, obviously trying to convince me that she would not starve\
  \ if I took the food she had offered. I took the orange, uttering an arigato. She\
  \ smiled then her face glowed. A woman around 40 and a teenage girl just joined\
  \ her. They ate and talked and poured over the park map together. At one point,\
  \ the grand daughter stood up and left. She then came back and handed me the English\
  \ version of the map. I thanked her. Her smile was beautiful.\n\nWhen I was a child,\
  \ I dreamed of going to Disneyland, to see Cinderella\u2019s castle and maybe meet\
  \ the fairy godmother. When I finally went to Disneyland, I met a fairy godmother\
  \ even before I entered the park. I did not expect to have a picnic in front of\
  \ Disneyland and I certainly did not expect the hospitality I got. I was still scanning\
  \ my ticket when the family turned around and waved goodbye with a smile on their\
  \ faces. I waved them goodbye and returned the smile as I entered the park ready\
  \ to live a childhood dream."
