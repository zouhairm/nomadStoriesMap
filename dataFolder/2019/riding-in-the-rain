Text: "After weeks of exploring big cities, I wanted to see what small town Thailand\
  \ was like, so I headed to Pai. If the internet was right, I was either going to\
  \ love Pai or hate it. One thing was for sure - I was determined to ride a motorbike.\
  \ So on my first full day in town, I went round the corner to the motorbike shop\
  \ and handed my passport over to the mildly concerned Thai gentleman who worked\
  \ there in exchange for a bike. \n\nAnd I was off! I mean \u2026 first, I rode down\
  \ the block and around the corner and almost crashed. I wobbled unsteadily a bit,\
  \ but THEN I was off! With map in hand and a tight grip on the handlebars, I rode\
  \ all around that tiny town. I rode to Pam Bok Waterfall and swam in the clear pool\
  \ beneath the cascade. I rode to Pai Canyon and marveled at the vastness of the\
  \ mountains in the distance and the dusty, winding pathways. I rode to Tha Pai Hot\
  \ Spring and soaked in the warm water, my skin turning to prunes. Even though I\
  \ was following a well-trodden path, since it was MY first time there, it felt like\
  \ I was discovering a new world. I felt invincible. \n\nDriving the backroads of\
  \ the Thai countryside is an amazing experience. Endless rice fields, green mountains\
  \ in the distance and miles and miles of a two lane road with no one in sight. It\u2019\
  s amazing, that is, until it starts raining so hard you can\u2019t see but a few\
  \ feet in front of you. What had started as light rain early in the day had evolved\
  \ into a massive rain shower that was pounding over my shoulders and unsteadying\
  \ nerves. It was the first time I had been on a motorbike in the rain. Crashing\
  \ out here in the middle of nowhere didn\u2019t seem like a good idea. And yet there\
  \ was nowhere that I could see to stop and take shelter. I was all alone. The very\
  \ thing that had previously seemed charming and adventurous was now the thing that\
  \ was threatening my safety.\n\nThe rain was pelting my helmet and running in rivers\
  \ into my jacket and down my back. I was sopping wet. I slowed down and kept riding,\
  \ muttering prayers and sharp instructions to myself not to fall. In the distance,\
  \ I saw someone coming out of the fields holding what looked like a basket. It turned\
  \ out to be an old lady. She seemed to have been harvesting, as her basket was overflowing\
  \ with greenery. I slowed down to a stop in front of her. I stared at her. She stared\
  \ at me. We stared at each other. She looked into my panicky face with amusement\
  \ in her kind eyes. Then she put her basket down and motioned with her arms and\
  \ hands. \u201CPut on your jacket hood,\u201D she seemed to say.\n\nI reached back\
  \ and pulled the hood over my helmet and instantly the rivers down my back stopped\
  \ flowing. I wiped my fogged glasses and saw her smile gently and wave goodbye at\
  \ me. So I smiled and waved back, took a deep breath, and rode off in the rain.\
  \ \n\nSometimes that\u2019s all it takes. For someone to see you and acknowledge\
  \ that, yes, this situation you're in is bad, but you're okay. The next time you\
  \ find yourself in a rainstorm on a backcountry road, keep my old Thai lady\u2019\
  s advice on hand: cover yourself as best as you can and keep moving forward."
