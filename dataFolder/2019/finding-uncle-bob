Text: "As a young student in Paris, you think you\u2019re at the center of the world.\
  \ The streets teem with every kind of person, cultural exploration around every\
  \ corner and there is endless bustle. My parents were glad I was studying abroad,\
  \ but naturally when I had a three-week respite from classes, my mother was concerned.\
  \ She didn\u2019t like the idea of her 20-year-old only daughter traveling alone\
  \ in Paris and farther flung. Before I could send a hastily worded email entailing\
  \ all the reasons she should not come, she and my aunt were en route across the\
  \ Atlantic. I became their tour guide, ensuring they saw all the important monuments,\
  \ museums and ate as many flakey, buttery croissants as we could.  \nA few days\
  \ later, when my mother left the hotel to head home, my aunt closed the door behind\
  \ her and said,\u201D Let\u2019s find Uncle Bob.\u201D I nodded my head excitedly,\
  \ knowing exactly what she was talking about. The unspoken history surrounding my\
  \ great Uncle Robert L. Graney always piqued my interest, but was never fully satisfied.\
  \ I was always afraid to ask my grandfather about his younger brother and only learned\
  \ two things about Uncle Bob\u2019s experience during the war; he was killed in\
  \ action and was subsequently buried in France.  \n We gathered the necessary items\
  \ for our spontaneous adventure including several maps and rented a car. Without\
  \ looking at any of said maps, we began our drive out of the city. While my aunt\
  \ drove, I was tasked to decide which direction we should go. My conclusion was\
  \ to start in Normandy. From what little I could gather from my family and further\
  \ research, it was likely that Uncle Bob was not killed there, but being the resting\
  \ place of more than nine thousand American soldiers killed during World War II,\
  \ we agreed it would be a good start. \nDriving west along the A13 towards the coast,\
  \ we stopped at charming villages, ate several daring meals and ambled costal cobblestone\
  \ alleys. Without an itinerary or timeline, the trip was exciting, but the anticipation\
  \ was building the closer we drove to Colleville-sur-Mer.  \nWhen we arrived at\
  \ the Normandy American Cemetery, the mammoth horseshoe shaped colonnade rose before\
  \ us followed by what seemed like endless rows of bleach white stone grave markers.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but be in awe of the expanse of the gravesite while simultaneously\
  \ inconsolably sorrowful. Inside the visitor\u2019s center, we discovered we could\
  \ search on public computers those buried at the cemetery. Our search came back\
  \ with no results. My aunt and I began whispering frantically back and forth deciding\
  \ what to do next. Our feelings of dejection must have been evident when an employee\
  \ of the site approached us. We discussed our predicament and the short time we\
  \ had left. He simply nodded his head and walked away. That was it, I thought, we\
  \ had to continue on alone.  \nWalking through the perfect rows on an almost unseemly\
  \ sunny day, I kept thinking about how we would find Uncle Bob. As my worry grew,\
  \ a figure came running over the hill. The same gentleman from the visitor center\
  \ came handed me some paperwork. Seeing how despondent my aunt and I both were about\
  \ not being able to find Uncle Bob, he bent protocol and did a little research,\
  \ calling a few of the other cemeteries. He said that many of Uncle Bob\u2019s regiment\
  \ killed during a siege in southern France were buried in Epinal. He assured us\
  \ that that was most likely where Bob was.  \nMy aunt and I drove all night to the\
  \ other side of the country, waiting in the parking lot until the memorial opened.\
  \ Our search on the provided computers came back with a single result: Plot A Row\
  \ 18 Grave 32.  \nStanding in front of Uncle Bob\u2019s grave, I cried."
