Text: "In 2009 I watched Almodovar's movie \"Los Abrazos Rotos\" at the cinema, I\
  \ did not particularly like it and I understood around 30% of it (I still didn\u2019\
  t speak Spanish at that time), but it became a very important movie to me for two\
  \ reasons: it was the first time I went to the cinema in a city where I was living\
  \ since only few weeks, Madrid, and because it made me discover the existence of\
  \ an island from the black soil where they grow in stunning contrasting colors cactus\
  \ in bloom, palm trees, vineyards, aloe vera and houses of a blinding white, an\
  \ island full of volcanoes and breathtaking views of the Atlantic Ocean populated\
  \ by wonderful people and in which the food is amazing: Lanzarote. There are only\
  \ a few scenes shot in Lanzarote in Almodovar's film but these few scenes kept on\
  \ my mind until I could go and see with my own eyes, almost 10 years later!\n\n\
  In 2017 I visited for the first time Lanzarote, the most eastern island of the Canary\
  \ archipelago. Having a very small area I thought that a week was enough to travel\
  \ far and wide and to visit its main attractions: I was wrong, I have already returned\
  \ 3 times and I have not finished yet to see everything I have planned to, in this\
  \ island the nature is marvelous: from the coast to the hinterland, every place\
  \ offers different and beautiful panoramic views, then there are the white villages\
  \ with green and blue windows with their kind inhabitants. In Lanzarote you get\
  \ immediately the impression of be inside local life.\n\nAnother source of extreme\
  \ interest, a discovery I made on the spot that has enriched my life is one of the\
  \ most important personalities of the island: Cesar Manrique: A 360-degree artist\
  \ that fought to keep the soul of his land. In the 70s, in fact, the huge tourist\
  \ boom that came after the opening of the tourist airports on these islands (so\
  \ difficult to be reached before) has brought a wave of investments in the sector\
  \ that have often left aside the respect for nature and local culture; for this\
  \ reason today the main islands of the archipelago have been badly ruined by the\
  \ invasions of unconscientious tourists and by the absence of rules that would protect\
  \ them.\nManrique fought to approve urban planning laws that preserved his island\
  \ from being razed to the ground and rebuilt according to the comfort of foreign\
  \ tourists. The central north part of the island has been saved thanks to these\
  \ battles; the south unfortunately not. (happily there is a large protected natural\
  \ park in the south-eastern part where building is forbidden).\n\nManrique did not\
  \ limit himself to fighting for laws that preserve his territory but he started\
  \ to devise cultural attractions that show how a sustainable tourism that enhances\
  \ the nature and local culture is possible and is the winning solution. He created\
  \ the Mirador del Rio: a panoramic view point built into the rock (which can not\
  \ be seen from the outside and does not ruin the glance on these mountains accessible\
  \ from the beautiful beach of Famara). From outside we do not notice almost his\
  \ presence but once inside we find ourselves in front of an unforgettable show:\
  \ a unique view on the most northern tip of the island and on the small island in\
  \ front, the \u201CGraciosa\u201D.\n\nWith the same philosophy of continuity between\
  \ internal and external spaces and respecting local traditions we find Manrique\u2019\
  s monuments and attractions scattered around the island, the natural caves of the\
  \ \u201CJameo del Agua\u201D and \u201CCueva de los Verdes\u201D, the incredible\
  \ natural park of the volcanoes (\u201CTimanfaya\u201D), the \u201CCactus Garden\u201D\
  , his two houses/museum, the \u201Cmonument to the Campesino\u201D and so on. \n\
  \nMaybe it is the natural conformation so special and different from the landscapes\
  \  we are used to, maybe it\u2019s the strength of the ocean and of the inhabitants\
  \ of these white villages, maybe it\u2019s the energy and the artistic inspiration\
  \ of Cesar Manrique but Lanzarote is an \"avis rare\" in which you never get tired\
  \ of coming back.\n\nThanks to Pedro Almodovar for letting me discover it!"
