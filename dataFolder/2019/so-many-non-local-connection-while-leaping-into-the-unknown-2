Text: "For a long time I\u2019ve been balancing between regular life full of earthbound\
  \ responsibilities and dream life which is travel itself. \nIn general, my previous\
  \ trips were great but always limited to the vacation plan agreed with employeers.\
  \ This time is different as I quit my job and left everything, which could distract\
  \ me, behind. It\u2019s been 3 months now, since I\u2019m in Asia, roaming around\
  \ here and there. The fixed plan or final destination doesn't exist - pure journey\
  \ is my goal.  All of this to \u201Cbe here now\u201D completely. \n\nDuring my\
  \ trip, I\u2019ve finally had the time to do all of the things that I normally put\
  \ away for \u201Ctomorrow\u201D. All of visited places, all people met on my way\
  \ and all of magical moments enriched my soul and mind.  I\u2019ve also got acquintanced\
  \ with extremely exciting and sometimes a bit scary \u201Cunknown\u201D.  I can\
  \ now see and feel more then ever in my whole lifetime because I simply don\u2019\
  t hesitate to stop for a longer moment whenever I find something interesting.\n\n\
  All of things mentioned above were what I expected but there was one thing I didn\u2019\
  t expect while leaping into unknown - 80 percent of people that I\u2019ve met and\
  \ spent extra time with were poles - my countrymen\u2019s. Maybe it was just a bunch\
  \ of coincidences. I\u2019ll never know but it has helped me to understand that\
  \ poles are a great travellers and very open minded fellows. The funniest and common\
  \ thing about our conveversation was that we were surprised with the amount of people\
  \ having the similar needs and dreams. It appeard that all of them decided to have\
  \ a longer break from ordinary life in Poland. Not because something is wrong with\
  \ our country. Quite the contrary, living in Poland is good and peaceful enough\
  \ to think about something more than just earning money to make a leaving and have\
  \ a 1 or 2 weeks vacation a year willing to buy an appartment or build a house to\
  \ spend there the rest of their lifes. I need to admit, I was surprised that most\
  \ of my new connections were non local ones so far. As much as I love meeting people\
  \ from all over the word, I\u2019m proud to find out that I there are so many positive,\
  \ open minded and curious poles, all over the world.\n\nThis is my last story with\
  \ a very positive vibe."
