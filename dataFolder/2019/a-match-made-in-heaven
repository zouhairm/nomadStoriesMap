Text: "\u201CSis, your pants are falling apart,\u201D my sister pointed at the side\
  \ of my left hip.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t joking. The side seams holding the zipper were\
  \ unraveling.\n\nI panicked. We were in Dadaocheng, Taipei\u2019s century-old port\
  \ town. \n\n\u201CI think I know where to go,\u201D my sister led the way.\n\nI\
  \ clutched the opening and my sister grabbed our boba milk tea tight. As we were\
  \ pacing down the rows of red brick building decorated with red lanterns, we see\
  \ a group of locals heading to the Xiahai Temple. This small temple wafting the\
  \ town with its scent of incense was filled with fresh fruit and flowers offered\
  \ by those who prayed for love. Indeed, this city monument was known for answering\
  \ the wishes and prayers on finding love. And I was in desperate need of my love,\
  \ a seamstress.\n\n\u201CThis way!\u201D My sister made a quick turn on her left.\n\
  \nShe took me to a rather worn down two-story mall. Inside were random disarrays\
  \ of small shops, from fruit stands showcasing colorful tropical fruits to a snack\
  \ bar where people came for a quite bite of some fish cakes and noodles. At the\
  \ end of the hallway was a small alteration shop with fabric rolls leaning on the\
  \ wall and bits of fabric pieces lying on the floor. The shop was disorganized but\
  \ not filthy. Every inch of chaos in this room had its order. Behind the glass door,\
  \ a lady sat in front of a white Domestic sewing machine. Could she be my match\
  \ made in heaven?\n\n\u201CWhat are you waiting for? Go!\u201D \n\nIn spite of my\
  \ matchmaker\u2019s haste, I stood in a distance to think of how to begin a conversation,\
  \ as first-impression always matters. Should I begin by asking for the price? And\
  \ how would I be covering myself when she has my pants? But much like falling in\
  \ love, one must take a leap of faith.\n\nI approached the shop and sent her the\
  \ most loving gaze I could have. A woman in her early-50s with bop hair turned her\
  \ head and smiled at me. I was instantly in love with her. I smiled back awkwardly\
  \ and showed her my problem. She took her glasses with strings attached on the side,\
  \ like the ones my aunt used to wear, to take a closer look. I widened my eyes and\
  \ asked, \u201Cok?\u201D to ask for her approval. She stood valiantly and nodded.\
  \ \n\nNow I wanted to ask her, \u201Cdo I undress here?\u201D But, of course the\
  \ lists of Chinese vocabularies I knew had nothing close to that. So I pointed downwards\
  \ then I gestured for pulling my pants down as I whispered, \u201Chere, pants down?\u201D\
  \ She looked confused for a second.\n\nShe gently pulled the full-length brown curtain\
  \ on the opposite side of her working station and magically created a small section\
  \ for a quick change, my own pumpkin carriage. I stepped behind the full-length\
  \ curtain in a 30 square feet shop and pulled my pants down. I peaked my head out\
  \ of the curtain as if I\u2019m some character from Cabaret and found the master\
  \ already sitting by her machine ready to stitch away. I handed her my pants like\
  \ it was my precious firstborn, but unlike some unfortunate fairytales, I had faith\
  \ in my sorcerer. She began by taking the entire pants apart, yet I kept my faith\
  \ strong, as I know good things happen to those who believe. Soon she took black\
  \ threads into the end of the machine and began the most rhythmical work. \n\nLess\
  \ than five minutes later, she finished the stitching and began ironing the pants.\
  \ And she turned around to show me her fine piece of work. I smiled and said xiexie\
  \ and I tried it back on. It felt so natural as if it all of it never happened.\n\
  \n\u201CBibidi bobidi boo! Cinderella,\u201D said my sister.\n\nI dramatically drew\
  \ the curtain and came out as a new person. I thanked my savior once more and left\
  \ the shop.\n\n\u201CWhere should we go next?\u201D my sister asked. \n\n\u201C\
  Back to the temple. I have to say my thanks.\u201D"
