Text: "We\u2019re here. The island is conquested by astonishingly enormous, spiky,\
  \ pale plants that create barricades, blessed with a dangerous, exotic appearance.\
  \ \n\nThe charm of the island isn\u2019t like the one of the Blue Caves we saw today.\
  \ \nThat was something that gave light to the heart, magnifying that natural magic.\
  \ The cave was filled with salty, pure, liquid beauty that emerged from the lonely\
  \ depth carved into the Earth\u2019s surface. I  submerged to admire the restless\
  \ grace of the sea. I always found the way out, where the sun penetrated into that\
  \ secret, and kindly embracing home of million shades of blue. This has something\
  \ more to add...something to tell.\nThe fear that causes, isn\u2019t like jumping\
  \ down from the height of a wild rock, earlier on this trip. \nThere I didn\u2019\
  t want to think about the landing, about the altitude I needed to close in by falling\
  \ helplessly into the foreign, aquatic world. This doesn\u2019t seem to be so vivid,\
  \ still it\u2019s scary in its peacefulness.\n\nMy look lost on the heavy, weary\
  \ building in the focus of the island. I cannot help, my head is aching from the\
  \ ruthless sun, but I have the urgent temptation to discover the some way alarming\
  \ mystery of Fort Mamula. \nMy class was told that this edifice was once a concentration\
  \ camp, where prisoners were trapped who knows in what circumstances...The information\
  \ takes away a little part of the pulchritude of the place. Magnificent, indifferent\
  \ bricks pulled together to form rigid prison cells decorated with grated windows\
  \ which seem perfectly indestructible. I\u2019m sure: the liberty and richness of\
  \ thoughts couldn\u2019t be limited by these walls. And at least here I find an\
  \ escape from the powerful sunray. \n\nWe\u2019re travelling together, but the new\
  \ environment around me awakens new paths inside me, opening an uncontrolled trip.\
  \ I see a different side of me, as I would be travelling through my emotions: amusement,\
  \ worry, wonder, persistent awareness, and unavoidable faith in the only important\
  \ discovery of the mind (as I cannot untangle more from my blind confusion of excitement),\
  \ which suggests: \u201Cthis is the place where I have to be right now\u201D. I\
  \ stick to this familiar thought, since it makes me feel secure.\n\nThe huge construction\
  \ of stone covers the majority of the island. In the middle of the round court there\u2019\
  s a deep and dark pump which once could strangle the disappointments, anger, grief\
  \ and sadness of the prisoners. My classmates, enjoying themselves on an imposing\
  \ caracole, don\u2019t pay much attention to the hole but it makes my blood tremble\
  \ of frightened fantasy. How tortured people could walk on these same steps, not\
  \ cheerfully amazed at the unique experience, but deeply suffering.\n\nThe past\
  \ of this island couldn\u2019t be compensated by the wonderful mix of wilderness\
  \ and the unbreakable stability. I\u2019m walking without pause. I get nervous,\
  \ anxious to see somebody. Anybody. My way is blocked by the plant jungle, I cannot\
  \ pass. I can hear calls for embarking. I know the ship wouldn\u2019t go away without\
  \ me, therefore I don\u2019t need to be so afraid. I feel lost, although I believe\
  \ I was just wandering around the prison complex. Finally I recognize one of my\
  \ friends above, on the exit bridge. I just have to find the way back there...She\
  \ disappears in the bright distance. \n\nSummer forces me to cheer up when I can\
  \ eventually join the rest of the class. I don\u2019t tell my fears to anyone. That\
  \ island and its infinite paths wanted to swallow me, wanted to make me stay, to\
  \ hug me strongly, devour me completely. I didn\u2019t want to see more of that\
  \ gorgeous and terrific piece of land. A glance from the safe shipboard would have\
  \ done as well. But I know I couldn\u2019t fight with my curiosity. \nI collect\
  \ images like a film roll intending to preserve them, and as an instrument, that\u2019\
  s able to decode a melody in order to reproduce, to paint it later, interpreting\
  \ in a really personal way. \n\nMy ship inside me is moving slowly, sometimes it\
  \ runs out of air, starts to sink, or gets into storm. But it floats. It always\
  \ does!"
