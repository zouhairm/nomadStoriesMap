Text: "When I was 12 years old I had a school project. My school project was a deep\
  \ research into global inequalities. \nI chose education, and my mission by the\
  \ end of the process was to collect a box full of stationary and books to deliver\
  \ to an orphanage in India during a family trip. We left Australia with almost no\
  \ clothes, making room for the box in our luggage.\n\nThis large cardboard box travelled\
  \ with us, a family of 5, and became so many more things. \n\nIt journeyed with\
  \ us from east to west, and west to east on overnight trains. \nIt became our games\
  \ table, with hundreds of competitive card games played while waiting for buses\
  \ on it. \nIt sat patiently while we ate our meals. \n\nAlong the way, the box almost\
  \ got left behind. My mum would say \u201CI think it would be okay if we left it\
  \ here.\u201D And I would refuse, insisting we would know the orphanage when we\
  \ got there. \n\n3 weeks into the trip, we got to Kerala. We were staying for 1\
  \ night in what is best described as a concrete bunker. There were no windows, but\
  \ luckily fly screens. The staff lived in a shack on thin and wobbly stilts and\
  \ there were 3 other travelers staying with us. \n\nIn the middle of the night,\
  \ the winds picked up and the rain plummeted down. A cyclone had hit Kerala. A vicious\
  \ and unforgiving cyclone. \n\nMy mother was nursing my little sister back to health.\
  \ \nMy dad, who has never stressed a moment in his life stormed into her room, rambling\
  \ about how we have to order the taxi to come now, how we weren\u2019t going to\
  \ make it to the train the next day and we had to go! \nMy mum, who stresses about\
  \ a lot of things a lot of the time, was the calmest she\u2019s ever been. She said,\
  \ \u201CLeon, don\u2019t be ridiculous. Go to bed.\u201D \n\nJust an hour later,\
  \ the roles had reversed. My mum came in the room that my dad and I were sharing.\
  \ (She always tells this part smiling). She kicked my dad so as not to wake me,\
  \ dragged him out of the room and said \u201CLeon! I\u2019m stressing!\u201D And\
  \ as if planned my dad replied \u201CNay, don\u2019t be ridiculous. Go to sleep!\u201D\
  \ \nAll night my mother sang and prayed that we would all be okay. \nAll the while\
  \ I slept without a sound. \nMy brother tells me how in the middle of the night\
  \ he was dragged out of his bed so the women staying in the swaying shack on stilts\
  \ could have a secure room. \n\nThe box. Oblivious to the raging storm outside,\
  \ just sat in the corner of my room. \n\nThe next morning, when the storm subsided,\
  \ my dad and brother ventured out and returned with a big, blue tarp. The local\
  \ houses were ruined, and trees had fallen everywhere. \nMy dad returned to our\
  \ bunkers welcome us all into his \u201Cfitting room\u201D, styling us with the\
  \ most fashionable tarp ponchos you\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nAfter suiting up all\
  \ 9 of us, he of course made one for the box. \n\nThis was the closest we got to\
  \ saying goodbye to the box. But we had gotten so far with it. And my mission was\
  \ not yet over. \n\nWe proceeded to hail down a potato truck and pile in with our\
  \ bags, our ponchos and our much loved box. We arrived at the train station having\
  \ missed our train, rerouting our trip to the bus station, with 36 hours of overnight\
  \ bussing ahead of us. \n\nThis is when the box became the resting place of my still\
  \ younger sister after hours of nauseatingly sick little sister. \n\nA few nights\
  \ later we rocked up at an orphanage and were welcomed so beautifully by 50 children\
  \ with the most heartbreaking stories. Without any notice of us coming, they all\
  \ came into the hall and sang songs and danced for us. \n\nThey smiled with absolute\
  \ delight at the pencils we handed out to them, truly astounded by the joy of such\
  \ a simple thing. A gift. \nThat\u2019s when finally, we parted with the box."
