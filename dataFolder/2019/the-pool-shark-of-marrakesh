Text: "Were the cats in cahoots? This and other absurd thoughts crowded my head as\
  \ I squeezed through the narrow streets of Marrakech\u2019s Medina, sweat beginning\
  \ to cloud my contacts. Men helpfully called out strategies for dodging motorbikes.\
  \ Eyeing a chubby tabby staring me down, I tried to figure out if this was the same\
  \ corner I\u2019d rounded five minutes earlier. But, unless the cats were darting\
  \ past me to quickly switch positions, this was definitely a different cat and a\
  \ different corner. \n\nNo doubt countless travel guides that I hadn\u2019t had\
  \ time to read recommended meandering aimlessly through this regal, walled-off city.\
  \ With no Wi-Fi and an abysmal sense of direction, I was reduced to relying on stray\
  \ cats for navigation.\n\nI came to Morocco for a work trip to Casablanca. With\
  \ a brutal schedule ahead of the trip, I hadn\u2019t had time to do my usual obsessive\
  \ research. I wanted to spend a few days exploring on my own and picked Marrakesh\
  \ based on proximity and word-of-mouth. I had showed up to the train with three\
  \ misshapen bags filled with business casual and multiple pairs of shoes. I would,\
  \ of course, wear the same pair of shoes every day of my trip. A fact I reminded\
  \ myself of as a stranger triple my age jumped up to help me handle the baggage.\
  \ I had been warned countless times by family, friends and strangers that women\
  \ should not travel alone. It turned out, in Morocco, I was never really alone.\
  \ \n\nAfter using a byzantine process of elimination, I eventually found the correct\
  \ street and my hostel. The hostel was meant to echo one of Marrakesh\u2019s supple\
  \ riads, complete with a courtyard fragrant with flowers, an intricately tiled pool,\
  \ and an authentic lack of Wi-Fi. Once I\u2019d devoured yet another incredible\
  \ lamb tagine, I headed out to the one place I\u2019d been able to look up before\
  \ the Wi-Fi flickered out: La Maison de la Photographie. \n\nAlthough I\u2019d marked\
  \ the museum on a map, I found myself outside the walls of the Medina after an hour\
  \ of stumbling around the city. My dejection was clearly evident because a young\
  \ Moroccan stopped me and started rapidly talking at me in French. I smiled and\
  \ mouthed the words many Americans before me had no doubt uttered: \u201Csorry,\
  \ I don\u2019t speak French.\u201D \u201CArabic?\u201D she replied. Embarrassed,\
  \ I answered \u201Cvery little.\u201D \n\n\u201CI\u2019m very sorry, my English\
  \ is terrible,\u201D she said, in flawless English. She asked if I needed help and\
  \ I admitted I was lost. \u201CI\u2019m just here visiting from Fes, but I\u2019\
  ll ask him,\u201D she said, gesturing toward an officer directing traffic. She proceeded\
  \ to stop three locals, all working together to figure out directions to the museum.\
  \ After thanking her profusely, the woman smiled and said, \u201Cyou\u2019re welcome\
  \ to Morocco,\u201D and headed off on her own adventure. \n\nVines snaked around\
  \ the airy museum. A repository of Moroccan photography, I was drawn to one black\
  \ and white photograph from the 1930s. It pictured a young Moroccan woman with elegant\
  \ finger-waves perched deliberately on a pool table, lining up a shot. She seemed\
  \ set apart from the two suited up men in the photo, one frowning at her and the\
  \ other seemingly evaluating her pool skills. Not only defying expectations, she\
  \ seemed to be ignoring them. There was little context accompanying the photo save\
  \ for her name, Yassmina, but I couldn\u2019t help but project my own experience\
  \ onto the image, filling in the blanks and feeling connected to this woman from\
  \ generations ago. \n\nEmpowered by my solo trip around Marrakech and cradling a\
  \ copy of Yassmina\u2019s portrait, I boarded another packed train to Casablanca.\
  \ I nearly missed my stop due to my promiscuous packing making it hard to navigate\
  \ the crowd. A man who had shared his snacks with me on the ride managed to galvanize\
  \ the whole train car into operation: Get the Clueless Tourist off the Train. Forming\
  \ an assembly line to throw my luggage onto the platform, two men jumped out to\
  \ catch me. As the train pulled away, the car broke into applause as I stood laughing\
  \ at the station. Feeling both idiotic and happier than I\u2019d ever been."
