Text: "The year 2017 will always be an unforgettable year for me. That was the year\
  \ when I finally had the courage to invest my money into traveling. I went solo\
  \ traveling for a month and I got to visit Bali mainland, Nusa Lembongan, Nusa Ceningan,\
  \ Nusa Penida, Gili Islands (Trawangan, Air, and Meno), and Lombok mainland. This\
  \ travel story will tell you about my experience in Nusa Penida, Bali.\n\nI stayed\
  \ in a transient house that I booked through booking.com and I wish I had stayed\
  \ longer than 2 nights. I didn\u2019t really gather the information about the best-staying\
  \ area so I ended up in a bad location accommodation in the hill, surrounded by\
  \ jungle. I needed at least to drive 30 minutes to get to the main road in the coastal\
  \ area, where the downtown was located. The internet was also bad, their wi-fi sucked\
  \ and I didn\u2019t get any signal there then I found out that I only could get\
  \ signal in the coastal area of Nusa Penida.\n\nI found a travel partner in Bali\
  \ mainland that went to Nusa Penida with me. We arrived in Nusa Penida around 10\
  \ AM and we went straight to the booked accommodation. We rented a scooter then\
  \ we headed out to the main road to get foods. We chose a small restaurant that\
  \ seemed decent foods and view of the Nusa Penida coast. While I had 4G internet\
  \ connection, I gathered the information about Nusa Penida tourism places. I pinned\
  \ each place with \u201CWant to go\u201D pin in my Google Maps. We decided to go\
  \ to Rumah Pohon Melonteng (Melonteng Treehouse) then Atuh Beach because both were\
  \ located on the east side. We saved the west side of Nusa Penida for the next day.\n\
  \nRumah Pohon Melonteng was the area of treehouses that were up for rental and tourism\
  \ spot. The parking fee and the entrance fee were not expensive, about $3 in total.\
  \ Going in, you\u2019d already been able to see the treehouses from a distance along\
  \ with the stunning ocean view. I hiked down to the treehouses in the risky and\
  \ slippery path which only protected with the rope that was supposed to act as the\
  \ fence. We made a huge mistake by wearing flip flops since we didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to do some hiking. After reaching the treehouse area, we went up to the highest\
  \ point where you would be able to chill in the traditional hut. The golden hour\
  \ we enjoyed couldn\u2019t get any better. Time passed, we realized that we were\
  \ supposed to go back to our accommodation before dark. We canceled our intention\
  \ to go to Atuh Beach even though it seemed close to the Rumah Pohon Melonteng.\n\
  \nThe next day we wanted to go to Peguyangan Waterfall but we ended up in Guyangan\
  \ Water Springs since we got confused about the name similarity. We didn\u2019t\
  \ regret going there since we were able to get into more adventure by going down\
  \ hundreds of cliffside stairs just to get to the water springs, some stairs were\
  \ even made from fragile woods. Yet, we loved it because of the killer cliffside\
  \ view. We continued to Kelingking Beach but due to our schedule, we didn\u2019\
  t go down to the Kelingking beach and only enjoyed the magnificent view from above.\
  \ Lastly, we went to the beautiful Angel\u2019s Billabong (a tide pool) and Broken\
  \ Beach which was an arch where the ocean wave came in into the hidden beach.\n\n\
  The main roads in Nusa Penida are paved but as you were closer to the tourism area,\
  \ the roads turned to be unpaved and very challenging to drive on. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find joy in this imperfect yet amazing island. The views here are the\
  \ ones I had never seen in other places. I also learned a new skill to navigate\
  \ offline using Google Maps because of the bad internet signal. I found the adventure\
  \ I was seeking here through the harsh roads and risky paths that could get you\
  \ falling into the ocean with one wrong step. That is why amongst all the destinations\
  \ I visited, Nusa Penida still owns my heart."
