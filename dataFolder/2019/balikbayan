  \nFor days, my siblings and I told our parents they were bringing too much with\
  \ them to the Philippines. Suitcases overflowed with Ferrero Rochers and perfumes,\
  \ duffle bags were stuffed with old clothes, and a Balikbayan box was filled with\
  \ water bottles, purses and anything we hadn\u2019t touched in years. \n\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s pasalubong - gifts for your relatives! You\u2019re lucky here in Australia,\u201D\
  \ my mother would exclaim before storming off in a Filipino rant to find more items\
  \ to pack.\n\nOver the years, rather than throwing away or donating our things,\
  \ my parents always made it a point to hang onto them, even though it would litter\
  \ the house and constantly frustrate my siblings and I. Why our relatives would\
  \ want a Bambi thermos was beyond me.\n\n--- \n\nThe last time I travelled to the\
  \ Philippines, I was a chubby twelve-year old with the standard adolescent issues\
  \ - puberty, starting high-school, boys\u2026\n\nMy few memories of that trip are\
  \ simply blurs of faces, mountains and traffic. I remember flashes of my Tito\u2019\
  s house with its rusted, blue gate and braiding my younger cousin\u2019s hair as\
  \ we sat on her parents\u2019 bed, escaping the outside Manila heat. The Philippines\
  \ is famous for its beaches but I have no memories of visiting any even though my\
  \ parents constantly remind me that we did.\n\nDespite my family regularly travelling\
  \ there, I always stayed behind in Australia with excuses that now seem insignificant\
  \ - university, work, having the house to myself finally - but this year, I decided\
  \ it was time to go back.\n\nAs I sat on the Cebu Pacific plane, gazing out at the\
  \ lush tropic greenery below me, I felt my body shiver and a thought appeared.\n\
  \nWhat if I forget everything again? \n\n---\n\n\nOne Tuesday morning, we all piled\
  \ into a battered white van with the Balikbayan box stowed in the back and headed\
  \ towards Taguig, the city that my grandmother, Lola Muning, lived in. She too was\
  \ a memory - a small, bony lady with a raspy voice and soft, white curls that framed\
  \ her thin face.\n\nAs we travelled through the crowded streets, the familiar skyscrapers\
  \ in Bonifacio Global City disappeared, replaced by crumbling houses with dusty\
  \ facades. Paint wore thin, signs were no longer legible and the smell of burnt\
  \ rubber lingered in the air. Pale pink bunting popped across balconies and poles,\
  \ a reminder of the Sainto Nino festival that had recently taken place. People loitered\
  \ the road without a care for the incoming traffic and those who lazed in alleyways,\
  \ asleep on plastic chairs took no notice of the Australians entering their city.\
  \ \n\nThe streets grew narrower in Taguig and as we drove over the stones, we finally\
  \ stopped in front of a fruit vendor, the area completely foreign to me. Yet, as\
  \ we got out of the van, my family instantly headed down an alleyway framed by brick\
  \ on one side and a wiry, metal gate on the other. \n\nTurning the corner, we stood\
  \ in front of a tiny house with open windows, nestled next to identical others.\
  \ Plants of all shapes and sizes lined the outside and across was a once-vibrant\
  \ turquoise wall that too had met its match in a dust storm. \n\nThe door was left\
  \ slightly ajar and through the crack, I could see a figure standing by the dining\
  \ room table, her loose blue dressing gown moving slightly in the breeze.\n\nMy\
  \ mother knocked excitedly on the door and pushed it open, shouting \u201CWe\u2019\
  re here!\u201D much to the surprise of my grandmother who gasped at the family intruding\
  \ her home.\n\n\u201CDJ?\u201D she said to me, looking up through her glasses. I\
  \ shook my head, not even the slightest annoyed that she had mistook me for my sister.\
  \ Instead I was speechless, as sitting on a cabinet shelf behind the kitchen table,\
  \ was an item I had not expected to see. Even behind the glass, I still recognised\
  \ the Disney deer staring back at me, the thermos I had forgotten about for years.\
  \ \n\n\u201CIkaw ay bumalik?\u201D my Lola said to me as we settled on the couch,\
  \ her hands intertwined with mine. \n\nYes, Lola. I have returned."
