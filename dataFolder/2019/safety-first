Text: "\u201CHurry up!\u201D shouted the crew. \u201CThe boat will depart soon,\u201D\
  \ he added. I started to run faster. I couldn\u2019t be left behind on this island\
  \ since the next boat would be due to depart for Jakarta the next morning.  \nI\
  \ boarded the boat easily this time. Unlike the first time from Muara Angke port\
  \ in Jakarta, the boat was apparently docked rather far from the pier. I remembered,\
  \ with a ticket in my hand, I tagged along with the other passengers to board a\
  \ motorboat heading to one of Jakarta\u2019s Thousand Islands, mine heading to Harapan\
  \ Island. We had to jump over one boat after another to reach the right one. This\
  \ was rather terrifying as the boats were wet and slippery. Any misstep, and you\
  \ plunged into the sea.\nIt was a two-level traditional motorboat accommodating\
  \ around 180 passengers. We could choose to stay in the (much hotter) room below\
  \ with seats or the room above with no seats \u2013 you could sit with your legs\
  \ stretched and even lie down here. \nAs I looked for a place to sit, I gathered\
  \ that there was no room left for me. This boat was quite packed!\n\u201CWhere should\
  \ I sit?\u201D I muttered. The only vacant space was the promenade deck on the right\
  \ sight of the boat. It was a small space fit for one person to walk by or just\
  \ stand up with a railing to lean on. I knew it was dangerous and must be deemed\
  \ illegal for the crew to let so many people on this boat, let alone sit there.\
  \ But there was no choice other than sitting along that deck. \nWalking from the\
  \ main deck, I started my way to that spot. As I passed the entrance into the second-floor\
  \ passenger room, I saw some life jackets piled up in a mess. Apparently, some passengers\
  \ did not see fit to wear them. It seemed that the crews also did not encourage\
  \ them to wear one.   \nI grabbed a rather worn jacket and proceeded to sit along\
  \ the promenade deck with the other unfortunate passengers. Donning the jacket,\
  \ I sat and leaned on the wooden wall below the window, knees folded. If I stretched\
  \ my feet under the railing, they would dangle. \nThe boat started to move and glide\
  \ through the water, leaving Harapan Island behind, its white sandy beach, the turquoise\
  \ sea water, the delicious squid stick, and all the beauty and adventures it offered.\n\
  \u201CThis boat is overloaded,\u201D someone to my left side exclaimed. \u201CRather\
  \ packed, isn\u2019t it?\u201D I added. \u201CYes. You know, earlier this year,\
  \ there was a motorboat accident. The boat was on fire and overloaded.\u201D She\
  \ rejoined. I must have missed the news. \n\u201CThe reported record stated that\
  \ they were transporting 100 passengers, but in fact, there were more than twice\
  \ the number, 230 to be exact.  Because of that, the number of life jacket was not\
  \ even and some people didn\u2019t get those. When the fire started to spread and\
  \ the boat was sinking, people jumped into the sea even without wearing the jacket.\
  \ That\u2019s maybe why some people died and were missing.\u201D She continued.\
  \ \nIt was indeed a tragedy that could have been avoided. If only the boat had had\
  \ a sufficient number of life jackets. If only the crew had handled the evacuation\
  \ well. Safety, that should be the first thing that came to mind. They had to consider\
  \ their safety first before embarking on this sea voyage.      \nAs far as the eye\
  \ can see, the water was so blue. We were in the middle of the sea with no land\
  \ in sight. Clutching my jacket, I mulled this over. I began to muse on the possibility\
  \ of any mishap befalling us on this journey. With the scorching heat of the sunshine\
  \ directly on my side of the boat, I bowed my head on my knees and hoped that we\
  \ would make it home safe and sound."
