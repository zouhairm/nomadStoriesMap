Text: "I had no expectation of what visiting a monastery in northern India might be\
  \ like. The white-washed squares in the distance were stacked like an uneasy sandcastle,\
  \ haphazardly perched on the mountainside. As I got closer, this hodgepodge of structures\
  \ appeared both ancient and contemporary, the fresh, newly painted buildings propping\
  \ up the aged and infirm. \n\nHeavily adorned with colourful prayer flags, the familiar\
  \ Himalayan archway stood tall and sure at the entrance to the complex. I removed\
  \ my shoes and began climbing the steep stone steps that led into the oldest part\
  \ of the monastery. On entering, I was immediately transported: the soft well-trodden\
  \ stone floor, the smooth mud-packed walls and frayed oriental rugs reminiscent\
  \ of a time long past. \n\nWinding my way through the cold, pale interior I found\
  \ myself in the presence of a young, red-robed monk, perched on a simple wooden\
  \ chair. Gently rolling a string of prayer beads the colour of burnt orange in his\
  \ fingers, he was staring into the distance, peaceful and undisturbed in his expression.\
  \ 'Do you live here alone?' I asked.\n'Yes, but we monks take it in turns to stay\
  \ here. I will be here for two years'' he replied.\n\n'And then where will you go?'\
  \ I was intrigued by this solitary existence. \n'I will go to another monastery,\
  \ just up the hill', he explained, adjusting the thin framed glasses resting on\
  \ his nose, 'but I will never leave this area. I will stay here in Dhankar Gompa\
  \ my entire life'. He began to hum a delicate Buddhist mantra as I was left to ponder;\
  \ to live in such a remote part of the world was a testament to his pious and dutiful\
  \ character. \n\nEvery turn in this white labyrinth breathed new possibility. In\
  \ a dark corridor that burrowed deep into the building\u2019s stone core, I found\
  \ a small wooden door with 'Prayer Cave' marked on a plaque above it. I ducked inside.\
  \ The air was thick and heavy; I felt the weight of the past, the visceral smell\
  \ of devotion. It was a complex feeling that I did not linger on, not for a lack\
  \ of wanting but for a lack of time. \n\nWeaving back up the rabbit hole, I found\
  \ a narrow opening that had been carved into the solid stone exterior wall one thousand\
  \ years before, presenting the deep blue sky of the outside world. I clambered through\
  \ the gap. From the small ledge the valley burst open beneath my feet, revealing\
  \ the colossal expanse and the snaking river far below.\n\nThe mountains rising\
  \ high above me, encompassing the monastery and myself like the sides of a vast\
  \ solid bathtub, cradling the world that lay within its rugged, reassuring walls.\
  \ Bare feet pressed firmly on the cold rough stone, I crept closer to the edge,\
  \ my gaze engulfed by the spectacular view nature had provided me.\n\nSuddenly,\
  \ the thought of spending a lifetime beholding this view was not so hard to imagine."
