Text: "I flew out to San Francisco to attend a hackathon led by FreeCodeCamp whose\
  \ syllabus I had been pursuing in my spare time. Travelling from cold Fredericton,\
  \ New Brunswick which is considered on the East coast of North America to sunny\
  \ California on the west coast would have been an adventure if I had not dislocated\
  \ my patella bone in my knee a month prior. I was now completely dependant on crutches\
  \ and flying out to San Francisco felt like an unclimbable mountain. Flying on crutches\
  \ at an airport is an experience, in of itself. I found that whilst the kindness\
  \ of the airport staff was amazing, waiting around for someone to be collected feels\
  \ dehumanizing somehow. The inability to climb stairs whilst having the pilot and\
  \ an air hostess pull you up was very dehabilitating to say the least. I have no\
  \ idea how people who have been injured for a longer period of time have the resilience\
  \ or patience to function on a daily basis. I can only tell you that, having been\
  \ injured for four months opened my eyes to how fortunate I have been my whole life\
  \ and I hope that in the future, I can do more to assist those in need. \nAs I arrived\
  \ at the San Francisco airport, I took a few minutes to catch my breath. The sound\
  \ of beeping and busy motors caught me in a trance. I am so far removed from the\
  \ city life that I grew up with in the slow-paced province that I currently live\
  \ in that I didn\u2019t realize how much I missed the daily grind of cars rushing\
  \ to get to their prey. The night sky glistened as I downloaded the Uber app on\
  \ my phone to try to find a ride to my hostel. The Uber pool driver being in a horrible\
  \ mood because of a previous infraction decided to drop me off a few blocks away\
  \ from my destination. This would not have been an issue but the hills in San Fran\
  \ are quite steep and being on crutches with my backpack filled to the rim, I endeavoured\
  \ to climb uphill. The streets were crowded because it was Thursday night and there\
  \ were hoards of people around looking ready to enjoy the evening.\nHowever, having\
  \ booked the hostel three months ago and my injury being more recent, it hadn\u2019\
  t occurred to me to check if the hostel was accessible. Once I got there, they informed\
  \ me that my room was on the second floor and that I would have to climb the stairs\
  \ to get up there. I requested a refund and my request was denied. So up the stairs\
  \ I went, there were three bunkbeds to a room and the host having denied my refund\
  \ was very accommodating in helping me set up my bed which had to be on the bottom\
  \ for obvious reasons. The people in the room were hospitable but I could not sleep\
  \ all night because of the arguments that they had with the host. The host finally\
  \ offered me a refund and I took it but I later discovered that the money never\
  \ returned to my account. The next day, I decided to book a private room in a different\
  \ hostel with an elevator because my health was not worth comprising to save a few\
  \ bucks. \nFinally, the first day of the hackathon arrived and it was worth it.\
  \ I took an Uber and found it amusing that several other competitors also chose\
  \ the same method of transport. As I stood in line to wait for the doors to be opened,\
  \ I met several people who all seemed incredibly pleasant and we decided to become\
  \ a team. The hackathon was a dream-like affair with the founder, Quincy Larson,\
  \ personally taking the time to inquire about my health. Sometimes, I feel like\
  \ San Francisco is the city in which magic happens. I found it in myself to keep\
  \ going despite not winning anything in the hackathon, I felt that it is not about\
  \ the final destination but having the courage to make the journey."
