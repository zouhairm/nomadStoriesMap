Text: "Back and forth, back and forth. And so I went for a hike. It happened twice\
  \ for the hole month I decided to be on the other side of the planet. And not the\
  \ first time only, but in both opportunities my legs took me to beautiful nature\
  \ discoveries. \n\nThe first time, we were invited to do the walk from Spit to Manly\
  \ Beach, a walk with friends, love and children that opened my eyes to every detail\
  \ of it. And every step brought a different unbelievable perspective. The wind was\
  \ shaking the trees smoothly, changing the colors of the sea between sunlight and\
  \ shadow, dark blue and light teal, the water so perfectly bright and clean that\
  \ I could only wish it was Summer time - because I wouldn't dare, me as a child\
  \ of a tropical land, to go into the ocean when the temperature is around 15 degrees\
  \ Celsius. \n\nI actually went hiking with a heavy coat, afraid of that same ocean-color-changing-wind,\
  \ and for my surprise, within a few minutes I needed it no more. Steps up and down,\
  \ chatting, hugging, it all made the walk more comfortable than I could imagine\
  \ it to be.\n\nThe second time I decided to go by myself. The amazing host and friend\
  \ that received me for the hole month in his house had to work. The new french friend\
  \ I met with a Brazilian in a Sydney bar, with whom I have a incredible bond after\
  \ - guess what - hiking, already had done this walk - and insistently recommended\
  \ It. And those were my last few days in an incredible land I chose to love. I wouldn't\
  \ miss that opportunity.\n\nNot that one needs all of that  to decide to do a walk\
  \ by one's self. Don't get me wrong. Deciding to know the unknown is more than enough.\
  \ Meeting yourself, your thoughts and desires is an uncomparable experience. But\
  \ there was something more.\n\nIn my first days in Sydney I saw something that was\
  \ new to me. If I had heard anything about that before, I had completely forgotten.\
  \ Bondi Beach. A swimming pool in the ocean. Filled with ocean water. \n\nI was\
  \ amazed. There was this guy, swimming against the waves. Because, yes, waves crashed\
  \ on the sides of the swimming pool, flew into the air, and then crashed back into\
  \ the water, into the pool, in front of the swimmer. Back and forth. Over and over\
  \ again. And he kept swimming, cold as it was, dark as the night already was, he\
  \ kept swimming.\n\nThat pool became a summer dream. I stayed for minutes that felt\
  \ like hours just watching the magnificency of waves, a water flight, the crashing,\
  \ the swimming. One arm after the other. One wave after the other. The same pool,\
  \ steady. And that was the final point of my second track.\n\nThe thing is: when\
  \ a wanderer wanders, not always the final destination is accomplished. And while\
  \ wandering from Coogee to Bondi, I lost track of a true ally - that sometimes becomes\
  \ a villan: time.\nI found cliffs, birds, seagulls. Found the most amazing and unforgettable\
  \ views. And, when the sun was saying goodbye, I found myself alone in a cemetery.\
  \ Both disturbing and amazing, there I faced a bit of fear, a bit of laughter and\
  \ some true inspiration. The things I didn't find were waves, waves in a swimming\
  \ pool.\n\nBut that's a wonder. Because, anyway, I know that the thing I wanted\
  \ the most wasn't to find it again - the same place, same time, same spot, same\
  \ waves... It wouldn't happen twice. I kept the memory. And I kept this dream: what\
  \ I trully wanted was to jump inside that pool, swim around feeling not only the\
  \ salty water while trying to swim doing perfect movements. No, not only that. I\
  \ wanted to do all of it while refreshing myself from the hottest brightest summer\
  \ sun. Back and forth, back and forth: summertime does it, waves do it, and so will\
  \ I."
