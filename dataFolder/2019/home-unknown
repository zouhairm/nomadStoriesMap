Text: "I was born in America. It has always been home and stranger to me, just like\
  \ my  parents homeland in Haiti; always feeling as though I belonged and didn't\
  \ in the same breath. \n\nI have never been to Haiti, I am almost 30 and have never\
  \ stepped foot on the homeland that my parents cherish and call home. I am as engrossed\
  \ in the culture as an American born can be. I speak Creole fluently, I eat the\
  \ food and I grew up a true Haitian kid but my parents never brought me back. I\
  \ still am perplexed by that, they have been back as much as they can but I stay.\
  \ \n\nI think if I am being honest, I am terrified of being rejected by the land\
  \ I have heard all these amazing stories about of people I admire for their strength\
  \ and resolve.\n\nThis essay was suppose to be about where I have been, I haven't\
  \ been anywhere so let me start there. I have seen so little of this beautiful world.\
  \ This essay is my stepping stone into reclaiming my thirst for adventure and culture\
  \ regardless of how terrifying it may be.\n\nMy first stop is a solo trip to Haiti\
  \ in March for my 30th birthday, a rebirth surrounded by my ancestors. I am sure\
  \ I will encounter challenges but I am so hype for the beauty that awaits me, the\
  \ people, the land. I am actually excited for the missteps, for the turns I take\
  \ that reveal the beauty that has always been home and unknown."
