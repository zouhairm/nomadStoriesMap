Text: "It was late August. My boyfriend and I were camping at a small game reserve\
  \ called 'Marakele' just north of Pretoria, South Africa. The last of winter\u2019\
  s biting breeze had begrudgingly subsided, leaving our campsite dry and surrounded\
  \ by spindly, ash-coloured trees. The air was sticky with heat when we arrived,\
  \ and as we put up the tent with dust clinging to our fingers and palms, the familiar\
  \ clicking and ticking of the African bush welcomed us for the weekend.\n\nWe were\
  \ proud of our spot. We had driven around the open camping area several times looking\
  \ for the perfect place to pitch our tent. We were very unimpressed with the wrinkly\
  \ man and his beer-boep for hogging two spots on the border, and we had an awkward\
  \ stare down with a large Afrikaans family who were spilling into the vacancy next\
  \ to them. On our fourth lap around the campsite we settled for a spot without the\
  \ open view of the mountain but also without neighbours, giving us a real sense\
  \ of peaceful adventure. The stress from earlier was now ebbing away with a cold\
  \ Savanna Dry and the soft crackle of a growing fire.\n\nThe forest around us was\
  \ still, the narrow trees resembling a fading bar-code. The longer we sat and watched,\
  \ the more our eyes adjusted to the grey palette, singling out the various bony\
  \ branches. What seemed at first to be a dead landscape was slowly revealing its\
  \ life through the occasional sweep of a bird and flash of a cricket. Something\
  \ large moved\u2026\n\n\u2018Oooh, an ostrich!\u2019 I announced, pointing through\
  \ the trees at the lanky bird.\n\nAs my boyfriend sat up to look, the ostrich lifted\
  \ its tubular neck and angled its balding head towards us.\n\n\u2018You know those\
  \ things can be dangerous,\u2019 he commented.\n\nI shuffled my chair closer to\
  \ his when the ostrich started wandering towards us. I watched the ugly bird with\
  \ surprising nervousness as it reached the clearing we were in and stalked past\
  \ us, towering higher than I had imagined and looking very haughty indeed. I was\
  \ relieved when it eventually sauntered away, but I was left wondering about what\
  \ else might be out there in the wilderness.\n\nAs night fell from the sky and seeped\
  \ into the trees, we nursed the golden embers of the fire left over from the braai.\
  \ We were now sipping on soft red wine whilst sitting in our camping chairs on the\
  \ edge of our campsite, facing the dark, quiet forest.\n\nWe let the fire die and\
  \ switched off our torches. Slowly, our eyes adjusted - the clawed outlines of the\
  \ trees came into focus, etched into the shadows created by the sliver of moon.\
  \ We gazed in silence, the whispers of our conversation fading like the light had.\n\
  \nSuddenly, there was a rustling from the edge of the trees. \n\n\u2018What was\
  \ that?\u2019 I whispered. \n\nThe rustling grew louder and turned into scuttling\
  \ and scratching, getting closer with each scrape, growing in volume.\n\n\u2018\
  Get the light, get the light -\u2019 my boyfriend muttered hastily, and the nerve\
  \ in his voice sent a swell of fear up my throat as I fumbled for the torch. \n\n\
  I could sense the creature in the dark, no more than a meter away. There was a pair\
  \ of hovering, glinting eyes... With a click I found the switch and my torch spilled\
  \ light in the direction of the noise.\n\nOur reaction was not one of fear, but\
  \ instead, confusion.\n\nI did not expect to see a kangaroo in Africa.\n\n\u2018\
  What \u2026. is that?\u2019 my boyfriend asked, curiosity taking over the shock.\n\
  \nThe creature had large hind legs, pointy ears and a long, powerful tail. It was\
  \ nibbling something on the ground.\n\n\u2018The lovechild of a rabbit\u2026 and\
  \ a kangaroo?\u2019 I laughed.\n\nWe stared in disbelief until it hopped away, and\
  \ later worked out that it was a 'Springhaas' - a Springhare. \n\nWe still call\
  \ it a Rabba-roo.\n\n\u2018Have you ever\u2026?\u2019 I began.\n\n\u2018Never,\u2019\
  \ my boyfriend replied, also having visited the bush his whole life.\n\nWe sat there\
  \ for a long time after, in awe of South Africa\u2019s constant ability to surprise."
