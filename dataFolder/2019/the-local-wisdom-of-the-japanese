Text: "My two-month trip in Japan gave me lots of experience.  Actually, my visit\
  \ was to participate in the School Visit Program held by IofC Japan. Along with\
  \ my team, I visited eleven cities and stayed in hotels and local people houses.\
  \ Surely, I learned many things such as culture and a little Japanese language.\
  \ The most interesting thing was seeing lots of people go to work on foot although\
  \ we know Japan is well-known for its vehicle industry. They use public transportation\
  \ which is very comfortable.  They also seem more comfortable using bicycles to\
  \ go work rather than their own cars. This situation is contrary to what I see in\
  \ my country where people are proud to drive their cars to work.\n\nDuring two months,\
  \ I visited 30 schools from kindergarten to university level. I interacted with\
  \ the students, presented my own countries, played with them and shared about my\
  \ personal experiences. I was amazed when I visited elementary schools in cities.\
  \  I could see the importance of Japanese education and the excellent facilities.\
  \  The activities held in school are also varied and interesting. Students have\
  \ lunch together with friends in the class.   Teachers choose students to be the\
  \ server for the day. They eat healthy food including rice bowl, fruit, vegetables,\
  \ and a small box of milk. After drinking their milk, they collect the small boxes\
  \ to be recycled. And they do it by themselves! \n\nAt the end of our program, I\
  \ had an International Forum attended by 13 countries and some international friends\
  \ including the President of Initiatives of Change International, an International\
  \ Non Government Organization based in Switzerland, Dr. Omnia Marzouk. We had a\
  \ 3 day forum, \"Celebrating Diversity\", in which we discussed issues relating\
  \ to diversity.  The theme means we have already understood and accepted diversity\
  \ and that is why we celebrate it. I think this issue is very good as nowadays we\
  \ are facing many conflicts around the world. One of the causes is maybe because\
  \ people cannot accept diversity.  \n\nThis two-month experience enriched my knowledge\
  \ of Japan and its culture. It taught me how I live in diversity. Although I was\
  \ minority, they respected me very well as a person who comes from different background\
  \ and religion. When I had my fasting in Japan, my host family took care of me very\
  \ well. It touched me how they served a person whom they don\u2019t know beforehand.\
  \ Finally, this journey has given me a good experience and I was very lucky being\
  \ part of this program."
