Text: "Traveling to Malaysia was like a dream come true, among all the traveling sessions\
  \ I've experienced in Europe as well as Asia, this trip was completely astonishing\
  \ firstly because I won the tickets for Malaysia through a lucky draw all the way\
  \ completely around the next corner of the world in Europe . Secondly because  I\
  \ being Pakistani not knowing any other languages other than Urdu and English  would\
  \ be spending time without the acknowledgement of Malai. \nKeeping one positive\
  \ and negative aspect  I reached the airport feeling excitement with a touch of\
  \ nervousness.  I boarded nervously and through a check point somewhere near Columbia\
  \ I finally reached Kaula Lampur, Malaysia .\nWith a mixture of complete surprise\
  \ and tension as soon as I stepped out of the airport heading to catch the train\
  \ which would be taking me to my booked Apartment through a online booking website\
  \ somewhere near the New Library I was thinking of the joy in learning new experiences\
  \ and gaining more wisdom of a completely new country. I reached the train, bought\
  \ tickets, adjusted myself on my seat and leaning towards the window observed the\
  \ new culture, lifestyle and modesty. As the train reached the station I came out\
  \ and followed the map I had in my bag for direction to the hotel.  As I kept following\
  \ the map I reached  a building which never looked like a hotel but a business resort\
  \ I stepped in and was stunned by the beautiful structure of the inside view which\
  \ was way beautiful than it looked from outside.  I reached the reception and fortunately\
  \ the receptionist understood English and gave me the keys of my booked room. \n\
  I took the elevator impressed by the beautifully designed patterns on the walls\
  \ and pillars, tiled flooring with an aquarium beneath it. \nI entered my room,\
  \ changed my clothes, odered lunch and after taking a short nap I came out of the\
  \ resort and wandered in the city exploring new places and modesty of the new country.\n\
  Days passes I came to know many new adventurous places as well as experienced traveling\
  \ in new vehicles enoyed tasty food which enriched my appetite, till the last day\
  \ of the week when I had to pack my stuff again for Pakistan bottled up with many\
  \ new memories, experiences and visions."
