Text: "Bleary eyed and staggering off a bus at 4am was not the way I expected to start\
  \ my first solo trip, I boarded to 8pm night bus from London to Paris expecting\
  \ to arrive at 6:30am as the sun rose in Paris. Not as the case was clutching my\
  \ 40L backpack and walking out of the bus station into an eerie rat covered park\
  \ at 04:00 in the morning with no plans and following the map on my phone trying\
  \ to find the nearest Metro. The way I had organised that bus was so that I would\
  \ arrive in Paris with just enough time to catch the train to Versailles for the\
  \ 8am opening of the gardens. To be perfectly honest I do not think I have been\
  \ more pissed, tired and anxious in the same moment as wandering around at that\
  \ time in Paris with nowhere to go and not a lot of knowledge of the sketchy parts\
  \ of the city. The godsend to me was a few of the other passengers on the bus, a\
  \ lovely French lady and two American ladies had had the same plan as me - get to\
  \ Paris in time for sunrise so as to immediately be able to enjoy the delights of\
  \ Paris without spending extra for accommodation. I initially just tagged along\
  \ trying to find some small comfort in having others in the same situation, all\
  \ the time in the back of my mind thinking \"I hope this month is not going to be\
  \ one big mistake.\". Travelling by myself for the first time was something I had\
  \ desperately wanted to do for some time, but at that point I was seriously considering\
  \ turning around and getting the next bus back to London. I am so glad I persevered.\
  \ \nThose three lovely ladies took me under their wing and accompanied me through\
  \ an amazing morning in the city. Watching the sun rise over the river with a croissant\
  \ and a orange juice has to be one of the more memorable breakfasts of the trip.\
  \ The good will of the lovely french lady buying me a train ticket when I could\
  \ not get the machine to work, and then refusing to allow me to pay her back, definitely\
  \ restored my belief in man-kind as well as instilling in me the confidence to go\
  \ on. I still continued with my plan when we parted ways at 7am heading to the magnificent\
  \ palace of Versailles and though cold it was one of the most beautiful days of\
  \ that month. Throughout my trip when things got difficult I looked back on this\
  \ morning and thought if I give up now what other amazing thing might I miss out\
  \ on, how many amazing people could I not meet because I decide to go home now.\
  \ My leap in to the unknown might be a figurative one, but I feel prouder than any\
  \ of the times I have been skydiving or cliff jumping that I took this leap to travel\
  \ by myself, and now I can't recommend it highly enough to anyone else thinking\
  \ of doing the same."
