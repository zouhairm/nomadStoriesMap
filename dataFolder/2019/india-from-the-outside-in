Text: "When I first received the opportunity to go to India I was a little apprehensive\
  \ in making my decision 1.) I would be a solo female traveler in India.\n2.) I knew\
  \ I would have limited to no internet connection. 3.) I would be utterly and completely\
  \ alone.\nBut looking back on my decision, I am so glad I had the courage to come.\n\
  The first week I arrived in India I got 2 hours of internet access, virtually I\
  \ was shut off from the rest of the world. Naturally, this scared me. Physically\
  \ I\u2019m half way around the world (12 hours to be exact) and mentally I\u2019\
  ve had to accustom to a 180 from my normal lifestyle. This is truly a different\
  \ world in rural India. Out the window is 24/7 internet, friends blowing up my phone,\
  \ weekend events, parties to attend, sporting practice, and my beloved workout routine.\n\
  I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you it has been a walk in the park, because\
  \ it hasn\u2019t but I will tell you. It. Is. Worth. It. Every emotion, every desire,\
  \ and every second of the day. I\u2019m basking in all the wonders God has set forth\
  \ here. Let me tell you it has been unbelievable.\nI\u2019ve experienced what the\
  \ average traveler doesn\u2019t see by living slow in India. I know the baggage\
  \ people carry, my co-workers family struggles, sacrifices and issues with the council.\
  \ I\u2019ve noticed how our drivers are up at dawn waxing and vacuuming their vehicles\
  \ before a days long journey with lodge guest. I carry out delicious dishes made\
  \ by our chef, who pays special attention to intricate detail. And not once have\
  \ I spent more than a few minutes in a villagers home, and not been offered chai\
  \ tea and a cool place to sit.\nThe world is unstable, exaggerated, misspoken and\
  \ unfair. But here, Jamtara is a safe haven tucked away in the most remarkable setting\
  \ of them all, pure nature. A perfect utopia that balances work, family, and play;\
  \ none of which is corrupted by todays society. The people of Jamtara only long\
  \ to love and to be loved, to make their family proud and to have a good nights\
  \ sleep. Isn\u2019t that all we long for anyway?\nTraveling has taught me we are\
  \ all very much the same. This trip has taught me the simple life is worth slowing\
  \ down for.\nThe Indian people have taught me, it is a privilege to be alive.\n\
  Every week I make it a point to bike or walk into the village of Jamtara just to\
  \ slip away from the lux life, and simply to buy gum at the village shop. Might\
  \ I add there is only one shop. I pick from two different types of gum, Center Fruit\
  \ individual packaged- coca- cola flavor or mixed fruit. The cashier\u2019s grandma\
  \ is usually stooped up by the entrance underneath the awning. She\u2019s 102 years\
  \ old. One day I asked the boy to ask his grandma what her secret to longevity was.\
  \ He replied, \u201CGhee.\u201D Or clarified butter, it\u2019s used in most indian\
  \ dishes.. I guess it\u2019s one of the many secrets to a long lived life. \nBring\
  \ on the ghee, please.\nI pass by women working in the fields and on construction\
  \ sites, swinging sledgehammers, busting up rocks, while barefoot in the heat of\
  \ the day. I can\u2019t even begin to understand how my floppy wave receives the\
  \ most dazzling smile, and genuine wave in return. I take to notice how strangely\
  \ striking the women look, like a group of colorful chatty birds, decked out in\
  \ jeweled -saris, armored with bangles, anklets and necklaces. Gazing out into the\
  \ sunset I wonder how they can be so happy under the most terrible circumstances.\
  \ \nJamtara is a poor village like many other small villages scattered around rural\
  \ India, but not desperate by any means. The lodge is making a significant difference\
  \ in the life of this village, and I\u2019m so happy to plant the seed in helping\
  \ make that difference.\nThe pure human spirit of this place is unbelievable, I\
  \ am cherishing it all, capturing it in a jar and taking it wherever my footsteps\
  \ go."
