Text: "I was bewitched body and soul. I didn\u2019t expect to see millions of baby\
  \ turtles emerging from their sandy nests and heading out towards the swirling seawater.\
  \ It was the time after \u2018Arribada\u2019, Spanish for mass nesting. Precisely\
  \ 49 days back, thousands of female turtles congregated near Rushikulya beach on\
  \ the eastern coast of India to lay eggs. Days later, the spectacle of their hatchlings\
  \ going into the Bay of Bengal and the second batch of Ridley females moving ashore\
  \ for nesting was magical.\n\nAfter a lot of internet browsing and research, I had\
  \ come across an organization called The Rushikulya Sea Turtle Protection Committee.\
  \ Mr. Rabindranath Sahoo, the turtle man of Odisha who also works for the NGO, gave\
  \ me the opportunity to volunteer. When I reached Gokhurkuda village, the beach\
  \ was enveloped with darkness, except for moonlight, light from fishermen huts and\
  \ a few twinkling torchlights. Serendipitously, I spotted a darker figure holding\
  \ a torch adjacent to a fence like structure. Mr. R Kamraj, a 58-year-old artisanal\
  \ fisherman, had something glorious to show me when I approached him. There were\
  \ 20 or so eggs in the nest, perfectly round and white. Then I saw it. A crack in\
  \ one the shells deepened and out came a dark green, rough-skinned and two inches\
  \ long turtle with its eyes shut. As the Sun rose, I realized this was happening\
  \ all around me. The sheer magnitude of the phenomenon left me emotional.\n\nThe\
  \ journey for the bale of turtles from their nests to the sea was rather strenuous\
  \ and demanding. With no mothers to assist, the little ones had to make their way\
  \ out of the sand pit and crawl in the direction of the water themselves. About\
  \ half an hour into the hatching, out of the blue a rare wave of female turtles\
  \ started wading on to the beach. There was a lot of traffic, some of which was\
  \ unusually two-way. I consider myself extremely fortunate as this miracle was never\
  \ witnessed before. There was a stream of miniature turtles moving towards the sea\
  \ and a stream of two feet long mother turtles heading towards the beach.\n\nMy\
  \ focus went to one of the pint-sized babies, who I named Joan after the Joan of\
  \ Arc. She was struggling to overcome all the sand on her and come out. I could\
  \ see her flapping those minuscule flipper-like feet, trying really hard. Finally,\
  \ she made it to the top and started creeping towards the sea. I heaved a sigh of\
  \ relief, but too early! Without warning, a crow dived and grabbed a turtle next\
  \ to her. Also, there were howling dogs ready to pounce on them. Joan moved ahead\
  \ with reassurance, fighting for her life. Watching her touch the wave of the sea\
  \ brought a sense of serenity over me. Alas! The hard-hitting wave carried Joan\
  \ back to the shore. But I did not see her give up. She was stubbornly persistent\
  \ and every time she failed, she tried her might against the currents again. Ultimately,\
  \ she emerged victorious, setting off to a journey in the gigantic ocean. \n\nSeeing\
  \ that, let out the philosopher in me. That little turtle taught me a valuable lesson\
  \ of perseverance. I discussed this with an editor of The Hindu, a national newspaper,\
  \ who was working on a documentary on Olive Ridleys. He said, \u201CHuman babies\
  \ have it so easy. They have multiple people to look after and assist them. But\
  \ these hatchlings have to struggle from the time they come out of the egg to the\
  \ time they reach the sea. \u201C\nI expressed similar feelings, so he asked me\
  \ to do a bite for his documentary! He told me that the next time an emerging female\
  \ hatchling will see the shores of Odisha will be 15 years later \u2013 when she\
  \ comes back to nest again.\n\nThe beautiful Rushikulya beach, the clear water of\
  \ the Bay of Bengal, the cordial people of Gokhurkuda village, the volunteer of\
  \ various NGOs trying to make a difference, and most importantly the millions of\
  \ little Olive Ridley turtles who were the epitome of courage and tenacity, will\
  \ never be forgotten. Thank you turtles, see you after fifteen years!"
