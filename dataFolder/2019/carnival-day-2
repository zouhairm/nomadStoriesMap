Text: "I left home with a hole in my heart. I left England with grey in a soul and\
  \ a numbness I couldn\u2019t shake. Sitting on the plane was a grubby affair, from\
  \ England to Sri Lanka with a playlist of songs that I couldn\u2019t remember the\
  \ words to. All my old favourites. \n\nSri Lanka welcomed me back the way it always\
  \ does, even though this time it was only for five days: heat that drew spirals\
  \ on my head, a smell of dust and hard work and sweat, and the music of a language\
  \ that I was still trying to understand. Going home is easy when every place you\
  \ go is a certain kind of home, and my uncle\u2019s house is always going to be\
  \ that place for me. \n\nMany meals and movies later and I was back on the plane,\
  \ still desperately trying to learn how to feel and trying to break away from the\
  \ losses I was leaving behind. I landed in Australia on Valentine\u2019s Day last\
  \ year, still hoping that all the love that had been taken from me was one day going\
  \ to come back.\n\nThe university was old and new and grand and friendly, and each\
  \ new path was a new place that I could find my way. Small trees and water fountains,\
  \ the heady smell of coffee and finding secret rooms. It was a leap. And the unknown\
  \ was irrepressible. I could taste it in every new building. And I just wanted more.\n\
  \nIt was Carnival Day when it all began. I stood alone in thirty degree weather,\
  \ little shorts and a leather jacket, hoping that my shyness wouldn\u2019t stop\
  \ me. I watched them pass me by - all the people walking up to different stalls,\
  \ that tangy accent, something familiar but unusual. I wanted more. Back then I\
  \ always wanted more.\n\nIt is odd to remember being shy. It is not a feeling I\
  \ know well anymore.\n\nI sat down and waited for courage to find me when two girls\
  \ sat on the other end of the bench. They were younger than me, much younger. They\
  \ couldn\u2019t tell. They asked me to come with them, since I was alone, and we\
  \ walked together through the crowds and into the world that I had been wanting\
  \ to join all my life. The world of independence.\n\nI stopped at a creative arts\
  \ stall. There were magazines there, magazines that students had made. Something\
  \ that I could be a part of. Wanting to be alone, that odd desire, had struck me\
  \ again, and I told the girls that I would be fine now. They were kind. They left.\
  \ I kept flicking through the brightly coloured pages and saw that this was finally\
  \ where I was supposed to be.\n\nWalking on, it was the women\u2019s stall that\
  \ made me stop. I spoke to a girl with long hair and skin almost the same shade\
  \ as mine. She wore gold eyeliner, and red lipstick that I couldn\u2019t possibly\
  \ ignore. Someone walked past and stopped to say hello to her, and my life was very\
  \ different after that. But at the time, I simply thought he was beautiful.\n\n\
  The stall were I met the welfarians had a duck pond, water getting lapping inside\
  \ a blue inflatable. There he was again, sitting and talking with a voice I felt\
  \ like I knew. The girl there spoke to me: she was Indonesian. I had never met someone\
  \ from Indonesia before. Everything in those days was bright and interesting and\
  \ new. And I was finally getting more. We talked and talked and I won a prize. At\
  \ the stall, he handed it to me.\n\nAnd that was it. That really was it.\n\nThe\
  \ rainy country was gone, the heartbreak was gone, the grief was dissipating; all\
  \ I knew was the scene in front of me. Australia, where my life was going to change\
  \ forever, this boy and this girl and a duck pond and someone who was ready to take\
  \ a leap into the unknown before learning that she did indeed have wings. \n\nI\
  \ was as far away from my old home as I could be. And nothing had ever felt better."
