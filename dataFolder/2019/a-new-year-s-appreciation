Text: "I started the New Year as I intend to spend the rest of it: self-sufficient,\
  \ at ease with the pains and pleasures of the day and open-hearted looking to the\
  \ horizon. I fed the animals early despite getting to sleep late. Last night - in\
  \ fact, the whole of yesterday - I marvelled at the extraordinary lessons we learn\
  \ following our cosmic pathways all the way to their end. Gabriele and I ended up\
  \ full of laughter walking back from a deserted Tortosa in an attempt to get back\
  \ to the finca for the midnight countdown after our failure to find a hostel in\
  \ Barcelona. In a kind-hearted turn of events, the old mystic abuelo came to rescue\
  \ us in his beat-up little car from the side of the dark country road. The stars\
  \ above were glorious. The kindly abuelo's gentle Spanish and wise amusement at\
  \ our trials in the city bubbled warmly in the car. We said a heartfelt muchas gracias\
  \ to him but he didn't join us for midnight - just disappeared back behind the kissing\
  \ gate. We were back just in time for me to brew a warm coffee and make some chocolate\
  \ crepes in the kitchen caravan, along with a little toast of beer. For the countdown\
  \ tradition, we supplemented grapes for mandarins and I think I managed to get 8\
  \ in my mouth before biting down and spraying juice everywhere. The night was very\
  \ cold and I barely got to sleep but today has been a much-needed day of relaxation.\
  \ \n\nI started work straight after more crepes for breakfast but took the weeding\
  \ slow. I did it more as a therapeutic meditation than out of necessity. Plus, the\
  \ chickens were vocally grateful for the big bucket of tasty leaves I threw them.\
  \ Then I decided to start 2019 fresh both in mind and body - a shower! Well not\
  \ quite. I boiled a couple of pots of water and had a squat-wash in the kitchen\
  \ but it was incredible. I've never appreciated warm water coursing into every corner\
  \ so much as I did then. And my hair - that really is a relief. I half expected\
  \ it to fall out after reaching a certain threshold of dirt. All day I've been rubbing\
  \ my skin in clean glee. It's been beautiful here on the finca, warm and sunny with\
  \ a gentle breeze. I shaved and trimmed my hair at the outside sink with the cracked\
  \ mirror and even washed my underwear using an inventive mix of baking soda, lemon\
  \ juice and a sprig of lavender flowers for scent. Just doing these basic things\
  \ today gave me such an acute sense of self-care that I've been floating on a cloud\
  \ ever since. \n\nBitem has been doing it's odd thing again, making me feel like\
  \ I'm in a science fiction film with its loudspeaker market announcements in brusque\
  \ Catalan booming all around the valley. The funny thing is I've explored that never-allowed-to-leave\
  \ scenario enough times now in my head that getting stuck here for the rest of my\
  \ life is starting to sound quite appealing. I'm growing fond of the lady in the\
  \ bar who laughs at my poor attempts to communicate, the bakery woman with the severe\
  \ fringe, the rotating cast of characters in the market and big fat (and crucially,\
  \ cheap) vegetables. Their directness is jarring but charming too. Tonight the Christmas\
  \ music has been blaring once again and, along with the illuminated white crucifix\
  \ visible from the finca, I enjoy these symbols of communion in the knowledge that\
  \ we are all hearing it wherever we are and whatever we are doing in this tiny town.\
  \ \"Last Christmas\" echoing through the streets proves that whoever is in charge\
  \ of DJing is not without a sense of humour, or irony, or parody...Bitem thus feels\
  \ very much aware of itself; its minutiae and its revolving troupe of inhabitants\
  \ serving out their lives every day with conviction and a stern smile. I'll be nostalgic\
  \ for a nostalgic town the last time I bid them all 'Ad\xE9u'."
