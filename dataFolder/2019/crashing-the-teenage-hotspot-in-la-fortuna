Text: "As I walked barefoot down a pitch-black path, in only a bathing suit, all my\
  \ personal belongings left in the car, pebbles stabbing my feet with every step,\
  \ I began to question my decision-making process. \n-------\nCosta Rica was never\
  \ at the top of my bucket list. It screamed tourist to me.  I like more off the\
  \ beaten path locales and immersing myself into the places I visit. I want to connect\
  \ with locals and see their country through their eyes.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t up\
  \ to me; on this trip I was traveling with 5 other people. Amazingly, 3 of my best\
  \ friends from college, one of their sisters and my husband were all able to get\
  \ off work at the same time. \n\nWhen I had thrown it out there that we should go\
  \ on a trip together, something I do on the regular, I never expected it would happen.\
  \ I\u2019ve been traveling on and off all my life , most of the time I always invite\
  \ friends, but they have never been able to go. \n\nIn college, I tried to convince\
  \ those same friends to sign up for a 6-week Spanish immersion program in Ecuador.\
  \ In the end, none of them went. Instead I signed up on my own and went with a group\
  \ of students from my school, whom I had never met before.\n \nTherefore, when I\
  \ suggested my friends and I take a trip together, the chances of it coming to fruition\
  \ seemed very slim. \n\nIn my extensive travels over the years, I had become jaded.\
  \ I had a vision of what \u2018real\u2019 travel was and I looked down my nose at\
  \ things that seemed touristy or fake. So, when my friends proposed we go to Costa\
  \ Rica I was torn; finally go on a trip with them, after inviting them for all these\
  \ years, or ditch them and go somewhere I considered more \u2018authentic.\u2019\
  \ \n\nIn the end I chose my friends.\n\nWhich leads us back to the night of my questionable\
  \ decision making; we were at the last leg of our rainforest tour in La Fortuna,\
  \ Costa Rica. The closing attraction was supposed to be a visit to the famous Arenal\
  \ hot springs. They are ubiquitious in La Fortuna. Most of them are luxurious spa\
  \ like settings, with beautifully designed pools filled with the therapeutic thermal\
  \ spring water. \n\nBut, as we are loading onto the bus, our tour guide tells us\
  \ we are not going to one of the many extravagant thermal springs, but to a secret\
  \ local spot he knows we will love. We look at each other skeptically but decide\
  \ to go with the flow. \n\nEventually we pull off to the side of the highway, right\
  \ before a small bridge. Our tour guide tells us to leave everything on the bus.\
  \ Everything. \nSo here we are walking down a dark path with no end in sight, with\
  \ no identification, no phones, no wallets, not even any shoes. We begin thinking\
  \ that we have walked into some elaborate scheme to kidnap na\xEFve American. \n\
  \nEventually after a treacherous 10-minute stumble in the dark we make it to the\
  \ \u2018thermal spring,\u2019 a small river flowing underneath the highway overpass.\
  \ After a few minutes of trying to telepathically communicate with each other, trying\
  \ to decide what we want to do, we give up and jump in. \nThe water is amazing,\
  \ so warm and relaxing; and the mud on the river bottom is perfect for soothing\
  \ face masks. Really, who needs a spa?\nSuddenly, a group of high school kids show\
  \ up and jump in with us, bringing along music and beverages. It was there I acknowledged\
  \ my stupidity; even in Costa Rica, a country that is truly over run with tourists,\
  \ there are Ticos, that are living out their daily lives. In high school I hung\
  \ out in a Burger King parking lot, sitting on the hoods of our cars, here they\
  \ head to the local hot spring. \n\nThis night spent signing Despacito and drinking\
  \ wine from plastic cups with local teenagers, in a small river under an overpass\
  \ in Costa Rica, taught me there is authenticity wherever you go, you just have\
  \ to be open to finding it."
