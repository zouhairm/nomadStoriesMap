Text: "I could hear his voice floating in on the breeze. A gravely, nasal, combustive\
  \ voice, ever ready for action. Or perhaps more accurately no action. His name was\
  \ Brett (well so the whole neighbourhood could hear). I followed the vibrations\
  \ down the drive, the constant twang into the mobile phone. He sounded like he meant\
  \ business. I had only just arrived. The slant of the sun was different, the bees\
  \ hovered in the steamy air. A slightly sweet, acrid smell assaulted my nose from\
  \ the local creek, recently turned into a hazardous wasteland from a factory fire.\
  \ What was this place I had landed in? His voice commanded I stop. \"Gidday, I'm\
  \ Brett, you staying in the unit down the end?\". I smiled and nodded, unsure of\
  \ whether to engage. Duplicity with the gatekeeper seemed like a game with no end.\
  \ \"How is your day?\" \"Where you headed?\" \"I hate politicians, what bout you?\"\
  \ \"Do you know how hard it is to be a single dad?\" \"Do you reckon I can sell\
  \ this bookshelf on gumtree?\"- these I could sense were my days ahead. My head\
  \ thudded, I looked up to the sky to see if a plane had left an answer in its entrails.\
  \ Journey away or into the scuzzy web of Beaumont street? The roasting concrete\
  \ and Brett\u2019s tongue had caught me fast. I was transfixed and a local (for\
  \ now)."
