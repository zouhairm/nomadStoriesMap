Text: "By Steve Goldstein\n\nIn one way, traveling to Madagascar is like going to\
  \ another planet. This otherworldly nation has the greatest variety of animals and\
  \ plants that can be found nowhere else.\nBut when I traveled there, I discovered\
  \ that it\u2019s challenges are the same as many other countries. Specifically,\
  \ the loss of forests that offset the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\
  \ slowing the negative effects of climate change.\n\nDiego Suarez (Antsiranana)\
  \ is a sprawling port in northeastern Madagascar, set on a promontory jutting into\
  \ one of the finest natural harbors in the Indian Ocean, perhaps the world. \n\n\
  Towering above the bay of Diego Suarez and its beautiful island, Nosy Lonjo, also\
  \ known in French as the Pain de Sucre or Sugar Loaf, is the Montagne des Fran\xE7\
  ais \u2013 a large mountain covered in dry, deciduous forest that is a watershed\
  \ for the surrounding area.\n\nFor years, the mountain has lost tree cover. Demand\
  \ for wood-based products from Diego exerts a strong financial pressure, so logging\
  \ for timber and charcoal production are continuing problems. Many area residents\
  \ depend on the sea for their living. \n\nBut in the dry season, when the winds\
  \ come up and it is difficult to fish, charcoal burning can provide income and a\
  \ source of fuel. Slash-and-burn agriculture is also a challenge.\n\n\u201CMaking\
  \ charcoal is not the priority of the people, but poverty drives them to use this\
  \ method,\u201D says Jimmy Razafitsalama, a young, passionate botanist, who is assisting\
  \ in projects working with the local community on reforestation, land management\
  \ and tourism plans. \u201CAfter consultation, they are more willing to use sustainable\
  \ practices on this site.\u201D\n\nTo ensure continued health and vitality for the\
  \ people, forests and underwater landscapes of the region, environmentalists are\
  \  providing funding and technical support to the regional government to establish\
  \ a new reserve called Complex Ramena.\n\nFormally designated in 2008, Complex Ramena\
  \ is a mosaic of protected areas that includes the Montagne de Fran\xE7ais, the\
  \ Orangea Reserve \u2013 on the site of a former military base \u2013 and the Baie\
  \ D\u2019Ambodivahibe Marine Reserve. \n\nThe project name derives from the gateway\
  \ to the region \u2013 a picturesque fishing village called Ramena.\n\nThe dependence\
  \ of the Ambodivahibe community on the watershed, and the unique biodiversity there,\
  \ makes a compelling case for the preservation of Complex Ramena as a place where\
  \ nature and humans can thrive. \n\n\u201CWe have good synergy and there are a lot\
  \ of benefits here, not just for the local population and Madagascar, but for the\
  \ rest of the world,\u201D says Razafitsalama.\n\nOn the surface, conservation seems\
  \ straightforward: Preserve and the world is a better place.\n\nWhat I witnessed\
  \ in Madagascar was a lesson in balance. There are livelihoods that must be preserved,\
  \ as well as the environment.\n\nLying in my bunk in a rough camp, hearing the eerie\
  \ call of the lemur, I marveled at the majesty of this island nation. And the lessons\
  \ in can teach."
