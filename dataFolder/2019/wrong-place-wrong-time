Text: "\u201CHalt!\u201D\n\nA sharp bark echoing across the concrete slab, bouncing\
  \ off the rusted machinery and wrapping itself around our legs. Uttered with that\
  \ no-nonsense bite only a foreign officer with an assault weapon can deliver. \n\
  \nHe was behind us. Looped his way through the cluster of shrub and vine and taken\
  \ us off guard. We\u2019d been too busy staring through viewfinders and trying to\
  \ avoid a case of with tetanus. How long had he been following?\n\nTwo other appeared\
  \ in front of us, led by two German Shepherds pulling at their tethers. The meat\
  \ and potato lunch sitting in my stomach liquified and trickled into my colon. Nothing\
  \ like a bald Czech man with a firearm and hungry police dog to blanch those badass\
  \ high school memories of outrunning screaming security guards in abandoned buildings.\
  \ \n\n\u201CLet me handle the talking,\u201D Filip said. \n\nGood. I knew the basic\
  \ greetings and maybe three total expressions in Czech. I was most proud of being\
  \ able to ask \u201CCan I have a pound of the turkey?\u201D\n\nMy shoulders sagged\
  \ from the weight of sudden exhaustion. Raise my arms or just keep them at my sides?\
  \ My knees wobbled. \n\nI looked up at one of the apartment buildings. Loose cloth\
  \ hung from the windows, threatening to knock over famished plants resting on sills.\
  \ I scanned for faces, but none came to the squares. \n\nFilip had said this place\
  \ was open for exploring. He\u2019d done it before. With friends. And there\u2019\
  d been other people here, too. Doing the same thing. Just a little urban exploration.\
  \ \"You can get some great pictures. Black and white ones. Lots of graffiti!\"\n\
  \nThere was nobody else around. Sure, the yellow signs littered with exclamation\
  \ points and written in a harsh, demanding font cut through any question of whether\
  \ this abandoned factory was off limits. But the bramble-choked watchtower was visible\
  \ from the railway stop. Hell, there was even a little path that led right to it!\
  \ Whispering its secrets to curious adventurers, inviting you to trouble. Just like\
  \ Filip. \n\nI had passed up an afternoon of drinking dark beer and sitting by the\
  \ sun-splashed river to travel an hour and a half into the countryside. By now our\
  \ friends would be settling on a restaurant for dinner. \n\nThe guard wore a blank\
  \ expression. Forearms corded with muscle. A lingering scent of cigarettes. He stopped\
  \ in front of us and spoke in stern strings of Czech. He held out his hand. \n\n\
  I\u2019d read about these sorts of things. Cops demanded passports then held them\
  \ for money. Or maybe they\u2019d arrest us, no questions asked. Memories of Locked\
  \ Up Abroad sprang into an overly stimulated brain. But I was clear-headed in one\
  \ regard: I wanted to strangle Filip. \n\n\u201CHe needs to look at your passport,\u201D\
  \ Filip said from my side. \n\nOh god. Here it was. I had maybe 300 koruna. What\
  \ would I be willing to do if it didn\u2019t cover it? I saw the headline: Dumbass\
  \ American locked up abroad for trespassing in abandoned nuclear facility\u2026\n\
  \nThe guard flipped through the pages, looked from the square photo to my face,\
  \ the photo again, my face. I was sweating more than when the Walgreens employee\
  \ snapped the portrait. \n\nAnother line: Witnesses say he voided a goulash lunch\
  \ while fainting\u2026\n\nThe guard stared into my eyes. Then he looked to my companion\
  \ and spoke.\n\nFilip responded in a laid back Czech. The bald man looked us over\
  \ and then let out a laugh. Filip kept going and held up his camera. The two of\
  \ them laughed. He flipped through the pictures he\u2019d taken and deleted them.\
  \ The bald man pointed at my startled face and kept laughing. He handed back the\
  \ passport, slapped Filip on the shoulder and said something long and upbeat, signaling\
  \ behind him. He gave us a nod, and the three men and happily panting dogs walked\
  \ past us.\n\nMy vision stretched back into focus. My pulse returned to a steady\
  \ beat.\n\n\u201CWhat the hell was that?\u201D I gasped. \n\nFilip shuffled the\
  \ pack across his shoulders and started walking. \n\n\u201CEh, I got it mixed up.\
  \ We\u2019re in the wrong abandoned factory. The right one is just across the street.\u201D"
