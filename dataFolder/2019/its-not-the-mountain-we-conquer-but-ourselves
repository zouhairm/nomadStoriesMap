Text: "When I look at the world map, in my living room which overlooks the stunning\
  \ rural coastal town of Mangawhai, I get a sense of anxiety. I am in my home country\
  \ but there is much more to see and conquer.  I am home but I can\u2019t ignore\
  \ the emotional tug in my heart that my soul is not permanently home, I am longing\
  \ for that next euphoric moment, the next highest mountain I will climb, the next\
  \ human-being I will meet who has their own life story to share; their own lessons\
  \ to teach.  \n\nTravelling creates vast emotional states, in your mind you always\
  \ want to be somewhere else, so how are you participating with \u2018living in the\
  \ moment\u2019 when you\u2019re visually planning your next trip, how do you knowingly\
  \ appreciate what you already have and how can you recreate that feeling of home\
  \ when you are addicted to travel?  Is it in the body or does this require a home\
  \ in the socially accepted sense of the word - a building or structure for safety\
  \ and security?  And now with social media I question how I measure up against others\
  \ and if you are like me where I would rather die owning memories than houses this\
  \ comparison can seriously question your purpose in life. \n\nTravelling challenges\
  \ Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of human needs daily, as nomads, we are constantly searching\
  \ for core physiological needs to survive like food, water, warmth, rest; safety\
  \ needs like shelter for the night; belonginess and love through human connection;\
  \ self-actualisation and esteem needs through achievement.  It takes time and energy\
  \ for survival in countries with significant language and cultural barriers. However,\
  \ the one thing we all have in common are human needs and through travelling I have\
  \ been fortunate to experience profound love and kindness from the most impoverished\
  \ communities.\n\nThe one experience that truly reshaped my way of thinking and\
  \ living according to my own agenda was climbing base camp Everest.  Many natives\
  \ had never left the Himalayas, their village located thousands of kilometres from\
  \ any developed town and only accessible by helicopter or on foot.  I marvelled\
  \ at this concept, about the beauty of their mind being so empty from the suffering\
  \ and pain so many people live in, with a world that is constantly changing through\
  \ advanced technology, crimes inexplicable to the ear and natural disasters that\
  \ seem to wipe out humans on a larger scale known than before. But also the beauty\
  \ of their mind lacking in knowledge as to how the \u2018rest of the world\u2019\
  \ functions, they see aging on the outside but remain a child\u2019s mind, never\
  \ experiencing the fear of \u2018missing out\u2019 or \u2018lack of\u2019 because\
  \ of their habitual beliefs, they have all they need to survive, right on the highest\
  \ mountain in the world. The natives are the happiest, most peaceful, soul bearing\
  \ people I have met on our planet.  Their joy is evident every time they smile,\
  \ when they are slowly meandering through town in their bare feet to do errands\
  \ or to stop and talk to a neighbour who is barely wearing a cloth for cover, and\
  \ what made me super proud was the joy they expressed upon knowing I was from New\
  \ Zealand, instantly I was family. We were no longer strangers but people from the\
  \ same country, we could speak the same language, the feeling of belonging and being\
  \ home was overwhelming. I felt safe from the world, it was a place where problems\
  \ ceased to exist, it was just me, the natives and the abundance of mountain peaks.\
  \ I was so envious of these people, of living a simple life, being so humble, helpful\
  \ and selfless but it also created a feeling of guilt for all the times I wanted\
  \ more in my life, more money, more happiness, more love, more of where I saw lack.\
  \  It is this experience that I visualise as a reminder to trust when fear starts\
  \ to consume me with the unknown.  I can always allude my mind to believe I can\
  \ create from what I have, were I am and through the shared understanding of human\
  \ needs to survive."
