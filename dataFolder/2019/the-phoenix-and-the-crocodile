Text: "Apparently, I might not be considered a 'traveler.' I was approached by a photographer\
  \ in a bar in my home city who had just returned from his travels to photograph\
  \ extreme sports in the middle east. I was intrigued and fascinated by his adventure,\
  \ but when I told him I was a traveler, his first question was 'how many countries\
  \ have you been to.' \n\nWhen I told him I had only left Australia once, he proceeded\
  \ to question my definition of Travel. I asked him where he had spent the majority\
  \ of the year, or how many of those weeks were spent in the same place as the one\
  \ before it. For me, the beauty of travel can be found in your own country as well,\
  \ and why look for beauty outside your own vast and expansive backyard when there\
  \ is plenty to be found there? \n\nOur backyard, Australia, is filled with the spirit\
  \ of place, and those who choose to connect to it can find the dream-time that the\
  \ first Australians speak of.\n\nDuring our Australia travels this year, my partner\
  \ and I set out on a mission to trade winter  for the sun of tropical Far North\
  \ Queensland. Travelling with our van, we found what we were looking for.\n\nHowever\
  \ it is increasingly difficult to find suitable camping locations in many parts\
  \ of Australia outside of tourist parks. Moments before giving up, we tried one\
  \ last gravel track and despite a no-camping sign, found a friendly fellow parked\
  \ up with his station-wagon. \n\n\"Do you know anywhere we could camp around here?\"\
  \nThe head-scarfed stranger, perched leaning on his wagon looked up from his Sudoku\
  \ puzzle and paused... \n\n\"well... here!\" he exclaimed with a friendly expression.\
  \ Our new neighbour educated us on the neighbouring properties, the creek, the history\
  \ of the area including all the sand that had recently washed down from the recent\
  \ floods up at Big Sands, and the fact that no camping rangers patrolled the area.\n\
  \nAnd of course, Phoenix. \n\nIt didn't take long to notice that an incredibly well\
  \ kept Rooster had also made itself at home among the rogue campsite. What our neighbour,\
  \ Pete, tells us is that every year he makes the pilgrimage from his home further\
  \ south to avoid the cold weather as well. In previous years, a different rooster\
  \ had inhabited the site. Last year, however, a gang of foxes got to the rooster\
  \ and that was the last of his feathered friend.\n\nThis year, however, a new Rooster\
  \ had appeared with even grander plumage.\n\nPhoenix.\n\nIt was difficult to say\
  \ goodbye to our neighbourhood which had grown by a few by the time we were due\
  \ to move on, but the Daintree Rainforrest called us further north. \n\nWe were\
  \ lucky enough to have the local knowledge and residence of my partners oldest friend\
  \ from Kindergarten, Oop, who had made himself at home among the Rainforrest. It\
  \ was through Oop that we were introduced to Aunty Linda.\n\nAn Indigenous Elder,\
  \ Oop had been working with Aunty Linda to enlist the local council to change some\
  \ of the local banners to represent the voice and stories of the indigenous culture\
  \ as well as the traditional western banners that have been placed up by council.\
  \ \n\nWe were lucky enough to get to visit Aunty Linda and see some of her Artworks\
  \ which have been made into a deck of cards and each card and corresponding artwork\
  \ relates to a dream-time story and many of them an animal spirit. \n\nOne of the\
  \ cards pulled was the Crocodile, and Aunty Linda reminded us of the true nature\
  \ of the Crocodile. \n\nAlthough there are signs all over Far North Queensland reminding\
  \ tourists of the dangers of the Crocodile, Aunty Linda reminded us that The Crocodile\
  \ is also considered The Protector.\n\nOur trip to Far North Queensland is remembered\
  \ fondly as one of the highlights of our entire travels because of these connections;\
  \ \n\nAnd we learned from these two tales:\n\n* the spirit of place ALWAYS offers\
  \ us a Phoenix, rising from the ashes of what once existed there.\n\n* there is\
  \ ALWAYS another side to every story. What one considers a danger, another may consider\
  \ a protector."
