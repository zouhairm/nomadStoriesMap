Text: "It is said eyes speaks a lot when you don't have the right words to speak,\
  \  your expression says it all.  \nIt all started with me landing to a country where\
  \ i had never thought of settling for a while with my life partner.  \nBut the vibes\
  \ that a new place gives you says it all, Egypt was my destination, a country in\
  \ North africa, a place in middle eastern,  a country away from your primary langauge\
  \ hindi or English that you can speak,  a place which is a small town yet one of\
  \ the safest place to say.  \nYou are greeted with smiles and happiness,  people\
  \ treat you like you are one amongst their family members,  Yes they love Indians\
  \ even if your language may not be common even if you may hardly know how to speak\
  \ arabic,  they help you to say words and frame sentence, another best part is yes\
  \ while you are crossing they will let you go your way and stop mid way, it isn't\
  \ the other way round .  It's not a local connection with an individual but with\
  \ the people living in your town, in your new city,  yes you can walk and talk with\
  \ pride. You are in love with the safety, a women expects in the locality she resides.\
  \ With the climate, with the winds blowing its a connection with your heart,  a\
  \ memory that could never fade and remain all throughtout life."
