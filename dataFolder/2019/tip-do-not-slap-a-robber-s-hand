Text: "If there's one piece of advice I can give you - always listen to your gut.\
  \ Of course when you\u2019re hungry, but I\u2019m talking about intuition.\nIf there\
  \ is any doubt as to why, here's the explanation:\n\nI've never really liked yoga,\
  \ no matter how hard I\u2019ve tried. \nFor some reason, this didn't affect my attitude\
  \ towards finding that yoga class on that fateful day.\n\nIt all started in San\
  \ Marcos La Laguna, a village on the shores of Lake Atitl\xE0n, Guatemala. \nJumping\
  \ with excitement, I told my friend I found the perfect place to spend the afternoon!\
  \ but this pleasure didn\u2019t last long.\n\nThe lesson seemed to already be starting\
  \ as I lead us (with great confidence) to a mysterious place called \u2018Yoga forest\u2019\
  . The tuk-tuk driver who dropped us off explained \u2018seven minute's walk and\
  \ you\u2019re there\u2019. So we started walking and walking\u2026 seven minutes\
  \ soon passed. The sun began to set behind the mountains but we're determined to\
  \ reach the class. After half an hour, I finally admitted I must have gotten us\
  \ lost and that it's time to turn around. My friend let out a sigh of relief. On\
  \ our way back we encountered two men, and in a desperate last attempt, I asked\
  \ if they might know the way. \"Straight and right\" they answered. \u2018We might\
  \ still get to say Namaste\u2019, I tried to cheer myself up.\n\nFew steps and the\
  \ same Guatemalans came after us, saying they got confused and it\u2019s in the\
  \ opposite direction.\nSounds strange? Maybe. But hey, we had no reason to distrust\
  \ them.. so we turned back.\nHere was the turning point in which my gut knew better\
  \ than anyone what was going to happen next.\n\n\u201CI hope we won't get robbed\
  \ in the woods,\" I said softly to my friend.\n\nFive minutes passed and suddenly\
  \ they were walking behind us. We stood aside, letting them go first.\nBut they\
  \ stopped as well, gestured us to keep going. \"No amigos, esta bien\u201D, we insisted\
  \ to no avail.\nOne of them started to approach me, his hands in his pockets, his\
  \ eyes on my bag. There was no need to say anything, we realized the situation we\
  \ were in.\n\nDamn.\n\n\u2018Just don\u2019t be a knife\u2019 I prayed.\nNo knife.\
  \ I managed to take some air back into my lungs, an unsuccessful attempt to regulate\
  \ my breath.\n\nThe next step is unclear, but for some reason, as he was about to\
  \ tear the bag away from me - it seemed reasonable to me to slap his hand, like\
  \ a mother swatting the hand of a child trying to steal candies.\nFortunately, my\
  \ friend took a slightly more aggressive approach and tried to push him off toward\
  \ the slope. No luck. He was stronger than us.\nSo what advantage do we have as\
  \ girls in front of men? It's more correct to ask what we don\u2019t have, which\
  \ led me to try to kick him in the balls. I missed. \n\nSuddenly, a scream cut the\
  \ air, put me and the robber with the same stunned look. In front of me, my friend\
  \ with a jagged rock in her hands and a look that would scare demons, roaring like\
  \ a wounded animal. It was as if I was in a National Geographic movie! Without thinking,\
  \ I imitated her. This wasn\u2019t what the bandits had expected as they ran away.\
  \ Still rattled by fear and clutching our \"weapons\", we began to retrace our steps,\
  \ hoping to find the way out from this bizarre forest. A minute passed and we heard\
  \ people shouting from far - someone has heard us!\nSomeone? No less than ten Latin\
  \ men with machetes appeared in front of us. The rocks no longer felt so useful...\n\
  \nAfter they convinced us they came to help - we described the bandits and they\
  \ dispersed in an instant to chase them.\n\nWe've missed the class.\n\nBut if all\
  \ of this isn't enough, I said I did everything to get there, didn\u2019t I? That's\
  \ how we found ourselves two days later in the same forest, this time on the right\
  \ path.\n\nSeven minutes walk, and we arrived.\n\nThe yoga, by the way?\nThe most\
  \ boring thing I ever did."
