Text: "13 days, 5 countries and a 9 pound bagage. I am now going to tell you about\
  \ the best travell experience i have ever had!\n   Since I was a little girl I have\
  \ always loved everything rellated to travells. My go to activity was listening\
  \ to my mothers' travel adventures. When I was eleven years old my mom decided to\
  \ get her doctorade degree in Braga, Portugal. While that, we were living in my\
  \ born country, Brazil. That is when my whole life changed!\n  Life abroad was amazing.\
  \ It helped me oppening my eyes about how everyday you can live a new experience.\
  \ In 2013 emerged the opportunity to go even furder than Portugal, My mom, me and\
  \ my sister couldn't resist to our desire to travell trough europe so we signed\
  \ for these five country trip: Poland, Hungary, Rep. Checa, Austria and Slovakia!\
  \ I couldn't even imagine how incredible this experience would be. Because we were\
  \ flying in low costs flights we could only have a small bag. It would not be a\
  \ problem if we weren't travelling on the winter. I could barely fit one big jacket\
  \ at my luggage witch means, same clothes every day!\n  Despite that, everything\
  \ was amazing and different from everything i expected! We only stayed in hostels\
  \ and because of that, we met the most incredible people from all over the world.\
  \ Travelling in a big group is awesome, by that time i discovered the real meaning\
  \ of partnership and leadership, we had the best guide ever, Humberto. We walked\
  \ miles and miles per day and the best part is that nobody would complain because\
  \ everyone was so gratefull to be there.\n   This experience made me feel alive,\
  \ made me want to explore every corner of this planet. When I look back, the stronggest\
  \ feeling that comes to my had is: What a great time to be alive!"
