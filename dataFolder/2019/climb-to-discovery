Text: "\u201C20 more minutes to get to the top\u201D I heard someone\u2019s voice\
  \ in the distance. This was my 5th resting stop in the last hour, the high altitude\
  \ and the lack of sleep was defeating my upward momentum. Hardly breathing, I looked\
  \ up and saw a tiny lady about 50 years old walking to the rock I was resting on.\
  \ The vivid local Peruvian colors of her outfit kept glaring towards me. When she\
  \ eventually reached me, she smiled and said \u201Cyou are almost there, you can\u2019\
  t give up now!\u201D.\nThe lady proceeded to ask me \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\
  . She was now sitting calmly on the rock next to me. Her garment was so vibrant,\
  \ the bright red skirt, the white shirt and pink striped poncho made her look like\
  \ a living flower. She was like the breath of fresh air I needed to continue going\
  \ up the hill.\n\u201CI come from Bulgaria - a country known for its blooming red\
  \ roses, steep mountains and golden beaches.\u201D I answered. \u201CWhen I was\
  \ 18\u201D I added, \u201CI moved to the U.S. in search of better opportunities.\u201D\
  \ Life in America was definitely harder than what I expected, however, thanks to\
  \ this life I was able to travel to the Machu Picchu mountain that day and have\
  \ the privilege of meeting this interesting person. \n\u201CTell me about you\u201D\
  \ I asked my new friend, keen on learning about her life. \u201CWell, I am an old\
  \ lady who likes to take tourists to the top of the mountain.\u201D She smirked.\
  \ \u201CI have lived in the nearby village my whole life and this is where I feel\
  \ very connected to my ancestors. I can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else\u201D\
  .\nHer strong sense of belonging was fascinating. Leaving behind everything I know\
  \ had the contrary effect on me - it left me doubtful about which place I will call\
  \ home. That doubt was the reason why I wanted to travel. Maybe I was going to discover\
  \ the answers on one of my trips. Maybe the answer was on top of this mountain.\
  \ So I had to keep on going to find out. \nTime had passed by very quickly. Talking\
  \ to my new friend had taken my mind away from my physical aches and made me focus\
  \ on my mental strength. Now even more than ever, I wanted to know what the view\
  \ looked like up there. I gave my Peruvian friend a big hug and whispered \u201C\
  It was great to meet you. Thank you for cheering me up.\u201D She smiled gently\
  \ and let go of my strong embrace. Her colorful shadow quickly disappeared down\
  \ the steep hill.\nI was now alone climbing up what looked like a natural stairway\
  \ of rocks. The green pastures around me were distracting me from looking down and\
  \ losing my target. Suddenly it all looked very familiar. It reminded me of the\
  \ first time I hiked a mountain as a kid in Bulgaria. The rocks, the grass, the\
  \ humidity was all similar. I felt like I was climbing the same mountain just seven\
  \ thousand miles away and 15 years later. At that moment, I had my answer. For me,\
  \ home was not only at one place. I carried home with me everywhere I went.\nMy\
  \ walking pace was increasing, I was stepping more confidently in anticipation of\
  \ arriving at the final destination. The clouds were beginning to get denser. I\
  \ realized I was so high up that I was in the clouds. Best feeling ever! Next, I\
  \ saw all these people scattered around taking pictures and selfies. Did this mean\
  \ I reached the top? I walked a little further to discover a big sign telling me\
  \ I\u2019m 3,061 meters above ground \u2013 I made it! I could see how miniature\
  \ the Machu Picchu ruins were. Yet again, I thought about my everyday life which\
  \ I was so tired of. I guess it wasn\u2019t so bad after all. You know- having a\
  \ mundane schedule day in and day out- ultimately for a career that afforded me\
  \ this majestic adventure. In the end, my only regret was not getting the Peruvian\
  \ lady's name."
