Text: "It has been a month ago since I got a work assignment to explore potential\
  \ tourism places in my city, Bandung. One of those places is Rosid\u2019s Studio.\
  \ When I heard the name of that place, I thought I would be visiting the usual art\
  \ studio, but I was wrong! \n\nCame along with my workmate, we arrived at the studio\
  \ in the middle of the day. Even though the weather was really hot, the atmosphere\
  \ of Rosid\u2019s Studio made me felt more serenity. The feeling came from the presence\
  \ of shady trees and wood ornaments that filled the front of the studio area. \n\
  \nBefore we have actually entered the studio, there was something interesting to\
  \ see on the outside. We found some Lumbung. Lumbung is a small wooden hut used\
  \ by farmers in Indonesia to store harvested rice. Another interesting part is about\
  \ the exterior of Lumbung that decorated with farming implements. In Rosid\u2019\
  s Studio, the Lumbung is converted into a multi-functional space that acts as a\
  \ library, prayer room and gathering point for the community.\n\nFollowed by the\
  \ excitement of knowing, we have finally entered the studio. In the studio, we met\
  \ Mr. Rosid, the art studio owner. At that time, Mr. Rosid was doing his artwork.\
  \ Afraid of bothering him, we asked permission to see around the studio and he allowed\
  \ it. \nWas built with a semi-outdoor concept, this studio is a workplace for Mr.\
  \ Rosid. He spent much time in this place. Not only a workplace, but we also found\
  \ some of his paintings. Most of these paintings were made on wood and painted using\
  \ a pencil. When other painters usually use oil paint, he chooses a pencil. He said\
  \ a pencil could help him get a painting more detailed. One of his paintings that\
  \ really amazed me is the big picture of a cat. The painting looks much like the\
  \ real cat, it\u2019s really realistic. That was my first time to saw a beautiful\
  \ art painting on wood.\n\nAfter seeing around the studio, Mr. Rosid took us to\
  \ the outside. He asked us to sit and enjoy the coffee that served on a wooden dining\
  \ table near the Lumbung. While we sitting, I got a chance to interview him. It\u2019\
  s a lucky moment to answered all my curiosity about the studio. So, I asked Mr.\
  \ Rosid to tell a story about him and the studio.\n\nHe begins the story about himself.\
  \ Mr. Rosid was born in a farmer\u2019s family in a small village. He is the son\
  \ of a farmer. After graduated from high school, he moved to Bandung city and started\
  \ his career as a painter without going to art college. When he succeeded in the\
  \ art world, he builds Rosid\u2019s Studio. Beside to exhibit his artwork, the studio\
  \ is a place to bringing back his childhood memories, especially to remember all\
  \ the hard work of his father as a farmer. No wonder if Lumbung and farming implements\
  \ are placed in his studio. Through his studio, he is hoping that Rosid\u2019s Studio\
  \ become a place for people to learning about cultural values and traditions which\
  \ are fast vanishing today\n\nAt the end of our interview, Mr. Rosid asked me if\
  \ there any book or paper to draw. I gave him a book and surprisingly he starts\
  \ drawing a picture of me! It was an honor could be painted by Mr. Rosid."
