Text: "Born in rural South Africa, I\u2019ve always known that there was more that\
  \ the world had to offer outside the huts, cattle, and mountains I was accustomed\
  \ to. Fortunately, my parents invested in my life through education. I went to multiracial\
  \ schools directly after South Africa\u2019s Apartheid era and so I know exactly\
  \ what it feels like to not only feel out of place, stick out like a sore-thumb,\
  \ but most importantly, adapting to new environments.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a\
  \ creative since I was a little girl. The arts and all its facets stole my heart\
  \ and it never looked back. Writing is my first love. Poetry, song writing, journaling\
  \ my experiences keep me sane ( for a lack of a better word). Unfortunately, as\
  \ you get older, the more you\u2019re pulled into society\u2019s definition of what\
  \ and ideal job is and ultimately who you should be. I have two business degrees\
  \ and was in corporate for almost 10 years. But I\u2019ve always felt out of place,\
  \ uninspired. As though I don\u2019t belong. I remember constantly writing down\
  \ my frustrations and desperately looking for direction.\n\nIn February 2019, I\
  \ quit my job and decided to go travel and see 3 African countries. This was my\
  \ first time outside South Africa. I went to Tanzania, Kenya, and Zambia. What an\
  \ incredible, mind-opening experience! I remember thinking why I had never done\
  \ this before? Following my return to South Africa, as I was reflecting, I realized\
  \ that it was that experience that I was missing. Meeting new people from all over\
  \ the world, discovering the heritage, culture and history behind all of those countries\
  \ was incredible. \n\nIt then occurred to me that in South Africa, only 20% of the\
  \ population travels. Most never know what it feels like to be in a plane, let alone\
  \ a different country. Whilst traveling , I started capturing and writing my experiences\
  \ via various social media platforms and the response was overwhelming. It felt\
  \ as though people were living through me. I had requests everyday to put up something\
  \ about what I had been up to.\n\nThat\u2019s when I started to understand the significance\
  \ of travel writing. Most people are unable to travel mostly due to affordability,\
  \ but a travel writer can at least enable them to share their experiences. It also\
  \ encourages those who can afford to travel but haven\u2019t to do it. \n\nWinning\
  \ this scholarship would be an incredible opportunity for me to work on how to improve\
  \ the skill of travel writing and really capture amazing experiences doing what\
  \ you love and making a career out of it. Travel writing is not at all common in\
  \ Siuth Africa and so I would love to represent my country and continent in global\
  \ platform and really prove that anything is possible to a willing heart."
