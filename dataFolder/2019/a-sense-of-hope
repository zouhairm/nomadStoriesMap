Text: "Nothing. That was the sound we heard as we peddled our way to the forest on\
  \ the outskirts of Vilnius, to a small town called Paneriai. It was the beginning\
  \ of an attempted week-long bike trip through the Baltic States.\n\nThere was no\
  \ wind, no birds or animals, not even the sound of insects. The sun, with a harsh\
  \ touch, beaming down through the trees. The grass was as green as green could get.\
  \ I guess that\u2019s what happens when a peaceful place gets turned into a pit\
  \ of death.\n\nWe had arrived of what was, The Paneriai Massacre. Seven pits laid\
  \ around the forest floor, each one getting bigger and greener than the next. We\
  \ didn\u2019t speak, if we did, it was at a whisper. Not sure why, maybe it was\
  \ the feeling of solemn despair, or a fear of waking the ghosts from the past.\n\
  I\u2019d been in forests before, but not like this. It was eerie, but at the same\
  \ time peaceful and extremely beautiful. The forest had become something else. A\
  \ protector of the dead, preserving the past for the future. You could almost feel\
  \ the fear that they must have felt as you walked along the path. The same path\
  \ they must have taken, all those years ago.\n\nUp to 100,000 souls lay rest here.\
  \ As my friend and I walked around, bikes in tow, the looming effect of what happened\
  \ here deepens. We realised, how lucky we actually were, growing up on the shores\
  \ of the East coast of Australia. Being here, it made us appreciate what we had,\
  \ what we have already done, and what we could do, even more. This is something\
  \ I genially didn\u2019t expect to feel. We grow up knowing how lucky we are, but\
  \ not fully appreciating it.\n\nI knew the history of the war, what happened. I\
  \ grew up with great grandparents who lived through it. I kind of understood why\
  \ they never really spoke about it, my father was a war buff, I knew more than most\
  \ of my fellow class mates but as we sat, looking over one of the pits, that was\
  \ the moment I fully understood why, because after all this time, it was still too\
  \ painful for words.\n\nYou could feel it in Vilnius as well, the dark shadow of\
  \ their history, still weighing heavily on the locals shoulders. You can see it\
  \ in their faces, from the young to the old. They haven\u2019t forgotten, and I\
  \ don\u2019t think they will for a long time to come. And seeing them smile, what\
  \ a joy that was to witness.\nOut of the darkness and fire, through the pain and\
  \ the hurt, the Baltic States have come through. And as we road down, back towards\
  \ the station, we leave with a sense of hope and wonder. To remember the past is\
  \ a curse, but to keep moving forward, now that is a blessing."
