Text: "I\u2019ve got my overcoat for the rain, the wind, the cold. I\u2019ve got wool\
  \ jumpers and long socks. I\u2019ve got five pockets, one for tickets and documents,\
  \ one for my house keys in Rome, one for medicines, a hidden one for money and the\
  \ free one for you-never-know. It looks already full. I\u2019 m not afraid, but\
  \ my mum put all her fears in my jeans\u2019 pockets, together with her mother\u2019\
  s and her friends\u2019s. Mothers know how to organize spaces better than everyone\
  \ else.\nI feel heavy feet: my father has the bad habit to stick things in my shoes,\
  \ he says just in case.\nHe put twenty euros and a little remainder folded in two:\
  \ \xAB pay attention\u2026 \xBB. \n I no longer know where to put my courage. There\
  \ is no more space for my sister\u2019s wish: \n\xAB have fun \xBB \nHowever, it\u2019\
  s my lifelong dream: my violin and me in Ireland.\n\nThere were sunny days in Belfast.\
  \ We haven' t seen such a hot august like that in the past ten years, says Marymer,\
  \ Gaelic teacher in Clare county. And I like this warm rain, I think.\nThe sun does\
  \ not exclude the rain in Ireland, and the musicians at Madden\u2019s pub do not\
  \ exclude foreigners. I am a foreigner, my accent does not lie. The accent of my\
  \ violin does not lie. In order to play this kind of music, you don\u2019t have\
  \ to be a musician, but you need to listen well and patiently. It is the same as\
  \ to learn your mother tongue.  Grammar is useless.\nIn the evening, sessions are\
  \ set by kids and old people, guys and foreigners, without idols and first violins.\
  \ All together in circle. An open circle.\nJerry, one of the best fiddlers, is next\
  \ to me, and hands a beer. The fiddle is the violin. The violin that you have had\
  \ since a long time, but it is a fiddle when you sit together with other musicians\
  \ and play this music. The same one, but a different one. And you become a fiddler.\
  \ No more foreigner. In front of me is Lisa. She attends the traditional music course\
  \ with me this week, she plays an emerald-coloured concertina, missing one button\
  \ and two teeth in her mouth. She winks at me and she slowly plays the refrain of\
  \ the giga we have learnt today during classes. I take the fiddle. The others start\
  \ to play; the grandpa from Limerick plays some variations with the whistle. Lisa\
  \ told me he doesn\u2019t know the notes, but this music is his mother tongue.\n\
  \nI can\u2019t stop staring at the singer, Ri\xF2. She weighs more than one hundred\
  \ kilos, and walks with a cane. She can\u2019t breathe anymore. But singing is different.\
  \ She has mother-like bosom, child-like cheeks and I look at her sad, tired, tender\
  \ eyes. I call her\u201Cblack fairy\u201D. Because of her curls. She smiles at me\
  \ and closes her eyes. She starts to sing. I don\u2019t know where she is going.\
  \ I\u2019m going with her. I don\u2019t know where we are.\n\n\u201CThe pub and\
  \ the ocean are not so far from each other in Belfast. Do you know how many worn\
  \ solitudes are here? Yet the ocean courts the rocks ...\u201D\nI never remember\
  \ the titles of these songs, they have ancient names, in Gaelic, welcoming and impenetrable.\n\
  \nLiam, Galway boy, arrives, he pulls out his cigarettes and offers me one. It\u2019\
  s cold and I don't even have a coat, I left it at the hostel.\nWe sit down; the\
  \ waiter brings us two beers on the wooden, faded-blue table. August-moon, orange\
  \ slice, isreflected in my favorite beer: the Blue moon. And Liam says \u201Cyou\u2019\
  \ ll pay for this one, it 's not even a real beer with orange!\u201D and laughs.\n\
  I do not have a coat, I do not have money. Then I remember. I take off my shoe,\
  \ take the twenty euros and pay. I take off the other one, the ticket folded in\
  \ two falls, \"pay attention...\" there are words on theoutside, I open it, \"to\
  \ the beauty\"\nI do not know where Ri\xF2 brought me, but I want to go back there."
