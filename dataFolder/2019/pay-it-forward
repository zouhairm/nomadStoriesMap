Text: "The doors open.  My quest begins.\n\nI'm met with crisp, clean air and the\
  \ sound of announcements mixed with the beat of shuffling feet. I step onto the\
  \ platform. For a station full of movement I'm struck by the sense of organised\
  \ calmness I see between its walls. I follow the signs adorned with both kanji and\
  \ roman characters aiding wary travellers like myself as we weave between locals\
  \ as they go about their day-to-day business.\n\nOutside the impressive station,\
  \ the sun is attempting to break through the intermittent clouds and warm the cool\
  \ autumn day. As I gaze around, I become aware of the lively buzz offered by Tokyo\u2019\
  s little brother, Osaka.\n\nI find a street sign to gain my bearings and begin in\
  \ the direction of my hopeful destination. Yet after wandering up and down the street\
  \ several times I am no closer to the front door.  I look around bewildered, scratching\
  \ my head and frowning. Surely, it should be right here... \n\nA middle aged, well-dressed\
  \ woman approaches me. Smiling modestly, she offers assistance. Clearly, she has\
  \ taken pity on me after observing my comical plight. After studying my map, she\
  \ nods, and signals me to follow her. We walk westwards; trusting she knows where\
  \ to go I become her shadow. We reach the door of an antique store. Together we\
  \ enter. The walls are covered with expressive scripts constructed with precision\
  \ and detailed maps of unknown destinations. Ancient stamps and coins littler the\
  \ counter alongside a vintage cash-register. Yet despite the disarray, all appears\
  \ to be in its place.\n\nMy guide hands over my once creased, now straightened,\
  \ map to the elderly man behind the counter. He observes it closely and begins to\
  \ rummage through a series of treasure-laden drawers, pulling out old relics in\
  \ search for something...a more expedient map...a compass perhaps... Finally, he\
  \ triumphantly produces a large, rusty magnifying glass. Laying the map down, he\
  \ examines it further with the help of his instrument to get a better look. I wonder\
  \ if we had missed some vital information, too small for the average eye to see.\
  \ He ushers a few words and gestures confidentially to the east. \n\nWe nod and\
  \ leave with a new sense of direction provided by the historic geographer. I begin\
  \ to anticipate how long my aid will remain with me on my search. Surely, she has\
  \ more pressing matters to attend to, yet she appears determined as we walk onwards\
  \ to the next crossroads. \n\nAs we venture forward, we turn a tight corner and\
  \ bump into an entity bigger than our bodies combined. I move my gaze slowly upward.\
  \ A pair of uncomfortable wooden sandals, sturdy legs, a white silk robe almost\
  \ covering a wide torso. A top it all, a round face with small features and jet-black\
  \ hair tied tightly in a bun. Not what I had expected of my first sumo wrestler.\
  \ An expression spreads over his face, an enigmatic smile. I attempt the same back,\
  \ nervous that my facial expression would reveal my thoughts. \n\nHe steps to one\
  \ side and gestures gently with one hand allowing us to pass. As we walk away, I\
  \ cannot help but glance back at this man, his size indescribable. As we re-focus\
  \ to the street ahead, we are met with the doorway of my destination\u2026Menya\
  \ Joroku\u2026my quest for this hidden ramen haunt would soon be fulfilled. \n\n\
  Together, we release a gentle sigh in relief.  I thank the woman profusely for her\
  \ assistance ''Arigat\u014D\", \"Arigat\u014D\". She nods her head with a slight\
  \ bow, as though I have in some way helped her. She alters her bag on her shoulder,\
  \ gives me final wave, and walks away in the direction from which we came. I watch\
  \ her venture onwards, in awe of the unrequited support offered. Speculating how\
  \ I could pay this kindness forward and inspire another to do the same in return\u2026"
