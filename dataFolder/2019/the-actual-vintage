Text: "The Place is Pirenopolis Goi\xE1s Brazil. There I found an unexpected peace\
  \ because I was so close to the nature, and the old, simple and beautiful arquitecture.\
  \ Pirenopolis is a small, cosy and charming city that has the best receptions ever.\
  \ The Waterfalls are  hundred around the city and the stone streets makes us go\
  \ back in time. Imagine that you have returned in the time where you feel to be\
  \ a time of peace and love in abundance, I don\u2019t even know if we had a time\
  \ like this, but we simulate it just walking on the streets. The Lovers visit the\
  \ place to celebrate theirs lifes together and good friends go there for the same\
  \ reason. The houses are old fashioned but very clean and charming, white walls,\
  \ colored Windows just like a cartoon movies, where you are a part of, even for\
  \ a few days. The waterfalls are magic, you can leave all worries and sadness if\
  \ you be brave and dive in the cold and magic waterfalls. So you must be brave!\
  \ live the life in abundance, enjoy every little second, and figure out how important\
  \ you are in our world. My trips makes me feel alive, and this trip to Pirenopolis\
  \ just changed a lot of bad feelings that I used to have."
