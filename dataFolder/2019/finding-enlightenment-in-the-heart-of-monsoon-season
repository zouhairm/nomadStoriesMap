Text: "Sometimes when you're looking for the answers, life has a funny way of giving\
  \ you exactly what you need at just the right time. Nine months into a \"gap-year\
  \ honeymoon\" and 31 years into the long, strange trip that I call my life, it did\
  \ exactly that. I went up into some of the highest mountain regions of the world\
  \ during the peak of monsoon season with confusion, anxiety, and regret in my heart\
  \ and came down from those mountains enlightened.\n\nYou might think that a \"gap-year\
  \ honeymoon\" with your long-time best friend and love of yourlife would be nothing\
  \ but adventure, happy memories, and smiles. Well, it was all those things and more,\
  \ for sure, but it did present challenges along the way that tested the strength\
  \ of our love. Admittedly, my new marriage was going through a very tough time.\
  \ We've now spent nearly every 24-hours of the day of the last 270 days together.\
  \ There have been some times where we've both, individually, wished for a vacation\
  \ from this vacation or should I be more honest and say each other. Things have\
  \ been said, feelings hurt, and thoughts weighing heavy on our minds. A sad but\
  \ true reality. This is where we both found ourselves as we flew over the slums\
  \ surrounding Kathmandu as we entered lucky #13 of our 22 country journey into marriage.\
  \ \n\nMy wife, Hannah, and I had been winging the last couple weeks of our journey.\
  \ We had gone back and forth many times on our travel plans and how we might want\
  \ to proceed. We considered taking some time away from each other somehow, and it\
  \ was scary to think about. We decided to enter the next country together but to\
  \ separate once there for 10 days to give each other some space within this year\
  \ together. Hannah embarked on a week-long yoga retreat in the Nagarkot village\
  \ of Nepal. I did what I did best and took the most difficult path ahead of me.\n\
  \nSo begins my 8-day solo trek to the Annapurna Base Camp in the first week of August,\
  \ aka the middle of monsoon season. I chose this trek because it matched my fitness\
  \ level, trekking experience, and was suggested as one of the best monsoon-season\
  \ treks. However, I was warned that I would be cold and wet for 8 days straight.\
  \ Why would anyone want to walk 110 km up and down the highest mountains in the\
  \ world through mud puddles, flooding rivers, cold showers, and primitive living\
  \ teahouses just to wake up at 4:30 am every day to catch the only 4 hours of clear\
  \ sky views and no rain?\n\nIn a lot of ways, this short 8-day trek is a depiction\
  \ of my life. I've always chosen the hardest path in life, despite all warnings\
  \ from trusted advisors, because I've always needed to figure things out on my own.\
  \ In other ways, I was seeking to punish myself a little. On my newlywed journey,\
  \ I said things to my wife in moments of anger that I could never take back. I questioned\
  \ who I was, who I was becoming, and why I felt such a mix of confused feelings\
  \ toward my own life and my most important relationship. More-so than punishment,\
  \ I wanted to find out those answers.\n\nThe journey was difficult. It rained from\
  \ minute 1 of day 1 and continued nearly nonstop for the next 8 days. Due to the\
  \ near-freezing temperatures, my soaking clothes never dried during that week. I\
  \ lost 6 toenails. I collapsed due to exhaustion on a 2000-stair climb on day seven.\
  \ However, I was rewarded this some of the most magnificent views I had ever seen.\
  \ More importantly, I came down from that mountain realizing that it's important\
  \ to be happy with yourself. Only then can you treat those around you with the love\
  \ they deserve. It wasn't a lack of love for Hannah but for myself, that led me\
  \ through puddles and stairs to the peaks of the world. From there, it was all downhill,\
  \ literally, as I journeyed back to Kathmandu to reunite with my wife with a positive\
  \ new outlook and a vow to improve myself."
