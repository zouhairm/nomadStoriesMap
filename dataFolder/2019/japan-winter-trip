Text: "Japan Winter Trip\nStuck with your daily routine? Why not planning on a trip\
  \ to a country which is entirely different to your country? What country do you\
  \ have in mind? Have you ever thought about enjoying your winter vacation in Japan?\
  \ Why Japan? This country offers a traditional attraction, combined with modern\
  \ touch. I, who live in Indonesia (country with 2 seasons only), indulged myself\
  \ last midst February 2019. \nFor the very beginning, I went to a local Japanese\
  \ pub (izakaya) to drink sake, local alcohol. Imho, travelling is not just about\
  \ going to a place, taking pictures in famous places. Having a cultural experience,\
  \ immerse yourself with local people will give you another countless experience.\
  \ You can see how they act, think, or react, etc. And Japan has a tradition called\
  \ nomikai  .  You can drink beer/sake with some snacks, example: potatoes salad,\
  \ fried tempura, or other dishes. \nWhat you can do in Japan during winter\n\uF0E8\
  \tTokyo: drink sake, see beautiful illumination, modern buildings. \n\uF0E8\tHakone\
  \ : eat onsen beef stew bread (bread filled with beef stew) to warm your body. The\
  \ outer part of the bread is a bit crunchy. Then you might want to eat Hakone Owakudani\
  \ black egg, which is said to make you younger. Don\u2019t forget visit the shrine\
  \ (also called jinja in Japanese). To get there, you will have across Lake Ashi\
  \ by Hakone pirate ships. Most people will take a picture in front of the gate (tori)\
  \ upfront of the Lake Ashi, so prepare yourself to queue to get a nice picture.\
  \ Hakone is a great place to experience Japanese culture, see historical monuments\
  \ and shrine. \n\uF0E8\tYuzawa Echigo (Niigata area): playing ski, sledding, onsen\
  \ (Japanese traditional hot bath), eat Japanese full set menu (although I think\
  \ it was too much, but healthy and delicious). During winter season, Japanese people\
  \ drink Amazake (sweet, healthy fermented sake to warm your body).\nThe sight of\
  \ Naeba mountain in Yuzawa is candy for your eyes! Enjoy the extravagant view of\
  \ white-silver mountains when taking a break during the ski activity. At night,\
  \ you can enter the Echigo Yuzawa train station. To drink sake as much as you want.\
  \ Here\u2019s the step: pay at the cashier, they will hand you a paper cup, then\
  \ you can drink sake as much as you want. You can choose any sake, then insert the\
  \ coin then drink the sake.  \n\uF0E8\tStill around Niigata: visiting Tokamachi\
  \ snow festival. See beautifully crafted ice building and icon. You can visit Tokamachi\
  \ by train from Echigo Yuzawa station. \nNote:\nWhy onsen? It\u2019s freaking cold\
  \ outside, so entering an onsen is the best way to warm the body, relax, soak the\
  \ health and beauty benefit up. Onsen is usually open air bath for women only or\
  \ male only (divided by sex type). But if you are not comfortable to be naked and\
  \ share the bath with strangers, you can choose a private onsen (Kashikiri) with\
  \ additional cost indeed. \nWhen in Niigata (Echigo Yuzawa), I ate Hegi soba. Hegi\
  \ soba is Niigata\u2019s local specialty food. It has a unique way to eat: use your\
  \ chopstick and dip the soba onto the mentsuyu (dipping broth). Youcan mix mentsuyu\
  \ with wasabi, sichimi, or anything you like.   \nBy the way, to go to Tokyo, you\
  \ can use any flight to Haneda Airport. As for me, due to cheaper price, I bought\
  \ Jakarta-Narita Airport ticket. From Narita, you can choose to go to Tokyo by bus\
  \ or train. Choose any option which will be more convenient for you. Finally, that\
  \ was my short but fun trip. Only 5 days! But it was pleasant and I believe will\
  \ heal your worn-out soul."
