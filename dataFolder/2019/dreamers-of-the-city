Text: "It was a very spontaneous trip planned with one of my dear friends, who herself\
  \ is an avid traveller and adventure seeker. For many reasons, she hadn\u2019t taken\
  \ a girls only exploratory trip to any part of the country, some could be attributed\
  \ to perceived general safety of lone women travellers in a country like India.\
  \ Nevertheless, us two, sneaked out a few days from our busy schedules, around the\
  \ famous and infamous festival of holi, and embarked on this simplest yet most delightful\
  \ journey we have had.\nI am an architect, very curious about culture and history\
  \ and she is an interior designer interested in all forms of art. HAMPI, a UNESCO\
  \ world heritage sight, got us so enthralled!\nThere\u2019s so much to take from\
  \ any journey, the bumpy bus ride, local food experiences, handmade merchandising\
  \ shopping,captivating views of the monuntain, river, monuments, long dwindling\
  \ roads, a moped ride, but one incident can set it apart from the others.\nWe needed\
  \ to cross the river to get to \u2018hippie Island\u2019, our accomodation. The\
  \ popular mode and an experience by itself was this \u2018coracle\u2019 ride. This\
  \ was a very modest wicker basket boat and our rower was a really young boy named\
  \ Deepak. The ride was just about 5-7 mins but Deepak got to talking and was generous\
  \ enough to give us a little extra ride time. In this place far from home, where\
  \ we didn\u2019t even speak the same language, we unbelievably had one thing in\
  \ common- dreams. Deepak charges Rs. 50 per ride (\xA30.5, \u20AC 0.75) and pays\
  \ the rent to the coracle owner and make hardly any profit. He definitely goes to\
  \ school and rides the boats only after. I must\u2019ve been a little flabbergasted,\
  \ but Deepak is full smiles, with hot March sun shining on our heads. With this\
  \ beaming smile and control of the coracle in his hands, he proudly tells us he\u2019\
  s working to save money to go to university!\nWe don\u2019t even realise something\
  \ as basic as education that came so naturally to us could be a far fetched dream\
  \ for a little boy in a faraway town, untouched by the bus city dreams followed\
  \ by constant hustle in everyday life.\nThe little boy made me stop and think for\
  \ a moment, dreams should be simple, clear and with a purpose. He is living right\
  \ in the middle of this huge tourist attraction, a city with great history and culture,\
  \ and he couldn\u2019t be bothered more. Just looks straight to the future. His\
  \ intent and content made ME believe he\u2019ll achieve what he\u2019s set out for.\
  \ I would be considered far ahead of him, in education, experience, age, privileges,\
  \ but he\u2019s the one who inspires. A spark to work for what makes you and keeps\
  \ you happy. A reason to stand in the heat, smile and be pleasant to travellers.\
  \ \nI am sure anyone who had the pleasure to spend these few moments with this boy,\
  \ crossing the river, would remember him fondly. He does give you some great shopping\
  \ tips too!"
