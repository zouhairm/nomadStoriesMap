Text: "Sarah fell in love with many things on her soul-defining trip to Thailand:\
  \ the sunsets, the peaceful mornings, the warm smiles of every person that passed\
  \ her by. She didn\u2019t expect to find, however, that she would fall in love with\
  \ teaching a little child named New.  \n\nSarah met New on the 23rd of December,\
  \ 2018. He was a slender boy: deep brown skin, a stern face that did not reflect\
  \ his youth, strong, thin legs that appeared battered by the sun and playing football\
  \ at lunchtimes. \n\nAmongst the curious faces that had appeared upon Sarah\u2019\
  s arrival at the school as an English teacher, New\u2019s remained resolute; unaffected\
  \ by the foreigner whose intentions were sincere, yet naive to the countless other\
  \ volunteers who\u2019d already come and gone with the same vision of \u2018making\
  \ a difference in the world'. \n\nNew was a bright child, albeit a very difficult\
  \ one too. He often incited violence against the other students as a way of distraction,\
  \ something Sarah found hard to manage. He would taunt her whenever she challenged\
  \ him. Despite this, Sarah observed the way he was always the first one to finish\
  \ his work, how he understood what to do without need for clarification. \n\nTo\
  \ her ignorance, the boy had been calling her a stupid monkey every time she'd spoken\
  \ to him in her first week. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s as if he wants me to struggle\u201D\
  , Sarah thought. Unlike the other teachers who merely saw New as a poorly behaved\
  \ child, Sarah recognised his capacity for greatness.\n\nSo, like a puzzle, Sarah\
  \ worked with New. Little by little, day by day. \n\nShe began to understand the\
  \ young boy; how his violence reflected a need for control, for attention. She also\
  \ understood that because of this, New had no real friends. \n\nOne day, Sarah saw\
  \ New walking into school with a boy much smaller than him. She\u2019d never seen\
  \ this child before. Later, she found out the little boy was his younger brother.\
  \ \n\nNew was walking back to class after lunch when he felt a slight tap on the\
  \ shoulder. He was surprised to see Ms. Sarah standing behind him, and couldn\u2019\
  t contain a grin.\n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D he said in Thai. Sarah had picked up enough\
  \ of the local language to know what New meant. She gestured for him to follow her.\
  \ \n\nThey strolled around the school. New had no idea what Ms. Sarah was trying\
  \ to do. They continued in this manner for about five minutes. Suddenly, they stopped\
  \ in front of a classroom. Inside, children were running loose; some were sat down\
  \ at their desks colouring, a few were playing with building blocks, another group\
  \ were dancing together.  \n\n\u201CWho is that?\u201D Sarah asked New unexpectedly,\
  \ pointing to a corner of a room.\n\nNew was quiet. He hadn\u2019t realised his\
  \ little brother in the classroom. He wondered why he was all alone. \n\n\u201C\
  My little brother. His name is Oum.\u201D \n\nThey stayed watching the child until\
  \ the bell rang, indicating the end of class and an entire hour passed. All the\
  \ while, the little boy had simply sat alone. \n\nSarah turned to say something\
  \ to New and was startled. For the first time, she saw genuine emotion in New\u2019\
  s dark eyes: sadness. Through broken Thai, she attempted to explain to New the importance\
  \ of kindness. \n\n\u201CYou are a clever boy, New,\u201D she said, \u201CHe will\
  \ be too. But sometimes, we all need a friend. Just as I\u2019m your friend.\u201D\
  \ \n\nAnd although Sarah knew they could not understand each other, there was a\
  \ universal language that allowed New to grasp her message without translation.\
  \ \n\nEach schooling day continued the same as the previous, although, there was\
  \ a change. New stopped hitting the other children. He finished his work (still\
  \ fast) with a new pride and effort.\n\nOn her last week, Sarah reflected on her\
  \ experiences. She had fallen in love with the school; with the children running\
  \ around barefoot, the flamboyant kitchen women, the stray dogs that loved to laze\
  \ in the sun. Above all, she did not expect to find a young boy by the name of New,\
  \ who would help her realise that she had fallen in love with being a teacher."
