Text: "It was the final day of my journey, and I planned to spend the afternoon in\
  \ the old medina in Marrakech. My goal-babouche, traditional heelless slippers made\
  \ from soft leather.  They were to be gifts for my family.  \n\nI waited until the\
  \ end of my travels to buy the slippers so that I would not have to carry them around\
  \ Morocco, and now it was time to brave the medina and see how I fared.  I carried\
  \ a list with my family member\u2019s names and shoe sizes.  I researched slipper\
  \ prices, and I decided on a price range I would be satisfied with when bargaining.\
  \  I decided to go with a pleasant but firm approach. \n \nI walked through the\
  \ market the day before to get a sense of its size and scope.  This time I ventured\
  \ off the main route and deeper into the byways of the slipper section before I\
  \ started looking. I moved past the stalls where most foreigners stopped in search\
  \ of one less visited.  I wandered down the passageways until I found a shop which\
  \ caught my attention.  It was a small stall with boxes of slippers neatly stacked\
  \ on shelves floor to ceiling.  At the entrance was a shoe rack with babouche of\
  \ all different colors and styles.  In the center of the stall, a teenage boy sat\
  \ on a stool focused on his mobile phone.  I did not draw his attention until I\
  \ stopped in front of the shoe rack and starting looking at the slippers.  He quickly\
  \ came over and hesitantly spoke in English.  Did I want to buy a pair of slippers?\
  \ I nodded my head, and he handed me several different styles so that I could look\
  \ at them carefully.  When I selected a traditional style with a pointed toe he\
  \ smiled and said \u201CYes?\u201D I smiled in return and said \u201CIf we can make\
  \ a good deal; I would like to pair 13 pairs of different colors and sizes.\u201D\
  \ His eyes grew wide. He held up his hand to excuse himself and quickly made a call\
  \ on his cell phone.  Within minutes his older brother arrived.\n\nThe brother welcomed\
  \ me to the shop.  I handed him the slipper and explained that I wanted to buy thirteen\
  \ pairs if we could agree on a good price, and we set to bargaining.  We discussed\
  \ the quality of the leather and the number of men\u2019s pairs and women\u2019\
  s pairs.  It did not take long to reach an agreement amenable to both of us.  I\
  \ pulled out my list and showed it to Ali, who I learned was 18 years old and running\
  \ the shop with his father and grandfather.  As we discussed colors for each slipper,\
  \ Ahmed, his younger brother, went to the tea shop to get his father and grandfather.\
  \ They quickly arrived with Ahmed bringing a tray of mint tea for all of us.  The\
  \ five of us then spent a delightful hour.  Ali sat next to me and discussed colors\
  \ for each pair.  I pointed to each name on my list and explained who they were\
  \ in my family.  He then spoke in Berber to his father who got the right size and\
  \ color off the wall shelf and handed it to me for approval.\n\nOnce all of the\
  \ slippers were lined up in a row, it was time to make the tassels.  We started\
  \ with my pair. I selected a light green thread to go with my olive green slippers.\
  \  The grandfather nodded and made the tassels, but he looked disappointed.  I decided\
  \ to let him choose the color for the next pair.  He smiled and chose royal blue\
  \ thread to go with the yellow slippers. I thought it an unexpected combination,\
  \ but I realized that it was time to embrace the celebration of color which is part\
  \ of Morocco.  I nodded my assent and from then on let the grandfather suggest color\
  \ combinations.  Purple leather with cream tassels, brown leather with orange tassels,\
  \ and so on until all thirteen pairs were ready to go.  The slippers were not just\
  \ keepsakes, they were a reminder of my time with a local family."
