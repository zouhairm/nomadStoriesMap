Text: "Lisbon, the city of Jos\xE9 Saramago, the golden sunsets and the 7 hills. A\
  \ city, that without neglecting its heritage, welcomes modernism and liberal thinking.\
  \ A city with exquisite cuisine, a lively nightlife and one of the most generous\
  \ climates in Europe.\n\nI arrived one day in spring.  All the book guides indicated\
  \ that it was a warm city, that people who live there have a special shine. And\
  \ Lisbon is synonymous with warmth and friendly people. It is undoubtedly a vibrant\
  \ city.\n\nIts inhabitants have known how to respect the heritage value of their\
  \ city.  Streets with marble-clad floors; decorated houses and plated with tiles;\
  \ doors, and windows carved in painstaking colors highlight, even more, the splendor\
  \ of the city.\n\nIn 5 days, I walked and took pictures tirelessly following tourist\
  \ and culinary routes. There are so many viewpoints that the snapshots would be\
  \ hundreds. It may be the same place but the postcard will be different in the morning\
  \ or during the sunset.\n\nThe twilights are eternal and of a majestic golden. People\
  \ wait for the sunset from the 7 viewpoints. From the Castle of San Jorge, or from\
  \ the edge of the Tagus, the river that embellishes the city even more and makes\
  \ it practically a coastal city. The Tagus flows into the sea, and it is right in\
  \ Lisbon and a few kilometers away that the water reaches the open sea, to the North\
  \ Atlantic.\n\nEnjoying sunsets is a pleasure. But that pleasure of which I speak,\
  \ it is more so if you are on the banks of the Tagus, between the two pillars that\
  \ give the name to the \"door\" of the entrance to the city. The visitors in past\
  \ centuries arrived by boat and entered through this door, named Das Columns, crossed\
  \ the pillars and descended from their ships. Facing the landing, a beautiful square,\
  \ very European, full of history, the famous Pla\xE7a Do Com\xE9rcio.\n\nGastronomy\
  \ is another of the pleasures to which the traveler is exposed.  If there is someone\
  \ who perfectly represents the boom of Lisbon food, it is Jos\xE9 Avillez, a Portuguese\
  \ chef awarded with the famous Michelin stars. With a well-earned prestige, this\
  \ chef has a varied range of restaurants. I visited two of them, Bairro do Avillez\
  \ and Cantinho Do Avillez, restaurants that stand out for the fusion of their creations,\
  \ aroma, and flavors.\n\nIn Bel\xE9m, you have to see its tower, decadent by the\
  \ saltpeter of the sea, but equally beautiful is an iconic postcard and a symbol\
  \ of Manueline architecture. Very close, the Jer\xF3nimos Monastery, a 1501 building\
  \ that commemorated the return of Vasco Da Gama from his trip to India.  Both, the\
  \ facade and its interior are imposing and a reflection of Gothic and Renaissance\
  \ style.\n\nWalking through the city, I was delighted with its streets and balconies\
  \ full of tiles and color. Get lost in the tangled and small ruas of Alfama, Chiado,\
  \ and Bairro Alto.\n\nYou will see reddish roofs that are lost in the blue of the\
  \ Tagus.  Golden sunsets if you go to the twilight time. Points of light if you\
  \ visit them at night. The panorama, usually with the Tagus river in the background,\
  \ makes the crossing exquisite.\n\nFrom the top of the hills of S\xE3o Jorge, S\xE3\
  o Vicente, S\xE3o Roque, Santa Catarina, Chagas or Sant'Anna you will distinguish\
  \ things that you did not see either from below or from the other hills. \n\nTrams\
  \ are another icon. Red, green or yellow, whatever you take are lovely. It is an\
  \ experience, in which many travel guides coincide, going back to the 30s or 40s.\
  \ You will get confused among the locals who are part of the tumult.\n\nI always\
  \ say that the time, however extensive, is short. There is always something more\
  \ to see. You will lack time to eat a typical dish, visit a museum, and go to a\
  \ trendy bar. Or simply return to that viewpoint that you like so much. There will\
  \ always be a lack of time, and this argument is not alien to Lisbon."
