Text: "I took my first trip alone when I was 25 years old, to the mythical Southern\
  \ Chilean island Chiloe. Even if it was winter and a lot of people warned me that\
  \ there was nothing to do at that time, I curiously got on the plane. I had my frist\
  \ regret when getting out of the airport in Puerto Montt: pouring cold rain and\
  \ stormy winds welcomed me.\nAfter a wavy ride on a rickety ferry I was stunned\
  \ to arrive at the island, seeing light green moist meadows paired with dark green\
  \ ferns and coloured huts on pales. My hostel in the town of Ancud could have been\
  \ imagined by Astrid Lindgren: painted in green and yellow, with a German Shepard\
  \ guarding the hallway, smelling like wood and cozy fireplaces. I was the only guest\
  \ and had the big room to myself. I finished the day at 9 pm and tucked myself into\
  \ bed, while the storm whiped the rain against my window. \nThe next morning I unbelievingly\
  \ saw the sun illuminating the little town. In the big hostel kitchen an elderly\
  \ lady prepared toast and eggs. She fit the homely atmosphere with the hissing stove\
  \ and the big wooden furniture.\nMy first tour around the little fishing town revealed\
  \ two things. First: as an 1,78m tall German girl with pale skin an reddish hair\
  \ I was the alien in the town, attracting looks from everyone. But people always\
  \ gave me a warm smile when asked for advice. Second: when traveling alone time\
  \ passes slower! It wasn\u2018t even noon and I had seen everything, the small windy\
  \ roads, the crooked colorful fishing houses, the fortress, the local museum with\
  \ a whale sceleton. My best discovery was a beautiful hidden beach behind the fortress\
  \ mountain from where one could see the sunlight reflected in the grey sea, with\
  \ a glimpse of the Andes at the Chilean mainland at the horizon. I stayed there\
  \ for a while, thinking that sharing that moment with someone would be my biggest\
  \ wish at this moment. \nWhen I continued my stroll through town, I really tried\
  \ to take my time. When I came back to the hostel in the afternoon, two men in their\
  \ mid-thirties had arrived. They were teachers from Santiago who tought a course\
  \ in Ancud for some days. They were busy that evening, but we agreed to have dinner\
  \ the next evening. \nThe next day I went on a trip to the islands capital Castro,\
  \ a small town whose life is completely detemerined by fishing. At the port I watched\
  \ the little boats pass and thought to myself: People here live simple but happy,\
  \ surrounded by wild nature and the sea. \nSuddenly a guy came up next to me and\
  \ poured something out of a bucket down the wall below me. Fish heads and intestines!\
  \ The seagulls around us started screaming and rushed to get the best parts. I fled\
  \ to the nearby market to buy some souvenirs and finished my day with a visit to\
  \ the famous pale-houses in the bay, one painted more beautiful than the other.\n\
  When I came back to Ancud in the evening, the two teachers had invited the Spanish\
  \ woman who worked at the hostel to join us for dinner. In a little cafe we ate\
  \ tuna filled potatoes and I discovered that they were showing the Chilean movie\
  \ \u201ELa once\u201C for free in the community center that night. Afterwards we\
  \ walked through town and talked about life just like old friends. In the next two\
  \ days our mixed group really grew together, telling each other about our experiences.\
  \ I finally felt that I had embraced the calmness of this place, especially as I\
  \ could share those feelings with someone else. Traveling alone is an important\
  \ experience though. \nAt the last day we decided to bake a Banana bread, as a goodbye\
  \ treat. The first thing I did when getting on the bus was to eat my piece of banana\
  \ bread. It was by far the best one I had in my life, so soft and warm. It tasted\
  \ like the perfect roundup for my trip alone that had brought me to this cozy island."
