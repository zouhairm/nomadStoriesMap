Text: "I never thought that close to one of the most poblated cities, i would find\
  \ this place. \nNaples.\nI was travelling with my dad, getting to know Florida,\
  \ we went to Orlando, to the Disney and Universal's parks. It was all great. \n\
  In the middle of the trip, we decided that we wanted to visit another place there,\
  \ and everyone said Naples is good, Naples is quiet, it'll bring you peace. So we\
  \ accepted and went to Naples.\nLittle did we know, that we would find a city full\
  \ of old people, who carried big hearts all around. The beach was amazing, no one\
  \ was shouting or throwing things in the air. All of the houses had these beautiful\
  \ architecture, big gardens, a little bit empty sometimes, but still, so pretty.\
  \ The best thing of Naples, is when the golden hour comes, and everyone just gather\
  \ around the main pier, and see the sun goes down. There you can see families taking\
  \ their photos, couples getting their weddings photoshoot, and graduated kids too.\n\
  The centre of the city is very small, maybe 4/5 blocks with restaurants and some\
  \ shops, nothing more. But you will not need those there, you just need to find\
  \ your hotel, soemthing to eat and relax, let the city calm you down. \nEveryone\
  \ there will probably ask you why are you there, because the city has no atractions,\
  \ except from the pier, and of course, the main reason is knowing more about the\
  \ world, but relaxing is the other one. Either if you come from Miami or the parks,\
  \ this place will help your head rest a little, and focus on the pretty little thing\
  \ in life that surround you.\nMy trip was amazing, but i am sure it's, in grand\
  \ part, for Naples."
