Text: "\u201CWe\u2019ll go in here, and we shall not stop until we find the waterfall.\u201D\
  \ The captain\u2019s gruff voice was full of resolve. The river we were wading up\
  \ had accumulated debris against a tree fallen right across our path and we had\
  \ to make our way through the surrounding forest in order to get upstream to the\
  \ anticipated waterfall. I watched apprehensively as our guide- 80-year-old Captain\
  \ Blake of the ship Four Friends- made his way up the steep muddy bank with nothing\
  \ but his shaking legs and a dead branch he had found. He did not falter. \n\nThe\
  \ rest of the group took turns going up the embankment with each other\u2019s help.\
  \ I had three strong guys pull me up, and even then, I almost fell. My hiking sandals\
  \ had gotten completely caked in mud, as did my calves. It had been an hour of difficult\
  \ splashing through the waist-high water, and now this? The waterfall had better\
  \ be worth it.\n\nYou would think such a gruelling trek would warrant a guaranteed\
  \ cascading paradise waiting for us on the other side. Yet, we were travelling on\
  \ dying optimism (backed by a bit of geographical science). This island had no inhabitants\
  \ and the forest made sure you knew it- it grew fiercely: wild and thick and untamed,\
  \ full of chirping insects and screaming birds. We were in unexplored territory,\
  \ possibly the first to set foot on this route. For every step we took, the ground\
  \ fought back with a branch, a hidden root, scuttling ants. I was tired. We were\
  \ all tired.\n\nWe had launched our canoes from the sailing ship Four Friends we\
  \ were living on earlier in the morning and had pulled up onto an extremely rocky\
  \ beach. The mouth of the river was hidden high above us; the water trickled down\
  \ through limestone rocks to reach the sea. We had clambered up a 45-degree incline\
  \ of rocks, then abseiled down the steep adjacent side to the river bed. It was\
  \ lucky we had brought ropes. The gleam of excitement was in our white-haired captain\u2019\
  s eyes. \u201CYou are never too old to explore,\u201D he had declared dramatically\
  \ as he successfully made it down to the river mouth. My 23-year-old self had agreed,\
  \ although who knows what 80-year-old me would think.\n\nThe sun was high in the\
  \ sky as we weaved through the forest, keeping parallel to the meandering river.\
  \ We eventually managed to get back down to the water to continue the trek- it was\
  \ no easier walking on the slippery rocky bottom but at least it was cooler. We\
  \ had been moving mostly in silence- having needed utmost concentration to not fall\
  \ and die in the thick of this deserted, desolated, mess of trees- until someone\
  \ at the front of the group suddenly gave a yell.\n\nThere it was, right in front\
  \ of our eyes. The majestic waterfall we had trekked 3 hours to see. The 7 of us\
  \ and Captain stood there, quietly contemplating the sight before us. \n\n\u201C\
  I am NOT going further.\u201D There was disappointment in my voice as I looked at\
  \ the pathetic 1-meter high \u201Cwaterfall\u201D, tumbling down gently into a small\
  \ wading pool. All of us were tired out, and it looked like there was nothing bigger\
  \ up ahead that we could find in the next couple of hours. My statement met with\
  \ no protests. I shrugged and splashed my way into the wading pool, which was deep\
  \ enough that I could not stand at some parts. The others joined me, while the captain\
  \ sprawled out on some big rocks and started unpacking our loaf and spreads for\
  \ lunch.\n\nJust then, the wind blew and the thick branches above us rustled. Sunlight\
  \ streamed through, sparkling like jewels on the water\u2019s surface. I had been\
  \ in the middle of trying to light a semi-wet cigar, but I froze. We all looked\
  \ in awe as the pool around us glittered. Raw joy bubbled up in my throat, and before\
  \ long, we were all laughing. Splashing around in a sunlit pool with friends, with\
  \ the rushing of water in our ears and the pristine forest around us, I finally\
  \ understood the joy of exploration."
