Text: "I\u2019ve just finished eating breakfast at a local\u2019s spot. Had a green\
  \ smoothie with nopal in it (the cactus adorning the Mexican flag) and some incredibly\
  \ good pozole. I get out of the restaurant only to find my car keys hanging from\
  \ the door of my Toyota \u201990 pickup. I check inside and everything is where\
  \ it was, including my DSLR camera which I was too distracted to hide. My friend,\
  \ an American on a sabbatical year, teases me. \nI smile at my mistake, the thought\
  \ comes to me when two months ago, crossing the border between San Diego and Tijuana,\
  \ I was panicking at the idea of parking in the legendary city and walk back to\
  \ the border to get my passport stamped. The immigration officers of both the US\
  \ and Mexico hadn\u2019t even bothered to stop me as I drove through. My distress\
  \ still now seems understandable though, this border is the largest in the world\
  \ and an average of almost one hundred thousand people cross it daily.\nThe fear\
  \ I had of Mexico seems so remote now. Baja California has shown me how distant\
  \ is reality when compared to any Hollywood action movie where Mexico plays a part\
  \ in. Except for the never-ending desertic landscapes (yet no narcos drive through\
  \ them), the tinted vehicles (natural due to the intense heat of the desert) and\
  \ the world renowned Mexican food (everywhere to be eaten); Baja California has\
  \ instead presented itself as a natural paradise.\nWe\u2019ve driven off from the\
  \ restaurant by now and are parking on a gorgeous beach at the Northern side of\
  \ the Sea of Cortez. It\u2019s only a matter of time-I know-before I see some spectacular\
  \ dolphins or whale sharks swim by the shore. Jacques Cousteau once entitled this\
  \ sea as \u201Cthe world\u2019s aquarium\u201D, and I\u2019d be foolish if I disagreed:\
  \ Every variety of sea specimen seems to be found here, and only in Southern Chile\
  \ have I been able to find seafood in these quantities. \nNo one is around us but\
  \ an RV in the distance, surely owned by some retired Americans or a European couple\
  \ overlanding this hidden jewel of the Western Hemisphere. It\u2019s California,\
  \ Mexican California, and there are no traces of real-estate development, industry\
  \ or strip centers. To the east, the calm turquoise waters of the Sea of Cortez\
  \ bathe the dessert. To the West, the rugged waters of the Pacific crash against\
  \ desolate beaches were adventure seeking surfers from around the world catch wave\
  \ after wave with little to no queue lines. Over there, where the endless Pacific\
  \ bursts against the land, if you keep an eye in the distance at this time of the\
  \ year, undoubtedly you\u2019ll find a grey whale jump and release vapor up its\
  \ blowhole.\nAs the sun hides between the mountains I help my friend collect some\
  \ wood. He has abandoned life in Ohio and his office job to pursue a life \"more\
  \ in touch with nature\". We've been having fires by the beach every night for a\
  \ week already and he must surely feel satisfied.\nAs the wood of dead cacti begin\
  \ to crackle and the stars start to come out over us I immerse in my own thoughts.\
  \ In a few days, with the end of Winter, I will be crossing back into San Diego.\
  \ Western Civilization will come roaring through my senses once again. I will be\
  \ happy though, untouched wilderness I\u2019ve only experienced in the Himalayas\
  \ and Patagonia is only a league away from the US and is defiantly showing how strong\
  \ the force of nature still is... and how easy it is to get there and discover it."
