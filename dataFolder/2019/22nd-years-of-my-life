Text: "Years differ and What you do depends on what is happening at that particular\
  \ time. Being born, intelligent, free , gay and diligent opened the adventures side\
  \ of me. Yes, that's right. \n\nBeing free and easy to connect with people from\
  \ different background and most importantly different personalities became the most\
  \ amazing gift of in my life. And that makes me who i am today.\n\nI was turning\
  \ 22 Year on the 7th Jan which i decided to celebrate and thank my body for surviving\
  \ all things in my life. Kwa-Zulu Natal, Durban was the best place for me to meet\
  \ new people, learn their culture and enjoy what durban has for people from different\
  \ places. I meet people whom now I'm friends with and other the allowed me to enjoy\
  \ my stay in durban. I went to durban when i still young i could understand nor\
  \ feel the way i was feeling at my second visit. I went to places that i wished\
  \ i could go, the hotel was amazing, the beach was something else and the people.\
  \ Why am i not mentioning the food? They were delicious and tasteful. The India\
  \ touch and newly invented recipes at the restaurants thereci just awesome.\n\n\
  \ Everything was perfect and how i expected things to go it did. This was the best\
  \ gift I've ever given to my self. Before i forget the Dolphis and Seal at the Ushaka\
  \ Marine World i was fantastic. The education through that performance was great\
  \ and the funny things that those animals did was hilarious.\n\nTravel and visiting\
  \ places and connecting with other people from different environment is a wonderful\
  \ activity nor adventurous thing to do. Ever! But that comes with working hard in\
  \ order to achieve you wishes, goals and promises.\n\nThat was the best way to celebrate\
  \ twenty two years of my life and discovering new essence of happiness and life."
