Text: "I've always been a fan of travel blogs, videos, documentaries and articles.\
  \ It is very common to read or see about how someone left everything behind and\
  \ traveled with only a backpack through Asia or Europe. Going to India, Hawaii or\
  \ Thailand, all of these places are ideal to me. We've all dreamed about this life\
  \ altering trip to far away lands that many times seems like just a fantasy, but,\
  \ my experience with a travel that changed my world perspective, my passion and\
  \ helped me understand more about life cycles, opportunities and taking risks. This\
  \ travel was a in-country trip with my family to Boquete, Chiriqui. \n\nBoquete\
  \ is a region that is famous for it's coffee and their weather, very different from\
  \ the rest of Panama. During my stay in Boquete, I had the opportunity to stay in\
  \ Finca Lerida, where we took a coffee tour where we saw the different stages of\
  \ the harvest, from the planting of the seeds and choosing the right field to the\
  \ very end where they pick every single bean for better taste, aroma and body. Here\
  \ we tasted Geisha Coffee, a variation of coffee that is light and aromatic, so\
  \ coveted that one pound sold for $803, a record-breaking sale. Given my curious\
  \ nature I asked the tour guide if global warming could affect them somehow and\
  \ he said that yes, that coffee needs specific conditions in order to grow.  \n\n\
  I am not a local to Boquete, but I am panamanian and it took me such a long time\
  \ to appreciate how our land is blessed with nutrients that are unique and valuable,\
  \ resources that we are taking for granted.  I came home with a new passion, both\
  \ for coffee and for conserving our planet. I began to actively look for ways of\
  \ reducing my carbon footprint, with then brought me to apply to an internship with\
  \ an international organization that focuses on green supply chains and changed\
  \ the way I look at food. \n\nSometimes we expect that this huge, far trip will\
  \ change our lives, but, sometimes the small travels that are filled with information\
  \ and love can make a big difference. I know, because, this trip changed all of\
  \ my mindsets and it made me a better a person, someone with a purpose.  So next\
  \ time when you have a trip to a country that is near yours, a short trip to your\
  \ own region, keep an open mindset, because you never know when travel will inspire\
  \ you to become a better person."
