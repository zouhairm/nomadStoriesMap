Text: "An eclectic gem just outside of the city, Parys in the Free State province\
  \ of South Africa is the perfect day trip if you're getting tired of the city vibe.\
  \ With a thirst to explore, the fianc\xE9 and I poured into our tiny car, the only\
  \ trouble along the way that we'd forgotten to withdraw money for the tollbooths.\
  \ Travelling through idyllic farmlands and tree-pecked country, we were soothed\
  \ by the cloudy January weather and the peace that came with soon being one of the\
  \ only cars on the road.\n         I'd once driven through Parys as a child with\
  \ my parents, on the way to a family gathering, and the memory left me feeling apprehensive\
  \ as I remembered it being thoroughly drab and definitely not worth a second look.\
  \ I was pleasantly surprised then, to find that the town had changed in the ten\
  \ years since I'd last been there, with antique shops, hipster restaurants, and\
  \ various other unique little alleyways to investigate with pleasure.\n        \
  \   We spent the first half of the morning rummaging through various antique/furniture\
  \ shops down the main street. These are a treasure for anyone with a sense of old\
  \ timey elegance with items ranging from restored furniture, second hand books,\
  \ and grandma's old Elvis Presley records. Heading back the way we came, just on\
  \ the edge of the highway towards Jozi, a true sight is the Bon-Af Berry farm, where\
  \ you can pay to pick and eat a variety of blackberries, blueberries, gojiberries,\
  \ and raspberries, paying a measly R170 a kilo for the berries you hadn't munched\
  \ on. If you have the need to bond with your travel buddy, nothing does it like\
  \ trying to beat the other patrons to the juiciest blackberry on the bush.\n   \
  \       Heading back into town for lunch, we parked on the end of the restaurant\
  \ district, deciding to explore more before sitting down to sample the cuisine.\
  \ I managed to find an iron-engraved ringbox for the wedding in a knick-shop just\
  \ across from the town's famous photography shop. There, you can pay to have a family\
  \ portrait taken in sepia, while wearing old boer clothing. In an alley, aptly named\
  \ Le Petit Paris, we discovered several handmade clothing shopss, handmade chocolate\
  \ and gelato, and a lovely salon for the ladies.\n         We had lunch at The Plum\
  \ Tree, with a delicious meal of open sandwhiches (two slices of brown bread packed\
  \ with your choice of fillings and left exposed) and homemade lemonade. The atmosphere\
  \ delighted with a high school orchestra of friends playing violins and drums on\
  \ the pavement outside, while patrons relaxed and chatted the day away.\n      \
  \    While the weather cleared up on our way home, the louds did not harm our judgement\
  \ of this beautiful town. This new experience just goes to show that first impressions\
  \ are not lasting, and it's no surprise that Parys will see our faces again soon."
