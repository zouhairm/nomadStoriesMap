Text: "Welcome to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta. The weather is\
  \ 28, it\u2019s\npartly cloudy currently. There is no time difference between Jakarta\
  \ and Surabaya. We hope to see you again soon, and we hope you enjoyed your flight.\n\
  \nMy name is Dinda, a petite girl with a big heart and an even bigger dream. I have\
  \ heard these words for a countless time in my whole life whenever the plane was\
  \ landed, but this one made me feel like I was struck by lightning. I realize that\
  \ this time is different. This time, I\u2019m starting over.\n\nI took a deep breath\
  \ as I took that one leap of faith and realizing what Neil Armstrong meant when\
  \ he said \u201CThat's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201D\
  \ it certainly felt that way.\nGrowing up in Surabaya, it is a place I will always\
  \ call home, even though I\u2019ve wanted to get out from there for so long. I\u2019\
  ve always thought that too much of anything is too much, including comfort. There,\
  \ in Surabaya, I can always feel safe and sound. Almost like nothing bad will ever\
  \ happen in my life because I have people who will always support me and welcome\
  \ me back with open arms in my bad days.\n\nI was way out of the world, deep inside\
  \ my clouded mind when I noticed my luggage have arrived. I took my things and walk\
  \ slowly with uncountable burdens in my heart and all the dreams I have in mind.\
  \ My body trembled slightly as I was waiting for the taxi. Is this the right choice?\
  \ I keep asking myself. Am I doing something right that will take me further and\
  \ further into the real world? Is this an act of bravery for trying to let go of\
  \ the shackles that were wrapped around me in my whole life? Or is this actually\
  \ an act of cowardice in disguise for running away from the life I have built for\
  \ years because I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the result and my status quo?\n\nTwenty\
  \ months have passed me by, and I still haven\u2019t found the answers to my questions,\
  \ but if there\u2019s one thing I can recall perfectly, it\u2019s the suffocating\
  \ feeling I felt when I first landed my feet on this city. I was crossing the main\
  \ road of Depok named Jalan Margonda Raya by the pedestrian bridge, with half of\
  \ my heart left in my home and the other half coping here trying to give me strength,\
  \ there were two girls selling toys and a sight of a boy that broke my heart and\
  \ soul. He was around 10, sleeping with one hand hugging his legs and the other\
  \ one embracing his clown-mask. The humid and the heat of this suburb of Jakarta\
  \ didn\u2019t make him backed down to even do the slightest change as in changing\
  \ his clown costume, he was still wearing that big, fluffy and thick costume to\
  \ sleep on the edge of the pedestrian bridge. He only bothered to take off his clown\
  \ mask. I couldn\u2019t stop the tears from falling from my eyes. \n\nThe uneven\
  \ development slapped me right in the face. The sight I never saw back home. At\
  \ that moment, I realized the pain I felt was nothing compared to the boy in the\
  \ clown costume. Now I know, I did not come this far to only be this person I am\
  \ now. It was one hardest slap I have ever faced in my whole life and I intended\
  \ to never have to face it ever again. I want people to realize that there\u2019\
  s a hope after all. That there are dreams we can dream, that there are endless opportunities\
  \ here and there. Starting over in a new place is frightening and there is nothing\
  \ guaranteed. One thing for certain, life is full of choices, and I chose this unknown\
  \ leap of faith.\n\nAs I was writing this, I felt the enormous longing for my home\
  \ and there was a song repeated in my head.\nRivers and roads, rivers and roads,\
  \ rivers til I reach you."
