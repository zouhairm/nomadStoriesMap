Text: "The woman in seat 21D, whose right elbow skimmed my left, introduced herself\
  \ as Leila. But as I\u2019d later learn, that name was only a formality. Those who\
  \ know her and adore her\u200A\u2014\u200Awhich, as it turns out, is an entire village\u200A\
  \u2014\u200Aall call her Nana.\n\nWe shared the same flight to Lombok from Bali,\
  \ but that was our only mutuality. Bound by no more than my return ticket to the\
  \ Island of the Gods and a scant hostel deposit, I planned to explore the backpacker-friendly\
  \ area of Kuta, located at the austral end of the island. She, a long-time resident\
  \ of Lombok, was headed to her parents\u2019 home at its rural, untrodden center.\
  \ \n\nI was halfway through an in-flight magazine article about Eid al-Fitr when\
  \ her voice cut through the silence. \u201CHow long are you here for?\u201D An innocent\
  \ question, one I\u2019d answered many times already. \u201CJust around a week,\u201D\
  \ I replied. \u201CI figured I\u2019d head to Kuta and hike Mount Rinjani afterward.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CMmm,\u201D she replied, sagely nodding. Her eyes closed behind black-framed\
  \ glasses and she rested her head on the seat\u2014a coda that, seemingly, marked\
  \ the end of our cursory conversation. But then, startled by a sudden burst of inspiration,\
  \ she turned to me, eyes wide open. And in a single, run-on breath: \u201CMy son\
  \ is a Rinjani guide. He could take you. Do you have plans in Kuta already? If not,\
  \ come with me to my parents\u2019 home. The house is in the countryside; much better\
  \ than Kuta. You\u2019ll like it. And you can meet my son.\u201D \n\nTwo hours and\
  \ a bumpy car ride later, that\u2019s where I found myself, with a small cup of\
  \ homemade rice wine in hand and a stunning window view before me. Nana\u2019s childhood\
  \ abode stretched out over a wide swath of land at the crest of a hill, offering\
  \ the sweeping vistas below as a gift for visitors like myself.\n\nWhen my fingers\
  \ weren\u2019t curled around a mug, they were still occupied\u200A\u2014\u200Awith\
  \ a fork, for gorging myself on the seasoned beef, halved duck eggs, steaming bowls\
  \ of rice, and other fare Nana\u2019s mother had prepared; and extended outward,\
  \ to greet the numerous friends, neighbors, and relatives of Nana\u2019s who had\
  \ flocked to her porch upon the news of her return. Whereas I had left my familiar\
  \ and familial comforts only a few days prior, she\u2019d been away from hers for\
  \ quite awhile. \n\nIt took little time before I realized that here, the notion\
  \ of family extends far beyond blood relations. Nana, in fact, doesn\u2019t have\
  \ any biological children. Yet she introduced \u201Cmy son\u201D (who is actually\
  \ that of her longtime friend) with unquestionable certitude. With every new arrival,\
  \ she welcomed them with a prolonged, almost maternal embrace. And through the blended\
  \ exchanges of Bahasa Indonesian and English that I struggled to follow, the word\
  \ \u2018Nana\u2019\u2014spoken frequently, and with joy\u2014required no translation.\n\
  \nWhen crumbs and empty glasses were all that remained, Nana turned to me. \u201C\
  See, isn\u2019t this better than Kuta?\u201D she asked. She poured me another glass\
  \ of rice wine, making no attempt to hide a smug smile. \n\nI didn\u2019t have to\
  \ answer. She, a stranger on the plane only a few hours earlier, already knew that\
  \ she was right. One could say that it was a mother\u2019s instinct."
