Text: "It was nothing I'd seen before. The deep blue but yet so light ocean was shining\
  \ in the sunlight, and made the already mesmerizing seen even more so. I could hear\
  \ the port of the old town Side come alive. All the ships and the people coming\
  \ and going. The whole city was just beautiful. And now after all this time, thousands\
  \ of years later, it was even more beautiful to me. You could touch the stones of\
  \ a former guard tower or stand on a very high city wall, watching the ocean line.\
  \ And to think that someone else had touched the same stones, or even built this\
  \ city from these stones, all that time ago.\n   I closed my eyes to get away from\
  \ all the tourists and the advertisement. It made the place so much less than it\
  \ was in reality. I had bought a map that showed the old town and it's buildings\
  \ in its former glory. I imagined the town as it once was. So different from now.\
  \ The teather was just a piece of what it had been. So was the temple and the great\
  \ city wall.\n   I opened my eyes and in front of me there was this long pillar.\
  \ Every tourist took a picture with it. It was a part of the once so magnificent\
  \ temple of Apollo, the Greek god of healing and music. I had to take the picture\
  \ too, of course.\n   After taking multiple pictures with the remaining parts of\
  \ the temple, I stopped filming and I just touched the stone made element. The cracks\
  \ and little holes of the stone made sure the pillars story was been told. All the\
  \ thing this stone had seen standing right here on the edge of the ocean. All the\
  \ people who had touched this very stone. And everything this temple had went through\
  \ trying to simply keep standing.\n   This stone might have been part of a temple\
  \ once, but now it was a part of history. Because before becoming a part of a pillar\
  \ of a temple, this stone was part of this earth we stand on. This made me melancholy.\n\
  \   I suddenly understood how young I was myself. I wasn't thousands of years old\
  \ pillar of a temple. I was just that stone material, waiting to be sculptured in\
  \ to something some day. Waiting for something to change my life. And here it was.\
  \ A thousands of years old stone pillar, waiting for me to find it. And now that\
  \ I had, I knew what I had to do.\n   When the trip was over, I returned to home\
  \ in Lapland, Finland. The weather was colder than I remembered, and my car didn't\
  \ start at all. It had stood there too long waiting for me to come home, and it\
  \ had frozen.\n   The pillars I touched in old Side were much older and had went\
  \ through a lot more. The temple was made by human as was this car of mine. But\
  \ something was different, the car stopped working and broke. But in the same time,\
  \ the pillars of the temple of Apollo still stood there waiting for to change someone\
  \ else's life as well. I knew I had to see more.\n   The family trip to the warm\
  \ and sunny city of Side changed something in me. Now I knew I had to create something\
  \ as permanent and magnificent as the teple ruins I had touched in Turkey. I didn't\
  \ expect to find anything this amazing and important on my trip, that was supposed\
  \ to be just a basic holiday. Yet, the history often repeats itself.\n   To be something\
  \ great and strong, you have to know what greatness and strongness looks like. To\
  \ create something as unforgettable as this stone made landmark, you have to learn\
  \ about the history. I decided to start traveling the great monuments of the human\
  \ history. The adventure of my life has begun!"
