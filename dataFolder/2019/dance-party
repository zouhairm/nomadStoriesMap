Text: "On a whim I decided to purchase Valentine\u2019s Day tickets to Beirut. I was\
  \ staying in Istanbul and I was feeling antsy and eager to fly further into the\
  \ East to see what it would offer. It just so happened that the Middle East\u2019\
  s most popular and perhaps only queer band, Mashrou Leila, were having a show in\
  \ their home city of Beirut. I had been listening to Mashrou Leila since my first\
  \ year of college and admired the music they made that flawlessly blended their\
  \ Arab and queer identity. For so long, I had struggled with the notion of having\
  \ a hyphenated identity that encapsulated me. I struggled to fit in with both sides\
  \ of myself, and despite learning to navigate both spaces separately, I wanted to\
  \ understand how I could be both Muslim and queer simultaneously. Despite not understanding\
  \ the majority of the lyrics, their music moved me and in turn I was moved to go\
  \ to Beirut to see if I could figure out the complexity of containing multitudes.\
  \ \n\nI got to the venue too early and walked into an almost completely empty space.\
  \ While waiting up in the front row, I ran out of internet that I had hastily purchased\
  \ at the airport. Without the internet to distract me, I thought about how being\
  \ both Muslim and queer in America leaves very few places where I can meet and interact\
  \ with others also occupying this small niche. Too often I am the token person who\
  \ checks all these boxes, forced by default to represent a group of people I have\
  \ no right representing. As the lights dimmed and I waited, listening to the chattering\
  \ of simultaneous French and Arabic around me, I realized I was in a sea of queer\
  \ Arab kids. They were beautiful, even the ones splashing beer on my shoes as we\
  \ danced. They were embracing and laughing and dancing with abandon. I realized\
  \ a very big void was being filled for me. I was in a space where everybody was\
  \ like me, and unlike me, totally different but still of the same tribe. I couldn\u2019\
  t communicate with many people, but music is a universal language and Mashrou Leila\
  \ know how to put on a good dance party. \n\nTowards the end of the show, I started\
  \ talking to three girls who wondered why I was alone. They didn\u2019t even wait\
  \ for me to finish answering before they handed me a cigarette. I hadn\u2019t realized\
  \ that I was desperately craving one and it was a sign of solidarity, a hand hold\
  \ when you\u2019re all alone in a large crowd but you\u2019re not lonely. As the\
  \ dance party ended and everyone started shuffling out, one of the girls, Corine,\
  \ asked me how I was getting back to where I was staying. I realized I had run out\
  \ of internet and couldn\u2019t call an Uber for myself. She grabbed my hand and\
  \ told me to wait while she called a number. Several minutes of rapid back and forth\
  \ in Arabic with a pause to ask me where I was staying, she had procured a cab for\
  \ me. She waited with me and we talked about music and queerness and she tried to\
  \ teach me a few things in French, to no prevail. \n\nOn the cab ride home, she\
  \ accompanied me so I wouldn\u2019t get lost and held my hand tight. She walked\
  \ me to the front door of the hostel and promised we would meet again. I never saw\
  \ her again, and I\u2019m not sure if I ever will but I think about her kindness\
  \ often. I think about her openness to help a complete stranger have a good night\
  \ and get home safe. That night, I felt seen and validated in a way I had never\
  \ before and I knew being Arab and queer meant having a community on the other side\
  \ of the world that would dance with you."
