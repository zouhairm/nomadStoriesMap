Text: "Born in India, i moved away from India really quick at about the age of four,\
  \ was bought up in the Middle East mainly in Dubai for the next 14 years of my life.\
  \ lifestyle traits that came with being a school kid in Dubai was a significant\
  \ part of how different I was when I travelled back to India for my college degree.\
  \ It\u2019s been almost 5 years since I moved to India and It was surely a sharp\
  \ change considering Dubai being the most developed concrete jungle and international\
  \ trade hub to India being full of colors and cultures on people. Both countries\
  \ cannot be described in one sentence Ofcourse. Dubai is an internationally multicultural\
  \ place with people from across the world bringing plenty variety of food, clothing,\
  \ languages, lifestyles making your senses explode every time you enter a different\
  \ restaurant or a shopping mall. India being remarkably similar with differences\
  \ keeping in mind that the country has a new culture Every 20 Kms in India. Having\
  \ travelled to almost 21 states in India its hard to express the the uncanny similarities\
  \ between the citizens yet have their cultural differences in clothing and food\
  \ and language and dialects. Festivals and celebrations cannot go unoticed in the\
  \ two countries I\u2019ve been in, everybody makes you take part in the moment.\
  \ India celebrates about 59 festivals in a year. heavy monsoons and bearable heat\
  \ in South India makes it a pleasant place to visit throughout the year, diverse\
  \ wildlife will make you want to stay longer on a short vacation , although there\
  \ are no fancy restaurants there are different types of food to try along the way,\
  \ but if you want to experience heavy rains then north east India is a must visit\
  \ site. The north of India has a strong Historical background similar to that found\
  \ in every state of the country as all states hold a strong image of the past. To\
  \ have lived in both countries I have to say I\u2019ve learnt to adapt to conditions\
  \ of the region considering heat waves in Dubai that sometimes touch 50 degrees\
  \ Celsius. And also with the food and people in India. Although adaptation is necessary\
  \ for living, while visiting for a vacation or short time I don\u2019t think that\u2019\
  s heavily necessary. This would sound way better if I had a podcast *laugh out loud*\
  \ but the point I had to make here is I can write now it\u2019s upto the judges.\
  \ *fingers crossed*"
