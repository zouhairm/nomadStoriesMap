Text: "Snow covering forests\nMirrored on the Lake Biwa\nCrystal white and flawless\n\
  The mountains of Shiga\n\n\tI was living in Kyoto, a place in which snow is like\
  \ something very impossible to see even in the winter. Sometimes snow falls, but\
  \ it will melt in hours. I had never seen snow in my life since I came to Japan,\
  \ never. That white and hexagonal thing was just like something magical for me,\
  \ people who used to live in the equator.  That is why I was there, sitting in a\
  \ loop-train to Shiga. \n\tI sat nearby the window, in the left side of the train.\
  \ The temperature was getting colder as the steel carriage heading up to the mountains.\
  \ The contrast of warm air inside the train and outside created condensations. I\
  \ wept the window with my left hand. I was so surprised that the scenery has already\
  \ changed from windows of Japanese apartments into a lot of white-coated mountains.\
  \ There are four or five mountains, tops of them are all white. Interestingly, their\
  \ bottoms are all still green, filled with young trees retaining their leaves, battling\
  \ against the winter cold. I was amazed by the scenery, the truly beauty of \u96EA\
  \u5316\u7CA7\u3057\u305F\u5C71. I looked at the right side of the train. A breathtaking\
  \ landscape of Lake Biwa\u2014the biggest lake in Japan was coming out into me.\
  \ I could not wait to get off.\n\tI put both of my arms and hugged my body when\
  \ the cold air went inside the train. I stepped out my feet outside to go into the\
  \ nearby bus shelter. There is a free yellow commuter bus for going closer to the\
  \ mountain. Again, I sat nearby a big window of the vehicle, looking out of it and\
  \ saw a little snow under a young green tree. The snow was gray, mixed with dirt\
  \ and mud. As the bus was heading up the hill, more piles of white snow were seen.\
  \ As the bus was going up, the amounts of snow kept increasing until the soil was\
  \ all white, covered with snow. \n\tI got off, looking at all completely white trees,\
  \ houses, and hills. In front of me, the mountains of Shiga were all really close,\
  \ coated with snow. I lined for a gondola ticket, going to a ski resort in the top\
  \ of the mountain. The ticket officer passed me a ticket, for I gave her a thousand\
  \ yen (USD 8.98). After ten minutes, a tall Japanese officer with very pale skin\
  \ let me go inside the gondola. \nThe gondola moved and sometimes shook gently as\
  \ the wind kept hitting its body. It has very big windows so that I could see all\
  \ white pines trees below my feet. I could see the Lake Biwa, its surface looked\
  \ silver as the afternoon sunshine was reflected on it. From the right side, I could\
  \ see forests on the hills, covered with white snow. The gondola kept heading to\
  \ one of the mountain peaks. I wonder what was behind that big white peak.\n\tVast\
  \ piles of snow welcomed me as I stepped outside the gondola. I looked on my feet,\
  \ realizing that it was a bad decision to wear a pair of nine-centimeter-heeled\
  \ boots in this kind of weather. Well, I just did not expect that the snow would\
  \ have piled that much. I continued to walk carefully. Every time I pulled up my\
  \ feet, a pair of big traces left. I was enticed to make more and more traces, run\
  \ around, and make some big circles of footprints. I kept walking around until I\
  \ arrived in front of a frozen ravine. I tried to look down, the Lake Biwa was seen\
  \ from there. Its surface met the horizon, surrounded by other small hills and cloudy\
  \ skies. Some kaitsuburi were swimming merrily on it, making small quacking sounds\
  \ that could be heard from miles. I closed my eyes and felt every sensation of winter.\
  \ Cold and calm, in a beautiful moment of serendipity. I could not wait to go back,\
  \ to the mountains of Shiga.\n\nShiga\t\t: A prefecture in the West side of Kyoto\
