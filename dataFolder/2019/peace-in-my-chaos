Text: 'In today''s world we tend to think every thing is at our reach we can do anything,
  but that''s not the case, I came to know this when I met her.

  It was in the month of June or July 6 years back while, she was my senior in college
  one day we happened to get down in same bus stop, there was something when pulled
  me towards her, who knew that one step which I took towards her would change me
  so much.. I spoke to her she was polite to me, that instant I couldn''t exactly
  know what happened to me but I felt peace with all the comotion going on in me,
  She never should me extra affection she was normal yet with me telling a word she
  could tell what I was going through, it really shook me how she could see me! Days
  passed by eventually she passed out of college and there was no contact.. One day
  again I saw her near my house speaking with some one, without me knowing my legs
  starting moving towards her.. I spoke to her again and felt that same peace which
  I had lost all these days.. This time lucky me I have the opportunity to be with
  her for longer time, I studied with her there were long night talks on the subjects
  which I didn''t dare to speak with rest of the world, it mesmerizes me how she can
  understand me so well, she knows me in and out, i cannot fake myself in front of
  her even if I wished. she makes me realise that there are things which are not to
  be analysed but to be felt things beyond are sense of analysis. A connection of
  soul. And so It seems I''ve finally found my home, place where there is peace in
  the chaos.'
