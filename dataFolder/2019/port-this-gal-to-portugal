Text: "Traveling is like food for soul for me! It takes off all your envies, jealousies,\
  \ unforgiveness, selfishness and fears. You can leave your footprints and take back\
  \ good memories and experiences.\nTraveling in my own country feels like roaming\
  \ in your own comfort zone. India's diversity and culture is not something to be\
  \ described in words, rather it is something to be experienced yourself.\nRecently\
  \ on my trip to Goa, I explored a new serene & beautiful side of this place which\
  \ is culturally enriched with an eclectic mix of Portuguese heritage, wonderful\
  \ climate, glorious beaches & exotic food.\n There's so much to learn and explore\
  \ from heritage homes that lets you stay in and feel the blissful surroundings.\n\
  A paradise for Seafood lovers, you get everything fresh infused with the plethora\
  \ of aromatic spices. The best way to experience is food along the beach in one\
  \ of the so many available shoreline shacks.\nA place in contrast, Goa offers both\
  \ the ultimate party paradise & peace and tranquility on the other hand. \nStaying\
  \ close to Anjuna village which is in the Bardez Taluka of North Goa district of\
  \ Goa State, we could experience a varied cultural difference. Bardez Taluka has\
  \ the Mandovi River on the southern side and the Chapora River on the northern side,\
  \ and the Arabian Sea on the west demarcating the boundary.\nYou get completely\
  \ wooed away seeing people selling bohemian clothes, jewelry, tea, spices, old Saris\
  \ and handmade items.\n\nThe river Chapora flows with an abandon towards the sea.\
  \ The sea comes forward with all its enthusiasm to receive it. Nested between a\
  \ hill and a beach, one can never get tired looking at this confluence. No wonder\
  \ our ancient scriptures say so much about these places.\nMy favorite activity though\
  \ was walking on the beach listening to the waves as they passionately meet the\
  \ shore.\nArtjuna is an experience caf\xE9 in an old Goan house. It has a Yoga studio,\
  \ a curated gift or souvenir shop, and a lovely open-air restaurant. The hippie\
  \ style yoga posters juxtapose with the giant Nataraja in brass. The recycled tyres\
  \ make a good decoration next to the copper vessel for drinking water. Perfect place\
  \ for a delicious meal & relax. Even has a sand pit for kids to play and have fun.\n\
  Goa is home to some very unique festivals. Think of a mud festival in the middle\
  \ of heavy monsoon season or a festival where cucumbers rule.\nSerendipity Art Festival\
  \ is  my favourite though it is a relatively new celebration but a state of the\
  \ art festival held in Panjim. Various venues turn into art galleries, new public\
  \ art gets installed. Artists from various fields like performing arts, culinary\
  \ arts etc get a platform to showcase their work.\nGoa offers you a relaxing vacation\
  \ with quiet luxury and a charming ambience created with eco friendly practices.\
  \ It is great city to walk around and explore the hills, greens and bay around.\
  \ \nMake sure you plan your trip soon..I am sure once experience this place, you\
  \ would want to come again and again to this paradise on earth."
