Text: "I live for these moments. These simple, candid moments that soften the rougher\
  \ edges of life, like when the sun is peering through the glass of Kolkata Station\
  \ and I feel like it's painting me gold.\n\nThe morning rituals feel like fading\
  \ memories, now. I devoted the past hour or so to photographing and canvassing indignant\
  \ Indian women protesting against the sentences of the five men responsible for\
  \ the gang-rape of a young and loved local girl. My throat is parched, so I stroll\
  \ into a shop adjacent to the station to purchase a water bottle and samosas.\n\n\
  I owe the shopkeeper 85 rupees in total, and I sheepishly hand him two-hundred.\n\
  \n\"You no need change?\" he queries, smiling coyly.\n\n\"It's alright. Keep the\
  \ change,\" I reply. He hands me two worn fifty-rupee and ten-rupee notes, and five\
  \ Werther's Original caramel chews, each one valued at a single rupee.\n\nAround\
  \ here, small change poses a huge problem. So, such an exchange is an element of\
  \ daily life. It is an exchange I have grown accustomed to, and one that I have\
  \ grown to adore. I safeguard little denominations of fives, tens, and twenties\
  \ like they're the gold slips to Wonka's Chocolate factory while I scramble to relieve\
  \ my pockets of the larger notes as quickly as I can. I flinch a bit when I'm forced\
  \ to present shopkeepers with two-hundred rupee notes, who often scowl at them as\
  \ if the money is really more trouble than it's worth.\n\nAs the tram to East Kolkata\
  \ arrives, I secure the caramel chews in my knapsack. I locate a seat and unwind\
  \ for a bit while waiting for the ticket inspector to gather the toll.\n\n\u201C\
  Five-rupee. Exact only,\" he demands.\n\nBear in mind, I've no five-rupee notes\u2014\
  a direct result of my previous exchange. I meekly present a fifty rupees, my head\
  \ bowed apologetically.\n\nA boy standing beside me hands the conductor two five-rupee\
  \ notes, compensating for both our fares. He chuckles and whispers, \"Tram's awfully\
  \ pricey, I'll say.\"\n\nIt only takes me a second to recall the caramel chews.\
  \ I fish them out of my knapsack and hand two to the boy and his companion as an\
  \ expression of gratitude. It just so happens that the boy is accompanied by three\
  \ more friends. They eagerly chorus, \"Any left, Didi? Any at all please?\u201D\n\
  \nThanks to a slight change predicament, I most certainly do.\n\nLaughter bubbles\
  \ up from somewhere inside of me as I reflect on this charming sequence encompassing\
  \ every single thing I love about my motherland.\n\nIt's the simplicity of the lifestyle.\
  \ The way the tram costs five rupees, and a caramel chew\u2014just one. The supple\
  \ and imperfect order in which the laws may loosen and every so often that I might\
  \ offer, and accept, a caramel in place of paper money. The way a stranger is so\
  \ sincerely eager to lend a hand.\n\nIt's the way I can see, so clearly, that the\
  \ good hearts are great and many.\n\nI've experienced a million moments like this\
  \ one, the kinds that made the heart swell. Yet, when people ask why India means\
  \ so much to me or request recommendations, it's not as though I can say, \"Try\
  \ forgetting all your change one day and meet a shopkeeper with a fancy for caramel\
  \ chews...\"\n\nEven so, it is why, and they certainly ought to, because the warm,\
  \ fuzzy, little things are what make India so special. A fondness for any place\
  \ doesn't lie in a single metropolis or a particular incident.\n\nI suppose all\
  \ I\u2019m trying to say is that it isn't for the Great Taj that I'm in love with\
  \ India. And it isn't for the grand affairs that I'm in love with this life.\n\n\
  It's for the tiny happenings amid the major milestones; the slew of moments that\
  \ pile atop one other and fit together like Jenga blocks; the inbetween incidents\
  \ that won\u2019t befall any soul in any place in precisely the same way they fall\
  \ upon me."
