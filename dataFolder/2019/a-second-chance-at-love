Text: 'Losing a loved one is coming face-to-face with grief and uncertainty.  All
  kinds of questions come to mind each passing day, unsure of which path to tread
  or what next best thing to do.  Four years whizzed by without my knowing since this
  loss.  I lost grip of Time, seemingly lost interest in any thing I met each day.  Is
  this the end of my search for happiness?  What lies ahead?  Lest I lose my zest
  for Life, I have to do something.  That''s it !  Life has to move on for me!  Why
  dwell on the past?  Today may become the biggest leap I could ever take.  Why not?  As
  wise men say, Life holds many opportunities, so why not reach for your dreams? It
  sounds surreal, but who knows it will answer my quest if I don''t try.  It''s not
  too late, so I dared myself to be more adventuresome.

  Casting all doubts, anxieties, worries aside, I decided to discover for myself.
  To test the water.  To do the almost impossible dream. My travel to a place that
  had always been my childhood dream.  Will I realize this dream while here in the
  Philippines or somewhere else?  Oh well, I can dream, can''t I? To be able to reach
  this destination, I have to make decisions. What if this will not work for me?  What
  if I will meet more heartache and failures? I have to meet Fear in the face.  There
  must be a sign for me to push ahead with my dreams.  Is this place the realization
  of all my dreams? Mustering all the courage, I bravely take the first step. I HAVE
  TO DO THIS! I MUST!  Dear Lord, guide me in this journey in life. Help me focus
  on this trip and with Your blessing, I may achieve what I have been dreaming of.'
