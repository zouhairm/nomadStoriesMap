Text: It was last summers and the year was 2018. When my one friend ask to join him
  in a journey to Some mountains region in search of some herbs. I agreed to him and
  we are out on a journey to the Northern Areas of Pakistan. We made our 1st stay
  in Mansehra District. Our hosts were locals of that area mostly farmers to whome
  we meet to get herbs. The welcomed us with dry fruits and green tea. Thier tales
  of living in these remote areas are amazing and an advanture in itself. We remained
  there for 5-6 hours and than left for Naran Kaghan Valley. The  valley is sorrunded
  by lush green pine trees and the river Kunhar is traveling along with us all the
  way. The single road leeding us to the valley and melodies of our graduation time
  made this journey a very memorable. In our way we stop to try local dishes like
  chapli Kabab, pakoras trout fish. The food was delicious and mouth watering. On
  reaching the Naran valley we r welcomed by the cold breeze and mesmerizing views.
  We stayed the night in local hotel. The next day we planned to visit Lake Saif Ul
  malook. There is no road to the lake we travel by mou tain jeeps locally assembled
  by the village men's to earn their bread and butter. They take the tourists to this
  seneic lake.  We come back to our hotel that day and stayed two more nights in the
  valley. Really enjoyed the bonfire, local ripped fruits and dry fruits.,trout fish
  and other delicious food and beverages. It was a memorable trip with some beautiful
  and amazing friends. In future I want to go back to that area and explore it by
  tracking and hiking.
