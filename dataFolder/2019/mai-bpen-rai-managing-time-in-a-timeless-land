Text: "The Thai phrase \u201Cmai bpen rai\u201D (pronounced my pen rye) can be translated\
  \ as: \n\nThat\u2019s cool.\nDon\u2019t stress. \nNo problem.\nWell, that sucks,\
  \ but there\u2019s really nothing we can do.\n\nThis quirky concept can be endearing,\
  \ but when it comes to keeping schedules, it can be infuriating. Americans and time\
  \ have always had a rocky back and forth, one in which time clearly calls the shots.\
  \ Time to wake up, time for work, time to eat, Morris Day & The Time, etc. I was\
  \ now on \u201CThai time,\u201D and I learned more from this unique temporal perspective\
  \ than just how to relax and roll with it. \n\nI was in Krabi, on the shores of\
  \ the Andaman Sea. Krabi is known for its calm warm waters, majestic limestone cliffs\
  \ and the relaxed attitudes of its people. I was waiting for a bus to the airport\
  \ that was conveniently running on Thai time. Airlines stick to a schedule, and\
  \ if I didn\u2019t arrive at the airport at the designated time of my flight, I\
  \ would miss my flight and if I missed my flight, I would miss my next activity\
  \ that I had planned in advance in order to maximize my enjoyment of my activity\
  \ and my travel experience as a whole. It was time-sensitive, and no one understood\
  \ the enormity of my situation. \n\nI approached a tattooed gentleman who appeared\
  \ to be in charge of this operation and asked if the bus was actually on its way.\
  \ \u201CYes,\u201D he said. I was unsatisfied with this casual answer and waited\
  \ a few minutes before anxiously walking back to him and asking the same question\
  \ again, to which he cooly replied: \u201CMai bpen rai.\u201D I hastily put on my\
  \ backpack thinking that my situational readiness would hurry this along. Mai bpen\
  \ rai indeed; time was running out. \n\nTo comprehend the mindset of mai bpen rai,\
  \ you must understand the Thai\u2019s relationship with time itself. Where one might\
  \ define the American relationship with time as codependent, the Thai\u2019s could\
  \ be described simply as fluid.  \n\nTheir nebulous friendship with time stems from\
  \ the Buddhist practice of mindfulness. Thais, from a very young age, are taught\
  \ to be aware of their surroundings, to focus on existing in the present rather\
  \ than being fixated on what might happen later. By sitting still, noticing their\
  \ bodies and listening to their breath, Thais seem to settle themselves into a state\
  \ of calm that, with practice, allows them to realize that they exist within time,\
  \ not for time, even when facing the hellish prospect of missing a flight. \n\n\
  Mai bpen rai may seem nothing more than a casual phrase that would make an edgy\
  \ foot tattoo, but it goes much deeper. It speaks to Buddhism\u2019s teachings on\
  \ time and causality, impermanence and death, and accepting our place in the universe.\
  \ It reflects the ideas of how we can purge our lives of suffering through the cessation\
  \ of desire and become aware of how often time dictates our emotions. Buddha describes\
  \ emotions as a pack of dogs, all chained to one another. Those emotional dogs that\
  \ make up consciousness will pull at each other wildly, and the strongest of them\
  \ will be the one in control that day. Through mindfulness, one learns to tie all\
  \ of those dogs to a tree with deep roots, letting them wear themselves out until\
  \ they tire and can be mastered. It is through this patient discipline the Thais\
  \ acquired the tools to conquer emotion and master the art of true relaxation.\n\
  \nFinally, the bus arrived right on Thai time, and I felt relieved but embarrassed\
  \ for how wound up I was over nothing. Despite my agonizing, I made it to the airport\
  \ safely, and the world just kept on spinning. During my time in Thailand, I found\
  \ the biggest lessons were always learned in the most trivial of circumstances.\
  \ Whether it be waiting for a bus and having my notions of time shaken to their\
  \ core, or being handed a candle when I complained about the lights going out in\
  \ my hotel room, Thailand is just that kind of place. Mai bpen rai."
