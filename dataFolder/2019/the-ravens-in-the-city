Text: "Fascinated by the aspirations of people to to see the land of freedom, I too,\
  \ dreamed of spending meaningful time in the land of free. As  I volunteered in\
  \ a not for profit organization thinking of carrying a mission to help enlighten\
  \ my faith. I was assign in the City of Houston, Texas. It was around holiday season,\
  \ the wind and chills  and friendly greetings of people makes my time worthwhile.\
  \  The place is such a quite one, ordinary traffic in the rush hours, morning coffee\
  \ in side road of the homeless people, impatients driver, police patrol now and\
  \ then, such an ordinary time. \nEveryday of my walking time, I see these people,\
  \ police and homeless  became familiar to me, life is easy.\nEvery afternoon in\
  \ dusk time, I am amazed how the community of ravens decorated the City skyline.\
  \ They love to stay in the wires just above the traffic lights where the cars jammed\
  \ up. It is a view I don\u2019t wanna miss in going home every afternoon, they look\
  \ so serene. Hundreds of them finding their own spots in the long wires  patiently\
  \ waiting for the sun to rest. \nA group of homeless people are also used to see\
  \ the ravens, they are chatting in the corner and up above them are the listening\
  \ ravens. What a sight to see, different creatures of the same needs\u2014 a place\
  \ and a company. \nLife is indeed simple, it is not measured by thousand miles of\
  \ journey but rather of tranquility of one\u2019s heart. \nAs I continue my walking,\
  \  I passed a bridge down it is a small creek surrounded by commercial establishments,\
  \ cars are always noisy passing by. Yet down the creek are two white stork lazily\
  \ playing in the  water.  They are carefree from the honking cars and  pedestrians,\
  \ it gives me smile and sigh. \nWhat a wonderful life we have in our own cocoon\
  \ , the desires of the heart  can be search from within. I come this far to see\
  \ the simplicity of nature and life intertwined yet have its own directions. Though\
  \ being afar from familiar place gives time to see the essence of the journey, and\
  \ meeting the people of different culture makes me appreciate my own and be open\
  \ to the new one. \nThe City of good opportune  is s good experience for me to explore\
  \ my own soul and  travel the world in a happy perspective."
