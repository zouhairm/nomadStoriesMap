Text: "Less than twenty years ago, the skyline of Qatar was a completely monotonous\
  \ picture. Today, the natural reserves of oil and gas have allowed to build the\
  \ richest country on the lifeless land. Everything that was once sandy is now an\
  \ ever-growing tourist destination. \nModern Qatar is open not only for tourists,\
  \ but also for business.\nWhat can Qatar offer to foreign companies?\nFirstly, the\
  \ liberal system of internal taxation, secondly the 5% level of import duties, free\
  \ movement of capital, etc.\nVisa-free regime between Qatar and 80 countries of\
  \ the world, promotes personal meetings of partners, which stimulates further intensification\
  \ of cooperation.\nFor a more explicit explanation of the possibilities of cooperation,\
  \ let's describe Ukraine as an example. Regarding the priorities for the future,\
  \ the Qatari partners may be interested in the long-term lease of Ukrainian agricultural\
  \ land to grow their agricultural products, in direct purchases of grain in Ukraine,\
  \ especially barley, as well as in the participation of Ukrainian companies in the\
  \ construction of Qatar terminals for the storage and processing of grain products\
  \ and sunflower oil from Ukraine, followed by further exports to other countries\
  \ in the Persian Gulf and South Asia. \nAccording to the number of large-scale infrastructure\
  \ projects implemented by Qatar in the context of preparation for the FIFA World\
  \ Cup 2022, export of building materials and export of services, such as the execution\
  \ by Ukrainian companies works on the construction of roads, hotels, sports facilities\
  \ on the rights of subcontractors, as well as their equipment, remain promising\
  \ directions for expanding Ukrainian exports to Qatar.\nIn the near future, the\
  \ main trends in Ukraine's foreign trade with Qatar will remain unchanged, due to\
  \ the peculiarities of the local market situation, especially, the traditional demand\
  \ for Ukrainian metallurgical products, which has a high reputation of competitive\
  \ prices, as well as the positive reaction of the domestic market of Qatar to the\
  \ appearance of Ukrainian agrarian products. In addition, Ukraine's imports of petrochemical\
  \ products from Qatar (raw materials for the production of polymeric goods), which\
  \ are in demand of domestic producers, have good prospects.\nAt the same time, taking\
  \ into account the continuation of the trade and economic blockade of Qatar by Saudi\
  \ Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE after the breakdown of diplomatic relations\
  \ with these countries, vitally important issues for Qatar are food security and\
  \ timely implementation of infrastructure projects for the FIFA World Cup 2022,\
  \ which creates additional opportunities for expanding the export of Ukrainian agro-industrial,\
  \ metallurgical and machine-building sectors.\nQatar is the country that definitely\
  \ worth the attention of both tourists and entrepreneurs. And this is a great opportunity\
  \ to combine business with pleasure."
