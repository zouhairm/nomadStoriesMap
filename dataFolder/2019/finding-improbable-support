Text: "Finding improbable support \n\n \u201CWhat I was thinking?\u201D I told myself\
  \ while I was wandering around\u2026 My reflexion was followed by a vision that\
  \ definitely twisted my situation: I saw a woman putting on her sweater and coat,\
  \ so I thought: Yes! That\xB4s it!          \n\nNext, I reached the restrooms and\
  \ I started to take some clothes out of my suitcase to put them on. The valise\u2019\
  s heaviness felt pretty much the same, therefore I putted many more clothes on.\
  \ But it seemed not to work, and I was feeling on fire with all that garbing on.\
  \ I began to be entirely anxious about losing my flight, when I saw a garbage tin,\
  \ so I did something frantic: I threw some clothes away and continued putting some\
  \ more on. \nI started to cry without faith while I turned my steps towards the\
  \ counter clerk: I enquired for help about my extra weight-suitcase, I did not have\
  \ money to pay for it. But the worker told me she could not do anything. \n\nI felt\
  \ insignificant in the middle of that airport, thinking I did not have any money\
  \ to pay for anything: Any ticket, food, hotel nor train. I could not lose that\
  \ flight. Desperate, I went back to the tin and persisted leaving attires. At that\
  \ point I was crying to a great extent.\n\nIt was in Malpensa Airport, Italy. The\
  \ end of a weekend roundtrip for which I had already paid the ticket back to Rome.\
  \ I spent all my money experiencing a lovely shopper weekend in a city where, \u201C\
  out of the blue\u201D, they opened sales. Therefore, as a virtue\u2019s traveller-woman,\
  \ I took advantage and bought some clothes I swear I needed. Of course, taking some\
  \ debts I would have to pay for later. \n\nOn Monday, I fold every each piece of\
  \ clothing so they sized perfectly in my luggage. Impeccable packing! As if I had\
  \ not gotten anything extra. I arrived to the airport on time and did my check-in\
  \ but, when I put my bag on the trail: Cataclysm! Extra weight! I was supposed to\
  \ pay more money to carry my extras! Money that I did not have at all! Then I told\
  \ the clerk to wait for me and I started to ramble around, when I got the idea of\
  \ wearing almost all the content of my luggage...\n\nSuddenly, in the middle of\
  \ my desolation, the clerk approached and said: \u201CSomebody will help you, follow\
  \ me\u201D. I started to breathe again among all that outfit I had on me. I was\
  \ exhausted after lugging my bag here and there, leaving some pieces and seeing\
  \ the people witnessing one of my life\u2019s worst case scenarios. Once the clerk\
  \ told me so, it was like having the right to live again. I grabbed my case and\
  \ some clothes from the floor, next we get to her counter with my face on red and\
  \ big rounded eyes, like red Ping-Pong balls, for so much crying. \n\nAfterwards,\
  \ I saw him:  \"Wow, he is gorgeous!\u201D  It was my unique thought. -Even inside\
  \ misfortune, a woman is able to recognize a gorgeous man when she sets her eyes\
  \ on him.-\n\nFollowing, the last thing I expected: He talked to me! : \u201CI\u2019\
  m the captain and I want to tell you to not worry, I will transport your case as\
  \ if it was mine, just go on board\u201D.  It was breath-taking, I could not believe\
  \ it! Was I dreaming? No! It was for real, the captain in person, such a stunning\
  \ man had testified my bleakness and he took pity on me. I confess the pity is not\
  \ good, but in that instant I really believed in miracles: I found the most improbable\
  \ support in circumstances you would never think that is viable. Unreal, but thank\
  \ goodness it did happen to me! \n\nAnd that is how a virtue\u2019s traveller-woman\
  \ learns not to take advantage of every sale she finds on her trips."
