Text: "\u201CDue to a weather disturbance heading our way, we may have to postpone\
  \ the retreat.\u201D\u2014 read the email, four days before my Scuba Yoga retreat\
  \ in Grenada. At 28 years old, I had I planned this getaway as my final, boldest\
  \ effort to overcome my paralyzing fear of the ocean.\n\n62 percent. This is the\
  \ percentage of African Americans who have limited or no swimming ability. People\
  \ often joke that African Americans don\u2019t know how to swim, however, the reality\
  \ is swimming is rooted in a history of segregation and racism. A jarring history\
  \ where African Americans were prohibited from swimming in all white pools. Consequently,\
  \ swimming never became a major part of African American recreational culture. Swimming\
  \ was not a part of my upbringing. However, as I began to explore the world through\
  \ travel, I became tired of missing out on water-related experiences because of\
  \ my discomfort with swimming. Hence, I decided to take a revolutionary step: submerge\
  \ myself 30 feet below the ocean, the final step of this difficult relationship\
  \ I\u2019ve had with water.\n\nMy first step was to learn the basics of swimming\
  \ (again). I'd attempted this twice in the past; however, these attempts were unsuccessful\
  \ due to my perpetual fear of drowning which prevented any real progress. The third\
  \ time, with Grenada concretely in my line of sight, was different.  With a newfound\
  \ purpose, I went into my lessons visualizing myself swimming freely in the crystallized\
  \ blue waters of the Caribbean Sea. I had 8 sessions spread across 2 months to remove\
  \ my mental roadblocks through swimming. By the end of these sessions, not only\
  \ could I swim in the pool, I was as ready as I would ever be to push myself into\
  \ the ocean. Yet somehow this window of confidence felt temporary, and now, with\
  \ a storm on the horizon, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d get my chance. \n\nThe two\
  \ days following that email felt more like two years waiting for the status of the\
  \ retreat until the organizers confirmed it was still happening. When I arrived\
  \ in Grenada, I was welcomed by the sun and vibrant blue skies. But the day before\
  \ the retreat, the sky darkened, the clouds became ominous in the way they do only\
  \ during tropical storms, and the torrential downpour began. With panic, I checked\
  \ the weather forecast for the day of our scheduled dive and was relieved to see\
  \ only sunny skies predicted. \n\nWe began the day of the scuba dive with a gentle\
  \ flow yoga session in an open-air treetop studio. The stretching and breathing\
  \ helped to alleviate the nerves that were settling in as I started to process the\
  \ magnitude of the journey I was about to embark on. After yoga we learned that\
  \ despite the sun and cloudless skies, yesterday\u2019s storm could have made the\
  \ water murky. The captain was on his way to the diving area to see if the water\
  \ was clear enough for first-time divers. In spite of recurring uncertainty, the\
  \ other students and I prepared for the dive by practicing in the resort pool. I\
  \ eagerly zipped up my wet suit and put on my 50-pound tank before walking into\
  \ the pool to receive the lesson from the instructor. Being underwater was less\
  \ suffocating than I imagined it would be. While there, we communicated with hand\
  \ signals and perfected our breaths and leg kicks as we completed a couple of rounds\
  \ through the underwater obstacle course. It was then that we received the final\
  \ word: that the visibility in the water was not permissive for diving. \n\nThe\
  \ emotional tug of war was finally over. I pushed through my disappointment and\
  \ went to the beautiful Grand Anse beach with my friend. On the surface, the water\
  \ was calm and welcoming. I felt a sense of peace and contentment settle over me,\
  \ and my disappointment receded to the back of my mind. I walked further into the\
  \ Caribbean Sea with my mind clear and my body brushing against the gentle waves.\
  \ I was ready for this long overdue moment. I swam and floated with freedom in my\
  \ heart."
