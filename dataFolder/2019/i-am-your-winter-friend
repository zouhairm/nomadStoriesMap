Text: "The chilly cold December night had just dawned into a misty winter morning\
  \ when my train squalled into a small railway station in Madhya Pradesh, India.\
  \ I was going to Datia \u2013 I was going home \u2013 but unlike other times, I\
  \ wasn\u2019t happy. I was teaching a class of pre-medical students when the phone\
  \ rang. Amidst the screams and sobs of brother at the other end of the call, whatever\
  \ little I could make out shuddered me. The botany textbook lay open on the desk\
  \ as I rushed out of the classroom to the realization of the fact: PAPA was no more!\n\
  \nMy mind kept going back to the memories of last evening and anticipated a long\
  \ rueful course of future events that awaited me at home; I could see no respite\
  \ at hand. Among the hoarse voices of the vendors and tea-sellers that filled the\
  \ station, I heard a frail little voice begging for alms by the side of the glass\
  \ window pane of our third AC compartment. As we sat snug wearing our woolens and\
  \ socks, the figure of the man outside appeared cold, fragile. Who knew how he has\
  \ managed to survive the winter in that thin, torn rag of a T-shirt?\nSorrow has\
  \ its beauties; it makes you receptive to the pain of fellow sufferers. It removes\
  \ the concrete wall of discrimination called \u201Cclass\u201D that has kept the\
  \ \u201Chaves\u201D and \u201Chave nots\u201D separated from each other since eternity.\
  \ The next second I did something that only a person in that state of mind might\
  \ have dared to do. I gave away my Gucci sweatshirt!\n\nAs the train moved out of\
  \ the station, the silhouette of his face reflected many emotions all at once: surprise,\
  \ disbelief, panic, happiness, may be a touch of warmth. The emotions weren\u2019\
  t separate from one another; they all blended perfectly well \u2013 into the omnibus\
  \ of memories that is life.\n\nWhile travelling from my work place to my native\
  \ and back, I had nothing in my mind but PAPA and the people around suffering winters.\
  \ I know I cannot get my PAPA back but can definitely do something for the people\
  \ dying in winters.\n\nI am sure some of our winter clothes, shoes, socks, hankies,\
  \ etc. must have turned out to be short, discolored or simply lie unused in the\
  \ almirah wrapped in naphthalene balls. Why don\u2019t we approach the needy people\
  \ around and donate these things that are even presently \u201Cnecessary\u201D to\
  \ us?\n\nWhat all is needed to donate any such thing to the needy person is just\
  \ to click a pic along and post it in the social media pages quoting \u201CI am\
  \ your winter friend\u201D.\nTake it as an appeal, a request or whatever but doing\
  \ something at your end is way better than donating it to some third party, changing\
  \ your DPs with different countries\u2019 flagships, etc."
