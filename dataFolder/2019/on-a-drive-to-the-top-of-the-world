Text: "Of all of the miles to drive to the top of the world, the last fifteen are\
  \ the most challenging. It\u2019s July in Alaska and the sun hasn\u2019t set in\
  \ weeks. It simply hovers, eerily, and slowly slides across the horizon with just\
  \ enough effort to cast shadows but never sink below the sight of land.\n\nEven\
  \ at 3:47 am the town of Deadhorse is visible in the distance. We should only see\
  \ stars and the flickering lights of oil rigs. But a dreamlike twilight has encompassed\
  \ the landscape and left us entranced. We can see our mark as clear as the herd\
  \ of caribou feasting in the fields around us. \n\nIt\u2019s been nearly 400 miles\
  \ of rugged conditions along the Dalton Highway. With an unseasonable snowstorm\
  \ approaching, there was little time to stop. We\u2019re nearing fifteen hours of\
  \ driving, averaging just over 30 miles per hour. Aside from a 60-mile stretch of\
  \ recently paved surface, the highway has been a series of potholes, frost heaves\
  \ and packed dirt worn into washboards over time. \n\nRugged only begins to describe\
  \ the journey in these last dozen miles. It also describes our truck, the contents\
  \ of our camper and, at times, our spirits. We\u2019re all worn a bit from the road.\
  \ But the thought of arriving at the top of the world seems to lift the tread of\
  \ our tires above the raggedy gravel.\n\nAt this point we haven\u2019t slept since\
  \ the day before. We filled up on fuel and coffee several hours earlier and made\
  \ the decision to press on through the night. The window of opportunity was closing\
  \ with the storm encroaching on our dreams. \n\nWe had to go. The anticipation of\
  \ reaching Deadhorse kept us wide awake. Three years of dreaming and planning the\
  \ drive from Alaska to Argentina seem a distant memory. We\u2019re close to the\
  \ beginning now. \n\nLike many before us, we sold all we owned, cashed in our savings\
  \ and set out to drive the length of the Pan American Highway. However, unlike most\
  \ others, we\u2019re pretty sure we will not make it. There are too may things working\
  \ against us. \n\nBut we\u2019re not discouraged. It's the journey that we\u2019\
  re after. Already we can hardly recognize ourselves in the months and miles since\
  \ leaving Florida. Who we are if and when we arrive in Argentina is an afterthought\
  \ to who we are right now. \n\nWe are free, though bound by the same worries as\
  \ any other. Doubts set in intermittently. We are literally as far away on the continent\
  \ as we can be from anything familiar to us. A million things could go wrong. A\
  \ flat tire, blown engine or a Crohn\u2019s Disease flare up could bring us back\
  \ to reality. \nBut the reality is that we are close, so close, to letting our worries\
  \ give way to the embrace of an abundant life. \n\nWe are traveling toward a destination\
  \ only enough to orient ourselves. The Arctic Ocean is not the end for us. At that\
  \ point all the years of planning will be met with the silent understanding that\
  \ our journey has only just begun. The town of Ushuaia sits in near total darkness\
  \ at the bottom of the world approximately 13,000 miles as the crow flies.\n\nBut\
  \ we\u2019ll not drive as straight or as fast as the crow. We\u2019ll simply drive\
  \ and embrace the opportunity to try to do things we never thought possible. \n\
  At some point soon the road will end and we'll be staring out over the Arctic Ocean\
  \ toward a vast emptiness. From the profound inspiration of that emptiness we'll\
  \ turn south and drive on toward Argentina. \n\nThe unknown presents itself in our\
  \ imagination. We\u2019re pulled forward in a sense of wonder. Each mile takes us\
  \ one father than we\u2019ve ever gone before. Everything is new. Anything is possible.\
  \ \n\nIn Deadhorse heavy machinery, trucks and stacks of raw materials sit idle\
  \ in the dead of night. The town\u2019s only inhabitants seem split between a night\
  \ of rest and working in the oil field. \n\nWe\u2019re the only ones here awake.\n\
  \nTomorrow we\u2019ll step into the Arctic Ocean, splash the cold salty water on\
  \ our faces and judge whether we\u2019re awake, still dreaming."
