Text: "The summer of 2017 was one of profound new beginnings. I moved into my first\
  \ apartment, landed a corporate job, applied for a passport, and met my father for\
  \ the first time. My adult obligations seemed to be satisfied, but my inner child\
  \ was aching for adventure before I fully transitioned into the next phase of my\
  \ life. Luckily for my wanderlust, my father who lives in Chan Chemuyil, Mexico,\
  \ invited me to spend a few weeks with him so we could get to know each other better.\
  \ He offered to pay any necessary costs; the only condition was that I participate\
  \ in a Temazcal ceremony while there. Other than our initial meeting, our only engagement\
  \ had been through occasional messages on Facebook. Also, my ignorant understanding\
  \ as a sheltered American was that Mexico was unsafe, so I was hesitant to say the\
  \ least. Still, this wasn\u2019t enough to deter my curiosity, and two weeks later\
  \ I found myself stepping off a plane in Cancun.\n \nDuring dinner the first night,\
  \ my father cautiously asked if I had done any research about Temazcal. I admitted\
  \ that I had not, but he vaguely explained that it was a Mayan word for \u201Chouse\
  \ of heat\u201D and that I should drink plenty of water in the meantime, because\
  \ we would be participating the next day.\n \nThe following morning, we rode through\
  \ the backroads of Tulum into a discreet jungle area near the beach. A shaman greeted\
  \ us, bundles of herbs in hand. He expounded on the process and history of Temazcal,\
  \ but since my Spanish was infantile, my father had to translate every line to me.\n\
  \nTemazcal is an ancient spiritual ceremony that has been practiced by Mesoamericans\
  \ since the Mayans ruled. Participants sit inside a clay hut (the mother womb) while\
  \ pieces of volcanic rock (abuelitas) are burned in the center, ventilating through\
  \ a small hole at the top. Copal, herbs, and more abuelitas would be added to the\
  \ fire as we journeyed through four elements of the spirit (Earth, Air, Fire, and\
  \ Water). The task seemed simple: Stay in this pizza oven until the shaman said\
  \ we\u2019d had enough.\n \nWe crawled inside and sat in a circle. A firepit smoldered\
  \ in the center. Although it was dark, the entryway allowed me to see palm leaves\
  \ along the floor, and carefully arranged healing crystals around the fire. The\
  \ Shaman\u2019s assistant carried in the first volcanic rock on a long spatula-like\
  \ rod. Our Shaman then poured water over it so the Temazcal would fill with steam.\
  \ I thought to myself, \u201CThis isn\u2019t so bad, it\u2019s like being in a sauna\u201D\
  , but then the door closed.\nSuddenly it was pitch black, and I became fully aware\
  \ of just how hot it was. As the Shaman chanted, tossing herbs onto the fire, my\
  \ slight bout of anxiety turned into full-fledged panic. I wasn\u2019t sure what\
  \ frightened me more: the total darkness, the heat, or the dread that I couldn\u2019\
  t understand his mystic words.\nI eventually folded into a fetal position, hyperventilating.\
  \ Every few minutes another abuelita was added, my heart rate climbing with the\
  \ anticipation of each one. When the Shaman informed us that our second element\
  \ was opened, I begged him to let me leave Temazcal. He told me my journey wasn\u2019\
  t complete, that I needed to find a steady breath, and focus on my most intimate\
  \ fears. He said to use this time inside to reflect on why my father brought me\
  \ here. I counted the abuelitas, looking forward to those brief moments of the door\
  \ opening.\n\nAfter twelve abuelitas and two long hours, the ceremony was finally\
  \ complete. My father and I crawled out, both sobbing and pouring sweat. He embraced\
  \ me and through tears said, \u201CMy daughter, I love you. Thank you\u201D. The\
  \ emotion we exposed was overwhelming and surreal, but the clarity was certain.\
  \ My true fears were of release, receiving love, and lack of control. I was born\
  \ anew when I emerged from Temazcal\u2019s womb. The Mayans had blessed me and my\
  \ father\u2019s journey, and the Shaman was our guide."
