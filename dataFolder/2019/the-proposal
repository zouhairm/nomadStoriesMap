Text: "Ever since I met my wife, Abbey, a leap into the unknown is more of a life\
  \ motto than a single story theme. In our short time together, we have compiled\
  \ trips all throughout the U.S. as well as international destinations that include\
  \ the Riveria Maya, Hungry, Czech Republic, Austria and Spain, which is the setting\
  \ for this story. \n\nIt was fairly soon after I met Abbey that I knew she was just\
  \ different than anyone I had ever met. Call it fate, call it an accident, call\
  \ it Tinder, call it whatever the hell you want but our connection was undeniable.\
  \ Which was extremely tough for me and something I struggled with at first because\
  \ I never thought I was a person that was fit to get married. But as the days turned\
  \ into weeks turned into months, those feelings quickly faded and I decided that\
  \ the time was right for me to pop the question. \n\nNow, me being the great Leo\
  \ that I am, was not going to settle for one of these measly proposals. Marriage\
  \ is one of the most life changing events a person can experience so of course this\
  \ had to be EPIC! I had a few early misses on a few ideas but nothing was reaching\
  \ that stratosphere level until it came to me while I was watching the Bachelor\
  \ (I only watch it because Abbey and I make brackets, I promise). It was one of\
  \ the episodes where they travel to another country and because travel is such a\
  \ big part of Abbey's life (she's lived in Spain and the UAE as well) I knew that\
  \ had to be a large portion of what we would do. \n\nAs the planning continued,\
  \ I saw that I couldn't just have us go on a trip and I propose, it had to be an\
  \ event. I decided to make my own Bachelor episode, which I filmed with a friend\
  \ of me doing a few confessionals and those ridiculous B-roll shots they do. I also\
  \ decided that it would be more interesting if it was a chase across the world so\
  \ I booked my flight separate from hers. By the time she had seen the video I made\
  \ for her along with the plane and train tickets and Euros, I was already 30,000\
  \ feet up. \n\nI probably should have told you that before Spain, I was a virgin\
  \ international flyer whom didn't speak a lick of Spanish. Something that had escaped\
  \ my Leo mind in the planning stage so not only were my nerves high with a proposal\
  \ looming in the near future, at this time I was a huge nervous flyer so the Estrella's\
  \ were flowing all flight. But I eventually landed in Madrid, which gave me my first\
  \ new experience, the Taxi. As I noted previous, I didn't and still don't know any\
  \ Spanish so my American dumb ass got right into a Taxi with no way to communicate\
  \ with the driver. After 3 minutes and 21 seconds of going back and forth with the\
  \ driver (I wasn't saying the station name correctly), I finally started making\
  \ \"Chu Chu\" sounds and he chuckled and knew where to go. Lesson, learn the damn\
  \ language already. \n\nWhen we arrived to Atocha it was very overwhelming at first\
  \ with all the hustle and bustle but that quickly evaporated when I looked down\
  \ at my ticket with Barcelona as the destination. It was at this moment that I fell\
  \ in love with Travel. I had just flown across the world, to a country with no knowledge\
  \ of the language, where I communicated with a taxi driver by sound affect. And\
  \ now I was on my way to one of the most beautiful cities in the world by train\
  \ where I was able to really see the landscape of this country. It was this leap\
  \ of faith into the unknown that gave me a new sense of life and adventure. Oh and\
  \ the proposal was as EPIC as I wanted it to be. I will never ever forget my wife's\
  \ smile when she was walking up the street in front of the Sagrada Familia rolling\
  \ her massive suitcase behind her."
