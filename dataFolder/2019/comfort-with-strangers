Text: "I like airports. Am sure with this no one can guess where my story is headed.\
  \ It could be about travel, about architecture or just some random feelings. Airports\
  \ give me a feel of leaving and belonging at the same time. Nothing else does that.\
  \ And they give me time. If I am lucky there will be no connectivity on the phone\
  \ and paid wifi, a double whammy! An excuse to keep that life engulfing device out\
  \ of reach. This time I get to sit at airport book shops, read standing in queues,\
  \ observe the general social madness around me, visit a few curio shops, sip a coffee\
  \ and look at aircrafts landing and taking off. What\u2019s not to like, and you\
  \ wonder why people don\u2019t like airports. \nSo I am generally late and particularly\
  \ slow at these big institutions. And rushing like mad when the last call for the\
  \ flight to board is made. Always make it though, courtesy a small light fast moving\
  \ frame and a bit of luck thrown it. We were flying from George to Johannesburg\
  \ to catch an onward flight to Mumbai. Small aircraft, you had to walk to it. Twin\
  \ seats each side. My small group of 10 all from the travel fraternity had made\
  \ it in, seated and belted, engaged in the usual chatter of friends and business.\
  \ \nI rushed in last, took my seat. Had all strangers around me. Did the usual thing\
  \ of taking out the airline magazine and flipping the pages. Always a good read.\
  \ The flight took off and in a while across the aisle I noticed a senior couple.\
  \ As I looked, all out of no-where the lady started speaking to me. They were Europeans\
  \ from Netherlands who for many years had settled in Knysna in the outback, and\
  \ made a home for themselves. She asked me how I was getting along, the general\
  \ small talk, where all and with whom I had travelled the past few days , so on\
  \ so forth. In between was a short service for snacks and a drink. A pause.\nI asked\
  \ her where they were headed, back to our roots she said. And as the flight began\
  \ to land , she turned to me with water in her eyes and said perhaps they will never\
  \ come back to this city again. I waited. Her husband had been detected with cancer\
  \ and was an at advanced stage. No treatment was working and so they were going\
  \ back to try their luck in Netherlands. She had been to India and loved it for\
  \ its culture and its sense of belonging, for its people. I could only smile at\
  \ her and say, am sure God is with you and you will come back here again. And if\
  \ airports, and air crafts do their magic we will even meet again. \nIt\u2019s been\
  \ a year and a half since that happened, I don\u2019t know where they are. No names\
  \ were exchanged. Neither we they needed. But the thought lingers. Who out of the\
  \ blue on an aircraft, to a stranger tells something so personal? Travel does do\
  \ amazing things and leaves behind memories like a perfume. \n\nA true story. 22nd\
  \ sep \u2013 29th sep , 2016. South Africa trip."
