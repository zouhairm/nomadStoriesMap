Text: "The pinky finger of a landing strip into Costa Rica Tambour Airport juts out\
  \ into deep blue and milky-frothed ocean. My husband\u2019s body shakes next to\
  \ me, out of fear of flying. Out of not knowing what\u2019s to come.  He has never\
  \ been out of the United States, I remember what it feels like to be in a foreign\
  \ land where everything feels, well, foreign. \n\nThe plane lands amidst the bamboo\
  \ fields and reminds us that Tambour isn\u2019t really a traditional airport; it\u2019\
  s a hut in the middle of nowhere. There is no car rental office in sight. As we\
  \ walk off the jetway, a heavy fermented-fruit, earthy smell fills my breath and\
  \ the humid air coats my dry skin. The flight attendant tells us to walk down the\
  \ red dirt road about ten minutes and turn left at the palm tree with the blue ribbon\
  \ around it. \n\nAfter our mile-hike to the rental car place, I get out the paper\
  \ map I brought. As I navigate to the hotel, he complains about the potholes-to-another-world\
  \ in the road. \n\nNot yet in vacation mode, tension hangs heavy in the car. The\
  \ dense jungle has not lost its upper hand on the land. Iguanas and chickens dart\
  \ alongside the road. The absence of street signs contrasts our fast life at home\
  \ in California. I\u2019m waiting for the vacation magic to kick in.\n\nAfter about\
  \ two hours on skinny dirt roads, we get to our modest hotel. After dropping our\
  \ backpacks in the hotel room, we sit in the open-air, thatched-roof bar,  listening\
  \ to the sound of clay-colored robins as we sip Lava Flows.\n\nWe decide to go back\
  \ to the room to change for a swim. D. looks around and realizes his black backpack\
  \ is missing. We go back to the bar to tell the manager who then calls the police.\
  \ As we wait, we chat with the expat American bartender and find out that the average\
  \ wage of a teacher is $600 a month. Police make about $11,000 yearly. Tourists\
  \ are easy targets here in Costa Rica, she tells us. Don\u2019t count on getting\
  \ your stuff back.\n\nAfter filing a report, we decide to find another hotel. As\
  \ we check in, monkeys hang in the trees taunting us. I could watch them all day,\
  \ but D. wants to check out the surf.\n\nIt\u2019s a short walk down an overgrown\
  \ trail. On one side, the turquoise sea stretches flat and the thriving verdant\
  \ jungle stretches long and tall. Mango and banana trees line the edge of the shimmering\
  \ sand.  \n\nAs we walk,  a giant sea turtle emerges from the ocean, her wet flippers\
  \ covered in pebbled sand. Oblivious to our presence, she digs a hole thirty feet\
  \ from us and lays little white spots in the sand. When her duty is done, she covers\
  \ her precious deposits and lumbers back toward the sea.\n\nI am overcome by a desire\
  \ to follow her into the water. D. wants to walk a little more.\n\nAs I slip into\
  \ the sun-baked water, I feel light for the first time today. The salt water takes\
  \ my body and unclenches my muscles. As I float, my hair spreads out around my head.\
  \ I float face-down, eyes open and watch the momma turtle succumb to the tide pull.\
  \ I give in to the moment and count my blessings: A jobs. Indoor plumbing. And on\
  \ vacation, we get to see monkeys and wild birds. The momma turtle floats with the\
  \ current, giving in to the powers of the sea.\n\nAfter twenty minutes, I head back\
  \ up to the beach and look for my husband. Five hundred feet away, I think I see\
  \ him interacting with some large four-legged creature. \n\nA horse?\n\nI saunter\
  \ up, watching, hoping not to scare the beast. His arched neck, deep chest, well-muscled\
  \ back, and slightly rounded belly tell me he\u2019s healthy. His unkempt, gritty,\
  \ matted mane mark his wildness.  They are both standing under a mango tree, his\
  \ dark muzzle resting on D\u2019s hand as he shares the last of his mango. As the\
  \ horse finishes, he turns back toward the dense vegetation and disappears."
