Text: "The bridge appeared to be nothing particularly special. It was simply an unassuming\
  \ slab of concrete, bearing the weight of a dozen vehicles whizzing across its surface.\
  \ As we approached, I could see no grand pillars or arches but I knew in my gut\
  \ that this structure was built for a greater purpose than pure utility.  A brunette\
  \ backpacker from Bristol called from the rear of the coach that it looked like\
  \ just another highway. To me, it didn\u2019t matter. I was far less interested\
  \ in the lack of grandeur than in what was hidden underneath.\n\nThe Bloukrans Bridge\
  \ lay waiting near the eastern end of South Africa\u2019s famed Garden Route, straddling\
  \ the border of Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. It had once been the largest\
  \ concrete arch bridge in Africa but it was relatively easy to overlook when traveling\
  \ at more than 100 kilometers an hour, just another in a long series of bridges\
  \ along National Route 2. A glimpse under the surface, however, revealed over 20\
  \ cantilevers supporting the bridge\u2019s massive weight, as well as a long, narrow\
  \ metal walkway suspended just underneath the steady stream of speeding vehicles.\
  \ It was this walkway that called to me rather than any admiration for such an impressive\
  \ feat of civil engineering. It led to a small concrete platform nestled just underneath\
  \ the center of the bridge, where cliques of backpackers clustered together in nervous\
  \ anticipation, having made their pilgrimage to the world\u2019s highest commercial\
  \ bridge bungy.\n\nI knew I needed to be one of those pilgrims. This trip had been\
  \ meant to help me ease my anxious mind, to relieve me from the intensity of my\
  \ daily existence, and yet persistent tension between me and my traveling companions\
  \ had kept me trapped inside my own head. My mind was more fraught with doubts about\
  \ my life and future than before I\u2019d left Sydney. Even though I knew it was\
  \ irrational, I started to see the bridge and its extreme 216-meter jump as an opportunity\
  \ to shed all of the existential apprehension weighing me down. I was compelled:\
  \ to throw aside the fear and the worry and feel something.\n\nKnowing that my friends\
  \ would not share my craving for the flood of adrenaline, I quietly arranged to\
  \ join a crew of young travelers in the sleepy seaside town of Plettenberg Bay,\
  \ boarding an old coach on a damp, foggy morning, the air around us nearly pulsating\
  \ with expectation. The interior of the coach was abuzz with nervous chatter as\
  \ we started our sojourn toward the bridge, ready to join the ranks of so many adventurers\
  \ who had journeyed before us. The thick, gray fog gradually began to dissipate,\
  \ revealing a stunning panorama of green mountains, deep valleys, and winding rivers\
  \ flowing out into the Indian Ocean, appearing almost crystalline as the sun\u2019\
  s rays started to dance along its surface. Every minute we drew closer to the bridge\
  \ was another minute in which I spun mystical narratives in my head about fate and\
  \ destiny, when really I was trying to avoid the stark reality -- I was about to\
  \ entrust my life to a clump of elastic cords tied around my ankles.\n\nMy attention\
  \ snapped back into razor-sharp focus when I heard the brunette backpacker from\
  \ Bristol compare the bridge to another mundane highway, as I was certain she couldn\u2019\
  t be more wrong. This magical place could never be mundane. As the bungy crew tightened\
  \ our harnesses and led us down the walkway to our journey\u2019s end, the nervous\
  \ chatter quietened. I walked alone, apart from the rest, focused on nothing but\
  \ the chaos inside my mind until we reached the jump point. I stood there silently,\
  \ standing on a concrete platform under a busy highway, gazing out at the distant\
  \ horizon, listening to sounds of rushing traffic above and the screams of jumpers\
  \ below, convincing myself that this would be the moment I\u2019d traveled so far\
  \ to find, the moment when I could finally clear my mind and let go of all the uncertainty.\
  \ I inched myself forward to the edge of the platform, forcing my eyes straight\
  \ ahead, and I took a single, giant leap."
