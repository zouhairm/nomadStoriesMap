Text: "I can\u2019t lie.  I just can\u2019t.  I know that many people skirt the truth\
  \ when completing the Customs form but I know that if I lie, I will be caught.\n\
  \n\tSince I retired from teaching high school English, I have traveled extensively\
  \ (thanks retirement!) - to Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Spain, the Galapagos,\
  \ Machu Picchu.  My brush with the law came after a trip to Spain where I volunteered\
  \ for an immersion program of speaking English to Spanish business people who wanted\
  \ to learn more conversational English.\n\n\tI was housed in La Alberca, a National\
  \ Historic city about four hours west of Madrid, on the Silver Route of the Camino\
  \ de Santiago. The narrow stone roads and 14th century buildings circle the main\
  \ square, an area filled with historic tapas restaurants and bars.\n \n       As\
  \ in old times, a pig, aptly named El Marrano de San Anton (The Pig of Saint Anthony),\
  \ is blessed on July 13th each year and then let loose in the town to be fed by\
  \ citizens and tourists alike.  On January 17th of the following year, in honor\
  \ of the Feast Day of San Antonio, the porker is raffled off in the town square.\
  \ Those not able to see the animal in person can visit the stone statue of the pig\
  \ near the cathedral, off the Plaza Major.  Rumor has it that those couples wishing\
  \ to conceive touch the pig statue\u2019s privates.\n\n\tObviously, the all- important\
  \ Iberian ham is essential to the livelihood of La Alberca.  There are four stores\
  \ where one can purchase this delectable treat.  And, if you want the history of\
  \ the meat, you can visit the ham museum (!OH! Espacio del Jamon) where you are\
  \ instructed in the various levels of Iberian ham while sipping Spanish Roja. \n\
  \n\tOne rainy day, I ventured into the oldest ham shop in the city, a small establishment\
  \ with hams hanging from the ceiling and a variety of sealed packages ready to be\
  \ taken back to the US.  I was guaranteed that there would be no problem entering\
  \ the States with my ham.\n\n\tFast forward to my flight.  I completed the Customs\
  \ form, checking \u201Cyes\u201D to the question, \u201CAre you bringing in any\
  \ meat?\u201D  Remember that I can\u2019t lie.  I personally know people who have\
  \ \u201Csmuggled\u201D whole hams in their luggage, but that isn\u2019t me.\n\n\t\
  As I entered Customs in Logan Airport in Boston, I again completed the form, this\
  \ time via computer.  After an interminable wait, I stood in front of the Customs\
  \ officer.  Now I KNOW that he has seen my reply to the meat question, but he stoically\
  \ asks, \u201CWhat are you bringing into the US?\u201D  \n\n\t\u201CI have six small\
  \ canisters of La Alberca paprika and a sealed package of ham.\u201D\n\n\tDead silence.\
  \  His eyes bore into mine.\n\n\t\u201CGo stand by the red light.\u201D\n\n\tNo!\
  \  Not the red light!  I am a glaring felon according to the stares of the passing\
  \ tourists.\n\n\tOne half hour later, another CBP officer approaches and states,\
  \ \u201CFollow me.  We are going downstairs.\u201D  Downstairs?  The dungeon?  Am\
  \ I arrested?\n \n\tAfter securing my lone suitcase circling the conveyor belt,\
  \ I find that I am in the Agricultural Customs area.  I am told to stand in another\
  \ line within view of all sorts of bizarre items that have been confiscated from\
  \ travelers \u2013 blood-red fruits, florescent green vegetables, and odd orange\
  \ cone-shaped balls of some questionable nature.\n\n\tAn amiable Customs officer\
  \ questions me as to what I am bringing into the US.  \u201CA sealed package, only\
  \ six slices, of Iberian ham \u2013 not even the best Iberian ham!\u201D After my\
  \ suitcase is x-rayed I remove the meat. It is thrown into the \u201Cillegal item\u201D\
  \ pile.  Sensing my chagrin, the Customs officer tells me that regulations prohibit\
  \ bringing meat in from most areas of the world, although he admitted Australia\
  \ and Finland were legal.  Who knew?  \n\n       As Helen Keller once said, \u201C\
  Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.\u201D  Lesson learned."
