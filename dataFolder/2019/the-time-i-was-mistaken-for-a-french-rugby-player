Text: "Last January my family decided to embark on a trip to Southeast Asia. Upon\
  \ arriving in Singapore, a series of unpredictable events began to transpire. My\
  \ family and I had just left the Marina Bay light show and soon after grew hungry.\
  \ We began looking for restaurants near the financial district. Upon walking down\
  \ the street, I was swept up and hustled into a nearby restaurant by a group of\
  \ flamboyant, talkative and obviously wealthy Asian businessmen who were smoking\
  \ cigarettes on the street at the time. Suddenly, I found myself as one of them.\
  \ In this small restaurant, I sat observing the roundtable banter (of which I could\
  \ only slightly understand after completing my first Chinese course at Miami University)\
  \ though it was fairly obvious the conversation consisted of those poking fun at\
  \ one another. The liquor was flowing and at this point the men were more than obviously\
  \ intoxicated. Occasionally, the men on either side of me would say something to\
  \ another at the table and then look for my confirmation of which I would merely\
  \ give a slight nod and half smile which caused them to break into hysterical laughter\
  \ and pat my back or shoulder. The waitress came around to collect the used plateware\
  \ when suddenly the man next to me pulls her in close and whispers something into\
  \ her ear. Ten minutes later, she arrives with a bowl of what looked like whale\
  \ vomit. I was then notified that it was in fact shark fin soup\u2014a delicacy.\
  \ It was only after leaving the restaurant and seeing the menu posted outside that\
  \ I realized the man had purchased me a five hundred and fifty Sing dollar (slightly\
  \ over $400 USD) bowl of soup. When the check came, a quarrel ensued. The debate\
  \ was over who got to treat the group to the expensive meal. Finally, the same man\
  \ who had purchased the soup for me raised his hand making a point of his large,\
  \ gold and diamond watch and tossed down a wad of bills; it was the end of discussion.\
  \ At this point my family had long since retired to the hostel. It was nearly two\
  \ in the morning when the most English proficient member of the group asked if I\
  \ wanted to accompany the men on one of their yachts. Being an 18 year old whose\
  \ head is clearly screwed on wrong I decided to join them. When we got to the boat\
  \ we sat down at another roundtable and the man with the watch had one of his attendants\
  \ go to the cabin. She came back with a large wooden box, Gurkha cigars\u2014the\
  \ finest in the world. I am not a smoker but I had heard of these bad boys and just\
  \ had to partake. When I arrived back in Chicago I googled these cigars and it turns\
  \ out the cigar I had smoked was older than me. Towards the end of the night, one\
  \ of the men asked me what it was like to play rugby at the international level\
  \ and what it was like to travel and compete at the highest level across the world,\
  \ utterly confused, I looked down and remembered I had been wearing my Stade Francis\
  \ Pinks jersey, that along with my unconventional long hair (rugby culture) must\
  \ have given these men the impression that I was in fact a member of the Paris S.F.\
  \ Pinks. I can say with utmost certainty that the thirty five dollars I spent on\
  \ that jersey was the greatest thirty five dollars I have ever spent."
