Text: "Okay, you can take this post in continuation of my previous blog with respect\
  \ to my recent flight journey to Calcutta. And this piece is a bit hilarious one.\n\
  \nWe boarded the flight at around 5.45 in the evening from the rear gate since we\
  \ got our seats at the rear end of the aircraft. Apart from us, there were this\
  \ family of a husband, wife and around 3 years old child who was way too cranky.\
  \ The child was crying a lot and the mother was looking at me. So obviously I smiled\
  \ at her but never received one. Nevermind. Humans!\n\nThen there were these grandparents\
  \ who picked up a fight with one of the air hostesses because there wasn\u2019t\
  \ a single space for their bag to keep in the cabin luggage section. He was at its\
  \ peak of his voice when an air hostess requested to calm down and the luggage can\
  \ be kept under the seat but in vain. Amongst all of this, suddenly a lady who was\
  \ seated right in front of them said, \u2018Hi! Remember, we met at Sengupta Uncle\u2019\
  s place last October?\u2019\n\nOn recognizing her face, the grandparents started\
  \ smiling, laughing, and chit-chatting as if nothing really happened. Humans!\n\n\
  And then there was this father who was travelling with his two teenage daughters.\
  \ He was somewhere middle aged and was in a pink shirt and faded jeans when he boarded\
  \ the flight and while the flight landed in Calcutta, I saw him looking like one\
  \ of the men from igloo where he had covered himself with this light blue coloured\
  \ hoody jacket. Now you might wonder how do I remember so much about this particular\
  \ man. Well that\u2019s because he was way too restless; and the fact that he was\
  \ sitting beside my brother who wasn\u2019t feeling well.\n\nThis man was really\
  \ something. As soon as the flight landed, he at once raised from his seat, opened\
  \ the cabin luggage section to fetch his bag. Trust me, the aircraft had just landed\
  \ and was still on the move on the runway and didn\u2019t even reach the airport\
  \ to halt. He was immediately asked to be seated by the air hostesses and other\
  \ passengers; and not just once, he was asked more than thrice to do so.\n\nOnly\
  \ when one of his daughters asked him to sit, he did with a pissed off face murmuring,\
  \ \u201CEi meyetir jonno amra train ta miss korbo. Aapnara ki daayi hoben amar train\
  \ ta miss hole?\u201D meaning \u201CWe are going to miss our train only because\
  \ of this girl (air hostess). Will you people be responsible if we miss our train?\u201D\
  \n\nTo this, my mum, being that silent swag woman said, \u201CIf the pilot would\
  \ have stopped the aircraft right over here, would he be able to run all the way\
  \ to the airport and get his train?\u201D. My dad giggled and asked mum to stop.\n\
  \nHowever, when the aircraft reached the airport after around 15 minutes, we all\
  \ stood up to fetch our bags and that\u2019s when the restless father called one\
  \ of his daughters to join him fast before they miss their train. My mum was shocked\
  \ when she realized that daughter was sitting right beside her and since we were\
  \ all bengalis, she did obviously overhear what mum said. So embarrassing.\n\nHaahaahaa!\
  \ Humans!"
