Text: "\"I am glad I decided to travel\",was the first of thoughts that crossed my\
  \ mind when I first set foot in the Island of Langkawi.Amidst all instincts to save\
  \ up on the income from the initial few working months,I had finally decided to\
  \ join my girls on a trip to this island which offered breathtaking adventurous\
  \ sports and equally appealing offerings from the nature.\n\nArriving at night,after\
  \ having boarded a flight from India via the capital city of Kuala Lumpur,we made\
  \ it to our destination by night, just on time to hit the sack.\n\nWaking up to\
  \ smell the salty sea and embracing the holiday mood,we figured out that we had\
  \ to rush to report at the starting point for our day's adventure booking.As we\
  \ headed out to the coast,we observed the local life by the sea and noticed how\
  \ relaxed they were about their lives.One could always wish for a life like that.There\
  \ were many immigrants in the area as well,who had set up their living based on\
  \ what Langkawi had to offer.\n\nWe grabbed our breakfast from a local store along\
  \ with some sun protection as we were expected to be out in the sea until late evening.As\
  \ we reached the starting point,our bikes were ready and waiting.Oh, now you can\
  \ imagine what we were all excited about.\n\nWe were briefed,few operating instructions\
  \ for about 5 mins and then we were to take off on our own which was hard to make\
  \ out from their nearly ineffective communication.We got hardly any clue that we\
  \ were about to drive along the waves on our own, until one of the guides started\
  \ his ski and gestured at us to follow.\n\nEschewing all the fear calls from within,with\
  \ certain amount of technical struggle we ignited the bike and accelerated.With\
  \ a puff of water behind, the ski plummeted forward, lodging a fireball inside.The\
  \ same continued for another 5mins until I gained some control over the jet's power\
  \ and learned to manage the cat in the sea.\n\nAnother 5mins of balancing and we\
  \ saw the guide speeding in full throttle and waving at us to follow his lead.Rolling\
  \ the handle to its top mark, we felt all the sea wind trying to talk to us for\
  \ the first time which felt like she was out there waiting, to whistle in our ears\
  \ and  to hold our hands  and pull us along with her, waiting for company.We were\
  \ ecstatic in the company and shouting back at her with smiling faces in response.\n\
  \n15 mins into the sea and we found us at an eagle feeding spot in the middle of\
  \ the sea.Magestic wings circling around, waiting for little fins and some offerings\
  \ from fellow visitors.The next stop was an echo point were two hills met and according\
  \ to the guide resembled a pregnant lady.We were shouting rubbish,waiting for our\
  \ sounds to ring back,which it did,giggling at our cacophonies.\n\nOne of the favourite\
  \ spots within the trip was a point where the guide asked us to take off our life\
  \ jackets and jump into the high density water, to float.The cowards we were, we\
  \ jumped only with the jackets on.But still enjoyed the perpendicular hills,lying\
  \ down on the waters.\n\nThis was the last spot with guidance after which they left\
  \ us to speed and explore on our own.This is where we enjoyed the wilderness of\
  \ the sea when everybody got out off sight,the slight dismay added to the working\
  \ adrenaline gave the peak of satisfaction.\n \nThe five hour trip didn't feel like\
  \ it lasted enough.After each stop we kept expecting more.But it had in it ,all\
  \ and it did leave our limbs and muscles tired which ushered us to the next spot\
  \ in Langkawi, something the place is renowned for,yes the Spas! We chose one of\
  \ the best places to help us rejuvenate,The Alun Alun.It was such a rewinder.One\
  \ of us did even get a hair do for free from one of the masseur.\n\nWhat I didn't\
  \ include here are the food options.Langkawi has ample to offer given the mixed\
  \ culture and core traditional background.It is an escape to your own self to retrospect\
  \ your guts.Never miss a chance!"
