Text: "\"Vrangggg--\" A metal case fell out from his old camera bag, I picked up and\
  \ gave it back to him. \"Ah! Silly Me! My 'Bon Bon' ! Do you want some?\" He scratched\
  \ his head and gave me a big wide smile. Apparently I just realized all the sweet\
  \ confections are called as 'bonbon' in french. Such a cute name! It reminds me\
  \ the powdery candy encased in a rusty metal box from the famous French movie Amelie.\n\
  \nPierre is a cheerful and lovely old man. It was on the evening I went to Trocadero\
  \ platform alone to catch a glimpse of my dear Eiffel tower before sunset. I quickly\
  \ put on some lipstick and prepare to selfie with Eiffel, and caught this old man\
  \ in his 70s with a camera smiled at me. \"Seeing the Eiffel is like meeting a lover,\
  \ I need to put on some make up-\" He then approached me, used some basic English\
  \ to tell me that although he couldn't speak English well but he could help me to\
  \ take pictures. I was so glad about this! He then took his camera out, and showed\
  \ me some hand drawn postcards by him.\n\nThe postcards are done by digital painting,\
  \ he was so proud to tell me that it was his first car and he put it in his doodles.\
  \ I am extremely impressed by Pierre, a 74 yrs old man who knows E-mail, and even\
  \ Photoshop! Suddenly he discovered that he hasn't brought his memory card along\
  \ and asked me to wait for him to get one in the metro station, I was flattered\
  \ and touched, and said that I will walk him to the station. It might be seen as\
  \ a dangerous action for a female backpacker to follow a stranger's way, but my\
  \ intuition told me that this is a magical experience that granted for me, in this\
  \ lovely city! En route we talked about music and movies, and he hummed the \"Hey\
  \ Ho\" theme from Snow White. God, can't this be more fairy-tale like? \n\nWe strolled\
  \ around Eiffel to take photos, in the garden, under the tower, by the Merry-go-round.\
  \ I felt bad for making Pierre run ups and downs, other than \"Merci, Merci Beaucoup\"\
  , I can't think of a better way to express my gratefulness. However he is always\
  \ smiling, pointed at my face and said that he likes my smile, therefore don't worry!\
  \ I was thinking, an old man at this age should be dining happily with his family,\
  \ why would him strolling here alone? So I decided to treat him for dinner. Looking\
  \ at the optimistic old man, reminds me of Pinnochio's father, he must have felt\
  \ lonely sometimes.\n\n\u4ED6\u753B\u4E86\u4ED6\u81EA\u5DF1\uFF0C\u8BF4\u4ED6\u4E03\

  \u5E95\u3002\n\nWhile waiting for dinner, due to language barriers we couldn't talk\
  \ a lot, so I suggested us to communicate by pictograph. He drew the Eiffel, and\
  \ an arrow pointing towards Barcelona (where I live), and tried to make brief sentences:\"\
  \ Me,happy today, but sad, because...\" He then curled his finger to mimic the walking\
  \ action. Alas, it must be a long time that he hadn't eat with a company. Therefore\
  \ I tried to ask about his family situation. He paused awhile and started drawing\
  \ his family trees, he used to have a happy family but they had divorced and all\
  \ his kids and wife had moved away, leaving him alone in Paris. He pointed at my\
  \ face, and doodled a bit, according to him it was his wife. \"You have a pair of\
  \ bright eyes, my wife has a pair of bright eyes too, and same smiley face, with\
  \ a pair of apple cheeks like you...He gave a quick wry smile and bowed his head,\
  \ and I can see tears in his eyes.\n\nOh dear! Such a heart wrenching story, I guessed\
  \ he missed her a lot. At this magical moment, I believed it was fate that allowed\
  \ me to be a messenger that accept all these unsaid feelings, and listened to the\
  \ sentiments and emotions that had been hid for years. I gave him a hug and promised\
  \ that I can be his friend, and so I still receiving letters from him today! Oh\
  \ Paris, such a wonderful encounter!"
