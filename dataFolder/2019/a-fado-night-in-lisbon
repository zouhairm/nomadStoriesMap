Text: "If someone asked me what to do in Lisbon, I would say: \"get a taxi\". It is\
  \ a great opportunity to get in touch with the Portuguese culture and to talk to\
  \ the locals. At least that's what happened to me. I was traveling with my mother\
  \ and we were going to spend two days in Lisbon. Some people advised us: \"So you\
  \ need to hear fado. Go to 'A Severa' then. It is a old and traditional fado house\"\
  . So we did. At the reception of the hotel we found another Brazilian mother and\
  \ daughter. We encouraged then to go with us. The taxi had arrived. The taxi driver\
  \ was a tall and robust man with thick gray mustaches. \"Let's go to Severa, then\"\
  , he said. Our adventure toward Bairro Alto had begun. \"Do you like fado? Have\
  \ you ever been to Severa?\", we asked, hoping that the indication of the hotel\
  \ would be good. \"I like to leave clients in the fado houses. I already went there\
  \ to leave some\". I noticed his light and honest humor. At the moment, I was a\
  \ little tense about returning to the hotel. At the end of the show it was going\
  \ to be very late. No one had a phone with signal and we did not know if there was\
  \ a taxi stand near the fado house. So I took the opportunity to ask: \"How do we\
  \ get a taxi in Lisbon\"? I thought he was going to answer: \"There's a point near\
  \ Severa,\" or \"dial the number\" or \"call my number\". But in his response once\
  \ again I noticed the authentic Portuguese humor: \"Ora, pois! Just open the door\
  \ of the cab and come in\". The taxi driver continued to speak in a high, humorous\
  \ tone: \"I like Brazil. I have seen many Brazilian telenovelas: Tieta, Escrava\
  \ Isaura, Dona Flor and e seus dois maridos\". He also commented on the great community\
  \ of Brazilians living in Lisbon and asked about the new president of the country.\
  \ Everyone is curious about this subject. \"His first name is Messias. And the Messias,\
  \ when he came into the world, did not please everyone either\", he took the opportunity\
  \ to give his opinion. We changed the subject, to avoid tensions and my mother asked\
  \ about Cristiano Ronaldo. \"Oh, do you like Cristiano Ronaldo, then\"? He gave\
  \ a long, loud laugh. \"Or do you like Cristiano Ronaldo's dollars\"? The other\
  \ mother in the car, sitting on the driver's side bench, continued the conversation:\
  \ \"And what about you, what's your name, senhor\"? He also responded with religious\
  \ references, showing a little of his faith and beliefs: \"My name, my name is the\
  \ name of the father of Jesus\". The woman who asked the question answered: \"Ant\xF4\
  nio\"? The driver stopped the car abruptly and raised both hands, surprised and\
  \ amused: \"But, do you not know the name of Jesus' father\"? I said softly from\
  \ the back of the cab: \"It's Jos\xE9\". The taxi driver laughed: \"See, she knows\
  \ the name of Jesus' father\". The woman continued: \"It's just that Ant\xF4nio\
  \ is a name fairly used here, isn\u2019t it\"? Jos\xE9 was excited to talk about\
  \ the traditional Portuguese names. He was driving with one hand and gesturing with\
  \ the other: \"Ant\xF4nio, Fortunato, Jo\xE3o, Tiago, Martim, Miguel, Francisco.\
  \ They are all my brothers\". At that moment, we were already arriving in the narrow\
  \ streets of Bairro Alto. My mother was a little afraid that we would not get there,\
  \ with him talking nonstop, gesturing, stopping the cab abruptly. She thought he\
  \ could hit the car. So she said: \"Is it close? If yes, we can get down here now\"\
  . Jos\xE9 replied outraged, but also laughing: \"But how? Do you want to get off\
  \ before you get there? Take it easy, we're arriving\". A few minutes later, we\
  \ were in front of 'A Severa'. \"We're here, ladies. Have a good night of fado.\
  \ It was a pleasure to meet you all\", said Jos\xE9. He left and I got the feeling\
  \ that some of the authentic Portugal went along with him."
