Text: "I've always wanted to witness sunset meeting the horizon of an ocean, \n\n\
  It was February 2018 one week before college started me and my two other friends\
  \ decided to go visit gawadar , a small peninsula sharing shores with indian Indian\
  \ Ocean, Gawadar is well known for its golden beaches and deep harbor, we planned\
  \ to see every beach in gawadar but only could see two. There were so many places\
  \ to go but not enough time.\nBooking our tickets to Gawadar we waved our hometown\
  \ goodbye and got on the bus. Each of us started sharing our humorous travel experiences\
  \ and sharing buckets full of laughs, every next story told was funnier than the\
  \ former or may be we were excited enough to find everything joyous. On way to Turbat\
  \ which was the first stop towards our destination clouds were getting darker and\
  \ thicker, ready to drizzle. It was just a matter of time when it started raining\
  \ and our journey got even more pleasant, the raindrops on the windshield and sound\
  \ of the wipers was something that time, i could do nothing but to stare at the\
  \ raindrops getting wiped out and listen to the wipers going back and forth, it\
  \ was one of my favorite moments of that journey.\n\nAfter a 4 four journey and\
  \ reaching at our destination we rested a while and decided to go see the sunset\
  \ before we'd miss it, i have never expected to find it so beautifully relaxing\
  \ and peaceful at the shore of a calm ocean, we were only the three and no one else\
  \ at the beach it was a life time experience,i could literally think of nothing\
  \ and my mind drowned in the depths of an unexplored peace and i was only gazing\
  \ at the sun setting, hiding behind the vast ocean , the place where i was coming\
  \ from, there's not any beach except dry and never ending barren fields, it was\
  \ my first time witnessing a sunset from a beach and i never expected to find it\
  \ so beautiful, calm and peaceful."
