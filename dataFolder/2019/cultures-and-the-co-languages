Text: 'As Languages and Civilization lover, the most common thing we can touch in
  so many Cultures is the co language, Because i am pursuing a new Program in Indonesia
  this year about Tourism and Indonesian  Culture  thus i have explored so many common
  words in different Language, for example: although  Indonesia and the Arab countries
  are very far from each other but the Indonesian  Language and Arabic have so many
  common Vocabulary.  another Example, the English and French Language have more than
  30% of common Vocabulary, and in some cases we can add German to inter corporate
  in this Fact. So i see that  so many Cultures in the World are so related to each
  other, some historically, some other sociologically or with Culture, that is why
  while i am studying this Major i discovered so many synonyms we can use in more
  than 3 Language, that means  we can relate these Cultures with some historical Facts,
  which really gave the impact to this Co language. When you want to study Tourism,
  you have to learn the Language, and when you learn the Language you will study about
  the History of this Language and Society, thus you will discover so many common
  historical Fact between so many Civilizations and Countries.'
