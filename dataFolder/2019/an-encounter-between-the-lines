Text: "It was meant to be an easy saunter. Map a couple of backroads of the UN Green\
  \ Line that separates the Republic of Cyprus and the northern Republic of Northern\
  \ Cyprus, look for anything interesting and head for a grilled bream lunch at the\
  \ seaside port of Gemikona\u011Fi (Karavostasi). As with all things in Cypriot politics,\
  \ Turkey and the UN, nothing was going to be easy.\n\nThe Green Line had cut a relatively\
  \ peaceful swathe through Cyprus since 1974 keeping the two communities apart \u2013\
  \ Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. The Line was a bit like the line between\
  \ the Koreas except that it was haphazardly armed and had lots of holes in it. I\
  \ was driving in between holes from the northern side looking for a shortcut from\
  \ the village of Lefke to my seaside date with a grilled fish.\n\nAs I approached\
  \ a curve in the road running parallel to the Green Line\u2019s overlap with the\
  \ south I headed in the direction I wanted to go, back to the sea. I was well equipped\
  \ in my French-registered blue Peugeot 307, notebooks, maps, two cameras and a clutter\
  \ of lenses, but I was the only car travelling these parts. How I got behind the\
  \ Green line was a bit of mystery, but behind it I most certainly was.\n\nI rounded\
  \ a hillock upon the summit of which stood what looked like two shepherds. Bucolic\
  \ I thought to myself. I then veered upwards over the flank of the hillock until\
  \ it was almost imperceptibly blocked by a red-painted iron gate topped with barbed\
  \ wire and emblazoned with a yellow skull and crossbones and an image of soldier\
  \ pointing his rifle at some hapless intruder. Oops! My day was about to turn awkward.\n\
  \nI had entered a cul-de-sac and found a Turkish military camp just inside Turkish-held\
  \ Cyprus. Executing a smooth three-point turn I hastily pointed myself back whence\
  \ I came. The two shepherds were now advancing down the hill their \u2018staves\u2019\
  \ now looking more like rifles and their rustic peasant clothing now quite obviously\
  \ well-worn military fatigues. They were not smiling.\n\nThe two rough cut Turkish\
  \ military men intercepted my escape road before I got to it and motioned me to\
  \ stop. This was going to be challenging. I lowered the driver\u2019s window and\
  \ expected trouble.\n\n\u201CBurada ne halt ediyorsun, bu askeri bir kurulum mu?\u201D\
  \ said soldier number one, or at least I assumed he did as I do speak Greek, but\
  \ not Turkish and he was bound to be asking \u201Cwhat the hell I am doing here\
  \ near a military installation\u2026.\u201D.\n\nSummoning the best of Bertie Wooster\u2019\
  s clipped, colonial English I countered: \u201CLooking for a short cut, actually\
  \ chaps, trying to find a way through from Lefke to Gemikona\u011Fi. Any ideas as\
  \ I think I am frightfully lost?\u201D As preposterous as it now seems in retrospect,\
  \ talking like a toff with a daft grin on my countenance seemed at the time the\
  \ only way to profess my silly carelessness.\n\nIt didn\u2019t cut the mustard.\
  \ The faces of the soldiers remained cast in inscrutable stone. Guns pointing skywards\
  \ they walked round the car, looked in the car, looked long into my silly grinning\
  \ face and muttered untranslatables. Midnight Express had just stopped on a backroad\
  \ in Northern Cyprus and I had a one-way ticket to a dank cell in a dungeon.\n\n\
  \u201CHi\xE7 sigara var m\u0131?\u201D said soldier number two. I would have been\
  \ totally mystified as to what he said had he not gestured with two fingers pointing\
  \ to his lips. He wanted a cigarette.\n\n\u201CSorry, old boy,\u201D said I summing\
  \ yet another frantic string of Woosterisms, \u201Ccan\u2019t oblige. Gave them\
  \ up when I finally turned sensible. Can\u2019t imagine why you would want them.\
  \ Bad for your health, chaps. You should stick to tea \u2026\u201D.\n\nWhen delivered\
  \ with a smile and a tonality that bordered on quite flustered, even the most incomprehensible\
  \ English can work its charm even on Turkish soldiers. I shrugged my shoulders and\
  \ optimistically pointed back to Lefke.\n\n\u201CHay\u0131rl\u0131 yolculuklar!\u201D\
  \ was the last thing I heard as they parted and allowed me unencumbered passage\
  \ back to Lefke. That was one express train I was not taking."
