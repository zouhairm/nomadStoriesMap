Text: "It was a bleak and dreary day for me. I'm fed up of my work as a psychotherapist\
  \ for five years. I'm drained, I feel depressed, and I need to breathe. Then suddenly\
  \ out of nowhere I tapped on a ticketing website of an airline company. I randomly\
  \ type down Thailand for the destination. Then the next Wednesday I find myself\
  \ in an airplane bound for Phuket, Thailand. \n\nAs I step out of the airport I\
  \ feel the sense of nostalgia. Realization hit me; I am now in a different country,\
  \ with a different culture and different language. Without itinerary on hand I grab\
  \ my bag and with much confidence ask for a taxi going to town for my hostel. It\u2019\
  s past four in the afternoon and I feel the dread of travelling alone at night.\
  \ Admittedly I am a person without sense of direction. \n\nAs I\u2019m having the\
  \ ride the driver kept on talking to me he is mumbling the best English words he\
  \ can muster but everything was so vague to me. My mind was lost my eyes were fixed\
  \ on the window watching some scenery grasping some kind of familiarity. This is\
  \ not the first time that I was out of my country but this time I feel so lost,\
  \ I don\u2019t know why. I was awakened in my reverie by the persistent questions\
  \ of the driver. \u201CWhere to Ma\u2019am?\u201D and I just keep on saying \u201C\
  near Central near Makro\u201D because all I know is that my hostel is near that\
  \ area. With much turns and looking we have reached our destination. I hurriedly\
  \ paid my taxi and entered the hostel checked in and went to my room. I feel the\
  \ great sense of relief. \n\nOn the next day I woke as early as I can I will face\
  \ everything now. I\u2019ve asked directions from the hostel staff and decided to\
  \ do my exploration. I went out for my first Phuket, Thailand adventure I took my\
  \ first \u201Csongtaew\u201D (bus) ride going to Patong. It\u2019s a beach area,\
  \ a beautiful one with lots of water activities to try to. So I did. I\u2019ve had\
  \ my jets ski, banana boat and parasailing ride. All of them are first in my life.\
  \ I have meet friends locals and foreigner alike. At the end of my first day I feel\
  \ the great sense of enjoyment. \n\nMy days go on as that more beach activities,\
  \ exploration and food tasting. I had my fill of Thai best street food,  \u201C\
  pad thai\u201D and  \u201Csomtang\u201D that taste so good. The best teas too. \
  \ I have even tried the exotic food. I have my Thalat adventure that is satisfying\
  \ both to the eyes and stomach.\n\nA week had passed and I am still at the island\
  \ enjoying the new sense of freedom. The freedom I felt away from the stressful\
  \ environment that had engulfed me for years and the negativity of it all. I find\
  \ peace deep within. I feel comfort living here and I have decided that I should\
  \ stay here. I look for a job that suits me then a friend told me that I can be\
  \ a Foreign English Teacher if I want to. So I\u2019ve looked for vacancies and\
  \ luckily I was hired. I was so ecstatic about it.\n\nNow it had been eight months\
  \ that I am here. I am glad I\u2019ve stayed. I am relaxed now more at ease and\
  \ more at peace as a person. What made me stay are the great people, great food\
  \ and a beautiful place. Thai people are respectful and honest. The foods are known\
  \ as one of the best cuisine in the world with their herbs and spices. The place\
  \ is relaxing they have nice beaches, islands and party places if you need to.\n\
  \nThis adventure started bleary but it ended best for me. Taking the chance to leap\
  \ into unknown makes whole again. It quenches the thirst I felt within. It satisfied\
  \ the craving not just of my body but my soul too. The question that lingers to\
  \ me now is: \u201CWhat if I have not taken that chance?\u201D"
