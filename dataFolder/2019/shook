  \ Doh\n\nListening: Fresh eyes \u2013 Andy Grammer\n\nMood: Excited and restless\n\
  \nFate had it that Europe 3.0 was meant to happen. Early this year I decided not\
  \ to have a European summer (it\u2019s true). I decided I wanted to spend this year\
  \ focusing on myself (just trying to get ahead of the quarter life crisis, you know\
  \  ). Amongst that there were other factors: fluttering around the idea of London\
  \ and wanting to travel with my parents \u2013 ultimately it just didn\u2019t feel\
  \ \u201Cright\u201D.\n\nHowever things started to move from winter to summer\u2026\
  \ and i decided it was time. IT WAS TIME FOR YOUR GURL TO HAVE A EUROPEAN SUMMER.\
  \ *cue basic girl quote ahead* We travel not to escape life, but for life not to\
  \ escape us XD. \u2026 After scoring a new role at a new company (my biggest goal\
  \ for the year), i decided to take the leap and travel solo around South Europe.\
  \ And then I planned this whole itinerary within a week HAHA.\n\nI feel like somehow\u2026\
  . SOMEHOW at the end of this season of my life, I ended up with the best outcome\
  \ possible \u2013 beyond what i wanted and needed. And I\u2019m just really happy\
  \ and content with everything that I have and am blessed with the fabbiest friends\
  \ and fam :\u2019).\n\n \nExcited to have my slice of European summer and then to\
  \ come back and get stuff done.\n\nSide note: My decision to make this spontaneous\
  \ trip was influenced by the book \u201CWander Love\u201D (I really recommend \u2013\
  \ she\u2019s such an inspiration :\u2019)). Every time I read it, it just makes\
  \ me so damn excited, curious and inspired to explore things out of the norm (read\
  \ exotic).\n\nSide side note: I stumbled across my horoscope for this year and it\
  \ said that I would experience big change in my life from May \u2013 June. If this\
  \ isn\u2019t proof that horoscopes are real\u2026 I don\u2019t know what is HAHA.\n\
