Text: "Saturday June 10\n2017\nAlgarve, Portugal\n\nI stood still as the men at the\
  \ bar moved around me. Their white t-shirts illuminated under the blue and green\
  \ lights that cut across the crowd like lasers. The music thumped under the bottom\
  \ of my feet and vibrated through my clothes. I was clear-headed and sober, surrounded\
  \ by clusters of men dancing. \n\nThrough the smoke and the floor filled with men\
  \ I saw someone. A guy who was short, wore oversized glasses and his dark hair flopped\
  \ above his eyes. For a flicker of a second, it felt like he was the only guy in\
  \ the bar and he stood out, he looked controlled and there was a stillness to him.\
  \ I could feel him staring at me and we locked eyes. I liked it but I stood frozen\
  \ hoping he\u2019d walk over or I would have the nerve to walk over to him. Suddenly,\
  \ he was no longer in my vision. A muscular boy with an athletic body stepped in\
  \ front of him and pulled him close. I was no longer in his sight and their bodies\
  \ drunkenly pressed against each other. My stomach sank and I felt like the last\
  \ kid picked on the baseball team.  I stepped back and faded into the sea of people,\
  \ alone. \n\nSunday June 11\n\nThe next day at the beach, I notice a guy with a\
  \ tanned muscular back. It is the guy from last night. I pretend not to see him\
  \ but he looks directly at me and nodded his head to acknowledge me. He approaches.\
  \ \n\n\u201CDo you have a boyfriend\u201D Tiago abruptly asked. \u201CNo, I don\u2019\
  t\u201D I replied. Tiago half smiles then nods \u201COk lets go for dinner this\
  \ week, I\u2019ll put my number in your phone.\u201D \n\nTiago and his friends pack\
  \ up to leave, he looks over his shoulder and mouths bye with a wave. I wave back\
  \ and smirk, I didn\u2019t want to be obvious but my attraction for him was written\
  \ on my face. \n\n\nWednesday August 31\n\nThe summer is almost over. \n\nI drove\
  \ my scooter to Jo\xE3o de Arens. The seashell shaped beach where Tiago and I spent\
  \ so many Saturdays and after work evenings. We would swim out to the caves and\
  \ swim from the sea boulders where we would stand with our feet pressed against\
  \ each other and I would wrap my arms around his waist for balance. \n\nI wrote\
  \ a letter to Tiago about how I wanted him to be happy and how I liked the gap between\
  \ his teeth, the way he said my name and when I realized I loved him. \n\nI buried\
  \ that note above the beach. One day I\u2019ll come back to Portugal with him and\
  \ find this letter and let him read it. \n\nFriday September 11\n\nTiago drove me\
  \ to the bus station. It was 6am and the sun was rising. The orange sun drenched\
  \ the landscape as we waited for my bus to take me to Lisbon. \n\nWe sat in his\
  \ car with our hands interlocked, saying nothing. \n\nPeople were boarding the bus\
  \ and I waited to get on. Tiago pulled me close to him and said, \u201CPaul, I adore\
  \ you\u201D and kissed me. I told him I would miss him and I got on the bus. He\
  \ waited there until we pulled away. \n\nAnd just like that I was going home. \n\
  \nI cried a lot on that bus and the crushing reality of losing someone that I loved\
  \ started to sink in. I turned up my music to distract my mind and rubbed the palm\
  \ of my hand. I wanted to not feel this. I wanted to deny my feelings and appreciate\
  \ this moment for a summer romance and let it stop there.  I wanted to feel the\
  \ happiness I had when I was alone. I wanted to feel like I was just passing by\
  \ and this was a fleeting moment. I wanted Tiago to not have to touch my hand under\
  \ the table where we ate dinner. I wanted him to feel who he loved wasn\u2019t wrong\
  \ or should be concealed. I wanted a different ending. \n\nI wanted to be undone\
  \ of this ache."
