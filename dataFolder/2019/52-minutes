Text: "52 Minutes\n\nThe last time he was at this airport, my father was a child looking\
  \ at the maletas his parents clutched as the guards forced my abuela to remove her\
  \ jewelry, before they left home for good. \n\nBefore I boarded my flight, we met\
  \ for lunch at a diner near the Ft. Lauderdale airport. My abuela\u2014sad she couldn\u2019\
  t join me on the trip; my father\u2014scared I might not return home. \n\nOn the\
  \ flight, I filled out our visas. My name set me apart from my family. The Medical\
  \ Card asked me if I\u2019d been around anyone who\u2019d had a runny nose. The\
  \ customs form told me I didn\u2019t have to declare the money I brought. \n\nWhen\
  \ we landed, we walked through passport control, Violet and I, and the officer asked\
  \ me how to pronounce my name.\n\n\u201CMichelle,\u201D I replied. \n\n\u201CAh,\
  \ hablas espa\xF1ol?\u201D she asked. \n\n\u201CSi, un pocito.\u201D \n\nWe took\
  \ our pictures, got our stamps, and walked through the scanners to baggage claim.\
  \ \n\nThere were two belts snaking their way across the room, each lined with saran-wrapped\
  \ maletas, diamond and aquamarine chests filled with clothes and toilet paper and\
  \ food. It took an hour for our bags to come through. Then we turned in our customs\
  \ form and walked outside.\n\nMy abuela\u2019s nieces, my mother\u2019s cousins,\
  \ my cousins really, met us outside, along with a hoard of other families and cabbies\
  \ and chauffeurs.\nCelene looks like my abuela but darker. She has the same black\
  \ curls my mother had, the same brown skin my sister has when she spends more than\
  \ 30 minutes outside, the same pointed noise my abuela has. \n\nWe exchanged some\
  \ money, hopped in a taxi, and drove to my cousin\u2019s neighborhood. Brutalist\
  \ apartment buildings, painted peach and mint and sky, lined the street. We drove\
  \ around pot holes and broken streets, entered one of these boxy buildings, and\
  \ toasted to the reunion. \n\nMy son played with his cousin. My daughter begged\
  \ for a sip of Nectarine juice. I watched the neighborhood kids play soccer, pausing\
  \ as a car passed. \n\nThe flight only took 52 minutes to get here; It took me a\
  \ lifetime to return."
