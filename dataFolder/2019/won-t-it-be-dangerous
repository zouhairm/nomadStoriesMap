Text: "Are you sure to leave?\nYes,I want to take my Milan-Colombo flight with my\
  \ partner, our 3 years toddler and my 6 months old belly.\nTraveling as backpackers\
  \ it means a backpack and quite nothing else; the image of the luggages in front\
  \ of the door before departure is not exactly reassuring.\nBut we finally land and\
  \ the first curry breath was enough to take away our worries.\nWe immediately move\
  \ to our seafront Negombo guest house. Here, as everywhere in this country, by booking\
  \ a little in advance, you can have a delicious dinner of freshly caught fish accompanied\
  \ by the spicier rice curry. You will always find a smile and great helpfulness\
  \ to satisfy even the youngest of western travelers who are not accustomed to such\
  \ strong tastes.\nIn the same easy way we were able to organize any trips and accommodations\
  \ at the last second. Even the most unexpected situation in Sri Lanka can be an\
  \ opportunity.\nBeing in the middle of the Perahera, a very important Buddhist manifestation,\
  \ in the cultural capital of the country can be somewhat uncomfortable. Visiting\
  \ the Kandy tooth temple in those days was a bit crowded but otherwise would have\
  \ we visited the most beautiful botanical gardens ever seen to escape the crowds?\n\
  To anyone who is leaving for this green country and wants to undertake one of the\
  \ most exciting experiences of their life, I recommend trying to get on the train\
  \ that goes from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya.\nIf you have not booked a ticket through\
  \ an agency you will find yourself holding a small and very cheap piece of paper\
  \ that corresponds to a second or third class ticket.\nWhen the train arrives on\
  \ the tracks it is already full and flagging my pregnancy or my little girl not\
  \ helped, the train leaves without us.\nBefore leaving I filled my eyes with images\
  \ of the valleys of tea and I can't just give up.\nAm I or am I not Italian with\
  \ southern origins?\nWhen I find myself again in front of the train door I literally\
  \ launch the stroller between people and with some other agile move I jump on that\
  \ train. Here we are.\nFollowing 4 hot hours in which we make room among the others\
  \ and we sit on our backpacks that for the occasion become very comfortable armchairs.\
  \ We are in the third class and around us there are every day travelers, vendors\
  \ of all sorts of fried food, families, also some other backpackers.\nThe doors\
  \ of the train are strictly open so as to make room for those who want to travel\
  \ with dangling feet. It is the most coveted position; when I manage to conquer\
  \ it for a few minutes I understand why. I sit holding myself up to the side handles\
  \ and look out: I feel flying.\nWhen in Nuwara Eliya it seems to have arrived in\
  \ some remote region of Great Britain because we're immersed in the fog and welcomed\
  \ in a wooden cottage where a cup of hot tea is waiting for us.\nThe first discovery\
  \ it was few minutes walk from the place where we slept. We follow a path that passes\
  \ right in the middle of a tea plantation. We turn around a hill and pass by a small\
  \ shrine dedicated to Shiva. The falls are heralded by their unmistakable noise.\
  \ The Lovers Leap are so called because a legend tells that a couple of lovers threw\
  \ themselves into its waters to escape from the family that doesn't want them together.\n\
  We look into each other's eyes and we know that the snapshot of this moment will\
  \ be the symbol of our journey in our memory.\nOur adventure has not ended, we\u2019\
  re expecting for other trains, surf classes, safaris, pristine beaches, snorkeling,\
  \ historic cities and hills topped by ancient ruins.\nThat waterfall with its romantic\
  \ legend is the image of our leap into the unknown. It is a leap for lovers: life,\
  \ world and adventure lovers."
