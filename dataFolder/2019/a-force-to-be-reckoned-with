Text: "\u201CWhy do you like to travel on your own?\u201D they always ask; as I sit\
  \ there and think of an inspiring speech to convince others to travel on their own.\
  \ The answer is clear; I travel alone to inspire myself. \n\nCountry to country,\
  \ city to city, I find myself in each new place I visit. Two years ago when deciding\
  \ to travel to Europe on my own, I didn\u2019t expect to find myself. When my feet\
  \ touched down in a foreign country, it hit me. I was on my own. I planned my way\
  \ from start to finish on how to get here; and now it\u2019s time for an adventure.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYou don\u2019t need to have a plan for everything\u201D I tell myself.\
  \ I put my phone in my bag and instantly jumped out of my comfort zone and began\
  \ finding my way through an unknown city \u2013 from the airport to my hotel \u2013\
  \ no technology. \n\nNo hiding behind an online map. No pretending to be texting\
  \ or talking on the phone; to make myself look less of a tourist, in spite of my\
  \ luggage trailing behind me. I was on my own, I didn\u2019t need to plan this.\
  \ Get out of your comfort zone. Walk up to that woman sitting on the bench waiting\
  \ for her train and ask her for directions. Get off your phone. \n\nFast forward\
  \ two and a half hours later; I made it to my hotel. I run to the window to see\
  \ the view, as I watch the double decker buses I always saw in movies, pass by but\
  \ now in real life. Seeing the old, beautiful buildings; the beautiful, luscious\
  \ green parks. \n\n\u201CWhy did I choose to do this on my own?\u201D I ask myself,\
  \ with the quick realization that I did this to find myself. \n\nNew countries,\
  \ new cities, new people, new foods and new experiences. I did this to grow. I needed\
  \ to forget about my every day routine back home and visit a place I only ever saw\
  \ through a screen yet yearned for deeply. It was time to take action. \n\n\u201C\
  Get out of your comfort zone\u201D I said. \u201CGo outside. Find a coffee shop.\
  \ Be alone. Be present.\u201D \n\nThe days passed, as I continued to check cities\
  \ off my bucket list. While being able to add new and strengthened aspects about\
  \ myself to my list. The timid, quiet girl was a person of the past. I\u2019m letting\
  \ go of her; as I immersed myself into experiences I never imagined doing. Eating\
  \ a pork knuckle in Germany, indulging in snails through Paris, exploring the Swiss\
  \ Alps and white water rafting in Austria. Through all these experiences, in new\
  \ territories with new people; I found myself. \n\nFourteen days later, I returned\
  \ home, and something was different. My work, my home, my family and friends were\
  \ all the same; but something was different. I was different. \n\nI had dreams and\
  \ goals I wanted to achieve, and I had the fire to do it. The Monday to Friday was\
  \ no longer sufficient. I need new, I need different.  I became open to the idea\
  \ of the unknown, I became fearless to the idea of the unknown. One year later,\
  \ I handed in my resignation and began a new career. A career that aligns with my\
  \ beliefs; a career that allows me to open up the world for those who want to see\
  \ it. \n\nThe fire I had when returning from Europe hasn\u2019t been put out. My\
  \ conversations with strangers on a daily basis, sharing travel stories just adds\
  \ fuel to the fire. Two years later, everyone still asks \u201CWhy do you like to\
  \ travel alone?\u201D I reply \u201CI didn\u2019t expect to find myself; but I did.\
  \ New places, new people, new experiences, new me.\u201D \n\nThe fire continues\
  \ to burn; a force to be reckoned with. \nThis world is too big to be standing still,\
  \ it\u2019s time to move; onto bigger and better things. \n\nI encourage those of\
  \ all ages to get out and travel alone, it is only than that you will truly find\
  \ yourself. \n\nI didn't expect to find myself, but I did. I'm living this one life\
  \ and making every step count."
