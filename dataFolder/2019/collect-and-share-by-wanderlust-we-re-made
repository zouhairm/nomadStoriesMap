Text: "\u201CLets go to road trip in La baja\u201D Romina said. \u201CI\u2019ve gone\
  \ twice\u201D, I said. \u201CBut you know it\u2019s never the same thing, trust\
  \ me.\u201D\nI was trying to save money for travel, didn\u2019t know where but saving\
  \ for travel was my status, so I really doubt on going. Then I thought on the Carpe\
  \ Diem thing, my best friend is going and I trust her. \nSo the plan was getting\
  \ down from La paz to Los Cabos by the Atlantic Ocean side, and gone up to La paz\
  \ again but by the Golfo Ocean side.\nI always remember us, Romina and I boarding\
  \ in Guadalajara\u2019s airport with our big backpacks and jorongo\u2019s  (Typical\
  \ outerwear in Mexico that we\u2019ve bought in Guanajuato when we go to the Cervantino\
  \ festival) ready for our first fly, of many, together.\n\nEarly next morning, after\
  \ a night in the cheapest and nearest hostel to the bus station we could found,\
  \ as we arrived late at night. With the amazing surprise that for being students\
  \ and still dates considers as holiday\u2019s (first days of January) we had 50%\
  \ discount on bus tickets, point for the students.\n\nAfter have walked though the\
  \ colorful town of Todos Santos, get in to some artisans stores, visited the famous\
  \ Hotel California, we bought some fruit for breakfast and stop in a corner to take\
  \ a breath from the sun and from our backpacks, to eat and to admire the architecture,\
  \ the view of the ocean at distance, the fresh dessert wind. \n\nIndeed we wanted\
  \ the sea, so we took a cap, as there were not other ways to reach this virgin hidden\
  \ beach that some friends we were catching up later have told us to visit. The highway\
  \ was watching the brown dry colors of the dessert, after we got in to a road that\
  \ was all sand where we discovered the biggest cactus we have ever viewed being\
  \ an essential part of this dessert landscape.\nTo get to the beach we have to walk\
  \ through a beautiful path, with a big hill at our left, and like a little jungle\
  \ of green vegetation at our right, this was divide for a path of sand with some\
  \ tall palms. \nLiterally we ran to the sea, pouring out joy and energy. I stop\
  \ abruptly because water was super cold but Romina didn\u2019t, she just keep running\
  \ and then she jump and dive as if the water were just on point, she got out laughing\
  \ and saying that the water was perfect. I was impressive and I asked her why she\
  \ said that if I my feet was frizzed, so she just tell me, as if were obvious, to\
  \ do the same thing and that it wouldn\u2019t feel that bad. So I followed, and\
  \ those next seconds, I feel the adrenaline and the coldness frizzing my body but\
  \ with each step I feel more excited, was like feeling each part of my frozen, active\
  \ body the type of cold that keeps you awake, and by the inside my heart was bumping\
  \ strongly like a type of burning, I felt so alive.\nNever thought feel the adrenaline\
  \ like this, but thanks to R I did. Thats the power of travel with the right person,\
  \ being exposed to shared the experience, to shared your way of living the moment.\
  \ To jump and dive. \n\nLater on the trip, when she saw me climbing some rocks that\
  \ look very tall and without much of were to grab on. Her confort zone was to stay\
  \ down that was already a pretty good view, but she went up and feel the free spirit\
  \ vibe of being at the top of the tallest rock cliff in the very edge of La Baja.\
  \ So we both shared our ways of travel and encourage each other to leave a invisible\
  \ comfort zone, the one that we didn\u2019t even know that exist.\n\nThat was what\
  \ I din\u2019t expected to find, because lately I\u2019m more used to do solo travel\
  \ and I love it, but from that trip, was the first time I notice we were made friends\
  \ to share, among many things, our passion for wanderlust."
