Text: "I was holding my breath. No one else was breathing either. The fire crackled,\
  \ and an animal screeched somewhere in the dark behind us. We barely noticed. We\
  \ were glued to Ntirra, the flames glinting in his mischievous eyes. \n\n\u201C\
  The lioness had been stalking me, and I was about to become her prey,\u201D he murmured.\
  \ \n\nWe\u2019d been out in the jeep all day, cruising the spectacular Maasai Mara.\
  \ We\u2019d seen naughty hyenas and tiny baby warthogs, majestic elephants, hungry\
  \ giraffes and lazy hippos. We had finally witnessed the breathtaking wildebeest\
  \ migration after days of expectant waiting at the river\u2019s edge. We\u2019d\
  \ even seen an elusive leopard try his luck at picking off a young calf, only to\
  \ get himself struck by a wayward hoof and slink shamefacedly back to his tree.\
  \ \n\nBut it was Ntirra\u2019s story that had us enthralled tonight. His dark eyes\
  \ gleamed in the warm light of the fire. He paused for effect. He adjusted his red\
  \ sh\xFAk\xE0. He smiled. We waited, as he knew we would. \n\n\u201CThe only thing\
  \ between me and a very painful death was the chair I\u2019d been fixing. I had\
  \ to think quick!\u201D As he spoke, Ntirra\u2019s graceful hands punctuated his\
  \ story. He was clearly enjoying our reactions. \u201CShe was looking me right in\
  \ the eyes. I knew I couldn\u2019t run or show any fear. That would mean certain\
  \ death! What could I do?\u201D\n\nThis was Ntirra\u2019s home, his normal, and\
  \ it was a world away from my own. He\u2019d been telling incredible stories of\
  \ his close encounters all week, like the time he had to chase a stray elephant\
  \ out of camp without it trampling any tents, or the time a baboon stole someone\u2019\
  s entire suitcase and went squealing off into the trees. I had enjoyed hearing about\
  \ his life here in the wild, unpredictable game reserve. \n\nAnd he was curious\
  \ about our lives, too. I told him about my apartment, my job, that I can walk to\
  \ the beach and my favourite caf\xE9. He wanted to know about the environment, the\
  \ wildlife. Had we had any close encounters? Unless you count the time a bush turkey\
  \ launched itself at my head or when I found a huntsman spider in the toilet, then\
  \ no. Nothing like lions and elephants and monkeys, but Ntirra was interested just\
  \ the same. \n\nHe showed me photos of his family, and I showed him mine. I showed\
  \ him pictures of my dog, and he told me about an injured baby gazelle he was raising.\
  \ He took me to visit his home, a mudbrick hut with a thatched roof. I told him\
  \ about my local beach and how I like to sit and watch the whales from the headland\
  \ (another encounter with wildlife, sort of?). Ntirra\u2019s face lit up every time\
  \ I told him something new about my home, eyes wide with awe. \n\nI imagine I looked\
  \ exactly the same as he was telling this story. \u201CI knew I had to make myself\
  \ big and scary,\u201D Ntirra continued. \u201CI moved fast. I grabbed the chair,\
  \ waved it around in the air and started yelling very loudly!\u201D As he spoke,\
  \ he shot up and threw his arms above his head. We all jumped in our seats, and\
  \ he let out a big belly laugh. \n\nThe lioness, it seems, was just as startled\
  \ as we were. \u201CShe was up on all fours in a second, and her eyes never left\
  \ me. Suddenly, I ran at her as fast as I could, screaming at the top of my lungs!\u201D\
  \ Ntirra paused, arms outstretched and panting. \u201CShe fled,\u201D he said simply,\
  \ \u201Cand I went back to fixing the chair.\u201D \n\nThe applause was full and\
  \ enthusiastic, and Ntirra smiled, gave us a quick bow and sat down as we began\
  \ to chat amongst ourselves again. \n\nI was overwhelmed by the difference of it\
  \ all. Lions versus bush turkeys, gazelles versus dogs, someone else\u2019s normal\
  \ versus my own. This is why we travel, I remember thinking. Experiences, adventures,\
  \ stories, connections, memories. Heart still thumping, I sat back and breathed\
  \ it all in, excited for tomorrow."
