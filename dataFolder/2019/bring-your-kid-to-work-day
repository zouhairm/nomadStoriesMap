Text: "We were eating tacos at a rickety table on the street, in the Roma District\
  \ of Mexico City. Denis had put too much habanero sauce on them (\u201CIt\u2019\
  ll clean out your gut!\u201D), and both of us were panting like dogs in an attempt\
  \ to cool our mouths. I looked to the man running the taco stand for water. He just\
  \ scratched his straw hat and shrugged, betraying a faint grin.\nMy legs were sore\
  \ and my feet blistered, my body battered after our blitz up Iztacc\xEDhuatl, Mexico\u2019\
  s third highest peak, in the preceding days. To make matters worse, Denis and I\
  \ had only brought beans up the mountain for sustenance, in four deceptively small\
  \ packets that actually amounted to thirty-eight servings, and my stomach was a\
  \ nuclear wasteland.\n\u201CCan\u2019t really complain about the effect it\u2019\
  s had on the economy,\u201D Denis was saying. He scratched at his thick, black beard.\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s all words, but what can you do when the policy is sound? Sometimes\
  \ assholes know what\u2019s up.\u201D\nI didn\u2019t really remember what he was\
  \ talking about. Something about the government and Reddit posts and cryptocurrency.\
  \ Denis talked quickly and often. Conversations with him were the verbal equivalent\
  \ of a small dog running circles around your heels.\n\u201CNow division, intersectionality,\
  \ that stuff\u2019s key,\u201D he said. \u201CIt\u2019s what\u2019s bringing people\
  \ down, all these identifiers. Separators, you know?\u201D\n\u201CYeah,\u201D I\
  \ said. \u201CSeparators. Us against them, is that what you mean?\u201D\n\u201C\
  No no no, not really. See, it\u2019s more like a de-blending of identities, compartmentalization\u2026\
  \u201D \nDenis was gesturing with his tanned arms. I turned my gaze slightly to\
  \ the right. Thin, leafy tree branches hung low over the cobbled street. They were\
  \ a verdant green, and they swung gently in the breeze coming from the north. A\
  \ woman was approaching from this direction. She was stooped double, and her canvas\
  \ coat was far too large, hanging over her shoulders like the wings of a seraphim\
  \ long-retired. Her black hair was wrapped in a shawl, no strands escaped.\nThe\
  \ woman was selling Chiclets. They were stuffed into a shallow, open cardboard box.\
  \ A box like that might have once been used to hold shoes, or jars of jam, or unwanted\
  \ children left at doorsteps. \nNow it held Chiclets.\nChiclets, for readers who\
  \ do not know, are an infuriating brand of gum sold in Mexican restaurants at the\
  \ register and on streets throughout Latin America. They come in a packet the size\
  \ of a thimble, and lose all flavor approximately two seconds after one begins to\
  \ chew them. I do not like Chiclets, and I did not buy a packet of Chiclets for\
  \ three pesos from the woman in the canvas coat. She continued down the street.\
  \ I could now see that an infant hung from her back in a sling, looking out pensively\
  \ into the fading sunlight of dusk.\nDenis ate three more tacos sans sauce. I listened\
  \ to him talk about rugby practice and his new van and his little brother causing\
  \ his dad trouble and the ethics of drone warfare, and I watched the woman continue\
  \ her march. She sold Chiclets to two giggling women in sunhats. An old man with\
  \ a thin grey beard reading a newspaper would not acknowledge her. A group of children\
  \ passed and she did not offer them Chiclets. A young man with a woman on his arm\
  \ ignored her. Another did not. \nThe baby in the sling on her back looked out.\
  \ I wondered if it would have eaten the extra beans Denis and I had spooned out\
  \ onto the glacier the day before. I could not tell if the infant was looking at\
  \ me, and I could not tell if it was male or female. Its eyes were very dark and\
  \ small. They looked far older than the streets it was being carried through."
