Text: "Last year's autumn none of us had any idea about Iceland; we knew it for its\
  \ football team successes and being a popular travel destination. Nevertheless,\
  \ a hobby we had - lurking the cheap flights search engines - was about to change\
  \ it. Somewhere around September 2018 one of us was scrolling Skyscanner and ended\
  \ up with a brilliant discovery - tickets to Keflavik that were not ruining our\
  \ budgets. We didn't hesitate. Exploring something we didn't know anything about?\
  \ No need to ask twice.\n\nThere were four of us: me, Annie (who found the tickets),\
  \ Kacper and his girlfriend, Greta. As our knowledge about Iceland was limited,\
  \ we started to pick random locations that we wished to visit. Soon it turned out\
  \ that we would need a roadtrip around the whole country. Yeah, why not, we thought.\
  \ \n\nOnce we landed in Keflavik airport and took our all wheel drive vehicle (if\
  \ you want to drive in Iceland, never pick a car that can't climb mountains) an\
  \ out-of-this world feeling arose. A moon-like landscape was our scenery for the\
  \ next 6 days. Nobody complained.\n\nReykjavik, our first stop, is home for nearly\
  \ half of Iceland's population. Still, it has just 123 thousand inhabitants. When\
  \ I think of it now, the first phrase that comes to my mind is \"peace and order\"\
  . It feels like taking care of the city was one of the life principles of Reykjavikers.\
  \ There was no possibility to feel uncomfortable in this scenery. Clean streets,\
  \ lack of crowds, houses painted with lively colors. Even kerbstones had some kind\
  \ of charm. Nordic architecture, stunning bay views and general calmness made us\
  \ love it. Ah, and we got free beers at the hostel. Icelandic hospitality never\
  \ let us down in Reykjavik. However, it ended in the moment we left the capital.\
  \ Is the rest of Icelanders less welcoming than Reykjavik citizens? I suppose not.\
  \ There were simply no people on our way.\n\nOf course, that's a slight exaggeration\
  \ but Iceland is one of the few countries, where you can be on the move for hours\
  \ and not meet a single human being. Except the famous tourist spots, which we limited\
  \ to the absolute minimum. There was something fascinating about being free to go\
  \ anywhere, stop at mind-blowing locations any time we wanted to, and not being\
  \ bothered by anyone. Admiring the nature in absolute silence. Just living the moments\
  \ with your closest (and only) companions. And, sometimes, reindeers.\n\nDay by\
  \ day, we were getting more and more excited about the freedom we suddenly got.\
  \ Although the car navigation kept on reminding us of reality, we felt as if we\
  \ were in an endless land of waterfalls, mountains, geysers and relaxing silence.\
  \ It didn't matter if we drove 300 or 1000 kilometres in a day. It didn't matter\
  \ if we were watching mountain ranges way head of us, or were trying to find the\
  \ contour of the road while driving slowly in a snowstorm. We were freezing to death\
  \ at night trying to spot northern lights, yet we loved it. Getting deeper into\
  \ an unknown, beautiful space was thrilling, and we couldn't give this thrill up.\
  \ At the same time, all of us experienced some kind of relax. A real one. Considering\
  \ how Iceland looks like - nothing else could have happened.\n\nOur roadtrip in\
  \ Iceland took 6 days, during which we travelled round the whole country, exploring\
  \ it step by step. On the last day, we strolled again on the streets of Reykjavik\
  \ and felt this for the last time - deep, Icelandic cooldown. Which, I guess, was\
  \ our most important discovery."
