Text: "I arrived in Athens with my husband, three young children, a push chair and\
  \ eleven pieces of luggage.  The main goal was to get to Amouliani, an island off\
  \ the third finger of Khalkidhiki, on the way meeting up with my Mother and sister\
  \ in Thessaloniki. Visiting Amouliani again was a self-indulgent desire, a way to\
  \ revisit my 16-year-old self. Travelling with children is always a leap into the\
  \ unknown, especially coming from New Zealand, when plane journeys are exhausting.\
  \ Within the first two hours I had coffee down the front of my white t-shirt and\
  \ orange juice over my seat and cardigan. \nMy husband had trouble with the Greek\
  \ accent and the waiter at a caf\xE9 on route to the Acropolis looked most disgruntled\
  \ when he offered \u2018orange juice\u2019 and the reply was \u2018Yes, we will\
  \ come in and choose\u2019. We made use of the portable toilet in the square which\
  \ sprayed us with blue disinfectant much to the amusement of the children.\nOn the\
  \ bus from Athens to Thessaloniki we met George, a very chatty tie designer.  He\
  \ translated for everyone one on the bus, shouting things up to the front, which\
  \ were acknowledged with nods and murmurs or a little laughter and gesticulations.\
  \  We just kept smiling at everyone.  We passed Mount Olympus looking very impressive\
  \ shrouded in mist.  \nGeorge sorted a taxi for us in Thessaloniki, telling the\
  \ driver not to rip us off and we were taken to our rendezvous - Hotel Amelia. \
  \ Thessaloniki is a beautiful city with all the wide streets leading down to the\
  \ ocean.  Early morning lively markets and a stillness in the mid afternoon when\
  \ the hustle and bustle seem to dissipate.  \nWe caught a bus to the ferry terminal\
  \ of Tripiti, my sister trying to look as if she wasn\u2019t part of our group.\
  \  The bus trip was delightful with the countryside here much prettier and more\
  \ fertile, with lots of wild flowers, goats and fields of barley.  Then we climbed\
  \ up into the mountains, the bus groaning under the weight of passengers, and then\
  \ over the top and downward to the sea and along the coast.  We made it to Tripti\
  \ in time for the 11.30 ferry.  I smiled as I stood on the deck looking towards\
  \ the Lilliputian cluster of buildings I remembered so well.\nWe arrived in the\
  \ scorching heat of midday, my Mother still wearing a large woollen overcoat that\
  \ she had brought with her \u2018just in case\u2019, and we set off the find our\
  \ lodgings.  We asked in the supermarket and the owner went to \u2018phone someone\
  \ and before long a beaming lady appeared with open arms and fond embraces.  She\
  \ procured an old VW van and my sister, I and the three children piled into it with\
  \ all the luggage.  My Mother had found the shade of an olive tree and waited with\
  \ my husband, a staunch look set on her face.  We had a hairy ride up the hill with\
  \ the children hanging on for dear life and Megan and I worried that the bags would\
  \ fly out of the open door.  We kept smiling whilst watching a small bag slide bit\
  \ by bit towards the door, but arrived just in time, screeching to a holt, throwing\
  \ us all backwards.  \nOur balcony overlooked the sea on three sides and we watched\
  \ the ferry come in and out, and fishermen bring in their catch, the vividly painted\
  \ boats oscillating at the jetty.  The passing of 22 years seemed to have altered\
  \ very little, I could have once again been 16 and full of the dreams I had then.\
  \  Yes, there were more buildings, cars and motorbikes, but the quintessence of\
  \ it was still there.  The tranquillity of siesta time, with only a few people at\
  \ the waterfront, their conversation and laughter drifting up the hill.  They, too,\
  \ soon disappeared into the shelter of the shade, out of the burning heat, the scent\
  \ of which I remembered too.  \nWe didn\u2019t know whether we would able to travel\
  \ with three young children, it was unknown territory for us, but we sallied forth\
  \ regardless and it was wonderful.  Hard work, but wonderful!"
