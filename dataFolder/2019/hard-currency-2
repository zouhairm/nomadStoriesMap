Text: "HARD CURRENCY\n\nA short documentation of street vendors in the province of\_\
  Luanda.\n\nI spent two months back home in Angola after my recent graduation. Usually\
  \ I wouldn't spend more than two weeks as the thought of leaving Europe to return\
  \ to a politically unstable country made me feel uneasy. But this time I was determined\
  \ to really reconnect with culture and open my eyes to the current situations happening\
  \ around me.\n\nFor those who don't know, Angola was a former colony of Portugal\
  \ and much like the rest of Africa, has conquered its independence through violence,\
  \ undergoing years of war, grief and only fairly recently begun rebuilding itself.\
  \ There is also a huge gap between rich and poor, which makes the city of Luanda\
  \ the most expensive city in the world. In spite of all negative factors, there\
  \ is much to be grateful for. My country is blessed with wonderful lands, exotic\
  \ fauna and flora, vibrant culture and people, who have a lot to offer, a contained\
  \ potential.\n\nSo for two months, I observed the streets, the people, the daily\
  \ quotidian of society and documented it through my photography as well as my travel\
  \ diary. I was particularly determined to engage with the locals, as I felt that\
  \ was the most genuine way to really get to know my culture and the people of my\
  \ country. And so I began a short documentation of beach & street vendors around\
  \ the province of Luanda. In Angola, much like the rest of world,\_the profession\
  \ of beach & street vendors is highly competitive and has since 2018 been prohibited\
  \ by law. The fascinating thing about this profession is the merchandise,\_one would\
  \ not believe the variety of goods made available to us  out in the open; you can\
  \ quite literally find anything you need being sold on streets, beaches, side roads,\
  \ traffic roads and many other public areas. It ranges from fresh food, domestic\
  \ and cleaning products to automobile parts and tech\_gadgets.\_\n\nI observed countless\
  \ vendors, from different\_ages and locations. I\_documented as many vendors as\
  \ I could, often\_speaking to them and inquiring about their selling goods\_and\
  \ their origins.\_As one can imagine,\_tough as it is to try make it as a vendor,\
  \ there is also the fact that this has\_become an inconvenience to society- whether\
  \ they're badgering clients\_to buy or setting up \"business\" in front of banks,\
  \ petrol stations or even selling\_overpriced national\_goods-\_the\_fact remains\
  \ that in most cases, these products are acquired illegally, without any assurance\
  \ of safety and legitimacy.\_\n\nI understand the reasons why the government made\
  \ a stand against vendor activities, from a legal and social point of view, it's\
  \ been placed to reinforce laws, ensure good conduct of trade and protect society\
  \ from chaotic exposure.\_However, part of me feels differently. The fact is\_that\
  \ most vendors come from poor\_backgrounds,\_with very little (if none)\_choice\
  \ to do something else; they take whatever they can sell and make a business of\
  \ it. Although some may be lawless, others only try to fend for themselves and make\
  \ a living because in a city as expensive as Luanda, there are still people living\
  \ under a dollar a day when the average monthly living cost is about 3'000 usd.\
  \ In the few honest ones that an opportunity to engage in conversation with,\_I\_\
  see an\_insatiable perseverance, behind their poker faces it\_can be easy to forget\
  \ their hardship. It is a seriously judged job, one\_in which very little consideration\
  \ is\_taken\_in trying to understand\_their side and\_which brings very little change\
  \ to a life that is already considered arduous.\n\n\nThank you for reading and I\
  \ hope this brief story has kept you wanting to know more about this country and\
  \ its people. So much can go unnoticed and so many unheard. Sometimes all it takes\
  \ is for someone to take a moment and ask a question, the rest will unravel itself\
  \ naturally. \n\n\nYours Kindly, \nAna Karenina"
