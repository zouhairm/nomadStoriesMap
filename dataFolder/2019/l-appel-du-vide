Text: "L'appel du vide. The call of the void. As I stood atop the cliffs of Cachoeir\xE3\
  o por cima in Vale do Pati, Brazil, I couldn't help but feel the urge to leap into\
  \ the valley bellow. \n\n\"I know I sound crazy, but does anyone else feel like\
  \ they kind of want to jump into it?\"\n\"You feel it too?\"\n\"Yeah, it's intense.\
  \ Like it's pulling me.\"\n\nAfter two days of hiking from the small village of\
  \ Vale do Cap\xE3o we reached a viewpoint unlike any I have ever experienced before.\
  \ The trek there was relatively easy, consisting mostly of a long walk over a relatively\
  \ flat plateau with small arid shrubs. The lookout took us by surprise as we had\
  \ only been told to expect a waterfall of some kind. We broke through some tall\
  \ grasses and the ground ahead suddenly gave way to a deep chasm. It was an incredible\
  \ drop hundreds of metres long culminating in a small river surrounded by lush vegitation.\
  \ The valley stretched before us for kilometres and I was taken aback by how suddenly\
  \ the scenery had changed. Here we were standing on what appeared to be a flat desert,\
  \ whilst four hundred metres bellow there was a dense jungle with waterfalls cascading\
  \ from the clifftops above. Looking at the layers of the valley was far more satisfying\
  \ than seeing a multi-layed cake being cut into on Instagram, and our eyes devoured\
  \ it hungrily.\n\nAs we sat in silence I slowly felt this urge come over me; to\
  \ simply run over the edge and allow myself to fly into the unknown. It was a calm\
  \ feeling, as if I could just float into the valley. Logically I knew this to be\
  \ impossible, but for some reason it felt plausible. The universe would allow me\
  \ to drift upon the aircurrents like a feather and I would land safely in the canopy\
  \ bellow to join the marmosets and parrots. Instead, I crawled on my belly right\
  \ to the edge and allowed myself to peer over the edge.\n\n\"Stay away from precipices!\"\
  \ I could hear my mothers voice echo in my head. The shock reeled me away from the\
  \ edge to a much safer distance and I took in the sights of the valley with my friends.\
  \ The feeling of sheer insignificance overwhelmed us and we admired the beauty for\
  \ hours. \n\nIn the end I couldn't resist and I had to take some photographs to\
  \ immortalise the moment. A few days later I recieved some alarmed texts from home\
  \ \"Don't be an idiot! That is far too dangerous, what if someone tries to take\
  \ photos on the edge and hurts themselves!\" I assured my mum we were safe and promised\
  \ to take care of myself. I made the error of posting more photos however, and I\
  \ recieved a record-breaking four texts from my parents in two days - an impressive\
  \ feat for two people seemingly allergic to technology. \n\nMonths later I can still\
  \ feel the pull of the valley. The promise of hidden lands. Adventures waiting to\
  \ be had. But perhaps next time, when the void calls me, I'd prefer to do it with\
  \ a parachute on hand."
