Text: "Some say that Chefchaouen was painted blue by the Jews who were fleeing persecution.\
  \ Blue, in Judaism, represents the skies and the heavens.\n\nHopping off the bus\
  \ from Casablanca, I arrived in Chefchaouen without expecting much. Sure, it was\
  \ on my \u2018to go\u2019 list for Morocco because of those nearly mystical photographs\
  \ of the picturesque blue streets.\n\nFrom what I understood, the Jews were looking\
  \ for a safe haven from the persecution in Europe. They were in search for heaven,\
  \ so they painted the town blue\u2014quite literally.\n\nAs for me, it was the contrary,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t looking for heaven. To be truthful, I had no idea what I was looking\
  \ for. I was always the one who was the first to leave, or the one who will try\
  \ to not get attached to a place nor person. I wasn\u2019t looking for heaven.\n\
  \nThe local hostel introduced me to a group of amazing people: Cira, Saniya, Josh,\
  \ and Jack. We were from different parts of the world, with entirely different backgrounds.\
  \ Our common ground was a search for the unknown.\n\nOne day, we were planning on\
  \ going to this nearby waterfall called Akchour. It was about half a dozen miles\
  \ from Chefchaouen. We originally planned to grab a taxi, but haggling with Moroccan\
  \ taxi drivers required a special skill. We mastered our haggling skills the night\
  \ prior, and off we were when morning came.\n\nBut before we left the hostel, we\
  \ were greeted by a our local friend, Mohammed.\n\n\u201CMy friend wants to go with\
  \ you,\u201D he announced as he pointed at the skinny, long-haired Slovenian guy\
  \ hovering beside him.\n\nWe all agreed to take him\u2014Robbie was his name.\n\n\
  As we set out in search for a taxi, Mohammed stopped us, \u201CWhere are you going?\u201D\
  \n\nConfused, we answered in unison, \u201CTo catch a taxi.\u201D\n\nRobbie laughed\
  \ and Mohammed pointed at the camper van parked beside the hostel.\n\n\u201CHe drives\
  \ that and we are going to take you with us,\u201D he smiled as he huffed and puffed\
  \ what locals in Chaouen called a \u2018chocolate\u2019.\n\nWe smiled at each other\
  \ and hopped onto Robbie\u2019s camper van.\n\nI could\u2019ve sworn that driving\
  \ through the mountains of Africa with my friends in a camper van is, most definitely,\
  \ a sight to behold and a memory to be cherished forever. Looking out the window\
  \ was pure magic because you get to see the mountain ranges with your own bare eyes.\
  \ It was breathtaking, to say the least.\n\nAs we arrived in Akchour, we hiked for\
  \ about 3 hours to see the waterfall. Jack immediately plunged into the freezing\
  \ cold water. Cira and Josh sat down and ate their salads, whilst Saniya roamed\
  \ around and meditated. I was hesitant if I was going to dip my feet in the water\
  \ but since we were already there, I took my shoes off and ran to the waterfall.\
  \ I stood there for about three minutes and I was pretty sure I was going to get\
  \ either hypothermia or pneumonia. I don\u2019t know how Jack did it. He was crazy.\
  \ But then again, we were all a bit crazy.\n\nWe drove back into Chefchaouen, but\
  \ we did stop to sit down at a local cafe to drink Moroccan tea. In that moment,\
  \ I finally realized what I was looking for. I wanted to belong somewhere, and to\
  \ somebody. In that moment, we all belonged together in that particular place.\n\
  \nAs I looked outside the window, the sun was slowly setting and the mountains slowly\
  \ vanishing. I never intended to look for heaven, but I realized this feeling was\
  \ heaven. This camper van was our safe haven. These people? They\u2019re my family.\n\
  \nIn the later years of my life, I figured that this moment will be considered one\
  \ of the best. These young travelers from all over the world sought refuge in the\
  \ mountains of Africa, and in each other, they found happiness, contentment, and\
  \ bliss. I will surely cherish this moment forever.\n\nEpilogue: Upon arriving back\
  \ at the hostel, Robbie let out a sigh of relief. We all asked what it was for and\
  \ he answered, \u201CMy van doesn\u2019t have any breaks so thank goodness we arrived\
  \ safely.\u201D"
