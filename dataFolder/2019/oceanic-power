Text: "I encountered my self wondering if New Zealand was my place in the world. Everything\
  \ happened so fast. I was there, living my dream. Twenty two years old and all of\
  \ a sudden I said goodbye to my parents, brothers, sister and friends. I put my\
  \ art career in pause, I was looking for a life changing adventure. Everything was\
  \ so safe and structured back home. I wanted freedom, I needed more. We were travelling\
  \ across the north island, enjoying the natural portraits. We had purchased a 1985\
  \ gorgeous Volvo which became our partner in this new path. My working holiday was\
  \ just beginning, we had found a small cozy house. I was going to find a job, anything\
  \ was worth the trouble, I had to survive without my parents financial help. I had\
  \ to grow up, finally. \nMy life back in Don Torcuato city was quite easy. I had\
  \ a loving family, lots of brothers and one sister. Since I can remember, there\
  \ was a person encharged of the cooking department and another one encharged of\
  \ the cleaning department. Our job was to wake up really early, go to school, do\
  \ our homework, have a bath and eat dinner. Television hours were pretty restricted,\
  \ we had special times to watch it, only after we finished with school obligations.\
  \ Already at university it was quite similar, we had to study. My mother wanted\
  \ us to focus on study but my father desired us to find a job so we could be independent\
  \ and help. The message was really confusing. We should work to pay our private\
  \ education after school, if not so we should go to a public University. The story\
  \ ends with my parents paying for three private institutions, just my brother Francisco\
  \ and later Agustin would study at the public University of Buenos Aires.  We were\
  \ a lazy bunch. I cant blame my father or my mother. They just wanted the best for\
  \ us, they invested a lot to give us the best education in Argentina, that\u2019\
  s why they decided to send us to \"Saint Andrews Scots School\" and further on,\
  \ they let us decide our career and the University. They thought knowledge and learning\
  \ english would open us the doors of our future. So much emphasis on academic education,\
  \ but little attention on what was happening inside our hearts. Everything was solved\
  \ by sending us to the corresponding specialist, clinical doctor, shrink, whatever.\
  \ We didn\u2019t deepen in conversations about our passions, beliefs or questions.\
  \ There were few moments to share. Life was happening, we were growing up. Our heads\
  \ were a mess and our inner self was trying to understand our purpose in life. My\
  \ father always stimulated us to travel, he would gladly sponsor any trip, if it\
  \ was in his economical possibilities. He wanted us to fly and get to know the world.\
  \  When I decided to apply for the visa to New Zealand and Australia he totally\
  \ agreed and helped me fulfill my project. That trip literally changed my life.\n\
  So here I was. Learning about life in the other corner of the map. I had to come\
  \ to this land to become a women. I left Ezeiza as a girl, who entirely depended\
  \ of her parents and support system to perform any action and I was growing to become\
  \ the person I really desired. Responsible, Independent, free and in love. I found\
  \ love, the greatest one. I immediately fell for a red-headed boy with green eyes\
  \ who had the world in his hand, and he showed me how to move, how to travel, how\
  \ to work, how to earn and the most important, how to love."
