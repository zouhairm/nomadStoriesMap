Text: "As I rustled around in the dark to turn off my alarm I heard her sigh. When\
  \ I dropped one of my running shoes as I headed out the door the sigh was louder.\
  \ Just 4 days into our two week once-in-a-lifetime-mother-daughter-vacation I was\
  \ questioning more than my decision to share this tiny hotel room. \n\nI had begged\
  \ Mom to let me book an inexpensive bed and breakfast but she insisted they were\
  \ horrible places. She had lived and worked in London for over 20 years and she\
  \ knew these things. Nothing was the same after 30 years I countered. While I was\
  \ in charge of planning she maintained her veto by insisting on paying for our accommodations.\n\
  \nOur itinerary was full of museums and flea markets - places we would both enjoy.\
  \ This was my first trip to London as an adult. I had resigned myself to missing\
  \ the nightlife but I was determined to see as much as possible. Tomorrow we would\
  \ leave to visit our relatives in Wales and there she could rest all she liked.\n\
  \nAfter a morning scouring the Portobello Market, we were off to see my birthplace.\
  \ I'd grown up being told I was a Cockney having been born \"within the sound of\
  \ Bow bells,\" the bells of the St Mary-le-Bow church. My parents had met at Hackney\
  \ Hospital. My father, a newly transplanted Colombian doctor struggling to learn\
  \ English, and my mother, a nurse almost twenty years into her career, had always\
  \ made an unlikely couple. \n\nMom was convinced there was no Underground stop in\
  \ Hackney and even after we got off at Homerton Station and turned onto the high\
  \ street she insisted nothing looked familiar. I pointed out a tall red and yellow\
  \ brick Victorian building about two blocks away which she claimed not to recognize.\
  \ Everything else she said looked too new. \n\nWe kept walking. When I gleefully\
  \ pointed to the bus stop marked Hackney Hospital she was finally convinced. She\
  \ scrutinized the buildings stopping in front of Major Surgery where she used to\
  \ work then the Nurses Residence, the \"dorm\" she had lived in for so many years.\
  \ Up close the tall brick building, the original part of the complex, was wrapped\
  \ in chain link fencing with saplings growing from its eaves. \n\n\"So which one\
  \ was I was born in?\"\n\nMom looked at me strangely, \"You weren't born at Hackney.\
  \ You were born in Walthamstow.\" \n\n\"What?\" I snapped. \"What hospital, what\
  \ was it called?\"\n\n\"I don't remember.\" I pressed. She vacillated. A huge sigh.\
  \ \"Walthamstow Maternity. I think.\"\n\nA security guard poked out from his trailer.\
  \ \"Ladies, may I help you?\" There was no Walthamstow Maternity on his map. \"\
  We've got Whipps Cross Maternity, about a half hour out if you take the W15, or\
  \ Thorpe Combe further north.\" I thanked him and looked questioningly at Mom. \n\
  \n\"I don't remember!\" \n\nI bit my lip and we continued walking. \"The Adam and\
  \ Eve!\" she said suddenly and started smiling. Across the street I saw the pub's\
  \ white terracotta facade, complete with Adam and Eve in life size relief. I decided\
  \ we could both use a happy hour.\n\nShe walked into the bar looking around like\
  \ it was another museum. It was their old haunt. We took our pints to a table and\
  \ the stories started to pour out. Dances and parties, a highborn but homely boyfriend.\
  \ All good times at first. Then she told me how the English doctors made fun of\
  \ my father's accent, his request for plaster boats instead of boots. As we finished\
  \ up the second round I asked the question that had always sat just below the surface\
  \ of our superficial conversations. \"Is that why you married him? Because you felt\
  \ sorry for him?\"\n\nGathering her strength she looked me in the eye, \"We got\
  \ married because we had to. You were a tiny baby but you weren't premature.\" Family\
  \ photos flipped through my mind settling on my mother in her grey brocade wedding\
  \ dress. She got up to find the loo. Realizing it was almost dusk, I decided we\
  \ would take a taxi back to the hotel. I'd pay. We had covered enough ground for\
  \ one day."
