Text: "Sequestered between the past memory of my own journey and the open view of\
  \ crooked trees and dancing birds I crouch down and touch the earth.\n\nI am somewhere\
  \ in Germany. Surrounded by trees and a perfect trail leads me through their embrace.\
  \ In the moment of touching the sacred ground, taking a breath to remember a beautiful\
  \ women appears at my side.\n\nI remwber her face. Her cheeks , her soft eyes, her\
  \ posture, solid like a local tree her. She was bright Like the sun and in her light\
  \ I stood and said hello.\nI was looking for a local government building, stranded\
  \ without a passport and paradoxicaly serene in my surroundings. We said hello and\
  \ began our walk through those woods together. Like old friends catching up, we\
  \ discussed. The length and. Breadth of the universe like experts on television.\
  \ Though here there was no television only the sound of wind in the trees and the\
  \ great shards of light sinking through the gaps in the trees. \n\nI forget her\
  \ name , If only I knew. Maybe some day she will find this in the vast expanse of\
  \ the infinite unknown of the universe and we can find ourselves engaged once more\
  \ in the temporary interactions we use this space for. Maybe.\n\nOr perhaps I will\
  \ explore another forest somewhere and come across another moment of equal perfection.\
  \ Maybe."
