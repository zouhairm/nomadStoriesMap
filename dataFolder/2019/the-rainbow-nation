Text: One day my father paid for me to take a trip to Durban. This was my first time
  traveling to a place where there was a beach. My first day there really surprised
  me, with the apartheid in South Africa still among the people, it shocked me to
  see the unity at the Durban south beach. The place was filled with blacks, whites,
  indians and other races. There was love, joy and happiness flowing around the area.
  Smiles on the children's faces, adults having drinks and food together. This was
  when I saw what our late great leader Nelson Mandela saw, a united nation, a rainbow
  nation. It is with great pleasure and honour to say I've experienced what I thought
  I'd never see ever in my life. I never expected to find people on such a united
  front. Day by day my beloved country is getting better and peace shall reign. No
  one in the world would have ever convinced me that racism would be a thing of the
  past in this beautiful country. Durban has the best curries, best bunny chows(kotas),
  best krable pap(uphuthu or best known as cous cous). The are lots to see like the
  biggest mall in South Africa the Gateway Mall, Ushaka Marine world for entertainment
  and beautiful beaches and other wonderful sites ti see.
