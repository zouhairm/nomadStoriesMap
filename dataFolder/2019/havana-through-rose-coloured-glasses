Text: "My host had arranged for her daughter to drop me at the airport. It worked\
  \ out for both of us as I received door-to-door service, and it gave her daughter\
  \ some cash. I\u2019d enjoyed this aspect of Cuban society, the camaraderie of the\
  \ people to spread the wealth. Communism, in its simplest form. \n\nWalking down\
  \ the cracked cement stairs of her mum\u2019s apartment block I saw her standing\
  \ by the side of the car, bronzed skin dewy in the persistent humidity, dark hair\
  \ shining in the reflection of the sun. You couldn\u2019t escape the sun in Cuba,\
  \ the faded pastel colours of the buildings a testament to a lifetime spent in it.\
  \ With a genuine smile she introduced herself as Maria. Standing next to her was\
  \ a man with the same golden skin, who went by Manie. He turned out to be the boyfriend\
  \ and our designated driver. \n\nManie lifted my lumpy backpack into the boot of\
  \ his 70s Soviet sedan, the paint work gleaming. That\u2019s the funny thing about\
  \ cars in Cuba, a lot of pride seemed to go into the exteriors, whilst anything\
  \ could reside under the bonnet, even the power-plant of a retired lawnmower.  \n\
  \nWe drove out along the Malecon, the Atlantic Ocean licking at the seawall formed\
  \ around the city. I held my head out the window, trying to get a hint of  the cooler\
  \ breeze off the water. \n\u2018Did you enjoy your time in Cuba?\u2019 Maria asked\
  \ as I watched a man sitting cross-legged on top of the wall, picking at the strings\
  \ of his guitar in rhythmic ecstasy, his eyes closed as if to block out any other\
  \ sensory interruption. \n\u2018I loved it\u2019 I said with a gushy grin. \n\n\
  Maria and I fell into easy chatter. She spoke fluent English, Spanish and French,\
  \ had a degree in marketing, and in her spare time volunteered at a charity. At\
  \ 30 years old, she was more accomplished than most people I knew back home. \n\u2018\
  Where are you off to next?\u2019 Maria asked. \n\u2018Just to America for a few\
  \ nights then home. To Australia'.\n\u2018 I would love to go to Australia\u2019\
  \ Maria replied, pronouncing it Our-stralia with her Cuban accent.\n\u2018You should\
  \ one day\u2019. \nAs we drove out of the city a pale pink and white 50s classic\
  \ car beeped enthusiastically, its owner waving at Manie, a smile as wide as the\
  \ Panama Canal plastered on his face. \n\n\u2018I wanted to go to France,\u2019\
  \ Maria said after a beat of silence, \u2018but I got denied\u2019.\n\u2018What\
  \ do you mean?\u2019 I replied, glancing at her side profile, at this queen of a\
  \ woman. \n\u2018My sister and I applied to go to France for a few months. We organised\
  \ a letter from a host family in France, bought passports and put in our application\
  \ but it got denied by the Cuban government. Wasted all that money applying\u2019\
  . \n\u2018But why did they deny it?\u2019 \n\u2018I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like\
  \ they want you to think you have freedom but really you don\u2019t\u2019.\nOutside\
  \ clusters of palm trees sprouted out from unkempt bushes, reminding me I was still\
  \ on an island. To me, those trees represented beach chairs and pina coladas, but\
  \ at that moment I could see them through Maria\u2019s eyes: a sign of endless summers\
  \ and isolation. \n\n\u2018Will you keep trying?\u2019 I asked.\n\u2018I\u2019m\
  \ not sure. It\u2019s so heartbreaking when it falls through\u2019. \nI didn\u2019\
  t know what to say. I felt guilty for my own freedom of mobility, something I completely\
  \ took for granted because I had never known any different. At that point the rose-coloured\
  \ glasses slipped from my nose, and despite my idealism about the strong sense of\
  \ community Communism fostered, I now understood I had only seen their society through\
  \ a tourist\u2019s perspective. I was merely a visitor to the island.\n\nAt the\
  \ departures bay I stood on the curb, giving one last wave to my newfound amigos,\
  \ and was hit with the overwhelming irony of the situation: although dropping off\
  \ many of her mum\u2019s guests to this very airport, Maria might never have actually\
  \ been inside."
