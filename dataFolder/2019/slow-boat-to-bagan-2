Text: "Next morning we set off very early for the \u201Cslow boat\u201D from Mandalay\
  \ to Bagan up the Irrawaddy river.\nThe hotel packed us a picnic breakfast, taxi\
  \ arrived at 6am SHARP and we set off for the pier in the darkness.\nIn the still\
  \ twilight the monks were out in the numbers.  Walking with their bowl and silver\
  \ offering dish to begin their day.\nStray dogs littered the street an occasion\
  \ pig and roosters wandered here and there plucking up the remains of the previous\
  \ night.\nOnly a few tourists with early departures were buzzing by in tuk tuks\
  \ on the way to the airport, bus station or pier.  I love the early mornings!\n\
  We arrived at the pier with the giant full pink moon over the river and the purple\
  \ sky of the new days sunrise.  It was all a buzz with activity loading the boats\
  \ for a days work.   Barges carrying cargo of rice, old tires, gravel, grains etc\
  \ were setting off for other lands.  The shoreline was filled with women doing the\
  \ days laundry, old worn out fishing gear and dusty children played on the seawalls.\n\
  Our ferry boats were all lined up.  We passed through the fancy one we had reserved\
  \ to a smaller boat..all the same price..no one mentioned the itinerary change it\
  \ was just the way it was.\nWe, a bunch of traveling strangers in bamboo lounge\
  \ chairs put together for the next adventure.\nFrom around the world people came\
  \ to experience this new frontier.  I think we were the only Americans on the barge.\
  \  We all squeezed on the top deck together to capture photos of shiny temples on\
  \ the hillsides, the river people in tiny bamboo huts, the sunrise and fishermen.\n\
  We chose our seats on the back deck.  My son soon fell asleep..(he is always sleeping)\
  \ and I made my way up to the high deck.  I met some french women traveling together.\
  \  As I laid on the bench, next to them, they began to sing songs from a collection\
  \ of lost famous french singers.  \nWe were served lunch, I had a warm beer and\
  \ life was absolutely PERFECT!!!\nOur boat stopped a few times, it seemed to have\
  \ overheated, or something?  \nYou never know what is happening since the Burmese\
  \ always have a warming smile that will diffuse any situation!.  \nWe passed a barge\
  \ carrying coal that seemed to run a ground and several tugboats were working tirelessly\
  \ to pry them upstream.  \nThis is the way of a nomad traveler.  You prepare for\
  \ delays but in those moments you find moments of complete bliss!"
