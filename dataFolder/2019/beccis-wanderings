Text: "She never went on a trip that far away. All on her own. \nExcitement. The feeling\
  \ that affected her the most. Still there was a slight appearance of fear. \nA few\
  \ days before she was supposed to go on the best trip of her life she packed her\
  \ backpack. \"Do I really need that?\" A question every backpacker should ask themself.\
  \ Every little piece that finds it\xB4s way in a backpack should be important. Should\
  \ be nessesary. Otherwise it\xB4s just a load you don\xB4t need.\nAs soon as everything\
  \ was packed she felt so relieved. Relieved and ready.\nThe day came. She took her\
  \ backpack and her camera bag. Only once she looked back as she sat in the car,\
  \ that brought her to the airport and to the start of her biggest adventure.\nThe\
  \ check-in felt like forever. Finally she sat down in the plane. Now the fear took\
  \ the main place in her head. \"Why am I doing this?\" \"Do I really want to do\
  \ this?\" \" Am I able to do this all on my own?\" All these questions were floating\
  \ around in her mind. She tried to mute them. \nAs the plane picked off her head\
  \ was empty. No more questions. No more irritating thoughts.\nShe layed back, put\
  \ her headphones in, turned the music up and closed her eyes. \nThe first stop was\
  \ Doha. Unfortunatly it was late, so she couldn\xB4t see anything but the airport.\
  \ \nBack in the air. Just a few more hours and she\xB4s going to be in Australia.\
  \ The country of her dreams. The country where she always wanted to go. \nShe still\
  \ couldn\xB4t believe it. \n14 hours later the plane landed in Sydney. The city\
  \ of dreams. \nPretty fast she found her hostel and made some friends at the same\
  \ night. \nThe next day she went for a city trip. The first time she stood infront\
  \ of the Opera house was like a dream. Unreal but so amazing.\nThat was the point\
  \ she started to realise that she was on the other side of the world.\nThousands\
  \ of kilometers away from home. No Family or friends who would offer a safe environment.\n\
  Suddenly she felt so strong. As strong as she never felt before. She was on her\
  \ own. All on her own.\nNo adults telling her what to do or where to go. \nHer adventure\
  \ was about to start. \nIn the same night she decided that this should take place\
  \ on Tasmania. A little island south of the mainland of Australia. \nShe booked\
  \ a bus, a flight and a hostel. On social media she found a girl with the same plans.\
  \ \nTogether they rented a van and started their roadtrip around the island.\nAs\
  \ soon as she saw the first sunset on the road, she was in love.\nIn love with the\
  \ life on the road. The freedom it gives to you when you live in a mobile home and\
  \ are able to decide where you want to sleep every night but always have your home\
  \ with you. \nThe leap into the unknown was a complete success. She was so happy\
  \ she dared to go on that trip. The adventure that was going to change her whole\
  \ life.\nShe was grateful and nervous but so excited to have a whole year of new\
  \ experiences infront of her."
