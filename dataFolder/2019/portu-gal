Text: "It been less than a week since I\u2019ve came back from a spontaneous trip\
  \ with my friend to Portugal. We treated ourselves for our College Graduation and\
  \ this was the first time I traveled alone without it being for school. I\u2019\
  ve traveled to Germany, Paris & Amsterdam for my Study Abroad Program in 2017. You\
  \ can say that Europe has played a special part in my travel diary. \nI didn\u2019\
  t know what to expect from all places I traveled to. However, Portugal caught me\
  \ by the biggest surprise. I was grateful for the elevator in my Brooklyn apartment\
  \ not working the two weeks before I departed because those stairs to the last floor\
  \ helped me overcome all of the hills I came across in Lisbon and especially Porto!\
  \ But nothing beats the beautiful tiles I saw adhered to almost every building across\
  \ the cities. \nThe two weeks I spent in Portugal were breathtaking and going there\
  \ not knowing a single word of Portuguese was truly a leap into the unknown. But\
  \ the outcome was spectacular because I got to learn things no class in college\
  \ could teach (besides my architecture courses, of course). We thought two weeks\
  \ were enough to see everything we needed and a little more, which was not entirely\
  \ true. \nWe did get to see a tremendous amount of sites and tried the diverse quantities\
  \ of cuisine they had to offer. But we were so caught up into getting to each spot\
  \ on time in order to catch the sunset at the highest \u201CMiradouro\u201D of the\
  \ area we were exploring. We did not really get into much conversations with many\
  \ locals because of the language barrier but that did not really interfere too much\
  \ because many of them spoke a fair amount of English. However, it would have been\
  \ 10x better to connect on a level other than that. Traveling to another country\
  \ and not knowing the language can be very intimidating but some of the people of\
  \ Portugal were so genuine and directed us to some great spots that many tourists\
  \ go see and they were quite lovely. But now that I\u2019m thinking back, I wonder\
  \ where they could have lead us if we were Portuguese speaking travelers. A hole\
  \ in the wall restaurant that\u2019s got some of the best tasting Portuguese food?\
  \ A hidden Miradouro? Maybe even tell us what to do when it comes to the nightlife\
  \ because it seemed completely different from what we were used to in New York.\
  \ I would have loved to let loose and set free in the Portugese nightlife but the\
  \ experience I had was a little awkward. \nNow that I know a little more of the\
  \ language than just to get around, a second chance at traveling to Portugal would\
  \ be a completely different approach. I wouldn\u2019t even mind going up to some\
  \ locals and just starting a conversation with them to learn about some of their\
  \ favorite spots or even get their views about New York."
