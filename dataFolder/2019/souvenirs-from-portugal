Text: "You say you want to travel the world\nbut there are some places you cannot\
  \ go even if you travel there.\n\nHere I am, nestled in the small village of Tojal,\n\
  \nwondering what I can bring you; a piece of somewhere you\u2019ve not yet been.\n\
  \nIf I could, I\u2019d bring you the taste\nof one of my late-grandfather\u2019\
  s sun-warmed oranges just picked,\nor the subtle scent of pine and eucalyptus that\
  \ permeates the hot air, or a bite of fresh bread from the baker down the road that\
  \ appears as if by magic on our door handle every morning, or the sound of roosters\
  \ singing not just in the morning but whenever they so please. \n\nI\u2019d bring\
  \ you the juice of my uncle\u2019s sweet peaches dripping down your fingers.\n\n\
  I\u2019d give you the feeling of rough bark under your feet to reach the ripest\
  \ figs in the tree behind the house as you look down at stalls that used to hold\
  \ chickens but now hold only memories of clucking\n\nI\u2019d give you thirst from\
  \ the hot sun on your head as you walk dusty paths through vineyards until you finally\
  \ reach the spring and cup your hands under the small stream and sip the water cool\
  \ and clear as the day my grandfather first discovered it.\n\n*    *    *    * \
  \   *    *    *\n\nThen I\u2019d take you down the roads and hills to Batalha and\
  \ give you the sounds of gypsies shouting prices in the market, the taste of fresh\
  \ goat cheese cool and soft, vibrant colours of scarves thimbles wooden spoons fish\
  \ beach towels baby chicks plums lettuce more fish leather shoes cheese walnuts\
  \ rabbits pears...\n\nand the sight of the Mosteiro\ntowering\nfull of history\n\
  echoes of \nkings    and queens      and battles\n\nI\u2019d give you the sound\
  \ of your footsteps against smooth stone\nI\u2019d give you\nthe eerie feeling of\
  \ walking amidst the past and the present at the same time\n\nAnd then, Nazar\xE9\
  ! \n\nWould that I could bring you the feeling of wildness\nfrigid waves crashing\
  \ against your entire body\n\nI\u2019d lend you\nmy stirred soul\nfor just a minute\n\
  if there was a way to give you         memories of myself as a child being tumbled\n\
  \          a small bundle of limbs salt water rough sand\n\nbut no fear.\n\nI\u2019\
  d give you salt-coated fingers from thick pumpkin seeds eaten while seated on grainy\
  \ sand\nI\u2019d give you salt-sprayed hair I\u2019d give you salt-coated fish I\u2019\
  d give you salt-covered skin from white foam\n\nI\u2019d bring you\nthe crash of\
  \ ocean echoing against cliffs\n\nI\u2019d give you\nfor a second,\nthe beating\
  \ of my heart in perfect rhythm with these waves\nand the ache of leaving them.\n\
  \nThere\u2019s no novelty mug\nthat could capture the feeling of watching my mother\
  \ sift through\nold boxes stuffed with letters in her own handwriting\naddressed\
  \ to people no longer here\n\nno postcard I could send that would give you\nthe\
  \ sense of saudade\nthat seeps from\n       the little windmill that no longer spins\n\
  \       the fields of corn and grapes and olive trees now covered in weeds\n   \
  \    the attic full of broken furniture with locked drawers of old black and white\
  \ photos\n       the missing love letters from my grandfather that my grandmother\
  \ burned after he died                    \n                                   \
  \            \nno keychain I could bring you\nthat would tell you what it\u2019\
  s like to be a child of people that left this all behind but still search for a\
  \ place that no longer exists and hold it in their hearts and tell stories of the\
  \ way it used to be, freedom and poverty and hard work and forever roaming and stealing\
  \ fruit and and drinking homemade wine and friends and family long passed away and\
  \ hunger and meeting companions in the fields and making their fun out of sticks\
  \ and grass and imagination and then growing up and longing for escape and a bigger\
  \ world and taking a plane across an ocean to make a life somewhere else and have\
  \ children in another land who would never really\n\nbelong here\n\nand yet somehow\
  \ still\nbelong here.\n\nSaudade is a birthright. Inherited.\n\nThere\u2019s no\
  \ souvenir I could bring you\nof a decades-lost Portugal\nfor there are some places\
  \ you cannot go even if you travel there."
