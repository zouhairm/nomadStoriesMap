Text: "It was in 2006 and when I was just seven years old. When I travel in a country\
  \ call Congo Democratic Rep with my parents and my little brother whom we still\
  \ live with until now, and that was my second time to travel and while my first\
  \ travel was in a country call Burundi when I was just 5 years old going to attend\
  \ a wedding of my cousin.\n\n My journey going to Congo Democratic Rep was full\
  \ with a lot of suppressed while a lot of people using to travel in that country\
  \ the use ships and boats with 89% rate while I landed in that country I couldn\u2019\
  t believe what the tald me going where we were in that city it required airplanes\
  \ or ship which until now when im telling people about that the can\u2019t believe\
  \ it.\n\nAfter I was 10 years old I travel in Rwanda where I just saw someone get\
  \ arrested of spitting and someone peels banana and throw a skin down I was so amused\
  \ seeing what happened in front of my eyes where I got a mind of controlling my\
  \ bad behaviours which teached me not al place are the same though the all in one\
  \ continent\n\nWhen I reached the age of teenagers when I got a lot of funny on\
  \ traveling even which made me to be a YouTube creater and being in a lot of social\
  \ media sharing my traveling moments with friends when I started regretting the\
  \ early age of my traveling I could started Doing this if now maybe I could be a\
  \ good contributor and a good model \n\nThen I just travel when I was 17 years old\
  \ in country call Tanzania where I had a lot of funny not like just before where\
  \ I could do much funny because of my age which made me more happier Tanzania kids\
  \ really like playing sports each day every evening and every weekends morning and\
  \ evening which made me happy as Sports are the part of my enjoyable moments it\u2019\
  s where I played soccer for three weeks and I felt like I\u2019m more than Messi\
  \ and Ronald I shoot or recorded each steps I took in that country but something\
  \ was those days in Africa it was only those phones of buttons and hutch the require\
  \ memory cards in order to record anything I did all I can to record each moments\
  \ but what I got lastly it\u2019s got my memory card erasing all thins that I have\
  \ been wasted my time to record \n\nThat\u2019s a moment I never felt in all my\
  \ trip of traveling where there was a point I spent all my journey in the airplane\
  \ just sleeping entire time of traveling."
