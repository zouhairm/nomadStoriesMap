Text: "The Strada Statale 163, also known as the Amalfi Drive, is a curving highway\
  \ nestled in the cliffs of Positano\u2019s coastline, overlooking the sparkling\
  \ Tyrrhennian Sea. Rounding each bend brings a simultaneous rush of awe and fear\u2026\
  \ The water - the most beautiful you\u2019ve ever seen. The road - potentially the\
  \ most dangerous you\u2019ve traversed. Every second car beeps as they round the\
  \ corner like they\u2019ve just discovered their car horn. A bit aggressive, I think\u2026\
  \ but in Italy, a beep says nothing more than \u201CI\u2019m coming around the bend\u2026\
  \ move!\u201D\n\nI know what we see of Positano when we scroll through Instagram\
  \ circa July is the colourful townscape embedded into the mountains, but hear me\
  \ when I say, the greatest thing to do in Positano is breathe. If you\u2019re lucky\
  \ enough to visit in the spring or summer months, jasmine lingers in the air like\
  \ Nonna\u2019s heavy perfume, and every building and balustrade is decorated with\
  \ nature\u2019s own jewellery - hibiscus flowers and bougainvillea in vivid pinks,\
  \ purples and oranges.\n\nOne of the most magical nights of my life was when I woke\
  \ up at 4am, overheating. I opened the window (I don\u2019t think Positano does\
  \ the whole fly screen thing, by the way), and was met with the scent of jasmine,\
  \ carried on the warm air by a crisp breeze. It felt like little icicles on my skin\u2026\
  \ and the ocean was pitch black, with only a thin pathway of ripples lit by the\
  \ moon.\n\nI honestly can\u2019t remember if the moon was full, I was too busy trying\
  \ to remember the smell of the air, forever. But let\u2019s be real, it was probably\
  \ full. I felt like the only person in the world on that night\u2026 (even though\
  \ my sister was snoring in the same room).\n\nI don\u2019t know if it was just me,\
  \ but waking up and walking out onto the terrace of a Villa di Positano is otherworldly.\
  \ It\u2019s like there\u2019s a permanent filter washed over the world. The sun\
  \ feels softer and a tad more orange. It\u2019s warmer on the skin, too. I mean\
  \ it wholeheartedly when I say, there\u2019s no greater heaven on earth than waking\
  \ up to the ocean, and a lazy breakfast of espresso, prosciutto crudo and mozzarella\
  \ on pane, and if you\u2019re lucky, a lover by your side.\n\n\u2026I went with\
  \ a bustling family of seven, so it was a little less romantic and a little more\
  \ \u201Cpass the cheese!\u201D, but you get the picture.\n\nPositano is the true\
  \ epitome of what you do when life gives you lemons\u2026 you make lemon gelato,\
  \ lemon pasta, lemon granita, and of course, the limoncello spritz. Positano grows\
  \ the sweetest lemons in the world for its visitors, and has built a vibrant tourist\
  \ destination around the humble lemon.\n\nAnd if you think tourism may take away\
  \ from an authentic experience, the rows of tomatoes growing under the shade of\
  \ grapevines in local backyards beg to differ. Lesser known, is that Positano grows\
  \ some of the sweetest tomatoes.\n\nI owe you a limoncello spritz if you disagree\u2026\
  \ the best caprese you\u2019ll ever eat will be from Positano. With locally grown\
  \ tomatoes and Fiori di Latte cheese sourced from the nearby town of Agerola, it\u2019\
  s as fresh as it gets. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I\u2019ve always said there\u2019\
  s extra magic in Positano\u2019s food.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to sound all mystical,\
  \ but the best caprese in Positano is on top of a flight of (what felt like) 3000\
  \ stairs, in a little cafe called Il Chiosco Del Sentiero Degli Dei, which translates\
  \ to The Cafe of The Path of the Gods. The tomatoes are grown by locals in the mountain,\
  \ and are transported every day by goats. In a true show of Italy\u2019s laid-back\
  \ vibe, working dogs are trained to lead the goats. If you don\u2019t want to eat\
  \ fresh mountain tomatoes carried upstairs by a dog-led goat, then I\u2019m sorry,\
  \ but nothing in this world will impress you!\n\nI\u2019d love to go back, but it\
  \ would be dangerous, because next time I find myself in Positano, I\u2019m going\
  \ to tie myself to one of those beach chairs in everyone\u2019s Instagram photos\
  \ and never come home!"
