Text: "The more I think about it, the less I understand why it took so long to came\
  \ to this conclusion. I mean, it's like waiting for a sad tea and then realizing\
  \ you just want a double coffee. A waste of time, somehow.\n\nI've always looked\
  \ up to travellers: like some kind of anthropologists, they go through countries\
  \ and cultures, land on habits and places never seen before and start living like\
  \ the first time they set foot in this world. It's not just a matter of knowledge\
  \ and skills, it's something that has to do with someone's ability to be astonished\
  \ by humanity.\n\nStill, it's not the distance we covered but the experience we\
  \ shared that matter.\n\nLast summer I went to Cupramontana, a Roman town in the\
  \ Marche region. I spent there one week, working as a volunteer for Libera contro\
  \ le Mafie, an Italian association whose aim is to put an end to organized crime\
  \ both in Italy and in South America.\n\nThose few days, under the heat of a warm\
  \ and melancholic sun, traced a deep line. I know it might sound exaggerated (at\
  \ first, I had this thought too) but thanks to Cupramontana I resized myself. I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect to find such a young community filled with passion, civil responsibility\
  \ and expectation for a future we, still, can draw. Francesco and his political\
  \ commitment, Eleonora's feminist battle and her generous sensitivity, Giacomo\u2019\
  s recorded history and Filippo, whose social engagement reminds me of a kind of\
  \ authenticity that marks out only youth. Their rare humanity gave me hope.\n\n\
  When, the 15th July 2018, I got off the 2:35 pm train at Jesi I was aware only of\
  \ myself, of how being socially awkward affected me and my interests. After a week,\
  \ my perspective changed a lot: I was still myself, always fighting with insecurity\
  \ and a sense of being unfit, but I decided that those emotions would have not affected\
  \ me as much as they did before.\n\nEvery morning, I worked on a vegetable garden\
  \ owned by a rehab center where people of different ages and diverse grades of drug\
  \ dependency or of psychiatric disorders, spend their summer. I had to handle fears\
  \ and prejudices and it was not that easy at the time, but I got the chance to meet\
  \ people, bruised with pain and self-harm, that welcomed me with open arms. They\
  \ fed me, they made me smile, they gave me time and consideration. We were a family.\n\
  In the afternoons, we saw movies or read documents on criminal organizations, civil\
  \ responsibility and global cooperation. With those tools and facts we spent a few\
  \ hours debating \u2018till the evening when we usually went to the city centre\
  \ to meet associations or political movements, such as SPI CGIL and Jesi Anarchists.\n\
  \nDuring those seven days, I pushed myself over fears and anxieties and learnt that\
  \ being socially engaged is an everyday task. As Aristotle said \u201Cman is by\
  \ nature a social animal\u201D, which means not only that our personal identity\
  \ is the result of an endless process of confrontation with others, but also that\
  \ we are meant to live together.\n\nNowadays, Capitalism has effects not only in\
  \ the marketplace but also in our social relationships: everything has a price and\
  \ money is not just a tool but a primary necessity. People or process that cannot\
  \ be reduced to this equation are considered dangerous as their sole existence would\
  \ turn this status of power upside down. Feminist Movements, LGBTQ+ Communities,\
  \ Immigrants\u2019 Rights Movements, Libera and many other associations against\
  \ corruption, are all expressions of a society that is not represented by violence,\
  \ dishonesty, prejudice and racism.\n\nAt Cupramontana I learnt that disillusion\
  \ and resignation will never lead to any progress but culture can make a difference.\n\
  \nCome gather 'round people / Wherever you roam / And admit that the waters / Around\
  \ you have grown / And accept it that soon / You'll be drenched to the bone. / If\
  \ your time to you / Is worth savin' / Then you better start swimmin' / Or you'll\
  \ sink like a stone / For the times they are a-changin'.\n\nBob Dylan, Times They\
  \ Are A-Changing"
