Text: "My ears still ring to this day from the roar of the Neretva River. Perched\
  \ on boulders beneath the Stari Most Bridge, my friend Neea and I were thrilled\
  \ and utterly paralyzed at the sight of the churning, aqua-blue currents rushing\
  \ below. Hundreds of feet above us, dangling their tanned bodies over the walls\
  \ of the stone walkway, competitive divers took turns leaping from the bridge and\
  \ nearly crashing onto our heads. Locals sleepily mulled through the trinket-filled\
  \ markets dotting the main road as others came and went to and from the old Turkish\
  \ houses perched at the cliff\u2019s edge. Black and white marbled cats darted across\
  \ shingled rooftops, chasing one another playfully. With a soft breeze breaking\
  \ the early summer air, shop curtains and colorful glass lamps swayed in the open\
  \ windows across the river. The lull of it all was absolutely breathtaking, like\
  \ a perfectly orchestrated scene from another era. I was painful to remind ourselves\
  \ once more of the recent war history that had torn at such a now-quiet place. We\
  \ couldn\u2019t stop asking each other, \u201CHow on earth did we get here?\u201D\
  \nEarlier that morning, we had eagerly climbed into a car leaving from Split, Croatia\
  \ and drove deep into the southern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina. One blonde from\
  \ Finland and one tall Californian\u2014 we looked to be quite the odd pair of travelers\
  \ and the Bosnian border police were completely bewildered as to how we had ended\
  \ up at their gate. We waited for an hour in the no-man\u2019s land between countries,\
  \ patiently waiting to re-obtain our passports from the most stoic officers we had\
  \ met yet throughout our months of travels. Luckily for us, we had brought along\
  \ the enormous (face-sized!) avocados, gargantuan apples, and fresh bread purchased\
  \ earlier that morning from our favorite street vendor in Split. I almost laughed\
  \ aloud despite the situation from thinking about the concerned grandmother at her\
  \ food stand who, only a few hours ago, scolded Neea and I for not bringing enough\
  \ food for the road and lovingly sent us off with more than we asked for. While\
  \ we waited in international purgatory, we had the most delightful yet wonderfully\
  \ anxiety-ridden picnic of our lives right there at the border. Finally, with curious\
  \ minds, research done, and passports in hand, we finally made it through to Bosnia\
  \ and Herzegovina and ultimately to the UNESCO World Heritage site that is Stari\
  \ Most.\n\tCompared to sitting there amidst the water at the town center, there\
  \ is no place on earth where I have ever felt further from home and in love with\
  \ every second of it. There is no recipe to me that exists for a \u201Cperfect vacation\u201D\
  \ or \u201Ctrip of a lifetime\u201D\u2014instead, the best adventure comes in launching\
  \ yourself into situations and cultures you have more to learn from. Every moment,\
  \ in its rawness and purest capacity, offers far more growth than you may even realize\
  \ is occurring."
