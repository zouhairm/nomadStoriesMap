Text: "My brother and I just left behind both difficult love stories. We sort of needed\
  \ to take some fresh new air...\nwe found at Budapest, one week later.\n\nKind of\
  \ a normal story, both brother and sister needing to change our minds. Visiting\
  \ the city center, Synagogues, local food market, outdoor baths. Our week was almost\
  \ over when we ended up, after eating at a restaurant, at the \"Szimpla Kert\".\
  \ Local curiosity located in the center of the Jewish neighborhood, it was 11 p.m.\
  \ when we took our chance and entered. Kerts are huge sheds redeveloped in nightclubs,\
  \ bars and rooms when absolutely A-NY-THING can happen.\n\nAnd it happened.\nIridescent\
  \ redlights, warm temperature and moist atmosphere in all rooms. My brother and\
  \ I thought we just found some brothel we must run away from. A beer in each hand,\
  \ our hazardous steps led us in a big room where it was allowed to smoke hooka and\
  \ other substances impossible to mention due to censorship. Immense sofas were arranged\
  \ next to armchairs of different shapes and sizes and colors, still in this strange\
  \ redlight transforming anyone in a purple zombie. Even the most beautiful girl/boy\
  \ in there could have looked like Frankenstein. When buying hookah tobacco, the\
  \ saleswoman explained that after smoking, there is a unicorn in the room, but most\
  \ people only found it once out of this place. We burst out laughing my brother\
  \ and me. \nOkay. \nA hidden unicorn, very well,.\nSo we assume that there are substances\
  \ other than hookah tobacco even in the simplest of them. Bought it anyway. This\
  \ was the last evening of a sort of amorous pilgrimage for both of us, just to cut\
  \ with all that was going on in our personal lives, so we weren't going to let down\
  \ ! After two hours sitting on a strange sofa, three hookas and dozen of beers,\
  \ we ended up discussing with other people in the room, looking for the unicorn\
  \ too. \n\nPast midnight, we started with our new funny friends looking for the\
  \ unicorn : on the numerous drawings hanging on the walls, tags on the ceilings,\
  \ and even under the chairs on which we were. When the saleswoman warned us that\
  \ they havee to close in ten minutes, we had to face the facts: the unicorn could\
  \ not be found. Szimpla kert was closing, and once out we had to admit that the\
  \ hidden unicorn would remain so. \n\nWe talked about it the next morning packing\
  \ our bags, on the way back and even back home. \n\nThe saleswoman was right.\n\
  We found the unicorn only a few weeks later. On the photographs that we had obviously\
  \ taken that night ... \n\nWe were sitting on it all the evening."
