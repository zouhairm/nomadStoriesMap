Text: "My passport has expired and it\u2019s been nearly ten years since I stood in\
  \ an immigration line waiting to be processed, waiting with anticipation. That first\
  \ moment of air taken in outside the airport was always exhilarating. I had expected\
  \ that I would become a world traveler. Hopes of becoming a journalist on assignment\
  \ for renowned publications in the likes of National Geographic filled my young\
  \ mind. \n\nYet, I sit sunken back in my chair as I hear the news that my newly-adult\
  \ niece is making plans for her first international trip. I can hardly believe she\
  \ is an adult now let alone traveling abroad. She is only a couple years older than\
  \ I was the first time I put a passport to use. The feelings of delight for what\
  \ awaits her simultaneously prompt my own feelings of what I had thought I would\
  \ become, but never did. Those thoughts sat there in the chair with me, heavy and\
  \ sunken.\n\nThe question \u201Cwhen was the last time my feet walked on foreign\
  \ soil?\u201D Realizing that it had been that long and now arriving at what that\
  \ meant to me. Some might question themselves, \u201Cwhat happened to me? What have\
  \ I been doing? Why haven\u2019t I traveled this past decade?\u201D \n\nHowever,\
  \ the reasons for me were always clear. Instead it was a wondering if I still wanted\
  \ to be & do what I once had. That answer had been muddied by life circumstances.\
  \ So, I simply asked one question: \u201CDo I want to travel again?\u201D Then two:\
  \ \u201CWhere do I want to go?\u201D Then three: \u201CHow can I make this happen?\u201D\
  \n\nSix months went by, those same three questions pop up while standing in the\
  \ airport terminal. They repeat in sequence as the line to the left of me moves\
  \ by. At this point I\u2019ve made that first trip in ten years, I experienced it,\
  \ I felt it, I adventured, and now I am going home.\n\nIn my youth I had felt \u201C\
  The story\u201D was outside, it was other people in other places. The soul and depth\
  \ of my writing couldn\u2019t possibly be in my personal journals. Those words were\
  \ for my own catharsis.\n\nI'm walking out on a passageway, a bridge between the\
  \ familial context of an airport into the unknown. A leap ten years in the making\
  \ and my mind is sharp, but anxious with fear of what it will be or more so what\
  \ it won\u2019t be.\n\nI take my first big inhale as the doors of the elevator open\
  \ and a sense of pride ensues. I made this happen and now everything is opening\
  \ up.  All the possibilities are here. My expectation is high, perhaps to my own\
  \ detriment. This feels scary. \n\nSix days in, and one random decision to turn\
  \ right  finds me walking up to ruins on a hill forgotten by people and time. The\
  \ weather shifts, the wind whips a familiar roar, yet a completely mysterious landscape\
  \ surrounds me. Bitterly frozen and squinting from sideways rain, yet I am ecstatic.\
  \  This moment I dreamt of on my plane ride home.  \n\nTwo days left and slowed\
  \ on the road by livestock. I am paused in thought to match sheep\u2019s pace. Memories\
  \ run of my Father, we were supposed to come here together. The exhilaration felt\
  \ in the midst of traveling is great, but it\u2019s the reasons why, the fears &\
  \ hopes before and the insight that arises after. \n\nIt\u2019s the last night,\
  \ laying in bed and it occurs to me why I came here. It was to leap into an unknown\
  \ part of myself, to surpasses my expectation. \n\nOne month since my return and\
  \ I sit in that same chair, sunken in contemplation.  It was Saint Augustine who\
  \ said,\_\u201CThe world\_is\_a book, and\_those who do not travel read only a page.\u201D\
  \  My answer to the fourth question surfaces. My words have a place after all, perhaps\
  \ on a page in the book of this world. \n\nThree years since and I\u2019ve continued\
  \ to travel, to write, to grow. The next leap unknown."
