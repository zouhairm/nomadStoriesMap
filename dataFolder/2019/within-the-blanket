Text: "She had given birth to her first child. Shortly thereafter, she found herself\
  \ pregnant again. This meek yet kind-hearted young woman wanted to do right for\
  \ her children. Vested in their wellbeing, she chose not to breastfeed her daughter\
  \ while pregnant, as she perceived it would interrupt the development and growth\
  \ of her fetus. \n\nIntending to serve, to give back and to experience health care\
  \ in the developing world, I packed my creature comforts and boarded the plane destined\
  \ to eventually land in Moshi, Tanzania. A nursing student at the time, the textbook\
  \ diagnoses quickly came alive. Those diseases that went unacknowledged in the university\
  \ classroom persisted in the patients admitted at Saint Joseph\u2019s Hospital,\
  \ a community hospital and clinic nestled at the base of the infamous Mount Kilimanjaro.\
  \ \n\nEach morning, I travelled down the dusty roads jostled by the dala- dala (public\
  \ transportation in a large van). I anxiously anticipated what the day held. Who\
  \ would I encounter? What would I bear witness to?\n\nApprehensively awaiting the\
  \ health care team, fear abounded on the thin, spring ridden hospital mattress.\
  \ The young mother sat with her two tiny children. Unintentionally starved, this\
  \ nine-month-old child was precisely the size of her newborn brother. The infant\u2019\
  s expressionless face peeked out of the blanket, showing signs of hopelessness.\
  \ She lacked the energy reserves to show animated emotion. The sunken, glassy eyes\
  \ shot right to my heart. \nWe unwrapped her swaddle to see what remained. To find\
  \ a nine month old baby smaller than my childhood American Girl Doll was the last\
  \ thing I expected. Her limbs were wasted and malnourished. Her head appeared massive\
  \ atop her ill-fed body. \n\nThis young mother\u2019s nine-month-old daughter had\
  \ developed Kwashiorkor, a protein and energy wasting disease resulting from severe\
  \ malnutrition. The beautiful body that lay bundled in that blanket told a powerful\
  \ story. There was hope. Healing was possible. As quick as I was to criticize this\
  \ mother for starving her child, the judgment was fleeting as I came to realize\
  \ the mere value of simple health education. \n\nWalking away, journal in hand,\
  \ I reflected on this powerful interaction. There is nothing more transformative\
  \ than basic human connection. Once trust is established, transformative change\
  \ can take place. The next time I jump to judgment, I\u2019ll remind myself to step\
  \ back and listen to the story first. I\u2019ll challenge myself to walk the footsteps\
  \ of that stranger."
