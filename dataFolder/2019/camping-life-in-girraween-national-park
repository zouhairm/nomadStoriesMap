Text: "Quick treatment with no construction but loads of excitement, keeping adventurous\
  \ activity in mind we are ready to head to the destinations. The words were functioning\
  \ towards my ear heating up if I would blend the camping trip, and I asked Anu with\
  \ whom we are going with, she easily said Kamal dai is a planner. I was just thrilled\
  \ the destination we are heading up and finally, i got confirmed terminal that is\
  \ Girraween National Park.\nI checked the map and showed approximately 3 hours and\
  \ 4-minute drive which is almost 260 km from Brisbane, located -southeast of Brisbane.\
  \ Though it is a long distance drive, driving through Cunningham\u2019s Gap with\
  \ the view of Main Range National Park and it\u2019s very scenic and beautiful views\
  \ will make your driving more rewardable experience.\n\nHalf day was already gone\
  \ preparing at home and packing down and looking spaces in each others vehicle if\
  \ we can adjust more stuff, and we asked Bhim if he can bring some waters, corn\
  \ cub while starts driving as we knew he will be in rush cause he has to start to\
  \ drive after 3.30 pm or almost 4 pm, and driving all the way over 3 hours was not\
  \ a joke during the night but we encourage him as he was also excited for camping\
  \ trip.\nWhile driving we met New England Highway 26km south of Stanthorpe or 30km\
  \ north of Tenterfield with excitement driving. We were kept in touch with Kamal\
  \ dai as Anu was kept making a call to Kamal dai if they were near us or a little\
  \ far away and satisfied that we are on the right track to the destination. Finally,\
  \ they were waiting for us on the left side having oranges, apples where we joined\
  \ biting some fruits.\n\nCRCA is one of the camping areas at Girrawan which more\
  \ like a flatter and more suitable for caravans where we camped our home. We were\
  \ already behind reaching there so we choose straightaway rather than Bald Rock\
  \ Camping area. We set up our all camping and had memorable dinner but I was worried\
  \ about Bhim as he was on the way as there was no any reception for mobiles or internet.\
  \ The area was quite colder than Brisbane city but which quite easily acceptable\
  \ for me and hold that much cold. My brain kept calling my thoughts if Bhim is somewhere\
  \ nearby and I asked If Kamal dai would want to walk with me up the road to see\
  \ if Bhim is almost to arrive. The fresh cloud was falling from our mouth which\
  \ we could see in the torch rays while walking up to frog and toad, but there was\
  \ no any sign that Bhim is near to us. Kamal dai asked me better come with a car\
  \ and wait here and we did the same trick. We went back to the camp, jumped in a\
  \ car and headed again, this time we drive a little further more if we could phone\
  \ reception, after a little more drive we could get in touch with phone tower, we\
  \ made a phone call to Bhim got confirmed he was 40 minutes away, we explained the\
  \ camping area and told him we gonna hang Nepalese flag on the signboard then move\
  \ to the right side, we are much comfortable now and back to the camping area.\n\
  \nWe spent two nights at Castle Rock Camping area, the first night was not enough\
  \ time to explore but was the perfect time to have dinner night with new friends\
  \ where we could hear birds singing and kangaroos walking around us. The area was\
  \ perfectly set up for a campfire where you can use firewood lit the light and heat\
  \ up yourself to avoid cold.\n\nMy favorite part was climbing the Pyramid, If you\
  \ have a health or physical fitness problem I would suggest you not to climb the\
  \ Rock Pyramid but once you are on top I would say take your breath view the whole\
  \ Girraween National Park. If you are with your kids then it is important to supervise\
  \ your child all the time and avoid yourself stepping up while it is wet, raining."
