Text: "Two months. Eight weeks. Sixty-two days. I glanced outside the window as the\
  \ plane jilted and turned the corner. My stomach did the familiar flip that came\
  \ along with the twists and turns of flying. I could see the tops of the flat buildings\
  \ within the desert. A smile began to spread across my face. Israel. The country\
  \ that people snickered about after it was mentioned in a lecture. The strong accent\
  \ I heard from teachers and friends growing up in the depths of the suburbs. The\
  \ country I turned my back on when the rest of the world shut it out. Israel. I\
  \ was finally going to see what this controversial and strong-willed country was\
  \ all about. \n\nMy eyes filled with tears as I stood on the rooftop of the Aish-Hatorah\
  \ building. This was it. The Western Wall. I looked down at the mass of people from\
  \ all walks of life gluing their hands to the age-old stones and closing their eyes\
  \ in prayer. A lengthy division in the middle separated the men and the women. The\
  \ sounds of singing and laughter mixed with tears and powerful prayer filled the\
  \ air. A lump formed in my throat as I watched strangers embrace each other and\
  \ put a hand on the shoulder of a sobbing person. This is what I came here for.\n\
  \nThe bus jostled along the bumpy roads, passing through miles of sandy desert.\
  \ Chatter filled the bus but I was silent. We were headed towards the Gaza border.\
  \ As soon as I started learning about Israel, Gaza was one of the first places thrown\
  \ in my face. The hard-core Israelis wanted to know why this prized piece of land\
  \ was ever given up. The anti-Israel crowd wanted what they called the occupation\
  \ of the Israeli people to end and for the soldiers to pull-out of every part of\
  \ the country - just like Gaza. I needed to see this area for myself, I was dying\
  \ to speak to the IDF soldiers and see into the land that was so contentious. Upon\
  \ arrival, I pushed my way to the front and went with the first group to climb the\
  \ steep staircase to the top of the wall and peer into Gaza. With shaky legs, I\
  \ began the climb, holding onto the railing for support. \n\nOnce I reached the\
  \ top, I was alone with our guide. I squinted against the sun and gazed into the\
  \ dark landscape that housed the refugees who believed Israel belonged to them.\
  \ \"Look to the right,\" said the guide, pointing towards a yellow conveyer belt.\
  \ One half was in Israel, the other half was in Gaza. \"Look at the end of the Gaza\
  \ side,\" he added. I put my hand on my forehead and shielded my eyes so I could\
  \ see better. The conveyer belt seemed to stop as it peaked into Gaza. \"What is\
  \ it for?\" I asked. \"It was for the people of Gaza. It was Israel's way of bringing\
  \ in exports and imports so they would not put the soldiers at risk by doing the\
  \ exchange directly with citizens of Gaza who might pose as a security threat. There\
  \ have been bombing and shootings in the past. This was the solution,\" he told\
  \ me. I nodded, chewing on the idea. \"What happened to the Gaza side?\" I asked.\
  \ \"They burnt it down,\" he responded, curtly. I sucked air into my lungs, contemplating\
  \ what this meant. I looked down at the stairs below me, bracing myself to descend.\
  \ \n\nThe holy land. The place two peoples hold their claim to. The controversy\
  \ and mystery of the world. I went and I saw. I ate hummus and I drank mango juice,\
  \ the sweet and salty mix could still be felt under my tongue. I did not have an\
  \ answer to the problems that riddled the country and its surrounding areas. I did\
  \ know that I saw more compassion, bravery, and honesty than I had ever seen in\
  \ my life. Two months was not long enough to unlock the secrets that lay within\
  \ the country. Stepping onto the plane, I knew I had to mull over everything I had\
  \ seen but return soon to discover more."
