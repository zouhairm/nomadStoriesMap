Text: "The town center was bursting with energy. There was a full-blown festival taking\
  \ over the city, filled with vendors, games, musical acts, and even a Bachelor party.\
  \ The air was fresh with the mountain breeze and the smell of brick oven pizza dancing\
  \ around me. I grabbed some gelato and walked about to see everything this unexpected\
  \ event had to offer. \n\nThe band was rocking out in full force with one 80s throwback\
  \ after another. We were all dancing the night away, showing off our twists and\
  \ turns many of us learned swing dancing growing up. Taking a quick breather from\
  \ all the fancy footwork, I took a lap around the side of the festival I had yet\
  \ to explore. After passing the rowdy Bachelor party doing shots and forcing one\
  \ of the guys into the dunk tank, I saw it -- a giant inflatable airbag just like\
  \ they use in movies for stunts. \n\nAs I got closer, I saw a cherry picker taking\
  \ people up into the sky to jump, dive, and flip into this stunt bag.  I had never\
  \ in my life seen anything like this. I was young, curious, and just stupid enough\
  \ to investigate. Once I got to the stand, I noticed some young people sitting at\
  \ a table with a stack of papers and a cash box. The two girls glanced at me as\
  \ I walked up, clearly noticing that I was American. They explained to me that it\
  \ cost one Euro to jump and that the papers, that were in German, were liability\
  \ forms. \n\nI hadn\u2019t even decided if I was going to do it or not, and already\
  \ adrenaline was pumping through my veins. I had always been terrified of heights\
  \ and, more notably so, terrified of falling to my death. But like I mentioned,\
  \ I was just stupid enough. I consulted with my friends if I should do it, to which\
  \ they obviously said of course. \n\nThat was it. No backing out now. I start walking\
  \ back to the table to sign the form, pay my Euro, and jump. On my walk over, it\
  \ hits me that I am wearing a skirt and miles from my hotel. But it was too late.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t back out now. I had committed to experience. As I was filling\
  \ out the form, I could hear the girls giggling at my skirt predicament. I smacked\
  \ down my Euro, and it was go-time.\n\nI scurried over to the bright orange cherry\
  \ picker along with four other people just crazy enough to jump off this death trap.\
  \ As the machine ascended, I could feel my heart starting to pound in my chest and\
  \ my hands start to clam up. Suddenly, the ride up comes to a jolting halt. \u201C\
  It\u2019s time to jump,\u201D said the 20-something operator flipping his long black\
  \ hair out of his eyes. I was last in line, so I had a second to hype myself up.\
  \ As my turn came around, I had talked myself so into it that I said, \u201CThis\
  \ isn\u2019t high enough. I want to go higher.\u201D To which the boy replied, \u201C\
  If it\u2019s your first jump you have to go at the low level.\u201D I smirked and\
  \ coaxed, \u201CI paid for this. I want to go higher.\u201D After batting my eyelashes\
  \ a few times, he obliged. I was then three stories in the air about to jump onto\
  \ this enormous grey inflatable with no knowledge of whether or not this was safe.\
  \ I counted down to myself, \u201CThree, two, one and a half......one,\u201D and\
  \ jumped into that fresh mountain air. For a second, it felt like time had stopped,\
  \ and I was floating. Then - SMACK -  back into reality I hit the bag with a loud\
  \ noise but a soft landing. As I rolled to the corner to exits my safety net, I\
  \ could hear my friends laughing hysterically. Here, while I was too concerned about\
  \ hyping myself up enough to jump, I forgot about my skirt and holding it down.\
  \ The entire town square saw my butt, but at the end of the day, I conquered a fear,\
  \ tried something new, and made a great memory."
