Text: "Some experiences are too valuable to be exchanged with money. This is what\
  \ my last travel experience taught me. It was July 23 2018, when my friends and\
  \ I took a trip from Jakarta, Indonesia, to Banyuwangi, East Java, Indonesia. There\
  \ were eight of us. We went there by train and we had to use two economy class trains\
  \ to get there. First, we took a train named Jayabaya, the one that took us to Surabaya,\
  \ East Java. From Surabaya, we got into a train named Probowangi that took us to\
  \ Banyuwangi. It was a long trip, but a fun one. We traveled for two days until\
  \ we arrived in Banyuwangi at July 24, in the evening. \nOne of us had a house in\
  \ Banyuwangi, so we stayed there. Other than that one friend of mine, all of us\
  \ had not been visit Banyuwangi before. My friend\u2019s mother and father are warm\
  \ people and incredibly welcoming. They provided us food while we were there for\
  \ three days. When we first arrived at their house, they gave us a dinner named\
  \ Tempong Rice. It consists of a steamy white rice served with steamed vegetables\
  \ and raw condiment. \u201CTempong\u201D in Indonesian language means \u201Cslap\u201D\
  . It is because the spicy taste on this food will make us feel like we\u2019ve been\
  \ slapped. The side dishes for this cuisine can be a friend chicken, omelet, or\
  \ Pepes Ikan (spicy steamed fish). After we had dinner, we rested for the day. \n\
  The next day, we went to Kawah Ijen (Ijen Crater), which located at the exact top\
  \ of Mount Ijen, one of a series of volcanoes in East Java, in between Banyuwangi\
  \ and Bondowoso district. The crater has a beautiful lake with blue-green water.\
  \ The elevation of the crater is 2,799 m (9,183 ft) and the air temperature is cold,\
  \ usually around 10\xB0 Celsius, although sometimes the temperature drops as low\
  \ as 2\xB0 Celsius. Therefore, we need to put lot of fabric layers before we went\
  \ for hiking. We were hiking from 2 AM. While we were hiking, there were lot of\
  \ people got sick because of the bad weather. It was a bit rainy and it was really\
  \ cold. Finally, we made it to the top at 5 AM, just in time before the sunrise.\
  \ However, we didn\u2019t get to see its beautiful lake because it was foggy. We\
  \ were really happy. We took pictures and we were talking with the fellow hikers\
  \ there. We went down again around 9 AM. It was even harder than hiking it because\
  \ of the steepness, but it\u2019s faster. After the hiking, we went back to my friend\u2019\
  s house. \nThe second day in Banyuwangi, we visited Baluran National Park. It is\
  \ located in Sumberwaru village, Banyuwangi district, Situbondo, East Java. Baluran\
  \ National Park is a forest preservation area that extends about 25.000 ha. It has\
  \ a beautiful panorama and often called as The Savannah of Java. That\u2019s because\
  \ the view which look a savannah field and there are many exotic animals such as\
  \ wild pigs, deer, peacocks, wild chicken, some species of monkeys, and also bulls\
  \ as the protected animals in the area. We were enjoying our time there for hours.\
  \ We visited some of places there like Gua Jepang (Japan Cave), Bekol Savannah,\
  \ and Bama Beach. Gua Jepang is a historical place in which a battle between Indonesia\
  \ army against Japanese army happened in the past. Bekol Savannah is a place where\
  \ we watched animals doing their activity, while the Bama beach was a beautiful\
  \ place of mangrove forest. We were exhausted around 5 PM and we decided to come\
  \ back to my friend\u2019s house.\nThe last day in Banyuwangi before we went back\
  \ to Jakarta, we visited a place called Pulau Merah. It is a beach located in Sumber\
  \ Agung village, Banyuwangi District, East Java. \u201CMerah\u201D means \u201C\
  red\u201D in english and it got the name because of its red-colored sand. After\
  \ the sunset we went back to my friend\u2019s house. We did the packing and hop\
  \ into the train the next morning with the same route. It was truly an amazing trip\
  \ for my friends and I."
