Text: "I had no experience in drinking \"the real\" coffe. All that i ever had was\
  \ just instant coffee where I could find at any store nearby. Since I'm not a coffee\
  \ person and never considered it to be a part of my life style before. \nIn the\
  \ mid of 2017, I was doing my community service assigment for 2 months . It was\
  \ in Pagar Alam, one of a city in Sumatera island precisely in Rimba Candi Village.\
  \ It took 2 hours by flight and around 10 up to 12 hours by bus. As I sat on the\
  \ bus, my brain went busy by thinking and my heart was pounding. I was always wondering\
  \ like ,where was it ? what was there ? Pagar Alam is not a well known city. I only\
  \ had a few information about it that time. I was quiet nerveous, it felt like entering\
  \ a jungle. I never knew what would wait for me. As soon as the bus reached the\
  \ village, I was speechless. Yes! It was a jungle. I'm not exagerrating and it is\
  \ not a hyperbole. I'm right, as Rimba Candi Village is located in a mountain in\
  \ the border of Sumatera forest and surroundend by coffee farm. The elders in the\
  \ village told me that, Rimba Candi was also part of the forest before they were\
  \ transmigrated. Now, it is already the third generation of the transmigrated people\
  \ who live there. Slowly, I fell in love with the nature of this place. \nMy morning\
  \ routine when I stayed in Rimba Candi was enjoying the cold morning breeze while\
  \ wacthing the Mount Dempo from the veranda, waving at the children who off to school,\
  \ greeting the people who went to the field farming coffee, most of them were mother.\
  \ Coffee is the main commodity and also the main income in Rimba Candi. Most family\
  \ there have their own coffe field near the forest, they usually inherit the land\
  \ and the skill from their parents. I was amazed by the culture of the people. Where\
  \ coffee have been becoming their diet. When I was observing their daily life. I\
  \ always found coffee in their daily menu. They drank it every morning alongside\
  \ with breakfast, in the afternoon when the came back from the farm, in the evening\
  \ as well. They always served coffee for the guest or visitor.  Coffee is their\
  \ part of life.\nThe culture woke my curiousity. So, a week after I arrived, for\
  \ the first time  in my life I tried it. And \"the real coffee \" was not bad though.\
  \ So, continuosly I had it for a week. My body wasn't used to it and perhaps it\
  \ was not ready either. So, after the coffee week I got a stomachache and a diarrhea.\
  \ Well then, after those experience eventhough I'm still not a coffee person but\
  \ it already became the part of my life."
