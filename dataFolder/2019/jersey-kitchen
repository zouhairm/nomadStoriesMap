Text: "After a day of train-hoping, architecture hunting and the discovery of francesinha,\
  \ a Portuguese meaty sandwich-like creation, only rivaled by the French-Canadian\
  \ Poutine, I was ready to call it a night. Being the last night in Oporto however,\
  \ the night owl in me decided in favor of a night cap. Throwing on my jacket I headed\
  \ out of the hostel, where to go? I thought. Downhill, best to gain some momentum\
  \ before I change my mind; so I let my feet drive, weaving up and down through dimly\
  \ lit streets across a thousand cobblestoned hills.  \n\n20 minutes later and thirsty,\
  \ I spotted the red glow of a paper lantern halfway up a side street, I could see\
  \ a few patrons gathered outside. Encircled in tobacco haze, tinted by the lantern\u2019\
  s ember hue and coupled with the cacophony escaping the bar nearby, the scene before\
  \ me was surreal; like a modern impressionist painting of a waiting room outside\
  \ purgatory.  As I approached, a couple characters on the fringe, a sharp-nosed\
  \ woman with an all too short miniskirt and inefficiently large fishnet stockings;\
  \ accompanied with a leather vested, tattooed, grizzly bearded man, headed back\
  \ into the bar.  Seizing the opportunity to glimpse what lay inside I followed close\
  \ behind. Neon, black lights and dancing poles. Hmm\u2026perhaps not tonight, I\
  \ thought, as the door closed sealing them in. I turned and headed back down toward\
  \ the main street. \n\nPaces from the main street and still questioning my hasty\
  \ decision, I was jolted back to reality just in time to sidestep as a frenzied\
  \ man came rushing by from a nearby alley. I must have missed this on the way up.\
  \ \u201CFilho da puta!\u201D howled a figure up the alley. Instinctively my feet\
  \ ushered me forward, and partway up the alley under the cool vanilla light of an\
  \ epileptic fluorescent was a literal hole in the wall establishment. A simple two\
  \ stove kitchen with a meagerly stocked bar, tucked behind a corrugated metal bar\
  \ top in a small 4 x 6 meter space that spewed into the alleyway.  As I approached\
  \ the proprietor scanned me, satisfied I wasn\u2019t the previous offender, he offered\
  \ me a seat and asked what I would have in Portuguese. I replied in Spanglish, noting\
  \ that my Spanish was rough, and I spoke little Portuguese. \u201CThat\u2019s alright,\
  \ I lived in New Jersey for a while, how\u2019s my English?\u201D\n\nThree drinks\
  \ later, I learnt he was a sous-chef who had worked in some mafioso-esque kitchens\
  \ in New Jersey, where he learnt English, Italian and a few life lessons. He had\
  \ moved back for his girl, \u201Cminha gatinha\u201D as he put it. She had recently\
  \ given birth to their daughter, at which point I noticed the pram on the far side\
  \ of the kitchen beside stairs to the apartment. \u201CShe keeps papa company when\
  \ mamas\u2019 asleep, \u201Che noted, pointing at the ceiling.  I chuckled and proceeded\
  \ to do some sharing of my own. \n\n7 drinks further and my host, as this had become\
  \ an intimate affair now, offered to make us something to eat. Before long we were\
  \ indulging in what, I now know to be the best francesinha to date; nothing beats\
  \ a warm home cooked meal in the belly of the night. We spoke further at length,\
  \ like two old cats quarreling over a dumpster, philosophizing about the things\
  \ one should never over-think, lie about, or let go of. As night waned and dawn\
  \ threatened an appearance, I was reminded of my flight back to Madrid in what was\
  \ now a few short hours. Expressing this, I thanked my new friend, helped clear\
  \ up and proceeded to pay. \u201CYour money is no good here!\u201D he bawled with\
  \ a Jersey accent and an even louder grin. Elated I bawled back, \u201Cthen one\
  \ last drink for the road?\u201D He nodded, and mixing with his back turned, I sneaked\
  \ over to the pram, took out all I had in my wallet and stuffed it below the sleeping\
  \ babe\u2019s feet, slipping back to the bar. What a night, I thought, as I bid\
  \ them farewell and went off in search of the hostel and a few winks before sunrise."
