Text: "It all started with a random idea in a rainy morning at Bidholi, Uttarakhand\
  \ just 2 days before Holi. One of our friend stayed over for a night to our flat\
  \ and we played cards cooked food and enjoyed. Somewhere around 6 in the morning\
  \ someone suggested a trip to Vrindavan or Mathura. It was just a joke but everyone\
  \ there took it so seriously that within few seconds everyone in the room said \"\
  yes\" and by evening we even got our reservations sorted and were at ISBT Dehradun\
  \ before 10 pm a little we knew then that this was the begining to an ultimate trip.\n\
  \uFFFC\nFor those of you who don't know Holi is the festival of colours is celebrated\
  \ through out India and some other parts of world as well. But Holi in Brij region\
  \ is specially famous. This region includes Mathura, Vrindavan and near by areas.\n\
  \nWe boarded our bus from ISBT, Dehradun to Saharanpur as we had our latenight rail\
  \ reservation from Saharanpur to Agra.\n\nWe reached Agra in the morning booked\
  \ a room close to The Taj Mahal and went out to explore the city for a day. We visited\
  \ Taj, Agra fort and a few other places we even bought us some pethas (local special\
  \ sweet dish of Agra), and decided to have dinner in a restaurant close to our room.\
  \ Then we went to bed a little early and before sleeping we planned a few things\
  \ about the next day.\n\uFFFC\nNext morning we were up early out of excitement and\
  \ the clamour from the streets somewhere around 9 in the morning. The streets below\
  \ were painted red, blue and green and we can clearly hear people greeting each\
  \ other \"Holi hai\". Between all the chaos somehow we managed to get an auto rickshaw\
  \ for the Railwaystation. It was just 2 hours journey from Agra to Mathura and we\
  \ reached there somewhere around 12 in the afternoon.\n\nWhen we reached Mathura\
  \ Railwaystation we were expecting colours flying in the air but it was a little\
  \ different than what we were expecting. It was all quite and was almost opposite\
  \ of what we thought earlier. So, we booked a 3-wheeler tempo to Vrindavan from\
  \ there.\n\nIt is at a distance of around 10-12 km from Mathura railwaystation and\
  \ takes around 1 hours to reach there. Vrindavan was a completely different place.\
  \ I will try to share my experience the best I can but trust me no words have been\
  \ discovered so far which can precisely explain the beauty in chaos persisting there.\n\
  \uFFFC\nWe started to walk on the main road towards Banke Bihari Temple completely\
  \ covered with light pink coloured dust made of natural elements. There were temples\
  \ on both the sides and strangers wishing \"Happy Holi\" with colours and such warm\
  \ regards like they have been knowing you since your childhood. The energy in the\
  \ environment was really electrifying. Like the whole world collided into a singularity\
  \ for a single day. Each and every culture and community united by a single emotion.\n\
  \uFFFC\nPeople were enjoying various dishes on both the corners in between the flying\
  \ colours of Holi. People from different corners of the world were there to witness\
  \ that event.\n\nThe one very touching event which I can never forget, a kid approached\
  \ me to wish me \"Bura na mano Holi hai\" and threw colour at us and on the left\
  \ were his parents and a small tent in which he used to live with his parents and\
  \ an even younger brother. It was heartbreaking at first but the energy and enthusiasm\
  \ in the eyes of the guy were phenomenal. Looking at the camera he posed Infront\
  \ of me he offered to take a picture of himself.\n\uFFFC\nAfter spending some time\
  \ there we again started walking towards the temple through the crowded streets\
  \ and market place and then after enjoying some sweet dishes and snacks (lassi and\
  \ kachoris) there, we started our way back to Mathura.\n\nIn the end, just for the\
  \ sake of concluding my journey. I would like to put a line forward.\n\n\"We reached\
  \ there empty-handed, but left with lots of memories and uniques experiences for\
  \ a lifetime.\"\n\uFFFC"
