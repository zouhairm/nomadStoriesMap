  \              We moved from Okara and had first stay at Lalla Musa. It was a nice\
  \ place and as the Pakistanis love food this place is famous for \"Daal\"(beans)\
  \ its daal has a unique taste.Then we continue our journey and reach Murrey.The\
  \ place which is beautiful with its greenery.It is famous for the conifers trees\
  \ and i for the first time saw monkeys moving from one place to another.It was a\
  \ fascinating view for all of us.There were many apple trees their.And we saw small\
  \ and less ripe apples there.These are the things of nature which attracts the man\
  \ \nAs it is well said\n         \"The thing of beauty is joy forever.\"\n     \
  \   We spent night in Murree. The Mall Road of Murree is famous for its beauty.A\
  \ large number of foreigners come and enjoy there every year.Mostly the shopkeepers\
  \ are Pathan's. These are the most loyal and sincere persons i found there.They\
  \ give respect to every person and are very kind hearted person.We all like them.Mostly\
  \ people love the wooden things of Murree which include the chairs,walking sticks,\
  \ cigarrette boxes.These things fascinate all the foreigners. \n       The next\
  \ day we go to \"Patriata\" a beautiful place .It is famous for the \"chair lift\"\
  \ and \"cable car\". By going on chair lift we have the view of the whole area.\
  \ It enchants the complete area.I am completely lost in the beauty of the green\
  \ meadows there.\n As it is well said\n      \"A man's heart away from nature becomes\
  \ hard.\"\n         We had lunch on the patriata top it was a mesmerizing moment\
  \ for me.At patriata i for the first time experience to shot a fire.It was a gane\
  \ to shot fire and i the fire hit with any of the bottles which are hanging with\
  \ the tree you will get the prize.It was a unique game which i played for the first\
  \ time and me and my friends enjoyed it alot.\n        The next day we visited \"\
  Pearl Continental Hotel Bhurban\". The PC Bhurban is surrounded by large number\
  \ of trees all around and it is a beautiful site to view.PC was really a pleasing\
  \ place to visit. It has an attractive building and here we have a \"High Tea\"\
  \ there.High tea is a unique thing in it there are almost every thing it include\
  \ all of the local and famous pakistani things they include samosas,chicken pieces,drum\
  \ sticks,fruit chat,nuggets,french fries,fruit salad,jalebi,gulab jaman and tea\
  \ there.It was really a nice experience and we enjoyed there alot.\n      The next\
  \ day we return from Murree.And we came to Islamabad.We had lunch in \"Savours Islamabad\"\
  .A place which is famous for \"Chicken Pulaoo\"(Chicken Rice). We enjoyed it and\
  \ then visited the \"Faisal Mosque\"Islamabad. It was decorated with a fine architect\
  \ which attract the eyes.We pray the Asr prayer there.Tgen we go to \"Lake View\
  \ Park\".We do boating there and enjoyed alot. \n              This was a beautiful\
  \ trip and it will every shine in my minds eye like a nice memory.I can never forget\
