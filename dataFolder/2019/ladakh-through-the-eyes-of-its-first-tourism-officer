Text: "Mohammad Deen Khan was happy in retirement when the planning department of\
  \ Leh, the northern town in the Indian region of Ladakh, approached him to helm\
  \ a one-of-a-kind project. The mountainous region of Ladakh is known for its striking\
  \ landscapes, but the Central Asian Museum now gives you a look into its hidden,\
  \ yet glorious past.\n\nMy fourth trip into this picturesque region was about discovering\
  \ the hitherto unexplored areas in the cold desert. A rainy September afternoon\
  \ was the perfect day to walk around the city centre, along the 17th century mosque\
  \ that dominates the cityscape, which is under renovation. I asked a frail old gentleman\
  \ sitting at the entrance for a light. Further enquiry led Mr. Khan to introduce\
  \ himself as the founder of the Central Asian Museum, and the several hats he has\
  \ worn since he became the first tourism officer of Ladakh in the early 1970s.\n\
  \nThe renovation of the mosque is being done after archeologists dug under the structure\
  \ and unearthed stones with glyphs carved into them, dating back to the 4th century,\
  \ and don\u2019t resemble any modern language. \u201CA Buddhist monk, who lives\
  \ seven days away from the city on the Stok Kangri route (6153m, the highest mountain\
  \ in the Stok range), is going to help us interpret it.\u201D Majority of the people\
  \ here are Buddhist, while the other half of the local population is Muslim.\n\n\
  The entrance of the museum showcases a timeline of the numerous rulers Ladakh has\
  \ seen since the 1st century. The mosque itself was built after King Senge Namgyal\
  \ gave local traders permission to use the land along where caravans used to camp\
  \ for the night. The museum is also built around the same area, and although the\
  \ modern fa\xE7ade of the city centre doesn\u2019t quite reflect it, the bylanes\
  \ still retain some of Ladakh\u2019s past allure.\n\nMr. Khan\u2019s own history\
  \ is just as fascinating. His great grandfather emigrated from the Central Asian\
  \ region of Yarkand, which is in modern day Xinjiang in China. His mother was the\
  \ first person to translate the Bible into Ladakhi. \u201CShe could converse in\
  \ Persian, Turkish, English, Urdu and Yarkand,\u201D he says. Christianity spread\
  \ through the region via the Moravian people who migrated to Ladakh. There is a\
  \ Moravian school in Leh as well. \n\nDeen Khan was instrumental in the setting\
  \ up of the India operations for Save the Children Foundation, and was recognized\
  \ by the British Government for his efforts. He also manages the local projects\
  \ run by the Australian charitable organisation, Lille Fro, and has been elected\
  \ into the Ladakh Municipal Committee as its vice-president in November 2018. His\
  \ own residence, Khan Manzil, became the first \u201Chotel\u201D to be opened here\
  \ in 1975, after the first wave of tourists started arriving in the region.\n \n\
  \u201CIt took about four years to build the museum,\u201D he says. \u201CWe had\
  \ decided we were going to build it using only local craftsmen and labour, while\
  \ the design was done by the late Andr\xE9 Alexander, a German architect.\u201D\
  \ Mr. Khan, however, laments the lack of written history of the region, especially\
  \ in the local languages, part of the reason why a project like this took so long\
  \ to begin. \u201CWe just have to go by the oral history that people have heard\
  \ from their ancestors.\u201D Ladakh\u2019s rich trade history means it is often\
  \ called the Suez Canal of Central Asia.\n\nBesides ancient stone carvings, picture\
  \ exhibitions containing the earliest Silk Route traders, officers in the British\
  \ army and the nomadic people making arduous journeys on foot over snow-covered\
  \ mountains are deeply moving, as are the items of clothing that people used to\
  \ wear over a century ago. The modernization of the region, much like any urban\
  \ city anywhere in the world, means areas of historical significance are often neglected.\
  \ \u201CI grew up playing in the Sarai, where the new Police Station is coming up,\u201D\
  \ says Mr. Khan.\n\nA light drizzle became stronger as the day progressed, and the\
  \ fascinating conversation over multiple cups of chai had to finally come to an\
  \ end, but with the desire to learn more about the common history that we share,\
  \ of origins and belongings, and through words written or spoken."
