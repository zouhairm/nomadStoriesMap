Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s because the Matterhorn is the archetypal mountain\u201D Mrs.\
  \ Carla says quoting Herv\xE9 Barmasse, one of the greatest alpinists of our times,\
  \ record holder of new routes, first-solo and first-winter ascents on this mountain.\
  \ Like her, he is from Valtournenche, a village in the Aosta Valley (North-Western\
  \ Italy), where we are enjoying a short early-June escape from the everyday routine.\
  \ \u201CBecause it\u2019s a perfect triangle, it\u2019s the shape kids draw when\
  \ they draw a mountain\u201D. For a moment Mrs. Carla lifts those grey-green, thin\
  \ eyes with dusky eyebrows so characteristic of the local villagers, shaped from\
  \ the same rock and soil of the surrounding mountain range. She keeps whipping not\
  \ less than eight eggs for a cheese-and-ham omelet, what is considered here the\
  \ absolute minimum breakfast necessary to stay strong during a hiking day. \nAs\
  \ a kid I watched \u201CThe mountain calls\u201D, an old German movie about the\
  \ first ascent on the Matterhorn. The desire to see this mountain has quietly obsessed\
  \ me ever since, though I cannot explain why. From Mrs. Carla\u2019s answer I know\
  \ that to her my fascination is normal. Maybe she is right, it really is the archetypal\
  \ mountain, but I think there is more to that that makes it special. The Matterhorn\
  \ comes with countless stories of grandiose deeds and dramatic tragedies. For example\
  \ the first unsuccessful attempts at the time of the heroic mountaineering, when\
  \ the leaders of newly unified Italy stubbornly wanted a great feat to boost the\
  \ national spirit. Finally the Italian team led by the Valtournenche guide Jean-Antoine\
  \ Carrel was anticipated on the top by Edward Whymper, half of whose party would\
  \ then tragically die on the way back. Or when, hundred years later, Walter Bonatti\
  \ was the first to climb solo the north face in the winter of 1965. It is all this\
  \ and much more that brought us here.\nMy partner and I arrived in Valtournenche\
  \ three days ago. We hiked among proud ibexes on the left side of the valley towards\
  \ the Cignana Lake. We hiked on the right side across colorful flowering meadows,\
  \ along the \u201CGran Balconata del Cervino\u201D (Italian for the \u201CGreat\
  \ Balcony on the Matterhorn\u201D) from Cheneil all the way to Breuil, at the feet\
  \ of the mountain. These are all Matterhorn-view trails, supposedly. But in these\
  \ days the top has always been hidden in the clouds. Sometimes the Pic Tyndall would\
  \ shyly make an appearance, letting me still for half hours thinking \u201Calmost\u2026\
  \ almost\u2026\u201D, as if the top were not hundreds of meters higher up. This\
  \ morning we drove to Breuil at dawn, hoping for a clear view before the humidity\
  \ of the night would rise from the valley and cover everything again. We surrendered\
  \ four hours later, around ten o\u2019clock, and drove back to Valtournenche for\
  \ breakfast, which is when we chatted with Mrs. Carla about my fascination. It is\
  \ our fourth, and last, day here. Tomorrow we head back home.\nBecause of our early\
  \ wake up it feels like it is afternoon already but it is barely eleven. So we hit\
  \ the road again, following the trail that from Valtournenche gently ascends to\
  \ the little village of Chamois. We take a break at the charming Lod Lake. The surrounding\
  \ mountain peaks mirror in its waters and a heavenly stillness heals the frustration\
  \ of our unsuccessful morning quest. Now we have a strong motivation to come back\
  \ again, we think, as if we needed any, we add. Because the day has turned out beautiful\
  \ and warm we decide to continue our hike along the path that steeply climbs uphill\
  \ to unite with the Balconata, then reaches Cheneil and descends back to Valtournenche.\
  \ When I arrive at Cheneil Hill, at the crossroad with the Balconata, I stop to\
  \ take a picture of my partner, who is crawling behind in a grassy sea of gold and\
  \ green. When I turn and watch where the trail continues, in front of me I see it.\
  \ Clear of clouds, the perfect triangle raising up hundreds of meters higher than\
  \ the mountain ridges around. It is what brought us here. The Matterhorn, the archetypal\
  \ mountain."
