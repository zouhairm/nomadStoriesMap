Text: "Couple of years ago I made a trip to Tamil Nadu on the off chance that on this\
  \ land of Gods I might find the strength to deal with my life, which was edging\
  \ on the brinks of a sea change. Although I planned on reaching Kanyakumari, after\
  \ making several stops along the Coromandel coastline, Manapad turned out to be\
  \ the last stop in this journey.\n\nHitherto, Tamil Nadu was granting me all that\
  \ I had wished for. The bright sun, tall and sturdy coconut trees, sheep grazing\
  \ lazily on the red soil, sleeping villages, old men wearing short white dhotis\
  \ and sun-glasses and running their bikes at full speed on the highway, a sacred\
  \ mixture of the scents of thatched coconut leaf roofs, of fishermen\u2019s skins\
  \ and of the incense sticks, and the colourful temples: it was a picture full of\
  \ life. \n\nHowever, as I approached Manapad, as sceneries rolled by, shorelines\
  \ changing from tidal flats to cliffs, I smelt a strong difference in the air from\
  \ what I had encountered so far. From a distance a church built at an elevated position\
  \ came into view, growing larger with each passing stretch until an aloof colossal\
  \ white structure stood right in front of my eyes. A light house, painted with bright\
  \ red and white stripes, stood behind the church with the same aloof stance. On\
  \ our way we crossed two more majestic churches, empty lanes and old but spacious\
  \ sea-facing houses. The place took the aura of a little European coastal village,\
  \ unlike any other place in India, but had a forlorn look about it. What caught\
  \ my whole attention was, however, the deafening roars of the waves that hit the\
  \ lonesome shores beseeching a keen listener to listen to them. On taking a turn\
  \ around the church at the elevated position \u2013 the Holy Cross Church, I advent\
  \ upon an alcove, which was inhabited by a missionary some four-hundred and seventy\
  \ years ago. \n\nIncidentally, these churches were built when Manapad was a Portuguese\
  \ colony, back in the 1500s. The Holy Cross Church is believed to be alive with\
  \ a fragment from the True Cross of Jerusalem, and a miraculous story rests behind\
  \ the arrival of this Cross on the shores of Manapad. St. Francis Xavier made his\
  \ home for more than two years in this sea-facing alcove on the cliff where the\
  \ church now stood, when he came to India on missionary work in 1542. I wondered\
  \ if it was so disturbing for me to endure the heart-wrenching call of the waves\
  \ in the middle of the day in the twenty-first century, how he must have endured\
  \ the sorrow of those nights!\n\nA goatherder I met told me stories from St. Xavier\u2019\
  s times: stories of miraculous recoveries of the sick in the hands of the missionary.\
  \ He ended saying \u2018we hear St. Francis did lot for the local people during\
  \ his time, but now even with the modern means at hand, people of Manapad suffer\
  \ huge losses every time tsunami strikes and it takes years to recover. Some never\
  \ recover.' Even if he hadn\u2019t mentioned that, the local hospital with its worn\
  \ out yellow paint and goats grazing on the wild grass inside its premises spoke\
  \ volumes. On the face of such abandonment, suddenly, my own issues seemed too small.\n\
  \nUnderneath the spirit of an ardent traveller there is usually a hungry soul which\
  \ presumes it might get a piece of bread for the soul somewhere on this earth. Sometimes\
  \ it gets a piece and sometimes it confronts a whole loaf in front of it. It is\
  \ then that the overwhelmed soul refuses to move. If rest of Tamil Nadu was giving\
  \ me a piece, Manapad gave me a loaf. The haunting stillness of the afternoon despite\
  \ kids loitering around merrily on the porch of the school, the quietude of parish\
  \ life, the face of a toddler on the street, and not far away the call of the waves\
  \ rendered a very poignant picture. I wondered if the Church clocks chimed overshadowing\
  \ every other sound, even the roar of the waves, just for the sake of telling the\
  \ hour of the day or more; much more."
