Text: "Cause of death: flying hippo. I could see the coroner\u2019s report as I finally\
  \ gasped a breath on the hull of the mokoro canoe, sure it could hear my heart thudding\
  \ as the beast passed beneath us, inches below my belly, and the boat rocked. In\
  \ the part of my brain that wasn\u2019t processing whether I was still alive, I\
  \ wondered how my mum would convey the news in her Christmas round-robin email.\
  \ \n\nIt had come from nowhere. We had been laughing, reclined comfortably in the\
  \ dugout canoe as we returned to the mainland of Botswana after a night camping\
  \ out in the wild of the Okovango delta, where elephants and big cats patrolled\
  \ through the night and could pass by your tent at any time. \n\nWhen locals panic,\
  \ you know there is something seriously wrong. \u2018That was too close \u2019.\
  \ Our guide, Obonye, was shaken. \u2018Keep staying down\u2019. After several achingly\
  \ long minutes we crawled back into our seats and wove in silence back through the\
  \ rivulets we had traversed at sunrise. \n\n We had started the previous day with\
  \ a much more peaceful ride through the delta. We saw the snouts of a whole family\
  \ of hippos in the distance and gasped with delight as we glided by, snapping shots\
  \ of the ears and eyes poking out of the water that glinted in the late afternoon\
  \ sun. Enough of a threat to be aware of, but far away enough that they didn\u2019\
  t seem bothered with us. \u2018Keep your distance, and be quiet. Hippos don\u2019\
  t like to be startled\u2019, we were told. \u2018And they don\u2019t like it when\
  \ you get between them and the water.\u2019\n\nOn land, we pitched our tents. The\
  \ trees offered protection from the sun, but also a showering in mopane worms, the\
  \ caterpillars that are iconic in Botswana, featuring both on the currency, pula,\
  \ and in local dishes. They dripped from every tree, and I squirmed with the constant\
  \ unnerving feeling that they had dropped into my hair and clothes. We dug a hole\
  \ to shit in, sticking a loo roll on a spiked branch. Home for the night. \n\n\u2018\
  Don\u2019t pee tonight if you can help it. If you do, pee right by the tent. If\
  \ you see eyes, get straight back in. If you see green eyes, it\u2019s not a predator,\
  \ but an elephant could still panic and stampede. If you see red eyes, it\u2019\
  s a predator, and they\u2019ll be the last you\u2019ll ever see.\u2019 The warning\
  \ was enough. I chose dehydration over death with my pants down.  \n\nAs it neared\
  \ evening, the sun bled red into the sky and made the earth a glowing furnace against\
  \ which we became no more than silhouettes imprinted on the horizon. \n\nThat night,\
  \ we lit a fire to keep the animals away. Local people sang songs in the Setswana\
  \ language and encouraged us to join them in swaying hips and clapping hands. All\
  \ the while I kept an eye on the horizon for eyes of green and red.\n\nCome dawn,\
  \ it seemed the danger had passed. A quick breakfast and back in the mokoros. We\
  \ had been travelling for nearly an hour when there was a crash in the bushes. \u2018\
  Ssshhhh!\u2019 \n\nIf I had reached out an arm I could have touched the hippo we\
  \ were faced with on the bank. Its head alone was as long as my body, its yellowed\
  \ fangs as long as my hand, and sharp. And we were between it and the water. \n\n\
  It snorted, kicked its back legs. \n\n\u2018Get down\u2019. Obonye muttered under\
  \ his breath and I slid under the seat, not taking my eyes off it. We stayed that\
  \ way for several minutes, us watching it watching us. I didn\u2019t dare breathe\
  \ in case it could hear us.  I wondered how much it weighed. If it charged, would\
  \ it crush us immediately? Would we die from the impact, or drown if it brought\
  \ us under the water?\n\nThen it leapt. Inches in front of the nose of the boat\
  \ where I had been, sending a wave over us, and the boat rocked with the weight\
  \ of it pushing by. \nI didn\u2019t feel like an intrepid explorer. I felt very,\
  \ very small."
