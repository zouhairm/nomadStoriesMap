Text: "The day I moved to Singapore was the start of a long weekend so I figured I\
  \ would take trip. I decided on Malaysia since it was close.\n\nI packed my faithful\
  \ backpack, the one that has traveled with me to so many places. In it I placed\
  \ some clothes, my DSLR camera, laptop, wallet, toothbrush, toothpaste, and sunscreen.\n\
  \nI didn\u2019t do much research about how to get to Malaysia. I figured it would\
  \ be straightforward enough after reading that I could take the MRT, Singapore\u2019\
  s efficient railway, to the border where I could catch a bus to cross through immigration.\
  \ I set out that afternoon on a northbound train.\n\nAs the train flowed along the\
  \ serpentine tracks, my eyes traced the changing landscape. Rushes of excitement\
  \ and curiosity swept across my mind as dense apartments transformed into sparse\
  \ farmland. The sun had began to set, and I hadn\u2019t thought twice about where\
  \ I\u2019d stay that night.\n\nI arrived to the last train stop and followed signs\
  \ for the bus to Johor Bahru, Malaysia. I hadn\u2019t anticipated how many people\
  \ would also be traveling to Malaysia that night. Groups upon groups formed incongruous\
  \ lines for the buses that would travel to Malaysia.\n\nWeaving through the overflow\
  \ of travelers, wondering where I would buy a ticket, I approached a security guard.\
  \ I asked him about the schedule and ticketing. He said the buses were sold out\
  \ for the night and the next ones wouldn\u2019t be running until the following morning.\
  \ I asked if there was another way to get to Malaysia from the terminal. \u201C\
  You could walk.\u201D The guard motioned toward a dark tunnel that led to a bridge\
  \ across the Straits of Johor.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would have recognized\
  \ the sarcasm in his voice, or the absurdity of such a suggestion, but at that time\
  \ I was naive, daring, and unwilling to compromise my journey to Malaysia. So after\
  \ little consideration, I began walking.\n\nI passed through the dimly lit alley\
  \ and my world opened up to a roaring scene of packed buses, buzzing motorbikes,\
  \ and speeding cars competing in stop and go traffic to cross the Johor-Singapore\
  \ Causeway, a stretch of road approximately 1,050 meters (over a half mile).\n\n\
  As I walked along the slight path I felt exposed: the expansive body of water to\
  \ my left and traffic on my right. I felt the weight of my bag on my shoulders,\
  \ weight that reminded me of the costly possessions I brought along on this haphazard\
  \ journey.\n\nThoughts of panic suddenly filled my head. I remembered friends warning\
  \ me about motor-bikers who would reach out and grab the bag off the shoulder of\
  \ an unassuming passerby. Fear engrossed my mind, and I knew it was time to choose:\
  \ either faith or fear. I chose faith, mustering up as much determination and fortitude\
  \ as my stiff body and rambling mind would allow.\n\nI heard someone approach from\
  \ behind. Rather than look back nervously, I chose to stay to the right and continue\
  \ my pace.\n\nA young woman passed without a sound. She was walking quickly. I was\
  \ surprised that she too was walking the bridge alone. I decided to keep up with\
  \ her stride.\n\nThe divider which kept vehicles separate from the walkway dissipated\
  \ and I walked alongside the unpredictable traffic. Not far ahead of me I could\
  \ see that the young woman had stopped. The walkway discontinued. In order to reach\
  \ the immigration checkpoint, I had to cross traffic.\n\nI gazed across the sea\
  \ of headlights stopping and starting abruptly. I stood beside the young woman.\
  \ She looked to me. \u201CShould we cross together?\u201D\n\nWithout a thought I\
  \ said, \u201CYes.\u201D We waited a moment - there was a break in traffic. Our\
  \ arms intertwined and we ran. \n\nWe made it across safely, looked at each other\
  \ and smiled. \n\nI smoothly passed through immigration and walked to my new friend.\
  \ She told me to come with her to dinner.\n\nNot only did my kind friend take me\
  \ to dinner, she drove me to a bus station to buy a ticket to Malacca, and after,\
  \ to a hotel to arrange a room for my first night in Malaysia."
