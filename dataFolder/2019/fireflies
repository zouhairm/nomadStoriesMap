Text: "The boat juddered from the rickety jetty into the long black tongue of river.\
  \ We parted the waters in silence, broken only by the whirring of the motor. If\
  \ we strained with our city-deadened ears, we might catch the singing of far-off\
  \ frogs, the cicada's thrill and perhaps the lonely call of nightjar. Around us,\
  \ river, trees and sky brooded in different shades of the same dark.  \n\nI had\
  \ grown accustomed to darkness in the past year. Struggling to come to terms with\
  \ miscarriage, the loss of the love of my life and the death of a beloved grandfather\
  \ who had nurtured me through childhood, I had, like Khayyam's little children,\
  \ stumbled in the dark. I had sought escape in meditation, spiritual healing and\
  \ pilgrimages to shrines where others had been restored. Yet, when I arrived at\
  \ Endau Rompin National Park in the Malaysian state of Johor, I expected none of\
  \ this. I only sought to rest, here where the primeval forests blotted out the skies,\
  \ where if you were lucky or otherwise, you spotted _mawas_ , the Malay version\
  \ of the Yeti and where along the river, fireflies lit up the trees like Christmas\
  \ lights. \n\nDon't have any expectations, our guide had told us before we embarked\
  \ on the river in search of fireflies. If we see them, we see them. If not, we don't.\
  \ That suited me fine, weary as I had grown of hopes deferred and decayed. I sat\
  \ back, my heart empty and open to the darkness.\n\nThey appeared like a slow dawning,\
  \ rather than a revelation. Yet, there they were, suddenly all around us, their\
  \ silvery-purple light studding the trees, drifting on the water, looping in the\
  \ sky like dreams. \"Fireflies!\" someone whispered, then fell silent. The hush\
  \ that followed was as absolute, as charged as a held breath, a prayer. like a prayer,\
  \ they changed everything, river, forest and dome of sky into a magical otherworld\
  \ from which the veils that separated us were tremulous and very, very thin.\n\n\
  From the lit darkness above me, a lone firefly leapt. I lifted my hand, palm open,\
  \ not grasping. It landed on my fingertip, crawled on my palm and darted down my\
  \ arm, before darting off to become part of the light in the trees. I sat, hand\
  \ outstretched, yet no longer empty. For it had left behind a little of its brightness,\
  \ a kiss and a caress from the starry land just beyond the river.\n\n          \
  \                                                                              \
  \                         *   *   *\n\nI cannot say that I healed fully from the\
  \ losses, that the blackness that had engulfed me that year dissipated. Grief, like\
  \ the river, flows in uneven waves, sometimes soft, sometimes so overwhelming they\
  \ can drown. Like the river, it flows on until it reaches the forever sea. However\
  \ in moments of darkness and in light, I remember silhouetted trees hung with stars\
  \ and that one firefly, and think of all those I have loved and will love in the\
  \ future. You and only you shall shine for me, in my last ride downriver, like fireflies."
