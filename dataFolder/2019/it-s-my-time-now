Text: "I am a California native. Raised in Sacramento, I never had the opportunity\
  \ to leave and explore and I felt like my feet were constantly stuck in a tar pit.\
  \ I had just gone through some daunting life experiences; the ending of a 3 year\
  \ long relationship, financial hardship, a lack of value in my job, roommates abandoning\
  \ me (even though I paid more than half of their rent and food expenses, so my friend\
  \ could go to nursing school without having to work) and leaving me high and dry,\
  \ and having 5 days to find a place to live with no money, no plan, and it was Christmas.\
  \ I had hit Rock Bottom\u2122 and I hit it HARD. This is the point where a friend\
  \ from high school reached out to me with an opportunity for travel. She had studied\
  \ abroad in Italy more than once and has been trying to find a way to get back there\
  \ ever since. She showed me photos of places she's been, food she's tasted and coffee\
  \ she's enjoyed. I looked at her and shook my head, it looked AMAZING. But there\
  \ was no way I would be able to make the money to go. She grinned and said \"That\
  \ is where you are wrong, Caity.\" She pulled up the Au Pair website and signed\
  \ me up, and showed me how to fly to Italy for under $400. She filled me with more\
  \ hope than I'd had in the past month and a half, telling me that I have no tethers.\
  \ No lease, no boyfriend, and apparently, no real friends. It was time for me to\
  \ jump. Within 24 hours, I found a family to host me and I was shocked. I signed\
  \ a contract, put in my 2 weeks with my horrible job, and booked a plane ticket.\
  \ I was broke and I was scared to death. But even more so, I was thrilled. I left\
  \ for Italy on January 23rd and I haven't thought about looking back since. I arrived\
  \ in Italy a little more than 24 hours later, with a long 7 hour layover in Paris.\
  \ One month later, and I have made many friends internationally, I have been on\
  \ a hike by myself, gone to aperitivo, and had wine with Italians who are enamored\
  \ by an American accent. But the most important thing I have gained since being\
  \ here is more self confidence and self worth than I ever thought I could call my\
  \ own. In the US, I spent so much time doing for others, putting my heart out for\
  \ people who wouldn't look my way when I was drowning. I was on the hunt for love\
  \ and affection because I wasn't allowed to have it from myself. Here in Italy,\
  \ I spent the first month in what some people may feel is isolation. My dad would\
  \ ask me if I felt lonely with the language barrier, or if it was hard to adjust.\
  \ And it didn't take me long to think about the fact that even though I know barely\
  \ enough Italian to order my own coffee, I don't feel lonely or isolated. People\
  \ who don't speak Italian here still want to include me, and it fuels my fire to\
  \ learn and grow. I have experienced culture and laughter and happiness here. I\
  \ felt more isolation in a crowded room with my closest \"friends\" in the US than\
  \ I do sitting at a dinner table with my host family, speaking aggressive Italian\
  \ and hearing \"English only, please!\" from the father who knows only that phrase\
  \ in English. I love my life now, and I don't ever want to stop travelling and learning\
  \ and sharing with the world how one leap of faith can change your life, change\
  \ your perspective, and change the way you feel about yourself."
