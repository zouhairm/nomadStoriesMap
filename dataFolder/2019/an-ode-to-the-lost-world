Text: "Perhaps when Pachamama bestowed the world with her gifts, she reserved the\
  \ best for her beloved Bolivia. Adorned with the Andes and cradling the Amazon,\
  \ Bolivia has the world\u2019s most unique wonders.\n\nFew ever venture to the remote\
  \ Rurrenabaque by the River Beni, known as the \u2018Gateway to the Bolivian Amazon\u2019\
  .  Halfway through my trip, I decided to take an unplanned detour into the Amazon.\
  \ Having no flight options for the week, I opted for the bus that involved travelling\
  \ through the \u2018infamous\u2019 \u2018Death Road\u2019. It was a scary prospect\
  \ to travel on a one-way unpaved mountain road used for two-way traffic, with the\
  \ possibility of plunging into a deep ravine in case of a slight error.  With a\
  \ few warm words of assurances from the kind conductor, I was on my way.  Four hours\
  \ into the journey, with the sun having set in the Andes, I braved a look out the\
  \ window. And, there it was, just a few centimeters from me, the scariest plunge\
  \ of hundreds of feet while the rickety bus swayed slowly as it negotiated the curving\
  \ road. My heart must have skipped a few beats! Every few miles one could see the\
  \ small crosses along the road in memory of the unfortunate accident victims. I\
  \ guess five hours of such a road journey would make any person have the worst nightmares\
  \ for the rest of his life! \n\nRurre was warm, certainly a respite from the cold\
  \ of the Andes. The town, itself, didn\u2019t have much to offer, except for the\
  \ lines of operators offering tours to the Pampas in the Amazonian basin. Having\
  \ had recommendations from fellow backpackers in La Paz, I settled for Indigena\
  \ tours as they employed indigenous guides.\n\nThe next day, I teamed up with four\
  \ French backpackers and headed to meet our Aymara guide, Alejandro. An extremely\
  \ cheerful person, he was fascinated to meet an Indian for the first time in his\
  \ life. Being a huge fan of the \u2018Crocodile Hunter\u2019, Steve Irwin, I struck\
  \ up a conversation with Alejandro about the species of caimans and of course, the\
  \ mighty Anaconda inhabiting the jungle. Alejandro, with bit of a wry smile, mentioned:\
  \ \u201CSe\xF1or, Tengo un regalo esperandote\u201D (\u201CSir, I have a gift waiting\
  \ for you\u201D).\n\nWe began snaking along the Rio Beni to the cottage, on our\
  \ boat, marveling at the huge trees bowed down by parasitic growths on their mighty\
  \ bellies.  A few times we observed river tortoises basking in the sun while lazy\
  \ sloths hung on to the moss draped branches of the tallest trees. Thirty minutes\
  \ into our journey, Alejandro began slowing the boat down. Another boat load of\
  \ tourists had just disturbed a platoon of yellow monkeys. It reminded me of how\
  \ mass tourism is detrimental for the wildlife in such pristine areas. As we edged\
  \ closer to the platoon, one of the harried little guys jumped onto my bag and dug\
  \ out a banana from it. It was a hilarious sight to observe as he relished it in\
  \ peace on our boat, far from the boat load of noisy humans. While my companions\
  \ were busy clicking away their cameras, Alejandro gently tapped and drew my attention\
  \ towards the other side of the bank. Hidden in the swamp with just part of its\
  \ snout visible was a white caiman, waiting to hunt one of these monkeys for its\
  \ dinner. However, a long 45 minutes wait later, there was suddenly a loud howl.\
  \ A howler monkey had noticed the caiman and warned its cousins! The platoon immediately\
  \ scattered and climbed up to safety. It seemed like the caiman had to go hungry\
  \ that night and we had lost an opportunity to see it hunt.\n\nWe made our way to\
  \ the marshes to watch one of the most spectacular sunsets of our lives. The sun\
  \ setting over the Amazon painted the jungle red with its dying breath. The eerie\
  \ silence ruptured by the occasional sounds of the insects was palpable. Finally,\
  \ as reached our secluded cottage, Alejandro introduced me to my neighbor- a large\
  \ three metres caiman living in the adjacent creek. And thus, began a beautiful\
  \ friendship between me and the caiman for the next few days!"
