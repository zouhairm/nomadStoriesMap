Text: "I was making small talk. We\u2019d been through the basics \u2013 the weather,\
  \ where my three friends and I were from, how long we were travelling for \u2013\
  \ but there was still an hour left of the trip from the airport to Reykjavic with\
  \ our host, Siggi, who had picked us up.\n\nMy eyes kept being drawn out the window,\
  \ to the sun rising in pinks and oranges at 11am over the frosty landscape. The\
  \ sky had been black when Siggi picked us up at 10:30 that morning and would be\
  \ dark again by 3:30 that afternoon. \n\nI drew my attention back inside the warmth\
  \ of the car and to the man beside me. Grey hair, beaten leather jacket, smile lines\
  \ around his eyes. \u201CWhere\u2019s your favourite place that you\u2019ve travelled,\
  \ Siggi?\u201D I asked. The crunching of the studded tyres on the icy roads filled\
  \ the silence before he answered. \u201CI think your favourite place should be the\
  \ place where you are right now,\u201D he replied. I considered his statement and\
  \ smiled. For the next five days, Iceland had my heart.\n\nWe got home and Siggi\
  \ traced his fingers over the map he had stuck on the wall, creating thumb to forefinger\
  \ measurements. Four measurements \u2013 too far, he explained. \u201CIf you drive\
  \ this far, I cannot come save you,\u201D he chuckled. He pointed out on the map\
  \ the lighthouse which was the best place to see the Northern Lights. We saw them\
  \ our second night, flashes of green lighting up the starless sky. We shared the\
  \ moment with about 30 other people, but it didn\u2019t detract from the experience.\
  \ Instead we were all bathing in each other\u2019s delight; if the lights danced\
  \ across the sky, then our collective gasps and exclamations were the song.\n\n\
  He showed us where to go for natural hot springs, an hour hike up a mountain, a\
  \ quick strip off in the freezing temperatures, then testing the waters cautiously\
  \ with a toe like a too hot bath, but this was a bathtub with one hell of a view.\
  \ Before we set out that day, he checked the oil in the car he was lending us and\
  \ fussed about. \u201CYou let me know if you will be driving very far and back late,\
  \ so I do not worry,\u201D he said, an Icelandic accent lacing the English words.\
  \ \n\nOn our final morning, Siggi drove us through a cemetery, the graves and headstones\
  \ draped with fairy lights and crosses, lit up like beacons to guide the grieving.\
  \ It made me think, what would this place be without people? Without the people\
  \ there are no stories, no history, no love, no turmoil. Then there were the places\
  \ that exist regardless of humans to tell their stories, places that existed long\
  \ before us and will continue existing long after we are gone. A lake, frozen so\
  \ solid that rocks bounce off its surface, reflecting the sunrise and surrounded\
  \ by knee-length straw coloured grass. A waterfall, that soaks you as you walk around\
  \ its perimeter, but somehow you don\u2019t mind, despite the freezing temperatures.\
  \ A crater left by a volcano that erupts regardless of who is watching.\n\nAs we\
  \ drew near the airport, Siggi told us in no uncertain terms that if we visited\
  \ his country again, we would stay with him and we all assured him that of course\
  \ we would. I had one final question, even though we were beyond the small talk\
  \ now. \u201CSo,\u201D I led, turning to Siggi. \u201CI hear they eat horse here\
  \ in Iceland. How do they eat it?\u201D Horse steak, I pondered? Horse burger and\
  \ fries?  He slid his eyes off the road to glance at me sideways for a second, looking\
  \ rather pleased with himself. \u201CWe eat it with our mouths.\u201D"
