Text: "When my whimsy took me from browsing airfare to pressing \"send\" for direct,\
  \ economy tickets, I did not expect to find my family absorbing my life-long passion\
  \ of adventure. I surprised my husband and two teenage children with tickets to\
  \ Barcelona. A trip we had no business taking, financially; however, we earned for\
  \ a change of scenery and reprieve from a long, cold winter. Traveling light, we\
  \ took on the flamboyant city, scoring a great apartment in the perfect neighborhood\
  \ . . . close to it all but not amongst the hotels. \n\nHiking through Montserrat,\
  \ touching the robes of statues pointing the way to the next Saint, treasure, view,\
  \ and alcove filled me with joy. Pure. Complete. Joy. My kids, phones stashed away,\
  \ cameras in hand instead, eyes bouncing from monk to serrated rock to cathedral.\
  \ This was unexpected.\n\nGirona's narrow, cobbled roads led to lofty views from\
  \ ancient Roman walls. A remark from my daughter wondering how fantastic it would\
  \ be to attend college in such a place. The idea of studying abroad, another door\
  \ opening, a seed planted, without a nudging from me. \n\nCosta Brava's fresh, spring\
  \ rains inspired droplet photographs with the backdrop of the sea. Holding hands\
  \ with my husband while my son revealed that he is called to the ocean, the fog,\
  \ the damp earth that reminds him of something he cannot verbalize. It's a \"feeling\"\
  \ deep inside that tells me this is where I belong. And I thought he wanted to snowboard.\
  \ . . . \n\nYes, I will continue to be impulsive with my airfare urges. I will never\
  \ regret the gifts of hitting the road, together, my family, to unearth the musings\
  \ of my teens hidden thoughts. I knew we would enjoy our escape. The new possibilities\
  \ of adventurous pathways for my teens was a pleasant surprise."
