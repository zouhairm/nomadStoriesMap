Text: "\u201CWelcome\u201D \u2014 a Couchsurfing invitation I\u2019ve got from Henrique,\
  \ a guy from Rio de Janeiro, was pretty concise. I look at his profile and find\
  \ out he lives in a favela. \u201DA place where many poor people live\u201D, as\
  \ he describes. Henrique\u2019s profile has very few negative references. One guy\
  \ was complaining that he was unexpectedly refused to be hosted. Henrique explained\
  \ there was a police operation in the favela, and he had to decline request because\
  \ of safety issues. Though all other \u2014 dozens! \u2014 references were positive\
  \ and full of admired descriptions of Henrique and his neighborhood. \u201CThank\
  \ you\u201D, \u2014 I respond and press \u201CConfirm\u201D button.\n\nAfter my\
  \ bus left the RIo\u2019s downtown, it has been stopped on an army checkpoint. One\
  \ of two fully equipped soldiers enters inside. He sees a group of local teenagers\
  \ on a back seat and frisks them looking for weapons. Having found nothing he leaves\
  \ the bus and lets the driver go further.\n\nRio favelas are well-known as places\
  \ inhabited by gangsters, where you can quickly lose your health and belongings.\
  \ It\u2019s partly true. Also it\u2019s true that most of their residents are poor.\
  \ And most of favelas are not controlled by government. Instead of police patrols\
  \ on streets you\u2019ll see local gangs\u2019 members with automatic weapons.\n\
  \nBefore hosting the 2014 football World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympic Brazilian\
  \ government decided to clean up the mess. At least in favelas of Rio\u2019s downtown.\
  \ Police came into those areas to fight against gangs. The operations were looking\
  \ more like a little war: with heavy weapons, armored vehicles and helicopters.\
  \ But they had an effect: a few favelas came under the governmental control and\
  \ later turned into popular touristic sights with bars, clubs and hotels. Though\
  \ a lot of similar neighborhoods remain under gangs\u2019 control.\n\nI get off\
  \ the bus on the stop, Henrique has told me, but can\u2019t find the right building.\
  \ A local guy comes to me and starts mumbling something. His eyes are absolutely\
  \ empty, snot is hanging from his nose and his speech is so slurred, I would hardly\
  \ understand it even if I spoke Portuguese. I try to explain I don\u2019t understand\
  \ him at all, but all I get in response is another portion of incoherently babbling.\
  \ Favelas in Rio are centers of drug trade, so drug consumers always wander around\
  \ their outskirts. And meeting such people becomes a welcoming custom for me every\
  \ time I return to Henrique\u2019s place.\n\nI leave the junkie and ask another\
  \ local about Henrique. I immediately get help and is led to the door of his home.\
  \ It\u2019s the first favela\u2019s feature I\u2019ve learned from my staying there.\
  \ Local residents are cohesive enough. It\u2019s a society where everyone knows\
  \ everyone. And while I am walking with Henrique along the streets he greets dozens\
  \ of people.\n\nAside from lunatic junkies at the favela\u2019s edges I wouldn\u2019\
  t say I\u2019ve felt any danger. Even considering local guys with rifles patrolling\
  \ the streets and drugs, which are being sold on street stalls like apples in your\
  \ local market. \nA few weeks before my trip I\u2019ve read an article about tourists\
  \ who were travelling around Afghanistan using Couchsurfing and have found themselves\
  \ being hosted by former and active Taliban members. While reading I\u2019ve joked\
  \ to myself that it\u2019s actually one of the Couchsurfing\u2019s goals \u2014\
  \ learning more about others\u2019 lives and cultural immersion. But sometimes this\
  \ process takes a really unusual form.\n\nApart from famous sites while my trips\
  \ I always try to visit some residential areas, even if they don\u2019t look good\
  \ enough. It can be ethically ambiguous, but it\u2019s just another manifestation\
  \ of our world, which shouldn't be avoided. Mumbai slums Dharavi which hosts up\
  \ to 1 million people has more connection with real life of the city than the famous\
  \ Gateway of India and other colonial buildings. And Nairobi slums Kibera will tell\
  \ you more about current Kenya\u2019s state than all the national parks and reserves.\
  \ So if you want to know more about local life you can\u2019t ignore its unpleasant\
  \ parts."
