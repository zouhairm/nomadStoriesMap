Text: "As we know better Afghanistan is a land lock country and living in Afghanistan\
  \ is too hard. from the other side the security condition is not good in Afghanistan\
  \ even in the capital. and as whole the world know about Afghanistan its a country\
  \ where many Taliban live and it cause the situation and condition worse in Afghanistan.\n\
  \  Temperatures in the central highlands are below freezing for most of the winter,\
  \ and snow is common at higher elevations. Summertime highs in lower elevations\
  \ (such as Jalalabad or Mazar-e Sharif) can exceed 50\xB0C/120\xB0F. In higher areas\
  \ such as Kabul, summer temperatures can be 30\xB0C/90\xB0F and winter around 0\xB0\
  C/30\xB0F. The most pleasant weather in Kabul is during April, May and September.\n\
  Afghanistan is an ethnically diverse country. Tribal and local allegiances are strong,\
  \ which complicates national politics immensely.\n\nThe largest ethnic group is\
  \ the Pashtun followed by the Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek and others.\n\nBaloch tribesmen,\
  \ while still largely nomadic, can be found anywhere between Quetta in Pakistan\
  \ and Mashhad in Iran, including much of Western Afghanistan. They make marvellous\
  \ rugs, if somewhat simple.\n\nThere are about three thousand Hindus and Sikhs living\
  \ in different cities of the country but mostly in Kabul, Jalalabad, and Kandahar\
  \ who belong to the Punjabi, Sindhi, Kabuli, and Kandhari ethnic groups.\n\nHazaras\
  \ in the Central mountains look much more Asiatic than other Afghans. According\
  \ to some theories, many of them are descended from Ghengis Khan's soldiers.\n\n\
  Afghanistan is a multilingual country in which two languages - Persian (Dari) and\
  \ Pashto are both official with Persian being most widely spoken in the country.\
  \ Pashto speakers predominate in the South and East, Persian in North, West and\
  \ central Afghanistan. About 11% of the population have Turkic languages, Uzbek\
  \ or Turkmen, as their first language. Many of them are in the North, near Uzbekistan\
  \ and Turkmenistan. Minor native language groups include Nuristani, Dardic and Pamiri,\
  \ found in small pockets in the east and northeast.Most ethnicities speak and understand\
  \ Persian.\nLanguages:Pashto and Dari, an Afghan dialect of Persian, are both the\
  \ official languages of Afghanistan. Most Afghans are able to speak in Dari and\
  \ Pashto. The latest CIA country profile mentions that Dari is spoken by about 50%,\
  \ mainly in the Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e Sharif and Central Afghanistan regions. Pashto\
  \ is spoken mainly in the South and East; it is also spoken in neighbouring Pakistan.\
  \ The remaining are Turkic native language, primarily Uzbek and Turkmen, and there\
  \ are also 30 minor languages such as Balochi. English is now at the climax of its\
  \ flourishing in Afghanistan and the percentage of those who speak English now has\
  \ reached unprecedented rates. President Karzai, his cabinet and many others are\
  \ fluent in English. The English language was taught at past from the 7th grade,\
  \ but now is taught from the fourth grade and signs in English in the streets are\
  \ becoming common now all over the country. English is the second foreign language\
  \ in Afghanistan. Quite a lot of people also speak basic Urdu/Hindi due to the fact\
  \ that millions of Afghans lived in refugee camps in Pakistan and the popularity\
  \ of Bollywood in this country.\n\nsincerely subhan mirzakhil."
