Text: "I\u2019ve often wondered what it would be like to visit a town or a country\
  \ after it has been devastated by war. What would it sound like? What would it smell\
  \ like? Who would be left? I\u2019ve had images in my mind of emaciated people standing\
  \ in door frames watching me as I make my way down the street \u2013 just another\
  \ tourist in a long line of tourists wondering about the cruel realities of war.\n\
  \nIt was these wonderings that tailgated me as I made my way through Japan, from\
  \ Tokyo to Osaka, then on to Hiroshima. As a Westerner, I was all too familiar with\
  \ the stories from World War II, of the battles fought \u2013 those that were lost,\
  \ and those that were won. But it was always the tales of the Western forces that\
  \ I\u2019d learnt and read about, it was never those of our enemies, especially\
  \ the Japanese. Before I visited Hiroshima, the only thing I knew about the city\
  \ could be described by two words. Atomic Bomb. All I previously knew about Hiroshima\
  \ was that the Americans had devastated it by dropping the world\u2019s first atomic\
  \ bomb on it on August 6, 1945.\n\nThe blast from the atomic bomb almost immediately\
  \ claimed the lives of 80,000 nationals, with another 60,000 reported dead by year\u2019\
  s end from the bomb\u2019s radioactive fallout. A total of 140,000 lives lost in\
  \ just a matter of months. Stepping off the bullet train, I found myself taking\
  \ in the busy and bustling city of Hiroshima. Even though World War II had devastated\
  \ the world some 70 years earlier, I guess with these figures in mind I was expecting\
  \ to find myself in some sort of ghost town. A town where the memories were too\
  \ painful for people to live alongside them. \n\nHowever, with the ghostly exception\
  \ of the A-bomb dome, you could be excused for thinking you were in a different\
  \ city. A different city, with a different history perhaps. But that is what makes\
  \ Hiroshima such a must-see destination. It should be at the top of your \u2018\
  Must go to\u2019 places in Japan, if for nothing else other than to bear witness\
  \ to one country\u2019s resilience to re-build. \n\nWith a head full of war history\
  \ and a hunger to learn more about one of the greatest tragedies in the world\u2019\
  s history, I spent a day wandering around the A-bomb dome and the Hiroshima Peace\
  \ Memorial museum. Let\u2019s face it, each country has an agenda in war. There\
  \ are lands and resources to be claimed, people to take advantage of, and new alliances\
  \ to be made. War can make the most humble of men into the most terrifying of monsters,\
  \ it can harden a country\u2019s resolve and turn neighbour against neighbour. But\
  \ this is where Japan differs.\n\nNever before did I expect to witness such an honest\
  \ account about a country\u2019s role in such a devastating war. But that is exactly\
  \ what is on display in the Hiroshima War memorial. Japan does not shy away from\
  \ their role in the war, nor do they deny any involvement in causing devastation\
  \ across the globe, especially in Pearl Harbour. The Japanese know exactly why they\
  \ were targeted, and now, they are asking for forgiveness. The first-hand accounts\
  \ from children who lost parents, from parents who lost children and people who\
  \ lost their whole family are incredibly heart breaking. The Hiroshima War Memorial\
  \ is full of stories like these. The visit is overwhelming and heartbreaking, but\
  \ it\u2019s an important reminder for the maintenance of peace, especially in this\
  \ current global crisis.\n\nThe Japanese are honest and up-front in their accounts\
  \ of the war, and now they push their agenda of peace. As you leave the Memorial\
  \ Museum you are surrounded by messages of peace and the need to not repeat the\
  \ mistakes of the past. Japan has rebuilt what is arguably one of the most torn-apart\
  \ cities in history, but the message they spread? It\u2019s not one of hate, it\u2019\
  s one of peace and hope, one of a safer and more secure future. And I think there\u2019\
  s a lot we can learn from that."
