Text: "The small village of Sacromonte looked as if it was an Andalusian Hobbiton.\
  \ Tiny homes and businesses sprung from the hillside, decorated with flower pots\
  \ and textiles. Aloe vera the size of cars sprouted up from between them. Lone alleycats\
  \ swaggered into thickets of unkempt shrubbery. We scooted along the streets as\
  \ cars sped past us, navigating steep switchbacks. \n\nI stepped through a doorway\
  \ into a dark tienda, a small convenient store, carved from the limestone cliffs.\
  \ Southern Spain\u2019s characteristic white washed walls surrounded us, as they\
  \ are wont to do in this part of the world. Dust filtered through beams of sunlight\
  \ as our eyes adjusted and I began methodically scanning for wine. \n\nShelves had\
  \ been carved from the same stone as the walls, housing common food staples and\
  \ toiletries. It looked as though the cave was abandoned. The wares left to the\
  \ mice. But before we knew it a smiling face appeared from a recess in an adjacent\
  \ wall. \u201CCan I help you?\u201D, he inquired as he wiped limestone speckles\
  \ from the counter, falling like snow from above.\n\n\u201CUm\u2026\u201D I looked\
  \ at my husband, embarrassed to fail at speaking Spanish again. Through all my travels\
  \ I had always hoped to fain an air of belonging but more often than not my appearance\
  \ and undeniable stumbling of words quickly gave way. \u201CVino tinto?\u201D I\
  \ inquired sheepishly. The shopkeeper pointed a finger in the air with a look of\
  \ glee and disappeared into the shadows.\n\nA few moments later he returned with\
  \ a bottle of Rioja, dusting it off and proudly presenting it. He gestured towards\
  \ the refrigerator behind us and said, \u2018You put it in there for\u2026\u2019\
  \ as he held up ten fingers. \u2018Then\u2026\u2019, he pointed to his nose and\
  \ made an upward swooshing motion with his hands as if to suggest a deep inhale.\
  \ His signature smile cracked from between his lips, revealing teeth that had been\
  \ tinged by an indulgence that we knowingly shared. \n\n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\
  \ he looked inquisitively between us. I grasped for the words, panicking in the\
  \ moment, \u201CEstados Unidos?\u201D. It was more of a question that an answer\
  \ and I could already feel the pang of remorse welling up inside my throat. A look\
  \ of recognition crossed his face, \u201CI studied English in the United Kingdom,\
  \ I know how it feels to learn a new language.\u201D He winked and I felt myself\
  \ blush. \n\nAs we turned to leave he ran a calloused hand along the alabaster walls,\
  \ \u2018These caves are painted every year. I think this one is overdue.\u201D White\
  \ pebbles rolled between his fingertips until they turned to dust. \n\nWe walked\
  \ up the stone steps toward home, our precious treasure tucked in my arm. As the\
  \ last of the light sank below the rolling foot hills of the Sierra Nevada mountains\
  \ I felt as if we were becoming a part of the quiet quotidian of Sacromonte. I relished\
  \ in the thought that we could belong so easily in a place, and wondered what it\
  \ took to feel as though you were truly a part of a community. Something that had\
  \ eluded me in other parts of the world.\n\nWas it the nature of this neighborhood,\
  \ once ignored due to the flamboyant Gitano\u2019s who dwelled in its caves? Maybe\
  \ it was easier to feel at home in a place that had been all but cast aside. Or\
  \ perhaps the sense of belonging was a culmination of small acts. Acts of kindness\
  \ and conversation. Eye contact shared by complete strangers. The warmth of laughter.\
  \ A shared love of vino tinto. It didn\u2019t matter if we spoke the same language,\
  \ where we grew up, what jobs we had. It mattered that by some miracle, we were\
  \ in the same place at the same time, enjoying the company of one another, and simply\
  \ sharing space."
