Text: "How the fear of the unknown helped a strategist to embrace spontaneity and\
  \ brought an introvert to share her life stories with complete strangers.\n\nAfter\
  \ seven years working for the same company, I was let go. That was not part of the\
  \ plan. My meticulous personality had everything lined up: study French, apply for\
  \ my Canadian permanent residency, save more money and then quit... but getting\
  \ fired was the best thing that could have happened to me. Would I have been brave\
  \ enough to quit and leave my security as I knew it?\n\nMy first day at home was\
  \ scary. I was not sure I would be able to achieve my goals and that sudden fear\
  \ of the unknown froze my senses, but also made me realize that I was now free to\
  \ pursuit my dream: traveling the world. A second plan was born. \n\nWhen I booked\
  \ my one-way ticket to Portugal about two months later, I had no idea that I was\
  \ never going back to Brazil. The idea was to leave on a sabbatical for eight months\
  \ and go right back to find another job. After a year I was organizing a trip to\
  \ New Zealand on a campervan.\n\nOne of my long-life dreams was to cook canned beans\
  \ over a campfire, just like they do on those western movies \u2013 weird, I know.\
  \ Never thought that day would actually come, and the beans would be sweet, chewy\
  \ and flavourless, and that was the moment that changed everything. The moment that\
  \ revealed a deeper understanding that everything is possible.\n\nReality strikes\
  \ constantly and we usually come up with lots of reasons (or excuses?) not to follow\
  \ the path to what we consider liberating. We keep on working at jobs we dislike,\
  \ procrastinating holidays, stressing over our finances, struggling with lack of\
  \ time to do everything in life, but never taking that step to take us out of the\
  \ cycle. Eventually years go by before we realize we missed an opportunity and by\
  \ that time another reasoning invade our thoughts: I\u2019m too old now. Nonsense!\
  \ I am 41 years old and having a blast.\n\nLife can be complicated, but small steps\
  \ are key.\n\nOn the road we meet many faces that are there for different reasons:\
  \ vacation, discovery, soul-searching, self-reflection or just to get away. They\
  \ all have amazing stories to tell and a better understanding of our own selves\
  \ is the ultimate result of those encounters. \n\nMy favorite concept of visiting\
  \ other cultures is the immersion in a whole new lifestyle, many times much different\
  \ than the one we know back home. The world is filled with people sharing the most\
  \ spectacular stories and traditions and all those experiences add to the person\
  \ we become when we travel.\n\nThe story was not about a place anymore, but about\
  \ all places and all people.\n\nStaying in one city for more than a couple of weeks\
  \ was exhilarating. The feeling of living the local life, shopping at the corner\
  \ store, knowing which bakery had the best cinnamon buns or the times for the live\
  \ music at the local pub brought me the feeling of my wish being fulfilled.\n\n\
  Memories imprinted with the smell of saffron in Barcelona, the taste of pisco in\
  \ Cusco, the songs played on the streets of Galway, the colors of Mexico and the\
  \ extraordinary sigh the Iguazu Falls often make me want to go back.\n\nResort vacations\
  \ are incredibly comfortable and relaxing, but nothing says authenticity more than\
  \ exploring your destination.\n\nOne year of traveling turned into two years, that\
  \ turned into a new job in Canada \u2013 the place that I had my heart set on. \n\
  \nLittle did I know that Canada would come with a bit of a cultural shock.  Not\
  \ only adapting to a different social environment, but also being from a tropical\
  \ climate surely presented its challenges. The solution of finding shelter in sunny\
  \ places during the harsh Canadian winters was inevitable, which is the perfect\
  \ excuse to keep on traveling.\n\nThe outstanding benefits of taking the steps towards\
  \ the life you want to live are endless, from satisfaction to simply the calm sense\
  \ of self."
