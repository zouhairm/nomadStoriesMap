Text: "It's a cold night, and the dirt covering the uneven streets is mingling with\
  \ the water making everything slick and dark.  \n\nA small congregation has crowded\
  \ towards the far side of the church, where the rain can't soak them.  The priests`cathedral\
  \ aspirations overshot the budget and the capability of the builders, leaving one\
  \ side of the massive space uncovered and three out of four walls insufficient in\
  \ blocking out the wind.  Everyone crushes closer together, I smile at those surrounding\
  \ me and pretend I am comfortable.\n\nThe lights aren't working for the first while,\
  \ so we rely on candles and the streetlights.  I like the glow they cast on the\
  \ white-robed altar boys and the red brick walls.\n\nThe service starts, and I watch\
  \ the lightning to the tune of melodic spanish prayers to Santa Marta and Madre\
  \ Maria.  The rain pours down the columns and pools on the floor.  The priest holds\
  \ steadfast against the sudden shocks of intense thunder, and his congregation follows\
  \ suit.  An elderly woman nudges me out of my daze, and I let her wobble past me\
  \ to the line-up for communion.  I slump low in my seat and tell myself I'll partake\
  \ someday, when it feels right.\n\nAs the group files out of the church, I seek\
  \ out the Sister to go home.  Two children in matching red school uniforms are speaking\
  \ to her under her polka-dot umbrella.  I hold back in the shadows to avoid more\
  \ awkward introductions, but she sees me and beckons me over. \n\n\u201CWe are going\
  \ for a little visit\u2013 they have recently moved and would like me to see where,\u201D\
  \ she says with a smile, \u201CAnd maybe there will be a little snack.\u201D\n\n\
  Up the muddy hills we went, past the shopkeepers just locking up, tip-toeing around\
  \ the rivulets of dirty water pouring down the streets.  Past the lights of the\
  \ hole-in-the-wall bars where people gathered around television sets, there were\
  \ long winding rows of corrugated aluminum shacks.  The older sister of the pair\
  \ guided us down a narrow path around the side of her home; there was no light there,\
  \ but I managed to step and not stumble over the rocks and puddles and glinting\
  \ glass. \n\nThey led us inside a tiny room with a bed, a desk covered in school\
  \ books, a small table, and two chairs, which were set out for the Sister and I.\
  \  There was an even smaller room in the back where the kitchen and bathtub were.\
  \  Mismatched sheets had been hung on the wall to cover the aluminum.  My hair dripped\
  \ on the cement floor, but I was too distracted by the intense sound of the rain\
  \ falling on the roof.  The siblings handed us towels, and the Sister told me their\
  \ ages, where they went to school, all the usual things. They nodded, and began\
  \ to tell her about what they were studying while serving us hot chocolate and thick,\
  \ bready pastries.  I wasn`t hungry, but I focused on finishing it all.  It would\
  \ feel like a crime, I think, if I didn`t.  I wondered at how the family managed\
  \ to fit a mother, teenage girl, and young boy in that single-sized bed until the\
  \ Sister announced that it was time to go.\n\nWe said our goodbyes, and the girl\
  \ walked with the Sister arm in arm back to the main room, while I stumbled along\
  \ behind, regretting not wearing a rain coat.  It was still pouring when we went\
  \ to bed that night.\n\nThe Sister once told me about young woman who joined the\
  \ religious community because she so intensely wanted to see Brazil.  She had not\
  \ yet said her final vows when she was finally sent to a barrio near Sao Paulo.\
  \  Within the first bus ride through the poor and dirty neighborhoods of South America,\
  \ she became traumatized.  The other Sisters of the area tried to comfort and console\
  \ her, but her intense fear led her to the arms of an Italian man she met in language\
  \ school, and she quit the Order to go to Italy. \n\n\u201CWhat was she expecting?\u201D\
  , we both wondered aloud and shook our heads.\n\nSometimes, though, I wonder what\
  \ I was expecting."
