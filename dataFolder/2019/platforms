Text: "\u2026trains arriving, trains departing. People coming, going. From someplace,\
  \ somewhere. Small crowd in front of the train schedule board. Chatting away, whilst\
  \ throwing short glances at the board, the letters on the display screen frantically\
  \ flipping, rolling, changing. Now? Not yet. Still no go. Delay. Ten minutes, twenty\u2026\
  \ They\u2019re excited, impatient. Some of them sit on their luggage, on their suitcases.\
  \ Or on the ground. The younger ones take out their foam mattresses and sleeping\
  \ bags, tuck themselves in and have their pre-journey nap. With their foldable bikes\
  \ or skateboards on the side. They\u2019re not ready to go yet.\n\nBehind the crowd,\
  \ an elderly couple, clutching each others\u2019 hands. The man is wearing a dark\
  \ brown hat, and thick rimmed glasses.  A knee length, slightly worn jacket on the\
  \ woman. Mint coloured scarf. Occasional breeze from the tracks. \n\nOut back, behind\
  \ the snack bars, tip-topping pigeons. A large black and white one dancing around\
  \ three smaller grey pigeons. Without any success. The others are preoccupied with\
  \ filling their beaks.\n\nAll those times spent on platforms. Watching people. Especially\
  \ their faces. They tell stories of excited anticipation, the pleasure of seeing\
  \ each other again.\n\nI plunge into the crowd. I\u2019m going with the flow. Crowdsurfing.\
  \ Drifting. I\u2019m going wherever others are going. As if I would have a purpose.\
  \ People bump into me. Some will avoid me. Some apologise, take no notice or swear\
  \ at me in their own colourful language. \n\nAt times, I stand alone. I move aside.\
  \ Next to the wall, in the alcove. Almost unnoticed. Bit like watching wildlife\
  \ in the hide. Playing a guessing game: who, where, why. \n\nNew information on\
  \ screen. The crowd starts moving. Faces of relief. Finally! Ladies and gentlemen,\
  \ the train to XYZ is about to depart from platform 2\u2026 Entire harmony. Everyone\
  \ reaches for their bags, sacks, and everyone starts moving...in unison. In the\
  \ same direction.\n\nThe old couple stays. They\u2019re waiting. Turning their backs\
  \ to the board of schedules. Behind them empty spaces. They are the only ones remaining.\
  \ With their thick rimmed glasses and mint coloured scarves.\n\nI walk closer to\
  \ them. They do not notice. I explore the features of the man, then I look at the\
  \ woman. \n\nThe flapping of wings. Black and white flash. I perceive it from the\
  \ corner of my eyes, but not taking my eyes off the elderly couple. I do not want\
  \ to miss the moment. The moment of encounter. It is the best! Those glittering\
  \ eyes, that cloudless smile. The movement of an embrace. Laughter, that soars in\
  \ the sky with the pigeons\u2026The train arrives.\n\nThe old man hugs his wife.\
  \  Call me when you get there\u2026 I\u2019ll be fine\u2026 Send my regards to\u2026\
  \n\nThe clattering of wheels. Faster and faster. A young woman is running alongside\
  \ the train. Waving her hands, blowing kisses. From the half open window a boy of\
  \ the same age waves back and smiles, throws some kisses back to her lover. The\
  \ girl is laughing, and pretending to catch it. The train is getting away at full\
  \ speed. The girl doesn\u2019t follow. It is the end of the platform. She stops\
  \ and turns around. Her mouth preserves her laughter for a while, but her posture\
  \ is sad. \n\nAnother group arrives. Their noise fills the station. \n\nI haste\
  \ towards some hiding place. Keep a low profile! If they notice, if they realise\
  \ the fun is over! It is very comfy here at the station. Watching arrivals, departures.\
  \ Those looks. The embraces. I memorise everything that goes on around me. \n\n\
  I like those lights. The lights of happiness. And of sadness. Sadness has it\u2019\
  s own lights too. And pain. The pain of loss will light trough their eyes, and in\
  \ their wrinkles. \n\nIt feels good to experience this day after day\u2026 and to\
  \ recall every little detail, the colours, scents and sounds. What I\u2019ve seen\
  \ in the past I would evoke with accuracy and precision. I remember the atmosphere.\
  \ And I can immerse in those memories for hours. Putting myself into the crowd.\
  \ At the station. No outside world, no world of pain. No emptiness. Only a space\
  \ formed by imagination infused by the warmth of belonging to someone..."
