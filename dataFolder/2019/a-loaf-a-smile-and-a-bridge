Text: "A loaf of bread.  That\u2019s what she\u2019d asked for.  The old Hungarian\
  \ woman standing across from me, no more than shoulder height, had tapped me on\
  \ the side and beckoned me to follow.  I was in a grocery store in Budapest casually\
  \ browsing the food on offer, my olfactory receptors heightened and attentive to\
  \ the possible culinary delights I would discover.  Before I could utter a single\
  \ word she\u2019d already spun around and begun walking away, glancing backwards,\
  \ checking I wasn\u2019t far behind.  I followed her down the aisle where she stopped\
  \ purposefully and turned towards me.  \n\n\u201CUh, hi...\u201D I spoke, a questioning\
  \ look upon my face, my curiosity piqued.    \nShe smiled warmly, tiny wrinkles\
  \ appearing around the corners of her eyes, and looking upwards she pointed to something\
  \ far beyond her reach.  I paused for a brief moment, taking in her appearance.\
  \  Her small, frail hands, slightly hunched back, and wisps of grey-white hair appearing\
  \ from beneath a darkly woven headscarf, were indicative of many decades gone by.\
  \  Her eyes, which bore a deep hazel hue, seemed to exude intelligence and gave\
  \ the impression of someone still very much acutely aware of the world around them.\n\
  \nRealising she couldn\u2019t speak English we exchanged a friendly succession of\
  \ nods, hand gestures, and smiles, until her fingers finally grasped what I\u2019\
  d effortlessly removed from the top shelf...yes, a loaf of bread.  With the item\
  \ in hand she looked at me intensely, smiled, and somewhat bowed.  I was thoroughly\
  \ taken aback by such a gracious display of gratitude, and for such a simple gesture\
  \ on my part, that all I could think of doing was to smile and bow in return.  She\
  \ spun around once more, and left.  I stood there dumbfounded in the middle of the\
  \ aisle, gazing after her short figure until it disappeared around a crate of carefully\
  \ stacked goods.  \n\nAs I sat over a warm, hearty bowl of spiced goulash, my thoughts\
  \ brought me back to the old woman.  The brief encounter had felt incredibly uplifting,\
  \ and I wondered about her.  What kind of life did she lead? Is she used to seeing\
  \ foreigners? Is that why she felt comfortable \u2018asking\u2019 me for help? Does\
  \ she have friends just as accepting as her? What does she do for a living? Does\
  \ she live alone? Does she have children? Are they nearby or have they left to explore\
  \ other cultures? Is she lonely? Is she happy? As my pensive mood continued I was\
  \ overcome with a great sense of comfort, and with the heavenly aroma of my recently\
  \ devoured stew still lingering by, I was content."
