Text: "I arrived in Edinburgh, Scotland around 7am after taking the sleeper train\
  \ from London. I was planning on only staying in Scotland for 2 days before continuing\
  \ onto Germany. I ended up extending my trip by another day because at the end of\
  \ the trip, I just wasn't ready to leave yet. \n\nWhen I arrived at the Edinburgh\
  \ train station, the sun was just beginning to rise and it seemed to illuminate\
  \ all the Gothic stone buildings as I passed them in the cab. By the time I arrived\
  \ at my hostel, I felt like I was in another time period entirely as I got to watch\
  \ the sun rise fiery red over Edinburgh castle. \n\nI dumped my stuff and was back\
  \ out the door within 10 minutes, anxious to explore as much as I could, drinking\
  \ it in, and trying to capture every nook and cranny on my  professional camera.\
  \ It still feels like a dream now when I think of that day, like a place that beautiful\
  \ couldn't possibly exist in the real world.\n\nI hopped on the \"Wee Red Bus\"\
  \ with my family and began my tour of the Scottish highlands, starting with Sterling\
  \ Castle. You can feel the history that's sunken into the marshy earth from centuries\
  \ of battles and stories. It was misting outside and honestly, I wouldn't have it\
  \ any other way for touring a medieval castle. You look around, and are instantly\
  \ transported to the set of Game of Thrones or Monty Python. (In fact, we did visit\
  \ another castle where both were filmed)\n\nWe made our way up to Long Loch, our\
  \ tour guide pointed to a path up a steep hill and we followed. By the time we reached\
  \ the top, I had a thought that maybe this is what heaven looks like. Across a long\
  \ stretch of the Loch you could see the rolling highland foothills, and they seemed\
  \ to stretch on and on until my eyes could not see anything farther. There were\
  \ wildflowers, crisp leaves falling, and puffy sheep roaming in every direction.\
  \ Before we left, I took a picture with my husband to commemorate our 2nd anniversary;\
  \ we stood under a grouping of trees that curved perfectly into an arch that resembled\
  \ our wedding day Huppah. \n\nAfter a hearty lunch in a quaint little town, we moved\
  \ on to the last destination of our journey, an authentic Scottish distillery.\n\
  Now, usually brown liquor triggers my gag reflex, but funny thing, I realized that\
  \ this is how it's SUPPOSED to taste! We sipped scotch that was older than my brother\
  \ as we watched the sheep playing on the mountaintop.\n\nOn the way back into Edinburgh;\
  \ I don't know if it was the Scottish folk songs playing, the beautiful scenery,\
  \ my family sleeping all around me, or the warm scotch in my belly, but I had the\
  \ sudden need to write about it. I haven't written poetry in years but I was suddenly\
  \ moved to do so, and now that same poem is being considered for publication in\
  \ a British magazine.\n\nBy the time I got back to Edinburgh, I got the privilege\
  \ of watching the sun set over the Gothic buildings with the same fiery red hue\
  \ as that morning."
