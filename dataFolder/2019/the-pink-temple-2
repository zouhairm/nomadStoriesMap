Text: "When my family decided to leave Angkor Wat, it seemed like a little too early\
  \ for me. Tok-la, our temple guide, had mentioned nearly everything about the ancient\
  \ Khmer civilization, then I understand how both my parents and brother could enjoy\
  \ a little variety. But with those trillion stories about evil emperors and wise\
  \ monks he also mentioned some more distant, mysterious temples in the outsides\
  \ of the region... Apparently, the figures depicted in the walls were of great beauty\
  \ and meaning, with the power to transform those who would travel to see them. \n\
  \nThere was no doubt I wanted to go, both for the sense of being on my own in Cambodia\
  \ for a few days and to get the chance to see the pink temple. \nThe negotiation\
  \ wasn\u2019t complicated. It was pretty clear that the members of my family were\
  \ all starting to get sick of each other. And I don\u2019t mean this in a heartbreaking\
  \ way, but just the expected discomfort came from some intense 10 days traveling\
  \ from London to Vietnam and Cambodia. Because the last days had been well fed on\
  \ culture and misery (Cambodia is a really poor country with many social problems.you\
  \ can easily feel that going out-of-path from the Angkor Wat route...) my parents\
  \ and brother were ready to fly away to promising Thailand. \nBruno just wanted\
  \ to go to the beach - you know, the beach from the beach, the Leo Di Carpio iconic\
  \ movie! - and my parents biggest aspirations were to land a hotel room with a washing\
  \ machine and do some shopping. This news came as a balsam for me, there wasn\u2019\
  t a lot of a shock when I claimed I wanted to stay in Siem Reap for a few more days\
  \ in order to go to that pink temple thing. \n\nMy parents understood easily- I\
  \ was also a complete nerd about art history, I still am - and offered that I keep\
  \ Tok-la, our beloved temple guide, to visit the distant temples. I think he was\
  \ present when we mentioned it, he agreed automatically, after all, he was trying\
  \ to market his product. I remember not being shocked or disturbed either with the\
  \ suggestion, I had the feeling of being a lil\u2019 spoiled princess and getting\
  \ away with my desires. I knew a time for my own was coming..."
