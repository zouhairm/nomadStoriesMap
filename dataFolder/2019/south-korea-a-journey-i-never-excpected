Text: "For someone that\u2019ll spend two years away from home like across another\
  \ separate country, i kind of reckless with only packing half of my suitcase for\
  \ 40 kilo\u2019s baggage allowance. \nI have always thought it is just for a while\
  \ and i was only 1 day away from home like how i used to when i had my bachelor\
  \ degree.\nSouth Korea has never been a country that i dream to live or taking my\
  \ school, But here i am in my third years of stay in a country that strangely opposite\
  \ but similar in any ways like how the people still taking serious matter about\
  \ how they addressing someone much older and how to behave towards others. \nThis\
  \ city I've stayed, Seoul bring me to jump of new experience and especially a leap\
  \ of spiritual not i even imagine while I'm in my own country Indonesia that is\
  \ majority Muslim.\nIt is hard for me to take my praying when I\u2019m outside of\
  \ my place of stay. No masjid around to look for and it\u2019s even hard to find\
  \ edible food to consume. I need to keep on reading thoroughly what the ingredients\
  \ were and keep on researching myself about what is forbidden and not and also made\
  \ me learn how to deal with food that already serving, but you cannot eat it. It\
  \ is teaching me that during a hard time, we need to learn to adjust rather than\
  \ complaining and crying. And traveling itself made us a stronger person after we\
  \ return from our trip.\nAt first, it was like \u2018hell\u2019 for me and actually\
  \ i still wondering what am i searching for in this country. But at the same time,\
  \ i always felt gratitude that i found so much realization that in this country\
  \ which is hard to live as a Muslim, i can perform my hajj that it was almost never\
  \ slipped into my head before since it\u2019ll make me at least wait around 25 years\
  \ if i plan to go from my country. I also manage to engage with a new community\
  \ i never come any closer. a worker community, friends that I've spent time during\
  \ my pilgrimage\nIn this country also, as it is beautiful and clean as it was shown\
  \ in their. promotional picture, k-drama and even k-pop video clip, made me felt\
  \ gratitude towards the beautiful creation of Allah SWT. I always hope that even\
  \ Indonesia is famous for its beautiful scenery, transportation is hard to find,\
  \ and that itself made the tourist destination hardly developed. South Korea is\
  \ a beautiful and clean country. The transportation is great. People can easily\
  \ access it through their own cellphone and since it also implemented disciplines\
  \ similar to Japan, the waiting time is as thin as a thread. Even when you go to\
  \ another city like Daegu or Busan, the facilities are identical. The problem arouses\
  \ when someone cannot engage with local\u2019s languages since they barely use English.\
  \ So, a dictionary or translator is a must. \nFall is always my favorite season.\
  \ The sun is covered by clouds, and the weather is between the breeze and warm marking\
  \ toward winter. The scenery itself covered with reds and yellows everywhere we\
  \ go. I always suggest my friend and colleagues that wanted to visit Korea to come\
  \ during the fall season. \nIt is my dream to travel more to another country so\
  \ that i can show my gratitude toward Allah SWT that the creation is really breathtaking\
  \ and more appreciate myself and treasure the spiritual journey that I\u2019ve been\
  \ found as far as a stayed in South Korea"
