Text: "Travel is a true education for me knowing people around and opening up my mind\
  \ with different thoughts and experiences. This is the favourite part of my life\
  \ which is gifted me ever to keep Travelling and never stop myself at one place.Swiss\
  \ visit is one of this which is still eyefilled in my eyes. \n\nI dreamt of this\
  \ place since my childhood and got an opportunity to travel to this place in 2016.\
  \ It's been 2.5 years but the beauty of the Alps and the place is still alive right\
  \ at this time. I landed in lucernce which is known for it beautiful chapel bridge\
  \ architecture which sits at snowcapped mountains. My travel is my dicovery to the\
  \ place, people and things around.skiing at Mt Rigi was one  of the best and the\
  \ travel to that place in local train and cable car was worth it. Two days of my\
  \ time was all with mountains and never could express my love towards it in words.\
  \ I still wish to travel back again to this place because there is lot more to explore.\
  \ Connecting to different people and locality brings a different experience knowing\
  \ then and their activities around. it was total fun with memories to carry through\
  \ my life ."
