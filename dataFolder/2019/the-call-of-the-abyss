Text: "The sun has just raised when my sister and I took the road heading south. We\
  \ were leaving Santa Catarina island under the warm sunrise of a summer day. The\
  \ trip went well, between coast, valleys and mountains. At every bend in the road,\
  \ the landscape of southern Brazil transformed from the heavy urban area and its\
  \ factories into greener and more dazzling landscapes with the flora thrilling us\
  \ with its thousand-color flowers.\n\nWe arrived at the destination in the early\
  \ afternoon, Cambar\xE1 do Sul has only six thousand inhabitants, a cold Brazilian\
  \ city, one of the rare mountain cities of Brazil that more than once experienced\
  \ the snow. We spent that afternoon and the night exploring the small town and its\
  \ few streets, small markets, bars and the traditional square with a Church, so\
  \ typical of any Brazilian town. Being there for the first time brought me a new,\
  \ confused feeling: it was the smallest town I've ever been in, the most picturesque.\
  \ And I could not even name my feelings that were a mixture of fascination, curiosity\
  \ and strangeness.\n\nThe small town\xB4s wide streets and its calm are interrupted\
  \ by powerful Jeeps that look for the immense crevices in the mountains. We were\
  \ also there for the cracks, we were looking for the place that presented visible\
  \ scientific evidence of the point where Brazil separated from Africa when both\
  \ were part of the immense Pangea.\n\nNext morning, early, we took the car and headed\
  \ for the dirt road that would take us to the place that had not left my mind in\
  \ the last few months. In a long and bumpy journey, the unique geography showed\
  \ us its strength: the climate changed several times during that hour.\n\nFinally\
  \ we arrived at the Aparados da Serra National Park, and there we would follow the\
  \ trail that would take us to our destination. After walking 3 km I saw a low mist\
  \ rising between the trees, it seemed something magical and indicated something\
  \ fascinating: the immense abyss was at few meters from us! I did not expect to\
  \ find something so magnificent and fascinating: Itaimb\xE9's canyon at my feet!\
  \ The immense cleft snaked the edge of the abyss where we were. A small trace of\
  \ a river ran below the 600 meter high. From the ravine also fell waterfalls whose\
  \ waters dissolve in the air. A peace and silence dominated the place that thousands\
  \ of years ago shuddered and divided with the force of a volcano. We took a time\
  \ to admire and absorb that peace.\n\nBut... we do not have the power to control\
  \ the mountains, especially those mountains. A few minutes later, a dense mist rose\
  \ from the abyss, rising and covering us, as if say: \"your time here is over.\"\
  \ We accept with respect. And we followed our way back that had now become damp\
  \ and ghostly.\n\nThe memories are made of unforgettable moments. And I'm sure the\
  \ mountain and its abyss know who was there and whom it wants to see back. I had\
  \ been in that canyon for over a year now. And I am  still waiting for the abyss\
  \ to call me again."
