Text: "Where goes a lady who have just arrived in Paris? On Champs Elysees? No! For\
  \ food, of course. After the flight and the long waiting at the airport you are\
  \ starving and if the hotel you are accommodated doesn't include your meals you\
  \ will start wandering the streets in search of something to eat. The most budgetary\
  \ thing you will consider will be the fast food restaurants such ad Mc Donalds and\
  \ KFC. If you are not fond of semi-finished froducts I recommend you choosing something\
  \ helathier. Go in the Starbucks and Costa cafeterias. Don't be fooled that they\
  \ offer only coffee.You will find out they have very interesting menu to choose\
  \ from. Fresh breakfast meals, sandwiches, eggs, crosiants and for sweets lovers\
  \ -muffins and whole grain biscuits. The price is reasonable and there is no difference\
  \ in the price you would have paid in Mc Donalds.\nRestaurants in Paris are luxurious.\
  \ And to admit the Bulgarians don't want to pay high bills. Most foods are gourmet,\
  \ which means that we pay a lot of euros for a miniature portion. I was witnessing\
  \ a comment like, \"Do you expect this to be enough for me? Is there s place where\
  \ we can buy  kebabs and meatballs?\n When you are looking  for trip offer choose\
  \  one with breakfast included (at least!) Bed and Breakfast packages are good.\
  \ \nIn the area of the Louvre, on both sides of the River Seine, there are many\
  \ nice restaurants that are quite tiny but at the same time charming with the surroundings\
  \ that reigns in them. They offer quite interesting food at affordable prices. \n\
