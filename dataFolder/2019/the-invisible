Text: "The train was trudging like a mule on the serpentine tracks in-between the\
  \ bulging hills embraced by the thick, milky fog. We set off early in the morning,\
  \ and by the noon, our clothes were already damp and disheveled, oppressed by the\
  \ heavy, humid air that seemed to coil around the throats of all tourists, yet somehow\
  \ spare every local, young, old, or in-between. \n\nWhen we finally arrived, we\
  \ still couldn\u2019t shake off our rapture with the stunning scenery we had just\
  \ beheld, passing through verdant slopes, lush tea plantations, and rugged hilltops.\
  \ This is supposed to be \u201Cthe most scenic train ride in the world!\u201D And\
  \ it was! Nothing could deprive us of this sensation, not even the fact that during\
  \ the entire ride, we had to stand squashed like watermelons on a train that was\
  \ too small to accommodate all the passengers and too slow to be considered a valid\
  \ means of transportation by Western standards. \n\nWhen we got off, still awe-struck\
  \ and woozy from the journey, we weren't too pleased to discover there was still\
  \ another hill to climb for us before we could reach our accommodation, a villa\
  \ perched on a vertiginous slope overlooking what seemed to be the busiest carriageway\
  \ in the entire of Ceylon.\n\nIt was already the second week of our trip, and by\
  \ now, we\u2019d collected irrefutable proof that Sri Lanka is one of the most underrated\
  \ tourist destinations. Lipton\u2019s Seat, Dambatenne Tea Factory, riotous foliage,\
  \ and sticky-sweet puttu \u2013 these clich\xE9 \u2018top 10\u2019 attractions were\
  \ calling our names in this area. Impatient to get going, we tossed dusty backpacks\
  \ on the bed and got ourselves ready to tick the first diversion off our to-see\
  \ list.\n\nAs we were leaving, refreshed by a quick shower and amped-up to start\
  \ exploration, we bumped into the hostess. She invited us in a resolute voice to\
  \ join her for a snack. We followed her, timidly, to an enormous living room. I\
  \ quickly scanned the interior, fidgeting on a gigantic leather couch. The monstrous\
  \ walls were covered with what I took for peculiar wooden paneling. As I reflected\
  \ upon the imposing, traditional decor, this seemed to be a rather well-off house,\
  \ considering the circumstances. Then, he entered. \n\nA short, sturdy man in late\
  \ forties (pure guess, I found it very hard to assess people's age in this area,\
  \ especially in the mountains) joined us. He was wearing a sarong, proudly. That\
  \ was the host. He smiled and sat next to us. I could feel that the skin of his\
  \ palm was rough and callused as he stretched out his hand. I can\u2019t recall\
  \ his name, but distinctly remember one word that is still chiming in my ears. Military.\
  \ \n\nThen it transpired to me. I looked again at the wall. Panel by panel, casing\
  \ by casing, they started to materialize in the blur of what I thought to be a wooden\
  \ wall. I turned my head and started counting the giant shell casings lining all\
  \ the walls at attention. My count stopped at 50, but there must have been at least\
  \ five times as many. How come I didn\u2019t notice them before? \n\nWe were in\
  \ a mostly Tamil village. Suddenly, I remembered my history lessons. A minute ago\
  \ I was one of those blissfully ignorant tourists raving about \u2018how pristine\
  \ this place was.\u2019 I admired the spectacular beaches, untamed wilderness, and\
  \ breath-taking temples. Now it hit home with me. I didn\u2019t expect to find myself\
  \ sitting in the home of a person who probably partook in one of the most brutal\
  \ civil wars of the past century. But there I was.\n\nI came out to the balcony\
  \ and sank into a mangled wicker chair. Sipping on trickly milk tea, I looked ahead.\
  \ In the distance, sandy clouds of red dust were billowing into the sky over a makeshift\
  \ outdoor court. Scraggy teenagers were playing volleyball, the official sports\
  \ discipline of the entire Sri Lankan nation..."
