Text: "Passionate about going to the least visited places, I packed my backpack in\
  \ the early morning of October 2017, had a quick breakfast of half cold coffee and\
  \ a slice of bread with butter that was prepared by an Iranian woman at the small\
  \ hostel in the capital of Georgia Tbilisi. On the train, I shared the cart with\
  \ a Korean guy and had a nice discussion and we shared some advice on places to\
  \ visit around the country. When I arrived at Zugdidi station I had to take a minibus\
  \ to the border. I was the only foreigner on the ride that made me a bit nervous\
  \ at the beginning from this but later I realized how friendly Georgians are. We\
  \ stopped a couple of times to pick some people on the road and finally arrived\
  \ at the border of Abkhazia. I walked with locals toward the border, many people\
  \ were riding donkeys and horses but I preferred to walk the bridge over Inguri\
  \ River. After giving my documents it took around 45 minutes from the officer to\
  \ get back to me as I am from Palestine which unfortunately not recognized by many\
  \ countries around the world. Then smoothly I found a minibus to take me to Sukhumi.\
  \ \nAt first sight, I was surprised by the huge number of abounded buildings in\
  \ every corner. But then I was occupied of finding my hotel which after asking many\
  \ people on the streets discovered that it is an address for a house. It was difficult\
  \ to communicate in English because most of the people speak Russian but a young\
  \ couple called their friend who arrived to help me in finding my place. I was given\
  \ a cozy room, my host asked if I need to shower or food. They were a grandmother\
  \ with two men in the early thirties. However, they do not know one single work\
  \ in English. I had to use Google translate to talk to them. It was so funny when\
  \ communicated this way because the people were too friendly and they wanted to\
  \ chat but the language was a real barrier. After I rested for two hours I went\
  \ for a small walk around the city. Walked by the sea, bought some souvenirs and\
  \ observed the sunset. While the sun dropped slowly into the sea, it reflected the\
  \ rays over the abandoned ships which dominate some part of the scene and you unconsciously\
  \ jump into the darkness of human history; who was the last to use this ship? What\
  \ happened to the people who left? Did they reconcile of the fact that they may\
  \ die away from the place they called it home? Did they have new homes? Is it as\
  \ warm as those abandoned houses? My mind captured that moment of departure when\
  \ they have to leave. Did they collected their belongings or it was a moment, a\
  \ glimpse then they left their past to unknown present. \nDespite that these kind\
  \ of structures usually drawn in an image of horror where ghosts reside in Hollywood\
  \ movies, they have spectacular aesthetic scenes of the city. You feel them talk\
  \ to you, telling you the untold story about people you will never meet. About a\
  \ moment of happiness that still unfinished. I was totally captured about the emptiness\
  \ of structures and imagination of what could have happened in the sense that after\
  \ trips of forty destinations as a female solo traveler I consider this trip as\
  \ one of the best travel experiences in my life so far. Many people will feel comfortable\
  \ to go to the known touristic attractions but Abkhazia is worth visiting."
