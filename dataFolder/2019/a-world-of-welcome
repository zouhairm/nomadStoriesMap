  \ groups of girls going, unless you\u2019re joining a guide or a tour.\u201D Warnings\
  \ like this are what greeted me as I researched visiting Morocco as a solo female\
  \ traveler. What greeted me when I stepped out of Marrakech Menara Airport were\
  \ warm air and fading light, a group of boys who were playing soccer in an abandoned\
  \ lot, and not one bus or taxi. It was past 10 o\u2019clock and the message board\
  \ warnings echoed in the back of my head as I tried to decide what to do.\n\n\u201C\
  Hey, America,\u201D yelled one of the boys who was playing soccer. When I looked\
  \ over, he dipped his head and stuck both arms in the air. As a grade school teacher,\
  \ I knew exactly what this gesture was and, with the weight of foreign currency\
  \ in my pocket and a scarf covering my hair, its familiarity was a comfort. I \u201C\
  dabbed\u201D in return and yelled back, \u201CHey, Marrakech!\u201D The boy laughed\
  \ and responded with one word: welcome. I decided to walk the five kilometers into\
  \ the heart of the medina.\n\nAlong the way, what I encountered were families. Whole\
  \ families piled onto one motorbike, the smallest member secured between mom and\
  \ dad. Families spilled onto the grass with picnic blankets in tow. Families dipping\
  \ into the cement reservoirs that irrigated the olive groves to escape the heat\
  \ that was oppressive even through the night. As I walked deeper into the maze that\
  \ is Marrakech, I found more familiarities that chipped away at the mental wall\
  \ of otherness that had built up around this city.\n\nI got lost three times before\
  \ finally finding a arrow chalked onto the wall of a building that pointed the way\
  \ to my hostel. The street snaked around, unmarked, and too narrow for any American\
  \ car to make its way down. Cats lounged at every corner and dotted the salmon-colored\
  \ landscape. I arrived to a locked door and tentatively knocked. After three raps,\
  \ Houssin greeted me with a wide smile, a head of unruly curls, and a book in hand.\
  \ When he found out that I walked from the airport, he told me that I was smart\
  \ to save myself an expensive taxi ride and that I was brave not because it\u2019\
  s at all dangerous, but because it is quite a distance in the heat. He told me to\
  \ rest and come up to the roof of the riad for breakfast. \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ Houssin was on the roof, preparing eggs and bread in an outdoor kitchen. He poured\
  \ me mint tea that was so sweet it made my head spin with satisfaction. When I asked\
  \ if he would eat as well, he reminded me that it was Ramadan and the families I\
  \ saw eating by moonlight were breaking the fast that was guided by daylight. The\
  \ next day, I fasted as well. The heat and the lack of food made me lethargic but\
  \ focused. That night, hostel guests from Canada, Venezuela, and the US circled\
  \ around Houssin and his seemingly bottomless teapot, listening to the story of\
  \ his parents\u2019 marriage, their expectations of him, and his family\u2019s dedication\
  \ to Islam.\n\nI filled my days exploring the mosques and tanneries, chatting with\
  \ merchants in the medina. I bought a pair of babouche slippers from a craftsman\
  \ whose son spoke English and told me how he learned the language not from school,\
  \ but from travelers and TV. Each night, I told Houssin about the people I met and\
  \ his pride for his city was evident in the way he listened so carefully.\n\nWhen\
  \ the day came for me to leave, I packed my sweat-hardened clothes. I walked about\
  \ halfway down the twisting street of the hostel before turning back. Houssin answered\
  \ on the first knock. I told him that I wanted to take his portrait. I had photos\
  \ of the landscapes, the colors, and the sights of Marrakech, but my visit centered\
  \ around the friendship we shared. That is what I wanted to capture. He smiled so\
  \ big, I didn\u2019t even have to direct him. I took the photo. I waked the five\
  \ kilometers to the airport."
