Text: "The two and half hour car drive on the magnificent continental Autobahn at\
  \ the speed above 140 km/h afforded a whirlwind glimpse of German countryside, ancient\
  \ schlo\xDFes, overhead and underground passages and nearby towns and cities. The\
  \ tranquility of the river Main, the infatuation with the persona of Johann Wolfgang\
  \ von Goethe and the panorama of Alte Oper were enough reasons to create anxiety\
  \ in us as our car was heading towards Frankfurt- the fifth biggest city in Germany\
  \ and Europe\u2019s economic and transport center which is more famous for its skyscrapers,\
  \ trade exhibitions, book fair and North American skyline than for its unique cultural\
  \ identity and history. We were three people, a man and two women from Pakistan,\
  \ who were carried to her digs from Maastricht some 225 kilometers away into Germany\
  \ by our host Saira. \n\nThe feelings of majesty and awe gripped us as we entered\
  \ the house of our hosts in a drizzling winter evening in November last year. Hira\
  \ and Uzma, my female companions, were quick in exchanging \u201Cwows\u201D.., hugs,\
  \ shrieks and formal informalities with Saira\u2019s mother who was naturalized\
  \ German from Poland. \n\nThe dining table was readied in no time as we eased our\
  \ stretched limbs in the drawing room. Deluxe and decorated with all sorts of our\
  \ favorite delights, the sumptuous dinner turned out to be a rare luxury for our\
  \ raving stomachs.\n\nA meticulously stuffed house of three bedrooms had enough\
  \ reasons to cast a genuine spell on the visitors. The ornamental and natural plants\
  \ and flowers, souvenirs, urns, dolls and cushions were abundantly flattering the\
  \ gaze in the warmth of dimly lit pale yellow lights and in the company of the house\
  \ dwellers who possessed and showed a higher degree of finesse and courtesy than\
  \ a common Westerner would normally show to casual visitors and friends of friends.\n\
  \nThe aura of the house was convincingly erudite. \u201CBooks, books, everywhere\u2026\
  ..and all the cupboards did shrink.\u201D The collection was as impressive as it\
  \ was holistic. From modern day political thinkers and fiction writers and bestsellers\
  \ to Greek mythology and Islamic mysticism, one would stumble at some literary masterpiece\
  \ wherever he or she chose to roam inside the house. It seemed the house was haunted\
  \ with Faust\u2019s spirit and Goethe\u2019s scholarship\u201D. \n\t\nOur host took\
  \ us on a window shopping spree later in the chilled evening which was filled with\
  \ our pilgrimage to the downtown main shopping area \u201Cthe Zeil\u201D. A quick\
  \ tour of big and amazing departmental stores and shopping complexes of Galeria,\
  \ Karstadt, and especially of MyZeil enthralled us with their architectural design\
  \ innovations. But the main attraction was Alte Oper and night view of the nearby\
  \ River Main where the stately female horse riders full of pride in Roman etiquette\
  \ were standing in front of the main gate of the Opera in the backdrop of colors\
  \ and lights. \n\nUpon our return at 8\u2019oclock in the night, the cozy sips of\
  \ tea and snacks were waiting for us in the drawing room where we planned to visit\
  \ Goethe- Haus and Maintower next morning. \n\nThe one hour visit to the house of\
  \ Goethe on Sunday was only sufficient to get photographed in front of the Goethe\u2019\
  s family music room, library, living room, puppet show and study. We quickly moved\
  \ forward to visit the Maintower in the nearby Neue Mainzer Stra\xDFe. Unluckily,\
  \ the fogy skyline prevented us from having a telescopic view of the city at the\
  \ height of 200 meters. \n\nPassing by the Japan Center and an ancient relic site\
  \ of Roman times and shopping districts, we reached the, \u201CLahore Kabab\u201D\
  \ in M\xFCnchener Stra\xDFe. The restaurant, named after my native town, offered\
  \ some of the best Pakistani food and raised a gush of nostalgia. The things were\
  \ set for us to glide back with Saira in the driving seat again. The Maastricht\
  \ city clock struck 7 in the evening as we entered the city. \n\nAfter a brief rest\
  \ and a cup of tea, Saira chose to revert. She had to get back to Frankfurt and\
  \ move on to Stuttgart where she had to attend her office on Monday. Against our\
  \ advice, she chose to defy Shakespeare who said, \u201CFrailty, thy name is woman!\u201D"
