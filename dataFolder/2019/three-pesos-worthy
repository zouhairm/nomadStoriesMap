Text: "\"Here we are!\", said the cab driver while parking his old (mainly) black\
  \ Lada in what appeared to have been a prehistoric bus station. In fact, the place\
  \ was filled up with colorful cars from the 50's. My wife and I didn't count that\
  \ stop in our plans to go straight to the airport. Our two-week trip was about to\
  \ finish and we were struggling with that end-of-the-trip felling of exhaustion\
  \ mixed with the need for enjoying everything until the last minute. Anyway, getting\
  \ late to the airport wasn't the kind of last-minute adventure we were looking for.\n\
  \"Don't worry\", the driver calmed us down, \"a friend of mine will take you from\
  \ here\". His friend was already there waiting for us. He didn't bother introducing\
  \ himself. He just nodded to his vehicle\u200A-\u200Aa classic Chevrolet that looked\
  \ like it had been built up using a patchwork of three or four cars of different\
  \ shades of fading blue.\nI watched closely as they handled our luggage from one\
  \ car to the other to make sure they weren't going to rob us. It was shamefully\
  \ unnecessary. Cuba has a long list of problems, but it is one of the safest places\
  \ I've ever been.\nHe told us to get in the car. He has brought his daughter with\
  \ him and she was already in the front seat. Then he jumped inside, started the\
  \ engines and launched to the bumpy road ahead. As the car sped up a warm wind coming\
  \ from the windows started blowing not so gently on our faces.\nWe focused on the\
  \ landscape outside trying to absorb the last sights of this remarkable puzzling\
  \ country. Poverty was all over the place\u200A-\u200Aeven inside that old Chevy.\
  \ Yet, Cuba remains unique, beautiful and totally worth going. But now we had to\
  \ face it\u200A-\u200Aour trip was over.\nWait! The driver's daughter was holding\
  \ a huge magnet all covered with coins. I had a last mission to accomplish! \"Do\
  \ you have a 3 pesos coin? The one with Che on it?\" I asked her.\nThere were at\
  \ least 50 coins on that magnet but none of them was that one.\nIf you are a tourist,\
  \ you probably won't come across a 3 pesos cubanos coin. Cuba has two currencies.\
  \ The peso cubano (CUP) is used by the Cubans on their daily business. There is\
  \ also the peso convertible (CUC) that is mostly used by tourists. As a tourist,\
  \ I didn't need to use a single CUP.\nIn the 90's Cuba faced an overwhelming economic\
  \ crisis. In similar conditions, other Latin American countries watched their currency\
  \ slowly lose their value, leading to a so-called dollarization. It means that the\
  \ population began to prefer using dollars instead of their national currency on\
  \ daily trades.\nThe Cuban Central Bank made up an ingenious solution to this problem.\
  \ They created a currency that has the same price as the dollar: the CUC. For a\
  \ tourist it makes no difference using CUCs or dollars. Actually, the government\
  \ made dollarization official. At the same time, virtually all foreign money that\
  \ enters the island is bought by the Central Bank. So, the government can use all\
  \ of it to pay for whatever they consider necessary to import.\nSuddenly the driver\
  \ pooled over the car and ran to a paladar (a familiar restaurant) on the side of\
  \ the road. I didn't know what he was up to. He came back disappointed. \"They didn't\
  \ have the coin either\", he told us. I couldn't believe! He had just embraced my\
  \ quest for the 3 pesos coin! He tried again a few miles ahead. Fruitlessly.\nI\
  \ was glad just to see his efforts to help me. That was so Cuban! But he wasn't\
  \ done. He pooled over once again and\u2026there it was! A not-so-bright silver\
  \ coin with a dauntless Che Guevara on it. What a simple great moment to treasure!\n\
  When we arrived at the airport, I asked him how much 3 pesos cost. \"Nothing\",\
  \ he answered proudly, \"it's a gift. You can use it next time you come here!\""
