Text: "My new friend Mitch said it would be an easy hike. He had bright blue eyes\
  \ and an easy smile. So of course I eagerly agreed when he asked whether I\u2019\
  d like to go with him to H\xF6ttingeralm the night before at the meet and greet.\
  \ He\u2019d already been living in Austria for a year. I could practically smell\
  \ the leather of the lederhosen I pictured him roaming around the alps in, humming\
  \ The Sound of Music to himself as he frolicked. The Nordkette, the mountain that\
  \ juts its way drastically out of the city of Innsbruck, was still fresh with summer\
  \ grasses and wild berries (or so Mitch had informed me) and the mountain herself\
  \ seemed to be waiting patiently for us to start the trek up her winding trails.\
  \ \nMitch\u2019s spunky midwest enthusiasm was rubbing off on me as he introduced\
  \ the other English teaching assistant he had lassoed into coming: Grace. Up until\
  \ then she had only been a Facebook profile picture in a red cowboy hat proudly\
  \ exposing her armpit hair. Now she was the girl starting up the path with us, talking\
  \ excitedly about her life in Dallas and the hike ahead. \u201CAlm?\u201D, she asked\
  \ Mitch. \u201CYeah,\u201D he answered, \u201Cthe alps are full of them. We can\
  \ rest when we get there and have something to eat.\u201D This perked my ears. \u201C\
  You mean there\u2019s a restaurant\u2026 sitting somewhere on the mountainside?\u201D\
  . Grace nodded, seconding my question. Mitch smiled in answer. \nThe trail was lined\
  \ on both sides with greenery and tall pine trees that would occasionally thin enough\
  \ to catch glimpses of the city resting in the valley below. The air was fresh and\
  \ the people passing by were friendly. Or at least I assumed they were. I couldn\u2019\
  t understand tirolean dialectal German. We chattered away, enjoying the sun. When\
  \ we stopped for water breaks I would pretend I wasn\u2019t staring wide eye at\
  \ the path that seemed to only be getting steeper. \nA casual hour and a half into\
  \ this easy hike, we came onto a widening in the path that I can only describe as\
  \ the 90 degree angle I had seen in my 7th grade math book years before. Mitch,\
  \ registering the look of horror on my face, assured me we were almost there. With\
  \ gritted teeth and shaky legs I fumbled on. Grace, the recently graduated philosophy\
  \ major, graciously distracted me with the theory of absurdism. Half way up the\
  \ hill of death Mitch shouted back to us, as we had fallen behind his mountain man\
  \ pace, that the path veered off to the left into the trees. \nThankful to have\
  \ my middle school math class nightmare behind me, I wasn\u2019t paying much attention\
  \ as we came out of the trees and into the clearing. Sitting perfectly at home on\
  \ the steep mountainside was the wooden alm surrounded by grazing cattle. Each was\
  \ fitted with a massive bell on thick and ornately embroidered leather collars.\
  \ I know this particular detail because I was standing right next to one of the\
  \ unamused animals staring back at me. No fences. Just stone steps in the middle\
  \ of the cow kingdom leading up to the tables that offered sweet relief for my aching\
  \ legs. \nThrough the sound of my heaving breath, Grace\u2019s excited laughter,\
  \ and the cows jingling bells we gazed back down on the city, now so far below,\
  \ and made our way through the herd. As we sat down at the end of a table filled\
  \ with locals, we were greeted by a loud \u201CGria\xDF enk!\u201D. The deeply lined\
  \ face in front of us was waiting patiently with pencil and notepad in hand. I looked\
  \ to Mitch for help. He pointed out the staple Alm delites for us to try. We ordered\
  \ some mysterious dish the waiter pronounced,\u201DKniadel!\u201D, and a round of\
  \ ever-present beer. \nWhat he brought back were balls of kneaded bread stuffed\
  \ with cheese and bacon sitting on a bed of sauerkraut. I think I glimpsed heaven.\
  \ After the meal, sitting in that Austrian picture book with my new friends, a full\
  \ stomach, and a golden beer in my hand, I decided maybe Mitch was right. The hike\
  \ was easy."
