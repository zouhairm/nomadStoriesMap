Text: "I don\u2019t usually swim. Nor can I. Yet today, under the shade of a twisted,\
  \ sprawling old tree, in waters as blue and clean as I\u2019ve ever seen or dreamt,\
  \ here I am. Completely uninhibited, I lay floating on my back, catching glimpses\
  \ of the sun bursting vibrantly through the gaps in the leaves above me. If I focus,\
  \ I can quite literally feel the stress leaving my body, through every finger, toe\
  \ and strand of hair. \n\n\nWe\u2019re in Kavieng, a small island in Papua New Guinea.\
  \ The island is still relatively untouched, and it\u2019s absolutely abounding with\
  \ natural beauty that\u2019s reflected in both its landscapes and its people. Here\
  \ I can hear my four-year olds' laugh clearer than perhaps I ever have, without\
  \ the white noise of schedules, studies, to-do-lists and meal plans. And even louder\
  \ than her bubbling giggles are that of our neighbours. \n\nA group of fifteen local\
  \ children are on the beach next to us making use of their favourite piece of play\
  \ equipment \u2013 an old, bent palm tree stretching out over the water\u2019s surface.\
  \ They don\u2019t have swimming suits, only their birthday suits, and they don\u2019\
  t have fancy toys, floaties or picnic mats. Yet their laughter may well drown out\
  \ the ocean itself. \n\nMy daughter, Maya, and I exchanged glances, and after gaining\
  \ permission from the family, swam over to the children to join in on the flipping\
  \ fun (literal flips!). I wondered as we were dragging our bellies through the sandy\
  \ water towards them if they might become shy and leave upon seeing us approaching\
  \ or deny us entry to their share of the beach. The opposite couldn\u2019t be truer.\
  \ Their smiles were from another world, beaming so bright and big it spreads to\
  \ your own face in a matter of milliseconds. They grabbed my daughter and kissed\
  \ her head, spun her around, and held her as she braved the waters. They brushed\
  \ my skin, laughed at my hapless swimming attempts and pulled me up onto their tree\
  \ trunk, Maya right behind me.\n\nThough none of them older than ten years old,\
  \ these kids were skilled, confident and strong, with a deep understanding and respect\
  \ of the ocean. Standing at the very end of the tree trunk, they would bounce until\
  \ the entire tree was swaying up and down enough for them to launch into themselves\
  \ into somersaults. Frontwards. Sidewards. Backwards. Every-which-way-wards. \n\n\
  They watched eagerly as I attempted to make my way towards the fun. I can proudly\
  \ say I made it two and a half steps on the slippery, swaying tree trunk before\
  \ ending up back (face first) in the water. Maya held tight to her new friends,\
  \ and with beaming energy and bravery, leapt as far as she could into the salty\
  \ water beneath her. \n\nMaya and I both straddled the tree trunk again before being\
  \ hoisted up by our friends for another round. They laughed at me, clapped for Maya,\
  \ swam with us, chased us, ran from us, tagged us, held onto us, helped us and smiled\
  \ with us. \n\nMaya had brought a bucket and sand toys to the beach, and before\
  \ leaving decided she would give it to one of the girls as a gift. The little girl\
  \ smiled at her and they hugged a best friend hug. The next day and many more after,\
  \ Maya asked to return to her favourite beach where all her new friends were playing.\
  \ If we could have stayed forever, we would have. For now, though, we have memories\
  \ of laughter and smiles that nobody can beat."
