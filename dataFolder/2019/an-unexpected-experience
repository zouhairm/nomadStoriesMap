Text: "As I sat staring out the window on this small ferry as i crossed the straight\
  \ of Gibraltar,\nI couldnt help but think to myself \"was I really about to enter\
  \ Africa for the first time?\" \n\"Did I really just spend 80 euros on a roundtrip\
  \ ferry from the southern tip of europe to Tangier, on the northern coast of Africa?\"\
  \nI did and there was no turning back now. \nFor whatever reason made me make this\
  \ unexpected decision, here I was, a Latino American sitting next to Muslims of\
  \ all different shapes and sizes about to enter an exotic land for the first time.\
  \ \nAs we finally entered port I disembarked into a whirlwind of Arabic and a culture\
  \ shock I was definitely not expecting. \nI walked down to the main road only to\
  \ be swarmed by groups of men looking to be my \"guide\" around the city.\nNot knowing\
  \ what to do I waved them off and continued up the road thinking I could walk to\
  \ my accommodations, which I had just booked on the ferry ride in, since it didnt\
  \ seem so far. \nA older man approached me and offered to walk with me and carry\
  \ my bags, and I couldnt help but think how friendly Muslims really are, especially\
  \ all the negative views they get back in the states. \nWe walked and talked and\
  \ made small conversations about global issues and life,\nUntill he mentioned that\
  \ it was a unique time for me to visit because it was Ramadan. \nI paused and realized\
  \ what he just said,\nMe, an American, have just entered a majority Muslim country\
  \ during the holiest time of the year for them.\nI wont lie and say I wasnt a little\
  \ nervous,\nknowing how much animosity there is between the west and Muslim culture\
  \ and religion.\nI think the old man realized it and reassured me that I would be\
  \ perfectly fine aslong as I stuck with him or someone who knows the city very well.\
  \ \nWhen we finally made it to the hotel I tipped the man and told him I needed\
  \ time to unpack and check in and I would see him later. \nAfter settling in in\
  \ went to the rooftop kitchen that overlooked the city to get some early dinner.\
  \ \nThe place was deserted so I grabbed a chair right on the balcony and stared\
  \ out towards the straight of Gibraltar, where the Mediterranean Ocean meets the\
  \ Atlantic, the ocean passage that connects Europe with Asia and it's so close I\
  \ could actually see the Spanish Coast from my seat. \nI couldnt help but notice\
  \ the bustling city below me as I devoured a soup like mix of meat, egg, spices,\
  \ and dates. \nCars honking and bustling,\nas the sun began to disappear you heard\
  \ the constant yelling from the storefronts below as they started to close shop,\n\
  people on rooftops staring out over the ocean and enjoying the view, something I\
  \ found intriguing because even though they were able to see this view everyday\
  \ you could tell it still captivated them.\nOut of nowhere a man over a large intercom\
  \ came on and began praying and it seemed to have been broadcast across the whole\
  \ city because it was so loud.\nThen a surreal thing happened,\nwithin 10 minutes\
  \ the streets cleared, the shops were closed, people dissapeared from the streets,\
  \ and it seemed in the matter of moments the city became a ghost town. \nI was shocked\
  \ how quickly the atmosphere changed and I came to find out that was the call to\
  \ prayer for the end of fastening that day. \nDuring Ramadan muslims do not eat\
  \ food or even drink water from sunrise to sunset. \nAn hour passed and I started\
  \ to hear the vibe of the city pick up again so I decided to go for a walk around\
  \ old tangier the part of the city I was staying in.\nAs I exited the hotel there\
  \ was the old man again waiting patiently as if he knew exactly when I would be\
  \ coming back out again.\nAs I entered the little street music began to play, food\
  \ was being cooked and a party atmosphere...."
