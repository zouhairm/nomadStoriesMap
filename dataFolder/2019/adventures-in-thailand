Text: "As I stepped off the freezing plane the warm, muggy air felt so good on my\
  \ face and my heart started beating faster with excitement and nervousness because\
  \ I was in Thailand for my first solo backpacking trip. It was a thrilling feeling\
  \ not knowing what to expect or whom I\u2019ll connect with on this incredible adventure.\n\
  \nRight away I met an American woman named Cindy as I waited in the immigration\
  \ line. While we were chatting I got an email from the shuttle service canceling\
  \ on me. I started to freak out because I was stranded at the Phuket airport at\
  \ 2 am. Fortunately, Cindy said her husband Joe was picking her up and they would\
  \ give me a ride to my hostel in Patong. When Joe picked us up he and I connected\
  \ right away because we were both Army veterans. They offered me their spare bedroom\
  \ instead of staying in a hostel. My gut told me they were good people so I gladly\
  \ accepted.\n\n The next morning I went downstairs to the kitchen and a woman was\
  \ standing there drinking coffee. Her name was K.C. and she was a Russian exchange\
  \ student that Cindy and Joe were hosting. I complimented her lovely tan and she\
  \ told me it was from all the snorkeling she had been doing. I told her that I LOVED\
  \ snorkeling! So that morning K.C. took me snorkeling at this hidden gem called\
  \ Ao Sane beach.  \n\nAs we walked up to Ao Sane I noticed how a lush green jungle\
  \ surrounded the cozy beach. There was a small crowd of people comprised of expats\
  \ and locals who were lounging about without a care in the world. The water was\
  \ such a beautiful teal sapphire color and the warm sand felt so good in-between\
  \ my toes. I was so excited to get into the water that I just ran straight in. K.C.\
  \ yelled something to me as I splashed into the water like a giddy child. Then I\
  \ suddenly felt this weird uncomfortable pain under my feet. The ocean floor was\
  \ covered in rocks and coral and that\u2019s what K.C. was trying to tell me. She\
  \ just laughed and told me to be careful since I didn\u2019t have water shoes, but\
  \ I didn\u2019t let that stop me from enjoying some great snorkeling. \n\t\nMost\
  \ of the fish I saw had these amazing tropical colors and seemed like they were\
  \ straight out of the cast of Finding Nemo. We were there for hours enjoying the\
  \ water and soaking up the warm equator sun. As the morning turned into late afternoon\
  \ the shore began to disappear so we decided to call it a day. Before we left we\
  \ moseyed on up to the beachside restaurant called Mahasamutr-Sunset Bar. It was\
  \ a Tiki style hut and the smell of the food was intoxicating, but we just ordered\
  \ coconut drinks because we were going to have dinner with Cindy and Joe later.\
  \ K.C. wanted to take me to one last place before we headed back. \n\t\nShe took\
  \ me to a very crowded touristy place called Promthep Cape. It\u2019s on a mountaintop\
  \ overlooking the ocean. We made it just in time to see the sunset. It was one of\
  \ the most beautiful sunsets I had ever seen in my life. The vibrant blue and pink\
  \ colors made it seem like heaven and the ocean were becoming one. But, as soon\
  \ as the sun went down storm clouds came rolling in and it started pouring rain\
  \ and to make matters worst we were on a scooter. K.C. drove as quickly as she could\
  \ to get us out of the rain but we were soaked and unfortunately, her linen top\
  \ became completely see through. As we were driving along you could see people\u2019\
  s eyes get real big and stare in shock. She was thoroughly embarrassed but when\
  \ we finally got back to Cindy and Joe\u2019s we laughed so hard we were crying.\
  \ \n\nThat wasn\u2019t the last of my adventures with K.C. or Cindy and Joe but\
  \ those are stories for another time. I hope my story will encourage you to connect\
  \ with strangers when you travel because you never know what incredible adventures\
  \ await you."
