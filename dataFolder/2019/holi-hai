Text: "\u201CIf you spray water colours at me, I won\u2019t get out of the car and\
  \ won\u2019t even shoot you kids!\u201D\n\nI declared with authority and felt superior\
  \ as the kids obeyed me, \u201COkay didi!\u201D. The camera in my hand was certainly\
  \ showing its colours, if not the green that the kids had drenched the car with!\n\
  \n\n\nAnd there we were, absorbing Vrindavan, or at least, trying to. As we walked\
  \ past the thread-like lanes crammed up with people smeared in all seven shades,\
  \ sitting in groups and chatting politics, I was wondering if the much hyped about\
  \ place was actually that mad during the festival, as showcased to the world, or\
  \ not. It was a long walk upto the Banke-Bihaari Temple, or so it seemed to be,\
  \ because we were left alone to find our own way. The catch? We had to keep our\
  \ glasses away fearing the monkeys who were famous for snatching them off your head.\
  \ And if your entire family has eyes that can\u2019t read the world without a lens\
  \ aid, you are bound to be at your slowest!\n\n\n\nAs we neared the Temple, the\
  \ Hoo\u2019s, Haa\u2019s and \u2018Radhe! Radhe!\u2019 ensured that I get the required\
  \ dizzy necessary to fit in, without consuming \u2018Bhaang\u2019, which is legally\
  \ sold at numerous spots around the city. Thus come out my arsenal: my spectacles\
  \ and the one true love of my life, my Nikon! My blurry world regained focus and\
  \ it was a sight to behold: A never-seen-before jamboree! But little did I know\
  \ that it was just the beginning.\n\n\n\nWe had started on our way to the Temple\
  \ all spotless and clean, only to be thrown colours at, painting us in the hues\
  \ of the place. A little girl also struck the \u2018Radhe\u2019 stamp on my forehead,\
  \ making me one of the clan. With a beaming smile across my face, I was enjoying\
  \ the madness around. And this girl with the DSLR was made sure that she is happy\
  \ by the crowd as they did not hesitate being shot and sometimes even posed for\
  \ her, gently brushing gulaal at her cheek after the click: I was exhilarated!\n\
  \n\nAfter such an intoxicating evening, we couldn\u2019t wait to jump into the sheets\
  \ and sleep away to glory, as soundly as ever! On the D-Day, the Holi-Day, we did\
  \ not do much. Just stopped by at random temples, greeted strangers, got thrown\
  \ colours at (yet again), and headed back to pavilion. Riding back home, I felt\
  \ rejuvenated and happy. I could feel the contrast in my being- the Vagisha a day\
  \ before and the one on that very day, were two different souls under the same skin.\
  \ I don\u2019t know what it was, but certainly, there was something in the air!"
