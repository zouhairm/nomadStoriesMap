Text: "When I heard about Cape Town for the first time, I was overwhelmed with feelings\
  \ of joy and mischief. \nI had it all planned out. \nNights at the beach, finding\
  \ books and falling in love. \nTo my surprise,I had encountered all three. The nights\
  \ at the beach were met with long island drinks and colourful umbrellas. The joy\
  \ of finding new books,outshined the colourful umbrellas. \n\nThis is where the\
  \ story begins. One would hope it would be the climax.\nMy story was so anti-climatic,that\
  \ even death had excused itself from my company.\n\nDecember 12th 2015, It was at\
  \ the peak of my vacation,that tragedy struck. \nSeapoint promenade was buzzing\
  \ with colourful lights and the sounds of laughter. I had landed six days ago, and\
  \ had been partying ever since. A few pen pals,that I had been writing to over the\
  \ years,had decided to meet up in Cape Town,South Africa. \nWe danced. We laughed.\
  \ We overspent. We found a hidden gem,at the tip of seapoint,known as the SleepEasy*\
  \ BNB.\n\nEverything was a dream. There was nothing amiss from the amazing time\
  \ we had been having. \nUntil,until I met Flavio*. \nWe instantly clicked. He was\
  \ butch and sporty and I was,well I was me. \n\nWe spent the duration of the summer\
  \ vacation together and had loads of fun times. Flavio* loved dancing and so did\
  \ I. Flavio thoroughly enjoyed quality food, and so did I. \n\nWhat I did not know,\
  \ was that Flavio* loved to becoming controling and abusive,as well. I did not.\n\
  \nIt was exactly at the end of the December,summer period,that a few of us decided\
  \ that we would follow the sun. \nI had called up Flavio* and told him that our\
  \ friendship was not really healthy and that i would be leaving. \n\nHe was calm.\
  \ He just had one request, that we meet up for one last drink. I thought to myself:\"\
  Hey, what would it hurt?\"\n\nThat night, we met up for drinks and it was as if\
  \ Flavio* and I had just met each other for the first time. There was so much laughing,\
  \ yet so little drinking. \n\nIt was time to go. Flavio* wanted us to get some coffee\
  \ and then we could split ways. \nWe went to his place and just relaxed. \nWe had\
  \ some of his \"expensive\" Douwe Egberts coffee and had made plans to meet up the\
  \ following summer for some more \"fun in the sun\".\n\nI always forget to fill\
  \ in the important parts. Death always has to remind me. \nDeath and I met that\
  \ same night,as I remember leaving Flavio's* apartment. \n\nNow,here I sit. Retelling\
  \ amd Narrating my story as Death pours us another coffee. \n\nHe reminds me,Tell\
  \ them. \nI was left to die,after being molested by someone,I had called a friend.\
  \ \n\nPlease dont feel sad for me. Don't even cry. Death,for the duration of my\
  \ summer days,had whispered in my ear to be careful of Flavio*. Death had visited\
  \ many of Flavio's* friends,after an expensive cup of Douwe Egberts. \n\nI believe,\
  \ the worst part of it all,Is that I chose to fly away with death. The stigma and\
  \ trauma of one man being molested by another,would push one to fall into Death's\
  \ arms. \n\nI dont regret my summer loving. I regret my inability to listen to others,even\
  \ if it was Death."
