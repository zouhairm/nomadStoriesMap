Text: "When my friend told me she\u2019d been sent to a town called Puke for her Peace\
  \ Corps assignment, I laughed. Serves you right! I thought, allowing myself a bite\
  \ of Schadenfruede Pie. As an environmental activist of the \u201Cbloom where you\u2019\
  re planted\u201D school, I thought Malou was cracked when, at age 63, she went back\
  \ into the Peace Corps for a second tour. You\u2019ve lived in Haiti, Malysia, Indonesia\
  \ and Somalia. If you want mountains, what\u2019s wrong with the Great Smokies,\
  \ right outside your back door? Stay put for five minutes, already.\n\nTruth: I\
  \ knew I\u2019d miss her. And I did, so much that, when she begged me to cancel\
  \ a long-planned trip to France and come to Albania instead, I groused, but booked\
  \ a ticket to Tirana. Then, I began having odd conversations with almost everyone\
  \ I knew:\n\t\n        You\u2019re going \u2026 where, again?\n\tAlbania? I feel\
  \ like I should know where that is, but \u2026\n\tAlbania? Is that \u2026 South\
  \ America? No, Africa, right?\n\nMind you these were college-educated people, some\
  \ of them well-traveled (as in, they\u2019d hit the major notches in the belt: Machu\
  \ Picchu, Thailand, Tuscany, etc.). This surprised me, because Albania had loomed\
  \ large in my imagination since I was nineteen.\n\nFlashback to 1973: Puttering\
  \ about the east coast of Corfu in a dinghy, the glassy shallows starred with sea\
  \ urchins. I\u2019d wound up beached, the last of my pittance of funds stolen while\
  \ I slept in an olive barn. Trying to figure out how to live, I\u2019d help anyone\
  \ with anything, including hunting octopus, a creature I could no more eat than\
  \ I would my dog. I rowed the boat about waiting for Red to pop up from his snorkeling\
  \ expedition. Then, the distant sound of gunfire.\n\nWhat the hell?\nRed tossed\
  \ his mask into the boat. Albania, he said, nodding toward the mountainous shoreline\
  \ across the narrow strait. Already, in early September, the peaks were dusted with\
  \ snow.\nWas that a machine gun?\nProbably some poor bastard trying to swim to Corfu.\
  \ If you ever borrow the boat, make sure you don\u2019t drift over that way. They\u2019\
  ll shoot you, too. The whole country is like a prison block. Nobody gets in or out.\n\
  \nIn the ensuing four decades, I heard little about Albania. A blip on the news\
  \ when the mad dictator Enver Hoxha was deposed, then silence. And then, suddenly,\
  \ I was there, in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201Cfair Illyria\u201D \u2026 Shqiperia from\
  \ the inside. Puke (think Pookah) lay at the end of a long day\u2019s journey upward\
  \ and into the past. The rickety blue bus featured a blaring soundtrack of Shqip\
  \ music, a cross between call to prayer and bouzouki dance tune. Through dozens\
  \ of switchbacks where the bus performed a three-point turns amid crowds of goats,\
  \ we climbed. The green lowlands stretched below, much as they would appear from\
  \ an airplane. In miniscule villages with house-faces pressed up against the road,\
  \ I glimpsed a world I had long been imagining, where every householder raised her\
  \ own bees, goats, and vegetables in her backyard. The occasional cow or horse grazed\
  \ in grassy lanes. Chickens darted everywhere, skinny and clever. The road tunneled\
  \ through hedgerows of bramble hung with ripe red thane, a fruit I had not known\
  \ existed.\n\nAlbania, Shqiperia, Illyria ... a rural place among towering mountains\
  \ by any other name is homelike to a farmer from another mountain town, even one\
  \ 5200 miles away. In the square, a farmer\u2019s market collected beekeepers, cheesemakers,\
  \ pans of birek, sweet or savory, hand-thrown tavs, pickled vegetables, fragrant\
  \ bunches of the wild-gathered herb tea chai male. I employed my single word, pershendetje,\
  \ a Slavo-Turkic take on \u201Cnamaste\u201D and soon learned to also express gratitude:\
  \ faleminderit as they gifted me with honey and fruit.\n\nBehind a display of fresh\
  \ eggs, a woman my own age, richly dressed in traditional embroidered wools greeted\
  \ me with a scant nod. I pulled out my phone and scrolled back to summer pictures\
  \ of my farm: black hens and fluffy chicks. Her black eyes lit up; she reached under\
  \ the table and pulled out a crate that held a black hen. Cradling the bird in her\
  \ arms, she gave me her smile. At last, I was inside Albania."
