Text: "Couple years ago I had one beautiful trip to 3 countries in a row: Vietnam,\
  \ Cambodia and Thailand. That is the moment when I accidentally fell in love with\
  \ Cambodia, especially Siem Reap.\n\nFor me Cambodia is an exotic place. I passed\
  \ by Phnom Penh, only had a quick stop for lunch then go directly to Siem Reap.\
  \ Yes because my main destination would be Angkor Wat \u2013 one of the largest\
  \ religious monument in the world. FYI, most of places in Cambodia use US Dollar\
  \ instead of Cambodian Riel, so no need to worry if during your trip you can't find\
  \ money changers outlet. I believe this is related to tourism matters. \n\nI booked\
  \ a small room not too far from the downtown. Nice bathroom and clean bed sheet\
  \ is all I need. All the people worked in the hotel seemed so excited to give me\
  \ all information I need about Angkor Wat and about the city. I also found some\
  \ brochure about the temple in my room. They add a gently reminder, not to buy things\
  \ and give money to children surround the temple. This is to minimize the number\
  \ of kids who choose to sell souvenirs instead of go to school.\n\nTo visit Angkor\
  \ Wat you need to rent a tuktuk - tradition transportation you can easily find all\
  \ around the city. The temple area is so big that it would be easier for you to\
  \ get around once you have rented at tuktuk. Plus, most of the tuktuk drivers are\
  \ having good experienced in facing tourist, so they can give recommendation regarding\
  \ the trip not only around the temple but also around the city.  And of course,\
  \ the most important thing part of travelling, they can show you where to find good\
  \ local food :)\n\nHaving the chance to visit such as very huge and beautiful temple\
  \ like Angkor Wat is really something for an ordinary girl like me. I'm not a very\
  \ religious person but I always love temple. I love the calmness. I love the smell\
  \ of old rocks. I love the sound of the wind passing through. I love seeing the\
  \ monks sit in silence having a deep conversation with their God. \n\nAngkor Wat\
  \ is so magical. Huge complex of temples with thousands of beautiful reliefs around\
  \ it. The temple give you fully guarantee that you will never lack of magical spots\
  \ for your photographic session. And most of the time you can always find empty\
  \ spot where you can take pictures and pretend like you are the owner of the whole\
  \ temple.\n \nI remembered see a young monk busy cleaning his prayer spot. Right\
  \ beside him there are a box full of colorful wool bracelets. I asked him what is\
  \ it for. He explained that he gives a wool bracelet for those who donate for the\
  \ temple.  It was something interesting for me, so I decide to give a little donation.\
  \ He asked me to choose the bracelet I want. We sat side to side. He said a little\
  \ prayer in his language. I didn\u2019t understand what he said, but I didn\u2019\
  t worry at all. I believe this man said good things in his prayer. He put the bracelet\
  \ on my left hand and pour some water to my head. It was very beautiful moment.\n\
  \nI left pieces of my heart at Siem Riep so I can go back there someday."
