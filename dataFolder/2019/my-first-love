Text: "I am from India, I have been an avid traveller all my life. Quite recently\
  \ I got a work opportunity to New York for 6 months where the whole time was about\
  \ working 10-12 hours a day from Monday to Friday with literally no time to travel\
  \ and explore around. But even with all this work problem, I used to make sure I\
  \ travel around even if it means travelling to a new city for just Saturday and\
  \ Sunday. When my visa was about to expire, I decided to take the grace period of\
  \ my Visa. So, I took whole month of my grace period and I planned a trip to Puerto\
  \ Rico (Rich Port they say and they are right). This was my first ever solo trip.\n\
  It started with of course taking the flight from Philadelphia to Puerto Rico (PR)\
  \ which i ended up missing and took the next available flight. my stay was in highly\
  \ recommended dorm there, I ended up getting there in the evening time. There was\
  \ a daily evening ritual in the hostel where every person in the hostel will sit\
  \ together like a family for dinner and talk about their day where everyone will\
  \ talk about their respective travel story. We all will get to know about each other\
  \ and end up tagging along with the person you like if their idea of travel matches\
  \ yours. So, that\u2019s what happened. \nHere starts the journey of Deepali (India,28;\
  \ Me), Chiharu (Japan,36), Natasja (Barcelona,28), Andy (Seattle,32) and Jesus (Texas,57\
  \ turned 58 during this trip).  Of-course there were people meeting us along the\
  \ way but these were my constants throughout my trip. A little bit of info about\
  \ us \u2013 \nMe, coming out of a break-up from an 8-year-old relationship and no,\
  \ it was not a sad breakup. I have been a great work and studies, good daughter,\
  \ girlfriend, sister until this day but this was time to start living for myself.\
  \ Hence, this trip was one of the decisions of my life because it made me love travel\
  \ more than ever before. So much so, that I really want to be a travel blogger.\
  \ \nChiharu, left school when he was in 6th grade and started working in a restaurant.\
  \ He opened 60 restaurants in Tokyo by the age of 26 and post selling off them,\
  \ he started traveling with his drone. Till now in past 6 years, he has covered\
  \ 60 countries, USA being the 60th. \nAndy, born and brought up in Seattle until\
  \ he was 22. He has been into modelling, porno videos (yes, I have seen one lol),\
  \ security guards to celebrities (one of them is Jimmy Fallon), worked in strip\
  \ clubs in Australia and what not. Ha-ha! and yeah, he is damn hot.  He is looking\
  \ for a permanent home in PR and he is finding someone to settle down with. \nNatasja,\
  \ born and brought up in Netherlands until she was 24. She moved to Barcelona and\
  \ was living with her boyfriend since past 3 years until one day she decides to\
  \ travel and break up with him for her sheer want to explore herself. \nJesus, 58-year-old\
  \ hunk (I won\u2019t say an old man as I wouldn\u2019t have known unless he told\
  \ himself), who is single. Born and brought in a Spanish household, works in a grocery\
  \ store in Texas and only way he connects to himself is by meeting new people across\
  \ the globe. \nIt was a fun filled trip them but one of the key highlight of this\
  \ trip was when we were stranded on the streets of Vieques (one of the island of\
  \ PR) as we decided to give our golf cart away since it was our last day there.\
  \ We started asking for lift from people passing by, and yes lady charm worked.\
  \ We got lift from a Police officer which we got to know after he offered us beer.\
  \ Ha-ha! It turned into a hell of the last day as not only that guy was a well-known\
  \ cop there but we were \u201Cdrinking and driving\u201D with a cop going beaches\
  \ with reserved policia (police in Spanish) parking spaces everywhere. To be continued."
