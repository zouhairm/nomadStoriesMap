Text: "Ice-bone fingers dug deep into the soft fresh white that blew all around our\
  \ heads, as we looked up and watched helicopter wings cut through the bright blue\
  \ air above us. We craned out necks towards the sky while holding onto the gear\
  \ that tilted our weight forward into the massive slab of Stob Coire nan Lochan;\
  \ sister mountain among a handful dramatic peaks, which together formed the valley\
  \ of Glencoe--a magnificent marker of the Scottish Highlands. \n\n\u201CFlight practice?\u201D\
  \ \n\nThe voice beside me shouted over the drowning blur of winds blowing at 50mph.\
  \ Another voice called out and I looked up in time to see a gloved finger pointing\
  \ directly ahead to the nearest peak: \u201CSearch and rescue.\u201D My eyes followed\
  \ the finger to a rope which had descended from the beast\u2019s belly, watching\
  \ as a small and unidentifiable bundle was reeled up and off the mountain.\n\nHeights\
  \ have always terrified me. Thinking back to my five-year-old self, I remember perching\
  \ anxiously at the tops of staircases. Learning to scoot myself carefully down,\
  \ rather than stand up and walk. My infantile \u201Cone step at at time\u201D method.\
  \ I am amazed at having put myself in this position. On this day I, among twelve\
  \ young and precocious climbers, had chosen to leave behind inconsequential stress--focusing\
  \ instead on the movement of our muscles. On the ground that shrinks as we climb\
  \ further and further away from it. \n\nOur instructors for the weekend are two\
  \ British ex-military officers. Mark--a trim, quick-witted man of inscrutable age--has\
  \ keen blue eyes, and silver-tongue to match his partner\u2019s hair. John, in contrast,\
  \ seems at first a quiet and pensive companion. He is however, no less sharp. Conversations\
  \ with them are engaging, and quickly cover substantial ground. Bouncing across\
  \ such topics as philosophy, action-sports, politics, and world travel. Everything\
  \ is dusted with the trademark sarcasm of British banter--a skill which I have yet\
  \ to fully get the hang of.\n\nOur group came to a halt as Mark jogged ahead through\
  \ a suddenly smooth valley. John alerted everyone that this is where we would stop\
  \ to break, and practice performing \u201Cself-arrests,\u201D using ice axes. One\
  \ by one we went sliding down the gully, axes in hand as we were taught to roll\
  \ over, and to dig our picks into the ground, using the drag of snow to keep from\
  \ falling further down the mountain. Shrieks of laughter and childish glee erupted\
  \ from our mouths as we slid down the makeshift chute. The discomfort of our freezing\
  \ bodies was temporarily lifted, in the midst of throwing snowballs; catching fragments\
  \ of the powdery white in our hair, in our eyelashes, and in the laces of our boots.\
  \ For this moment, we were playful giants reigning over a molehill. \n\nThen everything\
  \ became blindingly white. The ice whose cold I had forgotten raked across my skin\
  \ in its painful, stinging grains; spitting across my exposed cheeks in a way that\
  \ almost felt spiteful. We huddled tightly like emperor penguins, preserving whatever\
  \ warmth could be shared between us. We were instructed to prepare for descent.\
  \ \n\nFear squeezed its fingers tight around my heart. We had all been warned that\
  \ today, avalanche risk conditions were exceptionally high. I sat with shaking hands\
  \ and tears burning the corners of my eyes, painfully cold, attempting to put my\
  \ crampons on. Noticing my struggle, the hands of my friend, Ben, swooped in to\
  \ secure the metal hooks to my shoes. I felt like a child again. Wanting to scoot\
  \ back down. One step at a time. Behind me, the voices of my companions urged me\
  \ forward. \n\n\u201CThat\u2019s it! Walk with purpose!\u201D John shouted encouragingly,\
  \ demonstrating how to dig my heels in first, using the sharp teeth of my crampons\
  \ for a more stable grip.  \n\nSlowly, we returned to the solid green of Earth.\
  \ To look up was to feel detached again from the fear and the anxiety I had felt\
  \ only hours before. Exhausted, but no longer frightened, I smiled at the faces\
  \ that had helped me down the mountain safely. I was grateful to them--but also\
  \ to myself. The child peered up at the hill and smiled. \n\nIt had become mountain\
  \ again."
