Text: "\u201CYour love appears doomed, but will get better. Family will move close\
  \ to you and a baby will grace your couple\u201D. Pause. \u201CBe very wary of horses\u201D\
  .\n\nBy the time we finished eating our sandwiches, another miraculous birth had\
  \ been announced.\n\n\u201CHorses?\u201D I whispered to Asako, unsure of my Japanese\
  \ mental translation.\n\u201CHorses\u201D, my friend confirmed, downing my own water\
  \ bottle.\n\t\nThe lady who had spoken smiled at the sheet of paper in her hands,\
  \ folded it with respect and slipped it in her backpack. \nThrowing a coin on the\
  \ altar, she bowed as deeply as the winter jacket allowed her to and clapped two\
  \ times - her hands close to her chest. Then, she turned around to nod at the old\
  \ monk and disappeared behind the trees.\n\nSitting on a fallen trunk in the woods\
  \ of mount Yari, me and my friend\u2019s gaze could embrace the small clearing,\
  \ the wooden shrine, the monk\u2019s hut and the tips of our socks sank into the\
  \ grass. \n\nFor almost an hour we had been the only spectators of the silent flow\
  \ of pilgrims enquiring over their fate to the shrine of Haruna.\n\nUnder the scattered\
  \ trees, everything happened as in a cycle: a man would appear on the edge of the\
  \ glade. He would bow to the old lady in the hut, shook the cylindrical box handed\
  \ to him until one stick slipped out of the hole at its top. \u201CThirty-four\u201D\
  \ he would read out. She would open the drawer with the correspondent number on\
  \ it, pulling out the pilgrim\u2019s own omikuji, his own paper oracle. \n\n \u201C\
  Could you read it out loud, please?\u201D she then would ask, for the umpteenth\
  \ time that day, \u201CI would be really grateful\u201D. And so she would smile\
  \ through the evocation of successful businesses ventures and future marriages.\
  \ A final bow, and she would sink back in the chair, invisible to our sight if not\
  \ for a little, grey-haired bun. \n\nSomething, however, was breaking the cycle.\
  \ \n\nNext to the altar, a few steps away from us, the wires of bad fortune lied\
  \ bare in the wind. After one day, no unlucky omikuji had been tied up to them,\
  \ as tradition dictated, none had been left behind on the mountain to dissipate\
  \ the bad fortune of their receivers. \n\nA door gently creaked open. The old monk\
  \ came out of her hut releasing the beams holding up the shutter blind. \nHunching\
  \ slightly, she catching her breath hardThen, she looked at us and answered a question\
  \ we had not posed.\n\u201CI haven\u2019t seen my son in years\u201D. We drew closer\
  \ to her. \n\u201CI reached my retirement and had no money left. So, I thought that\
  \ in jail I could be happier, or at least not alone.\u201D She tied a paper sheet\
  \ to the rack. \u201CI rode my bike and went to the police station, and said - I\
  \ stole this. A small toy. A horse that my son had, when he was a baby.\u201D. She\
  \ tied a second omikuji to the wires. \u201CThe food was good and there were always\
  \ people, there, so once I came out, I wanted to go back in again, as everyone else\
  \ does.\u201D She tied a third tissue to the rack. \u201CInstead, I became a monk\u201D\
  . \nThe text on the extremities of the tissues was hand-written.\n\u201CI don\u2019\
  t want to see anyone sad. When I\u2019m here I write most of them myself\u201D,\
  \ she laughed nodding at the papers. \u201CBut at the end of the day I still need\
  \ to show to the boss that some are here. The bad luck, however, is just for me\u201D\
  . \n\nWhile making our way down the mountain, heavy with humid socks and with a\
  \ sadness we could not name, Asako stopped, turned around and disappeared behind\
  \ the bend of the path.\nOnce she came back, she had a small crumpled sheet of paper\
  \ in her hand. She handed it to me.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ll feel very lonely, but be\
  \ grateful. The smile of a stranger is the same of that of your loved one.\u201D\
  \ I turned the page around. \u201CBe very wary of horses\u201D."
