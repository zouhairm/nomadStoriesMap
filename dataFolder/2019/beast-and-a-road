Text: "The building is old, the wood creased with hard winters. But it\u2019s vibrant\
  \ with its red paint. A garden overflows the white picket fence, and I\u2019m struck\
  \ by how bucolic the scene is, hidden as it is in this pine forest. I lean my bike\
  \ against a tree. The panniers are swollen like ripe fruit, and the bike strains\
  \ against its load. I consider again that I should learn the Swedish word for beast.\
  \ That\u2019s my bike\u2019s name, after all. \"Good job, beast,\" I say at the\
  \ peak of each climb. \"Now let\u2019s fly.\"\n\n\"Hi hi,\" I call to the woman\
  \ on the porch. She\u2019s watched me cycle up and stands to greet me now, smiling\
  \ curiously. I hold out my water bottle. \"Can you fill this? Vatten?\" I turn it\
  \ upside down to show that it\u2019s empty, and she takes it, disappearing inside.\
  \ I wait at the bottom of the step. Above, the sky is a piercing blue. The smell\
  \ of sap is strong in the warm, still air, and I can hear the hum of bees in the\
  \ garden. The pines seem to stand guard around us. I close my eyes.\n\n\"Vart ska\
  \ du g\xE5?\" asks an older man who\u2019s come to the door. Where am I going? \"\
  To Stockholm,\" I tell him. \"I\u2019m cycling north to Stockholm.\" He asks where\
  \ I\u2019m from, in Swedish and then in English. \"Northern Germany,\" I say, though\
  \ I\u2019m not really from there. It\u2019s where this trip started, though. So\
  \ I think it\u2019s enough. \n\nHis wife returns with a full water bottle. I thank\
  \ her, trying to press some of the apples that I collected this morning into her\
  \ hand. She laughs and pushes them gently back to me, pointing to the apple trees\
  \ in their yard. She says something and though I don\u2019t know the words, I understand\
  \ that she\u2019s telling me to keep these apples \u2013 they have plenty. \"Tak,\"\
  \ I say. \"Thank you.\" They wave me off as I cycle back into the forest.\n\nIt\u2019\
  s Tuesday, and the sun is shining. The moss that blankets the forest floor to either\
  \ side of the road is impossibly green, and dappled with sunlight. When I see blueberries,\
  \ I allow myself a break to pick some and stretch my legs. I call these my butt\
  \ breaks. When you sit on a bike seat for this many days, after all, you get bruises\
  \ in unaccustomed spots.\n\nI arrived in Sweden on Sunday, and the sun was shining\
  \ then, too. On Monday, beast and I climbed for hours through rain that turned to\
  \ hail. At the top I whispered, \"Good job, beast.\" The rain lessened. Already\
  \ this bike had begun to feel like home.\n\nNow it\u2019s Wednesday, and my ankle\
  \ is hurting. I adjust the height of my seat, get some physio tape at a drug store\
  \ and tape my ankle, and hope for the best. Each small stretch to the next town\
  \ feels like a colossal achievement, and a motivation to push further. To Byarum,\
  \ 6 kilometers. To Brattebord, 6 kilometers. To M\xE5nsarp, 11 kilometers. It rains\
  \ periodically, and the temperature plunges. I promise myself that if make it to\
  \ Jonk\xF6ping tonight, I\u2019ll sleep in a real bed.\n\nIt\u2019s Sunday now,\
  \ and I\u2019ve strung up a clothesline between two birch trees at the edge of my\
  \ campsite. My tent is pitched in a field of blueberries. It\u2019s early afternoon\
  \ and my fingers are blue from berry-picking, and I feel giddy with the luxury of\
  \ stopping early for the day. I\u2019m ahead of schedule, and have time to lounge\
  \ for a long golden afternoon.\n\nStockholm appears on a Tuesday. What I didn\u2019\
  t anticipate was the loudness of a city after eleven days of silence. It\u2019s\
  \ overwhelming, and I take frequent breaks. \"We\u2019ve got this, beast,\" I repeat\
  \ with the rhythm of my pedalling. \"We\u2019ve got this.\"\n\nAnd we do, I reflect,\
  \ as I sit in a burnt-ochre caf\xE9 in an alley in Gamla Stan and watch the clouds\
  \ fly after one other overhead. It\u2019s dry and warm inside and the hum of voices\
  \ is almost like the rustling of leaves in the forest. I sip my hot chocolate and\
  \ think, yeah. We have got this."
