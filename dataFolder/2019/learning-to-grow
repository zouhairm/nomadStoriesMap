Text: "I`ve been too poor to travel most of my life, with a rather mundane trip to\
  \ Mexico being my only source of exploration, however I frequently visit other worldly\
  \ places both in dream and psychedelic states. I hope my honesty in this matter\
  \ does not void my consideration, as I assure you, this was quite a journey.\n\n\
  \ No more than forty minutes of silence pass as I wait for the psychedelia to begin.\
  \ Lying awake in my bed I start to experience the subtle effects of plant medicine\
  \ going to work, the ceiling begins to ripple, a sense of euphoria and excitement\
  \ wells up inside me, let the fun begin. Fragrances never before experienced waft\
  \ toward my nostrils, smells of cooking food, rushing water, and infinite expanses\
  \ of nature begin to wash over me. Senses you didn't even know you had are thrown\
  \ into perceptual phenomena like waves crashing over you, every few seconds a new\
  \ experience is added to your field of awareness as the bedroom you were laying\
  \ comfortably in moments prior is now replaced by god knows where. It isn't just\
  \ going to some place in your head, the walls disappear between your inner and outer\
  \ existence, no longer are the experiences in your head trapped there, they freely\
  \ pass in and out of your awareness as though you were in dream, without a body\
  \ present to differentiate inner and outer. \n  It is then the world tips over,\
  \ and I am hurled into the deep unknown, a place so alien the only logical emotion\
  \ is fear. The world spins as though you have been flung down a mountainside or\
  \ are in an immense cosmic washing machine, stripping away your identity and all\
  \ which tied you to the world of man, you have been birthed into a new world and\
  \ must learn to grow all over again. My body is not my own, in fact who am I? Whose\
  \ body was it to begin with? I am left with many recurring thought loops, I question\
  \ the deepest fundamental beliefs of my existence. Where lay the barrier between\
  \ dream and waking, and if such a border exists then in this instant where has it\
  \ gone? I miss my family and my friends, I miss my life and body. Isolated in the\
  \ black emptiness between realities I cry as I have not cried for many years, the\
  \ sobbing of a child who is all alone.\n  Perhaps someone heard me, some things,\
  \ they approached me as the space around these beings was warped to match their\
  \ homeland, they looked to be tribal mantis beings with an amazonian jungle feel\
  \ to them. They seemed friendly enough but I was terrified of the buglike beings,\
  \ my fear must have drove me away from them and again I was sent tumbling through\
  \ the ether.\n If you`ve read this far I thank you. Dream and altered states of\
  \ consciousness are very difficult to inscribe with such a simple tool as language,\
  \ the details could come pouring out of me endlessly but i`ll save that for another\
  \ time. Enjoy your day, and good luck to all the other contestants. Have a safe\
  \ trip!"
