Text: "The road isn\u2019t wide enough for two cars to pass one another. Our caravan\
  \ of rental cars slows as we parallel park next to a jagged rock wall. The safety\
  \ features of my Peugeot SUV are beeping madly, suggesting that my car is going\
  \ to hit a rock any way that I maneuver it. I give up, heave a defeated sigh, and\
  \ turn the car off.\n \n\u201CNova Vas means \u2018new one\u2019 in Croatian. I\u2019\
  m not sure anything new in this village has been built since the eighteenth century,\u201D\
  \ I smirk at Luke.  He\u2019s a model husband for joining us on this venture\u2014\
  \u2014sixteen members of my kin, all sporting blue hats emblazoned with BABICH,\
  \ negotiating the backroads of Croatia.\n \nAll the Babichs gather excitedly in\
  \ the road. \u201CCan you believe this place? Look at this view! Is that seriously\
  \ the house? Ya gotta be kidding!\u201D\n \nWe\u2019re an expressive bunch of Italian-Americans.\
  \ Or so we thought, up until a decade ago when my second cousin Missy\u2019s ancestry\
  \ research threw Croatian (not \u201Cnorthern Italian\u201D from Trieste, as we\
  \ understood) into the mix. In 2008, we did a heritage trip to our Italian hometown\
  \ \u2013 Corleto Monforte, in Campania. Ten years later, we\u2019re here to see\
  \ Nova Vas, in the Istrian peninsula, where my great-grandmother, Antonia Nacinovich,\
  \ \u201CNuNu\u201D to us, was born.\n \nStanding in the sweltering midday sun on\
  \ the unnamed street, overlooking a verdant valley and little else, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but think that Nova Vas made Corleto, with its population of 600, look like\
  \ a bustling metropolis. At least Corleto had a bar.\n \nThank God Corleto had a\
  \ bar.\n \nMissy is chatting with Anna, the woman who owns the house that NuNu left\
  \ back in 1913 with my great-grandfather, Giovanni Babich, who was from nearby Cepic.\
  \ Arriving in New York City 105 years ago, they settled in Greenwich Village. I\
  \ can\u2019t imagine there was much to do here in Nova Vas yesterday, let alone\
  \ a century ago. Maybe they met somewhere at a dance, realized they were too big\
  \ for this place and left the soir\xE9e early. Perhaps the night air gave her goosebumps\
  \ and he loaned her his jacket under a starlit sky, as they plotted their courageous\
  \ dream of leaving Croatia for a new life in America.\n\nI\u2019m sure NuNu never\
  \ dreamed that her descendants would be back, en masse, wearing matching baseball\
  \ caps and athleisure, ready to traipse around her childhood home like an open-air\
  \ museum.\n \nAdmittedly, I was surprised to encounter the damaged structure that\
  \ she once called home. The durable stone fa\xE7ade stood in total disrepair, overgrown\
  \ with weeds. There were splintered, heavy beams sticking up here and there that\
  \ were testament to a roof that had since caved in. And voids where the windows\
  \ were gaped like missing teeth with a broken wooden door that stood front and center.\n\
  \ \nWe stepped carefully through the brush and brambles to get close to the house,\
  \ yelping on contact with the sharp thorns, holding hands and trying not to fall.\
  \ Giggling at how unsteady we were and at the fact that we finally made it here\
  \ to our Istrian homeland.\n \nMissy wants to buy this place. We\u2019re terrible\
  \ at acting disinterested, and I know we\u2019re not doing her any favors by ooh-ing\
  \ and ahh-ing over every detail. Our cell phones are clacking away, preserving our\
  \ destination\u2019s posterity. We can\u2019t seem to take a group photo without\
  \ a chorus of \u201CTake the picture! Stop talking! Am I blinking? Are my eyes closed?\
  \ Okay, one more!\u201D after every shot.\n \nThere\u2019s a smithy attached to\
  \ the house, in a similar state of ruin, and I wonder what NuNu\u2019s father forged\
  \ there.\n \nI wander down the sloped front yard, picking burrs out of my leggings\
  \ and turn around to face the house. My family are embracing and telling stories\
  \ about NuNu. \u201COkay, now let\u2019s take one of Gen two! All of Gen two, come\
  \ over here and take a group photo!\u201D\n \nI smile, straighten my cap, and make\
  \ my way back to the photo-op telling my great-grandmother under my breath, \u201C\
  We\u2019re home, NuNu.\u201D I wonder if she can hear us."
