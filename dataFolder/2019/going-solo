Text: "As I stepped off the plane, my heart began beating so fast that it felt like\
  \ it might jettison from my chest. It was just me and my backpack. I had no one.\
  \ All around me were signs in a language I could not decipher, people who looked\
  \ different from me, and scents that I could not place. I was surrounded by bright\
  \ pastel, dilapidated buildings. I watched a child play soccer with a completely\
  \ flattened ball. I saw bicitaxis and classic American cars cruising down the streets.\
  \ I swayed my hips to the lively salsa rhythms. I sipped a mojito at the same place\
  \ Ernest Hemingway frequented. I was in Havana, Cuba. Immediately, I was thrust\
  \ into a whole new world, and this world had very limited wifi. I had immersed myself\
  \ into an unfamiliar environment, but abandoning familiarity would turn out to be\
  \ a liberating experience for me.\n\nMy first day was marked by anxiety as I struggled\
  \ to find my way around the city. Admittedly, I\u2019m a directionally challenged\
  \ individual. However, after a few days of walking various routes and getting lost,\
  \ I began to recognize my surroundings and even learned some shortcuts. Another\
  \ major struggle I dealt with was the language barrier. It\u2019s hard communicating\
  \ with people when you have no idea what they\u2019re saying (and vice versa) but\
  \ I learned that body language goes a long way. A kind smile when you\u2019re trying\
  \ to be friendly, a slight shrug when you\u2019re confused, or pointing in a general\
  \ direction when you\u2019re lost can translate into any language. People speak\
  \ a universal language with their body movements and gestures. It is just one way\
  \ in which we are all similar.\n\nSolo traveling can be a lonely and frightening\
  \ experience, but that is what makes it so empowering. You don\u2019t have the luxury\
  \ of comfort\u2014you are independent and must rely on yourself. But also, you\u2019\
  ll find that people are friendly and willing to help. You\u2019ll even make new\
  \ friends along your journey. I stayed in an Airbnb, where I was able to meet fellow\
  \ backpackers and solo travelers. I met Alp and Vanessa on my sixth day in Cuba.\
  \ As the other guests spoke to each other in Spanish, I felt slightly out of place,\
  \ until Alp told me that he and Vanessa spoke English and he began translating what\
  \ was being said. We sat on the terrace of our hostel, underneath the warm, night\
  \ sky, as we bonded over a bottle of rum. From that moment forward, I had two people\
  \ to experience Cuba with. The next day, we went to the beach together. As we laid\
  \ on our towels, fingers buried in the hot sand, we talked about everything from\
  \ our home countries to our future dreams. Within a day, they\u2019d gone from complete\
  \ strangers to my friends, and I could not think of anyone else I\u2019d rather\
  \ share that moment with. For my first time solo traveling, I didn\u2019t feel too\
  \ solo at all. Actually, the best part of my first time solo traveling wasn\u2019\
  t the country, but the amazing people I met during my time there. \n\nSolo traveling\
  \ can be a lonely and frightening experience, but that is what makes it so empowering.\
  \ You don\u2019t have the luxury of comfort\u2014you are independent and must rely\
  \ on yourself. I was forced outside of my comfort zone, but life is never supposed\
  \ to be comfortable. Sometimes, it\u2019ll be scary, but that\u2019s not necessarily\
  \ a bad thing. Solo traveling is an experience that reveals your strength because\
  \ you\u2019ll  be forced to overcome obstacles. One of these obstacles is being\
  \ alone, but traveling solo also shows that even when you feel disconnected, you\u2019\
  re actually more connected to yourself, your surroundings, and locals. If you\u2019\
  re up for a challenge and looking for a destination that\u2019s rich in history\
  \ and culture, then go to Cuba. You\u2019ll be Havana good time."
