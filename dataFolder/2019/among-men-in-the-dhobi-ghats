Text: "Once I arrived in Bombay, my only thought wasn't about visiting the Taj Mahal\
  \ Palace but about the Dhobi ghats that I heard about during my courses. \nAn Indian\
  \ friend brought me there and I could see from a bridge the extent of the Dhobi\
  \ ghats. It seemed smaller than what I expected. We could see in the center long\
  \ hallways of big rectangular vats made of stones. Some were still full of water\
  \ and soap. In others clothes were remaining in the side. At that time I saw nobody\
  \ working. Colorful clothes were hanging on wires. Those hallway were surrounded\
  \ by houses of slums. \nI took stairs and entered the ghats. I wanted to know more\
  \ about it, how it works. \nThey were all asking why a foreigner wants to know about\
  \ Dhobi Ghats without answering my question. But among those men I could find the\
  \ only woman who worked there and the only woman that I saw there actually.\nI could\
  \ see her using her feet in one of those vats full of water and soap, hitting clothes\
  \ on the water with her hands, then drying it.\nShe told me later what I wanted\
  \ to know. How they still remember the owner of those thousand clothes. Those clothes\
  \ are actually delivered there in motobikes with a name on each. Then a guy in motobike\
  \ come to pick them again and delivered it.\nI could see also machines there whereas\
  \ everything was made by hands. I was even more intrigued what was the use of those\
  \ machines. But still silence remains. \nWhen I finally went out and lead to the\
  \ Thief's market, my friend made me realize that nobody enters the ghats like this,\
  \ specially women. But I didn't feel the danger and didn't notice that we were surrounded\
  \ by men until I found the only woman there. The atmosphere was actually pretty\
  \ calm. And I would never thought that men were the one running the Dhobi Ghats."
