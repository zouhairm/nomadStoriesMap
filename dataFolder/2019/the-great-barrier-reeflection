Text: "As many stories usually start with some heartfelt tragedy mines started with\
  \ a breakup. I had never seen myself as wanting to be a traveller or even remotely\
  \ interested in the thought of airports and being thrown into the unknown, considering\
  \ the furthest country I had been to was Spain, a mere 2 and a half hours away.\
  \ However, after my earth-shattering breakup, I could think of nothing more appealing\
  \ than seeking comfort from the other side of the planet and as far as humanly possible\
  \ from Scotland. Seeing as outer space was out of the question my next best option\
  \ was the land down under. That\u2019s when Australia beaconed like a lighthouse\
  \ I the stormy sea I could finally see a light through all this darkness. I remember\
  \ it so clearly the day I was meant to be going to see \u201CMagic Mike XXL\u201D\
  \ with my friend as a sexy distraction to my pain yet when I received the text telling\
  \ me she was cancelling I had had enough. No longer will I wait around or rely on\
  \ anyone else to do things I wanted to do. I wanted to do something for me and me\
  \ alone. I walked straight into the travel agents and searched through their Australia\
  \ brochures and confidently picked my tour with a travel group. My mum quickly pointed\
  \ out that maybe camping and swimming with wild dolphins in the outback was a bit\
  \ optimistic for my first trip, so I settled on a more tamer looking gold coast\
  \ with the addition of the northern territory tour. With a newly bought rucksack\
  \ and a multitude of toiletries I\u2019d probably never use, I found myself alone\
  \ on the plane beginning my 24-hour journey. \nAfter settling into my hostel and\
  \ having a short exploration around Sydney on my own it was soon time to meet my\
  \ travel group for the first time. I was nervous but so excited to meet new people\
  \ in this kind of environment. After our formal introductions we went out for a\
  \ group meal, considering there were around 50 of us we couldn\u2019t quite find\
  \ a table big enough, so we split up and I soon made some new friends.\nAs the trip\
  \ hit the road and we nested into our coach we set of on our east coast adventure.\
  \ Considering my main fears in life was heights and sharks I couldn\u2019t really\
  \ believe it when I found myself at the top of the Sydney harbour bridge battling\
  \ 50mph winds to surfing in surfer\u2019s paradise and snorkelling in the great\
  \ barrier reef. I may have lost a couple flippers along the way once I seen some\
  \ reef sharks not to mention filled a few swear jars afterwards but undoubtedly\
  \ an overall success.\nOnce we reached the outback the feel of the trip changed\
  \ and the bug spray came out alongside my attractive mosquito repellent face net.\
  \ I soon became one with nature once a frog jumped up my toilet at one of the service\
  \ stations and our shared room became the breeding ground of iguanas. Its these\
  \ types of experiences that really brings a group together. \nNever did I ever think\
  \ id be a willing participant in signing up for something the openly called \u201C\
  The Cage of Death\u201D but out here in Darwin, I was a different person, with no\
  \ limitations and I felt free for the first time ever. It was refreshing and it\
  \ struck something in me apart from the obvious thought about how they were going\
  \ to tell my parents if I died at the mercy of a 16ft salt water crocodile but 49\
  \ countries later and a desire to never stop exploring my trip didn\u2019t only\
  \ change my life, but it changed my total outlook on life."
