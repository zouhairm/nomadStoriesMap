Text: "The train yelled it's last whistle as I ran passed the compartments of Varuna\
  \ Express. 'You'd find space to sit in the bogie next to the engine. Run!' a much\
  \ enthusiastic man yelled as my friend and I ran bewildered intending to catch the\
  \ train with 2 general compartment tickets in my hand. My friend pulled me up and\
  \ we found a seat to share the half of each of our bottoms, it was rather sufficient\
  \ space for a travel of 303 kilometers. With a budget of pauper of 2000 rupees and\
  \ a relentlessness to get away to a place unknown we planned an unplanned trip to\
  \ Banaras. \nThe chilly breeze of December hit my face when to my dismay I realized\
  \ the window was jammed and couldn't be closed. 3 AM in the morning our train took\
  \ its final halt to rest upon the tracks. Shivering and excited we landed on the\
  \ on the soil of the ultimate pilgrimage land of the Hindus. People come hear during\
  \ the last days of their lives to find Moksha. On setting my foot out of the railway\
  \ station I found bylanes, a steaming cup of hot tea, autorickshaw drivers who were\
  \ so willing to get a customer at that time of night they'd take you to the moon.\
  \ Our ride took us to our hotel where the receptionist had all the knowledge of\
  \ the ghats and the timings of the morning Aarti. Ceremony to honour the holy river\
  \ Ganga (Ganges) was to start within forty five minutes, we dumped our belongings\
  \ into the room and ran to, which felt quite next door to our stay, the famous Assi\
  \ Ghat. \nThe Ghat was flooded with guest from foreign soil. Each had a camera in\
  \ their hand, a jacket around the torso and a tranquil excitement in their eyes\
  \ quite visibly comprehended within their curious glance. As the Ganga Aarti started\
  \ it filled my soul with placidity. The chants reverberated my ears and my senses\
  \ for the entire fourth minutes.It was when the sun finally came out of its beauty\
  \ sleep and blessed the river bank beneath I realized how utterly involved I was\
  \ in the moment. Ghats or the river banks is the face of that city and there wasn't\
  \ any better way to experience it by walking along with it. 6:30 in the morning\
  \ my friend and I walked from one Ghat to another connected with line of staircase\
  \ and channel of small boats with their owners sitting upon them impatiently waiting\
  \ for their first rider for the day to earn their first income. We walked along\
  \ the ghats for maybe an hour. In Midway we met a sage smoking his chillum of marijuana,\
  \ chanting the name of Shiva. Upon reaching near him he smeared a handful of Chandan\
  \ ( sandalwood powder) on my forehead. The sudden act went unrecognized by anybody\
  \ present around as he took a long drag upon his chillum and my friend casually\
  \ grabbed my arm to take me for breakfast. A plate of Bati Chokha. Flour dumplings\
  \ and mashed mixed vegetables with Indian spiced topped with Ghee roasted upon a\
  \ charcoal grill. A cup of steaming hot tea. \nNever have I ever had such an eventful\
  \ turn of events in my life before from being surrounded by 400 people around me\
  \ sleeping away in all possible positions wherever they could fit their bodies into\
  \ to enjoying the most remarkably impeccable morning, gazing through the horizon\
  \ where river meets the sky, the sun heating up bit by bit drying the sandalwood\
  \ paste on my forehead. \nThe innumerable population around me engaged themselves\
  \ into their daily chores, yet the place seemed quiet. My first morning in Varanasi\
  \ gave me something new, it set me afresh. One must head to this city to experience\
  \ the new within you. Yes people may come here to die but it was a metaphor in my\
  \ case. All of a sudden the rush, the impatience and the worries faded away. The\
  \ inconclusive me was happy with my being and my existence. One will thank the universe\
  \ once they'll see nature in it's unadulterated forms. I looked to the heat and\
  \ did the same."
