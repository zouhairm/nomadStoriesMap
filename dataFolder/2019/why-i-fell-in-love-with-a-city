Text: "I am not a romantic person and I have never had a long-term relationship. But\
  \ this is the story of how I fell in love. \n\nLast year, I decided to go on a solo\
  \ adventure. I had already traveled to some places, but never alone. After quitting\
  \ my frustrating job, I left Brazil for the US in search of more knowledge for my\
  \ career as a Journalist. I have never imagined that the lessons I would bring back\
  \ home would go far beyond what the course that I took could teach me. \n\nNew York\
  \ is a dynamic and inspiring city where everything happens. You walk through the\
  \ streets and see movies and TV shows being shot all the time. Ok, that's a clich\xE9\
  . Everyone knows how exciting this place is. But this is not why the city captured\
  \ my heart. \n\nIt was because of the owner of the coffee shop on the corner of\
  \ my street that learned some words in Portuguese and used to make me laugh everyday.\
  \ It was because of the saleswoman that talked to me like I was her friend for years\
  \ and made me feel like I was at home on my first day alone in a different country.\
  \ It was also because of the friends I made that taught me so many things. For example,\
  \ how spanish people have their meals in a different time (they have lunch at 2pm\
  \ and dinner at 10pm!). Also, how ukrainians celebrate Christmas in a different\
  \ time of the year (on January 7th).  \n\nMy soul would feel of joy when I watched\
  \ the colors of the Central Park trees during the fall or when I walked through\
  \ the crowded Times Square. By the way, I know New Yorkers hate it, but as tourist,\
  \ that place is still magic for me. I saw how americans love to celebrate every\
  \ season of the year and I was able to experience this. Pumpkin carving in a tradicional\
  \ New Jersey Farm, Halloween parties, ice skating at the Bryant Park Christmas market.\
  \ I also watched Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and I had a traditional dinner with\
  \ my friends (they were my family there and the ones I was grateful for).\n\nI fell\
  \ in love with New York because of the people and the multicultural experience the\
  \ city gave me. During the three months I lived there I made more friends that I\
  \ made living in my country for years. That's why I realized I was made to be on\
  \ the road. Talking to people from all over the world, learning about different\
  \ cultures and telling the stories of who I meet on the way. \n\nI believe New York\
  \ is just a puppy love that I will get over. The truth is that my heart belongs\
  \ to the world."
