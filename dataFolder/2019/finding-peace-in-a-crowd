Text: "The finest golden thread glinted in shimmering lights, against the stark black,\
  \ embroidered cloth that adorned the House of Allah. A million people shuffled around\
  \ the mosque, lost in prayer, lost in thought, lost in the wonder that they had\
  \ finally been accepted to experience Hajj (pilgrimage), in all its chaotic, beautiful\
  \ glory.  \n\nThe sun had long since sunk behind the peaks of the mountains of Makkah,\
  \ and I sat patiently waiting for the call to prayer. I had spread out my mat an\
  \ hour earlier, hoping that today, at last, I would get to pray without distraction.\
  \ \n\nThe microphone was turned on, and that\u2019s when it all began.\n\nAs the\
  \ melodious Adhan (call to prayer) ricocheted off the marble floors, pilgrims started\
  \ jostling for space. Before I knew it, my treasured spot was invaded by three other\
  \ women, and I found myself squeezed between them with barely enough room to breathe.\
  \ I listened to the Adhan distractedly, frustrated at this breach of personal space\
  \ and human decency, silently hoping that it would be over quickly so that I could\
  \ breathe again. \n\nWhen the Imam (Leader of Prayer) sounded the one-word warning,\
  \ a hush fell over the crowd. In that moment I contemplated how lucky I actually\
  \ was to be sitting there, in that very spot, surrounded by a throng of people who\
  \ shared my faith, but little else. After all, I was not in my home, but in the\
  \ House of God; a place where all are welcome, and where there is space for everyone.\
  \ Hailing from a hundred different countries, speaking a thousand different languages,\
  \ with cultures and classes of all kinds, all with a single purpose- to leave everything\
  \ behind, forget all else, and focus on prayer for just five minutes.    \n\nIt\
  \ was actually quite a feat, now that I think about it, to summon forth complete\
  \ silence in a crowd that large, without the common thread of language binding everyone\
  \ together. Even more amazing, was the fact that even for a first time visitor,\
  \ just one word not only silenced us all, but even had everyone aligning into neat\
  \ rows, ready to follow the prayer. \n\nTalking to fellow pilgrims during the trip,\
  \ I had learnt so much about how people live in other parts of the world. In Muslim\
  \ countries like Turkey, quotas mean that people put their names down in childhood,\
  \ and often only get the opportunity to come when they are in their forties. In\
  \ poorer countries like Indonesia, people often sell all their belongings to afford\
  \ the trip, and re-build their lives when they return. It is not a compulsory trip\
  \ if they cannot afford it, but their faith is so strong that they sacrifice everything\
  \ to perform the pilgrimage. \n\nMy own grandparents could only afford it in their\
  \ sixties, and here I was at eighteen, having made no sacrifice to be here, and\
  \ it dawned on me how blessed I truly was. I had so much to learn about life, so\
  \ much to experience, and I realised that sometimes lessons are learnt in the most\
  \ unexpected ways. \nI put away my annoyance, focused on the prayer, and resolved\
  \ to befriend these women after it had concluded. I discovered that one lady was\
  \ from Lebanon, draped in a billowing abaya (cloak), another from India, cool in\
  \ her colourful chiffon panjabi (dress with pants), and the third from France, wearing\
  \ a fashionable frock. We were all dressed so differently, reflecting our cultures\
  \ and senses of fashion, but we were all covered from head to toe nonetheless, in\
  \ a show of faith. \n\nWe had no language in common, and I did not find out much\
  \ else about them. But somehow we all thought to share some treats with each other,\
  \ which we had brought from our homelands. Where language can sometimes be a barrier,\
  \ food is a universal binder. I set off on pilgrimage to cement my faith and fulfil\
  \ my obligation, but I never expected to find peace and understanding on a mosque\
  \ floor, far from home, surrounded by strangers that I could not speak to, sharing\
  \ sweets whose names I could not pronounce\u2026"
