Text: "My first international trip was to a developing country. \nI clenched my fists\
  \ together as the chicken bus inhaled its last few breaths of life, heaving its\
  \ passengers up the Guatemalan mountainside. I tried to imagine a greater barrier\
  \ between the bus and the naked cliff edge I peered over from my seat, wondering\
  \ if it was a mistake to leave the United States. As the bus sighed to a halt outside\
  \ our accommodation in the mountains of Solol\xE1, I realized studying abroad would\
  \ require far more than simply showing up to class. \nStepping off the bus was like\
  \ entering a new world. One of our frequent destinations was Lake Atitlan, a sapphire-blue\
  \ lake in the valley of Guatemala, surrounded by a panoramic view of mountains and\
  \ volcanoes. By boat, visitors can travel to any of the cities nestled in the splendor\
  \ of the valley.\nIn San Lucas, we walked through markets where animal flesh hung\
  \ from meat hooks and fish eyes met our gaze. The sound of women patting dough to\
  \ form tostadas between their hands seemed to keep time with our footsteps. We remained\
  \ in sync until the patting dissipated and the crowd parted. High above the city\
  \ we found ourselves outside a church painted stone white, which stood in contrast\
  \ to the lush green landscape.  \nIn search of a bathroom, our tour guide led me\
  \ to a building without windows or doors. It was cement and held the color of Guatemalan\
  \ dirt. The bathroom stall contained a mop bucket where flies congregated. The walls\
  \ were stained with blood. The toilet held the color of rusted water and the same\
  \ Guatemalan shades of dirt. To my disbelief, our tour guide explained that locals\
  \ would access this space for emergency and routine hospitalization. It appeared\
  \ vacant but the image of the blood on the bathroom walls flashed in my mind. \n\
  In the markets of Solol\xE1 we witnessed a woman waving her mangled hand and speaking\
  \ furiously in a language I could not understand. On our bus a man stood up and\
  \ spoke. Our professor translated that he had a condition, which deteriorated his\
  \ gait. Unable to work, he relied on contributions from strangers to support his\
  \ family. Gold coins were passed between the hands of strangers that filled the\
  \ bus. Tears flowed from his eyes in gratitude. \nI entered the church in San Lucas\
  \ with thoughts of the hospital still heavy on my mind. An abundance of flowers\
  \ and their sweet fragrance permeated the room adorned with preserved statues and\
  \ artwork. The priest spoke to us through the use of our translator but his passion\
  \ transcended language. Hope burned bright inside the church. \nBack in the mountains\
  \ of Solol\xE1, we were asked to speak to the Guatemalan people. In my presentation,\
  \ I used the phrase, \u201CIn America, we believe\u2026\u201D The translator stopped.\
  \ \nWhen I met his eyes with confusion he explained, \u201CThey will not understand\
  \ what you mean when you say \u2018America\u2019 because they also believe they\
  \ live in America.\u201D \nI stumbled through the rest of my speech but that moment\
  \ had changed me. Within the arbitrary lines of the United States my beliefs about\
  \ the developing world remained unexamined. During my trip, I witnessed the differences\
  \ between the United States and Guatemala and my worldview expanded. The real discovery\
  \ however was not in our differences but in our similarities. \nI witnessed the\
  \ incredible human capacity for resilience. I began to uncover the origins of passion\
  \ and circumstances that drive us towards change. The image of open hands of all\
  \ colors passing along offerings of support, connection and compassion towards those\
  \ in need comes to mind. \nCulture shock did not come until I returned to the United\
  \ States. I felt separate from the noise and rush in the airport. Though my passport\
  \ said United States citizen my feet were still keeping time with the patting of\
  \ tostadas somewhere in a Guatemalan market. I knew that I would spend the rest\
  \ of my life trying to recreate this experience. I have come to believe that within\
  \ every nation there is the capacity to uncover the beauty of the human condition,\
  \ which remains unconcealed in Guatemala."
