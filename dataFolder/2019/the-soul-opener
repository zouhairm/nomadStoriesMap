Text: "Far from being a true stepping stone in my professional life, I had a choice\
  \ to make between two boring job offers in two different cities: Sliema (Malta)\
  \ and Prague (The Czech Republic). Year-round sun or modern art?\n\nIf I am quite\
  \ a fan of modern art and its curves which always seem to tell me inspiring stories,\
  \ I still don\u2019t know, to this day, why exactly I chose Prague. Especially when\
  \ knowing I had already lived in two magnificent cities in Europe full of modern\
  \ art architecture: Brussels and Barcelona. I just felt drawn to that city I had\
  \ never set foot in, yet. Drawn to this odd feeling, as if my life was about to\
  \ change in ways I would never had imagined.\n\nHaving travelled many times before\
  \ and lived in different countries, I was quite cocky and a little \u201Cknow-it-all\u201D\
  \ when I arrived. In my defense, I had hardly met anyone who travelled as much or\
  \ more than I did, along the way. Open-minded and flexible people seemed hard to\
  \ find. Until Andrej, my soul opener.\n\nIf not having any expectations and living\
  \ abroad had quickly become my comfort zone, Andrej brought things to another level.\
  \ He was a Czech local. A real one. One of those who lived on the wrong side on\
  \ the Iron Curtain\u2026 Living in Prague for 33 years before travelling around\
  \ the world, he saw the changes occurring in his country. No museums could tell\
  \ me about this country better than he did. If he had lots to tell, I enjoyed his\
  \ local stories even more. Through his past and his eyes, I realized how we weren\u2019\
  t taught much at school. I knew what the cold war and the Iron Curtain were about.\
  \ But I quickly realized I wasn\u2019t really given the details nor their consequences.\n\
  \nAndrej ate his first kiwifruit at age 21 when I would have the luxury to eat some\
  \ for breakfast every morning during my childhood. He grew up starving in the streets,\
  \ feeding on bread \u2013 one of the only things citizens could find in the almost-empty\
  \ supermarkets because of the lack of supplying. What amazed me the most about him\
  \ was that despite his somber and sorrowful past, he was a content man. His heartbreaking\
  \ childhood contrasted greatly with the enthusiasm and positive energy he would\
  \ put out daily. He would always smile and tell amazing stories, gently introducing\
  \ me to Prague\u2019s fascinating mindset and past. And how much they were crazy\
  \ about winter sports and nature.\n\nAlways delighted to be in his company, not\
  \ only to get to know places such as Letna and learn the connotation it had, but\
  \ to understand the Czech culture through his eyes and experiences. For the first\
  \ time in my life, I felt connected to a city and its cultural past. Especially\
  \ when I first set foot in the old town. A strange and very intense feeling filled\
  \ me up as I was walking through the pebbled streets. While passing by the old clock\
  \ and heading to the Castle, the colorful buildings and narrow streets made me feel\
  \ as if I belonged in Kafka\u2019s city.\n\nIt took me two weeks to find a crazy\
  \ expensive flat share with a hippy-dippy, three weeks to be able to say \u201C\
  na shledanou\u201D (goodbye) and four weeks to meet incredible people who very quickly\
  \ became my greatest friends. Never would I had imagined spending my evenings in\
  \ Kasarna Karlin\u2019s while sipping the best vanilla lemonade in the world in\
  \ great company. Nor had I imagined clubbing in Ankali on Fridays as if I were twenty\
  \ again or strolling across Charles\u2019 Bridge when the crowd had fled the scene,\
  \ giving the locals some air to enjoy this calm, peaceful and historical city.\n\
  \nAlthough I was a foreigner who didn\u2019t speak the language, I still felt like\
  \ my soul belonged to this city. And, today, this feeling hasn\u2019t changed one\
  \ bit. I would do it all again."
