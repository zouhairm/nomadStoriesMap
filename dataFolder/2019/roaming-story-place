Text: "The journey Since we were in high school and I am fond of travel and travel\
  \ between Iraqi cities, especially in the countryside and tourism areas in northern\
  \ Iraq, Kurdistan and the beautiful southern marshes, as it was my favorite hobbies\
  \ besides collecting stamps, correspondence, journalism and writing, Arab travelers\
  \ such as (Ibn Battuta and Idrissi and Ahmed Ibn Majid and Al-Maqdisi I also read\
  \ about the most famous orientalists such as the naturalist (Douglas Carother),\
  \ Bertram Thomas, Archibovordar and others.\n\tWashington, DC The United States\
  \ of America, a giant city with its tall buildings, some of which are more than\
  \ 400 years old. I once dreamed of visiting it. I received a grant from the Arab\
  \ Council for Social Sciences based in Beirut to visit the American Society for\
  \ Advanced Sciences (AAAS) The journey lasted 28 days, including twenty-five days\
  \ in the proceedings of the conference, and another in the wandering between Washington's\
  \ old alleys.\n\tI had a lot of observations and a lot of ideas about the big city,\
  \ the capital. The trip was full of field memos about the city's landmarks, buildings,\
  \ and buildings. I did not intend to document this journey, but it was short but\
  \ across the Atlantic Ocean where its hard path (Erbil-Istanbul-Washington) was\
  \ fun Between science and tourism sometimes between geography and history and the\
  \ press at other times.\n\n\tI was impressed by the visit to the field where the\
  \ spatial and functional description of the city with a geographical view of the\
  \ planning of the city and its services and ways to integrate with its inhabitants\
  \ who recite from different races from the corners of the African and Asian world,\
  \ documented by the photos of the traveler will document the trip on the grounds\
  \ that the picture speaks as The map is a thousand words.\n\tOn my trip to Washington,\
  \ where the city of calm is sometimes at night, and dressed in a hustle and bustle\
  \ during the day, the month of February was chilled with ice showers the size of\
  \ small balls and other medium that falls between early morning or evening silent,\
  \ describing the events of the conference in the halls and meeting and the sweetness\
  \ of victory amid Hot applause from the audience of researchers from the world.\n\
  \tWashington is the federal capital of the United States of America. On July 16,\
  \ 1790, the US Congress approved the creation of a permanent national capital as\
  \ approved by the US Constitution. Washington DC (officially: the Columbia sector,\
  \ referred to as DC, or simply, DC) is the federal capital of the United States\
  \ of America On July 16, 1790, the US Congress approved The establishment of a permanent\
  \ national capital, as approved by the US Constitution, required the establishment\
  \ of a federal sector directly under the control of the federal government and not\
  \ following any of the states of America\n\tAt 11pm another taxi was stopped by\
  \ an elderly Indian woman in the fall of the seventies. That is the driver, excuse\
  \ me. I am a strange visitor from the city. Will you take me to this address, smiling?\
  \ A man there is a daily killing of the people he said in Hasret and he is hurting,\
  \ he said this is the address of 13 th St.3305, 13th Street, Building No. 3305 in\
  \ Columbia Heights. I moved to the place of residence on Street 13, a two-story\
  \ house building with excellent rooms and Diplomatic Management like any other housing\
  \ in Washington with a secret entry number 3305 which is the same building number.\
  \ He opens the door to you. He is not authorized even to know you personally because\
  \ he will expose himself under the law and the security breach. When you go to America,\
  \ do not hesitate to ask anyone about anything you do not know or need help with.\
  \ They are very friendly people and have no problem. With your help and continued\
  \ to ask until you get the answer that helps you. In order to get their help, try\
  \ to be a permanent smile because you are not in your eastern country - Arab - you\
  \ are there between nature and faces tolerant Vergok to smile and be friendly with\
