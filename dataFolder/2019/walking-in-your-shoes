Text: "He was a guide, as was his brother. His father was a porter, who made his way\
  \ up and down Mount Rinjani daily \u2014 heavy baskets of amenities in tow, with\
  \ only slippers protecting his feet from the rugged terrain. \n\nHis own shoes were\
  \ a gift from a traveller. They were worn-out from years of use, with gaping holes\
  \ that told stories of the long journeys they'd been on. \n\nHis name was Shu, and\
  \ we had been trudging upwards \u2014 under his guidance \u2014 for three days.\
  \ Laden with just a small bag he had led us from base camp, as we struggled with\
  \ our Northface backpacks, our Timberland hiking shoes, our dreams of checking this\
  \ mother of Indonesian mountains off our bucket lists. \n\nAs we ascended the mountain,\
  \ the forest and the other hikers disappeared behind us and turned miniature in\
  \ the distance. \n\nI wondered if Shu was so at home in the mountains that he was\
  \ no longer impressed by Mount Rinjani\u2019s beauty. Walking precariously on ridge\
  \ lines and observing the volcanic crater spewing out ash was his daily grind. For\
  \ city-dwellers like us, it was a new, different high; a trek through a foreign\
  \ landscape.\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s no way back down even if you\u2019re tired\u2026\
  \ you\u2019ve got to just keep going,\u201D my companion Isaac told me. Blisters\
  \ had formed on skin chafing against the inside of my boots; one of my toenails\
  \ was bruised dark-blue. \n\nWhat kept me walking on was Shu\u2019s casual energy.\
  \ He whistled as he walked through the dense foliage, with the familiarity of a\
  \ city dweller crossing the street. \n\nOnwards and upwards and onwards we climbed,\
  \ until we saw a glimpse of the clearing. The basecamp for the night. The crater.\n\
  \nWe set up camp in our tents, and watched the stars fill the night sky. Shu gathered\
  \ broken twigs and plastic bottles to start a fire.\n\nAt 1AM, we heard the rustle\
  \ of tents being opened. Headlamps on and windbreakers over our shoulders, we started\
  \ the gruelling ascent to the summit.\n\nVolcanic terrain made it difficult to progress\
  \ \u2014 with every step, our feet sank into black sand. Shu never left our sides\
  \ as we staggered forward, the sunrise threatening to peek through the clouds. All\
  \ I could do was focus on the crunch of Shu\u2019s footsteps, to distract myself\
  \ with a comforting rhythm. Right, left. Right, left. \n\n5AM \u2014 and a thousand\
  \ steps later \u2014we made the summit: Steel-blue sky; rolling clouds; alpine air\
  \ that had me gasping like a swimmer breaking the water\u2019s surface. The clouds\
  \ parted to reveal a magnificent view of the forest below.  Isaac and I stayed at\
  \ the cliff edge, taking in our accomplishment in disbelief. \n\nThe guides said\
  \ their hellos and lit hand-rolled cigarettes, with a habit that bordered on ritual.\
  \ It was as if peaking a mountain\u2019s summit was just another day at work. Instead\
  \ of skyscrapers, the skyline they called home was this vast landscape of wildlife\
  \ and sunshine.\n\nThe journey down was punctuated with light-hearted conversations\
  \ between the three of us. At that point, I had given up on my sore feet and switched\
  \ to slippers. We stopped for meal breaks, where Shu would whip instant noodles\
  \ out of his bag, always insisting that we eat first. \n\nDuring these intervals,\
  \ we were relieved to air our shoes, and rest our feet. \n\n\u201CYour shoes, Shu\u201D\
  , Isaac pointed out. \u201CYou need new ones!\u201D\n\n\u201CNo need, can use! Long\
  \ walk. Very good.\u201D Shu replied casually.\n\nWhen we returned to the foot of\
  \ the mountain, it was difficult to say our goodbyes \u2014 to the mountain that\
  \ provided us with a form of solace, and to Shu\u2019s company. He had referred\
  \ to us as his brother and sister, and for a while, it felt that way.\n\nWe were\
  \ going home with memories of a lifetime, while Shu would continue with another\
  \ trip in a few days. While we were merely transient in his life, I hoped that,\
  \ in his interactions with many other travellers, he would remember us. \n\nBut\
  \ the mountains were calling, and he had to go. As we watched him walk away, my\
  \ eyes focused on his feet, and I wished I could have bought him new shoes."
