Text: "I was told repeatedly that it was too cold to go swimming in April by Italian\
  \ locals. Coming from a colder climate, I'm accustomed to swimming in water that\
  \ never really gets \"warm\", like the Mediterranean will in late summer. My friend\
  \ had told me about a small, local beach spot outside of Bari in the south-eastern\
  \ Italian region of Puglia. \n\"Want to come with me tomorrow?\" I asked him.\n\"\
  Absolutamente no \u2013 troppo freddo\" (Absolutely not \u2013\_too cold). He exclaimed\
  \ dramatically. I couldn't help but notice that he was wearing a heavy sweater and\
  \ jeans, while I shorts and flip-flops. I should have already known the answer to\
  \ my question.\n\"I'll go alone,\" I told myself. \"But what about my stuff? I can't\
  \ just leave my phone on the beach. It's going to get stolen.\"\nThe more I thought\
  \ about leaving my phone at my AirBNB, the more I relished at the idea of disconnecting\
  \ from technology for a day. \nI never go anywhere without my phone. While traveling,\
  \ my phone is my calendar, watch, journal, camera, source of information, GPS, and\
  \ a source of constant connection to my friends and family. Losing it or having\
  \ it stolen while abroad would be devastating.\nEarlier in the year, I woke up one\
  \ morning in a Chinese hospital, completely unaware of why or how I had ended up\
  \ there. My phone was dead. My Chinese language skills were poor, and I felt so\
  \ stranded and scared without my phone to direct me back to my hotel. I made do\
  \ \u2013\_with nothing more than luck and circumstance. \nI was apprehensive that\
  \ a similar emergency may present itself. Yet, the temptation to disconnect grew\
  \ stronger. I set aside my apprehensions and packed a daypack for the beach. I locked\
  \ the door of my AirBNB in Bari and peered at my cellphone sitting on the table,\
  \ through the door's barred windows. \nWith a feeling that I had forgotten to attach\
  \ my arm to my shoulder when I woke up in the morning, I headed towards the train\
  \ station. This feeling confirmed I had made the right call. Maybe a cell phone\
  \ isn't a necessity, rather an addiction masqueraded as a friend. All addictions\
  \ seem necessary until you can gain some perspective. \nMy mind flashed back to\
  \ February when I visited a gorgeous, Balinese waterfall. Everyone around me was\
  \ taking endless selfies and pictures. I watched as they gazed in wonder at the\
  \ photos of this natural beauty, while the real-life waterfall stood only a few\
  \ meters from them. \"Don't be like them. Enjoy the moment,\" I told myself. \"\
  Say a prayer of thanks for being here before this beautiful work of art nature has\
  \ created.\"\nI remembered this moment when I stepped off the train and headed to\
  \ the beach. It was about 23 degrees Celsius that day, warm enough for me; but the\
  \ crystal, clear water was cold. After an hour swimming at the beach, I walked along\
  \ the cliff-sidewalks and enjoyed the views. These views were for my eyes only on\
  \ that day, not for a future nostalgic me, nor for my Instagram followers. I soaked\
  \ in the horizon's beauty that lay before my eyes.\nMy return train arrived back\
  \ in Bari around 6PM. When I exited the train station, I began itching to hurry\
  \ back and check my phone. It was in this moment that I realized what an addictive\
  \ hold it had on my day-to-day life. When I finally arrived, I raced to unlock the\
  \ door and checked my phone. \nOne email and a few texts. That's it.\nI sighed in\
  \ relief, and the release of unlocking my phone spread throughout my body. I set\
  \ my phone down again. \nI smiled, remembering that, earlier, I had found a second,\
  \ more secluded beach. I plunged into the deep water and snorkelled, gazing at the\
  \ fish. For a moment, I wished I had brought my phone to capture a snapshot of this\
  \ secluded beach. \nBut I reminded myself again: \n\tDon't be like them. \n\tEnjoy\
  \ the moment. \n\tLive here, \n\t\t\t\tbe here. \nI took one last dive down, smiling\
  \ and saying a silent prayer of thanks."
