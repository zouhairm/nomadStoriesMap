Text: "For the first time in more than twenty days I could see colors. So far, the\
  \ big city seemed like an old movie, the \"Fernsehturm\", with more than 1207ft,\
  \ known as one of the four tallest towers of the old continent, was covered up by\
  \ clouds. \nMurals, graffiti, tattoos and colorful hairs dyed the city with joy\
  \ and a certain exoticism. On that Thursday, I had to take the yellow line to Innsbrucker\
  \ Platz, where I would meet with an old friend from childhood, for whom the german\
  \ school had opened great doors. That was not my case.  The few words I barely remembered,\
  \ I was too intimidated to even pronounce them. \"Wakstein: the one who works the\
  \ stone; Stein means stone\u201D, used to repeat my german teacher, Frederika, when\
  \ explaining the origin of my surname.\nDespite having used the underground for\
  \ more than a month, it still left me flabbergasted. The huge terminal clock marked\
  \ 10.03 and, as shown on the screen, the underground arrived right on time at the\
  \ station. For someone like me, born and raised in Argentina, to see that the time\
  \ on the screen coincided with the arrival of the underground, seemed as a work\
  \ of Copperfield.\nI waited until the people in front of me got in and sat on the\
  \ side of the window in the last car as I always do. Call it \u201Ccabala\u201D\
  \ or custom, I don\u2019t know, but there I was when I noticed with astonishment\
  \ that my seat shone more than the shoes of the man in front of me. \u201CDid they\
  \ polish each seat every time someone leaves?\u201D, I thought. \nI liked the window\
  \ seat because the german undergrounds switch from running inside the tunnel to\
  \ outside, which surprisingly felt like a show of lights:  Light, darkness, light,\
  \ darkness and so on.\nI took advantage of the hostel's Wi-Fi to download some astrology\
  \ podcasts and listened to them throughout my journeys. That day I played the episode\
  \ called: \u201Cmoon in Libra\u201D. I always dreamt of, like in a carousel, do\
  \ the full round trips repeatedly. I couldn\u2019t say why but this ride took me\
  \ to a place of introspection that I never achieved, not even in yoga classes or\
  \ meditation.\nIn a long interval of darkness, a sound from the outside entered\
  \ my ears as if it was musicalizing my venture. I don\u2019t usually get distracted\
  \ by what happens around me but at that moment, I felt compelled to turn down the\
  \ volume and tried to guess where that music came from.\nThe harmony sounded familiar,\
  \ for a moment I thought it was a Queen acoustic or an Oasis instrumental. But no,\
  \ it was a classic melody and I couldn\u2019t let myself out of that underground\
  \ without figuring out that piece. Soon, I began to feel the music closer and closer,\
  \ as if I were in a fairy tale. I had reached such a level of detachment, I doubted\
  \ if I was still alive.\nAs I opened my eyes, there he was. An old man, around his\
  \ 70s, gray hair,long beard, with a smile that showed more than a million teeth.\
  \ He played the clarinet which, to me, was more common in Germany than Argentina,\
  \ where musicians play mostly the guitar.\nHe winked at me, he must have noticed\
  \ my amazement instantly. I heard a voice from the loudspeakers: \"N\xE4chster Halt\
  \ InnsbruckerPlatz\", which I knew, after so many days in the city, meant \"next\
  \ stop\". Eagerly, I began to search my pockets for coins. I had some euros mixed\
  \ with argentinian pesos and I still had trouble understanding their values.\nAlmost\
  \ arriving at the station I managed to find two euros. \u201CTwo euros, 90 argentinian\
  \ pesos\u201D, I thought quickly, but didn\u2019t hesitate in putting them in his\
  \ hat. He smiled with his million teeth and gave me his personal card. I left with\
  \ a mixed feeling of joy, curiosity and admiration. It seemed as if I had traveled\
  \ in time, his face took me to childhood memories, I couldn\u2019t understand why.\n\
  The city was gray again. As I sat down to wait for my old friend, I glanced at his\
  \ card again and read \"IOSL Wakstein, argentinischer musiker\"."
