Text: "Sometimes I do believe that I live in a surreal Serbian movie. If not a Serbian,\
  \ at least one of those crazy movies in which you say to yourself, \u2018Yeah, surely,\
  \ it couldn\u2019t be\u2019.\n\tLet me tell you one thing: it could be! Especially\
  \ in days like this, when you sink into your miserable thoughts, warding off the\
  \ end of happiness, which to me equates with an end of a trip, when the journey\u2019\
  s destination is bound to be an undesirable one. The day when we had to wait until\
  \ 8:05 pm and catch the night train to Prague. \n\tThe weather forecast was not\
  \ promising. Paris truly had a plan for us and didn\u2019t want to get rid of its\
  \ travelers that easily. We were planning to spend the whole day in the Louvre,\
  \ but eventually agreed on visiting Pere Lachaise. We bid farewell to our host Arno\
  \ and went down the stairs. At the entrance to the neighbouring building, however,\
  \ a woman started yelling at us. We somehow understood that we were not allowed\
  \ to go out, but the reason for that remained a secret. At that moment, through\
  \ the matt glass wall, I saw the silhouette of a strapping man, and I don\u2019\
  t know why, but the first thing I could think of, was: \u2018Hey, look, he looks\
  \ like Gerard Depardieu!\u2019. I said that aloud, and my friend K. patting me on\
  \ the shoulder, replied: \u2018That\u2019s him, alright? But don\u2019t get overexcited\
  \ and by any means, do not approach him, as we don\u2019t want to get in trouble\u2019\
  .  \n\tOn our way to the metro station I was thinking, \u2018Such an unusual start\
  \ of the day!\u2019\n\tIn the subway we were once again surprised. As we were counting\
  \ the stops carefully (as none of us could speak French and even understand the\
  \ announcements), trying to balance over the support of a half-broken seat, loaded\
  \ with heavy bags and food packs in hands, a guy approached us and asked: \u2018\
  Where are you from?\u2019, and the answer, \u2018From Burgas\u2019. He was a Bulgarian\
  \ who sells paintings on a street named Rivoli. He told us we could visit him and\
  \ go to cafe Angelina on the same street, where we could enjoy the most delicious\
  \ Belgian hot chocolate in Paris. Convincing enough. When we shared with him our\
  \ plans to go to the grave of Edith Piaf, he supposed he could join in. \n\tImagine\
  \ you have ever had a dream which seemed to you impossible, but no matter how impossible\
  \ and ambiguous it might be, you kept on dreaming and visualizing that this dream\
  \ could find its way and come true. Now imagine your dream became true. What would\
  \ you do? Well, I\u2019m not a partaker. I\u2019m an observer. When I experience\
  \ or see something beautiful I don\u2019t sink into it. No, I swim to the surface\
  \ and then take a look down. I let the water bend the image and then I capture it.\
  \ This time, however, I cheated on myself. \u2018Let\u2019s hide in one of the family\
  \ cemeteries and pray for more rain just the ancient Egyptians did centuries ago\u2019\
  , says my friend. And here we are, three Bulgarians praying for more rain in a semi-locked\
  \ cemetery,  getting soaked in the rain.   \n\tTo tell you the truth, whenever I\
  \ wish something for myself and my loved ones, I always wish for health, love, and\
  \ all these vague words that don\u2019t indicate what is that you really want. Now,\
  \ I have a dream. I want to live on Rivoli street for a while, in a room with a\
  \ tiny window, looking at the stars, with a big balcony and a staircase to the rooftop.\
  \ I want to have a black cat. I want to live with a person who works at the train\
  \ station and collects passangers\u2019 tickets, because he still can\u2019t figure\
  \ out where to go next, or someone who cannot speak French at all, so we can struggle\
  \ together. I consider this too ambitious for a dream, but that\u2019s how dreams\
  \ work. Now everytime when I blow the candles out, throw coins into fountains, and\
  \ see a shooting star, I will have a dream for them to fulfill."
