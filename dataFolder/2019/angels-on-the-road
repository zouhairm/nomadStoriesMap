Text: "I decided to go on an adventure with my best friend. We made that decision\
  \ in less than a week, just because sometimes you need to go with the flow.\nSo\
  \ we took a plane to the other side of the world without knowing anything. We just\
  \ knew that i was gonna have the craziest adventure and  we weren't even sure what\
  \ to expect.\n\nWe lived day by day  as backpackers in India.  Two 18 year old girls\
  \ going every 2 days to a different city. We traveled in train, airplane, local\
  \ bus. We experienced everything.\nBy half of our trip we had almost no money left\
  \ and a big roadtrip by train ahead.\nWe just wanted to get to our next destination,\
  \ and find a way to make our trip work because we couldn\u2019t even afford a bottle\
  \ of water by that moment.\nEverything was coming out a little bit wrong, our train\
  \ got delayed 4 hours, we didn\u2019t understood the signs and there was nobody\
  \ at the train station. \nThere we were, all alone, really hungry just walking around,\
  \ as if the right answers would appear in our mind somehow.\nWe were exploring for\
  \ a while and when we went back to our spot  a little angel appeared.\nThere was\
  \ this girl sitting quietly on a bench, when she saw us coming her way she smiled\
  \ and it felt so peaceful, seeing her made us feel like everything was gonna be\
  \ alright somehow.\nAnd that\u2019s how we made a friend.\nWe met Samishka, a girl\
  \ our age who studied in Delhi and was on her way home, casually on the same train\
  \ as us.\nWe learned so much with her. She taught us hindi, she gave us her food\
  \ even though we never asked for it (but we really thanked her because we were starving),\
  \ she made us feel like home even though we were 3 people stuck on the loneliest\
  \ train station you could find.\nUp in the train there were also this little angels\
  \ by our side. They were an indian couple having meal on the road and they looked\
  \ at our way and probably saw two lost girls looking their way. They offered us\
  \ food and water, just as an act of kindness.\n That whole day we survived just\
  \ by the kindness of people. It\u2019s funny how before we went on this trip everyone\
  \ was telling us how careful we had to be and  how it wasn\u2019t safe to talk to\
  \ strangers. I don\u2019t like to live afraid, i like to live my life believing\
  \ that there is still love and amazment everywhere and in everyone.\nIt\u2019s incredible\
  \ what people can teach you just with little acts that they may not even notice\
  \ that their doing.\nAs an 18 year old girl traveling all alone for the first time\
  \ i knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but somehow everything worked out and\
  \ angels were near me at every moment, and by angels i refer to people who helped\
  \ us, taught us, made us come home with the belief that good people is still everywhere\
  \ and you just have to hold on to that thought in order to find them. You can\u2019\
  t live with fear your hole life, sometimes you just have to take the leap and go\
  \ further, you never know what amazing things life can bring you."
