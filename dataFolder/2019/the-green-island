Text: "It was several minutes into our conversation, characterized by friendly introductions\
  \ and conventional small-talk, that I recognized Antero as a member of my family.\
  \ I knew before meeting that Antero was my grandmother\u2019s cousin, but there\u2019\
  s a difference between knowing a fact and seeing it for yourself. I saw the truth\
  \ in his eyes, shaped the same as my own and creased at the edges, smiling at me\
  \ above the steaming twin cups of espresso set on the table before us. This was\
  \ my final hour in Ponte Delgada, S\xE3o Miguel, the capital city of the Azores\
  \ archipelago of Portugal. One hour left to appreciate the origin of my family.\n\
  \nI arrived in Ponte Delgada from California four days before meeting Antero. As\
  \ I settled into my hotel room, my father sent a message that read:\n\nG-ma\u2019\
  s cousin still lives on the island. Do you want me to email him your #?\n\nMy trip\
  \ was the product of serendipity. I had time off from work, chanced upon a $205\
  \ round-trip ticket from California to S\xE3o Miguel, and learned that my friend,\
  \ Max from Munich, would also be visiting the island. I ignored my father and texted\
  \ Max instead, asking to meet at Marina Pero de Teive across the street from my\
  \ hotel.\n\nWe spent the next two days in his rented Opel Corsa, driving the length\
  \ of S\xE3o Miguel\u2019s winding roads five times over. We began in Furnas, a civil\
  \ parish nestled in the emboldened green hills of Povoa\xE7\xE3o. Antero later explained\
  \ that the original settlers of the island found a lake at the center of a volcanic\
  \ crater. Over time, the lake was absorbed by the earth and Furnas was founded in\
  \ its place. A series of hot springs, or caldeiras, characterize the area, heated\
  \ by volcanic heat deep beneath the earth.\n\nMax and I visited the caldeira at\
  \ Parque Terra Nostra for six euros each. We swam in the rust-colored, sulfur-scented\
  \ water for nearly an hour, but knew nothing about the spring\u2019s significance\
  \ to Furnas.\n\nNext, we visited Boca do Inferno, a lookout point that rises in\
  \ the hills above a pair of picturesque lakes, one blue and one green, known as\
  \ Lagoa das Sete Cidades. When I told Antero about my visit to Boca do Inferno,\
  \ he shared with me the legend of Lagoa das Sete Cidades. Once upon a time, a shepherd\
  \ fell in love with a princess. He asked the king for her hand in marriage, but\
  \ the king refused his request. On their final night together, the shepherd and\
  \ the princess held one another close, crying. Their tears fell and created twin\
  \ lakes the color of their eyes: blue for the shepherd and green for the princess.\n\
  \nMax departed the island and spent my third day alone, wandering Ponte Delgada\
  \ by foot. At the seawall bordering the marina, I discovered fantastic graffiti\
  \ detailing anthropomorphized sea creatures angling and trawling from the deck of\
  \ a great ship. I visited Igreja Matriz de S\xE3o Sebasti\xE3o, an historic black-and-white\
  \ church constructed from volcanic rock.\n\nAt the end of my day, I presented my\
  \ debit card to a bartender who smiled and said, \u201Cmaw-neesh.\u201D I smiled\
  \ back, confused, and he repeated himself, pointing at his chest. It was when he\
  \ pointed to my surname on the card, \u201CMoniz,\u201D that I finally understood:\
  \ we shared a name. \u201CAh, yes! Descuple-me,\u201D I said. The bartender smiled\
  \ again, nodding silently. The action left me awash in a sudden wave of sadness:\
  \ we shared a name, but not a language.\n\nMy family prides itself as American,\
  \ but not Portuguese-American. Unlike other multicultural American identities, Portuguese\
  \ tends to be forgotten. Perhaps it\u2019s a result of our collective escape from\
  \ the fascist regime of Estado Novo. Regardless, a piece of who we are has been\
  \ lost, exchanged in favor of a generically-branded identity. The correct pronunciation\
  \ of my surname was lost through Americanization, replaced with the more palatable\
  \ \u201CMoe-neez.\u201D\n\nThat night, I contacted Antero directly. We met the next\
  \ morning at a caf\xE9 close to the marina; Antero immediately asked for a photo\
  \ together. In our brief hour together, I learned as much as I could of S\xE3o Miguel,\
  \ Antero, and his family.\n\nMy family."
