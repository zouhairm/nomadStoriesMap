Text: "Sometimes there\u2019s not enough room inside me to remember certain things.\
  \ Sometimes my stomach bloats at the thought of the black dog caught underneath\
  \ the wheels of the bus from Puerto Princesa to El Nido and everything sounds of\
  \ the screams of the children who ran after the bus. I remember the silence inside\
  \ the recklessly moving vehicle as it slightly bumped against the running mass that\
  \ was the black dog. Silence except for the loud \u201CFUCK\u201D that erupted from\
  \ my throat, and then there was silence again. Or maybe I didn\u2019t curse out\
  \ loud \u2013 maybe it was only in my mind.  \n\nThe driver pulled over and checked\
  \ the front of the bus. He was a short man with oily hair parted sideways. He gave\
  \ me discount on the bus tickets and said he likes his girls young and fair-skinned.\
  \ He said something to his friend in Filipino and when they looked at me they laughed\
  \ as if there their throats were clogged with dirt. He gave me the front seat and\
  \ although I didn\u2019t want to sit right next to him I was too tired to be ungrateful\
  \ for the extra leg room. \n\nA piece of the registration plate fell off when we\
  \ hit the dog. While the driver was examining the damage to the bus I turned sideways\
  \ and felt sick as I saw the sunset through the rear view mirror. It was red and\
  \ beautiful. It was difficult to believe that a miracle could exist to close by\
  \ the dying animal. I remember hoping the sunset and it\u2019s warm hued flames\
  \ were the last thing the dog saw before it died but thinking back to it now, the\
  \ sky was like a eulogy for the life of the dog that ended underneath those hasty\
  \ wheels. Where were we rushing to? No one was in a hurry. \n\nWhenever we stopped\
  \ for a break, the driver was the one who took the longest to finish smoking his\
  \ cigarette. I thought maybe he was driving so carelessly because he was impatient\
  \ to get to a place where he could stop. \n\nHe turned the bus around and drove\
  \ back to the spot where he hit the dog. My feet felt too big for my body and I\
  \ didn\u2019t know what to do with my hands. I was scared to look at the road; I\
  \ didn\u2019t want to see the dead dog. But I looked anyway and saw no dead dog.\
  \ Next to the road the children stood barefoot looking at the driver with quiet\
  \ loathe. He lit up a cigarette and picked up the missing piece of metal he came\
  \ back for. He took only one drag from his cigarette and stepped on it when he threw\
  \ it on the ground. \n\nWhile he got back in the bus, I saw the black dog limp up\
  \ the road side hill. The bus was mute as the children were watching the dog limp\
  \ and we were watching the children watching the dog and the driver. The driver\
  \ who came back but ignored the children and the limping dog with its muddy matted\
  \ hair where black fur parted on its hind legs. There was blood but the dog didn\u2019\
  t die. The dog didn\u2019t die. The dog didn\u2019t die. \n\nThe rest of the drive\
  \ was quiet except for the unnecessary honks whenever a dog or child ran across\
  \ the road as though the driver wanted to redeem himself for not granting the black\
  \ dog the same warning. \n\nThe last time we stopped for petrol before arriving\
  \ in El Nido I saw the driver motion a cross across his chest. I didn't expect a\
  \ man capable of checking on his vehicle before checking on the dog he hit also\
  \ to be a man capable of prayer. \n\nI wondered if he would had to pay for the damage\
  \ to the front of the bus."
