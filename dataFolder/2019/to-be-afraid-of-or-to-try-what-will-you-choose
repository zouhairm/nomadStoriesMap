Text: "Have you ever wondered how many times a day you fight for your dream?\nAmerica\
  \ has always been my dream. From the 8th grade I dreamed that I would definitely\
  \ visit there once. Visa, endless interviews, jim-jams, 8 thousand kilometers separated\
  \ me from my first independent trip. And then I hear the cherished verdict: your\
  \ visa is approved. Just think about it! I just turned 18, have never been abroad\
  \ before, and there is Moscow-New York ticket on my hands. My heart never seemed\
  \ to beat so often.\nSuitcases, airports, sleepless days. I see \xABWelcome to New\
  \ York\xBB. My heart beats even faster. What do all these people say? My mind had\
  \ not yet been converted to the American one, but I already liked the smell of donuts\
  \ and freshly brewed coffee at the airport. The airport doors open and I see a famous\
  \ yellow cab, which I saw only in the movies, incredible skyscrapers, and most importantly,\
  \ I feel the smell of freedom. Freedom to travel. Freedom to be yourself. I tell\
  \ the taxi driver to take me to Times Square. I have never seen this in my life.\
  \ Life is bubbling around me. Streets with famous boutiques of Chanel and Prada,\
  \ a huge M&M world , crazy billboards\u2026 I turn around again and again, lifting\
  \ my head to the top, and there again endless majestic skyscrapers. Life in New\
  \ York is boiling, spinning, and I became a part of it. Crowds of people around\
  \ are enthusiastically shouting, dancing, singing, kissing, swearing, breaking up.\
  \ New York lives every second. I immediately run to the shop with hot dogs to taste\
  \ the American dream. Delicious as in the picture. In 20 minutes I had time to get\
  \ lost and find the right way again. New York is unreal. Then I feel the smell of\
  \ rot. It turns out that I turn into a very poor slum area. The homeless sleep here\
  \ right on the street, and someone evilly looks back at me . My heart is ready to\
  \ jump out of fear. The City of contrast. Just 7 minutes ago, there was a carnival\
  \ here, and now I see a flock of rats running along the sewer tile, and the poor\
  \ old man is turning from side to side to quench the feeling of hunger. I get into\
  \ a taxi and drive on. The taxi driver, by the way, is very polite and tell a lot\
  \ of interesting places where I should go. And here I am taking the ferry to the\
  \ Statue of Liberty. The wind blows my hair and I can taste it. The Statue of Liberty\
  \ seemed to me so big in the pictures at school, and now, I see it in front of me.\
  \ Small, but graceful and impressive. Worth to see and fly 9 hours in the air. An\
  \ American started a conversation with me, telling that this was his ninth trip\
  \ on this ferry, and each time seemed to be the first. His smile that does not leave\
  \ the face catches me and I believe him. It is difficult not to fall in love feeling\
  \ such a freedom. New York takes a lot of energy and I'm terribly hungry. I would\
  \ have had time to try a real American burger later, so I go to the first restaurant\
  \ and order a bagel. Since then it has become my favorite breakfast and a great\
  \ motivation to run in the morning. Then the waiter brings me a slice of pizza,\
  \ and this is probably the most cheesy pizza in my life. Ah, Americans are able\
  \ to make the greatest pizza and fast food.\nOf course, I knew about the Empire\
  \ State Building. But I also knew that I am terribly afraid of heights. So New York\
  \ made me love it.  Taking the elevator to the top floor of this building, I simply\
  \ forgot what it means to be afraid of heights. People look like ants, cars like\
  \ toys from Lego - New York from a bird's eye seems completely different. Powerful,\
  \ but at the same time so vulnerable. Only skyscrapers save him. Breathtaking. When\
  \ I went downstairs, I noticed that people were returning back in silence. Probably\
  \ under the impression of what they saw. Although I already understood that Americans\
  \ are still lovers to chat. I want to end my day with coffee in Brooklyn. How good\
  \ is American coffee! And the roads in America are so smooth that it\u2019s not\
  \ scary to ride with him in a taxi and think that it will spill. In general, I fought\
  \ for this day with all my might, dreamed of it and New York met me the way I could\
  \ not imagine. And the best part is that I still have 3 months to travel around\
  \ America. And how many times a day do you fight for your dream?"
