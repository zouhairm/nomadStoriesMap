Text: "She is a beautiful mature lady: Is the mosaic of a mosaic on a yellow topaz\
  \ wall wrought balconies crossed by hanging panties, kitchen towels and colorful\
  \ skirts.\nSun and sea salt tanned white skin; Moorish eyes and Roman profile, long\
  \ auburn hair. The figure keeps intact its softing curves, not in vain has been\
  \ years going uphill and downhill thru long steep stairs and narrow cobbledstone\
  \ streets. \nNostalgic lover; inveterate romantic anchored in the homesickness of\
  \ the glorious past with that lover of the Amazons. He has a dagger stuck in his\
  \ soul that sounds like fado and consoles herself with Port; for  lazi afternoons\
  \ Ginjinha; the cherries of remembrance, one of many that left an old lover of the\
  \ Middle East.\nShe likes to receive some afternoons smoking smoothly  at the doors\
  \ of a small house in the neighborhood of Alafama, waiting for the guitarist to\
  \ finish the \u201Cround of the hat\u201D between in the streets around Pla\xE7\
  a do Rosio. After been in all the corners of Baixa finally comes the frail fadista\
  \ with the guitar in arms, almost faint after playing all day, but for a propper\
  \  finish, we  bursting in the stairs of the colorful alley of forged balconys full\
  \ of clotheslines; the neighbors accompany their last ardent sorrow night.\nShe\
  \ doesn\xB4t cook, but knows where to get nice meales. At one o\xB4clock she goes\
  \ downhill to Gra\xE7a to eat the dish of the day in the house of  the famale cook,\
  \ the kind one with cobbledstone floor patio and in the  centered a china fig tree\
  \ taht gives shade to the diners that want to taste home made food. \nOnly once\
  \  she cooked for me, was after our getaway to the Olhao-Algarve market. She deeply\
  \ enjoy the highway landscape from Lisbon; a journey of two and a half hours that\
  \ also served to clear my mind. On the way back we carried the trunk with baskets\
  \ full of tomatoes, potatoes, onions, peppers, green beans, olives, sausages, dried\
  \ sausages, peaches, figs, cherries, oranges and grapes. We had roasted sardines\
  \ and rice for lunch, while watching the gentle waves rocking the fishermen boats.\
  \ The murmur of the waves and the market hulk behaind us enraptured us. The wind\
  \ was blowing nicely cool under that sun of 28 C. \nThe payment days she goes to\
  \ the market of Ribeira to binge, followed by a shopping walk to Chiado, looking\
  \ for some cute robe to wear at night. \nA long night that injects youth. First,\
  \ drinks Sagres in different bars in Barrio Alto sorounded by Erasmus studients.Later\
  \ on she gets stronger drinks at a nice club, like Pensao Amor; I met her there;\
  \ she was talking about cork and the nostalgia that the country economy carries\
  \ too.\nI wanted to visit Sintra. She told me taht when she wants to get up her\
  \ mood, she visits Sintra. The Quintas, palaces castles and huge summer houses of\
  \ the bourgeois class seemed to her like magical places taken from a romantic surrealist\
  \ tale. \nSunday morning we had breakfas and set off for Adraga beach, beautiful\
  \ beach surrounded by imposing cliffs, the Atlanti blue  put us in a good mood.\
  \ We made love in the beach, far away from bathers and fishermen. That reminds the\
  \ slow walks in Belem, lying on the grass devouring ourself and the buns too.\n\
  I can not stop talking about her without talking about her regular visits to the\
  \ flea market Feira da Ladra hoping to find an abandoned treasure.\nSome tiemes\
  \ when she feelt blue, she travels to Cascais only with the Pessoa papers in hand.\
  \ Only the wind dried her tears and ruffled her hair.\nIf she likes you, she will\
  \ go with you to Oporto by train,  to be your company on long walks through the\
  \ Ribeira and on a sunset in the Douro, or to an event at the Parque do Tejo, or\
  \ to visit  the MAAT  and the Oriente station to show you the vitality of the place.\n\
  You\xB4ll end in deep love, as i was just when I said goodbye by the majestic and\
  \ eternal Vasco de Gama.\nI did not understand the expression Saudade until I left.\n\
  \n\nYohali P\xE9rez Portilla."
