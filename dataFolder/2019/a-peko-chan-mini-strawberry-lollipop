Text: "Every once in awhile, you will be able to catch me smiling wistfully as I peer\
  \ into the container containing all my souvenirs and keepsakes from my recent travels.\n\
  \nIdeally, souvenirs and keepsakes should not be perishable items but there is one\
  \ that stands out above the rest - a mini strawberry lollipop featuring a popular\
  \ Japanese character named \"Peko-Chan\". \n\nI know I eventually have to eat it,\
  \ but I can't bear to do so just yet as there is a fond memory associated with it.\n\
  \nLet me share the story here with you:\n\nI was wandering along Kokusai Dori Street\
  \ at Naha City on Day 4 of my solo Okinawa trip back in January 2019 looking for\
  \ a bite to satisfy my rumbling stomach.\n\nTo mention, street food is not exactly\
  \ commonplace here in Okinawa, however - I recall in passing of a grilled skewer\
  \ snack stall called Marushin Wagyu the day before, so off I went to look for it!\n\
  \nNo communication between the owner and the customer is required as the stall operates\
  \ on a vending machine ordering system. As such, all you have to do is to pass him\
  \ your order ticket and wait for your food to be grilled before collecting it!\n\
  \nI was initially glad that I didn't have to speak as the stall was manned by a\
  \ burly and stern looking Japanese man dressed in black. And to be honest, I was\
  \ a little intimidated by him as a smile never seem to cross his face.\n\nAfter\
  \ savoring every bite of that delicious melt-in-your-mouth A4 Wagyu beef skewer\
  \ which I splurged for 1000 yen, it was time to return the used skewer back to the\
  \ stall of which, I did so - albeit gingerly.\n\nIt was then, the owner caught my\
  \ eye and gruffly beckoned me over while rummaging at the counter's drawer in front\
  \ of him.\n\nPretty sure I was looking at him quizzically with my eyes opened wide\
  \ in fear while in my head,\n- I was panicking internally and thinking, \"OH MY\
  \ GOD, DID I JUST DO SOMETHING WRONG?!\"\n\nInstead, he drew out this lollipop and\
  \ silently handed it to me. \n\nAgain, he didn't smile. And he didn't have to either.\n\
  \nThis little action and gift was enough to made me tear up at the generosity and\
  \ kind heartedness of strangers in a foreign city when you are a solo traveler.\n\
  \nSuffice to say - my heart was UTTERLY full that night. \n\nThank you Okinawa for\
  \ this wonderful memory that I will never forget!"
