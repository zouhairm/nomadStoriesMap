Text: "When most backpackers come to Thailand, most see the typical sites that Bangkok\
  \ has to offer when visiting the city, like the ornate temples, the royal palaces,\
  \ and the infamous nightlife of Khao San Road. For an authentic Thai experience,\
  \ it is also recommended to venture outside of the city to see the traditional and\
  \ more rural side of Thailand. One popular day trip outside of Bangkok is to the\
  \ Damnoen Saduak Floating Market and the Maeklong Railway Market, arguably the most\
  \ popular markets in Thailand. \n\nDamnoen Saduak is the most popular floating market\
  \ in Thailand, which is great for photo opportunities, trying new food, and catching\
  \ a glimpse of the traditional way of life. When you arrive, you board a decorated\
  \ longtail boat, floating down a maze of narrow canals, past the small wooden houses\
  \ on stilts and neighborhoods that are surrounded by water.  \n\nOnce past the residential\
  \ area, you will arrive at the market itself which is crowded with local vendors\
  \ selling their goods in small rowing boats. The real highlight of the market is\
  \ viewing the fruit, flower, and food vendors that trade directly from their small\
  \ wooden boats to another. Here you will witness vendors wearing bamboo hats, selling\
  \ various fruit, noodles, souvenirs, and even ice cream from their boats. When you\
  \ see something you want to purchase, vendors use a basket on the end of a long\
  \ wooden stick to take your money and pass you your goods! For an unique culinary\
  \ experience, pull up a plastic stool before a parked boat vendor and enjoy your\
  \ meal as you watch the organized chaos around you.\n\nNot too far from the floating\
  \ market, is the the Maeklong Railway market. This is the most visited railway market\
  \ in Thailand, which is still in operation after a hundred years. \n\nThe market\
  \ offers everything a traditional Thai market would have, but what sets it apart\
  \ from other markets is that it is located directly on working railroad tracks.\
  \ When there are no trains, you can easily forget that it\u2019s on an operating\
  \ railway line. When a train passes, vendors move their goods in an orderly but\
  \ pretty nonchalant way, as if it\u2019s something that they have done a thousand\
  \ times before.\n\nWalking through the small winding alleyways of the railway market,\
  \ you can explore the stalls to view the fresh fruits and vegetables on display,\
  \ as well as the fresh seafood, so fresh that some fish are still very much moving.\
  \  It\u2019s a very relaxed atmosphere that is until the whistle of the approaching\
  \ train breaks the sounds of the markets, and then the sellers move with a new sense\
  \ of purpose. \n\nWhen the whistle is sounded, the vendors move some of their goods,\
  \ the tracks are cleared, and vendors close their shop awnings away from the railway\
  \ tracks to make way for the oncoming train. The baskets of fruits and vegetables\
  \ are shifted just enough as to not be sliced by the metal wheels. This action is\
  \ repeated throughout the day,which is why this market is called Talad Rom Hoop\
  \ in Thai, which means the \u201Cclosing of umbrellas.\u201D When the train does\
  \ arrive, it is so close that you can reach out and touch it as it passes through\
  \ the market (not recommended!) It\u2019s an amazing sight to see because the train\
  \ goes right over some of the produce that is displayed on the ground. Surprisingly,\
  \ nothing is damaged or destroyed. As soon as the train passes, the shops are set\
  \ up again and daily routine tasks of the market resumes. The vendors are pretty\
  \ unimpressed, as they watch the train depart daily nearly eight times a day and\
  \ get no thrill of the event!  \n\nBoth of these sites would make great additions\
  \ to your stay in Bangkok and can be a fascinating insight into Thai culture! Both\
  \ markets are memorable day trips that provides lots of photo opportunities, so\
  \ dust off that Bangkok hangover and get to these unique markets!"
