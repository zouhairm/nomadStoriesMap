Text: "\u2018India?\u2019 I asked astounded. \u2018Is this India?!\u2019\n\n\u2018\
  Yes, or course!\u2019 came the answer with the widest smile I had ever seen.  \n\
  \nSomehow I had walked into India without even realizing it. The land of good karma.\
  \ The land of the enlightened. Ajanabha.\n\nRewind to earlier that morning when\
  \ the wide expanse of the almost dry Mechi River swooped below me while the huge,\
  \ flat, Mechi Bridge reached out in front of me. With my backpack nestled nicely\
  \ on my back, no one beside me, and bright sunshine all around, a feeling of complete\
  \ freedom washed over me \u2013 this is what dreamy travel days are made of! I was\
  \ leaving Nepal and heading to the city of Siliguri, on my way to Darjeeling, in\
  \ north-west India. \n\nI knew the Raniganj Immigration Check Point was just over\
  \ the bridge, and then I had to find a local bus to take me to Siliguri. Mechi Bridge\
  \ is not your normal bridge, and is traversed by locals and travellers on foot or\
  \ bicycle tuk-tuk, and of course some cows, too. It is a somewhat \u2018open\u2019\
  \ border bridging Nepal and India.\n\nWalking with a backpack, not knowing exactly\
  \ the next destination, crossing borders, finding local transport, meeting local\
  \ people \u2026 what more could any traveller want? And Nepal and India have this\
  \ in bucketfulls. One day is never the same as the next. Waking up in the morning\
  \ and not knowing who you will meet that day, what you will do, or where you will\
  \ sleep that night becomes the norm. You eventually have to switch over to \u2018\
  Indian Time\u2019 and it\u2019s amazing. And \u2026 magic \u2026 in this part of\
  \ the world, there is always magic in the air.\n\nIf I thought Nepal was crazy,\
  \ India blew my mind. And to this day, walking across Mechi Bridge is one of my\
  \ favourite travel memories. As I got closer to the other side of the bridge, the\
  \ little shops started to pop up selling everything from brightly coloured Saris\
  \ to those strange packets of crisps that are all joined together and hung in rows,\
  \ like sausages in a butcher\u2019s window, and with more and more people whizzing\
  \ around the noise and excitement levels built. \n\nI kept walking and soon reached\
  \ a crossroads. Suddenly a little blue bus screeched to a stop right in front of\
  \ me, packed with people. And when I say packed, I mean sardines! Everyone was looking\
  \ at me and I tentatively asked \u2018Siliguri?\u2019 thinking that I couldn\u2019\
  t really be in India yet. \n\nThe bus driver laughed with glee and yelled back at\
  \ me \u2018Yes, Siliguri! Come, come!\u2019. And so I checked \u2018India? Is this\
  \ India?!\u2019, and that\u2019s not a question you can ask very often! \u2018Yes,\
  \ or course\u2019 came the happy reply.\n\nI had set one foot on the bus before\
  \ I asked , puzzled, \u2018Passport? What about my passport?\u2019. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019\
  t worry!\u2019 said the bus driver with another laugh. \u2018Don't worry! Come,\
  \ come!\u2019. \n\nAs much as I love the freedom of traveling, I also know the pitfalls\
  \ of not having the right paperwork. Flashes of me being stuck in an Indian airport\
  \ trying to explain that a bus driver in Raniganj said it was OK would somehow not\
  \ cut it with New Delhi Immigration Officers. \n\nReluctantly I left the bus full\
  \ of happy people and retraced my steps back towards Mechi Bridge. Now, with fresh\
  \ eyes, I saw a little signpost that said \u2018Immigration Check Point\u2019 and\
  \ an arrow that pointed off the road. I walked down a little tree-lined path and\
  \ was greeted by a moustached man in a bamboo hut with no solid walls. He sat at\
  \ a small desk and wore an olive-green, army-type uniform, black leather shoes,\
  \ and no socks. A sleeping dog lay dutifully beside him. A cow walked slowly past\
  \ outside. I was the only person there. The kind man took my passport, checked my\
  \ visa, and gave me a stamp and a smile. \n\nI thanked the man and walked back up\
  \ to the main road. Two other travellers came walking down to me and asked \u2018\
  Are you going to India?\u2019. Now it was my turn to smile big and I replied \u2018\
  You\u2019re already here!\u2019."
