Text: "This was a tough one today. I was told before I left Jerusalem that I would\
  \ get through no problem on the way to Ramallah, but coming back, there would be\
  \ a long line at the Ramallah checkpoint to return to Jerusalem. I was on foot as\
  \ I entered the checkpoint. I went into a building and had to stand in a single\
  \ file lane that was barred and there was barbed wire above me. Two people can\u2019\
  t walk side by side in these little railed tunnels. It was much like cattle being\
  \ herded. Then we\u2019d get to the turnstile, but it locked when a certain number\
  \ of people had passed. When we got through the first turnstile, we still stood\
  \ in line for awhile. \nI saw Palestinians around me pulling out these green passport\
  \ cards. I asked a man if he spoke English and he said yes, so I asked him a million\
  \ questions and he was more than willing to share. \"Do you do this every day?\"\
  \ \"No. Maybe once a month. I\u2019m a merchant and I have business that takes me\
  \ to Jerusalem. My sisters have been granted a week-long pass to enter Jerusalem\
  \ to buy something and then we will return to Ramallah. 99% of us living in Ramallah\
  \ cannot get permission to go to Jerusalem.\" I asked him, \"Has it been this way\
  \ all of your life?\"  \"Yes,\" he replied. Adding, \"Except it was a little easier\
  \ around 1987-88. Now, it\u2019s really difficult. I\u2019m never allowed to drive\
  \ my car there and it would only take 10 minutes. Instead, I have to go through\
  \ this, then take a bus. How is that any good for me?\" It was his turn to ask the\
  \ questions. \"Where are you from?\" I replied, for some reason with a sense of\
  \ guilt, \"America.\" He said, \"Welcome.!\" (EVERYONE says that. They LOVE Americans,\
  \ they just don't like our government. And they're wise enough to know the difference.)\
  \ \nI didn\u2019t take any pictures because I was stunned upon entering that railed\
  \ single line\u2026I couldn\u2019t believe it and I just thought of all of us who\
  \ know freedom (of thought, of religion, of movement) and I was seriously struck\
  \ numb at this process. I think he could see on my face, my disbelief and quiet\
  \ outrage. And that\u2019s why he was willing to explain it all to me. When you\
  \ walk through these checkpoints, you can \u2018feel\u2019 a second-class level\
  \ of being human that Palestinians feel every day of their lives."
