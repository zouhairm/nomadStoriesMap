Text: "The World Cup stadium experience is like an ornate ice sculpture specially\
  \ prepared for a glamorous event. Except it turns out the sculpture wasn\u2019t\
  \ carved by hand. It was poured into a plastic mold. And it\u2019s not even a solid\
  \ block, but a hollow-centered shell designed to reduce the time and expense of\
  \ freezing. The genesis of the piece wasn\u2019t born from artistic argument or\
  \ rankled creative expression. Instead, a committee selected a crowd-sourced, market-tested,\
  \ stock image of the universally palatable. The thing is effectively bespoke rental\
  \ furniture, commissioned only because events such as these have fixings such as\
  \ that. It neither offends nor inspires. \n\nAnd so it goes in Volgograd, where\
  \ I travelled to watch England, braced to witness the source material for the opening\
  \ stanza of \u201CFootball\u2019s Never Coming Home.\u201D\n\nThe event organizers\
  \ have meticulously prepared each element of the matchday experience to ensure unobjectionable\
  \ pleasantry and universal access to the game\u2019s greatest moments. Albeit at\
  \ the grave cost of creating a sterile fabrication of packaged soccer tourism. \n\
  \nPre-match build-up is replete with crowd noise blared through the stadium sound\
  \ system. Lyrics to each nation\u2019s national anthem are displayed on jumbo-screens,\
  \ karaoke sing-along style, gratingly out of sync with the orchestral accompaniment.\
  \ Another round later in the match retains the mistimed promptings for the competing\
  \ teams\u2019 emblematic supporters\u2019 songs. The result is forty thousand people\
  \ mumble-humming.\n\nConcessions outside are the products and sponsored profferings\
  \ of megafirms, hermetically sealed, tightly wrapped, and handed over with the rictus\
  \ of enforced courtesy. Each seating area has the same gleaming red \u201CCoke\u201D\
  \ and \u201CBud\u201D double embankment. The scene could be situated on the banks\
  \ of the Volga, or just as well within the first American settlement on the moon.\
  \ \n\nThe experience devolves into a sad simulacrum of venerated World Cup highlights.\
  \ Each ingredient is present, but in synthetic form. \n\nIn a parallel universe\
  \ I left crestfallen, still in search of the organic experience unique to this Russian\
  \ edition of the World Cup. Thankfully, I had already found it on the way to the\
  \ match.\n\nMy partner and I had departed Moscow the previous morning on the sleeper\
  \ train. Our room was walled on each side with bench seating that folded into two\
  \ sets of rudimentary bunk beds. Sharing the space were assigned roommates Nikita\u2014\
  a Russian fortysomething sporting several chrome serpent rings\u2014and his teenage\
  \ son Anton. Details passed back and forth across the room through finger pointing\
  \ and gross mispronunciations of a Lonely Planet phrasebook. Anton accepted an offered\
  \ biscuit and mumbled back \u201CSyank-yew\u201D along with a volley of crumbs.\
  \ \n\nThe train\u2019s caf\xE9 sold beer en masse to the growing contingent of fans\
  \ pooling around the bar. Uniformed women cooked meals to order. Uniformed fans\
  \ barked requests for another pint. Open cooktop flames coupled with the stifling\
  \ heat of cramped human mass to send forth a frontier of pan-fried, ale air announcing\
  \ the caf\xE9 several carriages away. By mid-evening a red tide of fez-headed, flag-laden\
  \ Tunisians leapt and chanted and sang in frantic unison.\n\nOur route transversed\
  \ the scene of tank battles and air-bases and field hospitals devoid of supplies.\
  \ Of civilian slaughter and propaganda pamphlets fluttering down from a flak-filled\
  \ winter sky. We rolled closer to the epicenter of sniper shots ringing off burnt-out\
  \ rubble, prisoner-of-war camps, and the still-buried remains of frostbitten soldiers,\
  \ some of whom resorted to cannibalism in a final attempt to stave off a fatal hunger.\
  \ \n\nThe train was without internet. Four hundred passengers scrambled in a collective\
  \ nervous tic to tune into the ongoing matches. Some huddled around phones with\
  \ a data-enabled Russian SIM. Others resigned themselves quickly and returned to\
  \ reading or an early bedtime. \n\nMy partner and I found a radio stream and sat\
  \ together in shared silence, facing each other on the top bunk. Our hands and heads\
  \ gesticulated wildly in mute euphoria as Mexico put one past holders Germany. \n\
  \nDuring the periods when poor connection halted the stream we simply smiled and\
  \ looked deeply into one another. It was a profoundly unexpected intimacy in a setting\
  \ I thought would be no more than the means of transit between momentous match-days.\
  \ Instead, it capped the most sublime twenty-four hours of the trip."
