Text: "When I first found out I was accepted as a European Volunteer in Marseille,\
  \ France, I was absolutely thrilled. Although it wasn`t the first time traveling\
  \ to France, I knew nothing about Marseille, except the fact that it was at the\
  \ Mediterranean Sea and that it was about to fulfill my dream of living for long\
  \ term in a city along the marvelous C\xF4te d'azur. \nThe second thing that crossed\
  \ my mind was the fact that I was about to land for the second time in a city of\
  \ Cultures, Marseille being the European Capital of Culture 2013, the year spent\
  \ there. Why the second time in such a city? Because back in 2007, I spent a few\
  \ months, also as a volunteer, in Sibiu, a Romanian city and the European Capital\
  \ of Culture 2007. In conclusion, arts, culture and education were chasing me all\
  \ over the place. \nAnd the third most excited thing was the fact that I was getting\
  \ closer to Saint-Tropez, the small fisherman village, an extremely well-known tourist\
  \ area, famous for its adorable movie series character, Ludovic Cruchot, the sergeant\
  \ of gendarmerie of Saint-Tropez, played by the greatest Louis de Fun\xE8s. It was\
  \ a dream to be able to visit this place, which I finally did.   \nMy passion for\
  \ traveling and having new experiences turned into a dream come true. Before leaving,\
  \ I started to tell everyone about the excitement of discovering this new place.\
  \ Unfortunately, most of the people argued that Marseille isn`t such an excellent\
  \ choice because it was heard to be a controversial city, all because of high migration\
  \ and all sorts of dangers. \nI took into account some of these ideas, but I remained\
  \ open to my habit of not starting a new journey with being judgmental, because\
  \ nothing good will come out of it. So, I leaped into the unknown, putting my curiosity\
  \ to work and discover this amazing city step by step.  \nTurned out that Marseille,\
  \ this magical mysterious woman, as I like to call it, opened like a book before\
  \ my eyes. I had the chance to discover and observe all its treasures: her magnificent\
  \ views mirrored like diamonds in the crystal clear Mediterranean Sea, its welcoming\
  \ diversity with its first question being \u201CWhere do you come from?\u201D, with\
  \ her incredible arts and cultures that harmoniously combine the old and the new,\
  \ with her controversial history reflected in her strongholds, the architecture\
  \ and the long cliff that plays a particular theatre play for the viewer every time\
  \ one takes the courage to walk along it, with her specific light that inspired\
  \ so many artists throughout history, with her openness and hospitable French people\
  \ always ready to offer a helping hand and a chance to an associative life and work.\
  \ I discovered a France with a keen on environmental protection, with a passion\
  \ for active citizenship and an eye turned to things that matter, to people who\
  \ can make a difference and a school of migrants that harmoniously integrate foreigners\
  \ in its culture. \nAn absolute treasure chest I didn`t expect to find, and a familiarity\
  \ I was immediately absorbed by. Having left my country with no French language\
  \ on board (not to mention my initial rejection for studying this language), in\
  \ three months, I became a French language addict and a lover of communication.\
  \ I even gave an interview for the local press, fluently speaking French for an\
  \ hour. \nIt`s true, Marseille has also its own bad parts, but the Capital of Culture\
  \ made it an important and relevant geographical point on the map, helping diminish\
  \ the prejudice that can be a dangerous area. \nI was absolutely fascinated that\
  \ for an entire year, I took the chance to work here and discover the heart of this\
  \ wonderful city. Even today, Marseille remains the most enchanting book I have\
  \ ever read, not only because it was well written in the first place, but because\
  \ I myself helped in writing its chapters through out the work I was engaged in,\
  \ the people I met, the language training I received, the projects I did there.\
  \ And I am most proud of that. Proud to have come back at the end of 2013 and speak\
  \ on a local TV show about this educational and touring experience, not to mention\
  \ campaigning about youth mobility opportunities within the EU."
