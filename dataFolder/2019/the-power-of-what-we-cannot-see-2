Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s done,\u201D she says as I am slurping my dragon fruit smoothie\
  \ by the pool. \u201CNow we wait,\u201D she adds while rubbing sunscreen in her\
  \ arms. I give her a confident look hoping to soothe her nerves. I know that the\
  \ next two weeks will be tense, even if we are waiting in heaven on earth. \n\n\
  We are two girls in their bikinis sunbathing, on vacation. Yes, but our visit is\
  \ also diplomatic, and one of us may have to stay in this location.\n\nWe decide\
  \ to walk it off. Scooters come and go in both directions along the compressed road.\
  \ We line up in the narrow sidewalk, skipping over open sewers and colorful handmade\
  \ blessings. Excited locals try to get our attention, how to resist all the rattan\
  \ goods collection? \u201CCome in! I\u2019ll take care of you!\u201D says a masseuse.\
  \ Ximena stops suddenly and looks back at me. \u201CI\u2019m tired of being defined\
  \ by my passport,\u201D she says with anger.     \n\nTo ease her mind, I suggest\
  \ all the Ubud spiritual staples, while my inner skeptical jeers. I ignore it, wearing\
  \ my best friend hat, holding my confession. \n\nAnd suddenly I have daily mat dates.\
  \ Flowing with the rhythm of my breath. The soothing and elongated voice of Ketut\
  \ guides my following move. \n\nInhale. \n\nMy hands slide, my knees shake as I\
  \ stretch my arms to form a wobbly warrior pose. \n\nExhale. \n\nDrops of water\
  \ run through my face, and one of them gets into my eye. Winking I look up, and\
  \ the sun shines in the clear sky. Now I know what a drop of sweat feels like in\
  \ my sight. I collapse. \n\nKetut smiles saying \u201CAnchor in your breath.\u201D\
  \ I struggle, and I lack poise. I hate to admit that I am starting to enjoy this.\
  \  \n\nEvery day we are more at ease. The clock is ticking. We let it be. It must\
  \ be the place where we hide. Durian tastings, rice field catwalks, swinging out\
  \ our emo talks. \n\nWhat is a luwak? We ask. They don\u2019t answer but make us\
  \ try its discharge in coffee cups. It\u2019s nice! \n\nThere\u2019s a volcano,\
  \ want to hike? There\u2019s no toilet for hours but what a sunrise!\n\nWe visit\
  \ a local home. Bless a house, what a shore! Offerings for the spirits of the earth\
  \ and the sky, the death and the alive. A lot takes to keep up with the cleanse\
  \ of all divine.  \n\nGorgeous temples that excite my eyes. Got your period? You\
  \ can\u2019t say hi. How will they know? I ask. It\u2019s karmic energy. The will\
  \ charge you, the gods up high. In this life or the next, you\u2019ll pay the price.\
  \ Do you believe? She asks me back. I am not sure, but I must comply.    \n\nA man\
  \ named Wayan reads my palm. He guesses all my fears and lacks. Want a boyfriend?\
  \ He is nearby. I want my visa! Xime replies. \n\nBali gave us joy, made our friendship\
  \ deep. Maybe magic dust in all the noodles we devoured? It was something we didn\u2019\
  t foresee. A visit short and sweet. Just like this rhyme. \n\nBut the day that I\
  \ fly back home arrives, and we still have not heard from them. I am hoping that\
  \ an answer would drop in her inbox while I pack my bags. Hopes are in vain. My\
  \ taxi arrives, and her fearful sight catches mine as she approaches to hold me\
  \ tight. I know she resisted the idea to be here alone. But this experience will\
  \ help her grow. \u201CYou will be fine!\u201D I promise excited. \u201CBelieve\
  \ in the power of the mind.\u201D I jump in the car, see her wave away and disappear\
  \ when we turn. \n\nPassport in my pocket, air in my lungs, karmic energies, the\
  \ power of thoughts, love and friendship bonds. The power of the things that we\
  \ cannot see is in the way they hold us back, lift us and shape us without our consent.\
  \ Whether we believe or not. \n\nTwo weeks have passed, and my phone rings. Balinese\
  \ number, I know who calls. I smile to the sky excited to know that she is coming\
  \ home. There was nothing to worry after all."
