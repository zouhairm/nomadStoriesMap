Text: "When first meeting my soon to be wife, I'd heard her stories of the Palio -\
  \ the passionate and crazy bare back horse race in Siena's cramped main square,\
  \ but was totally unaware of the history and passion behind it.  I've since learned\
  \ that the Palio is Siena. And without the Palio, Siena wouldn't be what it is.\n\
  She'd made me watch the VHS tapes her parents sent her while we lived in Germany.\
  \   I'd seen the videos, films, comments on the web about it, but when I actually\
  \ got to experience it first-hand, it was a different story.  She is a member of\
  \ the \"Contrada della Torre\" - one of the 17 different districts which make up\
  \ Siena, each with it's own flag, mascot and history.  They were once factions of\
  \ the military and slowly became social centers and the city would have contests\
  \ between the neighborhoods as both a community builder and a way to reward neighborhoods\
  \ with money (gold).  The contests have varied throughout the centuries but always\
  \ involved a horse, until the the mid 16th century when the Palio as we know it\
  \ today was born.  The members of the contrada are \"born\" into the contrada. \
  \ You cannot simply join; you have to be born there or  have a family member born\
  \ in the neighborhood and you are \"baptized\" into the contrada in a ceremony at\
  \ the contrada's fountain.  You are assigned a scarf at that time which you are\
  \ expected to treat with as much respect as your first born child.   It's even more\
  \ serious than that.\nNot getting into too much detail, at the time, my wife's \"\
  contrada\" hadn't won in more than 35 years (she had never seen them win in her\
  \ lifetime).  The stars that August all aligned -  a good horse, an accomplished\
  \ rider and, well, some money...- and the night before as they ate, drank and sang\
  \ in hope and delusion, I suddenly felt something I'd never felt before -  a connection.\
  \  As we stumbled back at 3AM, it was silence, no talking about tomorrow, let the\
  \ cards fall as they may.  And the next afternoon, as destiny fell right into her\
  \ hands and her Contrada won, I saw a mature, strong woman reduced to tears of an\
  \ infant when they get that gift they've always desired.  As the tourists and others\
  \ in the square congratulated her in her glory, she suddenly stood up and grabbed\
  \ my my hand and started to run through the stands and in little secret passages\
  \ only know to a true Sienese on the way to the Cathedral of Siena.  We arrived\
  \ and got inside with hundreds of others already streaming in front and behind us...waiting\
  \ on the horse and jockey to enter it became an inferno inside with all the people...steaming\
  \ with heat and expectation but no one was complaining.  As the flag bearers and\
  \ drummers began the procession into the cathedral, the anticipation and tension\
  \ grew....suddenly with one loud  explanation of passion, the almost naked jockey\
  \ (his clothing and such had since been torn away as mementos of the win) with the\
  \ the winning horse arrived slowly as he was surrounded by the members of the contrada\
  \ who just wanted to touch the horse or the jockey...he reached the altar and silence\
  \ ensued.  He dismounted, prayed to the maria and then was embraced by the upper\
  \ members of the contrada.  As this happened, the entire cathedral erupted into\
  \ a chant known as \"Te Deum\" (Praise to the Trinity) and afterwards, streamed\
  \ out with flags and chants into the streets of Siena.  \nThe rest of the night\
  \ was a mixture of crying drinking and bell ringing.  As customary, the winning\
  \ neighborhood offers all of Siena wine to celebrate with them the whole night.\
  \  After almost 40 years of not winning, the wine began to flow and the whole city\
  \ of Siena (with the exception of those \"enemy\" neighborhoods - the Onda and Oca\
  \ -  who removed their lights and went into darkmode instantly) partied into the\
  \ wee hours of the morning in the main square and in the neighborhood.  The church\
  \ bells of the winning contrada contantly being rung by anyone who so wished until\
  \ the next Palio began."
