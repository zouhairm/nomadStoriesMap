Text: "65,610 square kilometers is a mite of the land mass of our planet. Yet in this\
  \ tiny country Sri Lanka, the northern province was inaccessible to her own. A block\
  \ of land cut-off from the rest not by walls, fences or wires \u2013 but by landmines.\
  \ With the twist of time, I was travelling to this part of my own country once dreaded,\
  \ not on a sightseeing or a picnic \u2013 but with the bleakest hope to collect\
  \ funds to build a cancer hospital estimated at $5 million from the rupees and cents\
  \ of the poor northerners, who were ravaged by the local civil war. \nThe roads\
  \ that were trampled by the war tankers weighing tons wouldn\u2019t have felt a\
  \ fraction of the weight, though ten of us were in one vehicle. The air that carried\
  \ the painful screams of the dying innocent civilians, the injured soldiers or the\
  \ terrorist for thirty long years \u2013 would have never thought it would ever\
  \ carry the laughter across the land. The soil that was once drenched with blood\
  \ was beginning to taste the showers of mother nature. We traveled close to 390\
  \ kilometers by road, only to walk back the same distance in the days to come \u2013\
  \ all for a worthy cause. \nAfter spending the longest night in anguish in my life;\
  \ I set off to the starting point, the furthest most end of our tiny island Point\
  \ Pedro, to begin the 670 kilometers walk. The hostility that prevailed in Jaffna\
  \ towards the rest of the country was vivid in my mind. The officials flagged off\
  \ our walk and I started off with many others who had but one goal \u2013 build\
  \ unity among the ethnicity in our country! \nThe ruined houses along the roads\
  \ welcomed us, showing the traces of the power of man-made artillery. The burnt\
  \ face of the public library exposed what ignorance could do \u2013 wiping away\
  \ the wealth any country would be proud to treasure. The walls \u2013 which we thought\
  \ were covered with graffiti \u2013 on a closer look displayed the names of those,\
  \ whose helpless bodies were riddled with bullets. The empty till in my hand was\
  \ getting heavier with pain and agony in my heart; each step I walked. Will I ever\
  \ find a smile on this part of the country \u2013 was the million-dollar question.\
  \ \nA kilometer into the walk, I heard the chirpy voices of kids coming towards\
  \ us. My feet were moving faster than my heart. Yes! I was in front of a primary\
  \ school and the teachers were rushing the kids to the road to acknowledge us and\
  \ give us a boost to make it through! They had nothing to put into our tills \u2013\
  \ but their innocent smiles enriched us with energy that no man could sponsor. A\
  \ few more yards along the potholed road, I heard someone calling out. Fear gripped\
  \ my heart yet, I waited behind. A young girl came panting towards me and grabbed\
  \ the only possession I had in my hand \u2013 my empty till. Very carefully she\
  \ unfolded a crushed currency note \u2013 the second largest local tender; a 1,000\
  \ rupee and put it into my till. With tears rolling down she said, \u201Cthe hospital\
  \ you built in the North in 2011 with the money from the South, saved my brother,\
  \ now it\u2019s my turn to show gratitude\u201D. I hugged her forgetting all differences.\n\
  A frail lady stopped me at the bus terminal which was once abandoned and neglected.\
  \ I was shocked with her gesture. As she pulled out her \u2018wallet\u2019 - a torn\
  \ envelop, took all the coins she had & dropped them with love one by one into my\
  \ till. \u201CI am feeble to walk the entire distance with you dear, but I shall\
  \ now walk the distance home and be part of your walk\u201D, she said. \nThe fallen\
  \ trees that reminded me of the civilians with lost limbs and welcomed me the previous\
  \ day, now seemed to wave at me with new hope. The scourging heat wasn\u2019t hurting\
  \ my skin \u2013 as my soul had found something that I didn\u2019t expect to find\u2026\
  . Humanity, warmth and affection \u2013 in a land that knew only war for the past\
  \ thirty years..!"
