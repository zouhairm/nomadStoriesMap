Text: "Hi,This is Anupama, okiee.. so here i start with my introduction.. I'm a south\
  \ indian girl, residing in Bangalore as Software Engineer (9-5 job hahaha.. ). My\
  \ passion for travelling started when I had breakup(haha), and had a regular boring\
  \ routine. This is what made me to start travelling to the places where i always\
  \ wanted to go. I've a friend in [email\_protected]  who is much interested in govt\
  \ jobs,so he travels throughout india to write govt exams in low budget,i was inspired\
  \ by him.so that's how i decided to step out and one day i was in my shoes and a\
  \ bagpack on my back. I Started going to the nearest places as to build confidence\
  \ to be a solo traveller, i travelled in train, buses and stayed at hostels. My\
  \ aim was to be in that place at the right time in right climate, whatever it may\
  \ be sunrise,sunset,rainy,sunny! \"All i wanted to be there, in that moment\". \n\
  A traveller never sleeps until he/she has felt the place through heart\u2764, this\
  \ i have realised while climbing Kumara parvata mountain in karnataka which was\
  \ my first toughest trek!. \nAll i know is Experiences are confined in heart. Words\
  \ are not enough to express. \n\nFrom,\nNatureGirl(insta:Anugalaxy)."
