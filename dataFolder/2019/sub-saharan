Text: "Sand is the science of life with a path the endless length of our earth follows\
  \ with suspense and desire or the unknown route ahead. Books may give you an idea\
  \ for you to create a picture but the feel of another soil is soothing like a prize\
  \ well deserved, a trip to Kumasi.\n\nA commercial city on the southern region of\
  \ Ghana blessed by natural resources of immense wealth in human and mineral, I resonate\
  \ the structure of wise decisions of past generations in buildings, commercial activities,\
  \ road network, culture and government. A monarchy well respected in it's royalty\
  \ brings to a hierarchy of well organized traditions governed by sustainable laws.\n\
  \nNotable names have emerged from this region like Mohammed ben Abdallah a Ghanaian\
  \ playwright who wrote the book 'The Slaves' was born in the 1940's. His book though\
  \ the first written in 1972 is description of life in the pre-colonial era. He later\
  \ became the foremost non-American dramatic play to win the Randolph Edmund's Award\
  \ of the National Association for Speech and Dramatic Arts in 2003.\n\nA reputable\
  \ institute of academic excellence is also situated in Kumasi. Kwameh Nkrumah University\
  \ of Science and Technology ushers into the labour market, young men and women alike\
  \ with a knack for progressive and defined structures. \n\nThe delicacies here are\
  \ not to be overlooked, Banku which is a baked cornmeal is taking with a peppered\
  \ sauce and tilapia which is one of so many fishes found in the clear rivers of\
  \ the Ashanti region. The Ashanti religion is a mixture of spiritual and supernatural\
  \ powers. They believe that plants, animals, and trees have souls. They also believe\
  \ in fairies, witches, and forest monsters. There are a variety of religious beliefs\
  \ involving ancestors, higher gods, or abosom, and 'Nyame', the Supreme Being of\
  \ Ashanti. The Ashanti are the largest tribe in Ghana and one of the few matrilineal\
  \ societies in West Africa. The Asante kingdom was founded by the great King Osei\
  \ Tutu in the eighteenth century. His fetish priest was Okomfo Anokye, who unified\
  \ the Asante states through allegiance to the Golden Stool, which miraculously descended\
  \ from heaven.\n\nKumasi is near Lake Bosomtwe, in a rain forest region, and is\
  \ the commercial, industrial and cultural capital of Asanteman.\n\nI believe to\
  \ have seen much but irrespective of the hospitality I will like to experience life\
  \ in the northern region of Ghana. Cities like Tamale, Takoradi also known as the\
  \ oil city, Accra, Volta regions are all unique in their features."
