Text: "\"The women in Poland are the most beautiful in the world.\" Wojtek, our driver\
  \ tells us. I don't disagree. His daughter, Zosia, is sitting next to me, big blue\
  \ eyes, Ariel red hair, and a wide toothy grin. \"Zosia, powiedz co\u015B po angielsku\"\
  . She shies away and giggles. I smile back. \n\nWe are driving through the Olsztyn\
  \ countryside after a day of walking through town and a heavy meal at a local 'bar\
  \ mleczny' (milk bar) - a worker's canteen serving hearty polish food. Filled up\
  \ with pierogies and og\xF3rkowa (cucumber soup), the calming scent of summer wafts\
  \ in through the window. \n\n\"She has something for the match today\" Wojtek looks\
  \ at us through the rear-view mirror.  \n\nZosia dives into her child sized backpack\
  \ and yanks out two crayons glued together. Red and white, polish national colours.\
  \ She already has the flag on her face and proceeds to start painting on mine. I\
  \ wish it was this easy to paint my countries onto my face, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.\
  \ I remember spending ages drawing my flag on International day in kindergarten\
  \ while my Japanese friend coloured in one red dot in the center of her paper and\
  \ promptly ran off to play hide and seek. I ended up being the very last person\
  \ to finish drawing my country's flag- even the Albanian kid, because I was meticulously\
  \ etching each Kazakh pattern. I never felt very attached to my countries growing\
  \ up, so it was touching to see Zosia so passionate about a football match. Her\
  \ roots seemed so solid, untouchable. She turned armed with her crayons and started\
  \ painting on my friend Sophie's face, who also grew up in between two countries\
  \ and suffered the international school life with me. We share a knowing glance,\
  \ I give Zosia a little hug.  \n\nPatriot was a dirty word for me growing up. As\
  \ an immigrant in the Czech Republic, I saw the two faces of patriotism. Firstly,\
  \ as a form of rejection; \"You don't belong here\" the Czech kids used to sneer\
  \ at me, and the second as a form of being trapped \"you only belong here\" my parents\
  \ whispered into my ear whenever we visited Kazakhstan, my country in which I felt\
  \ like even more of an immigrant. That is the curse of an immigrant, you belong,\
  \ and you don't, a living contradiction. You live your life feeling like an outsider,\
  \ and maybe that is why you yearn to travel so much- it recreates a special sense\
  \ of belonging and attachment to a land. That is why I was excited when my friend\
  \ Ma\u0142gorzata invited us to Poland. I was eager, but I certainly didn't expect\
  \ to be a patriot in Poland.  \n\nWe finally arrive at Ma\u0142gorzata's family\
  \ hotel to watch 'the game'. In the bar, we huddle up into our own corner, Zosia\
  \ is already starting to charge 5 z\u0142otys per face paint. I change into a red\
  \ and white t-shirt and a Polska scarf I found in Ma\u0142gorzata's house and order\
  \ a pint of Tyskie. Everyone is eager for the game, and slowly the bar fills up\
  \ with youngsters and old men ready to watch the game. The group in front of us\
  \ order several plates of pickles, sausage, and cheese, and of course a bottle of\
  \ fine 'Polska wodka' resting in a bed of ice. The TV is turned on, the beers are\
  \ poured, and the shot glasses are ready- the match begins.  \n\n45 minutes, cigarette\
  \ breaks, and a lot of 'POLSKA!' cheering later, our team lost. Zosia walks out\
  \ of the bar with big tears rolling down her huffy red cheeks, she is devastated.\
  \ Despite the loss, a sense of togetherness lingers as people stand around outside\
  \ discussing the injustices of the game. One of the youngsters with now smudged\
  \ polish flags on his cheeks crouches down and comforts little Zosia.  \n\n\u201C\
  We will win next time\u201D, he smiles at her. She looks up at him and wipes her\
  \ tears, slowly a smile emerges. Right then I became the least likely polish patriot."
