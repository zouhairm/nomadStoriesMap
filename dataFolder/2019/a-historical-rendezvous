Text: "Bucket List (Noun): A number of experience or achievements that a person hopes\
  \ to have or accomplish during their lifetime.\n\nEvery person holds a travel list\
  \ close to their heart. While some could tick off all, some others don\u2019t manage\
  \ to tick off any. After Sandakphu, I turned to conquering another magnificent one\
  \ \u2013 the Angkor Wat!\n\nAfter a month-long planning, speculations and research,\
  \ I boarded the flight from Kolkata to Bangkok. After a few hours wait at the airport,\
  \ we boarded our Air Asia flight at 7:10 AM which landed at Phnom Penh International\
  \ Airport at 8:25 AM. \n\nWhile the flight was about to land, we noticed the plush\
  \ landscapes around us. It was secluded from the skyscrapers and the humdrums of\
  \ Bangkok. Getting off the flight, we headed straight for the Visa on Arrival section.\
  \ Cambodia visa fee is $30 and is completely hassle-free. After obtaining the visa,\
  \ we took a tuktuk and headed straight to our \u201COne Up Hotel\u201D near the\
  \ BKK area.\n\nAfter lunch, we went to see the Independence Monument which was only\
  \ a few blocks away from the restaurant. It is a splendid structure constructed\
  \ in 1958 to commemorate the victory of Cambodia over France in the same year. It\
  \ stands in the centre of the city at the intersection of the 2 most important boulevards\
  \ \u2013 Norodom and Sihanouk. From here, we hired a tuktuk to the famous Riverside\
  \ (Sisowath Quay). We stopped at one of the Buddhist temples, Wat Ounalom. It is\
  \ considered to be the most important wat of Phnom Penh and the center of Cambodian\
  \ Buddhism. Wat Ounalom was established in 1443 and is said to be preserving an\
  \ eyebrow hair of Buddha in one of the stupas located there.\nStrolling along the\
  \ Riverside, we headed towards the Foreign Correspondents Club (FCC) for a drink.\
  \ FCC offers a great view of the Riverside while serving drinks at cheap prices.\
  \ \n\nNext day started at 7:00 AM as we prepared for a day-long visit to the Killing\
  \ Fields and the S-21 museum. It was a 30 minutes tuktuk ride to the outskirts of\
  \ Phnom Penh to reach the Choeung Ek \u2013 one of the Killing Fields during the\
  \ Khmer Rouge.\n\nChoeung Ek is only one and the most important of the 300 Killing\
  \ Fields in Cambodia, where several political prisoners from the S-21 prison were\
  \ killed and buried during the Khmer Rouge between 1975-1979. It is located about\
  \ 15 kms from Phnom Penh. Mass graves of 8985 bodies (men, women and children) were\
  \ discovered at Choung Ek after the fall of the Khmer Rouge. Fragments of human\
  \ bones and clothes are still scattered around the pits. Today, there stands a memorial\
  \ stupa at Choung Ek, where more than 5000 human skulls, arranged by sex and age\
  \ and human bones are preserved in 13 levels. The audio tour includes how the prisoners\
  \ were transferred from the S-21 detention centre in the middle of the night, how\
  \ they were executed and also chilling accounts of Him Huy, a Choeung Ek guard and\
  \ executioner, Former Prison Director Duch and a few heart-wrenching stories of\
  \ the survivors. There is also a museum that chronicles the brutalities that were\
  \ carried out at the Killing Fields.\n\nAfter reliving the horror of the Khmer Rouge,\
  \ we visited the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. The museum was formerly a high school,\
  \ which was converted into the notorious Security Prison 21 (S-21) during the Khmer\
  \ Rouge between 1975-1979. The buildings were enclosed in barbed wire and the classrooms\
  \ were converted into tiny prison cells and torture chambers. Out of an estimated\
  \ 20,000 prisoners at Tuol Sleng, only 7 survivors are known today.\n\nWe headed\
  \ for the National Museum thereafter where we cruised through Cambodian history.\
  \ The museum has a vast collection of Khmer art and sculpture in stone, bronze and\
  \ ceramics. Many sculptures of Hindu gods and goddesses are also preserved here,\
  \ like Ganesha, Vishnu, Lakshmi, etc.\n\nTo end our last day at Phnom Penh, we went\
  \ to the much acclaimed Eclipse Sky Bar, located at the 23rd floor of the Phnom\
  \ Penh Tower. This is an ideal place to catch a glimpse of the setting sun along\
  \ the busy Phnom Penh skyline."
