Text: "I was taught to live and learn freely. By doing that, you have to go see the\
  \ rest of the world. I have refused to live inside a box, where a like button is\
  \ more important than an experience. Having the opportunity to live, and be healthy,\
  \ and see what the world and it\u2019s beauty has in store for me is a blessing\
  \ to have. I hope many others can take the time and invest in themselves to see\
  \ that there\u2019s more than just the road you live on, or the gym you attend,\
  \ and what bills that need to get paid. There\u2019s more than the typical 9-5 job,\
  \ and the key to find out where the rest lies, is for you to go and LIVE. Traveling\
  \ has brought so much lessons in my personal life and my professional life. I met\
  \ people who had stories and hardships that made me grateful for my own life and\
  \ experiences. I have traveled mostly across the United States, but I am looking\
  \ for the rest of the world; I will leave my country to go seek more adventure.\
  \ I have family from Europe, they are explorers and professional enthusiasts of\
  \ culture seeking. This is how I will live, enthusiastic for the love, the culture\
  \ the other parts of the world offer."
