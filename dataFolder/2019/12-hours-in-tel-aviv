Text: "9:00 A.M.\n\nCracking open a bleary, sleep-clouded eye, I wake with a start\
  \ to the music of Israel. \n\nVendors shout earnestly, proclaiming the quality of\
  \ their goods for all the heavens to hear. A child laughs, and bites into a doughy\
  \ laffa flatbread. From somewhere unseen drifts a tinkling bell melody, but try\
  \ as I might to pinpoint its source, I spy only a stern-browed grandmother frying\
  \ fresh latkes. \n\n9:00 A.M. isn\u2019t that late of a wakeup by American standards,\
  \ but here in Tel Aviv, the city blossoms to life with each passing dawn. I change\
  \ hastily into my street clothes - my first stop is the Jaffa shuk market, and I\
  \ don\u2019t want to miss a thing.\n\n12:00 P.M.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to feel a sense\
  \ of magic pushing through Jaffa\u2019s narrow, cobblestoned aisles. This market,\
  \ known locally as the Shuk Hapishpeshim, is a dizzying wonderland of fabric and\
  \ spice. Bowls of rouge-toned powder line each stall like offerings, and merchants\
  \ sidle up to each passing guest, beckoning to their wants with unspeakably coy\
  \ smiles.\n\nI stop for lunch in one of the more secluded corners of the shuk. Like\
  \ everyone here, Chef Har-el Zakaim has a story. Legend has it he spent years in\
  \ prison for aiding an armed rebellion and only recently escaped to freedom in Tel\
  \ Aviv. Disregarding his rather interesting background, Zakaim was an exceptional\
  \ chef. While he had mastered the staples of Middle Eastern cooking Westerners are\
  \ familiar with, like falafel, pita, and hummus, he chose to introduce me to several\
  \ lesser-known gems of Israeli cooking. I particularly savored his grilled purple\
  \ calamari paired with labneh yogourt, and I highly recommend trying his shikshukit:\
  \ a spiced ground lamb dish embellished by tahini and lemon. \n\n3:00 P.M.\n\nI\
  \ soon left Jaffa to meet my old friend Tamir. As I explored Neve Tzedek, the trendiest\
  \ of neighborhoods, I found myself marveling at its delicate balancing act between\
  \ tradition and modernity. Here, the streets overflow with startups, dazzling mural\
  \ art, and casual cosmopolitanism.  \n\nWhile we caught up with each others\u2019\
  \ lives, we stopped to try this \u201Cchaser\u201D Tamir recommended me. As it turns\
  \ out, this was in fact a shot of arac, a not-so-delicious Turkish licorice liqueur\
  \ that burns as it goes down. I sputtered and gasped for a solid two minutes before\
  \ shooting Tamir the angriest glare I could muster up.\n\n6:00 P.M.\n\nWe hurried\
  \ back to the ancient quarter, where we were expected at a traditional Shabbat dinner\
  \ with a local family. Mr. Tsur Antony Levy was graciously hosting Tamir and I,\
  \ as well as several other guests, to share his Jewish heritage with us.\n\nTsur\u2019\
  s family may have prepared the tastiest vegan meal I\u2019ve ever had, with bright\
  \ legumes, spiced baba ghanoush, and braided challah bread adorning the table. The\
  \ flavors from the food already had us bursting with energy, but Tsur also made\
  \ sure we had entertainment for the night. For each person he ladled a cashew-cream\
  \ sauce onto a baked potato, which was placed between two sheets of parchment paper.\
  \ We were then asked to stamp it into a mash - while standing on top of the table!\
  \ \n\nWestern formalities flew out the window as I kicked off my shoes and crushed\
  \ the potatoes with my bare feet.\n\n\n9:00 P.M.\n\nAs the dinner drew to a close,\
  \ Tsur rose from his seat. He thanked us all for the night, spoke of the complexities\
  \ of Israel\u2019s political situation, and took a moment to remember all the lives\
  \ claimed by conflict.\n\nAt first, I wasn\u2019t sure where I - a half Peruvian,\
  \ half Chinese girl born in Belgium but living in Canada - fit into all of this.\
  \ But as I walked to the bus station, stars hanging overhead, everything became\
  \ clear. Tonight, we broke bread with people from all walks of life, showing our\
  \ hearts to one another without fear or hate. By seeing more of the world, we open\
  \ our eyes to the oft-forgotten bonds tying us together. \n\nI didn't think I would,\
  \ but here I found a sense of belonging. Stumbling tiredly on a bump in the sidewalk,\
  \ I smiled, and thought to myself how much I\u2019d like to try that lamb dish again\
  \ one day."
