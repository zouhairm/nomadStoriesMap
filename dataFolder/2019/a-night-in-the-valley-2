Text: "Easing my way slowly down into the fog of the valley below, I carefully placed\
  \ my footing on the dew covered steel steps that were bolted into the side of Sportsmans\
  \ landing. Summer solstice had just passed, and the Russian River was now open for\
  \ the harvest of Red Salmon. Upon reaching the water, the sight of Seagulls by the\
  \ thousands scratching and pecking for any substance they could find on the hundreds\
  \ of Salmon carcauses lining the rocky river bank left me in awe. With no experience\
  \ of using a fly-fishing rod, and the overwhelming anxiety to succeed, this hike\
  \ in revealed a living, flowing, lifeblood for this Valley.\n\n Appearing through\
  \ the clouds seemed to me like a scene out of my favorite childhood movie, \"Jurassic\
  \ Park\". Alaska's vast, yet seemingly lush landscape struck me with the sense grandeur\
  \ while making the drive down Seward Highway from Anchorage to Cooper Landing. Clouds\
  \ met the snow covered peaks which apperared to be jutting from the earth supplying\
  \ water to the valley below. Through a mutual friend, I became lucky enough to witness\
  \ the magic of this place first hand and get to know just how important that ice\
  \ in the sky really is.\n\nThe humbling view of such powerful, raging water meandering\
  \ North towards the Kenai River pointed us to our fishing destination. While I assumed\
  \ fishing in Alaska would be simple, I should've known better. Along the river runs\
  \ a elevated steal walkway that seemed to never end. After about one and a half\
  \ miles of seeing no body the river becomes shallow and we're able to cross. The\
  \ next bend is what left me speechless.\n\nEven with the dandelion covered meadows\
  \ along the steep shore bank, and the short, maze like placement of the pine trees,\
  \ the most crisp fresh air awakening my senses and the noise of running water and\
  \ Seaguls; the sight to see was the hundreds of fisherman or women lining each side\
  \ of the river banks. Continuing in the same direction were able to see the shear\
  \ volume of people this mystic place the locals call Chunuk'tnu was benefitting.\
  \ \n\nEntering the water and taking my first cast I realize this is going to be\
  \ challenging. The water pressure against my body was enough to make me worry about\
  \ falling over and learning that red salmon dont bite the hook seemed impossible.\
  \ With determination and the rythimic casts of the fly rod, I was able to limit\
  \ out and learn exactly what it is all the people are benefiting from. That ever\
  \ so distant Mountain runoff is essential for everthing in the grand scheme of things.\
  \ The freshwater and food for all land animals, the safe haven for the fish populations,\
  \ and most importantly those who live here and are able to call this beautiful place\
  \ there home. I was the outsider here but I never felt that way, this place gives\
  \ you the sense of excitment and security. Nature is an incredible thing and I've\
  \ never seen something bring so many different people together in one place, for\
  \ the same shared passion."
