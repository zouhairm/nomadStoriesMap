Text: "Sunlight fills the dirt roads, reflecting on piles of garbage nearby. The odor\
  \ is masked by dusty air, mixed with chai and spices from cooking pots outside.\
  \ Temporary buildings are always at risk of being torn down by the government, and\
  \ pigs roam the area scouring for bits of food. This forgotten community is my favorite\
  \ part of Delhi: the slums.\n\tTwo twelve-year-old girls hold my hands as they chatter\
  \ on about their hobbies, asking if I like to dance (and if not, they will teach\
  \ me). One girl in a bright pink jacket tells me her dream of becoming an actress,\
  \ lowering her voice when we pass a shop, as if she\u2019s afraid to be overheard.\
  \ Her best friend argues that being a dancer is better, with a voice loud and unashamed\
  \ at her dream of leaving the domestic circle society put them in.\n\tLaundry hangs\
  \ on strings between houses, and a woman fans a fire in the cooking area outside\
  \ of her home. She pauses to smile and wave as I pass her. I walk towards the building\
  \ tucked away near the outskirts of the slums. It\u2019s one-roomed with three and\
  \ a half bright blue walls and a large hole that overlooks the neighborhood, known\
  \ to everyone as the local schoolhouse. Created by a woman who convinces parents\
  \ to send their children to school instead of the streets to work, the school tries\
  \ to help pull them from where they\u2019re trapped: dangerously below poverty lines.\n\
  \tI had seen as many as sixty students fill the tiny space. Today, dozens of shoes,\
  \ small and worn-down but neatly lined into rows, wait outside the school door.\
  \ The girls immediately take off their sneakers and jump into the building, announcing\
  \ my arrival.\n\t\u201CNAMASTE, MA\u2019AM!\u201D the roar of students fills my\
  \ ears as I take off my sandals.\n\tA crowd of bright, smiling faces waits impatiently\
  \ for me to come inside. I make sure to greet each student with a handshake. The\
  \ younger students, barely kindergarten-aged, smile shyly, while the older students,\
  \ reaching all the way into their teens, excitedly tell me what they did in the\
  \ 24 hours since I had seen them, from cooking at home for their younger siblings\
  \ to playing cricket with sticks and a plastic bottle in the fields.\n\tThe students\
  \ begin to assemble cross-legged on the cement floor, and I sit next to the blackboard\
  \ propped up on a stool.\n\tOn any other day, we would start lessons. I would review\
  \ English grammar and vocabulary or read them a story. Sometimes, I would talk about\
  \ my hometown, the US, or my current home in South Korea, or even one of the many\
  \ countries I have visited, answering their endless stream of questions about other\
  \ cultures, countries, scenery, and people, only increasing their longing to see\
  \ the world outside of this neighborhood.\n\tBut today is different. It\u2019s the\
  \ end of my volunteering term, and my last day in this classroom. Instead of a teacher,\
  \ I am now the guest at a special performance. The girls dance and sing modern songs\
  \ and reenact famous scenes from classical Indian movies. Many of them have borrowed\
  \ scarves from their aunts or mothers to use as props, and they handle each with\
  \ care. I cannot understand the words, but I feel the joy and bittersweet tone.\
  \ The boys show off their traditional dances, with red ribbons tied to their wrists\
  \ for added flair, and the younger kids draw pictures on scraps of paper for me.\n\
  \t We dance and play together, and as we gather for one more picture, I earnestly\
  \ pray it isn\u2019t the last time we meet. I wave good-bye and put on my shoes.\
  \ Maybe next time I can find them working in the city or studying at a university.\
  \ I can watch a Bollywood movie starring the girl who vows to become a star and\
  \ attend a dance class taught by the girl who always danced around the classroom.\
  \ Or maybe they\u2019ll still be here, helping more children stay in school and\
  \ out of the street. Until then, their smiles and laughter stay with me like warm\
  \ rays of sun radiating from deep in the slums."
