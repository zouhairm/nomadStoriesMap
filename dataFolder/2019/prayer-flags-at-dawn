Text: "Dawn broke around us cold and clear. Jagged shadows of mountains took form\
  \ as we climbed higher. Above us, fellow trekkers \u2013 together yet separate,\
  \ fought the terrain: placing one foot agonizingly in front of the other, as if\
  \ learning to walk again. At 6,000 metres above sea level, each breath is a battle\
  \ against altitude, the cold and one\u2019s mind. I found a slow, steady rhythm\
  \ for my breathing and synchronized it with my footsteps \u2013 slowly, slowly up\
  \ the rock face. Boulders the size of tanks scattered the landscape while below,\
  \ valleys of scree fell away down the ravine. Every aspect of the high pass was\
  \ desperately vivid and elemental \u2013 its primary version of itself. Unpolluted\
  \ cocaine snow, the blue of the sky endless against the mountains and brown \u2013\
  \ no longer filler but the colour of life at its barren source. Animistic and Buddhist\
  \ beliefs of unity with the elements make complete sense in such a drastic world.\
  \ Prayer flags lined each day we spent in the mountains.\n \nNo one finds themselves\
  \ climbing the Thorong La in the Nepalese Himalayas with no reason for being there.\
  \ Whether it\u2019s to challenge or change oneself or to find clarity away from\
  \ the endless distractions of modern life, every trekker has their motive and carries\
  \ it with them on their journey. For me, I had been born with mountains in my mind\
  \ and for as long as I could remember had wanted to experience the Himalayas for\
  \ myself. I was also hoping that the process of trekking, of walking, would focus\
  \ my mind. With each step I\u2019d tried to articulate myself in response to my\
  \ surroundings. As someone who had wandered for most of his adult life, I hoped\
  \ that walking with a goal and just observing would crystallize ideas for my future.\
  \ For my friend and trekking companion, Ofir, it was a different process. He was\
  \ heavily disturbed by having to do compulsory service in the Israeli army, so his\
  \ motive was, like mine, a way of clearing the mind but also an act of catharsis.\
  \ He was traumatized by having to hold a gun, let alone use one. The Thorang La\
  \ pass is the highest in the world and the focal point of the Annapurna circuit.\
  \ Though we took the trek slowly (why rush?), the high pass was always there in\
  \ the back of our minds. Each day we trekked further into the mountains \u2013 travelling\
  \ further past the point of no return. Now, 6,000 metres high, we were making the\
  \ final ascent from base camp to the pass. Two weeks of walking had led to this\
  \ point, though it felt like longer \u2013 almost a lifetime.\n \nThe path takes\
  \ you up the rock face and then onto a plateau of ravines and small valleys. Each\
  \ high point could be the pass but every ascent leads to disappointment: the suspense\
  \ increases. A waterfall, frozen in the freezing morning, an abandoned Sherpa\u2019\
  s hut with a toilet giving new meaning to the word primitive, all add to the tension.\
  \ I was struggling to breathe and could only go a few steps at a time. I was where\
  \ humans didn\u2019t belong, out of place in a lunar landscape, but wasn\u2019t\
  \ this why I was there \u2013 to experience nature and life in its purist form?\n\
  \ \nSuddenly a sonic boom sounded from the peaks above, quickly followed by two\
  \ others. Untapped terror took over me but I managed to stay calm and searched the\
  \ terrain for a place to take cover. I was certain it was an avalanche but the mountains\
  \ remained still. After a few more booms like artillery fire, it became clear I\
  \ was in no immediate danger. Unsettled but safe, I continued up to the pass, where\
  \ the source of the carnage quickly became apparent. Men in military uniforms doing\
  \ training exercises, holding bazookas and  AK47s, swarmed the mountainside below\
  \ the summit\u2019s stupa.\n \u2018Nepalese mountain division, doing training routines!\u2019\
  \nA young American trekker gave me the details. He then turned, reached into his\
  \ bag and pulled out the Stars and Stripes. Carefully and ceremoniously, he held\
  \ the flag aloft and I watched it rippling in the wind, at one with the prayer flags\
  \ around it."
