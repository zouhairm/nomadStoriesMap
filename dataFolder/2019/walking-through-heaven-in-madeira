Text: "As a family, the four of us travelled together frequently, up until I was 18\
  \ and my parents all of a sudden got a bit more smitten with one another and the\
  \ concept of friend\u2019s trips (which my mom always organised). Seven years ago\
  \ was the last time we four set off as the \u2018rents did lots of anniversary trips,\
  \ mom\u2019s girls' trips and my parents and friends couples trips. A few years\
  \ later, I started travelling and this was the start of the end of my house deposit!\
  \ After mom died last spring, we knew that we would still go on holiday for Christmas.\
  \ We three ventured off into a green land of faith-filled symbols all over the country\
  \ which could be seen in roundabouts and the alcohol sections of souvenir shops.\
  \ It was refreshing to see a country so overtly Christian and kind while being independent\
  \ of Portugal. Madeira was our peace like the star of Jesus\u2019 birth at Christmas,\
  \ it was the cool breeze in our hectic year of grief and for a moment, it felt like\
  \ heaven was on Earth.\nWe expect heaven to be somewhere between Earth and space,\
  \ clear, bright and filled with the good people that we knew on Earth. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to feel like I was up there while down here. Madeira put dreams of the\
  \ future and where our loved ones could be into perspective for me, even when talking\
  \ with German guests about our trip here there was a soft touch in our conversations\
  \ that wasn\u2019t rushed or of forced sympathy. People there just got that we had\
  \ a bad year and this place was a healing ground emotionally.\nMadeira is lush!\
  \ Madre m\xEDa, it is violently green, well moisturised like a model\u2019s dewy\
  \ front cover face. Flowers and cacti flowers were growing everywhere nicely. I\
  \ was not sure how I would manage 7 days with my brother and dad but there were\
  \ plenty of choices to drop them off if needed and I almost did the day before heaven.\n\
  They say firsts after everything is hard, this first Christmas without mom was hard.\
  \ We were told to completely rely on God as our first, second and third option.\
  \ A Christmas first in such a green place without the woman who loved green more\
  \ than the grass itself felt very empty. Every other hour whether asking the baker\
  \ about Madeiran bread, walking through trees to fountains or at hotel meal times,\
  \ I could find something to tell my mom but could not tell her. She was not there\
  \ in the physical but very present in the nature we walked through, in the curve\
  \ of the sun as it set and in the flavour of the new foods we tried.\nI call our\
  \ last group tour \u2018heaven\u2019 because as we ascended in that 18-seater bus,\
  \ over 1800 metres above sea level it was foggy. Thick yet dense fog that could\
  \ still be driven through, the slight chill that made you pull your jacket in a\
  \ little because the sun is covered and the sincere silence as every other tourist\
  \ is trusting Luigi on these roads with no safety railings. It lightened near the\
  \ end and you could feel the light where we explored for 30 minutes at this restaurant\
  \ stop off near a hiking trail and military satellite. It felt like I was at plane\
  \ level and could touch the clouds, which we all want to do on a plane on our 6th\
  \ trip for the year. I walked up with my dad and stood at the tip of the trail and\
  \ could see clouds above the little hills, they did not seem far, in my childlike\
  \ Caribbean mind I thought it could be possible to get through 5 miles of Pico Ruivo\
  \ in about a 10-minute light run. It felt safe, peaceful and not like Christmas\
  \ usually is.\nI laugh now, looking at the pictures. I could sit in a caf\xE9 and\
  \ clouds were next to me, without the cloud being next to me as it\u2019s not possible!\
  \ That day I smiled, I really smiled because mom was there and the peace we expect\
  \ in heaven was finally here."
