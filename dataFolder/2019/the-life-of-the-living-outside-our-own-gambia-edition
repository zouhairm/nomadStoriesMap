Text: "My expirence of Gambia was like no other. I\u2019m a 19 year old Irish boy\
  \ that would call myself well traveled and well cultured but my time in Gambia changed\
  \ my whole experience of what travelling really is, and how different my life, your\
  \ life or anyone\u2019s life can be for that matter. I went to Gambia with my secondary\
  \ school or High school. We went there for 10 days but before we could do all that\
  \ we spend 5 months raising as much money as possible for the country and the education\
  \ system. I myself raised over 1,500\u20AC for Gambia. This money we raised went\
  \ directly to an office in Gambia which we then passed over to the 5 Schools that\
  \ our school has started from scratch. Two of which now sport our county colours\
  \ of gold and purple. I felt unsure of what my expectations for Gambia should be\
  \ so I left myself open and was met with a thirty six degree temperature at nine\
  \ thirty at night. That shocked me, and what shocked me more was how normal and\
  \ natural that was for the locals infact many had jumpers on, while I began to slowly\
  \ strip of my sweat drenched clothes. The bus we took to our hostel was packed with\
  \ us all. 20 of us in what looked like a 12 person van. And I\u2019m not counting\
  \ the men on the roof who held our bags from falling off along with our three tour\
  \ guides and the bus driver. Our hostel felt like a luxury in comparison to what\
  \ we saw as we drove there. My body was filled with guilt as I thought about all\
  \ the things I have and they aren\u2019t even aware of. Suddenly all my problems\
  \ became nothing compared to there\u2019s and I felt as if I\u2019ve done zero work\
  \ and that 1,500\u20AC I raised was nothing sort of well nothing. I spent my night\
  \ worrying more about how disappointing it will be that I didn\u2019t sleep the\
  \ whole night. The next day we attended mass in the local church. It was uplifting\
  \ and incredible. They all sang as if they had lessons for years and out shune us\
  \ all in seconds. We of course attempted to join in and we were greeted with a crowd\
  \ full of smiles. Afterwards we join the children outside and the rest of the church\
  \ goers for photos and chats. I was taken aback when I realised that something as\
  \ simple as a pair of glasses was unknown to them. They loved them. They took endless\
  \ photos with my camera with them on and continued to outshine me once again. When\
  \ we left I parted with my glasses because I knew they would receive much more enjoyment\
  \ out of them than I would. We then traveled down the back rods of Gambia nd visit\
  \ the one and only organ player of the town who saved up for years to purchase is\
  \ own portable piano which I could remember having as a child and thinking nothing\
  \ of it. He played beautifully as he did that morning in the church. He told us\
  \ that it was a family talent they all could play and did play and they played better\
  \ than most of friends who all had lessons for years on years. We related him with\
  \ a classical Irish song and as a group sang away. Some of us in the group including\
  \ myself had musical background so I would go as far as saying we didn\u2019t do\
  \ half bad. Our group leader and guide was called Pedro. He spoke over 8 languages\
  \ five of which are Gambia\u2019s local languages. He also spoke Spanish,English\
  \ and french A\u2019s was currently teaching himself German and Chinese. The man\
  \ had me dumbfounded as I spoke English, Irish , poorly I may say, and German. He\
  \ also worked in the office which received the money planned out while trip and\
  \ organised the money split between schools while having two daughters and a wife.\
  \ He is what I would call a real world super hero and he definitely never disappointed.\
  \ That was only day one. We had ten more to go."
