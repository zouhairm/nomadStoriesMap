Text: "NAVIGATING WITH WARRIORS\n\nStanding on the ship deck, I realised I was the\
  \ centre of the universe! Well, what else can you be when a 360 degree horizon stretches\
  \ around without an object or elevation obstructing your view of water and sky clinging\
  \ in perfect harmony of blues? Later in the evocative darkness of the Indian Ocean,\
  \ I comprehended the loneliness of the \u201CAncient Mariner\u201D as even alongside\
  \ 400 Indian naval soldiers on a war ship, I felt \u201Calone on a wide, wide sea\u201D\
  . \n\nTo remain undetected combat ships travel in \u201Cblackout\u201D. So while\
  \ I groped hopelessly, sailors moved around with a surefootedness that would do\
  \ ballet dancers proud especially as the ship swayed like a cradle and an officer\
  \ informed \u201Cthe sea is much worse in monsoon months when ships swing up to\
  \ 45 degrees from port to starboard.\u201D I had expected the combat ship to be\
  \ a vast, comfortable abode but found it was a bare boned structure of pipes and\
  \ tubes supplying electricity, water, air, fuel and fire fighting gases as well\
  \ as sophisticated computer and satellite signals that are vital for human survival.\
  \ For those who complain of a stiff back after an air travel or a night\u2019s train\
  \ journey, it would be worth remembering that naval soldiers spend nearly 280 days\
  \ in such cramped spaces devoid of all amenities and comforts! \n\nOur conversation\
  \ was broken by an announcement on speakers: \u201CAction Stations\u201D; a call\
  \ for all to take posts for imminent action at sea. Intelligence agencies had informed\
  \ of a vessel carrying contraband goods and weapons in the vicinity and though woken\
  \ up at midnight, everyone took their respective positions with clockwork precision\
  \ in less than five minutes from the time of receipt of information. In a commendable\
  \ exhibition of their skilled preparedness, a commando unit stood ready for any\
  \ search and surveillance mission that might be needed while helicopters took off\
  \ into the moonless sky to locate the miscreant ship. Scouting vital information\
  \ from their aerial positions, much ahead of the mother ship, pilots are \"hawk\
  \ eyes\" that help naval commanders devise better strategies of combat and interception.\n\
  \nIt was not war time yet it was palpably clear to me that each moment of the naval\
  \ men\u2019s lives was fraught with danger. And though most citizens are aware of\
  \ Indian army\u2019s brave patrolling of the freezing Himalayan borders, the immense\
  \ and valiant contribution of Indian naval warriors in guarding the 7,500 kilometer\
  \ long water borders is rarely acknowledged by anyone in the public arena. But even\
  \ in that heightened tension, I was astounded to find several warrior friends sharing\
  \ jokes and their bonhomie that was a touching reminder of India's unity in diversity!\
  \ \n\nSeconds after a pilot\u2019s voice crackled into the operation room, all other\
  \ Indian Navy ships and airborne helicopters in the vicinity were informed about\
  \ a course correction so as to ensure a swift interception of the criminal ship.\
  \ As the convoy hemmed in around the errant vessel that was sighted around 4 am,\
  \ the commandos made their way through the choppy waters. Senior officers strained\
  \ their eyes through night binoculars for any sign of an armed struggle and tense\
  \ moments passed by in complete silence after the commandos fanned out to various\
  \ areas of the \u201Cenemy vessel\u201D. It was only after the radio confirmed complete\
  \ control of the \u201Cmiscreant\u201D ship that the Captain ordered refreshments\
  \ for everyone concerned at the control room.\n\nThe ship now swung much worse than\
  \ before. I remembered that while extending the invitation, the Naval chief had\
  \ stated my sea journey would change my perspective of life. He was right as the\
  \ journey had been unlike anything I had undertaken before and I realised humanity\
  \ existed at the mercy of the sea and that water has limitless power to nourish\
  \ as well as extinguish human life. In spite of the gigantic strides made by technology,\
  \ the ocean can still decimate a 40,000 ton aircraft carrier as easily as it humbled\
  \ bamboo boats in the Paleolithic age! The solemn understanding made me bow to the\
  \ courageous warriors who toiled on these ferocious frontiers only to allow us to\
  \ sleep peacefully on land."
