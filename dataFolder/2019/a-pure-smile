Text: "I often think, life, there will be a lot of four months ,is likely to be full\
  \ of elegant smell the hard work of learning time, may be sending out the fragrance\
  \ of pleasure in love time, may be warm heart and family together of the sweet time,\
  \ but never have this kind of golden Malaysia of counting the days of sunshine out\
  \ of the four months. Yes, counting the days. No more, no less, 98 days for my oversea\
  \ study. Life does have a lot to look forward to in the domestic period.\n\nWhen\
  \ I was sitting on the Malaysia airlines, I was in a nervous mood, including the\
  \ joy of going abroad, the fear of Malaysia airlines' anxiety, and the expectation\
  \ of Malaysia. Even though I thought I had crossed the international line when I\
  \ woke up, I didn't lose any feeling of being sleepy until the stewardess woke me\
  \ up for lunch.It was supposed to be the first real Malay meal, with dried fish,\
  \ shrimp and rice mixed with a strange spicy sauce, yogurt and fruit. The air is\
  \ filled with the fishy smell of hot sauce, which is quite different from the aroma\
  \ of Chinese chili. I thought it might accompany my time in Malaysia. After the\
  \ meal, I happened to see the little boy sitting on the other side of the aisle\
  \ after dinner closed his eyes and folded his hands in prayer, his eyelashes are\
  \ very long, look deeply religious. This was the first time I experienced the impact\
  \ of culture and religion on living habits. I think religion may not be a bad thing,\
  \ it's just a change in one's beliefs and way of life. People with faith may be\
  \ happy, after all, they can hold on to the silver lining of the god they believe\
  \ in in despair. Then I met someone in Malaysia who changed my mind -- but that's\
  \ another story.\n\nWhen I arrived in UMS (Universiti Malaysia Sabah), I couldn\u2019\
  t wait to visit the UMS Mosque , where I met a group of children, I didn't ask about\
  \ their age, about six or seven years old, they have already worn hijab. When I\
  \ stepped on the smooth floor, they just gave me a strange look. I hadn't realized\
  \ what was wrong. Then they try to use sign language to gesture me to take off shoes\
  \ before entering the mosque, I suddenly realized this problem, later, They relaxed\
  \ vigilance to me, and I put my backpack on the floor there,looked around and took\
  \ pictures, my memory as if stopped working in this beautiful mosque, when I left\
  \ in a half way and discovered that my backpack was still in mosque, generally speaking,\
  \ in this case, the possibility of finding my backpack is almost zero. I was heading\
  \ to the mosque in rush steps and suddenly I was stopped by a Malay accent voice\
  \ , then I heard the voice of the group of children followed  \u2018It\u2019s her\
  \ \uFF01It\u2019s her!\u2019I was told by a security guard that group of children\
  \ helped me to send a backpack to the lost-and-found office.Those children, had\
  \ always been there waiting for me to come back till I got my backpack, that group\
  \ of children happily jumped up, cheering, my eyes have been tears of control dim,\
  \ they smiled,that is the most specially pure smile I have ever gotten, after farewell,\
  \ I left.\n\n\u2018Will we be seeing again?\u2019\n\u2018Yes!\u2019  \n\u2018Unlike\
  \ other Chinese, we don't have the superiority of powerful people, so we are willing\
  \ to get along with you\u2019. This sentence impressed me deeply. Chinese people\
  \ all have a Chinese dream and hope that China will become strong enough to stand\
  \ tall among the nations of the world. But in fact the so-called strong and weak\
  \ countries are only relative. I do not know whether some of our compatriots have\
  \ lost their due modesty. China's growing strength does not mean that we should\
  \ look down upon the country. On the contrary, we should be more humble and absorb\
  \ some shining advantages of other countries."
