Text: "31/08/2018 \n\nIt's a sultry day of August and I\u2019m about to leave for\
  \ my ten months Erasmus exchange in Bordeaux, France. All summer I\u2019ve been\
  \ waiting for this moment and suddenly I don\u2019t want to leave anymore. I try\
  \ to procrastinate packing as much as I can and I already feel homesick, I already\
  \ miss my everyday life, the smell of rag\xF9 sauce on Sunday mornings, my dear\
  \ old habits and my family. I'm making a leap into the unknown for the first time\
  \ in my life. Finally I find the courage I need and here I am at the airport with\
  \ my inseparable backpack, so many emotions and as many questions: will I be able\
  \ to stay away from home for so many months? Will I be able to make new friends\
  \ and learn a new language? Well, at this point there was only one way to find it\
  \ out: take that flight and leave.\n\n25/02/2019\n\nIt's already been six months\
  \ since that day. It is not always easy to stay away from that place that I used\
  \ to call home, but I'm living the best moment of my life, there is no doubt about\
  \ this. I still have to complete my experience here and yet I want to leave for\
  \ new horizons, for new leaps in the unknown: because there is nothing more beautiful\
  \ than the moment before leaving for a new place.\nI love getting lost in the small\
  \ streets of this beautiful gray city and stop in front of the boulangerie windows\
  \ to admire the freshly baked golden croissants and pains au chocolate. Bordeaux\
  \ is slightly degraded but so fascinating to me. My favorite scenario is undoubtedly\
  \ the sunset on Place de la Bourse and the explosion of a hundred colors reflected\
  \ in the Miroir d\u2019eau, the world\u2019s largest reflecting pool. That is the\
  \ moment when the ground looks exactly like the sky: it's such a breathtaking sight\
  \ that any photograph would not be able to capture what my eyes can see, so I just\
  \ stop to observe the beauty of this moment for the millionth time since I\u2019\
  m here, only me and my unstoppable flow of thoughts. All I want is to capture this\
  \ moment and impress these images in my mind."
