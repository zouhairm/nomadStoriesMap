Text: "Our 1980 Ford Econoline camper van retained some of its original charm with\
  \ crushed red velvet curtains for every window and wood panelling throughout. The\
  \ grey exterior hinted at many years of travel and adventure, with rusty blemishes\
  \ having popped up along various places on the side and rear panels. We knew when\
  \ we bought the van second hand, that there was the possibility of some minor mechanical\
  \ issues popping up. Our journey would take a couple months, and take us from the\
  \ middle of Canada, to the coast and down into California. What my boyfriend Troy\
  \ and I weren't entirely planning on, was spending the better part of a week sleeping\
  \ in the parking lot of a mechanical shop. Our radiator had blown. And it went out\
  \ in the most glorious of fashions; an ominous grey cloud of smoke rising up from\
  \ the hood and a constant drip of vibrant green liquid from the underside of the\
  \ van. \n\nWe were lucky and got towed into our destination of Bishop, California,\
  \ the closest town to the Buttermilks, the Happys and the Sads. The Buttermilks\
  \ is a world-class bouldering destination; an area full of enormous beautiful boulders,\
  \ peppering a desert valley with the snow capped Sierra mountain range standing\
  \ guard in the distance. The majority of these \"highballs\" are daunting for even\
  \ experienced climbers, so being fairly new to the world of climbing, I suspected\
  \ I would feel a little more at ease climbing in the Happys and Sads. The Happys\
  \ and Sads consist of slightly smaller volcanic boulders filling long, narrow canyons.\
  \ \n\nClimbers are inherently friendly people, eager to help those in the community,\
  \ and after two nights in the parking lot, we got a ride out to the Buttermilks.\
  \ It is easy to forget time surrounded by these giants, the silence only broken\
  \ by the sounds of planes overhead and climbers in the distance encouraging each\
  \ other on projects. We fell into a routine over the next few days of hitching a\
  \ ride to whichever climbing spot a passing group was headed to, or spending time\
  \ on Main Street. Troy and I enjoyed exploring the unique shops and taking in the\
  \ rustic charm of the small desert town. After the radiator was replaced, we drove\
  \ to Main Street to indulge in wine and frozen yogurt at a cute boutique cafe to\
  \ celebrate our new and slightly unwanted radiator. \n\nWe eagerly spent a couple\
  \ nights camping just off Buttermilk Road and worked on a few boulder projects.\
  \ After almost two weeks in Bishop, it was time to continue on our journey. It is\
  \ not uncommon for climbers to have unfinished projects around the world; and I\
  \ was now, in my mind, part of this community of people with a growing list of places\
  \ to visit and projects to return to. It will only be a matter of time before I\
  \ return to be in awe of these giant boulders once again, and fingers crossed, with\
  \ a functioning radiator."
