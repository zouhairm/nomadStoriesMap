Text: "I had never ventured so far away on my own before; yet something seemed so\
  \ close to home - something almost warm and comforting. It was not the sun, though\
  \ it indeed shone gloriously in the sapphire sky. It was not the blood pumping through\
  \ my veins, though they indeed felt as though they had started to dance with excitement.\n\
  Onwards I descended through the non-existent pathway as I let my own two feet carve\
  \ their tracks in the dirt below. This was not a road well trodden. Rays of sunlight\
  \ barely broke the flora and fauna either side, causing the leaves to glisten like\
  \ the night sky as the light caressed their surface and the breeze enticed them\
  \ to dance the samba.\nSlipping on a mossy rock, I grabbed a nearby branch to steady\
  \ my balance. After fully recovering my stance I allowed my glance to drift upward.\
  \ I had found my way to the end of the pathway and emerged into a picturesque clearing\
  \ on a secluded beach. \nNobody had been here for a while as was evident in the\
  \ overgrown pathway I had just left behind me. The sand had no trace of footprints,\
  \ instead it stretched itself out in front of me like a blanket, longing to feel\
  \ a human touch once more. I could hear the waves crashing against the cliffs on\
  \ the opposite side of the beach - almost like a crowd of people encouraging me\
  \ to peruse this long forgotten wonder.\nAs I took my first step in the sand, the\
  \ feeling of familiarity washed over me once again. Had I been here before? \nI\
  \ was a fifteen year old child on a family holiday to a place we had never visited\
  \ before; how could this long forgotten beach seem familiar? It couldn't. And yet,\
  \ the feeling of knowing could not be shaken from my mind.\nI slowly made my way\
  \ through the warm sand and took a seat in front of a huge rock that stood a few\
  \ meters away from the waters edge. The rock had being heavily graffitied in times\
  \ gone by and various pictures and lettering were sprawled across the surface. One\
  \ could only imagine how long some of these markings have weathered time. Tracing\
  \ various letters with the tip of my finger I spotted something that piqued my curiosity\
  \ to untold extremes. Two separate names crudely written in black permanent marker\
  \ pen.\n \"Tereza and Jorge.\"\nIt happened upon me that this beach was familiar\
  \ to me - not from a previous visit or from a photograph, but from a story; a story\
  \ I had been told many times by my father before his death. This was the beach where\
  \ my parents fell in love so many years prior. \nThis was home."
