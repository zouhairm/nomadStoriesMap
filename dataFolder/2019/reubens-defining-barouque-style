Text: "As a easy route to Italy, I landed in Munich for a day to be showered with\
  \ rain. Museum was the only option and I choose the Alte Pinacothek knowing the\
  \ history of the largest Reubens collection. It is located in the Kunstareal area\
  \ which is 10 mins by the 27 tram from the Munich railway station. A beautiful old\
  \ building awaits us and and I had to walk ahead since the entrance is on the other\
  \ side facing the public garden which is part of the museum. Right after entering\
  \ you go straight to the ticket counter for the ticket which is 7 euros and collect\
  \ the audio guide from the next counter. it is useful as I really didnt expect the\
  \ treasure trove that awaited me inside the gallery.\n\nBaroque art can capture\
  \ your attention with the grandeur that it presents itself in. And no artist does\
  \ it better than the flemish artist Peter Paul Reubens. Every painting from the\
  \ \u2018Massacre of the Innocents\u2019I first laid my eyes on ,it has been a study\
  \ to understand this artist. His every painting has emotion etched in it. You feel\
  \ the very essence of the topic he was trying to convey through his art. It is fitting\
  \ that he inspired many of the great artist after his time.\n\nThis museum has 72\
  \ of his masterpieces. The largest single collection of Reubens in a museum in the\
  \ whole world. The power his paintings make you a real witness at the site of action.\
  \ The \u2018massacre of innocents\u2019, \u2018the great last judgement\u2019, \u2018\
  hippopotamus and crocodile\u2019,\u2019rape of the daughters of Leucippus\u2019\
  \ give the same emotional turmoil to its viewers that is intended to convey . Its\
  \ an experience that is intellectual and emotional. \n\nArte Pinacothek has one\
  \ of the rarest collection of paintings including that of Giotto, Albert Durer,\
  \ Antony van dyck, Carravagio, Brugheal and the Reubens paintings are just the tip\
  \ of the iceberg. The experience was unexpected and I will cherish it as I follow\
  \ my study that will take me to every Reubens painting in existance."
