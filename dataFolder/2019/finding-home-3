Text: "No running water, outhouses and a fold out bed with a mattress one inch think\
  \ was my standard of living when I came to a remote village just touching the Yukon\
  \ River in the middle of Alaska. \nMy life there was about fishing, gardening, finding\
  \ edible mushrooms and eating everything we would harvest. \n \nAfter three weeks\
  \ it was time for further travel. I arrived to the closest city, Fairbanks. I had\
  \ a shower, without having to boil water and use a bucket. I crawled into my thick-mattress\
  \ bed with a soft pillow. I closed my eyes and wondered 'why did I leave?'\nThat\
  \ place had become my home. I had become comfortable and the relationships of those\
  \ around me had grown important. Cupped between mountains and a never-ending forest,\
  \ that village of 200 residents was a world in itself. \n \nBut now I was alone.\n\
  I had planned a trip to the furthest point north of Alaska. From the city of Fairbanks,\
  \ it is roughly 500km by car. And then by plane to the furthest town, Barrow. \n\
  There were only two buses a week, so I organised to stop half way, then catch the\
  \ next bus. \nEight long hours later we made it to Coldfoot. It had been raining,\
  \ and due to the high number of trucks that stop by for something to eat, the ground\
  \ had become a bed of mud and you could only hear the squelching combination of\
  \ water and dirt beneath the tires. \n\u201CI am so glad I am not staying here,\
  \ with all this mud. Do you have a tarp? How are you going to camp?\u201D asked\
  \ an older passenger.   \n\u201CThat patch of grass over there looked pretty good.\u201D\
  \ I replied, trying to sound unbothered and happy, in attempt to make myself actually\
  \ feel that way. \nSurprisingly and fortunately the patch of grass contained no\
  \ signs of mud and was relatively dry. I set up my tent, grabbed some maps from\
  \ the info center then made my way over to the only restaurant for some food. I\
  \ asked one of the servers if he knew of any good hikes and after looking over some\
  \ maps he invited me to go hiking with him the next day.\nThe hike went very well.\
  \ That evening I met some of the other employees as they all hung out at the staff\
  \ lounge tent. Later I was introduced to the boss who owned a group of Husky sled\
  \ dogs. As it was summer, they didn\u2019t get much exercise. He introduced me to\
  \ Birdie, a beautiful husky who I could take off leash for walks, wherever, whenever.\
  \ \nMy four days at Coldfoot consisted of hours of walking through the forest with\
  \ Birdie, making friends with the restaurant staff, fishing and exploring a nearby\
  \ village with a new friend. \n \nAnd then I left again. \nWhen I made it to Barrow,\
  \ I lay on my bed at the very modern and pricey hotel (it was too cold and windy\
  \ to camp here). I stared at the polar bear photographs on the wall. I felt empty\
  \ and lost. \nI choose to travel by myself because I enjoy my own company and the\
  \ freedom that it entails. But I could not understand this feeling \u2013 the desire\
  \ to explore yet an attachment to the people (and dogs) I met. \nI decided to rest\
  \ my eyes for a while and eventually I got up. I went to the literal furthest point\
  \ north, a small stretch of land and listened to my enthusiastic taxi driver who\
  \ gave me a short history lesson on Barrow, photographed me and encouraged me to\
  \ jump up as high as I could while he took shots of me against the broad arctic\
  \ ocean. \nTravelling by yourself means you are essentially alone. But the more\
  \ I travel the more I realise that finding a home, a place where you feel connected\
  \ and comfortable, is less about the destination and more about the relationships\
  \ you make. \nThough I often feel sad once I leave a place, or a person, it also\
  \ brings me happiness. Feeling this means I was comfortable and that I\u2019d found\
  \ a home."
