Text: "In the Pacific, border guards say that we have beautiful passports and ask\
  \ where the mysterious and distant country \u201CKazakhstan\u201D is located. Yet,\
  \ as it turned out, a beautiful passport is not a panacea for all problems, but\
  \ rather the opposite. Aliens from Kazakhstan arouse suspicion and mistrust. After\
  \ four days of travel and three countries behind, we finally arrived in Majuro,\
  \ the Marshall Islands to attend special research workshop. Everything that happened\
  \ then resembles scenes from a blockbuster where we play the role of spies who fell\
  \ into the hands of the FBI. The border guards said that they do not know anything\
  \ about our country and the visa obtained at the American embassy is not valid.\
  \ By a collective decision, the immigration service decided to drive us out of the\
  \ territory as soon as possible: they stopped the plane which was supposed to fly\
  \ away half an hour ago and forced us to get on it by threatening with a prison\
  \ in case of disobedience. Realizing the futility of our attempts to explain anything,\
  \ I quickly headed towards the ramp. \u201CDo not turn around,\u201D I thought to\
  \ myself and climbed aboard.\n\nThe distance between the water and the plane is\
  \ rapidly decreasing, and suddenly I hear a thump of the landing gears contacted\
  \ with the ground. I realized that we have landed safely on another island.   Although\
  \ it is difficult to call it \u201Csafely\u201D as it turned out that the plane\
  \ is broken, and another one would arrive only in the evening. Moist hot tropical\
  \ air enveloped the skin. Hello, Pompey. Later we found out that Guam, Chuuk, and\
  \ Pompey \u2013 all of the islands where we stopped on our way represent Federated\
  \ States of Micronesia, an archipelago in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The border\
  \ guard phlegmatically put a stamp in the passport, without asking any questions\
  \ and we entered the territory of Pompey.  Suddenly, we heard our names called in\
  \ the loudspeakers. We approached the girl who called us preparing for the worst.\
  \ However, the universe apparently loves us. The girl informed us that we had officially\
  \ received permission to enter Majuro and the next flight would be tomorrow afternoon.\
  \ Hooray. \nA direct asphalt road led us to the Pompey Hotel. Hotel in Pompey is\
  \ far from the usual concept of hotels \u2013 these are ordinary huts or small rooms\
  \ with shabby furniture. In general, quite exotic. We decided to have dinner somewhere,\
  \ and the driver from the hotel took us to the nearest cafe of Japanese cuisine.\
  \ We finally enjoyed tasty and hot food.\n\nAfter 12 hours of flight, we finally\
  \ arrived in Majuro. \u201CIt's time for you to start a travel blog,\u201D laughed\
  \ Jessie at the airport. \u201CWhy not?\u201D I thought. \nMarshall Islands is like\
  \ another planet. The beauty of the nature here blinded my eyes. Blue colorful lagoons,\
  \ coral reefs and the endless ocean... I cannot believe that people carried out\
  \ nuclear tests in this area. Today the Marshall Islands holds a ceremony to celebrate\
  \ the 60th anniversary of nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll. I look at the people\
  \ around me - of different nationalities, age, and gender. I catch myself thinking\
  \ that, no matter what, we must keep peace and never repeat past mistakes.\n\nOn\
  \ the way back from the ceremony to the hotel, we heard the choir singing in the\
  \ local church. Children were dancing in a circle, holding hands and singing \"\
  Hallelujah\". Old man sitting at the entrance to the church asked where I came from.\
  \ \u201CKazakhstan,\u201D I replied. \u201CI know one person from Kazakhstan. A\
  \ very good man,\u201D he said. I will never forget the warmth in his calm direct\
  \ look.\n\nMidnight. We are riding on the back of the pickup truck. The wind blows\
  \ my hair. Never before have had I felt the immensity of this world as deeply as\
  \ here. We are approaching the end of the island and it feels like we are at the\
  \ edge of the world: myriads of stars in the sky reflect in the water of the ocean.\
  \ The horizon between them is erased. Only infinite universe around. And we are\
  \ all part of it."
