Text: "To start, the ground was covered in leaves. Of all colors, mainly yellow, red\
  \ and orange. \n\nThe streets were similar between themselves with their houses\
  \ with long beautiful staircases. It\u2019s unique, as residents say, and who am\
  \ I to disagree.\nIn my first day, I went to the historical center of this town\
  \ and I witnessed a story being folded and unfolded as I found myself in what they\
  \ call the Old Port, or, in Quebecois, their Vieux Port. There, in October's blooming\
  \ autumn, I said hello to the beautiful St Laurent river, while admiring its magnificence.\
  \ It's an island, after all. I'm in Montr\xE9al, I thought.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve never\
  \ seen an island with so many different people walking by : Chinese, Arabs, Mexicans,\
  \ Indians, Brazilians. All languages were spoken while we all, together, passed\
  \ through the past of this place - the Old Clock Tower, the beautiful Chateau Ramesay\
  \ with all its history. We were collecting memories from the past and making our\
  \ own ones, blended in one of the most welcoming cities in the world. In that moment,\
  \ I felt union and awe as in that place I contemplated beauty mixed between history,\
  \ nature, architecture. We are in Montr\xE9al, I thought. \n\nThrough that time,\
  \ I\u2019ve been to it all \u2013 a Botanical Garden whistling in colors at autumn,\
  \ the Mont Royal, who gave name to the metropolis, the Oratoire Saint Joseph crowded\
  \ with people, faith and good deems, the Basilique Notre-Dame de Montr\xE9al with\
  \ its undescriptive beauty. I learnt a few words in French, and my \u201Cgood mornings\u201D\
  \ to the bus drivers became happy \u201Cbonjours\u201D which were well received,\
  \ since French is their first and beloved language here.\n\nThere were 25 days living\
  \ and going about this wonderful town and, beyond touristic sites and areas, I could\
  \ see the day to day living. The smell of poutine. The sound of the metro\u2019\
  s arrival, the arr\xEAts. The pride in keeping the French language alive. The 6\
  \ pm rush. The taste of maple syrup in pretty much everything. The daily weather\
  \ talk. The stories of people who were there from decades ago and from the ones\
  \ who were arriving just now. One by one, they told me how this city received and\
  \ treated them well and how glad they are to be there Of how, of all places in the\
  \ world, they\u2019re happy to be here. They live in Montr\xE9al, I thought. In\
  \ my farewells to what was my first trip abroad, while the airplane prepared itself\
  \ to set its long flight, the memories of it all blended and I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but wish I could, one day, come back and live there too."
