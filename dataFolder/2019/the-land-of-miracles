Text: "It was a hot July day in 2008 when I arrived in Bangelor for the first time.\
  \ The weather was scorching but the driver who was waiting for me was wearing a\
  \ leather jacket on. As we hit the road to Mysore(my destination) I saw a bus filled\
  \ with people and its top roof was covered with people sitting there. \nAlong the\
  \ way the driver stopped at a very small and shabby shop , came out and asked me\
  \ if I drank tea and I said yes coz I wanted to mingle from the beginning having\
  \ no clue of what awaited me. I looked inside the shop and saw that the small tin\
  \ tea cups were put inside a big pot pf water and  taken out by a man who was in\
  \ charge of washing them and that was the whole process of washing the cups! I wanted\
  \ to yell and say that I have changed my mind to the driver, but it was already\
  \ too late! He was walking toward the car holding a tea cup while wiping his sweat\
  \ drops off his face. He offered the tea with a smile, I looked at it again and\
  \ told myself: if you don\u2019t drink it you cannot enjoy this two year trip to\
  \ India, I closed my eyes and drank the tea in one sip. And it was the beginning\
  \ of my evergreen adventure in the magical land of India!"
