Text: "I always dreamed of going to a solo trip but nothing was in my favor like my\
  \ income, time, family acceptance etc. I took an initiative last year in April.\
  \ I started gathering money each month from my little income and I decided to go\
  \ alone for a tour before I go to abroad for higher study. One day I saw a post\
  \ in a group for Bhutan trip. Suddenly it stuck in my mind. After lots of tension\
  \ and thoughts, I went to the trip alone with that group of 24 people. I didn\u2019\
  t know anyone in the bus. I event didn\u2019t know the travel guide properly. With\
  \ a dream of a solo traveler I started my journey. In the bus, I got some people\
  \ very friendly and I felt relaxed a little bit. When the bus was stopped for freshen\
  \ up, I met some more people. But all those things didn\u2019t matter that much\
  \ because I was enjoying my travel. I can\u2019t explain how I felt in the mid night.\
  \ I was not scared a little bit. I was enjoying everything, even one small cup of\
  \ tea which was not tasted that good. Then we reach at the border, changed the bus\
  \ and headed towards Bhutan. After a long journey of around 27 hours, we reached\
  \ to Phuntsholing at 7 pm on the next day. The place was so neat and clean and the\
  \ food we took for dinner was amazing. That day we couldn\u2019t see the city properly\
  \ but I felt good with so many unknown people. On the second day, I along with the\
  \ group did many sightseeing in phuntsholing. The hill was mixed with the cloud,\
  \ the river was flowing like a spring, the roads and the people were amazing. All\
  \ the religious places of Buddhists were so peaceful and so relaxed to feel. Then\
  \ we headed towards the capital Thimpu. A very beautiful city. We stayed there for\
  \ 2 days. First day, we went to the Tashichho Dzong- the place was full covered\
  \ with fog. Such a romantic place I didn\u2019t imagine. Then we went to the biggest\
  \ Buddha Dordenna. A place with thousands of golden symbols- I don\u2019t know what\
  \ I can call it. It was one of the amazing things I have ever seen. Then while returning\
  \ we roamed around the whole city and did some shopping. Most the time I was roaming\
  \ alone because I was enjoying everything. On the next day, I had experienced a\
  \ new thing of my life. Water rafting in Mo chhu river. And the experience was outstanding.\
  \ Then we went to the beautiful Punakha Dzong.We  visited every corner of the place.\
  \ Such a beautiful structure. And the last charm of the day was Punakha Suspension\
  \ Bridge- I can\u2019t express my feelings when I went there. I walked for a long\
  \ time but I forgot all the pain after reaching there. In the 5th day, we went to\
  \ the beautiful city paro and the toughest thing of the journey happened. Tiger\u2019\
  s nest- the very famous place in Bhutan. We Hiked for 4 hours to ride on around\
  \ 10,000 km hill. The path was too dangerous but the beauty was eye soothing. How\
  \ can I forget my ride on horse for the first time though it was for few minutes.\
  \ At the end we roamed around the city and it was raining, so we couldn\u2019t see\
  \ properly. And the last day during coming back from Paro to Phuntsheling, we stopped\
  \ in a beautiful place where the hills were like never ending in height. And the\
  \ food of Bhutan is really amazing. I don\u2019t know how many pictures I captured.\
  \ I enjoyed the whole tour very much. And I feel really good whenever I think of\
  \ that tour. The nature, the hills, the spring, the river, the Dzongs- everything\
  \ was so perfect that I couldn\u2019t imagine. I really didn\u2019t expect to enjoy\
  \ that much. But for a travel lover like me, place doesn\u2019t matter. I can find\
  \ beauty in any place with or without anyone. And Bhutan is really an amazing place\
  \ to visit. The tour of 7 days (Including journey) was nothing  but a dream for\
  \ me."
