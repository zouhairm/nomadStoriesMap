Text: "The sky was filled with heavy, grey clouds as we got out of our rental car\
  \ and walked several miles to the edge of the Cliffs of Moher. A chilling mist was\
  \ blowing against us in sheets as we approached our goal. We adored it all; the\
  \ atmosphere, the smells, the sights, the sounds. Everything. The Cliffs seemed\
  \ to feel our excitement and joy and welcomed us, alongside the weather\u2019s stormy\
  \ ambiance, to explore our new adventure. \nMy husband and I were in the middle\
  \ of our ten-day honeymoon in Ireland. We came to the Emerald Isle on a red-eye\
  \ flight from our home state of New York, before deciding where in the country we\
  \ wanted to go. Our plan was to not make plans; simply rent a car, stay in different\
  \ cities and towns as we see fit and take each day as a new day to explore something\
  \ new. Day five consisted of the Cliffs of Moher.\nWe approached the Cliffs\u2019\
  \ edge quicker than we anticipated. The land lay before us for the next several\
  \ miles when suddenly, there it was. A deep, 700 feet drop to the water\u2019s crest\
  \ below. I gasped in awe at nature\u2019s beauty that lay in gorgeous patterns before\
  \ us. To my right, a lookout tower stood erect about a mile away. To my left, the\
  \ cliffs stretched on to what seemed like an eternity, rolling in strong, powerful\
  \ curves of rock. They stood, massive, against the water\u2019s waves, which crashed\
  \ against them far below. My heart became one with the body of the Cliffs. I stretched\
  \ my arms out and let the wind play with my hair, and the sleeves of my raincoat,\
  \ as I breathed in the damp, yet heavenly, air. I stuck my tongue out and tasted\
  \ the salty air, as a breeze of chilling mist brushed my face. \nWe ventured off\
  \ the beaten path, down onto a gigantic rock, which had become one with the cliff\
  \ we stood on, many years ago. My husband sat down on the edge of the cliff and\
  \ swung his legs out over the water and back in against the rock. I watched him\
  \ as he looked down at the vast depth that lay between him and the water. He smiled\
  \ as he looked up toward the horizon. I smiled too. We were meant to be here, on\
  \ this day in June 2018, to experience the Cliffs when the atmosphere was filled\
  \ with wild, playful adventure, and our hearts were filled with it too. The other\
  \ nine days that we explored the lush, green country, the weather gave us a cheeky\
  \ smile. Lots of sunshine shone brightly over the country, showing us the way through\
  \ the cities and towns. Cheeky indeed, as this type of weather is unusual for Ireland\
  \ in June.\nWe couldn\u2019t see much of the country, in fact, we barely saw one-third,\
  \ but we did get to explore Dublin, Kilkenny, Kilfenora and Galway. However, standing\
  \ at the edge of the Cliffs of Moher spoke to me the most out of our ten-day adventure.\
  \ My traveler\u2019s heart has always wanted more, ever since I was a little girl\
  \ living all over the world, in my military family. Yet for the few hours that we\
  \ explored the Cliffs, my thirst was quenched. The Cliffs pushed me out of my comfort\
  \ zone of my usual encounters with local people, quaint shop explorations and learning\
  \ the traditions of a different country. They led me, quite literally, to the edge\
  \ of my imagination and wildest dreams and encouraged me to pursue more. As I stood\
  \ on the edge, eyes taking in the incredible views around me, the Cliffs spoke to\
  \ me. They sent me a message through the wind. My ear tickled as I heard them say\
  \ \u201CDream big, darling. This world is full of wonder. You have so much to see.\
  \ Get on with it.\u201D I\u2019m happy to say I obeyed."
