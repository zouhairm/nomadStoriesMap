Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find a tramp to my way back home.\nI had noticed him\
  \ walking past me when I\u2019ve sat down that old dying palm, hopeless and disoriented,\
  \ my forehead sweating and my tongue bitten in a hit of rage.\nIt was my first time\
  \ volunteering abroad and this na\xEFve twenty \u2013 two years old girl had imagined\
  \ herself living wild and crazy adventures like she was starring \u201CPoint break\u201D\
  \ movie.\nThe first family contacting me from Spain seemed perfect: Scottish people\
  \ trying to manage their brand new lives in the suburbia of the fresh easy \u2013\
  \  going Alicante, why not? \nThey were even more than willing to pick me up from\
  \ the airport, show me the unknown treasures of the land, and they had lovely Spanish\
  \ neighbors.\nSo for weeks I\u2019ve been thinking about the experience more as\
  \ an almost free vacation than a fair exchange where I was supposed to work for\
  \ a bed and three meals.\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me, it was my fault, or better\u2026\
  \ my imagination\u2019s fault.\nVolunteering is always both sweet and bitter, you\
  \ know you\u2019re entering someone else\u2019s house, you have rules to respect,\
  \ and you must be as much helpful as possible.\nI would have learnt it the following\
  \ days.\nThat second day, after realizing I was actually going to live in Sax, a\
  \ little \u201Cpueblo\u201D in the middle of Nowhere (Nowhere means the Mountain\u2019\
  s chain of Sierra del Cid in this case), I was still metabolizing what a Workaway\
  \ is supposed to be. And what being independent and take care of yourself as a solo\
  \ traveler  is too.\nWalking under the heat of middle August sun in south Spain\
  \ (another wrong evaluation of mine) through the rough and desert landscape towards\
  \ the center of the town, I found suddenly myself lost.\nNo signals, no streets,\
  \ neither a compass pointing to north; only chameleonic rocks that turned from golden\
  \ to pink to purple shades, and a bridge whose walls were covered by tags and colorful\
  \ graffiti .\nI passed past the bridge and, after a while, I fell literally on my\
  \ butt.\nMiserable.\nI started crying, because it wasn\u2019t as I had imagined,\
  \ as I had planned. I didn\u2019t expect to find that scenario.\nI didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to feel so lonely, and so angry with myself; I didn\u2019t expect to feel like\
  \ I was wasting two precious weeks of my summer, far from friends and relatives,\
  \ far from my bravery and my concept of an amazing solo trip.\nAnd when I was approaching\
  \ to the bridge, trying to come back to my host\u2019s home and make the most of\
  \ the experience, I saw him.\nThat tramp had noticed me crying under the palm, all\
  \ alone and unarmed, a stupid wanderer that wasn\u2019t aware of all the dangers\
  \ that could possibly occur.\nI swallowed, convincing myself it was a casualty.\
  \ Nevertheless, what was he waiting for? Up to the hills there are only my hosts\
  \ and few neighbors I had already met, and He was none of them.\nAs I walked past\
  \ the bridge, feeling his nasty eyes on me, I saw him standing up and starting following\
  \ me.\nI thought: it\u2019s done, this is the end.\nNo one will hear you, no one\
  \ will come saving you.\nAs I walked faster, he speeded up.\nThen, I ran.\nFastest\
  \ Than I have ever run before, praying the gods to protect me.\nWhen I came back\
  \ home, I felt disappointed. I didn\u2019t want to feel like that anymore, only\
  \ because I am a girl and I am full of bad news about what happens to female solo\
  \ traveler every now and then.\nOut of there, I didn\u2019t expect to find out a\
  \ way to get out of my reassuring comfortable bubble, to open the eye and become\
  \ less na\xEFve.\n I scrolled my shoulders, reset that awful moment from my head\
  \ and started with a new mindset: I spent the following days working, chatting with\
  \ local people, traveling on my free days and meditate from the top of those stunning\
  \ hills, breathing the air of the land that made me a bolder yet mature and conscious\
  \ Workawayer."
