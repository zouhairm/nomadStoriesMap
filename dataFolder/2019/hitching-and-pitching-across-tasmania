Text: "When Tom first suggested we hitch across Tasmania, I was hesitant. Tom (23),\
  \ and me (36) met hiking the length of New Zealand on the Te Araroa Trail the previous\
  \ year, where we\u2019d hitchhiked out of necessity from the trail into towns and\
  \ back. I was broke when I was twenty-three as well. But with a steady income and\
  \ enough money for a bus ticket, I felt somewhat fraudulent and immoral to live\
  \ like a vagabond with no roof over my head or means of transportation. \n\nOur\
  \ only direction and objective were to explore as many of Tasmania\u2019s nineteen\
  \ National Parks as possible during our thirty-day visit on the cheap. All I was\
  \ carrying was a five-kilogram rucksack and a tent, and with no itinerary or agenda\
  \ in my back pocket, I felt as light as a feather. But I had some hesitations about\
  \ the unknowns ahead. Where we\u2019d eat, sleep, and shit each day would be in\
  \ the hands of a stranger behind the wheel. \n\nUpon arrival we stood by the roadside\
  \ on the outskirts of Launceston, holding our thumbs out with bright eyes and eager\
  \ smiles. My arm began to cramp within the first few minutes, and I couldn\u2019\
  t help but become doubtful of our success, sweating in the unseasonable temperatures\
  \ the island was experiencing in the final week of January 2019, when bushfires\
  \ were raging through half the state. \n\nI was about to suggest we catch a bus,\
  \ when a red pick-up truck pulled over, driven by a local man with his four-year-old\
  \ daughter in the back seat. He mentioned he\u2019d driven passed us twice already,\
  \ deciding to swing back because he felt sorry for our unfortunate position along\
  \ Highway 1.\n\u201CYou\u2019ll never get a ride here,\u201D he told us bluntly,\
  \ before driving us ten kilometres south for a better chance.\nThis first ride led\
  \ to countless others, from people as varied as the vehicles they were driving.\n\
  \nI\u2019d arrived with preconceived notions about the types of people who would\
  \ stop for us, assuming they\u2019d be driving painted vans with prayer flags and\
  \ wearing colourful clothing with wooden beads in their hair. But during our 1,500-kilometre\
  \ journey across Australia\u2019s forgotten state, these stereotypes were demolished,\
  \ replaced by the constant surprise of the vastness of people who stopped. \n\n\
  There was Carl, the baker from St Helens, who\u2019d just finished his overnight\
  \ shift at the Banjo\u2019s franchise. A seven-year-old boy named Ancus on a weeklong\
  \ trip from Hong Kong, who was forced to translate for his Chinese father. There\
  \ was the Korean couple with their Dutch friend heading to a campsite in Swansea,\
  \ Leanne from Ballarat in her campervan who made costumes for the local theatre,\
  \ Jimi from Hobart battling depression, Beth and Barb touring the hops plantations\
  \ near Mount Field, Davo the eccentric millionaire from North London, and Karly\
  \ the debt collector, who was a single mother with a two-year-old kid.\n\nThough\
  \ I witnessed the sparkling blue waters of Wineglass Bay, the breathtaking cliffs\
  \ of Cape Pillar, the rusty-orange rocks along the Bay of Fires, and the sun dipping\
  \ its head beneath the horizon from the summit of Cradle Mountain, my greatest memories\
  \ of Tasmania are the people and their stories. The state developed a certain charm\
  \ and character, painted by the portraits of the people who drove us north and south.\n\
  \nEvery ride opened my eyes to something different. I learned about patching phone\
  \ calls in Australia back in the 1960s, where to buy the best pizza in New Norfolk,\
  \ how to sew the arm of a costume so that it slides off in an action sequence, and\
  \ the best place to camp on the Three Capes Track. But everyone we met agreed on\
  \ the same very thing. They all loved Tassie. If they were local, they wanted to\
  \ keep the state a secret, and if they were from the mainland or travelling, they\
  \ were making plans to move there. \n\nI discovered so much more than if we\u2019\
  d rented a car and remained in a tourist bubble. Why people stop to pick up strangers\
  \ remains a mystery to me, but there\u2019s something to be learned from these generous\
  \ people, and I look forward to returning the favour."
