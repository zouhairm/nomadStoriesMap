Text: "PLANNING A ROUND THE WORLD TRIP IN ONE DAY\nMy wife and I had been saving up\
  \ Delta airline miles for years to take a Round The World trip. We needed 285,000\
  \ miles each to fly Business Class to 6 major stops. I had been working in Kansas\
  \ City for FEMA, but the office was shut down during the Christmas and New Year\u2019\
  s holidays. A friend asked me when I was going to plan the trip. I replied: \u201C\
  when I get back to KC after the holidays. That will be my job after work.\u201D\n\
  At 11:30 PM on December 30th 2014, I was watching a college bowl game. Fortunately,\
  \ something made me call Delta to ask if there was a dedicated telephone number\
  \ for the RTW desk. I was told:\u201D No, you have to call the main number and then\
  \ we transfer you. BUT YOU MUST DO THAT TOMORROW!\u201D\nI said: \u201CAre you my\
  \ mother? What is this?\u201D \nHe said: \u201DAfter 15 years, the program ends\
  \ at 9 PM tomorrow\u201D. I immediately, hung up, shut off the TV and ran upstairs\
  \ to get on the computer and flesh out the trip. About 3 AM my wife came into the\
  \ room to see what I was doing. I told her: \u201CCan\u2019t talk now I am planning\
  \ our trip. The program ends tonight.\u201D\nShe replied: \u201CYou\u2019re having\
  \ cancer surgery in 5 hours get some sleep.\u201D\nAt 9AM I began my wait for pathology\
  \ results and called Delta. I was immediately transferred and put on hold. At 10\
  \ AM, while still holding, I was paged to get sewn up. My surgeon had removed the\
  \ cancer. As soon as I got into the room, I asked them to call my wife to come back\
  \ where I was going to be sewn up.\nThe nurse said I couldn\u2019t hold the phone\
  \ while I was being sewn up. I told her: \u201CIf it\u2019s a choice of the phone\
  \ or stitches, I\u2019m sticking with the phone.\u201D Fortunately, my wife made\
  \ it back before the doctor.\nAt 11 AM driving home, I\u2019m still on hold, my\
  \ wife said: \u201C They\u2019re not going to answer, just hang up.\u201D About\
  \ then they answered and I immediately said: \u201CMy phone number is\u2026\u2026\
  \ , please write that down in case I\u2019m disconnected.\u201D She replied: \u201C\
  I can\u2019t do that. As soon as you drop off, the system automatically connects\
  \ the next in line.\u201D\nWe started planning the trip. I gave her the 6 major\
  \ stops: Warsaw, Athens, Johannesburg, Dubai, Moscow and Tokyo. She put it into\
  \ the GPS, then asked when we wanted to fly to Warsaw. I gave here the departure\
  \ from Atlanta. Then she asked what time of day and how long we wanted to stay.\
  \ We came up with 17 days. Then she wanted to know how long we were staying in Athens.\
  \ That was 17 days also, as we were starting in Athens, then on our own going to\
  \ Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro then doing a Greek island hopping before going\
  \ back to Athens.\n\nTHEN I WAS DISCONNECTED. I immediately called Delta back to\
  \ get into the queue again. I emailed Delta as the agent had emailed me the flight\
  \ info for the first 2 legs to prove I was in process and should be able to finish\
  \ even after that day. At 12:30 she miraculously called me since she felt so bad.\
  \ She put the successor on hold and told me when they finished she would call me\
  \ back.\nShe did at 1:15 and we stayed on till completion at 5:15. For each stop\
  \ we had to lock in specific flights on specific days. We only flew Delta the day\
  \ we left Atlanta to JFK and the last day from Tokyo to Atlanta. Otherwise we flew\
  \ Aeroflot, Kenyan, KLM and Korean which is why it took so long accessing partner\
  \ schedules that I couldn\u2019t do. \nSo, in ONE DAY we planned a 4 month almost\
  \ 40,000 mile Round The World trip covering 21 countries, including side trips.\
  \ We visited Poland, Russia, Netherlands, Greece, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, South\
  \ Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe. Kenya, Dubai, Russia, Finland, Estonia,\
  \ Latvia, Lithuania, Korea and Japan."
