Text: "In amongst the high rise buildings in New York City\u2019s Park Avenue, there\
  \ stands a 33.3 foot tall stainless steel sculpture of a human figure; back arched,\
  \ stating up at the sky. It is Tom Friedman\u2019s aptly named piece: \u2018Looking\
  \ Up\u2019. \nI did not need an invitation to imitate this sculpture upon arriving\
  \ in the city that never sleeps. A twenty something year old girl from Dublin, Ireland,\
  \ who had never been in proximity to buildings so towering, my head was thrown back\
  \ towards the clouds from almost the moment my taxi crossed Manhattan Bridge. Indeed,\
  \ if you could gain entry into the Kingdom of Heaven purely by facing it for long\
  \ enough, my place is undoubtedly secure after my fourteen day adventure in the\
  \ \u2018Big Apple\u2019 in Easter of 2016. Walking underneath Rockefeller Plaza\
  \ and Empire, to name but two of NYC\u2019s iconic structures, is awe inducing.\
  \ Of course, during any stay in this city, going to the top of both is almost obligatory,\
  \ and something I would wholeheartedly recommend. To gaze over this vast city from\
  \ such a height is a breathtaking and humbling mental image that will never leave\
  \ you. \nIrish people we have a deep fascination and love for the United States.\
  \ It is an affinity ingrained within us from the knowledge so many of our people\
  \ finding refuge and a home on its shores during our time of famine, and fostered\
  \ by the worldwide fairytale of the American Dream. Of course, New York City is\
  \ seen as the epicenter of this dream. Us Irish flock to the city in our droves,\
  \  returning with pictures of the Statue of Liberty,  magical tales of Broadway\
  \ Shows (I saw the wonderful \u2018Soemthing Rotten\u2019) and boasting hoards of\
  \ clothing that cost us a fraction of the price they would do back home. \nBut for\
  \ me, what I did not expect to find in this city was that it is so much more than\
  \ a place that compels you to look up and around. It is a city that, as a whole,\
  \ looks and moves forward and prompts you to do the same. This was evoked in me\
  \ upon walking through the Easter Parade and Bonnet Festival. Seeing the hundreds\
  \ of people out on the streets in resplendent bonnets on show. These people were\
  \ of a multitude of ethnicities, more so than would be present on your typical Irish\
  \ street. It was a joy to behold and be in the midst of. One particular older woman\
  \ caught my eye. She had a white styrofoam bonnet on her head, grooves cut out for\
  \ a figurine if the Virgin Mary, flowers stuck all around it, the Mexican and American\
  \ flag stuck side by side at the top. \nThis woman found her place here in this\
  \ big city, just as so many of my people did back in the 1840s. They came here looking\
  \ forwards toward a better future and were a significant contingent in building\
  \ this city. \nReaders, if you\u2019re traveling to this wonderful city, remember\
  \ that the true magic of New York is not the buildings, but the people who built\
  \ them and find a home in them. The dream chasing, forward facing nature of these\
  \ people, past and present, enable to the millions of us tourists stand and, just\
  \ like Friedman\u2019s sculpture: look up."
