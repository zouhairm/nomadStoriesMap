Text: "Yugoslavia. For me, born in 97, this name represents a myth. A country that\
  \ no longer existed when I was born, but I remember to listen reporters talking\
  \ about on TV. Surrounded by controversial opinions, a confusing war and urban legends,\
  \ the imaginary behind the land of the Slavs always caught my attention. This is\
  \ part of the story of me, discovering what remains from the Tito\u2019s dream 26\
  \ years after the collapse. \nIn the beginning of May 2018, my crazy days involved\
  \ by the vibrant capital of Serbia were coming to an end. With a list of tips, new\
  \ words in my head and a pocket full of marks, I took a bus straight to Bosnia and\
  \ Herzegovina. Deeply touched by the words I have heard in Belgrade, I convinced\
  \ myself the war was over and the former Yugoslav nations were now living the calm\
  \ after the storm, dipped in social and economic progress. What I found in Sarajevo\
  \ it\u2019s not very representative of it.\nLeaving the Serbian border was quite\
  \ fast - despite of wedding van in front of the bus \u2013 and from that point,\
  \ until arriving in the hills of Sarajevo, I was pledged by amazing natural landscapes:\
  \ deep ravines wrapped in green, an unforgettable turquoise river spotted with big\
  \ rocks, little wood-houses villages and a lot of animals \u2013 sometimes, appearing\
  \ in front of the bus. Well, it was magical, but the ups and downs of the road and\
  \ the age of the bus turned the contact with such natural wonders a real headache.\
  \ (\u2026) The entire scenario was making me feel as if I just have changed planet\
  \ and, very fast, it made me realize that everything I experienced in Serbia should\
  \ not be compared with what I was about to feel in Bosnia\u2026 \nWe were stopping\
  \ all along to leave and collect passengers and it was interesting how communicative\
  \ their eyes were. Without words, I felt how curious and happy  they were about\
  \ me\u2026 unfortunately, I had no time to ask them about the Srpska Republic flags\
  \ I saw around. \nSarajevo It\u2019s magical since the very beginning. (\u2026)\
  \ In minutes, the bus turned into a new street and, as a magic trick, the city appears\
  \ in front of our eyes. There she was: calm, deep and helpless, welcoming all the\
  \ passengers that dropped a fair \u201Cwoow\u201D in unison. This gift was fast\u2026\
  \ as the roller coaster extreme moments. We turned left - close to one of those\
  \ cemeteries made of white crosses along the hills- in order to reach the final\
  \ destination: \u201CIsto\u010Dno Bus Station\u201D. Located behind the hills this\
  \ modern but aged area looked like another city. In fact, decades ago, part of those\
  \ buildings were the Olympic Village Complex for the iconic Winter Games of 1984,\
  \ hosted in Yugoslavia, as a glorious and powerful message of progress! (\u2026\
  ) As if I was not surprised before, finding a way to get in the hostel, I had my\
  \ first real Sarajevo experience. Everything appeared to me as perfect match of\
  \ contrasts and that\u2019s what I always use to resume my journey in the city.\
  \  In front of a bus stop I spotted a house with a graffiti saying \u201CYou forgot\
  \ us, Sarajevo\u201994\u201D, some meters forward, the first building marked by\
  \ shell and bullet craters appeared as if from that point the time entered the city\
  \ stamping a \u201Csouvenir\u201D of his presence all around. I still can feel exactly\
  \ the mess in my mind\u2026 how can this people be so happy and good hosts when\
  \ they live surrounded by this dark memory? How can you smile when the holes in\
  \ the floor where you walk are the grave of people? \n(...) I had de chance to talk\
  \ with survivors of the siege and understand how confuse and \u201Csuicide\u201D\
  \ is the Bosnian political system. Despite of all the efforts made by external forces\
  \ to simplify the \u201CBosnian ethnical question\u201D and take the country to\
  \ the level of progress of the neighbors \u2013 Serbia and Croatia \u2013 this country\
  \ is still waiting for reforms. The inequality it\u2019s clear and the social context\
  \ it\u2019s changing too slowly\u2026\n(\u2026) Visiting Sarajevo you will find\
  \  an open-air-museum, where the west meets the east, despite the darkness of the\
  \ past."
