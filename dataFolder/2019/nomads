Text: "My friend Cora and I went on March of last year to Norway because she was coming\
  \ to visit me in Poland, as I was on an Erasmus year. Suddenly, one day, I found\
  \ an offer to Norway, so I asked to her to go there, she did not think about it\
  \ twice, she said yes in the moment. We were going to travel to Norway the hour\
  \ after she would land in Krakow, Poland, we both knew that it was risky, but we\
  \ had to try it. Her plane came with delay, I thought that both of us would lose\
  \ the trip to Norway. I was waiting for her  in the airport, I did not see her,\
  \ but she was already in the gate of the plane, I did not know anything about the\
  \ situation because she did not have internet on her mobile phone, so she was asking\
  \ to people to borrow her the mobile for a moment and tell me that she already passed\
  \ the check in. In that moment I started to run, people in the airport allowed me\
  \ to go first, as I was taking my luggage, I listened my name from \nthe megaphones\
  \ of the airport, I was running barefoot, as the staff asked me for taking my shoes\
  \ off. Finally, I reached the gate and I found Cora, I hugged her like if there\
  \ was no tomorrow. \n\nThe adventure that we lived in Norway was the best of our\
  \ lives, as we went there without any place booked to sleep, but that will be another\
  \ chapter."
