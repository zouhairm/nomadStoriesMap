Text: "A girl was born and she had a toy as her best friend, with this toy she created\
  \ from her cupboard a game called \u201Cthe flying fish\u201D. In this decorated\
  \ cupboard, she received her friends where they imagined together being in a voyage.\
  \ She was narrating stories to her guests. That was so real and that girl was me.\n\
  \ The time I left my hometown after twenty-five year spent totally there where the\
  \ possibility to travel was almost null, I felt that the air in my lungs was turning\
  \ them into balloons that left me up higher in the sky. \nI have been dreaming of\
  \ the day when I could finally leave from that jail where planes carry no passengers\
  \ and the sea is a field of mines. I was craving to capture a glimpse of light from\
  \ the outer world. That became true when I travelled from Gaza to France seven months\
  \ ago.\nI did not see Eiffel tower or the old French streets at first. Nothing stereotypical\
  \ of France first haunted me; it was simply the movement of life I always prayed\
  \ to touch. I have spent my first hours mediating that huge number of people coming\
  \ from everywhere. They all look different. Everyone was heading with determined\
  \ eyes toward his own destination. The sound of dragging baggage over the roads\
  \ made me thinking of gifts they carry inside and people they must be imagining\
  \ seeing again now. I was alone, trying to understand that immense shift in few\
  \ hours from my small sad city into this entire universe totally unknown to me.\
  \ The coffee shops by the streets, the flow of sun rays through the glassy windows.\
  \ The smiling children with laughters so different from what I am fond of. Suddenly\
  \ the world took off its mask and let me see the old stony buildings of the stations\
  \ and listen the bells of churches that I never heard before. While I was in the\
  \ train, I saw more and more passengers whose gaze reveals no gratitude to the blessing\
  \ of being alive in such a vast world. The alarming when doors were to close reminded\
  \ me of faces waiting the return of beloved smiles. later, I could have been able\
  \ finally to see the houses I used to see in cartoon films with the red roofs and\
  \ trees surrounding them. They were real and I can see them, the windows had those\
  \ white curtains and on the edges there were blossoming plants like my heart at\
  \ that moment.\n I wanted to understand the shape of life here and to talk with\
  \ others whom I saw descending from the train. I remembered that in my city we had\
  \ only cars, in one hour we could go from the beginning until the end of my city,\
  \ one hour equals my entire life. Here in France, two hours passed and I am still\
  \ on my way, trains and faces, doors open and then close. I felt so small and remembered\
  \ how I was searching for a wide place to run. I saw that many places are just places\
  \ to be free in, to jump, to run, to laugh and to live. On my way to my residence\
  \ I saw planes taking off and that was the first time I experienced the irresistible\
  \ desire to portray travel in its simplest meaning;  flying and simply flying.\n\
  \ \nI smiled because I remembered my flying fish as a kid, now I am inside it but\
  \ I am so tired to narrate stories. I looked through the train's window and decided\
  \ to be again a narrator ,one day I will be. \nMusic were everywhere in France,\
  \ so was freedom.\nI cried. The trees were just too high like my dreams back then.\
  \ I missed this world so much . I am deeply thankful for this return."
