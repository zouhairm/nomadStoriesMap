Text: "I had just completed my first year and my break had just started. It had been\
  \ a hectic year of coping up with school. I just needed some time off from books\
  \ and travel. I was staring at my dad\u2019s message which had taken all my excitement\
  \ from hundred to zero. His last message was, \u2018Sorry Ali, we can\u2019t let\
  \ you travel to Ghana for now\u2019. They had just moved to Ghana from Zambia for\
  \ work. I was looking forward to spending time with my family for the Christmas\
  \ break. \nI just had to come up with an alternative plan to make my holidays in\
  \ lieu   of staying on campus. Just for a week! \u2018Malaysia has plenty to offer\u2019\
  , I said thoughtfully. I quickly dashed into my room to grab my laptop to browse\
  \ through for places to visit. Langkawi had been a thing lately and most guys from\
  \ my school traveled there to enjoy the duty-free products, cheap alcohol in particular.\
  \ I wanted to do something a little different. Something more adventurous, a little\
  \ bit risky and memorable. BANGKOK came to mind. I remembered I had a childhood\
  \ friend who moved there. We chatted earlier in the year, a few weeks before I went\
  \ to Malaysia. I remembered his offer for me to visit him someday. I was looking\
  \ to know more about Asia, so I decided to take up his offer. \nI once heard stories\
  \ of local villagers in Thailand who ate black people. My dad even showed me images\
  \ and warned me to be careful with my whereabouts. I used to get chills thinking\
  \ about such. \u2018Do I really need amiable companions to travel with?\u2019 I\
  \ thought to myself. I have learnt that in life you have to take risks to truly\
  \ enjoy. I made up my mind about my destination and contacted my friend to let him\
  \ know that I would be visiting Bangkok and asked if he would be available. Lucky\
  \ enough, he was able to take a short break from work and was excited to meet me.\
  \ \u2018A leap into the unknown huh?\u2019 I chuckled as I confirmed my booking\
  \ from AirAsia, the low budget air line with the most affordable rates in Asia.\n\
  \u201CI have boarded the plane John, see you soon\u201D I told him on the phone\
  \ since he had arranged to pick me up from the airport. The trip was shorter than\
  \ I thought. In a few minutes we landed in Bangkok. To my surprise, everything changed\
  \ when I stepped out. I did not get a memo that in Thailand, there is no English\
  \ whatsoever. All the signposts were written in Thai. I was like a lost puppy standing\
  \ in the middle of the hallway, confused and thinking how I was going to make it\
  \ outside. \u2018You want out? Follow arrow!\u2019 said an old Thai lady with a\
  \ small stature. She was my lifer saver. I put on a huge smile on my face, bowed\
  \ down and hesitantly said, \u2018khxbkhun \u2019. It was the only word I had learnt\
  \ that morning.\nI managed to make my way through the immigration which was the\
  \ most difficult thing for most Africans due to the high rate of drug trafficking.\
  \ My friend was waiting by the exit. We reconnected and jumped into his small Toyota\
  \ car. He was like, \u2018We are off to the nearby coast before I take you into\
  \ the city\u2019. This was the perfect trip I have been craving for. We traveled\
  \ across the country side until we arrived on a small tourist town by the beach\
  \ side called Hua Hin. There was a beautiful scenery. Boats were parked like sardines\
  \ and the place was crowded by Europeans. A cool breeze from the ocean slapped my\
  \ cheeks as I took a deep sigh of relief. \u2018What do you think?\u2019 asked John.\
  \ \u2018Oh well, for a second I thought you were going to sell my body parts to\
  \ some remote village\u2019. We both laughed and I continued to look at the view\
  \ outside only a bird\u2019s eye would see perfectly from above."
