Text: "Raj whispered from the dark for me to breathe, to relax, to be open. Alone,\
  \ he assured his presence as a brother and asked that the truths to arise from the\
  \ smoke be a secret kept by a sister. \n\t\n\u201CI will lose my power if you share.\
  \ You promise?\u201D Raj said.\n\t\nHis dark brown eyes were the first to have genuinely\
  \ met mine since coming to India.  Other men had glanced at me in conversation with\
  \ my husband or stared mesmerized at my existence. Raj pushed back his hair, pulling\
  \ at the shadows of his face to emerge in the prominent light. It had been ten minutes\
  \ since our first hello, and his strangeness faded as I shook his hand.\n\n\u201C\
  I promise,\u201D I said plagued by the accusation of giving American promises: words\
  \ of hollow wasted breath. I would keep this promise. I closed my eyes.\n\t\nHe\
  \ began to pray to Shiva.\n\t\nI wanted to believe Raj could read my palm because\
  \ the day had curiously led to this room, to this house where our tuk-tuk driver\
  \ Sunny lived, now where his cousin grabbed softly at my right hand. I wanted to\
  \ witness the romantic and exotic beliefs pumping through the veins of the people.\n\
  \t\n\u201CAnything is possible in India\u201D Sunny had said as we set out for a\
  \ morning tour of Jaipur.\n\nIn Sunny\u2019s Indian Ferrari, we bumbled through\
  \ the ancient pink city teasing traffic from all directions. Like Russian stacking\
  \ dolls, each layer of the city held an unusual treasure: a flower market run by\
  \ men with tender hands; a Hindi woman tossing dried corn to a hoard of monkeys,\
  \ the jam of pedestrian traffic around a tired cow; the early morning snake charmer.\
  \ Sunny peeled away Jaipur\u2019s tourist exterior until we arrived at the smallest\
  \ of the stacking dolls\u2014his house. \n\t\n\u201CMy door is always open my friend,\
  \ you know why?\u201D Sunny said, \u201CBecause I have no door.\u201D\n\t\nA truth\
  \ we discovered when we accepted an invitation for dinner. The house was a soft\
  \ pink color matching the city and the cement barrier outside his front step. The\
  \ lightbulb from the kitchen cast sharp shadows on the two women crouched in the\
  \ kitchen, beautifully dressed with covered faces. Adorned in a pink sari was Sunny\u2019\
  s wife. As she shifted to nod hello, her jewelry jingled filling the silence in\
  \ the small house. We moved between the women to take the tour given in one breath:\
  \ bedroom, family room, kitchen. We removed our shoes and sat in the family room,\
  \ big enough for four adults to sit knee to knee in a circle. \n\t\n\u201CWe don\u2019\
  t have air conditioning,\u201D Sunny said. \n\t\n\u201CNo, no, we\u2019re fine.\
  \ Thank you for having us over to your house,\u201D I said. \n\t\nAir conditioning\
  \ was the least of their material absences, but Sunny was humble for a man whose\
  \ house had no door, was missing a roof, and held seven hungry mouths. His belly\
  \ was round, and his eyes were soft like a man who befriended sleep. \n\t\nWe sat\
  \ with Sunny and his two children playing UNO in the second-hand light until Raj\
  \ joined the circle dismissing the children, abandoning the cards. The air became\
  \ serious, and Raj began talking like a man hungry for our ears. He spoke wildly\
  \ with his hands directing our understanding of India. \n\t\n\u201CI pray to a statue.\
  \ I have rituals, not because I can see God. I pray, and I know Shiva is there.\u201D\
  \ Raj stopped to blow in my direction. \u201CI can feel it like a fan.\u201D\n\t\
  \nHis presence was consuming. His words silenced Sunny\u2014a follower of Raj\u2019\
  s Guruism\u2014and I upheaved a yes to the ritual despite my Western skepticism.\
  \ \n\t\n\u201CYou promise?\u201D Raj repeated before he began. \n\t\n\u201CYes,\u201D\
  \ I reassured. \n\t\nThe truths unearthed from my palm rolled over Raj\u2019s lips,\
  \ and the promise hardened. The majesty of the moment swelled beyond the walls and\
  \ darkness of the room, pouring into the kitchen and past the women\u2019s feet,\
  \ swallowing the dirt roads and trash, the wild dogs and billions of strange faces.\
  \ I exhaled, inhaling Shiva\u2019s words as the room with no windows grew and I\
  \ plunged into the magic of a poor man speaking through God."
