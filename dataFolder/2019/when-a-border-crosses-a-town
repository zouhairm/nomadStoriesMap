Text: "The bus taking us North and away from the crowded streets of Bangkok smells\
  \ of sugary sweets and tiger balm. I do not know how long this bus ride is going\
  \ to be or what\u2019s waiting for me on the other side. The sun is slowly setting\
  \ as we pass towns that gradually become smaller and smaller, weave our way through\
  \ rocky mountains at the highest of speeds on the most narrow roads. If I wasn\u2019\
  t slightly scared for my life I might have enjoyed this roller coaster ride given\
  \ to us free of cost.The landscape becomes greener and just like outside, the inside\
  \ of the bus gradually becomes more quiet and calm. \n\nThe quite gets interrupted\
  \ only when the bus is stoped for passport control and uniformed men quickly rush\
  \ through the rows checking everyone\u2019s documents at times taking someone off\
  \ the bus. I wonder what happens to them after. I wonder why my passport is never\
  \ checked. While I left my border check point in Bangkok at the gate, others carry\
  \ the border with them at all times.\n\nAfter several more passport stops we arrive\
  \ at the destination. Mae Sot is a small town in the very North of Thailand right\
  \ on the border of Myanmar. It is a border town and as with most border towns, you\u2019\
  ll find many different kinds of people. Some are just passing through, others arrive\
  \ for a short time only to head back home once their time is up, and still others\
  \ come to live here, are born here, build a life and create a sense of constant\
  \ in a space that is so changing, a never ending in-between. \n\nThe bungalow that\
  \ will now be my home is small and cozy. It is rainy season so the wood has swollen\
  \ and its heaviness is soothing. My clothes, my hair, my bags, everything smells\
  \ like rain. Even after a long, albeit cold, shower, I am certain I can still taste\
  \ rain on my tongue. There is a poster of a man on one of the walls who\u2019s identity\
  \ I\u2019ve yet to discover. Despite the dogs howling the entire night, the mosquitos\
  \ relentlessly trying to get through my net and the geckos jumping around the ceiling\
  \ I sleep soundly and deeply, dreaming of the unknown that will become less so in\
  \ the morning.\n\nWhen I meet my landlady the next day and we have some sweet Burmese\
  \ tea together she immediately asks \u2018for how long will you stay?\u2019 Because\
  \ in Mae Sot leaving is not an unexpected event, it is the norm. People have expiration\
  \ dates. While the town is mostly used as a passage onto somewhere else, there is\
  \ a quite large foreigner community due to the strong NGO presence. As with most\
  \ civil wars and regime changes, people are forced to leave their homes and cross\
  \ borders in hopes for a better life. When these movements occur, it is border towns\
  \ such as as Mae Sot that are the primary points of contestation. \n\nThe physical\
  \ border between Thailand and Myanmar is a bridge. Once you have passed the passport\
  \ control of either side you get on the bridge and walk for about ten minutes until\
  \ you reach the passport control of the other side. I find myself walking on this\
  \ bridge a couple of weeks later once again excited to see what\u2019s waiting for\
  \ me on the other side. But unlike the bus ride from Bangkok, nothing seems to change\
  \ during the walk. The water below remains the same color and the air still heavy\
  \ with the smell of rain. Below me, there are also people crossing this same border\
  \ but they are in boats and there is no passport control. A different mode of travel,\
  \ same destination. \n\nI look down to see the boats but am rushed forward by another\
  \ woman. It is true that each place in the world has its own character but there\
  \ is something about border towns that seems to me more resilient. The insistence\
  \ of existence in the midst of constant crossing and passing through, the development\
  \ of a community that remains even if everyone does not. That is Mae Sot."
