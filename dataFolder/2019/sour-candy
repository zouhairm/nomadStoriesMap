Text: "\u201CJaldi madam, this way!\u201D\nI am blindly following the light coming\
  \ from Bahadur\u2019s flashlight. The sound of the twigs snapping below my hurried\
  \ feet, the eerie silence of the tea garden, the intermittent bolts of lightning\
  \ and the shrieking Nor\u2019westers howling through the plantation ,are only announcing\
  \ what we already know - Darjeeling is at war.\n\nAll roads have been cordoned off.\
  \ An unannounced quarantine was being maintained. Was it by the Government? Or the\
  \ Gorkhas? We don\u2019t know. We only know, no one will be allowed to exit or enter\
  \ Darjeeling, till either side wins.\n\nI had been holidaying in a charming little\
  \ tea estate, for the past week. Reading in quaint cafes lined with rows of rhododendron\
  \ & orchids and strolling along the Chowrasta early in the  morning, to look at\
  \ the snow capped peaks of the mighty Kanchenjunga, at 28000 ft, shining brightly\
  \ like liquid gold . I had had copious cups of Darjeeling tea , interrupted only\
  \ by lazy steam-engine toy train rides ,up the hill.This, coupled with my hostess-Mrs.Pradhan\u2019\
  s food, was, utter bliss.\n\nWe had just finished lunch that day, when Bahadur,\
  \ the security guard had come running, to inform us that a riot had broken out near\
  \ the Chowrasta.The GPL party, had threatened \"a fight-to-the-finish\" for Gorkhaland.\
  \ Our government had retaliated with gas bombs and bullets.\nTourists especially,\
  \ were not to leave their rooms till further news. None of this was new-all the\
  \ winding roads, cobblestoned walkways, tiny streams and wildflowers of Darjeeling\
  \ had been groaning under the weight of being a neglected minority, for years. They\
  \ had been asking for Gorkhaland, since early 1900s. This violence in the asking,\
  \ however, was quite new and therefore, addictive to many. \n\nAs the sky had turned\
  \ an angry, fiery orange, we sat inside , hearing of attacks on several tourists\
  \ and shops. Vehicles being smashed, hotels being set on fire.Death and destruction\
  \ loomed in the air like an unwelcome guest. For the first time, the jagged ends\
  \ and crevices of the mountains seemed to have come alive. \n\nAt the end of the\
  \ fourth day of a captivity- as dark clouds loomed over the July sky,it was Mr.Pradhan,\
  \ who had arranged for one seat for me, on the vehicle that would be allowed to\
  \ leave Darjeeling. Only one truck would be going down to Siliguri town, to get\
  \ supplies, at midnight.\nOnly I knew exactly how lucky I was, for this opportunity.\n\
  \n\u201CGet in Madam. Quickly!\u201D, Bahadur ushers.\nInside the truck,we are stuffed\
  \ like a can of worms. About 25 of us, in a 4x4 ft space. Sweat, worry and tears\
  \ have mixed up to emanate a single smell- the smell of fear.\n\nWith me are Nepali\
  \ tea pickers, going to Siliguri, to earn a living. While they have always dreamt\
  \ of a free Gorkhaland, the paralysis of Darjeeling is hardly letting them live\
  \ hand to mouth. While they don\u2019t shun me, I know their anger is directed towards\
  \ a predominantly Bengali Government. My race and ethnicity, by default, makes me\
  \ the enemy.The woman sitting opposite me takes out locally made, sour candy from\
  \ the bag she is carrying, and hands it out to everyone. Everyone, but me. \n\n\
  As the truck rumbles through Pankhabari road ,only a few lights can be seen in the\
  \ town below. The forest around seems thicker, the roads narrower and the headlights\
  \ dimmer, in the mist. The road curves sinisterly and we all sit in silence , hoping\
  \ our vehicle never gets stopped.\n\nBut it does.\n\nAt Bengdubi, a set of mobsters\
  \ have put up a barricade with their bikes. As they look inside, I stand out vividly.\
  \ Is it my face, my eyes...I cannot tell. But they do know, I\u2019m not Nepali.\
  \ I am soon singled out and asked to step out of the vehicle.\nDespite myself, I\
  \ shudder in fear. \n\nBefore I can say anything, I hear the lady beside me speak\
  \ up, \u201CTyo humro saath cha.\u201D\nShe\u2019s with us. Let her go.\n\nAs we\
  \ leave this check-post of hate, I realize I have been crying. I look at her and\
  \ say thank you in Bengali.\n\nShe only smiles and extends her palm towards me.\n\
  In it, are two pieces of sour candy.\n\n\u201CTitaura?\u201D, she asks."
