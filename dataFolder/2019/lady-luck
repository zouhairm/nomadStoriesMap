Text: "As I tentatively looked around Madrid airport, a curious influx of emotions\
  \ engulfed me. I\u2019d spent days, weeks, months preparing for this moment. I couldn\u2019\
  t quite believe that the \u2018pipe dream\u2019 had become a reality. It was really\
  \ happening, right here, right now. After years of mundanity, I\u2019d finally taken\
  \ the plunge, packed my life into two bags, and moved to the Spanish capital. \n\
  \nOn my second day in Madrid, I met a beautiful girl from Honiara, the Solomon Islands.\
  \ We were sitting in the shadiest spot we could find in Retiro park, in a bid to\
  \ temporarily escape the all-consuming heatwave the country was experiencing. Mid\
  \ conversation, I felt something hit my arm. I looked down to discover the unmistakable\
  \ liquidy substance of bird business, which had somehow filtered through the tree\
  \ tops to land directly on my skin. Despite my initial revulsion, I heard my grandmother\u2019\
  s voice in my head: \u2018It\u2019s supposed to be a sign of luck, darling!\u2019\
  \ I hoped she was right, and that my life was about to take a lucky turn.\n\nI felt\
  \ far from lucky in the months that ensued. I recall staring blankly at a poor cashier\
  \ in the local supermercado, after she simply asked me, \u2018do you want a bag\
  \ with that?\u2019 I was practically a mute on Uber journeys, and could just about\
  \ exchange basic social niceties with my apartment\u2019s superintendant. \u2018\
  Mas despacio, por favor\u2019 (speak slowly, please) quickly became my favourite\
  \ phrase, and I found myself feeling increasingly frustrated by my complete inability\
  \ to express myself.\n\nHowever, after a long day consisting of communication barriers,\
  \ lesson planning and teaching, I would return home to Flat 4A. I would be immediately\
  \ welcomed back, as if I hadn\u2019t left in the first place. All the worries of\
  \ the day would dissipate as I sat on the sofa with my Australian, Brazilian and\
  \ American amigas, where we laughed, joked and constructed great plans for our favourite\
  \ time of the week: the weekend (naturally). \n\nTogether, or with some of the other\
  \ fantastic people we\u2019d met during our teacher training course over the summer,\
  \ we would seek to explore the beautiful country which we now inhabited. We ventured\
  \ to Salamanca, which consisted of stomach shots, creasing, frog finding and general\
  \ international mayhem. We took the Cercan\xEDa to El Escori\xE1l to explore the\
  \ breath-taking architectural monument of the Spanish Renaissance. We even dragged\
  \ ourselves out of bed at 6am to travel down to the southern Andalusian town of\
  \ Granada, where we ate our body weight in tapas, visited the stunning Alhambra,\
  \ undertook an informative city tour and hiked up numerous cobbled streets.\n\n\
  Trudging up the comically small incline, I couldn\u2019t help but compare it to\
  \ my radical move to Spain. I was tragically ill-prepared for both (my lack of Spanish\
  \ lessons made it so, as did my last physical exercise taking place in 2001), and\
  \ kept asking myself: \u2018why am I doing this?\u2019 \n\nBut rather than retreating\
  \ to where I started, I persevered to the top. The spectacular views of an ancient\
  \ kingdom at sunrise reminded me why. It made it all worth it. A mumbled, \u2018\
  no, I don\u2019t need a bag\u2019 had evolved into a full conversation with a stranger\
  \ on the bus. I was only mildly nauseated when I needed to ask someone where the\
  \ popcorn is (an excellent cure for nausea, coincidentally), and after publicly\
  \ declaring that I was \u2018embarazada\u2019, now knew that this does not, in fact,\
  \ translate to \u2018I feel embarrassed\u2019 (instead, I had accidentally announced\
  \ to my friends that I was pregnant). \n\nWas it that my luck was finally looking\
  \ up, as Gran predicted? I\u2019m not sure about that. I think I\u2019d thrown luck\
  \ out the window and just gotten on with it, one step at a time."
