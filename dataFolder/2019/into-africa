Text: "Into Africa\nOn the rooftop garden terrace, the succulents grew colorful and\
  \ abundant like choral. \nSome of them were planted in pots made of halfway cut\
  \ car tires that made me think of a big African smile.\nI had missed the first light\
  \ of my first African morning, light that makes you feel like anything is possible,\
  \ according to Hemingway.\nNow the sun was already high up in the sky and what I\
  \ mostly felt was its heat.\n\nAbove the rusty, corrugated iron roofs a large grey\
  \ bird was circling, right before it made a dive into the city\u2019s smoggy depth,\
  \ I recognized it to be a Dutch heron, which was, maybe just like me, on a well-needed\
  \ escape from the dark and cold Dutch winter.\nI was going to be picked up by Charles,\
  \ or Charley for his friends, which name reminded me of John Steinbeck\u2019s hairy\
  \ travel partner.\nWhen we stepped into the car I asked him half-jokingly if he\
  \ considered me to be his friend. \u2018No\u2019, he said smilingly, \u2018I consider\
  \ you as my brother.\u2019\nAs I was in Nairobi for only one day, Charles would\
  \ take me to see the highlights.\n\u2018I will take you to the Karen Blixen museum\
  \ and the giraffe centre and afterwards I will bring you back to the hotel. It\u2019\
  s too late now to see the elephants at the orphanage as they\u2019re fed in the\
  \ morning. For that you had to wake up at dawn.\u2019\nCharles or Charley was one\
  \ of the first native Africans I met and who I felt an instant connection with.\n\
  I wondered though, how that would feel at the end of the day when I wouldn\u2019\
  t give him a big tip.\nWould he still call me his brother? Or would I suddenly become\
  \ his enemy?\n\nOne of the hotel employees, dressed in a blue suit with big yellow\
  \ boots underneath it throws a bucket of ice cold water on the terrace floor that\
  \ almost turns into steam before it hits the hot floor.\nWhen he turns on his music,\
  \ I hear a funny combination of dance and rap with, as a transference between the\
  \ songs, a nervous siren. It was the same siren you heard between the songs of the\
  \ city. \u2018Bongo flava!\u2019 the hotel employee yells smilingly from the other\
  \ side of the terrace, when he notices my foot stamping in the smoking water.\n\n\
  My fruit is served in a white bowl, the red and green of the watermelon, the bright\
  \ yellowness of pineapple, it\u2019s like the sun\u2019s still in it.\nThe dark\
  \ orange colour of the sweet ripe mango that has, just as banana, its distinctively\
  \ own, sweet, but mealy, melancholy taste that somehow makes me long for my girlfriend,\
  \ whom I would see again soon after two weeks.\n\nShe was traveling to see her sponsor\
  \ child.\nWho she sends money to, to have access to clean drinking water and a uniform\
  \ to go to school with.\nMy girlfriend also brought a big suitcase full of Dutch\
  \ snacks and clothes, but the suitcase got lost during the transfer in Cairo. \n\
  Fortunately, she received a picture that it arrived safely at the post office in\
  \ Iringa a few days later.\n\nIt is almost dark when Charles brings me back to the\
  \ hotel.\nAs I walk to the rooftop terrace, the image of an American woman comes\
  \ back to mind who was French-kissing one of the giraffes, which we were able to\
  \ feed and pet from a balcony in the trees.\nNext to a beer I give Charley a tip\
  \ which makes him call me his brother and his friend. \u2018The beer is called \u2018\
  Safari\u2019, which means journey in Swahili.\u2019 Charles said.\n\u2018Wow! And\
  \ we\u2019re just in time to see the sun go down Charles.\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019\
  \ he said.\nWhich made me feel anything would be possible."
