Text: "\u201CWhat made you leave?\u201D, I ask her while her little daughter hides\
  \ behind her and looks at me with curious eyes. \u201CIt\u2019s not safe back there!\u201D\
  . Her reply is short and abrupt. I wonder if I shouldn\u2019t have asked that, but\
  \ she smiles and continues, \u201CWe want to live in a safe place, for ourselves\
  \ and our kids\u201D. She probably has been confronted with the same question many\
  \ times. I smile back and make funny faces at her daughter who starts laughing and\
  \ opening up to me. She starts talking in a language I don\u2019t understand. Her\
  \ mother tells me its Dari, one of the two widely spoken languages in Afghanistan.\
  \ The old Mochi, shoe mender, continues with stitching the shoes at his spot on\
  \ the shaded pavement. I wait for my turn as jovial faces, mostly Afghans, pass\
  \ us. I am quite surprised and amused. I am not in Afghanistan but in a densely\
  \ populated neighbourhood called Khidki in Malviya Nagar, a locality in South Delhi.\
  \ Khidki means window and the name takes after an old mosque here. I get my shoe\
  \ mended and turn to leave. The little girl catches hold of one of my legs and asks\
  \ me not to go. She wants to play; her mother tells me. They are among the thousands\
  \ of Afghan refugees that have fled their homeland in search of a safe haven. I\
  \ play along with her some more and then leave.\n\nMalviya Nagar was originally\
  \ populated by refugees who fled from Pakistan during the Partition of India in\
  \ the 1950s. Today refugees from several nationalities live in the densely packed\
  \ Khidki Extension. I walk around and the faces that greet me are from diverse ethnic\
  \ and cultural backgrounds. Whites, blacks, coloureds - you see them all. The narrow\
  \ crammed streets are lined with bustling shops of food, groceries, and electronics,\
  \ mostly owned by these refugees. Vegetable and fruit vendors move their carts around.\
  \ The strong aroma of food reaches me. I look around and find that eateries here\
  \ specialise in cuisines as diverse as the multicultural demographics of the locality.\
  \ There are the Indian lassi, samosas, jalebis, Afghani tandoor, biryani along with\
  \ a variety of breads and Mughlai cuisines. I pass excited children returning from\
  \ school involved in their chatter and carefree life, oblivious to the brutal violence\
  \ back home. African women in Burqa linger in the shops.\n\nI talk to a few shopkeepers.\
  \ They appear friendly and exude warmth. Many of them fled decades of war and instability\
  \ in their home countries to find better living conditions. It is a struggle trying\
  \ to leave everything behind and adjust in a city that is not their own. I look\
  \ at their faces and wonder about the untold stories they hide behind their beaming\
  \ faces and warm laughter \u2013  of separation, of loss, grief, anger, suffering,\
  \ and uncertainties. But maybe also of hope and opportunities and new beginnings.\
  \ Some have lost their everything to the war. Some have lost loved ones. All that\
  \ remains are memories of their beloved homelands that linger and maybe fade in\
  \ their minds. And here you see them laughing and enjoying as they go about their\
  \ daily lives without the shadow of guns, death and destruction.\n\nKhidki is may\
  \ be a window to the world. A world torn apart from war, conflict, and struggles\
  \ underneath but also of hope and resilience, and of finding opportunities and of\
  \ finding a home away from home.\n\nIn the evening I take a stroll in a neighbourhood\
  \ park with my friend whom I am visiting here. We watch teenagers playing a game\
  \ of football. There are Afghans, Somalis and Indians playing together while the\
  \ ball moves around to calls in fluent Hindi. One of them invites us to play. Unsure\
  \ of our fitness we reluctantly join. In the joyous echoes of the game there are\
  \ no boundaries or threats of war or conflicts. I am exhausted physically but somehow\
  \ I feel at peace inside."
