Text: "We were welcomed by dark clouds sweeping across the sky. The moist-laden winds\
  \ were gushing in. The reverberating thunder seemed to announce our arrival. Our\
  \ view was deluged by the heavy rain. My internal storm did not succumb to the external\
  \ storm. My mind was flooded with self-destructive thoughts; \u201CI do not want\
  \ to be alive\u201D is one of the thoughts that kept reeling in my mind. The sight\
  \ of the lightning bolts piercing through the dark clouds struck a feeling that\
  \ I had arrived at another dystopia.\n\nI did not understand why my sister forced\
  \ me to join her on this trip to Nepal. We had an eighty-four kilometre walk, from\
  \ BesiSahar to Manang, awaiting us. \n\nWe started with a thirteen kilometre walk\
  \ on the first day. The air was hot and humid. This was far from my expectations\
  \ of a day in Nepal. We arrived to the sound of a goat bleating in agony at the\
  \ guesthouse. The goat was being slaughtered. My eyes were overwhelmed with tears\
  \ when I saw the goats head separated from its body. We slept on a hard-rock bed,\
  \ which was common in Nepal. We had an ice-cold shower. There were only squat toilets\
  \ available. These elements did not cease encourage my lack of enthusiasm. \n\n\
  On the second day we encountered numerous landslides. I believed that it was a sign\
  \ that we should end our trip. My sister\u2019s excitement was relentless. We encountered\
  \ a Nepali man who helped us make our way through the landslides. We had to manoeuvre\
  \ around large boulders that had fallen. We had to cross paths with water rioting\
  \ beneath us.  I had big clunky boots soaked with water, a giant backpack and a\
  \ mind filled with rage. It all felt extremely cumbersome. \n\nOn the third day\
  \ we passed a funeral of a lady who had died the day before due to a landslide.\
  \ It was a sad sight. It put my life into perspective. \u201CLife is finite. So,\
  \ I should live with every breath I have.\u201D This is the thought that opened\
  \ my eyes to the beauty that surrounded me. To the Nepali people, landslides could\
  \ devastate, destroy and take lives. I found my life at the sight a tragedy.  \n\
  \nSerenity dawned on me the next morning. The air was clear and crisp exposing miles\
  \ of the delicate beauty of the mountain range. During our walk, forests turned\
  \ into fields of flowers. My nostrils were filled with the scent of the Magnolia\
  \ Champaca. I was consumed with joy. I saw red plants called, Sea Buckthorn Berries.\
  \ They are supposed to be the cure for everything. Ironically, when I drank the\
  \ juice I felt like my thirst for life had been quenched.  We had a mouth-watering\
  \ Dal Baht for dinner: a combination of rice, curry, lentils and miscellaneous vegetables.\
  \ The taste of it made me feel like my spirit was being replenished. \n\nWe were\
  \ confronted by a construction site on the fifth day. Guesthouses were being built.\
  \ To my surprise, there were western toilets. It felt like a symbol of a new beginning,\
  \ not only for this part of Nepal but for me too. \n\nThe sun\u2019s rays blared\
  \ down on us during our seventeen kilometre walk on the sixth day. It felt like\
  \ the intensity of the sunlight was at its peak to foster the synthesis my elation.\
  \ We climbed up and down dusty hills. We saw cascading water falling down rocks.\
  \ The sound of the waterfalls was very refreshing, considering the heat that we\
  \ were experiencing. \nThe sky was painted with the animated colours of the sunset\
  \ in the late afternoon. The horizon was at eye level, making it seem like I existed\
  \ half above and half below. It felt like I was emerging with the mountains through\
  \ the atmosphere. The night sky was filled with infinite eyes, glistening with gratitude.\n\
  \n\u201CWhat did you learn from this trip?\u201D my sister asked as we reached our\
  \ destination on the seventh day. \u201CI learnt that I am grateful for the life\
  \ I have and the life around me.\u201D I finally understood why my sister forced\
  \ me to join her on this trip. I had arrived at my utopia."
