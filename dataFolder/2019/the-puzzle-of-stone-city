Text: "Sacred places are also imaginative experiences, by virtue of sensations on\
  \ the verge of magical realism. Put on your feet on the capital of Inca Empire,\
  \ 11,1519 feets above the sea level, demands a softer breath that people of Cusco,\
  \ without cerimony, teach you: to chew coca\u2019s leaf. The bitter taste on the\
  \ palate contrasts with the flavours of Andean cuisine, from the international ceviche\
  \ to cuy (cooked guinea pig). Cusco, \u201Cthe belly button of the world\u201D on\
  \ quechua language, get along with more than 700 dialects from tribes who resist\
  \ since the spanish colonialism to the american imperialism. The city is full of\
  \ symbols, alternating between ruins, Inca temples and churches, monasteries and\
  \ palaces from cristianism. On June 24 is celebrated the festival of Sun God (Inti\
  \ Raymi) and, in a playful way, we return to the XII century to celebrate the arrival\
  \ of a new year. It is a sensorial show, revived through the dramaturgy of old rituals.\
  \ Go back in time and reverence its origins is part of the peruan soul, it is not\
  \ only a turistic attraction, it is the renaissance of values, beliefs and traditions.\
  \ Between a sip of pisco sour, a destilled of grape, with lemon juice, egg white,\
  \ syrup of sugar and pepper, you get thrilled, either with the children\u2019s amuse\
  \ with a painted face or with the warrior\u2019s conviction for the sacrifice of\
  \ a good harvest. Absolutely everything touches some point in your memories, history\
  \ and fantasy. At night, the bars are full and the sound comes from the strong blow\
  \ on instruments made of rush and clay \u2013 it is the blues of Andean flutes that,\
  \ once more, undo the time logic. On the way to the hotel, through the dark alleys,\
  \ the cold wind whistles and freezes your body and, only in that way, you realize\
  \ where and in which year you are. On the land where the sun is king, the day dawns\
  \ between the mountains and the red dust. The light illuminates the railroad and\
  \ foothills the Andes on the way to \xC1guas Calientes. It is 3 hours of landscapes\
  \ differing from Cusco\u2019s aridity to the lush of the Amazon Rainforest, passing\
  \ through rivers and mountains covered of snow. On the landing, the emotion of being\
  \ almost there, really close to the hidden city, in which this year celebrates 100\
  \ years of discovery. But, when looking up and seeing nothing, we are surprised\
  \ by mazes in the search of the Archeological Sanctuary of Machu Picchu. Before\
  \ following the trail until the Sun\u2019s Door (Inti Punku), we are seduced by\
  \ the comes and goes on the city streets, they are backpackers, residents, dreamers\
  \ that emanate unusual stories. The place is a rite of passage to the unknown that\
  \ with complicity holds the adventures expectations with the rare beauty of handicrafts,\
  \ recognized by its embroidery and colors, fabric with the meanings of this ancestral\
  \ culture, thriving. The ending is the reunion with Machu Picchu ruins, the historic\
  \ site that when confront the science, confirms the reverence of Inca civilization\
  \ to the astronomy and nature. The visit is silent, and awakes all of your senses.\
  \ You want to touch the stones, perceive the energy once worshiped. The old mountain\
  \ hides lessons we do not always understand, the feeling is that the temples whispers\
  \ individual truths to whom dare surrender to the mystery of the ancient peoples.\
  \ It is not just the thin air which requires adaptation \u2013 you must sit in a\
  \ rock and see. Where is the intersection point? Which is the tie between what you\
  \ see and who you are? The supreme divinity blinds you, makes sweat run down your\
  \ face and in that moment, the nature attaches you with the mountain. After some\
  \ time, I see people looking at me, taking pictures of such a daydream. I walk to\
  \ them and ask: why? Look over there, the Condor is on the same rock. The legend\
  \ has it that he is the connection between heavens and the earth, gods and mortals.\
  \ One of the biggest birds of the world flies out and leaves no trace to avoid extinction."
