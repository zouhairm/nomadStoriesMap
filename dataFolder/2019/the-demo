Text: "I\u2019ve always considered myself an anxious person. Not necessarily in the\
  \ traditional sense, mind you, more in the sense that I once almost shattered both\
  \ my ankles climbing out two-story window to avoid talking my parent\u2019s guests\
  \ in the front room, so what better way to combat this than to move halfway across\
  \ the world and become an English teacher. \n\nOne very emotional mother, as much\
  \ free whiskey as the flight attendants permitted and 22 hours later, I arrived\
  \ at Ho Chi Minh airport. I was greeted by a warm breeze and a naivety I\u2019d\
  \ not felt since I lost my virginity. \n\n*** \n\nI won\u2019t bore you with the\
  \ usual hostel drinking stories or failed attempts at casual romance. Two weeks\
  \ in and I'd my first interview, or demo lesson in an hour, and my nervous sweats\
  \ had made my dorm bed uninhabitable. I had a light breakfast to reduce the risk\
  \ of vomiting. I took deep breaths of smog-I was ready for this. I'd done all my\
  \ research. I\u2019d read the brief. I'd my lesson plans down to a fine art. I hopped\
  \ onto my scooter where I quickly learned that the traffic flow in Vietnam is similar\
  \ to blood-if it stops entirely someone is probably dead. \n\n*** \n\nI found the\
  \ school easily enough. It looked nice. I told my name at the front desk and was\
  \ led down a hallway. They\u2019re only kids, I thought as I entered the classroom\
  \ to face a group of adults. None of them younger than forty. \n\n\"So, these are\
  \ the kids,\u201D I was told. \n\nI waited for a laugh, but she was serious-this\
  \ was my class. Not only was the lesson itself a mock lesson, but the students were\
  \ simulations. The only thing that wasn\u2019t fake was the chance of my heart cutting\
  \ itself out of my chest and hopping out the window. \n\n \"Will I begin?\" I asked\
  \ with frightened eyes. I got no response. They were already in character. I wasn\u2019\
  t sure what to call them. \n\n\u201CHi...kids?\u201D \n\n\u201CHello, Teacher,\u201D\
  \ they replied in unison. \n\n My body had the choice of fight or flight. Fight?\
  \ Surrogates or not, they were still kids. I remembered the briefing-twenty-five-minute\
  \ class. The material should cover animals. Go! \n\n\u201CWho likes animals?\u201D\
  \ My voice squeaked and sounded like it was coming through a keyhole in my throat.\
  \ \n\n\u201CMe! Me!\u201D Said the balding child. \n\nI began to pin the animals\
  \ up on the board and soon discovered that they'd all been assigned specific roles\
  \ to play in order to give authenticity to the classroom-the shy withdrawn kid.\
  \ The inquisitive prodigy and, of course, the bully and they acted in accordance\
  \ to their respective characters. \n\nArmed with a sticky ball and high fives, I\
  \ dived straight in with an ice breaker game which consisted of the students trying\
  \ to hit the animal pictures. I beckoned the first student up He flung the sticky\
  \ ball and hit his target on his first go. I congratulated the grown man for identifying\
  \ a cat. The other was a woman-the bully. She instantly threw it at the ceiling\
  \ and she gave me look as if to say: \u2018what are you gonna do?\u2019 \n\nThis\
  \ look faded as I produced a second sticky ball and told she was going to miss a\
  \ turn. My confidence was watered. We moved onto the main event-a game which involved\
  \ acting like an animal. I began to hop like a kangaroo. \n\n\u201CWhat animal am\
  \ I? Come on, what am I doing?\u201D \n\nThat was a good question-there I was jumping\
  \ around a classroom in Vietnam pretending to be a kangaroo in front of three Vietnamese\
  \ strangers who were pretending to be children and I was loving it. I know what\
  \ my comfort zone looks like and that was not it-you never quite get over anxiety,\
  \ you just adjust to the unnatural and let your skin thicken to the unexpected.\
  \ \n\nAs I watched the kids jump around, I felt a strange feeling of pride. Soon,\
  \ they all joined in. \n\n\"Rabbit!\" \n\n\"Dog!\" \n\n\u201CNo, I\u2019m a Ka...Kang...\u201D\
  \ I hinted. \n\n\u201CKangaroo!\u201D They all shouted. \n\n\"Very good, Teacher,\"\
  \ said the older of the two women who suddenly broke character as she extended her\
  \ hand. \n\nI was hired."
