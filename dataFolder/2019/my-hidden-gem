Text: "The air was chilly with a hint of salt, the street lights were shining a diffuse\
  \ light and you could hear fading laughter at every corner. We were smiling, exchanging\
  \ impressions and climbing stairs on narrow streets while admiring the hills of\
  \ Lisbon. We were all a group of strangers who met on the airplane or in the hostel\
  \ looking for a taste of authentic Lisbon. We got a hint from someone in the group\
  \ and after getting lost a few times there it was. A wooden antique door with no\
  \ sign except a big handle ring. My new friend knocked it twice, the door opened\
  \ and an old blue eyed man who was smoking from a pipe appeared and invited us in.\n\
  \ We stepped into the smallest bar I`ve ever been. It was the size of my apartment\
  \ living room with a few tables and some small cube chairs. What started as an adventure\
  \ quickly became shady since there was still no band and we were told it was going\
  \ to be a concert. Also, the old man seemed to talk with us only in riddles. However,\
  \ there was a strange energy in that place, it felt special, exclusive, people kept\
  \ coming in and the small room quickly got full.  \nWe got a glass of delicious\
  \ vinho verde while the band started playing. It felt like time stopped and a different\
  \ dimension emerged. In that small room we were all one with the music. The violin,\
  \ the drum, the panpipe and the live voice singing old Portuguese songs brought\
  \ us all, strangers in one bubble on that beautiful unforgettable evening. We felt\
  \ the joy of the songs, the sadness, the love and the angst.\nIn that small bar\
  \ I saw real art for the first time. Art that brings you closer, talent that turns\
  \ your insides into mush and real passion that sets you free. For the first time\
  \ I was at a live concert and no one was applauding because the experience felt\
  \ too sacred. We were only rubbing our palms together in order to send a small sound\
  \ of appreciation.\nI believe that is the magic of Lisbon, the city of freedom.\
  \ Freedom in the street art which is everywhere around the city, in the way people\
  \ act and express, in the way all the nature elements manifest. No order but no\
  \ chaos either, perfect balance. It made me realize it`s a place I truly wish to\
  \ come back and that I want to experience Portugal in all its forms."
