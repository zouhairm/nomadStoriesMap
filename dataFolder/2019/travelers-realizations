Text: "I am an example of how travel catapulted me into my path of self-discovery&awareness\
  \ of the world..I can trace back to the earliest days of my memorywhen I recognized\
  \ this innate knowing for something more.I questionedhumanity,education,careers&government.At\
  \ first thought,we may appear to be infinitesimally small&disconnected,but in reality\
  \ we are vast; every move we make somehow affects one another. Humanity has been\
  \ brainwashed by media to create distractions from what is really going on in the\
  \ world;societal injustices which generates a deep rooted hatred towards each other.It\
  \ has bred contempt&created an unjustifiable system turning people into dejected\
  \ money making machines.Pesticide, preservative-ridden food,fluoride&overuse of\
  \ natural resources.We are blindsided by ever-changing trends rather than focusing\
  \ on what is truly important;connecting with citizens of the world sustaining a\
  \ union that flourishes into an evolving peaceful home with our planet.Our collective\
  \ consciousness is muted by TV, pessimistic news stories instilling fear of the\
  \ world to steer clear of other cultures.Why would they encourage positive growth&expansion\
  \ when you can create a veil of ignorance,so there is no questioning of human rights.I\
  \ was raised in a mixed family;the outcast role.I had no idea who I was,what my\
  \ talents were except writing.This is where I was able to find my inner voice&engage\
  \ in thought-provoking topics.I also developed a relationship with the outdoors\
  \ because of the stress it alleviated&stillness that overcame my mind. I pined for\
  \ change, got my TEFL,interviewed,&took off to Beijing with $430.It was the precipice\
  \ of my soul progression.I was tested in many ways from being a teacher & tutor\
  \ of various ages, learning how tomake a living&redefine my life in a foreign country.\
  \ Living abroad gives you an exhilarating sense of strength,a new outlook on life\
  \ for other societies&belief systems;instills commoncourtesy&respect.I have developed\
  \ a deeper sense of empowerment,awareness,&confidence. I\u2019ve volunteered for\
  \ orphanages,NGO\u2019s,organic farm festivals, worked at elementary& liberal arts\
  \ schools, a summer camp&developed lifelong skills I want to continue to share with\
  \ the world.I am constantly dissecting my purpose&drawn to working with youth.I\
  \ want to continue expanding so I can put my best self forward;teaching them how\
  \ to be kind, accountable with positive & sustainable values of the world. Some\
  \ valuable advice I have acquired through life of learning&travel that can be applied\
  \ to lead more soul-fulfilling lives.Accepting change is the most freeing form of\
  \ resilience.You create your life&attract all people that come&go through thoughts\
  \ you send into the universe. Everyone is divinely placed in your life for a learning\
  \ experience.You bring everything into your experience by putting energy into your\
  \ thoughts.This is law of attraction.Allow others to be themselves as they allow\
  \ you to be you. I suggest leading by example&challenge a desire to dig deep within&develop\
  \ a growth mindset.Meditation helps to view life from a different perspective. With\
  \ diligent practice, it pushes through mental chatter&teaches you to differentiate\
  \ inner wisdom from your ego. Get out of your comfort zone,it\u2019s when the magic\
  \ begins. Revamp your diet.You are what you eat, food is nourishment for the soul.Connect\
  \ with nature&recognizebeauty in the natural cycles appreciate the persistence.Don't\
  \ waste time wishing you could change the past,if it weren't for those choices you\
  \ wouldn't be where you are today. Don\u2019t poison your mind with toxic thoughts;realize\
  \ you create sustainable long-term change in your life.There will be challenges,it's\
  \ about what you take from them. Everyone is entitled to their own definition of\
  \ fulfillment;people will naturally disagree.But know,ifyou feel a deeper calling\
  \ for more&feel compelled to travel,don't limit yourself. Overcome your fear of\
  \ rejection&accept yourself so you can love others.Step into your fullest creative\
  \ & expressive power. We are limitless.Experiences shape us&make us who we are.\
  \ Be gentle with yourself &others, reaffirm it everyday.Think it,say it,believe\
  \ it.If you are not seeing the results you wish to have in your life, it is because\
  \ you have talked yourself out of them.Be your own biggest fan.For me,Icouldn't\
  \ dare lead an average life with fixed responsibilities&not makean impact in some\
  \ sort of a way.I chose to do life differently than how most of us are instinctively\
  \ raised to be.I implore you to nourish your soul,trust your intuition, DARE&CARE\
  \ to be different,leave your legacy,no matter how insignificant it may seem.All\
  \ it takes one step in a positive direction to create a domino effect of change."
