Text: "Within minutes of the band kick starting their music, a young man, dressed\
  \ only from the waist down, joined an older man on the large rectangular rug in\
  \ front of the traditional Gnaoua group. The sounds of hand claps from the all-Moroccan\
  \ audience met in time with their spiky rhythms and I felt a surge of excitement.\
  \ I was sitting on the floor of a private house in the coastal town of Essaouira\
  \ and the strangest night of my life was about to unfold.\n \nA young girl of no\
  \ more than fourteen rushed forward from the crowd and started to twist and writhe,\
  \ her entire body shaking with the bewitching music. Next, she was on her knees\
  \ with her head jolting back violently again and again, as if someone was yanking\
  \ her hair. She seemed to be having a strange fit, directed towards the musicians\
  \ themselves. \n \nNext, the owner of the house began to drape large, coloured scarves\
  \ over the heads of the two entranced. She waved a bowl of burning incense under\
  \ their noses. They staggered and shuddered, as if possessed; their pained, grimacing\
  \ faces at times slipping out from under the material. I was shocked but completely\
  \ intrigued.\n \nBefore long, several other women were drawn into this bizarre rectangle,\
  \ having submitted themselves to the apparently irresistible force of the music.\
  \ When the driving rhythm suddenly stopped they collapsed to the floor, looking\
  \ weakened, almost spent. They were helped away to recover by friends or family.\
  \ One of these emotionally drained women wept softly in another\u2019s lap.\n \n\
  I asked my companion Hamid, a local guy, if he had ever been in a trance.\n\u201C\
  I\u2019ve been coming to listen to this kind of music since I was a boy,\u201D he\
  \ said. \u201CBut it has only happened to me once. I was about seventeen, I think.\u201D\
  \n\u201CDid you actually remember anything about it?\u201D I wondered.\n\u201CWell,\
  \ not really. My friends told me about it later. I remember waking up, feeling a\
  \ little tired but fine apart from that.\u201D\n   \nWith the resumption of the\
  \ music, there was even more intensity in the air and the candle-lit room was vibrating\
  \ from the energy of the Gnauoa musicians: themselves, ancestors of slaves. The\
  \ balconies above us were filled with eyes gazing down and almost immediately new\
  \ men and women were sucked into the open area in front of the musicians. Just as\
  \ before, they had begun their song slowly and built gradually to a frenetic crescendo.\n\
  \ \nNow though, a middle-aged woman grabbed a handful of lit candles off the floor\
  \ and ran them up and down the skin of her left arm. Oblivious to any pain, she\
  \ repeated this on her neck, and her eyes bulged. She was making sickening yodeling\
  \ noises and her legs and shoulders shook in a sinister yet sexually provocative\
  \ way. I looked around the room, expecting someone to stop her or hold her down\
  \ but Hamid, next to me was calm-faced.\n \nThe music continued its surge and then\
  \ from somewhere, the same woman produced a kitchen knife and began to slice across\
  \ her arms. Astonishingly, no blood appeared. She was laughing and opened her mouth\
  \ wider, rapidly running the blade deeply into her tongue, back and forth, back\
  \ and forth. I could not believe what I was truly seeing and momentarily wondered\
  \ which century I was in. This scene struck me as somehow timeless, animalistic.\
  \ \n \nMore men were in trances now. Their bodies convulsed in spasms and the knives\
  \ they slashed across their wagging tongues were also failing to draw blood. One\
  \ of them was on his knees arching back. Shirtless, his stomach muscles could be\
  \ seen straining tight. He began to drip hot wax onto his naked chest, his hips\
  \ pumping into the air, as if in the act of sex. Near him, a young woman nearby\
  \ just rocked slowly up and down while a boy stood completely still, only his head\
  \ shaking head rapidly.\n\nThis was the climax of the frenzy. The music had become\
  \ laboured and those in trances moved sluggishly. Hamid said we should go. I put\
  \ my trust in him and we stepped out into the blue-black darkness of the old medina\
  \ once more."
