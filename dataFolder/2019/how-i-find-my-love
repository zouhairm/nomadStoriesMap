Text: "Lawal and I, both living in Nigeria at the time, began chatting after lawal\
  \ commented on one of my Instagram photos of ghana photos. A plan to go on an  photo\
  \ tour together fell through and, after months of not talking, Instagram gave us\
  \ another chance. One message turned into two, two turned into Skype \u2014 and\
  \ over the next few months, we fell in love talking between Nigeria and ghana. We\
  \ were speaking every single day. This wasn\u2019t just a travel fling. \n\nWith\
  \ New Years approaching, we decided to meet in Nigeria. What better way to plan\
  \ a \u201Cfirst date\u201D than to plan a \u201Cshort\u201D (read: three week) ghana\
  \ Trip together. We had never met in person before, but we locked in the bus, trains,\
  \ and Airbnbs for seven states. Everything was booked. There was no turning back.\
  \ My friends called us \u201Coptimistically mad.\u201D Lawal surprised me when I\
  \ landed in Victoria island by coming to the bus park, and with a first hug and\
  \ a kiss we set off on our adventure. We rang in the New Year in Victoria island\
  \ and saw the Christmas Markets in Prague. We ventured to kano, day-tripped to our\
  \ beloved henna, and explored dancing and chess. Lawal had to get ready for her\
  \ final semester of school, so we returned to Ilorin and sneaked away to oyo \u2014\
  \ to explore the city that brought us together. Our first adventure together was\
  \ filled with long walks through the Old Towns, amazing ancient house, slave trade,\
  \ and chats about our future.\n\nOver a year later, we live together in Ghana, and\
  \ we are moving back to Nigeria. We\u2019ll continue to blog about our adventures."
