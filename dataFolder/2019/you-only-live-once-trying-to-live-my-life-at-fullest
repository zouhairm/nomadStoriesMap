Text: "I am an IT Engineer who wants to explore the world. Amidst my busy schedule\
  \ I always try to take out time and go out and connect with nature and the people\
  \ nearby. Though I haven't traveled outside of India, but every time I visit a new\
  \ place in India, I feel like I am a changed person now. I do believe in the fact\
  \ that traveling makes you richer in experiences. I do write about the places and\
  \ the trips I have been to. One of my trip I would like to highlight here is my\
  \ trip to Velas - Turtle festival. So, this place was far away from city life with\
  \ no internet connectivity. We went there to see turtle hatching. It was one of\
  \ the most exciting trips of my life. Seeing those tiny turtles, hatching and going\
  \ back to where they belong i.e. SEA was one hell of a experience. Learning and\
  \ experiencing their life cycle was a different mark. It was a village so there\
  \ were no hotels and all as well. We gotta stay at the homes of the natives and\
  \ experience their life style. We were treated like we are the house guests and\
  \ we were asked what we would like to eat and where would we like to stay etc. So,\
  \ it was an overall different trip we got to experience by getting away from our\
  \ regular life style. \nI love to explore such places and do not want to bound myself\
  \ within India. I also believe traveling, capturing moments, and writing about it\
  \ will give you different perspective of life. You get to know so much that each\
  \ time you visit a place, you relive once again. I have been to many states in India\
  \ and experiencing their culture and the people and the language is what makes you\
  \ richer and motivates you to explore more and write about it so that later when\
  \ memories fade, you can see the pictures read about it and relive it again. Portugal\
  \ has been there on my list from past many years. If I get this opportunity, I ensure\
  \ to make the most out of it and would take it as a to step a level up in this profession\
  \ of being a travel writer."
