Text: "Sometimes we get so caught up in our day to day life that we forget to stop\
  \ and enjoy the little things. After a fall out with my friends I had to find a\
  \ place to stay for my week in Rio de Janeiro. As my UBER pulled up to the driveway,\
  \ the colour drained from his face as he looked me dead in the eye and mumbled something\
  \ in Portuguese ending with \"...favela\". \n\nOh.... I had booked myself into a\
  \ hostel high up in a favela. For anyone who doesn't know, the English equivalent\
  \ for a favela is slum. \n\nSo there I was, alone with a giant backpack in the middle\
  \ of a favela without a single word of Portuguese to defend myself as the guy at\
  \ the front desk tried to calm my nerves. Within the confusion and anxiety I was\
  \ feeling, I didn't notice the other people in the hostel. An Argentine guy who\
  \ had been living in the favela for the past two years approached me and informed\
  \ me that it was one of the safest favela's in Rio. While it didn't calm me down\
  \ at all, at least I knew that I was safer than I could have been at another favela.\n\
  \nAfter two days barely stepping foot outside the favela after sundown, I sat down\
  \ with the Argentine and had a beer as we talked about life\n\n\"Let's go swimming\"\
  , he said to me with a mischievous smile, he could see that I was tense and uneasy\
  \ about being in a favela. Personally, I had grown accustomed to my safe life that\
  \ I had built myself and it had been a long time since I felt as though I had done\
  \ something wild. \n\n\"Fine, but I better not die\". \n\nI put my phone in the\
  \ locker, chucked my sneakers on and headed out the door with the stranger. But\
  \ before we made our decent onto the beach he took me to see the favela next door,\
  \ one that was more dangerous (a man had been shot there 15 days prior to my arrival).\
  \ After a steep walk down to the beach we took our shoes and socks off and got in\
  \ the water. Full disclosure, I have not stepped foot into the ocean in 2 years\
  \ due to a paranoia of what could possibly eat me whilst I swim in there and at\
  \ night? Never. As I approached the water, he reached out his hand, a stranger until\
  \ then, and I took a leap into the unknown with him. \n\nAs the cold salt water\
  \ slapped me in the face, I realised just how much I had forgotten to live, to enjoy\
  \ the little things and not let the fear and assumptions get the better of me. An\
  \ hour passed and with each wave I jumped I felt as though, life was entering my\
  \ body and I was becoming the adventurous person I was before. \n\nOn our way back\
  \ to the hostel, we spoke of our lives and the things we had yet to learn and discover\
  \ but I was cut short as a boy, no older than 19 with a big gun in his hand. My\
  \ mouth shut and the colour drained from my face just as the UBER driver's had while\
  \ my pace quickened and my new friend just walked by my side and chuckled at my\
  \ reaction. \n\nAs my night came to an end and I lay in my uncomfortable bunk bed,\
  \ with scratchy sheets listening to the waves of the water I had just let wash away\
  \ my anxiety, I had a realisation. There is no need for us to be swamped by routine,\
  \ stress and anxiety, the best way to life a happy life is by doing just as you\
  \ please, by being exactly who wish to be. All I needed to remember this important\
  \ and seemingly obvious fact, was a stranger in flip flops to remind me just how\
  \ free we really are as humans."
