Text: "Four months ago I returned from Roraima State, Brazil - Boa Vista and Roraima\
  \ Mount, accessible by Venezuela. Most of the Tepuis (Table Mountains) are located\
  \ in Venezuela and much of the Roraima massif is part of Canaima National Park,\
  \ which is one of the largest conservation areas in Latin America. \nI was part\
  \ of a group. We walked close to 100 km, in 9 days, on very rough terrain. We were\
  \ 10 visitors - 7 women and 3 men, more 2 guides and 15 indigenous people of the\
  \ Pemon ethnic group. Although they say it's something accessible to everyone, I\
  \ would not recommend anyone to do it without training well before.\n\nFor those\
  \ who enjoy nature, it is a marvelous region - immense rivers, large forests, Gran\
  \ Sabana region in Roraima and Venezuela, spectacular waterfalls. The expedition\
  \ to Roraima Mount was an old dream of mine. There are several Tepuis that stand\
  \ next to each other, when one looks far away. Next to Roraima Mount you can see\
  \ the Kekun\xE1n Tepu\xED .\n\nThe climb was more tiring for me, because we took\
  \ two very hot days, with strong sun and high temperature. We also got heavy rains,\
  \ before the ascent, in the base camp of Roraima Mount. I had no problem with my\
  \ tent, and I slept like an angel, listening to rivers passing by and the rain pounding\
  \ heavily on the roof\u2019s tent. Then we started climbing near the wall and the\
  \ low part of the mount, which has a forest that surrounds it. It took me eight\
  \ hours - an hour longer than the rest of the group. One guy, one guide and I climbed\
  \ together. I really wanted to do the whole tour, but I did not want to get hurt\
  \ or have any more serious problems with knees or ankles. The last part of the climb\
  \ was even slower, because it rained a lot - above normal for the season and we\
  \ got lots of water along the way, descending the hill in the form of waterfalls.\
  \ An unforgettable experience!\n\nOn top of mount it seemed we were on another planet!\
  \  It's all very beautiful, silent. The weather was nice. We had magnificent nights,\
  \ with full moon, clear sky. I have not seen such a sky for many years. I saw constellations\
  \ and the Milky Way. We talk about everything - one's life, life on other planets,\
  \ the geology and geography of the region, the plants and small animals that live\
  \ there. The natives of the region are very good people. It was always very cold\
  \ after sunset and we slept early. I woke up at dawn to go to the \u2018bathroom\u2019\
  \ and stood looking at the beautiful sky with the stars all visible. There are many\
  \ rocks, arranged in the most varied forms, worn by the wind, with very interesting\
  \ shapes. I spent hours, after the daily exploration walks, contemplating all that.\
  \ We took pure water from a varied of mountain\u2019s sources, from the rivers and\
  \ waterfalls in the lower parts. The mountain views are simply breathtaking. \n\n\
  The descent was easier with good weather, but also very cautious.\n\nThe food was\
  \ very good - made by the Indians. We had many sweet fruits to prove and I\u2019\
  ve never eaten so much in my life. I always drank a lot of water.\n\nI went a bit\
  \ earlier to take a look at Boa Vista \u2013 Roraima\u2019s state capital. I visited\
  \ a Venezuelan refugee camp. I also took a trip along the river that borders the\
  \ city and visited tourist sites. The camps are organized by the United Nations,\
  \ with security made by the Brazilian Army. The situation in Venezuela is critical,\
  \ from the stories I heard in the region. The weather in Boa Vista is very hot -\
  \ the population says that you can fry eggs on the asphalt. The city is wooded,\
  \ with wide avenues, quiet transit, beautiful and clean squares. The people are\
  \ very receptive.  The fish in the area are excellent and is the best of their cuisine.\
  \ \n\nI really enjoyed a lot this trekking!!"
