Text: "The bus rocked back and forth as it gripped the edge of the narrow road on\
  \ the side of the Nine Mile mountain in the district of Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica.\
  \ Loose bus handles, clambering broken seatbelts, and the swaying Jamaican morning\
  \ sky cast through the unevenly opened windows. This is all I needed to experience\
  \ to believe that this was \"it.\" Clammy hands and queasiness, along with a rapid,\
  \ palpitating heartbeat enveloped my senses...however somewhere, hiding in the back\
  \ of those senses, something way more sentient arose inside me that was filled with\
  \ zeal and calm reminding me to, \"Enjoy this journey inside your destination, things\
  \ are not what they seem.\"\n\n The bus was moving at a rapid 80 mph alongside this\
  \ long, winding, narrow, dirt-ridden mountainous terrain. I am sure the bus was\
  \ moving closer to 25 to 30 mph looking back. Natives walking alongside the bus\
  \ seemed to come and go in a flurry. I kept praying to God, \"Oh Lord, please don't\
  \ allow anyone to get hit by this bus! And please don't allow this bus to miss a\
  \ turn enkindling our untimely death.\"\n\nWe (my newly wed husband Erik and I)\
  \ were going to topple off of the mountain along with the bus we were on riding\
  \ back from Bob Marley's Mausoleum home tour and it was all going to be over. Anxiety,\
  \ curiosity, and bewilderment hit me all at once. Half naked native Jamaicans comprised\
  \ of children, men, and women wandered the side of the road peacefully bringing\
  \ goods and walking cargo to their metal or wooden huts carefully dispersed along\
  \ the Jamaican mountain terrain. My head was spinning. \"Weren't they nervous walking\
  \ so closely to the bus? Aren't they afraid they may get hit?\" I thought. As I\
  \ watched, their faces were calm, mostly expressionless, with the occasional laugh\
  \ or smile.\n\nMy heart sunk as I watched them wander into their impoverished homes,\
  \ yet, I also felt such wisdom, joy, and simplicity of life among the culture that\
  \ felt so apparent and impenitent during this tumultuous bus ride. \n\n As I watched\
  \ a native Jamaican man walking alongside the bus and looked closely at him, I saw\
  \ the deep crinkled creases alongside his eyes, mouth, and forehead, along with\
  \ the pain, strength, and wisdom in his eyes. There were some serious, possibly\
  \ painful life lessons he has learned and one can see it in his walk, stature, and\
  \ face. There was an abundant peace about him too. He had a story to tell.\n\n This\
  \ was an unashamed, unmaterialistic, and authentic culture residing here in the\
  \ Saint Ann District of Jamaica, the very Nine Mile community Bob Marley grew up\
  \ in, quite the opposite from celebrity culture in Hollywood, CA, in the United\
  \ States. It was raw. It was real. It was damn refreshing.\n\n It wasn't until I\
  \ was able to spot two Jamaican boys laughing, chasing each other alongside the\
  \ bus playing tag. In an impoverished area of the world where one from a more developed\
  \ nation may feel saddened for those afflicted, happiness, peace, and joy can still\
  \ reign in the hearts and lives of the impoverished. \n\nAs I gazed over to my husband,\
  \ his head down looking at the floor and a face cast white, I asked him, \" Are\
  \ you okay? I think we are almost there. I don't think we are dead yet.\" He just\
  \ nodded and cracked a smile.\n\nThe bus came to a gaping halt and the driver of\
  \ the bus shouted in Jamaican dialect, \"Ok everyone, exit carefully. Feel free\
  \ to listen to our reggae band and purchase some Bob Marley memoriblia in the gift\
  \ shop. Have an irie day everyone. Ya mon.\"\n\nAs my husband and I shuffled our\
  \ way, staggering through the bus, holding onto seat chairs and one another to keep\
  \ our balance, the Jamaican sun and the distant sound of Bob Marley's 'No Woman,\
  \ No Cry' song cover from the reggae band enraptured my spirit and reassured me\
  \ that,  we are safe. As my feet hit the dirt pavement, arms outstretched, I said\
  \ to my husband, \"We should have listened to the tour guide and eaten half of that\
  \ brownie, not the whole thing.\""
