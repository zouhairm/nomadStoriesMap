Text: "When we thought that we have explored everything in our city, something emerged\
  \ like a magic and kept us wandering how we could missed it. \nI have seen JalMahal\
  \ a thousand times but this one, the spirit attracted me to go one more step, one\
  \ more mile. We chose to find what's behind the scenes of JalMahal. Another day\
  \ unfolded a surprise of bird watching behind JalMahal. We stroll for about two\
  \ miles to reach there. It was the serene walk way outside the city. Vehicles weren't\
  \ allow to protect air. I found people jogging and spiritual souls meditating near\
  \ park. None of the corner in Jaipur is abstained from temples, that reminds of\
  \ the holy traditional city of India.\nAs we stepped forward, our lungs were fill\
  \ with more oxygen and ears became listener of nature.\nInitially, I cursed the\
  \ gate keeper for not allowing vehicle but it turned to be a blessing in disguise.\n\
  Clouds grouped and turned Jaipur in to a hill station and compled sun to be on their\
  \ back.\nTo explore an unknown place in less visibility is scary yet adventurous.\
  \ One side is Jalmahal and other side is jungle. I found a curvey stair path which\
  \ leads to another temple. I forgot to go there, when the path is so mesmerizing,\
  \ who want to reach the destination. A few local people were meditating here. They\
  \ were the priest & daily visitors. A new guest approached to us. A swamp deer with\
  \ more curvy and tangled horns. It was herbivores but I maintained a good distance\
  \ while clicking his pictures. We walked further witnessing every little thing with\
  \ wide eyes. Flowers, fragrances I never knew that it's also a part of my busy city.\
  \ Energy was draining and we were still far from our destination & also without\
  \ clue. Love is hard and being with a stubborn love mate is also a tough job. Finally,\
  \ I met new friends who graced my city with their presence. In the world of political\
  \ issues, immigration complexity, these birds travelled continents and oceans without\
  \ worries. A flock of birds came evey year in search of food and shelter. I wonder\
  \ about their navigation sense which lead them to the right place every time. A\
  \ compass might have been fixed in their minds. \nI watched different birds from\
  \ Europe, Siberia & Atlanta-the coldest places. Some of the birds were pretty small\
  \ with tiny body, some were fatty ducks, some with long legs and pointed beak like\
  \ a European model with lean figure. These birds have chermishmatic attitude which\
  \ attracts many. Telescope helped me to watch their actions, smooth strolling in\
  \ water, drying their wings, catching prey and moving in groups. I welcomed these\
  \ different creatures with open arms and wished they get for what they had come.\
  \ Our water bodies and atmosphere may fulfil their needs and we could become proud\
  \ host as every year."
