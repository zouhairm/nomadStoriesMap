Text: "Never been known, never realized to make it own on my own.\n   Got a lot of\
  \ things going on my mind, curiousity keeps on haunting me. I was an undergrad back\
  \ then before entering Dubai. Got no idea how to live on my own, since all my life\
  \ I was with my family. Until, then I decided to leave my home, and be working abroad.\
  \ \n   UAE, as a whole was just a dream before. I was very lucky to be given an\
  \ opportunity to work for a company which worked on Photography. Got no idea on\
  \ how to take pictures more pressure since it\u2019ll be my job. With full determination\
  \ I took the chance.\n  Learning not to be afraid of change, that\u2019s why I learned.\
  \ Everyday of years working there, gave an opportunity to absorb new. I was asked\
  \ to take pictures on the highest building in the world,BurgKhalifa. Where you can\
  \ see the entire Dubai, where you felf you almost nearly touching the clouds and\
  \ riding 100 plus elevator will kill you, as if I was riding a huge roller coaster.\
  \ Amazing indeed.\n  Blessed to experience Ski Dubai too. Where negative degrees\
  \ Celsius is you have dealt with for 9 hours everyday, 6 times a week minus off.\
  \ But I\u2019m happy to say, it was very memorable for me riding that chairlift\
  \ as really if, I was in Iceland. \n  Of course, Dubai experience wouldn\u2019t\
  \ be complete without Desert Safari. The coldness of air when it strikes down the\
  \ sand, plus the sunset and the ray light, I can\u2019t imagine that the world can\u2019\
  t be beautiful as that, that\u2019s what I felt.\n  Got to see, Dubai Marina Creek.\
  \ How beautiful that is too. Where I realized that brilliant and great these people\
  \ who conceptualized this kind of business yet creek-park like tourist spot too.\
  \ Expensive yachts and tall buildings around of known businesses plus restaurants\
  \ around. As in luxurious, but walking around too there for free is really priceless\
  \ too.\n  Miracle Garden is a good choice too, if you want a place to relax, and\
  \ just feel the lovely park. You will have to really take a camera or a phone with\
  \ you, because of the sceneries.\n  I thought I\u2019ve seen Dubai enough, until\
  \ I saw Abu Dhabi. I was lucky too experience, Ferrari World. The rides were friendly\
  \ yet shocking to the max. It is really a nice venture with friends.\n  Let me share\
  \ also, my last New Year count down there in Abu dhabi. From work I went straight\
  \ to see my sister who is staying there. We had our New Years Countdown there in\
  \ Marina Mall down to Conrinche, and guess what? Yours truly walked like hours after\
  \ the countdown and waited the morning to go back in the Dubai along street. One\
  \ of the unforgettable experience I encountered but it was very meaningful for me.\
  \ We took shots of the countdown and fireworks were really beautiful.\n  These were\
  \ some of my learning experiences and adventures brought by my decision to work\
  \ here. I\u2019m totally blessed and continuously thanking our Good Lord for making\
  \ these happened. \n  Not everything of course, is good. There are time that I felt\
  \ tested of my patience. You\u2019ll just have to keep reminding yourself or myself,\
  \ the reason I\u2019m here, and that is to work. Working while at the same time\
  \ learning. Not wasting the time and opportunities. Even just smiling or just saying\
  \ hello in the morning when I\u2019m in RTA Metro Station means a lot of positivity.\n\
  \  I always remind myself of my humble beginngs. I\u2019m glad to say that, never\
  \ be afarid to learn new, meet new people, discover places never visited yet. Willingly\
  \ know the culture and adapt to it. Sooner or later, time will tell you that., you\
  \ have grown so much, not better that anyone else. But, better than you( I) were\
  \ ( was ) before. Learning that will make us to be always looking forward but not\
  \ forgetting nor turning our back to our roots. Because, our business in this world\
  \ will not end until you, yourself and the God Almighty decides on it.\n  Let\u2019\
  s all continues to grow, discover and learn wisely with our humble heart."
