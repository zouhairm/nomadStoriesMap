Text: "A young South African woman exits the arrival gate in Barcelona\u2019s El-\
  \ Prat airport. A loud voice calls out her name in the crowd. Startled she glances\
  \ around and finds a tall dark haired woman making her way over. A baby is perched\
  \ on her hip and another child follows. \n\nThis is me meeting my Catalan host family\
  \ for the first time. I smile back at this vivid memory. I was immediately kissed\
  \ on each cheek and embraced with tears. \u2018Welcome to Spain.\u2019 the poster\
  \ read. \n\nBefore this moment I have never met these people. I communicated via\
  \ email and had seen some family photos. And here they were greeting me at the airport.\
  \ \n\nPlanning a journey and actually traveling feels so surreal. While planning\
  \ you never think of how it feels to get on a plane and arrive in a new country.\
  \ Living with total strangers.  Leaving everything behind for a year. What you might\
  \ eat along the way. Or the sights you might see. \n\nThe fact that a family can\
  \ warmly welcome a stranger into their house has always astounded me. \n\nThere\
  \ were many great meals shared between us . Seeing as food is also such a important\
  \ element of culture and traveling. The best seafood that I\u2019ve ever tasted\
  \ has come from the kitchen in our house. Enjoyed many traditional meals and liquors.\
  \ As well as great coffee. \n\nWe have laughed until we cried. Spoken politics,\
  \ religion around the dining room table. \nAs well as enjoy some homemade wine from\
  \ a vinyard. \n\n\nOn weekends we usually go on excursions in the countryside or\
  \ to hockey matches. It is just so much better to explore with people that know\
  \ the small details that you might miss as a tourist. \n\nI have appreciated every\
  \ moment I spent in this family\u2019s house."
