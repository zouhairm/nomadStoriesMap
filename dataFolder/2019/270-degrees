Text: "The wind was relentless. It tore at my clothes and pulled at my hair. I felt\
  \ it push my body forwards then back and I struggled to keep my footing on the uneven\
  \ ground. The late afternoon sun beat down but its heat was diluted by howling squall\
  \ that came so quickly we didn\u2019t have time to bunker down. I closed my eyes\
  \ and breathed deeply, trying to separate body from mind and find some respite.\
  \ \n\nWe\u2019d set off this morning fuelled by instant coffee and drove for nine\
  \ hours through dusty dry terrain that coated the car and camper as if we\u2019\
  d been caught in a red snow storm.\n\nThe man that had told us about this place\
  \ had drawn a crude map on the back of a receipt and we\u2019d followed his directions\
  \ with trepidation but also excitement for we were done with sharing our days with\
  \ strangers. The final road had carved a stark divide through the land, dead straight\
  \ and rippled with corrugations, with no indication of what was to come.  \n\nWe\u2019\
  d come to a gate and as I\u2019d jumped out to open it, the full brunt of the searing\
  \ heat had me feeling like I was cooking from the inside within seconds.  We\u2019\
  d continued on, bumping our way through sad looking fields, so different to the\
  \ lush farmlands of home, passing sheep whose woolly coats looked like they\u2019\
  d never be white again. The undulating lands stretched out before us like dirty\
  \ canvas and I didn\u2019t expect to find the turquoise expanse of the Indian Ocean\
  \ ahead as we drove over the last rise towards our waterfront campsite.\n\nA hoarse\
  \ call for help brought me back from my thoughts and as I opened my eyes, I was\
  \ again assaulted by the fierce winds that are so frequent in this part of the land.\
  \ \u201CQuick Jess! I need you to hold the canvas while I repair the pole\u201D\
  , shouted my husband Dave. I raced to the camper and stepped inside, rushing to\
  \ hold up the cross bar which was in danger of bringing the entire thing down. While\
  \ seemingly blocked from the wind\u2019s fury, it was almost worse in there with\
  \ the canvas walls of the camper acting like a giant sail and continually forcing\
  \ itself on to me with an unsteady rhythm. After five long minutes, and just as\
  \ my arms were about to give out, Dave managed to screw in the aluminium pole, somewhat\
  \ straight after his attempt at bush mechanics.\n\nI let go, enjoying the fire in\
  \ my arms as my blood filled my muscles. We were no longer is danger of being blown\
  \ away and I felt awash with relief. As if Mother Nature was now playing a joke,\
  \ the wind died just as quickly as it had blown up and we laughed at how suddenly\
  \ the mood between us shifted with the calmness that ensued.\n\n\u201CWant a beer?\u201D\
  , Dave asked and I nodded eagerly. We stepped out of the camper in search of refreshment\
  \ and this magnificent place assaulted all my senses in the best way. We opened\
  \ our beers and started walking down the sandy path towards the expanse of water\
  \ in front of us.\nWe\u2019d been on the road for almost three months and the process\
  \ of arriving to a new place after hours of driving, setting up our home and taking\
  \ in our surroundings with a beer had become something of a ritual for us. I was\
  \ amazed that it still brought on the same feelings of awe and appreciation and\
  \ left me with a deep contentment that other places had not sustained.\n\nWhile\
  \ others dream of adventure far from home, there\u2019s something to be said for\
  \ exploring Australia\u2019s western half, as rich in culture and experience as\
  \ the bazaars of Turkey or the relics of Rome.\n\nMonths later, as our trip was\
  \ coming to an end, I couldn\u2019t shake that feeling of a Sunday afternoon and\
  \ held on to that memory of our stay on Tamala Station.  A place that challenged\
  \ expectations and left me full of good memories, lots of stories and an even greater\
  \ desire to get out there and see more of this beautiful country."
