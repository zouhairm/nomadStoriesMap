Text: "As a Korean American, I've been curious about the Korean Chinese. I've been\
  \ pondering what happens to my Korean identity when I cross the Pacific, and what\
  \ happens to Koreans who crossed the Tumen River demarcating China and Korea, only\
  \ five meters wide in some places? Unlike Koreans who became Americans fresh off\
  \ a boat or an airplane, Koreans walked and waded to become Chinese.\n\nThe first\
  \ wave of Korean immigrants arrived as slaves to the marauding Manchus in the 17th\
  \ century. The second wave was because of a refugee crisis in the late 19th century\
  \ when famine struck northern Korea. The turn of the century saw the influx of Korean\
  \ independence activists and my great grandfather who drove trucks for his Japanese\
  \ overlords in the puppet state of Manchukuo.\n\nMany Koreans including my grandmother\
  \ returned to Korea after Japan surrendered, but the majority of them stayed put\
  \ as Manchuria had become their new home. As most Korean Chinese were peasants,\
  \ they unwittingly sided with the communists during the Chinese Civil War and were\
  \ granted autonomy in the early 1950s. Today, about a third of some two million\
  \ residents of the Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture are ethnically Korean.\n\
  \nThe hostel staffs, cab drivers, and restaurant servers were mostly Chinese. The\
  \ only other guest at the only hostel in Yanji was a Han Chinese law student from\
  \ Xian who came in from Mt. Changbai, the highest peak in Korea where the son of\
  \ heaven descended to mate with a bear-turned-woman to engender the Korean people.\
  \ My hostel friend wanted to taste Korean culture, but was disappointed on our first\
  \ night out strolling through neon lights and chowing overpriced Korean food. She\
  \ left early the next day, and I became a solo traveler. I hopped on an afternoon\
  \ bus to the border town of Tumen, where I bought North Korean banknotes and cigarettes.\
  \ \n\nI gazed across the river at North Korea\u2019s pink apartments. I could see\
  \ North Koreans go about their daily lives as dark dots. Standing between us was\
  \ a wire fence on the Chinese side installed about seven years ago. A garden was\
  \ planted in front of it and a white balloon was stuck behind it. Hanging over the\
  \ fence was a navy jacket, which might have been used by one of 30,000 North Korean\
  \ defectors who left the totalitarian regime. Unlike the North-South border, the\
  \ Korea-China border was serene.\n\nTo my dismay, Korean culture was confined to\
  \ cuisine and Korean signs in the prefectural capital of Yanji. I've traversed the\
  \ Silk Road and the Tea Horse Road, and despite Beijing's efforts to maintain its\
  \ empire through ethnic erasure, Uyghur mosques and Tibetan temples stood proudly\
  \ as reservoirs of culture. I didn't spot any Korean temples in Yanji.\n\nSo I visited\
  \ the Yanbian Museum, and it was surreal to see Korean culture preserved in wax\
  \ figures wearing Korean garb. The museum felt like a state sponsored compensation\
  \ for the lack of Korean culture in everyday life, but I also learned a few factoids\
  \ about my motherland. A museum sign stated bluntly that \"Koreans like to sing\
  \ and dance,\" and it was not just talking about K-pop.\n\nKorean Chinese reached\
  \ the stratosphere of Chinese arts that Korean Americans can only envy. The composer\
  \ of the anthem of the People's Liberation Army is the late Korean Chinese Zheng\
  \ Lucheng. China's father of rock Cui Jian whose songs became anthems of the student\
  \ protestors in that tragic summer of 1989 is Korean Chinese. China's premier choreographer\
  \ who turned into the first transgender celebrity Jin Xing is also Sino Korean.\n\
  \nKoreans are the 14th largest among the 55 officially recognized ethnic minorities\
  \ in China, and one of the most highly educated and wealthiest minorities as they\
  \ are in America. Koreans first landed in America as sugar cane workers in Hawaii,\
  \ and then as students, independence activists, then laundry and restaurant owners\
  \ in continental America. Just as North Korea's founding father spent his formative\
  \ years in northeastern China, South Korea's founding father spent his formative\
  \ years in northeastern America. Given the current stalemate on the Korean Peninsula,\
  \ perhaps the Korean Diaspora in the two superpowers can help broker a detente."
