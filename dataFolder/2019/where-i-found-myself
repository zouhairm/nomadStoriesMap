Text: I think I was so quiet that the girl next to me was trying to speak with me
  in Persian ,"I can speak Pashto so you can speak on your language." I said ,she
  just laughed and started speaking. In the other hand there was our councillor dancing
  all the way ."Where we are?"he shouted,and all the campers were screaming with a
  loud scream "Imagica". Here,at the funfair with the amazing name of Imagica the
  weather was very hot.Our director bought us tickets and we started walking around,we
  may different people from different places and tribes but the first thing that took
  my eyes was a big roller coaster.My friend and me sat at the last seat and the roller
  coaster started moving,it was somehow old and it transmitted the feeling that we
  might fall at any moment but at the bottom there was a very interesting and green
  view.Due to the warm and humid weather of india it is all green.Then I saw my teacher
  was calling us so we went to him and he showed us a horror house,it was a train
  of people waiting there,India has a large population because every where is crowded
  . finally it was our turn,two girls and I went to that,every where was dark with
  some skeletons that were hanged form ceiling with a loud evil laugh I found that
  the girls named Fatemah and Hadia.It was fun I was laughing and that girls was shouting
  that suddenly a man that his face was full of blood standed next to the Hadia and
  she started crying at the moment I huged her."It's all right"I said,after a long
  distance that we passed we went out of that,with considering all the things it was
  fun and there was one of the places that every one should go once.In that day I
  found India as a great country with many places that everyone should visit and its
  people,they are kind and hospitable. We were in India 21days and I found a new life
  there.
