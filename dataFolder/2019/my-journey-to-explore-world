Text: "Traveling is one way we learn many things. Many types of travellers range from\
  \ flash travellers, backpacker, \u201Cbeg packers\u201D also a luxury packer. Each\
  \ type of traveller has their own goals. What about me? In visiting new places,\
  \ I mingle with local people, learn their culture, learn their habits, and visit\
  \ authentic places. Blending with local people made me learn about the thinking\
  \ patterns and wisdom of the local community. Learning how they interact, communication,\
  \ perspective on life even about things that can be duplicated. In Amsterdam, I\
  \ learned to shop in several supermarkets, payment must use Credit or Debit Card,\
  \ Cashless solution, this is very different from what happened in my country, Indonesia.\
  \ In Bavaria province, Germany I learned how local people really appreciate the\
  \ comfort of other communities in public places. In Japan I learned how time means\
  \ a lot to Japanese people, they really value time. Just 1 second means a lot to\
  \ them.\nAs a quote from Bryan Tracy, \"every great move forward in life begins\
  \ with a life of faith, a step into unknown\", everything that happens in our lives\
  \ is always at the beginning of believing what we do always has a minimal impact\
  \ on ourselves. ourselves or even to many people. I believe visiting amazing places\
  \ in the world will bring us different people. Many people think by visiting many\
  \ places we will get a lot of inner peace and happiness, but for me visiting many\
  \ new places makes me feel I am still small things compared to the world. This makes\
  \ me grateful and also improve myself by adding local insights from the location\
  \ I visited.\nWhere do these things end? I honestly do not know the exact end of\
  \ my trip to visit locations that I have never visited. But what I know for sure\
  \ is that the trip made me a better person, more respect for differences, seeing\
  \ the world from a different perspective because I saw from various perspectives\
  \ of the local community that I had visited. One thing I certainly do from all this\
  \ is that I want to always share my experience with so many people that what I experience\
  \ has an impact on many people.\nSo, I'm ready for the next journey on my life and\
  \ I will share to others"
