Text: "Cuba; a place of vibrancy and colour like nothing else. My travels there well\
  \ and truly exceeded expectations. Cuba is a place full of beauty and decay. A feast\
  \ for the eyes and the soul. \n\n\PMy first impressions on arrival were that things\
  \ happen slowly. It\u2019s what the locals call \u201CCuban time.\u201D Essentially\
  \ this means adding 30-60 minutes onto a time you are given and that\u2019s when\
  \ action is going to happen. (However, if someone says to you\_ma\xF1ana,\_meaning\
  \ tomorrow, it\u2019s probably never going to happen!).\P\n\nMoving through the\
  \ streets of Havana was like being in a time warp. It is old school cool. The colorful\
  \ old cars, salsa sounds and the distinctive smell of cigars. The beautiful locals\
  \ in the streets speak in an aggressive yet happy way as they sit on their doorsteps\
  \ and balconies watching the world go by.\_In the late afternoon you will find people\
  \ of all ages dancing in the streets. And do they have the moves!\P\n\nWith the\
  \ lack of infrastructure, the best way to see this beautiful country is on an organized\
  \ tour. My group turned out to be 12 single, solo travelling woman, like myself\
  \ and one couple (the poor fella). Our tour leaders first words of warning were\
  \ that in 48 hours each of us would have a marriage proposal; Cuban men don\u2019\
  t muck around!\n\nOne challenge was the limited Wi-Fi. You must purchase a card\
  \ that gives you allocated time online. Naturally it is incredibly slow as everyone\
  \ is all trying to use it at the same time in the same place. You will see people\
  \ huddle around the squares, aptly names screen central, trying to access this glitchy\
  \ Wi-Fi. However, it was quite refreshing to be somewhat disconnected during my\
  \ time in Cuba. \n\nCubans really are warm, welcoming and hospitable. On my first\
  \ day I found a restaurant around the corner from my accommodation. When the waiter\
  \ discovered I was from New Zealand he was so excited. I was from a fantasy land\
  \ he had only ever heard about on the TV and movies.\_ He even went out the back\
  \ to get his colleagues to show them this mystical creature. He was glad to have\
  \ me in his country and told me Cuba was my home now.\P\n\nLearning about the revolution\
  \ was also fascinating, particularly the woman of the revolution. And of course,\
  \ Che Guevara. They still have so much love for him. I was lucky enough to be there\
  \ when the new president was announced in April last year; Migel Diaz Canel. The\
  \ only inkling that any kind of election and change in government was the two police\
  \ cars we saw following a single bus going to the National Assembly for the decision\
  \ making. Apart from that there was no suggestion that there was no longer going\
  \ to be a Castro in charge of Cuba after over five decades of rule.\P\n\nWe discovered\
  \ Cubans really pride themselves on their education system, healthcare and low crime\
  \ rates. Post revolution Cuba had a huge literacy campaign and now have the highest\
  \ literacy rate in Latin America.\_ Today education and healthcare are free and\
  \ there is one doctor and nurse in every village. Since the revolution a lot of\
  \ money has been invested in the arts and culture and their national ballet is up\
  \ there with the best in the world.\P\n\nIt was also nice to move beyond Havana\
  \ and walk through the tobacco fields, stay with locals in their own homes, salsa\
  \ dance at the local bars, swim in the beaches with golden sands, and party in a\
  \ nightclub in a cave. We walked the cobbled colorful streets of the villages where\
  \ cowboys still ride through the town on horseback.\P\n\nCubans live simply, but\
  \ they are happy, beautiful people and it has to be the most wonderful place I have\
  \ visited so far in my life.\_ While at times it was like being in a time warp,\
  \ it was refreshing to immerse myself more than perhaps I would have done on my\
  \ previous travels. There is a rawness and vibrancy like nothing else, which is\
  \ still painted beautifully in my mind."
