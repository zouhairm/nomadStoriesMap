Text: "A long time ago, I wrote about a group of Chileans that had to leave the country\
  \ when they were still children. After the coup, many of their fathers were kept\
  \ prisoners while many others had to hide to avoid becoming political prisoners.\
  \ They had to leave the country and go into the exile with their families. \u201C\
  I wasn\u2019t kicked out of my country. I was 9 years old. They were looking for\
  \ my father. He was in exile, not me\u201D, tells me Marcela, one of the many children\
  \ that had to leave Chile in the seventies. \n\nThose were complicated times and\
  \ many governments took an active role They gave visas to persecuted people, political\
  \ prisoners and people who were blacklisted by the Chilean authorities. Consecutively,\
  \ many Chileans arrived in Sweden, Spain, Venezuela, and France. For this reportage\
  \ I would like to focus on the case of France\u2026 \n\nThe stories of those children\
  \ are somewhat different, as they had to live in a country with a language that\
  \ they didn\u2019t know. Many of their parents never bother to learn and kept repeating\
  \ \u201CWe are going back soon\u201D. But the children coped faster with the new\
  \ customs as they went to schools were they had to learn the new language and ways.\
  \ After a while they became the nexus between Chile and France. \n\nThose children,\
  \ now adults, are neither completely Chilean nor French. They're half and half.\
  \ One half is the tourist that came to the country \u201Cfor a little while\u201D\
  \ as their parents told them, nonetheless, that \u201Clittle while\u201D turn out\
  \ to be 16 years until the exile finished in 1990. \u201CWe had our suitcases under\
  \ our beds\u201D, told me Marcela, a woman who now lives in France. \u201CThey kept\
  \ repeating \u2018we\u2019re going back soon\u2019, but we never did\u201D. She\
  \ has a life in France now, she studied there, she got married and now she helps\
  \ other immigrants to adapt. \n\nThe other half, is when they accepted that they\
  \ made their lives in France as residents. I want to know how it was. How it was\
  \ to change their personal relationship with that place, from tourist, to resident,\
  \ to native. \n\nUnexpectedly, I like this story. It sounds like it\u2019s going\
  \ to be a sad story, but I\u2019ve learned, that many of these second generation\
  \ in exile are very resilient. They are very open to talk about their story, because\
  \ they see it as way of healing, a way of mending their past and their parents\u2019\
  \ pain. Also, they have become more empathetic with other migrants. Stories like\
  \ these give me many writing opportunities, not only by writing their stories, but\
  \ also their parents\u2019, how they saw that place as tourists at the very beginning\
  \ and the way in which they made it their home. \n\nI want them to show me the places\
  \ where they grow up, where they use to hang out when they were children, teenagers,\
  \ and now adults. As they are more integrated into the French culture I would like\
  \ them to show me what makes them feel French and what makes them still feel Chilean.\
  \ The differences tend to be more obvious in the kitchen; the flavours that take\
  \ them back and the flavours they learned to love. The music, the smells, the colours\u2026\
  \ going back and forth in time through the senses, but with more emphasis on flavours.\
  \ \n\nI want to take this course to improve my abilities, master writing and be\
  \ able to describe a sense. I remember as a girl, I read a book about a witch who\
  \ was punished to travel in time five centuries ahead. At some point she describes\
  \ a cream that she prepares with almonds. It wasn\u2019t a real recipe, and she\
  \ made it with magic, but the description of the flavour was so clear and intense,\
  \ that twenty years later I can still feel that almond cream in my mouth. I want\
  \ to master those descriptions that can make people dream about something they\u2019\
  ve never had."
