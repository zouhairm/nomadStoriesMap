Text: "\u201CCa ne se fait pas.\u201D That\u2019s inappropriate. She glared through\
  \ me with ice blue eyes, no effort to hide the shock in her words as she continued\
  \ to voice her criticism to her mother. My curiosity peaked. What distressing event\
  \ had happened that a French teenager would point out, let alone notice? In my confusion\
  \ over her reaction, I thought over the last few moments and realized that she was,\
  \ in fact, glaring at me. I was the one who had committed the faux pas. \n\nIt was\
  \ December 2017. Despite the grey sky and bitter wind, my relatives and I found\
  \ charm in the town square, joyously taking poorly posed selfies in front of the\
  \ titanic Christmas tree that towered above all other buildings nearby. I had 50\
  \ centimes in my pocket leftover from a souvenir I purchased for my boyfriend back\
  \ home. There stood an older white man quietly begging for money in the center of\
  \ one of the oldest Christmas markets in Europe while around the corner, adjacent\
  \ to the entrance of the 580-year-old Romanesque cathedral of Strasbourg, a displaced\
  \ immigrant family of 6 played guitars, sang, and made efforts to smile to each\
  \ other and their market audience. They brought warmth to that place, despite their\
  \ desperate situation. Being at the front of a crowd by a few feet, I spotted the\
  \ band and was able to spend a few moments to myself, dropping the few coins I had\
  \ in their hat and smiling back with understanding. That\u2019s when she said it.\
  \ I soon realized the subtext in her dispute and turned around defensively. In the\
  \ cloud of thoughts that mirrored the horror and angst I felt within my gut at my\
  \ cousin's reaction I managed to squeeze from my throat a single, impartial question,\
  \ \u201Cpour quoi?\u201D Why? In French, my cousin huffed back at me, \u201CYou\
  \ shouldn\u2019t have given them any money. I would have given it to the old man.\u201D\
  \ \n\nWhere did this prejudice come from? As a child, I was vaguely aware that France\
  \ was a population made of multicultural Francophones from all over the world, indisputably\
  \ a result of French colonization in the 19th century. My mother, being from France,\
  \ used our summer vacations as an opportunity for us to spend time there, getting\
  \ to know her culture, her family, and her experiences living in Europe. In public\
  \ school I remember learning about our American history and our unfortunate relationship\
  \ with slavery and racism, so by 11 years old I had concluded that France was more\
  \ \u201Cwoke\u201D than the US. In fact, I saw my first interracial couple when\
  \ I was a child in France and wondered why this didn\u2019t seem to exist at all\
  \ back home in Florida. Then, in the spring of 2017 when French police forcefully\
  \ removed 2000 refugees and migrants who had tried to establish some sense of stability\
  \ on the streets of Paris, my understanding of French inclusion was shaken. \n\n\
  Upon reflection of what had happened in the market, I recalled a conversation around\
  \ the dinner table with my French family that took place the month before. Three\
  \ generations unrestrained, engaging in discussions circling French politics, the\
  \ manifestations, and immigration. Every once in a while they would include me in\
  \ discussions on American politics. Not French. Perhaps they felt I was an outsider\
  \ despite our genetics coupled with my time spent abroad. Really, I felt too ashamed\
  \ of what was happening in my own country to comment on theirs. Then in some gest\
  \ as if trying to relate with his Yankee granddaughter, my grandfather spoke to\
  \ me aside as we cleared the table. He facetiously told me he\u2019d like to meet\
  \ my boyfriend one day, as long as he wasn\u2019t a black. The table continued to\
  \ clear and the only evidence of the troubling exchange was my disbelief. His words\
  \ had refuted every assumption I had made as a child. They would come back to haunt\
  \ me that afternoon in the market square."
