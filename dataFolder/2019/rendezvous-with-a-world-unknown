Text: "As we seek happiness in the luxuries of the outer world, we often forget that\
  \ the greatest joys of life lie in the simplicity within!! In an attempt to seek\
  \ solace from the busy city life my body and mind were urging for break. So I started\
  \ browsing the internet ' safe places to travel in India for female solo traveler'\
  \ there was a huge list available but what grabbed my attention was a name unknown\
  \ and unheard - \"Auroville\". I was so intrigued that I decided to set off for\
  \ this journey, without any clue of what is the place about and what does it have\
  \ in store for me...\nAuroville is a small town located approx.12 km from Pondicherry,\
  \ tamilnadu, south of India. It is an international town for spirituality. A budding\
  \ idea transformed into a magnificent reality!! This city was envisaged by a French\
  \ disciple of Sri Aurobindo called Mira Alfassa aka MOTHER. The city is an epitome\
  \ of modern spirituality and functions mainly on volunteer basis. The lifestyle\
  \ so unique and infrastructure so splendid its almost impossible to describe in\
  \ mere words.\nAs auroville mainly functions on volunteer basis the best way to\
  \ experience this place is to be a volunteer, there are umpteen choices on the website\
  \ through which you can choose as per your interest and availability. The best thing\
  \ about being a volunteer:\n\u2022\tCheap accommodation\n\u2022\tMost places serve\
  \ complementary breakfast\n\u2022\tSafety\n\u2022\tMore interaction with community/volunteers\n\
  \u2022\tSatisfaction of giving back to community\nSo I choose a 2 week volunteer\
  \ programme at an organic farm called Buddha Garden\nI reached Auroville without\
  \ any expectations or spiritual inclination. However; the moment I entered the green\
  \ dense areas of auroville my heart was filled with strange positivity.\nI entered\
  \ the premises of Buddha garden where Rajan welcomed me and asked me to wait at\
  \ the community kitchen.\nAs I entered  I saw a group of people of different age,\
  \ gender, nationality and language interacting merrily some were cooking in the\
  \ kitchen while others just laid down on the mat. The kitchen was a simple room\
  \ with basic culinary amenities where the volunteers would have breakfast in the\
  \ morning and could cook their own meals. The group immediately welcomed me with\
  \ warmth and i blended like I belonged there forever.\nI was then allotted shared\
  \ dormitory with a common bathroom. \nMy roommate was a  French lady who could speak\
  \ only French. Yet language was never a barrier for us and we interacted beautifully\
  \ and shared a great bond throughout.\nAt Buddha garden we would work from morning\
  \ 6 to 9 and then the entire day was free to explore auroville or do things as you\
  \ please. The steaming healthy Indian breakfast, post work was heavenly.\nI realized\
  \ that auroville is a not only a spiritual place but an amalgamation of various\
  \ communities. They have various farms, dairy, bakery, small scale industries and\
  \ communities that work mainly on volunteer basis with bare minimum requirements\
  \ and focus on environment conservation.\nEveryday Various centres at auroville\
  \ conducted several workshops/seminars/classes which we could choose and attend\
  \ as per our likings.\nThe primary attraction of auroville is the matrmandir where\
  \ several tourists flood in for the divine experience and enlightment.\nThough I\
  \ was not a spiritual person I visited the matrmandir as  tourist (prior bookings\
  \ necessary), however as I entered the premises and learnt more about the history\
  \ of this place I was enthralled how a barren land transformed into a beautiful\
  \ dream with mere volunteers. The inner chamber architecture was one of a kind and\
  \ the experience was completely heavenly; as I meditated infront of the crystal\
  \ globe a strange divine feeling struck into me and unknowingly a tear shed of my\
  \ eye. \nThe principle of auroville was enhancing the consciousness of human beings\
  \ and making them humane.\nThey followed the principles of Indian culture: meditation,\
  \ yoga, selfless living, simplicity, peace, mantra chanting etc. which as country\
  \ we were forgetting. It made me so proud to be an Indian and helped me discover\
  \ our rich heritage.\nI came here as a tourist but never expected to leave a piece\
  \ of my heart and soul with a promise to return again."
