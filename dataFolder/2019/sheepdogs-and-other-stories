Text: "I am definitely a dog's person. There is something about these creatures that\
  \ just attracts great stories and new adventures! It wasn't any different on my\
  \ last trip to the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nFor those who don't know me, Nica is my\
  \ Border Collie and travel companion - even though she gets carsick quite often.\
  \ Even though I couldn't take her with me this time, I seemed to lure sheepdogs\
  \ wherever I went, and they all led me into knowing the most amazing people!\n\n\
  I rent a car in Bragan\xE7a, a city located in the beautiful region of Tr\xE1s-os-Montes,\
  \ also known for the rich wildlife and stunning landscapes of Montesinho's natural\
  \ park. My first stop was the village of Moimenta, next to Spain's border, where\
  \ I was welcomed by a shy black and white dog who led me to the Contrabando Museum.\
  \ There, I met an old contrabandist - like most of the elder villagers once had\
  \ been -, who told me all about the commercial activity that was a daily part of\
  \ the community for years.\n\nOn my next stop, a big and furry Border Collie was\
  \ standing right in front of a closed temple in the Spanish village of La Mezquita.\
  \ Although there was not a soul around, its owner suddenly came up when I started\
  \ petting it. He was the one who took me to the lady in charge of the keys. She\
  \ most kindly offered to open up the temple for a visit. In spite of the community's\
  \ name, she explained in her best galelo accent that is was not a mosque, but a\
  \ Christian church as old as the village itself.\n\nMy final destination was Pueblo\
  \ de Sanabria, a city that mixes an astonishing 12th century architecture with amazing\
  \ lake views. There I happened to meet my last four-legged friend of the day! The\
  \ owner of this blue merle Border Collie had grown up in the village and told me\
  \ all about its historical facts and secret spots.\n\nNica, who is indeed a very\
  \ sociable pet, was not around this time to help me overcoming my shyness. Nonetheless,\
  \ thanks to my passion for dogs, I was lucky enough to discover very special corners\
  \ of Portugal and Spain and to connect with wonderful people who were living history\
  \ themselves!"
