Text: "So, we planned a trip that would put us in Oman for just over a week. The trip\
  \ was setting itself up to be an experience of a lifetime. Oman is one of those\
  \ rare places that because not many other people have caught on to how incredible\
  \ this part of the world can be, and how friendly and welcoming these cultures really\
  \ are, that make it a place that you should visit right now. While there are plenty\
  \ of places that you\u2019ll want to experience in Oman \u2013 and the more you\
  \ learn about the country, the deeper you\u2019ll want to dive into the different\
  \ landscapes and adventures that it has to offer \u2013 the most obvious place to\
  \ start is the Musandam Peninsula, which is only a few hour drive from Dubai.You\
  \ see, the landscape here is rough. There\u2019s little to no vegetation. The temperatures\
  \ can be unforgiving in the summer. The sea is a deep, mesmerizing green that looks\
  \ both inviting and terrifying. This is truly a place where nature reminds you just\
  \ how little you are in this big, incredible world.With outdoor showers, touches\
  \ that pay respect to the Omani culture, and an architecture that fits right in\
  \ with the landscape, this is a place that not only provides an elevated escape,\
  \ but an elevated escape that still reminds you where you are in the world \u2013\
  \ which is something that five-star hotels more often than not lose in their experience."
