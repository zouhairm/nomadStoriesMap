Text: "Since 2016 I have been in search of various alternative yoga retreats, mostly\
  \ on a budget. I am on a journey of exploring the world through yoga and meditation,\
  \ and other physical activities,m that are good for my holistic health and well-being.\n\
  \nSummer 2017 I ended up booking on a whim a yoga and surf retreat in Morocco. Flights\
  \ were reasonably cheap around April/May time to Aragir, approximately \xA370 return,\
  \ and for approximately \xA3500, this included - airport transfers to Thaghazout,\
  \ morning and evening yoga, and surfing lessons during the day for 7 days, breakfast,\
  \ lunch and dinner all included.\n\nIt all sounds to be true so far, and you are\
  \ not wrong to assume so. \n\nThe very basic hostel where I shared the room with\
  \ 4 other strangers with no air conditioning, was tough enough, but we also had\
  \ to share our very basic shower with 10 other people.\n\nAfter an exhausting day\
  \ of fighting against the waves, just to surf for 2 seconds, this was super demanding\
  \ on our bodies, and the last thing you want is an uncomfortable bed, sharing with\
  \ other strangers, in a hot room and to add to injury, we all in turn got terrible\
  \ food poisoning which spread across the village like the plague. \n\nYou can imagine\
  \ the horrific pain we were all in having to wait in line for the toilets and shower,\
  \ it ended up being a real shitty mess, we all got very up close and personal with\
  \ each other, as well as the Moroccan family that ran the hostel!\n\nIt all started\
  \ well, and it ended horrificly badly and messy. One, none of us will forget that\
  \ were on that particular retreat. \n\nThankfully, when we were able to attend our\
  \ yoga classes, those were worthwhile as we all bonded on another level loiking\
  \ out for each other, but the cost of a nasty stomach airborn bug on a yoga retreat,\
  \ was the last thing I expected from my retreat!\n\nThe sunrises and sunsets in\
  \ Thaghazout are out of this world, so if you can stomach the Moroccan stomack bugs,\
  \ and dodgy hostels, you are in for a treat!\n\nAlso, another pisitive about Morocco,\
  \ they are one of the first countries in Africa, even the world, to ban plastic!\
  \ \n\nSo, not all bad, just do better research beforehand, and of course avoid my\
  \ mistakes, and take plenty of Immodium and Dirilyte, and make sure you are not\
  \ sharing bathrooms with 100s of people."
