Text: "A fresh start to a new year by eating a bunch of grapes along with wine on\
  \ every strike of the bell surrounded by the hundreds of people enjoying the lighting\
  \ festival at Montjuic Magic Fountain show in Barcelona. This is somehow my new\
  \ year start this time by looking at other peoples doing such stuff.\nI\u2019m travelling\
  \ to the major cities in Europe started from Barcelona on 30th December without\
  \ making any plans, budget and intentions or any fucking to-do list.\nMy first task\
  \ is always to go to the red light areas of the city (La Rambla street) and to have\
  \ sex but just to see the beautiful stuff. In Barcelona, it\u2019s not that much\
  \ number of girls but enough to have a good time. Looking at blonde girls while\
  \ walking through the streets asking them about the prices gives me a different\
  \ kind of satisfaction. After doing the same stuff in the mid of night then I went\
  \ back to the hostel.\nThe next day I wake up till the half of the day had already\
  \ gone, this time I wanted to do something different from last night so I went to\
  \ the Beach watching the waves, observing peoples who are pretending to have a really\
  \ good time on the last evening of the year. After all, this what I wanted is just\
  \ food but with me, there is a problem that I only refer to eat only Indian food.\
  \ So I went to an Indian restaurant and order a veg Biryani.\nMy plan was just to\
  \ watch that lightning festival, capture videos and pictures then went back to the\
  \ hostel and have a nice sleep."
