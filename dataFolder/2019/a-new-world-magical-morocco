Text: "Wow, that was all I could say when I landed in Morocco.  A world to caress\
  \ your senses and your imagination.  Was that Ali Baba I saw turning the corner\
  \ in the Fez Medina - or Laurence of Arabia in the Sahara Desert?  The sounds, the\
  \ smells, the sights, the tastes, the feel of Morocco is like nothing else I have\
  \ ever experienced.  Learning to drum in the desert while kittens roaming in the\
  \ camp kept us safe from scorpions or nocturnal nasties whilst providing us with\
  \ affection and fun;  shopping in the local market before sharing a picnic by an\
  \ oasis which is cool and tropical;  riding a horse along the beach at Essaouira\
  \ before enjoying a meal at one of the local outdoor restaurants.  These are some\
  \ of the magical sights that stand out until I remember Marrakech.  Nothing compares\
  \ with the transformation of the Jemma el-Fnna from the busy market place that it\
  \ is during the day with snake charmers, comical dentists and other magicians and\
  \ entertainers to a vibrant  array of food stalls with tastes to tantalise your\
  \ taste buds and have you coming back every night for more.\n\nMorocco is a land\
  \ of contrasts from being able to climb the Atlas Mountains and enjoy a home stay\
  \ with delicious home cooked food.  Have your hands painted with Henna in a traditional\
  \ pattern by one of the family members while listening to stories about the local\
  \ people and places of interest.  Visiting a museum where there are countless skeletons\
  \ of dinosaurs outside and an array of local crystals inside.  Visiting a local\
  \ hamman where you have to strip off to your undies and if you are shy like I was\
  \ and try to leave your bra on - don't bother as the lady looking after you will\
  \ insist on you removing it.  Now what an experience that was - forget about your\
  \ 5 star spas .... nothing has ever come close to this amazing experience and the\
  \ feel of your skin afterwards is amazing...and if you go with some girlfriends\
  \ you will laugh so much that your abs will feel like you have just been to the\
  \ gym.  \n\nAnd lets not forget Casablanca - of course you have to visit Rick's\
  \ bar and have a drink but number one on your list of places to visit is the Hassan\
  \ II Mosque - the largest in Africa and 5th larges in the world with the world's\
  \ tallest Minaret.  The Moorish architecture is exquisite and intricate and takes\
  \ your breath away.  You can while away many hours gazing at the beautiful mosaics\
  \ and watching the waves around the Mosque as it is jutting out over the ocean.\
  \  \n\nThe Fez Medina still captures my imaginations whenever I remember it.  Donkeys\
  \ pulling carts who have right of way when turning a corner, bakers making bread\
  \ the traditional way, walking through a door into a 3 story old palace within and\
  \ then walking through a street where you have to go single file and sometimes sideways\
  \ to fit down a street dating back to the 8th Century.\n\nAs I write this blog I\
  \ am reminded of why I loved the place so much and why I tell everyone I know to\
  \ go there.  A place where you feel very safe, where you enjoy the food, where you\
  \ are amazed at the natural sights as well as the manmade ones.  Listening to the\
  \ call to prayer is musical and a delight to hear 6 times a day.  \n\nAnd lastly\
  \ have I talked about the doors?  These gateways into wonders beyond them are incredible.\
  \  The colours, the designs, the intricacies - they invite you to linger and imagine\
  \ what delights are behind them as if you are lucky enough to get a peek behind\
  \ them you will find lush gardens and beautiful Riads waiting for you.\n\nDon't\
  \ hesitate if you ever have a chance to go on the road to Morocco, you will never\
  \ regret it and you certainly won't be bored either.  If you are lucky enough you\
  \ may even see goats standing in the Argan trees - another unique Moroccan sight!\
  \  The many beautiful buildings that you will visit behind huge walls will captivate\
  \ your imagination forever."
