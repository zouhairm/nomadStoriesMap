Text: "\"Are you doing anything today?\" \nI looked up from where I was sitting on\
  \ the worn couch in the common room. I'd just finished hauling a giant backpack\
  \ from the train station and up the stairs of the hostel where I was staying in\
  \ Port Elizabeth, South Africa. I needed a shower, wanted a nap, but my time was\
  \ limited in this unassuming coastal town that I had included in my recently-lost-my-job\
  \ trip that was supposed to help me take my mind off feeling like a failure. \n\"\
  I haven't planned anything yet,\" I answered the hostel receptionist who I now saw\
  \ was accompanied by a thin man who looked to be in his 50s. \n\"There is a private\
  \ tour of the township leaving in 20 minutes. One of the other guests will be going\
  \ as well.\"\nThirty minutes later I was in the backseat of a small grey car that\
  \ the man from before, now our driver, tour guide, and translator, was maneuvering\
  \ down dusty streets and cracked pavement. Our guide, Sizwe, lived in the township\
  \ with his family and brought in money by visiting the local hostels to see if anyone\
  \ wanted to tour his home. As we drove down the streets he taught us Xhosa words,\
  \ laughing as we tried to click our tongues and pronounce the words in the effortless\
  \ way he did. He told us how he was trying to set up a website to promote our tours.\
  \ When we made our first stop, a school inside the perimeters, he explained the\
  \ structure of the classes and let us wander around the grounds now void of students.\
  \ Another stop was made at one of the bars that looked like it might moonlight as\
  \ a club, one room dim and smoky with purple lights highlighting the features of\
  \ the only other patrons in there\u2014two men who were more than happy to answer\
  \ our questions that became more raw and childlike as the evening wore on. Had they\
  \ seen someone killed in this place? Yes. Did they want to live somewhere else?\
  \ Yes. Finally it was time to move on and, after more stops at significant locations\
  \ we'd never heard about, we made our final stop at a small home. It looked no different\
  \ from the other brick, mortar and tarp homes spread out around us but when Sizwe\
  \ stopped the car we soon realized this was his home. We weren't sure what to do\
  \ when he invited us to come in. We hadn't been given an itinerary before leaving\
  \ and the last thing we had expected was to make someone's house a spectacle on\
  \ our tour. But we followed Sizwe in nonetheless, the man emitting the same pride\
  \ of someone who was giving a tour of their five bedroom, five-and-a-half bath house\
  \ in Connecticut. We were greeted by his wife and daughter, whose parents were so\
  \ clearly proud of her academic accomplishments. There was also the faint smell\
  \ of food cooking. The house was put together in squares. A square for the living\
  \ room, a square for the kitchen and I assumed a square for the bedrooms. After\
  \ a few minutes chatting with his family, translations provided through Sizwe, instead\
  \ of packing us up in the car to leave we were told, \"please sit down and we will\
  \ eat dinner.\" It was unexpected but welcomed after the long day. We sat down and\
  \ were awarded with chicken, rice and a vegetable that looked like a potato. Over\
  \ the meal we talked about Nelson Mandela, Sizwe's pride that this was the oldest\
  \ township in South Africa and his daughter's love for tennis. We took pictures\
  \ together and offered to help clean up when we were full from dinner. His wife\
  \ graciously told us no. I saw Sizwe's pride in his wife as well. When we stepped\
  \ outside the sun had set and Sizwe drove us back to the hostel. I can't say my\
  \ life was changed, that this day was a turning point, but I can say that this was\
  \ one of many moments that made me realize life is life and you have to take pride\
  \ in what you have, no matter where you want to be."
