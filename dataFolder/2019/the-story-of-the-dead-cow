Text: "It was the first and the last visit to a little mountainous village somewhere\
  \ deep in Osetia. She thought she knew about the village\u2019s strict traditions,\
  \ but in reality everything went wrong. \n \nShe and her husband came to the village\
  \ very late at night. No lights, no sounds, only light wind shaking the trees and\
  \ silhouettes of mountains framing the village. Strange, strange feelings. \n \n\
  \ She was awakened by loud voices of cows waiting to be milked. It was her first\
  \ day in her husband\u2019s native place. She was introduced to her husband\u2019\
  s mother, a young enough woman wearing a traditional black dress with dark brown\
  \ eyes in her silent face. No emotions. She spent all day with the women of this\
  \ family. No men. Unfortunately, she took no notice, and it was her first mistake.\
  \ \n \n Everything happened in the evening. She came into a dining room. A big,\
  \ wooden table full of plates of various sizes and colors. Cheese and fruits. Meat\
  \ and vegetables. Jars with water and bottles of wine. And men. Only men. \n \n\
  \ A lot of astonished eyes looked at her: her husband, his father, his grandfather,\
  \ his brothers, and uncles. \n \n\u201CWhat is she doing here?\u201D she heard.\
  \ \u201CWOMAN, this is no place for you!\u201D  \n \n\u201CIt is a bad sign. She\
  \ will bring a hoodoo.\u201D \n \n\u201CBut I want to be with my husband. I don\u2019\
  t understand why\u2026\u201D \n \nWhy\u2026 \u201CWHY\u201D was her alarm clock\
  \ the next morning when she was awakened by a terrible scream. \n \n\u201CMy cow!\
  \ My best cow is dead. This woman broke our traditions.\u201D"
