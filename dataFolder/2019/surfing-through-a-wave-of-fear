Text: "I moaned and rolled over to turn off my distastefully loud alarm clock at 6:45am.\
  \ I am in Honolulu, Hawaii, so why am I foregoing sleep on vacation?\n\nAside from\
  \ the fact that my whole trip to Hawaii had been completely impulsive and last-minute,\
  \ though the hit to my bank account was a good reminder of its veracity, I had also\
  \ used quite thoughtless judgment on my first night in the Aloha state. Riding off\
  \ of the YOLO mentality and peer-pressured by my friends, I stayed out at a club\
  \ in Waikiki until 2 AM. When everyone had finally settled in for a good night\u2019\
  s sleep at our small hotel, I remembered that I had reluctantly agreed to surf with\
  \ a friend on the island first thing in the morning.\L\nWith the ultimate goal to\
  \ live it up in Hawaii, I let the alarm clock win the ongoing battle for my sleep.\
  \ We unfortunately had 8 people crammed into one hotel room, so I quietly shuffled\
  \ to the bathroom and threw on a bikini, ready to give surfing in Hawaii a go.\n\
  \nI already had a text from Connor that he was on his way to pick me up and take\
  \ us to a local surf spot. He was providing me with a board, a ride, and good spirits,\
  \ so how could I let exhaustion stop me?\n\nI made my way to the hotel lobby and\
  \ trundled out the door. Even in my partially slumbering state, I noticed how wonderfully\
  \ warm and tropical the Hawaii air felt. \L\nConnor was patiently waiting, with\
  \ 2 long boards strapped to the top of his car. I hopped in and off we went.\n\n\
  I didn\u2019t tell him, but I had only surfed a handful of waves in my whole life,\
  \ all in north Florida. A good day for surfing in Florida usually involves 3 foot\
  \ waves. A Hawaiian wave was obviously going to be a daunting challenge, and I was\
  \ already succumbing to the pressure.\n\nWhen we arrived at a crowded surf spot\
  \ in Waikiki, I could see the waves were pumping and there was no shortage of surfers.\
  \ It didn\u2019t even phase Connor. He unloaded our boards and ran at the massive\
  \ expanse of water in front of us.\n\nI followed behind him, attempting to overcome\
  \ a wave of nausea, that confusingly could have been due to a hangover or a possible\
  \ overwhelming amount of fear.\L\n\nI stepped into the ocean and walked out until\
  \ my feet could barely touch. Though a bit jumpy, I began the paddle out towards\
  \ the lineup. I could only catch glimpses of Connor in between sets but I made my\
  \ way out towards a large group of local surfers and properly positioned myself\
  \ among them.\n\nA ripe wave was building up and gaining momentum. As I sat on my\
  \ board, I looked over my shoulder at the wave that was beginning to peak. I must\
  \ paddle right now, amongst of sea of surfers, or forever miss my chance. \n\nEven\
  \ with nervousness filling my heart, I knew I could not hesitate.\n\nAs a flurry\
  \ of people, including myself, begin to paddle, I hold my breath and pray that I\
  \ am one of the lucky ones who catches it.\L\nI see locals and tourists, alike,\
  \ dropping like flies as the wave begins to peak under their boards. I am merely\
  \ a novice surfer, but I know this is my chance to catch a real 5-foot wave in Hawaii.\
  \ Paddle, Lexi, paddle.\L\n\nI catch it. \n\nI am shredding the gnar in Hawaii.\
  \ \L\n\n\u201CYea, Lexi! Whoop whoop!\u201D, Connor yells at me, as he pumps his\
  \ fist in the air and throws up a shaka.\L\n\nWhen we left the beach that day, I\
  \ couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of accomplishment. I surfed a Hawaiian wave,\
  \ I overcame fear, and I was damn glad I had set my alarm clock."
