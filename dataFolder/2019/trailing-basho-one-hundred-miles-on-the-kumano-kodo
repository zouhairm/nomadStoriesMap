Text: "Matsuo Basho believed in what the Japanese call mono no aware: appreciating\
  \ the beauty of fleeting moments. In 1680, at the age of 37, he took up a life of\
  \ wandering. He roamed through the wilderness, chasing inspiration for his poetry.\
  \ For the most part, he wrote about ephemerality: the song of a cicada, the moment\
  \ before a frog splashes into a pond. Basho went on to become Japan\u2019s most\
  \ famous haiku poet, and also my muse. Inspired by Basho, I hiked over 100 miles\
  \ of Japan\u2019s Kumano Kodo pilgrimage, beginning in Osaka and ending in Ise.\n\
  \nSitting in my off-campus apartment, I appreciated Basho in the abstract. I loved\
  \ the idea of becoming more meditative and mindful. I read articles about wayfarers\
  \ and wanderers, wondering what it would be like to depart from my everyday life.\
  \ Supported by a Terry B. Heled Research & Travel Grant from the Kelly Writers House,\
  \ I planned my pilgrimage. I set out to write about poets and pilgrims, and about\
  \ the meaning of Basho\u2019s wandering.\n\nI met my fellow pilgrims at a restaurant\
  \ in downtown Osaka, where we shared sashimi while discussing our expectations for\
  \ the trek. I had decided to participate in a guided Walk Japan tour of the Kumano\
  \ Kodo. I had learned that nearly all the signs of the Kumano Kodo are in Japanese,\
  \ making solo travel as a non-Japanese speaker an iffy proposition.\n\nMy fellow\
  \ pilgrims were, for the most part, married Australian couples in their sixties.\
  \ They were seasoned hikers, speaking of recent treks across Mongolia, Myanmar and\
  \ Tibet. I had my answer to my research question. Who is the modern-day pilgrim?\
  \ Apparently, Australian empty-nesters.\n\nThe next morning, we were Koya-bound,\
  \ shooting through the majestic mountains of Wakayama on a bullet train. My first\
  \ glimpses of the trail revealed the natural beauty that inspired Basho's belief\
  \ in nature as the source of man's salvation. The cedars and cypress were intercepted\
  \ by Buddha statues, red gates and bridges that promised the path to eternal paradise.\
  \ \n\nThe Kumano Kodo became like home to me. Growing up in Northern California,\
  \ I grew accustomed to the way sun spills through the slats of redwood trees. During\
  \ the hikes of my childhood, I stared down at the treetops from mountain summits.\
  \ I became familiar with the dense green of forests and the dirt path of trails.\
  \ Nestled in the mountains of Wakayama, I had to remind myself I was no longer in\
  \ California. Aside from the Japanese trailhead signs and the relative thinness\
  \ of Japanese redwoods, the terrain was similar. As we drew closer to the Japanese\
  \ view of the Pacific Ocean, the Australians sang Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201CGoing\
  \ to California.\u201D\n\nI have always been a mountain girl, happiest at elevation,\
  \ whether in forests or in snow. I am a certified yoga instructor and have tried\
  \ all the popular forms of meditation, discovering that nothing is as effective\
  \ for me as walking. While on the Kumano Kodo, I experienced a quietude and calm.\
  \ I understood how Basho could spend his whole life like this, roaming among the\
  \ redwoods.\n\nThere was a pattern to our days. We rose early, sliding into our\
  \ robes and wooden slippers for a breakfast of rice and fish. It was silent in the\
  \ ryokans, save for the chattering of birds. Morning light sliced through the blinds\
  \ and I could sense the gentleness of the tatami mats under my feet. We trekked\
  \ up slippery cobblestones to gates shrouded in mist. Backpacks slung over our shoulders,\
  \ we flitted between conversation and silence as we walked.\n\nI thought about Basho\
  \ often. Mostly, I was moved by how he strived for a simple life, the fusion of\
  \ himself with the trail. I walked for 100 miles to witness the abundance of cedars\
  \ and cypress, mountains and forests, gates and bridges, sunrises and sunsets. When\
  \ I arrived in Ise, the sacred city that marked the close of my pilgrimage, I knew\
  \ my journey had just begun. I dreamed of future treks, to Big Sur and Mount Tam,\
  \ to Muir Woods and Cascade Falls. I dropped my backpack and pulled out my pen.\t\
  \n\t\nFair Basho was here:\nStraw shoes passing through the shrine\nAs he journeyed\
  \ on."
