Text: "My alarm went off at 6:00 am. I quietly climbed down from my hostel bunk bed\
  \ and quickly grabbed what I needed to get ready for the day. The night before I\
  \ stayed up quite late visiting with a friend, so I was tired but very determined\
  \ to check this next adventure off of my list. It was my second time visiting and\
  \ exploring Portugal. The first was the year prior, and not only my first solo trip\
  \ but also my first time to Europe. This time was different though. I had created\
  \ an \"Adventure Bucket List.\" Which is why when I woke up this particular morning,\
  \ I kept on task. \n\nI stood in front of my small space of a locker digging through\
  \ all my clothes trying to find a suitable outfit for today's adventure. In all\
  \ honesty though, I had no idea what I was getting myself into, and for that reason\
  \ I was very excited. By 6:45 am I had called for an Uber and within a matter of\
  \ minutes had arrived. Since my arrival to Porto, Portugal two days prior, I was\
  \ very pleased not only with the beauty, people, and food, but also the accessibility\
  \ to transportation. Trains, Ubers, Taxis, Bikes, and Boats were always within walking\
  \ distance. However, I was ready to see a different side of how to get from point\
  \ A to point B. \n\nMy Uber driver picked me up, drove me a few miles just outside\
  \ of Porto where I then was dropped off and ready to take on the day. The entire\
  \ ride I had barely saw anyone awake and outside, but once I arrived at my destination\
  \ I was then surrounded by a couple hundred people. I made my way to where I saw\
  \ people \"checking in\" and gave them my name. They greeted me with much kindness\
  \ and checked off my name. I was then instructed to stay close and they would introduce\
  \ me to who I would be riding with. The gathering was a charity event to raise money\
  \ for a local organization, which I happily contributed to. The exciting part was\
  \ that we would be riding on motorcycles across the country throughout the breathtaking\
  \ Douro Valley wine region. As I stood there, I remember looking and listening to\
  \ people around me. No one was speaking English and I was definitely the only one\
  \ who had sent an email to their event coordinator asking for a ride.\n\nAbout an\
  \ hour goes by and people are on their motorcycles slowly filing out of the parking\
  \ lot. Nearly everyone has left and there he was, my driver. He walks up to me,\
  \ \"Hi, I'm Renato.\" I introduce myself and he hands me a helmet. Renato was about\
  \ my age, and drove an old Suzuki motorcycle that later I learned, could go very\
  \ fast. We both hopped on the bike and made our way following behind hundred bikers\
  \ and towards the Douro Valley. It was incredible. The views, winding roads, calmness\
  \ of the morning, and even more impressive- sense of community and family. \n\n\
  Three hours go by and we make a pit stop for lunch in a small village. All the bikes\
  \ are parked on a bluff area with an over-look point. I snacked on a small pastry\
  \ and was invited to grab coffee with a few riders. We came back after our coffee\
  \ break, hopped on our bikes and took off. Our next stopping point was about another\
  \ 2 hours away where we then relaxed and shared lunch with each other. It was during\
  \ this time I felt nearly emotional with how kind and welcoming the Portuguese are\
  \ with not only each other, but also in how they treated me. The views are breath-taking\
  \ yes, and the wine is delicious, but the culture is unlike anywhere I have ever\
  \ experienced. \n\nAfter lunch we pack up our things and made way back to Porto.\
  \ This time we drove on the highways so we could get back sooner. Renato knew I\
  \ loved going fast, so we often led the way this time. The sun setting to our left,\
  \ moon rising to our right.. It was just the start of the adventure."
