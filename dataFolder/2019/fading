Text: "The undulating waves of his autumn colored hair sweetly challenged the still\
  \ gray color of the sea-bordered sky. It was a spring day in the merchant's harbor\
  \ but the vernal freshness of March wore a frigid white costume that bore a striking\
  \ resemblance to Skadi, legendary Norse daughter of Frost. Her bite, albeit a gentle\
  \ one, sent stinging streams of  cold chills zipping through my veins. Still, I\
  \ had to go. Losing my passport meant that I couldn't leave. Laws dictated that\
  \ I couldn\u2019t stay. So we reluctantly  bundled up and left the Albertslund kommune\
  \ of Copenhagen on foot, with a steely determination to abort this purgatory sojourn.\
  \ \n\nHaving visited Denmark twice in three months, I had played the role of tourist.\
  \ My brown eyes saw kaleidoscopic lamps paint the night sky at Tivoli. I felt the\
  \ sea-battered bronze of the Little Mermaid statue. I heard the indiscernible sounds\
  \ of a street, of brightly painted townhouses, overrun with tourists at Nyhavn.\
  \ Freetown Christiania\u2019s green light district possessed a distinct aroma, and\
  \ the majestic neutrals of Amalienborg gave me a taste of what it must feel like\
  \ to be royal. In deed, a florid painting of a bright, idyllic \u201CKobenhavn\u201D\
  \ had been composed, framed and hung in the gallery of my mind.  \n\nSapphire galaxy\
  \ seats in an Ruby red rail-car carried us to the arch covered platforms of Copenhagen\u2019\
  s central \u201CS-Train\u201D station. An escalator escorted Lars and I to a bustling\
  \ concourse where coffee shops, currency exchanges, restaurants, and Danes warmly\
  \ robed in various shades of black and grey infused the landscape.  \n\nWe entered\
  \ the Copenhagen Police station through double doors made of glass. A stern but\
  \ helpful police comprised of both men and women, contentedly chatted and attended\
  \ their daily assignments. My passport had been found and forwarded to the U.S.\
  \ Embassy (sixteen minutes from the station). I reunited with my passport. At last,\
  \ I could relax.\n\nHalfway home, Lars stopped and asked me, \u201Cwould you like\
  \ to take a little stroll through Albertslund?\u201D I was tired but couldn\u2019\
  t  say \u201Cno\u201D to the prospect of learning more about the place that birthed\
  \ and shaped my companion.\n\nI asked him why Albertslund meant so much to him.\
  \ With perfectly executed English, his thick Danish accent dissolved to a whisper.\
  \ He explained \u201CAlbertslund is like an oasis in the midst of a desert. There\u2019\
  s human heart behind this place. People of different ages, nationalities, abilities\
  \ and races come together here and do things together without regard to our differences.\u201D\
  \  \n\nHe was right. Hedemarken, politically defined as a \u201Cghetto\u201D in\
  \ Albertslund, emitted colors so rich they transcended paint and lights.  A Muslim\
  \ boy wearing a sunshine yellow parka and a sky blue cap, played games with his\
  \ mother under a tangerine colored arch. A Danish mor and her daughter wore pink\
  \ sweaters while observing community hens in \u201CThe Egg Castle.\u201D There were\
  \ basketball courts, playgrounds and play structures throughout. Signs in the windows\
  \ of a cafe, pizzeria, market, and several laundromats all donned the word \u201C\
  \xE5ben.\u201D \n\nAlbertslund was a sanctuary,  but was it really that different\
  \ from other places in Denmark? Lars explained, \u201CI live in a country that\u2019\
  s getting more and more politicized and polarized.\u201D \u201CDanish media and\
  \ politicians are propagating the idea that we can\u2019t trust those we don\u2019\
  t know.\u201D \n\nThis assertion sharply contrasted the colorful, equality-centric\
  \ country I\u2019d come to know. Did racism really exist amongst the Danes? A little\
  \ research led me to the article,  Racism goes mainstream in Denmark.  It affirmed\
  \ that Danish officials have openly declared their intent to pass tougher immigration\
  \ and integration laws, and have already implemented some of the most restrictive\
  \ immigration policies in the Western world.\n\nTwo unidentifiable faces veiled\
  \ by ski masks were the first we encountered on our trek.  Affixed to a burnished\
  \ aluminum signpost  that stood at, and commanded our, attention was a round tattered\
  \ sticker.  Above the faces in red was the word \u201CRevolution\xE6re.\u201D  \u201C\
  Antifascister\u201D was written below them in black. It was then that I realized\
  \ that the vibrant colors were beginning to fade as I found myself reflecting on\
  \ the possibility of a less colorful, black, white and red Denmark."
