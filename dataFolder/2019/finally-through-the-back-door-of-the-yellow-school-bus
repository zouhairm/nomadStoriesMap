Text: "I spent ten years of my life getting on and off big yellow American school\
  \ buses as a child and teenager, being picked up at home (near home more likely,\
  \ as I seem to recall a few freezing walks to the bus stop) and dropped off at school.\
  \ The back door of the bus, emblazoned by its large \"emergency exit only\" brand\
  \ always made it a completely devilish pull. There was always a desire to grab that\
  \ large handle and escape from this forbidden portal, but the risk had never been\
  \ taken. Ten years later, on my first yellow school bus ride in Nicaragua, as the\
  \ local from Managua to Granada was pulling out of the station without me, the operator\
  \ opens the back door while the bus is in motion and waves me in after confirming\
  \ my final destination. I climb the stairs as the bus is already accelerating away,\
  \ just in time to make the one and a half hour journey.\n\nIt is my guess that Nicaragua\
  \ is where the majority of these aged yellow monsters so familiar in American suburbia\
  \ come to die when they are too decayed for our haughty standards and \u201Cbuy\
  \ a new one\u201D culture. Besides aesthetically, they seem to be in very good shape.\
  \ I never saw one broken down on the side of the road like the countless buses of\
  \ other countries. Better mechanics? Better drivers? Better luck?\n\nAfter exploring\
  \ lovely Granada, a colonial city of bright color and shady trees, on foot, I headed\
  \ back to Managua on a similar ride, sharing another worn-out but perfectly reused\
  \ yellow American school bus with Nicaraguans, all traveling for their own reasons.\
  \ On this ride, I was able to answer the question of \"If everyone else jumped off\
  \ a bridge, would you?\" The answer was a resounding YES for me, as everyone on\
  \ the bus jumped off near what seemed to be the starting point of my previous bus.\
  \ To my dismay, I was thoroughly lost in this sea of dust and smog and after 30\
  \ minutes of trying to find my way before Google Maps would have allowed it, I hailed\
  \ a taxi to bail me out. I never did figure out where I was, somewhere off the boundary\
  \ of the paper map I was carrying."
