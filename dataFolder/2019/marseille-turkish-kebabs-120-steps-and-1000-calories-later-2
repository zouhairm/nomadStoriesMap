Text: "When I disembarked our cruise liner that morning, I expected the competing\
  \ scents of lavender and freshly baked croissants to welcome me on France\u2019\
  s southern-most coast.  I was wrong. It did not work out that way. \n\nWhat I did\
  \ not expect was to stroll into the Marseille city-centre from the Old Port, to\
  \ find myself navigating through a party of demonstrators, protesting against a\
  \ fuel hike!  As a South African passport holder, I felt like joining in solidarity\
  \ given that back home, we too, feel the pinch of fuel price hikes routinely, but\
  \ there were sites to see and the tour bus waits for no man. I soldiered on.   \n\
  \nI was besotted by Marseille even before I arrived. I can thank the late Anthony\
  \ Bourdain\u2019s Parts Unknown for that, when he shared the wonders of Bouillabaisse\
  \ with me through my 52 inch screen at home.  Despite the contrast of dilapidated\
  \ buildings metres from the more froth and bubbles atmosphere of the city-centre,\
  \ there is something captivating about a city that doesn\u2019t try hard (or at\
  \ all) to be beautiful \u2013 but just is. This is the best way to describe Marseille.\
  \  \n\nGuided by my belly and a nose that had sniffed out something delectable within\
  \ walking distance from the port, I wandered into a side walk takeaway-cum-cafe\
  \ called Turkish Kebab and Pizza. I also did not expect to find that the best food\
  \ I\u2019d eat in Marseille would be in the form of a Turkish kebab! Succulent pieces\
  \ of cubed chicken in a feather light, crisp, buttery naan marinated in an other-worldly\
  \ creamy sauce with just the right amount of masala to compensate for the bland\
  \ cruise food I\u2019d been eating for days prior. It reminded my taste-buds that\
  \ they were indeed alive and well!  Outstanding! \n\nSatiated, I wandered into a\
  \ street market filled with locally made lavender soap, hand-crafted wooden salad\
  \ spoons and cotton scarfs.  I had, admittedly, na\xEFve expectations of Marseille\
  \ \u2013 I had romanticised the port city based on the online images of cerulean\
  \ waters and ethereal churches, but it has far more character than that.  \n\nWhat\
  \ struck me, as a third-world passport holder, is that in this famed first world\
  \ city, the realities of poverty  were still felt. We walked passed homeless, some\
  \ speaking languages from the east and it reminded me of the headline reports of\
  \ refugees that fled civil unrest ridden regions like Qaraqosh and the like, to\
  \  Marseille.  I was far removed from this reality when it was on the news \u2013\
  \ it was never that tangible watching from afar.  \n\nThere is a calmness that Marseille\
  \ imposes on those who wander its streets. It felt safe.  \n\nI spent the day marvelling\
  \ at the Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde, a Catholic church and arguably the\
  \ best known landmark in Marseille. About a 1000 calories later having trekked up\
  \ the carved 120 step stone staircase, I was rewarded with a panoramic view of Marseille\
  \ in all its glory \u2013 the view may have been breath-taking but I was panting\
  \ for a different reason\u2026.    \n\nI had just enough time to admire the giant\
  \ ferris wheel near the old Port and the Monument aux morts d'Orient a little way\
  \ further before trekking back to the ship. Roughly translated it\u2019s a monument\
  \ to fallen soldiers, specifically a tribute to those who lost their lives in the\
  \ First World War while stationed in eastern regions. The monument is epic \u2013\
  \ it was architecturally designed to depict victory by way of bronze statue of a\
  \ woman with outstretched arms facing upwards, which statue sits under a giant stone\
  \ arch. It overlooks the Mediterranean sea and it is a powerful image. \n\nMy day\
  \ in Marseille was a world wind of history, culture, religion and the best Turkish\
  \ kebabs I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of tasting! My advice to potential travellers\
  \ is to grab an opportunity to visit Marseille if it ever arises, approach it without\
  \ any expectations and appreciate it for the charismatic mix of what it does have\
  \ to offer: a culture-rich and historic coastal city, with its own brand of magnetism."
