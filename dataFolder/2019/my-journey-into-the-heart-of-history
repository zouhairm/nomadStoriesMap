Text: "This is the tale of my travel experience to hampi.\nHampi is a UNESCO world\
  \ heritage site ,for it is known for the ruins of the vijayanagar dynasty. I had\
  \ hampi on my list since a long long time,but it was just not happening for me..\n\
  But suddenly in the January of 2019 things started to fall in place and i could\
  \ put my plans together for my much anticipated trip to hampi \nI took a night bus\
  \ to hampi from goa, and it was a long journey i must say, but once we entered hampi\
  \ ,i could tell it was going to be worth it. The ruins and ancient sculptures come\
  \ into view as soon as one enters the place and the change in scenery is a welcome\
  \ sight.\nHampi world heritage site is situated on the south bank of river tungabhadra\
  \ ,and the northern bank is called virupapura gaddi or as people like to call it,\
  \ \"the hippie island\". My accommodation was arranged on the southern bank ,so\
  \ i took a ferry ride across the river to reach the hippie island and i was floored\
  \ immediately . The vibe of the place is so relaxed and laid back ,i could feel\
  \ all my restlessness fading away.\nThe first day ,we decided to explore the northern\
  \ bank... We went to see the waterfalls and the sanapur lake. We took the coracle\
  \ ride, which is a tiny bamboo basket and the villagers use it as a vessel to go\
  \ across the river. Then we went off road for a while, and the views that greeted\
  \ us are still etched on my mind. The paddy fields were the most vibrant of greens\
  \ and the faraway hills all made of rocks precariously balanced one on top of the\
  \ other. \nThe sunsets in hampi are a love affair i wouldn't mind having, all i\
  \ had to do was climb atop a boulder and watch as the sun goes down on another day.\
  \ \nNow there is only one way to spend the evenings in hampi and that is to cozily\
  \ settle in one of the cafes, and order some awesome food while enjoying the impromptu\
  \ jam sessions ,you can even join in if you are willing. I , myself became a part\
  \ when one of the musicians handed me the percussion device and i happily joined\
  \ in.\nThere are lots of temples in hampi. The ones on the northern bank are active,\
  \ while the southern bank temples are not active temples, they only stand on ruins.\n\
  The day we explored the heritage site was a special day. We took a tuktuk which\
  \ is an auto rickshaw actually but locals call it tuktuk and it sounds much cuter.\
  \ \nThe place was first set up in the 1300s ,and that was 700 years ago which took\
  \ me a while to process. Walking on the ancient grounds was a surreal feeling. The\
  \ once high and mighty have now been reduced to ruins and rock clusters,which if\
  \ one comes to think of is all that will happen to all of us. And yet we keep running\
  \ the ratrace for success. Anyway, i was drifting on a different train of thought.\
  \ Now coming back to hampi, food on the south bank isy limited to mostly vegetarian\
  \ and south indian cuisines which is what we tried and also liked. The cafes on\
  \ the northern bank offer a wide range of cuisines because it caters to a wide variety\
  \ of tourists from various countries who come there to leave behind the tiresome\
  \ cities and unwind for a while. \nScooties and cycles are the way to get around\
  \ in this place and its worth it because you can simultaneously appreciate the scenery.\
  \ Connectivity in this place is poor which is an added bonus because in today's\
  \ time to go away from connectivity is a luxury in itself. It gives you time to\
  \ just disconnect from all and try to connect with self.\nThe trip to hampi was\
  \ a soul trip for me and I will be back there soon. I hope i could do some justice\
  \ to this place with my words. Signing off here, \nA happy hippie !"
