Text: 'I live in kohat, peshwar and attend a trip  with my friends. None of us knew
  each other before coming to college, but we were all brought together by sheer luck.
  Our friendships have blossomed and we have been on so many adventures together throughout
  the first semester of school. It was sad to be heading home for winter break, but
  when we returned to school it felt too good to be reunited!

  Our first weekend back we decided to take a trip to lahore , which is about 1200
  km away from kohat. We found a parking spot, and strolled to the pier to find florescent
  lights and fresh smells. I am a videographer so naturally I filmed some of the fun
  moments with my friends and later turned it into this video.

  We went to wagha border, and took pictures of soldiers performing the army parates
  and indians sitting behind the border. This day  of spontaneity is now one of my
  favorite memories with the friends and I will cherish it always.

  Traveling makes memories and opens ones heart and creates connection with people
  you met and learn about their cultures and life style. This traveling opened my
  mind and now i travel every where i have seen almost every city of Pakistan and
  now i am in great desire to travel in foreign countries and explore their culture
  and meet new people and learn about their cultures and share my Pakistani culture.'
