Text: "Sri Lanka, a land well known in the Indian Ocean, yet remains unexplored for\
  \ most of its landscape. Not only does it have the beautiful beaches, but also adorns\
  \ places of worship, breathtaking terrains, a connect with nature & animals, and\
  \ a dash or splash of peace.\n\nFrom a night stays at good homes, to enjoying colorful\
  \ bus rides moving place to place during the day, it was all fun for an adventurous\
  \ and enthusiastic traveler.\n\nNo sooner did I step on this land at late hours\
  \ on a November evening, I was set for a journey through the highways to touch a\
  \ culturally rich city of Kandy, which houses the sacred tooth of the Buddha. The\
  \ environment is enchanting and an experience of its kind. The city is blissfully\
  \ colorful with rains and cold winds welcoming you round the clock in a day!\n\n\
  As Mythology states, the called Monkey King - Lord Hanuman has his piece of land\
  \ here, now referred to as Nuwara Eliya, the rich black tea plantations of the country.\
  \ Swirl around this place with 1 of the top 5 best train rides of the world, with\
  \ its Historic Railway station taking you back to the era of the British Times.\n\
  \nIf there was a 8th Wonder of the World, it would have been Sigiriya - The Lion\
  \ Rock. Offering luscious green facades with hidden rocks as gems, scale upto the\
  \ top to witness whats hold below from where you started. Its a marvelous view.\n\
  \nThe religious and historic reflection of the country is Polonnaruva. Beams of\
  \ columns through which you wander gives you an idea of the preserved culture of\
  \ the land. \n\nThe true culture is Annuradhpura, a place of the famous 'Dagobas'.\
  \ Peace prevails here. Colors that add to the sanctity here are the white apparels\
  \ of people and the clear blue skies. Navigating by a local Auto rickshaw makes\
  \ your travel picture perfect at this place.\n\nOne of the noted points of Sri Lanka\
  \ is Galle. Galle has everything close to its edge adjoining the shore of the Indian\
  \ Ocean. Walking around this town and its bylanes is one of the best things for\
  \ a small leisure in your trip, but be careful, you may stay back here ! Its lighthouse\
  \ makes way as a refernce standpoint navigator.\n\nThe city Colombo, has a lot to\
  \ show. The town here stands by the name 'Town'. Wide lanes with a good transport\
  \ system makes it the rightful capital of Sri Lanka. With a good combination of\
  \ sky scrappers and 5 Star hotels looking over the sea shore makes Colombo an ideal\
  \ getaway for a holiday.\n\nThe Dehiwala Zoo is one of the best Zoo's in Asia. A\
  \ Trail of 6 hours will make you fall in love and awe with the premises and friendly\
  \ animals housed here. The mini forest here welcomes you with Parrots, and they\
  \ make an ideal companion for quite sometime for you, in their own environment.\n\
  \nOne of the things which we as humans should take pride is of the way Sri Lanka\
  \ cares for Elephants, by way of the Pinnewala Elephant Orphanage. From feeding\
  \ them Bananas, you and Milk, you can watch them having a bath in the adjacent river\
  \ - a sight one longs for. The connect of the Elephants with Nature makes you realize\
  \ how much you missed on enjoying nature.\n\nFood is what drives you here. From\
  \ Egg filled Apams, to Rotu Kottu, and lip smacking Rice Plates, you definitely\
  \ have a variety in front of you. Sea food is all your call, with a long list to\
  \ choose from. The flavored drinks - Ginger Beer and Cream Soda stand out and appeal\
  \ to one and all.\n\nSri Lanka truly means a lot to a traveler who has explored\
  \ this land. One can go back home, cherishing their journey. \n\nOh ! Not to forget,\
  \ the view from the flight window seeing the colorful brown roofed houses, while\
  \ sipping the Sri Lankan beer - Lion, makes it a great finish for your trip :)\n\
