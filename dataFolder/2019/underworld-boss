Text: "The brutal blow seem to come out of nowhere.\nIt struck me right between the\
  \ eyes.\nOne minute he was friendly and inviting,  then angry and explosive the\
  \ next.\nIt caught me off guard. I hadn\u2019t estimated the emotions that could\
  \ boil over from his docile character.\nIt was deceiving. He was deceiving. He was\
  \ not a friend, he was asserting his territory and dominance.\nThis small but feisty\
  \ fish continued to strike my dive mask from all angles. He was relentless in his\
  \ attack; darting back and forth. I had entered his world, his domain, his neighborhood\
  \ and he was letting me know that he wasn\u2019t having it. \nMy sister and I had\
  \ literally dived into a different world. We were fulfilling a bucket list dream\
  \ of doing the Padi open water scuba dive course; and no better place this could\
  \ be achieved, but in the Red Sea- off the eastern coast of Egypt.\nThe 5 day course\
  \ consisted of practical and theory instruction, revision and tests. The local master\
  \ dive instructor, Mohammad (did you expect a different name?!), made the theory\
  \ side as painless as possible, while teasing us with intervals of water based practice.\
  \ \nBased in Sharm el Sheik, we were in A diving Mecca. I would estimate 90% of\
  \ people here have come to dive. People travel from all over the world to sample\
  \ this sublime underwater world.\n The coast was humming with the sound of boat\
  \ motors in the morning; calm, glossy waters tantalising our thirst for the deep\
  \ blue. The smell of salt mingled with coconut scented sunscreen lotion. The scene\
  \ was set for our first open water dive; after two long sweaty days in a classroom\
  \ and practice in the hotel pool.\nIt was my turn to leap into the sparkling ocean.\
  \ I could already see parrot fish circling just below the surface.\nWith one hand\
  \ on my five mask and another in the air, I leapt off the boat and into another\
  \ world.\nIt was perfection. Immersed in a foreign watery world where we were the\
  \ aliens. Pretending to be one with aquatic creatures for as long as our dive tanks\
  \ would permit us.\nThe pristine clear waters were only a few degrees cooler than\
  \ the air temperature; a balmy 28\u2019c , so no wetsuit was needed. It was pleasant\
  \ and comforting to feel the warm, salty water brush against my arms, my lips, my\
  \ face. To be enveloped in its saltiness, and at the mercy of its power seemed strangely\
  \ comfortable.\n The scenery was more than I could have imagined. Numerous species\
  \ of beautifully patterned fish going about their business, old boat wrecks in their\
  \ watery grave, vibrantly colored corals decorating the rocky outcrops, dappled\
  \ sunlight penetrating through the clear waters - highlighting  the kelidiscope\
  \ of mesmerizing sea life.\nThere was so much to see that I couldn\u2019t take it\
  \ all in. Animals I had only ever seen in \u2018Finding Nemo\u2019 were now casually\
  \ swimming around me. I had found my passion, in the heavens below, in this underworld.\n\
  It was serene and almost perfect until I was unmercifully attacked by a territorial\
  \ and testy triggerfish. Brought back to reality by a fish twenty times smaller\
  \ than myself.\nMy tranquil serenity broken, I made a quick retreat and reminded\
  \ myself I\u2019m in their world now.\n I am merely a visitor. A foreigner."
