Text: "It isn\u2019t often I feel the pangs of regret; in fact, this is the only time\
  \ I can remember feeling the previously unacquainted haunting of what could have\
  \ been. Fortune was on my side, however, because that ghost was only with me for\
  \ two years. \n\nA few summers ago, I found myself fortunate enough to be in the\
  \ warm and ever-lively kitchen of an apartment in a five-hundred year-old building\
  \ on the Piazza Santo Spirito in Florence, Italy \u2013 my favorite city in the\
  \ world.\n\nThis inviting place would charm me enough to ensure my return the next\
  \ summer and the summer after that.\n\nMy host, Bernardo, was bedridden due to an\
  \ accident playing football, yet his easy and charismatic nature was far more noticeable\
  \ than his constant horizontal state.\n\nHis kindness (and perhaps his ridiculous\
  \ handsomeness) had earned him the privilege of having many friends stop by the\
  \ place to cook for him and keep him company. Nearly every night, the home was filled\
  \ with laughter, delicious food and music. I felt as if I had stumbled into someone\u2019\
  s dream life, and here it was just a random Airbnb I had chosen on a whim. \n\n\
  One sticky-sweet evening, a friend brought wine from their family-run vineyard,\
  \ and another placed an open cardboard box on the well-worn wooden table. Its humble\
  \ paper folds opened, revealing the most magnificent selection of colorful and fragrant\
  \ fruit, freshly picked from their grandparent\u2019s garden. This was Florence,\
  \ I realized. Friends and love and family and food. I remember my heart swelling\
  \ as it does when you are finally home.\n\nEveryone prepared dinner together and\
  \ generously shared their wine, food and stories. They sat by his bedside and chatted\
  \ and comforted. Surely the warmth from those true connections filled up the room,\
  \ then the house, and spilled out of the windows onto the streets below.\n\nIn the\
  \ kitchen, I locked eyes with Alex. He was tall and lean and had a head full of\
  \ messy, beautiful curls that fell about his face. There was something so paradoxical\
  \ about the way he held his body; he seemed confident and open yet totally unsure\
  \ of himself all at the same time. His playful eyes could see you clearly and certainly\
  \ tell you a few things you\u2019d surely love to hear.\n\nThe two of us stayed\
  \ in the kitchen, enjoying the food and the Florentine summer air. Small talk never\
  \ found its way into our words and I felt that intoxicating rush of newness and\
  \ depth. He opened up about losing his mom when he was very young and how it had\
  \ changed him and his family. He asked and really listened about my life and dreams\
  \ for the future.\n\nThe hours passed quickly and as the evening was coming to an\
  \ end, Alex stood close to me as the soft kitchen light shone down on his auburn\
  \ curls. He leaned down to kiss me, his hand ever-so-gently on my waist. \n\nIt\
  \ caught me off guard and I pulled back. I think I remember reaching up and touching\
  \ his face, telling him that I loved talking with him but didn\u2019t think we should\
  \ kiss.\n\nLater that night, I was in my bed listening to the constant, happy sounds\
  \ of the Piazza splashing up through my window. I lay restless, wondering about\
  \ that almost kiss. \n\nWe had talked about taking a walk through the city at night\
  \ and had made a plan to make it happen my last night in Florence. \n\nThe next\
  \ morning, my anticipation grew and my far-too-romantic-for-its-own-good imagination\
  \ ran away with thoughts of kissing him on the streets of my beloved Florence.\n\
  \nThat evening, my last, there was a terrible storm in the city with winds that\
  \ blew over giant trees and wreaked havoc on the ancient streets. The hope of that\
  \ kiss was extinguished when he was unable to drive into town on his motorbike.\n\
  \nThe next day, I left.\n\nTwo years later, by the bank of the Arno with the lights\
  \ of the Ponte Vecchio shining upon our faces, I got that kiss. And it was as glorious\
  \ and hot as Florence in the summertime. But that, my friends, is a story for another\
  \ time."
