Text: "I arrived at Pudu area at about 6:00 AM that morning. Kuala Lumpur was still\
  \ dark. Not many people around. The first thing that came crossed my mind is to\
  \ get to Bukit Bintang fast. With no taxi and avoiding the \u201Cafter clubbing\u201D\
  \ crowd, i walked towards Bukit Bintang area, where my supposed-to-be guesthouse\
  \ located. A bit scary though. But i was trying to be brave nonetheless.\n\nSince\
  \ it was too early to check in, i decided to stop by at nearest KFC. Just next to\
  \ the guesthouse building. Ordered a breakfast menu, sit and eat. The only entertainment\
  \ was a TV by the corner playing local TV3 channel. I took lots of coffee, since\
  \ i need to stay awake, at least until check in time. Suddenly i regret cancelling\
  \ my early booking a day before.\n\nI was supposed to be sleeping in nice bed by\
  \ that time. Booked a different guesthouse in the area before. But canceled it due\
  \ at the time, my KL friend said i can stay with her after my trip from Penang.\
  \ But she suddenly said she have something to do and i can only sty with her a day\
  \ after. \n\nSo\u2026.me with my own decision. Stranded in Bukit Bintang on early\
  \ morning. With a medium luggage, a sleepy head and a tired sore body.\n\nSitting\
  \ alone in KFC, watching the dark turned to light. Night turned to morning. People\
  \ starting to flood the street, doing their morning activity. Somehow it put me\
  \ to a perspective. Life is weird. And yet it is exciting. For no matter how dark\
  \ we faced, a light will always come in the end.\n\nAt about 9:00 AM, i started\
  \ to head for the guesthouse. The guesthouse was located in one of the building\
  \ in the corner of Bukit Bintang, famous area for shopping in KL. I had to dragged\
  \ my luggage to the 2nd floor where it\u2019s located. The guesthouse staff greeted\
  \ me. A bit rude though. Especially after he knew I\u2019m Indonesian. Don\u2019\
  t understand why. Then he said it was not yet check in time. Ok\u2026i know check\
  \ in time was at 12 noon at least. But i thought if there is a room available already,\
  \ they will let me check n early. And they didn\u2019t. They are quite strict about\
  \ it and kinda use a rude tone explaining it. I felt a bit offended. As if i didn\u2019\
  t pay a cent for the stay.\n\nBut, i was too tired to fight. So i left my luggage\
  \ at the counter and said i will be back. I went down again. And decided to get\
  \ more coffee. Sitting again with my sleepy eyes, next to a scary \u201Cblack guy\u201D\
  \ who keeps looking at me. Ugh :(. I felt so unsafe. And this is the first time\
  \ i felt so unsafe in KL after so many times coming here solo. He tried to start\
  \ a conversation, but i pretend i didn\u2019t speak English. I just didn\u2019t\
  \ want to be bother. Too tired, again.\n\nWas nearly 12 noon when i come back to\
  \ the guesthouse. About 30 minutes later my room was ready. I checked in, dropped\
  \ my luggage in the room and took a shower. Then get back to the small 3\xD73 meter\
  \ room with no window and took a nap.\n\nMy friend picked me up at the guesthouse\
  \ the next day. She then dropped me off to KL Sentral station where i took the airport\
  \ bus to KLIA2. We spend time to chat and had coffee. And time flies suddenly. The\
  \ road from KL Sentral to KLIA2 was a bit traffic that evening. And yes\u2026.i\
  \ was quite late arriving at airport.\n\nRunning fast to the check in booth and\
  \ collected my boarding pass. Running again to the immigration line. And damn\u2026\
  .what a queue! I heard the public announcement started to call for my flight to\
  \ board. Ow damn!! I was so scared to have missed it. Running again thru the boarding\
  \ lounge. And screaming for the ground staff not to close the door. Yes!! I was\
  \ the last to passed thru the door. \n\nBut then\u2026..i caught my flight in the\
  \ end. And safely home in few hours."
