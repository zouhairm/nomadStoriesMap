Text: "\u201CYou hate it already don\u2019t you?\u201D my sister Zulie asked prematurely\
  \ through the crackling phone connection, \u201Cbbbbe\u2026-honest\u201D.  Salim,\
  \ Zulie\u2019s friend, had picked me up at the Galkacyo landing strip in a patchy\
  \ white car the local\u2019s nicknamed \u2018soap box\u2019 because of its resemblance\
  \ to a bar of\u2026soap. He too was mirroring Zulie\u2019s expectant question through\
  \ raised eyebrows, wide eyes and a jittery demeanour anxious to hear a visitor\u2019\
  s compliment of his hometown.\nThe second flight from Mogadishu airport to Galkacyo\
  \ was in a small carpeted plane. A steward waved an incense urn in arcs, the trailing\
  \ smoke of frankincense and myrrh contradicting the musty smell of passengers past.\
  \ A pot-bellied Turkish pilot coughed down the aisle huffing on to the cockpit and\
  \ two hours of airplane ear and stomach churning turbulence ensued.\nIt was my first\
  \ time in Somalia, the land my parents spoke about in honeyed tones that you would\
  \ expect to gurgle out of a post-world war gramophone, the kind that graced the\
  \ era of my father\u2019s birth.\nA sense of deja-vu filled me up immediately and\
  \ I recognised something of the intimacy that my parent\u2019s guests from Somalia\
  \ to our home in Uganda would carry along with their news of the old homeland; deaths,\
  \ births, marriages and sweets that tasted of belonging to a past they refused to\
  \ accept was gone subtly infused in a menthol flavour.\nSomalia looked nothing like\
  \ Kenya or Uganda where I was raised. While dust storms battered the \u201Csoap\
  \ box\u201D and performed dervish swirls the entire length of the road to Garoowe,\
  \ Salim regaled me with stories of the Somalia he grew up in and the passengers\
  \ sitting in the back that he had picked up later threw in obscure details speaking\
  \ so animatedly that I soon lost track of the conversation and stayed silent so\
  \ as to not betray my broken Somali.\nI stared out the window instead at the skeletal\
  \ trees blooming with orange, red, blue polythene bags, goats ruminating on cud-\
  \ their rectangular pupils still, young men swishing khat in their bulging cheeks\
  \ crowding around scattered outdoor cafes to watch the evening news or football\
  \ and houses painted with water colours in a blurring rhythm of boxed patterns.\n\
  My arrival at Zulie\u2019s house in Garoowe was a heart-warming reunion that is\
  \ unique to long distance families. We even had cool diced sweet Somali grown watermelons\
  \ (that when whole looked pregnant in all their 5kg glory) on the airy verandah\
  \ outside and belly-laughed our way through gossip from back home in Uganda.\nA\
  \ week later Zulie got her work friends to take me for a trip up north to Qhardo,\
  \ an area known for pastoralism and unexpected lush fields of green with grazing\
  \ sheep that broke the monotony of the beige dry earth. I perked up every time I\
  \ saw wild animals native to Somalia like the solitary bush pig, a raucous congress\
  \ of baboons inspecting stones or exposing their backside to our car, there was\
  \ even a leering hyena that posed still one foreleg bent quite reminiscent of a\
  \ street dog up to no good that I laughed so distractedly I forgot the Somali names\
  \ for these beautiful animals.\nWe stopped at a camp of nomads searching for water\
  \ for their herds of camels, their houses folded atop camel humps in bunches of\
  \ tarpaulin, ragged cloth and sticks. They welcomed us and treated me with the civility\
  \ reserved for Somalis who have returned to the homeland. I understood why the camel\
  \ is a revered animal in Somali culture, its presence humbled me as it towered above\
  \ us with the elegance of resilience much akin to the Somali people. A camel herdess\
  \ raised my hand to stroke the nearest camel and encouraged me to take her for a\
  \ walk around the enclosure. As I stared into that one amber coloured eye of the\
  \ camel that was too kind to not mock me for not being Somali enough I was sure\
  \ Somalia was giving me a chance so I answered Zulie\u2019s question in my heart,\
  \ \u201CHow could I hate what I have loved for so long?\u201D"
