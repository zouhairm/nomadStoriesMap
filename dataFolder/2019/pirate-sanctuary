Text: "I told him it was time we gave up. It was Christmas day in a Catholic country.\
  \ It was asking for too much. \n\u201CI am not spending 10 days in Malta without\
  \ at least getting a glimpse of Comino. I have to see the blue lagoon for myself.\u201D\
  \n\u201CMaybe next time.\u201D \n\u201CNext time?!\u201D\nIt was true. There would\
  \ not be another Malta trip in the foreseeable future. At least not the future we\
  \ could imagine having. So we are doing this. We are already 2 hours into \u201C\
  doing this\u201D without success but that\u2019s beside the point. When S has that\
  \ look in his eyes, his mind was made up.\nAnother 15 minutes of walking along the\
  \ small port, lifting tarp (are we expecting to find someone waiting underneath?!)\
  \ and a guy approaches us, barely out of his teens, pale, blond-ish, lean, and asks\
  \ us if we want to go to Comino. He has a boat. We would have to go with another\
  \ family. 30 Euros per head. The price sounds outlandish but we jump at the chance.\
  \ \nIt was a small boat and the family with us had that larger-than-life, shiny,\
  \ Armani look. S, ever \"The Godfather\" fan, speculated that it was a mafia boss\
  \ going home for Christmas dinner with gifts for his family. When we arrived at\
  \ the island, a man in military fatigues came to pick them up in a Jeep. Maltese\
  \ political dynasty, maybe? We will satisfy our curiosity later. The island was\
  \ endless, dusty, dotted with rust and bronze shrubs. We walked toward our destination,\
  \ the fabled blue lagoon. We were the only people there that day and it was quiet\
  \ and hypnotic, the various shades of blue shimmering against the white lime, holding\
  \ us in a trance. I am a person who grew up in cities near the sea and I am not\
  \ a stranger to the peculiar pull of the water but this was different. It was a\
  \ lazy, languid sort of magic, inspired by the warmth and brilliance of the sun\
  \ and the perfect stillness of the waters, mesmerizing. We were told by our taxi\
  \ driver, Joe, the previous day, that there were cannons pointed towards it when\
  \ the Knights were ruling Malta, to discourage pirates. I understood the popularity\
  \ of the place with pirates and exiles: an oasis for the eternal nomad. \n Our Maltese\
  \ acquaintance, Rita of the large gestures and the flaming hair, mentioned that\
  \ Comino had only four permanent residents. The government had asked them repeatedly\
  \ to relocate to the mainland but they refused. Supplies and other essentials (including\
  \ religious counsel in the form of a priest) were ferried to them daily from nearby\
  \ Gozo.\nI was reminded of another place I discovered over tea one summer. My uncle\
  \ was posted as a bank manager in a remote village in the hills of south India.\
  \ There was a bus that went there daily across a tiny bridge and the same bus returned\
  \ in the evening. There were just a handful of permanent residents, all of them\
  \ elderly, all of them multi-millionaires, the money dutifully deposited by their\
  \ children who lived abroad. They were asked to join them but refused, preferring\
  \ that isolated, rain-drenched hill. What makes people cling to limestone rocks\
  \ and tropical hills so fiercely? I was a perpetual migrant, the child of migrants,\
  \ who learned early to anchor myself to people. The sense of establishing roots\
  \ in a place is alien to me, inscrutable. The aforementioned uncle, who recounted\
  \ the story, is a man who resisted promotions for years in order to avoid moving\
  \ away from his home town, a small hamlet verdant with canopies of nutmeg and rubber.\
  \ His colleagues forced him to take the job in the hills so that he could retire\
  \ as a manager. The name of the village was \"Seethathode.\" Legend has it that\
  \ Seetha from the Indian epic, Ramayana, requested to be swallowed by the earth\
  \ here rather than return to Ayodhya with Rama: I cannot think of a grander metaphor\
  \ for being rooted in a physical place. Looking at the lagoon, I recognize that\
  \ at least for now I am a pirate, here but fleetingly, seeking sanctuary."
