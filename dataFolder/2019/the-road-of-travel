Text: "The road of travel \nBy: Sara Ellaithy\n    I came back to Assuit after seven\
  \ months of absence I was closely to forget views of the road in it because I didn\u2019\
  t spend that long time in one place without traveling except the four years which\
  \ we spend it out of Egypt in Japan, since I was child I used to spend period of\
  \ study in Assuit and the vacation between Cairo and Alexandria and which one of\
  \ this not as long as seven months.\n    In last times we used to go to Cairo many\
  \ times since my brother went there to study engineering and in the same time I\
  \ finished my study of media in Assuit so I don\u2019t have to be there for special\
  \ times, and also after that my grandmother have cancer that make her don\u2019\
  t able to take care of my brother who stay with her, because all of that reasons\
  \ we have to spend that long time in Cairo.\n    Finally we decide to come back\
  \ to Assuit after we found a housekeeper to stay with my grandmother and take care\
  \ of her and my brother also, then we traveled by car as usual, even the car make\
  \ me enjoy by views out of it more than train specially after sundown when it\u2019\
  s become impossible to see anything out of train\u2019s windows, but I miss the\
  \ traveling by train so much, since my dad bay that car after we came back from\
  \ Japan in 2004 I didn\u2019t travel by train except one time when I went in girl\u2019\
  s tripe to Alexandria in high school.\n     I still remember in my childhood I was\
  \ so naughty, always I was fighting with my brother to set beside to window in train\
  \ to enjoy by watching views and farmers on the road, and in the night I was go\
  \ on all over the car of train which we stay in it and recognize of all passengers\
  \ and talk with them in several topics without faire or boring, and what was ban\
  \ me to go out of our car in train to other cars is my fear of moving floor between\
  \ cars.\n   I was afraid to go down from that moving floor and the train kills me\
  \ under its wheels. Now I came back to Assuit by mixed feelings between missed it\
  \ and desire of escape from it, that because Assuit is my birth place and I study\
  \ all my schools in it but also I can\u2019t see any professional future for me\
  \ in it, I always dream to live in Cairo and get job there in media and journalist.\n\
  \     Even the road to success in Cairo is so hard but at least there\u2019s the\
  \ road but here in Assuit there\u2019s no any roads, but also here In Assuit there\u2019\
  s all of my memories, the good of it or the bad, here\u2019s my private place that\
  \ nobody can take it from me, here\u2019s my best friends who I missed them every\
  \ time I travel in it, here I have memory in every place and every street.\n   \
  \ In Assuit there are all stories of my childhood and teenager and youth, here I\
  \ fall in love for the first time and also hurt my heart for the first time, here\
  \ is everything good and bad in same time, and I\u2019m loyal for my bad memories\
  \ as I miss my happy memories so that I always miss this city, as I far from it,\
  \ it pulls me again as dame companion my life and can\u2019t get rid of it or accept\
  \ it forever and forget my dreams."
