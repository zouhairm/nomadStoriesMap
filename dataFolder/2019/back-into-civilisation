Text: "As I got out of the car, I thanked the woman again who had picked me up in\
  \ the middle of nowhere, as I was walking along the highway all alone in the dark,\
  \ with nothing but a backpack and dirty clothes, and given me a lift back to Alice\
  \ Springs. I put my pack back on \u2013 so blissfully light now \u2013, closed the\
  \ door of the SUV, turned around and started walking towards the town centre, back\
  \ into civilisation.\n\nTwo weeks before, I had set out on a hike. I was going to\
  \ hike the Larapinta Trail, 225 km from Alice Springs westwards through the MacDonnell\
  \ Ranges. Only I was going to do it backwards, starting at the end of the last section\
  \ and walking back to the city. I had never done anything like this before. I had\
  \ actually only got the idea from a fellow traveller on a tour, who had just completed\
  \ the trail. Intrigued and full of romantic notions of self-discovery and adventure,\
  \ I thought if this sixty-something-year-old lady can do it, so can I. Less than\
  \ three weeks later, I found myself staggering towards the highway with a set of\
  \ trail maps and my brand-new 65L-backpack, trying to find a ride to Redbank Gorge,\
  \ the end of the trail and my starting point.\n\nA day later I started, without\
  \ any experience but full of expectations. It was a tough hike. After a day of walking\
  \ with my grossly heavy backpack, laden with food for a week and enough water to\
  \ get me through a day in the Australian outback, my whole body \u2013 shoulders,\
  \ back, hips, knees, even my toes \u2013 was constantly aching. The rock in the\
  \ West MacDonnell Ranges is extremely hard, often sharp, rough underfoot, taking\
  \ its toll on your shoes. And knees. And ankles. Endlessly walking up and down mountain\
  \ slopes, around spiky spinifex grass and thorny bushes, climbing rocks, walking\
  \ on jagged mountain crests, through grassland, making my way through dried-out\
  \ riverbeds, through gorges strewn with small pebbles and huge boulders. Sometimes\
  \ the gravel would give way under my feet. Once I slipped and fell, ending up sitting\
  \ on my bum with my legs hanging over the edge. The terrain is rough and rugged,\
  \ harsh and arid. But it's also gentle, peaceful, beautiful, and full of life. Despite\
  \ the aridity, there is life everywhere, defying the unfavourable conditions.\n\n\
  Every day the same struggles, the same thoughts circling through my mind, as relentless\
  \ as the sun burning down on me. But with every passing day, the thoughts and worries\
  \ were losing their power. And I became increasingly content with having only my\
  \ thoughts and the trail as company. I went from thinking, \"Why am I doing this?\"\
  , the first hour of hiking every morning, to not wanting the trail to end. I realized\
  \ that every time you lose motivation, that you're so tired and exhausted, standing\
  \ at the foot of the next slope to ascend, knowing there is always another one to\
  \ come, that whenever you think you can't go on, all you need to do is stop for\
  \ a moment, take a sip of water, breathe. Then you go on. Because you can. Whatever\
  \ you need to do, you always can.\n\nAfter thirteen days and nine and a half sections\
  \ on the Larapinta Trail, one pair of shorts, three shirts, one shower and zero\
  \ hair washes later, I arrived back in Alice Springs. As I made my way to a restaurant\
  \ to celebrate my return, acutely aware of how dirty my clothes were, I felt slightly\
  \ disoriented. Suddenly there was all this noise: people talking, traffic, loud\
  \ music. Slowly the realization that I was back in civilisation kicked in. At the\
  \ thought of to-do lists, plans, obligations, I felt a weight slowly settling on\
  \ my shoulders, and somehow it was more uncomfortable than the literal weight of\
  \ my pack. Despite everything you have to plan beforehand and all the things you\
  \ depend on out there, I had felt an unknown sense of freedom. I took the first\
  \ bite out of my burger, savouring the juicy beef, the melted cheese and the crunchy\
  \ lettuce, and mentally started to plan the next hike\u2026"
