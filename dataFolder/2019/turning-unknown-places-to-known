Text: "Bags packed and all checked in to my flight to Prague I could hardly believe\
  \ that all the pictures and photos I\u2019ve seen of this magical place is about\
  \ to turn into reality.\nThe sun was still trying to break though the clouds and\
  \ I stepped in this new and yes - magical place, one doesn\u2019t need to find a\
  \ place to click a perfect picture, everywhere my eyes went and they saw was registering\
  \ in my head like frames and stills and yet I couldn\u2019t take it all in.\nonce\
  \ in my hotel I cudnt wait to throw my backpack, dig out my camera and just run\
  \ out.. This was another surprise to me, as a girl on travel I generally look for\
  \ the time or a Map or crowd to start my trip but this time it was different, it\
  \ was a city whose currency I wasn\u2019t familiar with but still somehow felt Iam\
  \ exactly where Iam supposed to be. \nSo my sight seen began and every where I looked\
  \ was a breath to hold a memory to imprent, so many times I would click then look\
  \ up at the actual place then back to my camera image and delete it, nothing could\
  \ do justice to the beauty of this \u201CCity of a Hundred Spires,\u201D..\nBy night\
  \ fall I was back to my hotel bar and couldn\u2019t help but explain how beautiful\
  \ everything was to the girl behind the bar who was born and brought up there..\
  \ when she realized how excited I was she told me about this lady who takes you\
  \ on night tours of the city!!! I couldn\u2019t have let this go.. i saw the beauty\
  \ of the day light , I couldn\u2019t let the moonlight be taken away from me.. over\
  \ a bottle of rose wine I convinced the girl to connect me with the lady ( Mariea)\
  \ who was booked already so she asked me if I could go with her at midnight.. Could\
  \ I say no to that?\nBy mid night I met Mariea, so polite and humble.. and she was\
  \ sooo happy that someone loves here city so much they would rather walk all night\
  \ then to sleep and miss any moment of it.. our trip began and she took me to all\
  \ the old night shops, and pubs with horror stories, a church which was haunted,\
  \ a stree which still remains empty expecting the headless sailors to return for\
  \ his love.. i tried my best to make notes of it all and then the next moment I\
  \ was lost in another story... by the break of dawn we were tired and she asked\
  \ me if I would like coffee , so we bought coffee and sat on the footpath and I\
  \ kept telling her how fullfilling this entire journey was, that how its the small\
  \ places and the local streets that make a place and she smiled and said, \u201C\
  \ well this street isn\u2019t that small, after all we are sitting under Mozarts\
  \ house..\u201D\nAll I remember of that trip along with the locals, the buildings,\
  \ Churches, Fountains and so many different things is the window Under which I sat\
  \ so numb with a steaming hot cup of coffee reading what was weitten next to the\
  \ window for the first time, \u201C \nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart\nComposer..\u201D"
