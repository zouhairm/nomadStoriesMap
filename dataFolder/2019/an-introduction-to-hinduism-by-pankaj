Text: "We were in Rajasthan when I received an e-mail from my teacher with the final\
  \ words: \u201CPushkar is beautiful.\u201D That was all it took for us to change\
  \ our travel arrangements. Two days later we arrived to my first sacred place.\n\
  \n As my friend went shopping at a colorful and noisy street market, I decided to\
  \ go to the temple.\n While climbing the outdoor stairway leading to the main building,\
  \ I raised my eyes and found, at the top of the stairs, the figure of a tall, thin\
  \ Indian man with beautiful green eyes. He was looking right at me with a smile\
  \ on his face. He swiped his hands over his head to remind me that my head was not\
  \ covered, as it must be in all temples. I placed the pashmina over my head and\
  \ kept walking up the stairs to meet him at the temple\xB4s door. As he welcomed\
  \ me in a very proper English I noticed that he stuttered. My chest filled with\
  \ infinite tenderness while I listened to his introduction of what would be his\
  \ guidance through the temple. \nHis name was Pankaj. He called me Balaka.\n\n Stumbling\
  \ between one word and the next one, Pankaj explained that this temple was the only\
  \ one in all of India dedicated to Brahman, the God of Creation. Gayatri was supposed\
  \ to be the first woman Brahman married, his first wife. As he didn\xB4t keep his\
  \ promise, Gayatri decreed that Pushkar would be the only place where Brahman was\
  \ to be venerated. \n\nWe made our way to the first altar, dedicated to Ganesh.\
  \ Since he is the remover of obstacles, he is the first god in the temple one should\
  \ pray to.\n- Very good, noted - I said, my full attention on Pankaj\n- Well\u2026\
  \  - he replied. \nI looked at him with expectation. He finally ordered: \n- P-Pr-Pray\
  \ then!\n- Oh! Ok... Om gamganna Pataye Namaha - I prayed, with my palms together,\
  \ from the bottom of my heart. \n- I-In-Incomplete Mantra, b-ba-bad Karma - he told\
  \ me. \n- I don\xB4t know the complete mantra. \n- You learn.\n- Very well then\
  \ - I laughed, moved from the tenderness he inspired in me.\n\nIn the main room\
  \ there was a magnificent painting: Brahman and Gayatri at the center, Vishnu, the\
  \ Maintenance God, to their right side, and Shiva, the God of Destruction, to their\
  \ left. It was at this altar where the Gayatri mantra was to be recited. Perfect!\
  \ That one I knew in its entirety, no bad Karma this time. I prayed. \n\n- V-Ve-Very\
  \ good pr-pronunciation. Now, every day 108 r-re-repetition.\nWhat? 108 repetitions?\
  \ There was no easy way to please Pankaj. \n- Who do you p-pray to? - he asked.\
  \ \n- My heart is always with Shiva.\n- G-Goo-Good, let\xB4s take the flowers to\
  \ Sh-Shiva then. You smelled flowers?\n- Yes! Very sweet - I replied joyfully. \n\
  - Nooo!!! Y-You don\xB4t smell the f-fl-flowers you offer, you don\xB4t s-smell!\n\
  \ Of course Pankaj took me back to buy new flowers, with their scent intact for\
  \ Shiva.\n\n As our visit to the temple ended, we made our way to the lake for the\
  \ sacred walk around it. However, we first needed to pick up our shoes at the temple\u2019\
  s entrance. As I started looking for my sneakers, I placed the plastic bag containing\
  \ the Prasad on top of the shoe shelf. A shout interrupted my search. \n- Noooooo!!!\
  \ You d-do not put Prasad with sh-shoes! Is holy! \n- I\xB4m sorry! So sorry!\n\
  I quickly took the Prasad far away from where the evil Converses were.\n\nAs we\
  \ started our sacred walk by the lake, he asked if we ate animals in Mexico.\n -\
  \ We\u2019ll eat anything that moves- I said\n - B-bu-but God gives you everything!\n\
  \ God gives you rice\n God gives you f-fr-fruits and v-vegetables\n God gives you\
  \ chapatti\u2026.\n Why cut the cow?\n Why???\n\nThat was the sweetest vegetarian\
  \ argument anyone had ever thrown at me. We completed the walk around the lake as\
  \ the night was falling.\n\nOne afternoon with Pankaj had taught me more about yoga\
  \ and India than years of reading and studying this philosophy. \nI said goodbye\
  \ to Pankaj without him knowing that he would forever be staying in my memory. \n\
  I said goodbye to Pushkar without me knowing it would everlastingly stay in my heart."
