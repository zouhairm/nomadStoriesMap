Text: "I was raised in a Central California agricultural and ranching community that\
  \ was, for decades, the new homeland for Portuguese emrigants. This community is\
  \ my heritage. While we'd celebrate Portuguese holidays and culture, the details\
  \ of our community's history were always on the periphery of family discourse. For\
  \ most of my youth, I never questioned why and how so many Portuguese had made it\
  \ out to this remote and bucolic area of the world. I never really wondered who\
  \ we were and why it never seemed that important for me to know.\n\nIn these last\
  \ few years, some of my dearest relatives have passed. While the frequency of these\
  \ sorrowful events increases, I am likewise realizing that the opportunity to discover\
  \ who we are and who we were is diminishing as well.  I feel I might be allowing\
  \ a significant part of who I am and how I was raised to be forever interned to\
  \ silence. I wanted to know more about the ones I loved. \n\nAs of recently, I've\
  \ used some of my academic resources and training to research Portuguese emigrants\
  \ in California. Using scholastic methods of inquiry combined with the recollection\
  \ of my grandmother mentioning the Azores Islands and family members still living\
  \ in Portugal, I was able to develop a timeline and narrative of my family that\
  \ was weaved into the Azores Diaspora. Everything aligned down to the specific town\
  \ where I was raised and my family name. \n\nI also learned about the conditions\
  \ that may have fostered the silence, suppression, and capitulation of Azores culture\
  \ to become US citizens. Due to strict immigration laws, the Azores people were\
  \ forced to assimilate to a US culture, language, and agency in order to escape\
  \ the brutal landscape and poverty they faced on the Portuguese islands. \n\nThus,\
  \ all these details provide the foundation of yearning to know the Portuguese we\
  \ were before America. I need to travel to Portugal where I can link up with family\
  \ members who have stayed and explore what it is to be Portuguese. I want to illuminate\
  \ what has been kept in the dark. To see the Azores Islands, taste the food, learn\
  \ its language, and feel the vibrations of its motion, I'd absorb it all and from\
  \ there attempt to glean what's been missing from there.\n\nIt is then my desire,\
  \ to bring back what I've gained and share it with my remaining relatives. My hope\
  \ is that it will invite back in what has been hidden for so long, that stories\
  \ will emerge from their silent cages, and that maybe atonement for what's been\
  \ lost."
