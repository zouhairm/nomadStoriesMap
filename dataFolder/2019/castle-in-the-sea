Text: "On the western-most tip of France, about as far as you can go without crossing\
  \ the English Channel, lies a landscape more suited to Middle-Earth than the very\
  \ real shores of Brittany. You know you are close when everything starts to go pink:\
  \ pink stone houses, pink stone fences, pink stone curbs and sidewalks. Pink half-dressed\
  \ people, leaning out of their windows to chat with a neighbor on the sidewalk below.\
  \ Then comes the smell of the sea, salty and fresh, exciting and a bit bittersweet\
  \ if, like me, you grew up with the ocean and have since left her. \n\nThe water\
  \ that caresses the cliffs of Perros-Guirec is startlingly blue - a smoked teal\
  \ that sets off the pink-brown cliffs and boulders magnificently. The evergreens\
  \ have their say in the palette, too, as does the misty gray-blue sky. A feeling\
  \ of ancientness pervades the air here. The Celtic tribes that inhabited this coast\
  \ over two thousand years ago saw these same colors and breathed the same sea air.\
  \ \n\nPerros-Guirec is the crown jewel of the sentier des douaniers, or customs\
  \ officers' path, a 1,800 km hiking trail along the Breton coast. Built in 1791\
  \ to curtail smuggling, the trail is the border between land and sea around the\
  \ entire peninsula, from Mont St. Michel in the north to St. Nazaire in the south.\
  \ In the summers, french students on break hike pieces of it, exploring its beaches,\
  \ cliffs, and charming villages by the score. \n\nOn a drizzly morning in November,\
  \ however, I had the path to myself. I felt nearly giddy in the solitude of this\
  \ dream-scape, and I found myself running around corners to see what was next and\
  \ stopping, dumbstruck, at each new view. Forested sections that concealed large,\
  \ overgrown yards and a glimpse of pink-granite house gave way to round boulders\
  \ shaped by giants that cut the sea into kaleidoscope pieces. A great, pink castle\
  \ dwarfed the island on which it sat. An archaic-looking one room church sat insoluble\
  \ upon a hill, no path through the heather to penetrate its mystery. \n\nThe most\
  \ popular sight along the Pink Granite Coast is the Ploumanac'h lighthouse, which\
  \ crowns a sharp promontory past the church-like building. The lighthouse, which\
  \ is still active, is not open to the public, but the views from the surrounding\
  \ cliffs are just as stunning. My father says a person never gets bored staring\
  \ at either fire or the sea. Here, at Ploumanac'h, I felt he was right."
