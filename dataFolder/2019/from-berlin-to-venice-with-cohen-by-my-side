Text: "We met in Berlin, I remember it well. I had known about you before then, but\
  \ that was when I entered your radar in all of its sunlight and poetic glory, on\
  \ that warm March morning. I had received a call from a friend telling me you'd\
  \ be in town in a few months. The blissful excitement and joy of finally being in\
  \ the same room as you overcame me. \n\nYou made your presence clear many times\
  \ on our journey together. You took the form of many different men, never leaving\
  \ my side. \nI remember that afternoon I came home from listening to a man play\
  \ the piano out by the river, right beside the bridge. He had a carefully placed\
  \ glass of red wine on top of his piano, just like I imagine you would have. \n\n\
  I drew him, and purposefully made sure he resembled you, my love. \n\nThat afternoon\
  \ you shone in from the window with the light of the sun and she was putting the\
  \ laundry away while your voice trembled through the hallway, meeting me at the\
  \ door. \n\nYou inhabited a part of every lover I had during those five months.\
  \ You traveled with me through the cold and warm and accompanied me at the train\
  \ stations, on bridges where we met, bedrooms and rainy nights on the back of a\
  \ stranger\u2019s bicycle. You smoked the many cigarettes I lit, and tasted the\
  \ wine we drank together as we \u2018danced to the end of love\u2019. \n\nI would\
  \ lay in bed with them and they all spoke of your words that slipped out of you\
  \ into our souls. Every lover had a story you told me\u2026 \n\nThe story of one\
  \ of the men you led me to was in Venice, where I recall dancing barefoot in St.\
  \ Marco Square at 5 am, where the pigeons and seagulls spread their wings protecting\
  \ their history from the unknown strangers. \n\nWith this man I did not share a\
  \ bed. No, it wasn\u2019t like that. We connected like siblings do, lamenting the\
  \ past we never knew we missed out on sharing. \nThis man called himself the Cashman.\
  \ \n\nThe one night, being the wild child that I am, the Cashman and I ran off.\
  \ It was a full moon and we were set on going to Lido to swim nude under the moonlight.\
  \ Unwittingly, we collected strangers who saw the lambent light within us and wanted\
  \ to share this assembly of freedom as we danced and laughed down the moonlit canal.\
  \ \n\nThe Cashman would always talk about the connection everyone had with the sun\
  \ and the moon and how Venice was like a map connecting the male and female energies.\
  \ \u201CThe bridges,\u201D he would always say.  \u201CThe bridges connect us all.\u201D\
  \ \n\nSuddenly there were thirty of us making our way on to a ferry with a bag of\
  \ beer a kind stranger gifted us with, before disappearing into the night. \nEveryone\
  \ was giggling, except for the man asking for our tickets. We offered him beer and\
  \ cigarettes in exchange for the loosening grip of his stern demeanor. After a seemingly\
  \ long moment of consideration he accepted and sat with us, one leg crossed over\
  \ the other. \n\nHe hunched over as he lit his cigarette, making sure the wind didn\u2019\
  t drive the flame away. After a few slow and drawn-out drags he turned to me and\
  \ asked; \u201CWant to drive the vaporetto?\u201D \n\nMoments later I was standing\
  \ by an increasingly displeased captain who kept insisting the boat be steered in\
  \ a straight line. This request put a damper on my \u2018not so linear\u2019 travel\
  \ plans. After overcoming my maniacal bliss, we got away, and ran into the arms\
  \ of delight and excitement.  \n\nAway to the beach, with the full moon above us,\
  \ as we splashed and laughed like unrestricted children, running into the sea with\
  \ our naked bodies exposed for the sky to muse. \n\nThe Cashman and I smiled at\
  \ each other. \n\nIn that moment I thought of you, my love, as your voice and Suzanne\
  \ escorted me once again\u2026 \n\n\u201CAnd you want to travel with her, and you\
  \ want to travel blind\u2026.\u201D"
