Text: "Ubud, Bali. I wander through the narrow streets, like the cats and dogs of\
  \ each breed and even more half-breeds. A light breeze of lotus and sandalwood is\
  \ hanging in the air when I walk past the Balinese temples with shrines behind the\
  \ elaborately decorated, golden gates. Next to locally owned restaurants, which\
  \ bear the word \xB4Warung\xB4, are shops full of different fabrics in all colours.\
  \ Whilst being hassled to buy sarongs, scarfs and dresses, humidity is wrapped around\
  \ me like a too warm blanket. In the background the sound of honking cars and motorbikes.\
  \ \n\nWith a never ending bucket list, including Tanah Lot Temple, Tegallalang Rice\
  \ Terraces, Monkey Forest and much more, I end up in front of a tourist information\
  \ to book a trip to Mount Batur for the next day. \u201CTomorrow no tour. Tomorrow\
  \ Nyepi!\u201D After some investigation I determine that Nyepi is the Balinese New\
  \ Year and day of silence. Everything in Bali is closed for one day - even the airport\
  \ is shut down. It\xB4s a Hindu festival to cleanse body, mind and soul through\
  \ fasting, meditation and self-reflection. To avoid any form of distraction, electricity,\
  \ work, entertainment and traveling are restricted. Instead of ticking a point from\
  \ my bucket list, nothing else remains but to wait with my trip for the day after\
  \ Nyepi. \n\nIn the evening I find myself standing in the streets, in a crowd of\
  \ countless raincoats and umbrellas. Something is going on. Soaked from sweat and\
  \ rain, not entirely sure what to expect, I wait in joyful anticipation. Eventually\
  \ a loud voice blares out of the speaker right behind me and welcomes everyone to\
  \ Ogoh-Ogoh Parade. In the distance I spot a giant statue coming towards me, in\
  \ the shape of Ganesha, the Hindu God of new beginnings, success and wisdom. Sails\
  \ are attached on his back, which makes him look like a sailboat. With the sound\
  \ of the sea in the background, Ganesha sails through an ocean full of colourful\
  \ fish, jellyfish, rays and algae, all made of recycled material. The voice coming\
  \ out of the speaker, still loud but less distorted, draws attention to all the\
  \ plastic in the sea and raises awareness to our responsibility for a positive change.\
  \ Accompanied by traditional music the next Ogoh-Ogoh\xB4s are either formed like\
  \ Hindu Gods or demonic mythological creatures. As I figure out later, they capture\
  \ the bad spirits and are going to be beheaded or burned after the parade. That\
  \ symbolizes self-purification from our inner and outer demons.\n\nOn the following\
  \ day I wake to an eerie silence. The familiar sounds of cars, motorbikes and street\
  \ life replaced by the crow of a cock in the distance. I didn\xB4t expect to find\
  \ such serenity. Even tourists are required to remain in their accommodation. No\
  \ one wants to risk, to attract attention of any left bad spirits. After arriving\
  \ in Ubud and being overwhelmed by all those impressions, this represents a welcome\
  \ change in my agenda. \n\n\u201CWhile some people consider Nyepi as a time for\
  \ relaxation and contemplation, others see it as a chance for Mother Earth to recover\
  \ from 364 days of human impact.\u201D I\xB4ve been told before. Passing in revue\
  \ the image of Ganesha, sailing through the ocean of plastic, I start thinking about\
  \ my contribution to a positive change through a sustainable way of travelling.\
  \ I\xB4m already used to refilling my own bottle with drinking water, instead of\
  \ purchasing the next plastic bottle. In the long term I consider to invest additionally\
  \ in a water filtration system. \n\nNyepi makes me appreciate slowing down, instead\
  \ of rushing from one tourist attraction to the next. There\xB4re no feelings of\
  \ missing out on anything or having to tick a point of my bucket list. Looking back\
  \ to the Ogoh-Ogoh Parade last night I recognize, the best experiences I\xB4ve whilst\
  \ travelling aren\xB4t on my bucket list at all. The most memorable moments, if\
  \ events or social interactions, just appear by fortunate coincidence, when being\
  \ to the right time in the right place. They are unique and nothing compared to\
  \ mass tourism. \n\nThen I lean back, just be in the present moment and fully enjoy\
  \ the sound of silence."
