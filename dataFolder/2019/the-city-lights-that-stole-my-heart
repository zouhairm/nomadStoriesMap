Text: "Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201CWelcome to New York\u201D is blasting in my ears\
  \ through the little white ear pods dangling from my ear notch as the aircraft start\
  \ to descent, bringing some home, taking some on vacation or to help an 18-year-old\
  \ make her childhood dream a reality. I stare down at the green passport in my hands,\
  \ this is it I think to myself with the biggest smile on my face after 23 hours\
  \ in transit, the time is finally here.\n\nThe moment my feet connects with the\
  \ soil of this beautiful city in America, all my fear and anxiety of being alone\
  \ in a place that I don\u2019t know drains out of my body, I take a deep breath\
  \ of the icy cold air and let it swirl around in my lungs for a bit, really taking\
  \ it all in, I let the air escape my body, with a tons of excitement I grab my hard\
  \ case bag and take it over to the Uber car waiting for me.\n\nThe journey from\
  \ JFK to central park seems very short my eyes focused on the sun that\u2019s starting\
  \ to hide behind the tall buildings. As we near the bridge to enter the island the\
  \ sun had completely left and the city lights up from within, arriving at Astor\
  \ Hotel on Central park I quickly check in with the friendly staff, drop my bags\
  \ in my room and run to the nearest subway station ready to tick Time square and\
  \ a big New York slice pizza off of my wish list, after struggling to figure out\
  \ how the subway works and sharing laughs with strangers I get to a staircase that\
  \ will forever change my life as I\u2019m climbing the stairs one at a time the\
  \ footsteps seem to disappear, the chatter fades away as I twirl in awe trying to\
  \ take in this magnificent beauty around me, I burst out in laughter feeling like\
  \ the only person in this city, the rumbling in my tummy draws me back to the here\
  \ and now and with a spring in my step I walk over to the closest pizzeria to get\
  \ myself a mouthwatering slice, and trust me it was amazing! \n\nMy alarm wakes\
  \ my early the next morning and I get ready in record time to tick off more things\
  \ from my wish list. I skip down the stairs hail a traditional yellow cab and make\
  \ my way to the Starbucks on 24 State street to meet up with my tour group from\
  \ GetYourGuide ready to explore the beauty and learn all about the Statue of Liberty,\
  \ Ellis Island and the 911, I never thought it could get better than this but when\
  \ I stepped out of the cab the skies opened up and the most perfect snowflakes started\
  \ making this already perfect city even more beautiful. \n\nOf course the next day\
  \ I had to what every girl loves to do, I had to explore a few stores, you know\
  \ for economic educational reasons. And to get the perfect outfit to end yet another\
  \ wonderful day on the top of the rock staring from a high view point at the snow\
  \ covered place that stole my heart over the past three days. \n\nDay four was not\
  \ as happy waking up as the other days just because I knew that this was the day\
  \ I had to say goodbye to this wonderful place, but I was determined to make my\
  \ last few hours as memorable as the rest of my trip, once again I took the subway\
  \ but this time to Chelsea to explore the market and give my artsy self some satisfaction\
  \ browsing through art galleries.\n\nThis place, the architecture, atmosphere, the\
  \ people, food, the adventure and everything I got to experience was too good to\
  \ be true. See you soon New York I say as I step into the airplane to the next destination\
  \ of my journey that awaits."
