Text: "My flight is fifteen minutes away and I just woke up, I dress in the furthest\
  \ form of flamboyant, a dark grey jacket, a sweatshirt and my faded jeans. My blond\
  \ hair tied in a ponytail, a bit of mascara, a swerve of lipstick, with an off course\
  \ skew that can be performed by a football player to help a fellow player stand\
  \ on his ground post falling on the field, I grab my backpack and leave the hotel\
  \ room. I check out and rent a taxi. With indecipherable rush of the words 'quick,\
  \ please, hurry, now, airport' I ask the cap driver to get me as fast as possible\
  \ to Heathrow airport. No, I'm not British, I'm an American citizen with Libyan\
  \ roots, but what I am doing in London is five seconds away to be answered. I'm\
  \ a culturalist. Yes, that exists and I will explain it within two minutes. \nI've\
  \ wanted to be a culturalist ever since we have been exiled to the States because\
  \ my dad being an American and living in Libya among terrorists wasn't received\
  \ well with the American embassy, It was hard for mom though because she is half\
  \ Libyan, to get away from the people who raised you, the people you were brought\
  \ up with, from all your family, the house where you spent your childhood, your\
  \ neighbors, your friends, the schools you have been to, the shops you liked the\
  \ most, the streets you wandered in, it is like taking something off your body,\
  \ tug at your veins as if you're taking a slice of pizza saturated with mozzarella\
  \ from where it was attached.\nA culturalist is a person who spends most of her\
  \ (the feminist thing yeah) life on a plane, in a car, on a boat or a train, who\
  \ wanders in different cities for a week, it can be longer if you liked but I've\
  \ had a rule to never prolong my residence in any place, it is for the same reason\
  \ that this rule was broken. To never get attached. \nBeing a culturalist and learning\
  \ so many different things about different people and diving into the cultures of\
  \ different cities had taught me to never be judgmental, you will be utterly surprised\
  \ of the reasons why people did specific things, for what might seem peculiar to\
  \ you is quite the opposite for them, actually you finding it odd is peculiar to\
  \ them. \nThe haze of the London sunrise stops my pen mid air and with a swallow,\
  \ I look at the window and the breathtaking sky is the whitest I've ever seen. There\
  \ is no light blue or turquoise or any other shade of blue. It is white and a bit\
  \ grey. It is literally breathtaking. We are really flying. I have seen it before\
  \ too many times actually but my favorite bit is when we sink, the sky is all different\
  \ sorts of colors. It is light blue, turquoise, grey, white. And sometimes it is\
  \ even tangerine if we are flying at sunset. It is rose when we are driving at sunset.\
  \ The view is indescribably beautiful. As if you are drawing a rainbow by moving\
  \ too fast. As if you're the controller of it. You feel in control and everything\
  \ is in your hands and how powerful the sense of domination is, the ability to do\
  \ anything just by looking at the colors merge and de-merge."
