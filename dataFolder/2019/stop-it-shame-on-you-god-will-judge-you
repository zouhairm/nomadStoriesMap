Text: "Almost a year later, and I still have an audio file labelled \"Stop it, shame\
  \ on you, God will judge you\" in my phone. If I were to press the play button,\
  \ a clear female voice will tell you in, I presume, accented Moroccan Arabic, something\
  \ along the lines of that title. Seven seconds long, full of raspy 'kh' sounds from\
  \ the throat, and sibilant s-es softening the ends of words, with cutlery clinking\
  \ in the background.  Her name is Coco, and I met her while I was having dinner\
  \ for one in Chefchaouen, the famed Blue City in Morocco's Rif Montains. I wouldn't\
  \ fully realize this until later, but our serendipitous meeting spawned new little\
  \ joys and unexpected side-trips in my Moroccan adventures. \n It was nearing the\
  \ end of my second day here in the country, on my first solo international trip.\
  \ I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I struggled to go out and eat dinner by myself.\
  \ Dinner seems more intimate than breakfast or lunch, doesn't it? Families settling\
  \ down for the day, dark and light giving an illusion of something private, and\
  \ me, feeling a bit lonely already. In the end, my love of food, the desire to redeem\
  \ that morning's goat tagine, and hunger pangs defeated any self-consciousness that\
  \ I harboured. \nAfter many wayward turns, warily and gratefully following a stranger\
  \ into the wrong Bab Ssour, and then following a blunt, kind lady to the correct\
  \ one, I finally made it to Bab Ssour, heavily reviewed, highly rated, and pretty\
  \ well hidden.  I took up a whole table by myself, the dying light of the setting\
  \ sun illuminating slices of the blue and white striped pattern of the tablecloth\
  \ wrapped in plastic. The terrace was full, but I still got a the second-highest\
  \ floor, and a great view of the blue, white, and clay-red roofs of homes and the\
  \ slant of the lush mountains. The small, cozy room steadily started filling up,\
  \ as I waited for my fish pastilla, sipping on refreshing, freshly squeezed orange\
  \ juice. Straight ahead, a large group had shuffled in, clearly friends. Their laughter\
  \ and easy camaraderie made me feel  aware of being alone again. The evening call\
  \ to prayer began, and the undulating voice of the muezzin mesmerized me. My frazzled\
  \ waiter, running back and forth, words flying speedily from his mouth, rushed pass\
  \ my table to welcome another large group. I turned to my right to see a blonde\
  \ girl sitting by herself, also eyeing the new group coming in. We were both aware\
  \ of the rapidly dwindling number of tables. Our eyes met, and after a pause I smiled.\
  \ \"Do you want to have dinner with me?\" I asked her, and that was that. \nI learned\
  \ that Coco is German, and had been travelling Morocco solo for a month already.\
  \ We spoke about the refugee crisis in Syria and what our respective countries were\
  \ doing about it. She regaled me with stories about her experience in the ergs of\
  \ the Sahara, and her Moroccan romance. As the night went on, customers steadily\
  \ cleared out, until we were one of two groups remaining on this floor. Abdul came\
  \ by and laid out a tray of cups, tea, and sweets with what I'm rapidly recognizing\
  \ as Moroccan hospitality.  I asked her if she ever got harassed by Moroccan men.\
  \ Not really, she told me, but if she did, she'd say this. Cue the recording of\
  \ 'Stop it, shame on you, God will judge you, ' in Arabic, learned from her Moroccan\
  \ flame. We laughed a lot, and had spectacular fun. My evening turned out to be\
  \ truly delightful, thanks to meeting her. She told me about the excursion up to\
  \ the Rif Mountains early next morning, led by her hostel coordinator, which I did\
  \ join. She told me about a secret garden in Marrakesh which I eventually took sanctuary\
  \ in from the polluted, hectic streets of the medina, and where to try very delicious\
  \ camel burgers. In the midst of my lonely self-doubts on my first solo trip, she\
  \ brightened my life, and I will always remember it. And no, I didn't have to use\
  \ that recording."
