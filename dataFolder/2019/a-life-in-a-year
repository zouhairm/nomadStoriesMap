Text: "Dreams. Everybody has own dreams.  Only 6 letters, but it has such a deep meaning.\
  \ My dream was to discover the world since I was 3\xAD-years old. This dream has\
  \ been motivating me for years, and I decided to let itcome true . I took part in\
  \ FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange) program. Winning this scholarship going to the\
  \ USA for a year helped me a lot because it\u2019s an opportunity to be an exchange\
  \ student in another country and a proud representative of Kazakhstan. I would never\
  \ imagine that once i will be ever gotten such chance. When i was boarding the plane,\
  \ my hands started shaking, i felt very cold and tried to hold my breath tight.\
  \ This feeling when you are on the plane to your dream and going forwards to have\
  \ the most memorable year in your life... these feelings... i would give anything\
  \ to feel them over and over again.  Since I was there, I have gotten a huge experience\
  \ that helped to find new friends, learn another culture, and live in a real American\
  \ family. Many events such as IEW (International Education Week) doing presentations\
  \ in my American High school. Everybody was very interested in discovering something\
  \ new to them from real people from quite different place with habits, traditions,\
  \ and lifestyles. I found out that each country and nation has its own cultures,\
  \ traditions, and places to go to and discover somethings new. To be honest, I am\
  \ not going to stop because being an exchange student in the USA gave me a big hope\
  \ that I can do more because I will try to learn the world and teach other people\
  \ about languages and other cultures. It\u2019s very hard to go somewhere abroad\
  \ away from own country for a girl from a small city of Kazakhstan and make very\
  \ big plans. Catching chances and using them wisely are main keys to achieve anything\
  \ in this life so I am catching this wonderful opportunity to make steps to future.\
  \  Our life is moving on, and the world is open to learn new things. We all must\
  \ truly live your life fully to have it in each year differently and fulfilled."
