Text: "Upon arrival, I along with a handful of travellers were greeted with what felt\
  \ like the absence of the sun's ozone layer, because the UV rays were so powerful\
  \ that it hurt my exposed skin. That day, I felt for those that didn't have a base\
  \ of melanin in them like I did.\nThat's the first thing I remember when crossing\
  \ the Laos-Cambodian border to get to my final destination\xAD\u200A-\u200ADon Det\u200A\
  -\u200Aan island in the middle of the Mekong River in Laos, made up of tiny villages.\n\
  \nThe village where I stayed reminded me so much of my mom's village in Punjab\xAD\
  \u2013no internet, no electricity and no western sewage system. You were never more\
  \ than three feet away from wild chickens, bunnies, kids, geckos, stray dogs and\
  \ so many species of bugs. Not only were locals able to have an intimate relationship\
  \ with nature here, but nature was able to interact with itself without any concrete\
  \ distractions.\n\nKeen to explore the village, my friend Sarika and I started on\
  \ a sweaty descent through the rice fields and dirt roads. Back then, exploring\
  \ had to be done when the sun was out, because once the sun set, there was a small\
  \ window of twilight before night time hit and everything was pitch black. Artificial\
  \ light was non-existent.\n\nI didn't intent to fall into a natural whirlpool that\
  \ day, I just wanted to dip my feet into the crystal blue water in hopes that it\
  \ would cool down the rest of my burning body. The swirl of water was so small,\
  \ so innocent, so inviting. Looking back, it was more of a mini vortex, yet big\
  \ enough to swallow my 100-pound body with ease. It felt nice, until the alarm went\
  \ off in my head and I saw Sarika reach out her arm, as far as her body allowed,\
  \ gripping a branch, hoping that I would latch on. I'd like to think it was my survival-mode,\
  \ super strength that pushed me out, but let's be honest, the force of the vortex\
  \ had died down.\nAlong with being soaked head to toe, so was my Nikon. Walking\
  \ back to the guest house, I left my wet mark on the dirt road with every sad step\
  \ I took. I was sobbing because a year's worth of previous travel memories stored\
  \ on that sd card were now all gone.\n\nThe owner of my guest house saw the tears.\
  \ I couldn't explain to him what had just happened with words because we didn't\
  \ speak the same language. However, we were able to communicate through show-and-tell.\
  \ I showed him my dampened camera and he took it with him. I said nothing. I saw\
  \ this man gently wrap cotton around a slender, tapered peice of wood he smoothed\
  \ out in front of me. He carefully nudged the DIY Q-Tip into the crevices of my\
  \ camera, soaking up the access water. He then skillfully took apart the camera,\
  \ with what looked like handmade tools, laying its parts out on a sheet to dry in\
  \ the shade. Once dried, he put everything back in its place and my camera worked\
  \ flawlessly. This man was the Laotian Macgyver.\n\nHe wanted nothing from me in\
  \ return, not even my money. I was so grateful, I hope he knew how much. We sat\
  \ there silent, looking at the calm countryside panorama laid out in front of us.\
  \ I'd like to believe we had some telepathic connection in that moment. We knew\
  \ this secret oasis wouldn't stay a secret for too much longer. This was 15 years\
  \ old ago.\n\nToday, Don Det has become a magnet for thirsty backpackers chasing\
  \ cannabis and coitus, partying until they zone out and very little can be done\
  \ about it. This island has lost its innocence and traditional culture. This is\
  \ an example of how things can go terribly wrong. The trade-off for global tourism\
  \ cannot be the loss of preserving both nature and the soul the Laotian villagers.\
  \ There has to be another way. I can only hope that the next time I visit my mom's\
  \ village in Punjab, nature will still outnumber locals, as it once did in Don Det."
