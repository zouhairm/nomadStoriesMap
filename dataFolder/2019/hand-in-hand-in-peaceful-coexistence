Text: "As I traveled throughout Jerusalem in the spring of 2016, a bustling city that\
  \ is often rife with political and religious tensions, I did not expect to find\
  \ an oasis for peaceful coexistence when I stepped inside the \"Max Rayne Hand in\
  \ Hand Jerusalem School\", a bilingual school set up in 1998 to foster mutual respect\
  \ and understanding between Israelis and Palestinians. \nTucked between the neighborhoods\
  \ of Beit Tsafafa and Pat, the school is a sort of  experiment lab that seeks to\
  \ pioneer a curriculum based on diversity, multiculturalism, and tolerance, as it\
  \ continues to draw international attention and praise.  Students from the school\
  \ were invited to the White House in 2014  by then president Barack Obama to celebrate\
  \ Hanukkah. \nThere, students from Jewish and Arab neighborhoods and diverse ethnic\
  \ backgrounds learn together in a classroom taught in Hebrew and Arabic -at least\
  \ in the lower grades-, gather under olive trees to share a meal, or play games,\
  \ as their giggles echo through the busy schoolyard. \nIt\xB4s the kind of peaceful\
  \ environment that Israelis have been hoping for for decades. Kids are resilient,\
  \ indeed, but some of the hand-made crayon drawings and paintings I saw hanging\
  \ on the walls left no doubt that the ongoing regional violence has already impacted\
  \ their young lives.  Unlike most American kids, who only see violence on TV or\
  \ in poor, drug-infested neighborhoods, officials told me that students at this\
  \ school often share their experiences and fears about army raids or terror attacks.\
  \ But they do so with proper guidance from their teachers. \nOne drawing, made on\
  \ a green construction paper, showcased a bronze bullet under the word \"quick\"\
  , and right beneath it, a lit cigarette with the word \"slow\", clearly depicting\
  \ two ways to die. That drawing, simple yet poignant, still forms a lump in my throat\
  \ every time I remember it.  I was shaken out of my inner sadness by the gentle\
  \ tug of young girl\xB4s hand who invited me to sit with her in one of the hallways.\
  \ Clad in a blue t-shirt,  she stared at me with deep hazel eyes behind hot-pink\
  \ eyeglasses, smiling as she described the matching- colored barrette shaped in\
  \ a butterfly. She told me she liked the school because she made new friends and\
  \ learned a lot from her Arab school mates. \nStudents like her are assimilating\
  \ the school model, based on promoting inclusiveness, respect,  equality, and coexistence.\
  \  The school began in 1998 with some 20 students in a makeshift classroom, and\
  \ that number grew to more than 1400 when I visited in 2016. A recent Knesset study\
  \ showed that joint schools like the ones run by \"Hand in Hand\" have grown in\
  \ popularity throughout Israel,  with a 60% increase in enrollment over the last\
  \ five years. This school year some 1,700 students have enrolled in bilingual schools,\
  \ even though the government doesn't allocate resources specifically for them. \n\
  Back at the school, I remember the students huddling around me and other reporters\
  \ at the time, posing and smiling wide for the cameras in front of rows of desks,\
  \  dusting chalk off their hands before embracing each other by the waist. \nAt\
  \ this school, students, teachers, and parents witness not only the blossoming of\
  \ friendship but also the seedlings of a hopeful tomorrow in the Middle East, based\
  \ on a dialogue of peace, starting at a very young age. I had not expected to find\
  \ that oasis behind the walls of the \"Hand in Hand\" school building in Jerusalem."
