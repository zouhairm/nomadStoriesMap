Text: "There will be so many countries, cities and places that you will visit in your\
  \ lifetime. And there will be as many or even more unique experiences, unexpected\
  \ occurrences, and breathtaking views. But despite all these wonderment, nothing\
  \ can ever compares to the feeling of connection you get with a country. You can\
  \ travel and visit a country and have an enjoyable time there but yet, has no strong\
  \ desire to come back again. But this connection is different. It is the feeling\
  \ where you have just stepped out of the airport; you breathed in and felt your\
  \ heart is at peace, like as if you are home \u2013 even in a place you have never\
  \ been before. And right then, and there, as you opened you eyes, you were immediately\
  \ pulled down into its land. And you know, your feelings have been pulled into it\
  \ as well. No matter how many times you come back, you know that this will never\
  \ be the last time. And for me, that country is Japan. \n\nJapan has a way in beautifying\
  \ words, descriptions and stories about themselves. But when you get to know them\
  \ better, you start peeling off their skin, and you realise that this freshly sweet\
  \ orange is actually a sour plum. The people of Japan always appear to be the most\
  \ respectful and mannered citizens I have ever met \u2013 The way they will bow\
  \ to apologise to you for their inability to assist you, helping you to carry your\
  \ heavy luggage up and down the stairs, to even giving you a lift to the station\
  \ in times of heavy rain. But, despite all these praises, I have got to say, Japanese\
  \ people has got to be one of the most intriguing and unorthodox people I have ever\
  \ met. And yes, I got to know more about them through the interviews I have done\
  \ when I was in Japan, Tokyo, studying Journalism. \n\nJapan is one of the few countries\
  \ where you get to taste both traditional and modern flavours. Travel to its rural\
  \ cities like Matsuyama, home to the famous author, Natsumi Soseki, to be immersed\
  \ in the traditional Japan. You get to experience Onsen houses like the one in Ghibli\u2019\
  s Spirited Away and enjoy riding a bicycle in a quaint neighbourhood similar to\
  \ Doraemon. At midnight, you can even go to a nearby Ramen stall for a bowl of hot\
  \ steaming Ramen like Naruto. Or travel to its busiest and most modern city, Tokyo,\
  \ where you will be confused and lost by its complicated subway lines and the bustling\
  \ of people day and night. Travel in their subways in the morning to experience\
  \ getting squeezed to the point were your feet couldn't even touch the ground, or\
  \ visit Harajuku and be a part of its cosplay scene. You can finally unleash your\
  \ creativity and inner childhood dream of being someone that you have always wanted\
  \ to be.  \n\nThe people are just the same. The strong influence of its traditional\
  \ culture creates rules and boundaries \u2013 their manners, behaviours and actions.\
  \ And yet, the introduction of a modern society through globalisation influences\
  \ their way of thoughts, concept and impressions. This discrepancy led the suppression\
  \ of one\u2019s belief. Some are proud in the change and has no qualms in showing\
  \ their differences, no matter the negative responses received. In fact, they might\
  \ actually savour that little moment of fame. However, most will keep it hidden.\
  \ And this is where the twist comes. For these people, containing them allow their\
  \ dark sides to appear. And that's how the infamous twisted and dark stories of\
  \ Japanese people come about. \n\nJapanese people have this talent of upholding\
  \ their appearance to not bring shame to their family name while having multiple\
  \ curious thoughts that will be unthinkable to most. And the experiences I had interviewing\
  \ and researching allows me to understand the connection I have formed \u2013 Its\
  \ people. A country is made up of its people; and its people made up its culture.\
  \ And to have that deep connection with the people, means having the connection\
  \ to the culture. It is this sense of lure and yet familiarity that made me visits\
  \ this place again and again."
