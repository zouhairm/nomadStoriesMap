Text: "It's 2000, and I'm watching a popular travel show hosted by a petite brunette\
  \ with sparkling teeth on my boxy television. Every week, the host would pose exuberantly\
  \ against glamorous international backdrops. Now she is at Spain's Tomatina Festival,\
  \ carefree and laughing, as plump tomatoes are volleyed behind her in a quaint square.\
  \ I didn't yet have a succinct acronym to describe my emotional state, but my body\
  \ vibrated with pure FOMO*\n\n8 years later, it is just after sunrise on an already\
  \ muggy August day, and I'm in Bu\xF1ol, Spain, the minuscule town where thousands\
  \ gather every year to hurl tomatoes at each other. The festival of Tomatina originated\
  \ from a street quarrel in 1945, when people resorted to ransacking a vegetable\
  \ stand for arms. The tradition continues to today. It's meant to be fun. I'm part\
  \ of a horde of invaders who have just arrived on the local train from Valencia\
  \ and are marching purposefully up the dusty street into town. Many townspeople\
  \ have covered their homes with plastic tarps or boards in preparation for the event.\
  \ Most of the locals are of retirement age and have chosen to barricade themselves\
  \ inside bars or homes. Other enterprising types have set up roadside stands to\
  \ sell barbecued pork and beer, while a few seem to enjoy the merriment, leaning\
  \ out their second-floor windows to empty buckets of water. It's not clear if this\
  \ is an act of generosity to refresh us or an act of hostility. Possibly it's both.\n\
  \nIt's 9 a.m., and I estimate my friends and I are the only sober attendees in the\
  \ crowd of over 20,000. I'm wearing a t-shirt announcing the festival with the town's\
  \ name misspelled, and a plastic lanyard hangs from my neck to hold my waterproof\
  \ camera and money. As we near the quaint square from my t.v., the narrow main road\
  \ becomes impassable and we can go no further. There are already signs the day won't\
  \ go as expected. Drunken adolescents are pitching objects in the air in anticipation;\
  \ a leather shoe spirals through the sky to find my head. \n\nIt's 11 a.m., and\
  \ the battle begins. Open-top trucks crawl down the main street, brimming with tomatoes\
  \ that are tossed into the crowds by helpers. People scramble to the ground to scoop\
  \ tomato pulp and smash it against each other in orgiastic fervor. My friends and\
  \ I grasp uselessly for tomato bits. Suddenly, there is a foreboding electricity,\
  \ and the crowds tense in the collective belief a truck is about to divert from\
  \ the main street and turn down our swollen side street. Everyone begins to tangle\
  \ and push. I am carried forward by the panicked mob, my feet floating above the\
  \ street and my ribs compressed by the force of the mass. Now I should mention something\
  \ here, I have always passionately hated tomatoes. As I contemplate my final moments\
  \ on Earth, the irony of this death by tomato settles in. I imagine loved ones struggling\
  \ to mourn my comedic ending. I was going to die, but worse yet, my death was going\
  \ to be the stuff of late-night show headline gags. In the riptide of jostling elbows\
  \ and shoulders, a wisp of a girl with long brown hair turns to me and wails, \"\
  Nos vamos a morir!\" I assure her we will live. I believe this lie to be my last\
  \ kind act, and I feel pleased. I lose sight of her. Seconds, minutes, hours later,\
  \ the waves of people collapse to a halt. My feet touch down on terra firma, the\
  \ Picasso collage of disjointed limbs and heads reassembles into bodies, and all\
  \ of us had lived. Even the winsome brunette.\n\nI find one friend just a few feet\
  \ away, and the other is matted against a nearby wall. We greet each other like\
  \ reunited comrades-in-arms. We trade our battle stories and exhale. Bloody masses\
  \ of tomato pulps litter the street, and we tread victoriously across the carnage.\
  \ Then we do the only fitting thing  if you survive a festival in a small town in\
  \ Spain--we head immediately to the nearest beer stand. \"Tres ca\xF1as, por favor.\"\
  \ \n\n*Fear of Missing Out"
