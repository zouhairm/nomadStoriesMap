Text: "It's a bitterly frigid October morning. Frost is stuck to the grass and the\
  \ sky is saturated with roiling gray clouds. You are rush-walking from one Bygd\xF8\
  y museum to the other, hoping to finish your visit before the rain. It's a five\
  \ minute walk to the Norsk Folkemuseum, an open air museum of Norsk cultural history\
  \ from the 1500s. You are most interested in the architecture. You buy your ticket\
  \ from a dull looking man. He hands you a map of the grounds; a large simulated\
  \ town of buildings relocated from all over regions of Norway. You take your time\
  \ walking through fake cobblestone streets and past old barns with roofs buried\
  \ under bright, lime-green moss. Each house describes the region it hails from.\
  \ You read each plaque meticulously\n\nThere are only a few others in the museum,\
  \ including a rowdy group of highschoolers. You dislike their noise, so you sacrifice\
  \ a few plaques to move ahead of them. You are in the back of the museum now, alone.\
  \ Some houses you can climb into and see bedrooms. Little rooms with tiny beds and\
  \ beautiful fraying tapestries and quilts. It's strange. The air seems tense, as\
  \ if holding a breath. Each house stands on stilts and you swear you can see things\
  \ moving under them.\n\n\u201CJust your imagination,\u201D you say out loud to set\
  \ yourself at ease. \n\nNevertheless, you hurry through the path of old homes until\
  \ you see a couple strolling up a path into the woods. Rather, a thin grouping of\
  \ trees hiding a building at the top of a hill. The smell of rain is heavy. You\
  \ follow the couple. The higher you get, the more you can see of a big white house\
  \ and the tip of a church. The house does not interest you, as the architecture\
  \ is less Norwegian and more English. The church is the mystery, hidden behind trees,\
  \ waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe pathway is riddled with roots. The couple pauses\
  \ to kiss and you pass by, blushing for them. You round the corner of the woods\
  \ and there it stands. The grandest and simplest and most honest church you've seen.\
  \ It's brown and wooden and carved with serpents and bears and other Norsk imagery.\
  \ The roof raises four levels and curves outward, giving it an almost Asian appearance.\
  \ There are people milling about it, reading the plaque and touching the carvings.\
  \ You find out it's a Stave church relocated from northern Norway. It smells strongly\
  \ of pine and paint. No one walked inside the church but the door stood open, inviting.\
  \ You step toward it, feeling a pull inside your chest. You can hear others whispering.\
  \ \n\nThere is heaviness, rather suddenly. Nothing real. Nothing physical. Something\
  \ not happy, not sad, just neutral and heavy. It's silent. There are a few pews\
  \ and faint, dull paintings of some mythology, not quite Norsk nor Christian. It's\
  \ small inside, with room for ten or fifteen people. You wind around the side of\
  \ the church. There are tears. You start crying and heaving. Your chest feels restricted.\
  \ You lean against the intricately carved side entrance and lay your head against\
  \ the ancient wood. There is an energy here, sapping emotional energy from you and\
  \ you don't know why. \n\nYou've had experiences like this, where something feels\
  \ so steeped in history that it comes alive. Canterbury Cathedral was like that.\
  \ And Stonehenge. But this, this felt sadder. Not in a negative way. In a way that\
  \ felt fleeting, as if nothing in the world could keep this church from eventual\
  \ collapse into nothingness. As if the walls themselves were afraid of becoming\
  \ dust as soon as someone touched them.\n\nYou consider staying to journal. This\
  \ is the most intense you've felt in a long time and it's invigorating. Without\
  \ warning, the clenching in your chest guided you away from the building and down\
  \ the wooded path. It started to rain gently on your way to the bus. \t\n\nEvery\
  \ couple seconds, you couldn't help but look back at the church, over and over and\
  \ over again. It wanted you back. It wanted to keep you. Wanted to borrow your energy\
  \ until it sucks you dry."
