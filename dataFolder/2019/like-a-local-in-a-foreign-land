Text: "Wanderlust has been genetic to me. I\u2019ve always seen my father travelling\
  \ to different parts of the world for business, and when he comes back I used to\
  \ adore the stamp on his passport or the smell of boarding passes, always like a\
  \ curious butterfly listened to the city-it\u2019s people, culture and heritage.\
  \ My first international trip was to Istanbul and that time I was only 13, and they\
  \ say things that happen in your teenage remains deep in your heart, and just like\
  \ that I feel in love with flying, travelling, getting stamped, visiting a new nation.\
  \ The first time I sat in flight was directly abroad and had no local experience,\
  \ I just didn\u2019t feel butterflies in my stomach but the entire zoo, it seemed\
  \ like magic, it was an overnight flight, flying above my home city and seeing it\
  \ dwelled in lights seemed eclectic, the joy of waving it good bye never felt so\
  \ beautiful. Tucked the seat belt, and our journey began. After few hours, we reached\
  \ Istanbul, the city is a perfect mix of old and new, modern and heritage, beautifully\
  \ connected by the Europe and Asia border, every corner had something to find, a\
  \ charm in its own. From Turkish dondurmas (ice cream which is fooloishly given\
  \ to you by making you laugh a little) to baklavas (a true delicacy in the mouth)\
  \ to Simmit which you can hop on while cruising and watching seagulls showing you\
  \ the way of life- to live freely and fly highly. That trip was one hell of a experience,\
  \ and after that I can\u2019t believe when I do some counting, that I\u2019ve been\
  \ there 4 times to be precise, last time even the immigration officer asked- why\
  \ do you travel to only Turkey, there are so many beautiful countries yet to be\
  \ explored, I laughed and said I want to visit every country so well that I don\u2019\
  t feel like a foreigner in a foreign land, I want to feel it as a Home, as a local,\
  \ as a soul who loves her life as it\u2019s so big, but her wanderlust is so deep\
  \ as the world is bigger. I just don\u2019t want to travel, I want to write Down\
  \ my experiences, a true traveller just doesn\u2019t roams, but also tells the stories\
  \ of the journey. I don\u2019t want to visit 10 or 15 countries, I want to visit\
  \ all of the 196, as every part of the world is unique in its own way, something\
  \ so vastly distinctive to offer. I want to start my own travel magazine, host my\
  \ own travel shows. Till now, I\u2019ve been to Switzerland, France, Nepal and oh\
  \ my favourite-Turkey."
