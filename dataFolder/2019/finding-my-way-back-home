Text: "The flight attendant started with the mundane speech of safety protocols. I\
  \ looked on trying to make out any words that seemed recognizable. She stopped speaking,\
  \ turned to me and repeated everything in English. It dawned on me, out of 150 plus\
  \ people, I was the only one that didn\u2019t speak Portuguese or Creole. What had\
  \ I gotten myself into? \n\nI sat on the plane and looked out the window holding\
  \ back tears. I was excited but anxious. This was my first solo trip and the first\
  \ time visiting Cape Verde. I would be the first in my family to return in over\
  \ 100 years since their immigration to America in the 1890\u2019s. This trip was\
  \ not just for me, but for my grandmother who will never get a chance to see home.\
  \ So, I took it all in and sat back while preparing myself for the journey.  \n\n\
  It was Carnival in the city of Mindelo: the atmosphere was energetic with the sound\
  \ of music pulsating through the streets. I maneuvered through the city taking it\
  \ all in. From the Morna music of Ces\xE1ria \xC9vora playing off floats to the\
  \ women adorned in vibrant costumes dancing the Funan\xE1 in the streets. I was\
  \ in awe by the soul of the city.      \n\nJailza, a local immersed in the city\
  \ guided me. Tight, spiraling curly hair and big brown eyes. Something about her\
  \ felt familiar. The longer we sat there the more she reminded me of my sister.\
  \ We sat outside overlooking the local beach, Praia da Laginha, where we talked\
  \ of family and life on the Islands. She shared her experience of attending University\
  \ in Brazil and the ignorance she faced of persons questioning her African roots.\n\
  \nI pointed out my reluctance to sometimes state I have Cape Verdean roots. Since\
  \ I had been judged before in America, I was unsure of how I would be accepted.\
  \ Jailza\u2019s warm embrace had reassured me that I too had a place here. She said,\
  \ \u201CWe\u2019re family, your always welcome even if you weren\u2019t born here.\u201D\
  \ These were the strong words my grandmother always yearned to hear. This felt like\
  \ home and it never felt so good to be here."
