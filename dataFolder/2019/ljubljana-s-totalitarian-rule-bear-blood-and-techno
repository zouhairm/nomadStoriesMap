Text: "As I looked out of the burnt-out charcoal black shell of the former BMW 3 series\
  \ that lay desolate amongst the overgrown grass, I surveyed the dimly lit swarm\
  \ of young and old chatting amongst the graffiti covered ruins of a former military\
  \ barracks belonging to the Yugoslav and Austro-Hungarian Army. Strobe lights inconsistently\
  \ flickered illuminating the mass of people, whilst I sat in a dark corner of what\
  \ was effectively the city\u2019s main congregation point. \n\n\u201CDo you want\
  \ another shot of this?\u201D Dan spluttered. \n\nThe dark blue liquid that tastes\
  \ like a mixture of fire and berries, deceptively known by the entrancing name Bear\
  \ Blood, sold in the bar named Yalla Yalla, dripped down his unkempt, hairy face.\
  \ \n\n\u201CNo,\u201D I joked, \u201CI\u2019m the designated driver\u201D. \n\n\
  At that moment, a young and singing Slovenian girl jumped off the roof of the burnt-out\
  \ Beemer and screamed, \u201CZieg Heil\u201D. Her friend, the only to speak English\
  \ in the group, explained it was an anti-fascist song, for Metelkova City in Ljubljana,\
  \ Slovenia\u2019s unofficial second capital, was known to be the heart of all anarchist\
  \ and free-thinking thought in the city. Around me I could hear overpowering sound\
  \ of Techno thumping out of the collection of gloomy clubs sprawled throughout the\
  \ former military complex. But what was I doing here? Eighteen years old and fresh\
  \ out of school, I had undertaken a voyage of self-discovery around Europe. I thought\
  \ this place was a mythical anarchist commune of which I should have been scared,\
  \ but this was the most enticing and unexpectedly endearing location I visited that\
  \ summer. When I arrived in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana, a time capsule of\
  \ the Austro-Hungarian empire, I did not expect to find Metelkova City.\n\nMetelkova\
  \ City was, and indeed is, a retreat for the free thinkers and anarchists in society,\
  \ who want a space for their own self-expression and identity. After centuries of\
  \ being ruled by a foreign power, the Slovenes finally have their own republic.\
  \ Stereotypical central-European cobbled streets, pastel pink, blue, and white buildings\
  \ with copper red roofs prevailing through the city; the landscape remains just\
  \ as symbolic of the previous empires as ever, with Metelkova City opposing it.\
  \ Metelkova is the new face of Slovenia, the new capital city. Metelkova is Slovenia\u2019\
  s repressed identity that lives in an underground dirty environment of anarchism\
  \ and squat living. \n\nWhen I climbed up the small forested hill upon which lies\
  \ a castle with views for miles over the nation; the nation that was first to secede\
  \ from the former Yugoslavia, being recognised by the European Union as the Republic\
  \ of Slovenia in 1992. It was hard to believe that an independent Slovenia was only\
  \ six years older than me, for my generation, who were born after the fall of the\
  \ Berlin Wall and the fall of communism in Europe, the idea of a politically polarised\
  \ and divided Europe seems unimaginable. Walking under the glistening, summer sun\
  \ through the picturesque streets of Ljubljana, I would never have known that there\
  \ had been any form of totalitarian regime there in the last century, least of all\
  \ two. Metelkova is the voice of the young people who actively oppose fascism and\
  \ totalitarianism. Metelkova is more than just a city, it is more than just burnt\
  \ out BMW\u2019s and Bear Blood, it is a cultural identity; if the buildings crumble,\
  \ Metelkova will not.\n\nA squat-cum-cultural space and nightclub is not for everyone,\
  \ but if you\u2019re looking to see the edgy, raw and unpolished Ljubljana, beyond\
  \ the canals and the castle, stop by Metelkova City, meet the locals and drive a\
  \ burnt-out Beemer, but most importantly, head to Yalla Yalla bar and order a shot\
  \ of Bear Blood, but be warned, you won\u2019t need many."
