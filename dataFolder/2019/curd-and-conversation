Text: "\u201CDo you have any questions?\u201D\n\n\tYes, I wanted to reply. Why am\
  \ I such a pushover?\n\n\tI had planned a short stay in Nepal on my way to another\
  \ Himalayan kingdom, eager to experience more of South Asia.  Armed with my fuel\
  \ of choice \u2013 masala chai \u2013 I browsed Thamel\u2019s seemingly endless\
  \ souvenir stalls, snapped pictures of the Kathmandu valley from the renowned Monkey\
  \ Temple, and retired from the bustle of Patan by wandering their UNESCO-listed\
  \ museum. \n\n\tMy enjoyment had been clouded by conversations inside my head about\
  \ how I had accidentally checked in my backbone on the flight to Tribhuvan International\
  \ Airport, and it had gotten lost in transit. I had been talked into booking a scenic\
  \ flight to Everest, hustled into art studios, and pressured to write a good review\
  \ for my hotel in Kathmandu on the spot. As my budget took a hit, my wariness jumped\
  \ to an all-time high.\n\n\tBhaktapur had seemed like the best place to spend my\
  \ last day in the country; my online research claimed it would be a good place to\
  \ relax. I handed over the rupees for the entrance fee, and was promptly reminded\
  \ you can\u2019t believe everything you read. My eventual guide Raj approached,\
  \ offering his services. This should be the part where I said no, my spine had reappeared\
  \ in Bhaktapur just in time \u2013 yet in a few minutes, Raj was leading me from\
  \ one site to another. The city still showed damage from the 2015 earthquake, but\
  \ the history and grandeur of the structures was still impressive. It would\u2019\
  ve been even more so if Raj wasn\u2019t rushing his tour, and I soon found out why.\n\
  \n\tThirty minutes later, spineless me held a plastic bag containing the smallest\
  \ prayer bowl I could get away with, back at the entrance of Durbar Square. \n\n\
  \t\u201CDo you have any questions?\u201D\n\n\tI wanted to crawl back to my hotel\
  \ and sulk, but Raj had a big smile on his face; I decided to bring up a food item\
  \ I had been waiting to try in the city of its origin. King Curd, yoghurt derived\
  \ from buffalo milk and spices, was one purchase my dairy-obsessed self would not\
  \ need to be talked into \u2013 for once.\n\n\tRaj led me a few steps from the square\u2019\
  s entrance, to a stall where I was handed an earthenware bowl containing the sweet\
  \ treat for a hundred rupees. The tall, lanky man who manned the stall ushered me\
  \ inside after I asked if I could sit. I spent the first few minutes eating in silence,\
  \ but the man soon asked me how the King Curd was. \n\n\tThe man named Sushil and\
  \ I started conversing, peppered by the occasional customer asking for beverages.\
  \ An hour passed, and we had learned about each other\u2019s families and my time\
  \ in Nepal. I unashamedly had another King Curd, this time for half the price. An\
  \ inquiry if I had tried momos, Tibetan style dumplings often stuffed with buffalo,\
  \ led to Sushil scoffing when he heard the word \u201CThamel\u201D. He called his\
  \ brother over to purchase some; waving my money away, his brother came back with\
  \ steaming hot momos the three of us shared.\n\n\tThe sky gradually turned dark\
  \ blue, and Sushil\u2019s stall was closing for the day. My flight the next morning\
  \ ensured I wouldn\u2019t be able to purchase any more King Curd for the road, to\
  \ my disappointment. Sushil asked for my hotel\u2019s name and my departure time.\n\
  \n\tAs I sat in the hotel lobby the next day, a familiar-looking motorcycle called\
  \ me to the entrance. Sushil handed me a blue plastic bag, tied twice, a pint-size\
  \ container of King Curd inside.\n\n\tI reached into my pocket, where I had kept\
  \ a hundred rupees. He shook his head no. \u201CCome back to Bhaktapur,\u201D he\
  \ said, shaking my hand and puttering away.\n\n\tMy suitcase was strapped to the\
  \ top of the car on the way to the airport, but the plastic bag stayed next to me,\
  \ safe from the elements. I untied the plastic bag in the airport, eating all of\
  \ the curd with a wooden spoon as I waited for the check-in counter to open. \n\n\
  \tIt wasn\u2019t just my stomach that was full."
