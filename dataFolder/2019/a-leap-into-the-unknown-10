Text: "2019 was off to a busy start and I'd set my travel intentions on Machu Picchu.\
  \ A volunteer project in Peru had sparked my interest although had not eventuated.\n\
  \nThe trail closed in February. Maybe I could still go only for the trek? It seemed\
  \ like a long way to fly to go camping for four days!  I wanted to make the most\
  \ of my freedom between projects and to understand the people and culture.\n\nI\
  \ researched tour providers any way (manifestation, right?) - but how to choose?\
  \  I required a tour operator to access the Inca Trail - larger mainstream companies\
  \ had never been my style of adventure, so my preference was for a local, boutique\
  \ company. \n\nWith an array of local providers \u2013 I wondered if it would be\
  \ cheaper to book on arrival, keeping in mind the limited number of trail permits.\
  \  I landed on a website that promoted porter rights and claimed they were the only\
  \ operator to employ female porters.  Impressed by the reviews that included an\
  \ article by National Geographic, I approached the founder about a collaboration\
  \ between our businesses - if he agreed, it was surely meant to be?\n\nWhen the\
  \ founder himself replied, open to the exchange - it didn\u2019t leave me a lot\
  \ of time to decide \u2013 the final tour for the season was departing the following\
  \ week and I required time to travel and acclimatize to altitude. \n\nWith little\
  \ negotiation about what I\u2019d receive (apart from three weeks accommodation\
  \ and the four-day trek) or my deliverables, a chance encounter with someone who\
  \ had spent significant time in South America, allayed my fears and encouraged me\
  \ to leap into the unknown. \n\nMy first impression of South America was arriving\
  \ in Lima \u2013 my only predeparture research had been to watch Motorcycle Diaries\
  \ and I hadn\u2019t prepared for what is still very much a developing economy. \
  \ I felt like if I disappeared in the city, no one would find me. I hoped that Cusco,\
  \ (my base for three weeks) would be different!  Thankfully, it was.  With a population\
  \ of around 300,000 people, it was a pleasure to arrive in the charming and enchanting\
  \ historic centre.\n\nI met the founder at Capuccino, in Plaza de Aramas.  In an\
  \ attempt to define my scope, I immediately started to unpack the business goals\
  \ and objectives, however he seemed nonplussed: I was their first collaboration.\
  \ Until then, they\u2019d been digital nomads, setting up their first office that\
  \ week.  \n\nThe founder had worked as a guide and porter, starting the business\
  \ with the ethos of \u201Crevolutionising\u201D the industry. Despite government\
  \ regulations stating that porters cannot carry more than 16kg plus 4kg of their\
  \ personal belongings, most tour companies do not provide them with adequate clothing,\
  \ food or sleeping conditions. Too often porters slept in crowded in camp site toilet\
  \ blocks or under the kitchen/dining tent with no floor, trying to stay warm at\
  \ night.  Women were denied employment.\n\nThe founder showed me to my room in a\
  \ shared apartment, with his brother and brother\u2019s girlfriend, about 5km from\
  \ the historic centre. Did he forget to mention the city\u2019s water restrictions?\
  \ No hot water was available to shower at night, reminding me to negotiate details\
  \ before diving in!  Over the coming weeks, I learned that things never really run\
  \ to schedule in South America \u2013 meetings were late, planes were delayed or\
  \ cancelled, business and government lacked accountability. Yet these all seemed\
  \ trite compared to the injustice faced by many in the society. \n\nThe Inca Trail\
  \ was as magical as I expected, however as I talked to other trekkers on the trail,\
  \ the lack of awareness about the plight of women and the porters became apparent,\
  \ defining my project scope (and possibly life purpose): this project was not about\
  \ marketing but about social justice \u2013 to promote employment and women\u2019\
  s rights.  Acutely aware that I could not change this in three weeks, I recommended\
  \ establishing a program of ayni, Andean reciprocity, collaboration with people\
  \ and businesses to raise international awareness making each person who walked\
  \ the trail accountable for being an advocate of the cause. \n\nStep by slow step,\
  \ in the same way I walked the trail, we could impact global change. \n\nThis is\
  \ my contribution."
