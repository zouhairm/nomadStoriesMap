Text: "San Miguel \n\n(Draft for Portugal Voyage)\n\n\nSan Miguel was calling----I\
  \ needed to get the heck out of dodge, by which I mean Victioria Super Natural \"\
  British Columbia\" in the land of Canada home of the silverbirch land of the Beaver.\n\
  \nShe was heading there to learn silversmithing from an infamous expat who had been\
  \ on the lam for years, stationed as he is in the State of Guanajuato where he teaches\
  \ silver craft to the amazons of jewellery and their pals.\n\nI decided we would\
  \ ship out via airplane and rent an air b & b in the heart of the city not far from\
  \ where a friar had inadvertently set off the Mexican independance movement... a\
  \ fact I was later to learn from my American pal John Williamson whose name immediately\
  \ brought to mind the composer who had scored the music for Star Wars.\n\nLeaving\
  \ the Vancouver airport presented an unexpected difficulty- since it turned out\
  \ that I had neglected to update my passport. The woman at the desk decided to let\
  \ us pass so long as I promised to update it in Mexico City ( Districto Federale)\
  \ \n\n\nWhen we arrived in the heart of the city we found the way to the new abode.\
  \ The door knocker was gold with the face of a lion. \n\nAfter settling in and getting\
  \ a feel for SMA we found a place were I could get a 300 peso phone to call the\
  \ Canadian Embassy stationed in Diego & Fridas City.\n\nWhile the plan was taking\
  \ shape she spotted a girlfriend across the street, her tattoo catching the light\
  \ of the sun. She called out and yes it was Maggie from Vancouver the nurse who\
  \ had helped me rescue her in another story.\n\nThey got themselves enrolled in\
  \ two different silver lodges and I began my solo peregrinations."
