Text: "I have been to Qingdao and Neimenggu by alone participating in summer camps\
  \ when I was a five-year-old girl. After graduating from senior school, my family\
  \ and I have had a self-driving tour to Tibet, lasting for twenty days. During university,\
  \ I have visited a wide spectrum of places at home and abroad - such as Vietnam,\
  \ Japan, as well as cities in China like Dalian, Tianjin, Jinan, Hangzhou, Chongqing,\
  \ Sertar, Arxan - among which I travel alone or take charge of the whole journey\
  \ arrangements and schedules. Certainly, I have enjoyed exotic culture and broadened\
  \ my horizon through these journeys, and I have made friends with people having\
  \ same interests as well.\nHowever, the most significant meaning of travel, for\
  \ me, is to remind myself of OTHERS. For a long time, I have focused too much on\
  \ myself - such as whether I get a high GPA or not - even thus lacking adequate\
  \ care for the outside world. It\u2019s not until the summer vacation in 2017 that\
  \ I have got a clear awareness of so-called social responsibilities . At that time,\
  \ my team and I paid a visit to MaoXian in NW Sichuan, China. During the visit,\
  \ We conducted the social research about mountain landslide there on June 24th,\
  \ 2017. We spent one week in field investigation in MaoXian, interacting deeply\
  \ with local habitants and the government departments related. That\u2019s when\
  \ I felt quite strong desire to do something for THEM. And I did. Despite that what\
  \ I could contribute was restricted, my team and I had completed a research essay,\
  \  attempting to offer the early warning reference and alleviate sufferings of similar\
  \ natural disasters afterwards. Now, this time, I want to do more. So I choose this\
  \ program. There is a proverb saying boundless distance and countless people are\
  \ all related to me. That\u2019s the faith I\u2019m firmly convinced of. That\u2019\
  s what I\u2019m pursuing and seeking for."
