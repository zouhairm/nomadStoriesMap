Text: "I woke up in Dahab sticky, the salty humidity hanging in the air. I hadn\u2019\
  t even seen Egypt in the daylight yet. How had we gotten there? Hannah and I processed\
  \ the previous day\u2019s affairs:\n\nA dust covered truck sliding through the desert\
  \ of Wadi Rum. \n\nThe most expensive cab. \n\nA ferry full of the curious eyes\
  \ of truckers.\n\nThe panic of miscommunication.\n\nBut with luck and a lot of chaos,\
  \ there we were. The last 24 hours felt like wading through murky waters. Somehow,\
  \ through that mess of events, we ended up a five minute walk from where we were\
  \ meant to be, only hours later, at our scuba diving center. \nMy only thought was\
  \ food. As a diabetic that\u2019s nearly always on my mind. We saw a friendly face\
  \ wearing a familiar logo in the crowd; a woman from our scuba company. She greeted\
  \ us and welcomed us in. She pointed out her favorite breakfast spot in town, Yum\
  \ Yums. We bolted across the dusty road towards our first taste of Egypt.\nA stranger\
  \ with intimate eyes greeted us. Our tongues tripped and didn\u2019t quite match.\
  \ Smiles were exchanged and a sad attempt at Arabic escaped my lips. He said his\
  \ name was Emad.\nWe filled our bellies while my thoughts fixated on the attractive\
  \ stranger. He caught me staring but didn\u2019t seem to mind. Hannah and I paid\
  \ our check as I planned our return.\nWe headed to our scuba course. I was about\
  \ to conquer one of my greatest fears. As we slid into our wetsuits, I peppered\
  \ my anxiety with curiosity to avoid bolting. Hannah plays water polo; at least\
  \ she could save me if I drown.\nWith a minor buoyancy problem, and an eel in startling\
  \ proximity, we survived our first day. I found my way back to the falafel restaurant.\
  \ I\u2019m sure Hannah said something but I must\u2019ve been distracted.\nThe next\
  \ three days went along quite the same:\n\nfalafel, \nscuba, \nfalafel,\nsleep.\n\
  \nThe repetitive schedule had become familiar and somewhat comforting. \nOur last\
  \ day was a big one, our scuba certification. It also happened to be New Years Eve.\
  \ Hannah and I had no plans but mastering our open water skills. With our last dive\
  \ I was on top of the world. I now held a certification card proving I had overcome\
  \ something that once terrified me. \nOn our normal route back to the hostel, we\
  \ stopped for one last falafel dinner. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to flirt. I\
  \ felt tongue tied in Emad\u2019s presence.\nSomeone noticed my wandering heart;\
  \ a man working that I hadn\u2019t seen before, Amr. He came by to tease me about\
  \ the affection in my eyes. Amr and Hannah began to plot a way to bring Emad and\
  \ I closer; we\u2019d all spend New Year\u2019s Eve together that night.\nAfter\
  \ dinner Hannah fell ill. I didn\u2019t want to leave her, but she encouraged me\
  \ to go and return with a story to tell. I turned back at least a dozen times, but\
  \ ultimately found the courage to step into the restaurant. \nEmad held my hand\
  \ as we wandered through the dark. The music was too loud and the crowd too drunk\
  \ but our lack of dance skills kept us laughing. At midnight we shared a timid,\
  \ intoxicating kiss while the bar erupted around us. \nAfter dancing into the new\
  \ year, I helped him carry burdensome buckets full of fava beans to the restaurant\
  \ in the early hours of the morning. The light from the sun was just about to break\
  \ the horizon.  We stopped to look at the stars, and were not quite able put into\
  \ words the thoughts we shared.\nI snuck in a few hours of sleep before Hannah and\
  \ I had to catch our bus. I ran to make sure I didn\u2019t miss saying goodbye.\
  \ A thought crossed my mind: with no phone and no computer, how would he stay in\
  \ touch? \nEmad had packed us lunches for the nine hour bus ride to Cairo. We said\
  \ goodbye, and we kissed one last time. As we parted only one word left his mouth:\
  \ \u0628\u062D\u0628\u0643 (I love you). I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever stop crying."
