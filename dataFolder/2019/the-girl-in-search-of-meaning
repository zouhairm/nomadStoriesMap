Text: "It was a Sunday morning. Scathed in cold, winter air and last nights wine.\
  \ \nThe day had somehow begun whilst already feeling like a distant memory. \nIt\
  \ was in sepia tones that you walked into my world. Axel. A strange man, feminine,\
  \ half awake and dog-eyed. \nYou neglectingly bumped into my little caf\xE9 table,\
  \ pushing my half-full ashtray to the floor. \nWe locked eyes for a brief moment,\
  \ you seemed ready to cry in that moment but instead fell deeper into my world.\n\
  Maybe you sensed my calmness, my lack of protective glass or saw my second helping\
  \ of honey in my tea. \nBut it was then you sat down in front of me, and let me\
  \ begin my search for the meaning of Paris in a young man. \nTo describe you was\
  \ not hard, you're a film to be admired through. A beautiful man, your broken English\
  \ and my broken French melted together nicely. We spoke together in this strange,\
  \ non-conforming puzzle pieces for hours. \nYou titled yourself, 'The Lover and\
  \ the Joker of Paris', I laughed and we ordered more coffee. \nIt was through an\
  \ elaborate and nonsensical game of what could have been charades, we learned of\
  \ one another. We spoke of poetry and our love for Plath. Our views on Hughes and\
  \ how he just could have been there more. You spoke to me how Paris is quite simply\
  \ a melting pot; something of love and caricature. A deviant city, half skin and\
  \ half danger. I asked you something I ask every stranger I meet, and that is \"\
  What is your colour?\" (This is a tactic I use with my best friend, a code word\
  \ asking for a more poetic description of how you're feeling on that day. The rules\
  \ are you can use photos, pictures, words, colors, anything to describe. But its\
  \ intention is to move away from the simple \"how are you? Fine.\" \n\nIt came time\
  \ to ask you yours, and this is what truth you spoke to me of the day.\n\nMy name\
  \ is Axel,\nI love to drink \nI love to do drugs. \nI am gay every second day. \n\
  Sometimes every third.\nMy love of substance\nhelps me accept the world\nthat for\
  \ some reason does not yet accept me.\nBecause for a moment, \nA single moment \n\
  I can\u2019t see them\nOr hear them\nA sweet disposition \nThe world is suddenly\
  \ just colour and raw, present emotion.\nHow I feel \nWhat I feel\nIs nothing more\
  \ or less\nOf anything\nAnd I am finally present\nAnd I feel encountered bliss.\n\
  \nThis spoke deeply to me of Paris, of numbness and liberation. Calm nothingness\
  \ and everythingness. \nMemories and future melt together and become present.\n\
  The Sunday in Paris with you was everything and nothing at all, at once."
