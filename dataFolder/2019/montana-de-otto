Text: "As he sat there looking out on pueblo of Urubamba, I caught a glimpse of the\
  \ boy he once was. His hair was tousled in that slightly boyish way, his ears tipped\
  \ pink from the cold. His eyes told a different story however, for in them he appeared\
  \ many years his senior--a man who had learned too many truths of the world. \n\n\
  \u201CWe came here once when I was fourteen,\u201D he said, squinting his eyes as\
  \ if he could see beyond the mountain in the distance into his home city of Cusco,\
  \ Peru. \u201CMy parents were arguing, so I brought him here so he wouldn\u2019\
  t be scared. He rode on my shoulders the whole way up.\u201D\n\nI smiled momentarily,\
  \ thinking of a young Otto with his little brother Jacomo clinging to his back as\
  \ they climbed the endless peaks of the mountain, taking breaks to dip their toes\
  \ in frigid mountain streams and explore nearby Incan ruins. I\u2019d come to know\
  \ Otto\u2019s spirit quite well in the last six months, and I could almost see his\
  \ broad smile on a younger boy\u2019s face as he carried his brother high into the\
  \ Andes. \n\nThat smile wasn\u2019t visible now, and instead his dark eyes shone\
  \ with an intensity that only appeared in rare moments. I moved to sit next to him,\
  \ and we both laid our backs down on the cool rock below, ignoring the chill seeping\
  \ through our jackets as we stared up at the sweeping mountain peaks above our heads.\
  \ Sometimes it seemed as though the mountains here went on forever.\n\n\u201CI come\
  \ here to think about him sometimes,\u201D Otto said. \u201CWhen we were young we\u2019\
  d all come here together, my brothers and me. We\u2019d camp just beyond the snow,\
  \ drink Cusque\xF1as, wake up early the next morning to climb to the summit. I\u2019\
  m the only one who\u2019s returned here since we spread his ashes.\u201D\n\nI could\
  \ picture the scene in my mind, a family with equally dark eyes sitting in this\
  \ very spot, mourning the loss of one of their own. I could visualize a young Otto,\
  \ his features softened by youth and yet with the same intensity in his gaze, thinking\
  \ of never again holding his small brother on his shoulders. I could hear the screech\
  \ of tires, smell the rain on the road, visualize the flames slowly consuming the\
  \ car, but I could only imagine how it must feel to lose a brother in mere moments.\n\
  \nOtto had told me this story before, one night months ago on a bumpy bus ride through\
  \ the Sacred Valley. I had woken to find his hand gripping mine, his eyes fixated\
  \ on the dark, winding road ahead. He had put his head on my shoulder and whispered\
  \ the story to me so as not to wake our nearby companions, telling me first of Jacomo,\
  \ of their adventures, of his death. Though mere months beforehand we had not known\
  \ of each other's existence, separated by language, by time, by culture, there was\
  \ nothing separating us in this moment. \n\nYet it was only as I sat staring out\
  \ at the endless stretch of mountains that I understood the true immensity of this\
  \ visit. Much of my life would forever remain a mystery to Otto, and much of his\
  \ to me. We were raised miles apart, in cultures that too often contradict one another\
  \ and speaking languages the other did not understand. He was peruano through and\
  \ through, I a gringa down to my core, and yet here we were, sharing this moment\
  \ in his sacred place. \n\nLove is universal, as is loss."
