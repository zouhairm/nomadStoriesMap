Text: "I have a list. A list were I write down all my experiences that makes me realise\
  \ what life truly is. These experiences are small events occuring in our everyday\
  \ life which makes our life the beautiful and stunning journey it is. I believe\
  \ that experiencing these moments are vital and are part of building up ourselves\
  \ as from within.\n\nThe wind gently caught my messy hair and gave it the character\
  \ of a real adventurer. I didn\u2019t imagine that cold morning in April when I\
  \ stepped onto the bus in my small hometown of Arvika, Sweden, that I would get\
  \ to add another revelation to my list. Going by bus from Sweden to Germany, passing\
  \ through Denmark, was a journey on it\u2019s own. Looking out over the fields shifting\
  \ in green and yellow shades, inhaling the scent of the forest as I remember it\
  \ from my childhood brought up feelings hidden deep in my heart, making me emotional,\
  \ longing for a time when life was free from worries and pressure. As we live in\
  \ our busy, high-tech society I believe that we tend to forget the importance of\
  \ practising patience in order to live more slowly. Everything doesn\u2019t have\
  \ to go at the speed of light, going by bus is certainly a new, or introduction\
  \ of an old, way to travel which gives you the opportunity to view the world from\
  \ a new perspective. Going by bus, or train for that matter, also requires you to\
  \ use different transportation. Reaching southern Sweden we had to travel by ferry\
  \ to beautiful Saksk\xF8bing - a small, cozy town in the heart of Denmark. Providing\
  \ me with a delicious, vegan pizza, I could finally see the world clear again. Walking\
  \ on the empty streets of a foreign town, watching the few trees, unsure whether\
  \ they should bloom out in their bright green colours yet or if it\u2019s to early,\
  \ gave me a feeling of euphoria. Spring was on it\u2019s way and I was walking together\
  \ with my beloved friends in place I never been to before. Life is so unpredictable.\n\
  \nThe next morning we waved goodbye to Denmark and entered Germany. It\u2019s something\
  \ with crossing a new border, realising you\u2019re in a new country. A place with\
  \ a whole different language, currency, culture and in this case, a very different\
  \ history. Driving on autobahn was a weird feeling. A road without limits. What\
  \ if the world would be like the autobahn - limitless. As we drove passed gas station\
  \ by gas station, the spring approached us like we were travelling through time,\
  \ at least for the imaginative mind, when really we were just travelling south.\
  \ Reaching Gelnhausen I was both happy, excited and to be fair, slightly nervous.\
  \ Living with a host family and an exchange student I\u2019ve never met before is\
  \ something I deeply recommend. This way you get to experience the journey to the\
  \ heart of the people. Who are they? What are the differences between you? But most\
  \ of all, what are your similarities?\n\nGelnhausen is a city for wanderers. Perhaps\
  \ it\u2019s in the small corners of the world that we find the missing parts of\
  \ ourselves. There\u2019s one evening I remember in particular - an evening I would\
  \ never had experienced if I'd have lived in a fancy hotel suite. My newly found\
  \ friend and I went bowling and as the eager competitor I am, I was slightly grumpy\
  \ of coming in second but that feeling was soon forgotten. Leaving the bowlinghall,\
  \ tired with a warm, fuzzy feeling from all the laughs and nice conversations I\
  \ had had with the locals. Despite my loss, I was happy. Never in my life had I\
  \ ridden a scooter. I sat behind my friend, driving under the streetlights, slightly\
  \ scared but with a spark of courage I had never experienced before. Suddenly the\
  \ road was cleared from cars, the night approached us and the wind caught my long,\
  \ dirty hair, as if it invited it to a dance. The stars spread across the sky, accompanied\
  \ by the moon. I breathed the cold, fresh air. As I looked up in the sky, all my\
  \ worries were long forgotten. That\u2019s when I realised - this is life."
