Text: "Freedom.Is the word we seek ,and most of the teens are looking after this but\
  \ sometimes they do not know what they want and we are say yes for everything is\
  \ sound good for us .\nWell my trip start like this  was start of March last year\
  \ when I wanted to taste the freedom, for me mean the freedom was to decide when\
  \ I want to take my bag and to buy a plane ticket and just say goodbye for everyone\
  \ and to see what really means a life behind the borders of my country . I just\
  \ wanted the freedom to roam wherever I wanted, without having money and just leaving\
  \ like the ancestors giving what you have in exchange for some food , drink or a\
  \ place to sleep . So I decide to go to Gaziantep , in turkey for 2 months .For\
  \ 2 weeks I traveled around Turley by hitchhiking alone, a woman but with a knife\
  \ on her foot and with just one dream to see what is there .\nThe way started to\
  \ be good but I I have to change the  car because I want to go in Konya not in Ankara\
  \ so I got a new car with 4 men .I am between 2 men  I started to speak with them\
  \ in English and after I tried to speak a little bit Turkish but I found myself\
  \ looking into dark brown eyes glittering with cruel amusement.My heart stopped\
  \ .The breath in my lungs threatened to choke, Why ? Because the men from the car\
  \ starting to fight and I didn\u2019t know what should I do and because I was between\
  \ these men\u2026\u2026.I was so lucky . The men pointed me with the fingers and\
  \ I didn\u2019 t understand it .Yet the reality started to show me in my face .\n\
  I looked around in the helpless desperation, through I was not sure what help I\
  \ expected to find in the crowd of strangers how look at me with a big stranger\
  \ smile .\n\u201C I won\u2019t go with you \u201C, I said , attending to pull the\
  \ driver arm on left to stop the car .\n\u201C oh but you look very beautiful and\
  \ you will be my wife \u201C one of the guys near to me , showed me the gun.\nI\
  \ learned to get my pocketknife from my ankle .It was the last thing in the world\
  \ I wanted to do but , with a gun pointing at my arm , I was powerless ,and I put\
  \ the knife of the neck of the driver .\n\u201Cyou will pull over here or this will\
  \ be the last think you will remember \u201C I was strong but with a hear like a\
  \ rabbit batting so fast .\nOf course, I love meeting new people and seeing places\
  \ I never would have otherwise, but it\u2019s really the freedom that inspired me\
  \ in this country.\nWhen I come to my home I met a guy in the plain and he said\
  \ :\n\u201CThere is somewhere a wonderful land ... a land lighted by love, where\
  \ smiles are priceless treasures and time nestles in embellishments ... where thunder\
  \ and creeping memories breeze you staring dust over the eyes, where a crystalline\
  \ river of hope passes all by waiting always let yourself be carried by its waves\
  \ to new places ... where a hand can pierce the bluster of the universe when it\
  \ comes to embrace the shoulder of the dear one who tells her ... I am next to you\
  \ ... where a glance can crush unencumbered walls whispering ... I understand you\
  \ ... where a word shakes worlds of thoughts and feelings ... I love ...\u201D\n\
  \nYou can continue what he said and always be informed where you will go or just\
  \ taste the moment doesn\u2019t matter it is bad or good was a free lesson ."
