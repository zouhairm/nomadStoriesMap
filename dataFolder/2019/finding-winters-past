Text: "I am going to the end of the world mostly to seek out penguins. It isn\u2019\
  t until halfway through the 48-hour bus ride from Buenos Aires that I am informed\
  \ that they will be gone for the season, migrated or in hibernation. But by then\
  \ the flat, brilliant expanse of Patagonia at dawn out the window, endless long\
  \ grass dusted with pink and purple, is reason enough to keep going. June, mid-winter,\
  \ is precisely the wrong time to visit Ushuaia. The city breathes to the rhythm\
  \ of the tourist season, inhaling in October when the spring rolls in, exhaling\
  \ in March as the autumn deepens.\n\nI arrive the following evening. I am this hostel\u2019\
  s lone guest for the week. The main drag by the water, la Avenida Prefectura Naval\
  \ Argentina, is empty of crowds but for a few scattered visitors, and peppered with\
  \ shuttered tourist stalls, closed for the winter. Their exteriors advertise boat\
  \ tours, wildlife excursions, and cruise options to Antarctica, some 620 miles away.\n\
  \nI wander the near-abandoned city, a dark blue pervading the air, in and out of\
  \ those gift shops that have remained open through the off season. I buy a stuffed\
  \ penguin. There are images of penguins everywhere in Ushuaia, somewhat surreal\
  \ when the penguins themselves are on vacation. I climb the mountain, away from\
  \ the docks, into quiet residential neighborhoods - ramshackle homes and modest\
  \ apartment buildings built into the steep incline.\n\n\u201CThe End of The World,\u201D\
  \ or \u201CEl Fin Del Mundo,\u201D is a gimmick which, it seems, enjoys infinite\
  \ reincarnation. The hostel at the end of the world, the restaurant at the end of\
  \ the world, the gift shop at the end of the world - all these businesses compete\
  \ with others bearing the same tagline. And here, in the dead of winter, with relentless\
  \ winds and daylight spanning only a few hours, the apocalyptic air of those words\
  \ likely rings truer than during the warmer, busier months. Part tourist trap, part\
  \ ghost town, it feels like the end of the world.\n\nBut for all the duplicate business\
  \ names, there is only one Train at the End of the World. From an old station that\
  \ lies a taxi ride outside the city, the train departs, swerving through a breathtaking\
  \ landscape of snowy woods and frozen streams, and the tour includes a bilingual\
  \ audio guide. The recording details the city\u2019s history as a penal colony in\
  \ the mid-to-late 19th century, with mostly political prisoners shipped into the\
  \ region to build the town and the railway, to cement Ushuaia as a viable metropolis\
  \ for continued migration. The train is comfortable, and for an additional fee,\
  \ one can ride first class. After the ride, once the other handful of passengers\
  \ have disembarked, I sit in the first class coach with the train staff and together\
  \ we nibble the leftovers from the complimentary snack plates provided to those\
  \ who paid extra. Tiny alfajores and instant coffee. When I step out, the gift shop\
  \ offers ample prison-themed kitsch, but I have no use for a vintage style jailhouse\
  \ uniform.\n\nThe history of the city\u2019s development throws its present into\
  \ stark contrast - ambling through rows of cheery gift shops, one would hardly stop\
  \ to think of decades of freezing prison labor. Tierra del Fuego as a site of wealthy\
  \ settlement well before its transformation into a center of tourism would have\
  \ been impossible were it not for the physical toil - and sometimes death - of Argentina\u2019\
  s political prisoners, and this knowledge somehow deepens the early dusk as it falls\
  \ over a city lying in wait for the spring.\n\nMy time in Ushuaia lasts just under\
  \ a week - one of solitude, spent roaming mostly empty alleyways in the snow and\
  \ watching the fleeting daylight, of an ethereal, almost mystical quality in the\
  \ deep southern winter. The morning my return bus leaves, I oversleep and miss the\
  \ departure, and after hitchhiking back across the Strait of Magellan to catch the\
  \ next one from Rio Gallegos, the bustling avenues and sunlight of this other place\
  \ make Ushuaia seem like a dream. 12 hours to go before the bus departs. I lay my\
  \ head on a stuffed penguin on a bench in the station and sleep."
