Text: "If someone were to ask me what my ultimate travel highlight is, the first thing\
  \ that initially springs to my mind is my experience of a safari game drive through\
  \ the impressive 1,640 km\xB2  Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa. This\
  \ natural landscape, located near Port Elizabeth at the end of the Garden Route,\
  \ is one of the nineteen conservational national parks and the third largest in\
  \ South Africa. What started as eleven elephants in 1931, now in 2018 is six hundred.\
  \ Not just elephants however, Addo also encompasses wild lions, leopards, buffalo,\
  \ zebra, warthog, black rhino, hyena, and much more... and if you're lucky enough,\
  \ you will be able to spot them!\n\nSouth Africa's diverse wildlife remains as one\
  \ of my favourite things about the country. We set off on our two hour journey from\
  \ the super chilled out surfing town of Jeffrey's Bay to Addo Elephant National\
  \ Park at an awfully early start of 5am, the sun was barely beginning to rise and\
  \ to be honest, I was on an adrenaline comedown from the day before. After completing\
  \ one of the world's highest bungee jumps (709 feet!) from Bloukrans Bridge, I felt\
  \ worn out, dreary, and all I could think was 'God, this better be worth it'. And\
  \ it was. It wasn't until 8am until we actually entered the park, yet the African\
  \ sun was already beginning to beat down aggressively. I looked outside of the vehicle\
  \ window as we were driving through the entrance, all I could spot was an endless\
  \ horizon of shrubs, bushes, grass and other various sub-desert features. Our driver\
  \ informed us that if we were lucky to see any lions, they would be hiding very\
  \ discreetly in the thick green bushes, and spotting them this late in the morning\
  \ is often very rare due to the heat (and there's only actually ten of them in the\
  \ whole park). There was however one glimmer of hope, when our driver spotted around\
  \ six cars stopped in the dirt track in the distance taking pictures and pondering\
  \ over a big creature lying down and hiding in the bushes: some saying hyena, while\
  \ others persisted it was a lioness. Everyone, including myself, began to zoom in\
  \ on our cameras to try and figure out what exactly it was. To our amusement, it\
  \ stood up as our tour guide peered through his binoculars and it just turned out\
  \ to be a large warthog! It was entertaining hearing people groan and instantly\
  \ drive off when they, too, realised. Pumbaa deserves some love too! \n\nI witnessed\
  \ quite a large variety of wildlife in Addo that day; zebras, kudus, warthogs, a\
  \ jackal, buffalos, dung beetle and even a giant tortoise chilling on the side of\
  \ the road! However, in all honesty, it was the mass amount of African elephants,\
  \ arguably the most majestic wild animal, that astonished me the most. At first,\
  \ a couple of these friendly giants strolled past the vehicle like it was nothing,\
  \ I couldn't believe how close they were to me as I peered from the open window.\
  \ All I could think was how much of a privilege it is to be in their presence as\
  \ they stood there before me. By the the time we reached a watering hole, clearly\
  \ popular among the elephants in the park, I couldn't believe how many more we were\
  \ seeing. At first my tour driver counted between 70 - 80 elephants bathing, playing,\
  \ eating and drinking in the watering hole, I felt like I was on the set of BBC's\
  \ Planet Earth and David Attenborough was going to appear at any given moment with\
  \ a running commentary. I sat still, I watched, I admired, I took hundreds of photos,\
  \ and I waited. More and more families of elephants were majestically arriving into\
  \ the area and charging through to get to the water. In the end, I believe there\
  \ was over one hundred of them. Even our tour driver was astonished, and believed\
  \ us to be very lucky as he himself had never seen so many of them together in one\
  \ place at one time in harmony like we did that day."
