Text: "The  sky  exploded  a  violet  red.  The  night  momentarily  lost  its  rein\
  \  as  the  fire  crackers  detonated. Ululations seemed  to  emanate  from  everywhere.\
  \ Tins  and  any  other resounding  materials were  beat. I wished  I could  join\
  \  in and  beat  my  joviality  out  on  some  tin  but  my  mind  was  far from\
  \  the  heaving  and happy  mass of  bodies. My  gown swished  in the  cool evening\
  \  breeze  and  I shivered  slightly  as  I  thought of the  future. I  knew  a\
  \  moderate  number  of  my  seniors who  still  wallowed  the streets  searching\
  \  for a job. I could  not  face  living  off my  parents  again. Not  after  four\
  \  years  of sucking  off  their  meagre earnings. I wanted so  much to  give  back\
  \  what  they  had  given to  me. With  the attention  focused  on  the fireworks\
  \  that  went  on  and  on, I silently  slipped away  for a breath  of fresh air.\
  \  The  night  was  nowhere near being  young  when  they  finally  turned in  to\
  \  sleep.   \n\nI woke  up  with a  minor yet  nagging  headache. It was the  glass\
  \  of cheap  spirits I  had  been  forced  to  down by  my  elder  brother.  To\
  \  ease  away  the pain,  he  had  said of what was my supposed vacation turning\
  \ into a permanent stay . It not  helped  much  except  give  a feeling  of being\
  \  momentarily  light  headed.  Afterwards I had  felt  awful. I had  even thrown\
  \  up  and  for the  rest  of the party,  my  mouth had  remained  with  a  foul\
  \  taste. I  brushed  my  teeth  and  went  to  the  kitchen.  I  was poured a cup\
  \  of  steaming  coffee  by  my  understanding  brother.  To  do  away  with the\
  \  hang  over,  his  eyes said. I took  it  quietly,  wondering  why  he  had  given\
  \  me  the beer  in the  first  place.  So  I would  have  a  hangover  then  later\
  \  I could  drink  a cup  of coffee  to  do  away  with it.  It  seemed absurd \
  \ to  me.  Even in  the gloomy  look  of  things, I was somehow  hopeful.  Every\
  \  graduate  is  somehow  hopeful.  I attacked  my  job seeking  escapades  with\
  \  a zeal but  there  were  no  jobs  in  my  country. I had  to stay in South Africa\
  \ with my brother though it was a difficult task to leave my parents. \n\n\u2019\
  \ You  can  be  working  at  my  club  in  Rosebank  as  a  waitress  for the  meantime,\
  \  I could  connect  you  to  my boss, hey  it  is  better  than  spending  your\
  \ days gallivanting  up  and  down the  streets of Soweto. I am  not saying  you\
  \  will  not  find  a  job. You  will but  in  the  meantime  you  need this  \u2019\
  , said  Mpho  the guy  who shares  a room  with  my  brother.On my first stay I\
  \ was confounded of how they divided the room  into  two using  a  curtain  so \
  \ they  can  save  money on  rent  which is the  case  with many of Johannesburg\
  \ tenants.  I knew  he  was  making a point  so  I decided  to  go  with him  even\
  \ though  working  at  a  club  would  raise  many  eyebrows  of  many who knew\
  \ my  strict  Christian  upbringing. \n\nThe  next  day  we  set  off to  Mpho\u2019\
  s  workplace  using  public  transport  where  drivers hurling  insults was pretty\
  \  normal as  I  saw  Mpho  was imperturbable  towards  any  of the  crude  behaviour\
  \ exhibited by  these drivers,  seeing  how  terrified  I  was  Mpho  warned  that\
  \  as times  passes  I  will find  all the  havoc  captivating.   \n\n\nI looked\
  \  fearfully  at  the  large  building  ahead  of us,  the  place  scented of class.\
  \  Mpho  smiled encouragingly  at  me.  We  went to  the  boss  office,  the  man\
  \  looked  over  me  and  frowned.  \u2018She  looks like  a tenderfoot  to  me,\
  \  your sister  right?  I  looked at  Mpho  and  he  smiled apologetically  at \
  \ me. With  a resigned smile,  I  turned to  face  my  new  job  and  my  new  life\
  \  in  this big  city  of jovial people  with  a  new found  courage."
