Text: "I' m not sure when this journey began... Before I fell in love or after. The\
  \ only point I can tell you with assurance is that it twisted in a very unpredictable\
  \ way. Some of the most romantic readers, who watched Titanic or The Notebook for\
  \ a hundred million times could observe - it's freaking destiny, those who don't\
  \ believe in all these love - related stuff would just throw a sharp reproach -...oh,\
  \ it's so sweet. Yes, guys, I'm going to melt your hearts!\n Barcelona. Vicki Christina\
  \ Barcelona. Did you watch this melodrama? Honestly, it doesn't matter, because\
  \ I had my own Barcelona story. To begin with, it was a cold and snowy winter day,\
  \ in the middle of February. Snowflakes painted outside the window tracery patterns.\
  \ Yes, I like to book tours beforehand. It was then, when I accidentally chose to\
  \ visit Spain those summer. \nBut I didn't even expect that I would go there not\
  \ only to see Sagrada Familia from a perspective of a tiny tourist standing right\
  \ in front of this massive and fascinating architectural project, but also with\
  \ an ingenuous hope in my heart to see those ocean eyes.\nNever expected to have\
  \ an Internet crush, I was the one who got trapped. By accident, or maybe it was\
  \ fortune? Since the day I saw his picture on my Instagram feed, I couldn't stop\
  \ thinking about our imaginary relationship, that I have already drawn in my mind.\
  \ And, the point was, that he lived in Barcelona.\nYou can only imagine my eagerness!\n\
  \ Finally, enchanting Spain! I was completely ready to meet the love of my life.\
  \ I' ve even learned some Spanish words and the whole lyrics of the \"Despacito\"\
  \ song, read approximately a tonne of guides on Barcelona and invented a new way\
  \ how to style my hair in a specially cute manner. I travelled by bus, so I had\
  \ a chance to enjoy all the beauty of the local nature. On my way I visited a lot\
  \ of interesting places, which left a mark in my heart and beautiful photos on my\
  \ phone. Empuriabrava or the Spanish Venice is really very popular among yachters\
  \ and a peaceful spot to get some beach vibes, because the water there is incredibly\
  \ transculent and sheer, with a light shade of the Tiffany Blue.\nIn Lloret de Mar\
  \ I felt like a mermaid in the underwater wonderland, because of the colorful fish\
  \ having a voyage right beside our yacht. Mr Gonzales, the capitan of our humble\
  \ vessel, long- bearded and with this infectious type of laughter, always threw\
  \ some bread in the waters to attract more and more sea creatures. To be honest,\
  \ for a moment I even saw an Aquaman passing by and winking. Or maybe it was just\
  \ my imagination seasoned with a glass of champagne...\nHow many times am I going\
  \ to mention Barcelona in story? - One more is for sure! Barcelona! I felt it's\
  \ unique atmosphere with the first step I had taken, with a first breath and at\
  \ the first glance or still at the second, when I took off my sunglasses. Gothic\
  \ quarter impressed me particularly when I imagined all the life in a full swing\
  \ some centuries ago. I like to catch the feeling of antiquity in such places, it\
  \ always touches your soul strings...people, their stories, lives, pain, joy...\
  \ Stories no one will ever tell you, but which can only be felt.\nI saw him in every\
  \ passer-by. I was peering into the motley crowd in hope to meet him...\nThe day\
  \ was over, my last day and chance in Barcelona. It was a cozy evening, street musicians\
  \ were playing salsa...and I started to dance with all the passion I had inside.\
  \ I haven't met my love this time, but I have found something deeper and more important,\
  \ a new crush for a lifetime. You can effortlessly guess that it is Spain!\n\nP.S.\
  \ When I returned back home, the truth exposed. He lived in Madrid, not in Barcelona...So,\
  \ Madrid, I'm going to drive you crazy. And I do have a driver's license."
