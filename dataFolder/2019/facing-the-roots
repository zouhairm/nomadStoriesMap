Text: "S\xE3o Paulo is one of the greatest cities in the world. Not only because of\
  \ the huge population it has, but because of its diversity in any ways a person\
  \ can imagine. Besides all this greatness, S\xE3o Paulo is also my barely known\
  \ birthplace. When I was born, my mother decided to move into a smaller and calmer\
  \ city in the southern part of the state of Minas Gerais when I was just 8 months\
  \ old, turning my hometown somewhere I would pass by from time to time. And it was\
  \ a shocking difference. My family went from a city of millions to other ofa little\
  \ more than a few thousands.\nBut the destiny interveined and last December was\
  \ a magical month because, I was close to turn 28 and I had the oportunity to travel\
  \ there and finally behold with my own eyes some places I only had heard about before.\n\
  On my first day I went to a region called Liberdade, a single neighborhood that\
  \ shows that S\xE3o Paulo is a sample of the entire world in just one place. When\
  \ I walked the streets of Liberdade I felt like being in Japan while people, that\
  \ were mostly immigrants walking by spoke in their native language.\nLater that\
  \ day I visited a micro restaurant with a truly Italian recipe for pizzas in a totally\
  \ different part of town called Santa Cec\xEDlia.\nOne of the highest points of\
  \ that travel was realizing the dream of going to a Comic Con Experience with a\
  \ full costume, meeting people from all over the country, pretending to be our favorite\
  \ characters and above all, meeting the artists that made our lives what they are\
  \ today literarily speaking.\nOn the fourth day I had the chance to walk by the\
  \ well known Avenida Paulista, a really large and long avenue that has some of the\
  \ best panoramic views from the area, some museums like MASP (S\xE3o Paulo Art Museum)\
  \ and even Japan House, a tribute to Japanese history as well as to the technological\
  \ advances, being them in image, sound or fashion. Across the avenue is possible\
  \ to visit Casa das Rosas, an old patrimony of the city, that is home to a museum\
  \ that encourages new writers and that has a beautiful garden with a great variety\
  \ of roses from around the world. The last two did not have an entrance fee.\nThe\
  \ last of my five days there  was the most personal. It started with skipping breakfast\
  \  and going straight to the most famous, traditional and simplistic dish from S\xE3\
  o Paulo, the mortadela sandwich, bought in Mercado Municipal, a huge fair with all\
  \ kinds of food and ingredients, that is known countrywide for its variety.\nLater\
  \ in the same day I got to visit the Bank in wich my parents worked and met, leading\
  \ to their marriage and myself as well. I got to see the same places they went when\
  \ they were dating, and it was even nicer because I went with my girlfriend that\
  \ I met at work.\nIt is possible to understand how amazed I was during this trip,\
  \ but I am not astonished enough to forget the bad parts of town, the historical\
  \ buildings damaged by vandals, the dangerous streets from downtown and the huge\
  \ amount of people walking by everywhere you go, but sadly this is natural and happening\
  \ everywhere.\nWhen I left I kept thinking how I wanted to stay, or go back again\
  \ next year, visit other parts of this non-stopping living mechanism.\nS\xE3o Paulo\
  \ is a city full of culture,interesting places, gentle people, good food and it\
  \ is easy to notice that you do not need a lot of money to enjoy its options, you\
  \ just need comfortable shoes and if you want, a good companion to share this amazing\
  \ experience that is visiting a place that can be considered the heart of Brazil."
