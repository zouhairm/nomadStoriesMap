Text: "During the past four years I\u2019ve done a vast amount of time studying in\
  \ obtaining knowledge about vegan nutrition.  Along the way I have created a few\
  \ different blogs for all my vegan foodie followers. Together we have created a\
  \ safe environment for vegans and non-vegans to explore different Vegan options\
  \ around Southern California.  Not only have I been able to go to many different\
  \ places around Southern California but I\u2019m also been able to blog while traveling.\
  \  I have created a judgment free zone for everyone to be able to enjoy cultures\
  \ and lifestyles along with the food that that culture presents.  I have been studying\
  \ the language of Italian and have been planning a trip to Italy to explore everything\
  \ vegan they have to offer. As you know Italy is famous for their pasta and their\
  \ mozzarella.  As I was writing a post for a blog today I came across this 14 day\
  \ trip all expenses paid to Portugal and this immediately sparked my attention because\
  \ my family is from Portugal and Spain and I would love to see what amazing food\
  \ they have over there. It would be a dream come true for a trip to be completely\
  \ paid for because my blog and I have so much to offer. Not very many people travel\
  \ the world and get to blog about different vegan foods. Not many people have the\
  \ time or the money so I very much would love this trip."
