Text: 'In my own story, I travel to the mayor part of the world, I achievement to
  meet new people, new culture, a new world that I don''t know, and that could be
  a good experience for me, ''cause I could learn about others societies , about their
  own form thinking, their religion , and so on.


  But sincerely, I want begin to travel ''cause I never travel get out of my country
  , or my own city , I know about the world , or a little bit , only ''cause I  read
  some information in a book, o ''cause I saw a documentary about that country , for
  example , Ingland, I about that country , only for the books, history books, about
  Tv programs.


  Only I want to win this travel ''cause it could be a great experience to talk for
  the future, and I don''t know, it could be the beginning to search a job , my dream
  job, ''cause this time of experience''s allow young people like me to have a open
  mind, be best person, in all aspects , and propose more and better projects, that
  can make us grow as people, and also as workers or in any field in which we want
  to develop'
