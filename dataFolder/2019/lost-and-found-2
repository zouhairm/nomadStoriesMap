Text: "It is said, that your best experiences in life happen when you least expect\
  \ them. I did not believe in it until I had my best accident ever!\nI did my high\
  \ school from a boarding school in Himachal Pradesh (the mountain capital of India).\
  \ There I met two strange girls (my current Best friends). These girls had had different\
  \ life experiences which were very absurd for me. Having come from a protected family,\
  \ hearing their stories of backpacking across India intrigued me. And eventually,\
  \ they managed to inculcate this passion in me as well. One summer we planned to\
  \ take a trip together. But it turned out to be something completely unexpected\
  \ and the most memorable experience till date.\nWe started from Shimla and had to\
  \ go to Tata Pani which is known to have a natural hot spring and from there continue\
  \ our journey towards Dharamshala. We were travelling on a low budget so at that\
  \ point could only afford a local bus. Unfortunately or fortunately, we ended up\
  \ taking the wrong bus. Instead of Tata Pani, we landed on a bus to Narkanda and\
  \ realized the same when it was too late. We asked the driver to drop us to the\
  \ nearest bus stand where we could take the appropriate bus but he informed us that\
  \ we were now in the rural area which doesn\u2019t have bus stands, we could get\
  \ down randomly and wait for a bus to cross, which according to him should happen\
  \ every 20 minutes. We took his advice and got down. But this was not it, there\
  \ was more to unfold. We waited for a bus for 2 hours until the realization started\
  \ sinking in that we have now stranded in the middle of nowhere. There was also\
  \ a network issue and our phones were of no use. It was still bearable because I\
  \ was with my girl squad and their constant chattering and lame jokes kept my morale\
  \ high. Finally, we decided to walk and look for a bus stand or atleast a place\
  \ to crash. After walking for a few kilometres, we reached a small tea stall which\
  \ was run by an old man. We asked for his help and was told that we were close to\
  \ Kufri, and if we kept walking in the same direction, we could reach the bus stand\
  \ (if you have travelled in Indian hilly regions you would know that the definition\
  \ of \u2018close\u2019 for the locals is not the same as others). On questioning\
  \ him further, he added that the usual road will take us about 7 hours, instead,\
  \ we should take a shortcut which would save us time but would involve difficult\
  \ trek routes.\nThree of us were really fond of trekking and that place seemed very\
  \ beautiful too. So we thanked the old man and started our trek. We walked for 12\
  \ kilometres through forests, villages, farms and finally took a break after reaching\
  \ a hilltop, where we rested for a while. The view was beautiful, with greenery\
  \ and apple orchards around us. There, we ate and recollected our school memories.\
  \ when we noticed that there was another mountain in front of us which was probably\
  \ the highest peak in that area.  We couldn\u2019t help but imagine how incredible\
  \ the view would be from there and what lay behind it, so even though we were completely\
  \ exhausted, we decided to climb that peak too. And I think that was a great decision\
  \ because it was definitely the most beautiful view I had ever seen. The peak was\
  \ covered with white flowers everywhere. In the front, we could see the snow-capped\
  \ Himalayas and on the right, the blooming apple orchards and on the left, the perfectly\
  \ planned set of terrace farming. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. That climb was\
  \ worth it. We then sat there for hours just adoring what was possibly a small glimpse\
  \ of heaven. \nThat entire day I kept thinking that it was the worst trip of my\
  \ life and how I will always regret it. Until the last minute. the tables had turned\
  \ and it ended up being the most memorable trip and the best accident I have had."
