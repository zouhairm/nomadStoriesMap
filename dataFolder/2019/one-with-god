Text: "From April 2017 to October 2018 I volunteered for a year and a half for my\
  \ church in Portugal. My main goal was to teach others about God and Jesus Christ,\
  \ and to help people better the quality of their lives through a belief in God.\
  \ It was without a doubt, the most special year and a half of my life. I saw so\
  \ many miracles, as one often does when they put God above all else. I, through\
  \ God, was able to help bring families back together. I, through God, helped people\
  \ overcome serious addictions such as alcohol and smoking. I, through God, helped\
  \ people understand the possibility of forgiving others and themselves because God\
  \ first forgave us. I, through God, helped a couple get married after they had been\
  \ waiting for years. I through God, found another family in Portugal. And I, through\
  \ God, found the love of my life in Portugal.\n\nThere is nothing that more fully\
  \ contributes to a devouring passion than selflessness. As I sought to forget about\
  \ my life back home, I grew to love so many people in a way only achieved by a sincere\
  \ devotion to one's well being. I sacrificed everything I could for them- and I\
  \ did so with a hope of their happiness. And then that year and a half ended and\
  \ it was time to go home. I may have physically left Portugal, but a huge part of\
  \ my heart was left there. \n\nThis is a story of how I get my heart back. It is\
  \ a story of finally being reunited with people who mean the world to me. It is\
  \ a story of interviewing those people I helped find God, and I discover the miracles\
  \ they found as they embarked on a spiritual journey that changed their lives. It\
  \ is maybe more importantly, a story of how I begin to understand why helping other\
  \ people to find God helped me to find Him, too."
