Text: "After much deliberation and planning we decided to travel to Agra, for the\
  \ Monsoon Road trip.\n\nDAY 1 : Surat to Ahmedabad\nWe started late from Surat on\
  \ my i20 and drove towards Udaipur, Dead at night we got a good deal at a hotel\
  \ called Carefour '' . in Ahmedabad 250kms from Surat. \n\nDAY 2 : Ahmedabad to\
  \ Ajmer.\nThe room provided a wonderful view of Ahmedabad ringroad early morning.\
  \ \nGetting refreshed we started early and drove on to one of the best highways\
  \ I have driven so far. This route simply merges with mountains. A wonderful refreshing\
  \ view. The sky was surprisingly clear but the greenery all around was amazing.Before\
  \ reaching Ajmer we decided to take a detour to a place called Shreenathji near\
  \ Udaipur. However the detour was of no use because we were getting late for ajmer.\
  \ However the route was awesome. When we stopped , we could feel the wind and the\
  \ rhythm that it generated in the fields all around us. The mountains and the grasslands\
  \ all offered an exquisite view. The highway twisted and turned. We came across\
  \ large and great mountains in the back ground. The road to Ajmer was splendid and\
  \ we were expecting to drive through the mountains. Numerous beautiful scenery.\
  \ We passed picturesque areas.The next part of the day was a bit weird. We were\
  \ extremely lucky to find a nice cosy place to stay in Ajmer. A lady showed us the\
  \ room and there was a restaurant right at the front of it. They provided us some\
  \ superb food for the night.\nIt was indeed a cold night and after a very long day\
  \ and some great food , I don't know what happened at night.\n\nDAY :3 Our main\
  \ plannof the day was to visit KHWAJA GARIB NAWAZ dargah. It was near by so we were\
  \ relaxing at hotel and our next destination was Pushkar which was our next day\
  \ plan and was about 50kms from Ajmer. We roam around the city of Ajmer and were\
  \ visiting different place of Ajmer we had some good non veg food in Ajmer. \n\n\
  DAY 4: Ajmer to Pushkar. We began the day lazily (that was a mistake). After a lazy\
  \ stroll around Ajmer roaming around the Local market, we had some pretty ordinary\
  \ breakfast at an extraordinary price. It took 1 hour to reach Ajmer we checked\
  \ in a nice hotel in the centre of Pushkar. Hotel staff informed as about the fair(mela)\
  \ in Pushkar which last for 1 week they asked us to see it once in a life time so\
  \ we planned for it next day. The 3 kms radious of pushkar is vegetarian and dry\
  \ you dont get no veg items in this 3 kms radious but u have plenty of multicuisine\
  \ veg restaurants nearby which is really awsome.\n\nDAY 5: We woke up early in the\
  \ morning on day 5 as we had to cover a large distance to reach Agra. We had a plan\
  \ to reach Jaipur and stay there for a day just to explore so in the morning we\
  \ checked out hotel and had a breakfast and went to see fair. There were lots of\
  \ people the main centre of attraction was horses of Rajasthan. They had a big horse\
  \ market sort of all breeds we enjoyed it for a while and then we left from Pushkar\
  \ as we had to reach Jaipur. We planned to have some local lunch on higway and we\
  \ found one vegetarian hotel( dhaba). Eventhough he took lot of time to prepare\
  \ food but food was ultimate worth waiting just as perfect as home food. We had\
  \ our lunch and left for Jaipur in the evening got a hotel and relaxed in the room\
  \ ordered food in the hotel itself and slept early.\n\nDAY 6: We woke up early had\
  \ our break fast and checked out our hotel and went for a city tour. I wanted to\
  \ see old Jaipur so we went there had some local shopping and food and left for\
  \ Agra. It was a 4 hour drive to Agra from Jaipur. We reached Agra in the night."
