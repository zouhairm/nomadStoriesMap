  Well on my way on the great ocean road, I didn't meet anyone of them. I found serenity
  in the ocean with deep sea blue water throughout the road. Endless. All the shouts,
  all the chaos, all the fights in your head are won by the roar of the waves and
  you turn into a calm and composed creature for a while. It's a stretch of 80KMs
  worth of eye soothing road lined at the edge of the lower land piece of beautiful
  Australia. An example that says that truly teaches that like life, you need to enjoy
  the journey rather than the destination. For the journey is most beautiful part
  of the travel, no matter how beautiful your destination is going to be. A paradise
  for drivers, it has 12 Apostles, one of which you might have definitely seen in
  one of the wallpapers. With breathtaking views, me and my friends just remembered
  how sudden the plan was made for this trip as we hired a car in 30 mins and went
  away on this trip with Camping tents and sleeping bags. We went and spent entire
  day on the road, on the great ocean road and we still hadn't enough of the ocean.
  I didn't expect to find the apostles, the beauty of the road so attractive and ravishing
  sliver of nature.
