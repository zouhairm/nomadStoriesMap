Text: "Soon after my semester exam, friends had all flown back to their home and left\
  \ me behind. An urge to traveling sparks inside me since having a good 6 weeks of\
  \ school break in front of me. While doing my research online, Naples, Italy stood\
  \ out from the rest and intrigue me deeply with its ancient history of Pompeii to\
  \ its stunning coastline of the neighboring district of Amalfi. \n\nHaving not been\
  \ to Italy, Naples gave me a hostile feeling of being in an ASEAN country, with\
  \ its messy environment and unorganized traffic. But my prejudices soon proofed\
  \ me wrong, in fact, I have totally in love in this wonderful place soon after spending\
  \ some time here.\n\nExploring the neighborhood of Spanish Quarter seems to go back\
  \ in time to the \u201990s. Squeezing yourself through Narrow alleys, hearing loud\
  \ merchants and smelling the intense aroma of espresso becomes a cycle as you dash\
  \ through the crowded market. Slowed down my phase whilst roaming in this hectic\
  \ city and been to the elevation of St.Elmo realized that how scenic and historical\
  \ the city really is.\n\nTook a train to Sorrento, a town located up in the beautiful\
  \ coastal cliff of Amalfi, unlike Naples, Sorrento has less busy traffic and much\
  \ cleaner as compared to Naples. Sorento has much to offer other than its well-known\
  \ Pottery, Porcelain, and Lemoncello. Took a public bus with an affordable price\
  \ to Positano, a town with a terrace built uniquely by the sheer cliff of the Amalfi\
  \ rugged coastline with a magnificent view of the turquoise blue Mediterranean Sea.\
  \ Decided to stay here for a night to catch of view of its beautiful sunset & Positano\u2019\
  s evening lights along those terraces.\n\nAs expected, Pompeii looks exactly as\
  \ it shows on TV, once a thriving city for the elites of the Roman Empire was well\
  \ preserved by the volcano ashes from Mt. Vesuvius that once destroyed it. Spent\
  \ a few hours walking around and appreciate this well-kept thousand years old civilization\
  \ and never forget to take some photos as a souvenir.  \n\nIn conclusion, my instantaneous\
  \ holiday plan turns out really great and full of wonders & adventures. I\u2019\
  ve met lots of cool travelers coming from all different sort of country and took\
  \ tons of great photos. To me, traveling is not only about joy, but more to experience\
  \ its journey & the indulgence of local\u2019s food, people & culture. A sentence\
  \ well said, \"The world is like a book, one who never travel reads only a page\"\
