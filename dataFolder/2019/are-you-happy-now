Text: "\"Where am I?\" I'm asking myself this question constantly now. \n\nShould\
  \ be an easy answer. I'm in a sandy, sleepy, small town called Todos Santos, in\
  \ Baja, Mexico. Two years ago, I fully dedicated five months to finding a remote\
  \ job so I could leave New York City to follow a boy down here. Have you ever tried\
  \ dating in New York... ? That \"lots of fish in the sea\" sentiment doesn't apply\
  \ to the Hudson and East Rivers. Dating wasn't the biggest issue, though. The life\
  \ I lived over my twelve years in Manhattan was fading away; my friends were settling\
  \ down, people were moving to the suburbs, or California, or wherever else New Yorkers\
  \ go when they've hit their limit. I wasn't interested in a life there that didn't\
  \ look like the one I'd loved; I wasn't interested in growing up. I became jaded\
  \ and complacent, and more importantly, my tastes had matured more rapidly than\
  \ my bank account, and Manhattan isn't friendly toward that dilemma. I'd always\
  \ grown up saying I would be a traveler, and felt like a failure for remaining so\
  \ stagnant in place. I needed a change, and a romance in Mexico with a van-living,\
  \ surfer boy from Montana was enticing for the adventure, and the escape into the\
  \ unknown. \n\nMy lifestyle now is sort of like being a retiree, expect I have a\
  \ full time job, and I'm thirty two, and I'm technically without a home (which is\
  \ a nice way to say homeless). I'm in Todos Santos with Jed for the winters, renting\
  \ a one-bedroom, outdoor kitchened, mosquito-infested beach house, and in the summers,\
  \ I'm living in my parents house on Long Island, for the first time since age 20.\
  \ TS has a whopping population of six thousand people, two thousand of which are\
  \ old, rich, white, US and Canadian expats. The irony of the fact that the L train\
  \ during rush hour is more diverse than the entirety of my foreign expedition is\
  \ not lost on me. I long for the L train, actually; shiny, smelly, hot, packed,\
  \ easy public transportation. God, it sounds like a fucking dream when I'm here.\
  \ Not that I really travel around much. Mostly I'm kind of by myself with my face\
  \ in my computer putting in ten hour work days while the rest of the young people\
  \ here, and there aren't many of them, are spending their days drinking margaritas,\
  \ numbing themselves from whatever life they ran from back in the States. And when\
  \ I'm not by myself working, it is impossible to leave the house without seeing\
  \ someone that I recognize. I miss my anonymity. I miss not having to have friendly,\
  \ dinner-long conversation with the local shopkeeper because we smiled at each other\
  \ once. Apparently, that's what happens in a small town. I miss the freedom of stomping\
  \ through a crowd in a sports bra and leggings without anyone noticing. I'm told\
  \ sports bras without shirts are too immodest for small town Mexico. \n\nThis country\
  \ is incredible, though. The cities are rich in culture, in pride, in food, and\
  \ dance, and intellectual pursuits, and color. So much beautiful, vibrant color\
  \ everywhere. \n\nIt's just this little plot. If you are seeking escape, my advice\
  \ is to not seek a culture built on just that. Everyone is lost. But I stay, because,\
  \ Jed. Love is a bitch. For anyone that pities single people, do not. Being single\
  \ is easy, it is so, so brilliantly easy. Learning to compromise your desires when\
  \ you have a key to the entire world (getting a remote job, I recommend)... now\
  \ I'll take everyone's pity. Gladly. \n\nI spend a lot of time daydreaming. I always\
  \ have; endlessly restless and eternally unfulfilled. But now my daydreams take\
  \ me through my own life. I hear the birds chirping and I see the sunlit sand and\
  \ palm trees in front of me, from my outdoor kitchen \"office,\" but in my mind\
  \ I see a city street. I see white buildings, not tall buildings, but beautifully\
  \ designed. I'm walking there, smiling. It's somewhere I've been. \n\n\"Where am\
  \ I?\" Is it Oslo, Sydney, Vienna, Paris? And when I was there, was I happy then?"
