  \ \nIt\u2019s a country filled with colour and wonder, and the opportunities to\
  \ explore it are endless. \n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard it all before\u2026 \u201C\
  You HAVE to do this, its LIFE CHANGING!\u201D. \_And you may have shrugged it off,\
  \ put it to the back of your mind, and thought \u201Cyeah, sure, one day.\u201D\
  \ But believe me when I say you will return from the Himalayas a different person.\
  \ You'll delve into the unknown, without a clue of what to expect. But it'll be\
  \ the best decision you've ever made.\n\nAny type of holiday in Nepal will leave\
  \ you gobsmacked. It\u2019s the views, the people and the culture. And leaving the\
  \ beautiful country, you may even shed a tear (or a thousand!) on the plane back\
  \ home. The trip will leave you mentally and physically fit, you\u2019ll be able\
  \ to take some time to switch off with everything else, and will return with a completely\
  \ different mindset - something I didn't expect.\n\nSo what makes it so amazing?\
  \ I went on a trek to Annapurna Base Camp with Alpine Ramble Treks and for me, this\
  \ was the most breathtaking 12 days of my entire life. Why? It's the people, the\
  \ environment, and challenge. Walking along a trail, with the guidance of a local\
  \ does not require exceptional skills. Being 19 and alone with an average gym schedule,\
  \ I was extremely nervous beforehand. But once I was there I saw people of all ages\
  \ and abilities, walking up and down mountains which instantly put me at ease. \n\
  \nThe people\nAs you walk from day to day, you pass by tea houses and lodges run\
  \ by families of the mountains. With no means of transport but by foot, and kilometres\
  \ between towns, life looks as hard as you can imagine. But, the welcoming environment\
  \ that you are placed in when stopping from time to time at these places, is overwhelming.\
  \ By the end of the trip, you will feel lighter, warmer and extremely grateful for\
  \ the life you live. \_When talking to one Nepalese man, he told me he leaves the\
  \ lodge at 4:30 am with a heavy basket filled with supplies on his back, and arrives\
  \ at the Annapurna Base Camp by sundown, having traveled five times the amount I\
  \ did in just one day. It really puts things into perspective along the trip, and\
  \ the six hours you walked that day becomes almost insignificant.\n\nThe environment\n\
  You\u2019ve seen it in movies and pictures, but that doesn\u2019t do it justice.\
  \ There is no way to describe what it\u2019s like to walk through a valley, with\
  \ waterfalls and a forest on one side, and stunning views of the mountains on the\
  \ other. Rain, hail or shine the country provides spectacular beauty with every\
  \ step. And it\u2019s not just the mountains, it\u2019s the cool breeze running\
  \ past you, the light rain falling off your shoulder, the amazing species of animals\
  \ talking amongst themselves. You\u2019ll be walking up a hill and just as your\
  \ mind starts to complain, you\u2019ll come across a line of cows, blocking the\
  \ way. Then you\u2019ll remember where you are, find a way to get around them (safely),\
  \ which isn\u2019t easy\u2026 and continue on with a new, focused mindset!\n\nThe\
  \ Challenge\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t struggle. I did. And that\u2019\
  s even more of a reason to go. Test your limits, challenge yourself. Yes, you will\
  \ be continuously walking, up and down on rocky, wet and muddy surfaces for hours\
  \ on end. But take a look around you. The scenery will blow your mind.  Every new\
  \ day is a new adventure, and you\u2019ll face different challenges and new situations\
  \ every hour. \n\nThe quality of life in Nepal compared to in Australia differs\
  \ immensely and for some of the poorest people in the world, they sure are the happiest.\
  \ So go - breathe it in, explore and take all Nepal has to offer. It's sure a leap\
  \ into the unknown, but sometimes the best things are found in the most unexpected\
  \ cirumstances. \n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\
