Text: "After getting back from Peterhof Palace, I decided to take a stroll to see\
  \ a palace that I realized I didn\u2019t book but wanted desperately to see. My\
  \ \u201Cerror\u201D of \u201Cbooking the wrong palace\u201D was proved later to\
  \ be wrong, though, because Catherine\u2019s Palace WAS on my \u201CDefinitely Must\
  \ See\u201D list. I had told the guide that I wanted to see Catherine\u2019s Palace\
  \ but I was unaware that I was not referring to the Hermitage, but the palace at\
  \ Tsarkoe Selo. In all my years of research, I thought Catherine\u2019s Palace and\
  \ the Hermitage were one in the same. The documentaries I watched seemed to interchange\
  \ the two names and never mentioned Peter building the Winter Palace (the Hermitage).\
  \ They seemed to mention Catherine the Great and the Winter Palace in the same breath\
  \ calling it the Winter Palace or her \u201CHermitage\u201D; Catherine\u2019s Palace\
  \ was referred to only as Tsarskoe Selo.\n\nKnowing I made the error, I took a walk\
  \ because I could see the Hermitage from my hotel, across the river. It was a 20-minute\
  \ walk to get to the bridge and cross it. I walked behind the Hermitage to see Palace\
  \ Square and go inside the entrance my guide had previously pointed out. I walked\
  \ the square marveling at the architecture. When I stepped inside, I got a map of\
  \ the Palace from the booth but decided to relax and aimlessly stroll. Catherine,\
  \ I knew, had collected so much art for it that you could spend a literal lifetime\
  \ in the palace if I wasn\u2019t careful, but I knew someone would find me \U0001F609\
  . I wandered room to room and just took in the art and scenery, then found myself\
  \ on the main staircase with a statue of what look like Athena standing guard at\
  \ the top. I marveled at the gilded statues, golden accents along the walls, and\
  \ the detail of the ceiling painting. At one point, I crossed the skywalk between\
  \ buildings, feeling that I was walking the actual path that Peter had and felt\
  \ as if I were looking out his eyes over the Neva. I walked through the dance hall\
  \ remembering royal balls that Elizabeth threw and how Peter III was portrayed in\
  \ a documentary having played pranks on the guests from the balcony above.\n\nI\
  \ originally thought I couldn\u2019t take photos since photography was forbidden\
  \ inside Peterhof. When I realized that I could, just not with flash, I started\
  \ snapping away in the ballrooms and the throne room. I looked for things that my\
  \ guide had mentioned in side conversation but quickly realized I was not keeping\
  \ track of the rooms. I was truly wandering aimlessly, not even using the map. I\
  \ found the peacock room my guide had told me about but couldn\u2019t find the clock\
  \ she mentioned to make sure I see. I decided it was time to go back as my ankle\
  \ was killing me from all the days walking.\n\nI crossed the bridge and paused at\
  \ all the landmarks, such as obelisks dedicated to seaman traversing the Neva and\
  \ Gulf of Finland, during the time of Peter the Great, as well as the Russian Stock\
  \ Exchange. I stopped at a bust of Alexander Pushkin outside the Russian Academy\
  \ of Literature; someone had placed flowers at the base and I paused to honor his\
  \ memory. Knowing the impact his death at the age of 27, in a duel, had on the country\
  \ I wanted to take a moment to remember my first Pushkin story, \u201CThe Stationmaster.\u201D\
  \n\nAll the sudden, I realized the next day was my last in St. Petersburg and I\
  \ had yet to get a souvenir. I walked across the next bridge and stopped at the\
  \ shop marked on my map. I bought a coffee cup with all the Romanov rulers on it\
  \ with the family crest and a Matryoshka doll of Nicholas II, Catherine, and Peter\
  \ and walked back across to the hotel. When I sat down at the hotel restaurant,\
  \ I checked my pedometer; Peterhof, two bridges, the Hermitage, Palace Square and\
  \ part of Vasilievsky Island had amounted to 21,546 steps. No wonder why my ankle\
  \ hurt!"
