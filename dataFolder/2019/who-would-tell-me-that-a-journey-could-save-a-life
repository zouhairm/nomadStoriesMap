Text: "Sometimes we live in an atmosphere that couldn't be more toxic to our dreams\
  \ and expectations. The pressure to reach the sometimes unrealistic expectations\
  \ that society put on young people, is suffocating and make us depressed and unhappy.\n\
  \nThat situation was the one that I was suffering for more than a year. Like a swallow\
  \ that needs to fly away. Feel the fresh air of new adventures and places. I was\
  \ trapped in a cage.\n\nPrecisely the swallow, is a bird that is a natural traveller\
  \ flying more than 3.500 km every year, but that is always coming back no matter\
  \ what to his roots, his home.\n\nIt was in a moment of revelation (this kind of\
  \ thing that only happens in the movies while I was looking for a swallow tattoo)\
  \ when I realise that what I needed to be happy again is to come back to my maternal\
  \ roots. I was happy in M\xE1laga, the paradise for the Nobel prize writer Vicente\
  \ Aleixandre, where my father\u2019s family is native, but I need it to know for\
  \ the first time the green paradise that is Galicia and more precisely Ourense,\
  \ where part of my DNA will always be stuck by thanks to my mother's side.\n\nI\
  \ quit my job and leave my master studies in the middle of the way. An unpopular\
  \ decision for a massive part of my family and friends, but it was a necessary step\
  \ to cross the skies looking for Mi\xF1a Terra Galega. A commitment that involves\
  \ me into a nine-month journey of self-discovery to reveal my true happiness.\n\n\
  I can\u2019t really choose among the massive appeals that Galicia has shown me during\
  \ this past year. It has this stuck in time feeling, that make you feel warm like\
  \ you have been there in another life. \n\nThe rain that is Galicia\u2019s best\
  \ friend (or worst enemy depends on who you ask) impregnate the territory with this\
  \ refreshing smell of wet grass, the sound of the water running down in every river\
  \ or the waterfalls (the Cascada del \xC9zaro in Dumbr\xEDa is a must) and feed\
  \ this little plants that grows between the bricks in every building that you can\
  \ see, although sometimes it feels that nature is trying to take it back his territory\
  \ slowing consuming houses, old churches and ruins. \n\nBecause Galicia sincerely\
  \ has always felt that belongs more to mother nature than to the human race. \n\n\
  Is precisely this enigmatic battle between the old, the new and nature, which impregnates\
  \ the DNA of Galicia. I would even say, that more than a battle is a dance. This\
  \ flirting between the elements is radiating from every pore of the people of Galicia.\
  \ This strong inner energy of hardworking, fighting for your dreams, embrace your\
  \ own nature and qualities but also this fantastic and soulful thing of always being\
  \ an explorer. \n\nIt can be the breathtaking mountain of Santa Tecla, the cliff\
  \ of Loiba or merely the whole Costa da Morte, that a Galicia is always looking\
  \ forward to pushing you through their unique nature and culture into the unknown.\
  \ To help you surpass your fears and open your mind like never before.\n\nI glad\
  \ that I decided to take a step back in the busy modern life and embrace my northern\
  \ roots. To be able to balance both parts of my soul (the south and the north) and\
  \ be able to rediscover myself. And start to feel that the sparkle of life is still\
  \ shining brightly.\n\nNever renounce to changes, they can save a life."
