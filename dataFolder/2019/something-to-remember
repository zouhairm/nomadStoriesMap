Text: People often say that the unknown is not something reliable, but the unknown
  has given me many good experiences. My school offered, to students on grade eleven,
  exchange scholarships, so I took the test, and I passed! Canada was my destination,
  my first contact with another country. I was able to learn about a new culture,
  I met several people, learned a different language and I made so many friendships.
  I was welcomed by a host family, they were wonderful to me. I had access to a different
  educational system. And I confess that at first I was a little afraid to go out
  there without knowing what I could find, because everything was new, unknown, and
  I did not know what would happen and how it would go, but it sure was worth it.
  I stayed there for five months, and Canada became my second home, an incredible
  country with very welcoming people, and a beautiful culture. I am sure that I will
  never forget any of the moments I lived there, I will always carry with me all the
  learning, and all the lived experiences, because good moments are meant to be remembered.
  And now the unknown is not a threat to me anymore, it is a chance, an opportunity
  to live differently, to learn. The unknown is a chance to live more!
