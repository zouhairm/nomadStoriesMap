Text: "Though this was the second time I had got up and gone to the counter to ask,\
  \ I was careful not to sound combative. It helped that I was not, in fact, concealing\
  \ any anger at the situation; I was quite simply confused. \n\n\"It\u2019s all good,\"\
  \ one of the men responded, as he had the first time. And once again, he said a\
  \ few words in Arabic to a colleague and continued as he was.\n\nI returned to my\
  \ seat next to Olivia, my partner at the time, wondering if I actually needed that\
  \ second falafel wrap. I shared with her my bemusement, and the uncanniness of the\
  \ situation awoke in both of us a curiosity that soon displaced our fatigue. We\
  \ moved onto one of the tables outside, lit a cigarette and waited, the neon white\
  \ light from the counter subjecting the expanse of the wide Berlin footpath to unforgiving\
  \ scrutiny.\n\nThis section of Sonnenallee, once known as little Beirut, has in\
  \ recent years become a centre for Berlin\u2019s various Arabic-speaking populations.\
  \ Indeed, walking down the street one can tally up half the flags of the Arab league.\
  \ Although at first glance it seems to be a tight-knit community that has successfully\
  \ carved out a portion of the city for itself, this ethnic enclave houses divisions,\
  \ the determining factors of which are not only nationality and ethnicity, but time.\
  \ A friend of Olivia and I\u2019s, an architecture student at one of Berlin\u2019\
  s large universities, had completed a research project on Sonnenallee during which\
  \ she discovered that one of the most well-known and established restaurants on\
  \ the strip had a long and documented history of bullying and intimidating newer\
  \ immigrants who tried to open businesses in the area.\n\n\"C\u2019mon, let\u2019\
  s ask one more time and then just go,\" suggested Olivia. It was almost 3 am, surely\
  \ close to closing time, and the excitement of the situation\u2019s ambiguity had\
  \ worn off. We finished our cigarettes and approached the counter once more.\n\n\
  This time the man with whom I spoke turned and yelled someone\u2019s name. From\
  \ the kitchen at the back of the restaurant emerged a young man we had not yet encountered\
  \ that night.\n\n\"What\u2019s the problem?\" he asked.\n\nI explained that there\
  \ was no problem, I was just confused as I had ordered and paid for a falafel wrap\
  \ which I had not received, a fact that had been neither affirmed nor denied by\
  \ the other staff members.\n\n\"There\u2019s no problem,\" he responded, before\
  \ turning away and going back towards the kitchen.\n\nJust as Olivia and I were\
  \ expressing our mutual bewilderment, the man I had originally ordered from came\
  \ around through the adjacent dining area, peered out and ushered us inside. Olivia\
  \ and I looked at each other, and though unsure of where we were going, followed\
  \ as he directed us into the staff only area.\n\nOnly then did we see the table,\
  \ platters of chicken and lamb, hummus, yoghurt, salad, and pickles abound. Without\
  \ fanfare or pageantry, Olivia and I were handed containers of Ayran and invited\
  \ to sit. Each of the men then took their seats. It was indeed closing time.\n\n\
  The meal was eaten in silence, with only one flurry of basic questions breaking\
  \ the quietude.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" We asked.\n\n\"Iraq,\" responded one\
  \ of the men, the others confirming this with a gentle nod.\n\n\"Where are you from?\"\
  \ he reciprocated.\n\n\"Australia,\" we replied.\n\nI paused, then added, \"My father\
  \ is Jordanian,\" to smiles and nods no more or less enthusiastic than those that\
  \ preceded the statement.\n\nSharing a meal is so symbolically loaded in the Western\
  \ collective conscious that such experiences are difficult to portray without inducing\
  \ fantasies of cultural exchange or reconciliation, particularly if one still wants\
  \ to convey the pleasantness of the event in question, as I am here. What this meal\
  \ lacked in conversation, it also lacked in unease. It was as if everyone there\
  \ understood that the spread was simply the mens\u2019 reward to themselves at the\
  \ end of a long day, and our invitation nothing more than compensation for them\
  \ having forgotten my order."
