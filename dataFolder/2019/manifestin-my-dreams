Text: "I was traveling across all Europe and it all started two years ago. I visited\
  \ different cultures over the Balkan regions and Southern Europe and it was more\
  \ than fun to live as their traditional ways. I ve visited almost all major cities\
  \ in Europe ( Belgrade, Zagreb, Split, Herceg Novi, Munchen, Wien, London, Nice,\
  \ Monte Carlo, Skopje) and in some of them I ve lived for couple of months. So it\
  \ was funny how my whole story manifested till the day I ve deacided to do things\
  \ for myself and resolve other wishes. I would began about specialty of Skopje in\
  \ Macedonia where two religions clashe in one city so u are able to see different\
  \ faces of city, I have special note for Macedonia people whatever they believe\
  \ at u are most welcoming people that I ve met. Later travels took me to Serbia\
  \ to Nis where i just stopped to eat some grill from outaspace and i got rested\
  \ with nice music and comfy bed. In the morning we headed to Belgrade where I found\
  \ my sanctuary for few days to get in the city flow, because I love balkan culture.\
  \ Next was Novi Sad it\u2019s beautiful new city, very cool for nightlife and all\
  \ services are cheap and very serving. So that was one part of my journey. At the\
  \ moment I am in New York City and it\u2019s kinda chilly so I would really liked\
  \ to enjoy your prize. Ty Filip"
