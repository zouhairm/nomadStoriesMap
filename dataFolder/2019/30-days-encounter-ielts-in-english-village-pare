Text: "In 2016, i went to English Village, it located in pare,  which is the sub-district\
  \ of Kediri city, East Java. \nI went there by train and it takes 6,5 hours from\
  \ my hometown to Kediri station. Furthermore, i used a local transportation called\
  \ angkot. Then i arrived in english village after 1 hours. Fortunatelly,  i didn't\
  \ get car-sick. \nI would like to tell you about English Village. It is a village\
  \ named Tulungrejo. Actually it is beatufiul village. Because it has beautiful culture,\
  \ view, and other as well as there are many humble people. English village has a\
  \ long history. Although the name is english village, it is not really that there\
  \ are so many England's people. Actually, there are more than 150 English courses.\
  \ And what make i wonder is the tuthor that teach is not foreign or native. But\
  \ they are local people whose is proficient in english.  There are nothing expensive.\
  \ So i can save my money when i settle there. \nThis is my first time taking long\
  \ journey without friend. I went there by my self to prepare IELTS test. And I choose\
  \ Elfast course for my study place.  I take IELTS camp program because it is very\
  \ cheap. Just IDR 775,000 for a months as well as the dormitory. Elfast course is\
  \ one of the most big course in English village. It located at kemunig street. Actually\
  \ it is not really central of the village.  But i think elfast course is the best\
  \ course for study. Like a primary school,  elfast also has educational curriculum.\
  \ \nI encounter many friend from other country when i settle there. It means that\
  \ we have different culture such as minang, betawi, javanese and other. Therefore\
  \ we have differential background, we have same goal to get 6,5 band score in IELTS.\n\
  IELTS is not easy. But it become funny. Because i have many friend that have humor\
  \ sense. So every time they make me laugh out loud. \nIn conclusion, English Village\
  \ is the best place to study english"
