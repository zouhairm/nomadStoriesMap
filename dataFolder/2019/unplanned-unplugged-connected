Text: "The first time I met Sandrena was for a morning coffee, and the second time\
  \ I met Sandrena was for a road trip. I think that everyone should try road tripping\
  \ with a stranger at least once, pending the stranger is not a creep, which Sandrena\
  \ was not. With hours of tunes, rose-colored glasses, and a serious lack of planning,\
  \ Sandrena, my sister Dana, and I hit the highway to for a chick-trip to Big Sur.\
  \ \n\nBig Sur is off-the-grid, and camping there requires a booking months in advance\
  \ (something we had not arranged). Instead, we bought iron-on sea otter patches\
  \ at the ranger station and sweet-talked the ranger into giving us the inside scoop\
  \ on secret campsites. \"Go down the road. Keep going. And then turn, and go up\
  \ the hill. And just keeeeeeep going... you'll see a plot of land on the right.\
  \ If you leave now, you should make it there by sunset,\" he said. We lost cell\
  \ service 20 minutes later, and the hood of our car went up in smoke an hour after\
  \ that. Stranded on the side of the road with no way to communicate, we stress-ate\
  \ our last bag of chips, which seemed logical at the time but in hindsight could\
  \ have been our last supper.\n\nBut as the sun began to set, we were met with unexpected\
  \ good fortune: a Tarzan look-alike in a sports-car. After flagging down our new\
  \ roadside assistant, Tarzan (Tristan) diagnosed blown coolant hoses and macgyvered\
  \ a set of clamps from zip-ties to nurse our car down the hill. Tristan, Matt 1\
  \ (a drone videographer) and Matt 2 (a body painter) proceeded to invite us to camp\
  \ with them. They, too, were strangers on a road-trip and had met online only a\
  \ few hours prior. They claimed to be recreating a scene from Avatar by painting\
  \ Tristan blue and filming him rock climbing using a drone. On so many levels, the\
  \ story was suspicious, so the girls pow-wowed in the car to consider our options.\
  \ We came to the cautious decision that a serial killer would have spun a more enticing\
  \ story than body painting himself blue, plus he fixed our car and it was dark,\
  \ so what other choice did we have? Three became six.\n\nThirty minutes later and\
  \ safely down the hill, we found out that the geniuses that invited us to their\
  \ campsite had also not reserved a campsite. We tried to mooch spots from paying\
  \ campers in one campground, only to be chased off the site, and in a final act\
  \ of desperation, we sent Tristan into the woods. Somehow, it worked.  Christine\
  \ and Matt 3, a lovely couple in their 50s, offered us a plot next to their airstream.\
  \ They were on a weekend getaway for their anniversary, and somehow found it in\
  \ their hearts to take us in like six stray dogs. We gathered around their roaring\
  \ campfire and made friends quickly. Matt 3 poured us campfire cocktails, and we\
  \ connected-- truly connected. I can still hear Fleetwood Mac's 'Sara' through the\
  \ portable speakers, still taste the aperitif, still make out the shadows of Matt\
  \ and Christine slow dancing in the darkness. I can still feel the warmth of the\
  \ fire, a celebration of strangers and our serendipitous rendezvous. Our eight paths\
  \ had tangled into a hairball adventure, and here we were with no cell connection:\
  \ a motley crew of misfits. I went against my grain at every turn of this adventure.\
  \ I road tripped with a stranger, accepted help from Tarzan, believed in Tarzan\
  \ and the Matts, drank my first aperitif, and trusted in the universe. Most of all,\
  \ I felt more alive than ever."
