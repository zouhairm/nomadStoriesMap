Text: "The weather is humid and hot, the city is under massive construction, and the\
  \ population is largely diverse for such a small place. The land is lusciously green\
  \ decorated by nature with exotic succulents of various kinds; and as beautiful\
  \ as this exotic place is, the food is nothing to write home about for a vegetarian\
  \ such as myself. This is Panama City, Panama; a metropolis linking the Atlantic\
  \ and the Pacific Ocean in the Republic of Panama. A country in Central America\
  \ surrounded by Costa Rica, Columbia, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean.\
  \ Panama City is the capital and largest city in Panama; it is home to about 2.5\
  \ million people.\n\nAs I walked around Panama City enjoying my new surroundings,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but remember the feeling of caution that flooded my body\
  \ on the taxi ride from the airport to my hotel at 2:00 am after my arrival. The\
  \ feeling that this beautiful land was hiding something dark and sinister wouldn\u2019\
  t leave my conscious. After taking a tour, I thought maybe my intuition was sensing\
  \ the great divide here between the rich and the poor. I would later learn it was\
  \ much darker than I had imagined.\n\nBack in my hometown, Detroit, Michigan (U.S.),\
  \ I grew up in what we Americans call the Ghetto; to be specific, in my urban community\
  \ we call this urban collection of housing \u201CThe Hood\u201D. The hood is a spirit,\
  \ it is alive and vibrant within the community. Here where money is scarce we learn\
  \ to have fun without spending a dime. Adults play a card game of spades on the\
  \ front porch, while the children run through the fire hydrant. We don\u2019t have\
  \ much in the hood but we have each other. After being in the downtown area of Panama\
  \ City for most of my trip I had grown bored of the suit and tie atmosphere. I was\
  \ craving a more down to earth and vibrant experience. I thought to myself, \u201C\
  What better place to find such authenticity than the hood\u201D?  That is where\
  \ my story begins.\n\nMy friend and I set out on an adventure to figure out how\
  \ to get to the Ghetto of Panama City. It didn\u2019t take long before we were met\
  \ with defeat and disappointment. In an attempt to see the hood, I reached out to\
  \ an old friend of mine who is Panamanian living in New York. I tried pumping him\
  \ for advice on how to get out to the Ghetto of Panama. I noticed right away that\
  \ he was very crafty at dancing around my curiosity. Soon after he phoned me and\
  \ warned that it wasn\u2019t safe for us to go to the hood. he even suggested that\
  \ his family take us in and bring us out to ensure our safety. I thought \u201C\
  surely it couldn\u2019t be that bad\u201D; boy was I wrong! Later that same day\
  \ I inquired with Juan, the bartender at my hotel, about the hood. Juan was very\
  \ worried about us desiring to go to the hood; the hood is better known in these\
  \ parts as \u201Cthe slums\u201D. Juan went as far as to make us promise to never\
  \ to go to the hood. I asked him why and he said: \u201CThey will kidnap you and\
  \ cut out your organs for money, please don\u2019t go or my head is going to hurt\
  \ worrying about you!\u201D. My eyes got big; I took one look at my friend and turned\
  \ back to Juan. I pinky swore to him that we wouldn\u2019t go to the slums.\n\n\
  After Juan told me what the deeper issue was, I couldn\u2019t help but think of\
  \ all the young girls back in America who have been disappearing. I thought about\
  \ The death of 17-year-old Kendrick Johnson. Johnson was found murdered in his school\
  \ gym at Lowndes County High School rolled up in a gym mat with his organs removed.\
  \ It is very apparent that something very wrong is happening in the world and it\
  \ isn\u2019t isolated to third world countries. Sex trafficking is on-going issue\
  \ across nations and it appears that the black market of organs and slavery go hand\
  \ in hand with this."
