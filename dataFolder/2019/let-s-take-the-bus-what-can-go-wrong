Text: "Never try to cross the United States by bus.\n\n I am warning you!\n\nYour\
  \ 25 hours bus trip can easily turned in to a 48 hours nightmare. Uncountable buses\
  \ changes, no bath, no decent meal and good stories.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get back\
  \ to my teenage dream.\n\nI am truly lover for geek and pop culture, no shame on\
  \ this. I cannot believe you never pictured yourself singing with Britney Spears\
  \ in the Crossroads movie. I can easily be Alicia Silverstone in Clueless and I\
  \ still in love with her outfits. On Wednesdays I relive Mean Girls and Aaron Samuels.\
  \ \n\nSo in memory of our teenage selves, me and two girl friends planned a road\
  \ trip from New York to Miami. After almost one year of planning, two jobs and savings\
  \ we made it. Ferris Bueller took two weeks off. Everything was perfect on paper,\
  \ of course. \n\nWe did the research on the bus company, got some snacks and went\
  \ to the bus station after a few days in New York. Everything was all right, until\
  \ nothing more was all right. Our bus was broken, we had to wait for other one,\
  \ so we left the bus station after 3 hours of waiting.\n\nOur bus trip just turned\
  \ into 5 buses changes and uncountable bus stops. And we were not alone in this\
  \ modern Jedi saga. We were with our bus family, people who were going to Florida\
  \ like us. Mothers, children, babies, immigrants and tourists.\n\nWe proudly named\
  \ ourselves Greyhound Family \n\nElizabeth was pregnant, she found out the baby\
  \ gender days before the bus trip, a boy. She already had a baby girl, such easy\
  \ going and smiley baby. Her ex-stepfather is Mexican, so she learned Spanish with\
  \ him and her husband is from Puerto Rico. And the baby boy will be named as him,\
  \ because he always wanted a boy, he has to girls. The first girl is from a previous\
  \ relationship. She told me so. \n\n In the other bus, I sited near to the Philippine\
  \ girl, who lived in Canada, she was just showing U.S to her Philippine uncles and\
  \ arguing with her boyfriend on social media every other hour. She was a big Caribbean\
  \ fan and Canada Dry. We talked a lot about ocean and complicate relationships.\
  \ She loved the idea of my road trip and totally agreed with my Crossroads feeling.\n\
  \nThere was an old Mexican couple in the bus too. They were with their grandson\
  \ and could not speak English very well and apparently not even Spanish. They almost\
  \ got on the wrong bus twice, so the Greyhound Family had to watch over then just\
  \ to make sure they arrived in Florida. And the Greek guy who came to U.S to work\
  \ with bridges, had three kids back home and was fascinated with everything that\
  \ I told him about Brazil and teach him how to say \u2018thank you\u2019 in Portuguese.\
  \ \n\nWe had a 4 hours bus stop in North Carolina, we used this time to have a wipe\
  \ bath, we found a coffee shop and recorded videos making fun of the horrible/funny\
  \ situation. The staff from the bus company tried to separate the Greyhound Family,\
  \ they tried to put us in different buses and add more 2 hours on our waiting. Of\
  \ course it did not end up well for the staff. You do not mess with the exhausted\
  \ Greyhound Family. We finally arrived in Orlando and called my cousin to rescue\
  \ us, because according to the bus company we had to wait incredible 11 hours to\
  \ catch a bus to Tampa. So my cousin came as a light in the end of the hole. \n\n\
  Now, me and my friends, we still make jokes about this crazy bus trip and wonder\
  \ how everybody in The Greyhound Family are doing by now. We could not picture our\
  \ road trip without this bus adventure, without the Greyhound Family. So stressful\
  \ and so funny. The ironic thing it is I am going to Florida again on June. My flight\
  \ goes to Orlando, but I need to go to Tampa. Guess how I am going to get there\u2026\
  Yes, of course, by bus. Why not?"
