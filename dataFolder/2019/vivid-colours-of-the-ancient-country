Text: "Earlier, before this journey, I always travelled only with my family. The trip\
  \ to Armenia was my first solo voyage. It is a kind of journey when you don't know\
  \ what is in store for you. Absolutely another culture and another people. I could\
  \ only imagine what I will see in a foreign country.\nMy arrival was coincident\
  \ with the ancient Armenian holiday Vardavar, that was held in the city at that\
  \ time. From the very first seconds Armenia had gripped me with its unusual culture\
  \ and vivid colours. Thousands of happy people and a lot of water. All the inhabitants\
  \ leave their houses, taking water in absolutely any container. They shower each\
  \ other and have fun, celebrating the middle of the summer. This holiday is dedicated\
  \ to the cult of water and purity. There is a legend that if you get drenched to\
  \ the skin at this day, then all your sins, committed during the year, will be washed\
  \ away with water. \nBut for the tourist such an unexpected holiday can turn into\
  \ a huge problem. I had no idea about the Vardavar before I decided to visit the\
  \ city. But when I arrived to the very heart of the city, on the Square of Republic,\
  \ I finally understood the full extent of my personal catastrophy. I needed to wait\
  \ somewhere for a couple of hours before leaving to the hotel. And these hours I\
  \ will remember for all my life. During the Vardavar, almost no public institution\
  \ in the city works, all cafes are closed. And you become a living target for all\
  \ fun lovers. It goes without saying that you become a \u201Choney pie\u201D especially\
  \ as a tourist, and as a girl. And within ten minutes I was drenched to the skin.\
  \ And I prayed only that my laptop, which was hidden in a traveling bag, was still\
  \ alive after this amount of water. No matter how strictly you ask them to stop,\
  \ they nevertheless will wet you with water. You get hysterical because you are\
  \ in a completely unfamiliar place, with strangers, and they just laugh in your\
  \ face and pour another bucket of water on your head.\nCulture is often aggressive.\
  \ I try not to consider this story from the point of ethnocentrism, trying to find\
  \ an explanation for the actions of citizens. But I come back again to the fact\
  \ that often seemingly fun holidays turn into an aggressive act. And it is especially\
  \ difficult to appear at such event when this aggression is aimed personally at\
  \ you. \nLater my friends told me that locals often stay at home on that day in\
  \ order to avoid such public event. Not everyone likes such an eccentric holiday.\
  \ Such douche already carries a lot of troubles. People do not stop even when you\
  \ walk with a phone in your hand. On the contrary, they will punish you for such\
  \ carelessness and will double it, trying to water your gadget. \n- Warm young blood,\
  \ so it goes - noticed my friend David. - Our nation has a special energy and a\
  \ special sense of humor. And during the Vardavar it is only multiplied.\nI was\
  \ surprised because in my country only the children and youth take part in such\
  \ events. But, that day I saw the representatives of all age groups on the streets.\n\
  - Here, in Armenia, there is the cult of children,- laughed Mary. - We love children\
  \ so much that we want to look like them this day. \nBut despite all the noise and\
  \ joyfulness of the holiday that I saw in a city, Armenia had been left as a country\
  \ of wisdom and peace for me. As I travelled outside the capital Yerevan, and came\
  \ to Sevan lake, I felt the entire history of this ancient country. The old Church,\
  \ which we visited before the sunset, kept all secrets of this wise nation. We met\
  \ the sunset on the terrace of David\u2019s house, located near the lake.\nI was\
  \ impressed that Armenia is a country of contrasts. So noisy outside and so deep\
  \ inside. Like its inhabitants, who despite all the hardships, continued to enjoy\
  \ every moment."
