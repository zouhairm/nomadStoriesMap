Text: "2 p.m. in the afternoon, standing in front of the city hall in Lyon, France.\
  \ I was waiting for someone. Someone who just sent me messages through Couchsurfing\
  \ to explore the city together. His profile seems that he has been traveled a lot,\
  \ and I was looking for travel inspirations during the trip, perfect. 10 minutes\
  \ passed, there\u2019s no one wearing a hat and with a skateboard, as he described\
  \ to me, wondering at the square where is in front of the city hall, right next\
  \ to Museum of Fine Arts. A message received \u201CI don\u2019t see you, I am right\
  \ by the metro station.\u201D, I did not see any metro station, then I realized\
  \ I was at the back of the city hall\u2026\nLyon, the third large city in France,\
  \ a city full of charms, arts, and history. Where the author of Little Prince was\
  \ born and where the cinema has been invented. It was his second time in Lyon, visiting\
  \ an old friend. Have you ever felt connected when you met a complete stranger?\
  \ I have, for the first time. Despite the language barriers, we talked like we\u2019\
  ve been known each other for years. We did not pass through the tiring part of introducing\
  \ ourselves, it started by \u201Cwhere do you want to go? I\u2019ll follow, it doesn\u2019\
  t matter if we\u2019re lost.\u201D I told him that I always dreamt of trying skateboard\
  \ one day, and the next second I realized that I was on his skateboard at the Place\
  \ Bellecour, next to a statue of Louis XIV. The weather was nice and sunny, we sat\
  \ on a bench and talking my childhood \u201Cthree minutes\u2019 passion for learning\
  \ new interests\u201D, and we laughed.\nThe\_Basilica of Notre-Dame de Fourvi\xE8\
  re is located on the west hill of Lyon, you can point out easily in the city center.\
  \ This was our second destination, although he has already been there a day before,\
  \ he said it\u2019s worth it to be there for the second time. The basilica was built\
  \ in 19 century in a dominant position overlooking the city. There are different\
  \ versions of the Virgin Mary which are dedicated by believers from various countries\
  \ in the crypt of the basilica. An old lady was standing in front of the Polish\
  \ version of Virgin Mary, she\u2019s changing the flowers in the vases, and hesitating\
  \ where\u2019s the best spot putting the vases. I got curious, so I looked at her\
  \ quietly. He approached the lady and told her maybe the yellow one in the middle\
  \ was more visible and coordinate. The lady was so glad and started talking to us.\
  \ She\u2019s from Poland, but she has lived in France for almost the whole of her\
  \ life, she used to nurse a lady for 21 years, now she climbs up the hill and comes\
  \ here twice a week, always with fresh flowers. Both of her son and daughter were\
  \ working in other cities, she spoke with pride and a slice of loneliness. Afterward,\
  \ he told me that he saw my eyes full of curiosity that\u2019s the reason why he\
  \ talked to the old lady in the first place. I\u2019m glad we did, she seemed happy\
  \ to talk to someone. \nSometimes we are too afraid of being rejected by people,\
  \ so we do nothing, we do not act, and that\u2019s the timing we lose an opportunity\
  \ to connect with others. The most fascinating part of traveling is that we always\
  \ meet someone who inspires us somehow do something differently, something that\
  \ we would never do in the past. We do not want to be a person without feeling connected\
  \ with others in this madness world, the more as time goes by, we have to try harder\
  \ to get back our wildness and courage to act differently."
