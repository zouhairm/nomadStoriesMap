Text: "As a Brazilian girl graduated in journalism, with no english, no job opportunities\
  \ and bored for living an unemployed life, jump into a new country would be the\
  \ perfect opportunity to be able to learn a new language and to know myself better.\n\
  As a rule for my life, I use to think and believe that if we want, we can make it\
  \ real, doesn't matter the dificulties; and then, I did.\nSuitcases done, farewell\
  \ parties lived, it was time to go.\nI got Dublin planing to stay 8 months and here\
  \ I've been for two years.\nI got the Guinness Country to know myself better, to\
  \ feel myself alive, to feel the taste of challeging day by day, to feel how is\
  \ living in a safe country, to understand how the freedom to be who you are is important.\
  \ \nLanding in Ireland I could feel, for the first time in life, the feeling to\
  \ be alone in a space that is not yours, was terrifying but at the same time I found\
  \ myself relived to get done whole journey without problems; I mean, I almost lost\
  \ the connection from London to Dublin, but for a girl who couldn\u2019t speak any\
  \ english.. this is the smallest problem we could expect.  \nI got the transfer\
  \ safe. In the way for the Hostel I could start understanding where I was. Europe!\
  \ It was January, hard winter, dry trees, smoke going out from my mouth in each\
  \ word, big roads, left hand, people wearing coats that I\u2019ve just seen when\
  \ watching movies. I found myself dreaming, but the reality was just starting.\n\
  My first impression about the Irish people? How could them be so polite! The transfer\
  \ dropped me few metres before the Hostel, and to help me with my 3 heavy suitcases?\
  \ An old man giving me his hand. He read the address I should get and helped me\
  \ until there, his words I cant remember, first of all because I couldn\u2019t understand,\
  \ but I bet he told me good and positive words which made my way until now so lucky.\n\
  Luck, Ireland is the country of the shamrock, and how positive and happy is here.\
  \ After fifteen days at the hostel and a huge search for the first place to live,\
  \ the luck was indeed with me, first shared house founded. New experiences, new\
  \ perspectives, new people, new costumes, new vision about how to live, new feeling\
  \ about what is home.\LAfter 3 months, the first job, as assistant chef. How? Don\u2019\
  t make me difficult questions. Rs. I mean, I didn\u2019t have any experience in\
  \ a kitchen, but thats how it is, or you get ready and go for it, or the first step\
  \ will never be done. After this job, after the first impact of been working in\
  \ something you never worked in your life.. I was ready to start the journey.\n\
  Living in Dublin for two years, I could have lived the craziest job you can imagine.\
  \ What about to hold signs from a supermarket while you have 8 balloons in each\
  \ arm? What about to be waitress when you never hold a tray before? What about to\
  \ be bartender when you never made a drink a part from the Brazilian Caipirinha?\n\
  Dublin has bringing me the most important, unbelievable and rich experiences I could\
  \ ever live. I\u2019ve learned about family, about myself, about friendship, about\
  \ love. I\u2019ve learned how to be strong when everything seems to fail. I\u2019\
  ve learned how to be proud of any job you have done and how to respect all of the\
  \ professionals around me, is important to recognise that everybody deserve the\
  \ same value and treatment.\nI came from a country where most of the times the people\
  \ doesn\u2019t see or believe in equality.\nI came from a country where the education\
  \ has failures and the people doesn\u2019t care so much about each other.\nIreland\
  \ showed me beautiful landscapes, friendly people. Brought me unforgettable memories,\
  \ feelings and skills.\nI came from a world and now I\u2019m transformed by the\
  \ one I\u2019ve been living.  I came seen one person through the mirror, I will\
  \ back home without recognise the one who I saw."
