Text: "I never expected to enjoy an outdoor thermal bath in the middle of a snowstorm.\n\
  \nThermal baths, for those not in the know, are collections of indoor and outdoor\
  \ pools built around mineral-rich hot springs. Budapest has been famous for them\
  \ since Roman times. There are several within the city limits, of which the most\
  \ famous are Sz\xE9chenyi and Gellert. Having been to Sz\xE9chenyi before, I decide\
  \ to brave the slush and snow and venture across the Danube to the Gellert Spa and\
  \ Baths.\n\nThe baths at Gellert are beautiful - decorated in art-deco extravagance,\
  \ detailed and picturesque. The tilework all along the walls and ceiling is all\
  \ blues, greens, and whites, creating a lush and welcoming atmosphere - someone\
  \ clearly knew something about calming color psychology. It is curated to build\
  \ relaxation.\n\nHowever.\n\nRelaxed I am not.\n\nI can barely move without throwing\
  \ an elbow. Despite being December, there are people packed in from wall-to-wall\
  \ in the thermal pools, enjoying their time, perhaps, but also taking up all the\
  \ best spots. \n\nI can barely think with the multitude of voices echoing off the\
  \ tiled walls. Tile, it seems, is not particularly conducive to great acoustics.\n\
  \nThen, just as I\u2019m contemplating throwing in my rented towel after a pathetic\
  \ thirty minutes, I spot a sign that says \u201Coutdoors.\u201D Assuming nothing\
  \ can be worse than the mob of people indoors, I venture through the maze of pools\
  \ and changing rooms, to the frigid outdoors, figuring that at least I will get\
  \ a picturesque view before departing. \n\nInstead, I find an unexpected moment\
  \ of magic.\n\nPast the tide pool, which sits abandoned in the winter, and up some\
  \ slippery wooden stairs, I stumble across a thermal bath sitting on a balcony overlooking\
  \ the Gellert complex. Six people sit around the edges, quietly conversing amongst\
  \ themselves and largely hidden behind the massive wall of steam. \n\nI step into\
  \ the water. \n\nIt feels heavenly in comparison to the cool Hungarian air. My toes,\
  \ formerly icicles, tingle as they become functional once again. The discomfort\
  \ of being surrounded by people on all sides fades away as I claim a lovely corner\
  \ of the bath for myself.\n\nThe quiet sounds of the taps spouting out more warm\
  \ water and the soft voices of others meld to build a comforting murmur. The snow\
  \ falls down lightly on my face and the rising domes of Gellert, creating a sense\
  \ of magic that cannot be manufactured. The bite of the air becomes less noticeable,\
  \ and even welcome set against the warmth of the heated pool.\n\nThere is magic\
  \ in the air, unintentionally discovered and unbroken. The bath is welcoming and\
  \ unjudging. I am entirely unconscious of the others and savor this simple pleasure\
  \ that the various inhabitants of Budapest have enjoyed for centuries. \n\nThere\
  \ is a world beyond this bath. I will eventually adjourn back to the cold and slush\
  \ of the streets, stumbling off to find nourishment and meet with friends. I am\
  \ content though to let this world melt away for a brief and serendipitous moment."
