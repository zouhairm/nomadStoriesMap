Text: "So back in October 2018 I received a very eager message in my airbnb inbox\
  \ from a native of Vienna.  Opening with how excited he was to venture solo to Los\
  \ Angeles.  As I read his enthusiasm was practically jumping out of the screen in\
  \ pages and pages of information, explaining why he was so eager to get out the\
  \ mindset of his current lifestyle and dive into the sunny California to experience\
  \ what  he saw in tv shows! \nFor my profession, I am the Resident Director of Music\
  \ at Millennium Dance Complex.  For the last sixteen years to present this has been\
  \ my passion! When I told my airbnb guest what I did for a living the back and forth\
  \ was like a tennis match. Flash forward to his arrival. We were inseparable for\
  \ the entire duration of his stay, so much that we cried when it was time for him\
  \ to leave.  As I held him in my arms I realized he did not want to go back to his\
  \ life in Vienna.  I felt a strong emotion I had never felt before, at 38 years\
  \ old I was in love for the first time.  I thought my Goodness, this is what my\
  \ friends and family have been talking about all these years! Dismissing all feelings\
  \ and thoughts about love prior to this experience made me so available to open\
  \ my heart to the magic and splendor that love has to offer! Then my FaceTime exploded!\
  \ For three months we FaceTimed for at least an hour or two daily. I decided I\u2019\
  m going to Vienna! I  Consulted my parents, and they said you have to go and see\
  \ where this leads! \nI purchased my ticket, and was on my way! \nI can\u2019t tell\
  \ you how magical the entire Vienna experience has been, I\u2019m still on cloud\
  \ nine, words can not express my gratitude and appreciation for the music, the city,\
  \ the breathtaking architecture and of course love at its finest.  My next one man\
  \ show will certainly be about my experience and I eagerly await my next assignment!\
  \ Choose me for your scholarship and I will guarantee a story that readers will\
  \ not want to stop reading! \n\nAll my love always \n\nJustin Kopplin"
