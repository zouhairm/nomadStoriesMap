Text: 'When you think of Italy, you probably think of Rome, dont you? Venice. Florence.
  or Milan maybe? No one thinks of Turin. Turin is underrated. Lots of people think
  it''s just an ordinary industrial city. I did, too. And the city proved me wrong.
  There are tons of reasons why you should book your next Italian trip to Turin. For
  once, it was the first capital city of Italy. Yup, you probably didn''t know that.


  Not only the first capital of Italy, it''s also the royal capital

  Turin is home to Vittorio Emanuele II of Savoy, the first king of  the Kingdom of
  Italy. Although many other cities of Italy hosted noble families that reigned in
  the level of city-states, only Turin could claim itself as the first capital of
  the unified Italy. Turin is full of beautiful palaces in its grand squares. As babygirl
  said, it''s full of the homes of Prince Eric (she''s currently into Little Mermaid).
  The squares look amazing, the main square, Piazza Castello, has unusual water fountains
  coming out the floor surface which babygirl enjoyed so much. It also has direct
  view to the Royal Palace. If Piazzas and Palazzos are not enough for you, Turin
  also hosts the infamous Mole Antonelliana, also known as the Eiffel tower of Italy,
  now hosting the National Museum of Cinema, the tallest museum in the world. We wanted
  to take the panoramic elevator ride to its top, but we didn''t make due to our limited
  time in Turin, so this tower is our first reason to come back to Turin soon.'
