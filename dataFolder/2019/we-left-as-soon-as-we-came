Text: "In the middle of a jungle, on a small island of Thailand, my friend and I battle\
  \ a weak wifi connection and swarms of insects to find a place to sleep for the\
  \ next night. However, that\u2019s not where the challenge starts. We would have\
  \ been fine where we were, but life is never so simple, and neither were the three\
  \ elderly people we were travelling with.     \n \nThe first time I travelled without\
  \ my family was also my first time planning accommodations and transportation for\
  \ four more people besides myself. Those were; my friend Micah, an elderly couple\
  \ (Paul and Diana), and their friend Janice. Paul and Diana are family friends of\
  \ Micah\u2019s and mine, so when they asked if we\u2019d like to travel with them\
  \ to Thailand we both jumped at the opportunity... not knowing the predicaments\
  \ that would befall us.  \n\nIt began when Diane broke her arm a week into the trip,\
  \ spending the rest of the month in a neon green cast and sling.\nAfter that hospital\
  \ trip, I began preparing for our voyage from Phuket to the neighbouring island\
  \ of Koh Lanta. It was a reasonable ferry ride away, but I didn\u2019t know where\
  \ to go once we got there. After contacting the owner, I found out two things; the\
  \ address and that due to their computer error, Paul, Diane and Janice\u2019s reservation\
  \ didn\u2019t exist. I could feel dread and panic grow in my stomach. I wasn\u2019\
  t sure what to do. But then I remembered the one superpower a white woman like me\
  \ could harness at a time like this\u2026 talking to the manager.  \n \nI called\
  \ the booking site itself and channelling my best damsel-in-distress voice, proceeded\
  \ to tell them that I was a young woman travelling alone with my ageing (and now\
  \ injured) \u201Cgrandparents\u201D and since the owner refused to help us concerning\
  \ their reservation mix-up, we didn\u2019t have a place to stay. They told me they\u2019\
  d contact me soon regarding what they could do.\n\nFeeling a little hopeful but\
  \ still apprehensive, I decided not to tell anyone besides Micah. There was nowhere\
  \ to go but forward, in a few hours, we\u2019d all be literally sailing straight\
  \ into the unknown.\nThe ferry ride was beautiful and comfortable, but it didn\u2019\
  t stop me from wanting to throw myself straight into the boat's propellers. Halfway\
  \ through the journey, I got my deliverance. A message saying that it was all resolved,\
  \ everyone will have a place to sleep tonight. Able to enjoy living again, I looked\
  \ on to the approaching crown of land with Micah. \u201CWhatever happens after this,\
  \ I\u2019ll be ready,\u201D I naively thought to myself.    \n \nWe expected the\
  \ bungalows to be small and rustic, tucked away from the bustling main streets but\
  \ still within walking distance of the beach.\nAfter realizing our final destination\
  \ was a few loosely congregated cabins in the middle of what seemed to be a jungle,\
  \ I could feel the disapproving eyes of the group on my back. As the sun dipped\
  \ out of sight below the horizon, so did our optimism. Paul looked at me and said,\
  \ \u201CWhen you said this place was off the beaten path, I didn\u2019t know you\
  \ actually meant off the edge of the world.\u201D Diane shot him a look, but I knew\
  \ we were all thinking the same thing. \nIt was easy to see that the property wasn't\
  \ well maintained: the gravel paths outside were integrating with the jungle\u2019\
  s preexisting carpet, humidity and rain ate away the strength of the stairs and\
  \ walls of the cabins, and the bug net that hung above the bed had seen better days.\
  \ With no rental car or scooter, the only way to reach the town was a two-hour hike\
  \ through the wilderness. With three people pushing 70, staying just wasn\u2019\
  t an option. So with the same vigour and panic, I used to come here, I used to get\
  \ out. Micah and I stayed up late looking for anywhere that'll have us, fighting\
  \ off bugs and weak wifi signals in a place far from home, Micah looked at me and\
  \ said: \u201CAt least we\u2019ll laugh at this in the future.\u201D She was right."
