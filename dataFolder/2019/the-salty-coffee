Text: "Wuzhen is raining, like it always does. Tiny raindrops quietly splash on the\
  \ windscreen, crawl to hug each other and drift down together, leaving a trail behind\
  \ them. With the gloomy melody coming out from the music player, my tears unconsciously\
  \ shed. \u201CHi sir, would you mind switching to a happier one?\u201D I said to\
  \ the taxi driver, and then lay back, with my eyes closed, sinking into deep thoughts.\n\
  \nTwo months ago, I came to this town, for a dream\u2019s sake. \n\nHaving been\
  \ a reader of Muxin for over four years, I often dreamt about visiting the Muxin\
  \ Art Museum, where his paintings and manuscripts exhibited. What would it be like\
  \ to actually be in somewhere you\u2019ve always admired? After my two-months journey,\
  \ I am still wondering.\n\nDiffered from my previous trips, I became part of the\
  \ destination for tourists to visit\u2014as a volunteer in the museum, my job was\
  \ to stand in the gallery, and answer audience\u2019s questions, always with a smile\
  \ of course. Whenever there was just me alone, I considered it a blessing, for I\
  \ could unleash my attention, letting inspiration randomly bumped into my head:\
  \ That grey color could be used in the decoration of my future house\u2026The manuscript\
  \ in front of me is so quiet. Is that the sound of words?\n\nSometimes it could\
  \ be interesting to observe audience\u2019s behavior. For most of the people, they\
  \ replaced their eyes with cameras. All they wanted was to take a picture with the\
  \ exhibit, and post it on social media. But occasionally, one or two would show\
  \ up and made my day. Some sobbed watching videos about Muxin like I what I did\
  \ at first. \u201CAh, one more Muxin\u2019s reader\u201D I said to myself; some\
  \ came and shared their opinions with me, regarding the understanding of Muxin\u2019\
  s works, the design of the museum, etc. In that moment, they did not feel like strangers\
  \ at all. \n\nThe majority would consider working in an art museum poetic, but in\
  \ fact, monotony was the main tune\u2014after the excitement of the first three\
  \ days, I had to reach out myself a little further day by day, not to live my life\
  \ as copy and paste. Reading was a good way for that, especially Muxin\u2019s books.\
  \ One day, I was just start to read one of his poems, his voice of reading that\
  \ poem coming out from the video room behind me. All of a sudden, I thought he were\
  \ still alive, using his vigorous wisdom-like voice to edify me. \n\nTwo months\
  \ slipped, as I imagined. For the last fifteen days, I\u2019ve been preparing for\
  \ the parting. I tried to remember every brick I walked on, the unknown birds\u2019\
  \ songs outside and the shadow that the sunlight cast from dawn to dust. Now and\
  \ then, some of my colleagues said to me: \u201CI will miss you.\u201D I thought\
  \ I was well-prepared and indeed in the last day, I stayed composed, visiting all\
  \ the galleries one last time as a tourist. Then I went to bid farewell. \n\n\u201C\
  Wait, let me make you a coffee.\u201D The girl working in the coffee shop said.\
  \ I sat down. She handed me a cup of latte with a leaf-like pattern. Never was a\
  \ coffee felt that smooth and\u2026salty? Ha, when did my tears flood out? Shouldn\u2019\
  t I be happy getting a tasty coffee for free? That was so embarrassed. I gulped\
  \ down the coffee and rushed out of the museum. And never looked back. \n\n\u201C\
  Hey, the airport is arrived.\u201D The driver\u2019s voice wakes me up. Time to\
  \ leave now, away from this peaceful town, where my favorite writer spent his childhood\
  \ and his last few years. Growing up in metropolis, never have my heart tightly\
  \ bond with a place. If I were a plant, here is the very place for me to grow my\
  \ root, but it\u2019s also a restriction which prevents me from exploring more possibilities.\
  \ My reason forces me to leave. \n\n\u201CThanks.\u201D I get off the car. The taste\
  \ of the salty coffee appears again in my mouth. Only no coffee."
