Text: "Bright sunshine at what was supposed to be 11.30pm (GMT). That\u2019s what\
  \ initially greeted me as I stepped off the plane at San Francisco International.\
  \ My London-tuned body clock was telling me one thing, but the position of the sun\
  \ was stating another fact entirely. I had, quite literally, travelled through time.\
  \ \n\nAs I emerged from the airport, knowing how Marty McFly must have felt when\
  \ he stepped out of the Doc\u2019s time machine into 1955, I was struck by the vastness\
  \ of everything. Compared to Ye Olde England, this place was unlike anything I had\
  \ seen before; I had never set foot outside of Europe and had only witnessed the\
  \ US in photos or on TV and in films. This was my first long-distance trip and I\
  \ couldn\u2019t quite believe I had landed on American soil. \n\nThe houses \u2013\
  \ a sloping landscape of bright pastel colours and garnished with hanging floral\
  \ wreaths \u2013 were a breath of fresh air for someone so acquainted with London\u2019\
  s harsh grey concrete jungle. By far the most unusual thing I experienced on that\
  \ first afternoon was taking a trip to the local Mexican diner when my body was\
  \ screaming at me to be in bed, for heaven\u2019s sake. \n\nAs we adjusted into\
  \ Californian life over those first few days (hauling ourselves up the huge hills\
  \ at every turn) cultural differences proved a regular occurrence. Whilst hiding\
  \ the fact that I could not grasp the difference between a cent and a quarter, I\
  \ attempted to ask for \u201Cwaaarrrrteeeuuurrrr\u201D in local cafes or grocery\
  \ stores and gradually began to accept that this was a country where you needed\
  \ a key to use public toilets, where water was sometimes packaged in plastic cartons\
  \ and where, to my horror, they did not always sell English breakfast tea. Our accents\
  \ were also met with curiosity \u2013 to local ears they were anything from Canadian\
  \ to Australian. \n\nExperiencing the little things that made up the heart of San\
  \ Francisco were definitely the highlight of my trip \u2013 bumpy tram rides and\
  \ learning the local bus route, for instance. Buses invited all kinds of colourful\
  \ characters on board, sometimes demanding you give up your seat for them. California\
  \ certainly has a more relaxed, slower pace than that of its east coast counterparts,\
  \ but once you arrive in the main city it still has an infectious buzz that\u2019\
  s hard not to get swept up by.\n\nSo while I was exploring the city by day, 9 hours\
  \ ahead in London my family and friends were sleeping by night, and when I was just\
  \ waking up they were finishing work for the day. This space-time continuum would\
  \ continue over the next 10 days. \n\nOne day I took a solo bus trip to visit a\
  \ nearby art gallery. Since I had not joined the modern phone world back in 2016,\
  \ all I had as my guide were a few handwritten directions copied from a Google maps\
  \ search. To my dismay, the bus initially neglected to display each stop, so for\
  \ a time I was literally an alien travelling through a foreign land. I plucked up\
  \ enough courage to ask the bus driver to turn the signs back on, or at least tell\
  \ me where I needed to get off for the gallery. She kindly obliged and guided me\
  \ in the right direction. \n\nUpon reaching the gallery I was able to gaze at the\
  \ Golden Gate Bridge in all its glory, simultaneously exchanging polite comments\
  \ with passers-by. Whilst walking towards the main entrance, a woman and her daughter\
  \ had just visited the same exhibition I was planning to see and since they no longer\
  \ needed their tickets, they gave one to me, no questions asked. Another small act\
  \ of American courtesy."
