Text: "I was due to meet my friend in arrivals at 1 pm. We were each flying in on\
  \ different flights; hers coming from the Netherlands, and mine from France. I had\
  \ three long hours of waiting ahead of me. I had planned to wander around the airport\
  \ and do some window-shopping, but upon arriving I realised that this was not going\
  \ to be possible. As I entered the arrivals terminal at Casablanca airport I clocked\
  \ about two cafes, and one small kiosk selling newspapers and magazines. There were\
  \ people bustling everywhere, and the majority were bustling in large, familial\
  \ groups. I quickly ducked to the side of the crowds to get out of the way and walked\
  \ straight into a cloud of smoke. In fact at every subsequent turn I seemed to come\
  \ face to face with a white acrid cloud.  I sought refuge in one of the cafes and\
  \ found a small sign in one corner which from the picture, seemed to indicate a\
  \ no-smoking area. I sat down and relaxed a little. \nI started looking for a plug\
  \ socket to charge my mobile and found one immediately - conveniently located right\
  \ next to my table. Inconveniently, it was literally hanging out of the wall with\
  \ wires poking out. I decided my phone was too important to test it and banished\
  \ the thought of charging it before my friend arrived. I was starting to consider\
  \ a tasty, foreign snack when a man came and sat down a few feet away. He looked\
  \ at the sign and immediately lit up a cigarette. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh\
  \ to myself. Despite the omnipresent smoke, the bustle and the very raw state of\
  \ infrastructure, I started to get that buzzing excitement of being somewhere completely\
  \ different to where I\u2019m used to. The smells, sounds and sights were completely\
  \ new! I congratulated myself on the idea of coming to Morocco as I bought a coffee\
  \ and spent the next 2 hours people-watching. \nWhen my friend arrived I was impatient\
  \ to get out and see more. Stepping outside there was that immediate smell of hot\
  \ ground, which is so foreign to English people, and immediately screams HOLIDAY!\
  \ We found a taxi, let him overcharge us, and half an hour later we were in the\
  \ middle of Casablanca. We dumped our bags, powered up with a tooth-achingly, sugary\
  \ mint tea and headed to the market to start exploring. \nI can only describe this\
  \ market as magical. Not a sparkly, fancy magical, but a shocking, can\u2019t-believe-what-I-just-saw\
  \ magical. Firstly you have to dodge the clumps of rubbish on the street to navigate\
  \ your way to an entrance. Then you enter the maze, from which not even bread crumbs\
  \ can save you, as the roaming chickens will gobble them up. You will pass stalls\
  \ selling absolutely anything that anyone, anywhere in the world has ever wanted.\
  \ Kaftans, tunics, shoes, tagines, pots, bags, scarves, bread, djellabas, pastries,\
  \ electronics, meat (raw, cooked, and still alive), chairs, tables... And there\
  \ are people there buying it all, haggling, inspecting the goods or just catching\
  \ up with friends and family whilst rogue pigs wander down the alley. Forget taking\
  \ pictures - there are too many things to focus on, and if your eyes aren\u2019\
  t on the path, you\u2019re likely to step in something you\u2019d rather not. But\
  \ don\u2019t worry, it is an assault on the senses that one does not forget easily.\n\
  Luckily for me, I had forgotten headphones for my iPod, so I excitedly jumped into\
  \ a bit of haggling at the electronics stall. I picked up a pair of EarPods and\
  \ eagerly asked how much. \u201810 Dirham\u2019 he answered. I quickly calculated\
  \ that as about 50p. I dejectedly handed over the money and walked away. You can\u2019\
  t really argue with that price. I half expected that they wouldn\u2019t work, but\
  \ to my delight they did! And what\u2019s more, they are still working now, 3 years\
  \ later.\nAfter finding ourselves outside the market, it took another 10 minutes\
  \ to work out where we\u2019d exited and locate a main road. We needed a drink!\
  \ Being a predominantly Muslim country, alcohol is not easy to find, but there is\
  \ this little bar called Rick\u2019s..."
