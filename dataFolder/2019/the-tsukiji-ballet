Text: "\u201CThey are going to tear it down. Put up apartments\u201D says Kazuo. \
  \ He squints so his eyes can adjust to the light as he absorbs the familiar scene\
  \ around him. \n\nI met Kazuo the night before through a friend at a restaurant\
  \ in the upscale Ayoyama neighbourhood. Over plates of creamy maguro sashimi, salty\
  \ sweet firefly squid, milky white cubes of tofu topped with fresh grated ginger\
  \ and chives and tea green ceramic tumblers filled with cold filtered sake we find\
  \ out Kazuo has a resume more interesting than most. His small frame and big smile\
  \ hide it well, but ten years ago he was a professional boxer with an impressive\
  \ 13-2-1 record. After hanging up his gloves, he worked at Tsukiji and he has offered\
  \ to take me on an insider\u2019s tour of the market. \n\nIt\u2019s already after\
  \ 6 AM when I meet Kazuo. There\u2019s a delicate truce being negotiated between\
  \ my stomach and the sake from the night before. We are too late for the legendary\
  \ tuna auction and we proceed directly into the middle market although this area\
  \ is technically off-limits to visitors until 9 AM. But it\u2019s ok, I am with\
  \ Kazuo. He stops and chats with fishmongers and fishermen, women driving ta-rays\
  \ and stocky guys wearing white bandanas cutting fish. Bowing and smiling as we\
  \ navigate the maze that is the market. I wonder how many recognize him as Kazuo\
  \ the fishmonger or Kazuo the boxer. The air is cool and there is no overwhelming\
  \ fishy stench, only the briny smell of the sea. Light glitters off the wet slippery\
  \ cobbled floor. In every direction, there are rows of white foam containers and\
  \ blue plastic crates holding every fish, crustacean, mollusks, cephalopod or echinoid\
  \ that ever walked, crawled, swan or simply sat in the world\u2019s lakes, seas,\
  \ and vast oceans.\n\nWe walk confidently through the market stopping at different\
  \ vendors for Kazuo to talk to old acquaintances or to show some exotic catch. Tsukiji\
  \ is a real working wet market. There is nary room to stand and it seems anywhere\
  \ you stop, if even for a moment to take a photo, there is a ta-ray or person carry\
  \ a crate of seafood with an annoyed scowl on their face shouting to get out of\
  \ the way. Not that the market is loud given the apparent chaos all around. It\u2019\
  s actually remarkably quiet for the beehive of activity taking place everywhere-gigantic\
  \ tuna being surgically dissected with 4\u2019 long samurai sword-like blades; hairy\
  \ orange king crab the size of your head being weighed out, their longs spiny legs\
  \ dangling off the scale, and enormous shiny snapper being lobotomized with thin\
  \ wire rods (iki jime) at assembly line speed. Kazuo explains this is to keep the\
  \ fish fresher longer and makes for better sashimi. Everyone just seems to know\
  \ exactly what they are supposed to be doing, how they are supposed to do it and\
  \ precisely when it\u2019s to be done. I\u2019m yet to see a computer, laptop or\
  \ an iPad at any of the stalls. There are no ERP systems or purchase orders or bar\
  \ codes. The whole machine seems to operate on a system based around red and blue\
  \ markers and notes written on the Styrofoam containers or directly onto the bellies\
  \ of the frozen fish. In the turmoil of activity I step back and for a moment I\
  \ see a well-choreographed ballet of fishmongers, sellers, men pulling carts and\
  \ women laboring over white foam containers, being played out to the hum of ta-rays\
  \ zipping by, all under the cool glow of fluorescent lights. Even the occasional\
  \ reluctant dance with the ill-footed tourist appears well rehearsed.\n\nI leave\
  \ the market knowing that it is the last time I will be here. With plans moving\
  \ full ahead to relocate to nearby Toyosu, the market\u2019s days are numbered.\
  \ The new facility promises to be bigger, cleaner and a high tech example of logistical\
  \ excellence and refrigeration efficiency. Many critics say however the soul of\
  \ the market will be lost forever. I am thankful to my new friend and that I was\
  \ there before the final curtain fell on the ethereal Tsukiji Market ballet."
