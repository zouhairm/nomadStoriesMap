Text: "It was my first time really leaving the country, since Canada was just a mere\
  \ 25 minutes by car I never really considered it a unique experience. But escaping\
  \ the mid-february bitter Buffalo cold and landing in weather exactly 100 degrees\
  \ fahrenheit hotter, clothes sticking to me like glue, the customs agent demanding\
  \ $10 for entry and asking why on earth I would travel to Bajo-Lempa and my fear\
  \ of if the security button would turn red or green. Green meant it was safe to\
  \ go through, but red would call for a complete search of my belongings and most\
  \ likely confiscation of some of the supplies I had packed for the island. Verde.\
  \ I continued outside where the group of thirty high schoolers and a handful of\
  \ adults waiting for la guagua, greeted with bean and cheese pupusas and the smell\
  \ of petroleum and plastic burning. Luckily I remembered to fill my water bottle\
  \ during the layover in Atlanta, and although a bit warm, it was refreshing to gulp\
  \ down fresh water out of my blue nalgene. I would later lose this bottle. \n\n\
  Luggage was put onto the bus first and we all filled in the same way we would for\
  \ an elementary school field trip. The only difference that this one was characterized\
  \ by uncertainty and relying heavily on faith and one another. After two hours of\
  \ singing, pictures of friends sleeping and sweat pooled on the pleather bus seats,\
  \ we got off and made an assembly line to pass luggage from the bus to the tiny\
  \ boat at the shore. I wondered if this was how the makers of the Model T felt,\
  \ each playing a small seemingly insignificant part as the means to an end.  \n\n\
  DEET burned my nose, I could taste it in the back of my throat, stinging like alcohol\
  \ on an opened wound. I kept passing bags along until the bus was empty and the\
  \ boat was full. It was just before taking of my shoes to walk into the river and\
  \ get onto the oversized canoe that I noticed armed military police bearing machine\
  \ guns. We were told that they were for our protection, but from who? From the oppressed\
  \ individuals in one of the poorest areas of El Salvador? \n\nDirected to sit on\
  \ the edge of the boat to balance the weight of each person on our near hour long\
  \ voyage to Monte Cristo, 15 persons on each unstable ship, we were off. One of\
  \ the officers sat next to me and I tried to speak to him a bit with the Spanish\
  \ I knew but he was uninterested and my spanish was elementary compared to a native\
  \ speaker. So we sat in silence on the boat, longing to get to the village we were\
  \ meant to live in community in, meet the locals and begin to experience and grow.\
  \ Dragging suitcases in the dead of night through sand and stone toward an empty\
  \ brick building with a sign that read \u201CCentro de Comunidad\u201D, I felt a\
  \ solace in being secluded. No phone, no internet access, no running water, no mirror,\
  \ no control of time for 10 days. We each set our supplies on the left side of the\
  \ community center, were handed a mattress and a bug nets and made our way to our\
  \ respective sleeping accommodations. Rachel and I walked toward the school where\
  \ the women would sleep, while the men would have the other half of the community\
  \ center. I slept well that night. \n\nAs soon as the sun rose, we were up for breakfast\
  \ made by women in the community and I helped wash the dishes, learning the favorites\
  \ movies, family life and other interests of the women from Monte Cristo. The rest\
  \ of the day was spent setting up a medical clinic, entertaining the children who\
  \ had off from school and befriending the teens in the community. The trip smelled\
  \ like Bath and Body Works Eucalyptus Stress Relief hand sanitizer,  tasted like\
  \ fav reds jolly ranchers, sounded like kids playing pato ganso and f\xFAtbol, felt\
  \ like waves crashing at my ankles and looked like baby sea turtles making their\
  \ way toward the water. Les extra\xF1o."
