Text: "It was at 2 a.m. I was sound asleep in my cosy bed, dreaming of a beautiful\
  \ beach with mountains on the other side. The Mediterranean Sea. Until that moment,\
  \ I had only read about the sea in my geography textbooks at school, and at that\
  \ moment, I was right there, witnessing the vast expanse of the sea. My heart filled\
  \ with gratitude and peace. \nSuddenly an unpleasant noise consumed the whole place\
  \ up. In utter confusion, with hands over my ears, I started running away from the\
  \ seashore for life. The sound was unbearable. It filled in an undefinable horror\
  \ in my rather peaceful heart, and I woke up with a start. My roommate was vigorously\
  \ shouting at me, trying to wake me up. I woke up from my dream to a loud sound\
  \ of sirens that were blaring across the city of Haifa. Yes, Haifa in Israel where\
  \ I had gone to attend a summer school. An announcement filled in the corridors\
  \ of the dormitory to run towards the bunker area on the third floor. I had no idea\
  \ what a bunker was until that day. In utter bewilderment, confusion, shock and\
  \ panic I followed behind the rest of the crowd to the third floor. We stayed there\
  \ for 15 minutes, and life was back to normal.\n8th July 2014. War was officially\
  \ declared between Israel and Palestine on the day I landed in Haifa. It is a beautiful\
  \ city, with mountains on one side and the Mediterranean Sea on the other. As a\
  \ young, 21-year-old Indian woman, it was my first trip abroad at Haifa University.\
  \ I was too excited, and the journey turned out to be super unpredictable.\nTwo\
  \ nights after my arrival I came to know about the existence of bunkers for the\
  \ first time in my life when apparently, some missiles from the Palestinian side\
  \ had come too close to Haifa. My trip had begun with blaring sirens, but we were\
  \ thoroughly assured of our safety. People from around 40 countries had come to\
  \ the summer school that year.\nI don\u2019t know if it was the most suitable time\
  \ to be in this country, but for me, to experience this place in its most vulnerable\
  \ state was something inexplicable. It\u2019s been five years since then, and I\
  \ still remember the incidents so vividly, as if it was just yesterday when I had\
  \ experienced them.\nI still remember the day when our trip to Jerusalem was almost\
  \ cancelled because of the war. The walled city of Jerusalem is magical. It has\
  \ an amazing old-world charm to it. The yellowish stoned paths, walls, buildings\
  \ transported me back to my history books, and I felt like living in a different\
  \ era. The area was especially disturbed. I saw the streets leading to the beautiful\
  \ blue domed, golden Al-Aksa mosque heavily guarded by the army. \nOur guide took\
  \ us to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and showed us the cave where Jesus Christ\
  \ was buried. That spot gave me chills. I was soon enveloped in the grandeur of\
  \ this massive church. \nThe energy of the Wailing Walls was so intense; I was moved\
  \ to tears. With just a touch of the walls, I felt alive. At that moment, I could\
  \ feel my soul. \nI had heard about the Jerusalem syndrome, and at times I have\
  \ an inexplicable urge to go back to the old walled city which gave birth to the\
  \ three major religions of the world- Christianity, Judaism and Islam. The aura\
  \ of this place is unique. It belongs only to this holy land.\nI was living in a\
  \ paradox then. War, death and destruction were making headlines in the media, while\
  \ what I saw was total beauty in this country with a massive history, culture, and\
  \ people yet torn within due to differences.\nIf war were ever a solution, history\
  \ would have had the happiest of tales.\nRoaming around the Arab, Jewish and Christian\
  \ quarters in Jerusalem, I wondered if only people believed in the power of love\
  \ and the futility of war, the world would have been a better place to live. There\
  \ would be peace, harmony, respect, tolerance and acceptance for everyone."
