Text: "At the last minute I booked a random hotel in the village of Bever. Seemingly\
  \ up those steep and very windy severe grey and still just snow capped mountains\
  \ we were near around Davos and St Moritz, switzerland. Surrounded by omnious dark\
  \ clouds Paul, my partner went to the tourist centre to find out how to get to the\
  \ hotel as we couldnt find the village on our gps. He returned saying we had to\
  \ catch a small village train up another mountain, a man with a long grey beard\
  \ and 4 huskys would meet us there. No not really but the story fitted the scene.\
  \ It was gloomy and about to snow or rain. A mountain blizzard began to close in\
  \ ... cue crisis point music..... \n\nBeing close to the italian border we decided\
  \ pizza was needed to get our courage back, once full with comfort food, beer and\
  \ some courage we set off to the train station. The blizzard began .. well not really\
  \ but coats were suddenly whipped out, umbrellas blew inside out and people rushed\
  \ for the cosy inside of the coffee shop in the train station. A wild wind and a\
  \ wild old wisened women with long grey messy hair straight from a suspense thriller\
  \ started to speak to me in english like a prophetic sage saying i was lucky that\
  \ it is so nice today as usually it is stormy and windy! What! It is stormy and\
  \ windy! Right on cue for more tension of the unknown. We sat cosy in the train\
  \ station with hot chocolate in hand and waited our fate and the little 2 car mountain\
  \ train. \nEventually the train arrived.. well we think. We climbed out of the village\
  \ and up the mountain in our little train... glued to the beauty and lack of train\
  \ station platforms, wondering how we would get off. Just before a dark tunnel we\
  \ arrived and climbed down off the train like little children getting off a toy\
  \ train in a theme park. We then crossed the tracks to find our fairytale glorious\
  \ Spinas, our hotel with the hipster (not old man who had been lost in the mountains\
  \ and looks like a yeti). We arrived to a beautiful swiss old wooden home with good\
  \ good memories etched within the walls, delicious food and wine with a oasis of\
  \ mountain wild nature where walkers sat and planned their day, played cards and\
  \ rested their wearied 21st centuary souls. We had glorious walks where the cows\
  \ ate their summer greens and colourful wild flowers high up in the mountains, were\
  \ entertained by the local brass band and alcorn. And with the comforting swiss\
  \ cows and their bell orchestra always tinkering as background music we began to\
  \ unfurl our stress as we were lull by the music and grew to trust the marking of\
  \ the day with their tinkering as they headed for  milking. The food was swiss and\
  \ perfect ..cheese fondue with perfect pine and cherry scnapps to digest and break\
  \ up the kilograms of cheese we just had eaten. The walks were truely heavenly been\
  \ seemingly so close to the sky. We truely felt blessed and grateful. Sadly it came\
  \ time to leave and we vowed to return again one day, glad we leap into the unknown."
