Text: "Travel to me is all about rejuvenation and learning. It is taking a break and\
  \ exploring how the life and times and gain some perspective. Every place has a\
  \ different story to tell and as a traveler, a researcher, and a teacher, I feel\
  \ it attracts me even more. So this time, when my friends and I were planning a\
  \ trip, Sri Lanka was already decided for we had heard a great deal about the place.\
  \ All that was left now was a good Sri Lanka package and that too was taken care\
  \ by Travel Triangle which my friends had recommended me.\n\nAfter connecting with\
  \ them and raising a request, we chose a customized package that we wanted and were\
  \ now all set for the big holiday to Lanka! Here are a few details of our all trip\
  \ to Sri Lanka \n\nWe were warmly welcomed at the Airport and then proceeded onward\
  \ to Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage to see the elephants. It was a beautiful view\
  \ seeing the elephants especially to see the baby elephants doing really well. We\
  \ later went to see the village life, ate the local village food and rode a bullock\
  \ cart as part of the village life experience. Thereafter we went to the UNESCO\
  \ Heritage Site at Dambulla to explore the famous Golden Rock cave temple. The view\
  \ was spectacular and climbing up the stairs to the top was a task on the day of\
  \ arrival. Later we went to Sigiriya for a night stay at Grand Kalundawa Waterfront\
  \ Resort. The \n\nstay was relaxing and the food was very traditional and it was\
  \ a really good experience. Overall, our first day in Sri Lanka was well spent.\n\
  \nOn the second day we climbed the Pidurangala rock for the majestic view of the\
  \ rock fortress of Sigiriya \u2013 the lion rock. En route we visited the spice\
  \ garden, batik factory, and the sacred Temple of the Tooth Relic which was a beautiful\
  \ and peaceful site. Thereafter we enjoyed the Kandyan Cultural show. Our overnight\
  \ stay was at Hotel Travellers Nest, Kandy.\n\nToday post breakfast, we first visited\
  \ the gem museum which was a pleasant sight to see and learn about how Sri Lanka\
  \ is a harbour of gems. Thereafter proceeded to Bentota where the evening was for\
  \ our pleasure.\n\nThe day was spent in exploring Bentota and different activities\
  \ such as visiting the turtle hatchery, river safari, paramotoring. Overall, it\
  \ was a refreshing experience and we felt really good seeing the turtle conservation\
  \ efforts by the harchers. It was also a wonderful experience to hold them. A day\
  \ spent in nature is truly well spent indeed!\n\n\n\nI had never thought Sri Lanka\
  \ is that beautiful but as it turned out, I returned home mesmerized. The city is\
  \ beautiful, the food is delicious (but that would depend on each person), and the\
  \ beaches are amazingly serene. I really enjoyed seeing the turtles especially the\
  \ baby turtles. They are really beautiful creatures. And another beautiful thing\
  \ to see around Sri Lanka is the Buddhist temple. It is warm and a place for peace\
  \ and serenity. Needless to say, our all girls trip to Sri Lanka was super successful\
  \ and fun!"
