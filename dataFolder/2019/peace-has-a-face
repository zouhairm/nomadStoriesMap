Text: "I went to Jaipur last year in  the month of june for training even i went before\
  \ also but i found something novel this time. I went with two friends of mine though\
  \  they were not excited as i was. I always crave for peace but I was unaware how\
  \ it looks.\nWe have holidays on every Saturday and Sunday from work so these are\
  \ the best days to explore the 'Pink City ' Jaipur. So we have decided that we will\
  \ go on shopping this coming Saturday . But i got headache and vomiting on Friday\
  \ night so we cancelled that plan. My friends got sad and it was disturbing me alot.\
  \ I was resting in my room and suddenly I felt that someone is saying me go to Amer.\
  \ I don't know who was that. Then i convinced my friends and we booked cab and started\
  \ to get ready. Luckily we got ready on time but our cab was half an hour late.\
  \ We're waiting for meanwhile one aunty came to us and she advised us not to go\
  \ amer fort in the evening it is not safe at all. \nBut we didn't convinced from\
  \ her at all. Cab arrived we were on our way. Now who doesn't know about Amer, let\
  \ me tell you about it, it is a palace situated in Jaipur, it belongs to King wo\
  \ was Rajput from caste and his family was famous for the wars and they have a great\
  \ role in Indian history. Her daughter Jodha got married to a muslim king Akbar\
  \ but she refused to change her caste and religion even after marriage and this\
  \ was a great thing during war days on that time. Their love story is unique and\
  \ special. Her brother had three wives and their rooms were also their in Amer.\
  \ \nBut Amer fort is in mountains like it is not in plains. You have to climb many\
  \ stairs and cover a distance to see the beauty from a height. \nWhen i was crossing\
  \ over i felt confidence and releif. When i reached on the heigh i saw a beautiful\
  \ river, corner of the garden, design and opposite of me was a chimerical temple\
  \ and their you can see the face of peace. The wind got stopped and sunset said\
  \ few lines on leaving us. The cloud was crystal clear and  present opposite uppermost\
  \ point of temple was touching the cloud. People were creating  a sound which was\
  \ peaceful, there was happiness in their souls , ever inch of Amer fort contains\
  \ history. We can't change history, we can't improve it only we can learn from it.\
  \ The view got my soul captured and stopped my mind and compelled my body to stay\
  \ in that place for a while. Then  my friends came and said it's high time to leave\
  \ and we left.\nBut i got to see the face of peace for the first time. And i can\
  \ never forget it. The thing is I never expected that Amer would be this much chimerical."
