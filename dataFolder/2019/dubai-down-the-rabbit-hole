Text: "Woke up and found myself in a daily routine. The usual grind. Comfortably strolling\
  \ through the arms of the clock.\n\nThere must be something more to life! A new\
  \ chapter to boast about. A new challenge waiting to be accomplished. A new part\
  \ of yourself yearning to be discovered.\n\nThat's when I made my decision to quit\
  \ my job, sell my car, entrust my investments and properties to my family and pack\
  \ for Dubai.\n\nThey say New York is a concrete jungle where dreams are made of.\
  \ Then Dubai can be considered a posh and sophosticated factory of new ideas and\
  \ concepts. Take a look at the biggest photo frame in the world or the tallest residence\
  \ called Burj Khalifa. Why not jump from a plane and do it on top of the Palm Jumeirah\
  \ islands. Or maybe offer a step up to the Hospitality industry standards in Burj\
  \ Al Arab and exceed the 5-star rating of any hotel in the world.\n\nStepping down\
  \ from the plane, after a long haul, I stood up stretched and the blaze of heat\
  \ cut through your body like a knife. It was April and am surprised to find the\
  \ temperature to be above 35 degrees Celsius at 10 in the evening. Summers can be\
  \ scorching hot reaching peaks of above 50's according to the weather forecast in\
  \ July and August. Sunscreens have never been considered necessary! On the contrary,\
  \ this creates an opportunity to get that perfect tan for that wandering soul backpacking\
  \ from the west. Oops! That just reminded me that I am indeed in the middle of the\
  \ desert.\n\nBrazil is renowned for its amazing rainforest, the Carnaval, and strong\
  \ culture of soccer and dance. Dubai may not have the plush greens but it does offer\
  \ a magical landscape of brown tones and specks of dust. You can go take that popular\
  \ Desert safari tour where it takes you to a bumpy yet satisfying ride on a 4x4\
  \ then brings everyone together to enjoy a sumptuous meal with a belly dancer ready\
  \ to distract you instantly from that Shawarma plate. Soccer is played through the\
  \ parks and beaches. You should find the locals sitting by the corner street coffee\
  \ shop, puffing on that fragrant hubbly bubbly like there is no tomorrow while watching\
  \ the matches and a lot more variety of sports. Wait a minute...you hear them say\
  \ \"We work hard. We play harder around here.\" Though regulated to a high extent,\
  \ you can find bars and clubs in every hotel. \n\nThank God it's Friday turned out\
  \ to be weird. People in the Middle East work Sundays to Thursdays. Offices, malls,\
  \ shops, supermarkets even the metro runs until midnight. Everybody is pushing their\
  \ luck and trying to make a fortune. Maybe if I make it big in Dubai, they will\
  \ take me more seriously. Cutthroat competition can be seen everywhere. \"Have you\
  \ done your Masters?,\" a high ranking officer of a huge multinational asked me\
  \ once during an interview. They take your experience and credentials very seriously.\
  \ Your residence visa ties you up to your job and your bosses expectations, no matter\
  \ how cruel and unreasonable they get. You need a job to stay here. \n\nIt is a\
  \ melting pot in the Middle East. 85% of the people living in Dubai are expats.\
  \ There are more men than women. Cultures collide but coexist. Different religions\
  \ are respected and recognized. Intercontinental food choices are easily found.\
  \ What brings us all here is that hope for a brightee future. That benefit you get\
  \ from being tax exempt. That voice in the back of your head telling you what if...why\
  \ not...what could possibly be...\n\nOverall, it is that longing to discover and\
  \ take a leap of faith. It is the belief that your life will be better. That one\
  \ shot to discover one's self that pulls us in. I have been living here 7 years\
  \ and will make the same decision all over again. Dubai is one of a kind and proved\
  \ to be a land of promise and opportunity. It was all worth it!"
