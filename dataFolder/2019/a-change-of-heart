Text: "Under the blissful sky, I was watching closely as the plane I\u2019d be flying\
  \ in appeared in front of my eyes. I finally bought a one-way ticket to Bali, Indonesia;\
  \ and along the way to the airport I kept on convincing myself that I need to do\
  \ this. I need to go to a place whose faces I wouldn't recognize. Call it escaping\
  \ or whatever, but I\u2019d counter your argument by saying that I\u2019m going\
  \ to start anew.\n\nThe plane started to take a position for take-off at 5pm. I\
  \ braced myself to take a last good look to a city I grew up in. A city where I\
  \ got my heart broken by the person I loved the most; a city where I found and lost.\
  \ There was a lot of memories, scattered in each of its corners, and I decided I\
  \ wanted a blank canvas.\n\nBy the time the plane was leaving the runway, the sun\
  \ was starting to set. I got a window seat and I put my hands on my face when the\
  \ sun flares hit my eyes.\n\nThere\u2019s something liberating about watching the\
  \ sun slowly goes down, accompanied by the silky clouds and muted noise of the outside\
  \ world. There\u2019s still hope as I was watching one more day was going to an\
  \ end. Maybe I still had one prayer left unsaid, or a love story left untold. But\
  \ as the sky was changing its colors \u2014pink, and blue, and orange collide, I\
  \ felt as free as the evening breeze that kissed the trees gently, unapologetically.\n\
  \nI knew that a rising sun was one evident proof of a new day dawning; a new hope\
  \ rising. But at times like these, proof was a luxury I could not afford.\nI felt\
  \ enough to just sit here in the middle of the transition of daylight and darkness.\
  \ I felt enough to have the privilege to hope, that tomorrow will eagerly come,\
  \ bringing the promises inside their hands. I felt content upon realizing that this\
  \ life wasn\u2019t even mine to begin with, and having a chance to hope for something\
  \ \u2014be it a new day, new heart, or new chances\u2014 is one thing I don\u2019\
  t want to take for granted.\n\nAnd there I was, 38.000 feet above the sea; and I\
  \ didn't expect that I would find the answer.\n\nI found luxury in the hoping. I\
  \ found luxury in the waiting. I found luxury in the stillness, in the silence;\
  \ in the confidence that the promises have been fulfilled already in the pages somewhere\
  \ inside this book, and all I need to do is to keep writing, and reading, and waiting."
