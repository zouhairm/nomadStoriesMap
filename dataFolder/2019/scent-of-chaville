Text: "Something hit my senses in a way that I felt enchanted. There was a heavenly\
  \ scent in the air like somebody had sprayed the whole town with a divine perfume.\
  \ \nThe town of Chaville was not a planned stop.\n \nAfter exploring the enigmatic\
  \ Chateau De Versailles, I had planned to go back to Paris and explore the city\
  \ a bit. \nSince a lot of trains were getting canceled that day due to a strike,\
  \ it was important for me to take the right train to my stop- Paris Montparnasse.\n\
  I reached the Versailles station just in time to take the last train back to Paris.\
  \ \n\u201COn which platform is the train to Paris\u201D, I asked the station guide,\
  \ thinking that all the trains to Paris went to Montparnasse station. \u201CPlatforms\
  \ 2b and 4a have the trains leaving for Paris\u201D, he said. I went to the first\
  \ platform on my way in, 2b, the train on that platform was about to leave. I hurriedly\
  \ asked a boy who was boarding the same train, \u201CIs this train going to Paris?\u201D\
  . \u201CYes\u201D, he said, \u201CParis La Defense\u201D. I hopped on the train.\
  \ It was my first day in Paris thus did not know that La Defense was the name of\
  \ a station far from Montparnasse. \n \nAfter some time I noticed that the train\
  \ was going through a route different than the one I came by. I checked google maps\
  \ and realized that the train was not going to Montparnasse. After exploring a bit\
  \ on maps, I decided to get down at the next station, Gare de Chaville Rive Droite.\
  \ The plan was to walk to the other station and take the train for Montparnasse.\
  \ \nI hadn\u2019t expected to experience anything special in that small town, especially\
  \ something which I would always remember vividly.\n \nIt was late evening when\
  \ I got down at the lonely Gare de Chaville Rive Droite. The sun had set but the\
  \ sky was filled with a yellow glow. There were only two people at the station,\
  \ including me. The evening light was falling on the trees lining the tracks. The\
  \ station looked as if it was the starting point for the trains going to a magic\
  \ land. Tucked between tall trees on both sides, it looked otherworldly.  A cool\
  \ breeze was blowing, filled with a heavenly scent. I took a deep breath and felt\
  \ a sensation going through me. I felt connected to something that can not be seen\
  \ but just felt. It felt as if a veil had been lifted from my senses. I felt happy\
  \ being there. I love the scent of nature but that breeze was something I had never\
  \ experienced before. \n\nI had to walk across the tiny town to Gare de Chaville\
  \ Rive Gauche to board my train. So, I crossed the tracks and went to the other\
  \ side towards the road leading into the town.\nThe walk through the quaint town\
  \ with the beautiful houses in millstone and atypical architecture was mesmerizing.\
  \ The town was simple yet beautiful, filled with a heavenly scent. There were few\
  \ people around, busy in their own lives as if they were used to the breathtaking\
  \ fragrance in the wind.\nI wanted to stay there for a bit long however my train\
  \ was about to come in the next 10 minutes. I inhaled that scent as much I could\
  \ to fill my lungs with the memories of Chaville for my whole life. \nThat day I\
  \ realized traveling is a mixture of planning and improvising. I had planned to\
  \ see the enigmatic Eiffel tower, the beautiful city of Paris, the grand Chateau\
  \ de Versailles but not this. \nThe feeling I had in the town of Chaville would\
  \ stay with me forever. For me, it was like a spiritual experience. I suppose this\
  \ is what traveling is about. Feeling happy and finding unexpected experiences\u2026"
