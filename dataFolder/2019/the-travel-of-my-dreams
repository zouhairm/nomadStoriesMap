Text: "It was September 16, 2012. I was happy yet sad, excited yet depressed, anxious\
  \ yet eager\nto stay at home. I was unable to control my feelings. But surely, I\
  \ knew I was happy that I would finally have stable internet to watch the Korean\
  \ dramas that I loved. I was happy I would no longer have run home from school during\
  \ my lunch break. I struggled to watch an hour-long drama in 35 minutes, which was\
  \ how long my lunch break was. However, when it was time to leave, I didn't see\
  \ myself becoming happy for the same reason anymore. In fact, I still vividly remember\
  \ looking outside the car window as we drove past my village. That village was my\
  \ everything. That was where I had spent almost all of my life. I knew nothing better\
  \ or other than that village.\n\nThe car ride to the airport was quiet. I was looking\
  \ out of the backseat window feeling sentimental. After finally arriving at Addis\
  \ Ababa Bole International Airport, I was excited once again. I forgot all the sentimental\
  \ moments I just had minutes ago. Although I had been at the airport before, I had\
  \ never gone past the security check. I was very excited to finally see what was\
  \ beyond the security check. My excitement faded quickly as the only fascinating\
  \ thing I could find beyond the checkpoint was a wide window that showed airplanes\
  \ take off and land. As I sat down at the waiting area staring at the window, I\
  \ started to think of what the future holds for me.\n\nSoon after, I was walking\
  \ into the plane to fly to Saudi Arabia. Most of the passengers on the plane were\
  \ flying to Saudi Arabia to work as maids. Hence, it's fair to say that I was among\
  \ the very few people that were excited to be on the plane. The atmosphere in the\
  \ plane was gloomy. The majority of passengers looked like they could cry at any\
  \ moment. Meanwhile, I was so excited to be on a plane for the first time ever!\
  \ I was looking around and pressing every button I could find near me. Everything\
  \ seemed enchanting!\n\nThe flight from Saudi Arabia to London went by fast. I fell\
  \ asleep as soon as we got on the airplane and when I woke up, we had already arrived.\
  \ I remember being upset at my parents for not waking me up. \"I missed the airport\
  \ food\" I murmured. It was something I have been looking forward to.\n\nIn London,\
  \ we had to take an hourly shuttle to get to our connecting flight. The ride was\
  \ captivating. The London streets appeared to be cleaner than any street I have\
  \ seen before. I was amused by how pretty the roads were. It was like the Hollywood\
  \ movies that I had watched. We then went through a security check once again and\
  \ boarded our flight from London to Chicago. We were headed to my Aunt's house in\
  \ Berrien Springs, MI. This time around, I managed to stay awake for the first few\
  \ hours. I was able to eat airplane food. It didn't taste as good as I had imagined\
  \ it to be. I was somewhat disappointed.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was already in Chicago\
  \ hugging my Aunt who was waiting for us at the airport. I was glad to finally be\
  \ at a place where I would soon call \u201Chome.\u201D As we were driving to go\
  \ to my Aunt\u2019s house, I was in denial that this place was really going to be\
  \ my new home. The weather was gloomy, but I was delighted to finally live my dream\
  \ life. A life that I had dreamed of living for such a long time. In the car, I\
  \ remembered the conversation that I had with my friend Emnet a day before I left\
  \ Ethiopia.\n\u201CFrom America or Heaven where would you chose to go,\u201D she\
  \ asked me.\n\u201CI want to go to heaven, but still have a long layover in America,\u201D\
  \ I replied\nI giggled as I was dozing off staring at the car window."
