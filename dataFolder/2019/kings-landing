Text: "Have you ever tried to travel without researching about the place that you\
  \ are visiting? Have you ever travelled to a place that is not so popular in the\
  \ media yet its like a hidden gem of that country? We just did last year. Me and\
  \ my fiancee went to Dubrovnik, Croatia and we didn\u2019t expected that Dubrovnik\
  \ is a preserved old town with a very beautiful nature and the filming place of\
  \ the famous tv series like Game of Thrones, Robin Hood, Star Wars, etc. \n\nWe\
  \ only spent 3 days in Dubrovnik yet it felt like we were there for a longer time.\
  \ We took air bnb to save costs in accomodation. We took local transportations to\
  \ feel like a local living in Croatia. We ate Croatian Cuisine which I bet everybody\
  \ will love if you are a seafood lover. We went to each corner of the old town and\
  \ we discovered the history behind it. We interviewed every tourist who came to\
  \ visit Dubrovnik and 10/10 of the tourists are telling us \u201Camazing place\u201D\
  . \n\nI wonder why Croatia isn\u2019t as popular as Switzerland, Italy, etc. Everyone\
  \ is missing Croatia even if you asked them after a year or two nor even longer.\n\
  \nDuring our historical tour we came to know that the prosperity of the city was\
  \ historically based on maritime trade. Dubrovnik was the capital of the maritime\
  \ Republic of Ragusa, it achieved a high level of development, particularly during\
  \ the 15th and 16th centuries, as it became notable for its wealth and skilled diplomacy.\n\
  \nIn 1991, after the break-up of Yugoslavia, Dubrovnik was besieged by Serbian and\
  \ Montenegrin soldiers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) for seven months and\
  \ suffered significant damage from shelling. After repair and restoration works\
  \ in the 1990s and early 2000s, Dubrovnik re-emerged as one of the top tourist destinations\
  \ in the Mediterranean.\n\nI want to make you imagine how it looks like. Dubrovnik\
  \ is a city near the ocean and mountains, it has an old town surrounded by the walls\
  \ of the castle. The people living inside the quarters of the castle are rich and\
  \ are famous. The people living outside the castle are poor and average. When you\
  \ go up the mountain you can see the entire city, some good houses with orange roofs\
  \ inside the castle anre so beautiful to see from the top of the mountain. On your\
  \ left side across the ocean you can find a lush green island called \u201CLokrum\u201D\
  . On your right side you can see the little islands and the coastside with the houses\
  \ outside the castle. \n\nIt is a very stunning during sunset. No one will not love\
  \ its beauty.\n\nCroatia is famous with their beaches. They have a clear water with\
  \ colorful fishes and corals underneath. \n\nAnother thing that I also liked about\
  \ their country is they keep it clean for their environment.\n\nI recommend you\
  \ all to visit Croatia specially when you are visiting its nearby countries like\
  \ Montenegro, Italy, Romania, etc.\n\nWe took a day trip to Montenegro we went to\
  \ Hercegnovi and we come back in the evening. It was a great wanderlusting experience\
  \ having a very lovely vacation in Dubrovnik and visiting another country to be\
  \ added on your travel list.\n\nI encourage everyone - single, lovers, family and\
  \ friends to visit Croatia and create a lasting memories. A great investment for\
  \ a traveller like me. Croatia stays with your heart and even if you aged and become\
  \ the oldest you still can imagine how the Croatian breeze and Croatian Skyline\
  \ gave you that touristy vibes."
