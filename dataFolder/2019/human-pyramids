Text: "Neck to neck with hundreds of strangers, I stared upwards as a helmeted young\
  \ girl climbed four levels of a human pyramid. The tower of people wobbled constantly,\
  \ but its practiced members held tightly to their positions, completely aware that\
  \ any jarring movement would send everyone toppling into the crowd. Everyone around\
  \ me held their breath as the pyramid's star approached the top - she sometimes\
  \ scrambled for a reliable foothold, but still she climbed - and finally victorious,\
  \ she raised her fist as if to celebrate a moment's unity between Catalonian and\
  \ Spanish culture. The crowd cheered and chanted as more of these human pyramids\
  \ began to rise as if by magic. Spain's most anticipated annual celebration, La\
  \ Merce, had just begun.\nWhen my plane landed in Barcelona on September 23rd, I\
  \ had no idea that I'd picked the best weekend of the year to explore the city.\
  \ I was probably alone in my ignorance, because La Merce draws in thousands of tourists\
  \ every year to witness incredible parades, displays of athleticism and patriotism,\
  \ native music, and dazzling fireworks. It's a holiday that holds a history of a\
  \ turbulent clash of cultures, but today, it is more of a celebration of life. With\
  \ friends I'd made the night before, I traveled the streets of a city I'd never\
  \ seen, trying new foods, getting swallowed by crowds, and taking in the beauty\
  \ of spontaneous travel. \nI was having the time of my life, but in the midst of\
  \ the celebration, I remembered the musings of a Scotsman I'd met in Edinburgh -\
  \ he told me of a time in the past, where New Years in Scotland was a family affair,\
  \ where the townspeople took to the streets to drink and make merry til the crack\
  \ of dawn, and how the event had been sold to tourists from around the world. It\
  \ was the realization that I'd become one of those tourists, that made me wonder\
  \ if I was right in reveling in the history of a country that was not mine. \nDespite\
  \ my concern, the locals seemed happy to have me. On La Merce, the bigger the crowds,\
  \ the better.\nI witnessed national news moments after the first successful human\
  \ pyramid, when another attempt was not so successful. Twenty athletes fell to the\
  \ ground when their tower collapsed. It must be thanks to the net of onlookers that\
  \ only one man had to be carried off in a stretcher - and the stunned gasp of the\
  \ audience was only a momentary pause in the celebration of the day."
