Text: "I woke up this morning to the sound of chirping chorchas, howler monkeys and\
  \ crashing waves outside my bedroom. I walked downstairs and could immediately smell\
  \ the fresh coffee and quesadillas that Luis was making. Luis was my Costa Rican\
  \ airbnb host - about 50 years old, with short black hair, a strong build, and a\
  \ friendly smile. He loved having some company to cook and converse with. \n\nI\
  \ was greeted by a gust of salty sea air as I opened up the large steel door that\
  \ separates the kitchen from an uninterrupted view of the beach, the ocean and the\
  \ iguana tree sitting out front. I know what you\u2019re thinking - Iguana trees\
  \ aren\u2019t real! And you would be correct. But Luis planted cactus around the\
  \ base of the tree so these animals would be protected from predators, and thus\
  \ came the \u201CSantuario de Iguanas\u201D. I sipped my coffee and watched Horacio,\
  \ Lizzy, and Godzilla blend effortlessly into the bark with their rough, brown skin\
  \ and the branches with their bright green underbellies. As I watched them climb,\
  \ I felt a wave of gratitude wash over me. Gratitude for my host, gratitude for\
  \ mother nature, and gratitude for having the courage to come on this trip. \n\n\
  Exactly 7 weeks ago, I was lying in bed, when all of a sudden my legs started shaking.\
  \ As I tried to step out of bed, I fell. I tried to get up, and again, I fell. After\
  \ my third attempt, I sat back down on my bed. What was happening? Tears and snot\
  \ streamed down my face uncontrollably. It took thirty seconds for me to realize\
  \ that I was having another multiple sclerosis relapse and my body from the waist\
  \ down was numb. \n\nAfter struggling for one month to regain the ability to walk,\
  \ while working at the job that cared frighteningly little about my health, I decided\
  \ to stop. To stop and finally listen to what my body was telling me it needed -\
  \ to get away. Get away from the toxicity, the chaos and the cold. To feel the sun\
  \ on my skin and sand between my toes. To feel the intensity and peace that comes\
  \ from meeting new people and experiencing a new culture. \n\nThat same day, I let\
  \ go of all the potential conflicts that could ensue, and booked a 10 day trip to\
  \ the land of Pura Vida. Nothing else mattered, this is what I needed.\n\nThe smell\
  \ of the quesadilla ingredients got stronger, and the sound of the crashing waves\
  \ louder as I let the gratitude sink in deeper. Here I was; sun-kissed, content,\
  \ and feeling loved. All because I took this step, and took responsibility for my\
  \ own recovery. \n\nI reflected on the last several days - but what, or should I\
  \ say who, stuck out to me most was Marilyn. \n\nMarilyn is a retired paraplegic\
  \ from Toronto who was spending the month in Playa Hermosa with her husband Gregg.\
  \ I was dumbfounded hearing about this trip. Despite the disability, Marilyn was\
  \ able to go swimming, sightseeing, and even zip lining! I watched her complete\
  \ countless tasks I didn\u2019t think were possible - like typing, holding a fork,\
  \ and drinking on her own - and listened to stories about all the places she\u2019\
  s travelled to. On top of all of that, she managed to have always have this infectious\
  \ positivity about her. \n\nI originally expected sunsets and cervezas from Costa\
  \ Rica, but instead Marilyn helped me find strength, compassion, friendship, and\
  \ perspective. Strength to know that you can and must handle everything that life\
  \ throws at you. Compassion and friendship in the beautiful moments and conversations\
  \ that I shared with practically strangers. And the perspective that if you do what\
  \ feels right to you, no matter how hopeless your circumstances seem, things will\
  \ work out. \n\nThe first step in my journey led me to Costa Rica, which led me\
  \ to Marilyn, and my life will forever be more whole as a result. \n\nMarilyn takes\
  \ forward steps every day, and makes sure that her life is always full of love and\
  \ travel. \n\nWhat steps are you prepared to take, and what life changing place\
  \ will this lead you to next?"
