Text: "Had been saving for months for this trip so that me and a good friend of mine\
  \ could go on a euro trip together. But then things were not as one imagines. He\
  \ bail out on me last minute when my plane tickets already been bought. So it was\
  \ just me and the 12 hours of a plane ride to Spain.\n\n10.30pm local time and I\
  \ didn\u2019t even know the local language there. Feel like a total idiot wondered\
  \ around reading signs and following flock of people that headed in the same direction.\
  \ Excitement and scared all mixed in my body. Feeling lost but still, I am ready\
  \ for the adventure, hoping all to be okay.\n\nThat night was dark but I managed\
  \ to buy a train ticket towards a hostel I booked. Dragging my suitcase to a street\
  \ never I walked before with wheels that are so loud made locals took a peak on\
  \ what the commotion is all about. All that attention made overflowing thoughts\
  \ through my head. \n\nFrom all that darkness comes a light, literally, the hostel\
  \ I booked was super bright. Went inside greeted by the warmest receptionist ever\
  \ and went to my 6 bunk bedroom with a relief.\n\nThe sun was starting to go up\
  \ when then there is a sound of good morning greeting from some unfamiliar sound.\
  \ She was from the US, was super friendly that for a second I thought that I got\
  \ a friend to wondered Barcelona today but then she got a flight to catch soon.\
  \ So, therefore, I am alone again.\n\nBeing a shy person, i sometimes feel hard\
  \ to interact with people. Joining a morning tour helped me a lot, a friendly girl\
  \ approached me and gosh she was the most attentive girl of all. Clicked instantly\
  \ until the point that we are able to ate gelatos together. Besides that along the\
  \ way got many friends and met awesome people to explore the beautiful city of Barcelona.\
  \ Walking through the amazing architectural buildings, catched some churros along\
  \ the way with my new friends from around the world was never something that I dreamt\
  \ about. But some how it was the most amazing thing that i experience last year.\n\
  \nWhereas it was my first accidental solo trip experience. 22 y.o. wondering in\
  \ alone in Spain. Always skeptical about a stranger when suddenly the stigma of\
  \ a stranger was turned 180 degrees."
