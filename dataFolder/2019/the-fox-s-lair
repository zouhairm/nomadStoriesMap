Text: "The trip began when we spent a week in Balne\xE1rio Cambori\xFA (Santa Catarina),\
  \ with my boyfriend's family. Since I've never been there before, I wanted to find\
  \ something fun to do. We found out that Yma (a Brazillian artist) was going to\
  \ perform at the end of our trip. I sent a message to the event's organizer and\
  \ I got a reply: I was going to make the photos of the show! But since we are in\
  \ Brazil and not all jobs have money enough for cach\xE9, she offered me two beers\
  \ and a shirt from the record company... and I said yes. After all, I just wanted\
  \ to make my way as a photographer in distant lands.\n\t The night was great, it\
  \ was raining a lot at the beginning and we almost didn't go but I'm glad we decided\
  \ to. The pub had some Irish vibes, little flags on the walls and two bands were\
  \ playing. Yma, the lead singer, was so kind and we talked so much that she invited\
  \ us to another concert two days later in Curitiba (Paran\xE1). It was great because\
  \ it was on our plans to go there, then we would continue our trip to the state\
  \ of S\xE3o Paulo. All she gave me was the name of the place and date.\n\tAfter\
  \ a brief search on the internet, I found the address of what it could be this \"\
  Raposa\", which means \"Fox\" in Portuguese and we only found out the reason of\
  \ the name when we got there. \nIt was our second time in the city, so we decided\
  \ to go by cab. The cab driver couldn't find the place so he left us on the main\
  \ avenue. We even got into a market and got some beers for our \"fox hunt\". Took\
  \ us fifteen minutes walking plus the cab trip and the market until we found the\
  \ number of the place, but instead of what we were expecting, there was a car workshop\
  \ with the number 94 in chalk. \n\tRight next to it, there was a half-open gate\
  \ that you needed to lean down to see something: an empty hallway, with neon lights\
  \ on the walls, one big black door at the end and a smiling security woman.\nWhen\
  \ she saw our tiny heads, she asked:\n- Are you guys looking for the fox? \nSurprisingly\
  \ we said:\n- Yes! There's no sign of it anywhere...\n- Well, the search is over,\
  \ welcome to the Raposa! And she opened the big black door for us. \n\n\tI couldn't\
  \ believe that two days in Curitiba we would find such an underground place to hang\
  \ out. That's the kind of place I wanna meet while traveling, those native hidden\
  \ places instead of just going for the obvious.  When we entered, it was so unexpected.\
  \ It was maybe part of the car workshop in the past because it looked like one on\
  \ the outside, but on the inside, the walls were really high and the main color\
  \ of them was this olive green mixed with the white and wood shades at the bar.\
  \ It was very stylish, almost like a secret club, with big couches, healthy plants\
  \ and even a small pool in the smoking area! \n\tThe bathroom walls were entirely\
  \ ros\xE9 with some writings on it. The showroom where the magic happens had this\
  \ big and thick door and the place was small but comfy and soundproof. This time\
  \ I could really enjoy the show, instead of just taking photos. Yma's band were\
  \ wearing different shades of red and they looked aesthetic complementing with the\
  \ green walls behind them. Yes, I love colors as we all can see.\n\tAfter the show,\
  \ Edu and I -the boyfriend I only said the name at the end of the story- ended up\
  \ with an idea for a music session, and they loved it. \nSince we are filmmakers,\
  \ this curiosity and hungriness for meeting new people, places and cultures are\
  \ what helped us through this adventure. I'm glad we left the house that day, I'd\
  \ never know I would come back with such a story."
