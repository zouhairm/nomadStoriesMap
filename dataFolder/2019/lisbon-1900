Text: "While I was in Lisbon, I asked a local about the way the city changes affect\
  \ her. She said \"I need to start taking pictures before the landscape I know disappears\"\
  . The real estate market, the rising start-up scene... Sure, Lisbon's soul is threatened.\
  \ It made me think about Lisbon old shops and how most of them have closed their\
  \ doors over the years. The mayor launched a program to support them. It's called\
  \ \"Lojas com Historia\" and it's helping these Lisbon-based mom and pop shops to\
  \ stay open as long as possible. They're a travel back in time - there's the glove\
  \ maker, the candle shop, the old perfume boutique, run by a woman who looks like\
  \ she's been around for a hundred years... And probably will be around for a hundred\
  \ years. \n\nI would love to know the stories behind these shops. More often than\
  \ not, the people who run it have passed it in the family, from one generation to\
  \ the next. Getting an insight into what Lisbon used to be, while being aware of\
  \ what the city is becoming now... It's precisely what I'm interested about. As\
  \ I've talked to many locals while I was in Lisbon, they all seem to be emotionally\
  \ attached to the city's soul and what makes it unique. That's what I want to explore."
