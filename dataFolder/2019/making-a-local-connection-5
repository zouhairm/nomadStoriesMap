Text: "I like bullies. They remind me of who not to become when life beats you up\
  \ and throws curved balls at you... in a sexist macho world full of hate and run\
  \ by bravado, it's easy to become the demons we fight. Notwithstanding the fact\
  \ every negative encounter is chance to explore its polar opposite. Ask yourself,\
  \ every time you've been met with aggression, did you feel the need to justify the\
  \ situation there and then? Well, my experience goes something like this... \nMarch\
  \ 6th 2019, somewhere in the small Cosmopolitan City of Livingstone, around the\
  \ Airport Road area i found myself running away from the demons i left in the Copperbelt.\
  \ They say, \"embrace your inner demons\". But it's easier said than done. How can\
  \ i embrace my inner demons when i'm already having trouble fighting those outside?\
  \ I guess that's the bargain you get for being a misfit, trying so hard to fit in.\
  \ All my life I've just been in search of some hospitality, which is quite hard\
  \ to find nowadays. Especially if you are a 25 year old young African male living\
  \ in a world run by white supremacists. I thought since i come from a very social\
  \ background, it should be easy for me to connect with people. I mean, my dad was\
  \ a Human Resource Manager for Zambia State Insurance Company before he died. Mom\
  \ was forced to hustle through several jobs just to take care of me for a while\
  \ before her passing too: she had me out of wedlock. Only those who've been through\
  \ such intense loss can fathom the pain of losing both your parents at a very tender\
  \ age. I don't know about you but, that's a quite enough childhood trauma to deal\
  \ with as you go through growing pains. And i also feel like it's one of the main\
  \ reasons, my Grandpa died early. He could not deal with the pressure of losing\
  \ his first born daughter due to depression. I don't remember much about him but\
  \ i can remember he would light some cigarettes from time to time and drink some\
  \ alcohol when he was feeling down. \nBut hold on sec, lest i lose you in the stories\
  \ of all my life's drama. This is what occurred on the 6th of March 2019. As Mwewa\
  \ and i left home, we went out in search of some local Tailors. On our way out it\
  \ was a bright and sunny day as the Sun in the Southern province of Zambia is really\
  \ hot. Hot enough to give a black man a tan. We walked for about three to six minutes\
  \ headed south from Home in Robin Street. We stopped by a shop in the neighborhood\
  \ and bought some snacks then continued moving forward. Before we left the shop\
  \ we asked for some directions. And as we kept trekking the dusty roads of the Airport\
  \ Road area, we found ourselves in a road called Botswana road found in Dambwa North\
  \ area. A community right next to the Airport Road neighborhood. Finally, we arrived\
  \ at a T junction where we were faced with a choice of going Right or Left. Without\
  \ much hesitation, we decided to go left though we both felt we should've gone right\
  \ down the street named Botswana Road. Fortunately, before we could go any further\
  \ down the road, we met a School boy who seemed a bit exhausted. We asked him where\
  \ we could find some Tailors and he pointed straight up the road; A direction leading\
  \ up if we had chosen to take the right choice. According to the boy's description,\
  \ there lived a Tailor on the first house right after the first Car wash we'd find.\
  \ Then Bingo! We found the place we were looking for. After finding out the prices\
  \ offered we headed back home. On our way back, we crossed paths with two guys and\
  \ managed to vex one of them all because Mwewa was playing some loud music using\
  \ his Bluetooth speaker. Maybe the hot weather and loud music just don't mix. Either\
  \ way, that day i learned sometimes it's hard making a local connection wherever\
  \ life may take you around the globe."
