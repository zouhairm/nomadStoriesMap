Text: "I decided to do a workaway the summer after graduating college. This led me\
  \ to work at a small bar on the beach in the village of Castara, Tobago. Little\
  \ did I know the amount of charm this village held. Not only the village, the whole\
  \ island \u2014 which was so small, I was able to travel it all in one day. Regardless\
  \ of the size, the island had a large, powerful presence with Caribbean music or\
  \ African drums playing from all different directions, at all times of the day.\
  \ I got to know the villagers and was blessed to have them show me what the village\
  \ offered. A breathtaking scenery everywhere you look was a plus, yes, but the carefree\
  \ spirit and genuine love shown by the locals was a priceless lesson I strive to\
  \ live by every day. The day of week most looked forward to by the locals was an\
  \ event on Sundays refered to as \u2018Harvest\u2019. This was such a powerful occasion\
  \ to experience because the whole island would come together and host a time to\
  \ give. I consider this powerful because I notice how little money the locals have.\
  \ Even so, they make the time and find the money to host for others in numerous\
  \ houses open to the public. I remember first arriving to my workaway asking the\
  \ woman I worked for \u201Cwhat time should I arrive at the bar to work?\u201D,\
  \ \u201CHow late do you want me to work?\u201D, \u201Cis there anything you need\
  \ me to do right now?\u201D \u2014 My manager looked at me and laughed hysterically.\
  \ She responded \u201Choney, you\u2019re on Island time.\u201D I quickly figured\
  \ out exactly what island time meant. Take things as they come. You work when you\
  \ wake up. You wake up whenever you wake up. Time isn\u2019t something to plan for\
  \ or fight against here. It\u2019s simply non exsistant. But most importantly \u201C\
  don\u2019t worry, mon.\u201D \u2014 the phrase I heard consistently throughout the\
  \ trip. I come from such a fast pace world. It was so foreign to come to a place\
  \ where there is truly nothing to worry about. No media, just people coming together\
  \ as they feel. I asked my new friend what time his soccer game started. He also\
  \ chuckeled and said \u201Cwhenever the village starts coming to the field.\u201D\
  \ I went on this trip to relieve stress and find peace. I was aware I was leaping\
  \ into the unknown, therefore I tried to stay as open minded as possible. However,\
  \ I did go there predicting that the beauty and nature of the island would do the\
  \ clearing of my mind. It wasn\u2019t. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the beauty this\
  \ island withholds is unbelievable. The bluest oceans with the most unique beaches.\
  \ But the lessons engraved in my head by the Tobagan locals were the life changing,\
  \ pivotal moments of my life. I learned how to selflessly love, take life as it\
  \ comes, and remove the idea of time. When I refer to \u201Ctime\u201D I\u2019m\
  \ not referring to the necessary scheduled time we unfortunately have to live by\
  \ in regular society. Time often means either the past or the future. If we see\
  \ time as Tobagans see it, as the present, then we allow all life circumstances\
  \ to flow as it should, without stress or worry, mon."
