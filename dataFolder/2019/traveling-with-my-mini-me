Text: "I used to travel a lot when I was on my own... But two years ago I got pregnant!\
  \ And everything  changed in my life. I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to have\
  \ fun, get to know people, that traveling was going to be impossible once she was\
  \ here.... But I was completely wrong! \nI went back to Salta, last year. I toke\
  \ her pram a small bag with our clothes, and we adventure ourselves!!! I used to\
  \ visit the city a lot, I love it! I even lived there for 6 months... \nWe, my daughter\
  \ of almost a year and a half and me, toke a plain, to the International airport\
  \ Mart\xEDn Miguel de Guemes. We stayed in a beautiful hotel ( Portezuelo) nearby\
  \ the Cerro San Bernardo, surrounded by nature. We choose that hotel because was\
  \ in the middle of the city but away from the noise.... So we went walking everywhere.\
  \ The city is not to big, and is peaceful. Ideal to go for a walk. I strongly recommend\
  \ to visit the Cathedral in front of the \u201CPlaza 9 de Julio\u201D, a park that\u2019\
  s full of lovely cafeterias were you can try a typical sandwich called \u201CChacarero\u201D\
  .  There\u2019s a hill called \u201CTres Cerritos\u201D where you can find a miraculous\
  \ virgen. Up there they have one of the best views of the city. The other hill is\
  \ San Bernardo where you can always find runners and tourists, and in the upper\
  \ point there\u2019s a bar with a beautiful view to enjoy the landscape\nOnce you\
  \ get to know the main city, I recommend you to take the day trips the tourist agencies\
  \ offers you to Cafayate or Cachi... Both of them are amazing! The bus gets you\
  \ in your hotel and takes you back there. And it\u2019s a kind of hop on hop off,\
  \ because stops in many beautiful spots so you can delight yourself with the scenery...\
  \ This little stops makes the day trip kids friendly! My daughter was amazed by\
  \ the landscapes and the animals she got to see. We had a really nice trip together!\
  \ You can totally travel the world, even being a single mother! \nOur next stop\
  \ together? Cataratas del Iguaz\xFA, in a few months..../"
