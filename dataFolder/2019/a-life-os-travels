Text: "Travel is not about travel, but yes about being kid. But, why kid? \nBecause\
  \ the act of travel is one of the few in the world that is indifferent from person\
  \ by person. Not mattering the age, genre, or financial condition. Travel is about\
  \ know new places and things, habits and foods, it's about discover the world and\
  \ at the same time yourself. \nIt's about having the heart throbbing strong, that\
  \ cold in the belly at the time of getting on the airplane, about imagine all the\
  \ time in how the destine of the travel really is, about go along the change of\
  \ sights in car's travel, and finally, it's about go out of the routine. \nKids\
  \ have brightness on the eyes, and all for them is new, excitant and funny. Travel\
  \ is like this, bring out the cool anxiety and the hand's sweat.\nReceive a presente\
  \ is amazing, but is nothing as well as the moment when you finally put the feet\
  \ in that soft sand in a beautiful shore with your family, or when you and your\
  \ girlfriend arrive in the hotel and have that relief of unpack the bags and finally\
  \ know the city. \nLeave the routin is make something different, and being about\
  \ travels, each travel is different from the last one, no mattering the destiny,\
  \ the travel buddy, or the time that it have. Getting out of the rut is always very\
  \ incredible, is not it? Travel would not different. \nIf you are asking yourself\
  \ about what my favorite trip(or not too, anyway), i will tell you. I Have a trip\
  \ that never leave my head, that was when I knew Rio de Janeiro for the first time,\
  \ right here in Brazil. And even being brazilian, I\u2019ve never been in love with\
  \ RJ, until I know the city.\nIt was a perfect travel, but not for had being all\
  \ perfect, on the contrary. I lost my bag in the airport, and our flight was canceled\
  \ two times by excess of mist. But despite everything, I still feel the good vibrations\
  \ of the place, and when I close my eyes I remember the moments that i lived there,\
  \ especially with mt father.  \nSince when I get on the taxi and felt the winds\
  \ in my hair while the car crossed the city, until the climbing up to the Christ\
  \ the Redeemer and the glorious moment on that I finally put my hand on those marble\
  \ stones and admire that stunning sight, or when I got myself listening Samba and\
  \ drinking Chopp on the edge of Copacabana Beach, in one hot night with a clean\
  \ and starry sky. \nIt's by memories like that I feel enchanted or excited in every\
  \ trip I make, no matter the destination. There are few things that nobody can take\
  \ away from us, one is knowledge, and the other are memories. And when it comes\
  \ to travel, we get several of them, one more unforgettable and wonderful than the\
  \ other.\n That's why I always say, travel. To learn, to know, to grow, and to be\
  \ happy."
