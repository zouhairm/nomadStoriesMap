Text: "Once I stand on a platform with a train ticket in my hands I know exactly what\
  \ will happen, I just wonder how. There is nothing particular I want to see and\
  \ those are just a few stations along the line of Cascais that I am going to take,\
  \ but I feel I am running out of time and I am certain there is something about\
  \ to happen. So when the train finally arrives and the doors open, I make my steps\
  \ inside the compartment with a conviction of someone who is about to face a moment\
  \ of truth.\n\tPolitely I meander my way among the passengers until I find a free\
  \ seat somewhere next to a window and before the train has started to move, I have\
  \ taken out my notebook to not miss a thought once the scenes on either side of\
  \ the window start to unfold. The deadline is in a couple of days and all I have\
  \ are a bunch of half-finished paragraphs that refuse to come together.\n\tBut as\
  \ the train picks up some speed and blue becomes a more and more prominent part\
  \ of the view and landscape, my pen and mind get in motion again. People get it\
  \ and out and I am happy to turn back and forth the pages making additions and editions\
  \ to some lines about paths going up and down, the power of light and palette of\
  \ colors and different kinds of longing. All precious fragments and pieces gathered\
  \ during the last days in Lisbon and by the time my stop comes, the notebook is\
  \ more full, but the texts appear messier than before.\n\n\tOnce my stop comes and\
  \ I exit the train I can feel the wind of Atlantic Ocean in my face and I know I\
  \ am close to what I came for. My steps pick up some speed and rhythm and in no\
  \ time, I am at the beach, taking off my shoes to get the feel of the sand. I lay\
  \ down a Kanga and while putting my notebook within an easy reach, I sit down to\
  \ gaze first in the horizon and then left and right trying to visualize where the\
  \ Ocean might start and end.\n\tThere is not much success with this exercise either,\
  \ but the sun still has a long way to go and the tide will stay at a distance as\
  \ well. If I want I can spend hours like this and just in case, there are a coat,\
  \ scarf, and snacks in my backpack to prolong the moment as long as I need. I hope\
  \ it won\u2019t take that long and in search of that something I turn my stare then\
  \ at feet and sand, then the ocean, waves, and horizon, and then back to feet and\
  \ sand again. And as I amuse myself, my mind keeps on asking -  if I ever have seen\
  \ anything as big and powerful as the ocean?\n        I try to recite some options,\
  \ but the wind and breaking waves not only sideline the sounds of passing trains\
  \ and cars but also of my thoughts. And then, as someone dedicated to not leave\
  \ anything for later, I get up and take off my clothes until I am left with nothing\
  \ but my swim shorts and start running towards the water.\n\n\n\tThe first steps\
  \ are like a shock of cold, after all, it is the beginning of March, and at this\
  \ point, it does not seem like a good idea anymore, but I keep on the speed and\
  \ inertia and once the water reaches the navel I make a dive into the water. A couple\
  \ of seconds later, I surface, my body is shivering, but the face is opened in a\
  \ smile as I exclaim aloud:\u2019Ahhhh!\u2019\n\tI look back at the coast and pastel-colored\
  \ houses, then towards the horizon melting different kinds of blue and then again\
  \ back to the beach and my things in the sand. My smile becomes even wider,  I know\
  \ exactly what to do next."
