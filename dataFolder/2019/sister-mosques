Text: "A beautiful capital of India, Delhi has been the arriving destination from\
  \ decades now for travellers having urge to sink in diversity of culture.\nWhy Delhi?\
  \ As it's the capital of Incredible India? Well, indeed but there's more to it.\
  \ Delhi has a great impact on the world in field of philosophy and literature.\n\
  Being a traveller in search of interesting literature it's was my first journey.\n\
  It took me around twelve hours to reach the Delhi train station from Lucknow. Heading\
  \ towards my hotel notice an essence of people's hardship on my way to hotel. \n\
  It was friday, my dream to feel the overwhelming faith of thousands of people praying\
  \ altogether at Jama Masjid, Delhi. I went to the metro station which wasn't that\
  \ far from my hotel and headed to the Mosque.\nJama Masjid Delhi gives me goosebumps\
  \ whenever i think of it. A huge mosque with three giant dooms and minars. Beautiful\
  \ architecture but what excites me is the time this mosque faced, the era of emperors,\
  \ the age of britishers, the phase of freedom-fighters and today's democracy. The\
  \ soul of this mosque has lots of experience which one can feel just by feeling\
  \ the walls.\nMy heart felt deep loneliness that this huge mosque was bearing, sadness\
  \ of getting apart from her sister mosque, The Badshahi Mosque of Lahore.\nThese\
  \ two were the two great mosques of India when there wasn't any partition. They\
  \ share a bond through people. The merchants and travellers offering prayers at\
  \ Badshahi Mosques arrives at Jama Masjid after long journey and offers prayer.\
  \ They bring some soul part of mosque and the mosque gets to know about each other's\
  \ wellness and peoples.\nThis love got blocked by borders. The sisters got parted\
  \ and even though the faithful ones still offers the prayers in them, they can't\
  \ let go each other's heart.\nThe feeling rushes through wall to my hand and to\
  \ heart. Soul of the Jama Masjid is beautiful, sensitive and needs love. Appreciating\
  \ the architecture is lovely but feeling the foundation and memories a monument\
  \ possess is spiritual connection to it. I couldn't manage to feel a faithful gathering\
  \ of friday prayer but the people rushing out after prayer on my gate to staircase\
  \ in traditional garments takes me back in time of mughals. I went inside and cleanse\
  \ myself from the pond of cleansing, where every believer washes of the hand and\
  \ face before offering prayer. The pond of cleansing connects believer with each\
  \ other's too. Washing themself with the same water band regardless of caste, color,\
  \ status, race is respect to humanity.\nAfter getting puried I steps inside the\
  \ main doom , with each step I feels the sandstone stairs and the soul of mosque\
  \ welcoming me as a believer. I offer my prayer and tried to feel the spiritual\
  \ vortex a mosque hold. My tears werent stopping and the reason was unknown, I guess\
  \ my connection with people who offered prayers with heart in here allowing me to\
  \ feel their emotions.\nIt was heart opening experience and never ever felt getting\
  \ my faith this strong.\nTouring a little and walking barefeet calmed me so much,\
  \ the peace is what i truely acquired.\nThis faithful journey paid all my years\
  \ of studying about faith and literature.\nPeace is the most valuable thing in the\
  \ world which one can achieve if they wills and this beautiful architecture helps\
  \ them achieve it.\nI pray that the loneliness of these beautiful architectural\
  \ sisters vanish away and they can hear about each other again soon.\nAmeen"
