Text: "Four lanes of back-to-back traffic stretch endlessly in front and behind our\
  \ Uber. Like all the other drivers we've encountered, he is a born-and-bred local.\
  \ Many years have faded his excitement for the Carnival season and overlaid a jaded\
  \ hue onto the glittering greens, golds, and purples.  Screaming sirens suddenly\
  \ are insistent behind us. Cars pull the few inches aside they can muster. A police\
  \ escort of schoolbuses squeeze by, filled to the brim with the unrecognizable painted\
  \ and leering masked faces that will soon be manning the parade floats. Suddenly,\
  \ the beads hanging from the driver's rearview mirror clink together as he swerves\
  \ into the gap left by the tail of the police escort.\n\"Keep it tight, baby!\"\
  \ he exclaims as we are suddenly easily gliding past all the traffic that has parted\
  \ like the Red Sea. Other drivers try to follow his lead. \"No, you're not gettin'\
  \ in, baby! I'ma sue your ass!\" he guffaws, keeping a good centimeter's following\
  \ distance to the police car in front of us.\n\nThe Uber driver may have cleared\
  \ the traffic, but even he can't get us past the street blockades as the dancers\
  \ in the parade warm up in the unseasonable 35 degree Louisiana weather. We slip\
  \ into the only cafe open for miles and order pour-over coffee. \n\"You want a shot\
  \ of Jamison or Bailey's in that?\" The barista asks. It's nine in the morning.\n\
  Just what have I gotten myself into?\n\nAs an introvert, environmentalist, and straightedge\
  \ vegan, New Orleans on Mardi Gras is probably the last place you'd expect to find\
  \ me. There are signs for po\u2019boys every few feet it seems, and you can get\
  \ anything on a stick from crawfish to gator. Roll carts overflowing with trash\
  \ dot every block. In certain spots, the ground is the trashcan, and in a city that\
  \ doesn't recycle glass curbside, watching your step is imperative. \nBut it's not\
  \ called the Big Easy for nothing. The pace of the city is slow, relaxed, with a\
  \ decadent lazing in the heavy heat of the sun. Every porch has rocking chairs or\
  \ swings. Cats lounge in the street, their slow blinking eyes following the dart\
  \ of geckos over the walls. The drawn-out Southern drawl espouses deep Southern\
  \ pride and hospitality.\nDuring Carnival season, people drunk on some amalgamation\
  \ of life and spirits dance in the streets, heedless of the ambitious cars that\
  \ try to squeeze through the narrow one-way lanes. They laugh in the face of impatient\
  \ honking and create a spectacle of roadblock breakdancing. Kids set up shop on\
  \ front stoops with upturned buckets and drum their hearts out.\nNew Orleans is\
  \ a city of contradictions: The aged and cracked wrought iron fences slung with\
  \ very bright, shiny, and new plastic beads. The incessant noise of the French quarter\
  \ vs the quiet peace of the swamplands. \n\nAbout 25 miles outside the city, the\
  \ noise of the revelry fades away and is replaced with the thrum of airboat motors.\
  \ The bubbling water laps against crisscrossing roots tangled in mud and leaning\
  \ precariously, gnarled and humped in groups that look like monks in supplication.\
  \ Herons step carefully through the shallow waters. This is a land of cypress trees\
  \ coated in Spanish moss, of gator snouts poking out of the water, of centuries\
  \ of family generations buried above-ground. The swamp guides look more at home\
  \ on the water than land.\n\nI was surprised to find pockets of a burgeoning progressive\
  \ movement blooming in neighborhoods around the city. I snapped pictures of stickers\
  \ protesting everything from capitalism to police to pipelines in Louisiana. Graffiti\
  \ in the Bywater district proclaims that AirBnB and gentrification are the new \"\
  underground railroad\". Vegan takes on quintessential soulfood dishes are surprisingly\
  \ easy to come by.\nThere is truly something for everyone. The nature-lover, the\
  \ anarchist, the jazz enthusiast.\nI learned to give places a chance, and keep my\
  \ eyes peeled for the hidden character of a place on quiet backstreets and amidst\
  \ burbling swamps.\n\u201CDo you know what it means to miss New Orleans?\u201D a\
  \ sign in an espresso bar queries. Yes, I think as the final palm tree drops out\
  \ of view of the plane. I think I do."
