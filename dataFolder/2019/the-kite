Text: "I first planted the soles of my feet upon the soil of Newfoundland in 2000.\
  \ The air was strange - I had never smelled air so salty and sweet. Coming from\
  \ the Mainland I was use to industrial air; the scent of pollution.\nBefore first\
  \ arriving in Newfoundland, I was a little skeptical. I heard it was homey: a cabin-style,\
  \ small town life. I figured out rapidly that people here were quick, and the beauty\
  \ of the cabin-style life they had described was beyond mere explanation.\nAfter\
  \ 10 years I have travelled all around the country, and since I first came to Newfoundland,\
  \ I have been trying to place exactly why my heart cannot seem to stop filling with\
  \ pride over it. Without a doubt, one of the many reasons is the people.\nTo describe\
  \ them, their culture, would take a lifetime. For me on the other hand, it will\
  \ take just a moment. When I think of my life I often have the same vision. Picture\
  \ a lost kite: they flow through the sky; they are just drifters - unaware of where\
  \ they will fall. I am a 26 year old travelling man, a kite that flies without a\
  \ destination.\nThe title Hitchhiker means something different to everyone ... To\
  \ me it is simply my life. The title holds the key to my existence, and carries\
  \ with it all of my travels. I never plant my feet in one place for long, but to\
  \ say the least, the soles of my feet lay comfortably on Newfoundland soil.\nHere,\
  \ I love to overstay my welcome. The sun may be scarce but it shines through in\
  \ the bonds I have made here. I hold a lot of value and truth in my gut instincts.\
  \ So, when the pit of my stomach connects with my heart and mind in a wrenching\
  \ way, I know in my soul that it is time to say goodbye.\nGoodbyes are hard and\
  \ the hardest is saying them to Newfoundland. Let me indulge in why.\nA no-brainer\
  \ is the scenery, Newfoundland is the embodiment of beauty, and along the coastlines\
  \ to the heart of its forest it never loses an ounce of splendour. A structured\
  \ sight for the eyes are the towns of Newfoundland, misshapen houses nestled together\
  \ that are all entitled as true homes. Then there is the nature of Newfoundland\
  \ itself: I like comparing it to the ocean - calm yet dramatic, currents of change\
  \ and stills of the permanent. ``Newfoundland`` calls loud and clear that the name\
  \ alone means, and forever has meant, happiness \u2013 home"
