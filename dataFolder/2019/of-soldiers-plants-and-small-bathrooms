Text: "This is the story of how I fell in love with a tiny bathroom.  In my hometown\
  \ of Montreal a famous playwright coined the term \u201Cbalconville\u201D to describe\
  \ the old cultural phenomenon of outside living - a rural and urban pass-time during\
  \ the brief summer months. When the good weather arrived, everyone migrated onto\
  \ their balconies and porches like birds that had flown south.  In black and white\
  \ documentaries you can watch hundreds of people out smoking and drinking, talking\
  \ to nearby balcony inhabitants about hockey and politics.  When my grandmother\
  \ told me stories of this when I was growing up it sounded strangely idyllic and\
  \ far away.  That is, until I traveled across Scandinavia in 2017.  \n\nIn a mid-July\
  \ heat wave, I found myself alone in Copenhagen for a few weeks, a welcome and unexpected\
  \ gap in my plans.  I\u2019ve always found that traveling alone opens unsuspected\
  \ vistas into cultures and landscapes. It is strange, but it is always small things\
  \ that mark a trip; the little details that wouldn\u2019t make it into a tourism\
  \ brochure.  On my first visit to Denmark\u2019s insular metropolis, after a few\
  \ transit hiccups, I finally found my way into Norrebro district at warm sunset.\
  \  Winding down the lip of several streets I slowly took in the rows of homogeneous\
  \ brick buildings.  They were lined up like sleeping soldiers in the dusky light.\
  \  Languidly, I made my way into one of the same-colored doorways, up a flight of\
  \ narrow stairs to the fourth floor, and was greeted by a key under the doormat\
  \ and a sticky-note. The apartment took no time to explore, a charming study in\
  \ minimalism.  Then, I walked into the only place in the apartment that had a door,\
  \ the bathroom.\n\nI spent most of my days in Copenhagen riding a bicycle from island\
  \ to mainland on impeccably wide geometric cycling lanes, napping at Rosenberg Castle\u2019\
  s blooming rose garden, drinking beer and coffee on hot sunny terraces, and talking\
  \ to locals about nothing and everything.  I found that the Danes are proud of their\
  \ Lilliputian homes and love doing their living out.  Everyone I met were plants,\
  \ fueling up on sun.  All matter of household items were scattered about outside,\
  \ some falling into the canals, others peppering sidewalks, parks, and public establishments.\
  \  One day as I walked along Norrebrogade I spotted a group of men carrying a sofa\
  \ out of a doorway, they laughed and chanted loudly.  I followed them and they soon\
  \ arrived at a bar with large windows.  They positioned the sofa directly in front\
  \ of the window that gave view to a large television.  I went in, a football game\
  \ was about to begin. The bar was crowded and small, very much an eclectic living\
  \ room. Blue, red, green chairs everywhere. Velvet, wood, and a few Ikea lamps.\
  \  Some people had brought food from home or the market, others ordered take-out.\
  \ Some solitary patrons sat at the bar reading novels and newspapers, a couple at\
  \ a window played chess.  I decided all I needed was a few beers for complete happiness.\n\
  \nI got to visit a few different homes during my time in Copenhagen.  I have always\
  \ been curious about how other people\u2019s homes looked, maybe everyone feels\
  \ that way. It was especially fascinating how functional and creative Danish apartments\
  \ were.  Someone told me that most of the inner-city residential buildings were\
  \ built in the 18th and 19th century industrial boom.  With little variety in appearance\
  \ they are very pragmatic and communal. However, one thing was not considered\u2014\
  one shared toilet per floor, no private facilities.  The trouble of pipework came\
  \ later, and people had to get creative.  Each place I visited had its own idiosyncratic\
  \ solution.  I\u2019ve witnessed waterproof toiletries and hide-away sinks, and\
  \ in my own temporary bathroom I had to remove everything to take a shower. The\
  \ shower head was directly above the toilet and a hole in the floor to drain the\
  \ water.  For some reason, this was a revelation to me.  \n\nIn my mind, it is impossible\
  \ not to yoke these experiences together. These tiny bathrooms are so symbolic of\
  \ community, creativity, and storytelling.  There is something so infinitely nostalgic\
  \ about a small space."
