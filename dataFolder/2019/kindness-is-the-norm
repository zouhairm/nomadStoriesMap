Text: "\u201CI just want a bottle of water\u201D I stepped away from the basket of\
  \ candy extended in my direction. I was not going to fall prey to these tricks of\
  \ touristic commerce.\n\u201CNo problem\u201D He packs a bottle and throws in two\
  \ handfuls of candy in the shopping bag. \u201CFor your journey\u201D he smiles.\
  \ I walk out at a brisk pace wanting to avoid any parting entreaties to buy his\
  \ wears. None comes.\nI congratulate my sense of cynicism and pay little thought\
  \ to the gesture of the shopkeeper.\nOver the next few days unique incidents happen.\n\
  As we drive from the dead sea towards Petra, our GPS navigation gives up on us.\
  \ We find ourselves on an undulating road stretching towards infinity, green grass\
  \ on the sides, no houses or visible signs of life. As the flaming yellow of the\
  \ afternoon dissolves to crimson, a precursor to the impending dusk, we realise\
  \ we are lost.\nWe see a family wrapping up what seems like a picnic, putting back\
  \ things in their beat up car. \u201CLets see if they can guide us\u201D\nWe approach\
  \ them and realise neither of us speaks each others\u2019 language. Resorting to\
  \ gestures we seek directions to Petra. They point the way, and before we can head\
  \ back to the car, the lady of the family pours hot tea into two small porcelain\
  \ cups decorated with Arabic calligraphy. She holds them out for us to drink. We,\
  \ city dwellers, cynics and opportunists, are stunned by this gesture.\n\u2018Surely\
  \ they are not expecting something in return\u2019, I think to myself and they aren\u2019\
  t. They bid us safe journey and we thank them, each in our own language.\nAs we\
  \ journey onwards we are greeted with multiple such gestures of kindness, and we\
  \ realise that kindness demanding nothing in return is an alien concept to us.\n\
  Our last stop is Wadi Rum, the great expansive desert. We spend the day dune bashing,\
  \ sand boarding, and exploring the vastness of the red sanded dessert in a 4*4.\
  \ At night we barbecue and dance under the stars. We call it a day by retreating\
  \ to the common tent where we sit down around the fire with a hookah and drink unending\
  \ glasses of tea.\nIn the morning it is time to leave. I go to the reception to\
  \ make the payment. I offer my credit card.\nAbdul, the proprietor smiles apologetically\
  \ \u201CSorry no card machine, only cash.\u201D\n\u201COh! Is there an ATM nearby?\u201D\
  \ I already know the answer. I am in the heart of untarnished dessert. The nearest\
  \ town is 2 hours away. I am panicking now.\n\u201C Don\u2019t worry, where are\
  \ you going next?\u201D\n\u201CAmman\u201D \n\u201COk..so maybe you could give money\
  \ to my friend in Amman?\u201D\nAmman is a 4 hours drive from here but Abdul is\
  \ ok with us leaving without making the payment, trusting us, the idea of us reneging\
  \ and disappearing into thin air not bothering him. No where in the world would\
  \ this be accepted.\n\u201CTake my friend\u2019s number, you can give him the money\u201D\
  \ unperturbed he smiles at us.\n\nThe first thing we do on reaching Amman is withdraw\
  \ money from an ATM. The guilt of the trust placed in us gnawing at our souls. We\
  \ establish contact with his friend. He is a genial young Jordanian with a disarming\
  \ smile. He accepts the money and insists on taking us for tea. He calls Abdul at\
  \ the camp to confirm receipt of the money. He hands over the phone to me.\u201D\
  \ Abdul wants to speak with you\u201D\n\u201CHi Abdul thanks\u2026\u201D \nAbdul\
  \ cuts me mid-way. \u201CThank you so much and I am so sorry for causing so much\
  \ trouble. Hope you have a great trip going ahead and a safe journey back home.\u201D\
  \nIt should have been me to apologise.\nI am lost for words. I also lost my cynicism\
  \ and desire to rationalise every act of kindness I was subject to. Without expecting\
  \ it I had found a people who were kind and trusting while seeking nothing in return.\
  \ It changed me, now I try to be better, thinking back to the people who unconditionally\
  \ opened their hearts to a stranger like me."
