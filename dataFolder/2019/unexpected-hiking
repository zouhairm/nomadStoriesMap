Text: "I didn't expect to find myself hiking with the locals in Guam, into a cave,\
  \ in a private land, to find an underground waterfall.\n\nWent to Guam to enjoy\
  \ the beach, as people do. Love for hiking made me surfing the internet about it.\
  \ I found a local hiking community, and read their posting about hiking in a cave\
  \ in a private land to find an underground waterfall. A bit anxious but curios,\
  \ my adventurous blood boiled and I found myself signing in.\n\nThe hike started\
  \ by entering a private land, into the bush, then a swamp land. Soon we were welcomed\
  \ by strange sound from singing poisonous frogs as per our white haired guide. There\
  \ was no actual path except the one our guide just made ahead for us. Fortunately\
  \ we didn\u2019t have to plunge into the dark colored pond we didn\u2019t know what\
  \ were under, instead we surrounded it.\n\nAbout ten minute walk in the mud, we\
  \ saw the cave opening where the water flow in. We stepped in the dry part of the\
  \ cave, switching on our headlights, then crawled into the darkness saying goodbye\
  \ to the sunny world. Some places were so narrow that we had to squeeze and bend\
  \ our bodies to fit the holes. There was a big room in the cave where we took a\
  \ bit rest, before climbing steep down toward the center of the earth. After a while,\
  \ we had to jump into water of the underground river to proceed. We walked following\
  \ the water flow and saw some incredible stalactites, then arrived at the upper\
  \ part of the waterfall.\n\nThough the waterfall was only about three meter high,\
  \ the climbing down was challenging with the stream pouring into us. The pool below\
  \ the fall was too deep for our feet to touch the ground that we had to swim floating\
  \ or catch the surrounding rock. The water path continued a while till we could\
  \ not proceed further and had to turn back. Felt relief when we were back into the\
  \ light.\n\nThe unexpected trip might be wet and muddy, but it was an unforgettable\
  \ lifetime experience."
