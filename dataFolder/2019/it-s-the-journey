Text: "I jerk awake from an unplanned, midday snooze while I am still on the boat.\
  \ Everything around me is soaked in a yellow haze, the suns rays dropping like a\
  \ waterfall onto the canvas shielding our vessel from above. It takes a second for\
  \ me to really come to, busting through the layer of salt now adhered to my face\
  \ and eyelashes, ocean spray having been the only relief from the heat of this long\
  \ morning.\n\n\u201CYa llegamos a Tigre,\u201D the captain shouts over the drum\
  \ of the motor. I look at his face, light brown and sweetly kissed by the sun, plump\
  \ and flushed like a 50\u2019s style Santa Claus figurine. The Tang-colored fruit\
  \ pulp finger-painted onto his cheeks provides sun protection, and reminds me where\
  \ I am. We are arriving to my destination now. \n\nI first caught a glimpse of Isla\
  \ Tigre, when I saw a break in the horizon. We are speeding along Panama\u2019s\
  \ northeastern coast, home to the Guna Yala comarca, a 232-mile stretch of sovereign,\
  \ indigenous land where lush forest meets the Caribbean Sea. This is the home of\
  \ the Guna people, and it is enchantingly beautiful. The majority of Guna reside\
  \ on 38 of the 365 islands that dot the coastline, or in one of 13 villages on the\
  \ mainland. Elsewhere in the expanse of blue are islets consisting of porcelain\
  \ sand and coconut palms, and islands designated for tourism and handicraft vending,\
  \ an important industry bridging tradition with present day needs. \n\nUsually,\
  \ foreigners aren\u2019t allowed to visit residential islands in Guna Yala. The\
  \ Guna fiercely protect their natural resources, culture and intellectual property.\
  \ Therefore, home and tourism are separated, as determined by the Guna General Congress,\
  \ a flourishing example of participatory democracy in today\u2019s world. Even though\
  \ I got permission to enter from a Guna conservation non-profit called CENDAH, my\
  \ chances to photograph everyday life were still limited. Besides, I was invited\
  \ for the sea grass and other matters of the underwater world, which I could photograph\
  \ freely despite my earthly fascinations. \n\nAs we pull up to Tigre, I see no one.\
  \ Huts made of sugar cane and palm fronds are packed onto this tiny blip in the\
  \ sea, the edges brimming with patchwork docks and outhouses. The island seems to\
  \ be overflowing, and the anxiety of arriving creeps in on me. After taking the\
  \ queasy trip from Panama City through the roller-coaster-like mountain road that\
  \ reaches Guna territory, only to miss the single passenger boat of the day, I almost\
  \ didn\u2019t make it here. Thankfully, gracious seamen found me, fed me a mean\
  \ sancocho for lunch (the homiest soup of chicken, potatoes, corn, taro and yucca)\
  \ and coordinated my VIP seat on a shipping boat. I should have been relieved that\
  \ the Universe conspired with me that day, but I was scared. As we neared the island,\
  \ I discovered the edge of what I had always considered my limitless comfort zone.\n\
  \nWe dock the boat, and I grab a pink Northface daypack and a glossy, black plastic\
  \ bag containing research supplies. Fumbling through my belongings for hidden cash,\
  \ I manage to find a 10-dollar bill without revealing too much. I pay my humble\
  \ chauffer, who is now free to complete his intended mission of delivering a boatful\
  \ of beer to the border agents all the way down the coast. \n\nFinding  my bearings,\
  \ I look up to find several almond-shaped eyes examining me. \u201CEdilberto?\u201D\
  \ I chance. I impulsively fret whether I will be welcomed, who will be my guide,\
  \ what I\u2019ll eat and simply how the next 2 weeks will unfold. The moment is\
  \ suspended in time and I\u2019m lost for words. Thankfully someone hears me and\
  \ retrieves the man who will become my host father. We start to walk.\n\nHaving\
  \ received excessive help with carrying my belongings, still unsure of everything,\
  \ I amble on the well-maintained path of the island with my entourage. Taking the\
  \ opportunity to scan my surroundings, I notice naked children gazing at me in awe,\
  \ and I secretly study women dressed in colorful molas, printed sarongs and intricate\
  \ panels of beaded jewelry that coat their forelimbs like tattoos. \n\n\u201CMeh-gan,\
  \ estamos.\u201D I snap out of it.\n\nMeghan, we\u2019re here."
