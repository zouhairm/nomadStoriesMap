Text: "The Earth Globe.\nIt was a warm Friday night at the beginning of the Mexican\
  \ spring and I was coming back from a long and stressful day at the office. I could\
  \ feel the heat increasing and my mood melting down. Fortunately, my brother and\
  \ two friends were at home having some beers, I sat with them, had a beer, chilled\
  \ and talk with them. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I got distracted by a colorful earth\
  \ globe that caught my eye. \u201CWho does it belong to?\u201D I asked, but nobody\
  \ answered, they were all busy talking. I took it carefully with both hands because\
  \ I wanted to remind me where Portugal was. As soon as I took it, my eyes were drawn\
  \ to Latin America, I put a smile upon my face and a thousand of good memories from\
  \ the past, upon my head.  However, I did not have time to reflect on them for long\
  \ because one of the lads asked me something. I carefully put the planet down and\
  \ answered.\nOnce we had finished, I took it back and moved to the other hemisphere\
  \ of the world.  I stopped in Portugal for a while, then went backwards to Ireland,\
  \ over to Italy, down to Africa, Antarctica and then all over the world.  Later\
  \ that night I went out with the lads to have a couple of drinks. On the way I bought\
  \ a few cigarettes to use as an excuse to be alone. I did not want to talk much\
  \ that night because I wanted to think about my travels.\nWhen I smoked my first\
  \ cigarette, the first thing that came into my head was that night in the Pacific\
  \ Ocean of Costa Rica when I talked to the Polish guy while the monkeys were making\
  \ noises.  He said to me: \n\u201CWhen I travel I like to write because it allows\
  \ you to live on three times, firstly is reality, secondly, you recreate everything\
  \ when you write it down, and finally, when you read it, you go back to those moments,\
  \ it is like some kind of magic.\u201D\nWhen I had my second cigarette I thought\
  \ of those nights I had in Ireland inventing kids\u2019 stories, with the innocent\
  \ expectation of a child wanting to hear tales. That memory connected with another\
  \ one in Colombia. I remembered one night on the bus being excited hearing my friend\
  \ talking about the devil and the shoes of a cute little traveler, I loved that\
  \ story.   Another memory was the night we ate Mexican food with a friend that owned\
  \ a hostel in Patagonia who was also a writer for a magazine. Having left our friends\
  \ in the bar, my brother and I walked back home. The air got fresh, I lit up my\
  \ last cigarette and started talking about the Argentinian magician and the Paraguayan\
  \ clown that I met, who were also writers; the strange talks that we had and the\
  \ secrets that we shared.  However, I had been speaking with myself as my brother\
  \ was too drunk to understand what I was saying.\nWhen we got home, I decided to\
  \ bring the world in to my room.  I sat down, turned on the computer, played music\
  \ and began to spin the globe. Once it stopped I stared longingly at Portugal. Then\
  \ the other hemisphere got activated in my head and this is what it said:\n \u201C\
  I took a trip around Latin America for more than two years because I wanted to become\
  \ a writer, after a year back at home, I realized that to be a writer I must travel\
  \ all my life\u201D.  I looked up and read the note I had on my wall: \n\u201CDreams\
  \ that are written on paper are one step ahead to becoming real\u201D.  \nInstantaneously,\
  \ as I touched the planet, my desire of writing took the spherical shape of my own\
  \ world. I was not expecting to find myself in front of my dream once again.\nThat\
  \ night before going to sleep I wrote down three words: \u201CThe Earth Globe\u201D\
  . The most genuine inspiration to make my dream of being a writer, a reality.\n\
