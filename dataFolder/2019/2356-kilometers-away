Text: "India, a bunch of 29  states and 7 union territories. All are completely different\
  \ from each other. It is a land where officially more than 15 languages are spoken\
  \ and unofficially more than 56. I belong to one such state named Maharashtra.\n\
  My city is Pune, located in the state of Maharashtra on the western coast of India.\
  \ Last year in December 2018, me and my wife visited a Gateway of the Noarth Eastern\
  \ States of India: Sikkim.\nI preferred to live in the capital city of Sikkim which\
  \ is Gangtok. Though its a capital city of a state, being a hilly area as well,\
  \ I was expecting that, it must be small city having population around 1-2 lakh\
  \ people with the availability of just bare necessities. Moreover it must be ths\
  \ same as rest of the India. But, I was completely shocked when I started discovering\
  \ the city.\nThis city is having population of around 10 lakhs. almost 2.5 hills\
  \ are covered with the households and hotels as well. It is equipped with all kinds\
  \ of multinational restaurants and brands to serve you and most importantly, it\
  \ is the cleanliest city i have ever came across till date. \nMe and my wife travelled\
  \ for almost 18 hours to reach to Gangtok. We travelled throgh each of transport\
  \ means available in India such as Train, Plane, Bus, Cab to reach to our destination.\
  \ It was my sencond time to went into the lap of himalayas and it was fascinating.\
  \ We have reached there around 1 am and were warmly welcomed by the chilling temperature\
  \ of approx 3 degrees. The beautiful scene from our room just vanished all the tiredness\
  \ we have gathered from previous day's travelling. \nWe quickly prepared ourselves\
  \ and took a cab for local sightseeing and started our day with a pleasant monestry\
  \ on our way to tashi view point. I havent experienced such a calmness in nature\
  \ in any of my previous journeys. Tashi view point is a place from which you can\
  \ get a comparatively clear view of Kangchenjunga Peak of eastern himalayas. It\
  \ was a breathtaking scene. I couldnt stop myself from taking pictures of it. I\
  \ was telling my betterhalf that it is calling me. Due to paucity of time we then\
  \ moved to Ganeshtok and then Hanuman tok. Though these places were crowded, we\
  \ have experienced some kind of a calmness in our hearts which cant be desctibed\
  \ in few words. \nThe most happenning thing in Gangtok we have visited in evening\
  \ and that is M G Marg. Its a walking zone with ample shopping options, tea lounges,\
  \ cafes and many more. It also has an impact of local food. I was not used to a\
  \ sunset at 5 pm, it was dense dark at 5 in the eve. we have spent hours on MG road\
  \ on our trip in addition to the sightseeing. I must mention a place named The Coffee\
  \ Shop on M G Marg.\nOn next day we visited Namchi and nearby places. Due to rains\
  \ in the night our complete journey was greeted by dense fog. Whenever, we could\
  \ have clear view, it was such an awesome experience for the eyes and a clean air\
  \ to breath. That day also ultimately ended on M G Marg. Next day was our visit\
  \ to Nathu la pass. It is border area of India and China. Due to heavy rains and\
  \ snowing on previous nights, we couldn't reach to Nathu La Pass. But, the local\
  \ cab driver took us till Tsomgo Lake. With only two day's snowing, it was fully\
  \ covered with a layer of ice. Thousands of tourists enjoying the snow. Although\
  \ there was a whitewash, I am very certain that it must be the most scenic place\
  \ in plush green view.\nThe most remarkable thing in my visit was the attitude of\
  \ locals towards the tourists. In addition to cleanliest city, locals follows all\
  \ the traffic rules. Complete city is no horn zone. Our Cab driver was a retired\
  \ government servant who was very informative and is still in touch through social\
  \ media.\nThough its my country land, it was unknown previously, but now, its within\
  \ my heart and soul."
