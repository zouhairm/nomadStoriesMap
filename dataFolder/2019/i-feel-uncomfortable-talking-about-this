Text: "\"I feel uncomfortable talking about this,\" she said.\n\nWe sat across from\
  \ each other in my Turkish friend\u2019s spacious Istanbul apartment, a bowl of\
  \ unshelled walnuts between us. With a nutcracker strategically clenched around\
  \ the embossed shell of one, I carefully squeezed to break the seal and remove the\
  \ nut as whole as possible.\n\nOur conversation had moved comfortably from one topic\
  \ to another \u2013 work, friends, family \u2013 and had landed on my Armenian background.\
  \ \n\nAs I showed her photos of my ancestors from Adana, she was visibly shocked.\
  \ \u201CWow. They\u2019re really attractive!\u201D she chuckled. \n\n\u201CI know!\u201D\
  \ I agreed. \u201CThey were really beautiful.\u201D\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t mean to\
  \ offend you,\u201D she started, \u201Cbut my grandfather (from a city near the\
  \ current Turkey-Armenia border) used to tell stories from his grandfather who would\
  \ say the Russians were nice and beautiful, but the Armenians were awful and ugly.\
  \ Armenians,\u201D she continued, \u201Chave a distinct look, but yours are actually\
  \ attractive. I just thought they were all unattractive.\u201D\n\nCrack. The seal\
  \ broke. I jiggled the shells apart.\n\n\u201CInteresting,\u201D I said, unoffended\
  \ but surprised by the racist subtext of my educated friend\u2019s comment, and\
  \ struggling to loosen the shells gripping the brain-shaped nut inside. \u201CI\
  \ think all the Armenians I know, including those in the States, are beautiful.\u201D\
  \n\nI wasn\u2019t offended, it was true, just struck by how often something similar\
  \ has been said by any one group about another. Or even how many times people have\
  \ called me ugly or beautiful, depending on any number of factors. \n\n\u201CWhat\
  \ do you think of the genocide? Do you think it was a genocide?\u201D she asked\
  \ me, questioning it while recalling a documentary she\u2019d recently heard of\
  \ in which Turks had accused Armenians of doing the same. \n\nHalf a walnut came\
  \ free. \n\nThe conversation had landed on that dreaded g-word.\n\nSurprised by\
  \ her discomfort and knowing this topic still holds all the complexity and potential\
  \ danger of a landmine matrix in Turkey, especially for a foreigner trying to gauge\
  \ all the particulars of a person \u2013 place of origin, religion or no, education,\
  \ political views, and so forth \u2013 I wondered how openly I should continue talking.\n\
  \nI struggled with the other half shell.\n\n\"I have a lot more to say about this,\
  \ more than I feel is appropriate right now,\u201D I said, listening to her young\
  \ daughter playing in the other room, unsure of how to have this conversation now.\
  \ How could I explain how being in Turkey felt like a multilevel identity crisis\
  \ for me? The way I grew up hearing stories about my Armenian people and the Turks\
  \ that harmed them. The way feeling affection for my very first Turkish students\
  \ felt liberating and healing, for me and for my deceased relatives whose traumatic\
  \ experiences ring like the reverberating clang of bells through multiple generations.\
  \ The way coming to Istanbul the first time felt like I had stumbled upon a family\
  \ reunion on every street. The way I love so many things about Islam, the religion\
  \ of those who captured and slaughtered my not-so-distant ancestors. The interest\
  \ I have in allowing the healing energy of clarity and forgiveness to enter in for\
  \ my living relatives and those whose DNA rattles around \u2013 sometimes lovingly,\
  \ sometimes annoyingly \u2013 inside my own. What my blood recognizes and yearns\
  \ to embrace even more, yet feels pained by the lack of welcome I feel. \n\n\u201C\
  I don't mean to make you uncomfortable in any way,\" I answered, \"but I appreciate\
  \ you telling me. What I find most interesting about any cultural trauma is how\
  \ people construct the story of what happened.\"\n\nThe stubborn middle membrane\
  \ fractured, and I worked to loosen the nut from the shell.\n\nWe continued talking,\
  \ carefully choosing our words as to avoid a potential conversation mine, me taking\
  \ a wide berth answering anything about the g-word, and her citing atrocities on\
  \ both sides, expressing discomfort, and essentially doing a conversational shrug,\
  \ as in, how can anyone know the truth? I was struck by the way our discussion smacked\
  \ of the same ongoing international debate between Turkey and the rest of the world.\
  \ \n\nSnap. A small piece of the nut broke off in shards, leaving the remainder\
  \ stuck inside."
