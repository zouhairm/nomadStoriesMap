Text: '''Why do you always hold your breath, when someone new hugs you'''', I never
  realized that this habit has became visible to my new Chinese friends, Mia asked
  me with a concerned face. I can''t tell them how much I hate hugs, and why. They
  won''t understand, we have different backgrounds and they still have mothers and
  fathers to hug them. The answer to her question, strangle my throat till it hurts,
  with the silence as thick as the sole of my second Dr Martens boots. I have met
  May people on my way to China, in those connecting flights and I don''t remember
  hugging any of them, not because they stink or sweaty or any other hygienic reason.
  I don''t like hugs because people tend to remember the warmth of your body, or you
  do. After mu father''s funeral, I made rules for myself and they included no hugging.

  The last hug I shared with my father was on that day of my first day to travel overseas,
  with no one to hold. My first week in China was horrible, and right on that moment
  when I called home to tell them how much I loved and missed them, my mom sobbed
  for 5 minutes trying to get the words to explain why she was crying, when she finally
  found them.

  She pronounced death and it''s okay in one sentence like she was trying to convince
  me that keeping a dead dog is a good idea. I hate hugs and love them but I just
  need to find the right hugger to help me, learn hugging and get over the mindset
  that when people hug me they might judge me.'
