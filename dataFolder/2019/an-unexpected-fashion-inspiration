Text: "Exhausted by the eventful day exploring Andalusia, I concluded the night by\
  \ laying in the patio beneath a dark night sky illuminated only by the moon and\
  \ the stars. The pleasant contrast between the hot summer atmosphere and the cool\
  \ terracotta tiles against my skin reminded me of my favorite dessert: a scoop of\
  \ ice cream on a warm cookie fresh out of the oven. As I embraced the comfortable\
  \ surface and looked for constellations above me, I wondered if the tiles of the\
  \ region served a practical purpose beyond style to manage the blazing heat. \n\n\
  I was hoping that this trip would be a catalyst for my travel companion to fall\
  \ madly in love with me over tapas and wine, but I unexpectedly became enamored\
  \ with Spanish tiles instead.\_\n\n \"Azulejos,\" as the locals call the tiles,\
  \ are found everywhere from churches to schools, from taverns to homes. Prior to\
  \ this vacation, I only noticed tiling in the Home Depot for bathroom renovations.\
  \ California architecture is historically influenced by Spain, but I never experienced\
  \ hand-painted tiles like this in my home state. Each swirling brushstroke was created\
  \ by an artisan hand rather than an inkjet printer. The seamless patterns on the\
  \ walls were full of character and perfectly imperfect. I was accustomed to utilizing\
  \ the precision of computerization by rendering patterns on Photoshop. I suddenly\
  \ missed the traditional paintbrush and realized that the last time I painted tiles\
  \ was at a birthday party in the third grade.\n\nAs a fashion designer whose wanderlust\
  \ has brought infinite opportunities, I firmly believe that inspiration should not\
  \ be limited to art museums and cultural clothing. I could envision an extravagant\
  \ azulejo-based Dolce & Gabbana dress at the legendary Galeries Lafayette luxury\
  \ department store in Paris. I spent my morning admiring colorful alcoves depicting\
  \ periodic fashion statements of various Spanish provinces at the Plaza de Espa\xF1\
  a in Seville. These detailed illustrations of apparel are examples of straightforward\
  \ and standard sources of inspiration. However, my preferred methods of research\
  \ involve discovering and interpreting innovative concepts through my abstract observations.\
  \ \n\nThe normal tourist only sees what is before their eyes, but my rose-tinted\
  \ glasses transform my surroundings into garment designs. When gazing with a squinted\
  \ eye at a building, I see unconventional silhouettes of jackets and coats within\
  \ the macro shapes of architectural designs. Pictorial mosaics alongside windows\
  \ and planters become a part of a greater mosaic in my field of vision and are translated\
  \ into avant-garde fashion shapes by my imagination. When studying tiling up close,\
  \ I discover textile designs for potential knit fabrics. Complex sceneries could\
  \ be elaborate jacquards. Geometric dual-tone designs could be gorgeous intarsias.\
  \ \n\nThe tiles of Spain have lived a weathered life. Many are chipped, cracked\
  \ or have fallen off completely. The vibrant hues faded throughout the years, but\
  \ I could imagine the freshly-glazed colors that existed decades or even centuries\
  \ ago. The remaining pigments of cerulean blue, sage green and burnt orange are\
  \ still rich and flamboyant. I could see the colors as a modern palette for evening\
  \ gowns on the red carpet.\n\nThe Iberian peninsula was a Muslim territory in medieval\
  \ times and is therefore heavily influenced by the Middle East. I was captivated\
  \ by the merging of two distinct cultures while visiting the Mezquita of Cordoba,\
  \ a Catholic Cathedral converted from an Islamic Mosque. Muslim artists created\
  \ an unmistakable style by designing intricate tessellations that obeyed the creative\
  \ rules of their religion. The marriage of the Spanish and Arabic ideas birthed\
  \ a unique offspring, like chinoiserie, a popular aesthetic trend of the 1800s in\
  \ which the French imitated Chinese motifs discovered on the Silk Road. \L\n\nAs\
  \ I continued to reflect on azulejos and mosaics while laying on my side, the smooth\
  \ terracotta against my cheek was like the\_cold side of a pillow that never needed\
  \ to be flipped over. I was endlessly admiring Spanish tiles throughout my trip,\
  \ even as I relaxed under the stars during the final moments of my night. As I pondered\
  \ how I could incorporate the beauty of Andalusia into my developing designs upon\
  \ my return to the studio, I peacefully fell asleep outdoors on the tiled floor\
  \ and dreamed of infinite design possibilities."
