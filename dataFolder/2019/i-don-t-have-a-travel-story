Text: 'Traveling the world. Most people only dream about such a thing. I once dreamed
  it. While I was dreaming it, I started to look around at why most people did not
  bring this dream to fruition.


  My first thought was that it was a lack of money that held people back. As Africa,
  suposedly, we''re in the top 10% of the world''s poorest people. So that can''t
  be it. Then I started noticing people who were 40 and 50 years old sitting behind
  a computer in their cubicles. These are the people who said they were going to travel
  the world when they were younger. They never did.


  Perhaps there''s always an excuse. "I have to finish college." "I just got a new
  job." "I''ve got a new girl friend." "I just got married." "I just had a kid." "I''m
  too old for this stuff." All are perfectly good excuses not to have the time of
  your life by traveling around the world.


  But I suddenly realized I was in a position in my life where I had absolutely no
  excuse. I just finished college. I had no boyfriend, no kids, no house. I had a
  good-paying job, but that was it.


  Then it hit me. If I don''t travel around the world now, I never will.


  Needless to say, that thought scared me into where I am right now. If you''d like
  the whole story of how me an William ended up becoming travel companions, check
  out our story.


  We''re merely days away from embarking on an incredible journey that will no doubt
  change our lives forever.'
