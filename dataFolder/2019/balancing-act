Text: "Por laughed as I stumbled backwards and careened into the water, painfully\
  \ highlighting the fact that boats were not my thing. Water, in general, was not\
  \ my thing and the islands of Thailand were probably not the best place to begin\
  \ an aquatic lifestyle. Still, it could be worse. The clear water welcomed me like\
  \ a familiar friend; this wasn\u2019t the first overboard incident I\u2019ve had\
  \ today. The colorful schools of fish surrounded me, tickling my skin, urging me\
  \ to just give in and become one of them already; I\u2019ve fallen into the water\
  \ enough times that they now recognized me.\n\nI could hear the mirth in his voice,\
  \ piercing through the water over my head, \u201CYou need help?\u201D Yes Por, I\
  \ need help. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing here, on the other side of the\
  \ world. This is my unknown. I\u2019m floating here, 14 timezones away from the\
  \ only life I knew. This trip was an experiment, pushing my boundaries of comfort.\
  \ It was a practice in letting go and taking chances. But Por didn\u2019t know how\
  \ to help me with any of that. Only fishing, only boats.\n\nI struggled into the\
  \ vessel as my guide helped me onboard, a dance we had rehearsed many times that\
  \ day. In moments, we were off again. Perhaps we\u2019d try a calmer bay, as if\
  \ that would help me balance. His little wooden boat cut through the crystal blue\
  \ waters off the coast of Koh Phi Phi with ease, and I barely felt seasick. It could\u2019\
  ve also been the Dramamine I was popping like vitamins. Like I said, water was not\
  \ my thing. I fidgeted with my turquoise bracelet to keep my mind off my stomach.\n\
  \nI received the bracelet from an old Thai woman in the market three days ago in\
  \ Chiang Mai. She pointed to me as if she saw a ghost, though it was probably just\
  \ my lack of sleep, stress and jetlag. \u201CYou take this,\u201D she pressed the\
  \ bracelet into my palm. The stones were supposed to bring luck, prosperity and\
  \ balance. I tried not to think about the irony in that as I ran my fingers over\
  \ them, trying not to fall again, focusing on the dramatic Thai coastline. \n\n\
  Enormous, jagged rocks like skyscrapers rose from the azure waters around us. Around\
  \ their corners we\u2019d find forgotten beaches with powdery white sand. The sight\
  \ was achingly beautiful. Whenever Por would anchor in a beach or bay, he\u2019\
  d feed the fishes as I leapt (or more accurately, fell) into the water, to photograph\
  \ the fish and forget the hectic life I had back in the States. The never-ending\
  \ emails, the 8am meetings, the mansplaining and missed lunches. The 13-hour days,\
  \ the working on the weekends. Yes, hopefully the bracelet would bring me the balance\
  \ I desperately needed. \n\nThe final beach Por brought me to was a special one.\
  \ It didn\u2019t have a name and there was not a soul around. It was perfect. On\
  \ the way into the bay we sailed past a set of rickety shacks perched on stilts\
  \ in the water. His home. The houses were peeling, their colors fading. I surmised\
  \ that long ago they stood tall in shades of blue, orange and green. His family\
  \ emerged shyly to wave at us as we passed. Por said the fish here used to be abundant,\
  \ but not so much anymore. The seasons have been changing and he has been adjusting.\
  \ He works hard to provide for his family but always makes time to teach them how\
  \ to fish when he returns. And when there are no more fish, he will teach them to\
  \ work and to play. Balance. Like his house on stilts above the water, Por\u2019\
  s life has been balance. He didn\u2019t need a bracelet for that.\n\nPor dropped\
  \ me off at my hotel in the evening. With sunburnt hands, I said goodbye and thanked\
  \ him. I told him I would be back to visit, and I meant it. He chuckled again. \u201C\
  Next time, you learn to stay in the boat!\u201D\n\nI still wear the bracelet at\
  \ my new job. Though it hasn\u2019t helped much with boats, I\u2019m slowly finding\
  \ my balance every day."
