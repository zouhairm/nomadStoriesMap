Text: "There were a lot of things I didn't expect to find in Amsterdam. Some less\
  \ pleasant than others - 'coffee shops' and sports bars for example. I didn't cherish\
  \ finding these because they bought me back to reality. The rest of Amsterdam was\
  \ a dream to me. I have been lucky to visit a bit of Europe in the last year. But\
  \ I have never really felt like I have travelled or seen the world until I went\
  \ to Amsterdam alone. There is something in traveling alone that means once you\
  \ give yourself over to a new place, you cannot help but be happy. \n\nThere is\
  \ an art to traveling alone. It means going off social media. It means trying local\
  \ food, even if there is a part of you that begs not to (not that I can really judge\
  \ as I did skip herring). It means adventuring, sometimes in the dark, with the\
  \ possibility that something might go horribly wrong. It is something that a lot\
  \ of people have no desire for, if not open fear of. It is also something that a\
  \ lot of people want so terribly hard it might break their hearts, even if they\
  \ fear it, even if they struggle to afford it. I am not advocating that you jump\
  \ on a plane without packing anything but a headful of adventurous dreamy thoughts,\
  \ but solo travel to that place that your gut tells you to need to experience is\
  \ something that everyone should do in their lifetime. I'll bet that even in reading\
  \ that, you thought of it. \n\nAmsterdam was that place for me. I booked the trip\
  \ with birthday money that had been in savings for over a year, sitting at home\
  \ alone, on a whim, because I needed something to look forward to. I was very prepared\
  \ beforehand as I researched government travel advice and all manner of rules and\
  \ logistics. There was also the more fun research, founded in intense daydreaming.\
  \ Constant googling of things to do, what to see, what to eat. I planned out each\
  \ meal in my head to ensure that I could try test as many '10 best foods to eat\
  \ in Amsterdam' as possible.\n\nI saw beautiful things, yes. From Rembrandt's the\
  \ Night Watchmen, Van Gogh paintings, tiny houses made of delftware, tulips arranged\
  \ into a Dutch flag. But in an age of Instagram and constant Googling (I really\
  \ do like to be prepared), I expected to find them. I even knew exactly what the\
  \ menu looked like at De Viar Pilaren and how much my poffertjies would be. The\
  \ trip itself wasn't a wild adventure to the unknown, so what could I have found\
  \ that I didn't expect to? I found myself.  I didn't expect to, because I didn't\
  \ know I was lost.\n\nThe things I didn't expect to find in Amsterdam are the intangible.\
  \ Freedom, safety, joy and little bit of peace. Amsterdam, with all its tulips and\
  \ bicycles and canals, found me when I needed it. It is very difficult to describe\
  \ what I did because what I remember most vividly is how I felt. I remember people\
  \ watching in Foodhallen. I remember drinking a large beer and gleefully cycling\
  \ home because I could and in my little bubble of constantly moving cyclists, I\
  \ was safe. I remember coasting down the street to my hotel, feet flung out to the\
  \ sides like a kid. I remember riding down main streets, wondering about the lives\
  \ of people just getting to the cafes just as the sky hit sunset purple, and wanting\
  \ desperately to write about their lives.\n\nReally, what I didn't expect to find\
  \ were the things I felt. After an intense four-day love affair, Amsterdam has left\
  \ me with a very specific dream. That of one day walking out on to my own tiny balcony,\
  \ drinking a small delftware cup of coffee that my stroopwaffel has been warming\
  \ on, gazing down the canal, as cyclists ride by on a mild Sunday. And a very strong\
  \ desire to get a black road bike, complete with a wicker basket for the tulips\
  \ that I cannot help but buy, to take me back even just for a second."
