Text: Delhi, a city with extremely rich history and culture has seen everything, from
  bloodshed to celebrations, empires to spices, food to colors. My travel story is
  spread across a day in Delhi where I started the journey with 4 friends and walked
  the road for over 7 kms to reach a famous monument of India called India gate. The
  recent peace crisis in India and Pakistan was a trigger for us and made me feel
  too many things the moment I saw my country's flag waving in the sky. After the
  much needed patriotism I went to old Delhi (Purani dilli). Purani Dilli is famous
  for it's age hold food corners and I explored 2 food corners which have existed
  for more than 100 years now. The first one was a sweet corner where 'Jalebi', a
  famous form of Indian sweet was served from the year 1880 and the second one was
  a corner was eating spicy Indian snacks, it was 50 years old. I interacted with
  the snack store owners and asked them about the reason they didn't expand or modify
  their street stores after so many years, their reasoning made my day! They wanted
  to keep their traditions alive and not let go of their ancestral heritage. Their
  food's speciality lied in the blessings of their ancestors and they never wanted
  to let go of it. That's what gave life to the hidden treasures of purani dilli and
  all the vibes this place has.
