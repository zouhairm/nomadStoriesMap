Text: "Every time I go on trip, even if it is to a place I have been plenty of times\
  \ before, I try to discover new things about the site I am visiting. It could be\
  \ anything really, from a new coffee shop to a restaurant I have not gone yet, a\
  \ thrifty shop or a museum.\nFor example, on my last travel I went with my family\
  \ to Cabo Frio \u2013 a popular seaside city in my state. I have been there a thousand\
  \ times in the past and I explored the region quite a lot, however, as I said, there\
  \ is always something new to be find! \nOne night I came upon this amazing restaurant,\
  \ with the best seafood I have ever tasted. No kidding. The diner is located close\
  \ to a pier, in a street full of others restaurants and bars. The place is highly\
  \ visited by the locals, which was to be expected for them serving the fish that\
  \ were fished in that very same day. So besides being fresh, the food is tender,\
  \ well seasoned and has the warmth of a homemade dish.\nAside from the food, the\
  \ view from the restaurant is breath taking. The sky, the sea and the boats close\
  \ to the pier creates an astonishing landscape. I kept coming back there during\
  \ the trip just to appreciate such delicate scenery and to taste that delicious\
  \ food. If I had only gone to the places I already new, I would never find this\
  \ restaurant. \nThere is always something new waiting to be discovered, even in\
  \ your hometown. Stores come and go. Nothings lasts forever, it is always changing.\
  \ There are concerts, expositions and so many other cultural events \u2013 such\
  \ as fairs and theater performances. Just go! Explore! Seize the day and the moment.\
  \ Grab the opportunity that is standing in front of you and go somewhere. You never\
  \ know the marvelous things you may find out."
