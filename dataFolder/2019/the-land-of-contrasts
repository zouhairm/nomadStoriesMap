Text: "Every challenge is a dream. From time to time I am dreaming of fascinating\
  \ and unknown places without any logical explanation. In this inexplicable manner\
  \ on September 2017, I went to Kyrgyzstan for the first time with some friends.\
  \ Our first steps in the country included a quick nap, traditional breakfast, local\
  \ beer and sightseeing around the capital. The city bazaar of Bishkek seemed to\
  \ be a hybrid of eastern European markets with the color and aroma of the Orient.\n\
  On the next day we continued according to the plan to the plateau Jalpak Tash. We\
  \ had to cross the country from the north to the south part via the passage through\
  \ the Tian Shan mountains called T\xF6\xF6 Ashuu. The passage was very picturesque\
  \ and at the same time filled me with adrenaline. The Traffic rules as we know them,\
  \ do not exist on this road. Cars, trucks, horses and sheep were running on it and\
  \ overtaking each other on the curves, most often on the narrowest segments of the\
  \ \u201Chighway\u201D.\nInspired by the yurt life, one of my friends and I tried\
  \ koumiss. You must be strong to appreciate koumiss properly. The taste is very\
  \ sour and salty, and has the flavor of an old goat. The day went by, and we were\
  \ on the shores of the largest dam in the country, Toktogul. \nOn the next day we\
  \ continued through the city Uzgen, marked by Muslim spirit and culture. Finally,\
  \ we reached our first destination. The plateau Jalpak Tash is covered with a thick\
  \ layer of loess soil, usually on top of gypsum and, rarely, limestone. The gypsum\
  \ there is softer than the limestone and the cave formation is faster than at the\
  \ normal karst areas. The holes we had initially spotted were not actual caves.\
  \ Nevertheless, we enjoyed the wild horses which were galloping and making new paths\
  \ across the plateau, the numerous herds of sheep and the vastness of this nature.\
  \  \nThe next day started on one hand with the worst off-road experience and, on\
  \ the other, the most colorful impressions of my life. It was terrible because of\
  \ the dust, but colorful because I was in this incredibly charming place with our\
  \ hospitable Kyrgyz guides. After 100 km we were in the village of Jetim-doboo.\
  \ Then we stopped in front of a wagon. In fact, it was the village shop, where one\
  \ of our guides pleasantly surprised me with cold beer. We continued and finally\
  \ we were in front of our first cave. Kara-Unkur is a monochannel, water cave. The\
  \ group was happy and satisfied with our caving and went back to the camp. Everybody\
  \ unloaded the equipment from the car and we were ready for dinner. In that moment\
  \ I stood with my favorite guide, and with our beers we enjoyed the reddish-colored\
  \ sunset over the plateau. A stolen second which makes you feel free, forget about\
  \ your past and not think about your future.\nWe spent the following day in Osh,\
  \ the second biggest town in Kyrgyzstan \u2013 famous for being the city of weddings,\
  \ the holy mountain Sulaiman-Too, and the biggest statue of Lenin which marks the\
  \ city center. In the afternoon of the next day we arrived in the second target\
  \ area \u2013 the holy for the Kyrgyz Muslims waterfall Abshir-Ata. Our goal was\
  \ to check the waterfall entrance for any cave presence. \nOur last point was the\
  \ mountain range Tuyu-Muyun. According to the plan we had to explore the Dangi canyon.\
  \ The river Aravan-Sai curved like a snake through the canyon and eagles soared\
  \ over that spectacular place.\nAs we know nothing lasts forever and we prepared\
  \ for our departure. Unexpectedly we were back on the biggest Kyrgyz dam. The place\
  \ where we spent the night was a Soviet campsite with old plywood bungalows where\
  \ time was frozen. \nAgain, our guide skillfully maneuvered through the chaos of\
  \ sheep, cars and trucks back to Bishkek. Again, everything was the same, but also\
  \ different. For a split second I realized that I am leaving a part of my soul forever\
  \ to soar with the eagles under Tuyu-Muyun, gallop with the wind in T\xF6\xF6 Ashuu\
  \ and admire the reddish sunset over Jalpak Tash."
