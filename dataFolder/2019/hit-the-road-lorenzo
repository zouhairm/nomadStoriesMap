Text: "I should have never started my journey. I should have never began to travel.\
  \ Better never even thinking about travelling. I should have stayed at home, with\
  \ my family, my friends and the warmth of my house.\nUnfortunately, I chose to go\
  \ to Cuba and dive into a completely different culture. The locals kept asking me\
  \ for money, which money could I gave them? I was myself on a very low-budget trip\u2026\
  \nThen, in Mexico, people where rude and it was really dangerous due to the well\
  \ known corruption problems they have, as it was in Belize, and Honduras. How could\
  \ I have travelled with all those perils surrounding me? Was I mad staying there\
  \ for over three months?\nAll those places where harsh and uncomfortable, I should\
  \ have stayed home. \nThe only spark that kept me on the road was maybe meeting\
  \ the most amazing people of my life, making lifelong friendships and getting to\
  \ know the woman I love.\nI explored Mayan temples and caves, I learned the local\
  \ culture and that Mayan people are not an extinguished civilization, but they are\
  \ still living in Central America! I learned how to share an hotel room with strangers\
  \ and a tiny seat on a old yellow school bus in Guatemala, driving through winding\
  \ and narrow mountain roads. \nI learned that some cities take a special place in\
  \ your heart and you will never forget them. \nI learned how to fish from a surfboard\
  \ in Puerto Escondido, that life is not only about money and you can survive with\
  \ very little effort if you are with outstanding positive people! \nI learned that\
  \ is easy to organise a bad ass road trip around Nevada, Utah and Arizona, camping\
  \ in the desert with strangers just met on Couchsurfing! And that is amazing to\
  \ spend a week in a huge villa in Santa Cruz, hosted by cool locals met at the beach!\n\
  All this things happened to me because I had a thousand reasons to stay at home\
  \ but only one to step out of my comfort zone and start truly to feel alive, living\
  \ the day and realise myself as a human being. Unfortunately, or fortunately\u2026\
  \ I chose that one."
