Text: "The lights were blinding, the hall full of people, thousands of eyes directed\
  \ to the stage. Her name was called. The tension was so high she couldn\u2019t hear\
  \ anything. In no time, the piece of paper was in her hands. She only felt nervous\
  \ though, nothing else. Where was the so long waited for crazy excitement about\
  \ the perspective of a new life? She could not understand. \nIt was July 27th 2017.\
  \ She had been waiting for this day for 5 years, and it finally came. It was a cloudy\
  \ and windy day, definitely not what she expected on a summer day. A bit chilly\
  \ outside, something she became used to after so many years living in bohemian Brighton,\
  \ England. \nHer two best friends were there, they came over all the way from Italy\
  \ to assist to this special day. Her mum and her partner flew in too. She was extremely\
  \ excited, although not every member of her family was there, to celebrate the efforts\
  \ and sacrifices made. Her dad had said he would come, but didn\u2019t. A last minute\
  \ lie tasted bitter in her mouth. Little that she knew, the moment she thought would\
  \ give her freedom and the chance to be independent, was going to be much different\
  \ than what she had imagined.\nAt the dinner table that night, all eyes were on\
  \ the newly graduate. Everyone looked at her and was waiting to hear great news.\
  \ She felt kind of awkward and didn\u2019t like to be under pressure. She never\
  \ did, it made her uncomfortable to receive so many compliments. Everyone was fantasising\
  \ about her possibilities, the world was hers to conquest... but she could not talk\
  \ about it. Until her brave friend finally asked the dreadful question: \u201CSo...\
  \ what are your plans now? What do you want to do?\u201D To which she nervously\
  \ replied: \u201CI\u2019m going to save money and move to Mexico next year\u201D\
  . Everyone was shocked. She continued: \u201CI discovered I\u2019m not cut for this\
  \ career. Although I could learn the trade, I don\u2019t think being an engineer\
  \ will satisfy me. Therefore I\u2019m engineering my way out of engineering\u201D\
  \ she said almost giggling \u201CI need a drastic change\u201D.\nThe room suddenly\
  \ quietened. Tension was in the air, as everyone thought she was making a mistake.\n\
  Although the mixed feelings and the brainstorming opinions, the decision was made.\n\
  6th April 2018, 6:24 am. She was by herself at Gatwick Airport impatiently waiting\
  \ to go overseas.\nThe airport is such a charming place. It means you are going\
  \ somewhere, new or old. You might want to see someone special you haven\u2019t\
  \ seen in a long time, you might want to start over. M\xE9xico was her chance to\
  \ do so: bye bye fish & chips and umbrellas, bienvenidos tacos y sombreros.\nThe\
  \ new adventure began. It didn\u2019t take her long to get into the lifestyle, that\
  \ she could do well. She made new friends, and submerged herself into the Mexican\
  \ culture. \nNothing could have made her happier than the idea of visiting new places.\
  \ \nMexican people made her feel welcome, their hospitality surprised her. Her good\
  \ friend Osiris took her to beautiful beaches, her favourite was Punta Negra. The\
  \ beautiful black rocks, big waves, mangoes, shrimps on sticks, and tranquility.\
  \ Coconuts are a must here. \nThis new experience was a trial and it worked! She\
  \ could confirm she preferred this type of lifestyle, but there was still something\
  \ missing, she was not fully happy yet. She was still into the old way of thinking,\
  \ habits, behaviours.\nAnd one day she finally realised. She was at the beach. It\
  \ was peaceful, the wind through the hair, sands between the toes, the sound of\
  \ the waves in the background, nature at its best. It came to her as an intuition.\
  \ She finally understood she did all wrong: at home she created her problems, in\
  \ England she became aware of them, and now it was time to defeat them. The journey\
  \ can now begin. \nAugust 13th, 2019: To be written"
