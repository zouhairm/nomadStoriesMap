Text: "There\u2019s a Sanskrit phrase that my father taught me when I was just a little\
  \ girl. \u201CVasudhaiva Kutumbakam\u201D \u2013 that roughly translates to: the\
  \ whole world is one single family. As a stubborn and precocious 11-year-old, the\
  \ peculiar words meant little to me. Despite this, they continued to echo frequently\
  \ in my head. In the bus on the way to school, while doing my homework, while brushing\
  \ my teeth. I\u2019d repeat the phrase \u2013 savouring the sounds as they rolled\
  \ off my tongue, amused at the strange ways it made my mouth contort. Those two\
  \ words that I never quite understood, never left me.\n\nFast forward nine years\
  \ later, and I was sitting at my desk, rushing through an assignment, when I chanced\
  \ upon an email from a local NGO I was involved with seeking ambassadors for a development\
  \ volunteer trip to a village in Kalimpong, India. So, one interview, several meetings,\
  \ twelve new friends and far too many emails later I found myself sitting on a plane\
  \ headed to Delhi. We set lofty goals for our trip and buzzwords like \u201Cempowerment\u201D\
  , \u201Crole models\u201D and \u201Cleaders\u201D were frequently thrown around\
  \ at meetings. We spent a fair amount of energy and time prepping for our trip.\
  \ Dance practices, language classes, research, workshops, first aid courses \u2014\
  \ we did it all. The second we stepped foot in Kalimpong though, that was all out\
  \ the door.\n\nWe were ready to tackle all the challenges that might arise, but\
  \ nothing had quite prepared us for the outpouring of love and hospitality we were\
  \ about to experience. Wherever we went, we were welcomed with flowers, garlands,\
  \ songs and dances. Small, dirt-caked hands would tug at my jeans and lead me places\
  \ \u2013 to see a new bathroom that had been set up with money our organization\
  \ donated, or to show me a new soccer ball they had been gifted by our volunteers.\
  \ Their constant overflowing gratitude, awe and kinship both embarrassed and humbled\
  \ me. What felt like so little for us, meant so much to them. It is amazing what\
  \ a bit of perspective can do to you. My exotic voluntourism trip came to an abrupt\
  \ and grinding halt. The acute realization of the immense and profound impact our\
  \ visit and the little money we had donated had on that community, was, in equal\
  \ parts sobering and heartbreaking. \n\nWhat we saw was a village that now had access\
  \ to water, a renovated school, clean toilets, and starry-eyed children with big\
  \ dreams. The people of Kalimpong and community leaders that we grew to know during\
  \ our time there, shone with humanity like I had never had the privilege of witness.\
  \ Their family spirit, sense of wonderment, inspiring, continual and unaffected\
  \ joy was a shocking reminder of all that we had lost. What was most overwhelming\
  \ was not the state of poverty (many children barely got to eat a meal a day) it\
  \ was the courage and happiness in the face of such strife. I went to Kalimpong\
  \ with the na\xEFve and egotistical view that I was going to help and touch the\
  \ lives of the people living there. Instead, they did all that to me. In reality,\
  \ they changed my life more than I could have ever hoped to change theirs.\n\nThe\
  \ people of Kalimpong embodied a spirit of community that we can only dream to achieve.\
  \ But we must. And we will. They made me realise that the best thing I could do\
  \ was to pass it on \u2013 to travel, to learn, to connect, to hope and then to\
  \ spread that message of love far and wide. Most importantly perhaps, they reminded\
  \ me that helping others isn\u2019t our choice, it\u2019s our duty. \n\n\nIt\u2019\
  s true that my father once taught me a Sanskrit phrase, but what my 11-year-old\
  \ brain couldn\u2019t ever comprehend, I understood at 21 in a small village in\
  \ Kalimpong, India; Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam \u2013 the whole world is one single family."
