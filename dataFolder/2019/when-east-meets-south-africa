Text: "When East Meets South Africa: A Transformational Memoir of a Chinese Millennial\
  \ is a meandering, serendipitous journey of exploring about my connection with the\
  \ world through going to a country with lower than 2.5% Asian population in South\
  \ Africa. In 2017, as a second-year master\u2019s student, I joined the summer study\
  \ abroad program from New York University Steinhardt to study Educational and Social\
  \ Reform of South Africa for one month. It starts from why I first choose to go\
  \ to South Africa, how I get lost on the first day, be helped many times by strangers,\
  \ to a song that brings me to understand the intellectual revolutions of South African\
  \ youth and how I encounter a near-death experience\u2014attacked by a giraffe\u2014\
  at the end of the trip. The memoir conveys the tears and joy while stumbling across\
  \ all the adventures of a journey that frightened, strengthened, and ultimately,\
  \ enlightened me. This inspiring book is for all the adventurers, dreamers, and\
  \ anyone who needs a pleasant diversion in short bite-sized chunks loaded with travel\
  \ wisdom. \n\nPrior to my visit to South Africa, I barely knew anything about the\
  \ country; I did not know about the history of Apartheid - that there were white\
  \ people living in South Africa, that Afrikaners were whites, and I knew nothing\
  \ about Nelson Mandala asides from the fact that he was a South African President.\
  \ I was made to understand that most of the people are blind to Africa and afraid\
  \ to travel because of the skewed perceptions generated by mainstream media. Africa\
  \ was portrayed as a continent that is nothing more than poverty-stricken, war affected\
  \ and also a place where pandemonium prevails. However, that is the only thing that\
  \ stereotypes do, and they act on sheer ignorance. Life is too short to doubt your\
  \ instincts, especially if it is real enough to be called your passion. I realized\
  \ that I just wanted the experience, and when my instincts told me to go, I realized\
  \ it was not just my instinct speaking to me, it was my soul giving me an opportunity\
  \ to view the world differently.\n\nBarely knowing anything about this country and\
  \ what my physical presence was reflecting on a new culture, I took this opportunity\
  \ to explore the social and educational reform of South Africa since Apartheid left\
  \ 23 years ago as well as my identity through an African lens. A month seems short,\
  \ but the spikes of novelty, the changes in my surroundings, and all the little\
  \ details I normally wouldn\u2019t have paid attention to, things like hearing the\
  \ sound of walking through the dry grass, had elongated my sense of time. Over the\
  \ course of my travel, besides reading the history of South Africa\u2014mostly about\
  \ Social Reform of Pre and Post-Apartheid, I also took an unconventional way to\
  \ learn about the country\u2014by talking to the locals. Traveling and learning\
  \ about other cultures and meeting people from unfamiliar places is not only the\
  \ best way to learn about our own culture, but also about ourselves, and to see\
  \ a broader picture.\n \nThe book is one part of a travel guide, one part of a memoir,\
  \ and one part of the rural school field visit. The first part includes essential\
  \ facts and information about South Africa that every traveler needs to know (e.g.,\
  \ useful websites, things must bring; medical requirements). The second part is\
  \ about personal travel memoir. Each chapter is a stand-alone story illuminating\
  \ the lessons I have learned from observation of an interaction, a statement from\
  \ a conversation, and my self-reflection during nights.  \n\nThe purpose of this\
  \ book is to spread the unexpected kindness I encountered from many strangers along\
  \ the way. I also want to give voice to ordinary people who needed to be heard,\
  \ the lessons I have learned along the way, and finally to show readers the South\
  \ African children with the best smiles in the world. My ultimate goal is to use\
  \ my most genuine words and unfiltered photographs to bring the audiences to experience\
  \ being a fish out of water in Sub-Saharan Africa."
