Text: "I am a psychologist by vocation and writer for passion or evasion. I am always\
  \ afraid to call myself a '' writer '' because I am humble and I would just like\
  \ to use words well. Those words that are so trained to listen, sometimes get stuck\
  \ in the sheet. Join the journey to writing, yes, but what kind of trip? The journey\
  \ of real life I would say. I never thought of traveling only for tourism, I want\
  \ to travel to live my story, listen to other stories and write one myself, perhaps\
  \ in poetry. I have been catapulted to Ireland for 4 months now. I could write greener\
  \ greenery, intertwined trees, elven landscapes, about the end of the world, Deer,\
  \ lakes, legends, trunks, waterfalls, monasteries and even magical trees. Romance\
  \ here that does not have days counted.\n But I will not do it. This Ireland that\
  \ I'm living in and that has been living in me for a while, is Ireland with a hard\
  \ accent, but sung. And Ireland where I spend my time with the homeless. They always\
  \ prepare tea to avoid drinking. I like watching them in their routines. It is Ireland\
  \ where communication seemed to have stopped and then restored. I decided that silence\
  \ should not belong to me anymore. For the first time I lived and accepted this\
  \ communicative limit, hoping it would pass soon. I wanted to understand their stories,\
  \ I wanted to know how to respond. And then Bum, this gray sky and this constant\
  \ rain, the wind in the face. That intimate poetry that always brings me back to\
  \ myself and forces me to never get lost. I'm not lost. I found myself traveling\
  \ back to Portugal for a week that I can only describe with a poem.\nAn almost human\
  \ caress, but deeper.\nThose eroded rocks remind you why you are in the world\n\
  Non-random layers are perfect\n A pure symmetry that keeps you company\nYou are\
  \ above the blue world\nYou're on a restless carpet\nYou also know the mirrors better\
  \ now \nYou found yourself inside and you felt good. \nIt can not be forgotten\n\
  A homemade toast with that bread\nIn a bar in a corner of land under that shed\n\
  goodness grabs \nUnexpected Sunday morning\nWith that genuine desire to enjoy the\
  \ little things\nAnd a lot of generous laughter.\nBetween spiral arches, towers\
  \ and crosses\nWe will make the most daring spectacles\nFinished in robust spaces\n\
  And that gentleman so timid and ephemeral \nHow much poetry in a glass of free wine\n\
  \ In any restaurant you can meet\nOld ladies intent on singing\nAnd luck belongs\
  \ to you \nThe thread of these games holds you back \nThe bright colors \nThe shivers\
  \ under the skin\nThey are the only tracks to touch the stars.\nEven the smell can\
  \ be special. At a certain point you do not feel it anymore.\nIn the end happiness\
  \ is a 'Pastel de nata' at a yellow tram\u2019s stop on a sunny day. \nAnd then\
  \ what is here in Ireland and inside of me? I had bought shoes with claqueries two\
  \ years ago. Perhaps it was all predestined. At that Irish dance hour a week I feel\
  \ free to slam my feet and finally create music with my body. At some point the\
  \ feet go by themselves and I do not control them anymore. I wrote a poem for this\
  \ too.\nHere's what I want to be. Telling stories of others or places with mine\
  \ inside. An interweaving of stories and poems. One me and one of them. I want to\
  \ feel things inside of me before giving them back to you.\nAnd now, something special\
  \ from Ireland:\nPublic house\nThat day in 1777,\nI closed my eyes and found them\
  \ all singing.\nThe high note tickled me\nI was thrilled to vibrate the low note\n\
  The sad melody entered me.\nSo many forgotten items\nMany untidy notes\nTogether\
  \ they mumbled.\nLords who made history,\nLadies with a perfume of glory.\nAn unconventional\
  \ wet cheer.\nScattered and alert,\nFound and fragile.\nI have now the heart of\
  \ another era."
