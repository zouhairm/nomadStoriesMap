Text: "I never thought my Bollywood dance classes in Chicago, would come in handy\
  \ on my trip to Iran, but that was due to a lack of imagination on my part. As it\
  \ turned out, these classes would provide the skills I needed to turn a rest stop\
  \ into an unforgettable and enchanting adventure. Iran is full of the magic of surprise,\
  \ you just have to be lucky enough to find it and on this particular trip, I was.\n\
  \tOn an unbearably hot and humid early July morning, while visiting Iran, my cousin\
  \ Hassan, brother Amir, and I decide to escape the oppressive heat of Tehran and\
  \ head for the fresh air of Taleghan, a small town that rests in the fading foothills\
  \ of the Alborz Mountains, between Tehran and the Caspian Sea. We creep along the\
  \ increasingly steep, winding roads, as we leave the city behind, dust from the\
  \ road billowing out behind us, obscuring Tehran\u2019s fading skyline and lending\
  \ the drive a dreamlike quality. The morning fades quickly, along with Hassan and\
  \ Amir\u2019s lively chatter, as hunger sets in and the car fills with the whispered\
  \ symphony of our collective stomach rumblings. \u201CRight on time.\u201D Hassan\
  \ sighs, patting his stomach. \u201CBia, bokhorim. Come, let\u2019s eat.\u201D \
  \   \n\t Sure enough, as the road crests, a restaurant comes into view. It looks\
  \ closed, with no signs of activity, but Hassan is not deterred and runs off in\
  \ search of the owner. He quickly reappears, owner in tow, and we\u2019re ushered\
  \ inside. I feel like I\u2019m entering The Secret Garden. I step gingerly onto\
  \ a stone walkway, covered in old moss and shrouded at points by overgrown vegetation.\
  \ A thick canopy of trees overhead nearly blocks out the midday sun but random splashes\
  \ of sunlight fight their way through and dot the labyrinthine walkway with a shimmering\
  \ essence. Each branch of the weaving walkway dead-ends at a short, raised, wooden\
  \ platform, simply adorned with a low-lying table in the center, surrounded by large,\
  \ lounging pillows. We recline on the pillows while we wait to order, savoring the\
  \ quiet, something that is forever elusive in the clamor of 8.5 million people in\
  \ Tehran. \n\tOur drowsy musings are suddenly interrupted by the boisterous arrival\
  \ of a group of women. Their laughter crashes into the peaceful haven, bringing\
  \ new life. They pour in, oblivious to our presence, and congregate in the center,\
  \ just at the point where the canopy opens and sunshine beams through, forming a\
  \ spotlight. Someone puts on traditional Persian dance music and they waste no time\
  \ shedding their headscarves. I am completely entranced. In other countries, such\
  \ behavior might be regarded as a slight annoyance, if remarked upon at all, but\
  \ in Iran, a country governed by strict, religious rule, where social gatherings\
  \ between the sexes are complicated at best, it feels like we\u2019re unintentional\
  \ participants in the most intimate, joyful rebellion in the world. Ever the gregarious\
  \ show-off, Hassan breaks our reverie, \u201CBia, come, let\u2019s find out who\
  \ they are.\u201D He says, getting up and heading in the women\u2019s direction.\
  \ \n\tAmir and I shake our heads and wince; our non-verbal way of saying definitely\
  \ not, but you go ahead and report back. The women are in a circle now, cheering\
  \ for one another as they take turns dancing in the center. They try to pull Amir\
  \ into the circle but his bravado crumbles at their unabashed nature. He turns back\
  \ to us, vigorously waving us over. We take pity on him and dutifully head over.\
  \ The energetic music and joyful trills of the women is infectious. I feel my heart\
  \ beat faster, racing to catch up with the music. A woman grabs my arm, smiling\
  \ broadly, and pulls me in, nodding for me to take a turn in the center. I hesitate\
  \ for a moment, before realizing I\u2019ve inadvertently been training for this\
  \ precise moment with my Bollywood classes, which have taught me how to confidently\
  \ move my body in sync with the music. I jump into the middle and let myself go,\
  \ feeling the music take over."
