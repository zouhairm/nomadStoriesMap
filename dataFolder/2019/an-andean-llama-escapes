Text: "Soli grinned at my nervously, we were still giddy with afternoon Pisco sours\
  \ and there was four local Peruvians crammed into the back of the car speaking nervously.\
  \  The driver, who had a minute ago been dodging rocks and bits of broken cactus,\
  \ now sat looking forward not saying anything. Everyone got out. We followed, walking\
  \ past the empty tour buses, over the odd boulder and under a volleyball net the\
  \ kids in the town had defiantly erected to stop anything on four wheels. This was\
  \ not exactly the trip to Machu Picchu we had planned. \n\nThe water privatisation\
  \ protests had closed the sacred valley for two days and we had found ourselves\
  \ right in the middle of road blocks out of Ollataytambo. Without any phone reception,\
  \ minimal Spanish and an apprehension one gets when you are not familiar with how\
  \ and if a local political situation will esculate, we walked on. Two hours later,\
  \ dark sky, no water, a woman and her husband rode up on a bike. \"How long have\
  \ you been walking?\" \"We know a shortcut - jump on\" we poorly translated from\
  \ Spanish. \n\nI grinned stupidly at Soli as our bikes kicked up down a steep gravel\
  \ road towards Urubamba. The wheels rutted along the sides of a railway track and\
  \ then out onto a smoother lakeside path. Soli and I grasped on tight, our sides\
  \ heaving with brightly coloured fabric print and an iconic toy llama stuffed in\
  \ my left pocket from the previous day. We were zooming! And then suddenly, we weren't.\n\
  \nStrung across the road in front was a halt. A woman sat, chin up, not making eye\
  \ contact, her children and dog at her feet equally calcified. \"No English\" our\
  \ drivers commanded, and two men driving hoped off and walked over towards the felled\
  \ tree and wire criss-crossing the road. Suddenly five other men arrived, heated\
  \ conversations, soles exchanged hands, the woman still brazenly staked her position\
  \ on the road, a machete or stick idling at her waist. The Peruvian government had\
  \ been pushing for water privatization and the mountain people in the Andes who\
  \ controlled the water access were resisting the commercialisation. A missed trip\
  \ to Machu Picchu hardly seemed significant. \"The foreigners need to catch a plane\
  \ tomorrow\" our driver pleaded. A uncomfortable moment, a begrudging sigh, an eyebrow\
  \ and then a wire lifted. \n\nShe let us pass. We breathed out together. In the\
  \ end it was not our protest, we were just tourists and our involvement was merely\
  \ inconvenient. We rode away and I got a glimpse back just as the toy llama inched\
  \ it's way out of my pocket and launched itself into the Andean night."
