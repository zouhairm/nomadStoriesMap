Text: "\u2018Dubai\u2019  always had an image of high rise structures with scintillating\
  \ shine all around and of course mammoth money. I was overwhelmed with energy and\
  \ the travel enthusiast in me was getting wild. The moment I landed the resplendent\
  \ city, the first word that crept through my ear was \u2018shukran\u2019. Ear sent\
  \ an instant signal to the grey matter and the hunt for the meaning was on. Thus,\
  \ moving ahead and passing by the men in white, men in immaculate white with gleaming\
  \ faces and a black strip on their heads we carved our way out to reach the ritzy\
  \ bus. Aiming at our visit to the tallest man made standing structure \u2018The\
  \ Burj Khalifa\u2019, it made the jaunt even more intoxicant with contentment. The\
  \ slumber caused by the flight journey vanished in the blink of an eyelid. Witnessing\
  \ the exquisite range of cars plying around and the scenic view of skyscrapers kept\
  \ your head high. \nAlas ! we reached Dubai mall which is an ingress to the towering\
  \ construction. Dubai mall was gigantic, swarming with stream of lights with ostentatious\
  \ four wheelers passing by. An urge to ride those galloping cars erupted like a\
  \ volcano which settled down like a lava as those receded away though keeping the\
  \ desire hot. As we entered the dazzling entrance there were numerous pathways with\
  \ the conspiracy for us to get disoriented in the congregation around. In no time,\
  \ an Indian cuisine was spotted and we rushed in. The vicinity had smiling and gesturing\
  \ faces and the taste bud arousal was surely universal. With the delectable taste\
  \ to beat the smell, we hunched over meals and guided our legs towards the prodigious\
  \ engineering marvel. \nThe aegis greeted us with a smile and as we displayed our\
  \ ticket, we were directed towards the elevator. With the pounding heart, the elevator\
  \ which could carry more than hundred persons at one time in lesser than a minute\
  \ to the 124th floor, we waited. The door opened and we stepped in with a jitter\
  \ heart. Sooner, it was time to egress, climbing the few steps lead us to the platform\
  \ on the porch. \nThe outlandish and exotic view from the falcon\u2019s eye view\
  \ was splendid and mesmerizing making all the other skyscrapers as dwarf world around.\
  \ A streak of cold sweat ran down my spine as I stepped further towards the balustrades\
  \ and watched my feet with hundreds of feet high. A sensation of flying high above\
  \ the world gave goosebumps and butterflies in the stomach. The scorching sun above\
  \ made us feel that we are still on the earth and not sky birds. The stroll towards\
  \ the upper storey gave a feeling of Gulliver in the lilliput world. The sensation\
  \ of sitting on the swing and swaying away made one feel at the end of the world.\
  \ With heart submerged in elation stepped towards the run down elevator. The defying\
  \ gravity act in the confined space gave yet another confound sensation to the nervous\
  \ system. Stepping out gave a sense of serenity and a sense of accomplishment of\
  \ a man on mission. \nMoving ahead made us witness drooping cigarette ash with intriguing\
  \ smoke covering us all around. It was a dribbling around which made us turn our\
  \ eyes to the exquisite fountain show. Have you ever seen such a beautiful fountain\
  \ of water that when you saw it you could say a million words? The water was like\
  \ crystals of glass through which you can see. The water seemed having no problems\
  \ as the giant drop easily slid down smoothly. The background music made me dwell\
  \ in to a parallel world making feel lonely amongst the crowd around . Mind getting\
  \ unconscious except for the rushing sound of water. Gradually, other sound begin\
  \ to filter through, hearing the clap of kids, the buzz of the friends around I\
  \ continued with my inner peace.  As I open my eyes and glaze at the sky it is azure\
  \ blue with white pillow clouds. \nGratitude expressed  to the almighty for this\
  \ experience and all of a sudden the word \u2018shukran\u2019 found its way out\
  \ of my mind as now the meaning was quite crystal clear."
