Text: "Sunday, January 27th, everything was so calm and a blue sky with sun so bright,\
  \ I even thought of walking with my husband at the end of the day, but we gave up\
  \ to enjoy a Sunday sundae in bed watching movies. \nSuddenly everything changed,\
  \ after seven o'clock we felt a gust of wind and the weather turned like magic.\
  \ At eight o'clock it was already a horror film, it was raining too much, the wind\
  \ was something absurdly scary of so strong and violent , struck the trees and the\
  \ coconut trees, almost folding in half, the noise he made resembled a gigantic\
  \ fan of these coarse ones that serve to ventilate large warehouses.\nThe water\
  \ of the sea arrived in my street and in all border of the city preventing the cars\
  \ from passing.\nThe whole city was without light, I could not see anything, just\
  \ listen to the noise of the wind, the sea and some objects beating, a night as\
  \ dark as I have never experienced.\nA nightmare that did not end. The information\
  \ in the group of messages of the journalists with whom my husband works, did not\
  \ stop. But all were comments from the fort that was in the storm. And the amazing\
  \ windstorm.\nMy husband was preparing to write his material and a photographer\
  \ of the team had already taken to the streets. The cameraman was ready too. But\
  \ all was still uncertain.\nUntil another photographer who works with my husband\
  \ sent a message to them: Luyan\xF3 is done! He left everyone hanging in anguish.\
  \ He was near his house in the Luyan neighborhood, driving his car, when he saw\
  \ a column of black wind coming down the same street. He thought it was the storm\
  \ itself, until he saw a column of black wind coming down the same street. He thought\
  \ it was the storm itself, until he saw a tank of 55 gallons of water on the windshield.\
  \ He leaned back in the copilot's chair and covered his head.\nHe had the car whipped\
  \ by a pile of rubble, all broken glass. Through the window on the side of him came\
  \ a stone that scratched his back.\nWhile he regained his breath, he sent the message\
  \ to his colleagues. It is the first time that Cubans face such a fact with 3G internet\
  \ on the cell phone. Before December of last year they did not have that service.\n\
  The tornado hangover that appeared in the middle of the extratropical storm, made\
  \ the city wake up sooner and realize what happened. Lots of people homeless, no\
  \ roof, trees on the ground, poles on the ground, debris on the street, traces of\
  \ the sea waves, places that were flooded, destruction.\nI have seen neighbors sheltering\
  \ entire families who have lost everything in their own home. It was not in the\
  \ house of relatives, it was the neighbors themselves who helped each other. During\
  \ the trip to distribute food, clothes and toiletries in the most affected regions,\
  \ I listened to stories and I saw a lot of solidarity from those who had very little\
  \ but shared what they had.\nI heard the story of a lady who was serving dinner\
  \ on the table and went to look at the gate that loud noise was that. As soon as\
  \ she reached the gate she did not even have time to look at what was in front of\
  \ her and she felt the house collapsing on the whole family. They flew the two roofs\
  \ of the neighboring houses on their little one-story house, there was nothing left\
  \ but rubble. Another lady who out of curiosity left the street was thrown against\
  \ a wall that was across the street with her daughter on her lap. Everyone who witnessed\
  \ this phenomenon felt a pressure and a noise as if it were a plane turbine, there\
  \ was no way to defend itself.\nTornados are not common in Cuba. The last resemblance\
  \ to this happened in 1941. Havana recovers its wounded and cries for the six who\
  \ died.\nAll embracing the cause of unity and solidarity, artists, ordinary people,\
  \ neighbors, all helping each other because it is so in Cuba."
