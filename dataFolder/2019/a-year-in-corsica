Text: It was 2005 I had just finished my undergraduate degree in Visual Arts and English
  Literature and had begun learning the beautiful French language in rural Quebec,
  Canada. I was looking for opportunities to continue improving my French language
  skills while also getting work experience when I stumbled across a now defunct program
  through the French government. I had only been abroad once in my life and but had
  caught the travel bug. I wanted to return to Europe and explore a different place.
  I decided to give the job a try. It involved teaching children English lessons in
  a specified region of France. By mere chance, two flights and a Newfoundland roommate
  later I ended up in the little known mediterranean island of Corsica. This story
  will unravel both my personal experience of being an Anglophone in Corsica while
  also exploring the intricacies and beautiful landscapes of this fascinating island.
  The Corsican people, language and history are fascinating with a culture largely
  unknown and misunderstood. Outside of tourist season the island is virtually uninhabited
  with a shrinking population of those who can even speak the native language of Corsican.
  Few tourists visit the island outside of tourist season which gave me the opportunity
  to truly get to know this unique, compelling and strikingly beautiful place.
