Text: "Wondering how you can get lost in Paris while having your mobile maps turned\
  \ on? This is actually possible when you rely too much on technology. We all do\
  \ this nowadays as we think smartphones buy us time or maybe it was just the Universe\
  \ telling me that I was on vacation and I should leave my phone aaa\u2026 well to\
  \ recharge and take a break of his own. I was having my flight back home in the\
  \ same day but that would not stop me of enjoying my last hours in the city of light.\n\
  \nLast year\u2019s FIFA World Cup ended with an enormous party on the streets of\
  \ Paris as France was crowned the winner. The city just woke up after their incredible\
  \ celebration of their national day July 14th. If someone knows how to set a city\
  \ on fire, metaphorically speaking, these are the Parisians. I felt like I was attending\
  \ a carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Streets were crowded with people singing their anthem,\
  \ dancing, shouting from the top of their lungs \u201CVive la France\u201D while\
  \ fireworks were still popping. Imagine the entire city in a festive mood for almost\
  \ 48h hours. Anyone would thing they have landed at the biggest festival ever. As\
  \ a tourist I got to see a whole different side of Paris as I generally believe\
  \ that a place is made by its people and if you want to ever go back you will do\
  \ it because you can recall a feeling from the people that crossed your path. Sights,\
  \ buildings and museums are everywhere but emotion is unique.\n\nI wanted to get\
  \ into that vibe so I thought to explore my last day from a top point, starting\
  \ from the Basilica Sacr\xE9 Coeur down to River Seine and its bridges and see how\
  \ the locals were celebrating. According to my phone, that would have taken me around\
  \ 1 hour so I still got plenty of time to go back to the hotel and then straight\
  \ to the airport. This was the plan but as one should know by now, things don\u2019\
  t always go as planned especially if your battery is already on save mode. As I\
  \ started to descend from the Sacr\xE9 Coeur hill, every bar and restaurant were\
  \ celebrating in their own way, either offering free drinks or having special promotions.\
  \ There are exactly 248 steps to climb Monmartre Sacr\xE9 Couer but if you descend\
  \ it, it won\u2019t be that painful. Along the way the diversity in terms of bars\
  \ is fascinating and the line between a cafe, salon de th\xE9 (tearoom), bistro,\
  \ brasserie, bar and even bar \xE0 vins (wine bar) is blurred. The line between\
  \ drinking and clubbing is often non-existent, a cafe that\u2019s quiet mid-afternoon\
  \ might have DJ sets in the evening and dancing later on and that weekend was the\
  \ highlight of street nightlife. Having tried to \u201Cfl\xE2ner \xE0 Paris\u201D\
  \ which means to stroll around the city and one of Parisians favourite activity,\
  \ I lost track of time. By the time I realized, I had 1% battery and a burning phone.\
  \ The maps app kept spinning me in circles telling me that I am a 10 minutes\u2019\
  \ walk from the hotel. I was passing near the same bars, at least 3 times, and people\
  \ were starting to recognize me. Needless to say, I should have been heading towards\
  \ the airport but I was too strung-out from the atmosphere and the people around\
  \ that I kept stopping at the same places and continued the discussions from where\
  \ we left them. In all that scene of fiesta, for them the situation was hilarious.\
  \ For me not so much but I could not have helped it and allowed myself to get dragged\
  \ in once again.\n\nI did fly that night but on top of one of the highest place\u2019\
  s in Paris, The Eiffel Tower\u2026.. waved gently to my plane and decided to extend\
  \ my trip. Bad luck can sometimes be considered best luck depending how you see\
  \ the experience. I made friends among the locals and got to celebrate like a Parisian.\
  \ Embrace the unexpected and the change. It may lead you to new adventures."
