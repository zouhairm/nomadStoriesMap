Text: "\"It's just a Christmas party, it's not like it's going to hurt\" she said\
  \ with exasperation, as the color began to drain from my face. The name explains\
  \ it all: Chante No\xEBl, or Chant\xE9 Nw\xE8l is a unique tradition in Martinique\
  \ where people come together and sing christmas carols in unison to the rhythm of\
  \ a live creole band. Celebrated as one of the biggest festivities of the year,\
  \ there are several Chante Noel parties held across the island from the beginning\
  \ of December to Christmas Day. The concept is always the same: each guest pays\
  \ an entry fee which covers the cost of the band and main course, and a potluck\
  \ style contribution is required. Those who have gardens bring freshly pressed juice\
  \ while rum connoisseurs bring Shrubb, the mother of Christmas cocktails carefully\
  \ crafted from dried orange peels, sugarcane syrup, and white rum.\n\nWe were standing\
  \ at the door of the party, and there was no turning back. The rum had been purchased,\
  \ and I was to attend whether I caught a case of stage fright or not. All my worries\
  \ subsided as we entered, and I was swept off my feet by the familiar and the foreign.\
  \ There was a sweet Christmas ham on the table that had been marinated to perfection.\
  \ Children were outside chasing each other through the banana trees while the adults\
  \ chattered away on the patio. Drinks like coconut rum and guava juice began to\
  \ flow as seats began to fill up around the dance floor. Aside from the banana trees,\
  \ this was not unlike my family Christmas parties in Los Angeles. \n\nAfter diner\
  \ was served a band appeared, bringing everyone onto their feet. As it turns out,\
  \ the Chante Noel is not a spectator sport; everyone is expected to participate.\
  \ I hardly had a chance to feel afraid as the woman next to me grabbed my hand and\
  \ lead me to the dance floor. \nShe pulled a green book out of her purse and pointed\
  \ to the lyrics. I stumbled over words and lost my place often, but someone was\
  \ always there to help by pointing out the correct page or singing a little louder\
  \ so no one heard my butchered Creole. \n\nBefore I knew it I was chanting at the\
  \ top of my lungs, the vibrations from drums sending a ripple down my spine. My\
  \ confidence soared as a familiar tune wafted through the air. Suddenly I found\
  \ myself doing my best Mariah Carey impression of Douce Nuit, the French equivalent\
  \ of Silent Night, along with 40 other eager participants. Chante Noel is intimate,\
  \ but it is not small by any means.\n\nThe event began in the afternoon and carried\
  \ on into the night. In the same way I was pulled out to the dance floor, I am now\
  \ reluctantly one of the last to leave. Perhaps it\u2019s the shrubb, but I am buzzing\
  \ with energy. We help take everything down, and as we head out the door we call\
  \ out cheerful goodbyes that are as warm as the evening air. \u201CA bientot\u201D\
  \ - see you soon!"
