Text: "It was a long flight. First 10 hour flight for me and the baby alone. We survived.\
  \ \nArrived in Belgrade after approximately no sleep for me or the baby - because.\
  \ \nThat\u2019s something you learn with the baby, some things are just because\
  \ and maybe, some things are just because life and travels are way too exciting\
  \ for someone. And I\u2019m not even talking about the baby, I am exactly the same,\
  \ always too excited to be thrilled by new places and things. \n\nBelgrade greeted\
  \ us with people fighting as we started landing, about who will carry my luggage.\n\
  \n Chivalry isn\u2019t dead in Serbia.\n\nWe landed and one person carried the stroller,\
  \ another my hand luggage and third my suitcases. \n\nWarmth envelopes you in Serbia\
  \ before you even realize it. \n\nOf course my siblings and parents waited for us\
  \ at the airport. Waited as a very loose term for them running through the airport\
  \ to almost get in the forbidden arrivals area just so they can squeeze both of\
  \ us, completely ignoring the people rush that\u2019s trying to push through the\
  \ sliding doors behind us. \n\nLove is a way of life in Serbia.\n\nAs we are trying\
  \ to fit all of us in the car, I love all the heads turning around and popping out\
  \ with questions slurred from overjoy. I wish the same for my future. One emotionally,\
  \ spiritually and intellectually rich living full of people. \n\nWe arrived home,\
  \ well my old home. Driving through endless new supermarkets and malls and ikeas.\
  \ And I wondered if those are the only things changing. Sure people are getting\
  \ older, but life there seems content and more less the same as it was. It\u2019\
  s just the way they\u2019re spending money and who they\u2019re giving it to that\u2019\
  s different. I wasn\u2019t sure at the moment if that was worrisome or not. \nBut\
  \ I soon forgot about all of that as we entered the house and were greeted with\
  \ fresh Cevapi, pita, kajmak and a whole load of fruit and veggies that mama knows\
  \ I love. \n\nThe food isn\u2019t GMOed in Serbia. \n\nThank God.\nSometimes while\
  \ in New York I dream of the Serbian food, and even my husband who\u2019s English\
  \ does too. \n\nWe ate and went to sleep, well at least I did - they played with\
  \ the tireless baby. The advantage of having younger parents and 4 siblings! \n\
  At 3 am baby was delivered to my room almost asleep. And I was grateful. \n\nBeing\
  \ considerate is how you are raised to grow up in Serbia. \n\nThe morning started\
  \ and I took my shoes out planning to drop them off for repairs at the local shoe\
  \ repair guy across the street. A guy that I\u2019ve known for years, working in\
  \ a space that doesn\u2019t fit more people than just him inside. Always so lovely,\
  \ cheerful and somewhat of a character you\u2019d find in a Mary Poppins film.\n\
  \n I still remember the day before I left for Austria to do my college audition\
  \ at 16 years old, I stopped by to pick up my shoes and he wished me a wonderful\
  \ trip and blessed my career however the audition turns out. From that moment on,\
  \ I believed that his blessing was my lucky charm and I took it with me everywhere\
  \ I went. \n\nBlessings come alive in Serbia. \n\nAs I turned the corner he was\
  \ sitting outside the shop and as I started talking I realized shop is completely\
  \ empty, bare of shoes and shelves and equipment. I saw his red eyes and I asked\
  \ what I already knew was happening. \u201CNo more business\u201D he said with so\
  \ much sadness. He continued on trying to advise me on the best repair shop I could\
  \ take my shoes to, and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what is this wonderful\
  \ man going to do now to survive.\n\nI guess those big malls and stores really did\
  \ make a difference. \n\nPoverty is real in Serbia. \n\nAnd man did he have a talent\
  \ for the shoes. \nOne day when angels fly by they will say \u201C there lived a\
  \ man who was among the best in the world in his field\u201D \n\nSerbia has some\
  \ of the best people in the world."
