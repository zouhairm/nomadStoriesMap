Text: "The thought of trying Tequila at its source in Mexico was fascinating. Going\
  \ into Mexico on a week long adventure with little-to-none Spanish fluency and it\
  \ being my first time in the Latin Americas, I was prepared to be surprised at every\
  \ turn, but of all of them, was my experience trying out El Pajarete - the drink\
  \ of the early bird. \n\nMy friends and I had landed in Guadalajara a day ago on\
  \ Christmas Eve and had spent Christmas day exploring the city on foot visiting\
  \ old churches, local markets, and eating Al Pastor tacos at every taco stand we\
  \ spotted. The next morning, we made some last minute plans to hire a car, drive\
  \ to the town of Tequila to see some distilleries, and return before midday so we\
  \ could take the bus to Puerto Vallarta - our next destination in Mexico. After\
  \ an early start, we began driving through the rustic stretches of Jalisco. Not\
  \ long after leaving the city boundaries, the vistas really opened up. All that\
  \ lay ahead was large expanses of Agave fields dotted with distilleries every mile\
  \ or so. Cruising along on a crisp winter morning with vast stretches of desert\
  \ was simply beautiful and the drive was already worth the early start. \n\nOur\
  \ driver, Oscar, was a friendly chap who quickly realized that my Spanish was no\
  \ bueno and tried his darnedest best to be as helpful guide with his broken English.\
  \ Never one to shy away from the unknown, I asked him if he knew where to get coffee.\
  \ Five minutes of handwaving and broken Spanish and English later, I was convinced\
  \ that he had found a unique experience for my friends and I to try on the way to\
  \ Tequila.\n\nAs we continued driving down the still sleepy country roads, we stopped\
  \ at what looked like a shack with some burly men in wifebeaters and worn shirts\
  \ standing around, sipping on their drinks and chatting. Oscar looked back into\
  \ the car with the huge grin - \"Vamos!\". I went, of course. As did two other friends.\
  \ Oscar said something to the guy at the table in quick Spanish and he pounded two\
  \ large empty glasses. He mixed in some cocoa, poured what looked like vodka from\
  \ a questionable bottle, and some cane sugar. I wouldn't have expected what came\
  \ next in the line of ingredients. He walked over to a large brown cow next to the\
  \ shack and milked her right into the glass. He then came back over and handed it\
  \ to me as I looked on, bewildered. \n\nMy conventional wisdom told me that drinking\
  \ raw milk was bad, and that I shouldn't attempt this in a foreign country where\
  \ I didn't speak the language, or know what to do in an emergency. But of course,\
  \ my spirit got the better of me. Everyone at the shop had started looking at our\
  \ group as we clearly appeared alien in this setting of country cowboys. As the\
  \ locals egged us on, I took a sip first, and then immediately, a big gulp. It was\
  \ nothing like I expected. Hot, sweet, and bitter at the same time, the drink was\
  \ utterly delicious! The fresh milk wasn't just warm, it was piping hot. The sweet\
  \ from the cocoa and cane sugar cut through the bitterness of the alcohol really\
  \ well. I found out later that the alcohol kills off any germs in the fresh milk\
  \ rendering it safe.\n\nA morning wake-up like the one I'd just had, was just not\
  \ what I had expected to find when I asked for a coffee stop. My friends held themselves\
  \ back and stopped at a few sips, unlike me. As we put our glasses down and got\
  \ ready to leave, some of the guys came over and asked how it was. Still a bit overwhelmed,\
  \ I responded with a \"Mmmm\" as I licked my lips, and a thumbs up and got into\
  \ the car, looking forward to what other surprises the day had in store for us as\
  \ we wandered off into the fields."
