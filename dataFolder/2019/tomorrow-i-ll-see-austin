Text: "I knew I was doomed from the first morning I woke up in Austin. Flying in late\
  \ the night before, my travel-weary self fell asleep without removing my contacts\
  \ and one now lay dried and torn on the cheap cotton sheets of the dorm bed, evidently\
  \ having slipped out of my eye sometime in the night. Foolishly, I hadn\u2019t brought\
  \ another pair of contacts with me or even my backup glasses. I thought of the long\
  \ week ahead of me and the next days confirmed my thoughts as prophetic: visiting\
  \ a university for an academic conference, I spent each day shielded from the sweltering\
  \ Austin humidity and unrelenting sun by air conditioned classrooms with fluorescent\
  \ lighting where I listened to educators lecture about economics and squinted desperately\
  \ at whiteboards. In both a literal and a more figurative sense: I wasn\u2019t seeing\
  \ Austin.\nAt the end of the week, the academic courses were finished and students\
  \ had no more obligations - a window of opportunity to finally leave campus. We\
  \ were filled with anxious excitement, a collection of strangers turned acquaintances\
  \ from universities around the globe, gathered together with feverishly-made alliances\
  \ for a night out on the town. I accepted an invitation to pregame in someone\u2019\
  s dorm before we would venture out to Austin\u2019s famous (and infamous) Sixth\
  \ Street. \nThe dorm was crowded with too many of us - loud, filled with inauthentic\
  \ Tex-Mex cuisine from the St. Edward\u2019s cafeteria, and passing back and forth\
  \ bottles of Captain Morgan like our lives depended on it.  I choked and sputtered\
  \ on the spiced rum, disliking how it seared down my throat but craving the adventure\
  \ it promised. After awhile, someone was shouting over the music - the Ubers were\
  \ here.\nWe crammed into cars and the illuminated city flooded past us as a blurred\
  \ scene, too quickly for our rum-addled brains to appreciate. For the first time\
  \ all week, I was unbothered by my poor vision. Drunkenness was to thank for that.\n\
  Soon we arrived and spilled out of our cars into the throng of Sixth Street goers.\
  \ Each side of the street was lined with club after club, doors open to embrace\
  \ the warm July night, music pouring out onto the street and mingling with voices\
  \ to create a deafening roar. Blindly, I followed the group to a line where we shuffled\
  \ forward toward the bouncer and proudly presented our IDs and cash cover. I remember\
  \ little about inside the club other than flashing neon lights, a DJ, and knowing\
  \ just how drunk I was. Forget any semblance of Texas charm or distinguishability\
  \ - a club was a club and I could\u2019ve been anywhere.\nWe danced all night, our\
  \ group dwindling from two dozen of us down to six. The lights turned on and the\
  \ DJ was yelling for everyone to get out. \u201CI don\u2019t care where you go but\
  \ you can\u2019t stay here.\u201D  We wandered out like lost children, finding a\
  \ park bench and waiting for Uber prices to fall. My thoughts were still fuzzy from\
  \ drinking and now also laden with desire for sleep. Maybe tomorrow morning before\
  \ my flight, I thought. Tomorrow I\u2019ll see Austin. My one night in a new city\
  \ was hardly any Eat, Pray, Love and mostly Drink, Drink, Drink.\nI anxiously await\
  \ my triumphant return someday, to see Austin."
