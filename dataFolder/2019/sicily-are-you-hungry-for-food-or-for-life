Text: "'Are you hungry for food or for life?'  In a cramped, cigarette smoke-filled\
  \ apartment just outside the city of Catania in Sicily, I sat with this question\u2026\
  \ and with a huge plate of home-made lasagne glaring back at me!\n\nLet me rewind\
  \ this story a little... \nI had just turned thirty and I was on my first European\
  \ holiday; in fact, only my second overseas holiday, ever! After five incredible\
  \ weeks spent exploring the lights of London & Paris, the vibrancy of Amsterdam,\
  \ the history of Berlin, the rich culture of Prague and the depths of 40-degree\
  \ ancient thermal baths of Budapest, I was now on the last leg of my journey of\
  \ a lifetime. \n\nI had ticked my ultimate bucket list items; To be sipping Limoncello\
  \ of Sorrento in Italy, riding a vintage bicycle through the hills of Chianti in\
  \ Tuscany, driving the winding coastline of the Costiera Amalfitana with tour guides\
  \ on their so-called \u2018first day\u2019 on the job (aka how they like to entertain\
  \ tourists into peeing their pants!) and I can\u2019t forget cruising to the isle\
  \ of Capri - once docked asking \u2018quanto costa?\u2019 for everything! Could\
  \ I actually afford that 10 Euro latte?! Now I was ready to explore my Sicilian\
  \ roots. \n\nOh Catania how beautiful you are, but your airport, Dear Lord! Arriving\
  \ 3 hours early makes no difference to a county that prides itself on long, glorious\
  \ lunches, four-course dinners and wine with every other meal. Sitting around the\
  \ dinner table across from family I had never met, drinking wine I had never tasted\
  \ and experiencing a country I never had before, I wanted so much in that moment\
  \ to give up the life I had known and embrace this unfamiliar way, perhaps even\
  \ the \u2018Sicilian\u2019 way. After all, wasn\u2019t it my true heritage calling?\
  \ I felt I had work to do - to revive the vineyard my grandfather once owned. \n\
  \nSo back to the question at heart. What was I actually hungry for? Adventure, resilience,\
  \ courage to start a new life on the other side of the world? Sicily was speaking\
  \ to me. She was saying, \u2018My love, you are playing small in this world! You\
  \ have one life, what do you want to do with it? What do you want to be known for?\u2019\
  \ \n\nIt's only when you\u2019re quiet enough do you find the answers to questions\
  \ you never knew you had. That's the crazy thing about life, isn't it?"
