Text: "The Coliseum in Rome was bigger than life and the backstory of the colossal\
  \ statue lost to time made for interesting trivia to show off when I got home. Our\
  \ random visit to see the remains of the ancient aqueduct using a hidden road behind\
  \ a private sports club was surprisingly educational too. Even the spontaneous tour\
  \ of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica(skipping the insane long winding lines) by slipping\
  \ the guard at the exit 20 Euros was a fun little diversion for a day. However,\
  \ the most memorable part of visiting the middle of Italy was the late dinner the\
  \ night before we flew home. \n\nAfter rushing around to get last minute souvenirs\
  \ from the Vatican Post Office and indulging in just one more touristy gelato shop\
  \ for the road, we decided on a final 10pm meal with my aunt\u2019s friend, a retired\
  \ tour guide who ran a B&B just steps from the heart of the city. We were literally\
  \ having evening dinner at an archetypal Italian sidewalk cafe owned by a family\
  \ who lived in the same building. \n\nIn hindsight, I should have had a slice of\
  \ rib eye steak freshly cut from the dry aging slab in the display case, just to\
  \ see how the flavor would compare to a Texas porterhouse back home. Out of habit,\
  \ I opted for the Italian comfort food which magically reminds of my beloved mashed\
  \ potatoes: a simple plate of gnocchi to tuck away in my food memories for later.\
  \ Of course it was delicious\u2026 each bite was a perfect pillow of potato goodness...\
  \ and perfectly satisfying. \n\nAs an after dinner liqueur, the server and adult\
  \ daughter of the restaurant owners offered us limoncello, which they made in house\
  \ from her grandfather\u2019s recipe. Imagine a vodka lemon drop in a glass to finish\
  \ off a quintessential Italian meal under the stars in Rome. It was absolutely the\
  \ perfect storybook travel memory.\n\nAs we were getting ready to leave, I asked\
  \ our server an off hand question from my own childhood of being raised in a restaurant\
  \ a lifetime ago, on the other side of the world. Obviously, I would probably never\
  \ run into her again but my curiosity got the better of me. No matter where I traveled,\
  \ I always felt an unspoken kinship with others brought up in the restaurant life.\n\
  \n\u201CI had to work in my parents restaurant growing up too. It is good to support\
  \ your family but I hope you have something great you are passionate about for yourself!\u201D\
  \ \n\nShe responded with a knowing look, \u201CI do aerial like in Cirque du Soleil\
  \ and I love it so much.\u201D\n\nDespite feeling quite stuffed from dinner and\
  \ relaxed from the limoncello, I quickly climbed the nearby 15 foot street light\
  \ and happily waved down to her from the top. She laughed in pure delighted surprise!\
  \ After I carefully made my way down, I told her to keep her dreams alive and I\
  \ said goodbye.\n\n* * *\nA few years prior, I also learned aerial silks because\
  \ a local studio had opened up down the street from my apartment in Los Angeles\
  \ and I had to try it.\n\nNo matter how far or how much you travel, the world is\
  \ always smaller than you think."
