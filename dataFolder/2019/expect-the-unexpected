Text: "Metallic smell of blood in the air. Loud machines inside the boning room. Loud\
  \ animals arriving in big trucks right next to my house. Working days starting at\
  \ 3 am. Long hours inside a freezing cold room. White uniforms stained with red.\
  \ \n\nI was paying a high price for my 8-month adventure in Asia. I worked here\
  \ and there along my way to the amazing land of Oz not to spend the money I had\
  \ saved back in Argentina. This, I thought, would allow me to live until I would\
  \ find a job and settle for a while. However, there are things that you can\u2019\
  t predict. \n\nHow was I suppose to know that someone in a night bus was going to\
  \ steal all the money I had in my handbag? Or that it was going to be so hard to\
  \ find a job once in Australia just the opposite of what people was saying?  \n\n\
  Somehow things got complicated and after 8 months of amazing freedom I was once\
  \ again caged in an awful routine. When I started working in the factory I had only\
  \ $150 Australian dollars in my pocket. I had no choice but accepting the offer.\
  \ \n\nI moved to this little town in WA, I had no car and no public transport was\
  \ available over there. I was stuck. I promised myself to leave that place as soon\
  \ I had saved enough money to pay a debt and some more to be able to go back to\
  \ the city and find something better. Time went by, I paid my debt and gave me one\
  \ more month in the factory to save a bit more. Not everything was bad there. I\
  \ shared the house with Filipinos and Burmese people. They couldn\u2019t speak English\
  \ very well but we could get along rather good. \n\nI was far from home, alone and\
  \ isolated. The depression started creeping in and after a while I was no longer\
  \ myself anymore.\n\nI heard once that there are some things you learn best in the\
  \ storm. In that little, isolated town in the middle of one of my worst personal\
  \ storms I ever lived I touched the bottom of my misery and despair. Once again\
  \ I was paralyze by the fear of the unknown and I was choosing the hideous known\
  \ routine to taking the risk of stepping out and doing something different.    \n\
  \nLuckily nothing is permanent in this Universe and the right person always finds\
  \ you in the right time. This time was a phone call from the antipodeans.. my Argentinean\
  \ friend\u2019s voice in the other side of the line was a sweet magic balm for my\
  \ wounded soul. I cried out loud all my sorrows. I obviously was not healed but\
  \ at least I could manage to stand up straight and put the pieces of my wounded\
  \ self together. A week later I managed to hit the road again. \n\nNew destination:\
  \ Melbourne!"
