Text: "Since i was a child i wanted to know Ireland so bad, something called me, a\
  \ green ribbon, the song of the sheeps, the unraveling stories of the celt fae.\
  \ All these was so appealing to me. I arrived to the Holy Head station i got into\
  \ the ferry. Everything was marvelous cold, the scenery was gloomy even in that\
  \ summer, so i took my cozy bordeos sweater, and my beloved dragonfly scarf. I walked\
  \ through the ferry, in the top, enduring the coldness of the trip i found three\
  \ wonderful guys, they told me that Ireland was a dream for tourist but not so much\
  \ for the locals. They were returning from scotland, because there was possible\
  \ to find better jobs. I ask them if they were going to stay in Dublin that night,\
  \ inmediatly they offered themselves as guides of the marvelous night life of Dublin.\
  \ \n\nThat awsome kindness blow my mind, we talked a lot and they made me believe\
  \ the Irish Santa Claus was a green one and that the lucky trebol was also a christmas\
  \ symbol. They wanted to know about my original country, so i told them that mexican\
  \ people and the irish gals had too much in common. A great passion for life, a\
  \ good taste for food and beer. So we laugh a lot while the movement of ferry carried\
  \ on, and that night we walked to st. Gogarties pub and drink four pints of Guinness,\
  \ to know the center of Dublin with this boys was really amazing, they told me many\
  \ interesting stories about what happened on each side of the river. So that's a\
  \ night and a travel i will never forget."
