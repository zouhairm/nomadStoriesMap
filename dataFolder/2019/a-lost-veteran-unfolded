Text: "To investigate the correct spelling of a surname that originates from Portugal.\
  \ My great, great - GREAT grandfather came on a boat after the war and sailed into\
  \ New Zealand. His name was spelt differently when he was lined up like a refugee\
  \ to give his details. The correct spelling has been unknown to this day - and I\
  \ long to find. I have recently discovered that the woman he met in Portgual was\
  \ from Germany. But the trail to my blood line has been lost and forgotten. \nNow,\
  \ with a degree in creative writing, a FB group page for people to share anything\
  \ they know about the surname - I am on the hunt to rejoin my family with a story\
  \ that's never been told. A mission to correct a surname and find  family abroad.\
  \ \n\nStories have been scrabbled among family conversations but none have been\
  \ certain. What has been found - is the plaque of where he rests.  Not far from\
  \ where I stay and not one flower leaning on his stone. My family are unaware of\
  \ his address but now; 5 generations later - I was the one to find it. But how can\
  \ I start a novel without the correct spelling to use as a title?"
