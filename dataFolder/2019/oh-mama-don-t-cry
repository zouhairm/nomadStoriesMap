Text: "Mama and I sat on her porch step in Tshabo Township enjoying our final bowl\
  \ of Umphokogo and watching sunset. In the afternoon, when Biko and Soso went to\
  \ play in the park, she and I took advantage of our alone time to practice my poorly\
  \ developed Xhosa. IsiXhosa was not a language that came naturally to me. It wasn\u2019\
  t like Spanish or Portuguese, which I had picked up relatively easily. Learning\
  \ Xhosa required hours of sitting in my bedroom practicing my \u201Ctongue clicks\u201D\
  \ for the letters: \u201Cx\u201D, \u201Cc\u201D, and \u201Cq\u201D. This alone had\
  \ taken me weeks to master. But when it came time to apply said clicks to an entire\
  \ word, such as \u201CNdicela\u201D, (translation: \u201Cplease\u201D), those weeks\
  \ of practicing my clicking and clacking resulted worthless. \n\tMany days, I could\
  \ see the frustration painted across Mama Gowa\u2019s face that I was not improving.\
  \ Her looks of disappointment shamed me. Of course, Mama spoke perfect English and\
  \ Afrikaans as a result of South Africa\u2019s apartheid, but I longed to communicate\
  \ with Mama in her mother tongue. For me, it was a sign of respect. I was determined\
  \ not to be just another umlungu (white) student taking advantage of Apartheids\
  \ legacy, but integrate myself in a culture that Western globalization had left\
  \ behind. \n\tYet, day after day, sunset after sunset, I continued to struggle with\
  \ no avail in sight. My second to last day in Tshabo, I asked her if we could leave\
  \ classes behind and simply reflect on life. I wanted to hear about the stories\
  \ that she had to share and the wisdom she had to teach. \n\tShoving one spoonful\
  \ more of Umphokogo in her mouth, she smiled at me. \u201CI don\u2019t have much\
  \ to share. Life since the death of my husband has been pleasant enough. Some days\
  \ bring more pain than others. Yet, the world does not allow us to be sad. We must\
  \ continue forward.\u201D \n\tHer words resonated with me, \u201CI understand\u201D\
  , I mumbled. Five days before, I had experienced my own loss of a loved one. My\
  \ father had died only one week into my journey to South Africa. I had left California\
  \ knowing that he would be gone by the time I returned. Yet, I was not expecting\
  \ his death to coincide with the exact moment that I was trying to assimilate to\
  \ a new community, culture, and language. Mama knew nothing about it. I had told\
  \ no one. As someone who is not comfortable with close personal relationships, I\
  \ had decided to carry the burden of my fathers death with me, alone. \n\tYet, in\
  \ that moment of Mama\u2019s honesty, on her porch step, over our final bowl of\
  \ mixed crumbly mealie pap and amasi (sour milk), I became soft. Tears streamed\
  \ down my sunburnt cheek. I realised suddenly that neither Mama nor I had the luxury\
  \ of grieving the death of our loved ones. We had to move on with our lives. For\
  \ Mama, it was because of her children and grandchildren. She still had the responsibility\
  \ of raising a family and managing her farm. For me, it was the sheer fact that\
  \ I was an invited person in an unknown country. Our differences were astronomical,\
  \ but I understood our inevitable understanding: we, as human beings rarely have\
  \ the opportunity to grieve sufficiently within the moment that someone we loves\
  \ passes away. Yet, the beauty behind such a challenging world is that we are able\
  \ to meet people who carry the same burden as we do no matter the language, culture,\
  \ or country. In this moment, Mama and I were given the luxury of holding one another\
  \ and letting the judgment of the world around us fall."
