Text: "The local connection I had made and the experiences I was fortunate to participate\
  \ in with this individual on this trip still remind me why I developed a fervour\
  \ for travel. That still affects me four years after this story has taken place.\
  \ I had been blessed with the chance, at the age of 16, to take part in a brief\
  \ exchange in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province in China. I had always been fascinated with\
  \ differences in culture, especially between Asian and Western, so it was an experience\
  \ I had grasped eagerly with both hands. \n\nAs excited as I was to be discovering\
  \ this city I hadn't known anything about, the overnight train from Beijing to Xi'an\
  \ made me able to appreciate the most uncomfortable train journeys and the ability\
  \ to sleep on what was basically a wooden shelf of questionable safety.  Arriving\
  \ in Xi'an at 9 am, jet lagged but still somehow bright eyed with curiosity at this\
  \ country that made me feel like I had arrived in a parallel universe. To this day,\
  \ the entire trip seems more like a vivid fever dream I concocted, rather than a\
  \ real life experience. I was partnered with a girl I shall name Jing for anonyminity.\
  \ Jing was tasked with looking after me for the four days I was in Xi'an and was\
  \ dedicated to showing me this ancient but modernising city. When I think about\
  \ our first meeting, I remember how she enthusiastically greeted me, trying her\
  \ best to speak in clear English. We quickly realised over the first hour that we\
  \ had some interests in common. Both of us had a love for art, photography and eating\
  \ good food. The last one lead to Jing and her mother, a very kind woman, who worked\
  \ as a lawyer, taking me to try hot pot for the first time. They both laughed at\
  \ me, as I realised my tolerance for spice was not as great as I thought it was\
  \ and it took two days for my tongue to stop being sore from this mistake.\n\nEven\
  \ though I was 16 and definitely too young to legally drink in China, it didn't\
  \ stop us from joining some other exchange partners to a house party in a very fancy\
  \ apartment, owned by one of the groups parents. Halloween isn't really celebrated\
  \ in China, however, this younger generation had grown up more exposed to western\
  \ cultures and went all out for this party. Me and Jing had managed to get a rather\
  \ foul tasting Chinese liquor to share from a rather dodgy vender. Much of the night\
  \ has been lost to me, due to being a lightweight and the passage of time that followed.\
  \ Us, British participants, were encouraged to join in with Karaoke, then afterwards\
  \ we showed the Chinese party goers how to play Ring of Fire. Even though much of\
  \ the night is faded from memory, I remember laughing so much that my stomach ached.\
  \ Also walking home with Jing and seeing how the streets of Xi'an looked at night,\
  \ with lanterns strung up in front of buildings and market stalls padlocked shut.\
  \ Unfortunately the cheap Chinese alcohol gave us both some killer headaches, which\
  \ didn't leave us as we spent the day visiting the Terracotta Army. \n\nI hadn't\
  \ known what to expect, when I started this trip, I thought it would be sight seeing\
  \ and eating food I was unaccustomed to. It was both of those things but also learning\
  \ that teenagers in China like to drink underage as much as British ones. Also that\
  \ no matter how different two cultures are, you can find similarities to celebrate.\
  \ Even though I have lost contact with Jing in the four years that have passed,\
  \ I am still grateful for giving me this experience and for making me feel so at\
  \ home in a country and culture so different from my own."
