Text: "I did not expect to find self-compassion while walking the Camino de Santiago\
  \ (or the Way of St. James, as it\u2019s called in English). As a Spanish major,\
  \ it seemed like a natural rite of passage to complete this centuries-old pilgrimage\
  \ before embarking on my graduate degree. It didn\u2019t hurt that, as an avid hiker,\
  \ the nearly 800 km of the French Way seemed like an eminently achievable long-distance\
  \ hike\u2014 unlike other thru hikes, I\u2019d only have to carry my clothes, toiletries,\
  \ and maybe some food depending on the day\u2019s route. \n\nEven so, there wasn\u2019\
  t very much that went right on the first few days of my journey. Leaving Paris,\
  \ I almost missed my train to St. Jean Pied de Port, a remote town at the base of\
  \ the French Pyrenees and the traditional starting point of the French Way. After\
  \ crossing the Pyrenees with not enough food, I nearly passed out in the foyer of\
  \ the first refuge (in Spanish, refugio) in the small medieval town of Roncesvalles\
  \ (25 km). In Zubiri (46.5 km), my blisters were bad enough to make me cry and call\
  \ home. By the time, I reached the walled city of Pamplona (65.5 km), I had to rely\
  \ on my suddenly inadequate Spanish to obtain antibiotics for an infection at an\
  \ emergency room.\n\nBut then again, lots of little moments were poignantly unforgettable.\
  \ Departing for Puente la Reina (92 km), I watched the sun rise on a field of crimson\
  \ poppies. In the tiny town of San Juan de Ortega, I wandered in a small moss-covered\
  \ church yard and listened to fellow walkers from Ireland tell beautiful stories\
  \ and sing around the fire. Walking into Burgos (261 km), I made the unfortunate\
  \ discovery that my careworn rain jacket was not actually waterproof, but I was\
  \ also utterly undone by the stunning Gothic cathedral that emerged in the downpour;\
  \ it was the first moment that I truly felt like I pilgrim, completely humbled.\
  \ In Le\xF3n (467.5 km), I remembered the vibrancy of being in a city and soaked\
  \ away the aches of my poor, downtrodden feet. With each day that went by I felt,\
  \ if not stronger, then at least more resilient to the hardships and the monotony\
  \ of the Camino. While I spent a lot of time walking alone, I had fallen in with\
  \ a group of fellow walkers from around the world. We might not stop at the same\
  \ refugio every night, but our paths would cross repeatedly on the trail, and the\
  \ vulnerability of sharing our stories with strangers bound us together.\n\nBy the\
  \ time I reached Sarria (661.5 km), it had been ghastly hot for several days in\
  \ a row. With end of the journey so close, I awoke as early as possible to finish\
  \ as much of the day\u2019s journey before the heat truly took hold. Up until the\
  \ moment that I fainted on the side of the trail from heat stroke, I told myself\
  \ that I was resting enough; that did not prevent the inevitability of a second\
  \ Spanish emergency room visit. I paused for several days, but it was clear that\
  \ my body was issuing a firm \u201Cno\u201D. Even short trips to the grocery store\
  \ left me feeling dizzy and winded. I was forced to face an unfathomable truth:\
  \ I might not finish my journey. After agonizing over my decision, I caught a bus\
  \ to reach my destination, Santiago de Compostela. When I arrived, my fellow walkers\
  \ looked at me with incredulity, as did the representative of the Pilgrims Office\
  \ who handled my pilgrim\u2019s passport (credencial). Aficionados of the Camino\
  \ will know that by not completing the last 100 km on foot, I was ineligible for\
  \ the coveted Compostela\u2014the official ecclesiastical certificate of completion.\n\
  \nEven with those pitying looks, I never regret my journey. We all move through\
  \ life at our own speed, our own pace, our own path. Where others needed to push\
  \ through, I needed to learn how to let go. To this day, I\u2019m reminded of some\
  \ of the first Camino graffiti I encountered: \nNo dejas que la prisa te robe el\
  \ coraz\xF3n. \nDon\u2019t let haste steal your heart."
