Text: "Journey of Dream\nTrekking to Everest Base Camp\nBy: Nurani Widaningsih\n\n\
  \tDecember 19, 2017, around eleven o'clock at night I arrived at Tribuvan International\
  \ Airport, Kathmandu and were immediately greeted by cold air at the airport, the\
  \ temperature printed was 15 degrees Celsius. I immediately looked for a taxi to\
  \ the hostel I ordered earlier, Trekkers Home in Thamel. My tiredness that day,\
  \ paid off by being able to rest at the hostel enjoying the cold that began to bite.\n\
  \tDecember 21, 2017 is the day I waited, and of course it was very stressful because\
  \ I would feel an extreme flight from Kathmandu to Lukla. The flight was only 45\
  \ minutes, but a thrilling sensation I couldn't hide. The flight between Himamaya's\
  \ group, swooped up and down, tilted to the left and right, no other activities\
  \ I did, all prayed. The view of the top of the snow mountain is indeed balanced\
  \ to pay for the tension of the flight that I feel.\n\tI arrived at Lukla with an\
  \ altitude of 2860 masl around one o'clock in the afternoon, and immediately continued\
  \ trekking to Phakding at a height. 2652 masl. In the morning I continued the journey\
  \ from Lukla past the Mondjo on and arrived at Namce Bazar at an altitude of 3,440\
  \ masl. The terrain that we traveled through was quite challenging, the steep and\
  \ uphill rock and cold air I had to fight. I arrived at Namche Bazzar at seven in\
  \ the evening.\n\tAlong the way I often bump into yak and nak, native Nepalese animals\
  \ that are used to carry things to the Lodge. Nepali people are very strong in lifting\
  \ burdens, so the majority of their livelihoods are as guides and porters, as well\
  \ as some as managers of lodge.\n\tAt Namhce Bazzar I had to acclimatize the temperature,\
  \ to avoid the symptoms of AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness) which often attacked trekkers\
  \ if they were already at a certain height. From the height of Everest View we can\
  \ see clearly the Himalayan clusters such as Ama Dablam Peak and other Himalayan\
  \ peaks, and of course the Everest Peak is truly challenging.\n\tThe next day, I\
  \ have to continue the journey to Tengboche to Debuche. Medan from Namche to Debuche\
  \ is extraordinarily physically challenging, I continue to see rocky slopes with\
  \ sloping slopes, vegetation has begun to decrease. The river or water source that\
  \ we encountered all froze into ice. Around 4 pm I made it to Debuche. My journey\
  \ continues to Pangboche and ends at Dingboche at an altitude of 4,430 masl.\n\t\
  In Dingboche I have to undergo acclimatization again, I stay overnight and tomorrow\
  \ it rises to a certain height. But we cannot continue, because suddenly I was hit\
  \ by wind and dust storms. Gravel flew and the wind was so strong. Every morning\
  \ I pray that God will continue to be strengthened, wrestling with bone-chilling\
  \ cold. I continued the journey from Dingboche, passed Tukla and arrived at Lobuche\
  \ at an altitude of 4,930 masl.\n\tArriving a day that I will not forget, December\
  \ 28, 2017, the morning I was ready to finish the trip. I prepared physically with\
  \ a lot of breakfast, then prayed together and continued the trip to Goraksheep\
  \ at an altitude of 5140 masl. I arrived at Goraksheep at around 12 noon, ate and\
  \ rested for a while until 1 pm, then I continued my journey to the last point,\
  \ Everest Base Camp. Around 3 pm we arrived at Everest Base Camp, our feelings of\
  \ emotion cannot be hidden. Lunglai my body, spilled tears and prostration thankfully\
  \ can finish the mandate to get to Everest Base Camp at an altitude of 5364 masl.\n\
  \tMount Everest, God's beautiful masterpiece, Roof top of the world which was originally\
  \ only a dream, but with His grace, God finally gave me the opportunity to be able\
  \ to reach Everest Base Camp, can climb up to a height of 5380 meters above sea\
  \ level. God strengthened my little footsteps which kept being dragged to reach\
  \ a dream and trust. Ambushed by longing and whining of the terrain, I could feel\
  \ how God was everything."
