Text: "I took the overnight bus to Oaxaca to escape the choke of a mountain ashtray.\
  \ I found myself at the bottom of Mexico City\u2019s valley with a broken heart,\
  \ and that pain put itself on loop, just as the haze on a polluted day is forced\
  \ inward by a mountain gale. I now find myself hundreds of kilometers south of the\
  \ city that initiated me into my travels. Though there are mountains here too, these\
  \ silhouettes fill me with a new kind of yearning. They call out to me; they don\u2019\
  t push me back.\n\nMy host, Alex, is a teacher at the local pueblo school. He teaches\
  \ biology and sciences, but will be tasked soon with the teaching of Zapotec, a\
  \ Mesoamerican language indigenous to this land and its people. \u2018Cloud people\u2019\
  \ - that\u2019s what they were called. It seems fitting as I admire the view from\
  \ my room, a structure built from wooden beam and corrugated metal at the top of\
  \ a spiraling tree. The stair running up the side of the trunk is precarious, but\
  \ only to somebody who has spent their life cushioned by formal building codes.\
  \ In the evening we walk through the historic Oaxaca City, in the shade of houses\
  \ with facades painted the colors of all the different roadside flowers. Alex picks\
  \ one of these flowers from a tree branch and offers me its scent, proudly saying,\
  \ \u201Cthese are what they use for Chanel Number Five!\u201D We run into one of\
  \ Alex's friends near the marketplace and he takes us to his garden, where homegrown\
  \ cacti and agave abound. He hands us two glasses of the thick milky beverage called\
  \ pulque, his own specialty. I appraise the drink in my hands. They say that Aztec\
  \ messengers would drink this to sustain them on long journeys across the arid country\
  \ by foot.\n\nThree weeks back: and I am at a Mexico City cocktail party where the\
  \ taste of pulque lingers heavily on my mouth. I remember the half-wrapped paintings\
  \ propped unhung against the wall, the dim glow of lights strewn lavishly around\
  \ the backyard.  Conversations flow with gusto. My shot glass is perpetually full.\
  \ But I look around and I only see white faces, worn conquistador ghosts on Friedeberg\
  \ chairs; a sense of discomfort rubs at me from inside. This is the city where avenues\
  \ take as their namesakes all of the great European cities and countries, so that\
  \ walking across neighborhoods one gets the sense that \u201CRoma\u201D and \u201C\
  Milan\u201D and \u201CBerlin\u201D convene at their intersections in an implosion\
  \ of something strange. Is it fascination? Obsession? Is it entitlement? Is this\
  \ the paradise or the inferno? Tucked between the pretty streets of La Condesa are\
  \ the gatherings where mezcal and tonic water and inter-family generations of uncle\
  \ and cousin and son all mix freely - and yet classism still pervades. At this moment\
  \ Pablo comes over to sit next to me. This is where he first kisses me. He has the\
  \ kind of face that looks like it could never do any wrong, but perhaps that was\
  \ my misjudgment.\n\nNow I am back in Oaxaca in the dust and the scalding touch\
  \ of its sun. Night comes and we gather at a neighborhood bar where beer is cheap\
  \ and a jukebox is present. Alex and his friends put on Luis Miguel - untouchable\
  \ in the eyes of Mexicans - and the room fills with the high-pitched voices of lovers\
  \ in a power ballad\u2019s trance. I look around me at these full and laughing faces.\
  \ I had come to the countryside to put a damper on a sting in my heart, to seek\
  \ out distractions. In its place was the shape of an inconceivable social illness,\
  \ something larger than me and than what I could hope to know. And yet these people\
  \ around me, taking care of me: they are happy. Singing! The morning before I leave\
  \ I take one last look at the landscape enveloping me: vast, rugged, nameless and\
  \ unforgettable. Amazing, I think, how much can be contained within a country, all\
  \ the happinesses and heartbreaks, rich and poor. I bite into my torta, which drips\
  \ in Oaxaca cheese, and watch the day turn into moonless night."
