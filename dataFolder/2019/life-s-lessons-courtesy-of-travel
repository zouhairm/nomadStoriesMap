Text: "As I pack my things to return home from my first solo adventure, I\u2019ve\
  \ been doing a lot of reflecting. Okay, I just cried in the shower, but still. Traveling\
  \ solo the past few weeks has taught me so many lessons that I am just finally beginning\
  \ to see. \nFor one, 99% of the time, other travelers are looking out for you. Yes,\
  \ there\u2019s always that nasty 1% who are out to hurt you or take advantage, but\
  \ most people you meet understand that we are all in the same boat. I\u2019ve met\
  \ so many people who have done simple things such as paying for me to do my laundry\
  \ when I didn\u2019t have the correct change. And others that have invited me to\
  \ share their bomb-ass villa with them for a night - just because it was their last\
  \ night in the city and they wanted to go out with a bang! The point is, everyone\
  \ you meet understands that you are on a journey, and our brief moments together\
  \ celebrate exactly that. \nWhich is something else I\u2019ve come to learn; you\
  \ will meet SO many amazing, life changing people and you may never see them again.\
  \ I think that is one of the hardest things for me to grasp. Although I do generally\
  \ try to embrace the Buddhist principal of impermanence, it\u2019s easier said than\
  \ done. There is something so poetic, so tragically beautiful about having a wonderful\
  \ day or couple of days, or, if you\u2019re lucky, couple of weeks, with other travelers\
  \ that you meet along the way. You exchange stories with one another, and create\
  \ new ones at the same time. More often than not, though, you never know it\u2019\
  s the last time that you\u2019ll see your traveling friend. I\u2019ve met amazing\
  \ people on the road that have  \u201Cflown home for Christmas\u201D or \u201Cwent\
  \ on a visa run\u201D only to find that their journey took them in a new and different\
  \ direction. There was no sadness, no goodbyes, only the beautiful time we spent\
  \ creating memories.\nNow I don\u2019t want to sugar coat it too much, there\u2019\
  s downsides to traveling, too. Like being alone over Christmas in a place that doesn\u2019\
  t celebrate it. There\u2019s missing food from back home, and then there is finding\
  \ amazing food that you know you\u2019ll NEVER get back home. There are language\
  \ barriers and new and strange traditions around every corner. But overall, my 8\
  \ week journey is concluding far too soon. This is only the beginning of the portal\
  \ into a new world, and I cannot wait to see what else is in store for me! The world\
  \ is begging to be explored...."
