Text: "- So, Caldo Verde is made of potatoes, collard greens and chorizo, it's very\
  \ tasty. \u2013 I explained, while going through the menu. \nAfter spending three\
  \ days in Hong Kong with her, I had to make sure she tries the best Portuguese food\
  \ in Macau. I met Jessica (her English name) in France, one year before my trip\
  \ to her native country. I had never before thought about visiting China or even\
  \ Hong Kong, but - there I was, together with her, having one of my best travel\
  \ experiences until then. \nLiving in Yueng Long, every day she has to travel at\
  \ least one hour by bus to reach her office on the 60th floor of one of the tallest\
  \ buildings of the city centre. Hong Kong is well known for its endless metropolis\
  \ rooftops, but the city offers a lot more to discover. I found it easy to get lost\
  \ in such beautiful peaks or mountains, bridges or simply looking at the sea and\
  \ admiring some of the more than two hundred islands. Their culture has a lot to\
  \ write about\u2026 Everyone has an English name, which they choose during the first\
  \ school years, for professional purposes. Then, they have a problem with the number\
  \ four! It is avoided almost everywhere: it means death and you can hardly find\
  \ a fourth floor or a house with that number. And another thing, did you know that\
  \ \u201C9up\u201D, frequently found on sweatshirts, actually means something like\
  \ bullsh*t? Yes, specifically in this metropolitan city, they really like to play\
  \ with words. An innocent nine up, as we could understand it in English, for them\
  \ has a completely different meaning, depending on the way they combine the characters.\
  \ Ah! Here is another curiosity, about the characters:  the Chinese symbols have\
  \ to be read from the top to the bottom, from the left to the right, and each one\
  \ has a different meaning, either on its own or when joined with more of them. My\
  \ name is made of four symbols, meaning: joyful, dew, water lily and delicate \u2013\
  \ can you take some conclusions about me by knowing this? \nAbout the food, well,\
  \ every meal was an adventure \u2013 Portuguese and Chinese gastronomy have nothing\
  \ to do with each other! Congee and fried dough was my first meal in Hong Kong and\
  \ I thought I had no chance using the chopsticks. Luckily I had the best teacher!\
  \ Udon, Dim Sum, all kind of noodles or even flat rice, always with the green tea\
  \ aside\u2026 by the end of the trip I was nearly professional. \nWhile I was having\
  \ the chance to get to know such a big city as Hong Kong with someone local, at\
  \ the same time I had the opportunity to show a little bit of my culture, too, and\
  \ at this point of our trip we switched. Macau is the place where our cultures come\
  \ together: it was a Portuguese colony for more than four hundred years and nowadays\
  \ it is mostly inhabited by the Chinese. In Taipa, just across the bridge from the\
  \ centre, there is still a lot that reminds of Portugal in every corner. The town\
  \ has approximately 6,5km2 and it\u2019s the most traditional place to visit. That\u2019\
  s where we had one of the best Caldo Verde I have ever tried, this time with knife\
  \ and fork. \nBy travelling the world I can live the culture, understand the custom,\
  \ accustom my palate, sense of smell and even my body, to all kinds of spices. It\u2019\
  s out there that I can meet other people as they are and learn to respect their\
  \ beliefs. Here\u2019s one thing that fascinates me the most: this sharing of ideas,\
  \ perspectives and worlds, listening to the other who, even if so different or from\
  \ another part of the globe, is just like me: someone trying to catch the opportunities\
  \ in life, letting go of what is not so important, learning to be grateful for each\
  \ day and making the most of life! When two cultures can be together in a place\
  \ where both of us feel at home, the moments turned into memories can be nothing\
  \ else but authentic."
