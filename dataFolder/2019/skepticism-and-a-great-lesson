Text: "It was already midnight when I arrived in Jakarta from Manila. It seemed quite\
  \ daunting travelling alone late at night, especially in a country that I was not\
  \ familiar with. Nevertheless, I was deeply ambivalent about my situation because\
  \ deep within, I had never felt so adventurous and independent than that day. \n\
  \nIt was 11th of October 2017 when I travelled for the first time to Indonesia for\
  \ a research presentation. I was terribly anxious because my colleague who had already\
  \ arrived a day ahead was not replying on his messenger, albeit it\u2019s not surprising\
  \ because it was already 1:00 in the morning. I needed to go to Margo Hotel in Depok,\
  \ the official conference accommodation, so I could also rest for at least few hours\
  \ before the conference. I had no choice but to take the risk and travel by taxi.\
  \ But first, I searched online for safety tips for traveling by taxi in Indonesia\
  \ and I became more distraught when I learned that Jakarta was among one of the\
  \ most dangerous cities in the world as per different blogs of some travelers who\
  \ had visited the country before. Nonetheless, most blogs recommended taking bluebird\
  \ taxis for their drivers would duly follow their taximeter.\n\nI had only few hours\
  \ left to take a rest, so I took the bluebird taxi. Luckily, the driver seemed friendly\
  \ and did try his best to speak with me despite the language barrier. To be honest,\
  \ it wasn\u2019t hard for me to feel comfortable, especially when he told me that\
  \ he liked Filipino people. He even shared some remarkable stories about how he\
  \ had become friends with many Filipinos working in their country. He apparently\
  \ made me feel at ease and in a way helped me expunge my worries.\n\nHowever, as\
  \ we were travelling, the streets became darker and darker. I became anxious again\
  \ as I remembered a blog that says, \u201Csome taxi drivers in Jakarta would bring\
  \ and drop you off to unfamiliar places.\u201D I was quivering due to the many negative\
  \ thoughts in my head. However, I tried to remain calm and showed the driver that\
  \ I was feisty. I calmly asked him where we were and how long it would take him\
  \ to bring me to the hotel. He responded in a reassuring manner and asked me to\
  \ trust him. I had no choice but to trust him. \n\nWe arrived at the hotel at around\
  \ 2:30 in the morning. I felt guilty because in spite of my apparent skeptical attitude,\
  \ the driver remained pleasant and gentle. I thanked and even hugged him for bringing\
  \ me safe to the hotel. I realized that I only focused on the negative comments\
  \ of some bloggers, thereby ignoring the many positive comments of other bloggers\
  \ about the country. Nevertheless, the experience was so unforgettable. It taught\
  \ me great lessons and helped me become more independent as a traveler."
