Text: "I could not believe it. \n\nThere were no words to describe the powerful emotions\
  \ that filled up inside of me as we walked down a slight hill towards the calm water\
  \ that languidly seeped back and forth across the sand. Aromatic hints of fresh\
  \ lemon lingered in the air and the mellow warmth of the setting European sun gently\
  \ brushed my skin as we paced around taking in the wondrous beauty of the scene\
  \ before us. We stared and I began to weep. The sun had only just gently touched\
  \ the horizon and it splashed our surroundings with such soft luminance and vivid\
  \ colours that I could not help but stand dumb-founded as we absorbed the paradise\
  \ we just arrived at. \n\nOur hotel sat comfortably in the middle of the hill. The\
  \ fading blue paint on the outer hotel wall looked cracked and peeled yet it added\
  \ an unexplainable sense of homeliness, perhaps an echo of some distant blissful\
  \ dream. In the distant I heard the faint strums of music from a cafe nearby, even\
  \ the choice of music appealed to my taste. I was in heaven. Then a beautiful thought\
  \ hit me. \n\nThat same night I left my friends to their enjoyments and pleasures\
  \ as I snuck away and ambled at a leisurely pace back towards our hotel. A content\
  \ smile formed on my lips when I thought about the night activity I had planned\
  \ that afternoon. I quickly grabbed my violin, which never left my side even when\
  \ travelling, and strapped it to my back as I made my way down towards the seaside.\
  \ \n\nThe coast of the town was small but I managed to find an obscure spot on a\
  \ large rocky boulder. I perched myself on top and began to play my favourite tunes.\
  \ Remembering the rich lushness of the acoustics brought goosebumps to my flesh\
  \ even though it was a warm August night. The street lamps were not bright but a\
  \ luminescent yellow that made me feel safe from the unwanted attention I might\
  \ receive. Protected by the semi- darkness, I felt bold enough to play at full volume.\
  \ It was a transcendental performance. With the vast unending sea, the petite boats,\
  \ the white washed yachts and the towering wall that marked the end of the coast\
  \ as my audience, I felt purity at its highest. \n\nI embraced the darkness and\
  \ solitude with open arms. I drew the music out note by note surrendering it into\
  \ the open sea and it wasn't until I had spent almost a half hour playing when I\
  \ realised that I had never felt closer to home. But it made no sense, I was the\
  \ furthest away from home I had ever been. Letting my violin rest for a while, I\
  \ set my back against the bumpy boulder and allowed my thoughts to unravel. Then\
  \ it suddenly struck me; I recognised this place, I recognised these sensations.\
  \ It was so familiar yet so foreign. My head furrowed in heated effort trying to\
  \ discover the mysterious lure of this landscape. \n\nDid I see this place in a\
  \ postcard? After a moment, I shook my head in exasperation. I did not even know\
  \ we were going to visit this part of the country in the first place so I ruled\
  \ out this thought. A film then. A book..? Yes! And there it was.  \n\nI remembered\
  \ being deeply attached to a children's illustrated book as a child, which is still\
  \ in my possession today. It was a large hardcover book that was a collection of\
  \ lullabies from all over the world and with each lullaby there was a picture that\
  \ accompanied it; 'Moondrops' the book was called. I detached myself from my thoughts\
  \ and absorbed the scene before me. Yes, this picturesque scene was an exact lookalike\
  \ of the picture that belonged with my favourite lullaby. Recalling the ripped,\
  \ yellowed and torn page patched up with sticky tape, a glowing warmth spread and\
  \ bloomed inside me. \n\nNever could I have imagined that a place could foster such\
  \ yearning and passionate love. And I never forgot that day I stumbled across Minori,\
  \ that little town off the Amalfi Coast."
