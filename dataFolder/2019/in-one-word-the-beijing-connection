Text: "China was my first trip in Asia, because living on the Asian side of Istanbul\
  \ for five years does not qualify as having visited Asia. Most importantly, it was\
  \ my first time in a country where I do not speak the language and where English\
  \ is of almost no help. \nMy journey started in Frankfurt where I had my connection\
  \ flight to Beijing. I arrived to the gate; 99% of the passengers were Chinese.\
  \ I giggled internally, starting to get excited about being fully immersed and eager\
  \ to see and feel. \nThey announced that the entertainment system was down so I\
  \ spent the ten-hour flight devouring my \u201CChinese for beginners\u201D phrasebook.\
  \ I arrived to Beijing with a few sentences up my sleeve, not without a certain\
  \ sense of pride. \nMy first evening in the old town was enchanting. Something in\
  \ the air reminded me of my beloved Damascus in its glorious days. The spotless\
  \ grey alleys of the Hutongs seemed like a perfect replica of an old city for a\
  \ movie set. It was pretty, but maybe too aseptic. It was nonetheless charming.\
  \ The profusely present color red was more than eye-catching; it was tantalizing.\
  \  \nIf Beijing were a color, it would definitely be red. With an almost unnoticeable\
  \ grey background. \nThe Yunnan cuisine dinner that followed, where the freshness\
  \ of mint leaves came to soothe the fire of chili peppers, was a delight to the\
  \ senses.\nThe next morning, just like a broken spell, I realized that I did not\
  \ remember anything from my ten-hour crash course in Chinese. I was subsequently\
  \ left with the words \u2018Hello\u2019 and \u2018Thank you\u2019, which I had learned\
  \ way before I opened that phrasebook on the plane. \nNevertheless, it did not prevent\
  \ me from indulging in wholesome massages and the most exquisite meals. I ordered\
  \ much more than I ate and as a result, I came to learn a very useful word in Chinese:\
  \ D\u0103b\u0101o (Meaning: to go) I systematically left every restaurant with a\
  \ doggy bag. I never learned. \nI loved every bite of every single thing I tried.\
  \ Well, except the famous (infamous to me now) Hot Pot. Suffice to mention the vision\
  \ of a tray coming my way with a rancid broth and yellow dead chicken feet. And\
  \ I thought smelling the putrid stinky tofu was the worst my nostrils would have\
  \ to endure. It said \u201Cchicken meat\u201D on the menu. It is ironic how a translation\
  \ software is equally able to save and ruin your life.\nThe inability to communicate\
  \ with people was my only source of frustration. They were kind, benevolent and\
  \ all smiles, but I could almost physically see the language barrier: the Great\
  \ Wall.  \nEye contact was my consolation though. People would look at me, with\
  \ a mix of curiosity and suspicion, and smile when I catch their eye, like a shy\
  \ secret admirer. I also felt like an attraction in the metros of Beijing as I blatantly\
  \ had my picture taken multiple times by complete strangers. Taken aback at first,\
  \ I ended up smiling to the cameras. I never felt more important. \nHowever, I kept\
  \ wondering if the language barrier was the only impediment to reaching out to Chinese\
  \ people, I wondered what they would say or not say had I spoken their language.\
  \ I oscillated between awe and apprehension. On one hand at how connected and monitored\
  \ they live, and on the other hand at how calm and tranquil they give the impression\
  \ to be. Do they live in fulfillment or constraint? Are they truly content or merely\
  \ resigned? Or maybe they have simply figured out the way to be in this world.\n\
  On my last day in Beijing, on my last metro ride, I was exchanging looks and smiles\
  \ with a family that had the most adorable baby (Fact: All Chinese babies are adorable)\
  \ And standing near the exit before my stop, right when the doors opened, I pronounced\
  \ the only word I learned in China, with the accompanying gesture while pointing\
  \ at the baby: \u201CD\u0103b\u0101o?\u201D \nHad I just asked them if I could take\
  \ their baby \u2018to go\u2019? Yes I had. Followed the most genuine of laughter.\
  \ There it was! The connection."
