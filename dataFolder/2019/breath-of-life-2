Text: "I sought out to find a gift and I received one greater than I could ever imagine.\
  \ \n\nI was alone. Eventually, my only company became the moon, stars and the piercing,\
  \ polar air that filled my lungs. My mission that evening was to clear my mind,\
  \ to reflect on my blessings and to take a moment to be thankful for everything\
  \ I had been gifted so far in life. A celebration of my birthday. This one unlike\
  \ any others. I was alone, but I wasn\u2019t lonely. I had nature all around me.\
  \ \n\nSightings of the northern lights, the dancing lady, Aurora Borealis, had been\
  \ reported days prior to my arrival and so I headed out just before sunset, in hopes\
  \ that by some manifestation of mystical power, the dancing lady would perform for\
  \ me. \n\nNorthern Norway is mild in early September. During the day, the sun outwits\
  \ oblivious tourists into wearing short sleeves and sandals, unaware that once this\
  \ source of heat disappears below the horizon, the arctic air gives way.  With three\
  \ layers of clothes on, I was prepared for anything. I knew I\u2019d be out for\
  \ at least several hours and was not willing to spend any of my energy on worrying\
  \ about whether or not I was getting frostbite.\n\nThe sunset was magical. The sky\
  \ turned into a colourful palette of pinks and reds. Scattered clouds. If Aurora\
  \ was to perform, her stage had been set just right. Twilight came, dusk followed,\
  \ swallowing any remaining bit of warmth.\n\nThat's when I felt it first. An unfamiliar,\
  \ almost unnerving cold wind. The cold here wasn't like the cold at home, I couldn't\
  \ really make sense of it. It's just temperature. How can it make me feel \nlike\
  \ a whole new person? Like it was the first breath I had taken in years? Like the\
  \ air I was breathing up to that specific moment was just an imposter, tricking\
  \ me into thinking I was getting the real thing?\n\nI walked and I breathed. Paying\
  \ close attention to everything that this drug-like air made me feel. My face was\
  \ numb. My heartbeat was slow and steady. My mind was racing with thoughts while\
  \ also being completely at peace. I passed a person who was running. Maybe I should\
  \ start running too? Increase my respirations so I can gulp down as much of this\
  \ air as physically possible. \n\nI walked far enough for the lights emitting from\
  \ the town to be invisible and took my front-row seat to a dance performance I was\
  \ uncertain would happen on a cold, wooden bench overlooking a lake with a mountain\
  \ backdrop. \n\nA light emerged from behind the mountain directly in front of me.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t sure if it was the beginning of the night\u2019s dance performance\
  \ or something completely different. Lady Aurora, however, must have, and rightly\
  \ so, gotten a dose of stage fright that night, she was probably intimidated by\
  \ the main performer, who was also unexpected to me. The moon made an appearance\
  \ by rising out from behind mountains, illuminating the lake below it. As it rose\
  \ above me, I felt entranced. Just me, the moon, the stars and the air. A show I\
  \ could never forget.\n\nThat night I had found something I was not expecting to\
  \ find. A gift by chance. The gift of passion and of fuel. Air which I crave to\
  \ this day and make it my mission to search for. Air, which on days when I\u2019\
  m uninspired and unmotivated, reminds me that there is a reason to keep going, because\
  \ one day, I know that I will be able to breathe it again."
