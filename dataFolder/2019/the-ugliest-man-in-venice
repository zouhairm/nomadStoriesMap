Text: "I hadn\u2019t really done any travelling but I had visited some countries with\
  \ a band called Mojo Gogo. We played shows in Toronto, Spain, Germany and Holland.\
  \ But these trips were just drink fuelled days of hazy gigs and madness. We made\
  \ some good friends and also left some people with poor opinions of us due to our\
  \ antics. One story springing to mind was of a festival we were playing in Bunde,\
  \ Germany. We were given laniards, stating that we were \u2018the band\u2019. We\
  \ had a one kilometre stretch of bars and food vendors, of which all was free to\
  \ us.  We ended up very drunk. We found ourselves in a bar, that was fairly quiet\
  \ except for a party of ten people. Keelin, our bass player was at the bar getting\
  \ a round in, when a young German man asked him if he was in the band and would\
  \ like to buy him a drink.\n\u2018Sure. What do you want?\u2019\n\u2018what are\
  \ you drinking?\u2019\n\u2018double vodka and red bull\u2019\n\u2018me too.\u2019\
  \nDrink was put on bar and the young man drank the drink in one gulp. Keelin ordered\
  \ the same again. Man drank double vodka and red bull again in one, impressing Keelin.\
  \ The guy must have drank 10 vodkas in 5 minutes, to our delight as we always loved\
  \ a mad one. Then an older woman appeared at the young mans shoulder and they got\
  \ into a heated argument in German. She turned to us and began her tirade. The young\
  \ man was part of a group that was out to watch the music. She was the carer. The\
  \ group consisted of people with severe autism and Aspergers. We were asked to leave\
  \ the bar.\n\nSo this was my first trip away on my own. 2 weeks in LA and 1 week\
  \ in San Francisco. Frisco gave me a mind horn as I couldn\u2019t wait to get in\
  \ around Vesuvios, City lights bookstore and North Beach. Get a feel for where the\
  \ beats and Hunter S.Thompson frequented.\nI spent the first 2 weeks lying around\
  \ Venice Beach, drinking in shore front bars, people watching and reading. It may\
  \ have not been a \u2018culture shock\u2019, but to be in foreign land alone was\
  \ risky enough to me and felt like a sense of achievement. One day I rented a bmx\
  \ and cycled from Venice to Santa Monica. I was approached by a black man of maybe\
  \ late 30\u2019s whilst waiting on a light to change at a pedestrian crossing. It\
  \ was 32 degree heat and he was wearing a black t-shirt that had white crusted patches\
  \ where the salt from his sweat had dried in his t-shirt and he was barefooted.\n\
  \u2018Hey man\u2026welcome to the land of fruits and nuts. Could you buy a brother\
  \ a coffee?\u2019\n\u2018Sure. What kind?\u2019\n\u2018Could I press you for a vanilla\
  \ bean frappuccino?\u2019\nI was taken aback. Bums in Santa Monica sure had good\
  \ taste in coffee. When I ordered the drink the man behind the counter questioned\
  \ me.. \u2018are you Australian?\u2019\n\u2018No scottish\u2019\n\u2018Ah..all you\
  \ European guys sound the same to me\u2019.\n\u2018As do all you Canadians to me.\u2019\
  \nI handed the drink to the gent and headed on my merry way. 3 old fashioned\u2019\
  s in me, I had that drink glow and didn\u2019t feel anxious.\nUpon cycling back\
  \ to Venice beach, I stopped to watch a lady play a baby grand piano just shy of\
  \ the skate park as the sun was setting through the palm trees amongst a mix of\
  \ blues, purples and orange. To the right of the lady playing, there was another\
  \ black man raiding a trash can. I felt a pang of guilt. What with me having a full\
  \ stomach and drunk on premium cocktails. Then the man started to break the bread\
  \ up and scatter it for the gulls and pigeons. Amongst all these beautiful people\
  \ and the bums who were handsome, I was the ugliest man in Venice. I couldn\u2019\
  t have been happier to witness this act of kindness, restoring my faith in a selfish\
  \ species, from a man who had nothing, to share with the birds."
