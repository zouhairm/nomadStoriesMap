Text: I am a student at univercity in faculty of computer science when i studied at
  school it was my ambition that be a creative writer sometimes i wrote about my life,
  my education and about my ability .... in my notebook my friends saied that a i
  can be a good writer ....... Well, i studied hard untill i could go to university
  but it was not my favorite faculty but now i like it it' s a knowladge and also
  a skill we are humen and it' s our nessecity that we should know about the world,
  technology and more   as i saied i study at univercity and i study  hard i believe
  that if we try we can do it . i love traveling i also writing i believe that i can
  be a good writer  . sometimes when i am free i write about  my life, future, my
  education ,my favorite car ,job....... there is a story by the name of the poor
  girl it is an interesting story about a girl that has alot of uncomplete ambitions
  and these days i write the continue of this story ....   Let's talk about traveling
  i believe that we should visit different countries and meet different people and
  travel to around the world and enjoy it  because we have one chance for living in
  this world it was my idea....it was a short note about my self........... Thanks
