Text: "\u201CTwelve seconds. That\u2019s how long we\u2019ve got to decide if we shoot\
  \ the animal or not.\u201D\n\nIt is just past six o\u2019clock on a brisk South\
  \ African morning. Half an hour from Skukuza Rest Camp, our group of seven huddle\
  \ around Pilot, our field guide, as he prepares us for the sunrise safari walk ahead.\n\
  \n\u201CAnd how many times have you had to shoot an animal?\u201D asks one of the\
  \ tourists, her eyes wide.\n\nPilot laughs.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s not a question\
  \ to ask before we leave.\u201D\n\nPilot and his colleague, Lettuce, equip themselves\
  \ with their rifles, slinging belts of ammunition around their torsos. Then, in\
  \ a single line, we follow the field guides through the untamed bush, navigating\
  \ dirt paths Pilot tells us have been made by constant animal traffic. Our surroundings\
  \ are dimly lit, the July sun\u2019s timid rays teasing us beyond the horizon.\n\
  \nWe\u2019ve been instructed to walk in complete silence so as not to frighten potential\
  \ game sightings. As our four-wheel drive fades in the distance, the sounds of the\
  \ road are replaced by the distinct crunch of gravel below booted feet, the rustle\
  \ of dry grass and the high-pitched swipe of khaki on khaki.\n\nSuddenly, Pilot\
  \ points to something on the ground, halting us in our tracks. He says just one\
  \ word:\n\n\u201CLion.\u201D\n\nHis outreached finger traces the outline of a paw\
  \ in the air as, simultaneously, our eyes distinguish the shape in the dirt below.\
  \ He briefly consults with Lettuce to establish the direction the lion is heading\
  \ before we fall into single file once more; this time, with purpose.\n\nIt only\
  \ takes minutes of walking before our first on-foot encounter. Upon hearing our\
  \ approach, a group of impalas lifts their heads, warily, and gaze at us from a\
  \ distance. Then, without warning, they begin to gallop, their steady gait interspersed\
  \ with spritely bounces that reach impressive heights. As their husky warning calls\
  \ crescendo then fade, our eyes, glistening with anticipation, wander to find the\
  \ cause of the sudden panic, but find nothing in the thick greenery.\n\nWe are the\
  \ predator.\n\n\u201CEnemy number one,\u201D says Pilot. \u201CWhen you\u2019re\
  \ in your car, the animals think nothing of you, but as soon as you\u2019re on foot,\
  \ you become the predator and they, your prey.\u201D\n\nWe stop intermittently for\
  \ our guides to explain the natural wonders left behind by our furry, feathered\
  \ and scaled counterparts. We handle antelope horns, a string of decaying meat still\
  \ attached; we carefully tiptoe among the scattered carcass of a giraffe; we examine\
  \ the harrowing grin of a rhino\u2019s skull. With almost a quarter of a century\
  \ of experience between them, Pilot and Lettuce\u2019s wealth of knowledge and the\
  \ facts they impart impress us all. \n\nMoments after we begin our trek back to\
  \ the vehicle - just as I\u2019ve accepted we won\u2019t see any other two- or four-legged\
  \ creatures - Pilot ushers our dispersed line into a small cluster with some urgency.\n\
  \n\u201CThere! There! Can you see it?\u201D\n\nHis voice is a stage whisper.\n\n\
  We follow where his finger is pointing into the terrain. Soon, my eyes discern the\
  \ slinking tan rump of a lion. A football field away, the big cat has clearly seen\
  \ us before we have seen him. Yet, his retreat is calm and steady.\n\nConsidering\
  \ our usual mode of transport, it is refreshing to explore the land by foot. Our\
  \ experience with the \u201Cking of the jungle\u201D is possibly more breathtaking\
  \ than an elephant mere metres from the car. Perhaps it is the lack of any barriers\
  \ or the sense of vulnerability or maybe it is the thrill of breaking the usually\
  \ enforced rules.\n\nWith the lion now amid the farthest trees, we return our attention\
  \ to the journey ahead.\n\n\u201CWhich way?\u201D asks Pilot, feigning concern.\n\
  \nIn due time, courtesy of the navigation skills of our guides, we find our four-wheel\
  \ drive parked haphazardly on the edge of the tar. Back in the comfort of the vehicle,\
  \ I face Pilot expectantly:\n\n\u201CSo, how many times have you had to shoot an\
  \ animal?\u201D \n\n\u201CNever.\u201D"
