  \ of this beautiful country and throughout the country spas provide authentic treatments\
  \ if it is in a 5 star resort or a beach side hut. Thailand holidays provides you\
  \ the best sightseeing, variegated shopping, colorful history, and gourmet. \n\n\
  Thailand has an outstanding beauty like the\nChief northern cities, such as Khon\
  \ Khen and Chiang Mai. Thailand is full of fun and colors and it is an outstanding\
  \ destination to visit. Thailand holiday packages never fails for attracting and\
  \ amazing citizens of different age groups. Nonetheless, there are a number of stunning\
  \ towns, shoreline and isles as well, and the hospitality they extend is beyond\
  \ our imagination and it makes this city a famous place with travelers. \n\nBangkok\
  \ the Capital city of Thailand, is on the edge of river named Chao Phraya. It is\
  \ the largest city in the entire country with almost 7,000,000 population. \n\n\
  An worldwide well-known seashore resort named Pattaya is positioned almost 170 km\
  \ south of Bangkok. Pattaya is premier beach resort of Thailand and annually fascinates\
  \ happiness seeking people from all across the world. Comfortable tropical ambience\
  \ of Pattaya is the ideal for an unforgettable holiday experience for couples, singles\
  \ and families too. Pattaya beach really touches the shoreline in a four km long\
  \ arc. Southern beach is famous for its best night time activities. Streets are\
  \ alive to crowd and bustle of entertainment halls, restaurants as well as crowded\
  \ bars. Northern beach is sedate enough and best for Pattaya.\n\n It is a beautiful\
  \ country with many things to see and do, and paired with a unique culture, It is\
  \ a place more than worthy of exploration. \n\nTo begin, one very good reason to\
  \ go to Thailand is because of how different it is from other countries, especially\
  \ those in the Western Hemisphere. Thailand is renowned in the world over as a beautiful\
  \ country.\n\nThailand emerged as a key location due to its strengths in matured\
  \ infrastructure, IT, and communication systems. The Thai government is very friendly\
  \ to foreign travellers. The easiest way to save money in Thailand is to live like\
  \ a local. take the local buses, eat street food instead of standard restaurant\
  \ food, and drink beer instead of other (more expensive) alcohol. In Bangkok, the\
  \ average Thai citizens live on a less than 8,000 THB per month. In the countryside,\
  \ the average person lives on even less. Try to follow their example. Visit less\
  \ touristy cities and islands, and you\u2019ll save big.\n\nThailand is my most\
  \ favourite travel destination,  and I would like to recommend  this to all my friends\
  \ and Relatives.  \n\nFinally,  Thailand,  being popularly referred to as the Land\
  \ of smiles, with extremely warm hearted and affectionate people all over the Country,\
  \  you are bound to come back with a smiling face, after completing your most cherished\
  \ vacation of all time may be.\n\nThailand,  I Love You."
