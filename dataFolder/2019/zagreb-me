Text: "I follow the tramlines into a haze of blue fog, shot with neon light. Just\
  \ beyond is a sunlit hill, bristling with church spires. \n\nI\u2019m hoping to\
  \ get to the top before dark.\n\nThe street is narrow and flanked with gloomy walls\
  \ layered with the tattered remnants of posters. Below is bumpy bitumen. I walk\
  \ with eyes downcast to avoid tripping. \n\nA woman emerges from an alleyway, wheeling\
  \ a bicycle, the rear weighed down with a bundle of kindling. She hops onto the\
  \ seat and takes off with a grunt and clatter of chain. \n\nI run a gloved hand\
  \ along a hedge and tweak the foliage. Raising my fingertips to my nostrils, I inhale\
  \ the sharp tang of rosemary followed by the base note of leather. \n\nThere\u2019\
  s a blast of chill wind and my nose and cheeks sting. A paper bag, still holding\
  \ the bottle\u2019s shape, pirouettes, mid-air. \n\nA man with stooped shoulders\
  \ approaches and opens his lips as if to toss me a friendly greeting. But on a second\
  \ look, he swallows his words, and climbs concave steps with a heavy tread to disappear\
  \ into a doorway.\n\nOnce again, without having opened my mouth, I\u2019ve been\
  \ identified as a non-Croatian speaker. What it is about me that gives me away?\
  \ My face, my skin, my bearing, my gait? It can\u2019t be my clothes as I purchased\
  \ them from a secondhand shop, here in the city.\n\nThe street widens and begins\
  \ to sparkle with shop windows displaying zlato, gold, and srebro, silver jewellery,\
  \ with many of the pieces are fashioned into acorn shapes, the traditional Croatian\
  \ symbol for prosperity. The air becomes filled with the warm fragrance of burek,\
  \ pastries filled with spiced meat, from a hole-in-the-wall bakery somewhere, nearby.\n\
  \nI pause to window-shop and a kitten the colour of smoke swirls around my ankles.\
  \ From my pocket, I pull out a handful of \u010Dvarci, crispy pork rind, and place\
  \ it on the ground. The kitten gobbles up every chunk; even licking up the crumbs\
  \ with a minuscule tongue. I stroke its spine and jutting ribs shudder with purrs.\n\
  \nI resume walking and the kitten crouches down low, eyes green beacons against\
  \ the grey of concrete.\n\nWhen I look back a few seconds later, the kitten is gone.\n\
  \nA solitary man sits outside a restoran, scanning the menu in the crimson glow\
  \ of wall-mounted heaters, while sipping from a glass of dusky beer. I dawdle, hoping\
  \ to catch his eye, maybe even a smile \u2014 after weeks of solo travel, I\u2019\
  d love to eat a meal with someone on the other side of the table. But his head swings\
  \ round at the sound of stiletto heels striking cobblestones, and I pass by, unnoticed,\
  \ unseen.\n\nI reach the top of the hill. The sun is still shining and church bells\
  \ are reverberating in my ears. I turn up the collar of my coat, the wool snug against\
  \ my chin, and retrieve a bottle of blood-warmed honey rakija, brandy, from my pocket.\n\
  \nI take a long swallow. A fire dragon roars down my throat and curls up in my belly.\n\
  \nI watch an old man is feeding pigeons, his feet anchored to the earth, body bent\
  \ to the shape of the wind. \n\nI take another swallow. The fire dragon snarls.\
  \ \n\nI become weightless. A disembodied, voiceless spirit.\n\nThe pigeons spin\
  \ high into the sky, wing feathers radiant and gold-tipped in the falling sun.\n\
  \nAnd when their shadows pass through mine, I feel like I\u2019m taking flight."
