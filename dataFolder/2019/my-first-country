Text: "This is my first traveling experience, I had the opportunity to visit the country\
  \ where my boyfriend came from, thousands of miles away from where I live. For the\
  \ first time I felt the difficulty of struggling to arrange a visa and various traveling\
  \ equipment. It all started with my plan to visit my boyfriend and his family, we\
  \ planned to spend the Christmas holiday together. \nI came in mid-December, landed\
  \ safely in Amsterdam after going through a delayed struggle for 2 hours in Kuala\
  \ Lumpur. I arrived in December during the winter, hoping to meet snow for the first\
  \ time, but it looks like this year's Christmas in Netherlands is Christmas without\
  \ snow, too bad.\nI am a Muslim with hijab, first visiting Europe, the thing I worry\
  \ about is how people will look at me. When dealing with immigration it feels a\
  \ little scary but not as I imagined, in the end everything goes smoothly, they\
  \ just ask how long I will stay and what I will do in the Netherlands.\nThe gray\
  \ sky of Amsterdam welcomed me when it first arrived, rain and storm and cold temperatures\
  \ made me want to immediately find coffee. At Schiphol Airport Amsterdam it's very\
  \ easy to get everything you need. Around the airport there are super market that\
  \ sell everything and the price is not too expensive, they even sell bus and train\
  \ tickets. This airport has an underground train station that makes it easy for\
  \ you to travel anywhere. My first impression while visiting was that everything\
  \ was very organized.\nIn the Netherlands there are many beautiful cities that you\
  \ can visit, traveling in this country by public transportation is a very appropriate\
  \ choice, besides being cheaper, it is also very time efficient. This country which\
  \ is famous for its windmills and canals is very interesting to explore. Maybe the\
  \ only reason I'm going to the Netherlands is to meet my lover, but I really enjoy\
  \ my time here. \nThere is a restaurant that I visited when I was here, Kop Van\
  \ De Haven, a restaurant located around the port in the area of Velsen, a best fish\
  \ and view in town, you enter and you imagine yourself on a ship. You can see the\
  \ sea water all around you. Every detail makes you experience and taste the raw,\
  \ maritime beauty of Ijmuiden, all day long. You can tell by the dishes, the interior\
  \ and the presentation. A very memorable place for me.\nThere are many very beautiful\
  \ places in this country, maybe Amsterdam is sounds familiar to you, beautiful city\
  \ but very busy, but there are still many old cities in the Netherlands that you\
  \ can visit with their respective charms. Maybe Leiden, or Harlem or other cities,\
  \ many beautiful places that you can visit here. I will write a more interesting\
  \ story when I return to the Netherlands, maybe this time about the beautiful flowers\
  \ that bloom in March."
