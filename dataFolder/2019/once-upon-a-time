Text: "\u201CArt washes the soul from the dust of Everyday Life\u201D\n\nMany people\
  \ think that its one\u2019s inbuilt nature to love and see art since they were a\
  \ child, but for me it was my escape to my own little world of imagination. It all\
  \ Started when I was extremely young i never really thought I would be the Best\
  \ Artist in the class or Be the one to have the Highest Grades in the subject of\
  \ Art. I used Art as an expression, something that would come right out of my heart,\
  \ a concept, a visual, a dream as one would think. I never thought of leading my\
  \ path to the world of creation but to simply leave my boring life to create something\
  \ and make myself happy. Yet as I grew up I tended to fall out on my skills as i\
  \ was merely affected by what the world thought of me, I wanted to be what others\
  \ wanted and, in my eyes, I wasn\u2019t even close to the idea of being the best,\
  \ I became lonely and depressed. During this time, my mental health took an Extreme\
  \ Low end and started to affect my life in terms of my grades in school and college.\
  \ I Stopped Believing that I could create anything that would satisfy others. Yet\
  \ when there is a low there is only one way to grow up. I took an effort to go and\
  \ explore what the world has and what we perceive as art. Lucky for me a trip to\
  \ Europe was planned in Late November 2014, this trip opened my eyes to the beautiful\
  \ City of Paris. Everything I saw there was an imagination of what beauty would\
  \ look like in form of a city. It was a marvelous experience to be to a place where\
  \ the streets, the parks, the shops and even the restaurants represented art. It\
  \ was only then that I Visited the Louvre, it was a blessing for me to go see the\
  \ work of Leonardo Da Vinci in his most priced position the Lisa Del Giaconda (The\
  \ Mona Lisa) I couldn\u2019t help myself but to wonder the simplicity of her smile;\
  \ A smile that barely exists, a certain glow, a certain happiness exposed through\
  \ her face that portrayed of how amazing an artist Leonardo Da Vinci was, that he\
  \ could make a simple woman look so astonishing. I have never been to a place where\
  \ I was covered by thoughts and ideas and amazing painting by several artists. The\
  \ Young Martyr by Delaroche was again one of my favorites in the museum de Louvre.\
  \ He symbolized the fatal death of his wife through a painting and for me a true\
  \ artist is one who can communicate feelings and emotions in such highs that the\
  \ viewer can also relate and become part of what the artist is willing to show us.\
  \ These Painting evoked the responses and feelings in me which is why I tried to\
  \ decipher the hidden meanings behind those paintings while just taking a long glimpse\
  \ at them. For me all the arts there whether they were the sculptures, painting,\
  \ drawing or even the beautiful architecture surrounding me was made with intense\
  \ symbolism in terms of portrayal and exquisite techniques used to make them. It\
  \ was an unforgettable moment for me. Seeing how art created such an impact on the\
  \ viewer I only pondered on one thought that day and that thought being \u201CThis\
  \ is how I want my films to be open enough for the audience to assume but personal\
  \ enough to have their own messages\u201D. I saw that ever since art took a part\
  \ in our lives as humans is when we truly become Story Tellers. As Every Art whether\
  \ it is a Painting or a Film symbolizes a piece of information about yourself or\
  \ your surroundings that nobody else knew. Since then I recognized myself; I wanted\
  \ to become one of them! Someone to be remembered, someone who knew the roots of\
  \ her medium & someone who understood the world. I would love to take up on this\
  \ opportunity as it would be the stepping stone I would love to experience."
