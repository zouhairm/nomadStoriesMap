Text: "What started out as a casual stroll through immigration and customs developed\
  \ into a rather bizarre exchange of futile explanations and a somewhat embarrassing\
  \ game of charades. \nMy wife and I had just arrived in India and would be spending\
  \ nearly a month exploring this intriguing country from the southern jungles to\
  \ the houseboats of Srinagar.  Excitedly, we entered the airport custom lines designated\
  \ for each of us:  one for women, the other for men.  \nIt was a blistering hot\
  \ and humid June day in what was later catalogued as the hottest summer in 40 years\
  \ on the Indian subcontinent, and the throngs of people invading our personal space\
  \ were pressing against us with warm, sweaty bodies, the pungent smell of spices\
  \ exuding from their pores.  We each had a carry-on as we were herded into our respective\
  \ lines. With patience and a smile, I approached the waiting examiner without trepidation\
  \ because I had nothing to hide.\n\u201CHow much time will you be spending in India?\u201D\
  \ he asked as he glanced through the pages of my passport.\n\u201CThree to four\
  \ weeks,\u201D I responded.\n\u201CAnd do you have anything to declare?\u201D came\
  \ his query as he looked me in the eyes.\n\u201CNo, nothing,\u201D I confidently\
  \ replied.\n\u201CYou smoke?\u201D he asked.\n\u201CNo,\u201D I responded.\n\u201C\
  Well, sir, are you certain of that?\u201D was his comeback.\n\u201CYes, I\u2019\
  m positive,\u201D I answered.\n\u201CWhy, then, are you transporting dozens of cigars\
  \ if you claim not to smoke?  Certainly you smoke or you would not be in possession\
  \ of so many cigars, would you, sir?\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, but you must have\
  \ me mistaken for someone else.  I don\u2019t smoke.\u201D  Consternation must have\
  \ been apparent on my face as well as a touch of irritation in my voice, already\
  \ noticeably changing as adrenaline started flowing through me.\n\u201COne moment,\
  \ please,\u201D the examiner replied.  He turned and beckoned to several stern-looking\
  \ uniformed men, who approached our station.  \u201CAgain, sir, do you still deny\
  \ transporting cigars?\u201D he asked as the others glared at me.\nWithout hesitating,\
  \ I repeated everything I had earlier stated. When finished, I was promptly asked\
  \ what color my carry-on luggage was.  I stated that it was a green bag.  Immediately\
  \ my bag appeared out of nowhere and was placed on the table. One of the officials\
  \ disengaged the buckle and opened the bag for all to inspect.  For a few moments\
  \ there was a flurry of activity and whispering as the bevy of uniformed men scrutinized\
  \ the contents of my carry-on.\n\u201CAha, we were right!  You do smoke cigars and\
  \ are guilty of smuggling them into India and lying to officials!\u201D one of the\
  \ more serious-looking men exclaimed.\nStill confused, I asked: \u201CWhere are\
  \ all these cigars that I am supposedly smuggling into India?\u201D knowing full\
  \ well that there were no cigars in my possession.\n\u201CIf you are not transporting\
  \ cigars, sir, then what exactly are these?\u201D the most formidable of the officials\
  \ asked in his accusatory voice as he pulled out several cigars and thrust them\
  \ indignantly into the air to expose me.\nSo stunned was I that, at first, I could\
  \ barely respond.  Then, in the calmest voice, wanting to burst out in laughter,\
  \ though I dared not, I answered, \u201CThose are tampons, not cigars.\u201D  Apparently,\
  \ not one of the men knew what tampons were because they all looked confused when\
  \ I opened one of the little packages to reveal an object that was definitely not\
  \ a cigar.  I tried to explain to them, myself a bit embarrassed, what a tampon\
  \ was, but they still did not appear to understand.  So I was left with my cocktail\
  \ party skills to save me.  I hoisted up one leg onto the table, told the officials\
  \ to imagine me being a woman, and pretended to insert a tampon between my legs.\
  \ Surely they would comprehend, but even that effort was futile.\nIn the end, I\
  \ was saved further time and embarrassment as a female official was finally summoned\
  \ to our station and, in a very low voice, she herself embarrassed, explained to\
  \ all the men exactly what was in my suitcase.  Never again have I inadvertently\
  \ taken my wife\u2019s carry-on through customs, and I still don\u2019t smoke."
