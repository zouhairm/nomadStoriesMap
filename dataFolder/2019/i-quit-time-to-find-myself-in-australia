Text: "It happens that one day you look around and everything seems too tight. The\
  \ same street to go to work, the same old friends at the bar, a mattress a bit uncomfortable\
  \ that you never decide to change. You switch on the laptop, read stories of lands\
  \ that seems so far, cradled by the ocean, that is screaming your name. And then\
  \ that friend, who posted photos of him surfing, working in that bar with plants\
  \ on the walls or in the middle of the Outback with a kangaroo in the background,\
  \ and a question begins to rise in your head: what if moving to Australia is not\
  \ that impossible? If it is not such an insane idea?\nA backpack, an hostel booked\
  \ for a few nights and a huge need to leave and be free. These are the traits that\
  \ the backpackers have in common, mythological individuals who stop cutting their\
  \ hair or worry about the make-up and leave, with some crumpled clothes,  towards\
  \ the other hemisphere.\n\nWhen all of this thoughts and needs started to make me\
  \ want to be brave and leave home, I decided that Australia would have been the\
  \ place. And then, it become my place: I could feel  home even if miles and miles\
  \ away. \nI chose Sydney, with its Opera House and its Harbor Bridge, photographed\
  \ by millions of tourists. I chose to move to Australia in October, when the summer,\
  \ timidly, was ready to explode. I found a job, that became much more, as an AuPair,\
  \ to immerse myself in the culture of the island, living a stone's throw from the\
  \ beach. I left knowing that I would spend Christmas upside down: on the other side\
  \ of the world, where the waves are higher, the clouds are farthest and the air,\
  \ happier. Among barefoot boys, with a surfboard under their arms slaloming between\
  \ bizarre characters dressed as Santa Claus who, sweating, asked for two coins and\
  \ dreamed of being away, maybe where it snows on Christmas.\nI wanted a new beginning,\
  \ looking for safe house in the other hemisphere, while at home the air was stinging\
  \ and the snow covered the garden of the house. \nI could no longer content myself,\
  \ everything had become too small. And so, I decided to chase the world that was\
  \ moving on without me. \nI met Sheyla, who came from Canada, Elisabeth, from England,\
  \ Irina, from Holland. Jackson from America, Tom from Melbourne, Stella from Italy.\
  \ With each of them I shared a piece of my adventure, whole weekends scattered in\
  \ some forest, traveling to other cities, the New Year with fireworks.\n\nAnd now\
  \ that I'm back home, I advise anyone to put aside \"ifs\" and \"buts\". To save\
  \ money for the Visa and the courage to leave \"home\" for a while. The \"how to\
  \ move to Australia\" will come by itself."
