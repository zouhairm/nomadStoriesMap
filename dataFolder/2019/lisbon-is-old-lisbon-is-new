Text: "Forty-eight hours after a flight that lasted twelve, I was less grouchy, and\
  \ I got used to the new time zone. In fact, to start the trip in the most immediate\
  \ way possible, I was guided by cousin, the person that I know to be the most passionate\
  \ of Lisbon, his native land and the place he decided to love more than any other\
  \ in the world. Knowing that he would lead me on a day's journey to the geographical\
  \ highs and lows of Fernando Pessoa\u2019s land, I put on sneakers and a scarf to\
  \ face the steep slopes and slicing winds of the capital.\nAccording to the programming\
  \ that he himself had prepared and held at his fingertips, we followed his rigorous\
  \ script that began at Pra\xE7a do Com\xE9rcio and advanced through Baixo Chiado\
  \ and Alfama. It was the first time I had physically visited Lisbon;  I could feel\
  \ under my feet the unevenness of the stones on the sidewalk, I was trying to understand\
  \ this city that I had already known from the long reports of my maternal grandmother,\
  \ who had lived until her thirteenth birthday in one of the villages that composed\
  \ what we know today from the perimeter of that urban area, quite different from\
  \ what my predecessor had lived among the sheep she herself shepherded. I understood\
  \ that my cousin, mentioning my grandmother several times, tried to allow me to\
  \ be touched by the air she felt seventy years ago, since little has touched her\
  \ in the last ten years, with the progression of the disease. It was as if our mission\
  \ were to build, together, new memories that she herself was no longer capable of\
  \ creating.\n        As we ascended towards S\xE3o Jorge Castle, my cousin explained\
  \ to me in detail, performing an encyclopedic tone, that it was a fortification\
  \ built by the Muslims in the eleventh century and about its importance after the\
  \ Conquest of Lisbon to the throne of the first king of Portugal, D. Alfonso Henriques.\
  \ At that moment, I tried to get closer to this century; get closer to what I knew\
  \ of its worldliness, about the books written at the time, and if books were written;\
  \ and I realized that the caravels had not yet docked in South America, not even\
  \ in Africa, and I thought that perhaps it might had been a better world to live\
  \ in. Finding out that the houses and low-rise buildings seemed to have been recently\
  \ repainted, my cousin told me about the rapid pace of real estate interventions\
  \ throughout the city, the entry of the Airbnb concept into the capital, the revitalization\
  \ of areas that have revived after the end of a long crisis that Portugal had faced\
  \ in the 2000s, and we laughed as we tried to guess in which century the stones\
  \ of those paths had been placed there, how many shoed feet had walked there, trying\
  \ both of us to picture an exact figure for a process that had begun so long before\
  \ our own family histories.\n           As we left the castle and continued to explore\
  \ the Alfama district, forcing our knees down the slopes, it seemed to me that something\
  \ was out of place: in the middle of a narrow street, there was a building unlike\
  \ any other around us. My cousin, already prepared to begin his academic speech,\
  \ reported that we were beholding the Ruins of the Roman theater of Lisbon, dating\
  \ from the first century, and that had only been discovered thanks to one of the\
  \ greatest earthquakes in history, which afflicted Lisbon in 1755. In that theater,\
  \ the stage and the benches had contours that were easy to recognize; ruins from\
  \ time immemorial were living right next to hostel facades led by young people who\
  \ eventually got used to this surprise, and now passed by without being moved. We\
  \ continued to talk about this finding carved in the middle of the stone sidewalk,\
  \ already considered old for me; about how history is alive and merges into almost\
  \ forgotten memories and these that are happening, like ours and those of my grandmother."
