Text: "I pay homage to my land. Mine. As if I own the old Cape Dutch farmsteads that\
  \ hosts us. Surrounded by vineyards. I am the same as the girls with those large\
  \ dresses that lays the cowdung floors. I am the horses that died in the wars here\
  \ between the tribes. The ladies with hats, the flaneurs from the ships that still\
  \ walks the streets of a few desolate towns. Them leopard paw imprints on the fields\
  \ and rhinoceros\u2019 shields. I am these beaches. The San Rock Art malls. These\
  \ mountains that swallowed my husband. Dear Stellenbosch, you beaut. At a certain\
  \ time of year the ancestor spirits move to the waters of the Eerste Rivier. I know\
  \ because they tell me so without a voice or words and I can see their refelection\
  \ on the ten cents, Sir. The ten cents they sometimes place on my way. I then know\
  \ where to go from here. Because there are so many doors. And so many pathways and\
  \ hiking trials and cycling through forest spaces. There are endless mountainscapes\
  \ with rainbow coloured rocks and pools from waterfalls and fountains. Theatre,\
  \ film festivals and monuments of the past. Proof of a future with less lies. Electricity\
  \ is low sometimes and raging fires in summer for days. Some people dont even have\
  \ toilets. But its ok because others have interior decorators to import theirs from\
  \ Italy. Some people have not seen the ocean yet. Because they have no time to travel\
  \ from inland as they work on farms with no vacation and no transport. But don\u2019\
  t be alarmed, it is ok because others do and achieves marches to space in shuttles\
  \ and win awards for capturing this. I once asked God why it is so that we covered\
  \ the hills with wine, Sir. And He said because the people needs it so. Or She.\
  \ Who knows anything about which they don't know."
