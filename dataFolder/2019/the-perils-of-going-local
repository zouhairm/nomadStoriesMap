Text: "There are moments in everyone\u2019s life where one thinks: \u201CHow did I\
  \ end up here?\u201D\n\nFor me, lying naked face-down on a damp concrete floor in\
  \ a North African hammam being waterboarded by a toothless octogenarian, who \u2013\
  \ as it transpired \u2013 still hadn\u2019t forgiven me for waking her up, was one\
  \ of them.\n\nYet I only had myself to blame. There I was in Marrakesh\u2019s central\
  \ square, batting away touters who fervently pushed fliers for fancy candlelit massages\
  \ into the faces of passing westerners, determined to dodge the expensive tourist\
  \ traps and experience a local hammam. Why pay $100 for an overpriced treatment\
  \ I could get at home, when I could enjoy an authentic experience for a fraction\
  \ of the price, I\u2019d smugly thought to myself. My quest for adventurous traveller\
  \ status led me to seek out a little, local, women\u2019s only hammam tucked away\
  \ in the midst of a maze of market stalls on one of the city\u2019s backstreets.\
  \ Undeterred by the uninviting exterior, and even perhaps a little enticed by a\
  \ distinct lack of signs in English \u2013 practically guaranteeing its authenticity\
  \ \u2013 I ventured in.\n\nThe first room was again, unpromising. If anything, it\
  \ looked more like a bookies than the entrance to the steamy Turkish style baths\
  \ I had been envisaging. No-one was behind the dusky kiosk however as I looked round\
  \ an old woman, who had been sleeping in rags on the floor behind the door, stirred.\
  \ I offered a smile. She scowled. With reluctant resignation she proceeded to stand,\
  \ then shuffle towards the door to the kiosk, all the while muttering what I can\
  \ only imagine to be wonderfully visceral curses in Arabic.\n\nAfter a brief exchange\
  \ of money for a bucket she led me inside a small changing room where two or three\
  \ Moroccan women were busy chatting away. Anxious to be culturally sensitive, I\
  \ presented my bikini to the room in search of approval. The room \u2013 and its\
  \ occupants \u2013 had no initial qualms with my attire but once dressed, they gestured\
  \ for me to remove the top half. Puzzled by this apparent desire to make me more\
  \ \u2013 not less \u2013 naked than I\u2019d deemed culturally appropriate I hesitated\
  \ before joining the rest in semi-nakedness. \n\nMs Mother Teresa lookalike 2018\
  \ by now entirely naked, carrying a bottle of soap in the one hand and a plastic\
  \ stool in the other, beckoned me to follow her. As we walked through the dank,\
  \ bare concrete rooms I was stuck by the contrast between the images I\u2019d had\
  \ in my mind, and had seen on fliers and the reality of what lay before me. I saw\
  \ none of the brightly coloured rooms covered in tiles with intricate mosaics, none\
  \ of the arches or candlelit steamy baths. Instead the room was dark, cold and bare\
  \ \u2013 punctuated only by the occasional low level tap and lit dimly by high level\
  \ windows.\n\nThe old lady decamped at a spare tap and gestured for me to sit beside\
  \ her. Dutifully I did as I was told but no sooner had I settled in my place than\
  \ I was abruptly knocked back by a flood of water; cold. And another; this time\
  \ warmer. \u201CReally, lady, that was uncalled for!\u201D I spluttered, clearing\
  \ the hair from my eyes. A gleeful, toothless grin came across her face as she proceeded\
  \ to viciously scrub my body in the manner of an over attentive grandmother at bath-time.\
  \ Then, without warning in the midst of this virtual water boarding she yanked my\
  \ pants down my legs. \n\n\u201CNow, hold on a second! That space is reversed for\
  \ particularly smooth lotharios and gynaecologists and you lady \u2013 unless you\
  \ produce a surprise medical certificate in the next ten seconds \u2013 appear to\
  \ be neither!\u201D I protested. But she was relentless.\n\nNow utterly naked, lying\
  \ face down on a cold floor, being intermittently half drowned by buckets of water,\
  \ scrubbed red raw by a debauched geriatric masseuse, I regretted having earlier\
  \ been so dismissive of the luxury spas.\n\nStill I laughed.\n\nYou had to."
