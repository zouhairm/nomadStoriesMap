Text: "\"Moin Moin\" (means Hello) Schilksee is located at 20 minutes by car from\
  \ Kiel, somewhere in the north of Germany, Land of Vikings, large ships and sailors.\
  \ The first time I went to this region, I was not enthusiastic. I knew the Belgian\
  \ North Sea and it depresses me... I had many apprehensions about the Baltic Sea.\
  \ I was thinking it was boring, grey and cold. What a surprise when I arrived !\
  \ The light is different than the North Sea and the water\xB4s colour is blue and\
  \ transparent, the sea is often calm as on a lake. The sky at the beginning and\
  \ end of the day reflects romantic colours and the sound of seagulls and waves rock\
  \ us. The time stops in Schilksee. Even the locals seem calmer, very nice behind\
  \ rough appearances. We eat good fish, and if we\xB4re lucky, we can meet small\
  \ dolphins or seals. Our activity was windsurfing in the morning in the nearby resort.\
  \ Club run by a dutch, the atmosphere is family and relaxed, far from the noise\
  \ and snobbery of some other resorts. Sailing or paddle lessons, laughter and barking\
  \ of the old dog... we let ourselves be carried away by a zen and timeless rhythm\
  \ of life. The afternoon we go for an ice cream at Bruno\xB4s restaurant, cycling\
  \ and stone-picking. Take the ferry to Laboe, the pretty one with the fishermen's\
  \ houses is also a pleasant activity. Some day, we go on the traces of the Vikings\
  \ or compare with the browner colors of the North Sea. But my haven of peace is\
  \ schilksee, this cocoon of sweetness, beauty and kindness. This beach with its\
  \ small white huts...it\xB4s the paradise ! german Brittany, everybody is happy\
  \ in that part of the Baltic Sea:-)\n\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator"
