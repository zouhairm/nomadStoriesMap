Text: "Road trips have always been my favorite as far as I can remember. One summer,\
  \ my parents decided to go on a little spiritual vacation to a *derasar* and *dharamshala*\
  \ (3 hour drive from Mumbai at Ambesari, Dahanu). Clearly, my sister and I weren\u2019\
  t really into the whole spiritual vacation idea but nevertheless, they had me at\
  \ road trip! After reaching the place and doing all our holy rituals (Puja), we\
  \ found out about a Natural Therapy Centre in close proximity. It was in the middle\
  \ of a small agricultural village with people living in bamboo huts. No sooner did\
  \ we reach there than we were greeted by curious little faces glaring at our car.\
  \ Looking at them for the first time, I perfectly remember making a disgusted face\
  \ and scooting closer to my mom. With hardly any clothes to wear, they were dirty,\
  \ and dark skinned but that didn\u2019t fade their broad smiles. They waved at us\
  \ giggling and soon  went back to playing their made up games.\n\nSkeptical at our\
  \ decision of coming here, we entered. This Centre used Mud Therapy, Yoga and a\
  \ Strict diet to help patients. Patients? Senior citizens with age related ailings.\
  \ My sister and I knew at this moment, we were doomed. Good thing we had packed\
  \ a lot of games, we survived Day One. The following day, we were going to try the\
  \ mud therapy wherein they apply therapeutic mud all over your body, followed by\
  \ a sun bathe . I HATED the idea of having mud all over my body though I didn\u2019\
  t let them apply it over my face. It was horrible. \n\nWhile we are surviving these\
  \ new experiences, the kids were enjoying their silly little games. Every night,\
  \ one of the grandfather\u2019s would gather these kids around, sit under the stars\
  \ and they would recite poetries and sing songs. That night, he asked us to join\
  \ and reluctantly we did! But somehow it turned out to be so much fun. I started\
  \ talking to the other kids and many were of my age. They had this game \u2013 The\
  \ lion and the sheep. All you have to do is form a circle and hold hands. One kid\
  \ will be the lion and the other, the sheep. The lion has to catch the sheep. The\
  \ sheep can go inside the circle from under the joined hands but the lion cannot.\
  \ That\u2019s all I vaguely remember. That night I was so tired but content that\
  \ I slept as soon as I hit the bed.\n\nOur mornings started with yoga and herbal\
  \ tea. That day, I helped pick Pudina(Mint) and Tulsi(Holy Basil) Leaves for the\
  \ tea. The workers were cutting lemon grass with a sickle and I was curious to lay\
  \ my hands at it. It was a task, so heavy and so difficult. I\u2019ve never liked\
  \ getting dirty but there I was, trying to learn an irrelevant but a new skill whilst\
  \ trying to communicate in broken Marathi with the workers. I asked them when would\
  \ their kids wake up. I couldn\u2019t wait to play with them! That day I learned\
  \ their names. Sunita, Sangeeta, Kavita, etc.. The coming three days were the best\
  \ ones of my vacation that I still cherish time and again. Then came the day to\
  \ return to our chaotic reality. I knew this friendship was just for the time being\
  \ owing to lack of communication mediums, and we would all forget each other within\
  \ a few days.\n\nBut, that wasn\u2019t the case. That year, my sister and I didn\u2019\
  t burst any crackers during Diwali and from the amount we saved, our parents bought\
  \ clothes for those kids. The next vacation, we went to the same place. Sadly, the\
  \ therapy centre had closed down but as soon as I got out of my car, they had gathered\
  \ around and guess what? They still remembered my name! We distributed clothes and\
  \ some food and biscuits, played for a little while and then we said good-bye for\
  \ the last time. I haven\u2019t been there since but those faces still pop up in\
  \ my mind sometimes."
