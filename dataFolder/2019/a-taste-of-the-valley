Text: "Sticky around my lips from the honey-dipped end, a sweet smoky flavour whispers\
  \ on my tongue. I choke. Everyone laughs. \n\n\u201CNo inhale!\u201D\n\nMy brain\
  \ had not fully worked out the mechanics of this before I had put my mouth to it.\
  \ I curse in between coughs and they encourage me to try again. I suck in deep,\
  \ and wait.\n\n\u201CLet it out!\u201D \n\nThey laugh again. I savour the woody\
  \ chocolate taste left in my mouth as I let out my own laugh. I could never have\
  \ imagined this moment; never even smoking a cigarette before, trying my first cigar,\
  \ in small hut with a handful of strangers, in the middle of the Vi\xF1ales Valley.\
  \ \n\nAnd yet, here we are.\n\n*\n\nRoberto finds me walking on my way back to my\
  \ casa in and offers me a ride for a small fee. The air is wet and heavy and my\
  \ skin is already sticky; I welcome the kind offer. As he shows me around the corner\
  \ to what I think will be his car, there stands a humble horse and carriage.\n\n\
  \u201CTaxi natural!\u201D he presents to me with a chuckle.\n\nI take a breath as\
  \ he pulls me up with calloused hands and steers his horse onto the road. Her name\
  \ is Coco Loco, he tells me. I see his eyes crease as he smiles, the wrinkles around\
  \ his mouth; I can believe that he is much younger than he looks, his dark tan skin\
  \ signing to premature aging, a natural contribution from the Cuban sun. \n\nI hold\
  \ on tightly to the back of the seat, the road is uneven and my whole body bounces\
  \ against the wood. I will wake up to the bruises the following day. We talk in\
  \ a slow, mixed language of my broken Spanish and his local curiosity. Deciding\
  \ to take me on a short detour around the valley as my self-appointed guide, he\
  \ points to every farm we pass, the vast borders of vegetables poking out from the\
  \ red, iron-rich earth, a note to every mango tree on our way. We are surrounded\
  \ by so much green, open land, dirt paths shaded by tropical trees and the great\
  \ mogotes, mountain-like formations of limestone, in the backdrop. It\u2019s a refreshing\
  \ contrast to the colours and dusty chaos of Havana. I can feel myself breathing\
  \ deeper here, my chest opening; the quiet of the valley and the smell of the natural\
  \ landscape grounding me in the moment.\n\nRoberto lets me take the reigns for a\
  \ while, encouraging me as he demonstrates how to hold my arms and steer. I\u2019\
  m surprised by the weight of it, the ease of control resting in my hands. Veering\
  \ off the main road, we come to a pause and allow Coco Loco take a rest. Roberto\
  \ removes her harness and we leave her grazing under a tree. I follow him across\
  \ the field to a small tobacco plantation, where my impromptu tour begins.\n\nAs\
  \ a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the land is protected from the use of any pesticides\
  \ and chemicals, meaning that the tobacco grown here is purely organic. Once the\
  \ leaves are harvested and dried, 90% is bought by the government to make the branded\
  \ cigars in their factories; the very same cigars that are also exported and sold\
  \ outside of the country. The farmers keep the remaining 10% to make their own cigars\
  \ for personal use and sales; their final product 100% organic.\n\nWe come to a\
  \ small hut in the middle of two fields of growing tobacco plants. The walls are\
  \ made from panels of corrugated metal that come together in a triangular form,\
  \ the only light inside coming from the doorway and a few missing panels from the\
  \ front wall. Multiple beams run across the inside structure where the tobacco leaves\
  \ are hung to dry, though they remain empty now. \n\nHeads look up when I walk in,\
  \ casting a shadow over the space. There is a small cluster of people sitting on\
  \ wooden benches near the entrance. I breathe in the smokiness, a charred caramel-like\
  \ smell teasing my senses, and I am welcomed into the group with the warmest of\
  \ smiles and the taste of my first cigar."
