Text: "Off the coast of Lagos\u2019 mainland is Makoko; a community largely situated\
  \ n water. A vast floating insanitary slum filled with heartbreak, hope and resilience.\
  \ It is a nation onto itself.\n\nAs one crosses the Third Mainland Bridge, the single\
  \ pathway between the mainland and the island of Lagos, they are graced with a coastal\
  \ view of the community. The wooden houses built on bamboo stilts, almost uncomfortably\
  \ close to each other, are an extreme contrast to the modernity of the island.\n\
  \  Life in Makoko runs on its own frequency. At a young age, the children of Makoko\
  \ are taught how to swim in a rather unusual manner. The mother, whilst holding\
  \ onto one of the child\u2019s arms, dips the children into the Lagos Lagoon, and\
  \ springs them out, in then out, in then out. This motion is repeated until the\
  \ children have adapted to the water and can float and maneuver around the water\
  \ on their own. As their main source of transportation, canoes are the next frontier\
  \ after learning to swim. They are taught how to row from a very young age as it\
  \ underpins their daily existence through fishing, trading, transporting wood \u2013\
  \ for building new homes, etc. Also built in Makoko, these canoes are made of wood,\
  \ tar and nails, owned per family and can be identified by the engravings of the\
  \ family names on them. \n  Teeming with the urgencies of everyday life, Makoko\
  \ is a kaleidoscope of experiences, with a unique way of evolving alongside its\
  \ occupants. While visitors to the community are initially concerned by the precariousness\
  \ of their circumstances, the pervasive joy of the residents quickly puts those\
  \ concerns to rest. Abounding in smiles, laughter and an ingrained willingness to\
  \ help one another, they take great pleasure in simple encounters with good music\
  \ and good company. Limited resources are put aside, if only temporarily, in the\
  \ faces of children playing across structures with each other, and resilient women\
  \ and men running businesses out of their canoes of buildings. The Makoko community\
  \ is just that. Though deprived of much, they have humanity in abundance."
