Text: "I recently moved to Canada in August of 2018. I\u2019m an Indian born and brought\
  \ up in Kuwait and never really understood the concept of \u201Cback home\u201D\
  \ till I migrated. Pre 2018 India back home was a 3 hour flight and going and coming\
  \ did not mean flying forward or backward in time. Now \u201Chome\u201D is a far\
  \ away concept.\n\nMy friends, my tribe is now across an ocean and we are connected\
  \ by the invisible line of the internet. My Whatsapp and mobile data are the only\
  \ things that are keep me sane, as it enables me to be in constant contact with\
  \ my best friend Ellen. Thanks to her and the rest of my girly clan I was able to\
  \ make my \u201Cmaiden\u201D international trip to Thailand, the flight ticket was\
  \ a birthday gift for my thirtieth. \n\nIn February of 2018, Ellen and I flew to\
  \ Thailand on what we did not know yet was going to be the yard stick all future\
  \ vacations would be compared to. I had heard it was the land of debauchery for\
  \ men looking for a cheap holiday. A place where the women in their lives would\
  \ rarely ever know what goes on at a bachelor party or a boy\u2019s trip. I went\
  \ there wondering what a place marketed to cater to male fantasies would offer two\
  \ single girlfriends.\n\nWe experienced almost anything a man would there and dare\
  \ I say enjoyed it more if not as much. We meandered down walking streets, lined\
  \ with loud open bars with women dancing on top of tables as men flirted and gazed\
  \ up at them. I danced with ladyboys who had a great time with me and all I had\
  \ to was buy them a shot of tequila as a tip for the good time they showed me. A\
  \ very intriguing concept called a \u201CPing Pong Show\u201D fascinated us. Many\
  \ reviews from other friends who had experienced the show were that they walked\
  \ out because they could not stomach the contents of the show. Ellen and I on the\
  \ contrary gawked in wonder at the women who were able to smoke multiple cigarettes,\
  \ shoot darts and other curious things out their privates. Ellen came up with the\
  \ theory that anatomically these everyday activities are not possible from that\
  \ particular female body part and was convinced that they must have some crafty\
  \ contraption up there that makes those things happen. We both concluded that nonetheless\
  \ these women were talented!\n\nWe drank alcohol at every opportunity and binge\
  \ ate every Thai curry dish we could find. I told Ellen later that we managed to\
  \ eat the whole of Thailand (this is not an underestimation we came back to Kuwait\
  \ many pounds heavier). We savored the sights, sounds and the general aura of sex\
  \ that laced the air. It is not a life we could be a part of everyday but it was\
  \ a unique experience.\n\nThe two of us availed of the services of massage parlors\
  \ as soon as we spotted the establishments. I don\u2019t think we will ever find\
  \ hands that will massage us to sleep with the pungent smelling tiger balm as lubricant.\n\
  \nWe watched a caberet show and a show that only can be described as broadway-like,\
  \ that featured Thai history. The stage and costume production were unlike any I\
  \ have seen before the lady boys of Simon\u2019s Caberet were mesmerizing in their\
  \ garments that looked like they were dripping gold and diamonds. While the Siam\
  \ Nimaret had life size boats float on stage and simulate a thunderstorm within\
  \ the four walls of a closed auditorium.\n\nThe last day was the perfect ending\
  \ to our holiday and we unknowingly saved the best for last. We went island hopping\
  \ and snorkeling in waters so clear and blue I only thought they existed in movies.\
  \ We spent that evening eating ice cream, getting a final sleep inducing foot massage\
  \ and savoring our authentic spicy seafood curries. \n\nI discovered that no matter\
  \ where you go that with the right company a holiday destination meant for men could\
  \ become a maiden\u2019s best holiday."
