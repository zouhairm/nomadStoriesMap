Text: "Parque del Retiro, Madrid, Espa\xF1a. You get there with moderate expectations\
  \ \u2013 it\u2019s a winter afternoon, after all. But you\u2019re soon blown away,\
  \ and even if you could hit an instant-spring-button that made flowers blossom and\
  \ trees bud, you wouldn\u2019t. The leafless trees and their sober yet beautiful\
  \ atmosphere, so different from the evergreen Brazilian trees you\u2019re used to\u2026\
  \ The solid blue lake reflecting the bright blue sky and its very few clouds\u2026\
  \ \n\nAre you picturing it? I could go on describing stuff, but I guess I\u2019\
  ve made my point already. That\u2019s exactly how I pictured my visit, months before\
  \ going there. Thing is, things didn\u2019t turn out exactly how I pictured them.\
  \ And I blame my sister. And the sun. Or the lack of it. Maybe Earth\u2019s rotation\
  \ movement.\n\nLet me explain. That was a pretty rushed and tiring trip. We had\
  \ just a few days in each city we visited, so we arranged our daily schedules in\
  \ a way that we\u2019d be back to our hotel just after the sunset\u2014and every\
  \ day in which we\u2019d visit a park, we\u2019d save it for last, so we got to\
  \ see the sunset in a beautiful, full of nature scenario. \n\nMakes perfect sense,\
  \ doesn\u2019t it?\n\nNo, it doesn\u2019t. \n\nWhen I said we \u201Carranged our\
  \ daily schedules\u201D I was being quite complacent on ourselves. We planned everything\
  \ very poorly and we stuck to that poor plan even poorly-er. Yeah, that\u2019s a\
  \ \u201CHow Not To Travel 101\u201D column you\u2019re reading. And this is a story\
  \ on how me and my sister created our very own tradition of visiting Europe\u2019\
  s main urban parks when it\u2019s dark and you can barely see a thing. \n\nI have\
  \ to admit I got very upset that night. Sorry sis.\n\nBut then I took some deep\
  \ breaths and thought to myself: \u201CYou\u2019re in fucking Madrid. You can\u2019\
  t let that get to you.\u201D You know, Buddhist shit. It actually works. So I was\
  \ sitting there in a lotus posit\u2014just kidding. I was sitting there and I tried\
  \ to enjoy the moment for what it was. Dark and cold, but still Madrid. I couldn\u2019\
  t see much of the park, but still I was there. We just sat on a bench and did some\
  \ night-fl\xE2neuring. \n\nIt\u2019s important that I now give you some context:\
  \ I\u2019m Brazilian. In Brazil, we don\u2019t have a proper winter. We pretty much\
  \ live up to the stereotype of sunbathed-flip-flop-wearers. We love the sun and\
  \ the summer, and I\u2019ve always heard people talking about how depressing winters\
  \ were in Europe and how people there survived them and just truly lived when summer\
  \ arrived. I\u2019ve always been so sorry for all those people locked  up in their\
  \ apartments, counting down the days for the season to change\u2026\n\nIf you\u2019\
  re from Madrid you\u2019re probably already laughing at me at this point. I mean,\
  \ really? Did I trully think that winter would keep you from enjoying your lives?!\
  \ Oh, silly me.\n\nMadrid got me there. It\u2019s a beautiful city and all that,\
  \ but its particularity is that it\u2019s fully taken by its population. And what\
  \ other use is there for a city? Everywhere you go, it doesn\u2019t matter the weather,\
  \ it doesn\u2019t matter the hours, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s crowded\
  \ with tourists\u2026 There will always be a ton of locals living their own lives,\
  \ doing their own stuff, enjoying and occupying their own city.\n\nThat was a weekday\
  \ and it was getting late. My Brazilian DNA was shivering from the cold. Nevertheless,\
  \ there were entire families strolling; young people gathered, listening to loud\
  \ music; roller skates classes with improvised obstacles\u2014and I\u2019m not even\
  \ making that up.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m able to think of at least a dozen reasons\
  \ on why I can\u2019t walk my dogs if I\u2019m feeling lazy. 8\xBAC outside is a\
  \ pretty damn good reason. Yet, those people there don\u2019t even bother. Is it\
  \ cold? Winter clothes. Is it dark? Street lighting. There isn\u2019t any? Be your\
  \ own light, then! No Buddhist shit intended this time. It\u2019s literal. Strap\
  \ a light collar around your dog\u2019s neck, you lazy! You know what is way more\
  \ beautiful than Parque del Retiro itself?\n\nLed-lit golden retrievers taking late\
  \ night walks in it."
