Text: "Marvelous; it was indeed a Sunday morning. Surrounded by a 360\xB0 view of\
  \ dense, lush green vegetation, there I stood somewhere within the Glenrock State\
  \ Conservation Area in 3\xB0C weather. The air was still allowing for the morning\
  \ harmonies of more than 20 different species of birds to flood the hallowed places\
  \ of the forest with their singing and chirping. \n\nAs steady as a Sniper\u2019\
  s finger on a rifle trigger, I took on the ever changing terrain this hike threw\
  \ at me.\nBreath taking views, meandering rivers & streams, cascading falls and\
  \ glorious sights of beautifully decorated birds were at every turn. The more I\
  \ allowed nature to consume me, the more my eyes began to open. \n\nAlas, I stumbled\
  \ upon on route that I believed provided the most incredible vantage point with\
  \ the entire reserve and now, the destination seemed clear. \nOne river, flowing\
  \ immaculately, in the very middle of the reserve with flora and fauna on either\
  \ bank. Oh what a sight! A few miles down the mouth of the river empties into the\
  \ Tasman sea. \nI can already feel the sense of accomplishment from this adventure\
  \ to the rivers mouth I\u2019m about to embark on. \n\nWith determination & the\
  \ will to conquer, i set off with my personal dose of self motivation. \nAs much\
  \ as my sole objective was to get to that destination I couldn\u2019t help but take\
  \ a quick break when i found a tree swing in the middle of nowhere right up the\
  \ edge of a cliff. The joy that overcame me drove me to let my inner child out and\
  \ just swing. Swing like there wasn\u2019t a thing off balance in the world at that\
  \ moment; for that brief moment i felt free. \n\nAs i drew nearer and nearer to\
  \ my shangri-la, the sun peeked thus illuminating the forest revealing  more of\
  \ its beauty and secrets. \nIt was even better than I imagined, the spray of the\
  \ sea, the chill trade winds; I was happy i woke up on the right side of adventure.\
  \ \nOn this beautiful Sunday morning I conquered Glenrock State Conservation Area\
  \ on an empty stomach & before 12 noon."
