Text: "My Name is Fifi Eliazar. I like to travel some many places and It was last\
  \ April 2018, I was in N\xFCremberg,Germany.\nIt is little city in Germany but so\
  \ beautiful and historical places. It was my first trip that I have gone so far\
  \ away from my home, a little bit nervous but I met some of new friends, learn new\
  \ experiences and learn more for art and my skill to photographs. It is like 11,500kms\
  \ from Indonesia.\nActually I was affraid because I was a solo travel going there.\
  \ But I am thankfull to God that I can visit there.\nWhen first time I arrived there\
  \ I already falling love with the air and weather there.\nMy favorite bread that\
  \ I have eaten was the apple pie and it is so delicious.\nIn N\xFCremberg, have\
  \ many artist people. They have skills to sing, playing music, make a magic from\
  \ the soil, and some attraction on the street in the main city.\nIt have a Christmas\
  \ market too and it was so fantastic.\nThere is many historical buildings, castles\
  \ and even for secret places.\nIn N\xFCremberg have a beautiful of park which many\
  \ have flowers. \nI like to chill with dandelion flowers. It is so amazing flower\
  \ when I blew it, it is so nice feeling and make it to be in photograph.\nThere\
  \ is a lake too and some old historical church even in the village of N\xFCremberg.\n\
  I see have many ducks swim in the lake and it's so beautiful for photographs too,\
  \ I would like to draw it because I like draw art too.they have many colors and\
  \ I have been on the rabbit farm too.\nThe rabbit was so big size like an cat. it\
  \ is bigger than in the rabbit in my country but they are so cute and I would like\
  \ to have one and bring in to my home but the rule in aeroplane not allow for pets,\
  \ it was so sad.\nThere is some artificial which selling some art from silver or\
  \ iron and even gold in the main of city.\nHave some stores promotion too and all\
  \ people like \"SALE\" because many discount for buying some stuff there.\nThere\
  \ is event of blue moon festival there but I am sad because I cannot attend the\
  \ party event in main city because I was trap on the jungle. It is a long story\
  \ because I was in train go to picnic with some friends. My friend told me that\
  \ the festival so nice because all is blue colors, everywhere is blue light. I am\
  \ so sad I wish I can be there if I luck in future.\nI like to picnic in the jungle,\
  \ it is so peaceful even it is so cold, the air is like 5-6 degrees celcius on that\
  \ time and it is summer.\nI like to be there but it needs some more money too to\
  \ live there.\nMy friend told me that if you work in Germany, you should bring half\
  \ of your salary to the government. The government will take care of you and your\
  \ family. That is rules to be there.\nI know why Germany government have made that\
  \ rules because the government wants to help some poor people there who jobless\
  \ and homeless. That's so nice of their government.\nBut I am some dissapointed\
  \ for drugstore and doctor there because they aren't to the point like doctor in\
  \ Asia' countries and 8pm all places was closed.\nWhile weekend is like in silent\
  \ Hill games. No one on the street only some people go to church.\nAnd I love to\
  \ eat halawa. It's like ice cream but it's beans cream that selling on Arabic market\
  \ there. There is many Arabic stores near in bahnhoff train station.\nNever forget\
  \ to come on time while you have to go with train because when the train door is\
  \ close, it is like a crap! You must be waiting for 30-75minutes for next train!\
  \ Germany is to green country, so clean nice and I will continue to write on my\
  \ own page. Thank you for reading and have enjoy it. God bless you."
