Text: "Waiting for the bus in Havana I instinctively pull out my IPhone, then I recall\
  \ that there is no connection in Cuba. Disappointed in my automatic reaction to\
  \ check my device I look up and scan the terminal. In almost no time at all a tall\
  \ and athletic African/Caribbean guy wearing a brightly coloured fedora approaches,\
  \ and with a warm smile asks \u201Care you Danish?\u201D\n\nFast forward 24 hours\
  \ and this simple question has led to multiple Havana Rums and a night of Salsa\
  \ dancing, it\u2019s safe to say I have found my Cuban adventure partner.\n\nEric\
  \ was a chilled, highly intelligent individual who loved fedora hats\u2026. I mean\
  \ seriously loved them! For him, travel was more about the people than the destination.\
  \ He had picked up conversational Spanish after 6 weeks in Colombia and would chat\
  \ with anyone and everyone he could. He was like a human sponge soaking up good\
  \ karma from everyone whose path he crossed, it was something I admired, but wasn\u2019\
  t that good at, maybe I could learn with Eric\u2019s help. \n\nHaving conquered\
  \ Cuban rum and Salsa we decided to get serious and explore the UNESCO World heritage\
  \ area, Valle de Vi\xF1ales. We setoff down a dirt path. The huge limestone walls,\
  \ which the valley is known for provide a spectacular backdrop. It had been a long\
  \ time since I had enjoyed a view that was not interrupted by buildings, crowds\
  \ or branding. It was a soothing and immersing experience and for the first time\
  \ in months I felt truly relaxed. Little did I know, that feeling was temporary!\n\
  \nOver two hours later we drew near the gargantuan limestone walls, that, as we\
  \ set-off, seemed so close! I was not fit like my new, well-travelled companion.\
  \ My body was beginning to scream with tiredness, my feet were aching and I was\
  \ thirsty. Eager to turn back, Eric urged me on with his infectious enthusiasm,\
  \ \u201Cwho knows when you\u2019ll be back, come on let\u2019s get this done\u201D\
  . Turning back early was not an option it seemed\u2026\n\nAs we walked over the\
  \ next knoll, we spotted a woman dressed head to toe in pink, working her plot of\
  \ tobacco plants. Her face was weathered but had a softness that showed signs of\
  \ a happy life. As I had come to expect, Eric quickly strikes up a conversation\
  \ in his broken Spanish. Before I knew it our day\u2019s itinerary changed direction\
  \ in a dramatic way.\n\nWe were now following our new friend, wading through a sea\
  \ of giant tobacco leaves towards a distant barn. The barn was rustic and full of\
  \ character, as we entered my senses went into overload. The smell of the tobacco\
  \ was grassy, slightly sweet and surprisingly pleasant, even for a non-smoker. The\
  \ tobacco leaves, meticulously hung from every rafter and wall, forming a beautiful\
  \ natural tapestry. We drunk in the moment, before our friend launched into cigar\
  \ making 101 with a passion that belied her age.  \n\nThe class soon moved to our\
  \ friend\u2019s nearby home. The home was very neat and very tiny, but clearly sufficient\
  \ for her needs. She shared the home with her two children who\u2019s rooms were\
  \ separated by curtains. We sat down at a side table which acted as the dining table,\
  \ located close to the kitchen. Our friend was clearly proud of her home and content\
  \ with life.  As we rolled our leaves into cigars, I felt a sense of privilege to\
  \ have been welcomed in. Eric and I look at each other and no words were needed.\
  \ We were overwhelmed by her generosity. I thought back to my automatic reaction\
  \ to check my IPhone at the bus station and wondered, had I had connection would\
  \ my journey in Cuba have been the same? \n\nYes, Cuba may not have internet, or\
  \ access to the modern luxuries that we take for granted. But this humbling experience\
  \ was a salient reminder of what\u2019s important in life, contentment is not found\
  \ in the things we have, but the people we meet and surround ourselves with. In\
  \ the space of 48 hours, I had made a lifelong friend, had some life lessons reinforced,\
  \ and enjoyed a truly authentic and genuine travel experience."
