Text: "Today we're talking about culture.\n\nEvery piece of architecture matters.\
  \ History matters. And also simple people matter. Ones, carrying groceries home.\
  \ Sharing water on the streets. Arguing for a place in line. Preparing carpets for\
  \ sale. Driving cart with a sheep in there.\n\nThus carpets will be sold. Groceries\
  \ will be eaten. Sheeps will be sacrificed during the Eid Al-Adha holiday.\n\n\"\
  Have you get lost?\" - that was the question from the stranger guys aside, who stood\
  \ and stared at us from the street in Ain Sebaa, district in Casablanca. They were\
  \ quite right: who could suppose to see two white girls from Russia and USA walking\
  \ around with cameras during Eid Al-Adha \u2013 Sacrifice day, the day, when everybody\
  \ is spending time at home with family and preparing recently killed sheep for God's\
  \ sake?\nIf in Morocco we lived on resort near the ocean we would never see a performance\
  \ like this. Bloody rivers, leather, smoked sheep\u2019s heads, men with red hands\
  \ were everywhere. Culture shock? Maybe, but we respect and embrace it. We live\
  \ in Ain Sebaa like local people. I see them, I feel them, I accept them in all\
  \ of their diversity. Morocco shared a piece of culture with such a different us.\
  \ We are grateful. Who's next will dare to see?"
