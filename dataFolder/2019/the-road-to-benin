Text: "Exhausted from hormones, heat, and stress, I pull myself out of bed at 4 a.m.\
  \ for the 150-kilometer drive to a beach weekend in Ouidah, Benin. Yesterday I spent\
  \ the afternoon lying on a rough-sheeted white cot in a tiny room in Lagos, Nigeria,\
  \ listening out the window to motos beeping and Area Boys shouting their wares,\
  \ waiting for the doctor to perform the IUI that will make my son. Last year I lived\
  \ in Albany, New York, and now, I am here.\n\nWe\u2019re hoping to beat the notoriously\
  \ bad Lagosian traffic, but our escort is late. By 6 a.m., my wife's hands are tight\
  \ on the RAV4\u2019s steering wheel as she inches her way through a market fully\
  \ overrunning the Bagadry Expressway on the outskirts of the city. She navigates\
  \ around streams of people, danfo minibuses, \u201880s sedans packed to the brim\
  \ with pineapples and cassava, trucks belching black smoke and sloshing gallons\
  \ of water with every start. At one particularly tense bottleneck, she misinterprets\
  \ the traffic guard\u2019s hand signals and is rewarded with the threat of the woman\u2019\
  s scrap metal club raised towards our car. \n\nHours later, the city starts to fade\
  \ away into palm trees. The Expressway is poorly named, and I regret sitting shotgun.\
  \ I feel my stomach drop every time my wife swerves to avoid the three-foot potholes,\
  \ and when she accelerates above twenty on the stretches that are free of other\
  \ cars but crumble off, with no guardrail, from pavement to ground five feet below.\
  \ We bypass a dozen or more traffic stops, men with AK47s and face masks waving\
  \ us over to collect their bribe, only pulling aside their road spikes when our\
  \ escort car flashes its lights. In these moments, both the weight and the lightness\
  \ of our privilege are inescapable.  \n\nBenin\u2019s border with Nigeria is Tatooine,\
  \ all dust and lawlessness. Our escort car leaves us, and a dozen men swarm our\
  \ car, each vying to help us navigate the border crossing. I make eye contact with\
  \ the quietest of these men. He leads us into a narrow building of concrete and\
  \ dried palm leaves. Our passport information is copied by hand into a sweaty ledger\
  \ book. \n\n\u201CWhere are you going?\u201D The uniformed immigration man does\
  \ not wait for a response. \u201CCasa del Papa?\u201D \n\nIt is not really a question.\
  \ It is, indeed, where we are going. When we are offered that same response by each\
  \ subsequent border official it becomes clear that there is only one place in the\
  \ entire country of Benin to which expats living in Nigeria go. \u201CLet me guess.\
  \ Casa del Papa?\u201D suggests the man my self-identified expeditor has found for\
  \ me, exchanging our Naira for CFA francs at unfavorable rates behind our car. We\
  \ do not know anything of where we are, but\u2014leaving aside that we are assumed\
  \ to be sisters, not wives\u2014we are known.\n\nThe border itself is a fraying\
  \ rope, secured on one end to a stack of tires and held on the other by a bored\
  \ seeming man who lowers it into a muddy puddle and waves us through. We follow\
  \ the most trodden path through a tight maze of buildings, many of which have only\
  \ windowed faces and no backs. We miss a turn and an eight-year-old boy, waiting\
  \ in the dead end, smiles at us and points the way back. Once we finally make our\
  \ way out of the labyrinth to the highway, we do a U-turn at the modernized border\
  \ crossing which will open next year. It looks no different than an EZPass toll\
  \ booth. \n\nBenin\u2019s highways are smooth and fast. An hour later, we pass the\
  \ Door of No Return, a memorial arch to enslaved people taken from Ouidah to the\
  \ Americas. Casa del Papa is a sandy ten-minute drive down the beach. There are\
  \ no potholes, no bribes, no angry black smoke. We spend the weekend napping, reading,\
  \ and snacking, listening to the surf crash. Our French is lacking, but of course,\
  \ we are catered to. Three days later, we make the drive back to Lagos. This time,\
  \ it does not seem so strange."
