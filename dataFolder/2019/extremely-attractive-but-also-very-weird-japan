Text: "If you are interested in cherry blossom, you must go to Japan between February\
  \ and March; if you are a big fan of Matsuri \u2013 The traditional Japanese Festivals,\
  \ you must go there between July and August; if you want to have a very different,\
  \ special and romantic Christmas and new year, Japan in December won\u2019t let\
  \ you down. However, if you want to make some Japanese friends during your stay,\
  \ you might find it\u2019s not that easy, compares to the experience you have had\
  \ in European countries or the U.S.A.\nThere is one interesting fact about Japan\
  \ and Japanese is, people in big city like Tokyo or Kyoto, they may be able to speak\
  \ some English, but normally they are not willing to \u2013 mostly because they\
  \ are too shy to speak English.  However, if you go to small cities or towns, you\
  \ will find people are usually much friendlier or willing to talk to you, even they\
  \ don\u2019t speak English at all.\nThere was one time, I went to a place called\
  \ Yayoi-dai, a very small town inside the region of Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture.\
  \ Once I got off the train, I immediately realized that I left my bag in the train,\
  \ with my wallet, ID, cell phone, even the train ticket in it. At that time, I barely\
  \ spoke Japanese and had no clue what I should do, so I panicked. Because it was\
  \ a small town, the station is also small and no people \u201Cactually\u201D work\
  \ there, well, at least not always be the place you could see, like the platform.\
  \  Then I saw a boy, perhaps 11 years old, walking towards the entrance. I couldn\u2019\
  t pass the ticket barrier without the ticket or go anywhere, although I didn\u2019\
  t know how to have a conversation with a child, I knew he was my only chance. I\
  \ ran over, waved my hand and said \u201Chi\u201D.  I bet he had never met a person\
  \ who said \u201Chi\u201D, not \u201CKonnichiwa\u201D in his life, he looked a little\
  \ confused, even a bit overwhelmed. He looked at me, realized I didn\u2019t speak\
  \ his language. I tried to tell him what happened, but he clearly couldn\u2019t\
  \ understand one single word. Suddenly, he started to run towards to the entrance,\
  \ I thought he must have run away from me, which is understandable, I was a stranger\
  \ after all, maybe a weird even dangerous stranger to him. Surprisingly, instead\
  \ of running through the entrance, he went to a metal board with a red button on\
  \ it, he pushed the button, a voice came out of the speaker and he had a conversation\
  \ with the other side. After he had done talking, he said to me, in English, \u201C\
  wait.\u201D \u201COMG, he was trying to help me!\u201D, I figured out and felt sorry\
  \ for thinking he was running away. After a few minutes, a man in uniform came and\
  \ asked what happened, he was not good at English, either, but finally understood\
  \ my problem, also told the boy what happened. I understood he would help me get\
  \ my bag back but didn\u2019t know how it would work. When I thought the boy would\
  \ go this time, he picked up his mobile phone and started to call someone.  \u201C\
  wait.\u201D he said, once again. I saw the station staff was also talking through\
  \ the phone with someone, I guessed he was helping me looking for the bag one station\
  \ by one station.  A few minutes later, a lady came into the station and greeted\
  \ to the staff and the boy, when I heard he shouted \u201CMama\u201D, I realized\
  \ he asked his mother here to help me and she spoke English! She translated for\
  \ us and told me the bag was found in 15 stops away, I would have to wait till the\
  \ train was back here so the bag could be delivered.  Since it would need almost\
  \ 2 hours, she asked me if I would go to her home to have some coffee and snacks,\
  \ because his son asked her to do that. Surely, I did, I didn\u2019t have a dime\
  \ on me and nowhere else could go.  \nAfter that, I and their family became really\
  \ good friends till present day."
