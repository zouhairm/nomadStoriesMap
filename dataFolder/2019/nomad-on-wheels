Text: "I\u2019d been around the globe and back.  I had met strangers in strange places,\
  \ turning them in to best friends in a new home away from home. I had fallen in\
  \ love with foreign, smoldering men with the look of destiny in their eyes and a\
  \ sense of adventure in their smile. And after all the adventure I found myself\
  \ back in school, only 80 miles from where I was born.  I found myself surrounded\
  \ by the security of friends I\u2019d known for years and the comfort of a place\
  \ I\u2019d lived before. But the familiarity was drowning me in daily routine.\n\
  \nIt happened on a Saturday morning in Fort Collins, Colorado and the spring sunshine\
  \ was filtering its way through the silts in my blinds, making the dust sparkle\
  \ in the air as it danced lazily to the floor.  As I managed to roll out of bed,\
  \ I heard the muffled triple thud of someone knocking on the door downstairs.  I\
  \ skipped down the stairs and threw the door open to find my friend Noah. His slumped\
  \ shoulders and shuffling feet exuded boredom as I invited him inside to join me\
  \ in doing nothing on the couch.\n\nAfter racking our brains for myriad off different\
  \ possible activities to fill our weekend like brew tour, climbing or hiking...I\
  \ suggested a little excursion. A small little hitch hiking trip to the state next\
  \ door.  Why not? We had no plans. So an hour later we hit the pavement with a backpack\
  \ each, filled with light provisions, and his dog Hopper.  After only 40 min, we\
  \ reached I-25, the highway to adventure. \n\nWith curiosity in our hearts and confidence\
  \ in our stride we cast out our arms, expose our thumbs and wait for someone to\
  \ take the bait. HOOOOOOONK HOONK! And just like that, we reeled in a massive semi\
  \ as it rumbled past, screeching to a stop only 50 feet up the highway shoulder.\
  \  Throwing expressions of both disbelief and delight at one another we take off\
  \ running towards the door. \n\nWe climbed in the mountain of the Semi cab to find\
  \ ourselves in the company of a cheery, heavily bearded Indian man.  We exchanged\
  \ what seemed like they typical hitchhike talk, trading names, and destinations.\
  \  In no less than two minutes, we were barreling down the road with \u201CRemi\u201D\
  \ as our guide to Larimer Wyoming.  \n\nIn the three hours we spent together, Remi\
  \ transformed from stranger, to driver to someone who felt like an old friend. He\
  \ told us the long story of moving his family from India to California USA, in his\
  \ mind the land of dreams and opportunity. He shared his struggles of maintaining\
  \ a tech job in Silicon Valley, and the decision to leave his family to save them\
  \ by becoming a cross country trucker. But his face changed from heartbreak and\
  \ longing to joy as he talked about seeing all of the US, a feat he never thought\
  \ he would have the chance to achieve; he glowed as he talked about his daughter,\
  \ boasting about her premier test scores and beaming about her athletic achievements.\
  \ He even swore she was a female Mozart.\n\nFinally, as the dusty blue from the\
  \ last rays of day faded into a star scattered black, we reach Larimer. We parked\
  \ under the fluorescent lights and tall ceilings of a classic country truck stop.\
  \ Smiling at Remi, we wrapped our arms around him, grateful not only for the ride\
  \ but the stories and the friendship.  Smiling as we walked away, Noah waved with\
  \ his full arm, and thanked Remi again from being such a kind man as Remi jumped\
  \ into the Truck.  His last words have always stuck with me.\n\n\u201CI am not a\
  \ kind man, I am just a human.\u201D\n\nI thought that adventure was mutually exclusive\
  \ to foreign lands, to plane tickets and nights in Parisian hostels. However, one\
  \ day in a truck in the middle of \u201Cnothing\u201D USA showed me that just being\
  \ human is a journey in itself.  I had been around the globe and back, but I didn't\
  \ expected to find that adventure is right outside my door."
