Text: "Me, alone, in the middle of the night, disoriented.\nI was standing up in a\
  \ narrow alley in an artistic suburb of Melbourne. Last tram lost. The metro wasn't\
  \ working. Taxi?! \nToo expensive in the cosmopolitan city. \nI looked up at the\
  \ stars, the air was warm, it was the end of a really hot summer, two years ago.\
  \ \nI'd surely panicking, if I were out in another place, alone. But not there,\
  \ in Melbourne.Since my first day there, \nI had never felt in danger. \nThe city\
  \ is very big and busy; one of the main road is Swanston road: walking down that\
  \ street, it's like taking a trip all around the world...It is full of different\
  \ restaurants, smells of spices, people selling artesanal objects, a mix of languages,\
  \ music, people, eyes.\nNeither the high and grey buildings, neither the big roads,\
  \ neither the quantity of people living there, made me feel to be in such a big\
  \ city. The people were always taking care about the others and about the environment\
  \ around them, they were really open-minded and helpful. For this reason I'd never\
  \ felt in danger or isolated; neither in that warm and silent night, lost in unknown\
  \ roads of that suburb. This relaxed environment make people happy, so make people\
  \ more friendly too, not worried about protect themselves.\nI was relax too, I found\
  \ my balance there: I needed to cross the ocean to find myself, my shape...To understand\
  \ how to go with flow of that wavy and bubbly life. It was totally unexpected.\n\
  I didn't expect neither to find the love in Australia. One year before I never imagined\
  \ myself travelling by a van on my way to Wilson Promontory, a beautiful natural\
  \ park, 4 hours faraway from the city, with a chilean boy speaking about myself\
  \ and expressing all that I always kept in silence. Amazing! Even more if I think\
  \ that before of that casual meeting with Ronald, i didn't even know where it could\
  \ be Chile on a world map.\nThen, during one of many events I used to join, I was\
  \ waiting for my beer. I was smiling and I felt comfortable in that international\
  \ atmosphere, when Katia suddenly appeared. I approach her for asking her name and\
  \ I saw the adhesive flag on her shirt: Chilean. Such a coincidence! \nThat night\
  \ was born our grorup of friends. We always organized parties, we travelled all\
  \ together camping on the way, making a barbecue in the night in a car park, lost\
  \ like usual in the middle of nothing. Just us and our complicity. Different people\
  \ from different countries, but united by the same dream: travel around the world,\
  \ enjoying our life, collecting funny moments, living day by day, sharing with the\
  \ others. In that place, in that moment of my life, with that amazing people, I\
  \ felt free to be the real Giulia.\nI was discovering the real me while discovering\
  \ that impressive city. I often took some walks alone, trying to connect with the\
  \ surrounding, with my body, taking a break, reordering my thoughts, reconsidering\
  \ my experirnce. Melbourne has many green park. But the \"Royal botanical garden\"\
  \ was special to me. Imagine many flowers, plants of different origins, a little\
  \ lake, colorful birds. The magic of the that natural spot when the sun was going\
  \ down...Then suddenly the biggest bat i've never seen, appeared above my head.\
  \ Another time lost, inside tha park, every doors closed, except one. Lost but happy,\
  \ lost in my happiness. Happiness which was the source of my positive energy, that\
  \ would let me feel comfortable in many situations, supported by a community, and\
  \ by my friends. \nHappy in the happy island. I was sitting in the garden of my\
  \ house, in front of a quiet street. I used to live in Preston, a residencial area,\
  \ and I was au-pairing in a family with two little and very active, artistic childreen.\
  \ \nThey were sleeping finally and i I could enjoy my free time reading a book.\
  \ It was sunny outside.\nSuddenly a rare feeling, I remember clear as day: that\
  \ was my place in the world. I didn't expect to find it.\nMelbourne, the place to\
  \ be."
