Text: "The first time I heard of the Mandangin Island, my head spin to every direction.\
  \ \u201CI have to go there!\u201D I said to myself. So curious, I searched it on\
  \ Google. But so little I found, seems that this Island is rarely visited by travelers.\n\
  \nWell, that\u2019s good. I\u2019d be the first traveler to witness its beauty and\
  \ to share. \n\nSuramadu Bridge marked my journey, a 5.4 km long bridge that connects\
  \ Surabaya City to the Island of Madura to the north. Then continue Madura overland\
  \ for about 2 hours until I reached Sampang Town.\n\nThe maps say that a small port\
  \ is somewhere in Sampang, but I saw no port. So I continued blindly. A couple of\
  \ time I asked the residents about this port. They all said I missed it, damn!\n\
  \nI had my suspicious to boats lining up on the small river under a bridge I passed\
  \ a couple of time. I approached, and I find this place to be the port I was looking\
  \ for. \n\nA question remains in my mind, how could this be called a port? It doesn\u2019\
  t have a signboard, and worse, it\u2019s on a river bank. No one will, literally,\
  \ think that it\u2019s a port.\n\nWhile I waited for the boat to depart, someone\
  \ asked: \u201CWhere are you going?\u201D I said \u201CTo Mandangin Island\u201D\
  \n\nAnd he asked again \u201CDo you have any friends or relatives living on the\
  \ Island?\u201D \u201CNo\u201D I replied.\n\n\u201CSo where are you going to spend\
  \ the night?\u201D He continued his investigation. Then I said \u201CI don\u2019\
  t know\u201D\n\nI always prepared my small tent for such journey. I guess I needed\
  \ no worry about spending the night camping on the beach.\n\n\u201CWhy don\u2019\
  t you stay at my house?\u201D someone suddenly replied to the awkward moment I just\
  \ created seconds ago. His name is Mr. Ali. He was born and raised on Mandangin\
  \ Island, an Island native.\n\nSo I said \u201CYes please\u201D\n\nWe arrived on\
  \ the Island when the sun has already gone, leaving a golden light on the western\
  \ horizon. The Island is not really small though, and there are dense houses on\
  \ the north.\n\nI was warmly welcomed by Mr. Ali\u2019s mother. She even prepared\
  \ a local dish for dinner, as if she knew she would have a guess. But she could\
  \ only speak Madurese, I had difficulty talking to Mr. Ali\u2019s mother, even to\
  \ say \u201CThank You\u201D\n\nI asked Mr. Ali \u201CWhy did you offer me a place\
  \ to stay?\u201D I was a total stranger, and he\u2019s willing to help, I was curious.\n\
  \nHe said \u201CI remember my youth time when I see you. You see, I was like you,\
  \ love to wander around\u201D\n\n\u201COnce, I went to Barong Island on the south,\
  \ no one lived there. And once I stepped off the boat, I saw snake tracks on the\
  \ sand. They were as big as my lap. I was scared, but I managed to stay there for\
  \ 3 days\u201D He said again.\n\n\u201CAt other time, I went to Jakarta. At the\
  \ port, I met someone. He said he would take me sailing to West Papua and would\
  \ get me a job. So I joined. I went to West Papua without too much thinking. Just\
  \ go with the flow\u201D He continued his nostalgic story.\n\nI just listened and\
  \ imagine what he was saying. West Papua is very far, going to Singapore is so much\
  \ closer than to Papua, the westernmost Island of Indonesia.\n\nIn the morning,\
  \ I saw a bunch of guys walking around the Island with drums and stereo speakers\
  \ installed on the front part of a tricycle. They sang Islamic poets of Shalawat.\
  \ It\u2019s a big celebration day on the Island, an Islamic Holiday. Children followed\
  \ the entourage cheerfully.\n\nI am glad to see such wonderful sight, nice and warm\
  \ people, a vibrant culture, and the best of all, a pristine tropical beach of Mandangin\
  \ Island."
