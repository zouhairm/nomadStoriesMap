Text: "What did you dream when you where a child? I\u2019ve almost forgotten until\
  \ everything crashed down\u2026\nI was lost. I didn\u2019t like my job, my relationship,\
  \ not even myself!\nBut there was something in there, like a cloud, and I just was\
  \ waiting for the sun to come out\u2026 \nAnd then, as magically as it can be, I\
  \ decided to stop everything, even being myself (or what I thought I was). And the\
  \ sun came out and cleared the sky.\nI just asked myself\u2026 What do I really\
  \ want?\nAs a child, I always was dreaming about meeting everybody around the world\u2026\
  \ find out these little places where life happens while you look at some monument\u2026\
  \ the special bread that child buy every morning near her house, the elders talking\
  \ around a tree, women trying to hairdress their children to school\u2026 This little\
  \ and amazing things\u2026 Being observer and part of it at the same time\u2026\n\
  And what was the biggest trip I always imagined, since I can\u2019t remember?\n\
  Australia was the answer.\nAnd then, as only faith can make us trust, I started\
  \ to look for options to be there\u2026 \nObviously my mind was used to \u201Cthe\
  \ known\u201D, and I needed time to beat around the bush while looking for the answer,\
  \ so I had to keep it quiet. But faster than I expected, all the pieces fitted!\n\
  But wait\u2026 they say it\u2019s the most isolated city in the world, are you sure?\
  \ Probably there\u2019s nothing to do there\u2026 my mind stroke back.\nYou know\
  \ what, I always can come back, I have nothing to lose. \nThanks I am so stubborn!\
  \ I can\u2019t tell how it happened, but I just know it did, because here I am,\
  \ in Perth, Western Australia.\nAnd I must say that not even in my best dreams,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t imagine how many marvelous things I would find here.\nWild and\
  \ great nature is just half an hour from the city. We\u2019re surrounded by mountains,\
  \ ocean, forests, outback\u2026 And I love it\u2026\nThe Valley of Giants, a walk\
  \ between eucalyptus trees and beautiful birds.\nThe waves\u2026 oh my goodness\u2026\
  \ perfect for surfing and kitesurfing\u2026 or just watching and relax.\nThe very\
  \ south\u2026 with this pure clear water, that it\u2019s not even salted\u2026 And\
  \ its beaches in Esperance, Denmark, Albany\u2026\nThe white sand, daughter of quartz\
  \ mountains\u2026\nAnd the best, the night sky\u2026 An amazing spectacle you can\
  \ watch even in the suburbs. But when you\u2019re in the desert, oh my Goodness,\
  \ you can really feel we belong to something bigger\u2026 A family around the world,\
  \ people you meet in your own way, to share with, to live with, to love to\u2026\
  \ What a weird and amazing feeling, to live so intensively, squeezing every second,\
  \ because we all know sooner or later our ways will split up. And it makes it even\
  \ more beautiful.\nThis adventure is not just outside\u2026 It\u2019s inside ourselves,\
  \ we can find what we really want, what we really love, who we really are\u2026\n\
  Come and join the Journey!"
