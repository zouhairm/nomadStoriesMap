Text: "MY  LIFE EXPERIENCES\nMy name is Yunusa Jobe and I am currently working As\
  \ a Food and Beverages Attendant at Sheraton Jumeirah Beach Resort, Dubai (United\
  \ Arab Emirates). I feel so grateful and honored to write about my educational and\
  \ life experiences after going through tough situations in life. Undeniably, I believe\
  \ there are many people in the world that are in the same situation as me having\
  \ gone through a hard time to survive, I would say it is fortune and hope that brings\
  \ me to this life stage. Looking back over the years, I have many happy memories,\
  \ many regrets and many hard learned lessons that I believe have tough me to be\
  \ a more mature, sensible, strong-will and lively person. I attended My Studies\
  \ Reign through from nursery to Primary, High School to Hotel School. My parents\
  \ never wanted me to be changing schools unlike other children because they knew\
  \ that the school was among the best. In each of the classes I passed through, I\
  \ was always referred to as the most Diligent and Intelligent Student in class by\
  \ both teachers and classmates. Due to my parents protective nature, like I was\
  \ pretty much kept indoors, wasn\u2019t given access or allowed to have contact\
  \ with other people, I believe that I was always the shy type.\nMy main priority\
  \ was to score good marks and always be above the average mark. Due to my hardworking\
  \ and disciplinary behavior which was even noticed by the principal, I was once\
  \ sent to attend a scholarship program that was held by the Banjul City Council\
  \ in which I was awarded a one year scholarship .Apart from that I was also a member\
  \ Socialable clubs Activities Which Enhance my Communication Technique. I remembered\
  \ bringing my results home with first position in class, my dad would shout at me\
  \ and say I was stupid that how could I fail math and still get first position.\
  \ He was always complaining about it. I tried making efforts but still it wasn\u2019\
  t satisfactory. History classes were also very enjoyable and interesting. There\
  \ was much competition between us and the boys on questions raised on American history,\
  \ on certain topics such as the cold war, the bomb in 1920s, the Presidents and\
  \ their foreign policies etc. \"As the world becomes more intimately connected and\
  \ inter-dependant as a consequence of globalization, a solid grounding in the discipline\
  \ of international relations is vital for anyone who wants to look behind the headlines\
  \ and explore the key players in world politics.\nI have always been curious about\
  \ global affairs and passionate about finding ways to resolve international conflict,\
  \ terrorism, nuclear proliferation and third world debt. It was high school that\
  \ I first became keen on this area of study; I had a really passionate teacher who\
  \ aroused my interest in different political systems and the relationship between\
  \ countries. This tutor took an intimate interest in the advancement of my abilities\
  \ and greatly helped me to improve my essay writing skills, public speaking and\
  \ ability to work productively. My enthusiasm was further increased when I discovered\
  \ that there are many interesting careers open to graduates of international relations,\
  \ especially involving overseas travel which is something I greatly enjoy.\nEven\
  \ though I find this constantly evolving subject to be rigorous and demanding I\
  \ feel all of the effort is worthwhile as it is a very interesting topic that has\
  \ given me a much better understanding of how the world in which we live works.\
  \ I really enjoy the dynamic nature of studying Politics and International Relations\
  \ and am particularly keen on researching European Union integration, territorial\
  \ politics and nationalism. I am confident that your course will equip me with the\
  \ analytical research skills required for studying processes and factors in international\
  \ and transnational relations. It will also give me a clear understanding of organizations\
  \ such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), the United Nations (UN) and the European\
  \ Union (EU). These are all skills and knowledge that will help me gain a foothold\
  \ in any future careers in areas such as the diplomatic corps, politics and government,\
  \ journalism, charity work, relief and humanitarian work, the United Nations and\
  \ international business."
