Text: "The country of hot air and ardent people met a simple family in August three\
  \ years ago. Typical rest were planned for usual people when we walked down the\
  \ steps in the main airport \u201CFiumicino\u201D, holding small hand luggage. We\
  \ were going to the city in the opposite part of Italy. Long way made us feel tired\
  \ but ready for adventure in unknown reality. The streets with bright lights stretched\
  \ under tires of a bus. We drank coffee listening to dialects which my family had\
  \ not heart before and enjoyed well-deserved travelling. We went to our apartments\
  \ at midnight and fell asleep as fast as we could after a long way.\nNext morning\
  \ met us with silence on the streets in Pescara at six a.m. We spent our vacation\
  \ like those people who forgot about anything. Having walked at ten p.m. my father\
  \ looked around, noticing everything new. When mother was sleeping in the room he\
  \ commented opened doors of pizzerias with tasty smell of fresh dinner. Mommy woke\
  \ up and wanted to buy anything to have a snack, and the pizzeria was closed.\n\
  I eyed three-day fair with noisy cellars of the glass trinkets; however, when we\
  \ decided to buy a present for our mum the emptiness on the streets surprised us.\
  \ The weather was as sultry as magma. The big scoops of ice cream attracted us every\
  \ day, but ice-cream store was closed for us in time of siesta. Sometimes we stay\
  \ hungry or didn\u2019t have time to reserve a table in full restaurant of guests\
  \ in the evening. It surprised us. We were having supper on the beach. Looking at\
  \ wedding we chewed bread with tomatoes. It smelt like child hood and freedom. And\
  \ every day we did our routine according to schedule but not on time.\n\nBefore\
  \ departure the winds of love turned me and father out of the house in the night.\
  \ We strolled about the streets together while mom was sleeping before long flight\
  \ to the native country. I gaped at having cheered crowd of people on the bridge\
  \ and a lot of locks hung. My father stopped next to the one and took it in hands.\
  \ The lock was closed. \n\u201CDo you know what it is?\u201D he whisper in my ear.\
  \ The crowd was loudly laughing. There's no getting away from it. \nI cried that\
  \ we had on our cities\u2019 bridges the same but I didn\u2019t know wherefore people\
  \ had done it. There always were two names on the any padlock. Suddenly the noise\
  \ disappeared and we saw an old man, crossing the bridge. He stopped next to us\
  \ heavy breathing. \n\u201CDear,\u201D my father nudged me to him.  \u201CAsk him\
  \ what it means.\u201D\nFeeling shy I went to the old man and stated clumsily our\
  \ dialogue. He made a deep breathe and drew himself up.\n\u201COh! It\u2019s simple,\u201D\
  \ said the stranger. \u201CWhen Federico Moccia wrote his first book about fifteen\
  \ years ago we had a fever of adults who tried to lock their love. Lads and lassies\
  \ hung up locks on every street lamp in Rome, so they became crooked under the weight\
  \ of padlocks,\u201D explained he laughing. \u201CTime passed and they don\u2019\
  t do it anymore, and one lock sometimes is being closed on this bridge,\u201D nodded\
  \ the old man with smile.\nWe did not have a time to give him gratitude. He continued\
  \ his way. My father shrugged his shoulders and set the lock free. \u201CIf I had\
  \ locked my love to you mother,\u201D said he returning to our apartments, \u201C\
  We would have never been together for such a long time. It\u2019s like a prison.\
  \ If I cut wings of bird I\u2019ll see only a safer of it. If I love I\u2019ll let\
  \ it go anywhere.\u201D\nWe proceed along the path and returned to our apartments.\
  \ Our mother had been sleeping for a long time. My father kissed her at the forehead\
  \ and went to another bad in the corner.\nThe padlock on the bridge fell down."
