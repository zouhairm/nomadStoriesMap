Text: "Ever since I was a little girl, I have loved everything to do with the UK and\
  \ Ireland. I don't exactly remember my first introduction to these magical and green\
  \ lands but that is how steadfast their impression has been on me. I guess I'll\
  \ say the earliest that I remember is when a family friend visited Ireland and brought\
  \ me back a Penny Whistle and a small Celtic-style ring. From that time on, I have\
  \ been an absolute Anglophile! \nThis is not to say that I wouldn't love to see\
  \ more places in the world. In fact, I would love to add to the list of places I\
  \ have been already, and even go back to those places as well! My first real exposure\
  \ to travel in general was when I went to Spain with my Language Club in high school,\
  \ and two years later visiting Costa Rica with this same group. But the trip that\
  \ really transformed me since becoming an adult was the one in which I went to Ireland\
  \ for the first time.\nMy dad took me to The Emerald Isle for my 21st birthday and\
  \ forever changed my life. I will never forget (mostly because I am still going\
  \ through it) the feeling of homesickness that I got for Ireland, after being there\
  \ for only five days! As introverted and laid back as I am, I still face the feeling\
  \ of restlessness that I know my fellow nomads also feel when in one place for too\
  \ long. But Ireland. I could see myself being content with staying in Ireland for\
  \ a very long time without much protest, if any. \nI was worried that the Ireland\
  \ I had idealized and fluffed up in my imagination would cause the 'real deal' to\
  \ shatter my love of that place. Suffice it to say that the Real Ireland met my\
  \ expectations and then exceeded them five times over! \nThe people that I encountered\
  \ were so very nice and welcoming and the local cuisine is superb and the landscapes\
  \ speak for themselves. The rich history of Ireland has lasted through thousands\
  \ of years and much of its history is impeccably preserved in the iconic stone and\
  \ rock walls, cliffs, and castles laden throughout this green and mossy gem in the\
  \ middle of the Atlantic. \nI recently went back to Ireland with similar fears as\
  \ the first time I went: Will my rose colored glasses finally shatter and make me\
  \ view Ireland from a grayer lens? Again, Ireland did not disappoint, even as my\
  \ grandma and I navigated the roads on our own in a tiny rented red compact car.\
  \ The frustration of having to follow a paper map, from B&B to B&B and landmark\
  \ to landmark, could not take away from the exhilaration and sincere contentedness\
  \ I felt when I was there. \nMy soul and heart feel most at home when I am planning\
  \ a trip to Ireland, and when I'm flying into Dublin International, and when I am\
  \ sitting in Murphy's Pub in Killarney, and when I am at home in the U.S. daydreaming\
  \ about all of the above. \nI have not given up on my ultimate dream of living in\
  \ Ireland, whether for 6 months or 6 years. But until then I rest easily knowing\
  \ I can close my eyes at any time and picture my soul at home in Ireland."
