Text: "Hello! I am Lubna. I love to travel because it gives me pleasure, satisfaction,\
  \ inner peace and is a refreshment to my mind and soul. As I was grown up in a small\
  \ village located in the extreme north of Pakistan and the region is famous for\
  \ its large mountains and natural beauty. I have great experience of traveling in\
  \ these mountains and feel close to Mother Nature.\nEver since I was a child, I\
  \ had a sense of adventure; I just walked to the river through a small trail that\
  \ is flowing across my village, to see what was there, was exciting. I enjoy hiked\
  \ to the mountains with my friends and when I reached on the top of the mountain,\
  \ I feel like, I am on top of the world.\n I also like to travel writing to describe\
  \ the magic of travel. Traveling diary is one of the best ways to write the memories\
  \ of my wanderlust.it reminds of my thrilling adventures and moments of discovering\
  \ a new land, new culture, and new languages. The joy of my life comes from the\
  \ encounter of new experiences in life and tells about these experiences to the\
  \ world in a great piece of writing. Here is my story of the trip to Naltar valley.\n\
  Last summer\u2019s I made a plan to visit Naltar Valley.it lies 40 km away from\
  \ Gilgit city. The valley is known for its spell-bound beauty and its three lakes.\
  \ It is also an international ski spot in winters.\nOn one fine morning, I set out\
  \ my journey to Naltar. I took a jeep ride as the road is bumpy and arduous, and\
  \ reached Naltar bala at one pm. It is truly a magnificent place, its scenic beauty\
  \ is breathtaking, the area is covered with forests and its landscape is delightful\
  \ to eyes. I did lunch and started a journey towards the first lake on Pajero, I\
  \ reached at Satrangi Lake at two pm and it was surreal and hard to believe that\
  \ a lake could reflect as many colors. True to its name which means seven coloreds,\
  \ the most prominent colors were blue, green and surprisingly, yellow, a color I\
  \ had never seen before in a lake. The calm, peaceful water lay still as the underwater\
  \ plants particularly algae provided more color from under the primeval water surface.\n\
  After spending some good time just relaxing and admiring this marvel of nature,\
  \ I moved to the second lake, a fifteen minutes\u2019 drive away.\nThe Pari Lake\
  \ was entirely different, conversely larger than the Satrangi Lake; this gorgeous\
  \ alpine lake contained deep blue water sourced from natural springs and glacial\
  \ melts. Boating on a locally manufactured drift, I was informed by the skipper\
  \ that the water enters the lake from underground and there is no stream or river\
  \ above the lake which feeds water into it. \nAlthough the two of these lakes were\
  \ reachable through a jeep, the third one was not. It was on a hike of thirty-five\
  \ minutes, therefore I move on in search of the third lake.  \nAway from the Pari\
  \ Lake, I started my journey along the mountain, walking over massive rocks. After\
  \ ten minutes of walk, I arrived what seemed to be an enormous plain area.\nSuddenly\
  \ my surroundings were completely changed. The lush green carpet of summer grass\
  \ could be seen enlarging far and wide with a river flowing in between and streams\
  \ coming down from the mountain slopes on either side.\nClimbing slowly again, higher\
  \ up from the elevation down to my right, I arrived at the most beautiful lake I\
  \ had ever seen \nSpending another twenty minutes, I sat at a point above the Firoza\
  \ Lake, finding a magnificent panoramic view consisting of the lake, the river and\
  \ azure sky with gigantic, fluffy clouds. Soon enough, it was time to say goodbye\
  \ to these wonderful lakes as I proceeded back to my hotel and arrived before sunset.\
  \ Take some rest and saw the picture I had taken today just to confirm that those\
  \ beautiful lakes are real it wasn\u2019t a dream.\nIt\u2019s a worth taking journey,\
  \ although I hear about its beauty, I don\u2019t expect to find that its heaven\
  \ on earth."
