Text: "Probably this is not a story of a particular trip, but it\u2019s the story\
  \ of the trip of my life ... For travelers there\u2019s the question: Now where\
  \ are you going? Why are you leaving? You are not happy with what you have here?\
  \ And of course it fills you with feeling to leave your loved ones and all the comforts\
  \ but nothing like the sadness and frustration of feeling stuck, frustrated or leaving\
  \ in the imagination our life in another place, in another city, country, with another\
  \ job and different people.\n\nNobody said it would be easy, it\u2019s an act of\
  \ tremendous courage to make the leap into the unknown, but there is no way to take\
  \ on that pain and make it the motivation to start a new journey, it is necessary\
  \ to know other cultures, other mentalities, other lifestyles and to experiment\
  \ to the maximum, because only then I will know what is the place, the people, the\
  \ work and the life that I really want to live, I want to create my own life and\
  \ not settle for the life that \"I had to live\".\n\nI know so little about the\
  \ world that I want to know more, but I do not want to be told, I want to experience\
  \ it and I want to share my own anecdotes and experiences, I know I have seen only\
  \ a small proportion of what this world is but the more I see the greater are my\
  \ yearning to know every corner.\n\nDo we want to be a dreamer or an aspiring dreamer?\
  \ Dreams are only dreams until we make them come true. The excuses will always exist\
  \ and we will never stop using them, but let us not be the impediment to be completely\
  \ happy, we deserve that happiness in this fleeting life.\n\n\nJust imagine waking\
  \ up every day and feel peace with yourself, feel the emotion of what you live and\
  \ what remains to be discovered, repeat at every opportunity \"worth fighting for\
  \ what is worth having\", do not forget especially the humility and leave prejudices\
  \ aside, be open minded and give us the opportunity to integrate into the local\
  \ of each city, I think that is the most satisfactory, not only is it to say \"\
  I was there\" but \"I was part of ...\"\n\n\nI did\u2019t believe in what they say,\
  \ that the same person does not return from a trip but I have experienced it, every\
  \ time I try to be a better version of myself, which has involved living difficult\
  \ moments but each one has been worth it, I have lost myself, I fell in love, I\
  \ got drunk but above all I met.\n\nThe perfect time to start does not exist, you\
  \ will never be 100% prepared to dare, to launch, learn to live and improve based\
  \ on experience and not based on a belief, because we will always be criticized,\
  \ it is sad to think of all people who live repressed for not having the initiative\
  \ to take the first step. But you, do you want to be one of the bunch? Not me, and\
  \ that's why I'm here trying to have the place to develop both professionally and\
  \ personally in this World Nomads project, to demonstrate what I am and what we\
  \ can become together."
