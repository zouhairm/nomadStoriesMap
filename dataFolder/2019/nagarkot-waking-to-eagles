Text: "A soccer kick to my hostel door precedes my intruder\u2019s entrance. A wiry\
  \ guard in olive green, military visor cap two sizes too big, frog-marches me out\
  \ of my cell-like room outside into the dark. My Casio glows 5 am. He points to\
  \ a wooden chair on a concrete slab barely visible by the dim light from a candle\
  \ in his gloved hand, tosses me a musty wool blanket, balances a steaming cup of\
  \ chai on my knee and then vanishes into the ink of pre-dawn. Darkness mirroring\
  \ my state of mind, I imagine for a moment I\u2019ve been kidnapped by Maoist guerillas,\
  \ but the scent of green cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon bleeds all macabre from\
  \ the scene. Instead, the irony of my reality seeps in. I\u2019d come to Nepal looking\
  \ for answers. I wanted\u2026 more. Yet here I am, figuratively and literally in\
  \ the dark. Then, imperceptibly, darkness yields to dawn. The Annapurna Range rises\
  \ out of the dark with such proximity and ferocity it feels as if I\u2019ve opened\
  \ my eyes in the middle of the ocean just in time to see an episodic wave materialize\
  \ in slow motion mere seconds before it smashes me into a million pieces. As this\
  \ backdrop forms, Himalayan golden eagles morph out of rocks, gliding in on beams\
  \ of light, soaring and diving with a power and grace that leaves vapor from snow-covered\
  \ peaks vibrating in their wake. Gold morning mist transforms into cold, clear blue\
  \ and I realize I\u2019ve been crying. \n\nHe returns, pushing a plastic bag steaming\
  \ of dough, molasses and sesame seeds against my chest. He enunciates slowly, \u201C\
  Yomari. Go share yomari.\u201D  \nUnsure of where to go I watch the eagles soaring\
  \ south toward Kathmandu Valley. I decide to follow. I hike for two hours, 7,136\
  \ feet higher than my home in San Francisco when I come across a dilapidated shack.\
  \ I crouch before a dusty sliding glass window and flash a grin and my yomari to\
  \ the middle-aged man inside. He smiles, waves me around back, pulls up two tree\
  \ stumps and pours us chai. We eat our yomari in silence, gazing upward at eagles\
  \ skywriting secrets on indigo tapestry, smiling our contentment. He tells me about\
  \ the Bengal tigers that once ruled these parts and the ragged Maoist guerrillas\
  \ who wander out of the jungle seeking food and donations. He tells me about the\
  \ eagles, how they can look directly into the sun. As a test of their young, eagles\
  \ hold their fledglings up toward the sun. If a fledgling turns his eyes away, he\u2019\
  s cast out of the nest. He opens a worn map and suggests a trek. I ask how long.\
  \ \nSquinting, he says, \u201CFour, maybe five weeks.\u201D \nI recoil in shock\u2026\
  I have only three days. He laughs, then becomes very still. \nAfter a long pause,\
  \ he holds my gaze and says, \u201CIn three days, you may see mountains, but you\
  \ will learn nothing.\u201D \nBy afternoon, we\u2019ve put a major dent in his stash\
  \ of homemade raksi, a clear distilled millet moonshine that burns the throat but\
  \ warms the soul.  As the sun descends, we hug and bid our farewells. \n\nI arrive\
  \ back at the Inn, glowing and out of breath. The guard\u2019s there waiting. \n\
  \u201CGood day?\u201D he asks quietly. \n\u201CYes, amazing!\u201D  \n\u201CGood\
  \ sunrise?\u201D\n\u201CI will never forget it.\u201D \n \u201CGood yomari?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CYomari made today possible. Thank you.\u201D\n\u201CMy name is Ujesh,\u201D\
  \ he whispers, placing his palm over my heart. \u201CRemember, there is always,\
  \ always enough.\u201D\n\nDays later, I relay my experience to Olga, a local acquaintance\
  \ who founded an orphanage in Kathmandu. At dusk, sipping coffee on a balcony overlooking\
  \ the city, we talk about the indelible power of sunrise over the Annapurna, the\
  \ magic of golden eagles, of yomari and raksi. I tell her about Ujesh and his final\
  \ words of wisdom.  \nAfter a moment of reflection, she says, \u201CUjesh lived\
  \ up to his name.\u201D  \n\u201CYou know him?\u201D I exclaim.  \nOlga smiles,\
  \ \u201CNo, just his name, Ujesh, in Nepali: it means \u2018the one who brings light\u2019\
  .\u201D  \nOlga leaves but I stay, watching the city neon attempting to impress.\
  \ \n\u201CThere is always enough,\u201D I whisper. I vow tomorrow morning, to stare\
  \ straight into the sun."
