Text: "Despite it being the middle of July, the weather was mild: not the Italian\
  \ summer heat I had expected. The sun jumped from hill to hill, as our red car was\
  \ blasting down the mountain road. When I hung out to capture the sunset melting\
  \ over the valley, the Italian-style flirty wind swooped in on me and started playing\
  \ with my hair. Like teasing a nearby windmill wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 he wanted\
  \ to make both our heads spinning.\n\nWhen Andrea told me there would be a celebration\
  \ in a nearby village and asked if I wanted to come, I didn\u2019t think twice.\
  \ While in Matera, I wanted to learn as much as possible about that part of Italy,\
  \ and more so about all the initiatives of that man, which he had many. Being a\
  \ founder of Casa Netural, a coliving I came to live in, Andrea managed to organize\
  \ immense local events and cultural projects. His dedication appeared even in the\
  \ smallest details: the tomato paste offered to Casa\u2019s guests was a tribute\
  \ to local producers he supported. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find out\
  \ he had been the one behind UNESCO\u2019s announcing Matera the 2019 European capital\
  \ of culture \u2014 he seemed to be doing that much for the region. Or actually,\
  \ I would. I saw how moved the people around were by the single man\u2019s actions,\
  \ but was still wondering: how much impact could they really have?\n\nWhat was supposed\
  \ to be a village ended up to be a half-abandoned town called Grottole, with only\
  \ 2000 people of registered population and God knows how many actual dwellers, since\
  \ the youngsters fled to bigger cities in pursuit of a better life. Except for the\
  \ very few, and one of them, Vincenzo, I met that day.\n\u2014 Can I use your phone\
  \ camera? Mine is broken.\nWhat kind of traveler I am, you might ask, yet there\
  \ I was \u2014 using my selfie camera to take pictures. Not of me, very funny. While\
  \ the trick worked unexpectedly well on sneaking a peek at locals or capturing the\
  \ beauty from underneath of a cathedral\u2019s dome \u2014 you should try it sometime,\
  \ it really helps to find an unexpected angle, literally \u2014 it was torture when\
  \ I needed some ordinary shots.\n\u2014 Sure, keep it till the end of the walk.\n\
  His phone wasn\u2019t the only thing he was willing to share with me. During the\
  \ impromptu excursion Andrea organized for the group, which apart from me consisted\
  \ entirely of Italians he invited, Vincenzo became my personal interpreter. It turned\
  \ out, he studied in English in Milan, and yet, unlike most of his peers, used to\
  \ come back home at the earliest opportunity to help his father make wine. Needless\
  \ to say, our excursion strayed from the main one, and he showed me the rest of\
  \ the town from his own eyes: his family's 18th-century granary, and the vineyard.\
  \ He was telling me tales, as we walked by a Roman temple and abandoned houses that\
  \ looked like a Middle Ages movie set. A perfect one for a heartbreaking story of\
  \ Abufina and Selepino. It turns out every Italian city, no matter how big or small,\
  \ has its own version of Romeo and Juliet. \n\n\u2014 It was so nice to meet you.\
  \ \nWhen it was time to say goodbye, he told me that he admired my bravery: a solo\
  \ traveler girl who goes wherever she wants.\n\u2014 I hope there are more people\
  \ like you in the world.\n\u2018No, I thought to myself, I hope there are more people\
  \ like you.\u2019\n\nHe didn\u2019t realize he already had what all travelers are\
  \ looking for. He was inspired by my freedom, while I fell in love with what he\
  \ and Andrea shared \u2014 a sense of commitment. He admired my vagabonding, while\
  \ I was admired by his belonging.\n\nSix months later he wrote to me with the news.\
  \ Andrea managed to partner with Airbnb to launch 'Italian Sabbatical': a project\
  \ where four people would get an all-expenses-paid summer in Grottole, learning\
  \ the language, the culture, and the craft of wine-making from Vincenzo\u2019s father.\
  \ 'What a great idea to promote the region!' I thought, and wasn't the only one.\
  \ They got more than 350,000 applications."
