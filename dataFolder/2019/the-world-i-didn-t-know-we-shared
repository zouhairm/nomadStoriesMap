Text: "The celestial Alpine mountains tower around me and the 700 inhabitants of Fl\xE4\
  sch, Switzerland. In stark contrast to the bustling streets of Madrid I\u2019m growing\
  \ accustomed to, the secluded village occupies its intimate corner of the Rhine\
  \ valley. Vibrant green vineyards stretch for miles in every direction and the jagged\
  \ mountain edges glow when the grey clouds expose flashes of sun. \n\nThe uneven,\
  \ narrow cobblestone streets are vacant. My parents and I are in front of Maria\
  \ Rohner\u2019s home, where my dad worked 33 years ago in her family's winery during\
  \ one of his German immersion experiences. I deeply inhale the crisp air, cleansing\
  \ my lungs infused with city pollution from my past six months teaching English\
  \ in Madrid. \n\nWe step inside Maria\u2019s home, a recently converted wine cellar,\
  \ now a contemporary two story loft that tastefully maintained its nearly 1000 year\
  \ history. My dad\u2019s former host mom is a smaller woman in her 70\u2019s with\
  \ short, styled grey hair wearing a white spring jacket and patterned red scarf;\
  \ my dad acknowledges how she looks the same. When she laughs, I see a flicker of\
  \ my own former host mom, Marta, from my semester studying in an equally majestic\
  \ town on the Northern Spanish coast. \n\nMy dad\u2019s memories of his experience,\
  \ apart from those that had only been triggered by photographs, become sharp once\
  \ again. I take pause realizing for the first time, though those photographs inspired\
  \ me to create my own adventures living in a non-English speaking country, I have\
  \ never heard him talk about the details of his experiences in Fl\xE4sch. \n\nWe\
  \ share a bottle of Rohner family wine as my dad recalls playing in the courtyard\
  \ with Maria\u2019s three children, and the time he continued to work with a broken\
  \ hand that was crushed by a wine crate. He reflects on spending his days harvesting\
  \ grapes in the vineyards under the autumn sun, climbing into the wine barrels to\
  \ clean them since only he could fit, and ending each of those days with a secret\
  \ Ritter chocolate bar the younger children couldn\u2019t have. \n\n\u201CIt really\
  \ was a wonderful experience,\u201D he beams at Maria.\n\nMy mom and I share a look\
  \ of astonishment, like we were living a memoir we had always known the title of\
  \ but never asked to read. Maria responds in awe of his exceptional memory of events\
  \ she recalls faintly. I imagine my future conversations with Marta going similarly,\
  \ about my obsession with going on runs to the lighthouse, el faro, my favorite\
  \ place in town, and always mixing it up with the Spanish word for seal, la foca.\
  \ \n\nSpending the day in the former cellar, my dad relives his 22 year old life\
  \ like no time has passed. Except now I'm 22 years old, and in that moment I become\
  \ acutely aware of the lifetime I spent craving a similar opportunity. Despite this\
  \ longing for a similar adventure, I feel a hint of guilt we never really talked\
  \ about his. \n\nWe share spectacularly rich conversation, Rohner family wine, and\
  \ never-ending hors d\u2019oeuvres. Before I know it, our glasses are empty. Maybe\
  \ it was just the wine, but as we clear the table, wet, hot tears fill my eyes.\
  \ We say our goodbyes, and my dad\u2019s younger spirit becomes a little less defined.\
  \ Maria waves outside the car window, and I see the identical image of Marta waving\
  \ goodbye two years ago as I left my semester with her. \n\nI ponder how my dad\
  \ kept his past world hidden so well, but my experiences will probably end up hidden\
  \ similarly. He couldn\u2019t have said anything to truly bring the photos of his\
  \ adventures to life before I had some of my own, and I know I\u2019ll feel that\
  \ way about mine too. Further, without expectations of how I\u2019d value my experience\
  \ based on how he valued his, my dad gave me the opportunity to discover the immeasurable\
  \ power of forming connections that transcend vast oceans and language barriers\
  \ for myself. \n\nWith that, we leave behind the day\u2019s memories with new photographs\
  \ and the unspoken acknowledgement that we know exactly how the other feels. The\
  \ Alps swallow the highway before us, and Fl\xE4sch disappears."
