Text: "We didn\u2019t plan our trip to Morocco thoroughly and I have to say, I liked\
  \ it more that way. Not having your hands tied up by an itinerary gives you freedom\
  \ to discover things you wouldn\u2019t be able to plan from home. I tried to speak\
  \ with the locals, soak up all the smells, the sounds from the street, memorize\
  \ all the splendid mosaics, colours, savour all the tastes. It was all wonderful,\
  \ miscellaneous, thrilling. However, there was something about Morocco that left\
  \ a certain bitterness inside of me. It was the people. Those that asked for a tip\
  \ after giving an advice, taxi drivers who tried to give us different prices than\
  \ locals get, kids who begged for money but refused our offer of ice cream. Luckily,\
  \ when you start losing hope in them, something always happens. Something that reassures\
  \ you that the world is still a good place. \n\nAt the end of this crazy ten days\
  \ road trip we found ourselves in Fez, the cultural capital of Morocco. As time\
  \ went by, I started feeling the need to say goodbye. To eat one last vegetable\
  \ tajine, to get lost in the medina once again or to bargain at the local market?\
  \ No, it had to be something special. Right at that moment, the perfect destination\
  \ to watch the sunset appeared in front of us. A steep hill covered by lush green\
  \ grass, shaded by trees, with a fortress rising on the top. As we started climbing\
  \ up we realized that this place was not a tourist attraction - it belonged to the\
  \ locals. Families having a picnic on the grass, kids playing games and running\
  \ around and couples admiring the romantic view. We joined them as we reached the\
  \ top. \u201CI can leave now,\u201D I thought to myself after having taken a deep\
  \ refreshing breath. Despite my goodbye, Morocco had one more experience planned\
  \ for us.  \n\nDescending down the hill, we caught the eye of one, little, Morrocan\
  \ boy. \u201CBonjour!\u201D he called  and a group of his friends had soon joined.\
  \ By this time, we had gotten quite used to being greeted by locals at every corner.\
  \ However, we hadn\u2019t expected them to approach us. In a second we found ourselves\
  \ surrounded by ten little boys. One of them shook my hand and told me in French\
  \ that they were eating tajine. Suddenly, I saw a sparkle in his eye. He said: \u201C\
  Mange, mange!\u201D which means eat in french and he ran to their spot under a tree.\
  \ He returned quickly with a huge tajine pot in his hands. I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ it, those boys wanted to share their traditional meal with us! \u201CMange, mange,\u201D\
  \ they kept yelling as one of them handed me a piece of bread dipped in tajine sauce.\
  \ There was no time to think, one simply couldn\u2019t say no to those eyes. I took\
  \ the bread, said \u201Cmerci\u201D and they couldn\u2019t stop smiling. That was\
  \ it. This small, simple act left me with a warm feeling in my heart and a smile\
  \ on my face for the rest of the trip. No matter the previous disappointments and\
  \ poor experiences, all that was wiped out by the memory of the happy faces of the\
  \ kids who had shared what little they had.     \n\nFor a while I thought of giving\
  \ them some money, but I gave up on this idea. I didn\u2019t want to ruin that moment\
  \ of pure generosity. I didn\u2019t want them to grow up into a generation which\
  \ sees tourists as nothing more than walking wallets. I really hope they never will."
