Text: "July 1989, in Death Valley's National Park, age 12 in a scolding 130 degrees.\
  \ There to battle my fear of heights, by repelling the immense drop of 700 feet\
  \ off the face of 68-year-old legendary Cyclops Canyon. It is mounded in the Funeral\
  \ Mountains in the Death Valley\u2019s bad water basin, the lowest elevation at\
  \ 282 feet below sea level in Southern California. From the ground to the peak it\
  \ stands 2000 feet. It was named Cyclops do to the central eye carved into the top,\
  \ where the nest of a bald eagle\u2019s eggs layed. The exhilarating feeling of\
  \ concouring my main fear at such a tender age gave me the confidence that I could\
  \ go and do anything. From there I was on my way to the immense Grand Canyon in\
  \ Arizona. The canyon displayed layers of red rock dating millions of years old.\
  \ No better way to explore this 277-mile area then ascension. I strongly advise\
  \ to do this by taking the helicopter ride around the rim of the canyon. Specifically,\
  \ when the Northern rim area is open, so you experience the canyon from rim to rim.\
  \ As 277- miles of The Colorado river runs through the canyon, water from seven\
  \ different states drain into both the big and little Colorado rivers displaying\
  \ this own turquoise spectrum of color. This cannot be done by foot, only by air.\
  \ If you want to observe the canyon in a whole, this is surly the way to go. Next\
  \ stop being Las Vegas boulevard also known as \u201CThe Strip\u201D in Nevada.\
  \ It is well known \u201CWhat happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas\u201D.          \
  \                                                   Being raised in the desert of\
  \ California, back to the narrow streets of Philadelphia, PA. The place of my birth\
  \ and the city I learn to love! Founded by William Penn in 1644 the largest city\
  \ in Pennsylvania. Once called \u201CThe City of Brotherly Love\u201D now renamed\
  \ \u201CThe City That Loves You Back\u201D do to the murder rate. A city 20 miles\
  \ from Philadelphia and 75% smaller, only being 6 miles long and 4 miles wide, is\
  \ Chester, Pennsylvania. Settled in 1644 and named \u201CUpland\u201D by the Swedish,\
  \ then renamed \u201CChester\u201D in 1682. Many do not know that off the Delaware\
  \ River sits Dock St. on the Eastside of Chester, that is where William Penn landed\
  \ for the first time in North America. It is the oldest city in Pennsylvania and\
  \ the murder capital of Pennsylvania. Also, the city I resided the last 30 years\
  \ of my life. Now 41 years of age, having a multitude of journeys across this great\
  \ land of the U.S.A. Holding on tight to my passport, anxious to travel this marvelous\
  \ world! While pursuing my passion for learning different regions culture, searching\
  \ for a posion as a travel blogger, only dreaming of being an actual travel writer.\
  \ I cannot think of anywhere better than the oldest nation-state in Europe. Making\
  \ Portugal the first stamp in that \u201CLittle Blue Book\u201D. Taking my life\
  \ adventure\u2019s from coast to coast to over the vast seven seas. Literally from\
  \ Sea to Shining Sea!"
