Text: "My name is Bernard Jonifani.  Born on the 29th of April 1988 in Bulawayo Zimbabwe.\
  \  \n\nI always knew at a tender age that I was different but I did not know how?\
  \ I knew that I wanted to be like any other person in my family but I could not\
  \ fit in. \n\nAt the tender age if 12 I had lost both my parents and could not afford\
  \ to go to school, but I knew that one day I will fight for my education and my\
  \ dignity.  My life in Zimbabwe was not just hard because of growing up without\
  \ parents but trying to accept my sexual orientation  (gay)  before trying to get\
  \ approved by my siblings or to be accepted if I can say, I found it hard to accept\
  \ that I was gay myself.  \n\nI then worked very hard to travel to our neighbouring\
  \ country South Africa as I heard that they have gay rights. At the age of 17 I\
  \ moved to Johannesburg South Africa where I found a job as a security guard which\
  \ is the easy job to find there as it is not a paying and unsafe job for a 17 year\
  \ old.  But I had to  do it to be able to support myself and my siblings.  At that\
  \ point I did not care for my feelings I cared more about the family I left back.\
  \ I traveled from Johannesburg, Durban, Cape town and Mpumalanga trying to seek\
  \ a better life. But I ended up back in Johannesburg. \n\nAt 29 i managed to take\
  \ myself to school now i am 30 and looking forward to writing my matric exams this\
  \ June 2019. The way I am hungry for education hurts so bad because I did not know\
  \ some people have chances and they do not even appreciate. Johannesburg is a busy\
  \ city it can either make one or break one. To me it did both to me. It gave me\
  \ an opportunity to study and better my life and my family.  Same time it's lifestyle\
  \ that is busy and buzzing at night left me with a stamp for life that we will discuss\
  \ in future. \n\nI came to South Africa for a better life but only found out it's\
  \ a country with more hate over foreign people especially us Zimbabwean as they\
  \ believe we come here to take their jobs and their women/men. I did not expect\
  \ to find so much hate and less love. But it is what it is. Not everyone has so\
  \ much hatred because I have found some love in many places here in South Africa.\
  \  \n\nBesides all that has or still happening in my life I still have  a dream\
  \ to travel and write and speak out about my experience. The world is a beutiful\
  \ place to be seen and experienced.  The boy in me is still curious to see what\
  \ is out there, how other people live from day to day. Travel Chanel built my curiosity\
  \ more."
