Text: "The heat is stifling and the humidity is making me sweat from places I didn\u2019\
  t even know possible.\_\_I am standing on a very familiar hill in the middle of\
  \ Broome that I had been to so many times before. It was right\_between a aboriginal\
  \ housing community and\_the fanciest hotel in town and the only thought I had given\
  \ this place previously,\_was why the developers hadn't moved in yet. While\_I\_\
  was slowly melting,\_a man quietly walks up to\_my\_group and introduces himself\
  \ as our guide. Bart Pigram wasn\u2019t loud or imposing but when he spoke,\_it\
  \ was passionate and inspiring and what this man would say over the next two hours\
  \ would have us hanging on his every word.\n\nAboriginal Australia gets a pretty\
  \ bad rap. There\u2019s not enough education in schools about the real history and\
  \ too much racist hatred floating around our communities. The social problems, alcohol\
  \ abuse and vagrancy everyday Australians and tourists see in our towns and cities\
  \ becomes an unspoken story about aboriginal culture and life.\n\nThe truth is,\
  \ it couldn\u2019t be\_farther\_from the real culture that I have come to know.\_\
  I've\_been privileged to learn from some amazing indigenous people in my time as\
  \ a guide and I make it my mission to educate as many people as possible about what\
  \ actually happened in 250 years of uninvited settlement, mistreatment and massacres.\
  \ Its a difficult story to tell because I lead an amazing life as a direct result\
  \ of everything that happened as of 1788. When people learn the truth though,\_\
  there becomes a certain amount of empathy and understanding about how we got to\
  \ the current situation that is so far from the 65,000 years of untouched culture\
  \ that seems almost lost now.\_\n\nBart, a proud Yarawu Aboriginal man, lead us\
  \ on a two hour tour walking tour over a 500m strip of town. Even in this small\
  \ area he shared so many stories of a time when his people would sit on this hill\
  \ and eat fresh seafood,\_looking out over the red pindan hills and turquoise oceans\
  \ of Roebuck Bay. Digging up artefacts in the sand,\_he told of the creation beings\
  \ that came through the area and created all that we could see, leaving them as\
  \ custodians to look after this beautiful country. He told the stories from ancestors\
  \ sitting upon that very hill,\_sighting the first Europeans coming into the area\
  \ and what happened to his proud and independent people over the following years\
  \ as their culture was corroded by alcohol and influence from these new intruders.\
  \ How they\_welcomed the intruders\_and even helped them survive in this harsh and\
  \ unforgiving land and how they were repaid with slave labour on pearling boats\
  \ and being relegated to the edges of town. Every bush we walked by he stopped and\
  \ shared knowledge on bush food, medicines and poisons. His connection with nature\
  \ and the area that he called home was so evident.\n\nAs we left that hill and headed\_\
  off\_to learn more about the indigenous contribution to Broome\u2019s pearling history,\
  \ Bart purposefully walked us past one of the aboriginal housing communities.\_\_\
  Old derelict housing, similar to housing of 3rd world countries, surrounded by million\
  \ dollar buildings with a view to die for over\_Roebuck Bay. It was clear these\
  \ people were getting in the way of development. Bart welcomed questions and spoke\
  \ nothing but well founded and thoroughly researched truths. We were building million\
  \ dollar lookouts right next to where they were sleeping in the\_dirt. As\_an Australian\
  \ I was embarrassed. It was incredible though, this man spoke with no other intention\
  \ than getting the truth out. He was an ambassador for his people and he was determined\
  \ to use his platform to change our view\_of\_their world.\n\nTwo\_hours went by\
  \ in such a blur. There was so much I didn\u2019t know about this town I had called\
  \ home for almost 2 years. So many things\_are\_wrong with our community,\_but there\
  \ was also so much hope with people like Bart standing up and taking charge of the\
  \ future of his people."
