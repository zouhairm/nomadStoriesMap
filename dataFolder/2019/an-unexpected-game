Text: "Who wouldn\u2019t feel uneasy entering the Red Zone in Colombia? My senses\
  \ were on high alert as I tried my hardest to appear calm each time another local\
  \ jumped onto the filthy, cramped bus. I had been warned about kidnaps by the paramilitaries.\
  \ \n\nCamila, who I had met in Paraguay, had assured me it would be safe to visit\
  \ her in her hometown of  Popay\xE1n, provided I didn\u2019t take the night bus.\
  \ She was keen to tell me about the reality as well as the scars left by the conflict\
  \ with the FARC. On this journey, my unrest was to be rewarded with the most serendipitous\
  \ experience.\n\nCamila's family had a lucky escape when the FARC stormed into their\
  \ house in the night some years ago. They were forced to move to another area, like\
  \ thousands of other displaced families, many of whom became homeless and lived\
  \ in poverty. Colombia\u2019s corrupt government had spent only a tiny fraction\
  \ of the promised budget to build soulless concrete terraced houses for these people\
  \ in the middle of nowhere. It resembled a concentration camp, with little opportunity\
  \ to escape from this new prison. \n\nCamila's family were lucky enough to be able\
  \ to start a new life in Popay\xE1n and her dad now worked as a rancher on a farm\
  \ 10 km from FARC zone. Given the family's past experiences, he had managed to strike\
  \ a mutually beneficial deal with the Army: he allowed a 20-man squad to live on\
  \ his extensive farmland in return for security. The Army also deployed hidden units\
  \ in sensitive areas to surprise the FARC if they attempted to intrude.\L\n\nSo\
  \ here I was, a backpacker armed with a frisbee, surrounded by 20 heavily-armed\
  \ teenage soldiers and their slightly cocky Lieutenant. They looked at me shyly\
  \ as I tried to work out how to break the ice. Fortunately, Camila helped me start\
  \ chatting to Juan, an 18-year-old cook. I asked him why he joined the Army. He\
  \ replied that his family was poor and the military paid better than many other\
  \ jobs. I suspected the answer was the same for all the young soldiers. Juan\u2019\
  s smile was contagious; he confessed it was the first time he had seen and talked\
  \ to a foreigner and couldn\u2019t wait to tell his family. I felt humbled.\n\n\
  Thirty minutes later we were patrolling the area. Four soldiers 20 meters ahead,\
  \ another four 20 meters to the rear\u2013all fully armed\u2013Camila and the Lieutenant\
  \ either side of me. The instructions were clear: keep your distance; in the event\
  \ of a grenade attack, only one of us dies. I wondered what my mother would say\
  \ if she knew. \n \nAs we walked, I heard many unsettling stories about the consequences\
  \ of the conflict. Also how President Uribe had compromised the fight by giving\
  \ civilians heavy weapons to defend themselves, giving birth to paramilitary groups.\L\
  \n\nBack at the farm, the curious soldiers finally started asking lots of questions\
  \ about me. Even the simplest answer would ignite a spark of excitement in their\
  \ eyes, making me feel humble again. \n\nAfter having dinner with them, the Lieutenant\
  \ asked about my frisbee. He then ordered the squad to make two teams and listen\
  \ to me explain the rules of \u2018ultimate frisbee\u2019. He wanted them to have\
  \ some fun, so, after a brief explanation there we were playing frisbee, surrounded\
  \ by cows, guys with machine guns and with the FARC 10 km away. As I jumped to grab\
  \ the frisbee with these young soldiers, I realized they were probably having more\
  \ fun than I ever would on my travels. Those 20 minutes will always stay in my heart,\
  \ and I hope in theirs too.\n\nOn the bus back to Bogota, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking\
  \ about what I had just experienced. I stared through the window at another displaced\
  \ families camp. The grey cloudy sky had somehow managed to blend with the dreary\
  \ colours of those concrete buildings. I watched the kids playing and wondered about\
  \ their chances in life. \n\nI looked at the frisbee. I felt like stopping the bus\
  \ and going to play with those kids. \n\nMy biggest regret is that I didn't."
