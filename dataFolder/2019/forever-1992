Text: "\u201CThey tried to take away our language, our heritage, our culture!\u201D\
  \n\nThe guide at the Memorial Museum of Bender\u2019s Tragedy is angry and expects\
  \ us to be. He looks from face to face and gets a few nods of sympathy, but no indignant\
  \ headshakes. A Moldovan in our group grows tense: she\u2019s one of \u201Cthem.\u201D\
  \n\nHere in Transnistria, an unrecognized state that broke away from Moldova two\
  \ decades ago, Moldovans aren\u2019t welcome. As a Ukrainian, I should be fine.\
  \ That\u2019s the only thing I knew two weeks ago, when I set out on a trip from\
  \ Kiev to Chi\u0219in\u0103u with a motley crew of Eastern Europeans. Cut off from\
  \ the outside world, not on the map, not in the news, Transnistria added an edge\
  \ to the itinerary. I was curious to see what a non-country looked like.  \n\nWhen\
  \ a busful of drowsy tourists trickle into the museum in Bender, I catch the first\
  \ glimpse.\n\n\u201CWe shall not be deprived of our history, name, mother tongue,\
  \ national culture,\u201D declare golden letters on a red wall. It\u2019s the mother\
  \ tongue Moldova and Transnistria clashed over in 1992. Chi\u0219in\u0103u recognized\
  \ Moldovan as a dialect of Romanian and switched back to the Latin script, wanting\
  \ to mend old ties with Romania and leave the Soviet past behind. But here in the\
  \ east the Russian language and the Cyrillic alphabet brought by the USSR were key\
  \ to one\u2019s identity. And from the looks of it, so was the Soviet past.\n\n\u201C\
  We defended our culture with glory here in Bender,\u201D the guide says, pointing\
  \ at a display of battle photos and newspaper clippings. He beams with pride, and\
  \ the hammer and sickle above his head beams as well. \n\nOutside the buildings\
  \ are perforated with bullets. Bender did fight for Transnistrian identity, albeit\
  \ an identity comprised of hammers and sickles and a brand of propaganda I recognize\
  \ right away. In the Battle for Bender in 1992 the rebels shot and died to keep\
  \ Moldovans off the bridge to Tiraspol, but it\u2019s 2014 now and no one tries\
  \ to stop our bus.\n\nWe find Tiraspol blindfolded with fog, but a rusty-brown Lenin\
  \ in the central square is gazing into it with confidence. The Lenin in my hometown\
  \ used to have the same look. The avenue that shoots in both directions from the\
  \ square is deserted, and the street advertising appears rudimentary. \u201CHome\
  \ Appliance Store,\u201D states a plain letter sign on a whitewashed building. No\
  \ brand, no logo. \u201CExcellent cash!\u201D and \u201CHappy birthday, Jesus Christ!\u201D\
  \ read two billboards opposite each other. I\u2019ve seen this rookie capitalism\
  \ before: in films about the post-Soviet 90s, in a history textbook, in the backgrounds\
  \ of black-and-white photos of me at age four. Ukraine has moved on since then,\
  \ but this place is trapped like a fly on a sticky strip.\n\n\u201COh look, my dad\
  \ used to keep nails and screws in a box like this!\u201D \n\nI\u2019m snatched\
  \ out of my thoughts by Katya, a new friend from the suburbs of Kiev, who\u2019\
  s holding a metal box with a brown-and-orange label. The label says \u201CIndian\
  \ Instant Coffee\u201D in a Hindi-styled font. We\u2019re at Sheriff, the bigger\
  \ of the two supermarket chains in Transnistria, and it\u2019s stocked with memorabilia\
  \ like coffee boxes from dads\u2019 garages. I hear \u201Coh look!\u201D and \u201C\
  wow!\u201D left and right as our group scatters among rows of red cigarette packs,\
  \ complete with hammer and sickles, and greenish bottles of Bouquet of Moldavia,\
  \ my grandma\u2019s favorite vermouth, and jars of black caviar, and more instant\
  \ coffee from India. Whatever was deemed a delicacy in the hungry 90s, it\u2019\
  s all here, all within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nAwed by the things we thought long gone,\
  \ we spend a good hour browsing. We read the labels our 20-something parents read,\
  \ touch the boxes they touched, smell the soap they smelled. As if the war has tampered\
  \ with the clock, leaving this quasi-country stuck in a Groundhog Day in 1992 \u2014\
  \ with no one to break the loop."
