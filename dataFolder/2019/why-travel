Text: "At 37 I am tired of bunk beds. This hostel is different in Florian\xF3polis,\
  \ however. It is more of a wellness center that caters to spiritual seekers, digital\
  \ nomads, and modern hippies. \n\nAfter the Family Dinner last night, one of the\
  \ founders of the hostel asked me a question I get all the time, \u201CWhy are you\
  \ traveling?\u201D Unlike others who ask the same question, this former Israeli\
  \ Navy Seal posed his question with a seriousness that caught me off guard. After\
  \ a rambling attempt at an answer, I felt unsure about my intentions and my purpose\
  \ for leaving my job, my girlfriend, my apartment, and my life back home in Brooklyn.\n\
  \nGrowing up in Central NJ, I didn\u2019t travel much. My family was middle class\
  \ and we didn\u2019t have the money to have summer vacations in Europe or take Caribbean\
  \ cruises. Despite this lack of moving far from my suburban environs, travel was\
  \ ever present in my mind. \n\nMy Dad traveled for work constantly. He regularly\
  \ had monthly business trips. I recall being so excited to get little tchotchkes\
  \ from his travels. A funny t-shirt from Singapore or a set of chopsticks from Japan\
  \ would arouse my imagination and deepen my connection to my father and the outside\
  \ world. \n\nI also was blessed with an international family. My grandparents lived\
  \ in Long Island, NY but their house could have basically been in Bavaria the moment\
  \ you opened the front door. My Oma came to New York after World War II, when she\
  \ met my Opa, a first generation German-American. \n\nTheir son and my Uncle moved\
  \ to Munich where he raised a family. My cousins would come to the United States\
  \ every summer. I was so excited to have them stay with us and share their delicious\
  \ gummi bears, chocolates, and stories of growing up in Europe. On the other side\
  \ of my family, my Aunt Kathy lives on a farm in County Clare, Ireland. Whenever\
  \ she would visit us I would feel the warmness of the Irish people in her embellished\
  \ Irish accent (she was born in Florida) and humor.\n\nEvery month, we would visit\
  \ my grandparents in Long Island. The highlight of the trip was going over the Verrazano\
  \ bridge and driving on the Belt Parkway. Looking out my window and seeing the Manhattan\
  \ skyline I would feel a sense of awe. Driving through Brooklyn and Queens was magical\
  \ to me. The people, the basketball courts, the diversity. I knew I had to be there.\
  \ I knew there was more to life than suburban New Jersey. \n\nI love to travel.\
  \ I love the freedom. I love to see new places. When you travel you can never intimately\
  \ know a place but you can get clues. I search for the clues. I find the people\
  \ that help me get the best clues. I do not always succeed and sometimes I end up\
  \ with a dead end or fall back on a Lonely Planet tip. But I keep trying to understand\
  \ where I am and who are the people who live there. \n\nFor the past twelve years,\
  \ I have worked as a community organizer in communities as different as rural Arkansas\
  \ and Harlem. One thing that is true in my work and I believe in travel is that\
  \ you need to enter the community. It is the people on the ground who have the stories\
  \ and the knowledge that inspire and help us better understand our world and our\
  \ destination. \n\nI think it is important for the world to hear more about the\
  \ stories of activists, freedom fighters, and those marginalized by society. Not\
  \ in a pandering or glorifying way but in an authentic way. In a way that is fair\
  \ to them and is honest. \n\nWe all have moments in travel and In life where we\
  \ take a chance and we pivot towards an uncertain direction. Looking at my backpack\
  \ and thinking about the thousands of miles ahead, I know I am right where I need\
  \ to be. \n\n\n*if interested I do have a travel website I am using for my current\
  \ trip: www.organizerxchange.com"
