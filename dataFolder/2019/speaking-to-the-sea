Text: "Walk through streets, it unveils the odds of society\nClimb mountains, it exhibits\
  \ the peaceful being in you\nObserve the waves of the ocean, it inspires to reach\
  \ the destination\n\n\nGokarna is a small town on the western coast of Karnataka,\
  \ India. It is absolutely authentic from any other place I had visited before. It\
  \ has temples, Tirtha , traditional sarees and also bikinis, beaches and beers on\
  \ the other hand.\nThe narrow, lengthy streets of Gokarna with colourful rangoli\
  \ before every home, chirping sounds of birds, cattle grazing plants in shade of\
  \ trees... everything welcomed me with a rhythm of love.\nAfter my darshan in the\
  \ temple, I started walking towards OM BEACH ( Beach which naturally is in a shape\
  \ of OM). With an hour of stride, I finally reached my destination.\nI rested myself\
  \ on the shore, where I could nowhere meet the waves of the sea. I then rummaged\
  \ my bag and clutched at my book to read. A couple that sat before me started muttering\
  \ each other not allowing me to concentrate on the book.\n\u201CBaby, We should\
  \ leave this place before the dusk. I have heard that there are no street lights\
  \ here. There is no battery in our torch to help us reach the temple side. So, let\u2019\
  s make this a remainder.\u201D I wondered. Even my stay is toward the temple side,\
  \ I thought.\nStaring at the waves, I spoke myself. \u2018Hello SEA\u2019\nThe sea\
  \ replied me with the sound of a wave\u2026\n\u2018AH! So you are answering me now!\u2019\
  \ I exclaimed\nAgain the same sound of a wave approached. \u2018The earth has music\
  \ for those who listen\u2019 I remembered some quote which I read somewhere.\n\u2018\
  Okay! So let us make a challenge. I am sitting here on your very own bank where\
  \ not a single drop of your water can come and touch me. If you have a courage of\
  \ touching me, I will stay for you until the Dark fills the sky\u2026 You ready?\u2019\
  \ I provoked with a smirk.\nThis time I had observed a big wave failing to meet\
  \ me by a distance. I laughed at its failure to reach me. But then I was diverted\
  \ to a beautiful girl with a blue bikini, fumbling a sea shell and running toward\
  \ the sea. She was voluptuous, with attractive eyes, curly burgundy hair and light\
  \ brown skin. She applied some sunscreen lotion to her curved body and crammed her\
  \ seashell with water. She held the shell on her head upside down when a thin water\
  \ streaks fell on her face and started to crawl all over her body. The streaks of\
  \ waterway continued its path touching her forehead, creeping to her lips and chest\
  \ and then to her navel motioning like a snake. All of a sudden there came a big\
  \ wave, bashing both of us to a distance!!! Gosh! I was wet in no time. My bag,\
  \ clothes and wallet all of a sudden swam in a wave! I looked at sea and can here\
  \ its satirical laugh at me. \u2018Never underestimate nature\u2019 I thought.\n\
  As per the challenge, I had been there for the whole day, till the darkness danced\
  \ with stars. I had experienced the best evening there watching the happiest faces\
  \ of kids while playing water games in the sea. I listened to few melodies sung\
  \ by an Italian. I also watched the way people spoke to Mother Moon with their YOGA\
  \ asanas. Despite losing the challenge I made to sea, I felt I was succeeded in\
  \ grabbing some memories."
