Text: "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the connection between me and Rajasthan but there\
  \ is something which allures me to the core, maybe the culture, sweetness in the\
  \ language, colors in their traditional clothes or it\u2019s just my roots which\
  \ pulls me to Rajasthan whenever I think about vacation!!\P I am going to give you\
  \ a glimpse of JODHPUR: THE BLUE CITY. Air had some mystical power or it\u2019s\
  \ just my Rajasthan love (or maybe because of less pollution) which made me happy\
  \ instantly as I landed my feet in Jodhpur after an overnight journey via bus. If\
  \ you are a traveler or new to the city just like me then the best way to stray\
  \ around the city is via ola auto or cab as the local auto drivers charges triple\
  \ (trust me!)\PMy first destination was Mehrangarh Fort, which stands high on the\
  \ hill above the city. I will suggest you to get an auto instead of cab so that\
  \ you intake the beauty of Jodhpur and some fresh Rajasthan air. The entry fee For\
  \ Indians is Rupees 150. Inside the fort, you will find restaurants too like The\
  \ Palki caf\xE9. The gates are too big as well as the modern day locks are shame\
  \ in front of the giant locks which we will later see in the museum. City looks\
  \ like a Blue Carpet from the top of Mehrangarh Fort. The antiques which you will\
  \ come across are of varied shapes and sizes of palanquins (palki in Hindi), hookahs,\
  \ swords, watches, locks, knives, cannonballs etc. Apart from museum, the Fort uncovers\
  \ palaces depicting Marwar ruler's splendid past.Inside Mehrangarh Fort, you will\
  \ come across Sheesh Mahal (palace of mirrors), Phool Mahal (palace of flowers)\
  \ where dancers used to perform for kings and Moti Mahal (pearl palace) which has\
  \ five balconies for five queens of the king. As the ladies of the royal family\
  \ were not allowed to attend the court proceedings, balconies were a way they could\
  \ at least hear them. There is a Lord Krishna Temple inside the fort and Chamunda\
  \ Devi temple far across from the fort.When you come outside of the fort there is\
  \ a way down to the famous Clock tower (Ghantaghar) which is famous for its local\
  \ market. Dont forget to click some pictures.To quench your thirst, you will find\
  \ Mishrilal Hotel just near the clocktower, which allows you to sit inside only\
  \ if you order Lassi. If you just want to eat Mirchi vada you will have to stand\
  \ outside (I know it is weird).\PI went to Food Adda fine dining restaurant in Ratanda\
  \ for dinner where I found world map on the wall, travelers will understand what\
  \ feeling it gives when you look at it.Next morning started with a fresh cup of\
  \ tea. All set to hit the town again.I went to Umaid Bhawan Palace, also known as\
  \ Taj Mahal of Marwar, named after the owner Maharaja Umaid Singh, 37th Rathore\
  \ ruler of Marwar.It\u2019s divided into three parts. The first part being the museum\
  \ is open for visitors where you will see pictures of royal family, their triumphs,\
  \ various shapes and sizes of clocks, cutlery, crockery, paintings etc.It\u2019\
  s divided into three parts. The first part being the museum is open for visitors\
  \ where you will see pictures of royal family, their triumphs, various shapes and\
  \ sizes of cutlery, crockery, paintings etc.The second part is run by Taj Hotel\
  \ group is also known as Taj Umaid Bhawan Palace which has a separate entrance.The\
  \ last is the residence of the royal family run by Maharaja Gaj Singh. This palace\
  \ is entirely made of sandstone and pink marble. There is a vintage car gallery\
  \ showcasing Rolls Royce, Mercedes, Cadillac etc.\PThe garden has a refreshment\
  \ caf\xE9 serving cold drinks and ice-creams.\PThe view from the parking is breathtaking\
  \ as you will see the entire city and the airport base too. The bungalows nearby\
  \ are also externally built of pink stone and have prices above hundred million,\
  \ owned by the king of Jodhpur.\PIn the end of this amazing trip, I ate dal bati\
  \ at Bhavani Dal Bati centre near sardarpura bus stand. They serve ghee separately\
  \ and charge extra if you want to sit in the A.C room. The scrumptious dal bati\
  \ makes you sloshed instantly and you will need time to gather yourself up.I wanted\
  \ to eat the regional dish \"ker sangri sabji\" and visit \"Toorji\u2019s Step Well\"\
  \ shown in many of the Bollywood movies.\PLaters, baby\u2026"
