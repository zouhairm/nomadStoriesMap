Text: "Another bead of sweat drips onto the pavement as I hastily cross one of Tokyo\u2019\
  s intricate intersections. The Dug cafe and bar sign is easy to miss in the sea\
  \ of neon signs that keep Shinjuku glowing ethereally in the evenings. I miss it\
  \ several times, each time the weight of the bag on my shoulder gets just a little\
  \ heavier.  Now my hand is on the handle but I struggle to go in. No one is around\
  \ to see me wrestling with my anxiety that this new experience brings. Courage triumphs\
  \ cowardice and I push forward. \n \nThe sounds of Grover Washington's saxophone\
  \ lead me down an old wooden staircase decorated with peeling jazz gig flyers. The\
  \ smell of whisky and wood immediately relaxes me and I look around the dimly lit\
  \ space. The patrons of this Shinjuku jazz kissaten consist solely of elderly Japanese\
  \ men at least three times my age. I ruminate over which Hibiki would be best to\
  \ mark this occasion and I order it neat. \n \nI pick a dark corner and nurse my\
  \ drink as I take in my surroundings. I observe suited up salarymen order from their\
  \ own personal bottles kept at the bar and everyone seems to know the owner by name.\
  \ While he does not smile when our eyes meet, I do not feel unwelcome. Familiarity\
  \ and acceptance in a jazz joint like this has to be earned and I respect that.\
  \ They are letting me in on their shared secret, a peek into a time when jazz was\
  \ a way of life; Tokyo in the 1960s.\n \nI take in the beautiful photographs of\
  \ Jazz musicians I struggle to recognise. I come to the conclusion they were taken\
  \ by the owner of the bar. Gradually, I start seeing less of the bar and more of\
  \ a lived-in museum, full of authentically aged jazz paraphernalia kept in pristine\
  \ condition.\n  \nRaised in a city of constant change and cut throat competition,\
  \ the past, barely half a century for a country as young as mine is still almost\
  \ impossible to remember. The closest would be to recall a staged imitation, an\
  \ intentionally \u2018old school\u2019 cafe replicating the design aesthetics of\
  \ one that existed before. Things are not allowed to age naturally where every inch\
  \ of the island needs to make the most economically advantageous use of the space.\
  \ Not even graves are spared in this wake. Everything exists in a permanent state\
  \ of transition, constantly being revamped so you learn not to get attached to places.\
  \ \n\nThese jazz cafes are gracefully going vintage, along with their patrons, but\
  \ the lack of young blood is unsettling. At the back of my mind, I know these establishments\
  \ will not survive the test of time. Their persistence to do things the old way\
  \ is admirable but naive. Naive to think another generation would feel the same\
  \ way. A wave of profound sadness hits me even when I have been programmed to welcome\
  \ change with open arms. It cannot be explained rationally but people have an emotional\
  \ attachment to places like this. I want so badly to preserve this place, this moment\
  \ but I\u2019ve learnt only too well that you can\u2019t force these things. Not\
  \ even institutions as established as the jazz kissaten are free from the hands\
  \ of change. Coltrane\u2019s \u2018Acknowledgement\u2019 has never sounded better\
  \ on the superior quality stereo equipment at this Japanese Jazz Joint and I leave\
  \ Dug, with a timely reminder to cherish my time in Japan."
