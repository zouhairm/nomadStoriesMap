Text: "Man does not live for himself but the society to which he belongs. We must\
  \ realize our responsibility outside the sphere of our own lives, think of others\
  \ and fulfil our duty to serve social needs.\nAs my plane soared over the Bay of\
  \ Bengal I looked down and realized that the \u2018sea is motion incarnate\u2019\
  , once it casts its spell it holds one in its net forever. Little did I know that\
  \ this \u2018adventurous\u2019 trip to Kolkata would change my life forever and\
  \ I would become a writer at a tender age of 14.\nWay back in 2014 when it was Diwali,\
  \ the festival of lights, we decided to visit our relatives in Kolkata. I had never\
  \ met my cousins before but their thought had been quietly stirring in my imagination\
  \ since I was a kid. I was delighted to learn that I had so many types of cousins,\
  \ and I could choose a \u2018favourite uncle\u2019. I was eager to share the resemblance\
  \ I had with my cousins and the endless combinations of genes and had prepared an\
  \ itinerary to explore the alluring city of Kolkata, also known as the city of joy,\
  \ a city to be felt, loved and smelled, as much as it is to be seen. \nOn reaching\
  \ Kolkata, I was overwhelmed to see the English Imperial Culture and the conventional\
  \ Bengali lifestyle, interspersed with beauty, diversity and all the elements of\
  \ a modern metropolis.\nThere were delights and surprises at every part of the journey.\
  \ From the whistling of trains at the Howrah Station to the burbling of water in\
  \ the Hoogly River, from the architectural magnificence to the scrumptious food,\
  \ I was left awestruck at the pulchritudinous nature of Kolkata. \nLittle did we\
  \ know that our next location would have a great impact on my life and would change\
  \ my life forever and I would go on a hunt for who I\u2019ve not yet become. The\
  \ \u2018Missionaries of Charity\u2019- home for the destitute, run by Saint Teresa\u2019\
  s Sisters of Charity- is a religious congregation established by Mother Teresa where\
  \ services are offered to the poorest of the poor regardless of their religion or\
  \ status. For a young teenager who had his own dreams, this was a world far beyond\
  \ imagination. \nAs I entered the confines of this \u2018home\u2019, I was awestruck\
  \ by the beauty of the garden on one side but aghast to see the graveyard on the\
  \ other. I learnt that as they passed on, their last rites were performed in this\
  \ same home where they lived as a family. Did life and death go hand in hand? I\
  \ experienced a totally different world. Men and women, some sick, some disabled,\
  \ helpless, convalescent and aged but with a deep sense of hope to be thought of,\
  \ loved and accepted. From that day I learnt the true definition of family. \nDiwali\
  \ stands for the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil, if only I could\
  \ illuminate their lives and make them feel loved. With my experience here the inclination\
  \ towards social service had begun.   In the process I experienced a close affinity\
  \ with a \u2018society\u2019 I had never ever seen but only heard of. With an unusual\
  \ spark in their eyes, they looked up to us as \u2018angels\u2019. \nAs I left the\
  \ premises, I had undergone a complete metamorphosis from a happy go lucky teenager\
  \ to a mature responsible person. (I had become a \u2018man\u2019, who had understood\
  \ the reality of life). \nPut it on the list of things that are impossible: no gadgets,\
  \ no internet, no social media, no video games, no fancy restaurants, no luxurious\
  \ homes and no designer clothes. The new friends that I made lived in their own\
  \ world, happy oblivious of the materialism.\n\nThe bells were tolling, the voices\
  \ were echoing, the wind was blowing and the leaves were rustling as I headed back\
  \ to my house.\n I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have\
  \ ended up where I intended to be.\n\n\u201CThe woods are lovely, dark and deep,\n\
  But I have promises to keep, \nAnd miles to go before I sleep \nAnd miles to go\
  \ before I sleep.\u201D"
