Text: "A LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN.... \n  Sounds scary right? What to expect?  Is it\
  \ going to be good? Bad? Wow! The sheer thought of what you'd find waiting for you\
  \ can make you so uneasy. That's how I felt the day I left home for the first time\
  \ in my life to another country. And that country is Ghana and I'm Nigerian by the\
  \ way. I was just 17years of age with no travel experience except in my dad's car\
  \ on our way to church, school and back home I enjoyed the rides so much I didn't\
  \ want it to end each time. I have always been a curious kid asking questions and\
  \ looking out the car window as we zoomed past the never ending roads, I admired\
  \ the shops I saw and what they sold I looked with pity at the street hawkers trying\
  \ to make ends meet,  at the traffic wardens trying to control the flow of traffic\
  \ and the blaring sun. I looked at the trees the birds in the sky everything amused\
  \ me I was always looking forward to another outing. A girl could only dream then,\
  \ my mom provided me with an Atlas which helped my curious mind I explored the pages\
  \ looking at the rivers, oceans, mountains to the countries written in the atlas\
  \ the whole knowledge I wanted in my head. This made Geography my favorite subject\
  \ and believe me I made wonderful grades in it and I can also boast that my drawing\
  \ skills are good. \n   My leap into the unknown started on cool day in the month\
  \ of December 2015. Got a call from big sister that she wanted me to come spend\
  \ the Christmas and new year with them in Ghana and she added I was going to come\
  \ by air so I should get prepared...What! Air!? I have never flown in an airplane\
  \ before! Mixed feelings I was happy and scared at the same time. I had questions\
  \ but no answers I was told I would have to experience it firsthand. And I agreed\
  \ I proceeded to get my passport from the immigration office in my locality I was\
  \ underaged and travelling unassisted and had to go through series of questioning\
  \ with my parents to be sure I wasn't been trafficked and I finally got my passport\
  \ after about a week of stress. \n My Flight ticket was bought online which I printed\
  \ out at a cyber cafe but there was a problem the nearest international airport\
  \ was far away from me so I had to leave home a day before departure  with my mom\
  \ as my guide she was scared for me she has flown so many times in the past but\
  \ developed a phobia for planes that didn't stop me I was energetic. We lodged in\
  \ an aunts place there we made arrangements for a taxi to take us to the airport.\
  \ I barely had any sleep was super charged. We arrived the airport 2hrs before departure\
  \ which was scheduled at 7:30am. I had my baggage checked in and searched, I proceeded\
  \ to the flight stand to get my boarding pass.The next part was customs there I\
  \ said goodbye to my mom and proceeded to pass the security check, stamp my passport\
  \ out of Nigeria. Found the boarding gate, one final check and I was shown into\
  \ the Aircraft I smartly found my seat (aisle). Take off was smooth but I thought\
  \ I was going to scream out when the plane lifted into the sky. I smiled and looked\
  \ around the aircraft everyone was calm and composed just hoped no one noticed I\
  \ was young and a first time flier. I was served snacks and tea, shortly after the\
  \ pilot announced that we would soon land at the Kotoka International Airport Accra\
  \ Ghana. I had to brace for the impact of touch down it was smooth and the whole\
  \ clearance started and ended smoothly. I got my luggage and headed out the exist\
  \ ( I watched and followed the steps of other people). At the exit there were tons\
  \ of people waiting for loved ones and taxi drivers shouting welcome in twi which\
  \ translates to 'Akwaaba' they asking if I needed a ride but my brother in-law was\
  \ already waiting for me he gave me the high five for my bravery. I was so Happy\
  \ and proud of myself I did it!! On the way to the house I passed the Flag staff\
  \ house and there my photography and videography started I didn't want to miss a\
  \ thing because I had a story and experience to share! \"The Unknown became the\
  \ known\""
