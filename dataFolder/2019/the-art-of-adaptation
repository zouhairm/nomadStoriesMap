Text: "When I think of my first night in Florida, I remember the heat. \n\nA failed\
  \ Visa renewal had taken me from my life and work in Prague and my finances required\
  \ joining my mother in Florida instead of our hometown of Rockville, Maryland. \n\
  Wearing a peacoat and winter wear, I left the AC chill of Orlando International\
  \ and stepped into the wet-blanket humidity of a tropical winter. I had gone from\
  \ the crisp air of a city filled with art, culture, and excitement, as well as the\
  \ stability of a job and friends, to an overheated peninsula I associated solely\
  \ with Disney, alligators, geriatrics, and bizarre news reports.  \n\nAfter wallowing\
  \ at home job-hunting, messaging overseas, and reacquainting myself with American\
  \ TV, I began to explore my new city and, find solace and connection in one thing\
  \ that had always brought me joy, Art. \n\nCentral Florida not only possed a small\
  \ but strong local art scene but, served as a place of inspiration for artists all\
  \ around the world. Talking long walks through my new neighbourhood, I could see\
  \ how the rich year-round greens, bright flowers, technicolor sunsets, wildlife,\
  \ and almost endless lakes could inspire the delicate watercolours and oil paintings\
  \ in local galleries and museums. \n\nYes, I missed the miles of museums in DC and\
  \ the artistic powerhouse of Central Europe but, the airy and well-curated Orlando\
  \ Museum of Art soon became a local favourite and I visit on a regular basis. I\
  \ had worried about feeling isolated from a more vibrant and fast moving world but,\
  \ here I was walking among art brought from Central America, Africa, Asia, Europe,\
  \ India, the Middle East.  Standing in a room filled with living artists I may never\
  \ meet, I began to feel less alone. In The Charles Hosmer Morse Museum, a place\
  \ I loved both for its illuminated stained glass and shadowy Tiffany Chapel, the\
  \ Old World I missed so much was brought back with pottery, furniture, glassworks,\
  \ and paintings inspired by the Art Deco and Art Nouveau Movement and  Alfons Mucha.\
  \ There was the glorious feeling of seeing 'a bit of hold home' as well as a growing\
  \ sense of local pride that this collection was here in perpetuity, providing a\
  \ sense of history as well as beauty, bygone splendour and grace. The Cornell Museum\
  \ at Rollins College, hosting everything from Renaissance masters to trailblazing\
  \ contemporary artists to its gifted faculty and students, has become the equivalent\
  \ of a creative battery, recharging me when I have writers' block or am neck-deep\
  \ in a creative slump. \n\nLocal artists, those showing at cafes and showing at\
  \ lesser-known spaces, thrived and supported each other in a way that I had not\
  \ seen living in the cities that I had. As I got to know them, I got to know the\
  \ wonderful spaces of my city, the places outside the tourist track that reminded\
  \ me of past travels, places where I could imagine myself happy and productive.\
  \ Throwing myself into writing, I began to draw on my surroundings, even viewing\
  \ places I had lived before in a new and richer light. New friendships within the\
  \ creative community, also well-travelled and diverse, began to ease the displacement\
  \ I had felt for months and months. When gallery-hopping with friends, art became\
  \ yet another way to connect, to share the experiences of our own particular skin.\
  \ \n\nI knew that if I was going to live here for at least the next few years that\
  \ I would need to find beauty in my surroundings. It had been easy before, effortless\
  \ when every street could leave you in a state of wonder but here, I needed to look\
  \ closer. Orlando required me to be active and not passive in my existence there.\
  \ Its history also lay in its art and the creative forces it cultivated. By learning\
  \ the history of this city, its dark chapters, points of pride, and continuous evolution,\
  \ could I truly understand what it was to live here and be more than someone looking\
  \ at everything from the outside. \n\nI may not be here all my life but, I do love\
  \ the view."
