Text: "Four circles rested in each corner, while red paths headed home.  I was staring\
  \ into a pale, blue diamond formed by the colorful curves of its circle and heard:\
  \ \u201CTe toca\u2026te toooooca\u2026Lia\u201D!!!  She was right.  It was my turn.\
  \  I rolled the dice, a five and a two, and moved one piece from its circle on the\
  \ Parcheesi board and another piece two spaces toward home.\n\nIt happened often\
  \ that year that I would wonder where I was and how I got there, and it would take\
  \ a few minutes for it to all flood back.  That day, sitting on a terrace outside\
  \ one of my student\u2019s great grandmother\u2019s homes in Villamart\xEDn, I was\
  \ thinking about how I ended up there\u2026\n\n\u2026the matte stainless-steel seat\
  \ back of the counter-height stools matched the framed art over the kitchen sink.\
  \  I looked up at it as I rinsed fresh fruit from the Ninja blender cup.  My husband\
  \ came up behind me and pulled me into his arms; he and I fit together so nicely.\
  \  After graduating from college in Rhode Island, we moved to Washington, D.C.;\
  \ found government contracting jobs; bought our first home; got engaged; and got\
  \ married all within five years.  One Saturday after we had been married two years,\
  \ we were driving to Centreville, MD to celebrate our anniversary.  The drive usually\
  \ took us about two hours but felt like twenty minutes.  When I was with him, that\
  \ was always the case; time raced.  We missed our exit because we were enjoying\
  \ the conversation so much, laughing until our stomachs hurt.  Our life together\
  \ was filled with love and lots of laughter, until it wasn\u2019t.\n\nFive years\
  \ into our marriage, I learned that my husband had been sleeping with women during\
  \ his business trips.  When I found out, I threw up every day for a week; it broke\
  \ me.  \n\n\u2026so, I moved to Villamart\xEDn, a rural town (pueblo blanco) in\
  \ the south of Spain.  One morning I walked up a narrow stairway to the rooftop\
  \ where I hung my laundry out to dry.  The buildings were white, and the sun warmed\
  \ my face as I looked down at the town below.  Where the houses stopped, all I could\
  \ see were hills covered with olive trees.  Scattered throughout the town and its\
  \ perimeter were chumberas, or cactus plants, plagued by the cochineal insect that\
  \ was sucking life from them, leaving them withered, cracking, crusty, and white.\
  \  \n\nVillamart\xEDn gave me life.  One day, a student of mine invited me to her\
  \ great grandmother\u2019s home for lunch.  It was the first time I\u2019d tried\
  \ boquerones, and I had to ask if I was supposed to eat the thin fish, spine and\
  \ all, or if I should spit out the fine bones.  They laughed and showed me how to\
  \ eat the fried anchovies correctly and put more Spanish tortilla on my plate. \
  \ They brought me fresh melon and flan, and when I couldn\u2019t eat a bite more,\
  \ we went outside to play Parcheesi until the sun set.\n\nNone of this was part\
  \ of my plan but living and teaching in Spain is my life now, and I have left the\
  \ withered version of it all behind me.  I\u2019m not sure onto which path I\u2019\
  ve fallen, but it has led me here."
