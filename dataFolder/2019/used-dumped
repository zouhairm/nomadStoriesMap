Text: "Gosh! No, not again.\n\nMy eyes brightens to the shaky effect of the driver\u2019\
  s struggle with the potholes. It jolts me awake, off my just-starting dream. We\u2019\
  ve just traveled three hours.\n\n\u201CBaba driver,\u201D someone says, \u201Ctake\
  \ it easy nah.\u201D\n\nThe shaggy man by my right shakes his head. His ill-creased\
  \ Ankara shirt seems to disagree too. A growing frustration lies in his eyes. Yet\
  \ I can't make out what he reacts to in particular\u2014the road or the bus falling\
  \ apart, the driver or other passengers, the journey itself or everything.\n\nNature\u2019\
  s greens wave by in living echoes of the unrelenting sun. My wide-awake hungry eyes\
  \ wander, catching a glimpse of the fleeting scenes beyond the window.\n\nMy eyes\
  \ desire to be shut, but being cramped in on both sides\u2014as one of the five\
  \ on a seat for a maximum of four, and over a ragged road\u2014I\u2019m not afforded\
  \ the relish.\n\nEntering Kabba, we run into a mini pool by the untarred edge of\
  \ the road, leaving a part of the window patterned in splashes of brown.\nThe shaggy\
  \ man can\u2019t pocket his displeasure any longer. As though the dirt stains his\
  \ shirt, he says, \u201CDriver, what\u2019s all this?\u201D The cast of his bushy\
  \ beard intensifies the squeeze on his face. \u201CYou\u2019ve been speeding and\
  \ speeding. Is your wife in the labor room?\u201D\n\nAn energetic voice breaks through\
  \ immediately. \u201CRide on, Driver. You can do better, yeah.\u201D The voice earns\
  \ a cheap hatred on the spot. It is the bespectacled guy at the back.\n\nThe man\
  \ in suit, by the edge of my seat, against the door, shares the uneasiness of the\
  \ shaggy man. His reflex gauge\u2014being filled gradually\u2014is not yet full,\
  \ and he forces himself to play the let-me-yet-reserve-my-comment role. Perhaps\
  \ he wishes he could tear his suit apart, fly from the door to the bespectacled\
  \ guy, shower some cheek-piercing slap or something far better on him, and give\
  \ the driver his share of the hot cake too. He shakes his head instead, and hisses\
  \ in resentment.\n\nAfter a long silence, the driver talks. \u201CYou all say I\
  \ run, huh? Shey it\u2019s my fault? This\u2019s normal speed. You suppose blame\
  \ your yeye governors who can\u2019t repair road before the rains.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Oga,\u201D the shaggy man says, \u201Cjust face your driving. For people like you,\
  \ Nigerian roads are better left this way. Even if it were good, I\u2019m sure you\u2019\
  d overdo the speeding.\u201D\n\n\u201CExactly,\u201D the fleshy woman in the front\
  \ seat shoots. \u201CIt\u2019s a blessing in disguise for us.\u201D\n\nThe man in\
  \ suit shouts. \u201CBlessing ke? It\u2019s the worst, worst thing ever. Don\u2019\
  t just let\u2019s talk about it.\u201D\n\nIn seconds, the back-and-forth turns political.\
  \ And phew, advanced corruption becomes the key phrase. Faces get lit, crisp. Firestorms\
  \ and disagreements ensue. Ignorance, arrogance, indignation, eloquence, truth,\
  \ reality, lies, pessimism, discrimination all mix so badly. We head for a big-time\
  \ snow-in-the-hearth mishmash. \n\nSurprising enough, the lady in yellow, by the\
  \ edge of the second seat, keeps doing her thing amid it all. From time to time,\
  \ her head shakes to the invisible rhythm of her plugged headset. She doesn\u2019\
  t care\u2014and I envy her indifference.\n\n\u201CSeriously,\u201D the bespectacled\
  \ guy airs, \u201Cwe\u2019re crazy in this country. Really crazy.\u201D\n\nReactions\
  \ arise in a bang. How can he say that? The rough chats blossom. I wonder why everyone\
  \ appears to have a point to prove\u2014even myself.\n\nSeconds roll off in thousands,\
  \ our tire keeps ironing the black tar. The palaver eases. Our noses know the choking\
  \ smell from the exhaust. It assuages for some time, just to stream in at subsequent\
  \ times. \nSomeone exasperated bitches from the backseats. The driver says nothing\
  \ till it fades away.\n\nAt Kabba checkpoint, we pass through, unchecked. The driver\
  \ gives a triumphant laugh. \u201CSee those yeye officers? Them no get my time today,\
  \ \u2018cause them play with some fine girls over there.\u201D\n\nAs more hours\
  \ and moments creep in, the sun 'chameleons' with it. At a time, it rested on the\
  \ window; now it peeks from behind, aging fast.\nEvening. The bus halts at Anyigba\
  \ garage. Each go their own way, used up, sorry for one another. \n\nI never expected\
  \ to find poor multifarious souls crazed by common plight."
