Text: "I turned thirty this year, so my best friend Sarah and I decided to celebrate\
  \ by planning a backpacking trip through Mexico - the land that had brought us together\
  \ and where we had lived 2 years prior. The night before our trip, whilst packing\
  \ my ratty little backpack, Sarah watched me in awe as I masterfully picked what\
  \ to bring and what to leave behind. I\u2019d think out loud saying things like\
  \ \u201Clet\u2019s be real, this is very cute and I look fabulous in it, but I won\u2019\
  t ever wear it because it is hot as hell in Quintana Roo right now, and\u2026comfort\
  \ comes first!\u201D Keeping in mind we would travel from town to town, in really-small-and-packed-with-people\
  \ vans, and what each stop would require, in my head I had four clear categories:\
  \ the most important one - shoes and clothes for dancing (you can be cute and functional\
  \ at the same time), something comfortable for our hike through the Sian Ka\u2019\
  an jungle, bikinis, and the bare hygiene and makeup essentials. I managed to fit\
  \ all of that and even a just-in-case cute dress and my kindle! I\u2019m that good.\
  \ Sarah also cracked up not only at how strategic I was being with what I was bringing\
  \ but also at the placement of each thing in my bag. Why would you put your bikini\
  \ and passport at the bottom if you knew it\u2019d be the first thing you\u2019\
  d use as soon as you landed? Duh. \n\nSomething I discovered during that trip, however,\
  \ is that I may have mastered the art of packing for these kind of multiple-adventure\
  \ trips in the literal sense, but I am still learning a lot about what I should\
  \ carry in my figurative backpack in this journey we call \u201Clife.\u201D As we\
  \ hopped from gorgeous place to gorgeous place -Isla Mujeres, Akumal, Bacalar, Sian\
  \ Ka\u2019an, Playa del Carmen, etc.,- unbeknownst to me at first, I couldn\u2019\
  t fully enjoy it or take it all in because I was carrying some unnecessary baggage\
  \ as well. It all hit me on the third day when both our figurative backpacks burst\
  \ open and we had a fight; I had certain expectations of how the trip was supposed\
  \ to go and, since it wasn\u2019t going how I wanted it to, I was becoming resentful,\
  \ and even though I thought I was hiding it well, my friend was definitely noticing\
  \ it, and that made her resentful as well. Resentment is heavy and ugly, and I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find such personal ugliness during this trip, but I am thankful I was\
  \ forced to face it. This \u201Cfight\u201D turned into an honest and raw conversation\
  \ that led us both to drop our resentment as well as our unspoken and unrealistic\
  \ expectations, to be kind and patient with one another, and to fully embrace the\
  \ beauty we both had the privilege to enjoy together. \n\nThat moment therefore\
  \ seemed as good as any to reflect on my life so far -the kind of person I used\
  \ to be, the one I was now, and the one I wished to become. I reflected on the things\
  \ that used to weigh me down or even enslave me. The things I used to carry in my\
  \ figurative backpack that I have thankfully let go of, or at least continue to\
  \ work on letting go of. Things like fears, toxic relationships, and deep insecurities,\
  \ which used to control all my thoughts and how I viewed life. I have gladly left\
  \ behind all of these things in order to lessen my load and walk freely and lightly.\
  \ In turn, I also reflected on the things I have embraced and decided to carry with\
  \ me that have made my heart fuller and stronger, that have made my \u201Ctrip\u201D\
  , my life, richer and more enjoyable. Things like the love and wisdom of God and\
  \ of my family and friends, a deep gratitude for all the experiences lived and the\
  \ lessons learned along the way, and a developing appreciation for beauty found\
  \ in the ordinary and the mundane. However, I am still learning, I\u2019m still\
  \ choosing what to carry and which burdens to drop. Packing is an art, and I am\
  \ still refining it."
