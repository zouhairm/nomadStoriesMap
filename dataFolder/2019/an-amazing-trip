Text: "After 8 hours of journey, I reached at Stockholm from New Delhi on 30th August\
  \ 2017. From the airport, I took a local sim card and booked a Flygbussarna bus\
  \ to the hostel. As the hostel receptionist already left by the time I reached,\
  \ I had to wait around 30-40 min before being able to enter by the help of a hostel\
  \ mate. I was relieved that my bed and blankets were prepared along with my name\
  \ tag and soon, I fell asleep, as it was drizzling outside and I was a little bit\
  \ jet lagged.\nThe following day, I went to the common room in the hope of getting\
  \ some help and saw the guy who helped me in the previous night. I was asking him\
  \ for some suggestions regarding travelling in the city along with the best mode\
  \ of transportations. Meanwhile, a German guy who was cooking nearby overheard me\
  \ and came forward to help with an elaborate city map. He advised me to take a 3\
  \ day pass as it covers bus, metro and some boat transportations as well. Being\
  \ new, I agreed to him and asked whether I can travel with him. Then he introduced\
  \ me to two of his German friends, Christof and Thomas. After a brief talk and fresh\
  \ up, we set our journey to explore Stockholm.\nWe left Kungsholman via metro and\
  \ reached at Stadsholman in Gamlastan to see the Royal Palace (Kungliga Slottet).\
  \ The guard changing ceremony was going on when we reached there and it lasted for\
  \ about 40 minutes. Soon after that, we explored the palace and its history, and\
  \ after a bit of strolling around, we decided to go to the nearby church, Storkyrkan.\
  \ I was awestricken while exploring the marvellous beauty of the church.  What caught\
  \ my attention was the beautifully crafted wooden statue of St. George and the dragon.\
  \ After spending some time in the church, we were again on the cobblestone street\
  \ in the search of some delicious Swedish food and then we went to Ridderholman\
  \ to enjoy the majestic view of Stockholm. \nThe next day, we decided to go to Stora\
  \ Fjaderholmen island. It was an awesome 20-30 minute journey and far from the hustle\
  \ bustle of the city. We trekked for an hour exploring every bit of the small island\
  \ and finally sat down on the shore to enjoy the sunset. Upon returning, we went\
  \ to a live music bar in Gamlastan. After that, we went to a nearby coffee shop,\
  \ to have some hot cappuccino and enjoy the night view of the city. There, I saw,\
  \ two guys were holding hand and being cosy with each other with lots of love. Being\
  \ gay in India is something a taboo, where public display of affection is usually\
  \ looked down. At that moment, I wished, to have someone, just to hold hands and\
  \ to enjoy the cold breeze of the city with the warmth of coffee and love.\nIt was\
  \ the third day and Thomas decided to stroll around the city, exploring local food,\
  \ market and in the night going to some popular bars to enjoy our last day together\
  \ and I happily obliged. After wondering till 5 PM, I and Thomas went to Tivoli\
  \ Gronalund, while Magnus and Christof chose to explore the city more. After that,\
  \ we went to the bar and enjoyed our last beer together. While returning, I challenged\
  \ the Helldog\u2019s spicy hotdog challenge and with a great difficulty I managed\
  \ to succeed. But, the aftermath of the challenge was very bad, as I was continuously\
  \ vomiting and seriously unwell. Lesson learned. \nWhile waiting at Skavasta airport\
  \ for my flight to Warsaw later that night, I was thinking about this beautiful\
  \ Scandinavian capital. I loved how the walls of the underground metro were designed\
  \ with various colours, arts etc., how people were so respectful to each other,\
  \ positive view of towards LGBT, healthy lifestyle and very low population density.\
  \ I did not expect, my first international travel to be this amazing. I just took\
  \ a leap into the unknown, believing everything would be okay and I was astonished\
  \ at the end. Finally, I waived to Stockholm, with a heavy heart."
