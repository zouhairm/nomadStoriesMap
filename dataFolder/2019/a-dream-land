Text: "I could feel each goosebump form on my arm as I quickly rushed off the crowded\
  \ train cart. Girona was a lot dirtier than I expected, and there were barely any\
  \ people around; it almost reminded me of a ghost town but I wasn\u2019t about to\
  \ judge a book by its cover, not here not in Spain. Spain was the place where it\
  \ all began, where the legend, Salvador Dali was born and fell in love with art\
  \ so it was poetic for me to fall in love with art in the same magnificent place.\
  \ I had gone to Spain when I felt the most overwhelmed and overall disconnected\
  \ to the world around me. I  thought emerging myself in the beautiful Spanish culture\
  \ would wake me up from this coma I was stuck in, little did I know the artist most\
  \ known for his dream-like artwork would be the one to wake me up from my own dreamstate.\
  \  \n\nEver since we decided to go to Spain my best friend Kristal said she wanted\
  \ to see the Dali Museum, her exact words were, \u201CI don\u2019t care where we\
  \ go, as long as we see the Dali Museum I\u2019ll be happy and it\u2019ll all be\
  \ worth it,\u201D but as we got on the 2 hour train ride from Barcelona to Girona\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if this would really be worth it. The 60 euros\
  \ we used to get there was the most I spent on one thing the entire trip and I felt\
  \ a pang of regret. At that time I had no idea that this trip would not only be\
  \ worth it but, completely change my view of life forever. \n\nAs we got closer\
  \ to the museum I tried to mask my disappointment with excitement but it wasn\u2019\
  t working. The ten minute walk to the museum felt like an eternity and I could feel\
  \ myself getting crankier by the second. However, everything changed when I saw\
  \ the museum and I genuinely became excited. The museum was magical, from the inside\
  \ out the entire building was breathtaking. The building was a vibrant brick color\
  \ with these intricate gold studs covering each side. I was in awe and became hopeful\
  \ that the unique architecture would be a reflection of Dali\u2019s work and I allowed\
  \ myself to judge a book by its cover this time and became increasingly curious\
  \ to see Dali\u2019s art. \n\n\tAfter buying our tickets the curator explain to\
  \ us that this was the same building that featured Dali\u2019s first exhibition\
  \ at the age of 14 and was only a few blocks away from where he was born in Spain.\
  \ He and his wife opened the Dal\xED Theatre-Museum in 1974 and it was the largest\
  \ Surrealist structure in the world. As the lady continued talking something caught\
  \ my eye, these human like figures were all lined up on window sills outside. My\
  \ curiosity got the best of me and I walked deeper into the museum to get a closer\
  \ look. I was speechless, I remember thinking about my brother in that moment; growing\
  \ up he always told me if something\u2019s too good to be true it probably is however,\
  \ this wasn\u2019t the case with the Dali\u2019s art.\n \nEvery piece displayed\
  \ at the Dali Museum was breathtaking. His unique perspective invited people into\
  \ his dreamscapes through what Dali originated as \u201Cparanoiac-critical method.\u201D\
  \ Dali manifested characters and settings in subconscious realities inspired by\
  \ Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theories. He had a gift in decoding images from\
  \ his dreams and inserting them in places that could exist in the real world. His\
  \ paintings revealed illusions and hallucinations from the human mind, leaving viewers\
  \ confused and intrigued. \n\nMy trip to the Dali museum opened my eyes to different\
  \ types of art. The way Dali depicted his fears and his emotions into his paintings\
  \ in a dream like sense was magical. It opened my eyes and made me realize that\
  \ everyone has problems and fears and instead of shutting down I should flip them\
  \ to create something positive. Dali was known to blur the lines between illusion\
  \ and reality which made him an unforgettable figure of the modern art movement\
  \ and my favorite artist."
