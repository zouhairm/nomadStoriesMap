Text: "EXTREME. This word was just an adjective prior to my hiking experience \u201C\
  down under\u201D in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia. Having already\
  \ engaged in the typical tourist attractions of Sydney I wanted to connect with\
  \ the natural world that is found when you truly release your expectations and yield\
  \ to the unknown. \n\nThe local connection of my cousin\u2019s ex-pat friend led\
  \ me to meeting a Motley Crew of six extreme-experience seekers. The group was out\
  \ to hike the National Pass, a Grade 4 \u201CBushwalking experience recommended\u201D\
  \ trail for Frankie\u2019s birthday. I\u2019d learned that Frankie and his brother\
  \ were native Aussies, but what I didn\u2019t expect was to meet a girl from France,\
  \ a hardy Scottish lass, and Wales Dan as I called him. They were pumped. There\
  \ existed a split-second when I thought, I\u2019m trusting these people with my\
  \ life in a country where my cell phone is rendered useless (as this was prior to\
  \ our improved satellites), what if\u2014I didn\u2019t want to waste my time with\
  \ any paranoid hypotheticals, I wanted to feel fearless. \n\nIt took a two hour\
  \ train ride to unite with my new comrades only then to cram into the foot area\
  \ of an off-road SUV surrounded by backpacks, sleeping bags and other appropriate\
  \ wilderness gear that I was without. I sat curled up with my knees into my chest\
  \ and listened to the laughter that came cascading down on me in reassurance that\
  \ I was in good hands. This group was eager for a challenge, and I rose to it to\
  \ meet them.  \n\nWe were seeking Wentworth Falls for Frankie\u2019s alfresco birthday\
  \ lunch. Unbeknownst to me the hike would include an entire box of wine to be shared\
  \ (and finished) by all. Here I was fancying myself as being prepared by bringing\
  \ a Nalgene bottle filled with water, naturally the Aussie\u2019s showed me how\
  \ it\u2019s done down under. I had dressed in layers as instructed by my hiking\
  \ clan as the weather in the Blue Mountains can change quite quickly. Once on the\
  \ trail we encountered perilously-placed metal staircases and ladders covered with\
  \ cages to safely prevent us from flying off of the mountain\u2019s face and into\
  \ the gorge below. These were intimidating to say the least and as the weather fluctuated\
  \ between feeling like a warm 25 degrees C to what felt like a chilling 8, my hands\
  \ shivered and felt likely to freeze against the metal railings, feeling stiff and\
  \ hard after a descent. Outer layers on for warmth when it rained and outer layers\
  \ tied securely around my waist when I began to sweat. They weren\u2019t kidding\
  \ about this bipolar weather, would it make up its mind? Luckily, in addition to\
  \ the gorgeous blue hue provided by the eucalyptus in the mountains, I experienced\
  \ some entertainment from my companions. Each time the weather shifted and we had\
  \ change of attire, one of them would proclaim, \u201CExtreme!\u201D Before I knew\
  \ it, I too joined them in the proclamation of the word, it soon became our anthem.\
  \ \n\nFinally reaching our destination at the base of Wentworth Falls we stopped\
  \ to celebrate Frankie with an extreme lunch: a proper Fondue meal at the base of\
  \ the largest waterfall in the Blue Mountains of Australia. I stood in disbelief\
  \ as they assembled a Fondue pot complete with fire and divvied up the forks for\
  \ eating. True to form, just as the cheese was ready for our devouring it began\
  \ to rain. Here we were, at the base of a mammoth of a waterfall clinging to the\
  \ crag of the mountain with arms outstretched protecting a Fondue pot. To fellow\
  \ hikers we were quite the sight and sound, a chorus of dialects and inflections\
  \ cheering in our extreme Fondue accomplishment.\n\nLooking back on my Blue Mountains\u2019\
  \ trek it\u2019s fitting that it began with strangers and ended with friends. That\
  \ is the Australia that I came to love, a place where things are never as you expect\
  \ and connections are as diverse as the weather."
