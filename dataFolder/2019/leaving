Text: "She sits alone in the Burger King. She's waiting for something. The train.\
  \ She cradles her cup of coffee, looks into the deep brown-almost black, thinks,\
  \ there could be anything at the bottom \u2014 a bug, a soggy fry, one of those\
  \ fake plastic nails\u2014 and I would never know. \n\tShe lifts the cup to her\
  \ lips, the sleeves of her oversized jean jacket slouch, baring her wrists. Takes\
  \ a sip, burns her lips, frowns at the drink, lowering it back to the table. Her\
  \ hair, the same deep brown as her coffee, newly cut to shoulder length, falls into\
  \ her eyes. She lets it stay. \n\tSteam hovers over the cup, shimmering in the afternoon\
  \ sun. Her head hurts. Too much coffee or not enough? \n\tEveryone else sitting\
  \ in the BK is alone too. Maybe this is where people come to be alone \u2014when\
  \ they have no-one. \n\tThe man in the booth across from her eats sloppily. Bits\
  \ of lettuce hang out of the burger, ketchup and mayo slop out onto the tray. His\
  \ lips smack with each bite, tongue darting out to lick the grease from his lips.\n\
  \tShe doesn\u2019t watch him directly. She watches his shadow. The low afternoon\
  \ sun slides in through the window, casting the man\u2019s shadow perfectly on the\
  \ floor next to him. She watches him hunch his head down to meet the Burger in his\
  \ hands, take a big, sloppy, wet bite and pull back again. \n\tThe room is quiet.\
  \ A bit of jazz plays as background music, interrupted by the wet smack of the man\u2019\
  s lips.\n\tOut the window she sees the pedestrian traffic light. The orange hand\
  \ blinks, the numbers below counting down from 10. She watches them blink, thinks,\
  \ I could make it if I ran. Counts with it from 5 under her breath, 4, 3, 2, 1,\
  \ stop. \n\tThe man rises from his booth, gathers his trash and exits. \n\tA woman\
  \ across the room meets her eyes.\n\t\u201CDo you know what time it is?\u201D the\
  \ woman asks. \n\tShe pulls out her phone, it reads 4:41.\n\t\u201C4:45\u201D she\
  \ says. The woman nods and looks away, down, eyebrows pulled up together, takes\
  \ a sip of her drink. Maybe she's waiting for something too, she thinks, how nice\
  \ we all move through this world together."
