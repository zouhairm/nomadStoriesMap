Text: "I had a very normal and routinary life in Argentina, a nine years old relationship\
  \ with Mariano, a nice job and an apartment with him. I was happy with my fitness\
  \ trainer life and my friends in Argentina but i always had the feeling that i have\
  \ to explore the world. \nOne day, with Mariano we booked for the flight tickets\
  \ to go together to Thailand for one month. Our trip plan was to do some snorkelling\
  \ and diving, to travel around the north visiting temples, natural places and then\
  \ the most beautiful beaches on the south like Phi Phi Island. We spent a few nights\
  \ watching together on the TV differents inspiring videos about this marvelous place,\
  \ dreaming with our trip who was coming really soon. \nOne day, i woke up and i\
  \ felt something bad on my chest, i knew that something wrong was happening and\
  \ i realized that he stopped loving me. Is difficult to explain but he was acting\
  \ distant and cold with me, after so long time together the routine was on our couple.\n\
  \ We split in a very sad and dramatic separation after nine years together. I thought\
  \ that my life was ending but i took my bagpack and a lot of power from inside and\
  \ took the plane to Thailand with him. \nWith my heart broken, we flew together,\
  \ and we kiss very passionate on that plane. For one minute i thought that he wanted\
  \ to stay with me again but when we arrived Bangkok he said good bye to me and he\
  \ left me alone on that airport..\nI start traveling alone around Thailand, i start\
  \ meeting new people and discovering new places, i started to grew up and to felt\
  \ more adult. I started to live the life that always i wanted to live..\nThe day\
  \ to take the plane to came back to Argentina arrived and we met on Bangkok Airport,\
  \ we flew together to Istanbul because that place was the stop over between Thailand\
  \ and Buenos Aires and when we've been planing to do the international conexions\
  \ i had to tell him my secret plan: I AM NOT GOING WITH YOU TO ARGENTINA. \nWe started\
  \ to cry together very much and we said good bye..\nWhen i turn around in the MIGRATION\
  \ part i realize that i was alone in Istanbul, only with my backpack full of dreams\
  \ and my heart broken because of him..\nAfter that day i started to traveling around\
  \ the world alone, non stop. It has been two years now and i have 46 countries in\
  \ my list, thousand of experiences and stories. Hundred of volunteers and dozens\
  \ of new friends and family of all over the world. \nI am writing this from a coffee\
  \ shop in Edinburgh lay down with my heart french sister that i met in Cardiff doing\
  \ a volunteer last year and i can confirm and say that the life is something marvelous,\
  \ that the dreams are made off to make them true and that if we love to do something,\
  \ we have to do it. The time to live is now. \u2665\uFE0F\n i will be always gratefull\
  \ with Mariano, because i started my dreaming life after him and of course we keep\
  \ in touch now like family, not like a couple anymore. \nThe the love and confidence\
  \ still permanent between us. \u2665\uFE0F"
