Text: "The summer of 2018 was a whirlwind of emotions, expectations, realities and\
  \ tough breaks. Quite literally in some instances. I had decided to leave my job\
  \ as a Sous Chef at a great restaurant to go and travel to Peru. Not because I hated\
  \ my job but because I wanted to take a risk and maybe along the way discover more\
  \ about myself and my passion for food. My goal was to travel across Peru, staying\
  \ with locals and meeting other travelers along the way. But also to have to opportunity\
  \ to apprentice at one of the best restaurants in the world. That was my ultimate\
  \ goal, to push myself to adapt and learn. Not to mention gain some incredible work\
  \ experience. \n\nSince I am a spontaneous person this trip was put together with\
  \ only a couple months of planning. I had connected with a group I had previously\
  \ travelled to South America with before and everything was in full swing. After\
  \ a few days of hesitating I finally got up the nerve to give my notice. Instead\
  \ of being met with feelings of resentment I was met with appreciation and encouragement.\
  \ The staff threw me a going away party which was something I never would have wanted.\
  \ But I left feeling loved and that this was going to be one of the great experiences\
  \ of my life. \n\nLanding in Peru was surreal. It was my fourth time traveling to\
  \ South America but it's unlike anywhere I'd been so far. The food was incredible.\
  \ Walking around different markets and meeting vendors bon the street blew my mind.\
  \ Food wasn't the only thing on the itinerary though. Throughout the week the group\
  \ and I took Spanish classes, visited monuments, volunteered at a school. I honestly\
  \ could have stayed for a few more days in Cusco but the group had planned to leave\
  \ the city and head for a small community up in the highlands of Peru. This is where\
  \ everything changed. \n\nIt was a beautiful morning and we had set out to help\
  \ a local farmer with her quinoa crop. We helped her get her crop ready to sell\
  \ at the market. After that we went back to the homes we were staying at. Some of\
  \ the local kids were playing some soccer and asked us to join. I agreed. After\
  \ a few minutes the ball was kicked out of bounds and I ran to go get it. Then.\
  \ I slipped. My ankle slid right into a rock at the worst possible angle. My ankle\
  \ dislocated and in the process broke my leg. I looked down and my ankle was pointing\
  \ in a direction that it never should. I called out for my friends to help me. I\
  \ remained calm even though I'd never been in that much pain. There was one problem.\
  \ We were in the mountains. The only way to the hospital was by taxi. The only hospital\
  \ with the equipment that I would need was 3 hours away. It took an hour for the\
  \ cab to arrive. After the most agonizing 5 hours of my life I was finally being\
  \ prepped for surgery. Laying on the stretcher thinking about all my plans, goals,\
  \ or just normal life for the foreseeable future made me feel as helpless as I have\
  \ in my entire life. I was 10 days in. To a 41 day trip. I may have not learned\
  \ what I wanted to about myself but it was something I'll never forget."
