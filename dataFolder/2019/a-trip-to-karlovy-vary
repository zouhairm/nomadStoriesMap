Text: "Snow began to fall, obscuring the view out of the windows, as our little tour\
  \ bus wound its way up through the mountains on the outskirts of Prague. Not that\
  \ there had been much to see, anyway: you could only ooh and aah at so many miles\
  \ of bleakly beautiful countryside before you began to tire of horse paddocks and\
  \ rolling hills. Every so often, a crackle of feedback would echo throughout the\
  \ bus as the tour guide, an older woman named Clara, turned on her microphone to\
  \ share a few facts about the passing scenery. \u201CThis is the town of Bruvary,\u201D\
  \ she said in her heavy Czech accent as we trundled past a small, rundown village\
  \ whose few dwellings sported roofs of corrugated tin, walls of weathered brick,\
  \ and backyards populated by rusty tractor-trailers, \u201Ca major producer of beer.\u201D\
  \ We were bound for the medieval town of Karlovy Vary, best known today for its\
  \ abundance of hot springs, but first, it seemed, we had to get through the boonies.\n\
  \nI had booked my ticket to Karlovy Vary on a whim after seeing it mentioned briefly\
  \ in my \u201CLet\u2019s Go, Europe!\u201D travel guide. It\u2019s one of those\
  \ places that\u2019s famous but not famous, if you catch my drift: blockbuster movie\
  \ upon blockbuster movie, including Queen Latifah\u2019s \u201CLast Holiday\u201D\
  \ and Daniel Craig\u2019s \u201CCasino Royale,\u201D has been filmed there, and\
  \ wealthy French teenagers and twentysomethings flock there every summer to luxuriate\
  \ in its waters, but your average tourist will probably say something along the\
  \ lines of \u201CGesundheit!\u201D if you mention it to them. (I had more than one\
  \ friend confuse it with Karlovy Lazne, the largest nightclub in Central Europe\
  \ and Prague\u2019s partying claim to fame). Their cluelessness, however, becomes\
  \ understandable when you consider that Karlovy Vary is by no means easily accessible,\
  \ especially to students on a budget. Tucked away in rural west Bohemia, it\u2019\
  s a two-hour bus ride from Prague each way, and over roads that become precariously\
  \ narrow at times, no less. If you can stomach this comparatively grueling travel\
  \ time, though, you\u2019ll be able to take the edge off once you get there in style:\
  \ with a dip in the hot springs. \n\nOnce in Karlovy Vary, around an hour after\
  \ leaving Bruvary and its endless fields of hops, I was able to make their acquaintance\
  \ firsthand. Ringed by crowds of tourists, all snapping pictures as if their lives\
  \ depended on it, the springs took the form of above-ground brick wells from which\
  \ billowed, train-stack-esque, constant clouds of steam. Give me a towel and some\
  \ shower shoes and burn an incense stick or two, and I would\u2019ve found it nigh\
  \ well impossible to distinguish the place from a continental sauna---had it not\
  \ been for the sheer number of people downing the spring water itself. Local lore\
  \ holds that the springs have incredible healing properties, and it's a myth people\
  \ have bought into wholeheartedly. Perched on a bench besides one of the most famous\
  \ of the springs, V\u0159\xEDdlo, I met more of these devotees, some of whom had\
  \ flown in from all over the world just to dip their hands in or wash their faces\
  \ with its water, than I could have ever imagined existed. A young woman cast her\
  \ eyes up to the ceiling, as though experiencing communion with God, as she sipped\
  \ water from a china mug. A middle-aged woman bent down to the well, not without\
  \ some difficulty, and splashed some water onto her cheeks. An older man, his eyes\
  \ staring off in two different directions, shuffled up to me and thrust his wrist\
  \ in my face. \u201CLook at my hands!\u201D he enthused. \u201CThey were all--\u201D\
  \ he made a gesture that seemed to indicate wrinkling--- \u201Cand now they\u2019\
  re smooth! Healed!\u201D \n\nHe shook them at me again with the zeal of an ardent\
  \ believer. They still looked pretty wrinkly to me, but who was I to burst his bubble?\
  \ I felt compassion mixed with a surreal sense that I'd gone undercover among cult\
  \ members. \n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"they are.\""
