Text: "I\u2019ll admit that I was apprehensive before my first visit to Naples about\
  \ 17 years ago. The streets looked dirty with piles of trash crowding the Vesuvian\
  \ city, colourful people screaming and yelling from every corner and stray dogs\
  \ running around what seemed to be a God-forsaken \u2018sin city\u2019. \nLittle\
  \ did I know that there, in that very filthy yet fascinating place, I\u2019d find\
  \ love and my true self. \nWhen my boss told me I had to take a course in Naples,\
  \ I was immediately taken aback. Being tired, underpaid and simply sick and tired\
  \ of having to leave Rome, a city I had learned to love over the years, despite\
  \ its loud citizens and maddening traffic. Naples, on the other hand, was a completely\
  \ different story. Going to Naples meant having to wake up before dawn, taking a\
  \ potentially dirty train and spending my whole day listening to the same old story.\
  \ But there was another, deeply rooted fear which gave me reason enough to resist\
  \ going to Naples. I had been dreading that day since the last time I had been there.\
  \ A time when I used to be carefree and in love with a certain Andrea\u2026 The\
  \ sole idea of seeing him again made me giddy with both fear and anticipation. Although\
  \ I felt vulnerable and paralyzed, deep down inside I knew I had to go: this would\
  \ be a hugely exciting experience, as it would serve as a final goodbye before we\
  \ parted ways forever.\nI arrived sleepy-eyed and bed-headed after intermittent\
  \ dozing on the train. I then grabbed my brief-case and ventured out into the scorching\
  \ sunshine to find a taxi. I gave the driver the address and off we went. The first\
  \ encounter with Neapolitan driving quite took my breath away. It became apparent\
  \ rather quickly that on Italian roads it is every driver for themselves. Horns\
  \ are constantly beeping, and cars are always squeezing between other cars. As I\
  \ approached the British Council\u2019s office, which had the most amazing views\
  \ of the city and Mount Vesuvius, I could not help but reminisce about the one that\
  \ got away.\nI remember the day I met him clearly: I was a student, he was a waiter\
  \ at the local pizzeria. We were suddenly smitten. He asked me on a date. He then\
  \ suggested we go for a walk. What followed were the happiest days of my life: we\
  \ pondered the souvenir shops and quickly dashed to the beach. swimming in the sea,\
  \ sunbathing, having gelato and a milkshake, watching street performers, and simply\
  \ having the most perfect time. It was then that I realised it would be inevitable\
  \ to fall for him. In the evening, after 4 hours of aimlessly wandering, we went\
  \ back to his place and passion ensued\u2026 upon waking up, we decided to yet again\
  \ hit the streets of what had initially felt like an unknown city, by now part of\
  \ us.\nAfter a surprisingly light meal of fried delicacies, we hit the streets again,\
  \ stopping for one-euro tiny cups of coffee and two scoops of the most heavenly\
  \ ice-cream I had ever tasted. Our next day was again filled with aimless wandering.\
  \ We discovered a small pastry shop which did three bab\xE0 treats for one euro,\
  \ so naturally we took advantage of this deal each day following.\nWe finally discovered\
  \ the metro \u201CToledo\u201D and made our way to the city center, getting lost\
  \ now our second nature, we embraced our newly acquired fate of wanderers. It was\
  \ then that I had the best ice cream of my life: getting stranded was now far more\
  \ pleasant. Back to Andrea\u2019s place, the clear night star-filled, the city bustling\
  \ in the darkness, the looming feeling of emptiness triggered.\nAs I boarded the\
  \ bus back to the train station, passing through sleeping villages, playgrounds\
  \ seemingly guarded by insurmountable gates and multiplying coffeeshops with bleary-eyed\
  \ Italians standing at the bar, I thought my trip to Naples had been life-changing.\
  \ Abruptly, the loud speakers announced the inevitable arrival and subsequent departure\
  \ of that which would irreparably take me away from my forbidden love. The pain\
  \ hit me bluntly as I got lost in his warm embrace."
