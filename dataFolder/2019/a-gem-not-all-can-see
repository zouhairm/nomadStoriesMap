Text: "When my exceptionally well-travelled fianc\xE9 surprised me by advising that\
  \ she had booked a long weekend trip to Malta, I can honestly say that at the precise\
  \ moment of this announcement, I was not exactly brimming with an unbridled sense\
  \ of urgency to throw my weekend bag over my shoulder and dash to the airport.\n\
  \nI won't be making that mistake again.\n\nDon't get me wrong, in fairness to this\
  \ little archipelago hugging the coast of Africa, it's not that I had never heard\
  \ positive stories about people's experiences there: my lack of enthusiasm stemmed\
  \ from my own lack of knowledge about what Malta had to offer the traveller seeking\
  \ that little bit more than plain old sun, sea and sand. \n\nThe great irony to\
  \ behold is that to find sand in Malta is like a Yukon prospector finding a solid\
  \ nugget of gold: don't visit Malta for a beach holiday; you'll be disappointed.\
  \ Visit Malta to be enchanted by a beauty and culture that you cannot possibly expect\
  \ unless you've been before.\n\nMalta is an interesting phenomenon. The island is\
  \ an infusion of classic \"Mediterranea\", with an exotic twist of Byzantine Turkey\
  \ and a dash of, dare I say it, British sensibility.  With its tall, narrow streets\
  \ laced with sun-blushed stone bricks, multi-coloured balconies, and elderly gentlemen\
  \ dressed in beige clothes socialising and reminiscing on street corners, Malta\
  \ has the unmistakable ability to make you think you are walking along a Venetian\
  \ side-street or rural Italian village. Whilst the countless \"Pastizzerias\" serving\
  \ delicious pastries and quick, delectable street food wedged amongst the skyline\
  \ of religious architecture places you firmly on the corner of a busy food market\
  \ in Istanbul. Throw in the British plug sockets, the cars driving on the left hand\
  \ side of the road, and the official language of English emblazoned on all public\
  \ places, you really start to get an impression of just how culturally diverse Malta\
  \ really is.\n\nValetta, the nation's capital city, can only be described as having\
  \ the swagger of a place that knows it is beautiful enough to act as the hedonistic\
  \ palace of a fantasy kingdom. Watch scenes of \"King's Landing\" in \"Game of Thrones\"\
  \ and you will understand that TV producers clearly thought the same. Prepare yourself\
  \ for some Baroque delights as you wander around the immersive city walls. The entire\
  \ city is a spectacle. \n\nFor the entire time I spent in Valetta, it rained like\
  \ there'd be no tomorrow. Thunder storms boomed in the air tropically. However,\
  \ it could not have been possible for the heaviest of rain to spoil the sense of\
  \ wonder you feel when you look out across the panaromic view of the city's Grand\
  \ Harbour. It really is one of those special places where the Earth stands still.\
  \    \n\nNothing could prepare me for the magic that I experienced whilst visiting\
  \ Malta's sister island, Gozo, for the day. The island is nothing short of transcendent.\
  \ I don't exaggerate when I say that Gozo is a place you simply must see. If you\
  \ have the time, try to explore every corner of the island as possible. I could\
  \ serrenade Gozo for days with my heart-felt nostalgia but no one has time for that.\
  \ I hope to put it simply when I stress that Gozo is alive with the most majestic\
  \ visual and natural beauty believable. The place tugs at the heart and wont let\
  \ you forget it.\n\nSpecial mention does have to go to the basilica, Ta' Pinu, which\
  \ will capture your imagination as it stands imposingly all on its own with nothing\
  \ else around it. It wears the same isolated beauty as the Great Pyramids, also\
  \ giving you the same notion that it has been miraculously carved up and out of\
  \ the land by an ancient people who ought not to have been able to construct such\
  \ a wonder.\n\nIn our interconnected world filled with social media posts, I would\
  \ classify Malta as being one of the last bastions that can offer the traveller\
  \ a truly unexpected surprise. And when it comes to adventure, I think we could\
  \ all agree that there's nothing that comes much better than finding that hidden\
  \ gem not all can see."
