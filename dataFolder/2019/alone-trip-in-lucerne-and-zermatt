Text: "In the morning, I left Bayreuth by train. Taking on the road, watching the\
  \ view, and listening the music, after eight hours, I arrived the first city, Lucerne.\
  \ I took my heavy baggage and walked into the hotel. In the evening, I walked along\
  \ the river with a cup of latte for taking some pictures and enjoying the evening\
  \ time. I just kept walking on the streets and exploring the old town until arriving\
  \ at the hotel. Walking into the room and sitting on the chair, after I drank a\
  \ glass of wine and tasted the cheese, I said goodbye for the first day.\nAt 6 a.m.,\
  \ my cellphone told me that I had to wake up for the subsequent trips, going on\
  \ the Mount Titlis. With the sunrise, I walked on the Kapellbrucke. Taking on train,\
  \ after approximate one hour, I arrived at the foot of the mount. Staying in the\
  \ cable car and watching the views were wonderful for me, I even wasn't aware of\
  \ the terminal was closer to me. As I arrived at there, I walked out and watching\
  \ the magnificent scenery of Mount Titlis. That was a great masterpiece with blue\
  \ sky and white snow.  I walked on the suspension bridge and looked down the gorge\
  \ which was covered by the soft snow. Looking at the far mountains, they were as\
  \ similar as the chocolate covered by white cream. After taking some pictures, I\
  \ sat on the chairlift and across the snow. As the time ran, it was time to leave.\
  \ Hours later, I came back to Lucerne and kept exploring the city. I took on the\
  \ ship and enjoyed the laid-back time on Lucerne Lake. Out from the cabin, the wind\
  \ was heavy and cold, but I really liked it, it could help me to keep awake in the\
  \ wonderland. After staying on the ship for hours, I got off the ship and walked\
  \ to see the Lion's Monument. If expect Kapellbrucke, Lion's Monument was my favorite\
  \ landmark in Lucerne. As the night came into the world, it was time to back hotel.\
  \ Therefore, I said goodbye to the lion without any words.\nThe morning in the third\
  \ day, I walked to the train station and was on the road to Zermatt with my partner,\
  \ the heavy baggage. As usual, the time was running, I arrived at Tasch, the hotel\
  \ there was cheaper than Zermatt. And just spending ten minutes, I could go to Zermatt\
  \ by the train. After having the dinner, I ended the tired day and looked forward\
  \ to tomorrow. Next day, I took on the train to Zermatt at 6 a.m. and bought the\
  \ ticket which was to go on the Gornergrat. Then I took on the first gear train,\
  \ as the gear train moved on, I met with the triangle side of Matterhorn, but the\
  \ sun was still not ready for coming out. And then I took off the train, walked\
  \ on the Gornergrat observation point. Gradually, the sun was coming out, \nthe\
  \ golden Matterhorn seemed like a huge pyramid. I could not move my eyes from the\
  \ amazing grandeur of the mount. The temperature was almost negative 30 degrees.\
  \ Because of that, I walked into the Gornergrat Hotel, drank a cup of coffee and\
  \ cheered with Matterhorn. After out from the hotel, I took on the gear train and\
  \ readied for hiking on the snow. There was a lake, Riffelsee, and that was my final\
  \ purpose. As I moved to the lake, I was afraid of that the AMS would come to find\
  \ me. Fortunately, there was nothing happened. But, because of the deep temporary\
  \ in the winter, the lake was totally frozen and covered by the snow carpet. Although\
  \ I had no opportunity to meet the lake, I still can visit the closer side of Matterhorn.\
  \ However, it was time to say goodbye. I needed to leave Switzerland for going on\
  \ the road to Frankfurt. After arriving at Tasch, I took my baggage and checked\
  \ out from the hotel. Taking on the train to Zurich first, and then back to Germany,\
  \ I could not stop to be emotional. Bringing the contradictory mode to go on the\
  \ subsequent road."
