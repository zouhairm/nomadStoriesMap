Text: I'm a traveler and I'm obsessed with exploring new cultures, built heritage,
  food and people. Life has given me many opportunities when it comes to traveling.
  I don't have an international exposure but I've traveled throughout my country and
  it's beautiful that one country has so much divwrsi6in terms of culture, language
  and food. I'm looking forward to step out of my comfort zone and explore the country
  where I'm not familiar with the language and culture and want to explore them from
  a perspective of an architect and anthropologist through the lense of my camera.
  I am keen on exploring the build heritage and learn more about the desserts people
  of Belgium make with all the best chocolates they produce. I want to live with the
  locals and try the local eateries and listen to the music played by the roadside
  artists or the local artists in some shady club. I want to see life as a girl I've
  never experienced in my country. I want to be free, a free traveler with the bag
  pack and a camera and absolutely no pressure and issues in the life. It's just me
  and the road that's taking me to the points where I've only dreamt about going.
