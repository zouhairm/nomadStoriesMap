Text: "It was raining. Raindrops splashing around, making circles, fighting with each\
  \ other and with the solid, deep substance of the sea. All creating the impression\
  \ of being in the middle of some Water Kingdom. Dark, stormy clouds hovering above,\
  \ ready to attack, warning that these playful campaigns of water armies can beguile\
  \ us. Yet it was neither dark, grey nor gloomy. Everything has to be understood\
  \ and seen through the perspective of the orange and pink rays streaming from the\
  \ West, piercing through the rain to embrace our hot and red faces.\nThis was one\
  \ of the moments that you know you will remember until you die even before it ends.\
  \ This feeling of appreciation and gratitude for experiencing it was overwhelming\
  \ despite the nagging thought that it is not going to last forever. It was just\
  \ a sauna one could say. It was just swimming in the Baltic Sea after the sauna\
  \ during the sunset. With my friend Grisha, a Chinese middle-aged lady Lin and a\
  \ young Vietnamese guy named Duy. \nWe spent that day with Duy in Vaasa where he\
  \ showed us museums, parks, and his university. We sat in the old town square talking\
  \ about conventional medicine and its Chinese alternative while listening to buskers.\
  \ It was the first time I realised how much life and energy and happiness they bring\
  \ to any city. I felt so very grateful for their passion and skills. And Duy, he\
  \ was such a smiley person. His eyes were laughing all the time and his lips resisted\
  \ only sporadically.\nIt was Lin who introduced us to Duy. She was a small restaurant\
  \ owner who had come to Finland more than a decade ago. She lived in a flat with\
  \ her two cousins, but nevertheless invited me and my three companions to stay at\
  \ her place as well. She also introduced us to many other people. The retired lieutenant\
  \ of the Finnish Army who praised Polish cuisine, which he knew from military missions.\
  \ The English teacher who speaks eight languages, including Tibetan. The pastor\
  \ of a local Protestant church who as a good bye said: \u201CI just met these four\
  \ young travellers from far away, I do not know them and we straight away start\
  \ speaking about religion, philosophy, sense of life and the universe. It was something\
  \ exceptional. Thank you.\u201D All these conversations and glimpses into the lives\
  \ and thoughts of people we would never have imagined we would meet while experiencing\
  \ for the first time the Chinese cuisine. I had never eaten anything spicier in\
  \ my life. It was delicious. \nIt was only few days into our journey and we had\
  \ already met a lot of amazing people. But the hospitality, kindness and helpfulness\
  \ of Lin were unimaginable. She treated us like closest family. We got to know her\
  \ thanks to Samuel, whom we met few days earlier in Tallin. He was a Tanzanian living\
  \ in Vaasa and travelling in the opposite direction to ours. He saw us in the supermarket\
  \ and just asked, \u201CDo you want a companion?\u201D How little is enough to start\
  \ a new relationship with a fellow human being and how significantly such small\
  \ meetings can change the course of life, or travel. We were all waiting for the\
  \ morning transport, so we ended up discovering the capital of Estonia by night,\
  \ including some not-so-legal activities like climbing to the top of Alexander Nevsky\
  \ Cathedral using the construction ladders. \n It was only a few days of a hitchhiking\
  \ trip in Europe. It was just a couple of days of deciding in the morning what we\
  \ were going to do and not knowing what each day would bring. It was praise of spontaneity.\
  \ It was discovering the known again from a new perspective. From the perspective\
  \ of standing with a carton next to the roads for hours, of not showering, of carrying\
  \ tents and supplies in the backpacks. It was something different. \nThere, swimming\
  \ in the cold Finnish sea, I had all these in mind. It was sad to think that the\
  \ sun will set, the bath will end, and our new friends will disappear from our lives.\
  \ \nIt was just a sauna in Vaasa."
