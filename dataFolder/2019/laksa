Text: "In the heart of Singapore, columns of skyscrapers rise so sharply looking up\
  \ feels like falling. It was my first time back since my family left for Canada\
  \ when I was five.\n\n\u201CYou should go.\u201D My mother insisted. \u201CIt\u2019\
  s a part of who you are.\u201D\n\nThis trip held a special significance for me because\
  \ I was a constant outsider in Canada. \n\n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D Strangers\
  \ would ask.\n\nI would always answer Singapore, but I never knew what that meant.\n\
  \nIt was a country I had mostly learned about through my parent\u2019s stories.\
  \ I was too young to have formed a identity when we left, but it was my only answer\
  \ to the question of where I was really from. \n\nWould I feel a sense of belonging?\
  \ My first few hours weren\u2019t promising. As I stepped out of the airport, I\
  \ nearly choked on the wave of sweltering humidity surrounding me and a part of\
  \ me wished I was home.\n\nAt 24, I was the same age as my mother when she first\
  \ arrived in Singapore. I wondered if she felt the same kind of loneliness I did,\
  \ looking out into a city full of strangers and wondering where she fit in.\n\n\
  I was determined to claim my connection with Singapore. Instead of heading straight\
  \ for tourist attractions, one of the first things I did was ride the North-South\
  \ MRT line. My mother told me she often took me on this route, and I hoped to find\
  \ a sense of familiarity. However, as I watched the city flash by the window, I\
  \ was disappointed by how disconnected I still felt.\n\nI stopped at a hawker centre\
  \ for lunch, and ordered laksa, also known as Malaysian fish curry. Thick rice noodles\
  \ peeked out of a bright yellow broth, with little pools of chilli oil floating\
  \ on top. I took a bite and paused. Flavours that should have been completely foreign\
  \ drew up a memory I\u2019d forgotten. Suddenly, I was sitting by a round concrete\
  \ table in the bright sunshine, stealing shrimp from laksa in front of shadowy figures\
  \ of my parents. I felt like I had found something I didn\u2019t know I could have.\
  \ \n\nI was curious to know more about my parents, so I met with Auntie Liu, a old\
  \ friend of my mother\u2019s. Her son and I had been playmates. She greeted me with\
  \ a smile. \n\n\u201CYou look exactly the same\u201D She said. \n\n Out of patience\
  \ and kindness, she took me to Choa Chu Kang, where our families used to live. \
  \ \n\n\u201CWhat were my parents like when they were young?\u201D I asked as we\
  \ walked. \n\n\u201CYour dad was very serious, and your mom was very ladylike.\u201D\
  \ Auntie Liu told me. \u201CThe first time we saw her  was when she stepped off\
  \ the train. I remember she was holding a huge parasol to shade her from the sun.\u201D\
  \ \n\nWhen I later called my mom to tell her, she laughed. \n\n\u201CI don\u2019\
  t remember that\u201D she said. \u201CShe must have me mixed up with someone else.\u201D\
  \ \n\nAuntie Liu became my unofficial tour guide. She took me to a circular field\
  \ where we often took walks after dinner. As we wandered, I suddenly remembered\
  \ standing there with our neighbours during the Lantern Festival, holding one (dangerously)\
  \ made out of a candle in a empty Kleenex box, tied to a stick. The field had been\
  \ bathed in blue darkness, lit by the hazy glow of a paper lanterns. Tonight, it\
  \ was filled with people walking their dogs and doing their evening exercises.\n\
  \nIn the following days, I continued to stumble on little bits of my childhood.\
  \ Following a sweet, familiar smell in the mall led me to kaya waffles, filled with\
  \ sweet, coconut jam coloured green with pandan leaves. Silhouettes of geckos on\
  \ the walls reminded me of how these little shadows would appear in my bedroom,\
  \ and how they used to frighten me. As I listened bits of conversation in Malay,\
  \ English, Mandarin and Tamil, I remembered how we sang the national anthem in three\
  \ different languages every morning. \n\n And piece by piece, I put together a part\
  \ of myself I hadn\u2019t realized was missing."
