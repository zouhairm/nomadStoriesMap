Text: "Since I remember when I was a girl I started traveling with my family and I\
  \ just enjoy the feeling to be preparing the suitcases and the feeling of being\
  \ at the airport waiting for the flight looking out the window to see the airplanes.\
  \ \nLast year I\u2019ve just decided to travel for 10 days by myself because none\
  \ of my friends couldn\u2019t come with me; so I said well let\u2019s do this ,\
  \ I\u2019ll go anyway to discover new places, meet new people, to taste the food\
  \ and get to know more of the culture of those places. And also I\u2019ll find more\
  \ about how I am and I\u2019m my best partner in crime. \nSo I took the plane from\
  \ Dublin Ireland where I was living at that time and I flew to Dubrovnik in Croacia.\
  \ Since I arrived I was excited but at the same time nervous of what I was going\
  \ to do that many days on my own.... \nSo there I was on a new place in a new country\
  \ for me!\nI started to discover the city and all the absolutely amazing history\
  \ of the place, the wonderful views from the old place and the sea and when I started\
  \ to hear the tour guide saying all the impressive stories of his country my imagination\
  \ flew and I felt like I was living all that as if I was reading a book but better\
  \ than that because I was there.\nI discover that the Croatian people is very friendly\
  \ as well and that they like to celebrate, sing and dance on the streets infront\
  \ of everybody just as they are infront of all the tourists showing their way of\
  \ life as I saw a new married couple and all their friends following them and celebrating\
  \ with the Croatian flag their new marriage; when I was sitting drinking a coffee\
  \ enjoying the view, the wind and the happiest feeling of all those people living\
  \ in their country and sharing with the rest....\nI took after 2 days the bus because\
  \ they said the train was the worse transportation there (laughs) so I took the\
  \ advice and I went by bus to my next stop in Split where it was raining and I took\
  \ a cab to go to my hotel and when I realize it was so close from the bus station\
  \ that I could walk (laugh) for next time I know that and the taxi driver very friendly\
  \ giving me advices and telling me a bit about the place. Next day I woke up early\
  \ excited to see more about the city beside the sea and to hear more stories about\
  \ how the place was built and I met a local and gentle guy who was my tourist guide\
  \ for that day and also who invited me for a coffee and tasty local food which I\
  \ enjoyed a lot and it was funny that he was also an amazing photographer who took\
  \ me million of professional pictures that I loved because I love to have great\
  \ photos to remember where I\u2019ve been to and to show the amazing places we may\
  \ find around the world. This guy showed me also places where the tourist people\
  \ as me we don\u2019t know that exists and we don\u2019t go . He showed me his love\
  \ for the cats and how the people in the city feed them and how they take care of\
  \ them. Also I discover how clean and safety is Croatia I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ that is one of the safiest countries not only in Europe also around the world\
  \ and after this brief I wanted to stay more days in this fascinating city but the\
  \ bus was waiting for me to take me to my next destination that was Zadar going\
  \ to the north. In Zadar I took another cab to go to the apartment where I was going\
  \ to stay in the heart of Zadar another city which I\u2019ve heard that is full\
  \ of stories and also I wanted to see and to hear the sea organ and that\u2019s\
  \ how my story will continue ...."
