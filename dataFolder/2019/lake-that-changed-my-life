Text: "A trip to Ladakh was on my mind when I joined my first ever job in an information\
  \ industry. I was able to save in bits after getting all of my salary blown on my\
  \ food cravings and other daily needs. After waiting for two long years of the idea\
  \ of Ladakh, I confirmed the trip with a friend and started with my research to\
  \ make my first ever trip a perfect and organized much itinerary that will not be\
  \ heavy for our budget as well. I did not want to make any mistakes as the trip\
  \ was my first ever get away and also in the Northern Mountains of India; also because\
  \ the whole responsibility of the plan was on me. I did not want to come home without\
  \ a perfect vacation break. I did some research on the necessary things to keep\
  \ in mind while riding off-roads and prepared an itinerary of the whole trip. I\
  \ had the best routes sorted out for our road trip (I must admit, Himalayan bike\
  \ was proving itself as a beast throughout the road trip and I can feel some love\
  \ for my friend for having this riding idea J). We made really good bookings for\
  \ the stay and we had a great team of riders joining us from Srinagar till Ladakh!\
  \ So we were all set to hit the roads in the North.\n\nMany little experiences and\
  \ the twirling roads were enough to make it a worthy trip taken on a bike as the\
  \ turns of Sonmarg, Kargil and all the high altitude passes revealed their mighty\
  \ existence on all the sides, miles long. Ladakh is truly astonishing for the peace\
  \ and colours of life it holds for the geological land it covers! Throughout the\
  \ trip, I was excited about seeing the Pangong Lake for its clear Bluewater. Once\
  \ we reached there after 8 hours of the hefty ride, I could see the two blue of\
  \ the water differentiating with the Sky just by a string of the black Rocky Mountains\
  \ visible sitting at its other shore. I took a second to soak in, to feel the beauty\
  \ of the sight. Standing by the shore, I zoned out to be with my inner peace which\
  \ I was seeking since so long. Without further ado, in seconds, I removed my shoes\
  \ and socks and all the other riding gears which were making me feel heavy.\n\uFFFC\
  \nAt Pangong tso Lake\n\nI started walking by the shore, bare feet, just to get\
  \ that sound of the breeze pass by me. I let it play with my hair and my hair responded\
  \ to her as it wanted to in return. I started my walk in thoughts and soon after\
  \ a couple of minutes, all the thoughts started fading and I was left alone with\
  \ the breeze doing all the talking for us both. I was quiet for some time. No thoughts,\
  \ no feelings, no memories, no worries, nothing! The silence was uninterrupted for\
  \ a long hour and I still remember the sound of the tiny tides the clear water made\
  \ when I listened to my instinct for the first time.\n\nI started thinking of travelling\
  \ more because it brings me closer to my inner self. I zone out, only to be with\
  \ the inner me. That place, that time, those moments, nothing repeats and nothing\
  \ can stop me from enjoying these.\n\nI learned to listen to my instinct since the\
  \ day; only to feel real!"
