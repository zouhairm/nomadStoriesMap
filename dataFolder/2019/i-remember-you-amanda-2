Text: "Marina had started crying around the bonfire. I quite understood why: it was\
  \ a beautiful night, surrounded by nature, volcanoes and a Chilean troubadour singing\
  \ a sad and sweet Spanish lullaby, just accompanied by his guitar and fingers. We\
  \ had had some wine as well; \u201Cyes\u201D, I assured myself again \u201CI totally\
  \ understand why\u201D. I was wrong.\n\n-          That was my dad\u2019s favorite\
  \ song \u2013 she said after we both coincided in the same corner for smoking a\
  \ cigarette.\n-          It is enchanting, is it a famous song here?\n-        \
  \  Kind of.\n\n\u201CTe recuerdo Amanda\u201D is a song by Chilean folk singer Victor\
  \ Jara. During Salvador Allende\u2019s presidential candidacy, he was a key contributor\
  \ to his socialist campaign; he represented a revolution as a leader of a massive\
  \ amount of people who identified with the movement and dreamed of a better future\
  \ for themselves. Victor was brutally killed in 1973, when Pinochet took the presidency\
  \ after a military coup, along with other three thousand during his government.\n\
  \n-          Some people say this event was necessary. The country was going through\
  \ a really serious economic crisis \u2013 she added. I could tell some anger through\
  \ her eyes and, although I was about to say something, I remained silent.\n\nI had\
  \ never felt quite comfortable with the idea of communism. Judging by the examples\
  \ I have heard of, it is only a utopia that ends up in disaster: the thirst and\
  \ hunger in North Korea, the extreme poverty in Cuba. In Venezuela people are either\
  \ escaping the country or dying every day, and all you wish is for someone to step\
  \ in and fix the country. That is what some people argue about Pinochet.\n\n-  \
  \        \u201CPinochet saved us from Marxism\u201D, \u201CPinochet is our Hero\u201D\
  , \u201Che saved the economy\u201D.\n\nShe was still speaking, remembering newspapers\u2019\
  \ highlights; I was nodding my head. Inside of me, there was growing some angriness,\
  \ the angriness to admit that I somehow agreed.\n\nEarlier that day I was walking\
  \ though Santiago\u2019s streets, and I couldn\u2019t help but telling how far away\
  \ economically it was from my own country, or the other countries I had visited\
  \ in the region. There were amazing highways, fancy buildings in an apparently large\
  \ and imposing financial area. I didn\u2019t fall sick, but I had also heard it\
  \ has one of the most effective health systems in the world, with pretty decent\
  \ public health facilities. After all, Pinochet might be seen as a \u201Cnecessary\
  \ evil\u201D for most of Chilean population nowadays, and the people who died, as\
  \ \u201Cjust an unfortunate number\u201D.\n\n-          Thank you for telling me\
  \ this story \u2013 I finally said, before going back to my hostel. I was still\
  \ hesitant to share any type of my political views, so I didn\u2019t add anything.\n\
  -          You are welcome. You know part of my story as well now.\n-          Did\
  \ you know Victor?\n-          My dad died the same day. He was not a socialist,\
  \ but a professor in the University where Victor was murdered. They killed everyone.\n\
  \ \nI came back to my hostel alone in shock, and I put on my headphones. I wanted\
  \ to hear \u201CTe recuerdo Amanda once again\u201D. It had been my first time listening\
  \ to a Victor Jara\u2019s song, but there was something in it, so poignant and beautiful,\
  \ that I needed to hear more. I also needed to see more, so I chose a video. And\
  \ then, there he was, wearing a humble poncho, with his classical guitar on hand,\
  \ on a black and white live presentation, calmly introducing the song before singing\
  \ it. There was a hauntingly tranquility on his voice, so much passion, that it\
  \ made me wonder what other dreams he left behind aside from his art.\n\nI later\
  \ found he had a beautiful wife and a little daughter. Her name was Amanda as well.\
  \ They waited 7 days for him to come back home, before learning he was dead. His\
  \ wife even had to go to the morgue to recognize him, recognize a bleeding husband\
  \ with his mutilated hands. \u201CThe necessary evil\u201D, \u201Cjust an unfortunate\
  \ number\u201D, \u201Che saved the economy\u201D, I recalled again. This time, I\
  \ was the one who cried."
