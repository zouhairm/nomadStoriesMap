Text: "When I was thirteen, I took the greatest risk of my life and flew to Nicaragua\
  \ on a volunteer trip with twelve strangers. My passion for global change had recently\
  \ been sparked while doing a 6th grade project on a company called Free the Children.\
  \ After fundraising through several craft sales, bake sales and raffles, my mother\
  \ and I had saved up the money for me to go to Nicaragua with Free the Children\
  \ to build a school in a rural community. Although the worried feelings flooding\
  \ my young mind almost kept me from getting on the flight, before I knew it I was\
  \ Central America bound, and there was no going back! Little did I know, after 6\
  \ short hours of flying I would be immersed into a culture of people that changed\
  \ not only my life, but my views of the world forever. Admittedly, adjusting to\
  \ life in a  Nicaraguan jungle hotel took a few days- Especially for a kid who\u2019\
  s only international traveling  experience was at an all inclusive 5-star Mexican\
  \ resort! But after spending a few nights with them, the bats and bugs just seemed\
  \ like fellow hotel guests. Our first day with the Children was a day that I will\
  \ never forget as long as I live. We spent hours playing with them on the small\
  \ plot of dirt behind their school. Although the luscious green trees of the jungle\
  \ made the small community seem like paradise, they couldn\u2019t hide the heart\
  \ wrenching truth of the poverty that had struck the community. The children however\
  \ seemed uneffected by this burden, and we spent the day playing and getting to\
  \ know one another. The fearlessness of the children was shocking. We watched as\
  \ they leaped off of unstable slides and climbed over barbed wire fences, but our\
  \ hearts skipped a beat when they demonstrated how they took turns diving into a\
  \ 6-foot-deep dirt hole in their \u201Cfield\u201D. During our work days, we had\
  \ hours to bond with the kids. Although divided by language, we communicated through\
  \ laughter and play- What better way to experience a sense of community? We worked\
  \ alongside the children and they encouraged and thanked us endlessly for our small\
  \ favour. Their gratitude was heartwarming, and was expressed so beautifully. I\
  \ remember on one of our hottest, hardest work days, two young girls approached\
  \ me while I was pick axing in the \u201Cfield\u201D. One way or another we began\
  \ playing, and eventually the girls decided to style my hair. The two of them, no\
  \ more than four and six years old, braided my hair twhile the three of us laughed\
  \ together in the sun. Once finished, they secured the braid with a twist of barbed\
  \ wire. While in Managua, Nicaragua\u2019s capital, I saw heartbreaking examples\
  \ of poverty within communities.  Emaciated animals wandered the streets, young\
  \ children attempted to sell cheap trinkets, however the most impactful experience\
  \ of my trip was when I met two siblings near the school. Neither of the children\
  \ were attending the school. The boy, Don Marcito, was two and therefore too young,\
  \ his 12 year old sister was not permitted to attend, as the family had already\
  \ invested in sending her nine year old brother to school. Don Marcito grew attached\
  \ to me quickly, and the two of us bonded over my short stay in Nicaragua. I would\
  \ carry him around for hours, the two of us simply giggling and enjoying our environment.\
  \ Saying goodbye to Don Marcito was one of the most difficult goodbyes I\u2019ve\
  \ ever had to say. Leslie, his older sister, related to me the most as we were only\
  \ a year apart in age. She showed me an example of what life would be like for someone\
  \ like me in another part of the world. This was a very eye opening experience for\
  \ someone my age, and extremely overwhelming. Leslie was not given half the opportunity,\
  \ freedoms, education, safety, health services or even a chance at the life I was\
  \ so priveledged to have. I left Nicaragua with a little less luggage that week,\
  \ leaving a small token of clothing behind for the girl that forever changed me."
