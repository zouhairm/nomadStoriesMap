Text: "Rickety 'kaccha' roads lined with very few colourful 'aangans' on either side\
  \ sped past our window. Bells for lunch sounded loud from within. Yes, it was past\
  \ lunchtime as we pulled in to one of the smaller textile villages in Orissa, Olasingha\
  \ (Olasingh textile village).\n\nWith the sun beating right above our heads, we\
  \ stepped out to see not many people around. No sounds of looms ticking, work had\
  \ come to a standstill for lunch I guessed. A man, perhaps in his early 30's rushed\
  \ up to us, happily agreeing to show us around. \"How long since have you been handling\
  \ the looms?\", numbers being a fascination of a newbie research person, I asked.\
  \ His lips curled up to a faint grin, lost in some long-lost thought, \"since childhood\"\
  , he replied. Being the third or fourth generation who still continued the weaving\
  \ tradition alongside their profession for livelihood, it is to his house we went\
  \ first.\n\nDimly lit, with a loom lining the wall and an SRK movie running in the\
  \ background; a small tiled house just enough for his family of three. Amidst these\
  \ sat an older lady, his mom, spinning thread from the cocoon. A scene I've got\
  \ to witness only in documentary movies welcomed us.\n\nSoft they were, yes, but\
  \ this primitive, \u2018reel-with-your-thighs\u2019 spinning technique just popped\
  \ one question on my mind: \"Does it not hurt?\". Looking up, smiling into my camera,\
  \ she replied, \"The thread won't cut us, they're soft. But, sitting for long stretches\
  \ on the floor gives us backaches!\".\n\nWith my mom being the interviewer and me\
  \ behind the lens, time just flew past. \n\nExplanations and demos continued as\
  \ we slowly moved from the first house to their village co-operative society. It\
  \ is here that we got to see a few fairer equipment\u2019s, coloured silk, half\
  \ weaved saree\u2019s, and of course our first weaving demo. Two to three looms\
  \ were installed in the most households I was told, with both men and women equally\
  \ well equipped in weaving.\n\nMy thoughts ran wild as I saw them. Dallying, trying\
  \ to gain our attention, they were such cuties, playing and poking hands around\
  \ while the elders worked. Memories washed ashore as I stood recollecting the yesteryear\
  \ tales my dad used to narrate. Those places which he pointed out to as \u2018once\
  \ a weaver\u2019s village\u2019 don\u2019t have the faintest resemblance of one\
  \ today. Yes, most of our quaint villages along with their traditions have bowed\
  \ down to concrete jungles. In an era where invisible communities get to snatch\
  \ most of our \u2018urban\u2019 childhood days, these kids at Olasingh are still\
  \ fortunate to observe and learn tradition from their parents. \n\nIt was around\
  \ 2 pm as we wrapped up the demo sessions and interviews. A day with the weavers\
  \ was much more than any money\u2019s worth. There was happiness, there was sorrow,\
  \ and more so, anxiety in their eyes. \u201CWhat\u2019s in store for tomorrow\u201D\
  , was written all over.\n\nIndia is one of those places where handlooms still strive\
  \ but at the brim. Unfortunately, this tradition is slowly fading as the current\
  \ generation is forced to go outside of the circle in search of secured jobs and\
  \ a better lifestyle. Having come with the intention of delving more into an unknown\
  \ tradition, I can sure say I\u2019m leaving with a basket full of thoughts to nibble\
  \ upon. I ponder\u2026"
