Text: "Two girls, one from Syria and the other one from Argentina, sitting in a Spanish\
  \ nudist beach sharing a \u201CMate\u201D. Those memories that are not plan to be\
  \ created, stories which are the first to be told once we are back in what we define\
  \ as our \"comfort zone\" with our \u201Ccomfort people\u201D.\nThe best traveler\u2019\
  \ stories arise from the daily acts, the least extravagant experiences, the best\
  \ conversations...\nAnd that\u2019s how doing everything possible to extend the\
  \ hours traveling, wanting days themselves to be longer, in a place that, from the\
  \ first sight captures all our attention, clearly without having gone out until\
  \ the early hours the night before, we can woke up in the morning not complaining\
  \ in a Spanish July, when the sun is just beginning to warm up, while fans of morning\
  \ exercising, or maybe not so much, go out to put their body into operation mode.\n\
  \ Avoiding the main tourists\u2019 obstacles in Barcelona, by that meaning the bicycles\
  \ circulating without any kind of impediment through, undoubtedly, one of the most\
  \ touristic places in the city, La Barceloneta. Such tranquility, the sound of insignificant\
  \ waves crashing on the coast seem to be the most harmonic song on my playlist,\
  \ luckily not interrupt by any ad nor tourists hunters offering with a well-marked\
  \ accent \u201Cbeer, aqua\u201D or even mojitos as if it\u2019s an ideal option\
  \ at this time.\nNothing goes better with a day in a city to discover than before\
  \ diving all into the new culture, start with an extension of a routine for each\
  \ of us, in this case one from the opposite hemisphere, drinking \u201CMate\u201D\
  , enjoying what the argentines proudly and, in sort of selfish a way, defend as\
  \ a their own local drink. \nThe hours goes by, sun heats up more and more, sunscreen\
  \ protection factor should be higher, beach hustle begins to emerge, the insignificant\
  \ hot water left in the thermo has been refilled and an accent, that I have never\
  \ heard before, surprises me with its query, wondering if a supermarket before heading\
  \ to the beach sold me the breakfast I am having; between surprised and confused\
  \ I explain that it\u2019s typical of South America and has traveled with me from\
  \ Argentina. Yet to be fully understanding each other, we are doing our best trying\
  \ to communicate\u2026 she explains that\u2019s very familiar with what I am drinking\
  \ and how her version to enjoy it in Syria is.\nIn a general perspective, whether\
  \ you know some facts about other countries or even continents, those are not expected\
  \ topics to have in common while traveling, it isn't the classic conversation of\
  \  which places you have visited, how long you\u2019ve been traveling for, explaining\
  \ that you're from the southern hemisphere and in response getting a surprise face\
  \ questioning how many hours your flight has taken to land in Europe; are those\
  \ moments that allow you confirm that no matter how much you think it is the most\
  \ common routine to you, it keeps surprising yourself and, at the same time, it\
  \ might teach something unknown.\nIt only took Lina a few seconds to go get her\
  \ mandala print towel  (clearly bought minutes before sitting on the sand) with\
  \ her backpack on the shoulder and settled down next to me, to spend non-timed time\
  \ sharing, between hand signs, gestures and words in a non-native language for both,\
  \ our own version of how the \u201CMate\u201D was; but that time, unlike how Lina\
  \ explained me the Syrian tradition was, we shared an argentine version, sharing\
  \ the cup and the specific straw for it not only the thermo.\nThat\u2019s how things\
  \ just happen; hours and hours turn ephemeral, each one energetically sharing our\
  \ small cultural portion from opposite sides of the globe. It's all about sharing\
  \ the experience itself, more than the information, the fact of finding all in a\
  \ sudden, in an unexpected way, what probably in most cases, turns out to be the\
  \ best company of the day, even of the week, the month or of a whole trip. The satisfaction\
  \ of opening up to new ways, new ideas, and if not taking them as our own, allow\
  \ ourselves to accept and understand them."
