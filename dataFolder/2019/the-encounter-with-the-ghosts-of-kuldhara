Text: "Exploring the Great Indian desert was definitely in my bucket list since I\
  \ was 15. Ohh! The feeling of being close to the culture, the Rajasthani dance,\
  \ the legendary puppet-show, rising turbans and falling ghungats all around was\
  \ just apt to make the time go still for a while. Let me savour the joy of being\
  \ an Indian. I had finally managed a trip to Rajasthan for 10 days. The evening\
  \ tea in the garden of my hotel was gratifying enough till a conversation with the\
  \ receptionist rushed a chill down my spine. He was a permanent inhabitant since\
  \ birth and had heard many a times strange voices from distant villages. Kuldhara,\
  \ he stated, is a habitat for many ghosts since the dawn of time. Finally able to\
  \ make this far, I could have never went back without visiting the land of ghosts.\
  \ We postponed our next stop \u2018Jodhpur\u2019 to encounter the so-called \u2018\
  ghost land'. \nWith the first flush of the morning, I struggled my way out of the\
  \ bed to make the most of my last day in Jaiselmer. On that extremely chilly morning,\
  \ sitting on the frigid sand froze me from within but watching the serene sun rise\
  \ was immensely palliative.\nPack your bags! We are about to leave for kuldhara\
  \ just after the breakfast. The place was not allowed to be visited after sunset\
  \ by the government as the ghosts were said to roam around the entire place. This\
  \ was an important suggestion given by the receptionist and we had to buck up now\
  \ to get the best experience of the haunted village. 20 km to the west of Jaiselmer,\
  \ we travelled through wide stretches of barren land. Being hardly any sign of human\
  \ inhabitant around, Google baba was the only one to rely on for the directions.\
  \ But when you are panic-struck enough, what adds to the flavour is wrong directions\
  \ by Google Maps. After 300m turn left and we did! No constructed road, rarely any\
  \ plantation or sign of animal around. A wave of chill swayed over me. OMG! I just\
  \ saw a skeleton of bull lying just near my car. Where the hell is Google taking\
  \ us? Is it the apt way to reach. And a superb add-on to the situation was Google\
  \ getting dumb in the mid of desert with no idea where to head on further. Without\
  \ wasting anymore time further, we drove back along the same route for additional\
  \ 2 hours we wasted and finally reached the appropriate turn we had to take being\
  \ guided by some local shepherds whom we met by God\u2019s grace. Travelling the\
  \ next relaxing 20 min of my life, we finally reached the famous haunted village.\
  \ \nThose 2 little village boys who were standing near the entrance asked for just\
  \ a meagre amount of money to recite the entire story of kuldhara. \nKuldhara was\
  \ actually the home for Paliwal Brahmins who lived here around 200 years ago. Just\
  \ before the village got abandoned, the Brahmins were leading a hounded life under\
  \ the influence of the ruler of that era who used to grab enormous taxes from them.\
  \ Adding to the misery, the ruler got an eye on one of the brahmin's daughter, probably\
  \ the chief's daughter. And if they denied of giving her to the ruler, they would\
  \ have to pay double the taxes. One last day was left for the Brahmins to decide\
  \ and they had no other option rather than to flee from the village overnight. Since\
  \ then, the village is in the stance as it was left. \nRumours are around that the\
  \ village has been cursed by the Brahmins that it would never get flourished in\
  \ future. And if someone plans to spend a night in the village, he or she is never\
  \ ever seen again! This is so horrifying! Where does the person go, he vanishes\
  \ in the air or gets buried in the earth. Nobody knows! And I think will never get\
  \ to know. \nBut once I enter the deserted village, I could feel something supernatural\
  \ around me. Something was following me, maybe someone peeping from the window,\
  \ something really petrifying. God knows!"
