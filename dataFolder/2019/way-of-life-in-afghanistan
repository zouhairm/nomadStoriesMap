Text: "Although the Afghan population is composed of many distinct ethnic groups,\
  \ certain elements of their way of life are much the same. Characteristically, the\
  \ family is the mainstay of Afghan society. Extremely close bonds exist within the\
  \ family, which consists of the members of several generations. The family is headed\
  \ by the oldest man, or patriarch, whose word is law for the whole family. Family\
  \ honor, pride, and respect toward other members are highly prized qualities. Among\
  \ both villagers and nomads the family lives together and forms a self-sufficient\
  \ group. In the villages each family generally occupies either one mud-brick house\
  \ or a walled compound containing mud-brick or stonewalled houses. The same pattern\
  \ prevails among the nomads, except that tents replace the houses.\nSettlements\
  \ in Afghanistan with less than 100 houses number over 10,000 and those with 100\
  \ to 250 houses number about 1000. There are 53 urban centers that range in size\
  \ from 2500 to 25,000 people. In the smaller villages there are no schools, no stores,\
  \ nor any representative of the government. Each village has three sources of authority\
  \ within it: the malik (village headman), the mirab (master of the water distribution),\
  \ and the mullah (teacher of Islamic laws). Commonly a khan (large landowner) will\
  \ control the whole village by assuming the role of both malik and mirab.\n\nBaggy\
  \ cotton trousers are a standard part of the Afghan villager's costume. The men\
  \ wear long cotton shirts, which hang over their trousers, and wide sashes around\
  \ their waists. They also wear a skullcap, and over that, a turban, which they take\
  \ off when working in the fields. The women wear a long loose shirt or a high-bodice\
  \ dress with a swirling skirt over their trousers; they drape a wide shawl about\
  \ their heads. Many women wear jewelry, which is collected as a form of family wealth.\
  \ When urban women leave their houses they usually wear a burka or shadier, a long\
  \ tentlike veil that covers them from head to foot. Women in villages seldom wear\
  \ the burka, and educated urban women discarded the custom, especially under Soviet\
  \ domination where it was regarded as backward.\n\nThe diet of most Afghan villagers\
  \ consists mainly of unleavened flat bread called nan, soups, a kind of yogurt called\
  \ mast, vegetables, fruit, and occasionally rice and meat. Tea is the favorite drink.\n\
  \nVillage men work in the fields, joined by the women during the harvest. Older\
  \ children tend the flocks and look after the smaller children. The village mosque\
  \ is the center of religious life and is often used as the village guest house.\n\
  \nTwice a year groups of nomads may pass through villages on their routes from summer\
  \ highland grazing grounds to the lowlands where they camp during the winter. The\
  \ villagers traditionally permit the nomads to graze their animals over the harvested\
  \ fields, which the flocks fertilize by depositing manure. The nomads buy supplies\
  \ such as tea, wheat, and kerosene from the villagers; the villagers buy wool and\
  \ milk products from the nomads. For food and clothing, the nomads depend on the\
  \ milk products, meat, wool, and skins of their flocks; for transportation they\
  \ depend on their camels. Nomadic women are freer and less secluded than the village\
  \ women.\n\nA favorite sport in northern Afghanistan is a game called buzkashi,\
  \ in which teams of horsemen compete to deposit the carcass of a large headless\
  \ calf in a goal circle. Afghans also play polo and ghosai, a team sport similar\
  \ to wrestling. The most important holiday in Afghanistan is Eid and Nowruz, or\
  \ New Year's Day, which is celebrated on the first day of spring.\n\nthough daily\
  \ and hard war in Afghanistan the people are tired of living in Afghanistan in these\
  \ centuries of war in Afghanistan many people lost there sons and many people lost\
  \ there many more relatives and it caused the people to change the ways of life\
  \ in Afghanistan. nowadays because of war in Afghanistan many of population of Afghanistan\
  \ are dying daily and are tired of war they want a relax life and peace and there\
  \ for many people leave Afghanistan and the go to europ and many other countries\
  \ illegally. \n\nmost regards... \nMohammad Ajmal Niaziwal"
