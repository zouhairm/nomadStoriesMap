Text: "It is only when the car begins its rapid ascent into the hilly town of Mussoorie\
  \ in India that I consider the purpose of my trip. Our dusty wagon is making its\
  \ peregrinations with a certain sense of doggedness. Here goes Dehradun, the newly\
  \ established capital of this hilly state. Here starts the majestic Shivalik mountain\
  \ range. And here, we pass a sign that offers discounted trips to see the famed\
  \ Himalyan snow leopard. But I am in pursuit of a creature much more elusive than\
  \ the big cat. The subject of my hunt is the children\u2019s writer native to this\
  \ region: Mr. Ruskin Bond. Like countless other Indians, I grew up reading him.\
  \ It is only when I enter his terrain that he reveals himself anew; coyer, shiftier\
  \ and a great deal harder to catch than any endangered species. \n \nMy hunt threatens\
  \ to begin on an embarrassing note. The pickings are slim. Sightings of the great\
  \ writer are few and far between. Local gossip tells me that the man has turned\
  \ reclusive. Opinion is divided on where he was last seen. Still, I am welcome to\
  \ try. Between the noisy tourists from New Delhi and the demanding wedding party\
  \ that has just entered town, my hunt offers a spot of good cheer to the locals.\
  \ \n\nMy itinerary is set. I am to begin at dawn. Rumour has it that Mr. Bond is\
  \ known to frequent the grassy knolls of Lal Tibba. Perhaps I can surprise the master\
  \ while he hangs upside-down after a good session of yoga. I must approach carefully\
  \ and soundlessly. Any untoward noise is likely to send the target scrambling back\
  \ to the warm safety of his cottage. My perambulations prove unsuccessful. Mr. Bond\
  \ is nowhere to be seen! \n\u201CMadam\u201D, begins the portly hotel concierge,\
  \ \u201CWhy don\u2019t you try the Cambridge book depot?\u201D He signs books there,\
  \ I\u2019m told. Good idea! It is imperative that I catch him in his natural habitat.\
  \ I must not go unprepared this time. On comes the gear, the camera, the first edition\
  \ copy of \u2018A Flight of Pigeons\u2019. If he flees my trap without warning,\
  \ I can always catch a hint of his silhouette with a well-timed selfie.\n\nAlas\
  \ and alack! The great Ruskin does not make his customary appearance. At this rate,\
  \ I\u2019d rather take up the hairstylist\u2019s offer of going into big cat territory.\
  \ Something tells me that snow leopards are less likely to reject my pleas for an\
  \ autograph. Or have I been speaking to the wrong people this entire time? Perhaps\
  \ I should settle down and send a silent prayer to the characters from Mr. Bond\u2019\
  s books. \n\nIn time, the slightly dishevelled ghost of Pahari Wilson makes an appearance.\
  \ He is notorious around these parts for abandoning the British army and choosing\
  \ to go native, a la Kurtz. I cannot hide my disappointment. I would have preferred\
  \ a more sober ghost, not this unreliable showman. \u201CHic\u201D, says Wilson,\
  \ \u201CThe old boy is known to frequent the writer\u2019s bar for a peg of hot\
  \ whisky...Wouldn\u2019t mind one meself\u201D. Truly dejected now, I give up on\
  \ finding Bond and start for the bar. Plus, who doesn\u2019t like a glass of hot\
  \ whisky? \n\nThe hills called me and I returned their call. The hunt remains unfinished;\
  \ I will not have my requisite trophy for Instagram. What I will have instead, is\
  \ a meal at The Savoy duly catalogued by hashtags. \u201CDon\u2019t you see what\
  \ is around you?\u201D says a gentle voice by my elbow. It is the apparition of\
  \ my dreams and the erstwhile lady of the hills, Gulabi. \n\nThrough her eyes, I\
  \ look and I see Ruskin\u2019s Mussoorie. On my left, I see the present. I see enthusiastic\
  \ pilgrims on their way to the Shiva temple. On my right, I see the past. The last\
  \ few soldiers from the British cantonment are packing up, leaving their home on\
  \ the eve of India\u2019s independence. Joining them both is the invisible ink that\
  \ illuminates Ruskin\u2019s world. \u201CYou only had to look at the trees\u201D\
  , whispers Gulabi, laughing at me. She\u2019s right. The trees he planted still\
  \ grow here. They hold secrets that are more than a hundred years old."
