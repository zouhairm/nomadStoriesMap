Text: "The Hidden Identity\nSome people used to say: the greatest adventure in life\
  \ is discovering who you are. Our identity is very important because it describes\
  \ ones view about them, which for some determines what they choose to be committed\
  \ to in life. \nSo, the question is who am I?\n\nIf what I do defines me, I\u2019\
  d constantly judge my worth based on my profession. If what I\u2019ve achieved defines\
  \ me, the success or the failures would tell me what my worth is. If what others\
  \ think of me defines who I am, I\u2019d definitely try to please everyone. \nThe\
  \ true inner self is always conveyed through self-knowledge and self-esteem which\
  \ appears through the human journey in life.\nYet, long ago, William Shakespeare\
  \ in \u201CAs you like it\u201D had noticed this fact by stating \u201CAll the world\u2019\
  s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.\u201D \n\n-\tThe search begins\
  \ \n\u201CThat\u2019s a very restricting question, because this is a country that\
  \ was built by immigrants\u201D. Those immigrants were originally English, German,\
  \ Swedes, and Eastern Europeans, he added. \u201CThe problem of creating an identity\
  \ is crucial issues from the very beginning of the subtle.\u201D Professor Naom\
  \ Chomsky when asked to identify the American identity.\nBased on that, I decided\
  \ to start my own search journey to people no one thought of their identity. The\
  \ route was to Egyptian Bedouins of Sinai.\n\nPhoto journalist Linda Horowitz said\
  \ at her \u201CWhile the Sands Whisper\u201D novel \u201CA Bedouin is as fast as\
  \ the wind, hard as a rock, soft as the sea and forever free.\u201D Linda, who spent\
  \ three years in Africa, seven months in Sinai, described her stay in the peninsula\
  \ and how she met her Bedouin guide \"Hakim\" and what draws them both into \"a\
  \ taboo love affair\" as she stated. \nI\u2019ve never been able to meet a real\
  \ Bedouin. Portrayal of people living years ago in the desert is the first thing\
  \ that came to my mind when hearing \u201CBedouins\u201D. What really surprised\
  \ me is when I heard that brand new, unique, and first ever combination of Egyptians;\
  \ The Romanian Egyptian Bedouins. \n\n\n-\tClose view \nTheir story begins in the\
  \ fifth century when Justinian the First, Roman emperor, ordered a group of soldiers\
  \ from parts of what is called now Romania, to accompany the priests who were going\
  \ to the holy spot that witnessed God's trodden. Relatively, with the help from\
  \ those soldiers, the priests built a monastery and church within a defensive wall.\
  \ \nMany believe that soldiers were amid hundreds in total and their job was to\
  \ protect the monastery from the aggressors. Later, their Romanian race had been\
  \ mixed with Arab travelers, Africans and some places from Upper Egypt. \n\nAl-Jebaliya\
  \ tribe was founded by their descendants who announced it \"the tribe responsible\
  \ for protecting the monastery\". That didn\u2019t change even after converting\
  \ to Islam in the sixth century. Al-Jebaliya \"from the mountain\" is located in\
  \ the mountains of the southern side of Sinai. Also, they have learned how to enhance\
  \ their very few natural resources available by learning the terrain by the inch.\
  \ They also have special admiration to nature, as their say \u201CIf you kill a\
  \ tree, you kill a soul.\"  Their community has unique traditions related to each\
  \ stage of their life cycle.  \n\nI tried to examine the life cycle of al-Jebaliya\
  \ tribe by walking in the wonderful paths which they used hundreds of years ago.\
  \ The desert there is not the regular image that is usually stick in our minds;\
  \ desolate, arid and barren, but it is more like a garden of colorful rocks, aromatic\
  \ herbs, and sometimes animals.\n\n-\tLeaving time\nAl-Jebaliya tribe is characterized\
  \ by conservative people with wealth knowledge of their culture and environment.\
  \ There is no doubt they have succeeded in preserving their identity and traditional\
  \ values are still alive. \nAs I spent nights and days in this remarkable place\
  \ accompanied by those pure and amazingly clever people, I became aware of the actual\
  \ meaning of the word Heaven and what it means to be expelled from Paradise. \n\
  Only then, one can understand the logic of the three religions in one place; Saint\
  \ Catherine city whose concept of essence isn\u2019t clearly acknowledged by dwellers."
