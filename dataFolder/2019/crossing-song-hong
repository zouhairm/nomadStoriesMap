Text: "Upon leaving Noi Bai Airport, H\xE0 N\u1ED9i welcomes us into its lively green\
  \ heart of fig trees and colourful, haphazardly stacked balconies overflowing with\
  \ tropical plant life. As we weave through the hum of the traffic, we glimpse the\
  \ changing scale of the city. From wide tree lined boulevards with monumental French\
  \ Colonial mansions to dense low rise mixed-use neighbourhoods spilling off narrow\
  \ and winding alleyways, the tumultuous history of H\xE0 N\u1ED9i is visibly evident\
  \ in its urban fabric. Thrown into the mix is the abundance of towering trees which\
  \ consume the streets and all who inhabit them; an early 2000\u2019s government\
  \ strategy to make H\xE0 N\u1ED9i a more liveable and sustainable city through the\
  \ planting of one million trees by 2020.\n\nWe begin exploring H\xE0 N\u1ED9i by\
  \ visiting the river that bounds the city\u2019s east, S\xF4ng H\u1ED3ng, and the\
  \ bridge that traverses it. Cau Long Bien was the longest steel bridge in Asia at\
  \ its time and has been rebuilt several times since, paying homage to the resilience\
  \ of the Vietnamese spirit throughout the country\u2019s war stricken years. The\
  \ beginning of the bridge rises from a patchwork of produce markets, French colonial\
  \ white parapets and air conditioners, several busy roads back from the river. A\
  \ woman clad in denim and floral prints combined with a staple of the Vietnamese\
  \ people, the n\xF3n l\xE1 (leaf hat), slowly pushes her pineapple-laden bicycle\
  \ down the middle of the busy street. Her bicycle is decorated with the spikey fruit,\
  \ overflowing the baskets on the front with a chopping board of cut golden wedges\
  \ balanced on top at the ready. Eyes always searching, waiting for any sign of curiosity\
  \ or interest from someone passing by.\n\nAs we cross the bridge we see Vietnamese\
  \ women carrying bamboo poles that balance woven baskets of bananas in front and\
  \ behind them, employing a quick shuffle to ease the weight of the produce. Roads\
  \ straddle the railway on either side with swarms of traffic heaving to and from\
  \ the city centre. The bridge belongs to the motorbike and the scooter, each adorned\
  \ with a medley of fruits, vegetables, nets, bottles, cardboard boxes, livestock,\
  \ and blankets. Every load three times as wide as the captain of the bike. \n\n\
  As we leave the urban jungle of the riverbanks behind, we enter farmlands of banana\
  \ plantations and zucchini crops. A tropical oasis of dense greenery sits in the\
  \ middle of the riverbanks. Winding dirt paths connect the crops and the descent\
  \ into the leafy sandbank quickly mutes the drum of the city and the pulsing sounds\
  \ of the bikes rushing across the bridge above. Asher waves to a local man on the\
  \ periphery of the zucchini crop only to realise he\u2019s defecating and quickly\
  \ shuffles away behind some banana leaves for a sliver of privacy.\n\nThe river\
  \ fades into the smog of the city that blurs the line of the horizon into a haze\
  \ of brown and white; of coffee and condensed milk. Remnants of the past that have\
  \ fallen by the wayside serve as a reminder of the war that ravaged the country\
  \ some sixty years ago. Dredging barges drift below and fisherman paddle their small\
  \ wooden boats feet first with exquisite ease, meandering through the concrete and\
  \ steel shards of the old bridge that pierce the milky depths. \n\nOn the opposite\
  \ bank of Yen Tan, footsteps are quickly lost in the alleyways of colourful suburban\
  \ terraces. Curious faces poke out of mint green shuttered doorways and xin caos\
  \ are answered with smiles and nods. It\u2019s a Saturday and children are playing\
  \ with basketballs in the street while dogs snooze lazily on the warm pavement.\
  \ The air is thick with humidity and many retreat into cool dimly lit cafes. Even\
  \ in their depths, you\u2019ll always be connected to the pulse of the city, the\
  \ hum of the motorbikes, the beeping of the horns, the drumming of the exhaust,\
  \ the rhythm of the engine."
