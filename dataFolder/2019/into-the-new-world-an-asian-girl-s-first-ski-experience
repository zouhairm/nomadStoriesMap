Text: "This trip was all about \u201Cfirsts\u201D. We recently traveled to Canada.\
  \ A first for me to be in this country. Although I was traveling with someone, I\
  \ am still that kind of person who takes extra caution when going to the unknown,\
  \ or a place I have never been to before. \n\nWe stayed in Calgary for the first\
  \ 2 days of the trip. We explored downtown Calgary, a really nice city with great\
  \ modern architectural buildings. I suggest going on two different days to really\
  \ get the most out of the city. \n\nPeople have said that you can\u2019t really\
  \ fully experience Canada unless you go skiing. So we continued our journey towards\
  \ BC to Kickin Horse Ski Mountain Resort. Prepare for an amazing and picturesque\
  \ road trip because on the way you can stop by Banff and many other lakes that are\
  \ just drop dead gorgeous. \n\nMore people come when it\u2019s not winter since\
  \ the lakes aren\u2019t frozen. But it\u2019s still pretty and there aren\u2019\
  t as many tourists when you come during winter time. \n\nFinally, we arrived at\
  \ our condominium at Kicking Horse Mountain Resort located in Golden BC. Exciting\
  \ right? Maybe not as much for me. And this is for the reason that I know I will\
  \ be facing a fear - the fear of heights and the possibility of getting physically\
  \ hurt. \n\nAt 9am we got ready for my first ever skiing lesson, we got our all-day\
  \ passes and  I started on the kiddie version known as the \u201CJelly Bean\u201D\
  . Throughout the whole time, I was scared to fall but I keep reminding myself \u201C\
  I got this\u201D. I was able to master the \u201Cpizza\u201D a term used in skiing\
  \ to slow you down. \n\nThe next day, we woke up with our bodies sore. I went again\
  \ to warm up at the kiddie version. One of the instructors invited us to go to the\
  \ chair lift and he told us he\u2019s going there soon with his student. So I agreed\
  \ to go with my husband. The moment we got into the chair lift it was the most amazing\
  \ view, snow-covered majestic mountains I tried not to look down because it\u2019\
  s gonna trigger my fear of heights. Every own skiing when I look down look like\
  \ little people.\n\nWe got to the top of the mountain 3000 ft from the ground, and\
  \ just like a child I slowly started skiing down. I was trying to do \u201Cpizza\u201D\
  \ most of the time because that\u2019s the only way I know how to do. Half-way through\
  \ my husband is getting faster and faster. I got nervous with my speed and the next\
  \ thing I know I slipped and I was rolling down the hill. I kept calling for my\
  \ husband\u2019s name but he just kept snowboarding and probably did not hear me.\
  \ \n\nPicture this, a lonely Asian girl in the middle of nowhere in the mountains\
  \ stuck and could not get up from her ski boards. After 5 minutes of trying, I finally\
  \ got up and started skiing down - slowly. There were no signs which is the easier\
  \ or harder track. So I just followed my instincts. With my speed, I soon realize\
  \ I was going the advanced track! I got more nervous because there were no skiers\
  \ in sight. I remember taking a big breath and reassuring myself the whole time\
  \ that it\u2019s going to be okay. \n\nI took it slowly and after 45 minutes of\
  \ skiing (which was supposed to be just 10 minutes if you\u2019re mediocre), the\
  \ sight of other skiers and our condominium started slowly emerging out of the trees\
  \ covered in snow. Instead of continuing to ski, I stopped took a big breath and\
  \ sat down under one of the trees. I absorbed the beauty around me and how I was\
  \ able to make it down just by myself. I felt an accomplishment and even though\
  \ I am still a beginner at this activity I know I am for another new experience!\n\
  \nCanada may not be as exotic and as exciting compared to other countries travelers\
  \ usually visit, but for me it\u2019s not really about the country it\u2019s about\
  \ the adventure and how you changed yourself after the journey."
