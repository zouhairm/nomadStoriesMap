Text: "17 years old, exuding pure innocence, uncorrupted by the world, optimistic.\
  \ I had never been away from family, even for a weekend. I had never even been out\
  \ of the country and now I was on a one-way ticket to the other side of the world.\
  \ 16 hours to a country so different from my own, with a culture and traditions\
  \ I couldn't relate to at that moment, and a language I couldn\u2019t even understand.\
  \ All alone, missing my grandfather\u2019s cooking and grandmother\u2019s love and\
  \ concern for whether I had eaten my fruits, vegetables and drank enough water that\
  \ day. How was I going to survive the next 288 days?  \n\nI hadn\u2019t previously\
  \ done my research on this new place I would now call home, so I was clueless as\
  \ to what to expect. What did I blindly get myself into? Was I ready? Well even\
  \ if I wasn\u2019t, there was no turning back now. I would have to make it work.\
  \ Mother didn\u2019t raise a quitter.  \n\nWithin 24 hours of landing, I had encountered\
  \ at least 3 challenges. The first challenge was that nobody spoke English, so survival\
  \ skill number one was to learn the language whilst perfecting my use of gestures\
  \ in the meantime. My second challenge was the fact that I had to be at least 20\
  \ years old to buy a sim card which meant I had no way of contacting my family especially\
  \ since I did not even have a laptop at that point, so survival skill number two\
  \ would be to make friends. And finally, my third challenge of the day was discovering\
  \ that I had no mattress or bedding in the dormitory that I was to be staying at,\
  \ apparently you had to bring your own.  \n\nNearly 7000 miles away from home, with\
  \ numerous culture shocks, a language barrier, food that I wasn\u2019t so sure about\
  \ and challenges that seemed to never end, I was not about to let myself to fall\
  \ into depression, so I decided to set into survival mode number two. I met and\
  \ made three friends from the US, Ukraine and El Salvador and together we explored\
  \ the city with the tenth tallest building in the world, ate some pork rice, drank\
  \ some BubbleTea, but failed to try out some stinky tofu, we just could not get\
  \ past the smell.  \n\nI fell in love with the vibrant coloured temples scattered\
  \ all over the country, the mix of mountains, rivers and lakes and coming from a\
  \ landlocked country, the ocean soon became my best friend. We hiked up Yang Ming\
  \ Shan only to discover when we got to the top that there was actually a shuttle\
  \ bus going up. Got onto a couple of wrong buses, got off a few wrong metro stations,\
  \ walked around in circles and learnt that the locals will go out of their way to\
  \ help you and make sure that you find your way to your destination safely. \n\n\
  We explored the old streets, night markets, museums, learnt how to bake sun-cakes,\
  \ make leather book markers and ride a scooter. I took a trip to the magnificent\
  \ East Coast to spend the Lunar New Year with a local family where I learnt more\
  \ about the culture and traditions and received my first ever red envelope. I spent\
  \ three days of spring break partying on the beach with the entire student population\
  \ and international artists in the South. I made and released a sky lantern in Pingxi\
  \ and enjoyed some rice dumplings whilst watching a dragon boat race at the famous\
  \ Dragon Boat Festival.  \n\nA leap into the unknown turned to self-discovery filled\
  \ with wonderful memories and numerous lessons. A travel experience became a life-changing\
  \ experience. 288 days turned to 7 years. A young girl with a dream, from the Kingdom\
  \ of eSwatini, is now a young woman who travels the world and writes about it in\
  \ hopes to inspire others to explore the world and its many beauties. I am forever\
  \ grateful to Taiwan for opening me up to the world and a whole world of possibilities,\
  \ for all the lessons learnt and the opportunities made available. Taiwan will forever\
  \ own a piece of my heart."
