Text: "After several weeks of 16 hour work days I drove past a billboard that said\
  \ \u201Chave you been to Istanbul?\u201D, I was tired and started to have a conversation\
  \ with myself as to why I had never been to Istanbul: It wasn\u2019t personal, I\
  \ just hadn\u2019t had the time, there are other places I would rather visit first,\
  \ I didn\u2019t speak the language. I caught myself arguing and forced myself to\
  \ focus on the class I was getting ready to teach. On the door to my office there\
  \ was a flyer \u201CHave you ever thought of visiting Istanbul?\u201D, well, as\
  \ a matter of fact I was just arguing with myself about that, I thought.\nExhausted\
  \ and realizing it had been over a year since my last vacation, I searched for tickets\
  \ to Istanbul, booked them and forgot about them. Three days before the trip, I\
  \ noticed several days blocked off in my calendar, after a little digging I realized\
  \ there was a trip to Istanbul I had booked that I completely forgot about in the\
  \ chaos of my life. I hadn\u2019t learned a word, didn\u2019t have a full itinerary,\
  \ I didn\u2019t even have hotels reserved. For someone who plans out their entire\
  \ vacations ahead of time, this trip was doomed. I hadn\u2019t fully considered\
  \ Istanbul, had no ideas as to what I wanted to get out of this trip and I couldn\u2019\
  t even build relationships with locals as I was that jerk that didn\u2019t even\
  \ bother to learn a few of the local words. The driver to the airport was Turkish\
  \ so I asked him to teach me a few words and on the flight I learned a few more\
  \ words and started to sketch out an itinerary. It turns out, I really didn\u2019\
  t want to go to Istanbul, so I made my way to Cappadocia.\nCappadocia was the most\
  \ magical and romantic place I had ever been. I remember opening my eyes early in\
  \ the morning as the bus was pulling in to Cappadocia, to see all these slow-moving\
  \ hot air balloons over a vast and arid land: If you are still carrying the stress\
  \ of work, anxiety over not getting anything done or not having plans, these balloons\
  \ serve as a cosmic instruction to just breathe. I got off the bus. I really was\
  \ tired, in a physical, emotional, spiritual way and I hadn\u2019t realized it until\
  \ those balloons asked me to breathe. My divorce was final; I had a wining battle,\
  \ losing war with an employer and my body was aching from long hours of work and\
  \ sleep deprivation. I had thoroughly internalized that everything I had was worthless,\
  \ and as I walked to my hotel, I saw a camel. That quickly Cappadocia started to\
  \ seduce me, the landscape was so special, I forgot how worthless I was. There were\
  \ tons of caves I could sneak in and out of, I marveled at the life people made\
  \ from a barren land. The place was so beautiful it re-connected me to my curiosity,\
  \ to the me who once saw life as an exploration and not as a place to commodify\
  \ your worth. \nIt didn\u2019t matter what I had to offer the world, what mattered\
  \ was what the world had to offer me, and at this moment, Cappadocia had a lot to\
  \ offer, great tea, friendly people, ancient religious art, caves as unique as each\
  \ one of its prior dwellers. Every morning I would wake up to breakfast and those\
  \ hot air balloons hovering over me, reminded me to breathe. Day by day I re-learned\
  \ how beautiful the world and each one of its details was, which by extension reminded\
  \ me that I was worthy of being here. I arrived in Cappadocia a shell of a person\
  \ unaware of her emptiness and left it overflowing with joy. \nI did make it to\
  \ Istanbul where I had a blast, but maybe all these years I hadn\u2019t thought\
  \ about going to Istanbul, because what I needed was a detour to Cappadocia and\
  \ a billboard to help me find it."
