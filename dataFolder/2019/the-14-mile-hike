Text: "I grew up in sunny and flat Florida, of course I\u2019ve been hiking a few\
  \ times, three times to be exact, a couple miles here and there but nothing compared\
  \ to what I faced when I went hiking in Zakopane, 14 miles. Poland was a special\
  \ country to me because of my family\u2019s background and history with the country.\
  \ My cousin, who is a experienced hiker and I went to go hike up to this beautiful\
  \ lake, Czarny Staw Gasienicowy. The hike started with views of flock of sheep grazing\
  \ along the rolling country side, the Polish locals would call this the lowland\
  \ country. Green everywhere, more greenery then I have ever seen in my life making\
  \ me excited and feeling like a child again wanting to run into the fields of grass\
  \ and wander. Going up we ran into a lot of the locals, it was beginning of May\
  \ when we went, a solid 60 degrees during the day and dropping below 55 at night,\
  \ not a lot of tourists yet coming, but they would be coming within the next couple\
  \ of weeks. The hike started easily enough, as we went higher I could see snow on\
  \ the mountain and right next to us, this was my first time seeing snow. The way\
  \ it contrasted against the greenery was almost magical. Since it was still early\
  \ in the season for hiking, there was a lot of snow of the trials. There was the\
  \ one long path, probably half a American football field, covered in snow, with\
  \ the mountain on one side and a straight 500 feet drop down on the other side.\
  \ When I first stepped onto the snow it was slick, almost ice like and I fell down.\
  \ In that moment I was afraid that I would slip and drop off the trail because I\
  \ was not familiar with snow or ice. I was shuffling my feet, thinking one thought\
  \ as I was crossing, the lake, how beautiful it would be and how fulfilling it would\
  \ feel that I could get past this snow to get there. It took some time of course\
  \ to cross the path but once I did it was a nice little hike to the lake. The first\
  \ glance at the lake took my breath away, the blues of the water were amazing. From\
  \ far away the water would reflect the mountains, but up close the water was a deep\
  \ sapphire blue in the middle but a turquoise blue by the shore. In my eyes the\
  \ perfect kind of water that I would free dive when I was in Florida, it was so\
  \ clear. There was a eerie kind of silence and peaceful feeling to the place, it\
  \ seemed like it wasn\u2019t a part of this world, so remote from the towering skyscrapers\
  \ and congested traffic. I felt a longing in that moment, almost as if my ancestors\
  \ were here at one point and at content with the world because I knew that places\
  \ untouched by mankind, like this place, were still around and I wanted to see and\
  \ explore."
