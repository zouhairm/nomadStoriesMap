Text: "I had a boyfriend who I travelled with and we had a very intense relationship,\
  \ we decided to break up after I decided to move to Australia to study my masters\
  \ degree. However, I must confess that my ex was still in my mind, and even if he\
  \ married a Brazilian (yes he did!) a few months after we broke up, I couldn't erase\
  \ him from. Eventually he divorced the Brazilian guy and started talking to me which\
  \ made me wonder what would happen if we would get back together. \nSo after a few\
  \ months of talking and making my new year's resolutions, I decided that I needed\
  \ to solve that situation, for either good or bad but just get it over with. I needed,\
  \ in a personal level, to see him and know whether this was going to continue or\
  \ not. So in that season while we were talking I bought my plane ticket and decided\
  \ to fly to Barcelona with him for a couple of months; to my surprise, a few weeks\
  \ before the actual flight, my ex stopped talking to me which made me wonder whether\
  \ this was still happening. \nOne week before the trip, he told me that he had a\
  \ new boyfriend and I couldn't stay at his place. Luckily I had a few friends that\
  \ lived in Barcelona that helped me out to get accommodation for a decent price.\
  \ But instead of spending all my holidays in Barcelona, I decided to travel a bit\
  \ and make the best out of it. \nI knew a guy that lived in Spain and he invited\
  \ me to go to Mykonos for a week, it sounded great, it was a place where I had never\
  \ been so I said yes. \nIn Mykonos, between the drinking and the partying, I met\
  \ a Mexican guy who became a really good travel buddy, better than  my other mate.\
  \ He told me that he was travelling as well around Europe and that we would be in\
  \ Barcelona at some stage, so we swapped numbers.\nBack in Barcelona, my ex kept\
  \ on texing me, calling me and insisting to meet, I never replied. One day, while\
  \ I was walking to my gym, I ran into him on the street. I couldn't believe it,\
  \ but after speaking a bit with him and having a cup of coffee I realized I wasn't\
  \ into him anymore (thank God!).  \nThat very weekend, my Mexican friend landed\
  \ in Barcelona, he told me he would be at his hostel at 11.30pm so I decided to\
  \ buy a bottle or rum and coke to have some drinks before heading out. To my luck,\
  \ his plane was delayed so I was there, outside of his hostel waiting for him to\
  \ arrive. When I was there by myself waiting, a cute Portuguese guy walked into\
  \ the hostel. We started speaking, he was drunk and his Spanish wasn't great, so\
  \ we spoke in English. Eventually my mate got to the hostel, we had a few more drinks\
  \ and headed out. Guilherme, the Portuguese guy didn't go out with us. \nThe next\
  \ morning, a friend from Australia messaged me and told me that he was going to\
  \ be in Barcelona for a few days, so we went walking to the Tibidabo, a mountain\
  \ with a church in Barcelona, it was great. On the way down Jorge, my Mexican friend\
  \ called me and told me that we should go to the beach, I told him to find the Portuguese\
  \ and bring him over. He did, we went all four of us to the beach, we went out that\
  \ night and eventually kissed Guilherme. After that night we didn't separate at\
  \ all. When we went back to Portugal, I went back with him for 10 days which was\
  \ amazing. I went back to Australia for a few months before moving back to Mexico,\
  \ but on the way back, I went and visited him in Lisbon. He was just here a couple\
  \ of weeks ago and I'm planning on going back to meet him over the summer. \nIt's\
  \ crazy how things happened. I went to see my ex and ended up having a new boyfriend."
