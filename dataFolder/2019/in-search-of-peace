Text: "I sat in the back of a small bus heading for the outskirts of town. Around\
  \ me were a smattering of people - all students, some study abroad kids fulfilling\
  \ stereotypes of volunteering in Africa, others full-time undergraduates participating\
  \ in extracurriculars. We were all heading to the same place: a school in one of\
  \ the townships outside of Cape Town to run an after-school program. My attention\
  \ was drawn to the girl next to me. She was petite and reserved, hunched over in\
  \ a way that suggested inferiority. A headscarf hung gracefully over her shoulders.\
  \ \n\nMy interest in Islam, specifically women\u2019s rights within the religion,\
  \ peaked a couple weeks earlier when I was introduced to the topic in a book on\
  \ the Iranian Revolution. Driven by curiosity, I did my best to meld religion into\
  \ basic small talk. I was surprised by her enthusiasm to my line of questioning.\
  \ Having grown-up in Post-9/11 America, her openness was refreshing. \n\nAs the\
  \ buildings began to give way to streets lined with aluminium shacks and coke-a-cola\
  \ signs, she started to tell me with quiet confidence about how her religion guides\
  \ her. Aqeelah, her name I later learned, said that the principles of Islam align\
  \ with being a good person. She described this feeling of peace unlike anything\
  \ I have ever imagined where your awareness rises above your being and you levitate\
  \ there suspended in this moment of simple existence. Yet, her decision to dedicate\
  \ more of her life to Islam came with many challenges both on an individual level,\
  \ to continue to hold strict principles, and on an interpersonal level, to reach\
  \ out to others, to help strangers, and to forgive. That feeling of peace is the\
  \ reward. \n\nWhat shocked me the most though was not the basis of principles or\
  \ the mastery of meditation, it was one simple definition. That the word Islam means\
  \ peace. In that moment helplessness and sadness weighed me down, withering my reserve\
  \ with the harshness that sometimes surrounds us. This religion that I have never\
  \ been properly introduced to and that has been ripped to shreds by the media because\
  \ of a small percentage of people, at its core is peace. She said \u201Cto conquer\
  \ peace is to conquer life.\u201D She believed that if we can do that then there\
  \ is no more envy or hate or wars over what god you believe in. This was in South\
  \ Africa, a country that much like the United States, has hate woven into the fabric\
  \ of society. Even the bus we were on is proof that inequalities exist on every\
  \ level. \n\nI looked out the window as the bus began to slow. We pulled into a\
  \ dusty courtyard perimetered by tan one-storied buildings. Aqeelah reached down\
  \ and removed a small ornately decorated book from her backpack and hesitantly handed\
  \ it to me. With a laugh she mentioned that I can have it, that she got it for free\
  \ from the Muslim Student Association on campus. Unsure but touched by the gesture,\
  \ I put the Quran in my bag and headed down the steps of the bus. \n\nWe were immediately\
  \ surrounded by kids in matching yellow polos and khaki bottoms. The topic for the\
  \ day was body image. I watched boys and girls with dark skin and shaved heads glue\
  \ pictures of middle-aged white men with large watches and women with long blonde\
  \ hair onto pages supposed to represent what they find beautiful. The same sadness\
  \ from before hit me anew. I realized that the world does not function as the smooth\
  \ sphere it presents but rather a mountain range where the summit is arbitrary and\
  \ the climbs are endless. The kids, oblivious to my distress, were content to laugh\
  \ at my inability to pronounce even a single word in Xhosa. The peace Aqeelah described\
  \ can come in many forms. Aqeelah found her footing within her faith and the kids,\
  \ still too young to grasp the depths of institutionalized racism, held it in simple\
  \ human connection. \u201CTo conquer peace is to conquer life\u201D."
