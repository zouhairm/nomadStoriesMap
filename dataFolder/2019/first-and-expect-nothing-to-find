Text: "I am always excited to see new places and faces. Just recently in 22nd of February\
  \ 2019. I received an info from my supervisor since I am the chairperson of the\
  \ Student Council on my university that I've been nominated to go to Yogyakarta\
  \ for 2 days for a job and being called by the national accreditation institution\
  \ for a observer training in there. At first I don't expect much except I will be\
  \ taking my day off from the university life and since it's Yogyakarta; one of the\
  \ best places to travel in Indonesia, then I thought why not? They bought me train\
  \ ticket to Yogyakarta in Tuesday, 26th of February at 7:00PM arriving in Yogyakarta\
  \ on the next day, 3:13AM and a ticket back to Jakarta at Thursday 28th of February\
  \ at 6:08PM arriving in Jakarta on the next day at 2:43AM.\n\nMy train ticket to\
  \ Yogyakarta  starts in the Pasar Senen Station near Jakarta, though I am staying\
  \ in Cikarang; which is quite far. I arrived on the Jatinegara transit train station\
  \ and waiting for the next train to Pasar Senen station as the clock shows 6:40PM.\
  \ The train haven't arrived yet so I took an online ojek (like an Uber; it is not\
  \ a car but a motorcycle) and guessing that I might come late and have been changing\
  \ drivers and drove fast yet I lost my train. Then I ordered another ticket using\
  \ my own money, though they are all that I've got. Got myself a train ticket straight\
  \ to Yogyakarta station, near Malioboro departured at 9:45PM. Although my heart\
  \ was pounding like real fast, this was my first time on a long distance train,\
  \ so it was quite of a ride. \n\nArrived in Yogyakarta early in the morning at 6AM\
  \ then having a lot of spare times on backpacking around Yogyakarta until the event\
  \ starts at 12AM. Walked 2 kilometers to the nearest Mc. Donald to work on my journal\
  \ and book reviews and (I am still attached to the mid examination) finished my\
  \ breakfast, and having less time of sleep at 10AM. Yogyakarta was beautifully slicing\
  \ hot that day but I decided to walk to the 5 stars hotel as the venue for the event.\
  \ Supposedly it only took around 1 hours of walking to the venue with the total\
  \ of 6.5 kilometers of walking but I decided to take a detour into the heart of\
  \ Yogyakarta, among the rural areas of Yogyakarta. Running a bit late it was 11:30AM\
  \ about halfway to the venue then I took an online ojek and arrived at 12AM to the\
  \ venue. Settled up, meeting some peoples there and go to the hotel room. I met\
  \ with this guy named Rais, short and brownish skin man and on the same age as me;\
  \ he was my roommate. A little introduction was happening there as we waited for\
  \ the first agenda at 2PM. The agenda then finished and it was 10PM then the others\
  \ agreed to gathered on me and Rais room to play, discuss about politics and decide\
  \ on which part of Yogyakarta should've traveled in the morning on the next day.\
  \ We talked until 3AM in the morning then we slept as we agreed on playing with\
  \ the sunrise at 6AM; fun fact is that we woke up at 8AM.\n\n28th of February then\
  \ we backpacking to Yogyakarta and I don't expect anything like this. We went to\
  \ the fort, temporary exhibition and everything was 50 percent planned and the rest\
  \ was not. After all of the thing that I didn't expect, there's always something\
  \ that Yogyakarta wanted to tell me, there's always something about it yet I don't\
  \ even know until now and that something about Yogyakarta is the thing that I am\
  \ planning to save up my money to go to Yogyakarta once again somewhere around in\
  \ the next two months and just backpacking by myself. I made friends and expect\
  \ the unexpected in Yogyakarta as the first timer. Then on the next day while expecting\
  \ nothing. I came across this writing scholarship and I didn't expect what to find\
  \ in Portugal. Until then, will be seeing Portugal on the next paper."
