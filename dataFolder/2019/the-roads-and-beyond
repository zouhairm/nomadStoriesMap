Text: I'm from the Northeast India.. It was on October 2018 we planned on to visit
  my granny who lives in a place called Seppa in the same state as mine. We took the
  newly carved out road and had no idea about it. Singing and laughing we raced through
  the virgin forest. Crossed thousands of cascading waterfalls and jubilant streams.
  Fell off my seat on the bumpy roads but uttered not a single word. We crossed mountains
  and roads of thousand loops. My camera was out every time I heard birds singing
  in the deep deep forest. My diary was full by the time I reached my destination
  making every note as to what I had seen. We were above the clouds speeding at 120..
  it was nothing but fog all around. On continuing we found out a small hotel kind
  of where we halted for a while to dip a cup of hot tea. I can't tell in words how
  important tea felt then. Elders had beer to beat the odds maybe! We crossed many
  villages that was unknown to me with paddy fields around that could feed up a whole
  town for a year. I felt the chills deep in my bones as it was warmer in other places.
  We continued with the beautiful journey.. a journey of red car in the white fog
  speeding through the clouds! This was Arunachal. A small unexplored gateway till
  we discovered it!
