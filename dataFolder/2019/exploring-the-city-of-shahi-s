Text: "Officially coined as Vijayapura, locals still call it Bijapur and this town\
  \ of Adil Shahis flaunt the rich culture and heritage with its great monuments.\
  \ The rich architectural marvel of Gol Gumbaz sings the glorious rule of Adil Shahis\
  \ as it takes you to the bygone era of the Deccan rulers.\nThe Gol Gumbaz here is\
  \ a jewel in the crown and that is certainly not an exaggeration at all, after my\
  \ visit to this place, I realized that this monument takes you to a different world\
  \ freeing you from all the manacles.\nMy journey to Gol Gumbaz started from Bagalkot;\
  \ I took a bus to Bijapur at 9 AM in the morning and straight from the land of Chalukyas,\
  \ I was transported to the land of Adil Shahis in about a couple of hours. The amazing\
  \ architecture of Taj Mahal kept enduring my mind when I was going towards this\
  \ gigantic monument.\nThe distance between Bagalkot to Bijapur is approximately\
  \ 84 km. The roads are well-maintained hence; there wasn\u2019t any delay in reaching\
  \ Bijapur from Bagalkot.\_ There are local trains available as well to commute from\
  \ Bagalkot to Bijapur but I chose to take a bus because that\u2019s how I like to\
  \ travel.\nGetting down at the Bijapur bus-stand and catching an auto is a most\
  \ challenging thing. There is no meter system hence; the prices are sky-high for\
  \ visitors. Looks like I was lucky enough to find an unpretentious one. His name\
  \ was Basheer; he charged me forty bucks and dropped me at the Gol Gumbaz.\nThe\
  \ dome smiled at me as I stood and raised my head admiring every inch of that gargantuan\
  \ structure. After dumping my bags in the luggage room, I started walking towards\
  \ the massive Gol Gumbaz spread across a large area.\nThere are beautiful lawns\
  \ on either side of the monument with some ruins, which once served as workers quarters.\n\
  I kept looking up as I walked inside the sprawling beauty, the dome was going down,\
  \ I ran back and the dome came up again, it was an amazing spectacle and as I went\
  \ ahead, I realized that the actual dome was concealed carefully behind the two\
  \ other buildings.\nThe first building is known as the Nazar Khaana which is now\
  \ a museum and this building was constructed by the Adil Shahis to keep the Gumbaz\
  \ safe from the enemy attacks. As you walk further ahead, you would see the arches\
  \ which create an optical illusion.\n\n\nYou would feel that all the arches are\
  \ of the same size but only when you walk closer to the building would you know\
  \ the difference and this is just astounding.\nAdjacent to the magnificent building\
  \ is a mosque within the premises and there are\_three other mosques that surround\
  \ this colossal beauty. This is the second largest dome in the world and you can\
  \ view the entire city of Bijapur from the 7th floor of this mausoleum.\nSince it\
  \ was built by the 7th Adil Shah, Gol Gumbaz has seven floors and it was built by\
  \ the king Mohammed Adil Shah and the architect was Yaqut of Dabul. There have been\
  \ no records of the expenses that have been incurred in building this amazing structure,\
  \ however; it has taken 30 long years to complete this wondrous memorial.\n\n\n\
  The architecture of the dome is laudable; it displays the great skills of the craftsmen\
  \ of those times. The whispering gallery shows the heights of architectural brilliance\
  \ of this place. It is sad to see it getting abused by the visitors screaming their\
  \ lungs off in madness. The whispering gallery will soon lose its charm and it is\
  \ certainly unfortunate to see a glorious memorial like this being exploited by\
  \ the tourists.\nInside the whispering gallery, you can actually hear your own heartbeats\
  \ if there is complete silence. The best time to visit the whispering gallery is\
  \ 6 AM in the morning as there would be no visitors during that time. The monument\
  \ is opened between 6 AM to 6 PM hence; you can choose to visit it during the early\
  \ mornings.\nIt looks like the acoustic system of modern days is copied from the\
  \ concept of Gol Gumbaz. The whole area of the whispering gallery works like a telephone.\
  \ There are eight windows placed systematically which acts as a CCTV. Anybody who\
  \ enters the building can be caught through these windows from the whispering gallery\
  \ and that is really a brilliant architecture.\nThere is a line marked on the ground\
  \ when you are speaking to someone else on the opposite end, you should not be crossing\
  \ that line in order to your voice is heard by the opposite person. The technology\
  \ and the logic used inside the monument are beyond words.\nThe intricate designs\
  \ on the walls showcase the rich heritage of Deccan architecture, there are a lot\
  \ of floral patterned motifs carved on the walls of the monument along with the\
  \ minarets.\nThe best experience one could probably have while in Gol Gumbaz is\
  \ when you are on the seventh floor of the monument. You would certainly feel like\
  \ you are in seventh heaven. With the bird\u2019s eye view of the Bijapur city and\
  \ the melody of the gushing wind traveling through every cell of your body would\
  \ leave you charmed. \nI spent about a couple of hours enjoying the divine waft\
  \ at this beautiful Gol Gumbaz. I finished my lunch at the canteen within the premises.\
  \ They serve you the best Biriyani rice along with gravy and some hot onion bhajiyas.\
  \ Of course, I made friends with the canteen owner and his name is Asif (Asif Bhayya).\
  \ Well, I should not forget the crispy Papdi he packed for free for my onward journey.\n\
  As I bid goodbye to my new friends and the exquisite monument, I let the culture\
  \ of the city jibe in me; I looked back again to steal one last glimpse of that\
  \ ecstatic charm before I started back to another place."
