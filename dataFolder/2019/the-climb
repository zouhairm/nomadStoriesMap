Text: "It was 1am, and Amber (my girlfriend and travel companion) had, uncharacteristically,\
  \ managed to respond to the barking alarm we'd set in anticipation of a twilight\
  \ mountain climbing excursion. The driver was outside our hotel. He greeted us with\
  \ bright-eyed enthusiasm, opening the rear door of his vehicle for his half befuddled,\
  \ heavy eyed passengers. Within minutes of setting off, Amber, despite her earnest\
  \ attempts to remain more conscious than unconscious, had incrementally stooped\
  \ onto my lap with eyes which had closed through no volition of her own, as we meandered\
  \ through roads which seemed to guarantee a crash at every turn. Nonetheless, the\
  \ driver continued to engage us in sprightly conversation (whilst sustaining eye\
  \ contact with me in his rear mirror, which terrified me) telling us about his wife\
  \ and three children. The car came to a steady halt at what was ostensibly a well\
  \ populated shack in the middle of a long empty road. We disembarked and were welcomed\
  \ with fresh Indonesian coffee and fried bananas, presented to us by an elderly\
  \ couple who spoke with smiles and genteel nods. Before Amber and I had finished\
  \ our (delicious) coffee and (not so delicious) fried bananas, more vehicles began\
  \ to cautiously approach the shack, depositing similarly stupefied tourists. Two\
  \ Italian women and a German family approached the shack and sat beside us. They\
  \ spoke in fluent English, inducing that familiar sense of guilt at our typically\
  \ British attitude of insouciance towards language learning. We were soon politely\
  \ ushered back into the cars in which we had came and were taken to the base of\
  \ Mount Batur, where we were handed a bottle of water, a torch and a word of warning\
  \ regarding the climb ahead. It was in this moment that Amber and I seemed to share\
  \ a moment of trepidation. Had we bitten off more than we could chew? Our mountain\
  \ climbing experience was minimal. I had managed one climb of Snowden, on the most\
  \ congenial route Mount Snowden has to offer, and Amber claimed to have conquered\
  \ Mount Snowden once before, only to later confess that on that occasion she had\
  \ taken the train to the summit.  We began the ascent. The night was warm and clear,\
  \ and the sky was littered with winking stars. I crooked my head, and stared into\
  \ the cosmos with satisfying curiosity, as the guide informed us that we had been\
  \ gifted the perfect night for the twilight mountain climb and assured us that we\u2019\
  d get to see the sunrise on a most clear morning. We marched northwards. The ground\
  \ was gravelly and slipped away at the point of compression from our feet. Amber,\
  \ I and one of the guides soon realised we had separated from the rest of the group,\
  \  climbing and panting for what felt like several hours. I tentatively, with strained\
  \ hope, asked the guide for his estimation of how far was left (it was the darkest\
  \ of nights, and, to us, the mountain was yet reveal itself). We were half way.\
  \ The air had begun to touch us with a chilling coldness, at which point I realised\
  \ that my infinitesimal, inadequate brain had failed to account for the altitude\
  \ when getting dressed that morning (I was wearing shorts and t-shirt and would\
  \ later that day develop a cold). Finally, we reached the summit, where we were\
  \ offered more fried bananas, a blanket, hot chocolate and lead to seat facing away\
  \ from the mountain gazing at where we were told the sun would present itself. Amber\
  \ and I sat side by side, me soaked in sweat, and Amber looking as composed as ever,\
  \ with a shared sense of achievement. The great sun began to rise. It soon looked\
  \ down on us radiating a welcomed warmth. Amber, myself and the many other tourists\
  \ who had successfully scaled the mountain (the remainder of our group were nowhere\
  \ to be seen) sat in silence, bewitched by the beauty of the rising sun, when a\
  \ thick fog rolled over the hills, completely taking the sun from sight. Sods law.\
  \ Nonetheless, we sat and savoured the sense of satisfaction at having conquered\
  \ the formidable climb and experienced something which felt adventurous and new."
