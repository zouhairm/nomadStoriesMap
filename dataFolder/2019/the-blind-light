Text: "It was 7 pm and I was on my way to New York City.  All I could see through\
  \ the dirty bus window was a blurred shape of the Statue of Liberty and thousands\
  \ of tiny lights. Right from the Greyhound bus station, I was destined for Time\
  \ Square. Little by little, my eyes were getting used to the diversity of colors\
  \ and people. For a minute, I imagined I was witness to the building of a new Tower\
  \ of Babylon: thousands of people speaking different languages roaming the streets.\
  \ I squeezed my eyes shut. I could not define what was brighter \u2013 the endless\
  \ illuminations, the flashes of cameras or people\u2019s smiles.\nI met my friends\
  \ and we took a subway to get to our hostel.  After 20 minutes, I started to fall\
  \ asleep.\n \u201CHow old are you?\u201D a deep low voice returned me to reality.\
  \ I turned my head towards the sound and saw a man sitting next to me, in his fifties\
  \ wearing grubby old clothes with a bandage covering his eye. He was looking at\
  \ me with genuine curiosity.\n\u201C23\u201D\n\u201CIt cannot be true. You look\
  \ so young. I thought you were a teenager\u201D his infectious laugh filled the\
  \ carriage attracting the passengers\u2019 attention.\n\u201CThat must be because\
  \ of my gaudy woolen scarf\u201D was the thought that immediately crossed my mind\
  \ and I recalled how I was stopped a couple of days ago wearing the very same scarf\
  \ by a complete stranger who turned out to be an artist.  \u201CYou look like art.\
  \ Can I take a photo of you?\u201D she asked enthusiastically.  \nI can safely say\
  \ that the most delightful conversations have happened to me when they were least\
  \ expected.\n\u201CYou can\u2019t love anyone if you love your freedom more,\u201D\
  \ a smile appeared on his face.\n\u201CBut partners can be equal\u201D I protested\
  \ stubbornly.\nHe gave me a look, which adults give when they hear childish thoughts.\n\
  \u201CMy wife left me and took my children. I don\u2019t think I will ever see them\
  \ again,\u201D he said wistfully. \nI was so absorbed in our conversation that I\
  \ hadn\u2019t noticed the whole carriage, including my friends had been listening\
  \ with undisguised surprise.\n\u201CIt is time to go\u201D a friend of mine interrupted\
  \ our conversation.\n\u201CThank you so much\u201D I waved farewell leaving the\
  \ carriage.\nAfter a while, I noticed my subway friend behind us.\n\u201CWhere are\
  \ you going?\u201D he asked, catching up.\n\u201CWe need to find our hostel\u201D\
  \ showing him the address.\n\u201CI know where it is\u201D he gave us a big smile.\
  \  \n\u201CIs he coming with us?\u201D I saw the first traces of worry on my friends\u2019\
  \ faces.\n\u201CEverything is going to be fine\u201D I tried to allay their fears.\n\
  \u201CWhere do you live?\u201D I inquired hoping to lessen the tension.\n\"Nowhere.\
  \ The rent was too high so I couldn\u2019t afford it. But it is ok\u201D he tried\
  \ to sound optimistic.\n\u201CWhat are you doing here in New York?\u201D \n\u201C\
  I came here from Mexico many years ago to start a new life. I had big dreams but\
  \ then fell ill and lost all my savings,\u201D he explained.\n\u201CWhy are you\
  \ helping us?\u201D that was the last question.\n\u201CBecause a lot of people helped\
  \ me too\u201D he said, looking me in the eyes.\nIt was a dark cold silent night\
  \ and we had been walking for more than fifteen minutes when my friends finally\
  \ begged: \u201CLet\u2019s take a taxi, please. We are cold and tired\u201D.\nMy\
  \ subway friend opened the cab door.\n\u201CThank you so much for everything\u201D\
  \ I was so sad I could hardly smile.\n\u201CTake care of yourself, little one!\u201D\
  \ He had the most tender look I\u2019d ever seen in my life.\n\u201CI thought he\
  \ would ask for money\u201D.\n\u201CHe just wanted to help\u201D I replied quickly\
  \ looking at his disappearing silhouette.  \nThat night proved again the biggest\
  \ paradox of life: \u201CSomeone who has everything gives nothing; someone who has\
  \ nothing gives everything\u201D.\nI know no matter how many years pass whenever\
  \ I close my eyes I will always see my kind blind light."
