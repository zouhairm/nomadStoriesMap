Text: "It was for the first time when I went on a college trip with my friends. I\
  \ was really excited. It was a one week trip to Himachal pradesh and Amritsar (the\
  \ north region of India) . I had this huge love for mountains in my heart, and I\
  \ don't know where it came from because this was the first time i was going to see\
  \ large mountains and those curvy dangerous roads.\nIt was really hard to hold excitment\
  \ for on the way. I had my preset mind that travelling brings speed to life. It\
  \ brings joy ,fun ,knwledge and excitment.  We danced , sung bollywood songs and\
  \ cheered really hard to the trip all along the way in train. The moment roads started\
  \ taking curves , the songs and sounds stopped. It took 4 long hours in a mini bus\
  \ from amritsar to himachal . The turns of roads took all our Meals out , each of\
  \ us had vomit sessions. Felt like were being detoxicated by the fresh air of mountains.\
  \ Like they were cleaning us before we enter. Finally when we arrived and I stepped\
  \ down from my bus, i was speechless. I had no words, there was excitment only a\
  \ constant smile. All of sudden i felt content . I dont know why, the feeling wasnt\
  \ bad but also not happy, it was not bitter but also not sweet . I was in tears.\
  \ Seeing those huge huge mountains, they were kind . The time stood still, it felt\
  \ like everything was PAUSED . No hustle , no hurry , no tasks to be completed .\
  \ Stand still and pour in the beauty of large snow capped mountains. Long tall spiky\
  \ trees , frozen seeds, chilling winds. It was everything yet nothing. The next\
  \ 4 days in mountains we did trrekking, camping, bon fire, dancing . We went to\
  \ the local mountains , the people were so kind and hardwroking , the lives of those\
  \ people was actually tough.  We purchased woolens and some cute handicrafts from\
  \ the local shops.  Then another big moment came.  Our tour guide planned a para\
  \ gliding session for us.  That was an oh my god moment.  We were taken uphill to\
  \ and then all tied up with parachutes  then given instructions and it the moment\
  \ when I was in air.  I am not able to find words but I was seeing those huge mountains\
  \ swinging in sky.  Itnwas an irreplaceable time.  I forget everything for those\
  \ 5 to 10 mins.  I was enjoying my existence  swinging in the air.  I was only smiling\
  \ no pains no grudges.  I felt like a free bird.  The frozen canopy and sharps peaks\
  \ of the hills, everything asked me to keep calm,  breathe deep and live the moment.\
  \  Leaving mountains were so painful but we had to leave.  I could each hill going\
  \ blur as moved down the road. This was my travel story.  That left me with lots\
  \ of emotional feelings and no words.  \nAnd taught me to PAUSE and breathe so that\
  \ u can feel your existence."
