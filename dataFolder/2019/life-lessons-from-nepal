Text: "\u201CI could climb the Himalayan Mountains\u2026 I could travel back in time\
  \ and hear Al Green sing/ It wouldn\u2019t mean a thing without you\u201D, croons\
  \ Bruno Major soulfully in the sentimental opener of his album A Song for Every\
  \ Moon. So goes the resonating soundtrack for my visit to Nepal last November, freshly\
  \ broken-hearted, earnestly seeking solace 4130 metres above sea level at Annapurna\
  \ Base Camp (ABC). \n\nEmbittered by my recent visa denial after a trying year in\
  \ New York City, I seized every excuse to not be stuck moping in Singapore\u2014\
  Indonesia, Myanmar, Japan\u2026 Nepal. Some travel to discover; others to soul-search;\
  \ yet others, to escape. This Himalayan trip definitely qualified as the lattermost.\
  \ \n\nThose nine days of trudging, scrambling, and panting up and down the rugged\
  \ terrain were enormously physically taxing, but excellent for rejuvenating my mind.\
  \ In the mountains, technology is sparse if existent. Time slows without accessibility\
  \ to an incessant barrage of social media and emails\u2014 communication is pared\
  \ to the humans before you. This purge from devices, along with the sublime views\
  \ from higher ground\u2014chilly sunrise hikes and mild altitude sickness notwithstanding\u2014\
  \ helped soothe my jumbled mind. The duration of post-hike descent spent in Nepal\u2019\
  s capital city Kathmandu however, was equally impressionable. \n\nPost ABC flu-bug\
  \ in full force\u2014that week largely comprised pairing Strepsils strips with copious\
  \ steaming mugs of ginger honey-lemon water (the magical temporary remedy!). My\
  \ \u2018home\u2019 for the week was Jhamsikhel, the locally recognized Expatriate\
  \ district, generously set up by an old college friend who now lives and works in\
  \ Kathmandu. Through her, I met a tight-knit and extremely inclusive international\
  \ community of artists, who essentially made my Kathmandu experience. \n\nHuman\
  \ connection is less about familiarity than wave length frequencies: if you vibe,\
  \ they\u2019re your tribe. Real talk about life, love, music, and the not so distant\
  \ future with my newfound friends was refreshing and relatively effortless, as was\
  \ hanging out together. \n \nTraveller-me always aims for the least diluted \u2018\
  local\u2019 experience\u2014roughing it out, struggling to communicate, getting\
  \ incredibly lost\u2026 Having local friends opened a gateway for a more authentic\
  \ taste of the scene: from chilling over coffee at a local joint, to gleefully haggling\u2014\
  teaching me how to, too\u2014 over cab fare. I even managed to mail a postcard at\
  \ the local post office with the (grudging) help of one of them. \u201CDon\u2019\
  t speak a word,\u201D she said sternly, \u201Cor they\u2019ll know you\u2019re foreign\
  \ and overcharge you\u201D. I look back fondly on that afternoon spent between the\
  \ precincts of Jhamsikhel and Patan, securely face-masked and riding pillion on\
  \ this Nepalese lady friend\u2019s scooter bike\u2014a staple mode of travel in\
  \ Kathmandu\u2019s terrifyingly chaotic traffic. Terrifying to one from a first\
  \ world nation, where strategically allocated pedestrian lights and crossings mostly\
  \ function as intended. \n\nBy the end of the week\u2014three-hour solo trek to\
  \ the infamous Bodha Stupa* included\u2014 I was coolly crossing extremely busy\
  \ two-way-streets like a Nepali... who dat badass? It had been a good minute since\
  \ I\u2019d encountered such densely overlapping pedestrian and vehicle traffic,\
  \ characteristic of many developing states in Asia. Conversely, Nepal\u2019s level\
  \ of pollution is saddening\u2014both burning of waste in the Himalayas and the\
  \ filth of the streets in Kathmandu. The country possesses natural beauty in awe-inspiring\
  \ abundance, but like many developing nations, caring for the environment is not\
  \ quite prioritised where people are engrossed in daily survival. \n\nWhen visiting\
  \ local \u2018squares\u2019 or areas that shops and people\u2014both visitors and\
  \ natives\u2014congregate in, the deep, dusty state of 2015 post-quake ruin that\
  \ Nepal faces was still apparent. Building debris, brick stacks and cement mix are\
  \ prevalent, many of the city\u2019s monument structures garbed in scaffolding,\
  \ the reparative process of restoration yet incomplete. \n\n\u201CSuitcases were\
  \ falling off the room shelves, my mother was screaming in the other room\u2026\
  \ it scared me that she was scared\u201D, admitted one Nepalese friend; yet another\
  \ recalling haltingly \u201CMy grandfather was injured by toppling ornaments, the\
  \ house I grew up in\u2014that [my family\u2019s] lived in since forever\u2014all\
  \ of it gone.\u201D Natural disasters hit trailing third world nations volumes harder,\
  \ and this devastation hits closer to home when you personally know those affected.\
  \ Even for me, as an outsider, newly connected."
