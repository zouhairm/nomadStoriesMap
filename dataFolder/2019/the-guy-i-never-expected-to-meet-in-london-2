Text: "My name is Rae and I am 32 years old solo traveler from Indonesia. I have traveled\
  \ to 23 countries, mostly by myself. Many people ask me why I always travel. I just\
  \ tell them I want to see the world.\n\nJanuary 21, 2018, I went to the UK for the\
  \ first time in my life. I landed in London Heathrow Airport at night in cold weather.\
  \ When I arrived at the airport, I bought a sim card and a transportation card,\
  \ called Osyter.\n\nI took the Underground to the King's Cross Station. I walked\
  \ and dragged my luggage to the hostel by using GPS. \n\nI woke up early to check\
  \ whether I could see the Warner Bros Studio. But they said they did not sell ticket\
  \ on the spot. Next time if you want to come to this place, please book the ticket\
  \ in advance!\n\nIt was a rainy day in London. I decided to see the Natural History\
  \ Museum. It was a great museum with a skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the\
  \ ceiling. The architecture of the building was even magnificent. Then I went to\
  \ the British Museum which was also great. I could spend the whole day in the museums.\
  \ \n\nThe next day, I spent my whole day in Warner Bros Studio where Harry Potter\
  \ movie was filmed. I saw all the authentic sets, discovered the magic behind the\
  \ spellbiding special effects and found out the behind-the-scenes secrets of the\
  \ movie. If you love Harry Potter, you must go this place!\n\nAt night, I met a\
  \ British guy whom I met from Tinder. I did not expect to meet a very kind, polite\
  \ and smart guy in London. He treated my Spanish dinner and we talked about a lot\
  \ of things. After that, we said goodbye and he ordered me a Mercedes Benz uber\
  \ which took me back to the hostel. I thought I was dreaming.\n\nThe next day, I\
  \ went to Edinburgh by National Express bus from London's Victoria bus station and\
  \ arriving at Edinburgh bus station. Traveling from London to Edinburgh by bus takes\
  \ around 9 hours and 30 minutes. I have booked the ticket in advance online.\n\n\
  When I arrived in Edinburgh, I checked in to a nice hostel across the Edinburgh\
  \ Palace. Because I could not do early check in, after leaving my luggage in the\
  \ luggage room, I went straight to the Palace. The palace was huge and beautiful.\
  \ I could see Edinburgh from the top!\n\nThe next day, I joined a free bus tour\
  \ to Stirling and Highlands. The tour guide took us to the Forth Bridge, National\
  \ Wallace Monument, Loch Katrine and Doune Castle. The tour was ended with a visit\
  \ to a farm of cute and hairy Highland cattles. It was a really nice and worthy\
  \ tour!\n\nAfter arrived in Edinburgh, I headed back to London by midnight bus.\
  \ It was a really tiring, exhausting trip. But I could sleep very well in the bus.\n\
  \nWhen I arrived in London, I stayed at a hostel located near the Elephant and Castle\
  \ train station. \n\nAfter seeing the Changing Guards at the Buckingham Palace,\
  \ I went to see the British guy again to give him a gift from Scotland. He took\
  \ me around his office to sightsee some buildings near the St. Paul Cathedral. After\
  \ a quick tour, he grabbed his lunch and said goodbye. I walked alone on Millenium\
  \ Bridge and started daydreaming. I think I fell in love in London and I really\
  \ want to stay in London someday.\n\nI went to see Oxford in the next morning by\
  \ taking train from the Paddington Station. Oxford is a nice place with nice museums\
  \ and libraries. Several scenes from the Harry Potter were shot here, including\
  \ the Oxford University\u2019s Bodleian Library. \n\nI went back to London by train\
  \ and was in rush to catch my flight back to Indonesia at night. \n\nI checked out\
  \ of the hostel and went to the Heathrow airport. He said goodbye and safe travels\
  \ to me. After boarding in the flight, I became very sad. I think I have left my\
  \ heart in London and I should be back.."
