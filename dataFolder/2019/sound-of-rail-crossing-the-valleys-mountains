Text: Ooty, the short form of ootacamund, the place which has been established by
  the english. Tea estates are the main attraction.. but there are lot more fruits
  which has been cultivating in & around Ooty valleys.. the beautiful valleys, mountains,
  forest, lakes, gardens etc will be a treat for our eyes. But I am behind the locals,
  their life in this cool place by doing cultivation, small scale industries, tourism
  etc.. my intention was to go through the rural areas to find out the pure Ooty culture..  to
  get to know how people r living in this terrain.. how the next generation is looking
  for their future.. years ago British India has established mountain railway line
  to Ooty to relax & refresh in Ooty as well as transportation of tea & other spices..
  this mountain railway has so much to speak abt a culture, about the earlier trading,
  import & exports.. eucalyptus is one of the main attraction in this area & it smells
  gud.. the building infrastructures here in ooty is same as old British pattern..
  the transformation of the place from British people to Ooty local people is quite
  interesting & I am searching for more interesting facts & stories on that..
