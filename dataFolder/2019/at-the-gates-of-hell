Text: "Walking into the world's first and only Buddhist theme park in Vietnam was\
  \ an eye-opening experience filled with entertainment vibrancy, religious artefacts,\
  \ and confusing concepts. With a mountainous water park set in the mouth of a King\
  \ Neptune, a colourful dragon statue marking the entrance, and even a seemingly\
  \ unlicensed Harry Potter themed haunted house ride, this theme park was like no\
  \ other place on Earth.\n\nDespite the park in its entirety being something I didn't\
  \ expect to find an hour outside of Ho Chi Minh City, the mystery continued to deepen\
  \ as I approached the \"Unicorn Palace\" - a building shaped like a colourful unicorn\
  \ situated at the back of the Suoi Tien park. In a strange world filled with roller\
  \ coasters and fruit themed parades, approaching the building that was made to resemble\
  \ a sweet creature of mythology filled my mind with images of cotton candy pink\
  \ clouds and sparkly horns. \n\nWhat I didn't expect to find inside the Unicorn\
  \ Palace was a depiction of the seven levels of Hell in the Buddhist religion.\n\
  \nTerrified Vietnamese tourists grabbed on to my arm as I descended down the darkened\
  \ stairway, further confusing me with the fact that they did not want to proceed\
  \ into this unicorn - shaped palace alone. We were greeted in screaming Vietnamese\
  \ and suddenly privy to depictions of mannequins being sawn in half, boiled in cauldrons,\
  \ and leaping out at us from coffins in their graves. Dark robed figures threatened\
  \ these terrified mannequins with cage after cage of torturous details, the darkness\
  \ of the rooms seeping into my bones as I wondered through the Unicorn Palace with\
  \ two strange women squeezing my arm in fright.\n\nFinally, at the last gruesome\
  \ scene of death, I reached the final door of the Unicorn Palace and broke out into\
  \ the blaring sunlight and heat of Vietnam. The two terrified tourists let go of\
  \ my arm with an embarrassed thanks and walked off into the rest of the park while\
  \ I stood there stunned.\n\nWhat had just happened? My soul was uneasy, and that\
  \ is not what you expect to feel or to find in a place shaped like a colourful unicorn.\
  \ Did I just find the gates of Hell that demons use to access the world? It felt\
  \ surreal, and dark, and dirty.\n\nI wondered into the rest of the park myself,\
  \ scratching my head in confusion. I had no idea what I had just witnessed and felt\
  \ extremely uneasy about the whole thing. Forget darkened alleys and war zones,\
  \ the Unicorn Palace of Suoi Tien is the most terrifying place in this whole world,\
  \ because it is not of this world.\n\nUnicorns are not to be trusted, and I have\
  \ been to Hell and back with the proof."
