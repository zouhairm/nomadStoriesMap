Text: "This is the second time I visit Mozambique. The first time was in a Regional\
  \ Geography class with a Mozambican guest. He made everyone in the classroom travel\
  \ in time and space with his stories, to be there, beyond the sea.\nI was in this\
  \ imaginary geography with an 8 year old who carried me through the rainforest fleeing\
  \ rebels and revolutionaries from a country invented by the settlers. Several days,\
  \ on foot. Russian weapons, leaders with strong persuasive power, lost people. I\
  \ thought of the fear he might have felt. Might.\nThe second time I went to Mozambique\
  \ was one of these days, here in Croatia. I met a Portuguese couple who intend to\
  \ travel the world, with their light spirits and enlightened souls. They lived in\
  \ Mozambique for two years, working with the editing and production of documentaries,\
  \ at the famous Kuxa Kanema in Maputo. \nTheir stories from this country are as\
  \ incredible as they are. The glances at the situations, the lenses of their cameras,\
  \ the carefully chosen words to recount the story transported me back to Africa.\n\
  And that made me realize people carry places within themselves. Many. Some collect\
  \ them. Others are more selective. But we always have places visited by our bodies\
  \ in our minds. And we make other people visit with their minds these places too.\
  \ Imaginary replicas of a reality that perhaps exists. Perhaps.\nI wonder if to\
  \ discover the legitimacy of these places it is necessary to be there, in body.\
  \ Wherever. And in this eagerness to think so I collect places.\nI gradually discover\
  \ that this is a paradox. The more places I visit, the more I recognize that there\
  \ are so many more to be visited. I know people on the road who tell me about others\
  \ and so many others. That maybe they exist. Maybe.\nOnce last year I met a hippie\
  \ in Brazil who gave me a message written on paper. \"Far is a place that does not\
  \ exist.\" Certainly it does not exist there far, but here in me there are so many.\
  \ Without maybe. But a hundred maybes."
