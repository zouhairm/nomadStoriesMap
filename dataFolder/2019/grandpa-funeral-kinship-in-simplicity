Text: "Grandpa Funeral \nKinship in simplicity.\n\nAfter 2 hours of flight and 7 hours\
  \ of driving, I finally arrived at the crossroad of my Father\u2019s village, Porsea.\
  \ I still needed to walk uphill around 5 minutes before arriving at my Grandma\u2019\
  s house.\n\nFamilies and relatives had been gathered around at my grandma\u2019\
  s yard accompanied by traditional music. Some of them smoked cigarettes, some of\
  \ them had a serious talking about the funeral execution. An extensive blue tent\
  \ had been established to cover the mourners from sunbeam and rain. This was because\
  \ the ceremonial process would be held for 3 days before buried.\n\nEntering my\
  \ wooden grandma\u2019s house, I saw my grandpa\u2019s body on the bed placed in\
  \ the living room. His body was cold and white. He wore the best cloth he had, together\
  \ with some stuffs that belonged to him, like glasses and bible. I sat for a moment\
  \ near to my Grandpa\u2019s body. Looked at him for the last time, prayed for him,\
  \ thanked him for sweet memories I had with him. \n\nSome old women walked back\
  \ and forth, chewed some betel leaves while they were tidying up their sarong. It\
  \ was told that wearing sarong makes a woman become well-mannered since no chair\
  \ or table that you would find in my grandma\u2019s house. People who come to visit\
  \ should manage their sitting position. It was pretty hard to sit on the wooden\
  \ floor politely, while other people (someone that you should really respect in\
  \ custom) might be in front of you.\n\nOutside of my grandma\u2019s traditional\
  \ house, mourners sang and danced tor-tor, the Bataknese traditional dance, enthusiastically.\
  \ They wore ulos in the dark colour on their right shoulder, mostly black since\
  \ black is the colour of grief. \n\n\u201CWhy do they dance in a grief?\u201D I\
  \ whispered to my uncle curiously.\n\n\u201CBecause they believe that this is the\
  \ way we deliver him to a better place\u201D he answered.\n\nThey moved the body\
  \ of my grandpa from the living room to the yard. It also had been moved from the\
  \ bed to the brown chest where crosses on the left and right.\n\nMourning and compassion\
  \ was getting louder since the body was about to bury. Words were given from relatives\
  \ to his children and his spouse, sentences of comfort and blessings.\n\nPriest\
  \ closed his chest with prayers. His departure was escorted by accompaniment of\
  \ praying and tears from relatives. Good bye grandpa."
