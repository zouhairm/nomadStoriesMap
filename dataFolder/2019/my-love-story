Text: "When I was a kid it was a kind of a ritual of asking myself the same question\
  \ again and again until I used to find a concrete mind satisfying answer but this\
  \ time it was different. Something inside me was troubling so badly that I had no\
  \ clue how to deal with it. I used to get lost within my question every single day\
  \ and my wandering soul was full of curiosity, ego, fear, doubt, insecurity and\
  \ of course in lot of pain. How can I feel so dead when everything blooming so brightly\
  \ outside, how can I not feel the love with a perfect partner in my life, how I\
  \ am still hungry after eating all the meals my life was a beautiful mess wrapped\
  \ up with all the rules and regulations, dos and don\u2019ts of the man-made society.\
  \ But these emotions were quite justified because this time my question was neither\
  \ about things I want, career I want to choose nor regarding choice of life partner,\
  \ this time my question was about myself -\n\nWHO AM I?\n\nWHAT IS MY LIFE\u2019\
  s PURPOSE? \n\nIt was august 2017, my girl gang decided to go for an all-girl trip\
  \ to Indonesia. By that time I had already left my job, broke up with my boyfriend\
  \ after a 6 years of relationship, and was not in good terms with my family as well,\
  \ kind of abandoned myself from all the perks of a happy life. This I called the\
  \ side effects being in the path of awakening. \nWe landed in Bali, Indonesia on\
  \ 3rd of November 2017 practically begged and borrowed money from friends for the\
  \ trip. I was completely emotionally and financially broken when I landed in Bali.\
  \ But the moment I landed and the fresh air of Indonesia touched my face, I knew\
  \ I am at the right place. The first few days of our trip went by doing the usual\
  \ same old ritual of dancing, drinking, pub hopping, guy gazing and visiting major\
  \ tourist attractions. Until the 3rd day when I first experienced the light stirring\
  \ of my sacral chakra, the pleasure making machine of our body, when Tomos a young\
  \ lad from Australia walked towards me in a famous night club in Kuta, i was so\
  \ surprised with the reaction of my body as if everything is in sync. We kissed,\
  \ laughed and danced like no one is seeing us that night, it was not the normal\
  \ me, it was the abnormal me in action. That night I realized Tomos was not a living\
  \ being, he was the beginning of my journey of searching my answers. I realized\
  \ I am worthy of love, I can flirt and I can laugh my heart out. \nNext day it was\
  \ our activity day, Nusa Dua, and it was my day to fall in love with my body. First\
  \ time in my life I wore bikini. Surprisingly I was not shy I was so bold and open\
  \ that everything around me looked so beautiful and soothing, the far stretched\
  \ sea and the restless waves were all like meditation to me. Everybody can already\
  \ see the changes in me, I was no more scared to express, explore and enjoy. I wanted\
  \ to live every moment to the fullest without the worry of who, what & how. I was\
  \ radiating life and without even realizing all my questions were getting answered.\n\
  And then I met Uri, in Gili Island the last destination of our trip a blue eyed,\
  \ fair and tall guy from Barcelona, he was magic, though he was just an ordinary\
  \ guy but within that one night he made me meet all my answers. He made me love\
  \ myself, he made me respect and value my own-self, and he made me realize I am\
  \ no less. That was the climax of my love story, I fallen in love with my own-self\
  \ all over again, I realized everything begins and ends with me and I found my answers.\n\
  \nI AM UNIVERSE, I AM THE LIGHT\n\nTHE PURPOSE OF MY LIFE IS TO REALISE MY WORTH\
  \ AND MY POWERS AND USE IT FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND.\n\nThanks for reading!!"
