Text: "As I landed in Marrakech, I had a sudden feeling run through my entire being.\
  \ Not just my body but my subtle energy bodies as well. When my feet hit the ground,\
  \ I felt as though I was finally home. Please let me acknowledge, I am not Moroccan\
  \ or Arabic by birth but I am a descendent of the Ottoman Empire. As we travel further\
  \ into Marrakech, the sights and sounds started bringing back memories, that I know\
  \ I never actually had, but of memories that my late grandfather shared with us\
  \ as we were growing up. Maing our way into the heart of the city, we decided to\
  \ head to the Medina and Souk as fast as our tired legs would allow. Entering the\
  \ Souk, was bringing everything that my grandfather had shared into reality, the\
  \ colors, fabrics, smells and tastes brought me back to a time where he bartered\
  \ for fabric, meats and olives. As I strolled through, I became a female version\
  \ of him, wanting to barter to get the best price for street treats, like honey\
  \ candy, olives and figs. The fabrics and woven rugs jumped out as I passed by wanting\
  \ me to touch them and of course like a sheltered animal take one home. Finding\
  \ myself carrying not only local foods, but now textiles and a prayer rug, I needed\
  \ to make my way to the Jewish Ghetto, where century old silversmith shops were\
  \ still making beautiful filigree pieces and teaching the local Berber people their\
  \ craft. As the day ended, finding the smallest local restaurant to share Tagine\
  \ was right around the corner, and as our chicken, olive, potato and carrot Tagine\
  \ arrived, the cent and aroma filled the small corner where we shared a local wine\
  \ with our table guests. The night ended walking to our Riad and entering the most\
  \ exquisite tiles floor I had ever seen. Walking up narrow steps, over looking an\
  \ inside courtyard with Moroccan lamps illuminating the walls was like being in\
  \ a dream. Tomorrow, I thought we would climb the Atlas mountains, so a good night\
  \ sleep was waiting for me. Heading towards, the mountains, the views along the\
  \ roads were  humbling and yet so very serene. Watching families, gather and eating\
  \ meals along the streets, friends sharing stories and a coke were plentiful. The\
  \ mountains were waiting to be climbed, and I was about to challenge myself to do\
  \ something I had never done before. At 55, I was going to climb the Atlas mountains,\
  \ stay with a Berber family and share their meals and stories. \nAs we climbed higher\
  \ and higher it became  colder, the peaks of the mountains were visible and covered\
  \ with fresh snow, as we walked the trails we passed many Berber women, washing\
  \ clothes in the streams, children playing with handmade toys and nomads selling\
  \ crystals and blankets. Wanting to buy it all, I felt a kinship with these nomads.\
  \ People who had nothing yet they had everything. they had a connection to their\
  \ people, their land and their culture, just as I have always felt after hearing\
  \ the stories that my grandfather had told, of crossing the Sahara dessert to get\
  \ a better life. In 3 days that would be my next adventure, crossing the Sahara,\
  \ vis camel, sleeping in a Berber tent and telling stories. This journey, filled\
  \ with nomadic treasures both tangible and intangible allowed me to see and feel\
  \ what my grandfather had felt and how there was always sadness in his story telling\
  \ of a time and a place he left behind. having traveled to many places across the\
  \ globe, I feel a connection with each and everyone of them, and just like my grandfather\
  \ always feeling sadness when I leave. Connecting with the many cultures as shown\
  \ me that we are all a little nomadic inside. Hoping my next adventure is one of\
  \ learning another culture, their language and the heart of the people."
