Text: "I was in a harry while taking my shower, stepped out of the bathroom but still\
  \ could hear the sound of water rushing heavily and hitting the floor, I glanced\
  \ at it to make sure I turned off the water, but the moment I realized I did a spark\
  \ of lightning just lit the room, and it was also the moment I was made to choose\
  \ between two hard choices, whether to walk about a 100 yards in the heavy rain\
  \ wearing a suit without an umbrella, a rain that could get me soaked in water from\
  \ the first 5 yards, or just sit in my hostel and miss the orchestra performance,\
  \ a show I have been waiting for months.\nFortunately, I felt warm despite this\
  \ cold weather, thanks to the good meal I have just had in this Syrian restaurant,\
  \ rain was getting heavier every moment but I decided I will put on the suit and\
  \ wait, praying to god that this rain would stop in the right moment, so I started\
  \ saying part of the Christian orthodox mass that I loved \u201CO great, eternal\
  \ god\u201D.\nI remembered the night before walking in the streets of beautiful\
  \ Alexandria with my two friends the sea at our right, hearing the sound of its\
  \ waves, the endless coffee shops at our left still could smell the strong aroma\
  \ of coffee and see the heavy smoke of shisha despite of the strong wind, we were\
  \ getting ready to return to the hostel when we found this unique caf\xE9, it was\
  \ more of museum where you can sit to have a cup of tea because literally every\
  \ corner there had a piece of art, a real mummified lion stood in the entrance,\
  \ a chair made of aquarium where you could sit on glass while fish swim under you,\
  \ we chose to sit on chairs below which a real crocodile was moving separated from\
  \ our shoes by only transparent glass.\nI finished wearing my suit adjusted my tie,\
  \ when suddenly, the rain stopped, O great eternal god, thank you! I hurried up\
  \ to catch a taxi before it starts raining again, hopefully I arrived a few minutes\
  \ early so I bought an umbrella just in case, only then I felt like I was in a good\
  \ classic movie, not a dream! because I have never dreamt beautiful as this, a gentleman\
  \ wearing a suit holding an umbrella is about to attend an orchestra in the winter\
  \ while it\u2019s raining outside, it can\u2019t get any better, I entered the opera\
  \ house found my seat in the middle of the theatre third row, then they entered\
  \ about 30 man and woman, held their instruments that were on their seats, followed\
  \ by the beautiful Ayoub sisters, and they started, the two Scottish girls playing\
  \ their music followed by the Cairo orchestra, smiling at me from time to time,\
  \ I started feeling the music with my heart, they started with an Arab music that\
  \ brought to my mind the Syrian restaurant with its exquisite decoration and the\
  \ mosaic picture of a sultan in the entrance, golden curtains, red fezzes that were\
  \ put on tables, waiters wearing the clothes of Aladdin, man sitting in the corner\
  \ playing \u201COud\u201D and the place that was filled with Islamic art that made\
  \ me feel I was having lunch in Baghdad.  They finished playing the Arab music \u201C\
  Ah Ya Zien\u201D then they shifted instruments Sarah held the violin and Laura the\
  \ cello and played Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201CBilly Jean\u201D I couldn\u2019\
  t resist remembering the museum caf\xE9 with its dim blue light the mummified lion\
  \ standing with its golden hair in the entrance, shelves that were full of statues\
  \ of different ages, quotes hanged on walls, a real mask from the WW1, small mummified\
  \ monkeys that were wrapped in linen hanged on walls, animal head trophies, tiger,\
  \ moose and zebra, a snake moving in a glass box, oh now she is looking at me while\
  \ smiling again, I heard the last applause declaring the end of the concert walked\
  \ out holding my umbrella under the strong rain, bearing a memory linked to the\
  \ aroma of coffee, glad that the senses of this gentleman were satisfied."
