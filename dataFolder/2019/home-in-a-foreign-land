Text: "Home in a foreign land\n\nPotholes and dusty road finally gave way to smooth\
  \ tarmac as we crossed the bridge connecting India and Myanmar.  We stopped to pick\
  \ our travel permit and I reminded myself to be alert when the officer instructed\
  \ me to \u201Cdrive on the right.\u201D  It signalled the need for precaution to\
  \ forget the habitual notion of \u201Cleft is right\u201D for Indian highway.  The\
  \ smooth wide road, however, appealed to our thirst for adrenaline rush.  I was\
  \ accompanied by Hoi, a local friend that I met during one of her visit to Imphal.\
  \  Thriving on the border town market, the international route leading to other\
  \ Asian countries through Myanmar is a boon for people around the border.  This\
  \ highway is also infamous for some illegal business of human trafficking, guns\
  \ and drugs.  My friend survives on the footwear business.  \u201CIt\u2019s a clean\
  \ one,\u201D she assured me at our first meeting when she took a break from her\
  \ work to accompany her father undergoing a treatment in Imphal.  Hoi possesses\
  \ the unique ability to converse in different languages-an asset for people of her\
  \ trade, also utilised for passing through without much inquiry by securities on\
  \ both side.  Otherwise it could have been a long process of interrogation and frisking.\
  \ \n \nDocuments verified, we resumed the ride across miles and wound past calm\
  \ countryside until the long stretch of woods ended in a burst of a lively town-\
  \ Tamu in Sagaing region of Burma.  We stopped for a refill, and my host took me\
  \ to a hotel for a cup of tea.  A poster of Aung San Suu Kyi with an indecipherable\
  \ script filled the walls around us.  I wondered how the transformation from military\
  \ junta to democracy would have been.  However, Hoi, with her good network of acquaintances,\
  \ did not permit me time to dwell on such thoughts.  It was a time for handshakes\
  \ and introduction to some local friends of her.  And to my amazement, although\
  \ being adorned with the traditional Burmese attires these new friends greeted me\
  \ with a familiar language and gesture.  The feeling of being foreign was gradually\
  \ dissolved.  A realisation of the persistent bond of culture across boundaries.\
  \  A television blaring with a Hollywood movie in Burmese audio track added to the\
  \ cacophony of the room.  I was steadily relieved of the tensions of running into\
  \ cruel military personnel that I\u2019d often heard of. \n\n So, off we went to\
  \ resume the winding drive away from the town toward a secluded place of Buddhist\
  \ monastery.  Hoi always made it a point to take visitors to this colourful abode\
  \ of monks before concluding every trip with a taste of local food and conversation.\
  \  We parked our bikes and climbed the steps toward an elevated golden shrine amidst\
  \ a sprawling lush of greenery.  Except for the trilling notes of birds and occasional\
  \ chatter of other visitors there was serenity in the campus.  My friend was already\
  \ conformed to this prevailing atmosphere.  In a span of few hours, this country\
  \ offered different layers of life-from the bustling hub of international trades\
  \ to the silent comfort of pilgrims.  After a brief walk around the temple we headed\
  \ for the cr\xE8me de la cr\xE8me of the day\u2019s itinerary-the roadside chow.\
  \  \n\n\u201CBeef or chicken?\u201D  \n\u201CBeef chow mein,\u201D I responded as\
  \ I pondered upon how Myanmar offered me the comfort of home and food that one could\
  \ barely afford in the capital city of India.  The date on my phone read 7 February,\
  \ 2019.  I should be back to Delhi by the weekend. A very busy city yet to recover\
  \ from the pollution of noise, air, and intolerance including the ban on beef. \
  \ I imagined members of a family aligning themselves to separate identities as they\
  \ conform to the regulations of an imaginary line drawn across lands their ancestors\
  \ once wandered freely.   Our only difference is the domicile we possess, a sheet\
  \ of paper to dictate who could be embraced and who should be distanced.  But for\
  \ a moment I put some effort to savour the temporal bliss of being at home in a\
  \ foreign land."
