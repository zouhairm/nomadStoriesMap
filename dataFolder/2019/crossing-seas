Text: "Walking through the connecting tube, making my way to the plane as I take a\
  \ last glance at the golden sunrise creating a beautifully blended warm palette\
  \ of possibility and nostalgia which colours the sky in a stunning orange gradient.\
  \ It will be a while until I see a sunrise in the Northern hemisphere, and I had\
  \ all 72 seconds to savour it before I am greeted by the flight attendant, dressed\
  \ in blue and white, greeting me with a delightful smile. I smile and kindly nod,\
  \ looking at her slightly tilted cap as I make way to my window seat in the back\
  \ of the plane. My music is at its loudest, I grasp tightly to my boarding pass\
  \ and passport and I sit down. The plane is half empty, only locals seem to be on\
  \ board, I conveniently feel like an outsider. Announcements are made, once in Spanish\
  \ and another in slightly broken English. I try to not let that worry me. \nI fall\
  \ asleep watching Into The Wild, how appropriate! \nI get woken up halfway into\
  \ the flight by the air hostess, who hands me the entry papers. Slightly disoriented,\
  \ time passes. We land. With my big red backpacker\u2019s bag I bought, brand new,\
  \ I walk alongside locals who, one by one, disappear into the arms and cheers of\
  \ their relatives. I exit toward the taxis, the moon is bright and drivers start\
  \ coming my way with great enthusiasm. Hassled a bit and set a fixed price to my\
  \ hostel, I enter and admire the foreign scenery I\u2019m in through the tinted\
  \ windows of a poorly run cab. This seems promising.\nThe next morning, waking up\
  \ after five hours of sleep, I exit my dorm and dine in the open garden terrace.\
  \ Papaya, mango chutney and pancakes for breakfast. I make light conversation and\
  \ breathe in the fresh air under the golden morning sun pressing up against my shoulder\
  \ blade. \nI meet fellow wanderers such as myself and continue along my journey\
  \ with them, I find an unexpected sense of community in the desolate corners of\
  \ Central America.\nWe hiked volcanoes, and mountains, swam in oceans, snorkelled\
  \ on islands, tubed down a river with beers, and hiked in caves. We went skinny\
  \ dipping in lakes after a night out and met one too many handsome traveller. Through\
  \ an irrational act of naive spontaneity disguised as bravery, I found community\
  \ and belonging, as well as countless adventures and memorable nights. There is\
  \ no greater sensation of freedom than the one you get from overlooking an active\
  \ volcano, sitting on the base camp of the third highest volcano in Guatemala, cooking\
  \ the food you brought up, and bonding in a fire circle, enjoying shared camaraderie\
  \ over a glass of hot chocolate as we are greeted by the foggy sunset disappearing\
  \ into the creases between the lakes and mountains. We grilled marshmallows, shared\
  \ stories and warmth in each other\u2019s arms and as we got set to retreat in our\
  \ tents, where we rested before awakening a couple of hours later to catch the sunrise.\
  \ It was with these same people that I later on caught morning waves, line fished\
  \ and went bar hopping in the middle of the Caribbean Ocean. These same people accompanied\
  \ me through the jungle and through desert beaches as we tanned under the golden\
  \ sun, drinking daiquiris.\nThese are the same people I was scared to meet, on that\
  \ gloomy afternoon as I was boarding my plane. These were the same people I was\
  \ afraid I couldn\u2019t share a single connection but somehow ended up becoming\
  \ some of the greatest influences on my life, one full of adventures I cannot wait\
  \ to unlock. All because I took a leap of fate, a leap into the unknown, one out\
  \ of my comfort zone."
