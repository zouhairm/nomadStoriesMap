Text: "I went to Ireland to fall in love. It had been more than two years since my\
  \ first heartbreak, and since then, I felt dried up, flat. I figured I\u2019d have\
  \ more luck across the pond, what with my exotic accent, and so I trailed my best\
  \ friend Ciara through the Southern part of the Isle. When I arrived, I was enthralled\
  \ with the beauty: old, cobbled streets, men with fat lips bouncing cigarettes and\
  \ waving their arms wildly as they spoke. The scenes of the streets we walked along\
  \ were enchanting. I pulled Ciara into old sweet shops, little Inn\u2019s with a\
  \ fire going, fish markets, flower shops, plenty of toilets. All the while, exclaiming\
  \ to myself and to her: \u201CWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if a guy walked into\
  \ this pub right now!\u201D I\u2019d seen the movie \u201CP.S. I Love You\u201D\
  \ and felt sure that my experience abroad would be almost exactly like Holly Kennedy\u2019\
  s.  I\u2019d forgotten, in my frantic imaginings, that I\u2019d be toting my beautiful\
  \ best friend who, on top of having freckles to make the Gods bend, was blonde,\
  \ and the most quietly captivating person I\u2019d ever met. \nIt wasn\u2019t in\
  \ Ciara\u2019s nature to be overt. She blushed as, at nearly every place we went\
  \ into, she was swept off of her stool and into stranger after stranger\u2019s arm.\
  \ Afterward, she neither thanked them for the dance, nor blew them a kiss, but retreated\
  \ abruptly to her perch and hid her face behind her hair. I, meanwhile, had become\
  \ so desperate for a kiss by the midddle of the trip that I had no shame in approaching\
  \ suiters: tapping them on the shoulder, wearing my brightest things. I practically\
  \ purred on the off-chance someone spoke to me.\nToward the end of the trip, I was\
  \ feeling despondent. Ciara had met a man who\u2019d given her an excellent story,\
  \ but she was complaining of a runny nose the entire ride to Cork. Conditions hardly\
  \ improved upon our arrival at the hostel. Ciara was ailing all the more, and nearly\
  \ fainted when she had to bend over backward and kiss the Blarney stone. I left\
  \ our hostel alone and moped into a pub. I chose a table on a lonely floor, where\
  \ a band was taking apart their instruments. I hoovered down a Bulmer\u2019s and\
  \ drew circles and lines on the back of a coaster. I was woring on a moustache on\
  \ a woman on the other side when the voice of Gabriel rang out to me. I had been\
  \ mistaken, the band was only setting up, and I was the only person in the room.\
  \ Normally in these situations I feel panicked, forced to stick to my seat and crank\
  \ out the right expression. But the voice I heard was Ethereal, and it came with\
  \ a face to match it. He was strumming a banjo and had one black eye, and when the\
  \ drummer introduced the band, he called him \u201CHandsome Hugh\u201D. I was transfixed\
  \ for the entire set, and thanked my lucky stars Ciara was confined to her bed.\
  \ Hugh was a school teacher, and when I heard that I nearly fell off my chair. We\
  \ spoke quietly together for almost an hour before the bartender began flipping\
  \ stools.He said perhaps we'd meet again and left me melting when he walked out\
  \ the door.\nCiara went with me as I searched the town the next day for Hugh. We\
  \ tucked into every pub with a notice for Live Music, and in Cork, that was enough\
  \ to get us looped fast. By the time the bus arrived, to take us off to a new city,\
  \ I'd forgotten about him and was busy noshing down meat pies and caramels, blubbering\
  \ about the sights. Upon our first steps into Galway, I knew the place was magical\
  \ and a man pissing into the river confirmed it. He looked right at us as the urine\
  \ flowed and said we had to be the two most beautiful girls this town had ever seen.\
  \ He sang Galway Girl as we walked away laughing, but we knew enough of the lyrics\
  \ to finnish the song on our own."
