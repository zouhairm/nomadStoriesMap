Text: "We all love to travel far and wide, get our passports stamped and take a lifetime\
  \ of a ride but often reality hits our face in the form of high flight tickets or\
  \ no leaves granted.\nWe can't deny of the times when our pockets full of adventures,\
  \ but probably in short of a dime and in moments like these, we should take out\
  \ our travel bags and wear our travel caps and be a tourist in our own city. This\
  \ is a moment from my day when I travelled to Kolkata/Calcutta.It was the first\
  \ time I wanted to explore the city. It was a winter evening and the long stretch\
  \ of roads were leading me home. The yellow and black taxi's which dominate the\
  \ roads of Kolkata, was taking me through markets birming with energy, street vendors\
  \ enthusiastically selling their goods and a beautiful mouthwatering aroma that\
  \ I cross by. I look around and see the beautifully lit roads,huge buildings with\
  \ ancient British architecture and it was colourfully lit up everywhere. A thought\
  \ crosses by - Rongin Shohor (A colourful Calcutta).\nThe city has the old charm\
  \ reflecting from the architectural ethos at every corner.And I stand by,looking\
  \ at the birming roads,I hear the shrill sound of the conch coming from the evening\
  \ prayers while I sink into the calm chaos lingering around me. \nThe smell of Calcutta\
  \ has been fairly intimate and now I can safely tell, it has been quite distinct\
  \ too. Calcutta,is the former British capital of India,boasts of an illustrious\
  \ past which reflects through the fascinating art, marvellous architecture,and declamatory\
  \ literature of the city. Calcutta has been recognised for its thriving culture,art\
  \ and music. I started with Victoria Memorial which was built in honour of queen\
  \ Victoria and this magnificent estate  is the beauty nobody can defy. Then I was\
  \ crossing the Howrah bridge ,which is also known as the 'Harbour bridge of India'.It\
  \ is titled as one of the oldest and busiest place in Kolkata.I also came to know\
  \ that there is something called as \" Jorasanko Thakur Bari\" or the Tagore's House.I\
  \ knew that if I had to know about the culture of Calcutta then i need to travel\
  \ to this place.I was soon headed to the Tagore house which is one of the most important\
  \ historical places in Kolkata,it's a museum which houses a photo gallery, fascinating\
  \ paintings, and Tagore's literary works. Calcutta is a rush,of places like Marble\
  \ Palace,Fort William,Aquatica,Alipore zoo, Dakhimeshwar Kali temple,Kalighat Kali\
  \ temple, St. Paul's Cathedral, Birla Mandir,Nakhoda Mosque,Indian Museum,Princep\
  \ Ghat,Belur Math,and many more.Calcutta isn't just a place,it's a feeling.\n I\
  \ realise why Calcutta is rightly called the City of Joy. If you want Kochuri-alurdom(flat\
  \ bread and potato curry)breakfast that'll suffice two stomachs at rs 10,come here.\
  \ If you want to watch sunset's sitting on a boat standing still in the middle of\
  \ the river Ganga, come here.If you want to smell old books and drink chai(tea)\
  \ from an earthen pot,come here.If you want to learn how to celebrate festivals,come\
  \ here. If you want to find happiness in the smallest of things,come to Calcutta,my\
  \ friend.\nIn this trip I came to terms with understanding that Calcutta is not\
  \ just a metropolitan city of India but also an old school Calcutta.In the narrow\
  \ alleys of book shops in College street.In the afternoon tea and buttered toast\
  \ under the tall ceilings of Indian coffee house.The green shutter windows of the\
  \ architectural houses,the rusty letter box that is still being used. In the smell\
  \ of freshly arrived jaggery at Nalin Chandra sweets.In freshly baked pie at Flury's.\
  \ A walk inside Victoria Memorial holding imperial history,the smell of wet clay\
  \ in the lanes of Kumortuli.In the tinkling bell of a handpull rickshaw, in the\
  \ distant sound of sluggish tram approaching nearer,in dhuti Panjabi (men's local\
  \ dress code) with big black umbrella,in a Satyajit play at Minerva theatre.In the\
  \ afternoon Rabindranath songs,in old sareers hanging loosely in balconies,in the\
  \ evening gatherings by the corner of roads known addas at every lane,a Kingfisher\
  \ pint and chicken steak at Oly Pub. A city that has passed the test of time and\
  \ yet stands gracefully, sometimes almost adamantly declining to move on, refusing\
  \ to catch up.A city brewing with nostalgia. Such is the Old school CALCUTTA."
