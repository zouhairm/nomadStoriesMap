Text: "The day we will never forget started long before the sunrise, long before we\
  \ even knew in which direction to go. The pressure from our Yoga school weighing\
  \ down on our minds and we needed to just go.\nWe had 48hrs.\n22:32 found us indecisive,\
  \ so tired of thinking that no thought was a final decision of where to go the next\
  \ day.\nI looked into Laurens eyes and just said: let's go.\nShe asked where? My\
  \ response was grabbing the bags, the car keys and opening the garage.\nLauren was\
  \ worried. I was frustrated and eager to leave.\nWe were on the N2 out of Cape Town\
  \ by 23:02, the general heading was the Garden Route; we have a soft spot for Knysna\
  \ - about 6hrs East of the great Cape.\n04:20 found us at Victoria Bay, just before\
  \ Kaaimans Pass as we enter the Garden Route via Wilderness.\nWe stopped the car\
  \ and stood in the middle of the empty highway. The world asleep, the stirring of\
  \ nature as the dawn crept closer.\nA half decision encouraged us to travel just\
  \ passed Knysna to Plettenberg Bay, another gem of the Route.\nAs the Sun crawled\
  \ to the West we arrived at Main Beach, Plett. Staring across the waves as we sipped\
  \ a well-deserved cuppa coffee.\nBeacon Isle is one of Plett's defining landmarks,\
  \ she spanned across the sky as the Sun warmed her flanks out in the warm Indian\
  \ Ocean.\nWe bee-lined to the reception to asked about breakfast, they welcomed\
  \ our fatigued-drenched faces to a beautiful buffet.\nWe needed movement, so we\
  \ practiced Yoga and Tai Chi on the rocks, we played croquet with a group of grand\
  \ ladies and gentlemen, we ate fresh oysters from the divers coming up from a sunrise\
  \ dive as we floated through the waves. We lazed and spoke of Yoga and mindful movement\
  \ to everyone around as like an organised gathering, as the Sun peaked and the seagulls\
  \ settled into their perches for a snooze, we did the same.\nHundreds of kilometres,\
  \ many hours and countless friends, laughter and play and letting go; in true Yogic\
  \ nature - we surrendered, went with it and grew from it all.\n\n- END - \n\nThen\
  \ again, there's the Italy trip to find a retreat location in Tuscanny. Scootering\
  \ around Roma at sunset and sunrise and pottering around Grosetto attempting to\
  \ find a mode of transport. Practicing Yoga at La Pescaia resort and meeting some\
  \ sincerely interesting folk along the way.\nOne could say two leaps of faith in\
  \ two different directions.\n\nEither way, with travel, we are gifted with experience.\
  \ Whether in your own country or thousands of miles away; there is a whole world\
  \ of people and places out there that could add an amazing flavour to your life.\n\
  Everyone we meet is someone we can encourage to practice Yoga and mindfulness.\n\
  \nWe hope our next trip involves Yoga and a sidecar motorbike.\n\nIn love and service,\n\
