Text: "The train flew over the desolate swampland, thawing after a long winter. Staring\
  \ out the window only proved fruitful upon entering Harbin: a Northern Chinese city\
  \ teetering on the precipice of spring. The bustling city\u2019s architecture reflected\
  \ its complex history of being swapped between various powers for hundreds of years.\
  \ The Russian St. Sophia Cathedral turned museum, foreign bookstores, and Soviet\
  \ Block Style housing matching the drab sky that hung above. Yet, the most notable\
  \ invader left little trace. Such overlap of cultures was why we were here: my Chinese\
  \ friend asked me to come to a formerly Russian city to seek out Imperial Japanese\
  \ history.\n\nMy friend and I had both held the memories of war at too young an\
  \ age. My father shared movies of Americans defeating Nazis, my friend\u2019s father\
  \ watched Japanese invasion films, ubiquitous on Chinese television. I could outline\
  \ the obvious differences between our countries\u2019 participation in the war but\
  \ I could not accept the anger bordering on rage that I would occasionally find\
  \ in my friend\u2019s eyes. \n\nWe exited the modern bullet train in the midst of\
  \ a crumbling train station and boarded a dilapidated city bus. We rumbled past\
  \ buildings marred with the telltale signs of shoddy, quick construction, dark grey\
  \ watermarks staining lighter grey buildings. The mundane mosaic maintained a forgettable\
  \ beauty. As we exchanged light chatter to avoid the anticipation filling our bellies\
  \ the buildings thinned, one jagged fortress standing alone. \n\nUnit 731 was once\
  \ an empty field, then a prison of sorts and, now a museum. The metal exterior created\
  \ a matte reflection of the landscape. The walls erected at sharp angles stood apart\
  \ from the unremarkable construction of the city. Pointing edges jutted into the\
  \ air. It was not welcoming. Realizing I was holding my breath, we entered. \n\n\
  The interior air was repressive, clinging to the photos memorializing the past.\
  \ Proof after undeniable proof. Vivicide, homicide, and genocide lined the walls.\
  \ Unapologetically exposed to the world, demanding homage. The most intrusive to\
  \ the psyche was the myriad of medical experiments. Reminiscent of the Nazi\u2019\
  s Mengele. Doctors were charged with testing insane theories: freezing and thawing\
  \ limbs, slicing open awake pregnant women, testing deadly diseases on subjects\
  \ before infected fleas would be released into the Chinese general public via weather\
  \ balloons. \n\nThe US Nuclear Bombs were dropped, the Russians invaded and, the\
  \ Japanese evacuated. The few Japanese who remained in China were prosecuted. Then,\
  \ the faces of my friend\u2019s ancestors were replaced with mine. I felt my breath\
  \ adjust to the weight of history.\n\nUS Court Documents confirmed the US pardoning\
  \ of Japanese officials in exchange for data. Men who went on to be celebrated doctors\
  \ and politicians in their homeland, burying their sins with the bodies of those\
  \ they butchered. A collaboration of wretchedness dotted throughout geography, culture,\
  \ and history that apologies and reparations could never erase. \n\nI attempted\
  \ to memorize the images in the final room: cherished photos of victims, accounts\
  \ from survivors, the smiling faces of the children whose ancestors paid a deadly\
  \ price. Progeny looking brightly ahead, promising a thriving China to those that\
  \ came before. \n\nAs we exited, it was still freezing, but the lightness of the\
  \ air made the cold forgettable. The sun dried my still wet cheeks.\n\u201CIt\u2019\
  s a beautiful day,\u201D my friend nearly whispered, as she wrapped her arm around\
  \ mine."
