Text: "I arrived in Tuscany at the height of spring. Though I had spent time in Siena,\
  \ and taken a day trip to Florence, I was not familiar with the Italian countryside.\
  \ I'd brought a new camera lens I wanted to try out in hopes of filling my portfolio\
  \ with gorgeous Tuscan landscapes (if I did not succeed, it could only be operator\
  \ error). I decided to drive to a small village called Lamole in Chianti, where\
  \ there is a nice restaurant with a terrace and views over the valley.\n\nA narrow\
  \ and serpentine road through rows of cypress, oak, and chestnut trees lead the\
  \ way. Here and there, random patches of poppies bloomed. It seemed as if around\
  \ every turn, there was an ancient-looking farmhouse in a vineyard or olive grove.\
  \ \n\n As I rounded another curve in the road, a field of purple irises bloomed\
  \ on the hillside. And yes, there was another charming stone house, this one with\
  \ green shutters and a scooter parked in front. I crossed a little bridge, then\
  \ pulled over to the side thinking, 'this is classic. I have to get this photo!'\n\
  \nThere was an old man standing outside, and reading his body language, I could\
  \ see he wanted to talk. I don't speak much Italian, so I started with a simple,\
  \ \"Buon Giorno.\" By his hand gestures (you can actually have a complete conversation\
  \ in Italian using only hand gestures if necessary), I understood he lived in the\
  \ house, and the scooter was his. Being a polite sort, I asked, \"Posso?\" meaning,\
  \ is it ok if I take some photos? \n\n\"Si,si. Certo.\" He continued to talk and\
  \ motion with his hands. I finally realized he wanted me to take photos of the iris\
  \ fields. He kept saying \"Vai, vai,\" go, go, so off I went, tip-toeing through\
  \ the irises. When I felt satisfied that I'd taken enough photographs, I looked\
  \ up and found him waiting for me by the house. \"Sono belli. Grazie,\" I thanked\
  \ him. He then told me a story, a little history lesson about the irises. \n\nOnce\
  \ upon a time, the iris used to be grown for export to Francia, where the bulbs\
  \ were used to make profumo (perfume). He pointed to the flower and shook his head,\
  \ then pointed to the dirt, indicating the root, and not the flower, was used. He\
  \ was quite emphatic about this. It is very labor-intensive to produce enough of\
  \ these bulbs, taking three years before the first cultivation, and another three\
  \ after that. Now, Cina (China) and Africa export the most iris root used in the\
  \ perfume factories of Francia. Only a very small percentage of production remains\
  \ in Italy. \n\nGood thing I had been listening to Pimsler's Speak and Read Essential\
  \ Italian for the past six months! What had been simply a common field of irises\
  \ was imbued with meaning and symbolism. \n\nI asked him if this was his work, cultivating\
  \ the iris. No, he said. He was now 73 years old and retired. I thought I heard\
  \ the word cameriere, waiter in English; he made a motion with his hands that looked\
  \ like carrying a tray.\n\nHe opened a door on the side of the house, and invited\
  \ me to follow him inside. It was a small room, cool and sunny and smelling of earth.\
  \ He wanted to show me his photos of the iris fields in their glory days. He was\
  \ very direct as he communicated with me, but also very warm and welcoming. His\
  \ eyes were a pale blue, and crinkled when he smiled.\n\nThough we didn't speak\
  \ the same language, and were from different cultures, we understood each other.\
  \ Is there anything more intoxicating than feeling someone else understands you?\
  \ \n\nMy lunch in Lamole awaited, so I said, \"Grazie. Arrivedrci,\" and continued\
  \ down that serpentine road with a feeling of deep satisfaction. The only regret\
  \ I had was that I had not asked his name. Perhaps you will explore the road to\
  \ Lamole one day. If you do, look for the stone building with the green shutters.\
  \ If you see an older man there, please ask him his name, and tell him, \"Buon giorno\
  \ da Penny in Texas.\""
