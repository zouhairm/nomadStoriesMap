Text: "As I sip my coffee at the station, a loud speaker interrupts, \u201CThe 6:30\
  \ PM train from Venice to Paris is cancelled.\u201D\nMy mind goes blank, and I question\
  \ my ears. But the announcement comes again a minute later, and the news flashes\
  \ on the electronic board. I\u2019m stranded! After two months of traveling Europe,\
  \ I\u2019m broke, and every Euro and cent I have is precious! I\u2019ve never been\
  \ so down and out while traveling in Europe.\nBack inside, the woman at the information\
  \ counter gives me a token. \n\nWhen I reach the counter, she informs me Train Italia\
  \ has arranged passage to Milan for 9:00 PM. From there, a bus will take me to Paris.\n\
  \nI move from the queue and the woman behind me rushes to the counter and blurts\
  \ out something in a frenzy of Italian.\n\nEveryone in line quiets and stares at\
  \ the woman with her head down.\n\nThe Italian woman at the desk begins fidgeting.\
  \ She looks around and calls for her supervisor. Together, they usher the woman\
  \ to a room.\n\nAfter half n hour, I stop to breathe in the ambiance, then turn\
  \ as a woman walks up to me, the same woman who broke into sobs at the counter in\
  \ the station. She seems calmer now.\n\n\u201CI suppose you would catch the train\
  \ to Milan too?\u201D she asks.\n\u201CYes. That\u2019s my plan.\u201D\nI study\
  \ her face. She\u2019s beautiful, but her  eyes still smudged with mascara and bear\
  \ the traces of tears.\n\u201CThe train doesn\u2019t leave until nine thirty,\u201D\
  \ she complains.\n\u201CI know.\u201D\n\u201CSo, come along with me.\u201D A smile\
  \ flashes on her face.\n\u201CTo where?\u201D\n\u201CI have two tickets for a cruise.\u201D\
  \n\u201CCruise?\u201D\n\u201COn a gondola! How can I leave Venice without a gondola\
  \ ride. Come!\u201D\nThe next moment we are on the gondola!\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D\
  \ I ask, amazed with this transformation.\nHer smile broadens. \u201CI am Sol, named\
  \ for the sun.\u201D\nA breathtaking pink sunset hovers over the blue waters of\
  \ Venice as the gondola pushes off.\n\nThe Gondola stops at the Venice home of Marco\
  \ Polo, and tourists flock to take pictures. Sol and I disembark and walk to the\
  \ house that butts the Grand Canal. She studies it nostalgically, neck curved, expressive\
  \ eyes glistening. \u201CIn my childhood, Pa used to tell me stories of Marco Polo,\
  \ and I dreamed one day I\u2019d see the world in his tradition. So, I travel when\
  \ I can, and I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m Italian.\u201D\n\u201CBut Sol is\
  \ Spanish.\u201D\n\u201CThat\u2019s because my mother is Spanish. She always had\
  \ it in her mind to call her daughter \u2018Sun.'\u201D\n\u201CA beautiful name\u2026\
  .\u201D\n\u201CBut sometimes the sun burns you\u2013so much that you can see the\
  \ darkness beside the light.\u201D\nI look at her, and she turns her eyes from me.\n\
  \u201CI love this touch of Italy,\u201D I say wistfully.\n\u201CItaly is wonderful,\
  \ but these famous places are too crowded. If you want to feel Italy then come with\
  \ me to the villages where there is nothing but beauty and the Mediterranean caresses\
  \ your feet.\u201D\n\u201CGlorious! Take me!\u201D I exclaim.\nShe glanced at me.\
  \ \u201CI think I can trust you. I\u2019d like to take you to my village someday\
  \ where you could sleep, relax and breathe. You could live out the Renaissance,\
  \ in every moment!\u201D\n\u201CWhat a lovely way to put it.\u201D\n\u201CIll take\
  \ you. But not now. I need to get to Paris, as soon as possible. It\u2019s an emergency.\u201D\
  \n\u201CIs everything all right?\u201D\n\u201CI can\u2019t answer that. I\u2019\
  m sorry,\u201D she responds.\nShe pulls A Farewell to Arms, by Ernest Hemingway,\
  \ my favorite book, from her backpack, and I smile.\n\u201CHave you read this?\u201D\
  \ I ask.\n\u201CMaybe fifty times. I read from it everyday.\u201D She replies.\n\
  \u201CExtraordinary. So do I. Hemingway is my inspiration.\u201D\n\u201CThen you\u2019\
  ll love to hear this.\u201D\n\u201CHear what?\u201D\n\u201CMy father comes from\
  \ Fossalta.\u201D\n\u201CWhat?\u201D I shout. \u201CWhere A Farewell to Arms was\
  \ born?\u201D\n\u201CYes, where Hemingway was wounded.\u201D\nI take her hand. \u201C\
  May I meet your father?\u201D\n\u201CNot now, Silly! The boatman is bringing us\
  \ to shore, and we don\u2019t want to miss our train.\u201D\nWe get to the station\
  \ at nine thirty, just in time for the train to Milan."
