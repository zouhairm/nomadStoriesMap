Text: "I was astonished, my mind couldn\xB4t function properly as my gaze moved across\
  \ the scene. It was a portrait I\xB4ve never seen before. \nIt\u2019s time to go!\
  \ The biggest hammock in the world awaits! I kept thinking whilst making random\
  \ chores to keep chatting with an amazing girl I met the night before. Eloise, a\
  \ passionate living girl whom I fell in love instantly after exchanging thoughts.\
  \ But we both had our plans and after some toast and a nice cup of coffee, I made\
  \ my way to the local market of Santa Marta, where I was meant to find the shuttle\
  \ station to Minca. \nThe sun is shining over the Caribbean city, 100% humidity\
  \ and 33 Celsius are not the optimal conditions to wander around the city looking\
  \ for a non-existing bus station, thankfully, Colombians are kind enough to give\
  \ me directions to find a bench outside a little travel agency shop.\nI enter the\
  \ place and asked for a one-way ticket to my destiny.\n\u201CThe van will arrive\
  \ shortly, Qui\xE9res un Tinto?\u201D - (would you like a coffee) the lady at the\
  \ reception asked kindly. We exchanged looks, I was damped in sweat, we both smiled.\
  \ \nThe temperature starts lowering down as we enter the Sierra Nevada; the palm\
  \ trees and jungle vegetation begins to give way to the forest-like scenery. Not\
  \ long after, we arrived at the main street of the town. Eager to work moto-taxi\
  \ riders approached me offering their services. \n\u201CEverything is in the middle\
  \ of the mountains, it\xB4ll take you hours to get to your hostel\u201D Juan, the\
  \ only rider with a map convinces me to hire his services. \nLittle I knew the ride\
  \ was going to be an adventure itself, the decadent dirt roads over the steep hills\
  \ were a serious task to overcome, falling rocks and muddy paths were in the way\
  \ to my mission of sleeping in a hammock over the clouds. But Juan was a skilled\
  \ rider and we made it to Finca la Victoria in one piece. The smell of freshly roasted\
  \ coffee was enough reward to keep going, but the chocolaty-nutty taste of it gave\
  \ us the energy to keep going.\nNext stop was Los Pinos lookout, the highest point\
  \ on the map. I was dazzled by the scene, the sea and sky blended in orange colors\
  \ in between layers of white puffy clouds. At the top of the hill in complete solitude\
  \ the house of an interesting man, who I exchanged stories with over an exquisite\
  \ Colombian rum.\n \u201CThe sun is going, we must go, otherwise the road could\
  \ get dangerous\u201D Juan pointed out. \nI can see the gigantic hammocks floating\
  \ over the grass from the reception. Check-in is done and I let myself go with a\
  \ tingling sensation inside my body. The landscape in front of me was indescribable,\
  \ the sea was above the clouds, reflecting the shimmering lights of the city over\
  \ the lush green mountain range; covering everything with a subtle mantle of stars\
  \ was the deep blue sky. I felt embraced by the beauty of our planet. \n\u201CThis\
  \ must be heaven!\u201D I commented to a guest I just met. \n\u201Cwait for dinner\
  \ to be served\u201D he replied with a big smile. \n\nDinner is served for everyone\
  \ at the same time, sitting on the edge of the hill a long wooden table is a perfect\
  \ place to eat a meal, there\xB4s only one thing on the menu, making it feel like\
  \ a family reunion. The stars illuminate our plates while a tucan flies over our\
  \ heads. \nIt is time to sleep, I try to get comfortable in my sleeping hammock\
  \ when I realize this wasn\xB4t such a great idea. Buzzing insects, a big bright\
  \ light over my head and a cold breeze were enough for me to bail on my quest. \
  \ \nCan I get a room, please? I don\u2019t feel like ruining this day."
