Text: "\"What are these called?\"  I asked eagerly, pointing to perfectly iced, round\
  \ cookies about the size of a coaster. The plump lady behind the Nuremberg market\
  \ stand leaned over her immaculate display of fresh cakes, cookies, and marzipan\
  \ delicacies and said from the back of her throat:  \"Leb-kuchen!\".  I hadn't heard\
  \ that word in over a decade. In fact I had forgotten all about it. The last time\
  \ I tasted the dense, spicy gingerbread was when my mother handed me a piece of\
  \ hers to share. It was one of her favorite Christmas treats. I promptly purchased\
  \ one and hurried to the nearest covered doorway, the round lebkuchen in one mittened\
  \ hand, a mug of fragrant mulled wine in the other.  \n\nI was born in Germany to\
  \ American parents and, although I was raised in the U.S. since the age of two,\
  \ I remembered subtle German influences on my childhood.  Perhaps most memorable\
  \ was when my parents would search specialty food stores at Christmastime to find\
  \ lebkuchen.  \"It means 'love cake',\" my mother would say with a smile, handing\
  \ me an iced disk of the chewy gingerbread.  I remembered the distinct, rich flavors\
  \ of cinnamon, anise, cloves, nutmeg, orange peel and ginger tasting mature, not\
  \ too sweet, and most of all, comforting.  After my mother's passing in 2001, a\
  \ decade hustled by, and on that return trip to Germany in December 2011, I felt\
  \ time pause in the middle of the frosty Nuremberg market.  In 2011 I was the same\
  \ age that my mother was when she lived abroad in Germany.  I wondered if she had\
  \ meandered through that festive holiday market just as I did.  I wondered if the\
  \ same cozy stalls and colorful treasures that captivated me had enticed her as\
  \ well. I wondered whether that market smelled the same as it did 30 years before,\
  \ a mix of cooking meat, sweet baked goods, and slushy snow.  I suspected that it\
  \ did.  That's when I realized that it was still possible to share an experience\
  \ with my mother.  Never mind that we walked the narrow streets of that holiday\
  \ market 30 years apart; it was in real time for me. \n\nI felt compelled to share\
  \ the joy of my find, simple as it was. After my trip to Germany, I was attending\
  \ my cousin's wedding in Michigan, and both of my mom's sisters would be there.\
  \  What better gift to give at a wedding than \"love cake\"? I quickly headed back\
  \ to the same beautiful market stand and purchased two packages of lebkuchen, one\
  \ for each of my aunts. \n\nThe next week after settling in to my hotel in Ann Arbor,\
  \ Michigan, I brought the mostly-uncrushed packages of genuine lebkuchen to the\
  \ lobby and presented them to my aunts.  They both looked slightly surprised, though\
  \ they expressed sincere thanks.  They told me that they had first had lebkuchen\
  \ with my mother in Germany in the early 1980s when they visited her there.  They\
  \ said that my gift instantly reminded them of her, and they wondered how I could\
  \ have known? \"What does it mean again?\" they asked me.  \"Love cake,\" I replied\
  \ with a smile. \n\nIn the years that followed, as I've searched for lebkuchen to\
  \ share with my family, I've learned that \"lebkuchen\" simply translates to \"\
  gingerbread\". But my children will savor it every Christmastime, and they will\
  \ know it as the \"love cake\" that their grandmother adored."
