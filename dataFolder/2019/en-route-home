Text: "\u201CMaking a local connection\u2026\u201D \nwith Hong Kong would be a breeze,\
  \ I thought, given my parents had immigrated from Hong Kong to Australia in the\
  \ late 1970s and I could speak Cantonese, the local language. As we descended into\
  \ Hong Kong International Airport \u2013  colloquially known as Chek Lap Kok Airport\
  \ \u2013  beads of sweat started to form on the tip of my nose, a sensation unfamiliar\
  \ to me for the month of June, having lived the majority of my life in the southern\
  \ hemisphere.  Managing to pack my life into a 40kg suitcase, I was excited about\
  \ this new chapter in my life, the experience of \u2018returning to the homeland\u2019\
  \ as an Australian-born Chinese.  As my cab pulled up in front of my contemporary\
  \ serviced apartment in Sheung Wan, multi-coloured promotional flyers haphazardly\
  \ taped to the walls of dilapidated commercial buildings to my left flapped in the\
  \ breeze, presenting themselves wherever there were breaks between local shopfronts.\
  \ Ahead, was a young woman in her thirties hammering away at abandoned white goods,\
  \ metal fixtures and the like, savouring any commercial steel she could to make\
  \ her keep for the day.  I vividly remember thinking that she was around my age\
  \ and wondered what kind of family circumstances she was in to have to resort to\
  \ making her means like this?  I had always perceived Hong Kong to be an advanced\
  \ Asian economy \u2013 a financial hub of the world.  So why was I witnessing such\
  \ juxtaposition of the old versus new world? This was literally happening in the\
  \ street next to the serviced apartment I was staying in.\n\nA simple walk around\
  \ the block made me realise my current make-up regime was not going to work, with\
  \ the humidity showing no mercy. As my face melted with me in the scorching summer\
  \ heat, I walked past a traditional snake restaurant, famous for its snake soup,\
  \ displaying live snakes at its shopfront.  Shuddering even at the sight of these\
  \ snakes, I dared not even go in for a browse.  Maybe it\u2019s because Australia\
  \ is home to the top three most venomous snakes in the world that I had been conditioned\
  \ to stay as far away from snakes as possible.   To this day, I have not gone into\
  \ this store, but having heard recently that the sifu (master) snake handler is\
  \ retiring soon at the age of 90, I am putting it on my bucket list to face my fears\
  \ and go back there to try snake soup before the shop closes down for good after\
  \ 110 years of trading.  This is a cultural experience that could die with the closure\
  \ of this shop and I feel as though I need to try this \u2013 even just a sip \u2013\
  \ to see if snake soup truly has the super-warming qualities that Chinese medicine\
  \ claims it has, and to have a chance at better understanding my cultural heritage."
