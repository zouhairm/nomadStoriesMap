Text: "I\u2019m finally sailing to the Aran Islands, my Irish Holy Grail. Vanishing\
  \ lands in the fog, immortals in the ocean rage; I disappear with them as I\u2019\
  m getting closer. Am I following Oisin and Niamh\u2019s steps when then rode the\
  \ ocean to reach the Eternal Youth Land?\nNiamh, princess of the Sidh, is dizzy\
  \ of her love for Oisin, a Fenian warrior that she\u2019s never met, but whom she\
  \ knows every war song thanks to the Dannan poets\u2019 magic. Riding her ocean\
  \ horse, she lands on Ireland shores, her eyes green and pale like the sea, glowing\
  \ with adoration. Oisin\u2019s heart breaks so beautifully shinning that God messenger\
  \ is, so dreamy the life she offers could be; he runs away his arms around his Fairy.\
  \ They live an endless joy in their oblivious world, but Oisin longs for his native\
  \ land and he leaves on his beloved wife\u2019s white horse, promising he will soon\
  \ come back. He doesn\u2019t recognize the world he finds though, his old world\
  \ is dead. Full of despair, he only wants to go home where Niamh vanishes his tears\
  \ with her magic song. But his horse trips, he falls and instantly turns into a\
  \ very old man. The horse disappeared in the stars and Oisin loses everything. Only\
  \ remains memories of an endless night, sometimes pierced by ocean laments and immortal\
  \ Niamh\u2019s love song. \n\nAs I land in Cill Ronain, I leave my Celtic dreams:\
  \ like Synge, I\u2019ve never seen such a barren land. Haze is my only haven since\
  \ everything is hazy: Irish land, clouds, sun, horizon between sky and sea. I discover\
  \ Inishmore piece after piece, but Inishmore violently keeps its secrets secret.\
  \ Inishmore hurts my feet, Inishmore hurts my heart. I\u2019m full of hope every\
  \ step, though, filled with joy. I\u2019m so grateful for the hidden treasures Inishmore\
  \ chooses for my tired feet; my favorite place being Dun Duchatair\u2026\nI\u2019\
  ll always remember my first encounter with it: the wild ocean breaking on the cliffs\
  \ in the first lights. Alone in front of that endless blue world, I can understand\
  \ how people used to think they lived on the edge of the Earth, alone in the whole\
  \ planet: I taste every second of that fleeting feeling of being utterly complete.\
  \ I\u2019m already so moved, when the next landscape deserves a better elegy.  \
  \ \nIt\u2019s huge. So rough. I\u2019m standing between the sharp ground and ocean,\
  \ I\u2019m facing perditions which ate so many fishers by sea, so many travelers\
  \ on earth. I understand now the knitwears\u2019 stories: in the Old Days, each\
  \ family had its own knitting stitch and when fishers buried in oceans came home,\
  \ rought by the swell, weeks after they had disappeared, the jumpers\u2019 stitches\
  \ were the only way to recognize the dead. \nTravel books name all the forts we\
  \ are supposed to visit on the Western Islands but they forget the essential: Dun\
  \ Duchatair doesn\u2019t really matter, the rocks where it\u2019s hanging on do,\
  \ the empty ocean below do. It\u2019s like a storm in my heart in that cold morning.\
  \ The powerful water looking upon me is mesmerizing, breaking on the rocks, murderer\
  \ with only one wave. I\u2019m fascinated by its violence, longing to get lost in\
  \ its rage. \n\nAfter four days out of time and space, I sail away, gazing at Inishmore\
  \ like I\u2019ve never seen it. I was looking for Synge\u2019s islands and I found\
  \ mine, I now have their stories in my heart without seeking a forgotten past. Foreign\
  \ words gathered in crossroads \u2013 Teampall Bheamain. Dun Duchatair. Dun Aengus.\
  \ \u2013 created the unknown I was looking for. I might come back one day\u2026\
  \ In the meanwhile, I will remember that man with such a red face I thought he was\
  \ an alcoholic. Then I looked at my own face in the mirror and I understood his\
  \ face was telling me the story of wind and rough elements\u2019 struggle.\n\nAre\
  \ those out of time islands on the way to the legendary Other World, when it\u2019\
  s trapped in the ocean? Are they the last stop before Tir fo Thuinn, the land under\
  \ the swell? Maybe, maybe not. But in my own secret stories, they are the land I\
  \ left all my troubles."
