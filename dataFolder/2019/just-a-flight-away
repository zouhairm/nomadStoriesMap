Text: "\u201COnce you get to know the people of \u2026 you\u2019ll never be the same.\
  \ Their perspectives sharpen your vision. The challenges of their environment invigorate\
  \ you. Their lives awaken your curiosity. Experience the people and majesty of ...\
  \ with Adventure Company ... We\u2019ll challenge your body and mind. We\u2019ll\
  \ sharpen your understanding of the world and yourself. We\u2019ll emblazon your\
  \ memory with reflections that will expand your mind for years to come.\u201D \n\
  \nI zip through travel literature at the airport\u2019s stall and encounter one\
  \ platitude after the other. \u201CTravel is a mindset,\u201D \u201CTravel should\
  \ be transformative.\u201D Media is fueling the fire of the travel as a life-altering\
  \ experience,  existential adventure and the glue to connecting cultures. I search\
  \ for free wifi. The most common local connection modern travelers make is the next\
  \ local uplink to the internet. \u201CTravel is the ultimate bridge.\u201D \n\n\
  I enter the plane and find my seat. The bridge of any contemporary traveler is an\
  \ airplane. I open up the airline\u2019s magazine. Its CEO puts it more bluntly\
  \ in the editorial note: \u201CAir transport is the engine driving economic growth,\
  \ and we are happy to contributing to this growth.\u201D  \n\nLooking out of the\
  \ window during takeoff, I am dazzled by the magnificent views over the Bay area\
  \ below, the Atlantic Ocean in the distance, before the red-orange light of sunset,\
  \ and a blanket of clouds cover everything. The paradox of flying: looking out the\
  \ window you can't fail to notice what a truly precious and fragile planet this\
  \ is. But then also the emissions of you flying contribute to its destruction.\n\
  \nIt needs a Swedish school girl with Asperger Syndrome initiating worldwide school\
  \ strikes and taking on traveling on long train rides across Europe to speak in\
  \ front of the World Economic Forum and UN Climate Summit to focus media\u2019s\
  \ attention towards the obvious fact: We need a radical change in policies and lifestyle;\
  \ otherwise any generation after us \u2013 if not ourselves - will pay dearly.\n\
  \nTravel will not only be profoundly impacted by global warming through a changing\
  \ climate and sea level rise, but it is also a significant factor that drives it:\
  \ According to the UNWTO tourism accounted for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions\
  \ in 2005. A recent study published in 2018 estimates it already at 8% - excluding\
  \ aviation\u2019s non-CO2 emissions, which are still hard to quantify but potentially\
  \ hit with double the impact. The transformative experience is just a flight away.\n\
  \nThe flight attendants serve refreshments. I enjoy tea and tomato juice with salt\
  \ and pepper in disposable plastic cups. According to the WEF, we dump the equivalent\
  \ of one garbage truck of plastic into the ocean each minute. Researchers expect\
  \ there to be more plastic than fish in the sea by the year 2050. Just one more\
  \ factor by which homo sapiens (economicus) is digging the graveyard of biodiversity\
  \ \u2013 and, ultimately, his own.\n\nI read a story from a major newspaper's selected\
  \ traveler going around the world to 52 places in a year, logistical and personal\
  \ challenges, what she learned. It bores me to death. I turn the pages and find\
  \ tips for green traveling such as shutting your window shades during landing, as\
  \ it conserves energy, I find gadgets to deal with jet lag. There is a simple strategy\
  \ for both: Go slow. Travel local.\n\nIs there a human right to a beach vacation\
  \ in Thailand? A stroll through Venice? Is there a human right to travel at all?\
  \ Is the life-changing yoga retreat in India, the hike through Africa, the surf\
  \ camp in Indonesia, the eco-lodge in the rain forest worth wrecking the future\
  \ of your children? Who should be allowed to travel? And why? What is sustainable\
  \ travel? \n\nThe crew prepares for landing. The ground is illuminated by the lights\
  \ of sprawling suburbia, freeways cutting through it like blood vessels in an obese\
  \ body. We are heading towards the distant blackness of the sea \u2013 the Pacific\
  \ Ocean. I am looking forward to kissing my wife, who lives and works here. It feels\
  \ a bit like home \u2014 a bit. But I have to leave in less than 90 days. My passport\
  \ and my bones originate from another continent."
