Text: "\u201CThe ultimate ramen is something that exists perfectly in the moment\_\
  and then disappears,\u201D the documentary trails off. \n\nOn my 27th birthday,\
  \ I fought against all odds and sought out the best ramen* in all of Japan. I dropped\
  \ everything that morning for what I hoped would be my life\u2019s best bowl of\
  \ soup. I hurriedly left the comforts of my hotel room that had the perfect eye-level\
  \ view of the futuristic Sky Tree, a tower that resembles a tree when lit aglow.\
  \ I skipped a delicious bento breakfast prepared by the chef to save my appetite\
  \ for a meal I expected to be ten times better. I was out the door by 8 AM, fully\
  \ determined to eat at the quaint ramen shop whose documentary left me wanting to\
  \ have an ultimate ramen experience of my own, whatever it took. Even if it meant\
  \ possibly missing my flight back home to Manila.  \n\nAn hour of commute and switching\
  \ of trains from Tokyo to Chiba later, I arrived at a residential area with the\
  \ shops on the street only opening its business day a little past 9 AM. The Starbucks\
  \ branch seemed to be in full swing, but with four other people inside it had pretty\
  \ modest movement.   \n\nI had read sufficient reviews on how to find the place\
  \ that I could trace the route in my mind, as soon as I took the left exit at the\
  \ station. There was no queue when I got to the shop, only a vendo machine that\
  \ dispensed a ticket with your order and your time slot. It said 12:30 PM. My flight\
  \ was set to leave at 3 PM and calculating the travel time back to my hotel and\
  \ then to the airport with the traffic, I realized I only had half an hour tops\
  \ to finish my meal. \n\nOne of the soup chefs featured in the documentary was cleaning\
  \ the store front. I turned to him and asked if I can get in earlier and he shook\
  \ his head. Maybe I spoke too fast, I thought, so I brought out my mobile phone\
  \ and opened my app to translate my request. Still no, he waved his hands. He went\
  \ inside and called on another familiar face featured in the documentary who seemed\
  \ more comfortable communicating in English. \n\n\u201CThere\u2019s another shop\
  \ down the road if you\u2019re in a hurry,\u201D he told me. I thought about his\
  \ suggestion. Hard. What my next move essentially sets the tone on how the next\
  \ year of my life will be. This, of course, feel like a proverbial test of character\
  \ the Universe was throwing at me on my special day. Do I take the good enough option\
  \ or do I risk it all for something that could be great? \n\nYou only live once,\
  \ the battle cry of the young and the restless goes, so of course, I stayed. \n\n\
  As the shop opened at 11AM, I watched different groups come and go each leaving\
  \ the shop with a satisfied look. \u201CIf I don\u2019t make it in time for the\
  \ surprise dinner you\u2019re throwing, please have my cake,\u201D I texted my mom.\
  \ I waited a few more hours and was finally called inside. \n\nThere, the Chef glowed\
  \ how ramen gods glow and directed me to my seat. He prepared everything by hand,\
  \ carefully arranging the placement of the noodles, adding the final garnish, and\
  \ making sure the egg was perfectly cut in the middle. His cooking was a show in\
  \ itself, an art come to life. I wanted to watch him cook forever but was also conscious\
  \ that it was taking time away from the 30 minutes I had to eat. \n\nFinally, he\
  \ plopped down a piping hot bowl of soup with the noodles on the side. Slurp it,\
  \ he said with a smile. True enough, it was the best noodles I have had in my life:\
  \ no frills, exquisite in all senses, everything I imagined it to be and more. \n\
  \nAnd in a quick moment, gone."
