Text: "The road trip was a great adventure as we passed through the many rough and\
  \ cranky roads of the south to Obudu. The road that led to the waterfall was a very\
  \ busy one with many traders and villagers selling their wares, as we drove further\
  \ from the commercial area the road became more isolated, mountains and hills of\
  \ different sizes stood by the road side.\n   We passed the security check and arrived\
  \ at the mountain base waiting for the tour bus to take us up the 1600metres mountain,\
  \ the electronic cars were not functioning at the moment, going with the bus was\
  \ the only option we had.\n The mountain base served as a settlement for locals\
  \ who planted cocoa and banana. Banana was the predominant cash crop at the mountain\
  \ base.\n\n    We went through the windy road with each turn unveiling the beautiful\
  \ scenery of the mountain, one is welcomed with mountain ranges and valleys, the\
  \ mountain ranges were covered with green grasses from top to bottom; the sky was\
  \ different from what was down hill, it was the most amazing deep bright blue sky\
  \ I have ever seen, encompassed with so much peace and aura.\n\n   Proceeding up\
  \ the windy road, at different turns were farmers, mostly women walking down the\
  \ mountain carrying farm produce on their heads in a local bowl to the mountain\
  \ base where it will be sold or consumed domestically.\nThe vehicle was soon in\
  \ front of the hotel on the mountain top, it was the most fascinating place I have\
  \ ever seen, the whole mountain was filled with fog as if precipitation in form\
  \ of snow will come down the next minutes. The semi temperate climate was so dazzling\
  \ and different from the normal Nigerian climate which is usually very hot. I felt\
  \ like I was in the US.\n  I didn't expect to find such place in Nigeria, this is\
  \ another world in the same country I said to myself, traders were close to the\
  \ hotel selling local varieties of antelope, rabbits meats, snails and drinks to\
  \ tourist at the mountain top.\n     The rugged topography of the mountain was a\
  \ mixture of gentle and steep slope, green grasses covering major parts of the mountain\
  \ beautifying the environment. We took a walk down the road from the hotel and found\
  \ a cluster of grazing cattle in the mountain valleys. Moving from that spot, we\
  \ passed through a narrow way filled with different species of trees, they formed\
  \ a canopy with their leaves.\n  Soon we were on a bridge made with local net to\
  \ enables us go across a deep valley beneath us, I didn't know what to expect at\
  \ the end of the rope; we could hear the sounds of insects, birds and animals blended\
  \ in sweet harmony, the bridge led us to an iron steel stair case which took us\
  \ high up to view the valley very closely.\nHeading back to the passage, I noticed\
  \ a particular type of trees that had other branches wrapped up around it, it was\
  \ an amazing sight.\n  The fog was getting dense as we walked further into the mountain,\
  \ the fog shrouded the houses most of which was made from very fine wood, others\
  \ were made like local huts with thatched roofs giving the mountain a blend of the\
  \ Nigerian culture and international blend.\n\n  At the northeastern part of the\
  \ obudu plateau was a mini waterfall at the grotto, the water was in its purest\
  \ form, it flowed freely on the rock as it met with small rock pebbles along its\
  \ path.\nJust outside the grotto were locals who had donkeys used for transporting\
  \ tourist round the mountain.\n   I interacted with some locals staying on the obudu\
  \ plateau, who gave us details of the types of plants grown there which are primarily\
  \ Cocoa and Banana.\nWe walked down to the hotel lobby, it was designed with many\
  \ sculptures and animal skin. \nThe mountain was beyond what I thought it would\
  \ be."
