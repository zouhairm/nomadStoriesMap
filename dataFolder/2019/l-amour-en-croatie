Text: "My mind raced as I stood waiting on the docks of the Dubrovnik marina.\n \n\
  My new friends, who I\u2019d spent the past week with exploring the islands of Croatia\
  \ were continuing on into the centre of Dubrovnik, and I, apparently, was moments\
  \ away from sailing off on a yacht with a Frenchman I\u2019d met only days before.\n\
  \ \nI hugged them goodbye as they wished me good luck. It was them who had convinced\
  \ me to take this opportunity in the first place since the 110% organised, itinerary\
  \ planned right down to the last meal budget, safety cautious traveller in me had\
  \ been tossing between yes or no for the last couple of days.\n \nLuckily, I made\
  \ the decision to dive right into uncertainty.\n \nOur first night was spent under\
  \ the stars \u2013 we set up our mattress on the bow of the yacht and I caught myself\
  \ in a trance admiring how the far-off shore lights floated like lanterns against\
  \ a void backdrop, merging from sea to land to sky. He cooked gnocchi and we drunk\
  \ wine while jazz played softly. Later, we fell asleep to the salty summer breeze\
  \ on our cheeks.\n \nThe following day, we sailed to a serene bay on an island called\
  \ \u0160\u0107edro \u2013 which we later found translates to \u2018lovely\u2019\
  , perfectly capturing the essence of the tiny inlet. Here we discovered an old abandoned\
  \ church, which had surrendered itself to the encompassing nature around it. At\
  \ dinner, we delved deeper into the minds of each other, sharing past adventures\
  \ and discussing our own philosophies for life.\n \nWhen we arrived back to Split\
  \ the next day, we were unready to part. And so, he decided to accompany me back\
  \ to finally discover the Old Town in Dubrovnik. After two more days together admiring\
  \ the white limestone ridges of the Croatian landscape, speckled with greenery and\
  \ terracotta roofs, contrasting with the deep Adriatic blue, it was finally time\
  \ for me to leave and meet my family in Greece as had been planned.\n \nA week passed\
  \ in Greece, but my mind was still in Croatia. He asked if it would be possible\
  \ to see each other again and on impulse I booked a last-minute flight to spend\
  \ one final night with him in Dubrovnik before returning home to New Zealand. I\
  \ don\u2019t know if I was hoping for some sort of closure after this. Instead I\
  \ learnt that perhaps travel romances like these aren\u2019t supposed to feel \u201C\
  finished\u201D and rather it\u2019s better to leave them this way before they become\
  \ tainted by reality. \n \nAs I boarded the bus to the airport, I leant in for one\
  \ last kiss ignoring the irritated grunt of the impatient bus driver. Finally, I\
  \ pulled away, lugged my overpacked bag down the crammed aisle and gazed out the\
  \ window for one last view of my French love. When the bus pulled away from the\
  \ curb, he pressed his fingers to his lips then reached them out toward me and my\
  \ chest grew tight knowing that this would be the final scene of our Croatian love\
  \ affair and furthermore that in a few days I would be back home on the other side\
  \ of the world.\n \nDespite the vulnerability and sense of loss I felt following\
  \ our final goodbye and the realisation that maintaining any form of contact would\
  \ be pointless \u2013 there is nothing I would change about this experience. It\
  \ taught me spontaneity. It taught me passion. But perhaps, most of all, it taught\
  \ me the value of connection - no matter how transient - as well as how little collections\
  \ of memories like these combine like a sequence of flashing lights to create the\
  \ tales of our lives. Like the distant city lights that we gazed upon on our first\
  \ night each tiny star has its place in decorating the entire landscape.\n \nEventually\
  \ this memory will stop shining so brightly and my chest will begin to hurt less\
  \ with longing at the mention of Croatia, but for now, I will keep it as a reminder\
  \ to open myself up to the unexpected. Never did I expect to experience love in\
  \ Croatia... but never could I have ever planned an adventure more unforgettable."
