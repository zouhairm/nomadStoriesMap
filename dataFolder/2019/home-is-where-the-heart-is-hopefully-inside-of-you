Text: "This story is almost a clich\xEA though very honest. Deciding on a very unusual\
  \ destiny to travel is very exciting, especially when the destinations government\
  \ had just recently opened up to tourism, having been mostly a place for spiritual\
  \ retreat. Buthan is considered the happiest place on earth. Its inhabitants are\
  \ on the top of the list of satisfied citizens alive. That is not exactly hard to\
  \ understand. With its millennia culture and traditions, great relationship with\
  \ nature, food, emotional and mental health, I was more than happy to experience\
  \ all of that.\nFor a good amount of years now, the West has been in touch with\
  \ ancient East philosophy. We had experienced the greats of meditation and body\
  \ moviment practices. We diligent exchange our cup of coffee over tea and many of\
  \ us had already set alarms on our phones to supervise the use of Apps. While many\
  \ on the West are still on a journey to acquaint happiness, some across the World\
  \ seemed to be already living it.\nNow, that's the clich\xEA part was talking about.\
  \ Don't we already know all this? While talking to close friends can be very relieving,\
  \ when I go out on the streets, I still feel people are just trapt in the consuming-entertainment\
  \ never-ending cycle. And that bothers me a lot. While not everyone has the chance\
  \ to retreat in South Asia, it is my task to bring it to them - whatever that means\
  \ - to be able to bring out to people living proof that what they greed for is something\
  \ that's already on the inside.\nButhan is a 46 thousand square kilometers area\
  \ between China and India. Situated in a high altitude site, its lowest point located\
  \ at 318 ft. Besides the fresh air, happiness is taken very seriously here as mentioned\
  \ above. the Gross National Happiness (GNH) is a term that came up in the 1970s\
  \ claiming that the happiness of a nation was more important than the Gross National\
  \ Product. Ever since, life quality measures were up front in development, something\
  \ our capitalism culture simply just struggles to deal with. \nHad finally arranged\
  \ my arrival date and stay directly with Buthan\xB4s National Travel Agency, I've\
  \ been explained that the money spent in Visa and even in Airfare goes directly\
  \ to the maintence of the infrastructure of the country. Their kindness in taking\
  \ care of all details for you is respectful and makes you whant to give it back\
  \ a hundred times! There\xB4re different programs of residency. You can stay in\
  \ a hotel, a monastery, or even in colleges if for study porpuses. There's definitely\
  \ a package suited for all kinds of os person. And they will welcome you warmly\
  \ no matter what season you\xB4re there.\nTo be able to experience another culture\
  \ is, at last, a reason to portrait the exotic. We compound a vast lifestyle society\
  \ and the reason is so we can learn from each other. While the industry has improved\
  \ our productivity by supplying us with tools and gadgets to get the job done, it\
  \ is time we reevaluate this tiering habit of just consuming.\nPeople caught up\
  \ in the illusion of existence were taught that the purpose of life lies in surrounding\
  \ ourselves in furnitured rooms and then you own all you need and you call it a\
  \ home.\nSpending some time in one of Asia's most untouched places gave me an opportunity\
  \ to breathe for the first time outside my own walls. It was a different feeling\
  \ of excitement I've never felt in any other place. A sense of tranquility and peace\
  \ reigns inside and outside the historical buildings mixed with 0% monotony. People\
  \ dance, they make art, they do sports, they work, they are very grateful for caring\
  \ on centuries of tradition and be able to show the world that happiness is something\
  \ we develop on the inside, that besides the walls we\xB4re in, home is a place\
  \ everyone carries deep in - and it got very little to do with how it looks and\
  \ where you are."
