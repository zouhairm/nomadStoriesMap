Text: "The Meaning of Life, Part II: Growth and Learning\n\n\tWith the growing feeling\
  \ that I was in a Monty Python skit, I determinedly kept my head forward, facing\
  \ the opposite rows of pews.  My mouth was clamped shut to stifle the sniggers that\
  \ were building dangerously.  I was afraid that, if I paid too close attention,\
  \ I would discover that John Cleese took his script directly from Oxford\u2019s\
  \ Remembrance Day mass and lose it entirely.  The thought made me wince as the male\
  \ choir member chanting a solo hit a note worthy of an operatic soprano.\n\n\tThe\
  \ college\u2019s chaplain was sitting across from me in the uncomfortable chapel\
  \ setup that abandoned the altar entirely to mingle parishioners, choir, and orators\
  \ alike in narrow benches.  We faced each other as though for debate.  I had attended\
  \ mass at Hertford College before and been unsurprised by its casual atmosphere.\
  \  England, being Anglican, was rooted more in tradition than faith, and the services\
  \ conducted around worshipping the monarchy as holy reflected that.  Henry VIII\
  \ (six wives not included) must slumber peacefully in his grave knowing that he\
  \ stamped this protocol into British history.  \n\n\tBut Remembrance Day brought\
  \ a new level of pomp and circumstance to the medieval chapel.  There were bellowing\
  \ speeches to give and intricate memorial stones to festoon and the iconic poppies\
  \ to bestow.  Part of me was impressed; America\u2019s acknowledgment of Veterans\u2019\
  \ Day paled in comparison to the united recognition that England put on.  But another\
  \ part of me was disillusioned.  My parents were visiting me at Oxford for the first\
  \ time, and I fretted that I had taken them to a ridiculous showing of stiff tradition\
  \ rather than a homey service from my college\u2019s chapel.  \n\n\tThe growing\
  \ sense began when the chaplain paraded in wreaths of poppies to lay on the unused\
  \ altar, heightened when an Oxford alum pontificated solely on the \u201Cstunning\
  \ loss of intelligent, academic minds\u201D in WWI, and reached its peak when the\
  \ male choir member\u2019s solo had threatened to shatter the stained-glass windows.\
  \  I felt my own culture betraying me as I followed the mass along with a sinking\
  \ heart.  All I could hear was religious indifference, classism, and a tradition\
  \ rooted in empty spectacle.  My sense of American pride and independence was rearing\
  \ its ugly head as I stood in the pew, trying to stifle the feeling and return to\
  \ blending in as an Oxford student.\n\n\tA familiar tune started from the organ,\
  \ and I clung to the notes like a lifeline.  At last, a hymn that I knew, here to\
  \ save me from this internal conflict.  I opened my mouth and heard myself sing\
  \ without hesitation, \u201CMy country, \u2019tis of thee!\u201D  \n\n\tMeanwhile,\
  \ the Oxfordians proudly drowned me out: \u201CGod, save our gracious Queen!\u201D\
  \ \n\n\tMy jaw stayed open rather than going into any line about a sweet land of\
  \ liberty.  The high-pitched male choir member triumphantly trilled a demand to\
  \ long live, their noble Queen.  I could not help it this time; I turned to my parents\
  \ to see my disbelief reflected in the growing hilarity on their faces.  Of course,\
  \ I could see us all realizing, early Americans had rewritten the British national\
  \ anthem and turned it into a song lauding a newly-independent country.  Naturally,\
  \ Americans took the tradition they came from and completely bastardized it.  We\
  \ all slowly cracked smiles, privy to some cross-cultural joke.  \n\n\tHow tongue-in-cheek.\
  \  Monty Python would be proud."
