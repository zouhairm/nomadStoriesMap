Text: "In my short life, I have had a few remarkable adventures, but there is a specific\
  \ one that I cherish in my heart, because I thought I wouldn\u2019t make it.\nI\
  \ should bring out that I\u2019m not the sporty type. But my head likes to fly and\
  \ dream, and when I had the chance to go on my own adventure, I just couldn\u2019\
  t refuse.\nWe use to have school trips, and that year, they would take us to climb\
  \ the highest hill there is in Buenos Aires province. I recall thinking that maybe\
  \ I wasn\u2019t prepared for it, but it lured me in; my heart bumped in emotion\
  \ just imagining what it would feel to be in the top of the world. So, I signed\
  \ in.\nIt\u2019s funny because, in the moment we arrived, things started to go wrong.\
  \ It was pouring, so the road to the place we were going to stay was muddy and dangerous,\
  \ so we had to change vehicle (and all our bags) under the rain. When we get there,\
  \ all wet and tired, it turns out we were short of food and cutlery. And, with the\
  \ storm, the mountain signals were all messed up. Therefore, it wasn\u2019t the\
  \ greatest idea to go climbing by ourselves. Luckily, we didn\u2019t panic easily;\
  \ looking at things with amusement, in a bit we solved things out. Everyone ate\
  \ a properly amount of food and we hired two guides to take us to the hill. \nThe\
  \ next morning, we prepared everything we had to take and started our adventure.\
  \ The first stretch was a long walk through the fields; it was a sunny day, and\
  \ we were all in a great mood. The view around us was amazing: green land, blue\
  \ clear sky, and at the end of the path, the hill. It was big enough to scare a\
  \ beginner like me, and it looked further and further as we advanced. But I enjoyed\
  \ the way, smiling and trying not to complain about my heavy backpack. \nI was already\
  \ tired by the time we got to the bottom of the mountain, so I might say that it\
  \ was the hardest part for me, just looking up and contemplate everything that I\
  \ would have to climb for the next couple of hours. \nIt was awful. My feet hurt,\
  \ I had backache, and all I wanted was to sit down and die. When we stopped for\
  \ lunch, I considered just lay there and never standing up again. But there was\
  \ something that pushed me forward: looking back and watching everything that I\
  \ had already covered. I felt proud of myself and thought: \u201CYou made it this\
  \ far, you can\u2019t quit now. Let\u2019s go till the end\u201D.\nEventually, with\
  \ me obviously in last place, we arrived to the cave where we were sleeping, left\
  \ our things, and a few ones stayed there. They were too exhausted to go on. So\
  \ was I, but I was there and I would have regretted it if I didn\u2019t try to get\
  \ to the very top.\nAs the day went by, and it was getting darker, the warm weather\
  \ also started to decrease. The wind was howling with such intensity that it managed\
  \ to blow me. That\u2019s when I started to consider that I may have not taking\
  \ the right decision, but I couldn\u2019t turn back. Just a little bit more.\nTired,\
  \ with my whole body hurting, and trying to no get blown away by the wind (which\
  \ was the most difficult part), I made it. I got to the top of the hill. And the\
  \ view was incredible: you could see the fields all the way to the horizon, and\
  \ a couple of small towns from up there, with the lights starting to turn on. The\
  \ clouds were low and the sun was getting down, which gave to the situation a magic\
  \ aura. I sat there, in the cold stone, and admire the landscape with a big smile\
  \ on my face. Despite the pain, and the effort, I was surprisingly happy, because\
  \ I didn\u2019t give up. And I intend not to do it ever again."
