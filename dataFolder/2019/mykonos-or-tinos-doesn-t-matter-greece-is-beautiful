  \ we walked around to no avail.\nWe approached an old Greek man and asked: \u201C\
  Mykonos?\u201D He replied: \u201COxi, Tinos.\u201D\nWe. messed. up.\nWhat do we\
  \ do? Thank God for Greek police officers! They were SO helpful. They sent us to\
  \ a nearby travel office and we were told to take the night ferry to Mykonos. Okay,\
  \ so what do we do for the afternoon? Food! We went to Palaia Pallada and had the\
  \ BEST, most authentic Greek food with the sweetest waiters! We then visited Panagia\
  \ of Tinos. Time to go! But wait, they wouldn\u2019t let us on the ferry because\
