Text: "On November 20th I was busy listening to my teacher when cellphone buzzed.\
  \ I was startled to see my uncle's name flashing on my screen. I received the call.\n\
  \"Our flight is on 22nd November. \" \nWhat? A joyous smile played on my lips.\n\
  So the day arrived my heart leapt up and down with departure of our plane.Finally,my\
  \ quest of finding my identity, the confusion of my faith, the bewilderment of conventional\
  \ norms will unleash infront of me. \nSaudia Arabia here I come. \nI was paired\
  \ with my younger sister and my uncle's family to fly down to Saudia Arabia. \n\
  We reached at the airport which was freezing cold due to those giant air conditioners\
  \ which were faking the natural weather outside. \nAnyway,  we landed on the city\
  \ of Mecca which was foreign yet so over whelming. The people dressed in their national\
  \ dresses from white robes to black burqas just like 90s black and white TV. We\
  \ stood loud and colorful in a crowd full of blacks and whites. \nWe unpacked our\
  \ bags and headed towards Holy city of Mecca,\"Kaaba.\"\nWe entered into Masjid\
  \ Haram. A rush of adrenaline ran through my body.I felt my palms turning cold.\
  \ \nThe day has arrived my conscience said. \nMy pace gradually sped up with inevitable\
  \ energy to crush all obstacles in between. \nLook up , my uncle said\nOh the beautiful\
  \ kaaba\n Beauty wrapped in black\nLike a deliacte piece of pearl \nA site so unspoken\
  \ yet most spoken \nBreathtaking curtain hiding it's treasure \nA place where words\
  \ are scarce\nMy shoulders dropped down my mouth numbed eyes wet. \nThis is the\
  \ reality .Everyday millions of people around the globe circumambulate around Kaaba.\
  \ \nThere has to be something special.\nWe had a hotel near Masjid where we used\
  \ to reside for our journey of 6days. \nThe hotel room was spick and spank beds\
  \ neatly made just as mom's like, curtain falling down.high ceiling window which\
  \ gave a bird's view of Masjid e haram. We had an Indonesian, Turkish, kaziks and\
  \ many Indians residing in the same corridor. Completely unacquainted about each\
  \ other's culture clueless about our languages. We just passed smiles and some nods\
  \ to communicate. It seemed funny and cute both. \nComing from Pakistan our taste\
  \ buds are accustomed of spice rich foods. Any dish with dangles away from it is\
  \ vapid and pallid. Anyway,here the case was entirely different every dish had a\
  \ mild taste if I place it in a respectable manner. From starter to main course\
  \ every plate brings up a unique flavour with the same tenderness. So,basically\
  \ I and my sister were on a diet throughout the journey. \nAs it is said pros and\
  \ cons go hand in hand. I may not like the food but I became fond of inhabitants\
  \ there.The Arabs were well dressed,well fed and well mannered. No doubt they enjoy\
  \ their hierarchy in world economy. There source of liaison comes directly through\
  \ epiglottis. Khaa,haa etc \nThe Indonesians on the otherhand are quitewell organised\
  \ and forthcoming people.The language which they spoke were syllables hanging in\
  \ air. For a stranger like me this is exactly how it sounds.\n I met an oldman who\
  \ happens to forgot his way. \nVery politely he asked me to help. I guided him over.\
  \ To my surprise I realised he was an Indian. The picture we had in our minds of\
  \ anti Muslims and extremists vanished by his genuine smile. I could see innocence\
  \ sparkling in the old soul. My pilgrimage was completed at that moment. \nA realization\
  \ dawned on me then, No nation in this world depicts a single notion raised by few\
  \ citizens. The loudest in the room is not the representative of entire class.\n\
  This world is a rainbow made of endless diversity. It has a dark and a bright side.Different\
  \ races,ethnicities, caste,color and creed make up VIBGYOR of this rainbow. Each\
  \ and every human contributes to it. So make it healthy and cheerful. \nBecause\
  \ in, diversity there is beauty and strength. \nI did go to pilgrimage but realised\
  \ respecting other soul is the biggest pilgrimage."
