Text: "\u2018What do you mean we\u2019re going to a forest rave on Hong Kong Island?\
  \ Those words don\u2019t add up mate.\u2019\nMatt and I met on the hostel\u2019\
  s rooftop, which in spite of being on the ninth floor was still encased in a loose\
  \ valley of skyscrapers. Causeway Bay sits to the east of Central, a few stops by\
  \ the MTR subway. It feels a bit more local than touristy Central and slick Aberdeen.\
  \ Over here things feel a bit more gritty, with fragrant wet markets tucked down\
  \ alleys and fourth floor cafes overlooking trams rattling down Hennessy Road.\n\
  The rooftop\u2019s where the magic happens. Even before sundown there\u2019ll be\
  \ a couple of people sipping king-cans and chatting about their travels. As night\
  \ falls the benches fill up until there\u2019s a cacophony of twenty or so travellers\
  \ and locals just having a damn good time. Matt\u2019s one of the locals.\nI\u2019\
  d never imagined there were raves in Hong Kong. Honestly I just assumed the government\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be down with kids pumping tunes all night in what is one of the\
  \ most densely populated urban areas in the world. But no, Matt insists, this crew\u2019\
  s been putting on parties for years, they know what they\u2019re doing, best psytrance\
  \ in HK\u2026the fantasy ballooned and I started to sway.\n\u2018Everyyyybodyyyy\u2026\
  who\u2019s down for a boogie?\u2019\nTwenty or so heads look up. Not half an hour\
  \ later a group of fifteen of us step out onto the muggy street, cans in hand, laughter\
  \ all around. We split into groups and four of us cram into a cab, laughing all\
  \ the way as we begin swerving up into the hills.\nWe\u2019re not too sure of our\
  \ goal when we\u2019re dropped off on a seemingly residential street. The towering\
  \ buildings have been replaced with looming mansions, a side of HK I\u2019ve never\
  \ seen before. The coordinates from the private Facebook group are pointing us to\
  \ a patch of green past the end of the street, so on we trek. And all of a sudden,\
  \ boom, we stumble upon something invigorating and grand.\nBeyond a clump of trees\
  \ rises a small concrete amphitheatre, a domed shelter under which has been erected\
  \ a small stage, DJ decks and chunky speakers. A crowd has already formed around\
  \ the slowly rising music. More of the crew rocks up as we go to pay, and before\
  \ we know it the posse\u2019s arrived. \nBeyond the amphitheatre the land slopes\
  \ down to a tree line - narrow steps lead to who know\u2019s what; \u2018the second\
  \ stage.\u2019 I look at Matt.\n\u2018Exsqueeze me?\u2019\n\u2018Yeah, up here\u2019\
  s the psytrance, and down in the bunker they\u2019re playing techno.\u2019\nWe skip\
  \ down the steps like kids at Christmas. The bunker is literally an old lookout\
  \ bunker, a concrete box down near the water. A walled in space in front acts like\
  \ a dance floor, and beyond the sea stretches as far as the eye can see, sprinkled\
  \ with the odd slowly cruising tanker.\nNight creeps on and the music grows louder.\
  \ The crew gets to know each other, as well as the crowd of regulars who kindly\
  \ let us dip our toes into their scene. There\u2019s nothing but good energy to\
  \ be shared. Matt and I climb up onto the concrete roof and sway our hips looking\
  \ out at the small crowd and the sea. A fellow traveller, Melissa, looks up from\
  \ her spot on the concrete wall and waves with a broad smile. We wave back, a moment\
  \ of silent connection and unity across space.\nBefore you know it, the sun begins\
  \ to slowly rise. Most of the crew has made their own way home, and we\u2019re down\
  \ to a group of six. I knew one of these people by name before tonight, yet I have\
  \ a feeling we\u2019ve all formed a bond which will be drawing us back to one another\
  \ for years to come. I never expected to find these experiences in Hong Kong, a\
  \ city which I now realised I\u2019d taken at face value. There are so many more\
  \ facets to this city once you step outside the bustling centre. And the best way\
  \ to explore them all is with new soul mates."
