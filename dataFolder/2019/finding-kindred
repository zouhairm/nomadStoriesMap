Text: "\"Mala\" she called from afar. I met her eyes curiously assuming she had mistaken\
  \ me for someone else, until my doubts were reassured by a gesture to meet her near\
  \ the shore. This was my first visit to Trincomalee, a North-Eastern district in\
  \ Sri Lanka severely affected by the 2004 tsunami. The striking majesty of palm\
  \ trees dancing in melodic breezes, in chorus with the soothing waters of the Indian\
  \ Ocean denied such a history. Walking barefoot on scorching white sand, I delved\
  \ into memory sketching images of possible relatives in Trincomalee, while attempting\
  \ to remember where I had left my flip-flops. \n\nAlongside other women, Vasanthi\
  \ was draping brightly coloured sarongs on a timeworn fisherman\u2019s boat to sell\
  \ to passing tourists. Her large almond-shaped eyes and the curl of her dark hair\
  \ mirrored the features of my cousins in the north. Greeting me with a kiss on each\
  \ cheek, Vasanthi exclaimed to her friends, \"She looks just like Mala!\u201D Nodding\
  \ their heads in response, the local sellers quickly transformed into \u201Caunties\u201D\
  \ asking one question after another before my confusion could be resolved. \u201C\
  Which town are you from?\u201D \u201CTell us about your family.\u201D \u201CHave\
  \ you eaten breakfast?\u201D \u201CWhy are you skinny, do you even eat breakfast?\u201D\
  \ \n\nAmidst the following laughter and chatter, I desperately wanted to know more\
  \ about my look alike. As the others became distracted by tourists considering a\
  \ purchase, I found the opportunity to speak to Vasanthi about Mala. With tears\
  \ welling in her eyes, Vasanthi lamented \u201CMala is my younger sister. She went\
  \ missing during the war.\u201D Holding her hand tenderly, the only words I could\
  \ say were, \u201CI\u2019m sorry.\u201D The calluses of her palms told stories of\
  \ hardship and labour, in contrast to the velvet sand beneath our feet. The Sri\
  \ Lankan civil war which ended in 2009, resulted in the deaths of an estimated 80,000-\
  \ 100,000 people, and 17,000 missing persons. Hearing many accounts of loss and\
  \ tragedy from the armed conflict, I was haunted most by the stories of missing\
  \ persons. The inability to completely grieve for a loved one, paired with a fleeting\
  \ hope for their survival could only amount to mental torture and exhaustion. Like\
  \ many survivors of war, Vasanthi measured her misfortune against others who had\
  \ lost more. Wiping her tears, Vasanti expressed \u201CThe rest of us are alive\
  \ and in good health. I must be grateful for this at least.\u201D \n\nWith noon\
  \ soon approaching, Vasanthi invited me to her home for a traditional Tamil meal.\
  \ I was warmly greeted by her mother, sister, and brother, who quickly shared family\
  \ photos to convince me of my resemblance to Mala. Delicately turning each page\
  \ as if it was fragile glass, I gazed at each photo of Mala desiring to know how\
  \ she felt in every frame. Whether it was our similarity in appearance, culture,\
  \ or homeland, I was overwhelmed with a strange feeling of personal loss. While\
  \ Vasanthi and her sister, Shanthi, prepared lunch they shared stories of Mala\u2019\
  s life- her courage to travel Europe (at a time where few women would), her unyielding\
  \ love for her family, and the joy she brought to her community. Humbled to be immersed\
  \ into a family\u2019s intimate story, I understood that their strength was drawn\
  \ from celebrating Mala\u2019s life, rather than grieving her loss. \n\nLost in\
  \ my own contemplation, I was awoken by the invigorating aromas of coriander and\
  \ cinnamon-spiced curries served before me. Tasting toasted okra soaked in fresh\
  \ coconut milk, and kissed with a touch of turmeric was perfect consolation for\
  \ all the words I could not say. Stopping me in my attempt to express my gratitude,\
  \ Vasanthi said \"Your presence has brought so much joy to our home, as if Mala\
  \ had returned home for a day.\" Beyond the swaying palm trees and shell-spotted\
  \ shores, my memories of Trincomalee will be painted through the faces of Mala and\
  \ her family. Departing with a heartfelt goodbye, I understood that a mere \"thank\
  \ you\" could not suffice for the learning and love I received by a kind stranger\
  \ who recognized me as kindred"
