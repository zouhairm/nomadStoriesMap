Text: "A feeling of lax that rapidly transformed. That was the change in energy when\
  \ the first draft hit me on arrival in Zanzibar from South Africa. Instead of air\
  \ impregnated with the scent and taste of salt and fish, as I had come to expect\
  \ from African coastal cities and Islands, I was greeted with bland heat, humidity,\
  \ and the masses. It was flagrant, I had not just left home to refuel my spirit,\
  \ I had enlisted in the unfamiliar. But, all these factors quickly dissipated as\
  \ I put my \u201CI belong here\u201D face in efforts to locate my friends Anja and\
  \ Yasmine through converging crowds and alleys of Stone Town. The notion of personal\
  \ space would remain a myth until further notice; even the heat knew no bounds.\n\
  \nAfter maneuvering through the distinct Stone Town high walls with remnants of\
  \ expired bullet holes and the narrow inner streets thriving with \u2018Sawa Sawa\u2019\
  \ salutations, we ventured for about two hours along uneven dusty roads and through\
  \ what resembled jungle like forage to Nungwi Beach. Expectations for crystal clear\
  \ water were met on arrival, and contrary to grey and brown Stone Town, Nungwi had\
  \ a wealth of colour from a menagerie of nature and the Maasai. I know what you\u2019\
  re wondering, and yes, the very Maasai warriors associated with living in arid land,\
  \ also populate the soaked beach of Nungwi. I rendered myself open to even more\
  \ of the unknown.\n\nAs an Island of m\xE9lange where East meets West and Arab meets\
  \ African, the Maasai of Zanzibar, informally called \u201CBeach Maasai\u201D leave\
  \ Arusha to participate in what one of the Maasai called \u201Cthe wheel of capitalism\u201D\
  \ to gain money to fulfill their traditional practices. It had been our third day\
  \ in Nungwi, we were along the beach under an umbrella big enough for six, hidden\
  \ from the unforgiving sun with four Maasai engaged in conversations about our respective\
  \ homes.\n\u201CWhat is Arusha like?\" I asked. \n\u201CIt is beautiful, very open\
  \ and hot. Hotter than here and no Ocean, but after six months some of us will go\
  \ back\u201D Isaya said\n\u201CWhy do you leave home for so long?\u201D I followed\
  \ up, and after a few mumbles, \u201Cthe wheel of capitalism\u201D phrase was spoken\
  \ nonchalantly.\nI paused, then chuckled as I couldn't help but wonder if that was\
  \ a phrase he had heard from a previous exchanged with a tourist or just a result\
  \ of his own thinking from increased exposure to tourists. Either way, hearing it\
  \ put a smile on my face and expanded the lens with which I viewed him. \n\nIsaya\
  \ was the shortest of the Maasai we befriended, but he had the aura of the leader\
  \ among them.  He was obstinate and brave with a gravity-defying curly Afro. He\
  \ was garbed in bright red patterned traditional cloth held up by a leather belt\
  \ with a knife and knobkerrie latched on the side. He also ported green-framed plastic\
  \ sunglasses for that touch of modernity and fashion, topped off with shoes made\
  \ from a recycled tyre, which I thought the coolest of his pieces. \nHe would go\
  \ on to describe his desire for enforcement regarding female genital mutilation\
  \ and his wish to see the world.\nHe became like a protector for the remainder of\
  \ our time in Nungwi. As days passed the awareness of the fleeting nature of our\
  \ encounter grew and he would later gift us with bracelets.\n\u201CYou remind me\
  \ of my sister,\" he said to me, \u201Cand I am so happy to gift this because my\
  \ heart feels happy.\u201D He paused, and then, with certainty he concluded, \u201C\
  I know we will not see each other again\u201D. \nI could only smile and embrace\
  \ him.\nAs the taxi pulled out of Nungwi, I began to feel a sinking wave of sadness.\
  \ I was leaving. I knew the ebb and flow of my life would continue, but it would\
  \ never be the same. An unexpected connection with a local deepened my connection\
  \ to the space, even if for a short span. \nI never quite got over the heat, and\
  \ the humidity never subsided, but I found a new association to African coastal\
  \ cities and Islands."
