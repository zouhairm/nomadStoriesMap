Text: "From waking up with a river view as a child, to finding imagination in the\
  \ woods as a pre teen, then exploring the rocky mountains in the Colorado atmosphere\
  \ as a young adult, to exploring every nook and cranny of the hills and beaches\
  \ in New Zealand; the life for me has never been one to settle back in one location.\
  \ \nIve always had a passion as a photographer, to capture what others haven't.\
  \ To create what others might not see that i do. To prove to the rest of the world,\
  \ that theres beauty in everything, theres more to what their life presents and\
  \ offers, and with a little visualization- to bring them out into the physical world\
  \ itself and escape the box they may live in.\nI've been living in a van in New\
  \ Zealand currently for 4 months. To live and breath the outdoor air 95% of your\
  \ day is so refreshing for my mind and body. The van life brings you back to how\
  \ people lived in the past, with less; with only the essentials because that's all\
  \ you need. When you have less, you take more risks, because you have less to lose.\
  \ Therefore, i take many leaps into the unknown and more times than not, come out\
  \ healthier and wealthier mentally and physically then not."
