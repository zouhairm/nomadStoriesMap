Text: "Here I was. In a foreign country I knew nothing or heard anything about.  My\
  \ host in Podgorica, Drale, dropped me off somewhere so that I could hitchhike to\
  \ Budva. I was reluctant to hitchhike as I knew nothing about the country and how\
  \ safe it was to hitchhike alone there. But I had no choice that time as he just\
  \ dropped me off somewhere in Podgorica and after saying goodbye, we parted our\
  \ ways. Drale reassured me that it is safe to hitchhike in Montenegro before he\
  \ drove off.\n\nThere were three others in front of me who were trying to hitchhike\
  \ when I arrived. I was not confident that I was able to get a ride that day. I\
  \ stuck my thumb out anyway as it was a universal gesture for hitchhiking.  After\
  \ 20 minutes, I started to give up. Nobody stopped for us.  But the heat and the\
  \ scorching sun made me more determine that I had to get a ride no matter what.\
  \ So I stuck my thumb out again and after five minutes a black Mercedes pulled over\
  \ and he told me he was heading to Budva and asked me if I was heading that way.\
  \ I quickly ran and grabbed my backpack and hopped into his car. The other three\
  \ hitchhikers who were there earlier were still there.  \n\nI was lucky.\n\nThat\
  \ was how I met the friendly Montenegrin, Dave. As I entered his car, my heart was\
  \ beating so fast.  I was really worried if I made the right decision to hitchhike\
  \ alone in Montenegro. We broke the ice by introducing ourselves and my worried\
  \ thoughts slowly diminished as we talked. He was surprised to learn that I was\
  \ backpacking alone in Eastern Europe as he told me that he had not seen or met\
  \ any Asian hitchhiking and backpacking in Montenegro. I told Dave curiosity brought\
  \ me there and the less I know about a country, the more I would discover.\n\nWe\
  \ spent a good hour chatting and sharing our different cultures while enjoying the\
  \ breathtaking picturesque view along the journey to Budva. Dave grew up in Podgorica\
  \ but left to Switzerland 10 years ago for better opportunity. He talked with pride\
  \ on how Montenegro thrived before the complicated breakup of Yugoslavia and how\
  \ things have changed.  \n\nWe were so swayed away with the conversation for the\
  \ first 40 minutes before he discovered that he forgot to fill his car with petrol.\
  \ \n\n\u201CDamn! My gas tank is empty!\n\n I was supposed to fill up the gas after\
  \ picking you up, but we were so busy chatting that I completely forgot about it!\u201D\
  \ Dave continued.\n\nBoth of us laughed for a moment knowing what trouble we were\
  \ about to get into.\n\nWe were luckily to be able to find a gas station after 10\
  \ minutes drive.\n\nDave dropped me off at the bus station and we took a selfie\
  \ as a remembrance before we say goodbye. He said he could not wait to return and\
  \  shared our stories with his wife and kids. And I told him I could not wait to\
  \ tell everyone about the friendly chap I met in Podgorica and the hospitality I\
  \ received in Montenegro. \n\nI arrived Budva painting the town red with a very\
  \ happy and content heart. \n\nThis is just the beginning of my amazing journey\
  \ in discovering Montenegro and it's people. And how I Iearn to trust people again."
