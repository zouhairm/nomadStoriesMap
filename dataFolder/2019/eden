Text: "Eden\n\tIn 2015, I found Eden. Tucked away in the south of England, in a corner\
  \ of Cornwall, was Tintagel. \n\tHome to Merlin's Cave and the castle where Arthur\
  \ was said to be born, magic, in a way that I had never felt before, surrounded\
  \ the place. Maybe it was something in the air. I certainly felt lighter. Dizzy,\
  \ almost, as I looked around at this place that seemed as if time had stopped. As\
  \ if anything could happen. \n\tTintagel is near the shore, and every night I'd\
  \ look out my window to see the ocean, and the sunrises and the sunsets. And some\
  \ times, I'd make my way down to the beach, down a steep hill that made my legs\
  \ ache and made me yearn for a walking stick. But still, I'd marvel at flora and\
  \ fauna along the way, which seemed so wild, and yet, like it had been painted from\
  \ The Complete Book of Fairies.\n\tEverything was more vivid here. But I remember\
  \ the walk along the cliffs, with the sea view, the most. I was the only person\
  \ around. The trail was full of ups and downs and twists and turns, and the most\
  \ beautiful yellow flowers, which I later learned that the locals regarded as weeds\
  \ \u2013 thistles. They stuck at the clothes if you got too close. I chose that\
  \ day to wear flats. Not my best choice, and every once in a while, my shoe would\
  \ come off, or I would stumble, madly, though the trail. \n\tThe beaches were nice,\
  \ though not so quiet, they still had that aura of peace, and magic. On the way\
  \ back, though, I reveled in the silence, as I picked my way nervously through a\
  \ pasture. Had I come this way before? \n\tBut I also enjoyed the exploration. One\
  \ day, I took my camera up and walked along a different set of cliffs. I had to\
  \ shout over the wind and my hair was blown wildly across my face. But even the\
  \ video couldn't capture all the majesty of the place. The magic. It couldn't show\
  \ how green the grass was, how yellow the flowers, or how blue the sea. It couldn't\
  \ capture that feeling of being alive. \n\tThe town too, seemed like it was caught\
  \ in time, and they served delicious things like Cornish Pasties, which are delicious\
  \ stew like foods, trapped in a croissant like casing. They are pure delicacy. The\
  \ restaurant which I went to the next day was delicious too, and even more peaceful.\
  \ But awkward too, for though the pasta was hot, and delicious, I was the sole dinner\
  \ in this strange place, and I watched as the sun went down from the window, tinging\
  \ everything with a warm red orange light. \n\tAnd that was just it, everything\
  \ was tremendously vivid. The white comforter on the bed, the sounds of the ocean,\
  \ the blue candy which I tried, and tremendously enjoyed, that I have not found\
  \ since. \n\tBut most vivid of all, was the castle itself, which sat atop a high\
  \ hill, a mountain of its own, really, that proudly lie separate from the mainland.\
  \ It dared people to come and find it, to seek out its ruins and take what meaning\
  \ of them it may. \n\tAnd so, with my heart pounding, I climbed the stairs that\
  \ wound around the cliff side. Up, and up, into the sky as the sea shone out beneath\
  \ me, along with some very sharp rocks. Up and up, I climbed, over Merlin's Cave,\
  \ which despite the name, was quite of the ordinary sort, higher and higher, until\
  \ I could see the waterfall that cascaded down into the beach, until finally I reached\
  \ the top. \n\tThe ruins were spectacular. They were very much the skeletons of\
  \ the castle, higher than my head, with some archways remaining.\n\tBut it wasn't\
  \ just the archways that threw me. It was the island itself, which seemed to pulsate\
  \ with history and mystic energy combined. It's a strange thing to say, mystic energy,\
  \ but if you ever go there, I swear you will feel the same thing. A kind of magic\
  \ that is unquantifiable. Something beyond words. In other words, a true Eden."
