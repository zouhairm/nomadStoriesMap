Text: "Whether you travel abroad or drive ten minutes, making connections with people\
  \ who share your passion is truly something that makes life worth living.\n\nIt\
  \ happened for me during a random scroll through Facebook. Having worked previously\
  \ with a talented actor from Ottawa, I decided to peruse a few posts from a group\
  \ located there. Out popped a photo of blue alien with long spikes protruding from\
  \ the back of her hairless skull, followed by a realistic bruised and lacerated\
  \ face. Curiosity demanded more information, so I checked out the profile, expecting\
  \ at least a four hour drive if I ever wanted to meet this talented woman.\n\nHer\
  \ name was Naomi and my jaw dropped to discover she was a mere ten minutes from\
  \ my house in Kawartha Lakes. Without a second thought, I was tapping out a message\
  \ via Facebook asking if we could connect in person, as her work was an absolute\
  \ inspiration.  The message was much longer and less concise than that, as I tended\
  \ to gush like a giddy school girl meeting her teen idol, but the point was made\
  \ and she was delighted to meet a fellow filmmaker.\n\nThree weeks later, I stepped\
  \ from a cold blustery winter day into another world.\n\nA frighteningly accurate\
  \ bust of Hellraiser\u2019s Pinhead greeted me, resting comfortably on a shelf above\
  \ an emaciated skeleton wearing a dirty torn brown jacket. Shelves of molds and\
  \ castings covered the entire right wall, while another shelf was home to an assortment\
  \ of severed limbs and several sharp edged implements.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019re all\
  \ silicone,\u201D she laughs, picking up a bloodied axe and making it flop around\
  \ in her hands.\n\n My gaze swept over a huge eight-foot square table, surrounded\
  \ by chairs, strewn with makeup brushes, colour palettes, prefabricated latex wounds,\
  \ and an assortment of bottles containing fake bloods and sealants.\n\n\u201CI haven\u2019\
  t cleaned up since my workshop on the weekend,\u201D she apologizes.\n\nWe chatted\
  \ for hours. Rhonda showing me some unreleased clips of her recent projects, while\
  \ I talked about the short films I had in the works. We had much in common, besides\
  \ our love of film. Both married. Both moms. And we were both surprised we lived\
  \ so close to each other and had not connected before that day. A travesty if there\
  \ ever was one.\n\nSince then, I have had the pleasure to visit Rhonda\u2019s studio\
  \ on several occasions, and every time I feel as though I\u2019m becoming part of\
  \ a beautiful (and creepy) filmmaking world. It\u2019s a magical experience I thought\
  \ I\u2019d have to travel to another country to find. What a delight to discover\
  \ it right around the corner from my own home."
