Text: "Hands up who wouldn\u2019t have done it in my place. To go back years later,\
  \ to that sloping side road, in that peaceful suburb, in the large and vibrant Scottish\
  \ city, where years ago everything had happened. And not to want to reach the place\
  \ where you had spent grey but amazing days, to ring the bell and see if your former\
  \ landlady still lived there. \n\nOn my day back in Glasgow, I didn\u2019t think\
  \ twice. I pressed the intercom and waited but no one replied. I was about to leave\
  \ when a young blond woman came out of the building and left the main door half-open.\
  \ I decided to enter, went up the dusty stairs and reached the top floor. Everything\
  \ appeared as it had been, except for a showy yellow-black for sale sign on the\
  \ flat door. I tried to ring the bell but nobody was home. I then rang at the next-door\
  \ neighbour\u2019s flat as Louise, my former landlady, had got along well with her.\
  \ \n\n<< Louise? She\u2019s gone. She went on a gap year to Asia and then decided\
  \ not to come back. The flat is now for sale, and I guess the movers will come to\
  \ take her stuff soon.>> \n<<Her stuff?>> \n<<Yes, she wants to move everything\
  \ to her new property in Hong Kong. She\u2019s asked me to keep an eye on the flat\
  \ while it\u2019s empty.>> \n\nEmpty, empty, empty. This one single word rang in\
  \ my head. I was such an insecure, shy, and introverted 28 year-old guy that I would\
  \ never break the rules. That day, however, the mysterious energy which radiated\
  \ from Louise\u2019s flat drove me to it. When my shoes moved Louise\u2019s carpet\
  \ somewhat to the right, I found, as hoped, the spare key to the flat. I slipped\
  \ it into the lock and sneaked into the flat. It didn\u2019t seem possible to me\
  \ to be there and see those light pastel rooms again. The tiled bathroom, the small\
  \ square bedroom, the airy living room, the fully-equipped kitchen, and finally\
  \ the large curtained bedroom to the right. As I was creeping along the narrow and\
  \ long corridor, my ears recognized the familiar noise of walking on the old parquet\
  \ floor. \n\nLouise never used to leave her dearest items unattended. For this reason,\
  \ when I set foot in her room and glanced at the wooden desk, I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find our diary. Stephanie and I had given it to her as a souvenir of the unforgettable\
  \ moments we had lived there together during the Erasmus mobility period. Day by\
  \ day, we two had depicted ourselves and the corners of our own life into diary\
  \ entries, on the promise that each would never have read what the other wrote.\
  \ A cathartic habit born and bred as a game, and like all games, ended up being\
  \ such a powerful seed to make its players grow. I felt all those diary pages could\
  \ come back to living in a new shape. I, therefore, decided, before leaving the\
  \ flat and putting the spare key under the carpet, to take the diary away with me.\
  \ \n\nOnce I got out, I strode along the busy Duke Street on the way to the city\
  \ centre. It was before 5 p.m. and the classical music concert for which I had come\
  \ back there would have begun in no later than three hours. I then decided to spend\
  \ that time downtown, ambling along wide roads, street performers, friendly Glaswegians,\
  \ Scottish bagpipes, and my nostalgic memories. That windy spring day it wasn\u2019\
  t raining and the sky was not as cloudy as usual for the season, but it came to\
  \ my mind that living in Glasgow was like living a life in black and white. There\
  \ were colours but they had to be brought in by people. I didn\u2019t know yet how\
  \ and when I would do that, but I was aware that sooner or later that diary would\
  \ turn out to be a formidable set of colours. I believed, after all, travelling\
  \ and writing accounted for the colours human beings have at their disposal to make\
  \ life\u2019s tones brighter."
