Text: "It was just a little hopeless Idea presenting how can we take a good vacancy\
  \ after a long studies semester, until it become reality !\nJust as my three other\
  \ friends (in same age and education level and social situation) , I always have\
  \ the idea of travelling and live a new adeventure without my familly, just to know\
  \ how much I can count on myself and to explore more this fantastic world \"Life\
  \ is a book, you should travel to explore it\" .\nWe started from our hometown Guelmim,\
  \ taking the road to unknown, and promising ourselves to manage a good journey passing\
  \ by big cities with only few money and fees.\nLeading to Agadir, we had a good\
  \ dinner and only 2 hours in the city until we keep the travel to Rabat, we had\
  \ some selfies together and a quick half-hour walk just before we take the bus to\
  \ the next destination .\nIt's 11:25 Am, we almost slept some hours while we were\
  \ on road, and then we arrived to Rabat, the capital ! \nMr.Lahcen was waiting us\
  \ in the bus station, they took us to have some rest after 10 hours of road, the\
  \ atmosphere was fantastic, hiden sun and a spirituell winter springs .\n15:00 pm,\
  \ we were ready to have another long walk this time, to discover the capital for\
  \ the first time ! We took the Tramway to 11 November yard,it was so quiet inside\
  \ the  transport machine, we've arrived to the destiny, the beautiful large yard\
  \ with too much details to observe ! \nWe took some memories photos there and then\
  \ marched to Hassan II Tower, the famous historical high tower, we found some friends\
  \ there from the hometown, as they took a good 15 days vacancy to get ready for\
  \ the second semester .\nwe went after to the Mohamed V's shrine just next to the\
  \ tower, a minute of silence and greeting the royal gards outhere, then we went\
  \ to Qasbat L'Oudaya, this fanrastic Qasba with beautiful arichitecture symbols,\
  \ passing by courniche and get a Boat ride To Sal\xE9 (the city on the other side\
  \ by Valley abou raqraq)\nAfter 3 days we took the lead to the north Morocco, Tanger,\
  \ after 5 only hours if road From Rabat, after thanking Mr Lahcen for having us\
  \ and wishing him the best.\nWe arrived by night, go take a rest and wait the next\
  \ day to begin another good walk, and there we go !\nsun is up, we took a quick\
  \ breakfast while we were so excited ! we started the Journey from Dradeb (a famous\
  \ neighbourhood just like a maze) of corse we've been lost there, haha\nwe went\
  \ to the Tanja Courniche and waited For Omar ! my good old friend, we had a morning\
  \  walk together and discussing to much things, it was also a good chance for Omar\
  \ to know my other journey friends .\nWe passed by Center Tanger, the Tanger Marina\
  \ bay and other places, and the best is yet to come !\nthe next day, we got Omar\
  \ again in the central Tanger mall, the biggest Mall there with full of fantastic\
  \ merachandises and services, we did the shopping plan, buying some clothes and\
  \ electronics, and we ate Tacos together with too much fun.\nIts time to say Goodbye\
  \ again to Omar due to his personal conditionq, hoping to'see him next time we come\
  \ to Tanger ! \nNext Day we went to Tetouan, an hour road near Tanger, the beautiful\
  \ white city called \"The Dove\" ! we had a good walk there, passing by Royal Palace,\
  \ ElFeddan yard and Al michwar Saiid, those place are so symbloic with too much\
  \ joy and happiness showed !\nIt's time to go back to Tanger, then take the road\
  \ to the hometown (19 hours) after a beuatiful 8 days journey, what an experience\
