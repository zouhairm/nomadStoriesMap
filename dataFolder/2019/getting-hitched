Text: "In 2016, I went on a field trip to the islands of Kiribati to evaluate the\
  \ effects of climate change on the local population. Before the field trip two of\
  \ my friends and I caught up for a week of travel around Nandi, Fiji, which is enroute\
  \ from Sydney, Australia to Tarawa, Kiribati.\n \nBack packing in Fiji, my friends\
  \ and I were exploring Kuala national park, when we realised that we had a strong\
  \ desire to go to Natadola beach because the weather was HOT. Like sweat pooling\
  \ on your back hot. We weren\u2019t far from the beach, so my friend SH tried waving\
  \ down multiple mini-buses with a classic Aussie \u2018thumbs up mate\u2019 but\
  \ none of the buses responded. SH wasn\u2019t quick enough to put his hand down\
  \ before a smaller Ford Falcon pulled over to the side of the road. Surprised and\
  \ a little bit dazed, my other friend JB and I followed SH as he jogged over to\
  \ the car. We reached it and saw a young man and woman with an adorable little girl\
  \ and somehow my fears of what \u2018hitch hiking\u2019 would be like evaporated.\n\
  \nTo give you some back story, I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as the most confident\
  \ person; hitchhiking in Fiji was not something I had really imagined! But here\
  \ we were, chatting about our day to these lovely people who were, funnily enough,\
  \ also making their way to Natadola beach!\n\nThe beach was epic.... long rolling\
  \ sand dunes with crystal clear waters. Some adventurous people were riding horses\
  \ along the beach! We relaxed and chatted more to our hosts.\n\nOur drivers were\
  \ a Fijian-Indian-Muslim couple; also self claimed FBI\u2019s - Fijian Born Indians.\
  \ On the way back from Natadola beach they stopped at their home where four generations\
  \ lived under the one roof. They were sugar cane farmers, a tradition that had been\
  \ passed down from father to son for three generations. The man who picked us up\
  \ was an electrician by trade, and his wife was a nurse. Over afternoon tea, their\
  \ father described to us the situation that they faced in terms of climate. The\
  \ rainy season is meant to begin in November, but this season it held off until\
  \ late January. This is very strange for the sugar cane farmers of Fiji. Already,\
  \ the weather patterns are out of whack, and this is an island paradise that many\
  \ people think will remain constantly perfect forever.\n\nWe then had dinner with\
  \ the couple who picked us up, and talked more about Islamic culture and life as\
  \ a Fijian-Indian. The next day, we spent a morning buying fresh fruits and vegetables\
  \ from the markets, and then we went to the beach in the afternoon. We went snorkelling,\
  \ and gained an even deeper appreciation for the natural beauty of Fiji. We finished\
  \ the day with a splendid vegetarian dinner at the home of our new friends.\n\n\
  This story taught me so much about the spontaneity of travel. In my mind, my travel\
  \ goal was to go to this beach to get a few pictures and say that I had been there.\
  \ But I can say with utter confidence that the best part about this story is the\
  \ people that I met. They are the real gems for this story."
