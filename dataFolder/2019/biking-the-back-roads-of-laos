Text: "As I pedaled toward the village of Pak Ou, my bike jittered over the pebbled\
  \ path and I squeezed the brakes with all my might. The thick tires could endure\
  \ anything, but I had to maneuver around tight curves, never knowing when a minivan\
  \ would hurtle toward me. When vehicles did drive past, they threw billows of dust\
  \ into the air. No wonder everybody wears bandanas here, I thought as I held my\
  \ breath through another yellow cloud.\n\nThen the jungle opened up. There, beyond\
  \ the trees, rose a wall of cliffs. The ridges rolled venerably against the perfect\
  \ blue sky. And at their foot, the espresso-hued Mekong River drifted. I stood there,\
  \ open-mouthed, as insects sang in the glade. I wondered: Is there anywhere as beautiful\
  \ as Laos?\n\nI had come to Laos because of my interest in the Secret War, a nine-year\
  \ aerial bombardment that left millions of unexploded cluster bombs in the Laotian\
  \ countryside. That\u2019s the bad news: Thanks to the CIA, these tennis-ball shaped\
  \ bombs have infected nearly every square mile of Lao soil. Running into them can\
  \ be deadly.\n\nFor years, this landlocked communist nation has played second fiddle\
  \ to Thailand. Now, Laos\u2019 ecotourism industry has exploded. Once-sleepy townships\
  \ like Luang Prabang attract thousands of visitors per year. The village of Vang\
  \ Vieng, nestled beneath breathtaking crags, is an epicenter of touristy pastimes\
  \ like rope swings, hot air balloons and \u201Ctubing\u201D\u2014riding inner tubes\
  \ down the river, cocktail in hand. But Laos is also one of the least developed\
  \ nations in Asia, with 70 percent of its land covered by dense rainforest. Laos\u2019\
  \ many animal preserves and national parks are home to Asian pachyderms, Indo-Chinese\
  \ tigers, marbled cats and the ultra-rare Irrawaddy dolphin, a freshwater species\
  \ that frolics in the Mekong.\n\nFor serious outdoorspeople, Laos is a vast playground\
  \ of guided trekking, mountain biking and backwoods elephant rides. Visitors can\
  \ zip-line through the jungle canopy, kayak the rivers or scale the incomparable\
  \ Laotian cliffs. Most of these activities have emerged in the past few years, and\
  \ trips tend to be environmentally low-impact. And for many Lao citizens, ecotourism\
  \ provides a high-skill alternative to a life hunched over rice paddies.\n\nMeanwhile,\
  \ if Lao entrepreneurs are smart, they\u2019ll avoid Thailand\u2019s mistakes: over-development,\
  \ displacement of indigenous people and commodification of everything in sight.\n\
  \nI rented my bike from Green Discovery Laos, an agency that specializes in adventure\
  \ travel and ecotourism. Founded in 2000, Green Discovery has branches across Laos,\
  \ and visitors can try everything from motorcycle excursions to self-guided caving.\
  \ I asked to rent a decent bicycle. Although Green Discovery doesn\u2019t rent bicycles\
  \ on their own, the agent brokered a rental through a separate company. The bike\
  \ cost $8, a steep price for Laos (guesthouse bikes can be rented for $1 a day).\
  \ But the mountain bike proved to be the best I\u2019d ever ridden.\n\nThe best\
  \ part of trekking in Laos is the people: No matter how far off the beaten track\
  \ you venture, villagers treat guests with the utmost hospitality. Laotians are\
  \ laidback by nature, but they are also generous and good-humored. Street crime\
  \ is almost nonexistent, buses make it easy to get around, and everywhere you go,\
  \ you are greeted with a smile and a \u201CSaabaidee!\u201D\n\nNot everyone is happy\
  \ about the influx of tourists. Laos may be poor and behind the times, but purists\
  \ scowl at farang tromping through fragile villages and ancient temples. Vang Vieng\
  \ has a reputation for psychedelic pizzas and rowdy nightlife, and even the almsgiving\
  \ to Buddhist monks has been commercialized. Of all travelers, ecotourists are by\
  \ far the most welcomed, given their interest in Laos\u2019 natural wonders\u2014\
  woodlands, waterfalls and limitless biodiversity.\n\nWhen I finally coasted into\
  \ Pak Ou, I found a village in transition: Parts had become a tourist trap, with\
  \ requisite rows of souvenir shops and noodle shacks. But Pak Ou was still a functional\
  \ village, where real families lived and worked. And when I reached the riverbank,\
  \ the dramatic Pak Ou cliffs beckoned across the water. Open borders may change\
  \ the face of Laos, but when it comes to the country\u2019s natural treasures, ecotourism\
  \ may also keep them intact."
