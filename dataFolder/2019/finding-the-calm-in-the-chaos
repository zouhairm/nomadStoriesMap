Text: "I arrived in Guatemala with the goal of a calm week to escape from the carnival\
  \ madness occurring in my current home country of Panam\xE1 . I spent my first full\
  \ day in San Marcos, a colorful, tiny town on the edge of the magnetic Lake Atitl\xE1\
  n. After review of the town\u2019s bulletin board of happenings, I chose \u2018\
  Keith\u2019s Original Cacao Ceremony @ Casa Chocolate\u2019. \n\nThere were about\
  \ twenty of us scattered around the porch, drinking our cup of bitter cacao while\
  \ Keith, a proclaimed chocolate shaman, lazily pet his cat and explained the power\
  \ of cacao. \u201CCacao doesn't push you forcefully through a door. Cacao, with\
  \ the right mindset, will put the door in front of you, and then you may decide\
  \ to walk through it or not.\u201D I sipped my drink with a sense of nervousness\
  \ and anticipation.\n\nThroughout the seven hours spent on that porch, my door led\
  \ me to an analysis and reflection of my life. While people around me cried, laughed,\
  \ shared, and even burped uncontrollably, I came to the conclusion that my life\
  \ was in a content place. It was an odd conclusion to have when life typically seems\
  \ full of chaos. Long-haired Keith stayed away from probing me about my inner thoughts,\
  \ and I was grateful. I felt I was lacking in a sense being surrounded by individuals\
  \ who felt the power of transformation and healing.\n\nThe following morning brought\
  \ sounds of the native women washing clothes in the cold lake. I couldn\u2019t see\
  \ them, but I lazily observed the late-comers meandering down the path with one\
  \ hand steadying the baskets on their heads and the other hand guiding barely awake\
  \ children. I rose early to catch a tuk-tuk to begin my hike on the San Pedro volcano.\
  \ My guide was a local of Mayan descent. Before our journey, he began with a prayer\
  \ in the Tz'utujil language, asking for guidance and protection on our path. \n\n\
  He spoke proudly of the Mayan culture while I struggled to keep up behind him. He\
  \ laughed as he discussed his family traditions and he adopted a solemn sense when\
  \ he explained how his people believe the deceased become stars in the sky or assist\
  \ with the movement of the sun. The essence of those passed also become a part of\
  \ their descendants. \n\nThe path grew steeper as we climbed through the coffee\
  \ plantations and we arrived closer to the summit. Brief sections of wooden stairs\
  \ were carved out. I mentioned how it felt as if I was climbing the stairway to\
  \ heaven. \n\nI arrived to the top of the volcano completely breathless. This was\
  \ a result of the arduous work to the top combined with the expansive natural beauty\
  \ that reached around layers of volcanoes and hills. The white clouds spotted the\
  \ light blue sky above the deepest lake in Central America. I was engulfed in the\
  \ feeling of serenity.\n\nAfter six hours of exhausting labor and a few apologies\
  \ to my poor knees, I stumbled into an out of place Irish pub back in town. The\
  \ disconnection from the \u201Creal world\u201D was a dose of medicine for my soul,\
  \ but the millennial in me was itching to connect to the spotty WiFi. When I did,\
  \ my screen was flooded with missed calls and messages. \n\nMy father had died that\
  \ morning. \n\nDeath doesn\u2019t take vacations. My location during his passing\
  \ granted me the chance to rewrite the way society had told me to mourn. It was\
  \ unconventional, like my father. There was no protocol for this situation, so I\
  \ decided to stay. Death was on my brain, but I was observing more of life than\
  \ I ever had. The breeze on my skin, the laughter of children, the spray of the\
  \ water on my face, it all held more intensity than before.\n\nI mourned the loss\
  \ and celebrated his life in the land where the depths of the water and the vastness\
  \ of the skies were limitless. It was the perfect place to find my star in the sky,\
  \ my mover of the sun, and to feel the changes I felt were happening  from within.\
  \ Lake Atitl\xE1n will forever be the place were I both lost and gained."
