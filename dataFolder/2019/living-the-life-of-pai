Text: "I don't know what day of the week it is, I don't know what time it is- and\
  \ I certainly don't know what time it is at home. I'm sitting in a bamboo hut in\
  \ the jungle, painting my nails with a peachy-orange varnish. The new colour symbolises\
  \ a shift in my mood and general outlook on life. It was blue before.\nOnly two\
  \ days ago, I was lying on a bed just a few kilometers from where I am now, quarantined\
  \ by an infested mosquito net. Bites ballooned all over my sun-burned skin and the\
  \ desire to scratch, well, it made my mind snap every hour, on the hour. Crippled\
  \ by a stabbing pain in my right side, I knew that my dreaded food poisoning day\
  \ had finally come- after only a week in South East Asia. \nIn almost every restaurant,\
  \ filthy hands prepare questionable meat as flies casually land whenever they feel\
  \ peckish. I was in one place scoffing Pad Thai while a cockroach was being eaten\
  \ alive by a mound of ants at my feet. Vomit, pain, vomit pain- you can fill in\
  \ the blanks. Let's just say, the old Thai pharmacist gave me a free pack of Oreo's\
  \ because he felt especially sorry for me. I was so ill that a lizard crawled across\
  \ our bedroom wall and I just looked at it, passed out and looked at it again, before\
  \ gargling up the energy to shout 'Chris! Lizard! Wall!'.\nThis whole ordeal happened\
  \ in Pai, a small town on the northern tip of Thailand, smack bang in the epicenter\
  \ of tropical wilderness. To get there, we had to take a three hour taxi from the\
  \ nearest town. The driver swerved along cliff edges for the entire journey as passengers\
  \ were tossed like a caesar salad at every bend. \n'Welcome to Pai' the wooden sign\
  \ eventually read, and within moments an elephant was passing us on the road, as\
  \ if he were just another mode of transport. Crossing the threshold into this tie-dyed\
  \ nook in the jungle was like taking a substantial dose of Valium. Nature envelops\
  \ every make-shift wooden hut and, with every lick of paint and sun drenched bench,\
  \ caf\xE9s promote the art of taking it easy. Magic mushroom milkshakes are always\
  \ on offer and, surprisingly, they taste like lime slushies- or so I've heard. \n\
  I didn't see one newspaper, one clock, not one person rushing to get anywhere. The\
  \ shopkeepers in Pai don't hassle you to buy as they do, ferociously, in Bangkok.\
  \ They have an unspoken policy of 'if they want it they'll buy it'- which, if you\
  \ ask me, should be adopted in every shop in the world. \nWhen we descended the\
  \ bus onto Pai's Walking Street, backpackers were melting outside cafes and open-topped\
  \ raggae bars, locals were stirring pots of spices and I was standing in the middle\
  \ of it all with my mouth on the floor. The energy of Pai had come over me like\
  \ a warm wave. I was considering phoning my mother to tell her I wasn't coming back.\
  \ 'It's just, I've actually found paradise', I was planning on saying.\nThe only\
  \ downside could have happened anywhere in the world. We had rented a scooter (for\
  \ just \u20AC3 a day) and were breezing through the town like the coolest kids imaginable.\
  \ I had a t-shirt on that said 'I love Pai' and helmet strapped to my skull. Just\
  \ as we approached a corner, we saw this black thing twitching on the road. It was\
  \ a cat, whose neck had been rolled over by a car. Blood was squirting like a fountain\
  \ and his legs twitched like a man being hung. He cried out for help and stared\
  \ directly into the eyes of an old Thai lady with a sweeping brush. She watched\
  \ calmly as he thrashed his way to death.\nDespite the cat trauma, I have really\
  \ been living the life of Pai. We were only meant to stay here for three days but\
  \ a week has passed without any mention of us leaving it behind. Unfortunately,\
  \ our schedule dictates that we must depart today and take a slow boat to Laos.\
  \ Whatever a slow boat is."
