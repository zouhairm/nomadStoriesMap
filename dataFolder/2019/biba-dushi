Text: "Recently, I had the pleasure of traveling to Aruba for 7 days and had quite\
  \ a few eye opening experiences that I wanted to share with you! Biba Dushi is a\
  \ popular phrase you'll hear while you're in Aruba and it simply means \u201CLiving\
  \ a sweet life\u201D; I couldn't agree more. The island is full of very friendly,\
  \ helpful, and joyful people that speak five languages by the time they graduate\
  \ from high school. It is not only a beautiful island, but a very safe one to travel\
  \ to. While I was there we went every where by foot or taxi and not once did I feel\
  \ unsafe. The food and the views were exceptional and people were no different.\
  \ \n\nWhile traveling, we had to go through customs for the island and USA and this\
  \ was probably the worst part of the trip. I does take 3 hours to get through the\
  \ airport when leaving- so first tip, make sure you give yourself plenty of travel\
  \ time the day you leave. I recommend to wear comfortable shoes and clothes as well\
  \ because you will be standing for a very long time waiting in line. Don't make\
  \ the mistake of bringing any liquids back in your carryon even if they are sealed\
  \ because they will take it. We lost few gifts to this mistake! \n\nAnother tip\
  \ is your cellphone, make sure you get an international plan while you're away.\
  \ I was told by my carrier that I could use my phone if I was connected to wifi\
  \ and my cellular data was off- so I did and I accrued over $100 in charges from\
  \ my phone roaming etc. Don't make the same mistake and just get the plan, its less\
  \ expensive! I recommend also bringing an external charger any time you travel,\
  \ this has saved me more times that I can tell you and first time I traveled alone\
  \ somewhere, my phone died and I ended up in a not so great situation!  \n\nFrom\
  \ visiting Aruba, I fell in love with photography, I absolutely want to take a class\
  \ and get a nice camera in the future. I have included some of my shots from this\
  \ trip and I honestly couldn't get enough of it and the views never grew old. Every\
  \ morning, I would get up around 7:30am and work out on the beach by jogging and\
  \ the island was pretty asleep still. This is when I got some of my best shots and\
  \ I also got some much needed me time that helped rejuvenate me. I read a book for\
  \ the first time in a long time that wasn't about my career and it was wonderful.\
  \ \n\nWhile I was away, I was able to focus on my thoughts, my goals, and my future;\
  \ it helped me to find myself again and reignite that passion inside of me. I was\
  \ ready to jump back in when I got home from my trip and hit the ground running,\
  \ this was exciting for me, because sometimes you lose your focus or have set backs.\
  \ It\u2019s important to take time for your self and put the energy and focus back\
  \ on you to refuel. And that is one of my final tips. Take time for you!\n\nIf you\
  \ ever get the pleasure of visiting Aruba- Pincho\u2019s was my favorite restaurant,\
  \ it was on the water and the sunset was breathtaking. I went parasailing and was\
  \ able to see Sea Turtles and the views were amazing as well. If you can, take a\
  \ morning excursion to the natural pool in the National Park Arikok. And lastly,\
  \ go into town and experience the local shops, you wont regret it!\n\nAruba had\
  \ this way of helping me get back to my core, and redirect my energy and passion\
  \ for writing. Since I\u2019ve been home, I have had a new appreciation to detail,\
  \ starting writing a novel, and published my first children\u2019s book. Traveling\
  \ is amazing and the things you can experience and learn from other cultures is\
  \ really once in a lifetime."
