Text: "I never thought I would find myself standing feet deep in white sand with blue\
  \ waters ahead of me, and coconut trees swaying behind in the distance. The eight-hour\
  \ bus journey from Bengaluru to Gokarna was worth it. It is a small, quaint seaside\
  \ town away from humdrum of the urban space. A famous sport pilgrimage for many.\n\
  \nI went to Gokarna as unplanned trip with my friends buying my ticket and informing\
  \ me about it a day before. It was pleasant surprise when I stepped off the bus\
  \ and took in the scenery. A small bus stop, where asphalt road stood in stark contrast\
  \ of towering green trees by its sides. Few old brick buildings surrounding the\
  \ area, rickshaws and taxi drivers crowding the area in eager wait for the customers.\
  \ And I stretched my hands, rolled my shoulders and looked up at the sky, it was\
  \ clear blue except the birds in air. It was a beautiful day.\n\nWe made a quick\
  \ journey to farmhouse where we had rented two rooms. It was rather strange to have\
  \ a French family as your neighbors by one side and Kannad family on another. We\
  \ strapped on our helmets and turned the keys of our rented scooters ignition to\
  \ get to our first destination of Kudle Beach which is five kilometers from Gokarna.\
  \ The zig zag roads and array of tall trees, ranging from coconut to wild flowers\
  \ shrubs, had me on terrible highs as cool wind blew through my hair. No traffic,\
  \ no horns just the echo of careless laughter of my friend who overtook me.\n\n\
  We spent our entire first day going to different beaches until we found ourselves\
  \ on Middle beach in the evening. Entire day of sun, salted air and smiles with\
  \ coconut vendors, the beachside seashell jewelers and few boats in the blue waters\
  \ in distance. We had our dinner in funky caf\xE9 with sand beach as its flooring,\
  \ named Chill Out Caf\xE9. A dim lilted space with buzz of conversation flowing\
  \ in too many varied languages I could not pin point, though I did recognize a group\
  \ of Spaniards dressed in over- sized loose colored washed out shirts with beers\
  \ in their hands. The service was slow but food was worth it, there is something\
  \ say about having food on the beach.\n\nAfter our long we walked on the beach aimlessly,\
  \ in no hurry to get back to farmhouse. The sand was lily white and just as soft,\
  \ and the waning moon looked as if it were shell washed ashore from the ocean that\
  \ was the black night. The dark sky made the stars shine so brilliantly, as if someone\
  \ dropped a bottle of sparkles on black canvas. The night so clear and dark that\
  \ I could see the silver wisp threads that connected the stars into constellations\
  \ whose name I couldn\u2019t fathom in the movement. \n\nAnd I stood there reveling\
  \ the mystery of universe as I came to sudden epiphany. I was standing under the\
  \ same stars as Chinese, who six thousand years ago and called the night Yewan,\
  \ stars Xingchen and the moon Weixing.\n\nFive thousand years ago, the Sumerians\
  \ called the night ngi, the stars mul, and the moon Nanna.\n\nFour thousand years\
  \ ago, the indo- aryans called the night ratri, the stars nakshatra, and the moon\
  \ chandrama. \n\nThree thousand years ago, the Hitties called the night musu, the\
  \ stars hasteres, and the moon Arma.\n\nTwo thousand years ago, the Romans called\
  \ the night nox, the stars stellae and the moon Luna.\n\nOne thousand years ago,\
  \ the Norsemen called the night nott, the stars stjarne and the moon Maani.\n\n\
  Kings, queens, knights and heroes have stood under those stars. Merchants, slaves,\
  \ mothers, children who sneaked out of their bed in night, Beethoven, Cleopatra,\
  \ Tansen, Van Gough, Akbar, Wilde have all stood under the same night sky. For centuries\
  \ the stars have been refuge to dreamers and stargazers, creating a family for the\
  \ people who look at the stars to find solace. I found family.\n\nAre you anxious?\
  \ Indo-Aryans called it Trasin. Does your heart ache? The Greeks called it Akhos.\
  \  The starlight has soothed them and may its sooth you."
