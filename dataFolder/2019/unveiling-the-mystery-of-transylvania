Text: "I\u2019m lying on the back seat of my parents Lancia, watching the bright stars\
  \ in the night sky through the window. The moon is really skinny and is changing\
  \ color from orange to red. I have never seen a moon being so low.\n\nWe\u2019re\
  \ spinning on serpentine roads while going up on a mountain ridge, mist is covering\
  \ the ground like a soft blanket. Did someone make this fog on purpose just to tickle\
  \ our nerves? But the fog was real and was forming in the shape of clouds in front\
  \ of the car. I had feeling that we would get lost and end up in Stephen King`s\
  \ Rock and Roll Heaven.\n\nDad turns on Europa FM and all the mystery suddenly fades\
  \ away...\n\nI talked my parents into having this road trip to Transylvania last\
  \ time I was visiting them in Chernivtsy, Ukraine. \n\nThe restaurant by the road\
  \ treats us to tasty bean soup with smoked bacon and hunter sausages along with\
  \ cheese platter. The staff is very friendly. Overall Romanian people left a very\
  \ nice impression on my family. I don\u2019t know why they often get associated\
  \ with gypsies in Europe. I bet they don\u2019t like this stereotype. However, some\
  \ gypsies and magicians are from Romania. There\u2019s even a special term for Carpathian\
  \ magicians who can change the weather \u2013 Molfar.\n\nWe arrived at our small\
  \ cozy hotel in Bran around midnight and it was too dark to see the full sight of\
  \ the mountains. The sky was clearly divided in half: It was half foggy and half\
  \ starry. The Upper Hand probably pained a clear line between the two wonders of\
  \ nature.\n\n``Look, there\u2019s your Milky Way`` mom said, as she pointed her\
  \ finger into the night sky and her tired eyes sparkled.\n \nHello Transylvania,\
  \ the land of the living and the world of Count Dracula. I\u2019m here, I\u2019\
  m yours for the night!\n\nThe city of Bran, Brasov County dates back to the early\
  \ 13th century.\n\nTo get to Dracula\u2019s castle you have to go through an outdoor\
  \ market where you can buy all kinds of Dracula souvenirs and wool clothes. Try\
  \ Blood of the Vampire (fresh pomegranate juice), kebab and hot wine, cheeses and\
  \ sausages for any taste. \n\nThe snow on top of the mountains and fresh autumn\
  \ air are only adding excitement to my current Game of Thrones mood with its castles\
  \ tucked in between snowy mountains.\n\nWe paid an admission fee of 40 Lei per person\
  \ (about 8.5 Euros) and followed the brick road up to the castle. The castle\u2019\
  s architecture is spectacular; it is located on the top of the hill with a breathtaking\
  \ panorama of Carpathian Mountains that spans over the fairy-tale setting of roads\
  \ that lie underneath the hill. It gives a dramatic mood at night. \n\nI have been\
  \ to a number of castles but I have never seen anything like this. The 640 year-old\
  \ castle was breathing with history and had way too many levels and balconies to\
  \ be counted: A secret stair case, a game room for playing cards, a library full\
  \ of Dracula portraits, a display of knives, a torture room and an inner courtyard\
  \ with a well. It also had quite a few tourists from all over the world on this\
  \ windy but sunny November day.\n\nCount Dracula, a fictional character in the Bram\
  \ Stoker`s novel, was inspired by one of the best-known figures of Romanian history.\
  \ Vlad Dracula, nicknamed Vlad Tepes (Romanian for Vlad the Impaler), was a ruler\
  \ of Walachia (nowadays Romania) at various times: 1448, 1456\u20131462, 1476. Vlad\
  \ Tepes adopted the method of impaling criminals and enemies and raising them aloft\
  \ in the town square for all to see. Almost any crime, from lying and stealing to\
  \ killing, could be punished by impalement. \n\nFunny enough the Irish author has\
  \ actually never been to Romania. He did an extensive research in libraries.\n\n\
  This road trip has left no doubt that there is something particularity magical about\
  \ these mountains. Count Dracula and even dragons are believed to be from deep dark\
  \ forests in the ancient Carpathian Mountains.\n\nAre vampires real? We will never\
  \ know the answer however Vlad Dracula was a very real ruler."
