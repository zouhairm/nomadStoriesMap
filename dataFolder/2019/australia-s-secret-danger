Text: "A change; that\u2019s what I was in search of when I booked a one-way flight\
  \ to Australia. It\u2019s probably the main motivation for many travelers. I was\
  \ sick of living in a place so cold that the tips of my hair would freeze, splintering\
  \ off if I wasn\u2019t careful. I was sick of an employer that may as well have\
  \ had a leash around my neck for all the freedom she gave me.\n\nThe land down under\u2026\
  \ I\u2019d heard of its reputation for sunshine and beaches and more importantly,\
  \ a laid back approach to life. People who valued their free time, who didn\u2019\
  t believe work should be the epicenters of their sweet but short lives.\n\nSo I\
  \ booked my ticket. I told myself, I wouldn\u2019t even stay a full year, no. There\u2019\
  s no way I would like it there enough to stay for so long. There\u2019s no way my\
  \ antsy feet would stand still and sink into the sands of beautiful beaches that\
  \ were dotted with palm trees. But, they did.\n\nI found the change I was searching\
  \ for\u2026 people were so much happier. They didn\u2019t take things so seriously\
  \ or work so hard or fret nearly as much. Their wrinkles were only from the sun,\
  \ never from worry lines. I thought it was so perfect, and in many ways, it was.\n\
  \nBut is it possible they were too laid back? Too relaxed about certain things\u2026\
  \ was I still too uptight? But the feeling\u2026 the feeling I had when the owner\
  \ of the caf\xE9 I worked at smacked my behind with a wooden board. I didn\u2019\
  t even feel rage when he laughed because he found it funny. I was so shocked; I\
  \ just looked at him with a blank face, my mouth slightly open in confusion. He\
  \ couldn\u2019t have really just done that could he? Are people so laid back here\
  \ that even harassment is just commonplace?\n\nOh and out on the farms of Tasmania.\
  \ I\u2019d honestly never seen anything so lush. The hills rolled on forever and\
  \ I felt so lucky that my job meant walking through them all day long while building\
  \ fences and taming the weeds that tried to take over the land. The potato farming,\
  \ that was a different story. I\u2019d never found myself so dirty before; the air\
  \ would be filled with dust so I\u2019d come home with a scalp full of dirt and\
  \ nostrils ringed in black grime. Nothing a warm shower couldn\u2019t fix\u2026\
  \ if only we\u2019d had hot water.\n\nMy mom worried about my lungs inhaling all\
  \ that dust but I didn\u2019t fear. I was more worried about the tightness in my\
  \ throat and the stinging of my eyes and the pain in my heart from their words.\n\
  \nIt was dry and brown in the days but the early mornings meant seeing the most\
  \ impressive sunrises I\u2019d see in my life. Splashed across the sky were faded\
  \ pinks and warm oranges that blended together to create real beauty. The rainy\
  \ days meant purple skies with rainbows arcing across the potato fields.\n\nBut\
  \ they were so crude. I\u2019d come in to work at five in the morning, still barely\
  \ awake to be asked how many times I slept with my boyfriend the night before. I\
  \ was told it was written all over my face \u201Cwhat we\u2019d done\u201D and I\
  \ shouldn\u2019t be surprised by the question. I watched as they made fun of my\
  \ Chinese coworker about his culture straight to his face but treated him as if\
  \ he wasn\u2019t capable of understanding even though his English was probably better\
  \ than theirs and his heart was most certainly kinder. \n\nIt\u2019s a place of\
  \ sunshine and happiness and drinking beer out of shoes because, who cares? Everything\
  \ is relaxed and everyone is \u201Cmates\u201D and there\u2019s nothing to worry\
  \ about. I went looking for a new culture and a new way of life. Looks like I found\
  \ it."
