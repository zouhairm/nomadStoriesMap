Text: "It had been a rainy chilly day when my airplane landed in Marco Polo airport\
  \ in Venice, Italy. The fainted sun beam sneaked through glass ceilings and shed\
  \ light on the passengers dragging their bags to leave the building.\nAs the building\u2019\
  s parking lot was surrounded by the glorious green meadows and hills as the clean\
  \ chilly air fills the lungs with a fresh scent of life. The first stop to head\
  \ to is the lovely city of Verona.\nVerona is known as the city where Romeo and\
  \ Juliet initiated their love (as in Shakespeare\u2019s play), the house and balcony\
  \ of Juliet are of the most charming destination for tourists. As a visitor of Verona,\
  \ you must see Juliet\u2019s house the destination of many travelers from around\
  \ the globe; in its courtyard a bronze statue of Juliet is present. This statue\
  \ is visited by crowds who are seeking good fortune through touching the statue\u2019\
  s right breast, of course the statue which is placed now is a copy and the original\
  \ is exhibited inside hall of \u201CGiulietta\u2019s\u201D house-museum since 2014.\n\
  Walking around the city, the tempting smell of Le Piazze Bra food event can lead\
  \ to the location where the best products from all regions of Italy is resented.\
  \ With more than 30 stalls serving packed different types of wine, cheeses, salami,\
  \ ham, pizzas, risotto and piadinas, all gathered to serve their Italian products\
  \ to the locals and tourists.\nWhile spending morning and afternoon in Venice, the\
  \ choice to wander on feet is good as Venice city is relatively small enough for\
  \ a walk tour; small streets and bridges can be crossed, and an afternoon coffee\
  \ is tempting in small caf\xE9s at the center of the city.\nDifferent merchandise\
  \ can be found while crossing the alleys of Venice from printed t-shirts, sweaters,\
  \ hats and key chains to Venetian masks, which Venice is famous for. Small shops\
  \ are spread around selling different shaped and colored masks which are centuries\u2019\
  \ old tradition of the city and are typically worn during the Carnival of Venice.\
  \ What makes these masks unique is the ornate design and their bright color of Gold\
  \ and Silver, not to mention their complex decoration which stems from Comedia Dell\u2019\
  arte.\nBeing in Venice means visiting St. Mark\u2019s square where you can enjoy\
  \ watching people, feeding pigeons and having \"gelato\u201D and in case you felt\
  \ more adventurous then climbing the \u201CCampanile Di San Marco\u201D will do\
  \ the trick, and from the top you will be rewarded with the best views of the city.\n\
  Taking a tour in a \u201Cgondola\u201D allows further exploration of the lovely\
  \ city as it glides through the quiet waterways while passing under mini bridges\
  \ and along a section of the \"Grand Canal\u201D. \u201CGondola\u201D rides include\
  \ the beautiful enchanting of the gondolier upon request to add more charm to the\
  \ tour in this magical city.\nThe next stop is the cradle of the Renaissance, the\
  \ beautiful Florence. This city is very much known for its monuments, churches and\
  \ buildings; among which is Santa Maria del Fiore\u2019s cathedral known as the\
  \ Duomo; as well as the world\u2019s most iconic pieces of art such as the Birth\
  \ of Venus for Sandro Botticelli, and the statue of David by Michelangelo. Florence\u2019\
  s art scene is a true testament to human achievement in art.\nWandering in the streets\
  \ of Florence, you come across \u201CMercado de San Lorenzo\u201D where great deals\
  \ on leather can be found. The market is popular as the vendors are found talking\
  \ to tourists convincing them of providing good deals. The hanged products around\
  \ the market to the eyes of shoppers; bags, scarfs, gloves, sandals, boots, coats\
  \ and jackets of leather are seen in different colors to attract those who are seeking\
  \ good and cheap prices for medium quality, as for those who are looking for high\
  \ quality, luxurious leather then the shops around Florence can do the purpose.\n\
  Shopping at the evening, near closing time has two advantages; getting great deal\
  \ as the vendors may lower their price for extra cash in addition to the amazing\
  \ sunset view over the city as the sun sends its reddish yellow lights between the\
  \ clouds all over the city while fading away."
