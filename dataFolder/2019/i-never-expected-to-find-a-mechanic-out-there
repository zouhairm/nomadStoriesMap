Text: "As we came across the two beaten up VW hatchbacks on the side of the road,\
  \ we slowed down to check all was well. The red one in front had its bonnet open\
  \ and five men hovered over it, deep in discussion. Just as one of them gave me\
  \ a cheeky thumbs up, I pushed in the clutch to change down a gear.\n\nThen the\
  \ strangest thing happened, the pedal stayed in. Concerned, I pulled over, hoping\
  \ for a simple fix. But no such luck, the pedal was broken and now we were stuck,\
  \ slap bang in the middle of the Namib desert.\n\nNamibia\u2019s gravel roads are\
  \ as tough a challenge as any car will face. We\u2019d spent the morning driving\
  \ over miles of feisty corrugations that had bounced our Renault Duster 4WD all\
  \ over the place. Dusty, as we\u2019d christened her a week earlier, was tackling\
  \ her toughest mission yet, and she\u2019d just been wounded in action.\n\nThe Namib\
  \ Desert is a desolate place. All around us was a barren plain, topped with the\
  \ occasional grey boulder. The road stretched straight ahead as far as the eye could\
  \ see and the nearest town was a hundred kilometres away.\n\nFortunately, we somehow\
  \ had a cell phone signal and as Cindy hurriedly dialled our rental company, I tried\
  \ to figure out just how we\u2019d get ourselves out of this mess. My thoughts were\
  \ interrupted by one of the five Namibians, who\u2019d wandered over to help. After\
  \ we pushed the car to the side of the road he said, \u201CMy brother\u2019s a mechanic.\
  \ I\u2019ll get him to come and take a look\u201D.\n\nA few minutes later the mechanic\
  \ arrived, a skinny, grinning man with half his teeth missing. He quickly popped\
  \ open Dusty\u2019s hood, as visions of our rental agreement being voided rapidly\
  \ filled my mind. He quickly decided that the clutch pedal was indeed stuffed but\
  \ said that he could still help us drive.\n\nThat seemed like a great offer. After\
  \ all, what are the odds of breaking down right next to a mechanic? But still, the\
  \ warning bells were going off. Could we trust them? What would they want in return?\
  \ While Namibia is a relatively safe country, it does have an extremely high unemployment\
  \ rate and financially motivated crime is pretty common.\n\nThey left us for a bit,\
  \ while we spoke to our rental representative. She told us the decision was ours\
  \ and that while our concerns were legitimate, Namibians are normally just super\
  \ keen to lend a hand. Plus, did we really want to be stuck in the midday sun for\
  \ two hours waiting for the tow truck?\n\nAs we ended the call we saw the red hatchback\
  \ zoom past us, apparently fixed. As the second hatchback drove up alongside us,\
  \ we had a hasty decision to make. Do we wait or do we ask for help?\n\n\u201CSo\u201D\
  , I said, \u201CCan I really start this thing in second gear?\u201D. \u201CSure\u201D\
  , the man in the back said emphatically, \u201CIt\u2019s a diesel!\u201D. I didn\u2019\
  t bother asking why on earth that mattered. Within a minute we were plodding along\
  \ the road in second gear. But at least we were cool and moving forward, waiting\
  \ for the tow truck to appear like a mirage on the horizon.\n\nWhen it finally did,\
  \ we hopped up into the cab, breathing a huge sigh of relief. A few kilometres down\
  \ the road we passed the two hatchbacks again. Somehow both of them had now broken\
  \ down! Powerless to help, we could only wave goodbye. Looking up, they gave us\
  \ one final cheeky thumbs up.\n\nWhen you\u2019re stuck in the middle of a desert,\
  \ in the scorching heat, in a strange country, it\u2019s awfully hard to control\
  \ your emotions and to think rationally. But the reality is that most people aren\u2019\
  t out to get you and many are eager to help. Sometimes you just need to trust your\
  \ gut and take a leap of faith.\n\nThat\u2019s travelling sometimes. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to learn a lesson about faith and human kindness in the middle of the Namib\
  \ Desert and I certainly never expected to find a mechanic out there!"
