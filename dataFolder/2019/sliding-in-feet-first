Text: "I could barely swim but jumped into warm, inky black water nonetheless - naively\
  \ relying on the good nature of my fellow travellers should anything go horribly\
  \ wrong. The smell of sulphur lurked in the air and as I moved my arms, the water\
  \ glowed all around me. I was at Laguna de Manialtepec, a few kilometres outside\
  \ of Puerto Escondido, Mexico. \n\nA few minutes ago, I had climbed aboard a rickety\
  \ boat to take me out onto the lagoon. It was a moonless night- perfect for viewing\
  \ bioluminescent phytoplankton. An assertive American in our group had insisted\
  \ that we have enough life jackets on board, before we set sail. I was thinking\
  \ of safety too, of how I would never be able to jump into dark water, of how I\
  \ was here by myself. After years of travelling with friends and boyfriends, I had\
  \ travelled alone and here I was - in a boat, on a lagoon, in the dark. I hadn\u2019\
  t planned this and I was not ready. \n\nThe boat lurches forward unsteadily. The\
  \ engine cuts out - \u201CJump in Everyone!\u201D the captain says. He has done\
  \ this for years, its probably safe \u2013 a literal leap into the unseen. I think\
  \ of my work, how I live in spread sheets. I don\u2019t often deal with unknown\
  \ quantities, and I can calculate probabilities for everything else. I wish I could\
  \ just jump in, so I did the next best thing; I slid into the water feet first.\
  \ \n\nI felt adrenalin move through me. The water felt sticky, but I was still ok.\
  \ I watched some of the other travellers in my group swim freely. The plankton creating\
  \ lines of light around their bodies like a moving crime scene. I breathe deeply,\
  \ reminding myself that the human body floats naturally.  \n\nIt was a faint light\
  \ at first, an old light \u2013 something best visible when the moon vanished. As\
  \ I moved, it got brighter. A natural defence mechanism, tiny dinoflagellates emitting\
  \ pulses of light. I felt safer and laughed, the water wasn\u2019t dark and just\
  \ maybe, I was also not alone. \n\nLater, as tiny phytoplankton still clung to my\
  \ clothes, their glow slowly waning away; I realised that I had no photos. Bioluminescence\
  \ doesn\u2019t photograph well on ordinary cameras. It is quite a fitting end really,\
  \ just a fading memory of a transient natural phenomenon."
