Text: "I packed and repacked my bag with the accompaniment of a childhood promise\
  \ forged between my mother and I, made long-ago on the front porch of our old house\
  \ in a past life. This promise to go to India had been left dangling in the wind,\
  \ strung up on a line with so many other dreams that over the years it had faded\
  \ and creased and been folded and put away behind greater responsibilities. We finally\
  \ rediscovered it, buried beneath small life crises. We dusted it off and spread\
  \ it out. \n\nIndia. Let\u2019s go, we decided: let\u2019s finally pour ourselves\
  \ into this country, get lost in the sea of it, swim around in our dreams. \n\n\
  We left, our bodies thrumming with fresh vaccinations, unprepared for what awaited.\
  \ Delhi hit us with her intensity, blanketing us in smog, accosted us with crowds\
  \ and suffocating sounds. Horns, shouts, motors, the clop of cow hooves on the rubble-strewn\
  \ streets. Knees trembling, voices failing, we sheltered in our hotel room in the\
  \ cool evening, trying our best to wash away the culture shock with our bucket of\
  \ cold water. We expected this, we thought. We came here to be absorbed.\n \nTry\
  \ as we might, the city proved impervious to our desire to blend in, to tumble into\
  \ the streets along with the throngs. The Taj Mahal gleaned in Agra\u2019s sunlight,\
  \ Humayan\u2019s Tomb rose hypnotically from the misty twilight and our bare feet\
  \ brushed against the shared stone paths of the Raj Ghat, resting place of Mahatma\
  \ Gandhi. We marvelled at our driver\u2019s ability to locate us from the entryway,\
  \ still freshly bathed in our naivety. Amongst the endless wave of people, my blonde\
  \ hair caught amongst the black. Dressed in our Western clothes, unable to so much\
  \ as cross the street unchaperoned, my mother and I stood out as two fish swimming\
  \ in the wrong direction. We were a pair of foreigners, experiencing the meaning\
  \ of the word foreign for the first time, cast adrift in the maze of colour and\
  \ history.  \n\nIt took two weeks in Rajasthan to start to acclimatise. I don\u2019\
  t mind if I am asked to be photographed, I had decided before coming, pre-warned\
  \ what it might be like at tourist sites. If I am also taking photos, then it seems\
  \ only fair to exchange that right. \n\nWe trickled through a series of homestays,\
  \ blessed by unprecedented generosity as we worked our way through different cities.\
  \ I drank freshly-brewed chai from the roadside in Jaisalmer, ate blindly with my\
  \ fingertips in the dark of the Thar desert, smothered hot bajra rotis with ghee\
  \ in Jaipur, allowing them to melt slowly on my tongue. And each day was a new experience,\
  \ bringing with it the new phenomenon of being filmed and touched and photographed\
  \ wherever we went, causing a stir among the streets whenever I caught eyes with\
  \ a stranger and could see my own alienness reflected in that curiosity.   \n\n\u201C\
  Please, one photo, one photo, please.\u201D I tried patience, I forced smiles, I\
  \ posed with families, holding babies, in the arms of complete strangers. Crowds\
  \ would form, gathered around; mostly nice, sometimes not. \n\nI look back on my\
  \ own photographs and realise I have almost none with local people in them. I carry\
  \ memories and stories of people whose kindness touched me, but rarely did we stop\
  \ long enough to capture them in a photo. We went to India with the idea of finding\
  \ the exotic, not realising that, to others, we were the strange, the unusual; the\
  \ object of stares and whispers and \u201CMam\u2014selfie?\u201D \n\nAs I settle\
  \ back to anonymity at home, I still wonder at this experience. My mother and I\
  \ travelled to India to fulfil a dream and snapshot moments of it, to create a blanket\
  \ of memory to slide down once it was over. And yet, through this experience, we\
  \ also became snapshots for other people: small memories in their own lives, a fleeting\
  \ image replicated dozens of times. \n\nLooking back on the journey, we carry a\
  \ strong conviction: India\u2019s yield\u2014her vibrancy, chaos, humanity\u2014\
  is far greater and grander than what a thousand photographs could ever take."
