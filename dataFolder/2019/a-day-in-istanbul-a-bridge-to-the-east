Text: "There was a strong smell of sweet in the streets coming from the traditional\
  \ hookah pipes \u2013 a very popular Turkish flavored smoke. The men in the streets\
  \ drinking apple tea and playing gammon in a normal afternoon was a perfect scenario\
  \ for me to arrive in Istanbul. \n\nIstanbul was the center of the Catholic Eastern\
  \ Roman Empire of Constantinople from 395\u20131204 and 1261\u20131453. However,\
  \ it has been also the capital for the Muslim Ottoman Empire, from 1453\u20131922.\
  \ The This civilizational path and tension is all around the city for the visitor\
  \ to dive in. This cultural melting pot depicts the social and cultural life of\
  \ Turkish people until today and specially in Istanbul.\n\nAt the Hagia Sophia Mosque\
  \ \u2013 a UNESCO human patrimony -  the visit will be challenged to understand\
  \ the strong bonds and tights between the Western and Eastern Civilization. In the\
  \ same construction the visitor will finds pictures and images on Jesus Crist from\
  \ the Bezantine Era, as well as the words from the Muslim Koran. Walking to the\
  \ city\u2019s streets and talking to people one can fully understand how this fusion\
  \ has molded the contemporary Istanbul, a mix of modernity and history at the same\
  \ place. \n\nThe Grand Bazar is one of the world\u2019s biggest open markets. Its\
  \ drizzling corridors of jewelry shops, pashminas (Turkish traditional scarfs) and\
  \ foods and spices are a universe to be explored. A full morning was necessary to\
  \ explore all the Bazar\u2019s maze. And if good price and shopping opportunities\
  \ is what you are looking for, you came to the right place. Turkish street merchants\
  \ are known by their challenging and impetuous negotiation skills. Challenge accepted!\
  \ I negotiated for almost half an hour for a dozens of Turkish pashmina. It went\
  \ well, but not after many debate on the overall price, which was not initially\
  \ specified at all.  \n\nFrom the Galata Tower \u2013 an ancient scout observatory\
  \ for the Bosphorus Strait \u2013 it is possible to see Eastern side of Istanbul\
  \ and the ships pathway from the Black Sea and the entrance to the Mediterranean\
  \ Sea.\n\nIn a cheap van I crossed from the Western to the Eastern side of Istanbul,\
  \ crossing the 1973\u2019s Bosphorus Bridge. I was expecting a different kind of\
  \ sight-seeing and discovery. I was right: the eastern side is much more traditional,\
  \ with smaller buildings and an air of tranquility and easier community. Women and\
  \ children were enjoying a beautiful sunny day, all of them swimming with their\
  \ traditional burkas, covering their bodies. If you like to see how really people\
  \ live it tells a kind and worm story.\n\nWe took a ferryboat back to the ancient\
  \ Istanbul, where the streets were crowded near the boat stop. The was a fish market\
  \ at is full throttle. People screaming loud prices and walking almost through each\
  \ other. At the side of the Bosphorus canal a long boat line was formed: they were\
  \ serving fresh fried fish with onion sandwich form lunch. Hundreds of people were\
  \ lined up to have a snack and drinking the Turkish ayran yogurt, a mixture of raw\
  \ yogurt, water and salt, a common accompaniment to meals.  The sun was going down\
  \ in the Bosphorus as we ate. A good way to end the second part of our journey.\
  \ There was still the night to enjoy. \n\nIn our way back to the hotel, located\
  \ in shop and pedestrian crowded Istiklal Street, a woman felt in the pavement in\
  \ front of me. My immediate instinct was to help her. However, I was quickly reminded\
  \ that I was a foreigner and that woman are not to be touched in any way by other\
  \ man then those from her family and husband, as it is for most Muslim. Thus, suddenly,\
  \ three men three men accompanying the lady interrupted my initiative and raised\
  \ her by the arm.  \n\nIstanbul is an experience. People are kind, it has a flourishing\
  \ and modern city and youth combined with an also great and provocative past, which\
  \ tell us not only about the local and national history, but the pillars of great\
  \ human civilizations."
