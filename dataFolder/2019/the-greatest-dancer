Text: "He shakily poured the grappa into my glass of water, holding the bottle below\
  \ the table to avoid being discovered, smiling cheekily at the secrecy. For a moment\
  \ he looked like a 15-year-old boy spiking punch on prom night, not the 85-year-old\
  \ man he actually was. \n\nWe toasted to our health and the night ahead as he grimaced\
  \ at the strength of his evening elixir.\n\n\u201CYou know, it\u2019s very good\
  \ that you\u2019ve come all the way out to this dance hall in Venice,\u201D he said\
  \ leaning back into his chair, his thick accent charmingly accentuating each vowel.\
  \ \n\n\u201CNot many young people come to this place because they think we\u2019\
  re too told. We do the cha-cha, we waltz, all the old dancing. No one has time to\
  \ come see us, but you have come and it\u2019s very nice. Bellissima!\u201D\n\n\
  We toasted again and sipped our supply. \n\nHe was the greatest dancer. I had watched\
  \ him all night from our table as he led women in perfect timing to the band\u2019\
  s covers of Peppino Gagliardi. He never seemed to run out of energy, moving so gracefully\
  \ despite the mild hunch in his back. Every step seemed premeditated and was perfectly\
  \ executed. He knew he was good, which made watching him even better.\n\n\u201C\
  Are you from Venice, Quintino?\u201D I asked. \n\n\u201CNo, no, I\u2019m Sicilian,\
  \  but actually, I was born in Tripoli, in Libya. My whole extended family relocated\
  \ there because there were no jobs in Italy. That\u2019s where I grew up. In fact,\
  \ my uncle opened the first dance club in Tripoli.\u201D \n\n\u201CIt was open air,\u201D\
  \ he gesticulated, \u201Cnear the beach. It was beautiful. In the summertime, my\
  \ father would make sandwiches in the kitchen and I would serve them to the beautiful\
  \ ladies having lunch in the sun. They\u2019d see me and say, \u201CQuintino, come\
  \ and dance with me.\u201D \nThat\u2019s how I learned.\u201D\n\nHe stared into\
  \ his glass rotating it slowly. It was as if it was a portal into his childhood\
  \ memories. He kept staring deeply while talking.\n\n\u201CWhen I got older I bought\
  \ a Vespa. I used to ride it straight to the club after work and I would dance there\
  \ from six in the evening to two o\u2019clock in the morning! My uncle had lights\
  \ hanging above the dance floor and everyone would slow-dance to the music with\
  \ the waves from the ocean crashing against the cliff face down below. Bellissima.\
  \ I\u2019d stay till the very last minute until I was the last person dancing.\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CAfterwards, I\u2019d jump on my scooter and ride home, arriving at three.\
  \ I\u2019d creep carefully up the stairs and fall into my bed. By 6:30 a.m. my mama\
  \ would tap on my shoulder and say, \u201CQuintino, you have 30 minutes to get ready\
  \ for work.\u201D I\u2019d grunt and swat her away. \n\nThen she would come back\
  \ and say, \u201CQuintino, you have 15 minutes.\u201D \n\nI whined and shooed her\
  \ away again. Then she\u2019d come in the last time and say, \u201CQuintino! 5 minutes\
  \ to 7 a.m.!\u201D\n\nAt this, I\u2019d jump out of bed, quickly wash my face, change,\
  \ sip the coffee mama made for me and kiss her cheek as I left the house. But I\u2019\
  d leave the scooter at home this time you know why?\u201D he asked leaning closer.\
  \ His gold tooth glistening in the dance hall lights. \n\n\u201CI never needed the\
  \ scooter because my work was in the building across the road!\u201D \n\nAt this\
  \ he laughed raucously, mouth gaping. Snorting heavily as his large body bounced\
  \ up and down. I started laughing too, not at the joke but at how his body jiggled\
  \ violently.\n\n\u201CAhhh,\u201D he sighed looking ahead and then smiling back\
  \ at me with warmth, his head tilted. \u201CI miss it there, but I also love it\
  \ here. I\u2019m Italian, I\u2019ll always have my dancing to remind me of my old\
  \ home. Cause you can dance anywhere and that is home.\u201D \n\n\u201CCheers to\
  \ that,\u201D I said with a consolatory and arm on his shoulder, clinking my glass\
  \ to his as he managed one more laugh and managed his last swig."
