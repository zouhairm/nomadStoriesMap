Text: "\u2018Nobody really knows how to get there, but the dog does.\u2019 another\
  \ traveller recalled at the hostel we\u2019d been calling home. \n \nSure enough\
  \ as we entered the clearing, there she was, her shiny black coat glistening in\
  \ the sunlight, her eager eyes gazing back at us. As if she had been waiting for\
  \ us, as if it was planned. She led us down a rickety wooden path and down to what\
  \ appeared to be a dead end. She looked back to make sure we were still following\
  \ her, then lunged straight down into the cool, crystal-clear water. We looked at\
  \ each other for reassurance and then, much more carefully, clambered down into\
  \ the knee deep river. We followed the stray through treacherous jungle and cool\
  \ pools of water. Twisting and turning in different directions until we were sure\
  \ we\u2019d never find the way back alone. \n \nJust as our feet were about to give\
  \ up, she stopped, turned in a circle and settled herself down in a heap, basking\
  \ in the warm sun. It was clear this was as far as she would be taking us, but that\
  \ she would be waiting. Patiently, loyally waiting for our return. We moved closer\
  \ to edge where we could hear the water rushing faster, falling and crashing onto\
  \ the rocks, before settling in the deep turquoise pool below us. It was a long\
  \ way down but this is what we had come for, and in the intense heat there was no\
  \ way we could resist the temptation of the icy, cold bath that awaited. I edged\
  \ a little bit closer, closed my eyes, took a deep breath and jumped. There was\
  \ no way of knowing how deep the water below us was or what lay beneath the surface,\
  \ but something told me trust our new friend that had led us here. I plummeted at\
  \ speed for what felt like a lifetime and just when I thought the fall was never\
  \ going to end, I felt the impact of the crisp, glacial liquid shocking every nerve\
  \ in my body and submerging me as I plunged into its depth. As I rose to the top\
  \ looking up to the vast sky stretching above my head blocked only by the shadow\
  \ of the ledge I had just launched myself from. Smiling and high with adrenaline,\
  \ suddenly, an awful feeling began twisting in my stomach. A powerful splash to\
  \ my right welcomed the arrival of my travel companion and as she too appeared at\
  \ the surface I saw her wide smile turn to horror the way I imagined mine had seconds\
  \ before. We looked at each other but did not have to utter the question we were\
  \ both thinking. The worry that consumed us to the point we could no longer enjoy\
  \ the picture-perfect scene around us. \u2018How do we get back up?\u2019 The water\
  \ that once felt so refreshing now felt fatal. We desperately looked around for\
  \ salvation. \n \nAgainst the rock face, hidden between the leafy textures, something\
  \ looked out of place. An unnatural bulk against the smooth wet stone. A lifeline,\
  \ a miracle, a rope. The tiresome journey had taken its toll and it took all my\
  \ remaining strength to heave myself out of the pool and all my concentration to\
  \ calculate each step, one wrong move and that would be the end of the adventure\
  \ and possibly my life. \nI had to keep going, I had to reach the top, I had to\
  \ not... look... down... Finally I saw the familiar wet nose of the faithful friend\
  \ that had brought us here and relief washed over me. Unaware of the dangers we\
  \ had  faced she excitedly led us back to the path. We were ready to go home, but\
  \ I'll never regret taking the leap."
