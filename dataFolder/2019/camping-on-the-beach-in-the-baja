Text: "My first exposure to life abroad occurred during a camping expedition in the\
  \ Baja of Mexico. I remember landing in Loreto on a hot and squally night. The air\
  \ was thick and wet; the massive palms were a mystery to a child who grew up around\
  \ pine, spruce and aspen.\n\nThe taste of salt in the wind hit me as I stepped out\
  \ of the plane onto the tarmac. The air felt electric from a storm that passed before\
  \ our descent into the mountainous range.\n\nIt was past midnight when my family\
  \ arrived at our campsite on the beach near Lig\xFC\xED. The ocean encroached all\
  \ of my senses. Celestial bodies lit the way as we ran to the shore to play in the\
  \ hot salty water. Our feverish dance in the shallows was replaced by a euphoric\
  \ kind of exhaustion. I awoke to the sound of water crashing; I dreamt that I was\
  \ in the bowels of an enormous ship on a stormy sea. \n\nThe food is something I\
  \ will never forget; my mind clings to the memory of seafood being roasted over\
  \ open fire with butter and lime juice. My father and the men from the nearby town\
  \ of Lig\xFC\xED went fishing every day and collected clams from the reef offshore.\
  \ We schucked the clams, roasted them with lime, butter and a little bit of salsa.\
  \ Their muscled tissues were rich with the taste of sea brine; I still crave that\
  \ salty, acidic smokiness.\n\nWe spent New Years in Ligui, the celebration is deeply\
  \ embedded in my memory. The adults drank and broke pi\xF1atas with wooden bats\
  \ while my new friend Bianca and I remained busy with our game of hide and seek\
  \ tag. We would chase each other until we were breathless and giddy. Neither of\
  \ us spoke the other\u2019s native tongue, so we didn\u2019t learn very much about\
  \ one another, however we always managed to find something to laugh about. \n\n\
  My family became close with the people of Lig\xFC\xED. Often we would play baseball\
  \ with them; the locals would play barefoot, unaffected by cacti and loose rocks\
  \ beneath their soles. They howled when we attempted to play with our feet bare.\
  \ Our erratic movements were cut short by small aggregates committing their savage\
  \ onslaught upon our uncalloused feet. \n\nScorpions burrowed into the sand as we\
  \ lifted the tarps that our temporary homes lay on for a month. The day we left\
  \ was nothing like the day we arrived, the southern winds were stifling. The sun\
  \ in all of its terrific brutality bore down on our shoulders as we hugged our new\
  \ friends goodbye. I felt downhearted as the dirt road brought us away from the\
  \ ocean and into the rolling hills. I realized that my time in Ligui had passed,\
  \ confined now to a memory. I\u2019ve since visited, Bianca now has children, Lig\xFC\
  \xED is her home. The town remains mostly unchanged, and the breeze still tastes\
  \ of brine."
