Text: "As I stared at myself in the mirror of the shared bathroom, splashing icy water\
  \ on my face, I barely recognised the man looking back at me. It was a stranger\u2019\
  s face, gaunt through weeks of hiking up and down mountain paths, into dense forests\
  \ and across fields scorched brown by the sun. After nearly a month of trekking\
  \ the Camino de Santiago, I\u2019d be reaching Santiago de Compostela in just a\
  \ few hours. \n\nIt was still dark as I set out, my calves groaning and my feet\
  \ in outright mutiny as I began walking. When I started this journey I was so confused\
  \ about the direction of my life, so unsure of my identity. I was in my early 20s\
  \ and already I felt washed-up and broken, but the last few weeks had given me a\
  \ glimmer of hope.\n\nBefore long I reached a clearing. Two statues stood watch\
  \ above me, their fingertips pointing across the valley and down towards Santiago\
  \ itself.  The three spires of the distant Cathedral were cast in an eerie shadow.\
  \ It looked more like a film set with the lights turned off than a real city I thought,\
  \ descending slowly. \n\nThe next hour was a blur but arriving in Santiago jolted\
  \ me back to life. I had to concentrate when navigating the narrow lanes; with every\
  \ turn, there were more locals peddling souvenirs, more pungent odours of freshly\
  \ caught fish stacked on wooden chests, suffocated by ice that crashed onto the\
  \ pavement. An exhausted man took some of the ice in his hand and held it to his\
  \ forehead. There were others like me; weighed down by our rucksacks, wide-eyed\
  \ and stumbling along the alleyways.\n\nWe\u2019d reached the Cathedral. Inside,\
  \ choir boys eyed us warily as clouds of incense wafted upwards to the ceiling.\
  \ A priest with a squashed nose pointed directly at me then at a door to his left;\
  \ I bowed slightly but by the time I looked up again, he was walking in the other\
  \ direction. After waiting in line to receive my certificate of completion, I eventually\
  \ reached the front and placed my Pilgrim\u2019s Passport on the table. A final\
  \ stamp was smacked down onto it as a clerk filled out the paperwork. \n\n\u201C\
  Did you have fun?\u201D the clerk asked without looking up at me.\n\nI glanced down\
  \ at the floor and closed my eyes, casting my mind back. To the graffiti on the\
  \ barn door after leaving Sarria, telling Laura not to worry and I\u2019ll wait\
  \ for you in Portomarin, love Alex. And to that night in the church in Logro\xF1\
  o, when I\u2019d barely slept under the sad gaze of a discoloured icon of the Virgin\
  \ Mary. And the beautiful German woman, with her shining eyes and infectious laugh\
  \ who\u2019d flirted with me for two days straight, and I hadn\u2019t even realised\
  \ until we became separated on the route. What was her name? Why couldn\u2019t I\
  \ remember her name?\n\nI opened my eyes and the clerk looked up from her desk,\
  \ smiling. \u201CWell done,\u201D she said handing me the certificate, before gesturing\
  \ to the next in line. I limped towards the exit.\n\nIn the courtyard outside the\
  \ Cathedral, I set my rucksack down against a sandstone wall and swung my legs over\
  \ the side. I surveyed the scene below me. Crisply dressed tourists were struggling\
  \ in the heat whilst locals eyed them from a distance. Close by, a small child was\
  \ being held up on a ledge by an elderly man. They launched paper aeroplanes at\
  \ the people below, their foreheads touching and their arms waving whenever one\
  \ of their creations caught the wind. I thought of my own granddad who did that\
  \ with me back in East London, overlooking all of the market traders below us and\
  \ the streetwise mothers who were eager for a bargain. It was nearly 20 years ago,\
  \ and yet it was here and now, alive again in this old man and the child clutched\
  \ tight to his chest.\n\nI shook my head and wryly smiled, unable to suppress the\
  \ scratchy feeling at the back of my throat. I didn\u2019t know where I was going\
  \ next, but for now, I really didn\u2019t care."
