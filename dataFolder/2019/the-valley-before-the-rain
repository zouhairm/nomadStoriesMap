Text: "The valley before the rain \n\nI never tired of my view from the Merenid Tombs\
  \ looking over at the beauty that is Fes. Minarets, the echo of the call to prayer\
  \ and an air thick of a foreign heat filled me. This evening was special. Two of\
  \ my new local friends instructed us on how to travel to Chefchouan, a magical blue\
  \ valley that sits in the North of Morocco. My friend and I set off on a local bus\
  \ where we had to change in Tetouan. \u201CYou need to get a petit taxi to get a\
  \ grand taxi,\u201D said a man. The expression on my face was puzzled as I struggled\
  \ to communicate in Darija, the local Arabic dialect, in the early hours of the\
  \ morning. We eventually found ourselves at another taxi rank. Different to the\
  \ colourful Peugeot 205 petite taxi\u2019s, the old beige Mercedes Benz sat there\
  \ expectantly. We didn\u2019t understand that we had to share the front of the passenger\u2019\
  s seat, the preferred seating method in Morocco. The intimacy of sharing a seat\
  \ was something else. I had known and loved my friend for many years but there was\
  \ a protective barrier lifted by the intimacy of this journey. The vast panes of\
  \ landscape were beautiful yet terrifying. The roads were minuscule in comparison\
  \ to the heights of the towering cliffs. With every deep turn we drew closer to\
  \ the edge. My stomach churned. Deprived of sleep, many a time I thought this is\
  \ it. The next turn we will tumble off this cliff and become one with the beautiful\
  \ view. If this is how I go, sharing a seat with my friend, I will go laughing!\n\
  \nWhere the blue of the sky and city meet\u2026 \n\nAt 6am the square of the city\
  \ was vacant. The air crisp and cold. To my right, blue. To my left, blue. It filled\
  \ my eyes with a calmness I had not felt in years. We sat at a local cafe, sipping\
  \ some bissara, a local broad bean soup that is drenched in aromatic olive oil.\
  \ I\u2019ve never taken to this soup before but today I was tired; it was both comforting\
  \ and warm. After napping we set off to explore the city. There was a calm ambience\
  \ in the streets and souks. Although plentiful they were not as wondrous as the\
  \ windy streets of Fes. We welcomed this as not getting lost for once would be much\
  \ appreciated! We met a shop owner Yusuf who proudly showed us the contents in his\
  \ shop. The jackets were a rainbow of colours that resembled the city - woven textures\
  \ of rustic simplicity.\n\nRemember the places you are brought to tears are where\
  \ your treasure is\u2026.\n\nWe decided that we would climb the hill which housed\
  \ the Spanish Mosque built during the Rif war in the 1920\u2019s. We passed the\
  \ bridge where women sat washing their clothes with soap bars on concrete slabs\
  \ whilst their children splashed in the river. It was hard to feel anything but\
  \ peace. Exchanging smiles we crossed the river and climbed the muddy hill. It was\
  \ only a short hike and by the time we had risen to the top we had an hour to go\
  \ before sunset. I remember looking around me at the city. I could almost comprehend\
  \ its beauty now that it had shrunk in size. Standing there following my breath,\
  \ I came to tears. Why I do not know. I think in hindsight it was the first time\
  \ I felt truly free. I had set off on a journey to learn a language I vowed to do\
  \ years earlier. I had always been guarded of my emotions but there, in that valley,\
  \ I decided that I wanted to open myself up to the vulnerability of connections.\
  \ As I descended, I did with an open heart. \n  \nOn that day in Chouen I opened\
  \ myself to love. Relationships, that I would soon become lost in and need to be\
  \ cleansed from. It was the beginning of a journey of love and loss that has taught\
  \ me the impermanence of everything; how all moods like clouds eventually pass,\
  \ and with rainfall you will always stand anew."
