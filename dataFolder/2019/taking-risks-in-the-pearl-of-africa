Text: "Prior to stepping off the plane in Uganda, my only reference for East Africa\
  \ was my family's home country of Eritrea. Nostalgically, I recalled our family\
  \ trips to the cyanic Red Sea in Massawa, and traversing the windy, mountainous\
  \ roads to the ancient city of Keren. This feeling of familiarity swept over me\
  \ as I was quickly reminded that this time I was alone and venturing into the unknown.\n\
  \nThe Pearl of Africa. \n\nThose first few moments after landing in a new country,\
  \ peeping through the airplane window, eager to get a first glance of this new destination\
  \ has been one of my favorite parts of traveling. I\u2019m able to take in a country\u2019\
  s natural beauty as a mere observer, removed from the chaos, if only briefly. Lifting\
  \ the window blinds, I still remember that initial feeling of awe. Immediately,\
  \ I was struck by the lush, green backdrop of trees and never- ending plains stretching\
  \ around us. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Lake Victoria reflecting a\
  \ relentless afternoon sun. Wow, this was breathtaking. \nSix months later, here\
  \ I am, on the edge of Mount Elgon, just a few meters away from the largest waterfall\
  \ in Sipi Falls, about to rappel 100 meters. \n\n100 meters.\n\nAt this moment,\
  \ in an attempt to calm myself down, the memory of when I first landed in Uganda\
  \ and experienced my first star-struck moment of Uganda\u2019s verdant oasis came\
  \ to mind. My fear of leaping into the unknown and rappelling down the side of a\
  \ mountain was momentarily comforted by these warm memories. \n\nThis isn\u2019\
  t crazy, right? \n\nNot one to turn down a challenge, I\u2019ve found that taking\
  \ risks while I travel has led to some of my most memorable experiences. Carefully,\
  \ I release my hands from the steel bar and grip the rope that is tied from my harness\
  \ to the top of the mountain. I take a big breath in and I walk my feet off the\
  \ ledge, not trying to look down. I decide to look to my right where the sounds\
  \ of the crashing waterfall catch my attention. Weightless, I settle into my harness\
  \ and can\u2019t help but become overwhelmed by this incredible view. From here,\
  \ I can see the entire waterfall spill over the ledge and crash towards the ground\
  \ where towering trees carrying unripen plantains are waiting.  I sneak a peek down\
  \ and intertwined feelings of exhilaration and uneasiness rush over me. Over the\
  \ last seven months, exploring the unknown and taking risks like this one, cause\
  \ me to experience an amalgam of emotions: fear, excitement, trepidation and curiosity.\
  \ With each risk, my leap into the unknown feels less terrifying and I find myself\
  \ embracing the challenge more readily. I don\u2019t know what will be waiting for\
  \ me at the other end, but if my travels have taught me anything, welcoming the\
  \ unknown forces you to let go of your preconceptions, challenges you, and immerses\
  \ you in a once in a lifetime experience."
