Text: "After seventeen hours as a tourist just at Istanbul airport, the loudspeakers\
  \ announced the departure of Turkish Airlines flight 720 to Mumbai. Delivery of\
  \ passage. Metal detector. Welcome. \n\n-We are starting the descent in Mumbai,\
  \ it is 5:15 am. local time, I hope you enjoyed the flight\n\nI can't believe I\
  \ am in India. The country of zen, of meditation, of thousands of gods (more than\
  \ 18.000) and hundreds of different languages. I got off the plane with a smile\
  \ that was soon erased, hundreds of Hindus running at full speed trying to get first\
  \ on line to migrations. They received me with elbows, skips on the line and a rush\
  \ that I never imagined. My turn. I give my passport, visa, etc. but a not friendly\
  \ face officer asked me for the address and telephone number of the hotel. Obviously\
  \ I didn\u2019t have any of that, I didn\u2019t even have a hotel. I told him that\
  \ I was going to see a friend but I couldn\u2019t remember the phone nor address.\
  \ -No. Next - the officer called the next one leaving me standing on one side not\
  \ knowing what to do. Between one and the other, I got in and try to explain the\
  \ situation again. - No. Next - called another one. My first hour in India is nothing\
  \ like what i imagine and this guy is on my way so I have to play my cards now.\
  \ Took the little notebook that I always carry with me and wrote down \"Vimal's\
  \ Hostal\" and my phone number. I handed it to the custom officer and that was it,\
  \ yeap, that \u201Ceasy\u201D. You can see my smile from a long distance till\u2026\
  \ again to the cumshots, skipping and elbows fight to get my bag.\n\nAt the gate\
  \ of Bombay airport I met Nela, the Czech girl who convince me to come to India.\
  \ We chatted for a while and we took a \"ricksha\" (is like moto-taxi) to meet Adriana,\
  \ a girl from New Orleans and Vimal, an indian guy who, thanks for coachsurfing\
  \ decided to host us all.\n\tThat kind of three-wheeled motorcycle took us at full\
  \ speed dodging every passerby, motorcycle, car and cow on the road. OMG! I don\u2019\
  t even want to try to start driving in this country! Oh, something you must remember:\
  \ everyone, everyone, absolutely everyone, honks al the time; in fact, many vehicles\
  \ have a sticker that asks you to make it sound. We arrived at Vimal\u2019s house,\
  \ his mother received us wrapped in his saree (dress), bowing with both hands together.\
  \ What should do I do? Do I lean? Do I kiss? Again, standing there looking lost\
  \ ... well, a smile and wave the hand -Hi, thanks- now I looked even worse. \nWe\
  \ decided to take a 20-minute nap that lasted 4 hours and we got up to go out for\
  \ the night. One thing that surprised me was the amount of construction there, every\
  \ hundred meters there are two or three new buildings, highways and trains.\n\n\
  Vimal took two days off from work and rented a car with a driver for us. He is a\
  \ private investigator who discovers frauds and crimes in important companies. Really?\
  \ - Yes, like James Bond - he said. Sounds like a really cool job. We arrived at\
  \ a restaurant and they order food for me. I taste a small portion, they burn me\
  \ to the hair. I take one liter of water, one zip. -How do you say \"without spicy\
  \ in Hindu?\"- I ask smiling dissembling my tremendous dissatisfaction. \"Vina masala\"\
  \ Perfect, I already know the first most important words. We left the restaurant,\
  \ ate a \"dessert\" on the street. A something wrapped in a eucalyptus tree leaf.\
  \ Delicious, but this time, too sweet. We walked around the place for a while until\
  \ we found the bar \"Leopolds\". Down the street from that bar, a few years ago,\
  \ a group of guerrillas entered with weapons, first to the Taj Mahal hotel and then\
  \ to the bar killing anyone who crossed the road, there are still traces of bullets\
  \ embedded in the wall. We met the German rocker, who walked with tremendous fart,\
  \ had forgotten the headphones on the plane...\n\nto be continue..."
