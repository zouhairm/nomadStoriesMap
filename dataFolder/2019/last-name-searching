Text: "\u201CHow can your parents let you travel alone?\u201D, that question in the\
  \ middle of the street, while I was eating a hamburguer, still exist in my consciousness.\
  \ \n\nIt has been 4 years already, and it's what I most remember from that daily\
  \ trip I made. I was talking to the guy at the register about my last name, the\
  \ reason of me being there.\nOut of nowhere, he asked me that question. I still\
  \ don't know if he asked me because I look younger or if the whole idea of researching\
  \ about my last name was crazy for him. And now that I am writing about this, I\
  \ must say that my plan had something surreal about it.\n\nI was backpacking with\
  \ a friend in Europe, in the Middle of the summer, after a university exchange program.\
  \ When we arrived in Krakow, Poland, she asked me if I want to go to Auschwitz.\
  \ I refused, because I wanted to go there with a relative (I still owe them that).\n\
  In spite of that, I decided to go to a small city nearby. Wadowice. My av\xF3 (grandmother\
  \ in portuguese) told me about this city. It's supposed to be the city of her last\
  \ name, Woitowitz. Although, I found the city through other detail that I remembered:\
  \ it was the birthplace of Pope John Paul II. So I took a bus to go there.\n \n\
  This city is between hills in the western of Poland. I was impressed by the amount\
  \ of green grass that I saw. I went straight to the tourist information office and\
  \ they gave me so many options of atractions, like a foot trail on the Goryczkowiec\
  \ hill.  But I wasn\u2019t there for that. I wanted to go to a jewish museum or\
  \ a cemetery, but the cemetery was closed and the museum didn\u2019t exist. So I\
  \ did one tourist thing: ate a Napoleonka or krem\xF3wka, a Polish type of cream\
  \ pie near the square. It was nice but I still had another thing on my mind. So\
  \ I started walking around between posters and souvenirs of Pope John. In that mood,\
  \ I decided to eat a hamburger. It seemed easy to order, I didn't know any polish.\
  \ Lucky to me, they spoke english. We started talking, and they helped me. Even\
  \ if they doubted that I could find my last name, they spelled it in a polish way.\
  \ Woitowitczyk.\n \n \nBefore I looked everywhere to find my last name. Now I'm\
  \ looking with other eyes. I followed my route to the Parish Cemetery. I got lost\
  \ among the 5000 graves in the cemetery, the oldest one is from 1839. But I didn\u2019\
  t find my last name in any gravestone, not even the new poland one that they gave\
  \ me. \n \nOn my way back to pick up a transfer to Krak\xF3w, I found a park. I\
  \ started walking through and I found a memorial. In the list of names, I found\
  \ one similar to mine. Now I know that it was a Katyn Cross with a small memorial\
  \ for the tragic crash plane in 2010. The Katyn Cross is a memorial for all the\
  \ writers, captains, royals, teachers and journalists that stood up to for the rights\
  \ of the community against the Soviet Union.\n\nI realized then that searching for\
  \ my last name by myself in a strange place, was brave. However, will I be brave\
  \ enough to embrace this new last name? This new history? The one that already happened\
  \ but I didn't know about? We think the unknown is out there in the world, but sometimes\
  \ is hidden within ourselves. It may show up in a trip, but it takes more than a\
  \ journey for it to be a part of us."
