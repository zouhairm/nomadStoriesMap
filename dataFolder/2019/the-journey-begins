Text: "Ever since I got here it\u2019s been an life-changing experience because I\u2019\
  ve learnt so much in a very less amount of time. I\u2019ve met amazing people who\
  \ make me want to live again and make me realise that life isn\u2019t only about\
  \ the struggles and the hardships but it\u2019s about the tiny moments of hope we\
  \ find in those struggles and hardships. I come from India and I\u2019ve moved to\
  \ Italy to study medicine in the famous university of Cattolica, which gave me and\
  \ opportunity to build my confidence and also made me believe in myself. The day\
  \ I stepped in Italy I knew it was going to be a long and a tough journey but I\
  \ will fight through it and make myself and my beloved parents proud because that\u2019\
  s the very purpose of my life. Obviously my life hasn\u2019t been all rainbows and\
  \ candies, I\u2019ve had really tough times and sometimes they were so painful that\
  \ I thought I would die due to the pain it was causing me, but you know there\u2019\
  s always a sunrise after a sunset and nothing is absolute in this world so we can\u2019\
  t waste anymore time on things and people that don\u2019t matter because life is\
  \ short and by short I mean you could die the very next second. It\u2019s so beautiful\
  \ that I want to make the most of my life and never regret anything I do further\
  \ on. I\u2019m not in rush to find a love worth risking but I\u2019m starting a\
  \ journey of self love where I first begin to love myself and become capable of\
  \ being loved by someone else. Settlement, stability and commitment matter the most\
  \ in any kind of relationship and that\u2019s all I look in a relationship because\
  \ I\u2019ve realised that your love for something or someone might fade away but\
  \ if you\u2019re commited you will take responsibility for it and take care of it\
  \ till your last breath, that\u2019s the reason why commitment is even more attractive\
  \ than a pretty face. Well, I\u2019ve suffered from bulimia and depression and I\u2019\
  m not ashamed of it, instead I want to tell all those people who are suffering from\
  \ these things and worse that they are not alone, we are in together and I promise\
  \ I will try and help every possible person if I can. Embarking on this journey\
  \ I realised that fear is not going to make any better, instead it\u2019s going\
  \ to degrade my confidence and make me feel worse and might also result to my downfall,\
  \ so facing the problems head on and dealing with all the negative emotions that\
  \ surround it is the next mental habit I am practising to develop in order to build\
  \ a strong mental mind which knows it\u2019s limits and acts accordingly based on\
  \ the circumstance and not solely on emotions. Emotions is another core topic which\
  \ I will talk about now and here I\u2019m not talking about sensitive people being\
  \ weak because they feel too much and I am one of them, instead I would like to\
  \ create a change in the mindset of people that becoming strong minded involves\
  \ deep connection with your emotions and what makes you strong is how you handle\
  \ those emotions, just shutting them away is going to cause you more pain and in\
  \ the end it\u2019s going to destroy you. If you choose to destroy yourself then\
  \ keep accumulating those emotions and behave like the living dead but if you want\
  \ to be mentally strong then feel those emotions, accept them and handle them. All\
  \ these things I learnt are due to the various experiences I\u2019ve had so far,\
  \ maybe I\u2019m too young but I know I\u2019m wise enough to not repeat any of\
  \ those mistakes again which I made in the past, lastly I just want to share the\
  \ most beautiful part of this journey and that is letting go of all the toxic people\
  \ in my life past two years, yes two years I\u2019ve been dealing with toxicity\
  \ and I finally let go of it this year because, yes, I realised how worthy I am\
  \ of pure and real love and that I\u2019m a beautiful human being"
