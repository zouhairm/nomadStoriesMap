Text: "Istanbul.\n\nIn truth \u2013 I didn\u2019t expect to find her. \n\nWhen someone\
  \ says, \u201COh, you\u2019re going to Istanbul, you need to meet this person \u2013\
  \ and give them something for me\u2026\u201D, you know right away that your hopes\
  \ of meeting said person are 50/50 at best.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like, \u201COh,\
  \ you\u2019re from ________ -- do you know ________!?\u201D\n\nIstanbul was big.\
  \  For two weeks, I was headed there for a job from Singapore with a few restauranteurs\
  \ whose investments (which included me) were spread between Singapore and Hong Kong\
  \ \u2013 to eat as much as humanly possible. They\u2019d hired me to do Japanese\
  \ in Bali, but the property that they were looking at there fell through \u2013\
  \ so their runner-up idea was doing a Turkish restaurant in Singapore.\n\nFor many\
  \ reasons, including why we were hesitant to go \u2013 bombings that had taken place\
  \ a week before we\u2019d booked our tickets \u2013 Turkey has been late to the\
  \ table of celebrity chef culture, despite it having perhaps the most culturally\
  \ delicious food history on Earth. The restauranteurs that I was working for knew\
  \ this better than I did. The Chef with them \u2013 that was me. Coming up, no one\
  \ had given a shit about who I was or what I could cook \u2013 celebrity chef culture\
  \ had changed the world, and I had come to know what it was to be treated favourably.\n\
  \nThe perks, the insights, the attracted characters, of the life of a Chef \u2013\
  \ balanced out the rest.\n\nThe woman that I was tracked down was named Nilay Irdonmez,\
  \ and, frankly \u2013 this guy who I was playing courier for, must have meant something\
  \ deeply to her. She was gorgeous, funny, daring, and \u2013 what I didn\u2019t\
  \ know at the time \u2013 a rising star in the Turkish film arena.\n\nIt was an\
  \ amulet, what I mule\u2019d \u2013 one he\u2019d acquired in India. It was simple,\
  \ and meaningful, on top of being a thought \u2013 one he\u2019d had of her, in\
  \ a far away land, after meeting her and falling in love.\n\nThey both knew: him\
  \ being a Philadelphia filmmaker on a mission that he might not want to survive,\
  \ and her being a left-leaning film star bound to a country in right-wing tumult,\
  \ that there was no future for them outside of ephemeral romantic memory and a palm-sized\
  \ amulet for memory\u2019s sake. Who knows? Me? Unlikely Canadian courier \u2013\
  \ with a smile. \n\nWe met in a hill atop Karakoy, under the Galata Tower. Reluctantly,\
  \ I threw politics forward, subtly inquiring her feeling of personal safety in the\
  \ city (meaning: I was trying to feel safe, not with her but with Istanbul). \n\n\
  \u201CIt\u2019s Ramadan\u201D, she said \u2013 \u201Cyou picked a good time to come,\
  \ but, enjoy, because this could be the last of the good times. No one will do anything\
  \ until Ramadan ends.\u201D\n\nTurkish Coffee from hot sand and mussels with a squeeze\
  \ of sun-kissed lemon built common ground for us. She clutched the amulet the whole\
  \ day, and \u2013 when we\u2019d broken down barriers \u2013 she told me that she\u2019\
  d take me on a tour if I met her at stall #51 in the Uzcular Baharat the next day\
  \ at noon. So, I did \u2013 and it made all the difference.\n\nLooking back, missing\
  \ the 2016 bombing of Ataturk Airport by 48 hours \u2013 I\u2019d go again. \n\n\
  If we stop going out, looking people in the eye and shaking hands \u2013 that\u2019\
  s when we should fear travelling, both inner and outer. \n\nBefore that \u2013 one\
  \ should fear nothing, and eat adventurously but compassionately.\n\nKarakoy. Ortokoy.\
  \ Istiklal. Turkish ________ (Delight, Massages, Bath Houses). The Aya Sophia. The\
  \ Blue Mosque. Medusa\u2019s head. Soho House.\n\nAsia meets Europe atop Mikla.\
  \ The Silk Road. 21 Grand Bazaar entrances. Flying lamps over the Bosphorous when\
  \ dusk cools old stone.\n\nAnatolia \u2013 what\u2019s left? United, to be divided\
  \ again. Constantinople. What did it mean to me? \n\nKebab. Kokorec. Manti. Yoghurt.\
  \ Turbot. Medya. Dolma. Menemen. Borek. Lahmacun. Baklava. Durum. Kibbeh. Kibbeh\
  \ Naya. Raki.\n\n\u201CA Chef is a historian, a library keeper \u2013 not a celebrity.\u201D\
  \ Nilay understood.\n\n\u201CYou are the bravest library keeper I\u2019ve met\u201D\
  , she laughed.  \n\nMore than any eyes can stand the sight of. More than any belly\
  \ can fit. \n\nMore stories than there is time for.\n\nA place by many names."
