Text: "Exploring every moment of my life takes me to a level where I can enjoy my\
  \ life. From my childhood, I long for experiences for adventure in life. I have\
  \ been going to new places and same places with different companions every year\
  \ to get the essence of the journey. This time I went to Nepal with two of my friends\
  \ whom I met last year. This trip was a road trip from Varanasi, India to Pokhara,\
  \ Nepal via Chitwan, Nepal and further to remote areas in Western Nepal, to understand\
  \ their ways of living.\n\nWe started from Varanasi, India. In last three decades\
  \ I have visited this place once every decade. I read that it illuminate the truth\
  \ and reveal the reality to those who want to understand your origin. Till now I\
  \ couldn't see its wonders in the scope of my vision, but my skills enables me to\
  \ see what has always been there. It\u2019s the root of the Indian Hindu culture.\
  \ We had a day to explore that part, so starting with food, we went to local lassi\
  \ place, called Bana Lassi. With 80s country music, Australian and German companions,\
  \ we tried out North Indian Cuisine in East Indian way. I took my friends through\
  \ the narrow to the narrowest lans for shopping and other places to check out. In\
  \ the evening we watched the auspicious puja takes place at the Dasaswamedh Ghat\
  \ of river Ganges.\nNext night we had to leave for Indo-Nepal Senauli border via\
  \ Gorakpur. We to a train to Gorakpur and then a local share jeep. It was  Still\
  \ 30kms to reach Senauli Border (via Gorakhpur to Chitwan) ... but Nepali version\
  \ of lifeboy radio commercial already was making me feel like I am in Nepal.\nBy\
  \ the time we arrived at Chitwan it was late evening. Next day we headed for the\
  \ elephant breeding center and Chitwan National Park. We wanted to know more about\
  \ elephants because from somewhere we came to know about the usage of Elephant dung\
  \ for making of various usable items like diaries and hand made bags and photo frames.\
  \ Trying to explore out the whereabouts of breeding center we came near a river\
  \ and saw two elephants taking bath and they are helped by the local guards of the\
  \ breeding center. It was additional in our list to get a sight of this. My friend\
  \ also wanted to shower and ride the elephants while taking bath. It was a dream\
  \ come true for him.\n\nWorld is open road, that never ends. My attempt to go at\
  \ the end of the road makes me wander aimlessly. In their aimlessness I find the\
  \ reason to wander and wonder."
