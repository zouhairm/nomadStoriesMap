Text: "From the experience I\u2019d from different tourist about travelling to Mombasa,\
  \ it sound like travelling long distance like nomads who are looking for green pasture\
  \ and water for their animals or running marathon. I was afraid to travel such long\
  \ distance but wanted to try out new things. Early Tuesday morning I board SGR train\
  \ which was from Syokimau to Miritini. It was my first experience to travel in a\
  \ modern train here in Kenya. Talking about their service is like famous hotel around\
  \ whereby you are given even WI FI to enjoy yourself. On my way I meet one of my\
  \ old primary friend who is one of the hostess which I didn't expect because since\
  \ we were young she was poor in languages so I wonder how she got there but in Kenya\
  \ corruption is obvious. I didn't want to ask her how since she was in front of\
  \ her customer and that way I will be embracing her. Leave all that behind, the\
  \ train was approaching to his destination in miritini which was not my destination.\
  \ The town is full of tuk tuk, matatus and motorbike ready to take you anywhere\
  \ you need. Meeting different religion was a nice experience. The most difficult\
  \ thing was to adapt the Swahili culture and language which everyone in town is\
  \ proud of. I visited the nearby town in miritini whereby the product are so cheap\
  \ to purchase. While in the town I come across the Makonde community who were searching\
  \ the material for carving. I come across one of them but their mother tongue was\
  \ so difficult looking anyone to translate for me.The Makonde are community here\
  \ in Kenya who have preserve their tradition and culture from generation to generation\
  \ until to today. They told me that, according to their tradition and economic activity\
  \ they do focus on carving and farming since their land is fertile, interesting\
  \ thing about them is how they have kept their traditions. No one can break it and\
  \ if you break you will be chased away from community is like taboo to them. Seeing\
  \ the mode of dressing it remind me of Nigeria movies and somehow Masai culture\
  \ but today they dress like normal people ,interacting with such community was a\
  \ nice experience in Mombasa. Going back to hotel where my home is for few days,\
  \ I meet the oldest watchman at Fort Jesus gate, he was nearly to be blind due to\
  \ his age, He has been guarding the place for 40 years now looking to retire. The\
  \ challenges are worse since the whole night is guarding forgetting he is old enough,\
  \ \u201CBeing a watchman at fort Jesus since is a historical site, has more challenges,\
  \ people around it are thieves whereby they come at night to rob those historical\
  \ products, my suggestion is that the government should add more cops to guide the\
  \ place during night and day, is not a cheap job to be a watchman in such important\
  \ areas\u201D. When I was about to sleep, I\u2019d drum beating and people singing\
  \ traditional songs whereby I just watch them on television, being curious, rushed\
  \ out to watch . I didn\u2019t expect to watch the Swahili culture performing since\
  \ in Nairobi you do pay to watch such activities. I ate Swahili food which was my\
  \ first time to eat such food, for me it was like a party but to them is usual food\
  \ they cook for their audience and those who appreciate their work. Swahili are\
  \ the most wonderful people to mingle or work with, they just give you a humble\
  \ time to work with them. After the activity I went back to sleep. The new day I\
  \ visited the beach boys who are known to teach people how to swim but many people\
  \ address them like cone men. From their experience they told me that, most of the\
  \ people do take advantage, some rape them others don\u2019t pay them and even threaten\
  \ them that if they expose their image they will be killed. \u201C I was infected\
  \ by one of the swimmer ,she rapped me and run away\u201D government should action\
  \ , The experience in coast is very cool."
