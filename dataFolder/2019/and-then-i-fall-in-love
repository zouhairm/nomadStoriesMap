Text: "Leaving Pakistan wasn't easy. Thinking of a place not so much good reputed\
  \ in that part of the world was a nightmare. It was December, very cold evening\
  \ and snow painted the streets white. It was my third week in the country and I\
  \ already started missing my home. A roommate from China, who wasn't new there forced\
  \ me to visit the Christmas market with him. I haven't been to a Christmas market\
  \ before and I wasn't aware what it is. We took a bus and left for the Christmas\
  \ matket. The drowning sun, snowy roads and silent passengers in the bus taught\
  \ me so much about the German culture. After 5 bus stops, we reached the market.\
  \ My sad face expressions changed into happy one. I couldn't understand why the\
  \ Christmas market made me so happy. Soon I realised, it reminded me of my childhood\
  \ movie Home alone and i was enjoying every bit of thag evening. Grills around,\
  \ warm clothes and wears stalls, nuts grills and so mamy musoc bands at different\
  \ corners of the market made it so special. The lights, the stalls designs and the\
  \ authenticity of the people were so special. Everything were so happy. I could\
  \ see the lights od the markets were extra lighted and the wood house shaped stalls\
  \ and shops were as like smiling. \nAfter walking a bit, we reached the city Center,\
  \ which have a statue of a teenage girl, holding a flower bucket in one hand while\
  \ a bird in other. Mu roommate told me, one come with a wooden wagan here with so\
  \ many friends and bring flowers and kiss this statue of the girl after completing\
  \ a PhD degree. This statue called Gaensalisel and is a symbol of education jn the\
  \ city.\nRoght behind that statue, there is a 300 years old buolding of the social,\
  \ which has been now turned into a tourist information center. This building also\
  \ has a small museum where one can see so many old pics of the city. \nWe soend\
  \ so many hours and left for the hostel very late, almost at closing time. That\
  \ night I saw so much about Germany and my city. I for the first time felt, as Germany\
  \ officially has welcomed me.It was my first love in Germany and first week in Goettingen."
