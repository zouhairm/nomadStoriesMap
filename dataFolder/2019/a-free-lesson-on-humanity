Text: "Near the carcass of an old building sits a small bespectacled Japanese man\
  \ in cycling shorts with a sign in front of him that reads: \u201CFree origami lesson\u201D\
  .\n\nComing from South Africa, we\u2019re pretty sceptical about the word \u201C\
  free\u201D. Despite our reservations, we park our bikes and take our seats on tiny\
  \ dark-green folding chairs next to an iconic ruin, the Genbaku or Atomic Dome.\
  \ It's not the first time we've felt like clumsy giants in a dainty world while\
  \ visiting Japan.\n\nYamaguchi Seiji greets us with a smile and holds out an array\
  \ of patterned paper for us to choose from. I carefully choose a white square with\
  \ colourful polka-dots and my best friend Robyn decides on a purple square with\
  \ cats on it. We sit in the shade of big, beautiful trees, their green shines brilliantly\
  \ against the grey overcast sky. It\u2019s almost impossible to imagine the heat,\
  \ fear, and destruction that happened here when an atomic bomb was dropped just\
  \ over 70 years ago, instantly killing 80 000 people.\n\nYamaguchi-san starts to\
  \ show us how to fold 'orizuru' (paper cranes) with the patience of a natural-born\
  \ Sensei who can teach the unteachable. He meticulously folds the paper again and\
  \ again. It\u2019s like magic happening right in front of our eyes. He\u2019s cheerful\
  \ and sweet, but behind him looms the eerie Atomic Dome, the metal skeleton of the\
  \ only building left standing after the first use of an atomic bomb on civilians.\
  \ The building has been maintained in its ruined state ever since, as a reminder\
  \ of the destruction humanity is capable of. Standing next to the serene Motoyasu\
  \ River, it\u2019s the only hint on the landscape of this city\u2019s tragic past.\n\
  \nYamaguchi-san\u2019s has soft, friendly eyes that light up behind his metal-rimmed\
  \ glasses as he teaches. His nimble fingers keep working and folding until we each\
  \ have a paper crane in hand. His looks perfect, ours looks like they have possibly\
  \ flown through a rainstorm. He shows us where to tug so they flap their wings like\
  \ real birds. He is excited by our enthusiasm and vice versa. He reaches for a decorated\
  \ shoe box and we think: \u201COh no, this is it\u201D. This is the moment he is\
  \ going to ask for money or a \u201Cdonation\u201D or try to sell us something we\
  \ won\u2019t be able to refuse.\n\nInstead, he takes out a red flamingo, a yellow\
  \ ostrich, and a miniature crane the size of a teardrop. He can make them all he\
  \ explains with a heavy Japanese accent. As we sit in awe, he tells us of his childhood,\
  \ other survivors, and life after the tragedy of the atomic bomb. 'Senbazuru' is\
  \ a chain of 1000 paper cranes he explains. When people would get sick from the\
  \ radiation after the blast, many family members and school children would make\
  \ chains of paper cranes to wish them a speedy recovery. Sometimes it would work,\
  \ sometimes it wouldn\u2019t, he adds sadly.\n\nHe says he cycles every day and\
  \ he certainly looks like it. He has his cycling uniform on and he\u2019s short\
  \ but strong. He has a slight tan and although he speaks with the wisdom of an old\
  \ man, it's impossible to say how old he really is. In Hiroshima, survivors are\
  \ passing on their stories of the atomic bomb to the younger generation to ensure\
  \ that they are not forgotten. Just a few minutes away a flame has been burning\
  \ continuously since 1964. It will burn until every nuclear weapon is destroyed.\n\
  \nWe carefully place our paper cranes in our wallets, our most prized gifts. Hiroshima\
  \ has a way of stirring up emotions like no other place on earth. The Hiroshima\
  \ Peace Memorial Park evokes sadness, disbelief, shock and outrage, yet the people\
  \ like Yamaguchi-san who give up their time to make a connection with a stranger\
  \ bring so much joy and lightness.\n\nThe city will not be remembered for being\
  \ destroyed, it will be remembered for being rebuilt and for showing the world that\
  \ the future must be nuclear-weapon-free."
