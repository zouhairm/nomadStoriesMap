Text: "The water was bone-chillingly, why-did-I-jump-off-that-boat, can\u2019t-feel-my-legs\
  \ freezing. For a moment, submerged in greenish Ha Long Bay, Vietnam, there was\
  \ only the sudden silence and the stillness of deep water and the why-why-why.\n\
  \n\u201CWoooooo!\u201D And then I resurfaced to reality. I blinked the shock away\
  \ and turned towards the cheering of my temporary travel buddies, the only four\
  \ other people in the 40-passenger cruise who had thought swimming in a gray January\
  \ afternoon was a bright idea. My brother floated closest to me, laughing and asking\
  \ repeatedly, \u201C\xBFEst\xE1s bien?\u201D\n\nI coughed out a mirroring laugh\
  \ and replied. Yeah, I was okay. \n\nI don\u2019t know how I found myself on a romantic\
  \ cruise in Vietnam with my younger brother, hanging out with a group of three loud\
  \ Spanish guys who didn\u2019t quite know what they were doing there either, but\
  \ I do know it hadn\u2019t started with my okay-ness. \n\nThough I had often day-dreamed\
  \ about sailing among the thousands of islets in Ha Long Bay, taking wonderful pictures\
  \ and eating bun and pho, I never thought I would be pushed half a world away from\
  \ my home in Mexico by a broken heart. But grieving a failed relationship, the loss\
  \ of a beloved friend, the stagnation of my professional goals, and the frustration\
  \ of chronic pain, Vietnam seemed as good a place as any to be lost and anchorless\
  \ in.\n\nAnd so, anchorless, dog paddling in circles, I brushed the hair out of\
  \ my face and thought: I am swimming in Vietnam in freezing water and I am so sad\
  \ and I am so happy and this place is beautiful and I must get out of this water\
  \ right now.   \n\nI climbed the boat\u2019s rusty ladder and wrapped myself up\
  \ in a towel, still shivering as I watched my brother and our new friends lapping\
  \ below me, and wondered what had pushed them. I wondered if, for them, who laughed\
  \ and cursed happily and nagged each other to take the perfect photo for their Facebooks\
  \ and WhatsApps, this trip was indeed not about the limestone mountains and the\
  \ Make the Perfect Spring Roll cooking demonstration and the local beer, as it wasn\u2019\
  t for me. I wondered what they had thought about when they cannonballed into the\
  \ slightly-littered water and heard themselves think why-why-why. \n\nWhatever answers\
  \ echoed in their minds, I was suddenly certain of my own. \n\nI had dived into\
  \ the water to find out what I was doing here. Here, where I could bask in the freedom\
  \ of being surrounded by strangers and soak myself with the wonder of saying \u2018\
  yes\u2019 to myself. Here, where I could feel the opportunity in my lack of direction,\
  \ and the full weight of the loneliness and greatness of my individuality, both\
  \ pulling me down into the deepness of the bay and pushing me back out into the\
  \ crisp air."
