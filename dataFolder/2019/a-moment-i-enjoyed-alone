Text: "\u201CAre you truly happy in your own company or do you constantly seek out\
  \ the company of others to fill that void? Do you find yourself constantly reaching\
  \ out to friends or romantic interests to avoid having any moments alone? We must\
  \ find contentment and be glad to have moments to and by ourselves in order to achieve\
  \ complete peace within.\u201D My yoga instructor soothed as we were about to enter\
  \ shavasana to seal our practice for the day. The thought really dawned on me and\
  \ made me reflect on how I changed throughout the years in relation to my feelings\
  \ towards spending time alone. \n\nUp until last year, I absolutely despised eating\
  \ alone in restaurants. To me, it was a sign of failure; a person so pathetic that\
  \ she cannot find anyone to accompany herself for a meal. Prior to this gentle reminder\
  \ from my yoga teacher, I had not been consciously aware that this particular irrational\
  \ thought of mine had shifted. As I reflected some more, I was reminded of a specific\
  \ moment a few week ago of my trip to Switzerland, a moment that I enjoyed alone.\
  \ \n\nMy last day in the neutral country with green pastures and spotted cows was\
  \ spent alone since my friend Chloe had return to work early. Since I was alone,\
  \ I decided to treat myself by booking a reservation at Le Dezaley, a 116-year old\
  \ fondue establishment that boasts with romantic ambiance in the Old Town neighborhood\
  \ of Zurich. I was having a date with myself.\n\nUpon my arrival, I was led by a\
  \ plump middle-aged man through a corridor that looked like a fancy wine cellar\
  \ in the basement of some bougie Italian villa. He situated me at a table on the\
  \ right side, which appeared to have many sections throughout. Sipping on my white\
  \ wine that tasted like bursts of wild flowers with each sip, I finally made the\
  \ decision to order the fondue special that came with a plate of local Swiss charcuterie\
  \ and a fruit cup as dessert. Fantastic choice! (Okay, this is probably a good place\
  \ to mention that I had a suspicion for about three months already that I have developed\
  \ what appeared to be lactose intolerant symptoms\u2014mild, but still existent.\
  \ But I was determined to not let that ruin my meal! In addition, I adored cheese!\
  \ As a result, I decided to roll the dice and test my luck. Turns out, it was a\
  \ great meal but I am indeed lactose intolerant and let\u2019s just say the plane\
  \ ride back to NYC early next morning was not pleasant due to the fact I had to\
  \ run to the restroom on the plane three times to vomit. But let\u2019s not dwell\
  \ on this minor detail.)\n\nWhile I enjoyed my excellent fondue meal made from a\
  \ secret family recipe, I had a nice long conversation with my jolly plump waiter.\
  \ I learned that he moved to Zurich from a small northern coastal town in Portugal\
  \ in search of better work opportunities in hospitality 35 years ago and has been\
  \ living in Zurich since. It was through conversations with him that I was able\
  \ to get a bit more insight into the Swiss society. \n\n\u201CI love Switzerland!\
  \ Especially Zurich!\u201D He declared. Reasons that backed up his affection were\
  \ its central location, good benefits, and better employment opportunities compared\
  \ to his home country of Portugal. \n\nAfter chatting for awhile, my Portuguese\
  \ Swiss waiter decided to leave me alone while I enjoyed the last few moments in\
  \ the restaurant. My fondue date with myself concluded with a refreshing fruit cup,\
  \ a perfect natural sweet ending to my last night in Switzerland. I bid everyone\
  \ at the restaurant farewell and stepped out into the cold damp April night. I did\
  \ not have an umbrella and the streets of Zurich were quiet. The yellow lights flickered\
  \ in the dark, reflecting upon the wet cobble stone streets of this old yet modern\
  \ city. Breathing in the damp but refreshing air, I felt a gentle curve of a smile\
  \ up my face, commemorating this magical moment. A moment that I enjoyed alone."
