Text: "\u201CIn my entire life, I worked on myself and when I look inside I see pieces.\
  \ I am not whole so I am rearranging whatever I have to give it to you.\u201D One\
  \ of the rough lines I had written in my diary, the fair work of which I had gifted\
  \ to a loved-one along with a girl made out of the cuttings of all the paintings\
  \ I had ever made. I came across it on the airport where I was waiting to board\
  \ a plane to Meghalaya. My sister was taking me to this north-eastern state in India\
  \ for 15 days to get over the heartbreak of losing myself along with the loved-one\
  \ when he decided to leave. \u2018No more looking back.\u2019 I said. \u2018Out\
  \ of sight, out of mind\u2019 I chanted.\nMeghalaya, Sanskrit for \u2018Abode of\
  \ clouds\u2019 or in a more literal sense \u2018where clouds rest\u2019, was the\
  \ perfect place to put the world out of sight. I had been to northeast of India\
  \ before and I had seen clouds move next to us, and when on a hill, under us. But\
  \ this time, I was hanging out with them. With a plan not more elaborate than landing\
  \ in the capital of the state and figuring it out from there, we embarked on our\
  \ journey. \nFirst thing we did after that is leave for the small towns, pictures\
  \ of which had compelled her to book tickets for this state. But how? Let\u2019\
  s see.. We could book a taxi, an auto-rickshaw or a bus. We walked around the city,\
  \ trying to figure out how to go about it. I was wondering \u2018What if we rent\
  \ a car?\u2019. But it was difficult for multiple reasons. It was a budget trip\
  \ and I didn\u2019t know if my sister would be willing to shell such money. But\
  \ more importantly, I did not know how to drive and my sister had only recently\
  \ learned and we had to drive in ghats. Ghats, in India, are roads that go around\
  \ a hill to travel to towns and cities around/on the hills and so the roads are\
  \ narrow, curvy and sometimes steep. They are also parallel to the valley between\
  \ hills. A little miscalculated turn could tip us over into the valley but the clouds\
  \ veiled the view. \u2018Out of sight, out of mind.\u2019 I said and off we went\
  \ to rent a car.\nWe drove in the clouds till they became fog. We walked with local\
  \ guides, heard their stories, heard them sing as they rowed us from the gushing\
  \ streams coming directly from the Himalayas to places with clear still water, we\
  \ saw live root-bridges in the jungles. We went to beautiful towns, not bigger than\
  \ 2 community parks in a city, had traditional food, tried to understand how its\
  \ made. There was water, there was green, there were home-made homes and there always\
  \ was maggie. When, at the end of our days, we reached our wooden hut-rooms after\
  \ walking past hundreds of trees and over streams and we lay in bed, we could hear\
  \ the birds chirp and the water gush in the streams all night. But more than that,\
  \ the absence of electricity allowed us to hear our own selves, our hearts beat\
  \ and our minds speak. You can never put your mind out of your mind, can you?\n\
  10 days later when we came to a city which was just city enough to have electricity\
  \ and mobile network but also felt like a big park where children played, couples\
  \ loved and people wandered, I felt free, I wasn\u2019t scared, I did not want to\
  \ block the thoughts anymore. So I sat down and started writing a letter to the\
  \ loved-one in the same diary. I told him that I hated him, that I missed him and\
  \ that I loved him but as the fog had to lift so I could watch my favorite TV shows,\
  \ let my father know I was fine and take a warm bath, I had to let him go so I could\
  \ lead my daily life; with the memory of the fog, with the memory of the gone."
