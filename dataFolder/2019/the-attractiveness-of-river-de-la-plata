Text: 'I was traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, on last Desember 2018. It was my
  first time traveled to Argentina and did a very long flight. It took about 28 -
  35 hours flight from my home town, Jakarta, Indonesia. I got bad jetlag not only
  cause of the long flight, but also the defference in air temperature. On that time
  Jakarta was tropic and Buenos Aires was cold.


  Burnos Aires is a very beautiful capital city. Jacaranda trees are grown around
  the city that the trees can changes color to purple on November and December.


  And the stunning one is River De La Plata that is one of the largest river in the
  world. This river are ex sea port that it changed by the government to be a city
  panorama in the central business district. The river is very clean of waste, and
  we can enjoy the river with having steak for lunch or dinner beside river. As we
  know, Argentina is one of the largest beef producer.


  We can eat steak with the difference way in here, that the chef will come to you
  several time bring many kind part of beef steak. He will cut the steak on your plate,
  but you could not to eat all variants beef steak to control your cholesterol.


  When in the morning the river looks beautiful to take a picture here, because the
  skies shaped cotton candies and the jacaranda trees beside river colored purple,
  what a beautiful panorama.'
