Text: "3 souls with different heart statuses- one broken, one disturbed marriage &\
  \ one about to tie a knot floating above the silver mountains reached the blood\
  \ shed-jewel state of India- Jammu and Kashmir. Vulnerable souls traveling for the\
  \ first time in isolation of male influence, we chose Kashmir to embark our journey.\
  \ Right from the airport, we were given strange eyes and made to believe hostile.\
  \ As I was the brain of planning, my heart pounded to the thought from last one\
  \ year I have been manifesting to bathe under snow shower. Did I choose the wrong\
  \ place? Thought bubbles burst as we became conscious of the liberation of traveling\
  \ alone. We headed to the crown of Kashmir i.e Gulmarg. We were hypnotized by the\
  \ pine trees lathered with snow, roads were whitewashed. \n\nMy eyes feel upon a\
  \ soul in a chicken taxi. Between not to mingle with hostile souls & liberation\
  \ to bond up with the strangers, I chose the latter. He hails from nearby state\
  \ & works at the electricity department. He leaves the place when snow bites his\
  \ soul & iced fingers don\u2019t melt. He accompanied till the hotel, protected\
  \ from touts and scored huge concessions for SKI. It was a sheer courtesy. \n\n\
  I came to bare my soul to snowfall but with no sign of female in the area & expected\
  \ heavy snowfall which will trap road for days as claimed by locals, It was a huge\
  \ dilemma my soul craved to chase nature but being responsible, we backtracked the\
  \ next morning until we believed in the law of attraction. \n\nWe were waiting for\
  \ shikara (Rower), near the frozen lake, where we planned to stay. It froze our\
  \ heart but melted at the same time. The entire boat was managed by men of different\
  \ age & belief system. We were apprehensive & terrified due to heads up given against\
  \ notorious Muslims & terrorism engulfed state. We were led to the freezing room\
  \ with no sign of heater added by intermittent power cuts. I stepped out to comfort\
  \ my soul with the view of snow-capped houseboats & faint light illuminating from\
  \ the top of mountain morphing into a star. I video called my mother, who has never\
  \ stepped out of our native place, I was convincing her as to why I want to be a\
  \ traveling soul & apprehensive of getting cremated at the same place as I am born.\
  \ \n\nI was disrupted by an unfamiliar lingo saying- \u201CKashmir is beautiful\
  \ in summer, flowers blooming, ducks wadding, you must visit in summer\u201D. Muktawar,\
  \ a 19-year-old manager with soulful voice & bright smile. Again, should I drop\
  \ my guard or mark my territory? My heart tweaked and he continued. He inquired\
  \ why are we 3 girls traveling alone? To liberate ourselves & family from the belief\
  \ system I guess. He was inquisitive of my take on life after death. I eared his\
  \ fair share of the opinion he continued quoting the Quran; how god will place foot\
  \ again & we will be rumbled to death. He was unapologetic of not reciting namaz\
  \ rather enchanting Allah in his heart. He continued with his anti-polygamy spirit.\
  \ Yawar, the helper, joined us by putting on table how he broke the shackles by\
  \ performing love marriage. How he shoves jobs in metros to lessen the distance\
  \ from her soulmate. Altaaf, the cook, he narrated his dream of working in a restaurant\
  \ in metros. Asgar, the shikara, He defied by not marrying in the same blood as\
  \ per Islamic religion. I was soaking in their vibration, I taught them UNO, they\
  \ were apprehensive about learning it by belittling themselves & how modern the\
  \ game was vis-a-vis cards. I found solace when their eyes glittered by winning.\n\
  \nMy eyes unintentionally pierced through the glass gate. The view was shining armor.\
  \ It felt like snow was inter coursing with the lake water under blurry lights.\
  \ I rushed to the balcony, cotton was showering upon us under the starry night,\
  \ rare in the city. My cheeks went moist due to the epiphany. My Halo effect was\
  \ crushed by meeting Islamic engraved men yet breaking the stereotypes in different\
  \ ways."
