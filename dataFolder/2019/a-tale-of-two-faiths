Text: "I\u2019ve avoided Quiapo, an old district in Manila, for as long as I can remember.\
  \ For a place well known for the iconic Catholic church that housed the supposedly\
  \ miraculous Black Nazarene, it was infamous for destitute and filthy living that\
  \ bred generations of drug dealers, counterfeit goods sellers, sham fortune tellers,\
  \ thieves and thugs, even murderers and recently, terrorists. At least that\u2019\
  s what I\u2019ve been told all my life. \u201CYou want to get robbed and stabbed\
  \ and left dying in pile of rotting vegetables? Go to Quiapo,\u201D people normally\
  \ say. When I was a university student and doing my internship with a newspaper\
  \ near Manila City Hall, I\u2019d pass by Quiapo and cover my nose while inside\
  \ a jeepney or car. Not necessarily because the place reeked, but more out of instinct.\
  \ I\u2019ve long been made to believe it was a trashy place, so it must smell like\
  \ one. \n\nSo it was odd when I found myself willingly visiting Quiapo on a hot\
  \ Saturday morning in mid-February to participate in a tour of the place. My Muslim\
  \ friend and Shari\u2019ah lawyer, Amanah Lao, has partnered with Meaningful Travels\
  \ PH, a social enterprise organizing immersive tour experiences in the Philippines.\
  \ I always promised Amanah I\u2019d go, yet constantly found an excuse not to. But\
  \ since she is more like family to me, I finally relented and decided to support\
  \ her cause. \n\nAs soon as the cab driver dropped me off at the front of The Quiapo\
  \ Church, I held onto my bag like a mother protecting her newborn child. I used\
  \ my mum\u2019s ancient Nokia phone to contact Amanah so as not to attract any muggers\
  \ scouting for fancy iPhones to steal and sell in the black market. My eyes darted\
  \ from one passer by to another, remembering my stepdad\u2019s warning to stay alert.\
  \ I regarded anyone who dared look at me with great suspicion as I talked to my\
  \ friend on the Nokia. \n\n\u201CGo to the other side of Quiapo,\u201D Amanah instructed.\
  \ \u201CFind the mosque with the golden dome.\u201D\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s a mosque\
  \ in here?\u201D I asked, bewildered. My 37 years of ignorance further laid bare\
  \ in one simple conversation, considering The Quiapo Golden Mosque has been standing\
  \ there since 1976.\n\nWhile our country has matured and progressed significantly\
  \ from its warring history between Muslims and Catholics, divisions still exist.\
  \ The Muslim community, as I soon found out from the tour, was just a small one\
  \ on the opposite side of the Quezon Bridge. I walked through a narrow alley shaded\
  \ by a canopy of umbrellas struggling to keep vendors\u2019 tomatoes, cabbages and\
  \ peppers piled up in wooden carts untouched by the scorching sun. \n\nMy thoughts\
  \ skipped from, \u201CAre they going to rob me?\u201D to \u201COh dear God, if I\
  \ get stabbed here I hope my family knows I love them.\u201D None of those happened.\
  \ I arrived to the other side with no open wounds, apart from one mosquito bite\
  \ on my elbow, and with my bones still intact. \n\nDressed in a navy blue long-sleeved\
  \ shirt, black pants and with her head wrapped in peach and pastel blue scarf, Amanah\
  \ hugged me and welcomed me to her community. \u201CAssalamu Alaykum,\u201D she\
  \ said.\n\nThe tour started with a brief history of the Muslim people in the otherwise\
  \ predominantly Catholic Philippines, then Amanah, being a women\u2019s rights advocate,\
  \ opened a short discussion on the need to revise the Muslim law affecting women\
  \ in the country, to expand their rights. I have long held the notion that the Muslim\
  \ faith is oppressive to women. But Amanah said the Quran regards women highly and\
  \ offers provisions to protect them, yet this is obscured by a patriarchal interpretation\
  \ and translation into law.\n\nWe soon walked the outskirts and weaved through the\
  \ pillars of the mosque, marvelled at its okir design and listened to the Arabic\
  \ chanting of the school children learning their prayers in the madrasa. \n\nBefore\
  \ I walked out of there, Quiapo was no longer a seedy and destitute place for me\
  \ to avoid. It is my dear friend\u2019s community and her family, and so it is mine\
  \ too."
