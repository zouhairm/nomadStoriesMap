Text: "\u201CThere\u2019s you before you\u2019ve been to Machu Picchu and then there\u2019\
  s you after. These are two different people,\u201D our Chilean barista in Melbourne\
  \ said to us when my husband and I told him about our upcoming trip to Peru to trek\
  \ the Inca Trail.\nThis was early 2017 and I was turning 30 in July. Having grown\
  \ up in the urban jungle that is New Delhi, I had never been camping or trekking.\
  \ What better way to leap into the unnerving third decade of my life on Earth than\
  \ by hiking the Inca Trail to watch the sun rise over the majestic Machu Picchu,\
  \ right?\n\nSo off we went! With just the faintest idea of what to expect, thanks\
  \ to poring over blogs by other adventurers. Thank god for World Nomad travel insurance!\n\
  \nWhat we were in for was four unforgettable days of hiking through thick Andean\
  \ jungles, climbing up to over 4,000 feet above sea level to something ominously\
  \ titled Dead Woman\u2019s Pass and coming face to face with a rare black llama.\
  \ \n\nIf that's not life-changing enough, then the breathtaking views through the\
  \ rolling clouds, the undulating hills and the refreshing mountain streams and the\
  \ humbling Incan ruins and structures we saw along the way were enough to begin\
  \ the transformation from who I was to who I have become.\n\nThis transformation\
  \ was well and truly complete when I saw the first rays of the sun shine over the\
  \ \u2018Old Mountain\u2019 overlooking the ruins of the city of Machu Picchu. When\
  \ we got closer, we learned that every brick had been laid with precision and resolve,\
  \ each structure had its place and its purpose. \n\nAlmost 700 years on from when\
  \ it was built, and the ancient city was so near intact that when I climbed to a\
  \ vantage point and briefly shut my eyes to take it all in, I could almost see the\
  \ great citadel in all its glory. The vision made me shiver, and beam with pride\
  \ about being infinitesimal part of something this historic and significant.\n\n\
  Machu Picchu signifies the glory of human endeavour."
