Text: "Once upon a time, there was a man named David and one day David received are\
  \ warning, scary enough to heed. In a short time, a great storm would come and a\
  \ flood would follow so great that anything that wasn\u2019t prepared would be destroyed.\
  \ David took the warning to heart and took responsibility for saving as much as\
  \ possible.\nDavid built a huge boat and gathered 2 of as many kinds of animals\
  \ he could find, and the supplies to sustain himself, the animals, and his family,\
  \ and shut the boat. Shortly after, the rains began to fall, lightly at first, then\
  \ more fiercely until water covered everything and no land could be seen.\nNight\
  \ after night, the rains continued to fall, and the storms continued to wait until\
  \ one day they didn\u2019t. David walked out onto the deck surrounding the boat\
  \ beneath the clearing skies, and felt despair. With nothing but ocean as far as\
  \ the eye could see, how long would David, his family, and the restless animals\
  \ be stuck aboard this boat? Did they avoid drowning only to starve or turn on each\
  \ other later? David couldn\u2019t let this happen. He had to find the land.\n\n\
  David went below deck and returned topside with a plan. A dove and a raven. Tomorrow\
  \ morning one of the birds would fly, away from the boat. Hopefully, the bird would\
  \ return with a sign that land was near, within a bird\u2019s flight.\nThe next\
  \ morning David returned to the boat\u2019s deck as the orange sun crested above\
  \ the sea, the dove on one hand, the raven on the other. The raven would go first,\
  \ it knew its purpose. To explore. The raven was proud to be the first, but fearful\
  \ of the possibilities\u2026and the unknown. And with a wave of David\u2019s hand,\
  \ the raven flew, off towards the horizon and the endless ocean.\n\nDavid sat anxiously\
  \ on the deck as he watched the raven fly off, hopeful but uncertain. He waited\
  \ as the sun rose to its highest in the sky and then fell back towards the horizon\
  \ as the colors in the sky returned from blues to orange. He waited anxiously as\
  \ the orange sky gave way to stars in the night, speckled over the sea\u2026but\
  \ the raven didn\u2019t return.\nDavid thought throughout the night, confused. Why\
  \ hadn\u2019t the raven returned? Had it flown so far that it used all of its energy\
  \ and was unable to return? Had it lost its way exploring, only to fall into the\
  \ sea? Had the raven found a paradise, scared that if he returned to the boat, he\
  \ may never find the paradise again? Whatever the reason, it couldn\u2019t possibly\
  \ make sense. David refused to give up\u2026\nAfter the worry, confusion, and angst\
  \ subsided, David returned to the deck of the boat while the sun once again crested\
  \ above the sea. The dove sat on David\u2019s arm, confident in its task. David\
  \ nodded in assurance and waved his arm as the dove flew off on its mission.\nDavid\
  \ once again waited, anxiously, as the sun raced high into the sky and back down\
  \ toward the ocean as the sky returned from blue to hues of orange. Just as the\
  \ sun was about to fall into the sea, the dove returned, exhausted, with no sign\
  \ of land to share. There was land, somewhere out there.\nDays later David returned\
  \ to the deck with the rested and rejuvenated dove. The dove knew its purpose and\
  \ David had faith in it. With a wave of David\u2019s hand the dove flew off toward\
  \ the horizon.\nDavid watched the bird fly away, he waited as the sun rose high\
  \ into the deep sky. David waited as the bluish guy once again gave way to hues\
  \ of orange as the sun fell into the sea. And then finally, the dove returned, exhausted\
  \ again, clutching a tiny twig from a tree with a single leaf\u2026a sign that somewhere\
  \ with a bird\u2019s flight away there was land where plants were growing.\nThere\
  \ was hope. There was something better out there. David, thankful and reassured,\
  \ carried the dove below deck to rest and recover, proud of what it had accomplished."
