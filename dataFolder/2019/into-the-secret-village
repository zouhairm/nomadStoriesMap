Text: "They say we're very close to the secret village when we cross that bamboo bridge.\
  \ Sweat and breath racing to my chest, dampen black t-shirt wrapped my body. It's\
  \ nearly 4 hours we climb the Halimun mountain.   \n\n\"This is it, please switch\
  \ off your camera. We're very close,\" our guide from the secret village politely\
  \ asks us to switch off any kind of camera.\n\nA Japanese girl looks alike stood\
  \ next to me whisper, that when those indigenous people say \"very close\" it's\
  \ mean two to three hills to go.\n\nYeah, we can't trust Baduy people when they\
  \ say something about distance. I mean we don't use our proportions, we use their\
  \ proportions.\n\nAround 2002 is the first time I shook Baduy peoples hands. Since\
  \ then I came back and forth to their place over and over, at least twice a month,\
  \ but not to the secret village, this is my first experience.\n\nBaduy tribe has\
  \ two groups; \"The Inner Baduy\" where they live in the secret village, and the\
  \ \"Outer Baduy\" which is living in the villages surrounding the secret village\
  \ area.\n\nDon't ask me what made me fall for them, you have to experience it by\
  \ yourself. But I can tell you one of those amazing moments;\n\nThere was a day\
  \ when I was so stressed with the city life, I visit someone in Gajeboh Village,\
  \ his name is Musung. Musung has a wife, a son, and a daughter.\n\nHis wife will\
  \ cook for me anytime I visit Gajeboh, off course they will not take the rice from\
  \ their barn called \"Leuit,\" cause rice from \"Leuit\" is only for a special occasion.\
  \ But it feels at home when you achieve those kinds of love.\n\nOne of the greatest\
  \ things I can get in Baduy villages are sleeping on the flattened bamboo floor,\
  \ I can feel the air penetrate the flattened bamboo stroking my body, singing lullabies\
  \ on my ear.\n\nWe know that rivers in Indonesia's cities specially in Jakarta are\
  \ not something your eyes to shot. But there, a place where these indigenous people\
  \ live, river mean pleasure. It's not only that clear water, but it's also mean\
  \ the ancient rule you have to follow, so our children can inherit the exclusive\
  \ joy.\n\nWell, I'm not gonna tell you how many times I saw their beautiful girls\
  \ on that river, cause although they remove every woof on their body we're not allowed\
  \ to stare. We have to walk away.\n\nYes, this is my first experience hiking to\
  \ the secret village after a long relationship with the Baduy people.\n\nMy knees\
  \ trembling, struggling to support my well-heeled body, my lungs burn, asking me\
  \ to stop climbing, but we need to get to our destination before the dark, so I\
  \ push myself to beat the lazy boy in my soul till we met the \"Leuit\", which means\
  \ we're already there; The Secret Village.\n\nWe can see those bamboos and wood\
  \ made architecture, built to store their harvest. You wouldn't believe me if I\
  \ say that they still have their rice saving from 250 years ago, right? But that's\
  \ ok, you don't have to impressed."
