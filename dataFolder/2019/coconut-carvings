Text: "California has experienced some brutal heat waves, but that is no comparison\
  \ to the humidity in Thailand. I stayed in Lom Sak this weekend, still adjusting\
  \ to my recent move, in hopes of getting acquainted with the little country town\
  \ I was going to call home for the next year. Although I was looking forward to\
  \ my weekend ventures, the heat and humidity compelled me to spend most of my time\
  \ in hiding until the blazing sun settled for the day. My accommodation was situated\
  \ right on school grounds, which was built around a beautiful house, so it was quite\
  \ comfortable to stay put. My intention to spend a weekend full of relaxation, however,\
  \ was interrupted by the children enjoying their Saturday morning. I heard kids\
  \ racing around, yelling in those endearing, high-pitched voices during breaks from\
  \ their weekend classes. Amongst the chaos, I could also hear Pa San\u2019Wan working\
  \ in the kitchen right outside of my bedroom. Her only relief from the heat was\
  \ a rotating fan, which was protruding down from the ceiling merely shifting the\
  \ heat around the room. It was one of the hottest weekends of that summer. I made\
  \ an effort to express how bad I felt that Pa had to work on a day like this. Her\
  \ response:  a confused glare, interlaced with a kind giggle and hint of curiosity.\
  \ We shared a laugh over our pleasant, though incomplete, exchange and I rode out\
  \ on my bicycle into town. I wish I could have done more to ensure she got a break\
  \ on her Saturday, but the piercing heat from the sun on my skin distracted me enough\
  \ to forget the sympathy I was feeling for Pa.\n              Pa San\u2019Wan is\
  \ the auntie that works in the kitchen and snack shop at our school where I teach\
  \ English. San\u2019Wan is her name,and we respectfully add \u201CPa\u201D to the\
  \ front of her name to refer to her as an aunt. During my time here we have exchanged\
  \ a handful of pleasantries, but as she does not speak a word of English, and my\
  \ Thai is quite limited, we were never able to fully understand each other.  But\
  \ despite the language barrier, this woman still managed to secure a cozy spot in\
  \ my heart.\nAfter I had left our school campus, I passed by the cold drinks cart\
  \ around the corner and couldn\u2019t resist stopping for a refreshing cup of coconut\
  \ water. My favorite part is always eating the pieces of real coconut carvings piled\
  \ on top of each other over the chunks of ice. The heat was so intense, the cup\
  \ was instantly sweating a puddle of condensation into my hands as the ice dissolved.\
  \ To enjoy my cold treat, I rushed back to school before the heat was able to completely\
  \  warm it up. As I got closer to my room I realized Pa San\u2019Wan was still working\
  \ in this dreadful heat, but I had only bought one drink. I proceeded into the kitchen\
  \ and gestured the cup towards her; letting my body communicate that the beverage\
  \ was for her. Her clothes wrinkled and posture slumped as she slid her feet across\
  \ the kitchen floor with a broom and dustpan in her hands. Wiping the sweat off\
  \ of her forehead, her face lit up, she straightened her back, and worked up the\
  \ energy to say, \u201Ckap khun kaa Teacher.\u201D Her sweet \u201Cthank you\u201D\
  \ was heartwarming enough to quench my thirst and giving up my only cup of coconut\
  \ water felt like a small sacrifice.  She then asked me a question in Thai. Unfortunately\
  \ I didn\u2019t understand, but she made sure to get my answer to her question before\
  \ the end of the day. Teacher Jero walked in, and with the eagerness of a child,\
  \ she asked him where I bought the drink. I guess it was that good.\nThe following\
  \ Saturday I heard a gentle knocking on my bedroom door. \u201CTeachuhh\u2026?\u201D\
  \ Pa never knocks on my door\u2026 I quickly jumped up and opened the door to find\
  \ a cup holder dangling with coconut water and my favorite coconut carvings on top."
