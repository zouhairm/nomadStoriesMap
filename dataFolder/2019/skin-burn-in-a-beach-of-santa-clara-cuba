  \ every moment of vacation and taking pictures with your in a stunning place of\
  \ the world will historical momentum of our life. \n\nIn December of 2015 my family\
  \ and I had a five days travel to Cuba. Although we enjoyed a lot from the place\
  \ where our resort was I burnt my skin in beach on the first day and the pain and\
  \ blisters started on second day. That pain was trying to ruin my vacation and I\
  \ struggled to fight with it specially when I was going to bed it hurt me. That\
  \ pain made me not to sleep but go out and enjoy more from out door dance clubs,\
  \ bars, shows and many other things were happening during the nights.\nMoreover,\
  \ my family and I could share the happiness and the moment better than the sleeping.\
  \ \nFurthermore we have taken thousands of pictures and videos. Those pictures and\
  \ videos always reminds us from the nicest time we had in Cuba. \nTravelling to\
  \ a safe place anywhere around the world will always stick with happy moments with\
  \ our loved ones and nothing can avoid us from being happy. Like I had skin pain\
  \ due to too much sleeping in the sun but I was happily enjoying that five days\
  \ with my kids and my wife."
