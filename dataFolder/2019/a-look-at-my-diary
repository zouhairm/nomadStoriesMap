Text: "A look on my diaries\n\n\n\nEgypt - 2008 - new job\nI am really excited about\
  \ my new job as professor of Spanish. Alejandro, the new professor who came from\
  \ Spain to teach Spanish, Portuguese, Italian is really ... invading. Of course,\
  \ I am not in love with him and I\u2019ll never do, but he has a strange ability\
  \ to penetrate through my inner world as nobody has ever done.\n\nAfter an exhausting\
  \ day, at 9 p.m., everybody had just left, he asked: would you like to have a walk?\n\
  \nWe walked...slowly, as watching the city for first time, it was my first time\
  \ to feel this...this breath, these beats. I saw sparkles everywhere. After walking\
  \ 20 minutes all the Shooting Club Street, we reach the Main Street of Mohandseen\
  \ the zone where he lives.\n\nAlejandro: whats your Philosophy of life?\nMe: (Do\
  \ I tell him that??) - Simply I search for .... balance... Weekly, I ask myself\
  \ if I could achieve balance on physical, mental, spiritual and social level...\
  \ (Alejandro was listening, he kept listening even after I stopped talking...) I\
  \ interrupted the silence: and yours?\nAlejandro: I wish to be universal\n\nWe kept\
  \ talking about life\n\nIt was 10.45 pm. Arab League street was vividly full of\
  \ lights and lots of people on the pavement. Every group is by his own, but we are\
  \ all here together. Even if you walk alone, you feel accompanied. Human vibes surround\
  \ me. I don\u2019t think I can localize this feeling anywhere around the world.\n\
  \n\nSpain - 2013 - Honeymoon\n\nAlejandro: I really wish we can find tickets? Aren\u2019\
  t you exited??\nMe: Actually, I am more surprised that bullfight is conserved till\
  \ the 21st century.\n\nWe took the metro till Las Ventas Station. People were more\
  \ animated ... accelerated and excited. Many of them hold something in hand like...\
  \ a suite case.\nAlejandro: Look, these two men are going there. \nMe: How do you\
  \ know that? (He just points to a suitcase they hold in hand)\nAlejandro: Excuse\
  \ me, where can I buy the tickets of the Bullfight?\nThe old man: we are going there,\
  \ you can join us...\nWe followed them...and arrived in two minutes\nThe man: You\
  \ can reserve tickets here\nIt seemed like an ancient square from the 15th century,\
  \ I can\u2019t believe I am seeing such antique. \nMe: Can you take a picture of\
  \ us?\nThe man: (Smiley) of course\nThe man: now, now .... here it is\nMe: Can I\
  \ take a photo of you with my husband?\nThe man: (delighted) of course\nMe: thank\
  \ you so much... (The man has gone, I took the camera to have a look at the picture\
  \ he took for us) -Hahahahaha, Alejandro, You are beheaded... look at the photo....\
  \ (I couldn\u2019t stop laughing)\n\nWhile Alejandro was reserving tickets, I kept\
  \ looking at the Bullring. I would have missed a lot if I haven\u2019t seen this\
  \ once in my life. San Isidro Bullring is a huge rounded installation. Sun rays\
  \ penetrated through gigantic browned red stones. To reach our seats, we went in\
  \ a circular corridor, searching for the right entrance letter. Ohhhh... Cushions\
  \ for rent! The suitcases ... They are actually portable seat cushions!...\nAlejandro:\
  \ here is our entrance...\nGetting in..... It\u2019s like getting in a time machine...\
  \ old Bullring, enormous sky, thousands of seats with exited audience awaiting the\
  \ resolution of the eternal conflict between mankind and animal power. Bullring\
  \ vibes swallowed my own vibes. Alejandro said: here are our seats....look who is\
  \ there! I thought it was going to be somebody from Egypt .... but, simply, it is\
  \ the old man, the one who has just beheaded my husband out there. I started to\
  \ laugh again. He was setting over his portable cushion and talking vividly with\
  \ his friends about today\u2019s bullfighters. I immediately got closer and said\
  \ \u201Chi\u201D as meeting with a friend. He was not surprised...he said: have\
  \ a seat, and then I can make you another photo. I responded: ohhhhhh, I\u2019d\
  \ really love to.\n\nThe fight starts...\nEvery group is by his own, but we are\
  \ all here together. Even if you are alone, you feel accompanied. Human vibes surround\
  \ me."
