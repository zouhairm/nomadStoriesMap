Text: "The news filtered in as the vintage clock on the wall struck 3:00am on the\
  \ morning of Saturday,16th February. The presidential Election has been postponed\
  \ by a week! I hear my lover Ore shrieking,rousing me from my slumber which has\
  \ barely just begun,as I open my eyelids to gaze at her sitting across me at the\
  \ foot of the king-size bed in our room at the Newcastle hotel we are lodged in.\n\
  \nThis country is a huge joke,and a mess,she says. Why postpone elections on the\
  \ very day it is slated to be done?, a...a..and make an official announcement in\
  \ the dead of night when citizens are asleep?. I could recognize the tone of despair\
  \ and resignation that was her voice.\n\nPulling myself upwards to a sitting position\
  \ and resting my back against the bed\u2019s headboard,my somewhat dazed mind starts\
  \ to focus and recollect the situation at hand. The ruling party and incumbent president\
  \ wants to hold on to power,and aware of impending defeat,will do anything to secure\
  \ victory at all costs. Knowing if they allow the elections to be free and fair,the\
  \ people will vote them out.\n\nI am fully awake now and should be concerned like\
  \ Ore,however I\u2019m numb to anything that happens regarding the country.\nShe\
  \ turns away from her twitter app on her phone to fully face me,as if searching\
  \ for some sort of succor. I can offer her nothing but a blank expression.\nOre\
  \ is visibly shaken and close to tears. She opens her mouth and mutters softly,I\
  \ barely hear the words that come out of her mouth as she says, \u2018they had four\
  \ years to prepare, they were given almost half a billion dollars!. \nI am in awe\
  \ of her passion and belief for a country that feeds on it\u2019s young and best\
  \ minds and chases away the seemingly lucky ones to other places more orderly and\
  \ humane. I marvel at how she,like many other young people of Nigeria can still\
  \ keep hoping so passionately that things will change for the better someday.\n\
  \ I have known Ore for only two days, though it feels like we have known each other\
  \ for a long time. On our first meeting we fit right away. Ore and I met on Thursday\
  \ night at the lounge of the Pearson airport in Toronto while waiting for our flight,she\u2019\
  s seated in the seat closest to mine. I am sitting leg\u2019s crossed and watching\
  \ on my iPad events preceding the elections. She taps me lightly on my finger and\
  \ says with a smile,while looking me in my eyes,who do you suppose is going to be\
  \ president?. The conversation thereafter flows natural and easy,knowing we are\
  \ from the same country,we talk through the trip. By the time we arrive in Nigeria\
  \ we know we want to be together as partners. We walk together through the airport\
  \ greeted by the scorching heat,rolling our luggage while weaving through the crowd\
  \ and past immigration officials,most of them with smiles that solicit some sort\
  \ of monetary remunerations.\nWe both have schedules to keep to and are to fly back\
  \ to Toronto on Sunday right after the elections but now they have been postponed.\n\
  At the hotel she looks at me through her thick glasses and endearing smile I have\
  \ come to adore and asks, Oje what are we to do?.we both know we have to leave so\
  \ we do just that.\n Unlike our home country\u2019s modus operandi, we have to keep\
  \ to our schedule.\nAfter all,the elections weren\u2019t free and fair,the incumbent\
  \ president and his ruling party ensured the army and security apparatus of state\
  \ killed,maimed and systematically disenfranchised the citizens who voted for their\
  \ conscience and only wanted to exercise their right to choose their leader. There\
  \ was massive rigging.\nAlthough we were denied our right to vote,like the many\
  \ other rights that have so often been denied many other citizens like us before,by\
  \ the theatrics and manipulations of strong forces of the system.\nWe can console\
  \ ourselves in the fact that we did our best,we tried to make a good difference\
  \ in our first home. Most importantly we found each other in a new country that\
  \ has provided us a new home.We found love."
