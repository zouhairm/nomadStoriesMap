Text: "After living as a digital nomad for the past 7 months, untethered to my previous\
  \ Los Angeles life, I began to shift my mode oprandi to a more purposeful one.\n\
  While on a visa run to Cambodia from Bali, Indonesia, I made a point to veer off\
  \ the common tourist path to one more sobering. \nAfter visiting the Landmine Museum\
  \ in Siem Reap, run by a former Khmer Rouge child soldier who is now responsible\
  \ for the removal of over 500,000 land mines in Cambodia, I decided to extend my\
  \ skills as a marketer and social media guru to those that were in need of spreading\
  \ awareness for their cause. I spoke with the director of the Landmine Relief Fund,\
  \ offering my skills to help gain digital awareness to the NGO & subsequently obtaining\
  \ grants for their success. Shortly after, I trekked to Phnom Phen to further my\
  \ knowledge of the toll the Khmer Rouge and its regime had on Cambodia and its people\
  \ that still effects daily life, including land mine deaths each year. After realizing\
  \ the lack of resources and funding for the progress of many of these foundations,\
  \ I visited the Cambodian Children\u2019s Fund. Upon my visit, they too had mentioned\
  \ that aftermath of the Khmer Rouge regime left many uneducated families and lack\
  \ of recourses in its wake. Such that it is stunting the progressive education of\
  \ children today. I have traveled to over 11 countries in the past two years and\
  \ over 41 countries in my life. I have been blessed to have been able to do this\
  \ and continue to pursue my global perspective. However, as I continue my journey,\
  \ I find myself with more of a desire to learn culture from the locals, outside\
  \ the grasp of tour guides. I seek knowledge from varied generations in each country\
  \ I visit, probing for answers about their feelings on their culture, government,\
  \ future and past. My greatest source of education has been obtained through my\
  \ travels. My hope is to share my continued experiences as I circumference the globe.\
  \ I have photographed and documented my experiences along the way, sharing to my\
  \ social media as well as my website. I\u2019ve worked with local boards of tourism\
  \ and various organizations, hospitality brands and companies as I journey. In an\
  \ effort to expand the mindset for Travel and encourage purpose in others."
