Text: "It's a tricky balance to strike: how to experience raw culture while travelling\
  \ without causing intrusion. But what code of ethics applies when you're suddenly\
  \ surrounded by it? \n\nA few months ago I visited the Tirta Empul temple in Northern\
  \ Bali, Indonesia. The Hindu temple is famous for its holy water; local Hindus flock\
  \ to the bath for ritual purification and have for generations. The freshwater spring\
  \ which fills the pool was discovered during the Warmadewa dynasty (10-14th centuries).\
  \ \n\nWhile photographing the ritual, snapping my camera like a mad woman, a commotion\
  \ of bells and brass instruments caught my attention. Turning to see what all of\
  \ the noise was about, my jaw dropped. I saw a parade of hundreds in traditional\
  \ dress, men in all white and women in rich colours balancing baskets balanced on\
  \ their heads. The ceremony began so suddenly, it was as if this crowd had teleported\
  \ to the temple. I later learned they were about to celebrate the Galungan holiday,\
  \ a time on the Balinese Hindu calendar when gods and ancestral spirits visit Bali.\
  \ On this day, good triumphs over evil.\n\nThough I was in awe, I also wondered\
  \ whether my obvious tourist identity would be considered intrusive. After all,\
  \ there were hardly any bystanders, other than the two other people I was travelling\
  \ with. I bit my nail, overwhelmed. 'Can we... should we... be here?,' I asked myself.\
  \ However, several approving nods and gracious grins soon ruled out those thoughts.\
  \ Mothers asked if I would photograph their children; an elderly man insisted I\
  \ get blessed.\n\nIt was an eye-opening hour steeped in culture, ritual and prayer.\
  \ It left me without words. I drank in the experience like wine.\n\nThe ceremony\
  \ of prayer ended with blessings from elders. Peppered throughout the crowd were\
  \ men with bowls of water and rice. Those in prayer cupped their hands high to receive\
  \ sprinkles of holy water. \n\nThey finished the benediction by sticking rice to\
  \ their foreheads \u2014 a symbol of rejuvenation balance and the restoration of\
  \ peace on the island of Bali. \n\n*This story originally appeared on my blog and\
