Text: "When you spend your childhood dreaming about travel to new places and then\
  \ it suddenly happens; it feels that you might be living in an alternate reality.\
  \ I have heard that in order to grow, you need to change.  You have to get out of\
  \ your comfort zone and venture yourself into the unknown.  It can be good to try\
  \ new things, different things; to explore new places and new mindsets.  Your world\
  \ gets so much bigger that way and suddenly the word limit loses its power. And\
  \ it is with that spirit that I chose something different or perhaps it chose me,\
  \ who is to say what really happened. \n\nIt was on a cold morning that my journey\
  \ started as I hopped on a car, then a bus and then a plane that would take me to\
  \ my destination. This crazy journey lasted 27 hrs and it was then when I landed\
  \ on the beautiful city of Naples. I was tired, confused and just wanted to take\
  \ a nap; but I still had two more hours on the road. I grabbed my suitcase and all\
  \ the gifts I brought from home and tried to find the bus that would take me to\
  \ the train station. If you know Naples or have been in southern Italy, you are\
  \ well aware that they run on their own schedule and chaos is somehow order within\
  \ the city.  I found the station, purchased a ticket and made my way to the train.\
  \ Then someone yelled \"Sorrento\" and I thought that was my stop, so I went off\
  \ the train and started walking. A few minutes into my journey I realized that there\
  \ was a suspicious man following me and my mind started to panic. You think you\
  \ know what to do in those situations, but when it happens you just freeze. As I\
  \ kept walking as fast as I could, an Italian man started waving his hands at me;\
  \ somehow, I managed to stop and talk to him. He said he would look out for me as\
  \ I walked to the hostel, but the other man was getting closer. At that moment the\
  \ Italian man said I had to ride the vespa with him, so I could be safe. In mind\
  \ I had to options: 1) Possibly be kidnapped by a nice Italian guy and eat pizza\
  \ for life or 2) Say no and hope the other guy wouldn't want to hurt me. Of course,\
  \ I chose the first option and it was then when I realized I was at the wrong town.\
  \ \n\nThe fear and the rush were gone, so Carlo drove back to the train station.\
  \ He told me not to be scared in this kind of situations, since there is always\
  \ someone willing to give you a hand at the right time. That life always has your\
  \ back and Italians too! When I finally arrived in Sorrento after 30hrs of travel,\
  \ I left my bags and decided to explore. I was still shaking from the bad experience,\
  \ but what is life if you don't dare to live it. There I was with courage in one\
  \ hand and adventure in the other.  When I looked more into this town, I realized\
  \ it was a vibrant small city. Nevertheless, despite that unusual welcoming I took\
  \ a leap of faith, just to discover later on that it was one of the best decisions\
  \ I have ever made.  This lovely town takes your breath away from the moment you\
  \ set foot in it. Walking down from the Circumvesuviana (the train station), which\
  \ takes you into cute little alleys to the best ocean views. You start to wonder\
  \ what life might be like or if you\u2019ll ever get bored after visiting all the\
  \ attractions. The answer is no! Sorrento is the place that stays with you no matter\
  \ how far you go.  A town so charming that it will leave you wanting to come back\
  \ for more. More adventures, more gelato, more love, more life; well you get the\
  \ idea! \n\nI was lost, but I found myself and maybe a new place with no set of\
  \ directions asking me to stay."
