Text: "Culture and history, 2 thing that can\u2019t separated. Yes, here the place\
  \ where you can fully find the both things. Surakarta, a place is well-known as\
  \ Solo city located in central Java, Indonesia. Born with Javanese blood in my body,\
  \ has been taught me to respect, polite towards anything. Steeped in Solo city,\
  \ I\u2019ve seen so many unique things such as, greetings from all people no matter\
  \ they recognize you or not, helping each other is a common thing, riding a vehicle\
  \ called \u201Cbecak\u201D who paddled by the old man just to give his passenger\
  \ to enjoying the city. \n\nThis city is not crowded that much, and based on the\
  \ data that I\u2019ve read on the internet, Surakarta (Solo) got the first place\
  \ for the most comfortable city to live in! I couldn\u2019t agree more with that,\
  \ because I saw that vehicle is not much as capital city, food is cheap, still has\
  \ rice fields and great places to visit!\n\nLet me tell you about Surakarta Palace.\
  \ There are 3 palace (we called Keraton) in Solo, which are Surakarta Hadiningrat\
  \ Palace, Mangkunegaran Palace and Pajang Palace. Sadly, I haven\u2019t visited\
  \ the last one yet. \n\nSurakarta Hadiningrat Palace (Keraton Surakarta Hadiningrat),\
  \ was built in 1743-1746. First time entering this place, the ambience was so different\
  \ and suddenly bringing me back to the old days. The building is so sturdy and full\
  \ of relics, and also there\u2019s a carriages that you can\u2019t missed it. We\
  \ can also see the history of Surakarta Hadiningrat Palace. When I stepping into\
  \ the yard of the palace, the visitor must to take off their shoes, I don\u2019\
  t know why until I saw that the yard is layered with sand. Looking around the yard,\
  \ full of tree and I can feel it the atmosphere was so different and I can\u2019\
  t stand it for long. After that I decided to go out from that place. I didn\u2019\
  t know why, but I felt something bizarre around myself  inside the palace. Don\u2019\
  t worry I still grateful for that. \n\nIndonesia still doing and believe cultural\
  \ traditional rituals, depends on what occasion, it caused by our ancient history.\
  \ Especially in central Java. People who born as blue blood in Surakarta Palace\
  \ is obligatory to follow all rules and rituals that has been arranged since a while\
  \ ago. It is for respect to the nature and ancestor. For example, when I came to\
  \ event of \u201CMalam Satu Suro\u201D (1 Suro Night) last September 2018. This\
  \ is an annually event in Solo. At first, I thought this event is related somwahat\
  \ about mystic, ghost or something like what other people said. I don\u2019t want\
  \ to make my own assumption and give a wrong information, so I googled it. \n\t\n\
  \tBased on the information that I\u2019ve read on google, \u201CMalam Satu Suro\u201D\
  \ is the first day of the Javanese calendar year in the month  of Sura (Suro), corresponding\
  \ with the Islamic month of Muharram. There are several rituals on this event, and\
  \ I remembered how crowded this city during this event. People are so excited, and\
  \ curious about what\u2019s happened next, especially for the tourists. This event\
  \ is started in the midnight-finish. \n\t\n\tI couldn\u2019t write all of those\
  \ several ritual here, but as I know that what people are waiting for is to see\
  \ the \u201CKebo Bule\u201D, an albino buffalo that believed to possess supernatural\
  \ abilities. Usually,  that white buffalo is paraded around the streets of Surakarta,\
  \ and people are following that. I also read that, \u201CKebo Bule\u201D is marked\
  \ of blessing and good health are given upon the Javanese.\n\t\n\tI remembered that\
  \ I couldn\u2019t stand that event until finished, because I\u2019m too tired and\
  \ it\u2019s getting crowded. After come back from that event, I realized how Javanese\
  \ especially in Surakarta still excited, fully respect to culture and all traditions.\
  \ \n\tAs I seen to metropolis, people aren\u2019t friendly and selfish to each other\
  \ moreover to the culture. I\u2019m blessed as a Javanese in my blood, by that I\
  \ have to be respect to anything, anyone and have to perpetuate the culture."
