Text: "I didn't really expect to find myself sitting in a car in rural Germany, crying\
  \ my eyes out as I left the driveway of two people I'd never met before. I had won\
  \ a trip to Berlin to play in a poker tournament, and so the trip I'd had in mind\
  \ was quite different. A few months ago, I thought I'd said a permanent goodbye\
  \ to my (ex) girlfriend when she moved back to Germany from New Zealand. It's a\
  \ bit surreal that clicking buttons online can take you to the opposite side of\
  \ the world, making what seems impossibly far away a reality.\n\nThere's something\
  \ so powerful about the temporary nature of travel. Memories coalesce and solidify\
  \ in real time, becoming so much more vivid than everyday experiences. I can still\
  \ revisit the cobblestone streets of Blomberg - a small town in the Lippe region\
  \ of Germany - just by closing my eyes, and yet I can barely remember what I did\
  \ last week. The distinctive white and brown half-timbered houses lining the road\
  \ were like taking a step back in time. Some of them proudly displayed their construction\
  \ date: \"1779\". There's not a single building in existence in New Zealand from\
  \ before 1822.\n\nComing from the cold, impersonality of a city hotel room, it was\
  \ incredibly warming to be welcomed into a traditional German countryside home by\
  \ my girlfriend's parents. Her father didn't speak a word of English, and my German\
  \ was also terrible. And yet somehow through gestures we could communicate really\
  \ well. It's almost as if words sometimes get in the way of what we're really trying\
  \ to say. \n\nAnd then sometimes, they're not enough for what we want to say. In\
  \ the blink of an eye, a week was gone. Not without memories of the echoes of our\
  \ footsteps in an empty church, a deep sleep in a room shuttered into total darkness,\
  \ the acrophobic ascent of the Externsteine rocks, or a secret kiss in the forest\
  \ to avoid any small town gossip. These moments of connection are what make travel\
  \ worthwhile. Not cheesy tourist photos in front of Brandenburger Tor (which is\
  \ way smaller in real life anyway). \n\nTravel writing is never easy because the\
  \ greatest moments are the ones where words fail us. How do you say goodbye to two\
  \ people who have welcomed you into their home for a week and treated you like family?\
  \ What words are enough when travel takes you away from someone you love?\n\nThe\
  \ wave hit me as soon as the car ignition started, the deep sorrow of a permanent\
  \ goodbye. Followed quickly by the realisation that I had learned nothing. Once\
  \ again my mind had fooled me into thinking that just because this world is so vast,\
  \ that we are separated from where we want to go and the people we care about. I\
  \ arrived at the train station having left my accompanying sadness behind, knowing\
  \ that there's only ever goodbye for now."
