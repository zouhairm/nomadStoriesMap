Text: "I have been a fan of the South Korea country for a long time. because I was\
  \ unable to pay for everything to travel to South Korea, I finally decided to only\
  \ admire South Korea through the internet. but one day, someone I knew asked me\
  \ to take a singing audition to be held in South Korea. and finally I auditioned\
  \ and managed to become a participant. I am very grateful and very happy. I no longer\
  \ dreamed of a visa to go to South Korea. even more cool, I can go there not only\
  \ to enjoy the state of South Korea that is very beautiful, but I can go there to\
  \ live my hobby and passion, which is singing. besides being introduced by some\
  \ entertainment media there, I can also enjoy the beauty of the beautiful City of\
  \ Paju because I lived in the city while I was in South Korea. because I left for\
  \ South Korea during the spring, I was very lucky to be able to see Sakura flowers\
  \ that I had never seen before. Paju city is very beautiful if we come in spring.\
  \ \n\nbesides being a beautiful Country, in South Korea it is also famous for traditional\
  \ foods that are loved by many people from another Country. I still clearly remember\
  \ how it feels there is street food. lots of tourist queuing to buy these foods.\
  \ for example, street food; rice cakes, odeng or omuk, kimbab (rice rolls), Jjajang\
  \ Noodle and many more. not forgetting also because of the cold weather, I always\
  \ take care of my health by consuming ginseng drinks from South Korea.\n\none very\
  \ important thing that I always guard is respecting the traditions of other countries\
  \ and maintaining our attitude when visiting other countries. the staff reminded\
  \ me a lot not to smoke indiscriminately because their country forbade cigarette\
  \ smoke in public places, if we violated then we would be imprisoned. therefore\
  \ I respect other countries like other countries respecting my country too.\n\n\
  I didn't expect this to happen. but God is really good. I'm so grateful."
