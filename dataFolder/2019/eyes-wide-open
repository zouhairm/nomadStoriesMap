Text: "Travel , when I say this word , I feel a sudden adrenaline rush in my body.\n\
  It\u2019s just not about a place , it\u2019s just not about people , it\u2019s about\
  \ you , how different spaces and different energies around you can bring in about\
  \ a new difference and a few new evaluations inside of you , making you discover\
  \ and re kindle yourself over and over again , every single time. \nI don\u2019\
  t think anything I pursue or work for in my daily life , would be happening if it\
  \ was not for experiencing these new cultures and places . \nIt is the reason for\
  \ me to get up and be even more motivated than the last day and it will be the same\
  \ till am strong on my feet every single day, \nUntil today places that I\u2019\
  ve travelled have just been about 1% of the world. I want to see the other 99% ,\
  \ I want to see how other cultures look like , how other people react to a certain\
  \ thing , how funny can it be if I go to an alien territory without knowing about\
  \ it and by the time I leave that territory I call it all mine . \nSounds amazing\
  \ , isn\u2019t it ? \nBut tell me something , after you have lived a place for a\
  \ few days c does it get difficult to leave the memories and the space behind to\
  \ switch on to a new journey ? \nYes , right ? \nBut at the same time , longer we\
  \ stay at 1 place , it gets monotonous.\nMaybe instead of we , I should be saying\
  \ me , because am not too sure if everyone feels how I feel about travelling , about\
  \ how important is it for me , for my existence , for just motivating myselves every\
  \ single day , it\u2019s just an awareness that I got a few years back to just be\
  \ up and see the world around, write about every place you see , how it changed\
  \ you , and trust me , travelling can bring just about positive changes in you ,\
  \ every place will just a leave a smile on your face to bid a goodbye to you and\
  \ to say \u201Csee me again soon\u201D."
