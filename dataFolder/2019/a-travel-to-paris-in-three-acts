Text: "Act I - The arrival \n\nLift for technicians\n\nI read the sign \"Sous-sol\
  \ \u2013 Entresol\u201D. \nI have fun. Make no sense. I speak Portuguese and \"\
  sol\" means sun. My thoughts were mixed with unrecognizable music and a dog's sounds,\
  \ far away, background music.\n\"Sol\" don't exist in the underground or between\
  \ the levels.\nBut, be careful, exist the opposite.\nPlease, someone, tell to the\
  \ french lift attendant.  \n\nAct III - The stay\n\nFrench bath\n\nSome days, after\
  \ the camembert diet, accompanied by bread and wines, I feel fat, sweaty, my femininity\
  \ feels the guilt and the dismantlement of a foot without nail varnish. One of those\
  \ days, I finish naked in the bathtub between bath salts and see my menses flowing\
  \ for my legs. I like the idea and turn the glass of wine to complete the color.\
  \ It's a friendly shadow trying to get a shape inside the warm water. I sink, lazy.\
  \ I smell. There is no smell. The foot complains about the absence of water. He's\
  \ a fish now. I'm a cloud, full of knowledge. Suddenly I remember something to do.\
  \ I open the tub and realize that I run into the drain, along with the water.\n\n\
  Pute que Paris\n\nI meet her with three smiles on the face because your eyes shine\
  \ a lot. Rosemarie, it's a Mary in rose, a flower bud. Pure lady, independent, elegant\
  \ at the dinner table on Bon restaurant. Smile ear to ear, and both full of jewels.\
  \ Looks like a sweet grandma, but thirty diamonds more elegant. Smile honest, your\
  \ hands open, offers what she have. \"Ces't va?\" \"Bien!\" She tells me about your\
  \ three pute friends. \"Interesting ladies! Full of stories!\" and she tells me\
  \ about the day she found the three putes on the street and invite the girls to\
  \ a tea in the Ritz in front of the stunned employes! \nAt the dinner table, everybody\
  \ was surprised. She is a friend of Madame Claude, the most powerful and rich cabaret\
  \ onwer in Paris.\nI drink my wine. I celebrate in a silence full of respect for\
  \ that amazing aunty who I don't see a long time, since my last incarnation. \n\n\
  Act III - The return\n\nMy great-great-grandfather would never have imagined that\n\
  \nIt's nice travel cutting the night. Encapsulated, the hands flat in the tiny window,\
  \ the night is all swarovski outside there."
