Text: "I woke up in the hostel to the view of Table Mountain -  what a day to be alive.\
  \  \n\nAge 25 is what many considered to be the-quarter-life crisis. Most of us\
  \ feel like we are lost, confused and we start questioning if we know the purpose\
  \ of living or if we are on the right track. Travelling South Africa solo was the\
  \ best thing I could do for myself at 25. This country is commonly believed to be\
  \ unsafe especially for female solo travellers.  Upon leaving for my trip, the question\
  \ I got asked the most was \"why are you travelling alone in South Africa\" and\
  \ of course my parents worried for my safety. \n\nI started in Johannesburg , visiting\
  \ township Soweto was the highlight. It is crazy how tribes were killing each other\
  \ 25 years ago, and 25 years later, here I stand, walking through township experiencing\
  \ poverty and also community.  Soweto was the only township many could access, and\
  \ there are many other poor townships like this in South Africa. One of the questions\
  \ that crossed my mind was the cold winter nights families had to go through, as\
  \ I find it difficult sleeping through cold nights in Australia.\n\nJeffrey Bay\
  \ has the most beautiful sunrise. During my impromptu surf trip, I learnt that sharks\
  \ do not like human. They eat human sometimes merely by accident where they mistaken\
  \ us for seals, and so they'd have spat human flesh after a few bites - \"eww not\
  \ seal\" . This then changed my itinerary on shark cage diving because this activity\
  \ actually disrupts the food chain in the ecology area. I learnt the beauty of sharks\
  \ from avid surfers and they deserve a lot more love than what we perceive.\n\n\
  8am - I hiked through beautiful forest of Tsitsikamma national park. Being lost\
  \ in the national park with no one around was very liberating, I felt like mother\
  \ nature was taking care of me like a 5 year old curious child. The national park\
  \ is next to the sea with huge waves - it has a name 'Storm River'. I get it , when\
  \ the wave hits the shore, it roars, hence the name - it reminded me of Mickey's\
  \ Fantasia Sorcerer's Apprentice. Anyway, after exploring the national park - both\
  \ secluded area and tourist attractions, I joined the retirees who came in their\
  \ caravans , sat by the shore, appreciating the beauty of waves. Waves - so beautiful\
  \ yet dangerous, came storming at us as we got lost in time.\n\nVan journeys are\
  \ where you meet friends. Along the way, I met new friends who would try and include\
  \ me in conversations. We would then arrange to stay in the same hostel and visit\
  \ places. When you are out travelling, you tend to see the beauty of basic interaction.\
  \ No phone, just the first hello which leads to friendship and many laughters. It\
  \ is so beautiful, no judgement, you can be who you want. This is what human need\
  \ - real interaction and not a life portrayed through social media. I felt very\
  \ light-hearted throughout my travels - in real life, perhaps social media is doing\
  \ more harm than good ; skin colour & accents matter way too much ; social and family\
  \ status fits people in boxes ; sexuality and gender identity make people feel out\
  \ of place. \n\nSouth Africa - you made me realise that life is worth living. We\
  \ go through so many insecurities that our problems seem so insignificant when your\
  \ beauty, both nature and culture absolutely defy all the doubts I had.\n\nTable\
  \ Mountain is also a real beauty and you should visit Cape Town to understand why\
  \ it got its name."
