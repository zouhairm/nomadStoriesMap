Text: ",A picture is worth a thousand words', goes that age-old saying, and it usually\
  \ applies to most situations.\n\nHowever, to each rule, there is an exception.\n\
  \nI found out that the Vatican was one of these exceptions.\n\nNo thousand pictures\
  \ can prepare a person for the confrontation with the architectural awe that is\
  \ the Peter's Square and Saint Peter's Basilica. As a student of history, I knew\
  \ what I was getting myself into when I visited the Eternal City with its Italian\
  \ flair, its numerous streets that each tend to hide a little treasure, be it a\
  \ lovely restaurant serving the very best homemade pasta, a historical building\
  \ holding century-old secrets, or a charming little shop. Those sound like clich\xE9\
  s, but it's ridiculous how much they apply for Rome. \n\nHowever, when I made the\
  \ first step into the St. Peter's Basilica, after already having been mesmerized\
  \ by the sheer grandeur of the Peter's Square, with its dozens of collonades circling\
  \ the place, the multitude of statues crowning said colums and, standing next to\
  \ the obelisk, one of the most imposing Christmas trees I have had the chance to\
  \ see - the street lights become unnecessary when its Christmas lights are on -,\
  \ I was literally struck to the ground. It's no exaggeration when I say that I couldn't\
  \ see the end of the Basilica. It stretches on and on into the four directions,\
  \ filled with symbolism and precision in every painting and every sculpture. The\
  \ ceilings are a caleidoscope of colour and biblical references, and one doesn't\
  \ need to know each of the referenced stories to be impressed with that tapestry\
  \ of paintings. \n\nOf course, my inner historian was leaping into the seventh heaven.\n\
  \nEven with the hundreds of tourists in the Basilica, myself included, there was\
  \ a sort of respectful hush, a reverence in the air. \n\nThe key term of the movement\
  \ of Romanticism was ,The Sublime': it describes the feeling of simultanous awe\
  \ and terror when confronted with a certain landscape of scenery. My typical example\
  \ for it is the darkest night sky filled with thousands of stars and reminding myelf\
  \ that each star is actually a sun just like that big fireball we see every day\
  \ in the sky. \n\nSeeing and experiencing the Vatican was the Sublime of architecture."
