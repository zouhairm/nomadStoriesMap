Text: "Montana feels like home. It\u2019s something weird for a Brazilian to say,\
  \ we don\u2019t have harsh winters, glaciers and bears. How could I feel home in\
  \ a place so different? I don\u2019t know, but I feel a deep bliss under Montana\u2019\
  s big sky.\nThis love started last year. I was crossing the US on a two-month solo\
  \ road trip. It seemed a perfect adventure\u2014you leave DC\u2019s hot summer,\
  \ drive through different landscapes listening to historic fiction audiobooks, sleep\
  \ and hike in pine-smelling forests, eat by a campfire, count bears and hawks. Although\
  \ the above is true, crossing the United States while camping alone is not full\
  \ time joy.\nThe first two nights I couldn\u2019t sleep because I was in self-defense\
  \ mode, afraid someone had seen I was a woman camping alone and intended harm. Yet,\
  \ every morning I was fine, surrounded by families starting breakfast. After driving\
  \ the third day on little sleep, I was questioning the road trip. So I got a hotel\
  \ room for 70 dollars in Fargo, ND, where I felt like a queen so well I slept. Next\
  \ was Theodore Roosevelt National Park, where I spent two days photographing wild\
  \ horses and bison, reading Teddy\u2019s quotes, and hiking through petrified wood\
  \ forests. But my nights were still not restful enough. Then there was Montana,\
  \ where I finally mastered road-tripping. \nIt was an August afternoon when I arrived\
  \ at Lewis and Clark National Forest. Entering it from the North was spectacular,\
  \ stonewalls and a calm river surround the unpaved road. I went slowly and in awe.\
  \ The place was more pristine and less crowded than a National Park. The few people\
  \ around were happy and enjoying. A couple was getting married by the river, up\
  \ the road teenagers on ATVs suddenly appeared from the forest, and the people camping\
  \ were chatting and laughing. I remember thinking how rare was that. Often people\
  \ around me, including myself, are always on a mission to accomplish something and\
  \ forget to just be. In that forest, just being was unanimous. So right there, without\
  \ infrastructure or cell service, I finally slept well while camping. Sounds contradictory,\
  \ but the freedom I felt was overwhelming, right in the most remote and least likely\
  \ place to feel safe so far. To complete my euphoria, a bear came by while I was\
  \ waiting for sunrise the next morning. Just like that, I fell in love with Montana.\
  \ \nI could write a book about how the next days were special. About how the rivers\
  \ in Montana sound. I could talk about the campground host who gifted me bear spray\
  \ so enthusiastically I must have sounded about \u201Cbear watching.\u201D Glacier\
  \ National Park and the Going-to-the-Sun Road would take me pages to describe. I\
  \ could write, for example, about how I drove to Vancouver, Canada, and then changed\
  \ my entire return route to the East Coast so I could spend more time in Montana;\
  \ and how two extra nights became four, and then became eight, until I couldn\u2019\
  t prolong my stay anymore. There was a day I drove slowly to go alongside a moose.\
  \ And a morning I took my favorite picture of all times\u2014one of a large bear\
  \ on the thin branches of a huckleberry bush indulging before winter. I know where\
  \ I would build the cutest little cabin, and also know where the 5-foot sandhill\
  \ cranes land when they migrate south. I will save all those stories for another\
  \ day. This one is about my love for Montana.\nEverything I love is for a reason;\
  \ it has to do with how that makes me evolve. Animals make me feel humble. My camera\
  \ and my car empower me to experience what I love. Montana was where I learned that\
  \ I shouldn\u2019t drive uphill on an icy soil road unless the car is in four-wheel\
  \ drive (or that I shouldn\u2019t drive on them, period, I am Brazilian and roads\
  \ should never be icy). Above all\u2014Montana is where I learned that if you are\
  \ true to yourself and if you trust that intuitive instinct inside you everything\
  \ will be pretty good, for that is when you connect with yourself, and that is home."
