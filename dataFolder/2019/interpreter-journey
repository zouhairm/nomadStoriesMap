Text: "First time, I went to Japan in 2009 by a scholarship from The Japan Foundation\
  \ through Padjadjaran University, where I studied Bachelor degree in Japanese Literature\
  \ majority. Then, I got a summer course program just for 6 weeks, before I have\
  \ my graduation celebration. Lucky me, by this scholarship I could know about Japan\
  \ culture further directly and could go to several big cities, such as Osaka, Tokyo,\
  \ Nara, Kyoto, and Aomori. \n\nSince I get an experience as above, it took me to\
  \ find out any opportunities to work in Japan. \n\nI was graduated in January, 2010.\
  \ Then, for the first work experience, it was not related to Japan, I just worked\
  \ as Secretary for 1 year and 10 months. However, the opportunities to work in foreign\
  \ country were quite difficult and hard challenges. \n\nBut, my heart still want\
  \ to found out any chances. Then, I got a job from translation company in the end\
  \ of 2011. Unfortunately, there were just being as an interpreting for Japanese\
  \ expatriates and doing translation documents for foreign capital companies in industrial\
  \ area in Indonesia. I had just 10 months in that company. \n\nI searching any informations\
  \ again and again, then I got a job from Japan company in Shiga in the end of 2012\
  \ Prefecture as an interpreter for technical internal trainee that sent from Indonesia\
  \ to Japan, to learn directly about Japan technology on that company. I had this\
  \ duty for 6 months, then sent to branch office in Indonesia. I became an Assistant\
  \ Manager of Human Resources Development. However, my heart still want to work in\
  \ Japan. So, after 10 months worked at the branch office, I resigned. \n\nLuckily,\
  \ I got an information from my university friend, that Japan company in Hiroshima\
  \ Prefecture need an interpreter and mentor for a hundred trainees from Indonesia\
  \ and other Asian Countries. I worked for only 1 year contract, but I got experiences\
  \ to go to related company in Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Nepal. And, had lokal business\
  \ trip went to many areas in Hiroshima Prefecture, and Kyushu. I finished the Job\
  \ on July, 2015. \n\nUnexpectedly, on that month my friend in Osaka told me that\
  \ Japan company in Osaka in the same field need an Interpreter. So, I got a fast\
  \ interview then moved to Osaka by August, 2015. In this company, I had a long experience\
  \ until I resigned on April, 2018. Interpreter duty brings me from Osaka Area to\
  \ Hokkaido Area. \n\nFrom my experiences as above, I learned about that interpreter\
  \ journey could be as a world journey. It shows us about the important of  foreign\
  \ language ability to bring us to see worldwide and know many cultures of other\
  \ countries. \n\n17 February 2019 \nBy Pipit Yulianti Dipura, B.A."
