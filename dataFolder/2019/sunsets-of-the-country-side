Text: "As most trips start mine was a disaster. There I was arriving in a land unknown\
  \ but curious for the adventure. My sister and I hopped off the plane in London\
  \ 22:15 when our train left at 22:50. Racing through the airport, too afraid to\
  \ ask questions we find our train and took a deep breath in.\n\nI found myself jet\
  \ lagged but refused to sleep. It was a 4 hour ride and I was prepared to stay awake\
  \ through it all. The trains here weren\u2019t the same as the ones in Los Angeles.\
  \ Everything seemed to be moving at the speed of light. Buildings. Houses. Cars.\
  \ Trains. Everything a blur. It was magical. Once we were out of the city it all\
  \ turned green and my heart was filled with joy. So much green. \u2018Oh look sheep!\u2019\
  \ I screamed in my head. I\u2019ve seen a sheep before but I thought to myself this\
  \ is a European sheep, it\u2019s better. \n\nAfter about an hour of sitting and\
  \ staring out the window I fell asleep and I woke up as we reached our destination,\
  \ the city of Chester. We got off the train carrying more luggage then most. I assumed\
  \ we looked like foreigners. My sister located her boyfriend who would drive us\
  \ to our house in Wales. More sitting. I wasn\u2019t too happy. I was exhausted.\
  \ Sitting on a plane for 11 hours, sitting on a train for 4 hours, and now to sit\
  \ again for 45 mins in a car. It was torture. And as fate would have it, I was starving.\
  \ \n\nIt was 6pm on a Sunday. If you\u2019ve never been to the U.K, Sundays are\
  \ family days. Which meant I would be starving for some time because most businesses\
  \ closed early. We stopped by a Mc Donalds. Or as my sisters boyfriend Ryan called\
  \ it, Maccies. Tasted different to be fair. But I didn't complain because it was\
  \ food. Food is love. I just wanted to get home to shower. I was ready for bed.\
  \ \n\nWe arrived at the cottage around 7:30 and when we pulled up my mouth dropped.\
  \ Now I\u2019m from Los Angeles, we have beautiful houses everywhere. I\u2019ve\
  \ always been jealous of the houses on the Hollywood Hills. The city lights and\
  \ all the people around. Being away from any of that wasn\u2019t something I could\
  \ ever think of. I was city girl. Though as we drove along the long endless lanes,\
  \ going 60 mph, and not having a car sight I felt comfort. So when I saw the house\
  \ I would call home for the next three weeks everything changed. It was a cute two\
  \ story house with a gorgeous dinning room. Windows surrounding it. Beautiful porch.\
  \ A great size kitchen. It was breathtaking. \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it was\
  \ where I would be staying. I ran up the stairs to see the room I chose. I walked\
  \ in and jumped right on the bed. Laughed and giggled as I stripped away my shoes\
  \ and socks. Laying there for a few seconds I decided to pull the curtains aside\
  \ and there it was, the first sunset of our vacation. Pink and orange sky. Huge\
  \ fluffy clouds. I wanted to cry. This all felt like a dream. It couldn\u2019t be\
  \ real. I stared at that sunset for so long then closed my eyes and smiled. I listened\
  \ for all the sounds I could hear. My sister and her boyfriend laughing. Crickets.\
  \ Sheep. But what I heard most was my heart beating and it was the best feeling\
  \ ever. \n\nI learned that day not only are the sunsets the best in the U.K but\
  \ that this is where I belonged. This was home. No city lights. Thousands of people.\
  \ No blurs. This was who I was. Just me, my sheep, and skies of hope and dreams.\
  \ \n\nLet the journey begin I wisphered into the air, I was ready."
