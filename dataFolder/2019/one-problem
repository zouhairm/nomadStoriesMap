Text: "One finger trails through steely water, the small ripples of its wake seemingly\
  \ the only disturbance for miles. Even in August, the stinging cold proves too much\
  \ after a few seconds. I still have half a mind to dunk my entire swollen, sun-scorched\
  \ hand under for a moment of relief, but think better of it. The gentle trickle\
  \ of the kayak paddle is the only sound as I lazily sweep it through layers of crystalline\
  \ blue. On the periphery, the mountains are as silent as they are commanding, jagged\
  \ peaks of ice and rock; an effortless reminder of the scale of things up here.\
  \ Occasionally the clean air is pierced by the roar of glacial ice calving, scraping\
  \ off into the water below: one lonely cry for help from the top of the world.\n\
  -----------------\n\tMy last morning in Alaska was spent picking up trash from the\
  \ beach of Montague Island in Prince William Sound, an inlet about an hour and a\
  \ half\u2019s drive from Anchorage on the state\u2019s south-central coastline.\
  \ After six days living out of kayaks and camping on gravelly shores, our seven-man\
  \ group was heading home from the college Outdoors Club trip of a lifetime. As we\
  \ loaded up our kayaks, I stuffed a makeshift garbage bag full of granola bar wrappers\
  \ and cigarette butts inside, an unexpected addition to the bear spray and tent\
  \ poles so carefully arranged. \n\tOur first day on the water we were driven by\
  \ boat from the town of Whittier, population 208, and dropped off on one of the\
  \ islands that scatter the sound. Our plan was to kayak out farther and then take\
  \ our time paddling back to Whittier, stopping over on different dots of land each\
  \ night. In the first three days, I saw no human beings aside from the six friends\
  \ I came with, and paddling out to the front of our group it was easy to imagine\
  \ this place as something completely untouched: Low hanging fog punctured by weathered\
  \ crags of island, everything calm aside from the occasional ripple of a seal popping\
  \ above water with quiet curiosity. They probably hadn\u2019t seen enough of us\
  \ to be afraid. \n\tWe paddled all day and then took our time setting up camp in\
  \ the 9pm sunlight. I never felt fully dry, because even off the water the rain\
  \ was unrelenting. When it wasn\u2019t flat-out pouring, there was a ubiquitous\
  \ mist that clung to everything. It hugged the surrounding mountains so densely\
  \ that often we couldn\u2019t see them at all, only sense their enormity. On the\
  \ fourth night we camped out on an island nicknamed \u201CThe Driveway\u201D for\
  \ its sloping entry point that immediately comes into view from the water. We cooked\
  \ dinner under a tarp, listening to the rain beat an angry barrage against our synthetic\
  \ cover. After dinner we laughed and gagged on \u201Cpot shots\u201D of water mixed\
  \ with the cold food residue in our bowls to clean them. We packed up the rest of\
  \ our food in bear barrels and scrupulously checked to make sure we\u2019d left\
  \ no evidence behind. Above us the tarp\u2019s garish red stood out like a wound\
  \ on the landscape, otherwise ice-blue and unmarred.\n\tThat night in our tent,\
  \ my friends and I listened to the rain slow to a drip in the soft twilight of 11:30.\
  \ I lay on my side in my sleeping bag, jacket rolled up into a fleecy pillow, while\
  \ we talked ourselves to sleep. I learned more about them during our nights in the\
  \ tent than in all the time we\u2019d spent together at college. As we whispered\
  \ about our fears for life after graduation, it occurred to me that my phone had\
  \ been turned off for at least four days. I didn\u2019t miss it. I had also never\
  \ voiced those fears aloud before, but cocooned in the blue light on an island that\
  \ looked like it had never known anyone before us, almost nothing felt too scary\
  \ to say out loud. What problem could be more formidable than the landscape, after\
  \ all?"
