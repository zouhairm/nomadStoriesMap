Text: "Indonesia is a country which has the most volcanoes in the world with around\
  \ 130 of them are still active. Despite the horrifying stories about volcano eruptions,\
  \ they sure offer really great scenery from the top. Mount Bromo is one of hundreds\
  \ active volcanoes in Indonesia and it is located in East Java. This mountain is\
  \ famous for its mesmerizing view during the sunrise and that is one of the reasons\
  \ why tourists come here every day.\n   There are many ways to get to Mount Bromo.\
  \ For domestic tourists, they usually come from Malang and they will have to take\
  \ around two hours of driving from the city to get to the mountain. My friends and\
  \ I got the chance to visit this mountain in 2015. We started our trip by visiting\
  \ some museums and theme park around Malang and the city of Batu, which is famous\
  \ for its mountainous area and a perfect place to spend the holiday with your family.\
  \ This city is also known for its mild climate, which is good for me since it is\
  \ really different with the climate in the city where I live.\n   We finally started\
  \ our trip to the mountain later that night. We took off from the hotel we stayed\
  \ at midnight, since it will take two hours of driving and we did not want to miss\
  \ our chance to see the sunrise. After one hour on the road, we were finally out\
  \ of the city and now the road was so bumpy. One of my friends felt sick because\
  \ of the motion so we took a break for her to take some medicines. \n   Because\
  \ of the delay, it took a little bit longer for us to get there. After 2.5 hours,\
  \ we finally arrived at the entrance gate of Mount Bromo. When we got there, there\
  \ were already a lot of people who also wanted to get up to the mountain. To get\
  \ to the sunrise view point, we have to rent a jeep car since city cars will not\
  \ be able to go to the top due to the extreme track. A few days before our trip,\
  \ we already booked one so we were not worried about not getting any car. Unfortunately,\
  \ when we called the car driver, he said that we could not get any car because they\
  \ were all out for rent. It will be impossible to get another car since it was really\
  \ crowded on that day due to Easter holiday.\n   We were so confused because we\
  \ already got there and it was impossible to get back there on the next day. We\
  \ had no other options rather than rented an ojek. Ojek is the Indonesian taxi motorcycle.\
  \ After did a bargaining with the drivers, we finally rented three ojek since there\
  \ were three of us. It was 4 am when we started to go up and we were almost late\
  \ for the sunrise. It was really cold that night since we had to take motorcycle\
  \ and trip to the top took around 30 minutes. However, there is always a good thing\
  \ behind everything. The good thing about taking a motorcycle was that we could\
  \ see stars very clearly as it is almost impossible to see the stars if we took\
  \ the car.\n   After half hour on the motorcycle, we finally got to the sunrise\
  \ view point. When we got there, there were already a lot of people waiting for\
  \ the sunrise. We tried to find a spot and waited for another 30 minutes until the\
  \ sun rises and it was the most beautiful sunrise I have ever seen. After seeing\
  \ the sunrise, our drivers took us to the sea of sand and the volcano where we can\
  \ take photos and tried horse riding.\n   After all, the trip to Mount Bromo was\
  \ really unforgettable. I did not expect that it will be hard to get to the top,\
  \ but once I got there and saw how beautiful the scenery from our view point was,\
  \ we suddenly forgot all the difficulties we faced to get there. It was really worth\
  \ the effort."
