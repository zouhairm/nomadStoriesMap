Text: "The date with the schengen visa aplication center was at 8.55am in London.\
  \ This is what happen.\n6am o clock i woke up, get dressed, brush a little de hair\
  \ and with all the documents in one hand and in the other one bread with jam, i\
  \ started runing, tryinig to get the 6.25am train in Seaford's train station.\n\
  All the stars shining up in the sky... making the nigth more cold for someone who\
  \ has to walk 15 minutes more on the pavement, but no problem... the moon , the\
  \ birds singing, the wind and his own mysterious sound... in the middle of the hurry,\
  \ that tiny moment of perfect harmony peace and beauty, made me think \"everything\
  \ is gonna be fine\" .\n6.20am I'm in the train.\n6.25am I'm looking for some WIFI\
  \ connection, to show my e-ticket.\n6.30am I'm rechecking all the documents for\
  \ the place.\n7.45am I'm in Lewes, making a scale.\n8.15am I arrived to Victoria\
  \ Station but i don't have more money for the underground... don't worry , let's\
  \ try to find a way in..\nWaiting for someone who has to use the disability door,\
  \ because of the time that special gates take to close...\nThis is the moment, the\
  \ guard is talking in the radio, the camera red button is off and one old man is\
  \ just crossing the gate... carry on Domenica!!!.. \n8.25am I did the same as to\
  \ enter.. I'm outside the stop that Google maps indicated, asking the people nearby,\
  \ how did I get to the Spanish consulate?\n8.35am I'm just outside the door of the\
  \ building, but it says here \"open time 8.45am\".\nPerfect! My time is great!\n\
  I decided to made a stroll in the surroundings and maybe drink something hot.\n\
  London is unique, the streets are clean, the sky is blue and the sun is not that\
  \ strong... the people is hurry to get to them jobs, the cars are in sintony with\
  \ the traffic light... a wonderful morning here in England... \nNo no... wake up!!\
  \ What time it is?\n8.45am I'm inside the bulding.\n- good morning,  im here because\
  \ i want to make a schengen visa aplication\n- what is your nationality?\n- Ecuadorian.\n\
  - this is not the place, you must go to BLS international...\nThe smile in my face\
  \ disappear, my eyes started to blur and my throat cleared..\n-pardon?\n-this is\
  \ the direction\nThe woman who was attending my showed me a paper with an address\
  \ and a phone number...\n-no, but my date was at 8.55am, how far it is?\n-i don't\
  \ know, is 8.50am already, better hurry.\nI took the paper and get out of the building,\
  \ afraid of what just happen..\n-esquiusmi, do you know where it is?\nI asked again\
  \ and again.. but nobody could help me with that..\n-ask a police officer.. one\
  \ woman told me\nBut there was no officers, just one mail car with a man inside..\n\
  -hello sir, could you please tell me how far this direction is? Walking\nThe man\
  \ get surprised\n-walking?\n-i dont have money, so is the only way..\nHe searched\
  \ in him phone the address..\n-20 minutes in car.. at what time you need to be there?\n\
  -in 3 minutes..\n8.57am I'm in the mail car, calling to BLS international, for apologizing\
  \ myself because of the time and telling them what just happened.\n-you have a premium\
  \ reservation?\n-yes.. im so sorry\n-dont worry, you have 30m more.\nAnd all the\
  \ good energy get into my face again.. 30m ... but the trafic was terrible  don't\
  \ worry Domenica, you are on the way.\n-thank you sir for doing this.. what is your\
  \ name by the way?\n-Berln, yours?\n-Domenica\n-So why are applying?\nI'm a 18 years\
  \ old latin girl, in the car of a stranger... what could i say?\n-Because Spain\
  \ has more opportunities for working than here.\n-are you sure?\nBerln was from\
  \ south arabia\n-well yes, for ecuadorian people is better in Spain than in England..\n\
