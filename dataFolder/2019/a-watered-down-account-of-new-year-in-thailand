Text: "With my finger still hovering over the trigger of my weapon, I wipe the sweat\
  \ from my brow as the morning humidity presses down upon me. Across the road, I\
  \ catch sight of a market seller, scrambling to take cover. He meets my gaze and\
  \ I shoot him a tight, furtive nod. In return, he holds up three fingers. Three\
  \ hostiles? I scan the perimeter. Nothing. I gesture for more information. Now he\
  \ holds up two fingers. Again, I steal a glance down the road but I see no sign\
  \ of any threat he could be alluding to. And then, slowly, he shows me the reverse\
  \ of his hand, leaving just one finger extended. The middle finger. By the time\
  \ I have turned to face my three, grinning assailants, it is already too late and\
  \ I have been doused with an industrial-sized bucket of freezing cold water.\n\n\
  Every year in Thailand, thousands of people take to the streets to celebrate the\
  \ Songkran Festival as locals welcome in the Thai New Year with three straight days\
  \ of well-mannered watery warfare. Falling at the end of the country\u2019s dry\
  \ season, a national water fight festival certainly offers welcome respite during\
  \ a period in which temperatures can reach 45 degrees, but behind the mayhem lies\
  \ a very traditional Buddhist sentiment. \n\nFor centuries, the Thai people have\
  \ gathered during the Songkram to splash water over their friends and families,\
  \ believing that this practice will wash away their bad luck from the previous year\
  \ so that they may enter the new year in good fortune. I therefore took great comfort\
  \ in the knowledge that I was about to be cleansed of all misfortune as I stepped\
  \ out of my tuktuk upon arrival in Bangkok, only for my wallet to be promptly blasted\
  \ out of my hand by a six-year-old packing a supersoaker so big he had to fire it\
  \ from his shoulder like a bazooka. \n\nArmed only with a poxy water pistol, I spent\
  \ most of Songkran, Thailand' cowering in various hidey-holes, which allowed me\
  \ ample time for reflection. Western influence has certainly flexed its capitalist\
  \ muscles in Thailand, with American food chains now outmuscling traditional street\
  \ vendors at every corner and more 7-elevens springing up than you can shake a slurpee\
  \ at. One might even argue that the Songkran Festival itself has cashed in its own\
  \ cultural significance for an event which better appeals to the masses of tourists\
  \ that descend upon Thailand each year. And yet, as I watch an elderly gentleman\
  \ cackle in manic glee as he rains water balloons upon a family of unsuspecting\
  \ tourists, Thailand\u2019s enduring appeal becomes clear.\n\nSure, visitors flock\
  \ to Thailand to find themselves in the foothills of Chiang Mai, typically before\
  \ going on to lose themselves at the infamous Full Moon Party. But it is the people\
  \ of Thailand they remember and return for. A warm, fun-loving people who take pride\
  \ in allowing strangers to share in their ways. Water and all."
