Text: "Growing up, my dad narrated the story of a Japanese lady who stitched the torn\
  \ seat of the train she was traveling by. Exceptional people, I thought. As I grew\
  \ up, I read a lot more about Japan - the lightning-quick Shinkansen, the beautiful\
  \ Geishas, stunning cherry blossom and Japanese tenacity in the wake of natural\
  \ disasters. \n\nDrawing a ten-day plan we, my wife and I, hopped onto Nippon Airways\
  \ flight. Our plan was to spend five days in Tokyo, five in Kyoto and day trips\
  \ from our two base locations. \n\nAs we boarded our first metro, the melodious\
  \ chant of \"Shibuya, Shibuya\" echoed from the recorded announcement. Once inside,\
  \ I noticed that in spite of the metro being fairly crowded, there was pin drop\
  \ silence. For a minute it felt like inside a church. With people considering it\
  \ inappropriate to talk while in trains, especially on phone, it took me time to\
  \ realize the etiquettes in Japan were very similar in almost all public spaces.\
  \ On the escalators, people stood on one side to allow others to rush past. \n\n\
  Though what surprised us most was the sheer humility of the people, either bowing\
  \ down multiple times to say, arigato gozaimasu (thank you), when we offered seats\
  \ to an old couple or the ticket collector that came out of his office and walked\
  \ with us to the bus stop so that we didn\u2019t get lost or our calligraphy class\
  \ hosts who offered us homemade regional delicacies after learning about our love\
  \ for food. \n\nFor the Japanese, cherry blossom is the essence of life, an ephemeral\
  \ phenomenon, a reminder that life is short but absolutely beautiful! \n\nAs Katsumoto,\
  \ the character from the movie The Last Samurai puts it, \"The perfect blossom is\
  \ a rare thing. You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a\
  \ wasted life.\" \n\nAnd the Japanese celebrate it with aplomb! We could see entire\
  \ families pulling in with bags of food and drinks in various parks. With rugs placed\
  \ below the cherry trees, there was finally some noise and laughter! \n\nTears of\
  \ joy is an expression that I would now associate with cherry blossom. A walk along\
  \ the Kamo river with shutterbugs finding the perfect pre-wedding shot, a stroll\
  \ in Kyoto's obnoxiously beautiful botanical garden or peddling around the city\
  \ with no particular destination but just soaking in the cherry pink, red and white\
  \ that nestles along the red and green thatched roofs. \n\nDuring the blossom period,\
  \ everything from tea to snacks is flavored with cherry flowers, including Senbei.\
  \ Being from India, snacks made of rice are a staple for us but Senbei is in a different\
  \ league in terms of texture, taste, and variety. But what turned out to be a surprise\
  \ package was the Japanese patisseries. Japan can truly pass as the new France.\
  \ Be it chic boutiques or food cars, pastries in Japan are surprisingly mouth-watering\
  \ and delicious. \n\nFood presentation is an art form in Japan. Restaurants market\
  \ various meals in transparent boxes, including sushi rolled nicely with different\
  \ fish. This coerces you to pick up more than you could bargain for.\n\nWhile there\
  \ are limited things I did prefer from local food delicacies, there is no dearth\
  \ in gaming options. I have had my fair tryst with gaming. But walking across the\
  \ four-storied buildings dedicated to games in Akihabara, Tokyo, you know the Japanese\
  \ are in a different league. Zealous gaming centers aside, there are buildings dedicated\
  \ to animated character toys, electronics, and cameras that intend to test your\
  \ credit card limits. \n\nSpeaking about cards, many shops including some McDonalds\
  \ don't accept cards. For a technology-driven country, this was a real surprise.\
  \ \n\nTechnology is a big part of Japanese life, from robotic companions to robotic\
  \ deliveries in restaurants, the most astonishing was the smart toilets. With lights,\
  \ seat temperature, water, flush, music - everything controlled by a microcontroller,\
  \ it was more like a throne that Jon Snow would aspire for! \n\nWhile the Japanese\
  \ are still rooted in their traditions and values, they are more modern than the\
  \ west. It is this contrast that is both perplexing and interesting and makes me\
  \ want to visit this beautiful country again!"
