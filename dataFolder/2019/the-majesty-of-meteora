Text: "As I rested atop a bulbous rock, with an adopted dog in tow, the Monastery\
  \ of \xC1yios St\xE9fanos sat directly in front of me. The Plain of Thessaly just\
  \ a sea of green criss-crosses below. It was inspiration in its purest form. Meteora\
  \ is not where I expected the European portion of my itinerary to lead, but by divine\
  \ intervention or simply good fortune, it\u2019s where it did.\n\nDating back to\
  \ the 14th century, \u201Cthe monasteries in the air\u201D were and remain a setting\
  \ of deep peace, prayer and meditation. The monks who opted to erect the floating\
  \ structures did so precisely because of the risk. It was the impossibility of its\
  \ formulated existence which made it come to fruition. The belief that if they were\
  \ to be successful, there was a force higher which allowed them to be. A confirmation\
  \ of faith borne from the power of what blind faith can achieve. A miraculous cycle.\n\
  \nI am not a man of faith, yet I am also not one to claim a subscription to the\
  \ sciences excludes the realm of it. What I do possess is a hefty dose of spirituality,\
  \ of an openness to the unknown. Within the walls of the Holy Monastery of Varla\xE1\
  m and beneath the dome of its Katholikon, I understood. I am not certain if it were\
  \ the fragrance of incense, the echos of soft chanting, the elaborate wall-to-wall\
  \ artistry, the history or the setting, but I was shook. Shook by an emotion I can\
  \ hardly describe. It was enough to bring one to tears, and it almost did.\n\nInto\
  \ the open air, the emotions continued, though of the sort I had the ability to\
  \ compartmentalize. Senses of wonder and awe, as I gazed out onto the field of craggy\
  \ pillars and deep river plains. It was earthquakes, which gave birth to this monstrosity;\
  \ a term I assign with the utmost respect. Over centuries, the ground rumbled and\
  \ raised the floor to new heights. As time continued to turn, erosion went to work,\
  \ eating away at the weaker links until only the most formidable of material remained.\
  \ This is what we see today; nature\u2019s sculptures.\n\nI had the pleasure of\
  \ visiting three monasteries during my time in Meteora. While I considered visiting\
  \ a fourth, it was ultimately decided the external views of the Monastery of \xC1\
  yios St\xE9fanos would suffice. Off of the main road and along an elongated cliff\
  \ overhang is where I ventured. There was peace beyond the small boulders and leafy\
  \ shrubs. It was just me, the sky, the valley and the monastery. And Rex.\n\nYou\
  \ may recall an earlier mention made to an adopted dog (to be frank, I believe I\
  \ was the one who was adopted). Upon returning from the gates of St. Stephen\u2019\
  s to a seat on this soaring height of seclusion, I had witnessed a small dog somehow\
  \ appearing oblivious to the dangers of lying in the road just beyond a blind turn.\
  \ \u201CNot on my watch\u201D was the anthem, as I assumed the tone of scolding\
  \ owner, beckoning this pup to my side, ensuring his safety for at least the following\
  \ hour. I can\u2019t quite answer for where the name Rex originated, but he just\
  \ looked like one (though he never did answer to it).\n\nAs my belly grumbled and\
  \ the sun began to cascade further toward Mount Koziakas, I said goodbye to my brief\
  \ friendship with the four legs of golden fur. A quickened pace ensued, as I hastily\
  \ made my way back down the trail. It was at about the halfway mark, when a pause\
  \ took hold. With all 2,000 feet of Alsos Rock before me, a humbling colossus, I\
  \ was besieged with exhilaration. A pump of the fist took to the sky as confirmation\
  \ of why I stood here, of what this trip was about. It was for these moments. This\
  \ is why I left my home and my job and set forth like a nomad with nothing but a\
  \ backpack and streaks of curiosity in my possession. It was to witness the large\
  \ and feel the small. To come to places like Meteora and be awakened. I would encourage\
  \ anyone to do the same."
