Text: "When you make a decision that travel is a priority in your life, it will always\
  \ be an adventure!\n\nI\u2019ve travelled a lot overseas and yet it was my recent\
  \ trip to Sydney that after dinner at the Rocks I walked into a Charles Billich\
  \ Dali Exhibition opening that was my most recent amazing connection.  I inocently\
  \ walked in, joined in and drank champagne with everyone.\n\nI met with the producer\
  \ of his documentary, characthers such as an Andy Warhol impersonator, along with\
  \ Christa Billich and the man himself\u2026. Charles Billich. I even got a few photos\
  \ with Charles.  His Gallery is must to visit for any visitor to Sydney and recommend\
  \ doing some research prior on Charles to fully appreciate his work and everything\
  \ that he has achieved.  \n\nThe evening was so much like a scene out of \u201C\
  Midnight in Paris\u201D that I went back the next day to check the gallery existed!\n\
  \nI\u2019ve danced on stages in Rome and Argentina, blown the horn in Switzerland,\
  \ stood next to Sting to get a drink at the theatre and meeting Charles was up there\
  \ with these experiences.  There\u2019s always adventures and experiences awaiting\
  \ when you travel.\n\n\n**I would be happy to contribute to the flight cost for\
  \ the experience"
