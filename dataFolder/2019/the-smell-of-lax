Text: "It was the smell when I took my first step into the airport; maybe the dead\
  \ cigarette butts, the burnt coffee and hot McDonalds\u2019 fries, or just the jet\
  \ fuel really early in the morning. The buzzing of my luggage wheels rolling on\
  \ the wax floor, my huffing and puffing as I dashed to my exit gate, and the monotone\
  \ voice on the PA system telling me where to find the \u201Cunattended bags\u201D\
  . Perhaps it was my unexplainable anxiety as I prayed for the window seat, and the\
  \ squeaking as I finally sat and watched the never-ending video on how to put on\
  \ an airmask and find the lifejacket. Or maybe it was my favorite song, I always\
  \ play as the plane descends.\n\n\u201CPut it in your heart where tomorrow shines\n\
  \nGold and silver shine\n\nShiny happy people holding hands\n\nShiny happy people\
  \ holding hands\n\nShiny happy people laughing\u201D\n\nI watched out the window\
  \ as the captivating greenery of Ireland embraced me. The funny shapes turn into\
  \ buildings, the shadows turn into people, and the tiny almost microscopic white\
  \ dots\u2026 yeah, those are the sheep. My whole life was about to change, everything\
  \ inside me knew it.\n\n I lived in Southwest Kerry County for a few months, and\
  \ I could write a whole book about it in a heartbeat. The people, the food, the\
  \ culture, it enchants me. I fell in love with not just a person, but a people,\
  \ a place, a music, a home. I took my classes online so I didn\u2019t fall behind\
  \ in school, worked in a pub, and soaked in all that the town Ventry had to offer\
  \ me. Reflecting back, my job helped me grow tremendously. It was there, I met my\
  \ best friends.\n\nI met Dave one of my first days at work, and we quickly bonded\
  \ over all things American because he had a unique fascination for the craziness\
  \ that American culture is, he quickly became one of my closest friends. Dave was\
  \ a chef who provided me with the most unique flavors from eastern and northern\
  \ Europe combined into one. We would go out once a week to a new restaurant, pretending\
  \ in our own dreams that we were the world\u2019s finest critiques, and we would\
  \ review every single bite of food we had. A friendship based off food was probably\
  \ the best idea anyone ever had, let me tell you.\n\nMegan was definitely my best\
  \ girl friend. We worked together at Murphy\u2019s and hit it off instantly. People\
  \ would go wild when they saw us together, our energy with our friends in town was\
  \ roaring and lively.\n\nMy best friend, Shane, drove me head over heels into Irish\
  \ country culture. His mother was my boss at the pub, while he was a sheep farmer\
  \ and worked at our towns Whiskey Distillery. We spent almost everyday, every hour,\
  \ every minute together. He not only taught me how to drive stick shift, but by\
  \ the time I left Ireland, I could drive a tractor. On my free days, when he worked\
  \ at the farm, he\u2019d teach me about sheep. I learned how to shear wool, feed,\
  \ treat sheep for infections or maggots, somethings I never pictured myself doing.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t complain though, these farms were on the famous cliffs of Kerry,\
  \ hanging over the sea with the most breathtaking views in the world.\n\nOn Shane\u2019\
  s days off we would drive around for hours. He showed me every nook, crevice, and\
  \ shortcut there was in the mystic raw beauty of the rolling Irish hills. Sometimes\
  \ on our lazy days we would lay in a nearby forest, where he built a treehouse and\
  \ put up some nets in the trees. We\u2019d lay there for hours on end just talking\
  \ nonsense about life and how we came about to be. Our friendship was dynamic. \n\
  \nI could ramble endlessly over everything he showed me, and how vastly I grew from\
  \ all of my connections with everyone I met abroad. My depth as a person flourished\
  \ and I uncovered deep passions for affairs abroad. When leaving, everything I loved\
  \ about an airport devastated me. The smell I love more than anything, made me cry\
  \ most of all."
