Text: "Whenever I heard about a Carnival I pictured Rio or Venice. When I went out\
  \ that night for the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, never expected to come\
  \ across the Burial of the Sardine. \u201CJust dress in black and go out to the\
  \ street,\u201D they said. And I became a happy widow for a night.\n\nTenerife is\
  \ the biggest of the seven Canary Islands and one of the most important tourist\
  \ destinations in Spain. Although you don't really feel in Spain. I guess it\u2019\
  s a mix between knowing that you are actually in the middle of the Atlantic, much\
  \ closer to Marocco than Madrid, and the incredibly familiar Latin American vibes.\
  \ The accent of the \u201Ccanarios\u201D (Canary Ilanders) sounds closer to Venezuelan\
  \ with a pinch of Chilean, and the great offer of \u201CTeque\xF1os\u201D confirms\
  \ my point.\n\nThis island has the complete package: guaranteed sunshine on southern\
  \ beaches, a beautiful colonial town in La Laguna -UNESCO world heritage site since\
  \ 1999-, breathtaking views of a sea of clouds from the top of Teide Volcano, and\
  \ even a natural rainforest at the north in Anaga Mountains. \n\nBut what I\u2019\
  m sure I will never forget was that night. The sixth day of Santa Cruz de Tenerife\
  \ Carnival. I had just arrived when I heard about the celebration. Not knowing well\
  \ what it was about, obediently I dressed in black and went out on the street. The\
  \ first thing I remember is this group of about 5 guys all dressed in little black\
  \ dresses with fluor color wigs and fake balloon breasts. They were screaming and\
  \ fake crying \u201CTake me, oh God! She is dead!\u201D. As they passed by me I\
  \ could see huge amounts of eyeliner and broken stockings. One of them saw me and\
  \ yelled in despair \u201CHurry before it buuurns!\u201D. The streets were full\
  \ of this Sardine widows. All crying and laughing. All mourning a soon to be burn\
  \ giant cardboard Sardine.  \n\nThis bizarre and cheerful scenario was accompanied\
  \ by the sounds of a batucada (drums) played by a group of priests with huge crosses\
  \ and clerical hats. For a moment I joined a group of very sexy nuns with Hawaiian\
  \ necklaces dancing to the beat of the drums. Nearby I spotted a Pope making people\
  \ kiss his big and shiny cotillon ring, and another group of cheerful widows passed\
  \ by me with a coffin full of ice and beers. I was already feeling just like one\
  \ of the festive widows walking and dancing across Santa Cruz in the mission to\
  \ burn and bury the Sardine. \n\nI kept walking among the crowd, and customs seemed\
  \ more and more creative. A crying bride, a priest inside a confessional cabinet,\
  \ a bunch of cats, even a Statue of Liberty. And of course so many types and free\
  \ interpretations of a widow. All dancing. All crying and screaming and even fainting\
  \ for the lost of the Sardine. Suddenly I saw it, this large colorful cardboard\
  \ Sardine. It was at least 3 meters long and guarded by 8 fancy -and a bit drunk-\
  \ bishops. \n\nWhen we got to the end of the road, close to the sea, the firework\
  \ started. It wasn't too long until our beloved Sardine stared burning. All the\
  \ desperate screaming became applause and cheers. The Burial of the Sardine was\
  \ complete but the celebration kept going all night. \n\nIt was by far the best\
  \ way to discover the essence and energy of this charming island. And I will never\
  \ forget the day that I became part of the happy widow coterie, and definitely support\
  \ the aim of making Tenerife Carnival an Intangible Cultural World Heritage."
