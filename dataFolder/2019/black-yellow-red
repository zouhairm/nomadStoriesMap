Text: "There are more Irish pubs that you\u2019d expect in Brussels. As we drag our\
  \ suitcases and camping-style rucksacks towards the hostel (over in Sint-Jans-Molenbeek),\
  \ one catches my eye. I\u2019m intrigued by the way that an Irish pub can edge its\
  \ way into any city. When visiting family in Bucharest a year before, I was amazed\
  \ to see one with a crowd watching Irish Rugby. Men holding pints and \u2018ole\
  \ ole ole\u2019ing spilled onto the high-street. Nearby stood unsuspecting shoppers\
  \ with startled looks on their faces. \n\nAcross the road from Le Bourse de Bruxelles\
  \ (a colossal cream-coloured building with columns at its front and tiny steps leading\
  \ up to its entrance) is O\u2019Reilly\u2019s, painted a lurid green. Though only\
  \ eleven o\u2019clock, the neon green bar lights are on. Despite this the interior\
  \ is shadowy and still. Oddly empty. Strange against the morning sun.\n\nAround\
  \ the Boulevard Anspach, Metro subways are lined with yellow tape. Someone in our\
  \ group points out that the 2016 Terror Attacks weren\u2019t so long ago. We struggle\
  \ to remember where the bombings happened \u2013 none of us know \u2013 then drop\
  \ the topic. \n\nJust one day in Brussels. We\u2019re crossing between Amsterdam\
  \ and Paris, and don\u2019t have any plans for our time here except to try the famed\
  \ Belgian frites and waffles. Some of us have a vague idea about finding somewhere\
  \ to watch the UEFA Euro 2016 match later. Belgium vs Hungary.\n\nWe emerge in the\
  \ evening to wander down a winding cobbled alley, with red, blue and green restaurant\
  \ canopies hogging the width of the pavement. Eventually we decide on an Italian\
  \ restaurant to get dinner. As we say goodbye to the waiter, he asks us where we\u2019\
  re from. \n\nTwo days before we arrived here, we stayed up all night following the\
  \ Brexit referendum. Now, whenever someone asks us where we\u2019re from, we get\
  \ a raised eyebrow when we say the UK. Or maybe I\u2019m paranoid. \n\nAn hour before\
  \ the match, we sit in an underwhelming bar. It was the first place we could find.\
  \ Dark brown wood floor, tables, stools, ashy sofas. A huge screen taking up the\
  \ entire far wall. I sip on Duvel, as I should, supposedly, according to my friend.\
  \ An hour later, and somehow, without us really noticing, the bar is like a full\
  \ stomach. People are streaming in like rain-water through a leak. We relocate,\
  \ choosing to perch on a metal staircase closer to the screen. \n\nNormally, I hate\
  \ football. I\u2019m sorry. My attention span is too short. But the game starts.\
  \ The lights are dimmed. Onto the giant blue screen flickers the players and the\
  \ pitch. You can see the outlines of the pub-goers\u2019 faces, tentatively sketched\
  \ out by the sublime light of the TV. Hundreds of pairs of eyes glow in the dark.\
  \ So quiet. Motionless. \n\nUntil goal! And everyone hugs and punches the air and\
  \ the room ripples like quick-sand. Chants pick up speed. Belgium wins by four points\
  \ to none. \n\nPart of the crowd, we flood back outside. People are congregating\
  \ on the steps of Le Bourse de Bruxelles, weaving their way out of O\u2019Reilly\u2019\
  s, clapping, stamping, flapping the Belgian flag above their heads. Black, yellow,\
  \ red.\n\nWe can\u2019t control the wide grins fixed on our faces. One of us bought\
  \ a flag earlier in preparation, and we pause for an obligatory photo in front of\
  \ the Brussels Stock Exchange. But I gradually become aware that behind us policemen\
  \ in high vis jackets are rounding up the crowd. They stand at each corner, threatening\
  \ the group with batons. \n\nIt seems like the right moment to go. Tomorrow we have\
  \ an early train. Everyone else goes ahead and I look back, torn between wanting\
  \ to join the crowd again and wanting to get enough sleep. The mass sways as one\
  \ body. Then I turn down the road that stretches towards Molenbeek. Cars are speeding\
  \ and beeping, drivers sticking their heads out their windows, yelling \u2018la\
  \ Victoire!\u2019 The ground thuds. Rushing down the street, as it\u2019s pulsing,\
  \ we feel like we\u2019re bouncing off the pavements. Behind us, the Place de la\
  \ Bourse is still visible, alight, and I wonder: what would have happened if they\u2019\
  d lost?"
