Text: "I squinted up at grey-washed sky, then back down at my chainsaw. With another\
  \ stroke of the file it became more and more apparent that the motosierra\u2019\
  s chain teeth, as the Chilean dentist would say, were fucked. \n\nTypical Valparaiso\
  \ morning. Maybe gonna rain, but probably not. \n\nI had spent the last two weeks\
  \ at the Castillo inhaling dust, tarring the inside of my nostrils to the point\
  \ where I\u2019d have to violently exorcise myself on the hour. But that won the\
  \ toss over having the oily God-knows-how-long dustmasks buttering up my cheeks.\
  \ \n\nOur Chilean Castillo was really just a three-storey house, and a rather shabby-looking\
  \ one at that. It seemed only a \u201Ccastle\u201D in the sense that it was so heavily\
  \ fortified, adopting window bars after personal brushes with Manuel, the local\
  \ crackhead. Just last week the German family awoke to their two-metre bedroom lamp\
  \ floating towards the bars of the open window. But that's a story for another time...\n\
  \n\u201CLots of trees and nature\u201D turned out to be little more than a steep\
  \ slope with some dying succulents, desperately holding onto a shaky wasteland by\
  \ the tips of their roots. This 'garden' slope of dust and rubbish and eroded soil\
  \ made for less than reliable footing. It demanded sturdy boots, and my still-fresh-inside\
  \ hiking boots proved perfect for the task\u2014other than giving me blisters and\
  \ accommodating sticky veins of stray dog shit in the bottom. But my job was to\
  \ cut logs. Thick ones. And with a blunt chain the wood would take so long to cut,\
  \ and get so hot, it would sear the logs like I was spreading a thin layer of Marmite\
  \ on the ends. A replacement was long overdue. \n\nFor such a complex renovation\
  \ project, you would think we would be supplied with more than two screwdrivers,\
  \ and at least one of a standard size. Unfortunately, neither of these fit the bolt\
  \ for tightening the motosierra chain\u2026 \nBut alas, my days working at an island\
  \ resort in Thailand had taught me something: how to fix things without using real\
  \ tools. One time at the resort I had fixed a towel rail to the wall using the thread\
  \ of a wood screw to drive the head of another screw. This motosierra bolt had no\
  \ idea what it was in for. \n\nAnd with a smile like the Cheshire Cat, I stumbled\
  \ upon a butter knife that had been used to stir paint. A fine makeshift screwdriver\
  \ indeed. Though the little MacGyver in me patted himself on the back, outside of\
  \ me the bolt was getting difficult to wind tight enough to hold the chain at tensi\xF3\
  n \xF3ptima. It would be nice if the universe would just let me have this one, an\
  \ easy fix\u2014but my prayers were answered soon enough.\n\nPhilip\u2014my German\
  \ neighbour\u2014gifted the Castillo when he left, a fine pair of hiking pants with\
  \ a hole in the crotch. But he also gifted the Castillo something else. Something\
  \ far more special. \n\nBut one day we discovered a stone staircase hidden under\
  \ the dust and buried garbage. In clearing the path, Philip unearthed an short,\
  \ rusty bar of metal, which was only just recognisable as an old-fashioned screwdriver\u2014\
  and it just so happened that it was the perfect size for the chainsaw. \n\nBlessed\
  \ with this divine gift from centuries past, we continued God\u2019s work. In lieu\
  \ of first-world conveniences, we had Vicente the Venezuelan. We might not have\
  \ oats and potatoes as was promised, but we at least had an operational motosierra.\
  \ Life here at the Castillo was starting to look up.\n\nStill a bit at the stage\
  \ where someone will catch me off guard with a \u201C\xBFC\xF3mo est\xE1s?\u201D\
  \ and I\u2019ll nod and go \u201CSi\u201D, but we\u2019ll get there."
