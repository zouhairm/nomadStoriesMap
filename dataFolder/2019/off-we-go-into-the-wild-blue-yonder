Text: "This is about the time when my younger sister invited me on a trip to Goa.\
  \ It was my first visit to this state which is also known as \"Pearl of the Orient\"\
  . \nThe serene atmosphere and the splendor of nature  is plays vital in Goa's charm.\
  \ We reached our hotel in the afternoon and went for the water adventures right\
  \ after in the evening. I would be honest I was awestruck at first. The majestic\
  \ blue water, rythmic sound of waves, sky filled with sunset colours, liberated\
  \ souls, sunshine, wind through the primeval woods, ecstatic play of nature and\
  \ what not.\nWe enrolled ourselves for parasailing. And started to wait for our\
  \ boat to take us to the ship. As soon as it arrived, we boarded. Upon reaching\
  \ the ship, I was the second in line for my turn. The controller asked me whether\
  \ I would want to take the dip or the height. It took me a wuile to understand the\
  \ lingo but I opted for both dip and the height because I am a waterbaby, haha!\
  \  I was tied with the belts attached to the balloon. And for the next 20 minutes\
  \ I was either touching sea water with my feet or was flying high up in the sky.\
  \ Loved the experience. \nI arrived back the ship and was waiting for other people\
  \ to finish as we couldn't go back otherwise. I was looking at the sea which was\
  \ so beautiful. So this idea striked my mind as I was bored. I asked the sailor\
  \ that what happens if somebody jumps off the ship just to do a casual swimming.\
  \ They gave me a look like I was crazy enough to even ask that. But I assured them\
  \ that I know how to swim. After much convincing, they allowed me to get off the\
  \ ship into the sea. \nThe moment I got down into this deep sea off the ship, I\
  \ floated for a while as the water was cold because it was a mid October evening.\
  \ Afterwards I swam for about 30 minutes in the sea in the middle of nowhere, the\
  \ sun was setting, no noise; it was so calm and peaceful that it touched me internally.\
  \ My brain was blank and heart was thrilled. I got back onto the ship after a while\
  \ and went back to the beachside.\nThis was the most tranquil yet adventurous experience\
  \ of my travel time. I can never take that moment out of me ever. And I am thankful\
  \ to myself that I took the risk as it was WORTH IT!"
