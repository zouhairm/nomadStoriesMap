Text: "20 hours inside of the bus, definitely not first class seats, noisy schoolchildren\
  \ and cockroaches. Being an average exchange student mean all these things. Adventures\
  \ on a budget bring you closer. Finally we are in Salta, a small town in the North\
  \ of Argentina surrounded by mountains.  Almost all the small Argentinean \"pueblos\"\
  \ which is somewhat between a towns and a village look pretty the same, but Salta\
  \ has its very own thing: fresh mountain air, famous empanadas also known as salte\xF1\
  as, excellent local beer and drugstores selling coca leaves.  \n\nAnyway it's time\
  \ to go to the moon. Visas to Bolivia were too easy to obtain at the local consulate\
  \ office, as applicants only happen occasionally. I travelled with my friend, a\
  \ girl, 8 inches taller than me, with absolutely no physical similarity between\
  \ us except for the hair colour and gender. Apparently last two features seemed\
  \ rather important to the officer as he wrote my last name into her visa, which\
  \ made us officially sisters in Bolivia. Well why not? He said there would not be\
  \ any problem.  \n\nNext 3 days were dedicated to meeting northern towns of Argentina.\
  \ Tilcara\u2019s cactus jungles, 7 coloured hills of Purmamarca and a curvy road\
  \ to the tiny village of Iruya are must visit on your way to salt flats. You can\
  \ see how faces and accents are gradually changing with each kilometer. Finally\
  \ we are at the Bolivian border. Having wondered for a little on the streets of\
  \ Villaz\xF3n, bolivian border town we decided on moving on and go directly to Uyuni.\
  \ One of the minibus drivers that were all around the border agreed to take us right\
  \ to Tupiza, next transition point. \n\nOne hour and a half of exotic rainless mountain\
  \ road accompanied by lovely andean folk music. Yes, that was a plan. Apparently\
  \ 30 minutes later our driver decided on taking part in the national drivers strike\
  \ and pleasantly asked us to leave the bus in the middle of dusty deserted mountains.\
  \ Here is a useful tip: if you are planning to follow the same route through the\
  \ Andes make sure you have enough water supply  and your sunscreen on just in case\
  \ you get stuck there somewhen at midday, when the sun is just at its highest point.\
  \ Our story finished happily, having walked for about a kilometer we found out that\
  \ we were not the only abandoned tourists. While figuring out what to do, the savior\
  \ acting through a local farmer appeared. He generously agreed to give us a ride.\
  \ Never had I thought before I could be that delighted about getting on an open\
  \ trail begrimed with dust. The off-road track was something between Dakar and roller\
  \ coaster. \nIn two days of serpentine roads we got to Uyuni, a small town with\
  \ low-paced lifestyle and colorful markets. It\u2019s said that in Aymara, the language\
  \ of the local indigenous nation, Uyuni means the point of enclosure. Here you can\
  \ take a tour to the salt flats, the place I had been dreaming about so much. A\
  \ typical tour is 3-4 days long in a group of 4-5 people. You get to see a cemetery\
  \ of trains that were used mainly for mining, you sleep in a hotel totally made\
  \ of salt and then you see a masterpiece of nature: bright coral color lagoon with\
  \ hundreds of graceful flamencos and a herd of adorable llamas wearing festive bright\
  \ ribbons walking around, llamas that look so charming that you can never imagine\
  \ them being brought on a plate later.\n   That moment, standing there I realized\
  \ that I had never seen anything of this kind before, majestic combination of colours\
  \ with exceptionally optimized brightness and contrast. It is some kind of idyllic\
  \ harmony that is just hovering over there and you need nothing else. As the flats\
  \ are extremely wide, it is quite easy to avoid other tourists and enjoy the moment\
  \ of being unified with nature, in the middle of this surrealistic scenery. In the\
  \ language of Aymara people face past and have their back to the future as they\
  \ can not see it. I can see the past of Aymara nation now, and it is amazing."
