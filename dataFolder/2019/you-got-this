Text: "It\u2019s crazy, feeling the uncertainty build up in you, the anxiety, the\
  \ doubts. Your mind is going a million miles an hour, why did I decide to do this?\
  \ Is it to late to back out? \nI\u2019ve never been a follower but more so a lone\
  \ wolf, an adventure seeker, a risk taker, so that\u2019s what I did, I took a risk\
  \ but someone who suffers severe anxiety, was this risk even to big for me?\nI decided\
  \ to travel to Nepal by myself, not really knowing what to expect but mentally preparing\
  \ myself as best I could. I love travelling, I love stepping into the unknown but\
  \ nothing could prepare me for this. \nKathmandu airport was small, made of brick,\
  \ people crowded everywhere, yelling, trying to find their bags and of course starring\
  \ at me, this frazzled lost blonde girl. I finally got my bags and it was late by\
  \ then, I walked outside and was welcomed with loud shouting, \u201Ctaxi?! Taxi??\
  \ Taxi?!\u201D. I finally chose my driver and off we went, to the town of Kathmandu.\
  \ It was dark and I couldn\u2019t see much, all I remember is feeling nervous and\
  \ couldn\u2019t believe how crazy the roads were, a part of me wanted to shut my\
  \ eyes, but I couldn\u2019t look away. \nThat night I went to sleep with the noises\
  \ of Kathmandu and the feeling of uncertainty of what I was getting myself into.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019ll never forget my first morning in Nepal, I never realised my heart\
  \ could feel so full. I walked out to streets full of prayer flags, of beautiful\
  \ people saying \u201Cnamaste\u201D with smiles in their eyes. There was just so\
  \ much damage to this city yet so much love and so much beauty. The fallen down\
  \ houses from the earthquakes, the homeless who still had so much kindness to give,\
  \ the Buddha\u2019s, even the smell, it was so unique, I couldn\u2019t believe how\
  \ lucky I felt to be in this country, how much I wanted to help. \n\nI remember\
  \ driving on a rickety bus to Pokhara with people I\u2019d only just met, preparing\
  \ myself for my 10 day hike of the Annapurna circuit, not knowing what to expect\
  \ or who I would meet. Those 10 days went quicker than I ever expected. I walked\
  \ through forests, waterfalls, towns filled with hope and desperation. I cried with\
  \ locals, then I danced with them as we drank rum in the dark, because the power\
  \ in the town had gone out. In that moment I felt my soul whisper back to me \u201C\
  I\u2019m happy, this is where I need to be, this is home.\u201D I opened my heart\
  \ on this trek, it taught me a lot as a person and I also gained a family out of\
  \ it. \n\nI spent one month in Nepal and although it was no way near long enough\
  \ I could write a whole book about it. It changes you, it every way possible, and\
  \ it leaves you wanting more. \nThe emotion you feel, the beauty you see in a country\
  \ that is struggling, it helps shape you. \nI would suggest to anyone to give this\
  \ country a go. Hike, volunteer, drink, eat, dance under the stars, go and find\
  \ yourself."
