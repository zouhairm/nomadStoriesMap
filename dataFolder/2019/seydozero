Text: "One day my father decided to make an expedition to the very hidden place of\
  \ Northwest of Russia, the very heart of the Kola Peninsula Lake Seyd - Seydozero.\
  \ Lake Seydozero, hidden in the mountains. If the day is sunny, then the silver\
  \ expanse of the lake, covered with sheer cliffs, is calm and affable. \nI have\
  \ not heard about any of the lakes so much legends and myths as about Seydozero.\
  \ For the Sami people this is a religious and cult place.\n\nYears and years ago\
  \ everyone knew that the Sami had a miraculous lake - full of fish, crystal clear\
  \ holy water and pure energy that can cure you from anything, but no one knew how\
  \ to get there.\n\nUfology enthusiasts consider the Seydozero area a unique biogenic\
  \ zone. And that snowman also lives there. The water in the lake is so pure, that,\
  \ perhaps, cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Environmentalists, taking\
  \ samples from Seydozero and making water analysis, found out: here the water is\
  \ not conditionally clean, but absolutely clean. Drink - you will never get enough\
  \ of it!\n\nSeydozero one of the most mystical places in Russia. Legends and scientists\
  \ say that this place was an ancient civilization \u2013 Hyperborea, the sacred\
  \ land similar to Atlantis. And this lake is located in the millstone of an extinct\
  \ volcano. These mountains are 350 million years old! The water there is clean as\
  \ a tear, the lake is deep, but the bottom is visible and all the multi-colored\
  \ pebbles in it. \nSami considered the lake a special place where you can go only\
  \ by necessity to ask for advice, a Spiritual guidance. Now not every tourist would\
  \ want to go there because to reach the magical lake you need to go through gloomy\
  \ dangerous pass, and it can take you up to 13 hours hike if you won\u2019t get\
  \ lost.\nSpirits and gods of ancient civilizations live there. Therefore, you should\
  \ always appease the spirits and bring gifts, like coins or gemstones, and ask for\
  \ permission for everything you do and be very careful where you step onto. \n\n\
  Then the day came, the car landed us at the foot of the mountains, and we set off\
  \ on a 13-hour trek to the lake with huge backpacks. We planned to stay at the lake\
  \ for a week.\n\nWith us in the campaign was one man - Sergey, who was very skeptical\
  \ of all these legends. He did not stop complaining and grinning at all the delusional\
  \ nature of this idea of spirits and respects of the nature. The first few days\
  \ he made fun and complained about it, was littering around, breaking the trees.\
  \ Then one evening we were all sitting by the fire and talking, telling tales and\
  \ legends about the lake. Sergey began to laugh out loud at us and said that we,\
  \ all children, believe in miracles and spirits. And he went to sleep in a tent.\
  \ There is almost no wind on this lake and there was a warm August summer evening.\
  \ But if a wind breaks through the gorge, it roars, foams, buzzes. And God forbid\
  \ being at such a time on the lake, the boat will be smashed into pieces. All of\
  \ a sudden, the flame flashed brighter and moved to the tents, the first tent caught\
  \ fire rapidly and eagerly absorbing the contents, we tried to stop the flame, but\
  \ it did not give in, the wind increased. And here we heard a scream, Sergey was\
  \ in this tent! He could not get out of the tent because of the fire. We began to\
  \ pull out blankets from other tents to put out the flames. Finally, Sergei burst\
  \ out of the tent completely burned. We barely extinguished the fire. \nSergey survived\
  \ but burned.\n\nWas Sergey being punished for the disrespect he showed towards\
  \ the sacred place? \nWhat would you contribute to protect the nature and wildlife?\n\
  I wish we all will respect and protect the world around us, like Sami people and\
  \ its spirits protected Seydozero."
