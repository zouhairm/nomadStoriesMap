Text: 'Maybe I''m a lucky dame because I never expected the real trip would start
  just the last day in Tokyo.  To say goodbye to the country i decided to cut my hair
  like Princess Comet.  My hair was long, it  really was long and I remember telling
  my boyfriend really? do we have time before the flight?  That was the most expensive
  haircut of our lives. We combine love and Tokyo and the result was portrayed as
  in slow motion: an airline stewardess was doing signs with her gentle hand, The
  plane went away! The song of Stereo Total Tokyo mon amour was real. Already Spent
  all the money, My boyfriend was talking to someone from the airline while I was
  taking care of the suitcases. We had the purchases of the Japanese teapot, the amazing
  dragon-stamped t-shirts! Last day in Tokyo? And he saw me from afar projecting with
  his gesture Relax baby be cool. That''s when I realized. This journey is just beginning!
  After staying in a hostel nice with jacuzzi we find one cheap saturated with the
  smell of wet towels. We planned picnics in the nearby parks, but now with beer 4
  times cheaper, it was no longer the cost of the bars that the tourist flyers offered.
  We leave the known and walk aimlessly, We ate in pedestrian bridges, we were following
  vagabonds in bike.  We met local karaokes and we sang only you of Elvis Presley
  with people of 50 years even more smiling than us. It was definitely the best experience
  I could have of going from something controlled to trusting the relax bb b cool
  so far from home.'
