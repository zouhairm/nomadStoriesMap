Text: "After a devastating car accident killing her husband and unborn child, Fiona\
  \ decides to leave it all. She comes to Portugal to be in silence as she goes through\
  \ the five stages of grieving. With each passing day, she tries to take herself\
  \ out of her depressed isolation state into a world she's never experienced. The\
  \ sunshine on her skin begins to give her life and the people she passes bring a\
  \ smile to her face. \n\nAs Fiona connects to the city, the culture, and ways of\
  \ inner peace, she meets Cole. He has also come to Portugal to escape his stage\
  \ four cancer diagnosis. The doctors gave him a year to live, but his health has\
  \ been declining rapidly. Rather than die in a cold, hospital bed, he takes his\
  \ life savings and travels the world. Portugal is the beginning of his journey and\
  \ the first step to truly living before dying.  \n\nFiona and Cole connect through\
  \ tragedy to heal mentally, spiritually, and physically until it's time to part\
  \ ways. Cole continues his adventure through Europe while Fiona returns home to\
  \ put her life back together. One year later, they planned to meet again in Portugal.\
  \ Cole leaves a letter to Fiona to the coffee shop they frequented telling her he\
  \ couldn't make it and he left the rest of his life savings to her to continue his\
  \ journey. In the envelope is his passport with stamps, foreign money, papers of\
  \ where he planned to go next, and a picture of them smiling the year prior. At\
  \ that moment, Fiona begins her life as a digital nomad and fulfills Cole's dying\
  \ wish."
