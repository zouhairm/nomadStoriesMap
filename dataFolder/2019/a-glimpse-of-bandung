Text: "When you are considering a trip to Indonesia, Bandung might not be on your\
  \ top list to spend your vacations. People still choose Bali or Yogyakarta as their\
  \ main list. Firstly, how to get Bandung? The highland city of Bandung is located\
  \ in West Java province. It\u2019s only a short 3 hours drive southeast of Jakarta\
  \ via toll road and is the overwhelming destination of choice for Jakarta residents\
  \ to get away for weekends and long holidays. You could also reach Bandung by taking\
  \ a bus or train. People usually come here to enjoy it\u2019s nature and delicious\
  \ local dishes to old\u2013style dutch cuisine. You don\u2019t have to worry about\
  \ the accomodations, because abundance of hotels offering it\u2019s service from\
  \ the luxury five-stars one to the budget rooms one. \n\nHigh volcanic peaks, hot\
  \ springs and tea plantations are some place to visit if you're bored with the city\
  \ life and all of them are all within reach. Secondly, Which place would i recommend\
  \ you to visit?\n\n1. Kawah putih. located in south Bandung, kawah putih also known\
  \ as white crater. It is one place that you can\u2019t miss out when visiting bandung.\
  \ White sands and crystal clears waters will make you feel like you are being teleported\
  \ to magical place. This crater was formed after mount patuha erupted. According\
  \ to the weather conditions, the colour of water could changes from blue to light\
  \ torquise. this stunning lake is highly acidic so do not even think about dipping\
  \ your toes into the water. \n\n2. Tangkuban Parahu. 25 kilometers north of Bandung\
  \ directions of Lembang. this is one of the most famous tourist place to visit.\
  \ Tangkuban Parahu means, literally \"up-turned boat\" This peculiar shape has stimulated\
  \ the fantasy of the Sundanese people from early times as expressed in the legend\
  \ of Sangkuriang.\nTangkuban parahu is an active volcano that last erupted  in 2015.\
  \ the volcano offers many place to see and explore. there are three main crater\
  \ in tangkuban parahu. these are: Kawah Ratu (Queen Crater), Kawah Domas (Domas\
  \ Crater), and Kawah Upas (Upas Crater). you can go down into the Domas Crater and\
  \ boil eggs in here. \n\n3. Ciater natural hot springs. 30 minutes drives from tangkuban\
  \ parahu, we could find a nice natural hot springs park with small pools in which\
  \ we can sit or swim. Ciater is pretty little place in the middle of huge tea estate.\
  \ Its main attraction is the Sari Ater Hot Spring Resort. this place also has a\
  \ tea factory and a good starting point if you want to go for hiking.\n\nthere are\
  \ so many places and things such as foods, arts and cultures that you can get from\
  \ discovering Bandung. if this beautiful city has never crossed your mind as a vacations\
  \ destination, i feel that you've put this hidden gems of Indonesia on your travel\
  \ list."
