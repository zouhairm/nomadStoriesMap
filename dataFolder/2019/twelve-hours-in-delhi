Text: "Sunila, Ramesh and Baljeet waved me off like we\u2019d know each other for\
  \ months.  The last fourteen days travelling through India and Nepal had been surreal\
  \ and this final mini adventure in Delhi left me grateful and unexpectedly tipsy.\
  \ I ran to my boarding gate.\n\nBaljeet flagged me down to his taxi outside of Indira\
  \ Gandhi International Airport. With my last twelve hours to fill he assured me\
  \ he\u2019d show me the sights of Delhi with ample time to board my flight home\
  \ to Melbourne, all at a fair price.\n\nI\u2019d just finished venturing through\
  \ Kathmandu, Lumbini, Chitwan, Varanasi, Agra, Delhi, back to Kathmandu and again\
  \ back to Delhi.  My pre planned Contiki tour was set off course on day one.  In\
  \ a hotel courtyard in Kathmandu I fell in lust with a UN photographer.  What transpired\
  \ was the abandonment of visiting the Agra Fort and touring Delhi for three days\
  \ to instead spend more time in Thamel with Robel from Eritrea.  \n\nIt quickly\
  \ became obvious that Baljeet was always hoping to make a few extra dollars.  On\
  \ our first stop I was ushered around a store and presented with handicrafts, silk\
  \ pashminas and saris; all of best quality and price. This advantageous nature was\
  \ definitely not something I admired in Indians. I needed a cigarette - a sure way\
  \ to escape the pressure of buying something. Instead I was handed an ashtray and\
  \ matches. Amused by the absurdity of the situation, I smoked the cigarette, held\
  \ the ashtray awkwardly and walked around like a pompous Westerner. \n\u2018This\
  \ is not what I meant when I said I wanted to explore the markets of Delhi.\u2019\
  \ \nWhere was the ancient Chandni Chowk or Dilli Haat I had read about? \n\nOnce\
  \ back in his car Baljeet realised his attempts to make commissions from me would\
  \ be fruitless and our conversation began to flow more effortlessly.  He asked me\
  \ about my life and shared his with me.  He was 32, married and had two children\
  \ aged 6 and 8.  I was a single 31 year old teacher who\u2019d just finished a tour\
  \ with a group of people I\u2019d never met and was not even contemplating marriage.\
  \  We laughed about how vastly different we were despite our similar ages. Nonetheless\
  \ we discovered that we both desired a real sense of freedom, loved embracing every\
  \ moment and making real connections.\n\n\u2018You like to drink?\u2019  \n\u2018\
  Sure, why not\u2019 I said; the humidity adding weight to the idea.  Cocktails,\
  \ air conditioning and more conversing seemed a much nicer way to pass the time.\
  \ I was done being harassed for more Indian Rupees. \n\u2018I\u2019ll be back\u2019\
  \ \nConfused I watched a group of men staring at me as Baljeet walked past them\
  \ into a local shop. Five minutes later he returned carrying lemon soft drink, a\
  \ bottle of Vodka and two plastic cups. The nonsensicality had just gone up a notch!\
  \ He drove on, parked on the side of a busy freeway somewhere in Delhi and poured\
  \ us both a drink. \n\u2018Cheers!\u2019  \nWe drank and shared more stories as\
  \ the car sped past us with the air conditioning on. \n\nMindful that we couldn\u2019\
  t spend the next seven hours drinking in his car he decided I should meet his friends-\
  \ Sunila and Ramesh. Sunila lived in the midst of hundreds of identical apartment\
  \ buildings.   Ramesh paid the rent since she was his mistress.  Accustomed now\
  \ to another unexpected experience I embraced the opportunity to find out more about\
  \ their relationship.  Although I felt empathy for his wife they truly were in love.\
  \  Sharing more vodka we all explored the struggle of the practice of arranged marriage\
  \ and the loveless relationships it produced. \n\nNow old friends there was one\
  \ last stop before my return to the airport -Baljeet\u2019s house. The four of us\
  \ drove to the outskirts of Delhi. In the heat women worked the fields, their faces\
  \ covered by their shawls to keep them anonymous to prying eyes.  \n\nFor those\
  \ last few hours, long after the vodka was finished Baljeet, Sunila, Ramesh and\
  \ I deepened our understanding of not only the many similarities we shared but of\
  \ ourselves and our humanity.  \n\nAt my boarding gate I caught my breath and smiled."
