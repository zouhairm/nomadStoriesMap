Text: "I got myself out of the tent, fell down to my knees, I was vomiting and crying\
  \ at the same time. Sounds awful? But hey, it was 4000m above the sea level! Under\
  \ the sky full of bright stars at Central Caucasus after reaching both of the summits\
  \ of Mount Elbrus. Is this the right feeling being on high mountain? I couldn\u2018\
  t believe that! I wasn't the only one who was sick, diarrhea and vomiting tortured\
  \ every second person from our team. Night was agonizing. In the morning I was drinking\
  \ Rehidrol, and any pills just to feel better.  Climbing on Elbrus showed me what\
  \ does mean thinned air and body overload. So weak and at the same time so strong\
  \ I hadn\u2019t felt in my life.\n\nIn the mountains, the human body begins to feel\
  \ lack of oxygen around 2,500m. Feelings taken over by the difference in height\
  \ are very individual regardless of gender, physical preparedness, weight,  age.\n\
  \nOn August 4, at 3:00am with headlamp, the crampons on my boots and full backpack\
  \ of food I was one of 26 people from Latvia who were heading to the West summit\
  \ of Elbrus (5642m).  Southern route  isn\u2019t technically complicated - a well-worn\
  \ trail snaked in the direction of the peak. The overall pace of the team was unexpectedly\
  \ fast, we were worried about the weather. Several times crampoons fell of my left\
  \ boot. I pulled them up harder. Here I started to lag behind of my team. At the\
  \ cliffs of Pastuhov  I saw the first rays of sunshine, they reflected on the firn.\
  \  I felt that my heels started to hurt because of the crampoons, but they could\
  \ not be loosened, then they would fall again. \n\nAt first, my pace was 80 steps\
  \ and then a little rest. There were a lot of climber groups on the way up. Some\
  \ of them tried to reach the summit without acclimatization, they moved very slowly,\
  \ so I needed to outpace them. With great difficulty after passing 2 or 3 groups,\
  \ I become angry with myself, the ascent wasn\u2019t so steep, but why i couldn\u2019\
  t move? My legs felt heavy, and my lungs desperately wanted an oxygen. I was slowing\
  \ down, but I tried as much as I could! I noticed 2 people already coming down.\
  \ \u201CLucky\u201D, I thought\u2026 But actually it was a rescuer who was carrying\
  \ down a climber without ability to orientate. He was staggering, taken in a short\
  \ rope. Damn! I can\u2019t give up! I started focusing on counting steps. I did\
  \ not get farther than 35 steps. I felt like participating in a marathon...in slow\
  \ motion and breathing through the cocktail straw. 35 steps more... Before the climb\
  \ my team had an idea to climb on both summits of Mont Elbrus. The difference of\
  \ height is only 20m, and the rout  of East summit goes from the saddleback. 35\
  \ steps more, heavy and loudly grasping for the air\u2026\u201DHell no, it will\
  \ be enough with W peak! \u201C \n\n8:40am, after 5 hours I met my teammate, \u201C\
  Well kido, this is your Mont Elbrus!\u201D He told. Yes\u2026 it was, I was standing\
  \ on the highest point of Europe! Exhausted. We took a bunch of pictures and hurried\
  \ down. Fortunately, going down is much easier and faster than going up. And feeling\
  \ this lightness, the hardships that have just passed are forgotten, and the thought\
  \ of the second summit creeps into my head. \u201CI'll never forgive myself if I\
  \ will not try! \u2026 \u201CBut you know how hard it will be!\u201D This discussion\
  \ in my head was alive until the saddleback, where suddenly somebody asked me,\u201D\
  \ You will go up? \u201C and the first word of my mouth, which flew out was \u201C\
  Yes\u201D\u2026\n\nAt lunchtime I was in our base camp, congratulating each other.\
  \ Only then my appetite appeared. I ate chocolate with Latvian black bread, potato\
  \ mash with meat and cookies. As You know, at night I  got rid of everything I had\
  \ eaten\u2026 I'm not ashamed to say that this was the toughest thing I've done\
  \ so far, I reached  my limit, but we all know that more exciting life is behind\
  \ the limits."
