Text: "I have left my cell phone behind.  The most advanced piece of technology I\
  \ have is a flashlight.  The language is Swahili.  The continent is Africa.  The\
  \ country is Tanzania, and the mission is simple; make it to the top.  Six days\
  \ up, and 2 days down.  The first known person to summit Mount KIlimanjaro was Hans\
  \ Meyer in 1889.  My name is Michael Blakey, and the year is 2018.  \n\n\tAs I leave\
  \ from Londrosi Trailhead (Elevation 2369 meters), my senses are invaded, and I\
  \ welcome the intruders with pleasure.  The sounds of mother nature bring my soul\
  \ to life.  The alpine chads chirp, the sun peaks through the trees, and the blue\
  \ monkeys bounce from limb to limb as I walk \u201Cpole pole\u201D (slowly slowly)\
  \ up the mountain towards Mti Kubwa \u201CBig Tree\u201D (Elevation 2895 meters).\
  \  The Impatiens kilimanjarii, mountain gladious, and ever lasting flower bloom\
  \ with excitement providing the already luscious green landscape with an accompaniment\
  \ of beautiful colors.  \n\n\tIn a split second, the tree line was suddenly at eye\
  \ level, and the rain forest became a thing of the past.  The vegetation zone I\
  \ have entered is called Moorland.  As I make my way to Shira Camp 1 (Elevation\
  \ 3505 meters), I feel like I am in a  completely different universe than where\
  \ I was yesterday.  The green rainforest slowly dissipated while vast open plains\
  \ and rolling hills came into my line of sight.  All of this happening so quickly,\
  \ I worry if I close my eyes for too long I would miss a vegetation zone.  The blue\
  \ monkeys and impatiens kilimanjari are no longer present at this elevation as I\
  \ venture towards Shira Camp 2 (Elevation 3850 meters).   My friends in mother nature\
  \ are now the quick moving two horned chameleons and the prickly but pretty protea\
  \ flower.  The protea flower is also the national flower for South Africa.\n\n\t\
  The wind blows strongly in this massive plain where two volcanoes stood long ago.\
  \  I see what looks to be a massive pineapple in the distance.  This alien looking\
  \ cactus tree is the Dendrosenecio kilimanjari (giant groundsel).  These \u201C\
  trees\u201D can only be found on Kili at an elevation of 4000 meters.  They are\
  \ very prevalent in Baranca Camp (Elevation 3976 meters).  The green luscious landscapes\
  \ from the rainforest returns, but in a slightly different form as the rocky hills\
  \ and open plains from Moorland disappear into the past.  The giant groundsels pop\
  \ up like ground hogs in spring and are as visible as far as the eye can see.  The\
  \ sounds of a flowing stream peacefully enters my ears.  I have entered yet another\
  \ new world.    \n\n\tTwenty four hours later and I am sitting on what feels like\
  \ the edge of the world.  For the first time during this journey, the clouds are\
  \ looking up at me.  I am currently at Karanga Valley Camp (Elevation 3995 meters).\
  \  The endless cactus patch is now a blue sky filled with fluffy clouds that seems\
  \ to go on forever.  Kili sleeps silently behind me as I stare into this deep unknown\
  \ without a care in the world.  The journey to Barafu Base Camp (Elevation 4976\
  \ meters) was an eery but welcoming experience.  My footsteps echo for miles with\
  \ each step sounding like pottery shattering in a library.  I feel as if I am walking\
  \ through the badlands in the Lion King where the hyenas lived.  \n\n\tThe clouds\
  \ have disguised my final destination.  She may not be within my sight, but she\
  \ is definitely within my grasp as I stand at the base dreaming of Uhuru Peak (Elevation\
  \ 5895 meters).  A journey through the night with words spoken only to keep myself\
  \ awake. Pole pole I continue up the mountain.  The night is so black, I only see\
  \ where I walk.  The stars are so close I feel like I can touch them.  The sunrise\
  \ at this elevation brings a tear to my eye.   Five hours in the dark and three\
  \ hours with the sun; I have finally reached the roof of Africa.  One must view\
  \ life in the way Kilimanjaro is approached; slowly, patiently, and with an open\
  \ heart and mind."
