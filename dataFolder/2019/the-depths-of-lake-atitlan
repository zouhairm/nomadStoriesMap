Text: "I hadn\u2019t noticed how huge the lake was when we crammed into the little\
  \ boat the previous morning, the sun shining down and sparkling the deep blue water\
  \ around us. Now as we crossed the eerily grey lake at 6 o\u2019clock the following\
  \ morning, all I could think was how our bodies would never have been found, how\
  \ quickly any attempt at a search party would have been called off and how nobody\
  \ would have ever known what happened to the two English girls who went missing\
  \ on Lake Atitl\xE1n in August 2018.\n\nThe day before, we took a day trip from\
  \ Santa Cruz to San Marcos, a hippy town north of the lake. We spent the day exploring\
  \ the dusty streets lined with  stalls selling jewellery and spices. Eventually,\
  \ we stretched out on some rocks near the water where we sunbathed for a few hours.\
  \ Tanya found a leaflet advertising a weaving demonstration in nearby San Juan that\
  \ she was desperate to go to. It was only 4 o\u2019clock, so off we went.\n\nSan\
  \ Juan was nothing like San Marcos. At first, we liked that there weren\u2019t many\
  \ tourists around; it felt like we were venturing off the beaten track. We made\
  \ our way to the women\u2019s collective, where we learned how the cotton was picked\
  \ and dyed with natural dyes, before it was weaved using a handmade loom. The demonstration\
  \ was wonderful and we pondered around the gift shop for an hour or so afterwards,\
  \ admiring everything the women had made.\n\nWe then walked around the town two\
  \ or three times, up the many dead-ended side streets, trying desperately to find\
  \ a restaurant that wasn\u2019t barren and boarded-up. Really this should have been\
  \ when we got on a boat home. Except, even if we had then gone to the pier, we would\
  \ have missed the last boat that day. Of course, we didn\u2019t know this. The sun\
  \ hadn\u2019t yet set and our quest for dinner was the only thing on our minds.\
  \ \n\nWe sat in a dimly lit booth inside a restaurant, unaware that outside the\
  \ day was getting darker and the streets emptier. Anxiousness began to creep up\
  \ on us when our phones ran out of battery and we realised we weren\u2019t entirely\
  \ certain of the boat times back to Santa Cruz. We fast-paced to the pier at 7pm,\
  \ but it may as well have been the middle of the night. No one was around, apart\
  \ from a group of Guatemalan men who waited in their rickshaws by the water, watching\
  \ as we walked towards them.\n\n\u201CCuando es el pr\xF3ximo barco?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  El \xFAltimo fue a las cinco y media. No hay m\xE1s.\u201D\n\nI was now more than\
  \ aware of the number of men surrounding us. Rather than the 15 quetzales it should\
  \ have cost, they suggested we crossed the lake with them for 800 quetzales. Panic\
  \ hit me in the stomach and rose like nausea up my throat. I had absolutely no idea\
  \ what we were going to do.\n\nBetween us we had enough on our travel cards, but\
  \ the last thing we wanted to do was get in a boat with these men. We turned back\
  \ up the hill, trying desperately to escape the terrifying situation we now faced.\
  \ They followed in their rickshaws, urging us to hop in so they could drive us out\
  \ of town to a nearby cash point. Tears were streaming down my face as we ran along\
  \ the dark, deserted streets. I remembered the signs for Hotel Maya, an abandoned-looking\
  \ hotel we had seen whilst looking for food earlier in the evening and so there\
  \ we hurried.\n\nI don\u2019t think there were any other guests at Hotel Maya. The\
  \ doors had no locks and the sheets were scratchy and clearly unchanged since the\
  \ guests before us. But we weren\u2019t outside anymore; we weren\u2019t in an unlit\
  \ boat crossing a dark lake. The owner had insisted it was dangerous to cross the\
  \ lake at night and told us of the many reports of violence. We were shaken up,\
  \ but we were okay. First thing, we headed to the pier; relieved to escape San Juan\
  \ and the night we would never forget."
