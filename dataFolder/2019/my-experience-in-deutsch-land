Text: "I was an over protected child, who had never been out of the Kathmnadu valley\
  \ without my parents. It was surprising to know that my 'German Nepal Travel Story'\
  \ had won 6 weeks scholarship to Deutschland. My family permitted  me to go. \n\
  I lacked knowledge of Deutsch language; relatives told me that I would be received\
  \ by people holding play-card with my name. With great enthusiasm, I boarded the\
  \ Lufthansa's flight. There was a big screen that showed us flying across the Pacific\
  \ Ocean. Nepal is land locked country, and I had never seen an ocean, so I requested\
  \ the elderly man near the window, \" Sir could you let me see the Pacific Ocean?\"\
  \ He replied, 'we are flying miles above, you cannot see the ocean\u2019. Then,\
  \ I realized my foolishness.\n     After landing at Frankfurt, I wondered, how could\
  \ an airport be so big? after going through the process. There was no one with the\
  \ play-card. I took my papers to a receptionist, who told me that I was to go to\
  \ Staufen; and take a subway.  What was a sub-way? I had no idea,  Oh! What was\
  \ I to do? She pointed at the underground stairs, and became busy. Sadly, I trudged\
  \ downstairs,  I had no idea which train to take or where to go? I sat on my rucksack\
  \ and cried, as passersby stared.\n            A  lady came up to me, I showed her\
  \ the  paper and she said at 8 am a train would come and I could reach Mainz and\
  \ take another train. She was about to leave, when I held her hand and did not let\
  \ her go. Her husband tried to pull her away,  finally, both accompanied up to Mainz,\
  \ and put me into another train and told me to get down after half an hour, and\
  \  take train to Staufen.  I sat on my rucksack near the doorway of the train, waiting\
  \ for half an hour to pass. \n      An  officer came and spoke in Deutsch, got angry\
  \ and went inside. A young person with long golden hair came to the door and said,\
  \ 'do not sit near the door, its dangerous.' I showed the paper, Oh!  Staufen  is\
  \ where we live; the hostel is near by. There I met Mrs Goo  an Anthropologist at\
  \ Freiberg,  she said, her son would come, and the golden haired person whom I thought\
  \ a girl was 'Ramin' her son. \n        I reached Staufen Hostel safely. I had a\
  \ lovely room, but was shocked to see, boys in the same hostel.  At around 8 pm\
  \  there was knock at my door, I opened  and saw  short haired  boy.  I shouted,\
  \ No boy in my room. The the person said, I am Anne from England. Oh! Another mistake;\
  \ I had mistaken Ramin for a girl and Anne for a boy.  \n           Staufen was\
  \ a small sleepy town, but for me it was an advanced city. Before I left for Deutschland\
  \ relatives told me to have 'Black Forest Cake'. One day while returning from the\
  \ language class; I saw a restaurant with the cake. I went inside and bought a big\
  \ piece for 5 DM. and went to my hostel, and took a bite. Ekhh ! The cake smelt\
  \ of alcohol. It cost me Nepali Rs 4oo, by the time I ate half,  I was drowsy and\
  \ as I ate the whole piece, I fell in deep slumber. In the morning I told Anne,\
  \ about it , and she told me, that the restaurant sold ' sweets, cakes with alcohol'.\n\
  \          One day I was at Ramen's house helping Mrs Goo in the kitchen, I saw\
  \ a  golden box  of colourful sweets, without asking, I was about eat one, When\
  \ Ramin shouted ' Do not eat it, it is detergent balls for the washing machine'.\
  \  both laughed, while I felt like a fool.\n           Another incident was getting\
  \ lost in the Schwarzwald forest, while eating  berries, and how I fell down the\
  \ escalator at the airport and many tumbled after me.\n          What an experience\
  \ in a country that had different culture and advanced technology. Now I can laugh\
  \ at my mistakes, however,  it remains an indelible memory in an album of my life."
