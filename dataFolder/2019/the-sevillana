  \ \n\nFeria de Abril, once a reason for neighbors to trade livestock in Seville,\
  \ has transformed into a demonstration of fashion, wealth and dance skills. The\
  \ streets of the city are filled with horse drawn carriages headed to the festival,\
  \ while tourists flash their cameras as they ride by. \n\nAs I walk through the\
  \ large decorated portada, an archway marking the start of the Feria grounds, it\
  \ finally hit me that after years of being a foreigner here, I finally entered a\
  \ realm of Spanish tradition I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d experience as an outsider.\n\
  \nThe roads of the festival are lined with big and small casetas alike, tents that\
  \ act more like a bar (housing a kitchen, dance floor and tables all in one). Each\
  \ are labeled with a number and name, most of them privately owned for generations.\
  \ There is an exclusivity to Feria. \n\nLuckily, my friend Marina had extended the\
  \ invite to join their family in celebrating inside their private caseta \u2014\
  \ a privilege compared to the public casetas filled with drunk teenagers and tourists\
  \ taking photos. \n\nOutside the path of casetas are cabelleros, both young and\
  \ old, in their traditional flat rimmed cowboy hats, sitting high on top of their\
  \ horses with a sense of pride that only Feria can bring out. Behind almost every\
  \ caballero, a woman is sitting side saddle in her tight, colorful flamenco dress.\
  \ You are transported to a simpler time. \n\nThanks to Marina\u2019s generosity,\
  \ I was able to borrow my own dark green dress to fit the part for the night. As\
  \ I walk in tiny steps, the long traje de gitana swishes around my ankles and tightly\
  \ pulls on my shoulders. (I\u2019m most impressed by the ingenuity of the hidden\
  \ pocket under my ruffles, so I don\u2019t need to carry a purse \u2014 a truly\
  \ liberating experience). On top of my head sits a proud red flower, with my curls\
  \ tied back into a loose knot, in true Sevillana style. \n\nWe enter into the caseta\
  \ and are instantly handed two sherry wine glasses filled with manzanilla and a\
  \ splash of Sprite. The drink combination called rebujito is just as sweet and deadly\
  \ as you\u2019d imagine. Already, the band is playing and people are clapping their\
  \ hands and singing along to the traditional anthem. It\u2019s only 4pm, yet the\
  \ party has been in full swing since lunch time, and will continue on until the\
  \ early hours of the morning. \n\nIt only takes a few minutes observing the inside\
  \ of this caseta to feel the passion the people of Seville feel, for not only their\
  \ country, but their city. They sing songs referencing the river that runs through\
  \ the center of the city and the orange trees that line their streets. The pride\
  \ exudes from every human, old and young, dressed in their finest, singing and toasting\
  \ to health during this special week-long celebration.   \n\nFinally a favorite\
  \ tune that everyone has been waiting for begins, and people move towards the dance\
  \ floor at once. As the band starts to play, a hand reaches out to me. I shake my\
  \ head to decline the offer from my friend. The weight of my traje de gitana feels\
  \ heavy on my shoulders.\n\nThe Sevillana dance is one that I have witnessed a few\
  \ times before, but never truly learned.  It  embodies the spirit of this city.\n\
  \nMarina does not accept my refusal. With a sounding \u2018vamos, guapa\u2019, we\
  \ leapt onto the dance floor together.  As my dance partner, she directed me where\
  \ to step and when to spin. The people around me were performing the same routine\
  \ in sync, yet no one was particularly bothered when I misstepped. Each pair was\
  \ too focused on their own perfect routine to notice my blunders. \n\nFor a short\
  \ moment during the dance, I am part of an old world tradition, much older than\
  \ any tradition in my own home country, completely consumed by the music, spinning\
  \ colors and Andalusian spirit."
