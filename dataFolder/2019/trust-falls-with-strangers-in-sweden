Text: "\u201CMy boyfriend may be here too - he was supposed to take our puppy to his\
  \ parents for the weekend, but decided not to go. Is that okay?\u201D\n\nI thought\
  \ for only a second - as one does when talking to a friend of nearly ten years they\u2019\
  ve never met - before confidently typing back, \u201COKAY!\u201D with a cheerful\
  \ smiley face. \n\nA few moments went by before I received a reply.\n\n\u201Corz...He\
  \ says that his brother might come over too. Is that alright?\u201D\n\nThis was\
  \ a critical thinking moment: in addition to one woman that I\u2019ve called my\
  \ friend since I was thirteen but have only ever spoken to online, there will now\
  \ be two men I\u2019ve never met joining us. She mentioned not wanting to make me\
  \ uncomfortable by having her boyfriend around before - but now his his brother\
  \ will be there too. \n\nI quickly reassured myself that this was, perhaps, for\
  \ her own safety as well and I reasserted my compliance once again, \u201CThat\u2019\
  s fine!\u201D\n\nConversely, my mother has taught me to be suspicious of most things,\
  \ and while I certainly hadn\u2019t taken that advice before, this seemed like the\
  \ appropriate time to think twice. I was only generally aware of where I would be\
  \ visiting in Sweden: Goteborg, a city not too far from the country\u2019s western\
  \ coast, bordering a water mass shared with Norway and Denmark. \n\nBut, the specifics\
  \ were not clear. I trusted this friend - about seven years my senior - to provide\
  \ me with lodging, transportation, and everything else, as she had offered. I did\
  \ NOT ask any preliminary questions. \n\nI had refused to ask those questions because\
  \ I did not want to appear suspicious of someone I\u2019d been comfortable enough\
  \ to call my friend for so long and have behaved accordingly: telling stories, sharing\
  \ secrets, and everything else that friends do but in a close proximity to one another.\
  \ \n\nMy mother, however, was up for the challenge of inquiry - and she expected\
  \ me to answer all of her questions. Because of this, I was met with an earful of\
  \ her concerned scolding and was accused of dishonesty when I told her I was unsure\
  \ of where exactly I would be. This made me more anxious than before. I slept peacefully\
  \ during the plane ride but there was an undercurrent of tension dwelling within.\
  \ \n\nOnce my RyanAir flight landed, I figured my fate was sealed. I had already\
  \ purchased the tickets, taken the flight, and arrived in Sweden. If anything life-threatening\
  \ was to occur, there would be no turning back now. Regardless of my potential peril,\
  \ I had done well up to this point. I had visited Cuba for a week, Greece for three\
  \ days, and had lived in London for the past two months - all before my 21st birthday.\
  \ I had a good run.\n\nI made my way through baggage claim with devout focus on\
  \ positive thoughts. The airport was movie-set pristine and fairly vacant. Those\
  \ who were there dispersed quickly. I followed suit.\n\nAs I stepped through the\
  \ automatic doors with my duffle bag and backpack, I saw her. She was alone and\
  \ shorter than I had expected. Her boyfriend, Simon, and his brother, Matthias,\
  \ were still at home. This was quite disarming and immediately reduced the anxiety\
  \ I ignored during the flight. \n\nWe hugged and spoke bashfully about how great\
  \ it was to finally meet in person. Any remaining doubt began to dissipate. She\
  \ explained again that her home was quite a ways away from the airport and we needed\
  \ take two buses to get there.\n\nMy mother contacted me after we boarded bus #1,\
  \ essentially requesting exact coordinates. I must have looked vexed because she\
  \ asked what was wrong, prompting me to explain my mother\u2019s weariness. \n\n\
  She was understanding and reiterated in greater detail where exactly I would be\
  \ staying with her. I relayed this to my mother, and she was pacified but promised\
  \ to be in touch again. \n\nTwo bus rides later, we arrived at her house as guaranteed.\
  \ Simon and Matthias were waiting there with their puppy and her cat. They greeted\
  \ me warmly with drinks and Simon even took the time to prepare food. I was safe!"
