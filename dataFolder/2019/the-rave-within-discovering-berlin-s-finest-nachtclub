Text: "I never thought I would find myself in the dark and humid tile-lined corners\
  \ of a former Berlin club toilet turned avant-garde techno altar. Much like my own\
  \ form of toilet diving epiphany, I delved into OHM, a small but potent venue, once\
  \ appendage now organ in its own biological right; known across town for its thoughtful\
  \ bookings and fortuitous queer atmosphere.\n\nIt was the gelid mistral wind that\
  \ had made the possibility of refuge all the more enticing. It was a typical Monday\
  \ after-party morning, and my status as newcomer towny rendered the experience,\
  \ of being led through what seemed like unexplored pathways to a rarely encountered\
  \ urban oasis, both an adventure and a slight emotional ordeal. After all, no-one\
  \ wishes to be led into their own salvation.\n\nIf art imitates life, then I'm not\
  \ sure on what side of the spectrum OHM lies. An elusive mixture of the mundane\
  \ and the holy clashed at the site of what remains to be my favorite Berlin club.\
  \ Small, almost quaint and functional in its spatial distribution, rumor has it\
  \ OHM operated as a little-used 'powder' room that eventually morphed into the too-cool-for-school\
  \ baby sister of one historical scene giant, Derrick May's original Berlin home:\
  \ Tresor. \n\nOHM's fixture will casually include accomplished female and gender\
  \ variant artists like Crusat and Lolsnake that are probably closer to being neurosurgeons\
  \ than musicians. If nothing else, their craft serves a teeming chalice of the sublime;\
  \ a cornucopia of sophisticated computer generated sounds entrenched with the primal\
  \ spirit that layers the very origin of music.\n\nThe ordinary cement floor that\
  \ dubs in for a dance floor has been my own personal milky way into the depths of\
  \ an unclaimed musical territory, dormant within me. To say that, in such space,\
  \ I found a part of me I never knew I was missing would definitely be an understatement.\
  \ OHM has been the Chapel at which I have communed with the religious nature of\
  \ techno dancing. For all its echo-chamber liminality, the guttural finds sweet\
  \ comfort in the womb of this defiant non-place, bespoke in the fashion of the great\
  \ houses of noise that have weaved the fabric of Berlin's primary nature: techno\
  \ culture.\n\nEmbedded in the heart muscle of the city's 'foulest' pass times (a.k.a\
  \ surrounded by sex clubs like The Kit Kat Club and techno mecca Berghain), Friedrischain's\
  \ OHM has been saving lives from meaningless derision for almost 5 years now. Opened\
  \ in 2014, the club\u2019s rule of thumb has been to strive for diversity outside\
  \ of the sometimes rigid confinements of canonical techno forms by outlining an\
  \ artillery of warily curated act units- impervious to the ills of homogeneity and\
  \ lack of diversity. In all, OHM nachtblub\u2019s goal has been to create an equal\
  \ opportunity sanctuary of that which moves us and isn't necessarily the cookie-cutter-mold\
  \ of the institutional orthodoxy set by other, much larger, venues. \n\nChirpy house,\
  \ rampaging noise, moody techno, and the sui generis always find room in OHM's ever-expanding\
  \ protocol against behavioral expectations. 'What I like is the diversity of the\
  \ programming', confided Andreas Richter, also by the name of one DJ Reznik, to\
  \ the Guardian back in the summer of 2016; two years after OHM's auspicious entry\
  \ into the list of Berlin's most sought after nightlife experiences. \n\nUpon my\
  \ own baptismal arrival nearly a year and a half ago, hedonism surely ensued but\
  \ only as a secondary moving force. Whatever is the standardized hierarchy set by\
  \ Berlin's almost mythical reputation for debauchery, it was immediately unpacked\
  \ and deprogrammed. \n\nAnd, iterations notwithstanding, that moment, the very night\
  \ that witnessed my expulsion out of the warmly decorated interiors of the familiar,\
  \ and into my distinctly personal noise jungle, remains seared in my recollection\
  \ and unparalleled in its life altering significance. I wish my tour guide friend\
  \ could have joined the rave within."
