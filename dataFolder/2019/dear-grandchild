Text: "Before you read this \nPlease Put on your headphone and play some slow instrumental\
  \ music on youtube. (Alright stay with me) \nImagine its 2079 and you are 83 years\
  \ old. \n*WHAT KIND OF STORIES WILL YOU TELL YOUR GRANDCHILDREN?*\nStories like\
  \ how you were 21 years old, graduated from university with the best paying job...\
  \ made a million by 30... which color was your first car... worked day and night\
  \ till you were 59 and got retired by 60. \n\nWell... \nThis is how my story will\
  \ look like (or any traveler or a nomad's story) \nI was a 21yr old who just graduated...\
  \ I had three choices in front of me \n1. Take up Masters \n2. Take a Job or \n\
  3. Start working with Dad\n\nI did something which no one in my community did. \n\
  I packed a bag and went to Varanasi, India. \nThere I met 7 people from 6 different\
  \ countries... Spent 5 days together and did shadow dance in an unknown street after\
  \ drinking the famous shake with weed in it. (P.S:- I didn't drink cause I don't\
  \ smoke, Drink or do drugs) \nTook a dip in the holy water of Ganga and unfortunately,\
  \ I didn't know how to swim and the flow was so hard that it took me in and I started\
  \ drowning... 30 people from my country were watching me drown for 40seconds and\
  \ suddenly this one Irish friend of mine jumped in to save me (Thank god that his\
  \ dad was lifeguard for 30years and taught his son few things too) \nAfter Varanasi,\
  \ I understood the Importance of backpacking and took the biggest decision of my\
  \ life. \nTraveling to a different country alone. \nFrom Varanasi... Nepal's Border\
  \ was just 250kms away \nI took a bus and on the way, I picked up a Korean who taught\
  \ me Korean Numbers and How to say Hi in Korean Langauge. \nI Spent 12 days in Nepal\
  \ with just 16$... How did I do that... I Couchsurfed and my hosts gave me food\
  \ and also showed me around.\nI took a bus in Nepal for 13hours from Tansem to Pokhara\
  \ which was 130kms only. \nI saw the best views of my life and also I puked twice.\
  \ \nI didn't have Internet, I had a one side working earphone and a good book but\
  \ the bus was too hacky to read. \nIn Pokhara, I did something which I never did\
  \ before... I went to the most famous park and I was journaling and suddenly I got\
  \ an Idea. \nI wrote Free Conversations and Hugs on my dairy in huge letters and\
  \ kept it behind me... The Next three hours were so beautiful.. So many conversations..\
  \ lots of hugs.. I can guarantee you one thing... No money in this whole world can\
  \ give me that Experience and Emotions ever. \nIn Pokhara, I also met a few travelers\
  \ with whom I spent a good time in Varanasi too. \nEvery time I met someone whom\
  \ I met before in a different city... I kept saying them \n\"ITS A SMALL WORLD FAM\"\
  \n\nI kept traveling and kept creating more stories every single day... it kept\
  \ my mental health stable and more time to understand myself. \nNow I know what\
  \ do I want in my life. \nI want to share Good Stories with my Grandchildren...\
  \ (That's my 83year old goal) \nSo...\n*WHAT KIND OF STORIES WILL YOU TELL YOUR\
  \ GRANDCHILDREN?*\n\nMuch Love, \nPrado."
