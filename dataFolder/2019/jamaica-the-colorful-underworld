Text: "The array of flowers that lay welcomed outside of my window pane each day excited\
  \ me to know that I was in a new world. Jamaica, the succulent savory scents roamed\
  \ the land with jerk seasoning and destinct spices filled my weary soul. I knew\
  \ I was no longer back home in the land of America. The people spoke softly in their\
  \ homeland dialect which sounded like a jazzy beat from a steel drum band that marched\
  \ down the street. Each day I would wake up and walk to the window. I would open\
  \ the shutters and let in the beautiful ray of sunlight. The warmth of the sun kissed\
  \ my forehead so gently. I watched the clear blue water crash up against the rocks\
  \ that stacked up against the bay. The sand was clear and not a sight of person\
  \ was near. I stood still for several minutes to take in all of this beauty that\
  \ the island of Montego Bay Jamaica had to offer. As I started to plan out my day,\
  \ I carefully picked clothing that was going to accentuate the warm of the sun.\
  \ I wore a brightly colorful top and loose lifting pants. My open-toed sandals gave\
  \ plenty of room for my toes to feel the earth move under my feet. I was in awe.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t believe that this experience was happening to me. I went to the\
  \ nearest restaurant to grab me a bite to eat. The jerk chicken and curry chicken\
  \ was overcoming my tastebuds so that\u2019s what my soul called for me to eat.\
  \ I had peas and rice, a leafy and colorful salad, and sweet plaintains; the island\u2019\
  s fruit. I thought I was in heaven. I also had a sweet strawberry and nectar fruit\
  \ drink that made everything complete. As the day went by I was highly entrenched\
  \ in the arts and the culture of the land. I visited churches that had old-fashioned\
  \ organs that played beautiful angelic music. I attend an elementary school with\
  \ youth who worn uniform and took pride in learning the lessons of the day. Everyone\
  \ was welcoming and excited for me to come and visit. The school was a small worn\
  \ down building but they did their best to educate their students. The teachers\
  \ were dedicated to the teaching styles for the youth. The children spoke about\
  \ their travels to the school and how the roads were very bad but they loved school\
  \ so they came everyday to receive their lesson. Some of the children had younger\
  \ siblings that they had to also bring to school. They talked about the love of\
  \ their parents and how they helped prepare meals, laundry, and cleaning up of the\
  \ yard and their house daily. I truly enjoyed the stories that they shared. It felt\
  \ like a true sense of community building that the youth were experiencing at such\
  \ a young age. I believe that they were also very wise about how they shared about\
  \ valuing time, respecting their elders, and loving their culture. At night I went\
  \ to see a live band perform. The reggae tunes were amazing. The sound from the\
  \ saxophone melted my heart. The gyrating and swaying of the dance moves was great\
  \ fun. I truly enjoyed my time in Jamaica. Each day was amazing and worth the trip.\
  \ I would advise everyone to go to Jamaica atleast once in their lifetime. It\u2019\
  s definitely an experience that no one should ever miss. From the scenery, to the\
  \ music, to the food, to the people, the youth, their culture, and the overall experience\
  \ was definitely fulfilling to me. I would love to go back again to visit. Definitely\
  \ a lasting memory that would forever stay apart of my heart."
