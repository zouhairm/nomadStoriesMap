Text: "It is our third day on the road. El Camino winds along quiet forest trails,\
  \ through the backyards of tiny villages and centers of ciudades; it merges into\
  \ large motorways - just to slip back into the wilderness again. We pass old churches,\
  \ springs, stone bridges; each comes with a neat plate with a yellow shell and its\
  \ name: such-and-such ponte, such-and-such fuente and so on. \n\nAs we rest for\
  \ a bit in the shadow of another church, Elena recalls the rosary she lost yesterday.\
  \ I come up with a comforting thought: maybe a very good person will find it? It\
  \ sounds like a good enough solace to her.\n\n***\nIt's well past noon, and we are\
  \ walking along the side of the highway. Huge white windmills looms above us on\
  \ a mountain ridge. Elena stops to take a photo. She catches up with me a few minutes\
  \ later, smiling and panting.\n\n\u2014 We are being followed - by a man in a red\
  \ parka! And it's not Pedro - unless he to managed to grow a beard since last morning.\n\
  \nI turn back and see far below a stranger pilgrim in a straw hat, leaning on a\
  \ bamboo staff. The walk is steep, so we continue on our way - and the climb completely\
  \ absorbs our attention.\n\nAt the top, somewhere at the outskirts of Bodenaya,\
  \ I take off my backpack and sit down at a shabby, vandalized bus stop to wait for\
  \ mt friend. She is not the first one to catch up with me though. The \"red parka\
  \ man\" is, who turns out to be a nice young Spanish guy by the name of Paco. \n\
  \n***\nWe all unpack in the dorm on the second floor of the albergue, which looks\
  \ like a room in an international student summer camp: coloured flags, photos, pictures\
  \ on the walls. Bunk beds - so familiar to me already - stand along walls. There\
  \ is a poster above Elena's bed, or rather a page cut out of a magazine: a seascape\
  \ with a poem by Gregor Attlin:\n\nGoin ever westward\ntowards his immersion\nAfter\
  \ passing through the seas\nOvercoming death,\nThe rising sun witnesses\nThe new\
  \ life.\n\n***\nIt's almost dinner time, so we go down to the living room. The fireplace\
  \ bursts with heat, adding comfort to the already pleasant atmosphere. Books and\
  \ albums fill the shelves, and the walls are full of paintings and faded portraits\
  \ of pilgrims of bygone days. The long wooden table, lined with heavy benches, fills\
  \ the best part of the hall. We sit at the bar counter, chatting and examining a\
  \ bunch of memorabilia that is hanging from the beams: key chains, flags, shells\
  \ and rosaries. Once again, Elena recalls her loss out loud.\n\n\u2014 A rosary?\
  \ I found a rosary yesterday. Maybe it was yours? \u2014 asks Paco.\n\u2014 Was\
  \ it green??? \u2014 Elena runs away after the spaniard, to carry out the identification.\
  \ And yes, of course, it is her rosary. Looks like I hit it with my guess about\
  \ the \"good person\".\n\n***\nOur hospitalero Alejandro serves a hearty dinner.\
  \ It is a thick soup and a fruit-and-veggie salad with colored fuzilli - not the\
  \ kind of food I am used to, but very tasty and nourishing. We very quickly fill\
  \ ourselves up to the state when all you want is sit and talk. Alejandro quickly\
  \ cleans up the table, then bends over us and asks:\n\n\u2014 Yo good?\n\u2014 Yes,\
  \ yes, we are good, \u2014 we answer, full and happy to the brim.\n\nIn less than\
  \ a minute, he brings each of us a small cup of strawberry yo-gut.\n\n***\nIn the\
  \ morning, at the door of the albergue, Alexandro hugs everyone goodbye, takes some\
  \ photos of us on his mobile phone and wishes us Buen Camino. Elena returns the\
  \ debt to the unfathomable fate - she hands Paco her rosary so he can give it back\
  \ to her when they meet again. We leave the hospitable house behind; Bodenaya becomes\
  \ another bead on the string of our Path."
