Text: "A room full of blue eyes stared at me inquisitively. My eyes fluttered, afraid\
  \ to maintain contact; I felt as if I had travelled between worlds and was now an\
  \ invader in someone else\u2019s realm. Truth be told, I was. I was 21 years old,\
  \ and had been invited to spend the Christmas holidays with my friend Line\u2019\
  s family in Oslo, Norway. It was a warm gesture in the coldest season of the year,\
  \ since I was going to be away from my own family in Canada for the holidays.\n\t\
  Suddenly, I was entangled in the warm embrace of strangers. Smiles emerged amongst\
  \ the cool expressions and I was ushered into the wooden house. I walked into a\
  \ cozy living room, where we all assembled around a wooden table. Her mother, aunt,\
  \ uncle and cousins began asking me questions about who I was, what did my parents\
  \ do, how I enjoyed my studies back in the Netherlands, and so on. I also learned\
  \ about her aunt\u2019s and uncle\u2019s professions. I learned that Line\u2019\
  s uncle was an author. I didn\u2019t press for specific details from him, but some\
  \ months later when I mentioned his name, Jo Nesb\xF8, to a friend, I was stunned\
  \ to find out that he was a world re-known author whose books had even been made\
  \ into movies.\n\tLater that evening, we all gathered around the table for dinner.\
  \ I was enthused to hear the mixture of Swedish, Norwegian and English being spoken\
  \ around me. When the conversation entered serious topics about political issues,\
  \ her family members naturally defaulted into Norwegian unconsciously. I didn\u2019\
  t mind in the slightest as I was a guest in their home, but I was intrigued to know\
  \ what they were speaking about. Quietly, a voice whispered to me in English from\
  \ my left. I glanced over to Line\u2019s brother in law leaning into me. His deep\
  \ blue eyes watched the speakers intently as he translated each statement. A small\
  \ smile tugged at the corners of my lips and I listened as they discussed how the\
  \ Swedish government was dealing with their wolf populations.\n\tAfter a hearty\
  \ meal of sausage, red pickled cabbage, breads and traditional desserts, it was\
  \ time to open gifts. It was getting late, as it is tradition to open gifts on the\
  \ night of the 24th instead of the morning of the 25th. In North America, it is\
  \ normal to spend hundreds of dollars on gifts, and the success of Christmas is\
  \ measured by how many gifts one receives. I was dumbfounded to see the contrast\
  \ in gift exchange \u2013 Line\u2019s family exchanged gifts of a different value\
  \ \u2013 calendars with personal pictures, hand-knit clothing pieces, equipment\
  \ that was exclusively for a hobby or work.\nTo my surprise, gifts were placed in\
  \ my hands. I was not expecting anything from Line\u2019s family and felt somewhat\
  \ ashamed that I had not brought anything to reciprocate. When I saw a bundle of\
  \ alpaca yarn and plain slippers, my heart instantly felt warm. These simple gifts\
  \ felt monumental because I realized that they had been chosen especially for me,\
  \ and who I was as a person had been taken into consideration. Knitting is a popular\
  \ skill to know in Norway, and since Line had been teaching me, her mom decided\
  \ to give me good quality yarn to begin my learning process. Line\u2019s brother\
  \ in law ran a middle-age themed market, and gave me a pair of Viking-style slippers\
  \ because he knew of my keen interest in history.\n       I learned many things\
  \ when I was 21, but the most important lesson was on the power of human connection.\
  \ When I spent Christmas in Oslo, I harvested the value in absorbing cultural phenomenon\
  \ directly from the source and it deepened my appreciation for differences amongst\
  \ groups of people. I even adapted some of their practices because I found them\
  \ to be more 'me' than what I had grown up being told was 'best'. And thus, I discovered\
  \ that I was able to find a little slice of home in a group of strangers."
