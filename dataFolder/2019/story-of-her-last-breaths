Text: "This was my first flight, before that the flights used to fly overhead in the\
  \ sky. I was not happy but, As I travelling with the ashes of my love one who used\
  \ to listen to me,say me stories of all kind my grandmom. Packing my bags with her\
  \ for the last time this was a lone trip where I traveled  from Guwahati to Delhi\
  \ flying with thoughts of her in my head. As I reached Delhi and the doors of flight\
  \ opened a humongus heat rushed to my body it was the summer of July. I decided\
  \ to leave for Haridwar as soon as I reached Delhi. While I was enquiring the taxi\
  \ station near airport I met a fine dressed lady standing near by with elegancy\
  \ and grace . I first whispered silently could you please help and I turned my self\
  \ as I felt little awkward to talk to a stranger to help me out but to my utter\
  \ surprise she came to me, forwarding her hands to shake hands and made me comfortable\
  \ and asked me how could I help you,I said I am new in Delhi I don't know the taxi\
  \ station, she asked further where do you want to go I told her Haridwar.  She further\
  \ enquired whether do I have any specific purpose for the visit after that my face\
  \ got dull and she understood looking at my sad face that I was travelling for settling\
  \ loved ones ashes into water, and I didn't have to speak anymore,  She showed me\
  \ the taxi station and had a talk with the taxi driver and gave me a good deal for\
  \ the taxi from Delhi to Haridwar. As I was about to leave I said her thanks and\
  \ asked her where she was going as she was carrying huge luggage with her. She remarked\
  \ she was also finding a taxi to Haridwar I was so happy with her kind approach\
  \ that she founded one for me first I told her to come inside the taxi if she was\
  \ comfortable travelling with a stranger, she smiled and sat in the backseat of\
  \ the car.  While traveling she was explaining me all the destinations like meerut,\
  \ rishikesh till we reached Haridwar . We didnt exchange numbers but aiyna was a\
  \ good companion in the  whole travel session from Delhi.Now I found a hotel for\
  \ me to stay. And the next day was for me, to say bye to my love grandma. I cudnt\
  \ sleep that  night . I got a call from the priest that he was at the banks of gangas\
  \ at 5:00 am and the soothing touch of fresh air at morning made me feel lighter\
  \ and blessed to be there. The water was cold and was a prime time to take a holy\
  \ dip in holy gangas as I took my last dip of three . This time the priest told\
  \ me to take dip with the ashes and with my unseen rolling tears by granny ashes\
  \ floated in water.  After completing all rituals of last good bye of our tradition\
  \ I was in a good mood to travel In Haridwar and rishikesh. Haridwar had big temples\
  \ and rishikesh had a good surrounding of greenery everywhere. I loved the people\
  \ travelling there as they were fun loving and while visiting any temple they were\
  \ singing and dancing to the temple.  The road side dhaba's food were delicious\
  \ and mouth watery without being to expensive.  The experience of my first travel\
  \ on fight had a sad and a happy touch both, meeting new people had a good impression\
  \ on my mind which made me recover from sadness of my granny not being with me.\
  \ \nThis was more a pilgrim trip where I got to see the beauty of the mountains\
  \ and rivers the shoothing air and beautiful people with kind and gracefull heart\
  \ around. \nMy first flight trip ended well and I was happy with my first trip.\n\
  Haridwar taught me we always should be loving and caring as we all leave one day\
  \ to almighty."
