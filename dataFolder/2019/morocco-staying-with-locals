Text: "It\u2019s our first time in the African continent. A trip to Africa wasn\u2019\
  t in our original plans. Our idea was to spend two months traveling around western\
  \ Europe, but one day, while we were reading a blog, we asked ourselves, what if\
  \ we go to Morocco? And so we bought our tickets.\nWe arrived at Marrakesh airport\
  \ at night, our flight was delayed and we arrived to find an endless line to pass\
  \ through customs. When we finally made it through customs, we met our couchsurfing\
  \ host, who was worried, but welcomed us with a big smile. He had been waiting us\
  \ for two hours.\nMeeting Hamza was like seeing an old friend. He explained us what\
  \ to do next: Go through the parking lot without paying attention to all the transfer\
  \ offers, wait for him next to the main road where he will meet us to stop a taxi\
  \ and explain the driver where he should take us. He would follow us on his motorcycle.\
  \ We jump in to the taxi, Hamza shared the address with the taxi driver in Arabic\
  \ and we set off. Everything had happened quickly, and suddenly we were in Morocco\
  \ in a taxi without really knowing where we were going.\nWhen we arrived, the taxi\
  \ driver gestured for us to get out of the car. The neighborhood was dark and quiet.\
  \ He didn\u2019t seem to be leaving us at the door of any house, and there were\
  \ no signs of Hamza. I decide to ask the taxi driver in French what had Hamza told\
  \ him. He explained me that he will meet us there and that we didn't have to be\
  \ worried as we were in a safe place. \nEvery time I travel to a new place I tried\
  \ to adapt to the culture, follow their dress code to go as unnoticed as possible.\
  \ However, when you have just arrived and you are carrying the backpack, it is simply\
  \ impossible to blend in with the environment. \nAfter a few minutes waiting on\
  \ the corner we saw Hamza\u2019s bike coming. We walked together to his house. We\
  \ follow Hamza up a long and narrow staircase, and as in every Moroccan house, we\
  \ take off our shoes before entering. We enter to the room where we would sleep\
  \ to leave our backpacks. It was a room covered with carpets with two L shaped armchairs,\
  \ our bed, and a wide window dressed with large patterned and colorful velvet curtains.\n\
  Couchsurfing in Africa was not like any of our previous experiences. Hamza lived\
  \ with his parents with whom we shared four days. We shared dinner, we ate tajine\
  \ (a Moroccan typical food) with our hands, we communicated through signs and smiles,\
  \ we watched arabic television, we cooked empanadas for them, we heard them praying,\
  \ we told them about our culture and we asked about theirs.\nOur neighborhood was\
  \ outside the medina. During the day we walked around, we went with Hamza to go\
  \ shopping which peaked the curiosity of the locals. They wanted to know everything\
  \ about us: where we were from, what we were doing there, and for how long we were\
  \ staying. The reception and hospitality that we felt in Morocco does not compare\
  \ with that felt anywhere else we have ever been. At the same time, the culture\
  \ shock is one of the biggest that I have ever experienced. Everything was new.\
  \ The mosque, its people, the smell of the spices that intermingle in the air while\
  \ walking on the street, its infinite variety of olives, the call to the mosque\
  \ at the time of prayer, the cats, the shops with all kinds of crafts hanging, the\
  \ tanneries, his clothes, the mint tea, the tajine. \nTraveling is a way to break\
  \ down prejudices, demystify beliefs, immerse oneself in a culture that is alien,\
  \ learn and respect diversity. It is a way to identify our similarities despite\
  \ our differences. It is, without a doubt, to grow."
