Text: "It was the third night at our campsite in Fraser Island. The place seemed taken\
  \ out of a Star Wars movie. Naturally, it\u2019s hard to stop asking yourself if\
  \ you are is still on planet earth, when you\u2019re standing on the largest sand\
  \ island in the world. It\u2019s a place so magnificent that all you can do is feel\
  \ at awe for having the opportunity of being on that land. \n\nI was laying on the\
  \ roof of our 4X4, where I decided was the safest place and the furthest away from\
  \ the immense spider I had just encountered inside our tent. It is no joke why Australia\
  \ is famous for its arachnids, they\u2019re actually huge. \n\nAs I tried to calm\
  \ down and convince myself that the spider hadn\u2019t followed me all the way to\
  \ the van, I heard a noice down by the beach, where the camp guide had deliberately\
  \ prohibited us to go too late at night. I hoped that whatever it was, would return\
  \ back to camp soon \u2014 unless it was one of those coyote type dogs known as\
  \ dingos that rounded by the shore. As you can imagine, I was a little frightened\
  \ by the fauna at Aussieland. \n\nNonetheless, it was the last night of our trip,\
  \ and I was determined to spend the night under the stars, watching the stellar\
  \ show the night sky offered, almost as a theatrical spectacle. You could spot a\
  \ shooting star every ten seconds and point out every single galaxy and planet with\
  \ no effort. \nI had brought my sleeping bag with me and was succumbing to the deliciousness\
  \ of double coated Tim Tams, preparing for the show, when suddenly, I heard the\
  \ noice down by the beach again. I was starting to worry that it may actually be\
  \ a dingo and started second guessing my decision of running away from the spider,\
  \ when suddenly, I heard someone scream \u201CSHOOTING STAR\u201D\n\nI figured the\
  \ noice I\u2019ve heard down by the beach was from someone of our camp, trying,\
  \ as I was, to get away from the party at the main camp to enjoy the magnificence\
  \ of the night sky.  \u201CA companion for the show,\u201D I thought. It took me\
  \ no time to spot the second shooting star and decided to answer back \u201CMAKE\
  \ A WISH\u201D I screamed, with all the air in my lungs.\n\nWe spent the next hour\
  \ or so screaming back to each other \u201CSHOOTING STAR\u201D, \u201CMAKE A WISH\u201D\
  , \u201CSHOOTING STAR\u201D, \u201CMAKE A WISH\u201D. The show seemed never ending\
  \ and gave me a sense of peace I\u2019ve never experienced before. As if looking\
  \ at the stars had all the answers in the world and at the same time, turned all\
  \ the problems I thought so relevant, so small, so insignificant. \n\nAfter a thousand\
  \ or so \u201CSHOOTING STAR\u201D we stopped screaming and settled to admire the\
  \ show. Some other people from camp came down to join us too, and the roof of the\
  \ van started looking like a movie theater, with people bringing snacks and sleeping\
  \ bags to admire the sky. The atmosphere was of complete admiration and respect\
  \ for what we were all experiencing, and somehow, made me feel a special connection\
  \ with everyone there.\nThe night started getting colder and quieter. Some people\
  \ started falling asleep and others decided to return back to their tents. Nonetheless,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t ready to leave yet. I kept pointing out galaxies \u201CAndromeda\u201D\
  , \u201CCentaurus\u201D, \u201CMessier\u201D. Trying to memorize the moment as hard\
  \ as I could, promising myself I would never forget what I was watching. What happened\
  \ after, assured me I wouldn\u2019t. \n\nA huge red fire ball, or at least that\u2019\
  s what I thought, suddenly appeared at the night sky, crossing at an inmensurable\
  \ speed what seemed as the entire universe. I couldn\u2019t help but scream at the\
  \ thought of being smashed by a meteorite or whatever the UFO was. My friend at\
  \ the beach couldn\u2019t either. And suddenly, it was just the two of us again,\
  \ fearing for our lives in the most inimaginable circumstances. \u201CARE YOU OK?\u201D\
  \ My old friend asked \u201CI  GUESS THAT WAS MY WISH COME TRUE\u201D I answered."
