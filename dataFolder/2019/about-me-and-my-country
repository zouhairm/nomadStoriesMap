Text: "Hi, my name is Nazik and I study at a high school. I live in the beautiful\
  \ country of Kyrgyzstan. As for me, my homeland is the most beautiful and favorable\
  \ place for living. Kyrgyzstan is a small, breathtaking country, trapped between\
  \ mountains. Our land is rich with historical, cultural and natural attractions.\
  \ Mountains of all shades, the mysterious lake Issyk-Kul, medieval fortresses -\
  \ this is what our country can boast of. I have never been abroad, which is why\
  \ it is the most beautiful places for me that I have ever seen. Our country was\
  \ part of  the USSR. We honor our past and carefully save national traditions. \n\
  More than once I traveled to other cities and regions as a participant in a competition\
  \ or a movement. Personally, my country was especially fond of when the World Nomad\
  \ Games were held. If you do not know what it is, then be sure to find out about\
  \ it. We, the Kyrgyz, have long been a nomadic people who constantly moved from\
  \ pasture to pasture. Our ancestors in the summer rose to the high meadows, and\
  \ wintered in the valleys. Today there are a lot of people who want to visit various\
  \ ethnic festivals, but all the cultural wealth can be seen only at the World Nomad\
  \ Games.\nI visited this festival in 2014 with a band. There I got acquainted with\
  \ the traditions of many countries, such as: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, China,\
  \ Russia, Turkey, USA, etc.\nAt the games there are not only wrestling competitions,\
  \ but also intellectual games, horse racing, hunt igashi national games Kok-Boru\
  \ and Er Enshi. I write about this festival because I want to attract people who\
  \ are interested in the stories and amazing customs of the peoples of all tribes.\
  \ I also visited the wonderful lake Issyk-Kul. This lake, as I learned, never freezes,\
  \ due to the great depth, well, except in some banks. Therefore, Issyk-Kul in Kyrgyz\
  \ means \"Hot Lake\". When I was there, I got up before the sun, came to the shore\
  \ and watched the dawn. It was wonderful to see the sun rise from the mountains,\
  \ leaving them behind. If you think about it, I visited many places in my country.\
  \ I made sure that in different regions they honor their traditions and customs,\
  \ even if in some ways we are different, we always remain friendly and attentive\
  \ to guests.\nI hope I have interested readers with my story about my country. Morover,\
  \ we always welcome guests, although you will see for yourself. Now I want to expand\
  \ my vision of this world.\nThere are so many interesting places, sights and cultures\
  \ in the world that you want to travel and write about them as soon as possible.\
  \ I am sure that in the future I will not give up this occupation, but on the contrary\
  \ I will make it broader and more interesting. I think it\u2019s boring and not\
  \ interesting to visit countries alone, it\u2019s better to share your impressions,\
  \ learn new things and discover the unknown with like-minded people. In the future,\
  \ I want to travel with people who also love this occupation. I would really like\
  \ to see other countries, change my world view and share my impressions."
