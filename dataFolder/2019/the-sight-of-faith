Text: "Ribbons were tied at the height of the feet of the saint, carrying hopes, memories\
  \ and wishes. Shaking and swinging at the rhythm of the wind, the ribbons carry,\
  \ beyond its color, the pray for a hoped wish. The popular belief guarantees that\
  \ if you\u2019re able to unlace the ribbon\u2019s knots, the ties of your life will\
  \ be untied too. I never thought that I would find, in a roadtrip with my family,\
  \ a land raised in faith.\n\nThis first impression caught me in the eyes after I\
  \ climbed the stairs, reaching the feet of the statue of Padre C\xEDcero. One day\
  \ ago, I got into the road with my parents destined to Sergipe, but we decided to\
  \ make a quick stop of two days at Juazeiro do Norte, to visit my grandfather and\
  \ know the city. At the next day after our arrival, in the first sunlight of the\
  \ morning, my grandfather woke us up to take us right up the road that leads to\
  \ the Horto, a spiritual complex constructed in the city in tribute to Padre C\xED\
  cero, a charismatic religious old leader who influenced  social, political and religiously\
  \ the story Cear\xE1\u2019s backwoods. \n\nThe road drove us to the Horto, which\
  \ is constituted by a statue of the priest, a museum and a church in construction,\
  \ and carries with it an atmosphere of faith inlayed in every single corner of the\
  \ place. The statue of the saint, in white concrete, lays in the higher point of\
  \ the city, observing the life of the dwellers and blessing the lifes and the hearts\
  \ of the thousands of pilgrims that come four times a year to the spiritual celebrations.\
  \ It\u2019s possible to see and taste the faith in the air, at the tired sight of\
  \  a woman that climbs the stairs to reach the statue, at the symbols of saints\
  \ in the religious souvenirs, at the resigned and peaceful silence of the ones who\
  \ pray for a miracle. \n\nRight next to the statue, a memorial sealed the decades\
  \ of wishes and prays requested do the priest. I got in the space constructed in\
  \ a blue building with a colonial design architecture and, at first sight, I tasted\
  \ in the air the flavour of wood. At the walls, the story of the excommunicated\
  \ and forgived priest made an excellent composition with the stories of the thousands\
  \ of  persons that had blessings achieveds, represented for the \u201Cex-votes\u201D\
  , little replicas of wood which typifyed the benedictions. Maybe, if blessings have\
  \ smell, they smell like wood. \n\nBe in the Horto was try on be at the beginning\
  \ and at the end of something at exactly the same time. The place is a complex web\
  \ of stories of thousands of people, from the past to the present, who have with\
  \ them the same reason of union: the crossing line of the faith."
