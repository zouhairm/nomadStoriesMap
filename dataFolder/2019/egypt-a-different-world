Text: "Pristine yet dross. I didn\u2019t expect those to be the first words to come\
  \ to mind when thinking about my travels through Egypt and down the Nile. \n\nI\
  \ am a seasoned traveler so my expectations of Egypt was for it to have some similarities\
  \ to other low and middle income countries I have been to: evident income gaps and\
  \ litter strewn about. However, I was not prepared for the sights I saw and experienced.\
  \ \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to see such extremes in one place. I was amazed at how\
  \ well kept and pristine the excavation sites and tombs were at Valley of the Kings.\
  \ In front of me, I saw gorgeous, colorful hieroglyphics so clearly legible. You\
  \ could see the yellows, reds, and blues that had been painted into and around the\
  \ carvings thousands of years ago. The colors were so bright as if they had just\
  \ been painted a few days ago, now a few thousand years ago. \n\nThen I turned the\
  \ corner\u2026\n\nI came face to face with crushed soda cans and empty water bottles\
  \ stuffed inside the window barriers of sacred places. It was evident that tourists\
  \ and locals regarded these sacred and historical places as dross. Otherwise they\
  \ wouldn\u2019t have so disrespectfully and shamelessly turned the windows around\
  \ a mosque into a trash can. \n\nSince it was a mosque it was hard to discern if\
  \ tourists had left it or if it was accumulated by locals. Either way, I would urge\
  \ both tourists and locals to work better to preserve these historical sites so\
  \ they remain as pristine years from now. So that as more tourists come to explore\
  \ this underrated country the problem doesn\u2019t increase and ruin the immaculate\
  \ nature of historical preservation the depths of this country have. \n\n[I would\
  \ attache the images I have of both the pristine hieroglyphics and the liter stuffed\
  \ into the window barricade, so truly showcase the drastic up keep of historical\
  \ and sacred Egyptian sites.]"
