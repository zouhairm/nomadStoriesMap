Text: "We met 5 years ago. I was 17, he was 16. He would look at me and my friend,\
  \ he would look at us, how we hugged and smiled. He would look, eager to start the\
  \ \u201Cadventure\u201D, but shyness will be holding him back. We sat on the bus\
  \ together. Not in the same row. But we talked. All of us. We were teenagers. We\
  \ wanted to know everything about everyone. And he talked to me and I talked to\
  \ him. I could see this kind of new happiness rising inside him. Cautious happiness\
  \ that appears when you feel you\u2019ve met someone special when you feel so comfortable\
  \ as if you\u2019ve been together your entire life. I also felt it. A thought could\
  \ not escape my mind. \u201CBoys like him had never talked to me the way he does\u201D\
  . I felt we could be friends. This had never happened to me before. I was a stranger.\
  \ He was a stranger to me. And it did not matter. \n\nFor the next two weeks, we\
  \ became one. I was him. He was me. We were fire. We used to kiss, like kindergarten\
  \ children, at the swimming pool, after the sessions, only on our lips, no love,\
  \ no sex. We used to hug, for so long, so real. We used to talk. And when we talked,\
  \ we were safe. The walls that we carried to protect ourselves had fallen. It was\
  \ just him and me. Just me and him. We held each other\u2019s hands while we cried,\
  \ as we shared our fears out loud. He asked me if I wanted him to kiss me on the\
  \ last night. A real kiss. I had been waiting for that moment for so long. I hesitated.\
  \ We walked in front of me. I stopped him. We kissed. A real one. We looked in each\
  \ other's eyes, so close, we laughed. From that moment on, we knew we were not meant\
  \ to be sexually attracted to each other. \n\nA year later I moved to his city,\
  \ to be closer to him. We spent three months together. We drank, smoked, watched\
  \ sunrises, walked the streets at night, I got my first tattoo in a sketchy house\
  \ with a sketchy girl while he was holding my hand. Then I left, I went on another\
  \ \u201Cadventure\u201D. No internet connection, no phones, no communication with\
  \ the outside world. Each Friday we received messages from family and friends. Four\
  \ Fridays I waited to receive a message from him. It didn\u2019t happen. Our paths\
  \ diverged. He went away to distant lands. I went home. He was living new experiences,\
  \ so was I. Because home had not been home for too long. But then darkness came\
  \ and, a year later, I needed to hear his voice. And I never did. \n\nNow almost\
  \ four years from our last goodbye he keeps coming back to me. In nightmares where\
  \ I punch him, or I cry. He keeps coming back. On new friendships that never go\
  \ anywhere. I believe it is because somehow I can\u2019t let this happen to me again.\
  \ I do not want to feel the emptiness. I fear this story will repeat itself. \n\n\
  On this day, I believe that to grow older is to understand that all those so-real\
  \ things you lived, so intense, so deep, are gone. That they were real, they were\
  \ the truth, but not anymore. Now they\u2019re pieces of what used to be, fragments\
  \ of broken memories. \n\n- I wish I had found this awesome opportunity before.\
  \ Now only a few hours to closing, I submit this story I know doesn't fit the requirements.\
  \ I hope you enjoy it. -"
