Text: "The lights of my city were consumed by the thick darkness of a December\u2019\
  s night, while the minibus\u2019 motor lulled the dreams of passengers around me:\
  \ my companions on this adventure more than 300 km long. Our arrival to the border\
  \ was at dawn, but a layer of clouds up in the atmosphere would not let us watch\
  \ the sun; in fact, a few raindrops signed our welcome to Panama.\nNever had I ever\
  \ taken a single step out of my country, and so, crossing the bridge over the river\
  \ which separates us, by foot, encased an unexplainable mysticism but also incongruous\
  \ with the humid heat of the Caribbean and the tall weeds that covered the riverbank.\
  \ This place didn\u2019t look like a border, but any other riverbed, any other bridge,\
  \ any other tropical walk. Nonetheless, our entry to Panama was marked by something\
  \ more tangible than dividing lines in ancient maps: two soldiers with their respective\
  \ weapons, asking for our passports before letting anyone who was crossing from\
  \ Costa Rica enter their country. \nTheir serious and firm gaze and words were not\
  \ at all similar to my experience with my country\u2019s police, which had been\
  \ only a police officer giving a speech about the danger of drugs, back in high\
  \ school. As a matter of fact, I think I\u2019d never been so close to a weapon\
  \ in my life.\nPanama\u2019s natural and rural landscape wasn\u2019t very much different\
  \ from Costa Rica\u2019s, and neither were the roads. When we arrived at our first\
  \ shopping-stop we could note that a vast majority -if not all- of the population\
  \ was indigenous, something I\u2019d never seen in my country. I decided then to\
  \ walk all over the shops and stores, and I even bought a SIM card so I could speak\
  \ to my family, so I trusted an old souvenir seller. In that same city, I witnessed\
  \ a when a man who was lying down on a sidewalk -presumably for drinking too much\
  \ alcohol- was robbed his watch. The robber also searched his victim\u2019s pockets.\
  \ I got away as fast as I could, while no one seemed to even notice the event.\n\
  However, my first encounter with soldiers and their weapons, and my first witnessing\
  \ of a robbery were not the important part of my trip to Panama. As we got closer\
  \ to Almirante, the dock from which we would set sail to Col\xF3n, the landscape\
  \ started to change, taking a more Caribbean feel. After more than half an hour\
  \ on a boat, drinking tequila and taking pictures, we arrived at Col\xF3n, which\
  \ has one of the most colorful scenes my eyes have beholden, with graciously painted\
  \ buildings along seashore. \nAfter checking in and leaving our luggage in the hotel,\
  \ we went on to Carenero Island, where we had lunch (at four o\u2019clock in the\
  \ afternoon) in the most tropical atmosphere possible. There, surrounded by sea\
  \ mist, the sound of waves and reggae music, I looked up to the horizon and thought\
  \ to myself this is the life I deserved. Without any doubt, whilst I was sleeping\
  \ on that beach chair, I got my mind to reach my body (I had left it at home) so\
  \ I could really enjoy this trip the way I should.\nMy life was surrounded by saltwater,\
  \ docks, bicycle rides, sun, reefs, and marine life in general for four days; far\
  \ away from my messy city, mounted on a valley, girded by mountains and wind. Those\
  \ were the moments I realized that travelling is not being far from home but making\
  \ any destination your home."
