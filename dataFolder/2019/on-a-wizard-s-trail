Text: "The idea had always been to go by car. As we sat at the airport in Oaxaca,\
  \ filling out an incident form - attempting to explain to my insurance company how\
  \ a massive SUV purposely rammed into our tiny two-door rental, while fleeing the\
  \ police during a checkpoint - it was becoming exponentially clear that driving\
  \ across the country was out of the question. \n\nI had met Chloe, my best friend,\
  \ a mere 48 hours earlier, and our trip had already arrived at its first major hurdle.\
  \ For us, the goal was always to see as much as possible in the short time we had\
  \ but we had planned a visit to Las Pozas, as the ultimate highlight. The cluster\
  \ of surrealistic structures created by Edward James - a wildly rich and eccentric\
  \ British poet - piqued our interest, long before the trip ever took place. Located\
  \ in the mountains of a subtropical rainforest, however, it was not an easy place\
  \ to get to. Mexico has no railway system, so while I used my broken Spanish to\
  \ explain to our Hertz attendant why the trunk of our car was tied closed with the\
  \ cable of my iPhone charger, Chloe was frantically checking how many hours of bus\
  \ rides were ahead of us. \n\nSeveral days later, still determined to reach this\
  \ remote and mystical place, we found ourselves in the bus station of Ciudad Valles.\
  \ We arrived early in the morning, after a 13-hour bus ride,  our second that week.\
  \ After a drowsy conversation with a taxi driver, we managed to make it to our Airbnb\
  \ in Mirador, a neighborhood in the south of the city where small buildings, only\
  \ two or three stories high speckled the horizon, and the streets were nearly empty.\
  \ In order to get us to Las Pozas as quickly as possible, the proud optician who\
  \ rented us the room above his office had arranged for a friendly taxi driver to\
  \ take us there. \n\nThe ride was extremely bumpy thanks to Mexico\u2019s topes\
  \ - ruthless metal speed bumps - combined with our elderly chauffeur\u2019s inability\
  \ to see them. During our travels through the country, it never ceased to amaze\
  \ me how quickly and immensely the terrain could change. In under two hours, we\
  \ drove through busy towns and nearly empty highways, roads enveloped by green trees\
  \ and others caught between desolate sandy planes. \n\nIt was right before noon\
  \ when we arrived at the entrance of Las Pozas, where we were met by food vendors.\
  \ Amused by my accent they gave us their recommendations and we entered armed with\
  \ snacks. Even here, in the middle of nowhere, we had reluctantly expected to find\
  \ long lines, hordes of tourists and cheap knick-knacks for sale. Instead, we were\
  \ faced with a nearly empty concrete playground to explore. We were left to wander\
  \ the lavish bushes only seldom coming across other visitors, and very few of them\
  \ foreign. \n\nThe garden sits amidst acres of jungles full of natural pools and\
  \ waterfalls intertwined with massive cement sculptures that at first glance look\
  \ like unfinished buildings. Structures up to four stories high poke through the\
  \ luscious leaves and vines. Countless trails made from small stone steps lead to\
  \ through winding walkways to ramps, towers, and bridges covered in green moss and\
  \ lichen. Climbing through staircases, which lead to nowhere, ending abruptly in\
  \ between floors feels like walking through a exquisitely mad man\u2019s mind. \n\
  \nConstruction on the garden began in the 1940\u2019s, meaning that while the whole\
  \ world was still coming to terms with the brutal post-war realities, James was\
  \ deep within the Mexican jungle creating, simply for the sake of creating, caught\
  \ in the whirlwind of his own imagination. To devout one\u2019s life to such a project\
  \ is a rare luxury; a freedom bestowed on only a handful of individuals throughout\
  \ history. Being in Las Pozas means bearing witness to tangible proof that the wildest,\
  \ most indescribable dreams can indeed become reality. It is a sublime demonstration\
  \ that anything you ever thought was humanly possible can not only be achieved but\
  \ also outdone. It inspires one to aim higher, bigger, better, wilder. It is real\
  \ magic in a world that has been sucked nearly dry of such elements."
