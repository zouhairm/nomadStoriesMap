Text: "I haven't seen the film Tomb Raider, so it wasn't until after this happened\
  \ to me that I found out it was pretty much a scene straight out of the movie. \n\
  \nThe film was shot close to Angkor Wat, in Cambodia, at these temples where I actually\
  \ got to visit. In the film I guess Angelina Jolie is attracted by fauna, butterflies,\
  \ and a child to this secret entrance. Well, the exact same thing happened to me.\
  \ \n\nI was following these butterflies and drawn in by the beauty of the flora\
  \ when all of a sudden this little boy appeared. He was coy and playful, and clearly\
  \ wanted a companion. So I shyly followed him.\n\nHe led me to an entirely different\
  \ and barred off area of one of the temples. As he spoke Cambodian, and I only spoke\
  \ English, we couldn\u2019t communicate verbally. For a moment I hesitated, but\
  \ as he was 4 feet high and clearly luring me in, I soon acquiesced.\n\nIn our adventures\
  \ we scrambled in (structurally dangerous) forbidden areas, up and over all these\
  \ broken rocks and caved in sections, until lo and behold we came upon a scorpion!\
  \ He laughed at my terror, it was huge and black (which apparently equals harmless.\
  \ It\u2019s the small white ones you have to look out for), and simply stabbed its'\
  \ stinger so it was rendered defenseless. I breathed again.\n\nWe locked eyes. Then\
  \ he picked the scorpion up with this smart aleck look, by the tail, and threw it\
  \ against the wall as if it was an orange peel. All of a sudden he seemed 6 foot\
  \ 4, my hero. He could read this in my body language, so he knew that the game could\
  \ now continue."
