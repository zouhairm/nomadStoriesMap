Text: "How do we learn what is worth appreciating and what is merely worth accepting\
  \ as a given in life? Do we under-appreciate due to a lack of knowledge and understanding?\
  \ And why do we appreciate things, what value does it give to our soul?\n\nI am\
  \ writing this sat in an ashram and appreciation as a force or thought has never\
  \ been so raw or powerful as it is now. The sparseness of my environment and what\
  \ is available to me heightens what I truly value in life, what I find pleasure\
  \ in and what I take for granted.\n\nLast night on the way back from Satsang (where\
  \ as a group we meditate and chant together) we were given a palm full of dense,\
  \ dried fruit and nut-studded sugary cake like thing on the way out. I took a bite\
  \ on my way down the stairs back to my room and my heart sang. After a strict vegetarian\
  \ diet for the past 5 days this just blew my tastebuds away. This genuine joy rushed\
  \ through my body exploding into the biggest smile I could manage on my face. I\
  \ was alone, my reaction was for the benefit of nobody but myself, the trees and\
  \ the moon. I appreciated that moment was given to me, I appreciated the sweetness\
  \ of whatever it was I was eating and how it brought feelings of indulgence and\
  \ happiness.\n\nThis week I have also had similar reactions to the chai masala we\
  \ sip in the morning (the only tea we get all day - I try and down 3 cups before\
  \ our 8am yoga session), the papaya chunks we consume in the afternoon and the Love\
  \ Heart sweets I discovered in the little gift my mum had wrapped for me for my\
  \ 7th week of travelling. But back home I wouldn\u2019t appreciate these things.\
  \ I appreciate things like when it\u2019s a 1 minute wait for the next tube, that\
  \ my phone battery lasts until I get home from work or that I am able to book a\
  \ last minute pedicure at the exact time and day I need it. Is that bad? Or is it\
  \ all relative? The Indians adore the rain because for them it means nutrition for\
  \ the crops which equals food and income. And how we react to rain in England? We\
  \ moan!\n\nThink about when you have been camping. How much do you appreciate your\
  \ own bed, a clean toilet and a warm shower when you get back home? We need to be\
  \ stripped of things, forbidden from them, to realise their worth within our lives.\n\
  \nHaving travelled around Asia for almost 2 months I do believe that the Western\
  \ world takes way too much for granted. We have infrastructures, sanitation, democracy.\
  \ We don\u2019t have to worry about getting to work safely or manoeuvre around the\
  \ mountains of plastic waste simply to walk to the local shop or worry that our\
  \ government is corrupt and doesn\u2019t reinvest into our country. Even the poorest\
  \ of people within the Western world have these things. When are we going to realise\
  \ how rich we are in our hearts, mind and soul and begin to appreciate the simple\
  \ things? Don\u2019t look to money, alcohol, holidays, partying or clothes to make\
  \ you happy. There is no doubt that they are there as a wonderful overture to the\
  \ adventure we are on. But smell a newly blossomed flower, capture the sound of\
  \ a loved one laughing, enjoy the sensation of purified, safe water dripping down\
  \ your throat and understand the generosity the world has given you. Once you can\
  \ find joy in the smaller things, life becomes so much more beautiful."
