Text: "From the train it became clear that Belarus is a radically new country - as\
  \ soon as we crossed the border with Ukraine, the conductor looked up to a coupe\
  \ and asked my friend Nikita and me not to laugh. \n\nThe first thing that you see\
  \ in the subway near Minsk Train Station is a large sculpture of sickle and hammer,\
  \ the emblem of the USSR. I wanted to make a photo, but Nikita stop me - it\u2019\
  s forbidden because subway is a strategic object. And if you took a picture of it,\
  \ you\u2019ll went to the prison for 15 days. \n\nWhen we got out of the subway,\
  \ Sasha has already waited for us. She is a Belarusian student activist. We walked\
  \ down the empty prospectus without any little shops, any rubbish and full with\
  \ police, who were more than simple citizens. The main square of \u200B\u200Bthe\
  \ country was inspected by them and we looked if police follows us. A huge former\
  \ administrative building - made with a glass and concrete, the locality calls a\
  \ sarcophagus - was empty. On the facade hanged the big TV with the advertising\
  \ of chewing gum \"Love is ...\".\n\nWalking Minsk\u2019s street felt like walking\
  \ through the USSR. After the World War II the city was raze to the ground and authority\
  \ decided to rebuilt it rapidly. Because of this you can see Stalin Empire, Modernism,\
  \ \u201CKhrushchevian\u201D - and if you look behind the horn you\u2019ll notice\
  \ an \u201Cautozak\u201D - policie\u2019s lorry in the middle of the city. It uses\
  \ to take away people who did not agree with authorities. - gathered over the voice,\
  \ swore, was gathered. Of course, it's not a good idea to photograph him - otherwise\
  \ you can find yourself inside. \n\nIn fact, I came to Minsk to share my experience\
  \ of organization of students protests in Kyiv. So we set in the secret office of\
  \ Sasha\u2019s organization, listened to Ukrainian independent band Okean Elzy.\
  \ I look out the window on the frosty sky, while Sasha told me:\n\n\u201CPolice\
  \ can do what they want and get away with it. They could arrest dumb people because\
  \ of the exclamation of antiparty slogans, people without hands - because of applause\
  \ at a silent protest. They can arrest us because of national slogans or national\
  \ flag of independent Belarus\u201D.\n\nFormally, Belarus is independent, but it\
  \ remains the last dictatorship in Europe - Lukashenko took the antidemocratic course\
  \ on Russia and country changed a little from the times of the USSR. Even the flag\
  \ and the emblem of Belarus are just copies of the same symbols from the USSR. Nobody\
  \ here uses any symbols - the official aren\u2019t recognized by people, the people's\
  \ are not allowed by the authorities. \n\nIt is also forbidden to put likes under\
  \ the posts against the authorities, to schedule meetings and to organize protests.\
  \ Sasha says that the worst situation was on the Square in 2010 - after elections\
  \ Lukashenko again become a president, so  thousands of people were disagree and\
  \ came on the street. AMAP, local special forces, brutally beat that people - banged\
  \ their bones and they were lying in \u201Cautozals\u201D for hours or on the cold\
  \ square without any medical assistance.\n\nSasha speaks about it in Belarusian\
  \ - we understand each other without problems. I bought books in Belarusian and\
  \ tried to speak with locals in Belarusian, but they answered in Russian - almost\
  \ 90% do. There is even no Belarusian in school - and this is legitimate by Lukashenko.\n\
  \nWe\u2019re sitting in the front of window. Sasha looks somewhere away through\
  \ it and says that she doesn\u2019t believe in change. At least not her generation\
  \ will succeed. Of course, there\u2019re some good trends - there are 2 opposition\
  \ deputies in the Belarusian parliament for the first time in last 10 years. Sasha\
  \ does not believe, but calmly wait.\n\nI left Minsk in a few days, carefully transported\
  \ across the border the flag of Ukraine in a backpack - there were nationalist Belarusian\
  \ slogans. A month later, on the Zen Wolie - the day of their independence of Belarus,\
  \ more than a thousand people were dispersed by AMAP. My friend then wrote: the\
  \ most scary thing was when che ran and AMAP ran after her. But Belarusians are\
  \ calmly and patiently - as always."
