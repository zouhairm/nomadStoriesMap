Text: "In 1947, Sir Cyril Radcliffe partitioned The British India into two dominions,\
  \ India and Pakistan. The International Border, recognized as the Radcliffe Line,\
  \ strangely, changed the course of millions of lives, leaving a disputed territory,\
  \ the blessed land of Kashmir. I had been cautioned about the peril following a\
  \ suicide bombing at Pulwama, but by then, my heart had already sailed off to those\
  \ beautiful meadows, the crystal clear lakes and the lofty snowcapped mountains.\
  \ Jhelum, roaring at a distance, was music under the clear blue skies. It was evening\
  \ as usual at Lal Chowk as I had made myself at home with Hamid and his wife Safina.\
  \ Safina was preparing wholesome Rogan Josh, a Kashmiri delicacy Hamid insisted\
  \ that I must try. Meanwhile, Hamid walked me to a secret look-out which he claimed\
  \ was a secret jewel in the valley. The sunset was unreal, showering the landscape\
  \ with soothing warm tones. On our way back, lost in conversations about his life\
  \ in Kashmir, I asked Hamid, \u201CAren\u2019t you worried about the unrest surrounding\
  \ the attacks?\u201D. Suddenly, his walk slowed down. His eyes welled up and his\
  \ face filled with gloom. I walked towards him, \u201CWhat happened?\u201D I asked\
  \ him, raising my hand to his shoulder. He looked at me with painful eyes and said,\
  \ \u201CSahab, the suicide bomber was a 20 year old. He was Abdul\u2019s son. My\
  \ son was just 4 years older and used to play with him in these streets when they\
  \ were young. That is where his family lives\u201D, he said, pointing his wrinkled\
  \ arms towards a decrepit balcony over-looking the street.  \u201CA few years ago,\
  \ he was returning from school with some of his friends when they were arrested\
  \ and tortured by an Indian troop, being accused of stone-pelting in the area\u201D\
  \ he continued, \u201CThey say, he was driven by anguish. Violence is common in\
  \ Kashmir. It doesn\u2019t scare us anymore. What scares us is that they know how\
  \ to exploit our children for their purpose\u201D. Dumbfounded by this revelation,\
  \ we continued a silent walk home. The fragrance of Kashmiri spices, tingled my\
  \ senses as Safina opened the door with a smile. \u201CIt smells great!\u201D, I\
  \ said as I smiled back at her. \u201CSo Hamid, will your son be joining us for\
  \ dinner?\u201D, I asked him to break the silence. He looked up to me and said,\
  \ \u201CNo Sahab, he won\u2019t\u201D. I saw the smile on Safina\u2019s face disappear.\
  \ \u201CHe was one of the 40 CRPF jawaaans who were martyred in the Pulwama Attack\u201D\
  . \nThe chaos from the street below drowned into silence. I could feel my fingers\
  \ tremble as my heart flooded with emotions. A wave of thoughts drowned my voice\
  \ and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder, would this have happened if the Radcliffe\
  \ Line wouldn\u2019t have existed?"
