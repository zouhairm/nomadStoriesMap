Text: "Although I study war \u2013 the battles, the tactics and formations used, assault\
  \ plans and key personalities, I am more of a watcher than a doer. Having never\
  \ been in battle, I do not know how I would cope physically and mentally with such\
  \ a proposition, but I do have the utmost respect for those who do and whether you\
  \ were fighting along with the Allied or with the Axis Powers, both sides deserve\
  \ to be recognised for fighting for what they believed in, or were made to believe\
  \ in.\n\nI can still hear my Oma\u2019s voice saying to me when I was seven when\
  \ we visited a German War Cemetery in Ysselsteyn, \u2018Remember Saskia, not everyone\
  \ buried here was a Nazi, and not everyone here wanted to fight, but a lot were\
  \ young boys who had too.\u2019 This always stuck with me, after all my Oma had\
  \ lived through the war and had seen these young men, not as soldiers, but as someone\u2019\
  s son and loved ones.\n\nShe was a wise woman.\n\nSo it was while we were in Normandy\
  \ that we went to pay our respects at an American, a British and a German cemetery.\
  \ After all, the boys buried here were just that \u2013 boys who, no matter on what\
  \ side they fought, had families and loved ones who grieved for their passing and\
  \ were left to pick up the pieces after the war ended.\n\nI find it a great comfort\
  \ that no matter where in the world you are, or which \u2018side\u2019 you visit,\
  \ in every war cemetery the graves are maintained to a high standard and there are\
  \ usually people visiting at the same time as you. Furthermore the visitors guest\
  \ book shows it is a popular place of pilgrimage even after all these years and\
  \ the wreaths and flowers laid out are a testament to this.\n\nThe heart-felt messages\
  \ inscribed on the graves are hard for me to take sometimes \u2013 the feelings\
  \ of pride, love and even anger show this war was hard on everyone. One young lad\
  \ I found buried in the Jerusalem War Cemetery in Chouain, was just 16 and his inscription\
  \ made me weep. \u2018God will tell us why some-day he broke our hearts and took\
  \ you away.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s hard to walk around this area of France and not be\
  \ affected by your surroundings. On the beaches made famous; Sword, Gold, Omaha,\
  \ Utah you can still find remnants of the war within the water, lying on the beach\
  \ and up in the hills.\n\nAfter visiting Sword and looking at the bunkers and the\
  \ German command post with the view over the beaches, you must wonder, what did\
  \ they think when they saw the boats coming into land?\n\nWe made our way to Omaha\
  \ and attempted to run up from the beach to the high point.\n\nThis was exhausting\
  \ work and I had to stop often to catch my breathe and watch my footing. Moreover,\
  \ I got to do this without having people shooting at me, being wounded and killed\
  \ around me, without a pack on my back \u2013 I struggled now, how would I have\
  \ ever coped with the reality?\n\nMartin Luther King once said \u201CIn the end,\
  \ we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.\u201D\
  \ These were boys, much younger than I am now who had to leave their families and\
  \ lay down their lives for the cause. It happened on both sides, and in the end\
  \ the cemeteries scattered around Normandy speak more loudly peace. The boys have\
  \ found unity in death. Their silence, their memorials will continue to resonant\
  \ loudly.\n\nWe Will Remember Them"
