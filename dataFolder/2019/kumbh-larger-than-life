Text: "I\u2019d been telling him (husband) to make reservations for our travel to\
  \ the 2019 Kumbh Mela-the largest peaceful gathering in the world, also a UNESCO\
  \ Intangible Cultural Heritage to be held at Prayagraj (Uttar Pradesh), India, \
  \ the main festival site for the Kumbh.  A Hindu myself, I only knew that the Kumbh\
  \ was a Hindu Pilgrimage where Hindus gather to bathe in a holy river and this time\
  \ it was being held at Prayagraj. I gathered, it just wasn\u2019t one river but\
  \ three- the Ganga or the Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati and the point where\
  \ the three meet -  \u201Cthe Sangam\u201D. Actually it was something else that\
  \ caught my fantasy, the idea that everyone was visiting the Kumbh, except me. Yes,\
  \ everyone. This time, it seemed as if everyone I\u2019d  spoken to, was going or\
  \ had just returned from there. I finally booked my flights to Varanasi , instead\
  \ of Prayagraj, it was cheaper and was only 3 hours drive to the Kumbh. This seemed\
  \ like the right thing to do. We stayed at Hotel Varanasi Heritage and  I can\u2019\
  t even say how many visitors from different countries were staying at our hotel\
  \ than people from our own-all were there to visit the Kumbh. I\u2019d never realized\
  \ that the Kumbh would be such a big thing, until this day, when I saw it myself.\
  \ As a child I\u2019d always heard people say that if one goes to the Kumbh, then\
  \ chances are that you will be parted from your family or people you are visiting\
  \ with because the place gets overtly crowded. However those were the days when\
  \ there were no cell phones or public audio systems. But this year, the state government\
  \ had made world class arrangements for the visitors and pilgrims.The place was\
  \ clean, had all the amenities.  It took almost the entire day for us to reach Kumbh,\
  \ the massive traffic jam, as if not just the whole country but the entire world\
  \ was here. Finally at 4:30 p.m. I asked a boat driver to take us at the Sangam\
  \ point and when we got there, I forgot the hassles I\u2019d gone through just to\
  \ get to this place. The meeting point of the three rivers, one can clearly see\
  \ the difference in the color of their water. We reached the Ghat (place of taking\
  \ the holy bath) where we were welcomed by a Hindu priest who then performed a small\
  \ Puja ( a prayer service) for us. And we made our offerings to the holy waters.\
  \ Though I cannot explain my emotions, but as I took a holy dip into the sacred\
  \ waters of the three rivers, tears rolled down my eyes and I cried like a baby.\
  \ Why have I never come to visit this place earlier? That moment felt pure and sacred,\
  \ a moment of self discovery, of who I am \u2013a Hindu. This is the place where\
  \ of drops of Amrit- drink of immortality were spilled according to Hindu mythology,\
  \ I felt it slipped inside me through my skin. I certainly believe in the mythology\
  \ behind the Kumbh and felt the presence of the divine power which had brought billions\
  \ of people together in peace. As I looked around, I found thousands of people taking\
  \ their holy dips, filled with joy. The scent of marigold flowers and incense sticks\
  \ got into my nostrils purifying my soul, the breeze caressing my hair. The sight\
  \ of this place where celebrations didn\u2019t stop even for a moment and people\
  \ flowing in like birds coming back to their homes, seeking salvation. The sight\
  \ was a never ending festival where people come to wash their sins and purify their\
  \ hearts."
