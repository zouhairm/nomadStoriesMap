Text: "I am not a very religious person. I don't deny the existence of God nor do\
  \ I affirm it. However, the one thing I do believe with every fiber of my being,\
  \ 100% without a doubt is that whoever is running the show, Jesus, Vishnu, Allah,\
  \ the Universe, whoever it is, has a peculiar sense of humor. And like all good\
  \ beliefs, mine has been tested and reaffirmed time and time again, and now as I\
  \ sit upon my desk getting ready to tell this story I realize that it's been exactly\
  \ one year since it all started, this day, last year, I made a decision that would\
  \ change my life forever. Let me give you a little context, it's February 2017,\
  \ Donald Trump has just become president and I am not happy. Not about the Trump\
  \ thing, well not entirely, I am unhappy about my life, I am unhappy with my major,\
  \ Space Science, and how everyone else in my program has been dreaming of going\
  \ to space since they were seven and practically worship Chris Hadfield and his\
  \ bland guitar playing in 0 gravity videos (I mean seriously? I\u2019ve seen mashed\
  \ potatoes with more pazazz). I am unhappy with my boring 9-5 campus job that I\
  \ could easily do from home and finish a weeks work in about 2 hours (fun fact:\
  \ I finished \u2018the office\u2019, \u2018friends\u2019, and the \u201870s show,\
  \ \u201Cworking\u201D there). I am unhappy with my girlfriend who wants to wait\
  \ till shes 30 to travel and think\u2019s walking around campus when it's dark out\
  \ is \u2018thrilling\u2019. I am unhappy with who I am and what I am doing and how\
  \ my time is being spent doing things I don\u2019t want to do to impress people\
  \ I don\u2019t like. And so I do the only thing I know I am good at, I quit. I quit\
  \ my job, I drop out of school, I break up with my girlfriend and I feel absolutely\
  \ great, I had this liberated sense of excitement that lasted a good two minutes\
  \ before the existential dread kicked in and I began to ask myself, now what? I\
  \ knew I wanted to travel, I also knew I had about two weeks before my parents would\
  \ find out I am not in school and all hell would break loose, and so I decided on\
  \ doing the only sensible thing any 19 year old space science drop-out would do.\
  \ I booked a flight to Mexico City at 1 in the morning. Now it's important to note,\
  \ I had never traveled solo before, I knew no one in Mexico and the only Spanish\
  \ I knew was \u201CD\xF3nde est\xE1 un biblioteca?\u201D which translates to \u201C\
  where is the library\u201D (any community fans reading? Another show while slacking\
  \ at my campus job) But I was high on confidence and told myself that if I could\
  \ do this, I could do anything, maybe a bit naive and childish, but it worked. Spoiler\
  \ alert, I didn\u2019t die in Mexico and the trip was an absolute blast, I met other\
  \ travelers like me, explored dormant volcanoes, ate amazing street food and learned\
  \ the time told lesson every wise traveler knows: don\u2019t drink the water. Seriously\
  \ buy bottled water, you\u2019ll thank me later. On the surface, going to Mexico\
  \ after Trump's inauguration is a comical point in my life and maybe this was an\
  \ escape for me, maybe it was just a joy ride to celebrate my freedom because I\
  \ knew that when I went back home things wouldn\u2019t be the same, but when I woke\
  \ up after my first night in Mexico City and walked outside on the coral colored\
  \ pavement as the warm sun sent goosebumps across my skin and the light Mexican\
  \ breeze filled my lungs, for that moment in time I felt like I hadn\u2019t felt\
  \ in a long, long time, I felt at peace. And for that moment, it was all worth it."
