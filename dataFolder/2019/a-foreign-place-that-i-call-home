Text: "A Foreign Place that I call Home\n\n    I was in a four-hour flight from Dubai\
  \ to Kathmandu and I can still clearly remember how days went by before I left Dubai\
  \ for a foreign land I\u2019ve never been to. I dream about walking through the\
  \ streets of Kathmandu, observing how chaotic the city is, eating local food, and\
  \ meeting fellow travelers all over the world. I know myself that I will be that\
  \ common foreigner going to a foreign land with no comprehensive knowledge of. I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect much as it\u2019s my first country to travel to alone. To my\
  \ surprise it didn\u2019t happen that way. I went to Kathmandu not just for the\
  \ culture and new experience it can give but to meet with a local that I never met\
  \ before. As I went out of the Tribhuvan International Airport, I am greeted cheerfully\
  \ by a friend that I will treasure for life, we hugged so tight like we are sisters\
  \ that didn\u2019t see each other for years.\n\n    My first night in Kathmandu,\
  \ I ate food which was cooked by the family\u2019s house keeper and my friend\u2019\
  s mother. Nothing beats home cooked meals that I never went out to eat food during\
  \ my stay. I ate everything that they give me. I enjoyed every Dal Bhat they offered\
  \ me, we sat on the floor to eat which is a bit unusual for me but it made my meal\
  \ more special. From Kathmandu, we went on a long ride to Pokhara. Through that\
  \ long ride I saw how beautiful Nepal is. The country side is serene and innocent\
  \ on its own. I am welcomed by the endless mountain ranges, dainty cafeterias, bridges,\
  \ and river streams. In the middle of that journey a young man hopped on carrying\
  \ an instrument and started singing, and from that I felt how novel traveling can\
  \ be. I did everything what first-time travelers would do. I went to see the attractions\
  \ and eat anything new from morning to dusk, and from dusk till dawn I mingled with\
  \ travelers and locals while drinking local beers and I never felt so free before.\
  \ \n\n    In Kathmandu I visited temples. I was with my friend\u2019s mother when\
  \ I went to the temples of the city. With a language barrier, we carry on and spoke\
  \ through facial expressions and gestures. It was a one-of-a-kind experience to\
  \ me. Language barrier can be a disadvantage for foreigners when traveling but for\
  \ me it isn\u2019t. It is the most genuine and heart-warming experience I had while\
  \ traveling Nepal. I learned that language isn\u2019t necessary to understand everything\
  \ at all. From Pashupatinath Temple to Boudhanath, riding public transport, going\
  \ to a market to shop for dinner, buying the best pashminas in the city \u2014 my\
  \ mother from Nepal knows how to do it with ease. \n\n    While walking the Patan\
  \ Durbar Square I saw locals and foreigners flock in front of a door. From that\
  \ I know that it is the purpose why we went in Patan that day, to see the procession\
  \ of the Kumari Devi (Living Goddess). As time pass by, more people flock. I didn\u2019\
  t mind it that much, my attention is focused on the architecture of the buildings\
  \ and the fact that its artistic heritage overwhelms me. After an hour I am called\
  \ lucky by friends and locals. I saw the Kumari with my own eyes and that\u2019\
  s when I understand that the culture in here can\u2019t be compared from the culture\
  \ where I grew up to. To see a Living Goddess who is rarely seen by the public,\
  \ it convinced me that I am indeed lucky. After that we walked through the streets\
  \ of Thamel, bargained for souvenirs, ate street foods, talked about culture and\
  \ traditions, and observed how the night fall in the city of Kathmandu. \n\n   \
  \ I immersed myself with anything strange and new. I learned Nepal\u2019s culture,\
  \ its people, the good and the bad. I made friends and family that welcomed me and\
  \ took me as their own. I am lucky to have a place that I can call home and a family\
  \ that keep in touch with me after I left and said \u201CGoodbye, I\u2019ll be back\
  \ soon\u201D."
