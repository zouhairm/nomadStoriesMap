Text: "Peering down, my heart raced and pounded heavily, so heavily I could almost\
  \ hear the sound echo from behind my rib cage. Between my trembling forefinger and\
  \ thumb, an unfamiliar, maroon coloured object stared back at me. My passport.\n\
  \nNerves and excitement immediately constricted my body, my stomach felt as though\
  \ four tiny bell ringers where pulling onto ropes attached to my small intestine.\
  \ In exactly 2 weeks time, I would be embarking on my first ever solo trip to an\
  \ unknown country outside of my homely, happy, and protected comfort zone.\n\nThe\
  \ trip in question was only a short weekend break, but nevertheless a nerve wracking\
  \ and anxious new experience for someone like me. Shy, subdued but fiercely independent,\
  \ I hoped it would provide me with a new found sense of accomplishment and confidence.\
  \ After all, I had nothing to lose. \n\nWaving goodbye to my parents, I stepped\
  \ shakily onto the overnight ferry. A wave of sadness shadowed me as I willed for\
  \ them to magically return, scoop me up, and put me back safely in the rear of the\
  \ car. Taking a deep breath, I tried with every inch of my might to ignore the feelings\
  \ of impending doom clouding my subconscious, but I failed. I\u2019d always been\
  \ told I was melo-dramatic, but this was surely bafta winning, soap opera worthy.\
  \ \n\nOnce I had boarded the ferry, I made my way quickly to my allocated cabin,\
  \ as if I was trying to escape the fear I knew would eventually catch up to me and\
  \ eat me alive. Fumbling around the lock in the poorly lit corridor, I finally entered\
  \ my two berth cabin. The walls were poorly decorated in a revolting 1970s floral\
  \ pattern, and the bed was covered with a thin white sheet enough to keep only the\
  \ biggest polar bear just about warm, but queerly, I felt at ease. I was very aware\
  \ of the entertainment occuring onboard that night, however still feeling anxious\
  \ and exhausted I fell asleep almost immediately, only to be awoken by the early\
  \ announcement tannoy the next morning.\n\n\u2018A dummie\u2019s guide to Belgium\u2019\
  \ was my choice of read onboard the shuttle bus disembarking from the ferry port.\
  \ I flickered through the pages, taking in the colourful photos of old buildings,\
  \ interesting archeology, and picturesque canals. The bus was buzzing with couples,\
  \ families and groups of friends excited and ready to start their day ahead exploring\
  \ on a new adventure. Pulling into the parking bay, I felt a sigh of relief as I\
  \ faced a buzzing town square, immediately feeling relaxed and welcomed by the Belgian\
  \ community. Flags of the United Nations fluttered in the light summer breeze, a\
  \ ray of sunshine beaming down over my fair skin. It was unbelievable to think that,\
  \ just 24 hours ago, I was gripped with absolute fear and the inability to feel\
  \ anything positive about my first ever solo adventure. \n\nTrundling through the\
  \ old market square in the historic and truly remarkable Bruges, I felt as thought\
  \ I\u2019d lived here all my life. Street vendors smiled as I passed, offering me\
  \ sweet smelling flowers, Belgian chocolate and tourist information with no second\
  \ thoughts. I made my way into a small Belgian cafe, the smell of the coffee and\
  \ taste of the hot sandwiches tantalising every individual tastebud. The waitress\
  \ was a chatty, young girl, not much older than myself, with blonde hair tied back\
  \ in an unkempt ponytail. Her use of the English language was undeniably almost\
  \ better than my own, and the service she provided was impeccable. I grabbed my\
  \ phone and stole a photo of the old bay window I was sat near, with the town square\
  \ and the crowds of people fading behind it into the distance. I almost felt guilty\
  \ for the minute I spent on my phone, and immediately placed it down on the table,\
  \ as if not to miss a second more of the incredible scenery surrounding me. As I\
  \ stared into the street, my hands around a half full cup of warm coffee, I held\
  \ my head up and smiled. This was a Voyage of the Unknown. The best thing I\u2019\
  d ever done."
