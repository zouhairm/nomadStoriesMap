Text: "Locking the apartment door was the final au revoir to a three-day nightmare\
  \ of food poisoning; I was ready get into the sunlight. Two days earlier, while\
  \ laying on the floor cramped and nauseous, my wife and I decided to go on a hiking\
  \ trip in Hong Kong. The MacLehose Trail winds through the hills north of Hong Kong.\
  \ While it crosses country roads on its course, it manages to remain in the wild\
  \ with only bits of the metropolis peeking into panoramas of hills, forest, and\
  \ sea. We opted to hike fifty kilometers of it and had no idea what to expect.\n\
  \tWe crossed the border from mainland China and went into the city. We spent too\
  \ long buying gear the first day, so instead of in our tent, we spent the night\
  \ in a hotel\u2019s king-sized bed. In the morning, I hunkered down and cooked oatmeal\
  \ using our room\u2019s tea service. Soon after, we were off. A subway ride and\
  \ two buses brought us to trail marker 001, the beginning of the MacLehose. Hong\
  \ Kong being Hong Kong, there was a snack bar, so I bought some curried fish balls\
  \ and a chicken leg for the road. The trail is actually a road for the first nine\
  \ kilometers. We were constantly being passed by taxis carrying wiser hikers than\
  \ us to the end of the road. The tediousness of the pavement and car horns were\
  \ balanced by the serenity of walking beside a sparkling blue reservoir. We made\
  \ camp near the road that evening. As darkness fell we cooked dinner. Soon, snapping\
  \ branches and the crunch of heavy bodies announced unexpected visitors. Two cows\
  \ dropped by, and they could not believe we hadn\u2019t cooked anything for them.\
  \ I was worried they would trample our camp like a china shop. I tried to reason\
  \ with one; in response, I was given a forceful nuzzling and a lick. At my wit\u2019\
  s end, inspiration struck and I began clapping. That\u2019s how I discovered a 700\
  \ kilogram animal\u2019s only fear. The cows took off into the woods, and we ate\
  \ our dinner in peace. Sleep, though, was unsettled because each forest sound brought\
  \ visions of bovine vengeance.\_\n\tThe end of day two found us at a camp on the\
  \ beach far from the cows. I slept soundly and awoke to a golden sunrise over the\
  \ sea. Day three took us inland; the weather was fabulous, and the vistas just got\
  \ better and better. The next couple of nights, though, we discovered that mist\
  \ rolls over Hong Kong from dusk to dawn and loves to collect on things. We tucked\
  \ our backpacks in their rain covers each night and shook the dew off in the mornings.\
  \ The dampness and constant climbing were taking a toll. Fortunately, we were surprised\
  \ by bus stops at road crossings on our way, and we welcomed the chance to take\
  \ a break on such an easily accessible trail.\t\n\tWe returned three days later\
  \ with refreshed spirits and some Chinese takeout. I slept with my belly full of\
  \ dumplings and rice that night, and we set off in the morning. Here, the trail\
  \ was natural gravel and rock instead of sidewalk. Birds and butterflies had replaced\
  \ the crowds. I finally felt I was lost in the woods. We began to climb again, but\
  \ the slope was gentle. The views opened up around us as we hiked along a ridge.\
  \ The city, enormous and encompassing up close, was only miniature among deep, green\
  \ hills. We found others out enjoying the sunny day as well. We savored our lunch\
  \ while paragliders leapt into the wind and drifted above us.\_\n\tIn the afternoon,\
  \ our trail became stair steps, and we picked our way down toward the city again.\
  \ Soon we found ourselves on a roadway dodging cars while trying to take a picture\
  \ at the fifty kilometer marker. From there we traded trees for traffic lights and\
  \ cows for commuters. The hustle of the city intensifies the serenity of the trail,\
  \ which is something beyond my expectations. I was already planning my return."
