Text: So, i am a regular Adult from India, who likes to run, yes literally run and
  while i was running from my responsibility most of my teen . i thought why not run
  towards places with scenic view and that's how i began. My travel Blog www.travelwithshama.com,
  most of my trips are not even reported to my mom. But that is another story. I love
  travelling Solo or in a group of Three ( including Me), it's not like i am not people's
  person but it annoys me. I am also a bit of writer. i also know 3 languages apart
  from English. I love eating and tasting new food and talking to new people. I love
  adventure in any form. I also enjoy star gazing. My first love is my camera. Love
  taking portraits. so much interested in working like a Nat Geo Host. I love spending
  time learning something, with locals especially, Cooking classes, Food Walk, City
  tours are my forte. I have done a diploma in Travel and Tourism industry. Plan to
  cover the whole earth before it covers me. I want to be a Travel Channel Host when
  i feel like settling down and basically never settled down cause the whole earth
  is my home. A song that represent me is " I love the whole world" - Discovery Channel
  . I am also a environmentalist and believe in Green tourism. This Blue planet we
  call Home is my home and i am gonna fight to protect it.
