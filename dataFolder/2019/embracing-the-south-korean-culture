Text: "Mingling with the locals are no easy feat in this developed country. Even just\
  \ for buying a simple meal of ramyun or gigimbap through English communication medium\
  \ will send you away from some of the restaurants empty handed. You may experience\
  \ having to dine in food restaurants without even having english translated menus,\
  \ so good luck with the hand gestures of making the kindly ahjummas understand you.\
  \ Despite these, I still fell in love with this majestic country for being able\
  \ to retain its rich culture of historic places and modernized landmarks in one.\
  \ What you see in the photos of most of the labdmarks in the website will also be\
  \ what you will see once you set foot the nation. Apart from that, despite the language\
  \ barrier, the polite locals will always show you the right way if ever you got\
  \ lost, and will even compliment you when they feel like it. Good thing that from\
  \ watching korean dramas, I am able to decipher a bit of their language, because\
  \ I have experienced twice of locals complimenting my looks. \u201CIpeoda\u201D\
  , they say once they passed by me, with warm and parental smiles in their faces.\
  \ It means pretty or beautiful, in which I responded with the thank you in their\
  \ language. Hence, I recommended studying a bit of their language before going to\
  \ this beautiful country. You dont want stressing yourself out whether they might\
  \ be saying a bad remarks on you, are you?"
