Text: "Last year in June, I was invited to present my paper in Modern Heavy Metal\
  \ Conference 2018 in Helsinki, Finland. It was such a nice opportunity, more over\
  \ I also got to go to one of the well known Black Metal City. Oslo, Norway. Oslo\
  \ was the real journey, as I don't know anybody there, and I am wearing veil as\
  \ I am a Moslem woman. \n\nWhen I first landed in Oslo Airport, I was a bit worried\
  \ since I see no one was wearing veil like me, and unlike the friendly and warmth\
  \ atmosphere in Helsinki, Oslo was a bit Bronx. I met an old women when I went to\
  \ the toilet, and she looked so stressed and even told me that she couldn't stand\
  \ Oslo.  People said that Oslo is the most expensive city in the world, indeed it\
  \ is. To get to central city from the airport cost me 101 Nok or around $11,65.\n\
  \nIn Oslo central city, I saw lots of homeless. With no internet access, I look\
  \ for a phone card store by literally look at the maps that was in every bus stop.\
  \ That was my first journey counting on a real map, not GPS. Turned out, I still\
  \ able to read map correctly. After getting a signal for my cellphone, I went to\
  \ the official residence of the ambassador as  I was welcome to stay there as long\
  \ as I stay in Oslo. It is a great honor to be able to stay at the residence, although\
  \ the last night staying was quite a horror with some kind of a poltergeist thing.\
  \ \n\nAfter dropping my luggage and having lunch, I directly went to my first destination.\
  \ Helvete meaning hell in Nordic, or known as Nesblod. This is a record store, but\
  \ not just an ordinary record store. For Black Metal fans, this place is like their\
  \ historical place, as in the underground of the record store, there are black metal\
  \ museum. The place was made by Euronimous, Mayhem's guitarist. A legendary black\
  \ metal band from Norway.  This place was quite easy to find. It's not like a gigantic\
  \ record store, on the contrary, it is just a small two rooms store with vinyls.\
  \ cassettes, CD's, posters and other music merchandise, from black metal to punk,\
  \ hardcore to rock and other genres. This place is heaven for the black metal fans.\
  \ \n\nBefore getting to the basement, I try to talk to the owner. I did a little\
  \ interview with Grete, The owner. At first, she was doubt in talking to me as Norway\
  \ has a long history of church burning and it is still a sensitive topic for them,\
  \ but then, we get a quite long conversation about the black metal history and what\
  \ was happened to the store before and after she and her husband took over the place.\
  \ Grete was a very nice woman, and she told me that almost everyone who came, never\
  \ bother to have conversation with them. Most of them just look around, taking pictures\
  \ and sometimes buy some merchandise. I am the only one guest who literally made\
  \ a conversation with her as a visitor but then we just exchange contacts and followed\
  \ each other IG's. Until now, we still connected through IG. \n\nIn the basement\
  \ of this store, lies a historical room that was still original from the first time\
  \ the building was made. There was even a wall with BLACK METAL written in one side\
  \ and some dry blood on it that was kept original. This room has it's own attractiveness\
  \ for metal heads all over the world. The room was quite dark as it is in the dungeon,\
  \ and it really gave me goose bumps. So many people came far away to this place\
  \ just to see the wall, Feel the ambiance of the historical site. Coming here is\
  \ like being legitimately metal head.\n\nWhat amazed me was that over 30 years,\
  \ they still keep an original wall to keep the memory of the legendary band, and\
  \ how they preserved history. It was a once in a life time chance that no money\
  \ can buy."
