Text: '"Which will be our first place?" asked my older sister. It was real, we had
  already bought the one way ticket to Europe, but where we wanted to go? We knew
  we had some common grounds, like London, but where else? The Plan was 1 year in
  Europe, me and my sisters doing whatever you do when you go to a place you don''t
  know anyone, and don''t speak a word in their language thirty days at a time. "I
  don''t know!" I answered, just grab a map and give it a try randomly. One sister
  closed her eyes, the other moved the paper and that was how got to go to Toulouse.
  I don''t know if I believe in coincidence, or in the universe doing some little
  magics on our lives, but either way we appreciate whoever was responsible for that
  choice. One less thing to worry about, we then start the, some times fun, some times
  exasperating, part of researching and planning our first month by ourselves, in
  a different language, in a different country, in a different continent. "Oh! this
  is a good place to stay!" said my younger sister, "it has cats and we are going
  to miss our six cats while we are away, this way will less of a blow". We bought
  it. I mean, there were to cats in the house, how could it ever go wrong with people
  who have cats? Everything done? Yes! Some may say that we were unprepared, we thought
  we were just enough prepared to let life get in your one year away the way it preferred:
  unexpectedly and soundly.

  Ok, Toulouse, one month decided... eleven more to go!'
