Text: "I met someone online. No, I didn\u2019t swipe right, instead, I asked, \u201C\
  Is this available?\u201D\n\nI just arrived at Aotea Square, a pocket of calm and\
  \ breeze in Auckland\u2019s City Centre. On some days, the open-air plaza brims\
  \ with life, color, and music as people gather to join festivities and protests.\
  \ But on most days, like today, locals catch up over a takeaway flat white or some\
  \ snacks (while remaining unbothered by hungry, feisty pigeons). An acquired skill.\n\
  \nMy agenda for this afternoon: none of the above. I am meeting Jyothi, the seller\
  \ of the bike I saw online. She had me at \u201CSlightly Used Women\u2019s Road\
  \ Bicycle, Assembled by Experts from Retailer.\u201D A used car is ideal for my\
  \ year-long travel in New Zealand. But I can only afford two wheels, for now, so\
  \ I clicked the ad.\n\nAs I waited under the puddle of sunlight, I stared at the\
  \ glitter-like particles on the square\u2019s cemented floor. Not sure if I\u2019\
  m the only one taking notice, but is there a word for that? \n\nIt didn\u2019t take\
  \ long to spot a lady walking an aquamarine bike. We made eye contact and exchanged\
  \ smiles. It must be a buyer-seller instinct. After introductions and some small\
  \ talk about the weather, I inspected the bike. Smooth ride, screech-less brakes,\
  \ minor scratches \u2014 it\u2019s all good. Before handing the cash, I asked what\
  \ was her reason for selling, an unwritten rule of buying anything second-hand.\
  \ \n\n\u201CI need extra funds so I could visit home soon.\u201D Tranced into my\
  \ thoughts, two words struck me: visit and home. \n\nJyothi is a migrant from India\
  \ working at a university in Auckland. She has not seen her family for 5 years.\
  \ Leaving home in exchange for a comfortable life is not an entirely new concept\
  \ to me as a Filipino woman. And so we talked some more. I have a vivid memory of\
  \ her deep-set eyes, looking straight at me but feels like it\u2019s not here \u2014\
  \ longing. As she continues to talk about home, a contentious yet sentimental topic,\
  \ I felt a weight on my chest. \n\nTo dream meant missing her son\u2019s milestones.\n\
  To provide meant constant departures.\nTo succeed meant she can only visit home.\n\
  \nI wish I could fill the world with opportunities, until our homes will be kinder\
  \ to our dreams, until we won\u2019t find reasons to leave through its good and\
  \ bad and ugly.\n\nJyothi and I shared a warm handshake and parted ways. I went\
  \ on and pedaled home. My reflection from a shop window suggested that my bike is\
  \ too bright for my liking. Nonetheless, I bring with me a new ride, a new friend,\
  \ and a new hope for those yearning to be home soon."
