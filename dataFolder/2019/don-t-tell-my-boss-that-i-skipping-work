Text: '2018 is the most tiring year that i''ve ever done. i got a new boss and he
  made me and my collagues work like a horse. so, when lunch time i surfing into travel
  agent website and bought tickets to Bali, the place that i''ve never visited before.
  and i''m doin something that i don''t know if i can do it: solo traveling


  to the place that i''ve never visited before and doin solo traveling? why not!

  i''m preparing all the needs, write down an itinerary, contact the hotel and car
  rent in bali, thanks to google!


  when the date comes, i tell my boss that i can''t go to work because of flu. i skipping
  work about 7 days, and he didn''t know until now that i at vacation that day


  when i''m arrived at bali, i was alone. call an uber to drove me to the hotel. grab
  a hotel''s snack, and about 9pm i go to the local gay bar. yes, gay bar. i didn''t
  know that place exist until i found it in bali. i sat there, ordered a drink, and
  meet new friends in there. we have a chit chat and we enjoying our time. gosh, i''ve
  never done this before! i was so exciting!


  Traveling is opening new door into my life. Whenever i feel stressed over work,
  i''m booking a hotel and plane ticket right away. without telling my boss i''m planning
  a vacation of course

  and i''m doin it alone. i love solo traveling. it helped you find your own strength.

  so now, i''m addicted to travelling. oh and please don''t tell my boss that i lie
  to him :)'
