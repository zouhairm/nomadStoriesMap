Text: "In a world different from my own, I saw something pure.\n\nI had been a city\
  \ girl all my life, with everything surrounded me being so advanced, I knew little\
  \ of what it was like living in a rather poor and developing country. \n\nGot off\
  \ the plane, I was in a small, but the biggest airport of the country, I knew then,\
  \ that I had landed in Sri Lanka, a country that I had little knowledge of. I knew\
  \ that it\u2019s a Buddhism country, most famous of their black tea, however, I\
  \ can\u2019t honestly say that I knew anything beyond that.\n\nIt was the summer\
  \ of 2016, embarked my journey of one month in the pearl island next to India. I\
  \ couldn\u2019t speak Sinhala, one of the official languages of Sri Lanka, however,\
  \ the country was under the rule of the British until 1948, most Sri Lankan speaks\
  \ English, which, is also one of the country\u2019s official language besides Sinhala\
  \ and Tamil. In spite of this, I often found myself having trouble understanding\
  \ their accents. \n\nIn a month\u2019s time, I got to do some volunteer\u2019s work\
  \ and traveled around the country. I went to a group home, an orphanage, some would\
  \ say, where girls under the age of 18 without a home live, some have never seen\
  \ their parents, and some were removed from their homes due to child negligence\
  \ or abuses. A lot of the girls have gone through what I couldn\u2019t even imagine,\
  \ but the smile on their faces when I entered the room, made me forget just that.\
  \ They were extremely excited, and curious, to see foreign faces. A girl about the\
  \ age of 4, ran towards me and said \u201Cblue!\u201D, I realized that I was wearing\
  \ a blue shirt. \u201CYellow.\u201D, I said, pointed at hers, she laughed. Within\
  \ a minute\u2019s time, I was surrounded by girls from the age of three to ten,\
  \ shouting out all the English words they knew. \n\nThe following days, a group\
  \ of friends that I met in the country, would go to the group home and teach the\
  \ girls English and arts. Every time that we entered the room, it was the same excitement.\
  \ There\u2019s no televisions nor internet in the group home, and the girls have\
  \ just enough clothes to live by. They learned to cook and took care of themselves,\
  \ some too little, too soon, and their highlight of the day, was when some strangers\
  \ walked into their space. They don\u2019t need phones nor YouTube videos, for a\
  \ piece of paper and some markers would make their day. \n\nOn our last day there,\
  \ as we said our goodbyes, some girls ran towards me and handed me some cards they\
  \ made. In the cards, there\u2019s some drawings of me along with my name, my heart\
  \ was full. We walked out and they chased after us, until they stopped and shouted\
  \ \u201Cgoodbye.\u201D, and we kept walking. None of us could turn around, for we\
  \ knew that the tears would start bursting out if we did so.\n\nI had many adventures\
  \ in the country, and I had been to many places to experience its culture, history\
  \ and food. I did a cliff jumping, went rafting, climbed to the top of Pidurangala\
  \ Rock and even got into an argument or two with locals, but none of those would\
  \ beat what I experienced with those girls. They don\u2019t have anything, yet they\
  \ have everything, and that\u2019s the purest of pure, and that\u2019s something\
  \ that will live with me for the rest of my life."
