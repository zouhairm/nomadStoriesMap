Text: "Last year I decided to do something completely new for me, and honestly quite\
  \ scary: travelling alone. At the end of August I packed all my essential stuff\
  \ and I took, all by myself, a plane to Kuopio, a small town in the Eastern region\
  \ of Finland. This amazing city would have been my new home for the next three months.\
  \ \nI've found this country complitely different from all the other I've ever visited,\
  \ there is an athmosphere of calm and serenity wherever you are and you feel immidetly\
  \ at ease. People are nice and kind, and you know you can trust them and ask for\
  \ help if you need, but also, of course, as the sterotype teaches, they are quite\
  \ private and silently. The nature, though, is spectacular. Everywhere you turn\
  \ there are woods and lakes and at every corner a hot sauna to warm you up from\
  \ the cold weather. The most relaxing thing you can do is just start walking through\
  \ the trees and anjoy the cold sun and the silence of the nature, you can be sure\
  \ that wherever you will end up there will be a stunning view. \nClose to where\
  \ I lived there was the Koli National Park, where, if you are lucky enough you can\
  \ see bears and wolves. I wasn't that lucky unfortunately, but I enjoyed a lot canoing\
  \ in the lake and exploring the numerous remotly islands. \nAt the end of October\
  \ the surrondings start to change. It starts to snow and everything begin to be\
  \ white and frozen. You can walk on a frozen lake, or skate on it and go cross-country\
  \ skiing. \nBut the real cold you find in Lapland, the northern region of Finland\
  \ where meters of snow cover everything and where reindeers cross the roads careless.\
  \ Here, in Rovaniemi, there is the \"real\" village of Santa Clause, ice igloo and\
  \ christmasy air all year long. \nHowever, the most amazing thing you can see in\
  \ FInland are the Northern Lights, an amazing natural phenomenon that will leave\
  \ you speachless. There are litteraly no word to describe how you feel the first\
  \ time you see those green lights dancing in the dark sky. It just make you want\
  \ to live there forever and watch them, forever.\nOf course FInland is not a country\
  \ for everyone, it's freezing, it's silent, is snowy for half of the year, it's\
  \ dark (very dark, too dark) during winter, and annoingly bright during summer,\
  \ there are few people and a lot of nature, but take it from somone that love warm,\
  \ sunny weather and hates grey sky, you will not regreat travel in FInland, not\
  \ even one second, not even when at 3 in the afternoon will be already dark, because\
  \ despite those flaws, this country will always surprise you, make you feel safe\
  \ and offer you wondeful scenarios."
