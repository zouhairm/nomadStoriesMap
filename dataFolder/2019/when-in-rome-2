Text: "A LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN\n\n\nKinosaki, Japan.\n\nWe arrived early in the day\
  \ via train. A small, ancient village in the mountains. Apparently founded 700 years\
  \ ago - a Buddhist monastery was established there among a valley of natural hot\
  \ springs and had become a popular holiday destination.\n\nAt 10.30 in Kinosaki\
  \ not much was happening. The village was quiet. We found a traditional Ryokan -\
  \ a treat for us on a budget - and the hostess asked us if we wanted a \u2018traditional\
  \ room\u2019. Yes please!  The room was furnished with tatami mats and a futon bed.\
  \ Hanging in the wardrobe were two matching kimono sets, his and hers, with traditional\
  \ clogs and - untraditional - lanyards.\n\nThrough gestures our host suggested we\
  \ dress in these to go to the hot pools. K? Um, how ridiculous. We look out on the\
  \ narrow streets and saw normally dressed Japanese going about their normal business.\
  \ No clogs in sight.\n\nIn conservative, and knowing, european fashion we slung\
  \ our togs and towels over our arms and walked to the nearest onsen, happily holding\
  \ the lanyard, which gave us free access to 8 local pools. It seems early, there\
  \ are not many people around. \n\nThe village is gorgeous. A small creek runs through\
  \ the middle. The path alongside is lined with flowering cherry blossoms and pink\
  \ and purple lanterns. Ancient stone bridges cross it and school girls in navy blue\
  \ and white uniforms hold brightly coloured umbrellas. Old ladies dry tiny fish\
  \ by their front doors.\n\nThe pools are set amongst beautifully landscaped entrances\
  \ with stone and wooden posts. We enter one and show our lanyard. We take off our\
  \ shoes and place them in the lockers, the pools are empty but for us. \n\nI shower\
  \ well, the pools are segregated, but I wear my togs anyway.  As I get out  - in\
  \ my togs, which I am now glad of - a group of laughing Japanese women come in.\
  \ They look at me and titter. I go and change back into my clothes.\n\nWe meet back\
  \ out the front and wander through the town admiring an ancient moss garden. The\
  \ moss covers buddhas and other statues. The whole village has a feel of ancient\
  \ ruins. At the end of the street we catch a cable car up the hill to the monastery.\n\
  \nAs we go up the mountain we float over a large cemetery. Acres and acres of neatly\
  \ laid grey and white tombstones. So many for such a small town. Up high in the\
  \ cable car we can look down the valley and out to sea. The monastery is perched\
  \ on a steep hillside amongst huge trees. The buildings are quiet and dusty - in\
  \ the dark cool, small candles light up red and gold effigies and alters. Giant\
  \ logs have been used to support the walls and roofs. It is still, a real sanctuary.\
  \ Amazing that the monastery  stands all those years as many have been burnt in\
  \ fires.  We stand next to a large white buddha and look down the valley, in awe\
  \ of the ancientness of Japan, coming from the relatively young country of New Zealand.\n\
  \nA small group of young school children and their teacher walk quietly amongst\
  \ the buildings, and occasionally we glimpse the back of a brown robed monk. No\
  \ other people. Away from the madding crowds.\n\nIt\u2019s now about 4.30. And the\
  \ streets are full of people. We stroll back to our ryokan. We begin to notice people\
  \ walking in pairs. We know they are pairs as they are dressed the same. Identical\
  \ kimonos, identical wee baskets and those wooden, ancient clogs. They stroll along\
  \ the cobbled streets. They are workers, arrived from the cities, for a relaxing\
  \ weekend in the village of Kinosaki - the Onsen village.\n\nBack home our host\
  \ gives us a knowing look. We sheepishly go upstairs and examine the traditional\
  \ clothes. Really\u2026 no underwear\u2026wrapped up. Well actually it feels very\
  \ safe, like being wrapped in a coupled of well tied duvets. We look ridiculous,\
  \ but, perhaps - stately? We go the whole hog - exchanging sneakers for clogs. Cautiously\
  \ step out into the tide of people. We are swept up in the relaxed happy atmosphere.\
  \ We are all walking around this village, naked, under our kimonos. We clunk along\
  \ to the nearest hot pool.\n\nNow we are with it. Place our clogs amongst the others.\
  \ Walk barefoot to the changing rooms. They are full. Splashing, laughing, cleansing\
  \ completely naked, beautiful Japanese women. Masses of shampoo, soap, body washes,\
  \ soaping and scrubbing. Exfoliating. Brown, smooth, skin. They are completely at\
  \ ease. They slide into the pools like sleek seals.\n\nMy image of my own self is\
  \ somewhat less poetic. But I manage a nude entry and keep my shoulders well under\
  \ the water. Not exactly a leap, more of a plunge into the unknown .\n\nI hear the\
  \ men in the onsen next door. They are quietly laughing. My husband is bald. And\
  \ white. And below the ears, very very hairy. He doesn\u2019t speak Japanese. But\
  \ he\u2019s an expert at sign and grunt language. I hear the mating call of the\
  \ silver backed gorilla and a large amount of joviality through at the mens\u2019\
  \ pool.\n\nI explain to the curious women in my pool that we are here on honeymoon.\
  \ They laugh and politely (sort of) ask my age. I realise at 45 I\u2019m not exactly\
  \ a child bride, but still.. And then one points to her mother, a quiet, round faced\
  \ woman with sparkly eyes. She is 87! I am amongst octogenarians and their retired\
  \ daughters. Most of them 60 year olds. They are gorgeous! \n\nAfter a relaxing\
  \ soak I stroll out of the pool, happily splashing under the shower using up the\
  \ wee bottles of Shiseido -like the great white whale I am, feeling strangely at\
  \ peace with the world. \n\nWe meet out the front of the onsen. Without saying a\
  \ word we clunk off - stately like - to the next hot pool, knowing we leave in our\
  \ wake a gentle amusement and entertainment. We feel part Japanese, but completely\
  \ Kiwi."
