Text: "It was just before Liege when I realised how long I had been away. You enter\
  \ a tunnel in Germany and when you come out you are in Southern Belgium and it is\
  \ a lovely place, forest on one side, the pretty town of Gemmenich on the other.\
  \ But after Italy, Austria and Germany I had overdosed on scenery, I needed something\
  \ else and Belgian place names gave me that. As we approached Liege the train passed\
  \ a small station called Angleur and on the river alongside the track was a man\
  \ fishing, an Angler. Mildly diverting for most people but to me it was hilarious\
  \ an angler in Angleur. I was still laughing to myself when we arrived in Liege.\n\
  The station at Liege was the most modern I had been in, it looked great it was similar\
  \ in shape to the aquatic centre at the London Olympics. I do tend to judge places\
  \ on first impressions and Liege impressed me beyond measure, it did have two problems\
  \ though, the graffiti, obviously Europe really does have a problem with it in general.\
  \ But the other one surprised me, in a station that looked as if it was built the\
  \ day before, the escalators where the slowest I have ever seen. The designer had\
  \ obviously set the speed so everybody could admire his work.\nThe train terminated\
  \ at Brussels, a city that is the nominal capital of Europe and to be honest is\
  \ a quite ugly place. I could not shake the feeling though that Brussels was the\
  \ centre of so much in Europe so couldn't they make it a bit less of a dump.\nWe\
  \ had to catch our first really local train of the trip, from Brussels we were going\
  \ to Mouscron and there would change to a French train for the 20 kilometre journey\
  \ to Lille. The train left and made its way through Western Belgium stopping every\
  \ ten minutes or so at some pleasant little town, now in my tired state I didn\u2019\
  t think anything could be as funny as an angler in Angleur but then we stopped at\
  \ Silly, this amused me gently but the next station was called Ath, which I automatically\
  \ changed in my tired mind to Ass, oh how I laughed, Western Belgium for me will\
  \ always be known as Silly Ass from now on.\n  To add to my level of hilarity I\
  \ had found a leaflet on the train for a series of theme parks in Belgium, a sort\
  \ of Belgian Disney World if you will. Every country has theme parks I suppose,\
  \ but along with towns named after sedate riverbank pursuits and neighbouring communities\
  \ called Silly Ass, they couldn't name their theme parks funland or something, they\
  \ called theirs.\nPlopsaland\nPlopsaqua\nPlopsa Indoor\nPlopsa coo\nVisiting a theme\
  \ park named after poo is bad enough but a swimming pool as well. As for Plopsa\
  \ indoor it is a pretty much basic requirement of mine that all my Plopsa\u2019\
  s are done indoors, in fact I will go even further and say not just indoors but\
  \ in a toilet and while we are on the subject of Plopsa\u2019s what is a Plopsa\
  \ coo.\nThe train reached Mouscron and it was a small dusty little place. We made\
  \ the connection to Lille our second local train of the entire trip, it was only\
  \ 20 minutes so I couldn't count it really. I enjoyed the slower pace, you saw more\
  \ of the country and it was more in keeping with what I was expecting from the trip.\
  \ You need to find a balance between speed and enjoyment and in Belgium I think\
  \ I did."
