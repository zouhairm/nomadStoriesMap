Text: "\u201CNothing brings people together like a hot cup of something in the middle\
  \ of nowhere\u201D\n\nAfter a tiring five hours on the road, we turned our engines\
  \ off and tore off our gloves. My hands were freezing. We had been on the bumpy\
  \ road since 6AM that morning, it was so incredibly cold in Sikkim. Outside a momo\
  \ shop, I found a stack of dirty plastic chairs, I took one down for myself and\
  \ set up near a tea vendor, while the others walked into Sejal\u2019s homemade momos.\
  \ \n\n\u201CBhaiya, one chai please\u201D, I said to the old man who stood behind\
  \ a counter that had two nearly-overflowing pots - one with milk and one with tea.\
  \ He was fidgeting with something under the counter before his head popped up, only\
  \ enough for me to see him - \n\u201CJi\u201D \nHe pulled out a fresh bottle of\
  \ water and handed it to me from his hiding, \u201Cdrink this, the cold fools you\
  \ into thinking you are not thirsty. That\u2019s why most tourists fall ill here\u201D\
  \ \n\nI smiled at the sweet man and took a sip. He was right, I didn\u2019t realise\
  \ how much I had needed it! \n\nI stretch my legs out in front of me, undo my helmet\
  \ hair and let the wind pass through me, through the exhaustion. As I wait for my\
  \ tea, I watch the mountains across me, how still they were, how slow time moved\
  \ up in the mountains.. \nThe  grey colour palette of Sikkim was one like no other,\
  \ it doesn\u2019t seem gloomy, rather refreshing and light. Maybe that\u2019s what\
  \ everything in this state is like - just somehow better up here than there in the\
  \ cities. \n\n\u201CMadam? Chai?\u201D he smiled as he stretched out one fraile\
  \ arm, his hand cupping a steel glass from the bottom. I snap out of my mountainous\
  \ dream and jump to help the old man, \u201Cthat must be extremely hot!\u201D \n\
  He made sure I had a strong enough grip of the glass before completely letting go,\
  \ \u201CYes but it\u2019s also very cold here.\u201D \n\nI don\u2019t know whether\
  \ it\u2019s Sikkim\u2019s blanket of comfort or the tea but there\u2019s an old\
  \ man in the grey mountains named Kashish, who has a well wisher from a grey city."
