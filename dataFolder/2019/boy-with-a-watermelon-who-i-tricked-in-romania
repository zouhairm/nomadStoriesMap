Text: "Being a tourist is not always a privilege. Being a tourist means being a stranger\
  \ and strangers are not always welcome. Therefore, while traveling, I search to\
  \ become a local or, at least, to feel and look like a local. \n\nWhen I think about\
  \ my most memorable local connection, I recall my first trip to Romania. I should\
  \ mention here that I speak Romanian and when I first came to this country, I had\
  \ already been intensively learning it for two years. \n\nWe arrived in the town\
  \ of Sinaia with a big group of Russian tourists after a long bus ride from Bulgaria.\
  \ I had managed to make a \"friend\" on the bus. In her fifties, she was a former\
  \ school teacher who, after having retired, traveled alone sharing her life stories\
  \ with her travel companions.\n\nUpon our arrival in Sinaia, I felt the need to\
  \ escape from my compatriots. I told my new \"friend\" that I wanted to stay at\
  \ the hotel and get some rest (it was a pious lie). Once she left with a few other\
  \ ladies from the group, I also went to explore the surroundings. \n\nSinaia is\
  \ a small town that attracts more tourists in winter than in summer because of its\
  \ skiing resort. In summer, it serves as a halt for those who travel between castles\
  \ hidden in Romanian forests. There is also an orthodox monastery unusual for Russian\
  \ tourists accustomed with golden domes of Russian churches. \n\nI was wandering\
  \ down one of a few central streets, stopping from time to time by empty souvenir\
  \ shops. It was quite boring and I thought of going back to the hotel to watch TV.\
  \ \n\nBut suddenly my loneliness was disrupted by an unordinary passer-by. A boy,\
  \ a few years younger than me, coming up the street with a watermelon on his shoulder.\
  \ A character from another era. With his disheveled blond hair, he reminded me of\
  \ a 1970s Romanian TV series \"Pistruiatul\" (\"Freckled boy\" in Romanian) that\
  \ we watched during our Romanian classes at the university.\n\nHe was an alien among\
  \ other people in the street. I thought that all the Romanians were dark-haired\
  \ but this one looked like a blond-haired angel.\nSuddenly, he came up to me. \n\
  \nWhat time is it? \u2013 he asked me in Romanian. \n\nI understood the question\
  \ but my knowledge of Romanian faded away. I was so embarrassed. There were other\
  \ people in the street but he came to me with this \"embarrassing\" question. \n\
  \nStill searching for necessary words, I took my phone from the pocket. \n\nHalf\u2026\
  \ past\u2026 six \u2013 murmured I finally. Every word was like a stroke of a hammer.\n\
  \nThanks, - he replied and disappeared. \n\nI stayed open-mouthed for some time.\
  \ He was the first Romanian in Romania who talked to me. It was like a recognition.\
  \  He seemed to be sure that I knew Romanian. And fortunately, I managed to reply.\
  \  \n\nBut then I realized that I made a mistake. No, my Romanian was correct. But\
  \ the time was wrong. I absolutely forgot that I had Russian time on my phone that\
  \ is one hour in advance. \n\nI was so disappointed that I called my parents to\
  \ tell them the story about a \"Boy with a Watermelon Who I Tricked in Romania\"\
  . \n\nI still recall this story sometimes even if I had deeper local connections\
  \ in Romania. For me, such weak fleeting connections make memories stronger.  One\
  \ question, one smile, one look can be enough to make you feel more than an ordinary\
  \ tourist."
