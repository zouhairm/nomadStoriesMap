Text: "A journey within\n\tThe scorching heat was making me queasy and dizzy, the\
  \ constant poring of sweat running down my face and body was extremely annoying\
  \ and it added to my already bad mood. People seemed so distant and superficial,\
  \ all smiles and no sweet creamy filling inside. I was empty and was carrying around\
  \ a big hole in my chest. I was desperate for a change. I needed one. I wanted someplace\
  \ else, some place colder in climate and yet warmer in affection. I just could not\
  \ live like that any longer. \n\tSo I left, I took a step into the unknown desperately\
  \ searching for a new connection that would make me find something unexpected. I\
  \ traveled to a distant continent, and what was supposed to be a six-month trip\
  \ turned into six years of new discoveries and fresh beginnings. \n\tI spent some\
  \ time in the land down under and didn\u2019t find what I was looking for. Except\
  \ for beautiful beaches you cannot drink on. I tried Indonesia too, and although\
  \ I thought my life was better than most people\u2019s holiday, I wasn\u2019t fooled,\
  \ it was no real life, so I left as well. I then went to the land of the long white\
  \ cloud, and experienced some real-life shit for three years living inside a post\
  \ card, and yet I was still constantly feeling like my search was not complete.\
  \ I still craved something to fill that big painful void inside that kept me wandering\
  \ around in circles like a ballerina on top of a music box. \nThailand came next,\
  \ and Malasya right after. The hot weather, delicious street-food, giant Budas and\
  \ the spiritual good vibe did not catch me either. What was wrong with me? I often\
  \ wondered. What could possibly be missing that was so hard to find in all of those\
  \ amazing places? Why it was so hard to find? Why did I have more questions now\
  \ than I had before? Why? Why? Why? \n Then it happened. I had found love, a love\
  \ that would finally complete whatever was missing in me, and perhaps fill that\
  \ hole inside. It was no coincidence that he was from the land of love, and that\
  \ was also my next destiny. I was on the moon. Or so I thought. \nThe land of love,\
  \ that speaks the language of love and bakes very good bread and pastries, with\
  \ its delicious cheese and coq of vin, it was also the land of harsh immigration\
  \ laws and institutionalized racism, as it turned out. My blond prince soon became\
  \ a rude frog, and I fell from the moon with a bigger hole in my chest that the\
  \ one I had before. Dang! The world had spited me out like an old chewed gum. \n\
  The prodigal daughter returns to mum\u2019s nest. Wounded and bitter. And still\
  \ carrying that gigantic hole inside. The heat is still punishing us for something\
  \ I don\u2019t know of, people are still superficial, but now we have a dictatorship\
  \ revival to look forward to. Things could not be worst, right? \nThe forced return\
  \ home after six years of amazing travels, new cultures and expanded horizons made\
  \ me realize some things. After two years of reclusion, self-analysis and a change\
  \ of old habits I have found myself not craving for something else outside of myself\
  \ to fill this void inside. I think I am accepting it now. Understanding that maybe\
  \ we were all born with a void inside and our mission here is to find within whatever\
  \ we need to fulfill it. And that\u2019s the key word, within. It doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ how many beautiful amazing different countries we visit in a lifetime, if we are\
  \ going away expecting something outside of ourselves to fix us, to fill our hole,\
  \ to heal us, we will be disappointed. We won\u2019t find it. \nI never expected\
  \ to find myself in my travels. And yet I did. Every place, every person, every\
  \ experience I had during those six amazing years traveling the world helped me\
  \ get where I am today. In peace with myself, still learning and making mistakes,\
  \ yet in peace. The world introduced me to myself!"
