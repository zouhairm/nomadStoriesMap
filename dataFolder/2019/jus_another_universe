Text: "A travel blog has been in my bucket list for years now but starting a new blog\
  \ from scratch is a huge commitment. After much thought i have decided to go for\
  \ it and be a part of this learning experience. There are few things I'd like to\
  \ share about the places i have been. Lets start with Port Louis the capital of\
  \ Mauritius. The Caudan Waterfront is a lively dining and shopping precinct. Nearby,\
  \ vendors sell local produce and handicrafts at the huge Central Market. The Blue\
  \ Penny Museum focuses on the island\u2019s colonial and maritime history, along\
  \ with its culture. At Le Caudan Waterfront, one can meet friends for a drink, take\
  \ a walk along the harbour, watch the latest movie and indulge in some Games in\
  \ Casinos. Flic-en-Flac is a seaside town its public white sandy beach is one of\
  \ the longest on the island. Grand Bay in the north part of mauritius is the happening\
  \ place for weekend parties and the locals there do know how to spend the weekend.\
  \ The parties are on until the sunrise the next morning. MARE TABAC AND DAGOTIRE\
  \  is the place i stayed with the locals small town in the south of mauritius and\
  \ the drive from port louis to mare tabac and to dagotire is one of the best i have\
  \ driven in a very long time. the scenic mountains and the clear blue skies with\
  \ sugarcane fields on both sides one can imagine watching a movie while driving\
  \ thru those roads with music playing at the background. The closest beach to mare\
  \ tabac is the Blue Bay and the sunset there is the best place to be. The mountains\
  \ on the side of the beaches is natures beauty. While i sat down watching the sunset\
  \ there is hope in the air wind in my hair the mist of the sea transporting to another\
  \ world, mountains ,sea shores sunsetting  covering everything in its stead. the\
  \ view from the window mesmerizing enchanting eyes glued to the expanse imagination\
  \ taking over. time stands still nature is all thats there, breathing in the fresh\
  \ air  converting dreams to reality."
