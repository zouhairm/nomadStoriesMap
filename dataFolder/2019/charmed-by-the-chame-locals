Text: "After several hours of non-stop trekking we finally reach our checkpoint; Chame.\
  \ A small but popular stop for trekkers doing the Annapurna Circuit. \nMy guide\
  \ walks into the kitchen and immediately knows the owner of the guest house- 'Tilicho\
  \ Guest house' is a regular abode he takes his trekkers. The owner takes me to my\
  \ room upstairs while my guide settles downstairs. After I take my sweaty socks\
  \ off and get settled in I head back downstairs and catch my guide in their kitchen\
  \ sipping on some tea. I ask if I can join in. The owner and her mother are preparing\
  \ and cooking dinner for their other guests. Everyone there is speaking Nepali.\
  \ I don't understand a word of it but somehow I also do. I ask if I can taste some\
  \ of the food and what they are putting in- they oblige my curiosity. \nThe sun\
  \ started to set across the horizon. A beautiful magenta and vermillion shade blanketed\
  \ into the kitchen. The owner's father ran in and gestured at us to come watch.\
  \ The whole street was filled with locals and travellers- I could hear French, Nepali,\
  \ German. Everyone together. Gazing at the beautiful view in pure bliss. \nThis\
  \ for me is travelling. Immersion into culture. Eating and learning with the locals.\
  \ One of the most beautiful experiences for me when travelling Nepal was trekking\
  \ with a local guide and suddenly being able to understand the Nepali language even\
  \ though I couldn't speak a word of it. I was suddenly able to understand a different\
  \ culture, I didn't feel foreign anymore. Culture is important when travelling to\
  \ a different country. Not only for the traveller but for the locals- it is a sign\
  \ of respect and openness to want to learn about the ways of a different country."
