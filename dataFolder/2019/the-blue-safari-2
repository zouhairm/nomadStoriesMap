Text: "The Blue Safari. \n\nThere\u2019s no denying that the spice islands of East\
  \ Africa conjure up imagery centered on the quintessential island dream. In fact\
  \ \u2013 I bet it\u2019s something you\u2019ve already been angling for over the\
  \ last few weeks, slogging away as the 2019 calendar unfolds; flipped-over and forgotten.\
  \ \n\nAs an island holiday destination goes, it ticks all the boxes; warm waters,\
  \ a climate that ensures I\u2019ll come back with a tan and lastly, as a South African\
  \ traveling with \u2018Randelas\u2019 in your back pocket, there\u2019s a whole\
  \ lot more bang for your buck.\n\nWhilst we\u2019re island dreaming, let\u2019s\
  \ also throw in some of the other visuals that complete this tropical montage\u2026\
  \ how about seemingly never-ending seafood buffets, sunsets that are only welcomed\
  \ in with your help and a cold beverage of choice, complete with a flamboyant fruit/umbrella\
  \ decoration on the side for a little extra pizzazz. Sand in toes, sun-kissed shoulders\
  \ and an average outdoor temperature that ensures the changes between costume and\
  \ cover-up are as fluid as the last swirl of your ice-cold sundowner.\n\nIf the\
  \ above imagery does not get you wanting to book flights, then I fear there may\
  \ be something (seriously) wrong with you. An island holiday may sounds idyllic\
  \ to most of us, but the question always remains the \u2018where\u2019.  Let\u2019\
  s face it- these days, thanks to us being the most inter-connected generation and\
  \ all, we can travel to any point on the world map, in a moment, with a click to\
  \ see a street view or do a quick palm tree tally and so the question remains...what\
  \ makes Zanzibar stand out as the shining star in this fiercely competitive 21st\
  \ century line up?\n\nFor me the answer lies in the authenticity behind this place\
  \ and the immense generosity of spirit shining out through our local hosts, with\
  \ a veracity equivalent to a midday African sun casting its beams on all those who\
  \ pass by. Call me millennial but it\u2019s also because I truly believe that travel\
  \ at some form should challenge you; there are places out there that may take an\
  \ eight hour flight to reach but where the experience transcends all that you know.\
  \ The familiar made all the sweeter thanks to the priveledge of feeling small.\n\
  \nWinding lanes in the historic trade centre of Stone Town are made all the more-intriguing\
  \ due to the exotic blend of the Swahili and Islamic influences. 19th Century landmarks\
  \ and beautiful carved doors abound at every corner. This blend of culture and \u2018\
  chill\u2019 are part of what makes Zanzibar so unique in its tourism offering. If\
  \ you need any more reasons to find it interesting, perhaps the fact that it had\
  \ the shortest war in history, lasting approximately 45 minutes,  that it was also\
  \ the first country in Africa to offer colour television, or was the birth place\
  \ of Queen front man, Freddy Mercury, may add to the intrigue. \n\nWalking the long\
  \ stretches of beach that run between some of the neighbouring hotels and lodges\
  \ of the East coast mean you\u2019re guaranteed to make friends\u2026and fast. Once\
  \ I\u2019d bought more than my baggage allowance of African art and all the cloves,\
  \ nutmeg, cinnamon and black pepper I could carry, these new friends relinquished\
  \ their salesmen roles and instead were happy to swap bartering with early morning\
  \ discussions of SA politics, laughingly delivering more jokes than Trevor Noah\
  \ on \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 and showing an eagerness to learn more about things\
  \ beyond their borders, that was as genuine as the smiles we shared.\n\n\nOne of\
  \ my most special travel memories to date was a \u2018blue dhow safari\u2019 that\
  \ I got bullied into booking on the last day of my East African adventures (by someone\
  \ half my age, I may add).\n\nWhat started as an early-morning on the beach transpired\
  \ into the best day of hunting down every blue hue you can imagine, finding only\
  \ locally known spots- far past \u2018pin drops\u2019 on the global map- we explored\
  \ the secret treasures of Zanibar and when the sun threatened its last goodbye,\
  \ like good Africans who know the power of a shared fire, we braaied together on\
  \ the beach."
