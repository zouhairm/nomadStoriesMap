Text: "Our plan is to witness the meteor shower from the beach. I\u2019ve never seen\
  \ one before, and so I\u2019m more excited than her about it; my smile gives me\
  \ away, as my ever-growing stream of words and my uneasy eyes, regularly inspecting\
  \ the sky to catch the first lights. There are almost no cars on the road. Carrying\
  \ my mobile in my hand, google map\u2019s voice keeps on strongly advising to turn\
  \ right on the second exit, 600 meters ahead. After echoing the order to Joana,\
  \ I try to get her attention and ask if she\u2019d ever seen a shooting star. No,\
  \ she says, more like on auto-pilot than actively submerging in her memory. So I\
  \ tell her about that time when having a smoke on my house\u2019s rooftop, a light\
  \ stroke through the night. I wished on it, but clearly nothing happened. The wishes\
  \ we make are delayed, because that light actually appeared some time before, I\
  \ say. Huh, I knew that, she says, and turns right on the third exit. It is an odd\
  \ four-way roundabout, really. Cars come from all sides and one must gradually slow\
  \ down to avoid a crash. We find a way back and this time take the right exit. A\
  \ drizzle lightly taps the windshield. Really?, I think out loud, rolling down the\
  \ window to feel with a hand. Is it raining?, she asks. As I put my hand back from\
  \ the open, water has fully covered the windshield, so Joana turns on the wipers.\
  \ It can\u2019t be, I say while rolling the window back up. Through the last-second\
  \ slit, cold air sneaks in the car messing with the papers sitting on the back.\
  \ You bet it can, she says, squinting through the foggy glass. Could you clean that\
  \ up?, she says. No rag in sight, so I use my bare palm; now it\u2019s humid, a\
  \ bit. I can see the road through my prints, like marks for mercy, oh! god have\
  \ some mercy on us and stop this rain. I slightly open the window to defog the inside\
  \ of the car and ourselves from this bad luck. All through the week, I say, Sun\u2019\
  s been unbearable, even! But today\u2026 I stop. Up above, a thick grey cloud is\
  \ fully covering the perseidic dance. Google\u2019s voice announces satisfied that\
  \ we\u2019ve reached our destination. On top of a beach dune there\u2019s a shack\
  \ with its lights on. We\u2019re engulfed by the fog: god is not listening. Angry,\
  \ helpless, I close my eyes. Joana\u2019s laugh cuts through the damp air and I\
  \ open them back again: there\u2019s nothing but fog and the distant sound of the\
  \ sea. Such a strange place, she says; she\u2019s a bit afraid. Indeed, we notice\
  \ voices and music coming from the shack, framed by a red light moving like a pendulum,\
  \ as if a ritual was happening. Behind us, kids\u2019 laughs come and go. On the\
  \ stairs leading to the shack there\u2019s a sign requesting us not to litter; mind\
  \ the dunes and the plants, it says. Good evening, we say as we climb up the stairs,\
  \ but no one answers. There are no stars here, Joana says, we should turn back.\
  \ She\u2019s right: there\u2019s only that thick cloud; an overwhelming cloak. Feels\
  \ like we were walking through a dream, I say. I thought the same, she says: maybe\
  \ we are sharing a dream, each lying on our own beds, reaching to the stars to wake\
  \ up. And so we turn back. There\u2019s no one on top of the dune, as if they had\
  \ disappeared, but the red light is still on. Inside her car we look back at it;\
  \ the music sounds muffled. Rain has gone and the fog is slowly dissipating. Joana\
  \ is staring at me and then stretches her arm in front of my face, pointing beyond\
  \ my humid window. See that black cat on that tree over there?, she asks. So I turn\
  \ my head right, looking for it. I can\u2019t find it, only a few huge trees and\
  \ the scattered lights of houses far from us."
