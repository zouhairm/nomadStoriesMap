Text: "A real day in Paris, chez Miznon.\n\nI could look the sky from the flat of\
  \ the second arrondissement in Paris where I spent my two last nights, so kindly\
  \ received by a modern charming prince, a French guy. \nIt was covered and cloudy\
  \ as you can except it, once down in the street we actually understood that those\
  \ tiny rainy drops were also there and kept us company for long hours. \nPassing\
  \ just under the house where Colette lived for decades until her death, you can\
  \ arrive at the Palais Royal\u2019s park. I could admire for the first time those\
  \ light sea green chairs all around the fountain and also spread with the trees\
  \ all around the park, and actual readers occupied them, turning their pages without\
  \ knowing to be part of the most perfect painting. It was the scene of the most\
  \ real French film, those seen with the light turned off keeping the screen just\
  \ near to you. \nIt wasn\u2019t the first time for me in Paris, I had already crossed\
  \ the Louvre and went on and off the Parisian\u2019s bridges, but our direction\
  \ was another one, or better his direction was another one, le Marais. \nWe\u2019\
  re headed there to eat, that was the main raison. My guide was a travel lover, any\
  \ part of his apartment was a piece of the roads that he\u2019d joined. \nThe idea\
  \ was to use Paris to travel together with just a few hours in our disposition,\
  \ travel through our sensations. Paris is filled with all these tiny airports called\
  \ bistros.\nLe Marais is an open kitchen, one of them when you can see the chef\
  \ choosing which sauce he\u2019s putting in that plate that you\u2019ve been dreaming\
  \ for long minutes, the flavor accompanies your steps, your envies decide where\
  \ to turn and where to stop. \nWhat forced me to stop was the beauty, the window\
  \ of Miznon made a strike on me. It was simple but filled with red mature tomatoes\
  \ just putted one upon the other staying there and hitting to who looked from the\
  \ other side of the glass, near to them another pile was made by cauliflower, the\
  \ real specialty of that street food restaurant. The green and white of the cauliflower\
  \ next to the red of the tomatoes where the perfect colors of an endless valley\
  \ with her thick grass filled with poppy\u2019s that my mind made me see. \nThe\
  \ decision was made, once the door was opened a whole universe was attending us.\
  \ A universe made by perfumes, flavors, music, colors, green herbs on the tables,\
  \ dancing cooks on their positions screaming loud that it was ready, and all was\
  \ served under a shy light all over the place. \nWe managed to find a table, everyone\
  \ who has visited at least once Paris has noticed their ability to eat in those\
  \ extremely tiny bistro\u2019s tables where all you need to eat and use for your\
  \ meal must enter perfectly in that extreme little space that you dispose, it\u2019\
  s a miracle which happens every time a meal is served, so it was for us.\nAt Miznon\
  \ eating was making love, every little slice was an explosion of flavor, it was\
  \ possible to hear every thought just reading the expressions on the faces of the\
  \ other lucky ones around us, the air was thick and tired filled with all the pleasure\
  \ released after each bite. \nOnce finished we left the table for the next Miznon\u2019\
  s lovers, we stepped out closing the door behind us leaving the dancing waiters\
  \ and the enchanted restaurant to keep on with his service.\nThe rain has stopped\
  \ but the clouds were still there, we left rue des Ecouffes and headed to Place\
  \ des Vosges."
