Text: "For someone who loves her bed , travelling more than two thousand kilometres\
  \ away from home, was a nightmare. Not a bad one but a really good one. My unexpected\
  \ beautiful journey of travelling from Delhi to Shillong.  Wonderstrucked by the\
  \ history of the tribes in Don Bosco Museum to leaving my footprints in Lady Hydari\
  \ park, to drowning myself in the noisy tranquillity of the falls in Cherrapunji\
  \ and carrying the Souvenirs back home.\nMy first blow came when I saw the exterior\
  \ of the Don Bosco Museum, made in hexagonal shape with seven storeys. There were\
  \ more than fifteen galleries which take you back to the roots of the people of\
  \ the seven sisters. Seven sisters include Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland,\
  \ Tripura, Assam, Manipur, and Mizoram. Be ready to not only add something to your\
  \ brain but also to your heart.\nShillong is said to be named after Lei Shillong.\
  \ He was the deity of the Khmer people who were the first ones to inhabit the place.\
  \  Christianity followers are a great part of the population. But what makes their\
  \ traditions unique from the others? The children take up their mothers\u2019 family\
  \ name and clan. The eldest brother is responsible for taking most of the family\
  \ decisions. There were many types of foods and jewellery which I have seen for\
  \ the first time, but there was one accessory which made me to stick my face to\
  \ the glass. It was a nose accessory which one wears inside the empty holes of the\
  \ nose, known as Bulaki. The story behind it was that a tribe used to have very\
  \ beautiful girls so tribals of other tribes used to steal their girls. To stop\
  \ this the tribe made every girl wear Bulaki  as it made the girls look ugly. Strange?\
  \ A local told me this story so there is hardly any proof of it, but I like it.\n\
  Now, let\u2019s talk about water. Why not? Cherrapunji is the Second Wettest Place\
  \ on Planet Earth. The rain might ruin your pretty little picnic but gifts you Lush\
  \ greenery, beautiful landscapes, and mystical waterfalls in abundance.  \n\nEnroute\
  \ to Mawsmai caves, we went to  the Nohsngithiang Falls, Cherrapunji,  a seven-segmented\
  \ waterfall . Below the falls there was a plunge pool with unusual green coloured\
  \ water.  I opened shoes and started jumping in the water. When I got wet to the\
  \ best I can, I sat on one of the rocks. The breeze cutt my face but the tranquillity\
  \ connected my insides. That was a moment of my life.\nWe reached Mawsmai caves\
  \ which are more than thirty kilometre long. This is the closest you can witness\
  \ the creations of nature, with well-lit way, in Meghalaya.\nThe magnificent natural\
  \ caves have innumerable forms, shapes and sizes inside, leaving one to imagine\
  \ as many life forms as possible, a handiwork of years of natural abrasion and underground\
  \ water.\nIn the heart of Shillong City lies this legendary Japanese style garden,\
  \ Lady Hydari Park. It is named after the first lady of Assam. Rather than relaxing\
  \ in the hotel bed, one can relax in this park while exploring the place. One can\
  \ see small kids from a school taking a walk around the garden with their teachers.\
  \ There is a mini zoo, where you can find the local animals.\nThere is a small lake\
  \ in the middle with pelicans, ducks and colourful fish. Relaxing enough?\nThe last\
  \ is ,of course, shopping. The oldest and largest trade centre in the entire Northeast\
  \ India is Lewduh Bazar. It\u2019s not like your regular markets but a place where\
  \ you not only get to buy the specialties of this region in their most authentic\
  \ form but also experience the culture and mannerisms of the people here. This market\
  \ has a huge presence of natives which allows you to see and hear the local stories.\
  \ You will not find these stories in books or internet. What makes it more special\
  \ is that women majorly run the market as most of the shops here are handled by\
  \ them. This journey craves me for many more journeys. \nThank you\n\nLove,\nKanchan"
