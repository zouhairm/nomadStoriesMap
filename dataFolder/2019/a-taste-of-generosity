Text: "I watched as golden-brown skin and brightly colored scraps of fabric flashed\
  \ between the rows of trees. The sun was just beginning to set, and the group of\
  \ adults responsible for my well-being were expecting me back any minute. I was\
  \ sixteen and this, a volunteer trip to Ecuador, was my first real experience being\
  \ outside of the U.S.A. I stood shivering and confused. Just moments before, I had\
  \ been wrapped warmly in my grey fleece jacket with the name of my team neatly scrolled\
  \ across the front in blue embroidery. Now, a woman I hadn\u2019t spoken more than\
  \ two words to, carried the jacket with her through rows of tamarillo trees, and\
  \ away from me.\n I continued watching as the small but beautiful Andean woman moved\
  \ skillfully across the steep terrain. She had beautiful long dark hair that was\
  \ neatly wrapped in a braid and her small stature left her nearly a foot shorter\
  \ than me. She seemed to weave effortlessly between rows of trees that held the\
  \ curious fruit I had wandered into her field to try. After passing by the field\
  \ for several days, I had finally succumbed to my curiosity and attempted to purchase\
  \ on one of the exotic looking fruits that dangled from the trees. I had approached\
  \ the woman tending the field with a single quarter in hand. I showed her the quarter\
  \ and sheepishly murmured \u201Cfruta?\u201D while motioning at the trees teeming\
  \ with the peculiar red fruit. She smiled and nodded but then she began tugging\
  \ at my jacket. I tried to refuse, knowing I had nothing else to protect me from\
  \ the biting winds that whipped across the Andean mountainside. She persisted, ignoring\
  \ my protest, and before I knew it she had made off halfway across her field leaving\
  \ me shivering, quarter still in hand. My mind panicked as I came to the conclusion\
  \ that I had accidentally just traded my only jacket for a few pieces of fruit.\
  \ \nThe woman was now out of sight. I sat down on the low stone wall and bit my\
  \ lip to keep tears from welling up, trying to figure out how I would explain losing\
  \ my only jacket to the adults in charge of me. Before I had come up with a good\
  \ excuse for the lost jacket the woman reappeared over the hillside. The jacket\
  \ I though to be lost forever was now slung over her shoulders like a makeshift\
  \ bag and bulging with brightly colored orange and red tamarillos. She approached\
  \ me, grinning, and hung the jacket, overflowing with fruit, like a sling over my\
  \ shoulder. I sheepishly offered her the quarter, which now felt like not nearly\
  \ enough but she wagged her finger, refusing the offer. We stood mere yards from\
  \ her one-room cinderblock home. She examined me head to toe, taking in my Levi\
  \ jeans and naivety, shaking her head making a little clicking sound with her tongue\
  \ and smiling. I looked over her leathery, earth worn hands and smiled back feeling\
  \ overwhelmed by her generosity.  \nPerhaps she was just being friendly, or perhaps\
  \ she knew that I was a na\xEFve American kid set on solving all of the world\u2019\
  s problems. Perhaps she knew that I didn\u2019t understand the power of true generosity.\
  \ Perhaps she knew that what she had to give me was worth far more than both my\
  \ quarter and the fleece jacket I\u2019d been so concerned about losing. What she\
  \ couldn\u2019t have known is that her kindness to me in that moment would open\
  \ my eyes to the beauty of making connections despite barriers of language, culture,\
  \ or status. The moment I shared with this unknown Ecuadorian woman, wrapped up\
  \ in a jacketful of tamarillos, would be the spark that would inspire me to continue\
  \ seeking connection through travel."
