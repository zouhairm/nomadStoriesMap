Text: "I have never been to a lot of places. I ain't from a rich or adventurous family.\
  \ My grandparents were born in inner cities in S\xE3o Paulo and that's were myparents\
  \ remained. So, writing a story about a travel isn't that easy for those whose greatest\
  \ journey until the age of 15 were going to the city next door. Brazil is a big\
  \ country where every state seems like other country due to our diversity. So, at\
  \ my late's 19, my sister, whose in the middle of her master, were called to ministrate\
  \ a lecture in Bel\xE9m, Par\xE1, at the other side of the country. She asked me\
  \ to go with her. And I accepted. It isn't a great beginning for a adventure store,\
  \ but it's the way it started. So I went. We flyed over the intire country. It was\
  \ exausting. I just wanted to walk, to see land, to feel my foot on the ground.\
  \ But, as we approach, I saw something. There was an ocean. Not literally, but it\
  \ could be. Surrounding the entire city. It could be swallowing it that it wouldn't\
  \ matter. This amount of water is called Ba\xEDa do Guajar\xE1. And it was beautiful.\
  \ I've already been to the coast of the country but it wans't the same. Because\
  \ you know the ocean doesn't end until the next country. But this place, it had\
  \ an beggining and an end, and it still semeed infinite. When I got out of the plane\
  \ and finally went to see the Baia in person, It looked so big that I couldn't believe\
  \ that it had limites when viewed from above. And then I saw the people who were\
  \ there. They looked like any other person in the intire world, but I realized they\
  \ had limits. And wich one of us have our own limits. Like a bay. We can seem invincible,\
  \ but we are absolutly mundane. We can seem infinity, but we have borders that limit\
  \ us. And that's ok. I see, everyday, people trying to become something they are\
  \ not. I see they trying to transform a bay into an ocean. But what, at most times,\
  \ they don't realize, is how amazing a bay can be. I know this isn't a big adventure\
  \ with an amazing final. But from any travel, being to the city next door, or 500\
  \ miles away, can make you discover wonderful things. Can make you realize your\
  \ human. Can make you realize that other people are human. Can make you realize\
  \ that it's ok to be a bay."
