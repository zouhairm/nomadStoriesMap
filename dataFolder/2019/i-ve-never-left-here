Text: "Having never left the United States since 3 months old, being adopted from\
  \ India, I have always yearned to travel. My suburban upbringing was not spoiled,\
  \ not lacking by any means, but my parents do not like air travel, so all trips\
  \ needed to be within a reasonable driving radius.  My travel destinations included\
  \ Wellfleet, Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, and Ogunquit Maine, and various day trips\
  \ to Boston, or New York.  Later in life, I went to Tennesse for Bonaroo, Miami,\
  \ FLorida, Jacksonville, Phoneix, Arizona, Baltimore, MD, The Outer Banks, and New\
  \ Orleans.  \nI have always enjoyed writing, and taking in new surroundings and\
  \ exploring.  I spent over 10 years professionally cooking, so absorbing a culture,\
  \ destination through it\u2019s food is one of my pinnacle means of immersion. \
  \ For instance, one of my favorite chefs is Nina Compton, and I got to choose where\
  \ the company I worked at was going to stay.  The restaurant is in the hotel, which\
  \ is a historically an old candle factory.  Eating there was one of the most transcendental\
  \ meals I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  From course one, we were wowed\
  \ by the plating and presentation, the flavor profile, as well as the pairing. \
  \ \nI live for these types of experiences, and hope to amass more as life progresses."
