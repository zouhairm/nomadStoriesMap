Text: "Few years back I was feeling little down so decided to travel. After much consideration\
  \ I decided to go up the mountains, so I took my car and drove till Kasul a beautiful\
  \ little town in Himalayas. It is famous for its own reasons but for me it was just\
  \ beautiful, green small place out of the world. After reaching there next morning\
  \ I decided to go little up the mountain with local. We treked around 5 hours and\
  \ reached a place. In my own world it was the most beautiful place I have ever seen.\
  \ Green, sunlight falling on snow and cherry on the top local people making it colorful.\
  \ It was one of the most amazing experiences I have had. I didn\u2019t took my camera\
  \ that day just went on trekking didn\u2019t even know where I was going. But each\
  \ moment of that trek is still fresh in my mind till date. \nI stayed there for\
  \ a night in the tent close to the village. It was bit scary I was all by myself\
  \ and could hear animals out at night, almost stayed up whole night and then cane\
  \ the best part, the sun rise. Never ever seen such a moment in my life till now.\
  \ It was mesmerizing, sun throwing his light on the peaks covered in snow making\
  \ it look orange, sky complimenting the snow covers mountains in sky blue and tint\
  \ of touroise. It seemed like a view in a painting. That moment is captured in my\
  \ memory unfortunately not in my camera. \nI could see few local ladies coming towards\
  \ me with a cup of tea and some bread for breakfast. They sat with me and sang local\
  \ hymns in praise of lord shiva and also taught me few words in their language.\
  \ \nI wasn\u2019t expecting any of this, the hospitality of nature and locals was\
  \ amazing and unforgettable."
