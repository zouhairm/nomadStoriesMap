Text: 'As I was making my comeback to Kuala Lumpur after years I didn''t think of
  anything but to spend my days by rehearsing the past journey.


  It was not until I passed by the immigration and went to the airport bus station
  that I made a u-turn of my imaginary stays. The very much well-maintained bus shelter
  said it all.


  The comfortable bus seat to downtown allowed me to figure what could KL offer now
  as scenes are so much better than what I had in mine.


  So, to allow me understand better of KL in the present; instead of recalling fully
  of what was, I began searching of how the people treat themselves daily by cafe
  hopping.


  Choosing small yet warm ambience (in the hope to meet the owners or person-in-charge)
  woule give better ideas of how people live and do today.


  Fortunately in most of the places whether it was a hidden, coffee shop on second
  floor to suburb tea cafe I got to meet the owners and spent some time with them.


  One proprietor might have the same idea of visiting other countries to see the others
  tea cafes, while one preferred to develop local coffee scene that would bring pride
  to the country.


  Above all, with a cup of coffee or a pot of tea, we all believe that we are one
  in unity. We may come from different countries and talk different languages, but
  at the end we still sit on one place and have a good laugh.


  After all the good talks I usually ended my dy by having local delicacies of what
  I used to eat. Still, there is a piece that you want to keep for yourself, but not
  least as a memory for the future.'
