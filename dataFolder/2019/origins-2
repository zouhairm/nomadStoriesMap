Text: "At a bar in Old Town Nice, I met a man who looked like Johnny Depp. He unironically\
  \ said he was a sailor, tasked with cruising wealthy tourists around the Cote d\u2019\
  Azur all day. Another man with him claimed to be Australian but that did not check\
  \ out with the accent. I never learned the name of the third guy but he was from\
  \ Monaco, and everyone spent the night calling him the Prince of Monaco\u2014for\
  \ all I know, he could have been. \nI was traveling alone in the south of France\
  \ for a week at a time when I was feeling particularly fuzzy about my identity.\
  \ After a whirlwind semester in Paris and then a semester back at school, followed\
  \ by a summer in New York, I was in the midst of something like an identity crisis,\
  \ but the version for 21 year olds. \n     Johnny and his band of misfits took me\
  \ in that night. We drank beer and played pool and they told me that they were people\
  \ of the world, vagabonds who grew up everywhere and had never belonged anywhere.\
  \ At one point hours into the evening, Johnny raised his beer glass into the middle\
  \ of everyone and, with a flourish, asked what the first thing was that everyone\
  \ thought of in the morning. No one answered seriously. The fake Australian muttered\
  \ something unfit for sharing. I thought to myself that it wasn\u2019t something\
  \ I had ever taken note of. Johnny lowered his glass and seemed to look all of us\
  \ in the eyes at the same time. \u201CFor me,\u201D he said, \u201Cit\u2019s chaos.\u201D\
  \ \nIn hindsight I realize that anyone who says that is either a serial killer or\
  \ totally full of it, but that night in a city I had never been to, with people\
  \ I did not know, it registered as profound. Time has a way of moving inward instead\
  \ of forward when you travel. Each moment is distilled into hours, sometimes a full\
  \ lifetime. The boundaries of one life dissolve and bleed into another, sometimes\
  \ brighter one. We are repeatedly told that we have to return to reality, but doesn\u2019\
  t that seem arbitrary? What is so unrealistic about this other life? Who are we\
  \ if we prefer that story?\n\tOur parents began crafting our origin stories before\
  \ we ever stepped foot on the earth, imagining who we would be and what our life\
  \ would look like when we were still just zygotes in our mothers\u2019 bellies.\
  \ Over time our identity narrative has been meticulously molded, culminating in\
  \ the story of us.\nYet travel gives us the rare opportunity to live a different\
  \ narrative. Away from home, we can make decisions we wouldn\u2019t normally make,\
  \ can be versions of ourselves we wouldn\u2019t normally be. Johnny and the fake\
  \ Australian too embarrassed to admit his name was Craig and the fake Prince of\
  \ Monaco weren\u2019t always these people. At one point, maybe eons ago, they were\
  \ entirely different people, living entirely different lives. Maybe they were even\
  \ trying to avoid the chaos they now chased. \n     In this pub with these strangers\
  \ I felt closer to the life I\u2019d lived in Paris than I had in the past eight\
  \ months. Perhaps because I felt out of place and alone and unable to answer their\
  \ questions. Perhaps just because I was back in France. Either way I longed, for\
  \ a person and a place, certainly, but more than anything for myself. \n     On\
  \ the train ride out of Nice I thought about how sardonic it is that travel demands\
  \ a return. We always wish it would never end, that the sunset would never sink\
  \ into the ocean and the dawn would never peek out over the mountains. That we could\
  \ always be as free-spirited, as adventurous, as passionate as we are when we\u2019\
  re away. If we\u2019re lucky, those things will stay with us forever, but it\u2019\
  s true that we can\u2019t have travel without home, can\u2019t register our change\
  \ unless we have an origin to compare it to\u2014maybe Johnny can, but most of us\
  \ aren\u2019t so unlucky."
