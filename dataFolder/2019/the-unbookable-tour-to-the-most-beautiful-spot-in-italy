Text: "Instead of chilling at the beach of Terracina, a small town further south to\
  \ Rome, I find myself in a dentist practice in Rome, assisting in a dental surgery.\
  \ And no, I\u2019m not a trained medical assistant. But it doesn\u2019t end here.\
  \ It\u2019s going to become unexpectedly gorgeous - something you cannot book ahead.\n\
  \nIt all starts in Rome. It\u2019s August, and my friend Anna and I take a break\
  \ from studying. We are approaching our accommodation which is close to Campo de\u2018\
  \ Fiori, in one of these typical narrow alleys with cobblestones, framed by graceful\
  \ old buildings which radiate tranquility, style and a feeling of being home. They\
  \ appear calm and contrast the vivid excitement in these little streets of passionate\
  \ Italian chatter and loud motor scooters. But the noise disappears when the four-meter\
  \ high heavy gateway of our accomodation falls into its lock. There is now only\
  \ stillness and peace left in this inner courtyard, where a statue of Pompeius watches\
  \ over the scenery. The rooms of our accomodation are a continuation of this tranquil\
  \ atmosphere. It\u2019s hot, but it\u2019s quiet and peaceful. There is no hurry\
  \ in anything. The ceilings which are prolific in historic stuccos facilitate this\
  \ feeling. And the crown is the roof terrace with a view at church towers and Rome\u2018\
  s roofs who are marked by time but yet so full of grace. \n\nAfter a couple of days\
  \ of sightseeing, having incredible amounts of heavenly-made gelato and exploiting\
  \ the nearby bakery \u201EAntico Forno Roscioli\u201C (the pizza, the lemon cake\
  \ and the apple pie are not from this world), we make our way to our pre-booked\
  \ destination Terracina \u2013 a small town at the seaside. We\u2019re on the train\
  \ when there is suddenly the announcement that the train terminates here and we\
  \ have to continue our journey with a replacement bus. We make it to Terracina but\
  \ our room is not ready yet. So we take a stroll through town. It\u2019s unspectacular.\
  \ There is nothing special to see. Quite frankly, the whole vibe feels a bit degenerative.\
  \ After two hours, we return to our suppossed-to-be accomodation and still, we cannot\
  \ check in. The room will be available just next day. Until then, the landlord will\
  \ drive us to a different location, plus, he will give us rides anywhere we want\
  \ to go. Sounds lovely, but how can we tell him where to go or where to pick us\
  \ up if we don\u2019t have a language in common? We are just now lucky enough that\
  \ an Italian guest speaks English and does the translations for us. There was some\
  \ poo. We could smell it. So it was time for an exit or a return to Rome, where\
  \ life is so amazingly beautiful. \n\nBut train connections are not that reliable\
  \ in Italy, especially if replacement buses are already in operation. So we decide\
  \ to call Marco, a Roman dentist we met at the Spanish Steps a couple of days ago.\
  \ He does make this effort, but he had to postpone a dental surgery for this good\
  \ deed. As a compensation, he needs one of us to assist in this outstanding dental\
  \ surgery. First, I thought this was a joke, but now I have to swear not to pass\
  \ out, followed by putting on a surgical mask and making use of the exhauster \u2013\
  \ always hoping I don\u2019t hurt the patient. \n\nWe can stay in Marco\u2019s flat\
  \ in Rome this night, and the next day he wants to take us to his residence in Tuscany.\
  \ It\u2019s at the peninsular Monte Argentario, a popular spot among Italians, but\
  \ not so well-known among tourists. Its mountain is blessed with a huge forest hosting\
  \ much wildlife, and only here and then, elegant villas remind of human life. Not\
  \ to forget, the ubiquitous sea you can look at from nearly every spot. The harbour\
  \ provides a home for numerous boats \u2013 perfect for boat owners or people who\
  \ want to rent one, and the beaches lead to crystal blue water. So here we are in\
  \ a place we could not have booked ahead. We are lucky Terracina didn\u2019t work\
  \ out because Monte Argentario is such a treasure in authentic dolce vita and pristine\
  \ nature."
