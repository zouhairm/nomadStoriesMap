Text: "Taking the spiral staircase up to the roof of 14 Creek Lane, I was thinking\
  \ about all the members of my family that made a similar journey and experienced\
  \ the same view. The surrounding landscape of Central Kolkata may have changed since\
  \ my great-grandfather built this house back in 1904, but I\u2019m sure peering\
  \ over the ledge atop the family home was just as exhilarating for my dad and me\
  \ that slightly brisk February day as it was for past generations of the Gomes clan.\
  \ \n\nThis was my first visit to the three-storied home, where my grandfather was\
  \ raised and where my dad was born, in over twenty years. Not knowing when I would\
  \ return, I was determined to make the most out of this trip and establish those\
  \ connections that I will never forget.\n\nReturning to the upper floor of the home,\
  \ I scrolled through some family documents. I was most intrigued by the information\
  \ regarding J.A. Gomes, my great-great-grandfather and our oldest-known ancestor.\
  \ The document included details of his burial site, located in a Kolkata cemetery.\
  \ I took a photograph of the information and made a note to add the grave of J.A.\
  \ Gomes to our itinerary. \n\nThe next day would be devoted to more traditional\
  \ sightseeing. With the help of a local taxi driver, we visited some of Kolkata\u2019\
  s major tourist attractions\u2014Victoria Memorial, St. John\u2019s Church, Eden\
  \ Gardens, Howrah Bridge. Unfortunately, our wish to go to the cemetery reached\
  \ a dead end. \n\nSoorah Cemetery, as it was listed on the photographed document,\
  \ led us to a Protestant cemetery that closed in 1790. It was unlikely my Catholic\
  \ great-great-grandfather who died in 1871 was buried here. We left disappointed,\
  \ but my dad and I agreed that this wasn\u2019t the end of the search.\n\nIn hindsight,\
  \ we should have inquired our local relatives for help from the start. My dad\u2019\
  s cousins Willie and Margaret made annual visits to the cemetery. J.A.\u2019s Gomes\u2019\
  \ gravesite also served as the gravesite of their father and many other family members.\
  \ Not risking another disappointment, we would bring Margaret with us.\n\nAs the\
  \ three of us pulled up to the cemetery, the sign at the entrance revealed that\
  \ our early attempt was lost in transliteration. \n\nSoarah Catholic Cemetery was\
  \ a quaint oasis from the bustle of Bellighata Road. On a particularly bright day,\
  \ it was a little challenging reading the inscriptions on the gravestones. Thankfully,\
  \ Margaret led the way to the grave site. The primary cross-shaped tombstone belonged\
  \ to Michael Gomes\u2014my great-uncle and the youngest brother of Margaret and\
  \ my dad\u2019s respective fathers. The marker stood above a thicket of overgrown\
  \ weeds. \n\nPushing away the thicket revealed a secondary stone laid into the ground.\
  \ Clearing the dust with a splash of water confirmed that it was the marker for\
  \ J.A. Gomes, who died on 19th May 1871, aged 53. We finally made it. After taking\
  \ some requisite pictures, the three of us stood in silent reflection. My mind went\
  \ to the various routes and journeys that led me to this gravesite nearly 150 years\
  \ after J.A. Gomes\u2019 death.\n\nAs important as Kolkata is to our family\u2019\
  s history, we have always considered our point of origin to be Hashnabad, a village\
  \ that falls in current-day Bangladesh. In the early 19th century, J.A. Gomes had\
  \ moved to Kolkata, then known as Calcutta and the capital of British India, to\
  \ secure the best possible life for his family. It was a journey not unlike the\
  \ one my grandfather embarked upon when he moved his family to Dhaka shortly after\
  \ the Partition of 1947 or the journeys my father undertook moving our family to\
  \ the United Arab Emirates and later to Canada. \n\nWe dropped Margaret off at 14\
  \ Creek Lane and said our goodbyes to both her and the house that was feeling more\
  \ and more like my own home. On the walk back to our hotel, I realized that what\
  \ constitutes \u201Chome\u201D isn\u2019t determined by a passport or birth certificate.\
  \ Home is where your heart and mind lead you. \n\nI\u2019m not sure when my heart\
  \ and mind will lead me back to 14 Creek Lane and Kolkata, I just hope it doesn\u2019\
  t take another twenty years."
