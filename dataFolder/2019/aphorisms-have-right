Text: "\u201CIf my life was in theory, my one would be perfect\u201D. I never tought\
  \ to give reason to an aphorism written up above a key fob in a souvenir shop.\n\
  In theory, we know how much important friends are. In theory. Until then, you consider\
  \ that principle as something normal. Normal as the sunlight during the morning\
  \ or normal as your everiday life. This until the pratical demonstration of that\
  \ theorical principle smashes against your face like a glass door of which you realize\
  \ too late.\nAll of us know things in theory. And only the life of each of us \u2013\
  \ by its cases \u2013 is deputazed to give us the tangible demonstration of these\
  \ principle considered teorical until then. And as I'm not the life (luckily!),\
  \ I can only tell you the pratical demonstration that life has gave me.\nThe demonstration\
  \ arrived at a little pub in Paris, after a journey by bus from Strasbourg lasted\
  \ seven hours, while my travel companions (strangers until the day before) recount\
  \ me about their life, their experiences and their emotions. This is a really simple\
  \ thing but not banal, trust me. It's not banal to spend two or three hours talking\
  \ with your roommate late at night, while the others slept. Or it's not banal to\
  \ be lost in a town that you don't know. Trust me: a life deserved to be lived is\
  \ made by simple things.It doesn't mind wich position do you cover inside society,\
  \ or what you have and its quantity. I know that it could sounds banal, but it isn't\
  \ so. Every day is a travel and every day we have travel mates. And every person\
  \ is a travel.\nPlease, trust me. Yes, I know it sounds banal, but make an effort:\
  \ try to meet the others in your life. It's the only way to live life. The rest\
  \ doesn't mind.\n\u201CWho travels without meet the others doesn't travel. He only\
  \ moves\u201D.\n I read this sentence up above a calendar."
