Text: "I took the pen, the thin line slid down the paper smoothly and I began to write\
  \ what would be the beginning of an ending.\nIt was less than 48 hours to travel.\
  \ It was Sunday and the next day I would be at the boarding gate of the flight to\
  \ Aeroparque. From there I would take a transport to the hotel to arrive in time\
  \ on Tuesday at Ezeiza where the flight to Honololu would be waiting for me.\nAnd\
  \ so it was, Tuesday 19 hours was sitting with tickets in hand.\nThe first days\
  \ I would have talked about the landscapes of Hawaii, beaches for all kinds of activities,\
  \ mountain, a paradise. But the circumstances make me choose to talk about what\
  \ caused me to stay in a hostel and meet other cultures.\nTraveling alone made me\
  \ interact, talk with others and the truth that what impacted me the most was the\
  \ kindness they had there. Also the differences, the majority crossed more than\
  \ five countries before they came to Hawaii...me only one.. at least of course the\
  \ conditions are different. However they had a deep-rooted work culture, what I\
  \ loved most was there were no complexes, they didn't judge. \nEverything was perfect.\
  \ I was in a country but at the same time I felt that I was in all. \nHave you ever\
  \ felt free and capable of taking the world ahead? That is how I got up every day:\
  \ eager to live life. The \"today for you tomorrow for me\" rule, all so different\
  \ but so equal. And we dressed and acted differently but deep down we longed for\
  \ living free, delivered to the destination and the surprises that the trip would\
  \ get in the way."
