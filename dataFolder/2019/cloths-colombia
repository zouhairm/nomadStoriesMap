Text: "The tales we tell each other become the fabrics of our tribes. We become proud\
  \ of our multifaceted tapestry, admiring the faded patterns, rough edges and loose\
  \ ends.\n\nWe even look past the uneven stitching. \n\nFour months ago, as my aircraft\
  \ descended into the Medellin hills, I knew the decision to finally visit my father's\
  \ people was not a decision to take lightly. It was a conversation I had buried\
  \ deep in the inner crevasses of my mind, a deafening command from my inner self.\
  \ \n\n\"You have to go. You better do it, and you'd better do it now.\" \n\nAt 19\
  \ years old, any sort of command kicks in an inner instinct to rebel. However, unlike\
  \ \"you must do the dishes\", or, \"you must put the doughnut down,\" this one came\
  \ as much from a place of curiosity as it did fear. After all, nobody says \"you\
  \ must visit Colombia\", as if doing it on a whim was a normal expectation. Colombia\
  \ was unconventional. It was dangerous. It was unknown territory. \n\nIt was Colombia.\
  \ \n\nColombia draws many connotations to less than favourable images. It's nearly\
  \ synonymous for the other C word. It was something I had previously struggled to\
  \ be proud of. \n\nThis was because decades before the dawn of the 21st century,\
  \ Colombia faced it's the longest night in history. Without sounding like a manuscript\
  \ to Narcos, the cloth became a wet rag covering the wounds of the Colombian people,\
  \ and the world watched as they struggled to gather the leftover fragments of humanity\
  \ and hope from the shrapnel and dust. The cloak had become muddied and ruined,\
  \ with crimson blotches that wouldn't come out in the wash. \n\nWithin my first\
  \ few weeks, I realised this mattered very little to Medellin's eventual bloom.\
  \  \n\nToday, Medellin has become one of the safest cities in Latin America. She\
  \ is the jewel of Antioquia, saluting the condors as they fly over blue skies and\
  \ a brighter city. Today, the birds sing a different song - they sing soliloquies\
  \ of peace, and their voice can be heard all across the country. \n\nIri's Inner\
  \ Voice: 1\nIri's Doughnut Voice: 0\n\nTaking the risk to experience the City of\
  \ Eternal Spring has, above all things, taught me to remain hopeful. Even in the\
  \ face of adversity. Even when all feels lost. Finally being able to eclipse together\
  \ my identity feels a lot like taking your first breath after diving into deep waters.\
  \ I took the risk, and did the thing that scared me. \n\nI can even pull the ugly\
  \ comforter I've had for years over my head. This time, with an odd sense of familiarity.\
  \ \n\nI couldn't be prouder to be a Colombian-Kiwi.  \n\nAs humans, we intrinsically\
  \ understand that within all of us, there is a hidden pain that we must overcome.\
  \ Whether it be loss, failure, disappointment or disdain, each day, we lift ourselves\
  \ out of bed to the promise of a new day.\n\nAnd that's a very special thing. \n\
  \nToday, Medellin has achieved more than ever could've been expected many years\
  \ ago. As the World Economic Forum's latest and only innovation hub for Latin America,\
  \ and from Forbes' Most Dangerous City to Forbes' Next Urban Industry Disruptor,\
  \ one thing becomes clear: \nTime is but the pendulum of progress. \n\nAnd so we\
  \ may be too. \n\nYou have come too far to not go further, and you have done too\
  \ much to not do more. \n\nThe journey continues, and as we wave our wild colours\
  \ in the air, we know the narrative coming has new terrain, new threadwork, and\
  \ new tales to come.\n\nWear your very best."
