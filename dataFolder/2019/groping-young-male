Text: "While on tour of South East Africa, one of the last highlights was Gorilla\
  \ Trekking. Our group of 8 (5 girls from my tour and a random couple) were driving\
  \ out to our spot before hiking up and down a \"hill\" to find our family of gorillas.\
  \ I use the term hill loosely. If a mountain and another mountain had a baby, that\
  \ is what we climbed. But the locals called it a small hill... well for Uganda it\
  \ was. \nAt the top of the \"hill\", we got our speech about not getting too close\
  \ to the gorillas, do not interact with them and most of all do not make sudden\
  \ movements or loud noises. I didn't pay much attention as I was way too excited\
  \ to see these animals in the wild. You know like Gorillas in the Mist or Tarzan.\
  \ After our talk and a little food and drink, we walked down our \"hill\" and we\
  \ stop just outside the tree line as our trackers have found our family just inside\
  \ the trees (YAY) and we needed to be ready and quiet (shh). \nSo with 3 girls in\
  \ front of me and the other 4 behind me, we start to move quietly into the trees\
  \ and no longer then 5 minutes later we spot our first gorilla. Holding back the\
  \ squeals and the OMG's, my heart starts beating so fast so when the girls whisper\
  \ \"Look a baby\" I think I'm about to cry. The girls all stop to look at the baby\
  \ on top of a little bump in the track and I'm stuck in the dip standing on tippy\
  \ toes to try and see the baby. \"Where? Where? I can't see it.\" \nThe girl behind\
  \ me bumps into me, I figured she must not have realised we had stopped to look\
  \ at the baby, since I wasn't wearing any break lights, so I turn around to tell\
  \ her to wait a minute. Only she wasn't behind me. No there was a good 2 metres\
  \ between us. But, I do notice a black thing walking into the trees out of the corner\
  \ of my eye. So I keep spinning and see an almost silverback gorilla just casually\
  \ walking away. I am pretty sure my heart stopped, my mouth was gaping, my brain\
  \ was telling me to remain calm while my legs were yelling RUN! I had been so pre-occupied\
  \ with trying to see the baby that I had NOT noticed the 12 year old male gorilla\
  \ walking up the hill towards us to get to the trees behind us. Luckily the girl\
  \ behind noticed but still did not prevent me from being groped by a gorilla. I\
  \ felt special and a little violated at the same time. There was no small talk or\
  \ asking me how I was before the brushing against my butt. It took about 3 seconds\
  \ for me to snap back to reality and start taking photos of his butt walking away\
  \ after touching mine. \"See how you like it when I post it all over facebook\"\
  \ was my second thought. First thought: Don't faint. \nAfter an hour with these\
  \ beautiful creatures we left and climbed back up our \"hill\" and then and only\
  \ then was I able to voice my opinion. \"Cheeky little s**t felt my ass! Bloody\
  \ teenagers. Do anything to cop a feel!\" I was the butt of everyones joke on the\
  \ way back..."
