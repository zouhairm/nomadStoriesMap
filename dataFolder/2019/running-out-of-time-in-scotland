Text: "It is only after I have been waiting at the Edinburgh Bus Station for twenty\
  \ minutes that I realize I have missed my bus to Glasgow. I had booked a 5.00 pm\
  \ bus that was supposed to reach the Buchanan Bus Station in Glasgow at 6.30 pm.\
  \ From there, I had to take a bus to the airport to catch an 8.35 pm Flybe flight\u2014\
  the cheapest I could find out of Scotland\u2014to Belfast, where I had a Game of\
  \ Thrones tour booked for the following morning.\n\nHowever, at some point during\
  \ the day, my mind had reprogrammed itself into believing that my bus leaves for\u2014\
  and not reaches\u2014Glasgow at 6.30 pm. \n\nI rush to the ticket counter and inquire\
  \ about the next bus. \n\n\u201CThe next one\u2019s at 6.10 pm. It\u2019s waiting\
  \ there.\u201D \n\nI board it and ask the driver how much time we would take. \n\
  \n\u201CCan\u2019t say for sure. There\u2019s traffic on the highway.\u201D\n\n\
  I trudge to my seat, whip up my phone, and start calculating.\n\nThe last bus I\
  \ can take from Buchanan to the airport is at 7.30. If I miss it, Uber would be\
  \ the only remaining option, but it would be prohibitively, outrageously expensive.\
  \ I check if there is a later flight I could catch. There is nothing that would\
  \ not burn a hole in my pocket. \n\nMy heart sinks. If I don\u2019t reach Belfast\
  \ before next morning, I will miss my 45-pound GoT tour, which I have been looking\
  \ forward to for months. What\u2019s worse \u2013 I would have to cancel my flight\
  \ out of Belfast and book a fresh set of tickets from Glasgow. In all, I would lose\
  \ about 200 pounds. \n\nThat\u2019s how much I roughly make for about two weeks\
  \ of slogging in office back in Delhi. If I miss my flight, the rest of this trip\
  \ would be ruined.\n\nI lower myself in my seat, phone my best friend, and start\
  \ crying. As always, he asks me to not panic. \u201CIt\u2019ll all be okay. Relax.\u201D\
  \n\nMy bus reaches Glasgow at 7.27. I disembark and run to the 7.30 \u2013 which\
  \ is stipulated to take 25 minutes to reach the airport. \n\nIf it takes exactly\
  \ this much time, I would have 10 minutes to find the Flybe counter and check in.\n\
  \nThe bus starts moving on time. I inhale deeply. Thank god this is Scotland. Back\
  \ home in India, a half-empty bus would never have commenced its journey on time.\
  \ \n\nMy relief, however, is short-lived. There are multiple stops and traffic lights\
  \ along the route. At the third stop, two young women get on. One of them starts\
  \ small-talking with the driver, while the other takes an eternity to look for change\
  \ in her elephantine bag.\n\nSitting in one of the seats at the back, I am losing\
  \ my mind.\n\nYes, it is nice to have everyone smile and be polite in this country,\
  \ but god, sometimes the British overdo the pleasantries.\n\nI arrive at the airport\
  \ with only seven minutes to check in.\n\nA week ago, as I had stepped off a curb\
  \ in Central London, my right knee had suddenly started hurting. Since then, every\
  \ step, without painkillers, has been like a weekend chore: unpleasant but unavoidable.\n\
  \nAs I get off the bus, I am not on painkillers. \n\nI don\u2019t care. I run for\
  \ dear life. By the time I reach the Flybe counter, I am panting.\n\n\u201CI-have-a-flight-in-30-minutes-I-don\u2019\
  t-have-any-bags-to-check-in-can-you-please-check-if-I-can-still-go.\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ female executive behind the counter picks up the landline, calls the security,\
  \ and asks if I would be allowed. After she hangs up, she hands over my boarding\
  \ pass.\n\n\u201CThe gates are on the first level. You have two minutes. Please\
  \ hurry up.\u201D\n\nI run. My knees protest. My throat is parched. Everybody looks\
  \ at me. I don\u2019t care.\n\nI throw my shoes and backpack in the tray at the\
  \ security check. I come out on the other side. Continue my sprint. \n\nI reach\
  \ the boarding gates to see my fellow passengers reading newspapers and sipping\
  \ tea. Some of them fiddle with their phones. Nobody applauds my performance. I\
  \ sink into a couch, my knee throbbing. \n\n\u201CYou have no idea how much I miss\
  \ you,\u201D I text my best friend."
