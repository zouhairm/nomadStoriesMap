Text: "Convictions that conquered the world! \n\nLife is never the same again! As\
  \ I got back in to the car and left Cambridge behind, I left a part of me, in to\
  \ that distant historic past of the Village of Cambridge. \n\nIt is the story of\
  \ a young boy growing up in a distant little town in South India. The story of dreams.\
  \ He grew up dreaming of Cambridge. The Cambridge which taught his childhood hero,\
  \ a brilliant mathematician who quit a glittering Cambridge career to serve humanity\
  \ in the dusty lanes of his town. \n\nWhat did it mean to be in Cambridge? Was the\
  \ rhetoric often spoken about in that part of the land! What did it mean to be in\
  \ Cambridge? was almost a talisman growing up. \n\nCambridge meant history! The\
  \ history the boy in me so loved. History of so many years that both the hands with\
  \ all its fingers each counting a century is not enough. And so, began my journey\
  \ to this historic place, first in my dreams, much later in reality.\n\nThis village\
  \ has contributed to 118 Nobel prize winners, my tour guide said! I caught hold\
  \ of every word of his, like life\u2019s treasures. 118? Oh ya, he shrugged it off!\
  \ There was an air of nonchalance in that body gyration. He went on! I stopped there.\
  \ 118! I replayed that number in my mind again. The whole of my country has five,\
  \ and we celebrate that number. A three-digit stat was beyond belief. I was just\
  \ about recovering when he said Rutherford discovered electrons in the lab next\
  \ door. And do you know \u2018Watson and Crick\u2019? they celebrated the discovery\
  \ of DNA in the bar there right across the street. That man continued on his monologue.\
  \ Not realizing the profundity of his own statements. \n\nAfter talking about Sir.\
  \ Isaac Newton, Dr Stephen Hawking, Dr. Charles Darwin, Bertrand Russel, and Charles\
  \ Babbage he took a break! Maybe he realized I was still recovering from the number\
  \ 118! \n\nSuddenly it hit me hard. The names do not matter in Cambridge! But it\
  \ is the ideas; the convictions, that matter. Of course, Sir. Isaac Newton lives\
  \ on. Yet the Idea of gravity that came out of the hollow blocks is the better optics\
  \ for the village of Cambridge. \n\nConvictions are things certain! The certainty\
  \ of the ideas which germinated in the minds of the people who lived in this remarkable\
  \ village.\n\nJust to reinstate this, the street corner opposite to the most famous\
  \ kings\u2019 college is the corpus clock which shows the exact time only once in\
  \ fifteen minutes. So that clock slows down and fastens up on time every fifteenth\
  \ minute. And it is completely made of mechanical parts. How is that even possible?\
  \ Well, In Cambridge it is possible! \n\nI took the quiet boat ride across the colleges\
  \ soaking into the glory of Cambridge\u2019s historicity. The stunning landscape.\
  \ The refreshing greenery. The huge cathedrals. The old hollow blocks. Yet, when\
  \ I closed my eyes, Cambridge meant something else. It meant dreams.  \n\nFor it\
  \ is the place where dreams become reality and in reality, people dream. Dream about\
  \ big ideas; until they become convictions; till those convictions conquer the world."
