Text: "On the east side of beautiful Indonesia, there\u2019s a beautiful islands called\
  \ Raja Ampat, they are Misool, Waigeo, Batanta, and Salawati. It takes around 12\
  \ hours from Jakarta, the capital city, by planes and speed boat to the island.\
  \ In Misool island, there are iconic hills, Dapunlol and Dafalen (The Love Lagoon).\n\
  \nWe stayed at Panun Island, it was inhabitant island, then a man lives there and\
  \ build an environmental and affordable friendly resort.  It takes 50 minutes by\
  \ speed boat to go to Dapunlol.  At that time, it\u2019s very steep to go to the\
  \ top of the hills. The local government builds the woods stairs to help the people\
  \ step up, but it\u2019s still under construction. It was okay for the first 15\
  \ minutes, then it\u2019s more and more challenging. The gulch is on the left side,\
  \ next to us, we have to walk line one by one very slowly. After 45 minutes, we\
  \ arrive at the Dapunlol hills top. It\u2019s faster than the estimate time. All\
  \ the tense and tiredness are worth it. The beautiful graded lagoon lies in the\
  \ spreading karst islands. There are 3 beautiful spots, the first one is magnificent\
  \ old tree, the top of the karst and the stone with great views.\n\nThe next stop\
  \ is Dafalen Hill, it\u2019s 15 minutes from Dapunlol Hill. Here, you need to jump\
  \ from the boat and then climb the hill. The track here are more difficult, high\
  \ and steep. At Dapunlol, the track was easy at the beginning and sloping at some\
  \ area, but here, from the starts till the end, it\u2019s a non stop climbing and\
  \ we will reach the top in 35 minute. Then, there it is, the beautiful green and\
  \ blue love lagoon view straight in front of us.  We can see the love shape more\
  \ clear in the morning when the water is in low tide. There is another love hills\
  \ in the area, Karawapop, but it\u2019s already dark and we\u2019re all tired, we\u2019\
  re going back to our resort with a very big smile, get rest and get ready for the\
  \ next days.  Raja Ampat is definitely a must visit place on earth before you die.\
  \ It's not only you can find the love lagoon,  but you will find also the natural\
  \ infinity pool, diving and snorkling spots, stone age cave, beach, and the nice\
  \ people of Indonesia. Happy Valentine Day to all of us."
