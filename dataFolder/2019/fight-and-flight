Text: "With his sawed-off shotgun, the guard motions the Uber driver to the gate.\
  \ We\u2019d inched over an hour in Easter Week traffic from my Santo Domingo apartment.\
  \ Frank, the friendly, middle-aged manager in a coral polo shirt and plaid Bermudas\
  \ shuffles my bag to the breezeway. I see no other guests.     \n \nCoworkers said\
  \ to rent a condo with a private beach--safe and much cheaper than the all-inclusive\
  \ resorts. I\u2019d booked online, lured by photos of the sea, but learn later the\
  \ property is built on a cliff with no access to it.  Frank says there\u2019s a\
  \ nearby beach.\n \n\u201CHow far?\u201D \n\u201CThree minutes.\u201D \n\n\u201C\
  Is it safe for me to walk there alone?\u201D\n\n\u201COf course. The President has\
  \ a home here, and with spring break, police are everywhere.\u201D\n\nHe crosses\
  \ the patio, and like a magician revealing what\u2019s behind the curtain, sweeps\
  \ up the metal shutters and smiles.\n\nI can\u2019t believe the panoramic ocean\
  \ view. Sprinklers glaze the grass and palm trees, leaving all Eden- fresh and parakeet\
  \ green. He points to a guard beside the pool bar. \u201CYou\u2019re safe here.\u201D\
  \n\nSinking into one of the loungers, I watch the waves churn. I\u2019ve made it.\
  \  Spring Break 2017, a milestone marking the final stretch of teaching three years\
  \ abroad. When my kids left the nest, I\u2019d flown away, too, and landed in Africa.\
  \ Solo. Sight unseen. In two months I\u2019ll return to Nashville. \n\nTwo years\
  \ in Morocco. Magical. A year in the Dominican Republic. Complicated.\n\nUnlike\
  \ Morocco, traveling solo was costly, so I spent most weekends alone in the city.\
  \ All my coworkers had family here, but when I did get away with friends... dancing\
  \ salsa, swimming in waterfalls, watching whales...Golden.\n\nI check the beach\
  \ path--  a wasteland of trash, glass, rocks and weeds. Two Dominican ladies in\
  \ large floppy hats walk this way. They are sisters. I ask to join them.\n\n\u201C\
  We\u2019re going to the beach where our kids have rented a place!\u201D says the\
  \ one with a New York accent.\n\nDodging beer bottles, we pass an abandoned, skeletal\
  \ structure\u2014three unfinished floors of a hotel--strangled by jungle. We walk\
  \ ten minutes more and see only two men fishing. \n\nFinally the NYC sister points.\
  \ \u201CThere\u2019s the place! Our room isn\u2019t ready, so we\u2019re staying\
  \ with them tonight.\u201D\n\nI\u2019ll be walking back alone.\n\nReading my face,\
  \ she offers: \u201CWe\u2019ll get someone to take you back by scooter. It won\u2019\
  t cost much.\u201D\n\nWe play in the water and by 1:00 I\u2019m ready for lunch.\
  \ People are everywhere now so I ask the NYC sister, \u201CIf you were me, would\
  \ you walk back alone?\u201D\n\n Hoisting a pretend boulder to her shoulder, she\
  \ laughs. \u201CIf somebody messed with me, I\u2019d knock him in the head! Stay\
  \ near the water, and if you need us, scream.\u201D\n\n I pass children playing\
  \ in the tide. When I come to the stretch of deserted property, I inhale and rush\
  \ on. Two guys in their twenties emerge from the jungle. Their eyes shoot toward\
  \ me, but they head the other way. Staying near the surf, I scan over my left shoulder.\
  \ Twice. \n\nWhen the sand turns to knee-high weeds, I veer inland. I glance behind,\
  \ turn around, and he has me. \n\nA face in a black knit ski mask whisper \u201C\
  Ssssssss\u201D in my right ear. His left arm wraps around my back and shoulder and\
  \ his right hand holds a curved, notched knife to my throat. \n\nThis can\u2019\
  t be happening. This isn\u2019t real. The nightmare I\u2019d had since a teen. Someone\
  \ grabs me, I try to scream, but no sound comes out. I fight hard to wake up. \n\
  \nBut I am awake.\n\nI turn up my palms to show him I have only a room key. \n\n\
  \u201CNada!\u201D I plead, hoping he doesn\u2019t see my grandmother\u2019s wedding\
  \ ring I\u2019ve worn since she died.\n\nHe pushes me with his body toward the jungle.\
  \  My eyes watch the knife. Help me God.\n \nI didn\u2019t expect how loud I could\
  \ scream. Neither did he. He lets go. I run out of my flip flops, shrieking with\
  \ every breath. I look back once as he stares through the mask deciding flight or\
  \ fight. He vanishes into the jungle as security runs my way."
