Text: "I met my fiance, Ian Ruggles, in a chat room of all places, while I was working\
  \ 3rd shift and had nothing to do for 5-6 hours at a time.  Thankfully, God sent\
  \ me the sweetest, most thoughtful, kind, witty, and amazing man I've ever met.\
  \  He was a genius. He always told me I was his intellectual equal, but the truth\
  \ was, he was WAY smarter than me.  He got me in every way.  He was my soulmate.\
  \  He was 15 years older than me but I didn't care...because I knew he was the man\
  \ God had chosen for me to spend forever with.\nIan grew up in a Christian home,\
  \ but as most intelligent people do, he had his doubts. I often told him he was\
  \ too smart for his own good, and he simultaneously admired and begrudged me for\
  \ my ability to believe.  Time and pain wrenched Ian away from God, and from an\
  \ early age he was a self-proclaimed atheist. He hurt for 30 years. He tried to\
  \ drink his pain away, came near death, and kept on living because God wasn't ready\
  \ for him yet. He was a miracle.\nKnowing you have the answer to someone's pain\
  \ if they would just accept it is torture, and it poisoned me every day I watched\
  \ Ian hurting. The drinking was bad when we met, worse than I imagined. He got better\
  \ because I made him happy superficially, but I could not heal him. He needed God.\
  \ I prayed with all my heart every day that his eyes would be opened and he would\
  \ let God carry his burdens.  The pain of watching him hurt himself was becoming\
  \ overwhelming and I was at a loss for what to do. He had his literal come to Jesus\
  \ moment while I was on a trip to my hometown and he worried himself into thinking\
  \ I wasn't coming home.  \n \nIan quit drinking, and was a Christian when he died\
  \ a week later.\n \nWe will never understand God's plan.  I used to think God saved\
  \ Ian for me.  I never expected to get such little time with him.  I still don't\
  \ quite understand why God gave me everything I'd prayed for just to yank it away.\
  \  I was so angry for so long.  Years later, I still break down into tears when\
  \ I talk to God.  When I first moved back to Illinois, leaving the house in daylight\
  \ was crushing.  Going to work, taking care of other people, felt like walls were\
  \ closing in on me and it was all I could do not to hyperventilate.  I began to\
  \ realize that working full time was no longer in the cards for me.\nI used to be\
  \ a slave to work.  The job was hard, I didn\u2019t make much, and I worked weekends,\
  \ holidays, and whatever shift they needed me for because I was always the person\
  \ who said \u201Cyes.\u201D   When I lived on my own, I worked so I could afford\
  \ my apartment, and worked more to pay for a car...so I could drive to work.  After\
  \ Ian died, I could no longer stomach this.  Spend less, work less, play more. \
  \ The summer after Ian died was a leap into the unknown for me.  I stayed with my\
  \ grandparents and did housework to earn my keep.  I worked within walking distance\
  \ so I didn\u2019t have to have a car.  I discovered train travel and loved everything\
  \ about it.  I made new friends, visited old ones, and learned how to get to Florida\
  \ for 30 bucks with just a personal item full of swimsuits.  I became a Google Local\
  \ Guide in multiple states.  Slowly but surely, life had purpose again.  I made\
  \ my peace with God.  My experiences opened my eyes enough to see that a person\
  \ can have 2 soulmates in life.  I now travel with that soulmate as he goes place\
  \ to place for work.  I love the thrill of a new place, even if it\u2019s just a\
  \ suburb in Michigan.  I eat. I drink. I am merry.   Life is short!  And I\u2019\
  m determined to make the most out of every minute of it.  That is my leap into the\
  \ unknown."
