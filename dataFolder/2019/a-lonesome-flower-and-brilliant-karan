Text: "\u201CCan it sense me being vigilant about not to fidget and try to be a good\
  \ passenger? Is it trying equally to be smooth and nice too? Do they have that much\
  \ of intelligence to establish a fair symbiotic relationship with humans?\u201D\
  \ \nI clutched on to the reins as my horse, Karan, who stepped diligently through\
  \ the little pebbles and muddy track. He was the shortest tawny horse out of all\
  \ the stock that our family was riding on. Dad\u2019s horse Sallu (yes, christened\
  \ after Salman Khan) was leading the way followed by mine, then my sister\u2019\
  s Arjun and at last my mother\u2019s Bahaadur. \nEven though being twenty feet away,\
  \ I could hear the horse owner, a resident of the land popularly known as the \u2018\
  Paradise on Earth\u2019 answer to my mother; \n\u201CNahin madam ji koi firing nahin\
  \ hoti gharon mein, yeh sab Media ka kaam hai. Aap aaye aur khud hi dekha Kashmir\
  \ aapney. Humko takreeban dus saal ho gye yahaan basey, hum sab khush hain. Kabhi\
  \ koi museebat nahin hui, meri bhi do betiyaan hain.\u201D He jogged along with\
  \ a mild hunch back and wearing a green karakul, occasionally stroking his beloved\
  \ horses on which we rode.\n\u2018Meri bhi do betiyaan hain,\u2019 this sentence\
  \ rung in my head. I was sure to have heard the same sentence twice before. Once\
  \ from our taxi driver,another from a local shopkeeper and it was accompanied with\
  \ a gentle pat on my head which I thought to be very heart warming. \nThe track\
  \ got steeper as our troupe charged ahead. I had almost sliced open my lip from\
  \ apprehension when I saw my horse taking up a heavily rugged path when a levelled\
  \ one was few steps away out of its sight due to blinkers. A nanosecond later I\
  \ was relieved and positively challenged on my notions regarding this animal\u2019\
  s intelligence as it circled around to trot on the latter track. \u2018Nicely done\
  \ Karan!,\u2019 I congratulated him in whispers as figuring out how much low of\
  \ a decibel can these animals actually hear up to.  I tried to shake off my head\
  \ to get off this constant mental conversation (known as jouska) out of my conscious\
  \ but it just intensified.\n I spotted big mountainous crows which I recalled were\
  \ believed to be introduced by a person named \u2018Kirpa Shroin\u2019 for funeral\
  \ rites in the Kashmir valleys. Which is sort of unreasonable as crows are found\
  \ to be one very continent only excepting Antarctica. Hmm. My thoughts darting across\
  \ the scenery like little coloured ping-pong balls shooting from everywhere targeting\
  \ my  tiny head.\nOh, the damp soil. I scrunched my nose on the sight of it. Akbar\
  \ used to call this place his personal garden and the last wish of Jahangir is known\
  \ to be a famous monosyllable, \u201CKashmir.\u201D So probably on the soil on which\
  \ we\u2019re passing by were once stepped on by these rulers themselves? And perhaps\
  \ during their hunting sessions one of the rulers would have stopped to obey his\
  \ nature\u2019s call? Nope,the soil couldn\u2019t be damp from it. It was quite\
  \ a long ago. I inhaled the fresh fragrant air noisily. \nIt struck me so clearly,\
  \ the moment I stepped out of my airplane and the fragrance of the land hit me so\
  \ overwhelmingly. Every land, every home, every person is known to have his/her\
  \ typical cologne. And this land\u2019s cologne was especially very robust and upfront\
  \ about itself. With the innumerable population of minute white flowers dominating\
  \ every inch of land that wasn\u2019t already a road, a strong aroma was intended\
  \ to prevail. \nMy vision soon fell upon a single lonesome tiny purple flower growing\
  \ in the mud while the rest of them were blooming in the luscious green grass just\
  \ adjacent.It was a brief exchange of not more than half a second as we were passing\
  \ through the trail, but a question fixated my mind with utmost importance, \u2018\
  does the flower growing in the dirt experiences any kind of discrimination from\
  \ its fellow flower-mates which grow in the greenery?\u2019\nI tried to shut out\
  \ my thoughts thinking it lives only the vegetative life. \nBut still, does it?\n\
