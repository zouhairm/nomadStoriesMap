Text: "Hi I am Indonesian. The story of the experience my friends and I had when we\
  \ traveled to India 3 years ago. When my friends and I travelled to India we got\
  \ invited to a chicken party by my Indian couchsurfing friend called Abassi. Although\
  \ it was odd, I recalled that Indonesian culture does not allow us to reject the\
  \ offer from stranger as taught by our great grandparents. Hence, my friends and\
  \ I accepted the offer and we followed Abassi in the dark and crowded night from\
  \ Pink City to Amber Fort. \n\nAs I hadn\u2019t imagined I could meet Indian Muslim\
  \ family, I was so excited to meet Abassi\u2019s mother with an amazing cultural\
  \ Indian dinner with Chai masala tea, chicken biryani and finished with jeera, a\
  \ small herbal made from cumin.\n \n \u201CSakiraa\u2026\u201D\n\nMy imagination\
  \ moved to Abassi. Ouh! My heart was like \u201CThis Indian man is totally my type.\
  \ His Tall body and dark skin reflect his hardworking character\u201D.\n\n\"Sakiraa\u2026\
  \ we arrived!\u201D he wobbled his head.\n\nSimultaneously I stopped my imagination.\
  \ There was only dark area around large field and only 2 houses around me. My friends\
  \ insisted on staying inside tuk-tuk and gave me a code to go ahead. Only one lamp\
  \ was turned on over the right side where my Indian friend continued to go.\n\n\
  I followed him as the first Indonesian girl to enter the villager house. It was\
  \ Cement floor, brick and wall around. There were 3 men squat down around Indian\
  \ traditional stove. \n\n\u201CLet\u2019s get out from here.\u201D Screamed my friends.\n\
  \nEveryone stood up and inadvertently my body followed them. As we walked out leaving\
  \ the place, one girl friend pretended to be ill and nosebleed. This moment, I couldn\u2019\
  t do anything except following my travel buddies to go away from this scary place.\
  \  Everyone seemed frightened and disappointed. Thank God the tuk-tuk was still\
  \ there and we went back with the same tuk-tuk. \n\nOn the way back to hotel stealthy,\
  \ we made conversation via WhatsApp.\n\n \u2018He is stupid. He wanted to kill us.\
  \ How could he bring us in dark place like that\u2019? Shouted the Girl. \n\n\u2018\
  This is because Sakiraaa! She is also stupid, why did she want to follow that Indian\
  \ fool?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Let\u2019s call the police after we have arrive in hotel\u2019\
  \ shouted the other girl\n\nI hadn\u2019t known that conversation until I was informed\
  \ about it by another friend. I cooled myself down with positives vibes because\
  \ I had not thought that Abassi could scam us. The goodness he did to me led me\
  \ to affirm that he could not scam us  given that he had helped us a lot and guaranteed\
  \ with his citizen ID and took us in his house. No. \n\n\u201CThis is impossible\u201D\
  \ I said.\n\nOne hour after, we developed a negative mindset. Mostly, girls getting\
  \ scared and I was the one who punished. The boys trying to be gentlemen and pretend\
  \ to keep the girls (except me) from that dangerous moment. \n\nOur last day in\
  \ Jaipur was terrible. The Indonesian stay in negative mind about Abassi without\
  \ clarification. Without their permission, I met Abassi in airport five minutes\
  \ before my flight back to Indonesia.\n\nOh my love!\n\nI finally shook his hand.\
  \ Before, I never wanted him to touch on me. That was automatic gesture that happened\
  \ after he told me about the miscommunication between us. \n\n\"I used chicken party\
  \ with European but they were always okay with that situation.\" He said while looking\
  \ my eyes deeply.\n\nAs Indian he born in Asian, just because he used to hang out\
  \ with Europeans, so the dark place would totally be okay for him. He used to situate\
  \ the dark place to Asian, specially 6 Indonesian girls with 3 boys. By all means,\
  \ Abasdi did stupid things. Somehow, he taught us how Indian culture was but what\
  \ a poor guy! He cannot understand guest culture."
