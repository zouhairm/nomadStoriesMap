Text: "It felt weird and kind of laughable to see the presents with their jazzy wrapping\
  \ paper I had brought for the kids in that plain and messy yet homely room. Everything\
  \ in the room, from the kitchen table to the quiet medicinal herbs on the windowsill,\
  \ seemed to be upside down. It was Easter and arrangements of the last minute were\
  \ going on all around that small cottage in a forgotten spot of the Irish countryside,\
  \ and I found myself in the middle of it.\n\nI was living in Dublin at the time,\
  \ an Italian abroad like many others, and Teo had helped me find a place I could\
  \ call home during my stay. Being polite, he had also invited me to spend Easter\
  \ with him, his family and some friends of theirs. I had never met any of them.\
  \ They all lived in the countryside near Feakle, a little village in the West. That\
  \ was the farthest I had ever been into the heart of Ireland. \n\nI had spent the\
  \ afternoon of the day before searching little presents for Teo's three kids. With\
  \ that purpose, I had carried myself into one of the main shopping areas in Dublin,\
  \ Henry Street. It was the Saturday before Easter, so it was even more crowded than\
  \ usual. Everybody seemed to be a little happier and excited in that busy afternoon.\
  \ The colors seemed brighter too \u2013 yellow jackets, green hats, red balloons,\
  \ even the gray street itself, while noises of all kinds came from every corner.\n\
  \nThe next day was Easter and I took my bus on the riverside, all packed with the\
  \ gifts, and left the gray sky and empty gray streets of Dublin early morning, heading\
  \ to green inland Irish countryside, which made a huge contrast with the busy life\
  \ of the city. A quick stop at Teo's place gave me the chance to give the presents\
  \ to the kids and meet his wife, Tomi, a beautiful Japanese woman with a deep look\
  \ into her eyes. Then we all left the ramshackle cottage and reached their friends'\
  \ bigger and more sophisticated cottage.\n\nI was feeling uncomfortable, rather\
  \ melancholic. I had traveled all the way from Dublin to spend Easter with people\
  \ whom I had never met before and who were going along with each other so well and\
  \ so effortlessly that they could have easily passed for one huge colorful noisy\
  \ family. I felt like an intruder. The realization that they were approaching me\
  \ as one of them only reached me when the salad was served. It was just a regular\
  \ salad: green leaves and dressing, and yet it filled me more than any other dish.\
  \ The vibrant color and replenishing rough earthy taste of the leaves encompassed\
  \ all the care of those people for their daily work, for their children, their friends\
  \ and their earth.\n\nThere was music after lunch. We were sitting around the table\
  \ sipping coffee, the children playing around the room, when the host, P\xE1draig,\
  \ started playing his fiddle. A silence filled with expectation followed, than his\
  \ Japanese wife, Rika, joined him with her accordion. The guests played along: Teo\
  \ with his guitar, Tomi with her fiddle, Bern with his tin whistle while all the\
  \ others sang and clapped their hands. Even all the unusual instruments hung on\
  \ the walls seemed to reverberate during that intimate yet collective moment.\n\n\
  Eventually, it was time for me to leave. Thinking back to the day and funny as it\
  \ sounds, the salad had changed it all. It had filled the empty place between the\
  \ jazzy wrapping paper, the ramshackle cottage and the music. The salad made me\
  \ feel at home. While thinking so, I couldn't help but thinking about those who\
  \ were struggling more than me to call home the foreign land they had reached, the\
  \ place I came from and that I call home: Italy, my country. And with these heavy\
  \ thoughts in my mind, when I had almost reached my place, I saw her suddenly: the\
  \ homeless Irish girl always wrapped in her sleeping bag outside the grocery store\
  \ reading her thick book. She too had to struggle, and yet seemed serene: no housing,\
  \ but home."
