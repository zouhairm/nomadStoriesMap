Text: "I woke up between ferns and moss. I had told my friends that in New Zealand,\
  \ you could sleep in a forrest, naked, and be completely safe. If you are not in\
  \ a region with sandflies that is. Here, at the West Coast of the South Island,\
  \ were a few sandflies. The spray proved not to be very efficient. But I did it!\
  \ I slept outside! Ferns, and moss and glaciers just around the corner! I put on\
  \ my clothes and walked and breathed and soaked in the beauty that is New Zealand.\
  \ Clean air, moderate climate, friendly people. I had met Tom and Mike and Eva at\
  \ a backpackers near Franz Josef and I wanted to see them again. Franz Josef isn't\
  \ one of the other travellers ... it's the glacier. The huge body of ice curling\
  \ through the curves between the mountains, unfar from the ocean, palm trees, waterfalls\
  \ and the rain forrest. I had never seen such diverse landscapes all in a few kilometer\
  \ radius.\nWe took the car to Pukekura. The road was small, one lane sometimes,\
  \ even over bridges that spanned over a wide river bed. The rain was pouring. Every\
  \ now and then, Mike said, the river grew so big that it washes a cow away from\
  \ its meadow and floats it into the ocean. We were hungry and curious. 'What do\
  \ you think possum tastes like?' Eva said. We had heard of a spot where they served\
  \ pies with a filling that came from the small rhodent that had conquered New Zealand\
  \ and multiplied so quickly that you could probably make fur coats for all of Oceania\
  \ just from the possums of the South Island. Unfortunately, possums loved bird eggs\
  \ and therefore threatened quite a few of New Zealand's most vulnerable species.\n\
  'I don't know', said Tom, who was a local, 'but it better be good.' \nIn some parts\
  \ of the road the water was knee deep. The car made it splash up over our windows.\
  \ This was the heaviest rain I had ever seen. Mike spotted a giant sandfly: There\
  \ it is! The Bushman's Caf\xE9!\nWhat would it be like to try possum ...? \nWe felt\
  \ this interesting feeling that grabs you, when you eat a meat that you don't usually\
  \ eat or when you consume it in a way you usually don't. The whole weirdness of\
  \ meat eating suddenly unfolds in front of you, even if you generally eat meat.\
  \ And this place won't allow for you to forget where meat comes from. Their 'museum'\
  \ displays all sorts of dead animals and killing methods combined with cruel humour.\
  \ We looked around. We were barked at by an unfriendly owner. There was no doubt\
  \ that the general atmosphere of the place wasn't an ironic, humourous approach\
  \ to wildlife. Step by step by step we left the place of dead deer and dignity and\
  \ continued our trip to Ross for a great cup of coffee, a sandwhich and another\
  \ night under the stars to come."
