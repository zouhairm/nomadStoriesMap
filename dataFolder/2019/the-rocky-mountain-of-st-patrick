Text: "Suddenly there's this vast wave of humiliation washing over you as you're about\
  \ to make the first step onto the path. The mountain is proudly spreading above\
  \ you, inviting you into its unexplored embrace. Although this isn't the highest\
  \ mountain you've ever climbed, you can certainly tell it won't be the easiest one\
  \ either. Rocks, mud and green grass covered with tiny pearls of last rain are the\
  \ main ingredients the path to the top is made of.\nDeep breath in and out and off\
  \ to go. First few steps seem to be easy so you start thinking it won't be too bad\
  \ after all. But then your breathing becomes heavier and the first drop of sweat\
  \ appears on your forehead. Clear sign to stop, re-hydrate yourself and admire the\
  \ view behind which is getting more adorable with every passing meter upwards. Every\
  \ time you turn your back, more green land reveals itself underneath, forming itself\
  \ into \"U\" like embrace hugging the cold blue waters in a small bay. \nSlightly\
  \ about an hour later you finally reach the top. But than you realize that this\
  \ isn't the final destination of your journey. It's just a middle ground between\
  \ the village down below and the real top of the mountain hiding itself in the clouds.\
  \ Maybe if it was a sunny day and not the usual gray day with a strong wind and\
  \ clouds scattered low to the ground, you know, just the other typical day in Ireland,\
  \ the mountain wouldn't be able to play tricks with you. Well, at least it's not\
  \ raining. So you decide to take a moment and observe what this \"resting\" place\
  \ has to offer for your admiration.\nThe bay is now almost wholly revealed, stretching\
  \ out its waters wide beyond the horizon where they're welcomed into the cold hold\
  \ of Atlantic ocean. When you turn around, a completely new view lays in front of\
  \ you. A look down into a green valley surrounded by hills, some smaller than the\
  \ others, but all together protecting this hidden gem from everyone who's not willing\
  \ to put any effort into discovering it. But those who did, had left their messages\
  \ written in a stone font all over the valley. And you just must admire how it shows\
  \ the perfectly soft human touch in this wiled piece of nature.\nNow it's time for\
  \ you to turn right and face the other half of the way up. It starts nice and easy\
  \ as it did at the very beginning but you don't let it comfort you this time. The\
  \ fog has fallen onto the path so you can't actually see much farther than just\
  \ two meters ahead. The more shocking is the moment when you finally spot the real\
  \ nature of the final quarter of the journey. All you can see is one rock piling\
  \ on another and then again and again, forming itself into enormous hill climbing\
  \ high into the clouds at incredibly sharp angle. This isn't something you have\
  \ expected to find here, nor is the group of people making their way up ahead of\
  \ you. Well, you knew there would be other people making this trek but you probably\
  \ imagined them having some shoes on their feet.\nYou're fighting the urge to turn\
  \ and go back down into the village. But this story would never be complete if you\
  \ did that, so just take another deep breath in and move on. It takes you another\
  \ hour or so to get to the top. You're out of breath, your thighs sore after all\
  \ the jumping from one rock to another but the sense of satisfaction beats it all.\
  \ The view is amazing. For a single bright moment the sunlight makes its way through\
  \ the clouds, shining upon the beautiful land down below, showing you an astonishing\
  \ part of country on the edge of Atlantic ocean. Everything looks so perfect in\
  \ that moment but then the clouds overpower the sun again. \nThis is Ireland but\
  \ it's also the way how the life works. It's not always easy but it's usually worth\
  \ it and it's about the ability to cherish all the bright moments that's been given\
  \ to you."
