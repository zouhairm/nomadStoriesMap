Text: "I awoke to the heady fragrance of a petering tropical storm. Kieren and I were\
  \ curled around a damp puddle of bed. Rain pitter-pattered and birds chitter-chattered.\
  \ I felt fresh, despite the rain\u2019s rude awakening hours earlier.\nKieren was\
  \ less serene. I noticed as we tiptoed barefoot to breakfast. It was unsurprising.\
  \ My day was mine. He had work. He\u2019d been working in Vanuatu sporadically for\
  \ 3 years. I'd joined him months before in the capital, Port Vila.\nWe tucked into\
  \ breakfast in a rickety hut on the island of Tanna. The leaky roof and nibbling\
  \ rats sharply contrasted to Port Vila\u2019s resorts and restaurants. \n\u201C\
  What are your plans?\u201D Kieren asks between bites of baguette, an appreciated\
  \ legacy from the pre-independence Anglo-French condominium. \n\u201CHiking to the\
  \ Giant Banyan Tree!\u201D \nSince arriving, I\u2019d been keen to hike yet repeatedly\
  \ dissuaded. I\u2019d heard rumours unmapped trails crisscrossed the islands, but\
  \ you must somehow seek permission from local chief\u2019s in advance. Stories circulate\
  \ of attacks on women. \nHeads shook at hiking, so I\u2019d been delighted to hear\
  \ of opportunity, while watching children\u2019s silhouettes laughing among purple\
  \ waves.\n\u201CWait, I can walk!?\u201D I questioned Kieren\u2019s colleague Paul\
  \ between kava shells. Kava is the Ni-Vanuatu drug of choice - a calming drink made\
  \ from roots of the kava plant. \n\u201CYes, it takes a few hours.\u201D\nAt first,\
  \ it seemed it would take hours to find the track. Ni-Van\u2019s are notoriously\
  \ bad at directions. They refer to non-specific things, like \u2018mango trees\u2019\
  , as landmarks.\nWhen I finally found the track, I consequently desired constant\
  \ reassurance. \n\u201CIs this the way to The Giant Banyan?\u201D I asked a curious\
  \ boy teetering on a bicycle.\nI repeated the question to a lady carrying a machete\
  \ and baby, a pack of machete-wielding children who shyly trailed me and a laughing\
  \ farmer watching them.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 everyone replied, \u2018just follow the\
  \ long road.\u2019\nThe long road climbed through tropical food gardens, beneath\
  \ vibrant red \u2018Christmas\u2019 trees and glimpsed silent nakamals. Nakamals\
  \ are rickety benches bellow banyans where men drink kava at dusk.\nFinally, a crudely-painted\
  \ wall announced: \u2018The Giant Banyan\u2019.\nA scraggly-dressed teenager led\
  \ me up further still. He spoke in broken English. I hadn\u2019t yet learned Bislama,\
  \ which is a pidgin mix of French, English and 112 indigenous languages. \n \u201C\
  U from where? U gat Facebook?\u201D\nHe swatted away questions, instead asking about\
  \ plants and animals in Britain. My answers shocked him.\n\u201CNo bananas!\u201D\
  \ \nWe arrived at the banyan. I frowned. It was pretty, but not large. \n\u201C\
  This is nice,\u201D I remarked politely.\n\u201CThis is the male,\u201D my guide\
  \ chuckled, \u201Cthere\u2019s the female.\u201D\nI realised the canopy cloaking\
  \ the valley was just one tree. We zigzagged down. I gazed in awe at gnarled, knotted\
  \ branches, twisted into ladders. If you\u2019d the nerve, it\u2019d be the ultimate\
  \ playground. \nI swung like Tarzan. My guide asked questions.\nI pulled out my\
  \ phone to show him my home. \nGoogle Earth sent his jaw agape. \n\u201CMy village\u2026\
  !\u201D He was shocked by the powers of the internet. \u201CWe are on there!\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CThat\u2019s how I found you.\u201D \nI flicked to Trip Advisor. He gasped\
  \ at his snotty-nosed siblings smiling back at him.\nHe saw the internet was more\
  \ than Facebook. Facebook is free in Vanuatu. Many view Facebook as the internet.\
  \ \nAs we laughingly lolloped back, the smiling siblings appeared. He excitedly\
  \ pointed to my phone screen. They guffawed and giggled in glee. \nMy guide ran\
  \ to retrieve his phone. I squinted at the broken screen. My \u2018hotspot\u2019\
  \ let me repeat the \u2018magic\u2019.\nAt the entrance, his mother waved us to\
  \ her mat. She was similarly entranced. He disappeared, then returned presenting\
  \ the longest papaya I\u2019d ever seen.\nI promptly dropped the fruit. We shrieked\
  \ as it hit the grass. A plastic bag was presented - a luxury in a country which\
  \ banned plastic bags. \n\nI added him on Facebook, waved goodbye and skipped smiling\
  \ down the long road hugging my smushed papaya. \n\nIt was my turn. My jaw dropped\
  \ at the verdant sprawl of foliage which dipped into the peaceful sea far below.\n\
  To see the Earth from a distance was a shocking luxury here. A distant land in the\
  \ flesh was a shocking luxury for me."
