Text: "As my shift in handing out food packets to Syrian Refugees ended, I grabbed\
  \ my jacket and decided to hit the streets. The corner of Jordan I was in isn't\
  \ known for getaways or tourist beats; it's a hard place for a beautiful people.\
  \ After being in country for 3 days, I wanted to see the real Jordan. As I passed\
  \ the Mosque from which my 4 a.m. wakeup Fajr blared, I saw a graveyard. I was taken\
  \ to it, almost forced, by the cold desert winds that chapped my lips daily. \n\n\
  Crossing the street, as the hills opened up, I saw 5 small boys playing soccer.\
  \ I grinned. As soon as I walked up, the boys understood. They always do. Shouting\
  \ in Arabic at me to join the far-side, they demanded my credentials. \"Amriki?\"\
  \ \"Messi?\" \"Ronaldo?\" The grin was widening on my face as I replied \"Afriki.\"\
  \ \"Messi.\" Their confusion shifted to pleasure, then delight, as I pulled my few\
  \ twists and turns out of my bag, scoring a hat-trick. As we shared water from my\
  \ bottle, I looked back around the graves, and froze. Two tall men decked in all\
  \ black stared at me, hovering over my backpack. \n\nI jogged over, fear gripping\
  \ my gut. I didn't have my papers, and I had heard stories of foreigners being accosted,\
  \ even arrested, for tiny offenses. I smiled at the two men. They didn't return\
  \ my smile. \n\nPointing at my pack, the shorter man grunted something in Arabic,\
  \ then English \"Amriki?\" The taller man waved me off. Pulling his phone out of\
  \ his black leather jacket, he typed slowly. Then wordlessly revealed his question\
  \ to me, via Google Translate. \n\n\"Would you come to my house and take coffee?\"\
  \n\nI grinned, although this time it felt forced. Quickly drawing out my own phone,\
  \ I responded in kind. \"I would be honored to take coffee with you, God Willing\"\
  . His grin looked genuine. As we marched back across the cemetery and into the street,\
  \ my fear returned rapidly. Close to the border as we were, with constant gunshots\
  \ reminding us of the war in Syria, ISL was never far from my mind. An even larger\
  \ man, with the stereotypical beard and black robes, was waiting. He marched up\
  \ to the three of us, and began a tirade in Arabic. This continued for several minutes,\
  \ until he looked straight at me and said \"Welcome to Jordan, peace be upon you\"\
  \ in near flawless English. My jaw dropped, and then we all laughed. \n\nCoffee\
  \ with my friends was a quiet affair, punctuated by laughter as we read one another's\
  \ questions off phone screens. We passed the phones, coffee, and cigarettes with\
  \ abandon, until the shorter man stood up, and announced (through the phone) \"\
  Please come to my friend's restaurant for dinner.\" We walked the way we came, until\
  \ the edge of the graveyard showed a large tent, reminding me of a Middle Eastern\
  \ Circus. \n\nWe entered, and I saw rows of chairs, but no tables. We took seats\
  \ near the middle, and quickly I was brought dates and coffee, served by 10 year\
  \ old boys, giggling as I thanked them profusely. My friends were engrossed in conversation\
  \ with other arrivals, and I sat. Finally, in an attempt to engage with the growing\
  \ rows of men, I typed \"whose's your favorite team, Madrid or Barcelona?\" He typed\
  \ back \"Madrid, but time for no fun, this is funeral\". My brain stopped, as all\
  \ the pieces finally fit together. A restaurant with no food on a cemetery. All\
  \ black garbed men who frowned constantly. My friend continued\n\n\"And as the guest\
  \ of honor, you will have to speak.\"\n\nAlthough not my first time to address a\
  \ crowd whose language I lacked, I tried to cobble together a speech I hope did\
  \ justice to a life lived, and unknown. \n\n\"Abdullah was a man of powerful standing.\
  \ The crowd tonight proves that. May peace be upon his family, and they find joy\
  \ in death, and honor in life\"\n\nI soon staggered from the Tent, high on emotions,\
  \ cold from the wind, hyped from the coffee. I passed through the graves a final\
  \ time, reminiscing on death, honor, and joy."
