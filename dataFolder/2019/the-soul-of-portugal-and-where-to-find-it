Text: "I traveled to Lisbon a year and a half ago. In the ride to my hostel from the\
  \ airport, I was stunned by all the color and beautiful architecture that gave Lisbon\
  \ its undeniable character. I had never seen a more vibrantly painted town. The\
  \ warm air made me smile and I could hardly wait to explore this paradise by the\
  \ sea. \n\nI began to do what I did anywhere. I met a few travelers in my hostel\
  \ and I asked them about what stood out most in their stay. I had to know the must-sees\
  \ and must-dos of this new and exciting place.  \n\n\"Oh it's amazing, you have\
  \ to visit the old part of town, there's winding pathways and street art. It's gorgeous!\
  \ And of course, try Pasteis de Belem.\" \n\nI became so enchanted with the city\
  \ that I entertained the idea of living there. I had just finished my last quarter\
  \ of college and I didn't have anything really tying me back home. I thought working\
  \ in such a beautiful place would just about be the experience of my life. So I\
  \ asked a few of the locals what life was like in Lisbon. I didn't want to hear\
  \ about beaches or pastries. I wanted to know what day-to-day life was like. \n\n\
  I came to know that, much like my hometown of Seattle, all that made the city wonderful\
  \ was disappearing. From a few accounts, I gathered that local Portuguese people\
  \ were migrating out of the city and renting out their apartments and houses via\
  \ Air BnB. Lisbon began turning into one big hostel, where tourists flowed in and\
  \ out with the season, and regular people moved to the outskirts. From the outside,\
  \ Lisbon seems to retain its culture, language, and customs of its people given\
  \ how it looks. However, the insidious effects of overtourism were sure to start\
  \ showing with time. \n\nIt's not obvious now and the energy in the city is still\
  \ vibrant and incredible. To be sure, it is still my favorite city to date. I think\
  \ in hindsight, if I had more time, I would like to explore the daily lives of people\
  \ there in more detail. I only caught glimpses from short, passing conversations\
  \ but I think understanding this city and the surrounding area would make a fabulous\
  \ story. It is the details and personal anecdotes that can bring a story like this\
  \ to life."
