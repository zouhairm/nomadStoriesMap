Text: "I meet them for first time here, I feel like met them before. Over years I\
  \ heard a lot about them in my country because we had connected history, war phrase\
  \ history. Something that I knew well by history study, teachers and others before\
  \ I decided to be here, meet them in real life, Japanese.\n\n\u201Cexcuse me, do\
  \ you know this?\u201D I showing her my printed hotel details, she opens her phone\
  \ then starting to find the exact position based on the address with I dont know\
  \ what apps she used and she ask me to following her then guides me the direction\
  \ that not far away from where we stand to Sakura Hostel. With her body language\
  \ she shows me that I just following the main street until passing 4 blocks then\
  \ turn left and that\u2019s all, we will arrive in Sakura Hostel, \u201Cahhh...thankyou\
  \ so much\u201D my quick respons for her helps  then reflex nodded my head (Indonesian\
  \ behave) as thankful and respect for her kindness and she replays me the same behave\
  \ like what I did, I\u2019m little bit feel like home even she is a stranger for\
  \ me in Tokyo.\n\nIn the day after tomorrow, I meet Hana. Owner of my hostel in\
  \ Fuji, she is so kind to me and starting to know about where I came from. \u201C\
  bbbrrr..so cold in the outside, I\u2019m freezing\u201D I telling my boyfriend at\
  \ the moment we arrive in hostel after doing day trip, \u201Coh really? Yeah, in\
  \ this area is cooler than Tokyo\u201D Hana respons me, \u201CIn my country, we\
  \ never feel low temperature, everything is hot in Indonesia, like summer along\
  \ the year, just rain and sun\u201D I start to telling her the big different of\
  \ our countries, because Hana told me that I am the first Indonesian guest in her\
  \ hostel, majority came from the 4 seasons countries and spend some nights there\
  \ for hiking Mt.Fuji, so it would be interesting when she has tropical visitor like\
  \ me that freezing in her area. In the next day, when I wanna going outside for\
  \ another day trip around Fuji, Hana give me some present. She gave me cute pens\
  \ with little girl that wear kimono in top of the pens, then give my aunty sakura\
  \ chain key, and some candies for my boyfriend, I dont expect anything, the hostel\u2019\
  s owner give the guest gift without any special moment. \u201CThis is so beautiful,\
  \ thankyou so much Hana, you are so kind\u201D then Hana ask me for potrait my family\
  \ with her polaroid, 2 times takes, one for Hana and another photo for me, then\
  \ she give me another surprise \u201Cthis is will make you warm, you can use it\
  \ in hand or anywhere you need the most\u201D I see it and try to understand what\
  \ it is, but I still dont understand because in the packaging just show Japan word\
  \ characters, I dont know how to read it but I still understand that it will make\
  \ me warm in the middle of coldest day in my life. Again, it feels like home, like\
  \ meet Indonesian that have tradition giving something to guest like snack, hand\
  \ gift or souvenir. Hana, best women that I knowed in Fuji.\n\nThen I tried to use\
  \ Hana's present, it works very good and then I try to searching what it is, binggo!\
  \ It's heat packs. I\u2019m truly touched why they are so kind to me, the stranger\
  \ in their country. In the same time, I never feel like stranger here, so familiar\
  \ because people in my country, Indonesian have same behave culture to treat others,\
  \ I\u2019m so enjoy travel around Japan, because Japanese treat others as kind as\
  \ possible, stranger or not, everyone are the same. They keep me feel comfort in\
  \ any situation, anywhere, anytime. Japanese reminds me of home."
