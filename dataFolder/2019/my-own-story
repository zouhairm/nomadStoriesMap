Text: "We are blessed with intellect and vitality of mind to explore the depth of\
  \ the universe. For me, to unveil intrigues of the emerging world; learning and\
  \ sharing; while being down-to-earth, for social service describes best my interest.\
  \ Having felt several hardships throughout my life due to belonging to a minority\
  \ from a remote area, my ultimate aim is to serve my fellowmen and lead them to\
  \ an advanced world as much as possible. Pursuing Software Engineering reflects\
  \ my objective of how to serve the nation. I have aimed at reaching the highest\
  \ platform of my field, experiencing innovations, afterward serve my countrymen\
  \ and facilitate them with Computer Field. I have endeavored on my level best at\
  \ University level to emerge as a leader. Besides being engaged with my related\
  \ field of study, I have participated in several platforms to enrich my capabilities\
  \ of leadership. Alms360, Thardeep Society, Evaluation Testing Services, Study-Corners,\
  \ GlowMash, Full Opportunities are some recent activities which have imparted maturity\
  \ level of social circumstances and dealing with public clouds. It is what our society\
  \ needs at most in the current time. I believe, such an opportunity will help me\
  \ energize youth to move ahead for a glorious life. Only well-educated youth can\
  \ make a nation\u2019s growth possible."
