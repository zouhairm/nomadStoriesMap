Text: "\u201CHello, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201D A persian girl approached\
  \ to me at Immam Square in Esfahan. She\u2019s wearing a turquoise hijab and a smile\
  \ on her face. \u201CMy name is Fatima, I should talk to a tourist to improve my\
  \ english. Do you have time?\u201D I turned to face my parents and after their approving\
  \ nod, Fatima led me to a park bench that was oriented towards the Sheikh Lotfollah\
  \ Mosque. \u201CMy sister is filming us, okay?\u201D, Fatima asked and I agreed.\n\
  \u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D, she started the interview with this question.\
  \ \u201CBerit\u201D, I answered.\n\u201CHow do you like my country?\u201D A difficult\
  \ question. After two weeks of backpacking through the country with my family, I\
  \ had experienced many wonderful moments: Eating saffron ice cream in Persepolis,\
  \ learning how to cook barberry rice from locals, enjoying the sunrise at pink mosque.\
  \ But I had also learned about Iran\u2019s politics, witnessed strict laws everybody\
  \ must follow, had seen the anti-aircraft missiles protecting the nuclear underground\
  \ lab in Natans. So I chose my words carefully: \u201CWe had a wonderful time travelling\
  \ through Iran!\u201D Fatima\u2019s smile told me that she was happy about my answer\n\
  \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D, she demanded. \u201CI\u2019m from Austria\u201D\
  , while answering, I already knew, what would come next. \u201CAustralia! What a\
  \ beautiful country!\u201D \u2013 \u201CNo, Austria, in Europe. Our capital city\
  \ is Vienna!\u201D, I replied. People often don\u2019t seem to recall my tiny country\
  \ at first. The Persian girl took a moment to think about my words: \u201COh, Austria!\
  \ My cousin\u2019s friend lives in Vienna... Do you think that Austria is similar\
  \ to Iran?\u201D Laughingly, I shook my head: \u201CNot at all. There are many differences,\
  \ I feel like Persians are more hospitable than Austrians.\u201D That was true,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t imagine that many Austrians would invite tourist home for a cup\
  \ of tea or give them a tour through half the city to lead them to the best restaurant\
  \ in town. Both were situations we had experienced more than once in Iran.\n\u201C\
  So you don\u2019t think we are terrorists?\u201D, Fatima wanted to know. \u201C\
  Not at all! I met so many wonderful people here in Iran!\u201D I thought about Ava\
  \ with her heart-warming smile in Shiraz, our tour guide at \u201Cunderground city\u201D\
  \ who introduced us to the world\u2019s best coffee, brewed for 48 hours with rose\
  \ water and cardamom, Natasha who had explained the \u201CAshura\u201D ceremony\
  \ to me\u2026\nFatima reached out and touched my purple scarf. I hadn\u2019t noticed\
  \ it had slipped off my head. Her turquoise hijab was perfectly in place. Only a\
  \ few strands of hair had fallen out, placed too perfect to be on accident. \u201C\
  Oh, not again\u201D, a bit embarrassed, I put it on my head again. Although it was\
  \ surprisingly comfortable to wear, I wasn\u2019t used to wearing a hijab at all.\n\
  At this point her sister had put the camera away and joined us: \u201CAre you married?\u201D\
  \ What a question to ask! The shock must have been written on my face because the\
  \ girls looked at each other nervously. \u201CNo, I am just 18!\u201D Fatima replied\
  \ with sympathy: \u201COur father wants us to finish university first and he even\
  \ lets us choose a husband on our own.\u201D What a cultural clash! Except for being\
  \ my aunt\u2019s flower girl five years ago, marriage was so far away for me, I\
  \ hadn\u2019t even thought about it yet. And those two girls considered themselves\
  \ lucky to not be married yet at age of 19.\n\u201CBut now I\u2019ve got a question\
  \ for you: How do you like Iran?\u201D, I asked them. Fatima answered after a moment:\
  \ \u201CIt is my home, I love it. But there are things that should change. I want\
  \ to choose if I want to wear Hijab, be able to laugh out loud and meet with my\
  \ female and male friends in public! That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to university,\
  \ to learn how to change things here!\u201D\n\u201CBerit, we gotta go! Otherwise\
  \ we won\u2019t be able to visit the Immam Mosque at sunset\u201D, my mum interrupted.\
  \ After a quick good-bye, Fatima leaned over one more time and said: \u201CTell\
  \ your friends at home, we are no terrorists!\u201D\n\u201CFor sure, I promise you!\u201D"
