Text: "Too many days, I finish up work already focused on things I have to do at home\
  \ or just wanna get away from the maddening crowds. Then there are days when I get\
  \ reminded of why I\u2019m here in the first place .  When the thing that was missing\
  \ at those times when I feels something is missing but just can't quite pinpoint\
  \ it, is now in front of me. I'm in the middle of it, living it. No explaining myself\
  \ or to myself as the clarity of it is undeniable.\nIt would have been one of those\
  \ U-Bahn rides which tend to be a prime example of dull. Yes, the very same ride\
  \ that was new, fast-paced and exciting when I was in a \u201Cdating phase\u201D\
  \ with the city. Such commutes, packed with sad-faced people, really make me doubt\
  \ my decision of making a big city my temporary residence.\nI\u2019ve decided my\
  \ last cents would go to the guy playing a couple of catchy but hearty singalongs.\
  \ With my singing, I seemed to be as much a part of the performance as he was. Then,\
  \ just as my stop was coming up, he was to play 'Feeling Good' by Nina Simone: \u201C\
  Well ain\u2019t that just the song I need to hear right now!\u201D I slouched into\
  \ the nearby seat, made myself real comfortable, gazed up to where the stars should\
  \ be and listened to him butcher the song for another two or three stations. It\
  \ was awful. I should have been rolling my eyes but I couldn't help simply smiling.\
  \ One can only spoil a classic to a point. Whatever change I\u2019ve had in my pocket,\
  \ ended up in his beat-up mandolin case. As an add on I offered a cheese crusted\
  \ bagel, which he denied. His bag could have been full of food already, as he claimed,\
  \ or perhaps he was vegan and didn't want to seem ungrateful.\nStepping off the\
  \ train I found myself at an unknown station. In the distance, a promising graffiti\
  \ was grabbing my attention so I flew down a flight of stairs while pirouetting\
  \ around a slow walker, avoiding the smell of stale piss, only to be caught by a\
  \ breeze that pushed me towards a piece of street art. The day was over with me\
  \ just yet, however. The breeze strengthened to a wind that guided me onto another\
  \ street where I found myself a bit at a loss on where to turn. The neon lights\
  \ from nearby shops and falafels, the streets lights and car lights all reflected\
  \ in the puddles of the afternoon torrential rain. The air was cold and crisp. I\
  \ was in no hurry to go home. Looking up and down the street, I spotted signs of\
  \ life through a nearby window. My explorer instinct kicked in, ushering me inside\
  \ a through a door, hoping to find that Skatalites album I was grooving to last\
  \ night on the other side. I flipped through various covers and various prices,\
  \ trying to find my champion, looking around to locate someone more knowledgeable\
  \ than myself. \nI found him in the form of a perfectly ordinary gentleman behind\
  \ the counter. What was to follow surprised both of us. Not so much what we were\
  \ talking about but the way we acknowledged each other as human beings, rather than\
  \ a means to an end. What was only to be a simple question about having a certain\
  \ record, turned out to be a meeting of kindred spirits. A meeting of two generations,\
  \ starring at the age gap between them, knowing full well of its vastness yet still\
  \ going forth with laying down the cornerstones of the bridge of mutual respect.\
  \ It was in this very record shop I was once again reassured that Berlin, despite\
  \ its ways of bringing me down, is a place I belong to while at the same time being\
  \ that missing something I could not pinpoint."
