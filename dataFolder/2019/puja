Text: "I met the guru in Mumbai. I was visiting my friend Gautam who had recently\
  \ become a devotee and based on what he told me, I decided to meet the holy man.\
  \ I grew up watching Bollywood movies about Mumbai\u2019s gritty underbelly and\
  \ the guru sounded like the archetypal Bollywood con man. I persuaded Gautam to\
  \ take me to him. \n\nThe guru\u2019s residence stood at the end of a seedy lane\
  \ in Mazgaon \u2014 an area notorious for criminal activity. The narrow street was\
  \ replete with old, sunburnt, two-storey buildings and rusted shanties. We entered\
  \ a large gate covered with fluorescent yantras and walked across the veranda to\
  \ reach a massive hall. A plywood table and an old armchair with faded upholstery\
  \ were its only furniture but the walls were covered with pictures of Naga Sadhus,\
  \ portraits of Jimi Hendrix and framed posters of Max Roach brush-stroking a snare.\
  \ The living quarters were to the left of the hall and the temple was at its centre.\n\
  \nThe guru sensed my incredulity as soon as we entered. Wisps of black hair streaked\
  \ with grey fell across his face and he gave me a sharp-eyed look. Gautam tried\
  \ to introduce me to the guru but he stopped Gautam with a wave of his hand and\
  \ told us to follow him to the temple. His powerful, rotund body moved at a steady\
  \ gait as we walked behind him. We had arrived just in time for puja. \n\nA crowd\
  \ of devotees gathered outside the temple. The guru asked me to stand inside the\
  \ sanctum sanctorum. He wanted me to \u201Cwitness first-hand.\u201D I stood next\
  \ to a six-foot idol of the goddess Kali in front of which sat a shivling and yoni\
  \ \u2014 all three were placed on an elevated platform of black stone. Oil lamps\
  \ and incense circled the shrine and I made a comment about moving the lamps in\
  \ case it rained. The sky rumbled with thunder all evening and the lamps were placed\
  \ under a gaping hole in the asbestos roof. \u201CNo need to move anything,\u201D\
  \ said the guru, \u201CI made a deal with Kali Ma. It won\u2019t rain until midnight.\u201D\
  \ He asked for the lights to be extinguished. The only luminance in the temple came\
  \ from a shaft of red light that fell on the idol from an overhead bulb. The guru\
  \ inhaled deeply and blew hard on a conch.\n\nThe ancient, wave-like sound reverberated\
  \ through the space and the puja began. The guru washed the goddess and the idols\
  \ with a mixture of milk, saffron and honey followed by rose water. The crowd started\
  \ chanting \u201CJai Kali Ma,\u201D and swayed side to side. One of the women went\
  \ into hysterics and screamed, \u201CJai Kali Ma!\u201D  The guru immediately had\
  \ an allergic reaction and yelled, \u201CShut up and concentrate,\u201D which halted\
  \ the freak show dead in its tracks. The afflicted lady was miraculously cured.\
  \ \u201CI have no tolerance for public hysterics and I\u2019m like a flamethrower\
  \ at quelling them. The only woman who gets attention here is Kali Ma.\u201D he\
  \ explained. \n\nAfter the puja, the guru attended to the people who needed his\
  \ help. I was given a seat next to him as this was my first time. Seated across\
  \ me was a broad-shouldered man with a striking face that wasn\u2019t conspicuously\
  \ handsome. He had moved from Delhi to Mumbai to realise his acting dream but struggled\
  \ to get work. The guru promised the actor he would get him a lead role in a Bollywood\
  \ movie . He claimed he had several \u201Chigh contacts\u201D in the Mumbai film\
  \ industry.  The actor was saturated with hope and joy. He touched the guru\u2019\
  s feet and asked for his blessing. \n\nWhen I got back home, I couldn\u2019t stop\
  \ thinking of the guru. I wanted to meet him again. This Kali-worshipping, Jazz-loving\
  \ holy man of Mazgaon didn\u2019t possess the contrived piety blatant in most self-proclaimed\
  \ gurus in India. As I was getting ready to go to bed, bolts of lightening blazed\
  \ across the sky followed by heavy, noisy rain. I looked at the time, it was a minute\
  \ after midnight."
