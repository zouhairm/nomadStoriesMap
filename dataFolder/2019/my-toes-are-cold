Text: "It took hours \u2013 planning the routes, measuring my luggage to make sure\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t have to pay the extra \xA36 to board a budget flight, checking\
  \ if it\u2019s the right airport \u2013 before I mindlessly click \u201CAgree\u201D\
  \ (potentially consenting to a secret spy mission) and key in my payment details\
  \ (praying it goes through), that\u2019s it: I bought my tickets to Europe!\n\n\
  We woke up in a quiet housing area of Vienna, the natural sunlight peering through\
  \ the sheer curtains. It was a cosy, old, rooftop room with icicles hanging by the\
  \ sides of our tiny window (of which I have to tiptoe in order to look out of, but\
  \ to also watch out for the ceiling that is lower at that part of the room; every\
  \ once in a while, we would hear a random \u201Couch!\u201D). The breeze of the\
  \ cold wind, you can even hear it \u2013 oh wait, that\u2019s just the pipes. Just\
  \ like Cindy Lou Who, awakened by the presence of Christmas spirit, I noticed something\
  \ small (but sparkly), gentle (but astonishing), translucent (but breath-taking):\
  \ snow.\n\nSnow. Who would have thought that it\u2019s the perfect element to set\
  \ the right romantic atmosphere, but I\u2019m jumping ahead of myself.\n\nThe sight\
  \ of snow might be familiar to this part of the world; but to me, it was as mysterious\
  \ as the myths of Big Foot. Coming from a country where the four seasons are \u201C\
  hot\u201D, \u201Cvery hot\u201D, \u201Crain\u201D and \u201Cheavy rain\u201D, snow\
  \ was magical, intriguing, exhilarating. I grabbed my winter coat and my camera\
  \ (I think I brushed my teeth), opened the door and took a careful step into the\
  \ foreign and unknown: snow \u2013 I have watched a lot of videos of people slipping\
  \ on snow, I know the drill.\n\nI extend my arm, welcoming the aureate flake \u2013\
  \ resembling a beautifully orchestrated ornament \u2013 gently landing on my palm.\
  \ It was twenty minutes of feeling the fluffy goodness, throwing snowballs at my\
  \ boyfriend (and using my camera as a shield \u2013 \u201Cit\u2019s an expensive\
  \ camera, don\u2019t destroy it!\u201D) \u2013 and posing for photos before I thought\
  \ to myself: why are my toes so cold? Of course, my trainers weren\u2019t a good\
  \ fit for this weather. I suppose this is what happens when I pack for my trips\
  \ without mother nagging at me to bring the appropriate clothes, \u201Cyou ought\
  \ to bring your boots, dear\u201D (this is definitely the toned-down version of\
  \ a typical Asian tiger-mom). I should be able to handle some icy tingles on my\
  \ toes for a day \u2013 I was wrong. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take me long before realising\
  \ that I am not Elsa and that the cold truly bothered me, but the numbness in my\
  \ toes didn\u2019t stop me from sprinting across the yards of the Sch\xF6nbrunn\
  \ Palace, the usual greeneries now tucked under a blanket of pure white snow, to\
  \ avoid yet another blow of snow bullets thrown at my direction. We would laugh\
  \ and collapse in the snow (Is snow even clean? Who cares), naming our tiny creation\
  \ Mr. Snowman before gravity mercilessly decapitates its cute little slushy head.\n\
  \nWe took a stroll, pretending we were Crazy Rich Asians, casually looking for a\
  \ humongous palace to call our home. No one told me that a small slope would end\
  \ up being a slippery hike up Icy Town, an uphill battle that required much dedication\
  \ and focus. Perhaps I was too focused. As I was an inch away from the peak (and\
  \ by peak, I mean a mere five-minute crawl), I decided that showing off my triumphing\
  \ the frozen hill with a glorious smile would be necessary; as I cautiously turned\
  \ around \u2013 noticing now that the entire trek up has been eerily quiet \u2013\
  \ I see my 6ft heartthrob sliding downhill, his hands stretched forward as he tried\
  \ to regain his balance and momentum. The silence was broken with a burst of laughter.\
  \ \n\nWe continued our little excursion, this time hand-in-hand, and finally reached\
  \ the entrance of Caf\xE9 Gloriette, right at the tip of the cliff. We spent the\
  \ next few minutes glaring back into the adventure we conquered, as the white fairy\
  \ dusts continue to trickle on our coats \u2013 my toes were cold, but my heart\
  \ was warm."
