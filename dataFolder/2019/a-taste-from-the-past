Text: "Th\u1EA1ch Rau C\xE2u C\xE0 Ph\xEA?...I stared blankly at the dessert menu.\
  \ The scrambled letters and floating accents of the Vietnamese script were indistinguishable\
  \ to me. And yet, I remained in denial. My eyes fixated on each item, attempting\
  \ to do a \u201Cdouble-take\u201D and realize that I can read the words after all.\
  \  \n\n\L\LBut when I failed to decipher even the simplest of descriptions, I ran\
  \ my finger through the list and for no particular reason, settled for Th\u1EA1\
  ch Rau C\xE2u C\xE0 Ph\xEA. That one should do. I don\u2019t know what it is, but\
  \ I\u2019m excited to find out. \L\L\n\nThe street vendor nodded at me and then\
  \ to my astonishment, handed me a plate of coffee-flavored jello with alternating\
  \ layers of dark brown and coconut white layers. It was covered with condensed milk\
  \ and rested on a bed of ice. \n\n\L\LI recognized it immediately and steamy tears\
  \ started to form and trickle down my face. That\u2019s the same dessert that my\
  \ dad made for me the night before my sinus surgery when I was 10 years old. Attempting\
  \ to cheer me up and ease my pre-surgery nerves, my dad stayed up all night painstakingly\
  \ setting each layer of coffee, coconut, and milk-flavored jello so that I would\
  \ wake up to a colorful, 3-tiered surprise.\L\L\n\nHow did I not know this dessert\
  \ is called Th\u1EA1ch Rau C\xE2u C\xE0 Ph\xEA? And how do I pronounce this?\L\L\
  \n\nAs I took my first bite, the bitterness from the coffee flavor seeped into the\
  \ complex memory of my family\u2019s past. When a massive famine swept through South\
  \ China in the early 1930s, my grandfather fled and walked barefoot through the\
  \ mountains of southern China into Vietnam. \L\L\n\nDecades later, after settling\
  \ down, my father was born in a war-torn Saigon, ravaged by years of illegal trade,\
  \ prostitution, and relentless bombing from the Indochina and Vietnam War. So at\
  \ the tender age of 13, my father also fled, escaping briefly to a refugee camp\
  \ off the coast of Malaysia, before finally making his way to the United States,\
  \ where I was born.\L\L\n\nAnd now I am combatting the traumas of our history to\
  \ come back and reconcile our past. \L\LWe are an estranged people. Each generation\
  \ has moved farther and farther away from our ancestral home and each generation\
  \ is now wedging an even greater cultural and linguistic chasm between each other.\
  \ Torn between being Chinese, Vietnamese, and American, I am left with shreds of\
  \ what could have been a shared culture and language with both my father and grandfather.\
  \ \L\L\n\nAll this leaves me is a strange hybrid with a motley of conflicting experiences.\
  \ I speak Cantonese but not Vietnamese. I grew up with Vietnamese desserts instead\
  \ of Cantonese desserts, but I don\u2019t know what they are called.\L\L\n\nI have\
  \ returned back to my father\u2019s place of birth but have never felt more foreign,\
  \ except for the rare occasion when I discover a dessert, a conversation in Cantonese,\
  \ or an article of clothing that brings me back to the most cherished memories of\
  \ my childhood. I carry an intimate love for this place as well as a deep, unsettling\
  \ sadness. I am both at ease and anxious, and feel accepted but equally rejected\
  \ at the same time. \L\L\n\nThe nagging uncertainty of who I am parallels the history\
  \ of a country and people that have been forever changed by natural disasters, mass\
  \ emigration, and war. But embedded between the alternating layers in the Th\u1EA1\
  ch Rau C\xE2u C\xE0 Ph\xEA is also the layered history of my family\u2019s escape\
  \ and return and the attempt to build sweetness from the coffee-flavored bitterness\
  \ of our past."
