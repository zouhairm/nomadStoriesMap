Text: "A while ago, I boarded a flight and came over to a country that\u2019s 12.5\
  \ hours apart from all the people I love. And vice versa. It was a leap into the\
  \ unknown. How do I feel? I don\u2019t know. These days will turn into months and\
  \ will eventually turn into years. I guess, I may still not know how this move makes\
  \ me feel. \n\nHere I am trying to give a tangible form to what inside of my head\
  \ looks like right now. This is from the eyes of a new comer in this country while\
  \ I am still being able to look around with that silly wonder on my face, while\
  \ I still can get excused for not knowing how it is \u2018supposed\u2019 to be for\
  \ most of the things. \n\n1. \u2018I am grateful for the unspeakable telepathy of\
  \ loved ones and strangers alike\u2019\n\nSomeone I was talking to the other day\
  \ mentioned how I might be super scared and unsure right now but I will be just\
  \ fine. These Canadian Rockies take care of everyone eventually. Of course, that\
  \ was just the symbolism of the higher power that\u2019s going to make sure I get\
  \ to experience the rose petals along with thorns on my path. One of the strange\
  \ ways I have found that happening is in the low moments of my trying to push through,\
  \ there have been external knocks reminding me, I am not actually alone. Even though\
  \ the days and nights might be reversed or I may not know even a single soul in\
  \ this city, there have been times when I am in tears and a random guest in the\
  \ house I stay in has asked me to come watch TV with him. Or it\u2019s in the middle\
  \ of the (Indian) night, I\u2019d get a Facetime call. There are these unique ways\
  \ that make hopping over that moment easier. And it\u2019s only a moment that is\
  \ usually the most difficult to go past, right?\n\n2. \u2018Just do the next 24\
  \ hours well\u2019\n\nIn between swinging from past to future to past, I feel torn\
  \ apart. Because my past in no aspect is going to be in comparison to my future.\
  \ From seasons to culture to food to experiences, it\u2019s all new. Better or even\
  \ better? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s in fact, strange because I don\u2019\
  t have a reference point for any of the comparatives. I hear people saying, the\
  \ warmer winter, the tastier Wendy\u2019s burger, the better Sale season. I\u2019\
  d usually just pass on a smile in such conversations because there is still some\
  \ time before I start living my life in comparatives here. Until then, shall we\
  \ just do the next 24 hours well?\n\n3. \u2018It isn\u2019t a unicorn\u2019\n\n\
  When I was back in India, everything about this faraway world would fascinate me,\
  \ lend a twinkle to my eyes, as if everything on this faraway land is going to be\
  \ perfect. No doubt, it\u2019s pretty and fancy but it\u2019s no unicorn. I experience\
  \ real emotions of jealousy, gluttony, self-doubt, exhaustion, just like I would\
  \ back home. There are adult and mature things of taxes, laws, politics, weather\
  \ and all things that aren\u2019t as pretty but just real. But yes, if I just dust\
  \ off that realness, the sheen of the unicorn does make my 6 year old self, my folks\
  \ back home happy. And if that doesn\u2019t fulfill my purpose then what does, right?\n\
  \n4. \u2018Notice the easy to miss moments\u2019\n\nI have fallen prey to the human\
  \ tendency of trying to convince myself that nothing\u2019s changed even when everything\
  \ around me changed. So, it\u2019s usually in these tiny moments that pop up, subtly\
  \ yet loudly remind me of this change. Sometimes for good, others may be not. But\
  \ here\u2019s a reminder to catch onto those easy to miss moments the next time\
  \ I hold a Tim Horton\u2019s coffee or I pack blackberries as my mid morning snack.\
  \ Or when I casually walk around the house in my pajamas while it\u2019s -23 degrees\
  \ outside. There is enough warmth in those moments. And if I can let that warmth\
  \ give me company, I should be fine, right?\n\nUntil then, onward and upward!"
