Text: "Slowly click-clacking out of the Fonte Bonifacio Spa Park and onto the brick\
  \ sidewalks of Fiuggi, I breathe in the crisp evening air before lugging myself\
  \ and gear back to the Hotel Imperiale. A strange sight for the locals, I\u2019\
  m sure, as most people who leave the park supposedly feel reinvigorated. But I\u2019\
  m not \u201Cmost people\u201D \u2013 I\u2019m a disheveled foreigner trudging through\
  \ the square of this mountain village in a silver tuxedo vest. Taking advantage\
  \ of my low profile, I waddle on\u2026staying out of everyone\u2019s way. That much\
  \ I can muster.\n\n\tTraveling to Italy (my first time!) with my family and a group\
  \ of models for an international competition, I aimed to make a good impression\
  \ on behalf of my country. To ensure that I could combat any negative ideas about\
  \ Americans, I created a few tenets for myself based on studious research:\n\n\u2022\
  \tLearn common words/phrases \n\u2022\tSmile & politely defuse miscommunications\n\
  \u2022\tWear muted colors\n\u2022\tNO FLIRTING \u2013 stay focused on the work at\
  \ hand\n\u2022\tWatch the locals and adjust based off of their behavior\n\nThe raised\
  \ nail gets hammered. Ignoring prophecies of me \u201Cfinding my future wife\u201D\
  \ and focusing on documenting the models\u2019 journey through the week, confidence\
  \ surged through my body as I boarded my plane. It only took anxiety 2 days to replace\
  \ it. \n\n\tWilling myself back to my hotel, the gelato cart outside of Gran Caff\xE8\
  \ Michelangelo catches my eye. I forgot to get my first scoop the last time I was\
  \ there with a few of the models. In my defense, we had to hurry off in order to\
  \ catch our bus to Rome. That happened a lot: delays in communication, last-minute\
  \ change-of-plans, finding out where our participants were and where they needed\
  \ to be. Add to this taking pictures and recording each of the competitions\u2026\
  not even my little black book of Italian info could fend off the daily rapids. \n\
  \n\tThe constant dance of avoiding offense was the most demanding of all: seeing\
  \ the servers and appalled patrons murmur as we run off before being served, apologizing\
  \ to the owners of a pizza-burger joint for inebriated models who unknowingly toppled\
  \ their stacked chairs at close, me accidentally calling someone a pig while trying\
  \ to say that I don\u2019t eat pork. Between the swells of missteps, I relished\
  \ any little glimmer of positivity. I often played table tennis in the hotel courtyard\
  \ with my youngest sister. Each day, I would notice a kind smile amongst a sea of\
  \ listless expressions. One reliable smile in particular\u2026\n\n\tThe glow of\
  \ the hotel\u2019s entrance off my dress shoes surprises me. Those haunting memories\
  \ really quickened my steps! Popping techno music and an open bar welcome me into\
  \ the empty lobby. I pass through and scale the stairs. Sprawled out on my too-cozy\
  \ twin bed, I mope and browse Netflix for a bit. Suddenly\u2014\u201CAh! Gelato!\u201D\
  \ Slipping by the models and guests starting to trickle in, I make tracks for that\
  \ long-awaited confection.  Stracciatella didn\u2019t disappoint and my cone didn\u2019\
  t make it back to Hotel Imperiale. Again, I flop onto my bed and fire up Netflix.\
  \ My head softly bobs, but not because of the mindless scrolling. \u201CIs that\
  \ Drake?\u201D\n\n\tI recognize \u201COne Dance\u201D pulsing through the walls.\
  \ By some weird magic, I find myself in the now-packed lobby clutching a cup of\
  \ Grey Goose. \u201CBillie Jean\u201D comes on and I start moonwalking on carpet\
  \ surrounded by a semicircle of people. I can\u2019t explain what exactly came over\
  \ me, but I do know that I didn\u2019t want to sulk anymore. I chose to just enjoy\
  \ myself\u2014no inhibition. And then it hits me: the flash of that reliable smile.\
  \ That timely reminder to not allow the difficulties of this trip to consume me,\
  \ but to, instead, stay open. Following the urge, I greet her only to learn that\
  \ she doesn\u2019t speak English. Not discouraged, I listen to the Latin beat now\
  \ thumping and look at her. \u201CBachata?\u201D She takes my hand with one of her\
  \ signature grins. And to think that I nearly missed this chance by staying in my\
  \ room. God bless you, Drake!"
