Text: "Today, I am twenty-three years old. Yet, I can recall the Summer that I was\
  \ twenty vividly. I remember because it was the first time I went to Europe. The\
  \ first time I was solo-backpacking. And, because I was falling in love. \n\n\t\
  It was June and I had already been traveling for a few weeks. So, when I arrived\
  \ in Porto, Portugal, I was worn out and sick. Thankfully, my hostel greeted me\
  \ with a shot of strong port wine and a cozy bed where I would quickly fall asleep\
  \ for the night.\n\n\tI woke up in the morning still slightly ill but also refreshed.\
  \ At breakfast, I found a couple of women who had the same plan as me: Lie on the\
  \ beach all day. We decided to get ready and meet in the same spot in 30 minutes\n\
  \nWhen I came back down there were a few more people waiting with my new friends\
  \ and a book on the table, Paper Towns by John Green, one of my favorites. I asked\
  \ who was reading it and a guy who looked to be about my age said he was. He had\
  \ his curly hair up in a bun, a nose piercing and a big smile. He introduced himself\
  \ as Mat\xEDas. Immediately, I felt oozy with feelings.\n\nAs we all walked to the\
  \ beach, I found myself falling in love with the feel of the charming old city,\
  \ with its colorful buildings and many cobblestone streets. And, at the same time,\
  \ Mat\xEDas kept asking me questions and telling me about himself. He told me he\
  \ was going to university in the Midwest, the same region I\u2019m from. He told\
  \ me that his mother was from Spain and his father was from France. And, he enthusiastically\
  \ shared about his passions. \n\nOnce we made it to the breezy beach, Mat\xEDas\
  \ and I built a sandcastle, jumped in the waves and ate ice cream. By the end of\
  \ the day, he had already invited me to visit him in a month at his grandparents.\
  \ I said maybe. \n\nThe next night was a huge festival in the city called S\xE3\
  o Jo\xE3o. Everybody at the hostel walked to the big, gorgeous old bridge looking\
  \ out over the river and city. The streets were packed with people carrying their\
  \ drinks and soft, plastic hammers, knocking strangers on the head, as it is traditional\
  \ in Porto for this festival. After sunset, we walked off the bridge and down to\
  \ the banks with all the locals and watched fireworks. That\u2019s when Mat\xED\
  as and I would share our first kiss. It was a magical night that would end with\
  \ us watching stars on the roof of our hostel. But, as with all great travel romances,\
  \ the night would also end with us saying goodbye as Mat\xEDas had a flight out\
  \ in the morning.\n\nThe next day, some new friends would convince me to skip my\
  \ flight back to Barcelona to instead travel by train to Lisbon, a city where the\
  \ vibe is best described as \u201Ccool.\u201D From there, I would head down to the\
  \ stunning South coast of Portugal and all across the South coast of Spain, eating\
  \ tapas and drinking sangria along the way. Finally, at the end of July, I arrived\
  \ in the unique city of Valencia. From here, Mat\xEDas picked me up with his family.\n\
  \nHis grandparents lived in a pueblo next to Valencia. They had fruit trees and\
  \ an outside oven where they made giant dishes of paella for their lingering family\
  \ dinners. We drank horchata and literally danced under a fig tree in the moonlight.\
  \ At this point, I was falling deeply in love.\n\nYet, as the story goes, we said\
  \ a teary goodbye at the airport. And, I would sob once I got through security.\
  \ The next day, I would arrive in New York City and turn twenty-one. My Summer was\
  \ officially over.\n\nMat\xEDas and I would keep in touch, trying to recreate the\
  \ magic of that Summer, but eventually decided to remain only friends. \n\nToday,\
  \ I am glad to think of Mat\xEDas in this way but I am also happy that I\u2019ll\
  \ have the memory of the Summer I was twenty forever."
