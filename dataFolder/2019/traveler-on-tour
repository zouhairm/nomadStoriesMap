Text: "I did not expect\u2026well, I didn\u2019t expect much from the group tour,\
  \ honestly.  My travels had always been cobbled together on a shoestring and off\
  \ the beaten track. Tour groups were for vacationers seeking curated, catered experiences\
  \ free from the challenges that make life interesting: incompatible currencies,\
  \ dodgy taxis, midnight arrivals in remote towns shuttered by obscure religious\
  \ festivals.  Tours were for tourists, I thought dismissively: I was a traveler.\n\
  \nBut I was also tired!  I had crammed in too many dream destinations into the few\
  \ months I had available.  Near Lake Baikal, after weeks of organizing my own solo\
  \ travel in new countries and new languages, I realized I would reach the Chinese\
  \ border long before I would get a visa.  So I booked another flight and the group\
  \ tour\u2014Saigon to Bangkok by bicycle.  How bad could it be?  After all, if the\
  \ rest of the group were pampered and boring, I could always go my own way.\n\n\
  Except it turned out that the other people on the tour were significantly better\
  \ at bicycling along the winding boardwalks linking villages and rice paddies. Once\
  \ we left paved roads behind, I usually found myself at the tail end of the group,\
  \ sloshing through monsoon puddles under vivid orchids and leaves as large as my\
  \ wheels.  Occasionally, I lagged so far behind that someone\u2014the English newsreader\
  \ on holiday or the retired Australian businessman\u2014would be dispatched to lead\
  \ me out of the jungle to rejoin the waiting group.  The other bicyclists took on\
  \ this extra task cheerfully.  A cyclist from Spain suggested that it was fortunate\
  \ I was so slow.  Speeding past small villages, he and the faster members of our\
  \ peloton were met by cheering schoolchildren running alongside, shouting encouragement.\
  \  \u201CThe little ones are too small,\u201D he said. \u201CBy the time they reach\
  \ the roadway, we are already gone.  But then you come along and give them something\
  \ to see!\u201D\n\nAs we biked out of the tropical lowlands and into Cambodia\u2019\
  s foothills, I adopted this positive outlook.  Slow or not, I was seeing new places\
  \ in a way that was new to me. I had snobbishly assumed my travel companions would\
  \ be apathetic, but they were full of unique insights. Two, an Australian businessman\
  \ and a pilot from Kansas, had both worked in Asia.  One explained culturally appropriate\
  \ greetings.  The other offered tips for getting that Chinese visa.  The newsreader\
  \ turned out to have keen bargaining skills, which she deployed to good effect at\
  \ food stalls.  One eerie night, in a guesthouse that was empty except for our tour,\
  \ we told ghost stories from around the world while a monsoon poured outside.  Another\
  \ day, our Vietnamese tour guide allied with the American and Australian travelers\
  \ to give the Europeans an abridged history of the Vietnam-American War years. After\
  \ hearing our multinational account, the Spanish man declared it disrespectful to\
  \ go to Choeung Ek, the Killing Fields memorial, in his cycling gear.  I helped\
  \ him purchase a tie at a night market; the newsreader taught us the necessary vocabulary.\
  \ \n\nIn my own gaudy Spandex, I couldn\u2019t be anything other than a tourist\
  \ on this trip, even with the pooled knowledge of my group.   We were all strangers,\
  \ together.\n\n\u201CHow old is this?\u201D  I asked our guide when we stopped for\
  \ a water break beside a jewel-box temple decked with leering dragons.  It was set\
  \ in a lush copse, a weathered Buddha in the courtyard.\n\n\u201CVery old,\u201D\
  \ he assured me vaguely, concerned with getting us all to Thailand before the afternoon\
  \ rain.\n\nOn my own, I could have stayed longer, would have brought guidebooks,\
  \ learned an exact date. But on my own, I would never have reached that temple at\
  \ all. Surprisingly, I found tour group travel helped me be content with a glimpse,\
  \ like a child by the roadside. As a tourist, as a traveler, all I really needed\
  \ to know about that Cambodian temple was evident in the moment: that it was beautiful\
  \ and peaceful and a good place to stop for water with friends."
