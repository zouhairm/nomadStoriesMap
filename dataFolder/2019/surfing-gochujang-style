Text: "I gingerly walked barefoot onto a sidewalk Italian restaurant, hungry for papardelle\
  \ with what the menu promised was organic, island-grown pork. I had lost my sunglasses\
  \ and flipflops somewhere between the islands of Guyam and Daku, which was fine\
  \ because it was night, and it wasn\u2019t strange for people to walk the streets\
  \ of the island barefoot. The server, Marie, shooed me off the large table I had\
  \ chosen and onto sectional seating, where the old couple beside me promptly and\
  \ huffily stood up to pay.\nI sat, alone and contented, already full with the scene,\
  \ the warm lighting, a giant husky soliciting ear rubs from diners, the charm of\
  \ early evening wine on a far-flung island. I saw a tall Korean guy, his longish\
  \ hair framing eyes that were frowning at a menu, and then at Marie who was gesturing\
  \ he move seats too, beside mine.\n\nI observed him dive into his Bolognese with\
  \ gusto as I poked at my piping-hot pumpkin polpette. Since Koreans discovered kimchi,\
  \ I offered him some of the red pepper flakes I had asked from Marie. He accepted\
  \ with delight.\n\nHe was in Siargao for just over a week, to learn surfing; he\
  \ worried it was too long. I told him after he had taken his first wave, he would\
  \ find out a lifetime will never be enough. He would like to go fishing, which he\
  \ learned from his appa, and preferred walnut (pronounced wha-root) wood best for\
  \ the furniture he makes. I told him I worried about tourism on the island, which\
  \ had been exploding after Boracay closed. He smiled gently at my ranting, and somehow,\
  \ things seemed better than they were.\n\nAfter dinner, he said that he would like\
  \ to see me again. I dutifully wrote my name and lodging on his travel notebook,\
  \ and I smiled, sparked by this erstwhile company, which he returned, self-assuredly\
  \ and generously, before he motored off into the night.\n\nThe next morning, he\
  \ surprised me in my tent while I was reading the Dhammapada, cross-legged and bleary-eyed.\
  \ We drank hot chai with milk and honey I had packed in an old spice bottle, as\
  \ we watched the sun rise on a peerless blue sky, over a still cerulean sea. We\
  \ paddled out to sea on boards, trading wide smiles as we overcame gentle waves\
  \ that threatened to tip us over, as we passed over meadows of pristine, jewel-toned\
  \ coral reefs, when we fell into the warm water and he tied his board to mine. There\
  \ was a wooden deck in the middle of the sea, where we rested, bare-chested and\
  \ bright with the prospect of seizing this tiny spar for our own.\n\nI took him\
  \ to my favorite patisserie on the island, and he laughingly took a picture of me,\
  \ ecstatic with drool over a nutty Paris-Brest and a crisp chocolate choux. We strolled\
  \ on the boardwalk looking out over the world-famous Cloud 9 break, and I took his\
  \ pictures on his camera. He asked if I had a girlfriend or maybe, a wife; I said\
  \ no. I pondered his question, before a surf instructor tapped us on the shoulder\
  \ asking if we wanted lessons.\n\nHe insisted on driving me back to my place on\
  \ his scooter; I had never learned how to ride a bike. I was caught, unaware and\
  \ inexplicably, by sadness and joy. What was this feeling now? \n\nIt was like the\
  \ first afternoon on the island as I was watching the sun set, turning the landscape\
  \ immensely larger and more real than it already was, the golden light expanding\
  \ each particle of sand, the waves that broke on the shore, the ingenuous laughter\
  \ of the island-children white against their tanned, somersaulting bodies. I was\
  \ taking a photograph that could never fully capture the moment.\n\nIt was here,\
  \ as I sat behind him, trading smiles on the rearview mirror and as he perilously\
  \ looked back to see if I was okay. We stood to the side of the road, and said goodbyes.\
  \ His smile was wider than ever; mine was slight as moonlight. We didn\u2019t hug,\
  \ nor even shake hands, but somehow this person had touched me."
