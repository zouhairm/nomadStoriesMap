Text: "Dubai is the middle gateway between Africa, Europe and the Far East. Though\
  \ Dubai is known as the hustle and bustle of the UAE (United Arab Emirates), Abu\
  \ Dhabi is in fact the capital and the locals who are known as, \u2018Emiratis\u2019\
  \ make up only 25% of the population - not many people know this. The Both emirates\
  \ attract plenty of tourists and have an ever-expanding expat community, bringing\
  \ fresh new talent and different perspectives to the region, making it another cultural\
  \ melting pot.\n\nThe number one motivator for expats moving out here is pretty\
  \ black and white; the money (mostly tax free salary), the sunshine and to have\
  \ a better quality of life. Those were my particular reasons of working there for\
  \ a while\u2026 Oh and to pick up a bit of Arabic \u2013 'Shukran'.\n\nHowever,\
  \ Dubai is rapidly becoming this new super cultural hub. I\u2019m not talking about\
  \ the museums and bus tours. More and more international artists are now performing\
  \ in Dubai or Abu Dhabi, the new Dubai Opera is a fantastic and there are some really\
  \ cool theatre festivals like Short + Sweet by DUCTAC, Dubai Shopping Festival,\
  \ Dubai Design Week. I\u2019ve also discovered quite a few quirky hubs available\
  \ for eccentric, cool art enthusiasts. Places like Alserkal Avenue \u2013 an industrial\
  \ creative space that's very similar to Hackney Wick (in East London, UK). There\u2019\
  s an individualistic cycling group called Fishtail Rides, who cycle around Al Quoz\
  \ and around the hidden gems of the city. Incorporating activities and events that\
  \ create unique and tasteful experiences for every route. SOLD! Another creative\
  \ collective, SOLEDXB supported by the Dubai Design District, have placed an urban\
  \ platform showcasing enthusiasts in fashion, music, art and lifestyle. If you want\
  \ to get away from the mainstream, the district Al Quoz, located in central Dubai\
  \ is the place for all-round enthusiasts of the sophisticated urban lifestyle. A\
  \ lifestyle that most are not exposed to in Dubai, but curious about and which excitedly\
  \ reminds me of home back in London, Shoreditch. Uber-cool, cultural and all round\
  \ creative with the cutting-edge Middle Eastern ambience. A niche and thriving lifestyle\
  \ that is set to blossom beyond its\u2019 years. Goodbye Barasti\u2026 hello Al\
  \ Quoz. \n\nDubai definitely has a soul that not many people are familiar with.\
  \ There\u2019s so much more than meets the eye. I honestly recommend expats and\
  \ tourists to dig deep beneath the beach resorts, trendy bars, glitzy shopping malls\
  \ and shiny skyscrapers. Beyond the horizon, you can experience a beautiful, culturally\
  \ diverse city with lots to offer for everyone. From young and middle-aged families\
  \ to professional singletons, whilst basking in the stunning Arabian sea, to the\
  \ authentic flavour of Old Dubai."
