Text: My life was turned upside down when my boyfriend, Jey, broke up with me. I was
  shattered and this left me feeling alone. I remember crying myself to sleep and
  nothing seemed to make sense. Before the break-up, my boyfriend and I had been planning
  to take a trip to the Andamans. Well, clearly that wasn't happening anymore. But,
  being an adamant girl I couldn't let anyone ruin this trip for me and decided on
  a whim to go on this romantic trip alone. I was so motivated by all the heartbroken
  movies and all which helped me into thinking I come first and nothing is more important
  than self-love. It was impulsive but I am happy that I took the leap into the unknown.
  I got my much needed alone time and space to reconnect with myself. When I reached
  Port Blair, it was the first time since the breakup that I had stopped thinking
  about it and I felt a sense of pride. I was scared as it was my first time traveling
  solo, but here I was. I just thought of sitting in the beach, watching the waves
  and the sun, instead I rented a scooter and explored the inner depths of the island,
  did scuba diving, danced with strangers. As days went by I was more relaxed and
  liberated. This trip allowed me to see life from a different perspective. The heartache
  seemed less significant. I ended up making new friends and trying new cuisines.
  At the end of the trip I felt empowered and less heartbroken. This proved that traveling
  can do wonders. So, sometimes we should just take the plunge into the unknown.
