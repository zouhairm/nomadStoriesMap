Text: "A Leap into the Unknown\n\nLife as it may, at the worst of times, can reveal\
  \ the best of blessings. We travel because we seek the unknown. We must know what\
  \ is on the other side. We crave adventure. Not every story goes as expected or\
  \ planned but, I believe in telling it anyway. \n\nMy travel story begins in Bangkok,\
  \ Thailand. December 2016. My husband and I excitedly boarded the plane at Mumbai.\
  \ This was going to be our first international trip after three years of marriage\
  \ and we had meticulously planned out every detail of the itinerary right from the\
  \ local cuisine we were going to seek out, the flea markets and the fireworks we\
  \ were going to enjoy on New Year\u2019s Eve. \n\nI distinctly remember the touchdown\
  \ and feeling unusually exhausted. I desperately needed a nap. We reach our Airbnb\
  \ and I crashed. My brave husband decides to make the best of things and goes in\
  \ search of a snack to cheer me up. He returns with a minced pork lollipop and local\
  \ mango. I take one bite and ask him to leave the room. The smell of the food was\
  \ overwhelming and I couldn\u2019t figure out what was happening. Was I down with\
  \ a bug? After all, the biggest reason for us visiting Bangkok was the plethora\
  \ of exotic local snacks and here I was, being strangely repelled by it. \n\nThe\
  \ next day got worse. I was exhausted all the time and grew nauseous after sundown.\
  \ I had also missed my period and grew suspicious. Was this what I thought it was?\
  \ \n\nI purchased a pregnancy test from the local pharmacy and was half amused to\
  \ discover that all instructions on the box were in Thai.\n\nIt\u2019s New Year\u2019\
  s Eve at five am in the morning. And I decide to take the plunge. So I get into\
  \ the shower and two blue lines appear on the test as my heart starts pounding.\
  \ 2017 sure was off to a bright, glorious start. A leap for us, into the unknown\
  \ world of parenthood filled with adventure of every kind. \n\nThe real journey\
  \ had just begun. It has been two years of navigating the ups and downs that motherhood\
  \ brings with it. My heart is grateful and even as I see my son grow and experience\
  \ the world around him, my heart yearns for more. More adventure. More discovery.\
  \ Greater revelation. \n\nMaybe, just maybe, I will sneakily check flight tickets\
  \ and set up alerts. Maybe I will update my top five destination list. Maybe, I\
  \ might just choose Portugal, or it chooses me."
