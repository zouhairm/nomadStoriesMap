Text: "After wandering for a while through the dark and mysterious streets of Catania,\
  \ finally the bus station. With my companion map already dented by the use, a backpack\
  \ and a wave of heat that ran from the tips of my toes to my nape, where the wave\
  \ spread in the form of an itch, almost making me laugh alone. \n\nExploring the\
  \ coast of Sicily was something unimaginable days ago, and which materialized from\
  \ an unpretentious idea that broke in the middle of a tedious work afternoon. A\
  \ little more than three hours on the Italian roads took me to the timid and warm,\
  \ and in such a way, the familiar city of Agrigento. The stay was made in a small\
  \ house, run by an old, very friendly gentleman, who was not inhibited by the language\
  \ barrier caused by my faulty Italian. \n\nThe next morning he prepared the breakfast\
  \ quite fondly and pointed to a large table on the porch where there were other\
  \ guests. In a few minutes and a portion of inhibition break, the conversation settled\
  \ with a language that felt a slight English turned Italian, but very pleasant and\
  \ full of enthusiasm, which was only interrupted as we realized the passing of time,\
  \ and the need for each one to follow their path. The house owner gave me instructions\
  \ on how to get to The Valley of the Temples as care that parents have with one\u2019\
  s child who leaves home for the first time. \n\nThe archaeological site that keeps\
  \ the records of the Greek presence is rich in size and detail. The remnant of the\
  \ 5th century BC in an impressive state of conservation, shrines, monuments, temples,\
  \ which although weathered still tell stories of a time of fights and sacrifices.\
  \ It is a place that transports you temporarily, revitalizing the space-time fabric.\
  \ And I, a small point in this vast network, humbly trying to catch flashes of understanding,\
  \ looking for different angles of vision of the same thing to see a different, almost\
  \ hidden detail, that suddenly exposed to the field of vision. As if playing hide\
  \ and seek. And in this game, the sun was already set. \n\nThe Temple of Heracles\
  \ was the chosen place to rest my eyes and the limbs. Rather then the details, I\
  \ saw the whole, the sky at the horizon with almost earthy colour. The sun was hiding\
  \ behind the pillars of the temple. Contemplation and silence. Travelling alone\
  \ for Sicily was an unprecedented and daring plan that became rewarding in every\
  \ experience. Either with the contact with captivating people or for moments like\
  \ that, of total solitude. Coming back from my time travel. Contentment for what\
  \ I saw and for the immersion feeling. Inner deep contentment."
