Text: "It was my second day in Istanbul. The city that Napoleon once told could be\
  \ the capital of the earth. A city which immensely rich in history and I am here\
  \ now to make my own. Just like Fatih Sultan Mehmet that conquered the Byzantine\
  \ Emperor, I conquered my own fear and came here.\n\nI walked along on the road\
  \ that separates Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque. I am finally out from the stuffy\
  \ college dorm. Inhaling the clear autumn breeze. My eyes were gazing on my surrounding.\n\
  \nA simit seller who\u2019s really keen to sell those Turkish bagels by screaming.\
  \ \u201CSimit bir lira, simit bir lira!\u201D he shouted.\n\nI had no idea what\
  \ he was screaming. Now been living in the city for almost two years, I finally\
  \ understood that he was shouting \u201CSimit, one lira. Simit one lira.\u201D\n\
  \nIn the bench, there was a family of four. The youngest was still in a stroller,\
  \ while the older sister slept on her father\u2019s lap. The father was talking\
  \ to the mother. I couldn\u2019t eavesdrop what they were talking. But the mother\
  \ was smiling from ear to ear. I could feel their contentment. Heartwarming.\n\n\
  My mind goes back to four years ago where I visited the exact same area with my\
  \ family. It was just two days and I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about my home.\
  \ I was only this coward girl and maybe I still am, that always feel jittery every\
  \ time I lost my mom in the midst of supermarket aisle. I barely went out alone.\
  \ I always asked my mom to go with me to the hair salon. I never watch a movie alone,\
  \ shopping alone, let alone traveling and living abroad.\n\nNever thought that I\
  \ have this courage to fly away a thousand miles from home. Never thought that I\
  \ am brave enough to take the big leap and jump to a new adventure. But here I am,\
  \ alone, not knowing what will Istanbul bring me for the next three years.\n\nI\
  \ continued with my walk towards the Blue Mosque. The speaker from all six minarets\
  \ was echoing the prayer call, the azan. I took out my shawl from my backpack, covered\
  \ my hair, and entered the mosque.\n\nBlue Mosque is still the most glorious mosque\
  \ I have ever visited. The alluring blue tiles, the dazzling chandeliers, and the\
  \ exquisite domes, Blue Mosque is just impeccable.\n\nI dragged myself to the women\
  \ prayer section, took out my prayer dress and start doing my prayer. In my prayer,\
  \ I was grateful. I thanked God for bringing me here. I prayed to God to protect\
  \ my family and to always give them health and happiness.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize\
  \ tears were running down my eyes until it dropped on my laps. It wasn\u2019t a\
  \ sad tear, it was a happy one. It was gratitude.\n\nI took some time alone before\
  \ took off from the mosque. Once I again I admired the architecture, couldn\u2019\
  t believe that from now on I could be here any day I want.\n\nOff the mosque, I\
  \ went. I walked towards the exit door, putting on the boots that I just bought\
  \ the day before -because I, the tropical girl, never imagined that I could be living\
  \ in four seasons country- then I start wandered the most touristy area of Istanbul\
  \ again.\n\nIstanbul, let\u2019s start this journey."
