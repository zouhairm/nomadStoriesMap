Text: "As we approached our destiny, I caught myself distracted by the windmill in\
  \ a broad clearing in the forest. Its blade spinned softly, a contrast with the\
  \ noise from my city, where the motorcycles sound like they were going to blow away.\
  \ Unbelievably, we had left the institute just one hour ago and the houses were\
  \ already sparse. I was extremely comfortable in my seat, despite the fact the bus\u2019\
  s wheels were crashing into some rocks in the way.  \n\nThe respective trip was\
  \ part of the Sophomore\u2019s classes, more precisely Sociology\u2019s. My teacher\
  \ had discussed with us a lot about how that day was supposed to be, but I could\
  \ not picture the myriad of stuff I would witness. Firstly, I had no idea of Catu\u2019\
  s community existence before, even though it\u2019s one of the remaining indigenous\
  \ reserve in my state. Therefore, I feel it is my duty to share that place forgotten\
  \ by the world and don\u2019t let people make the same mistake as I did. \n\nAs\
  \ soon as we saw the entrance, the commotion took over my classmates. We stepped\
  \ out of the bus and walked on the clay and wet land. The cacophony of voices was\
  \ intense and was just over when the cacique came over to meet us.  \n\nHis appearance\
  \ could not be considered extraordinary, but his facial traits were the pure proof\
  \ of a heritage most of Brazilians carry on their past: a brown skin faintly burned\
  \ by the sun combined with eyes which reminded briefly the asian ones. He was a\
  \ middle-aged man dressing shirt, an old jean and wearing slipper. He introduced\
  \ himself as Luiz Catu, claiming he was going to show us around the community. \n\
  \nI can\u2019t deny I was expecting to find a \u201Ctypical\u201D indian with headdress\
  \ of feathers, full of body paintings and speaking an old language, but it turned\
  \ out to be just a misconception not only mine, but from most of my peers. As I\
  \ realized my mistake, a Ted Talks I had already watched came over my mind. It was\
  \ The Danger of a Single Story, by Chimamanda Adichie, and I went ashamed of myself.\
  \ I\u2019ve always hated stereotypes due to its inefficiency on telling the truth,\
  \ but Catu\u2019s reality was a bit of surprising for me as a Brazilian. \n\n He\
  \ seemed to know everything about that piece of land, which is an advantage of being\
  \ teacher of ethnic history and having lived there all his life. He showed a catholic\
  \ church, talking about the influence of Portuguese catechism in the past. One topic\
  \ he brought up was the family farming, main livelihood of the local population.\
  \ \n\nWe started to go deep into the woods and the vegetation ended up being exuberant.\
  \ The hodgepodge of colors shinned toward my eyes. We found out a passage of flowers.\
  \ It seemed like a rainbow of tones, and the landscape were completed by a lake\
  \ in the tip of the track. Some stretches of the trip were soaked by the mud, which\
  \ covered up my knees, and the air was wet and warm. We came across lots of cows\
  \ and even that was unnatural for me, who is used to spend all my day at school\
  \ or in the computer. \n\nAfter a long time, we finally arrived in the place where\
  \ the lunch was ready. There was full of distinct foods, such as fish and chicken.\
  \ When we finished eating, we went back to the bus to follow toward the indigenous\
  \ school, which was simple but also singular. A group of little girls were waiting,\
  \ willing to make body paints on us. We were driven to a tupi language class, a\
  \ tongue spoken by the indigenous. \n\nWhile we headed back, I got lost on my thoughts.\
  \ It occurred to me Brazil has no face. Our culture is made up by the diversity,\
  \ but sometimes we forget our background. Unfortunately, there are still people\
  \ who underestimate such identity. But there... The connection and the way they\
  \ handle with daily life problems were overwhelming. They are proud of their roots.\
  \ Therefore, I believe wherever I go that influence will stand by me, allowing me\
  \ to be more open-minded and kinder person."
