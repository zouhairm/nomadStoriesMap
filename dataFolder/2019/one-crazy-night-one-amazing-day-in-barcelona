Text: "Five Kazakh girls arrived in Barcelona late at night. The things started to\
  \ happen very fast. They bought tickets to the bus from an overcrowded airport to\
  \ a cheap hostel, where one night costed only 7 euros. Catalan air cosseted with\
  \ its warm wind. It must have been a breeze that was blowing from the sea. After\
  \ accidentally breaking a bus door and having listened some swear words from the\
  \ bus driver, the girls almost ran towards hostel direction. \n     The room was\
  \ almost empty, except for a girl who was already sleeping, when they entered the\
  \ room. The walls were decorated with modern graffiti, which were the first things\
  \ to be noticed. 5 bunk beds were spread besides the walls. It was much chillier\
  \ in the room than outside.  After a few minutes the girl woke up despite all those\
  \ attempts to keep the silence. It was obvious that she was French. Her specific\
  \ accent and face features told it instead of her. Her face, even without any make-up,\
  \ was full of charm, even if she looked very casual with fluffy uncombed blond hair.\
  \ After a short introduction, she immediately suggested to go to a club to dance\
  \ a little bit. The girls agreed since they didn't want to lose a minute while being\
  \ in this magic city, the city of their dreams. However, not all of them was so\
  \ enthusiastic about such an idea. Some of them wanted to have a proper rest before\
  \ highly anticipated day of long walks around the city. So, 3 of them decided to\
  \ stay and sleep. And the others followed the French girl. \n     When \"party animals\"\
  \ went out, the Barcelona air filled their souls and bodies with energy. They strolled\
  \ the streets with palm trees. It seemed that this city never slept: the noise of\
  \ bikes and Spanish language made the night city alive. In the morning the party\
  \ animals told the sleepy ones about how they had been changing one club to another,\
  \ about flirting with strangers and endless dancing to JLo and Enrique Iglesias\u2019\
  s songs. \n     All of them went for free walking tour. A tour guide from Florida,\
  \ who studied in Barcelona the history of arts, offered to spend a couple of hours\
  \ to see the most famous sightseeing spots. Of course, the key figure was Gaudi\
  \ and his unique creations. Casa Mila' astonished with its curves and shapes. It\
  \ resembled bone-like elements. Something cosmic and extraterrestrial gave an uncertain\
  \ impression. It looked magnificent and horrendous at the same time. Casa Battlo'\
  \ had a skeleton-shape design as well, but was also embroidered with colorful design.\
  \ Another significant element of this creation, a genuine piece of art, is the upper\
  \ element, which resembles dragon's backbone. Because of such bone-like details\
  \ and the roof, resembling dragon scales, there are plenty of legends related to\
  \ Casa Battlo'. These two architectural wonders and other houses, which are located\
  \ at the same avenue, are icons of Barcelona, the proof of Gaudi's boldness, that\
  \ is reflected through his play of light and colours. Most of these houses used\
  \ to belong to the richest and the most influential families of the city of that\
  \ time. \n     Despite the tiredness after a long walk tour, the girls decided to\
  \ stroll along the coast side to share the feelings and impressions and to enjoy\
  \ the sea water. Already familiar breeze was blowing with warm air, even though\
  \ it was a December evening. Barcelona seemed to be the most beautiful city to stay\
  \ forever or to come back again and again. The sounds of guitar and songs in Spanish,\
  \ the sea with turquoise water, hills, which were perfectly seen from the seaside,\
  \ vivid nature of Catalan people and so many other things. It was just impossible\
  \ not to fall in love with the city. The girls will never forget about that night\
  \ which let them fully relax and forget about everything, and that day, which filled\
  \ their heads with thoughts and hearts with pleasant sadness."
