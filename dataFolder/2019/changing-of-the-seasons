Text: "Montreal, when I arrived here you were all about sunny days. You were sturdy\
  \ trees and robust branches holding leaves in red and orange tones amid a sky that\
  \ was far beyond than just blue.\n\nWhen I arrived, Montreal, I was not as flowered\
  \ as you. My twigs were weak, frightened, ashamed and fearful. They did not carry\
  \ leaves as beautiful as yours. They were dry and empty. They would possible be\
  \ able to germinate pretty things, but the fear of failure stopped then at the simple\
  \ task of even trying to show what was growing on the inside. \n\nUntil your leaves\
  \ started falling through the sidewalks, while the mild weather was being replaced\
  \ by colder and colder temperatures. The sunny days gave up space to earlier sunset\
  \ as the homesickness decide to hurt the left side of my chest.\n \nWe were so different,\
  \ Montreal. You, noble and majestic with your French that I couldn\u2019t grasp\
  \ not a slightest bit and your calmness and quiet. As for me, I could not even describe\
  \ myself. I\u2019ve tried to understand you, but my cotton sweater was no longer\
  \ enough to cope with your low temperatures. When the snow came in, my shoes were\
  \ inefficient to keep me still and steady from your slippery sidewalks painted in\
  \ white tones. \n\nI had to dance your song and to adapt myself in the way you wanted\
  \ me to. You see, I had to grow up, to try and to take chance. I admit I was seeking\
  \ for you, but I was not expecting you to be this challenging, yet I appreciate\
  \ and the you for being. You were my leap into the unknow, but the fall was so worth\
  \ it.\n \nYou were what I needed and the reason why I'm coming home today with stronger,\
  \ more established and confident twigs, knowing that I need to let my leaves blossom\
  \ no matter what the shape, size or appearance of they might have.\n\nMontreal,\
  \ today I leave you after months and on my way to the airport, I see your streets,\
  \ your people, your sky and trees. And it's all different now: I already know how\
  \ to read your French signs in the streets (I mean, some of them), I\u2019m even\
  \ more admired by the particularity of your people, I understand that the sun is\
  \ going to leave the sky in an instant and I also pay attention to the twisted branches\
  \ of your \u2013 now \u2013 dry trees in the winter time. I\u2019m capable of appreciating\
  \ their beauty, as for you have taught me that everything is cyclical and that the\
  \ leaves will come back strong, beautiful and colorful for the next spring. I hope\
  \ I can see them one more time. See you later, Montreal."
