Text: 'Thailand is one of my favorite country in south east asia. the people, the
  weather, and the feel when you are in that country. How to real feel the bangkok
  ? Quite easy just learn a few word like "sawasdeekhap" and every body will answer
  it. Don''t forget to learn numbers cause that was very important to get a local
  price. When you are talking about thailand you need to talk about the food, one
  word i can say about thailand foods is "you will never forget the taste" event the
  mini market food all the thing which sale in there all of them is very delicious
  you will never forget haha my favourite is tom yum noodle they sell in the cup.


  The people is very kind, one day i left my camera when i was sitting in the street
  eat the food look around the road and feel the thailand, i forgot my camera and
  there are a security call me that your camera is left on th street, how ever i can''t
  understand what the said but when hia friend come to me and give my camera at this
  time i am very respected to all of the thailand citizen.'
