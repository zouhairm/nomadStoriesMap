  \ da-nun.\n\nThe Jaws theme tune blasts into the cabin of the speedboat. I\u2019\
  m sure they play this every crossing. The crewman had worn a maniacal smile as he\
  \ pressed the play button. So, the tinny sound of screaming teenagers and crunching\
  \ metal accompanies us as we race across the deep, dark waters in the fading light.\n\
  \nWe have just left the port town of Chetumal, Mexico. The fear still lingers in\
  \ my mind. A small group of travellers on a jetty waited to board a boat. We were\
  \ lined up in single file, backpacks laid out in front of each set of flip-flops.\
  \ Our guards wore dark-green head-to-toe, with a large badge across the heart declaring\
  \ BORDER CONTROL. They carried guns. Big guns. Not the type you pointed at someone\
  \ in warning, but the kind that are used to chop down crowds. Sniffer dogs strained\
  \ against choker collars, eager to reveal any amongst us who had dared to dabble\
  \ in contraband.  \n\nA curt nod from the commander and we were released from our\
  \ interrogation. Scrambling as one onto the boat that would take us across the border\
  \ to a new land of unknown. \n\nThe trip is long and tiring. Lurching back and forth\
  \ on a hard plastic chair. Outside the darkness has taken hold, and the ocean is\
  \ nothing but the splash of waves against the hull and glimpses of whitecaps, luminescent\
  \ in the moonlight of a clear night sky. Intermittently, showers of salty droplets\
  \ pelt against the windows as we hit larger swells.\n\nThe roar of the speedboat\
  \ quiets down to a whine, as we slow for our destination. In the distance, only\
  \ a couple of bright spotlights illuminate the wharf. Just an old-looking tin shed\
  \ stands at the end of the shoddy jetty, alongside which we have pulled up to no\
  \ reception. It all seems so casual, not the usual administrative formality of entering\
  \ into a new country. It makes me nervous. Where are they taking us? Where are the\
  \ lines of people and barbed wire fences? Where are the peddlers waving wads of\
  \ local currency in my face? \n\nWe all disembark onto the rickety pier. In an attempt\
  \ to be prepared, I fumble for my passport. Time distorts into slow motion as it\
  \ slips from my fingers, and falls towards the grey planks of wood under my feet,\
  \ and the large, dark gaps in between. Flipping end over end, it finally lands with\
  \ a thwak, safe from the black waters below. With shaking fingers, I retrieve my\
  \ identity from the boards. The group moves shufflingly towards the metal shack.\n\
  \nInside, a number of laminex tables are assembled. Behind each one sits a man or\
  \ woman in short-sleeved blue shirts. Our backpacks are proffered at the entrance,\
  \ and taken away through a door to our right. Anxiety gnaws at me. The fluorescent\
  \ lights buzz above my head and the warm sea air carries wafts of water-logged rubbish.\
  \ There is something off about this situation. My mind flickers briefly to horror\
  \ stories of missing travellers, sold off for body parts. I am waved towards the\
  \ next available table. \n\n\u2018Have ya eva been t\u2019 Belize before?\u2019\
  \ Asks a middle-aged woman with piercingly-serious, black eyes and hair slicked\
  \ back into a tight bun.\n\n\u2018No, no\u2026 my first time.\u2019 I attempt a\
  \ nervous smile.\n\n\u2018Well, welcome t\u2019 Belize!\u2019 Her face splits into\
  \ a glorious, beaming smile, as she thunks a stamp down onto my passport.\n\nA young,\
  \ skinny employee waits to help me into my backpack, as we exit the building. Outside,\
  \ as I slump into my relief, a large uniform-clad man rides slowly past on a pushbike.\
  \ Baton swinging in hand, he hums along happily to distant reggae music. It is here\
  \ that I feel my first love for the laid-back, go-slow attitude of the people of\
  \ Belize. As he passes he offers a broad smile and gives me a lazy wave. I catch\
  \ glimpse of the badge on the arm of his short-sleeved blue shirt. \n\nBORDER CONTROL,\
  \ it reads."
