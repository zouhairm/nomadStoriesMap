Text: "Speeding through an unpaved sandy road through the vast and empty desert in\
  \ La Guajira, Colombia, Miguel, our tour guide blasts reggaet\xF3n from the SUV\u2019\
  s radio. Instead of drowning out my thoughts, the Latin hip-hop music, enriches\
  \ my experience and meditative connection to the present moment as I sit and stare\
  \ outside at the passing -land and sky, land and sky-from within the car, pondering\
  \ the bareness. Suddenly, a break! Our tour guide pulls the car to a screeching\
  \ hault, and I\u2019m flung forward in my seat. \u201CDisculpa\u201D from Miguel,\
  \ \u201CEst\xE1 bien\u201D from me. Even though the journey seemed interrupted,\
  \ I was elated for the adventure and rewarded as I look up and see little wayyyu\
  \ children, from the nearby tribe, holding a rope as a make-shift toll booth in\
  \ front of us. In the middle of no where it seemed they had posted up this stop\
  \ on that bumpy unpaved road to ask tourists for money, water, and cookies. They\
  \ would not let us pass, until we rolled down the windows and handed them provisions.\
  \ Little hands browned by the sun and sprinkled in sand reach through the window.\
  \ A connection. Their world and my world. So seemingly different. I pass along some\
  \ cookies and struggle to say \u201CHow are you?\u201D in the local wayyuu language.\
  \ The children giggle at my pronunciation then keep running along to hold up their\
  \ rope and await the next tourists who we hear coming up quickly behind us. We start\
  \ to drive through as the children lift the rope, and In the distance, I see a young\
  \ boy, gray shirt, ripped jean pants, flip-flops. He is holding a bright green bird.\
  \ I am shocked because I realize in that moment that I have seen no trees, no green\
  \ during this entire journey.  This lime-colored bird was such a contrast in the\
  \ midst of dry dusty orange, muted red, and sandy yellows. Miguel pulls off to the\
  \ side of the non existent road, and we get out to take pictures of the dunes surrounding\
  \ us. I walk towards the boy as he is making his way towards us. No smile. Just\
  \ desperation in his eyes. I feel the extreme heat for the first time stepping out\
  \ into that shadeless land. No water to be found for miles. As the boy comes closer,\
  \ I notice the crust around his lips. We give the boy water and cookies, shamefully\
  \ wishing to give him more, but it is all that we have brought on the journey. In\
  \ a moment of silent reflection and deep empathy, I watch as the the boy thanks\
  \ us, not changing his expression, and then what he did next shook my world. He\
  \ took the water we gave him and carefully pried open the mouth of that vibrant\
  \ green bird and poured the water into its little beak. The boy gave freely and\
  \ generously to the bird and then washed its feathers with the rest. We said our\
  \ goodbyes, took our tourist pictures of the dunes, and hopped back into the car\
  \ with the blaring reverberation of Daddy Yankee. To sit, to ponder, to roll through,\
  \ land and sky, land and sky. Driving miles away, speeding through to reach the\
  \ most extreme northern point of South America, Punta Gallinas with the vastness\
  \ around me, and all I see in my mind\u2019s eye is the boy with the bird. Going\
  \ on this adventure to La Guajira, I never expected to find myself at a loss for\
  \ words from an act of safricifcal love in the most simple yet profound way."
