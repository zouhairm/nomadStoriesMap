Text: "\u201CCan I have your leftover food please\u201D the words spill from my mouth\
  \ ringing strange and foreign. I am hanging out in the only restaurant outside security\
  \ in the Panama City airport. Asking a group of strangers for their leftovers is\
  \ a plunge into the unknown for me.\nIntending to sleep in the airport I had arrived\
  \ in the evening to catch a morning flight to Cartagena. I was told I couldn\u2019\
  t go through security for hours. So, I sacked out on the floor next to an outlet\
  \ to charge my phone. My companion decided to get something to eat so he headed\
  \ down to the only restaurant. Minutes later I joined him. I discovered my companion\
  \ eating an unsubstantial cheese sandwich. I just about flipped when he told me\
  \ it cost eight bucks.\n            I had a big problem I wasn\u2019t allowing myself\
  \ that kind of spending, but I was famished. Then I noticed the neighboring table.\
  \ A typical family of five. The parents and three young adults. They weren\u2019\
  t finishing their food. There was an untouched piece of pizza and a large basket\
  \ of fries still on their table, and they were obviously done eating. An idea flashed\
  \ through my mind a strange, unknown idea, but I knew I would have to attempt it.\
  \ Just for the sake of trying it.\n             I grappled with concerns I thought\
  \ \u201Cwhat will people thinks of me\u201D. Trying to reassure myself I told myself\
  \ \u201CThe food will just be thrown away\u201D. I needed several minutes of whipping\
  \ myself into shape before I could actually do it. But I finally sidled up to the\
  \ table and begged for their leftovers. The father of family simply said \u201C\
  sure do you want a clean plate\u201D I replied in the negative. I scooped the piece\
  \ of pizza into the basket of fries and got out of there. The process was surprisingly\
  \ quick and easy.\n             As I sat munching pizza and fries, I reflected on\
  \ what I had done. Was I a beggar now? Why was asking for this food the hardest\
  \ thing I had ever done? After all, the food was going to get pitched. The family\
  \ that gave it to me acted happy to see me get it. The waiter was very genial about\
  \ the situation. I was getting fed for free, everybody was happy. Why did I feel\
  \ like the oddest person on the planet?\n             I contemplated growing up\
  \ in the rural midwestern USA. My family lived in comfortable poverty. Never able\
  \ to afford luxuries, with enough money to support small local charities, but never,\
  \ never asking or accepting aid of any kind. Was being a beggar for the first time\
  \ in my life showing me how much pride I took in myself? Had I looked down on all\
  \ the beggars I have seen? Had I felt in my heart a superiority? As I chewed the\
  \ last mouthfuls of the first food I had ever begged for, I still felt a certain\
  \ amount of shame. \n             I am glad I leapt into the unknown. That for a\
  \ few minutes I have felt like a beggar. That for one meal I swallowed twice as\
  \ much pride as food. But I am still not sure about the experience. When I tell\
  \ my friends the story it creeps them out. Has it done something to me? Have I found\
  \ a free way to eat while I travel? Maybe I will never know. Maybe I will never\
  \ repeat the social experiment. But who knows, restaurants around the world are\
  \ throwing away pounds of food. Why should it go to waste because of my pride?"
