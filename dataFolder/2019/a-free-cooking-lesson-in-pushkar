Text: "Go to Pushkar, they said. It\u2019s the best place, you\u2019ll love it, they\
  \ said. Within five minutes of arriving in the small town, I was starting to wonder\
  \ why they had all told me that. The main street running along the holy ghats, was\
  \ overflowing with tourist-oriented souvenir and clothing shops, backpacker cafes\
  \ selling special lassis and men saying, \u201CYes madam, looking is free,\u201D\
  \ as I passed their shop. I usually preferred to steer clear of places like that\
  \ and head to less visited areas where I could delve into the local culture without\
  \ having to convince anyone I didn\u2019t want to buy a wooden elephant statue and\
  \ elephant patterned pants to match. But perhaps I only needed to look a bit further\
  \ and the magic of Pushkar would reveal itself.\n\nOne early morning, I decided\
  \ to get up before the sunrise to head down to the ghats, the steps of the lake\
  \ where the Hindu pilgrims come from near and far to walk down into the holy water.\
  \ I sat on the steps for two hours, wrapped in my Rajasthani shawl to shield my\
  \ body from the cool air. I watched as men and women of all ages moved down to the\
  \ water\u2019s edge toting their plastic bags with a towel and fresh change of clothes\
  \ inside, ready to attain salvation by bathing in the holy water.\n\nOnce the fog\
  \ had lifted and the sun\u2019s warmth was luring the tourists out of bed, however,\
  \ I realised it was time to leave. I walked back up the stairs and found a small\
  \ sign that indicated a rooftop restaurant serving South Indian dishes, my favourite\
  \ Indian food. I went upstairs and was surprised to find nobody else there but the\
  \ friendly cook who was happy to make me idli sambar for 50 rupees and let me continue\
  \ people watching from the roof. \n\nI enjoyed it so much that I returned to the\
  \ same restaurant every morning for three days and each time I had the place and\
  \ the view all to myself, almost like a secret spot. The cook who also doubled as\
  \ the waiter, often came to chat with me whilst I drank my chai despite our limited\
  \ knowledge of each other\u2019s languages. \n\nOn my third morning there, he gave\
  \ me a complimentary second cup of chai and some fruit after my breakfast. He proceeded\
  \ to say, \u201CCome, I show you something\u201D. I was a little unsure of exactly\
  \ what he meant but eager to find out, I followed him. \n\nHe beckoned me into his\
  \ small kitchen and started to get the spice jars down from the shelf. I took a\
  \ glance around to find just a basic gas stove cooktop, a small fridge and pots\
  \ and pans scattered all over the benches, an organised chaos. \n\nHe opened the\
  \ first jar and got a sample out and gave it to me, \u201CCumin\u201D. He then continued\
  \ to do this for the spices he used to cook most of the dishes on the menu. He said,\
  \ \u201CThis is idli and dosa, you like,\u201D as he showed me the thick white batter\
  \ made from ground rice and lentils fermenting in a pot that would be cooked into\
  \ my favourite dish. \n\nHe used hand gestures to indicate what ingredients he pounded\
  \ in a mortar and what he chopped with a knife, as I watched on intently. He pointed\
  \ at more spices as he explained the two side sauces, coconut chutney and sambar,\
  \ that went with the dosa and idli. After the full tour of the kitchen and his menu,\
  \ he stood with his hands on his hips and said with a smile, \u201CNow you can make!\u201D\
  . \n\nI thanked him so much for showing me and I only then realised that hours had\
  \ gone by. My plans for the morning to hire a scooter had gone out the window, but\
  \ I didn\u2019t mind at all. I had just had a free cooking lesson of my favourite\
  \ food in India by a genuinely nice man who had become my friend. I walked down\
  \ the steps of his restaurant with a smile on my face and my heart full. I liked\
  \ Pushkar after all."
