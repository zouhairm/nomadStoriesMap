Text: "Living in New York City, meeting others from around the world was never a surprise.\
  \ You could be casually waiting in line at Starbucks and end up striking a conversation\
  \ with a former mayor of some small town in Bolivia. When my boyfriend and I decided\
  \ to visit Barcelona, Spain for two weeks, following my graduation, I thought I\
  \ would be surrounded by full bred Spaniards. However, I would quickly realize that\
  \ not only is Barcelona filled with many people of different background and ethnicities,\
  \ but also languages and food. One of our first few days in Barcelona, we found\
  \ ourselves lost in one of the cobblestone streets that surround the city, hopelessly\
  \ in search of a Gothic style church. We definietly did not have available wifi\
  \ and started to realize that we were going in circles. I happened to look left\
  \ and saw a man, quickly walking in our direction. I decided to approach him and\
  \ ask for help. Francisco was not only the perfect guide to our destination, but\
  \ also recommended a wonderful restaurant, one of which he worked in. He told us\
  \ he was on his way to work at the restaurant, which happened to be down the street\
  \ from the church. Along the way, he opened up to my boyfriend and I about how he\
  \ ended up staying in Barcelona after visiting the country 20 years ago on a vacation.\
  \ He was from Paraguay and decided that after visiting Barcelona, there was more\
  \ opportunity for him there. Along our 8 minute walk to the church, he told us of\
  \ how he missed his family, but chose to stay in Barcelona because he fell in love\
  \ with the culture and people. He recommended us about three different restaurants,\
  \ including the one he worked at and some off the path shops in El Born, the neighborhood\
  \ we were in. When we finally arrived at the church, we almost did not want to leave\
  \ him. Later on in the evening, my boyfriend and I found ourselves at the restaurant,\
  \ being served by none other than Francisco! Who would have thought that a random\
  \ man on the streets of Barcelona, from Paraguay, would turn out to be one of the\
  \ most helpful travel guides we encountered. The best part was that he was not even\
  \ a travel guide! He wanted to share with us how wonderful Barcelona was. \nOn one\
  \ of our other days in Barcelona, my boyfriend and I encountered a little old woman\
  \ with a teacup poodle. However, she was no grandma! This woman was dressed in an\
  \ all Gucci outfit and looked like she belonged in a fashion magazine. She was from\
  \ Atlanta, Georgia and had decided to travel around the world after retiring 5 years\
  \ prior. She had been living in Barcelona for the past few months, but still had\
  \ her southern accent. Lydia was her name and the poodle was named Winston. Not\
  \ only did she show us where the best wine was in Barcelona, but she went out of\
  \ her way to also ensure that we tried the best pan on tomate in Barcelona! \nI\
  \ went to Barcelona expecting not to be able to communicate with others or running\
  \ out of things to do, but found myself in the opposite situation. There was too\
  \ much to do and I could communicate with everyone! I was able to meet others from\
  \ South America (my native) as well as the United States. Spanish culture is more\
  \ than just Spanish. It is influenced by many other cultures, especially in Barcelona,\
  \ where there is a difference in Spanish and Catalan. I learned that New York is\
  \ definitely not the only melting pot of cultures."
