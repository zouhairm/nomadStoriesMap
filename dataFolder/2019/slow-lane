Text: "Durban is a vibrant gem on the east coast of South Africa; a city perpetually\
  \ changing. With a population diverse as the country itself, daily life is a colorful,\
  \ textured mess. Sprawling townships, lazy beachside suburbs and a cacophony of\
  \ languages and cultures mean that no day is the same as the next. It\u2019s South\
  \ Africa distilled into a nutshell of a place; difficult, beautiful, thrilling and\
  \ endlessly interesting.\n\nIt\u2019s also not where I spent my holiday.\n\n-\n\n\
  Drive an hour west of Durban and you will find the capital city of the province:\
  \ Pietermaritzburg. It\u2019s an unstable relic, and overwhelmingly poor. Apartheid\
  \ hovers in the corners of the town center; the wealthy white population long ago\
  \ fled to the leafier, more remote suburbs in the mountains. It\u2019s not a place\
  \ you\u2019ll find in the travel brochures. \n\nThirty minutes out of Pietermaritzburg,\
  \ into the rural area of Howick, stand five adjoining retirement complexes. In the\
  \ kind of poignantly absurd situation that only Africa offers, they\u2019re all\
  \ named Amber. Year-round security, electric fences and patrolling guards protect\
  \ a mostly white, aging population. Funeral notices are pinned to a noticeboard\
  \ by the information center. For the last few months, the council has been investigating\
  \ a newspaper thief. A woman next door to my grandparents has launched a legal battle\
  \ over her right to have a cat. \n\nTextured. Thrilling. Endlessly interesting.\
  \ This was my South Africa.\n\n-\n\nLast year, after an exhausting year working\
  \ in Barcelona, I crashed home into one of the Ambers. It was July and winter; the\
  \ hadidahs called in the morning and it was violently cold. Every evening we watched\
  \ TV and every day we would drive to the same coffee house, overlooking Umgheni\
  \ Falls. Zebra picked at the gardens. Impala- rodents of the savannah- chewed lazily\
  \ on grass. It rained incessantly. \n\nI am a frantic traveler. I pick a place and\
  \ go, usually alone, and arrive determined to launch myself into a foreign world.\
  \ The last year had seen me take the wrong train to Florence, run out of money in\
  \ Toulouse, contract bronchitis in Amsterdam and wander lost through Madrid. I had\
  \ lived fast and hard in Barcelona, fallen in love with people and places, and although\
  \ I didn\u2019t know it, I was burnt out.\n\nFor the first week I was chafing at\
  \ being on what they term \u2018Africa time\u2019. The slow drives through the Midlands\
  \ irritated me. I wanted adventure! I sat on the porch grumpily and watched the\
  \ cows graze at sunset. My grandmother sat beside and me and said \u2018you\u2019\
  re going to miss it.\u2019 I found it hard to believe.\n\nThe second week we hiked\
  \ the Drakensburg- a stunning mountain range in KwaZulu Natal. My feet bled. When\
  \ I looked down from the top of the trail, I felt I could see the entire earth.\
  \ South Africa is an intoxicating place. My father used to say that it gets under\
  \ your blood. Though its history is heartbreaking and its current state unsure,\
  \ there is an unbreakable spirit running through the country, strong as a spine.\
  \ You can hear it in traditional Zulu music. The drums sound like a heartbeat.\n\
  \nThe final week and we fled up to the border near Mozambique, to Ngwenya Park.\
  \ It\u2019s difficult to explain how empty a place can be, how devoid of people\
  \ and buildings. The horizon goes for a very long time. In the evenings we sat by\
  \ the river and peered through binoculars at the rhinos and elephants. Once, a pride\
  \ of lions came down to drink, and the cubs flung themselves into the mud, tumbling\
  \ and playing the way that all children- of all species- do.\n\nMost traveling offers\
  \ freneticism; a series of blurry experiences, one after the other, hysterical and\
  \ fun and thrilling. But there is a real value to sinking into a way of living,\
  \ another culture, and learning to slow down. By the time I was on the plane home,\
  \ I had reconnected with myself and my heritage. It wasn\u2019t a glamorous, Instagram-worthy\
  \ escapade, but my time in Amber offered me a peace that I never expected, and memories\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t trade for all the hostels and parties in the world."
