Text: "It was Gandhi Jayanti. That meant it was impossible to get alcohol anywhere,\
  \ the least of my troubles. I escaped to Goa to try and in some clich\xE9d way,\
  \ find myself. I got dumped recently, with good reason I should add.  On a spur-of-the-moment\
  \ decision, I decided what I really needed was to go looking for some faux-enlightenment,\
  \ thinking I was above all the other westerners with a saviour complex doing exactly\
  \ the same thing. \n\nI walked out from my accommodation, a leaking hut at the back\
  \ of a mosque where every morning I was awoken by the beautiful refrain of the adhan,\
  \ and took to the dusty road, keeping every cell of my being aware and my seven\
  \ chakras heightened so I could avoid the buses, auto rickshaws, cows, motorbikes\
  \ and dogs coming up from behind and startling me.\n\nI walked in order to familiarise\
  \ myself with the area. Everyone else seemed to get picked up to run the gauntlet\
  \ of high noon. It was so unusual for a westerner to be walking through the village\
  \ that rickshaws regularly slowed down and beeped to offer me a lift into town.\
  \ I would smile and wave them on before wiping the sweat from my brow and adjusting\
  \ the satchel on my damp shoulder.\n\nIt was over a mile into Palolem, so when I\
  \ found some shade on the beach and ordered myself a nice, cold mango lassi, I felt\
  \ like it was deserved. The bar manager, who assured me he was from Bristol, pinched\
  \ cigarettes from my pack as I read a book and smoked and drunk sweet yoghurt through\
  \ a straw. I watched families jump in the waves and holler to one another. It was\
  \ a national holiday and the beach showed it. There were crowds to rival the entrance\
  \ to the Taj Mahal. I was told repeatedly that I was in Goa too early, that the\
  \ Brits didn\u2019t descend until the end of the October when the rains had definitely\
  \ cleared. I liked the risk. Besides, the occasional flash flood had never done\
  \ me any harm.\n\nThe bar manager called me Mr Paul, asked if I wanted a beer. The\
  \ confused look I gave him in return suggested I was aware we weren\u2019t supposed\
  \ to drink alcohol on Gandhi\u2019s birthday. With a wink he told me he was sure\
  \ we could work something out. I sat and ate lunch in the bar, whole prawns as big\
  \ as a clenched fist, on a bed of rapidly dehydrating red and green salad. By the\
  \ time I\u2019m done it looked like a massacre; a pile of cracked, pink shells and\
  \ splayed legs.\n\nWhen the bill was put down on my table, there was something scrawled\
  \ at the bottom that I didn\u2019t recognise and couldn\u2019t read. The manager\
  \ told me it said \u201Cspecial\u201D and then delivered a package, wrapped in newspaper\
  \ to my table. I knew from the slight clink it made and the weight in my hands as\
  \ I tried to slide it discretely into my bag that I was handling contraband. I paid\
  \ for my lassi, my prawns and the secret parcel and headed back out into the sun.\
  \ It was too hot for me but there were still kids diving backwards into the surf,\
  \ their bare heads and shoulders periodically disappearing under a crash of white\
  \ static.\n\nI walked up the beach without putting my shoes back on, feeling hot\
  \ sand crunch between my cracked toes. I kept going until the crowds dispersed.\
  \ Then it was just me, the stray dogs and the jagged lines of the surf and the coast\
  \ on either side. I crossed a small river which still got high enough to soak the\
  \ turn ups of my faded shorts and then, checking around me, I stretched out under\
  \ a tree and unwrapped the paper package. There were two large bottles of Kingfisher\
  \ inside. I used the angles of a rock and the back of my hand to pop the lid off\
  \ one of them and then I watched the waves roll, drunk my beer and raised a wholly\
  \ inappropriate toast to Gandhi."
