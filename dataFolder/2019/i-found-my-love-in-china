Text: "My trip to Chongqing was to be a pure pleasure trip with no real purpose in\
  \ mind.  I stayed at my favorite hotel in the Nan\u2019an district.   I always try\
  \ to have a few bottles of wine in the refrigerator so the first of my stay I went\
  \ to a local shopping venue that I knew of from prior trips.  In reviewing the selection\
  \ a rather pleasant looking Chinese woman approached me and started to speak to\
  \ me.  I stopped her so that I could open my phone and activate my translation app.\
  \  She asked what kind of wine is good.  I knowing a little about wine asked if\
  \ she preferred white or red.  She replied \u201Cred\u201D.  I then asked \u201C\
  sweet or dry?\u201D.  She replied \u201Csweet\u201D.  I then showed her several\
  \ selections that she may possibly prefer but before I completed my statement I\
  \ suggested that she come up to my room in the nearby hotel and she could sample\
  \ some of what I was about to buy.  She being a very \u201Ctraditional\u201D Chinese\
  \ woman hesitated at first but then agreed.  As we walked through the lobby, all\
  \ eyes were upon us.  She appeared to be somewhat flustered but when we closed the\
  \ elevator doors it faded and we engaged in small talk for what seemed like an eternity.\
  \  Finally we reached my floor and entered my room.  I offered her a seat and proceeded\
  \ to open one of the bottles of wine (The purchase included two bottles of wine\
  \ and also two glasses).  We finished one of the bottles and then I asked her if\
  \ she would like to go out to the patio so that I could smoke a cigar.  She agreed\
  \ so out we went.  While I smoked my cigar we chatted through the translation app\
  \ and formed a real connection which soon led to hugging and kissing.  She being\
  \ an extremely traditional woman expressed her frustration so having finished my\
  \ cigar I asked if she would be more comfortable in my room.  To my absolute pleasure\
  \ I smiled and took her hand and proceeded to my room.  When we entered the room\
  \ she immediately hugged me and kissed me repeatedly.  One thing led to another\
  \ and we were soon in bed enjoying the absolutely most fantastic lovemaking that\
  \ I have ever experienced.  I learned then that Chinese women know things to satisfy\
  \ a man while they are also being fulfilled.  \nWe spent the remainder of my ten\
  \ day stay in Chongqing together for every minute of every day until, sadly I had\
  \ to leave.  She cried as I got into the taxi and then - It was over.  But, not\
  \ so fast.  I am currently in India and on my way back to China and my Chinese love,\
  \ Shu."
