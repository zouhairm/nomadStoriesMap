Text: "So we did a 3 day walk true the mountain of Peru to reach the mystery city\
  \ of Machu Picchu.we add our tour guide Jos\xE9,our cook Josie,our medical assistant\
  \ (wich I don\u2019t remember is name)and is white horse,plus two other horse to\
  \ transport all our camping gear and heavy luggage. While we were walking true this\
  \ uneven terrain,we went true all kind of weather,from warm to rain and snow.The\
  \ higher the more dificulte it was to breath 100m from reaching the top,I just call\
  \ our medical assistant and mount the horse,why not i add to try it.But what took\
  \ my breath away was the moment I got out of my tent,to meet the others for dinner\
  \ on the next tent and look up and saw the Milky Way.With so much darkness around\
  \ us the stars were as close to the touch that a couldn\u2019t  see anything else.I\
  \ will never forget that moment.After our walk we camp in a very small town were\
  \ we stay for the rest of the day.Us being Portugues add no problem speaking with\
  \ the local,so conversation went to soccer.On that day it was the champions league\
  \ final Shelsea/Bayem Munichen and the boys want to see it,so they were invited\
  \ to watch it on one of the local home.Seating on the foot of the bed with beer\
  \ in hand and chicken walking all over,with this tiny TV they add the day of there\
  \ life.This is our story"
