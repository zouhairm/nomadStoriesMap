Text: "I want travel a lot but I firstly prefer mystery places than relax around the\
  \ beach. Most people like discover Mountains or different countries in the start\
  \ of their tripping. But I always do something at the contrary. I love my country\
  \ - Russia, and I found it interesting to see special places or unnamed places better,\
  \ than gorgeous and famous sightseengs. All amazing views, for example, I saw near\
  \ to my town Togliatti. And I want to tell you about place, which  hypnotized me\
  \ a lot. The blue lake - it is an official name of mere. Nature Monument The Blue\
  \ Lake is located in the Sergievsky district of the Samara region of Russia, a natural\
  \ monument of regional importance. \nWater of this lake just super cold! There is\
  \ only no way to swim, because water has a constant temperature all year round,\
  \ about 8 degrees, and doesn't freeze even in winter. Another feature of the lake\
  \ is the almost complete absence of life in it, which is why local people sometimes\
  \ call it a \u201Cdead lake\u201D, but at the same time they believe that if you\
  \ swim in the healing waters, you can be cured of all diseases.The depth of this\
  \ lake is not determined with accuracy, since according to geologists, the lake\
  \ has a volcanic origin and its bottom is difficult to measure. I can say that the\
  \ water there is really icy, but having been to this place once, you will definitely\
  \ come back again. In addition, there is a sulfur lake nearby which is also known\
  \ for its mysterious appearance history. Intrigued? Go to pack your bags!"
