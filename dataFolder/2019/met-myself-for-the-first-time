Text: "Dream! That's how I will describe it. But no, it was that period of time when\
  \ I had hit rock bottom in my life, the most dearest soul to me made a journey to\
  \ a better place other than Earth. So, humans kept calling me for giving their heartfelt\
  \ condolences but one of those calls was from my aunt who lived in Pune. She just\
  \ said one thing, come down to Pune I'll take you to a place where you may find\
  \ someone. \n\n\nIt did sound good and I was waiting for a change, so, me and my\
  \ folks left for Pune, leaving the scorching heat of Nagpur behind. My aunt had\
  \ planned a trip to her ancestoral home in Sasawane, expecting me to renovate their\
  \ oxygen. I never understood why she would call her home oxygen, she would always\
  \ say, watch it for yourself.  I as an architect imagined it to be a home which\
  \ had climatology out of the box. So, I was eagerly waiting for this oxygen, I really\
  \ wanted to feel it. \n\n\nAfter a long four hours drive with taking detours to\
  \ eateries, this Sasawane village came. I was already ready with the phone camera\
  \ taking the time lapse from village to oxygen. For three minutes I took the lapse\
  \ and my uncle made a turn and there it was the oxygen. While I was taking the lapse,\
  \ I just turned around and saw this humongous Arabian Sea facing the oxygen. And\
  \ just then it got cleared, why she calls it the oxygen. \n\nAn old house, facing\
  \ Arabian Sea, with no barriers, in midst of a village you don't even know exist,\
  \ calm people, local food and appealing architecture with the most beautiful landscape\
  \ around. I had these goosebumps which even when today I remember, I get tears in\
  \ my eyes. \n\nWe settled down and went near the beach and just had some good time,\
  \ later we went around to see a port and some temples around the village. In the\
  \ evening, I was looking at the beach and thinking how lucky I'm to visit this place\
  \ and experience the beautiful piece of nature. My aunt came and said, we sleep\
  \ here with doors of the house open at night, the sound of the waves was her favourite\
  \ lullaby. \n\nAll this sounded so crazy and I was waiting to experience it, so\
  \ around nine o'clock we went to bed, I made my bed in the front room just in front\
  \ of the main door. I got on my bed upside down and started gazing at the surreal\
  \ sky and endless sea and I don't remember when I slept away. It really was the\
  \ most beautiful lullaby I had ever heard in my life. \n\nNext morning I woke up\
  \ at five, everyone was sleeping, even the other villagers too, I left my phone,\
  \ slippers behind on bed and made the walk to the beach. It was the walk of silence,\
  \ like I was the last person on Earth, the closer I was getting to the beach, the\
  \ more I was gaining confidence to face this glittery sea which was looking at me.\
  \ \n\nI was standing in front of this sea staring, staring how beautiful it was\
  \ and how beautifully alone it was. After the gazing for couple of minutes I had\
  \ tears in my eyes as I just wanted to dive in and tell the sea, I'm there for her.\
  \ Standing there, something hit me, we all are loners in life somewhere, souls come\
  \ and go with time, it's us who have to let them go and breathe. We cannot hold\
  \ to situations forever, the sea taught me this great deal and that day I finally\
  \ could say goodbye to Buzo. \n\nI freed him from my thoughts and the very next\
  \ moment I did this and turned around, I saw two dogs playing with the sunrise from\
  \ East. It was like the world was welcoming me again. That moment I thought, I met\
  \ myself and how intelligently nature gives you signs to survive.\n\nI got so many\
  \ answers that day just looking at the sea, maybe I can say, I met a soul named,\
  \ Aditi."
