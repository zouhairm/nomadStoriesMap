Text: "I am woken up by my mother in the dead of night, it is winter and we are on\
  \ the roads of Keshkal Panchvati. She whispers in my ear \u201Clook, look! Wake\
  \ up! It is a lion!\u201D she says. I am drowsy from all the throwing up because\
  \ I get bus-sick. I noticed that we had come to a halt and opened my eyes to see,\
  \ it is pitch-dark on either side of this 109 year old poorly lit road and there\
  \ is a lion\u2019s silhouette on the road. The silence and wonder hugs us all as\
  \ the lion rises like a king, slowly, and swoops away in the bushes. We are 133\
  \ kms away from Jagdalpur, where we would be staying for the next two days. \nI\
  \ am traveling with 70 other people who are government employees, including my mother.\
  \ The polytechnic department has arranged our stay in the empty quarters. \nAs the\
  \ morning approaches, we are ready to head towards a 14th century Sati temple. The\
  \ sanctum sanctorum of Danteshwari maa, which is also a family goddess of a lot\
  \ of families in Bastar, is said to be amongst around 50 other shrines of the female\
  \ principal of Hinduism. As I enter the temple I could feel the divinity in the\
  \ air; the red and golden flags flowing on the towers, the aroma of incense sticks\
  \ spreading all around, the bells ringing and the echoes of devotees chanting mantras.\
  \ I walk in the shrine and immediately a priestess asks me to change the clothes,\
  \ as I am wearing jeans. They offer some clothes there but I would recommend you\
  \ to wear traditional clothing or take a change of clothes with you as it is considered\
  \ disrespecting the goddess, to walk in wearing jeans. After having prayed and wished\
  \ for power and peace, we are now walking towards the garden area, which is just\
  \ behind the temple, in the search of a place to freshen up a little. A local family\
  \ who lives there takes care of the garden.  To my surprise, I find a young deer\
  \ sitting on a man\u2019s lap. I could not help but go and pick it up myself. Its\
  \ name was baby. The pet owner told me, \u201CHe and his mother live with us. We\
  \ provide them shelter and some food to eat. Right now she has gone into the jungle\
  \ for the afternoon walk\u201D, he said. I wondered how good it would be if this\
  \ harmony could be spread in the world. \nThe next stop was at a local\u2019s home\
  \ for some delicious food which was made in pure ghee and as chhattisgarhiyas like\
  \ it, spicy. Although I had expected the ant chutney, the speciality of Bastar,\
  \ but I guess I would have to make another trip for that.\nWe retire to the beds\
  \ in our quarters for the next day hustle. \nAs the December morning approaches,\
  \ we could see the occupied quarters decorated with the Christmas lights. Under\
  \ the beaming sun and cold winds, we take off to the 'kanger valley national park'.\
  \ \nThe road to the kutumsar caves feels like a roller coaster ride, only with actual\
  \ perils from wild and humans around us. It is believed that behind those lucious\
  \ green trees that seem to be stopping every ray of sun to touch the ground, hides\
  \ the naxals and wild bears & lions. It was in the jherum ghati that the entire\
  \ Congress of the state was killed.\nAs we start walking down towards the entrance\
  \ of the cave, I notice the abundance of green around me. These caves are closed\
  \ due to floods during monsoon i.e. June to October. The caves gets darker every\
  \ step of the way almost like life, and we finally make it to the end. Alive and\
  \ well. Tirathgadh, on the opposite of it, is a waterfall that I climbed. \nThe\
  \ last stop is Chitrakoot- the small Niagara falls, the widest waterfall of India.\
  \ The sun is setting and a full moon rises from the indravati water. The boats are\
  \ being brought to shore and massive lights are put on for the onlookers to enjoy\
  \ the pearl white fall. We sit and there's bliss."
