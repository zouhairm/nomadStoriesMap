Text: "It was a cold morning in Port Harcourt, a city in the Southern reaches of the\
  \ Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by \u201Cblack gold\u201D, that formed the treasure\
  \ base of the nation. The previous night had really been too cold for comfort, as\
  \ I kept brooding over the invitation by a friend whom I had met in Abuja, the capital\
  \ city of Nigeria. He insisted I attended his traditional marriage rites in his\
  \ ancestral village, about 18 hours by road from Port Harcourt---Technology having\
  \ made communication easy, we have kept in touch phone calls, and he had returned\
  \ to Jesho, to farm Irish Potatoes, a cash crop of the Ron Chela people.\nOn the\
  \ 26th of February, 2018, I left for Jesho in Plateau State, North Central Nigeria.\
  \ The journey from Port Harcourt to Jesho was not soothing, it was a paean of pain,\
  \ a psalm of sadness, a proverb of pathos, a hymn of heartbreak, a symphony of sorrows\
  \ and a story of sifting. We traversed dense vegetation of the mangrove and rain\
  \ forest, rugged mountain ranges, hills, valleys and precipice, before ascending\
  \ the Jos Plateau, one of  the highest peaks  in Nigeria. We alighted in Daffo,\
  \ 50 kilometres from Jos, and my friend was there to pick me up with his motor bike.\
  \ To my utmost amazement, Daffo was the last trace of civilization; we continued\
  \ the journey through undulating hills in the cold and dark night. I was drained\
  \ when we arrived, and was welcomed by members of his immediate and extended family\
  \ with a meal of corn pudding and soup, unique to the Ron Chela people. There was\
  \ so much expression of love and joy that I fell asleep amidst the crescendo of\
  \ traditional music.\nJesho is a remote mountain community that separated the inhabitants\
  \ from the world, and the farming separated them from relationships that were much\
  \ needed, that should have been a source of joy and support. They live with the\
  \ Fulani people, a nomadic tribe in West Africa. The Jesho community granted the\
  \ Fulani people abode in the early 17th century. The Fulanis are predominantly cattle\
  \ breeders. People is a lens through which life is perceived; these disparate cultures\
  \ through their differences generate a different experience of reality.\nHowever,\
  \ the traditional marriage rites were so colourful, with so much to eat and drink,\
  \ traditional dances, masquerade displays and wrestling, I was happy I took that\
  \ bold step. Travelling is a human requisite and the rewards compensate for the\
  \ emotional and physical depletion, but I wandered too far, and I discovered that\
  \ no one was immune to death. The day following the traditional marriage rites,\
  \ an indigenous Ron Chela youth was caught up in a show of rivalry with a Fulani\
  \ youth in the village well, a fight broke out and he \nclubbed the Fulani youth\
  \ to death. The community was thrown into disarray as the tribal elders tried to\
  \ settle the issue. After some hours there was calm, and the community seemed to\
  \ be peaceful once more.\nThe village was awoken that night with the cry of babies,\
  \ children and families as the Fulanis launched a reprisal attack; an ethnic cleansing\
  \ targeted at the Ron Chela people. Huts were set ablaze, and as many that could\
  \ escape headed for the mountains. The night became an advantage as we were no longer\
  \ visible in that hideous night of violence. Looking back Jesho was a sparkling\
  \ red crystal, the smoke rising up like a rejected sacrifice.\nNevertheless, near\
  \ dawn, a woman who had made it with us travailed, and was delivered of a bouncing\
  \ baby boy. Some hours later, we were spotted by a patrol helicopter and were rescued.\n\
  The physical and psychological footprint of the ethnic cleansing was widespread,\
  \ but the people of Jesho have used the trauma as a tool for transformation. They\
  \ are not back to their ancestral land, but are actively engaged in their new found\
  \ homes within the State.\nIn rounding off, as humans, we are survivors, and solidarity\
  \ is needed to create a sense of social connectedness, which is vital for successful\
  \ management of life struggles, especially for those living in cosmopolitan setting\
  \ in distant lands."
