Text: "When you travel to Jordan, your told to go to the Dead Sea, Wadi Rum, Wadi\
  \ Mujib, and the most infamous of all the ancient city of Petra.\nPetra literally\
  \ takes you into an ancient world that doesnt fit in with the digital age. In one\
  \ day my fit bit tracked 25,000 steps, which included an estimated 850 plus to the\
  \ Monastery. Along the path an old Arab woman hummed and made coffee on a small\
  \ fire and had dates next to her trinkets for sale to offer her customers. My husband\
  \ and I smiled as we proceeded past, but glad there wasn't pressure to buy but that\
  \ didn't last long.\nAs you wind up the stairs the vendors become more aggressive\
  \ and overwhelming. We were nearly reached our destination when a grill named Sarah\
  \ grabbed my hand. She said \"come, let me show you the best view in all of petra\"\
  . She couldn't have been any older than 10. She pulled us to he family's stall which\
  \ sat on the edge of a cliff. Her father came to us smiling holding a tray with\
  \ coffee, and glasses. With true Arab hospitality  he offered us some coffee, and\
  \ we gladly  accepted. \nSarah asked us where we were from, and after hearing we\
  \ were American she expressed her love for the Green Bay Packers. She had so much\
  \ personality, and she knew how to hustle. Shortly after chatting she was all about\
  \ persuading my husband to buy things for me. Her mother attempted to convince me\
  \ to buy several trinkets from their stall. We eventually convinced them on the\
  \ way down we would stop only at their stall.\n\n\nWe made it to the top of the\
  \ monetary and took the opportunity  to rest and take in the architecture that was\
  \ truly amazing. After a hour of sitting at the shop on the top with the dogs we\
  \ decided to make out decent. \n\nAs we came down every vendor did not ask,but rather\
  \ argued with us stating that we promised to buy a scarf from them. We told them\
  \ \"no\" we do not make promises we can't keep. One after the other it was feat\
  \ trying to make it towards Sarah's family stall.\n\nEventually we made it to her\
  \ stall and bought a few pashminas, and a travel plate with a Jordan design. The\
  \ presence this girl had was admirable, because we wished our own children could\
  \ carry themselves with her level of confidence. We wished we could do more for\
  \ her. \n\nWe paid for our items and continued past the donkeys towards the bottom.\
  \ We passed the old Arab woman, but she was now sound asleep. I was truly amazed\
  \ she wasn't concerned with her merchandise and she was so comfortable so sleep\
  \ in the pathway. It was truly a different world."
