Text: "Dear Portugal, \n\n\n\n17 years had lapsed since I had seen you. \n\nI knew\
  \ you are a fantastic country, I know your people are warm and welcoming, that your\
  \ pastries are mouth watering and that your architecture is breathtaking. \n\nNothing\
  \ however prepared me for the experience I had in 2018. \n\nLanding in your beloved\
  \ Cidade Invicta, Porto, on an early Lufthansa flight and I already couldnt take\
  \ my eyes off of the view from the window. \n\nYou're vibrant and beautiful, even\
  \ from thousands of feet in the air. \n\nFeeling the airbus tyres touch your soil,\
  \ I knew I was home, and I was overcome with emotion. \n\nMy favorite part of you\
  \ is the Ribeira and Cais de Gaia. Bursting with culture, happiness and awe. \n\n\
  As I stood on the Dom Luis I bridge, and looked at Gaia to my left and Porto to\
  \ my right, the sunset in front of me, I was overwhelmed by your beauty. \n\nYou\
  \ painted the sky with the most extravagant colours. Royal blue, orange, gold. \n\
  \nYou, Portugal, were showing off.\n\nI couldn't help but pause and just admire\
  \ you. \n\nNight fell, but you radiated life and joy, despite the frigid temperatures.\
  \ \n\nYour diversity makes anyone feel welcome. \n\nYour advanced infrastructure\
  \ and systems, mixed with your old world, historical architecture adds to your charm.\
  \ \n\n\n\nLooking at you, you remind me of the old known poem, \n\nSomething old,\n\
  \nSomething new,\n\nSomething borrowed,\n\nSomething blue. \n\n\n\nI cant help but\
  \ believe that you are one of the most remarkable places on earth. \n\nMaybe I am\
  \ biased. After all, your blood flows through my veins.\n\nI left you with a heavy\
  \ heart, and I long for you still. \n\nNo matter, I will see you again. \n\n\n\n\
  Love, \n\nYour greatest admirer"
