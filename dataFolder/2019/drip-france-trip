Text: "Travelling is the most exciting thing in the world. First of all, it lets us\
  \ discover the world and to see different countries, experience their cultures and\
  \ traditions. Moreover, we enrich our knowledge about life in general and particularly\
  \ about ourselves. Travelling also gives us an opportunity to meet new interesting\
  \ people, learn new languages and develop our skills. That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying\
  \ to travel as much as possible.\nThe best trip I\u2019ve ever had in my life was\
  \ to France. Although it happened two years ago, but I still recall this wonderful\
  \ time with a great pleasure. I went there with two of my friends and it was really\
  \ the right decision, because we travelled by coach and the journey took a long\
  \ time. We were playing cards on the way, singing songs and joking all the time.\
  \ As we arrived we checked in a hotel not far from the center. We were exhausted\
  \ but in a good mood.\nThe first day in Paris was fantastic. It was a bus tour around\
  \ the city called Open Tour. We got on a bus at the nearest stop. It was amazing\
  \ that it stopped in front of all sights, so we could get off and walk around the\
  \ most famous places. We took thousands of photos of Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Arch\
  \ of Triumph and other monuments. We were impressed by the number of tourists and\
  \ the beauty of the places we visited. We spent 4 other days in Paris, but this\
  \ first time our impressions were thrilling.\nThe next days we visited plenty of\
  \ museums and had some time for small shopping to buy souvenirs. Last evening we\
  \ went on a small excursion by boat. It was amazing to be on board and to see all\
  \ the sights again as if they were saying goodbye to us.\nThus, it was fantastic\
  \ time and I hope to come back to Paris one day to get the same marvelous emotions\
  \ there."
