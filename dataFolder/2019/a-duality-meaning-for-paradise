Text: "When the oppression \u201Ccalmed down\u201D somehow, I decided to make a trip\
  \ to the lagoon, it has been a long time since I didn't enjoy the beauty of its\
  \ water and landscapes. After going down the highway spiral to reach the lagoon,\
  \ there was an unusual silence along it, which I understood when I finally arrived\
  \ at my destination. It was like a ghost town, no tourists, just some locals from\
  \ the surrounding villages. The resorts? empty, closed or even on sale. I guess\
  \ just locals have the privilege to live so close to a paradise and enjoy it as\
  \ much as they can.\n\nBut, is this place a paradise? the houses of the town reflect\
  \ a society that holds to selfish values, poverty, hunger, injustice, and corruption.\
  \ In contrast, the people, are the reflection of what a humble heart looks like.\n\
  \nNonetheless, the lagoon was just like I remembered, crystal water, surrounded\
  \ with high trees with monkeys climbing on, intrepid squirrels that go all the way\
  \ up to the top of the trees, and that peaceful song of the wind that encapsulate\
  \ the entire landscape on a musical note. Being here is my biggest freedom, my utopia.\n\
  \nAfter spending some time swimming on it, like any mortal, it was my time of the\
  \ day to eat something, so I decided to walk around and seek for any open resort\
  \ or local restaurant that would serve my need, but what I found was a small house\
  \ with a sign that stated \u201CBreakfast and Lunch\u201D, just 4 tables, no menu\
  \ and the typical plate with rice and beans that a lady will cook just for me, the\
  \ unique customer.\n\nIn a corner, there is a man working with his hands, sweaty,\
  \ focused, fast, immersed, and I could swear he can even make it with his eyes closed,\
  \ he is making those typical baskets that are used mainly for the Purisima celebration.\
  \ As my curiosity expands, I start a conversation with the man, which is the owner\
  \ of the small \u201Crestaurant\u201D, strong, brown skin, short height, dirty clothes,\
  \ tired eyes, and his hands are full of injuries, not for what he is currently doing,\
  \ but for all the hard work he has done his entire life.\n\nWith a kind smile, he\
  \ welcomed me and shared his story with me, he was born in the business, just as\
  \ his parents did, he had to learn the technique of the handmade baskets in order\
  \ to survive and move forward with his family, but still that wasn't enough to have\
  \ a decent life, the baskets business is more like a seasonal business, people mainly\
  \ ordered them for the December celebration, then the rest of the year he got a\
  \ few or nothing. \u201CWhen I was a kid, I had to beg 1 cordoba to 1 cordoba around\
  \ the town for almost 3 months in order to save enough money and buy a pair of shoes\
  \ for me, that was a privilege that my parents could not afford\u201D, he said.\
  \ (Cordoba refers to the national currency)\n\nI was speechless, what could I answer\
  \ to this?, It has never been difficult for me to get a pair of shoes, but arrive\
  \ at this place. However, my reply was not necessary, \u201CEnjoy your meal\u201D\
  , he said, as I realized my food was finally served, \u201CThanks\u201D, I answered\
  \ back and that was the end of our conversation. After that, I paid for my food,\
  \ which was even more expensive than the price of a heritage tradition, the man\
  \ sells each basket for $1.56. I left the house and enjoyed the rest of the day\
  \ in my temporary paradise, before going back to my little world.\n\nIn the middle\
  \ of the long volcanic chain which runs through the country of Nicaragua, there\
  \ is a wide and extended crater in a form of an inverted cone, and in the center\
  \ of it, there is one of its most beautiful lagoons, the Apoyo Lagoon. Which is\
  \ one of the most touristic places in the country, or was. Due to the political\
  \ crisis and protest since April 2018, the number of tourists has decreased exponentially,\
  \ but the lagoon still preserves its beauty and the locals, their stories."
