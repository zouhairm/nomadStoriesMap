Text: "I spent the summer of 2012 riding ferries over turquoise waters and busses\
  \ over rolling hills. I hiked to ancient temples on seaside cliffs and rode donkeys\
  \ down to hot springs. Most importantly, I tasted beautiful notes of spinach and\
  \ feta pies paired with perfectly aged wine\u2014I tasted the Mediterranean and\
  \ fell in love. \n\nI spent 2012 studying culinary journalism in Greece and through\
  \ this experience I realized that cuisine truly reflects the rich tradition and\
  \ history of the lands and its people. \n\nThis was increasingly apparent when I\
  \ arrived on the peaceful Greek Island of Kea, where I visited Agalia Kremezi\u2019\
  s culinary school. Kremezi, a former journalist turned cookbook author, offers cooking\
  \ classes at her vine and flower-covered home.\n\nShe taught me how to make all\
  \ of Greek staples: stuffed grape leaves, herb flatbread, and paper-thin phyllo\
  \ dough. \n\nMostly though, she impressed upon me this mantra of sorts: no meal\
  \ is complete without a brimming glass of wine. \n\nThe ingredients that Kremezi\
  \ taught with came straight from her own garden, allowing me to taste the flavors\
  \ of the land. Ultimately, it was the people around me that made this class such\
  \ a genuine experience. \n\nHer husband, Kostas told stories of how they met and\
  \ fell in love. Kremezi told her secrets on how she managed to perfect cheese pies.\
  \ Her table was always one full of dedication, laughter, and joy. \n\nI found this\
  \ to be true throughout my journeys through Greece, no matter what island I visited.\
  \ \n\nThere was no fast food to be found on the tiny island of Kea and very few\
  \ were found on any other island. The only fast food to discover outside of Athens\
  \ were places that sold gyros. \n\nIn Greece, eating out involves rich conversation\
  \ and savoring every bite. Meals could last well into midnight with wine still being\
  \ poured and conversations never dying out. \n\nIt felt like as soon as I feel into\
  \ this delightful habit of slower meals and aromatic eats, it was already time to\
  \ go home. And the first thing that greeted me? A McDonalds in the airport. \n\n\
  After spending time in a country that prided itself on local flavors and culture,\
  \ I was back in a country whose priorities did not match. \n\nImagine what our world\
  \ could look like if we bothered to spend more than five minutes eating in front\
  \ of a television. What would dinner look like if we put down our phones and actually\
  \ talked to our loved ones for hours on end? \n\nI have seen what it looks like\
  \ and what it does to the people who live there. A simple thing such as enjoying\
  \ food and conversation can truly change a whole culture\u2019s perspective and\
  \ the way that they treat one another.\n\nI think we  have to take one out of Kremezi\u2019\
  s book of wisdom: it\u2019s time to fill up that glass of wine and start talking\
  \ to each other again."
