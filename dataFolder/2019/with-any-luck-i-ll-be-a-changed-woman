Text: "I have often dream about traveling to destinations unfamiliar then my own,\
  \ as a black woman growing up with not much to my name that dream tended to take\
  \ a back set to the struggle of every day life. Just making it out from under the\
  \ bills, making it out of poverty making it out of worry was the dream then, travel\
  \ didn't belong to me. that changed with time and faith and I started to realize\
  \ that this might be within my reach, but I am ready? I would be getting on a plan\
  \ for 14 hours, stepping foot onto soil unlike that of which I had always crushed\
  \ beneath my feet, surrounded by people me in almost every way and to add frosting\
  \ to the bitter sweet cake of fear I would be doing it all ALONE! The morning of\
  \ my flight my senses were alive even though it was 5:00 am and I have yet to drink\
  \ a warm nerve calming  cup of my favorite coffee I was surprised my eyelids were\
  \ keeping themselves open this early, but there I was throwing clothe in my suit\
  \ case last minute as usual. I zipped to the plan, feel into my window  seat and\
  \ prepared myself for the longest flight of my life. I tried to sleep through most\
  \ of my uncomfortable plan ride but my thoughts keep me plenty busy with the what\
  \ ifs, and how's, and who's of my journey. what will my hotel be like, who will\
  \ I meet, how will I respond to the language  the people the food? my excitement\
  \ bursting to the surface just below my skin, but with came its cousin fear, will\
  \ I be safe at my hotel, who will I meet and how will I respond to the dangers of\
  \ the city, the people, the streets? \n Finally my layover in China! wow the hustle\
  \ and bustle of the strange city was like that of a well timed clock, everyone running\
  \ hear and there moving in and out of the tapestry of the city, me fumbling and\
  \ tripping about, it was clear that I did not understand the inner workings of this\
  \ beautiful rhythmic dance they swayed to, nor did I have the time to study its\
  \ movements for I was off to catch my plan and to face the rest of my journey. finally\
  \ after frustrating thoughts, clumsy dancing and rushed fears I made it to Bangkok\
  \ the capital of Thailand. if I had to share the best moment of the city its walking\
  \ through the markets, the streets smelling of the delicious aroma from the food\
  \ carts, noises of laughter and of surprise from the beauty of the temples all covered\
  \ in gold whispering to your higher self to come in find peace and meet enlightenment.\
  \ The voices of the young children singing by nearly empty pans the coins left behind\
  \ representing the please traveler that stopped before you. I noticed the huge amount\
  \ of massage spaces, tattoo parlors, and the odd tourist trips here and there with\
  \ pushy yet pleasant greeters demanding you come in and be apart of their story\
  \ if only for the moment. \nI meditated with the monks, sang with the chore of nameless\
  \ children, eat until I couldn't feel my toes and danced with my new found friends,\
  \ this trip will one day be a distant memory something I will briefly recall as\
  \ a foot note in a distant conversation, but now in this moment as the dust of travel\
  \ fall from by brow and the fog of the journey still circles my head it is the best\
  \ thing that could ever happen to a poor black girl from the streets of Atlanta,\
  \ it has changed my perspective on what is possible and it is a reminder that dreams\
  \ do come true."
