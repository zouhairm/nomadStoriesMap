Text: "It was nine hours until my despidida (the Portuguese word for a farewell party),\
  \ and I was on the complete other side of the island on the back of a dirt bike\
  \ laughing uncontrollably with a dead chicken in my left hand and a one-liter sized\
  \ plastic bottle of palm wine in my right.  \nThis is a four by eight snapshot of\
  \ the Timorese word \u201CRunga-Ranga,\u201D translated as chaos or in less profound\
  \ circumstances, a mess. Throughout my time in the country I have heard this word\
  \ spoken with tears, with impish smiles, from children\u2019s mouths and red betel\
  \ nut stained grandmothers\u2019 lips. \nI first came to Timor-Leste in February\
  \ 2016; whereby previously Timor only carried a visage of post-conflict, and of\
  \ being simultaneously the newest and poorest nation in Southeast Asia. After being\
  \ in the country and becoming personal with its diverse cultures, Timor-Leste\u2019\
  s meaning now lies in the land and the populations beloved relationship to it. It\u2019\
  s about how the connection to land and ancestry hasn\u2019t been severed, even after\
  \ the \u201Cchaos\u201D and wreckage of Indonesia\u2019s severe occupation from\
  \ 1974-1999. \nThough a small country of about 1.2 million, it certainly carries\
  \ its\u2019 own accolades. It has been recognized as an ecological smorgasbord for\
  \ earth and biological scientists, a poster child to UN peacekeeping interventions\
  \ after the 1999 referendum leading to the country\u2019s independence, a distinct\
  \ dive location nestled in the coral triangle, and the list goes on. \nSo, back\
  \ to the chicken. It lived a happy life at the base of Mount Laleno in the eastern\
  \ Fataluku speaking region of Timor-Leste where I was invited to stay by Sisto dos\
  \ Santos, a friend and fellow human rights activist. The given name to this region\
  \ is Rua Rua but has been bequeathed the name \u2018Sakulolo\u2019 which translates\
  \ to snail, inspired by the snail shaped rock cave which was a shelter used by Sisto\u2019\
  s ancestors. Sisto and his family who had invited me here, are on a long mission,\
  \ maybe you could even say following a calling, to develop the area with a methodology\
  \ which is symbiotic between the environment and the surrounding communities\u2014\
  embracing an ethos of creating a world where many worlds fit, inviting international\
  \ collaboration without being vulnerable to it.\n\u201CThis is a slow revolution,\u201D\
  \ Sisto had expressed repeatedly, \u201Cthis is what happens in the silence when\
  \ no one is watching.\u201D\n\u201CAfter the war ended, the first thing I did was\
  \ come to this place to listen,\u201D said Sisto; he pointed to a specific rock\
  \ between two trees as we drank the palm wine crafted by his cousin and he began\
  \ to share the story  of how he first came to know his ancestral homeland, as he\
  \ was forbidden from the region until after the 1999 referendum.  This was the entire\
  \ reason why he had brought me, as he told it; I was to share this story with others,\
  \ and I could not share this story without experiencing and knowing the land myself.\
  \  As the chicken was being defeathered by his nephew Augustino, I gazed out to\
  \ the coconut palm forest I contributed planting to the day prior\u2014it was there\
  \ his father's great-great grandparents had lived and had been buried, and the heart\
  \ of a land which, beyond all odds, has remained.\nEntering that area felt like\
  \ crossing a threshold of hundreds of years; decades of guerilla style warfare,\
  \ decades of disappearances and dislocation, decades of colonization under the Portuguese\
  \ rule, and decades of nomadic existence when their ancestors lived freely as clans.\
  \ \nWhen I went back a year later Augustino and the family came to greet me like\
  \ a returning relative; \u201Cdo you want to see the tree you planted?\u201D he\
  \ asked me. As we smiled down on the still humbly sized coconut palm I thanked him\
  \ for taking care of it, for being my teacher, and for remembering my name. \u201C\
  Welcome home Lexie Sakulolo,\u201D he said, and I laughed in realization because\
  \ Sakulolo had in fact been writing me with everyone else who belonged to this place,\
  \ those who were willing to listen and not afraid to laugh in the face of chaos."
