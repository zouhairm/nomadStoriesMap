Text: "I'm in Nagaland chasing crimson, the colour that connects all the inspiring\
  \ images that have drawn me there \u2013 the resplendent Naga shawls that each of\
  \ the 16 Naga tribes weave; the fiery skin of the King Chilli, one of the hottest\
  \ chillies in the world; the blood of the Naga insurgency that has claimed thousands\
  \ of lives; and the delicate blooms of the rhododendron tree endemic to the Naga\
  \ hills in the north eastern corner of India.\_\_\n\nMy first stop on this crimson\
  \ journey is Kohima, the capital city of Nagaland. Pabino, a 50 year-old Naga man,\
  \ with deep laugh lines running down the sides of his mouth, is ferrying me up the\
  \ gravelly, potholed road from the only airport in Dimapur. Outside the window of\
  \ Pabino's rickety old car is a jumble of brown and grey. A cloud of sand, gravel\
  \ and ochre dust follows us. Great yellow bulldozers on either side claw out the\
  \ mountain sides. \"The hills here are very soft. The soil comes off easily\", says\
  \ Pabino hunching over the steering wheel. Even in the chill air, he is sweating\
  \ under his woollen golf cap, trying to keep his wobbling car from falling apart.\_\
  \n\nA little ahead, a soldier in military fatigues, AK 47 rifle slung over his shoulder,\
  \ flags us down. I feel a pluck of anxiety in my stomach. \"Permit?\" he asks. I\
  \ hand over a greenish slip of paper that authorises my entry into Nagaland. Even\
  \ after 15 years of the peace accord between the Nagas and the Indian government,\
  \ soldiers continue to patrol the length of the state. Pabino seems unruffled by\
  \ them. For more than six decades, the Naga tribes have demanded independence from\
  \ the Indian union. Men of Pabino's generation have been shot down in forests, in\
  \ towns, in their own homes. For now, the state has won. The Nagas have borne their\
  \ crimson wounds with pride, and erected monolith after monolith commemorating Naga\
  \ leaders who have given their lives. As the soldier returns my permit, and waves\
  \ us through the checkpost, I heave a small sigh of relief.\_\n\nAt the mouth of\
  \ Kohima town proper, another uniformed official signals the car to stop. It's a\
  \ young traffic policewoman, barely 25. A flash of crimson on her lips. As she lets\
  \ a line of schoolchildren cross the road, J.K.Rowling, Eminem, Che Guevara, Oprah\
  \ Winfrey, Albert Einstein, Abraham Lincoln stare at me from a mural wall on the\
  \ opposite side of the road. There's a little quote : this is the Wall of Hope,\
  \ celebrating people who fought against great odds to become who they are. I make\
  \ a mental note to look up art galleries in Kohima. Perhaps there's a crimson connection\
  \ there too. \n\nMy thoughts are interrupted by Pabino. \"Have you come to the Hornbill\
  \ Festival?\" he asks, pointing to a billboard with photos of Naga men and women,\
  \ dressed in their traditional feathers, beads, shawls. Inset photos of bamboo handicrafts,\
  \ handloom silks, fried silk worms, boiled snails, red hot chillies \u2013\u2013\
  \ all promise an authentic Naga experience. Right behind the festival billboard,\
  \ small shops sell brooms, and ropes, detergent and plastic. Oranges and bananas.\
  \ Nothing crimson.\_\n\nAs Pabino drops me off at the guest house I'm staying, I\
  \ ask him \"Do you know where I can eat a good Naga meal?\" He pauses to think \"\
  I eat my meals at home. I don't know much about these restaurants.\" He smiles a\
  \ smile that reaches the corner of his eyes. I'm a little perplexed by this man.\
  \ Perhaps I shouldn't have come here without first going through a crash course\
  \ at Hornbill Festival? Crimson is for festivals, I'm foolish to chase it in a city\
  \ that has gone back to work.\n\nThe next morning, there is a surprise waiting for\
  \ me at the reception: a small, round plastic tiffin box stuffed with rice and shredded\
  \ pork, tossed in king chilli. There's no note. I sit down to eat. My tongue swells\
  \ with a fiery heat of crimson joy I have never felt before. The hottest chilli\
  \ makes my eyes water and I begin to wonder, what is the colour of kindness?"
