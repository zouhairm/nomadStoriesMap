Text: "Daniel Bates, who lives in England, was about to marry, he invited us Jhosue\
  \ and I to the event. The plan was to step in Europe a few weeks earlier so we could\
  \ travel some countries before. Therefore, it wasn't in our plans to step in Africa,\
  \ we decided it while having an ice cream in Toledo, Spain. \nAnd there we were,\
  \ heading our way to Sahara desert, from Marrakech, one of the more iconic cities\
  \ in the world. With people who do not accept a \"no\" as and answer, who can easily\
  \ speak other languages perfectly and with a totally different culture comparing\
  \ to Mexico city.  \n\n\u2014Have you felt it, Jhosue?\n\u2014What? \u2014he asked\
  \ immediately, with a mouthful of cous cous .\n\u2014That sensation of being infinite...\
  \ \u2014I replied.\n\u2014Never, have you? \n\nI was still waiting for it to happen.\
  \ We were somewhere in the road close to Ouarzarzate, known as the entry door to\
  \ Sahara desert. We had make a quick stop to have lunch. My best friend and I were\
  \ wearing moroccan outfits, Jhosue had actually a turban on his head and people\
  \ confused him with a moroccan citizen. Of course, he was playing his roll very\
  \ well.\n\n\u2014It's time to go! \u2014announced the driver to the air. \n\nAll\
  \ the group of tourists entered the bus one by one. And after a minute, we were\
  \ on the road again. We visited our last stop before the desert: Kasbah of Tifoultoute\
  \ (hard to pronounce it, right?). Located eight km west to Ouarzarzate, there is\
  \ this fortress that belonged to the family Thami El Glaoui for around 40 years.\
  \ It is a good place to take pictures and discover the culture of Morocco that lays\
  \ in its walls. Made of this kind of clay that truly creates a fresh atmosphere\
  \ inside the rooms, so you can rest from the heavy sun in your skin. They call it\
  \ moroccan air conditioned, and after centuries, they keep using this tricks, as\
  \ it is cheap and easy to maintain. They also filmed the movie Alxander the great\
  \ in this place, with Angelina Jolie.\n\nFor those who don't know what a Kasbah\
  \ is. They are fortified spaces of berber origin (an ancient nomad tribe that nowadays\
  \ live in their villages by the sahara desert and other distant places as mountains),\
  \ used to protect people from sand storms and even war.\n\nFinally we got to the\
  \ desert where we rode camels to get deeper in the place. The sun was starting to\
  \ hide in the horizon and the wind became fresh. After we got to the spot, they\
  \ gave us some moroccan tea, made of green tea and peppermint. My favorite, they\
  \ call it moroccan whisky, as they drink it instead of alcohol. \n\nThey had a show\
  \ prepared for us, with drums and arabic songs. We where inside a really big tent,\
  \ covering ourselves of the sand that blew up with the wind. Jhosue looked at me,\
  \ he was very happy. I was smiling while my body was moving to the rhythm of the\
  \ drums. People from Germany, England, India and Mexico, were living together that\
  \ night. Enjoying that time as never before. \n\n\u2014Hey Vilchas \u2014spoke Jhosue\u2014\
  \ let's go for a cigarette. I drank my whole tea in a gulp and followed him outside\
  \ the tent. Where the sand started to hit our bodies. \n\u2014I can't see anything!\
  \ \u2014I admitted, the wind was taking my words, I couldn't feel more alive.\n\u2014\
  Me neither! \u2014spoke Jhosue. We laughed an then my friend stopped suddenly. He\
  \ was looking the sky\u2014 Vilchas... \u2014he pointed straight\u2014 look at the\
  \ stars. I did as he said.\n\u2014Oh sh... \u2014I was completely amazed. Those\
  \ were the best stars I have ever seen in my life. My heart stopped and my stomach\
  \ felt empty. I started to feel as a tiny point in the universe \u2014Jhosue...\n\
  \u2014Yes?\n\u2014I... feel\n\u2014Infinite \u2014he finished."
