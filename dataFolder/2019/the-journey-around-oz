Text: "Mmm adventure- I could smell it in the air. It lingered in the frosty swirls\
  \ of mist and reflected in the jagged walls of ice. I will take you through a journey\
  \ where you are going to play the lead character. Every journey has a starting point\
  \ and destination. After this adventure you will not only learn a lesson but experience\
  \ the world differently. Before we travel, we need to ask ourselves a question we\
  \ will hopefully have an answer to at the end of our journey. When are you your\
  \ purest self? \nThis time, I will take you the land down under- Australia! Where\
  \ the nature is the rarest on the planet. Take a deep breath, open your imagination\
  \ and let me guide you through Australia\u2019s beauty.\n\nYou open your eyes and\
  \ see 74 islands and more than 50 anchorages, stretched in long, pre-white beaches\
  \ underneath your floating self. Slowly gravitating back to the ground you decide\
  \ to land on the Whitehaven beach. Standing on the edge of the sand right before\
  \ your feet hit the water, you stare into the ocean, taking in the most beautiful\
  \ beach you have ever seen. Lost in your thoughts you drift back to memories with\
  \ your loved ones. You feel the soothing breeze dancing through your hair, whispering\
  \ the song of the ocean.  At the same time the ocean breeze whispers like a lover,\
  \ placing salty kisses on your cheek, but on days like this never forget that it\
  \ is just a mere hint of your imaginary dreams, tossing your thought and emotions\
  \ to the shore. \n\nIn the great barrier reef, you cross path with Humphead Maori\
  \ Wrasse, giant clamps and hundreds of species of the sea critters. However, you\
  \ dive only on the surface of the ocean, then just like us human, the life hosted\
  \ in the oceans living on the reef need the light from the sun.\nThe fluidity of\
  \ life far below the waves brings a sense of freedom and levity; in the aquatic\
  \ world your pain fades into the sea and becomes dim and distant. Getting so far\
  \ away form the world you know increases your connection you want to escape. Without\
  \ the distractions, the constant noises, the pollution, your mind is free to simply\
  \ dwell in the people and places you love. Down here under the sea you are free\
  \ to turn and move as you which, the tied of gravity fades to nothing. You hear\
  \ the voice of caution whispers \n\nAs you breath in the fresh air into your lungs,\
  \ making your way to land, you notice the colour of the water you are in. You left\
  \ the ocean and you are now gazing with amazement at a pink lake. Looking through\
  \ the waters of the lake is like peering though perfect glass, unsmudged by the\
  \ sticky prints of small children. A deep sense of serenity overcome your thoughts\
  \ as you started in rapture at the expanse of pink that lay before you. What turns\
  \ an ordinary body of water neon-pink? Pink Lake, or Lake Hillier, it\u2019s a saline\
  \ lake on the edge of middle Island, largest of the island and islets that make\
  \ up the Recherch\xE9 Archipelago in the Goldfields-Esperance region, off the south\
  \ coast of Western Australia. \n\nInside the Daintree rainforest there is a sense\
  \ of serenity, no technology, no gimmicks, just nature in its rarest state. The\
  \ forest so old and powerful from the outside, but yet so delicate like a new-born\
  \ baby. Her leaves dance to unheard beat, whispering their songs to the wind.  You\
  \ are submerged in a million subtle of greens, with sickly sweet, intoxicating aroma\
  \ and music of resident animals, you are unable to savour even a second.\nYou can\
  \ taste the perfume of blooms in the air, holding your hands up to feel the cascading\
  \ light, a brilliant white shaft illuminating the path that takes you onwards and\
  \ home. In that moment you are your purest self, no strings, no worries, no negativity\
  \ storming within you. Just you and your mind in peace, forever grateful for the\
  \ growth you\u2019ve experienced through this journey."
