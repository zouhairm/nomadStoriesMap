Text: "Aspects of Islamic law and religion have been introduced to me in different\
  \ ways while exploring various countries around the world. Two of these experiences\
  \ in Thailand and Egypt are discussed below. \n\nOn one of the final days of a group\
  \ backpacking tour of Thailand, our group was scheduled to camp on the beach on\
  \ Khao Phing Kan (otherwise known as James Bond Island) in Phang Nga Bay.  In 40\
  \ degree heat, on a very humid day, I was dressed in my bikinis ready for my first\
  \ beach camping experience. \n\nDuring the boat trip to our camp, the rain started\
  \ pouring down. Our tour leader, Khemkhaeng, advised that the beach camp was no\
  \ longer possible and that we would be staying in alternate accommodation. Completely\
  \ mesmerized beach-fronted jungles on the islands, I was surprised when in the middle\
  \ of the ocean we stopped at a Muslim fishing village. \n\nThe village was established\
  \ 100 years ago and was built solely on stilts over the ocean. My friends and I\
  \ received weary looks from the villagers as we climbed out of the boat wearing\
  \ only our swimwear.\n\nOn the walk through the village, we passed broken bridges\
  \ and homes which were yet to be rebuilt from the damage caused by the tsunami in\
  \ 2004. I was allocated the farthest hut out of the village. The floor of my hut\
  \ was comprised of rotting wooden planks and I could see the ocean between the large\
  \ gaps in between planks. \n\nEarly in the morning, I awoke to my hut swaying in\
  \ the wind. The water from the ocean splashed up into my hut from in between the\
  \ planks. I was convinced that my hut and I would soon be swept away into the sea\
  \ and was becoming increasingly scared. It was then that I heard a chant, a song,\
  \ a voice - the call to prayer. The prayer was beautiful and provided a sense of\
  \ comfort and peace throughout the storm. I fell asleep.\n\nA few hours later, I\
  \ was talking to a local man from the local coffee stand. He told me that the only\
  \ reason why the fishing village remained during the tsunami yet the coast and other\
  \ islands around them had been completely destroyed was because the villagers always\
  \ prayed five times a day as required by the Quaran. The prayers provided a sense\
  \ of comfort to the village people during the tsunami just as they provided me with\
  \ comfort the previous night.\n\nIn 2012, I travelled to Egypt to fulfil an ancient\
  \ history dream of visiting the pyramids, mummies and seeing Tutankhamen\u2019s\
  \ treasures. As part of my trip I also visited the famous mosque of Mohammed Ali.\
  \ \n\nMy guide, Mammdouh, explained the religious history of Egypt as I began to\
  \ cover my skin and hair so that I could enter the mosque. Inside the mosque, Mammdouh\
  \ explained that the Quaran says that men can have four wives and \u2018whatever\
  \ they can\u2019. He explained that a sultan once had 27 wives and that while he\
  \ could have four wives he was entitled to \u2018whatever he can\u2019 and so could\
  \ have numerous slave wives.  Mammdouh told me that the Muslim Brotherhood's aspiration\
  \ to bring the legal age for marriage in Egypt from 18 years down to 12 in order\
  \ to more closely align the lives of modern day Egyptians with the life of the prophets\
  \ (one had a nine year old wife). \n\nI was horrified by the thought of the proposed\
  \ changes to the law which would allow female children to be forced to marry adult\
  \ men by \u2018bringing the life back to the time of the prophets\u2019. I began\
  \ to see how the religious movement of the Muslim Brotherhood could have a significant\
  \ impact on the laws and human rights of Egyptians. \n\nIt was then I thought back\
  \ to my drive into Cairo during which my driver, Kafele, told me that he had brown\
  \ paint on his right finger to indicate that he had voted. Mamdouh told me that\
  \ if the Muslim Brotherhood were elected \u2018I leave Egypt\u2019. A few weeks\
  \ later, I heard that the Brotherhood had won the election."
