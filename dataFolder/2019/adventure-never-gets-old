Text: "I discover my perfect way of travel in Osaka, the starting point of a quick\
  \ and unplanned japanese trip on the way back from Australia.\nAfter a long delayed\
  \ flight and a couple of trains, I finally met mr. Hitoshi, waiting for me at the\
  \ small station near home. He is a 71 years old japanese man, the perfect example\
  \ of all the kindness the land of the rising sun's people are well known for. As\
  \ he lately explained me in his basic self-taught words, he sarted to study english\
  \ and host travelles when he got retired, five years ago. That night he just showed\
  \ me his small typical japanese house, my futon and where I would have to be in\
  \ the morning at 8 o'clock for the breakfast. \nWilling to observe the typical japanese\
  \ punctuality I woke up a little bit earlier, finding him in the kitchen cooking\
  \ okonomiyakies and making a smootie with his garden's fresh kakies; he also introduced\
  \ me his 93 years old mother, we had breakfast together and we made our way to the\
  \ main train station, starting point of the bike tour of the city. Just few days\
  \ before I was surprised to read on a post to watch out for the crazy bike riders\
  \ on the footpaths in Japan, and I now found pretty fun figure out I was one of\
  \ them, trying to follow him between people and obstacles! \nIn just one day we\
  \ went almost everywere, from the most touristy places to local markets and temples.\
  \ He taught me how to do the shinto's praying ritual: after the self purification\
  \ in the temizuya fountain, put a little charge in the offering box, ring the bell,\
  \ bow and clap the hands twice and, after a while, bow again. Or don't clap the\
  \ hands and burn an incense stick if the ritual is happening in a Buddhist temple.\
  \ \nWe only stopped for a shushi roll in front of the Osaka castle and for a coffe\
  \ from one of the numerous konbini, the convenience stores located everywhere in\
  \ Japan. He told me what to do and also what not do to don't waste time (and money)\
  \ on \u201Ctourist stuff\u201D, we took some dinner and we went to pick up new upcoming\
  \ travellers from the train sation. Only later we figured out we now were too many\
  \ people for his small car, but we finally decided to try to fit all of us together:\
  \ we probably looked like sardines in a box, but we somehow enjoyed it.\nThe morning\
  \ after I decided to go to help him with the breakfast, ending up cutting cabbage\
  \ and onions for like half an hour! He seemed glad to don't have to do it, and that\
  \ made me happy as well. After the okonomiyakies we left all toghether for anoter\
  \ beautiful cycling day, this time in Kyoto. \nNothing really special happened,\
  \ but that little man definitely made my days, and my whole trip. I figured out\
  \ the kind of traveller I want to be, and how much just a normal day with a normal\
  \ person in his humble place can be a far away better experience than visit all\
  \ the top rated tourist attractions sleeping in the fanciest hotel. We live in a\
  \ world where almost no one does anything for nothing, and find someone willing\
  \ to host random people and share his breakfast, spend two full days showing them\
  \ around and telling them about his culture and traditions with no demands can't\
  \ do nothing less than make me willing to be always a better person.\nTravel is\
  \ amazing, but at some point take places off from the bucket list is not enough\
  \ anymore; sometimes I wonder if it does really worth to go all the way up to the\
  \ opposite side of the world just to take that cool picture. That's when this kind\
  \ of experience reminds me to always look for new adventures, because it's not just\
  \ about the places but mostly about the people."
