  \ your laptop and office. It's okay being a busy person with a million dreams, but\
  \ you should know your body limit to make more improvement in live.\n\nAs a woman\
  \ in the middle ages, I never forget to remind myself that this life not only about\
  \ making money, but also about my own happiness. I enjoy spending time with family\
  \ and do solo traveling when I have time.\n\nI want to introduce you one beautiful\
  \ place, I calles paradise in Indonesia. It's Nusa Penida, in Bali Province. \n\n\
  When you come and visit this island, you can meet a beautiful place and also peoples\
  \ who inborn in that place, they are kind and warm.\n\nI love spend my whole day,\
