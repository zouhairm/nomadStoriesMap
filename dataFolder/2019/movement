Text: "Full February in the provinces of Angola, an overwhelming heat covers the plains\
  \ that highlighted the most colorful sky my eyes had ever admired. After a day of\
  \ adrenaline, miles of dubious roads and holes with bits of tar lost in the middle,\
  \ we were able to reach the route that led us back to the nearest town, at least\
  \ with accommodation and gas pumps. We had been up since 4 o'clock in the morning\
  \ and the day had not been smooth, so we only wanted to fall round in bed.\n   \
  \ The day was falling and I asked my father if he wanted me to take the car to the\
  \ lodge, it took about 6/7 hours to drive so I offered. We stopped the car and changed\
  \ places. This would be the first time driving on African land, for those who think\
  \ it's easy, it's not. Personally, I like to think it's like African GTA. You never\
  \ know what can happen, who can come and in what way. Also, it's very rare to find\
  \ a reasonable length of kilometers without considerably large holes. One more dose\
  \ of adrenaline and a lot of caution. To improve this, clouds came to greet us and\
  \ brought lightning whose light created a stupendous scenery on the savannah that\
  \ surrounded us. It was indeed worthy of picture.\n    My attention redoubled and\
  \ I enjoyed above all that unique environment. It was about 10 kilometers when it\
  \ began to rain torrents, night shut and no light except a few cars. Malanje was\
  \ close and I just wanted to get there. In Angolan lands it is very common for children\
  \ and animals to walk freely on the street, mixed and everywhere. My only fear,\
  \ besides being stuck in a hole in my father's jeep, was running over a child or\
  \ an animal. The problems that we would have later would not be worthy of picture,\
  \ for sure. So I promised myself we'd be fine.\n    The rain didn't stop, the windows\
  \ didn't clear and the windshields were too slow for what I needed. The traffic\
  \ began to increase and in these samples of roads can get up to 5 tracks, I looked\
  \ to my left and watched brown water to half of the tires. My father kept warning\
  \ me that the car was diesel and that I could not get water in the engine, needless\
  \ to say that was the least of my worries. My whole body contracted with concentration.\n\
  \    The location of the hotel was hard to find and the mood between me and my dad\
  \ was only stress. We approached a young man on the street who actually was in a\
  \ hurry, I don\u2019t know how he agreed to help us find the hotel but my father\
  \ invited him into the car and we started again. At this moment I don't know if\
  \ I expected good or bad. I took a deep breath and trusted. He was telling us the\
  \ way and after a few laps we happily found it, as a thank you my father took him\
  \ back to his destination while I was checking in at the only hotel in the area.\n\
  \    My father arrives for dinner when he tells me the episode of that boy's day.\
  \ By the time we approached him, he had found his sister at home after being beaten\
  \ by her boyfriend. He was in hurry under that terrible rain to be able to complain\
  \ to the police this event, something that unfortunately in Angola will not be worth\
  \ anything. I felt tremendous compassion at that moment, my father helped him monetarily\
  \ and wished him peace in the family.\n    We must recognize that life is much broader\
  \ than we often realize. Often we limit ourselves unduly and ignore the extent of\
  \ our real possibilities. I was grateful to be safe and sound with my father, and\
  \ to know that my whole family was well."
