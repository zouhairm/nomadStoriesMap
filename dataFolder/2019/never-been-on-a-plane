Text: "It was just a couple of weeks into the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. My sister had\
  \ moved to the Uk June 2009 and I was missing her. Celebrated my 21st without her\
  \ and thought this is enough moping, I went searching for any deals on flights.\
  \ And I found one. I had this credit card since I started college(emergency funds),\
  \ I charged $897 on to it. Which got me 7 weeks to spend with my middle sister,\
  \ re-celebrate my 21st. \n\nNow see that\u2019s not the amazing part of my story...\n\
  The amazing part is I had never been on a plane before I took this trip. A trip\
  \ that changed my look on everything. \n\nSeven weeks...I didn\u2019t just stay\
  \ in the small apartment in Redhill,Surrey UK. No no we went to Cardiff, Paris,\
  \ Dublin. Which were all breathtaking in their own ways. \n\nEverywhere I went I\
  \ left a little part of me but I can guarantee that England and Dublin has pieces\
  \ of my heart that I left willingly. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Paris was beautiful,\
  \ but beautifully rude in their own way. Not very welcoming to open its arms to\
  \ embrace a young traveler seeing a new part of the world for the first time. And\
  \ Cardiff well I didn\u2019t stay to long there to fully get a chance to start a\
  \ relationship with it. \n\nI came back from that trip understanding that there\
  \ is more to life, my life than being a sick person who was ready to close herself/myself\
  \ off from a world that\u2019s only trying to teach us about ourselves. We just\
  \ have to listen. \n\nNow I can say that I have been on a plane a fourth time now.\
  \ All the way through Vancouver B.C., Seattle Wa., Dubai UAE, Punjab India all for\
  \ my older sister\u2019s wedding."
