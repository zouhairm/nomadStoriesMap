Text: "He likes to call me his little white one. \"Mi blanquita,\" he says while stroking\
  \ me over the cheek. My tall, dark-skinned friend who makes distinctions but never\
  \ judges. To him, calling a person black or white is no different than calling a\
  \ car red or blue. Just like we need to examine the inside of the car to evaluate\
  \ its quality, we must get to know a person before we can make any assumptions about\
  \ their character.\n \nEcuador and its inhabitants form such a colorful kaleidoscope\
  \ of contrasts. When it rains here in this enchanted land on the Equator, it pours.\
  \ The streets flood, the umbrellas break, and people hide inside their houses for\
  \ days to escape the cold. On the contrary, when the sun comes out, it gets so hot\
  \ that my skin burns in just a few minutes. I wanted to buy sunscreen the other\
  \ day but for some reason, I could only find SPF six or one hundred, nothing in\
  \ between. Unable to choose one or the other, I ended up purchasing a bronzing cream\
  \ with sun protection that seems to have no effect whatsoever.\n \nMy current commute\
  \ involves a half-hour ride on the 'Ecovia', which is kind of like a metro-bus.\
  \ Sometimes, if I am lucky, the bus is half-empty, and it is possible to stand without\
  \ having my inner organs squashed (finding an empty seat never happens). Other times,\
  \ it is so crowded I don't know how any of us survive traveling from one place to\
  \ the next. People on the platform push like it is a matter of life and death but\
  \ in fact, it would probably safer to stay there than it is to board the bus. On\
  \ the other hand, my fellow commuters are quite interesting to watch. While I am\
  \ breathing through my nose and trying not to panic, the Ecuadorians around me happily\
  \ snack on fried bananas, change dirty diapers or shower each other with public\
  \ displays of affection. \n\nOnce I arrive at my stop, the climb starts. The second\
  \ part of my daily trip to work consists of a fifteen-minute walk uphill so by the\
  \ time I reach the language school where I am now teaching, I am panting and sweating.\
  \ Not for long, however, as it is always absolutely freezing the inside the building.\
  \ Even when it feels like it is a hundred degrees outside and people are sunbathing\
  \ in the garden, I need three layers of clothes and a thick jacket just to get through\
  \ the day in the classroom.\n\nLast weekend, I took a taxi to meet my friends in\
  \ the historical center of Quito and somewhere along the way, the driver got lost.\
  \ He stopped by the side of the road to ask for directions and called a man's attention\
  \ by yelling: \"Oye, flaco! - Hey, skinny one!\" The skinny man approached the car,\
  \ told us how to get to my destination and when my driver thanked him, he responded\
  \ with: \"De nada, gordo. - You're welcome, fat one.\" Neither of them seemed the\
  \ least bit offended. Meanwhile, I hid silently in the back of the taxi, hoping\
  \ they wouldn't address me in any way.\n \nActually, I don't know how much I would\
  \ have minded. I may never get to a point where I feel comfortable commenting on\
  \ other people's physical appearance in such a blunt way, but I am learning how\
  \ to not find it offensive. In addition, practicing yoga daily has taught me how\
  \ to love my own body and accept it exactly as it is. Sometimes I am 'gorda', sometimes\
  \ I am 'flaca' and both are fine. Both are beautiful. More important than what my\
  \ body looks like is what it can do. It can move, it can dance, and it can climb\
  \ to the top of the mountains surrounding my momentary home here in the middle of\
  \ the world. Right now, I am going to wrap myself up in a warm blanket and get ready\
  \ for the chilly night. \n\nJust need to put some lotion on the sunburns first."
