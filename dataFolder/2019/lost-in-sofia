Text: Having a trip while you are an engineer student is really hard. Basically impossible
  due to the strict programme. So my co-student and friend, and I decided to go for
  four days to Sofia after the semester exams (February). We planned this trip in
  a few days so we didnt know exactly what to expect there. When we arrived we went
  straight to the hotel, and the owner firstly asked us if we are from Greece, and
  we said yes. So, he started speaking greek, and that time I felt so intimate and
  welcome to this place. The day after we wanted to visit the zoo at sofia. We searched
  the metro lines and we found the most fast way to go there. We took the metro, and
  a bus, and we were right outside the zoo park; it was closed. We couldnt find a
  bus and my friend said we could return on foot. My phone dropped dead because it
  was freezing, and my friends phone had no signal. So we were stuck, walking to the
  unknown, without communication, and it was getting dark. So, we started walking,
  passing by museums, statues, parks and amazing restaurants at non-touristic regions.
  This trip, and especially this unfortunate moment changed my whole travelling perspective.
  We shouldnt always break the mould, we should open our own paths, trust our instincts
  and feel free. That's what travelling is about.
