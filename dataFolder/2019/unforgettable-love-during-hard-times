Text: "One February in Nicaragua, I fell in love. I fell in love with the warm breeze\
  \ that rattled the fronds of the palm trees. I fell in love with the sweet smell\
  \ of flowers and coffee. I fell in love with the waves that lapped against my surfboard.\
  \ And I fell in love with the bronze-skinned boy with bleach blonde hair who danced\
  \ across the waves on his short board. One night, feeling daring, I led him down\
  \ to the beach, shedding my clothes, and we swam naked in the ocean under the full\
  \ moon. We shared kisses, long talks under the stars, mixed drinks, and his twin\
  \ bed in an open-air hut surrounded by the crowing of roosters.\nAs soon as I left,\
  \ I knew I had to go back. That August I returned, but this time to a Nicaragua\
  \ wrought by political strife and a government who killed innocent citizens. His\
  \ father had been forced to move to Costa Rica for work, leaving him to care for\
  \ his mother and younger sisters. I did as much as I could. I stuffed my suitcase\
  \ with gifts for him and his family. I stayed a week as the only guest at a surf\
  \ camp, which provided him with a job as a surf instructor. But it wasn\u2019t enough.\
  \ After that, he asked that I buy his breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks each\
  \ day if I wanted to stay in his house with him. I was taken aback, but I loved\
  \ him so I agreed. He resented me for not constantly offering to share my money\
  \ when he was the poor Nicaraguan and I was the \u201Crich American\u201D. It caused\
  \ tension between us, which soon became too much to handle. \nHis Uncle Pedro owned\
  \ a hostel nearby, but I decided to check in to a resort for my birthday. At sunset\
  \ he took us to a fancy restaurant on the motorbike I\u2019d been renting for him\
  \ every day. We drank wine and ate as we watched the sun go down. But I soon realized\
  \ I was short on cash. I let him know, hoping he could lend me some, since I was\
  \ paying for both of us on my birthday. \n\u201CYou\u2019re ruining my reputation!\u201D\
  \ He shouted. \u201CNow everyone\u2019s going to remember that I brought someone\
  \ here who couldn\u2019t even pay for dinner.\u201D I had to take a cab back the\
  \ next day to pay our bill.\nAt his uncle\u2019s hostel, I paid off the tab for\
  \ the motorbike.\n\u201CSo, you\u2019re staying at the resort?\u201D Uncle Pedro\
  \ asked. I nodded, feeling guilty I hadn\u2019t stayed at the hostel. \n\u201CBusiness\
  \ hasn\u2019t been great lately with the political situation affecting tourism.\
  \ But I don\u2019t need lots of money or a nice house to be happy. I have my family\
  \ and friends in this village. Nicaraguan people don\u2019t have much, but we smile\
  \ because we know that true happiness comes from doing your best and being with\
  \ people you love.\u201D\nTears fell silently down my face in the darkness as his\
  \ uncle\u2019s words sunk in.\nAnother week passed of being hurt and ignored before\
  \ I finally decided I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I paid the fee to change my\
  \ flight home and headed to the hostel to return the surfboard I\u2019d been renting.\n\
  \u201CI\u2019m leaving tomorrow,\u201D I told Uncle Pedro, sadly.\n\u201CI\u2019\
  m sorry for what he did to you,\u201D his uncle said. Tears rushed to my eyes. \u201C\
  I don\u2019t know why he would treat you like this after you came here to visit\
  \ him. He\u2019s not family to me. You\u2019re welcome back here anytime. You can\
  \ stay at my hostel and you don\u2019t have to see him.\u201D \nFinally, after weeks\
  \ of being surrounded only by he and his friends, who ignored me and joked around\
  \ in Spanish so I couldn\u2019t join in, somebody was reaching out to me. Someone\
  \ had seen me left alone in a country where I didn\u2019t fit in and couldn\u2019\
  t communicate and, instead of leaving me be, had helped me to my feet. Pedro shared\
  \ with me the love of the Nicaragua I had fallen for all those months before.\n\
  I stepped forward to hug Pedro. \u201CThank you,\u201D I said. \u201CGracias.\u201D"
