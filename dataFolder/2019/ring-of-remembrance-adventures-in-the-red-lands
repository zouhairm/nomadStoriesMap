Text: "Sky blue turquoise shimmered at me from the glass case upon the table before\
  \ me. A hall full of people shuffling around me, preoccupied with buying healing\
  \ stones and spiritual tools. To be honest, this was the last place I wanted to\
  \ be, yet the pull was magnetic to get to this mind/body/spirit event in my local\
  \ town. I now know why. \n\nI slipped the ring onto my finger and the room fell\
  \ away. I was no longer buffered inside from a wild rainy cold November day in the\
  \ west of Ireland, but I had inwardly transported to a vast red rocked plateau with\
  \ an arid intense heat that sank deep into my bones. A place activating ancient\
  \ memories my conscious mind could not fathom. \n\nMy heart expanded and a rush\
  \ of remembrance coursed through my body. I felt a sense of connection to the earth,\
  \ and of home, I had never experienced before. I was captivated by this sudden but\
  \ brief and powerful vision. Where was this place, and how do I get there?  \n\n\
  The ring came home with me that day where it stayed firmly rooted on my left hand.\
  \ It\u2019s intricate design drawing my eye into a different time and place. A place\
  \ that I realized my soul was longing to connect with.  The dark-haired Irish women\
  \ I bought it from mentioned it was a \u201CNavajo healing ring\u201D and it seemed\
  \ it have chosen me; for a destiny yet to be revealed. There was no doubt within\
  \ me that this ring had magical powers; I opened to its gifts.\n\n I listened to\
  \ the ardent call that its presence ushered into my life and I began to instigate\
  \ a journey to the lands it originated from \u2013 that of the American southwest.\
  \ I planned a start point and rough trajectory but the rest of this trip was a blank\
  \ canvas open to the mystery.  \n\nI was nervous and excited. I had never driven\
  \ alone in the US before, so this initially presented some bumps, but I quickly\
  \ navigated my way with persistence and surrender. I knew I was not truly in driving\
  \ seat of this journey; that this was to be an unknown pilgrimage of the soul. \n\
  \nIt was the smell of the desert air that first captured my heart. The aromas of\
  \ junipers & pines mixed with the heady essences of adventures on new lands. \n\n\
  I met Clay, a 6ft white-haired local shamanic guide who reminded me of a mix between\
  \ Merlin the magician and an indigenous native American chief, at my starting point\
  \ in the Verde Valley region of Arizona. We met in a little town called \u201CCottonwood\u201D\
  \ as I wanted to start my journey at a lower altitude (3,156 ft.) and move gradually\
  \ north through Sedona, Flagstaff and into the territories of the Hopi and Navajo\
  \ tribal lands. Clay guided me expertly through Sycamore Canyon, which was home\
  \ to ancient medicine wheels, Pueblo Indian ruins and a vast array of cliff dwellings.\
  \ \n\nBy day three something profound was beginning to open within me with each\
  \ new meeting of place. I was propelled to keep moving north to meet the \u201C\
  Red Lands\u201D from my vision. \n\nNothing could have prepared me for the majestic\
  \ expansive first meeting with the otherworldly town of Sedona. My eyes struggled\
  \ to take in the sheer natural beauty of its vast red rock buttes, tall cliffs and\
  \ almost temple-like rock formations. The colors and contrast of vibrant blue-sky\
  \ meeting striking red earth.\n\nOn the approach from the south, I had to keep reminding\
  \ myself that I was driving a physical vehicle so as not to eject right out of my\
  \ seat and on to the wings of a large hawk that was flying right above my car. I\
  \ was grateful for the hawk\u2019s omen like presence indicating the adventures\
  \ yet to come.\n\nSedona is a mystical and holy place of vision for the native indigenous\
  \ of Arizona. A place to seek higher vision and renowned for its healing earth vortex\
  \ energies.\n\nDeep within me, there was a knowing that this special ring had brought\
  \ me home. \n\nMy feet touched the red earth and I remembered."
