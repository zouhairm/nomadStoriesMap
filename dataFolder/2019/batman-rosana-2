Text: "The alley is darker than I expected. Panting along the narrow cobblestone pathway,\
  \ sliding around each of its sight restricting curves, the strange man slyly continues\
  \ to gesture that I should follow him. I am getting nervous as ice cold sweat runs\
  \ down the back of my neck.\n\n\u201CWhy did I ask for directions?\u201D I think\
  \ to myself. \u201CThey warned me against this. Is this serpent leading me straight\
  \ into the snake\u2019s belly?\u201D Quite ironic for a place referred to as Batman\u2019\
  s alley, or as the locals call it \u201CBeco do Batman\u201D.\n\nWho would have\
  \ thought that this Latin American adventure, with all its lavish experiences and\
  \ extravagant memories, will lose its Brazilian passion right here in the Vila Madalena\
  \ neighborhood of S\xE3o Paulo? At least my final breath will be taken while incurring\
  \ the only expense that has always made me richer\u2026.travel!\n\nWe turn another\
  \ corner and in a flash of light the monochrome pallets in my retinas are splashed\
  \ with a multitude of splendid colours. Green, blue, pink, yellow, orange, red and\
  \ every shading in between. \u201CAm I dead? Is this heaven? Smells a bit \u2018\
  foreign\u2019 for a place that was described in so much splendour.\u201D\n\nThrough\
  \ the deafening effect of the blinding colours, an angelic sound seeps into my ear.\
  \ \u201CWelcome to Batman\u2019s Alley.\u201D A petite, dark haired, olive skinned\
  \ woman, tour guide to a group of Europeans, just became my guardian angel. \u201C\
  I have arrived.\u201D\n\n\u201CBeco do Batman\u201D, a graffiti kingdom of concentrated\
  \ colours, creativity and the inherent expression of humanity frozen in time. This\
  \ eye-opening experience is as foreign to me as the sight of my blonde hair and\
  \ blue eyes to the locals around me. High on an overdose of visual stimulation I\
  \ prompt myself to meet Stranger 591, in my life venture of meeting one stranger\
  \ per day for one thousand days. \u201CWho will I choose?\u201D\n\nI shuffle over\
  \ the cobblestones to the most innocent, least dangerous, meek looking woman I could\
  \ spot in the vicinity. With her old fashioned, loose hanging jersey and thick spectacles\
  \ resting on the tip of her nose, I find some comfort in her librarian appearance.\
  \ \u201COne near death experience per day is enough for me.\u201D\n\n\u201CHello.\
  \ My name is David. I do this thing where I try and meet a stranger every day for\
  \ a thousand days. Would you mind being my stranger?\u201D \u201CEu n\xE3o falo\
  \ ingl\xEAs. Voc\xEA pode falar porteguese?\u201D she starts. All I can hear, as\
  \ her lips move, is the helpless cry of \u201COh boy\u201D in the back of my mind.\
  \ Now I will have to be the one to slyly gesture my request.\n\n\u201CLet the charades\
  \ begin.\u201D I remove the chalk from the little pill case its kept in and start\
  \ performing my one act play. By pointing to myself, articulating my name, pointing\
  \ to her and back onto the board, I explain that she must write her name. Just like\
  \ the scene where Jane tries to retrieve Tarzan\u2019s name. Luckily, the explanation\
  \ of having to take a selfie merely took one gesture as she was all too familiar\
  \ with it. \n\nAfter an eventful performance I managed to meet Stranger 591, Rosana.\
  \ \n\nA nearby spectator walked up to us and offered me his best attempt of broken\
  \ English, inquiring about my venture. Rosana quickly made use of the opportunity\
  \ to discover what exactly she was just the victim of. After what sounded like a\
  \ hot Portuguese\u2019s debate he directed his focus back to me and said, \u201C\
  Rosana thought you were trying to sell her drugs, when you removed the pill case\
  \ from your pocket. She is willing to buy from you but tried to explain that she\
  \ has no cash and can only pay by credit card\u201D. \n\nAt first, I wasn\u2019\
  t sure whether I was overwhelmed by joy or regret. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing\
  \ at the thought that I could have sold a piece of worthless chalk for the market\
  \ value of drugs. Rosana completed our duet as she accompanied me in filling the\
  \ alley with laughter. \n\nTravelling still remains the only expense that makes\
  \ us richer. Even if we miss out on money making opportunities like these from time\
  \ to time. \U0001F60A"
