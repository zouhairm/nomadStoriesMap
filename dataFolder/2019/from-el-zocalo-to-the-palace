Text: "Sitting inside a subway wagon, admiring the efficiency of a transport I never\
  \ used before, I was about to reach the station built under Mexico City\u2019s main\
  \ square, \u201CEl Z\xF3calo\u201D, which would serve as starting point of the first\
  \ tour I would have on my first travel experience ever. I was twenty years old and\
  \ had never been before out from my hometown, an extremely quiet small town just\
  \ a couple of hours away from one of the world\u2019s biggest cities.\n\nWhile growing\
  \ up there I listened several people complaining about Mexico City: pollution, crime,\
  \ crowded places everywhere. That kind of rant installed an unconscious fear inside\
  \ of me; but it was all of it true? Was its only face? On the other hand, through\
  \ books, movies and other media I saw a very different place, rich in culture and\
  \ history. So, when my father, who recently just moved in there, asked me to visit\
  \ him I didn\u2019t think it twice and put myself up for the call of my first traveling\
  \ adventure giving the first step out to discover the world by myself.\n\nMy father\
  \ designed a simple route for my journey: Starting from El Z\xF3calo all the way\
  \ straight across Madero\u2019s street until reach the Palace of fine arts. He knew\
  \ I was carrying some fears due to the prejudices I heard but I insisted on taking\
  \ the adventure on my own. \n\nA set of staircases would get me from the exit of\
  \ the station to the middle of the main square where I would head west always in\
  \ straight line. I climbed each step with the noise of prejudice installed in my\
  \ head. I was not prepared for the visual welcoming I was going to have.\n I came\
  \ out to an immense concrete base surrounded by majestic well-preserved buildings\
  \ around 400 to 300 years old, the firsts built in the beginning of the Spanish\
  \ rule, living witnesses of this country's biography.  In the middle a large Mexican\
  \ flag was waving where according to myth the Aztecs had founded their great empire.\
  \ This place is where it all began for Mexico and I was right in the middle of it\
  \ watching it vibrating history and mysticism. \n\nA beam of light started to clear\
  \ the gray clouds of my worries and it was just the first part of my tour. Madero\
  \ street was next and it was also a unique place just to be and contemplate.\n\n\
  Here I have to admit it is true what people told me about how crowded this place\
  \ can be. Millions of people move across the city (just like in any other megalopolis)\
  \ but Mexican people always find a way to make everything colorful and folkloric,\
  \ and here in Madero it served as an involuntary touristic attraction. As you walk\
  \ across the street you can feel like crossing a sea with several tides, each one\
  \ attracted to one of the many restaurants, stores, churches and museums you can\
  \ find here. The street is a collage that summarizes the density, the needs and\
  \ the different faces you can find of the city laying one next to the other. \n\n\
  At the end of Madero Street, I stumbled upon a magnificent, white marble building\
  \ with Greek-like sculptures on its fa\xE7ade and statues of angels guarding its\
  \ surroundings. The Palace of Fine Arts is the cultural icon of Mexico City and\
  \ one of the most beautiful edifications this country has to offer to the world.\
  \ But also, for me meant the ultimate reward of facing my rookie traveler fears.\
  \ \n\nI sat on one of the benches in the Palace esplanade seeing that beautiful\
  \ building and also contemplating this one of a kind urban vibe that in just one\
  \ kilometer showed me how stepping out from your comfort zone helps tumble down\
  \ the walls built by one-sided opinions and prejudices that often get in the way\
  \ from discovering the many complex and marvelous faces this world has to offer."
