Text: "The Doubletree Hilton in Cluj, Romania, sits on a hill overlooking the modern\
  \ part of the city with its back to the historical University and old town square.\
  \ I\u2019d left our fourth story window open overnight to let in some cool, late\
  \ fall air.  When I awoke it was dark.  Beneath the window, a dog let go a deep,\
  \ full-throated howl.  A moment later I heard a flapping of wings and the shrill\
  \ calls of birds. Lots of them.  I pulled back the curtain and saw thousands of\
  \ black birds flying across my field of view, many of them right by our room.  I\
  \ hurriedly shut the window as they were flying so close to the building I was afraid\
  \ one might fly right in.  The large black birds continued to fly by as the sky\
  \ went from charcoal to dusty rose.  As the flock began to thin and I could see\
  \ farther out across the horizon I saw large clouds of the birds moving together\
  \ over the city.  I felt suddenly cold, standing in my nightgown and bare feet in\
  \ front of the window.  I had been exploring Transylvania for almost a week, driving\
  \ through deep forests and visiting old towns and castles including the one which\
  \ had inspired Bram Stoker's Dracula.  I didn't expect to find myself viscerally\
  \ connected to images and sensations from that story as I was at that moment, standing\
  \ in the dark, listening to a dog howl, enveloped in a murmuration of starlings."
