Text: "Weirdly enough for a February morning, I was sunbathing. That is such a luxury\
  \ in a country like Denmark, and even more so on a winter day, when Scandinavians\
  \ normally get very few hours of sunlight. I was writing, probably just for the\
  \ pleasure of drawing lines on my notebook, feeling grateful for the longed-for\
  \ rays that penetrated my skin at that moment. I tried to describe the atmosphere\
  \ around me: Copenhageners walked by, biked and drank beers with their friends sittting\
  \ at the N\xF8rrebro bridge, the place they go to every time it\u2019s a little\
  \ bit sunny in the city to do their much needed photosynthesis.\n\nThen a man came\
  \ up to me, interrupting my peace with his bitter, non-ignorable smell of beer.\
  \ He was wearing some sort of street cleaning uniform and carried a bag full of\
  \ used containers. In Denmark, it\u2019s not unusual to see people \u2014mostly\
  \ immigrants\u2014 searching in the trash cans for used bottles, cans or anything\
  \ they can later introduce into the machines that collect waste for recycling and\
  \ gives them money in exchange. \n\n\"Oh, you write too!\u201D, said the man in\
  \ a tone of surprise, as he approached my bench. Assuming by his expression that\
  \ he also was some kind of writer, I offered him a sheet of paper and a pen so that\
  \ he could rest for a few minutes, write whatever he wanted, and enjoy that rare\
  \ Danish sunshine. He agreed and sat next to me. It must had been a pretty comical\
  \ scene to watch, or at least that was the impression I got from the grimaces of\
  \ the passers-by: This old man, who almost looked like Santa Claus carrying a bag\
  \ of garbage \u2014although, to him, it was probably more like a sack of gold\u2014\
  \ and me, a much younger girl with a completely different look, both tapping our\
  \ pens on our respective striped sheets of paper, thinking about what to write.\
  \ \n\nNaturally, I tried to talk to him first, but he didn't seem to understand\
  \ English very well (or maybe it was my English \u2014and strong Spanish accent\u2014\
  \ he didn't quite understand). I asked him what he was going to write about. \"\
  I'm going to tell my story,\" he said, and added: \u201CI\u2019ll do it in my language,\
  \ that of the Faroe Islands\u201D. I couldn\u2019t hide my excitement. This man,\
  \ who for some unknown reason ended up collecting trash for a living \u2014in one\
  \ of the most egalitarian countries in the world\u2014, is going to give me, a perfect\
  \ stranger, his story. The most precious gift of all. \u201CThere\u2019s no way\
  \ I\u2019ll understand his language, but I will translate it the minute I get home\u201D\
  \ I planned. I stopped writing. I couldn't concentrate. I imagined, as in the tale\
  \ of The Milk-Maid's Dream, all the interesting things he could explain to me about\
  \ his homeland, about his departure from the Faroe Islands and his life as what\
  \ it seemed to be a Copenhagen bum. I wondered if he would identify with the separatist\
  \ movement of the islands, which for years has been trying to hold a referendum\
  \ on whether or not they should be independent from Denmark. And my questions wouldn\u2019\
  t stop\u2026 Which might his position be on the controversy over the whale hunt\
  \ that, to Faroese people\u2019s disgrace, puts these islands on the map every summer?\
  \ Is he treated as an \u201Cimmigrant\u201D in a country that is both the land of\
  \ the cradle-to-grave welfare state and the home to a spreading very alarming xenophobia?\
  \  \n\nI suddenly got out of my bubble of wonder, now bursted thanks to the sound\
  \ of a pen being pressed, anxiously and repeatedly, against a ripped piece of paper.\
  \ Of course it was my new friend, who \u2014like a child that has been caught in\
  \ fraganti\u2014 was laughing madly while he scribbled, ceaselessly and ignoring\
  \ my visible disappointment, what I thought would be his story. And maybe it was."
