Text: "After all my trips around the world, came the day my family and friends hugged\
  \ me in a different way like it was the last goodbye and said: BE CAREFUL! None\
  \ of them asked for gifts or told me to enjoy, I heard nothing that day but BE CAREFUL!\n\
  \ In a blink of an eye, I was in a hotel lobby surrounded by grumpy faces and weird\
  \ long costumes in the middle of a dark night. with a heart beating fast, fear and\
  \ some regret, prayers were unconsciously spoken, please God! Please God! my family,\
  \ my cat and my favorite lemon tree in the front yard became only a wish that moment.\n\
  8:15 am\nLonely in my room, opening the curtains seeking serenity and sun light,\
  \ but heavy smog I got, and with heavy heart I started my first day in Pakistan.\n\
  In my first meeting of international youth summit in Lahore, where I was participating\
  \ to share my experience in education, inside the full university hall, and before\
  \ panels started, with the warmest welcoming words my name was surprisingly announced\
  \ and I was asked for a short speech, in that exact moment my heart felt the relief\
  \ and with a joy smoothly said: it\u2019s my pleasure to be here. Magically, Long\
  \ hours started to pass fast, faces became familiar, and constant Checking of my\
  \ location on snapchat map was no longer a surprise. With days full of meetings,\
  \ lectures, locals and international delegates, everything was fine, I was in Pakistan\
  \ and I was getting used to that!\nAfter being busy for few days, and meeting new\
  \ people who quickly became friends, time for some fun finally came and excitement\
  \ began. A middle eastern girl with her local male friend exploring the huge city\
  \ of Lahore. Walking for hours into the unknown breathing smoggy air, jumping from\
  \ one taxi to another rickshaw, discovering different parts of the city and spreading\
  \ love by a smile from the heart was absolutely a satisfying experience.\nWas this\
  \ the real Pakistan I\u2019ve been told about! what about terrorist, bombs, blood\
  \ and died bodies? How about long scary beards, guns and random shooting? None of\
  \ that was there, I found nothing but beauty and love, all the black ideas in my\
  \ head disappeared, the frighten heart who landed few days ago was no longer here,\
  \ the dusty glass was finally clean and the picture became clear.\nWhen you open\
  \ your heart, details become titles and everything around becomes interesting, All\
  \ the crowded streets and the attractive traditional markets, the sound of an inapprehensible\
  \ Urdu for a middle eastern ear, that warm breezes in November, fast beats on taxi\
  \ radio, noisy engines of rickshaws, big families easily riding one motorcycle,\
  \ the spicy delicious food, the captivating oud fragrant in the fancy malls, the\
  \ tasty chai, the rich culture with all the colors, music, and dances, the amazing\
  \ architecture with the wonderful buildings, the special huge mosques and breathtaking\
  \ Sufi performance, but the most important was the hospitality of locals warmly\
  \ welcoming us with beautiful fresh roses. It was not heaven, neither I was dreaming,\
  \ it was just the beautiful land of Pakistan and I was gradually falling in love\
  \ with everything I see.\nFor every beginning comes an end, after an unexpected\
  \ great experience, time for goodbye sadly came. Leaving that country and its\u2019\
  \ people was not easy, not because of checkpoints neither airport policies, but\
  \ fond heart was not ready to go home. destiny strangely spoke that trip and charm\
  \ took place. In the country I never pictured myself in, a Pakistani heart opened\
  \ and I was the guest, LOVE WAS FOUND, and for a lifetime I got my precious souvenir."
