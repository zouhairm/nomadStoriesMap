Text: "I woke up to the sensation of falling. Literally. My fragile body was thrown\
  \ helplessly across my bed as the unforgiving waves threatened to hijack the 40ft.\
  \ Yacht. The creaky wall caught me with a hard thud on my back. I had been warned\
  \ previously that the waves of New Zealand were rough, but I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to experience 30 knots of wind during my first sail crossing.\n\nBeing a recent\
  \ graduate from a Media Arts degree, you couldn\u2019t blame me for accepting the\
  \ opportunity. When I received the news that I had been chosen to Film and Edit\
  \ a YouTube Channel in New Zealand, I was instantly excited. The catch? I had to\
  \ live on a Yacht. I, however, only heard \u201Ctravel the world,\u201D so I packed\
  \ my bags and decided to ignore the fact that I had never sailed in my life. I arrived\
  \ in Auckland with expectations beyond reality.\n\nThe boat chopped through the\
  \ dangerous Pacific Ocean as if it had no sense of direction. Due to my cabin being\
  \ under the bow, I could feel each wave lifting the yacht into the air, only to\
  \ then crash head-first into the violent sea. With my nose stinging from the strong\
  \ scent of salt water, I re-positioned my body to avoid falling again. With nothing\
  \ to listen to, except for the loud and angry waves that slapped against the hull,\
  \ it would\u2019ve been too easy to succumb my thoughts into the horrific possibilities.\
  \ I forced myself to not imagine the boat being dragged under a blanket of infinite\
  \ water. I reminded myself stay positive, despite knowing that my life was in the\
  \ hands of just two people who worked tirelessly throughout the storm. That night\
  \ was a dreamless one, as I was living inside a nightmare.\n\nThe next morning,\
  \ I woke up to a peaceful ocean, as if it were apologising for the agonising night.\
  \ Shaking, I climbed up to the deck and breathed in the fresh air. We were enclosed\
  \ by an island that carried high mountains. As beautiful as the views were, I realised\
  \ in that moment how isolated I was. I had pushed my body and mental strength to\
  \ the limit so I decided to say goodbye to this chapter in my life. Naive and young,\
  \ I had leapt into the unknown and to this day it remains the craziest challenge\
  \ I have faced. But with every experience comes life-long lessons and I am excited\
  \ to continue growing with each new adventure."
