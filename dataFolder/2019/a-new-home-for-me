Text: "Friends, fashion, fun, and a host of other f\u2019s I looked forward to but\
  \ I forgot to account for the most dreaded F- French. You\u2019re probably judging\
  \ me, you\u2019re thinking, how do you plan to attend language summer school in\
  \ France but forget to brush up your French? I know, I know, rookie mistake. I imagined\
  \ my many hours of eagerly answering in Monsieur E\u2019s lessons would pay off.\
  \ \n \nHowever, arriving at Charles de Gaulle, running on three hours of sleep,\
  \ figuring out which line to be on and finally settling for \u2018internationale\u2019\
  , I soon realised that those lessons had not paid off. This was about to be an interesting\
  \ summer.\n \nNext, my other rookie mistake or maybe the Brit in me, I screamed\
  \ \u2018good morning!\u2019 at the immigration personnel. He takes a good look at\
  \ me, confirms it to be the same person on my document then proceeds to flip over\
  \ to my passport cover. The bold \u2018Bon Voyage\u2019 clearly confuses him, surely,\
  \ if I had made the effort to connect through the little details of my document,\
  \ I should be able to say a simple \u2018bonjour\u2019. The first lesson learnt.\n\
  \ \nI had never been to France before and even worse, I had never even heard of\
  \ Le Mans. I clearly didn't speak any meaningful amount of French, so I'm in CDG\
  \ train station, looking at my ticket to this obscure place, wondering what I  was\
  \ thinking coming here.  \n \nGetting to Le Mans was an interesting experience in\
  \ itself. The large, multi-layered trains were a nice surprise with actually designated\
  \ luggage racks, big enough for more than one person! Go France! \nI\u2019m greeted\
  \ in Le Mans by a student ambassador. He seems excited to meet me, he spews out\
  \ a few greetings to me. Blank stare. I had never heard those variations before,\
  \ this is going to be hard! He manages to explain everything again in English and\
  \ helps me onto the tram. \n \nI get my first glimpse of Le Mans now. A long tramline,\
  \ a few interesting looking food places, Carrefours dotted about. The city is unlike\
  \ anywhere I have ever been to. It looks quaint, small, delicate, almost like it\u2019\
  s been trapped in a time capsule. It made me think. If a movie needed a scene from\
  \ the medieval times, the directors would do well coming here. It seemed it had\
  \ missed the modernisation every city needs. But, not in a dull way but in a way,\
  \ that reminds you that culture lies behind those old, high walls and if those cobbled\
  \ streets had mouths, they would never be able to shut up. A memorable building\
  \ was the one that had etched on it that \u2018the law of the Lord will never die\u2019\
  . It told the story of a building that was not destroyed when the bombings happened.\
  \ On its other side, it had a beautiful white statute whose hand brings good luck\
  \ but I was more interested in the crepe places it seemed to create a landmark for.\
  \ \n \nThen I get to see what this city is hallowed for. It\u2019s 24 hours race\
  \ track. I even get told the exact spot Patrick Dempsey stood in while receiving\
  \ his award there. I\u2019m also sipping mocktails at bars Brad Pitt had been. The\
  \ pictures on the wall tell me that this is the glory of this place. Even Hollywood\
  \ A-listers are around making a movie about this place and its famous race tracks.\
  \ I wondered how this unassuming small town seemed to juxtapose itself. I'm thinking\
  \ in English though, I'm still struggling with the lingua franca.\n \nNothing seemed\
  \ new anymore. I had seen it all and I loved it all but my final bond was in my\
  \ last week. It involved chanting \u2018Allez le bleus\u2019, screaming every French\
  \ word I had learnt, in hopes that somehow, this national team would hear me and\
  \ at least someone would get their \u2018it\u2019s coming home\u2019 dream. My magic\
  \ trick worked of course! Finally, juggling between \u2018we are the champions\u2019\
  \ and \u2018Allez, Allez Allez\u2019 with some of the happiest people on earth at\
  \ that moment, I realised that this once obscure place seemed to love me as much\
  \ as I loved it."
