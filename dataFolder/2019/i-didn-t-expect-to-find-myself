Text: "You know everyone says that they find themselves while travelling. Backpacking\
  \ in Europe or going on that solo trip that will change their whole life. Yes, I\
  \ found myself whilst travelling on two separate occasions. I think the first time\
  \ set me up for success, even if I didn\u2019t know it at the time. I wasn\u2019\
  t \u201Csolo\u201D as such or in Europe. \n\nSo it all started in 2014, I was going\
  \ through what I still believe was the saddest time of my life. The \u201Clove of\
  \ my life\u201D had broken my heart after falling deep into depression. I found\
  \ myself falling and after the breakup, my life was still so devoted to his. In\
  \ and out of \u201Clet\u2019s get back together\u201D or \u201Cit\u2019s not the\
  \ right time\u201D. \n\nI spent most of my 2014 trying to make someone else happy.\
  \ Then, an opportunity came up. The degree I was studying at university was offering\
  \ an amazing study tour to Malaysia and Singapore. My love for travel and my degree\
  \ was all pieced together, me a year before would have NEVER applied for something\
  \ like this. \n\nBut I did it, I wrote the application and sent before I could rethink\
  \ my choices. \n\nI didn\u2019t have confidence, self-esteem or much motivation,\
  \ not like I did years before. But that was the beginning, the beginning of my journey\
  \ to finding myself and finding that drive that made me, well me. The big dreamer,\
  \ self-motivated, goal lover. \n\nSo the time came, the time to pack my bags and\
  \ head to the country I had never been before with people I had met once, this was\
  \ definitely overstepping my comfort zone. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to go, it was\
  \ a time in my life that my \u201Clove\u201D was interested in taking me back, for\
  \ now maybe the sixth time, so going away for what felt like months was not what\
  \ I wanted. But I went and wow, what it brought me was something you couldn\u2019\
  t do without pushing yourself out of complete comfort. \n\nOn this trip, I learnt\
  \ how to have confidence in what I could achieve, to open myself up to new possibilities\
  \ in MY life, to make MYSELF happy and to build connections that would soon motivate\
  \ me to be the best version of myself. \n\nBut, it wasn\u2019t all fabulous, I hit\
  \ a blow when the hotel cleaner thought feeling me up whilst putting my shoes on\
  \ one morning was appropriate and in that minute, all the confidence came falling\
  \ down. Hours spent in the police station telling my story to someone who didn\u2019\
  t speak English. \n\nHowever, with every trauma, we learn, we become resilient and\
  \ we remember that things happen for a reason. I was meant to go on the study tour,\
  \ I was meant to learn that not one person gives me meaning or 'purpose'. \n\nMy\
  \ purpose? Is to inform and educate the world. I do this through my life experiences\
  \ and from my mistakes, then I express this to everyone who needs that second wind\
  \ to keep on pushing through! \n\nThe second time I found myself again? On a trip\
  \ to Vietnam - yes I\u2019m sensing a pattern too. So this now motivated, goal achieving,\
  \ self-loving traveller was always driven by measuring success. When you go travelling,\
  \ sometimes it is hard to measure this success. Did you exercise today? Did you\
  \ write in your journal today? No and no. \n\nSo I was judging myself when I didn\u2019\
  t work on goals or routine. Until I realised, travel is for going outside the routine,\
  \ for missing a workout, getting drunk on a Wednesday and eating street food in\
  \ the early hours. That\u2019s why we love it, it is a world where worries are left\
  \ behind and all you\u2019re left with is yourself, your memories and the stories.\n\
  \nHow did I find myself through travelling? I found the motivated, goal driven girl\
  \ who works hard in life and I found the girl who will love me no matter if I have\
  \ a day off \u2018life\u2019 because I just want to be free. \n\nI found myself\
  \ because I found that loving yourself is the most important part of life."
