Text: "The taxi driver isn\u2019t comfortable with me getting out of the car.\n\n\u201C\
  Are you sure this is the right place? It looks like it\u2019s going to be demolished\u201D\
  \ he says. \n\nAnd it does. The house is one of the only buildings left intact in\
  \ half a suburban block full of rubble and a skeleton of white, graffiti-covered\
  \ walls.\n\nThe situation doesn\u2019t look ideal, but I get out anyway. I notice\
  \ the look of concern on his face as he drives away, leaving me to try and find\
  \ my way into the beige, two-storey house on the corner of Rua Aruj\xE1 and Rua\
  \ Chu\xED, which lies just at the lip of the descent into Villa Mariana, one of\
  \ many sloping suburbs in S\xE3o Paulo.\n\nI make my way through the creaky, brown\
  \ metal gate with a large backpack, and ring the doorbell, but no one answers, even\
  \ after several tries. Maybe the taxi driver was right, and this is the wrong place.\
  \ \n\nBut I knew this had to be it. I decide to walk down to the perpendicular strip\
  \ of houses on the same block, the other still-intact buildings. I ring another\
  \ doorbell, and someone does answer, a lady with short black hair that introduces\
  \ herself as Flor.\n\nI explain my situation in English, and with a reassuringly\
  \ clear understanding of what's happening, she walks with me back up the incline\
  \ to the house on the corner, where the taxi driver left me, reluctantly.\n\nAfter\
  \ she punches in the security code, we walk into a stale but not uninviting, closed-curtain\
  \ stillness. She shouts \u201COi!\u201D into the house from the lounge cum foyer,\
  \ which is endearingly decorated with cartoon figurines. But after a few shouts,\
  \ it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s absolutely no one there.\n\nI\u2019m assured\
  \ that this is actually Paradiso Hostel when she calls one of the owners, Luciano,\
  \ and then tells me that the lady who works there, Ana, will be there soon to show\
  \ me my room. \n\nFlor leaves, and Ana, a short and portly woman with a round, drawn\
  \ face and dark hair arrives, and takes me up the stairs to the second floor, to\
  \ the room I booked via email with one of the other hostel owners, Lu\xEDs. It\u2019\
  s the double room with the brightly coloured sofa chair and more figurines. \n\n\
  She says something about Luciano, and I understand that he\u2019ll be there to introduce\
  \ himself too, at some stage.\n\nThe fact that I\u2019m alone in a hostel in the\
  \ middle of S\xE3o Paulo, with half a demolished street block next to me, and no\
  \ Portuguese, probably should have made me feel slightly vulnerable, but I feel\
  \ calm and relaxed. It\u2019s probably something to do with the soothing afternoon\
  \ light that comes in through the window when I open up the brown, metal, roll-top\
  \ blinds.\n\nWhen Luciano eventually does knock on my door, and comes in, he's completely\
  \ lit up, like he\u2019s entering onto a stage.\n\nI\u2019m completely transfixed.\
  \ Mostly by his nose-ring. Time seems to slow down considerably as I shake his hand.\
  \ I feel excitement mixed with relief as I realise he speaks really good English.\n\
  \nI spend the next hour or so with him downstairs in the lounge cum foyer, while\
  \ he shows me a hand-drawn map of the area. Some nearby places are crossed out.\n\
  \nHe suggests that I spend the afternoon at Ibirapuera Park, and offers the use\
  \ of one of the hostel\u2019s bikes to get there. He says he\u2019ll also show me\
  \ the way, en route to his lip piercing appointment.\n\nI half ride, half push the\
  \ bike up the hill to Rua Vergueiro with him way ahead of me, consistently checking\
  \ back to see if I'm still there. At the paved pedestrian area at the intersection\
  \ of Avenida Bernadino de Campos and Avenida 23 de Maio, in view of the Greek Orthodox\
  \ Church, he stops and says he'll be heading downtown from this point, but we'll\
  \ see each other back at the hostel later.\n\nWith only offline Google Maps to help\
  \ me, I head west and take on the descending incline through Paraiso\u2019s tree-lined\
  \ streets, packed tightly with tall condominium buildings, all the way downhill\
  \ to the park, with a smile."
