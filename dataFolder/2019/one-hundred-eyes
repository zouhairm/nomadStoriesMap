Text: "One hundred eyes staring at me.\nThe air filled with the song of cicadas hidden\
  \ in the bushes. The fresh breeze of the night, on the river of that small lake,\
  \ makes me shiver in my little black, borrowed dress. \nIn my head, only a fistful\
  \ of seconds to recall that strange adventure, to ask myself that question again:\
  \ \u201CHow did I get here?\u201D\n\u201CI will be waiting for you in Petrozavodsk!\u201D\
  \ While looking for a language school in Russia on Facebook, I happened to be the\
  \ winner of a free 4-lessons course with Olga, a Russian teacher, on Skype. And\
  \ that\u2019s how she ended our last conversation. \nPetrozavodsk: a small village\
  \ in Karelia, 1.000 km far from Moscow, the city where I planned to spend the summer\
  \ after my Master thesis, working for an Italian company.\nCome on, can I imagine\
  \ myself traveling alone to a village in the middle of nowhere, on a Russian night\
  \ train? 1.000 km to spend time with a complete stranger whom I met through Skype\u2026\
  \ Never in life!\n\u201CIt can be fun to visit you on the weekend of my birthday,\
  \ what do you think?\u201D \u201CI would be more than happy to host you at my place!\u201D\
  \nThose little, crazy moments, when you don\u2019t know what happens: when your\
  \ heart pushes you where your mind would never allow you to go.\nJaroslavskij train\
  \ station, Moscow. July 23rd, 23 pm. A small rucksack on my shoulders, train tickets\
  \ in my hand. Getting ready for the kind of night one can expect to spend on Russian\
  \ trains: narrow, hundreds of kilometers long\u2026 And always liven up by a sleeping\
  \ companion who takes out of his bag some Russian delicatessen and shares them with\
  \ you in the morning.\nPetrozavodsk train station. July 24th, 7 am. A small rucksack\
  \ on my shoulders, train tickets in my hand. \u201CYou will instantly recognize\
  \ me, I will have a big, red rose, pinned on my shirt\u201D. Kind of a romantic,\
  \ blind meeting. \nThe doors open, I put a foot in front of the other, going down\
  \ a couple of steps that divide me from the unknown. I turn my head right and then\
  \ left, in that tiny station, in the midst of unfamiliar faces and places. \nSuddenly\
  \ I see a big, red rose. I raise my eyes \u2013 but not that much! Olga is staring\
  \ at me, waving her hands: a short girl, with a blond ponytail, and a ton of mascara\
  \ on her eyelash. \u201CVot ona! (Here she is). Worry fades away, making way for\
  \ the famous Russian hospitality that I had heard so much of. \nOn her vintage Panda\
  \ car, we ride on the narrow and dismal streets of Petrozavodsk, driving past groceries,\
  \ stands and high buildings from the Soviet times. We stop just in front of one\
  \ of them: my home for the next few days.\n\u201CMake yourself comfortable, have\
  \ a shower, put some makeup on\u2026 We are going to a wedding party this afternoon!\u201D\
  \ \u201C\u2026wedding\u2026?\u201D I try to protest. \u201CNu, davaj! (Oh, come\
  \ on!) No excuses, no worries: having an Italian girl visiting is a rare event here!\
  \ My friend insisted so much to have you as a special guest at her wedding, you\
  \ must come!\u201D\nOne hundred eyes staring at me.\nThe air filled with the song\
  \ of cicadas hidden in the bushes. Guests waiting in their party dresses, full of\
  \ expectations. On the tables, deliciousness worthy of a king.\nAn Italian girl,\
  \ with a microphone in her hand. 3.000 km away from home, in a town, she didn\u2019\
  t even know the existence of just a couple of months before. A stranger who had\
  \ been welcomed by warm people who opened their hearts, wanting her to be part of\
  \ such an intimate moment.\n\u201CDavaj, Anna!\u201D (Go, Anna!) \u201CI wish Alina\
  \ and Aleksej all the best for their life together with a song! Felicit\xE0\u2026\
  \ \xE8 tenersi per mano, andare lontano, la felicit\xE0\u201D Russian people love\
  \ Albano, the Italian singer.\nFelicit\xE0 - happiness - is to be welcomed with\
  \ open arms and to make great, unexpected friends. \nHappiness is traveling: when\
  \ your heart pushes you where your mind would never allow you to go."
