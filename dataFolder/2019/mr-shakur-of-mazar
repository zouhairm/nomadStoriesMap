Text: "\u2018Under no circumstances are you to leave the airport alone. Call Mr Shakur\
  \ when you land; he has your flight details and will meet you inside the terminal.\u2019\
  \ This is the directive issued by the security specialist before embarking on my\
  \ excursion. Unequivocal instructions that should be easy to follow. \n\nYet, within\
  \ minutes of arriving at Mazar-i-Sharif International Airport I am about to disobey\
  \ these orders.\n\nMr Shakur, a personal friend of the security specialist, advises\
  \ me he doesn\u2019t have the requisite accreditation to pass beyond the front gate.\
  \ \u2018It is just a short walk to main carpark, where I am waiting Mr Aaron\u2019\
  \ he reassures me. On an ordinary day in New Zealand, second in the latest Global\
  \ Peace Index ratings, this is a perfectly reasonable compromise. But I am momentarily\
  \ stranded in the fourth largest city of Afghanistan, ranked a lowly 162 in the\
  \ same index. A long way from home. \n\nWith little choice other than to accept\
  \ the impromptu meeting point, I reluctantly amble away from the relative safety\
  \ of the terminal\u2019s mirrored-glass fa\xE7ade toward an unknown Mr Shakur. Beads\
  \ of sweat have appeared on my forehead, which I attribute to nerves currently taking\
  \ hold rather than the 36-degree heat. I shouldn\u2019t be walking a road lined\
  \ with sand-filled blast barriers on both sides. A physical reminder of the Taliban\u2019\
  s active, but diminished, presence in Balkh province. As are the Afghan soldiers\
  \ brandishing antique automatic weapons stationed at the entrance outpost. \n\n\
  To detract from my anxiousness I begin to scan the carpark as approaching the checkpoint,\
  \ wondering how I will recognise Mr Shakur. Salutations are used almost exclusively\
  \ to address teachers or elders back home yet is commonplace here. I needn\u2019\
  t have bothered because he has already spotted me. \u2018Mr Aaron\u2019 he waves\
  \ in my direction, \u2018over here.\u2019\n\nOf similar age to me in his mid-thirties,\
  \ Mr Shakur is wearing traditional attire of khet partug, loose upper and lower\
  \ garments, and maroon vest adorned with gold embroidery. His welcoming smile immediately\
  \ puts me at ease as he extends his hand and greets me with \u2018As-Salaam-Alaikum\u2019\
  , \u2018peace be upon you.\u2019 I accept his handshake and respond in kind with\
  \ \u2018Alaikum-Salaam\u2019, followed by placing our hands over our hearts. With\
  \ formalities completed, it\u2019s time to head to the exquisite Shrine of Hazrat\
  \ Ali, from which the city of Mazar derives its name. \n\nMr Shakur steers me towards\
  \ our transport for the day, a decrepit late-80s Toyota Corolla hatchback. At a\
  \ quick glance it appears not a single panel has escaped damage. Dents, scratches\
  \ and frayed nerves abound, I allow myself a brief chuckle as I hop in to the passenger\
  \ seat. A few hours ago I was cocooned in an armoured Land Cruiser, in the capital\
  \ Kabul. \u2018At least we\u2019ll blend in\u2019 I reassure myself; Corollas account\
  \ for 90 percent of all vehicles registered in Afghanistan. Hiding in plain sight.\
  \ \n\nAfter a 20-minute drive along a highway of barren tracts of land and industrial\
  \ parks, we\u2019ve arrived at the shrine complex, occupying four city blocks. Ringed\
  \ by well-manicured gardens, pathways with shaded nooks and water features, the\
  \ twin turquoise domes and ceramic tile cladding of the mosque gleam in the midday\
  \ sun. Entering through the eastern gate, my excitement to experience such history\
  \ is matched by Mr Shakur\u2019s pride to share it with me. \n\nA flurry a notable\
  \ facts ensue; it marks the supposed burial location of prophet Muhammad\u2019s\
  \ cousin and son-in-law; Genghis Khan and his marauding Mongol army demolished the\
  \ original structure in the 13th century; should a dove with coloured feathers stay\
  \ for 40 days it will turn pure white due to the shrine\u2019s holiness. Everything\
  \ I wanted to know, and more, was right on the tip of Mr Shakur\u2019s tongue. \
  \ \n\nWhat began as a mission to visit Afghanistan\u2019s most revered religious\
  \ site, ended in awe of my vastly knowledgeable and hospitable chaperone. I offer\
  \ my hand in gratitude as we ended our circuit of the shrine, accompanied by \u2018\
  taschakor\u2019 Mr Shakur. \u2018Thank you.\u2019"
