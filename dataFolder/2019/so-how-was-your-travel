Text: "When you are planning a traveleveryone around you immediately start shooting\
  \ their recommendations about what things you should do or what places you should\
  \ go while you visit those cities that you have only imagined in your mind or watched\
  \ on movies. The reality is that nothing prepares you for leaving your country for\
  \ the first time, not even the fact that you have bought your tickets convinced\
  \ that your plans include a safe turn back home. \n\nPerhaps for some of you that\
  \ are used to travel a lot have already forgotten the excitement of getting on to\
  \ that car with wings for the first time: the feeling of looking around and watching\
  \ so many sits being so close to each other and then look up and see the people\
  \ sat in them, travelers who are also as nervous as you are who are secretly wishing\
  \ to get sit next to the window so they can admire those landscapes and observe\
  \ that beautiful sunrise, the last before departing to unexplored lands. \n\nMaybe\
  \ you get lucky and next to you is sitted this random person who manages to both\
  \ keep you interested and be interested in what you are talking about: the last\
  \ book you read or which places you're going to visit while you are in Germany or\
  \ in France and then he or she exchanges you their own personal experience about\
  \ those places (because, of course, you got so so lucky that your now \"travel friend\"\
  \ has visited almost all the same places where you're going and so you get even\
  \ more recommendations than before, which are welcomed and somehow make you feel\
  \ less nervous about flying many miles above the floor and far away from home.\n\
  \nMeanwhile this whole conversation happens you never turned to see your cellphone\
  \ and realized that your journey through the skies is almost done which means that\
  \ you\u2019re a couple of minutes away from one of your most crazy and wild dreams.\
  \ Your heart starts to make a noice in the inside, it feels like a bomb about to\
  \ explode and throw fireworks of happiness. And you haven't even left the plane!\n\
  \nYou have traveled for around a month, you\u2019ve visited -as locals seem to call\
  \ it- Deutschland and have been amazed by all these extraordinary tall churches\
  \ filled with thousands of years of history, like the Ulmer M\xFCnster or the Cathedral\
  \ of Ulm, the tallest of all the country which really looks like a beautiful arquitectonic\
  \ monster. Then you left Germany from the hauptbahnhof of Frankfurt to the Gare\
  \ de l\u2019Est of Par\xEDs to arrive to the famous city of love. And last but not\
  \ least, you took the Eurostar trip which, unfortunately, will not allow you to\
  \ see fishes and whales under the sea as some na\xEFve travelers might expect -that\
  \ included me, don\u2019t worry- but it will allow you to catch up with some news\
  \ from home and rest a little bit before getting to your next adventure.\n\nLondon\
  \ was a dream of mine, if I may speak in first person. To see the first \"Underground\"\
  \ sign is a highlight, and when you get to the 'tube' you experience the rush of\
  \ a big and multifaceted city as London is. You as a tourist have a really long\
  \ list of \"musts do\u201D but getting lost in the middle of this last experience\
  \ abroad should be -and it is- the best recommendation. Because even if you would\
  \ like to see the Changing of The Guard outside Buckingham Palace maybe your body\
  \ is just asking for an extra hour of sleep and your feet are only going to resist\
  \ for a short walk around Notting Hill.\n\nDon't worry about the flight back home.\
  \ There is a good chance you can lose it, which only means that there is more story\
  \ to tell about this trip before going back home and answering that dreaded question:\
  \ \"So, how was your travel?\""
