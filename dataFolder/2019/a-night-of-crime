Text: "She was in her wedding dress holding a bouquet; he was in his suit. They stood\
  \ out because they were a beautiful Caucasian couple. But also because it was almost\
  \ midnight and we were on the all-stop train to Seoul. \n\nI wanted to stare but\
  \ nobody else was looking. \n\n\u201CWow,\u201D Joey whispers. \n\n\u201CI know!\u201D\
  \ I whisper in agreement. \n\nIt was unnerving that nobody else was amused of what\
  \ me and my equally Pinoy boyfriend was seeing. Back home this would have been a\
  \ big deal and no minute would pass until a complete stranger asks them questions.\n\
  \nLater, we alight at the station only for me to discover that my T-money card was\
  \ gone. I was so occupied with the newlyweds that somewhere and sometime in the\
  \ journey, I dropped my main access to South Korean public transportation.\n\nJoey\
  \ was already on the other side of the turnstile having tapped his card. \n\n\u201C\
  I lost my card! It\u2019s not here.\u201D I whisper/yell at him. There weren\u2019\
  t any people around as I\u2019ve read that the subways closed short after midnight.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThen just go over,\u201D Joey says calmly. Back home he wouldn\u2019\
  t have to tell me. It would have been what I thought too. But this was not the Philippines.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThere are CCTVs!\u201D Dread washes over me at the thought of being\
  \ arrested on our first night in this foreign land. Arrest was probably an exaggeration.\
  \ Still, I didn\u2019t want to break rules. \u201CYou know what, I\u2019ll just\
  \ re-trace our steps. Maybe the card is still there.\u201D\n\nI ask Joey to wait\
  \ exactly where he was as I searched for the card. But I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere.\
  \ I started searching for a vending machine where I could get another T-money, but\
  \ there weren\u2019t any. Hopeless, I decided to head back. \n\n\u201CA drunk ajhussi\
  \ just went over!\u201D Joey exclaimed as I was approaching. \n\n\u201CReally?\u201D\
  \ I was still not willing to do it, but already considering. After all, the later\
  \ we got out meant our booked accommodation could be forfeited. \n\n\u201CYes! Besides,\
  \ you already paid for the fare when you tapped in at the airport station. So technically\u2026\
  \u201D He didn\u2019t have to finish for me to agree. \n\n\u201CQuick, I think I\
  \ hear someone approaching.\u201D I lift my luggage to his side and jump over as\
  \ quickly as I could. Then we briskly walk towards the exit, not looking back. \n\
  \nWe\u2019re not prepared for the biting cold that greets us as we surface. Both\
  \ born and raised in a tropical country, we only ever experienced wet and dry seasons.\
  \ \n\n\u201CCo-o-old.\u201D  Barely out of the station and we\u2019re already shivering.\
  \ Barely 10 minutes since that turnstile stunt and the punishment is already here.\
  \ I feel like crying. \n\nJoey hugs me and I cave into the familiar. It\u2019s not\
  \ enough warmth for the late November temperature, but my heart warms nonetheless.\
  \ It is during this time that I get to take in the surroundings. \n\n\u201CWhich\
  \ direction are we\u2014 \u201CI stop mid-sentence as smoke puffs out. Our eyes\
  \ widen. Joey purposely blows a puff of air and there indeed was a cloud right out\
  \ of his mouth. \n\nWe start laughing and blow some more. \u201CJust like in the\
  \ movies.\u201D Our laughter rings\u2014the strangers don\u2019t care. When we slightly\
  \ get over this, we start to head for our hotel. \n\nIt is past midnight; yet the\
  \ streets we pass still glow with colorful lights. There are three or more aquariums\
  \ along the route all with sea creatures we\u2019ve never seen before. An adult\
  \ shop announces itself with bright LED bulbs\u2014already visible from a block\
  \ away. This makes us giggle. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d ever see one back home.\n\
  \nWhen we are finally at our room, I am unable to sleep. I think of what we went\
  \ through that night. Am I a criminal, or simply melodramatic? \n\nThe next day\
  \ nobody comes looking for me. I feel relief, just as the first snow of that winter\
  \ season falls. \n\nI thought I knew what I\u2019ll be getting when I visited South\
  \ Korea, but I didn\u2019t expect to find a thrilling adventure would come with\
  \ it."
