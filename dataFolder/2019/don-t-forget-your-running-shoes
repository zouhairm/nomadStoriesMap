Text: "If I had to translate the definition of a traveler to a Hong Kong native, I\
  \ would use the Cantonese characters for \"runner.\" Running away from the noise\
  \ of \"here\" and running to the unknown possibilities of \"new\" and \"exciting.\"\
  \ That search dictated every flight I booked, every hostel I slept in, and every\
  \ country I moved to. Visiting Hong Kong from Shanghai for my Chinese New Year vacation\
  \ was no different. I, an African-American ESL teacher who had been running for\
  \ years, wanted answers. Would I always long for the unknown? Or was the spark finally\
  \ gone and I needed to settle for \"here?\"  I gave myself five days to decide.\n\
  \nIronically, Chinese New Year is the worst time to visit China in general. Majority\
  \ of the population was doing what I was doing: escaping. I can only imagine what\
  \ they were running towards. As for me, I ran into a maze. \n\nHong Kong felt like\
  \ a puzzle with its winding streets and constant nooks and crannies. When I looked\
  \ up, I couldn't see past the hundreds of skyscrapers that surrounded me no matter\
  \ where I was in the city. It felt like a kid stacked blocks one on top of the other,\
  \ not caring whether it was new or old. The shiny new Muji store didn't care that\
  \ it was across the street from a rusty apartment building. The line of (closed)\
  \ street food stands didn't sneer at the Michelin Star Thai restaurant at the end\
  \ of the block; they both stood side-by-side unapologetically.\n\nWalking through\
  \ those streets, I felt energetic for the first time in a long time. Not only that,\
  \ I didn't feel like a spectacle as one of the few darker-skinned people around,\
  \ probably the rarest of feats in my travel experience. I felt a pull I forgot about\
  \ when traveling: the hunger to explore. \n\nSo, every day I tied my hair up and\
  \ tried something new. I let myself be pulled into the city. I found the rhythm\
  \ in the curving streets and tiny shops, welcomed the quiet of the bookstores, and\
  \ clapped along to the traditional music ushering the new year as a band played\
  \ in front of a giant pink and red dog statue. \n\nHong Kong held my full attention.\n\
  \nYet, it was the sight of outdoor basketball courts that made me pause in awe.\
  \ It was a shot of familiarity. So was the taste of good pizza for the first time\
  \ in months, the conversation I had with a restaurant owner over lunch, the thrill\
  \ I got as my taxi driver zoomed across bridges at 3 am, the selfie I took with\
  \ locals in a cafe, and hearing two French kids reference The Lion King while watching\
  \ Black Panther for the first time. It was the certainty I felt when talking to\
  \ my mom over video chat. I gained clarity, a connection between me and this place\
  \ I ran to on a whim. I was ready to settle for \"here,\" the familiar and \"safe,\"\
  \ only to find out \"here\" can find me anywhere I go in the world. \n\nMy decision\
  \ is made. Unknown, here I come."
