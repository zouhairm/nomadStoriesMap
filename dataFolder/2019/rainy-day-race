Text: "The diffuse grayness intimates that the sky is not merely cloud-obscured but\
  \ has forgotten how to be blue. Rain spits downward from high above, speckling and\
  \ fogging my see-through umbrella. Noboru, my host here in Ito, Japan, strides ahead\
  \ as I struggle to keep up with him, my Los Angeles sneakers skidding on rain-soaked\
  \ concrete.\n   I have no idea where we\u2019re heading, but I swivel my head to\
  \ see everything - fountains jetting hot water, pagoda-style roofs with scrolled\
  \ eaves that periodically startle me with loud plops on my umbrella. \u201CThat\
  \ guesthouse is over 100 years old.\u201D Noboru indicates an imposing rectangle\
  \ to our left with square-screened windows and a green roof. \u201CWow!\u201D I\
  \ murmur inanely. We turn into a narrow street, its sidewalk an afterthought jutting\
  \ off an apartment block, and I trip along until we reach a small park by the Matsukawa\
  \ River.\n   I find my new friends clad in bright raincoats and brighter smiles.\
  \ Noboru wishes me well, and I turn to Megumi and Kumiko. \u201CIt\u2019s such a\
  \ good thing you\u2019re here today.\u201D Megumi leads me to a fence along the\
  \ river\u2019s edge. We have to squeeze a little to fit between locals and tourists.\
  \ I now have a clear view downstream where the river empties into the ocean - its\
  \ gaping mouth a mix of salt and fresh. Several yards up from the sea a sort of\
  \ scaffolding rises above the water\u2019s surface.\n\t\u201CThat\u2019s the finish\
  \ line,\u201D Megumi says.\n\t\u201CFor what?\u201D\n\t\u201CTarai-nori kyoso or\
  \ washtub boat race,\u201D Kumiko slows on the word washtub. \u201CIto hosts it\
  \ every first Sunday of July since 1955.\u201D\n   A loud splash-bang interrupts\
  \ our conversation and a duo of announcers begins to chatter excitedly over a loudspeaker.\
  \ I cannot understand a word of the enthusiastic commentary, but I can see upstream\
  \ to where men load large basins into the water from a dock that stretches between\
  \ the river\u2019s cobbled banks. Several more tubs lean against each other like\
  \ slanted dominoes.\n\t\u201CThe tubs were used for washing clothes, but now hotels\
  \ store them for racing,\u201D Megumi translates.\n\t\u201CHow do they pick the\
  \ racers?\u201D\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s a random drawing,\u201D Kumiko says. \u201CAnyone\
  \ can enter, but you must be lucky to be chosen.\u201D\n   We stand downstream from\
  \ a bridge that crosses a wide section of river. It is deep and fast-moving only\
  \ in a narrow channel on the far side. As we watch, four washtubs bob gently past,\
  \ each bearing a person in a white yukata and black obi. \u201CThose are Shinto\
  \ priests; they always go first to bless the river,\u201D Kumiko states. The priests\
  \ deftly maneuver the tubs through the narrow gap using rice paddles to propel themselves\
  \ along with the current. Their passage is graceful and quick, suggesting they run\
  \ this river every day.\n   Behind them come four more washtubs. These spin and\
  \ rock ominously. The tubs, linked by ropes into two pairs, orbit each other in\
  \ a dizzying dance. At the gap, one pair becomes stuck and has to be freed by a\
  \ man holding a long pole. The occupants of this second set of tubs are a Western\
  \ family - father, mother, and teenage daughters - dressed in sodden, flowery yukatas.\
  \ The parents seem cheerful, but the teens radiate misery and embarrassment as they\
  \ ineffectually wield their rice paddles.\n   The announcers narrate the dismal\
  \ progress with gasps and cheers, interspersed with matter-of-fact disquisition.\
  \ \u201COh!\u201D Megumi exclaims. \u201CThat is the mayor of Ito\u2019s sister\
  \ city. They come from Rieti, Italy. They host this same event but with wine barrels\
  \ instead.\u201D\n   I can\u2019t help laughing. The thought that two small towns\
  \ on opposite sides of the planet developed the same custom and then managed to\
  \ find each other is a small kind of magic. The shivering Italians make it out,\
  \ allowing the first group of contestants to enter the water. I spend the rest of\
  \ the morning enjoying the wild costumes of the racers and cheering them on past\
  \ the pitfalls of the course. Some of them capsize, but they all make it to the\
  \ end somehow. The announcers capture the drama and keep the crowds laughing. My\
  \ mind wanders - admiring a town that makes time for frivolity and contemplating\
  \ a trip to its far-flung sister."
