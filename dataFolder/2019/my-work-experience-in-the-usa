Text: "Hi, everyone! I'm Kristina and I want to tell you something about my visit\
  \ to such a great country like the USA. \nFirst of all, I came there by the international\
  \ program \"Work and travel\" for three or four months in 2012. I worked as a ride\
  \ operator in an amusement park (in New Jersey). It wasn't hard for me to join our\
  \ team. I knew English quite well at that time and wasn't afraid of strangers. Our\
  \ team consisted of Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Bulgarian people. I shared\
  \ a room with two girls, and there also was another one. We lived in a big house\
  \ near the ocean and had a common kitchen and bathroom. Seaside Heights, the city\
  \ on Jersey Beach, is very small that's why sometimes we didn't know what to do\
  \ on our day offs, so, we were going to the nearest town for shopping. I liked my\
  \ job, coz, usually, there were not many people, and crowds; only on holidays or\
  \ big weekends people could enjoy the rides, barbecue, and walking along the promenade.\
  \ After a month in the United States, I adapted to that life. During these three\
  \ months, I visited the US capital - Washington, and Niagara Falls. I was impressed\
  \ by these magical places. At the end of my job, I had exactly one week left before\
  \ the start of my studies in Minsk. I went to stay with my American aunt in New\
  \ York. I settled in their house on Staten Island. I managed to visit five different\
  \ areas of the Big Apple. I was very impressed because New York was one of my childhood\
  \ dreams. I do not remember much from that trip, but I promise myself that I will\
  \ definitely return to my beloved city - New York."
