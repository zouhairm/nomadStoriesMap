Text: "I cannot quite grasp the magical poetry that some people find in traveling.\n\
  \nWhich might seem like the recognition of a categorical failure for a true modern\
  \ world gypsy, of\nbirth and experience, condemned by blood to a proverbial wanderlust\
  \ that actually never was. But, of\nall possible kinds of failure, this might be\
  \ the most enlightening one.\n\nFor someone to set sail, a lighthouse must be built\
  \ and tended. Not always by choice, I'd say,\nsince the insincere world we inhabit\
  \ demands more than just our legs for walking, more than the lands\nit provides\
  \ for journeying. Be it for the lack of courage or money, time or means; from the\
  \ materialistic\nproblematic to the more unsubstantial, truly harrowing of reasons\
  \ to create unwanted roots, for as much\nas they forbid a step out, they also allow\
  \ a walk in.\n\nIt so happens that even behind the thin veil of personal morals,\
  \ societal ethics or any\nphilosophical contradiction in between and, most of the\
  \ times, also beyond, sometimes hidden deeply\neven from one's own mind's eye, each\
  \ individual is fighting their best fight. For that alone, everyone\nthat crosses\
  \ your path - may it be on a daily walk for groceries or on the tiresome routine\
  \ that true love\nalone makes bearable - deserves their commendable reward. On that\
  \ regard, tending to that lighthouse\nis an ultimatum: the often-taken-for-granted\
  \ opportunity that each singular person has to turn\nthemselves inside out and shine\
  \ on the world their own world unknown. The often-taken-for-granted\nopportunity\
  \ that both comfort and indisputable inquietude will drive oneself towards. The\
  \ often-takenfor-\ngranted opportunity that both those who travel and those who\
  \ don't have.\n\nThe choice to stay.\n\nAnd there is beauty in that; in the strange\
  \ recognition of the simplicity and how easy it is for\nany and everyone to do that\
  \ which you believe you do best. It's paradoxically humbling and enriching\nin the\
  \ sense that the means matter so little and the platform is nothing more than that.\
  \ Those who take\non the world would be commonplace if there wasn't those who stayed\
  \ and signaled. Enter the\nlighthouse keeper: ensuring that the rays turn bright\
  \ to every side, all over and all around; on everyone.\nInside and out. Both at\
  \ sea and on firm land. Casting the before unseen shine of those before unseen\n\
  riches; unexpected discovery. The joys of a curated life, expressed virtually and\
  \ cherished in its\nsuperficiality, traveled mostly through the outside of one's\
  \ existence. The truth hidden behind forced\nsmiles and carefully sunbathed poses,\
  \ a lot less cherished but infinitely more valuable. Stories that can\nonly be told\
  \ over cigarettes and booze and those on how such things stopped being a part of\
  \ someone's\nlife. Every single form of hedonism, from those forbidden, arrested\
  \ in the deepest slumber, to those\nblatantly and proudly set free. Vice; recovery.\
  \ Life, and all the untold efforts demanded to keep living.\nDeath, and the mourning\
  \ thereof, or any form of growth consequential to one's own existence. Journeys\n\
  one and all, serendipitous travels tirelessly cruised by every single conscience\
  \ that dared to be. And that\nis where friends and lovers and kin turn into the\
  \ most magical destinations anyone could go on, and\nthose the lighthouse keepers\
  \ know all too well, waiting ashore for their return every single time.\n\nAs for\
  \ the Brazilian gypsy, non-patriotic yet coercively homelanded, if his morning routine\n\
  should be the same as that of everyone else in his reality \u2013 simply put, as\
  \ they say: to wake up, drink a\ncoffee, smoke a cigarette, witness a tragedy and\
  \ go to work \u2013 then may that be his journey in and of\nitself, and would the\
  \ travels trailed within, and shone upon his brothers and sisters alike, sate the\n\
  unborn wanderlust of the lighthouse keeper."
