Text: "Here I am. In Malaysia .\n\nThe sunshine was perfect.I was walking around with\
  \ my family and laughing it felt like a great day and suddenly everything just stopped.\n\
  \nI am standing in front of my dream college called Le Cordon Bleu. I've been dreaming\
  \ about this since i was a little girl but things happened i didn't really know\
  \ why it just stopped. Being here made me realize how passionate i was . The smell\
  \ of the front office made me smile. \n\nIt wasn't stop there. I got a tour from\
  \ one kitchen to another . It was a really big opportunity for me . \n\nFooda are\
  \ everything for me and especially desserts . The sweetness,The bitterness of the\
  \ chocolate and The thousand layers of flavour makes me wanna dance. I remembered\
  \ at that time i made a promise with myself as soon as i got home i will be working\
  \ with myself and i will be studying here someday . \n\nThis journey really opened\
  \ my mind and makes me realize there is always a better way and you gotta think\
  \ outside the box. It was not just about the college but it was about who you are\
  \ and who you think you're gonna be. Don't let other people makes you uncomfortable\
  \ about yourself . This trip really  changed my life . As my childhood heroes,Mary\
  \ Poppins says \"everything is possible even the impossibe\". You gotta believe\
  \ in yourself and the best is yet to come."
