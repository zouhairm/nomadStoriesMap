Text: "I had a week to enjoy my vacation. Although I already knew Fortaleza, but I\
  \ did not know Jericoacoara. Until then I only knew it through social media. And\
  \ I was very happy to find out everything about Jericoacoara. As soon as I arrived\
  \ I did a buggy ride known as the East Ride. There we stop by the tree of laziness\
  \ many tourists stop to take pictures and then we go to paria of the pre\xE1. With\
  \ restaurants and shops of beautiful crafts. And we go to the blue lagoon where\
  \ we have lunch. On the way back we return through the dunes of the national park\
  \ to see the sun.\nAt night the lighting is only of restaurants and inns, there\
  \ is no crime, no traffic noise. It's a moonlight night. The next day I made a walk\
  \ to the pierced stone stepping on the sand in the morning is sensational. The only\
  \ noise was the sea. In return to the inn to find the bugueiro and do the West tour,\
  \ full of adventure. Dry Mangrove, giant dunes despite the scorching sun is fantastic.\
  \ We stopped at the beach of tata juba and of course I jumped on the water Tobo\
  \ which gives a cold in the belly and then went to lagoinha lay me in a hammock\
  \ and wait for my lunch. There the menu is live in 10 minutes lunch gets ready what\
  \ a treat no?"
