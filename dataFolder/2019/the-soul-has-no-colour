Text: "\"Next Station: Davisville, Davisville Station\" says the pre-recorded, famous\
  \ and elegant voice of the Toronto Transit Commission, known as the TTC. \n\nFour\
  \ years ago I started this journey, caught by the charm of multiculturalism and\
  \ multilingualism that exists in Toronto. \u201COh Canada!\u201D such a welcoming\
  \ country \u201CEh?\u201D.\n\nI remembered the reason why I was on that subway train.\
  \ Earlier that week I received a call. \"We would like to know if you would be available\
  \ as a volunteer on Saturday for a volunteer program event on children refugee protection.\"\
  \ The opportunity as a traveler that started a series of events that completely\
  \ changed my life.\n\nThat Saturday, I woke up excited for the day I was about to\
  \ embark on. I put my headphones in and searched google maps, pleasantly surprised\
  \ the event was taking place only one stop from mine. I put on all my winter attire\
  \ and accessories which at that point had become tedious. \n\nMy intuition told\
  \ me this day was unusual.  \n\nI arrived at the subway station with frozen hands\
  \ in the middle of chaos between rush hour and TTC delays. I looked around me and\
  \ wondered what each person\u2019s story was as they moved with eagerness to reach\
  \ their destinations. They looked frustrated and depressed after being exposed to\
  \ the icy north wind, impossible to ignore even when you receive the reflection\
  \ of the sun that comes from extravagant and enormous skyscrapers that harbor the\
  \ city.\n\nIn all of my travels, taking the subway has taught me the inner workings\
  \ of a city\u2019s culture. Being static in a machine moving at 28 kilometers per\
  \ hour while carrying approximately 533.2 million passengers per year all from different\
  \ countries and backgrounds. \n\nDuring that commute I noticed a lady, who gently\
  \ smiled at me. \n\nI was standing in front of the metallic doors of the train,\
  \ staring at my reflection, getting ready to arrive at the station. Suddenly, I\
  \ felt that someone had a strong grip on my wrist. As I turned around without a\
  \ second to blink, that\u2019s when I felt it. \n\nAll around the world we hear\
  \ of terrible stories with the root of the problem being cruel and unfiltered violence,\
  \ Toronto is no exception. However, it has taught me that despite the existence\
  \ of conflict we can still live amongst each other. There was no flip of a switch\
  \ that my brain could turn on to explain what was happening. I was being hurt by\
  \ humanity, in the city that kindly welcomed me.\n\n\u201CYou will be fine, can\
  \ you hear me?\u201D said the lady that smiled at me minutes before. All I remembered\
  \ was her speeding to the emergency button. I asked her to hold my hand.\n\nWhile\
  \ waiting and listening to the emergency alarm, I could not stop wondering why I\
  \ was chosen to be hurt. As a woman, was it my gender? As an afro Latina, was it\
  \ the color of my skin? Or my curly kinky hair? Or was it the fact that I was a\
  \ foreigner and not deserving to be in his country?  I was shaking from the lost\
  \ blood that was coming from my lip, but mostly shaking from fear. I couldn\u2019\
  t help but appreciate the lady that was right beside me, a complete stranger who\
  \ was smiling down at me trying to explain the details of what was happening around\
  \ me. All I could hear was her saying with kindness \u201Cyou are a beautiful, young,\
  \ strong and a worthy lady\u201D. \n\nThe hospital was never on my \u201CTop 10\
  \ Things To See in Toronto\u201D list but there I was, getting stitches. Alone,\
  \ with no family or close friends, in a city where independence and individualism\
  \ predominates. Where everyone hurrying can be appreciated as an art or a sport,\
  \ among the skyscrapers and concrete landscape that only remind us of how small\
  \ we are in such a huge world. The physical pain was no comparison to the mental\
  \ anguish. The scar on my lip will be always a reminder of the unnecessary violence\
  \ and greed that invades humanity. \n\n\"Arriving at Davisville\u2026 Davisville\
  \ Station\u2026 doors will open on the right\" finally says the pre-recorded voice."
