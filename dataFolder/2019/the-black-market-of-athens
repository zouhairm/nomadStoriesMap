Text: "A man brushes past me on the street.\n\nHe mutters something that I don\u2019\
  t quite catch, but understand from experience.\n\n\u201CEpta.\u201D Seven.\n\nHe\u2019\
  s selling and I, apparently, have the look of a buyer.\n\nI touch my eyes, imagining\
  \ them red, perhaps bloodshot from exhaustion, jet lag.\n\nIt\u2019s coffee I want,\
  \ not weed.\n\nI'm on my way to meet a friend for lunch. The same friend who first\
  \ introduced me to these shady, back streets of Athens.\n\n\u201CThey call this\
  \ the black market,\u201D he once told me. \u201CThey\u201D meaning the Greeks.\
  \ \u201CBlack,\u201D he explained, because that was where people like him lived\
  \ and worked and bought and sold. The Bengalis, Pakistanis, and others. It wasn't\
  \ until he told me he had bought his Nike\u2019s there for just thirty Euros that\
  \ I realized it was more of a \u201Cblack market\u201D in the traditional sense.\n\
  \nHe\u2019s a man of many names and many passports, but let's just call him A. He\u2019\
  s been my guide through this strange world, hidden beneath a sea of Mediterranean\
  \ tourism. I\u2019ve seen men working in back alleys with the organization and diligence\
  \ of a factory to empty, sort, and redistribute the city\u2019s garbage. I\u2019\
  ve learned the difference between Greek, Pakistani, and Arabian kebabs. \n\nIt was\
  \ here that I tried my first jalmuri. Jalmuri is the best thing you will ever taste:\
  \ chickpeas, onion, puffed rice, cucumber, tomatoes, and spices, fresh and crunchy.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019ve seen the efficiency of their loyalty, as A has received and sent\
  \ messages warning his friends of police rounds up and brutality.\n\nShirts and\
  \ shoes, jalmuri and Arabian kebabs, and a pointed lack of women: this is the so\
  \ called black market of Athens that I have come to love.\nBut there is another\
  \ type of \u201Cblack market\u201D alive in Athens, driven by the demand for cheap\
  \ labor and low prices for tourists. Fed by the need for work and remittance. \n\
  \nA was only sixteen when his parents paid human traffickers to fly him to Iran\
  \ on a forged visa. With no work in Iran, he was loaded into a truck with fifty\
  \ other men, women, and children. He has no idea how long the drive lasted or how\
  \ he survived the piss, shit and vomit, taking turns standing by the door for fresh\
  \ air. When the doors were finally opened, they tumbled forth into the dust and\
  \ the heat. His legs buckled beneath him.\n\n\u201CWalk,\u201D a man ordered, gesturing\
  \ with his gun. \u201CIf you try to turn back, you will be shot. If you fall behind,\
  \ you will die. If you try to alert the police, you will be shot.\u201D\n\nThey\
  \ had no choice. They began to walk.\n\nAs we sit in the restaurant, a small room\
  \ in the back alleys of Omonia, decorated with bright paintings of dancing women,\
  \ A tells the latest news about our mutual acquaintance, \u201CUncle\u201D. \n\n\
  Uncle is from the same town in Bangladesh as A and is slightly older. He hopes to\
  \ return soon to find a wife, but to do that you need money, and Uncle is currently\
  \ unemployed. Previously, he spent a year working in a restaurant for just two euros\
  \ an hour.\n\n\u201CHe is bad guy,\u201D A laughs. \u201CSo he has no job now.\u201D\
  \n\nHis English is quick, but has a strange, slightly \u201Coff\u201D quality that\
  \ I find charming. It\u2019s hard to imagine that he could barely introduce himself\
  \ just two years before. Bangla, Hindi, Urdu, Greek, and now English. He\u2019s\
  \ a true polyglot: one born of necessity.\n\n\u201CHe was fired?\u201D I say. \u201C\
  Why?\u201D\n\nHe shrugs, \u201CHe\u2019s too much lazy. He\u2019s no like for working.\u201D\
  \n\nHe says this in a tone that suggests his sympathies lie with the restaurant.\
  \ Uncle should have worked harder for his two euros.\n\nA speaks from experience.\
  \ From digging for food and salvageable, sellable goods in the garbage bins of Athens,\
  \ to breaking his back on an island farm, to a cushy \u20AC6 an hour hospital job,\
  \ he has worked for every scrap that has been thrown, reluctantly, across his path.\
  \ He knows he must fight for everything, because that is precisely what he has lost."
