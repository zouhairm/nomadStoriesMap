Text: "All black was not my smartest choice.\n\nI was mulling over this error whilst\
  \ I sat waiting crossed legged in the powdery sand of Great Keppel Island in Northern\
  \ Queensland.\n\nOur scheduled course had pivoted due to flooding further north,\
  \ and as a result - the tour I was leading was ferried out to an island I'd never\
  \ heard of.\n\nCotton pants were usually a safe bet, but the January sun was pounding\
  \ out her unwavering best and the Celsius was sitting around 38 mid-morning. It\
  \ was taking considerable willpower to maintain the semi-circle in which we sat,\
  \ and not fling myself into the embrace of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSoon I would be\
  \ able to don the ever attractive alien ware that is a snorkel mask but before I\
  \ could loll about in the waves, we were attending a Welcome to Country.\n\nThe\
  \ Welcome to Country was a cultural formality I had grown accustomed to in various\
  \ locations around the country, although this was my first at Great Keppel. The\
  \ controversiality of our nation's birthday had been only days before and was a\
  \ charged political dance my international guests had uneasily witnessed.\n\n\"\
  Australia Day\" or \"Invasion Day\" - depending on personal beliefs - had been unsettling.\
  \ My travellers wanted to celebrate the wondrous land down under with locals, but\
  \ the feeling on the streets was far too charged to parade Australian flags or paraphernalia\
  \ when a lot of the community were protesting a date change. The current date; the\
  \ 26th of January, is the day the First Fleet arrived and European settlement in\
  \ Australia began. It also marks the invasion of over 250 indigenous cultures that\
  \ existed in Australia at the time and the beginning of a very dark period in my\
  \ beloved homeland. I was hoping the Welcome to Country might make my passengers\
  \ feel more at ease about Aboriginal culture in Australia.\n\nThe Woppaburra nation\
  \ belong to the Keppel Islands, and before us stood a man of their community.\n\n\
  I'm sure my travellers had body paint and boomerangs in mind, but the man before\
  \ them was in double pluggers (a type of flip flop so wide they could substitute\
  \ water skis), board shorts and was styling a rat's tail that wouldn't have been\
  \ out of place in an eighties music video.\_\n\nHe opened his arms wide and with\
  \ a giant smile, introduced himself.\n\n\"Welcome to Woppaburra Country. My name\
  \ is Nerark and today, I want to welcome you to Woppaburra land so that you are\
  \ always welcome here and can be guided by the spirits and the Woppaburra people.\"\
  \n\nNerark knelt to the ground, where a bundle of fresh Eucalyptus leaves lay wrapped\
  \ into a bouquet. He folded himself over the bunch, laughing lightly as the flame\
  \ on his cigarette lighter taunted him as it bent in the wind.\n\nEventually the\
  \ leaves caught alight and as thick waves of smoke rolled across the sand, Nerark\
  \ begun to walk around the outside of the circle, hunched murmuring his native language\
  \ into the bouquet as he went.\n\nThere are many things that make me feel at home;\
  \ the karate chop aimed at a fly too close to a nostril; the smell of inch thick\
  \ sunscreen smeared across shoulders; the perfect coupling of Vegemite toast and\
  \ a cup of tea in the morning. But there is nothing quite like an Aboriginal dialect\
  \ that sends me rushing directly up the vein to the heart of our country.\n\nNerark's\
  \ words are the seeds of our history, culture and tradition. They belong like the\
  \ kookaburra in the tree's and the sear of the sun. They are the smell of the seaweed\
  \ and the swoop of a magpie.\_I had no idea what he was saying, but it embodied\
  \ home.\n\nAfter the controversy of the 26th, I needed to hear his language because\
  \ it made me proud. Proud to share and belong to a country with such diversity,\
  \ beauty and opportunity. Proud to share this land and it's people.\n\nProud to\
  \ be Australian.\n\nAs Nerark began to speak of Woppaburra way of life, I relaxed\
  \ back into the sand and tipped my head to that quintessential Aussie sun and smiled.\n\
  \nIt was good to be welcomed home again."
