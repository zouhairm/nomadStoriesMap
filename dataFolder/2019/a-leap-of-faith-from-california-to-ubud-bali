Text: "Riding a scooter on a road through the rice fields, I feel as if I\u2019m in\
  \ a video game.  Alert as cars, bikes, chickens, dogs move in front of me, cut in\
  \ from the side of me.  My senses are on overdrive as I navigate my way into Ubud\
  \ central.  Meditation and spiritual mecca for those wanting healing, those who\
  \ are: healers, nomads, escape artists.  Land of Hindu ceremonies, incense, daily\
  \ blessings.  Swaying palm trees, rice fields, beauty.  \n\nI came to Bali on my\
  \ quest as a nomad.  At 55 years of age, I had turned in my Western lifestyle. \
  \ I had quit my job, sold my home, given away my belongings and left Los Angeles\
  \ for a simpler life.  Bali embraced me as a mother embraces a child, with warmth\
  \ and love and nurturing.  The locals spoke to me in a peaceful way, with warmth\
  \ and love and connection to the land and the sky.  A communication style that comes\
  \ across in their gentle smiles, soft glances and peaceful demeanor.\n\nTwo years\
  \ later, I\u2019m traveling to other lands, but basing myself in Ubud.  It is a\
  \ place of contrasts.  The Balinese conduct ceremony twice a day.  Blessing their\
  \ homes and temples.  Every house has a temple and every village as well.  Bright\
  \ yellow, pink, blue sarongs around the women\u2019s waists, with their white lace\
  \ shirts and sashes, so beautiful as they wave their hands and lay offerings of\
  \ flowers, rice and incense around their properties and temples. \n\nAmidst the\
  \ ceremony, the Western world creeps in.  Trash lays strewn about.  Dogs who are\
  \ in charge of protecting homes and villages also run about now, sometimes hit by\
  \ cars and with disease.  Westerners try to help with the trash situation, the rescuing\
  \ of the dogs.  But is it not the West that came in and created the overpopulation,\
  \ the need of Western consumption.  Did the Balinese not just throw banana leaves\
  \ on the ground, before there was plastic?  Did the rabies culling not come from\
  \ rabies, which Westerners brought to the Island?\n \nI drive amongst the chaos\
  \ of a village that has blossomed under the book and movie \u2018Eat, Pray, Love\u2019\
  .  I visited some 18 years ago, when Ubud was just a dot on the map.  Monkey forest\
  \ was a place where you went to visit the monkeys and there were just a few shops\
  \ in the small village than.  Today hundreds of Airbnb\u2019s and hotels line the\
  \ streets as do shops and bars.  Tourists clog the streets and go to one of the\
  \ many Western style yoga studios in town.  Healers are a dime a dozen and yes,\
  \ I am one also.  I heal as I heal.\n\nThere is a gentleness and peace in the land\
  \ that has sucked me in.  Like Quan Yin on the mountain, I feel the energy pull\
  \ me in, quiet my mind.  All light and darkness comes to light for me here in this\
  \ spiritual place.  I sit, I meditate, I feel. I am.  \n\nLike many of the expats,\
  \ I have taken to helping in the form of rescuing dogs; two of which, Angel and\
  \ Star, are with me now.  Angel has taken to being walked on a leash, so as not\
  \ to eat the neighbor\u2019s chickens and be taken herself.  Am I helping?  Or am\
  \ I stopping a natural evolution of things?  Interesting question.  \n\nThe dogs\
  \ keep me grounded as does my scooter.  At 57 I\u2019m staying young and in the\
  \ moment in many ways.  But whenever I get on my scooter to navigate the road it\
  \ reminds me about life.  I can go within and be with myself.  But things will come\
  \ to me from the outside world.  They may jump out surprisingly without warning.\
  \  I may see them coming.  They may pass me or ride alongside me.  There is nothing\
  \ more beautiful than exploring new places and things.  For they open one to new\
  \ possibilities and also to the fact that life is always changing.  How will you\
  \ react to that change?\n\nFor me, for now, I give thanks to Ubud and all it is\
  \ teaching me.  I am grateful to have taken that leap into the unknown."
