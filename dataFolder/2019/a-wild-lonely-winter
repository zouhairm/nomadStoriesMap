Text: "I\u2019ve never lived in the mountains and I thought it would take longer to\
  \ get used to the cold. You live by the rising and setting of the sun, relishing\
  \ its presence, seeking warmth at night by building fires and in the warm embrace\
  \ of friendship. I wake up in my van, sometimes to find frost on the windows, and\
  \ have finally learned the art of lingering. I doze in the comfort of blankets,\
  \ put on a pot of water for tea and wait for the sun to rouse me. With the back\
  \ of the van open the air feels fresh, but that\u2019s just an excuse to stay huddled\
  \ beneath the covers. \n\nWaking up slowly is different and I like it. I really\
  \ feel into the day before it begins. I take time to greet the clouds, read the\
  \ surface of the lake, wonder at the songs of birds. I take a moment to see how\
  \ I\u2019m feeling, choosing to let the day seize me for once. I travelled to Australia\
  \ for this very reason\u2026 to live in a van. Or more simply, to live. \n\nThere\u2019\
  s a quote by Henry David Thoreau that I carry somewhere more secret than my heart.\
  \ His words reside in the deep part of my soul, a place I\u2019m discovering is\
  \ a wellspring of more life than I imagined I could hold. I hear them when the space\
  \ between me and the world is so close I can feel its breath on my cheek. As I lean\
  \ in for that kiss, my heart beat quickens and cracks wide open. \n\n\u201CI went\
  \ to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential\
  \ facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when\
  \ I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\u201D\n\nIt\u2019s taken me years\
  \ of reflection to understand these words, to digest and absorb them. I used to\
  \ tread so delicately around life to the point where I was too respectful to look\
  \ it in the eye. My reverence separated us, I refused to howl into the night sky\
  \ lest I create a disturbance. But the closer I drew, the more I intuited that life\
  \ wants to be held. It longs to be tasted, touched and played with. It\u2019s full\
  \ of such flavour, colour, texture, it flaunts itself before our senses to be experienced\
  \ and beheld. Why would we be here if not to love deeply and live wildly?\n\nJindabyne\
  \ invited me to return to the wild. I couldn\u2019t resist the vast landscape and\
  \ the promise of a lonely winter. Difficult choices were made to get here but there\u2019\
  s a feeling, a knowing, an invitation to trust and just be for a while. \n\nI can\u2019\
  t help but be present here. There\u2019s a certain magic in the air, a quality that\
  \ provokes stillness, a firm encouragement to be captivated by serenity, immersed\
  \ in silence, deep in conversation with life itself. \n\nThere\u2019s so much space.\
  \ It\u2019s overwhelming and yet, now that I\u2019ve felt it, I will not retreat.\
  \ I want to explore the wilderness. I want to feel the cold. I have discovered that\
  \ by being present with my shadows, they no longer protest when I get present with\
  \ the rest that life has to offer. \n\nI did not expect the winter to be so rich\
  \ with life. Abundant. The deciduous trees encourage me to take the time to heal.\
  \ The snowy mountains promise strength and solidity. The lake captures the ebb and\
  \ flow of life and death. I listen to trees, sing with birds and watch shooting\
  \ stars in the night sky. \n\nIf there\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t feel, it\u2019\
  s fear. My wild nature prevails here, because I sense my predators a mile away,\
  \ I\u2019m tracking the path I want to follow, and I recognise a friend when I find\
  \ one. \n\nAnd I have become my greatest friend, my most trusted ally \nIf that\
  \ voice inside my heart says go, then I\u2019ll spread my wings and fly \nBut if\
  \ I hear it whisper, as I do today\nThen I\u2019ll find shelter, build a fire and\
  \ learn, at last, to stay."
