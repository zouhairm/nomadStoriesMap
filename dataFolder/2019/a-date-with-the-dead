Text: "It was a cold, wintery morning, plagued with blowing winds and chilly air,\
  \ just as Nonna had described it.  With the same ferocity and persistence as the\
  \ chilly Bora winds, the culture around every corner was ever-changing and fresh,\
  \ the product of a city built on Austro-Hungarian foundations, destroyed by war\
  \ and rebuilt by Italian hands.  This was a place so unique that no singular culture\
  \ could define it and no singular country could tie it down.  However, bringing\
  \ this motion to a halt, set in stone before me, was the remains of Jole Kuk; or\
  \ at least this is how I imagined it.\n\nMore accurately, I sit in the warm confines\
  \ of my Nonna\u2019s humble, Australian home, eagerly taking mental notes of each\
  \ story she tells me of the place where she grew up.  She repeats a story I have\
  \ heard at least one hundred times before, yet I hang on to every word as if it\u2019\
  s her last.  The story is of Trieste.\n\nTrieste is a city and seaport, bordering\
  \ Slovenia in the North of Italy.  This was the place where she grew up, right in\
  \ the middle of World War II, with a father hated by Italy for writing about Mussolini\
  \ and a selfless, devoted mother that passed away at 21.  \n\nWhen her mother passed\
  \ away my Nonna was only five years old, leaving her to fend for herself and her\
  \ two younger sisters while her father took part in the war.  She grew up in the\
  \ busy city centre of Trieste in an orphanage, where she spent her days in class\
  \ and her nights in bunkers hiding from bombs.\n\nOne of the most shocking stories\
  \ she tells is of the year she spent in hospital after her mother passed away. \
  \ The doctors tried to hide her from the truth and told her that her mother was\
  \ fine, however my Nonna knew better.  She speaks of the heartbreak of war; spending\
  \ sleepless nights in underground bunkers and then finding broken windows, dead\
  \ bodies and fallen buildings the next morning.\n\nJust like every other time she\
  \ tells me her stories, she decorates the horror-like scenes with colourful descriptions\
  \ of the beauty of Trieste.  It will start with a story about the beautiful Miramare\
  \ castle, meander through to a description of the culture laden dialect, stopping\
  \ by songs and poems she learnt along the way and then finishing with memories of\
  \ good food, good people and good times in the worst of times.\n\nAs her stories\
  \ continue, the smells of meaty, saucy, homemade gnocchi will fill the kitchen,\
  \ an ode to her own Dad\u2019s cooking, which she always raves about.  Then just\
  \ as I tuck into my generous helping of gnocchi, she\u2019ll remind me of her mother\
  \ who always gave up her food so that her children could eat.  While I\u2019m not\
  \ sure I believe the exaggerated, \u201Cshe would go weeks without food\u201D, the\
  \ sentiment is clear, my Nonna\u2019s mother was selfless and caring.  \n\nThen\
  \ the story will find yet another path as she turns to visual aids to guide her\
  \ storytelling.  This time it isn\u2019t about the war but about her friends and\
  \ her city.  She will bring out postcards from her childhood friends which she still\
  \ writes to today that contain long, elaborate reflections and memories of Trieste\
  \ then and Trieste now.\n\nThen as we say our goodbyes and I retreat back to my\
  \ own home, I think about Jole Kuk, my Nonna\u2019s mother.  Her tombstone acts\
  \ as the last remaining pillar of my Nonna\u2019s story in Trieste.  I dream of\
  \ the long plane trip and the cab to the hotel room, the walk to the cemetery with\
  \ Austrian strudel in one hand and Italian coffee in the other.  I imagine mapping\
  \ out the coordinates to her grave site as written by my Nonna on a small piece\
  \ of paper, marked, \u2018important\u2019.   Then I imagine that moment where all\
  \ of the stories align.  In a place where there is constant change and motion, her\
  \ story stands still."
