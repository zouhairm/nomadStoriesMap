Text: "One of the most alien concepts to me as an American has been bartering. The\
  \ only form of bartering that was familiar to me was in video games for swords and\
  \ shields, or trading lunchtime snacks with classmates. Had I ever tried to negotiate\
  \ at a store in my native Chicago, the only thing that would be brought down would\
  \ have been my expectations back down to Earth. As a sophomore in High School, I\
  \ had the honor of participating in a gemellaggio, or better known in English, a\
  \ foreign exchange trip. Along with a group of a dozen classmates, for a week I\
  \ hosted two students from Bari, right in the center of the heel that makes up Italy's\
  \ famous boot shape.\n\nFast forward to spring break, and the mega bus full of American\
  \ students and their teacher chaperones were unleashed upon the ancient town of\
  \ Assisi and its beautiful Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi. Even as my group\
  \ was being brought up to speed by our trip leader, Colin, about the customs of\
  \ Italian shopping, I remained doubtful that anyone would give an American the privilege\
  \ of paying less money. My doubt then multiplied when I remembered that the majority\
  \ of my classmates' Italian skills were limited to the menus of Italian restaurants\
  \ and whatever jumbled phrases stuck around in their head after asking somebody\
  \ that spoke the language.  Of course, I am fluent in Italian so I assured myself\
  \ that shopkeepers would just confuse me as a fellow Italian and not scam me. Nonetheless,\
  \ I just shoved that advice from our resident human-volume-of-the-Encyclopedia-Britannica\
  \ to the back of my mind and decided to keep to the status quo of ignorant American\
  \ consumerism and followed the rest of the group into the Basilica.\n\nWhile the\
  \ interior of the Basilica was as wonderfully decorated by great artists like Cimabue\
  \ as I had expected, to me, the part that defined the visit there was stepping outside\
  \ to the courtyard. Emerging from the perfumed incense that suffocated the gift\
  \ shop, the fresh air cut into my lungs and I just gave all of my attention to the\
  \ luscious hills that ran all the way into a valley that culminated into the town\
  \ square's fountain, midway between our bus and the Basilica. With some friends,\
  \ I snuck over to a hole-in-the-wall bakery at the foot of the valley with a precious\
  \ little nonna behind the counter watching her afternoon soap opera. \"Salve Ragazzi!\"\
  \ she exclaimed while we showed her our pearly whites and returned the pleasantries.\
  \ A couple of my classmates spoke to the lady, excited to actually practice their\
  \ Italian in real life, while the rest looked around the bakery. Perusing the dishes\
  \ stacked with sweets drizzled in chocolate or sprinkled with a delicate snowfall\
  \ of confectioner's sugar, I ultimately settled on two cannoli, one with chocolate\
  \ cream and one with the traditional ricotta, and a small box of candies. \n\n\"\
  10 euro, per favore,\" the nonna asks of me when I got to her counter. I took out\
  \ my wallet and immediately felt the regret of not using the ATM at the hostel bloom\
  \ within me. I only had seven euro in cash on me. I start to explain myself and\
  \ choose the cannoli over the box of candy before I get cut off by the nonna. She\
  \ lets me take the box for half the price and the gratefulness just starts spilling\
  \ out of my mouth. You would have thought I was apologizing to the Prime Minister\
  \ with the formality of my speech while the old lady just smiled. \n\nOne of the\
  \ chaperones calls my phone right as our group is finishing up in the bakery. He\
  \ tells us the rest of the group is back on the bus at the front of the Basilica\
  \ and we have five minutes to get back there. The confusion we instilled into the\
  \ locals as we laughed and hollered and ran down what felt like the steepest cobblestone\
  \ roads in Italy just to end up back on the bus with some sweets and one important\
  \ lesson: If you remember to barter, you can forget what breathlessness feels like\
  \ for a little while longer."
