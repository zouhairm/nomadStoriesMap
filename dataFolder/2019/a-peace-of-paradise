Text: "Everything starts when my friend Ramilie asked me if I wanted to travel with\
  \ her family to celebrate her birthday and I accepted. She decided to visit Cabo\
  \ Frio's city and planned a small boat trip for is in Arraial do Cabo. \nI already\
  \ visit Cabo Frio but not like the last time because we went there by car and we\
  \ used airbnb to pick up a place to spend our time while we have some fun there.\
  \ We met a kind and gentle couple that rented us a clean and beautiful house.\n\
  On the first day, we decided to visit Pero's beach but we chose a pretty wrong road\
  \ to get there and we stoped on a part of the beach that was empty. I confess that\
  \ confesse that because we could have experienced all sensations only for us but\
  \ no one thought it was a good Idea. \nThe boat trip was the most incredible experienced\
  \ I ever had because we could met people of other states and have fun with them.\
  \ We visit two beaches there and appreciate the beautiful view - water was totally\
  \ blue and the sand was white in one of them.  After lunch that day, we took a trail\
  \ to get to Forno's Beach and on the top of the mountain we had an amazing view\
  \ of the skyline where the sea encounters with the sky. \nOn the last day of our\
  \ trip, we visited Japanese Island and It was a scary and funny situation for us\
  \ because to get there we had to cross part of the sea at low tide. We carried bags\
  \ on the shoulders not to get wet. I remember that the water was pretty cold and\
  \ we could see some fish swimming near our feet. \nThat travel made me enjoy life\
  \ with one of my best friends and I realized that we should do this kind of thing\
  \ again because it was wonderful. We spent a really great time together in some\
  \ places that we loved to met and I am sure we will propably do it soon and visit\
  \ another city."
