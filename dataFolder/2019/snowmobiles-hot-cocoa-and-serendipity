Text: "If there were ever a time something terrible could happen, this would be it.\
  \ It was dark. Painfully dark. The kind of dark that allows nothing through, save\
  \ for the stars of a moonless night. I was in the mountainous depths of the Canadian\
  \ wilderness, blowing past evergreens at 50km an hour, without even a helmet to\
  \ prevent against ill-fate. Precariously straddling the back of a stranger\u2019\
  s snowmobile, my life clung around his waist. Yet, I hesitated in holding him too\
  \ tight, for I feared the insinuation of any grim ideas. Had he been 30 years younger,\
  \ I would have reveled in this moment, but that night, different thoughts crossed\
  \ my troubled mind. \n\nHurrying down a rhythm of moguls, I saw nothing but his\
  \ hunched body in front of me. My only salvation was the reflective mile markers\
  \ nailed to passing trees. Eight\u2026Seven\u2026Six. He\u2019d ask me if I was\
  \ okay. \u201CYes, I\u2019m fine,\u201D I\u2019d shout back, counting down the minutes\
  \ until the next marker. \n\nBut yet, somewhere behind my worries of what could\
  \ happen, lied a sneaking sense of exhilaration; a freedom felt only in the rare\
  \ and strange moments of The Unexpected. Then all at once, in one of those wicked\
  \ flashes of youth, I let go of all fear. Disregarding the potential of falling\
  \ off or being kidnapped, I suddenly and inexplicably felt wholly alive. \n\nI would\
  \ later come to know Bob, my savior, as a gentle man with a family and good heart;\
  \ a rugged type but with a veiled softness. Stephan and I had met him earlier that\
  \ day, soaking in the sulfuric bliss of a natural hot spring. Having made the mistake\
  \ of driving down a snowy, abandoned logging road, we obviously got stuck (I suppose\
  \ somewhat of a rite of passage in Canada, eh?). After 3 hours of futile digging,\
  \ Bob found us wrapped in blankets and melting snow for water. Taking disapproving\
  \ pity on our folly, he offered us a ride out on his snowmobile. Not wanting to\
  \ triple up, we got driven out to the road one at a time. I was first.\n\nUpon making\
  \ it out, I was promptly discarded at the foot of another stranger\u2019s trailer.\
  \ His name was, \u201CDwayne, like Wayne but with a D,\u201D and he immediately\
  \ invited me in for hot chocolate. Dwayne was kind, the sort of kindness I could\
  \ see in his sloping eyes, with a warmth that radiated out from a timid posture\
  \ and easy speech. Ignoring everything my mother ever told me, I followed him in.\n\
  \nHis trailer was timeworn, with tape around the door frame and a window that fell\
  \ out as he tried to open it. The wallpaper dated back decades, and everything worked\
  \ only as much as it needed to. But, despite its ramshackle appearance, it exuded\
  \ the simple pleasures of minimalism. Parked far away from the reaches of modern\
  \ society, it was evident that he, like I too, reveled in the solitude only wilderness\
  \ can provide. \n\nApologizing as he cleared a place for me on a bench, I sat down.\
  \ Noticeably unaccustomed to having guests over, he clumsily reached around me to\
  \ a crate stuffed with an assortment of provisions. \u201CDo you want the mint chocolate\
  \ cocoa, or just regular?\u201D he asked, excitedly suggesting I go for the mint\
  \ variety (which I did). Waiting for the water to boil, he summoned two dirty thermoses.\
  \ \u201CI hope you don\u2019t mind, there was only coffee in here before,\u201D\
  \ he sheepishly assured me. Ripping off a sheet of paper towel, he stuffed it down\
  \ the throats of both containers, meagerly rinsing them of their coffee stains,\
  \ then emptying packs of hot cocoa into both. \n\nAnd so for the next half hour,\
  \ we drank hot chocolate and exchanged stories, knowing full well this would likely\
  \ be the first and last time we\u2019d speak. I told him about my dream to live\
  \ in a van one day. He told me about his plans for renovations. We talked on, occasionally\
  \ laughing at the absurdity of the moment; at the string of beautifully serendipitous\
  \ events that occurred to land me in a stranger's shabby trailer, drinking hot cocoa\
  \ out of dirty mugs."
