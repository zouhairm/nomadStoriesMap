Text: "The real future of human, worth living for, is the real purpose - the past;\
  \ the last youth. It should be taught in schools, which are taught to the contrary,\
  \ and that is why we should do some nice social revolution. In order for the world\
  \ to be different and live for the sake of the young, not for the stupid, unknown\
  \ old age, which is called a liar lies: the future.\nBrody Sandor\nIt\u2019s only\
  \ been four weeks, since I moved to the flat and it\u2019s a bit early to draw a\
  \ final conclusion, but so far 2 am seems like the best time to enjoy a cigarette\
  \ before dropping myself to bed. Indoor courtyard at this point gets completely\
  \ silent; even late time lovers keep it low, including a group of local pigeons,\
  \ fluttering and screwing around four walls whole day but respecting their beloved\
  \ neighbors enough to take a break during midnight. It\u2019s a beautiful sight\
  \ of silence, those couple of hours before birds wake up, washed up nightlifers\
  \ pass through nearby streets discussing all the missed opportunities at the disco\
  \ and cleaning guys leaving the whole block shattered with butts after picking up\
  \ trash. \nFour weeks..or just about that. Does not sound like an eternity and it\
  \ isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just less than a month. And yet, you already catch yourself\
  \ finding it hard to remember, which day that shaky airplane touched down. Nah,\
  \ the only thing that was shacking on that aircraft was the bits of my soul. I even\
  \ managed to fuck it up with my first currency exchange attempt; don\u2019t do it\
  \ at the airport people, just don\u2019t, that\u2019s a rookie mistake. That\u2019\
  s what my landlord told me after few hours during our introductory meeting at the\
  \ flat. He was one of the two people I knew in this unfamiliar territory, called\
  \ Budapest. Guy, whom I barely chatted on social media and paid (yep, don\u2019\
  t judge me) security deposit online, without seeing him live, ever.\nBut fortunately\
  \ enough..he was fine human being. No hidden intensions. No hyperbolic friendliness.\
  \ Just the man doing his job. Few minutes of talk, few minutes of paperwork and\
  \ it\u2019s done. I am part of the Brody Sandor Utca family. A little chit chat\
  \ with my Ecuadorian flat mate got me hyped up. We even managed to talk life and\
  \ sing a few songs together, amigo is a self-thought guitar player and knows a few\
  \ bits of this and that. We didn\u2019t drink any tequila afterwards but it made\
  \ a great first impression. \nAnd then you realize..that you still don\u2019t know\
  \ anyone. Like, for real. There is another girl that I barely know from my own town\
  \ back home, but the fact that we never talked before doesn\u2019t actually help.\
  \ \nAt this point, loneliness kicks in. It hits you hard. Your new Ecuadorian friend\
  \ is out with his Hungarian beloved one, your Turkish flatty whom you just kindly\
  \ shook hands disappears as well. Idea comes to send a message to a girl whom you\
  \ never talked it but.. wouldn\u2019t that be a sign of weakness? I can take care\
  \ of myself, right?\nWell, sitting on the bench between the parliament is a wonderful\
  \ sight. One of the best in the world, no joke. Wandering around those utcas, utas,\
  \ teras and metroalomases with your own thoughts is kind of an experience as well.\
  \ Until you just..stop fooling yourself about all the happiness of being lone camper\
  \ in the woods..\nFour weeks. Oh mighty. Brody was a smart fella. Four weeks. I\
  \ get to meet the best bunch of flat friends one can wish for. Find the ups and\
  \ downs of the Buda and Pest (literally, check the scenery around this mighty city).\
  \ Finally meet with my neverspoken friend, which turned out to be a..promising friendship..She\
  \ is a major fan of a Mazzy Star. We talk goodbyes at the Deak Ferenc ter, she takes\
  \ a blue one. I don\u2019t even have to go anywhere. But go with the red. To the\
  \ riverside. Put my headphones on. And just look. Look on down from the bridge.\n\
  Brody Sandor, it\u2019s a pleasure to live at your street.\nHappy,\nMe"
