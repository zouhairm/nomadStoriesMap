Text: "My traveling in this 2019 will be dominated by road trip around Central Sulawesi.\
  \ Palu, the capital city of Central Sulawesi province has been my home since November\
  \ last year. Joining a humanitarian organization who did response for Central Sulawesi\
  \ since October had shifted my whole perception about travel, and life in general,\
  \ especially about the bravery to be somewhere unknown. \nWhen I came to Palu in\
  \ December, it was my first time, stepping Indonesian\u2019s land other than Java\
  \ Island. Since I was a kid, my parents moved several times from one town to other,\
  \ but all of them are in Java island. Therefore, being in Central Sulawesi for the\
  \ first time brought an excited feeling. A mixture of excited that that was my first\
  \ time of stepping part of Indonesia other than Java. However, there was a grain\
  \ of doubt and fear whether I can mingle well with local communities. I realize\
  \ that I am not a kind of easy-going person who can easily mingle with other people\
  \ even in the first met. To be able to maintain a conversation I need to know my\
  \ partner first, and it is impossible to be done in the first meeting. \nOnce I\
  \ really stepped on the ground, I see is unrecovered city. After stroke by 7.4 magnitudes\
  \ of earthquake followed with tsunami and liquefaction, the situation of Palu city\
  \ can be considered as dead city for a while. At that time, some shops already open\
  \ everyday to find new way of life. Yet the crumbled wall or building is not yet\
  \ cleaned. So, as outsiders we can see and predict the description of the terrible\
  \ event. \nOne of my memorable visits was in Kulawi district, specifically in Namo\
  \ villages. At that moment, the agenda of the visit was to facilitate children recreational\
  \ activity by accompanying them colouring and drawing. Before that, there was a\
  \ short session regarding to the hygiene promotion for kids i.e handwashing using\
  \ soap. \nDuring the entire activity, I had the opportunity to accompany particular\
  \ circle of children who sit in the fifth grade of elementary school. The activity\
  \ for these children is drawing their dream profession in the future. One child\
  \ that attract my attention called Nadin. At her paper, she drew a figure of teacher\
  \ situated in a classroom. She said that she wanted to be like the one staying in\
  \ the figure. \n\u201CI am inspired by my classroom teacher, she is so kind to us,\
  \ I want to be like her, being a teacher.\u201D  \n \nNadin wants to be fifth grade\
  \ teacher, that is the caption for her drawing\n\n\nFrom this simple and short encounter,\
  \ I feel that there is a burning fire of life especially in the eyes of the children.\
  \ Even though they might lose almost all of their belonging, even their school is\
  \ in serious damage, but they still believe that their dream must be come true once\
  \ they had the courage to do it. \nThis reminds me of the idea about bravery to\
  \ take the step to reach new place. As I told in the previous paragraph, my purpose\
  \ coming to this place is simply to step other part of Indonesia. This idea might\
  \ be broader or changed, but the thing is I need to be brave. To have hope inside\
  \ myself that I will be alright in the new place and it will be totally okay for\
  \ me to come to a new place. From Nadin in Kulawi district, I learn to always have\
  \ faith and hope also to always have and believe the dream we made. \n\nA dream\
  \ is a wish your heart makes\nWhen you're fast asleep\nIn dreams you will lose your\
  \ heartaches\nWhatever you wish for, you keep\nHave faith in your dreams and someday\n\
  Your rainbow will come smiling through\nNo matter how your heart is grieving\nIf\
  \ you keep on believing\nThe dream that you wish will come true"
