Text: "Having an elder brother who is also studious, studying yet whereas I am working,\
  \ is always a predicament to me, except for the one time I went along with mom and\
  \ dad to see him. I grew up in a beautiful hilltown, Palamaner, in Andhra Pradesh.\
  \ Dad avails LTC almost regularly and so traveling moreover became a ritual to us\
  \ once in every two years. It was December 2014 when mom decided to pay a visit\
  \ to brother at IIT Dhanbad. Voila, the stage was set, roadmap got ready, parents\
  \ and I set to Yeshwanthpur station at Bengaluru. \n\nEarly in the morning, birds\
  \ chirping besides chai vendors, we got into Duranto Express to Kolkata. Some Mistidoi,\
  \ Kati roles, fried fish on the way, we reached to IIT Dhanbad. Nothing but relaxing\
  \ for a day, we set to Kolkata. As per the plan we were to reach Howrah station,\
  \ take a cab and then catch another train to Siliguri from Sealdah. Where is the\
  \ fun when the things turn up the way they're: train got delayed, although we rushed,\
  \ missed the train at Sealdah by 5 minutes. If you want to know the value of a second-\
  \ ask an athlete preparing for Olympics, if you want to..  okay, hold on, I didn't\
  \ digress. Did I? \n\nAsking parents to stay at Sealdah station, bro and I returned\
  \ to Howrah to find the station master and get a delay letter that might give us\
  \ some space in the next train to New Jalpaiguri(NJP). The bus ride in between these\
  \ two railway stations is one heck of rollercoaster ride. 9 out of 10 times, I did\
  \ bet that driver dada will crash someone, but quite soon I realised that it was\
  \ a losing streak so stopped betting thereafter, such is their driving abracadabra.\
  \ We were busy munching food until dad called us to return to Sealdah since meanwhile\
  \ dad used his ex-army mantra to make acquaintance with the Captain of the army\
  \ men traveling to NJP and thus securing two seats for four of us. That night was\
  \ full of army jokes, but that's a different story. \n\nWe woke up in NJP. Hotel\
  \ room, shower, getting ready happened too quick to relaize and we were in a Tata\
  \ Sumo to Darjeeling. The trip for next 4-5 hours was something still afresh in\
  \ my mind. The army base camps, tea gardens, tall trees, clear roads, partly sunny\
  \ and partly murky skies, fair women, landscapes that were just screensavers to\
  \ us till then, bread pakodas, steep curves, co-traveling clouds, cedar trees, trees\
  \ known and unknown, distant visuals of beautiful urbanisation on the top of the\
  \ hills, skilful drivers, cheerful tourists and finally.. period. \n\nIt was evening\
  \ already, mom and I stayed back at hotel. Dad and Bro got some hot noodles and\
  \ bread-omelette which didn't last long for our cravings, but it got darker by then.\
  \ The very first thing in the morning is Tiger Hills, I had the audacity to go just\
  \ wearing a shirt and the typical Darjeeling December chills were clingy than I\
  \ ever thought. \n\nWe visited other places of interest, the train, Pasupathi pathi\
  \ market in Nepal and then started to Kalimpong. Here is something to mention, we\
  \ as a family traveled not just to take photographs, tick-mark and then never visit\
  \ there, but in fact to feel and breathe the air of that place. We loved the roads,\
  \ rivers and airs and so we traveled, traveling and will travel till the tickmarks\
  \ on our maps end up tearing the sheet. We might buy new maps again; so we witnessed\
  \ snowfall, stopped by, got drenched and woke up to an understanding why people\
  \ use blue skies to connote happiness, I rest my thoughts about snow here. \n\n\
  The road trip to Kalimpong was the next level rollercoaster ride, perhaps the roads\
  \ were under repair then, but on the bright side that was a chance to register every\
  \ scenic beauty on the way. The next two to three days were ineffable. Some of the\
  \ portraits of heaven displayed in my childhood Sunday school were just there. \n\
  \n\"O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.\"\nPsalms 92:5"
