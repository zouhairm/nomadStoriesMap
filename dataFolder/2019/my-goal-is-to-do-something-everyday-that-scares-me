Text: "We exchanged emails for a couple of weeks. My heart would flutter with excitement\
  \ when I could see that he sent me and new message. And yet, I was hesitant and\
  \ afraid to meet him. I had been divorced for years and had felt very safe and comfortable\
  \ in the life I had created. Then came his email that said\u201D how can I talk\
  \ to you from my heart when I am a terrible typist and English is not my mother\u2019\
  s tongue?\u201D  \n      My heart stopped beating as I tried to ponder the answer\
  \ to his question. I then gave myself the opportunity to get real and look into\
  \ my soul. It was then that I was reminded of the quote that \u201CReal love takes\
  \ real risks\u201D. I typed back that I would meet him at the local coffee shop\
  \ that night at 8:00. \n      When I walked into the local coffee shop he was already\
  \ seated. Our eyes connected. I could tell his lips were moving and that he was\
  \ speaking with a heavy accent. It was then that I realized our verbal communication\
  \ was  insignificant in as much as we instantly had the ability to connect to each\
  \ other  on a much deeper level. I knew at that very moment our lives would never\
  \ be the same. And so, let the journey begin."
