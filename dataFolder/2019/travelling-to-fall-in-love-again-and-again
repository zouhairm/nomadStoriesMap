Text: "The time, the geographic position, the weather, the culture, the people around\
  \ you and the scenery, all these elements affect the mood, the way of thinking,\
  \ the appreciation of the moment\u2026 in a way or another. People sometimes need\
  \ to go far from the place where they live, in order to escape from the routine,\
  \ the ups and downs of life, the dos and don\u2019ts of work, the miscomprehension\
  \ of others or just to breath fresh air, to see picturesque lakes, beaches, mountains\u2026\
  \ or to visit historical monuments haunted by unforgettable memories.\nTravelling\
  \ doesn\u2019t mean only \u201Cmake a journey, typically of some length\u201D. It\
  \ seems to be in touch with different cultures, to taste various foods, wear traditional\
  \ costumes, and attend iconic festivals, shows and concert. Travelling helps to\
  \ enlarge the knowledge, to change the angle of view and critics, to be in contact\
  \ with different mentalities, to contemplate others civilizations, to discover contrasting\
  \ architectures.\nI still remember my dinner in Leander tower in Istanbul. It is\
  \ a kind of love tower, built with rocks that mirror the strength of love. The light\
  \ and the sounds of waves tell you to appreciate every second and fall in love with\
  \ the nature again and again and forever.\nI fall in love again with my husband\
  \ and I appreciated the scenery, the music of nature, I want to live more, to work\
  \ hard, to earn money so that I could visit others pieces of heaven on earth. I\
  \ fall in love with all the things that are around me, on my view travel is like\
  \ cold water for a fasting person in desert, is like light in caves in perpetual\
  \ darkness\u2026\n\n\nGuergabou Souaad\nWith my love"
