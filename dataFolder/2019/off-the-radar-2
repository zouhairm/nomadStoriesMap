Text: "\u201CAnd remember, you can\u2019t have just one, you need to have three. The\
  \ first one was bitter, like life. Try this one: it\u2019s sweet like love.\u201D\
  \ She poured me a second cup of tea.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the third one?\u201D\n\
  \n\u201CI\u2019ll tell you later, they\u2019re waiting for us!\u201D Shahed grabbed\
  \ my arm and I felt how she peeled me off the red carpet and dragged me towards\
  \ the crowd. \n\nWe sat on the back of the old yellow truck and before the other\
  \ cars were filled with people, we set off. Our driver took off on what felt like\
  \ an imaginary runway and the orangy sand started to become part of our attire.\
  \ We soon had sand in our shoes, on our skin, and probably also in our souls. My\
  \ new friend looked out at the skyline, as if trying to make out the edge of the\
  \ desert. Have you been to one before? For the most part, it\u2019s not quite a\
  \ photogenic composition of sand dunes, especially here, in Tindouf. The land on\
  \ which the refugee camps sit is a vast extension of crude, harsh soil somewhere\
  \ in the Algerian Sahara, where you can never see the end. \n\nDozens of Sahrawis\
  \ and a few Spanish supporters were rocketing west, ready to claim their freedom\
  \ back. As I saw how the other vehicles caught up, my heart started to race. We\
  \ were there to help them recover a voice that had been long muted, to add up to\
  \ the noise. We were there to make up for once leaving them far behind. \n\nWith\
  \ no other waypoint than the sun, the convoy made a sharp right turn and we all\
  \ squeezed together on the left sides of our rusty trucks. \u201CI remember Spain,\u201D\
  \ Shahed grinned. \u201CThat program, remember? A family from Malaga hosted us every\
  \ summer. It was fun.\u201D I knew of it from my neighbors in Alicante. They\u2019\
  d been hosting Sahrawi children for many years, and at the end of August, I always\
  \ had mixed feelings.\n\n\u201CDoesn\u2019t it make it worse? Experiencing what\
  \ you could have and then coming back to this?\u201D I was sure I hadn\u2019t asked\
  \ this out loud, and I really wish I didn\u2019t, but I must have done so since\
  \ Shahed then started to ramble about her time in Malaga. \n\n\u201CNot only did\
  \ I swim in the sea for the first time, but I also understood that there is something\
  \ out there to long for, that there is a place where the fight for freedom and rights\
  \ has a completely different meaning. You guys also go on all-included holidays\
  \ to then get back to your small cubicles and go on with your lives, don\u2019t\
  \ you?\u201D\n\nThe truck came to a halt next to a tree that seemed to await a spring\
  \ that would never come. And there it was, a massive wall that stretched out before\
  \ us. \n\u201CWe\u2019re too far away from it, let\u2019s get closer,\u201D my naive,\
  \ younger self blurted out. \n\u201CYou wait here, getting closer is too dangerous.\u201D\
  \ I didn\u2019t understand. \n\n\u201CBut what about you?\u201D She pulled out a\
  \ flask and handed it to me. \n\n\u201CHere, have the third one. It\u2019s soft,\
  \ like death.\u201D\n\nThe Sahrawis set off and I stayed by the cars with resignation,\
  \ along with the rest of the Spanish team. As the sun set, I saw how the dusking\
  \ sky drew a picture on the horizon. A picture that I that could well serve as an\
  \ idyllic postcard should the silhouettes carved in the orange canvas were not my\
  \ friends marching towards a wall crying for freedom. \n\nI sipped at my tea, trying\
  \ to find some comfort in its softness."
