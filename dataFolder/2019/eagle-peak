Text: "My 18th birthday--halfway into my first semester of university in San Francisco\
  \ and on American Thanksgiving in November--I decided to embark upon my own solo\
  \ excursion through the sprawling headlands of Northern California \xE0 la Alexander\
  \ Vandertramp/Christopher McCandless. While it seemed all my peers and new-found\
  \ friends were either going home, to Baja, or to Lake Tahoe, I began my hejira in\
  \ the hopes of gaining something--insight, wisdom, perhaps a revelation of sorts--that\
  \ the ritual of becoming a legal adult seemed to carry with it. Being an inexperienced\
  \ yet zealous camper, I packed my bag with gear, books, water bottles, and a conservative\
  \ amount of chewy bars for sustenance. In keeping with my professed desire for asceticism,\
  \ I decided that I would fast for the duration of the trip in the hope of eliciting\
  \ some natural hallucinations. (The bars were in case of emergency.) In millennial\
  \ fashion, an Uber dropped me off at the base of the camp and I eagerly began my\
  \ ascent to the top of Eagle Peak, where I would be making camp. As the sun began\
  \ to lower in the sky and cast the lake behind me with an orange tint over the water\
  \ smooth as black glass, I started hiking. Quite soon into the hike, the sun began\
  \ to set until I was bathed in complete darkness but for a small flashlight, and\
  \ it seemed at the all the sounds and smells of the forest--the possible hiss of\
  \ a faraway rattlesnake, the smell of birch and pine, seemed to heighten. The air\
  \ was cold and sepulchrally quiet. At last, I reached my base, where a small wooden\
  \ square frame dividing the space for a tent from the rest of the dirt stood across\
  \ from a decrepit wooden bench. I looked at my home for the next few days with a\
  \ mix of naive anticipation and dread: having grown up in a bustling Canadian metropolis\
  \ I knew very little about the world of the outdoors but saw something exotically\
  \ profound in it. It took me almost an hour to set up my tent, after which I gratefully\
  \ retreated into it and curled up in the foetal position. The first night was very\
  \ cold, and in the late hours an animal came to my tent and began sniffing and pawing\
  \ at the exterior. The next day I went for a hike around the perimeter and read\
  \ a chapter of Siddhartha. It seemed from my little peak that I was the only person\
  \ in the entire world, almost as if all the way from the top of the peak my own\
  \ shadow was reflected in the lake miles away. The second night was like the first.\
  \ In the daytime, I languished in my hunger, but persisted. I meditated and was\
  \ hungry. The leaves seemed to grow greener, the air at once fresher and saltier\
  \ from the ocean west of me. The next night was equally cold yet, perhaps, a little\
  \ less terrifying. In the daytime, I seemed to gain strength from the beauty of\
  \ the nature around me (plus a sheepish nibble of a granola bar). The night-time\
  \ was bearable. On my last day, I ventured down the other side of the mountain to\
  \ discover what stretch of eternity lay before me, and was shocked to discover a\
  \ parking lot filled with runners and picnics. Suddenly I became overcome with gratitude\
  \ and love for all the strangers around me, and when I got back to my campsite,\
  \ I seemed to have stripped away whatever isolationism I had gained from my sojourn.\
  \ As I walked back along the highway to civilization, sticking my thumb out, on\
  \ Thanksgiving day, I smiled thinking about how excited I was to re-join the living,\
  \ to talk to and listen to others, to fall into my bed, and I felt something profound\
  \ on that day: gratitude."
