Text: "Located in the extreme northeastern part of Luzon, the Philippine's largest\
  \ island, is a tiny 31-sq. mi. island called Palaui. Named as having the 10th best\
  \ beach in the world by CNN, my friend and I decided to visit the island to give\
  \ it a look-see. We took a one-hour plane ride from Manila to the city of Tuguegarao\
  \ in the province of Cagayan and then took a 3-hour van ride to the town of Sta.\
  \ Ana. At the port of Sta. Ana was a very welcoming, barefooted young man waiting\
  \ to whisk us off to our island of destination on a 30-minute boat ride.\n\nAt the\
  \ island we were greeted by a charming mother of four in her 40s, our host for our\
  \ entire visit as homestay is the only safe and somewhat comfortable lodging option\
  \ in the island. We called her \"nay\" from nanay in Tagalog meaning mother. It\
  \ was the start of an amazing experience of the world-famous Filipino hospitality.\
  \ We felt we belonged to the family. They gave the entire house to us and the whole\
  \ family transferred to a smaller house just across the street. Our meal requests,\
  \ our beds, and each of our every little need were all taken cared of in detail.\
  \ With the island having no electric power, the family's ingenuity of using a car\
  \ battery powering some of their electric sockets was our only hope to charge our\
  \ phones during the day as we picked up the intermittent cellular signal from the\
  \ mainland. With no running potable water, we were guided to tiny stores selling\
  \ bottled water and some grocery items. With the absence of my favorite red wine,\
  \ the family's suggestion of the good-tasting Philippine-made rum and the super\
  \ cheap full body massage offer that we took, made our nights.  We slept only with\
  \ the moonlight.\n\nWe would wake up every morning making a few hurried steps from\
  \ our beds to the beach shore to catch the stunning sunrise as soon as we see the\
  \ blazing red sunlight penetrating our windows. After which our breakfast would\
  \ already be nicely setup on the house porch. Some of our day moments were spent\
  \ with locals touring the neighborhood, the only school in the island and the other\
  \ end of the beach away from our homestay place as it has a better sand quality.\
  \ Other times were spent also with locals exploring Crocodile Island, lazing on\
  \ the immaculate Anguib Beach in the nearby mainland and finally reaching Cape Enga\xF1\
  o with its picturesque beach and lighthouse. The scenery at the cape is truly breathtaking\
  \ and is worthy of the rough boat ride that even the TV series Survivor used the\
  \ entire island for one season. \n\nWith heavy hearts we prepared to leave our \"\
  home\" and say goodbye to our \"family\" on the third day. With the laid-back island\
  \ life, stunning above water scenery and teeming sea life capped with the unmatched\
  \ hospitality of our hosts, we already fell in love with the place and the people.\
  \ In September of 2018, I remembered my \"family\" once again as Typhoon Mangkhut\
  \ battered the tiny island heavily.  As I lost all my contacts with the islanders\
  \ in my old phone, all I could do was hope and pray they were evacuated early and\
  \ now back in the island trying to start life all over again. I am hoping someday\
  \ I would see them again, still mostly barefooted and full of smiles."
