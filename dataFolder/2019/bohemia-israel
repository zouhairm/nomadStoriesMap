  \ Wall\u2019 in nearby Jerusalem as a private significance boggles the mind!\n\n\
  As a seemingly valiant, vibrant veteran, my recommendations soar highly through\

  \ look into the past providing the answers to our future is the creation of a movie\
  \ in the making, starring a resilient supporting cast.\n\nA modern touch on the\
  \ general, everyday school field trip entertaining risky international borders strongly\
  \ thriving on conflict, highlighting war and tragedy over the ultimate peace prize!\n\
