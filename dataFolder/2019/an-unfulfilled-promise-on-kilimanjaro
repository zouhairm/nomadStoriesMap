Text: "The pain in my head was immense. The night restless. The realization setting\
  \ in.\n\nI knew I was too sick to continue on. I knew the cough that kept me awake\
  \ all night pointed to an early descent. I knew that my hallucinations and rain-soaked\
  \ clothes were far from ideal. I knew my dream of summiting, a dream I have dwelled\
  \ upon countless times for the past 5 years, had slipped from my grasp.\n\nI first\
  \ suspected my adventure would be cut short somewhere between the Lava Tower and\
  \ Karanga Camp. I was just 15 hours away from the summit push, but I would not be\
  \ a part of it.\n\nHaving grown up at the base of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado,\
  \ climbing the vast and innumerable peaks in my backyard has always been an essential\
  \ aspect of my lifestyle. I am most alive on an elevated trail with stunning vistas\
  \ surrounding me. It is in those moments, with a crisp breeze upon my face, the\
  \ heat of the sun on my neck, and the sound of melting snow trickling through the\
  \ rocks, that my mind finds clarity and my heart finds solace.\n\nThe idea came\
  \ slowly, but steadily, for months, perhaps even years. I had enjoyed the summit\
  \ of dozens of Colorado\u2019s high peaks, what us locals call the \u201C14ers,\u201D\
  \ mountains over 14,000 feet. I had conquered some of the toughest routes in the\
  \ most remote areas of the state. I wanted to check off every summit I could, but\
  \ I also wanted more. More than what my beloved home state could offer. There was\
  \ a void and I had to fill it.\n\nIt started with my personal obsession of mountaineering.\
  \ I studied the lists of the Seven Summits for years and took note of each mountain\u2019\
  s accessibility, technical requirements, elevation, and length of time to summit.\
  \ Everest was out of the question. I had neither the time nor money for such a feat.\
  \ Aconcagua was in the remote Andes and also took weeks to finish. Elbrus in Europe\
  \ had some promise, but it was always going to be Kilimanjaro.\n\nI had seen the\
  \ photos of friends on the summit. I had read Hemingway\u2019s hauntingly descriptive\
  \ short story. I recognized its features in the opening of the Lion King. Kilimanjaro\
  \ has supplanted itself and its image into the popular culture of our minds and\
  \ innate desires for adventure. I just had to wait for the right time to do it and\
  \ people to do it with.\n\nAfter a couple more seasons of 14er climbing, I was growing\
  \ restless. I was weary of being a weekend warrior, driving straight to a trailhead\
  \ on Friday after work, summiting as many mountains as I could, and driving back\
  \ in time for Monday in the office. I had to change it up. \n\nFinally, my cousin\
  \ Ryan, the intrepid traveler that he is, reached out about going on a trip. He\
  \ did not know where he wanted to go, but he knew I always had some crazy idea brewing.\
  \ So I told him about Kilimanjaro. I told him about the various routes, the high\
  \ likelihood of us reaching the summit, and the beauty that was the country of Tanzania.\n\
  \nHe was on board immediately and I thus had my travel buddy. We settled on the\
  \ end of September 2017. My other cousin, Michael, would join and my commitment\
  \ to a contract job was ending. It was perfect timing. I climbed 10 14ers to train.\
  \ I bought all the new gear I would need. I was ready to go and excited to check\
  \ this off my bucket list.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. Lava Tower rests\
  \ at over 15,000 feet. That\u2019s the highest I had ever been. I developed symptoms\
  \ of altitude sickness shortly after. The medication did nothing. Descending did\
  \ nothing.\n\nLong before our fearless guide, Chambo, came to my tent on the sixth\
  \ morning, I knew what he would say. My dream was over. My body spent. But not without\
  \ reward. Sure, I did not make the summit. But I nevertheless experienced the stunning\
  \ vistas of Kilimanjaro, its winds upon my face, the sun on my neck. It was beautiful."
