Text: "I notice an older man carefully observing us. I glance to my right and see\
  \ my travel companions. Four men and myself riding ramshackle bicycles across Australia\
  \ with our backpacks tied to the frames. Why? Simply because it felt like the thing\
  \ to do at the moment. One month in, exhausted, dirty, and always insatiably hungry\
  \ we needed very little persuasion to stop at a free community barbecue and eat\
  \ until we couldn\u2019t possibly continue riding. Laying in the grass with all\
  \ of our worldly possessions strewn carelessly around us, we eat hot dog after hot\
  \ dog and enjoy Australia\u2019s considerably more lenient public drinking policy.\
  \ Finally, curiosity wins and the man pulls up his chair and asks just what in the\
  \ hell we are up to. Kevin, the most charismatic of us by far, regales him with\
  \ tales of broken chains and flat tires, of arduous days with flies covering our\
  \ faces while we cling to our handlebars praying for a downhill. He details every\
  \ hardship with the same relish that he finishes his third hot dog with. The man\u2019\
  s eyes light up, \u201Chave you ever been shark fishing?\u201D We glance to each\
  \ other. No, none of us have. \u201CWhere are you sleeping tonight?\u201D Again,\
  \ we all glance to each other. How do we explain that we didn\u2019t make it past\
  \ the free hot dogs? The man tells us about a public park up the road that we can\
  \ pitch our tents in and tells us to meet him at 6 am the next morning. Delighted\
  \ to only add a quarter-mile to our biking experience that day, we agree.\nBleary-eyed\
  \ and stumbling we find the boat dock in the early morning. But our eyes do not\
  \ stay half closed for long, a huge fishing boat awaits us complete with a large\
  \ griddle that our newfound friend is frying breakfast on. We clamber aboard again\
  \ led to adventure by our stomachs. We do not catch a shark that day. Instead, we\
  \ catch white fish and various terrifying Australian creatures. We laugh and I watch\
  \ as the men drink beer. As our new friend considers me a \u201Clady\u201D, he only\
  \ offers me lemonade. After nearly a month of being treated as \u201Cone of the\
  \ guys\u201D in every single aspect of the term, I can\u2019t help but be a little\
  \ bit charmed. I drink the lemonade. We miss the tide and spend eight hours stuck\
  \ in the mud. We get sunburns and talk about what it means to explore and see the\
  \ world. He tells us every joke he knows, eyes twinkling at every punchline. Without\
  \ my knowledge the boys have let the man in on a secret, it happens to be my birthday.\
  \ He returns to our camp later that evening with a cake and a couple bottles of\
  \ wine. He helps the boys hang lights and fry fish while a handful of koalas aggressively\
  \ snore above us. We will never find out if this man had any children. We will never\
  \ find out why he took a ragtag group of dirty and clueless Americans out for the\
  \ entire day. We will never hear from him again, though he would give us his address\
  \ and we would promise to send him a postcard when we finally reached wherever it\
  \ was we were going. But in this moment, on this night, we were a family. We would\
  \ experience genuine human connection in its truest form. Though this man would\
  \ never know because I would never get the chance to tell him, this would be one\
  \ of the best birthdays of my entire life. Travel allows us to see strangers as\
  \ friends, it allows us to become entirely more intimate than we allow ourselves\
  \ in our daily life. Without a home, without the familiarities of our own culture,\
  \ we are somehow free to connect with others in a way that we just cannot do in\
  \ our own everyday settings. I often wonder what happened to that man. I wonder\
  \ if he thinks of us and wonders if we ever made it to where we were going. Most\
  \ of all, I wonder if he knows how great of a story he gave us."
