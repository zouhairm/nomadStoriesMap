Text: "Journey of the 7 day trek to 16000ft mountain begin with an idea of visiting\
  \ Himalayas atleast once a year. \n\n4 friends joined hands to ensure that the plan\
  \ doesn't remain on paper. Tickets booked, jounrey was on. Constant twists and turns\
  \ on the journey to that first sighting of Mt. Trishul lead to us to base camp,\
  \ Lohajung. Entire trek has mythological reference to Lord Shiva's journey with\
  \ Parvathi. \n\nCold weather, Mighty mountains, Deep Valleys and wonderful people\
  \ encapsules the description of Lohajung. Starting the journey onwards to the peak,\
  \ The Himalayas showed us the might. The tiring five hour Journey to the Didna,\
  \ a hill village cut off from mainstream land. The continuous rise of the altitude\
  \ and the cosntant weight on the back take a good physical and mental toll on the\
  \ body. It was such a delight to find a bed to hit as soon as we reach Didna. \n\
  \nGood rest ensured physical and mental preparation for the coming day. We were\
  \ going to go from 8500ft to 12500ft in a day crossing the tree lines into the lush\
  \ green meadows. The bugyals(medaows) on the way to Roopkund are one of the largest\
  \ in Himalayas. The walk from tree line to medaows brings the challenge of Altitude\
  \ Mountain Sickness (AMS) due to reduction of oxygen availability. But, the continuous\
  \ walk on the green medaows is nothing less than a massage to your foot. Finally,\
  \ after a long trek of almost 4-5 hrs, you reach Bedni Bugyal. The camps are set\
  \ overlooking the might Mt. Trishul. One can witness the magical golden moment,\
  \ sunset behind the Mt. Trishul, distinct sound of streams flowing down the mountains,\
  \ cold chill weather and starry nights with milky way on full HD display. Such is\
  \ the diversity of this place. \n\nNext day, rise of elevation is from 12500ft to\
  \ 14500ft which means that AMS is going to take full effect on the body. With trail\
  \ continuously rising, you reach temple, Kalu Vinayak temple. Small Ganesha Temple\
  \ at elevation of 14500ft, is start of snowline for the trek in regular weather.\
  \ For the person who has never seen snow in his life, this was a divine moment to\
  \ feel the snow, the cold feeling in your hand. This out of the feeling world pushes\
  \ sudden adrenaline forgetting all the tiredness of the 4hrs long trek, and brings\
  \ the kid in you and forces you start a snow fight with your partners. 20mins walk\
  \ from here is final camp before the summit, Bhagwabasa. \n\nFinal day, the moment\
  \ for which the entire hardship was faced, starts early in the morning at 3am as\
  \ the snow is hard and easy to climb. The AMS is at the peak, oxygen levels have\
  \ dropped significantly, body is weak but there is adrenaline pumping to push you\
  \ to reach the summit. Good nice walk for 3 hours rising from 14500ft to 15696ft\
  \ takes you to Roopkund Lake. Extremely difficult hike brings extreme delight when\
  \ you start at the edge of the lake and realise that you have reached the point.\
  \ \n\nYou have leapt into unknown world, a place where your body doesn't acclimatize\
  \ easily, the stay isn't comfortable cabins with beds. It will all be worth it when\
  \ you stand at the edge of the lake and tears are sure to roll down the cheek. \n\
  \nAs much as mountains are delight, you realise that nothing can beat the comfort\
  \ of home. Descent is hard on your knees and toes. You start your descent and travel\
  \ back through the same route to find this beautiful flowers, rhododendron. After\
  \ constant Maggi treats, the rhododendron juice is quite tasty drink. \n\nYou finally\
  \ come out of the forest and reach the mainland and smile. That smile gives away\
  \ 1000s of feelings at once and you will know that point that you had leapt into\
  \ the unknown."
