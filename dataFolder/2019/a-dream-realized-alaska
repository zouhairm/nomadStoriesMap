Text: "Alaska may as well be on another planet. Vast expanses of tundra, sweeping\
  \ vistas, mountian ecosystems teeming with wildlife oceans filled with innumerable\
  \ species unique aquatic species. \nOur Alaska excursion started with a grand voyage\
  \ from our home in Montana across Canada. Arriving in Alaska we ventured to Wrangell\
  \ St. Elias National Park, hiking the Kennicot glacier, fishing the salmon streams,\
  \ and taking in the grandeur of the nations largest national park. \nFrom there\
  \ we drove to Valdez, crossing Thompson Pass, which is one of the most impressive\
  \ views i have ever seen from a highway. Monumental peaks soar out of the ocean\
  \ upwards of 5000\u2019. The view is hard to encapsulate in words or pictures, it\
  \ truly has to be experienced personally to comprehend. The scenery was only rivaled\
  \ by the fishing, which was unlike anything I had ever experienced. Watching pods\
  \ of salmon, some 1000 fish strong, was unlike anything I had experienced on my\
  \ home waters in Western Montana. Fly rod in hand, in one evening I must have landed\
  \ 60 salmon, with the help of wife working the net diligently as I brought them\
  \ close to shore. As we released each fish back into the ocean I would find myself\
  \ giggling uncontrollably at the generousosity of the ocean.  \nAs much as I wanted\
  \ to stay and fish, we had more places to see. We traveled to Seward, and hopped\
  \ on a tour boat, exploring the magnificent shorelines that is Kenai Fjords National\
  \ Park. Abundant sea creatures, from otters, to pelicans, and of course giagantic\
  \ whales treated us to an unbelievable sensory experience. The ocean mist coating\
  \ us as we cruised through the tangled shore lines.\nFrom there we pointed ourselves\
  \ north, toward \u201CThe Great One\u201D. Denali is truly a sight to behold. We\
  \ first saw the mountian some 150 miles away. It appeared as a apparition on the\
  \ horizon line, vaguely resembling a mountian. The closer we got, the bigger the\
  \ mountain became. By the time we loaded the tour bus going into the park, we were\
  \ overwhelmed by our good fortune. Statistically only 3 out of 10 people ever see\
  \ the peak during their visit. We had seen it from 150 miles away, and now on the\
  \ tour bus, a blue bird beautiful day, the mountian glimmering in front of us steadfast\
  \ and bold. One of the biggest mountains in the world, Denali showed us al it\u2019\
  s glory for three days. We fell asleep that night camped out near the base of the\
  \ mountian, surrounded by one of the most beautiful landscapes in North America.\
  \ Not only was the landscape stunning, but the wildlife was nothing short of amazing.\
  \ Grizzlies scouring the hillsides searching for berries, bands of caribou moving\
  \ effortlessly across the tundra, and the great Dall sheep perched high on the mountian\
  \ looking down at us from their commanding veiws. \nBeing from Montana, I\u2019\
  m no stranger to magnificent landscapes, but Alaska is in an entirely other level.\
  \ It is without a doubt a treasured place, full of natural wonder. To travel there\
  \ and be immersed in it is life changing. To anyone looking to see one of the last\
  \ great wildernesses on this planet, Alaska is not to missed."
