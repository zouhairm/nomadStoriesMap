Text: "Blaring horns and the sound of thousands of vehicles clanged around inside\
  \ my clouded head as my mind struggled to catch up to the scenery my eyes presented\
  \ to it.  Twenty hours of travel later, I was having my first experience outside\
  \ of North America in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.  No amount of blogs, photos, or videos\
  \ could have prepared me for undergoing such a drastic change in culture than being\
  \ fully immersed in it.\n\nThe road swelled from 5 lanes of traffic to 6 with no\
  \ discernible difference in the actual road markings.  The traffic was one new scenario\
  \ but watching the other people and buildings along the road was quite another.\
  \  Mothers held their newborn children at intersections and walked through the lines\
  \ of cars, men waited in line at the open-air butcher to buy and eat raw meat, donkeys\
  \ pulled carts as part of their taxi system, and the varied types of clothing ranged\
  \ from full robes to just shorts.  The heat easily overcame the overworked air conditioning\
  \ in the car adding to the atmosphere and widening the gap between my current position\
  \ and the wintry weather I had left at home.  We jockeyed for car positioning the\
  \ entire ride back to our host\u2019s home in the city, and we finally made it with\
  \ the sun\u2019s light fading into dusk.\n\nDinner was waiting for us as we went\
  \ inside the house and sure, I had eaten at the local Ethiopian restaurant at home,\
  \ but flavors, love, and cultural understanding must not translate completely across\
  \ the ocean as another unexplored area of life was provided to me by this trip and\
  \ it was becoming hard to keep pace.\n\nIn the morning we set off for Awash National\
  \ Park to see local wildlife but also go on a tour led by one of the members from\
  \ the Afar tribe.  The drive to the park went through many villages with farmers\
  \ hauling their carts of produce to the road.  Oranges must have been in season\
  \ as they were the prominent product, but sugar cane was also being sold along with\
  \ fruits that I had never seen before.  The further away from the city we drove,\
  \ the more desolate looking the villages and a smaller selection of produce was\
  \ seen.\n\nOnce we made it to the huts we were staying at for our stay in Awash,\
  \ we met our guides for the trip into the wild to see hyenas coming out of their\
  \ cave for the night hunting.  One of the guides was a very traditional member of\
  \ the Afar tribe with white robes and bare feet while the second guide was a member\
  \ of the military holding a rifle and in camouflage clothing.  We had to drive towards\
  \ the lookout point and I shared the backseat with the tribesman on one side and\
  \ the armed guard on the other while our host drove into the dessert.\n\nThe setting\
  \ was perfect as we overlooked the mouth of the cave and the laughing hyenas ran\
  \ out once the sun had disappeared into a dark night full of stars in an unpolluted\
  \ sky.  The experience would be unforgettable, but the ending was yet to come. \
  \ As we drove back to the camp through the dessert on a sand covered road, our car\
  \ got stuck on top of a sand dune and soon the sand pushed its way through the air\
  \ vents even.\n\nEveryone got out to inspect the situation.  Without so much as\
  \ a word spoken across language barriers, the driver returned to the wheel while\
  \ my two new companions and I began to push as sand and rocks were kicked up by\
  \ the wheels.  Inch by inch we gained ground until finally the car gained traction\
  \ again and pulled onto the main road leaving us behind.  Maybe it was the circumstances\
  \ or fate that drew us all together, but I will always have this in my memory as\
  \ the car sped off to higher ground and we ran after it through sand and stone with\
  \ fists pumping the air and yells of encouragement and excitement to rival the hyenas\
  \ as we ran like a pack of our own!"
