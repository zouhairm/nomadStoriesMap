Text: "The amazing waterfalls of Iguaz\xFA makes you feel that your are nothing. Iguaz\xFA\
  \ was the stop at the middle of my trip through South America, knowing that it remained\
  \ a month to go, but no more money by the end of this little adventure at the Iguaz\xFA\
  \ Park. But you know the thirst that you feel when you are a traveler. It is necessary\
  \ to go on so nobody can tell you how it feels. You have to feel it, know it, try\
  \ it. At the moment that I was walking by the bridges and watching all the trees,\
  \ feeling the coldest and wettest winter that I felt before, never imagined what\
  \ I would feel when I saw La Garganta del Diablo. That\u2019s the name of the biggest\
  \ waterfall in Iguaz\xFA, it means \u201Cthe throat of the Devil\u201D. Easily could\
  \ seduce me and swallow me in to it. Nevertheless, it was kind and just let me speechless,\
  \ I would describe it as a breathtaking sight. No doubt. It made me feel so tiny,\
  \ unprotected. But also brave because I got that far. And now I feel grateful because\
  \ I was able to maintain this feeling in my mind almost for four years."
