Text: "I stopped to catch my breath \u2013 days of wandering around museums had not\
  \ prepared me for this. It was hot, despite being early June, and I felt the pale\
  \ grasses lining the road were baking with me as I climbed the one hill in all of\
  \ Holland. \n\tIn my past two weeks of circling the tiny country, I\u2019d made\
  \ it around by bicycle, train, and foot. It had felt easy across the flat landscape.\
  \ But now, in Maastricht, I was wishing I\u2019d sprung for a bus ticket. \n\tI\u2019\
  d come to Holland to stay with relatives near Amsterdam. My mother\u2019s parents\
  \ emigrated from Holland in the 1950\u2019s, and retained thick accents and a love\
  \ for sprinkles on toast throughout their lives. My grandmother passed away some\
  \ years before; my grandpa was 91 and claimed a daily Heineken kept him in such\
  \ good health. I grew up in Canada and wanted to see the country where they grew\
  \ up.  \n\tI planned to stay with relatives and do day trips. After five days, my\
  \ cousins suggested that I explore over longer periods. I packed two t-shirts, a\
  \ travel guide, and my notebook, and told them I\u2019d be back in three days, max.\
  \ \n\tTwo weeks later, I was still going.  \n\tThat trip was my first time travelling\
  \ solo. I had been hesitant to leave the Dutch cousins because I was afraid of travelling\
  \ alone. What if I got mugged? What if I got lost? What if I was lonely? \n\tI got\
  \ lost at least once a day, made friends at every hostel, and luckily never got\
  \ mugged. \n\tAnd I discovered the joy of travelling solo. I could do whatever I\
  \ wanted, whenever I wanted. If I wanted to spend four hours in a museum? Or spend\
  \ all day roaming around a cathedral? If I loved a place and wanted to extend my\
  \ stay? \n\tIt was completely fine.\n\tI didn\u2019t have to worry whether anyone\
  \ else was having fun. I didn\u2019t have to have a plan. I could just go. \n\t\
  That freedom brought me to Maastricht. I read \u201Cfull of history\u201D and \u201C\
  beautiful\u201D in my guidebook, and boarded a train. \n\tThe southernmost city\
  \ in Holland, it dips down from the bottom of the country like a puzzle piece that\
  \ doesn\u2019t fit. It\u2019s been retained as Dutch territory throughout multiple\
  \ wars because it seemed too weak of a point to hold, so nobody ever bothered to\
  \ fight over it.  \n\tBut Maastricht was still prepared. When I eventually made\
  \ it to the top of that hill, I took a guided tour of my destination: the Fort St.\
  \ Pieter. \n\tThe fort was built in 1701-1702 and completed in eleven months because\
  \ of fears of an attack (which never came). From the top you could see Belgium,\
  \ to the west, and Germany, thirty kilometres east. \n\tNext, I followed my guide\
  \ into the tunnels that lay below.  \n\tUnlike the fort, the tunnels weren\u2019\
  t built for military purposes, but for mining. Created by many individual miners\
  \ with no rhyme or reason, the tunnels became a labyrinth.\n\tThe walls held scribbles\
  \ of past visitors, dating back to 1945. Canadian soldiers, after the end of World\
  \ War II, had been there. There were signatures of people from my hometown. \n\t\
  I spent three more days in Maastricht, being continually amazed. I slept in a a\
  \ boat-turned-hotel floating on the river Maas. One day for breakfast, I had strawberry-rhubarb\
  \ vlaai (pie) that had been made using the bakery\u2019s still-operating, 7th century\
  \ water-wheel powered flour mill. I visited a blood-red church, Sint Janskerk, and\
  \ met people outside of it who had travelled from all over to see the Sint Servaasbasiliek,\
  \ which holds the grave of the only Saint to be buried in the Netherlands. Later,\
  \ I visited a hotel basement that featured a restaurant and remnants of a Roman\
  \ settlement from the 2nd century. \n\tMaastricht was so cool, I wasn\u2019t sure\
  \ why the other cities were even still trying. Like much of Holland, the longer\
  \ I spent there, the more I loved it.  \n\tI had come to Holland to learn about\
  \ my heritage. I eventually left feeling grateful to have familial ties there. For\
  \ a little country, Holland holds so much.  \n\tIt even has a hill."
