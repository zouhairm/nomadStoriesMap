Text: "When reading recommendations for the City of Camag\xFCey, one in particular\
  \ seemed so weird and wonderful that I simply had to go. El Lago de los Sue\xF1\
  os, or \u2018Lake of Dreams\u2019 is an amusement park on the outskirts of Camag\xFC\
  ey. The guidebook\u2019s description of \u201Can ice-cream parlour encased in the\
  \ fuselage of an old Soviet plane\u201D piqued my interest, but an \u201Cantediluvian\
  \ train-carriage-turned-restaurant\u201D was too intriguing to pass up. If you have\
  \ absolutely no idea what antediluvian means, you are not alone. Normally, I would\
  \ have pulled out my phone and Googled the definition. But when travelling in a\
  \ country where internet usage is restricted to only 15 hours a month, and you\u2019\
  re only able to connect at certain hot spots sparingly scattered around town, everything\
  \ unknown becomes a puzzle or a mystery that you have to solve for yourself. Guidebook\
  \ in hand, I imagined all the things that an antediluvian train carriage could be.\
  \ Perhaps the word meant outlandishly colourful, as everything is in Cuba. I envisaged\
  \ a train decorated like the rooms of my Cuban \u2018casas\u2019; one wall green,\
  \ one red, one blue, one yellow. Purple patterned curtains, chandeliers hanging\
  \ from the roof, and ornate mismatched cutlery. I simply had to go to this \u2018\
  Lake of Dreams\u2019, even if just to discover what the word \u2018antediluvian\u2019\
  \ meant. \n\nThe lake was a 20-minute taxi ride out of town. I was one of six people\
  \ piled into a car not much larger than a Mini Minor. Limbs hung out the windows,\
  \ and necks bent at right angles against the flimsy roof. In humid 30-degree heat,\
  \ air conditioning was four windows rolled completely down. The 60-year-old Soviet\
  \ Lada had blue peeling paint and stereo speakers held in place with cardboard,\
  \ blasting Cuban rap at 100 decibels. The back window was covered in large stickers\
  \ spelling out \u2018Hasta La Vista Compai\u2019, along with a sticker of a cartoon\
  \ man relieving himself on the car window. The driver sat comfortably in the front\
  \ seat wearing a flamingo-pink silk shirt attempting polite conversation in Spanish.\
  \ For him, this was a perfectly normal scenario for a Friday morning. \n\nArriving\
  \ at the \u2018Lake of Dreams\u2019 was like arriving at a deserted Soviet theme\
  \ park. Through the ticketed entrance gates the Malec\xF3n was lined with restaurants,\
  \ but lacked the customary gift shops that all theme parks sport. Each restaurant\
  \ was dated and kitsch, yet utterly charming in a uniquely Cuban way. The Malec\xF3\
  n \u2018parade\u2019 included horse and carts alongside 1950\u2019s trucks and Chevvies\
  \ roaring down the street to the beat of Salsa booming from the restaurants. \n\n\
  Perched next to the lake beyond the restaurants were the two iconic attractions\
  \ I had been waiting for. The plane turned ice-cream parlour was decked out like\
  \ a 1950\u2019s diner. Against a backdrop of red and orange stars painted on the\
  \ walls, laughing children ate sundaes. Beyond the aeroplane, sat my \u2019antediluvian\u2019\
  \ train, abandoned on the tracks as if it had broken down and no one had ever bothered\
  \ to move it. I anticipated the explosion of colour that would spill from the carriage,\
  \ but what I saw was not at all what I expected. The floor was wooden and bare,\
  \ the curtains drab and yellowing. Standing in the almost empty carriage, I still\
  \ wondered what \u2018antediluvian\u2019 actually meant. Days later, when I eventually\
  \ found internet connection, I discovered that antediluvian meant \u201Cof or belonging\
  \ to the time before the biblical flood\u201D, or if used humorously, \u201Cridiculously\
  \ old fashioned\u201D. Although the train carriage was old fashioned, it had an\
  \ old-world charm that transported me back to the days when Cuba was a Cold War\
  \ ally for the Soviets. \n\nThat day wasn\u2019t the first time I was mystified\
  \ by Cuba and its oddities. It seemed that every time I formed an expectation, or\
  \ tried to define Cuba, it would prove me wrong. If there is only one thing I learnt\
  \ while exploring Cuba, it is to forget expectations, and simply let Cuba entertain\
  \ you in its weird and wonderful way. If that journey means following an unknown\
  \ word to a Soviet theme park, then so be it."
