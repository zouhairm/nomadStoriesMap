Text: "The alarm sounds. I click my home button to silence it. The screen protests,\
  \ shinning 04:30 against my sleep soaked eyes. Five hours of sleep. Welcome to being\
  \ a tour guide. I sit up and half in a dream pull on my active wear and a hoodie\
  \ before stumbling out the door, water bottle in hand and phone, hopefully, in pocket.\
  \ \L\n\nThe girls are waiting in the chilled, early morning breeze and we head down\
  \ the lampless street, scattered iPhone torches and a slither of moon lighting the\
  \ way. We take a shortcut. A dusty road between backyards and vacant properties,\
  \ seemingly endless, it drags onwards into the night. Dogs, chained up in dry, grassless\
  \ gardens bark and we jump. Was this a good idea? In time we relax.\n\nWe reach\
  \ the base of the mountain. \u201CLook at that!\u201D Lori says, pointing at the\
  \ little, white church, two hundred meters up. Panagia Katefiani. Unseen spotlights\
  \ illuminate it but the precarious perch on which it stands is cloaked in shadows.\
  \ The ancient chapel appears to float. Another dog barks. We're startled by the\
  \ close proximity of the sound. It doesn\u2019t stop. In the darkness, we start\
  \ walking towards the trail, crunching volcanic rocks crumbled by almost a thousand\
  \ years worth of feet. A man starts yelling at us, hurling ferocious, foreign words\
  \ our way in the deep black. We turn off our torches and quietly panic. \u201CMaybe\
  \ we aren\u2019t supposed to hike before it\u2019s light?\u201D Vanessa whispers.\
  \ The disembodied voice comes again, angrier still and echoed by the stabbing bark\
  \ of the shapeless dog. Suddenly, Elizabeth realises, \u201CIt\u2019s the dog! He\u2019\
  s yelling at the dog!\u201D she laughs. Slowly our sleep-addled brains catch on\
  \ and we smile, exhaling with relief.\n\nThe hike begins. The path, if it deserves\
  \ such a title, is crude. Strewn with loose rocks and unsecured patches of dirt\
  \ which could leave the unwary slipping down a staggeringly close and uninhibited\
  \ edge. I question our judgement in making this hike before sunrise. As we pull\
  \ ourselves up steep inclines and dodge the excrement which is lovingly sprinkled\
  \ here and there by the donkeys, who make this pilgrimage daily, Jo begins to sing,\
  \ \u201CWe\u2019re all in this together,\u201D the High School Musical classic catches\
  \ us all off guard. We momentarily forget the ache in our lungs and descend into\
  \ laughter. \n\nShanelle is just visible, leagues ahead of the rest of us. She\u2019\
  s an avid hiker, ever pulled onwards by her thirst for the outdoors. Each time she\
  \ disappears beyond our sight we wonder if she has reached the top and speculate,\
  \ between shaky breaths, how long before we will too?\n\nThe sky had begun to brighten.\
  \ The purple that was once so deep it was almost black and the murky, Atlantic blue\
  \ were gradually evolving and as the stars twinkled their last, the tapestry moved\
  \ and breathed into life as it prepared to welcome Apollo. We turn to see the town\
  \ of Perissa, its white homes and dusty, desert landscape laid out before us. Straddled\
  \ by a great mountain range on one side and a devastating, black beach on the other.\
  \ A living postcard. The true Santorini. \L\n\nMy phone reads 05:58 and we press\
  \ on, along the ever dessicated and perilous path. A sign appears, \u201CAncient\
  \ Thera!\u201D I cry, praising the Gods for the end of our torturous climb. I run\
  \ towards it, expecting to find the Spartan ruins at any moment, instead, I am greeted\
  \ by a high, metal fence. A series of steps lie on the other side of it, leading\
  \ up to an even higher peak. Puzzled and disheartened, I read another sign, \u201C\
  Ruins of Ancient Thera. Open 08:00 - 15:00. Entry \u20AC12.\u201D Silence. Then,\
  \ \u201CYou have to pay?\u201D Valeriia says indignantly. I laugh. Jo suggests we\
  \ jump the fence. \n\nThe sun is threatening to crest the mythical Santorini horizon,\
  \ perpetually blurred by the smog of volcanic mist, creating one entity of the sea\
  \ and sky. We walk to a large near-by rock and set ourselves down. \n\nI have witnessed\
  \ thirteen Santorini sunsets in Oia, the famous image everyone associates with the\
  \ island and yet the sunrise that morning in Perissa, is the memory I cherish most."
