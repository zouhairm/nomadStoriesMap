Text: "Wake up in the am quiet seamless trip to the airport. I\u2019m boarding the\
  \ plane as the sun rises. I\u2019m still a little tired from the night before, as\
  \ a tradition I always stay up late and hang out before a trip. I planned to get\
  \ a little nap but never before take off. We take off and an minuets after, I fade\
  \ to black. I awoke hours later and the clouds tell me that the place and the people\
  \ I\u2019m going to meet will change me forever. And again I fade.\n\nLanding in\
  \ Rio de janiero was like transporting to a whole new dimension. It was amazing,\
  \ the colors, animals, the local plant life and the people were all beautiful, I\u2019\
  m astounded this is the place I needed forever. \n\n As soon as I get there I meet\
  \ a local guide looking to make a buck, an American buck that is. I asked, where\
  \ can I get a good ole Brazilian meal? He answered, my grandma has a restaurants\
  \ near the beach in town. I was excited, my 1st real taste of real Brazilian culture.\
  \ A warm greeting from his grandma and as I\u2019m eating there wer so many senses\
  \ engulfing me. My guide the asked me if I wanted a drink. And pulled out a bottle\
  \ of Cacha\xE7a, to his grandmothers disgust. We drank a few Caipirinhas and hit\
  \ the streets. All of the tourist spots by cab, we were clearly pretty tipsy. \n\
  \nI see a woman sitting wearing all white, smoking a cigar. Her white locks beckons\
  \ me, to ask her about the culture of the land, I\u2019m sure she would know. After\
  \ a brief conversation we found out that she was waiting for a bus to transport\
  \ her to a Afro-Brazilian spiritual function. I was curious so my guide and I took\
  \ her. I heard the drumming through the thick bush. We finally see massive amount\
  \ of people, drumming and dancing. This experience was excellent. Then someone rubbed\
  \ paint across my face red and white and told me I\u2019m now blessed. I did feel\
  \ that way. I stayed there in a hostel in Bahia. I lived their culture everyday\
  \ even got language lessons. Spent plenty of time at the beach. \n\nMy guide asked\
  \ if I wanted to do anything special. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, so he chose\
  \ to take me to a beach party, plenty of Caipirinhas, friendly people who wanted\
  \ to meet the foreigner, a lot of beach soccer play. I never wanted to leave. My\
  \    guide finally takes me back to Rio. And as always I stayed up late and partied.\
  \ The next day my guide  takes me to the airport. I felt like I was leaving home\
  \ to go to a distant land, my guide and I said Our fond farewell\u2019s and I jumped\
  \ on the plane back to Washington DC."
