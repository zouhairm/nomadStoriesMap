Text: "I am sitting with Abbas, holding hands -as it is minus 10 \xBAC- while hearing\
  \ his story about how he ended up here. I know it by heart but I like him to tell\
  \ me again as there is not much to do in a refugee camp. And I remember what made\
  \ me spend all my holidays coming to support the guys and the families on their\
  \ migrant process.  \n\n                                                       \
  \                     Exactly 2 year ago.\n\nThe first snowflake touches my nose\
  \ while my right thumb is up and the left hand holds the board: \u201CCroatia\u201D\
  . I stick my tongue out to catch the playful motes knowing that no one will pick\
  \ me acting dumb, but I have time. Zagreb is not that far. \n\nTime goes on, I only\
  \ get a few short rides, walk and walk and get lost.  \u2018Everything happens for\
  \ a reason\u2019, I mumble knowing that every difficulty on the road always transcends\
  \ into a good discovery. The white views are enchanting. Yes, I am still lucky.\
  \ \n\nActually I have never waited this long for a car. Getting nervous won\u2019\
  t help, but my limbs are freezing.  Finally someone stops. Thanks God. My clothing\
  \ is soaking and the board disintegrated because of the snow. The driver who picked\
  \ me up soon reduces speed. I look into his eyes and feel the trouble ahead.  After\
  \ 278 days hitchhiking from China, 10,000 kilometers overland, I can read drivers\u2019\
  \ minds. \n\nI notice that my pepper spray is lost somewhere in my backpack. The\
  \ driver stops. He grabs my face and leaps upon me. I manage to push him, pull my\
  \ things \u2013or should I leave them? -, and get out.  He speeds up and runs away.\
  \  \n\nThe snowstorm got angry.  I am engulfed in a white tunnel. My body has started\
  \ crying without consent, letting out a moan of distress. Does everything happen\
  \ for a reason? I desperately shake my arms to the few cars that pass by. It\u2019\
  s getting dark.   \n\nA van stops far, as if doubting, and I run as fast as the\
  \ snow lets me. \u201CAre you Syrian? Afghani?\u201D, they ask. \u201CSpanish\u201D\
  , I say realizing why nobody picked me up. We are close to the Croatian border,\
  \ the European Union gateway. Skeptical, the couple will drop me in the next bus\
  \ station. \n\nThe lady selling tickets barks \u201Cno credit cards\u201D and I\
  \ have no cash for any lift. I smile her. A rebel tear runs down my cheek. \n\n\
  A father and his son approach me, they are Algerians as many refugees here: \u201C\
  \xC7a va?\u201D. \u201C\xC7a va\u201D, I smile back, now from my heart. \u201CAre\
  \ you a new volunteer from the Spanish team?\u201D, they ask me. Amazingly, there\
  \ is a Spanish NGO team in this tiny random town. \n\nI spent a week with the guys.\
  \  They told me much tougher stories than mine, after all I own a golden passport\
  \ and a white face. I listened to them holding their hands to warm them up. Or were\
  \ they holding mines?  \n\n, by Paula Muga"
