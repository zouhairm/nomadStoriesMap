Text: "Paris was once all it was to be modern, urbane, sophisticated: a gilded temple\
  \ at once to Enlightenment rationalism and ancien regime splendor. The American\
  \ in Paris, now a clich\xE9 so well-worn that it may actually be coming back around\
  \ to being counter-hegemonic, became so because it was where the leaders and intellects\
  \ of that ideal-based nation came to imbibe the ideas that made it possible. Whole\
  \ generations of American leaders, political, academic and otherwise, regarded the\
  \ stay in Paris as an essential stepping stone to a well-rounded, mature outlook\
  \ on the world. This being a time when the other great imperial capital, London,\
  \ was still stuffy, choked with coal exhaust and deeply provincial despite its centrality\
  \ to contemporary global order. Despite the ever-greater ticking of rent prices\
  \ and the fact that the Champs Elysses is now roughly 75% luxury chain stores and\
  \ two-story McDonalds franchises, Paris retains a mystique that resists disillusion\
  \ down to its very essence.\n\nIf, indeed, all Western modernity can be traced to\
  \ the French Revolution, perhaps it is no coincidence that we who live in its shadow\
  \ seek to draw something from the paving stones that flew through windows to make\
  \ it so. Those Americans may have felt that their nation was, at the end of the\
  \ day, the superior one, but they felt a certain tutelage in liberte (if not egalite,\
  \ nor fraternite) could only be undertaken in the space where it had, in their mind,\
  \ bloomed the brightest.\n\nAt the same time, Paris cast a beckoning call to America\u2019\
  s outcasts, those born both of choice (think Hemingway), and those who never had\
  \ one (think Baldwin), who came looking to shake free of the entangling grimes of\
  \ prejudice and bad faith that stain the edifice of America\u2019s self-tributes.\
  \ In this tradition, the heroes tend to be the Left Bank intellectual scalpel-wielders,\
  \ the slogans those not of 1789, but of 1968, and the point is not so much to seek\
  \ the intellectual blood-origin of what has made one\u2019s world possible, but\
  \ to chisel at that world\u2019s edges, with the hope of eventually tearing it down.\
  \ The degree to which this experiment is now even possible, with the Caf\xE9 de\
  \ Flore charging ten euros for a Coca-Cola and the old flophouse rooms having been\
  \ turned into condos and Hiltons, is much more questionable. There may be a square\
  \ named for Sartre and Beauvoir near the places where they scribbled their letters\
  \ to future generations, but, their spirit seems to have evaporated, but for a few\
  \ select pockets, having gone elsewhere. \n\nDespite this, there remains an air\
  \ of living up to some past ideal that defines the expat experience in Paris. This\
  \ typically takes the form of wondering if one is making the most of the available\
  \ time there. Perhaps the greatest lie of Paris, like it is of any other place where\
  \ the mere speaking of its name conjures a very particular set of social cues, is\
  \ that merely by being there, you will become someone who belongs there. \n\nTo\
  \ wit, the distinct \u201Ccosmopolitan\u201D character of any place, Paris very\
  \ much included, may be on a death watch the moment it is deemed as such, the line\
  \ between \u201Ccosmopolitan\u201D and \u201Cfeatureless\u201D being very much a\
  \ thin one. Every city has its collection of post-everything, post-everywhere coffee\
  \ shops with collegial indie rock hovering overhead, but there is supposed to be\
  \ only one Parisenne caf\xE9. Singular in its features and conception, from the\
  \ d\xE9cor to the slicked hair on the wait staff, it retains a power learned from\
  \ the provocative jabs read in a freshman philosophy class. How much of this is\
  \ deserved is up for dispute, and perhaps the one we create in our collegiate naivety\
  \ will ever best the real thing.\n\nStill, if Paris-as-definitive-city is a dead\
  \ letter, this fact may only point to a wider truth. To become the you who belongs\
  \ in Paris is nothing less than to ascend to some higher place of self-fulfillment.\
  \ The paradox is that, for the truly ready amongst us (which I very much do not\
  \ include myself in), they are already there, no accordion buskers necessary."
