Text: "\u201CDee-Dee! Come, come!\u201D A small hand tugs on the hem of my kurta,\
  \ a long Indian tunic. Parmita leads me into a square room with red carpet and light\
  \ blue walls, hung with colourful pictures of Hindu deities. The room is full of\
  \ children of all ages, sitting, shouting, and vibrating with excitement. Sima plays\
  \ a chord on the harmonium\u2019s keyboard with her right hand, and begins to pump\
  \ the accordion-like bellows with her left, breathing life into her instrument and\
  \ sound into the room. Our crowd hushes, and all at once fifty voices erupt in song,\
  \ with words they know by heart. A hand drum beats, candles are lit, and incense\
  \ smoke twirls and dances. It is 6:30pm at Sri Ram Ashram, and arati has begun.\
  \ \n\nI have recently lost my own mother, and I am unsure about being here while\
  \ so untethered. Sri Ram is an orphanage in the holy city of Haridwar in northern\
  \ India, and is currently home to sixty-eight children - many of whom were found\
  \ abandoned on nearby city streets. Now, they live here and all share the same last\
  \ name. I look out over the balcony at the ashram\u2019s expansive courtyard - children\
  \ run and shriek over the uneven pavement, and older students sit at benches on\
  \ the grass, studying for exams in the pink, late-afternoon light. Macaque monkeys\
  \ patrol the rooftops with preternatural grace. \u201CDee-Dee\u201D is Hindi for\
  \ \u201Cbig sister,\u201D and it\u2019s what the kids here affectionately call the\
  \ older girls and women who help out at the orphanage, so this now includes me.\
  \  It feels strange to be welcomed so easily into their family, at a time when mine\
  \ feels so broken. I still have my western mind set about having to earn love. Here,\
  \ it appears to be freely given. Throughout the arati - a nightly ceremony where\
  \ light is offered to a particular deity - the kids try to teach me the words while\
  \ they sing, but I can\u2019t keep up. \n\n\u201CWe often have to guess at their\
  \ ages when they arrive,\u201D  says Rashmi, Sri Ram\u2019s Director. \u201CWe had\
  \ one girl come to us who was so malnourished we thought she was about eight. A\
  \ couple months being well fed and bam! Puberty. Turns out she was closer to thirteen.\u201D\
  \ A large and commanding woman with a sharp sense of humour, she leans back in her\
  \ chair and uses a piece of roti, a dense Indian flatbread, to scoop some lentils\
  \ into her considerable mouth. Some falls onto her blue kurta, but she continues\
  \ without a shred of self-consciousness. Rashmi has been the matriarch of this unlikely\
  \ family here for the past thirty years, when she came to India from America. \u201C\
  Some of them have been abused badly. There\u2019s a trio I\u2019m dealing with right\
  \ now - I call them the \u2018Giggle Girls.\u2019 They all have cigarette burns\
  \ on their legs. I\u2019ll try to get them to wash their dishes, but they just giggle.\
  \ What can I do? They\u2019ve been burned by cigarettes, and now they\u2019re happy.\
  \ I just let them do their thing.\u201D It\u2019s clear she\u2019s fought a lot\
  \ of battles for these kids over the years, and her scars are showing. Somehow,\
  \ this is reassuring. \n\nThe next evening I am sitting outside with Rashmi when\
  \ Parmita comes screaming by. She is wilder than the other kids. \u201CDeeDee! Loooook!\u201D\
  \ She yells, as she clambers to the top of a pole with ease. We smile and clap.\
  \ One of the older girls helps her down. \u201CYou know,\u201D Rashmi tells me,\
  \ \u201CParmita is one of the \u2018Giggle Girls.\u2019 She had it pretty bad. We\u2019\
  re not sure if she\u2019ll be ready for school anytime soon. But that\u2019s okay,\
  \ you know? She\u2019s alive, and she\u2019s here.\u201D As Rashmi walks away, I\
  \ notice Parmita is now carrying two year-old Vijay around, with a gentleness I\
  \ haven\u2019t seen in her before. She sits him down on a concrete bench and starts\
  \ to softly chatter as she brushes his hair with her fingers. I can feel something\
  \ give way inside me, making room for a small opening. If she can do it\u2026\n\
  But then the giant bell starts to clang, signalling time for arati to begin. A small\
  \ hand takes me where I need to go."
