Text: "I am Suraj Samim ,from Afghanistan,student of Spanish philology and a polyglot,who\
  \ can speak 9 different languages,i want to share story of my travel that started\
  \ in 14 July 2018 and finished in 12 August 2018 , period of the one month but the\
  \ most interesting thing is student from different part of the world, we were 1000\
  \ student from 118 countries. \nIn this travel I could find a family from different\
  \ regions ,countries, racists and religions. I could know that we can live together\
  \ , make this world better and can live in a friendship world .\nMy trip started\
  \ from Kabul to Sivas , Sivas is a famous and the biggest city of Turkey Anadolu\
  \ , the people of this city was friendly and kind , the first person who arrived\
  \ from my group that was me , we were 25 groups and that groups were divided into\
  \ the different cities , my group chosed from 19 countries , when I arrived to Istanbul,I\
  \ felt that this trip will be a little bad because i am a person from a country\
  \ that everyone thinks my country is a place of the terrorist and I thought they\
  \ will not be warm with me .\nIn 16 July all the people if my group arrived and\
  \ my trip story started.\nIn the first days i felt alone but after few days i could\
  \ feel strongly with a new family, the most important thing that i could understand\
  \ how that we can make new friends and how they can able to trust us like a family\
  \ member, Sivas was a historical city of the Turkey .\nThe youths from 19 countries,with\
  \ just a aim to speak Turkish and know Turkish culture by participating in the Turkish\
  \ classes and cultural programs, i felt very strongly because that was the most\
  \ important journey for me ,I could find the keys of 19 countries, a new family.\
  \ I could know the new cultures because by learning Turkish culture i could able\
  \ to share my country culture and also learn 19 different cultures. It was really\
  \ wonderful that by being in a group we could able to know and learn cultures that\
  \ we have in this world, in my opinion all part of this world can be same and beautiful,but\
  \ the persons that live in that part could show us that place more beautiful by\
  \ helping us ,and by reactions that they can able to show . \nIn my group that we\
  \ had peoples who didn\u2019t  want to speak with another peoples because the thought\
  \ that all people that we dont have any information about them can be dangerous\
  \ for us ,but after a few days and passing a few days with each others we could\
  \ able to know each others and we could be a family .\nThis trip was the most important\
  \ days of my life , i could learn and live with different people, i could understand\
  \ how we can feel a place more wonderful, is it just possible by watching or the\
  \ peoples will impact us ?\nIn my opinion that the water ,trees and the city structure\
  \ will not make an impact on us , but the people can make an impact on this things\
  \ , because that thing will show us the people of that place ."
