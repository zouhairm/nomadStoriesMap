Text: "He wears his smile like a child having tasted lemon for the first time. Out\
  \ of the twenty people I regularly meet for three hours in a day in a span of sixty\
  \ days, he\u2019s the one that stands out. \n\nWilhelm isn\u2019t exactly the kind\
  \ of person that anybody can get comfortable with. He speaks of trees that grow\
  \ teeth, colors are heard instead of seen and candies are ticket to paradise. \n\
  \nAs the only foreigner among the Filipino patients in the psychiatric center in\
  \ Cebu, his lack of familiarity with the local dialect didn\u2019t seem to bother\
  \ him or dampen his spirits. The majority of the confined residents in the center\
  \ where I have my apprenticeship share an almost similar nature of why they were\
  \ admitted. It was enough for Wilhelm to find a sense of community. \n\nEveryday\
  \ as I enter into Wilhelm\u2019s world and of his fellow patients, I get the kind\
  \ of feeling that incoherence is a fundamental aspect of life. Each one possesses\
  \ a gift of telling stories of grandeur, delusion, obsession and fantasy. Although\
  \ there are times that these elements seem to be all present, like major characters\
  \ in a play.\n\nDuring his moments of clarity, he confides with me his childhood\
  \ experiences in a small town in Bavaria where he grew up. His youth was about traveling\
  \ and exploring. His daily commute from his town to the city of Munich. His fondness\
  \ of festivals or \u2018fasching\u2019 and his love of beer. He tells all of it\
  \ gesturing his left hand as if raising a glass ready to make a toast.\n\nSomewhere\
  \ in his narrative, he blooms like the flowers in spring yet gradually snaps out\
  \ of his enthusiasm - skipping autumn and becomes cold - a winter Bavarian chill.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s easy to fall into his vortex of narrative. I began to imagine the cobbled\
  \ streets where he used to walk. The bakery where he got his daily supply of bread\
  \ opposite to the deli where the best sauerkraut can be had (he describes things\
  \ with ardent conviction). I thought of the many weddings he attended including\
  \ his own at the St. Michael\u2019s Cathedral on the famous Marienplatz square.\
  \ I wanted to visit Wilhelm\u2019s Bavaria.\n\nFew years down the line, I finally\
  \ made it to Munich. It was just after the migrant incursion on the German rail\
  \ station that made it to the international news. I wondered where is Wilhelm now?\
  \ What would he say about the Bavaria he once knew and the changing demographic\
  \ landscape of the Germany of today? Perhaps I may never find any answers to my\
  \ questions from a man who speaks of trees that grow teeth and believes that candies\
  \ are ticket to paradise.\n\nAll I know is that before my last day of my apprenticeship\
  \ at the psychiatric facility, he handed me a card with a cut-out heart in the middle\
  \ and before slipping into a different realm, he uttered \u201Chome\u201D."
