Text: On 29th December 2018 we had a  train from goa to Kolkata which was a 36 hours
  of traveling.My 4 best Friends accompanied me as well The trip was a  dream come
  true.The first day in Kolkata started with a trip to the Victoria memorial. The
  sun rays on the place made the palace look more beautiful. Second place was the
  zoo where we could see so many animals like the white tiger, the elephants, the
  beautiful peacock. The afternoon lunch we had was Puri bhaji which was so tasty.
  later we had to the mother Teresa house . that place gave me the best feeling of
  peace.  The third day we had a train late night to Darjeeling. We had to travel
  via sumo . We got the best room compared to others. Later we were taken to the famous
  lake which was completely covered with snow . We celebrated our new year with the
  beautiful snow. The best thing was that it was the first time I had seen snow in
  my life. The next day we went to a beautiful temple. The temple was located on a
  mountain so we could see the view of the full Sikkim . The tour went so smooth that
  the days finished so soon. When the tour ended it never came to my mind. This tour
  will always we remembered with lots of memories . The every night of the tour was
  so special. So much of fun. And then back to the boring old life I wish I could
  go back to those old days and slow those days so I could enjoy them again .
