Text: "It was in 2017 when i was just roving around and then i got to know that my\
  \ family was planning to go to Dubai. And from that day onwards I started dreaming\
  \ about how it\u2019s going to be. Kept questioning myself that is this really happening.\
  \ I remember everything about that trip from taking off to landing back. Our first\
  \ destination was Abu dhabi. We stayed at Raddison blue resorts. We reached at evening\
  \ so we didn\u2019t go out we stayed and rested near the pool side. There was this\
  \ sheesha man in a steel box like counter serving sheesha but we couldn\u2019t actually\
  \ pull sheesha because our parents will see . So we made friends with him we interfacted\
  \ alott and he let us pull sheesha from his counter for half hour and it was amazing.\
  \ People there are amazingly friendly than I ever thought. They changed my perception\
  \ towards strangers. Then next day we were going for site seeing . We went to this\
  \ beautiful mosque and it was quite mesmerising, that silence and peace was breathtaking.\
  \ We had our lunch and supper and came back to the resort after more site seeing.\
  \ Next day we went to ferrari world and it was amazing. I never screamed my longs\
  \ out on that roller coaster. I thought i was dead and couldn\u2019t scream more.\
  \ All the rides and games were amazing. The infrastructure was like it was a city\
  \ of its own. And later we left for dubai we stayed in a hotel. We reached late\
  \ so we had our dinner and went out for a walk. And we walked for ours till 4 am\
  \ . Met new people interacted with them. Found sheesha cafe for ourself near the\
  \ hotel . It was a rooftop cafe with beautiful music and people. Oh and the food\
  \ was delicious . We came back to hotel in early morning.  We went for site seeing,\
  \ visited museums and gardens oh it\u2019s still so fresh in my mind, feels like\
  \ i was there yesterday. Later we came back to hotel had dinner again went out roving\
  \ around. Bumped into some grocery store. Shopped various types of soft drinks that\
  \ we dont find here in india. We bumped into mcdonalds but it was open only for\
  \ take away. Still stood there talking to the female behind the counter. She was\
  \ amazing . So good to us. We came back to our room. We played board games and talked\
  \ alot we didn\u2019t sleep. Then next day we went out for gold shopping which was\
  \ the main motive for my parents\U0001F602 but i shopped too. Perfumes and other\
  \ bathing products. We experienced the ferry ride which we would never experience\
  \ here. Then at night we got onto cruise. Had dinner with beautiful music met cute\
  \ couples shot photos of them randomly without them knowing. We talked to them listened\
  \ to their stories they were so cute that i was sad because was single\U0001F64A\
  \ then we came back to our room. Went out clubbing it was Bollywood night and oh\
  \ my god girls night too. We drank our asses away . Then went for sheesha . Pulled\
  \ alot of it. Came back and slept. Next day we went to a mall to purchase a DSLR\
  \ for my friend and came back alone in a metro. ALONE. ALL ALONE. With the help\
  \ of strangers who guided me. Cannot be more thankful to them. Then we went to visit\
  \ THE BURJ KHALIFA. NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE THAT BEAUTY HUMANS HAVE CREATED. Then did\
  \ some shopping from DUBAI MALL. I Have never ever seen such a big mall where one\
  \ whole day is not enough to shop there. They had soooo many brands that it made\
  \ it difficult for my dad to empty his wallet. Because i knew i was never coming\
  \ to dubai after my shopping list\U0001F602\U0001F602 I so want to visit Dubai again.\
  \ We saw water show which was by the way the best show ever. Couldn\u2019t stop\
  \ dancing watching it. Our day ended there we came to our room exhausted but couldn\u2019\
  t sleep because we had to pack and leave the next day. I swear i never wanted that\
  \ trip. Best trip ever. \U0001F62D"
