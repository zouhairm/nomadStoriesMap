Text: "If you have ever been to New Zealand, I would not hesitate to say that you\
  \ are one of the lucky ones. This place was a magical mishmash of dazzling, weird\
  \ and wonderful things, all wrapped up in two little islands measuring a size similar\
  \ to that of the United Kingdom alone. \n\nIt is here on these two islands that\
  \ you can find almost every type of landscape you could possibly imagine, often\
  \ times crammed into the span of what you thought would be a rather simple, five\
  \ hour drive. It is here that you can meet the friendliest and funniest people you\
  \ may have ever met. And it is here that you can drink the best cup of coffee you\
  \ might have ever had. \n\nBut let\u2019s just get real for a moment. The java?\
  \ It is no joke. \n\nPicture this: You stroll up to that hole-in-the-wall caf\xE9\
  \ down Queen Street - the one with the old cacti in the window-sill and a cracked\
  \ and crinkled \"OPEN\" sign that hangs casually on an angle - unsure if it really\
  \ is open as the sign depicts. There\u2019s nothing stopping the solid wooden door\
  \ from swinging open as you give it a gentle push, so you walk inside to the jingle\
  \ of bells above your head. You look at the menu written in chalk, probably more\
  \ than a few years ago, and the barista nonchalantly wanders out from the back.\
  \ Briefly scanning the somewhat foreign list above, you pick the first thing that\
  \ stands out to you.\n\n\"A long black, please.\"\n\nYou're not actually sure what\
  \ it is but you go for it anyway knowing that since you like your coffee black,\
  \ you must be headed in the right direction. After the exchange of some strange\
  \ coins quite recently added to your old wallet, you head over to the large leather\
  \ sofa in the corner of the cafe. Scanning the news from that morning, you can\u2019\
  t help but be distracted by the sounds and smells coming from behind the counter;\
  \ the buzz of beans being ground by the machine and the scent of espresso as the\
  \ hot water makes it\u2019s way through the portafilter. After a few minutes of\
  \ this, the shuffling stops and your coffee appears to be ready.\n\nIt then comes\
  \ out with a cute little spoon sporting a chocolate covered espresso bean, teetering\
  \ precariously on an orange ceramic plate with chips around the edge. The cr\xE9\
  ma is so thick and velvety that you're not actually sure if you just ordered a black\
  \ coffee or a latte. So you have a sip, and then it hits you.\n\nThis might be the\
  \ best darn cup of coffee you have ever had.  \n\nAnd the most magnificent part\
  \ about it? It just keeps happening. Everywhere you go. So once you come to the\
  \ realization that New Zealand just has incredibly high standards for coffee, you\
  \ can finally hit the road and go on some adventures as you had originally intended\
  \ to \u2013 with a coffee in hand, of course."
