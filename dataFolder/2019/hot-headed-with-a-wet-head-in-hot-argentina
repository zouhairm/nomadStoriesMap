Text: "Water drops are slowly dripping from my wet head and soaking in my clothes.\
  \ My legs are numb after being 40 minutes seated in a seat not adjusted to my height.\
  \ I can hear cheerful chit-chats in the corner, yet noone seems to have the sligthest\
  \ desire to come over and explain what is happening. Reggaeton sounds are piercing\
  \ my body through my ear right to my empty stomach. It is almost lunchtime and yet\
  \ HE is nowhere to be seen. I start loosing my patience. \u2018Maybe HE forgot\u2019\
  ? I ask the girls. \u2018HE knows you are here\u2019 is the response I get.\n\n\
  Finally HE arrives with a bored face and \u2018Hola\u2019 forced out of his mouth..\
  \ The HE is the hairdresser in Rosario, Argentina. He does not care to apologize\
  \ for being almost 1 hour late. I do not care either. I make up a lie saying that\
  \ I have another appointment I can\u2019t be late for and leave with wet hair. I\
  \ leave the place to take a few deep breaths and walk 5 minutes. The heat evaporating\
  \ from scorching hot streets is drying my hair and my boiling emotions. I rethink.\
  \ Do I want to make yet another appointment and go through this again? I come back.\
  \ He is busy now, doing my boyfriend\u2019s haircut and chatting. \u2018So hard\
  \ to meet new girls now, you know\u2019 . Some time later I am ready to leave again.\
  \ Almost, as I am hit by an unexpected news of 20% charge on card payments. I struggle\
  \ in my head, should I or should not? Should I spare this 20% and ensure his turnover\
  \ is registered and properly taxed to support the drowning Argentinean economy?\
  \ Or should I pay in cash and spare some pesos for my next Malbec?\n\nThe thought\
  \ of Malbec takes me to the hairdresser visit in my bofriend\u2019s home town a\
  \ month ago. Completely different kind of a hairdresser. Punctual, smiling, accomodating,\
  \ entertaining, cared enough to offer me a cup of coffee, a range of sweet liqors\
  \ and even two boxes of my hair colour product. \u2018Just so that you can keep\
  \ the same colour when travelling in Bolivia\u2019. Leaving a comfortable chair\
  \ satisfied with the service, feeling treated like a princess and with a taste of\
  \ dulce de leche liqour in my mouth, I shortly understood. All made more sense after\
  \ hearing the last line of our client-hairdresser conversation. \u2018The SPECIAL\
  \ price ONLY FOR YOU is XX pesos\u2019. Of course, claro. I was brought here by\
  \ my boyfriend\u2019s mother, whose husband is this hairdresser\u2019s supplier.\n\
  \nThose of you who have some background to Argentinean economy, history and culture\
  \ are probably already smiling ironically. Those who look at Argentina only in steak\
  \ and wine categories may require a bit of explanation. The two extreme hairdresser\
  \ treatments I received are are symptoms of some of viral disases of this country.\
  \ The infection of cronyism, lack of customer care or business strategy and taxevasion.\
  \ The infections that I considered curable before my 2 months trip in Argentina.\
  \ Easy to say from afar. Harder to believe when you are surrounded by Argentinean\
  \ surreal reality where those abnormalities is a norm."
