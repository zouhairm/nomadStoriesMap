Text: "\u201CI have never left Melbourne.\u201D\nOne sentence. \nFive words strung\
  \ together that constantly haunts my thoughts, that haunts the menial tasks that\
  \ make up my days. \nOne disappointment. \nI have never ventured out of the confining,\
  \ metaphorical walls of my life of sameness and this is what truly frightens me.\
  \ It\u2019s almost as frightening as the looks people give me when I tell them.\
  \ \nWhen they tell me their adventures, I break my news to them. \nI tell them.\n\
  Yeah, I know it sucks, you don\u2019t have to remind me. \nWhat does really living\
  \ feel like? is generally the question that follows in my mind. \nOf course I want\
  \ to travel, to explore, to expand my mind. It\u2019s not a conscious choice to\
  \ remain put. I think they think that. I mean some people may actually be content\
  \ with never really travelling, but I, I shall never be fully content without seeing\
  \ what the world is like. \nI just \u2013 somehow in all the months and weeks and\
  \ days and hours in the 20 years I have been alive \u2013 have never had a chance,\
  \ or never been given a chance, to live a little. \nI don\u2019t think they could\
  \ ever understand. A pitiful, \u201COh, I see,\u201D but that\u2019s about it. So\
  \ I never tell them. \nI can\u2019t stand the pitiful glares that follow that sentence.\
  \ The alienating looks. The looks that never depict real comprehension to ever staying\
  \ in the same place for their whole lives.\nIt\u2019s not my fault, but it\u2019\
  s my problem. \nI have become jaded of the constant, repetitive, predictable notions\
  \ of my life. \nHabitual, yes.\nHabits are one thing, but to have your whole life\
  \ dictated by the same damn people and places and thoughts, well that, that is certainly\
  \ something else. \nThey say that familiarity breeds contempt and they aren\u2019\
  t wrong. In fact, they couldn\u2019t be closer to the truth. \nFamiliarity is nice,\
  \ it\u2019s comforting. Sometimes. But what do you do when every fibre of your being\
  \ screams to be set free?\nSo without another moment of contemplation, I set off\
  \ on my journey to be set free, because it is only in my power to do that.\nA year\
  \ in the making.\nI pull out the documents I need to submit, but don\u2019t tell\
  \ anyone at first in the fear that it will be ruined all in a moment.\nI keep quiet\
  \ for a while, but the excitement becomes too much, and I find myself broadcasting\
  \ to everyone my plans, my dream.\nI\u2019m going to Spain to study.\nThe acceptance\
  \ by my university is delayed, but my response isn\u2019t. \nI\u2019m going to Spain.\
  \ \nI step out into the summer air and I start to cry.\nI start to drown in the\
  \ overwhelming feeling of the unfamiliarity of everything, but then I resurface.\
  \ \nI resurface and take on this challenge, one beautiful, meaningful step at a\
  \ time. \nI remain in Madrid for the majority of my semester in Spain, but I travel\
  \ to some pretty incredible places.\nC\xF3rdoba, Granada, Sevilla.\nC\xF3rdoba.\
  \ A vibrant little city. \nI walk around for the first time on my own. \nSevilla.\
  \ The birthplace of my mother. \nI walk around as though I am in my mother\u2019\
  s shoes.\nGranada. A truly breathtaking city woven together by a mixture of Spanish\
  \ and Middle-Eastern cultures. \nI hike to the top of a hill encasing a beautiful\
  \ viewpoint of the setting sun and the Alhambra Palace. The colours blend together\
  \ like a watercolour painting and a woman near me begins to dance while another\
  \ man sings. \nI feel the power of his words as I simply watch, completely still.\
  \ \nHe sits just as close as me to the Flamenco dancer and he looks just as enamoured.\
  \ \nIn all the months and weeks and days and hours in the 21 years I have been alive,\
  \ this is a moment I\u2019ll never forget.  \nI hold my breath because I don\u2019\
  t want it to end. I don\u2019t want any of these moments to end.\nBut it ends. \n\
  But I will never forget. \n\u201CI have travelled to Spain.\u201D\nOne sentence.\n\
  Five words woven together by the memories that now fill my soul.\nOne dream."
